    "What did you and your friends do last night?",
    "We went to Fenway Park...",
    "...to see the Sox play the Yankees.",
    "That's great!",
    "How was the game?",
    "It was awesome!",
    "Dice-K was pitching.",
    "He struck out twelve batters!",
    "He was on fire!",
    "So, did the Red Sox win the game?",
    "They sure did!",
    "Pedroia hit a two-run home run in the ninth inning.",
    "Sounds like you saw a terrific game."
