    "I'm going to visit New York City on my next vacation.",
    "First on my agenda is going to a Broadway show.",
    "And after that I want to explore Central Park.",
    "I heard you can ice skate there in the winter!",
    "I also want to cross the Brooklyn Bridge,...",
    "...and see the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor.",
    "I won't have a car while I'm there,...",
    "...but there are a lot of ways for tourists to get around New York.",
    "You can take a train from Grand Central Station,...",
    "...or ride the subway to most points in the city.",
    "I hope I can see all these things in only three days!"
