    "You can't buy any decent clothes in Springfield.",
    "I'm so bored of the stores here.",
    "I prefer to browse the Goodwill store for used clothing.",
    "If you really look, you can get lucky and find something nice.",
    "The other day, I came across this beautiful cashmere scarf.",
    "It turned out to be a Burberry!",
    "It was like new, too!",
    "I bought it for just three dollars and went home, all happy.",
    "I love that store sometimes!",
    "The only thing was that the scarf had a slightly musty smell."
