    "What seems to be the problem with our friend Daniel today?",
    "He's been coughing a lot, he's tired all the time, he has no appetite.",
    "Uh-huh. Is he running a fever?",
    "Yes, he is. It was 103.7 when I checked last.",
    "Hmm. It could be the flu, but I'd like to see him just to be sure.",
    "Can you bring him in this afternoon at three?",
    "At three? Yes, I can do that.",
    "Thank you, doctor!",
    "You're welcome!",
    "See you at three. Bye!"
