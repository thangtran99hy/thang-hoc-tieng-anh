    "English is the world's second language.",
    "Your native language is your life.",
    "But with English you can become part of a wider conversation.",

    "So English mania is a turning point.",
    "Like the harnessing of electricity in our cities or the fall of the Berlin Wall.",
    "English represents hope for a better future.",
    "A future where the world has a common language...",
