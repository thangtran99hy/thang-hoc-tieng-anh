    "Hi, how can I help you?",
    "I have a pair of jeans I need to return.",
    "Sure. Do you have the receipt?",
    "Yes, I do.",
    "Okay. What's the reason for the return?",
    "Umm, I changed my mind, I don't like the fit.",

    "No, I don't need anything for now.",
    "Not a problem. That'll be $89.50 back on your credit card.",
    "Great, thanks!"
