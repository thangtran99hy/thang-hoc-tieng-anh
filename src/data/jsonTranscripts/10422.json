    "Don't you just love it?",
    "Love what?",
    "Tiffany's.",
    "Isn't it wonderful?",
    "Do you see what I mean, how nothing bad could ever happen to you in a place like this?",
    "It isn't that I give a hoot about jewelry, except diamonds, of course.",
    "Like that.",
    "What do you think?",
    "Well...",
    "Of course, personally, I think it would be tacky to wear diamonds before I'm forty.",
    "Well, you're right.",
    "But in the meantime, you should have something.",
    "I'll wait.",
    "No, I'm gonna buy you a present.",
    "You bought me one, a typewriter ribbon, and it brought me luck.",
    "Alright, but Tiffany's can be pretty expensive.",
    "I've got my check and 10 dollars.",
    "Oh! I wouldn't let you cash your check.",
    "But a present for 10 dollars or under,...",
    "...that I'll accept.",
    "Of course, I don't exactly know what we're gonna find at Tiffany's for 10 dollars."
