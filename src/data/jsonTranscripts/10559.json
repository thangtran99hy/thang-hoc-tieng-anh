    "One man from Illinois lost his coverage in the middle of chemotherapy...",
    "...because his insurer found that he hadn't reported gallstones that he didn't even know about.",

    "Another woman from Texas was about to get a double mastectomy...",
    "...when her insurance company canceled her policy because she forgot to declare a case of acne.",
