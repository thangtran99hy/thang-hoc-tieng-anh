    "...and there he is back there.",
    "So, that's Marcus' pop right here.",
    "We always tried to figure out how Marcus got so big...",
    "...'cause Jeff is not that big and his wife is even smaller.",

    "There he is, over there.",
    "Heisman Trophy winner.",
    "That's what I'm talking about.",

    "Tim's an inspiration to so many.",
    "A guy whose true strength comes not from the gym, but from his faith.",
