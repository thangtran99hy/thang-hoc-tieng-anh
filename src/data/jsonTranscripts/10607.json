    "Last night, I managed to take some time off...",
    "...to go to the restaurant, General Lafayette, with some friends.",
    "I had a Parisian dish called steak tartare.",
    "That is raw beef, prepared with a mix of ingredients...",
    "...including: ketchup, egg yolk, onions, Worcester Sauce, etc.",
    "In the restaurant, they even add nut chips and blue cheese crumbs. Yummy!",
    "Well, that is if you like raw meat, of course.",
    "I looked everywhere and could not find the origin of steak tartare for sure,...",
    "...but one thing seems to be certain: originally, it was meant to be horse meat.",
    "My friends told me that in the US,...",
    "...restaurants would be reluctant to serve raw meat because of liabilities."
