    "What if when you pressed on, you were on the Internet in seconds?",
    "What if your browser was your operating system?",

    "...or nagging updates, or lost files, or confusing settings,...",
    "...or Blue Screens of Doom.",
    "And there are no nagging updates,...",

    "...you can watch movies, interact with friends, you're creating documents,...",
    "...you're playing games, you're writing your e-mails. You're doing all of this stuff...",
    "...that you're already doing on the Internet.",

    "...the e-mail, it isn't stored on either device.",

    "...then your phone, your computer, all of these devices are what people call, stateless.",
    "Which is kind of a big word so maybe just remember this:...",
    "...Chrome is a totally rethought Web browser,...",
    "...you could download it right now on your computer.",
    "But Chrome OS is a totally rethought computer...",
    "...that lets you stop worrying about your computer...",
    "...so you could focus on the Internet.",
    "Which is what most of us use our computers for nowadays, anyways."
