    "But you've been doing it for so long that...",
    "...obviously, people know you from this show as well as from work on NHK and the radio.",

    "What's the feedback you get from people on the street?",
    "People like the show.",
    "The people that know about it generally like it.",
    "I don't think I've ever met anybody that watches the show and doesn't like it.",
    "Well, a lot of people don't go out of their way to talk about shows they don't like...",
    "That's true.",
    "...to the entertainer who's on the show.",

    "It's the same slot as Sanma-no-karakuri-terebi, desune? Here in Japan.",
    "Alright, okay. Yeah, okay. We're not gonna compete with that.",
    "At least, we used to be on Sunday nights at half past 12 or something.",
    "Oh, really? In America?",
    "No, no. Oh, In America it's seven to eight on Sunday.",
    "Exactly! So it's the same as Sanma-san here in Japan.",
    "Yeah."
