    "I went to Le Salon du Vintage recently.",
    "A sort of high end flea market dedicated to stuff from the late 60s,...",
    "...the 70s and the early 80s.",
    "The show took place in the heart of Saint Germain...",
    "...and it was a real success.",
    "You know, I try not to be one of those \"before it was better\" persons,...",
    "...but I still think that there is nothing more elegant than a woman outfit from the 60s."
