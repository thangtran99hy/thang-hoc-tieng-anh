    "Last night, I went to a party called \"The Intel Geek Party\" and it was a blast.",
    "I expected a bunch of nerds playing with their computer all night,...",
    "...but instead, I came across incredibly creative people.",
    "Hence, this \"dream booth\" invented by Armella Leung,...",
    "...who calls herself a \"multi medium graphic designer.\"",
    "It's made of a pillow on which dreams are displayed by a video projector.",
    "And of course, since the pillow has also built-in sensors,...",
    "...you can actually interact with your dreams.",
    "Who said computers are boring?"
