    "Sometimes, a person loves his house very much.",
    "Then he dies.",
    "That dead person can live in a house.",
    "It's in the walls and the floor.",
    "It's called, domus mactabilis.",
    "That means, monster house.",
    "It's Halloween.",
    "Tonight, there are going to be a lot of children at that door trick or treating!",
    "They're all going to die!",
    "Find the heart of the house.",
    "The heart must die.",
    "She's all I have.",
    "No, you have me too.",
    "I'm your friend.",
    "You were a bad girl.",
    "I must do this.",
    "Take this. I started it, you finish it.",
    "We did it.",
    "The house is dead!",
    "Constance is happy now...",
    "...and I can live my life.",
    "Thank you."
