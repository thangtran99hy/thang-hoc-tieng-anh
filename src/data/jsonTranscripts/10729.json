    "The evening was black and cold.",
    "Suddenly, something hit Buffy on the back of her head.",
    "She pulled a stake from her jacket.",
    "Soon, it was in the vampire's body.",
    "No more vampire.",
    "Wow! Look at her.",
    "Who is she?",
    "Buffy. Buffy must die.",
    "Drusilla needs more blood...",
    "...but that slayer makes it so difficult.",
    "Oh no! I'm a ghost.",
    "I'm Willow's ghost.",
    "Buffy? Are you OK?",
    "What? Who is Buffy?",
    "She's not Buffy.",
    "Who's Buffy?",
    "My little one.",
    "Frightened. Alone. No one can help you now.",
    "What's going to happen to us without the slayer?"
