    "I've devoted my life to studying past generations.",
    "Last year, I had a unique chance to work with my uncle.",
    "Our job was to find old treasures for a school's history foundation.",
    "He also hired a crew of students.",
    "They signed a contract to work with him.",
    "He was the boss.",
    "The place was strange, though.",
    "I dined on many things that I had never tasted before.",
    "They had an unusual flavor.",
    "We had been there about a month and hadn't found anything.",
    "One day, I began to dig in the soil.",
    "The ground's layers got wetter.",
    "Soon I was digging in the mud.",
    "My shovel began to get very heavy.",
    "It felt like it had doubled in weight...",
    "...because the ground had absorbed a lot of water.",
    "Finally, I saw something in the mud.",
    "It was an old knife!",
    "The handle felt smooth in my hand.",
    "I elevated it so I could see it better.",
    "There was writing on it.",
    "\"It says it will bring good luck,\" my uncle said with a smile.",
    "\"Why don't you keep it?\"",
    "I put it in my tent.",
    "The next day, we found many more things.",
    "There were pots, jewelry, and weapons.",
    "My uncle donated all of the things to a special committee.",
    "Many newspapers wrote stories about it.",
    "It seemed the knife really did bring good luck!"
