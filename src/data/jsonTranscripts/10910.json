    "Welcome to AERA English's Native Maestro.",
    "I'm your maitre d' Seita.",
    "And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.",
    "Today's Maestro Hook.",
    "The Hook is a good conversation piece you can use with a foreigner...",
    "...to get a good conversation going.",
    "Today, I wanna talk about what I've experienced with Japanese people...",
    "...in a meeting or in a class.",
    "When I'm doing a meeting or in a class, I ask everyone,...",
    "...\"Does anybody have any questions?\"...",
    "...and then, nobody answers.",
    "I think in Japan, by not answering, you're expressing that you have,...",
    "...\"No, I don't have any questions.\"",
    "But in Western culture, it's more like you're ignoring them.",
    "It's a little bit rude.",
    "So when I say, \"Do you have any questions?\"",
    "Maybe you should say, \"No\",...",
    "...or, \"Not so far\",...",
    "...or, \"I'm good\".",
    "And this is a good way to have a communication...",
    "...even during a meeting or inside a classroom.",
    "So, please keep that in mind.",
    "Okay. And today's Maestro Menu.",
    "Give me a minute.",
    "Give me a minute.",
    "Give me a minute.",
    "And the next one.",
    "That's a tough one.",
    "Oh, that's a tough one.",
    "Let me think.",
    "Yeah, that's a tough one.",
    "Yeah, give me a minute.",
    "So, Maestro Lines.",
    "What do you think of today's project?",
    "Will you think of any good solutions?",
    "Give me a minute, let me think.",
    "How do you feel about that?",
    "That's a tough one.",
    "Give me a minute.",
    "Alright?",
    "So, a good English in a business situation always on Native Maestro.",
