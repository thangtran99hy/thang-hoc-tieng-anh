    "In the last nine years, I have made many visits to the field with UNHCR.",
    "I do it to raise awareness for the plight of refugees, but I also do it for me.",
    "The refugees I have met and spent time with have profoundly changed my life.",
    "The eight-year-old girl who saved her brother taught me what it is to be brave.",
    "The pregnant woman in Pakistan taught me what it is to be a mother.",
    "And the paralyzed boy, who'd been shot in the back, with his big smile,...",
    "...showed me the strength of an unbreakable spirit.",
    "So today, on World Refugee Day, I thank them for letting me into their lives.",
    "And I thank you for coming."
