    "Tropical cyclones are called typhoons in Asia...",

    "Each name on the list starts with a different letter.",
    "The first hurricane of the year gets the first name on that year's list.",

    "...the second might be named Betty.",
    "The name lists do not include names beginning with the letters Q, U, X, Y, and Z.",

    "This list has a few personal names,...",
    "...but most of the names are of flowers, animals, trees, and other similar things."
