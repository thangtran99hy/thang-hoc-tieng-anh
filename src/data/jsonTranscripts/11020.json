    "So, this is my friend Frank and his retirement plan.",

    "They'll help you nail a retirement plan that's fierce.",
    "Two golden crowns.",

    "Frank!",
    "Oh, wow! You didn't win?",
    "I wanna show you something.",
    "It's my shocked face.",
    "Get a retirement plan that works at E*TRADE."
