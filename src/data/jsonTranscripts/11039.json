    "Bobo here can't fly.",

    "...and when you feel the rhythm of your heart, you fly!",
    "Keep it simple.",
    "Easy breezy.",
    "Thrust, lift, drag.",

    "No, we're still alive!",
    "From the creators of the Ice Age trilogy,...",
    "Alright, Blu! You're flying! Sort of.",
    "No, no, Blu. Wait!",
    "Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!",
    "We're gonna die!",
    "...Rio.",
    "You did not feel it in here!",
    "Easter. In digital 3D."
