    "Western people wanna know more about you because they are interested in you.",
    "So, when they ask you this kind of questions, don't be insulted.",

    "That's a personal matter.",
    "Private.",
    "Okay, and...",
    "Out of line.",
    "You are out of line.",
    "I'm sorry, that's out of line.",
    "For example,...",
    "...\"Excuse me, can I ask you a personal question?\"",
    "\"Oh, go ahead!\"",
    "\"By all means.\"",
    "\"Can I ask you a personal question?\"",
    "\"I'm sorry, it's a little bit out of line, isn't it?\"",
    "Alright. So, use English like this and you'll be speaking like a native thanks to me,...",
