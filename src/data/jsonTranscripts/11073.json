    "These new phones are too fancy.",
    "I don't know how to use them.",
    "It's easy. Watch.",
    "First, pick up the receiver.",
    "I don't hear a dial tone.",
    "You have to press the number of the person you want to speak with first...",
    "...or if you want to dial out of the office, press the number nine.",
    "Is there a directory somewhere, so I can look up people's extension numbers?",
    "They're on this list.",
    "These numbers connect you to other desks in the office.",
    "And when the phone rings, I answer it by pressing the flashing light?",
    "Right. And you can transfer a call by pressing hold and the extension number."
