    "Good afternoon! JP&B Associates. How can I help you?",
    "I'd like to speak with Larry Smith, please.",
    "Please hold while I put your call through.",
    "I'm sorry. I'm afraid Mr. Smith is out of the office at the moment.",
    "Would you like to leave a message?",
    "I wanted to check to make sure he remembered our meeting tomorrow.",
    "If you leave your name and number, I'll ask him to call you back when he gets in.",
    "Certainly. My name is Linda Strait."
