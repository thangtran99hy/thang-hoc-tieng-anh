    "Hi, Linda! I've been calling all morning, but the line has been busy.",
    "Hello? Can you speak up?",
    "I can hardly hear you.",
    "Who is calling, please?",
    "It's Diane! Can you hear me now?",
    "Hi, Diane! What's wrong with this phone line?",
    "Is your battery dying?",
    "It's not my cell phone.",
    "This line is terrible.",
    "Let me hang up and call you right back.",
    "Hello?",
    "Who is this? Is this Linda?",
    "There's no Linda here.",
    "I think you have the wrong number."
