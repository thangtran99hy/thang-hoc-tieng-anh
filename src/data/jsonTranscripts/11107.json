    "Is this Pizza House? We ordered a pizza over an hour ago!",
    "I apologize for that, sir. Can I get your name?",
    "It's Sam Strait.",
    "I'm sorry, Mr. Strait, but I can't find your order on our computer.",
    "What?",
    "I think there was an error.",
    "By some oversight, your order was never recorded.",
    "I don't know who is to blame for this. Do you know who took the order?",
    "No, I can't remember. This kind of service is totally unacceptable.",
    "I assure you, Mr. Strait, this kind of thing rarely happens.",
    "We'll get a pizza to your house immediately.",
    "We're very sorry for the inconvenience."
