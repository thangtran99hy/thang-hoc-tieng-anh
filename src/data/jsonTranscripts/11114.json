    "How did your call with Mr. Sanchez go?",
    "Great! I made a list of objectives before I called and referred to it during the call.",
    "That kept us both from wasting time.",
    "He didn't think you were too aggressive, did he?",
    "I don't think so.",
    "He was very agreeable and polite during our conversation.",
    "One thing I didn't anticipate was his sense of humor.",
    "I'm sure you did a great job representing the company.",
    "You always speak with such authority in meetings.",
    "And a trick I learned for the phone is to talk standing up.",
    "It really works!"
