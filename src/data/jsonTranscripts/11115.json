    "Did the chair already nominate someone to be secretary for the meeting?",
    "I don't think so. Usually Karen writes up the minutes of meetings in our department.",
    "She's always the unofficial secretary.",
    "What time is the meeting going to take place?",
    "It's scheduled for 2:30 in the conference room.",
    "I hope it adjourns before 5:00.",
    "As long as no major issues arise, it'll probably finish by then."
