    "Have you considered giving a workshop on presentations, Mark?",
    "What are you talking about, Bob?",
    "You must be kidding.",
    "No, bear with me for a minute.",
    "I thought you gave a very dynamic presentation.",
    "Really?",
    "I sensed a bit of hostility during the questions at the end.",
    "Not at all.",
    "I just wanted you to be specific about the value you see in...",
    "Of course I never did any formal analysis of the benefits of informal feedback.",
    "Don't interrupt.",
    "I was trying to tell you the organization, interaction, and professionalism of your presentation were impressive.",
    "Maybe you could contribute some tips to help others here give better presentations."
