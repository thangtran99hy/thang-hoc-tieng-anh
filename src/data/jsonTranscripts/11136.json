    "Hi, Sam. I was just calling to let you know my meeting at work finished on time...",
    "...and I'll be leaving the office soon.",
    "Unfortunately, a problem arose here, so I won't be able to leave for a while.",
    "In addition, we are facing a big deadline coming up Friday,...",
    "...so my boss wants to have a meeting tonight to tackle the root of the problem.",
    "Then, we'll have to postpone tonight's plans with Diane and her boyfriend.",
    "Yeah, it might be better just to reschedule with Diane for next week.",
    "I anticipate this problem will take a few days of working overtime to deal with."
