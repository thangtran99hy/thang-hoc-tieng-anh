    "So Linda, I'd like to get your opinion of how the meeting went.",
    "I thought it went very well. You had a clear goal and you stuck to it.",
    "Brainstorming suggestions was the only thing on the agenda.",
    "I think it also helped that you prepared your own suggestion to start with.",
    "That got people thinking before you went around the table to hear other people's views...",
    "...and I would add that your organization kept the meeting from running over time.",
    "Thanks, Linda. I feel we made real progress today with our sales strategy."
