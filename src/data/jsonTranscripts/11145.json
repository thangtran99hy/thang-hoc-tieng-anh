    "The most important thing about chairing a meeting is to have clarity of purpose.",
    "I can see how that can help the chair organize the agenda.",
    "And it can also help the chair keep the meeting on track.",
    "When discussion takes place,...",
    "...a clear objective guarantees the chair can tell when topics of irrelevance are taking up too much time.",
    "And that's when the chair needs to use her or his authority...",
    "...to cut off the discussion and refocus the meeting.",
    "Yes, but the chair shouldn't bully the participants or dominate the discussion."
