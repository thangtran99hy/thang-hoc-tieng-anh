    "I have a contract negotiation coming up this week, Linda.",
    "It might be a good idea for you to sit in to see the procedure.",
    "That sounds very interesting. Who is the other party in this negotiation?",
    "One of our suppliers.",
    "The company wants to renegotiate the contract we initially signed with them.",
    "What kind of deal are they looking for?",
    "I was informed that the company will only extend their contract with us...",
    "...if we agree to pay them a higher fee.",
    "They didn't specify how much,...",
    "...so the agenda of the negotiation will include bargaining on the new fee."
