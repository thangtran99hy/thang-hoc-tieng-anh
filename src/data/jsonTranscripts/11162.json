    "The last time we had a vacation, my husband and I went camping.",
    "I haven't been camping in ages.",
    "How was it?",
    "Marvelous.",
    "We stayed near an area that is a ski resort in winter, but we were there in the summer.",
    "There was a quaint little town in the valley at the base of the ski slopes.",
    "It was a little touristy, but very picturesque.",
    "Did you rent a cabin there?",
    "No, we camped in a tent.",
    "We spent most of our time hiking in the mountains,...",
    "...but on several evenings we went into town to look around and do some shopping."
