    "Every Friday after work, a group from the office goes out for Happy Hour.",
    "I was wondering if you'd like to join us this evening.",
    "I'd be delighted.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Happy Hour starts at 5, we'll leave the office a little early. Say 4:50?",
    "That sounds fine with me.",
    "Where exactly do you go?",
    "There is a bar and grill across the street that an old friend recommended to me.",
    "The food there is great and the atmosphere is very relaxed and informal.",
    "Great! I'm looking forward to it."
