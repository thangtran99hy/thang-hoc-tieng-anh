    "Linda, can you take a look at this and tell me if the punctuation is correct?",
    "Sure, Mark. What do you want me to look at?",
    "I'm not sure if this sentence needs commas or not.",
    "I'm not an expert on this,...",
    "...but I usually use a comma if I would naturally break or pause when reading the sentence out loud.",
    "In this case, you have an introductory phrase in the sentence.",
    "Put a comma here after the phrase.",
    "And what about this other sentence. Should I use a colon or semicolon?",
    "Use a colon before a list, and a semicolon between sentences.",
    "You need a semicolon here."
