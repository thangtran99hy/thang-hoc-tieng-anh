    "A new kind of attack is being used by dishonest people to steal IDs and credit card numbers from innocent web surfers.",
    "This new kind of attack is called \"phishing.\"",
    "Phishing sounds the same as the word \"fishing,\"...",
    "...and it implies that a thief is trying to lure people into giving away valuable information.",
    "Like real fishermen, phishers use bait in the form of great online deals or services.",
    "For example, phishers might use fake emails and false websites...",
    "...to con people into revealing credit card numbers, account usernames, and passwords.",
    "They imitate well-known banks, online sellers, and credit card companies.",
    "Successful phishers may convince as many as five percent of the people they contact to respond...",
    "...and give away their personal financial information.",
    "Is this really a big problem?",
    "Actually, tricking five percent of the online population is huge!",
    "Currently, more than 350 million people have access to the Internet,...",

    "Always be wary of any email with urgent requests for personal financial information.",
    "Phishers typically write upsetting or exciting, but fake, statements in their emails...",
    "...so that people will reply right away.",
    "Also, messages from phishers will not address recipients by name...",
    "...because they really don't know who the recipients are yet.",
    "On the other hand, valid messages from your bank or other companies you normally deal with,...",
    "...will typically include your name."
