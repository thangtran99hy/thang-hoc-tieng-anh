    "Hi, my name is Jeremy Gilley.",
    "I'm a filmmaker.",
    "In 1998, I was sick and hurt about what was going on in the world.",
    "The starvation, the destruction, the killing of innocent people.",
    "I was trying to make sense of a war that I was growing up in and finding it difficult.",
    "And so, I wanted to see if I can make a film about peace.",
    "But I realized there was no day of peace.",
    "There was nothing that united the world above politics and above religion.",
    "We have an Earth Day, we have a Valentine's Day.",
    "We should surely have a Peace Day.",
    "So, I decided to try and establish the first ever Peace Day with a fixed calendar day.",
    "A day of ceasefire, a day of nonviolence,...",
    "...a day of intercultural cooperation on a scale that we've never known before.",
    "So, I set out in 1999...",
    "...and I traveled the world meeting people like the Dalai Lama, Kofi Annan,...",
    "....Shimon Peres, Dr. Oscar Arias, Mary Robinson;...",
    "...going into Burundi, Somalia, Gaza, West Bank, India, Sri Lanka, Central America;...",
    "...all over the world.",
    "What I learned is, from speaking to humanitarians...",
    "...who are dealing with saving people's lives on a daily basis,...",
    "...is that if we had a day of ceasefire and nonviolence,...",
    "...we can immunize children, move aid, lives could be saved, children could be inspired.",
    "It was a day that had immense benefit."
