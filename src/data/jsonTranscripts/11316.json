    "That's where one gets the idea.",
    "If it weren't for the Mac, they would never have that in their products.",
    "And so, I guess, I am saddened not by Microsoft's success.",
    "I have no problem with their success.",
    "They've earned their success for the most part.",
    "I have a problem with the fact that they just make really third-rate products."
