    "Hi, my name is Steven Purugganan.",

    "Hi, my name is Brian Purugganan.",
    "And we are all sport stackers.",
    "I hold four Guinness World Records including a Cycle stack in 5.93 seconds.",
    "We got into sport stacking when my brother Andrew saw the 2006 world championships on ESPN.",
    "So, he thought it was really cool and he showed all of us...",
    "...and we all thought it was really cool, so we asked my mom to buy a set.",
    "And she did eventually and ever since, we've just been practicing, getting better and better.",
    "In the beginning, we practiced a lot because we had no idea what it was...",
    "...but after a while, it becomes second nature and we just get used to it.",
    "I practice about an hour a day, every day of the week...",
    "...and after a year or so, that's when we got better and better.",
    "It's a great feeling to hold a Guinness World Record because...",
    "...I never thought that I would hold a world record at all or be in the book.",
    "And now that we're gonna be in the book, it's a great feeling."
