    "A wolf saw a lamb in the field.",
    "He wanted to eat him but needed an excuse for killing the young animal.",
    "He went up to the lamb and said, \"Last year, you were rude to me.\"",
    "\"I could not have been rude to you last year,\" the lamb replied.",
    "\"I am only a week old.\"",
    "The wolf thought of another excuse.",
    "\"You were eating in my field,\" he said.",
    "\"That's not possible,\" the lamb said.",
    "\"I only drink my mother's milk.\"",
    "\"I'm not going to argue with you,\" the wolf said.",
    "And he killed the lamb and ate him."
