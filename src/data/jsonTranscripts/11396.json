    "A wolf had a bone stuck in his throat and it hurt very much.",
    "The wolf asked a bird to use her beak and pull the bone out.",
    "He promised to pay the bird when the bone was out.",
    "The bird did as he was asked and pulled the bone out.",
    "Then, she asked for the promised payment.",
    "\"I'm not going to pay you,\" the wolf said.",
    "\"You're lucky I didn't eat you when you had your head in my mouth!\"",
    "Then, he ran off."
