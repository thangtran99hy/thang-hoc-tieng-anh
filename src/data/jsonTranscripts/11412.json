    "One cold winter's day, the ants were drying the corn they had collected in the summer.",
    "A grasshopper came to the ants and asked them for a little food.",
    "He was hungry because he could not find any corn growing in the fields.",
    "The ants asked him, \"Why didn't you put some corn aside for the winter...\"",
    "\"...during the summer when there was plenty in the fields?\"",
    "The grasshopper replied, \"I didn't have time.\"",
    "\"I was busy singing.\"",
    "The ants all laughed at him and said,...",
    "\"If you were foolish enough to sing all summer,...\"",
    "\"...then you must go to bed hungry in the winter.\""
