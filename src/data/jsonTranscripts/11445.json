    "The Internet is one of the great technological advances in history.",
    "Billions of people have been using the Net, surfing the web, going on 20 years now.",
    "But when it comes to issues of privacy, the Internet is still something of a new frontier.",
    "The \"Dog Poop Girl\" and the \"Star Wars Kid\" were painfully aware...",
    "...they had lost all sense of privacy on the Internet.",
    "But millions of people have no clue data is being collected on them...",
    "...and shared with others without their knowledge.",
    "Take Facebook for instance.",
    "Facebook collects stuff about you constantly and uses this information to attract advertisers.",
    "This greatly concerns privacy rights advocates like Mark Rotenberg with the Electronic Privacy Information Center.",
    "\"Google, the largest online advertiser in the world,...",
    "...you may soon forget about searches you make but Google does not,\" according to Rotenberg.",
    "Google then shares this knowledge with advertisers.",
    "Google and other private companies say data is collected to provide better service to their customers.",
    "So whether you're sitting on a train...",
    "...or doing a Star Wars dance...",
    "...or posting on Facebook...",
    "...or searching on Google, the eyes of the Internet may be watching.",
    "And what the Internet sees, it never forgets.",
    "This is a fact people born and raised in the age of the Internet should not forget.",
    "On the Internet, you have to think before you post.",
    "Remember those posts are never gonna go away.",
    "Also, be aware of any personal information you give out on the Internet,...",
    "...you never know how it's gonna be used or by whom.",
    "And now you know."
