    "Two friends were traveling together when they met a bear on their path.",
    "One of them quickly climbed up into a tree.",
    "He did not help his friend climb up...",
    "...so the other man lay on the ground and pretended to be dead.",
    "The bear came up to him and smelled him all over.",
    "Then the bear said something in the traveler's ear.",
    "The bear didn't think the traveler would taste good, so he went away.",
    "When the bear had gone, the other traveler came down from the tree.",
    "\"I saw the bear say something in your ear,\" he said.",
    "\"What did it say?\"",
    "\"It told me,\" the man said,...",
    "...\"never to travel with someone who runs away when there is danger.\""
