    "And my Guinness World Record is the most balloons blown up by nose in three minutes.",
    "I discovered that I could blow a balloon with my nose when I was seven years old.",
    "I was sitting in the back of my car...",
    "...one day and I was really bored and I decided that I'd try something new.",
    "I decided that I'd go for the world record because I...",
    "...showed a bunch of my friends there and they, no one else that I knew, could do it.",
    "So, I decided that...",
    "...if this is so unique then, maybe I can set a world record with it.",
    "My goal is to try to break the record once a year until I can't beat it anymore."
