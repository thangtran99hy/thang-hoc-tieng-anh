    "Eighteen years ago, when Wayde was about thirty years of age, he was a failure.",
    "This was surprising because he was a clever man, and most people liked him.",
    "Wayde's best friend was a doctor, an older man named Manningtree.",
    "One day, Manningtree said to Wayde, \"I have known you for many years, Wayde...",
    "...and I am surprised you are such a failure.\"",
    "\"Your problem, Wayde,\" Manningtree said,...",
    "...\"is that you have no confidence in yourself.\"",
    "\"And I'm sure that if you were more confident,...",
    "...you could be very successful in everything.\"",
    "\"Oh, I don't think so,\" Wayde said.",
    "\"Every time I try to do something, I am sure I shall fail.\"",
    "\"The reason you think that,\" Manningtree said,...",
    "...\"is that you suffer from nerves.\"",
    "\"You're right,\" Wayde said.",
    "\"I do worry and I am nervous about everything.\"",
    "\"But what can I do about it?\"",
    "\"There is a medicine that cures nerves,\" Manningtree said.",
    "\"Just take one small drop of the medicine once a month,\" Manningtree said.",
    "Wayde took the bottle from his friend.",
    "Once a month, he took one small drop.",
    "The effect was immediate.",
    "Suddenly, he was not nervous anymore."
