    "A man had an ass and a very pretty little pet dog.",
    "The ass slept in a warm stable at night and had plenty to eat,...",
    "...but he had to work hard during the day.",
    "The pet dog, on the other hand, lived in the house,...",
    "...slept in its master's bed,...",
    "...and had no work to do.",
    "Its master gave it all kinds of nice things to eat and played with it.",
    "The dog never did any work.",
    "The ass thought it was not right that the dog had such an easy life...",
    "...while he had to work.",

    "...\"then I'll have the same kind of life as the dog\".",
    "He went into the house, jumped on the bed,...",
    "...and jumped up at his master the way the dog did.",
    "His master did not give him a better life, however.",
    "Instead, he hit him with a stick and chased him out of the house.",
    "\"I have been foolish,\" the ass thought.",
    "\"I should not have tried to be like a dog because I am not a dog.\""
