    "First, how do you get to high school in America?",
    "Well, when I was in high school or junior high, there's no Internet, so I can't...",
    "...like look up things in America.",
    "So, I bought this magazine called \"Ryugaku Journal\"...",
    "Uh-huh!",
    "...and they listed all the schools, high schools in America like East Coast, West Coast,...",
    "Wow!",
    "...and I looked for the schools, high schools with no Japanese students,...",
    "Cool! Good approach.",
    "...'cause I didn't know any other way. I mean, how can I compare, you know.",

    "Well, it's the same as, you know, a lot of American kids learn Japanese from an American teacher.",
    "Yeah.",
    "And so, they come and say something like, \"Watashi wa\",...",
    "...\"watashi wa onaka ga suita\".",
    "Yeah. But, you know, what can you do?"
