    "A poor fisherman went down to the sea every day.",
    "One day, he threw his net into the sea four times.",
    "The fourth time, it had a large jar in it.",
    "\"Perhaps there is something in the jar,\" the fisherman thought.",
    "He took off the lid and looked into the jar.",
    "He could not see anything,...",
    "...then smoke came out of the jar.",
    "Soon, the smoke turned into a cloud, and the cloud turned into a genie.",
    "\"Who are you?\" He asked the genie.",
    "\"What do you want?\"",
    "\"You are an unlucky man,\" the genie said.",
    "\"I promised myself that I would kill the person who let me out of the jar.\"",
    "The fisherman did not want to die, but he did not know what to say to the genie.",
    "Then, he had an idea.",
    "He said, \"I don't think you were in the jar.\"",
    "\"I think you came from somewhere else.\"",
    "\"Don't argue with me. I was in the jar,\" the genie said angrily.",
    "\"Prove it,\" the fisherman said.",
    "\"Go back into the jar and then come out again.\"",
    "\"All right, I will,\" the genie said.",
    "\"When I come out, I shall kill you!\"",
    "The genie turned into smoke and went back into the jar.",
    "Immediately, the fisherman put the lid on the jar.",
    "\"Let me out!\" The genie shouted from inside the jar.",
    "\"You'll kill me if I do,\" the fisherman said.",
    "\"No, I won't. I'll make you rich!\" The genie shouted.",
    "\"Do you really promise to make me rich?\" he asked the genie in the jar.",
    "\"Yes, just let me out.\""
