    "You mentioned last night when we were having dinner that when you first got the job as CEO,...",
    "...you got a call from Steve Jobs and he offered you some advice?",
    "Well, he didn't call to offer me advice,...",
    "...but we have worked together on a Nike - Apple collaboration called Nike Plus.",
    "So, we took what Apple knows, what Nike knows and, you know, brought a new technology to the market.",
    "Anyway, long story short, he said, \"Hey, congratulations.\"",
    "\"It's great.\"",
    "\"You're gonna do a great job.\"",
    "I said, \"Well, do you have any advice?\"",
    "And he said, \"No, no. You're great.\"",
    "And then there was a pause...",
    "...and he goes, \"Well, I do have some advice.\"",
    "He goes, \"Nike makes some of the best product in the world.\"",
    "\"I mean, product that you lust after, absolutely beautiful, stunning product.\"",
    "\"But you also make a lot of crap.\"",
    "He said, \"Just get rid of the crappy stuff and focus on the good stuff.\"",
    "And then I expected a little pause and a laugh,...",
    "...but there was a pause but no laugh at the end.",
    "Yeah.",
    "And he was absolutely right.",
    "And in fact, that's one of my major focal points in terms of my priorities as a CEO...",
    "...and even as a designer when I was growing up at the company, is to edit.",
    "We have so many ideas.",
    "Nike is an idea factory."
