    "She was not like her sisters.",
    "They were happy living in the sea.",
    "The little mermaid was not happy.",
    "But she could not leave the sea.",
    "She had to wait until she was 15 years old.",
    "At last, the little mermaid was 15 years old.",
    "\"Now, you can go up out of the sea,\" said her grandmother.",
    "The little mermaid swam up out of the sea.",

    "\"I will not help you for free,\" the sea witch said.",
    "\"I want your beautiful voice.\"",
    "\"I will turn your tail into legs.\"",

    "\"You will also die if the prince does not marry you.\"",
    "The little mermaid really wanted to be with the prince, so she agreed."
