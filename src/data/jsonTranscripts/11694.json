    "This is George Takei.",
    "Days ago, we watched in collective horror as the earth shook and the waters rose in Japan.",
    "Thousands lost their lives.",
    "Many thousands more are still unaccounted for.",
    "And countless remain without food, clean water, shelter or power in the bitter winter.",
    "Today, we must act with collective resolve.",
    "In Japanese, we say, \"gaman\".",
    "It means, \"to endure with fortitude and dignity\".",
    "In the spirit of \"gaman\", I ask you for help today.",
    "Even small amounts, given with great amounts of heart, can make a real difference.",
    "At times like this, we are all Japanese.",
    "Thank you."
