    "Hi! My name's Peter Ash.",
    "I came up with the idea for my GCSE project.",
    "Got home one night, my sister's hamster is running around the wheel.",
    "So, I went back to college and I came up with the hamster - powered mobile phone charger.",
    "So, it's quite simple really. You have a hamster running around on the wheel...",
    "...and then it goes through to this gearing system.",
    "It goes through this circuitry, and then it charges your mobile phone.",
    "I did have, once in America, an email saying,  \"Could you generate a bigger version for my horse?\".",
    "You need a hell of a lot to power a house.",
    "It's really not practical and the mess you've got to clear up afterward as well."
