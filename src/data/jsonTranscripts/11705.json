    "My name is Bobby Ray, the artist known as B.o.B.",
    "Basically, I make good vibrations for the masses across the globe.",
    "My music style in three words or less: from outer space.",
    "A lot of things inspire me, like, it comes from everywhere.",
    "The highest point of my music career thus far: releasing my first album.",
    "You know for me, like, it's just finally getting over that first step.",
    "The lowest point for me was probably getting booed at my high school talent show.",
    "It was the lowest point for me, but it was the best...",
    "...because that's what gave me the fire that I needed to, you know, get back up."
