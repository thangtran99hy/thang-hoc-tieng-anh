    "So, we certainly did have a great year at Google...",
    "...and I'd really like to think some of it stems from the unique way that we manage our product and engineering machine. ",

    "...one of our concerns was that as we scaled, this approach might lead to our being spread too thin.",

    "So, let's talk about what we changed.",
    "At the beginning of the year, we decided to double down on the core...",
    "...so that's search and search ads,...",
    "...and I think the financial numbers that you guys are seeing today,...",
    "...reflect the fact that that was a successful bet.",
    "But behind those numbers...",
    "...is a really relentless stream of new features and product innovations. "
