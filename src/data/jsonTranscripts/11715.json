    "The bigger the problem, the bigger the opportunity.",
    "And the book is about how you actually make things happen,...",
    "...how to challenge assumptions, break the rules, make your own luck,...",
    "...all the things you need to know to actually make your ideas come to life.",
    "OK great, and then so did you actually give this book to your son?",

    "Really?",
    "The week he turned 20, the book came out.",
    "Wow.",
    "Isn't it wonderful? Yes, it was.",
    "Then of course that is a problem for what was I gonna do for his 21st birthday?",

    "I've made it bigger and bigger, right there.",
    "OK. And then what kind of comment did you hear first?",
    "\"Oh, that was horrid\". No, I'm kidding. I think he's very proud.",
    "He's really excited that the book is so popular here in Japan."
