    "...Tsunamis.",
    "Even with the monitoring systems introduced in the 20th century,...",
    "...tsunamis often strike with little or no warning.",
    "Over the millennia, they have killed hundreds of thousands of people.",
    "From ancient Greece, pre - conquest North America, and feudal Japan...",
    "...to Alaska, India and Sri Lanka in modern times.",
    "They originate from volcanic eruptions, earthquakes,...",
    "...large landslides and even meteor impacts in the ocean.",
