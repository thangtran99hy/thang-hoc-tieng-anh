    "In a nuclear energy facility, a chain reaction of splitting atoms releases heat.",
    "This reaction takes place in the reactor.",
    "All reactors are designed, built, and operated with safety as a top priority.",
    "Nuclear energy facilities are among the safest facilities in the world...",
    "...because they feature multiple redundant layers of safety systems and procedures,...",
    "...beginning in the core of the reactor.",
    "In a nuclear reactor, metal rods with enriched uranium pellets inside are placed into bundles, creating a fuel assembly.",
    "The bundles are submerged in water inside a pressurized vessel.",
    "The two most common types of nuclear reactors are boiling water reactors and pressurized water reactors.",
    "In a boiling water reactor,...",
    "...the heat from split atoms causes the water to boil, producing steam that drives the turbine.",
    "Afterwards, the steam is converted back to liquid water and returned to the reactor core.",
    "Pressurized water reactors or PWRs were developed after boiling water reactors,...",
    "...and work in a slightly different manner.",
    "In a PWR, the water in the reactor tank is under pressure to keep it from boiling,...",
    "...even though it reaches very high temperatures.",
    "In the steam generator of a PWR, water passes through thousands of small pipes.",
    "The heat in the pipes turns the water to steam, which then drives the turbine.",
    "The turbine powers the generator, which in turn produces electricity.",
    "Here is where the process differs from a boiling water reactor.",
    "The reactor water is now pumped back into the reactor tank and heated again.",
    "The steam from the turbine is cooled in a condenser...",
    "...and the resulting water is sent back into the steam generator and heated again.",
    "To prevent overheating, control rods made of a material that absorbs small atomic particles...",
    "...are inserted into the nuclear fuel bundle.",
    "When an operator wants to produce more heat, the control rods are raised out of the bundle.",
    "To create less heat, they are lowered into the bundle.",
    "The rods can also be lowered completely to shut the reactor down...",
    "...in the case of an accident or to refuel the facility.",
    "With this level of control,...",
    "...the operator of a nuclear energy facility is able to ensure that it continues to generate clean, safe, and secure energy."
