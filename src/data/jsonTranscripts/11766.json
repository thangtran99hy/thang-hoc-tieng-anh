    "Hi, this is Paul Reagasmerf of Sharp Electronics. I'm the national account manager for distribution.",
    "And what you're looking at here is what we call our i3 wall,...",
    "...which is an array of 64 60 - inch full array LED panels with 720p resolution.",
    "The bezel, as you can see, is super thin. It's a 6.5 millimeter or 3/8 of an inch.",
    "And what we're doing is we have 16 media players, which each media player...",
    "...is sending the signal or the content to four panels. So that has to be into 64 panels.",
    "And then, the software that you're seeing now...",
    "...is all custom software that was created in Japan. I don't know what the program is,...",
    "...but it is custom.",
    "But again, this is just to show you what you can do with our product.",
    "And these are professional displays that come with twenty-four seven warranty, three - year warranty...",
    "...and typically we use these as a video wall, either 3x3 or 4x4 or 5x5.",
    "And then, what you do is you just daisy chain them together via DVI or another type of source...",
    "...and you just play whatever content you want on here.",
    "So, what you're looking at really is a 3D cube without the glasses."
