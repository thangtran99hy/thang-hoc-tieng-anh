    "So, the first question I'm gonna ask came in video form but it's also gonna be my first question.",
    "It comes in from a user, acertainresonance, and we'll go ahead and roll that video question.",
    "Hi Gaga.",
    "Well, my first question that I wanted to ask was how are you?",
    "I remember in one of your interviews you said that that was a question that...",
    "...interviewers never really asked you and actually meant it.",
    "And so I wanted to ask you and actually mean it. So how are you?",
    "Well, I am absolutely wonderful and a little bit choked up,...",
    "...because that is why I am still here and why I work so hard, it's because...",
    "...I really am very blessed to have fans with such a beautiful spirit,...",
    "...and I'm sure you can see just from that one video very much what a lot of my day is like.",
    "I do spend a lot of time on Google, looking for fan videos and messages...",
    "...and I'm doing wonderful today. And I would say that...",
    "...the only reason I ever mentioned that people don't ask me how I am genuinely...",
    "...is because it took a lot of bravery to get to where we are today.",
    "A lot of people see glasses and shoulder pads and crazy outfits and...",
    "...over the years it was very difficult to do interviews...",
    "...because that's all people would talk about.",
    "So, I guess what I would say is I'm doing wonderful now because of how brave that...",
    "...all my fans have made me. So thank you for making me brave and I hope I can...",
    "...make you brave."
