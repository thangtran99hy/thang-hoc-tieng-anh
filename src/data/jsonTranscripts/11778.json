    "If so, what did you say to them?",
    "I wouldn't say \"apologize\"; there's been a lot of concert ticket requests!",
    "And I think one of the most awkward things that anyone ever said to me was,...",
    "...\"Well, my my. How the tables have turned.\"",
    "But to be honest, I don't have that kind of vengeful spirit in myself.",
    "And I never did. It was just more that,...",
    "...and I say this with so much genuineness from my heart, is that...",
    "...bullying really stays with you your whole life.",
    "And it really, really never goes away, and I know...",
    "...you're using words like \"superstar\" and \"most Googled\" and...",
    "...\"billions of Youtube videos\" but,...",
    "...I was never the winner; I was always the loser.",
    "And that still stays with me.",
    "And do I wanna stick it to anybody? No.",
    "I just wanna make music."
