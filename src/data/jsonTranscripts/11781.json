    "Hi.",
    "I was marooned on an island for five years with this package...",
    "...and I swore that I would deliver it to you...",
    "...because I work for FedEx.",
    "That's very admirable, thank you.",
    "Hey, by the way, what's in the package?",
    "Nothing really, just a satellite phone, GPS locator, fishing rod, water purifier and some seeds.",
    "Just silly stuff.",
    "Thank you again.",
    "You keep up the good work."
