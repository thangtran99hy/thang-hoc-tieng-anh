    "I have to rush!",
    "I promised to baby-sit my cousin, since my sister and brother-in-law are both working.",

    "But what we have to think about is who will take care of the baby.",
    "Regarding the baby-sitting, in my opinion, the wife would be much better than the husband at baby-sitting.",
    "And I think the mothers' role is very important to their baby,...",
    "...especially when their child is very young."
