    "Mi-na, every April 5th is what is known as the so-called \"Day of Trees\" in Korea, right?",
    "It's a day to think about reforestation and tree - planting...",
    "...and it seems like Korean people do have a lot of interest in planting trees.",
    "Is there a particular reason for that?",
    "Have you planted a tree before?",
    "I have, in fact!",
    "When I was little I used to climb a mountain with my dad and plant a tree.",
    "That was almost 10 years ago,...",
    "...and back then, we didn't feel that it was urgent to plant a tree,...",
    "...but now people are urged to plant trees because of yellow dust, Asian dust, or yellow sand,...",
    "...whatever you want to call it, coming from China.",
    "The dust originates in the deserts of northern China...",
    "...where high - speed surface winds and intense dust storms kick up dense clouds of dry soil particles.",
    "During the spring, you will see many people wearing masks.",
    "Well, in fact, in the last decade or so,...",
    "...it has become a serious problem due to industrial pollutants,...",
    "...hence, some environmentalists are suggesting that planting as many trees as possible in China...",
    "...will help reduce the level of yellow dust.",
    "That sounds reasonable.",
    "I guess the government should encourage citizens to plant more trees.",
    "What do you think about giving a reward for planting 20 trees in one day?"
