    "You should get nutrition from all sorts of food;...",
    "...meat, fruits, and vegetables to have a healthy diet.",
    "People choose vegetarianism for a variety of reasons.",

    "..but a true vegetarian eats no meat at all, including chicken and fish.",
    "One thing I know is that when a woman decides to become a vegetarian,...",
    "...that might mean she wants to lose some weight, like my sister.",
