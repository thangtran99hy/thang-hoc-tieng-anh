    "Mi-na, here's what I have for you.",

    "Well, appearance is obviously the first thing I see,...",
    "...so the way he looks, maybe.",

    "...or the things he says, along with the vocabulary he uses.",
    "When people talk about their lives,...",

    "When it comes to careers, I don't value jobs like lawyers, doctors and professors.",
    "I want to know if he enjoys what he does and if he is good at it.",
    "This is what I value.",
    "It may sound easy, but finding such a path...",
    "...is what I consider the most important thing.",
    "Then, I would check on his relationships...",
    "...with his family members, siblings, friends and other people around him.",
    "What about you Alex?",
    "Are you more like a \"love at first sight\" kind of guy?",
    "I have to admit that I am somewhat a \"love at first sight\" kind of guy.",
    "I think what I really look for is how much she is willing to devote herself...",
    "...to our family, kids and their education and careers."
