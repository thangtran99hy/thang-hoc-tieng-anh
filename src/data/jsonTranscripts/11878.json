    "What is your biggest failure?",
    "My biggest failure came with Forest Products.",
    "I had lost a two-million-dollar account after being there only six weeks.",
    "And I felt awful and I thought I was gonna lose my job.",
    "But luckily that didn't happen because I was very determined to get that account back.",
    "And what I did was I researched what went wrong,...",
    "...addressed that with the clients, and within six months I got them back.",
    "I even grew it to be a bigger account...",
    "...and right now it makes up a third of the company's business.",
    "So, I feel like I definitely learned my lesson and I won't be making that mistake again."
