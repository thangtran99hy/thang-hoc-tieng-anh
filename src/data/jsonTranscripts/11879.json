    "Why display it in public?",
    "Why do you want to let everybody know that you're in love?",
    "I guess we don't see eye to eye on that subject.",
    "I am one of those girls who think it is such a sensitive and romantic way to express your love for your significant other.",
    "I think people should feel free to express themselves emotionally and physically...",
    "...without having to worry about what other people might think."
