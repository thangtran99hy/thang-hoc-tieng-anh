    "I Feel Good!",
    "Hey Yongchul, is that you?",
    "Oh my gosh, you look like a totally different person!",
    "I heard you have lost weight, but I didn't know how much.",
    "I'm impressed with what you've done!",
    "So, what's the secret?",
    "I mean, how can a person go from a plump little cutie to a muscular hunk in such a short period of time?",
    "Did you go on a diet?",
    "Or did you exercise?",
    "What is it?",
    "Come on, I want to know!",
    "Haha, Diane. Calm down.",
    "Well, let me tell you how I did it.",
    "Not that you need to lose weight or anything!",
    "I'm only telling because you asked me to.",
    "First, I've completely changed my diet.",
    "I didn't 'go on a diet', but basically changed my eating habits.",
    "Remember how I used to eat?",
    "I would skip breakfast, have a big lunch, a late dinner and desserts.",
    "That had taken a toll on my body.",
    "So, I took my doctor's advice and started eating three regular meals.",
    "The most important thing is, never miss breakfast!",
    "All in all, it's a good thing.",
    "Now, about the working out part."
