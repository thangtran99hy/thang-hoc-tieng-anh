    "...most likely stuck in traffic, trying to find a parking spot.",
    "So irritating.",
    "Another thing that drives me crazy is the fact that it is so expensive to live in a city.",
    "It costs a lot of money to get a place to live in...",

    "I have been living in Manhattan since 1993,...",
    "...but I think it's time to leave.",
    "I miss living in a small town where everybody knows everybody.",
    "Maybe I'm getting old, as my friends would say.",

    "Life is short and I deserve to be happy.",
    "I know I am happy in my hometown,...",
    "...so that's where I'll be going."
