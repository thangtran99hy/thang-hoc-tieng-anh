    "This morning, I read an interesting story about a two-year-old Indian girl...",
    "...born with four arms, four legs, and extra internal organs.",
    "And guess what?",
    "Doctors removed her extra limbs successfully!",
    "What a relief.",
    "And she will go back to her rural village...",
    "...where she had been revered by some...",
    "...as an incarnation of the four-armed Hindu goddess she was named after.",
    "Speaking of incarnation, do you believe in rebirth Alex?",
    "Have you thought about you being reborn as someone or something else?",
    "Although I don't believe in an afterlife,...",
    "...if I had the chance to be transmigrated,...",
    "...I'd want to be reborn as a female from a high-class family...",
    "...with a high-profile figure in my family, like a president.",
    "In that case, I would be super rich.",
    "Also, I'd want my parents to be from totally different countries or cultures...",
    "...like a mom from an Asian country and a dad from the west...",
    "...so I can have two perfect mother tongues.",
    "I don't want to look like a total Asian or Caucasian.",
    "What about you Mi-na?",
    "I'd want to be reborn as a Korean again.",
    "Hopefully, at that time,...",
    "...the country will be one of the most powerful nations in the world.",
    "I want my parents to be Korean too."
