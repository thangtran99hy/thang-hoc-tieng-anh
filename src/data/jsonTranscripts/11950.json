    "Last month, when I visited Taiwan for a business trip,...",
    "I went into this shop that sold music CDs,...",
    "...autographed goods, magazines and so on.",
    "Then I found items with \"BoA\",...",
    "...\"Rain\" and \"Super Junior's\" faces on them.",
    "I mean,...",
    "...I did see on TV that Korean popular culture is just sweeping across Asia,...",
    "...but after witnessing this with my own two eyes,...",
    "...I have to admit that Korea rocks.",
    "The trend has really given Korean stars fame...",
    "...and has done much to boost the image and prestige of Korean pop culture.",
    "But do you predict that this trend will last forever?",

    "I hope it can spread all over the world...",
    "...not just in Asia, you know.",
    "I'm also expecting more Korean pop artists to make it in the world!"
