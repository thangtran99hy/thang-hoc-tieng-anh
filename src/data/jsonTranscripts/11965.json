    "Secondhand Smoke - A Major Health Hazard.",
    "Winston, would you please put out that cigarette?",
    "I hate cigarette smoke!",
    "Besides, I'm sure you know how hazardous secondhand smoke is.",
    "If you care about me, please stop smoking while I'm around.",
    "Or, better yet, I think you should quit smoking cold turkey!",
    "You know I'm saying this for your own good.",
    "I see what you mean,...",
    "...but it's really hard for me to quit smoking now!",
    "I'm under a lot of stress these days...",
    "...and smoking is the only way to release the stress.",
    "I know I'm pathetic, but you're going to have to bear with me.",
    "About secondhand smoke, I see your point, Jaime,...",
    "...that it affects your health as much as it damages my health.",
    "But, as for me, I have to protest.",
    "Do you want me to go outside the building whenever I need a cigarette break?",
    "Then I'm going to have to leave my computer every half an hour.",
    "That's not productive!",
    "Plus, smoking helps me focus better.",
    "So, I suggest that you move your desk to another room for now!"
