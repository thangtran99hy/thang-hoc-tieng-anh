    "When did you start learning Korean?",

    "...but I found Chinese characters too complicated.",
    "And I don't know what happened with Japanese but,...",

    "...those Chinese characters look almost the same as the Japanese ones.",
    "But Korean letters don't have any resemblance to other Asian languages.",
    "True. In my case, I attempted to learn French once,...",
    "...since speaking French sounds and looks so noble,...",
    "...but couldn't keep it up.",

    "I didn't know anyone from France,...",
    "...didn't really have an interest in French culture.",
    "When learning a language you really need to have a great interest in that culture as well."
