    "Do you know where the nearest one is?",
    "Yes, there's one not too far from here.",
    "Is it walking distance?",
    "Well, I suppose so, but it'd be a bit of a long walk.",
    "How long?",
    "Maybe twenty minutes or so.",
    "I'd rather get there a bit faster than that.",
    "Is there another way?",
    "Sure, just hop on the bus at that bus stop across the street.",
    "Okay, which bus do I get?",
    "I think both number 15 and number 17 go there.",
    "They both come by every five minutes.",
    "Sounds easy! Where do I get off?",
    "Just tell the driver that you want to get off at Commercial Street."
