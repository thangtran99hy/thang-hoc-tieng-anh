    "Excuse me, I've never been to a laundromat before.",
    "I'm not sure what to do.",
    "Okay, no problem.",
    "What do you need to do?",
    "Just regular washing?",
    "Yes, I guess so.",
    " I just have regular clothes here.",
    "Okay, then it's pretty easy.",
    "You'll need to change about five dollars into quarters.",
    "Where can I do that?",
    "There's a coin changer right over here.",
    "Then what do I do?",
    "You'll need to get a small box of detergent.",
    "There is a vending machine that sells detergent next to the washing machines.",
    "Okay.",
    "So I guess I just put my clothes and the detergent in a washing machine.",
    "Yup, it's as simple as that.",
    "Let me know when you are done and I'll give you a hand with the dryers.",
    "Thank you very much."
