    "Welcome to Fitness Universe.",
    "Hi! Could you tell me a little bit about your membership fees?",
    "Are you interested in our one - year membership?",
    "I'm going to be here for a year, so I guess that would be the best one to start with.",
    "Okay. For a regular one - year membership,...",
    "...the cost is $1,000.",
    "Does that include use of all the facilities?",
    "Yes, that includes use of the swimming pool and racquetball courts.",
    "How about if I want a personal trainer?",
    "Then your best bet would be to get a Gold Star membership.",
    "With that, you get a personal trainer to work with you three times every week.",
    "I see. How much is a Gold Star membership?",
    "A Gold Star membership is $1,500 per year, sir.",
    "Hmm... I think I'll just stick with the regular membership."
