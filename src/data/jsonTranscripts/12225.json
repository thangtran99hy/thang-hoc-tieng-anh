    "I was invited to a big party this evening.",

    "I'm sure a lot of other people will show up as well.",
    "They said it's \"semiformal\". What does that mean, exactly?",

    "Okay. What about the shirt?",
    "You should have a collared shirt, but a tie isn't necessary.",
    "Right, I think I understand.",
    "Anything else I should know before I go?",
    "Yes, be sure to bring some sort of gift for the host or hostess.",
    "Such as?",
