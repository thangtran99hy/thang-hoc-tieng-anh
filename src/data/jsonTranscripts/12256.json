    "If you add in the two weekends, it's nine whole days!",

    "I imagine I will do something.",
    "It'd be nice to get away for a little while.",
    "You're telling me!",
    "I'm heading down to the coast for a few days.",
    "Sounds like you're going to hit the beach.",
    "Yup, but only for a part of it.",
    "I want to visit my cousin in Chicago,...",
    "...so I'm going to fly there and spend a few days with him.",
    "When was the last time you saw him?",
    "It's been over two years now.",
    "I guess it's time for a visit, then!",
    "Definitely!"
