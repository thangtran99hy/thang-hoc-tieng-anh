    "You're going to Jane's Halloween party, right?",
    "Yes, I am, but I don't know what to do about a costume.",
    "Don't you have a costume yet?",
    "No, I've never actually been to a Halloween party before.",
    "I see, well, not to worry, I will help you out.",
    "Great! What do you recommend I go as?",
    "Let's see, last year I went as a policeman.",
    "I think I still have my old costume.",
    "As a policeman?",
    "Is that legal?",
    "Of course it is!",
    "In fact, lots of people go as one.",
    "Well...",
    "Don't worry,...",
    "...as long as you don't pretend to be a real one on the street, everything is fine.",
    "Okay, so I'll just wear it at the party then.",
    "Exactly! And I think that it will fit you just right."
