    "You've been here for a long time and have always done a great job.",
    "More than that!",
    "Every time he asked me to stay late, or do extra work,...",
    "...I've always done it!",
    "Did you remind him of that?",
    "Of course! Do you think it did any good?",
    "I guess not. I'm really sorry."
