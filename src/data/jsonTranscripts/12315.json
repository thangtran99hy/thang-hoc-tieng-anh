    "Hey, did you take a look at the cover of this week's \"Celebrity Tattler\"?",
    "No, I don't usually read those Hollywood gossip magazines.",
    "Me neither, but I just had to pick this one up.",
    "Check it out!",
    "Let's see.",
    "Well, Brad Pitt is breaking up with a girlfriend and divorcing his wife.",
    "How interesting!",
    "No, not that. Look what it says at the bottom.",
    "You mean here?",
    "\"Entire Cast of Friends Takes a Holiday at a Nudist Colony.\"",
    "Yeah, isn't that amazing?",
    "Not really.",
    "Are people that bored with their own lives that they need to read about stuff like this?",
    "I guess so. You know, it's strange,...",
    "...I just felt like I had to buy the magazine when I saw it.",
    "One thing about TV and Movie stars,...",
    "...they're always getting themselves into some kind of trouble.",
    "That's very true."
