    "Did you see the football game last night?",
    "No, I missed it unfortunately,...",
    "...but I heard it was an amazing game.",
    "Was it ever!",
    "The Seahawks were down by four touchdowns in the last quarter,...",
    "...but came back to win it in overtime.",
    "Sounds like a thriller! I bet the fans were going crazy.",
    "The players said that they couldn't even hear themselves think on the field.",
    "So what happened exactly?",
    "Well, as I said, they were down by 28 points in the last quarter,...",
    "...but they just got on a roll and tied the game on the final play.",
    "Then it went into overtime?",
    "Yeah, and they got a field goal to win it in the first few minutes.",
    "Man, I'm sorry I missed it.",
    "That'll teach you to work late on a Monday night!",
    "I'll say!"
