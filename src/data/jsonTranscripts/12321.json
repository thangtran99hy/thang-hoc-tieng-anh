    "Have you decided who you're going to vote for?",
    "Man, you really want to drag it out of me, don't you?",
    "Well? Have you?",
    "Okay, fine! To be honest, I'm still undecided.",
    "But I do know that I think it's time for a change at the top.",
    "I see. Well, good news! I totally agree with you!",
    "Now hold on, I said I was still undecided."
