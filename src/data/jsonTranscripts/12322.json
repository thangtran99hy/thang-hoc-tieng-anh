    "That's true.",
    "I think the stock market hasn't been doing all that well of late.",
    "No, it hasn't.",
    "Both the NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange have been in the doldrums for a while now.",
    "I think that the government hasn't done a very good job of managing the economy, either.",
    "Well, it's all interconnected.",
