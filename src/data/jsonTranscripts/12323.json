    "Did you hear there's going to be a big anti-fur rally downtown today?",
    "Anti-fur rally? What is that all about?",
    "You know, people are against killing animals.",
    "Oh, well, I agree with that.",
    "Maybe I should go to the rally.",
    "Sure, why not?",
    "It's going to be in front of Blumenthal's Department Store.",
    "Blumenthal's? Why there?",
    "Because they just signed a multimillion dollar deal to import expensive rare...",
    "...furs from Russia.",
    "Oh, I see. Then I guess that's a good place to hold the rally.",
    "I heard even the mayor is going to be there.",
    "He's going to make a speech, too.",
    "He must feel very strongly about the issue.",
    "He does. He is well-known to be a strong environmentalist."
