    "Hi, my name is Anne Glass.",
    "I'm a reading and learning specialist at a private school in New York City.",
    "And I work with kindergarteners through third graders on reading, word study and writing skills.",
    "In addition to being a reading specialist and a learning specialist, I'm also a parent.",
    "And today, I'm going to talk to you about topics in reading.",
    "When I teach a reading lesson to young, emergent readers,...",
    "...my overarching goal is to make sure that they are successful.",
    "And that means that I have a very specific goal in mind...",
    "...and I keep my goals very manageable.",
    "I also don't keep the object of my lesson a secret.",
    "I want my student to know explicitly what we are working on,...",
    "...whether it's a phonic skill or a comprehension skill...",
    "We're going to make sure that we know from the start what the expectations are.",
    "I think across the board in reading instruction,...",
    "...it's really important to be explicit with our students...",
    "...about what the content of the lesson is and what the criteria for success are.",
    "It's also crucial to provide, as often as possible,...",
    "...multisensory methods for teaching early reading skills.",
    "To the extent that it's possible,...",
    "...you should always provide opportunities for visual, kinesthetic and auditory reinforcement...",
    "...when you're teaching a new concept.",
    "And the final thing is that I always want my students to feel successful at the end.",
    "Which means that if I'm asking them to read a text,...",
    "...I'm going to start with the pre review of every concept that they might encounter in the text.",
    "Whether they are sight words or phonics concepts,...",
    "...we're going to be prepared to encounter those concepts in the text and decode successfully with that information."
