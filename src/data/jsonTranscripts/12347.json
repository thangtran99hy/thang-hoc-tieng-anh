    "It flicks a towel on sexism's ass and kicks sand in the face of discrimination.",
    "It makes neck hair stand to attention.",
    "Hell, it's even been known to stop wars.",
    "That's a pretty impressive resume.",

    "...without wrecking our global playground in the process.",
    "We will do good with a vengeance.",
    "And to all the cynics and the naysayers,...",

    "...because like sport, we don't discriminate.",
    "We've made the world better,...",
    "...but we still want a better world."
