    "I sometimes go out and play basketball.",
    "When I don't feel like going out, I stay home and watch TV.",
    "How often do you play basketball?",
    "I sometimes play basketball with my friends.",
    "But I like to stay home and relax in front of the television most of the time.",
    "Yeah, I realized that many Koreans like watching TV very much.",
    "Yes, they do. Like my family, they watch TV all the time!",
    "How many hours a day do they watch TV?",
    "Well, basically, if they are at home, the TV is on.",
    "So I guess they watch TV at least six or seven hours a day.",
    "That seems like a lot."
