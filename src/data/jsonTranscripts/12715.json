    "What are your plans for the weekend, Changmin?",
    "Nothing much, really. I might meet up with a few of my Korean friends and have some drinks.",
    "How about you? What are you doing this weekend?",
    "I might go to church.",
    "Do you go to church every Sunday?",
    "Yes, most of the time.",
    "But I am going to visit my grandfather in two weeks, so I can't go to church then.",
    "Don't you usually go to church on Sundays?",
    "Actually, I am a Buddhist, so I don't really go to church services.",
    "A Buddhist? Wow, I think you're the first buddhist I've ever met!",
    "Well, there are a lot of Buddhists in Korea.",
    "I'm not sure, but I think about half of the population are Buddhists.",
    "I guess most Americans are Christians, right?",
    "You're right."
