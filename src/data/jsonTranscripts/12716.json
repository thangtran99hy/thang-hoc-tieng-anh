    "Hey guys! Good to see you both again. How was your weekend?",
    "Hi Changmin, I had a great time last weekend.",
    "I went on a camping trip by the lake with a bunch of my friends.",
    "That sounds like fun! I wish I did something like that.",
    "How come? What did you do, Kathy?",
    "Oh, I did nothing special. I just hung out here with some friends.",
    "We went out drinking on both Friday and Saturday nights.",
    "Well, sounds familiar. I went out drinking with my friends as well.",
    "I think I still have a hangover.",
    "Hey, that's not so bad guys. There's nothing wrong with meeting your friends for a few drinks.",
    "How much did you drink?",
    "I don't remember. I blacked out."
