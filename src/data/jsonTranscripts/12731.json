    "Hey Kathy, Changmin, how are you guys doing?",
    "Did you enjoy the holiday?",
    "Hi Susie. Yes, I had a great time. I recharged my batteries.",
    "Yes, I enjoyed the holiday, too, I guess, but I'm a bit tired.",
    "You don't sound very convincing there, and you look tired.",
    "Why didn't you take a rest during the weekend?",
    "I did rest.",
    "It's just that I had planned to get a lot of work done over the holiday,...",
    "...but I ended up doing nothing.",
    "What kind of work did you want to do?",
    "Well, I have a big project due for my computer science class.",
    "I see what you mean, but I don't think you should worry too much about it.",
    "Susie's right.",
    "I wish you had done it before, but there's still plenty of time left in this semester.",
    "Yes, but I really think I should have gotten more work done."
