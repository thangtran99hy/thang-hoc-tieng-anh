    "Hey, Changmin. Can you do me a favor?",
    "Sure, I'd be happy to. What's wrong?",
    "Well, I've been having a lot of trouble with my computer lately.",
    "I'm not very good with computers, so I don't really know what to do.",
    "I see. What is going wrong?",
    "It keeps shutting down whenever I open up a certain program.",
    "Uh-oh. That doesn't sound very good. You might have a virus.",
    "Have you had your computer checked for viruses?",
    "Viruses? No, I haven't. Would you mind checking my computer for viruses?",
    "Sure, I have a program on a disk that will help.",
    "Why don't I go home and get it,...",
    "...then we can meet up and try using it on your computer?",
    "That sounds great, Changmin. I really appreciate your help!",
    "I owe you big."
