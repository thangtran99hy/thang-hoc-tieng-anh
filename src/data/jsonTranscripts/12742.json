    "Hello, Kathy? This is Changmin.",
    "Changmin! Hey, are you all right? You sound terrible!",
    "I think I'm coming down with something. That's why I called you.",
    "Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that. What's wrong?",
    "I'm not sure. I've had a terrible headache all day.",
    "Really? Did you take any painkillers?",
    "Yes, but I don't think they're working.",
    "Anyway, we're supposed to meet today to go to the museum,...",
    "...but I'm afraid I can't make it.",
    "Can we postpone our meeting to tomorrow?",
    "Please Changmin, take care first. We can meet up some other time, then.",
    "I'm sorry that you don't feel well and I hope that you get better soon.",
    "Sorry, Kathy. It won't happen again."
