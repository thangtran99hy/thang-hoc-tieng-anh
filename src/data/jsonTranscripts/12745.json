    "Well guys, next week is the final exam week.",
    "I hope you both ace all of your tests!",
    "I definitely studied a lot, but I'm not so sure that I'm ready for them.",
    "Me, too. I'm really nervous.",
    "If I don't do well, my family will be very disappointed in me.",
    "Don't worry. I'm sure you'll do well on your tests.",
    "Any tips that you'd like to give us?",
    "Well, be sure to review all the material you studied in class and you'll be all set!",
    "I hope you pass the final exam.",
    "It's easier said than done.",
    "I think I have to cram for all of my tests.",
    "I bet you'll do fine.",
    "Cheer up!",
    "Why don't we all go out together after the exams and have a few drinks?",
    "It's on me!",
    "I'm in!",
    "Me, too!"
