    "Changmin, I didn't catch what the professor said just now.",
    "Can you explain that to me?",
    "OK. What didn't you understand?",
    "The part about the plates in the Earth and how they can cause volcanoes.",
    "Sure, I'd be happy to.",
    "The Earth is made up of a series of plates and where the plates meet,...",
    "...they sometimes push against each other.",
    "Right, I see.",
    "Sometimes that causes mountains to form,...",
    "...and it can also cause volcanoes to occur.",
    "What do you mean?",
    "Are you saying it's basically the pressure that causes some volcanoes to erupt?",
    "Yes, exactly.",
    "Okay, I get it now. Thanks so much, Changmin. You're a big help!",
    "No problem at all."
