    "Thank you so much for coming with me, Kathy.",
    "Oh, no problem.",
    "I love shopping, even if it's just window-shopping.",
    "So, shall we take a look at some of the options?",
    "OK.",
    "Wow, those are pretty notebooks.",
    "Can I get $10 worth of these?",
    "Sure, do you need anything else?",
    "Actually, yes.",
    "Can you recommend a good MP3 player?",
    "Sure, we have quite a few good ones here.",
    "This is our most popular model.",
    "That one looks really nice.",
    "How much is it?",
    "This one sells for $200.",
    "It's a top-of-the-line model, so it's more expensive than the others.",
    "$200!",
    "That seems expensive!",
    "Yeah, that's out of my price range.",
    "Can you give me a discount?"
