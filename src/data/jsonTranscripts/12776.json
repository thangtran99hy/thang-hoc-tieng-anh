    "Hey Susie, I can't wait to show you the new dress I bought.",
    "Wow, you bought a new dress today? Yeah, let's see it.",
    "What do you think? I just love this color.",
    "Yes, the color is great.",
    "Why don't you put it on, so I can see how it looks on you?",
    "Okay, good idea.",
    "Oh, no! This is terrible! It doesn't fit me right at all.",
    "Really? Let's see. Oh, yeah, you're right.",
    " It looks a little bit big on you.",
    "I feel like I'm wearing a tent! This is no good at all.",
    "I think she gave me the wrong size again. This is the third time she's done that.",
    "I can't stand it anymore.",
    "Well, stop complaining, and just go back to the store and exchange it for a smaller size."
