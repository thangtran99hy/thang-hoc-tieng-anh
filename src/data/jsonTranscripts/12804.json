    "I'm sorry to bother you, but could you tell me how to get to the Citibank?",
    "Yes, no problem.",
    "There's a Citibank branch not too far from here.",
    "How long does it take to get to the bank?",
    "It's about 5 minutes walking.",
    "Do you see the department store up ahead one block?",
    "Yes, on the right side, right?",
    "Yes, that's it, just go past the department store and take your first right.",
    "Okay, take a right after the department store?",
    "Yes, then go straight about a block and a half...",
    "...and you'll see Citibank on your left.",
    "It's next to a sporting goods store.",
    "You can't miss it!",
    "Thank you very much for your help!"
