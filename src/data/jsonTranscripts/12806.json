    "Changmin, are you feeling okay today?",
    "To be honest with you, I'm not feeling very well at all.",
    "What's wrong?",
    "I'm not exactly sure.",
    "My throat's been killing me for a couple days and I think I have a fever.",
    "Have you been able to eat at all?",
    "Yes, a little bit, but it really hurts when I swallow.",
    "Something is definitely wrong with my throat.",
    "I think you're right. Why don't you go to the hospital?",
    "I was kind of hoping that I would feel better.",
    "I think you must see a doctor.",
    "But isn't it expensive to see a doctor here?",
    "Not if you are a student.",
    "Changmin, shall we take a break? I think you need a break."
