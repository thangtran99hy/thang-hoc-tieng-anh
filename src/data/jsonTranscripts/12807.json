    "Hello there. What seems to be the problem today?",
    "Hello, doctor. My throat has been sore for two days.",
    "I see. Do you have a fever as well?",
    "I think so, but I haven't actually taken my temperature.",
    "Have you been able to eat okay?",
    "Are you having any stomach problems?",
    "No, my stomach feels fine now, but I had a stomachache yesterday.",
    "Right. Let me take a look at your throat.",
    "Open up and say \"aahhhh\" please.",
    "\"Aaahhhh.\" Ouch!",
    "Yes, your throat isn't doing so well.",
    "But don't worry, I will give you some medicine to make it better.",
    "Thank you, doctor. I'm feeling much better already."
