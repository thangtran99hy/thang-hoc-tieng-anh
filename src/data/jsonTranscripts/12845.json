    "Hey, what's up baby sister? How are your classes going?",
    "They're going pretty well. I'm still on schedule to graduate next year.",
    "That's good to hear.",
    "You know, Sherry, I'm sorry to ask you this, but I'm really short of money these days.",
    "Oh? Do you need to borrow some?",
    "Yes, can I borrow some money from you?",
    "Sure, are you still planning to work during the summer break?",
    "Yes, so I can pay you back as soon as I get my first paycheck.",
    "Okay, sounds good. Pay me back after your first check.",
    "How much do you need?"
