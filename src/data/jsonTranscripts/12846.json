    "This is a really nice place you have, Kathy.",
    "Yes, I really love the way you've decorated it, too.",
    "Thanks guys. I'm glad you like it here.",
    "I hope you can come visit me more often.",
    "You can count on it!",
    "Oops! Oh no! I just dropped my glass on your table.",
    "I'm terribly sorry Kathy.",
    "Hey, don't worry about it. No big deal.",
    "Okay. Uh, Kathy. I hate to tell you this,...",
    "...but I think the glass scratched the table a bit when it fell on it.",
    "I'd like to apologize to you for my mistake.",
    "Oh, that's just a tiny little scratch.",
    "Oh, I'm so sorry. I will pay to get it fixed.",
    "It won't happen again.",
    "No, it's not even worth worrying about.",
    "It's not really your fault, since the glass was slippery."
