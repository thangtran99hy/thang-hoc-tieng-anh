    "...to deliver a vaccine to end ultraviolet fever.",
    "Captain, we're picking up something on the long-range sensors.",
    "Spek, what is it?",

    "Bring up the view screen! It's too distant to make out.",
    "The brightness, the energy. Whoa!",
    "Captain.",
    "What is it, Lieutenant Orula?",
    "I'm receiving a transmission from a Klingie ship.",
    "The Klingie's have a saying, Captain,...",
    "...\"If you cannot control yourself, you cannot command others.\"",
    "He looks like he's beaming aboard.",
    "Mr. Scootie, how much time do you require to repair the warp drive?",

    "I'd rather beam up a tribulator, if it's all the same to you.",

    "Aye aye, Captain!",
    "It's too late, Captain.",
    "Typical Federation, not to have your defenses ready.",
    "What do you want from us?",
    "Only your certain doom!"
