    "Chapter Eight, American English or Not English but Somewhere in the Ballpark.",
    "From the moment Brits first landed in America,...",
    "...they needed names for all the new plants and animals...",
    "...so they borrowed words like \"raccoons\", \"squash\" and \"moose\" from the Native Americans...",
    "...as well as most of their territory.",
    "Waves of immigrants fed America's hunger for words.",
    "The Dutch came sharing coleslaw and cookies...",
    "...probably as a result of their relaxed attitude to drugs.",
    "Later, the Germans arrived selling pretzels from delicatessens.",
    "And the Italians arrived with their pizza, their pasta...",
    "...and their Mafia, just like mama used to make.",
    "America spread a new language of capitalism,...",
    "...getting everyone worried about the break-even on the bottom line...",
    "...whether they were blue chip or white-collar.",
    "The commuter needed a whole new system of freeways, subways and parking lots...",
    "... and quickly before words like \"merger\" and \"downsizing\" could be invented.",
    "American English drifted back across the pond...",
    "...as Brits got the hang of their cool movies and their groovy jazz.",
    "There are even some old forgotten English words that lived on in America...",
    "...so they carried on using fall, faucets, diapers and candy...",
    "...while the Brits moved on to autumn, taps, nappies and NHS dental care."
