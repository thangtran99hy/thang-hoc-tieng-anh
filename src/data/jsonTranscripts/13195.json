    "Long ago, the lion went hunting along with fox, jackal and wolf.",
    "They made a promise that the spoil should be divided equally.",
    "They found a stag and killed it so they could eat it.",
    "The lion, because he was the king of beasts, said he should have it all.",
    "The others dared not challenge the lion.",
    "So they left, saying...",
    "...'The lion was willing to work with others but would not share the reward.'"
