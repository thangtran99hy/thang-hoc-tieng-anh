    "A fox was strolling through an orchard.",
    "He saw some grapes ripening on a vine.",
    "He thought the grapes would take away his thirst.",
    "The vine was very high so he jumped up, but he could not reach the grapes.",
    "Turning round again with a One, Two, Three, he jumped up, but with no luck.",
    "Again and again he tried.",
    "But at last he had to give it up and walked away,...",
    "...saying that the grapes were probably too sour."
