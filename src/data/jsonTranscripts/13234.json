    "A lonely, young shepherd boy tended his sheep near a forest.",
    "One day, he shouted \"Wolf, Wolf,\" and the villagers ran to help him.",
    "There was no wolf, but he enjoyed their company.",
    "He tried the same thing again later.",
    "Once again, the villagers came to help, in vain.",
    "But then a wolf really did attack his sheep.",
    "He cried \"Wolf, Wolf,\"...",
    "...but no one came to help.",
    "The villagers thought they were being fooled again.",
    "The wolf made a good meal of the flock."
