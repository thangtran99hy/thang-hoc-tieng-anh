    "There once was a family of bears; mama bear,...",
    "...papa bear, and baby bear.",
    "One day, when they weren't at home,...",
    "...a little girl named Goldilocks went inside.",
    "She tried eating their porridge on the table.",
    "The baby bear's tasted just right, so she ate it all up.",
    "Then, she went into the next room and found their beds.",
    "The big bed was too hard, the medium-sized bed was too soft,...",
    "...but the little bed was just right.",
    "She fell asleep in the baby bear's bed.",
    "Just then, the three bears came home to find their house in a mess.",
    "When she awoke, Goldilocks saw them and ran away."
