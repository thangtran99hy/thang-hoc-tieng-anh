    "A farmer once owned a goose.",
    "One day, he went to get the egg his goose laid.",
    "When he took it up, it was as heavy as lead.",
    "So he was going to throw it away.",
    "But he took it home on second thought.",
    "To his delight, he found that it was an egg of pure gold.",
    "Every day there was a new golden egg.",
    "He soon became rich by selling his eggs.",
    "He got greedy and decided to kill the goose to get all the gold.",
    "He killed it, cut it open and found nothing."
