    "One day, a thought occurred to the members of the body:...",
    "...'We were doing all the work and the belly was enjoying all the food.'",
    "So they held a meeting.",
    "After a long discussion, they decided to go on strike...",
    "...until the belly agreed to do its share of the work.",
    "The hands refused to take the food,...",
    "...the mouth refused to receive it,...",
    "...and the teeth had no work to do.",
    "Soon, they found that they were not active.",
    "They could not do their jobs properly.",
    "They realized that even the belly in its dull,...",
    "...quiet way was doing necessary work for the body.",
    "Thus, they agreed that they all had to work together."
