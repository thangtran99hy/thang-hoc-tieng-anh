    "A horse and an ass were travelling together.",
    "The ass carried a heavy load on its back.",
    "\"I wish I were you,\" sighed the ass.",
    "The ass wanted to be like the horse because it had no load.",
    "Next day, however, there was a great battle, and the horse was fatally wounded.",
    "The ass was happy not to be the horse after all."
