    "A duckling hatched in the barnyard.",
    "It was too grey, too large and too clumsy.",
    "The other animals mistreated him, so he left.",
    "Almost a year later, he saw some beautiful swans in a pond.",
    "He was afraid to approach them.",
    "But to his surprise, they welcomed and accepted him.",
    "He gazed at his reflection...",
    "...and saw that he too was a beautiful swan."
