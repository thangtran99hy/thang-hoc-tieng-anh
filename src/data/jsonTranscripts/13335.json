    "Almost anyone knows how to play tic-tac-toe...",
    "...but not everyone knows the strategy that guarantees they'll never lose another game.",
    "You will need: an opponent, a pencil or pen and paper.",
    "Step 1: Draw your tic-tac-toe board on a piece of paper using a pen or a pencil.",
    "It should have nine squares total, with three at the top,...",
    "...three in the middle, and three on the bottom.",
    "Step 2: Whether you are flipping a coin or throwing dice,...",
    "...you need to win the right to the first move if you don't want to lose the game.",
    "Step 3: Mark the center square with an \"X\" or an \"O\".",
    "This is the key to guaranteeing...",
    "...you'll never lose in tic-tac-toe when you have the first move.",
    "Following this rule will not guarantee you a win.",
    "It will guarantee that, even against a tic-tac-toe master, you will never lose.",
    "Step 4: After an opponent makes their mark,...",
    "...look to see if there is a square to the right of it available.",
    "If so, take it with your next move.",
    "Step 5: If the square to the right isn't available,...",
    "...take the square to the left with your next move.",
    "Step 6: If the squares to the right and left are taken,...",
    "...place your next mark above their last mark.",
    "Step 7: If the squares to the right and left...",
    "...and above your opponent's last move are taken,...",
    "...choose the square below it.",
    "Step 8: Repeat the right - left - above - and - below rule for each move you play.",
    "Congratulations!",
    "You may not win but you'll never be a loser.",
    "Did you know?",
    "In the movie \"WarGames\", war is averted when the computer is shown...",
    "...that nuclear war, like tic-tac-toe, cannot be won."
