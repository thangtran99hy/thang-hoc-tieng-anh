    "How do you let people have a moment of seeing something...",
    "...deeply familiar from a really different perspective?",
    "How do you create the moment when someone can see something for the first time?",
    "And curiosity is about what you can make people...",

    "I think curiosity is not just about observing things, it's about being changed by them."
