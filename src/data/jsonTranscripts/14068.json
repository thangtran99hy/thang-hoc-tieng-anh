    "You might not have my name but you have my blood.",
    "Honor! You think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear!",

    "You kill me, your brother is a dead man.",
    "Stop this madness in the name of your king!",
    "I'll kill the whole bloody lot of them until you and I are the only people left in this world."
