    "Why Miki?",

    "She has soul, a deep soul...",
    "Right.",
    "...and I was looking for another opportunity to work with her.",
    "And so I'm writing a script now where she has a part in that.",

    "...so she also carries a very traditional Japanese culture.",
    "So in my mind, I think she's just perfect."
