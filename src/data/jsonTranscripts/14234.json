    "So we're here with Michael who took a series of photos in the days after September 11th.",
    "He captured a street - level view of downtown Manhattan.",
    "Michael, why don't you get us started?",
    "Yeah, we were driving into Manhattan and you could see the skyline...",
    "...as you drove over the bridge and some planes in the sky still but the towers were missing.",
    "And as you get into Manhattan from Penn Station, you could see the flags were at half-staff and...",
    "...and now you're actually walking the Ground Zero.",
    "Right. From Penn Station, there are people selling flags on the street...",
    "...and missing posters all over the place reminding you what had happened.",
    "Now there's so much visual stimuli, how do you just keep it straight?",
    "Yeah, you know, it was hard to process even from the streets of the city being empty,...",
    "...it was hard to process because usually there's just people everywhere.",
    "They had state troopers searching cars as they went below the 14th street cut off.",
    "You could still see the smoke coming from the towers also as you go by Chelsea Piers...",
    "...where they had a lot of the ambulances staged in case they needed rescue services.",
    "And what was it like seeing all the service vehicles and the TV crews and...?",
    "Yeah, I mean, just an incredible amount of authority, the military,...",
    "...the state police, the city police, secret service,...",
    "...DEA, FBI, all  agencies were there along with all the media,...",
    "...as you'll see as we get closer to Ground Zero.",
    "And what was it like seeing people in masks still?",
    "Well, you know, as the dump trucks came out of the Ground Zero with...",
    "...the steel girders from the towers, you could smell sulfur in the air and...",
    "...people were handing out water to the rescuers...",
    "...and some of the rescue vehicles that were crushed in the attacks were brought out...",
    "...and escorted by military police as people had clapped and sort of cheered for those people."
