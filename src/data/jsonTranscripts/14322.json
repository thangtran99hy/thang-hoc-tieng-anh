    "Hi I'm Marc Bauer from the French Culinary Institute.",
    "I'm gonna show you how to separate eggs.",
    "That means I'm gonna separate the whites from the yolk.",
    "First, I crack the egg on the side of a bowl or on a cutting board...",
    "...and I separate with my thumbs into two shells.",
    "Of course, I have a bowl below and the egg white falls into it.",
    "Go back and forth until everything is separated.",
    "In case you get a little egg shell, either in the white or the yolk,...",
    "...you can separate it with a spoon...",
    "...or you can let them sit for a while, especially in the egg whites...",
    "...and the shell will fall to the bottom.",
    "Just make sure you don't pour it into the final product. ",
    "That's how you separate eggs. "
