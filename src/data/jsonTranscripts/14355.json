    "Baby birds sometimes fall from their nests,...",
    "...and sometimes are knocked out by storms or other natural causes.",
    "If you find a baby bird, here's how to feed it.",
    "You will need: a container, a heating pad, dog kibble, hot sugar water,...",
    "...a bowl, a spoon, hard-boiled eggs, baby cereal, toothpicks, canned cat or dog food, lean raw beef and fruit.",
    "Step 1 : Place the baby bird in a container on top of a heating pad to keep it warm.",
    "Handle the bird only when necessary.",
    "Step 2 : Prepare the food by soaking dog kibble in hot sugar water for one hour.",
    "Step 3 : Remove the kibble from the water and mix it with baby cereal and a hard-boiled egg.",
    "Feed the baby bird with this mixture for the first couple of days.",
    "Step 4 : Make a pea - size ball with the food mixture and place it in the baby's mouth using a toothpick.",
    "Never force food or water into the bird's mouth.",
    "Step 5 : Feed the bird every 15 minutes over the first couple of days.",
    "When it's stronger, feed it every 30 to 60 minutes.",
    "Step 6 : Feed the baby bird room temperature canned dog food, lean raw beef and fruit after the first couple of days.",
