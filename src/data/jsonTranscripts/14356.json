    "This morning, I got up and got ready quickly because I have to get a lot of stuff done.",
    "I sat down at my desk to start getting my stuff done...",
    "...and I spilled my coffee so I got a sponge to clean it up.",
    "And I figured I'd take an extra minute to clean the whole desk...",
    "...because a clean desk would help me get my stuff done.",
    "When I was finished, I realized I hadn't eaten anything...",
    "...and I didn't wanna be hungry while I got my stuff done.",
    "So I went into the kitchen and I was out of cereal.",
    "When I got into the grocery store, I remembered a bunch of other crap I needed to get.",
    "And I figured I was already there so I did my shopping for the week...",
    "...so I didn't have to worry about it while I got my stuff done.",
    "When I got home, I didn't feel like cereal anymore and so I made an omelet...",
    "...and I did the dishes so I wouldn't have to do them after I got my stuff done.",
    "And then I went out to get some oil from the hardware store...",
    "...because my desk chair is kind of squeaky...",
    "...and I didn't want to be distracted by a squeaky chair while I got my stuff done.",
    "When I got back it was getting kind of late...",
    "...and I knew I wouldn't be able to get my stuff done today...",
    "...so I started watching the Twilight Zone marathon on TV.",
    "I just have to make sure I get to bed early because I want to be well rested tomorrow...",
    "...so I can get my stuff done."
