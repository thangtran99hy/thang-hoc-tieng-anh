    "His home lies on the migration routes of several species.",
    "The black-chinned is the most common.",
    "In spring, they travel up from Mexico on their way to nest as far north...",
    "...as Montana and British Columbia.",
    "Then in autumn,...",
    "...he sees them again on their way back to their winter quarters in the warmth of the south.",
    "Some of them have been fitted with leg rings so he knows that the same birds visit him...",
    "...each year to drink from the same feeder.",
    "It's possible that many now vary their routes...",
    "...to make sure they pay a call at such a reliable restaurant.",
    "At the height of the migration, he may be visited in a single day by about 9,000 different birds.",
    "And every day he provides his customers with over 13 gallons of sugar water.",
    "Meals like this must surely make the difference...",
    "... between life and death for many of the little Rufous hummingbirds...",
    "...which on leaving Jessie's fuel station, have still to tackle the last stage of their 2,000 mile migration...",
