    "So, this is what we've given up for cheap food and so...",
    "...the only way we can get back to that really is to basically integrate externalities.",
    "So that whether it's our energy producers, our food producers...",
    "...or with any other producers really have to pay full cost, full freight.",
    "In other words, if they do something and it has to...",
    "...result in expense at some other time, place or person;...",
    "...they have to integrate that into their prices...",
    "...so the pricing costs are integrated.",
    "Once price and costs are integrated, then you have real feedback.",
    "And feedback then allows people to make intelligent decisions.",
    "But without feedback, it's like garbage in, garbage out.",
    "So when you get very cheap food, basically you're getting wrong information.",
    "And as I think many of you know,...",
    "...or at least you have an agricultural background some of you.",
    "I mean, herbicides don't kill by poisoning a plant;...",
    "...they kill by making it grow too fast, right?",
    "So, what we have in this economy basically is cheapness...",
    "...that allows us to buy a lot and grow too fast.",
    "And that's a sure way how to kill a culture and so less truly is more.",
    "And when food actually reflects its true cost, so forth what happens is...",
    "...we become more discriminatory; we do buy locally and the...",
    "...other thing that's driven low food prices is actually cheap energy.",
    "And really it was cheap energy that allowed...",
    "...whether it's beer companies or bread companies or all the others...",
    "...to centralize into huge, huge manufacturing facilities...",
    "...and then ship it all across the country in trucks.",
    "And that is reversing and changing slowly; not slowly enough in my opinion...",
    "...but in fact, cheap energy is gone; peak oil and peak production is here.",
    "I was with the Saudi Minister on Monday in Los Angeles, you know...",
    "...and they know it and their city own 25% of the world's oil; they know it.",
    "They're shifting their whole economy away from oil to energy to renewable energy.",
    "This is Saudis and we're still saying, \"Drill baby, drill.\"",
    "And if anybody should understand where we are with oil,...",
    "...it's gonna be the Saudis. And so the day of expensive oil is...",
    "...coming which means that it's going to reverse the sort of economies of scale.",
    "But I don't think there ever was an economy of scale; actually, I don't think there is.",
    "I think at a certain point you get these economies but again they're covered up by externalities.",
    "And so I think the people who are localizing production and localizing...",
    "...food webs and so forth are going to actually be buoyed up over the next five, ten and onward...",
    "...in years because of the shift in the price of energy...",
    "...and they're gonna have a competitive advantage instead of a competitive disadvantage."
