    "The terrible drought in Texas almost cost a puppy his life.",
    "This little fellow disappeared down a crack in the earth caused by dry weather.",
    "That's when heroes from the Animal Services in suburban Dallas went to work.",
    "They had to be careful to keep the dirt from caving in on top of the puppy.",
    "Oh, listen to his little cries!",
    "After 20 minutes and a lot of whimpering, the dog was pulled free.",
    "I'm so happy to see that.",
    "Nice work by those guys. Nice work!"
