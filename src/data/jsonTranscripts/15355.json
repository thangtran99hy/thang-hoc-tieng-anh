    "...what we saw was they weren't paying any attention to all those steps at all.",
    "They were taking every shortcut in the book, figuring they could get it close enough.",
    "Why do they do that? Well, most of them are paid based on piecework.",
    "So, faster is better and close enough is good enough...",
