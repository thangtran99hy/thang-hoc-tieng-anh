    "I've had good relationships.",
    "I've lived through good,...",
    "...I've lived through bad.",

    "So, the writing is a lot more personal.",
    "And so that's probably the biggest change is lyrically, I think...",
    "...I have more personal connection now to the songs...",
    "...that I write and I did that."
