    "How do we measure this?",
    "Well, we can look at a comparative analysis;...",
    "...that is, how the particular bank compares with other banks,..",

    "...the statement of financial position is arguably the document...",
    "...for understanding the state of the bank's finances.",

    "Then I'll briefly go over the categories included in a statement of financial position.",
    "I'll start with assets followed by liabilities.",
    "After that, I'll look at equity.",
    "Finally, I'll talk briefly about the statement of financial performance.",
