    "...such as unemployed and retired people, to provide a good balance.",
    "Let us go back to the role of the jury.",
    "In a trial, the jury's function is to decide on the facts of the case.",

    "However, many cases have a highly emotive element...",
    "...and this can, it is argued, sway the jury away from the facts.",
    "Should emotion have a place in a court of law?",
    "Can a group of twelve ordinary men and women provide a fair trial...",
    "...and reach the correct verdict any better or worse than trained lawyers?",

    "This, I think, is because we have an adversarial system...",
    "...where lawyers need to argue the case against each other."
