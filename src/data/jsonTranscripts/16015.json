    "There are situations when it's hard to know what to say...",

    "Cliche and boring as it may sound, this is why \"the weather\" is such a common starter.",

    "...but think about it: You are telling the other person that you are not invading their privacy...",
    "...and because you are talking about something fairly irrelevant,...",
    "...you are testing the other person to see if he wants to get to know you better."
