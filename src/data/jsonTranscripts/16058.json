    "Amanda.",
    "Amanda, how are you doing?",
    "I just want to ask you a question, Amanda.",
    "Yeah.",
    "When I put this over my head, what does that immediately remind you of?",
    "A bank robber?",
    "A bank robber, exactly.",
    "Everyone always says bank robber.",
    "And I reckon that's really discriminatory.",
    "Because I think wearing a stocking on your head like this is actually a really good look.",
    "And lately I've taken to wearing one, you know, just as a bit of a fashion statement.",
    "And everywhere I go, you wouldn't believe, I get nothing but prejudice.",
    "Hey there, just the paper and some chewing mints.",
    "You take off your mask.",

    "Take it off, sorry.",
    "No, you are a robber.",
    "You're gonna rob me.",
    "No, no I just wanna get some noodles.",
    "It's all gone.",
    "I just want some dumplings. No!",
    "Hi there. I noticed a DVD...",
    "No, the DVD in the window. Is that the final price you can offer?",
    "No, don't panic, no.",
    "I just wanna buy a DVD.",
    "Leave this center, or I will call the police.",
    "No, it's fine, no, no, no!",
    "It's just what I wear.",
    "Can you help me please?",
    "Don't call the police!",
    "I'm just a regular shopper.",
    "I think we got to get out of here.",
    "We got cops coming."
