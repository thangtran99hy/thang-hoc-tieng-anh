    "Hello! My name is Rabbi Eli Levitansky and this is Mahalo.com.",
    "Today we're gonna be discussing Hanukkah.",
    "Let's talk about what is Hanukkah.",
    "Hanukkah is the holiday of lights, which began over 2100 years ago...",
    "...when the Greek empire took over Israel.",
    "They forbade the Jewish people from observing the laws of the Torah...",
    "...and many of the Jews were driven out of Israel.",
    "There was a band of Jewish people called the Hashmonaim...",
    "...that got together and fought against the huge Greek army,...",
    "...overcame them and went back to Jerusalem to the temple where they restored everything in the temple.",
    "When they were in the temple, they wanted to light the menorah.",
    "But they did not have pure olive oil, which they needed to light it.",
    "They searched and searched and found one small jug, and that was enough to last them one day.",
    "It lasted miraculously for eight days.",
    "Which is why we have the holiday of Hanukkah for eight days,...",
    "..and each night we light a menorah, symbolizing the miracle that happened at that time.",
    "Thank you for watching! My name is Rabbi Eli Levitansky and this is Mahalo.com.",
