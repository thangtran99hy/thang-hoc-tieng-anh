    "What has Massachusetts given us?",
    "A liberal governor who wanted us to believe he is strong on defense.",
    "A liberal senator who wanted us to believe he was a man of the people.",
    "And a Massachusetts moderate who runs away from Ronald Reagan.",
    "Look, I was an Independent during the time of Reagan-Bush.",
    "I'm not trying to return to Reagan-Bush.",
    "Romney donated to Democrats...",
    "...and given the choice to vote in the Democrat or Republican primary,...",
    "...Romney chose the Democrats,...",
    "...voting for a liberal Democrat instead of President George H. W. Bush.",
    "Romney opposed the contract with America, raised taxes...",
    "...and authored government mandated health care with taxpayer-funded abortions.",
    "But now he tells us, \"Trust me, I'm a conservative\".",
    "Massachusetts moderate Mitt Romney: he'll say anything to win.",
    "Anything.",
    "And just like John Kerry, he speaks French too.",
    "But he's still a Massachusetts moderate.",
    "And a Massachusetts moderate cannot beat Barack Obama."
