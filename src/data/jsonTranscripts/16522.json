    "You wanna become a risk taker. You wanna raise the bar on yourself.",
    "Most people won't do that.",
    "See most people engage in low-life living, low-risk living.",
    "This God said if you're not willing to risk, you cannot grow.",
    "And if you cannot grow, you cannot become your best.",
    "And if you cannot become your best, you can't be happy.",
    "And if you can't be happy, then what else is there?"
