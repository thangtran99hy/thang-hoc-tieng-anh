    "Don't worry if your resume looks like you've bopped around a lot especially if you're a free agent who's a serial monogamist when it comes to clients.",
    "The reason that you became a free agent is that you're too smart to hold on a regular job.",
    "What matters most to prospective clients and customers is whether you can solve their problem.",
    "If you've got a long list of previous clients for whom you've done terrific work,...",
    "...that's actually better than ten years of dutiful service to a single employer.",
    "The world of work today doesn't give out any prizes for lifetime service. It's much more demanding than that.",
    "It's always asking, \"What have you done for me lately?\"",
    "It rewards the ability to think creatively, to come up with new solutions, to deliver great value and service...",
    "...and even to give the world something it didn't know it was missing."
