    "Hi, guys. In this section of the DVD, we'll spotlight some of the kicks and techniques featured in the film...",
    "...and we'll recreate them in a sparring environment.",
    "I have with me two stuntmen from \"The Rebel\" to help us recreate that.",
    "You might remember this first technique from the very first action scene.",
    "Let me walk you through another perspective of it.",
    "So in a sparring environment, when my partner will attack, kick, knee or punch,...",
    "...I like to sting him up a little bit...",
    "...and create distance before I throw the knockout blow.",
    "So, now here it is again in real speed.",
    "This next kick was featured in the final battle between my character and the villain.",
    "I came up with this technique because one of my favorite kicks is the axe kick.",
    "Let me demonstrate.",
    "It's really difficult to defend against this technique because of the downward action.",
    "And we're more used to defending or fending off strikes that are coming straight forward from the side or from the bottom.",
    "The problem with the axe kick is that it doesn't deliver much power and is more used as a defensive technique.",
    "So, for \"The Rebel\" I came up with the technique that throws my whole body weight into it.",
    "And it can also be used as an offensive weapon.",
    "Let us demonstrate in full speed."
