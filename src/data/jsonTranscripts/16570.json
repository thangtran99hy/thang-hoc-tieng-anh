    "Number One: Achilles and the Tortoise.",
    "How could a humble tortoise beat the legendary Greek hero Achilles in a race?",
    "The Greek philosopher Xeno liked the challenge and came up with this paradox.",
    "First, the tortoise is given a slight head start.",
    "Anyone fancying a flutter would still rush to put their money on Achilles.",
    "But Xeno pointed out that to overtake him,...",
    "...Achilles would first have to cover the distance...",
    "...to the point where the tortoise began.",
    "In that time, the tortoise would have moved...",
    "... so Achilles would have to cover that distance...",
    "...giving the tortoise time to amble forward a bit more.",
    "Logically, this would carry on forever.",
    "However small the gap between them,...",
    "...the tortoise would still be able to move forward while Achilles was catching up,...",
    "...meaning that Achilles could never overtake.",
    "Taken to an extreme, this bizarre paradox suggests that all movement is impossible.",
    "But it did lead to a realization...",
    "...that something finite can be divided an infinite number of times.",
    "This concept of an infinite series is used in finance to work out mortgage payments...",
    "...which is why they take an infinite amount of time to pay off."
