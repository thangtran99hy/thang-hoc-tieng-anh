    "Arrietty, make sure you hold on tight.",
    "Papa, did you see that?",
    "That's my girl.",
    "My mother, father, and I are all borrowers.",
    "Promise you won't let our daughter get eaten, or squashed like a bug.",
    "We borrow things like soap, and cookies, and sugar; things that humans don't miss if they're gone.",
    "We've been seen, and borrowers aren't supposed to be seen.",
    "No, wait.",
    "Don't go.",
    "The boy knows that we're here.",
    "What? Are we safe?",
    "I really don't think he intends to hurt us.",
    "Once a borrower has been seen, the human's curiosity can't be stopped.",
    "My mother used to tell me stories about the little people who lived under the floors.",
    "Is that you?",
    "Maybe we could be friends?",
    "Strange things have been happening here, and I know why.",
    "Tell me, Shawn, have you ever seen any little people in your room?",
    "Can't say that I have.",
    "There you are!",
    "Mother's been taken!",
    "We have to go help her.",
    "Aren't you scared?",
    "Sometimes you have to fight for the things that are worth fighting for.",
    "We will find her.",
    "Nice try!",
    "When I saw you, I just wanted to find a way to protect you.",
    "We're borrowers, and as long as we have each other to live for, we'll keep on living.",
    "Arrietty, I'll never forget you.",
    "I wonder what's taking Papa so long?",
    "Why is my first thought always that he got eaten by the cat?",
    "What's wrong with me?"
