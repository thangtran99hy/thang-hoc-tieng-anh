    "He made me feel, I don't know how he did it, like some great magician...",
    "...he made me feel like I had something to say.",
    "So when I feel like the issue is too complex,...",

    "Become a teacher.",
    "Help a teacher.",
    "Be part of appreciating the role teachers have in our society.",

    "We're never going to have great schools without great teachers."
