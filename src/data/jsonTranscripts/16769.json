    "Here is a poor shoemaker.",
    "He makes shoes in his shop.",
    "This is all the leather I have.",
    "I can only make one pair of shoes.",
    "You look tired. Begin the work tomorrow.",
    "Next morning, there is something on the table!",
    "Look!",
    "The shoemaker's wife shouts.",
    "A beautiful pair of shoes!",
    "Did you make these shoes?",
    "No, I didn't. It is magic.",
    "Then, a man comes into the shop.",
    "Oh, these are so beautiful!"
