    "A mother sheep and seven little lambs live in a house.",
    "Dears, I am going to buy some vegetables.",
    "Watch out. There is a bad wolf in the forest.",
    "He is very dangerous.",
    "Don't open the door to the wolf!",
    "Yes, mom. Don't worry!",
    "After a while, a big wolf appears.",
    "Who is it?",
    "Kids, your mommy is home.",
    "Huh?",
    "No! Your voice is so rough!",
    "The wolf goes to eat some eggs.",
    "Soon he comes back."
