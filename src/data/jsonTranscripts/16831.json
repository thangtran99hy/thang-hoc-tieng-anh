    "One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That's all.",
    "Della counted it already three times.",
    "What can I do?",
    "I can't buy anything with this.",
    "Della had saved every penny she could for months.",
    "But there was only one dollar and eighty-seven cents!",
    "Suddenly, Della walked to a mirror on the wall.",
    "She stood before the mirror.",
    "She pulled down her hair carefully.",
    "It was shining like a cascade of golden water.",
    "Della put on an old coat and went out.",
    "After a while, she arrived at a shop.",
    "Merry Christmas! May I help you?",
    "Will you buy my hair?",
    "Let's have a look at it first.",
    "Please take your hat off."
