    "Once upon a time, there lived a man and his wife.",
    "They were going to have a baby soon.",
    "They were poor but very happy.",
    "Next door, there lived an old woman.",
    "She was quite greedy and strange.",
    "I'll never give my vegetables to anyone!",
    "What's the matter with you, sweetie?",
    "Oh, I really want to eat some vegetables",
    "Don't worry. I'll bring you vegetables, anyhow!",
    "That night, the man went into the old woman's garden to get vegetables.",
    "Whoops!",
    "Who are you?",
    "How dare you steal my vegetables?",
    "I'm sorry. My pregnant wife wants some vegetables right now. So I just...",
    "Hmm... Then you can take them.",
    "Oh, thank you very much!",
    "But! You must give me your baby that your wife will bear.",
    "Will you promise?",
    "Yeah! Yes, I promise!",
    "The man was too frightened to think carefully.",
    "He climbed hastily over the wall to get back to his home."
