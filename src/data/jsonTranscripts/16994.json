    "From Legos to a 3D computer model to this:...",
    "...a motion-controlled flight simulator with the design inspired by Battlestar Galactica's Viper.",
    "Launch all Vipers.",
    "And this fully-functional project was created by these guys:",
    "John Boyer, Alex Jacobson, Sam DeRose, Joseph DeRose, and Sam Frank.",
    "Yes, these Bay Area students are in high school,...",
    "...and yeah, these kids are talented, fracking talented.",
    "Their project is for Maker Faire 2012.",
    "And here is how it works:",
    "Pilots are strapped into a six-point harness,...",
    "...then the model can take off, rolling on two axes to make you feel like you're flying.",
    "In addition to recreating the feeling of flying, we're also trying to create a totally immersive experience.",
    "So, inside the cockpit, the guys had put everything,...",
    "...from a joystick to three computer monitors that will display the full virtual experience.",
    "And that gaming software, along with the code that communicates commands between the game and the Viper itself,...",
    "...is another feature the team is building themselves.",
    "But they can't do it all,...",
    "...so the Viper is a kick-starter project,...",
    "...and with 28 days left, the team was already more than 1000 dollars over their 2500-dollar goal.",
    "Surprised? We didn't think so.",
