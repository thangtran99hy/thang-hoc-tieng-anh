    "If you find yourself loving someone who is no good for you, do a little self-examination.",
    "If you find that your relationship is toxic, accept it for what it is:...",
    "...attraction, not love.",

    "...someone to join them in their path to destruction.",
    "Maybe, for example, you find someone who has some of the same self-esteem issues as you do...",
    "...or emotional challenges as you.",
    "Together you each have someone to share your misery with, a mate to complain to and complain about.",
    "These are relationships based on a toxic attraction and they should not be confused with love relationships of any kind.",
    "Love is a very different process...",
    "...and has nothing to do with finding a partner to share your unhealthy patterns.",
    "Real love is able to transcend those patterns."
