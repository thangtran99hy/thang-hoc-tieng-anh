    "William Shakespeare, some say the greatest writer ever.",
    "He was born in 1564 to John Shakespeare and Mary Arden.",
    "His father made gloves for a living and his mother once worked on a farm.",
    "He lived in an English town named Stratford-upon-Avon where he went to school, we think, until the age of 13...",
    "...when his father's poor financial standing made it no longer possible for him to attend.",
    "In 1582, he married Anne Hathaway, who also used to be a farmer.",
    "At the time of their marriage, she was already several months pregnant.",
    "Together they had a daughter, Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith."
