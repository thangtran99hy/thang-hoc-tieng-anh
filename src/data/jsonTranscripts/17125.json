    "Hi, I'm Bella Thorne and I've been bullied my whole life.",
    "It started when I was about five or six and it was before school...",
    "...because I spoke Spanish, that's my first language,...",
    "....and everybody called me weird because I didn't speak like everybody else.",
    "So, I completely dropped Spanish to fit in so that people would stop calling me names,...",
    "...and now I have to try to retake Spanish because I want to learn it.",
    "And that's the cause of bullying.",
    "Then it continued, just for something different.",
    "It was because I wasn't able to read as everybody else.",
    "People called me dumb and stupid.",
    "And now, to this very day,...",
    "...I get really nervous so that I can barely read in front of a large crowd.",
    "And that was because I was dyslexic.",
    "I'm taking a stand against bullying because it's wrong and hurtful,...",
    "...and it can harm everybody in different ways.",
    "Will you take one with me?"
