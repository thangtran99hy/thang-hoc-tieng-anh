    "Hi! This video is about the /ə/ sound.",
    "A common challenge with the /ə/ sound...",
    "...is that the speaker will sometimes move the sound forward.",
    "So a word like \"but\" sounds like \"bit\".",
    "Now, let's practice.",
    "Place your tongue behind your lower front teeth and stretch from the back.",
    "That's the /ə/ sound.",
    "Now let's practice with a few words...",
    "...and notice the /ə/ sound is in unstressed syllables.",
    "Here is the /ə/ when it starts a word.",
    "Apply,..",
    "...observe,...",
    "...admire,...",
    "...again,...",
    "...awake,...",
    "...achieve.",
    "Now let's try the /ə/ in the middle of a word.",
    "...Automatic,...",
    "...meditate,...",
    "...manicure,...",
    "...capacity,...",
    "...California.",
    "Now let's give it a shot at the end of a word and keep it nice and easy!",
    "India,...",
    "...Sherpa,...",
    "...pasta,...",
    "...data,...",
    "...soda.",
    "You may have noticed that the /ə/ sound can actually be spelled in English...",
