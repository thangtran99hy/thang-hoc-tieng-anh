    "Last Saturday was my mom's birthday.",
    "Did you buy anything special for her?",
    "No, I didn't buy anything for her.",
    "I cleaned the house and cooked dinner instead.",
    "Then did your mom get nothing for her birthday?",
    "My brother gave her a bunch of flowers and a hair pin.",
    "My dad bought her a beautiful dress and a scarf!",
    "Wow.",
    "She might be very happy.",
    "My dad wants nothing for Father's Day.",
    "Last year I gave him a tie and now he has enough ties.",
    "My sister gave him a hat and now he has enough hats.",
    "My brother gave him socks and now he has enough socks.",
    "Mom gave him a computer game and now he has enough games.",
    "This year, Dad wants nothing but we have a plan.",
    "We will watch TV, watch TV.",
    "We will play, play, play.",
    "And we will give him the biggest hug just for Father's Day."
