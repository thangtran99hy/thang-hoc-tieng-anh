    "Hi, Jamie.",
    "Hi, Sandy. Where are you going?",
    "I'm going shopping.",
    "Is your sister going shopping, too?",
    "No, she isn't. She is going fishing with my dad.",
    "Anyway, where are you going, Jamie?",
    "I'm going hiking with my brother.",
    "Wow! Have a good time, Jamie.",
    "I'm going camping with my mom and dad.",
    "We pack our tent, sleeping bags, and cooking gear.",
    "We drive to the lake, and we set up camp.",
    "We build a fire to cook hamburgers and hotdogs.",
    "We get into our sleeping bags and look at the stars.",
    "We see a bear eating berries in the morning.",
    "Mom catches three fish, and I catch a turtle.",
    "Our camping trip is over, and it's time to go home!"
