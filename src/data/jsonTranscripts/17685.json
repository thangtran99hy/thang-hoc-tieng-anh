    "Let's read this storybook. Can you find a bear?",
    "Yes, Dad. Look at this! A bear goes into the tunnel.",
    "Then, can you find boys?",
    "I see a boy coming out of the tunnel.",
    "And there is another boy that goes through the forest.",
    "Where are rabbits? Can you find them?",
    "Yes, I see a rabbit that goes over the hill.",
    "Good. And I see another one that goes around the corner!",
    "Roads, roads, roads, roads go everywhere.",
    "I see a road going around corners, and it winds around.",
    "Roads go through the country, and they go to big cities.",
    "I see a road going up and down the hill like a roller coaster.",
    "Roads go over mountains, and they go through forests.",
    "I see a road going into and coming out of the tunnel.",
    "Roads cross over rivers, and they are on bridges.",
    "I see a road that just stops. Wow, it is a dead end."
