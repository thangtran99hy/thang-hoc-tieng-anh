    "Of course you can.",

    "I look on the chair, under the chair, and behind the chair.",
    "I follow our dog Chomps, and look in Chomps' bed.",
    "I see a sock, a ball, and Danny's rabbit. But no bear.",
    "I open Danny's old blanket, and I see Clare's bear!",
    "Chomps did not take the bear. It was Danny.",
    "Now Clare thinks I'm the best detective in the world."
