    "Hi, Karen. I saw you shopping for clothes the other day.",
    "You did? Why didn't you come to me and say hello?",
    "I was in a hurry to get somewhere.",
    "Anyway, how much do you spend on your clothes?",
    "Umm... I usually spend just 20 dollars buying my clothes.",
    "What are you doing, Brian?",
    "I'm trying to solve these math problems.",
    "Do you want me to help you with the math problems?",
    "Yes, please.",
    "I spent two hours on these problems.",
    "But I still don't know how to solve them."
