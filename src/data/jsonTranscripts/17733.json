    "70-year-old equestrian Hiroshi Hoketsu has qualified for the London Olympics.",

    "However, that won't make him the oldest Olympian ever.",
    "That honor goes to Oscar Swahn of Sweden, who competed in the 1920 single shot running deer rifle event at the age of 72.",
    "Hoketsu hasn't seen too much success in the Games,...",
    "...but he comes from a country that honors their elders and doesn't have this mentality.",
    "Hey, I guess they're right. Senior citizens, although slow and dangerous behind the wheel, can still serve a purpose.",
    "I'll be right back.",
    "Don't you go dying on me!",
