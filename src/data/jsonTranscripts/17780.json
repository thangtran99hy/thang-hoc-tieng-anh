    "Hi, this video is focused on the /z/ sound.",
    "/z/ is a voiced fricative consonant sound.",
    "So you should feel some friction or vibration between the tip of your tongue and the gum ridge.",
    "You make the /z/ sound by raising the tip of your tongue toward the gum ridge, but not touching.",
    "You should feel a vibration and buzzing between the tongue and the gum ridge.",
    "/z/",
    "One of the most common mistakes in making the /z/ sound is devoicing and turning it into a /s/ sound.",
    "This usually happens at the end of a word.",
    "So the word like \"knees\" ends up sounding like \"niece\".",
    "By the way, you should be aware that the /z/ sound is sometimes spelled with a letter 'Z' in English, but it is often spelled with a letter 'S'.",
    "So this can certainly be confusing.",
    "Let's work together and develop the energy we need for the /z/ sound.",
    "D, N, Z.",
    "D, N, Z.",
    "D, N, Z.",
    "Now, add the vowel e.",
    "Dee, Nee, Zee.",
    "Dee, Nee, Zee.",
    "Great! Now, let's try some words comparing /s/ and /z/ endings.",
    "Peas, Peace.",
    "His, Hiss.",
    "Pays, Pace.",
    "Plays, Place.",
    "Fleas, Fleece.",
    "Great! Now, let's try some words that are spelled with the letter 'S' but end with the /z/ sound.",
    "Remember, if the sound before the letter 'S' is voiced then the 'S'  is pronounced like /z/.",
    "Trees.",
    "Beds.",
    "Maids.",
    "Leagues.",
    "Hums.",
    "Pays.",
    "Sneezes.",
    "Make sure to try some more practice on EnglishCentral and good luck."
