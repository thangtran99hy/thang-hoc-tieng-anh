    "Hi. This video is going to focus on the /k/ sound.",
    "/k/ is a voiceless consonant sound.",
    "The /k/ sound is produced by bouncing the back of your tongue off of the soft palate.",
    "Think of it like a trampoline action in the back of your tongue, /k/,...",
    "...feel the back of your tongue jumping to touch the soft palate and release.",
    "The most common challenge with this sound is a lack of muscularity...",
    "...so you lose the energy of the /k/ and you might even drop the sound altogether.",
    "This can lead to a mumbling quality or can even change the meaning of the word.",
    "This tends to happen toward the end of words.",
    "Listen to the difference when I pronounce a few word pairs.",
    "Stack, sta.",
    "Pick, pih.",
    "Lock, la.",
    "Can you hear and feel the energy of /k/?",
    "You see, there is a big bounce happening and a release of air on the sound.",
    "Now, let's practice together.",
    "Here's an exercise that can help you develop more energy and action in the back of the tongue.",
    "I call it, \"Trampoline for the K\".",
    "Try using your hands like I do to mirror what is happening in your mouth.",
    "The goal for this is to actually inhale and exhale on the /k/ sound.",
    "Let's try that together a few times.",
    "/k/, /k/, /k/, /k/, /k/, /k/.",
    "You can actually do this 10 or 20 times on your own and feel that trampoline bounce each time.",
    "Now, let's try a few words with that action of the /k/",
    "Cat.",
    "Kick.",
    "Kept.",
    "Prickle.",
    "Snacking.",
    "Slacker.",
    "Back.",
    "Tech.",
    "Flick.",
    "Try this out as you practice on EnglishCentral and good luck!"
