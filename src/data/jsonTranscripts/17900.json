    "﻿Hi! This video covers the /h/ sound.",
    "As you might have guessed, /h/ is a voiceless sound.",
    "It is a fricative, which means, you may feel some friction or airflow on the back of your tongue.",
    "You make the /h/ sound by relaxing the back of your tongue and releasing air.",
    "You will feel the air between the back of your tongue and the soft palate. Like this, /h/.",
    "Some English learners will find that they make the /h/ sound a bit further back, so it sounds more like this, /h/ or this, /h/.",
    "In this case, you'll want to move the sound forward and relax the back of your throat a bit more.",
    "So think about sighing, like this.",
    "And then take away the vowel, /h/.",
    "Another challenge comes into play depending on the vowel sound that follows the /h/ .",
    "Sometimes, when it's followed by a /u/ or /ʊ/ sound, it can be a bit more challenging.",
    "And the reason for this is that the consonant /h/ is placed closely to these two back vowel sounds.",
    "So let's try practicing the /h/ sound in relation to the /u/ sound and the /ʊ/ sound.",
    "Your challenge is to gently release your breath on the /h/ and then add the voice of the vowel sound.",
    "So try this with me.",
    "/h/, /u/, who.",
    "/h/, /u/, whose.",
    "/h/, /u/, hoot.",
    "/h/, /u/, hoop.",
    "/h/, /ʊ/, hook.",
    "/h/, /ʊ/, hooked.",
    "Can you feel the /h/ before the vowel?",
    "Now, for an extra challenge, let's try the /h/ before the yu sound.",
    "First, let's try the combination together.",
    "/h/, yu, hu, /h/, yu, hu, /h/, yu, hu, /h/, yu, hu.",
    "And now let's try a few words.",
    "Human.",
    "Huge.",
    "Humane.",
    "Humility.",
    "Humor.",
    "Keep up your practice on EnglishCentral and good luck!"
