    "/ŋ/.",
    "People sometimes confuse the /ŋ/ sound with the /n/ sound.",
    "So the word \"sung\" can sound like \"sun\"  or they can add a \"g\" into the middle, so a word like \"singer\" sounds like \"sing-ger.\"",

    "Keep the contact between the back of your tongue and the soft palate and send your voice over that. /ŋ/.",

    "Bringing not bring-ging.",
    "Belonging not belong-ging.",
    "And swinging not swing-ging.",
    "Now, let's try comparing the /ŋ/ sound with the /n/ sound at the ends of words.",
    "Remember, that the back of the tongue must be like a ski slope and touching the soft palate.",
    "The front of the tongue is relaxed, like this /ŋ/. Here we go.",
