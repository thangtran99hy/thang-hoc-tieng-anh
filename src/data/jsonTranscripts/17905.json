    "﻿Hi! This video focuses on the /ʊ/ sound.",
    "/ʊ/ is a back vowel sound made with the lips slightly rounded.",
    "The tip of the tongue is relaxed and touching behind the lower front teeth for all vowel sounds.",
    "To make the /ʊ/ sound, the back of the tongue needs to be a bit higher than the front of the tongue...",
    "...and the lip corners are slightly forward like this: /ʊ/, /ʊ/.",
    "A common challenge with the /ʊ/ sound is that the speaker will overround the lips and bring the tongue up too high.",
    "This creates the /u/ sound.",
    "So a word like \"could\" ends up sounding like \"cooed.\"",
    "A great way to practice the /ʊ/ sound is in relation to the /u/ sound.",
    "So use your hands to mirror what the tongue is doing and try this along with me.",
    "/u/, /ʊ/, /u/, /ʊ/.",
    "Can you feel how the tongue drops and the lips are more released for the /ʊ/ sound?",
    "Let's try this again.",
    "/u/, /ʊ/, /u/, /ʊ/, /u/, /ʊ/.",
    "Now let's try some words that contrast the two sounds.",
    "Look, Luke.",
    "Full, fool.",
    "Pull, pool.",
    "Would, wooed.",
    "And now a few sentences.",
    "Finally, the fool was full.",
    "The horse should be shoed.",
    "Keep up your practice on EnglishCentral and good luck!"
