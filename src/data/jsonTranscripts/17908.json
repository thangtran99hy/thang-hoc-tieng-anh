    "﻿Hi! This video is focusing on the /ʒ/ sound.",
    "/ʒ/ is a voiced consonant sound and you'll feel friction as your voice buzzes between the blade of your tongue and your gum ridge.",
    "You make the /ʒ/ sound by directing the blade of your tongue toward the gum ridge without touching it like this, /ʒ/.",
    "The sides of the tongue should be touching the sides of your upper teeth.",
    "Here are two common mistakes with the /ʒ/ sound.",
    "The first is devoicing, so you turn the /ʒ/ sound into a /ʃ/ sound.",
    "And the result is a word like \"garage\" sounds like \"garach\".",
    "The second challenge is turning the /ʒ/ sound into a /s/ sound, so a word like \"treasure\" sounds like \"treassure\".",
    "Let's work together to find the correct placement of the /ʒ/ sound.",
    "We'll do that by pressing the blade of the tongue on the gum ridge to make the /n/ sound...",
    "...and then releasing to feel the buzzing flow of air for the /ʒ/ sound.",
    "Okay, try along with me.",
    "/n/, /ʒ/, /n/, /ʒ/, /n/, /ʒ/.",
    "Now, let's add the /j/ sound, so you could feel the sides of your tongue on your upper teeth.",
    "And you can do it with your hands as well, mirroring what's going on in your mouth.",
    "/j/. Feel the sides of your tongue and hold them there, and now move the blade up for /ʒ/.",
    "Let's do that together. /j/, /ʒ/, /j/, /ʒ/, /j/, /ʒ/.",
    "Good. Now that you have the placement, let's try some phrases.",
    "Beige garage.",
    "Casual massage.",
    "Envision pleasure.",
    "Unusual camouflage.",
    "Be sure to put this into practice on EnglishCentral and good luck!"
