    "This Olympics means the most to me because I think I'm taking it most serious.",
    "Not that I didn't take Beijing serious but, I did.",
    "But this time I'm a little older and I understand more just the importance of the Olympics.",
    "It takes guts.",
    "It takes hard work.",
    "And it takes a lot of determination to do really well at the Olympics.",
    "Standing on the podium is amazing.",
    "And winning the gold medal, it's really no better feeling.",
    "The first thing I'm gonna do if I win a medal is go to McDonald's and have a fish fillet.",
    "I am Serena Williams, I am a tennis player...",
    "...and I'm really excited to represent the United States of America at the Olympics."
