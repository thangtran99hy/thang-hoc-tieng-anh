    "Years ago, people thought that volcanoes were mountains of fire,...",
    "...but we now know that volcanoes are really openings in the surface of the Earth.",
    "There are about 1500 active volcanoes around the world and most of these are in an area called the Ring of Fire around the Pacific Ocean.",
    "The surface of the Earth is actually made up of huge plates of rock called tectonic plates that are moving all the time.",
    "Most volcanoes form where these plates move against each other.",
    "In these places, rock beneath the surface can become so hot that it melts, forming magma.",
    "The magma then erupts through openings in the plates, forming volcanoes.",
    "When magma reaches the surface, it's called lava.",
    "If the lava is runny, it flows like water down the sides of a volcano.",
    "But if the lava is thick and sticky, it doesn't flow as far.",
    "It usually forms volcanoes with steep slopes.",
    "Sometimes, the eruption can create a large hole at the top of the volcano called a crater.",
    "One of the world's most active volcanoes is Kilauea on Hawaii.",
    "In fact, it's been erupting since 1983.",
    "Luckily, Kilauea's eruptions are pretty gentle, so tourists can come to see them.",
    "But some volcanoes are a lot more violent.",
    "Yeah, like Mount Vesuvius.",
    "When it erupted in 79 A.D., it buried the whole town of Pompeii.",
    "Hot ash, poisonous gas, and rocks came down from the mountain, killing 2,000 people.",
    "But volcanoes don't just destroy things, they create things too.",
    "Volcanoes and the lava they release have created 80% of the Earth's surface,...",
    "...and given us much of the air we breathe today.",
    "Yup, and lava makes really great soil for growing plants.",
    "So, volcanoes are windows to a boiling hot Earth beneath the surface.",
    "And they feed the planet as well."
