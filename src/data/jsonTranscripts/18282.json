    "Hello everyone!",
    "My name is Mati, and I love airplanes!",
    "Do you love airplanes?",
    "I hope so, because we're gonna see a lot of them today.",
    "I'll show you some really old airplanes and some new ones.",
    "And a lot of them can go really fast.",
    "Cool, huh?",
    "Look, it's going backwards!",
    "Bet you haven't seen that before.",
    "Look, it's flying upside down.",
    "It's really fun.",
    "Plug your ears!",
    "Coming in for a landing!",
    "Look, I'm doing a wheelie too.",
    "It's so much fun!",
    "I still need to practice a little more.",
    "Flying an airplane is so much fun.",
    "I hope you had a lot of fun too.",
    "Now, it's time for me to go flying.",
    "See you next time!",
    "Goodbye!"
