    "So, I danced to this new song, that I don't know if you all know about this \"Gangnam Style\"...",

    "How do you do it?",
    "You have to take your shoes off; you're not gonna be able to dance like that.",

    "This is nice.",
    "Alright.",
    "And by the way, can I introduce myself?",

    "Why don't you try?",
    "One, and two, and three, and four.",
    "And your hands have gotta be soft like this, and bounce like you're riding an invisible horse.",
    "Bounce like this, and then it goes like this.",
    "Alright. Theme of the music. One, two, three, four!",
    "Okay.",
    "That is Psy!"
