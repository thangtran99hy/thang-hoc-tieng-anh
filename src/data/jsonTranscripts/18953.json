    "We'd started the Cartoon Network or were in the process of doing it...",
    "...and I said, you know, there ought to be a cartoon series that has some meat on the bones.",
    "And I said, \"We need a superhero for the Earth,\"...",
    "...and I came up with kind of a Superman type, Superman, Batman type character...",
    "...who was green and really we decided that...",
    "...but at that point I got a woman named Barbara Pyle who worked with me in the environmental area.",
    "And I got her involved, and she and a fellow named Nick Boxer really produced the show, they took it to the next steps...",
    "...but I came up with the idea of Captain Planet: we had to have a name for him.",
    "And Superman wouldn't do it, that was already taken so...",
    "...Captain Planet was a good name.",
    "There's a lesson and message as well as great entertainment in every episode.",
    "I was an environmentalist when I was a little kid; the natural world fascinated me.",
    "I was reading books before I could read, looking at the pictures of animals and birds and flowers."
