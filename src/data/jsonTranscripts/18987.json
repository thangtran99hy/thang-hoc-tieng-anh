    "HzO are the developers of WaterBlock.",
    "WaterBlock technology is the thin film nanotechnology...",
    "...that through a gas deposition process is injected into an electronic device,...",
    "...coats it and then it doesn't matter if water gets inside...",
    "...doesn't damage electronics.",
    "Wait, so you're saying you don't actually have to get some kind of plastic cover for your phone...",
    "...or anything like that, suck out all the air, then stick it in water, you just, you coat it?",
    "Yeah, finally you don't have to sacrifice looks or aesthetics for a big bulky case or cover.",
    "Now this is designed for accidents, obviously,...",

    "...because not the outside is mechanically sealed: the inside is coated.",
    "Everything inside that matters or is necessary to operate the device is coated or protected."
