    "Getting the perfect haircut can really depend on your face shape.",
    "Luckily, Jeremy Davies-Barbala of the Sassoon Salon in Beverly Hills...",
    "...is here to tell us what works best for the most common face shapes:...",
    "...heart, square, round or oval.",
    "We think that's more of a square-shaped face...",
    "...and we're gonna be really bringing more accentuation to the fantastic jawline and cheekbones.",
    "We are gonna graduate the shape through the bottom to get more of a profile.",
    "And then through the sides we do more of a layering technique.",
    "What can happen with curly hair is it really can crowd the face...",
    "...quite a lot, so what we want to do is create a shape that moves away from the face,...",
    "...creating a beautiful profile.",
    "We are working with an oval-shaped face here and we really want to make sure that the hair in the front isn't too long...",
    "...because if it is too long it can tend to elongate the face.",
    "So I'll pull it down a little, so we are gonna be working with some length in here...",
    "...and a very suitable heavier fringe, making sure that the fringe is no longer than the chin...",
    "...so the face doesn't look too elongated.",
    "Then with a heart-shaped face it really is all about the cheekbones.",
    "So internally we need to get a slimmer shape so that it can be all about that fringe,...",
    "...which we're gonna sit just down to the cheekbone, through there.",
    "No matter what your face shape is,...",
    "...your hairstyle should also fit your personality and your lifestyle.",
    "So have fun with it.",
    "Thanks for watching BellaSugarTV."
