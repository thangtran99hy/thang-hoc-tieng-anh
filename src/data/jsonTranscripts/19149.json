    "Hi. I'm Dr. Lillian Glass.",
    "You know, believe it or not, a person's voice can tell you whether or not they're telling the truth or they're lying.",
    "One of the first giveaways as to whether or not a person is lying or telling the truth,...",
    "...is that they clear their throat a lot.",
    "You may hear a lot of \"ahem\", a lot.",
    "Now, this isn't always the case, but it's often the case when a person lies.",
    "So when you hear that, that may be a giveaway...",
    "...because the vocal muscles which are tiny little muscles,...",
    "...the size of a thumbnail,...",
    "...close off and it's hard for the air to get through.",
    "Also when that happens, you may hear what's called a creaky tone or a glottal fry.",
    "...so they may sound like this.",
    "So they may die off at the end and they may not tell you the truth when they get everything out.",
    "Because what's happening when they're lying, all their muscles are tightening, including their vocal muscles.",
    "So it's hard for them to get the truth out, so to speak.",
    "So listen to a person's voice quality.",
    "Listen for the creakiness of their tone like I just said, that kind of croaky voice.",
    "And also, listen to the throat clearing...",
    "...because that can give away a lot in terms of whether they're telling you the truth or not.",
    "This has been Dr. Lillian Glass with mahalo.com.",
    "And if you'd like more information about body language and communication skills,...",
    "...go to my website: www.drlillianglass.com.",
    "And if you'd like to see more videos, they're right here."
