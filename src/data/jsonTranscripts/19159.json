    "God may well be with us in our mansions on the hill.",
    "I hope so.",
    "He may well be with us in all manner of controversial stuff.",
    "Maybe, maybe not.",
    "But the one thing we can all agree, all faiths, all ideologies,...",
    "...is that God is with the vulnerable and the poor.",
    "God is in the slums, in the cardboard boxes where the poor play house.",
    "God is in the silence of a mother who has infected her child with a virus that will end both their lives.",
    "God is in the cries heard under the rubble of war.",
    "God is in the debris of wasted opportunity and lives,...",
    "...and God is with us if we are with them."
