    "How do you define social entrepreneurship?",
    "So, a social entrepreneur wants to leave a place better than he or she found it.",
    "That is a lesson that my father taught me, that was taught to him by his mother.",
    "But if I think, if you distill it down what is a social entrepreneur,...",
    "...it is someone that cares about the world...",
    "...or their community or their family or an individual...",
    "...and wants to help make that situation better...",
    "...through his or her actions and leadership and idea.",
    "And we know that can be for-profit, it can be non-profit.",
    "I quite frankly wish that we could stop using those words...",
    "...to describe what it is that we do because quite frankly they're legal structures.",
    "You can have nonprofits that are terrible and that hurt the world,...",
    "...and you can have for-profits that are great and help the world.",
    "The best are the ones that do well and do good...",
    "...and that are social enterprises and that are cause driven, that are socially driven.",
    "And I think the world could use more of them."
