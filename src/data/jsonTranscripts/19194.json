    "Hello, this is Jared Polak, the owner of The Growth Coach,...",
    "...and I'm gonna cover how to overcome sales objections.",
    "Okay, the most common thing people say is:...",
    "...\"I don't have enough money.\"",
    "If someone says, \"I don't have enough money,\"...",
    "...the first thing you should do is what we consider RACCing them.",
    "R A C C: you need to restate the R, answer the A, check the C and continue.",
    "For example, \"I don't have enough money.\"",
    "\"Okay, Mr. Client, you don't have enough money, is that what you're saying?\",...",
    "...you're restating it.",
    "And then the business owner says \"yes\" or the client says \"yes\",...",
    "...and then you answer them.",
    "\"Would it make more sense, would it benefit you...\"",
    "\"...if we pay it in monthly installments?\"",
    "Then you're answering them.",
    "And if they say, \"Oh yeah, that actually worked for me,\"...",
    "...so as opposed to them not having the money,...",
    "...they really don't have the money to pay in full...",
    "...but they might be able to do monthly payments, so you answer them.",
    "And then you check.",
    "\"Does that work for you?\", kind of nod your head,...",
    "...and then they say \"yes\", and then you continue.",
    "Continue, \"Okay, great, would you like to endorse here the agreement?\"",
    "So again, restate, answer, check, continue for all objections.",
    "Again this is Jared Polak, the owner of The Growth Coach."
