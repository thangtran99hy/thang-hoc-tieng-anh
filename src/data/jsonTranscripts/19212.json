    "If you could refund me on this one and give me the right one, that'd be great.",
    "I'd be glad to, but unfortunately our deadline for our return policy has passed,...",
    "...but if you could give me a copy of your original receipt and your class schedule,...",
    "...I'll be more than happy to give you our store credit,...",
    "...or you can take it to buybacks and get 50 percent off in cash of the shelf price.",
    "That'd be great, I'll take the store credit.",
    "Okay.",
    "Here is my receipt and course schedule.",
    "And I'd need a copy of your driver's license as well.",
    "Here you go.",
    "Thanks.",
    "Now, let me get you the right book.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Here you go.",
    "Sorry about that.",
    "It's fine.",
    "This is perfect.",
    "Thank you.",
    "There you go.",
    "Have a good day.",
    "Thank you, you too.",
    "You're welcome."
