    "We need more stories told from a girl perspective.",
    "And they shouldn't just be for girls.",
    "This one, it's a mainly girl audience.",
    "But Hunger Games isn't.",
    "And I do think that boys should be reading books about girls written by girls...",
    "...with the first person narrative of a girl.",
    "Because we read those books about boys all the time...",
    "...and I just feel like it's such a disconnect that they don't read our stories.",
    "Because there's that stigma attached to it.",
    "Like I said, it's not these books that are gonna make that jump.",
    "But I think we need to be moving in that direction,...",
    "...and hopefully we are.",
    "It was at times grueling.",
    "It was a really long process.",
    "It was also, at times, sad as we got to the end...",
    "...they were like, \"Okay, this has been really hard but now we're not gonna see each other anymore.\"",
    "And then there was also the sense of \"Okay, we did it.\"",
    "We got it done.",
    "We got all of the movies done and that felt really good.",
    "I have all along kept expecting for the bittersweet to hit,...",
    "...and I just feel like it's a party.",
    "It feels very sweet tonight.",
    "I'm having a really good time and I'm not sad at all yet.",
    "So, I'm hoping that that feeling lasts."
