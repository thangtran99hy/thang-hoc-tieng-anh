    "...but Tony definitely has, and always has historically in the comic books,...",
    "...even more so, his inner demons.",
    "We did a little of that in Iron Man 2,...",
    "...but if you think about someone who saw the skies open up...",
    "...and came through a wormhole and fought off alien species,...",
    "...suffice to say he's a little rattled.",
    "Robert, we heard that you're signed up to do a big stunt...",

    "...and what's their jurisdiction and where's the overlap happening...",
    "...how does it make each of them feel.",
    "So a lot more of that gets looked into in this film."
