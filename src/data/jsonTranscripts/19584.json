    "Hi there.",
    "I'm \"Dear Abby\" and you've got good advice.",
    "If I had to say what the overarching philosophy of this column is...",
    "...it's just \"Answer the question.\"",
    "I want to answer concisely, kindly, logically and briefly.",
    "My involvement with the column began when I approached my mother for an allowance.",
    "When I asked her for money,...",
    "...she said, \"Well, what are you going to do to earn it?\"",
    "And I said, \"Gee, I don't know.\"",
    "And she said, \"Well, I have an idea.\"",
    "\"Why don't you answer mail from other teenagers in order to earn your allowance?\"",
    "That became my little job.",
    "She told me that if I answer the question appropriately,...",
    "...she would sign it and mail it out.",
    "And if I didn't, what she was going to do is make me do it over and over and over.",
    "And believe me, I did my share of answering letters over and over.",
    "By 1987, I was writing the column.",
    "Because of the Internet, the reach of the Internet, my readership is international.",
    "And the one thing that I have learned since writing this column is people are human beings.",
    "They have the same feelings.",
    "They have the same problems.",
    "They fall in love with the wrong person.",
    "They hate their mother-in-law.",
    "They're concerned about their husband or his drinking or whatever.",
    "There's workplace problems.",
    "There's neighbor problems.",
    "Everybody has the same kinds of problems.",
    "What I love best about being \"Dear Abby\" is knowing that they trust me...",
    "...and that I can find the answers that they're looking for."
