    "What's happened is in the last decade or so,...",
    "...we've just been able to collect lots and lots of data in places...",
    "...we've never been able to collect before.",
    "Now the question is what do we do with all these data?",
    "Basketball is kind of a dance.",
    "There's always sort of moves and countermoves.",
    "Pick and rolls and screens.",
    "The statistics that we have right now are the best we can do as a function of the box score.",
    "This guy took a shot, that guy got a rebound.",
    "Now with this new optical tracking data,...",
    "...you get to see the game in a way that you can never see it before.",
    "So, the question is how do you translate that data into something that can help them win.",
    "Before, taking a long two-point shot was a bad idea...",
    "...because it had a low probability of going in.",
    "What we figured out was...",
    "...not only is it bad for that reason,...",
    "...it's bad because that's the worst type of shot when trying to get back.",
    "These are new insights that we were able to get from the data that we didn't have before.",
    "Slight shifts in strategy,...",
    "...slight changes in which players you play,...",
    "...which plays you run...",
    "...are going to affect who wins and loses.",
    "These are all the things that are not that different in sports and in business.",
    "If you know more, if you can see more, you could make better decisions.",
    "And data is a way of making what was invisible visible.",
    "It's an art in it of itself."
