    "They want this.",
    "They need that.",
    "And if you don't give it to them,...",

    "But at some point you have to start looking after your own interests.",
    "At Barclays, we've created a family springboard mortgage.",
    "You can put your savings towards your loved one's mortgage...",
    "...but you'll get your money back with interest up to three years.",
    "Because what goes around, should always come around.",
    "For all of life's little challenges, you could always count on your bank."
