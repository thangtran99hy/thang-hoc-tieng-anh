    "This vacation has been a year in the planning.",
    "And here you are, standing, nay, staring down your dreams.",
    "The rest of your holiday hinges on the moment you walk through that door.",
    "The door opens.",
    "You hold your breath.",
    "And then you realize you got it right.",
    "You got it booking right.",
    "Because it doesn't get any better than this.",
    "It doesn't get any booking better than this.",
    "Look at the view.",
    "Look at the booking view!",
    "This is exactly what you booking needed.",
    "Bask in the booking glory at over a quarter million properties.",
    "Planet Earth's number one accommodation site, Booking.com.",
    "Booking.yeah!"
