    "My name is Tia Kratter, I've been at Pixar 16 years,...",
    "...and I have quit every year for the past 11 years.",

    "She's worked on just about every film.",
    "I grew up in a family of practical jokesters.",
    "It's April 1st, 1998; something like that.",
    "So I e-mailed the entire company and said I'm leaving Pixar.",
    "Goodbye.",
    "And I got about 20 to 30 people that bit.",
    "A couple of women in the production office...",
    "...actually went out and ordered this beautiful little chocolate cake.",
    "The benefits were so good that I just thought, \"I have to do this every year.\"",
    "I just fell for it.",
    "She said a nice goodbye, but it was April 1st that she sent the mail...",
    "...and halfway through the mail you realize, she's not quitting...",

    "She quit again this year.",
    "It is so much fun."
