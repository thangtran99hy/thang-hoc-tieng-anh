    "I'm Joy Behar and you've got Easter traditions.",
    "When I was a kid, it was a major holiday.",
    "The whole family, the Italian family, would gather around my Aunt Rosa's table...",
    "...and stuffed themselves into oblivion with all the food she would cook.",
    "Well, there was an Easter pie that was made.",
    "My Aunt Rose, she would make, it's called the pizza rustica.",
    "And it's this big Italian pie and it consists of, basically, cholesterol.",
    "You have tons of cheese, you have about a dozen eggs in there,...",
    "...heavy cream, salami, and she would bake this thing.",
    "We would eat it on Good Friday and Easter Sunday we would rise from the dead.",
    "Egg hunting was left for American types.",
    "We were Italian Americans and we had a meatball hunt.",
    "We didn't do an egg hunt.",
    "Now I like an egg hunt...",
    "...because I don't have any eggs of my own anymore.",
    "My grandchild has just been born, his name is Luca.",
    "And he's an Italian baby and he's gonna have Italian Easters.",
    "Because now I have a grandchild, I'm gonna bring all the traditions back so...",
    "...I got this doll for him.",
    "You know, some kids have bunnies and they have little chicks.",
    "But you know, this is my idea of a toy for an Italian Easter child.",
    "Pretty freaking weird isn't it?"
