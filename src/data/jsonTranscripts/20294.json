    "Today, my ambulance knew all about a bike accident...",
    "...just by talking to a helmet.",
    "It grabbed the patient's record before we even picked him up.",
    "It found out the doctor we needed was at St. Anne's.",
    "And they got his okay on treatment from miles away.",
    "It even pulled strings with the stoplights.",
    "My ambulance talks with smoke alarms and pilots...",
    "...and stadiums, but of course, it's a good listener too.",
    "Today, Cisco is connecting the Internet of everything.",
    "So everything works like never before."
