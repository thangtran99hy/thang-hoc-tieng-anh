    "Okay.",
    "And how did you two meet?",
    "We met about 18 years ago.",
    "We kinda, sorta fell in love, and a decade later we ran into each other.",
    "No, you wrote a book and I read about it and went to look for it.",
    "That's very romantic.",

    "I wanted you to say something romantic and you blew it, okay?",
    "You are the mayor of crazy town.",
    "Do you know that?",
    "You are.",
    "This is how people start breaking up.",
    "Oh my God!",
    "I assure you,...",
    "...that guy you vaguely remember, the sweet, romantic one that you met on the train?",
    "That is me.",
    "Why am I finding myself so attracted to this woman?"
