    "It's been said that the best songs don't give answers but instead ask questions.",
    "So, why?",
    "Why can a song change the world?",
    "Because music is a force.",
    "For good.",
    "For change.",
    "For whatever.",
    "It's bigger than us.",
    "It lives inside us.",
    "Because we were all conceived to a 4/4 beat.",
    "Because music can't be stopped, can't be contained.",
    "It's never finished.",
    "Because music makes us scream \"Coo coo ca choo\" and mean it.",
    "Because music is worth fighting for.",
    "Why?",
    "Because it's music."
