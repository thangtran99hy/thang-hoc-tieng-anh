    "Welcome to \"English in a Minute.\"",
    "In American English, when someone responds to you by saying, \"In your dreams,\"...",
    "...does he mean that you're actually dreaming?",
    "Guess what?",
    "This weekend, I caught a fish this big.",
    "No way.",
    "Yeah, it was huge!",
    "In your dreams!",
    "There's no way you caught a fish that big.",
    "\"In your dreams\" is a different way of saying \"I don't believe you\" or \"There's no way that's true.\"",
    "It is a way to tell people that you think they are making up a story.",
    "And this phrase is used in a playful manner, usually with a smile.",
    "In your dreams!",
    "In your dreams!",
    "In your dreams!",
    "And that's \"English in a Minute.\""
