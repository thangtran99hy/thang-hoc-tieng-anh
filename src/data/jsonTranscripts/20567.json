    "Have you ever heard this before?",
    "I'm starving, let's grab a bite.",
    "If someone has ever told you in English that they were going to grab a bite,...",
    "...and you were confused, this is the right program for you.",
    "All this talk about food is making me hungry.",
    "Yeah, I'm starving too.",
    "Do you wanna grab a bite?",
    "Sounds good.",
    "In American English, when you say you want to grab a bite,...",
    "...it means that you want to eat right away, or that you're interested in eating quickly.",
    "If you want to make plans or sit down and have a nice, fancy meal at a restaurant,...",
    "...you may want to say something else instead.",
