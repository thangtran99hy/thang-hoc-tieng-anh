    "Britain, isn't it time you said goodbye to your unloved rooms?",
    "We've all got one.",
    "A cupboard that used to be a bedroom.",
    "A kitchen that's slowly become an assault course.",
    "A jungle that should've been a lawn.",
    "The room with no name.",
    "And the barbecue that time forgot.",
    "You can do it Britain.",
    "Take up your wallpaper brushes, your wood stain, and your barbecue charcoals.",
    "Fire up those lawn mowers and grab your grout guns.",
    "And turn the unloved into the unbelievable.",
    "So we can once more love our living rooms, bedazzle our bedrooms,...",
    "...and make our spare rooms feel special again.",
    "For everything you need from B&Q, search unloved rooms today."
