    "I mean the greatest advice that I have ever for kids...",
    "...is sort of the advice that I think was most impactful for me...",
    "...which is that your voice matters and your ideas.",
    "If they're important to you and they make you feel something, they give you the chills,...",
    "...then that's what the audience is gonna feel...",
    "...when they see it, or hear it, or read it.",
    "And so, all I would really say is that, believe in what you're thinking,...",
    "...believe in what you're feeling and what you want to say...",
    "...and make sure that you do everything you can to get it out there.",
    "It doesn't mean that you're always right,...",
    "...it doesn't mean that you shouldn't take criticism or notes or hear reactions...",
    "...and make adjustments if it feels right...",
    "...but I think just being aware that your voice is as valid as anyone else's...",
    "...is sort of the most important piece of advice.",
    "All right, when somebody knocked you down said you couldn't do it,...",
    "...was there like a phrase that you would repeat in your head to keep you focused?",
    "It's not so much there was any kind of one idea or phrase...",
    "...but I think the thing that you have to remember is that...",
    "...anyone who's ever succeeded at anything has gotten beaten down...",
    "...has fallen off, has failed, has made mistakes...",
    "...and you can't ever succeed if you don't expect that...",
    "...and almost embrace it and realize:...",
    "...By being knocked down, by being criticized or by being rejected,...",
    "...that it means you're playing the game.",
    "And it means you're doing it and that's something to be celebrated...",
    "...and then keep going but not to ever take that as a no or an end...",
    "...but rather as a necessary turn in the journey of your experience."
