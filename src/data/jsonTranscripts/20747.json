    "More than anything, we use our phones to connect with the people we care about.",
    "This is Facebook Home.",
    "From the moment you turn on your phone, you see what friends are sharing.",
    "Your latest messages, calls, and updates are right up front.",
    "And you can keep chatting from any app, so no matter what you're doing,...",
    "...your friends are always right there with you.",
    "Home.",
    "A whole new experience for your phone."
