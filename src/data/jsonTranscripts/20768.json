    "I'm Luke Taylor.",
    "I'm 15 years old and I'm passionate about science and especially robots.",
    "I love spending time outdoors, riding my bike, swimming, playing sports...",
    "...and hanging out with my friends.",
    "Being outside inspires me to look at things and see how they've evolved.",
    "I see things and I want to make them better.",
    "It makes me ask questions.",
    "For example, there are so many water shortages and yet we are completely surrounded by it.",
    "Surely, there must be a way of turning it easily into drinkable water.",
    "My love for science and robots started at a really young age.",
    "I've always been curious.",
    "I was the sort of kid who loved pushing buttons...",
    "...because I wanted to know what would happen.",
    "Then I started watching science fiction movies like Star Wars and Iron Man.",
    "I was totally hooked.",
    "For me, science is exciting because it's about pushing the world forward...",
    "...for the benefit of humankind.",
    "My friend Tembela was given a robotics kit for Christmas,...",
    "...and he was telling me how he loved building robots but struggled with the programming.",
    "And that gave me an idea for a project.",
    "How can I talk to robots in English?",
    "The biggest challenge I faced was that robots are actually a bit stupid.",
    "They don't understand context or body language,...",
    "...so the instructions you give them have to be really clear and exact.",
    "The project was a success.",
    "I now have a robot that understands over 100 commands in English,...",
    "...and my friend Tembela can now speak to his robots.",
    "That's pretty epic.",
    "Asking questions is important.",
    "We all need to ask questions.",
