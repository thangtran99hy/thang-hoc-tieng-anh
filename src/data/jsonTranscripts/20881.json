    "Hi everyone!",
    "So, you're wondering about the history of Ctrl + Alt + Del.",
    "You know, there was actually a time when, if your computer got stuck,...",
    "...you literally had to turn it off, wait for it to come back on again.",
    "But one of the original designers of the PC, David Bradley, designer of the original IBM PC,...",
    "...he originated the design Ctrl + Alt + Esc as a way of having a soft reboot.",
    "But he found that with this method, you could easily do it by mistake...",
    "...and boot yourself out of a project you were working on.",
    "So, he designed the next level of the soft reboot Ctrl + Alt + Del.",
    "Why?",
    "Because it's absolutely impossible to do with one hand.",
    "You definitely need two of them, if you consider the keyboard structure,...",
    "...you need two hands to do a soft reboot, that's why they changed it from the original method...",
    "...to Ctrl + Alt + Del because that way, there could be no accidents...",
    "...and you could not accidentally reboot your machine when you didn't want to.",
    "So, there is just a little bit of a history of Ctrl + Alt + Del.",
    "Next time you try, please do so wisely."
