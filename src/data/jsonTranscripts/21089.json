    "But you know, your husband's name is on the corner right there.",
    "Please watch your step here.",
    "Unbelievably beautiful what they're doing with this memorial.",
    "The trees, every detail; I'm totally overwhelmed and impressed at every pebble in place.",
    "You know the story about the survivor tree?",
    "No.",
    "C'mon, let's take a look.",
    "So there was one tree that actually was within the debris field.",
    "When tower one fell down, it crushed the tree and no one even knew the tree was there.",
    "DDC personnel found this tree with maybe three branches that had leaves on it.",
    "The rest was burned to a crisp.",
    "It'd been nursed back to health.",
    "Oh wow, that is wonderful!",
    "There's a timeline on the tree.",
    "You can say this gnarled stuff is 9/11, and everything after is the day after.",
    "It was so badly charred, they had to cut the limbs off.",
    "Right here, you see all the little points where the dark bark stops and the clean bark starts?",
    "That's post-9/11.",
    "This is the trauma from 9/11.",
    "This is the rebirth after.",
    "She's a fighter; she's a survivor.",
    "What kind of tree is it?",
    "This is a Callery pear tree.",
    "Callery pear.",
    "Callery?",
    "Callery, yes; C - A - L - L - E - R - Y.",
    "I gotta remember this.",
    "It doesn't give fruit but it flowers.",
    "OK.",
    "In April of every year, it flowers beautiful white flowers.",
    "I want to plant one in my house.",
    "Definitely.",
    "I've been talking about getting seeds, and maybe getting saplings.",
    "I think people would jump on this...",
    "...because it's light.",
    "To have the child of the survivor tree.",
    "Definitely.",
    "I mean, I would.",
    "Okay.",
    "The last living thing to leave the site, and now it's back.",
    "Unbelievable."
