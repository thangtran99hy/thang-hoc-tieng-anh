    "But a common fear that I get from people is...",
    "...that they don't know how to start conversations.",
    "They're worried that they'll say the wrong thing...",
    "...or they just don't know what to say at all.",
    "So towards that end, I'm gonna share a great conversation starter with you.",
    "And the conversation starter is...",
    "...to give someone a genuine compliment about something they're wearing.",
    "Look at them, choose something that you like that they're wearing...",
    "...and give them a compliment on it.",
    "It's important that the compliment's genuine.",
    "You actually wanna like it because people can tell.",
    "And if you give them a genuine compliment,...",
    "...they'll enjoy it because people like getting compliments.",
    "You can say they have a nice shirt or...",
    "...you like their shoes, where did they get them, whatever it is.",
    "Here, there's a girl sitting at a table in a cafe.",
    "If you give her a compliment on the book she's reading, she'll happily talk to you.",
    "She likes the book, she likes the author.",
    "She'll want to get into a conversation about it.",
    "And here's a guy in a bus who really likes shoes.",
    "He's got a great pair of shoes on so if you compliment his shoes,...",
    "...he'll happily talk to you about them...",
    "...and then you can move from there into another conversation.",
    "And this girl's been kind of lonely at the party all night.",
    "No one's talked to her.",
    "So if you give her a compliment on the bracelet she got in Thailand,...",
    "...she'll tell you about her travels and you can move then to another conversation."
