    "ï»¿I know I get really nervous before a party...",
    "...and most people I know do too.",
    "So what I do is I get all my flowers done the day before the party.",
    "That way I don't have to think about that.",
    "All flower arrangements done.",
    "Then I like to have all my platters and my serving pieces ready to go.",
    "I lay those out the night before.",
    "And I kind of know exactly where I want stuff to go.",
    "I think as much as possible if you can pull out all your serving pieces ahead of time,...",
    "...get your flowers ready, you can enjoy the day to cook.",
    "And that's the really fun part."
