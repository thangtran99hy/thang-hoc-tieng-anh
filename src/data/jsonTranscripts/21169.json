    "I think that what I love about New York City, there's a little bit of everything.",
    "And every day when you get up and walk to school,...",
    "...you might see something you've never seen before.",
    "I love exploring.",
    "Every street is different.",
    "You're experiencing the real world with the college life.",
    "What I love about New York is the diversity.",
    "I like everything mixed together.",
    "When I'm walking on the street I don't wanna see one of the few things.",
    "I wanna see things that I don't even know what I'm seeing.",
    "New Yorkers are busy not unfriendly.",
    "They're really kind people and they know what's up.",
    "What I find is that a lot of people that grew up...",
    "...in those towns with triple-digit populations and everything...",
    "...and then they come here.",
    "They stay here.",
    "I love this city and I'll always love this city...",
    "...and it's going to be a part of me forever."
