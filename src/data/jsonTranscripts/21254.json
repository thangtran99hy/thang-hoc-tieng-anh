    "Every year as October ends, Mexico turns its thoughts to those no longer with us...",
    "...during the colorful Day of the Dead fiesta which is deeply rooted in indigenous culture.",
    "It's a sacred time to remember friends and relatives who have passed on.",
    "Families visit their loved ones' tombs to keep them company on this special day.",
    "For Mexicans, death is just another part of life.",
    "In fact, it's more a cause for celebration than for mourning.",
    "Folks spend time sprucing up graves with a splash of color...",
    "...and engaging the departed in ongoing conversation.",
    "It's as if they'd never really left."
