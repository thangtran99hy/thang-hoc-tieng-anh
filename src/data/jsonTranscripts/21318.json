    "The very first Thanksgiving celebration in North America took place in Canada...",
    "...when Martin Frobisher, an explorer from England, arrived in Newfoundland in 1578.",
    "He wanted to give thanks for his safe arrival to the New World.",
    "For many Canadian families, the tradition has shifted...",
    "...and the focus is now to eat a large turkey dinner and get together with family."
