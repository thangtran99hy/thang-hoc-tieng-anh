    "There's been a little bit of distance now since the passing of Steve Jobs and...",
    "...you address some of the rivalry in the past.",
    "But I'm really intrigued by the anecdote at the end of Walter Isaacson's book...",
    "...you spoke about how in his final months you came to his house, came in through the kitchen,...",
    "...and the two of you spent a couple of hours together reminiscing...",
    "...and really made peace despite years of your ideological differences.",
    "What do you remember about that time?",

    "And that had huge strengths, particularly the last episode where he ran Apple,...",

    "We talked about the other companies that had come along.",
    "We talked about our families and how lucky we've both been in terms of the women we married.",
    "It was great, relaxed conversation."
