    "We're here with Josh, one of the co-creators and producer of Halloween Haunted House.",
    "Josh, what are we about to get into?",
    "Some pretty hard-core stuff.",
    "We tried to create a new kind of haunted house where you have to walk through alone.",
    "Basically test your limits, push you as far as you can go...",
    "...and try to be as radically different from any of the other haunted houses in the city.",
    "And what is the best reaction you've seen so far?",
    "People crying, shaking, panic attacks, anxiety attacks.",
    "That's good for us.",
    "That's success.",
    "I think that's solid.",
    "I have no idea about any of this.",
    "All right.",
    "Oh god!",
    "Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god!"
