    "All the credit goes to the staff, the players that supported me.",
    "What kind of pressure was on him every single night?",
    "Jon Lester told me after game five...",
    "...he was biting his nails when he was on the mound pulling for this guy.",
    "What pressure did he feel?",
    "To tell you the truth, I almost threw up.",
    "Kaz, let me ask you, your dad says he almost threw up out there.",

    "Did you get sick when he was out there or were you excited?",
    "Excited."
