    "...start off with a spooky gooey game and the kids love this one.",
    "It's called \"Guess the Monster Parts.\"",
    "The kids put their hands inside the boxes...",

    "So this one right here, grapes for the eyeballs.",
    "And this one here is some chopped up Jell-o for the monster's brains.",

    "The monsters got ears and those are dried apricots.",
    "And then this one is positively gross and the kids love it.",
    "Spaghetti for the intestines.",
    "The kids have a really fun time digging their hands in and guessing all the parts."
