    "My friends were taking ballet classes so I asked my mom to take me to the ballet class.",
    "My mom didn't want me to dance so she took me to English class.",

    "...and I just didn't leave and I asked my mom to sign me up.",

    "...you just forget everything about pain and suffering and everything in the rehearsal.",
    "That's how I keep going."
