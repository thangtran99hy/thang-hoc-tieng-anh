    "Today, I'm gonna tell you how to use the website Pinterest as a marketing tool.",
    "Here are three tips.",
    "Tip number one: Bring the wow factor.",
    "Pinterest is all about imagery so having artistic, well-photographed pictures is key.",
    "Instead of pinning tons of stock items,...",
    "...select just a handful of cool, custom products to photograph.",
    "Next, be sure to provide a link to take anyone who checks out your pins back to your home page.",
    "In turn, on your website, drive views by adding a Pinterest button similar to a Facebook button.",
    "Now for tip number two: categorize ideas.",
    "Simply pinning products on pages won't help you stand out.",
    "A better approach is to organize or theme products into idea or event categories.",
    "Pick out promotional items that will be good for birthday parties or weddings.",
    "Choose other items that will be good for a fitness program for example.",
    "Update your categories often and try to pin it at times people are most active like at lunchtime or in the evening.",
    "Next, there's tip number three: Follow the leader.",
    "Winning attention on Pinterest takes time and effort...",
    "...but you can speed up the process by following and interacting with the most popular pinners.",
    "Also, encourage comments about your pins by asking questions.",
    "Finally, if you're already invested in social media, leverage that by cross networking.",
    "For example, you can now embed a pin right onto your blog."
