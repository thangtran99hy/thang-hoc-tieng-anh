    "The A, number one most critical thing at a party is to have good lighting.",
    "First of all, turn off the overheads.",

    "Additionally, I would say candles everywhere.",
    "When you fill a room with candles, little magical things happen,...",

    "...that creates all that sparkle and reflection.",
    "It feels so festive.",
    "It feels like you really tried."
