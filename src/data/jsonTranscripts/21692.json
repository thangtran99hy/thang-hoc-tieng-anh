    "Welcome.",
    "Today's topic is wooing.",
    "One of you asked, \"Can someone use flattery and still seem to be honest?\"",
    "Entirely too smart of a question I think.",
    "But of course, if it comes from an honest place,...",
    "...if you mean it and are sincere, she'll know.",
    "It's all in the voice, the intonation.",
    "Like if you wanna tell her she has beautiful eyes, just say it like this,...",
    "\"Your eyes are like the stars,\"...",
    "\"...pinpricks in the curtain of your night face.\"",
    "Anyway, hope that helps."
