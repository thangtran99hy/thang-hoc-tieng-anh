    "Hey Lisa, it's Kip.",
    "We should chat on the phone sometime soon, smiley face.",
    "That's not a smiley face.",
    "That's a winky face.",
    "You're gonna e-mail her your phone number and think that's gonna get you somewhere.",
    "Why didn't he ask for my number, though?",
    "He must have a pager.",
    "You obviously don't understand women.",
    "What I just did was brilliant.",
    "I can't call him right away 'cause that'd be weird and...",
    "...I can't respond right away because then he'd be like, \"Why didn't you just call me?\"",
    "I made the first contact, that's aggressive.",
    "And then I just gave her my contact for my phone.",
    "That's like, whatever, I don't care.",
    "Oh wait hold on, I got an e-mail. It looks like it's Lisa.",
    "Let's open that.",
    "All right.",
    "Oh well, she e-mailed me her number.",
    "But before... hey, shut up.",
    "So, should I call him?",
    "No.",
    "So then what am I supposed to do?",
    "You can't call him.",
    "Text before call.",
    "You don't go from e-mail to phone call.",
    "You go from e-mail to text to third-party messenger.",
    "How about, \"Hey Lisa, yo what's up?\"",
    "No, keep \"yo\" out of this.",
    "\"Hey, Lisa.\"",
    "\"Hey, Lisa.\" That's a good start.",
    "\"Hey Kip, it's Lisa. How you doing?\"",
    "\"How are you doing?\""
