    "Hello guys.",
    "Glad to meet you.",
    "Do you know who I am?",
    "I'm part of an army that's everywhere.",
    "What?",
    "You don't see us around you?",
    "We're very, very, very tiny.",
    "You can't see us with open eyes.",
    "You can only see us under a microscope.",
    "But we're everywhere.",
    "On the doorknob, on the table, on your skin, everywhere.",
    "We're also called microbes as we can only be seen under a microscope.",
    "And some people call us germs, too.",
    "Germs, yes, germs!",
    "We can cause many diseases."
