    "It wasn't so long ago that if you wanted to share music,...",
    "...you did it with physical objects called cassettes.",
    "We call these mixtapes.",
    "And you are not going to believe how difficult it was to make one.",
    "The first thing you needed was a blank tape.",
    "A package of blank tapes was like a box of potential.",
    "The songs had to be painstakingly recorded one by one in real time.",
    "Some people would even listen to the radio all day, waiting for their song to come on...",
    "...just so they could capture it on a mixtape.",
    "If you didn't plan, you might run out of tape in the middle of a song.",
    "And then, you had to do that whole side over again."
