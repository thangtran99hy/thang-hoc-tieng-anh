    "The Fastest Growing Companies list is unusual for Fortune.",
    "Unlike the Fortune 500, it's not a bunch of names you already know.",

    "...appeared on this list many years before they became national names.",

    "...there are energy companies, all of which you'd expect.",
    "And then in the end, there are always the wild cards."
