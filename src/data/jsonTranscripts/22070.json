    "A lot of companies try to take their construction toys...",
    "...and make them pink to appeal to girls.",
    "And while, yeah, it's true, girls do like pink,...",
    "...I think there's a lot more to us than that.",
    "So, I've spent the last year researching this.",
    "How do you get girls to like a construction toy?",
    "It all kinda came down to one simple thing:...",

    "\"She likes to think outside the box.\"",
    "So I came up with a really simple idea:...",
    "...what if I put those two things together?",
    "Spatial plus verbal, book series plus building set.",
    "How long's the ribbon?",
    "I took the story and my prototype and I tested it with over a hundred kids.",
    "We got it!",
    "Daddy! You have to watch this.",
    "And that's how Goldieblox was born."
