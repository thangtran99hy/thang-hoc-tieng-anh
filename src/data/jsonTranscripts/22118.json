    "Beneath, his flying footsteps froze the ground;...",
    "...And with his garments' rustling fell the snow;...",
    "...His lightest touch made icicles abound;...",
    "...His breath, as when the keenest north winds blow.",
    "He paused above the river, dull and gray,...",
    "...turbid and chafing with a restless pain.",
    "And soon in icy quietness it lay,...",
    "...bound, bank to bank, within his Arctic chain."
