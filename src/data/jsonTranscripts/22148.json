    "The world is full of giants.",
    "They have always been here, lumbering in the schoolyards,...",
    "...limping through the alleys.",
    "We had to learn how to deal with them, how to overcome them.",
    "We were small but fast, remember?",
    "We were like a wind appearing out of nowhere.",
    "We knew that being clever was more important...",
    "...than being the biggest kid in the neighborhood.",
    "As long as we keep our heads down, as long as we work hard,...",
    "...trust what we feel in our guts, our hearts, then we're ready.",
    "We wait until they get sleepy, wait until they get so big they can barely move,...",
    "...and then walk out of the shadows, quietly walk out of the dark and strike."
