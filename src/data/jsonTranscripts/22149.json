    "What is technology?",
    "What can it do?",

    "By using your hands, you can actually control your x-ray.",
    "Technology has the power to unite us.",

    "Do you see him?",
    "I can see him.",
    "Papa!",
    "It inspires us.",
    "Technology has taken us places we've only dreamed.",
    "Now, I can do whatever I want.",
    "It gives hope to the hopeless.",
    "So, your device is on.",
    "Can you hear me talking?",
    "And it has given voice to the voiceless."
