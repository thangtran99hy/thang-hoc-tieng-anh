    "ï»¿The biggest mistake I made was my first business venture.",
    "I owned a sports paraphernalia store.",
    "I was the owner and the buyer.",
    "I went and I started buying jackets.",
    "So give me twenty of them, a hundred of them hats,...",
    "...thousands of those jerseys and little t-shirts.",
    "Brought it back to L.A. and put it in the store.",
    "But nobody bought anything for a couple of months.",
    "What I did was I bought everything I liked...",
    "...and nothing that the customer liked.",
    "So that taught me a valuable lesson: always make my business about the customer."
