    "Getting people through the doors of a store can be tough.",
    "Now, instead of having to try to get people to come to you when you're open,...",
    "...you just go to them when it works out.",
    "And Teresa Grim and her husband's Fashion Mobile can go anywhere...",
    "...unlike the clothing store they used to own.",
    "We found an old Star Tribune truck on Craigslist...",
    "...and paid about the same as that we were paying in one month's rent at the store.",
    "The boutique on wheels even has a dressing room,...",
    "...full-length mirror and a little curtain so you can try on an outfit if you wanna check it out."
