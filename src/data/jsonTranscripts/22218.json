    "You know, this business of ours is an exciting business.",
    "And one of the core things that we've got to realize...",
    "...is that this business does not really respect tradition.",
    "What it respects is innovation on a \"go forward\" basis.",
    "So it's really our collective challenge that we now need to make Microsoft thrive...",

    "That's the core challenge that we collectively have to face up to.",
    "And I cannot be more honored, more humbled and more excited...",
    "...about Microsoft and our opportunity.",
    "Thank you all."
