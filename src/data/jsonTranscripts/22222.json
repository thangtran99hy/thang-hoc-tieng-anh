    "I love you very very much, more than the whole world.",
    "...I think that when I love you, I love you in a big way.",
    "How tired I am of this unbearable distance between us, how I long for the toll of the recess bell.",
    "Yes I do. I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you.",
    "I don't want him in my heart. I want him here with me.",
    "I'm in love with you and I want you to pick me instead of him.",
    "...but yeah, he won my heart.",
    "Oh, I love you, my prince.",
    "Good. 'Cause I like you.",
    "I love you."
