    "And she's been eating with them ever since.",
    "From first hour through the end of the day,...",
    "...Chy's guys make it a point to look after her.",
    "And this group's newfound friendship has changed the game.",

    "...but to Chy, high school is a new world,...",
    "...a safe one.",
    "You say, \"My team, these are my boys,\" right?",
