    "I get asked a lot, \"How do you patent an idea?\"",
    "And I read a terrific book called \"Patent It Yourself.\"",
    "Fantastic book, very straightforward and I wrote GoPro's first patent.",
    "And the 60-page tome that I went maniacal on, and then, when I took it to attorneys...",
    "...to get their opinion on it, they told me that I saved a ton of money...",
    "...because I have done all this work myself and they could polish it up...",
    "...and finish it off.",
    "And so, I save myself a bunch of money but more importantly it gave me an understanding of...",
    "...what is patentable and what not.",
    "And I think any entrepreneur that is inventing something, that book is phenomenal.",
    "That's, I think, the only book that I read...",
    "...was \"Patent It Yourself.\""
