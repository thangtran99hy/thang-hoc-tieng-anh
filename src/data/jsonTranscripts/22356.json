    "My name is Dr. Karen Shane, I am a veterinarian.",
    "The best part about being a veterinarian is interacting with animals...",
    "...and also being able to cure them and treat their illnesses.",
    "Every day that I come to work I am rewarded with a new reason for why I became a veterinarian.",
    "The most exciting thing about being a veterinarian is that no two days are the same.",
    "I will see healthy puppies and kittens as well as patients that come in for surgeries."
