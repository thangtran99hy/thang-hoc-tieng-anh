    "The hare was making fun of the tortoise.",
    "He said,...",
    "...\"You are so slow.\"",
    "\"It will take you days to reach anywhere.\"",
    "Is that so, you arrogant hare.",
    "Let's have a race and see who is faster.",
    "The angry tortoise decided to challenge the hare and teach him a lesson.",

    "They decided on the racing path and chose the fox as the umpire.",
    "The rivals started as expected.",
    "The speedy hare soon left the tortoise far behind.",
    "Having reached halfway, the hare decided to take a break.",
    "What a lovely summer day it is.",

    "Never make fun of anyone's weakness.",
    "Pride and arrogance will always lead to your downfall.",
    "The hare accepted his defeat graciously...",
    "...and apologized to the tortoise for his rude behavior."
