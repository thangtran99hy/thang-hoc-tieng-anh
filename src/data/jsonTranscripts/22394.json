    "Today, we're going to see what happens when you put Ivory soap in the microwave.",
    "Ask your parents to take a bar of Ivory soap and cut it into little pieces like this one.",
    "Now we're going to put it in the microwave for about 80 seconds to see what happens.",
    "As you can see, the soap has expanded.",
    "Ivory soap is the only soap that will float in water.",
    "This is because of all the air pockets inside of it.",
    "When heated, steam is created in those air pockets,...",
    "...which is pushing out the soap, making the soap expand.",
    "The soap is not hot, it feels really cool when you touch it.",
    "This is a really fun experiment to try at home."
