    "It's everything you've ever dreamed,...",
    "...a land of majestic vistas that defy the imagination,...",
    "...where whales and bears play, mountains soar to the heavens...",
    "...and vast rivers of ice descend to the sea.",
    "This is Alaska,...",
    "...a landmark experience in any traveler's life,...",
    "...America's last great frontier.",
    "And only Princess can make sure you see all the best of it,...",

    "...to the frontier and gold rush towns of the Inside Passage...",
    "...and to the abundant wildlife Alaska is known for...",
    "...with friendly authentic hospitality every step of the way."
