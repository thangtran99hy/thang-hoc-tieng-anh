    "I'm there to provide an image of the reality on the ground and a picture...",
    "...and so if I can be that messenger, then my pictures will have a purpose.",
    "And that moment when I was being pulled out of the car and have guns on me...",
    "...and then being shot at, and I'm sort of walking on a wall of bullets,...",
    "...and then I'm taken and thrown on the ground and have a rifle to my head...",
    "...and they're deciding whether to execute me.",
    "Yeah, I say \"What am I doing here?\", of course.",
    "Why do I do this job?",
    "Why can't I just be like, you know, at home or doing some nine-to-five job?",
    "But I realize that this is who I am and this is what I believe in...",
    "...and I could never do anything else."
