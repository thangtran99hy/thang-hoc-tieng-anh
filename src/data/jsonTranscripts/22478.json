    "My dad was in the restaurant industry for 30 years, and he worked really hard...",
    "...and he didn't want any of his children to work in the restaurant industry.",
    "I thought that the only thing I'd ever be is be honest and truthful,...",
    "...and cooking wound up being something I love to do.",
    "It was the first time in my life where I was like, I wanna wake up early.",
    "I wanna get to work and I wanna be a sponge,...",
    "...and I wanna help out as much as possible.",
    "And it sort of dawned on me that, you know,...",
    "...like very few people ever get to experience that."
