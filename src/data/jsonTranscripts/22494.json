    "This is a tip that was actually shared with us by a realtor friend of mine.",
    "And he told me, \"Just remember the word FORD when you're in a conversation with anyone...\"",
    "\"...and it will help you spark up conversations.\"",
    "The way this works is basically just remember the acronym FORD.",
    "F stands for family, so ask people first about their family.",
    "People love to talk about their family.",
    "The O is for occupation.",
    "You can ask them about their job or how their job is going.",
    "R is for recreation, so you can ask them about their hobbies.",
    "People love to talk about that stuff, of course.",
    "And then D is dreams.",
    "So if you always remember that acronym: Family, Occupation, Recreation and Dreams,...",
    "...just remember the word FORD."
