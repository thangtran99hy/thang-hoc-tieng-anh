    "Hi, I'm Sally and I'm gonna show you how to make the gooeiest of brownies.",
    "These are the ingredients you're going to need.",
    "The chocolates and butter I've melted in the microwave for two minutes on high.",
    "You want to whisk the eggs with the sugar.",
    "You got a nice, creamy, ribbony texture there.",
    "Perfect!",
    "Now, in goes the flour and the cocoa powder.",
    "Using a spatula, just fold that through in a figure of eight.",
    "And at this point, start pouring in the butter and chocolate.",
    "And then, it's gonna go into greased and lined baking tin,...",
    "...cooked at 180 degrees centigrade for between 30 and 35 minutes.."
