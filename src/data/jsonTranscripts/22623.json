    "Well, I'm a 22-year-old performance artist based in Austin, Texas.",
    "The kind of people that I gravitate towards tend to have lived like a multitude of lives.",

    "Oh, I am in a wholehearted, committed relationship to my art.",
    "I like to explore identity and culture and history and legacy.",

    "...but I don't call it drag,...",
    "...I call it performance art."
