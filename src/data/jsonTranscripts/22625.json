    "I am a PHD student at The Graduate Center in Manhattan.",
    "I'm in the animal behavior program...",
    "...and I'm doing research out at Brooklyn College, studying octopus anesthesia.",
    "In the European Union last year,...",
    "...they passed a law that octopuses have to be treated with the same care as vertebrates.",
    "So that means they have to be anesthetized and no one's really researched that yet.",
    "So what I'm trying to figure out is what's a safe way to do that.",
    "My very first phone was pretty cool...",
    "...but I wanted to spice it up a bit so I bedazzled it.",
    "I left it in the car and all the jewels melted off because it was so hot in my car.",
    "And then my phone was just like this really sticky mess for a while.",
    "And all the glue is still on it but not bedazzled."
