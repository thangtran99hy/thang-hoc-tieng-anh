    "When I was in high school, this interesting thing happened where I made a decision...",
    "...that I was forever gonna do exactly what it is that I want with my life...",
    "...which is creativity, painting, drawing, sculpting, building, making.",
    "I don't consider myself a street artist.",
    "I consider myself a fine artist that likes to dabble in the street.",
    "I mean, ever since I was a little kid, I was in love with Buzz Lightyear.",
    "And then when I grew up, I kind of just made him a metaphor to me.",
    "You have the hand of God embracing what Buzz means to me.",
    "So in my eyes, it just kind of a symbol for doing things...",
    "...that others think aren't possible at the time.",
    "Yeah, I'm just kind of treating life as a playground...",
    "...and waking up and doing everything that I want to do every day."
