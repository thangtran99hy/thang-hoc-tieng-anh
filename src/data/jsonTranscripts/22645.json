    "I'm 24 years old from Brooklyn, New York.",
    "I'm a still life photographer and I just started a nonprofit organization...",
    "...with a friend for sustainable living in New York.",
    "And I am sometimes commercial and body parts model.",
    "So the body parts that I model are hands, legs and feet.",
    "My first couple of jobs, I'm like \"Oh, this is really easy.\"",
    "I go in for a few hours and I get to make money off just having limbs.",
    "But actually you have to really use your whole body.",
    "It's not just really one part of your body.",
    "I was doing an ad for Target and I was holding a contact lens...",
    "...and it's like a super close-up macro shot.",
    "I'm like standing there for, I don't know, probably a few minutes just holding this contact lens.",
    "And I put so much energy and focus into this one finger.",
    "Yeah, I thought about getting a full-time job somewhere,...",
    "...I just can't imagine myself doing a normal commute from 9 to 5 or something.",
    "I like to be able to do what I want to do when I want to do it.",
    "I'm a cat person, so I'm very independent."
