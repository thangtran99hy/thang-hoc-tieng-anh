    "ï»¿Of all the games in the world, which matters most?",
    "One caught in the glare of a million flashes...",
    "...or another in the hazy light of a suburban sun?",
    "Does it matter whether two or ten or ten to the power of ten people watch?",
    "Not in the heat of battle.",
    "Not when you've given everything, to give even more.",
    "Whether the pitch is a pitch, or a square of dust, every kick has a consequence.",
    "And a goal, is a goal, is a beautiful goal.",
    "The game that matters most is the one you're playing."
