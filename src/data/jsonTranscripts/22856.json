    "And, one of the things I've always found is...",
    "...that you've got to start with the customer experience...",

    "And as we have tried to come up with a strategy and a vision for Apple,...",
    "...it started with, \"What incredible benefits can we give to the customer?\"",

    "...\"and figure out what awesome technology we have\"...",
    "...\"and then how are we gonna market that?\"",

    "Some mistakes will be made along the way.",
    "That's good because at least some decisions are being made along the way...",
    "...and we'll find the mistakes, we'll fix them.",
    "Mistakes we made, some people will be pissed off,...",
    "...some people will not know what they're talking about,...",
    "...but I think it is so much better than where things were not very long ago.",
    "And I think we're gonna get there."
