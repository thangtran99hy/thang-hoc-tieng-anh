    "My name is Mary Yuan...",
    "...and I'm a senior public relations manager in corporate communications at AT&T.",
    "I think my favorite part about working here is probably the environment.",
    "It's a really, really fast-paced environment, but it's also really collaborative.",
    "And so you have a lot of people with different expertise all working together...",
    "...and so you really get a taste of different parts of corporate communications.",
    "And so when you're putting together a plan, you have all of these unique perspectives...",
    "...that really makes the overall plan a much better one.",
    "So, I think the collaborative environment and all of these people...",
    "...who are coming from different backgrounds really make it fun to work here."
