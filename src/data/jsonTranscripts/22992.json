    "I consider Paige like a long-lost sister that I never had that I should have had.",
    "The crazy thing is, me and Paige have been so close but we actually have never met.",
    "My mom was pregnant with me...",
    "...and just found out that I had one arm at 20 weeks, I think.",
    "She wanted to find someone else that was experiencing the same thing.",
    "So she went on a website and found Teresa and Paige.",
    "When me and Sarah were born,...",
    "...our parents were sending letters and pictures to each other and stuff,...",
    "...so they became close.",
    "When I first saw Paige, it was like I'd seen a mirror image of me.",

    "I can't believe it.",
    "It doesn't seem real.",
    "You're so beautiful!",
    "So are you!",
    "I'm sure we'll always find time for each other...",
    "...because it's one of those friendships that you don't find twice.",
    "We're like two needles in a haystack that just found each other."
