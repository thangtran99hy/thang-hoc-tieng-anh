    "Burger King Japan has got a new all-black sandwich series:...",
    "...black buns, black cheese, black sauce.",
    "The toppings kind of look like street tar in July,...",
    "...but Burger King hasn't steered me wrong in the past.",
    "Hey everybody, I'm Patrick Jones and welcome to Buzz60.",
    "Okay, so meet the Kuro Burger.",
    "The buns and cheese are made black by smoking them with bamboo charcoal.",
    "The black sauce is made with garlic, onion and squid ink.",
    "Does that mean it's someone's job to milk squids?",
    "Does Mike Rowe know about this?",
    "It's very easy to go uber American about the Kuro Burger...",
    "...and say, \"That's not for me, thanks.\"",
    "But if you're a fussy American eater in Japan,...",
    "...this is probably one of the tamest options."
