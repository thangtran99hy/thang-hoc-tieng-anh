    "This is all I've wanted to do since I was a little boy.",
    "And after 35 years of being in the Minnesota Orchestra,...",
    "...I love it as much now as the first day I started.",
    "But when Roger first draws the bow across the strings, especially on high notes,...",
    "...his arm shakes from a condition called \"essential tremor.\"",
    "And then once it starts then there's no stopping.",
    "This might be the end of my career.",
    "In hopes of finding treatment that could save his career, Roger went to Mayo Clinic.",
    "So we're inserting the DBS electrode now.",
    "Dr. Kendall Lee and a team of experts perform what's called \"deep brain stimulation.\"",
    "And during the entire procedure, Roger was awake, ready to play his violin.",
    "Can you play a song for us?",
    "Mayo engineers designed a device that measures Roger's tremor.",
    "While Roger plays, Dr. Lee inserts electrodes into Roger's brain...",
    "...and guides them to the site where the tremor originates.",
    "Once there, the electrodes fire electrical signals to hopefully stop the tremor.",
    "There was no guarantee it would work.",
    "You see, Roger's tremor is relatively minor and he wants 100% relief.",
    "Thankfully, it did work."
