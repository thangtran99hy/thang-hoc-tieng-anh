    "Football is the greatest drama on Earth.",
    "This is our stage.",
    "Our theater.",
    "I was born into it.",
    "Others were adopted.",
    "But we're all connected.",
    "If you don't believe we're family, you haven't felt what we felt:...",
    "...agony, tension, heartbreak.",
    "But that moment, when it comes together just right, words cannot describe it.",
    "An entire season changes with one kick, one bad decision, one slip.",
    "But one magic moment lives in our hearts forever.",
    "This is football.",
    "FIFA 15.",
    "Feel the game."
