    "Ideas are scary.",
    "They come into this world ugly and messy.",
    "Ideas are frightening because they threaten what is known.",
    "They are the natural born enemy of the way things are.",
    "Yes, ideas are scary and messy and fragile.",
    "But under the proper care they become something beautiful."
