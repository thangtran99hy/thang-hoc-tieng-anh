    "Cats love boxes because they're cryptic animals.",
    "They like to hide, and a box gives them a place of safety and security.",
    "They can get into that box...",
    "...and they can't be approached from the side or the back where they're not aware of it.",
    "The other thing is they can sit in that box, feeling safe,...",
    "...and they can watch the world go around in front of them.",
    "And if something interesting comes by, they can dash out."
