    "For a lot of guys, they think that when they're going out on a date,...",
    "...suddenly they've got to look sexy.",
    "So, they end up mistaking the idea of \"sexy\" with something that's too tight.",
    "\"Too tight\" means you're gonna be pulling at yourself all night.",
    "So remember, if you are wearing a great lightweight knit...",
    "...or you're wearing even a jersey shirt,...",
    "...it's great because it shows off your physique...",
    "...but you don't wanna see buttons pulling.",
    "Think about a color that always gets you a compliment.",
    "If you have blue eyes, guys, don't forget a blue shirt.",
    "It always works."
