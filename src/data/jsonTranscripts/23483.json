    "Imagine you're trapped in a cell with a killer and he asked you to play a game.",
    "Place your finger or the cursor on any of the green squares.",
    "You're going to make four moves.",
    "Each move may involve going across one square or several.",
    "Now move left or right to the nearest pink square.",
    "Now, move up or down to the nearest green square.",
    "Now move diagonally to the nearest pink square...",
    "...and now move either down or to the right to the nearest green square.",
    "If you've chosen any of these squares, the killer is going to let you go free.",
    "Any of these squares are absolutely fine.",
    "But if you've chosen this square, then your time has come."
