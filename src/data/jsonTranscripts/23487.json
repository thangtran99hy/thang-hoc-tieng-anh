    "When I'm working, things can get so hectic.",
    "So sometimes, I need to find an easy way to express what's most important to me.",
    "Like with my crew, I use shorthand to tell them what I need...",
    "And when I need to talk directly to my fans...",
    "But the most meaningful shorthand of all, is the one I use when I'm about to drive: #X.",
    "It's an easy way to tell everyone that I'm about to drive.",
    "And I do it every time before I get behind the wheel.",
    "Use #X to pause the conversation before you drive.",
    "Because no text is worth a life."
