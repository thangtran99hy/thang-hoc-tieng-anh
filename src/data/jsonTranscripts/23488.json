    "Music's a very personal experience.",
    "It means something different to everyone.",
    "The first time I saw the prototype, I was astonished like anyone else...",
    "...because there's something levitating above the surface that doesn't happen in nature.",
    "We're also including the latest technology inside the final version of the OM/ONE.",
    "We're using Bluetooth 4.0....",
    "...which can basically pair with most devices that are out there today.",
    "Another really cool thing about Bluetooth 4.0...",
    "...is that you can stereo pair two OM/ONEs together...",
    "...and it just makes for an incredible audio experience.",
    "There's also a Type 1 microphone in the orb, so you can use it as a speakerphone.",
    "We actually use it all the time for conference calls and meetings.",
    "And the orb has a 15-hour battery life.",
    "So when you take it with you, it requires no recharging.",
    "It truly, truly is a revolutionary piece of hardware."
