    "I love to shoot people that people turn a blind eye to when they walk down the street.",
    "Like, \"I don't want to look at that.\"",
    "Well, I want to throw that in your face...",

    "I live paycheck to paycheck, hand-to-mouth,...",
    "...but at least I hope in some small way it has some meaning to other people."
