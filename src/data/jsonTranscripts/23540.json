    "I have some breathtaking video this morning that you have to see.",
    "This is from Slovakia, where two hikers discovered a frozen lake so crystal clear,...",
    "...it appeared that they were walking on water.",
    "Isn't that amazing?",
    "Look, you can see the rocks down below.",
    "Well, turns out, snowy conditions forced the hikers...",
    "...to abandon their planned route in the mountains,...",
    "...so instead they hiked down that stunning, beautiful lake below.",
    "That is a detour worth taking there."
