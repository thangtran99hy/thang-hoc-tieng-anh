    "Hello there.",
    "What have you got your wife today?",
    "It's the 14th, Valentine's Day!",
    "You better get her something good.",
    "Some nice flowers at least or she'll know you forgot.",
    "You can't be serious!",
    "She'll know!",
    "That's still not good enough.",
    "And they smell of petrol.",
    "She'll know!",
    "You wouldn't dare!",
    "She'll know!",
    "Why not try the florists.",
    "It might be last minute, but they are used to dealing with men like you.",
    "Look at those.",
    "Now when you tell her you love her, she'll know!"
