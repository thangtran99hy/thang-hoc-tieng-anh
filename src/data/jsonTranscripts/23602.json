    "ï»¿We live in a world where billions of people...",
    "...carry supercomputers in their pockets every single day.",
    "It's an explosion that's changed every facet of our lives.",
    "It's changing how we see ourselves and our families and our friends.",
    "It's changing how we live and even how we die.",
    "It's not the future we expected, but it's here and it's moving faster than ever.",
    "This is the future.",
    "It belongs to you."
