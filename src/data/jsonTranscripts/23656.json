    "Tonight, as we stand on the edge of possibility, we choose the path less trodden.",
    "We choose to embrace the unknown with wide-eyed wonder.",
    "Tonight, we choose adventure.",
    "Who can say what the journey might throw at us?",
    "But we've conquered puffy things, bony things, bottom-of-the-sea things.",
    "With Lurpak by our side we will scoop, splash and squeeze our way through to new frontiers.",
    "That is our destiny.",
    "Then tonight, that will be our dinner.",
    "Cooks, venture forth with new Lurpak Cook's Range."
