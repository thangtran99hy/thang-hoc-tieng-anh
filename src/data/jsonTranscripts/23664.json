    "To not live someone else's life and someone else's idea of what womanhood is.",
    "Womanhood is you.",
    "Womanhood is everything that's inside of you.",
    "Be absolutely who you are and stick to your instinct and your guts...",
    "...and don't try and be like other people.",
    "And don't take the Nike campaigns and the Victoria's Secret campaigns...",
    "...and think you need bigger boobs or a better butt,...",
    "...or you need a tighter ab or whatever else.",
    "Be happy with who you are and love your insecurities...",
    "...because when you grow up, I think that's what's gonna make you you.",

    "So, that's what my mom's always told me.",
    "I followed it.",
    "Yes, its gonna be a struggle and yes, you're gonna hear a lot of nos before you hear a yes,...",
    "...but learn to enjoy the process and embrace it and have fun with it.",
    "Work hard, be so good they can't ignore you.",
    "Keep to your morals, keep to your integrity and don't stop fighting,...",
    "...because ultimately, for any dream, for any goal, it takes a lifetime.",
    "And why wouldn't you wanna give it that?",
    "Its not a race, it's a journey, and enjoy the journey."
