    "Having twins is rare enough: two sets, even rarer.",
    "But together, these four are the rarest of siblings.",
    "In fact, baby Miya and her sister Leah are two in a million, literally.",
    "Mum is white, dad, black...",
    "...and the kids, well, as they put it, they're balanced equally.",
    "I was blown away as the rest of them, you know.",
    "There is no easy way to explain it all.",
    "I feel like I'm still in shock myself even though the first ones were seven years ago.",
    "It is amazing but we say we just love them the same.",
    "I honestly didn't think that it would happen again.",
    "I thought that we'd have two of the same.",
    "Well, I didn't think that we'd have twins again for a start.",
    "Those in the know are astonished.",
    "Even nonidentical twins aren't that common.",
    "Nonidentical twins from mixed parents of different races, less common still.",
    "To have two eggs fertilized and come out in different colors, less common still.",
    "So, to have it happen twice must be one in millions.",
    "For nonidentical twins to be born, two eggs must be fertilized by two sperm.",
    "It's complicated but skin color...",
    "...is believed to be determined by genes working together,...",
    "...coding for white, black or mixed skin tone.",
    "One of Alison's eggs was fertilized by a sperm carrying Dean's genes for dark skin...",
    "...leading to Miya's dark complexion.",
    "And the other egg was fertilized by a sperm carrying just the genes...",
    "...which code for white skin meaning little Leah was born with much lighter skin."
