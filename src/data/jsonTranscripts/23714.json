    "ï»¿I'm Tony Lepore.",
    "They call me the Dancing Cop.",
    "I'm from Providence, Rhode Island.",
    "I've been directing traffic my way for 27 years.",
    "I was kind of bored one day and plus I can dance and sing...",
    "...and I always wanted to be an entertainer when I was younger.",
    "And I just did a couple of spins and some hand movements and the people loved it.",
    "I think it would be more of a distraction if I was in a different town...",
    "...and they didn't know I was out there.",
    "But most in Providence, they even know me by the sound of my whistle.",
    "My joints take a beating, you're right.",
    "But like only my chiropractor knows.",
    "It's all rhythm or I'll go and interrupt it with one of these.",
    "Or like I told you before, my hands are tied up and I can't, I'll give them one of these."
