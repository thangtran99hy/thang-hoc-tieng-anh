    "ï»¿Hey Alex, how are you?",
    "Pleasure to meet you.",
    "I have another bionics expert on hand so I thought I'd drop by.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Yes, a pleasure.",
    "Nice bow tie, by the way.",
    "Thanks.",
    "How were your travels?",
    "It's very good.",
    "Well, I thought I'd bring one of my gauntlets and match it up with yours...",
    "...and see if everything is copacetic.",
    "Do you wanna have a look?",
    "Sure.",
    "Ready?",
    "Yup.",
    "Great.",
    "Each one looks the same.",
    "Actually, I think yours might be better than mine.",
    "What do you say we both try 'em on.",
    "Do a progress report.",
    "Okay.",
    "Do you know who that is?",
    "Iron Man.",
    "What's his name?",
    "Robert.",
    "Great!",
    "I'm having a technical glitch.",
    "As you can see, my light isn't working.",
    "Half the time, I design one of these, it winds up breaking on me.",
    "But what I do is I keep working on it.",
    "Kinda like you're working on it with Albert.",
    "He keeps working and working until he gets it right.",
    "Yeah.",
    "I think yours is still a little bit more right than mine because at least, you know.",
    "The lights work.",
    "Your light works, yeah.",
    "Ah, look at that then.",
    "It's a marriage of robotic technologies.",
    "Bang, nailed it!",
    "Love it."
