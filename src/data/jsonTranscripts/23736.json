    "The world goes green.",
    "But here in Ireland, every day is bathed in green.",
    "After all, this emerald isle is like nowhere else on Earth.",
    "A rugged coast and grassy hills collide.",
    "And time can stand still or fly by.",
    "It is a place where music flows as easily as conversations...",
    "...and welcomes are warm and delivered with a smile."
