    "When I smell roses, I think of my mother.",
    "When I was a little boy, we had a rose bush in the backyard.",
    "And I remember it was yellow with red tips.",
    "And I still see it today and I think, \"Oh, it's so beautiful.\"",
    "But I think, \"Wow, what wasn't I seeing in that rose?\"",
    "If I were to see that rose and suddenly these other colors were there,...",
    "...I would think it would be kind of like poetic.",
    "First day of school, she would take me to the backyard,...",
    "...and she would cut a rose and give it to me to give to my teacher.",
    "I thought, \"What if I suddenly saw all these colors that I never saw before?\"",
    "It would be like in a way my mother was speaking again to me."
