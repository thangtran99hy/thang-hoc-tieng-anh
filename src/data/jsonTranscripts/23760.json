    "The lesson I've learned from working with stylists is...",
    "...there's only a little part of it that has actually to do with the clothes.",
    "It's about how you feel in the clothes.",
    "I've had people put me in things too tight or too big or just don't look good.",
    "They may look good but I don't feel good.",
    "I think the thing in my wardrobe which I always go to,...",
    "...that which I know is gonna look good is this designer coat that I have.",
    "It's black and it feels amazing.",
    "And even if I'm wearing tracksuit bottoms or trainers or anything,...",
    "...you just put that on the top and it looks great."
