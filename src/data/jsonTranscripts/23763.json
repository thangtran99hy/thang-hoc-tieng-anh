    "When I was 17, I got pregnant.",
    "And the light of my life is my father but he gave me 24 hours to leave town.",
    "And I gave this baby up for adoption and said at that time that I will adopt a child...",
    "...when I'm able to take care of a child.",
    "Wow.",
    "I just wasn't ready for that.",
    "I'm sure.",
    "So many times I would think, \"Gosh, is this the time to tell him?\"",
    "But I'm 73 now and it just seems like such a big secret.",
    "It's kind of funny, I think where you're concerned, I try not to be very emotional...",
    "...and I worry that you'll never know just how deeply I love you...",
    "...and how scary it is for me sometimes to imagine life without you.",
    "That's something I can't make better for you.",
    "And I don't doubt it'll be tough but you'll be okay."
