    "ï»¿Pterodactyl is just one of many flying reptiles plying the skies of the Mesozoic.",
    "Her long beak is perfect for hunting fish and other aquatic animals.",
    "She carefully selects her prey, watching intently.",
    "But in the Mesozoic, sometimes the hunter becomes the hunted.",
    "Pterodactyl is exclusively carnivorous.",
    "So the lush, fruit-bearing trees of the shore are of little help.",
    "Perhaps these rock pools harbor less aggressive prey...",
    "...or perhaps not.",
    "Her hunt's successful, this majestic queen of the skies makes for home."
