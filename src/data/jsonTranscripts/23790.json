    "Now, I'm growing up...",
    "...and I've seen many things.",

    "But now that I'm getting old, there's one thing I know:...",
    "...I'll never grow up 'cause I'll never let go...",
    "...of when I was a kid...",
    "...and I played and I played...",
    "...and looked up to others because they knew their ways.",
    "Now as I look back as to who I am now, I lift up my chin and I lift it up proud.",
    "'Cause I have spent time and gone many miles.",
    "But as I stand here,...",
    "...I remain a child...",
    "...with so much to learn and more to explore.",
    "One day I'll grow up but now I want more.",
    "One day I'll grow up, or maybe I won't.",
    "Because grown-ups are dumb.",
    "So today, I'll be young."
