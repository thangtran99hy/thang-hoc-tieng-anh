    "If your dream is to ride the tallest, steepest and fastest water slide in the world,...",
    "...then feast your eyes on Verruckt.",
    "This 17-story thrill ride is now at Schlitterbahn Water Park in Kansas City.",
    "Coming in at around 170 feet, it's taller than Niagara Falls...",
    "...and steeper than any ski slopes.",
    "The only way up to the top is climbing up 264 stairs.",
    "Incidentally, \"verruckt\" means \"insane\" in German.",
    "I guess that really is the best word to describe these crazy rides."
