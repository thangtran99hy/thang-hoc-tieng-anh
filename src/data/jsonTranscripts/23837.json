    "A dragon is coming.",
    "Come on, you beast!",
    "Stay together and we live.",
    "No, a slightly smaller dragon, tiny, really.",
    "But faster, way faster,...",
    "...and cuter, but not that cute.",
    "A dragon that's smarter, more advanced, can multitask and doesn't waste power.",
    "A dragon is coming, not to a theater, not to an enchanted little village.",
    "Nope, this dragon is coming to your phone.",
    "Well, technically, in your phone.",
    "Make sure your next phone has the blockbuster speed...",
    "...and performance hundreds of millions already love.",
    "Make sure it has a Snapdragon processor."
