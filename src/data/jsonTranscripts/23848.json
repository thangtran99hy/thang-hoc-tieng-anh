    "I think my color blindness was discovered when I was at kindergarten.",
    "I was drawing my flowers brown and my oceans black and skies were purple.",
    "I was officially diagnosed first grade.",
    "I think it's like 0.5 percent that a girl is actually color-blind.",
    "So, this is what it really looks like to you guys?",
    "For a second I felt kind of sad, like wow.",
    "I kind of have been missing out on how vibrant everything has been.",
    "And then I thought, but how cool it is...",
    "...that I now get the opportunity to see the world in a completely different way,...",
    "...and it's special to me."
