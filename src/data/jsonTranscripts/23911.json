    "In yet another cue from nature, a German company has developed bionic butterflies...",
    "...that look and fly like the real thing even in proximity to each other.",
    "Weighing little more than an ounce but with a wingspan of around 20 inches,...",
    "...each butterfly is equipped with two motors, two batteries, infrared markers...",
    "...and wings made up of soft elastic material.",
    "Designed as a technology research platform,...",
    "...a demonstration shows them flying around a room,...",
    "...installed with ten cameras, infrared tracking...",
    "...and a central computer which coordinates their movement.",
    "Several are in motion simultaneously at the same time,...",
    "...and the real-time communications prevent potentially damaging collisions.",
    "The devices were not developed to sell but represent continued research efforts...",
    "...towards making ultralight networked robotic systems."
