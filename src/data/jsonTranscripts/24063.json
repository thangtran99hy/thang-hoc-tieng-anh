    "The whip of the wind,...",
    "...the burn on my muscles,...",
    "...feet pedaling, heart pumping, wheels spinning, gasping for breath:...",
    "...this is being alive.",
    "This is freedom.",
    "In this moment, that's all that matters.",
    "My zone: it works for me.",
    "The focus and energy I feel on my morning ride stays with me all day.",
    "I'm the same person.",
    "I have the same job.",
    "I live in the same town.",
    "But everything feels new again.",
    "My eyes are open to what's in front of me.",
    "I needed the change.",
    "I don't wanna think about what life would be like if I hadn't found cycling.",
    "I'm just glad I did with enough time left to enjoy it."
