    "Hi, I'm Maddy.",
    "Have you ever considered what would happen if the Earth stopped spinning?",
    "Just how important is the planet's rotation to our lives?",
    "The Earth rotates at 1670 km/h.",
    "If we stopped suddenly, the effects would be catastrophic.",
    "We, and everything not deeply rooted to the planet, would be thrown sideways.",
    "The oceans, too, will maintain momentum,...",
    "...and within just one minute, will spread nearly 28 kilometers inland in a giant tsunami.",
    "And, with nothing to stop them, the winds would sweep around the earth,...",
    "...whipping it up into a giant storm.",
    "In short, our planet would not fare well."
