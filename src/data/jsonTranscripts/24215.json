    "How do you describe your mother?",
    "You know, what's she like?",
    "My mother is like an example of how to live your life to the fullest.",
    "She's bright.",
    "And not just smart, I mean, she's bright.",
    "She's like sunshine, like all the time.",
    "How often do you tell her how you feel?",
    "I don't think I've actually said the words \"I love you\" to my mom in a long time.",
    "She knows I love her, that goes without question.",
    "I would like her to know that I feel it's my duty to make sure...",
    "...she sees everything she wants to see in this life.",
    "And enjoys herself as much as humanly possible."
