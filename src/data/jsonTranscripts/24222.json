    "In an age of technology and progress, why do we persevere with the flawed umbrella?",
    "Come in from the rain, close the umbrella, you've got a wet floor.",
    "This is just one of the many problems with the current umbrella design.",
    "The patented mechanism we've developed encloses the wet canopy on the inside,...",
    "...leaving the dry side to handle.",
    "And it does this without compromising on the umbrella's familiar look and usability.",
    "Finally, after years of research and development, we bring the Kazbrella first...",
    "...to you on Kickstart.",
    "Coming in from the rain, you simply close the Kazbrella,...",
    "...just as you would a normal umbrella.",
    "And then, you're drip-free, home and dry."
