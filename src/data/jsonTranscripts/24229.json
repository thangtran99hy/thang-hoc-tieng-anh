    "Dear diary, the authorities have removed the pair of black pants from the couch.",
    "There is no longer any place for me to sleep.",
    "I have vomited three times in protest...",
    "...but there is no sign that anything will change.",
    "My only other hope for rest is on the computer keyboard, which is nearby...",
    "...but sadly, no one is currently using it.",
    "I will wait.",
    "Dear diary, my food dish is now only half full.",
    "It is obvious that I will soon starve to death.",
    "I have repeatedly tried to draw attention to my predicament...",
    "...but the authorities but they're clearly either stupid, deaf or just cruel.",
    "This may be my last entry."
