    "Most people are choosing pole dancing.",
    "Then you get a picture like this, which you share with your friends.",
    "You can move on in creating MyIdol images with famous pictures too.",
    "Of course, the 1D fandom is loving this app...",
    "...that lets them be the puppet masters of their favorite boy band.",
    "Louis is dancing like a female pop star from the 90s...",
