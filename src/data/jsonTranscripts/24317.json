    "Long ago, we looked upon a foreboding sky.",
    "The memory of the star that threatened all burns eternal in our hearts.",
    "In its wake came an age of silence.",
    "But after the long calm, there are now the beginnings of a stir.",
    "The reunion at hand may bring joy, it may bring fear,...",
    "...but let us embrace whatever it brings.",
    "For they are coming back.",
    "At last, the promise has been made."
