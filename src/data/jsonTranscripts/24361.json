    "I first decided I would like to have a music career when I was about 14.",
    "And I remember I thought I could probably get a record deal in a year.",
    "That was what I thought.",
    "It takes a year, it's pretty easy.",
    "And I thought, all I had to do is see my potential.",
    "So, I'll record three songs and I'll send this three-song demo to a label.",
    "I'll send it to every label and one of them will pick me.",
    "That's what I thought in my insane mind when I was 14...",
    "...and I thought that would be a great idea,...",
    "...but I didn't get a record deal until I was 22, so it took a lot longer.",
    "But I had big dreams."
