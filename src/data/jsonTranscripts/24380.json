    "Today, I'm gonna show you a great way to serve a watermelon.",
    "And we're gonna start by using a sharp knife to cut it in half.",
    "Rather than just cutting off a slice like this, which can be messy and awkward to eat,...",
    "...we're going to turn half the melon over onto a chopping board.",
    "Then, using our knife, cut strips about an inch wide all the way up the watermelon like this.",
    "Next, we're gonna turn it around and do exactly the same again.",
    "Try and hold the melon altogether while you're doing it.",
    "And there we have it: simple and ready to serve.",
    "Just pull a piece out and it's ready to eat.",
    "Great for parties and sharing with friends."
