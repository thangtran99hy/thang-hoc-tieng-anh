    "I am a flower.",
    "Yes, I'm beautiful.",
    "I've heard it before.",
    "And it never grows old.",
    "I'm worshipped for my looks, my scent, my looks.",
    "But here's the thing.",
    "Life starts with me.",
    "You see, I feed people.",
    "Every fruit comes from me.",
    "Every potato, me.",
    "Every kernel of corn, me.",
    "Every grain of rice, me.",
    "Me, me, me, I know, but it's true.",
    "And sometimes I feed their souls.",
    "I am their words when they have none.",
    "I say \"I love you\" without a sound.",
    "\"I'm sorry\" without a voice.",
    "I inspire the greatest of them.",
    "Painters, poets, pattern makers, I've been a muse to them all.",
    "But in my experience, people underestimate the power of a pretty little flower.",
    "Because their life does start with me.",
    "And it could end without me."
