    "So we got one question that we wanna ask you today.",
    "Okay, well... what's that question?",
    "The question is: If you could change one thing about your body, what would it be?",
    "Only one?",
    "I would change my forehead.",
    "I have a really big forehead.",
    "I'd like to be taller.",
    "The puffiness of my face.",
    "My ears.",
    "I have big ears.",
    "Stretch marks after having a baby.",
    "Can you sit on the chair?",
    "No.",
    "Alright, I want to ask you one question.",
    "What's the question?",
    "If you could change one thing about your body, what would you change?",
    "You know, have a mermaid tail.",
    "Probably like a shark mouth so I could eat a lot of stuff.",
    "If I could have teleportation in my body.",
    "Extra pointy ears.",
    "I want legs like a cheetah so I can run faster like a cheetah.",
    "I could have wings so I can fly.",
    "I don't think there's anything to change.",
    "I like my body actually.",
    "Yeah, you wouldn't change anything?",
    "Nothing else.",
    "Just a mermaid tail."
