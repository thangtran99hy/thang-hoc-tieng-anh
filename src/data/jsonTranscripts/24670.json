    "Welcome to the Scorch!",
    "The world outside is hanging on by a very thin thread.",
    "Beyond this door lies the beginning of your new lives.",
    "I remember watching my friends die in front of me.",
    "Don't you want to understand?",
    "Understand what?",
    "Why this all happened?",
    "I just need to know, whose side are you on?",
    "They're hiding something.",
    "Come on, you don't know that!",
    "They lied to us.",
    "We never escaped.",
    "It's all just been part of their plan.",
    "What do they want from us?",
    "Thomas!",
    "The Maze is one thing.",
    "But you kids won't last one day out in the Scorch."
