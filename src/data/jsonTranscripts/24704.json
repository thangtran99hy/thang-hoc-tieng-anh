    "The Internet needs a refresher course on words and what they mean.",

    "Let's start with \"they're.\"",
    "\"They're\" is a contraction of two words.",
    "So it can only mean one thing: they are.",
    "So if you break the words apart in a sentence and it doesn't make sense,...",
    "...he is going over they are?",
    "Try again.",
    "Okay, so this leaves \"there\" and \"their.\"",
    "\"There\" is a place.",
    "Here's an easy way to remember it.",
    "Here, there.",
    "Wait, where?",
    "Yeah, that's a good way to remember it too.",
    "What?",
    "Stop it.",
    "Why?",
    "So the only one left is \"their,\"...",
    "...which means it's this.",
    "Yeah, think for a second to make sure you're using the right one.",
    "You will learn this in the third grade, dummy!",
    "Don't say that!",
    "Why?"
