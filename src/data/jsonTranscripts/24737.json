    "Now, my friends always tell me that a Japanese...",
    "...is really good at balancing tradition and modernity.",
    "So today, we would like to see whether this is true or not.",
    "And our first stop will be Senso-ji.",
    "So we're now at Senso-ji.",
    "It's one of the oldest temples in Tokyo,...",
    "...and dates back to 1,400 years ago.",
    "So to my upper right, you see a big, red lantern.",
    "You can't leave a temple without trying some local food.",
    "So we are now on our way to try out some tasty snacks.",
    "Are you ready?",
    "Ningyo-yaki. These are Japanese traditional sweets, and I'm trying it now.",
    "Oh, it's packed.",
    "Look at this thing.",
    "Actually, there are a variety of shapes,...",
    "...so it's fun to discover different types of shapes.",
    "How does it taste like?",
    "I like this, it's really nice.",
    "What's inside? Can you show it to me?",
    "Yeah.",
    "So I see there's red beans.",
    "Yeah, it's filled with anko, which is sweet, smooth red bean paste.",
    "And I like it so please try it.",
    "It's popular in Asakusa.",
    "Oh, this is funny.",
    "Before entering the temple,...",
    "...we saw a boy trying to get the smoke of incense onto his head.",
    "This is a spirit cleansing ritual, I guess.",
    "In the temple, we did a prayer in Buddhist style.",
    "You know, when you're in Rome, you gotta do what the Romans do."
