    "Hey guys. So I probably should've made this video...",
    "...before I went mixing in apples for about three weeks.",
    "But the reason I haven't posted in a while is because,...",
    "...well, there's actually three reasons why.",
    "The first reason is because I recently just got back from Singapore and Malaysia...",
    "...because I had a couple of shows.",
    "It looked something like this.",
    "The second reason is pretty obvious.",
    "I'm sure you guys can hear it but I got pretty sick on that trip.",
    "And it looks something like this.",
    "And finally, last but not least,...",
    "...the third reason is because well, I'm filming a movie!",
    "Listen to my voice.",
    "Let me do another take.",
    "The last reason is because I'm filming a movie,...",
    "...since you couldn't understand what I just said.",
    "That's right, I'm a freaking mainstream Hollywood movie star now.",
    "Well I mean, I'm not exactly the star of the film...",
    "...so I guess you can't really call me a movie star.",
    "And it's not exactly mainstream because it's an independent film.",
    "And it's not even shot in Hollywood.",
    "It's shot in Downtown LA.",
    "But it's still a real movie, okay.",
    "And I'm still a real movie star, okay.",
    "I had so many lines, it looked just like this.",
    "No buttons, guess they really don't want us to leave.",
    "Who'd wanna leave?",
    "I'm a movie star."
