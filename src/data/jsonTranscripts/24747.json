    "Why are our fingerprints unique and what is their purpose?",
    "Fingerprints don't change as you age.",
    "They stand the test of time and are actually pretty dang durable.",
    "One man named Haans Galassi lost a few fingers in a wakeboarding accident.",
    "One of his fingers was identified in a trout...",
    "...months later by using fingerprinting technology.",
    "And you leave your fingerprints...",
    "....on just about anything that you come in contact with throughout the day:...",
    "...glasses, tables, door handles.",
    "The oils and sweat in your hands create the print.",
    "With the right solution, you can actually identify the fingerprint...",
    "...and trace it back to whoever left it.",
    "It sure does come in handy when police are looking for criminals.",
    "You get it?",
    "Handy, hands?",
    "Sorry.",
    "Well, now you know their purpose but why are they unique to you?",
    "Fingerprints are created in the womb by a random combination of stem cells...",
    "...into \"ridge\" type cells and \"valley\" type cells.",
    "The randomness of heat and chemical diffusion...",
    "...creates the pattern before you're even born.",
    "And unless you cut off your fingertips completely, they're not going anywhere."
