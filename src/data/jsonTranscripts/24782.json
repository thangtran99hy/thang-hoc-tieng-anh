    "If I have to take one more picture of that disgusting baby,...",
    "...I swear, I'm gonna drop myself in the toilet.",
    "I know exactly what you mean.",
    "I just want one night.",
    "One night where I get to go out and take a picture with my front-facing camera.",
    "Right?",
    "One night where I get to autocorrect swear words.",
    "Yeah!",
    "One night when the dirty puddle I get dropped in doesn't come out of a freaking diaper!",
    "You were dropped into a diaper?",
    "And honestly, I'd be fine with all of this...",
    "..if she'd just take the effort to back me up just once.",
    "She doesn't back you up?",
    "I know, right?",
    "It's like she hates technology.",
    "Because all I need is one bad day and boom!",
    "Boom!",
    "All those memories are gone.",
    "And I am nothing but a baby picture taking machine.",
    "And who is she gonna blame?",
    "You!",
    "Me!",
    "That sucks!",
    "I know! I am sorry, I don't know why I get like this,...",
    "...probably just too many apps open.",
    "Oh muffin, that's okay.",
    "But seriously, you were dropped in a diaper?",
    "I have seen things, friend."
