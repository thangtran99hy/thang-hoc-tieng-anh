    "Mark Zuckerberg has finally announced that the homies over at Facebook...",
    "...have indeed been working on a dislike button.",
    "He cited events like the recent refugee crisis...",
    "...or posts that users make about family members who have passed away...",
    "...to give examples of incidents where friends want to show that they care,...",
    "...but it's not like they \"like\" what is going on.",
    "Instead of showing disapproval,...",
    "...the dislike button will be more like saying \"I'm sorry\"."
