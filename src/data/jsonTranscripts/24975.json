    "The first ever atomic bomb to be used in war was dropped here on the city of Hiroshima...",
    "...on the 6th of August 1945.",
    "Well over 100,000 citizens were killed.",
    "Those in the hypocenter were instantly turned into dust,...",
    "...while countless others died from the burns and high dose of radiation they received.",
    "Over 50,000 survivors or \"hibakusha\" still live in the city.",
    "Each one of them has their own story to tell of the day the bomb fell.",
    "And I was on my way to meet one."
