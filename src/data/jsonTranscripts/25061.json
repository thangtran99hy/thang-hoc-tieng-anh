    "Eastern Europe in the 18th century was a pretty grim place,...",
    "...with many deaths occurring from unknown diseases and plagues.",
    "Without medical explanations, people searched for supernatural causes...",
    "...and found what looked like evidence in the corpses of the victims.",
    "When villagers dug up bodies to discern the cause of the mysterious deaths,...",
    "...they would often find the cadavers looking very much alive.",
    "Longer hair and fingernails, bloated bellies, and blood at the corners of mouths.",
    "Grisly stuff!",
    "But what the villagers interpreted as unholy reanimation...",
    "...were actually normal symptoms of death."
