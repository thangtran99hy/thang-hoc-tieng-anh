    "Why do we play?",
    "We play for jumpers, passers and shooters.",
    "We play for driveway one-on-ones, playground heroes and the clutch vet at the Y.",
    "We play for ballers, shot callers, game changers, life changers.",
    "We play for the East side, West side, North side and South side.",
    "We play for the drama, the suspense and even the comedy.",
    "We play for comebacks, paybacks and givebacks.",
    "For breaking through, breaking barriers and paradigms.",
    "We play for chasing the dream, on and off the court.",
    "We play for all that and whatever comes.",
    "This is why we play."
