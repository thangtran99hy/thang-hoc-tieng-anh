    "Every day we experience the world through touch.",
    "It saves us time in the morning.",
    "It's how we use most of our technology.",
    "And it comes to us naturally even if it's just to play or explore.",
    "Touch removes barriers and allows us to truly interact.",
    "So, why do these barriers exist in the classroom?",
    "A pen can be a great tool,...",
    "...but it doesn't allow you to truly interact with content.",
    "Only a touch-enabled interactive projector can.",
    "Introducing the world's first touch-enabled Interactive Projector."
