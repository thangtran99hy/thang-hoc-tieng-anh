    "After many failed attempts trying to swat them,...",
    "...I started to realize how amazing the fruit fly's escape is.",
    "I had been reading about flying robots at the time, and one thing that struck me...",
    "...was the similarities in the environments in which both fruit flies...",
    "...and flying robots have to operate.",
    "I wanted to see whether we could draw from biology...",
    "...to make flying robots truly autonomous,...",
    "...so they could potentially be used in robot-assisted rescue missions...",
    "...in environments like collapsed buildings.",
