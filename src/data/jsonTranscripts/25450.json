    "Well, I appreciate your interest in wanting to be a Fort Worth police officer.",
    "What makes you think you're qualified?",
    "If you could see on my resume, I have ruled over the Imperial Force for sometime.",
    "It had great success in ruling the galaxies.",
    "What is this about a Death Star blowing up under your command?",
    "I was cleared of that.",
    "Not my fault.",
    "You can see per my resume, I'm quite proficient at using the Force.",
    "Well, we refer to it as use of force...",
    "...and I don't think that's quite the same thing you think it is.",
    "Also, we require our recruits to pass a physical assessment test...",
    "...and quite honestly, you sound like you have a deep breathing issue.",
    "Do you think that's gonna be a problem?",
    "You don't have to worry about my breathing because I can disarm a suspect...",
    "...without having to chase him.",
    "How can you do that?",
    "Give me that.",
    "Okay, I think we're done here.",
    "You want to hire me.",
    "What?",
    "I am the recruit you are looking for.",
    "Okay.",
    "Thanks for your time, we'll let you know.",
    "Do you, by chance, validate?",
    "Please leave."
