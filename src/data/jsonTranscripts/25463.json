    "Everybody loves apples.",
    "An apple is a smooth, shiny, round fruit with the top and bottom pushed in.",
    "It is green when it's raw but a deep red when it's ripe.",
    "It tastes tangy and sweet normally.",
    "It has a few seeds in the middle which are thrown away.",
    "If you haven't eaten an apple so far, folks, you have missed something in life."
