    "To me, there's nothing like a desert sunrise and a desert sunset.",
    "And it makes life beautiful and bearable.",
    "I would describe the desert as home.",
    "I love the desert.",
    "I was born in the desert.",
    "And it's great to be in these remote places,...",
    "...but I love to stay plugged into what's going on with my family,...",
    "...what's going on with my friends.",
    "I'm off the grid without being off the grid."
