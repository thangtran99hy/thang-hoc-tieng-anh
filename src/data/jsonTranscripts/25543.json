    "For many Canadians like eight-year-old Maya Ray, it's kind of a ritual:...",
    "...winding down and curling up with a good book.",

    "I get upset at her.",
    "I'm like, \"Maya! Stop reading in the dark!\"",

    "I hear it all the time.",
    "His answer may surprise you.",
    "It's best to get the lights to be bright.",
    "It just makes reading easier,...",

    "And Omega-3s, things like fish, nuts and green leafy vegetables, are great for your eyes.",
    "And while reading in dim light isn't necessarily harmful,...",
    "...I would tell moms to get a good light in their kid's rooms for sure.",
    "It doesn't hurt."
