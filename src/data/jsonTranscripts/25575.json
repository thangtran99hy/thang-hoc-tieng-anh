    "Dance is a very big part of my life.",
    "I took my first dance class when I was four.",
    "It just makes me feel good doing what I actually love to do.",
    "It takes up a lot of time but I'd much rather do that than do anything else.",
    "I think having a little girl is going to turn out to be more different as time goes on.",
    "And I hope that she continues to love her dad and not be embarrassed by her parents.",
    "And I hope she doesn't think that I work too much...",
    "...or don't pay enough attention to her...",
    "...because I really do value the time we spend together.",
    "As a parent, you find yourself doing crazy things for your kids.",
    "We wouldn't have it any other way.",
    "They won't be kids forever which makes today that much more important."
