    "Hi everyone!",
    "Welcome!",
    "Today, I'm gonna talk about how to train your dog and it's a very important lesson.",
    "So, pay attention everybody.",
    "With me today is my dog Kitsu.",
    "She is a Shiba Inu.",
    "Isn't she adorable?",
    "Hi Kitsu!",
    "The first thing that you have to know about training your dog...",
    "...is that you are the master...",
    "...and the dog has to listen to you.",
    "In order to show that you are the master,...",
    "...you have to stand straight and talk in a commanding voice like this.",
    "Kitsu, up!",
    "And you also have to give the dog rewards when they're doing good.",
    "And that's called positive reinforcement."
