    "When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad or our fellow citizens,...",
    "...when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid is called names,...",
    "...it doesn't make us safer.",
    "That's not telling it like it is.",
    "It's just wrong.",
    "It diminishes us in the eyes of the world.",
    "It makes it harder to achieve our goals.",
    "It betrays who we are as a country."
