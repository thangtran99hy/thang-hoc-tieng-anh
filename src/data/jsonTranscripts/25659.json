    "If you doubt America's commitment or mine to see that justice is done,...",
    "...just ask Osama Bin Laden.",
    "Ask the leader of Al-Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year.",
    "Or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell.",
    "When you come after Americans, we go after you.",
    "And it may take time, but we have long memories and our reach has no limits."
