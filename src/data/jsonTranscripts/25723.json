    "Hi, I'm looking for the shower.",
    "There are no showers here, ma'am.",
    "Well, I'm gonna look pretty silly dressed like this going to the bar.",
    "There's no bar here but we do have hot towels and a bag of peanuts.",
    "Emirates planes have showers and they have bars.",
    "Oh, this isn't an Emirates plane, ma'am.",
    "No, no, no.",
    "There's no shower and there's no bar?",
    "Why are you laughing like that?",
    "It was such a nightmare.",
    "I was on a plane and it was nothing like this.",
    "I'm sorry to hear that.",
    "Thank you so much.",
    "Hey, is there someone that we could talk to about maybe flying this around a little bit longer?",
    "Just like, an hour."
