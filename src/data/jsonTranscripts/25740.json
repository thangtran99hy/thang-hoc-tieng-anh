    "ï»¿The process of choosing a president formally begins with the primary election...",
    "...when each party chooses a nominee.",
    "During this process, each state holds its own vote called either a \"primary\" or a \"caucus.\"",
    "The first caucus is traditionally in Iowa.",
    "In a caucus, citizens gather in a public space to debate issues and share concerns.",
    "They then choose a candidate.",
    "The results from each district are then tallied...",
    "...to determine a statewide outcome.",
    "The first primary is in New Hampshire.",
    "A primary is like a regular election, where citizens cast ballots at a voting center.",
    "One important date is \"Super Tuesday,\" when lots of states vote on the same day.",
    "These state primaries and caucuses then continue until around mid-year.",
    "A winner usually emerges even before all the nominating contests are over.",
    "But it's not official until later at each party's national political convention."
