    "What can you do to be kind?",
    "Quite a few times, I let other people do something that they wanna do...",
    "...even though I didn't like it that much.",

    "...and I sit next to them and talk to them.",
    "And my grandpa's birthday is coming up...",

    "Don't say mean stuff to them and try not to hurt their feelings.",
    "God wants us to do that and it's the right thing."
