    "ï»¿When I go back to India, I feel at home.",
    "There's always a worry in the back of my head...",
    "...that this will be the last time I see my grandma.",
    "Every chance that I get, I want to cherish it.",
    "I was 12 when we moved, so I still have those memories of India.",
    "India is a beautiful chaos.",
    "In Canada, it's much more ordered.",
    "No matter how many years I've been away, home will always be India."
