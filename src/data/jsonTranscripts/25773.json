    "My favorite part of growing up in Scottburgh was just surfing and crowded point breaks.",
    "Every winter between May, June, July, we get some of the best waves that I've had in the world.",
    "Right now, I'm just focusing on the QS...",
    "...and I just wanna surf as hard as I can every day.",
    "That's what I want to do.",
    "I wanna go compete with those guys and travel the world...",
    "...and surf against the world's best surfers."
