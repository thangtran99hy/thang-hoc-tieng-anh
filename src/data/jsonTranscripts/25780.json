    "I started playing guitar when I was, I think, about eight years old.",
    "I wasn't super dedicated to it for a long time.",
    "When I joined School of Rock like, it kinda made me wanna practice more...",
    "...and I got to start performing and that was a lot more fun...",
    "...than just sitting at home doing nothing.",
    "The first time I performed was at Toby Keith's Bar and Grill.",
    "I only got to play one song.",
    "I got to play \"The Immigrant Song\" by Led Zeppelin and, I mean, I probably sucked.",
    "I just had a lot of fun with it and enjoyed it a lot.",
    "I sometimes get nervous if I'm playing in front of a bigger crowd.",
    "But normally it doesn't stress me out too much anymore.",
    "And a lot of shows can be really exciting."
