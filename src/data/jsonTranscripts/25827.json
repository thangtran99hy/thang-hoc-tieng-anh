    "ï»¿Nissan is offering a glimpse of its autonomous driving technology...",
    "...as applied to office chairs.",
    "Inspired by the company's self-parking technology for cars,....",
    "...these chairs respond to a handclap by returning to predetermined positions.",
    "Like self-parking cars, the chairs are guided by cameras that analyze their locations.",
    "Computers then remotely control rollers at the base of each chair.",
    "The technology can liberate people from the annoying task of returning chairs...",
    "...to their original positions, Nissan says.",
    "This is, however, only a concept...",
    "...and Nissan has no plans to make the guided chairs commercially available."
