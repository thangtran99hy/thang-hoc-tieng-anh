    "A hundred years ago, that would have been the magic of levitation.",
    "Is it possible to create illusions in a world...",
    "...where technology makes anything possible?",

    "If you know how the trick is done, where is the illusion?",
    "Here, boy!",
    "He can do a trick.",
    "Watch.",
    "Up!",

    "Come back!",
    "Very funny!",
    "Behave yourselves!",
    "As a magician, I have always known...",
    "...that the illusion is in the mind of the beholder.",
    "Once upon a time, this would have been magic.",
    "Today, it is a trick of technology.",
    "But still, our imagination is more powerful than our reasoning.",
    "And it's easy to attribute personality to machines."
