    "A calendar year is made of 365 days. It's supposed to match the solar year.",
    "But things aren't quite that simple.",
    "It actually takes Earth 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds to complete its orbit.",
    "Those extra hours gradually add up...",
    "...so that after four years, the calendar is out of step by about one day.",
    "Every four years, an extra day is added to the calendar,...",
    "...making the length of the year 366 days.",
    "Easy, right?",
    "The Egyptians were the first people to think of adding a leap day...",
    "...to the calendar every four years.",
    "Later, the Romans copied the idea."
