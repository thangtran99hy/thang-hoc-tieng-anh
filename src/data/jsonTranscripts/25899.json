    "A lot of people think that innovation is just having a great idea.",
    "But a lot of it is just moving quickly and trying a lot of things.",
    "So at Facebook, we've really built our whole company and our culture around this.",
    "We do things like ship code every single day.",
    "And we have this tradition of having hackathons,...",
    "...which are events where all of our engineers and really the whole company get together...",
    "...and stay up all night just building things,...",
    "...whatever they want, not what they're doing for work.",
    "Just trying things out and innovating."
