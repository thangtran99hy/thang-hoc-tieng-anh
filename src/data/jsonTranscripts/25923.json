    "...and today we're gonna check out the Samsung Gear 360,...",
    "...a new 360-degree camera that lets you capture your own VR content.",
    "Samsung's already got the Gear VR headset...",
    "...and now it's got a VR camera to go along with it.",
    "The Gear 360 is a tiny ball-shaped camera that fits in the palm of your hand.",
    "The splashproof camera has two fish-eye lenses...",
    "...that each capture video in 195 degrees.",
    "The videos are then stitched together into a 360-degree video...",
    "...using the power of the Galaxy S7.",
    "360-degree videos are saved to a micro SD card...",
    "...and can be wirelessly transferred to a Galaxy S7 smartphone...",
    "...for editing and sharing to Facebook, YouTube, etc.",
    "Final videos have a resolution of 3840 x 1920,...",
    "...and in my opinion, look quite good."
