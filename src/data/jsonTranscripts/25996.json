    "One method you could try is with a temporary tattoo.",
    "I'm starting with this plain white phone case...",
    "...and I'm going to put a stegosaurus tattoo on it.",
    "'Cause why would you not want a stegosaurus...",
    "...on your phone case?",
    "Following the instructions, I'm going to peel this off...",
    "...and then put it facedown on the case.",
    "And press it down with a wet paper towel for about 30 seconds.",
    "Then, remove the wet towel and gently peel...",
    "...the backing of the tattoo off.",
    "If there's any clear residue left over,...",
    "...you can wipe that off around the tattoo.",
    "I think this one turned out pretty nice.",
    "And there are some air bubbles.",
    "But they're so small that they're not really that noticeable.",

    "...because the material is really delicate.",
    "To make this tattoo permanent,...",
    "...you then want to spray it with a clear varnish."
