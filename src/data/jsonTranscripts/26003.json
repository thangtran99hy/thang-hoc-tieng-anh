    "You know, fashion came up to me quite late.",
    "And I never had the dream of being known through the world.",
    "But being a woman, I really take the world of pret-a-porter,...",
    "...ready-to-wear, literally.",
    "And it's true that for me,...",
    "...it's not about dressing a woman for a special occasion.",
    "It's more about, \"Okay, what do I wear this morning?\"",
    "It's easy to do a fancy dress that looks great...",
    "...but then you look at it and say, \"When am I going to wear that?\"",
    "The fashion world is looking for new things, amazing things,...",
    "...things that they haven't seen yet.",
    "And it's very difficult to combine a certain creativity...",
    "...with keeping in your mind that it's a kind of art...",
    "...but in the end, it's something that has a purpose."
