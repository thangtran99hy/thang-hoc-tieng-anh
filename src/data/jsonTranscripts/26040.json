    "Me and Jack met on the North Shore, O'ahu last year.",
    "And I kinda was like, a little hesitant at first...",
    "...because I just never thought I would date a pro surfer.",
    "He's so supportive in all, my job, stuff.",
    "He's just the greatest, he's so sweet and just a really good guy.",
    "We both love to just surf and be active and healthy,...",
    "...just kind of, I don't know, just goof around and just have fun.",
    "He's a really good surfer.",
    "It's almost like I feel bad while surfing 'cause he's so good."
