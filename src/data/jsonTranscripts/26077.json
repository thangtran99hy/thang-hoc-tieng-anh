    "Tell me what you know about Easter.",
    "It's about Jesus.",
    "What does Jesus have to do with Easter?",
    "One time, I heard this in a movie it said that Easter was about hope.",
    "Jesus does wonderful things for people.",
    "He died on the cross for our sin...",
    "...so no more bad things will happen to us or no more things.",
    "They just hanged Jesus up because they didn't like Jesus.",
    "Some soldiers nailed Jesus to the cross...",
    "...and bled everywhere until he died."
