    "Nice to meet you, where you've been? I could show you incredible things.",
    "Magic, madness, heaven, sin.",
    "Saw you there and I thought, \"Oh my God, look at that face.\"",
    "\"You look like my next mistake.\"",
    "Love's a game, wanna play?",
    "New money, suit and tie, I can read you like a magazine.",
    "Ain't it funny, rumors fly and I know you heard about me.",
    "So hey, let's be friends. I'm dying to see how this one ends.",
    "Grab your passport and my hand.",
    "I can make the bad guys good for a weekend.",
    "So, it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames.",
    "You can tell me when it's over, if the high was worth the pain.",
    "Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane.",
    "'Cause you know I love the players and you love the game.",
    "'Cause we're young and we're reckless, we'll take this way too far.",
    "It'll leave you breathless or with a nasty scar.",
    "Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane.",
    "But I've got a blank space, baby.",
    "And I'll write your name."
