    "A whole new world,...",
    "...a dazzling place I never knew.",
    "But when I'm way up here, it's crystal clear...",
    "...that now I'm in a whole new world with you.",
    "And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon.",
    "For whether we are white or copper-skinned,...",
    "...we need to sing with all the voices of the mountains.",
    "We need to paint with all the colors of the wind.",
    "Who is that girl I see staring straight back at me?",
    "Why is my reflection someone I don't know?",
    "How do you know he loves you?",
    "How do you know he's yours?",
    "Well does he leave a little note to tell you you are on his mind?",
    "Send you yellow flowers when the sky is gray?",
    "That's how you know.",
    "That's how you know he's your love."
