    "Back when I was a child,...",
    "...before life removed all the innocence,...",
    "...my father would lift me high...",
    "...and dance with my mother and me...",
    "...and then, spin me around 'til I fell asleep.",
    "Then up the stairs he would carry me.",
    "And I knew for sure, I was loved.",
    "If I could get another chance, another walk, another dance with him,...",
    "...I'd play a song that would never ever end.",
    "How I'd love...",
    "...to dance with my father again."
