    "Today, we're going to do the egg in a bottle experiment.",
    "Here's what you'll need:...",
    "...a hard-boiled egg, a wide mouth bottle, a piece of paper, some matches or a lighter.",
    "First, peel your hard-boiled egg.",
    "Notice how the egg will not fall inside the bottle.",
    "Then, ask your parent to light your piece of paper, then put it inside the bottle.",
    "Then, quickly put your egg over top.",
    "When the paper is inside the bottle, the air inside heats up.",
    "When you put the egg over top, the flame goes out and the air starts to cool down.",
    "As the air inside contracts, the air outside pushes the egg into the bottle.",
    "And there you have it, the egg in a bottle."
