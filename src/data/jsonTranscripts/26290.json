    "Hi everyone! I'm Lang Lang and I was born in China.",
    "My first music experience was watching cartoons...",
    "...and one of my favorite characters was Tom the cat.",
    "Tom and Jerry but I've always liked Tom a little bit more...",
    "...because he's more silly so, somehow he's better.",
    "I started to play piano at the age of three.",
    "My first teacher was my father but he was not very good.",
    "After a year, I actually demanded to change to a better teacher.",
    "So when I was four, I started to really study, like kind of professionally.",
    "I practiced two hours a day or three hours.",
    "I made my first recital right after winning my first competition at the age of five.",
    "That recital really made me have a, kind of a dream...",
    "...to become a pianist...",
    "...because I thought being on stage feels pretty amazingly natural...",
    "...and I feel very satisfied and I really love to share music to the audience."
