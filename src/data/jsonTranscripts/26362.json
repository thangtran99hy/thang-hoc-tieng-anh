    "What's the one line from the Harry Potter movies...",
    "...that still resonates with you?",
    "Of course it's happening in your head...",
    "...but why does that mean it's not real?",
    "Is this all real?",
    "Or is it just happening inside my head?",
    "Of course it's happening inside your head, Harry.",
    "Why should that mean that it's not real?",
    "I love that.",
    "I feel like that's a perfect one for anyone who is an artist...",
    "...or who is in the arts.",
    "Like, the fact that you can have things in your head...",
    "...and imagine them and if you believe in them hard enough,....",
    "...you can make a movie or a book or something."
