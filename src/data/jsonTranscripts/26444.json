    "Las Vegas is situated in the United States in the western state of Nevada.",
    "Rising like an oasis from the Mojave desert,...",
    "...this city of over a million people enjoys 300 days of sunshine a year.",
    "Hey buddy, would you pass me the suntan lotion?",
    "If ever there was a city that shouldn't be, it's Las Vegas.",
    "Starting life is a windswept watering hole on the pioneer trail.",
    "This is a city that continually beat the odds.",
    "Over the decades, Las Vegas grew into a kind of neon Camelot...",
    "...whose casinos and rat pack style has become almost legendary.",
    "But if your ideas about Las Vegas looked like an old Super 8 movie,...",
    "...prepare to be blown away;...",
    "...and I mean really blown away."
