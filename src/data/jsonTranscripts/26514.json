    "I found myself dreaming in silver and gold,...",
    "...like a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows.",
    "We were walking on moonlight and I pulled you close.",
    "Split second and you disappeared and then I was all alone.",
    "I woke up in tears with you by my side.",
    "A breath of relief and I realized.",
    "No, we're not promised tomorrow.",
    "So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you.",
    "I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye.",
    "Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted...",
    "...'cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time.",
    "So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you.",
    "I'm gonna hold you like I'm gonna lose you, babe."
