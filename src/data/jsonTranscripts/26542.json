    "...suggested that I think about how much worse things could be.",
    "This was completely counterintuitive to me.",

    "...not just on the easy days like today,...",
    "...but on the hard days when you will need it.",
    "You are not born with a fixed amount of resilience.",

    "And in that process, you figure out who you really are,...",
    "...and you just might become the very best version of yourself."
