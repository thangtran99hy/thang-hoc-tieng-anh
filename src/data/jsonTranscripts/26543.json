    "When I was born, doctors said I had a condition that affected every part of me,",
    "from my body to my brain.",
    "When you're like me, people don't always give you a chance.",
    "They put me in a different school.",
    "They put me in a different team.",
    "They talked to me in a different way...",
    "...but I never wanted to be treated any differently.",
    "I wanted to be independent, so I learned to drive.",
    "I love sports, so I took part in any way I could.",
    "When my condition became so bad, I lost feeling in my legs.",
    "I learned to walk again.",
    "And when I wanted to work, I got a job.",
    "It's a struggle every day...",
    "...but I still get up because work makes me feel that I'm reaching my goals.",
    "I'm part of a team.",
    "And I get to give back to my family.",
    "My whole life people have been telling me I have a learning disability.",
    "I guess they're right because I have never learned how to give up."
