    "I led Overwatch for 20 years.",
    "People used to call me a hero.",
    "Those were the good old days.",
    "They didn't last.",
    "People decided they were better off without us.",
    "They even called us criminals!",
    "Why would you do this?",
    "They tore our family apart.",
    "The world is changing once again and it's time to pick a side.",
    "But look around!",
    "Someone has to do something!",
    "We have to do something!",
    "What are you looking at?",
    "Trying to crash another party, love?",
    "You don't get off that easy.",
    "We can make a difference again.",
    "The world needs us now...",
    "...more than ever!",
    "Are you with me?"
