    "Oliver takes out the trash.",
    "Awesome.",
    "This Plink let's you see everything.",
    "Hey, who put all that trash there?",
    "That's disgusting.",
    "Okay, bags and biceps let's do it.",
    "I mean what doofus would throw this stuff into a river.",
    "Isn't that your lunch bag?",
    "Ah yeah, but I didn't throw this in the river, I threw it in the trash.",
    "That's not for trash Ollie, that's an air vent it goes to the river.",
    "Aw man, I'm the doofus...",
    "...but still how did my stuff get all the way downstream?",
    "Water moves, remember?",
    "So, anything you drop up here will eventually land down there.",
    "Right! Okay, from now on, I'm gonna be careful where I throw stuff."
