    "ï»¿Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup.",
    "They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.",
    "Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind...",
    "...possessing and caressing me.",
    "Nothing's gonna change my world.",
    "Nothing's gonna change my world."
