    "I've always had that dream, like my daddy before me.",
    "So I started writing songs, I started writing stories.",
    "Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me.",
    "'Cause only those I truly love will ever really know me.",
    "Once I was 20 years old, my story got told.",
    "Before the morning sun, when life was lonely.",
    "Once I was 20 years old.",
    "I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure.",
    "'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major.",
    "I got my boys with me, at least those in favor.",
    "And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later.",
    "Once I was 20 years old, my story got told.",
    "I was writing about everything I saw before me.",
    "Once I was 20 years old."
