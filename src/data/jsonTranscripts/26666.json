    "Happy Father's Day, breakfast in bed!",
    "Oh wow, thank you!",
    "No problem.",
    "So, I was thinking, for Father's Day I thought it would be a great idea...",
    "...for you to hang out and spend the whole day with your son.",
    "Really?",
    "Yeah, what's a better way to spend Father's Day than being a father?",
    "I mean, yeah, that sounds like fun.",
    "Great, I'm gonna get the diaper bag.",
    "David?",
    "What are you doing here?",
    "My wife said it'd be a good idea to hang out with my daughter all day.",
    "My wife said the same thing about my son.",
    "That's weird.",
    "Okay, go to the park, baby.",
    "Hey, isn't that Tanner?",
    "It is Tanner.",
    "And that's Mark and his kids.",
    "Wait a minute.",
    "Best Father's Day ever."
