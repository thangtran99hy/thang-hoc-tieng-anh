    "Hello Bobby! What's wrong?",
    "Are your tires flat?",
    "Are your windows broken?",
    "Have your lights stopped working?",
    "What do you think is wrong with Bobby?",
    "It sounds like your fuel tank is nearly empty.",
    "Shall we give you a top-up?",
    "Fill, fill, fill, let's fill up your tank.",
    "For all of this fuel, I'm sure you'll thank.",
    "Let's fix that light that was so dim.",
    "Full, full, full, full to the brim!",
    "There! All filled up and ready to go.",
    "Bye-bye Bobby! See you again soon!"
