    "In the well-known but now lesser-used 4-4-2 or \"flat four\" system,...",
    "...midfielders operate in the corridors...",
    "...when they get possession to pass the ball on to the two forwards.",
    "It can also be played in a diamond formation...",
    "...with one midfielder in front of the defense and another supporting the forwards.",
    "World-class playmakers like Pelé, Maradona and Zidane express themselves best...",
    "...in the flexible 4-2-3-1 system,...",
    "...setting up attacks from the middle of the line of three.",
    "Teams that opt for the 4-1-4-1 formation are more defensive.",
    "The aim is to neutralize the game and creativity of the opposition...",
    "...while launching counterattacks.",
