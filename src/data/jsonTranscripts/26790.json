    "Jack fell down and broke his crown, and Jill came tumbling after.",
    "Then up got Jack and said to Jill, as in his arms he took her,...",

    "...to old Dame Dob, who patched his nob with vinegar and brown paper.",

    "Her mother whipped her across her knee for laughing at Jack's disaster."
