    "When your legs don't work like they used to before...",
    "...and I can't sweep you off of your feet,...",
    "...will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?",
    "Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?",
    "And darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70.",
    "And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23.",
    "And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways,...",
    "...maybe just the touch of a hand.",
    "Well me, I fall in love with you every single day...",
    "...and I just wanna tell you I am.",
    "So honey now,...",
    "...take me into your loving arms.",
    "Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars.",
    "Place your head on my beating heart.",
    "I'm thinking out loud.",
    "Maybe we found love right where we are."
