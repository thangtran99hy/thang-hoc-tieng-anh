    "I've been called the \"supermodel of hands.\"",
    "I think it's because I've had the longest career of any hand model out there.",
    "In those little seven inches,...",
    "...I have to convey a whole feeling, a whole story, a whole thought process...",
    "...about what's going into that advertising campaign.",
    "I wear gloves quite often, especially when I'm outside,...",
    "...to protect my hands from the elements...",
    "...and from things that can happen, but I take really good care of them,...",
    "...and you'll see why I'm a hand model.",
    "Because I have flawless skin and nice, long nails and very graceful hands,...",
    "...and that's really become my signature.",
    "I never know when I'm gonna have a hand modeling job.",
    "So, I could get called now and have to be somewhere in an hour.",
    "So, my hands always have to be ready to go."
