    "ï»¿You may write me down in history...",
    "...with your bitter, twisted lies.",
    "You may trod me in the very dirt...",
    "...but still, like dust, I rise.",
    "Just like moons and like suns,...",
    "...with the certainty of tides,...",
    "...just like hopes springing high,...",
    "...still I rise.",
    "Did you want to see me broken,...",
    "...bowed head and lowered eyes?",
    "Shoulders falling down like teardrops,...",
    "...weaned by my soulful cries.",
    "Out of the huts of history's shame, I rise.",
    "Up from a past that's rooted in pain, I rise.",
    "I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,...",
    "...welling and swelling I bear in the tide.",
    "Leaving behind nights of terror and fear, I rise."
