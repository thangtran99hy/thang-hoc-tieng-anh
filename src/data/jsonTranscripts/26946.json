    "ï»¿Hiya, Larry!",
    "It looks like you're carrying too many packages...",
    "...and they haven't been loaded very well.",
    "Shall we take a look?",
    "Go, go, mechanicals!",
    "What a mess, I'm really sorry.",
    "But that's no way to pack a lorry.",
    "Let's take some time and care with it.",
    "I'm sure we'll make these boxes fit.",
    "The biggest parcel should go in first.",
    "Put the smallest one on top.",
    "That blue parcel on the left.",
    "And the red one on the right.",
    "Let's put this parcel in the gap up at the top.",
    "And put the last parcel in that gap down at the bottom.",
    "There!",
    "All sorted.",
    "Now that everything is packed away neatly, it all fits in properly."
