    "Tonight I can write the saddest lines,...",

    "...\"the night is shattered and the blue stars shiver in a distance.\"",
    "\"The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.\"",
    "Tonight I can write the saddest lines.",
    "I loved her and sometimes, she loved me too.",
    "Through nights like this one, I held her in my arms.",
    "I kissed her again and again under the yellow sky.",
    "She loved me and sometimes, I loved her too.",
    "How could one not have loved her great, still eyes?",
    "Tonight I can write the saddest lines.",
    "To think that I do not have her,...",
    "...to feel that I have lost her,...",
    "...to hear the immense night, still more immense without her,...",
    "...and the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture."
