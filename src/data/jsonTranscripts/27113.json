    "This is our Third Annual Superhero Window Washer Day.",
    "So, our window washers dress in superhero costumes...",
    "...and they clean the windows for our kids.",
    "Some of our kids are here for long periods of time.",
    "They can be in the hospital for weeks or months,...",
    "...and it gives our kids the opportunity to forget that they are a patient in the hospital.",
    "It gives them an opportunity to come out on the terrace and just feel like a kid again."
