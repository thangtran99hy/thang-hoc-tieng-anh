    "Do you ever feel like a plastic bag,...",
    "...drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?",
    "Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin...",
    "...like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?",
    "Do you ever feel already buried deep six feet under screams...",
    "...when no one seems to hear a thing?",
    "Do you know that there's still a chance for you 'cause there's a spark in you.",
    "You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine.",
    "Just own the night like the 4th of July.",
    "Baby, you're a firework.",
    "Come on, show them what you're worth.",
    "Make them go, \"Ah, ah, ah\"...",
    "...as you shoot across the sky.",
    "Baby, you're a firework.",
    "Come on, let your colors burst.",
    "Make them go, \"Ah, ah, ah\".",
    "You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe."
