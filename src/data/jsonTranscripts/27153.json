    "ï»¿For a year of my life, I lived in a cabin in the woods...",
    "...without any running water, plumbing or electricity.",
    "I sang opera for five years.",
    "I can sing in Italian, German and French.",
    "I have six tattoos.",
    "They all have meaning to me...",
    "...and they remind me every day of what matters most in life.",
    "I once swallowed my tongue piercing and I owned a 9mm gun.",
    "When I was a kid, I was a competitive arm wrestler...",
    "...and spent my Sundays dirt biking through the woods.",
    "I have around 15 tattoos.",
    "I've kinda stopped counting...",
    "...but I really enjoy it because it's a cool way...",
    "...to commemorate certain parts of my life permanently on my body."
