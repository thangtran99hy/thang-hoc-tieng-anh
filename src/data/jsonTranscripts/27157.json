    "Cat lovers' dreams have come true...",
    "...in the small fishing village of Aoshima in Japan,...",
    "...where cats outnumber the human inhabitants by six to one.",
    "This tiny island is home to only 22 people, but there are over 120 cats.",
    "The story goes that the islanders raised silkworms...",
    "...to produce silk for their fishing nets,...",
    "...but mice eat silkworms,...",
    "...so cats were kept in order to keep the mice population down.",
    "People on the island will sometimes feed the feral felines,...",
    "...but mostly the cats fend for themselves by eating fresh fish.",
    "There's only one ferry to the island, so there can only be 34 visitors a day,...",
    "...but there are no hotels and no shops here,...",
    "...only elderly inhabitants and a ton of cats."
