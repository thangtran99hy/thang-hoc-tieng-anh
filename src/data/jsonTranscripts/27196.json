    "Sister Madonna Buder, 86 years old, goes for a morning run.",
    "Good for you, Sister.",
    "She's still active at her age, that's great.",
    "Whoa, maybe a little too active.",
    "Nap time, sister?",
    "I don't think so.",
    "The sister doesn't think so, okay.",
    "Wait, what? Ironman?",
    "Oh no, no, no, no, no, this is a bad idea, sister.",
    "A real bad idea!",
    "Relax! She's the Iron Nun!",
    "But she won't make it, this is an Ironman!",
    "The first 45 didn't kill me!",
    "You've done 45 of these?",
    "Okay! Do your thing, sister.",
    "Do your thing."
