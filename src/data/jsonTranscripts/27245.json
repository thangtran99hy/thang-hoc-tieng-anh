    "I like for you to be still.",
    "It is as though you are absent....",
    "...and you hear me from far away and my voice does not touch you.",
    "It seems as though your eyes had flown away...",
    "...and it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth.",
    "As all things are filled with my soul,...",
    "...you emerge from the things filled with my soul.",
    "You are like my soul, a butterfly of dream,...",
    "...and you are like the word \"melancholy\".",
    "I like for you to be still and you seem far away.",
    "It sounds as though you are lamenting, a butterfly cooing like a dove,...",
    "...and you hear me from far away and my voice does not reach you.",
    "Let me come to be still in your silence...",
    "...and let me talk to you with your silence that is bright as a lamp,...",
    "...simple as a ring."
