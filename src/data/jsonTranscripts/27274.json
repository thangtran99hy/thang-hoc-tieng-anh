    "Win.",
    "What's the matter, Usain?",
    "What if I don't win?",
    "What if you don't win?",

    "So many worries on your mind that you forgot...",
    "...which shoe goes on which foot.",
    "Maybe you forgot who you are, too.",
    "The boy I know has no worries...",
    "...because all worries ever do is weigh you down.",
    "Usain, you have to remember,...",
    "...you can always go faster when you keep it light, you see.",
    "Okay. No worries, mama."
