    "The Dubai city tour is an excellent way to get a lay of the land.",
    "It starts at The Palm, where you see all the access at the Atlantis,...",
    "...and then it goes across the city.",
    "And now we're in the old city,...",
    "...where you're hearing all the call to prayer is going on.",
    "It's just like being back in time.",
    "The second stop on our Dubai city tour is the Burj Al Arab.",
    "It's a seven-star resort and it's pretty spectacular to see.",
    "Who would have thought that there is such an old feel here...",
    "...in the modern city of Dubai?",
    "One final thing that you have to do is go up the Burj Khalifa.",
    "It's the tallest structure in the world...",
    "...and the view from there is spectacular."
