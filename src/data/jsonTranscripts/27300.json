    "Like a small boat on the ocean...",
    "...sending big waves into motion,...",
    "...like how a single word can make a heart open,...",
    "...I might only have one match but I can make an explosion.",
    "And all those things I didn't say,...",
    "...wrecking balls inside my brain.",
    "I will scream them loud tonight.",
    "Can you hear my voice this time?",
    "This is our fight song,...",
    "...take back our life song,...",
    "...prove we're alright song.",
    "My power's turned on.",
    "Starting right now, I'll be strong.",
    "I'll play my fight song...",
    "...and I don't really care if nobody else believes.",
    "'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me."
