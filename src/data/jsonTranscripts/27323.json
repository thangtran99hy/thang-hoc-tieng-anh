    "Sunday morning, rain is falling.",
    "Steal some covers, share some skin.",
    "Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable,...",
    "...you twist to fit the mold that I am in.",
    "But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do.",
    "I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew...",
    "...that someday it would lead me back to you,...",
    "...that someday it would lead me back to you.",
    "That may be all I need,...",
    "...in darkness she is all I see.",
    "Come and rest your bones with me.",
    "Driving slow on Sunday morning, oh I never wanna leave."
