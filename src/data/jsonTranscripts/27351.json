    "Ever since I can remember, I've always looked up to you.",
    "When we were little girls, I thought you were so cool.",
    "I did everything I could to dress and act exactly like you...",
    "...because I wanted to be like you.",
    "Now that I have my own taste in clothes, obviously better taste,...",
    "...I want you to know I still consider you an incredible role model.",
    "You've shown me what being a sister means.",
    "Being a sister means bringing chicken noodle soup when she feels sick.",
    "It means fighting over who gets to ride shotgun and sometimes letting her win.",
    "Being a sister means picking her up from a party...",
    "...when she's had too much to drink.",
    "Being a sister means a lot of different things.",
    "But most importantly, it means you'll always have a best friend.",
    "Thank you for helping me grow from a girl into a woman.",
    "I love you."
