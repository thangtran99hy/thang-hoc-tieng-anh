    "These days we can get things done, get around,...",
    "...spend our whole day without really moving.",
    "Thing is, our bodies were made to move...",
    "...so, we just need to sit less and move more throughout the day.",
    "Squeeze in a minute here, a minute there,...",
    "...anything to get your heart pumping.",
    "As long as you're moving, you don't have to hit the gym.",
    "Just find something you love to do,...",
    "...like this or that,...",
    "...and chances are, you'll keep doing it.",
    "The less we sit now, the more active we can be later in life."
