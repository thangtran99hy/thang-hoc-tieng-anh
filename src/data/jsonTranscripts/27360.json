    "ï»¿Once upon a time, that's what we old folks say when we're not sure of the date,...",
    "...but way back when, there was an old man who built puppets.",
    "The kind with strings attached to their arms, and legs, and heads.",
    "It's called \"marionettes\" actually.",
    "This man was a very lonely old man.",
    "And so, he would build these puppets to keep him company.",
    "Pretty smart, actually.",
    "Well one day, this old man built a puppet so amazing...",
    "...that it actually started to move on its own!",
    "Well, hi!",
    "Are you my papa?",
    "I sure am!",
    "And you are Pinocchio.",
    "Beautiful!",
    "What a lovely way to end a story."
