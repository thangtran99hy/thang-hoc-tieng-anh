    "Why should over 200 years of Citi history matter to you?",
    "Well, because it tells us something powerful about progress:...",
    "...that whether times are good or bad,...",
    "...people and their ideas will continue to move the world forward...",
    "...as long as they have someone to believe in them.",
    "Citi financed the Transatlantic Cable that connected continents,...",
    "...and the Panama Canal that made our world a smaller place.",
    "We backed the Marshall Plan that helped Europe regain its strength,...",
    "...and pioneered the ATM for cash anytime.",
    "For over two centuries, we've supported dreams like these,...",
    "...and the people and companies behind them.",
    "So, why should that matter to you?",
    "Because today, we are still helping progress makers turn their ideas into reality.",
    "And the next great idea could be yours."
