    "Number one: Just ask and ask nicely.",

    "...so simply say to the salesperson or store manager that you're on a tight budget...",
    "...and you want to know if they could do a better deal on the price.",
    "Odds are they'll knock a few dollars off the price.",
    "Number two: Go for the volume discount.",
    "If you're thinking about buying more than one of something,...",
    "...see if the store can give you a discount for buying multiple items.",
    "Finally, offer to pay cash.",
    "Ask if the store could give you a better deal if you pay cash.",
