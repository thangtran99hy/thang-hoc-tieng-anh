    "So Jamal, what made you choose this bank to open an account?",
    "Well, I've heard a lot of good things about this bank.",
    "And I don't live too far from here,...",
    "...so it's pretty convenient for me.",
    "Good, good. Okay, let's get you started.",
    "So what type of account would you like to open?",
    "A savings or a checking account?",
    "I don't know.",
    "Doesn't matter to me.",
    "Well, I was thinking of opening a checking account.",
    "But I'm not sure what the difference is between that or savings account.",
    "Well Jamal, a checking account is an account used to deposit money at a bank.",
    "Money can be added or removed from the account by visiting the bank or writing a check.",
    "If the account earns interest, it's usually at a lower rate than a savings account.",
    "A savings account is an account you have...",
    "...for the purpose of saving money over a period of time.",
    "Only you can take out money you put into your savings account."
