    "I've seen the whole of Banff National Park, which is just a marvelous place.",
    "And I've seen so much wildlife.",
    "It's so accessible here.",
    "It's everywhere.",
    "It's a huge nest.",
    "Every wildlife encounter I have has an emotional effect on me...",
    "...because it changes your knowledge of something.",
    "There's a rush that comes from seeing wildlife.",
    "It's so exciting.",
    "And once you've felt it, you want to keep doing it."
