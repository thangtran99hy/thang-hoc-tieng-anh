    "I am a witch's cat and Shadow is my name.",
    "Don't ever try to stroke me for I was never tame.",
    "My fur is black as jet.",
    "My eyes are piercing white.",
    "If I cross your path, I may give you a fright.",
    "I am a working cat; there is no time to play.",
    "I must make sure all spells are cast in the right way.",
    "The witch relies upon me much more I need not say.",
    "So if you spot me passing just quickly walk away."
