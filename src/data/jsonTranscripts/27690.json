    "No problem!",
    "What can I get you for lunch?",
    "Would I be bad if I ordered pad thai?",

    "Sorry to interrupt, do you want to order something for lunch?",
    "Oh yeah, can I get a spinach wrap with tomato, avocado, corn and onions,...",
    "...and then could you throw it in the garbage because I would never eat that?",
    "Thank you so much.",
    "Sure thing.",
    "Sorry about that.",
    "Five, six, and then seven, eight.",
