    "She's got a smile that it seems to me...",
    "...reminds me of childhood memories,...",
    "...where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky.",
    "Now and then when I see her face,...",
    "...she takes me away to that special place.",
    "And if I stared too long,...",
    "...I'd probably break down and cry.",
    "Oh, sweet child of mine.",
    "Oh, oh, oh, oh, sweet love of mine."
