    "Seismic activity is concentrated along fault lines:...",

    "...forcing one beneath the other.",
    "The resulting friction creates energy along the fault lines,...",
    "...which eventually become unstable and rupture, sending out a shock wave.",
    "The energy released is felt as an earthquake.",

    "...aftershocks can strike as neighboring plates readjust into place.",

    "It was devised to measure large tremors more accurately than the older Richter scale.",

    "...in other words, possible consequences.",
    "There are 12 levels.",

    "...which could be triggered such as landslides, avalanches, or tsunamis."
