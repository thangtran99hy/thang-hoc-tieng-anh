    "Looks like we're in some sort of futuristic landing pad to take off on this plane.",
    "I'm gonna put on my headphones, I'm gonna turn around and turn on the game.",
    "So, I have these controllers, whoops.",
    "So, these are my controllers.",
    "They're like little shooters.",
    "We're gonna turn around.",
    "Ready to rock.",
    "There we go.",
    "Okay, I'm kind of in outer space now.",
    "I'm trying to shoot aliens.",

    "Hey guys, the shield is awesome.",
    "Now I have two shields.",
    "That's amazing."
