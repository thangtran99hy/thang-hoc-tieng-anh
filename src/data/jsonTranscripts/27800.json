    "Party girls don't get hurt, can't feel anything.",
    "When will I learn?",
    "I push it down, push it down.",
    "I'm the one for a good-time call, phone's blowing up,...",
    "...ringing my doorbell.",
    "I feel the love, feel the love.",
    "One, two, three, drink. One, two, three, drink.",
    "Throw 'em back 'til I can't count.",
    "I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier.",
    "I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist.",
    "I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night,...",
    "...feel my tears as they dry.",
    "I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier.",
    "I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes.",
    "Keep my glass full until morning light...",
    "...'cause I'm just holding on for tonight, on for tonight."
