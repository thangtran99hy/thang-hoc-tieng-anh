    "As visions of sugarplums danced in our heads,...",
    "...out on the roof those reindeer hooves tenderly tread.",
    "I can hear his sleigh jingling on its way.",
    "He has presents for you.",
    "He filled up his sack,...",
    "...threw it on his back.",
    "He has presents for you.",
    "He came in like a Santa Claus,...",
    "...down the chimney like he always does.",
    "Only crumbs left where the cookie was,...",
    "...all he ever did was give gifts to me.",
    "He gives gifts to me."
