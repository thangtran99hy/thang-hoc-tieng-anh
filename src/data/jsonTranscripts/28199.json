    "I truly believe that the privilege of a lifetime is being who you are...",
    "...and I just recently embraced that at 51.",
    "I think my strongest power is that at 10 o'clock every Thursday night,...",
    "...I want you to come into my world, I am not gonna come into yours.",
    "You come into my world and you sit with me, my size, my hue, my age,...",
    "...and you, you sit and you experience.",
    "And I think that's the only power I have as an artist, so I thank you for this award.",
    "And I do see her, just like I see me."
