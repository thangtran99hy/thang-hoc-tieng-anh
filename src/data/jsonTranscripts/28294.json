    "Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, girl of the South Side,...",
    "...for the past 25 years, you have not only been my wife and mother of my children,...",
    "...you have been my best friend.",
    "You took on a role you didn't ask for and you made it your own...",
    "...with grace and with grit and with style and good humor.",
    "You made the White House a place that belongs to everybody,...",
    "...and a new generation sets its sights higher because it has you as a role model.",
    "So, you have made me proud and you have made the country proud."
