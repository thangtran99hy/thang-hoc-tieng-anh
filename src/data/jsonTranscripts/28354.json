    "I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed.",
    "I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head.",
    "And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye.",
    "And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night.",
    "When you looked over your shoulder, for a minute I forget that I'm older.",
    "I wanna dance with you right now.",
    "And you look as beautiful as ever.",
    "And I swear that every day you'll get better.",
    "You make me feel this way somehow.",
    "I'm so in love with you and I hope you know.",
    "Darling, your love is more worth its weight in gold.",
    "We've come so far my dear, look how we've grown.",
    "And I wanna stay with you until we're gray and old.",
    "Just say you won't let go."
