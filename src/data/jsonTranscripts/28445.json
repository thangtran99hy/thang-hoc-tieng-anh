    "ï»¿What do I tell my daughter?",
    "Do I tell her that her grandpa's worth is more than her grandma,...",
    "...that her dad is worth more than her mom?",
    "Do I tell her that despite her education, her drive, her skills, her intelligence,...",
    "...she will automatically be valued as less than every man she ever meets?",
    "Or maybe, I'll be able to tell her something different."
