    "I've walked a thousand coastlines along the shores of a dozen seas,...",
    "...blistered my feet on a sunbaked sand of a thousand beaches.",
    "Flesh seared, thirst unquenched, I searched and searched.",
    "Finally, I found this paradise.",
    "And you friend, what journey brought you here?",
    "I just booked on Expedia.ca.",
    "So many beach vacation providers are right there, so it's really easy.",
    "See?",
    "How long did that take?",
    "About two seconds.",
    "Don't spend your whole life searching.",
    "Great deals on your perfect beach vacation await on Expedia.ca.",
    "Your trip, your way."
