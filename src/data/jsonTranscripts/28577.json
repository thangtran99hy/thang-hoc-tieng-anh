    "Chris and I were looking at Chris's book about tigers.",
    "It was so cool.",
    "It had pictures of orange tigers and white tigers.",
    "Then out of nowhere, we went over a bump.",
    "We dropped the book and it landed far away.",
    "\"Don't worry, I'll get it,\" I said.",
    "\"Wait!\" Chris said.",
    "\"You should stay seated until the bus driver says that it is okay to stand,\"...",
    "...he told me.",
    "\"But I'm going to get your book,\" I said.",
    "Then, we went over another bump.",
    "And I fell back into my seat.",
    "\"Are you okay?\" Chris asked.",
    "\"Yes,\" I said.",
    "But you're right.",
    "It's safer to stay seated when I'm on the bus.",
    "We can get the book when we get there.",
    "And when the bus driver says it's okay to stand."
