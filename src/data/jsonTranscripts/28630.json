    "Once long ago, in the deep blue below...",
    "There's no such thing as mermaids.",
    "You wouldn't say that if you had met one.",
    "There is some magic that is real and some that is illusion.",
    "Wow!",
    "Let me introduce you to your dreams:...",
    "...the little mermaid of the Mississippi!",
    "You're the mermaid.",
    "I am.",
    "How do you have legs?",
    "It's a secret.",
    "Where I come from, we have a fairy tale...",
    "...about a little girl born on land, blessed with the heart of a mermaid.",
    "He said I had the heart of a mermaid.",
    "You do."
