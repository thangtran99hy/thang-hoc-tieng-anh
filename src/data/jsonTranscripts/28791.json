    "Approximately 750,000 years ago,...",
    "...three volcanoes converged to form Easter Island,...",
    "...located about 3,500 miles off the Chilean coast.",
    "Easter Island was named after the date it was discovered in 1722...",
    "...by the Dutch explorer, Jacob Roggeveen, who was in search of Terra Australis.",
    "Perhaps the most iconic feature of Easter Island is the Moai statues.",
    "They stand as tall as 30 feet and are head-to-thigh carvings of venerated ancestors.",
    "It is still uncertain exactly how they were moved in such great distances."
