    "I'm just gonna dive right in guys.",
    "Okay.",

    "Serious edge, guys.",
    "Yeah.",
    "So, something with a different feel.",

    "Awesome.",
    "Quirky characters.",
    "Right.",
    "Okay, so you're looking for something really unique.",
    "No, no.",

    "Right.",
    "You mean something big?",
    "No Ted, bigger than big.",
    "I'm thinking of something epic!",
    "But what about making something tiny?",
    "Really tiny?",

    "...and precious.",
    "That sounds totally doable.",
    "I think it needs to be a lot more edgy, more abstract.",
    "Maybe just like in black and white.",
    "Exactly!",
    "But with a bit of color.",
    "Actually scratch that.",
    "Ideally, we really want it to look sweet, I mean, cute but not really.",
    "I totally visualize it now.",
    "Nothing weird though, Ted, okay?"
