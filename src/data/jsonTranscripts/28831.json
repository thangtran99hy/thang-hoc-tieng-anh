    "Maybe I should go to the grocery store like a normal person..",

    "I choose to ride the escalator going down...",
    "...and to stream movies I own on DVD.",
    "And to let social media remember birthdays for me.",
    "I choose to wear the internet on my face.",
    "It's open.",
    "Hey, your car is here.",
    "Nice.",

    "...like some sort of animal or do anything else the old way.",
    "Doug.",
    "And yes, I choose to buy a Carvana car from my couch...",
    "...and have it delivered to my front door with a seven-day test own.",
    "Because what you call lazy, I call brilliant."
