    "Between our first breath and our last, our lives are shaped by how we move,...",
    "...by how hard we push.",
    "Flip, fly and hang.",
    "Our stories are written on our calluses and scars...",
    "...through our battles and mistakes.",
    "But as our bodies change, so do we.",
    "We become braver, kinder, closer.",
    "We become more human."
