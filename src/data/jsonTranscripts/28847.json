    "It is an important question you ask, but one, I think, with a simple answer.",

    "And once we do, we see there is wonder waiting on the other side.",
    "Every step you take brings the world one step closer.",
    "You'll narrowly influence some narrow minds.",
    "You'll bridge continents, puncture prejudice and keep peace.",
    "You may not always know it at the time,...",
    "...but one day you will look back and see that you have made this world a better place.",
    "So, the question you asked me, \"What is the key?\"",
    "It's you."
