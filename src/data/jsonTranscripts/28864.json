    "One day, a man was walking along the beach...",
    "...when he noticed a boy picking up starfish and throwing them into the ocean.",
    "Approaching the boy he asked, \"Excuse me, but what are you doing?\"",
    "The boy replied, \"Throwing starfish back into the ocean.\"",
    "\"The sun is rising and the tide is going out.\"",
    "\"If I don't throw them back, they'll die.\"",
    "The man laughed to himself and said,...",
    "\"But there's too many starfish on this beach.\"",
    "\"You can't possibly make a difference.\"",
    "After listening politely, the boy bent down,...",
    "...picked up another starfish and threw it into the ocean.",
    "Then, turning to the man, he said, ...",
    "\"I made a difference to that one.\""
