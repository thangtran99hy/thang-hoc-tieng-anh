    "Today, let's learn how to pray at a shrine.",
    "First, let's ring the bell to greet the god.",
    "Second, throw a coin into the offering box.",
    "We usually use a five yen coin...",
    "...because in Japan, five yen is considered good fortune.",
    "Okay, now that you got god's attention, bow twice to show your respect...",
    "...and then clap your hands twice to express your joy of meeting with the god.",
    "Put your palms together and make the prayer.",
    "Finally, bow once again and you are now a proper prayer.",
    "Well done!"
