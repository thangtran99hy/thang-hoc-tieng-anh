    "As I looked through the photos, there were some that were over a hundred years old,...",
    "...some still in the envelope from the processing lab.",
    "I couldn't help but think as a retoucher...",
    "...that I could fix that tear and mend that scratch,...",
    "...and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.",
    "So that evening, I just reached out on Facebook and asked a few of them,...",
    "...and by morning, the response had been so overwhelming and so positive,...",
    "...I knew we had to give it a go.",
    "So we started retouching photos.",
    "Over time, more photos came in, thankfully,...",
    "...and more retouchers were needed,...",
    "...and so I reached out again on Facebook and LinkedIn,...",
    "...and within five days, 80 people wanted to help from 12 different countries.",
    "Within two weeks, I had 150 people wanting to join in.",
    "Once a week, we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries...",
    "...that had been set up, where people were reclaiming their photos.",
    "The older ladies sometimes hadn't seen a scanner before,...",
    "...but within ten minutes of them finding their lost photo,...",
    "...they could give it to us, have it scanned, upload it to a cloud server.",
    "It would be downloaded by a gaijin, a stranger, somewhere on the other side of the globe,...",
    "...and it'd start being fixed.",
    "The time it took, however, to get it back is a completely different story,...",
    "...and it depended obviously on the damage involved.",
    "It could take an hour.",
    "It could take weeks.",
    "It could take months."
