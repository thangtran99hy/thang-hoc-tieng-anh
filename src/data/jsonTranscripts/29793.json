    "Life is busy enough without all the added push notifications.",
    "Oh, come on Instagram, I'm late for work.",
    "Almost every app is grasping to pull us out of the real world and into the digital one.",
    "Breaking news, Facebook, breaking news.",
    "They bug us everywhere.",
    "And I mean everywhere.",
    "And they bug us about everything...",
    "Oh, come on!",
    "...and anything.",
    "Seriously, anything.",
    "Oh, this is important.",
    "And that right there is the biggest problem with push notifications.",
    "It's very hard to find the important ones in a sea of unimportant ones."
