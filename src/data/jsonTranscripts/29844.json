    "ï»¿I am here at the University of Sydney where the mechanical engineering shop...",
    "...has built this incredible piece of apparatus for me.",
    "It is a 40-pound, that is 19-kilogram, flywheel on the end of a meter-long shaft.",
    "Can you imagine trying to hold this out horizontally with just one hand at this end?",
    "It is virtually... It is impossible, okay?",
    "Let's prove that I could lift it, just this end, without it spinning.",
    "Here we go.",
    "I mean, it's just kind of awkward with the hand.",
    "Careful!",
    "Just barely.",
    "Oh goodness, do you even lift?",
    "Clearly I do not.",
    "Undaunted by my lack of strength, I'm going for it.",
    "But I want to make sure that the wheel is spinning as fast as possible...",
    "...to give me the best chance of success.",
    "Now, I am going to release my left hand...",
    "...and, holding only with my right hand at the end of the shaft,...",
    "...I'll try to lift it up over my head.",
    "This is a 40-pound, 19-kilogram flywheel.",
    "Ready?",
    "Here we go: three, two, one.",
    "Beautiful!"
