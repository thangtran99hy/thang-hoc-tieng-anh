    "Hi, my name is Katie Stagliano.",
    "I'm 14 years old.",
    "And in 2008, I started Katie's Krops as a way to fight hunger.",
    "I definitely also learned about the face of hunger and the face of homelessness.",
    "There could be families just like yours who are struggling with hunger,...",
    "...who are struggling to find a place to live.",
    "So I think it's really altered my perspective...",
    "...and showed me that you definitely may not know...",
    "...who's hungry and who's homeless...",
    "...and that's really changed the way I think of things.",
    "When I first started Katie's Krops,...",
    "...it was something that I started locally in my community...",
    "...so the saying \"Think globally and act locally,\"...",
    "...I think it really hits home for me...",
    "...because I started to end hunger in my community...",
    "...and it's really expanded and gone nationally.",
    "My goal is to have at least one vegetable garden...",
    "...in all 50 states across the United States...",
    "...and we are doing that by giving grants to other kids...",
    "...and we have over 60 gardens from Maine to Hawaii this year so it's really exciting,...",
    "...but I think that people should realize,...",
    "...it doesn't matter if you're 9 or 99 or if you're a celebrity...",
    "...or if you're someone just like me, you can start in your own community...",
    "...and you can truly make a difference."
