    "ï»¿Are we all born the same?",
    "Do we share the same dreams?",
    "What is expected of us?",
    "Will love always be carefree?",
    "Through whose eyes do we see ourselves?",
    "Do we have an expiry date?",
    "And if we haven't ticked all the right boxes,...",
    "...are we worth less after turning thirty?",
    "Or can things be different?",
    "Can we decide for ourselves...",
    "...who we are,...",
    "...who we aspire to be,...",
    "...what really matters...",
    "...and the messages we pass on to others?",
    "Can we change destiny by changing our thoughts?"
