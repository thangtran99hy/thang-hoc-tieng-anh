    "Each month, 15 people are injured on its escalators.",

    "Wait for it.",
    "Hello everybody and please listen up.",
    "I said to my colleague that my wife was bringing down the two kids...",

    "And he said, \"Would Megan mind doing a PA announcement...",
    "...regarding the safety on the escalators?\"",
    "She does like a bit of acting so I knew she'd be up for it.",
    "It took several takes to get the perfect recording.",
    "I was really nervous when I was first going to do it...",
    "...but then once I did it, I thought, \"This is actually okay.\"",
    "Research shows that deeper adult voices...",
    "...are perceived by humans as having more authority.",

    "..but perhaps it's the shock factor.",
    "Megan's announcements have been running at the station for 6 months.",
