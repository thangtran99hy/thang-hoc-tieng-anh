    "Barranco is one of Lima's trendy neighborhoods.",
    "In the 80s, it was more of a Bohemian artist community...",
    "...and now it's very popular for young people...",
    "...for nightlife, for cafes, and it generally has a very cool vibe.",
    "Its artistic roots show on the walls, inside the shops...",
    "...and just in the general laid-back attitude...",
    "...of these homey streets.",
    "This neighborhood is really trendy right now,...",
    "...but it still kind of feels like a walk back in time.",
    "There was something nostalgically old-fashioned...",
    "...about Barranco, which I think is what makes it so popular,...",
    "...and its name translates to \"cliff\"...",
    "...as the area is actually located right along the cliff's edge."
