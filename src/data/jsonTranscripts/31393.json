    "Every match I've been playing really good tennis,...",
    "...and, well, maybe I had more pressure a few years ago.",
    "You know, I wanted to keep in the top 10 every year,...",
    "...and that gave me a little bit of pressure.",
    "Right now I don't have any pressure,...",
    "...but I also enjoy playing every match...",
    "...and enjoy playing tennis again a little more than before."
