    "ï»¿GDP is an important gauge of the overall health of an economy.",
    "It stands for gross domestic product.",
    "Simply put, GDP measures the total value of all goods and services in a country.",
    "How do you get to these numbers?",
    "Well, you can calculate GDP in a few different ways,...",
    "...but the most commonly used equation goes like this:...",
    "...consumption plus investment plus government spending...",
    "...plus net exports equals GDP.",
    "Let's break that down.",
    "Consumption is another way of saying consumer spending.",
    "It's the money you or I spend on physical goods like coffee,...",
    "...and on services like a haircut.",
    "The second part of the GDP equation is investment.",
    "This measures how much businesses spend...",
    "...on things like buildings, land and equipment.",
    "Okay, now we get to government spending.",
    "This is the money local, state and national governments spend on things like roads, schools and defense.",
    "That brings us to the final part of the GDP calculation:...",
    "...net exports, or exports minus imports.",
    "A lot of countries have negative net exports, meaning they bring in more products than they send out."
