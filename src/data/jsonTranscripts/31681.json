    "Good morning, how are you?",
    "Hey! What's the matter?",
    "Oh I know! Your wing is torn and you can't fly anymore.",
    "Oh! Good to see you, Bear.",
    "The Bee can't fly anymore, do you know how to help?",
    "Oh hello, Bird! Do you know how to help the Bee?",
    "Oh hello, Fox! Do you know how to help the Bee?",
    "What?! You want to eat the Bee for dinner?!",
    "No way, that's a really bad idea.",
    "Oh no, does nobody know what to do?",
    "Aha Spider, we need your help here!",
    "Yay! Your wing is fixed!",
    "The Spider sewed it up with her thread.",
    "Now you can fly happily again."
