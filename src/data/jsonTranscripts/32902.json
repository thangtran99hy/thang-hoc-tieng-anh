    "Recently, I flew over a crowd of thousands of people in Brazil playing music by George Frideric Handel.",
    "I also drove along the streets of Amsterdam, again, playing music by this same composer.",
    "Let's take a look.",
    "I live there on the third floor.",
    "All this was a real magical experience for hundreds of reasons.",
    "Now, you may ask, why have I done these things?",
    "They're not really typical for a musician's day-to-day life.",
    "Well, I did it because I fell in love with the music...",
    "...and I wanted to share it with as many people as possible.",
    "It started a couple of years ago.",
    "I was sitting at home on the couch with the flu and browsing the Internet a little...",
    "...when I found out that Handel had written works for the keyboard.",
    "Well, I was surprised.",
    "I did not know this.",
    "So, I downloaded the sheet music and started playing...",
    "...and what happened next was that I entered this state of pure, unprejudiced amazement.",
    "It was an experience of being totally in awe of the music,...",
    "...and I had not felt that in a long time.",
    "It might be easier to relate to this when you hear it.",
    "The first piece that I played through started like this."
