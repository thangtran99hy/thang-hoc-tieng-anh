    "You probably think of things like this: finely crafted objects that you can hold in your hand,...",
    "...or maybe logos and posters and maps that visually explain things,...",
    "...classic icons of timeless design,...",

    "I want to talk about the kind that you probably use every day and may not give much thought to,...",
    "...designs that change all the time and that live inside your pocket.",
    "I'm talking about the design of digital experiences and specifically the design of systems...",
    "...that are so big that their scale can be hard to comprehend.",
    "Consider the fact that Google processes over one billion search queries every day,...",
    "...that every minute, over 100 hours of footage are uploaded to YouTube.",

    "...and Facebook transmitting the photos, messages and stories of over 1.23 billion people,...",
    "...that's almost half of the Internet population and a sixth of humanity.",
    "These are some of the products that I've helped design over the course of my career,...",
    "...and their scale is so massive that they've produced unprecedented design challenges,...",
    "...but what is really hard about designing at scale is this:...",
    "...It's hard in part because it requires a combination of two things: audacity and humility;...",
    "...audacity to believe that the thing that you're making...",

    "...decided that it needed to be redesigned.",
    "The button had kind of gotten out of sync with the evolution of our brand...",

    "Now, you might think, well, it's a tiny little button,...",
    "...it probably is a pretty straightforward, easy design assignment, but it wasn't.",
