    "Hi friends!",
    "How are you?",
    "I'm visiting a new city and I do not know where the places are.",
    "So let's learn how to ask for directions and give addresses in English.",
    "I'm going to ask for this kind man.",
    "Hello, excuse me, could you tell me where is the main square?",
    "To ask for directions, we can also use, \"How do I get to the main square?\"",
    "...or, \"What's the best way to the main square?\"",
    "Remember to be polite and say:...",
    "\"Excuse me, could you tell me or can you tell me.\"",
    "Go straight on until you come to the square.",
    "And you know what's the best way to the station?",
    "The bus station is on the right and the train station is on the left.",
    "Great, thanks!"
