    "The most interesting things that we should know about the solar system are the planets.",
    "Let's look at them, starting with the ones closest to the sun...",
    "...and then getting further away!",
    "The closest planet to the sun is Mercury; then there is Venus; then comes the Earth.",
    "Yes, our planet where we live.",
    "Then there is Mars, Jupiter, the largest planet, Saturn, Uranus...",
    "...and then the farthest away is Neptune.",
    "As you can see, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are closer to the sun...",
    "...and also smaller than Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune."
