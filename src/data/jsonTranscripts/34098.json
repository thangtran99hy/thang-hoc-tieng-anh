    "Here's the problem.",
    "When you have any two samples of water...",
    "...that's just ordinary tap water,...",
    "...one of them will always freeze first.",
    "That's because the mixture of impurities in the water...",
    "...will be slightly different.",
    "The differences in composition, size,...",
    "....and position of those impurities can make...",
    "...the freezing point of water vary by several degrees.",
    "Hot tap water will freeze before cold distilled water...",
    "...if you control for all other conditions...",
    "...because impurities in the tap water mean...",
    "...that it just freezes at a higher temperature.",
    "So in that case, the hot water does freeze first,...",
    "...but not because it's hot.",
    "If the Mpemba Effect is a thing,...",
    "...and warmer water really does freeze faster,...",
    "...there are a lot of theories for why that might happen.",
    "Evaporation is the simplest and probably the best one.",
    "Some of the hot water will evaporate as it cools,...",
    "...meaning there's just less water to freeze,...",
    "...so it doesn't take as much time.",
    "But the Mpemba Effect has been observed...",
    "...while using sealed containers.",
    "Which prevented evaporated water from escaping.",
    "Other researchers who have looked into the Mpemba Effect...",
    "...claimed it has to do with convection currents,...",
    "...the way the water moves around as it heats.",
    "Or covalent bonds.",
    "Or how hot water holds less dissolved gas,...",
    "...which maybe does... something.",
    "They're not really sure.",
    "Want to test it yourself?",
    "Stick some water in your freezer...",
    "...and see if you notice something weird.",
    "Who knows, maybe youâ€™ll get an effect named after you."
