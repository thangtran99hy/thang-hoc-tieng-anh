    "The lungs bring oxygen into the body when you breathe.",
    "From there, it has to find its way to every other part of your body,...",
    "...and the blood is its delivery service.",
    "The heart pumps blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen...",
    "...then pumps the oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body.",
    "After the blood has delivered all the oxygen,...",
    "...it picks up carbon dioxide, a waste product.",
    "Then the blood goes back to the lungs to drop off the carbon dioxide...",
    "...and pick up more oxygen.",
    "And the whole process begins again."
