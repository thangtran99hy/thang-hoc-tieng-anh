    "Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew...",
    "...that no people on earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans.",
    "If there is a mountain, we climb it.",
    "If there is a frontier, we cross it.",
    "If there's a challenge, we tame it.",
    "If there is an opportunity, we seize it.",
    "Americans love their country...",
    "...and they deserve a government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return.",
    "We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny...",
    "...and the same great American flag."
