    "I swam down deep into the beautiful blue ocean.",
    "I saw all kinds of colorful fish.",
    "Wow, look at that one!",
    "And that one right there!",
    "All the fish were different sizes and different colors.",
    "I kept swimming around to see what other sea animals I could find.",
    "I saw a dolphin, manta ray, seahorse, puffer fish, crab,...",
    "...octopus, sea turtle, jellyfish, and even a giant whale!",
    "I saw so many amazing sea creatures!"
