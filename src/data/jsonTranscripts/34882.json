    "There are pros and cons to the declaration of a pandemic...",
    "...but that brings us to the next question \"What do you do when organizations start declaring a pandemic?\"",
    "First off, you need to listen to healthcare professionals.",
    "They are on the frontline of these situations...",
    "...and are prepared to work with epidemiologists, researchers and scientists...",
    "...to effectively curb the disease.",
    "Be wary of unverified exaggerations and disinformation online.",
    "Again, if one is declared, nothing will legally change.",
    "But naturally, people will act accordingly.",
    "Hospitals around the world will become the frontline of defense,...",
    "...putting the sickest first and postponing unnecessary surgeries and appointments.",
    "Hospitals will also be extremely busy so households, businesses and communities...",
    "...will also need to work independently to decrease spread.",
    "Social isolation will become normal and mass gatherings will be cancelled.",
    "We'll all have to get used to washing our hands effectively and all the time...",
    "...and learn to not touch our face."
