    "The biggest reason why Freedom and Responsibility drives the success of Netflix...",
    "...is it encourages us all to be big risk takers.",
    "So, what does Freedom and Responsibility mean to me?",
    "It means three things.",
    "One, there's trust.",
    "I'm being trusted to make the right decisions in the best interest of Netflix.",
    "Number two is self-discipline.",
    "I have the self-discipline to exercise good due diligence and good judgement.",
    "And the third thing is accountability.",
    "I'm accountable for the outcomes of my decisions."
