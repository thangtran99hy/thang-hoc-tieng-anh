    "There's over a hundred different efforts...",
    "...making many different types of coronavirus vaccines.",
    "So how do you make a vaccine?",
    "Usually, you're injecting at least part of the shape of the virus.",
    "Sometimes you do the whole virus,...",
    "...but it's attenuated, so it doesn't multiply too much.",
    "Sometimes you take the virus and you kill it.",
    "You won't get sick because they're not duplicating.",
    "What's typically done is you just take either a piece of the virus...",
    "...or just the spike, that thing on the surface...",
    "...and you put it on something else,...",
    "...so there's no risk at all of causing the disease.",
    "One final way that's new and is promising is called the RNA vaccine.",
    "With RNA and DNA, instead of putting that shape in,...",
    "...you put instructions in the code to make that shape.",
    "So the Gates Foundation, along with a great number of partners,...",
    "...are looking at these different efforts.",
    "We've never created a new vaccine in less than five years.",
    "So, this is urgent and it's going to require incredible collaboration.",
    "So I am optimistic that one of the vaccine efforts...",
    "...will give us vaccines in the next 18 months,...",
    "...and we'll make sure that's produced in volume...",
    "...and that it's accessible to everyone in the world.",
    "That's how we're going to end this pandemic."
