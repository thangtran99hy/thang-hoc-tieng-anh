    "Honeybees have proven to be surprisingly intelligent...",
    "...compared to other critters in the insect kingdom.",
    "They have their own dance communication system and can understand the concept of zero.",

    "New research published in the journal Science Advances...",
    "...reveals that honeybees are capable of understanding simple math problems.",

    "...the basic rules of arithmetic.",
    "They trained them to enter a y-shaped maze...",
    "...where they first faced a series of color geometric shapes.",
    "The number and the color of the shapes would vary.",

    "...can figure out basic math in 100 tries."
