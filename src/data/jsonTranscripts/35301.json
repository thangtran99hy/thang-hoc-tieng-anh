    "Tell me if you can relate to this.",
    "You were an avid reader of fiction as a kid.",
    "The Harry Potter series, The Hunger Games, Bobby Pendragon, Percy Jackson.",
    "You ate them like ice cream; you drank them like water in summertime...",
    "...after running around at the park.",
    "You would spend hours in your bedroom, in another world, in another universe.",
    "I was one of those kids.",
    "That was my experience growing up.",
    "But somewhere along the line, like early teenage years, that all ended.",
    "I'm not sure it's a coincidence...",
    "...that I got my first smartphone when I was 14 years old.",
    "Suddenly, there were a lot of other things capturing my attention,...",
    "...you know, better things to do.",
    "I feel like many of us who are now in our 20s and 30s went through this.",
    "I mean, I went years without reading anything...",
    "...outside of what I was required to read at school.",
    "Last year, though, I rediscovered books,...",
    "...and now they are my very favorite way to absorb new information.",
    "I honestly think that every single book I have ever read...",
    "...has changed me and my perspective of the world in some way."
