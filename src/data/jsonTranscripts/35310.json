    "But the truth is that, after a while,...",
    "...it just became a series of reminders and you know, I got it.",
    "I no longer needed these reminders.",

    "He's even said on social media that he's perfectly okay with you unfollowing him...",
    "...to go and pursue meaning in life.",
    "I really do believe there's a lot of quality out there.",
    "You just have to kind of dig a little bit and get through the BS to get there."
