    "Don't be nervous.",
    "It's going to be fun.",
    "It works!",
    "They're off trying the car right now,...",
    "...and I thought we weren't gonna like this one but I actually really, really like it.",
    "It's our first one, so I'm glad we have a few more...",
    "...so we aren't just gonna buy one just because it's so exciting.",
    "But it actually seems good; the engine works fine,...",
    "...there's no foam in the oil, or rust in the oil.",
    "There's a bit of rust on the bottom, but not so much.",
    "It seems like it's a really dry car.",
    "It's been pouring the last few days,...",
    "...and there would be puddles if there was like some leaks and stuff, in the sides.",

    "I don't know.",

    "It needs a little bit of work on the right axle.",
    "There's some rust that we'd have to fix.",
    "It would need a new paint job.",
    "We'd have to tear everything out, but that's like the whole, what we want to do...",
    "...and build it ourselves.",
    "Okay, I think I hear them coming back.",
    "I'm really excited.",
    "Yeah, here they come."
