    "Today is the first day of our van build and to be honest, I'm a little nervous.",
    "I've never used power tools before,...",
    "...and on top of that, somehow, our van is stuck on the side of a mountain.",
    "Good thing my wrist isn't broken anymore.",
    "Yeah.",
    "This is definitely not the situation we had in mind for our demolition...",
    "...or our first day on the van build,...",
    "...but you know, sometimes you just gotta roll with what life gives you.",
    "In this moment, I felt like I was watching our van-life dream slowly slide down the mountain.",
    "Our van build was off to a tough start, but we were determined to get Ody out.",
    "We tried gravel, we tried deflating the tires,...",
    "...we enlisted the local handyman, Fabi, we bought snow chains and a winch,...",
    "...but every failed attempt brought us closer to the ravine below."
