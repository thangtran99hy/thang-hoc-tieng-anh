    "We are racing for a hundred-dollar bill.",

    "If those statements don't apply to you,...",
    "...I want you to stay right where you're at.",
    "Take two steps forward if both of your parents are still married.",
    "Take two steps forward if you grew up with a father figure in the home.",
    "Take two steps forward if you had access to a private education.",
    "Take two steps forward...",
    "...if you never had to help mom or dad with the bills.",
    "Take two steps forward if you never wondered...",

    "...I think it'd be extremely foolish of you...",
    "...not to utilize that and learn  more about somebody else's story.",
    "Because the reality is, if this was a fair race,...",
    "...and everybody's back on that line,...",
    "...I guarantee you, some of these black dudes will smoke all of you.",
    "And it's only because you have this big of a head start,...",
    "...that you're possibly gonna win this race called life.",
    "That is a picture of life, ladies and gentlemen."
