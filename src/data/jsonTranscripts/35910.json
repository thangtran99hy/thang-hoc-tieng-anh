    "So what's the difference between formal and informal writing styles?",
    "Well,...",
    "I tend to be complex and thorough.",
    "I'm simple and more conversational.",
    "I take on more serious topics in a very direct way.",
    "Well, I use a larger range of emotions and show more personality.",
    "Wait, I can see how this is going to end.",
    "Let's explain this one at a time.",
    "Formal writing, you're first.",
    "Step up to the microphone.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Like I said before I'm complex and thorough.",
    "I use longer sentences...",
    "...and each of my main points are introduced, elaborated on, and concluded.",
    "My articles use full words, not contractions or abbreviations.",
    "My writing is objective.",
    "I state the main points confidently and offer a full support of arguments.",
    "I am not a personal writing style.",
    "So, there are very few emotions included.",
    "Thank you for your time."
