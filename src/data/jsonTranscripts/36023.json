    "...all the items you've bought with the intention of selling to your customers,...",
    "...either as is or combined with other products.",
    "Then there are products that your business might install.",
    "Plumbers, for example, might sell gaskets and new faucets as part of a repair job.",
    "And then there are goods your business makes or manufactures.",

    "Equipment and supplies you've bought to run your business,...",
    "...such as work tools or vehicles, and stationery; those are not inventory.",
    "These are usually accounted for as assets or expenses.",

    "It's usually not considered inventory if you sell goods online...",
