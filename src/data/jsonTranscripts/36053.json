    "Entering water is like entering another world,....",
    "...moving freely in three dimensions.",
    "I am here and now.",
    "I am free.",
    "The first time I felt this, I fell in love.",
    "Freediving has become my life.",
    "The mind is like water.",
    "When it is turbulent, it is difficult to see,...",
    "...and when it's calm, everything becomes clear.",
    "Breathe in, breathe out.",
    "Inhale the future, exhale the past and embrace the very moment.",
    "It is quiet here under the surface.",
    "The calmness and peace I find here give me clarity of sight.",
    "I hear my inner voice."
