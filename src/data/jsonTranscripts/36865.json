    "The F-35 has been a dream to fly.",
    "It's wonderful.",
    "I've never flown an airplane like this...",
    "...where you can control the motion of the airplane so precisely.",
    "I'm not sure we've even scratched the surface yet of what this airplane,...",
    "...when it's operating with other F-35s, is going to be able to do."
