    "Hi, I'm Jade from Bogotastic,...",
    "...and today, we're gonna go explore some wonderful foods here in Bogota.",
    "All right, let's go!",
    "I am so hungry, you guys.",
    "I'm very excited to be here.",
    "Right here, I have the most delicious caldo de costilla,...",
    "...which is essentially beef broth with a little bit of cilantro and potato.",
    "It's my favorite, and I'm really excited to share it and eat it here with you today.",
    "So, Colombians love their cheesy breads and their arepas.",
    "Essentially, their arepas are like your bread at home,...",
    "...and there's all different types of arepas, and this is my absolute favorite.",
    "This is the best arepa you will try here in Colombia.",
    "The reason why it's choclo is because choclo is a type of corn.",
    "It's quite sweet.",
    "So, the arepa de choclo has, of course, cheese, panela and corn.",
    "This is soft and sweet.",
    "It's basically a soft, cheesy, sweet pancake.",
    "And next up, we have the beautiful envuelto,...",
    "...and as you will see, it is not corn but a special texture...",
    "...which is the same ingredients as those of the arepa.",
    "More corn, more sugar, more cheese.",
    "More deliciousness."
