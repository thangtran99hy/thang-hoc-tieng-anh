    "The amazing thing about souks around the Arab world...",
    "...is they're known as places that sell everything...",
    "...from spices, to textiles, to ornaments.",
    "Anything that you can think of, you will find it here.",
    "It wouldn't truly be a gold souk in Dubai if we weren't breaking world records:...",
    "...the world's largest gold ring.",
    "This is it.",
    "Sixty-three kilograms of gold and precious stones.",
    "Sixty-three kilograms; it's almost the same weight as me."
