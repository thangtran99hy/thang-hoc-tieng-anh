    "Trevor Hahn has been hiking in the Colorado mountains for years.",
    "And what's remarkable is that he's been legally blind since birth.",
    "But, he is hardly alone.",
    "His guide on those hikes these days, Melanie Knecht.",
    "Born with spina bifida, she uses a wheelchair.",
    "But, not on those mountains.",
    "Together, they help each other on the path.",
    "Melanie serves as Trevor's eyes and he lifts her on the journey.",
    "The two friends from Fort Collins met a year ago at an adaptive rock climbing class...",
    "...and quickly realized they could help one another.",
    "I just love to be on the top of the mountain...",
    "...because I can hear there's expansive space around me.",
    "I can listen to birds,...",
    "...I can listen to the waterfall like here right now in the background.",
    "We're gonna get really near up.",
    "He was telling me just about how he's been guided up mountains like using a voice system.",
    "And I'm like, \"Well, I have a voice.\"",
    "He now counts on that voice."
