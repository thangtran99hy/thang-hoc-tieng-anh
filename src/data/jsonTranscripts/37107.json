    "Hey bud, did you ever think that there's got to be more?",
    "More than what?",
    "The stuff we do, day after day.",
    "Literally, not once.",
    "Today's gonna be different, Goldie.",
    "What are we looking at?",
    "Who are you?",
    "We ran into each other the other day.",
    "How did you find me?",
    "I waited outside by the murder train.",
    "Guy, I have to tell you something.",
    "There is no easy way to say this.",
    "This world, it's a video game.",
    "Buddy, if we're not real, doesn't that mean that nothing you do matters?",
    "I am sitting here with my best friend trying to help him get through a tough time.",
    "Now if that's not real, I don't know what is.",
    "Milly, I know this world is just a game. But this place, these people, that's all I have.",
    "Thanks, Guy.",

    "You, this whole city, they'll be gone.",
    "What if we can save it?",
    "Is that cool?",
    "It felt really cool.",
    "We could change our world but we have to fight together.",
    "I don't know what's happening right now, but I love it.",
    "This is the first time I've ever driven a car before.",
    "I really wish you'd mention that.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Yeah.",
    "We love you, blue shirt guy!",
    "Thank you! Watch out for the...",
    "They seem nice."
