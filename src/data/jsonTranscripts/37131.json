    "Oh, hi Santa!",
    "Good morning! You know what, I can't even fake it.",

    "That works.",
    "This year has been harder than ever and yet,...",
    "...somehow, you all found a way to pull it off.",

    "It's about the little things.",
    "Santa? Santa, you're on mute.",
    "I wanted to say thanks.",
    "Thanks for believing."
