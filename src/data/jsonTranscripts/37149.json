    "Now, this shot here that you're seeing is pretty good.",
    "Fairly boring background and well-lit, the angle is good...",
    "...and the sound and the connection is spot on.",
    "That's what you want to aim for.",
    "We don't want something too distracting in the background.",
    "Otherwise, the person on the conference is going to start thinking, \"Well, I like that sofa.\"",
    "\"I think I got that cookery book.\" And they're not going to focus on what you are saying.",
    "So, keep it as neutral and as dull as possible.",
    "They should be focusing on your face.",
    "Nothing else.",
    "Now, we know what to do,...",
    "...let's have a look at some of the mistakes that people make...",
    "...when they video conference from home.",
    "And that's the sort of thing that we need to...",
    "Diana, are you still there?",
    "Diana?",
    "I can see you.",
    "Hello!",
    "The angle is critical.",
    "We don't want to see the top of your head.",
    "We need the lens of the camera pointing directly at your eyes.",
    "Lighting is key.",
    "Please test it in advance.",
    "Don't sit there in the shadow. Otherwise, you'll end up looking like...",
    "...an anonymous whistleblower on the news.",
    "Hello.",
    "Aww, I'll come and see you in a moment.",
    "Off you go.",
    "Good boy.",
    "You might love your pets but the person you're speaking to can't see them,...",
    "...can't enjoy stroking them and it's taking up a bit of their time.",
    "It's not good. Has your home got doors?",
    "I suggest you shut the door into the room where you are speaking to the person...",
    "...before you start.",
    "Yeah!",
    "Oh, I mean absolutely.",
    "Completely agree.",
    "What?",
    "Now, we should know what to do and what not to do when we video conference from home.",
    "I hope you stay safe and healthy."
