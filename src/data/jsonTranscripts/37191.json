    "Sir, I'm sorry you're unhappy with your purchase.",
    "And I'd like to work together to turn things around.",
    "Just like you, I would be really disappointed if this had happened to me.",
    "Is there something that I can do that would make this right?",
    "Can we come up with a solution?",
    "You know what, all I want is to have a drill that works.",
    "I just want to leave here today, go home and have a product that works.",
    "Okay.",
    "So, what if I were to go and get a drill from the back,...",
    "...we open up the package, allow for you to test it before you leave the store...",
    "...to make sure that it works.",
    "Would that be okay?",
    "If you can bring a drill out here...",
    "...and prove to me that it's gonna work when I leave, then fine.",
    "Yes.",
    "Okay.",
    "If you bear with me one moment, I'll be right back, sir.",
    "Okay.",
    "Here you go, sir.",
    "Here's one that you can open up and make sure that it works before you leave.",
    "Seems to be alright.",
    "Yeah, okay.",
    "This one seems to work.",
    "I want you to know that when I went back to grab this,...",
    "...I spoke to my manager.",
    "I want to thank you for taking the time and bringing this to our attention.",
    "Okay. Well, I appreciate that.",
    "And you know what, I know I came here a little hotheaded and frustrated...",
    "...but I appreciate the fact that you were able to get me a drill that works today.",
    "You're very welcome."
