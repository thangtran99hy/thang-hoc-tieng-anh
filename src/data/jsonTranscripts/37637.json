    "...and we are pretty sure that there are a lot of upgrades...",
    "...that you might want to do to your room or your house.",
    "Bring in some paint cans, put out some music or the stereo...",
    "...and have a great bonding time with your partner....",
    "...as you both work on your ideas together.",
    "We know that you all love to go out...",
    "...and catch a romantic comedy on the screens on this day...",
    "...but hey, pandemic alert.",
    "But how about making your own home theater?",
    "You can put out some popcorn, prop up some cushions...",
    "...and watch a great selection of romantic movies...",
    "...from any of the numerous streaming services available.",
    "Not a fan of movies?",
    "Have a cozy book night, snuggle under a blanket...",
    "...and try to finish a good book together with some cake on the side."
