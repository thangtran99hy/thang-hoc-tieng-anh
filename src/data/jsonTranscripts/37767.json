    "It's no secret.",
    "The middle has been a hard place to get to lately.",
    "Between red and blue.",
    "Between servant and citizen.",
    "Between our freedom and our fear.",

    "And we need that connection.",
    "We need the middle.",

    "We can make it to the mountaintop, through the desert,...",
    "...and we will cross this divide.",
    "Our light has always found its way through the darkness.",
    "And there's hope on the road up ahead."
