    "Hey, Anna, what are your favorite handbags for spring?",
    "To be honest, I rarely wear a handbag...",
    "...but I am told by my team here at Vogue...",
    "...that it's all about the crossbody handbag...",
    "...which makes a lot of sense to me because it's practical, hands-free.",
    "You can bicycle around Manhattan and enjoy in Central Park.",
    "And they also come in every shape, size, fabrication.",
    "So, that would be my tip for the season."
