    "There's never been a Japanese player here in Cincinnati.",
    "And so, in addition to the challenge of playing in the Majors,...",
    "...the challenge of being the first here,...",
    "...not having any kind of background or prior players been here,...",
    "...was also sort of an additional challenge which I was inspired to take on.",
    "And so that's what really attracted me.",
    "Finally, what is the biggest challenge you think you're going to face in the Major Leagues...",
    "...compared to the Japanese League?",
    "Everything is going to be a challenge not just on the field but off the field as well.",
    "So, hopefully when that day comes when I can put up some good numbers...",
    "...and help the team, it's probably going to be a sort of like an icing on the cake...",
    "...where it's going to be even more satisfying when I can get to that point.",
    "So, I'm really looking forward to doing everything I can to help the team...",
    "...and help the team in any way I can."
