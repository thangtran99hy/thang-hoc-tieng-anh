    "There are certain things you should avoid while writing your resume.",
    "For one, don't use templates of people who have substantial years of experience.",
    "You do not need to put in your postal address or mention outdated qualifications.",
    "Also remember, whatever the reason for your resume,...",
    "...it should never be longer than a single-sided page.",
    "You do not need to include a photograph...",
    "...unless you're applying in a country where this is a requirement.",
    "Although this goes without saying, do not plagiarize someone else's resume."
