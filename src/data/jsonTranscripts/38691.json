    "So, Amy, I hear you want to go to university next year.",
    "Well, I'm not sure I do now.",
    "The fees are really high and I can't afford it.",
    "But anyway, I don't think I should have to pay.",
    "I think university should be free for everybody.",
    "Hmmm.",
    "Well, that's one way of looking at it.",
    "What do you think, Jackie?",
    "I agree with Amy.",
    "Schools are free.",
    "So, why aren't universities?",
    "That's why we pay our taxes, isn't it?",
    "I think all education should be free.",
    "I'm not sure about that.",
    "Everyone knows graduates get better jobs which means they get higher salaries.",
    "So, I think they should pay something for their education.",
    "I'm sorry.",
    "I don't agree.",
    "We didn't have to pay university fees, Matt.",
    "So, why should Amy?",
    "That's true, but we were at university a long time ago.",
    "Yeah, about 50 years ago, wasn't it?",
    "Not quite that long."
