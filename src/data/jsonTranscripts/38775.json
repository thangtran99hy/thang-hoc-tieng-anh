    "Oh! Hi, Mike! How are you?",
    "I'm fine, and you?",
    "Oh, that's good.",
    "Oh! So, do you need my daughter Martina for a children's commercial?",
    "Oh, she will be wonderful for that.",
    "Well, let me tell you a little bit about her.",
    "She's a beautiful girl.",
    "She is ten. She is tall and she's thin.",
    "She has blue eyes and has blond, medium-sized hair.",
    "Uh-huh. Yeah.",
    "She's also a lovable, kind and funny girl.",
    "Yes, she's very funny.",
    "She loves to tell jokes.",
    "Uh-huh. Yeah.",
    "She also loves to skate, to sing and to play the piano.",
    "So, I think she would be perfect for your commercial.",
    "I'll be sending you a picture of her.",
    "Okay? So, I'll talk to you later.",
    "Take care. Bye!"
