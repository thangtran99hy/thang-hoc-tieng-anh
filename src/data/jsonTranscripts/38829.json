    "It all starts with a push.",
    "A push that starts from nothing yet leads to everything.",
    "Was that okay?",
    "A push that goes from riding hills to backyard pools to straight up walls.",
    "Pushing through skinned knees and broken bones.",
    "Over cracked pavement, busted ramps and that single pebble.",
    "It's a push that turns a 360, into a 720 into a 900.",
    "We used to see ourselves as a family of misfits.",
    "But now, the world will call us Olympians."
