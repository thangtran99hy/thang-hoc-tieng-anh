    "Hey, thanks for making time.",
    "Did you have a chance to read through my email?",
    "Absolutely! But before we dive in, I wanted to ask:...",
    "You're usually pretty quiet during our team meetings...",
    "...and then you follow up after, like today.",
    "I would really love to see you more engaged in those meetings.",
    "What do you think holds you back?",
    "I know. It's just... in production, we're very process-driven.",
    "I like to get my head around things before I say too much.",
    "Okay.",
    "And you seem so psyched about things.",
    "I didn't want to be a downer in front of the team.",
    "I totally get it.",
    "Sometimes, I'm overexcited.",
    "But the numbers show that our old approach isn't working.",
    "I'm hoping this new approach can get us back on track.",
    "I get that, we do need a new approach.",
    "So, why don't we do this:...",
    "Why don't I make sure that you have a little more of a heads-up...",
    "...before I roll out something new.",
    "That'd be awesome.",
    "And maybe you can jump in a little more...",
    "...even if you haven't quite thought it all through.",
    "Okay, I can do that.",
    "Perfect! And if you think of anything before the meeting...",
    "...you can always send it to me and I can be sure to add it to the agenda...",
    "...so we can be sure to discuss it.",
    "That'd be great.",
    "I think that works for everybody.",
    "Nice."
