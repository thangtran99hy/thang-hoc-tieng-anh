    "Hi, my name is Lily Bond.",
    "I'm the director of marketing here at 3Play Media.",
    "And on a daily basis, I work with all types of marketing content.",
    "So, I do blogs, I do white papers.",
    "I do webinars all the time, go to a lot of conferences,...",
    "...and then I manage our team and all of our marketing operations.",
    "So, we produce closed captions and transcripts,...",
    "...which is an accommodation for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.",
    "And my favorite part of my job is that I get to help people.",
    "My days are never the same.",
    "So, one thing that's great about 3Play, for me at least,...",
    "...is the diversity of things that I'm working on.",
    "I never like doing the same thing over and over again.",
    "So, on one day, I might be writing a new blog post.",
    "On another day, I might be producing a webinar.",
    "On another day, I might be travelling across the country to a conference.",
    "And then I get to meet with people from all different teams in the company...",
    "...and work on new product releases.",
    "And I find it really exciting."
