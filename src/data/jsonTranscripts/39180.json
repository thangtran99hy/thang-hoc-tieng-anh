    "Hello?",
    "Hey, Tom! This is Patrick from TikTok.",
    "How are you doing today?",
    "Hey, Patrick! I'm doing fine.",
    "What is this about again?",
    "Well actually, Tom, I'm a little lost.",
    "Do you mind if I take a second to tell you why I'm calling?",
    "Yeah, sure.",
    "All right, great.",
    "I'm actually from the strategic partnerships team at TikTok,...",
    "...and basically what I do is I help gaming studios just like yours,...",
    "...reach new audiences by advertising on our platform.",
    "And I'm sure you're already familiar with TikTok, right?",
    "Oh yeah, that's where everyone's doing those trendy dances, right?",
    "Yep, exactly.",
    "Well, not only are we known for our trendy dances,...",
    "...but I've actually been supporting a lot of mobile gaming companies...",
    "...advertise on our platform,...",
    "...and helping them get more downloads on the App Store, and the Google Play Store.",
    "And the reason I'm calling is because I want to take five minutes...",
    "...to see if it makes sense for us to work together in any way,...",
    "...and see if you would be interested in advertising on our platform at all.",
    "Now, by the end of the call, if we find that,...",
    "...hey, maybe it makes sense for us to work together,...",
    "...great, we can move on to what the next step would be.",
    "But if not, totally fine.",
    "Does that sound fair to you?",
    "Okay sure. Sounds fair to me."
