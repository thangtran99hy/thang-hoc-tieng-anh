    "One of my jobs as the leader of Amazon is to encourage people to be bold.",
    "And people love to focus on things that aren't yet working.",
    "And that's good, it's human nature.",
    "That kind of divine discontent can be very helpful,...",
    "...but it's incredibly hard to get people to take bold bets.",
    "You need to encourage that.",
    "And if you're gonna take bold bets, they're gonna be experiments.",
    "And if they're experiments, you don't know ahead of time if they're gonna work.",
    "Experiments are by their very nature prone to failure,...",
    "...but a few big successes compensate for dozens and dozens of things that didn't work."
