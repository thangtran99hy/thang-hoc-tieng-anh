    "...I left knowing like, OK, I'm going to have to put together a portfolio...",
    "...to kind of show off some of these different skills that they were looking for,...",
    "...be it Photoshop or photography or copywriting.",
    "So, I went home and put myself to task.",
    "I grabbed the one S'well bottle I had and started going around the city...",

    "...taking videos or GIFs of my S'well bottle...",

    "I don't think it can ever hurt to express that you're really passionate about it,...",
    "...and you're very eager to learn and very determined to have that job.",
