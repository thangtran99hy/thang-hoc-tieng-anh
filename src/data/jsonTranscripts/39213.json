    "Is life worth living?",
    "Yes, so long as there is wrong to right,...",
    "Wail of the weak against the strong,...",
    "Or tyranny to fight;...",
    "Long as there lingers gloom to chase,...",
    "Or streaming tear to dry,...",
    "One kindred woe, one sorrowing face...",
    "That smiles as we draw nigh:...",
    "Long as a tale of anguish swells the heart,...",
    "...and lids grow wet,...",
    "And at the sound of Christmas bells...",
    "We pardon and forget;...",
    "So long as faith with freedom reigns,...",
    "And loyal hope survives,...",
    "And gracious charity remains...",
    "To leaven lowly lives;...",
    "While there is one untrodden tract...",
    "For intellect or will,...",
    "And men are free to think and act...",
    "Life is worth living still."
