    "A few years ago, French researchers carried out a simple but powerful experiment.",
    "They approached people in the street,...",
    "...explained that they just parked their car, and now needed some coins for the parking meter.",
    "The researchers explained that they only had a banknote...",
    "...and they asked the person if they could give them change for the note.",
    "Sometimes, they conducted the study when the sun was shining...",
    "...and other times when it was cloudy.",
    "On sunny days, 22 percent of the people helped...",
    "...compared to just 14 percent on the cloudy days.",
    "Why?",
    "Because the sun puts people in a positive mood...",
    "...and we're far more likely to help others when we're feeling good.",
    "So, next time you need a favor, you want somebody to go on a date with you...",
    "...or you need a raise from your boss,...",
    "...remember to ask when the sun is shining."
