    "Chris, so about this price for this series of training courses, 4,200.",
    "Unfortunately, we can't afford that.",
    "Is there any way you could come down a little bit?",
    "Well, if you book several courses in advance...",
    "...then I could reduce the price by 45 dollars per course,...",
    "...which would save us 180 dollars.",
    "So, I could come down to 4,020.",
    "How about that?",
    "I really can only afford 2,800 dollars on this course,...",
    "...but if you did some tailoring to our company,...",
    "...I'm sure that I can convince my boss to pay 3,200.",
    "Yeah, I can't come down to 3,200,...",
    "...but what I'm thinking is, if you kept the numbers per course to 12 people or fewer,...",
    "...then I could bring it down from 4,020 to 3,840.",
    "How about that?",
    "It's still a little bit high,...",
    "...but maybe you could write some specific role plays for our company...",
    "...that we could use internally after the program.",
    "Yeah.",
    "And if you could include a copy of the Happiness book, which I hear is brilliant,...",
    "...we could do an extra five dollars a head...",
    "...and I think that would bring us to 3,650, which is what we can afford.",
    "Thirty-six fifty, I tell you what, if we could make the third day a half day rather than a full day,...",
    "...that would be useful to me...",
    "...and I could still make sure we covered all the material you need covered.",
    "So, if we could do that, then I could come down to your figure of 3,650.",
    "Perfect! All right, you got yourself a deal.",
    "Great!",
    "Thank you."
