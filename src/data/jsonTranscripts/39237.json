    "It's amazing! Every detail is taken care of.",
    "If you look in the windows, you can see all the dishes and cups.",
    "The great thing about this tour...",
    "...is whether or not you know anything about Lord of the Rings,...",
    "...it's a little fairy tale world that you can immerse yourself in.",
