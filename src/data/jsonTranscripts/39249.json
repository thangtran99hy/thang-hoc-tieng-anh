    "...is more of a consultative leadership style...",
    "...where I, especially if I have good employees,...",
    "...I consult individually with a lot of my employees to get their two cents on the situation...",
    "...and what they feel is the right course of action...",

    "...where you get everybody together and you hammer it out.",
    "You get everybody's opinion on it and it kind of goes back and forth...",
    "...and that tends to work very well if you know it's a very complex decision...",
    "...that affects everybody in multiple ways.",
    "You know, so that's something that I've employed on occasion."
