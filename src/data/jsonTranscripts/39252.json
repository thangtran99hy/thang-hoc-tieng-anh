    "How would you deal with conflict between two team members?",
    "Whenever I come in to a new organization and take up a position as a supervisor,...",
    "...one of the first things I will do is sit down with the team,...",
    "...I will lay out my standards and expectations,...",
    "...and I will say to them,...",
    "...\"If you encounter conflict, you should be able to resolve it yourselves initially.\"",
    "I would then observe what happens moving forward.",
    "And if it quickly becomes apparent that that conflict isn't getting resolved,...",
    "...then I would step in and I would resolve it.",
    "And to achieve that, I would sit down with each of the team members...",
    "...to find out what has happened.",
    "I would never jump to conclusions.",
    "I would ask them questions to get to the bottom of the situation.",
    "And I would then put a plan of action in place...",
    "...to get them to resolve it or I would make the decision for them.",
    "And again, my decision on how I want them to act within their roles...",
    "...would be based on helping the organization achieve its objectives.",
    "So, I have the confidence to deal with conflict quickly.",
    "And if the team members aren't resolving it,...",
    "...then I will certainly step in...",
    "...because  any conflict can have a negative impact on the performance of my team...",
    "...and that would not be acceptable."
