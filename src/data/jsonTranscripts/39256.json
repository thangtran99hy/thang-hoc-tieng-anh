    "Thank you for coming in today.",
    "We appreciate you're taking the time to interview with us for a position with our firm...",
    "...and I hope it's a good experience for both of us.",
    "Let me just take a few seconds and explain how this will flow.",
    "My job, if you will, is to learn as much about you as I can...",
    "...and in a fairly short period of time.",
    "That will mean that you'll have to do most of the talking...",
    "...and hopefully we can guide through that in a way that touches on things...",
    "...that you think are really important.",
    "While we're talking, I should add that I might make a few notes...",
    "...and I hope that won't be distracting,...",
    "...but it will help me and the rest of us who discuss candidates later on...",
    "...since we interview so many people in any given day."
