    "Can you tell me about a time when you suffered a setback...",
    "...and had to maintain your enthusiasm?",
    "Sure, one definitely comes to mind.",
    "Last year, a project for a new toy was in its final stages after two years of work.",
    "As we were looking at the branding and working up a final marketing plan,...",
    "...a competitor launched a version of the exact same toy that we were launching.",
    "As the leader of the project, I knew that my reaction would set the tone for the group.",
    "I acknowledged that it was a setback,...",
    "...but challenged the group to think of this as a blessing in disguise.",
    "I asked them to go out and buy the competitor's product...",
    "...and make a list of anything they wished the toy could do that it didn't.",
    "It turned out that the list was pretty long.",
    "We added these items to our toy, and launched a far superior product six months later.",
    "So, in many ways, the competitor's product became the key to our success.",
    "That sounds like a great victory."
