    "Oh, hi!",
    "I just got some new advice from this book \"Flip-Flops and Microwaved Fish\"...",
    "...about socializing with people at work.",
    "Recently, I've heard that a lot of teams are doing after-work cocktail hours...",
    "...where you're supposed to bring your own cocktail...",
    "...and not talk about things related to work.",
    "But, my advice for you is don't feel that you have to drink an alcoholic beverage...",
    "...or talk about anything that's personal to you...",
    "...like your alcoholic dad or your humorless, clueless ex-wife.",
    "Just feel comfortable talking about things you want to talk about...",
    "...like a new smoothie recipe.",
    "Oh man! That's awful!",
    "Who made this?"
