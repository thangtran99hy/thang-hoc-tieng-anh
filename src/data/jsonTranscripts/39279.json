    "It's extremely poisonous...",
    "...and it's really dangerous...",
    "...and I can show you statistics and experiments...",
    "...that prove that my product doesn't only clean better than those, but it's safer.",

    "ScieoClean is the best cleaning product that's ever been invented.",
    "It's completely natural.",
    "It's completely safe...",
    "...and it cleans better that any product on the market.",
    "If any of my competitors are making the same claim,...",
    "...all I say is come on TV and drink your product.",
    "But I don't think you will."
