    "So, thus far we're really happy with how you've been.",
    "Do you have any questions for where we're headed...",
    "...and the role that you've been doing so far?",

    "I want to also discuss your development plan...",
    "...and how you think you're traveling with that so far.",
    "In regard to other skills, other areas that you like to learn more about,...",
    "...can you tell me anything about that?",
    "If I'm honest, I'd quite like to be a bit better on Excel...",
    "...so if you've got any courses on that, that'd be really helpful to me.",
    "Emma, we really want to focus on your career progression here at the company...",
    "...so, any way we can help your work, we're more than happy to do so."
