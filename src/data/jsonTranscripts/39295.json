    "When the waters began to rise and war broke out,...",
    "...nostalgia became a way of life.",
    "There wasn't a lot to look forward to, so people began looking back.",
    "Nothing is more addictive than the past.",
    "No, no, no, no, put me back.",
    "Put me back.",
    "She has moved on and you should too.",
    "People don't just vanish.",
    "To find where she'd gone, I had to know where she'd been.",
    "Don't go down this path.",
    "Stay here, in this life.",
    "How close can you get before the illusion is broken?",
    "You're going on a journey.",
    "All you have to do is follow my voice."
