    "What the holidays give is meant to be shared.",
    "It's the new traditions that lift us up...",
    "...and the way our celebrations are prepared.",
    "It's making room for all so that our world doesn't feel so small.",
    "It's when moments of light bring us closer than before...",
    "...and illuminate those we do it for."
