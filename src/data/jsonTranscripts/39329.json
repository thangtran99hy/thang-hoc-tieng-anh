    "How do you like my new bike?",
    "What is it?",
    "Oh, right.",
    "I see.",
    "Yes, I know.",

    "Big, huge, enormous, gigantic!",
    "All four words have the same meaning.",
    "Do you know how we call words that mean the same...",
    "...or are very similar to other words?",
    "We call them synonyms!",
    "You can switch one word for the other as often as you like,...",

    "...no matter how similar they may be.",
    "Hello, Mr. Hippo.",
    "I heard you'd be explaining synonyms today,...",
    "...so I came straight away to listen.",
    "Sorry, I'm so late; I think I have a question for you.",
    "Why do we learn synonyms, Mr. Hippo?",
    "That's easy, my friend.",
    "We learn synonyms to express ourselves in more ways than one can,...",
    "...to make our writing more interesting and lively...",
    "...like painting a picture in the mind of the reader.",
    "Instead of paintbrushes and colors, we use words.",
    "Let me try.",
    "So I could say that...",
    "...I'm not just small, I'm so little and tiny!",
    "Teeny, tiny actually.",
    "You're really getting the hang of it, aren't you?",
    "You described yourself so nicely.",
    "Good job, my friend!"
