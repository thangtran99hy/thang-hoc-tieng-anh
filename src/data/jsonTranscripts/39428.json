    "Mr. Smith, can you please give me your best offer?",
    "Sure, Mr. Mark.",
    "I can give you fifteen seconds of airtime for 2,500 dollars if you sign a contract for one hundred such ads.",
    "But, your price is too high.",
    "I am getting a quote for 2,000 dollars from a rival network.",
    "There's a good reason.",
    "Their viewership is also 30 percent smaller than ours.",
    "It actually works out to be more expensive.",
    "Well, I never negotiated the deal with them.",
    "Let's do this: give me a rate of 2,000 dollars, and I'll sign the contract.",
    "I don't think we can afford it.",
    "Check it up with your boss.",
    "I am sure he'll give you a go-ahead."
