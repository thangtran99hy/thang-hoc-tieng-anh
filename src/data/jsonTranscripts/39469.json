    "In straight turning, the tool is fed parallel to the axis of the work...",
    "...to reduce its diameter so that the final diameter is the same at each end.",
    "Removing a significant amount of material in one pass is called rough turning.",
    "The final lighter cut that creates a smooth surface finish...",
    "...is called finish turning.",
    "Taper turning produces a taper along the axis of the workpiece.",
    "Tapers are produced by offsetting the tailstock from center line...",
    "...or by using a taper attachment.",
    "Short, steep tapers can be turned using a compound rest.",
    "Contour turning or profiling was formally performed...",
    "...by having the single point cutting tool...",
    "...trace a template of the desired profile shape.",
    "This has largely been replaced by CNC turning,...",
    "...in which the desired contour is simply programmed into the machine,...",
    "...which directs a cutting tool to cut the contour."
