    "If there's one question I get asked a lot, it is why do I wear so many dresses...",
    "...or why do I have so many dresses, or why do I love wearing dresses.",
    "Let's start with the first reason: they are comfortable.",
    "A lot of people out there are always talking about how dresses are so uncomfortable...",
    "...and they don't like wearing them...",
    "...and, that is totally fine.",
    "For me, it is what I am most comfortable in.",
    "Just know that I will choose a flowy dress over jeans.",
    "And, when I go shopping for dresses, there are no issues...",
    "...because I already know what works for my body type.",
    "I know what styles I like, what styles look good on me...",
    "...and what styles I feel confident in.",
    "Plus, they're just so much more comfortable."
