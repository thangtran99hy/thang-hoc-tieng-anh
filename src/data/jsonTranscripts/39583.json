    "I find them a little too casual.",
    "Well, there are other styles too.",
    "Look!",
    "What's your favorite color?",
    "I like all colors except navy blue.",
    "Actually, I really hate navy blue...",
    "...because it reminds me too much of my old school uniform.",
    "How about suits?",
    "Is there a color that you don't like at all?",
    "Well, I don't really like light-colored suits.",
    "You're right.",
    "Light colors are no longer fashionable.",
    "Are white shirts too traditional for you?",
    "Not at all.",
    "Actually, I prefer a suit and tie for important occasions.",
    "Well then, why don't you buy a white shirt and a brightly colored tie?",
    "It's the perfect outfit to create a good impression."
