    "Tokyo is a huge city full of energy and excitement.",
    "But when I was 22, I was diagnosed with a progressive muscular disease.",
    "I've been in a wheelchair since the age of 26.",
    "When my son was born, I wanted to stay positive for him.",
    "As a wheelchair user with the right information,...",
    "...you can still have fun as a family.",
    "So I started WheeLog!,...",
    "...a platform anyone can contribute to.",
    "You can use the app before you head out to check accessibility.",
    "When I started using a wheelchair, going out was a bit scary,...",
    "...but since using WheeLog!, I started to enjoy it.",
    "By continuing this work, I believe we can achieve a barrier-free world."
