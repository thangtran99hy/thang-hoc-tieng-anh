    "Hi, friends.",
    "How are you?",
    "Today we are going to learn the prepositions of place...",
    "...to know how to say where things are.",
    "Mary, I need your help.",
    "I have to pack, and I cannot find anything. Please!",
    "You are a disaster, Tio English!",
    "What do you need to find?",
    "I'm looking for my red shoes.",
    "Let me see!",
    "They are here, in front of the sofa.",
    "And where will the umbrella be?",
    "It might rain!",
    "It's here, behind the door.",
    "And the camera, I cannot find it.",
    "Take it!",
    "It was next to the TV, beside the TV.",
    "Wow, thanks!",
    "What more?",
    "Where is the laptop?",
    "The computer is on the table.",
    "Where did I leave the cell phone?",
    "Call me, please.",
    "Here, it was under the cushions.",
    "What a mess!"
