    "Outsider art is a tricky field to define and sort of quantify.",
    "We tend to define outsider art...",
    "...as art by people who aren't formally trained...",
    "...and who work outside of academic circles.",
    "Sometimes people are kept out of the mainstream art world...",
    "...because of who they are where they live.",
    "One of the great things about outsider art...",
    "...is that you're looking at a lot of artists who drew their inspiration...",
    "...from religion, from popular culture, from general visual culture,...",
    "...from their communities.",
    "It gives us access to understanding a little bit more...",
    "...about what life was like for a lot of these artists."
