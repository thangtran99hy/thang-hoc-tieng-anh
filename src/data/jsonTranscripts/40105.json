    "A lot of times I get asked how I got so lucky...",
    "...and how I was able to start traveling the world.",
    "Are my parents rich?",
    "However, the truth is relatively quite simple.",
    "Two years ago, I made the decision to start chasing my dreams...",
    "...and to never look back.",
    "To not have a plan.",
    "It was not easy and I had many doubts.",
    "I worked many little jobs to save up and eventually I started traveling.",
    "Even though the journey wasn't easy, I never looked back.",
    "And deep down I believed that if there's something you're truly passionate about,...",
    "...nothing should stop you.",
    "And that if you keep chasing your dreams,...",
    "...eventually all the pieces fall into place."
