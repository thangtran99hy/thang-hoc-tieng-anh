    "This is my workstation.",
    "There are many things on my table.",
    "There is a computer screen, a keyboard, and a mouse.",

    "There is a brown speaker beside my computer screen.",
    "It is cheap, but I like its design.",

    "There is also a lamp beside my computer screen, on the other side.",
    "It is expensive, but I like it a lot, so I bought it."
