    "It's exciting to really change the aesthetics of technology.",
    "If you think about it, people today have to sort of almost choose...",
    "...between aesthetics and beauty and technology.",
    "Those are orthogonal directions.",
    "What's happening now is these two worlds are coming together.",
    "And this class is preparing students...",
    "...to be able to combine the world of aesthetics,...",

    "...to create your overall structure and your final product.",

    "...and get early warnings of changes in your health,...",
    "...we've just published some work on fabrics that could help listen, to help hear;...",
    "...people that have impairments in hearing,...",
    "...fabrics that could listen to the unborn.",
    "And so what we're doing is converting the fabric...",
    "...from just being what it has always been...",
    "...to something that plays a very meaningful role in our lives."
