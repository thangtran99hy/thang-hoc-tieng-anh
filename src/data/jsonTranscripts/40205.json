    "Hi, Lisa.",
    "I can't find some of my things.",
    "I need your help.",
    "What do you need to find?",
    "I'm looking for my pen.",
    "Have you seen it?",
    "It was on the table next to yours, on your notebook.",
    "And how about my phone?",
    "Have you also seen it?",
    "It was also on the table, next to the notebook.",
    "Oh, right.",
    "I left them there.",
    "I keep forgetting things, thanks Lisa."
