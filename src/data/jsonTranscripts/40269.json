    "How many times can I ride the bus with a pass?",

    "You just need to buy a pass each month.",
    "That sounds like a better option.",
    "Do you have a business card?",
    "They give a discount for office workers.",
    "Oh, wow.",
    "Yes, I have.",
    "Let me see.",
    "You should go to the ticket booth and show them your card.",
    "They will give you a discount.",
    "That's great.",
    "Thank you.",
    "You're welcome."
