    "Oda's world is so unique.",
    "Seeing all of this stuff in person,...",
    "...being able to reach out and touch it, has just been such an experience.",
    "Our crews down here in South Africa are incredible,...",
    "...and it's been so rewarding to see them taking Oda's world and bringing it to life.",
    "Because of the level of detail and attention that goes into all of these sets,...",
    "...they take a good amount of time.",
    "And right now, we're building Arlong's map room,...",
    "...and it's already been a couple of weeks,...",
    "...but it's a big build because it's a really important location.",
    "A lot of drama goes down in there.",
    "A lot of action goes down in there.",
    "So we have to get it just right."
