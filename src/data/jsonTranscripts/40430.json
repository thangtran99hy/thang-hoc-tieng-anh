    "From my many wanderings on this earth...",
    "...I had so much to say about imperfect fathers and imperfect sons...",
    "...and about loss and love.",
    "I've learned that there are old spirits...",
    "...who rarely involve themselves in the human world.",
    "But on occasion, they do.",
    "I want to tell you a story.",
    "It's a story you may think you know, but you don't.",
    "A story of the wooden boy."
