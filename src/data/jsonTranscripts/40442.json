    "Oh, it was a complete shock,...",
    "...and I have to say, pretty much instant recognition...",
    "...and we thought, my goodness, there he is.",
    "We have his hat and his beard, signature neckerchief around his neck...",
    "...and it just struck us immediately that it was a self-portrait.",
    "As a poor artist, Van Gogh used both sides of the canvas to save money,...",
