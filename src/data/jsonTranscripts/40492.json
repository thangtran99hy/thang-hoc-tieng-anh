    "...and all of a sudden, the assistant looked at Albert Einstein and said,...",
    "...\"Dr. Einstein, this exam which you just gave...",
    "...to the senior class of physics students,...",
    "...isn't that exactly the same exam you gave to...",
    "...exactly the same class one year ago?\"",
