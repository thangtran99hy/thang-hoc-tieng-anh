    "Earlier this year, we became owners of a football club in Wrexham.",
    "Do you feel like you know what you're doing?",
    "Absolutely not.",
    "Football means everything to people in this town.",
    "It's not life and death, it's more important than that.",
    "The team becomes an extension of the city.",
    "The hype is massive, and the town desperately needs it.",
    "This is a fun game."
