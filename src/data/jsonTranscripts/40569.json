    "Hi. I see you're on the internet.",
    "Do you like it here?",

    "What about a photo that feels kind of shopped?",
    "Or maybe you just read about a celebrity clone?",
    "Oh, the internet is such an adventure.",
    "Ever wish everyone could navigate this place a little better?",
    "It's easy.",
    "Just tell them to search before they share with Google.",
    "Did I mention this is a Google thing?",
    "With the right tools, we can all get to the bottom of that shady pic,...",
    "...investigate a suspicious source and run stuff by expert fact checkers.",
    "Doesn't that sound fun?",
    "I'm having fun.",
    "What do you say we make the internet better together?",
    "All right. Bye!"
