    "Tom Brady, the ageless quarterback.",
    "I was away from the game for almost two years.",
    "He didn't make two months.",
    "But you know what that tells me?",
    "How much he wants it.",
    "How much he needs it.",
    "Especially against them Cowboys,...",
    "...who have never beaten him.",
    "We'll see y'all in the game, trust me.",
    "Because greatness like this doesn't come along that often.",
    "He's back.",
    "Let's go!"
