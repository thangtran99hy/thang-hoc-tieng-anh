    "This is not only an important day; it is a very special day for us...",
    "...because it goes back to the year 1900...",
    "...when one of our founders, Charles Rolls, made a prophecy,...",
    "...and that prophecy was that electric drive is a perfect fit because it's clean,...",
    "...it's noiseless and once charging is able and is fixed of charging problem,...",
    "...then this is the ideal propulsion for a car.",
    "The reason why we went electric is that clients love it.",
    "Clients want to move emission-free in city centers in a Rolls-Royce.",
    "This is quite appealing.",
    "I think it is one jigsaw in a bigger puzzle of our long-term sustainability.",
    "So it's not meant to be \"This washes now the brand in any way green.\"",
    "Not at all."
