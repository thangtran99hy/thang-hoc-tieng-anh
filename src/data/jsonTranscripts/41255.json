    "MIT Dog Swim is our opportunity to open up a swim event...",
    "...for our four-legged friends in the MIT and extended community.",
    "I like the fact that we're doing something different...",
    "...other than the standard swimming leagues of the pool...",
    "...and running swim meets.",
    "Oh, it's super fun.",
    "I think it's really cool that they offer this, especially in the winter.",
    "I'm a little jealous I don't get to go in,...",
    "...but I think it's a really, really neat opportunity for the dogs.",
    "I can't lie; this is the best day at any job I've ever had."
