    "For all the little boys and girls who look like me watching tonight,...",
    "...this is a beacon of hope and possibilities.",
    "This is proof that dreams dream big and dreams do come true.",
    "And, ladies, don't let anybody tell you, you are ever past your prime.",
    "I have to dedicate this to my mom, all the moms in the world,...",
    "...because they are really the superheroes.",
    "And without them, none of us will be here tonight."
