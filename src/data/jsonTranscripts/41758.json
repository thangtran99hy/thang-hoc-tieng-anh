    "We run for our homes, for our families, for the next generation.",
    "To help put our foot down on plastic waste and stand out for what's right.",
    "It's time to run for the oceans.",
    "And show the ones who have given up while we never will.",
    "Oh my gosh.",
    "Oh my gosh.",

    "In and out.",
    "Oh my gosh.",
    "We'll do it step by step, minute by minute, bottle by bottle.",

    "It might be impossible to do on our own.",
    "But together, impossible is nothing."
