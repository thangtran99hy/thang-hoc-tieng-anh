    "Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.",
    "We have decided to discontinue the approach into Singapore Changi Airport...",
    "...and this was because I was informed...",
    "...that we still have got passengers...",
    "...who are not seated with your seatbelts securely fastened,...",
    "...and we are legally not able to land an aircraft if the cabin isn't secure.",
    "We are now turning around again for another approach,...",
    "...and if we have to do another missed approach for the same reason,...",
    "...the airport police will be involved and they will take the necessary action."
