Tom Brady, the quarterback of the New England Patriots...

00:02.856 --> 00:05.186
...is not only one of the NFL's best players,...

00:05.588 --> 00:07.790
...he's one of the NFL's great stories.

00:08.320 --> 00:09.647
At the tender age of 30,...

00:09.765 --> 00:11.579
...he has already won 3 Super Bowls,...

00:11.648 --> 00:14.377
...an accomplishment that ranks him with some of the best quarterbacks...

00:14.679 --> 00:15.625
...ever to play the game.

00:16.190 --> 00:19.097
And he is having one of the greatest seasons in pro football history.

00:20.017 --> 00:22.827
When we first reported on him back in 2005,...

00:23.273 --> 00:25.401
...he seemed underrated and almost overlooked.

00:26.125 --> 00:29.196
He doesn't have the arm of Peyton Manning and he doesn't have tattoos.

00:29.505 --> 00:30.805
And he doesn't take steroids,...

00:31.049 --> 00:32.535
...and he's never held out for more money.

00:33.236 --> 00:34.935
All he knows how to do is win.

00:35.571 --> 00:39.739
Former football greats say he exemplifies what the American athlete should be.

00:40.399 --> 00:42.448
Yet, he barely made it to the NFL at all.

00:43.037 --> 00:45.157
For much of his high school and college careers,...

00:45.454 --> 00:48.094
...he was a second stringer, battling for the starting job.

00:48.747 --> 00:51.657
He wasn't picked until the sixth round of the NFL draft.

00:52.119 --> 00:54.186
The 199th player chosen.
