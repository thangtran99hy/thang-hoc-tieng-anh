What did you and your friends do last night?

00:02.755 --> 00:03.777
We went to Fenway Park...

00:03.921 --> 00:05.455
...to see the Sox play the Yankees.

00:05.911 --> 00:06.756
That's great!

00:07.087 --> 00:07.739
How was the game?

00:08.110 --> 00:09.058
It was awesome!

00:09.449 --> 00:10.413
Dice-K was pitching.

00:10.699 --> 00:12.116
He struck out twelve batters!

00:12.501 --> 00:13.447
He was on fire!

00:14.150 --> 00:15.795
So, did the Red Sox win the game?

00:16.207 --> 00:16.975
They sure did!

00:17.273 --> 00:19.471
Pedroia hit a two-run home run in the ninth inning.

00:19.951 --> 00:22.001
Sounds like you saw a terrific game.
