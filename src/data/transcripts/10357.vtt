00:00.400 --> 00:03.040
I'm going to visit New York City on my next vacation.

00:03.860 --> 00:06.270
First on my agenda is going to a Broadway show.

00:06.650 --> 00:09.175
And after that I want to explore Central Park.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.550
I heard you can ice skate there in the winter!

00:12.010 --> 00:13.850
I also want to cross the Brooklyn Bridge,...

00:14.250 --> 00:16.670
...and see the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor.

00:17.570 --> 00:19.230
I won't have a car while I'm there,...

00:19.720 --> 00:22.600
...but there are a lot of ways for tourists to get around New York.

00:23.340 --> 00:25.510
You can take a train from Grand Central Station,...

00:26.050 --> 00:28.035
...or ride the subway to most points in the city.

00:28.710 --> 00:31.400
I hope I can see all these things in only three days!
