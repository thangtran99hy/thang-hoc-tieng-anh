So, Sophie. We've been dating for a year now.

00:03.951 --> 00:07.157
I know! Let's have a toast to our first year.

00:07.897 --> 00:08.370
Cheers.

00:09.139 --> 00:12.191
Cheers! Here's to one whole year together.

00:12.712 --> 00:14.110
You make me so happy.

00:14.517 --> 00:15.974
I think we make a great couple!

00:17.014 --> 00:19.241
Sophie, I wanted to ask you something.

00:20.403 --> 00:23.795
Sure. What is it, Aaron? You look nervous!

00:24.554 --> 00:26.305
Well, Sophie, I was wondering...

00:26.635 --> 00:27.120
Yes!

00:27.731 --> 00:28.293
Yes?

00:28.973 --> 00:30.362
Yes! I'll marry you!

00:30.911 --> 00:33.276
Oh! I was going to ask you...

00:33.453 --> 00:36.680
...if you wanted your Christmas present tonight or tomorrow.
