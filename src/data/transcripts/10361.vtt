My name is Kai-Fu Lee,...

00:02.400 --> 00:05.950
...I'm Chinese-American. I was born in Taiwan.

00:06.200 --> 00:08.950
I am the president of Google Greater China.

00:09.400 --> 00:15.200
I think this is a tremendous time to have this confluence of the two amazing cultures.

00:16.100 --> 00:19.200
I feel, to be successful in this 21st century,...

00:19.450 --> 00:26.100
...you really have to combine the Asian wisdom of perseverance, of humility...

00:26.400 --> 00:32.500
...and along with the American characteristics of courage and proactivity.

00:33.250 --> 00:36.200
Many Asian-Americans, I think in the past...

00:36.350 --> 00:39.700
...have worked more on assimilating into America...

00:39.950 --> 00:41.700
...which I think is certainly important.

00:41.950 --> 00:45.400
But I think with the emergence of Asia,...

00:45.450 --> 00:49.800
...it's also important, I think for the Asian-Americans that are growing up...

00:50.050 --> 00:51.600
...not to forget their roots.

00:51.800 --> 00:57.600
Not only is it really critical to help them become leaders of the 21st century...

00:57.900 --> 01:05.100
...but also it will help them in their pursuit of their careers and dreams.

01:05.250 --> 01:09.600
Because Asia is emerging so quickly, there are so many opportunities.

01:09.750 --> 01:14.700
So, Asian-Americans really should grasp this unique opportunity.

01:15.050 --> 01:17.400
Not just to think about the assimilation...

01:17.650 --> 01:23.600
...but also about how to leverage the great heritage that they have.
