Hi guys, it's Helen.

00:18.585 --> 00:21.350
I heard from Ben today that you both have the flu.

00:21.850 --> 00:23.590
It seems to be going around.

00:24.420 --> 00:26.495
My sister also got it last week.

00:26.755 --> 00:28.325
I hope you'll feel better soon.

00:28.835 --> 00:30.265
Let me know if you need anything.

00:30.945 --> 00:32.770
Okay, take care! Bye-bye!
