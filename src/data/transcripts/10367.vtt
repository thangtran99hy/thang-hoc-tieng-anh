You can't buy any decent clothes in Springfield.

00:03.595 --> 00:05.720
I'm so bored of the stores here.

00:06.400 --> 00:09.660
I prefer to browse the Goodwill store for used clothing.

00:10.395 --> 00:13.815
If you really look, you can get lucky and find something nice.

00:14.660 --> 00:18.470
The other day, I came across this beautiful cashmere scarf.

00:18.950 --> 00:20.920
It turned out to be a Burberry!

00:22.155 --> 00:23.840
It was like new, too!

00:24.555 --> 00:28.125
I bought it for just three dollars and went home, all happy.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.900
I love that store sometimes!

00:31.620 --> 00:35.500
The only thing was that the scarf had a slightly musty smell.
