What seems to be the problem with our friend Daniel today?

00:02.965 --> 00:08.520
He's been coughing a lot, he's tired all the time, he has no appetite.

00:08.850 --> 00:10.770
Uh-huh. Is he running a fever?

00:11.100 --> 00:15.315
Yes, he is. It was 103.7 when I checked last.

00:15.560 --> 00:19.585
Hmm. It could be the flu, but I'd like to see him just to be sure.

00:20.220 --> 00:22.955
Can you bring him in this afternoon at three?

00:23.540 --> 00:25.770
At three? Yes, I can do that.

00:26.410 --> 00:27.360
Thank you, doctor!

00:27.670 --> 00:28.400
You're welcome!

00:28.760 --> 00:30.530
See you at three. Bye!
