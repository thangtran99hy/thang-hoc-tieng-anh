00:00.700 --> 00:03.550
So is English mania good or bad?

00:03.850 --> 00:08.000
Is English a tsunami, washing away other languages?

00:08.300 --> 00:09.200
Not likely.

00:09.450 --> 00:11.900
English is the world's second language.

00:12.450 --> 00:14.450
Your native language is your life.

00:14.500 --> 00:18.450
But with English you can become part of a wider conversation.

00:18.700 --> 00:22.350
A global conversation about global problems.

00:22.550 --> 00:27.450
Like climate change or poverty, or hunger, or disease.

00:27.900 --> 00:31.300
The world has other universal languages.

00:31.400 --> 00:34.050
Mathematics is the language of science.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.100
Music is the language of emotions.

00:37.450 --> 00:41.800
And now English is becoming the language of problem solving.

00:41.950 --> 00:44.200
Not because America is pushing it.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.950
But because the world is pulling it.

00:47.750 --> 00:50.750
So English mania is a turning point.

00:51.050 --> 00:55.600
Like the harnessing of electricity in our cities or the fall of the Berlin Wall.

00:55.950 --> 00:59.700
English represents hope for a better future.

01:00.150 --> 01:03.750
A future where the world has a common language...

01:04.100 --> 01:06.500
...to solve its common problems.

01:07.000 --> 01:07.700
Thank you very much.
