I once told a Fortune Magazine writer...

00:03.550 --> 00:05.900
...that someday people like me would go to jail.

00:06.850 --> 00:09.100
And that became the headline of a Fortune article.

00:09.150 --> 00:12.650
They went on to describe me as America's greenest CEO.

00:13.250 --> 00:18.100
From plunderer to recovering plunderer, to America's greenest CEO, in five years.

00:18.650 --> 00:24.800
That frankly was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in 1999.

00:25.600 --> 00:31.750
Asked later in the Canadian documentary, The Corporation, what I meant by the "go to jail" remark,...

00:32.100 --> 00:34.700
...I offered that theft is a crime.

00:35.250 --> 00:39.600
And theft of our children's future would someday be a crime.

00:40.450 --> 00:42.250
But I realized for that to be true,...

00:42.300 --> 00:45.350
...for theft of our children's future to be a crime,...

00:45.400 --> 00:48.700
...there must be a clear demonstrable alternative...

00:48.900 --> 00:54.550
...to the take - make - waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization,...

00:54.750 --> 00:58.050
...and is the major culprit, stealing our children's future,...

00:58.150 --> 01:03.250
...by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste...

01:03.450 --> 01:07.050
...in a landfill or an incinerator. In short, digging up the earth...

01:07.350 --> 01:09.200
...and converting it to pollution.
