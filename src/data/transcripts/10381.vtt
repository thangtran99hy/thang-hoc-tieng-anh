00:00.450 --> 00:05.350
And although the circumstances of our lives may seem very distant,...

00:05.400 --> 00:10.100
...with me standing here as the First Lady of the United States of America, and you,...

00:11.100 --> 00:12.750
...just getting through school.

00:13.300 --> 00:16.700
I want you to know that we have very much in common.

00:17.750 --> 00:20.400
For nothing in my life's path...

00:21.300 --> 00:23.700
...would have predicted that I'd be standing here...

00:24.000 --> 00:28.300
...as the first African-American First Lady of the United States of America.

00:28.700 --> 00:32.200
There was nothing in my story that would land me here.

00:33.250 --> 00:36.150
I wasn't raised with wealth or resources,...

00:36.700 --> 00:39.200
...or any social standing to speak of.

00:40.350 --> 00:43.100
I was raised on the south side of Chicago.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.800
That's the real part of Chicago.

00:47.650 --> 00:50.250
And I was the product of a working-class community.

00:50.800 --> 00:54.550
My father was a city worker all of his life,...

00:54.600 --> 00:56.700
...and my mother was a stay-at-home mom,...

00:56.800 --> 01:00.300
...and she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother.
