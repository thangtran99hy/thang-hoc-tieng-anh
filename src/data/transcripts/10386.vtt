I wanna focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on.

00:08.979 --> 00:10.077
What can you do...

00:10.785 --> 00:12.965
...about the climate crisis?

00:14.798 --> 00:15.677
What can you do?

00:18.165 --> 00:19.787
Reduce emissions in your home.

00:20.678 --> 00:24.808
Most of these expenditures are also profitable.

00:25.706 --> 00:30.301
Insulation, better design, buy green electricity where you can.

00:31.071 --> 00:34.736
I mentioned automobiles: buy a hybrid.

00:35.028 --> 00:36.183
Use light rail.

00:37.247 --> 00:39.839
Figure out some of the other options that are much better.

00:39.935 --> 00:40.750
It's important.

00:41.993 --> 00:43.367
Be a green consumer.

00:43.658 --> 00:46.581
You have choices with everything you buy,...

00:46.682 --> 00:50.007
...between things that have a harsh effect...

00:50.239 --> 00:55.855
...or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis.

00:56.498 --> 00:57.625
Consider this.

00:58.355 --> 01:01.711
Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life.

01:02.233 --> 01:04.412
Those of you who are good at branding,...

01:04.831 --> 01:08.744
...I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this...

01:09.162 --> 01:13.137
...in a way that connects with the most people.

01:13.355 --> 01:15.225
It is easier than you think.

01:15.449 --> 01:16.699
It really is.
