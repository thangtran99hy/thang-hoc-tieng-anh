00:00.800 --> 00:03.000
Could you tell me your name please?

00:03.550 --> 00:07.200
Chen Hui. My English name is Charles.

00:08.150 --> 00:13.800
What kind of place do you live in? A house, a flat, or a dormitory?

00:14.200 --> 00:18.100
I live in a flat, on the top floor of a tall building.

00:18.700 --> 00:22.867
It's in the northeast of Beijing, in a residential and commercial area.

00:23.345 --> 00:25.254
It's quite big for just one person.

00:25.950 --> 00:27.700
Do you like living there?

00:28.000 --> 00:30.950
Definitely. As I said, it's quite large.

00:31.250 --> 00:34.700
There are plenty of facilities and green areas in the neighborhood.

00:35.100 --> 00:39.085
For example, there are three parks within walking distance of my home...

00:39.444 --> 00:41.299
...and there's a swimming pool nearby.

00:41.500 --> 00:46.200
It's fairly quiet, though my neighbors can be a little noisy sometimes.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.600
What do you like about the rooms in your home?

00:50.000 --> 00:56.700
My flat has a large living room, a kitchen, a bathroom, a hall, and two bedrooms.

00:57.200 --> 01:02.500
I like the living room and main bedroom because they are spacious and stay bright all day.

01:02.700 --> 01:07.600
The kitchen is not very modern and rather small, but it is good enough for me.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.900
How long have you lived there?

01:10.350 --> 01:15.850
I've lived there for just over a year and I hope I'll be able to stay there for a lot longer.

01:16.350 --> 01:21.000
My landlady is helpful, dealing with any problems quickly and without any fuss.

01:21.400 --> 01:26.100
My friends often tell me horror stories about how their landlords treat them.

01:26.750 --> 01:30.400
What kind of house or apartment would you like to have in the future?

01:31.050 --> 01:35.100
I'd like to have a big house on the outskirts of an historic city.

01:35.500 --> 01:40.500
The house would have three floors and a garden where I could relax in summer.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.850
Ideally, it would have a swimming pool!
