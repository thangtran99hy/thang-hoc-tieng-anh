Guess what? I'm taking a trip to Hawaii with Seiji next month!

00:04.400 --> 00:07.900
Really? That's so cool. I've never been there.

00:08.150 --> 00:09.150
Have you, Mai?

00:09.450 --> 00:13.400
Yeah, I went once with my parents. But I've never been by myself!

00:13.600 --> 00:15.550
I've always wanted to go back.

00:16.250 --> 00:19.300
Mai, did you go to Honolulu when you went with your parents?

00:20.100 --> 00:24.950
No, I went to Maui. I've never been to Honolulu but I've heard it's great.

00:25.650 --> 00:28.100
Kumiko, have you ever been out of the country?

00:28.850 --> 00:31.700
No. But I've traveled a lot within Japan.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.050
Now that's something I haven't done yet!
