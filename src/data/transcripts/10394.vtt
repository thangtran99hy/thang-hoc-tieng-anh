Hello, Mr. Tanaka.

00:01.628 --> 00:03.807
Welcome to Silicon Valley Software.

00:03.983 --> 00:05.791
I'm Jack, VP of Sales.

00:06.205 --> 00:07.641
Very nice to meet you.

00:08.740 --> 00:12.296
I'm Takashi Tanaka, General Manager of Tokyo Technology.

00:12.624 --> 00:14.023
It's nice to meet you as well.

00:14.229 --> 00:15.418
Please call me Taka.

00:16.382 --> 00:18.200
I'm Victoria, VP of Marketing.

00:18.291 --> 00:20.345
It's great to finally meet you face to face.

00:20.695 --> 00:24.732
After speaking so often on the phone, it's nice to "put a face with the voice".

00:25.684 --> 00:28.668
Thank you for coming all the way from Japan to visit our company.

00:28.771 --> 00:30.826
We've been looking forward to meeting you today.

00:31.439 --> 00:32.503
How was the flight?

00:33.450 --> 00:35.257
It was long, but very good.

00:35.544 --> 00:38.466
I just arrived at San Francisco airport 3 hours ago.

00:39.315 --> 00:41.618
Wow, you must be tired from the long flight.

00:42.043 --> 00:43.725
Is the jet lag bothering you?

00:44.809 --> 00:47.479
I'm fine. I was able to get some sleep on the airplane.

00:48.469 --> 00:49.919
Would you like something to drink?

00:50.432 --> 00:53.501
We have coffee, tea, soda and water here.

00:54.421 --> 00:55.015
Oh, thank you.

00:55.173 --> 00:56.276
I could use some coffee. 

00:56.514 --> 00:58.879
The caffeine will help me stay awake during the meeting.

00:59.759 --> 01:02.681
Of course. My assistant will bring it for you right away.
