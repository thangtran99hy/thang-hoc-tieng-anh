00:00.227 --> 00:03.371
Taka, what is your plan for the rest of your stay in the US?

00:04.403 --> 00:07.027
Tomorrow I will visit one customer in San Jose.

00:07.669 --> 00:10.478
After that meeting, I fly to Phoenix for another meeting.

00:11.123 --> 00:13.691
I will fly back to San Francisco on the following day.

00:14.683 --> 00:16.231
When are you going back to Japan?

00:17.210 --> 00:18.859
I will leave the US on Friday.

00:19.862 --> 00:21.830
Wow, you have a pretty tight schedule!

00:22.912 --> 00:25.889
Every time I come to the US, the schedule is always very tight.

00:26.293 --> 00:29.481
Business trips are very tiring, because we schedule so many meetings.

00:29.864 --> 00:33.222
To cut costs, we are reducing the number of business trips company-wide.

00:34.168 --> 00:35.163
It's the same here.

00:35.241 --> 00:37.495
We're doing many more conference calls now.

00:38.396 --> 00:41.329
Recently, we got an advanced video conference system.

00:42.061 --> 00:46.564
It was very expensive, but it could save a lot of money, compared with travel costs.

00:47.613 --> 00:48.742
Less tiring too!
