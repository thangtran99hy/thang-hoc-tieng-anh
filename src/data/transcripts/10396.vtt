00:00.150 --> 00:02.700
OK, then, let's get started.

00:02.950 --> 00:09.250
First, let me review the agenda for today's meeting. It's the one I sent out in my e-mail last week.

00:09.550 --> 00:13.050
The purpose of the meeting is to introduce our companies formally...

00:13.100 --> 00:17.400
...and to explore whether a cooperative marketing and sales effort makes sense.

00:17.700 --> 00:24.500
First, Taka will provide an overview presentation introducing Tokyo Technology. Correct?

00:25.300 --> 00:26.400
Yes, that's right.

00:27.200 --> 00:34.000
After Taka's presentation, Victoria will present a similar summary of Silicon Valley Software.

00:34.400 --> 00:38.500
Then, we will discuss our respective marketing and sales strategies...

00:38.600 --> 00:41.100
...to see how we might work together in the future.

00:41.900 --> 00:45.850
Would it be appropriate for us to compare our client and prospect lists?

00:46.600 --> 00:49.550
Did everyone sign the Non-Disclosure Agreement?

00:50.350 --> 00:54.750
Yes, both companies signed the "NDA" so we should definitely cover that.

00:55.500 --> 00:58.300
Thanks, that is a valuable addition to the agenda.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.350
Finally, we will agree on next steps... specific action items for both companies.

01:05.100 --> 01:06.000
That sounds good.

01:06.750 --> 01:09.500
Excellent. Taka, the floor is yours!
