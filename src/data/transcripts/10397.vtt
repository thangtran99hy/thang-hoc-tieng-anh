So, you won't have any time for yourself, for shopping or anything fun before going back?

00:05.933 --> 00:09.048
I'm planning to meet a good friend for dinner in San Francisco Friday night.

00:09.649 --> 00:12.671
Also, I have to make time to buy some nice California wines.

00:13.369 --> 00:16.057
Every time I come to California, I always buy good wine.

00:16.349 --> 00:17.571
It's much cheaper here.

00:18.493 --> 00:20.206
So, you like good wine, do you?

00:20.565 --> 00:21.746
Have you been to Napa?

00:22.701 --> 00:26.087
Yes, I went there last year and enjoyed tasting tours at a few wineries.

00:26.545 --> 00:27.871
Do you know a lot about wine?

00:28.959 --> 00:31.935
Actually, Victoria knows quite a bit about wine.

00:33.013 --> 00:33.657
That's true.

00:33.993 --> 00:36.548
I love wine more than just about anything else!

00:36.942 --> 00:39.341
One of my friends owns a small winery in Carmel.

00:39.705 --> 00:41.197
I help out there sometimes.

00:41.527 --> 00:44.610
When you come back next, I would like to invite you to a tour there.

00:45.657 --> 00:46.650
Thanks, that sounds great.

00:46.984 --> 00:49.671
I'd better start planning that next business trip after all.
