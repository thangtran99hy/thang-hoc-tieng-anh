I'm pleased to introduce my company, Tokyo Technology.

00:03.850 --> 00:08.500
Let me start off by giving a brief corporate overview, followed by a more thorough product review.

00:09.250 --> 00:15.900
Our company was established in May of 1999. We just celebrated our 10th anniversary last month.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.350
Our headquarters are located at Shibuya in Tokyo.

00:20.100 --> 00:22.350
We also have a branch office in Osaka.

00:23.100 --> 00:26.100
Our founder and CEO is Norio Matsuda.

00:26.950 --> 00:29.700
He has more than 20 years of experience in this industry.

00:30.500 --> 00:34.900
The total number of employees as of last month was 358.

00:35.800 --> 00:39.600
As you can see from this chart, our revenues continue to grow.

00:40.350 --> 00:45.400
We have grown our top line at a rate of 12% per year, since we started the business 10 years ago.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.350
We are very proud of this achievement.

00:49.200 --> 00:56.050
Sales in 2008 were 122 million dollars, slightly above our target of 120 million dollars.

00:56.900 --> 01:01.100
Due to the current economic situation, this year will be very tough.

01:01.850 --> 01:05.650
Even so, the first quarter of this year was not as bad as expected.

01:05.800 --> 01:10.700
Sales were 27 million dollars, down 8 percent from first quarter 2008.
