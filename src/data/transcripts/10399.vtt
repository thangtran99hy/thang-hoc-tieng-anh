00:00.100 --> 00:03.700
Taka, it certainly seems that we have a good working relationship.

00:04.500 --> 00:05.700
I feel the same.

00:06.500 --> 00:10.400
We understand now that the goals of both companies seem to be aligned,...

00:10.500 --> 00:13.500
...and that our products could work in a complementary way.

00:13.800 --> 00:17.500
This could create a very valuable solution for our customers.

00:17.750 --> 00:22.200
I think we should move forward with a partnership in which we develop business together.

00:23.050 --> 00:25.400
I am pleased to hear this. I agree completely!

00:25.650 --> 00:30.400
Of course, we need to have more detailed discussions on the products from the engineering perspective.

00:31.317 --> 00:33.113
Yes, in terms of technical issues,...

00:33.204 --> 00:36.034
...we need to involve engineering teams from both companies.

00:36.800 --> 00:40.500
Why don't we plan another meeting to focus on technical integration issues?

00:41.300 --> 00:43.000
That's exactly what I was thinking.

00:43.350 --> 00:46.400
We need to have that engineering meeting as soon as possible.

00:47.200 --> 00:51.500
How about scheduling a conference call next week after you get back to Japan, Taka?

00:52.322 --> 00:54.945
Ok. I'll talk with the engineering department right away,...

00:55.037 --> 00:57.401
...and suggest a few possible dates and times.

00:58.300 --> 01:02.800
Sounds good. I'll coordinate a meeting with the engineering team on my side.
