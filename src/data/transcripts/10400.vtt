00:00.232 --> 00:02.907
Let's get started on a business collaboration agreement.

00:04.059 --> 00:06.186
Would you mind taking a shot at the first draft?

00:07.269 --> 00:08.251
No problem.

00:08.406 --> 00:10.299
I'll have the legal department work on it.

00:10.918 --> 00:13.482
We have a standard template for a business alliance,...

00:13.702 --> 00:16.750
...so I think I can send the first draft by the end of next week.

00:17.989 --> 00:18.460
Sounds good.

00:18.544 --> 00:21.048
As soon as I receive it, I'll have my team review it.

00:21.993 --> 00:23.798
Good. Thank you, Taka.

00:24.457 --> 00:26.567
Well, I think it's about time to wrap it up.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.314
Victoria, do you have anything to add?

00:30.549 --> 00:32.635
No, I think we've covered everything.

00:33.828 --> 00:39.934
Ok then, our action items today are to set up a conference call with the engineering teams next week.

00:40.525 --> 00:44.885
And I will send you an initial draft of the partnership agreement by the end of next week.

00:45.992 --> 00:47.127
Sounds right to me.

00:47.987 --> 00:50.919
Thank you all for a very productive meeting today.

00:51.432 --> 00:53.953
I hope it's the first of many more to come!
