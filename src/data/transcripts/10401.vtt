00:00.290 --> 00:03.869
Before I move on to the next slide, does anyone have any questions so far?

00:04.976 --> 00:05.926
Yes, I do.

00:06.281 --> 00:08.970
You said the company faces many challenges now.

00:09.463 --> 00:13.754
Beyond the economic situation, what is your biggest single challenge?

00:14.960 --> 00:17.236
Well, that's a good question and I was planning to talk about it.

00:18.011 --> 00:21.323
As I showed you, our revenues grew for 10 consecutive years.

00:21.591 --> 00:23.924
But now, the market is highly saturated.

00:24.713 --> 00:26.757
Unless we open new geographic markets,...

00:27.092 --> 00:31.259
...or develop a new product for the existing markets, our growth period is over.

00:32.065 --> 00:36.290
Actually, that is why I am here with you, to explore new market opportunities.

00:37.105 --> 00:39.831
Our company was a pioneer in this market 10 years ago,...

00:40.407 --> 00:43.081
...but since then, many competitors have entered this market.

00:43.976 --> 00:47.526
It is critical not only to develop leading-edge products that differentiate us,...

00:47.832 --> 00:50.522
...but to look for partnerships, which we will discuss later.

00:51.570 --> 00:56.564
The other big issue is finding the right people... particularly young, innovative engineers.

00:57.377 --> 00:59.892
It is getting harder to attract enough good engineers.

01:00.637 --> 01:03.145
We still have open positions in our Engineering Department...

01:03.330 --> 01:06.903
... that we haven't been able to fill for three months, even in this job market.

01:07.712 --> 01:10.975
I can relate to that issue. We have a similar problem here, too...

01:11.937 --> 01:15.784
...although it's a "moot point" because we can't afford to hire new people at the moment anyway.
