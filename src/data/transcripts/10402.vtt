Let's start out with a brief look at the environment facing us in this market.

00:04.800 --> 00:09.700
This chart indicates the sales trend we've experienced over the past three years...

00:10.300 --> 00:13.800
...and where we expect to go over the next three years.

00:14.400 --> 00:18.600
As you see here, the overall market size has been expanding quickly.

00:19.200 --> 00:23.300
Analysts predict it could double again by 2012.

00:23.950 --> 00:30.200
The key to success here is to have a series of products that meet the market needs earlier than competitors.

00:30.900 --> 00:36.000
But which products? We need to understand our customers' requirements fully.

00:36.650 --> 00:43.100
So, last month I organized a three-person marketing team to determine key customer requirements.

00:43.750 --> 00:46.600
The time frame for this project is three months.

00:47.300 --> 00:51.800
We will have our final report in September; I would be pleased to share it with you.

00:52.550 --> 00:55.800
That's great. It should be very valuable information for us.

00:55.900 --> 00:57.800
Is that only for the U.S. market?

00:58.750 --> 01:02.600
No, we have been researching global markets, including Japan.

01:03.350 --> 01:07.300
Other markets include Germany, the UK, France, and China.

01:07.850 --> 01:12.400
Regarding the Japanese market, we would appreciate any input you could provide, Taka.

01:13.100 --> 01:14.800
My team would be glad to help.
