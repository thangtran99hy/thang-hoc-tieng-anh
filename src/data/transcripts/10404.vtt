00:00.675 --> 00:02.549
How many languages do you speak?

00:03.659 --> 00:07.614
I speak six languages, if you include my native language,...

00:08.009 --> 00:11.167
...but I only speak two foreign languages well.

00:12.188 --> 00:16.445
I speak the other three languages well enough to survive,...

00:17.301 --> 00:20.165
...but not enough for a long conversation.

00:21.256 --> 00:24.071
I would like to improve my ability to speak them.

00:25.353 --> 00:29.981
Perhaps in the future I'll get a job in countries where those languages are spoken.

00:31.303 --> 00:33.433
How long have you been studying English?

00:34.669 --> 00:37.457
I've been studying English for over ten years.

00:38.107 --> 00:40.771
Some of that has been with teachers in the classroom...

00:41.700 --> 00:45.720
...but I have learned a lot of idioms by listening to other people speak.

00:46.757 --> 00:50.672
Is there anything you find especially difficult about learning English?

00:51.776 --> 00:55.245
I find grammar quite challenging in any language.

00:55.829 --> 01:00.860
Apart from that, it isn't that much different from other languages.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.732
How important is English to you?

01:04.903 --> 01:10.987
It's vital for me to know English because I use it at work every day.

01:11.616 --> 01:14.931
I travel to English speaking countries a lot.

01:16.011 --> 01:18.491
I also have a lot of friends from various countries...

01:18.873 --> 01:21.209
...and we use English as a common language.

01:22.063 --> 01:25.189
English is also really helpful for searching on the Internet.
