00:22.750 --> 00:24.050
You brought this here for me?

00:24.300 --> 00:25.800
Credo requested.

00:25.950 --> 00:27.750
She yearns for your touch.

00:28.850 --> 00:33.150
Thanks. This blade's the best battle companion a swordsman could wish for.

01:00.900 --> 01:02.500
Fortuna Castle, huh?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.600
That's what the witnesses said.

01:04.650 --> 01:08.400
The guy just came from Hell. He's gotta hit up a couple of tourist sites.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.700
You jest so lightly in a time of crisis?

01:18.500 --> 01:20.300
You must capture him.

01:21.250 --> 01:23.400
Trust me, I'll get it done.

01:23.550 --> 01:24.800
Please be careful.

01:25.100 --> 01:26.800
You still haven't recovered.

01:27.300 --> 01:29.600
There's no time and duty calls.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.550
Can't pass on an emergency.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.700
I must return to headquarters and report.
