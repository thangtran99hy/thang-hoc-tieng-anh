00:15.050 --> 00:16.300
I should've seen it coming.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.550
It didn't take long after the fall of the Umbrella Corporation,...

00:19.900 --> 00:22.850
...for their bioweapons to end up in the hands of terrorists.

00:23.650 --> 00:27.500
A new era of bioterrorism descended upon vulnerable countries,...

00:27.800 --> 00:30.400
...shifting the balance of power throughout the region.

00:32.700 --> 00:38.600
People in the destabilized areas soon feared another incident like Raccoon City was inevitable.

00:39.250 --> 00:44.400
As panic spread, governments of the world turned to the Global Pharmaceutical Consortium,...

00:44.900 --> 00:47.800
...which formed the anti-terrorism unit BSAA.

00:48.650 --> 00:54.000
Operatives of the BSAA were sent to infiltrate and neutralize bioterrorist hotspots,...

00:54.300 --> 00:58.100
...restoring safety and stability to various regions around the globe.

01:04.350 --> 01:05.600
Welcome to Africa.

01:07.750 --> 01:09.200
My name is Sheva Alomar.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.700
Chris Redfield.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.350
Your reputation precedes you, Mr. Redfield. It's an honor.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.500
Just Chris, thanks.

01:17.100 --> 01:19.200
So you'll be accompanying me to the destination?

01:19.250 --> 01:22.900
Yes. Tensions are running high ever since the change in government.

01:23.150 --> 01:26.400
I'll bet. Intel says it's a haven for terrorists now.

01:26.700 --> 01:30.700
And they're not going to be happy to see an American. BSAA or not.

01:30.950 --> 01:33.700
That's why I'm your partner; help put them at ease.

01:34.350 --> 01:38.900
I'm sure you'll do just fine. Partner.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.200
You OK?

01:48.300 --> 01:51.200
Yeah, sorry... it's nothing. Let's go.

01:56.750 --> 02:00.200
Casualties continue to mount over the long years I've struggled.

02:02.200 --> 02:06.750
More and more I find myself wondering if it's all worth fighting for.

02:07.850 --> 02:10.100
Maybe one day I'll find out.

02:17.150 --> 02:18.800
You don't have to get touchy.

02:21.750 --> 02:22.250
Let's go.

02:26.050 --> 02:27.900
There is one thing I do know.

02:29.050 --> 02:31.900
I have a job to do and I'm gonna see it through.
