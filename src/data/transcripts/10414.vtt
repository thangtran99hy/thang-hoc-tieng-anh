00:00.730 --> 00:01.735
Home.

00:02.500 --> 00:05.600
Ours was once a planet called Cybertron,...

00:06.200 --> 00:11.000
...until war brought its destruction and made exiles of us all.

00:11.845 --> 00:15.240
The lone hope for our race lay with the "All Spark",...

00:15.380 --> 00:17.250
...the keeper of our history.

00:17.680 --> 00:21.920
But with its destruction, only fragments now remain.

00:22.300 --> 00:24.300
Hidden away for all time.

00:25.590 --> 00:29.400
And though we have vanquished the Decepticon leader, Megatron,...

00:30.060 --> 00:31.960
...his minions remain.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.260
Waging secret war against us.

00:47.655 --> 00:52.515
Now, we, Autobots and our allies defend the human race...

00:53.850 --> 00:56.180
...from an evil it knows not.

00:57.520 --> 01:00.025
This stalemate cannot last.

01:00.490 --> 01:02.915
One side must win.

01:03.700 --> 01:06.530
And yet, the battle continues.
