Must be quite a life you have in that school-- champagne for lunch.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.400
Only on special occasions.

00:06.500 --> 00:07.100
For instance?

00:07.750 --> 00:09.800
The last time was my father's anniversary.

00:10.100 --> 00:10.600
Wedding?

00:11.450 --> 00:16.850
No, it was the fortieth anniversary of the day he got his job.

00:17.280 --> 00:20.420
Forty years on the job. What do you know about that!

00:21.620 --> 00:22.585
What does he do?

00:24.190 --> 00:27.600
Well, mostly you might call it public relations.

00:27.990 --> 00:30.160
Oh well! That's hard work.

00:30.230 --> 00:31.310
Yes, I wouldn't care for it.

00:31.470 --> 00:31.930
Does he?

00:32.800 --> 00:34.830
I've heard him complain about it.

00:35.135 --> 00:36.050
Why doesn't he quit?

00:37.000 --> 00:40.500
Well, people in that line of work almost never do quit.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.970
Unless, it's actually unhealthy for them to continue.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.980
Well, here's to his health then.

00:47.715 --> 00:51.150
You know, that's what everybody says.
