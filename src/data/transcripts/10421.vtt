00:07.000 --> 00:08.700
For years they've waited,...

00:10.330 --> 00:12.110
...engineering an army...

00:15.900 --> 00:17.450
...and waiting for the day...

00:17.550 --> 00:20.550
MARS supplied some of our best weapons in the past.

00:20.800 --> 00:24.090
We can't let all that tech get into the hands of the bad guys.

00:24.250 --> 00:25.950
...to launch their attack.

00:28.850 --> 00:30.680
The missiles are being prepped for launch.

00:36.350 --> 00:37.570
Hail Cobra!

00:39.810 --> 00:42.175
But as the forces of Cobra strike,...

00:43.800 --> 00:45.740
...our last hope lies...

00:46.900 --> 00:48.415
...with one team.

00:48.520 --> 00:50.050
Heads up, Duke. We've got company.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.515
Nice. Bring 'em on!

00:58.030 --> 00:59.655
Well, look at you,...

01:00.190 --> 01:01.360
...still alive.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.930
Let's see what we can do about that.

01:14.870 --> 01:17.975
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. The game.
