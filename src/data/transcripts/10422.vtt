00:06.960 --> 00:08.330
Don't you just love it?

00:08.820 --> 00:09.560
Love what?

00:10.175 --> 00:11.160
Tiffany's.

00:21.850 --> 00:23.155
Isn't it wonderful?

00:23.850 --> 00:27.050
Do you see what I mean, how nothing bad could ever happen to you in a place like this?

00:27.220 --> 00:30.255
It isn't that I give a hoot about jewelry, except diamonds, of course.

00:32.065 --> 00:33.355
Like that.

00:39.965 --> 00:41.185
What do you think?

00:42.165 --> 00:43.215
Well...

00:45.715 --> 00:48.915
Of course, personally, I think it would be tacky to wear diamonds before I'm forty.

00:49.600 --> 00:50.580
Well, you're right.

00:51.475 --> 00:53.145
But in the meantime, you should have something.

00:53.250 --> 00:54.040
I'll wait.

00:54.915 --> 00:56.415
No, I'm gonna buy you a present.

00:57.415 --> 00:59.615
You bought me one, a typewriter ribbon, and it brought me luck.

01:00.010 --> 01:02.045
Alright, but Tiffany's can be pretty expensive.

01:02.205 --> 01:04.610
I've got my check and 10 dollars.

01:04.775 --> 01:06.445
Oh! I wouldn't let you cash your check.

01:07.510 --> 01:09.310
But a present for 10 dollars or under,...

01:09.530 --> 01:10.475
...that I'll accept.

01:11.380 --> 01:14.040
Of course, I don't exactly know what we're gonna find at Tiffany's for 10 dollars.
