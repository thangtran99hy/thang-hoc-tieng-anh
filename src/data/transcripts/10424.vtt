00:02.200 --> 00:03.200
What are you doing?

00:03.600 --> 00:05.400
Taking off my shoes. What do you think I'm doing?

00:05.450 --> 00:07.800
Did you ever hear of anyone taking a shower with their shoes on?

00:11.000 --> 00:13.900
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I'm in the shower.

00:14.150 --> 00:15.650
Oh! Any requests?

00:16.050 --> 00:17.100
Shut the door!

00:17.600 --> 00:20.000
Oh, I'm afraid I don't know that one miss. Well.

00:21.700 --> 00:22.900
Shut the door!

00:23.100 --> 00:24.600
Why? Come in and watch.

00:37.450 --> 00:38.600
Drip-dry!

00:41.250 --> 00:43.400
How often do you go through this little ritual?

00:43.500 --> 00:46.200
Oh! Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.

00:46.400 --> 00:48.000
I don't believe it.

00:48.050 --> 00:49.700
Oh, yes it... Wait a minute.

00:53.300 --> 00:55.300
Read the label. Look, look at the small print.

00:57.400 --> 01:01.000
"Wearing this suit during washing helps protect its shape."

01:08.800 --> 01:09.600
Waterproof.

01:18.100 --> 01:24.200
Acronylon. Fibrous resistant. Plastic. Rustproof. Fly-proof. Proo-proof!

01:24.900 --> 01:26.100
You're the nut.
