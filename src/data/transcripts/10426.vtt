00:13.000 --> 00:13.980
Taxi, miss?

00:14.180 --> 00:15.645
Cheapest rates in Glen Cove.

00:16.215 --> 00:18.150
Well, hello! How are you?

00:18.685 --> 00:20.320
Well, I'm fine. How are you?

00:20.550 --> 00:22.155
And I might add, who are you?

00:23.155 --> 00:24.190
Who am I?

00:24.690 --> 00:25.825
Am I supposed to know?

00:27.490 --> 00:29.280
Come to think of it, no, you're not supposed to know.

00:29.395 --> 00:30.465
Are you stranded?

00:31.050 --> 00:33.700
My father was supposed to pick me up but something must've happened.

00:33.830 --> 00:36.800
Whoever your father is and whatever happened, I'll be eternally grateful.

00:36.935 --> 00:38.070
That is if I can give you a lift.

00:38.500 --> 00:40.475
You certainly can. You can drive me home.

00:40.670 --> 00:42.000
Good! I'll get your bags.

00:44.555 --> 00:45.275
Where do you live?

00:46.270 --> 00:47.245
Dosoris Lane.

00:47.845 --> 00:48.715
Dosoris Lane?

00:49.280 --> 00:51.050
Say, that's where I live.

00:51.150 --> 00:51.785
Really?

00:51.980 --> 00:53.655
Sure. We must be neighbors.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.385
And if there's one thing I believe in, it's "love thy neighbor".

00:56.655 --> 00:58.355
Oh! So do I.

00:59.400 --> 01:00.275
Come on, David.

01:01.210 --> 01:03.565
David? Is his name David?

01:03.695 --> 01:04.465
Yes, it is.

01:05.095 --> 01:05.765
That's funny.

01:05.865 --> 01:07.035
My name's David too.

01:08.465 --> 01:09.735
That is funny, isn't it?
