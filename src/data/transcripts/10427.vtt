Hello friends. This is Emily, joining you from my New York state bedroom.

00:04.550 --> 00:06.500
As you can tell, I'm wearing sunglasses.

00:06.650 --> 00:10.300
This is all because of a new fashion trend that I've recently started called,...

00:10.550 --> 00:12.500
..."Wear your sunglasses at all times,...

00:12.900 --> 00:15.900
...look cool and feel great." Heck, yeah!

00:16.400 --> 00:18.750
In any case, I've been up to so much since I've been in New York.

00:18.850 --> 00:24.000
I've been just, just doing activities that I would have never dreamt of doing anywhere else in the world.

00:24.350 --> 00:27.200
Because when you're in Western New York, everything is possible.

00:28.150 --> 00:30.600
And I've been doing everything, ever.

00:31.260 --> 00:33.996
So, I decided to compile some clips today.

00:34.074 --> 00:37.551
You know, compile some clips to show you guys what I've been up to...

00:37.550 --> 00:39.200
...because I know you've been missing me.

00:39.420 --> 00:42.431
I mean, I've gotten just thousands of e-mails in the past minute...

00:42.539 --> 00:44.647
...of people just begging me to make a new video clip.

00:45.300 --> 00:47.200
And what can I say, I like to give.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.233
Not take, but give.

00:49.337 --> 00:55.763
So I'm gonna give to you by just compiling clips as I said previously and just showing them.

00:56.500 --> 00:59.336
So, I hope you can enjoy watching me in what I've been doing.

00:59.469 --> 01:01.586
I'm gonna narrate these clips I suppose.

01:01.600 --> 01:02.900
I'm all about narration.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.500
So, anyway, I hope you enjoy and keep it real.

01:12.340 --> 01:13.900
Wow! Pool rocks.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.400
Yes!

01:25.400 --> 01:26.800
It's broken!

01:32.100 --> 01:33.400
It works!

01:44.200 --> 01:49.500
I can't play the guitar at all.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.500
And it's so sad!

02:01.200 --> 02:03.000
I'm so sweet at playing the drums.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.700
Yes!

02:18.247 --> 02:20.068
So, I hope you've enjoyed watching these clips...

02:20.166 --> 02:23.068
...as much as I've enjoyed compiling them and showing them to you.

02:23.100 --> 02:25.600
Remember, the word of the day is 'Compile'.

02:26.100 --> 02:28.600
And until we meet again, you know, keep it real,...

02:28.900 --> 02:31.700
...keep it intense, and you know, keep it damn stylish.
