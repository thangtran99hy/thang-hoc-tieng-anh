Hello YouTube. This is Emily.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.600
And today, I'm joining you from a different angle than the angle that I usually sit at.

00:08.850 --> 00:12.000
This is mostly due to the fact that my room has very poor lighting.

00:15.500 --> 00:17.250
I apologize for the poor lighting.

00:17.400 --> 00:21.100
I also realized that my face looks very red because I've been out in the sun today.

00:21.550 --> 00:23.500
That means that I actually go out in the sun.

00:23.650 --> 00:25.500
Sometimes, I try not to.

00:25.700 --> 00:28.700
It's good to maintain this very white complexion, you know.

00:29.000 --> 00:29.950
I gotta keep it real.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.200
I gotta represent.

00:31.850 --> 00:34.250
Anyway, today I just wanna rant about things.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.100
Lately I've been all into the video editing.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.250
I've been editing everything.

00:37.300 --> 00:39.400
I've been like, Oh my God! Edit, edit, edit, edit, edit, edit.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.000
And I've just been editing like crazy.

00:41.050 --> 00:42.250
I'm like an editing machine.

00:42.300 --> 00:45.800
I've got it down; pack, snap, cut, deliver.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.850
But, you know, today I decided to go back to my normal route of just talking to you.

00:50.900 --> 00:53.500
Let's see, does my light look a little bit better if I'm very close to the camera?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.150
Just talking to you.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.550
Just telling you about things.

00:57.600 --> 00:58.600
Things that are on my mind.

00:58.650 --> 00:59.700
And things that are bothering me.

00:59.750 --> 01:01.200
And things that aren't bothering me.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.200
And there's one thing lately.

01:04.900 --> 01:09.000
That I don't know if I would say that it's bothering me or the fact that it's just disturbing me.

01:09.050 --> 01:13.600
But, so many people have been talking about this thing called, "Second Life."

01:15.100 --> 01:17.100
It's the word "second" and "life."

01:17.750 --> 01:21.100
I've been getting all these sorts of invites and people telling me,...

01:21.200 --> 01:25.350
"Oh my God, Emily this game is so super special, awesome. It's amazing you should totally play it."

01:25.950 --> 01:27.850
So, you know, I'd like to give the thing a try.

01:27.900 --> 01:31.900
So, being me, I downloaded the thing and gave it a go.

01:33.600 --> 01:38.250
I don't know if I'm not getting it, but I'm not getting it.

01:38.450 --> 01:44.500
You know, I go on the game and you walk around and you can be some sort of person that you're not.
