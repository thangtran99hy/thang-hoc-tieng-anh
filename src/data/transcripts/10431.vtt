00:01.515 --> 00:03.370
Are you sure you don't wanna tell me your name?

00:03.870 --> 00:04.535
Positive.

00:05.425 --> 00:07.040
I'm having much too much fun.

00:07.645 --> 00:09.105
Alright, if you wanna play games.

00:09.655 --> 00:11.710
Have you always lived here in Long Island?

00:12.010 --> 00:12.980
Most of my life.

00:13.545 --> 00:15.915
I could have sworn I knew every pretty girl on the North Shore.

00:16.225 --> 00:18.685
I could have sworn you took in more territory than that.

00:20.005 --> 00:20.885
This is maddening!

00:21.085 --> 00:22.820
I know I've seen that face before.

00:22.985 --> 00:24.355
Let me see your profile again.

00:26.300 --> 00:27.395
I know I know you.

00:28.025 --> 00:31.295
I have a feeling I've seen you... with your father.

00:32.230 --> 00:34.065
Wait a minute! Is your father Admiral Starratt?

00:34.600 --> 00:35.400
Hardly.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.410
It's funny, I keep seeing him in a uniform.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.275
Oh, come on! Give me a hint.

00:41.600 --> 00:42.510
What does your father do?

00:43.150 --> 00:44.375
He's in transportation.

00:45.000 --> 00:45.845
Transportation?

00:46.645 --> 00:47.915
Railroads. New York Central?

00:48.130 --> 00:48.615
No.

00:48.880 --> 00:49.750
Planes. TWA?

00:49.980 --> 00:50.515
No.

00:50.820 --> 00:52.085
Boats. United States Lines?

00:52.575 --> 00:53.220
No.

00:54.155 --> 00:54.885
I pass.

00:55.355 --> 00:56.255
Automobiles.

00:57.190 --> 00:59.355
Oh? Chrysler?

01:00.125 --> 01:04.530
Yes. Chrysler and Ford, and General Motors, and Rolls-Royce.

01:05.095 --> 01:07.265
Is your father on the board of directors of all those companies?

01:08.130 --> 01:09.870
Well, you might say he runs things.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.975
I bet my brother Linus knows him.

01:13.570 --> 01:14.775
He certainly does.

01:15.140 --> 01:17.475
As a matter of fact, they quite often drive into town together.

01:18.075 --> 01:18.645
They do?

01:19.570 --> 01:21.480
Straight through to the garage please.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.380
I feel so stupid, I could kill myself.

01:25.050 --> 01:26.555
You'll be alright in a minute.
