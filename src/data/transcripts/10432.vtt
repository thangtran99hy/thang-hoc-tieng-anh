00:01.933 --> 00:04.783
You are, of course, wondering why I brought you here tonight.

00:04.927 --> 00:07.403
Actually, sir, after all these years I just sort of go with it.

00:07.867 --> 00:08.623
Take my arm.

00:11.730 --> 00:14.030
People sometimes think; "Oh! Is it boring to play the same character for so long?"

00:14.167 --> 00:18.383
No, it's not. Because he changes so much that actually, no. It doesn't get boring in the slightest.

00:18.477 --> 00:24.117
It's like a marathon, making these movies. They take 6 months to shoot. It's quite a big job.

00:24.567 --> 00:26.213
But I enjoy it. It's really fun.

00:26.597 --> 00:28.450
The energy of the young cast is tremendous.

00:28.520 --> 00:29.557
That really lifts you up.

00:29.647 --> 00:32.757
It's so exciting to know that there is a big audience waiting to see what you've done.

00:32.867 --> 00:35.717
Probably the funniest Harry Potter film and the scariest.

00:36.767 --> 00:38.517
This place has known magic.

00:40.933 --> 00:41.617
Very dark.

00:45.920 --> 00:46.923
Very powerful.

00:52.387 --> 00:55.177
This time, I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

00:55.233 --> 00:59.659
He takes Harry on a long journey... through seas and mountains,...

00:59.787 --> 01:02.697
...and the wind blowing,... and there are these creatures...

01:02.753 --> 01:06.603
And Harry has to take over and solve all these problems.

01:06.747 --> 01:12.630
It's the sort of rise of Harry's maturity and the demise of Dumbledore.

01:12.733 --> 01:14.117
...enjoying your classes, Harry?

01:15.153 --> 01:17.510
What about your activities outside the classroom?

01:18.567 --> 01:19.717
I can't help wondering if...

01:19.933 --> 01:22.950
Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant but we're friends.

01:23.633 --> 01:24.250
Ok, sorry.

01:24.367 --> 01:27.897
We've all been through that, you know. And it's really a traumatic age, frankly.

01:28.187 --> 01:32.890
Because you gotta deal with your hormones. You gotta deal with the politics of boyfriends and girlfriends.

01:33.013 --> 01:35.730
It was bloody awkward. I don't know what to tell you.

01:35.827 --> 01:37.363
It was very, very strange.

01:38.213 --> 01:43.070
You know, he's practically like my big brother and, you know, I've grown up with him.

01:43.180 --> 01:46.527
So, you know, I had to be very professional...

01:46.625 --> 01:50.810
...and really try and get myself into character to be able to deal with it.

01:50.870 --> 01:54.163
It's a lot to kinda get into. I mean, after the first few takes... it's fine.

01:55.047 --> 01:59.563
I've seen so many, sort of massive... scenes with hundreds of people in the great hall...

01:59.655 --> 02:04.450
...and then suddenly, to have just the two of us in a scene is such a kind of big contrast.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.357
Take my hand.

02:12.660 --> 02:14.703
These girls, they're gonna kill me, Harry.

02:14.967 --> 02:15.870
It's over.

02:20.433 --> 02:22.077
From Warner Brothers Pictures.

02:22.140 --> 02:22.727
Ginny!

02:26.727 --> 02:27.650
I have to do this.

02:28.593 --> 02:31.457
Fight back, you coward! Fight back!
