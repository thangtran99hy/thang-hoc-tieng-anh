Hi, I'm Chris Brown.

00:02.450 --> 00:05.450
Since February, my attorney has advised me not to speak out,...

00:05.618 --> 00:07.042
...even though ever since the incident,...

00:07.115 --> 00:10.976
...I wanted to publicly express my deepest regret and accept full responsibility.

00:11.650 --> 00:14.700
Although, I will do some interviews and answer some questions in the future,...

00:15.000 --> 00:17.950
...I felt it was time that you heard directly from me that I am sorry.

00:18.800 --> 00:22.350
I have tried to live my life in a way which can make those around me proud of me...

00:22.650 --> 00:25.600
...and until recently, I think I was doing a pretty good job.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.100
I wish I had the chance to live those few moments again.

00:29.500 --> 00:30.900
But unfortunately, I can't.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.329
I cannot go into what happened and most importantly,...

00:33.404 --> 00:35.271
... I'm not gonna sit here and make any excuses.

00:36.050 --> 00:40.600
I take great pride in me being able to exercise self-control and what I did was inexcusable.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.000
I am very sad and very ashamed of what I've done.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.900
My mother and my spiritual teachers have taught me way better than that.

00:48.750 --> 00:51.600
I have told Rihanna countless times and I'm telling you today;...

00:51.820 --> 00:53.305
...that I am truly, truly sorry...

00:53.722 --> 00:56.585
...and that I wasn't able to handle the situation both differently and better.

00:57.700 --> 00:59.500
I recognize that I've truly been blessed.

00:59.550 --> 01:03.200
I've been blessed with a wonderful family, wonderful friends and fans.

01:03.950 --> 01:07.700
God has been generous in giving me the ability which has brought me fame and fortune.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.800
I've done a lot of soul searching over the past several months.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
I've talked with my minister and my mother...

01:13.350 --> 01:16.100
...and I've spent a lot of time trying to understand what happened and why.

01:17.350 --> 01:18.850
I've let a lot of people down...

01:18.950 --> 01:22.000
...and I realize that. And no one is more disappointed in me than I am.

01:22.950 --> 01:26.400
As many of you know, I grew up in a home where there was domestic violence.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.350
And I saw firsthand what uncontrolled rage can do.

01:30.600 --> 01:36.000
I have sought and I'm continuing to seek help to ensure that what occurred in February can never happen again.

01:36.413 --> 01:39.559
And as I sit here today, I can tell you that I will do everything in my power...

01:39.625 --> 01:41.074
...to make sure that it never happens again.

01:41.300 --> 01:42.300
And I promise that.
