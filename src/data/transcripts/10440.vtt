00:00.800 --> 00:02.300
Here comes Ichiro.

00:02.700 --> 00:07.300
And Rick, they've got the "Ichiro Shift" on with all the infielders between first and second base.

00:07.750 --> 00:11.000
Now, they're bringing the outfielders in to play between second and third.

00:11.100 --> 00:14.900
And look at this, here comes the whole bullpen to play the outfield.

00:15.150 --> 00:15.750
No problem.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.300
Teams will try anything to stop this guy.

00:18.650 --> 00:22.700
Ichiro lines one into the corner and no one's gonna get to it!

00:23.000 --> 00:24.300
My, oh my!

00:24.350 --> 00:26.500
You gotta hit 'em where they ain't.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.550
Mariners Baseball. Viva la Mojo.
