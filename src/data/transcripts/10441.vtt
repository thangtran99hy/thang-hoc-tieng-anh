Ichiro, congratulations first of all.

00:03.150 --> 00:07.650
Is there one incident or one person that counseled you,...

00:07.700 --> 00:14.200
...that made the difference in you re-signing here as opposed to putting yourself out there on the free agent market?

00:31.400 --> 00:32.450
Ikkyu, my dog.

00:34.750 --> 00:35.700
Did it talk to you?

00:38.150 --> 00:38.700
Of course.

00:38.900 --> 00:39.650
What did he say?

00:43.250 --> 00:44.450
He said Roof! Roof! Roof!

00:45.700 --> 00:47.300
If you translate it, that means?

00:47.400 --> 00:48.900
That means stay, stay, stay.
