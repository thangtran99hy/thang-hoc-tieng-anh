00:06.251 --> 00:07.481
It has been said...

00:16.513 --> 00:18.763
...that in the end of all things,...

00:27.921 --> 00:29.992
...we would find a new beginning.

00:39.499 --> 00:43.137
But as the shadow once again crawls across our world...

00:52.941 --> 00:56.817
...and the stench of terror drifts on a bitter wind,...

01:03.270 --> 01:06.471
...the people pray for strength and guidance.

01:10.049 --> 01:12.791
They should pray for the mercy of a swift death.

01:15.913 --> 01:18.381
For I have seen what the darkness hides.

01:43.308 --> 01:45.261
I don't think it's safe here.
