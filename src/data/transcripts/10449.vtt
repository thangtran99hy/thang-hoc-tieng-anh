00:35.481 --> 00:36.365
You are beaten.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.653
It is useless to resist.

00:39.216 --> 00:42.011
Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.

00:58.317 --> 00:59.544
There is no escape.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.391
Don't make me destroy you.

01:05.129 --> 01:08.851
Luke, you do not yet realize your importance.

01:09.585 --> 01:12.089
You have only begun to discover your power.

01:12.747 --> 01:16.301
Join me and I will complete your training.

01:16.950 --> 01:24.619
With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.

01:25.017 --> 01:26.427
I'll never join you!

01:27.075 --> 01:30.753
If you only knew the power of the dark side.

01:31.707 --> 01:35.579
Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.

01:36.209 --> 01:37.229
He told me enough!

01:40.475 --> 01:41.686
He told me you killed him.

01:42.033 --> 01:45.484
No, I am your father.

01:50.365 --> 01:55.478
No, no, it's not true!

01:57.421 --> 01:58.787
That's impossible!

01:59.033 --> 02:00.328
Search your feelings.

02:00.449 --> 02:02.160
You know it to be true.

02:03.863 --> 02:07.975
No! No!

02:09.869 --> 02:13.037
Luke, you can destroy the emperor.

02:13.505 --> 02:15.127
He has foreseen this.

02:15.538 --> 02:17.725
It is your destiny.

02:18.440 --> 02:24.026
Join me, and together, we can rule the galaxy as father and son.

02:35.539 --> 02:38.900
Come with me. It is the only way.
