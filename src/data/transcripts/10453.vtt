Generally speaking, if you find yourself in the water with sharks,...

00:03.900 --> 00:07.000
...what you should do is sit back, relax, and enjoy the experience.

00:07.100 --> 00:09.000
But sometimes, sharks can get aggressive.

00:09.250 --> 00:14.100
A number of shark species will actually arch their back and drop their pectoral fins in a threat display.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.600
To dodge a charging shark, you kinda have to act like a matador,...

00:17.700 --> 00:20.200
...put your hands on top of its head and push it on by.

00:20.400 --> 00:23.200
But honestly, your risk of getting charged by a shark, extremely low.
