00:03.061 --> 00:06.539
I'm sorry. I don't want to be an emperor.

00:07.230 --> 00:09.196
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.

00:09.782 --> 00:11.419
I should like to help everyone if possible.

00:11.882 --> 00:14.687
We all want to help one another; human beings are like that.

00:15.412 --> 00:17.894
We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery.

00:18.697 --> 00:20.559
We don't want to hate and despise one another.

00:21.167 --> 00:23.249
Greed has poisoned men's souls,...

00:23.801 --> 00:25.587
...has barricaded the world with hate,...

00:26.126 --> 00:28.494
...has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.

00:29.176 --> 00:32.227
We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in.

00:32.611 --> 00:35.092
Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.

00:35.624 --> 00:37.193
Our knowledge has made us cynical.

00:37.355 --> 00:39.258
Our cleverness, hard and unkind.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.941
We think too much and feel too little.

00:42.579 --> 00:45.003
More than machinery, we need humanity.

00:45.369 --> 00:48.647
More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness.

00:49.079 --> 00:51.197
Without these qualities, life will be violent...

00:51.569 --> 00:52.719
...and all will be lost.
