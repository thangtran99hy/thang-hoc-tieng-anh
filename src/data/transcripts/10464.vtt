00:04.900 --> 00:07.000
...Charles Ingram. I'm here at Guadalupe Island.

00:07.650 --> 00:09.000
Whoa! I got a great white here.

00:30.850 --> 00:35.000
A 14-footer just hit me two or three times under the bottom of the Zodiac.

00:36.050 --> 00:37.000
There he is again.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.850
As a combat diver, a technical diver,...

00:42.900 --> 00:45.850
...and a former member of the Marine Corps's elite Special Ops unit known as Force Recon,...

00:47.550 --> 00:50.800
...I've been through a lot of dangerous situations and challenges, man. I'm telling you.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.600
The one thing that scares me is going face-to-face with a great white shark.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.800
Look at the size of the hole it made.

01:06.350 --> 01:09.000
Here he is. Look at that, the thing's bigger than my boat.

01:11.250 --> 01:12.200
That's incredible.

01:14.350 --> 01:16.700
The shark hit the pontoon of my boat hard.

01:17.050 --> 01:20.600
There was no blood in the water and nothing to directly provoke it.

01:21.050 --> 01:22.350
So what caused the attack?

01:23.300 --> 01:26.350
What drives the great white's appetite for destruction?
