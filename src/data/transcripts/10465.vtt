It's quite rare to be able to... Oh! Computer, lock the door.

00:06.800 --> 00:11.050
I am going to show you how to make the perfect champagne cocktail.

00:11.100 --> 00:16.500
A tricorder is always quite handy 'cause you need to check the standard ingredients...

00:16.550 --> 00:19.500
...to make sure they're within normal parameters.

00:19.800 --> 00:23.000
Right. We take some sugar and put it in the champagne glass.

00:23.050 --> 00:26.800
A few dashes of Angostura Bitters. That is perfect.

00:26.850 --> 00:30.100
A little dash of brandy in there. That will warm things up.

00:30.150 --> 00:32.400
See that layer there? Just a little bit of a layer?

00:32.450 --> 00:35.200
Ease the cork out. We don't want it to... Oh!

00:37.150 --> 00:38.700
That is so wrong.

00:40.800 --> 00:44.000
You got to have your thumb in the little dimple at the bottom of the glass and... Oh!

00:45.300 --> 00:47.200
I'm feeling a little bit tiddly.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.950
Oh! I'm a responsible adult.

00:51.850 --> 00:54.600
I can't wait any longer. I'm gonna have to just...

00:55.650 --> 00:57.800
I could fall in love with this.

00:57.850 --> 01:02.500
This is the perfect 'Captain's Cocktail.'

01:03.000 --> 01:03.950
Make it so.
