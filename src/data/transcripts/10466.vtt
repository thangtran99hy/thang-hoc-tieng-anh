00:03.431 --> 00:04.521
Oh! Will you help me?

00:04.785 --> 00:05.691
Can you help me?

00:06.013 --> 00:07.911
You don't need to be helped any longer.

00:08.163 --> 00:10.557
You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.

00:11.214 --> 00:12.112
I have?

00:12.447 --> 00:14.005
Then, why didn't you tell her before?

00:14.213 --> 00:15.927
Because she wouldn't have believed me.

00:16.238 --> 00:17.715
She had to learn it for herself.

00:18.383 --> 00:19.811
What have you learned, Dorothy?

00:20.849 --> 00:21.375
Well,...

00:24.180 --> 00:24.631
...I think...

00:26.035 --> 00:29.211
...that it wasn't enough just to want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

00:30.079 --> 00:34.407
And it's that, if I ever go looking for my heart's desire again,...

00:34.987 --> 00:37.690
...I won't look any further than my own backyard.

00:38.649 --> 00:40.108
Because if it isn't there,...

00:41.169 --> 00:43.353
...I never really lost it to begin with.

00:44.521 --> 00:45.292
Is that right?

00:45.948 --> 00:47.002
That's all it is!

00:47.717 --> 00:48.861
But that's so easy!

00:49.419 --> 00:50.823
I should have thought of it for you.

00:51.077 --> 00:52.559
I should have felt it in my heart.

00:52.718 --> 00:54.713
No, she had to find it out for herself.

00:54.895 --> 00:57.943
Now, those magic slippers will take you home in two seconds!
