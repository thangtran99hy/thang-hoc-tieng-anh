00:00.011 --> 00:02.750
Oh, Rhett, Rhett, please don't say that.

00:03.050 --> 00:04.200
I'm so sorry.

00:04.550 --> 00:06.350
I'm so sorry for everything.

00:08.050 --> 00:09.800
My darling, you're such a child.

00:10.550 --> 00:14.450
You think that by saying "I'm sorry", all the past can be corrected.

00:17.250 --> 00:19.150
Here, take my handkerchief.

00:19.850 --> 00:23.300
Never, at any crisis of your life, have I known you to have a handkerchief.

00:28.250 --> 00:30.750
Rhett, Rhett, where are you going?

00:31.250 --> 00:32.300
I'm going to Charleston,...

00:32.700 --> 00:33.300
...back where I belong.

00:33.350 --> 00:35.200
Please, please, take me with you.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.950
No. I'm through with everything here.

00:39.850 --> 00:40.900
I want peace.

00:41.350 --> 00:45.100
I want to see if somewhere, there isn't something left in life of charm and grace.

00:46.450 --> 00:47.450
Do you know what I'm talking about?

00:47.500 --> 00:50.150
No. I only know that I love you.

00:50.900 --> 00:52.050
That's your misfortune.

00:59.160 --> 00:59.800
Rhett!

01:02.760 --> 01:04.200
Rhett, Rhett!

01:06.450 --> 01:09.700
Rhett! If you go, where shall I go?

01:09.800 --> 01:10.700
What shall I do?

01:11.700 --> 01:13.900
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
