Hello, Rick.

00:03.300 --> 00:03.850
Hello, Louis.

00:04.100 --> 00:06.300
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that.

00:06.350 --> 00:07.700
Someday, they may be scarce.

00:08.550 --> 00:12.100
You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, huh?

00:12.250 --> 00:14.350
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.

00:24.200 --> 00:26.650
If he gets a word in, it'll be a major Italian victory.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.250
The plane to Lisbon.

00:37.350 --> 00:38.200
You would like to be on it?

00:39.200 --> 00:40.200
Why? What's in Lisbon?

00:41.000 --> 00:42.200
The clipper to America.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.750
I've often speculated on why you don't return to America.

00:45.950 --> 00:47.600
Did you abscond with the church funds?

00:48.100 --> 00:49.500
Did you run off with a senator's wife?

00:50.050 --> 00:51.400
I like to think that you killed a man.

00:51.450 --> 00:52.650
It's the romantic in me.

00:52.950 --> 00:54.500
It's a combination of all three.

00:54.600 --> 00:56.700
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.500
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.300
The waters? What waters?

01:01.650 --> 01:02.600
We're in the desert.

01:03.500 --> 01:04.800
I was misinformed.
