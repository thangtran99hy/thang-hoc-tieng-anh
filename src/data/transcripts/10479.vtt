There is only one man who can rid the politics of this state of the evil domination of Boss Jim Gettys.

00:06.230 --> 00:06.350
Hooray!

00:06.450 --> 00:08.910
I am speaking of Charles Foster Kane,...

00:09.400 --> 00:10.500
...the fighting liberal,...

00:10.650 --> 00:12.400
...the friend of the working man,...

00:12.450 --> 00:16.400
...the next governor of this state who entered upon this campaign.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.000
With one purpose only:...

00:18.350 --> 00:22.650
...to point out and make public the dishonesty,...

00:23.150 --> 00:27.700
...the downright villainy of Boss Jim W. Gettys' political machine,...

00:28.100 --> 00:32.100
...now in complete control of the government of this state!

00:32.850 --> 00:36.500
I made no campaign promises...

00:37.250 --> 00:42.000
...because until a few weeks ago, I had no hope of being elected.

00:43.400 --> 00:47.000
Now, however, I have something more than a hope...

00:48.900 --> 00:53.850
...and Jim Gettys... Jim Gettys has something less than a chance.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.400
Every straw vote,...

01:00.160 --> 01:04.160
...every independent poll shows that I'll be elected.

01:05.470 --> 01:10.050
Well then, now, I can afford to make some promises!

01:18.550 --> 01:26.750
The working man... The working man and the slum child know they can expect my best efforts in their interests.

01:27.550 --> 01:32.100
The decent, ordinary citizens know that I'll do everything in my power...

01:32.150 --> 01:37.520
...to protect the underprivileged, the underpaid, and the underfed!
