I'm Janna and I'm a professor of physics and astronomy.

00:05.505 --> 00:07.200
I work on where it all started.

00:08.305 --> 00:11.510
The simplest picture of the big bang starts with nothing.

00:11.775 --> 00:14.380
There's really nothing. There's no space. There's no time.

00:14.580 --> 00:16.280
There's no matter. There's no energy.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.550
It's nothing...

00:17.680 --> 00:19.655
...but the potential to exist...

00:20.050 --> 00:22.220
...and out of that, bursts the universe.

00:22.450 --> 00:24.990
Time starts, space is created...

00:25.125 --> 00:28.700
...all the matter and the energy in the universe is born at that moment,...

00:29.090 --> 00:32.265
...and the first minute fraction of a second, the universe inflates.

00:32.365 --> 00:35.335
And then about three minutes later, atoms begin to form.

00:35.435 --> 00:38.840
And about five billion years later, galaxies begin to form.

00:40.700 --> 00:43.240
One of these galaxies is about ten million years later.

00:43.300 --> 00:48.150
A little ordinary planet forms and 14 billion years later, people evolve.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.820
We're the last blip in the cosmic history.
