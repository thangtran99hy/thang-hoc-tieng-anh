00:00.050 --> 00:04.700
I wanted to say a few words this morning about the passing of an extraordinary leader,...

00:05.400 --> 00:07.350
...Senator Edward Kennedy.

00:08.900 --> 00:13.050
Over the past several years, I've had the honor to call Teddy a colleague,...

00:13.350 --> 00:15.400
...a counselor and a friend.

00:15.950 --> 00:20.650
And even though we have known this day was coming for some time now,...

00:20.700 --> 00:23.100
...we awaited it with no small amount of dread.

00:24.300 --> 00:30.000
Since Teddy's diagnosis last year, we've seen the courage with which he battled his illness.

00:30.550 --> 00:33.050
And while these months have no doubt been difficult for him,...

00:33.100 --> 00:37.750
...they've also let him hear from people in every corner of our nation and from around the world,...

00:38.350 --> 00:40.500
...just how much he meant to all of us.

00:41.500 --> 00:46.900
His fight has given us the opportunity we were denied when his brothers John and Robert were taken from us.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.700
The blessing of time to say thank you and goodbye.

00:52.100 --> 00:57.700
The outpouring of love, gratitude and fond memories to which we've all borne witness...

00:58.200 --> 01:03.400
...is a testament to the way this singular figure in American history touched so many lives.

01:04.100 --> 01:10.650
His ideas and ideals are stamped on scores of laws and reflected in millions of lives.

01:11.150 --> 01:13.500
In seniors who know new dignity.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.100
In families that know new opportunity.

01:16.750 --> 01:19.750
In children who know education's promise.

01:20.100 --> 01:26.750
And in all who can pursue their dream in an America that is more equal and more just.

01:27.150 --> 01:28.250
Including myself.
