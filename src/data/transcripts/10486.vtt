00:00.011 --> 00:02.200
I had a father that was touched by stroke...

00:02.570 --> 00:04.205
...and sick for seven years.

00:04.800 --> 00:07.940
We were able to get the very best in terms of health care...

00:08.400 --> 00:10.310
...because we were able to afford it.

00:11.210 --> 00:14.315
It would have bankrupted any average family in this nation.

00:14.915 --> 00:18.085
Any average family that is represented in this hall...

00:18.450 --> 00:23.325
...this afternoon, and the millions of people that you represent all over this nation of ours.

00:24.120 --> 00:26.525
I had a son that was touched by cancer.

00:26.990 --> 00:29.430
Extraordinary health bills...

00:29.895 --> 00:32.965
...that we were able to afford, and we received the very best.

00:33.600 --> 00:39.105
It would have obliterated and wiped out the savings of any family, mortgaged their savings...

00:39.200 --> 00:42.545
...and mortgaged the education of their children into the future.

00:43.240 --> 00:46.280
Seven months in the hospital I was with a broken back...

00:46.930 --> 00:49.480
...and received the very best of health care.

00:49.950 --> 00:53.355
I've been able to receive it for myself and for my family...

00:54.120 --> 00:57.525
...just like all of us around the tip of the iceberg.

00:57.925 --> 01:00.625
Way up high in the health care services.

01:01.060 --> 01:04.830
We've got the very best, all of us at the tip of the iceberg.

01:05.295 --> 01:08.865
But I want every delegate at this convention to understand...

01:09.300 --> 01:11.135
...that as long as I'm a vote...

01:11.670 --> 01:14.775
...and as long as I have a voice in the United States Senate...

01:15.040 --> 01:18.945
...it's going to be for that Democratic platform plank...

01:19.075 --> 01:21.615
that provides decent quality health care,...

01:21.815 --> 01:28.020
...north and south, east and west for all Americans, as a matter of right and not a privilege.
