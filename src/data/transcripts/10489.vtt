00:00.689 --> 00:04.290
So, to put this in perspective, we're very pleased with our year-over-year performance,...

00:04.666 --> 00:06.657
...particularly in light of the weak economy.

00:07.278 --> 00:09.995
And the economic situation continues to be tough as we all know.

00:10.881 --> 00:13.572
We saw relative stability in our business in the second quarter.

00:14.249 --> 00:16.553
It's too early for us to tell when the recovery will materialize.

00:16.651 --> 00:18.177
I wish we could just prove it, you know.

00:18.263 --> 00:19.867
We can do the analysis and figure it out.

00:20.354 --> 00:21.774
But we don't know how to do that yet.

00:22.639 --> 00:25.518
So, when the recovery does come and it always eventually comes,...

00:25.656 --> 00:27.167
...we are very well-positioned for the future,...

00:27.235 --> 00:30.147
...given our constant and continuing investment in innovation.

00:30.803 --> 00:31.438
So with that, Patrick.

00:31.618 --> 00:32.362
Thank you very much.

00:32.552 --> 00:32.787
 Go ahead.
