What we see unlocked:...

00:03.200 --> 00:12.100
...The invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community.

00:13.500 --> 00:19.600
What these pictures demonstrate is that we do feel the pain of others, however distantly.

00:20.400 --> 00:26.700
What I think these pictures demonstrate is we do believe in something bigger than ourselves.

00:27.500 --> 00:33.950
What these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions,...

00:34.000 --> 00:35.300
...across all faiths,...

00:35.500 --> 00:36.725
...across all continents.

00:36.850 --> 00:40.775
A moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others...

00:40.900 --> 00:44.150
...and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act...

00:44.500 --> 00:46.800
...when we see things that are wrong that need righted,...

00:46.850 --> 00:49.250
...see injuries that need to be corrected,...

00:49.500 --> 00:52.650
...see problems that need to be rectified.

00:53.750 --> 00:57.100
There's a story about Olof Palme, the Swedish Prime Minister...

00:57.150 --> 00:59.800
...going to see Ronald Reagan in America in the 1980s.

01:00.550 --> 01:02.400
And before he arrived, Ronald Reagan said,...

01:02.500 --> 01:04.300
...and he was the Swedish Social Democratic Prime Minister,...

01:04.350 --> 01:05.600
..."Isn't this man a communist?"

01:06.950 --> 01:10.750
And the reply was, "No, Mr. President. He's an anti-communist".

01:11.000 --> 01:13.750
And Ronald Reagan said, "I don't care what kind of communist he is!".

01:17.700 --> 01:22.650
And Ronald Reagan asked, Olof Palme, the Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden,...

01:23.050 --> 01:26.100
..."Well, what do you believe in? Do you want to abolish the rich?".

01:26.550 --> 01:29.300
And he said, "No, I want to abolish the poor".

01:29.350 --> 01:35.500
Our responsibility is to let everyone have the chance to realize their potential to the full.
