The beginning of any collaboration starts with a conversation...

00:04.688 --> 00:09.226
...and I would like to share with you some of the bits of the conversation that we started with.

00:10.283 --> 00:14.118
I grew up in a log cabin in Washington state with too much time on my hands...

00:14.245 --> 00:16.131
...and in scenic Switzerland for me.

00:17.540 --> 00:20.221
I always had a passion for alternative vehicles.

00:20.377 --> 00:23.646
This is a land yacht racing across the desert in Nevada.

00:24.167 --> 00:28.043
A combination of windsurfing and skiing into this invention there.

00:28.829 --> 00:31.689
And I also had an interest in dangerous inventions.

00:31.849 --> 00:36.251
This is a 100,000 volt Tesla coil that I built in my bedroom,...

00:36.422 --> 00:38.281
...much to the dismay of my mother.

00:40.013 --> 00:44.346
To the dismay of my mother, this is dangerous teenage fashion right there.

00:47.973 --> 00:50.595
And I brought this all together, this passion with alternative energy,...

00:50.659 --> 00:53.205
...and raced a solar car across Australia,...

00:53.304 --> 00:54.773
...also the U.S. and Japan.

00:55.790 --> 00:59.135
So, wind power, solar power, we had a lot to talk about.

00:59.261 --> 01:02.297
We had a lot that got us excited.

01:02.684 --> 01:05.460
So, we decided to do a special project together,...

01:05.537 --> 01:08.820
...to combine engineering and design, and...

01:09.295 --> 01:11.924
...really make a fully integrated product, something beautiful.

01:12.319 --> 01:13.235
And we made a baby.

01:15.789 --> 01:17.058
Can you bring out our baby?

01:25.727 --> 01:27.258
This baby is fully electric.

01:28.727 --> 01:30.155
It goes 150 miles an hour.

01:30.463 --> 01:33.440
It's twice the range of any electric motorcycle.

01:33.674 --> 01:39.700
We really... The exciting thing about a motorcycle is just the beautiful integration of engineering and design.

01:40.321 --> 01:43.005
And it's got an amazing user experience.

01:43.545 --> 01:45.013
It was wonderful working with Yves Behar.

01:45.107 --> 01:46.738
He came up with our name and logo. 

01:46.813 --> 01:47.634
We're Mission Motors.

01:48.324 --> 01:50.325
And we've only got three minutes.

01:50.431 --> 01:51.973
But we could talk about it for hours.

01:52.197 --> 01:52.474
Thank you.

01:53.829 --> 01:54.421
Thank you TED.

01:54.622 --> 01:56.255
And thank you Chris, for having us.
