00:00.450 --> 00:03.250
Speaking at a packed hall like Cairo University,...

00:03.300 --> 00:06.900
...President Obama said after decades of frustration and distrust,...

00:07.150 --> 00:11.200
...it is time for candor, for dialog and a fresh start.

00:11.600 --> 00:18.000
I've come here to Cairo to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.300
One based on mutual interest and mutual respect.

00:22.500 --> 00:27.100
He said both sides need to reject stereotypes and speak the truth.

00:27.850 --> 00:31.300
But I am convinced that in order to move forward,...

00:32.350 --> 00:36.800
...we must say openly to each other the things we hold in our hearts...

00:37.700 --> 00:41.150
...and that too often are said only behind closed doors.

00:42.700 --> 00:45.450
There must be a sustained effort to listen to each other.

00:46.550 --> 00:47.850
To learn from each other.

00:48.850 --> 00:50.250
To respect one another.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.550
And to seek common ground.

00:53.150 --> 00:56.700
Mr. Obama said they must face their differences head-on...

00:56.850 --> 01:00.000
...and forge a partnership to confront joint challenges.

01:00.150 --> 01:02.650
From violent extremism, to Iran,...

01:02.750 --> 01:04.600
...to the Arab-Israeli conflict.

01:04.950 --> 01:09.100
Turning to the peace process, the president called for a dose of reality.

01:09.300 --> 01:15.200
Using the term Palestine, he said the U.S. does not accept the legitimacy of Israeli settlements.

01:15.350 --> 01:19.650
And that both sides must acknowledge the right of the other to exist.

01:19.900 --> 01:23.350
But if we see this conflict only from one side or the other,...

01:24.700 --> 01:26.750
...then we will be blind to the truth.

01:28.450 --> 01:34.500
The only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states,...

01:34.650 --> 01:39.200
...where Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security.
