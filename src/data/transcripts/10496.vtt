Election officials in Afghanistan are still counting ballots in the Presidential election.

00:06.957 --> 00:10.750
But the final result expected later this month could be delayed.

00:11.050 --> 00:17.900
And Afghan Election Commission says, it still must clear about 650 serious complaints of fraud.

00:18.200 --> 00:23.700
Many of the complaints have been lodged against supporters of incumbent President Hamid Karzai.

00:24.138 --> 00:28.500
His main challenger, former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah told reporters,...

00:28.650 --> 00:31.050
...he's concerned about the election process...

00:31.100 --> 00:34.100
...and wants the international community to investigate.

00:34.298 --> 00:37.400
My concern is that if we cannot save this process,...

00:37.750 --> 00:41.050
...if the future government of Afghanistan is based on fraud,...

00:41.300 --> 00:43.500
...on top of every other problems that we have,...

00:43.650 --> 00:45.150
...there will be illegitimate rule.

00:45.200 --> 00:51.150
Abdullah's comments came as the New York Times quoted unnamed Afghan and Western officials...

00:51.250 --> 00:57.000
...as saying Mr. Karzai's supporters created as many as 800 fake polling stations...

00:57.150 --> 01:00.400
...that produced hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes.

01:00.700 --> 01:05.300
The Times says, the votes counted for Mr. Karzai at some polling stations...

01:05.553 --> 01:09.350
...may be ten times higher than the number of people who actually voted.

01:09.650 --> 01:15.500
Mr. Karzai's supporters have so far denied taking part in efforts to rig the election.
