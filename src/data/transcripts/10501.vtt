Jessica Grounds is president of the nonpartisan Women under Forty Political Action Committee...

00:06.000 --> 00:07.200
...based in Washington.

00:07.650 --> 00:14.450
Secretary Clinton has done something by bringing these global women's issues to a top priority...

00:14.500 --> 00:16.500
...and that every decision goes through that office,...

00:16.550 --> 00:20.450
...because oftentimes women's issues tend to be an outlier piece,...

00:20.500 --> 00:22.500
...sort of, maybe like a minority group.

00:22.617 --> 00:25.776
Grounds says, she thinks Clinton's international fame...

00:25.974 --> 00:28.343
...will boost her efforts to empower women.

00:28.700 --> 00:31.450
I think that she is so well received internationally...

00:31.500 --> 00:35.500
...and that was one of the best reasons to choose her by President Obama,...

00:35.550 --> 00:36.650
...to choose her for Secretary of State.

00:36.700 --> 00:42.800
She already had an amazing connection with leaders around the world from her experience as First Lady.

00:42.900 --> 00:47.500
She made that a priority, to build relationships with other women heads of state,...

00:47.850 --> 00:49.700
...Angela Merkel and all of that.

00:49.750 --> 00:54.050
Now, we have a whole cadre of new women leading nations around the world.

00:54.147 --> 00:56.591
Some critics say, Clinton needs to make sure...

00:56.665 --> 01:00.770
...that terrorism and nuclear proliferation are her top priorities,...

01:00.950 --> 01:02.650
...and not women's rights.

01:03.100 --> 01:08.300
Lawrence Wilkerson was chief of staff to former Secretary of State Colin Powell.

01:08.500 --> 01:11.300
Women's rights are high on my list of things to do.

01:11.350 --> 01:14.000
To empower the rest of the world that's not empowered...

01:14.400 --> 01:15.900
...but it's not the top priority.

01:15.950 --> 01:19.300
There are many more things that take priority over that.

01:19.400 --> 01:24.500
Wilkerson also says, Clinton needs to tread carefully in certain parts of the world...

01:24.750 --> 01:28.500
...on pushing governments to respect and empower women.

01:28.950 --> 01:32.400
But in societies where women's rights are severely curtailed...

01:32.450 --> 01:34.100
...like Afghanistan, for example.

01:34.533 --> 01:37.885
Then, we need to be very circumspect and very cautious,...

01:37.961 --> 01:39.584
...and prudent about the way we move...

01:39.600 --> 01:43.300
...towards empowering women, although it's important.

01:43.393 --> 01:45.265
There are others however who say,...

01:45.379 --> 01:49.239
...Clinton must use her unique position to push women's rights...

01:49.633 --> 01:53.995
...because so many women are still the victims of violence and repression...

01:54.255 --> 01:55.475
...in many parts of the world,...

01:55.800 --> 01:59.650
...making women's rights the moral challenge of our times.

01:59.950 --> 02:02.000
