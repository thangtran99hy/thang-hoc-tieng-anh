00:01.550 --> 00:03.000
Now, this is the plan I'm proposing.

00:04.350 --> 00:07.850
It's a plan that incorporates ideas from many of the people in this room tonight,...

00:08.250 --> 00:09.800
...Democrats and Republicans.

00:10.750 --> 00:13.500
And I will continue to seek common ground in the weeks ahead.

00:14.600 --> 00:18.150
If you come to me with a serious set of proposals,...

00:18.650 --> 00:19.900
...I will be there to listen.

00:20.700 --> 00:22.700
My door is always open.

00:24.850 --> 00:27.100
But know this:...

00:28.300 --> 00:31.500
...I will not waste time with those who have made the calculation...

00:31.600 --> 00:34.950
...that it's better politics to kill this plan than to improve it.

00:42.800 --> 00:48.200
I won't stand by while the special interests use the same old tactics to keep things exactly the way they are.

00:49.450 --> 00:52.250
If you misrepresent what's in this plan,...

00:52.750 --> 00:53.700
...we will call you out.

00:57.950 --> 01:01.700
And I will not accept the status quo as a solution.

01:02.100 --> 01:02.900
Not this time.

01:03.550 --> 01:04.200
Not now.
