Hello! I'm VOA's Rebecca Ward for Going Green.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.150
Thanks for joining us today.

00:08.300 --> 00:11.700
Where as you could see: It's as green as green can be.

00:18.450 --> 00:20.300
School's out. Summer's in,...

00:20.400 --> 00:26.100
...with kids all over the United States trading in their textbooks for less studious activities.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.900
Except that is for hundreds of kids in Washington...

00:30.100 --> 00:32.800
...who are learning firsthand about the environment they live in.

00:32.850 --> 00:34.700
These tools work.

00:34.750 --> 00:39.100
This is the District of Columbia's 2nd Annual Green Summer Youth Program.

00:39.400 --> 00:42.200
And these kids are definitely going green.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.489
So, the opportunity for the kids at the district...

00:44.588 --> 00:48.435
...is they'll have a chance to get in on the green revolution at the ground floor,...

00:48.800 --> 00:51.100
...right now, when it's just beginning to bloom.

00:51.300 --> 00:52.850
It's a tremendous opportunity.

00:53.650 --> 00:56.850
These are not work that you can't imagine yourself doing if you don't know enough about.

00:56.900 --> 01:00.600
These are entry level to any kind of career. Everything is open.

01:00.950 --> 01:04.600
George Hawkins is the director of the District Department of the Environment.

01:04.850 --> 01:10.600
He is working with the mayor's office to teach inner city youth how to appreciate and care for their environment.
