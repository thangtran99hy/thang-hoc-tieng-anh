Hello! I'm VOA's Rebecca Ward.

00:05.900 --> 00:08.300
You know, going green isn't just about recycling,...

00:08.400 --> 00:10.950
...it's about conservation and protection.

00:12.050 --> 00:15.200
"They lent to Alexander the strength of Hercules,..."

00:15.350 --> 00:18.400
"...the wisdom of their foreheads and the cunning of their knees."

00:18.650 --> 00:21.350
...so says Jungle Book author, Rudyard Kipling.

00:21.550 --> 00:26.050
But even the mighty elephant is no match for illegal wildlife traffickers.

00:26.100 --> 00:33.800
Most people think today that the greatest threat to wildlife might be global warming,...

00:34.250 --> 00:35.900
...might be loss of habitat.

00:36.450 --> 00:39.400
But for those of us who are in this particular business,...

00:39.850 --> 00:44.800
...we see poaching as a major threat to the continued survival of many of the,...

00:45.050 --> 00:47.450
...we call charismatic animals that are out there.

00:47.500 --> 00:50.850
John Webb is a prosecutor with the US Justice Department.

00:50.900 --> 00:56.000
Globally, it's estimated to be between five to twenty billion dollars annually.

00:56.200 --> 01:03.600
The People's Republic of China and ourselves are the two biggest demand-side countries in the illegal trade.

01:03.750 --> 01:07.900
Webb says ivory from Africa is in high demand among illegal traders...

01:08.050 --> 01:12.400
...and from Southeast Asia, tiger parts for traditional Chinese medicines.

01:12.700 --> 01:16.400
This despite a treaty signed by 175 countries...

01:16.600 --> 01:20.700
...to prevent the illegal trafficking of wildlife, both dead and alive.
