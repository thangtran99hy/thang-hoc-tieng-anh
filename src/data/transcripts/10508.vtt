Hello, I'm VOA's Rebecca Ward for Going Green...

00:07.600 --> 00:11.100
...where you are about to learn more about recycling than you even cared to know.

00:12.100 --> 00:13.150
It goes in here.

00:14.600 --> 00:16.900
But where does it go from there?

00:17.500 --> 00:21.750
(MRFs) material recovery facilities, and there are a variety of those now in the area,...

00:22.250 --> 00:25.250
...have used technology to sort the various components.

00:25.600 --> 00:31.500
That means paper, plastic, cardboard, metal cans, almost anything can be tossed into the recycle bin.

00:31.750 --> 00:35.300
Erik Grabowsky is with Arlington County's solid waste division.

00:35.350 --> 00:38.250
We're trying to make it very convenient for our citizens.

00:38.300 --> 00:41.450
We have what we call an "Integrated Solid Waste Management" program...

00:41.700 --> 00:45.450
...which provides a comprehensive level of service to our citizens.

00:45.650 --> 00:48.300
And it's not only got regular trash collection...

00:48.500 --> 00:50.600
...it's gonna have single stream recycling.

00:50.650 --> 00:52.900
We also have a brush collection program.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.300
We have a separate metals collection program.

00:55.500 --> 01:00.200
And one of the things we've just added along with single stream is electronics recycling collection curbside.

01:00.300 --> 01:05.500
The United States generates more than 230,000 kilograms of trash a year.

01:05.800 --> 01:09.700
Of that, about 33% is recycled in one form or another.

01:10.050 --> 01:14.800
In Arlington, Virginia, just outside Washington, recycling rate is 42%,...

01:14.900 --> 01:16.600
...higher than the national average.

01:16.950 --> 01:19.050
But that number can, and should go higher,...

01:19.100 --> 01:22.650
...once people realize just how much stuff is recyclable.
