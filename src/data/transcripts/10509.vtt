00:03.770 --> 00:06.770
A fuel efficient Hummer? Impossible you say.

00:10.040 --> 00:14.370
The gas mileage of a Toyota Prius with a hauling capability of a truck.

00:14.680 --> 00:19.650
That's how David West of Raser Technologies describes the electric powered Hummer.

00:19.785 --> 00:23.080
What we really need is something that has great gas mileage but also has a payload,...

00:23.180 --> 00:26.025
...'cause we do stuff as Americans. We share rides when you go to the soccer game,...

00:26.225 --> 00:28.060
...we don't wanna drive six Priuses to the soccer game.

00:28.295 --> 00:30.465
We wanna drive one Hummer with all kids, all six kids in it.

00:31.590 --> 00:37.370
Last week, US President Barack Obama unveiled some strict and sooner than expected fuel standards...

00:37.570 --> 00:39.405
...for automobile manufacturers.

00:39.640 --> 00:45.675
By the year 2016, he wants US cars and trucks to average about 15 kilometers per liter.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.580
We have set in motion a national policy...

00:48.915 --> 00:52.085
...aimed at both increasing gas mileage...

00:52.385 --> 00:59.470
...and decreasing greenhouse gas pollution for all new trucks and cars sold in the United States of America.

00:59.720 --> 01:04.640
President Obama's proposal would increase current auto fuel efficiency by about 30%.

01:04.895 --> 01:07.955
Some argue that places a hardship on American auto makers...

01:08.190 --> 01:11.170
...at a time when they're facing serious financial difficulty.

01:11.270 --> 01:12.875
Gasoline's about $2.50 a gallon.

01:13.205 --> 01:17.845
But David West of Raser Technologies says, their electric Hummer shows it can be done,...

01:18.110 --> 01:21.280
...and it can be done in a car that consumers want to buy.

01:21.645 --> 01:24.885
If you can make a hummer green, you've solved the big problem...

01:25.110 --> 01:28.890
...because you can convert the rest of America's fleets to green technology.
