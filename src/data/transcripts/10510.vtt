Hello everyone! I'm VOA's Rebecca Ward for Going Green.

00:05.850 --> 00:08.150
But today, we're actually going blue.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.050
In honor of the world's oceans.

00:11.150 --> 00:15.200
Without water, the earth would be just another ordinary planet in the solar system.

00:15.400 --> 00:20.050
But our vast, blue ocean sustain life on land as well as underwater.

00:20.300 --> 00:23.500
That's why the World Ocean's conference in Coral Triangle Summit...

00:23.813 --> 00:25.665
...brought together leaders and environmentalists...

00:25.748 --> 00:28.396
...from more than a hundred countries in Manado, Indonesia.

00:28.550 --> 00:33.500
The initial idea on it was to really bring world experts into the Coral Triangle region...

00:34.150 --> 00:38.200
...and focus on major fishery issues and major marine issues around the world.

00:38.300 --> 00:42.500
It then became much more of a climate change focused event.

00:42.900 --> 00:46.200
When we think of climate change, polar bears often come to mind...

00:46.350 --> 00:49.500
...but warming weather is not just a threat to the Arctic ice cap.

00:49.900 --> 00:55.150
Frazer McGilvray is director of the Coral Triangle Initiative at Conservation International.

00:55.223 --> 00:59.277
There are some experts now saying that by the end of the century...

00:59.384 --> 01:00.575
...that we could see a hundred,...

01:00.600 --> 01:03.400
...we could see a sea level rise of one meter,...

01:03.900 --> 01:07.500
...which is massive in certain parts of the world.

01:07.550 --> 01:13.000
Warmer water will affect the marine life quite severely, particularly coral reefs.

01:13.300 --> 01:16.400
If we exceed those thermal limits, the coral reefs will die.
