Hello and welcome to Going Green.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.945
In today's edition, we're in Eastern Maryland,...

00:09.240 --> 00:12.375
...where we're gonna take a look at a unique oyster growing program.

00:13.010 --> 00:15.630
There's more beauty in the oysters than just the pearl.

00:16.120 --> 00:17.725
Take a close look at these babies.

00:17.985 --> 00:20.620
They may look dirty but they're teeming with life.

00:20.850 --> 00:22.125
You see, these are barnacles.

00:22.680 --> 00:25.725
The barnacles are coming out of their shells to feed.

00:26.190 --> 00:28.290
And I guess they haven't figured it out that they're out of the water yet.

00:28.725 --> 00:31.030
They're continuing to feed, pretty soon they'll close up.

00:31.325 --> 00:34.135
Chris Judy is with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources,...

00:34.280 --> 00:38.070
...the state agency that's helping to rejuvenate the Chesapeake Bay's oyster reefs...

00:38.270 --> 00:40.875
...and boost the overall population of the shellfish...

00:41.030 --> 00:42.375
...which has been in decline.

00:42.540 --> 00:45.945
The Marylanders Grow Oysters program was started by Governor O'Malley last year...

00:46.220 --> 00:49.280
...and has a couple of basic features. One is stewardship.

00:49.750 --> 00:53.720
Pier owners, who used their piers for perhaps boats and other things for fun...

00:53.920 --> 00:55.870
...are now using their piers to grow oysters.

00:56.070 --> 00:57.225
Another key component...

00:57.455 --> 00:59.325
...is enhancing the oyster population.
