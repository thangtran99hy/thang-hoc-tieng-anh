Hello everybody, I'm VOA's Rebecca Ward for Going Green.

00:06.627 --> 00:09.314
The U.S. Congress, along with President Barack Obama,...

00:09.472 --> 00:12.703
...have been considering legislation to cap carbon emissions.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.100
But what about the damage that's already been done by pollution?

00:18.800 --> 00:23.550
Hollywood actress Ashley Judd and host of Animal Planet's "Corwin's Quest", Jeff Corwin,...

00:23.700 --> 00:27.900
...recently appeared before Congress to appeal for funding for wildlife protection.

00:28.200 --> 00:31.100
We caught up with them at the Hart Senate Building here in Washington...

00:31.250 --> 00:34.400
...where they were more than happy to talk about their conservation concerns.

00:34.450 --> 00:37.600
My testimony today was on behalf of defenders of wildlife...

00:37.727 --> 00:40.553
...which is advocating that in the global warming bill...

00:40.643 --> 00:41.898
...that will hopefully be passed,...

00:42.250 --> 00:47.850
...5% of the revenue generated from cap and trade, carbon dioxide emissions...

00:47.900 --> 00:52.400
...will be used to protect and restore wildlife and ecosystems.

00:52.700 --> 00:57.600
Really important today is that we're stressing the fact that it's not just reducing global warming...

00:57.650 --> 01:00.850
...but that we address the impact already felt on the ground...

01:00.900 --> 01:04.300
...and the impact that will continue to reverberate for centuries.

01:04.500 --> 01:08.400
For biologist Jeff Corwin, the effects of climate change are personal.

01:08.450 --> 01:10.800
My daughter Maya and my daughter Marina...

01:10.900 --> 01:13.997
...the truth is that when they are young women,...

01:15.124 --> 01:18.700
...it's very likely that 30% of the wildlife alive today,...

01:18.600 --> 01:20.700
...the species, not that we just cherish,...

01:20.900 --> 01:24.500
...but that we depend upon economically for our survival, will not be here.

01:24.700 --> 01:25.600
I mean, try to imagine that.

01:25.750 --> 01:30.900
That's one species of life disappearing today every 20 minutes.
