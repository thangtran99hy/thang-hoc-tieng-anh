Hello everyone, I'm VOA's Rebecca Ward.

00:05.360 --> 00:08.140
And we're going green whenever and wherever we can.

00:08.470 --> 00:10.310
We go to Kenya for this first story...

00:10.485 --> 00:14.980
...and speak with the coauthor of a study about the danger facing some native species.

00:15.845 --> 00:20.755
Wild grazing animals are disappearing from Kenya's cherished Masai Mara National Reserve.

00:21.120 --> 00:25.990
That's according to a new study by the Nairobi-based International Livestock Research Institute.

00:26.290 --> 00:27.695
The reason, says in the report,...

00:27.960 --> 00:30.530
...is human encroachment on the borders of the reserve.

00:30.895 --> 00:32.965
Joseph Ogutu co-authored the study.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.400
He spoke to us by phone from Nairobi.

00:35.700 --> 00:42.000
One of the significant causes of the decline is just the loss of the habitat...

00:42.340 --> 00:46.335
...and then the deduction in the quality of the habitat or...

00:46.545 --> 00:48.515
...the degradation of the habitat if you like.

00:48.980 --> 00:51.885
Another thing is the increase in the number of settlements...

00:52.150 --> 00:55.555
...and these are on ranch lands which are bordering the south.

00:55.655 --> 00:59.325
What you're seeing in the Mara is just one example...

00:59.490 --> 01:04.495
...of a general pattern that is actually happening all over Kenya.

01:04.630 --> 01:10.705
Researchers say more permanent human settlements have led to dramatic drops in populations of six hoofed species...

01:10.905 --> 01:13.575
...including giraffes, impala, and warthogs.

01:13.840 --> 01:17.075
The study appears in next month's British Journal of Zoology.
