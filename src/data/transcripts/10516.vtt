Hello everyone, I'm VOA's Rebecca Ward for Going Green.

00:06.403 --> 00:08.536
Or, should I say, greens.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.041
Freshly picked from the farm to the table...

00:11.253 --> 00:13.592
...even in a metropolitan area like Washington.

00:13.908 --> 00:15.727
According to the Department of Agriculture,...

00:15.828 --> 00:19.721
...more than 12,000 farms in the United States are part of a CSA:...

00:19.918 --> 00:21.786
...Community Supported Agriculture.

00:22.089 --> 00:25.822
That's where a family or individual buys a share of the farm's produce.

00:26.029 --> 00:30.417
Hiu Newcomb and her daughter Hana own Potomac Vegetable Farms just outside Washington.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.999
The farmers' markets and the CSA combined...

00:33.297 --> 00:35.977
...have really altered the landscape of how we get our money.

00:36.521 --> 00:39.334
1980s were, I think, the first farmers' markets.

00:39.459 --> 00:41.542
And our first CSA, it was in 2000.

00:41.632 --> 00:44.219
So between 1980 and 2000, we're getting bigger and bigger.

00:44.966 --> 00:47.203
But the CSA, it's really changed the way,...

00:47.583 --> 00:49.526
...we're far more in control than we used to be.

00:49.995 --> 00:54.611
Hard to believe that neither Hiu Newcomb nor her husband had any experience in farming...

00:54.796 --> 00:57.676
...when they first got started 30 something years ago.

00:57.922 --> 00:58.909
But we weren't farmers.

00:59.013 --> 01:01.719
My husband did not come from a farming background, nor did I.

01:02.086 --> 01:09.205
And I think he just had a thought that he would like to someday create a utopian community.
