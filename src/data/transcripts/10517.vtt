Clinton made the release of the report, a major event that included Congressional leaders...

00:05.030 --> 00:09.375
...and activists from around the world saluted these anti-trafficking heroes.

00:09.800 --> 00:16.425
The trafficking of persons for forced labor, sexual exploitation and other illicit purposes, Clinton said,...

00:16.715 --> 00:21.320
...is modern-day slavery and affects every country including the United States.

00:21.585 --> 00:25.960
She said the annual report is aimed at encouraging nations to act.

00:26.460 --> 00:31.430
We hope to shine the light brightly on the scope and scale of modern slavery...

00:31.630 --> 00:34.935
...so all governments can see where progress has been made,...

00:35.160 --> 00:36.600
...and where more is needed.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.470
Trafficking thrives in the shadows...

00:39.840 --> 00:45.955
...and it can be easy to dismiss it as something that happens to someone else, somewhere else,...

00:46.780 --> 00:48.140
...but that's not the case.

00:48.215 --> 00:55.110
The report assessed 175 countries based on information from US embassies and non-governmental groups,...

00:55.355 --> 00:58.325
...it gave 17 of them the lowest rating.

00:58.655 --> 01:04.465
The countries rated worst include Burma, North Korea, Fiji and Papua New Guinea in Asia.

01:04.730 --> 01:06.700
In Latin America, Cuba.

01:06.865 --> 01:12.395
In the Middle East and Africa; Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Sudan.

01:12.615 --> 01:19.545
Chad, Niger, Zimbabwe and Malaysia had poor ratings last year and are in the lowest category this year.

01:19.915 --> 01:25.650
Eritrea, Mauritania and Swaziland are also listed in the so-called, Tier 3.

01:26.085 --> 01:31.720
At the same time, Algeria, Oman, Qatar and Moldova, Tier 3 last year...

01:31.855 --> 01:35.395
...are all recognized this year for anti-trafficking efforts.

01:35.600 --> 01:40.000
Luis de Baca is the State Department's anti-trafficking coordinator,...

01:40.150 --> 01:44.350
...he said, the main point of the exercise is to encourage improvement.

01:44.450 --> 01:46.000
The successes are clear,...

01:46.600 --> 01:49.650
...some former Tier 2 watch list countries are now Tier 1.

01:50.150 --> 01:53.600
They have become models through their efforts for their regions and for the world.
