I wanted to apologize first to the lineswoman, to the USTA,...

00:09.949 --> 00:11.383
...to my fans most of all,...

00:11.514 --> 00:14.707
...and to Kim Clijsters who ended up having such a wonderful tournament...

00:14.797 --> 00:16.919
...and winning the championship.

00:16.991 --> 00:18.743
And what an amazing feat that was.

00:22.721 --> 00:25.037
For a major emotional outburst that I had...

00:25.111 --> 00:26.659
...and I think, which I pretty much covered it.

00:26.738 --> 00:29.830
And I just really wanted to apologize sincerely,...

00:29.899 --> 00:32.527
...because I am a very prideful person,...

00:32.595 --> 00:33.783
...and I'm a very emotional person.

00:33.857 --> 00:35.093
I'm a very intense person...

00:35.157 --> 00:36.629
...and I think, it all showed.

00:36.727 --> 00:40.201
And most of all, I am a very sincere person.

00:40.652 --> 00:44.705
I wanted to offer my sincere apologies to anyone that I may have offended...

00:45.001 --> 00:49.225
...and I would like to again thank the fans for all the support that I've gotten.

00:49.621 --> 00:52.818
And I think that's awesome, and I think it's cool that I've gotten so much support.

00:52.920 --> 00:53.941
And I appreciate everything.
