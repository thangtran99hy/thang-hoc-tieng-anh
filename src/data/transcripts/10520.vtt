00:02.700 --> 00:06.200
President Barack Obama took his healthcare reform plan on the road...

00:06.400 --> 00:07.500
...and to the people.

00:07.700 --> 00:08.700
Hello everybody!

00:10.100 --> 00:14.900
This town hall meeting in Ohio comes at a time when congress is struggling to agree...

00:14.950 --> 00:18.400
...on a way to pay for a plan to reform America's healthcare.

00:18.650 --> 00:21.900
The estimated price tag: one trillion dollars.

00:22.200 --> 00:28.050
I won't sign it if that reform adds even one dime to our deficit over the next decade...

00:28.100 --> 00:29.550
...and I mean what I say.

00:30.050 --> 00:34.600
The president is pushing for a plan that will prevent insurance companies from dropping coverage,...

00:34.750 --> 00:37.500
...he also wants limits on out-of-pocket cost.

00:37.700 --> 00:43.300
Bills in the house and senate would require most businesses to provide health insurance for their employees,...

00:43.500 --> 00:46.100
...all Americans would also have to get health insurance.

00:46.300 --> 00:49.700
Discounts would be available for anyone who can't afford it.

00:49.900 --> 00:55.350
Cancer survivor Angela Kegwell McDowell says she can't get insurance even if she can afford it...

00:55.550 --> 00:57.650
...because of her pre-existing condition.

00:57.850 --> 00:59.200
I'm too high of a risk...

00:59.350 --> 01:01.300
...so no matter how much I could afford,...

01:01.500 --> 01:04.400
...I cannot get insurance right now through our system.

01:04.700 --> 01:07.600
You won't have to worry about pre-existing conditions...

01:08.200 --> 01:14.100
...because never again will anyone in America be denied coverage,...

01:14.200 --> 01:16.350
...because of a previous illness or injury.
