21-year-old Julian Lage has been playing guitar since he was five.

00:08.050 --> 00:13.950
I certainly felt like it was no effort to play the guitar.

00:14.050 --> 00:15.450
It's fun. It was really fun.

00:15.500 --> 00:18.800
And it stayed that way for my whole childhood.

00:22.450 --> 00:26.700
The film 'Jules At Eight' gave a glimpse of what life for Lage was like then...

00:26.800 --> 00:29.850
...when people began to understand the talent he had.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.100
People would approach me and my parents.

00:32.800 --> 00:37.500
And my parents are great at seeing through their offer...

00:37.550 --> 00:41.150
...in saying, "You know what, maybe sending Julian across the country,..."

00:41.200 --> 00:44.650
"...do this and be on the city show, maybe that's not the best thing for him."

00:45.050 --> 00:47.850
If they were looking to make money off me,...

00:47.900 --> 00:52.400
...which a lot of parents might have to and... or might want to,...

00:53.100 --> 00:55.300
...I would have turned out quite differently.

00:55.850 --> 01:01.400
Which may be why he didn't release his first CD, Sounding Point, until this March.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.100
I could've recorded when I was younger.

01:05.050 --> 01:11.750
But I think the biggest issue for me was wanting to step forward with more than just the music.

01:14.800 --> 01:17.900
Lage has an original sound according to music critics.

01:18.300 --> 01:22.950
That originality is probably why we are still hearing about Julian Lage.
