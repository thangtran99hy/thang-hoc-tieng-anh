Apollo 11 Mission Commander Neil Armstrong will forever be remembered for setting foot on the moon...

00:06.700 --> 00:09.415
...and uttering these immortal words:...

00:09.875 --> 00:12.145
..."That's one small step for man,...

00:14.715 --> 00:17.350
...one giant leap for mankind."

00:17.755 --> 00:22.855
Now he says, the space race between the United States and the former Soviet Union...

00:23.020 --> 00:27.625
...that culminated with the Apollo missions served a valuable purpose.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.465
It was the ultimate...

00:32.430 --> 00:34.465
...peaceful competition.

00:35.465 --> 00:37.770
USA versus USSR.

00:39.595 --> 00:44.345
It was intense. It did allow both sides to take the high road,...

00:45.175 --> 00:48.785
...with the objectives of science and learning and exploration.

00:50.315 --> 00:53.420
Eventually, it provided a mechanism...

00:53.920 --> 00:56.390
...for engendering cooperation...

00:57.055 --> 00:58.725
...between former adversaries.

00:59.890 --> 01:05.265
In that sense, among others, it was an exceptional national investment for both sides.

01:05.630 --> 01:10.770
Images of Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin Buzz Aldrin on the moon...

01:11.000 --> 01:15.040
...were seen by more than half a billion enraptured viewers on Earth.

01:15.275 --> 01:19.785
To this day, the Apollo 11 Mission remains one of humanity's greatest...

01:19.980 --> 01:23.080
...and most celebrated technological achievements.
