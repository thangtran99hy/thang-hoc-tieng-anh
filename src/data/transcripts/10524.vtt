00:04.200 --> 00:09.650
The singer died, according to the coroner, from a deadly dose of the anesthetic propofol...

00:09.900 --> 00:13.600
...combined with Lorazepam, an anti-anxiety medication.

00:14.050 --> 00:20.100
Jackson's doctor, Conrad Murray, told investigators that he gave the pop star a series of drugs;...

00:20.150 --> 00:21.500
...Starting with Valium....

00:21.750 --> 00:23.000
...and then Lorazepam,...

00:23.050 --> 00:24.400
...followed by a sedative,...

00:24.700 --> 00:27.050
...all so Jackson would be able to sleep.

00:27.450 --> 00:28.900
The drugs didn't work.

00:29.350 --> 00:34.400
Early the next morning, Dr. Murray gave Jackson propofol intravenously.

00:34.900 --> 00:37.600
The drug is designed for hospital use only.

00:39.050 --> 00:43.400
Dr. Rick Levy is Vice Chief of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine...

00:43.450 --> 00:46.200
...at the Children's National Medical Center in Washington,...

00:46.600 --> 00:51.100
...he says, propofol is a drug of choice for anesthesiologists.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.400
The anesthesiologists generally do like it around the world...

00:54.450 --> 01:00.750
...because it's more designed for the faster onset in terms of going off to sleep,...

01:00.800 --> 01:02.950
...and the faster offset in terms of waking up,...

01:03.000 --> 01:05.900
...so for outpatient ambulatory surgery,...

01:05.950 --> 01:09.050
...that really was the niche market it was designed for.

01:09.500 --> 01:12.800
Propofol puts patients to sleep in seconds.

01:12.950 --> 01:15.900
The drug is also used with other anesthetics...

01:16.100 --> 01:19.300
Because it's not a controlled substance yet,...

01:20.300 --> 01:23.400
...it's much easier to access within the operating room.

01:23.600 --> 01:27.150
...and because propofol is not a controlled substance,...

01:27.350 --> 01:31.300
...other doctors can get it, even if they are not trained in using it,...

01:31.500 --> 01:33.300
...and that's where they can get in trouble.

01:33.800 --> 01:36.800
Propofol can cause patients to stop breathing...

01:37.300 --> 01:41.900
...but in the operating room, anesthesiologists are equipped to resuscitate them.

01:42.350 --> 01:46.700
Propofol can also lead to trouble with blood pressure and heart function.

01:46.900 --> 01:54.400
Much of anesthesiology and intensive care are really being able to manage those patients...

01:54.450 --> 02:01.150
...and those responses that are outside of what the expected is so that you still keep the patient safe.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.800
Propofol is not designed to be a sleep aid, ever.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.400
