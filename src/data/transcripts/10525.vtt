Natasha Bedingfield has become one of the most popular female singers in the last few years.

00:12.400 --> 00:17.400
She spent all of 2008 on tour promoting her latest CD, Pocketful of Sunshine.

00:17.650 --> 00:23.300
Natasha found love last year when she became engaged to California businessman Matt Robinson.

00:23.350 --> 00:24.150
He stole my heart,...

00:24.300 --> 00:25.300
...you know, I was holding out.

00:25.350 --> 00:28.150
...and my first song was called Single.

00:28.200 --> 00:32.850
It was about being solo and proud of it, and independent,...

00:32.900 --> 00:37.700
...and I really didn't just fall for any person, really,...

00:37.750 --> 00:39.600
...but yeah, he won my heart.

00:47.200 --> 00:50.600
With three Top 10 Billboard Chart singles from her latest album,...

00:50.750 --> 00:54.650
...Natasha says, the thrill starts before the record is even released.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.800
It's amazing when you are in the studio and you get that excitement,...

00:57.900 --> 00:59.400
...you feel like a kind of buzz,...

00:59.600 --> 01:04.800
...and you kinda want to test it out because that's what the next stage really is.

01:05.200 --> 01:07.650
You might like something, but do other people like it?

01:07.700 --> 01:08.800
You know, when someone comes up to me and goes,..

01:08.850 --> 01:13.300
...this is our song or my song, you know. That's very special.

01:13.450 --> 01:16.150
Not only is Natasha expanding as a performer,...

01:16.250 --> 01:19.550
...her new CD also demonstrates her songwriting ability.
