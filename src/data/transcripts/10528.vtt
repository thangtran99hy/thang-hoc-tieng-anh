00:00.650 --> 00:02.000
But make no mistake...

00:03.250 --> 00:06.400
...this cannot solely be America's endeavor.

00:07.750 --> 00:11.850
Those who used to chastise America for acting alone in the world...

00:11.900 --> 00:16.700
...cannot now stand by and wait for America to solve the world's problems alone.

00:19.300 --> 00:22.350
We have sought in word and deed,...

00:22.850 --> 00:25.100
...a new era of engagement with the world.

00:25.950 --> 00:28.100
This body is made up of sovereign states.

00:29.050 --> 00:31.300
And sadly, but not surprisingly,...

00:31.350 --> 00:36.450
...this body has often become a forum for sowing discord instead of forging common ground.

00:37.600 --> 00:41.800
A venue for playing politics and exploiting grievances rather than solving problems.

00:43.350 --> 00:47.200
After all, it is easy to walk up to this podium and point figures,...

00:47.500 --> 00:49.400
...point fingers and stoke divisions.

00:50.500 --> 00:53.600
Nothing is easier than blaming others for our troubles,...

00:54.300 --> 00:58.400
...and absolving ourselves of responsibility for our choices and our actions.

00:58.600 --> 00:59.600
Anybody can do that.

01:01.700 --> 01:05.750
Responsibility and leadership in the 21st century demand more.
