The administration's decision to scrap plans for a long range missile defense system...

00:06.981 --> 00:10.999
...in Poland and the Czech Republic was defended by Secretary Clinton...

00:11.069 --> 00:13.384
...in her speech at the Brookings Institution.

00:13.715 --> 00:17.743
On Thursday, government officials said, they favor a system aimed at countering...

00:17.991 --> 00:20.887
...the medium range missiles Iran currently has.

00:21.353 --> 00:26.208
Clinton said, the new plan, relying heavily at first on sea-based missile interceptors...

00:26.570 --> 00:30.461
...will mean that an effective system will be deployed years earlier...

00:30.547 --> 00:33.103
...than the approach taken by the Bush administration.

00:33.447 --> 00:38.047
She repeated the US-NATO commitment to the Warsaw and Prague governments...

00:38.345 --> 00:44.265
...and she insisted, Russian opposition didn't play into President Obama's calculations,...

00:44.543 --> 00:47.359
This decision was not about Russia,...

00:48.014 --> 00:54.433
...it was about Iran and the threat that its ballistic missile program poses.

00:54.974 --> 00:56.662
And because of this position,...

00:57.011 --> 01:02.535
...we believe we will be in a far stronger position to deal with that threat.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.023
And to do so with technology that works,...

01:06.273 --> 01:08.569
...and a higher degree of confidence...

01:08.975 --> 01:13.201
...that what we pledged to do, we can actually deliver.
