These images of what appear to be butterfly wings were taken by the upgraded Hubble Telescope.

00:06.950 --> 00:10.100
The areas that resemble wings are actually folds of gas...

00:10.200 --> 00:13.500
...reaching temperatures of more than 19,000 degrees Celsius.

00:13.850 --> 00:19.000
The gases are released by a dying star that was once five times the mass of the Earth's sun.

00:19.250 --> 00:22.950
The Hubble Telescope's new and repaired cameras captured these images.

00:23.150 --> 00:27.600
The telescope was upgraded by astronauts during a billion-dollar mission in May.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.800
NASA Administrator Charles Bolden is a former astronaut who piloted the space shuttle...

00:32.850 --> 00:35.200
...that put Hubble in orbit 19 years ago.

00:35.250 --> 00:38.400
After almost 20 years of service, our view of the universe...

00:38.550 --> 00:40.700
...and our place within it will never be the same.

00:41.100 --> 00:46.700
These pictures of galaxies and nebulas are sharper than photos taken by Hubble before the upgrade.

00:46.850 --> 00:48.500
Scientist Dave Leckrone.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.500
This is nature's telescope.

00:50.550 --> 00:54.150
This is taking the power of Hubble and enhancing it tremendously...

00:54.200 --> 00:59.000
...so that we can actually study detailed structures and galaxies that are incredibly faraway.

00:59.250 --> 01:03.800
Leckrone said, since the repairs, there have not been any technical problems with Hubble.

01:04.050 --> 01:07.200
The first photos from the repaired telescope came in July...

01:07.250 --> 01:11.550
...when it took pictures of Jupiter after an asteroid or comet struck the planet.

01:11.900 --> 01:17.000
Research scientist Heidi Hammel called the improvements a major step for space research.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.200
With this new beginning for Hubble,...

01:19.600 --> 01:23.100
...we can now see more clearly, and understand more deeply...

01:23.250 --> 01:28.300
...the processes that create and shape, and drive change within our universe.

01:28.400 --> 01:32.500
NASA says, the new instruments can complete observations in a fraction of the time...

01:32.600 --> 01:35.650
...that was needed with earlier generations of Hubble equipment.

01:35.950 --> 01:38.050
