00:02.700 --> 00:08.800
Health officials, battling the first flu pandemic in 41 years, got some good news recently.

00:09.100 --> 00:13.400
Just one dose of vaccine appears to protect most adults.

00:13.700 --> 00:18.300
US Secretary of Health Kathleen Sebelius said, the news was encouraging.

00:18.550 --> 00:25.700
It now appears that most of the folks have a robust immune response...

00:25.750 --> 00:30.750
...in eight to ten days from the date of the first vaccine, which is very positive news.

00:31.400 --> 00:36.800
A US vaccine study has proven to be just as effective as a vaccine trial in Australia.

00:37.300 --> 00:39.900
The news is surprising and welcome.

00:42.300 --> 00:44.000
With more vaccine available,...

00:44.200 --> 00:50.400
...this means, the H1N1 vaccine can inoculate twice as many people throughout the world.

00:50.800 --> 00:55.000
Dr. Anthony Fauci is with the US National Institutes of Health.

00:55.250 --> 01:00.000
In essence, it mitigates some of the problems that we're talking about...

01:00.050 --> 01:04.900
...when you talk about decreased or not decreased, but inadequate supplies for everyone.

01:05.150 --> 01:12.300
US health officials say, 98% of the flu cases they're seeing are caused by the H1N1 virus.

01:12.750 --> 01:15.600
The vaccine should be available by mid-October.

01:15.950 --> 01:18.100
But schools are already open.

01:18.650 --> 01:20.450
The weather is turning cooler.

01:20.650 --> 01:24.100
And the flu season is under way in the northern hemisphere.
