00:12.050 --> 00:13.500
But I wanna show you a different approach,...

00:13.750 --> 00:15.500
...and this is this robot over here,..

00:16.150 --> 00:22.050
...which has four legs. It has eight motors, four on the knees and four on the hip.

00:22.100 --> 00:27.200
It has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine how it... which way it's tilting.

00:27.700 --> 00:30.400
But this machine doesn't know what it looks like.

00:30.450 --> 00:31.950
You look at it and you see it has four legs,..

00:32.000 --> 00:34.200
...the machine doesn't know if it's a snake, if it's a tree,...

00:34.400 --> 00:36.600
...it doesn't have any idea what it looks like,...

00:36.750 --> 00:38.400
...but it's gonna try to find that out.

00:38.450 --> 00:40.700
So initially, it does some random motion...

00:41.350 --> 00:43.900
...and it then... it tries to figure out what it might look like,...

00:43.950 --> 00:46.000
...and you're seeing a lot of things passing through its mind.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.263
There's a lot of self-models...

00:48.345 --> 00:51.567
...that try to explain the relationship between actuation and sensing,...

00:51.800 --> 00:53.600
...and then, tries to do a second action...

00:53.967 --> 00:58.708
...that creates the most disagreement among predictions of these alternative models,...

00:58.789 --> 01:00.081
...like a scientist in a lab.

01:00.200 --> 01:04.700
Then it does that and tries to explain that, and prune out its self-models.

01:04.750 --> 01:06.700
This is already the last cycle...

01:06.800 --> 01:10.100
...and you can see it's pretty much figured out what itself looks like,...

01:10.150 --> 01:15.800
...and once it has a self-model, it can use that to derive a pattern of locomotion.

01:15.850 --> 01:19.900
So, what you're seeing here are a couple of machines... a pattern of locomotion.

01:19.950 --> 01:24.000
We were hoping that it's gonna have a kind of evil, spidery walk...

01:24.050 --> 01:28.100
...but instead, it created this pretty lame way of moving forward.

01:28.150 --> 01:29.200
But when you look at that,...

01:29.550 --> 01:36.350
...you have to remember that this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward...

01:36.550 --> 01:38.400
...nor did it have a model of itself.

01:38.450 --> 01:40.100
It kinda figured out what it looks like...

01:40.350 --> 01:41.400
...and how to move forward,...

01:41.550 --> 01:45.400
...and then, actually tried that out.
