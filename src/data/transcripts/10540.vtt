00:19.679 --> 00:21.135
So, as researchers,...

00:21.277 --> 00:25.566
...something we often do is use immense resources to achieve certain capabilities...

00:25.600 --> 00:27.000
...or achieve certain goals...

00:27.300 --> 00:31.450
...and this is essential to the progress of science or exploration of what is possible.

00:31.587 --> 00:34.103
But it sorta creates this unfortunate situation...

00:34.202 --> 00:36.021
...where a tiny, tiny fraction of the world...

00:36.000 --> 00:38.100
...can actually participate in this exploration...

00:38.200 --> 00:40.000
...or can benefit from that technology.

00:40.150 --> 00:43.350
And something that motivates me, and what gets me really excited about my research...

00:43.400 --> 00:47.250
...is when I see simple opportunities to drastically change that distribution,...

00:47.400 --> 00:51.100
...and then, make the technology accessible to a much wider percentage of the population.

00:51.350 --> 00:54.400
And I'm gonna show you two videos that have gotten a lot of attention recently...

00:54.820 --> 00:56.400
...that I think embody this philosophy.

00:56.600 --> 00:59.000
And they actually use the Nintendo Wii remote.

00:59.465 --> 01:01.605
Now, for those of you who aren't familiar with this device,...

01:01.686 --> 01:04.268
...it's a 40-dollar video game controller...

01:04.400 --> 01:07.400
...and it's mostly advertised for its motion sensing capabilities,...

01:07.450 --> 01:09.900
...so you can swing a tennis racket or hit a baseball bat.

01:10.550 --> 01:14.450
But what actually interests me a lot more is the fact that in the tip of each controller...

01:14.550 --> 01:17.400
...is a relatively high-performing infrared camera,...

01:17.650 --> 01:21.900
...and I'm gonna show you two demos of why this is useful.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.050
So, here I have my computer setup with the projector...

01:25.100 --> 01:27.200
...and I have a Wii remote sitting on top of it.

01:27.500 --> 01:31.200
And if for example, if you're in a school that doesn't have a lot of money,...

01:31.250 --> 01:32.600
...which is probably a lot of schools...

01:32.750 --> 01:36.000
...or if you're in an office environment, and you want an interactive whiteboard,...

01:36.150 --> 01:39.050
...normally, this costs about two to three thousand dollars.

01:39.100 --> 01:42.600
So, what I'm going to show you how to do is how to create one with a Wii remote.

01:43.350 --> 01:48.450
Now, this requires another piece of hardware, which is this infrared pen.

01:48.850 --> 01:52.500
You can probably make this yourself for about five dollars with a quick trip to the Radio Shack.

01:52.700 --> 01:55.700
It's essentially got a battery, a button and an infrared LED,...

01:55.800 --> 01:59.100
...and it turns on, you guys can't see it but it turns on whenever I push the button.

01:59.200 --> 02:03.100
Now, what this means is that if I run this piece of software,...

02:04.050 --> 02:05.500
...I can now register,...

02:05.550 --> 02:07.500
...the camera sees the infrared dot...

02:08.250 --> 02:13.450
...and I can register the location of the camera pixels to the projector pixels,...

02:13.650 --> 02:15.900
...and now, this is an interactive whiteboard surface.

02:18.100 --> 02:21.600
So, for about 50 dollars of hardware, you can have your own whiteboard.

02:22.050 --> 02:23.900
This is Adobe Photoshop.

02:29.950 --> 02:30.300
Thank you.
