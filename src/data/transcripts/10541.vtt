00:18.250 --> 00:19.050
So, cut to now.

00:19.100 --> 00:21.250
We have... still have an energy crisis...

00:21.300 --> 00:23.200
...and now, we have a climate crisis as well.

00:23.900 --> 00:29.000
You know, so, humans generate about 12 trillion watts or 12 terawatts from fossil fuels...

00:29.350 --> 00:33.000
...and Al Gore has spoken to why we need to hit one of these targets,...

00:33.400 --> 00:36.800
...and in reality, what that means is in the next 30 to 40 years,...

00:36.950 --> 00:42.700
...we have to make ten trillion watts or more of new clean energy, somehow.

00:43.500 --> 00:48.500
Wind is the second largest renewable resource after solar: 3600 terawatts,...

00:48.550 --> 00:51.100
...more than enough to supply humanity 200 times over.

00:51.350 --> 00:55.550
The majority of it is in the higher altitudes, above 300 feet,...

00:55.850 --> 00:58.600
...where we don't have the technology as yet to get there.

00:59.250 --> 01:01.600
So, this is the dawn of the new age of kites.

01:01.800 --> 01:05.700
This is our test site on Maui, flying across the sky.

01:05.950 --> 01:09.900
I'm now going to show you the first autonomous generation of power...

01:10.550 --> 01:12.750
...by every child's favorite plaything.

01:13.100 --> 01:16.850
As you can tell, you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.450
It makes you a little nauseous.

01:18.850 --> 01:21.050
And here we're actually generating about 10 kilowatts,...

01:21.100 --> 01:24.800
...so enough to power probably five United States households,...

01:24.950 --> 01:27.250
...with a kite not much larger than this piano.

01:27.550 --> 01:32.600
And the real significant thing here is we're developing the control systems, as did the Wright brothers,...

01:32.700 --> 01:36.250
...that would enable sustained, long duration flight.

01:36.350 --> 01:39.200
And it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either.
