So, it was about four years ago, five years ago,...

00:21.500 --> 00:24.100
...I was sitting on a stage in Philadelphia, I think it was...

00:24.400 --> 00:26.000
...with a bag similar to this...

00:26.600 --> 00:28.800
...and I was pulling a molecule out of this bag,...

00:28.900 --> 00:32.500
...and I was saying, "You don't know this molecule really well,...

00:32.750 --> 00:35.150
...but your body knows it extremely well",...

00:35.550 --> 00:38.900
...and I was thinking that your body hated it, at the time,...

00:38.950 --> 00:40.650
...because we are very immune to this.

00:40.700 --> 00:42.350
This is called, alpha-gal epitope...

00:42.400 --> 00:45.700
...and the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them...

00:45.950 --> 00:49.700
...is the reason that you can't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.400
Actually, what with... our body doesn't hate these,...

00:52.650 --> 00:54.000
...our body loves these,...

00:54.100 --> 00:54.800
...it eats them.

00:55.300 --> 00:58.100
I mean, the cells in our immune system are always hungry...

00:58.600 --> 01:03.257
...and if an antibody is stuck to one of these things on the cell,...

01:03.330 --> 01:04.917
...it means, that's food.

01:05.350 --> 01:07.000
Now, I was thinking about that and I said, "You know,...

01:07.050 --> 01:11.600
...we've got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we don't make,...

01:11.650 --> 01:14.300
...and you know, we see it a lot in other animals and stuff",...

01:14.800 --> 01:17.250
...but I said, "Why... we can't get rid of it",...

01:17.300 --> 01:21.550
...because all of the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you can't get rid of that immunity.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.400
I said, "Why don't you use that?"

01:23.700 --> 01:25.800
What if I could stick this molecule,...

01:26.550 --> 01:31.600
...slap it onto a bacteria that was pathogenic to me, that had just invaded my lungs?

01:32.050 --> 01:36.200
I mean, I could immediately tap into an immune system that was there...

01:36.250 --> 01:39.250
...or where... this was not gonna take five or six days to develop it,...

01:39.600 --> 01:42.700
...it was gonna immediately attack whatever this thing was on.

01:42.750 --> 01:44.700
It was kinda like the same thing that happens when you,...

01:44.750 --> 01:48.560
...like you... getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A....

01:49.033 --> 01:51.631
...and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car,...

01:51.743 --> 01:53.775
...and then, charges you for possession of marijuana.

01:53.950 --> 01:57.800
It's like the very fast, very efficient way to get people off the street.
