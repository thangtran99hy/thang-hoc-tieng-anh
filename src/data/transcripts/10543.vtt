00:13.200 --> 00:16.400
I'm wearing a camera, just a simple webcam.

00:16.750 --> 00:22.400
A portable, battery powered projection system with a little mirror.

00:22.800 --> 00:26.400
These components communicate to my cellphone in my pocket...

00:26.450 --> 00:30.850
...which acts as the communication and computation device.

00:30.900 --> 00:34.900
And in the video here, we see my student Pranav Mistry,...

00:34.950 --> 00:39.600
...who's really the genius, who's been implementing and designing this whole system.

00:39.900 --> 00:46.950
And we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands...

00:47.100 --> 00:51.600
...to interact with the information that is projected in front of him.

00:51.850 --> 00:56.150
The system tracks the four significant fingers.

00:56.200 --> 01:01.150
In this case, he's wearing simple marker caps that you may recognize...

01:01.450 --> 01:07.350
...but if you want a more stylish version, you could also paint your nails in different colors.

01:07.650 --> 01:11.200
And the camera basically tracks these four fingers,...

01:11.250 --> 01:19.400
...and recognizes any gestures that he's making, so he can just go to... for example, a map of Long Beach,...

01:19.450 --> 01:21.250
...zoom in and out, et cetera.

01:21.900 --> 01:27.400
The system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the take-a-picture gesture...

01:27.450 --> 01:30.500
...and then, takes a picture of whatever is in front of you.

01:31.200 --> 01:34.150
And when he then walks back to the Media Lab,...

01:34.200 --> 01:39.300
...he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he's taken,...

01:39.550 --> 01:43.000
...sort through them and organize them, and resize them, et cetera,...

01:43.150 --> 01:46.750
...again using all natural gestures.

01:47.150 --> 01:50.900
So, some of you most likely were here two years ago...

01:51.100 --> 01:55.800
...and saw the demo by Jeff Han, or some of you may think,...

01:55.850 --> 01:58.550
..."Well, doesn't this look like the Microsoft Surface Table?"...

01:58.900 --> 02:04.750
...and yes, you also interact using natural gestures, both hands, et cetera,...

02:05.200 --> 02:08.250
...but the difference here is that you can use any surface.

02:08.300 --> 02:10.700
You can walk up to any surface,...

02:10.750 --> 02:13.750
...including your hand if nothing else is available...

02:14.650 --> 02:17.600
...and interact with this projected data.

02:17.750 --> 02:20.600
The device is completely portable.
