It took Mei Wei Zhen Restaurant's chef Bai Wei...

00:03.751 --> 00:08.855
...two days to put together this concoction of butter, sugar, flour and dried strawberries.

00:09.267 --> 00:11.569
The icebergs are made with whipped egg whites.

00:13.262 --> 00:16.199
This dish was made every day for the Empress Dowager,...

00:16.401 --> 00:18.657
...but it wasn't made to eat, just to look at.

00:19.776 --> 00:23.065
China's last dynasty fell nearly a century ago.

00:23.413 --> 00:26.609
The People's Republic of China was founded in 1949...

00:26.729 --> 00:29.515
...with a strongly anti-imperialist vision.

00:30.563 --> 00:34.191
Mei Wei Zhen did not allow VOA to film while people were dining...

00:34.304 --> 00:37.108
...because it said its customers prefer to remain discreet,...

00:37.530 --> 00:38.673
...but the pictures on the wall....

00:38.760 --> 00:42.046
...indicate that at least some of the patrons are from the new elite...

00:42.416 --> 00:46.384
...people like Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and basketball star Yao Ming.

00:47.594 --> 00:52.630
Mei Wei Zhen's location also suggests its clients have ambitions of commercial success.

00:52.974 --> 00:54.617
It is at the China World Trade Center,...

00:54.719 --> 00:58.179
...with one entrance on the street level and one entrance in the shopping mall.

00:59.180 --> 01:01.944
Chef Bai comes from a family of imperial chefs.

01:02.280 --> 01:06.155
His grandfather prepared food for Puyi, the last emperor of China.

01:06.549 --> 01:11.183
The food he prepares now is a meticulous recreation of imperial recipes...

01:11.251 --> 01:15.317
...he researched in the archives of the Forbidden City, where the emperor lived.

01:16.219 --> 01:19.471
This dish, when I finished making it, it's very satisfying.

01:19.945 --> 01:22.913
Not only is it delicious, it's also like a piece of art.

01:23.245 --> 01:24.796
I can't bring myself to eat it, though.

01:25.283 --> 01:28.328
He acknowledges imperial food is much more expensive...

01:28.408 --> 01:32.547
...than the cost of the mostly common ingredients like leeks or potatoes,...

01:32.900 --> 01:35.925
...but he says this food and its complex preparation...

01:36.257 --> 01:39.545
...are cultural traditions of China and should be priceless.
