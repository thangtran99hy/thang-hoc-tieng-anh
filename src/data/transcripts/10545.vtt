Hey guys, this is Emily.

00:02.969 --> 00:06.572
And today, we're gonna talk about tipping in America.

00:06.993 --> 00:08.324
Do you know what tipping is?

00:08.747 --> 00:09.634
I bet you don't.

00:09.723 --> 00:10.633
Maybe you do.

00:10.902 --> 00:14.631
But tipping is when you pay money to someone who has done a service for you,...

00:15.006 --> 00:19.493
...such as a waiter, a waitress, a hot bartender,...

00:19.734 --> 00:23.704
...a person at Starbucks, a taxi driver, et cetera, et cetera.

00:23.963 --> 00:27.768
But you have to pay these people because their salaries are really low.

00:28.222 --> 00:32.527
Unlike in Japan, where you just get ripped off with the table charge occasionally.

00:33.663 --> 00:37.997
But yeah, you're supposed to pay the person 20% of what they gave you.

00:38.077 --> 00:42.367
So, they sold you pasta for ten dollars, give them a two-dollar tip...

00:42.610 --> 00:44.432
...or more if you're feeling super generous.

00:44.518 --> 00:45.703
I don't know, I'm bad with math.

00:46.110 --> 00:50.969
That was never what I was good at in school, I failed twice, I think.

00:52.704 --> 00:55.393
Anyway, if you don't tip your waiter or waitress,...

00:55.651 --> 00:59.411
...it means that either the service was really bad or you're a jerk.

00:59.783 --> 01:00.972
No one likes to be a jerk.

01:01.077 --> 01:02.149
I know I don't.

01:02.922 --> 01:07.057
But I mean, sometimes when your service is really bad or you've had a rough day...

01:07.137 --> 01:09.775
...or you're in a bad mood, it's okay not to tip.

01:10.365 --> 01:14.089
But just be prepared, because the person that you've gypped on the tip might come after you...

01:14.425 --> 01:17.055
...with a pocket knife or pepper spray.

01:17.552 --> 01:20.367
Because everyone has weapons, all the time.

01:20.441 --> 01:23.617
It's like "Street Fighter", only you're not in the street, you're in America.

01:23.693 --> 01:25.482
Maybe on the street in America.

01:26.651 --> 01:31.072
So if you go to America, tip a guy and tell him, "Have a nice day!"...

01:31.139 --> 01:34.113
...because everyone likes to feel good about themselves.

01:35.387 --> 01:36.267
I'm sure you do.

01:36.769 --> 01:40.428
Anyway, this has been Emily, telling you about tipping in America.

01:41.019 --> 01:42.243
See you next time!
