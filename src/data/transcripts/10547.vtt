00:02.250 --> 00:05.101
Less than four months after blastoff from Earth,...

00:05.250 --> 00:09.322
...the Centaur rocket in LCROSS spacecraft slammed into the moon,...

00:09.200 --> 00:12.350
...just as Project Manager Dan Andrews hoped they would.

00:12.850 --> 00:17.733
I'm happy to report that the spacecraft performed beautifully throughout the mission.

00:17.755 --> 00:20.000
The operations team drove it well.

00:20.250 --> 00:23.550
The mission aimed to confirm the presence of water on the moon.

00:23.700 --> 00:28.200
As shown in this animation, scientists expected a giant plume of dirt and dust,...

00:28.350 --> 00:31.500
...possibly with evidence of water produced by the crashes.

00:31.750 --> 00:37.250
But it was difficult to see any debris in pictures beamed back to Earth by the satellite before impact.

00:37.500 --> 00:40.700
The principal investigator in the mission, Anthony Colaprete, said...

00:40.800 --> 00:44.908
...it is too early to draw conclusions about whether a dust cloud existed.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.800
But if there was no plume...

00:46.950 --> 00:47.700
We lose some.

00:47.750 --> 00:51.411
We lose, you know, what we hope to get out of the ejected cloud was...

00:51.500 --> 00:55.350
...an ability to say "Aha! we see this much stuff, this much dirt",...

00:55.650 --> 00:59.500
...and we could somehow relate that to how much actually came out of the crater.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.150
Colaprete says his team focused on the Cabeus crater,...

01:03.250 --> 01:07.100
...an area near the moon's south pole that is permanently in the dark.

01:07.300 --> 01:11.900
If there is water on the moon, it could be frozen in that crater indefinitely.

01:12.150 --> 01:15.933
Even if the pictures are not definitive, instruments on the spacecraft,...

01:15.989 --> 01:17.550
...combined with observers on Earth...

01:17.700 --> 01:20.900
...and the Hubble Telescope collected data from the mission.

01:21.100 --> 01:26.100
It could take up to 2 months before scientists can conclude if water exists here.
