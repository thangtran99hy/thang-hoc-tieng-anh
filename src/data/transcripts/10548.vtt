White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs...

00:03.535 --> 00:08.624
...called to wake President Obama early Thursday with the unexpected news.

00:09.215 --> 00:11.943
I think it's safe to say he was very surprised.

00:12.027 --> 00:14.085
Less than a year after taking office,...

00:14.171 --> 00:18.241
...Mr. Obama is joining an elite group of recognized peacemakers...

00:18.491 --> 00:23.375
...that includes Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama and Martin Luther King Jr.

00:23.810 --> 00:26.763
Mr. Obama's tone was one of humility.

00:27.935 --> 00:33.396
To be honest, I do not feel that I deserve to be in the company...

00:34.123 --> 00:37.292
...of so many of the transformative figures who have been honored by this prize.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.893
Men and women who've inspired me,...

00:40.627 --> 00:44.888
...and inspired the entire world through their courageous pursuit of peace.

00:45.511 --> 00:48.233
Global reaction was swift and varied.

00:48.501 --> 00:54.024
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon described the peace prize as "great news".

00:54.358 --> 00:58.890
President Obama embodies the new spirit of dialog and engagement...

00:59.187 --> 01:00.995
...on the world's biggest problems,...

01:01.484 --> 01:07.456
...climate change, nuclear disarmament, and a wide range of peace and security challenges.

01:07.725 --> 01:13.247
Several Nobel Laureates were in agreement, including South Africa's Desmond Tutu.

01:13.790 --> 01:18.198
It's an award that anticipates an even greater contribution...

01:19.897 --> 01:22.974
...towards making our world a safer place for all.

01:23.273 --> 01:27.505
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter described the Obama selection as...

01:27.579 --> 01:30.873
...a bold statement of international support for his vision...

01:31.097 --> 01:34.985
...and commitment to peace and harmony in international relations.
