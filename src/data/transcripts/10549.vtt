I started noticing when they will have these... the town hall meetings...

00:07.575 --> 00:12.600
...and there was vitriol, and general animosity, and anger, and shouting, and pushing,...

00:12.800 --> 00:15.550
...and just an unsavory behavior reported.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.100
Now, I don't know if it was generally speaking but it would be reported here and there.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.900
And then, within the last week,...

00:21.900 --> 00:26.700
...a couple of days ago, Jimmy Carter started talking about this behavior...

00:26.950 --> 00:35.300
...and was speculating that perhaps this unease or poor decorum...

00:35.600 --> 00:38.300
...was because people was rooted in racism.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.650
Is he onto something there?

00:40.700 --> 00:42.750
Or is that just something to talk about?

00:42.800 --> 00:46.300
Well, first of all, I think it's important to realize that...

00:46.750 --> 00:48.750
...I was actually black before the election.

00:55.000 --> 00:55.500
Really?

00:55.750 --> 00:56.300
This is true.

01:00.750 --> 01:02.450
How long have you been a black man?

01:04.600 --> 01:09.450
And so, the American people, I think gave me this extraordinary honor.

01:10.350 --> 01:14.450
And that tells you, I think a lot about where the country's at.

01:15.750 --> 01:18.650
I actually think that what's happened is that...

01:19.450 --> 01:23.600
...whenever a president tries to bring about significant changes,...

01:24.150 --> 01:26.300
...particularly during times of economic unease,...

01:26.850 --> 01:35.450
...then there is a certain segment of the population that gets very riled up and it happened.

01:35.550 --> 01:38.250
FDR was called a socialist and a communist.

01:39.900 --> 01:43.450
JFK, there were all kinds of names hurled at him.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.975
Ronald Reagan, when he came into office, he was moving in a different direction...

01:47.025 --> 01:51.070
...and people were sure that he was bringing the country down.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.700
And so, this is not untypical.

01:54.700 --> 01:57.900
One of the things you sign up for in politics is folks yell at 'ya.

02:02.200 --> 02:09.000
But I think that what has been missing from the conversation is that the overwhelming majority of people.

02:10.200 --> 02:14.000
Republican or Democrat, I think they just wanna see some common sense.

02:14.050 --> 02:18.100
They wanna see some honesty and integrity in Washington.

02:18.350 --> 02:22.000
I think they're turned off by the shouting and the yelling,...

02:22.550 --> 02:26.925
...and they expect more from their public elected officials.
