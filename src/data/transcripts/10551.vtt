00:00.050 --> 00:03.200
Some of them are vegetarians so they won't eat you.

00:03.650 --> 00:05.900
Children know dinosaurs.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.600
Even though they've never actually seen one.

00:09.400 --> 00:17.000
T-Rex and stegosaurus, triceratops, and... ankylosaurus.

00:17.150 --> 00:19.250
How old are they? I don't even know.

00:21.300 --> 00:22.300
Kinda like your parents?

00:22.400 --> 00:23.300
Yeah, kind of.

00:23.350 --> 00:25.450
But dinosaurs are extinct, right?

00:25.500 --> 00:26.700
They don't really live, right?

00:27.500 --> 00:33.100
They do! The real ones are in there!

00:34.800 --> 00:35.900
He's right.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.850
Inside, it's a travel back in time,...

00:39.050 --> 00:43.350
...more than a hundred million years ago, when dinosaurs ruled.

00:44.550 --> 00:47.300
This is a baby brachiosaurus and its mother.

00:47.500 --> 00:53.300
She towers above the arena at 11 meters tall and 17 meters long.

00:53.700 --> 00:57.500
The bracs are part of the traveling show, "Walking with Dinosaurs".

00:57.800 --> 01:03.050
It's a 20-million-dollar production, where animatronics add to the realism.

01:03.300 --> 01:05.200
Here's how it works in rehearsals.

01:06.850 --> 01:11.200
Stegosaurus lumbers in at 5 and 1/2 meters tall and 11 meters high.

01:11.550 --> 01:14.450
Next to him stands the armored ankylosaurus.

01:14.800 --> 01:21.800
The 17 dinosaurs in the show are covered with elasticized mesh filled with polystyrene balls.

01:22.200 --> 01:27.800
The fabric skin contracts and stretches across muscles and bones, just like on real creatures.

01:29.850 --> 01:33.450
Three people activate each dinosaur by remote control.

01:35.750 --> 01:40.100
Two of them stand among the audience and work at what's called a voodoo rig.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.200
The voodoo rig is actually a mechanical miniaturized version of a dinosaur.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.500
This is the body.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.200
This is the area of the spine and the neck.

01:49.300 --> 01:50.400
And, this is the head.

01:50.600 --> 01:53.000
So, when the puppeteer moves the apparatus,...

01:53.050 --> 01:57.000
...it remotely sends a signal to the floor and, in turn, the dinosaur moves.
