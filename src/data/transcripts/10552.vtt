Bikers in New York are all over the place.

00:04.700 --> 00:09.500
There are fast bikers, leisurely bikers and of course, working bikers.

00:09.700 --> 00:13.550
Now, there's a new type of biker on the horizon, the bamboo biker.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.450
Thanks to a group of innovative guys in New York.

00:16.900 --> 00:19.600
Bamboo Bike Studio co-owner, Marty Odlin...

00:19.750 --> 00:24.000
...says, the great thing about bamboo is that it's sustainable and plentiful.

00:24.300 --> 00:28.300
Our specific bamboo grows all throughout in New York City.

00:28.350 --> 00:32.300
We generally go to places that have like large quantities of bamboo...

00:32.600 --> 00:35.650
...and most of the people are really happy for us to take it.

00:36.050 --> 00:41.200
In fact, bamboo grows so fast, it's like a weed and people are eager to get rid of it.

00:41.450 --> 00:44.100
Odlin and his partners work out of a small studio,...

00:44.150 --> 00:48.450
...where they're developing the prototype of a bamboo bike they hope to one day sell.

00:49.650 --> 00:53.400
They collect the bamboo, cut it and weld it to make it more durable.

00:53.700 --> 00:57.600
The company holds weekend classes to teach people how to make their own bikes.

00:57.700 --> 01:01.450
At more than a thousand dollars a course, it's not exactly cheap...

01:01.650 --> 01:04.550
...but Odlin says, the money is going to a good cause.

01:04.800 --> 01:09.600
The goal is to use the profits to bring bamboo bike technology to developing countries.

01:09.700 --> 01:12.150
A bicycle in a developing country right now,...

01:12.200 --> 01:16.800
...popular Chinese steel bicycle, is about a 110 to 120 dollars.

01:17.550 --> 01:24.150
A bamboo bike, made locally, with local labor could cost about 55 dollars,...

01:24.800 --> 01:27.150
...if you make it out of a really, you know, on a large scale.

01:27.500 --> 01:31.000
So, what that does, is that it provides cheap transportation...

01:31.050 --> 01:34.900
...to a massive part of the population that can afford it right now.

01:35.100 --> 01:40.800
Odlin says, he and his partners are pouring all of their income into startup costs and technology.

01:41.350 --> 01:45.200
But one expense he doesn't have to worry about is transportation.

01:45.850 --> 01:48.400
