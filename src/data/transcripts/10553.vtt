00:00.100 --> 00:01.835
Change is blowing in China...

00:02.035 --> 00:05.395
...in the form of green technologies like these wind turbines.

00:05.605 --> 00:07.440
For each of the last four years,...

00:07.540 --> 00:10.310
...China has doubled its wind energy capacity.

00:10.710 --> 00:14.180
In this year, the People's Republic is set to overtake the US...

00:14.345 --> 00:17.520
...as the world's top manufacturer of wind turbines.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.690
Generally speaking, I think China's wind power business is booming.

00:23.185 --> 00:26.025
In the next decade, China believes it can match Europe...

00:26.120 --> 00:29.865
...by producing a fifth of its energy needs from renewable sources.

00:30.195 --> 00:33.430
China is striving to become a clean energy superpower...

00:33.730 --> 00:36.570
...even as the United States moves to do the same.

00:36.970 --> 00:41.540
There's no longer a question about whether the jobs and industries of the 21st century will be...

00:41.875 --> 00:44.310
...centered around clean, renewable energy.

00:44.975 --> 00:49.285
The only question is which country will create these jobs and these industries.

00:49.790 --> 00:52.950
Experts say China may be positioning to take the lead,...

00:53.120 --> 00:54.825
...and not just in wind energy.

00:55.185 --> 00:58.755
The country now has the largest solar power manufacturing industry,...

00:59.025 --> 01:03.030
...with the government recently approving a plan to build the largest solar field on Earth,...

01:03.270 --> 01:05.130
...65 square kilometers,...

01:05.330 --> 01:08.700
...generating enough energy to light three million homes.
