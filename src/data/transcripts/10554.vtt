00:00.200 --> 00:03.100
In fact, the insurance industry is rolling out the big guns...

00:03.300 --> 00:05.500
...and breaking out their massive war chest...

00:05.800 --> 00:09.600
...to marshal their forces for one last fight to save the status quo.

00:10.150 --> 00:13.000
They're filling the airwaves with deceptive and dishonest ads.

00:13.300 --> 00:16.600
They're flooding Capitol Hill with lobbyists and campaign contributions.

00:16.900 --> 00:20.400
And they're funding studies designed to mislead the American people.

00:21.300 --> 00:25.200
Of course, like clockwork, we've seen folks on cable television who know better,...

00:25.450 --> 00:27.850
...waving these industry-funded studies in the air.

00:28.300 --> 00:30.900
We've seen industry insiders and their apologists...

00:31.100 --> 00:34.450
...citing these studies as proof of claims that just aren't true.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.200
They'll claim that premiums will go up under reform.

00:37.450 --> 00:40.550
But they know that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office...

00:40.750 --> 00:44.550
...found that reforms will lower premiums in a new insurance exchange,...

00:44.650 --> 00:48.350
...while offering consumers protections that will limit out-of-pocket costs...

00:48.400 --> 00:51.100
...and prevent discrimination based on pre-existing conditions.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.900
They'll claim that you'll have to pay more out-of-pocket.

00:54.150 --> 00:59.100
But they know that this is based on a study that willfully ignores whole sections of the bill...

00:59.300 --> 01:04.100
...including tax credits and cost savings that will greatly benefit middle class families.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.500
Even the authors of one of these studies have now admitted publicly...

01:07.750 --> 01:12.000
...that the insurance companies actually asked them to do an incomplete job.

01:12.600 --> 01:13.800
It's smoke and mirrors.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.400
It's bogus and it's all too familiar.

01:16.950 --> 01:19.100
Every time we get close to passing reform,...

01:19.300 --> 01:23.450
...the insurance companies produce these phony studies as a prescription and say,...

01:23.500 --> 01:25.350
..."Take one of these and call us in a decade."

01:26.000 --> 01:27.700
Well, not this time.
