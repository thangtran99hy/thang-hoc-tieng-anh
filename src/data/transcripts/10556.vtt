00:00.850 --> 00:03.900
I have been in office for just nine months.

00:04.650 --> 00:06.800
Though some days, it seems a lot longer.

00:09.200 --> 00:17.100
I am well aware of the expectations that accompany my presidency around the world...

00:18.300 --> 00:20.400
...and these expectations are not about me.

00:21.800 --> 00:26.400
Rather they are rooted, I believe, in a discontent with the status quo...

00:27.150 --> 00:30.800
...that has allowed us to be increasingly defined by our differences...

00:31.800 --> 00:33.950
...and outpaced by our problems.

00:35.450 --> 00:37.250
But they are also rooted in hope.

00:38.900 --> 00:41.200
The hope that real change is possible...

00:42.200 --> 00:46.800
...and the hope that America will be a leader in bringing about such change.

00:48.850 --> 00:55.500
I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust.

00:56.750 --> 01:01.200
A part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country.

01:02.650 --> 01:05.750
Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies...

01:06.400 --> 01:12.000
...and a belief that on certain critical issues, America had acted unilaterally,...

01:12.550 --> 01:15.000
...without regard for the interests of others.

01:16.050 --> 01:20.200
And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism,...

01:21.000 --> 01:26.100
...which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction.

01:27.750 --> 01:33.500
Now, like all of you, my responsibility is to act in the interests of my nation and my people...

01:34.100 --> 01:37.400
...and I will never apologize for defending those interests.

01:38.550 --> 01:44.300
But it is my deeply held belief that in the year 2009...

01:45.200 --> 01:47.950
...more than at any point in human history,...

01:48.900 --> 01:52.400
...the interests of nations and peoples are shared.

01:53.600 --> 01:56.600
The religious convictions that we hold in our hearts...

01:57.350 --> 02:01.000
...can forge new bonds among people or they can tear us apart.

02:02.550 --> 02:07.450
The technology we harness can light the path to peace or forever darken it.

02:08.850 --> 02:12.250
The energy we use can sustain our planet or destroy it.

02:13.400 --> 02:17.600
What happens to the hope of a single child anywhere...

02:19.000 --> 02:21.950
...can enrich our world or impoverish it.
