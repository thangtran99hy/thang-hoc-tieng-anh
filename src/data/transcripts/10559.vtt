00:01.600 --> 00:07.000
But the problem that plagues the health care system is not just a problem for the uninsured.

00:08.400 --> 00:13.400
Those who do have insurance have never had less security and stability than they do today.

00:14.800 --> 00:19.350
More and more Americans worry that if you move, lose your job or change your job,...

00:19.700 --> 00:21.100
...you'll lose your health insurance too.

00:22.350 --> 00:24.250
More and more Americans pay their premiums...

00:24.350 --> 00:28.700
...only to discover that their insurance company has dropped their coverage when they get sick...

00:29.600 --> 00:31.100
...or won't pay the full cost of care.

00:31.150 --> 00:32.400
It happens every day.

00:34.150 --> 00:37.600
One man from Illinois lost his coverage in the middle of chemotherapy...

00:37.700 --> 00:42.300
...because his insurer found that he hadn't reported gallstones that he didn't even know about.

00:43.500 --> 00:44.550
They delayed his treatment...

00:45.200 --> 00:46.300
...and he died because of it.

00:47.700 --> 00:51.150
Another woman from Texas was about to get a double mastectomy...

00:51.750 --> 00:56.400
...when her insurance company canceled her policy because she forgot to declare a case of acne.

00:57.150 --> 00:59.400
By the time she had her insurance reinstated,...

00:59.850 --> 01:02.950
...her breast cancer had more than doubled in size.

01:04.450 --> 01:05.700
That is heartbreaking.

01:05.800 --> 01:06.600
It is wrong...

01:06.700 --> 01:09.500
...and no one should be treated that way in the United States of America.
