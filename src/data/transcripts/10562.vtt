00:00.850 --> 00:03.950
Where you are right now doesn't have to determine where you'll end up.

00:04.900 --> 00:06.750
No one's written your destiny for you...

00:07.100 --> 00:09.800
...because here in America, you write your own destiny.

00:10.150 --> 00:11.400
You make your own future.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.100
That's what young people like you are doing every day, all across America.

00:18.400 --> 00:21.800
Young people like Jazmin Perez, from Roma, Texas.

00:22.350 --> 00:25.500
Jazmin didn't speak English when she first started school.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.900
Neither of her parents had gone to college.

00:28.400 --> 00:32.650
But she worked hard, earned good grades and got a scholarship to Brown University.

00:33.300 --> 00:39.550
Now in graduate school, studying public health. On her way to becoming Dr. Jazmin Perez.

00:40.900 --> 00:45.400
I'm thinking about Andoni Schultz, from Los Altos, California,...

00:45.850 --> 00:48.650
...who's fought brain cancer since he was three.

00:50.150 --> 00:53.150
He's had to endure all sorts of treatments and surgeries.

00:53.550 --> 00:56.900
One of which affected his memory, so it took him much longer,...

00:57.100 --> 00:59.300
...hundreds of extra hours, to do his schoolwork.

01:00.650 --> 01:02.050
But he never fell behind.

01:02.950 --> 01:04.400
He's headed to college this fall.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.400
And then there's Shantell Steve, from my hometown of Chicago, Illinois.

01:10.500 --> 01:15.700
Even when bouncing from foster home to foster home in the toughest neighborhoods in the city,...

01:15.900 --> 01:18.900
...she managed to get a job at a local health care center,...

01:19.450 --> 01:22.300
...start a program to keep young people out of gangs...

01:22.400 --> 01:25.900
...and she's on track to graduate high school with honors, and go on to college.

01:27.300 --> 01:33.050
And Jazmin, Andoni, and Shantell aren't any different from any of you.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.700
They face challenges in their lives just like you do.

01:37.450 --> 01:41.100
In some cases, they've got it a lot worse off than many of you.

01:42.450 --> 01:43.700
But they refused to give up.

01:44.750 --> 01:47.700
They chose to take responsibility for their lives,...

01:48.000 --> 01:49.100
...for their education...

01:49.300 --> 01:50.600
...and set goals for themselves.

01:50.650 --> 01:52.500
And I expect all of you to do the same.
