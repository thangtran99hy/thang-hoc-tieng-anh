00:00.461 --> 00:03.882
There are so many letters like that, that I'm receiving every day.

00:05.415 --> 00:06.246
Yeah. Here's another one.

00:07.467 --> 00:13.101
A woman whose husband retired from AT&T at 61 is waiting to get on Medicare.

00:14.759 --> 00:18.191
You now have the company in negotiations with the union and...

00:18.615 --> 00:22.017
...may decide to stop health care for retirees.

00:24.031 --> 00:26.789
Got another one, an antique business in Alabama.

00:28.283 --> 00:31.174
They are on the verge of losing their business...

00:32.328 --> 00:35.515
...because they just can't afford to pay the premiums.

00:36.815 --> 00:39.761
Their premiums increased 70 dollars per month, just this month.

00:41.441 --> 00:44.882
So, a lot of the stories are heartbreaking.

00:45.923 --> 00:47.219
People who work hard,...

00:48.312 --> 00:51.055
...a lot of times they'll say: "I've never written to a president before."

00:51.607 --> 00:52.907
"I'm not looking for a handout."

00:54.115 --> 00:56.151
"All I want is just a fair shake."

00:56.382 --> 00:59.984
And it ends up being a powerful motivator for me when...

01:00.488 --> 01:03.647
...we try to move this health agenda forward.

01:04.518 --> 01:06.159
Now, some of them are more cheerful...

01:06.777 --> 01:08.683
...and you have this one for example.

01:09.559 --> 01:11.831
With all the huge money difficulties facing our country,...

01:11.899 --> 01:14.109
...I thought you might like to see how someone spent their...

01:14.534 --> 01:18.144
...250-dollar stimulus money.

01:18.925 --> 01:21.800
Thank you for all the pleasures from tending my raised bed...

01:21.865 --> 01:23.475
...and from the vegetables I hope to enjoy.

01:23.583 --> 01:26.379
So she set up a vegetable garden...

01:26.741 --> 01:27.669
...and she sent me a picture.

01:30.110 --> 01:34.123
There's a beautiful letter that I got just a couple of days ago. I'm gonna be responding.

01:35.201 --> 01:36.282
From a woman who...

01:37.253 --> 01:41.130
...had found a letter and she forwarded it to me.

01:42.239 --> 01:43.553
A letter from her father...

01:44.431 --> 01:46.394
...when he was fighting in World War II.

01:47.837 --> 01:51.283
She had just been born and he had just gotten news of her birth...

01:51.656 --> 01:53.721
...and he sent this letter. "My dearest daughter."

01:54.495 --> 01:56.946
And explained what he was doing...

01:58.149 --> 02:01.582
...in Europe during World War II and why this was so important,...

02:01.705 --> 02:03.827
...and what the country meant to him.

02:04.317 --> 02:08.459
And that someday, she'd be old enough to read it, and understand why this was so important.

02:09.265 --> 02:13.343
You know, you get letters like that and it gives you a sense of what's best about America,...

02:13.519 --> 02:15.635
...and inspires you,...

02:16.051 --> 02:18.833
...and makes you wanna work that much harder to make sure that...

02:19.727 --> 02:23.524
...that spirit is reflected in our government.
