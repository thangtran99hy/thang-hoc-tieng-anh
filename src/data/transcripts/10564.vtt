00:01.400 --> 00:05.550
Mr. Secretary-General, Excellencies,...

00:06.300 --> 00:10.500
...distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen.

00:11.350 --> 00:16.500
It is my great pleasure to address this timely meeting...

00:16.700 --> 00:20.150
...of the United Nations Summit on Climate Change.

00:20.850 --> 00:26.400
I was appointed as Prime Minister of Japan six days ago...

00:27.200 --> 00:34.400
...in a historic change of government achieved through the will of the people at the recent elections.

00:38.350 --> 00:39.850
Mr. Secretary-General,...

00:40.600 --> 00:43.950
...climate change affects the entire globe...

00:44.400 --> 00:48.500
...and requires long-term and international efforts.

00:49.250 --> 00:55.300
Thus, it is imperative for all countries to address the issue...

00:55.750 --> 01:01.400
...under the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.

01:02.250 --> 01:03.800
With the change of government,...

01:04.400 --> 01:06.600
...as Prime Minister of Japan,...

01:07.150 --> 01:10.300
...I will now seek to unite our efforts...

01:11.000 --> 01:14.800
...to address current and future global climate change,...

01:15.350 --> 01:20.600
...with due consideration of the warnings of science.
