Hello, everybody! That's Malia...

00:04.900 --> 00:06.605
...our technical advisor.

00:08.405 --> 00:10.610
It is wonderful to see all of you today.

00:11.285 --> 00:15.080
Welcome! I hope everybody had a wonderful Easter.

00:15.990 --> 00:21.020
This is one of the greatest White House traditions because it,...

00:21.385 --> 00:23.990
...it reminds us that this is the people's house.

00:24.200 --> 00:27.425
And to see so many children out here...

00:28.060 --> 00:29.295
...having a great time...

00:30.095 --> 00:35.905
...just fills Michelle and myself, and the entire family with a whole lot of joy.

00:36.170 --> 00:40.205
So, I'm not really in charge here today.

00:40.340 --> 00:41.840
My sole job,...

00:42.505 --> 00:47.415
...in addition to thanking Fergie for that wonderful rendition of our national anthem, and...

00:47.680 --> 00:50.450
...thanking my buddy the Easter Bunny for being here,...

00:50.945 --> 00:52.250
...is to introduce...

00:53.585 --> 00:58.025
...my First Lady, your First Lady, Michelle Obama.

01:04.130 --> 01:05.665
Alright! Okay, it's working.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.765
Welcome, everybody.

01:07.935 --> 01:13.205
I have... I don't have much to say. I want to welcome you all to the 2009 White House...

01:13.470 --> 01:16.075
...Easter Egg Hunt. Yay!

01:18.975 --> 01:21.355
Our goal today is just to have fun.

01:21.985 --> 01:24.950
We want to focus on activity, healthy eating.

01:25.150 --> 01:29.555
We've got yoga. We've got dancing. We've got storytelling. We've got...

01:29.755 --> 01:33.060
...Easter egg decorating. Oh! We've got basketball.

01:34.260 --> 01:39.665
A little soccer, as well. And we want everybody to think about moving their bodies,...

01:39.895 --> 01:43.270
...get out. We don't have tennis. It's on the tennis court,...

01:44.905 --> 01:46.540
...the peanut gallery back here.

01:47.105 --> 01:51.210
So, the goal today is to have fun, to get out and play.

01:52.175 --> 01:56.915
And let's get things started with the Easter Egg Roll. Thank you all for coming today.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.715
Have fun. Thanks so much.
