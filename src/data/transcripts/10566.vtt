Japan deems the following four principles essential in assisting developing countries:

00:09.100 --> 00:14.000
First, the developed countries including Japan...

00:14.450 --> 00:23.800
...must contribute through substantial, new and additional, public and private financing.

00:25.100 --> 00:32.100
Second, we must develop rules that will facilitate international recognition...

00:32.650 --> 00:35.850
...of developing countries' emission reductions.

00:36.400 --> 00:41.350
In particular, those achieved through financial assistance...

00:41.950 --> 00:46.600
...in a measurable, reportable and verifiable manner.

00:47.750 --> 00:52.250
Third, on assistance to developing countries,...

00:52.850 --> 01:01.100
...consideration should be given to innovative mechanisms to be implemented in a predictable manner.

01:02.100 --> 01:06.300
And an international system should be established...

01:06.700 --> 01:10.300
...under the auspices of the UN Climate Change Regime.

01:11.300 --> 01:18.400
This system should facilitate one-stop provision of information on...

01:18.650 --> 01:24.400
...and matching of available bilateral and multilateral financing,...

01:24.950 --> 01:31.850
...while securing transparency and effective utilization of assistance.

01:32.950 --> 01:41.400
Fourth, Japan proposes to establish a framework to promote the transfer of low carbon technologies...

01:41.950 --> 01:46.650
...which ensures the protection of intellectual property rights.
