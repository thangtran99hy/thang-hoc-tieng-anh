00:00.100 --> 00:04.035
Well, welcome to the White House as we kick off the Music Series:...

00:04.305 --> 00:09.475
...The Jazz Studio. How has it been for you all? It's been good? Is it good, yeah?

00:10.975 --> 00:15.015
Well, I wanna just thank a few people. I wanna thank Jazz at Lincoln Center,...

00:15.480 --> 00:21.655
...the Thelonious Monk Jazz Institute, and the Duke Ellington Jazz Festival for making today possible...

00:21.960 --> 00:25.625
...and for keeping jazz alive. So, let's give everyone a round of applause.

00:31.465 --> 00:35.100
Today's event exemplifies what I think the White House,...

00:35.153 --> 00:37.433
...the people's house, should be about.

00:38.005 --> 00:40.940
This is a place to honor America's past,...

00:41.240 --> 00:44.510
...celebrate its present, and create its future.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.645
And that's why all of you all are here today. It's about you, the future.

00:48.215 --> 00:54.925
And what better example of this is than jazz, America's indigenous art form.

00:55.585 --> 01:00.760
Globally recognized as America's music, originating in the great city of New Orleans...

01:01.160 --> 01:04.830
...just a century ago through the African-American experience.

01:05.160 --> 01:09.764
Today, jazz is performed and listened to by people of all ethnicities,...

01:09.796 --> 01:12.066
...backgrounds, ages, and creeds.

01:12.600 --> 01:18.475
Indeed, jazz is considered by many to be America's greatest artistic gift to the world.

01:19.475 --> 01:22.180
The understanding and appreciation of jazz...

01:22.305 --> 01:26.820
...is integral to understanding and appreciating American history and culture.

01:27.450 --> 01:33.625
It's an outstanding artistic model of individual expression and democratic expression, as well.

01:34.495 --> 01:39.595
And there's probably no better example of democracy than a jazz ensemble:...

01:40.800 --> 01:44.535
...individual freedom but with responsibility to the group.

01:45.500 --> 01:48.605
It's essential that we preserve, develop, and expand...

01:48.705 --> 01:51.845
...this treasured art form for our future generations...

01:52.145 --> 01:54.270
...by recognizing and elevating...

01:54.415 --> 01:59.820
...the importance of our jazz education programs in every single school across America.

02:01.085 --> 02:06.493
The budding jazz, young jazz musicians from across the country...

02:06.795 --> 02:12.065
...who are with us today, all you young talents are the future guardians of the music.

02:12.985 --> 02:15.165
We salute you and your teachers.

02:15.600 --> 02:20.340
We are counting on you to keep the music vital and evolving for generations to come.

02:21.840 --> 02:27.033
And as jazz has been demonstrating, every night for more than a hundred years,...

02:27.097 --> 02:29.666
...when we work together there's nothing that we can't do.

02:30.350 --> 02:32.185
So, I'm through talking.

02:32.690 --> 02:35.220
Now, we get to the fun part. We can hear some music.

02:35.455 --> 02:37.955
So, I hope you guys enjoy your time here together.

02:38.625 --> 02:41.050
I hope you get to see some of this White House.

02:41.195 --> 02:44.130
I heard a few of you were skipping on your way up to the White House.

02:44.300 --> 02:46.665
I hope you keep skipping and having fun here.

02:46.865 --> 02:50.205
I brought my own family with me today 'cause I wanna keep them...

02:51.605 --> 02:55.305
...alive and aware of all kinds of music other than hip-hop.

02:58.510 --> 03:02.630
So, it's so important for me to have you here that I brought them here as well.

03:02.845 --> 03:06.120
And jazz has been a part of my life since I was a little girl.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.755
My mother's father who we called "South Side".

03:11.790 --> 03:16.820
Before there were room to room speakers, he had a speaker in every house,...

03:17.030 --> 03:20.630
...every room in his house and he played it 24 hours a day...

03:21.500 --> 03:24.405
...at the highest volume he could put it on.

03:25.105 --> 03:27.385
And that's how I grew up in my household.

03:27.940 --> 03:33.480
At Christmas, birthdays, Easter, it didn't matter. There was jazz playing in our household.

03:33.815 --> 03:39.215
So, it means so much to me to be able to bring that music here to the White House...

03:39.585 --> 03:41.520
...and to have you all celebrating with us.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.890
So, have a good time. Thanks so much.
