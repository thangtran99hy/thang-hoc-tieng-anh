00:00.500 --> 00:05.500
I would like to propose to the international community a Hatoyama Initiative...

00:05.950 --> 00:09.150
...based on what I have just outlined.

00:09.900 --> 00:14.150
The Kyoto Protocol was a historic milestone...

00:14.600 --> 00:23.450
...as the first international framework that obligated nations to reduce greenhouse gases.

00:24.350 --> 00:31.900
Effective efforts however, cannot be realized unless a new framework is created.

00:32.650 --> 00:39.300
To that end, towards establishing a fair and effective new single undertaking,...

00:39.900 --> 00:45.900
...I will exert every effort for the success of Copenhagen,...

00:46.250 --> 00:49.550
...in the course of formulating this initiative.

00:50.450 --> 00:52.450
Mr. Secretary-General,...

00:53.550 --> 00:57.050
...active measures to address climate change...

00:57.450 --> 01:02.050
...such as the Green New Deal initiated by President Obama...

01:02.700 --> 01:10.850
...will open new frontiers and create new opportunities for employment in the world economy.

01:11.350 --> 01:16.600
Particularly, in such fields as clean energy technologies,...

01:16.950 --> 01:22.100
...including electric vehicles and solar power generation.

01:22.900 --> 01:28.800
Japan has relatively strong potential for technological development...

01:29.250 --> 01:33.200
...as well as considerable financial capacity.

01:33.700 --> 01:41.800
Thus, I recognize that Japan is expected to take the lead in the international community...

01:42.250 --> 01:45.000
...in setting its own reduction target...

01:45.550 --> 01:51.900
...and to achieve such target through the development of innovative technologies.

01:52.800 --> 01:58.500
I have full confidence in the abilities of the Japanese people and our companies.

01:59.215 --> 02:05.550
Political leaders at this time also have a responsibility to future generations...

02:05.800 --> 02:12.450
...to create a sustainable society by transforming the social structure...

02:12.950 --> 02:18.200
...that we have known since the Industrial Revolution.

02:19.350 --> 02:28.150
Mr. Secretary-General, in conclusion, I wish to make a strong appeal to you to work together,...

02:28.600 --> 02:36.000
...so that we will be able to make significant achievements in Copenhagen in December.

02:36.500 --> 02:40.300
And that the people of the world will be able to say...

02:40.700 --> 02:48.000
...that their leaders made crucial decisions for the sake of future generations.

02:48.550 --> 02:49.900
Thank you very much.
