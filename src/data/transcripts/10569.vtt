00:00.600 --> 00:04.800
The new Japanese government has set a very ambitious target...

00:05.300 --> 00:12.600
...for a greenhouse gas emissions reduction of 25% by 2020,...

00:13.200 --> 00:17.000
...if compared to the 1990 level.

00:17.700 --> 00:25.350
It has also made it clear that it is prepared to provide more financial and technical assistance...

00:25.700 --> 00:28.850
...to developing countries than in the past,...

00:29.350 --> 00:33.700
...in accordance with the progress of the international negotiations.

00:34.500 --> 00:43.100
This international commitment is premised on the formulation of a fair and effective international framework...

00:43.500 --> 00:50.000
...by all major economies and agreement on their ambitious targets.

00:50.850 --> 00:59.050
Japan announced this ambitious pledge because it wishes to serve as a bridge among countries...

00:59.400 --> 01:06.700
...with varied interests and to preserve the planet for future generations.

01:07.450 --> 01:13.600
I would like to appeal strongly to the distinguished representatives present today.

01:14.350 --> 01:20.600
Let us work together to ensure the success of the upcoming Copenhagen meeting.

01:22.100 --> 01:28.100
The third challenge is that of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.

01:29.050 --> 01:35.900
I welcome the progress being made in the negotiations on nuclear weapons reductions...

01:36.200 --> 01:39.500
...between the United States and the Russian Federation.

01:40.200 --> 01:45.250
I also commend the United Kingdom and France for their initiatives.

01:46.450 --> 01:54.800
It is urgent that all nuclear weapon holding states take concrete measures on nuclear disarmament.

01:55.700 --> 02:01.500
There are states currently engaged in efforts to develop nuclear weapons.

02:01.900 --> 02:09.550
Furthermore, there is an increasingly greater risk that nuclear materials and nuclear technologies...

02:09.850 --> 02:15.000
...will be passed on to terrorists or even actually used.
