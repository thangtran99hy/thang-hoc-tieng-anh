00:00.600 --> 00:03.650
On August 6th and 9th this year,...

00:03.950 --> 00:06.350
...I visited Hiroshima and Nagasaki,...

00:06.650 --> 00:10.250
...and spoke in person with atomic bomb survivors...

00:10.500 --> 00:13.600
...and their second- and third-generation descendants.

00:14.150 --> 00:17.500
I could not help feeling choked with emotion...

00:17.550 --> 00:23.500
...at the fact that just two atomic bombs claimed more than 200 thousand lives...

00:23.900 --> 00:32.450
...and seeing people who still suffer from the aftereffects of radiation over 60 years after the bombings.

00:33.100 --> 00:38.950
I would like to encourage all leaders of the world to visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki...

00:39.300 --> 00:45.850
...and absorb with their own eyes and ears the cruelty of nuclear weapons.

00:46.650 --> 00:49.000
As a matter of historical fact,...

00:49.400 --> 00:56.150
...Japan chose not to possess nuclear weapons even after achieving its postwar reconstruction.

00:56.700 --> 01:03.500
In 1970, Japan signed the NPT and ratified it six years later.

01:04.150 --> 01:11.300
In 1996, Japan signed the CTBT and ratified it a year later.
