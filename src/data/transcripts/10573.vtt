00:01.000 --> 00:03.900
The garden was something that I had always thought about.

00:04.400 --> 00:10.050
I was probably like most busy mothers who were, you know, a busy working family.

00:10.550 --> 00:16.100
And I would find it difficult to feed my family in a healthy way quickly,...

00:17.000 --> 00:19.100
...so I decided to change our diet.

00:19.400 --> 00:23.100
And this happened throughout the course of the campaign, and it was really simple things:...

00:23.150 --> 00:25.000
...Adding more fruits and vegetables,...

00:25.200 --> 00:30.000
...trying to sit down as a family and prepare a meal a couple of times a week,...

00:30.300 --> 00:31.800
...eating out a little bit less,...

00:32.225 --> 00:36.900
...eliminating processed and sugary foods as much as possible.

00:36.950 --> 00:41.900
And I saw some really immediate results with just those minor changes.

00:42.200 --> 00:46.650
And I thought... well, if I could help other families,...

00:46.700 --> 00:50.600
...kind of learn these small changes in my role as First Lady,...

00:50.650 --> 00:52.200
...that would be a good thing.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.700
Today, we are amending our soil...

00:58.900 --> 01:01.900
...and we've gotten our soil tested, it's actually in really good shape.

01:02.850 --> 01:07.700
So, what we're gonna do is add a few amendments to increase the fertility of the soil.

01:07.900 --> 01:10.150
To sort of provide a lot of stability for the soil...

01:10.750 --> 01:12.100
...and bring it into balance.

01:13.800 --> 01:17.400
Basically, setting the foundation that we'll build on for years and years to come.

01:24.950 --> 01:26.200
We're doing our first till.

01:26.450 --> 01:30.500
We're churning over the soil about... we're going down six-to-eight inches deep...

01:30.950 --> 01:32.700
...and then, we're gonna spread some amendments.

01:40.250 --> 01:44.700
We're gonna use some sulfate to potash which basically adds some sulfur.

01:45.150 --> 01:52.500
We have crab meal which is gonna add our calcium and nitrogen, which is absolutely critical.

01:53.050 --> 01:58.250
And our crabs are sourced from the Chesapeake, so we're all keeping it in the region.

02:00.850 --> 02:02.050
Guess what that means:...

02:02.800 --> 02:04.850
...No work, no spuds.

02:05.350 --> 02:11.300
No work, no turnip, no tank, no flying fortress, no victory.

02:11.850 --> 02:16.350
Bear that in mind all you victory gardeners and work for victory!

02:18.300 --> 02:22.750
This is the first vegetable garden since Eleanor Roosevelt's victory garden in World War II.

02:23.300 --> 02:28.300
When we look back at the records it was actually a really tough time getting it established.

02:28.550 --> 02:30.500
And in the end, it was a plot,...

02:30.600 --> 02:33.800
...you know, probably about the size of one bed that we have here,...

02:33.850 --> 02:37.050
...that one of the daughters of somebody who worked here tended to.

02:37.550 --> 02:44.200
So, as a sort of really productive, you know, feeding a lot of people garden,...

02:44.600 --> 02:46.450
...this is the first one in well over a hundred years.
