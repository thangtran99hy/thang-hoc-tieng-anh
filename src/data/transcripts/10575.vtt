00:00.700 --> 00:07.350
To Heather and all the others who have made this evening possible, thank you so much.

00:08.050 --> 00:09.350
It is wonderful to be here.

00:09.400 --> 00:14.150
I wanna express my appreciation for the opportunity...

00:14.200 --> 00:19.100
...to tell jokes that weren't funny enough for me to use when we did this five weeks ago.

00:25.100 --> 00:25.600
Whatever.

00:28.550 --> 00:32.900
The jokes may not be as good but neither is the guest list.

00:40.350 --> 00:43.450
I'm just joking; For me, there's no contest.

00:44.950 --> 00:50.400
Why bother hanging out with celebrities when I can spend time with the people who made me one?

00:54.150 --> 00:55.750
I know where my bread is buttered.

00:57.350 --> 01:00.800
Plus, we have our own luminaries here in attendance.

01:01.400 --> 01:04.450
The junior senator from Wyoming, John Barrasso is here.

01:10.750 --> 01:13.550
I'm sorry, John Barrasso skipped this evening.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.600
Let me tell you, though, for those who haven't met him,...

01:17.700 --> 01:21.700
...John Barrasso is the George Clooney of junior senators from Wyoming.

01:28.350 --> 01:33.850
It is great to be here with so much talent from the world of TV and radio.

01:34.817 --> 01:36.347
Despite the flood of new media,...

01:37.073 --> 01:40.769
...I think your programming is more relevant than ever before.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.700
At least, that's the impression I get when I read the blogs every day.

01:49.500 --> 01:52.500
It's good to see a number of hardworking correspondents here tonight.

01:53.250 --> 01:56.450
Journalists like Chuck Todd. I think I spotted Chuck over there somewhere.

01:58.750 --> 02:02.600
At this dinner, Chuck embodies the best of both worlds.

02:02.900 --> 02:06.650
He has the rapid-fire style of a television correspondent...

02:06.700 --> 02:09.700
...and the facial hair of a radio correspondent.

02:17.200 --> 02:20.050
Mika Brzezinski is here, I believe, in the house.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.100
Mika and I have a lot in common.

02:22.160 --> 02:26.700
We both have partners named Joe who used to be in Congress and don't know when to stop talking.

02:33.850 --> 02:36.750
And happening now: Wolf Blitzer is here.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.350
He's the only man...

02:40.650 --> 02:43.450
...the only other man in America with his own Situation Room.

02:46.150 --> 02:48.000
People assume that mine is cooler...

02:48.800 --> 02:50.500
...but this is not the case.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.400
As hard as we've tried,...

02:52.450 --> 02:58.350
...we have not been able to generate the bandwidth necessary to turn Larry Summers into a hologram.

03:01.950 --> 03:02.750
We can't do it.

03:05.400 --> 03:10.950
Now, one person that you know could not be here tonight is Secretary Hillary Clinton.

03:12.193 --> 03:12.965
As most of you know,...

03:13.083 --> 03:16.656
...Hillary broke her elbow a few days ago on her way to the White House.

03:16.850 --> 03:18.800
And we all wish her a very speedy recovery.

03:19.050 --> 03:22.900
I do have to say, though, that while it's been reported as an accident,...

03:23.250 --> 03:26.400
...there were some suspicious circumstances.

03:27.533 --> 03:28.633
Just before the incident,...

03:28.737 --> 03:34.384
...Secret Service spotted Richard Holbrooke spraying WD-40 all over the driveway.

03:40.700 --> 03:45.050
So now, on top of the costs of health care and energy, and the recovery plan,...

03:45.800 --> 03:47.550
...we've got another fiscal problem.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.650
Fortunately, the lawyers tell me that Hillary is ready to settle.

03:55.273 --> 03:56.093
I have to admit, though,...

03:56.507 --> 04:00.079
...it wasn't easy coming up with fresh material for this dinner.

04:00.530 --> 04:03.045
A few nights ago, I was up tossing and turning,...

04:03.151 --> 04:04.901
...trying to figure out exactly what to say.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.793
Finally, when I couldn't get back to sleep,...

04:07.871 --> 04:10.707
...I rolled over and asked Brian Williams what he thought.

04:23.350 --> 04:27.400
Now, the truth is, Brian Williams is actually a terrible houseguest.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.100
He put an empty milk carton back in the fridge.

04:32.050 --> 04:34.400
He leaves his wet towels all over the Roosevelt Room.

04:35.800 --> 04:38.350
We're pretty sure he clogged the toilet and didn't tell anybody.
