00:00.950 --> 00:04.000
Almost two years ago, he was with me for most of the campaign.

00:04.050 --> 00:05.200
He is a great friend of mine...

00:05.900 --> 00:07.000
...and there he is back there.

00:07.550 --> 00:09.800
So, that's Marcus' pop right here.

00:10.300 --> 00:13.100
We always tried to figure out how Marcus got so big...

00:16.450 --> 00:20.100
...'cause Jeff is not that big and his wife is even smaller.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.250
Y'all people forget now,...

00:24.550 --> 00:29.600
...but this team was not ranked number one until the end of the season.

00:30.100 --> 00:34.550
That's perseverance, and that's thanks to the tone the coach sets.

00:34.850 --> 00:39.400
He trains these guys for competitive excellence, as he calls it. On and off the field.

00:40.200 --> 00:44.400
And in sports, as in life, your number may be called just once...

00:44.550 --> 00:45.700
Oh, whose phone is that?

00:46.500 --> 00:49.000
Is that one of the player's phones? 'Fess up.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.250
All right.

01:00.750 --> 01:04.200
Coach is gonna talk to you after... about not turning off your phone.

01:06.400 --> 01:10.650
In sports, as in life, I was gonna say your number may just be called once...

01:10.700 --> 01:11.900
...but I didn't mean it literally.

01:13.850 --> 01:17.100
And coach makes sure that you're... they're ready when that happens.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.500
I understand that a lot of times reporters ask Coach Meyer,...

01:22.750 --> 01:25.150
..."What did you say to the team at halftime?"

01:26.500 --> 01:28.950
But what I've heard is he doesn't usually have to say too much...

01:29.000 --> 01:32.650
...because the leaders of this team step up and say what needs to be said.

01:32.700 --> 01:38.950
So, there are guys like Percy and Brandon, and Louis Murphy, and...

01:39.950 --> 01:44.450
...I understand there are a couple of comedians here, the 300-pound Pouncey Twins.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.300
Where are they? Right there?

01:51.300 --> 01:51.900
All right.

01:53.800 --> 01:57.800
And then of course there's the quarterback, where's Tebow at?

01:58.650 --> 01:59.500
There he is, over there.

02:00.150 --> 02:01.200
Heisman Trophy winner.

02:01.600 --> 02:02.600
That's what I'm talking about.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.900
Everybody is gonna get a handshake afterwards, just relax.

02:14.075 --> 02:16.600
Tim's an inspiration to so many.

02:17.350 --> 02:22.500
A guy whose true strength comes not from the gym, but from his faith.

02:23.050 --> 02:27.500
He says he puts faith, family, and academics above football.
