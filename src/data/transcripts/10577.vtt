00:00.200 --> 00:05.905
Windows that generate electricity by directing light to solar cells.

00:06.605 --> 00:10.410
Lightweight, high-powered batteries that aren't built but are grown.

00:11.210 --> 00:12.345
That was neat stuff.

00:14.545 --> 00:19.585
Engineering viruses to create batteries.

00:20.985 --> 00:24.725
More efficient lighting systems that rely on nanotechnology.

00:25.325 --> 00:30.865
Innovative engineering that will make it possible for offshore wind power plants to deliver electricity...

00:31.260 --> 00:33.065
...even when the air is still.

00:34.335 --> 00:39.875
And it's a reminder that all of you are heirs to a legacy of innovation,...

00:40.470 --> 00:42.275
...not just here but across America.

00:42.610 --> 00:46.910
Countries on every corner of this Earth now recognize that energy supplies...

00:47.480 --> 00:48.545
...are growing scarcer.

00:49.045 --> 00:52.985
Energy demands are growing larger, and rising energy use...

00:53.350 --> 00:56.655
...imperils the planet we will leave to future generations.

00:57.725 --> 01:01.260
That's why the world is now engaged in a peaceful competition...

01:01.725 --> 01:04.895
...to determine the technologies that will power the 21st century.

01:05.530 --> 01:08.205
From China to India, from Japan to Germany,...

01:08.465 --> 01:12.975
...nations everywhere are racing to develop new ways to produce and use energy.

01:14.005 --> 01:18.410
The nation that wins this competition will be the nation that leads the global economy.

01:18.745 --> 01:19.780
I am convinced of that...

01:20.180 --> 01:23.285
...and I want America to be that nation. It's that simple.
