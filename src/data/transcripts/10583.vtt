00:00.900 --> 00:04.300
And I asked, I guess Mariano Jr.,...

00:04.950 --> 00:09.700
...I said, "Has your dad taught you that cut fastball?"

00:09.750 --> 00:12.300
And he said, "Yeah, I'm getting it. I'm getting it."

00:12.550 --> 00:15.500
So, you know, we may have to keep an eye on that kid.

00:16.300 --> 00:17.550
And then I talked to Ichiro.

00:18.350 --> 00:23.300
And I said "Now, how exactly do you throw that ball from..."

00:23.850 --> 00:26.800
...in the outfield to home plate like a laser?"

00:26.950 --> 00:27.400
Right.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.300
And he said, "Soft muscle." Soft muscle.

00:31.600 --> 00:32.950
He said, "You don't need to be big."

00:34.450 --> 00:36.100
It's a very zen like answer.

00:36.450 --> 00:37.625
He's a very zen-like guy.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
He's an impressive guy.

00:39.150 --> 00:43.050
Prince Fielder of the Brewers who won the Home Run Derby last night says,...

00:43.350 --> 00:47.300
..."Do you ever get to just be by yourself, watch a little TV..."

00:47.350 --> 00:50.400
...and I'm quoting him here,"... and not talk to nobody?"

00:52.400 --> 00:57.150
I do actually, and that's my most precious time...

00:57.750 --> 00:59.450
...other than spending time with the girls.

00:59.700 --> 01:00.900
But usually they go to bed,...

01:01.000 --> 01:02.200
...Michelle goes to bed early.

01:02.450 --> 01:03.800
She goes to bed about 9:30.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.350
The girls go to bed about 9:00.

01:06.850 --> 01:09.800
And that's when, after I've done the reading,...

01:10.300 --> 01:15.000
...SportsCenter, that's when you break out. And if you can catch a ball game,...

01:15.500 --> 01:20.400
...open a beer, put your feet up and be quiet for a while, nothing beats that.

01:20.600 --> 01:25.050
Now, we all love SportsCenter, but you got to make sure they get the new MLB network in the White House, right?

01:25.750 --> 01:26.800
I believe they do.

01:27.860 --> 01:30.950
There aren't too many stations that you can't get in the White House.

01:31.450 --> 01:35.000
You know, if I have to, I can have, you know, the CIA tap into something.

01:35.050 --> 01:37.950
You have that kind of pull? That's impressive.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.900
And the last one, Michael Young of the Texas Rangers.

01:41.050 --> 01:43.050
His question, "How can I help?"

01:43.800 --> 01:44.750
That's a nice question.

01:44.850 --> 01:50.700
And it turns out that Major League Baseball has actually been helping us to promote something called...

01:50.750 --> 01:51.550
...United We Serve.

01:52.600 --> 01:57.150
It's based on a simple idea and that is, "Government can't solve all our problems."

01:57.400 --> 02:01.900
And when it comes to energy, education, health care, community renewal,...

02:02.250 --> 02:12.100
...having ordinary citizens get involved and do whatever they think is a serious contribution,...

02:12.500 --> 02:13.600
...that can make all the difference.

02:13.650 --> 02:18.400
So it's tutoring a kid, mentoring somebody, working in the school, volunteering in a health clinic.
