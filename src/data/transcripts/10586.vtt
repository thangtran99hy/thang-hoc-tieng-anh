00:01.400 --> 00:04.450
On that day, much of this continent still lay in ruin.

00:05.450 --> 00:08.950
The rubble of this city had yet to be built into a wall.

00:10.050 --> 00:13.100
The Soviet shadow had swept across Eastern Europe,...

00:13.400 --> 00:18.800
...while in the West: America, Britain and France took their stock of their losses...

00:19.400 --> 00:21.650
...and pondered how the world might be remade.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.300
This is where the two sides met.

00:26.350 --> 00:29.500
And on the twenty-fourth of June 1948,...

00:30.250 --> 00:34.250
...the communists chose to blockade the western part of the city.

00:35.700 --> 00:39.450
They cut off food and supplies to more than two million Germans...

00:39.650 --> 00:44.050
...in an effort to extinguish the last flame of freedom in Berlin.

00:45.850 --> 00:50.100
The size of our forces was no match for the larger Soviet army...

00:51.150 --> 00:54.850
...and yet retreat would have allowed communism to march across Europe.

00:56.200 --> 01:00.600
Where the last war had ended, another world war could have easily begun...

01:01.650 --> 01:04.600
...and all that stood in the way was Berlin.

01:05.950 --> 01:09.750
And that's when the airlift began.

01:10.550 --> 01:14.600
When the largest and most unlikely rescue in the history...

01:15.450 --> 01:18.300
...brought food and hope to the people of this city.

01:19.650 --> 01:22.400
The odds were stacked against success.

01:23.650 --> 01:29.500
In the winter, a heavy fog filled the sky above and many planes were forced to turn back...

01:29.800 --> 01:31.800
...without dropping off the needed supplies.

01:32.600 --> 01:38.650
The streets where we stand were filled with hungry families who had no comfort from the cold.

01:40.250 --> 01:47.000
But in the darkest hours, the people of Berlin kept the flame of hope burning.

01:48.050 --> 01:51.750
The people of Berlin refused to give up.

01:56.400 --> 02:03.300
And on one fall day, hundreds of thousands of Berliners came here to the Tiergarten,...

02:03.850 --> 02:08.750
...and heard the city's mayor implore the world not to give up on freedom.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.600
"There is only one possibility,...", he said.

02:13.700 --> 02:18.750
"...for us to stand together united until this battle is won."

02:20.000 --> 02:22.200
"The people of Berlin have spoken."

02:22.900 --> 02:27.300
"We have done our duty...", he said. "...and we will keep on doing our duty."

02:28.300 --> 02:31.600
"People of the world, now do your duty."

02:32.350 --> 02:35.500
"People of the world, look at Berlin!"
