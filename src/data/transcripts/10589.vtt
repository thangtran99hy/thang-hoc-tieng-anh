00:00.100 --> 00:03.900
This is Flight 372 on SWA.

00:04.050 --> 00:06.200
The flight attendants on board serving you today:...

00:06.300 --> 00:08.600
...Theresa in the middle, David in the back.

00:08.700 --> 00:10.850
My name is David and I'm here to tell you that...

00:10.950 --> 00:13.050
...shortly after takeoff, first things first,...

00:13.100 --> 00:15.250
...there are soft drinks and coffee to quench your thirst...

00:15.300 --> 00:17.800
...but if you want another kind of drink then just holler.

00:17.850 --> 00:19.950
Alcoholic beverages, that'll be four dollars.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.150
If a Monster Energy Drink is your plan,...

00:22.200 --> 00:24.500
...that'll be three dollars and you get the whole can.

00:24.550 --> 00:26.950
We won't take your cash, you gotta pay with plastic.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.250
If you have a coupon, then that's fantastic.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.550
We know you're ready to get to new places.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.900
Open up the bins, put away your suitcases.

00:33.950 --> 00:35.900
Carry-on items go under the seat...

00:35.950 --> 00:38.350
...in front of you, so none of you have things by your feet.

00:38.550 --> 00:40.750
If you have a seat on a row with the exit,...

00:40.800 --> 00:43.100
...we're gonna talk to you so you might as well expect it.

00:43.150 --> 00:45.450
You gotta help evacuate in case we need you,...

00:45.500 --> 00:47.750
...if you don't wanna then we're gonna reseat you.

00:47.800 --> 00:52.400
Before we leave, our advice is put away your electronic devices.

00:52.450 --> 00:54.650
Fasten your seatbelt, then put your trays up.

00:54.700 --> 00:56.900
Press the button to make the seat back raise up.

00:56.950 --> 00:59.100
Sit back, relax, have a good time.

00:59.150 --> 01:01.450
It's almost time to go, so I'm done with the rhyme.

01:01.550 --> 01:03.550
Thank you for the fact that I wasn't ignored.

01:03.600 --> 01:06.100
This is Southwest Airlines. Welcome aboard!
