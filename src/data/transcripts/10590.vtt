I don't get it America. What's up with the vampire thing?

00:03.450 --> 00:05.800
I talked to some of my friends back home and they're all like,...

00:05.900 --> 00:09.275
..."Hey Emily, the newest thing, the greatest thing, the best thing..."

00:09.550 --> 00:13.950
"...in the US right now is vampires." and I said, "What?!"

00:14.250 --> 00:15.750
And they said, "Yes!"

00:16.100 --> 00:22.050
And they made me watch this Twilight movie, and it was not that impressive.

00:22.300 --> 00:27.900
I mean, it wasn't bad but it was... I don't know, not Harry Potter.

00:28.344 --> 00:32.029
I guess I can say, there is nothing, you know, state-of-the-art,...

00:32.105 --> 00:33.849
...nothing unique or creative...

00:34.000 --> 00:39.900
...except for the fact that vampires got like sparkles on their skin instead of dying in the sun,...

00:40.300 --> 00:41.950
...which breaks the rules.

00:42.150 --> 00:47.600
I mean, I read Anne Rice a long time ago when I was four, sitting on my mother's lap.

00:48.050 --> 00:49.750
Anyway, I just don't get it.

00:50.100 --> 00:55.200
And back in my days, I mean, I'm 20 years old, really old and everything,...

00:55.363 --> 00:56.517
...people said to me,...

00:56.591 --> 01:00.309
"Hey Emily, we're gonna make fun of you and say, you look like a vampire..."

01:00.350 --> 01:04.290
"...'cause you're really white and pasty, and have dark circles under your eyes."

01:05.000 --> 01:07.100
And I was made fun of for that.

01:07.550 --> 01:10.850
And now if I, you know, were young again, in school again,...

01:10.950 --> 01:12.600
...people would say like,...

01:13.085 --> 01:15.477
..."Hey, Emily you're so cool, you look like a vampire,..."

01:15.566 --> 01:18.374
"...won't you come to our party and be our BFFs?..."

01:18.800 --> 01:21.800
...which means, best friends forever I think, still, hopefully.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.850
Maybe that changed to mean something else.

01:25.600 --> 01:26.250
I don't get it.

01:26.750 --> 01:29.400
So, I'm gonna count on you guys for filling me in...

01:29.450 --> 01:32.850
...because back in the day you told me what Second Life was all about.

01:33.000 --> 01:42.600
And now, I just wanna know why girls get off on guys with square jawlines and pale skin.

01:43.233 --> 01:45.361
I mean, I shouldn't be one to talk.

01:45.449 --> 01:50.085
I also have a square jawline and pretty white skin but it's all right.

01:51.650 --> 01:55.550
So, just let me know and I'll look at your comments.

01:56.050 --> 01:56.925
Talk to you guys later.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.500
