Hey, this is Emily,...

00:00.989 --> 00:06.787
...and today I wanted to talk a little bit about my new band c.cedille...

00:07.250 --> 00:11.150
...because so many of you have been asking me questions, understandably.

00:12.900 --> 00:17.800
Basically, it's a band consisting of one other fellow named Serey,...

00:18.050 --> 00:20.500
...who plays guitar and sings.

00:20.550 --> 00:21.800
He's from Montreal.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.600
And it consists of me as well.

00:24.900 --> 00:28.100
And I sing, and attempt to play guitar and bass.

00:28.550 --> 00:33.350
And we play sort of acoustic, folk, indie rock music,...

00:33.400 --> 00:37.200
...if you can wrap your brain around what that's supposed to sound like.

00:39.550 --> 00:44.200
We've just been recording our first album over the past several months,...

00:44.640 --> 00:46.575
...and been having a wonderful time,...

00:46.662 --> 00:50.427
...and a lot of really amazing people have been helping us record.

00:50.900 --> 00:53.400
And just, it's been great.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.700
And we have one last recording session coming up.

00:57.100 --> 01:05.800
And then, we're gonna mix our stuff and hopefully we can get it out to you guys.

01:06.050 --> 01:10.700
We're planning on releasing our first song on iTunes in about January.

01:11.233 --> 01:13.185
But it's not 100% set in stone,...

01:13.334 --> 01:18.041
...so don't hold it against me if maybe it's a little delayed.

01:20.500 --> 01:26.700
And we had two concerts in Sapporo in October.

01:26.750 --> 01:33.200
One at the Apple Store in Sapporo and one at this live house and it was a ton of fun.

01:33.300 --> 01:36.400
And starting in January, February, early next year,...

01:36.700 --> 01:40.150
...we plan on having a lot more shows around the rest of Japan.

01:40.550 --> 01:43.800
So, if you're in Japan, then come check it out.

01:44.250 --> 01:48.600
All of our information is religiously updated on MySpace...

01:49.000 --> 01:53.650
...which I will post the link on the description of this video.

01:54.200 --> 01:59.700
But we don't have an official website yet, so please bear with the MySpace.

02:00.050 --> 02:06.950
I know it's uncool, MySpace is totally last century but, whatever.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.399
So, that's about it.

02:09.479 --> 02:12.577
That's what's been going on in my life lately.

02:12.667 --> 02:14.069
I've been super busy with that...

02:14.400 --> 02:15.650
...as some of you may know.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.700
So, hope to see some of you guys at a gig in the future.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.650
And thanks for watching, and thanks for listening. Bye!
