00:00.550 --> 00:03.150
What was your approach to making this album?

00:04.300 --> 00:09.700
I wanted it to be very dramatic and emotional.

00:10.700 --> 00:15.500
And I was using a lot of classic things that I've used before.

00:15.950 --> 00:24.050
So, I wanted to try to top myself and make even, you know, a better song out of the classic theme.

00:24.100 --> 00:26.800
But I'm not really sure if I achieved that goal.

00:26.850 --> 00:34.600
But I think that what I was really going for in this album was a lot of very emotional...

00:34.650 --> 00:36.400
...kind of dramatic love songs.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.150
What was the most challenging part?

00:40.150 --> 00:43.600
It's always challenging to use classical music and...

00:43.650 --> 00:46.800
...and to try to make a pop song out of it.

00:47.100 --> 00:52.950
I mean, I've been doing it a long time and it's going to eternally be challenging.

00:54.600 --> 00:59.750
How did you initially come up with the idea of mixing pop and classical music?

01:01.600 --> 01:06.000
Well, that really has to be accredited to Gio, my producer...

01:06.050 --> 01:10.350
...because he has a really strong background in classical music.

01:10.900 --> 01:17.950
And he just wanted to try to combine kind of opposite elements.

01:18.450 --> 01:24.050
And he had a very, you know, ended up making a successful music with it.

01:24.100 --> 01:32.075
And it just, you know, people kind of... it would just become such a popular concept from us...

01:32.125 --> 01:34.450
...that people wanted to hear more and more, and more of it.

01:35.050 --> 01:39.950
And we kept thinking it would go away but obviously it hasn't.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.850
I mean, it still means a lot... to a lot of people.

01:44.650 --> 01:48.450
So before, you were not so into classical music?

01:49.200 --> 01:54.100
I always loved classical music and I, you know, I think everybody has an appreciation for it.

01:54.200 --> 02:05.550
But working with it in the past eight years has definitely developed my interest and my liking towards it.

02:06.500 --> 02:09.250
What's the most appealing about classical music?

02:11.000 --> 02:19.100
I think the... Well, I mean, it's just a lot of genius chord progressions.

02:21.900 --> 02:28.500
I think breaking it down and then figuring out why it works, and kind of this simple...

02:31.250 --> 02:32.500
I'm not describing it right.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.450
It's... I mean, they're masterpieces.

02:35.900 --> 02:43.000
...you know, and it's something to admire and try to aspire to aiming for the rest of your life.
