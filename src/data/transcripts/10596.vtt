00:01.500 --> 00:03.700
Now, one of those issues that I'll focus on today...

00:04.800 --> 00:08.400
...is fundamental to the security of our nations and to the peace of the world.

00:09.150 --> 00:12.300
That's the future of nuclear weapons in the 21st century.

00:13.800 --> 00:20.350
The existence of thousands of nuclear weapons is the most dangerous legacy of the Cold War.

00:21.750 --> 00:25.700
No nuclear war was fought between the United States and the Soviet Union,...

00:26.600 --> 00:32.600
...but generations lived with the knowledge that their world could be erased in a single flash of light.

00:33.850 --> 00:37.700
Cities like Prague that existed for centuries,...

00:37.750 --> 00:43.100
...that embodied the beauty and the talent of so much of humanity,...

00:43.400 --> 00:44.850
...would have ceased to exist.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.350
Today, the Cold War has disappeared...

00:49.750 --> 00:52.200
...but thousands of those weapons have not.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.450
In a strange turn of history,...

00:55.650 --> 00:58.950
...the threat of global nuclear war has gone down,...

00:59.950 --> 01:03.650
...but the risk of a nuclear attack has gone up.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.250
More nations have acquired these weapons.

01:08.850 --> 01:10.350
Testing has continued.

01:11.050 --> 01:16.550
Black market trade in nuclear secrets and nuclear materials abound.

01:17.850 --> 01:20.850
The technology to build a bomb has spread.

01:21.650 --> 01:24.750
Terrorists are determined to buy, build or steal one.

01:25.750 --> 01:30.700
Our efforts to contain these dangers are centered on a global non-proliferation regime...

01:30.900 --> 01:33.800
...but as more people and nations break the rules,...

01:34.550 --> 01:37.500
...we could reach the point where the center cannot hold.

01:39.600 --> 01:43.050
Now, understand, this matters to people everywhere.

01:44.500 --> 01:48.700
One nuclear weapon exploded in one city,...

01:49.900 --> 01:57.900
...be it New York or Moscow, Islamabad or Mumbai, Tokyo or Tel Aviv, Paris or Prague,...

01:59.300 --> 02:01.100
...could kill hundreds of thousands of people.

02:02.250 --> 02:07.550
And no matter where it happens, there is no end to what the consequences might be,...

02:08.250 --> 02:13.900
...for our global safety, our security, our society, our economy, to our ultimate survival.
