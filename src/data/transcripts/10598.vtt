00:00.250 --> 00:02.200
Because as B.B. King put it,...

00:02.400 --> 00:07.000
..."The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take that away from you."

00:07.450 --> 00:12.650
And learning is really in the broadest sense what I really want to talk about today,...

00:12.700 --> 00:15.850
...because your education, of course, isn't ending here.

00:15.900 --> 00:17.850
In many ways, it's only just begun.

00:17.950 --> 00:21.900
The world has so many lessons to teach you.

00:22.400 --> 00:30.200
I consider the world, this Earth to be like a school and our life the classrooms.

00:30.450 --> 00:35.800
And sometimes here in this "Planet Earth School", the lessons often come dressed up...

00:36.000 --> 00:40.650
...as detours or roadblocks and sometimes as full-blown crises.

00:40.900 --> 00:45.800
And the secret I've learned to getting ahead is being open to the lessons.

00:46.250 --> 00:51.800
Lessons from the grandest universe of all, that is the universe itself.

00:52.250 --> 00:56.900
It's being able to walk through life eager and open to self-improvement...

00:57.100 --> 00:59.800
...and that which is going to best help you evolve,...

00:59.900 --> 01:04.400
...'cause that's really why we're here, to evolve as human beings.

01:04.900 --> 01:08.800
So, to grow into being more of ourselves,...

01:09.050 --> 01:11.900
...always moving to the next level of understanding,...

01:12.000 --> 01:14.650
...the next level of compassion and growth.

01:14.800 --> 01:17.750
I think one of the greatest compliments I've ever received,...

01:17.900 --> 01:21.700
...I interviewed with a reporter when I was first starting out in Chicago...

01:21.950 --> 01:25.500
...and then many years later, I saw the same reporter, and she said to me,...

01:25.550 --> 01:31.950
..."You know what? You really haven't changed. You've just become more of yourself."

01:32.600 --> 01:37.650
And that is really what we're all trying to do, become more of ourselves.

01:37.750 --> 01:43.200
And I believe that there's a lesson in almost everything that you do, and every experience,...

01:43.500 --> 01:47.100
...and getting the lesson is how you move forward.

01:47.150 --> 01:50.100
It's how you enrich your spirit.

01:50.400 --> 01:54.100
And trust me, I know that inner wisdom is more precious than wealth.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.500
The more you spend it, the more you gain.
