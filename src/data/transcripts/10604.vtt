I'm just back from the White Dinner party in Paris where I had a lot of fun.

00:05.550 --> 00:10.392
Unlike last year where I only took photos, this time I also participated.

00:10.957 --> 00:11.930
What a thrill!

00:12.428 --> 00:14.979
I received my instructions from my contact.

00:15.497 --> 00:18.791
There is no central organizer, at least nobody knows him...

00:19.277 --> 00:21.456
...but only contacts of contacts.

00:22.072 --> 00:25.428
I was supposed to join my group at 9:00 p.m. in front of a church.

00:25.892 --> 00:27.452
Around 9:15 p.m.,...

00:27.635 --> 00:31.050
...someone who obviously knew where the dinner was going to take place...

00:31.485 --> 00:33.788
...took the group to the Champs Elysees!

00:34.279 --> 00:35.927
Within the blink of an eye,...

00:36.229 --> 00:41.689
...the whole lower part of the avenue was covered in tables, chairs, candles...

00:42.011 --> 00:43.571
...and people dressed in white.

00:43.998 --> 00:44.932
Fascinating!

00:45.437 --> 00:48.761
Around 10:00 p.m., a band started to play music...

00:49.566 --> 00:54.222
...and at 11:00 p.m. sharp, everyone lit sparkling sticks.

00:54.625 --> 00:55.496
Beautiful!

00:56.060 --> 00:59.849
Magical moment, even if the weather was a little chilly.
