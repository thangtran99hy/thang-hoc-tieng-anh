00:01.533 --> 00:01.933
Good morning!

00:08.233 --> 00:11.210
It is a great honor to be in Tokyo,...

00:12.600 --> 00:17.450
...the first stop on my first visit to Asia as president of the United States.

00:27.233 --> 00:31.983
It's good to be among so many of you Japanese. And I see a few Americans here...

00:37.011 --> 00:41.583
...who work every day to strengthen the bonds between our two countries,...

00:42.567 --> 00:47.750
...including my longtime friend and our new ambassador to Japan, John Roos.

00:55.367 --> 00:57.183
It is wonderful to be back in Japan.

00:58.033 --> 01:00.343
Some of you may be aware that when I was a young boy,...

01:00.967 --> 01:03.250
...my mother brought me to Kamakura...

01:04.233 --> 01:10.583
...where I looked up at that centuries-old symbol of peace and tranquility,...

01:10.900 --> 01:12.850
...the great bronze Amida Buddha.

01:14.067 --> 01:18.083
And as a child, I was more focused on the matcha ice cream.

01:21.500 --> 01:27.530
And I wanna thank Prime Minister Hatoyama for sharing some of those memories...

01:27.587 --> 01:29.270
...with more ice cream last night at dinner.

01:31.393 --> 01:32.250
Thank you very much.

01:37.633 --> 01:40.430
But I have never forgotten the warmth and the hospitality...

01:40.900 --> 01:44.983
...that the Japanese people showed a young American far from home,...

01:46.500 --> 01:49.083
...and I feel that same spirit on this visit.

01:50.433 --> 01:53.743
In the gracious welcome of Prime Minister Hatoyama.

01:54.967 --> 02:01.423
In the extraordinary honor of the meeting with their Imperial Majesties, the Emperor and Empress...

02:01.947 --> 02:06.697
...on the 20th anniversary of his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne.

02:07.940 --> 02:10.583
In the hospitality shown by the Japanese people.

02:11.567 --> 02:13.443
And of course, I could not come here...

02:13.519 --> 02:18.050
...without sending my greetings and gratitude to the citizens of Obama, Japan.
