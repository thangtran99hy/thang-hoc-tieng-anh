00:00.550 --> 00:03.150
Now, I am beginning my journey here for a simple reason.

00:04.350 --> 00:08.400
Since taking office, I have worked to renew American leadership...

00:08.800 --> 00:15.100
...and pursue a new era of engagement with the world based on mutual interests and mutual respect.

00:16.150 --> 00:21.000
And our efforts in the Asia Pacific will be rooted in no small measure...

00:21.850 --> 00:26.400
...through an enduring and revitalized alliance between the United States and Japan.

00:27.700 --> 00:29.900
From my very first days in office,...

00:30.550 --> 00:33.750
...we have worked to strengthen the ties that bind our nations.

00:34.750 --> 00:39.300
The first foreign leader that I welcomed to the White House was the Prime Minister of Japan.

00:40.200 --> 00:43.400
And for the first time in nearly fifty years, the first foreign trip...

00:43.800 --> 00:49.700
...by an American Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was to Asia, starting in Japan.

00:56.100 --> 01:00.350
In two months, our alliance will mark its 50th anniversary.

01:01.200 --> 01:05.875
A day when President Dwight Eisenhower stood next to Japan's Prime Minister...

01:05.925 --> 01:10.350
...and said that, our two nations were creating an indestructible partnership...

01:10.950 --> 01:14.100
...based on equality and mutual understanding.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.350
In the half century since,...

01:17.700 --> 01:22.000
...that alliance has endured as a foundation for our security and prosperity.

01:22.950 --> 01:26.050
It has helped us become the world's two largest economies,...

01:26.400 --> 01:31.750
...with Japan emerging as America's second-largest trading partner outside of North America.

01:32.900 --> 01:36.850
It has evolved as Japan has played a larger role on the world stage...

01:37.150 --> 01:40.900
...and made important contributions to stability around the world.

01:41.350 --> 01:46.200
From reconstruction in Iraq, to combating piracy off the Horn of Africa,...

01:46.650 --> 01:49.700
...to assistance for the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan,...

01:50.350 --> 01:54.200
...most recently through its remarkable leadership in providing additional commitments...

01:54.450 --> 01:56.200
...to international development efforts there.

01:57.700 --> 02:02.250
Above all, our alliance has endured because it reflects our common values.

02:03.150 --> 02:10.250
A belief in the democratic right of free people to choose their own leaders and realize their own dreams.

02:11.050 --> 02:17.100
A belief that made possible the election of both Prime Minister Hatoyama and myself on the promise of change.

02:18.267 --> 02:21.937
And together, we are committed to providing a new generation of leadership...

02:22.060 --> 02:23.868
...for our people, and our alliance.

02:25.100 --> 02:28.200
That is why, at this critical moment in history,...

02:29.000 --> 02:33.550
...the two of us have not only reaffirmed our alliance, we have agreed to deepen it.

02:34.700 --> 02:38.275
We have agreed to move expeditiously through a joint working group...

02:38.325 --> 02:44.500
...to implement the agreement that our two governments reached on restructuring US forces in Okinawa.

02:45.450 --> 02:48.250
And as our alliance evolves and adapts for the future,...

02:48.650 --> 02:53.350
...we will always strive to uphold the spirit that President Eisenhower described long ago.

02:53.950 --> 02:57.000
A partnership of equality and mutual respect.
