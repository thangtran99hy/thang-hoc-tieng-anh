Last night, I managed to take some time off...

00:03.502 --> 00:06.650
...to go to the restaurant, General Lafayette, with some friends.

00:07.433 --> 00:09.717
I had a Parisian dish called steak tartare.

00:10.333 --> 00:13.117
That is raw beef, prepared with a mix of ingredients...

00:13.633 --> 00:17.717
...including: ketchup, egg yolk, onions, Worcester Sauce, etc.

00:18.467 --> 00:23.383
In the restaurant, they even add nut chips and blue cheese crumbs. Yummy!

00:24.167 --> 00:26.250
Well, that is if you like raw meat, of course.

00:26.793 --> 00:31.183
I looked everywhere and could not find the origin of steak tartare for sure,...

00:31.800 --> 00:36.383
...but one thing seems to be certain: originally, it was meant to be horse meat.

00:37.233 --> 00:38.967
My friends told me that in the US,...

00:39.300 --> 00:43.783
...restaurants would be reluctant to serve raw meat because of liabilities.
