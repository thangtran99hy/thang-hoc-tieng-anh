I know there are many who question how the United States perceives China's emergence.

00:06.900 --> 00:10.150
But as I have said, in an interconnected world,...

00:10.750 --> 00:13.300
...power does not need to be a zero-sum game,...

00:14.250 --> 00:17.700
...and nations need not fear the success of another.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.300
Cultivating spheres of cooperation, not competing spheres of influence...

00:23.700 --> 00:26.100
...will lead to progress in the Asia Pacific.

00:33.450 --> 00:38.550
Now as with any nation, America will approach China with a focus on our interests.

00:39.900 --> 00:42.200
But it's precisely for this reason that it is important...

00:42.250 --> 00:46.000
...to pursue pragmatic cooperation with China on issues of mutual concern,...

00:46.450 --> 00:51.000
...because no one nation can meet the challenges of the 21st century alone,...

00:51.700 --> 00:57.400
...and the United States and China will both be better off when we are able to meet them together.

00:58.200 --> 01:01.750
That's why we welcome China's effort to play a greater role on the world stage.

01:02.150 --> 01:06.300
A role in which their growing economy is joined by growing responsibility.

01:07.250 --> 01:11.550
China's partnership has proved critical in our effort to jumpstart economic recovery.

01:12.100 --> 01:15.400
China has promoted security and stability in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

01:15.950 --> 01:20.250
And it is now committed to the global non-proliferation regime,...

01:20.600 --> 01:24.500
...and supporting the pursuit of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

01:25.450 --> 01:27.850
So the United States does not seek to contain China,...

01:28.250 --> 01:33.650
...nor does a deeper relationship with China mean a weakening of our bilateral alliances.

01:34.650 --> 01:37.875
On the contrary, the rise of a strong and prosperous China...

01:37.925 --> 01:40.600
...can be a source of strength for the community of nations.

01:41.250 --> 01:45.650
And so in Beijing and beyond, we will work to deepen our strategic and economic dialog,...

01:46.050 --> 01:48.800
...and improve communication between our militaries.

01:49.750 --> 01:51.600
Of course, we will not agree on every issue,...

01:52.300 --> 01:56.600
...and the United States will never waver in speaking up for the fundamental values that we hold dear.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.700
And that includes respect for the religion and cultures of all people.

02:01.500 --> 02:05.700
Because support for human rights and human dignity is ingrained in America.

02:06.600 --> 02:11.100
We can move these discussions forward in a spirit of partnership rather than rancor.
