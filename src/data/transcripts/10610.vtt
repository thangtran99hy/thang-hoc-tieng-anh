00:00.700 --> 00:04.200
For decades, the United States has had one of the most open markets in the world...

00:04.750 --> 00:08.700
...and that openness has helped to fuel the success of so many countries in this region...

00:08.900 --> 00:10.750
...and others over the last century.

00:11.900 --> 00:17.700
In this new era, opening other markets around the globe will be critical not just to America's prosperity,...

00:17.950 --> 00:19.050
...but to the world's as well.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.100
An integral part of this new strategy is working towards an ambitious and balanced Doha Agreement.

00:26.800 --> 00:31.700
Not any agreement, but an agreement that will open up markets and increase exports around the world.

00:32.400 --> 00:37.600
We are ready to work with our Asian partners to see if we can achieve that objective in a timely fashion.

00:37.900 --> 00:40.900
And we invite our regional trading partners to join us at the table.

00:42.150 --> 00:45.700
We also believe that continued integration of the economies of this region...

00:45.750 --> 00:49.800
...will benefit workers, consumers and businesses in all our nations.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.550
Together with our South Korean friends,...

00:52.600 --> 00:57.250
...we will work through the issues necessary to move forward on a trade agreement with them.

00:58.300 --> 01:02.500
The United States will also be engaging with the Trans-Pacific Partnership countries...

01:02.700 --> 01:06.700
...with the goal of shaping a regional agreement that will have broad-based membership...

01:07.050 --> 01:10.050
...and the high standards worthy of a 21st century trade agreement.

01:11.300 --> 01:16.100
Working in partnership, this is how we can sustain this recovery and advance our common prosperity.

01:17.300 --> 01:20.350
But it's not enough to pursue growth that is balanced.

01:20.850 --> 01:23.100
We also need growth that is sustainable.

01:23.600 --> 01:28.450
For our planet and the future generations that will live here.
