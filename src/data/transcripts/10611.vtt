Hello! Welcome to Michael's Business Top Tips.

00:06.700 --> 00:11.200
My name is Michael Jones and today, I'm looking at goal setting.

00:12.450 --> 00:16.800
Now, every day in our general life and especially in business,...

00:17.050 --> 00:21.600
...we are setting goals, targets or objectives we need to accomplish.

00:22.300 --> 00:28.700
However often we don't think, "How can we set the most effective goals?"

00:29.800 --> 00:32.600
Now, there's been a lot of research done into goal setting.

00:33.150 --> 00:38.450
And the research has shown that using clear, effective goal setting techniques...

00:38.700 --> 00:44.200
...improves your business efficiency, and your likelihood of achieving your goals.

00:45.200 --> 00:49.050
Today, I'd like to recommend SMART goal setting technique.

00:49.850 --> 00:58.100
SMART means: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.450
When you're setting goals in the future,...

01:01.500 --> 01:05.100
...for business or study, or losing weight, or whatever,...

01:05.400 --> 01:08.350
...try to remember that SMART technique:...

01:08.550 --> 01:14.350
...Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely.

01:15.550 --> 01:16.700
Try this yourself.

01:17.950 --> 01:22.800
Now, set three business goals that are SMART...

01:23.500 --> 01:28.000
...and set three personal goals that are SMART.

01:28.850 --> 01:31.700
For example, a personal goal could be,...

01:31.850 --> 01:36.400
..."I will learn ten new English words from AERA English this month."

01:36.950 --> 01:38.250
That would be a SMART goal.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.450
Okay, I hope you enjoyed this month's Top Tip.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.750
Next month, I'll be back with another Business Top Tip.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.900
