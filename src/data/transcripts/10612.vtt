00:03.065 --> 00:03.870
Oh, look at this.

00:04.135 --> 00:04.900
It's the real thing too.

00:05.080 --> 00:05.575
Man...

00:06.940 --> 00:08.475
That is a spiffy-looking car.

00:10.765 --> 00:12.910
They've changed in appearance over the last few years.

00:13.385 --> 00:15.445
NASCAR's worked really hard to make them a lot safer.

00:15.935 --> 00:18.785
So tell me, from soup to nuts, from start to finish.

00:18.985 --> 00:20.540
How do you guys start building one of these?

00:21.015 --> 00:24.490
You start under the hood. You have all the tubular chassis and everything that's under there.

00:26.455 --> 00:28.495
So there are specs anymore for everything.

00:29.730 --> 00:30.630
You can tell I don't do this often.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.730
Yeah right, I can tell you need a pit crew, man.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.535
So there are specs for the weight of the vehicle, the tubing,...

00:37.835 --> 00:42.375
...and a lot of the safety stuff that's around it. But you build the chassis and the body is all...

00:42.605 --> 00:46.545
...except for the nose and trunk, is made of fiberglass. It's provided by the manufacturer.

00:46.675 --> 00:49.450
But in here is where the real magic has happened lately.

00:50.450 --> 00:53.585
These seats are made of carbon fiber and we've been through some extensive testing...

00:54.065 --> 00:56.455
...to control the body in an impact, and the head.

00:57.465 --> 01:00.395
This is a mold that's made of my body and what's comfortable for me,...

01:00.760 --> 01:03.295
...contains my head and we also have a harness device that goes around the neck.

01:03.495 --> 01:07.265
Now, you got a whole bunch of stuff on... This does not look like my dashboard, guys.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.000
It looks a little different.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.105
So over here's the main power switch.

01:13.595 --> 01:16.840
And then the two battery switches here, so we've got two systems...

01:17.075 --> 01:19.015
...of everything in the car, from radio boxes,...

01:19.645 --> 01:22.145
...ignition boxes and battery circuits as well.

01:22.650 --> 01:23.995
It's hard to see in here now...

01:24.250 --> 01:29.485
...but there's a series of five lights, and as the RPM gets close to the limit...

01:30.020 --> 01:33.560
...you kinda use the gas and brake to maintain that speed for pit road.

01:33.825 --> 01:36.165
How much are you talking to your pit crew the whole time?

01:36.895 --> 01:39.130
My job... there's no telemetry in the vehicle.

01:39.530 --> 01:42.904
A lot of other forms of racing... you can... they have active telemetry where you can see what's going on.

01:43.500 --> 01:44.805
So I have to be the computer.

01:44.905 --> 01:50.005
Every 5 to 10 laps, I explain where I'm having trouble with the car so they can keep...

01:50.375 --> 01:53.345
...working on adjustments and combinations of things from tire pressures,...

01:53.615 --> 01:55.515
...adjusting weight and springs, and...

01:55.830 --> 01:59.420
So, you're just making a whole series of calculations constantly even as you're driving.

01:59.853 --> 02:03.490
It's like "Okay, I feel like the left tire's a little off or this or that".

02:03.795 --> 02:07.560
Truthfully, you feel like you're complaining all the time because all you're doing is telling them what it's doing wrong.

02:08.025 --> 02:09.025
So at the end of the day,...

02:09.295 --> 02:11.680
...when you see each other, you feel bad almost to a certain degree, that...

02:11.865 --> 02:14.175
...I've just been complaining all day long to you about this vehicle.

02:14.475 --> 02:15.105
And we won but...

02:15.535 --> 02:16.620
...or, we had a good day so...
