00:01.000 --> 00:05.400
In Prague, I affirmed America's commitment to rid the world of nuclear weapons...

00:05.850 --> 00:08.500
...and laid out a comprehensive agenda to pursue this goal.

00:15.350 --> 00:17.600
I am pleased that Japan has joined us in this effort,...

00:18.500 --> 00:21.400
...for no two nations on Earth know better what these weapons can do...

00:21.950 --> 00:23.900
...and together we must seek a future without them.

00:25.100 --> 00:26.900
This is fundamental to our common security...

00:27.300 --> 00:30.000
...and this is a great test of our common humanity.

00:30.550 --> 00:32.350
Our very future hangs in the balance.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.550
Now, let me be clear. So long as these weapons exist,...

00:37.100 --> 00:40.500
...the United States will maintain a strong and effective nuclear deterrent...

00:40.650 --> 00:44.250
...that guarantees the defense of our allies, including South Korea and Japan.

00:50.700 --> 00:54.500
But we must recognize that an escalating nuclear arms race in this region...

00:54.550 --> 00:58.500
...would undermine decades of growth and prosperity.

00:59.850 --> 01:05.200
So we are called upon to uphold the basic bargain of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty:...

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
...That all nations have a right to peaceful nuclear energy,...

01:09.850 --> 01:15.200
...that nations with nuclear weapons have a responsibility to move toward nuclear disarmament...

01:15.900 --> 01:20.500
...and those without nuclear weapons have a responsibility to forsake them.

01:21.950 --> 01:25.000
Indeed, Japan serves as an example to the world...

01:25.600 --> 01:29.950
...that true peace and power can be achieved by taking this path.

01:37.714 --> 01:41.713
For decades, Japan has enjoyed the benefits of peaceful nuclear energy,...

01:41.888 --> 01:43.969
...while rejecting nuclear arms development.

01:44.450 --> 01:49.100
And by any measure, this has increased Japan's security and enhanced its position.
