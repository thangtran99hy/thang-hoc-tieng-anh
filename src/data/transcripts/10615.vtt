00:00.850 --> 00:05.500
For decades, North Korea has chosen a path of confrontation and provocation,...

00:06.100 --> 00:08.150
...including the pursuit of nuclear weapons.

00:09.500 --> 00:12.000
It should be clear where this path leads.

00:13.250 --> 00:15.300
We have tightened sanctions on Pyongyang.

00:16.100 --> 00:19.450
We have passed the most sweeping U.N. Security Council resolution to date...

00:19.750 --> 00:22.350
...to restrict their weapons of mass destruction activities.

00:23.150 --> 00:24.950
We will not be cowed by threats...

00:25.093 --> 00:28.325
...and we will continue to send a clear message through our actions,...

00:28.697 --> 00:30.071
...and not just our words.

00:30.300 --> 00:33.350
North Korea's refusal to meet its international obligations...

00:33.800 --> 00:36.250
...will lead only to less security, not more.

00:38.050 --> 00:40.300
Yet there is another path that can be taken.

00:41.450 --> 00:44.150
Working in tandem with our partners...

00:45.100 --> 00:47.900
...supported by direct diplomacy.

00:48.750 --> 00:52.000
The United States is prepared to offer North Korea a different future.

00:52.900 --> 00:56.950
Instead of an isolation that has compounded the horrific repression of its own people,...

00:57.550 --> 01:00.850
...North Korea could have a future of international integration.

01:01.950 --> 01:05.400
Instead of gripping poverty, it could have a future of economic opportunity...

01:05.967 --> 01:08.455
...where trade and investment, and tourism...

01:08.689 --> 01:11.673
...can offer the North Korean people the chance at a better life.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.750
And instead of increasing insecurity,...

01:15.250 --> 01:18.050
...it could have a future of greater security and respect.

01:19.900 --> 01:22.450
This respect cannot be earned through belligerence.

01:22.950 --> 01:27.050
It must be reached by a nation that takes its place in the international community...

01:27.150 --> 01:29.850
...by fully living up to its international obligations.

01:30.700 --> 01:33.900
So, the path for North Korea to realize this future is clear.

01:34.450 --> 01:36.150
A return to the six-party talks,...

01:36.700 --> 01:38.167
...upholding previous commitments,...

01:38.624 --> 01:42.041
...including a return to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,...

01:42.450 --> 01:46.400
...and the full and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

01:47.700 --> 01:51.300
And full normalization with its neighbors can also only come...

01:51.600 --> 01:55.450
...if Japanese families receive a full accounting of those who have been abducted.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.400
These are all steps that can be taken by the North Korean government...

02:06.450 --> 02:10.350
...if they are interested in improving the lives of their people and joining the community of nations.
