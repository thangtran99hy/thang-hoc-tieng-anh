00:00.767 --> 00:03.937
These are steps that the United States will take to improve prosperity,...

00:04.097 --> 00:06.524
...security and human dignity in the Asia Pacific.

00:07.350 --> 00:10.050
We will do so through our close friendship with Japan,...

00:10.650 --> 00:13.300
...which will always be a centerpiece of our efforts in the region.

00:14.200 --> 00:18.400
We will do so as a partner, through the broader engagement that I've discussed today.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.600
We will do so as a Pacific nation,...

00:22.050 --> 00:25.800
...with a president who was shaped in part by this piece of the globe.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.150
And we will do so with the same sense of purpose...

00:29.200 --> 00:33.550
...that has guided our ties with the Japanese people for nearly 50 years.

00:34.850 --> 00:39.200
The story of how these ties were forged dates back to the middle of the last century,...

00:39.800 --> 00:42.700
...sometime after the guns of war had quieted in the Pacific.

00:43.750 --> 00:47.250
It was then that America's commitment to the security and stability of Japan,...

00:48.000 --> 00:51.650
...along with the Japanese people's spirit of resilience and industriousness,...

00:52.100 --> 00:54.100
...led to what's been called, the Japanese miracle.

00:54.900 --> 01:00.800
A period of economic growth that was faster and more robust than anything the world had seen for some time.

01:02.150 --> 01:05.200
In the coming years and decades, this miracle would spread throughout the region...

01:05.767 --> 01:07.165
...and in a single generation,...

01:07.738 --> 01:11.103
...the lives and fortunes of millions were forever changed for the better.

01:12.350 --> 01:15.900
It is progress that has been supported by a hard-earned peace...

01:16.350 --> 01:19.400
...and strengthened by new bridges of mutual understanding...

01:19.700 --> 01:23.150
...that have bound together the nations of this vast and sprawling space.
