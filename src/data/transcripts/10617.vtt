00:01.100 --> 00:03.500
But we know that there's still work to be done.

00:04.100 --> 00:06.407
So that new breakthroughs in science and technology...

00:06.493 --> 00:08.491
...can lead to jobs on both sides of the Pacific,...

00:08.950 --> 00:10.650
...and security from a warming planet.

00:11.200 --> 00:14.050
So that we can reverse the spread of deadly weapons.

00:14.550 --> 00:18.300
And on a divided peninsula, the people of South can be free from fear,...

00:18.750 --> 00:21.150
...and those in the North can live free from want.

00:21.900 --> 00:25.000
So that a young girl can be valued not for her body, but for her mind.

00:25.127 --> 00:28.225
And so that young people everywhere can go as far as their talent,...

00:28.357 --> 00:30.223
...their drive, and their choices will take them.

00:31.750 --> 00:32.950
None of these will come easy...

00:33.700 --> 00:35.300
...nor without setback or struggle.

00:36.350 --> 00:37.950
But at this moment of renewal,...

00:38.700 --> 00:40.300
...in this land of miracles,...

00:41.050 --> 00:42.650
...history tells us it is possible.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.650
This is the America's agenda.

00:46.250 --> 00:48.600
This is the purpose of our partnership with Japan...

00:49.050 --> 00:50.900
...and with the nations, and peoples of this region.

00:51.600 --> 00:55.100
And there must be no doubt: As America's first Pacific president,...

00:56.150 --> 00:59.750
...I promise you that this Pacific nation will strengthen and sustain our leadership...

01:00.050 --> 01:01.800
...in this vitally important part of the world.

01:02.400 --> 01:03.300
Thank you very much.
