Stefani Germanotta tried a subtler approach to the music business.

00:08.100 --> 00:11.750
For a while, I had this very long brown hair...

00:11.800 --> 00:16.900
...and I was really into Bob Dylan, and Jefferson Airplane, and Grace Slick.

00:18.050 --> 00:20.100
I was doing just a different kind of music.

00:20.150 --> 00:25.100
It was not until she changed her sound and became Lady Gaga, that her career took off.

00:32.750 --> 00:35.150
With the success of her debut CD, The Fame,...

00:35.350 --> 00:38.550
...she has gone from a struggling singer-songwriter to a headliner...

00:38.800 --> 00:40.400
...with a well-known opening act.

Her success might seem sudden...

01:07.750 --> 01:10.375
...but the groundwork was laid by years of music lessons,...

01:10.425 --> 01:12.900
...and performing in local clubs for little money.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.850
I mean, I've been playing piano since I was four and been studying...

01:17.900 --> 01:23.800
...and whether it was in music theory classes, or I was in jazz band, or writing music,...

01:23.850 --> 01:28.200
...and around 14, I started to play out in local clubs.

01:28.250 --> 01:32.400
My mother would take me and sign me up on the open mic night sheet.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.900
I could tell the story forever but really it's just that I never gave up,...

01:37.950 --> 01:40.150
...and music has always been my destiny.
