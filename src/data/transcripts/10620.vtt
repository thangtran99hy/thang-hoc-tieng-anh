Ever since I was a little girl, music has always been like, a really big part of my life.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.700
So, it's been really cool to, you know, be back into the studio...

00:22.750 --> 00:24.900
...and working with people like Doctor Luke,...

00:24.950 --> 00:27.950
...and amazing producers that I've been able to work with.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.375
They're so refreshing to be around and their sounds are amazing,...

00:31.425 --> 00:34.300
...and just really cool, and inspiring people to be with.

00:53.050 --> 00:57.050
It's so much fun because you never know what you're gonna get when you go into the studio,...

00:57.150 --> 00:59.450
...which is like an experiment, a scientific project.

00:59.500 --> 01:03.200
And you go in, and you know, you get on a vibe with a certain person.

01:03.250 --> 01:05.750
And then, right when you think you're gonna get bored, you know, the song's done.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.850
And then, you go on with someone else and you know,...

01:07.900 --> 01:10.350
...and then, add such a cool flavor to the CD.

01:10.700 --> 01:14.475
It has like... it's like all different flavors of ice cream, you know. It's cool. ice creams.

01:20.800 --> 01:23.250
I really have grown attached to these songs.

01:24.100 --> 01:30.000
Just because if... like being in the studio and being able to dance to songs that I genuinely love...

01:30.050 --> 01:33.050
...is like such... it's like rejuvenation for me.

01:33.100 --> 01:39.700
And you know... and so, music is like such an exciting and a good part of my life.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.600
It's really good for my soul.

01:41.800 --> 01:46.300
So, you know, I love the music right now and I can't wait to go on the road with it...

01:46.350 --> 01:47.500
...and share it with people.
