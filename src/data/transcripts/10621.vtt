00:02.700 --> 00:05.600
President Obama, I'd like to welcome you to Japan.

00:07.550 --> 00:10.000
I'd like to express my heartfelt welcome to you.

00:22.950 --> 00:30.900
It is very hard, despite the tragedy of the mass shooting in your country,...

00:30.950 --> 00:35.900
...that you have taken time out of your busy schedule to come and join us here today.

00:35.950 --> 00:38.350
We're very thankful for you... to you.

00:38.800 --> 00:43.550
And today, we have had a 90-minute, very intensive discussion.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.500
I'm very happy to have had this opportunity to hold this discussion.

00:48.400 --> 00:51.800
Well, we've come to call each other Barack and Yukio.

00:52.450 --> 00:57.250
I think we've quite... I've grown quite accustomed to calling each other by our names...

00:57.950 --> 01:00.050
...and we did cover a lot of ground today.

01:02.400 --> 01:09.550
First, for Japan's diplomacy, the US-Japan alliance is the cornerstone...

01:10.100 --> 01:12.100
...and this is one thing that I've stressed.

01:12.650 --> 01:17.800
But as time changes and as the international environment changes,...

01:18.300 --> 01:24.050
...there is a need for us to further develop and deepen the US-Japan alliance...

01:24.100 --> 01:29.850
...to make it even more constructive and future oriented alliance,...

01:31.400 --> 01:34.200
...and this was what I proposed today.

01:34.850 --> 01:40.850
And the US-Japan alliance... well actually, it so happens that next year...

01:40.900 --> 01:45.550
...marks the 50th anniversary of the revision of the US-Japan Security Treaty.

01:45.900 --> 01:53.250
And starting from today, we'll be spending a year to start a new process of deliberation.

01:54.150 --> 01:56.000
And I had made this proposal,...

01:56.550 --> 02:02.400
...and President Obama has given his consent and support towards this idea.

02:03.300 --> 02:08.400
Now, the US-Japan alliance, looking at it from the security front,...

02:09.600 --> 02:13.150
...naturally we have to cooperate in proliferation deterrence,...

02:13.400 --> 02:21.150
...on information protection, missile defense, and the use of outer space amongst others.

02:23.100 --> 02:29.250
We need to consider these new systems for issuing security...

02:29.700 --> 02:31.200
...and this is my thinking.

02:33.550 --> 02:37.700
But the US-Japan alliance is not just focused on security.

02:37.950 --> 02:45.700
For example, disaster prevention or health... education.

02:47.150 --> 02:50.700
We had many levels and also environmental issues as well.

02:51.450 --> 02:56.350
We need to cooperate in all these areas...

02:56.700 --> 03:02.000
...so as to cooperate in the Asia Pacific and others,...

03:02.200 --> 03:07.300
...so that we can further deepen our bilateral alliance.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.450
I believe that we have reached an agreement on these points.
