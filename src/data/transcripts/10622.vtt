00:02.500 --> 00:06.840
Ichiro has had three hits in this championship game.

00:07.740 --> 00:09.245
Two on, two out, tenth inning.

00:11.810 --> 00:12.720
Right through the middle.

00:14.780 --> 00:17.690
Uchikawa scores and right behind him, Iwamura.

00:18.180 --> 00:19.785
Ichiro will take second.

00:20.155 --> 00:22.600
And the big man comes through in the big game...

00:22.720 --> 00:24.355
...for Team Japan again.

00:26.290 --> 00:27.825
One ball and two strikes.

00:33.265 --> 00:37.105
Japan has won its second World Baseball Classic.

00:38.935 --> 00:41.820
Japan back-to-back. There's only been two. They won them both.

00:41.930 --> 00:44.175
Now, another very nice story at the start.

00:44.345 --> 00:48.400
Yeah, but they're not throwing their manager up at the end of this. That is the province of Japan.
