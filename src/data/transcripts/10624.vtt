Well, good evening. It is a great honor to be making my first trip to Japan...

00:06.450 --> 00:08.000
...as president of the United States.

00:08.700 --> 00:11.800
I have fond memories of visiting Japan in my youth.

00:11.850 --> 00:14.050
I've been looking forward to this trip for some time.

00:14.750 --> 00:17.850
I'm only sorry that Michelle and the girls could not join us.

00:18.500 --> 00:23.450
The girls have been studying Japan in school and so, they have a great interest in Japanese culture.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.450
And hopefully, I'll be able to bring them next time.

00:27.075 --> 00:32.700
I wanna thank the warm welcome that Prime Minister Hatoyama and the Japanese people have extended.

00:33.100 --> 00:36.100
I appreciate the graciousness with which you understood...

00:36.875 --> 00:40.550
...the delay that took place as a consequence of the tragedy at Fort Hood, Texas.

00:42.200 --> 00:46.650
Japan is my first stop as president in Asia.

00:47.750 --> 00:52.050
I began my trip here in Tokyo because the alliance between the United States and Japan...

00:52.100 --> 00:54.550
...is a foundation for security and prosperity,...

00:55.200 --> 00:58.400
...not just for our two countries but for the Asia Pacific region.

00:58.700 --> 01:02.950
In a few months, we'll be marking the 50th anniversary of our alliance,...

01:03.260 --> 01:08.000
...which is founded on shared values and shared interests that have served our people so well,...

01:08.750 --> 01:15.900
...and has provided peace and security for the region in an unprecedented way.

01:16.800 --> 01:20.150
That anniversary, as Prime Minister Hatoyama pointed out,...

01:20.200 --> 01:24.500
...represents an important opportunity to step back and reflect on what we've achieved,...

01:24.550 --> 01:31.400
...celebrate our friendship, but also find ways to renew this alliance and refresh it for the 21st century.

01:32.850 --> 01:37.700
Both Yukio and I were elected on the promise of change, but there should be no doubt,...

01:38.525 --> 01:40.450
...as we move our nations in a new direction,...

01:40.700 --> 01:41.950
...our alliance will endure...

01:42.400 --> 01:45.550
...and our efforts will be focused on revitalizing that friendship...

01:45.900 --> 01:50.150
...so that it's even stronger and more successful in meeting the challenges of the 21st century.

01:50.550 --> 01:57.300
It's essential for the United States, it's essential for Japan and it's essential for the Asia Pacific region.

01:58.350 --> 02:00.850
Throughout my trip and throughout my presidency,...

02:00.900 --> 02:04.350
...I intend to make clear that the United States is a Pacific nation,...

02:04.850 --> 02:07.800
...and we will be deepening our engagement in this part of the world.

02:08.400 --> 02:13.300
As I said to Prime Minister Hatoyama, the United States will strengthen our alliances,...

02:13.350 --> 02:14.600
...build new partnerships...

02:14.950 --> 02:18.550
...and we will be part of multilateral efforts and regional institutions,...

02:18.600 --> 02:21.650
...that advance regional security and prosperity.
