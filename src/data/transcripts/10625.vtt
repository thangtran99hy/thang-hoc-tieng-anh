Her name is Miranda Priestly.

00:11.100 --> 00:16.050
She is the most important woman in fashion in the world!

00:16.950 --> 00:18.750
Emily is her first assistant...

00:19.000 --> 00:22.350
...and we are looking for someone to be her second assistant!

00:23.350 --> 00:26.200
I knew nothing about fashion and I didn't care!

00:26.700 --> 00:29.550
So why did I suddenly want the job so much?

00:30.050 --> 00:32.700
Maybe because a million other girls wanted it too.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.700
This, Andy, is what you must wear.

00:37.250 --> 00:40.500
People around here don't like your high-street look.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.150
You're going to get fired if you're not careful.

00:43.700 --> 00:46.500
Look, I'm really sorry about the weekend...

00:47.000 --> 00:49.850
...but this job is going to open doors for me.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.200
Yes, it is important.

00:52.900 --> 00:59.500
Andrea, details and excuses, you know I don't like them.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.300
I hope this doesn't happen again. That's all.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.850
This was my life, my future.

01:07.350 --> 01:08.450
I couldn't leave now.

01:11.750 --> 01:13.550
Get me a glass of Pellegrino.
