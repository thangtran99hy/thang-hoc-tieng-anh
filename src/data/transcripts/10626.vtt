00:00.500 --> 00:05.350
We have to understand that the future of the United States and Asia is inextricably linked.

00:06.250 --> 00:08.600
The issues that matter most to our people.

00:08.950 --> 00:15.000
Issues of economic growth and job creation, non-proliferation, clean energy.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.950
These are all issues that have to be part of a joint agenda...

00:20.000 --> 00:23.900
...and we had very productive discussions about these issues this evening.
