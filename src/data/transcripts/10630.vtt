00:00.600 --> 00:03.300
This is an increasingly common sight in Kenya.

00:03.630 --> 00:07.520
Graveyards of what once were mighty forests, teeming with life.

00:08.005 --> 00:12.570
The Kakamega Forest in Western Kenya is one of the country's last remaining stands.

00:13.080 --> 00:17.935
Plants in the forest are being damaged or killed because people harvest them for traditional medicines.

00:18.315 --> 00:20.655
So, to save Kakamega Forest,...

00:20.950 --> 00:25.170
...an international research group has transferred two popular plants out of the forest...

00:25.295 --> 00:27.895
...and into the hands of farmers such as Mary Shimuli.

00:28.325 --> 00:32.255
Shimuli grows a half-acre's worth of Ocimum kilimandscharicum...

00:32.700 --> 00:35.335
...and harvests the plant every six months.

00:35.530 --> 00:38.143
She says that, besides saving the forest,...

00:38.349 --> 00:40.718
...her harvests bring her family a better income.

00:43.350 --> 00:48.280
I used to go to the forest for firewood but I was afraid of being arrested.

00:48.545 --> 00:51.615
After I realized that the project is fruitful for me,...

00:51.950 --> 00:53.720
...I stopped going to the forest.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.900
I managed to buy two cows.

00:56.790 --> 01:02.265
Shimuli and other farmers bring what they harvest to a nearby factory owned and operated by the community...

01:02.460 --> 01:06.665
...and supported by African Insect Science for Food and Health or ICIPE.

01:07.165 --> 01:10.170
The ocimum is weighed, dried, then processed.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.640
The oil extracted is used to manufacture Naturub,...

01:13.957 --> 01:16.279
...a balm and an ointment used to treat flu,...

01:16.415 --> 01:20.201
...cold, chest congestion, aches, pain and insect bites.

01:20.545 --> 01:23.298
The products have been certified and approved by the government.
