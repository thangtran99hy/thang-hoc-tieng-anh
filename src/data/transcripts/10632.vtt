00:00.950 --> 00:01.850
Now, let me be clear.

00:02.700 --> 00:09.200
There has never been an option before me that called for troop deployments before 2010.

00:09.900 --> 00:13.100
So, there has been no delay or denial of resources...

00:13.300 --> 00:17.200
...necessary for the conduct of the war during this review period.

00:19.100 --> 00:22.200
Instead, the review has allowed me to ask the hard questions...

00:22.850 --> 00:25.200
...and to explore all the different options...

00:25.350 --> 00:27.200
...along with my national security team,...

00:27.500 --> 00:31.900
...our military and civilian leadership in Afghanistan, and our key partners.

00:33.150 --> 00:38.300
And given the stakes involved, I owed the American people and our troops no less.

00:40.450 --> 00:41.700
This review is now complete.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.400
And as Commander in Chief,...

00:44.650 --> 00:48.200
...I have determined that it is in our vital national interest...

00:48.600 --> 00:51.950
...to send an additional 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.

00:53.850 --> 00:57.200
After 18 months, our troops will begin to come home.

00:58.650 --> 01:01.550
These are the resources that we need to seize the initiative,...

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
...while building the Afghan capacity that can allow for a responsible transition...

01:06.400 --> 01:09.150
...of our forces out of Afghanistan.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.900
I do not make this decision lightly.
