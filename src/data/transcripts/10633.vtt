What if when you pressed on, you were on the Internet in seconds?

00:04.350 --> 00:06.900
What if your browser was your operating system?

00:07.150 --> 00:08.000
And so check this out:...

00:08.050 --> 00:11.225
...This means that you don't have to deal with managing programs...

00:11.650 --> 00:15.750
...or nagging updates, or lost files, or confusing settings,...

00:15.800 --> 00:17.100
...or Blue Screens of Doom.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.300
And there are no nagging updates,...

00:19.600 --> 00:21.600
...just your browser.

00:21.700 --> 00:23.600
Which means you can still listen to music,...

00:23.650 --> 00:26.550
...you can watch movies, interact with friends, you're creating documents,...

00:26.650 --> 00:29.800
...you're playing games, you're writing your e-mails. You're doing all of this stuff...

00:29.850 --> 00:31.600
...that you're already doing on the Internet.

00:31.650 --> 00:34.600
But here's the thing, none of this is stored on your computer.

00:34.650 --> 00:35.850
What?! None of it, you ask?

00:35.900 --> 00:36.800
Yeah, none of it.

00:36.850 --> 00:37.650
Really nothing?

00:37.700 --> 00:40.050
Yeah, nothing is stored on your computer.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.000
Well, where is it?

00:42.650 --> 00:44.250
It's on the Internet.

00:44.450 --> 00:47.850
You know, like when you access your e-mails from your computer and your phone,...

00:47.900 --> 00:50.300
...the e-mail, it isn't stored on either device.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.000
So, if everything's stored on the Internet,...

00:52.050 --> 00:57.400
...then your phone, your computer, all of these devices are what people call, stateless.

00:57.750 --> 01:01.000
Which is kind of a big word so maybe just remember this:...

01:01.150 --> 01:03.650
...Chrome is a totally rethought Web browser,...

01:03.700 --> 01:05.700
...you could download it right now on your computer.

01:05.850 --> 01:09.100
But Chrome OS is a totally rethought computer...

01:09.150 --> 01:11.450
...that lets you stop worrying about your computer...

01:11.500 --> 01:13.500
...so you could focus on the Internet.

01:13.650 --> 01:18.250
Which is what most of us use our computers for nowadays, anyways.
