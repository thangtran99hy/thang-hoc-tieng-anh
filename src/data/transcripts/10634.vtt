00:02.130 --> 00:03.770
The stewardess seems to like you.

00:03.900 --> 00:05.800
She looks over here every five seconds.

00:06.740 --> 00:07.405
No.

00:07.540 --> 00:09.185
Five, four...

00:09.300 --> 00:09.835
Okay, stop.

00:10.125 --> 00:10.860
Can I get you anything?

00:11.210 --> 00:12.415
Maybe a bag of pretzels.

00:16.615 --> 00:18.080
Last night...

00:18.885 --> 00:19.520
...amazing.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.490
Oh my God! Well, I used to be a gymnast. Did I hurt you?

00:23.415 --> 00:26.625
It's not like I'm gonna sleep with one person for the rest of my life, right?

00:26.750 --> 00:27.580
I mean, who does that?

00:27.725 --> 00:28.995
Crazy people like us.

00:29.550 --> 00:30.445
Checking in for two.

00:30.930 --> 00:32.135
I mean, one and a dog.

00:32.295 --> 00:33.860
Oh, great! Happy Valentine's Day.

00:34.635 --> 00:35.035
You too.

00:49.315 --> 00:51.920
Love is the only shocking act left on the planet.

00:52.910 --> 00:54.120
I can't eat, Grandpa.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.455
What's the matter? Are you sick?

00:55.720 --> 00:56.565
Lovesick.

00:56.700 --> 00:57.990
You're gonna miss a good time tonight.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.290
Valentine's Day is about love, it's about romance, it's about...

01:06.965 --> 01:08.235
Valentine's Day.

01:08.500 --> 01:11.705
It's my fault that I'm alone on Valentine's Day.

01:11.840 --> 01:15.575
My closest relationship is with my Blackberry.

01:15.705 --> 01:16.110
Right.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.335
Thank God it vibrates!
