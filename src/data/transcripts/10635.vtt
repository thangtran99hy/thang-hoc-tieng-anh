00:00.750 --> 00:03.005
The prospect of fatherhood was just...

00:03.900 --> 00:06.405
...mind-boggling. I was terrified...

00:07.875 --> 00:09.175
...because I wasn't ready.

00:09.490 --> 00:12.510
I was not ready. I was 23 years old...

00:14.310 --> 00:18.685
...and just blown away. I mean, I'm like, 'Wow, this child is going to be...'

00:18.865 --> 00:20.485
I'm responsible for this kid.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.090
If we want our children to succeed in life,...

00:24.355 --> 00:25.725
...we need fathers to step up.

00:26.490 --> 00:29.860
We need fathers to understand that their work doesn't end...

00:30.260 --> 00:31.200
...with conception.

00:32.030 --> 00:35.835
What truly makes a man a father is the ability to...

00:36.400 --> 00:37.200
...raise a child.

00:37.475 --> 00:42.500
Personally, I will hold myself somewhat responsible and accountable...

00:42.610 --> 00:45.345
...for my child's actions when he grows to be an adult...

00:45.515 --> 00:46.910
...or when she grows to be an adult.

00:47.045 --> 00:51.165
So, I wanna make sure that they have all the tools and resources that they need...

00:51.250 --> 00:55.055
...to grow into their own personalities and do what they want to do.

00:55.865 --> 00:57.070
When my daughters were born,...

00:57.555 --> 01:00.160
...I made a pledge to them and to myself that I would...

01:00.625 --> 01:05.095
...do everything I could to give them some things I didn't have.

01:05.565 --> 01:08.435
I decided that if I could be one thing in life,...

01:08.700 --> 01:09.970
...it would be to be a good father.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.005
You need to understand...

01:14.140 --> 01:15.705
...what your child is going through,...

01:15.940 --> 01:17.310
...how they're going through...

01:17.745 --> 01:19.710
...whatever stage they are in their life.

01:20.615 --> 01:21.780
And then reaching out to them,...

01:22.080 --> 01:24.750
...getting on your hands and knees, getting at their level...

01:25.750 --> 01:28.455
...and letting them see you eye to eye.

01:29.220 --> 01:30.990
And it's just... try.

01:31.825 --> 01:35.795
Try. Keep trying, keep learning. Human nature. You learn.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.765
You keep learning throughout your whole life. So,...

01:39.400 --> 01:41.065
...use it as an opportunity...

01:41.500 --> 01:44.170
...and a challenge to learn more about each other.
