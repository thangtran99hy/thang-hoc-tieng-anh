Hi! I'm Steph.

00:04.900 --> 00:05.550
And I'm Greg.

00:05.650 --> 00:06.850
We're the Google Wave team.

00:07.300 --> 00:11.400
You know us, we're the people who made an 80-minute video to tell you about our product.

00:11.950 --> 00:14.800
Here's our attempt to tell you what Wave is in only 10 minutes.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.900
Don't be mad if we try to smoosh a lot in.

00:17.150 --> 00:18.650
Wave can do a lot of things.

00:19.100 --> 00:20.800
Wave was built in Sydney, Australia.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.850
Lars and Jens started the project.

00:23.100 --> 00:24.600
They helped create Google Maps.

00:24.850 --> 00:28.700
This is what computers look like when e-mail was invented more than 40 years ago.

00:29.150 --> 00:31.500
Technology has advanced pretty far since then.

00:31.850 --> 00:34.200
We took inspiration from all these innovations...

00:34.300 --> 00:37.550
....and tried to imagine what e-mail would look like if it were invented today.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.300
Out popped Wave.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.500
Here is how Wave is different from e-mail.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.150
When you send an e-mail, everyone gets a copy of the message.

00:46.300 --> 00:48.000
A Wave is a hosted conversation.

00:48.300 --> 00:51.000
There's one copy and anyone can contribute to it.

00:51.650 --> 00:55.400
This model allows you to do many types of communication and collaboration in one tool.
