00:00.200 --> 00:02.350
Let's say I wanna plan a barbecue with my friends.

00:03.050 --> 00:04.350
I'll create a new Wave...

00:06.150 --> 00:08.000
...and I'll add Greg as a participant.

00:08.750 --> 00:10.000
Greg opens the Wave.

00:11.500 --> 00:13.350
Greg can reply anywhere on the Wave.

00:18.600 --> 00:22.500
When I have the Wave open I can see what Greg types as he types it.

00:24.950 --> 00:26.500
I'll add Anna to the Wave.

00:28.450 --> 00:30.000
She can see everything we see.

00:30.600 --> 00:35.600
Because it's a hosted conversation, anyone on the Wave can edit any part of the Wave.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.700
You can see Greg and Anna editing right now.

00:44.750 --> 00:46.900
If I close the Wave and they keep editing it,...

00:47.050 --> 00:49.250
...their changes will be highlighted when I come back.

00:50.250 --> 00:53.500
Let's say I wanna invite my friends to the barbecue, I'll create a new Wave.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.100
I wanna know if they can attend so I'm going to add a Yes/No/Maybe Gadget to this Wave.

00:59.050 --> 01:02.450
Gadgets are a way to present and collect information other than text.

01:03.600 --> 01:06.300
Now, I'll add a group of my friends to the Wave, the Wavers.

01:10.550 --> 01:14.000
Everyone in the group can see the Wave when they are online and respond.

01:15.100 --> 01:16.900
You can see responses coming in now.

01:17.850 --> 01:19.900
Why does Dan always say no to my barbecues?

01:21.300 --> 01:23.200
If I wanna show people where the barbecue is,...

01:23.250 --> 01:25.550
...I can highlight the address and add a map.

01:26.650 --> 01:29.500
As I zoom in, you can see Greg's map changes too.

01:32.100 --> 01:34.050
Any developer can build these gadgets.
