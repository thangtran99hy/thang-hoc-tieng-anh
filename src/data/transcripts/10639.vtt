WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:04.900
People always wanna drag-and-drop files directly from their desktop into Web applications.

00:05.150 --> 00:06.400
With Wave, you can!

00:07.450 --> 00:09.500
Watch as Stephanie creates a new Wave...

00:10.050 --> 00:14.500
...and then, drag-and-drops a bunch of photos from iPhoto directly into Wave.

00:15.500 --> 00:19.700
Thumbnails will appear on my machine as soon as they start uploading on hers.

00:20.150 --> 00:24.200
I can then drag-and-drop photos from my machine directly into the Wave as well.

00:25.150 --> 00:28.400
You can see at the bottom of the screen there's an images menu.

00:28.550 --> 00:32.200
This menu allows you to operate on all of the images in the Wave...

00:32.250 --> 00:33.950
...not just the images you added.

00:34.300 --> 00:38.550
This is an easy and convenient way to make a collaborative photo album using Wave.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.200
Now that we have a Wave, with lots of images in it,...

00:42.250 --> 00:43.600
...we wanna share it with our friends.

00:44.250 --> 00:46.800
Drag our friend, "Bloggy" onto the Wave.

00:47.700 --> 00:50.700
This will publish the Wave on Steph's blog.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.800
Embedding is an easy way to put Waves directly into any website.

00:54.900 --> 00:57.500
Much the same way you can do with Maps today.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.200
Watch as I go to Steph's blog.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
You can see on Steph's blog that we embed the whole Wave, not just the images.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.300
This includes all of the UI.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.550
Watch as I leave a comment.

01:10.600 --> 01:15.400
Everything that I type on the blog immediately appears in Steph's Wave client.

01:15.450 --> 01:20.000
Steph can respond in her Wave client and her typing immediately appears on the blog.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.700
Since I contributed to the blog, the Wave will also show up in my Wave client,...

01:23.800 --> 01:25.750
...and we can continue the conversation from there.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.000
Embedding Waves is good for developers...

01:29.050 --> 01:31.900
...because it allows them to drop a rich, collaborative UI...

01:32.150 --> 01:34.100
...into websites with very little code.

01:34.300 --> 01:38.650
It's great for users because it allows them to have a consistent UI...

01:38.700 --> 01:41.900
...as well as every conversations they care about all in one place.
