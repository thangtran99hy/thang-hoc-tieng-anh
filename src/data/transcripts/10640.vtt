00:00.600 --> 00:04.350
The combination of collaborative editing and inline discussion...

00:04.600 --> 00:07.700
...makes Wave a powerful platform for document creation.

00:08.150 --> 00:11.300
I'll show you that by opening a design doc we wrote on our team.

00:12.500 --> 00:13.600
I'll make a little more room...

00:14.750 --> 00:17.150
...and you can see this has rich fonts,...

00:17.400 --> 00:19.700
...it has diagrams, it has inline discussion.

00:20.500 --> 00:24.000
The best way to view Wave when it's picked up a certain amount of structure...

00:24.100 --> 00:26.550
...is using a feature we built called, Playback.

00:28.300 --> 00:30.400
Playback tells you how the Wave built up.

00:30.850 --> 00:33.200
Steven, our trusted server guy wrote a draft.

00:33.600 --> 00:34.850
He added a bunch of people.

00:35.650 --> 00:38.200
Lars, the manager said, "It's a good start but needs more."

00:39.100 --> 00:40.300
Steven added more.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.800
I made some edits and so on.

00:43.450 --> 00:46.500
I can pick up the slider and move to any part of the Wave.

00:47.150 --> 00:51.200
Playback is a powerful way to investigate and manipulate the history of a Wave.
