WEBVTT

00:00.250 --> 00:04.700
Robots are pieces of software that can be added to a Wave like a participant...

00:04.900 --> 00:06.750
...and in fact, can act like a participant.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.150
They can do anything a person can do on the Wave.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.350
They can watch the typing that's going on.

00:11.550 --> 00:13.550
They can add other participants to the Wave.

00:13.750 --> 00:15.600
And in fact, they can even write into the Wave.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.150
Let me show you another extension to Wave...

00:18.200 --> 00:21.200
...that lets you interface to a different communication system.

00:21.500 --> 00:25.500
I'll start a new Wave and I'll add my friend, Tweety the Twitbot.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.550
As you can see, Tweety puts in a form.

00:28.950 --> 00:31.500
I'm gonna sign in with my Twitter username and password.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.750
Unfortunately, it's "Twephanie".

00:37.150 --> 00:39.900
When I submit that form, the robot notices it...

00:40.100 --> 00:44.800
...and goes, and uses Twitter's API to get updates from the people I follow.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.100
I can also put in my own update.

01:01.150 --> 01:05.500
Tweety notices that and uses the Twitter APIs to update my Twitter account.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.750
You can also use Tweety to search over the public timeline of Twitter.

01:10.400 --> 01:13.500
Imagine, there's a phrase I care a lot about, like Google Wave.

01:13.850 --> 01:15.150
I can enter it here...

01:16.650 --> 01:21.100
...and Tweety will use the API to pull in Tweets with that word in them.

01:21.550 --> 01:25.650
This way, you can use Tweety to be an alert or alarm for a phrase you care about.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.300
I can actually leave this Wave in my account...

01:28.500 --> 01:32.050
...and anytime there's a new match, this Wave will become active for me.

01:32.350 --> 01:34.200
I can open it and see the new content.

01:34.750 --> 01:37.600
Robots can be used to interface to other systems.

01:37.900 --> 01:41.400
In this case, it was Twitter but it could be anything with an API.
