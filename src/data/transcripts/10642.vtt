How good-looking is my wife?

00:04.235 --> 00:09.435
Not everyone was thrilled with the gown First Lady Michelle Obama wore to the Inaugural Balls...

00:09.975 --> 00:14.915
...but most fashion critics have been enthusiastic about her flair for fashion.

00:15.515 --> 00:16.880
That media attention...

00:17.215 --> 00:20.485
...reminds Mary Tomer of another First Lady.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.460
I think there is a certain way we feel about Michelle Obama...

00:23.585 --> 00:26.590
...that we haven't felt about a First Lady since Jacqueline Kennedy.

00:27.395 --> 00:30.145
That's what inspired Tomer to launch her blog,...

00:30.295 --> 00:31.130
"Mrs. O".

00:31.430 --> 00:33.485
It led to the publication of her book,...

00:33.865 --> 00:37.135
..."Mrs. O: The Face of Fashion Democracy".

00:37.735 --> 00:40.370
The blog features an update nearly every day...

00:40.670 --> 00:43.630
...with what the First Lady was last seen wearing.

00:43.910 --> 00:46.045
It averages 10,000 hits a day...

00:46.210 --> 00:49.215
...with visitors from more than 200 countries.

00:49.615 --> 00:51.850
And I think they're just inspired to see a very...

00:52.010 --> 00:53.720
...kind of modern, fashion forward,...

00:53.920 --> 00:56.995
...normal woman in this fantastic role on platform.
