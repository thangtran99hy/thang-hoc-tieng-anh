Google's very interested in improving the speed of the Web.

00:08.950 --> 00:11.950
Because the Web is the most important platform of our time.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.850
And by making the Web better and faster,...

00:14.950 --> 00:17.450
...we not only make Google applications better...

00:17.500 --> 00:20.600
...but in fact, all the applications users know and love.

00:20.700 --> 00:27.600
We also believe that people are using the Web more and more as a place to read, view videos...

00:27.650 --> 00:29.850
In order for that information to be useful,...

00:29.900 --> 00:32.900
...we need to make sure that it is delivered in a timely fashion.

00:33.300 --> 00:37.450
You know, I think we're just at the beginning of how fast we can make the Web.

00:37.800 --> 00:42.350
It's hard for us to imagine the improvements that we've made just in the last 15 years,...

00:42.400 --> 00:45.700
...if you think about how slow the Web was when it initially started...

00:45.850 --> 00:47.100
...and how far we've come.

00:47.250 --> 00:52.400
Larry Page expressed a vision of being able to go from Web page to Web page...

00:52.450 --> 00:57.700
...as quickly as you could turn the pages in a glossy magazine.

00:57.850 --> 01:00.900
Uploading pictures, watching high-definition movies,...

01:01.200 --> 01:03.600
...running very complex Javascript-based apps.

01:03.850 --> 01:07.700
All those things can and should be instantaneous in the future.
