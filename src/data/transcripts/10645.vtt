00:00.275 --> 00:03.091
Making the entire Web faster is a big challenge.

00:03.245 --> 00:06.642
And although Google is a major player in the Internet,...

00:06.862 --> 00:09.470
...it cannot move the entire Internet on its own.

00:09.697 --> 00:11.894
We all collectively have to work together.

00:12.223 --> 00:15.484
And Google is very interested in helping move those initiatives forward.

00:16.064 --> 00:19.124
Helping software developers write applications that are faster.

00:19.525 --> 00:22.875
Helping ISPs understand what's limiting their networks.

00:23.173 --> 00:25.817
We also plan to work with standards for these...

00:26.150 --> 00:30.651
...to make the Web protocols more speed-friendly than what they are today.

00:31.053 --> 00:34.331
If we could come up with changes,...

00:35.233 --> 00:40.161
...enhancements or even alternatives to TCP/IP or HTTP.

00:41.550 --> 00:44.593
You know, that might have a significant impact.

00:44.742 --> 00:46.451
And we'll have to advocate for it.

00:46.618 --> 00:52.651
We'll have to explain, talk about, educate users, educate other companies...

00:53.612 --> 00:54.447
...and work towards it.

00:54.527 --> 00:59.617
So this will be a series of difficult advocacy steps over a long period of time.
