Making the Web faster is important not just to Google...

00:04.300 --> 00:06.550
...but we believe it's important to everybody.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.450
The Web has become the dominant competing platform of our time.

00:11.275 --> 00:14.150
It's the platform by which people communicate socially.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.250
It's the way we exchange ideas.

00:16.300 --> 00:19.500
It's the platform that runs the applications we care most about.

00:20.050 --> 00:24.400
And by making the Web as fast as it can be, we think the whole world benefits.

00:24.750 --> 00:26.800
I think the most immediate impact will be...

00:26.900 --> 00:31.150
...the number of people using the Web will just increase dramatically.

00:31.200 --> 00:37.150
You're gonna see more high-speed and faster performing phones...

00:37.400 --> 00:39.700
...and mobile devices in people's hands.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.300
New markets can form.

00:41.650 --> 00:44.450
People will be making purchasing decisions on-the-spot,...

00:44.800 --> 00:49.500
...instead of, you know, going back home and sitting down at their computer.

00:49.850 --> 00:54.550
So, there are a lot of, I think, future benefits to be had.

00:54.925 --> 01:00.500
And I think the world can really benefit from having information access faster.

01:00.900 --> 01:07.850
We should also hold out as a goal, as an aspiration for what we could achieve...

01:07.900 --> 01:09.700
...by making the Internet a faster place...

01:09.950 --> 01:12.300
...is raising the quality of life around the world.
