Hi, my name is Matt Cutts and I work in Google Search Quality Group.

00:06.750 --> 00:10.550
Today, I'm gonna tell you a bit about how Google Social Search works.

00:10.750 --> 00:16.150
Google Social Search is a new experiment to help you find publicly available Web content...

00:16.500 --> 00:20.850
...from your social circle quickly and more easily in Google Search.

00:21.100 --> 00:23.500
First, let me give you some context.

00:24.150 --> 00:28.650
Today on the Internet, people have many different places where they make social connections...

00:28.850 --> 00:34.750
...and publish web content like blogs, status updates, Tweets and pictures.

00:35.250 --> 00:39.550
People choose to publish much of this content publicly for everyone to see.

00:40.150 --> 00:44.250
For example, I have a Twitter account where I follow more than a hundred people.

00:45.150 --> 00:50.250
Anyone browsing on the Web today can visit my Twitter page and see the Tweets I've been writing.

00:50.400 --> 00:54.300
Anyone can also see the list of people I'm following on Twitter.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.800
I also write a public blog, and have a FriendFeed account.

00:58.250 --> 01:03.000
These various online social services create an implicit network of connections...

01:03.250 --> 01:05.400
...which we like to call, your social circle.

01:06.100 --> 01:09.200
For example, I'm following Leo Laporte on Twitter,...

01:10.250 --> 01:12.600
...and on FriendFeed, I follow Danny Sullivan.

01:13.850 --> 01:15.950
There's also an extended social circle...

01:16.100 --> 01:18.950
...which is the set of people that Leo and Danny follow.

01:19.650 --> 01:22.400
With Google Social Search, we've managed to pull...

01:22.450 --> 01:26.200
...different pieces of your public social circle together in a single place.
