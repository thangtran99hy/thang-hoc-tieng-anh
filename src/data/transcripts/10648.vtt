Now that you know the basic terminology, how does Google know your social circle?

00:04.500 --> 00:08.450
Let me give you a mental model of how our social search works.

00:09.250 --> 00:14.150
Right now, we surface social content that we find in three different ways.

00:14.300 --> 00:18.650
The first way and the biggest in my mind is your public Google profile.

00:19.100 --> 00:24.750
A Google profile is just a place where you can choose to share information about yourself with the world...

00:25.150 --> 00:28.600
...including a list of your different online social services.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.800
For example, you can add a link to your Twitter account,...

00:32.050 --> 00:36.050
...your FriendFeed account, your blog or your Picasa albums.

00:37.300 --> 00:41.450
Bear in mind, it's your choice whether or not to create a Google profile...

00:41.700 --> 00:45.200
...and you can always add or remove any information from it.

00:45.450 --> 00:50.550
Once you've created a Google profile and added links to your various online social services,...

00:50.950 --> 00:56.000
...you've signalled a very clear choice that you're comfortable with the world knowing that information.

00:56.350 --> 00:59.600
Including that you're part of the other social networks you list there.

01:00.050 --> 01:05.200
Based on this opt-in decision, Google can start building a broader social graph.

01:05.750 --> 01:08.700
For example, take the link to my public Twitter account,...

01:09.250 --> 01:12.400
...Google can fetch my Twitter page, just like any web surfer...

01:12.650 --> 01:15.500
...and see that I'm following about a 180 people.

01:15.800 --> 01:19.100
Google will add these 180 people to my social circle.

01:19.700 --> 01:23.650
We also crawl one step further to build out your extended network.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.900
For example, if I'm following my best friend...

01:27.150 --> 01:29.300
...and he's following five different people,...

01:29.850 --> 01:33.150
...Google will add those five people to my extended social circle.

01:33.450 --> 01:37.450
Since it's likely that some of them will be connections of mine as well.
