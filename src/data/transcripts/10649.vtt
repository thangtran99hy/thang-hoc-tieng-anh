00:00.050 --> 00:02.650
The second way for us to add to your social circle...

00:02.950 --> 00:04.700
...is from your Google chat buddies.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.500
If you have eight chat buddies,...

00:06.650 --> 00:09.200
...we'll add those eight people to your social graph.

00:09.400 --> 00:12.750
It's important to know that we don't publish your list of chat buddies,...

00:13.000 --> 00:14.800
...we just add them to your social circle...

00:15.000 --> 00:17.200
...so we can show you their public information.

00:17.450 --> 00:21.600
The third way, we surface content from your social circle is through Google Reader.

00:21.950 --> 00:24.750
For example, if you subscribe to a blog in Google Reader,...

00:25.050 --> 00:28.400
...then we can surface a post from that blog in your social search results.

00:29.300 --> 00:33.300
Once Google builds your social circle, things are pretty simple after that.

00:34.300 --> 00:38.500
We take our regular Web index data and annotate it with social information.

00:38.950 --> 00:42.850
When our algorithms determine that it would improve your search experience,...

00:43.200 --> 00:48.000
...we surface public content from your social circle at the bottom of the search results.
