The last thing you need to know is that you have control.

00:03.550 --> 00:05.050
If you're not signed in to Google,...

00:05.350 --> 00:07.850
...you won't see all the social search goodness.

00:08.150 --> 00:10.800
It's important to know that you always have control...

00:11.000 --> 00:13.600
...over both your connections and your content.

00:14.500 --> 00:18.950
As a user, you can always add or delete links on your Google profile...

00:19.400 --> 00:22.150
...just like you can defriend someone on a social networking site.

00:22.450 --> 00:26.100
You can also add or block your Google Chat contacts,...

00:26.400 --> 00:28.550
...so you won't receive social search results from them.

00:28.950 --> 00:32.700
And as a content creator, you can choose what content to make public...

00:32.950 --> 00:36.350
...and which public content to be associated with your Google profile.

00:36.500 --> 00:40.000
We hope this helps you understand how Google builds your social circle...

00:40.300 --> 00:42.397
...and then, finds useful public information...

00:42.480 --> 00:45.337
...from your network of contacts to show in search results.

00:45.900 --> 00:47.100
The main thing to remember...

00:47.350 --> 00:51.200
...is that Google social search makes your results more relevant.
