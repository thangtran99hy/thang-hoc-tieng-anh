00:04.400 --> 00:09.455
US President Barack Obama is sending 30,000 more US troops to Afghanistan.

00:09.575 --> 00:12.310
They should all be there by about the middle of 2010,...

00:12.445 --> 00:16.130
...but he also plans to start withdrawing American forces a year later.

00:16.750 --> 00:21.815
In a previous edition of "Now You Know", we took a look at the threat posed by the Taliban...

00:22.055 --> 00:23.155
...in Afghanistan.

00:23.990 --> 00:27.325
It's a resurgent Taliban in large parts of Afghanistan.

00:27.460 --> 00:31.395
I've seen estimates that they control as much as 60%,...

00:31.530 --> 00:33.065
...if not more of the country.

00:33.265 --> 00:39.155
Taliban, the word means, "students", students of Islam. Their Islamic religious schools are called, "madrasahs".

00:39.280 --> 00:44.375
Many young men and boys fled Afghanistan during the war with the Soviets in the 1980s,...

00:44.645 --> 00:48.015
...ending up in madrasahs in mostly northwest Pakistan.

00:48.180 --> 00:51.785
These youngsters are being taught that Islam is under threat,...

00:51.985 --> 00:55.855
...which is the philosophy of those schools and that Islam needs to be defended,...

00:55.955 --> 00:58.525
...and that these youngsters have a role to play.

00:58.690 --> 01:05.430
These madrasahs are the principal production centers, if you wanna call it that...

01:05.765 --> 01:07.230
...of the suicide bombers.

01:07.465 --> 01:12.880
The end of the war with the Soviets did not bring peace and stability to Afghanistan, just more wars,...

01:12.955 --> 01:15.820
...civil war, and an almost total lack of law and order.

01:15.960 --> 01:19.045
In that vacuum, you had these warlords stepping in...

01:19.410 --> 01:24.050
...and these warlords were committing terrible atrocities: murder, rape, killing and looting.

01:24.170 --> 01:29.335
It was the Taliban that promised to bring law and order to Afghanistan in the mid-1990s.

01:29.485 --> 01:32.460
Mullah Mohammed Omar emerged as leader of the Taliban...

01:32.635 --> 01:36.170
...after he ordered an Afghan warlord hanged for rape.

01:36.275 --> 01:40.245
That act of him, executing the commander for that kidnapping and rape...

01:41.100 --> 01:45.490
...is what immediately started to form a following around him.

01:45.640 --> 01:50.575
There was chaos and the Taliban promised to bring an end to it.

01:51.220 --> 01:52.415
And they did.
