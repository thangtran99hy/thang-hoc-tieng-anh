You don't like people calling you that you are like, you look like Beyonce. Why is that?

00:06.100 --> 00:10.550
Because I think, it's, I mean, it's nice to hear it. It's a big compliment.

00:11.150 --> 00:15.000
And I think she's a big artist. Of course, she is.

00:15.400 --> 00:18.200
But I don't like it when people compare me with other names,...

00:18.250 --> 00:21.650
...because it just feels like I'm a copy of that person,...

00:22.150 --> 00:25.900
...which I'm not, because I'm not a copy of anybody else.

00:25.950 --> 00:29.400
If I would do that I would be, you know, lying to myself...

00:29.450 --> 00:32.200
...and not being who I am as an artist, as a person.

00:33.050 --> 00:37.400
I'm just being who I am and I think, I'm just doing my thing,...

00:37.550 --> 00:40.500
...and I respect that people say things.

00:40.650 --> 00:46.700
I think, it's natural that people start comparing you with the biggest artists in the world,...

00:46.950 --> 00:48.950
...so I respect it.

00:50.300 --> 00:54.000
And at this show, I also... I listened to your album,...

00:54.450 --> 00:58.600
...and your songs are really original and distinctive,...

00:58.800 --> 01:04.050
...and that you seem to, sort of integrate the good parts...

01:04.100 --> 01:08.300
...of both Eastern music, Turkish music and Western music.

01:08.550 --> 01:10.700
You think that's your intention?

01:10.800 --> 01:13.250
Yes, it is because it's actually who I am.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.600
It's in my blood. It's where I come from.

01:15.900 --> 01:19.300
And I got the two cultures mixed in my soul.

01:19.750 --> 01:23.100
And, I mean, I have a story to tell.

01:23.150 --> 01:26.600
I'm a girl who has Turkish roots. I have Turkish parents.

01:26.900 --> 01:30.000
I really stick to my traditions as a Turkish girl...

01:30.050 --> 01:32.850
..but I also, I mean, I was born in a Western country.

01:33.200 --> 01:40.250
Like Belgium where I grew up, where I got my degree, where I got my friends.

01:40.450 --> 01:48.850
So, it's a nice feeling to combine the two things that inspire me as a person.

01:48.900 --> 01:53.050
And it's all about me. It's who I am and I'm not hiding anything.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.750
So, it's actually my story, yeah.

01:56.350 --> 02:02.000
So with your songs, do you think you want to sort of represent the positive side of,...

02:02.050 --> 02:04.600
...you know, both of your cultures in a way?

02:05.100 --> 02:10.650
Yes, definitely because you know, every country has its advantages and disadvantages.

02:10.750 --> 02:18.100
And I just wanna show people that you can, you know, you can be... you could be who you wanna be...

02:18.150 --> 02:22.050
...and it doesn't matter where you're from, or what you do or what color of hair you have.

02:22.550 --> 02:26.700
I mean, it doesn't matter and you just have to be positive every day.
