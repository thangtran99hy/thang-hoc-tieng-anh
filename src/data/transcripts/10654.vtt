00:00.500 --> 00:03.150
But you've been doing it for so long that...

00:04.500 --> 00:09.100
...obviously, people know you from this show as well as from work on NHK and the radio.

00:09.150 --> 00:09.600
Oh, yeah!

00:10.650 --> 00:12.400
What's the feedback you get from people on the street?

00:13.300 --> 00:14.100
People like the show.

00:14.150 --> 00:16.450
The people that know about it generally like it.

00:16.500 --> 00:20.850
I don't think I've ever met anybody that watches the show and doesn't like it.

00:21.100 --> 00:26.250
Well, a lot of people don't go out of their way to talk about shows they don't like...

00:26.300 --> 00:26.750
That's true.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.350
...to the entertainer who's on the show.

00:29.100 --> 00:31.950
Although, I got a couple of... you tell him that...

00:32.200 --> 00:40.350
I got a couple of... weeks ago, I got an e-mail written on to my blog, my Facebook page,...

00:41.800 --> 00:46.450
...someone who wrote in says, "I watch your show all the time, you need to get a better stylist."

00:55.900 --> 00:56.600
Well, thank you.

00:58.600 --> 01:02.000
Actually, she didn't say better stylist. She said, "You need to get better clothes."

01:02.050 --> 01:05.950
And I'm like, "I have someone getting those clothes for me, I'll pass on the information."

01:06.600 --> 01:09.100
But yeah. Occasionally, people do give me pointers.

01:10.750 --> 01:12.500
But, I mean, I've had basically nothing but praise about,...

01:12.875 --> 01:15.900
...which is hardly surprising because it is just such good material.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.950
I mean, the show has been running in America for over 40 years...

01:19.450 --> 01:22.450
...and on prime time, a prime time on a Sunday evening.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.850
So obviously, we've got to be doing something right.

01:24.900 --> 01:28.750
It's the same slot as Sanma-no-karakuri-terebi, desune? Here in Japan.

01:28.800 --> 01:32.000
Alright, okay. Yeah, okay. We're not gonna compete with that.

01:33.100 --> 01:37.700
At least, we used to be on Sunday nights at half past 12 or something.

01:37.950 --> 01:39.800
Oh, really? In America?

01:40.050 --> 01:41.950
No, no. Oh, In America it's seven to eight on Sunday.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.800
Exactly! So it's the same as Sanma-san here in Japan.

01:44.850 --> 01:45.200
Yeah.
