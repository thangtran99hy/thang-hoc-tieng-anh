00:00.300 --> 00:02.100
Yeah, so that's a huge slot...

00:02.600 --> 00:06.100
...and it's one of the most famous shows in America. And it certainly,...

00:06.300 --> 00:09.000
...I think, the longest running perhaps or the least out there.

00:09.050 --> 00:12.800
Probably. I mean, actually, we've got a piece coming up...

00:13.300 --> 00:15.475
...in a few weeks time about a show called Guiding Light,...

00:15.584 --> 00:16.728
...which I've never even heard of.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.900
The Hirudora. Yeah!

00:19.100 --> 00:22.150
And that's been running since the days of radio. 72 years.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.100
Although, it's about to get axed...

00:24.223 --> 00:25.075
...or in fact, I think,...

00:25.149 --> 00:28.135
...it already has finished at the end of September or something in America.

00:28.150 --> 00:28.900
Really?

00:29.050 --> 00:32.450
Because the sponsors finally pulled out, because of dropping ratings.

00:32.650 --> 00:34.550
Oh! The lights going out?

00:34.600 --> 00:35.050
Yup.

00:36.850 --> 00:40.200
Wow! So, what are they gonna do for the Michishirube? That's gonna be tough.

00:40.400 --> 00:41.550
What are they gonna be guided by?

00:42.500 --> 00:43.423
You know, that's a huge show.

00:43.499 --> 00:46.807
I remember people watch that, you know, I mean, religiously.

00:47.550 --> 00:49.450
At least, they used to.

00:50.650 --> 00:51.850
Evidently, not anymore.

00:51.900 --> 00:54.200
Yeah! Guess what? As The World Turns...

00:54.250 --> 00:59.150
...and General Hospital, these are the big afternoon soap operas.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.350
And they run every day, right?

01:00.650 --> 01:05.900
Yes! Yeah and you know, the plots are bizarre.

01:05.950 --> 01:08.100
You have to read like... If you don't watch for a couple of days,...

01:08.150 --> 01:10.500
...you have to read like a manual to figure out what's going on.

01:10.633 --> 01:13.664
'Cause, you know, it's like, you know, Bob's girlfriend,...

01:14.530 --> 01:18.080
...Samantha is actually the daughter of Bob's wife, Martha.

01:18.100 --> 01:22.700
But they didn't know, because Martha's twin sister was actually flirting with Bob...

01:22.891 --> 01:24.586
...and then, she switched places with Martha before, you know,...

01:24.791 --> 01:27.105
...before she got abducted by the alien in a coma.

01:27.050 --> 01:31.250
You know, it's really intricate stuff...

01:31.350 --> 01:35.300
...but people follow it religiously like I said, so they know what's going on.

01:35.350 --> 01:38.350
And I, you know, I turned on to watch for like 10 minutes and I can't... never mind.
