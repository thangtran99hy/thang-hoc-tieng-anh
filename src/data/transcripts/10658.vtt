00:01.400 --> 00:03.900
Welcome to Aera English TV's Native Maestro.

00:04.150 --> 00:05.700
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:06.350 --> 00:09.750
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.450
In the States, we have a strange gesture we do with business cards.

00:15.250 --> 00:17.900
When we get a business card from somebody, we look and we say,...

00:18.700 --> 00:20.650
..."Oh! I know this person."

00:21.750 --> 00:23.250
We smack the business card.

00:24.100 --> 00:26.350
Of course, in Japan, this is unbelievable.

00:26.700 --> 00:29.900
But when a foreigner does it to you, please don't be insulted.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.250
Okay, today's topic...

00:50.700 --> 00:53.500
Excuse me, do you mind if I cut in?

00:54.600 --> 00:56.750
Excuse me, do you mind if I cut in?

01:06.800 --> 01:08.800
Excuse me, do you mind if I cut in?

01:12.300 --> 01:13.050
Please use it.

01:14.100 --> 01:14.900
And next,...

01:16.950 --> 01:19.350
...Sir, with all due respect.

01:25.950 --> 01:27.050
With all due respect.

01:30.950 --> 01:33.150
Sir, with all due respect.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.800
Ma'am, with all due respect.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.700
So, use this kind of English and you can cut in, in a business situation.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.050
Let's practice.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.950
Excuse me, do you mind if I cut in?

01:50.850 --> 01:51.600
Please repeat.

01:54.050 --> 01:54.500
Good!

01:58.100 --> 01:58.800
And next,...

01:59.600 --> 02:01.850
...Sir, with all due respect.

02:02.800 --> 02:03.550
Please repeat.

02:06.300 --> 02:06.700
Good!

02:11.400 --> 02:13.500
Okay. And that's it for today.

02:13.650 --> 02:18.550
And next week, there'll be more English to help you become the native maestro. Bye-bye.
