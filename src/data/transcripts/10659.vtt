Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:04.300 --> 00:05.850
I am your maitre d' Seita.

00:06.550 --> 00:09.950
This program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:10.900 --> 00:15.200
By the way, the most famous movie phrase of all time is...

00:15.900 --> 00:16.850
..."I'll be back."

00:17.750 --> 00:18.650
You know the movie, right?

00:19.250 --> 00:22.800
This is Terminator, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the California governor.

00:23.700 --> 00:27.850
Okay, the second most popular movie phrase of all time is this,...

00:28.550 --> 00:31.000
..."Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn."

00:31.900 --> 00:32.950
Do you know what this movie is?

00:33.950 --> 00:36.450
Yes, a lot of people know it and so should you.

00:36.950 --> 00:40.350
This movie is Rhett Butler in Gone With The Wind.

00:41.050 --> 00:42.700
A little bit of trivia, I thought you should know.

00:43.650 --> 00:45.850
Okay, today's class...

01:06.350 --> 01:07.200
Get out of here!

01:17.800 --> 01:18.700
Get out of here!

01:30.450 --> 01:31.900
Wow! Get out of here!

01:36.350 --> 01:37.750
So, practice a set phrase.

01:44.550 --> 01:45.950
Wouldn't that be something!

01:46.600 --> 01:47.750
Wouldn't that be something.

01:54.050 --> 01:55.100
Wouldn't that be something.

02:00.450 --> 02:02.000
I think that's Brad Pitt.

02:03.350 --> 02:05.100
Wow! Wouldn't that be something?

02:11.300 --> 02:12.250
Wouldn't that be something.

02:18.550 --> 02:19.950

02:25.450 --> 02:26.350

02:32.850 --> 02:35.700
Second one, wouldn't that be something.

02:36.250 --> 02:37.450
Wouldn't that be something!

02:40.100 --> 02:41.500
Wouldn't that be something.

02:44.500 --> 02:46.000
Alright, please practice.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.700
Okay, that's it for today.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.550
