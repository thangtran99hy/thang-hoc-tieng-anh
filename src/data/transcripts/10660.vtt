Hello! Welcome to Michael's Business Top Tips.

00:05.100 --> 00:07.500
This month, we're looking at mind mapping.

00:08.300 --> 00:14.100
Now, this is an easy and great technique you can use for a variety of business situations.

00:14.700 --> 00:16.750
How does it work? Very simple.

00:17.450 --> 00:24.000
First, you put the topic or issue, or situation in the center of a page or on a whiteboard.

00:24.300 --> 00:26.700
So, for example, let's take marketing.

00:34.550 --> 00:36.500
Then, you draw a circle around it.

00:36.750 --> 00:41.300
And then, you brainstorm other ideas or topics connected with this.

00:41.650 --> 00:44.850
For example, maybe TV commercials...

00:45.450 --> 00:49.700
...or maybe magazine articles, or commercial adverts,...

00:50.350 --> 00:51.900
...or maybe Internet.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.900
Then, the next step is to further brainstorm ideas.

00:59.250 --> 01:03.100
So these could be maybe by sending e-mails to customers...

01:03.500 --> 01:06.950
...or maybe again advertising, et cetera.

01:08.350 --> 01:13.100
This is so useful because it is a very quick way to generate ideas.

01:13.950 --> 01:17.150
A nice variant on this is to use Post-its.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.950
If you're doing a brainstorming meeting,...

01:20.600 --> 01:23.950
...try having the people each write one idea on a Post-it.

01:24.700 --> 01:30.200
Then, put the Post-its on the whiteboard and organize using this mind mapping structure.

01:31.500 --> 01:36.600
This is a very quick and easy way to get lots of ideas and then, organizing clearly.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.800
Mind mapping can be used for brainstorming.

01:40.050 --> 01:41.800
It can be used for notes taking.

01:42.050 --> 01:43.850
It can be used for problem solving.

01:44.300 --> 01:45.900
Many different situations.

01:46.400 --> 01:50.200
I always use it when I'm writing my AERA English articles...

01:50.300 --> 01:51.500
...and it helps me a lot.

01:52.800 --> 01:58.200
Okay. Next month, we're gonna look at an issue that's key to many people, time management.

01:58.750 --> 01:59.400
See you then!
