00:02.730 --> 00:08.805
Lawmakers in the United States are considering financial reform legislation for large institutions.

00:08.975 --> 00:13.015
Among the ideas being considered is to set up an oversight council.

00:13.210 --> 00:19.020
One that would identify and monitor the so-called, "Too Big to Fail" enterprises.

00:19.320 --> 00:24.795
Large firms such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo...

00:24.945 --> 00:27.395
...would be subjected to greater regulation.

00:27.660 --> 00:32.635
It'll be a series of different yardsticks that have to do with their assets...

00:33.030 --> 00:34.100
...and their liabilities.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.775
And it'll be the relationship between those two.

00:37.100 --> 00:39.905
And it'll be the kinds of assets they have,...

00:40.040 --> 00:41.840
...and the kinds of liabilities they have.

00:42.175 --> 00:45.660
The largest institutions worth tens of billions of dollars...

00:45.810 --> 00:49.215
...might be asked to contribute to a federal dissolution fund,...

00:49.395 --> 00:53.255
...that would be used for potential future financial firm bailouts.

00:53.620 --> 00:58.275
And those institutions might be asked to keep more money in their reserves.

00:58.630 --> 01:02.402
Another idea under consideration would give regulators the ability...

01:02.446 --> 01:05.034
...to dismantle large financial groups,...

01:05.142 --> 01:08.195
...that might be in trouble or are on the verge of collapse.

01:08.335 --> 01:13.050
Such has happened to Lehman Brothers, and insurer American International Group.

01:13.440 --> 01:17.475
John Maggs covers the economy and taxes for the National Journal.

01:17.710 --> 01:21.210
Think of it as a kind of, you know, bankruptcy process for financial firms.

01:22.045 --> 01:25.250
There was no such procedure in place during this recent crisis,...

01:25.385 --> 01:27.220
...so they were making it up as they went along.
