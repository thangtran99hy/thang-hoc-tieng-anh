00:00.550 --> 00:04.350
All cancers are caused by changes in the DNA of cells.

00:04.650 --> 00:07.700
DNA carries the cells' genetic information.

00:08.100 --> 00:12.485
And that information changes when some cells gradually mutate,...

00:12.615 --> 00:16.961
...from normal to abnormal, and then to malignant, over time.

00:17.600 --> 00:22.100
Scientists say if they could only crack the genetic codes of different types of cancers,...

00:22.450 --> 00:24.500
...they could save millions of lives.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.500
Blood tests could spot tumors early on.

00:27.850 --> 00:30.350
And treatment would be far more successful.

00:30.750 --> 00:36.650
Dr. Jeanny Aragon-Ching is an oncologist at the George Washington University Medical Center.

00:37.100 --> 00:41.750
She says this discovery is a step toward an era of personalized medicine.

00:42.100 --> 00:44.837
That is the thrust now because,...

00:45.261 --> 00:48.431
...for instance, for cancers, specific types of cancers,...

00:48.500 --> 00:54.900
...we have different drugs that target specific domains or mutations.

00:55.150 --> 00:58.950
The more information doctors have about how cancer cells develop,...

00:59.300 --> 01:04.000
...the more precisely they can prescribe a treatment to target those particular cells.

01:04.600 --> 01:08.500
British scientists found 30,000 mutations in melanoma,...

01:08.800 --> 01:13.450
...a type of skin cancer that accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.

01:14.050 --> 01:18.450
They also found 23,000 mutations in small-cell lung cancer.

01:18.900 --> 01:21.700
But not all of these mutations cause cancer.

01:22.367 --> 01:25.907
It is the role of physicians and scientists...

01:26.159 --> 01:30.878
...to find out which of those mutations are the driving force,...

01:31.200 --> 01:35.500
...or the driving mutation that actually led to the cancer.

01:35.750 --> 01:39.500
Eventually, scientists might be able to target precancerous cells...

01:39.800 --> 01:42.050
...and prevent deadly tumors from forming.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.550
But that day is still far away.

01:45.087 --> 01:46.818
As an oncologist,...

01:47.211 --> 01:55.458
...my goal would be to one day see that we can transform cancer into a chronic disease.

01:55.850 --> 02:01.850
Okay, certainly cure but cure is probably too generous of a word the way I see it,...

02:02.250 --> 02:07.700
...but to convert it to something more like chronic disease that can be treatable.
