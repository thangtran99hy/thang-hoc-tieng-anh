For the Obama family, Christmas and the New Year has always been a time...

00:05.460 --> 00:07.717
...to reflect on our many blessings...

00:07.791 --> 00:12.014
...to rejoice in the pleasure of spending time with our family and our friends,...

00:12.333 --> 00:17.515
...and to renew our commitment to one another, and to the causes that we believe in.

00:18.122 --> 00:20.647
And I wanted to continue that part of the tradition...

00:20.758 --> 00:23.556
...during our first holiday season here at the White House,...

00:23.793 --> 00:26.560
...which is as we always say, the people's house.

00:33.675 --> 00:36.811
Our starting point was a very simple idea...

00:37.337 --> 00:43.668
...that we include as many people, in as many places, in as many ways as we can.

00:45.581 --> 00:50.725
We took about 800 ornaments leftover from previous administrations.

00:50.973 --> 00:54.687
We sent them to 60 local community groups throughout the country...

00:55.230 --> 00:59.453
...and asked them to decorate them to pay tribute to a favorite local landmark,...

00:59.815 --> 01:04.125
...and then, send them back to us for display here at the White House.

01:05.331 --> 01:08.873
Thanks to the East Wing and residence staff,...

01:09.322 --> 01:12.399
...and 92 volunteers from 24 states...

01:12.492 --> 01:17.455
...who spent more than 3,400 hours decorating over the last several days.

01:17.887 --> 01:23.162
We opened the doors last night to the first of more than 50,000 visitors...

01:23.466 --> 01:26.625
...who will come to the White House during this holiday season,...

01:26.973 --> 01:30.824
...and it's safe to say that everyone was really impressed.

01:35.619 --> 01:40.058
For many people, a visit to the White House is a once in a lifetime experience...

01:40.132 --> 01:45.345
...and it has been made even more magical because of all of your hard work.

01:46.960 --> 01:52.390
In the New Year, we all intend to renew this effort and continue this kind of outreach,...

01:52.883 --> 01:56.735
...so that everyone feels like they have a place here at the White House.
