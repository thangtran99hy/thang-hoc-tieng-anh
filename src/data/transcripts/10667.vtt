The sounds of 1930s Paris fill the room at this coffeehouse in Florida.

00:07.450 --> 00:10.500
The Cook Trio specializes in Gypsy Jazz.

00:10.850 --> 00:13.600
Jason Cook is the group's lead guitarist.

00:13.700 --> 00:17.800
It's very happy and it's not a very subdued play... way of playing.

00:17.850 --> 00:18.900
It's very over the top...

00:18.950 --> 00:21.400
...you know, it's like true guitar music, you know.

00:23.100 --> 00:26.600
Gypsy Jazz originated in France during the 1930s.

00:26.700 --> 00:30.500
Guitarist Django Reinhardt was instrumental in developing the style,...

00:30.600 --> 00:33.300
...having grown up in gypsy camps near Paris.

00:35.150 --> 00:38.150
Today's Gypsy Jazz musicians imitate Reinhardt,...

00:38.200 --> 00:43.300
...who played alongside violinist Stephane Grappelli in the group Quintette du Hot Club de France.

00:43.600 --> 00:47.000
Reinhardt played guitar chords with just two or three fingers.

00:47.150 --> 00:49.400
Other Gypsy Jazz musicians do as well.

00:49.600 --> 00:53.550
The Cook Trio's Kyle Jones says Reinhardt's music is notable...

00:53.600 --> 00:58.300
...for its distinctive, fast-paced, rhythmic, guitar strumming known as "La Pompe".

00:58.550 --> 01:01.200
The guitar, you know, pushes the whole thing.

01:01.250 --> 01:03.850
It's, you know, like a pulse, you know, they call it "The Pump".

01:04.450 --> 01:07.200
It really is like the pulse of the music that drives it forward.
