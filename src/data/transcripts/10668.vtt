In case you haven't heard the news,...

00:02.600 --> 00:06.100
...the Eiffel Tower is 120 years old this year.

00:06.850 --> 00:10.100
To celebrate, they installed a new set of lights...

00:10.350 --> 00:12.550
...on the side facing the Trocadero.

00:13.100 --> 00:16.400
And every night from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m.,...

00:16.700 --> 00:19.850
...they "play" with them for 12 minutes.

00:20.700 --> 00:24.150
Well, when I say, "they," I mean, the computer,...

00:24.350 --> 00:28.000
...as of course, all these lights are computer controlled.
