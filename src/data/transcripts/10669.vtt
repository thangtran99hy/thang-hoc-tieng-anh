Well, can I say this? Can I say this, little guys?

00:04.000 --> 00:05.620
I think one thing that's important to remember...

00:06.975 --> 00:07.745
..is that...

00:08.205 --> 00:11.245
You know, even though there's a lot of fun to Christmas...

00:11.610 --> 00:13.845
...especially when it's snowy like this...

00:16.200 --> 00:19.120
...so it's pretty outside. You got the Christmas tree, you got the Christmas cookies,...

00:19.715 --> 00:22.055
...you got, you got presents.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.020
You know, I think that...

00:24.760 --> 00:28.820
...the most important thing is just to remember why we celebrate Christmas,...

00:29.025 --> 00:29.565
...which is...

00:30.695 --> 00:31.105
Do you know?

00:32.165 --> 00:33.665
The birth of Baby Jesus...

00:33.800 --> 00:36.705
...and the... and what he symbolizes...

00:37.100 --> 00:39.205
...for people all around the world is...

00:39.405 --> 00:41.275
...is the possibility of peace...

00:41.875 --> 00:44.645
...and people treating each other with respect.

00:45.270 --> 00:47.980
And so, I just hope that spirit of giving...

00:48.345 --> 00:51.520
...that's so important to Christmas, I hope all of you guys remember that as well.

00:51.785 --> 00:54.990
You know, it's not just about getting a gift but it's also doing something for other people.

00:55.500 --> 01:01.095
So, being nice to your mom and dad and grandma and aunties and...

01:01.325 --> 01:02.765
...showing respect to people.

01:03.370 --> 01:05.965
That's really important too. That's part of the Christmas spirit, don't you think?

01:06.110 --> 01:06.865
Do you agree with me?

01:07.400 --> 01:07.865
You do?

01:08.200 --> 01:10.230
Okay, do you have an interesting observation?

01:10.590 --> 01:13.305
I know why we give gifts to other people.

01:13.445 --> 01:13.875
Why is that?

01:14.175 --> 01:17.375
'Cause the Three Wise Men gave gifts to Baby Jesus.

01:17.435 --> 01:18.505
That's exactly right.
