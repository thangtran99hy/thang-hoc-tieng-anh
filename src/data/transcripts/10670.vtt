The room that you see behind me is called the Surge Room...

00:04.550 --> 00:08.350
...and that's where we literally surge personnel in a crisis.

00:08.500 --> 00:11.100
We keep the phones and the computers always on,...

00:11.550 --> 00:16.100
...so that we can provide instant access and start fusing information...

00:16.150 --> 00:19.625
...to provide a summary for the decision makers in the White House,...

00:19.675 --> 00:23.400
...so that they can make the decisions in response to that situation or crisis.

00:23.700 --> 00:26.100
And hence the clever name, Situation Room.

00:27.400 --> 00:30.400
1/3 of the personnel come from the Intelligence Community,...

00:30.700 --> 00:33.400
...1/3 come from the Department of Homeland Security...

00:33.550 --> 00:36.000
...and the remainder comes from the US Military.

00:36.650 --> 00:39.400
We are sent here because we're apolitical.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.150
We're not Democrats. We're not Republicans.

00:42.300 --> 00:44.500
We're here to support our nation,...

00:44.650 --> 00:49.000
...and the President of the United States, and the institution of the presidency.

00:49.250 --> 00:52.300
And all of the people who work in the White House Situation Room...

00:52.400 --> 00:55.900
...are simply the best and the brightest that this nation can offer.

00:56.050 --> 00:58.850
And they do the very best job that they can do.

01:06.250 --> 01:10.500
Wolf Blitzer sits about a mile away, I think in his Situation Room...

01:10.550 --> 01:12.250
...but not the White House Situation Room.
