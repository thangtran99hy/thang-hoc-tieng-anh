Randy Dahn is a research scientist at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory,...

00:06.700 --> 00:09.750
...a biomedical research facility near Bar Harbor, Maine.

00:10.250 --> 00:14.200
Dahn and his colleagues are studying skates and other marine vertebrates...

00:14.400 --> 00:16.800
...to find out how they regrow their fins.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.350
So, they carefully amputate their fins,...

00:19.400 --> 00:22.400
...and then, study the role genes play in regenerating them.

00:22.600 --> 00:29.500
So once we understand, we can compare and contrast how all these different groups accomplish this feat,...

00:29.800 --> 00:35.000
...and then, we can then apply that knowledge to higher vertebrates like humans and mice.

00:35.550 --> 00:37.700
Salamanders also regrow their limbs.

00:37.900 --> 00:41.400
Scientists have been studying how they regenerate their limbs for decades...

00:41.550 --> 00:45.500
...and they understand how tissues interact with each other during this process,...

00:45.950 --> 00:49.600
...but the real challenge is to understand what's happening at the molecular level.

00:49.950 --> 00:54.900
So right now, we're trying to figure out what genes drive this process...

00:55.300 --> 01:02.050
...and then, once we understand that, we can understand why humans fail to regenerate their limbs,...

01:02.100 --> 01:06.900
...and then hopefully, through genetic trickery, restore that ability.
