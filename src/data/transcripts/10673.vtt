Hi, I'm Hartmut. I'm an engineer at Google.

00:03.700 --> 00:05.900
Hi, I'm Shailesh, product manager at Google.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.500
We're here to introduce Google Goggles,...

00:08.600 --> 00:11.100
...a visual search application for Android phones.

00:11.750 --> 00:15.950
Until now, the only option for web search has been typing or speaking.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.400
Now, you can search by taking a photo.

00:19.100 --> 00:20.050
Let's try this book.

00:20.950 --> 00:22.500
Just open Google Goggles,...

00:23.000 --> 00:25.700
...fill as much of the screen as possible with the object...

00:25.900 --> 00:26.850
...and take a picture.

00:27.650 --> 00:30.150
You'll see the exact book match in the search results...

00:30.300 --> 00:32.000
...without typing or saying a word.

00:32.550 --> 00:34.600
Another good use is on a business card.

00:34.850 --> 00:35.700
Let's try mine.

00:36.100 --> 00:38.050
Frame the text you're interested in well.

00:38.600 --> 00:41.850
Google Goggles will recognize the text and return a result.

00:42.650 --> 00:46.250
Now, I can click to call Shailesh or add him to my contacts.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.150
Let's go out and check what else Google Goggles can do.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.950
We can figure out the title and artist of this painting,...

00:54.050 --> 00:55.350
...or landmark information.

00:58.900 --> 01:02.250
For local business information, you don't even need to take a picture.

01:02.750 --> 01:04.800
Just point your phone at the store.

01:05.200 --> 01:08.750
Using GPS and compass, Google Goggles will show you the name.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.000
Tap the name to learn more about that store.

01:12.750 --> 01:15.000
Visual search technology is still in its infancy.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.600
It works best on things like we saw today...

01:18.450 --> 01:23.250
...but it doesn't work well yet on things like food, cars, plants or animals.

01:23.650 --> 01:27.250
And we're only scratching the surface of the visual search technology.

01:27.700 --> 01:30.700
In the future, it will help you do more cool things,...

01:31.150 --> 01:33.250
...like suggesting a move in a chess game...

01:33.500 --> 01:36.600
...or taking a picture of a leaf to identify the plant.

01:37.350 --> 01:39.950
You might wonder what happens to all these pictures you're taking.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.600
You can choose to discard them as soon as the search is done...

01:44.150 --> 01:46.900
...or save them to your search history to view them at any time.

01:47.650 --> 01:50.150
It's available for Android-powered phones now.

01:50.500 --> 01:55.450
To download, go to Android Market from your phone and search for Google Goggles.
