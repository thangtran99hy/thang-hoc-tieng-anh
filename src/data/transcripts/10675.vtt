00:00.100 --> 00:00.700
Thanks, Kevin.

00:02.650 --> 00:05.100
We are very pleased with the company's third quarter.

00:06.350 --> 00:10.050
The strong financial performance is a result of having the right products...

00:10.100 --> 00:14.750
...at the right cost at the right time for a recovering global economy.

00:16.100 --> 00:19.000
The strength in our business remains primarily consumer driven...

00:19.550 --> 00:22.700
...with broad-based demand across all geographies.

00:23.900 --> 00:26.500
Our mobile business had a particularly strong quarter.

00:27.050 --> 00:31.450
In fact, we saw the sequential unit growth rate of notebook processors and chipsets...

00:32.100 --> 00:35.350
...actually exceed the growth rate of Atom processors and chipsets.

00:36.300 --> 00:39.150
While Atom and netbooks are important growth drivers for us,...

00:39.600 --> 00:43.550
...our traditional notebook business remains one of the primary drivers of revenue growth...

00:44.150 --> 00:47.000
...and we expect that to continue in the future.
