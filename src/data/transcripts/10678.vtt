00:00.450 --> 00:00.950
Thanks, Paul.

00:02.050 --> 00:07.650
The combination of strong execution and a strengthening market led to exceptional financial results.

00:08.650 --> 00:12.200
Better-than-expected demand in the microprocessor and chipset businesses...

00:12.400 --> 00:16.800
...led to the largest sequential third quarter revenue growth in over 30 years.

00:17.950 --> 00:22.700
Gross margin percent at 58% was up nearly seven points from the second quarter.

00:23.550 --> 00:27.800
Operating profit was up 80% and net income was up 77%...

00:28.100 --> 00:33.300
...excluding the impact of the 1.45 billion-dollar EC fine taken in the second quarter.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.350
The PC market segment is recovering nicely...

00:37.850 --> 00:43.550
...with our microprocessor revenue excluding Atom growing 23% since the market bottomed in the first quarter.

00:44.400 --> 00:48.900
In the same time period, Atom microprocessors and associated chipsets...

00:49.200 --> 00:52.550
...have grown to 450 million dollars in revenue in the third quarter...

00:52.700 --> 00:54.750
...and one billion dollars year-to-date.

00:56.600 --> 00:59.800
Gross margin benefited from exceptional execution in the third quarter.

01:00.350 --> 01:05.050
We responded to our customers' upside requests and achieved a significant reduction in costs...

01:05.350 --> 01:10.550
...resulting in a 58% gross margin, a nearly seven-point increase from the third quarter.
