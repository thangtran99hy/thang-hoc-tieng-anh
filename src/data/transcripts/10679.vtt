00:00.100 --> 00:04.670
By adding Marvel to our slate of Disney Pixar and Pixar films,..

00:05.170 --> 00:10.410
...we will, in the coming year, be making movies under three of the best known labels in family entertainment.

00:11.065 --> 00:15.080
These brands resonate with consumers globally and give us a competitive advantage...

00:15.450 --> 00:17.785
...in a world of nearly limitless choices.

00:19.185 --> 00:22.655
We will also continue to focus our investment on franchise properties...

00:22.920 --> 00:28.060
...like Princess and the Frog, Cars 2, Toy Story 3 and Pirates 4.

00:28.825 --> 00:32.640
When our franchise films are successful, they create a wave across the company...

00:32.895 --> 00:35.770
...that can lift up all of our Disney-branded businesses.

00:37.500 --> 00:40.960
While it remains a challenging time, it's also a very exciting one.

00:41.170 --> 00:46.445
Our parks and resorts business is expanding with the addition of attractions that bring together great creativity...

00:46.925 --> 00:50.485
...and fantastic new technologies at Disney's California Adventure,...

00:50.915 --> 00:54.455
...at Hong Kong Disneyland, and at the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World.

00:55.255 --> 00:58.425
Work is well underway on our new family resort in Hawaii...

00:58.755 --> 01:00.660
...and on two magnificent new cruise ships...

01:00.760 --> 01:03.665
...whose design we unveiled a couple of weeks ago in New York.
