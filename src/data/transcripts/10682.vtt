Before I turn the call over to Cathie to review the financials,...

00:03.650 --> 00:07.350
...let me make just a few comments as we head in 2010.

00:07.650 --> 00:12.450
First, we have worked hard on our cost structure to emerge from this economic downturn...

00:12.700 --> 00:14.700
...more competitively positioned.

00:15.100 --> 00:20.750
We've made significant progress in structurally reducing our cost structure in services,...

00:21.100 --> 00:27.200
...IPG, supply chain, warranty, real estate and IT.

00:27.850 --> 00:31.950
At the same time, we plan to increase investments in the business...

00:32.150 --> 00:34.200
...in areas such as sales coverage.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.650
Going forward, we expect solid operating leverage...

00:37.900 --> 00:41.150
...just like we demonstrated from Q3 to Q4.
