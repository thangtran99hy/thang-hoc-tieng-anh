00:01.122 --> 00:04.087
Every single one of you has something that you're good at.

00:05.231 --> 00:07.485
Every single one of you has something to offer.

00:08.448 --> 00:12.494
And you have a responsibility to yourself to discover what that is.

00:13.803 --> 00:16.541
That's the opportunity an education can provide.

00:17.732 --> 00:19.844
Maybe you could be a great writer.

00:20.282 --> 00:24.037
Maybe even good enough to write a book or articles in a newspaper,...

00:24.186 --> 00:27.464
...but you might not know it until you write that English paper,...

00:28.579 --> 00:30.866
...that English class paper that's assigned to you.

00:32.179 --> 00:34.181
Maybe you could be an innovator or an inventor.

00:34.309 --> 00:38.867
Maybe even good enough to come up with the next iPhone, or the new medicine, or vaccine,...

00:39.417 --> 00:43.556
...but you might not know it until you do your project for your Science class.

00:45.325 --> 00:49.840
Maybe you could be a mayor, or a senator, or a supreme court justice,...

00:50.823 --> 00:55.125
...but you might not know that until you join student government or the debate team.

00:57.062 --> 00:59.062
And no matter what you want to do with your life,...

00:59.247 --> 01:01.608
...I guarantee that you'll need an education to do it.

01:02.802 --> 01:05.524
You wanna be a doctor, or a teacher, or a police officer?

01:06.499 --> 01:10.371
You wanna be a nurse, or an architect, a lawyer, or a member of our military?

01:10.890 --> 01:14.561
You're gonna need a good education for every single one of those careers.

01:15.571 --> 01:19.219
You cannot drop out of school and just drop into a good job.

01:20.662 --> 01:24.611
You've got to train for it, and work for it, and learn for it.

01:26.011 --> 01:28.633
And this isn't just important for your own life and your own future.

01:30.167 --> 01:34.651
What you make of your education will decide nothing less than the future of this country.

01:35.421 --> 01:37.931
The future of America depends on you.

01:39.669 --> 01:43.235
What you're learning in school today will determine whether we as a nation...

01:43.368 --> 01:46.126
...can meet our greatest challenges in the future.
