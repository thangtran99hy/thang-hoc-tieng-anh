After a tough year that saw U.S. car sales at 26-year lows,...

00:05.150 --> 00:08.150
...industry experts say, automakers are turning the corner.

00:10.300 --> 00:15.300
And in 2010, Magazine Editor Richard Headland says, the buzzword is "green".

00:15.350 --> 00:20.900
The emerging trend in 2010 is gonna be a continued move towards environmentally friendly cars.

00:20.950 --> 00:24.750
So, the big focus right now is on miles per gallon and CO2,...

00:24.800 --> 00:28.350
...and if you go to all the big car shows now, they're the words that dominate.

00:28.400 --> 00:33.550
Analysts say, improving access to credit and a return to 3% growth in the global economy...

00:33.750 --> 00:38.500
...will help car manufacturers recapture some of the ground lost in 2009.

00:38.700 --> 00:43.850
To do that, automakers are re-designing to make new models more attractive to young and old.

00:44.100 --> 00:50.300
For younger buyers, Toyota's Hi-CT gets its inspiration from popular Japanese anime characters.

00:50.550 --> 00:54.450
And car makers are also seeing great potential in upscale markets.

00:54.500 --> 00:59.150
I think we're gonna see with the luxury car market is more and more luxury hybrids.

00:59.300 --> 01:02.650
So Lexus, for example, already has several luxury hybrids.

01:02.950 --> 01:07.350
BMW is working on its first luxury hybrids, Mercedes as well.

01:07.400 --> 01:13.400
Automakers are also hoping to snap consumers out of their recessionary mood by using brighter colors.

01:13.650 --> 01:16.800
Octavio Navarro is a spokesman for the Ford Motor Company.

01:16.850 --> 01:19.050
Everybody has vibrant colors, you know.

01:19.650 --> 01:21.650
Typically, it'd be black or gray...

01:21.700 --> 01:25.725
...but you're really starting to see bright yellows or bright blues.

01:26.250 --> 01:31.850
Ford in particular, one of the things we are introducing this year is the 2011 Fiesta...

01:32.350 --> 01:36.750
...and one of my favorite colors for it is called "Lime Squeeze".
