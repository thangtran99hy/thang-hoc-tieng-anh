This is not the first time this group has targeted us.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.150
In recent years, they have bombed Yemeni government facilities and Western hotels,...

00:07.500 --> 00:11.950
...restaurants and embassies, including our embassy in 2008, killing one American.

00:12.500 --> 00:16.600
So as president, I've made it a priority to strengthen our partnership with the Yemeni government...

00:16.950 --> 00:19.200
...training and equipping their security forces,...

00:19.400 --> 00:23.400
...sharing intelligence and working with them to strike al-Qaeda terrorists.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.200
And even before Christmas Day, we had seen the results.

00:26.550 --> 00:30.400
Training camps have been struck, leaders eliminated, plots disrupted.

00:30.850 --> 00:34.400
And all those involved in the attempted act of terrorism on Christmas must know,...

00:34.650 --> 00:36.350
...you too will be held to account.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.600
But these efforts are only part of a wider cause.

00:40.150 --> 00:43.250
It's been nearly a year since I stood on the steps of the US Capitol...

00:43.550 --> 00:45.550
...and took the oath of office as your president.

00:46.150 --> 00:49.400
And with that oath came the solemn responsibility that I carry with me...

00:49.600 --> 00:51.100
...every moment of every day,...

00:51.600 --> 00:55.050
...the responsibility to protect the safety and security of the American people.

00:55.900 --> 00:57.650
On that day, I also made it very clear,...

00:58.000 --> 01:02.200
...our nation is at war against a far reaching network of violence and hatred,...

01:02.500 --> 01:06.050
...and that we will do whatever it takes to defeat them and defend our country,...

01:06.400 --> 01:10.800
...even as we uphold the values that have always distinguished America among nations.

01:11.500 --> 01:14.100
Make no mistake; that's exactly what we've been doing.
