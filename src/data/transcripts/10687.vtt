00:00.700 --> 00:03.650
Just as al-Qaeda and its allies are constantly evolving...

00:03.700 --> 00:06.200
...and adapting their efforts to strike us,...

00:06.700 --> 00:09.850
...we have to constantly adapt and evolve to defeat them.

00:10.550 --> 00:14.300
Because as we saw on Christmas, the margin for error is slim...

00:14.950 --> 00:17.650
...and the consequences of failure can be catastrophic.

00:18.850 --> 00:22.200
As these violent extremists pursue new havens,...

00:22.900 --> 00:25.450
...we intend to target al-Qaeda wherever they take root,...

00:25.950 --> 00:28.350
...forging new partnerships to deny them sanctuary...

00:28.700 --> 00:31.700
...as we are doing currently with the government in Yemen.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.950
As our adversaries seek new recruits,...

00:35.050 --> 00:40.000
...we'll constantly review and rapidly update our intelligence and our institutions.

00:40.550 --> 00:44.100
As they refine our tactics, we'll enhance our defenses,...

00:44.350 --> 00:47.100
...including smarter screening and security at airports...

00:47.150 --> 00:52.350
...and investing in the technologies that might have detected the kind of explosives used on Christmas.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.850
In short, we need our intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement systems...

00:58.250 --> 01:02.050
...and the people in them to be accountable, and to work as intended.

01:02.450 --> 01:07.800
Collecting, sharing, integrating, analyzing and acting on intelligence as quickly,...

01:08.000 --> 01:10.950
...and effectively as possible to save innocent lives,...

01:11.450 --> 01:14.200
...not just most of the time, but all of the time.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.600
That's what the American people deserve.

01:17.450 --> 01:21.000
As president, that's exactly what I will demand.

01:21.550 --> 01:22.300
Thank you very much.
