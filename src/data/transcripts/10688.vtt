00:01.100 --> 00:03.150
From toys coated with lead paint...

00:03.200 --> 00:06.050
...to tainted milk, to contaminated pet food.

00:06.350 --> 00:10.050
These images have shaped what it means to be "Made in China".

00:10.250 --> 00:13.350
Cheap, made very inexpensively...

00:14.350 --> 00:17.875
...and I guess, there are some quality issues that nag at the back of your mind.

00:19.400 --> 00:24.550
With a 30-second TV commercial, China is trying to change years of bad press.

00:26.350 --> 00:30.250
Commissioned by China's Commerce Ministry and four major industry groups.

00:30.550 --> 00:34.800
This commercial is believed to be the government's first bid at global branding.

00:35.050 --> 00:38.050
An offshoot of an American ad agency made it.

00:38.250 --> 00:42.800
The TV spot highlights Chinese products made with worldwide partners.

00:42.900 --> 00:47.050
I think it's reasonably sophisticated for Western audiences.

00:47.100 --> 00:48.450
I think it has a modern feel.

00:48.800 --> 00:53.450
International media consultant, Tapio Christiansen has worked with Chinese companies.

00:53.700 --> 00:58.650
He says, the commercial is necessary after melamine tainted milk produced in China...

00:58.900 --> 01:03.450
...killed at least six Chinese children and made hundreds of thousands sick.

01:03.900 --> 01:07.800
They did a pretty decent job in trying to potentially dispel...

01:07.950 --> 01:12.900
...some of the perceptions that some in the West have about Chinese goods.
