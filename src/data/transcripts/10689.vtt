A truck belonging to Google pulls up at the Stanford University Library near San Francisco...

00:08.000 --> 00:09.300
...just before nine in the morning.

00:09.750 --> 00:13.650
It's loaded with books that Google checked out and is now returning,...

00:13.850 --> 00:17.450
...after having scanned them so they can be uploaded onto a computer.

00:20.150 --> 00:23.650
Once the truck is empty, library workers load it up again,...

00:23.900 --> 00:25.600
...with more books to digitize.

00:26.150 --> 00:32.800
Google Books Director Daniel Clancy says the company's goal is to scan up to 40 million books.

00:33.400 --> 00:37.700
Google said our mission is to organize all the world's information.

00:38.550 --> 00:42.300
In addition to Stanford, the University of California in Berkeley...

00:42.400 --> 00:47.400
...and the University of Michigan have signed agreements authorizing Google to scan their books.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.100
Stanford Librarian Michael Keller says the initiative can give new life to obscure books.

00:54.450 --> 00:58.400
What happens when you digitize these books and make them accessible on the net...

00:58.700 --> 01:00.500
...is that they get a lot more use.

01:00.700 --> 01:05.050
People can find the stuff 10 times more use than formerly was recorded.

01:06.050 --> 01:10.350
Silicon Valley attorney Gary Reback represents the Open Book Alliance,...

01:10.600 --> 01:13.650
...whose members include Microsoft and Amazon.com.

01:14.050 --> 01:19.300
He warns that even though Google may start out by not charging for access to what it digitizes,...

01:19.550 --> 01:24.300
...it may eventually impose big fees to use its online library.

01:24.700 --> 01:27.600
It's not a public library, it's a private library.

01:28.050 --> 01:31.200
And it's being run for profit, big profits.

01:31.600 --> 01:36.850
Google is gonna charge university scholars, ordinary people,...

01:37.250 --> 01:43.550
...even school children to get access to books that Google copied.

01:43.900 --> 01:48.850
Digitizing current books whose copyright holders are known is not in dispute.

01:49.250 --> 01:53.000
Neither is digitizing older books whose copyrights have expired.
