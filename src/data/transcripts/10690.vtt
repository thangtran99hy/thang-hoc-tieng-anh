00:00.883 --> 00:03.783
From its enormous base to the tip of its delicate spire,...

00:03.800 --> 00:07.250
...the Burj Khalifa soars more than 800 meters into the sky.

00:07.688 --> 00:10.148
With more than 160 habitable floors...

00:10.244 --> 00:14.114
...and containing enough steel to stretch a quarter of the way around the world,...

00:14.359 --> 00:18.033
...it is the crowning achievement of Dubai's decadelong construction boom.

00:18.354 --> 00:20.620
Investment Analyst Saud Masud:...

00:20.981 --> 00:22.447
It's the tallest building in the world.

00:23.204 --> 00:29.028
It speaks to the economic momentum Dubai has had for several years now.

00:29.432 --> 00:33.283
And so, they have taken bold steps and they've achieved something there.

00:33.557 --> 00:35.223
But some question the achievement.

00:35.447 --> 00:39.640
When the tower was first conceived, Dubai's fortune seemed almost limitless.

00:39.896 --> 00:42.642
Today, the tiny Arab Emirate is mired in debt.

00:42.970 --> 00:46.846
In November, state-owned conglomerate Dubai World roiled global markets...

00:47.074 --> 00:50.943
...after announcing it was delaying repayment of 60 billion in loans.

00:51.256 --> 00:52.340
Despite the crisis,...

00:52.530 --> 00:55.470
...the building's developers say they're optimistic about the future.

00:55.700 --> 00:58.600
Mohammed Alabbar is Chairman of Emaar Properties.

00:59.005 --> 01:04.731
Crises come and go. And the world has gone through two years of difficult times.

01:04.853 --> 01:07.967
We must have hope and optimism, then we must move on.

01:08.196 --> 01:10.727
And I think, this is a message that, you know,...

01:10.851 --> 01:14.607
...I hope that it's a beginning of a gradual move forward.

01:14.812 --> 01:16.556
But the move forward could be slow.

01:16.768 --> 01:21.548
The tower opens as a glut of new homes and buildings remain largely vacant;...

01:21.706 --> 01:24.451
...the result of a building boom that has since gone bust.

01:24.721 --> 01:28.788
Masud says the Burj itself has become a symbol of the downturn in real estate,...

01:29.016 --> 01:31.591
..which many say caused the financial crisis.

01:31.872 --> 01:36.632
And I don't see this economic downcycle being over in the next few quarters...

01:36.706 --> 01:38.164
...or even in the next year or so.

01:38.368 --> 01:43.069
So, I think the economic problems or challenges will persist...

01:43.200 --> 01:50.873
...in the face of a pretty awesome, I would say, a structure... a man-made structure.

01:51.716 --> 01:54.647
But those two ironies, in my opinion, will coexist for a while.
