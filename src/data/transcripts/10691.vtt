00:00.850 --> 00:03.500
Now, any city can be a harbor city...

00:03.550 --> 00:07.450
...say researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.

00:07.650 --> 00:13.600
Institute President Suh Nam-pyo says he got the idea for the mobile harbor on a trip to Singapore.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.050
I saw all these ships waiting out there.

00:16.300 --> 00:22.500
My guess was that they were there waiting for their turns to load and unload their cargo.

00:23.750 --> 00:26.800
So I said, "Why should ships come into the harbor, right?"

00:27.350 --> 00:30.650
"Why not have the harbor go out there and then just bring the goods in?"

00:31.000 --> 00:34.600
Researchers describe the mobile harbor as a lean, light system...

00:34.650 --> 00:39.600
...for unloading container ships even if the coastal area is too shallow for them to dock.

00:39.650 --> 00:42.250
Specially designed cargo barges would head out...

00:42.300 --> 00:46.200
...to meet and unload gigantic container ships along any coastline.

00:46.300 --> 00:51.650
The vessels will have the advantage of being able to navigate shallow water and squeeze through rivers.

00:51.800 --> 00:56.400
At the shore, they then will offload onto specially designed receiving platforms.

00:56.700 --> 01:02.650
It sounds easy but Senior Engineer Gwak Byung-man admits there are daunting technical challenges.

01:04.050 --> 01:05.700
The ocean is always rippling...

01:05.850 --> 01:07.550
...and especially for smaller boats.

01:07.700 --> 01:11.550
It is extremely hard to load and unload containers in a stable way.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.550
So our main challenges are, how do we stabilize the vessel itself in all those waves?

01:16.850 --> 01:20.500
And second, how do we stabilize the loading equipment aboard the vessel?

01:22.600 --> 01:26.850
An institute exhibition displays the project's obsession with stability.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.800
Pulleys, axles and shock absorbers document researchers' efforts to deal with the rolling waves.
