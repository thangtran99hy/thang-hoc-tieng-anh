Most people don't know or don't care who you are.

00:05.535 --> 00:09.040
Sometimes, if I tell somebody who I am, they'll say, "No, you ain't."

00:25.630 --> 00:29.065
The hardest thing to be in songwriting is to be simple and yet profound.

00:29.460 --> 00:32.050
Bill seemed to understand how to do that.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.340
Most of the major record companies call me up.

00:34.535 --> 00:38.775
They had this rhythm and blues syndrome in their minds, with the horns and the three chicks...

00:39.005 --> 00:40.200
...and the gold lame suit.

00:40.305 --> 00:41.500
And I wasn't really into that.

00:41.695 --> 00:45.745
So I thought, "Well, I got this good job making these toilets. I don't need you guys."

00:47.315 --> 00:50.685
My real life was when I was just a working guy.

00:50.810 --> 00:52.250
You know, it's okay to...

00:52.390 --> 00:53.855
...head out for wonderful.

00:54.155 --> 00:58.125
But on your way to wonderful, you gonna have to pass through alright.

00:58.365 --> 01:01.895
And when you get to alright, take a good look around and get used to it,...

01:02.005 --> 01:04.130
...'cause that may be as far as you gonna go.

01:07.835 --> 01:13.285
There are millions and millions of people that would love to see and hear Bill Withers again.

01:13.405 --> 01:16.875
I want everybody to look at me and everybody to wanna know me, and...

01:17.010 --> 01:19.900
...there was a time when that was... that was it, huh?

01:20.015 --> 01:24.215
Bill Withers can work a whole lot and make a whole lot of money if he wanted to do that.

01:24.350 --> 01:27.220
I'm trying to give myself a chance to get driven.

01:27.485 --> 01:32.355
Thoreau I think said, "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."

01:32.725 --> 01:36.695
I would like to know how it feels for my desperation to get louder.

01:45.305 --> 01:46.905
Both personally...

01:48.005 --> 01:51.010
...as a human being and as a great artist that you are,...

01:51.245 --> 01:53.245
...what would you want your legacy to be?
