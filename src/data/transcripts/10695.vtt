I went to Le Salon du Vintage recently.

00:04.300 --> 00:09.350
A sort of high end flea market dedicated to stuff from the late 60s,...

00:09.550 --> 00:12.200
...the 70s and the early 80s.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.750
The show took place in the heart of Saint Germain...

00:16.150 --> 00:18.250
...and it was a real success.

00:19.200 --> 00:24.600
You know, I try not to be one of those "before it was better" persons,...

00:25.250 --> 00:31.000
...but I still think that there is nothing more elegant than a woman outfit from the 60s.
