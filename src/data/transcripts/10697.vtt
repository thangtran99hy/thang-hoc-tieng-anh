00:01.250 --> 00:04.350
You know, Democrats and the Republicans are the category.

00:04.700 --> 00:06.850
The Republicans and Democrats differ.

00:07.200 --> 00:10.800
Like on the rare occasions when I vote, and they're pretty rare,...

00:11.550 --> 00:15.400
...sometimes I vote for Democrats, sometimes for Republicans, sometimes for somebody else.

00:17.200 --> 00:21.500
It's not a sharp split. They're two factions of the same party.

00:21.550 --> 00:26.850
We have a one-party state with two somewhat different factions with a lot of overlap.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.200
Business Party has a couple of factions.

00:30.500 --> 00:33.250
By a little bit, you'd find some differences between them.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.300
I wouldn't say there's no difference on the average.

00:37.050 --> 00:39.800
So, what should you do in that case?

00:40.150 --> 00:42.100
Well, like everything, it's your own choice.

00:42.150 --> 00:46.800
Do you wanna live in a democratic society or do you wanna live in the society we have?

00:47.550 --> 00:51.250
Which, remember, is not a democratic society and it's not intended to be.

00:51.700 --> 00:55.100
If you take the course in political theory here,...

00:55.400 --> 00:59.100
...I'm sure they'll teach you that the United States is not a democracy.

00:59.500 --> 01:02.600
It's what's called in the technical literature, a polyarchy.

01:03.500 --> 01:09.500
That's the term invented by the leading democratic theorist at Yale, Professor Robert Dahl.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.100
But the idea is old,...

01:12.400 --> 01:16.850
...very, just way back to James Madison and the foundation of the Constitution.

01:17.200 --> 01:24.250
A polyarchy is a system in which power resides in the hands of those who Madison called...

01:24.300 --> 01:25.600
...the wealth of the nation,...

01:26.000 --> 01:27.850
...the responsible class of men,...

01:28.600 --> 01:32.300
...and the rest of the population is fragmented, distracted,...

01:32.950 --> 01:35.850
...and allowed to participate every couple of years.

01:35.900 --> 01:39.300
They're allowed to come and say, "Yes, thank you."

01:39.450 --> 01:41.350
"Why don't you continue for another four years?"

01:41.800 --> 01:48.000
And they have a little choice among the responsible men or the wealth of the nation.
