"Filthy water cannot be washed," according to a West African proverb.

00:07.004 --> 00:07.837
But what if it could?

00:08.224 --> 00:10.379
That's the goal of a wastewater treatment plant,...

00:10.637 --> 00:12.671
...like the one that serves the Washington area.

00:13.131 --> 00:17.091
The Blue Plains wastewater treatment facility is the largest of its kind in the world.

00:17.483 --> 00:20.409
And according to its Director of Wastewater Treatment Walt Bailey,...

00:20.765 --> 00:23.867
...the plant is a model that other countries may hope to emulate.

00:23.981 --> 00:25.929
We're a very popular tourist stop here.

00:26.605 --> 00:32.158
We've received visitors from all over the world: Asia, Europe, Africa, and South America.

00:32.330 --> 00:35.902
They're looking for sharing of ideas and sharing of technology.

00:36.138 --> 00:39.929
As a matter of fact, Walt says the technology involved in nitrogen removal...

00:40.025 --> 00:43.227
...for wastewater was developed in Cape Town, South Africa.

00:43.721 --> 00:46.669
But what Blue Plains has built may be difficult for many other countries...

00:46.737 --> 00:48.541
...to replicate because of cost.

00:48.737 --> 00:53.462
We've spent probably a billion dollars over the last ten years improving every feature.

00:53.898 --> 00:56.127
But if you wanna come and see any one of the pieces...

00:56.213 --> 00:57.830
...to understand how the primary treatment works,...

00:57.959 --> 01:00.351
...how the secondary treatment works, how the filtering system works,...

01:00.592 --> 01:04.889
...what technology is being used, and the computer systems that we have set up to manage the plant.

01:05.372 --> 01:07.278
Any one of those pieces may be relevant to the systems...

01:07.414 --> 01:09.179
...to the systems that you're putting in your place.

01:09.500 --> 01:12.271
And we welcome people coming here, and learning from what we've done.

01:12.459 --> 01:15.923
Flooding wastewater can have devastating effects on a region's environment.

01:16.356 --> 01:19.408
Crops were recently lost near the Gaza town of Khan Younis...

01:19.493 --> 01:23.448
...because of wastewater that flooded farms before it reached the treatment facility.

01:23.985 --> 01:26.183
In other parts of the world, human and animal waste...

01:26.277 --> 01:30.558
...making its way into a community's water is blamed for a number of deadly diseases.

01:31.009 --> 01:34.883
That is one of the great services that you seek to have in modern society,...

01:34.977 --> 01:37.296
...and without it, there's catastrophe to pay.

01:37.553 --> 01:40.903
For example, more people die every year from waterborne illnesses...

01:40.985 --> 01:42.552
...in the rest of the world than in all the wars...

01:42.713 --> 01:46.426
...because of the tremendous consequence of pollutants in the water waste.
