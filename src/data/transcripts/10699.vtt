Practitioners of alternative medicine have recommended ginkgo biloba...

00:04.400 --> 00:08.750
...as a means of maintaining and even improving memory among older adults.

00:09.050 --> 00:14.300
But until now, strong clinical evidence about its effectiveness has not been forthcoming.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.650
This is the first and so far, the only study...

00:16.850 --> 00:19.800
...that has looked specifically at its ability to prevent decline.

00:20.400 --> 00:24.250
For eight years, researchers at six universities across the US...

00:24.500 --> 00:28.750
...studied more than 3,000 adults, aged 72 to 96...

00:29.000 --> 00:32.950
...with normal mental functioning or with mild cognitive impairment.

00:33.350 --> 00:39.100
Participants received either a 120 milligram dose of ginkgo extract twice a day...

00:39.350 --> 00:40.450
...or a sugar pill.

00:40.800 --> 00:45.750
Researchers found that ginkgo had no specific effect on memory or attention.

00:45.950 --> 00:48.200
What we can say is that we find no evidence...

00:48.500 --> 00:51.850
...that ginkgo, over this long period of time, made a difference...

00:52.100 --> 00:57.350
...in whether someone's slow change in memory function, as a function of normal aging...

00:57.900 --> 01:00.100
...was affected at all by the medication.

01:00.450 --> 01:05.150
Earlier research showed that ginkgo did nothing for people with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease...

01:05.400 --> 01:08.300
...nor did it help reduce other forms of dementia.

01:08.750 --> 01:11.150
Researchers say, this latest study is notable...

01:11.400 --> 01:14.650
...because it was conducted with the largest number of participants,...

01:14.900 --> 01:19.100
...and it rules out the herbal supplement as a useful treatment for memory loss.

01:19.250 --> 01:22.300
We found that there was no effect of the ginkgo biloba...

01:22.600 --> 01:28.400
...on these very slow but clearly detectable changes in thinking function in late life.

01:28.750 --> 01:30.900
But the researchers added one caveat.

01:31.100 --> 01:35.400
While ginkgo biloba is not effective in slowing down the mental changes of aging,...

01:35.750 --> 01:38.450
...they say it is safe and has no side effects.

01:38.750 --> 01:42.200
