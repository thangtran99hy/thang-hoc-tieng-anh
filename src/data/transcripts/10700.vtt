00:01.700 --> 00:05.850
The researchers looked at data from earlier studies on two antidepressants.

00:06.200 --> 00:11.000
The studies included patients with severe, moderate, and mild forms of depression.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.300
Some were given antidepressants.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.250
Others received a placebo.

00:15.750 --> 00:18.250
Jay Fournier is the study's lead author.

00:18.400 --> 00:24.000
What we found is that patients who are on the lower end of the severity,...

00:24.150 --> 00:26.150
...even on the sort of middle range of severity,...

00:26.400 --> 00:29.050
...the medications weren't doing much more than the placebo was.

00:29.250 --> 00:30.950
For patients at the higher end of severity,...

00:31.100 --> 00:32.700
...the medications had a very potent effect.

00:33.050 --> 00:38.400
Doctors have been sharply divided on how to treat patients with less serious symptoms of depression.

00:38.700 --> 00:41.500
The study does not make treatment recommendations...

00:41.800 --> 00:44.050
...but it has implications for treatment.

00:44.500 --> 00:49.150
Psychiatrist Stuart Sotsky conducted one of the studies included in the review.

00:49.250 --> 00:53.000
I hope that what a study like this will do...

00:53.450 --> 00:57.250
...would be to help alert clinicians,...

00:57.650 --> 01:01.150
...and residents in training, and medical students as well,...

01:01.700 --> 01:07.250
...that severity is an important factor to consider in planning treatment.

01:07.500 --> 01:13.150
Dr. Sotsky says some moderately depressed patients could still benefit from antidepressants,...

01:13.450 --> 01:18.150
...but his study showed that many others could do just as well with exercise,...

01:18.350 --> 01:21.150
...talk therapy, support groups, or self-help.

01:21.350 --> 01:24.600
While they may not respond well to antidepressants,...

01:24.650 --> 01:29.150
...the good news is that there are other effective treatments that can be employed to help.

01:29.750 --> 01:33.800
The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
