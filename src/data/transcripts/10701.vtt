You know to me, it's interesting the way news... the way this business is shaping now.

00:04.360 --> 00:06.170
I mean, especially in cable news, it seems like,...

00:07.240 --> 00:09.340
what's popular right now is opinion,...

00:09.465 --> 00:13.015
...and having a strong opinion, and yelling about it, or wearing it on your sleeve,...

00:13.340 --> 00:14.940
...and sort of cramming it down viewers' throats.

00:15.235 --> 00:17.080
I personally don't have any interest in that.

00:18.185 --> 00:18.860
I don't think,...

00:19.860 --> 00:22.920
...anchors' opinions are frankly all that interesting...

00:23.940 --> 00:26.695
...or any more interesting than anybody else's opinion.

00:27.060 --> 00:30.630
And I just don't believe in...

00:32.165 --> 00:33.635
...wearing my opinion on my sleeve, and...

00:35.455 --> 00:40.530
...sort of slanting news based on what I think, or yelling about it, and yelling down...

00:40.855 --> 00:41.635
...people who are on the show.

00:42.605 --> 00:44.600
I do believe in walking in other people's shoes...

00:44.720 --> 00:47.215
...and try to look at things from as many different angles as possible.

00:47.580 --> 00:51.580
And, I don't think there should be a Republican newscaster or Democratic newscaster...

00:51.680 --> 00:53.720
...or a Liberal newscaster, and a Conservative newscaster.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.655
There are facts and I think...

00:56.455 --> 00:59.690
...our job is to hold people accountable on all sides and to,...

00:59.925 --> 01:02.050
...you know, find out what the facts are and present the facts.

01:02.195 --> 01:04.175
I mean viewers are smart enough to make up their own minds.
