Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:05.250 --> 00:06.650
I'm your maitre d', Seita.

00:07.400 --> 00:10.700
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.550
By the way, do you guys know what's the difference between...

00:14.950 --> 00:18.200
..."I envy her" and "I'm jealous of her" is?

00:19.150 --> 00:22.350
Alright. "I am jealous of her" has a very negative tone.

00:22.950 --> 00:26.500
It means that you're really, really upset about what's happening to that person.

00:27.300 --> 00:28.850
So, don't use "I'm jealous of her",...

00:29.200 --> 00:31.550
...but you should use "I envy her".

00:32.100 --> 00:33.200
This is a really good meaning.

00:33.450 --> 00:36.050
It means that you have respect for what's happening to that person.

00:36.350 --> 00:38.900
So, if something good has happened to that person,...

00:39.200 --> 00:43.000
...and you wanna be like them say, "I envy her", okay?

00:44.650 --> 00:47.950
Alright. Now, today's topic...

01:07.300 --> 01:08.000
Poor you.

01:09.100 --> 01:09.750
Poor you.

01:16.800 --> 01:17.600
Poor you.

01:20.050 --> 01:20.850
Poor him.

01:24.100 --> 01:25.000
Poor me.

01:31.250 --> 01:32.300
And second...

01:34.500 --> 01:35.300
Lucky you.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.100
Lucky you.

01:42.250 --> 01:42.950
Lucky you.

01:46.000 --> 01:46.850
Lucky him.

01:50.250 --> 01:51.200
Lucky me.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.300
Okay, let's practice.

02:02.550 --> 02:03.900
Please repeat after me.

02:05.150 --> 02:06.600
Oh, poor you.

02:10.100 --> 02:10.700
Good, good.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.500
Okay. Now, Lucky me.

02:19.650 --> 02:20.350
Please repeat.

02:22.150 --> 02:22.550
Good.

02:34.800 --> 02:37.200
Alright, that's it for today.

02:37.500 --> 02:42.550
And see you next week on Native Maestro, and we will help you become the native maestro.

02:43.350 --> 02:43.850
Bye-bye!
