00:00.650 --> 00:04.400
And as I worked more and more in the homeless field,...

00:05.050 --> 00:10.500
...I noticed that what people really wanted was their respect back.

00:10.950 --> 00:17.600
They wanted the public to respect them and they wanted to show what they could do as well.

00:18.450 --> 00:21.900
A lot of homeless people are abused on the streets...

00:22.400 --> 00:26.250
...and they're just told by everyone that they're worthless.

00:26.700 --> 00:30.550
And after a long time, you begin to believe that you are worthless.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.500
And so, when I first started working with homeless people, I just saw people...

00:35.550 --> 00:39.850
...who are just a shadow of what they could be and no eye contact,...

00:41.000 --> 00:43.200
...and they really believed that they were no good.

00:43.750 --> 00:47.650
There's no real incentive for people to move forward if they feel that way,...

00:49.700 --> 00:51.450
...so this is just something I noticed.

00:51.500 --> 00:58.200
And when I was there in the night shelter, I worked one night,...

00:58.800 --> 01:03.600
...one of the residents picked up a newspaper and read this quote from a politician...

01:03.700 --> 01:07.700
...who said that homeless people were the people you stepped over coming out of the opera house.

01:08.850 --> 01:11.150
And really, we just started talking.

01:11.200 --> 01:16.800
And someone said, "You know, this is, we're not respected."

01:16.850 --> 01:21.150
"If we were in an opera, we would be... it would change people's opinion."

01:21.850 --> 01:23.600
"It would just sort of challenge people."

01:25.550 --> 01:28.500
And I having worked in the arts, I knew this.

01:29.200 --> 01:33.750
There was something quite... there could be quite a lot of impact with that.

01:34.250 --> 01:37.900
Not only with showing, you know, on stage, homeless people,...

01:39.350 --> 01:42.600
...but how that would have an implication in society.

01:42.700 --> 01:47.485
How, you know, when you work in a newspaper and you read about homelessness,...

01:47.599 --> 01:49.486
...it's always negative things.

01:49.650 --> 01:52.950
Why not read a review of something where they've done something brilliant...

01:53.100 --> 01:54.200
...and they've been respected.

01:54.550 --> 02:00.350
And I also thought that the process of putting on an opera would be something, that would be...

02:01.100 --> 02:05.600
...would help people with their confidence and their communication skills.

02:06.400 --> 02:10.750
The process of theater and singing is really good for people's confidence and...

02:11.100 --> 02:14.000
....and how very quickly you can show someone...

02:14.450 --> 02:17.350
...that they can achieve great things when they didn't realize they could.
