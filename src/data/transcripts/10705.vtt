Hello! Welcome to Michael's Business Top Tips.

00:04.505 --> 00:07.040
This month, we're looking at time management.

00:07.605 --> 00:10.645
Now, this is a common problem for most business people,...

00:10.875 --> 00:12.780
...how to manage time effectively.

00:13.645 --> 00:17.250
I'd like to recommend three steps for time management.

00:18.150 --> 00:20.485
Step 1, activity log.

00:21.120 --> 00:26.025
This will help you understand how you're managing time presently.

00:27.045 --> 00:33.065
Keep a log, a record of everything you're doing in your work every day.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.165
Try this for one week.

00:35.865 --> 00:37.905
At the end of the week, look back.

00:38.270 --> 00:42.240
How much time are you spending on your different business activities?

00:43.845 --> 00:47.315
Step 2, try using a task list.

00:47.980 --> 00:52.785
Task list is when you list up all the activities or tasks you have to do.

00:53.620 --> 00:55.225
But don't stop there.

00:55.985 --> 00:58.590
Once that you've listed them, organize them.

01:00.025 --> 01:03.630
One nice way to organize them is A, B, C.

01:04.630 --> 01:09.235
Group A tasks, important and urgent.

01:10.270 --> 01:14.240
B tasks, important but not urgent.

01:15.240 --> 01:19.280
C tasks, not so important and not urgent.

01:20.145 --> 01:22.115
By having a different organization,...

01:22.450 --> 01:27.120
...this will help you understand which tasks should you spend most time on...

01:27.585 --> 01:30.590
...and which should you do first, second, third, et cetera.

01:32.525 --> 01:34.925
Final step, successful scheduling.

01:35.960 --> 01:43.535
Use your activity log and your task list to understand how best to schedule your time.

01:44.635 --> 01:46.535
A good technique here also,...

01:47.240 --> 01:50.575
...always give yourself contingency time.

01:56.415 --> 02:00.485
Contingency time means, kind of, emergency or backup time.

02:01.285 --> 02:04.225
If your schedule's too tight, it's not flexible.

02:04.725 --> 02:07.595
Something suddenly happens, you're in trouble.

02:08.060 --> 02:12.595
So give yourselves some blocks of contingency time just in case.

02:13.930 --> 02:17.470
So, try doing this technique today.

02:18.070 --> 02:22.205
After you've watched this video, start making your activity log for one week,...

02:22.675 --> 02:25.545
...then organize your task list and organize.

02:25.945 --> 02:28.615
And finally, introduce successful scheduling...

02:28.915 --> 02:30.915
...to help you manage time well.

02:31.585 --> 02:32.985
Thank you and good luck!
