Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:05.600 --> 00:06.850
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:07.400 --> 00:11.150
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:12.400 --> 00:15.300
By the way, do you guys know the word, "phone tag"?

00:16.300 --> 00:20.400
Phone tag is the word we use when you call somebody and you can't reach them.

00:20.700 --> 00:23.350
And then, they call you back, and they can't reach you.

00:23.650 --> 00:25.800
And in the end, you talk to them and say,...

00:25.900 --> 00:28.100
..."Oh, sorry. We were playing phone tag."

00:28.450 --> 00:29.900
It's a very useful word to know.

00:30.850 --> 00:32.950
Okay. Today's topic...

00:45.150 --> 00:46.450

00:47.500 --> 00:48.750
