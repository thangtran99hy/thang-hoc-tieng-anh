You know, like I said before, you know, I actually saw your video...

00:04.500 --> 00:09.500
...even before I had the chance to have this interview opportunity and,...

00:10.100 --> 00:13.900
...you know, it's really interesting to see the mix of hip-hop and then,...

00:14.700 --> 00:18.500
...some kind of mixing classical and jazz violin... going on and...

00:19.300 --> 00:22.400
...I just wanted to first get into your writing background history.

00:22.450 --> 00:27.650
...and you are... a guy from Los Angeles.

00:28.050 --> 00:32.050
And... are you still pretty much exposed to hip-hop music?

00:32.750 --> 00:35.700
Yeah! Well, a whole bunch of different styles of music are there, I mean.

00:36.700 --> 00:41.250
You know, I grew up on hip-hop, jazz also, classical, you know, classic rock.

00:42.350 --> 00:45.500
I love all kinds of music so I definitely think that, you know.

00:45.550 --> 00:47.050
And I was lucky enough to grow up in L.A.,...

00:47.100 --> 00:53.200
...where there's just a whole bunch of different cultures that are all mixed up in the city.

00:53.250 --> 00:58.250
So, you know, I'm very lucky to come from a very diverse city.

00:59.450 --> 01:02.650
Did you actually get exposed into some Japanese music as well?

01:03.850 --> 01:06.050
Just the children's songs that my parents taught me...

01:06.500 --> 01:08.950
...but I don't know too many of the artists here.

01:09.300 --> 01:10.950
Not one of those pop songs?

01:11.100 --> 01:13.150
Not too many. I know a couple...

01:13.300 --> 01:17.950
...like the songs you hear in the anime shows 'cause I'm a big fan of Bleach.

01:18.150 --> 01:18.800
Okay.

01:18.850 --> 01:21.050
So, the songs from Bleach, I know.

01:26.575 --> 01:30.850
I heard you started playing violin when you were four.

01:31.000 --> 01:31.300
Yeah.

01:31.350 --> 01:36.450
And you pretty much went on continuing until now, you never sort of... quit it.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.650
Why, I did for a little bit.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.350
When I went to college,...

01:42.300 --> 01:46.950
...my first day of university at USC, I said,...

01:47.000 --> 01:49.100
..."I don't wanna play violin anymore. I wanna do something else."

01:49.150 --> 01:52.350
So, I quit my major and I went to jazz school instead.

01:52.900 --> 01:56.150
And so, for that first year, I didn't really play violin too much.

01:56.200 --> 02:00.200
I did mostly vocal jazz training and stuff like that.

02:00.600 --> 02:07.200
And then after that, I realized well, jazz is great and I'm really having a good time...

02:07.250 --> 02:12.425
...but I'm wasting all this education that I've built up over the years with the violin.

02:12.475 --> 02:17.150
So, I should maybe try to combine the two or, you know, bring it back on my terms.
