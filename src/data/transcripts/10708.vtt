What's up with that? I mean, why did you actually decided on quitting...

00:03.300 --> 00:07.400
...right after spending pretty much, I don't know 16 or 14 years...

00:08.000 --> 00:10.250
...of, you know, having classical violin?

00:10.600 --> 00:16.400
Well, I really enjoyed doing a lot of different things in music...

00:16.450 --> 00:20.400
...and I wanna be the most, you know, the best musician that I can be.

00:20.650 --> 00:22.800
And I felt that if I just stayed with classical,...

00:22.850 --> 00:27.300
...I'm missing out on a lot of different types of music that are also a lot of fun...

00:27.350 --> 00:35.750
...like jazz and hip-hop. And so, I wanted to take a break from classical and try something new.

00:36.100 --> 00:38.200
And I'm really happy that I've made that decision...

00:38.350 --> 00:41.300
...because I think, it's made me a much better musician for it.

00:43.250 --> 00:46.200
This is your first time singing in Japanese, right?

00:46.400 --> 00:46.900
Yeah.

00:47.150 --> 00:51.800
And so, you seem to be like having fun at the same time struggling, and...

00:52.200 --> 00:53.750
...how are you coping with it?

00:56.180 --> 00:57.680
I'm sure you can speak some Japanese.

00:57.850 --> 01:00.550
I can but I keep making mistakes, like the other day,...

01:00.600 --> 01:06.000
...I wanted to say thank you for having us play for you, which is...

01:10.600 --> 01:11.800
...right? But I said,...

01:13.850 --> 01:15.400
And that's like totally wrong.

01:16.350 --> 01:17.100
Did you get run over?

01:17.150 --> 01:17.800
Yeah, it was like...

01:17.900 --> 01:21.900
...and then Stan, he's like,...

01:21.950 --> 01:24.400
...you just said, "Thank you for running me over with your car."

01:24.900 --> 01:26.500
That's not what I wanted to say!

01:28.150 --> 01:32.100
So, you know, it's a challenge and I get really nervous when I speak Japanese...

01:32.150 --> 01:34.850
...because I'm so scared that I'm gonna make that one mistake...

01:34.900 --> 01:37.400
...that totally changes the meaning of what I wanna say.

01:37.900 --> 01:43.450
So, I'm practicing as much as I can but I'm sure I'll keep making mistakes.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.250
At least, they're funny mistakes so it's okay.
