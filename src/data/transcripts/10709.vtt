00:03.160 --> 00:08.165
An awful woman lived with her daughter and stepdaughter in her household.

00:08.630 --> 00:12.295
She possessed feelings of hate for her stepdaughter, Ana.

00:13.125 --> 00:16.295
Ana worked while her stepsister did nothing.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.130
On a cold January night,...

00:19.525 --> 00:21.225
...Ana's stepmother remarked,...

00:21.560 --> 00:23.895
..."Your stepsister desires flowers."

00:24.155 --> 00:25.355
"Go and find some."

00:25.890 --> 00:29.715
Ana wasn't anxious to walk through the chilled landscape.

00:30.125 --> 00:32.625
The cold air made her lungs burn.

00:33.255 --> 00:36.520
She walked at a slow pace because of the snow.

00:37.020 --> 00:39.155
Soon, she saw a group of people.

00:39.720 --> 00:41.655
It consisted of 12 men.

00:42.355 --> 00:44.350
Ana told them about the flowers.

00:44.950 --> 00:49.550
One of the men said they were the twelve months and that they would help Ana.

00:50.315 --> 00:53.715
January walked to her and made a motion with his hand.

00:54.385 --> 00:58.750
The days of the month passed rapidly until it was February's turn.

00:59.625 --> 01:02.280
February also made the month speed up.

01:02.945 --> 01:05.145
Then, March made the sun shine...

01:05.375 --> 01:07.410
...and flowers grew in the field.

01:08.310 --> 01:13.400
Ana loaded her basket with so many flowers that she could hardly lift it.

01:14.005 --> 01:19.405
Then, she gave a quick but polite thank you to the 12 men and returned home.

01:20.105 --> 01:24.170
She was very eager to show her stepmother all the flowers.

01:25.005 --> 01:28.905
Back at the house, she spilled the flowers onto the table.

01:29.505 --> 01:32.735
Then, she told her stepmother about the 12 men.

01:33.535 --> 01:37.835
Ana's stepmother and stepsister went to seek the 12 months.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.350
Their intent was to ask for gifts.

01:42.035 --> 01:43.635
They looked and looked.

01:44.195 --> 01:48.130
They became very lost and never found their way home.

01:48.730 --> 01:51.160
Ana lived happily by herself.
