Last night, I went to a party called "The Intel Geek Party" and it was a blast.

00:07.640 --> 00:11.540
I expected a bunch of nerds playing with their computer all night,...

00:11.845 --> 00:15.615
...but instead, I came across incredibly creative people.

00:16.585 --> 00:21.220
Hence, this "dream booth" invented by Armella Leung,...

00:21.555 --> 00:25.255
...who calls herself a "multi medium graphic designer."

00:26.295 --> 00:32.065
It's made of a pillow on which dreams are displayed by a video projector.

00:32.895 --> 00:36.970
And of course, since the pillow has also built-in sensors,...

00:37.305 --> 00:40.005
...you can actually interact with your dreams.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.840
Who said computers are boring?
