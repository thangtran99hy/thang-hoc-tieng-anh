00:04.300 --> 00:05.750
Once, there was a shepherd.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.500
Every night, he counted and gathered his sheep.

00:08.750 --> 00:11.400
He was sure never to overlook any of them.

00:11.750 --> 00:15.050
One night, he saw some wild sheep had joined his herd.

00:15.300 --> 00:17.200
He hoped to acquire the newcomers.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.100
It snowed that night.

00:19.350 --> 00:22.800
In the morning, the shepherd couldn't take his sheep out of his lodge.

00:23.050 --> 00:25.350
Instead, he had to feed them inside.

00:25.650 --> 00:28.350
He gave a small amount of wheat to his own sheep.

00:28.550 --> 00:31.100
But he gave more of the food to the wild sheep.

00:31.300 --> 00:34.550
He thought the extra wheat would discourage them from leaving.

00:34.900 --> 00:36.700
It snowed for several days.

00:36.950 --> 00:40.150
During that time, the shepherd's sheep ate very little.

00:40.350 --> 00:42.700
The wild sheep however, ate very well.

00:43.050 --> 00:46.450
At last, the snow melted and they ventured outdoors.

00:46.750 --> 00:48.955
As soon as he opened the door of his hut,...

00:49.235 --> 00:51.301
...the wild sheep started to run away.

00:51.500 --> 00:53.600
"Wait! This is how you repay me?"

00:53.850 --> 00:58.200
"After I treated you so kindly, why do you run away?" the shepherd asked.

00:58.450 --> 01:00.150
His voice was full of hatred.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.750
The wild sheep stopped and turned toward the shepherd.

01:04.150 --> 01:07.300
"We're leaving because you fed us better than your own sheep,"...

01:07.500 --> 01:09.100
...one of the wild sheep replied.

01:09.250 --> 01:12.100
"You tried to deceive us with your ridiculous plan."

01:12.350 --> 01:16.250
"Yesterday, you treated us kindly, but tomorrow you might be different."

01:16.400 --> 01:20.700
"If more wild sheep joined your herd, you would treat us as inferior sheep."

01:21.100 --> 01:25.050
As the wild sheep ran away, the shepherd understood his offense.

01:25.300 --> 01:28.200
He knew this awkward situation was his own fault.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.950
He had not been a satisfactory caretaker.

01:31.150 --> 01:33.550
He was a fake friend to the wild sheep.

01:33.750 --> 01:36.200
Because of this, he had neglected his own herd.
