October 29th was the 40th anniversary of the very first message sent on the Internet.

00:11.217 --> 00:13.823
Now of course, we send billions of these messages a day.

00:14.279 --> 00:15.970
Hello, everybody. Welcome to 'Now You Know.'

00:16.086 --> 00:19.751
And do you know just what is the Internet? How does it work?

00:20.316 --> 00:22.778
Maybe we can thank the Soviet Union for the Internet.

00:23.127 --> 00:28.743
In 1957, the USSR launched into space the first artificial satellite Sputnik I,...

00:29.242 --> 00:31.294
....that jolted the White House and the Pentagon.

00:31.750 --> 00:34.305
If the Soviet Union could put a satellite into space,...

00:34.427 --> 00:38.431
...well, then they could put a nuclear ballistic missile into space,...

00:38.549 --> 00:41.719
...and they could basically attack us from space.

00:41.867 --> 00:44.717
So in 1958, US President Dwight Eisenhower...

00:44.829 --> 00:49.144
...established the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency or ARPA...

00:49.665 --> 00:54.708
...to help solve the problem of a breakdown in command, control, and communication...

00:54.984 --> 01:01.034
...in the event that we were a victim of a Soviet nuclear ballistic attack.

01:01.341 --> 01:04.623
And it was those people who came up with the basic ideas...

01:04.864 --> 01:07.915
...that eventually formed the framework and architecture for the Internet.

01:08.077 --> 01:11.101
In 1969, ARPA gave birth to the ARPANET.

01:11.244 --> 01:15.120
This was the very first fragment of the backbone of what is now our Internet.

01:15.266 --> 01:17.979
It consisted of four nodes or computer systems.

01:18.271 --> 01:20.934
Three nodes were in California, and one in Utah.

01:21.282 --> 01:24.170
One node at the University of California, Los Angeles...

01:24.496 --> 01:28.533
...was staffed by a team of computer techies led by Leonard Kleinrock.

01:28.785 --> 01:33.359
Kleinrock is absolutely one of the founding fathers and mothers of the Internet.

01:33.566 --> 01:38.965
It was Kleinrock who conceived the way messages would transmit from one point to another on the Internet.

01:39.277 --> 01:40.769
It's called packet switching,...

01:41.174 --> 01:44.390
...where a single message is broken up into smaller packets.

01:44.595 --> 01:49.158
...independently making their way through the network, arriving at the other end....

01:49.446 --> 01:50.829
...being put back together again,...

01:51.047 --> 01:54.269
...and delivered to you as an entity, as a long message.
