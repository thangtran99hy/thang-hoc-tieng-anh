00:02.300 --> 00:05.600
In a distant land, there was a kingdom where fairies lived.

00:05.870 --> 00:07.080
Tina was a fairy.

00:07.306 --> 00:10.295
She had yellow curls and wore a dress made of wool.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.310
She always moved with grace.

00:12.510 --> 00:16.785
However, because of her compact size, she was scared of mankind.

00:17.250 --> 00:19.715
One day, there was an eclipse of the sun.

00:19.985 --> 00:21.920
The fairies didn't know what was happening.

00:22.185 --> 00:24.355
They were scared, so they ran away.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.590
Tina looked for a place to hide.

00:26.890 --> 00:29.130
She found a garden with flowers blooming.

00:29.515 --> 00:31.490
Tina had a passion for flowers.

00:31.760 --> 00:33.065
She decided to hide there.

00:33.365 --> 00:36.275
She became sleepy and made a pillow with some leaves.

00:36.700 --> 00:40.175
She whistled happily as she worked and she fell asleep.

00:40.575 --> 00:44.310
Suddenly, somebody sneezed. The sound woke Tina up.

00:44.510 --> 00:46.845
She saw a very big face looking at her!

00:47.280 --> 00:49.680
Tina was so scared that she couldn't move.

00:49.885 --> 00:52.355
She could feel her pulse going very fast.

00:52.850 --> 00:54.755
The big woman went into her house.

00:54.985 --> 00:57.725
When she came back, she gave Tina a cup.

00:58.155 --> 01:01.260
The woman sat on the ground among some decaying leaves.

01:01.695 --> 01:04.430
Tina dipped a finger in the cup and tasted it.

01:04.765 --> 01:07.865
It was tea with all kinds of delicious spices in it.

01:08.265 --> 01:10.570
Tina felt refreshed after drinking the tea.

01:11.070 --> 01:16.275
"I'm Wilma.", the lady said. "I spend all my leisure time in my garden cutting flowers."

01:16.610 --> 01:17.820
"Would you like some dessert?"

01:18.545 --> 01:19.600
Tina said yes.

01:19.870 --> 01:22.554
She was hungry and she wasn't frightened anymore.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.685
She took a bite of cake and relaxed.

01:25.140 --> 01:26.535
"How did you get to my garden?"

01:27.120 --> 01:29.270
Tina told Wilma how she got lost.

01:29.655 --> 01:32.055
"That's terrible! Let us take you home."

01:32.555 --> 01:36.035
"Actually, I think that I want to stay with you.", Tina said.

01:36.460 --> 01:38.695
She wasn't scared of big people anymore.

01:39.030 --> 01:41.390
Wilma and Tina lived happily ever after.
