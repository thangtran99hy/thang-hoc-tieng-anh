Peter Parker lived next door to Mary Jane Watson.

00:08.950 --> 00:12.550
Peter liked MJ a lot, but he never told her.

00:13.150 --> 00:17.250
Peter took some photos of MJ with the spiders for the school newspaper.

00:17.950 --> 00:20.460
"Ow! What was that?", he thought.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.950
And there on the floor was a spider.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.050
When he woke up, he thought, "Am I dead?"

00:30.350 --> 00:31.700
"No!", he said.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.100
"I feel fantastic!"

00:35.800 --> 00:40.450
"Now," he thought, "I'm going to try this spider-webbing."

00:41.600 --> 00:43.800
He took a line of the webbing and jumped.

00:44.550 --> 00:47.350
"Woohoo! Now, I can fly!"

00:48.400 --> 00:51.450
Every day, terrible things happened in New York.

00:52.350 --> 00:54.650
Every day, Spider-Man helped people.

00:55.450 --> 00:56.400
But who was he?

00:57.200 --> 00:58.300
No one knew.

00:59.700 --> 01:03.950
With great power comes great responsibility.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.450
I'm strong and I'm a good person.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I must help other people.

01:11.900 --> 01:12.700
You know me.

01:13.450 --> 01:14.650
I'm Spider-Man!
