Sometimes, a person loves his house very much.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.150
Then he dies.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.750
That dead person can live in a house.

00:15.300 --> 00:18.150
It's in the walls and the floor.

00:18.900 --> 00:22.250
It's called, domus mactabilis.

00:22.700 --> 00:24.500
That means, monster house.

00:25.350 --> 00:26.400
It's Halloween.

00:26.900 --> 00:31.450
Tonight, there are going to be a lot of children at that door trick or treating!

00:32.000 --> 00:33.500
They're all going to die!

00:34.400 --> 00:36.700
Find the heart of the house.

00:37.350 --> 00:40.100
The heart must die.

00:40.950 --> 00:43.000
She's all I have.

00:43.500 --> 00:46.450
No, you have me too.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.400
I'm your friend.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.400
You were a bad girl.

00:52.050 --> 00:53.650
I must do this.

00:54.200 --> 00:57.900
Take this. I started it, you finish it.

00:58.950 --> 01:00.250
We did it.

01:00.550 --> 01:02.200
The house is dead!

01:02.950 --> 01:05.300
Constance is happy now...

01:06.400 --> 01:08.950
...and I can live my life.

01:09.950 --> 01:10.600
Thank you.
