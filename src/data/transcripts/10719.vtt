00:02.455 --> 00:05.364
Many different cultures have had traditions about the dead.

00:05.949 --> 00:11.709
People in places like Ireland, China, Egypt and Mexico believed that souls needed food.

00:12.026 --> 00:15.848
They thought the food nourished them on their journey from cemeteries to heaven.

00:16.472 --> 00:19.095
People had to put out good things for souls to eat.

00:19.590 --> 00:22.989
However, if the food rotted or spoiled, the soul got mad.

00:23.474 --> 00:27.319
The wicked soul might curse the family and make them starve during the winter.

00:27.861 --> 00:33.051
In other places, people begged for food on a holiday that remembers the souls of dead saints.

00:33.613 --> 00:36.879
People wore disguises with hoods that covered their faces.

00:37.367 --> 00:40.153
If they did not get food, they played a trick on the home.

00:40.755 --> 00:44.037
For this reason, the activity is known as trick-or-treating.

00:44.583 --> 00:47.389
Shortly after people first began trick-or-treating,...

00:47.735 --> 00:50.644
...parents started sending their children to beg on that day.

00:51.278 --> 00:55.130
Housewives gave the children food if they performed a song or a dance.

00:55.732 --> 00:58.467
When people moved to America from all over the world,...

00:58.659 --> 01:00.337
...they brought this tradition with them.

01:00.789 --> 01:04.500
Inhabitants of villages started trick-or-treating in the early 1900s.

01:05.107 --> 01:10.009
In 1939, a children's publication acquainted the whole country with the tradition.

01:10.485 --> 01:11.746
It became very popular.

01:12.342 --> 01:16.609
Today, trick-or-treaters are not begging for food and they are not scared of souls.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.847
They just enjoy the thrill of dressing up like creatures and getting candy.

01:21.451 --> 01:24.191
Ghosts and skeletons are favorite costumes,...

01:24.547 --> 01:27.711
...but some children wear fancy disguises like pirates.

01:28.187 --> 01:30.334
They carry flashlights instead of fires.

01:30.755 --> 01:34.908
In some places, children still perform songs or riddles to get candy.

01:35.401 --> 01:38.475
But most of the time, they just say, "Trick or treat!".
