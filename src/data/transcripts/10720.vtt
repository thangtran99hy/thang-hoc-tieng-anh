WEBVTT

00:04.300 --> 00:05.600
We have a problem.

00:05.900 --> 00:07.650
Move President McKenna!

00:08.600 --> 00:12.550
Do you really want to start a fight between humans and mutants?

00:14.250 --> 00:16.050
It has always been a fight...

00:16.650 --> 00:18.750
...and we are going to win.

00:19.950 --> 00:23.150
These lights are all the humans in the world.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.050
The red lights are the mutants.

00:26.400 --> 00:30.300
Cerebro allows me to see their minds.

00:30.750 --> 00:32.500
Can't you just think harder?

00:33.350 --> 00:35.600
If I want to kill him, yes.

00:35.850 --> 00:39.000
Have you come to save me, Charles?

00:39.750 --> 00:41.050
Not today, Eric.

00:41.550 --> 00:42.700
Let's go!

00:43.100 --> 00:44.900
Who was that man?

00:45.300 --> 00:46.700
His name's Stryker.

00:47.900 --> 00:50.200
Never forget this, Pyro.

00:50.850 --> 00:54.850
Next to you, humans are nothing.

00:56.650 --> 00:58.700
Cyclops, don't do this!

00:59.750 --> 01:02.100
It's going to get very cold in here.

01:04.750 --> 01:06.500
Is everything OK, Professor?

01:07.300 --> 01:10.100
Yes. I think it will be.
