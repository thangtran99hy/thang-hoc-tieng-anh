00:00.350 --> 00:04.600
At UCLA in 1969, the very first Internet message was sent.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.300
Kleinrock's team of computer scientists sent it to another team of computer wizards...

00:08.450 --> 00:10.550
...at the Stanford Research Institute.

00:11.100 --> 00:14.700
That first message was supposed to be the word "log" as in "log in".

00:15.300 --> 00:17.350
Charlie typed the "L". He said, "Did you get the L?"

00:17.900 --> 00:18.900
"Yup! I got the L."

00:19.400 --> 00:21.100
"Type the O. Got the O?"

00:21.600 --> 00:22.200
"I got the O."

00:22.500 --> 00:23.600
"Type the G. Did you get the G?"

00:24.050 --> 00:24.600
Crash!

00:25.200 --> 00:26.950
The SRI computer crashed.

00:27.550 --> 00:31.800
So the first message ever on the Internet was "lo"!...

00:32.300 --> 00:34.100
...as in "lo and behold."

00:34.550 --> 00:38.200
Just a few years later, the very first e-mail was sent on this ARPANET system.

00:38.350 --> 00:44.200
Ray Tomlinson wrote the code that allowed text messages to be sent to users on different computers...

00:44.400 --> 00:46.200
...rather than to one shared computer.

00:46.350 --> 00:48.500
Scientists began to share personal messages with each other.

00:49.000 --> 00:49.900
"How are the wife and kids?"

00:50.200 --> 00:51.900
You know, "How are you doing? When are you gonna go to this conference?"

00:52.000 --> 00:54.200
Or "What are you gonna do on your summer vacation?"

00:54.670 --> 00:58.300
At this point in the 1970s, the spread of the Internet was still an apparatus...

00:58.450 --> 01:01.800
...used by a select elite few, mostly from the world of academia.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.600
It was the introduction of the personal computer in 1981...

01:06.100 --> 01:09.200
...that started the massive migration of humanity to the Internet.

01:09.850 --> 01:12.350
When IBM came out with the PC and Microsoft came up with DOS,...

01:12.800 --> 01:14.700
...that's what put it into the hands of normal people.
