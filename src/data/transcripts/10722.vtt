00:04.750 --> 00:06.350
She looks at me every day.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.100
Mary Jane Watson.

00:10.400 --> 00:11.150
I love her.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.050
But she doesn't know.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.050
She can never know.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.100
Who am I?

00:18.100 --> 00:22.000
I'm Spider-Man and I have an important job to do.

00:22.750 --> 00:25.100
Everyone's talking about it!

00:25.450 --> 00:29.150
A crazy scientist with four metal arms.

00:30.850 --> 00:34.250
Dr. Octopus! Doc Ock!

00:35.500 --> 00:38.300
I can't live your dreams anymore, Uncle Ben.

00:38.950 --> 00:40.400
I can't be Spider-Man.

00:41.300 --> 00:42.900
I want a life of my own.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.100
Peter, I'm getting married.

00:47.100 --> 00:49.250
There never was a you and me, Peter.

00:50.050 --> 00:54.200
Crime up, 75%. Where is Spider-Man now?

00:55.100 --> 00:56.750
It's all my fault.

00:57.650 --> 01:00.200
I drove Spider-Man away.

01:00.850 --> 01:02.650
Spider-Man was a hero.

01:03.100 --> 01:06.700
If you're with Spider-Man, you're always in danger.

01:07.550 --> 01:09.500
I will always be Spider-Man.

01:10.100 --> 01:12.200
You and I can never be together.

01:15.650 --> 01:19.600
Find him or I'll kill her.
