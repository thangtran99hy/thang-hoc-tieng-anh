00:04.250 --> 00:06.650
You're not frightened of me, are you, Bruce?

00:07.350 --> 00:09.550
What are you frightened of?

00:09.950 --> 00:13.450
Things are very bad in Gotham now, Master Bruce.

00:14.450 --> 00:16.750
I'm going to save Gotham, Alfred.

00:17.250 --> 00:19.100
We don't need his help!

00:19.400 --> 00:22.100
Well, I think we probably do.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.500
Gotham must die.

00:25.200 --> 00:26.800
When Gotham dies,...

00:27.300 --> 00:29.600
...people everywhere will be frightened.

00:30.300 --> 00:32.250
The world will be wonderful again.

00:33.150 --> 00:36.100
Great people can't always choose their lives.

00:36.950 --> 00:38.150
Gotham needs you.

00:39.550 --> 00:41.000
I'm Batman.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.850
Everything changes tonight.
