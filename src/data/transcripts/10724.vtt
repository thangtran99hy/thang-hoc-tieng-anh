00:04.550 --> 00:07.800
It's Saturday morning and I'm at the boxing club at the social.

00:08.500 --> 00:12.500
One and two. And three, and four. And hit, and bang.

00:13.600 --> 00:16.300
On the other side of the room, there's a ballet class.

00:17.100 --> 00:17.800
I try it.

00:18.550 --> 00:19.500
Debbie laughs at me.

00:20.350 --> 00:21.400
Your leg's moving!

00:22.550 --> 00:23.900
I think about Fred Astaire.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.250
I want to dance like him.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.100
I run and jump down the road.

00:29.750 --> 00:31.500
"I don't know the moves, Miss.", I said.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.100
Follow the girls.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.900
Go to the back and watch them.

00:35.700 --> 00:39.000
Billy, I'm thinking about the Royal Ballet School.

00:39.700 --> 00:42.650
There's an audition in Newcastle in two weeks.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.200
What?! Ballet?!

00:46.000 --> 00:49.500
My brother does not do ballet, you stupid woman!

00:50.100 --> 00:51.300
I walked over to him.

00:52.300 --> 00:54.300
And then, I did my audition dance.

00:55.150 --> 00:56.600
I jumped and spun.

00:57.300 --> 00:59.100
I wanted to show dad everything.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.600
How do you feel when you dance?

01:03.800 --> 01:05.250
I forget the world...

01:05.850 --> 01:08.400
...and the strike, and everything.

01:09.550 --> 01:11.150
There's fire in my body.

01:12.150 --> 01:12.750
It's like...

01:14.450 --> 01:15.850
...it's like flying.
