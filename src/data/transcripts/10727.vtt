00:10.650 --> 00:13.050
Suddenly, the sky was dark.

00:13.850 --> 00:16.150
There were hundreds of meteors in the sky.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.700
Jonathan and Martha Kent were on their way home.

00:20.350 --> 00:23.300

A spaceship crashed into the road in front of them.

00:38.550 --> 00:41.500

00:44.750 --> 00:47.700
They didn't want Clark to be different from other children.

00:48.350 --> 00:49.550

00:53.800 --> 00:55.150
He was very fast.

00:55.900 --> 00:57.150
Nothing hurt him.
