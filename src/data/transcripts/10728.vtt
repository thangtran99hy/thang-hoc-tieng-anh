00:04.050 --> 00:06.350
It's three years since she died.

00:07.300 --> 00:09.050
Time goes too fast.

00:10.500 --> 00:11.900
Not fast enough.

00:12.650 --> 00:14.300
Why isn't your son here?

00:15.350 --> 00:17.000
Did I do something wrong?

00:18.500 --> 00:22.800
No, but sometimes, it's not easy to be your son.

00:23.750 --> 00:25.700
You're living in the past!

00:26.450 --> 00:28.800
Yesterday, wasn't so great!

00:30.000 --> 00:33.600
Another quick and easy win for Mason Dixon...

00:33.750 --> 00:35.850
...and the crowd is angry!

00:37.300 --> 00:40.800
Maybe next time, Dixon will choose a real opponent.

00:41.150 --> 00:43.300
But is there anyone out there?

00:44.400 --> 00:46.050
You need respect.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.800
You need to test yourself in the ring.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.850
You need a hard fight.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.350
And then, you will have the only kind of respect you need.

00:59.050 --> 01:01.150
You will have respect for yourself.

01:02.450 --> 01:05.750
Mason Dixon heard about your license.

01:06.150 --> 01:08.350
He'd like to do something with you.

01:09.300 --> 01:11.450
An exhibition match.

01:12.300 --> 01:13.700
I want to do something.

01:15.150 --> 01:16.400
I want to fight again.

01:17.900 --> 01:19.900
It's a different world now, Dad.

01:21.700 --> 01:23.300
Time catches all of us.

01:24.400 --> 01:28.150
Time only catches you if you stand still.
