00:04.650 --> 00:06.100
Where are you, Buffy?

00:07.100 --> 00:08.100
Why am I here?

00:09.600 --> 00:11.950
Buffy was almost at the Bronze.

00:12.850 --> 00:16.850
It was the end of October, two nights before Halloween.

00:17.950 --> 00:20.250
The evening was black and cold.

00:21.600 --> 00:25.650
Suddenly, something hit Buffy on the back of her head.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.700
She pulled a stake from her jacket.

00:29.600 --> 00:32.450
Soon, it was in the vampire's body.

00:33.600 --> 00:34.900
No more vampire.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.300
Wow! Look at her.

00:40.850 --> 00:41.750
Who is she?

00:43.900 --> 00:47.150
Buffy. Buffy must die.

00:47.850 --> 00:50.200
Drusilla needs more blood...

00:50.700 --> 00:54.300
...but that slayer makes it so difficult.

00:55.900 --> 00:59.150
Oh no! I'm a ghost.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.800
I'm Willow's ghost.

01:03.550 --> 01:06.450
Buffy? Are you OK?

01:07.500 --> 01:10.350
What? Who is Buffy?

01:11.300 --> 01:12.650
She's not Buffy.

01:13.900 --> 01:15.100
Who's Buffy?

01:16.100 --> 01:17.450
My little one.

01:18.250 --> 01:22.600
Frightened. Alone. No one can help you now.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.050
What's going to happen to us without the slayer?
