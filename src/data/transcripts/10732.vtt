00:04.350 --> 00:08.000
I'm going to go to the beach in Cannes!

00:08.700 --> 00:11.850
But the train to Cannes left from a different station.

00:12.550 --> 00:16.250
He didn't want to go the wrong way and so he used a compass.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.500
He was at the station!

00:19.200 --> 00:22.150
He asked a man to film him as he got on the train.

00:23.300 --> 00:28.800
Mr. Bean watched as the train left the station with all of his bags on it.

00:29.900 --> 00:33.600
Mr. Bean sat opposite the Russian boy and smiled.

00:34.550 --> 00:38.750
The boy, Stepan, gave him a long, cold look.

00:39.550 --> 00:43.100
He was alone in France because of this stupid man.

00:43.900 --> 00:45.700
Some musicians were in the street.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.950
Mr. Bean started to dance.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.100
They started to give him money.

00:53.050 --> 00:55.500
He was in a beautiful little French town.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.900
There was a big explosion.

00:58.750 --> 01:03.350
Then, some German soldiers followed the tank and ran into the town.

01:04.300 --> 01:06.200
But what about Mr. Bean?

01:07.500 --> 01:10.300
He only cared about one thing.

01:10.950 --> 01:11.950
The beach!
