00:04.135 --> 00:05.805
This is a true story.

00:06.197 --> 00:08.475
It happened long ago in Greece.

00:09.475 --> 00:14.555
"We must fight," the Spartan chief told his small army of brave men.

00:15.215 --> 00:17.385
They were at a great disadvantage.

00:17.785 --> 00:20.005
There were only 300 of them.

00:20.620 --> 00:24.225
The Persian military had hundreds of thousands of men.

00:24.690 --> 00:29.195
They were going to lose unless they could secure a small entrance.

00:29.795 --> 00:32.165
The enemy couldn't move through it easily.

00:32.735 --> 00:35.380
They intended to stop the enemy here.

00:36.035 --> 00:39.040
The chief and his men got ready for the battle.

00:39.440 --> 00:44.245
Soon, long lines of the enemy's army twisted around the hills.

00:44.675 --> 00:47.215
The chief met the enemy with laughter.

00:47.650 --> 00:51.020
He knew that his men's weapons and skills were better.

00:51.550 --> 00:54.655
The Spartans trusted their leader and obeyed him.

00:55.300 --> 00:59.395
First, the enemy soldiers shot arrows from their bows.

00:59.880 --> 01:03.025
The chief told his men to lift their shields.

01:03.430 --> 01:07.965
The arrows stuck into the shields but did not hurt any of the men.

01:08.665 --> 01:13.275
Then, the enemy's soldiers attacked the Spartans with long spears.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.505
The chief surprised them.

01:15.975 --> 01:19.080
His troops rolled logs down on the enemy.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.415
They fought for three days.

01:22.015 --> 01:26.755
Though they hardly slept at all, the chief and his men remained steady.

01:27.420 --> 01:30.790
But the enemy found a way to beat the Spartans.

01:31.290 --> 01:34.060
The chief and all of his men were killed.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.095
Even though they lost,...

01:36.295 --> 01:40.735
...the Battle of Thermopylae is one of the most famous battles in history.
