00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
French football coach dead!

00:06.400 --> 00:08.650
Killer takes Pink Panther.

00:09.350 --> 00:11.750
I know the right man for the job.

00:12.250 --> 00:15.050
Find him and bring him to Paris.

00:15.500 --> 00:19.300
His name is Jacques Clouseau.

00:20.500 --> 00:24.450
She's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

00:25.450 --> 00:26.900
Bizu is dead!

00:27.200 --> 00:28.650
He was in the changing room.

00:29.200 --> 00:31.000
The killer shot him in the head.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.800
Xania isn't the killer.

00:35.650 --> 00:36.650
Where is she now?

00:37.700 --> 00:40.100
She left suddenly for New York.

00:40.850 --> 00:43.400
And where is this New York?

00:45.200 --> 00:48.100
In the United States of America.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.400
There is nowhere you can hide.

00:51.850 --> 00:54.200
Killer, I will find you!

00:54.450 --> 00:57.500
Because I am Inspector Clouseau.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.650
Because detectives are detectives.

01:00.800 --> 01:04.550
And France is France!
