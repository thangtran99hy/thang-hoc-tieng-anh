00:04.100 --> 00:05.400
My life is hell.

00:06.150 --> 00:08.100
I want to get out of Chino.

00:08.800 --> 00:09.650
Listen to me.

00:10.050 --> 00:13.700
I haven't learned much in my life but I know one thing.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.050
Dreams don't come true.

00:17.250 --> 00:19.750
He's right, not in Chino.

00:21.100 --> 00:23.600
Ryan, you're a clever kid.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.800
Have you thought about your future?

00:29.000 --> 00:31.500
In Chino, you don't have dreams.

00:32.150 --> 00:34.050
Dreams don't come true.

00:35.300 --> 00:38.900
He stole a car and you brought him home?

00:39.800 --> 00:41.700
She's so beautiful.

00:42.750 --> 00:43.500
Who are you?

00:44.850 --> 00:46.100
Anyone you want.

00:46.900 --> 00:47.850
Who's that?

00:48.350 --> 00:49.450
He's cute!

00:50.200 --> 00:51.800
I don't really know.

00:52.550 --> 00:54.500
Well, I plan to find out.

00:55.350 --> 00:56.950
Welcome to the O.C.!

00:57.600 --> 01:01.100
If I ever see you here again, you're dead. Dead!

01:02.650 --> 01:04.250
I don't know what to say.

01:04.650 --> 01:07.300
Tonight was fantastic.

01:07.650 --> 01:09.500
You were totally there for me.

01:09.850 --> 01:12.000
You were like Brad Pitt in Fight Club!

01:12.650 --> 01:14.700
Maybe you could teach me how to fight...

01:15.100 --> 01:16.700
...and next time, we'll win!

01:20.750 --> 01:22.600
Welcome to the dark side.
