00:00.850 --> 00:03.470
Our administration has had some political setbacks this year....

00:06.005 --> 00:07.175
...and some of them were deserved.

00:10.440 --> 00:11.845
But I wake up every day...

00:12.845 --> 00:14.215
...knowing that they are nothing...

00:15.115 --> 00:19.185
...compared to the setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year.

00:21.985 --> 00:23.020
And what keeps me going,...

00:24.360 --> 00:25.325
...what keeps me fighting...

00:26.525 --> 00:28.460
...is that despite all these setbacks,...

00:29.395 --> 00:32.600
...that spirit of determination and optimism,...

00:33.600 --> 00:38.005
...that fundamental decency that has always been at the core of the American people,...

00:39.175 --> 00:39.910
...that lives on.

00:42.175 --> 00:46.915
It lives on in the struggling small business owner who wrote to me of his company.

00:48.380 --> 00:49.385
None of us, he said,...

00:50.050 --> 00:54.750
...are willing to consider, even slightly, that we might fail.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.325
It lives on in the woman who said, that...

00:59.695 --> 01:02.765
...even though she and her neighbors have felt the pain of recession,...

01:03.760 --> 01:04.800
..."We are strong."

01:05.800 --> 01:06.835
"We are resilient."

01:07.870 --> 01:08.650
"We are American."

01:11.370 --> 01:14.575
It lives on in the 8-year-old boy in Louisiana...

01:15.275 --> 01:19.145
...who just sent me his allowance and asked if I would give it to the people of Haiti.

01:21.845 --> 01:24.130
And it lives on in all the Americans...

01:24.885 --> 01:28.420
...who've dropped everything to go someplace they've never been...

01:29.520 --> 01:32.255
...and pull people they've never known from the rubble,...

01:33.725 --> 01:40.900
...prompting chants of "U.S.A. U.S.A. U.S.A." when another life was saved.

01:43.300 --> 01:49.740
The spirit that has sustained this nation for more than two centuries lives on in you,...

01:50.775 --> 01:51.510
...its people.

01:53.810 --> 01:55.180
We have finished a difficult year.

01:56.515 --> 01:58.285
We have come through a difficult decade.

01:59.855 --> 02:00.985
But a new year has come.

02:02.185 --> 02:04.390
A new decade stretches before us.

02:05.290 --> 02:06.595
We don't quit.

02:07.595 --> 02:08.560
I don't quit.

02:09.225 --> 02:10.465
Let's seize this moment...

02:11.030 --> 02:11.965
...to start anew,...

02:12.460 --> 02:13.830
...to carry the dream forward...

02:14.435 --> 02:16.405
...and to strengthen our union once more.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.300
Thank you! God bless you!

02:18.805 --> 02:20.640
And God bless the United States of America.
