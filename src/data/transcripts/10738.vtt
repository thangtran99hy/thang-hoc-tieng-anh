500 years ago,...

00:06.550 --> 00:13.300
...the Inca people of Peru chose a beautiful teenage girl as their princess.

00:14.200 --> 00:18.050
The Incas needed to make a religious sacrifice.

00:18.850 --> 00:22.100
They chose their princess as the sacrifice.

00:23.450 --> 00:27.400
They put her in a sarcophagus while she was still living.

00:28.300 --> 00:30.600
Then, they left her forever.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.650
Rodney's disappeared,...

00:34.650 --> 00:36.900
...he didn't come home last night.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.250
The police are looking for him.

00:39.900 --> 00:43.650
Rodney's body looked so dead.

00:44.050 --> 00:48.250
Yeah, 500 years dead. But why?

00:49.650 --> 00:53.300
Hello, I'm Ampata.

00:54.600 --> 00:57.200
Hi, I'm Buffy Summers...

00:57.700 --> 01:02.450
...and these are my friends Xander and Willow.

01:03.150 --> 01:04.750
I'm sorry we're so late.

01:06.750 --> 01:08.200
Pleased to meet you.

01:08.900 --> 01:13.500
I have something to tell you and it's a little bit scary.

01:14.650 --> 01:15.450
What is it?

01:16.650 --> 01:20.050
Well, I really like you.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.400
Will you come to the dance with me?

01:23.950 --> 01:27.650
What girl travels with a mummy and doesn't bring makeup?

01:29.300 --> 01:31.400
Ampata is our mummy!

01:32.450 --> 01:33.550
And our killer!

01:34.400 --> 01:37.400
Giles, she's at the dance with Xander!
