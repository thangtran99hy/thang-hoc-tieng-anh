00:04.200 --> 00:06.400
The mine is too dangerous.

00:06.850 --> 00:09.050
We can't work here anymore.

00:09.950 --> 00:13.350
We will have miners. New miners.

00:14.450 --> 00:16.500
Quick, Robin! We've got one!

00:17.100 --> 00:19.550
A cart's fallen into our hole!

00:20.800 --> 00:21.550
Who are they?

00:22.150 --> 00:23.250
Where are you taking them?

00:23.850 --> 00:27.000
They're new workers for the sheriff's mine.

00:27.500 --> 00:28.800
They're slaves.

00:29.450 --> 00:32.100
The sheriff is buying people.

00:33.050 --> 00:35.750
Djaq, we will help you to escape.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.850
We want to close the mine.

00:38.650 --> 00:41.950
One of you is going to travel in the cart as a slave.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.000
You'll look really ill.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.400
The guards will think you have the disease.

00:47.900 --> 00:50.050
They'll be frightened and run away.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.750
Forget Robin Hood!

00:53.100 --> 00:55.050
Save the mine!

00:55.850 --> 00:58.300
Never forget Robin Hood!
