Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:05.400 --> 00:06.600
I am your maitre d' Seita.

00:07.150 --> 00:10.500
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.500
Alright, in Japanese we often use the term...

00:16.050 --> 00:18.750
...as a reference to when something changes in your life that's important.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.850
In English, we more often use the word "a milestone".

00:23.850 --> 00:25.550
This was a milestone in my life.

00:26.350 --> 00:31.200
So, turning point is okay but we often use the word "milestone", so please use both.

00:31.900 --> 00:34.250
Okay, today's topic...

00:48.700 --> 00:51.000
For example, go for it.

00:52.050 --> 00:52.800
Go for it.

00:59.350 --> 01:00.500
I wanna be a doctor.

01:00.900 --> 01:02.400
Oh! Go for it!

01:10.000 --> 01:10.800
And another one,...

01:12.750 --> 01:13.600
...keep it up.

01:14.650 --> 01:15.350
Keep it up.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.100
I'm on a diet.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.900
Oh, good! Keep it up!

01:30.050 --> 01:32.500
So, use this for someone that's trying hard.

01:34.050 --> 01:35.500
And last but not least,...

01:37.200 --> 01:37.900
...hang in there.

01:38.900 --> 01:39.550
Hang in there.

01:46.750 --> 01:48.650
Yeah, my team just can't win.

01:49.550 --> 01:51.300
Oh! But, hang in there!

01:59.100 --> 02:01.950
Alright, there are many different types of...

02:02.750 --> 02:04.000
Alright, let's repeat.

02:05.050 --> 02:07.150
First one is go for it.

02:08.250 --> 02:08.950
Please repeat.

02:10.500 --> 02:10.900
Good.

02:12.450 --> 02:14.750
The second one is oh, keep it up.

02:15.700 --> 02:16.450
Keep it up.

02:18.400 --> 02:18.850
Good.

02:19.550 --> 02:21.800
And the third one is hang in there.

02:22.450 --> 02:23.200
Hang in there.

02:26.050 --> 02:26.450
Good.

02:27.300 --> 02:29.150
There are a lot of different types of phrases, so...

02:29.350 --> 02:32.050
...use the best one, and you'll sound more and more like a native.

02:32.750 --> 02:34.850
Okay, that's it for today.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.800
And next week, there'll be more for you in the Native Maestro...

02:37.850 --> 02:39.800
...helping you to become the native maestro.

02:40.250 --> 02:40.700
