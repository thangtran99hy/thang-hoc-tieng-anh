00:03.950 --> 00:05.450
A long time ago,...

00:05.800 --> 00:09.950
...before the Egyptians, the Cambodians or the Aztecs,...

00:10.300 --> 00:12.650
...Antarctica had no ice.

00:13.250 --> 00:14.600
People lived here.

00:15.650 --> 00:17.150
Bouvetoya Island.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.350
But it's not on the ice.

00:21.350 --> 00:24.300
It's 600 meters under it.

00:25.600 --> 00:26.850
Find somebody else.

00:27.550 --> 00:31.650
Will we do better with you or without you?

00:32.850 --> 00:35.250
My job is to keep you all safe...

00:35.750 --> 00:36.800
...and you can help me.

00:37.700 --> 00:39.600
Never go anywhere alone.

00:40.200 --> 00:43.600
Be ready, bad things can happen on the ice.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.550
I don't understand it.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.650
There's nothing here.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.250
No sign of another team.

00:52.300 --> 00:54.450
When they gave their lives,...

00:54.850 --> 00:56.350
...the hunt could start.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.150
This is unusual.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.900
I think something broke out of this body.

01:02.900 --> 01:05.500
The thing on the roof was a Predator.

01:06.050 --> 01:06.950
It was time,...

01:08.100 --> 01:10.300
...time for them to go to the pyramid.

01:11.150 --> 01:13.700
These were the Alien Queen's eggs...

01:14.200 --> 01:17.150
...and the things inside them were new aliens.

01:17.850 --> 01:19.250
There was no way out.
