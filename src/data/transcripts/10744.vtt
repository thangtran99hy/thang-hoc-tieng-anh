Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.350
I am your maitre d' Seita.

00:08.100 --> 00:11.400
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:12.400 --> 00:13.900
Alright. By the way,...

00:14.800 --> 00:17.550
...this mark means money in Japanese, right?

00:18.050 --> 00:19.150
But this is only in Japan.

00:19.450 --> 00:20.700
Do you know how we do it in the States?

00:21.500 --> 00:24.450
We go like this because most money is paper in America.

00:24.950 --> 00:27.100
So, when someone goes like this we're talking about money.

00:28.250 --> 00:32.200
But be careful, both of them are not so polite. So, be careful where you use it, okay?

00:33.450 --> 00:35.000
Alright. Today's topic...

00:52.300 --> 00:53.350
The change is for you.

00:54.150 --> 00:55.150
The change is for you.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.600
Thank you! The change is for you.

01:18.900 --> 01:19.700
This is for you.

01:20.650 --> 01:21.450
This is for you.

01:29.900 --> 01:31.450
Thank you! This is for you.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.350
The tip's on the table.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.400
The tip's on the table.

01:53.550 --> 01:56.600
Thank you! The tip's for you, it's on the table.

02:02.100 --> 02:03.350
Okay, let's practice.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.450
First, the change is for you.

02:07.550 --> 02:08.450
The change is for you.

02:09.800 --> 02:10.500
Please repeat.

02:12.600 --> 02:12.950
Good.

02:14.350 --> 02:17.450
And second, this is for you.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.100
This is for you.

02:21.100 --> 02:21.650
Repeat.

02:22.500 --> 02:22.850
Good.

02:23.700 --> 02:26.700
And last, put the tip there and say,...

02:26.950 --> 02:29.000
..."Thanks! The tip's on the table."

02:29.700 --> 02:30.750
The tip's on the table.

02:32.100 --> 02:32.700
Alright.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.050
Use English like this and you'll all be a native very soon.

02:37.800 --> 02:39.450
Thank you very much!
