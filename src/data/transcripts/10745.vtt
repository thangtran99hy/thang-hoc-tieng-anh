00:04.400 --> 00:06.150
I was not like anyone there.

00:06.900 --> 00:10.050
Nobody loved me and I loved nobody.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.450
Her name is Jane Eyre.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.800
She looks like an ordinary child.

00:17.150 --> 00:18.250
But she is not!

00:18.950 --> 00:19.900
Watch her!

00:21.050 --> 00:23.350
Helen and I became good friends.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
But in May, the typhoid fever came.

00:27.850 --> 00:29.850
Helen was dead in my arms.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.300
I stayed there for eight more years.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.000
Six as a student and two as a teacher.

00:37.750 --> 00:41.250
One evening, I looked out at the far mountains.

00:41.950 --> 00:43.800
The real world was out there.

00:45.050 --> 00:47.650
I decided to advertise in the newspaper.

00:49.150 --> 00:50.850
I had one answer.

00:51.800 --> 00:56.850
The letter came from Mrs. Fairfax of Thornfield, near Millcote.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.800
Six weeks later, I left Lowood.

01:01.800 --> 01:05.050
I was 18 and alone in the world.
