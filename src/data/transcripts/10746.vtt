00:03.950 --> 00:06.000
A deer told himself every day,...

00:06.650 --> 00:09.350
..."I am the most handsome deer in the forest."

00:10.150 --> 00:13.000
"My large chest is a symbol of my power...

00:13.850 --> 00:16.650
...and my beautiful horns impress other animals."

00:17.600 --> 00:20.000
But he did not like his legs and hooves.

00:20.700 --> 00:23.800
"My legs are narrow and my hooves are ugly."

00:24.450 --> 00:25.950
"They do not satisfy me."

00:26.700 --> 00:29.450
One day, the deer saw a big dog.

00:30.350 --> 00:32.800
The deer made some noise and disturbed the dog.

00:33.750 --> 00:35.500
The dog woke up and chased him.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.700
The deer felt terror.

00:38.250 --> 00:39.200
He screamed.

00:39.950 --> 00:43.600
He did not want to be a victim, so he ran into the forest.

00:44.150 --> 00:46.350
His strong legs helped him run fast.

00:46.900 --> 00:49.000
His pale brown hooves were hard,...

00:49.300 --> 00:51.450
...so they were not sensitive to rough rocks.

00:52.100 --> 00:56.550
However, his horns got caught in branches, slowing him down.

00:57.500 --> 01:00.500
His large chest could not fit between thick trees.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.800
The deer estimated that he ran for an hour.

01:04.600 --> 01:06.550
He felt like he was running a marathon.

01:07.350 --> 01:10.350
In the end, the deer escaped the threat of the dog.

01:11.300 --> 01:12.950
He sat in the shade of a tree.

01:13.900 --> 01:15.800
"That was almost a disaster!"

01:16.400 --> 01:19.700
"I almost did not escape because of my chest and horns."

01:20.450 --> 01:22.200
"My legs and hooves saved me."

01:23.350 --> 01:27.100
As a consequence, the deer learned to honor his fast legs...

01:27.450 --> 01:29.500
...and have confidence in his strong hooves.

01:30.050 --> 01:33.700
"Pretty things only supplement important things.", he thought.
