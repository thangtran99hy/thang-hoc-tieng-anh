00:01.343 --> 00:04.431
This team knows that being a champ is about more than trophies and rings.

00:05.121 --> 00:07.067
It's about being a winner off the court as well as on it.

00:07.394 --> 00:09.293
And giving back to those who are less fortunate.

00:09.451 --> 00:12.308
The Lakers and the NBA have always been about serving others.

00:12.678 --> 00:16.194
Earlier today, the team joined with our United We Serve Initiative...

00:16.315 --> 00:21.057
...to hold a fitness clinic for kids from Stanton Elementary School right here in Washington, D.C.

00:21.477 --> 00:25.037
Teaching them a few moves, but also how to live healthy and active lives.

00:25.201 --> 00:28.391
We had a practice and we let them come in and watch some of our practice.

00:28.495 --> 00:30.050
Our warm-ups and some of the things we're doing.

00:30.191 --> 00:33.661
And we kind of opened up the court and let the kids come down on the court.

00:34.304 --> 00:36.457
They did what we would do in clinics,...

00:36.999 --> 00:39.404
...you know, dribbling, speed drill, and relay drill.

00:40.143 --> 00:43.511
You know, we enjoy seeing their smiles and in turn it makes us happy,...

00:43.945 --> 00:48.902
...so it's a good opportunity for us to bond with the kids.

00:53.681 --> 00:56.751
We're trying to give them great experiences and open their eyes...

00:56.895 --> 01:00.172
...because if you do that, those same kids will start dreaming...

01:00.277 --> 01:04.995
...that one day they could become a President Obama or a Kobe Bryant.

01:05.271 --> 01:08.352
President Obama accomplished something that many people thought was impossible,...

01:08.483 --> 01:11.503
...and to be able to shake his hand and look him in the eye is truly an inspiration.

01:15.481 --> 01:18.750
Now we got to turn our ears on and our mind...

01:18.940 --> 01:21.947
...because of the very important message that comes at the end of this, alright?

01:22.228 --> 01:25.155
I'm talking to you about doing good in school and getting good grades...

01:25.267 --> 01:28.407
...and doing all of those things, but you have to have the energy to do that.

01:29.007 --> 01:32.767
And the energy comes from eating right, getting your rest in the mornings,...

01:33.115 --> 01:36.290
...but also trying to have some fun like this at least once a day.

01:36.414 --> 01:39.955
We're just trying to make sure you understand though the importance of just being active.

01:40.628 --> 01:43.983
Especially in this day and age, I know childhood obesity is a big issue.

01:44.733 --> 01:48.369
I'm just trying to get kids fit and active and thinking about eating right...

01:48.474 --> 01:49.971
...and getting enough rest and doing the right thing.

01:50.093 --> 01:52.681
It's important so we have a little bit of time to do that today,...

01:52.839 --> 01:54.623
...and I think it worked out well for both sides.

01:55.819 --> 01:57.808
Lakers!
