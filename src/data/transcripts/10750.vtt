00:01.360 --> 00:04.330
May 29, 1953.

00:05.090 --> 00:08.265
Today is the most important day of my life.

00:08.530 --> 00:13.095
I finally climbed Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world.

00:13.495 --> 00:15.760
The top of the mountain was amazing.

00:16.090 --> 00:18.345
It felt like we were close to heaven.

00:19.060 --> 00:22.725
The snow was so thick that my boots sank.

00:23.055 --> 00:24.690
The air was silent.

00:25.190 --> 00:27.385
I looked at the beauty that surrounded me.

00:27.790 --> 00:30.785
Maybe my story will be a legend someday.

00:31.400 --> 00:34.085
I want people to remember this forever.

00:34.650 --> 00:40.420
I was the senior explorer in my group and I knew we needed proof of our climb.

00:41.085 --> 00:43.420
I took many pictures with my camera.

00:43.980 --> 00:45.955
I'll put them in a frame and hang them.

00:46.815 --> 00:49.850
On the mountain, the air was very cold.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.715
I wrapped my coat around my body.

00:53.315 --> 00:55.915
I looked over the side of the mountaintop.

00:56.600 --> 01:01.265
From that angle, I saw the border of the clouds touch the rocks below.

01:02.110 --> 01:03.696
The snow was thick.

01:03.870 --> 01:04.931
It looked pure.

01:05.245 --> 01:07.510
There was no sign of modern life.

01:08.210 --> 01:12.045
Thousands of years ago, my ancestors saw the world this way.

01:12.800 --> 01:17.440
After 15 minutes, I knew it was time to proceed down the mountain.

01:17.975 --> 01:20.170
The whole team congratulated us.

01:20.570 --> 01:23.570
My superior, John Hunt, praised us all.

01:24.005 --> 01:28.160
I sent messages to my relatives to tell them that I was safe.

01:28.700 --> 01:31.450
But it was hard to leave the mountain so quickly.

01:31.870 --> 01:35.165
I wanted to enjoy the incredible sight even longer.
