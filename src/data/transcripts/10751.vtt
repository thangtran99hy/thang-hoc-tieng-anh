You know, it's true.

00:02.450 --> 00:07.100
When something exceeds your ability to understand how it works,...

00:07.800 --> 00:09.450
...it, sort of, becomes magical.

00:10.100 --> 00:12.300
And that's exactly what the iPad is.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.900
It's hard to see how something so simple, so thin and so light...

00:21.400 --> 00:23.750
...could possibly be so capable.

00:25.200 --> 00:26.700
The iPhone was a revolution.

00:27.300 --> 00:28.650
And we learned so much from it.

00:29.200 --> 00:32.300
And developed so many amazing technologies, all the applications,...

00:32.350 --> 00:33.900
...the multi-touch user interface.

00:33.950 --> 00:36.150
It was truly an incredible breakthrough product.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.950
We wanted to take all of that...

00:39.300 --> 00:42.100
...and apply that to a whole new class of product.

00:42.750 --> 00:45.350
The iPad is the best web surfing experience.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.250
The best e-mail experience.

00:47.500 --> 00:50.650
The best photo and movie watching experience.

00:51.450 --> 00:55.000
It's gonna change the way we do the things we do every day.

00:55.850 --> 01:01.200
The face of the product is pretty much defined by a single piece of multi touch glass.

01:01.500 --> 01:02.400
And that's it.

01:03.150 --> 01:04.550
There's no pointing device.

01:04.650 --> 01:06.450
There isn't even a single orientation.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.000
And there's no up, there's no down.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.100
There's no right or wrong way of holding it.

01:10.650 --> 01:15.100
I don't have to change myself to fit the product, it fits me.
