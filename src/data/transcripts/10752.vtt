00:03.710 --> 00:05.829
It was the worst morning ever.

00:06.404 --> 00:12.209
When Carl woke up, he realized that he didn't do his astronomy and chemistry homework.

00:12.877 --> 00:18.164
Also, the forecast called for rain and that would affect baseball practice.

00:18.804 --> 00:22.895
Suddenly, his mother yelled, "Take out the garbage right now!"

00:23.755 --> 00:28.349
When Carl returned from taking the garbage outside, he was all wet.

00:28.877 --> 00:30.851
"What a terrible day!", he said.

00:31.555 --> 00:32.782
He walked to class.

00:33.332 --> 00:37.350
He put his umbrella on the shelf and sat in the third row.

00:37.919 --> 00:41.493
But the teacher asked why Carl's umbrella was on the floor.

00:41.993 --> 00:46.924
He told her not to blame him, but she sent him to the principal out of spite.

00:47.773 --> 00:50.298
Next, he took a geography test.

00:50.795 --> 00:53.844
Despite studying, Carl didn't know the answers.

00:54.467 --> 00:56.893
He started drawing lightly on his paper.

00:57.577 --> 00:59.681
Carl drew a huge dinosaur.

01:00.245 --> 01:01.627
What if it were real?

01:02.119 --> 01:03.745
He saw it in his mind.

01:04.499 --> 01:08.225
Carl's class said he was a genius for having a dinosaur.

01:08.860 --> 01:11.176
It could interfere with math class too!

01:11.981 --> 01:15.139
Soon, Carl's fame spread through school.

01:15.990 --> 01:20.441
He taught his dinosaur to be very gentle and put it on exhibit.

01:21.163 --> 01:25.879
But admission would only be given to those classmates who paid him a fee.

01:26.505 --> 01:28.088
His idea was super.

01:29.015 --> 01:32.073
"It's time to turn in your tests.", the teacher said.

01:32.746 --> 01:34.283
Carl looked at his paper.

01:34.835 --> 01:38.651
As he was dreaming in class, he hadn't finished the test!
