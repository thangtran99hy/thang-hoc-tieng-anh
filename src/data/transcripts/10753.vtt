I have a story about following dreams...

00:04.450 --> 00:05.950
...or maybe more accurately...

00:06.450 --> 00:09.776
...it's a story about finding a path to make those dreams real.

00:11.498 --> 00:14.339
Do you know what it is like to wake up in the middle of the night with a vivid dream?

00:14.783 --> 00:17.222
And you know how if you don't have a pencil and pad by the bed...

00:17.723 --> 00:20.220
...it will be completely gone by the next morning?

00:22.468 --> 00:24.691
I had one of those dreams when I was 23.

00:25.409 --> 00:27.160
When I suddenly woke up, I was thinking,...

00:27.624 --> 00:30.991
...what if we could download the whole Web and just keep the links?

00:31.169 --> 00:33.233
And I grabbed a pen and started writing.

00:34.210 --> 00:37.337
Sometimes, it's important to wake up and stop dreaming.

00:38.572 --> 00:41.394
I spent the middle of that night scribbling out the details...

00:41.513 --> 00:43.510
...and convincing myself it would work.

00:44.431 --> 00:47.947
Soon after, I told my advisor, Terry Winograd,...

00:48.350 --> 00:50.817
...it would take a couple of weeks for me to download the Web.

00:52.409 --> 00:53.853
He nodded knowingly,...

00:54.092 --> 00:58.207
...fully aware it would take much longer but wise enough not to tell me.

00:59.846 --> 01:02.095
The optimism of youth is often underrated.

01:03.043 --> 01:06.733
Amazingly at that time, I had no thoughts of building a search engine.

01:07.168 --> 01:08.735
The idea wasn't even on the radar.

01:09.872 --> 01:12.705
But much later, we happened upon a better way of ranking...

01:13.350 --> 01:16.350
...and we made a really great search engine, and Google was born.

01:17.627 --> 01:20.264
When a really great dream shows up, grab it!
