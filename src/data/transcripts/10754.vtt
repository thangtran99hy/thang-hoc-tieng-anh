Mary Jane Willard is a breast cancer survivor.

00:04.550 --> 00:09.100
She has a new lease on life and a new way of expressing herself.

00:09.850 --> 00:12.500
It relaxes you, it relaxes me.

00:14.200 --> 00:18.700
I've learned a lot of different things with the art,...

00:19.350 --> 00:21.150
...with Chinese ink art,...

00:21.650 --> 00:23.450
...and I've made a lot of friends.

00:23.500 --> 00:28.350
She's learning Chinese ink art through M.D. Anderson's COLLAGE program,...

00:28.450 --> 00:31.300
...also known as the Art for Cancer Network.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.800
The class is taught by Peihong Dong Endris,...

00:35.050 --> 00:38.000
...an artist who learned the technique growing up in China.

00:41.250 --> 00:46.600
Endris says the class helps patients forget about their daily struggle with disease...

00:46.800 --> 00:49.350
...and find comfort in their creativity.

00:49.750 --> 00:56.300
I think from this class, even for some people with a difficult time,...

00:56.350 --> 00:58.650
...they can get a short time of peace.

00:58.950 --> 01:02.200
The students say they love this art form and their teacher.

01:02.450 --> 01:03.250
She's very good.

01:03.700 --> 01:11.050
She helps you step by step when she comes, and with each person she demonstrates it with you too.

01:11.100 --> 01:12.500
She gives you that opportunity.

01:13.150 --> 01:18.750
Studies have shown that improvements in mood and outlook can help a patient fight disease.

01:18.950 --> 01:22.950
And although no scientific studies have been carried out on this program,...

01:23.150 --> 01:25.750
...Dr. Wheler says she thinks it helps.

01:25.850 --> 01:28.300
It can't hurt, it can only help,...

01:28.350 --> 01:34.350
...and scientists are trying to be a little bit more rigorous about quantifying the effect.
