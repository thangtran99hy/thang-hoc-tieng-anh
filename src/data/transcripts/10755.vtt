A long time ago in Alaska, a dog named Patsy Ann watched the horizon.

00:08.870 --> 00:12.910
Every day she waited by the bay for ships returning from an expedition.

00:13.580 --> 00:16.715
Patsy Ann was a brilliant dog and she was very unique.

00:16.980 --> 00:17.882
She was deaf.

00:18.146 --> 00:22.340
She couldn't bark either, but she used all of her other senses...

00:22.367 --> 00:23.990
...to know when a ship was near.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.425
Patsy Ann lived on the streets.

00:26.720 --> 00:29.562
Her owners did not want her because she could not hear,...

00:29.803 --> 00:30.967
...so they abandoned her.

00:31.460 --> 00:33.735
She found refuge in a fancy hotel.

00:34.235 --> 00:36.905
Guests rubbed her back and scratched her chin.

00:37.270 --> 00:38.905
Many people gave her food.

00:39.130 --> 00:40.805
She became quite overweight.

00:41.270 --> 00:42.710
She became very famous.

00:43.075 --> 00:46.325
Visitors to Alaska were enthusiastic about meeting her.

00:46.715 --> 00:48.250
They brought presents for her.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.915
They liked seeing her and the feeling was mutual.

00:51.250 --> 00:54.885
The mayor said, "Patsy Ann should be called the town's greeter."

00:55.080 --> 00:59.595
The people in town loved Patsy Ann too, even though she lived on the streets.

01:00.025 --> 01:01.895
They were willing to fight to keep her.

01:02.295 --> 01:05.935
A new law made all dogs wear a collar and get shots.

01:06.330 --> 01:08.315
The mayor received many complaints.

01:08.805 --> 01:11.570
People wanted Patsy Ann to be able to stay.

01:12.100 --> 01:14.625
One ambitious sailor got people to help.

01:14.970 --> 01:18.565
Together, they paid for Patsy Ann to go to the veterinarian.

01:19.045 --> 01:20.824
She got her shots and collar.

01:21.084 --> 01:21.981
She could stay.

01:22.650 --> 01:26.635
When Patsy Ann died, everyone missed the town's loyal greeter.

01:26.985 --> 01:30.690
So the mayor hired someone to make a statue of Patsy Ann.

01:30.955 --> 01:32.830
He restored the town's greeter.

01:33.050 --> 01:37.030
Now she sits at the dock forever, waiting for ships to come home.
