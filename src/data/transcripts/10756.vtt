I took this shot in front of a wedding dress shop...

00:03.735 --> 00:06.440
...which building they're obviously renovating.

00:07.140 --> 00:12.780
I found it funny to think of the plastic tarpaulin as an extension of the dress.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.715
I know, it's silly.

00:15.380 --> 00:16.785
For your information,...

00:17.250 --> 00:21.555
...there is a little less than 300,000 marriages per year in France,...

00:22.155 --> 00:24.725
...and about 150,000 divorces.

00:25.090 --> 00:31.230
The average age of the groom is 31 and the one of the bride is 29.
