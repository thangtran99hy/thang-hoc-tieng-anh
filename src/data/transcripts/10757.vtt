00:00.660 --> 00:04.950
And the number one question that came from a concerned Conservative in Georgia,...

00:05.000 --> 00:06.900
...who asked about your plans for the War on Terror.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.300
And then, Sean from Pennsylvania followed it up with:...

00:10.250 --> 00:13.300
...Dear President Obama, if we remove our troops from the War on Terror,...

00:13.350 --> 00:15.700
...how will you continue to combat the threat of terrorism?

00:16.600 --> 00:19.950
Well first of all, I think it's important to understand...

00:20.000 --> 00:23.950
...that we are at war against a very specific group.

00:24.200 --> 00:28.550
Al-Qaeda and its extremist allies that have metastasized around the globe...

00:28.900 --> 00:32.700
...that would attack us, attack our allies,...

00:33.050 --> 00:36.700
...attack bases and embassies around the world,...

00:36.950 --> 00:40.750
...and then most sadly, attack innocent people,...

00:41.300 --> 00:44.750
...regardless of their backgrounds, regardless of their religions.

00:45.850 --> 00:54.450
The al-Qaeda is probably the biggest killer of innocent Muslims of any entity out there.

00:54.900 --> 00:58.500
And so, that is our target, and that is our focus.

00:58.550 --> 01:00.300
Now, they employ terrorist tactics...

01:01.200 --> 01:04.700
...but we need to be clear about who our target is.

01:05.750 --> 01:08.250
And we have to fight them on all fronts.

01:08.400 --> 01:14.100
We have to fight them in very concrete ways in Afghanistan...

01:14.150 --> 01:18.050
...and along the border regions of Pakistan where they are still holed up.

01:19.150 --> 01:22.100
They have spread to places like Yemen and Somalia,...

01:22.150 --> 01:25.750
...and we are working internationally with partners...

01:25.950 --> 01:31.600
...to try to limit their scope of operations, and dismantle them in those regions.

01:32.700 --> 01:35.150
But we also have to battle them with ideas.

01:35.450 --> 01:40.800
And we have to help work with the overwhelming majority of Muslims...

01:40.850 --> 01:43.500
...who reject senseless violence of this sort...

01:44.250 --> 01:48.650
...and to work to provide different pathways and different alternatives...

01:48.700 --> 01:55.600
...for people expressing whatever policy differences that they may have.

01:55.800 --> 01:58.450
And I think we haven't done as good of a job on that front.

01:59.100 --> 02:05.150
We have to project economically, working in countries like Yemen, that is extraordinarily poor...

02:05.200 --> 02:07.950
...to make sure that young people there have opportunities.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.800
The same is true in a place like Pakistan.
