00:03.994 --> 00:08.233
Dalton was a nice boy but sometimes the other boys made fun of him...

00:08.421 --> 00:10.105
...because he was so tall and skinny.

00:10.899 --> 00:12.940
Dalton's biggest problem was Mitch.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.658
He was a bully who boasted about his strength.

00:16.100 --> 00:17.804
He quarreled with the other boys.

00:18.227 --> 00:21.180
Sometimes, if boys gave Mitch their lunch money,...

00:21.516 --> 00:23.439
...he would have mercy and leave them alone.

00:23.969 --> 00:27.973
One day, the boys learned about a special Middle School Olympics.

00:28.365 --> 00:30.311
Their gym class was going to be in it.

00:30.842 --> 00:34.937
Many kids were excited, but Dalton thought it sounded like torture.

00:35.641 --> 00:39.545
That morning, Dalton ate plenty of carbohydrates for breakfast.

00:39.953 --> 00:42.677
He entered the gym and looked at the dial on the clock.

00:43.151 --> 00:44.299
It was time to begin.

00:44.881 --> 00:46.523
The teacher asked if they were ready.

00:46.895 --> 00:49.029
Everyone nodded except Dalton.

00:49.997 --> 00:53.576
"I got stung by a bee. I need to see the nurse," said Dalton.

00:54.042 --> 00:56.063
He made it up so he wouldn't have to play.

00:56.667 --> 01:00.449
"I don't believe you. Get ready to play," responded the coach.

01:00.975 --> 01:02.119
First, they wrestled.

01:02.409 --> 01:04.991
Then they jumped, crawled and played other games.

01:05.364 --> 01:07.591
But Mitch was dominant in every event.

01:08.079 --> 01:09.976
They strained all morning to defeat him.

01:10.295 --> 01:11.528
By lunch, they were sore.

01:11.923 --> 01:13.893
Their entire bodies ailed them.

01:14.211 --> 01:15.543
They thought about how to win.

01:16.087 --> 01:18.634
They knew the last game of the day was volleyball.

01:19.282 --> 01:22.582
Kids who used to be Dalton's rivals became his allies.

01:22.978 --> 01:25.163
They wanted him to help them beat Mitch.

01:25.771 --> 01:27.779
Dalton was going to be Mitch's opponent.

01:28.087 --> 01:29.195
The game started.

01:29.717 --> 01:33.648
Every time Mitch tried to hit the ball over the net, Dalton stopped it.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.199
Finally, Mitch used all of his strength,...

01:36.583 --> 01:38.655
...but the ball bounced off Dalton's hands...

01:38.783 --> 01:40.317
...and back into Mitch's face!

01:40.823 --> 01:42.363
Finally, Mitch was defeated.
