Let's work to change the political system, as imperfect as it is.

00:05.650 --> 00:10.550
I know people can feel down about the way things are going sometimes here in Washington.

00:11.300 --> 00:13.700
I know it's tempting to give up on the political process.

00:13.750 --> 00:18.850
But we've put in place tougher rules on lobbying and ethics, and transparency.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.050
Tougher rules than any administration in history.

00:22.150 --> 00:24.350
It's not enough but it's progress.

00:24.500 --> 00:25.700
Progress is possible.

00:26.050 --> 00:27.250
Don't give up on voting.

00:27.450 --> 00:29.050
Don't give up on advocacy.

00:29.850 --> 00:31.250
Don't give up on activism.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.200
There are too many needs to be met,...

00:34.200 --> 00:35.400
...too much work to be done.

00:36.350 --> 00:41.850
Like Dr. King said, "We must accept finite disappointment...

00:42.750 --> 00:44.300
...but never lose infinite hope."
