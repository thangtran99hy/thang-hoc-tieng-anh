00:03.700 --> 00:08.150
A lovely princess sat by the pool and played with a sculpture of a bear.

00:08.720 --> 00:12.045
Suddenly, she dropped it and it rolled away.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.415
She chased it but it fell into the water.

00:16.230 --> 00:17.550
She began to cry.

00:18.350 --> 00:22.215
A large, ugly frog asked, "Why are you crying?"

00:22.920 --> 00:27.260
After the princess told him, the frog said, "I can get the sculpture."

00:27.990 --> 00:30.795
"What will you give me in exchange for the favor?"

00:31.165 --> 00:34.135
"I can pay you a fee in gold.", she said.

00:35.070 --> 00:36.435
But the frog protested.

00:36.735 --> 00:40.670
"I want to sleep in your bed and you must kiss me in the morning."

00:41.640 --> 00:46.575
He'd die without water, so I don't have to keep my promise, she thought.

00:47.345 --> 00:50.515
The frog dove for a brief moment and got the sculpture.

00:51.450 --> 00:53.165
Then, the princess ran away with it.

00:53.820 --> 00:56.325
Later, the frog went to the palace.

00:57.290 --> 00:59.325
The king told her to keep her promise.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.395
This put the princess in a bad mood.

01:03.430 --> 01:05.695
She permitted the frog to sleep on her pillow.

01:06.660 --> 01:08.835
In the morning, she gave him a kiss.

01:09.770 --> 01:12.105
Suddenly, he turned into a guy.

01:12.805 --> 01:15.800
He said, "I'm from a kingdom abroad."

01:16.640 --> 01:22.115
"In my youth, I angered a tribe of cruel witches, who turned me into a frog."

01:22.650 --> 01:27.125
The princess asked him, "Can I be your bride and stay with you forever?"

01:28.025 --> 01:31.625
But the prince said, "No. You disappointed me."

01:32.125 --> 01:33.705
"You didn't keep your promise."
