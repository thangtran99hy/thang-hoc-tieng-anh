00:03.905 --> 00:07.540
Once, there was a chef, who was mean to his cooks.

00:08.170 --> 00:10.745
He was mean to the people who came in to eat.

00:11.245 --> 00:13.020
He charged too much for meals.

00:13.745 --> 00:17.150
Many people were not able to afford the cheapest bean dish.

00:17.580 --> 00:20.955
When his metal oven broke, he did not have it fixed.

00:21.620 --> 00:23.490
So everything baked in it burned.

00:24.290 --> 00:28.365
The only light was from candles and the whole place was a mess.

00:28.760 --> 00:31.295
Sometimes, he didn't pay his waiters.

00:31.930 --> 00:35.035
Since they had no funds, they had many debts.

00:35.465 --> 00:37.505
The chef behaved this way all the time.

00:38.205 --> 00:41.840
He monitored the cooks and yelled if they did not do things his way.

00:43.010 --> 00:46.680
One day, the cooks decided that they were tired of the abuse...

00:47.110 --> 00:49.150
...and that they would not be passive anymore.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.785
Everyone opposed the chef.

00:52.715 --> 00:55.125
At first, they thought about suing him.

00:55.920 --> 00:58.425
Instead, they tied up the chef with rope.

00:59.090 --> 01:00.925
Now, they controlled the restaurant!

01:01.825 --> 01:03.665
They decreased the price of food.

01:04.430 --> 01:07.700
They used the best ingredients and made large quantities of food.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.713
They turned on the lights.

01:10.575 --> 01:13.219
The restaurant was converted into a happy place.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.800
For the first time, many people came to eat.

01:17.775 --> 01:20.980
The chef realized that the restaurant's problems were his fault.

01:21.950 --> 01:23.785
The chef learned an important lesson.

01:24.750 --> 01:28.955
The new, generous chef insisted on giving the customers a free meal.
