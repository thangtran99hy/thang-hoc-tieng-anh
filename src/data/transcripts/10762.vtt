00:02.050 --> 00:05.750
Ford Motor Company President and CEO Alan Mulally...

00:05.900 --> 00:09.300
...set the tone for the 2010 Washington auto show.

00:09.750 --> 00:13.200
I'm Alan. I'm from Ford, and I'm ready to take care of your car needs.

00:13.500 --> 00:17.200
Mulally announced a $400 million investment...

00:17.250 --> 00:22.700
...that he said would make Ford's next generation Explorer 25% more fuel efficient.

00:22.900 --> 00:26.900
Because of our size and our scale, when we make that kind of fuel efficiency,...

00:27.100 --> 00:29.300
...and we put it in across the entire product line,...

00:29.600 --> 00:34.450
...we make a significant improvement in fuel mileage and CO2 reduction.

00:35.200 --> 00:39.350
Ford is coming off its first profitable year since 2005.

00:39.600 --> 00:45.600
The company expects hybrids and electric vehicles to make up 20% of its fleet by 2020,...

00:45.900 --> 00:47.600
...up from 3% today.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.500
That interests Cynthia Smith from Potomac, Maryland.

00:51.650 --> 00:55.750
I would like to support some sort of alternate energy option.

00:56.500 --> 01:00.000
But she's not convinced that she would buy the much anticipated Chevy Volt,...

01:00.150 --> 01:03.700
...a General Motors electric car that runs 64 kilometers...

01:03.750 --> 01:07.550
...before a gas powered generator kicks in to extend the range.

01:07.700 --> 01:08.950
If I'm gonna take a long trip,...

01:09.000 --> 01:13.200
...I just plain would not buy a car where I was 100% limited...

01:13.250 --> 01:15.675
...to an infrastructure that isn't there yet.

01:15.725 --> 01:17.750
I'm not ready to make that kind of a leap.
