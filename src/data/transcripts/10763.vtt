One country that has a very distinctive way of doing business,...

00:03.898 --> 00:06.683
...as we've known for quite some time, is Japan.

00:07.800 --> 00:11.183
Japan has both distinctive corporations,...

00:11.288 --> 00:15.250
...and a distinctive relationship between its corporations and its government.

00:16.233 --> 00:19.250
And some people have argued that as a result of globalization,...

00:19.357 --> 00:23.250
...that distinctive Japanese way of doing things is gradually disappearing.

00:23.967 --> 00:25.650
And I wanted to study that question.

00:25.833 --> 00:30.303
But it's a very broad question so I needed a handhold,...

00:30.367 --> 00:33.583
...someplace to really look to make sense of this.

00:34.033 --> 00:38.517
And my place to look was at the HR function inside corporations.

00:39.233 --> 00:44.517
Now that may seem like an esoteric way of studying globalization and convergence.

00:44.900 --> 00:51.117
But actually when you study senior executives, you get to learn a lot about corporations.

00:51.433 --> 00:54.050
And by studying the role of HR executives,...

00:54.133 --> 00:58.217
...I was able to learn a lot about similarities as well as differences...

00:58.633 --> 01:01.450
...in Japanese and American corporations.

01:02.200 --> 01:06.183
In Japan, historically, the senior HR executive...

01:06.633 --> 01:10.370
...was regarded as a very powerful person in the managerial hierarchy,...

01:10.433 --> 01:15.217
...and the HR function was regarded as a very prestigious and influential function...

01:15.300 --> 01:17.650
...at the highest levels inside the corporation.

01:18.300 --> 01:20.650
The same was not true in the United States.

01:21.067 --> 01:25.983
HR was regarded as low man or sometimes low woman on the totem pole...

01:26.933 --> 01:31.250
...and was not seen as a particularly influential or prestigious posting.

01:32.100 --> 01:38.117
And that, in turn, was related to other differences in Japanese and US corporations:...

01:38.200 --> 01:40.250
...to do with their employment practices,...

01:40.767 --> 01:45.983
...their way of valuing human assets, and their corporate governance practices.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.583
So the question I set out to study was,...

01:48.653 --> 01:51.983
...do these differences between Japan and the United States,...

01:52.083 --> 01:55.850
...with respect to their HR functions, continue to persist?

01:57.333 --> 02:01.717
And what does that tell us about globalization and convergence in the modern business era?
