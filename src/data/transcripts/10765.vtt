00:03.700 --> 00:07.440
Since her parents got a divorce, Anna has had to help her mother.

00:07.770 --> 00:11.410
In her mother's absence, Anna takes care of Grace, the baby.

00:11.710 --> 00:14.310
At first, Anna thought it was an easy job.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.950
One afternoon, Anna played with Grace.

00:17.350 --> 00:20.285
She meowed like a cat and Grace imitated her.

00:20.585 --> 00:24.455
In fact, Grace reproduced every sound that Anna made.

00:24.925 --> 00:26.525
She took her sister outside.

00:26.725 --> 00:30.390
She put Grace in the wagon, but there was nowhere for them to go.

00:30.590 --> 00:32.265
So they went back inside.

00:32.695 --> 00:35.935
Anna put the infant on the floor and went into her room.

00:36.270 --> 00:39.105
But when she came back, Grace had vanished!

00:39.500 --> 00:42.575
Anna looked everywhere, but she could not find her sister.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.868
Maybe the baby had been kidnapped!

00:45.354 --> 00:47.634
"Where are you?" Anna called aloud.

00:48.150 --> 00:50.150
The situation was becoming urgent.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.650
She wanted to call her mom,...

00:51.885 --> 00:54.720
...but she didn't want her to think Anna couldn't do the job.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.109
Anna sat down.

00:56.449 --> 00:57.757
What was she going to do?

00:58.155 --> 01:00.125
But then, Anna heard something.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.760
It was coming from her room.

01:02.165 --> 01:06.130
"Grace?" She got down on her knees and looked under the bed.

01:06.465 --> 01:08.335
She could see Grace's bald head.

01:08.735 --> 01:12.305
Grace had followed Anna into her room and crept under the bed.

01:12.970 --> 01:15.160
"What a relief!" Anna cried.

01:15.600 --> 01:18.245
She picked up her sister and patted her on the head.

01:18.645 --> 01:20.910
Her head was soft and had no wrinkles.

01:21.415 --> 01:24.215
Grace was sucking on a thumb and looked tired.

01:24.485 --> 01:27.985
So Anna wrapped her in a blanket and sang rhymes for her.

01:28.455 --> 01:30.790
Then she put Grace in bed for a nap.

01:31.320 --> 01:36.470
After that afternoon, Anna knew that taking care of Grace was not an easy job.

01:36.730 --> 01:39.165
It takes a lot of work to take care of a baby!
