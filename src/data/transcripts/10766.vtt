00:00.750 --> 00:03.200
Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:03.600 --> 00:06.550
This program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:07.550 --> 00:08.700
Today's Maestro Hook:...

00:09.600 --> 00:12.100
...Today, I'd like to talk a little bit about this program,...

00:12.200 --> 00:14.100
...AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:14.400 --> 00:17.700
And explain to you how you can use it the best to make your English better.

00:18.500 --> 00:22.800
First the title, Native Maestro doesn't mean I'm a native maestro.

00:23.250 --> 00:24.400
I'm just a maÃ®tre d'.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.750
I'm gonna help you become the native maestro by using this program.

00:30.450 --> 00:34.200
In AERA English TV, there are the Native Maestro contents...

00:34.350 --> 00:37.300
...and if you click on the contents, you'll hear me speaking.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.950
And it's divided into three parts.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.250
First is the Maestro Hook.

00:42.750 --> 00:47.750
A Hook is a good conversation beginner that you can use to do a good conversation.

00:48.750 --> 00:51.150
So, practice this phrase that I'm telling you.

00:51.450 --> 00:53.000
And you can use it with a foreigner.

00:53.300 --> 00:56.050
And you can use it to make a conversation more exciting.

00:56.450 --> 01:00.100
There are a lot of topics about the difference between the Japanese and Westerners.

01:01.300 --> 01:04.050
Second is the Maestro Menu.

01:04.450 --> 01:08.650
In the Maestro Menu, we have some words, very simple, simple words...

01:08.850 --> 01:11.250
...that you can use in a normal conversation...

01:11.500 --> 01:13.300
...and you'll be more like a native maestro.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.650
And last, the Maestro Line.

01:17.300 --> 01:20.700
The Maestro Line is using the words in the Maestro Menu...

01:20.900 --> 01:23.400
...and actually, you can see how a conversation is made...

01:24.000 --> 01:26.250
...so you can practice all three parts differently,...

01:26.550 --> 01:28.600
...and you're closer to a native maestro.

01:29.350 --> 01:31.000
Okay, so let's start.

01:31.950 --> 01:34.400
This Maestro Menu is really simple.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.250
The first word is just because.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.250
Oh, just because.

02:05.000 --> 02:05.850
I felt like it.

02:06.850 --> 02:07.550
I felt like it.

02:16.300 --> 02:18.000
Oh, I felt like it.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.600
Okay, Maestro Lines.

02:35.500 --> 02:38.200
So Seita, why are you wearing blue today?

02:38.550 --> 02:40.650
Oh, you know, I just felt like it.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.100
Why are you eating Chinese food today?

02:45.750 --> 02:47.300
Oh, just because...

02:49.950 --> 02:54.700
So, practice these three parts and you can become closer to a native maestro.

02:55.500 --> 02:56.750
Alright, that's it for today...

02:56.950 --> 02:59.500
...and see you next week in a different Native Maestro show.

03:00.300 --> 03:00.900
See you later!
