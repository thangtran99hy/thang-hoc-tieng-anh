Okay, welcome to Michael's Business Top Tips.

00:05.350 --> 00:08.800
This month, we're looking at positive problem solving.

00:09.750 --> 00:15.000
Now, a big part of life and especially business life is dealing with problems.

00:15.450 --> 00:18.200
This can be difficult but don't worry.

00:18.600 --> 00:23.300
Today, I'm going to introduce three positive problem solving approaches.

00:24.350 --> 00:26.850
First one: positive speaking.

00:27.750 --> 00:31.150
Now, positive speaking is very simple but very powerful.

00:31.950 --> 00:35.200
Instead of using negative thinking and language,...

00:35.500 --> 00:38.650
...use positive speaking to add positive energy.

00:39.350 --> 00:44.750
For example, make a list of your problems using the most negative language.

00:45.400 --> 00:49.800
Then, on the other side, write a column, opportunities.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.450
Rewrite each problem into an opportunity.

00:55.300 --> 00:57.650
Second: solution path.

00:58.500 --> 01:02.000
Again, this gets away from a negative approach to problem solving.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.300
Identify where do you want to be,...

01:05.650 --> 01:07.500
...we call the ideal situation.

01:08.200 --> 01:11.500
Then, what is the actual situation now.

01:12.300 --> 01:17.250
Then, design a path to take you from the actual to the ideal.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.000
Then, you're not solving problems...

01:20.150 --> 01:23.300
...but you're moving along your path to the ultimate solution.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.550
Third: appreciative inquiry.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.850
This is a really positive approach.

01:30.600 --> 01:33.800
Instead of focusing on what's not working in your company,...

01:34.150 --> 01:36.300
...look at what is working well.

01:36.500 --> 01:39.100
The good points, the strengths and the positives.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.550
Discover what is working well within your team or company, or product.

01:44.250 --> 01:47.250
Then, dream how can you make it even better.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.250
Similar to that ideal situation.

01:50.300 --> 01:53.600
Third step: design a plan to take you there...

01:53.900 --> 01:57.850
...using the strong points your team or company has.

01:58.750 --> 02:00.250
And finally, deliver.

02:00.700 --> 02:02.750
Introduce that as an action plan.

02:04.300 --> 02:09.750
So, here are three techniques to help you turn problems into opportunities.

02:10.350 --> 02:11.050
Good luck!
