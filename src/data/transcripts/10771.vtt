00:01.400 --> 00:03.305
In the quest to be clever,...

00:04.000 --> 00:10.475
...I completely forgot about the people that I love and the people that love me.

00:11.910 --> 00:12.645
And I went,...

00:14.510 --> 00:21.420
...as I had begun to do into a wormhole of selfishness...

00:23.020 --> 00:28.825
...and greediness and arrogance, in thinking that if I just continue to be...

00:29.625 --> 00:36.135
...speedy and witty and pull together as many fast words and phrases that I could,...

00:36.630 --> 00:39.740
...that I could be clever enough to buy myself another day,...

00:40.570 --> 00:45.110
...without thinking that anybody would find me, pin me down, and say, "You're a creep!"

00:45.380 --> 00:51.635
And when I should have just given that up and played the guitar a little bit more,...

00:53.360 --> 00:59.360
...I didn't. So I decided that I would try to be as clever as possible all the time.

01:00.860 --> 01:04.030
And I did that at the expense of people that I love.

01:04.695 --> 01:07.465
And that feels absolutely terrible.

01:07.900 --> 01:11.135
It feels worse than any headline I thought I could get my way out of.

01:11.470 --> 01:17.145
I think it's important that you know that everybody on the stage...

01:17.510 --> 01:19.880
...is here playing with me not because they condone...

01:20.710 --> 01:26.120
...what I say in any given interview and certainly not in the interview that's made the rounds today.

01:26.385 --> 01:29.320
They're not on the stage because they support what I said.

01:29.555 --> 01:35.160
They're on the stage because they support myself as a possible future grown up.
