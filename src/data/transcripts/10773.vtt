00:01.350 --> 00:03.650
Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:04.150 --> 00:05.330
I am your maitre d' Seita.

00:05.800 --> 00:09.100
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:10.150 --> 00:13.350
Okay, today's Maestro Hook:...

00:13.850 --> 00:16.300
...The Maestro Hook is a simple conversation hook...

00:16.400 --> 00:19.350
...that you can use with people to get a good conversation going.

00:19.650 --> 00:21.550
And today is about barhopping.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.500
Japanese people like to go barhopping...

00:24.750 --> 00:27.100
...and they drink in a lot of different places like...

00:29.800 --> 00:33.550
But in the West, most people like to drink in one place.

00:33.650 --> 00:37.150
They stay in one place and they don't go to different bars so much.

00:38.100 --> 00:42.300
But in Japan, we call that barhopping, so please remember this word.

00:47.100 --> 00:49.500
Okay, today's Maestro Menu:...

01:01.800 --> 01:02.950
I'll have what she's having.

01:04.150 --> 01:05.500
I'll have what she's having.

01:14.100 --> 01:15.100
I'll have what she's having.

01:18.650 --> 01:20.250
So, please practice.

01:23.950 --> 01:24.950
What's on tap?

01:25.700 --> 01:26.650
What's on tap?

01:33.050 --> 01:33.900
What's on tap?

01:38.450 --> 01:40.400
So, please practice.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.750
Okay, Maestro Lines.

01:47.200 --> 01:47.950
"What are you gonna have?"

01:48.800 --> 01:51.150
"Oh, I'll have a bottle of beer."

01:51.800 --> 01:53.800
"Okay, I'll have what she's having."

01:56.700 --> 01:57.500
"What's on tap?"

01:58.050 --> 02:00.650
"Oh, we have Miller, Coors, Bud and Bud Light."

02:01.050 --> 02:02.300
"Okay, I'll take a Bud."

02:03.050 --> 02:03.900
"Okay, thanks."

02:08.500 --> 02:10.450
Okay, that's it for today.

02:10.800 --> 02:14.250
And there'll be more conversation pieces that you can practice next week, so...

02:14.450 --> 02:17.300
...tune in to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

02:17.750 --> 02:19.250
Alright, see you later!
