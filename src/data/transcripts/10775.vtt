00:01.850 --> 00:03.750
Well, my first question is,...

00:03.850 --> 00:08.500
...what was the biggest challenge to make this very new, you know,...

00:08.800 --> 00:09.750
New music.

00:10.800 --> 00:16.100
I think the biggest challenge was to make the transition,...

00:16.350 --> 00:18.550
...of course, from being a classical musician...

00:18.800 --> 00:21.050
...to doing something completely different...

00:21.350 --> 00:26.900
...and forgetting all of the rules that you were told when you were a classical musician.

00:27.150 --> 00:32.100
So, you have to forget everything you've studied, and your way of playing,...

00:32.150 --> 00:33.350
...your way of thinking.

00:33.400 --> 00:37.450
And you have to, kind of, go back to the beginning, and start again.

00:37.500 --> 00:40.750
You have to learn to be very free...

00:40.900 --> 00:42.900
...and you have to learn how to improvise.

00:42.950 --> 00:44.700
And then, I started writing music.

00:44.750 --> 00:49.300
So, it was quite a long journey, and it was very challenging.

00:49.350 --> 00:54.500
But the more challenging it became, the more I was determined to achieve this album,...

00:54.550 --> 00:56.050
...and make this kind of music.

00:56.900 --> 01:00.500
So, how long have you spent to make this?

01:00.700 --> 01:05.900
Well, it's difficult to say because, of course, my last album was eight years ago,...

01:05.950 --> 01:08.000
...which is a very long time.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.750
And I think through all of that process,...

01:12.600 --> 01:17.150
...of course, I was trying then to change my style of playing and learn new things.

01:17.400 --> 01:21.200
So, I think the whole time was, you know, the transitional period.

01:21.250 --> 01:24.150
And if certain things hadn't happened during that time,...

01:24.350 --> 01:27.100
...I don't think this album would have been made in the same way.

01:27.300 --> 01:28.800
And if I'd made it earlier,...

01:29.200 --> 01:33.900
...you know, maybe I wouldn't have known exactly the message I wanted to give as a musician.

01:33.950 --> 01:36.100
So, I think it really happened at the right time.
