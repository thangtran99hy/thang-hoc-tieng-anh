The first thing we all do when we find something interesting is share it.

00:03.900 --> 00:06.010
More and more, this kind of sharing takes place online.

00:06.740 --> 00:10.155
Google Buzz is a new way to share updates, photos, videos and more,...

00:10.570 --> 00:12.875
...and start conversations about the things you find interesting.

00:13.750 --> 00:17.120
It's built right into Gmail and uses the friends you've already made...

00:17.450 --> 00:18.485
...so there's nothing to set up.

00:19.015 --> 00:21.755
You're automatically following the people you email and chat with the most.

00:22.950 --> 00:24.695
You can choose to share publicly with the world...

00:26.225 --> 00:28.395
...or privately to a small group of your closest friends.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.195
Buzz goes beyond status messages.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.600
It automatically pulls images from links,...

00:35.970 --> 00:37.135
...plays videos inline,...

00:40.740 --> 00:43.045
...and lets you flip through photos the way they were meant to be seen,...

00:43.810 --> 00:44.775
...big and fast.

00:46.145 --> 00:47.645
You can connect to other sites you use,...

00:48.110 --> 00:50.785
...like Picasa, Flickr, Google Reader, and Twitter...

00:51.215 --> 00:53.250
...so your friends can keep up with what you're doing around the Web,...

00:53.550 --> 00:54.575
...all in one place.

00:55.755 --> 00:57.855
Buzz makes sure you see the stuff that matters most.

00:58.345 --> 01:00.895
The best part about sharing is getting responses to your posts.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.930
Buzz sends these comments to your inbox to make sure you don't miss them.

01:05.665 --> 01:07.955
You can respond right from there to keep the conversation going.

01:10.205 --> 01:12.050
If you want to make sure your friend sees something,...

01:12.905 --> 01:15.410
...you can send it straight to their inbox by adding them with an @reply.

01:18.615 --> 01:21.680
You'll sometimes see recommended Buzz from people you're not directly following.

01:22.080 --> 01:25.300
Buzz identifies posts that may interest you or are popular among your friends...

01:25.485 --> 01:26.985
...and recommends them to you so you don't miss out.

01:28.555 --> 01:29.520
And it works on your phone,...

01:30.020 --> 01:31.510
...so you can keep up with what your friends...

01:31.650 --> 01:33.525
...or people near you are buzzing about.

01:34.895 --> 01:35.930
When you're out in the real world,...

01:36.330 --> 01:38.065
...you usually wanna say something about where you are.

01:39.895 --> 01:40.880
Buzz makes this easy.

01:42.365 --> 01:45.405
So, try it out. Click the Buzz link in Gmail to get started...
