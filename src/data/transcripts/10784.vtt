It's just that the whole culture is so different to Europe.

00:03.550 --> 00:04.600
That's what I think.

00:05.750 --> 00:06.900
What about you? How do you...

00:07.550 --> 00:11.700
It seems that, I mean, in a lot of our... where our travels take us...

00:12.100 --> 00:14.800
...throughout Europe obviously and America, and Canada.

00:15.750 --> 00:18.800
And there's not that much difference in American culture and Irish culture now...

00:18.850 --> 00:21.900
...because we're so influenced by TV and by American culture.

00:21.950 --> 00:24.900
And so, it's kind of getting closer and closer together.

00:25.400 --> 00:28.650
So yeah, Japan is so different. It's great.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.650
So, can I say that Japan is one of your favorite places?

00:34.050 --> 00:36.900
Definitely. Yes, we really love coming here.

00:36.950 --> 00:39.050
It's always... it's like being on holidays.

00:39.100 --> 00:40.100
Okay!

00:40.450 --> 00:44.500
So, what about the Japanese audience when you play live?

00:45.300 --> 00:46.450
Oh, great!

00:47.100 --> 00:49.100
Well, they get what we're about.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.300
They understand what we're trying to put across.

00:51.900 --> 00:56.100
Because I feel that the Japanese audience tend to be more passive about...

00:57.800 --> 01:01.850
We were told that way back in 1997 before we came here the first time,...

01:02.350 --> 01:03.350
...that we should be aware of that.

01:03.600 --> 01:08.600
And that the reaction from the Japanese audience won't be what you're normally used to.

01:09.500 --> 01:10.950
But that was totally wrong, they were great.

01:11.700 --> 01:16.100
I think when people came out to see us, they knew it was going to be Irish traditional music.

01:16.150 --> 01:20.050
And maybe it gives people a license to enjoy themselves.

01:20.500 --> 01:20.950
I don't know.

01:21.500 --> 01:25.350
You know, I have a feeling from talking to Japanese people...

01:25.400 --> 01:29.600
...that they look at us as if we enjoy ourselves.

01:29.800 --> 01:34.150
So, maybe people come... the audience feel, "Well, it's time to enjoy ourselves."

01:34.200 --> 01:35.200
Okay.

01:35.350 --> 01:38.100
Maybe. I don't know. That's only my theory, you know.
