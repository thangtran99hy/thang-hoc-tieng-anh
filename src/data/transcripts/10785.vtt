00:04.065 --> 00:06.605
One day, a cat hiked on a mountain.

00:07.230 --> 00:09.720
When he reached the peak, he met a fox.

00:10.190 --> 00:13.895
They began talking about how they get away from their enemies.

00:14.560 --> 00:18.720
"I am very smart. I have billions of ideas."

00:19.260 --> 00:24.955
"I can carve a tiny hole in a tree and then climb in," the fox said.

00:25.490 --> 00:28.385
He added, "I have a lot of friends."

00:28.655 --> 00:32.390
"If I am in trouble, I can call them to lend their help."

00:32.755 --> 00:35.885
"I can escape an entire army if I have to!"

00:36.720 --> 00:40.515
Then the fox asked, "What are your potential plans?"

00:41.085 --> 00:44.270
The cat said, "I have only one plan."

00:44.985 --> 00:48.520
The fox said, "I hope you have good fortune then!"

00:49.115 --> 00:53.755
"Do you want me to be your tutor? I can teach you many things."

00:54.480 --> 00:59.180
The cat said, "I guarantee that my plan works every time."

00:59.680 --> 01:01.345
"We can quit talking about it."

01:02.175 --> 01:04.745
Soon, they saw a group of wolves.

01:05.145 --> 01:06.655
It was an emergency.

01:07.110 --> 01:09.440
The cat quickly used her plan.

01:09.810 --> 01:11.230
She ran up a tree.

01:11.940 --> 01:14.920
The fox could not decide which plan to use.

01:15.610 --> 01:17.475
"What should my initial move be?"

01:18.005 --> 01:19.775
"Should I consult my friends?"

01:20.140 --> 01:22.655
The fox felt intense anxiety.

01:23.005 --> 01:25.495
All he could do was spin in a circle.

01:26.035 --> 01:27.990
The wolves caught the fox.

01:28.370 --> 01:30.365
The cat was full of pride.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.700
This is proof that having a good plan...

01:33.900 --> 01:36.865
...is better than having many bad plans.
