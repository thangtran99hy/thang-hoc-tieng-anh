00:01.200 --> 00:03.500
Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:03.900 --> 00:05.050
I'm your maitre d', Seita.

00:05.550 --> 00:08.600
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:09.850 --> 00:11.050
Today's Maestro Hook,...

00:11.700 --> 00:15.600
...the Maestro Hook is a small conversation piece that you can use with foreigners...

00:15.900 --> 00:17.250
...to get a good conversation going.

00:17.850 --> 00:18.950
Today is about presents.

00:19.850 --> 00:23.500
In America, when you get a present, you open it in front of the person.

00:23.700 --> 00:25.300
If it's food, you even eat it.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Of course in Japan, when you get a present, you don't open it and you take it home,...

00:30.200 --> 00:32.150
...and you open it later, and thank them later.

00:32.700 --> 00:33.750
There's a little bit of difference there.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.100
For example, when you get a present in America,...

00:37.700 --> 00:38.950
..."Oh, thank you!"

00:40.100 --> 00:40.800
"Can I open it?"

00:41.900 --> 00:45.550
"Oh! This is food. I'm gonna try it."

00:47.750 --> 00:49.200
"Oh! It's very good. Thank you!"

00:54.100 --> 00:57.500
Okay, today's Maestro Menu...

01:07.950 --> 01:09.000
It's nothing special.

01:10.050 --> 01:11.000
It's nothing special.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.000
Oh, it's nothing special.

01:21.850 --> 01:22.850
It's nothing special.

01:29.600 --> 01:30.950
Oh! You shouldn't have.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.550
Oh! You shouldn't have.

01:42.150 --> 01:43.350
Oh! You shouldn't have.

01:45.250 --> 01:48.450
Okay. Next, Maestro Lines.

01:52.500 --> 01:53.400
"I got you something."

01:54.100 --> 01:55.800
"Oh, really? Thank you!"

01:56.150 --> 01:57.900
"Oh, no, no. It's nothing special."

01:59.150 --> 02:02.300
"Oh! You shouldn't have. I'm so sorry, thank you!"

02:02.600 --> 02:04.200
"Oh! Please enjoy it."

02:08.200 --> 02:10.200
Okay, that's it for today.

02:10.400 --> 02:14.350
And we'll see you again next week on AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

02:15.250 --> 02:15.750
See you later!
