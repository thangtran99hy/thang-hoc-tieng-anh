00:06.030 --> 00:08.975
It was 25 years ago that my father found him.

00:10.860 --> 00:13.480
He was torn to pieces and half-eaten.

00:14.380 --> 00:15.215
Whatever did it...

00:15.715 --> 00:16.545
...was big...

00:17.725 --> 00:19.355
...and a buckshot couldn't kill it.

00:20.730 --> 00:24.725
After that, my father went home and cast silver bullets.

00:27.595 --> 00:31.560
And wouldn't leave the house on a full moon from then on.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.275
Lo and behold, the prodigal son returns.

00:42.475 --> 00:43.200
Hello, father.

00:43.390 --> 00:44.545
You've come here for the funeral.

00:44.940 --> 00:45.475
What happened?

00:45.775 --> 00:47.815
Your brother's body was found on a ditch.

00:48.145 --> 00:49.815
He'd been torn to pieces.

00:50.040 --> 00:52.385
If there's anything you need, please let me know.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.420
I want to know what happened to him.

00:55.020 --> 00:57.190
Francis Abberline, Scotland Yard.

00:57.320 --> 01:00.495
I cannot stress enough the mortal peril you're in.

01:00.960 --> 01:03.195
What kind of animal could have done such a thing?

01:04.430 --> 01:05.495
You're risking your life.

01:06.665 --> 01:07.865
Darkness comes for you.

01:10.290 --> 01:11.870
He's been quite seriously injured.

01:12.505 --> 01:13.635
Thank you for staying with me.

01:13.805 --> 01:15.200
Now we know it's still out there.

01:15.505 --> 01:17.005
You were bitten by the beast.

01:17.170 --> 01:18.410
You bear his mark now.

01:19.130 --> 01:20.345
Do you believe in curses?

01:22.215 --> 01:23.140
You have to leave.

01:23.265 --> 01:24.650
What are you afraid of?

01:24.730 --> 01:29.725
There are those who doubt the power to change men into beasts.

01:30.620 --> 01:32.625
A beast has come among us.

01:34.860 --> 01:38.795
Terrible things, Lawrence. You've done terrible things.

01:39.995 --> 01:41.065
Be strong, son.

01:41.730 --> 01:42.435
Be strong.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.900
I am what they say I am.

01:45.505 --> 01:46.240
I'm a monster.

01:47.070 --> 01:49.030
I will kill all of you.

01:54.145 --> 01:55.080
Let me help you.

02:02.480 --> 02:03.625
The beast will have its day.
