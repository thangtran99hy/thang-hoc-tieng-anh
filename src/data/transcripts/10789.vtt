00:03.565 --> 00:06.165
Sue left her dormitory early that morning.

00:06.865 --> 00:09.465
She had even washed her uniform the night before.

00:10.160 --> 00:12.130
She wanted to look nice for the day.

00:13.160 --> 00:14.900
Sue was committed to learning,...

00:15.227 --> 00:17.450
...and she had a talent for getting good grades.

00:18.325 --> 00:20.895
In fact, Sue didn't sleep much.

00:21.660 --> 00:26.290
She composed a paper and found the perfect thesis about the importance of greenhouses.

00:27.190 --> 00:29.390
She also studied for her physics test.

00:30.225 --> 00:31.955
Sue was already tired.

00:32.755 --> 00:35.455
During the test, she calculated her answers.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.355
Soon, she felt sick.

00:39.255 --> 00:42.720
Her face got hot and her vision began to blur.

00:43.520 --> 00:44.950
She was blind for a moment.

00:45.785 --> 00:48.085
The teacher saw Sue's apparent sickness.

00:49.015 --> 00:52.381
He wanted to send her to the nurse, but she wouldn't go.

00:53.280 --> 00:55.745
Sue still had a portion of the test to finish.

00:56.615 --> 00:59.045
After that, Sue went to the nurse.

00:59.980 --> 01:02.275
After seeing the secretary, she waited.

01:03.245 --> 01:06.445
A few minutes later, the nurse came in with a glass of juice...

01:06.775 --> 01:08.445
...and told Sue they needed to chat.

01:09.840 --> 01:13.405
"It is obvious you have exhausted yourself," the nurse said.

01:14.400 --> 01:18.040
"If you keep working so hard, it could have severe results."

01:18.805 --> 01:20.885
"My parents tell me that all the time."

01:21.505 --> 01:24.205
"I guess I shouldn't ignore them," Sue said.

01:24.970 --> 01:29.435
"You have to remind yourself it is OK to rest," the nurse said.

01:30.235 --> 01:33.365
When Sue got back to her room, she went right to bed.

01:34.135 --> 01:37.300
She made sure she got enough rest every night after that.
