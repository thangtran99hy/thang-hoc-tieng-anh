00:03.435 --> 00:07.240
I've devoted my life to studying past generations.

00:07.670 --> 00:11.510
Last year, I had a unique chance to work with my uncle.

00:12.010 --> 00:16.505
Our job was to find old treasures for a school's history foundation.

00:17.115 --> 00:19.320
He also hired a crew of students.

00:19.985 --> 00:22.225
They signed a contract to work with him.

00:22.655 --> 00:23.890
He was the boss.

00:24.390 --> 00:26.160
The place was strange, though.

00:26.555 --> 00:30.430
I dined on many things that I had never tasted before.

00:30.865 --> 00:32.765
They had an unusual flavor.

00:33.560 --> 00:37.170
We had been there about a month and hadn't found anything.

00:37.505 --> 00:40.440
One day, I began to dig in the soil.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.935
The ground's layers got wetter.

00:43.305 --> 00:45.545
Soon I was digging in the mud.

00:45.875 --> 00:48.615
My shovel began to get very heavy.

00:48.980 --> 00:51.285
It felt like it had doubled in weight...

00:51.480 --> 00:54.255
...because the ground had absorbed a lot of water.

00:54.820 --> 00:57.255
Finally, I saw something in the mud.

00:57.525 --> 00:59.092
It was an old knife!

00:59.680 --> 01:02.095
The handle felt smooth in my hand.

01:02.525 --> 01:05.065
I elevated it so I could see it better.

01:05.465 --> 01:06.800
There was writing on it.

01:07.200 --> 01:11.135
"It says it will bring good luck," my uncle said with a smile.

01:11.435 --> 01:12.675
"Why don't you keep it?"

01:13.170 --> 01:14.595
I put it in my tent.

01:15.375 --> 01:18.745
The next day, we found many more things.

01:19.045 --> 01:22.015
There were pots, jewelry, and weapons.

01:22.615 --> 01:26.285
My uncle donated all of the things to a special committee.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.155
Many newspapers wrote stories about it.

01:29.620 --> 01:32.595
It seemed the knife really did bring good luck!
