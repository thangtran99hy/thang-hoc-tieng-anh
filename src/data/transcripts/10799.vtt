00:00.100 --> 00:01.500
For all that I have done,...

00:05.200 --> 00:06.200
...I am so sorry.

00:11.700 --> 00:13.400
I have a lot to atone for...

00:15.800 --> 00:19.400
...but there is one issue I really want to discuss.

00:20.700 --> 00:23.350
Some people have speculated that Elin somehow hurt...

00:23.400 --> 00:26.050
...or attacked me on Thanksgiving night.

00:27.250 --> 00:30.300
It angers me that people would fabricate a story like that.

00:31.200 --> 00:34.600
Elin never hit me that night or any other night.

00:35.350 --> 00:40.150
There has never been an episode of domestic violence in our marriage, ever.

00:41.650 --> 00:48.450
Elin has shown enormous grace and poise throughout this ordeal.

00:53.050 --> 00:56.750
Elin deserves praise, not blame.

00:59.700 --> 01:04.800
The issue involved here was my repeated irresponsible behavior.

01:05.500 --> 01:06.900
I was unfaithful.

01:07.550 --> 01:08.650
I had affairs.

01:09.200 --> 01:09.900
I cheated.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.800
What I did is not acceptable...

01:13.850 --> 01:16.200
...and I am the only person to blame.

01:18.200 --> 01:22.450
I stopped living by the core values that I was taught to believe in.

01:24.300 --> 01:25.650
I knew my actions were wrong...

01:26.300 --> 01:29.850
...but I convinced myself that normal rules didn't apply.

01:31.150 --> 01:33.950
I never thought about who I was hurting.

01:34.700 --> 01:39.200
Instead, I thought only about myself.

01:40.700 --> 01:44.100
I ran straight through the boundaries that a married couple should live by.

01:45.050 --> 01:47.950
I thought I could get away with whatever I wanted to.

01:48.950 --> 01:51.700
I felt that I had worked hard my entire life...

01:52.350 --> 01:56.000
...and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me.

01:56.900 --> 01:58.700
I felt I was entitled.

01:59.800 --> 02:01.400
Thanks to money and fame,...

02:04.400 --> 02:06.250
...I didn't have to go far to find them.
