00:01.300 --> 00:02.200
I was wrong.

00:02.650 --> 00:03.600
I was foolish.

00:04.500 --> 00:06.200
I don't get to play by different rules.

00:06.700 --> 00:11.450
The same boundaries that apply to everyone apply to me.

00:12.900 --> 00:14.850
I brought this shame on myself.

00:15.550 --> 00:18.150
I hurt my wife, my kids,...

00:19.550 --> 00:22.750
...my mother, my wife's family,...

00:24.400 --> 00:26.700
...my friends, my foundation...

00:27.400 --> 00:30.400
...and kids all around the world who admired me.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.100
I've had a lot of time to think about what I've done.

00:36.050 --> 00:41.000
My failures have made me look at myself...

00:41.800 --> 00:44.900
...in a way I never wanted to before.

00:46.900 --> 00:48.950
It's now up to me to make amends...

00:49.650 --> 00:52.850
...and that starts by never repeating the mistakes I've made.

00:53.650 --> 00:57.100
It's up to me to start living a life of integrity.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.800
I once heard and I believe it's true,...

01:03.050 --> 01:05.300
...it's not what you achieve in life that matters,...

01:06.350 --> 01:07.450
...it's what you overcome.

01:09.350 --> 01:14.100
Achievements on the golf course are only part of setting an example.

01:15.050 --> 01:19.500
Character and decency are what really count.
