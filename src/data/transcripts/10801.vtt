Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:03.550 --> 00:04.850
I am your maitre d' Seita.

00:05.600 --> 00:08.700
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:09.600 --> 00:12.300
Alright, today's Maestro Hook.

00:13.300 --> 00:16.500
Maestro Hook is a small conversation piece that you can use with foreigners...

00:16.800 --> 00:18.400
...and it'll make a conversation exciting.

00:19.150 --> 00:22.250
Today's Hook is about comparing yourself to a celebrity.

00:23.650 --> 00:28.400
In Japan, I experience a lot of people comparing somebody to a foreigner...

00:29.050 --> 00:30.650
...and comparing themselves to a celebrity.

00:31.450 --> 00:33.700
Saying, "Oh, you look like so-and-so."...

00:34.300 --> 00:37.300
...or, "Oh, you look like the celebrity, what's-his-name? So-and-so."

00:38.050 --> 00:40.950
And for a foreigner, that's really, really strange.

00:41.450 --> 00:44.700
A lot of times they compare themselves to someone on TV...

00:46.500 --> 00:49.400
We don't really feel comfortable and we don't really know how to react.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.800
It's not like we know the person or it's not like we're related,...

00:52.850 --> 00:56.700
...so the reaction that we always give in a situation like that is,...

00:56.750 --> 00:58.250
..."Um, yeah, thanks and so?"

00:59.100 --> 01:01.350
Even if the person is beautiful or good-looking,...

01:01.750 --> 01:03.700
...it's not so much of a compliment.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.000
So, be careful when you do that...

01:06.075 --> 01:09.750
...'cause in the States, we don't really have that kind of a culture, okay?

01:13.250 --> 01:14.950
Okay, today's Maestro Menu...

01:21.450 --> 01:22.900
You're a spitting image of...

01:23.950 --> 01:25.200
You're a spitting image of...

01:31.850 --> 01:33.650
You're a spitting image of your father.

01:51.900 --> 01:52.900
I get that a lot.

01:53.850 --> 01:54.900
I get that a lot.

02:04.250 --> 02:05.000
I get that a lot.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.000
Okay, Maestro Line:...

02:19.400 --> 02:21.250
...Wow! I haven't seen you in a long time...

02:21.300 --> 02:23.150
...but you're a spitting image of your mother.

02:24.050 --> 02:25.600
Oh, thanks! I get that a lot.

02:25.850 --> 02:27.000
We really do look alike.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.800
Okay, that's it for today...

02:33.950 --> 02:38.650
...and see you next week again on a new episode of AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

02:39.350 --> 02:39.750
Bye-bye!
