00:09.700 --> 00:11.250
Watch out! Waaa!

00:11.350 --> 00:12.150
Mom!

00:12.250 --> 00:14.500
No, no, no, no, just keep playing. Just pretend I'm not here.

00:15.050 --> 00:16.250
Does the red light mean it's going?

00:32.800 --> 00:34.400
Andy's going to college.

00:34.550 --> 00:35.500
Can you believe it?

00:35.700 --> 00:37.250
Mom, I'm not leaving 'til Friday.

00:37.700 --> 00:39.550
What are you gonna do with these old toys?

00:57.350 --> 00:58.100
Don't you get it?

00:58.250 --> 01:00.450
We're finished, obsolete, over the hill!

01:02.100 --> 01:05.000
Now come on guys, we all knew this day was coming.

01:05.050 --> 01:06.200
We're getting thrown away?

01:06.250 --> 01:07.800
No. No one's getting thrown away.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.550
We ain't ever getting played with.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.450
Hold on, this is no time to be hysterical.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.400
But it's the perfect time to be hysterical!

01:13.450 --> 01:14.950
Should we be hysterical?

01:15.350 --> 01:15.650
Yeah!

01:15.700 --> 01:17.300
Maybe, but not right now.

01:17.350 --> 01:19.850
Come on, let's see how much we're going for in eBay.

01:21.250 --> 01:22.350
New toys!

01:22.400 --> 01:24.150
At last! I'm gonna get played with!

01:33.550 --> 01:34.250
Where's my nose?

01:34.300 --> 01:34.800
Here it is.

01:34.850 --> 01:35.500
Here's your arm.

01:35.600 --> 01:36.450
Give me that. That's mine.

01:36.500 --> 01:37.050
The mustache?

01:39.750 --> 01:40.750
We're busting outta here.

01:40.900 --> 01:42.350
On three: one...

01:42.500 --> 01:43.000
Three!

01:44.550 --> 01:46.700
To infinity and beyond!

01:48.350 --> 01:51.350
To reset your Buzz Lightyear, insert paper clip...

01:51.400 --> 01:52.250
Rex, use your finger!

01:54.350 --> 01:55.650
Did you fix Buzz?

02:00.950 --> 02:02.050
Er, sort of.

02:06.700 --> 02:07.700
Oh, no.

02:07.750 --> 02:10.100
Oh yes! Return of the Astronut.
