00:03.370 --> 00:05.605
A young priest was always sad.

00:06.440 --> 00:10.175
He was good at his profession but he still had no joy.

00:10.710 --> 00:12.990
He visited a group of wise monks.

00:13.480 --> 00:17.050
When he got to the monks' house, they greeted him and let him in.

00:17.450 --> 00:20.485
The monks asked the priest, "What is the matter?"

00:21.055 --> 00:25.455
The priest said, "I should be happy but I am not."

00:25.890 --> 00:27.295
"I don't know what to do."

00:27.960 --> 00:29.895
The wise monks paused for a minute.

00:30.795 --> 00:34.000
Then one said, "We are convinced of your faith."

00:34.435 --> 00:36.070
"You are a very good priest."

00:36.535 --> 00:39.185
"But to find joy, you have to do more."

00:39.575 --> 00:43.645
"Above all, investigate the elements of your life that you love."

00:44.240 --> 00:48.215
The priest thought that this answer was odd but he was curious.

00:48.480 --> 00:51.495
The next day, the priest thought about his abilities.

00:51.850 --> 00:55.500
He got a few ideas and he did not want to delay any longer.

00:55.985 --> 00:59.055
He liked to draw so he made some cartoons.

00:59.625 --> 01:02.895
He also liked to write so he started a diary.

01:03.670 --> 01:07.685
He was interested in agriculture so he planted some grains.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.835
He made jam from berries.

01:10.270 --> 01:13.185
He made his own labels to put on the jars of jam.

01:13.870 --> 01:15.110
He painted his ceiling.

01:15.975 --> 01:17.410
The priest learned something.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.310
It is not too hard to be happy after all.

01:21.080 --> 01:24.985
All one has to do is find things they like doing and do them!
