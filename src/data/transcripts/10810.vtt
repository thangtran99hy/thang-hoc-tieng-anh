00:10.700 --> 00:12.000
The dangers are near.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.400
You are your father's son.

00:17.450 --> 00:21.050

00:22.900 --> 00:24.800

00:25.200 --> 00:27.700

00:29.700 --> 00:31.850
Are you ready to be who you are?

00:32.200 --> 00:32.600

00:38.500 --> 00:41.750
What we ask for is liberty by law!
