00:00.600 --> 00:02.200
It's like no other beverage on the planet.

00:02.550 --> 00:06.850
Wow! You are earning your name as Sake Dendoshi, Nihonshu Dendoshi.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.600
You are clearly proselytizing me.

00:13.250 --> 00:14.050
That is what I'm trying to do.

00:14.100 --> 00:16.700
What I mean, it's coming out of a pure again, a passion for it.

00:18.950 --> 00:21.250
So, do you think you're making a dent?

00:22.050 --> 00:22.750
A dent?

00:23.650 --> 00:24.300
Are you changing?

00:24.550 --> 00:27.800
Obviously, you're changing out of how to tend to the foreigners and media columns...

00:29.350 --> 00:34.200
Yes, and because I aim for the distribution industry,...

00:34.450 --> 00:35.450
...they make dents too.

00:35.750 --> 00:36.100
Okay.

00:36.150 --> 00:37.200
But here, let me add this,...

00:37.500 --> 00:39.100
...if the sake booze of Japan,...

00:39.600 --> 00:41.900
...the sake booze, we're not making such good stuff,...

00:42.100 --> 00:43.050
...then I have nothing to talk about.

00:44.100 --> 00:45.650
Wow, so you're a big fan.

00:45.900 --> 00:47.050
You're a fan as well as...

00:47.450 --> 00:49.600
Oh absolutely, yeah. I couldn't do this if I wasn't a fan.

00:51.150 --> 00:52.900
It's not to the point where I would criticize you.

00:54.250 --> 00:58.200
Although there's just so much left to be understood.

00:58.700 --> 01:03.750
So much that in other words, sake isn't in some level where you can start criticizing it.
