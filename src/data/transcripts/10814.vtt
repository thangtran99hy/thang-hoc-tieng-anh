Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:03.650 --> 00:04.750
I am your maitre d' Seita.

00:05.250 --> 00:08.550
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:09.500 --> 00:11.850
Okay, today's Native Hook.

00:12.500 --> 00:15.600
The Native Hook is a good conversation piece that you can use with people...

00:15.900 --> 00:17.200
...and make the conversation exciting.

00:17.900 --> 00:18.900
Today's topic is about:...

00:19.200 --> 00:20.800
..."Who pays for lunch or dinner?"

00:21.450 --> 00:24.700
So, when you eat out and you order lots of food,...

00:24.800 --> 00:26.550
...and it comes time for somebody to pay,...

00:27.550 --> 00:29.650
...in Japan, a lot of people go Dutch.

00:30.550 --> 00:33.200
You pay pretty exactly how much you ate for.

00:33.950 --> 00:36.650
But in the States, we don't really do that so often.

00:36.900 --> 00:38.400
We basically buy for each other.

00:39.450 --> 00:41.650
We basically pay for each other because,...

00:41.900 --> 00:43.000
...you know, it goes around.

00:43.150 --> 00:45.600
And a lot of times, a lot of people pay for you.

00:45.700 --> 00:47.200
And at the end, you pay too.

00:47.550 --> 00:48.650
So there's a good balance.

00:48.950 --> 00:50.800
So that's a little difference between the States and Japan.

00:51.950 --> 00:52.350
Alright.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.700
Okay, today's Maestro Menu.

01:08.650 --> 01:09.300
It's on me.

01:10.750 --> 01:11.350
It's on me.

01:17.950 --> 01:18.750
It's on me today.

01:27.300 --> 01:28.450
I'll get you the next time.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.000
I'll get you the next time.

01:37.150 --> 01:37.550
Okay.

01:41.350 --> 01:44.600
Okay. So next, Maestro Lines.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.050
Hey guys! It's on me today.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.100
Oh thanks! Okay, I'll get you the next time.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.450
Okay, that's it for today.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.600
Thanks for watching AERA English TV...

02:00.900 --> 02:03.050
...and I'll see you next week. Bye-bye!
