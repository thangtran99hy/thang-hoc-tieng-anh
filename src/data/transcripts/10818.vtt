The French love to demonstrate...

00:03.805 --> 00:05.800
...against the price of milk,...

00:06.485 --> 00:12.435
...against capitalism, global warming and even against advertising.

00:13.365 --> 00:17.035
Hence, this demonstration that I photographed...

00:17.450 --> 00:21.925
...in front of La Sorbonne University on the Boulevard Saint Germain,...

00:22.365 --> 00:25.905
...where people were holding posters saying,...

00:26.600 --> 00:30.900
..."No commercials that target children on television."

00:32.490 --> 00:37.665
For your information, French children spend an average...

00:37.900 --> 00:42.000
...of 131 minutes in front of a TV screen.

00:43.265 --> 00:45.615
It is less than the British children,...

00:46.025 --> 00:47.865
...134 minutes...

00:48.235 --> 00:52.965
...but much more than the German children, 90 minutes.
