One year ago,...

00:08.540 --> 00:12.245
...an elite commando unit was sent to prison for a crime they didn't commit.

00:14.545 --> 00:17.870
These men promptly escaped from a maximum security facility.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.155
Today, still wanted by the government...

00:24.490 --> 00:26.250
...they survive as soldiers for hire.

00:32.350 --> 00:33.745
This is beyond nuts, boss.

00:35.400 --> 00:36.300
It gets better.

00:37.875 --> 00:38.635
Now we're talking.

00:39.070 --> 00:39.705
You missed me?

00:39.840 --> 00:41.355
'Cause I missed you!

00:46.980 --> 00:48.250
If you have a problem,...

00:49.715 --> 00:51.220
...if no one else can help...

00:53.020 --> 00:54.185
...and if you can find them,...

00:56.455 --> 00:57.490
It sucks to be you, homie.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.995
You look like you got a real bad attitude.

01:03.665 --> 01:05.030
...maybe you can hire...

01:06.865 --> 01:08.925
I love it when a plan comes together.

01:13.570 --> 01:14.525
...The A-Team.

01:15.340 --> 01:16.375
What the hell is that?

01:16.585 --> 01:18.570
If you look out on the right-hand side of the aircraft,...

01:18.700 --> 01:20.580
...you'll notice that the right wing is on fire.
