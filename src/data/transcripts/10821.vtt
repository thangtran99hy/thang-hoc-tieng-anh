00:04.550 --> 00:05.200
We got a walk-in.

00:06.200 --> 00:06.800
A defector.

00:08.650 --> 00:09.150
He's Russian.

00:10.650 --> 00:11.450
Neuroscan is up.

00:12.050 --> 00:12.400
Ev.

00:18.600 --> 00:19.200
What's your name?

00:19.400 --> 00:21.650
My name is Vassily Orlov.

00:22.600 --> 00:23.050
Nothing.

00:23.250 --> 00:24.050
He doesn't exist.

00:25.100 --> 00:28.800
Today, a Russian agent will travel to New York City...

00:29.350 --> 00:30.550
...to kill the President.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.900
This agent is KA12.

00:36.500 --> 00:39.100
The KA Program is a myth.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.800
Scan says he's truthful.

00:40.850 --> 00:41.900
This guy is selling smoke.

00:41.950 --> 00:42.700
Wrap it up, Ev.

00:43.300 --> 00:45.350
Don't you want to know the name?

00:45.550 --> 00:46.225
You're good!

00:46.600 --> 00:49.300
You can tell the rest of your story to one of my colleagues.

00:49.350 --> 00:52.400
The name of the agent is Evelyn Salt.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.250
My name is Evelyn Salt.

00:54.650 --> 00:56.300
Then you are a Russian spy.

01:00.200 --> 01:00.700
Where'd she go?

01:01.600 --> 01:02.400
What are you doing, Ev?

01:03.650 --> 01:04.400
This doesn't look good.

01:04.700 --> 01:05.900
I'm not a Russian spy.

01:10.700 --> 01:11.450
On the ground!

01:11.600 --> 01:12.450
I'm innocent.

01:12.600 --> 01:13.900
Somebody's setting me up.

01:13.950 --> 01:15.000
Salt, no!

01:17.550 --> 01:19.200
Maybe Salt is who she says she is.

01:20.600 --> 01:21.650
"Maybe" is your department.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.250
Mine is catching her so we can find out.

01:29.250 --> 01:29.900
Drop it!
