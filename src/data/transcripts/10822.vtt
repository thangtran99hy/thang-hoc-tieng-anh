00:04.035 --> 00:04.950
I'm so sorry.

00:05.470 --> 00:05.970
Boston?

00:06.490 --> 00:06.805
Yeah.

00:08.040 --> 00:08.575
Gate 12.

00:10.810 --> 00:12.190
I wanna talk about the plane crash.

00:12.310 --> 00:12.710
What about it?

00:13.165 --> 00:13.635
I was in it.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.290
So, you were in the plane crash?

00:15.415 --> 00:17.385
I mean, I wasn't supposed to be on that plane but I was on it.

00:17.510 --> 00:18.430
And there was this guy...

00:19.315 --> 00:22.125
...who was some sort of... like a secret agent or something.

00:26.595 --> 00:27.475
Ocupado!

00:29.795 --> 00:31.530
And he killed everybody on board.

00:35.300 --> 00:35.985
Pilots are dead.

00:36.120 --> 00:36.870
The enemy shot them.

00:36.980 --> 00:37.570
By who?

00:37.835 --> 00:38.175
Me.

00:38.370 --> 00:40.615
Actually, I shot the first pilot...

00:41.240 --> 00:43.135
...and he shot the second one accidentally.

00:45.010 --> 00:45.880
It's one of those things.

00:47.745 --> 00:49.015
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

00:54.155 --> 00:55.755
The next thing you know, I wake up,...

00:56.020 --> 00:57.925
...I'm in my room. I have no idea how I got there.

00:58.025 --> 00:59.080
And then, I go to April's fitting...

00:59.200 --> 01:00.895
...because I have to wear this ridiculous dress.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.665
These other guys, these other agents come.

01:02.810 --> 01:04.830
Ms. Havens, will you join us inside the car for a moment?

01:05.065 --> 01:08.700
They snatch me up. The next thing you know, I'm in Grand Theft Auto on the I-93.

01:15.240 --> 01:15.720
Hey June!

01:16.550 --> 01:17.655
It's a beautiful dress!

01:19.045 --> 01:19.615
Where's the jacket?

01:23.615 --> 01:24.985
Whoa! It is wild!

01:29.400 --> 01:30.470
Why are you touching my hand?

01:30.590 --> 01:31.325
Because I'm here for you.

01:31.490 --> 01:33.555
It makes total sense. April is getting married...

01:33.920 --> 01:35.095
...and that is stressful.

01:35.245 --> 01:36.830
Oh no. No, no, no, no. Ok.

01:37.530 --> 01:38.020
Hi June.

01:38.265 --> 01:41.090
Maybe I didn't make it clear enough but we're gonna have to stick together.

01:41.220 --> 01:42.435
I'm sorry. Who are you?

01:42.635 --> 01:43.300
This is the guy!

01:43.400 --> 01:43.870
I'm a guy!

01:44.705 --> 01:45.235
I'm the guy!

01:46.870 --> 01:49.600
Please, for your own safety, please stay in the booth.

01:50.395 --> 01:51.475
What are you talking about?

01:53.010 --> 01:56.325
Everybody get down. No one follows us or I kill myself and then her.

02:05.825 --> 02:06.860
On three, ready?

02:06.940 --> 02:07.295
Uh huh!

02:07.660 --> 02:07.960
One...

02:15.565 --> 02:17.900
Sorry, I panicked.

02:18.095 --> 02:18.870
What number would you like?

02:19.170 --> 02:21.175
Three. Yeah! Let's just stick with three. It's good.

02:21.505 --> 02:22.045
Okay.
