And I pray that all the fear that has ever been in your heart will be taken out.

00:05.300 --> 00:08.103
And when you look at that man, if you know he's nothing but a coward,...

00:08.887 --> 00:09.562
...,you won't fear him.

00:10.225 --> 00:12.195
If he wasn't a coward, he wouldn't gang up on you.

00:12.855 --> 00:14.187
He wouldn't need to sneak around here.

00:15.251 --> 00:19.368
Once a controversial figure, Malcolm X, assassinated 45 years ago,...

00:19.445 --> 00:22.973
...is now considered an icon in the struggle for black equality.

00:23.998 --> 00:25.965
He was a leader of the Black Power movement...

00:26.528 --> 00:30.735
...and refused to renounce the use of violence by blacks in their own self-defense.

00:31.636 --> 00:35.272
Malcolm X became prominent in Chicago which boasts the only US college...

00:35.534 --> 00:36.742
...that now bears his name:...

00:37.304 --> 00:39.031
...Malcolm X Community College.

00:41.005 --> 00:44.175
Last week, a Muslim youth group screened a documentary about Malcolm X...

00:44.229 --> 00:46.411
...and put on an art show about him in Chicago.

00:47.170 --> 00:50.744
It was in this city that Malcolm X joined the Nation of Islam,...

00:51.200 --> 00:54.895
...an American offshoot of Islam that advocated separating the races.

00:55.409 --> 00:58.582
Shamar Hemphill organized the screening and the art show.

00:59.075 --> 01:01.673
He described his fascination with Malcolm X.

01:03.033 --> 01:06.152
Malcolm X is just bigger than the praise that people give him or even some of the...

01:07.959 --> 01:09.730
...negative media that he gets sometimes.

01:10.364 --> 01:11.700
He plays a role in all of our lives...

01:11.767 --> 01:15.771
...and that doesn't just mean the African-American community, but also throughout the world.

01:16.170 --> 01:19.925
The movie and performances told the story of Malcolm X's childhood...

01:20.071 --> 01:21.753
...as a victim of white supremacists,...

01:22.348 --> 01:24.867
...his early adult years as a petty criminal and prisoner,...

01:25.381 --> 01:29.938
...and then his conversion to Islam and rise to fame as a Muslim and African-American leader...

01:30.599 --> 01:33.641
...with the last name X that replaced his birth name.

01:34.323 --> 01:37.134
He said it had been imposed by white slave owners.

01:38.339 --> 01:41.149
It's a case of being a good or bad human being.

01:41.359 --> 01:44.185
Hemphill said the words of Malcolm X still resonate.

01:45.540 --> 01:49.629
It is not time for griping or complaining, but it's time for,...

01:50.396 --> 01:53.103
...you know, people in communities to take action...

01:53.493 --> 01:56.110
...and step up as leaders, and the men especially.

01:56.710 --> 02:00.586
And, you know, when I heard that phrase and read that phrase,...

02:01.258 --> 02:03.441
...I felt like he was talking to me, even now.
