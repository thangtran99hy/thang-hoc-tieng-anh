00:00.700 --> 00:03.100
We know that there will be very difficult days ahead in Iraq.

00:03.900 --> 00:05.900
There will probably be more violence.

00:06.600 --> 00:09.400
But like any sovereign, independent nation,...

00:09.600 --> 00:12.500
...Iraq must be free to chart its own course.

00:13.350 --> 00:18.850
No one should seek to influence, exploit or disrupt this period of transition.

00:19.550 --> 00:22.000
Now is the time for every neighbor and nation...

00:22.400 --> 00:25.550
...to respect Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

00:26.750 --> 00:30.900
A new Iraqi government will face important decisions about Iraq's future.

00:31.700 --> 00:33.700
But as today's voting demonstrates,...

00:33.950 --> 00:37.800
...the Iraqi people want disagreements to be debated...

00:38.350 --> 00:44.450
...and decided through a political process that provides security and prosperity for all Iraqis.

00:44.950 --> 00:45.950
And as they go forward,...

00:46.550 --> 00:51.400
...the Iraqi people must know that the United States will fulfill its obligations.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.300
We will continue with the responsible removal of United States forces from Iraq.

00:57.050 --> 00:58.600
Indeed for the first time in years,...

00:58.700 --> 01:03.500
...there are now fewer than 100,000 American troops serving in Iraq.

01:04.050 --> 01:06.850
By the end of August, our combat mission will end.

01:07.750 --> 01:11.150
As I said last year, when I announced our new strategy in Iraq,...

01:11.250 --> 01:14.650
...we will continue to advise and assist Iraqi Security Forces,...

01:15.100 --> 01:18.800
...carry out targeted counterterrorism operations with our Iraqi partners,...

01:19.200 --> 01:21.650
...and protect our forces and civilians.

01:22.050 --> 01:26.650
And by the end of next year, all U.S. troops will be out of Iraq.
