00:00.545 --> 00:02.970
Growing up, I saw my mother dedicate...

00:03.330 --> 00:06.740
...most of her life to promoting the rights and well-being of women overseas,...

00:07.040 --> 00:10.610
...to empowering them to take more control over their economic lives and...

00:11.745 --> 00:14.155
...be able to empower their families as well.

00:14.910 --> 00:17.150
I saw my grandmother work her way up to become...

00:17.815 --> 00:19.940
...vice president in a bank in Hawaii,...

00:20.050 --> 00:23.225
...starting as a secretary, never had more than a high school education.

00:23.525 --> 00:26.475
But I also saw how she hit a glass ceiling,...

00:27.095 --> 00:28.460
...and had to watch as men,...

00:28.795 --> 00:33.765
...no more qualified than she was, rise up the corporate ladder.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.870
Before we got to the White House, where we are grateful for...

00:38.530 --> 00:41.710
...the extraordinary support that we've received from the White House staff,...

00:42.535 --> 00:45.710
...I'd seen the challenges Michelle faced as a working mom.

00:46.140 --> 00:50.115
And as usual, she handled it with grace and skill, but...

00:50.585 --> 00:53.020
..she'd be the first one to tell you it wasn't always easy...

00:53.155 --> 00:57.790
...balancing the responsibilities of being a hospital executive with those of being a mother and...

00:58.225 --> 01:00.195
...sometimes worrying about the girls when she was at work,...

01:00.325 --> 01:02.525
...and sometimes worrying about work when she was with the girls.

01:03.365 --> 01:08.565
And today, as I see Sasha and Malia getting older, I think about the world that they...

01:09.135 --> 01:11.270
...and all of America's daughters will inherit.

01:11.700 --> 01:15.635
And I think about all the opportunities that are still beyond the reach for too many...

01:16.700 --> 01:21.170
...young women and too many of our brothers and sisters,...

01:21.380 --> 01:23.720
...too many of our sisters and mothers and aunts,...

01:25.085 --> 01:27.720
...all of the glass ceilings that have yet to be shattered.

01:28.420 --> 01:29.790
We have so much more work to do...

01:30.825 --> 01:32.090
...and that's why we're here today.

01:32.660 --> 01:37.295
I think about this because it reminds me of why I'm here. I didn't run for President...

01:37.565 --> 01:40.465
...so that the dreams of our daughters could be deferred or denied.

01:41.130 --> 01:44.970
I didn't run for President to see inequality and injustice persist in our time.

01:45.730 --> 01:49.340
I ran for President to put the same rights, the same opportunities,...

01:49.800 --> 01:53.480
...the same dreams within the reach for our daughters and our sons alike.

01:54.145 --> 01:59.015
I ran for President to put the American Dream within the reach of all of our people,...

01:59.250 --> 02:02.685
...no matter what their gender, or race, or faith, or station.
