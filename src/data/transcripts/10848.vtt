Hello! Welcome to Michael's Business Top Tips.

00:04.770 --> 00:07.140
This month, we're looking at a tricky subject.

00:07.475 --> 00:08.575
Conflict.

00:09.140 --> 00:12.810
Now often in business, we have hot conflict situations.

00:13.380 --> 00:16.750
How can we make these constructive or productive?

00:17.550 --> 00:21.170
One approach is the interest-based relational approach.

00:21.985 --> 00:23.160
What this means is...

00:23.490 --> 00:24.865
...two key points.

00:25.590 --> 00:30.430
First, separate interests from positions.

00:31.230 --> 00:33.710
Position is what somebody is saying.

00:34.500 --> 00:38.305
The interest is the underlying reason behind it.

00:39.005 --> 00:42.010
Often the conflict is because of positions clashing.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.810
If you understand the interests,...

00:45.075 --> 00:46.945
...often you can reach a compromise.

00:47.780 --> 00:52.255
For example, say two small children are fighting over a pumpkin.

00:53.585 --> 00:56.585
Now, both of them want the pumpkin. That's their positions.

00:57.055 --> 00:58.335
However, if I taunt them,...

00:58.525 --> 01:02.725
...I find out one wants just the inside to bake a pumpkin pie.

01:03.430 --> 01:08.150
The other wants just the outside to make a jack-o'-lantern for Halloween.

01:09.135 --> 01:13.340
So, by understanding the interests, I can help them solve the conflict.

01:14.605 --> 01:16.140
Second, relationship.

01:16.545 --> 01:18.775
Focus on keeping a good relationship...

01:19.145 --> 01:23.685
...by using active listening, showing understanding and respect to the other person.

01:24.485 --> 01:28.720
These are two techniques to help make conflict constructive.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.330
Thank you and good luck!
