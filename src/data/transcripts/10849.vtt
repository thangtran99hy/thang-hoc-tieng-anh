00:01.200 --> 00:03.050
For example, when you played this part...

00:03.650 --> 00:05.750
...in "Memoirs of a Teenage Amnesiac",...

00:06.250 --> 00:08.800
...did it add something to your understanding?

00:10.350 --> 00:11.400
The requisite PR cut.

00:11.600 --> 00:11.800
Yeah.

00:12.350 --> 00:14.800
Did it add something to your understanding of yourself?

00:14.850 --> 00:18.050
Or was this an interesting new life for you to try?

00:18.150 --> 00:20.500
Absolutely, 'cause I'm not a tennis-playing jock.

00:20.550 --> 00:23.850
And so I thought, it was fun to do that and to be this guy,...

00:23.900 --> 00:26.400
...and he just doesn't care at all.

00:28.350 --> 00:30.350
You don't pressure your girlfriends to have sex with you after?

00:31.550 --> 00:32.850
Why do I have to need to pressure?

00:34.700 --> 00:36.600
Yeah, you're getting pressured It goes the other way around.

00:36.650 --> 00:37.700
Yeah. Yeah. That's right!

00:38.250 --> 00:40.050
I'm too tired, I am sorry.

00:41.150 --> 00:41.750
Again?

00:41.950 --> 00:42.300
Yeah.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.300
No. Yeah. Yeah. I think it was great.

00:47.400 --> 00:50.150
I mean, I especially like the character and also...

00:50.700 --> 00:53.250
...being out here again working with Ken'ichi and Maki,...

00:54.550 --> 00:56.600
...Maki, most obviously.

00:57.350 --> 00:59.000
But I got to know Ken'ichi as well in here...

01:01.050 --> 01:01.500
There they are.

01:02.200 --> 01:02.550
There you go.

01:02.600 --> 01:03.400
The requisite PR shot.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.700
In case you don't know who I'm talking about.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.050
In case you're not sure which movie we're talking about.

01:08.700 --> 01:09.750
We're talking about this film.
