Yeah, I wanted it to be a little bit of an inspiration and it has been.

00:04.700 --> 00:07.600
Almost every day I get an e-mail from someone in,...

00:08.050 --> 00:10.250
...you know, London or around Europe,...

00:12.050 --> 00:16.150
...who are inspired to go after their dream job after reading my book,...

00:20.100 --> 00:23.200
...especially women, you know, ages 18 to 28.

00:23.250 --> 00:24.950
When you're just starting off in your career,...

00:25.000 --> 00:29.700
...a lot of times you're not in the position where you'd like to be.

00:29.750 --> 00:32.300
And it's how you get there?

00:32.350 --> 00:34.500
And, you know, is anyone gonna help you?

00:34.550 --> 00:36.450
Is everybody against you?

00:37.300 --> 00:41.650
And this girl and the main character in my book, keeps getting a knock-back after knock-back,...

00:42.600 --> 00:48.750
...which I feel is like a story a lot of people can relate to.

00:49.200 --> 00:53.175
And so, yeah. I just never gave up.

00:53.225 --> 00:56.900
And I feel like a lot of women should never give up,...

00:56.950 --> 01:00.350
...you know, especially in male dominated industries like banking and law,...

01:00.400 --> 01:03.400
...where the odds are stacked against you from the beginning.

01:05.150 --> 01:08.100
So yeah, I think I wanted to become a trader...

01:09.150 --> 01:12.100
...and after a lot of fighting, I did.
