00:09.300 --> 00:12.600
By the time that the pizza man came,...

00:13.000 --> 00:15.950
...everyone had all gone to bed.

00:18.050 --> 00:21.500
When the dog food finally arrived,...

00:21.850 --> 00:24.750
...the dog had already been fed.

00:26.900 --> 00:31.350
Why is everybody always late?

00:35.750 --> 00:39.100
When the man on the television said,...

00:39.650 --> 00:42.700
...the weather was about to get bad.

00:44.600 --> 00:48.150
Well, it had already been raining and snowing for so long.

00:49.100 --> 00:51.550
I didn't even get mad.

00:53.550 --> 00:58.100
Why is everybody always late?

01:02.450 --> 01:05.850
When you asked me for a ride back home,...

01:06.200 --> 01:09.250
...I had already sold my car.

01:11.300 --> 01:14.750
And when you asked me if I needed a ride,...

01:15.100 --> 01:18.300
...I had already walked too far.

01:20.250 --> 01:24.600
Why is everybody always late?

01:29.100 --> 01:32.400
When the quarterback finally threw...

01:32.950 --> 01:35.850
...his very last touchdown pass,...

01:38.050 --> 01:41.450
...the other team had already gone home.

01:41.700 --> 01:45.000
There was nobody left on the grass.

01:46.950 --> 01:51.350
Why is everybody always late?

01:55.750 --> 01:59.050
When Johnny came home to tell his wife,...

01:59.500 --> 02:02.550
...he was sorry for what he had said.

02:04.650 --> 02:08.000
He saw a note sitting on the kitchen table.

02:08.450 --> 02:13.750
A note he had never read and it said, it said,...

02:14.150 --> 02:18.000
..."Why is everybody always late?"

02:22.550 --> 02:23.600
"You're late, Johnny!"
