00:10.500 --> 00:11.700
Have you ever seen...?

00:11.800 --> 00:12.950
Have you ever seen...?

00:13.200 --> 00:15.500
Have you ever seen a day like this?

00:15.700 --> 00:16.700
Have you ever seen...?

00:16.850 --> 00:17.950
Have you ever seen...?

00:18.200 --> 00:20.700
Have you ever seen a day like this?

00:21.100 --> 00:25.050
I saw a day like this 20 years ago.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.100
I have been coming here since I let her go.

00:30.750 --> 00:31.900
Have you ever had...?

00:32.100 --> 00:34.450
Have you ever had a dream like this?

00:34.600 --> 00:35.700
Have you ever had...?

00:35.850 --> 00:36.900
Have you ever had...?

00:37.100 --> 00:39.650
Have you ever had a dream like this?

00:39.950 --> 00:44.100
In my entire life, I have only known...

00:45.000 --> 00:49.150
...only one person whose heart I could call my own.

00:50.100 --> 00:54.100
I have tried many times to find someone new.

00:55.050 --> 00:59.200
So far, I have not found someone to replace you.

01:08.700 --> 01:13.100
On the night we met, that night it was a first and last.

01:13.800 --> 01:18.100
I remember thinking of which question I should ask.

01:18.800 --> 01:23.050
I looked in your eyes as deep as I had ever done.

01:23.850 --> 01:28.050
I remember knowing that for me you were the one.

01:28.100 --> 01:32.900
First question that I asked you when I met you was,...

01:33.300 --> 01:36.500
"Have you ever loved this face before?"

01:38.300 --> 01:42.900
First question that I asked you when I met you was,...

01:43.400 --> 01:47.100
"Have you ever loved this face before?"

01:48.050 --> 01:51.000
And you did not say, "No". You said, "Not yet".

01:51.050 --> 01:54.200
You did not say, "No".

01:55.150 --> 01:56.900
No, no, no, no.

01:58.200 --> 02:01.000
You did not say, "No". You said, "Not yet".

02:01.050 --> 02:04.250
You did not say, "No".

02:08.650 --> 02:13.300
First question that I asked you when I met you was,...

02:13.800 --> 02:17.400
"Have you ever loved this face before?"
