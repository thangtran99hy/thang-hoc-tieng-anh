Hello, ladies.

00:01.130 --> 00:01.700
Look at your man.

00:01.865 --> 00:04.405
Now back to me. Now back at your man. Now back to me.

00:04.835 --> 00:06.155
Sadly, he isn't me.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.360
But if he stopped using lady scented body wash...

00:08.460 --> 00:10.670
...and switched to Old Spice, he could smell like he's me.

00:10.875 --> 00:12.475
Look down. Back up. Where are you?

00:12.710 --> 00:15.445
You're on a boat with the man your man could smell like.

00:15.815 --> 00:17.050
What's in your hand? Back at me.

00:17.315 --> 00:17.715
I have it.

00:17.985 --> 00:20.520
It's an oyster with two tickets to that thing you love.

00:20.755 --> 00:23.155
Look again. The tickets are now diamonds.

00:23.455 --> 00:26.635
Anything is possible when your man smells like Old Spice and not a lady.

00:26.825 --> 00:27.560
I'm on a horse.
