00:02.570 --> 00:04.070
Here's to the crazy ones,...

00:05.505 --> 00:06.240
...the misfits,...

00:06.875 --> 00:07.575
...the rebels,...

00:08.775 --> 00:09.610
...the troublemakers,...

00:10.710 --> 00:12.745
...the round pegs in the square holes,...

00:13.815 --> 00:15.980
...the ones who see things differently.

00:17.150 --> 00:18.550
They're not fond of rules...

00:18.715 --> 00:21.285
...and they have no respect for the status quo.

00:22.790 --> 00:23.760
You can quote them,...

00:24.190 --> 00:25.125
...disagree with them,...

00:25.825 --> 00:27.760
...glorify or vilify them.

00:28.525 --> 00:29.930
But the only thing you can't do...

00:30.595 --> 00:31.495
...is ignore them...

00:32.530 --> 00:34.200
...because they change things.

00:34.800 --> 00:37.705
They push the human race forward.

00:38.670 --> 00:41.775
And while some may see them as the crazy ones,...

00:42.800 --> 00:44.000
...we see genius...

00:46.010 --> 00:47.650
...because the people who are crazy enough...

00:48.115 --> 00:49.780
...to think that they can change the world...

00:51.480 --> 00:52.520
...are the ones who do.
