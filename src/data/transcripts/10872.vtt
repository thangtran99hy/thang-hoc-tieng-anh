00:00.630 --> 00:02.100
After a century of striving,...

00:03.270 --> 00:06.545
...after a year of debate, after a historic vote,...

00:07.600 --> 00:12.010
...health care reform is no longer an unmet promise. It is the law of the land.

00:13.175 --> 00:14.315
It is the law of the land.

00:21.320 --> 00:24.995
And although it may be my signature that's affixed to the bottom of this bill,...

00:25.890 --> 00:28.595
...it was your work, your commitment,...

00:29.460 --> 00:32.700
...your unyielding hope that made this victory possible.

00:33.900 --> 00:36.800
When the special interests deployed an army of lobbyists,...

00:37.770 --> 00:39.975
...an onslaught of negative ads...

00:40.670 --> 00:44.310
...to preserve the status quo. You didn't give up.

00:45.345 --> 00:47.515
You hit the phones and you took to the streets.

00:48.010 --> 00:49.950
You mobilized and you organized.

00:50.180 --> 00:52.885
You turned up the pressure and you kept up the fight.

00:54.455 --> 00:58.025
When the pundits were obsessing over who was up and who was down,...

00:59.790 --> 01:02.930
...you never lost sight of what was right and what was wrong.

01:04.430 --> 01:08.700
You knew this wasn't about the fortunes of a party; this was about the future of our country.

01:18.645 --> 01:21.780
And when the opposition said, this just wasn't the right time,...

01:23.580 --> 01:27.220
...you didn't wanna wait another year or another decade,...

01:27.700 --> 01:32.425
...or another generation for reform. You felt the fierce urgency of now.

01:33.625 --> 01:37.040
You met the lies with truth. You met cynicism with conviction.

01:38.430 --> 01:43.170
Most of all, you met fear with a force that's a lot more powerful...

01:43.400 --> 01:46.470
...and that is faith in America. You met it with hope.
