I'm not quite sure when it started. We know that President Kennedy and President Johnson...

00:08.200 --> 00:11.000
...each used a number of pens when they signed bills.

00:11.100 --> 00:16.310
And the clerk believes that it started with either Truman or Roosevelt.

00:16.750 --> 00:20.620
And the practice that a president uses a number of pens...

00:20.930 --> 00:24.700
...and then gives the pens to people who worked particularly hard on a bill,...

00:24.900 --> 00:27.410
...who sponsored the bill, who really fought to get it done...

00:27.720 --> 00:29.380
...or to whom the bill means a great deal.

00:29.720 --> 00:32.580
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,...

00:32.700 --> 00:35.960
...14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19... No, there's one more.

00:37.760 --> 00:40.200
This is the most pens that we've ever used.

00:40.530 --> 00:41.890
That would be 20 pens today.

00:43.220 --> 00:46.650
He has gotten much better at this. He, in fact, jokes about this actually.

00:47.010 --> 00:48.880
That he is, you know, at the beginning it does not...

00:49.750 --> 00:52.100
...come naturally to use a number of pens when you're signing your name.

00:52.280 --> 00:55.250
And so, but he has now gotten very much in the groove.

00:55.550 --> 00:56.220
I've gotten good at this.

00:58.120 --> 01:01.670
And today would be interesting 'cause these are almost twice as many as he's used before.
