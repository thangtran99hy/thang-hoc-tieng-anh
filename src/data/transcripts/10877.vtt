San Francisco's Japantown is home to some origami masters,...

00:03.805 --> 00:06.270
...including Linda Tomoko Mihara.

00:06.910 --> 00:09.470
Linda is a third-generation Japanese-American.

00:09.750 --> 00:14.900
She is famous for her origami cranes, which once played an important role in Japanese culture.

00:15.280 --> 00:19.430
It was tradition for the bride to fold 1,000 cranes...

00:20.220 --> 00:23.220
...to wish for a long, prosperous marriage, and also to demonstrate...

00:24.460 --> 00:25.690
...I guess her patience.

00:25.960 --> 00:30.760
Linda's grandparents compiled the first origami handbook ever published in the United States.

00:31.160 --> 00:33.630
She began doing origami at the age of five.

00:34.270 --> 00:35.670
She and Lang have worked together.

00:35.900 --> 00:40.420
They once created all the origami models for a 3D animated commercial.

00:45.445 --> 00:49.440
Everything you saw in that commercial, except the car, was origami.

00:50.015 --> 00:54.420
So we did buildings, city buildings, Victorian houses,...

00:55.250 --> 00:57.750
...and even the decorations in the streets around the houses:...

00:58.025 --> 01:01.160
...trash cans, potted plants, and street lamps.

01:01.460 --> 01:06.565
The great response that the commercial got has further spurred the two artists' passion to create.

01:06.900 --> 01:10.670
They are now hoping to one day do the first ever origami movie.
