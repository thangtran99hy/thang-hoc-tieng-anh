00:05.740 --> 00:08.705
A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history...

00:09.640 --> 00:11.945
...when we step out from the old to the new.

00:12.815 --> 00:14.180
When an age ends...

00:14.610 --> 00:17.300
...and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed,...

00:18.005 --> 00:18.850
...finds utterance.

00:20.930 --> 00:23.355
Build courage when courage seems to fail.

00:24.290 --> 00:27.600
Gain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith.

00:28.625 --> 00:29.325
Create hope...

00:29.795 --> 00:31.570
...when hope becomes forlorn.

00:33.135 --> 00:36.195
I never learned how to tune a harp or play upon a lute,...

00:36.665 --> 00:41.640
...but I know how to raise a small and obscure city to glory and greatness...

00:42.040 --> 00:45.225
...whereto all kindred of the Earth will pilgrim.

00:48.080 --> 00:52.450
The great questions of the day will not be settled by means of speeches,...

00:52.650 --> 00:54.070
...which are already decisions,...

00:54.170 --> 00:56.155
...but by iron and blood.

00:58.490 --> 01:01.315
I have witnessed the tremendous energy of the masses.

01:02.285 --> 01:03.330
On this foundation,...

01:03.595 --> 01:07.265
...it is possible to accomplish any task whatsoever.

01:12.140 --> 01:16.945
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
