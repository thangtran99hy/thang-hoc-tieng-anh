You know those fuel guzzling, smoke-spewing modes of transportation we call cars?

00:11.070 --> 00:15.460
Despite threats of climate change, automobiles and trucks aren't going away any time soon.

00:15.910 --> 00:18.820
But some of the pollution caused by these road warriors is.

00:19.970 --> 00:23.520
There's a whole new generation of autos promising carbon free emissions...

00:23.790 --> 00:25.960
...and some of them are even fun to drive.

00:29.790 --> 00:32.840
I think people feel really good about driving a vehicle...

00:33.230 --> 00:35.810
...that is also very socially responsible.

00:35.940 --> 00:37.970
Something that's fun, something that looks good,...

00:38.070 --> 00:39.500
...but something that can make them feel like...

00:39.630 --> 00:41.870
...they're really contributing to making the world a better place.

00:43.220 --> 00:44.670
This is the Tesla Roadster,...

00:44.890 --> 00:48.510
...an all - electric vehicle that can go more than 400 kilometers on a charge.

00:48.690 --> 00:50.950
The car is made out of carbon fiber.

00:51.180 --> 00:53.200
That's very unique to this particular vehicle.

00:53.350 --> 00:57.030
It makes the vehicle very light which helps out with the performance.

00:57.670 --> 01:00.490
The Tesla is named after inventor Nikola Tesla,...

01:00.790 --> 01:03.230
...one of the early pioneers of electrical power.

01:03.860 --> 01:05.560
The Tesla is a great-looking car...

01:05.720 --> 01:10.000
...and despite its size, it has ample storage for a weekend getaway, or...

01:10.150 --> 01:12.440
You have enough storage space here to fit actually...

01:12.570 --> 01:15.070
...two golf bags, one on top of the other, so...

01:16.020 --> 01:20.380
...you can absolutely fit weekend bags and travel with this vehicle for the weekend.

01:21.310 --> 01:23.810
...more importantly, at least to race car fans,...

01:23.960 --> 01:28.320
...the Tesla Roadster has all the torque of a 500 horsepower Corvette.

01:28.580 --> 01:32.020
And the Tesla can go from zero to 100 kilometers per hour...

01:32.220 --> 01:33.860
...in less than four seconds.

01:34.190 --> 01:36.010
By any measure, that's fast.

01:36.070 --> 01:38.130
The hardest thing is to not get a speeding ticket.

01:38.290 --> 01:40.040
The Roadster has its drawbacks though,...

01:40.320 --> 01:43.750
...namely the price: more than 100,000 US dollars.

01:44.130 --> 01:48.570
But in 2011, Tesla Motors will offer a roomier, more family friendly car...

01:48.810 --> 01:49.830
...at half the price.
