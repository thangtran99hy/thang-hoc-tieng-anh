Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:04.200 --> 00:05.300
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:05.900 --> 00:08.950
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:10.200 --> 00:11.200
Today's Maestro Hook.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.750
Maestro Hook is a small conversation hook that you can use with foreigners...

00:15.950 --> 00:17.550
...to kind of get a good conversation going.

00:18.550 --> 00:20.850
So, please use this with a foreigner when you're talking to them.

00:21.850 --> 00:23.900
Today's topic is mistaken identity.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.400
Western people are basically very friendly people.

00:27.650 --> 00:29.550
So, even on the streets,...

00:29.850 --> 00:31.750
...when they see someone that they think they know,...

00:31.850 --> 00:33.300
...they'll definitely come up and talk to them.

00:34.450 --> 00:37.050
Because of that, a lot of times, they make a mistake,...

00:37.150 --> 00:38.100
...they get the wrong person.

00:39.100 --> 00:40.900
So, when a foreigner comes up and talks to you...

00:41.300 --> 00:42.250
...and you don't know who they are...

00:43.100 --> 00:45.600
...just tell them, "You've got the wrong person", okay?

00:49.600 --> 00:51.550
Okay. Today's Maestro Menu...

01:05.100 --> 01:06.300
You've got the wrong person.

01:07.300 --> 01:08.550
You've got the wrong person.

01:20.550 --> 01:21.800
You've got the wrong person.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.200
I took you for someone else.

01:31.600 --> 01:32.850
I took you for someone else.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.300
Oh! I took you for someone else.

01:45.050 --> 01:46.650
Okay. Maestro Lines.

01:50.050 --> 01:51.200
Excuse me, are you John?

01:52.350 --> 01:54.150
Oh! You've got the wrong person.

01:55.100 --> 01:57.600
Oh I'm sorry, I took you for someone else.

02:00.450 --> 02:02.050
Okay, that's it for today.

02:03.100 --> 02:05.950
Now next week, there'll be more contents for you to enjoy...

02:06.100 --> 02:08.450
...to become the native maestro. So, please watch.

02:08.850 --> 02:10.100
And I'll see you next week!

02:10.900 --> 02:11.300
Bye-bye!
