What's the most resilient parasite?

00:05.070 --> 00:05.835
An idea.

00:10.575 --> 00:12.745
A single idea from the human mind...

00:13.950 --> 00:15.280
...can build cities.

00:20.655 --> 00:23.425
An idea can transform the world...

00:24.290 --> 00:26.025
...and rewrite all the rules,...

00:28.295 --> 00:28.965
...which is why...

00:31.430 --> 00:32.735
...I have to steal it.

00:35.185 --> 00:38.535
Never recreate from your memory. Always imagine new places.

00:42.350 --> 00:45.145
He's hiding something and we need to find out what that is.

00:48.745 --> 00:49.595
We gotta break outta here.

00:50.350 --> 00:50.875
Give him the kick.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.600
This was not part of the plan!

00:59.025 --> 00:59.795
Wake me up!

01:00.555 --> 01:01.325
Wake me up!
