Isabella Swan,...

00:11.200 --> 00:14.250
...I promise to love you every moment, forever.

00:20.250 --> 00:21.200
She's still human.

00:22.250 --> 00:24.400
The Volturi don't give second chances.

00:26.900 --> 00:28.800
Why are you so against me in becoming like you?

00:29.850 --> 00:32.750
I know the consequences of the choice you're making.

00:33.650 --> 00:36.350
After a few decades, everyone you know will be dead.

00:38.350 --> 00:40.400
You wouldn't have to change for me, Bella.

00:40.750 --> 00:43.800
I'm in love with you and I want you to pick me instead of him.

00:46.550 --> 00:48.400
You have to consider the idea...

00:48.550 --> 00:50.550
...that I might be better for her than you are.

00:55.500 --> 00:55.950
Edward,...

00:58.250 --> 00:59.050
...she found us.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.700
I will protect you no matter what.

01:12.450 --> 01:14.350
You don't know what you're getting yourself into.

01:15.600 --> 01:18.600
I'm gonna fight for you until your heart stops beating.
