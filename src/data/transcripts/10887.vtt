So, imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in America...

00:19.955 --> 00:21.970
...and a Japanese man comes up to you and says,...

00:22.250 --> 00:24.190
"Excuse me, what is the name of this block?"

00:24.855 --> 00:27.860
You say, "I'm sorry. Well this is Oak Street, that's Elm Street,...

00:28.260 --> 00:29.760
...this is 26th, that's 27th."

00:30.265 --> 00:32.425
He says, "OK. But what is the name of that block?"

00:32.930 --> 00:35.035
"You see, well, blocks don't have names."

00:35.435 --> 00:39.675
"Streets have names. Blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets."

00:40.375 --> 00:42.310
He leaves a little confused and disappointed.

00:43.310 --> 00:45.810
So now imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in Japan.

00:45.970 --> 00:47.545
You turn to a person next to you and say,...

00:48.045 --> 00:50.050
"Excuse me, what is the name of this street?"

00:50.550 --> 00:53.575
And they say, "Oh well, that's Block 17 and this is Block 16."

00:54.220 --> 00:57.090
And you say, "OK. But what is the name of this street?"

00:57.525 --> 00:59.690
They say, "Well, streets don't have names."

00:59.895 --> 01:00.900
"Blocks have names."

01:01.160 --> 01:04.990
"Just look at Google Maps here. There's Block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19."

01:05.765 --> 01:07.200
"All of these blocks have names."

01:07.600 --> 01:10.535
"The streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks."

01:11.405 --> 01:13.975
And you say, "OK, then how do you know your home address?"

01:14.305 --> 01:17.200
He said, "Well, easy. This is District Eight,...

01:17.810 --> 01:20.280
...there's Block 17, house number one."

01:20.745 --> 01:21.200
You say, "OK,...

01:21.250 --> 01:22.309
"...but walking around the neighborhood,..."

01:22.385 --> 01:24.143
"...I noticed that the house numbers don't go in order."

01:24.485 --> 01:26.985
He said, "Of course they do. They go in the order in which they were built."

01:27.475 --> 01:30.455
"The first house ever built on a block is house number one."

01:30.790 --> 01:32.795
"The second house ever built is house number two."

01:33.090 --> 01:35.095
"Third is house number three. It's easy. It's obvious."

01:35.995 --> 01:40.130
So, I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world...

01:40.300 --> 01:42.540
...to realize assumptions we didn't even know we had,...

01:42.835 --> 01:45.135
...and realize that the opposite of them may also be true.

01:45.705 --> 01:47.085
And this map is also accurate.

01:49.575 --> 01:52.580
There's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India,...

01:52.745 --> 01:54.115
...the opposite is also true.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.560
So let's never forget, whether at TED or anywhere else,...

01:56.660 --> 01:59.550
...that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear,...

01:59.780 --> 02:01.385
...that the opposite may also be true.
