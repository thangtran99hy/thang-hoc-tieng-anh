00:07.535 --> 00:09.500
What is it that you love about dance?

00:12.785 --> 00:14.630
Everything you need to know is in my dancing.

00:15.900 --> 00:16.365
Everything?

00:24.400 --> 00:25.435
What you saw before...

00:25.660 --> 00:26.480
...is just the beginning.

00:29.100 --> 00:29.980
Welcome to my house.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.995
Think of the House as like a super crew.

00:36.865 --> 00:38.640
Dancers work together, live together,...

00:39.000 --> 00:39.690
...and battle together.

00:40.415 --> 00:41.100
It's crazy, right?

00:42.610 --> 00:43.965
This place is incredible!

00:46.935 --> 00:48.700
Check this. It's the biggest battle ever.

00:51.070 --> 00:52.030
You up for a little competition?

00:52.650 --> 00:53.480
I never lose.

01:06.735 --> 01:08.010
Some people learn to dance.

01:09.060 --> 01:09.800
Others are born to.

01:11.420 --> 01:13.560
People dance because dance can change things.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.160
One move can bring people together.

01:17.300 --> 01:18.230
One move...

01:19.780 --> 01:21.560
...can make you believe like you're something more.

01:23.000 --> 01:23.760
One move...

01:24.760 --> 01:26.660
...can set a whole generation free.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.500
We should get to rehearsal.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.420
Oh, that's so sick!
