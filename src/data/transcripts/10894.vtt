In Africa, there's another use for mobile phones.

00:03.970 --> 00:05.900
Public health workers in Kenya...

00:06.140 --> 00:11.330
...are using mobile phones to gather health information from patients in remote areas...

00:11.575 --> 00:13.270
...and upload it to the Internet...

00:13.480 --> 00:16.210
...for instant analysis at distant centers.

00:16.515 --> 00:19.725
And it's all happening thanks to Dr. Joel Selanikio.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.355
You can really make a difference...

00:21.685 --> 00:25.375
...using, again, just common modern information technologies.

00:25.860 --> 00:28.480
Dr. Selanikio first noticed the need...

00:28.680 --> 00:32.000
...to better use information technology for health care...

00:32.395 --> 00:35.440
...while working as a disease outbreak investigator...

00:35.710 --> 00:38.870
...for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.840
Kinda take the first steps toward using...

00:41.245 --> 00:46.080
...things like pocket computers and PDAs for doing fieldwork.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.355
Dr. Selanikio left his position five years ago...

00:50.650 --> 00:54.700
...to cofound DataDyne.org with partner Rose Donna...

00:55.020 --> 00:56.955
...as a nonprofit organization...

00:57.255 --> 01:02.285
...dedicated to providing sustainable information technologies in poor areas.

01:02.660 --> 01:06.160
And with financial support from the United Nations Foundation,...

01:06.460 --> 01:08.240
...and the Vodafone Foundation,...

01:08.460 --> 01:11.185
...Dr. Selanikio developed EpiSurveyor.

01:11.605 --> 01:16.050
A free, mobile, web-based and open-source data collection tool...

01:16.445 --> 01:18.840
...that is transforming the way public health...

01:19.075 --> 01:22.045
...is practiced in underserved areas of the world.
