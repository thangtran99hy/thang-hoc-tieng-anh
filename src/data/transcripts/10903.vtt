00:16.015 --> 00:17.350
The war rages on.

00:22.185 --> 00:24.620
We have dealt the enemy many crushing blows.

00:29.095 --> 00:30.760
We have exposed their positions...

00:31.330 --> 00:32.280
...and driven them back.

00:36.510 --> 00:37.510
But they have endured.

00:41.470 --> 00:42.270
They have adapted.

00:46.610 --> 00:49.040
And they are not as weak as we once thought.

00:51.950 --> 00:53.590
War requires the sledgehammer...

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
...but will be decided with a scalpel.

00:57.590 --> 00:59.790
A different breed of warrior is required.

01:04.930 --> 01:07.430
We are experts in the application of violence.

01:11.300 --> 01:12.930
We possess the mindset and will...

01:13.380 --> 01:14.810
...to do what is necessary.

01:19.710 --> 01:20.110
We...

01:20.910 --> 01:21.630
...are Tier 1.

01:31.990 --> 01:33.610
Man, they really worked him over.

01:34.560 --> 01:35.390
Think he's gonna make it?

01:36.395 --> 01:36.960
Get down!
