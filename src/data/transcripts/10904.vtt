Legend tells of a band of noble warriors...

00:10.575 --> 00:13.410
...known as the Guardians of Ga'Hoole.

00:15.650 --> 00:17.620
Whenever trouble is at hand,...

00:18.485 --> 00:19.650
...seek them out...

00:20.690 --> 00:23.620
...for they are sworn to protect the innocent...

00:24.425 --> 00:26.160
...and vanquish evil.

00:27.260 --> 00:28.390
Should I stop?

00:28.520 --> 00:29.450
No, move on.

00:29.550 --> 00:29.860
No?

00:30.220 --> 00:31.440
This is my favorite part.

00:34.750 --> 00:36.200
Soren, what happened next?

00:36.300 --> 00:38.150
Then, Twilight strikes the final blow.

00:38.270 --> 00:39.130
The Guardians win,...

00:40.240 --> 00:41.070
...and they go home.

00:41.180 --> 00:41.550
The end.

00:41.650 --> 00:42.900
Think about something real.

00:43.000 --> 00:43.440
They're real.

00:54.520 --> 00:55.520
I picture myself...

00:55.750 --> 00:59.020
...standing on a great cliff with the Guardians ready for battle.

00:59.390 --> 01:00.420
Come on, I'll race ya!

01:13.540 --> 01:14.340
What's goin' on?

01:15.010 --> 01:16.740
We need to find the Guardians.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.740
They're the only ones who can save us.

01:18.845 --> 01:20.200
We're each other's family now.

01:20.520 --> 01:21.410
We'll find them together.

01:23.050 --> 01:27.980
When you've flown as far as you can, you're halfway there.

01:28.120 --> 01:28.820
What did he say?

01:29.050 --> 01:30.820
We're halfway there!

01:53.280 --> 01:56.990
You too can be a great Guardian one day.
