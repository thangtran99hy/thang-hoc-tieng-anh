00:01.135 --> 00:05.400
In the ornate Spanish hall, the two countries agreed to downsize their arsenals.

00:05.800 --> 00:10.650
Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev signed their country's first major nuclear arms pact...

00:10.780 --> 00:12.150
...in almost two decades.

00:12.580 --> 00:16.080
Mr. Obama said the treaty is a big step forward for world security.

00:16.380 --> 00:20.110
Today's an important milestone for nuclear security and nonproliferation,...

00:20.550 --> 00:23.220
...and for U.S.-Russia relations.

00:23.550 --> 00:27.780
Speaking through an interpreter, the Russian leader said the yearlong negotiations were tough...

00:27.990 --> 00:30.390
...but hard work on both sides brought success.

00:30.960 --> 00:34.830
That enabled us to do something, that in just a couple of months,...

00:35.800 --> 00:37.570
...looked like mission impossible.

00:37.760 --> 00:42.530
Within a short span of time, we prepared a full-fledged treaty and signed it.

00:42.740 --> 00:46.710
The pact requires the US and Russia to cut their inventory of nuclear warheads...

00:46.850 --> 00:49.260
...by about 1/3 in the next seven years.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.800
The agreement also slashes by more than half the number of missiles,...

00:52.920 --> 00:55.190
...submarines and bombers that carry the weapons.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.140
Mr. Obama says in addition,...

00:57.240 --> 01:00.640
...the treaty paves the way for future arms reduction talks with Russia...

01:00.960 --> 01:03.060
...mainly on short-range nuclear weapons.

01:03.160 --> 01:05.890
This treaty will set the stage for further cuts.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.520
And going forward, we hope to pursue discussions with Russia...

01:09.900 --> 01:13.000
...on reducing both our strategic and tactical weapons,...

01:13.200 --> 01:14.975
...including non-deployed weapons.
