Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:04.250 --> 00:05.300
I'm your maitre d', Seita.

00:05.650 --> 00:08.700
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:09.900 --> 00:12.200
Now, today's Maestro Hook.

00:12.650 --> 00:16.200
Now remember, a Hook is a good conversation piece that you can use with a foreigner...

00:16.650 --> 00:18.100
...when you don't have anything good to talk about...

00:18.150 --> 00:19.800
...or you need a good conversation piece.

00:20.250 --> 00:21.850
So today's Hook is...

00:22.450 --> 00:23.600
...where to take a foreigner...

00:24.100 --> 00:27.400
...when you're the tour guide and they wanna see the real Japan,...

00:28.250 --> 00:29.350
...the real Tokyo more like.

00:29.950 --> 00:33.150
Well, I think the best way to do it is to show them like...

00:33.300 --> 00:37.650
...the grand metropolis of Japan, like the buildings and like the big city areas.

00:38.750 --> 00:42.400
And also show them the very traditional side of Japan like...

00:42.700 --> 00:45.450
...gardens and cherry blossoms, and temples and shrines.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.250
So that two big dichotomy is what makes Japan really, really eccentric.

00:52.100 --> 00:53.400
Alright, so.

01:12.700 --> 01:13.750
Some view.

01:15.650 --> 01:16.300
Some place.

01:18.000 --> 01:18.600
Some guy.

01:21.100 --> 01:23.850
Wow! That restaurant is a great place.

01:23.900 --> 01:24.800
It's some dinner.

01:32.750 --> 01:33.350
Great!

01:36.050 --> 01:37.050
It's quite amazing!

01:41.600 --> 01:43.150
I hear it's quite amazing.

01:53.650 --> 01:56.650
Alright. So, Maestro Lines.

01:58.800 --> 02:02.850
Yeah, there's a lot of great cherry blossoms in Japan...

02:02.900 --> 02:04.450
...and when it's the season, it blooms.

02:04.850 --> 02:05.750
It's some view.

02:07.050 --> 02:09.950
The city view from a big building is great.

02:10.200 --> 02:11.400
It's some scenery.

02:13.450 --> 02:16.750
Or, that restaurant is quite amazing.

02:16.900 --> 02:18.050
You gotta go visit.

02:18.900 --> 02:23.700
Or, in April, it's the best time to come to Japan and you can see cherry blossoms...

02:23.850 --> 02:25.500
...and you can see a great scenery.

02:25.850 --> 02:26.750
It's quite amazing.

02:29.900 --> 02:32.750
Alright. That's it for today and hope you liked it.

02:32.800 --> 02:36.450
And next week there'll be more contents to help you become the native maestro.

02:36.950 --> 02:37.700
See you later!
