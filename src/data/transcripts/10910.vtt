Welcome to AERA English's Native Maestro.

00:03.350 --> 00:04.500
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:04.850 --> 00:07.700
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:08.850 --> 00:10.200
Today's Maestro Hook.

00:10.950 --> 00:13.650
The Hook is a good conversation piece you can use with a foreigner...

00:14.150 --> 00:15.400
...to get a good conversation going.

00:16.450 --> 00:19.750
Today, I wanna talk about what I've experienced with Japanese people...

00:20.100 --> 00:21.700
...in a meeting or in a class.

00:22.450 --> 00:25.200
When I'm doing a meeting or in a class, I ask everyone,...

00:25.600 --> 00:27.050
..."Does anybody have any questions?"...

00:27.850 --> 00:29.650
...and then, nobody answers.

00:30.300 --> 00:33.700
I think in Japan, by not answering, you're expressing that you have,...

00:33.850 --> 00:35.450
..."No, I don't have any questions."

00:35.850 --> 00:38.550
But in Western culture, it's more like you're ignoring them.

00:38.650 --> 00:39.600
It's a little bit rude.

00:39.900 --> 00:41.650
So when I say, "Do you have any questions?"

00:42.100 --> 00:43.800
Maybe you should say, "No",...

00:44.550 --> 00:45.900
...or, "Not so far",...

00:46.500 --> 00:47.550
...or, "I'm good".

00:48.250 --> 00:50.300
And this is a good way to have a communication...

00:50.350 --> 00:52.300
...even during a meeting or inside a classroom.

00:52.550 --> 00:54.150
So, please keep that in mind.

00:54.900 --> 00:57.050
Okay. And today's Maestro Menu.

01:16.450 --> 01:18.800
Give me a minute.

01:20.050 --> 01:20.900
Give me a minute.

01:27.800 --> 01:28.600
Give me a minute.

01:38.600 --> 01:39.300
And the next one.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.900
That's a tough one.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.200
Oh, that's a tough one.

01:54.650 --> 01:55.400
Let me think.

02:03.100 --> 02:04.150
Yeah, that's a tough one.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.200
Yeah, give me a minute.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.450
So, Maestro Lines.

02:12.250 --> 02:13.750
What do you think of today's project?

02:14.550 --> 02:16.000
Will you think of any good solutions?

02:17.700 --> 02:19.250
Give me a minute, let me think.

02:23.550 --> 02:24.750
How do you feel about that?

02:26.300 --> 02:27.300
That's a tough one.

02:28.550 --> 02:29.400
Give me a minute.

02:37.000 --> 02:37.400
Alright?

02:37.650 --> 02:41.800
So, a good English in a business situation always on Native Maestro.

02:42.250 --> 02:44.750
See you next week and enjoy English.

02:45.000 --> 02:45.400
Bye-bye!
