Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:03.900 --> 00:05.100
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:05.150 --> 00:08.150
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.950
Alright. Today's Maestro Hook.

00:11.650 --> 00:14.800
A Hook is a good conversation piece you can use when you're talking with a foreigner,...

00:15.100 --> 00:16.150
...when you run out of topics...

00:16.200 --> 00:18.550
...or you need a good topic to make the conversation better.

00:19.300 --> 00:20.850
Today, we're gonna talk about the word...

00:24.000 --> 00:25.350
..."sportsmanship" in English.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.500
We don't really use that word.

00:26.550 --> 00:27.600
It's kind of a strange word.

00:28.500 --> 00:33.150
Of course, we have that culture but in English it's called more the "one-upmanship".

00:34.000 --> 00:37.750
One-upmanship means you go one-up than another person.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.850
So, you want to one-up somebody,...

00:40.200 --> 00:42.350
...whether in a game of tennis, you wanna win,...

00:42.450 --> 00:43.250
...it's one-upmanship.

00:43.750 --> 00:46.600
Or, when you're having a conversation and you wanna point something out,...

00:46.900 --> 00:48.350
...and be better than that person,..

00:48.550 --> 00:49.700
...it's all one-upmanship.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.150
It's important in Western culture to have this...

00:53.350 --> 00:55.500
...because you always wanna be better than everybody.

00:55.700 --> 00:57.100
It's a very aggressive attitude...

00:57.350 --> 00:58.250
...and it's the one-upmanship.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.100
Okay, so English is connected to that.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.400
You got me there.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.250
Oh! You got me there.

01:27.150 --> 01:28.800
Oh! You got me there.

01:31.600 --> 01:32.000
Okay.

01:39.100 --> 01:39.800
You showed him.

01:42.150 --> 01:43.050
I showed you.

01:46.950 --> 01:47.650
I showed him.

01:47.950 --> 01:49.350
Yeah, you really showed him.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.100
So, Maestro Lines.

02:01.850 --> 02:03.900
I beat you in that game of tennis, didn't I?

02:04.400 --> 02:05.900
Oh, you're right! You got me there.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.650
Yeah, you're a better player than me.

02:11.600 --> 02:14.300
Yeah, in that meeting, you really said what you wanted to.

02:14.700 --> 02:16.000
Yeah, he didn't know what to say.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.550
You really showed him.

02:20.950 --> 02:25.200
So, this is a really important spirit in American culture, the one-upmanship.

02:25.650 --> 02:29.050
It's a casual word but you can use it a lot in very good conversations.

02:29.100 --> 02:32.650
So, please learn the one-upmanship like sportsmanship,...

02:33.150 --> 02:33.550
...okay?

02:34.250 --> 02:36.150
That's it for today and I hope you liked it.

02:36.250 --> 02:38.450
And next week, there's more stuff that you can learn,...

02:38.700 --> 02:42.100
...culture, and words that you can use to become a native maestro.

02:42.750 --> 02:44.950
Alright, thanks a lot and see you later!
