00:01.026 --> 00:02.450
What's up with chicken sandwiches?

00:02.579 --> 00:03.191
Big bun.

00:03.385 --> 00:03.951
Puny chicken.

00:04.145 --> 00:05.517
It takes two to fill me up.

00:05.654 --> 00:06.571
Give me more chicken!

00:07.909 --> 00:08.383
Finally!

00:08.525 --> 00:09.496
Hello chicken!

00:09.680 --> 00:10.367
Someone was listening.

00:10.498 --> 00:11.353
It's got two of everything:...

00:11.547 --> 00:13.454
...two pieces of cheese, two pieces of bacon,...

00:13.666 --> 00:15.050
...and two pieces of chicken.

00:15.341 --> 00:16.336
So long, bun!

00:16.537 --> 00:17.169
Mmmhmm!

00:17.493 --> 00:19.087
Now, this is a chicken sandwich.

00:19.243 --> 00:21.023
The new KFC Double Down Chicken Sandwich.

00:21.268 --> 00:24.175
So much 100% premium chicken, we didn't have room for a bun.

00:24.371 --> 00:25.774
Try it in Original Recipe or grilled.

00:25.897 --> 00:27.293
Hey Colonel, you the man!

00:27.417 --> 00:29.927
Unthink and taste the unhungry side of KFC.
