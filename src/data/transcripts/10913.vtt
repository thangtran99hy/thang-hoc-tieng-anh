Please tell me what inspired you to write this book.

00:04.950 --> 00:07.400
Well, I always loved math in school.

00:08.100 --> 00:11.750
And when I graduated with a degree in mathematics,...

00:12.100 --> 00:17.350
...I noticed how many people were so shocked and stunned...

00:17.600 --> 00:18.800
...that I had gone into math.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.000
They said, "But you're an actress."

00:21.400 --> 00:22.600
"Why are you studying math?"

00:23.200 --> 00:24.800
"You know, math is for nerds."

00:25.500 --> 00:27.350
I was so horrified.

00:27.700 --> 00:32.550
And I noticed so many women especially saying, "Oh, I can't do math."

00:32.850 --> 00:34.100
"I was never good at math."

00:34.400 --> 00:35.950
And I wanted to show them...

00:36.300 --> 00:41.150
...that you don't have to be a certain kind of person to love math...

00:41.400 --> 00:42.700
...and to do well at math.

00:43.100 --> 00:46.600
So, I wanted to help girls embrace the idea of being smart.

00:46.800 --> 00:50.000
And embrace the idea that they could be smart with math.

00:50.250 --> 00:53.050
And they could be fabulous and popular and anything else they wanna be.

00:53.100 --> 00:54.500
They can be anybody they want,...

00:54.800 --> 00:57.550
...and studying math and being smart makes it better.
