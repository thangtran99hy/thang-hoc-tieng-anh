Hi! My name is Danica McKellar.

00:02.200 --> 00:05.250
I'm the author of this math book called "Math Doesn't Suck"...

00:05.700 --> 00:07.450
...to help middle school girls with math.

00:07.950 --> 00:11.800
And I'd like to tell you how to pronounce some numbers in English.

00:13.350 --> 00:15.000
525...

00:15.300 --> 00:18.050
...times 10,056...

00:18.450 --> 00:19.200
...equals...

00:19.600 --> 00:23.700
...5,279,400.

00:24.800 --> 00:25.800
Now, some fractions.

00:26.450 --> 00:27.450
2/3...

00:27.550 --> 00:29.550
...times 4/5...

00:29.800 --> 00:32.050
...equals 8/15.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.150
1 3/7...

00:35.550 --> 00:37.200
...times 1/3...

00:37.500 --> 00:39.900
...equals 10/21.

00:41.550 --> 00:43.100
5,010...

00:43.550 --> 00:45.700
...divided by 200...

00:46.100 --> 00:49.500
...equals 25.05.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.650
5.05...

00:52.950 --> 00:56.800
...times 7.009...

00:57.150 --> 01:02.150
...equals 35.39545.

01:03.300 --> 01:04.400
Some more fractions.

01:05.100 --> 01:08.400
4/8 is greater than 3/8...

01:09.200 --> 01:14.050
...and 15/24 is less than 16/24.

01:14.350 --> 01:15.550
I hope this has been helpful.

01:16.650 --> 01:17.200
Thank you.
