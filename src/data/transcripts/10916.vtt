Hello! Welcome to Michael's Business Top Tips.

00:03.400 --> 00:06.100
This month, we're looking at innovation for you.

00:07.140 --> 00:09.800
How can you add innovation to your business?

00:10.510 --> 00:13.880
Now, many people confuse innovation with invention.

00:14.430 --> 00:15.950
Invention is much tougher.

00:16.280 --> 00:20.530
That's coming up with some new, original product or technology or idea.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.450
Innovation, in a way, is much easier.

00:24.090 --> 00:26.150
It's looking at what is existing now...

00:26.490 --> 00:29.630
...and how can we do it differently to make it better.

00:31.160 --> 00:35.130
Two famous examples of this, Apple and Procter & Gamble.

00:35.970 --> 00:36.840
First, Apple.

00:37.370 --> 00:41.450
Apple is famous as one of the world's leading innovation companies.

00:42.040 --> 00:45.640
And what they do is they take existing technology and ideas,...

00:45.980 --> 00:47.210
...and make them better.

00:47.980 --> 00:51.250
For example, the MP3 player, they made the iPod.

00:51.920 --> 00:53.740
The mobile phone, they made the iPhone.

00:54.390 --> 00:57.590
And now with e-readers, they're making the iPad.

00:58.390 --> 01:01.290
All these ideas and technology existed before.

01:01.690 --> 01:03.830
But they're taking a new way of doing it.

01:04.660 --> 01:06.930
So think about this within your own business.

01:07.360 --> 01:10.230
What could you do differently to make it better?

01:10.900 --> 01:12.500
This could be product or service,...

01:12.740 --> 01:14.800
...or just your daily routine work.

01:16.120 --> 01:17.870
Second, Procter & Gamble.

01:18.640 --> 01:21.880
Procter & Gamble took a new approach to R&D.

01:22.380 --> 01:25.650
...by finding ideas for new products and drugs...

01:26.080 --> 01:29.960
...outside their company, around the world, through the Internet.

01:30.690 --> 01:35.500
By looking outside, they got a lot of new, original, innovative ideas.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.160
Also, you can do this:...

01:38.560 --> 01:40.160
...look outside your business.

01:40.500 --> 01:43.300
Where can you get new ideas to change what you do?

01:43.970 --> 01:46.570
One good resource is TED.com.

01:46.840 --> 01:47.800
T E D.

01:48.540 --> 01:51.170
This site is dedicated to spreading ideas...

01:51.510 --> 01:54.610
...of new innovations in business around the world.

01:55.280 --> 01:55.910
Check it out!

01:56.680 --> 01:58.010
OK! That's it for today.

01:58.280 --> 02:01.850
Remember, all of us must and should be innovators.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.390
Thank you very much!
