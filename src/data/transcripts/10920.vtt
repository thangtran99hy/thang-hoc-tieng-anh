Well, he makes me laugh. That's one thing.

00:09.200 --> 00:11.850
He makes me comfortable.

00:11.950 --> 00:14.600
Usually, I'm a very tense, nervous actor.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.900
And he has his way with great care,...

00:17.450 --> 00:19.400
...and I like that.

00:19.900 --> 00:23.850
And we both share a very gloomy view of the world...

00:24.950 --> 00:26.950
...which is strange since we both work in comedy.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.575
But we're both obsessed with death and dying.

00:30.625 --> 00:33.850
And he is always calling me in the middle of the night,...

00:36.050 --> 00:39.600
...worried about his health, and he thinks he's gonna die.

00:39.950 --> 00:41.200
He's a very, very gloomy man...

00:41.550 --> 00:42.600
...and I like him for that.
