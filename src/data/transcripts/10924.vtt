00:01.350 --> 00:03.200
But my idea of success is different today.

00:03.250 --> 00:05.850
And as you grow, you'll realize the definition of success changes.

00:05.900 --> 00:10.250
For many of you today, success is being able to hold down 20 shots of tequila.

00:12.700 --> 00:16.900
For me, the most important thing in your life is to live your life with integrity...

00:17.000 --> 00:20.100
...and not to give in to peer pressure to try to be something that you're not,...

00:20.500 --> 00:23.400
...to live your life as an honest and compassionate person,...

00:23.450 --> 00:24.700
...to contribute in some way.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.150
So to conclude my conclusion,...

00:28.800 --> 00:30.950
...follow your passion, stay true to yourself,...

00:31.000 --> 00:32.400
...never follow someone else's path,...

00:32.450 --> 00:34.350
...unless you're in the woods and you're lost and you see a path,...

00:34.400 --> 00:35.800
...then by all means you should follow that.

00:40.650 --> 00:42.800
Don't give advice. It'll come back and bite you in the ass.

00:42.850 --> 00:44.250
Don't take anyone's advice.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.550
So my advice to you is to...

00:48.150 --> 00:50.700
...be true to yourself and everything will be fine.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.650
And I know that a lot of you are concerned about your future,...

00:52.700 --> 00:53.650
...but there's no need to worry.

00:53.700 --> 00:54.900
The economy is booming,...

00:55.050 --> 00:56.600
...the job market is wide open,...

00:57.950 --> 00:59.450
...the planet is just fine.

01:01.100 --> 01:01.600
It's gonna be great.

01:01.650 --> 01:02.800
You've already survived a hurricane.

01:02.850 --> 01:03.700
What else can happen to you?

01:03.800 --> 01:04.750
And as I mentioned before,...

01:04.800 --> 01:07.350
...some of the most devastating things that happen to you will teach you the most.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.670
And now you know the right questions to ask for your first job interview.

01:10.750 --> 01:12.000
Like, "Is it above sea level?"

01:16.450 --> 01:19.400
So to conclude my conclusion that I've previously concluded...

01:19.500 --> 01:21.100
...in the common cement speech,...

01:21.500 --> 01:24.600
...I guess what I'm trying to say is life is like one big Mardi Gras.

01:25.150 --> 01:27.500
But instead of showing your boobs, show people your brain.

01:28.100 --> 01:29.350
And if they like what they see,...

01:29.400 --> 01:31.500
...you'll have more beads than you know what to do with.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.200
And you'll be drunk most of the time.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.300
So to the "Katrina Class" of 2009,...

01:37.350 --> 01:41.100
...I say congratulations! And if you don't remember a thing I said today, remember this:...

01:41.350 --> 01:42.450
...you're gonna be OK.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Just dance.
