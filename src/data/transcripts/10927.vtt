00:01.250 --> 00:06.700
Last August, I was told that in all likelihood, I had three to six months left to live.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.000
I'm on month nine now.

00:10.550 --> 00:12.650
And I'm not gonna get down and do any push-ups,...

00:27.750 --> 00:30.000
...but there will be a short pick-up basketball game later.

00:32.850 --> 00:35.450
Somebody said to me in light of these numbers,...

00:35.900 --> 00:38.400
"Wow! So, you're really beating the Grim Reaper."

00:40.150 --> 00:42.200
And what I said without even thinking about it is,...

00:42.650 --> 00:46.000
"We don't beat the Reaper by living longer."

00:47.200 --> 00:50.000
"We beat the Reaper by living well,...

00:50.800 --> 00:51.750
...and living fully."

00:52.400 --> 00:54.950
For the Reaper will come for all of us.

00:55.300 --> 00:56.000
The question is,...

00:56.050 --> 01:00.700
...what do we do between the time we're born and the time he shows up?

01:01.400 --> 01:05.100
'Cause when he shows up, it's too late to do all the things...

01:05.700 --> 01:08.200
...that you're always gonna kind of get around to.

01:09.150 --> 01:12.100
So, I think the only advice I can give you...

01:12.150 --> 01:13.650
...on how to live your life well...

01:14.700 --> 01:16.050
...is first off, remember,...

01:16.600 --> 01:18.900
...it's a cliche but I love cliches,...

01:19.700 --> 01:24.550
..."It is not the things we do in life that we regret on our deathbed,...

01:25.100 --> 01:26.850
...it is the things we do not."

01:27.650 --> 01:30.900
'Cause I assure you I've done a lot of really stupid things,...

01:32.400 --> 01:34.500
...and none of them bother me.

01:34.600 --> 01:36.050
All the mistakes,...

01:36.500 --> 01:38.200
...and all the dopey things,...

01:38.650 --> 01:40.250
...and all the times I was embarrassed,...

01:40.650 --> 01:41.500
...they don't matter.

01:42.150 --> 01:45.750
What matters is that I can kinda look back and say,...

01:46.300 --> 01:48.900
"Pretty much anytime I got a chance to do something cool,...

01:49.250 --> 01:50.500
...I tried to grab for it."

01:51.500 --> 01:53.300
And that's where my solace comes from.
