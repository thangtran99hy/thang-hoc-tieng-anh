00:05.150 --> 00:07.150
I always wondered why nobody did it before me.

00:07.450 --> 00:10.700
I mean, all those comic books, movies, TV shows,...

00:11.750 --> 00:14.300
...you'd think that one eccentric loner would have made himself a costume.

00:15.700 --> 00:17.750
Is everyday life really so exciting?

00:18.550 --> 00:20.300
Are schools and offices so thrilling...

00:20.350 --> 00:22.550
...that I'm the only one who ever fantasized about this?

00:23.500 --> 00:25.050
Come on, be honest with yourself.

00:26.350 --> 00:27.800
At some point in our lives,...

00:28.400 --> 00:30.000
...we all wanna be a superhero.

00:43.350 --> 00:44.950
That's not me, by the way.

00:45.450 --> 00:48.650
That's some Armenian guy with a history of mental health problems.

00:50.800 --> 00:51.400
That's me.

00:51.750 --> 00:53.900
How come nobody's ever tried to be a superhero?

00:54.050 --> 00:56.650
Dude, if anybody did it in real life, they'd get their ass kicked.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.150
They'd be dead in like a day.

01:00.600 --> 01:01.950
Comic books had it wrong.

01:02.250 --> 01:04.700
You don't need a power to be a superhero.

01:08.450 --> 01:09.150
Oh, yeah!

01:10.150 --> 01:11.050
Didn't see that, did ya?

01:24.000 --> 01:24.600
Who are you?

01:25.350 --> 01:26.300
I'm Kick-Ass.

01:31.600 --> 01:32.700
So, you wanna play?
