Jason Kenyon loves playing video games.

00:05.070 --> 00:08.370
He thinks his love for the games is a notch below addiction.

00:08.700 --> 00:10.510
His parents were concerned.

00:11.340 --> 00:13.780
Well, to say the least, they didn't like it very much.

00:14.090 --> 00:16.320
They said, "Stop it and focus on a real career."

00:17.080 --> 00:19.220
But Jason thinks otherwise.

00:20.020 --> 00:23.050
I am really sure it's a real career.

00:23.450 --> 00:27.060
And I think, maybe when I'm finished with my bachelor's degree...

00:27.460 --> 00:29.290
...probably two or so years from now,...

00:29.830 --> 00:33.400
...I may be able to find work pretty easily compared to most other industries.

00:33.490 --> 00:35.140
So, I think I'll have a good future.

00:35.820 --> 00:38.200
Jason is one of a growing number of students...

00:38.300 --> 00:41.900
...seeking careers in the video gaming and technology industry.

00:42.440 --> 00:46.680
He is in the game development program at Montgomery College in Maryland.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.160
Deborah Solomon is a professor there.

00:53.410 --> 00:55.200
The future of video gaming is very bright...

00:55.320 --> 00:59.540
...because game technology is bleeding into virtually every other industry...

00:59.930 --> 01:06.860
...from military to homeland security, to health care, biotechnology, advertising, even news.

01:08.600 --> 01:13.270
She says the federal government is spending millions of dollars on game technology...

01:13.540 --> 01:17.210
...for training and recruiting personnel in various agencies.

01:19.910 --> 01:25.730
For example, the US Army developed a series of video games called "America's Army".

01:26.120 --> 01:28.420
The games, which can be downloaded free,...

01:28.620 --> 01:32.250
...are designed to help young Americans explore careers in the army.
