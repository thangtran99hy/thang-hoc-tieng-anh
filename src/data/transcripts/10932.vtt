00:00.350 --> 00:01.450
Do you have any strategies?

00:02.050 --> 00:04.950
What strategies can you suggest to keep a conversation going...

00:05.100 --> 00:07.250
...after you've met somebody, introduced yourself?

00:07.300 --> 00:12.300
Well, after you meet somebody, I think that one important way...

00:12.400 --> 00:18.100
...to keep a conversation going is to ask questions...

00:18.700 --> 00:20.300
...and answer questions.

00:20.500 --> 00:23.700
And when you ask a question, when you answer a question,...

00:25.900 --> 00:29.500
...I always try to include some extra information.

00:29.900 --> 00:33.550
For example, if someone says, "Where do you live?"

00:34.450 --> 00:37.550
I might say to them, for example, "I live in Ogikubo."

00:38.150 --> 00:41.650
"And I've lived there for 15 years."

00:42.000 --> 00:44.350
So, I might add some extra information.

00:44.950 --> 00:47.100
Or somebody might say, "Do you like Japan?"

00:47.350 --> 00:50.400
And I might say, "Yes, I like Japan very much."

00:50.750 --> 00:53.405
"I especially like Japanese food."

00:54.150 --> 00:56.300
And by adding that extra information,...

00:56.800 --> 00:59.200
...I introduce a new conversation topic...

00:59.850 --> 01:03.350
...and my conversation partner can use that information...

01:04.500 --> 01:08.850
...to continue the conversation in a different direction perhaps.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.850
This strategy sounds like it would be good though, for more than just introduction.

01:13.700 --> 01:14.400
I think it is.

01:14.450 --> 01:18.100
I think it's a good way to keep a conversation going...

01:19.250 --> 01:23.900
...not just in an introduction situation, but in any situation.

01:24.300 --> 01:28.550
I think students might use this conversation strategy...

01:29.300 --> 01:33.950
...in the classroom, when they're talking with their partners in class.

01:34.600 --> 01:35.500
Ask a question,...

01:36.100 --> 01:39.100
...answer the question, then add some extra information.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.950
Another thing you can do is you can add a question of your own.

01:44.050 --> 01:45.800
You can ask a question of your own.

01:46.250 --> 01:50.450
So for example, a partner may ask me,...

01:51.300 --> 01:51.950
..."Where do you live?"

01:52.250 --> 01:57.050
And I might say, "Well, I live in Ogikubo. I've lived there for 15 years."

01:57.850 --> 01:58.500
"How about you?"

01:58.700 --> 01:59.400
"Where do you live?"

01:59.850 --> 02:01.250
"And how long have you lived there?"

02:01.800 --> 02:04.750
So, I might ask a question of my own.

02:05.550 --> 02:09.300
But I think the thing you should try to avoid...

02:09.650 --> 02:11.850
...is just answering the question.

02:12.550 --> 02:15.100
So for example, if someone says, "Where do you live?"

02:17.200 --> 02:21.550
An answer that is not very good would be, "I live in Ogikubo."
