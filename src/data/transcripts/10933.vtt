00:06.180 --> 00:10.670
So, this is a quadratic equation essentially. We're trying to find the zeros.

00:10.910 --> 00:14.180
Salman Khan's disembodied voice is heard every day...

00:14.320 --> 00:16.730
...by tens of thousands of students around the world...

00:16.850 --> 00:18.850
...who are hungry for help learning math.

00:19.250 --> 00:21.880
He has posted 1,200 lessons on YouTube,...

00:22.180 --> 00:26.200
...lessons that appear on an electronic blackboard, and range from basic addition...

00:26.490 --> 00:27.760
...and advanced calculus,...

00:28.120 --> 00:29.390
...to science and finance.

00:29.730 --> 00:30.630
And they are free.

00:31.300 --> 00:32.820
Introduction to trigonometry,...

00:33.060 --> 00:35.660
...this is where I teach people about the trig functions.

00:35.770 --> 00:37.630
This is one of the more popular videos.

00:37.940 --> 00:40.810
This has 179,000 views.

00:41.070 --> 00:43.990
And you know, this is just what sine, cosine, and tangent are.

00:44.540 --> 00:47.430
Salman Khan lives in California, Silicon Valley...

00:47.610 --> 00:51.000
...with his wife, a rheumatologist in training at Stanford University,...

00:51.280 --> 00:52.350
...and their new baby.

00:52.680 --> 00:55.420
He got the idea for Khan Academy four years ago...

00:55.520 --> 00:58.890
...when he taught a young cousin how to convert kilograms to grams.

00:59.290 --> 01:01.820
With Khan's help, the cousin got good at math,...

01:02.160 --> 01:03.850
...and Khan launched a new career.

01:03.950 --> 01:05.090
Two plus two is four.

01:05.560 --> 01:09.900
Now, Khan records his lessons from a converted closet in the back of his bedroom.

01:10.180 --> 01:11.580
He never goes on camera.

01:11.850 --> 01:13.200
It kinda feels like the voice in their head.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.940
You're looking at it, it kinda feels like someone's over your shoulder talking in your ear,...

01:17.040 --> 01:19.310
...as opposed to someone at the blackboard that's distant from you.
