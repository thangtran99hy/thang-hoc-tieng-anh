00:00.800 --> 00:01.430
Come here.

00:07.470 --> 00:07.770
No!

00:09.540 --> 00:09.950
Outside!

00:23.220 --> 00:24.220
Meow.

00:27.760 --> 00:32.160
Agent 127 breaking radio silence, I have spotted Kitty Galore.

00:32.730 --> 00:34.500
Your mission will be revealed in HQ.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.640
This squirrel will self-destruct, but first...

00:36.730 --> 00:37.560
...a little dance.

00:43.740 --> 00:44.640
Next summer,...

00:44.710 --> 00:45.680
How you doin', big shot?

00:45.800 --> 00:46.940
Fine! Good!

00:47.510 --> 00:48.350
Nope, not good.

00:48.650 --> 00:49.480
Yeah, I'm gonna barf.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.520
...to take on a new breed of evil,...

00:52.630 --> 00:55.620
I will enslave all mankind.

00:56.940 --> 00:58.160
Someone's having a bad hair day.

00:58.620 --> 01:02.430
...two sworn enemies will have to do the unthinkable.

01:02.530 --> 01:05.560
Cats and dogs will have to work together.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.590
Am I the only one who thinks this is a bad idea?

01:09.030 --> 01:10.350
From Warner Bros. Pictures.

01:10.700 --> 01:11.270
Oh, yeah!

01:11.370 --> 01:13.060
I can't find my dog. Have you seen him anywhere?

01:14.240 --> 01:16.210
I love being a spy dog.

01:16.500 --> 01:21.140
This is historic. Three species putting aside all differences to solve a mystery.

01:21.910 --> 01:22.900
Real professional.

01:23.010 --> 01:24.020
What? I slipped.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.980
I don't know anything I tell you; my brain is a size of a grape...

01:27.350 --> 01:29.380
...or a raisin, either a big raisin or a little grape.

01:30.090 --> 01:30.850
Oh boy.

01:31.990 --> 01:34.290
Kitty, I'm home!

01:41.450 --> 01:43.700
Is it true there's a spot on your tummy...

01:43.850 --> 01:45.470
...and if I tickle it, your foot will shake?

01:45.730 --> 01:46.800
Nah! That's just a myth.

01:48.340 --> 01:48.990
Oh boy, that's it!

01:50.070 --> 01:52.740
Cats and Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore.

01:53.480 --> 01:54.650
Awesome.

01:54.800 --> 01:55.840
'Sup with these guys?

01:55.940 --> 01:57.050
Hopped up on catnip.

01:58.350 --> 01:59.710
Dude, I saw it blink.

02:00.830 --> 02:02.080
Unleashed in 3D...

02:02.410 --> 02:03.350
...next summer.
