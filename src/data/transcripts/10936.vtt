00:01.550 --> 00:03.550
This year, in this election,...

00:03.800 --> 00:07.100
...we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments,...

00:07.150 --> 00:10.900
...to hold them against a hard reality and see how we are measuring up...

00:11.450 --> 00:14.800
...to the legacy of our forebears and the promise of future generations.

00:15.200 --> 00:20.750
And fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, I say to you tonight:...

00:21.000 --> 00:22.900
...we have more work to do.

00:26.200 --> 00:30.300
More work to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois,...

00:30.800 --> 00:34.350
...who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico,...

00:34.750 --> 00:37.100
...and now are having to compete with their own children...

00:37.350 --> 00:39.000
...for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour.

00:40.200 --> 00:43.050
More to do for the father that I met who was losing his job...

00:43.300 --> 00:47.500
...and choking back the tears, wondering how he would pay $4500 a month...

00:48.150 --> 00:51.950
...for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.650
More to do for the young woman in East St. Louis,...

00:55.950 --> 00:57.350
...and thousands more like her,...

00:57.750 --> 01:00.600
...who has the grades, has the drive, has the will...

01:00.750 --> 01:03.100
...but doesn't have the money to go to college.

01:03.950 --> 01:05.550
Now, don't get me wrong.

01:05.800 --> 01:11.300
The people I meet in small towns and big cities, in diners, and office parks,...

01:11.550 --> 01:13.950
...they don't expect government to solve all their problems.

01:15.750 --> 01:17.700
They know they have to work hard to get ahead. And they want to.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.700
Go into the Collar Counties around Chicago...

01:20.850 --> 01:23.600
...and people will tell you they don't want their tax money wasted...

01:23.800 --> 01:26.000
...by a welfare agency or by the Pentagon.

01:30.600 --> 01:32.800
Go into any inner city neighborhood...

01:33.450 --> 01:38.100
...and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach our kids to learn.

01:38.250 --> 01:39.950
They know that parents have to teach,...

01:40.150 --> 01:43.100
...that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations...

01:43.300 --> 01:44.850
...and turn off the television sets,...

01:45.050 --> 01:49.950
...and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white.

01:50.100 --> 01:51.200
They know those things.

02:00.350 --> 02:03.550
People don't expect government to solve all their problems.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.950
But they sense, deep in their bones,...

02:07.600 --> 02:09.750
...that with just a slight change in priorities,...

02:09.800 --> 02:13.150
...we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life...

02:13.900 --> 02:16.150
...and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.100
They know we can do better.

02:18.800 --> 02:19.950
And they want that choice.

02:21.300 --> 02:24.200
In this election, we offer that choice.
