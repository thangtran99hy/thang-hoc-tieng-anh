00:01.000 --> 00:04.930
Studies show that global sugar consumption has risen dramatically...

00:05.270 --> 00:10.710
...from 11 million tons in 1900, to about 145 million tons today.

00:12.110 --> 00:16.410
Analysts attribute the growth to population increases and greater wealth.

00:16.910 --> 00:20.250
What used to be a rare food additive is now a staple.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.850
High fructose corn syrup and other forms of sugar...

00:24.120 --> 00:27.560
...are routinely added to processed food and many beverages.

00:27.990 --> 00:30.190
The study included all added sugar,...

00:30.460 --> 00:32.560
...even the sugar people add to their coffee.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.260
While this may be good for the sugar industry,...

00:35.500 --> 00:36.830
...it is not good for the heart.

00:37.570 --> 00:41.810
Dr. Miriam Vos and public health nurse Jean Welsh at Emory University...

00:42.240 --> 00:45.400
...collaborated in a study that shows eating a lot of sugar...

00:45.780 --> 00:48.290
...can increase your cholesterol and triglycerides,...

00:48.710 --> 00:51.810
...which make up body fat also known as lipids...

00:52.250 --> 00:54.920
...and that increases the risk for heart disease.

00:55.150 --> 01:00.520
Just like eating a high fat diet can increase your levels of triglycerides and cholesterol,...

01:00.960 --> 01:04.430
...eating sugar can also affect those same lipids.

01:04.690 --> 01:07.650
The researchers studied US government nutritional data...

01:07.960 --> 01:09.450
...and fat levels in the blood...

01:09.830 --> 01:13.150
...in more than 6,000 adults for at least six years.

01:13.540 --> 01:16.400
The participants were divided into five groups...

01:16.750 --> 01:21.140
...according to the amount of sugar and sugar-based sweeteners they consumed daily.
