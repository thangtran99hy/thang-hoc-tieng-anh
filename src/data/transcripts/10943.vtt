00:00.150 --> 00:02.650
A lifetime experience of small space living...

00:02.750 --> 00:06.350
...allowed Gary to create a truly unique, eco-friendly residence.

00:07.400 --> 00:11.200
The most surprising aspect of this ultrahip apartment is its size,...

00:11.700 --> 00:13.900
...only 330 square feet...

00:14.550 --> 00:19.600
Small area, but for us, small area means efficiency and user-friendliness.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.600
...and he sacrificed nothing in livability,...

00:23.250 --> 00:25.450
...nicknaming it "domestic transformer".

00:26.500 --> 00:29.100
By using a futuristic sliding wall system,...

00:29.750 --> 00:32.200
...Gary can make any room anything he wants.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.400
The house transforms and I'm always here, I don't move.

00:35.700 --> 00:36.650
The house moves for me.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.600
So, what appears to be just a simple wall...

00:40.400 --> 00:42.400
...can be moved to reveal a linen closet,...

00:43.700 --> 00:46.500
...which in turn can be moved to reveal a soaker bathtub...

00:47.650 --> 00:49.450
...and a pull-down guest bed above.

00:51.400 --> 00:56.700
This ingenious use of space enables this apartment to have up to 24 different combinations.

00:58.900 --> 01:01.800
The tiny space is naturally bathed in a warm, golden light...

01:02.250 --> 01:05.350
...that shines through the three floor-to-ceiling tinted windows.

01:06.550 --> 01:07.950
It makes me feel happy and warm.

01:08.550 --> 01:10.850
My home is always sunny even in gloomy weather.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.250
I practically don't need to turn on any lights most of the time.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.900
Using his unique sliding wall system,...

01:18.400 --> 01:21.200
...one room can be quickly transformed into another.
