00:00.310 --> 00:02.390
The Northwest is a place of spirits.

00:03.100 --> 00:07.200
Inside every tree stump or cast-off piece of driftwood is a dragon,...

00:07.440 --> 00:11.230
...an orca, or a mythic Thunderbird dying to get out.

00:12.110 --> 00:14.110
Roadside chainsaw woodcarver.

00:14.380 --> 00:15.240
You're one of us.

00:16.230 --> 00:19.520
And you deserve an insurance company that's carved out its own special niche.

00:20.120 --> 00:23.620
Helping Northwest people like you for nearly 60 years.

00:25.990 --> 00:26.460
PEMCO.

00:26.990 --> 00:27.790
We're a lot like you,...

00:28.300 --> 00:29.200
...a little different.
