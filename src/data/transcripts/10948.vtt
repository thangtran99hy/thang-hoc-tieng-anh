00:01.200 --> 00:04.000
I come here not to dispute the suggestion...

00:04.950 --> 00:07.350
...that I haven't yet achieved enough in my life.

00:10.100 --> 00:14.900
First of all, Michelle concurs with that assessment.

00:17.300 --> 00:21.000
She has a long list of things that I have not yet done,...

00:21.950 --> 00:23.550
...waiting for me when I get home.

00:27.550 --> 00:29.600
But more than that, I come to embrace...

00:29.700 --> 00:31.800
...the notion that I haven't done enough in my life.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.300
I heartily concur,...

00:35.800 --> 00:39.250
...I come to affirm that one's title,...

00:40.700 --> 00:44.600
...even a title like President of the United States...

00:45.700 --> 00:50.550
...says very little about how well one's life has been led.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.850
That no matter how much you've done or how successful you've been,...

00:56.150 --> 00:57.450
...there's always more to do,...

00:57.750 --> 01:00.250
...always more to learn and always more to achieve.

01:09.300 --> 01:11.200
And I wanna say to you today,...

01:12.200 --> 01:14.900
...graduates, class of 2009,...

01:16.950 --> 01:21.350
...that despite having achieved a remarkable milestone in your life,...

01:23.500 --> 01:28.400
...despite the fact that you and your families are so rightfully proud,...

01:30.150 --> 01:33.900
...you too cannot rest on your laurels.

01:35.250 --> 01:38.450
Not even some of those remarkable young people who were introduced earlier.

01:38.950 --> 01:42.350
Not even that young lady who's got four degrees yet today.

01:43.850 --> 01:44.900
You can't rest.

01:47.050 --> 01:51.600
Your own body of work is also yet to come.
