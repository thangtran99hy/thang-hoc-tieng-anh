Welcome to New York's Upper East Side!

00:05.050 --> 00:06.900
Playground to all my friends.

00:07.250 --> 00:09.300
Wanna know how the rich and popular live?

00:10.050 --> 00:12.150
Well, I live to diss and tell.

00:12.350 --> 00:14.850
Oh my god! You'll never believe what's on Gossip Girl.

00:14.900 --> 00:17.300
Someone saw Serena getting off a train at Grand Central.

00:17.700 --> 00:19.650
Meet the former It girl.

00:19.900 --> 00:22.100
I needed to get away from everything.

00:22.400 --> 00:23.500
Please just trust me.

00:23.650 --> 00:25.800
How can I trust you when I feel like I don't even know you?

00:26.200 --> 00:27.900
The ex best friends,...

00:28.100 --> 00:29.400
So, when's the party?

00:29.550 --> 00:32.100
Saturday and you're kinda not invited.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.200
...the boy who wants her,...

00:34.450 --> 00:35.200
Pick me up at eight?

00:35.400 --> 00:36.800
Do you really go out with some guy you don't know?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.600
Well, you can't be worse than the guys I do know.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.650
...and the boy who can't have her.

00:40.700 --> 00:41.100
Serena.

00:41.150 --> 00:44.050
No. Look, Blair's my best friend and you're her boyfriend,...

00:44.300 --> 00:45.050
...and she loves you.

00:45.100 --> 00:46.400
That's the way things are supposed to be.

00:48.300 --> 00:50.600
I guess popularity has its price.

00:50.650 --> 00:52.900
Aren't we entitled to choose just to be happy?

00:52.950 --> 00:54.950
What we're entitled to is a trust fund,...

00:55.400 --> 00:56.400
...a house in the Hamptons,...

00:56.500 --> 00:57.875
...maybe a prescription drug problem,...

00:57.900 --> 01:00.500
...but happiness does not seem to be on the menu.

01:00.550 --> 01:01.400
And who am I?

01:01.750 --> 01:03.800
That's one secret I'll never tell.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.500
You know you love me.

01:09.700 --> 01:12.350
Gossip Girl. Look for it on DVD.
