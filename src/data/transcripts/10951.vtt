Researchers think babies begin developing language skills while they are in the womb.

00:05.570 --> 00:08.600
Campbell was in law school when she was pregnant with Finn.

00:09.040 --> 00:11.470
Plus, I was finishing my last semester of law school.

00:12.040 --> 00:15.950
So, I guess, check back with me in 30 years and see if he's a litigator,...

00:16.050 --> 00:17.520
...because he definitely would,...

00:17.950 --> 00:22.020
...come alive in my Corporations classes and he always heard my professors speaking.

00:22.650 --> 00:26.960
Professor Kathy Hirsh-Pasek directs the Infant Language Laboratory...

00:27.320 --> 00:29.630
...at Temple University in Philadelphia.

00:29.990 --> 00:32.230
But we think the very first processes...

00:32.530 --> 00:34.530
...of language development are actually starting in the womb...

00:35.060 --> 00:37.630
...because they're overhearing their mother's speech.

00:38.030 --> 00:42.210
Researchers say that's when babies pick up the melodies of language.

00:42.810 --> 00:45.910
They can sometimes remember some of the words that they've heard...

00:46.340 --> 00:50.280
...and they appear to zoom in on classes of language.

00:50.380 --> 00:52.920
They may not know French from Spanish,...

00:53.180 --> 00:54.690
...but they know that that's in one group...

00:54.980 --> 00:57.090
...and that the English and German is in another group.

00:57.890 --> 00:59.160
There goes the doggy.

00:59.880 --> 01:02.460
Another study shows that babies and children...

01:02.760 --> 01:09.050
...who are frequently talked to have higher IQ scores and later on, do better in school.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.530
Throw it! What did the dog say?

01:12.010 --> 01:17.340
Child development specialist Judy Montgomery encourages parents to talk to their babies.

01:17.440 --> 01:23.180
Parents and caregivers, the family members, are the first ones to introduce vocabulary.

01:23.550 --> 01:26.420
And the more words the children hear, the greater their vocabulary.
