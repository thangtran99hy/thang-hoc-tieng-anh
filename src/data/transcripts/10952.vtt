We're looking to see if music can change the world.

00:11.440 --> 00:14.980
Grammy award-winning producer and film director Mark Johnson...

00:15.080 --> 00:17.950
...has dedicated his life to connecting people through music.

00:18.420 --> 00:22.750
He and his crew have recorded musicians around the world in their natural settings...

00:23.120 --> 00:27.460
...and he has compiled these recordings into a top-selling CD and DVD.

00:28.160 --> 00:32.360
Johnson recently finished his first concert tour of North America and Spain...

00:32.830 --> 00:34.730
...featuring some of these performers.

00:35.470 --> 00:37.800
One thing about, you know, making peace is that...

00:38.370 --> 00:39.770
...it's not necessarily one day...

00:40.140 --> 00:41.640
...where the whole world stops fighting.

00:42.010 --> 00:43.340
It's more of a state of mind...

00:43.770 --> 00:46.380
...and a consciousness of all the people here on the planet.

00:46.740 --> 00:50.310
So, what I think music can do is it can go from one heart to another heart...

00:50.750 --> 00:53.780
...and it can truly express the sentiment behind the words.

00:54.080 --> 00:59.410
Johnson says that growing up in New York City helped shape his vision of helping humanity.

00:59.610 --> 01:03.860
And as an interpersonal communications major at the University of New Hampshire,...

01:04.160 --> 01:06.960
...he learned how people create meaning in the world.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.170
Great music and art are moments in time.

01:09.700 --> 01:10.800
They exist everywhere.

01:10.900 --> 01:11.700
But in these,...

01:11.870 --> 01:15.670
...you can harness the energy to actually inspire everybody to believe more in each other...

01:15.970 --> 01:18.610
...and make a difference in a limited time we have in this world.
