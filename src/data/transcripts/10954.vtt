Welcome to Rocky Springs:...

00:04.083 --> 00:07.210
Future home to the greenest community ever built.

00:07.712 --> 00:09.894
So, you're gonna take out the whole forest?

00:09.973 --> 00:10.351
Yeah!

00:10.499 --> 00:13.823
But we're replacing it with a shopping mall with a forest theme.

00:15.479 --> 00:19.995
This is an opportunity to do something good for our family and for the environment.

00:20.132 --> 00:22.807
How is ripping out the forest good for the environment?

00:22.894 --> 00:26.713
The only thing standing in the way are the locals.

00:35.448 --> 00:36.666
You can't run.

00:41.945 --> 00:43.059
You can't hide.

00:43.144 --> 00:43.965
The animals are out to get me.

00:44.301 --> 00:45.431
This is insane.

00:47.018 --> 00:47.664
Shut up!

00:49.577 --> 00:53.229
You can't escape the furry.

00:56.165 --> 00:58.207
Help me!

00:58.675 --> 01:00.275
You're building on a nature preserve,...

01:01.513 --> 01:02.817
...and nature's ticked off.

01:10.632 --> 01:11.831
Brendan Fraser.

01:11.923 --> 01:12.899
You have a family.

01:13.325 --> 01:15.265
All this time you were protecting them.

01:15.446 --> 01:16.485
Come on, little fella.

01:23.349 --> 01:25.018
Furry Vengeance.

01:25.381 --> 01:26.525
Honey, are you in there?

01:27.337 --> 01:29.335
Don't worry, we will have you down in no time.

01:31.542 --> 01:32.757
You might wanna cover your eyes.
