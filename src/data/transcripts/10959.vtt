Hi, Kim.

00:01.200 --> 00:01.500
Hi!

00:01.750 --> 00:02.400
It's nice to see you!

00:02.450 --> 00:03.450
Thank you! It's good to be here.

00:03.900 --> 00:04.850
Thanks for coming in.

00:06.150 --> 00:07.550
I have a few questions for you.

00:07.725 --> 00:09.900
Okay, what would you like to know?

00:10.050 --> 00:13.500
Okay. First, I'd like for you to tell me about your family.

00:14.550 --> 00:18.500
My family. Well, I have a very small family here in Japan.

00:18.550 --> 00:20.900
I can tell you about my family in North America too.

00:22.550 --> 00:24.050
There are three people in my family:...

00:24.700 --> 00:28.850
...my husband and I are both college instructors,...

00:29.450 --> 00:31.200
...and our daughter is a student.

00:31.300 --> 00:34.100
She is in second year in a Japanese junior high school...

00:34.750 --> 00:36.250
...and she's 14.

00:36.350 --> 00:37.300
14, yes.

00:38.900 --> 00:41.700
We also have an adorable orange and white cat.

00:42.050 --> 00:43.100
She's a part of the family.

00:43.150 --> 00:48.650
She's four years old, which is 32 years for a human.

00:50.150 --> 00:52.750
We're a very busy family since we're both working.

00:54.750 --> 00:58.250
My daughter is very involved in the dance club at school,...

00:58.300 --> 00:59.700
...so she comes home quite late.

00:59.750 --> 01:01.250
Oh! What kind of dance?

01:01.600 --> 01:03.650
Well, she does mainly hip-hop.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.350
She loves the attire and the clothing.

01:09.150 --> 01:11.550
What do you do together as a family?

01:12.150 --> 01:14.950
Well let's see, we do a lot of things together.

01:16.950 --> 01:21.450
We go camping in the summer and the fall.

01:21.550 --> 01:23.800
But we especially like the latter part of the fall...

01:24.350 --> 01:25.650
...when the leaves are turning.

01:26.250 --> 01:29.600
We have a special place that we go to in Ibaraki-ken.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.800
...and we've kinda made that our spot,...

01:32.850 --> 01:36.500
...and we invite people to come and rent cabins with us.

01:37.100 --> 01:38.650
We also like travelling.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.850
We travel in the spring, in the summer together.

01:42.700 --> 01:46.500
Does this mean travel abroad or in Japan?

01:47.400 --> 01:47.650
Both.

01:47.950 --> 01:48.350
Oh, both.
