So, the idea here is to enable the creative impulses that the technology turns loose,...

00:06.000 --> 00:07.350
...and get the law out of the way.

00:07.450 --> 00:09.600
The work of Creative Commons is really about...

00:09.700 --> 00:13.710
...laying the infrastructure and groundwork for this new type of culture,...

00:13.910 --> 00:15.140
...a new kind of folk culture.

00:15.510 --> 00:18.510
Somebody from Delhi, somebody from New York, somebody from Singapore...

00:18.610 --> 00:21.720
...can feel comfortable using a photo that was created and...

00:22.150 --> 00:25.190
...given away by someone in the United States, or in China,...

00:25.290 --> 00:27.820
...or wherever that the license has been extended to,...

00:27.920 --> 00:29.590
...with their identity being preserved.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.600
Which means that people can actually...

00:32.290 --> 00:35.220
...create new kinds of things, come together and build things.
