Where did you get your ideas from?

00:10.700 --> 00:11.700
The ideas?

00:12.900 --> 00:15.250
Oh man! I got a million dreams.

00:16.900 --> 00:18.400
It's all I do. It's dream...

00:19.000 --> 00:19.750
...all the time.

00:20.725 --> 00:21.700
I heard you play the piano.

00:22.150 --> 00:23.600
No, no, this is not piano.

00:23.650 --> 00:24.600
This is dreaming.

00:54.650 --> 00:55.300
It's dreaming.

00:58.850 --> 01:04.550
Ellington once defined jazz as "Negro feelings"...

01:05.850 --> 01:07.400
...by which he meant "American Negro feelings",...

01:08.400 --> 01:10.750
...but to rhythm and tune.
