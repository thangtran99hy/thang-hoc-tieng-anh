00:01.150 --> 00:03.300
Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:03.400 --> 00:04.400
I'm your maitre d', Seita.

00:04.750 --> 00:07.450
This program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
Today's Maestro Hook,...

00:09.300 --> 00:11.600
...a good conversation piece you can use with a foreigner is...

00:12.100 --> 00:14.200
...the Western art of exaggeration.

00:14.950 --> 00:17.700
I'm sure you know, but Western people like to talk things up.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.050
They always say things bigger than it seems or they always exaggerate stories.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.750
Now remember, the reason they do this is because...

00:24.800 --> 00:27.700
...this is for making the conversation more interesting.

00:28.250 --> 00:32.050
And the reason they do that is because they want you to enjoy the conversation,...

00:32.150 --> 00:34.250
...so don't get insulted.

00:34.550 --> 00:38.100
The size of the conversation may be a little bit bigger, but enjoy the conversation.

00:38.150 --> 00:40.350
And at the same time, when you're talking,...

00:40.400 --> 00:42.700
...maybe you can exaggerate a little bit too, alright?

00:43.300 --> 00:44.750
So, today's Maestro Menu.

00:52.750 --> 00:54.000
Get your hopes up.

00:54.600 --> 00:55.300
Get your hopes up.

00:59.400 --> 01:00.550
I got my hopes up.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.150
I'm getting my hopes up.

01:07.500 --> 01:08.600
Don't get your hopes up.

01:16.050 --> 01:16.950
Okay, and next.

01:17.700 --> 01:18.400
A letdown.

01:19.050 --> 01:19.600
A letdown.

01:23.700 --> 01:25.300
Oh! It's a letdown.

01:26.750 --> 01:27.950
Such a letdown!

01:31.900 --> 01:33.500
Alright, Native Lines.

01:36.300 --> 01:38.350
You know, tomorrow's restaurant is gonna be really good.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.550
Oh! I got my hopes up.

01:43.600 --> 01:46.050
That restaurant yesterday was a letdown.

01:49.100 --> 01:52.000
Use English like this and you can be speaking like a native,...

01:52.250 --> 01:54.850
...and you'll be a native maestro any day now.

01:55.350 --> 01:59.000
Alright, thanks a lot and see you next week on Native Maestro.

01:59.600 --> 02:00.100
Bye-bye!

02:00.350 --> 02:01.400
It won't be a letdown.
