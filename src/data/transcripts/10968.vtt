Every adopted child wonders how he or she fits in.

00:06.160 --> 00:07.590
Where do they come from?

00:08.340 --> 00:10.370
What is their personal story?

00:10.740 --> 00:11.870
Do they belong?

00:12.940 --> 00:14.980
Whether parents communicate or not,...

00:15.290 --> 00:18.450
...these questions will always be present.

00:19.210 --> 00:21.550
Children will seek answers to their questions,...

00:21.780 --> 00:23.020
...so let's help them.

00:23.920 --> 00:28.390
Experience has taught us that communicating openly about adoption...

00:28.650 --> 00:31.030
...helps children with these questions.

00:31.770 --> 00:35.760
Talking openly lets children develop a healthy sense of identity...

00:35.860 --> 00:39.870
...and lets them know it's okay to talk about adoption.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.200
Through open communication,...

00:42.340 --> 00:46.200
...we can embrace rather than ignore our differences.
