00:00.200 --> 00:04.950
Well yeah, I was gonna ask you, which was harder or challenging for you:...

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
...living together or adjusting to the new environment, which is Tokyo?

00:09.750 --> 00:12.950
I think we were very excited to move to Tokyo, that it wasn't difficult.

00:13.050 --> 00:16.100
We were sort of open to, as much as possible you know,...

00:17.350 --> 00:18.400
...go in this taxi,...

00:18.850 --> 00:20.050
...and go in this subway.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.200
You know, most people will be scared,...

00:21.250 --> 00:23.650
...but it's like once we learned which lines to take,...

00:23.700 --> 00:27.850
...we were completely open to, sort of, living the life of a Japanese citizen.

00:28.400 --> 00:29.600
Japanese citizens?

00:30.050 --> 00:31.100
It wasn't difficult at all.

00:31.600 --> 00:32.550
It wasn't difficult?

00:32.600 --> 00:33.000
No.

00:33.650 --> 00:34.800
I mean, it was hard like,...

00:35.150 --> 00:38.400
...you know, when we were trying to get to like Sony Music, for instance.

00:38.450 --> 00:40.450
We had to do the train station by ourselves.

00:41.100 --> 00:44.800
Yeah. Sometimes, we get a little bit lost 'cause, you know, we can't quite read Japanese,...

00:44.850 --> 00:47.850
...but we are so excited that we launched first in Japan.

00:48.350 --> 00:50.200
You know, we think the culture is amazing.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.300
The music that they produce is just awesome.

00:52.650 --> 00:55.500
We're so happy that, you know, we're always in and they keep bringing us back.

00:57.300 --> 01:01.550
It's such a great thing to listen to those nice things from Japan.

01:02.150 --> 01:03.850
We can be criticized.

01:05.250 --> 01:06.250
Nobody in EastWest Boys.

01:06.650 --> 01:10.050
We really have had just like a really positive experience from Japan.

01:10.250 --> 01:11.650
And I think it has a lot to do with,...

01:11.700 --> 01:13.700
...you know, the people you work with through Sony,...

01:13.750 --> 01:16.600
...but, you know, the people we meet on the streets are so nice.

01:16.900 --> 01:19.000
We think that everybody's really hardworking here,...

01:19.100 --> 01:23.600
...very respectful and so we're just happy to be here.
