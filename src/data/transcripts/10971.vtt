00:00.200 --> 00:00.950
I'm from New York.

00:01.250 --> 00:02.700
And one of the things that I miss about New York...

00:02.750 --> 00:05.200
...was that when you're waiting for a long light...

00:08.150 --> 00:09.425
...at the intersection to cross.

00:09.550 --> 00:13.700
Almost every time, if you get there and you're just not able to cross the street...

00:13.750 --> 00:16.100
...and you decide to wait for the light to turn green,...

00:16.400 --> 00:17.700
...someone will start talking to you...

00:17.800 --> 00:19.650
...or you will start talking to somebody.

00:19.700 --> 00:22.600
It's like this sort of demilitarized zone.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.600
At each intersection and then the light turns red,...

00:25.650 --> 00:27.550
...you just get to talk to people who are around you.

00:27.600 --> 00:28.000
That is cool.

00:28.050 --> 00:31.350
And it's wonderful because the light is gonna turn green,...

00:31.500 --> 00:34.650
...and then that's a very comfortable, natural way to just sort of...

00:35.100 --> 00:37.250
...move back into the stream of your day,...

00:37.300 --> 00:38.550
...and just sort of separate from someone.

00:39.550 --> 00:40.550
Yeah, with little interaction.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.200
You can have a little interaction, you go off...

00:42.250 --> 00:44.950
...and you have a sense of what that person's soul is,...

00:45.000 --> 00:46.750
...you know, sort of and what they're like.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.700
If your car stopped at the light, they'll come up and wash your window.

00:52.450 --> 00:54.900
If you park your car, they'll sometimes break the window.

00:55.900 --> 00:58.700
They'll pull you out, steal your car. Carjacking.
