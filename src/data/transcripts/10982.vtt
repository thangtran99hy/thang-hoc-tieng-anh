00:03.000 --> 00:04.900
So, what do you think happens when you die?

00:10.000 --> 00:10.900
I don't think we die.

00:14.250 --> 00:15.400
Your body dies.

00:19.300 --> 00:20.350
But that's just your body.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.150
So, what continues on then...

00:29.800 --> 00:31.700
...if it's just your body that dies?
