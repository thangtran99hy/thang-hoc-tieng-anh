00:01.279 --> 00:02.403
Well, aloha!

00:03.845 --> 00:05.495
I was born and raised in Hawaii.

00:05.588 --> 00:08.590
Very excited to be here, you know, at TEDx Tokyo.

00:09.397 --> 00:13.430
You know, I met Patrick over at TED a few months ago and...

00:14.225 --> 00:17.845
...he's just an amazing individual and he's been a huge inspiration for me.

00:18.207 --> 00:19.455
So truly, it's an honor to be here.

00:20.033 --> 00:22.955
And just gonna tell you a little bit about myself before I start playing.

00:23.101 --> 00:24.823
This is my ukulele.

00:25.782 --> 00:28.230
And I've been playing since I was four years old.

00:29.112 --> 00:33.375
My mom, you know, she played and she taught me how to play.

00:33.793 --> 00:36.042
And I've been passionate about this instrument ever since.

00:38.726 --> 00:39.589
Well, here's an idea for you.

00:39.655 --> 00:43.297
I truly believe that the ukulele is the instrument of peace.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.134
You know, it's the instrument of peace...

00:45.283 --> 00:47.979
...because I truly believe that if everyone played the ukulele,...

00:48.312 --> 00:49.973
...this world would be a better place.

00:50.964 --> 00:53.791
So, I'm gonna try to prove that to you in a bit.

00:54.510 --> 00:57.431
But I started out playing a lot of Hawaiian music, you know, things like this.

01:00.466 --> 01:02.347
And then over the years, you know, as I got older...

01:02.449 --> 01:04.065
...I started listening to different styles of music.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.215
And then, those three chords became things like,...

01:10.128 --> 01:11.985
...you know, I start really rockin' out on this thing.

01:12.069 --> 01:14.434
So, I'm gonna play a little tune for you.

01:14.498 --> 01:18.595
This is a piece that was inspired by one of my favorite flamenco guitar players,...

01:19.018 --> 01:20.321
...the great Carlos Montoya.

01:20.765 --> 01:23.061
This is a piece entitled "Let's Dance".

01:23.735 --> 01:26.669
And here's what something I call flamenco ukulele.
