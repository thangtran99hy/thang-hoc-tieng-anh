Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:03.600 --> 00:04.650
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:04.850 --> 00:07.950
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:08.750 --> 00:10.600
Okay, today's Maestro Hook.

00:11.050 --> 00:14.500
This Hook you can use with businessmen when you're having a conversation with Westerners...

00:14.800 --> 00:16.550
...to get an interesting conversation going.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.900
So, there's an interesting story.

00:19.550 --> 00:23.300
There were two groups of businessmen, one Western and one Japanese.

00:23.700 --> 00:27.000
And their boss gave them two same projects at the same time.

00:27.400 --> 00:28.900
The project is exactly the same.

00:29.550 --> 00:33.200
The Westerners immediately started delegating and said, "You do this, you do that,"...

00:33.400 --> 00:34.800
...and started getting to work.

00:35.400 --> 00:39.250
And the Japanese group started exchanging business cards for the first 30 minutes.

00:40.150 --> 00:42.550
Which group do you think finished that meeting first?

00:43.600 --> 00:45.750
So, you might think the Westerners. But, no.

00:45.850 --> 00:48.250
Actually, they both finished at the same time.

00:49.100 --> 00:52.900
What it means is that Japanese people and Western people have a different way of doing business,...

00:52.950 --> 00:55.900
...but don't get so caught up 'cause the result is usually the same.

00:56.650 --> 00:58.750
So, today's Maestro Menu.

01:12.300 --> 01:14.100
What's on the agenda?

01:17.350 --> 01:18.200
What's on the agenda?

01:29.450 --> 01:30.750
What's on the agenda today?

01:31.300 --> 01:32.150
What's on the agenda?

01:43.150 --> 01:43.500
Okay.

01:52.600 --> 01:55.900
First things first.

01:58.100 --> 01:59.000
First things first.

02:11.850 --> 02:12.950
What's on the agenda today?

02:13.500 --> 02:14.700
Okay, first things first,...

02:15.500 --> 02:17.900
...let's talk about everyone's responsibility.

02:26.700 --> 02:30.250
Okay. So, in a situation like this, Maestro Lines.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.950
Okay, what's on today's agenda?

02:34.650 --> 02:37.150
Okay, we have a full-packed day today.

02:37.350 --> 02:38.550
So, everyone's gonna be busy.

02:42.600 --> 02:43.550
What's on today's agenda?

02:44.150 --> 02:46.600
Okay, first things first, let's talk about the budget.

02:53.750 --> 02:56.200
Okay. That's it for today and thanks a lot.
