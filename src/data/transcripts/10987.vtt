One, two, three.

00:03.400 --> 00:09.600
Ever since the late 19th century somewhere around 1886-88,...

00:10.400 --> 00:15.750
...Rutgers college students had a tradition of planting ivy at graduation...

00:16.300 --> 00:20.850
...of inscribing their class year on the side of Kirkpatrick Chapel...

00:21.150 --> 00:24.400
...and also smashing clay pipes on a cannon.

00:28.650 --> 00:33.800
What this was supposed to signify is a putting away of the dissipations of youth.

00:35.050 --> 00:38.500
Students as recently as the 1970s, I'm told,...

00:39.000 --> 00:42.400
...would smoke these clay pipes at the cannon...

00:42.700 --> 00:47.950
...and then proceed to smash them against the cannon as they got in line for graduation.

00:48.350 --> 00:54.100
And so today, we're attempting to recreate that here at the last Rutgers college commencement.

00:54.600 --> 00:58.400
The 1,700 or so students gathered here today,...

00:58.550 --> 01:04.200
...started here at Rutgers University as members of the Rutgers college class.

01:04.550 --> 01:08.800
And they were very clear that even after our reorganization...

01:09.200 --> 01:13.150
...of the undergraduate colleges into the school of arts and sciences,...

01:13.600 --> 01:20.450
...these students really very much wanted their diplomas to reflect the fact that they were admitted to Rutgers College.

01:20.550 --> 01:24.150
The group of undergraduates, not seniors, they're not graduates,...

01:24.550 --> 01:28.850
...have formed an organization called the Rutgers University Historical Society...

01:29.200 --> 01:35.300
...and they asked if we could please bring this tradition back in a big way for this last graduation.
