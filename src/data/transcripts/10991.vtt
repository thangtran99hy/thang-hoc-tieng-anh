Rhodey, I swear to God you make my stupid robots look like skilled Swiss technicians.

00:18.600 --> 00:18.950
Quiet!

00:22.350 --> 00:26.100
Oh! That was my favorite.

00:30.100 --> 00:30.800
Suit up, Rhodey.

00:31.700 --> 00:32.850
This one wants to play tag.

00:47.300 --> 00:48.800
Rhodey. Better late than never.

00:49.200 --> 00:49.800
I left you one.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.000
You're all heart.

01:03.300 --> 01:04.750
Thank God for product placement.

01:05.950 --> 01:08.700
Roxxon appears to be initiating a hostile takeover.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.900
When will the suit be finished?

01:29.650 --> 01:33.300
Roxxon always fulfills its contracts, General Shatalov, to the letter.

01:33.700 --> 01:34.800
And Stark?

01:35.200 --> 01:36.300
Unknown, unknown.

01:37.150 --> 01:38.550
I know what you're looking for...

01:40.050 --> 01:41.400
...and I know where to find it.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.650
Damn! I wouldn't have believed it if I haven't seen it with my own eye.

01:54.400 --> 01:57.250
See? I told you I could do it.

01:59.150 --> 02:01.800
I made her fly, Nicky. I made her fly.

02:03.250 --> 02:04.000
Right.

02:05.800 --> 02:06.400
You're impressed.

02:06.750 --> 02:07.200
I get it.

02:07.500 --> 02:07.950
I understand.

02:08.900 --> 02:09.900
Wanna take it for a spin?

02:10.550 --> 02:12.250
Looks like Shatalov has gone rogue.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.000
Enough gas in this thing to get me to Russia?

02:15.550 --> 02:17.600
Gas? You're so old school, Nicky.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.250
It'll get you where you need to go.

02:21.150 --> 02:22.050
Just be gentle.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.200
Last one home is a loser.
