We believe that if love is a chemical reaction,...

00:08.550 --> 00:12.200
...chemistry has a good chance to make the world a more harmonious place.

00:14.100 --> 00:16.800
Chemistry creates good relationships among the elements.

00:18.500 --> 00:23.400
It finds secret formulas to unite, rather than separate things.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.850
It works and then experiment after experiment.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.800
Bandages end up loving the water.

00:32.050 --> 00:33.800
Wheat can survive pests.

00:34.650 --> 00:37.000
Families are less afraid of energy bills.

00:37.900 --> 00:40.900
And even cars and city centers get along better.

00:42.600 --> 00:46.650
Chemistry ultimately creates good relationships between people...

00:47.300 --> 00:49.200
...and whatever they need in their lives.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.050
That's why we don't just make chemicals,...

00:52.700 --> 00:54.050
...we create chemistry.

00:55.800 --> 00:58.800
