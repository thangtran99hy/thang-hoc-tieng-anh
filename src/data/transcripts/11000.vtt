I was gonna say that the whole point of what I do, the Monster Ball, the music,...

00:06.433 --> 00:07.917
...the performance art aspect of it,...

00:08.333 --> 00:12.517
...I wanna create a space for my fans where they can feel free and they can celebrate,...

00:12.633 --> 00:16.583
...because I didn't fit in in high school and I felt like a freak.

00:16.967 --> 00:20.491
So, I like to create this atmosphere for my fans...

00:20.590 --> 00:24.035
...where they feel like they have a freak in me to hang out with.

00:24.148 --> 00:24.347
Yeah.

00:24.433 --> 00:25.537
And they don't feel alone.

00:30.167 --> 00:30.890
So, that's why.

00:31.167 --> 00:34.210
So, it isn't really for someone to talk about you.

00:34.413 --> 00:35.233
It is not for that.

00:35.300 --> 00:37.243
It really is to create a space for people.

00:37.500 --> 00:38.603
Well, this is really who I am.

00:38.673 --> 00:42.517
And it took a long time to be okay with that because, to show you all,...

00:42.669 --> 00:46.150
...and maybe in high school, Ellen, you feel discriminated against,...

00:46.280 --> 00:49.283
...it's like you don't fit in and you wanna be like everyone else,...

00:49.367 --> 00:52.850
...but not really, on the inside you really wanna be like Boy George, you know.

00:52.987 --> 00:53.198
Yeah.

00:55.767 --> 00:56.550
Oh, I did anyway.

00:56.700 --> 00:57.169
Yeah, yeah.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.717
So, I really, I want my fans to know that it's okay, you know.

01:03.067 --> 01:05.283
Sometimes in life you don't always feel like a winner,...

01:05.360 --> 01:06.563
...but that doesn't mean that you're not a winner.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.403
I was a rebel like you wouldn't believe.

01:09.263 --> 01:13.729
In high school, I wore outfits that I would, I think, be considered...

01:13.807 --> 01:18.050
...I was in Atlanta, a very small town in Texas, Atlanta, Texas...

01:18.500 --> 01:22.750
...and I wore an outfit that was, I would be the Lady Gaga of Atlanta, Texas, I think.

01:23.033 --> 01:24.750
Look at this crazy. I was wild.

01:24.913 --> 01:26.017
Look at the outfit I wore.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.617
Come on! Come on!

01:31.289 --> 01:32.102
I was a rebel.

01:33.583 --> 01:35.017
Well, that is shocking.

01:36.340 --> 01:37.935
It looks great. I love it.

01:38.029 --> 01:38.950
It's very 70s.

01:39.117 --> 01:40.736
Well then, I wanted to see what you would,...

01:40.812 --> 01:44.117
...I was ahead of my time because I'd put you in it, and I think you could carry it off.
