00:25.870 --> 00:26.350
Hi there!

00:28.250 --> 00:29.190
Welcome to NERV?

00:29.350 --> 00:32.260
We're a clandestine organization that answers directly to the UN.

00:32.530 --> 00:34.600
The key in the effort to rebuild our world.

00:34.860 --> 00:39.440
15 years ago in the second impact, half of the world's population was wiped out.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.800
Now the Angels have returned.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.240
There is little we can do to stop them.

00:45.670 --> 00:50.910
With limited options, we had to find a new solution to protect our way of life.

00:51.650 --> 00:55.220
You're looking at the most advanced weapon system ever developed by man...

00:55.680 --> 00:57.650
...the synthetic humanoid Evangelion.

00:58.690 --> 00:59.920
You will be the pilot.

01:04.360 --> 01:05.760
There are others like you,...

01:06.730 --> 01:10.100
...other Children burdened with the task of protecting our home...

01:10.950 --> 01:14.040
...and saving mankind from the brink of extinction.

01:18.880 --> 01:20.040
We are go for launch.

01:21.440 --> 01:24.250
Evangelion Unit 01 move out!

01:32.820 --> 01:34.560
The Evas can beat the Angels.

01:34.760 --> 01:38.330
The fact that we are even here to see this means that mankind has a sliver of hope.

01:39.410 --> 01:43.430
I want you to understand that you're not the only one risking your life in this fight.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.630
We are all in this together.

01:48.740 --> 01:49.900
Move, Shinji!
