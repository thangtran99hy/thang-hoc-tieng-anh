Hey! Welcome to AERA English TV.

00:02.250 --> 00:03.400
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:03.550 --> 00:06.700
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:07.300 --> 00:10.100
On top of a building on a very beautiful day.

00:10.600 --> 00:15.550
So, today's Maestro Hook is about this. Ham.

00:15.650 --> 00:16.900
But not the food, ham.

00:18.100 --> 00:21.950
In the Western culture, whenever boys are talking or girls are talking,...

00:22.500 --> 00:23.700
...there's always the ham.

00:23.950 --> 00:27.800
It's one person who gets picked on or you make jokes about the person,...

00:27.850 --> 00:29.050
...then that person is a ham.

00:29.850 --> 00:31.500
It's kinda like the person that gets picked on,...

00:31.600 --> 00:34.100
...but it's all fun and games so don't worry about it.

00:34.700 --> 00:37.000
And also in English, we have the punch line.

00:37.400 --> 00:41.200
And we have a punch line at the end of the story that makes the story funnier.

00:41.350 --> 00:44.050
So sometimes, when someone's talking and there's no punch line,...

00:45.550 --> 00:46.900
..."Hey, where did the punch line go?"

00:47.500 --> 00:48.550
So, it's kinda like that.

00:49.200 --> 00:49.450
Alright.

01:00.300 --> 01:01.100
Do the math.

01:13.700 --> 01:15.050
Come on, do the math.

01:17.250 --> 01:17.600
Alright.

01:29.250 --> 01:29.700
Duh!

01:36.150 --> 01:36.500
Duh!

01:39.050 --> 01:40.100
What day is today?

01:40.950 --> 01:42.050
Duh! Today is Wednesday.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.100
Was today Wednesday?

01:46.150 --> 01:47.850
Oh, come on! Do the math. It's Wednesday.

01:56.050 --> 01:57.450
Native Lines. For example,...

01:58.550 --> 02:01.350
..."Um, when was the meeting that was gonna be held today?"

02:02.300 --> 02:03.800
"Come on, today. Do the math."

02:05.650 --> 02:09.850
"Um, is today Wednesday? It was Tuesday yesterday."

02:09.950 --> 02:11.450
"Yeah, duh! It's Wednesday."

02:17.550 --> 02:20.050
So Native Maestro, next week keep tuned.

02:20.250 --> 02:21.300
Alright, see you later!
