Performing is my life, you know, it's what I've been doing for the past 12 years.

00:24.290 --> 00:27.060
With the Black Eyed Peas, there's no nervousness.

00:28.430 --> 00:29.990
You know the songs all by heart.

00:35.770 --> 00:39.770
Performing in the Rose Bowl with U2, and it's 100,000 people,...

00:40.040 --> 00:41.140
...that's a big dream.

01:00.560 --> 01:06.130
Thank you so much. We are the Black Eyed Peas.

01:06.830 --> 01:14.840
Our music has touched, you know, Philippines, Chile, Lithuania, Moscow, Slovakia, Korea.

01:15.900 --> 01:18.140
The music we make, it's colorless.

01:22.280 --> 01:24.510
My biggest fear is like losing touch.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.420
So, I put a studio in my house...

01:27.750 --> 01:29.680
...'cause I don't ever wanna not be connected.

01:32.420 --> 01:35.660
My mom bought me a JVC radio for Christmas one year.

01:37.120 --> 01:38.390
I learned how to record...

01:38.560 --> 01:41.733
...and then loop my favorite parts by playing and pausing,...

01:41.770 --> 01:43.835
...rewinding, playing, and pausing; and then I rap over that.

01:45.740 --> 01:50.050
So, my mom made me hungrier to go out and achieve bigger things.

01:57.150 --> 01:58.350
And then, a song happens.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.020
You could write in the dark.

02:03.320 --> 02:04.540
You in your little studio.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.990
You're hearing the same beat ten times over,...

02:07.930 --> 02:10.630
...and you're getting hypnotized by your own stuff,...

02:12.290 --> 02:15.630
...and you don't know if ever people are gonna react towards it.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.210
Before I write a song, I make a beat,...

02:24.810 --> 02:25.400
...I play the beat,...

02:25.940 --> 02:28.240
...figure out who's building to it and write to that one...

02:28.410 --> 02:29.410
...that had the best response.
