00:02.160 --> 00:03.830
So, what makes up this dark matter?

00:03.930 --> 00:06.970
Well, that's one of the missions of the Large Hadron Collider.

00:07.400 --> 00:13.880
The LHC near Geneva is a big tunnel of pipes and magnets, and detectors more than 100 meters underground.

00:14.310 --> 00:17.210
It's about 27 kilometers in circumference.

00:17.700 --> 00:21.890
27. So big, it takes a slice out of both France and Switzerland.

00:22.150 --> 00:27.820
It's the most complicated, most complex device ever built I would say.

00:27.920 --> 00:30.510
And what does it do? It collides protons.

00:30.610 --> 00:32.830
Protons are part of the nucleus of an atom.

00:33.130 --> 00:40.000
The LHC shoots huge numbers of these protons in two beams going in opposite directions around the LHC...

00:40.240 --> 00:42.340
...and very close to the speed of light.

00:42.440 --> 00:47.640
When we're going full blast, the beams are gonna collide 40 million times a second, roughly.

00:48.610 --> 00:50.020
40 million times a second!

00:50.380 --> 00:51.920
And we're gonna look at all the data that comes out.

00:52.350 --> 00:53.520
Particles are streaming out.

00:53.720 --> 00:58.990
These collisions should be of such force to replicate the energy density of a very young universe.

00:59.090 --> 01:01.990
A trillionth of a second after the "Big Bang".

01:02.290 --> 01:07.500
Dark matter particles were key ingredients of that very early, very hot, dense universe.

01:07.660 --> 01:13.130
Those energies in that small space was enough that you can actually make dark matter make new things.

01:13.230 --> 01:16.770
And so, particles were zooming around in that early universe, colliding off each other.

01:17.170 --> 01:19.670
Particles that don't even exist today.
