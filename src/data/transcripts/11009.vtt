00:02.400 --> 00:06.050
Tropical cyclones are called typhoons in Asia...

00:06.100 --> 00:08.600
...and hurricanes in North and South America.

00:09.150 --> 00:12.550
These storms go around like a wheel turning to the left...

00:12.800 --> 00:15.200
...when they hit in the northern part of the world.

00:15.800 --> 00:19.400
They have wind speeds of 60 kph or more.

00:19.900 --> 00:24.250
In the United States, the Tropical Prediction Center in Miami, Florida...

00:24.500 --> 00:26.450
...keeps an eye out for hurricanes.

00:26.800 --> 00:30.350
When meteorologists detect a hurricane, they give it a name.

00:30.750 --> 00:33.300
They can use either a male or female name.

00:33.900 --> 00:36.450
Why should tropical cyclones have names?

00:37.000 --> 00:41.600
The name makes it easier for people to keep up with information about a hurricane...

00:41.850 --> 00:43.400
...and its possible dangers.

00:43.950 --> 00:47.400
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO),...

00:47.700 --> 00:51.400
...an international weather group, decides what names will be used.

00:51.850 --> 00:55.650
The WMO makes lists of names using the English alphabet.

00:56.300 --> 00:58.950
Each name on the list starts with a different letter.

00:59.250 --> 01:03.450
The first hurricane of the year gets the first name on that year's list.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.700
The second hurricane gets the next name.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.600
For example, if the first hurricane is named Abel,...

01:09.900 --> 01:11.650
...the second might be named Betty.

01:12.350 --> 01:18.600
The name lists do not include names beginning with the letters Q, U, X, Y, and Z.

01:19.150 --> 01:22.050
There aren't many names that begin with these letters.

01:22.600 --> 01:27.800
Asian countries use a different list, which is made up by the WMO's Typhoon Committee.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.850
This list has a few personal names,...

01:31.100 --> 01:36.350
...but most of the names are of flowers, animals, trees, and other similar things.
