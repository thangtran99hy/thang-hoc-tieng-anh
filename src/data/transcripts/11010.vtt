Tiger Woods started playing golf when he was two years old.

00:06.100 --> 00:09.800
Now, he is one of the most famous professional golfers in the world.

00:10.550 --> 00:12.550
Tiger is from the United States.

00:13.050 --> 00:16.600
His father is African-American and his mother is Thai.

00:17.150 --> 00:21.000
His real name is Eldrick, but everyone knows him as Tiger,...

00:21.500 --> 00:23.050
...the nickname his father gave him.

00:23.900 --> 00:27.050
He started playing golf professionally in 1996...

00:27.650 --> 00:32.300
...and won all four of the World Golf Championships before he turned 25.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.050
He holds the record as the youngest player ever to win all four of these championships.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.150
Although he has played on many great golf courses,...

00:41.850 --> 00:45.100
...one of Tiger's favorite places to play is Pebble Beach.

00:45.650 --> 00:48.100
Tiger became a role model at an early age.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.450
People look up to him, so he is very grateful...

00:52.150 --> 00:54.500
...because many people helped Tiger as a child,...

00:55.100 --> 00:57.200
...he wants to lend a hand to others now.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.850
Some people cannot play golf because of their ethnicity...

01:01.300 --> 01:03.250
...while others do not have enough money.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.600
Occasionally, Tiger himself was prevented from playing golf.

01:08.300 --> 01:11.600
Because of this, he created the Tiger Woods Foundation...

01:12.150 --> 01:14.050
...to help make golf open to everyone.

01:15.150 --> 01:17.500
He likes to see diversity on the golf course...

01:18.050 --> 01:20.750
...and he wants all children to play golf if they want to.

01:21.450 --> 01:25.900
Tiger is happy that many children now want to play golf because of him.
