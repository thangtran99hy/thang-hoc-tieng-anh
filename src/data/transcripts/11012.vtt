00:04.209 --> 00:09.055
These young actors have come a long way in the three and a half weeks since they started rehearsing...

00:09.241 --> 00:10.547
...Shakespeare's "Henry V".

00:11.253 --> 00:13.211
None of them is here by choice.

00:16.419 --> 00:18.796
Some people are here for worse reasons than others, but, I don't know,...

00:18.863 --> 00:20.389
...I'm here because of assault and battery.

00:21.593 --> 00:23.100
Tim is 15 years old.

00:23.542 --> 00:27.067
Like most of the teens here, he was not a fan of the bard.

00:27.345 --> 00:30.207
The judge sentenced me here, so my first thoughts were kinda...

00:34.102 --> 00:38.651
...Shakespeare is not my thing, you know, plays kinda, I'd rather not...

00:39.276 --> 00:43.453
...but it's a lot easier than picking up trash, you know, and doing that.

00:44.518 --> 00:45.715
So you know, I gave it a try.

00:47.913 --> 00:51.297
And he has discovered there's a lot to like about Shakespeare.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.161
Assault and battery and you hand me a sword?

00:53.472 --> 00:55.739
In Shakespeare, I didn't think that was going to happen, not at all.

00:55.803 --> 00:56.944
I'm glad they trust us though.

00:57.869 --> 01:02.403
The trust and respect shown by theater director Kevin Coleman is mutual.

01:03.055 --> 01:05.699
These teens clearly enjoy working with him,...

01:05.833 --> 01:08.891
Here we go! And reach to the ceiling. Left hand,...

01:09.533 --> 01:11.523
...left hand. Breathing, breathing, breathing.

01:11.861 --> 01:14.533
...as he inspires them to embrace Shakespeare.

01:17.105 --> 01:18.089
Very nice!

01:18.739 --> 01:19.225
Again!

01:20.941 --> 01:23.892
If you present it to them...

01:26.586 --> 01:30.639
...in a way that engages their imagination,...

01:31.128 --> 01:38.320
...that engages their playfulness, that engages their willingness, which is no mean feat.

01:39.061 --> 01:43.835
But if you can engage that, they come alive.
