00:01.000 --> 00:04.470
But the Beatles, they weren't the first rock stars.

00:05.330 --> 00:09.860
They'd be the first to say that others had opened that door for them.

00:10.810 --> 00:14.460
But they blew the walls down for everybody else.

00:15.280 --> 00:18.985
In a few short years, they had changed the way that we listened to music,...

00:19.650 --> 00:24.450
...thought about music and performed the music forever.

00:25.250 --> 00:29.190
They helped to lay the soundtrack for an entire generation,...

00:30.060 --> 00:33.400
...an era of endless possibility and of great change.

00:34.230 --> 00:35.860
And over the four decades since,...

00:36.300 --> 00:37.630
...Paul McCartney has not let up,...

00:38.340 --> 00:41.910
...touring the world with the band "Wings" or on his own,...

00:42.340 --> 00:45.880
...rocking everything from small halls to Super Bowls.

00:46.540 --> 00:50.030
He's composed hundreds of songs over the years with John Lennon,...

00:50.750 --> 00:52.980
...with others or on his own.

00:53.950 --> 00:57.720
Nearly 200 of those songs made the charts, think about that...

00:58.790 --> 01:02.930
...and stayed on the charts for a cumulative total of 32 years.

01:14.140 --> 01:16.870
And his gifts have touched billions of lives.

01:17.970 --> 01:21.280
As he later confessed at the Beatles' first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show,...

01:21.380 --> 01:23.380
...where he carried that bass out,...

01:24.120 --> 01:25.880
...that one evening that changed everything,...

01:26.790 --> 01:30.350
...Paul said, "Luckily, we didn't know what America was."

01:31.890 --> 01:35.490
"We just knew our dream of it, or we probably would have been too intimidated."

01:36.990 --> 01:40.330
Tonight, it is my distinct pleasure...

01:40.900 --> 01:47.500
...to present America's highest award for popular music on behalf of a grateful nation,...

01:48.580 --> 01:53.620
...grateful that a young Englishman shared his dreams with us,...

01:53.980 --> 01:54.880
...Sir Paul McCartney.
