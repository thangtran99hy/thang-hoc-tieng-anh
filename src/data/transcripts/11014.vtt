00:02.800 --> 00:06.100
The inventors of the first airplane were not scientists.

00:06.450 --> 00:09.050
In fact, they did not even finish high school!

00:09.700 --> 00:14.250
The inventors of the first airplane were just ordinary brothers with a big dream,...

00:14.700 --> 00:16.100
...a dream of flying.

00:16.900 --> 00:21.050
Wilbur and Orville Wright grew up in Indiana in a large family.

00:21.750 --> 00:23.750
Neither of the brothers finished high school.

00:24.450 --> 00:26.500
Instead of sitting in class and reading,...

00:26.900 --> 00:30.300
...they wanted to work and make things, like machines.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.750
When the brothers were 18 and 22 years old,...

00:34.150 --> 00:37.200
...they started up their own printing press and bicycle shop.

00:38.100 --> 00:41.750
One day, Wilbur read an interesting story in the newspaper...

00:42.050 --> 00:44.350
...about a man trying to fly in a glider.

00:45.050 --> 00:48.500
The man died, but the story gave Wilbur an idea.

00:49.250 --> 00:53.600
He decided to teach himself about flying in order to make the perfect glider.

00:54.300 --> 00:59.000
Together, Orville and Wilbur successfully tested their new glider on the beach.

00:59.650 --> 01:03.450
Then, the brothers decided to make their glider into a flying machine.

01:04.150 --> 01:09.700
They put an engine and propeller on the glider, and called their new machine the "Wright Flyer".

01:10.500 --> 01:14.800
The plane broke down on its first test, but the Wright brothers didn't give up.

01:15.450 --> 01:19.600
With a little more hard work, the "Wright Flyer" made a successful flight!

01:20.100 --> 01:24.450
On December 17th 1903, the Wright brothers made history...

01:24.750 --> 01:29.000
...by flying the "Wright Flyer" over the beach at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.

01:29.650 --> 01:31.200
The airplane was born.
