A young woman without eyebrows is seated in front of a beautiful landscape.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.600
Does this sound familiar to you?

00:09.300 --> 00:12.700
This is one of the most famous works by Leonardo da Vinci.

00:13.200 --> 00:15.100
The Mona Lisa is a beautiful painting.

00:15.500 --> 00:19.450
However, it was the mystery behind the painting that intrigued people.

00:20.200 --> 00:23.100
Who was the woman and why did da Vinci paint her?

00:23.700 --> 00:26.800
Different theories have been proposed about her identity.

00:27.450 --> 00:31.950
Many art and history buffs thought that it was a portrait of da Vinci himself,...

00:32.200 --> 00:33.050
...but as a woman.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.950
Others thought it was not any particular person, but the ideal of a woman.

00:38.600 --> 00:41.700
They say this is why she was painted with no eyebrows.

00:42.150 --> 00:44.400
This gave her face a more unearthly look.

00:45.300 --> 00:49.000
Still, others thought that it was a portrait of an actual woman of the time,...

00:49.300 --> 00:51.650
...the wife of Francesco del Giocondo.

00:52.450 --> 00:57.450
In 2005, historian Armin Schlechter of Heidelberg discovered the answer.

00:58.200 --> 01:01.250
While looking through an old manuscript, he found a small note.

01:01.700 --> 01:07.050
In this, the woman in the Mona Lisa was positively identified as Lisa del Giocondo.

01:07.750 --> 01:11.650
The artist had been paid to do her portrait after the birth of her second child.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.900
"Mona," in fact, means "madam" in Italian.

01:15.350 --> 01:17.000
As for her unearthly look?

01:17.550 --> 01:21.000
Historians say women of this time liked to remove their eyebrows.

01:21.500 --> 01:24.450
Apparently, they thought eyebrows were not attractive.
