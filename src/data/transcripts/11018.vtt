00:00.600 --> 00:04.930
Common sense tells us that when the risks are weighed, the decisions are made very differently.

00:06.470 --> 00:08.000
When crimes against humanity...

00:09.300 --> 00:12.610
...are punished consistently and severely,...

00:12.950 --> 00:14.780
...the killer's calculus will change,...

00:15.780 --> 00:19.200
...and when a killer is allowed to walk away from his crimes,...

00:19.950 --> 00:21.880
...I believe that also tells him something.

00:22.450 --> 00:24.890
It sends a message to the next that they need not worry,...

00:25.990 --> 00:29.490
...that they will most likely not be held accountable for their actions.

00:31.770 --> 00:35.700
I believe that the existence of trials alone has the potential to change behavior,...

00:37.100 --> 00:40.240
...but ultimately, we need to arrest those who are indicted.

00:42.180 --> 00:45.720
And the Sudanese arrest of Ali Kushayb appears to be a positive development,...

00:46.940 --> 00:49.010
...but not if it becomes a bargaining chip...

00:49.750 --> 00:51.890
...that will stop others from being brought to justice.

00:56.150 --> 01:00.690
Without an arrest, we tell the victims of these atrocities that impunity is the rule of law.

01:03.420 --> 01:06.130
Now, I don't know if the ICC is the answer,...

01:07.300 --> 01:09.270
...and I don't know what type of court is...

01:09.400 --> 01:13.080
...or what it would need to be for all of us to agree and make it strong enough.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.070
I have no idea.

01:16.810 --> 01:21.340
And after seven years of traveling into the field, I find that I have a lot I need to learn.

01:23.210 --> 01:24.310
But I do know this,...

01:25.450 --> 01:28.060
...no mother who had her children killed in front of her,...

01:28.850 --> 01:30.790
...no young girl sold into slavery,...

01:31.860 --> 01:34.790
...no boy kidnapped and forced to be a child soldier,...

01:36.030 --> 01:40.230
...and no young girl like the three-year-old I met in Sierra Leone who had her limbs cut off...

01:40.800 --> 01:43.000
...should be expected to simply forget.

01:43.830 --> 01:47.440
No one should have to choose between peace or justice,...

01:48.000 --> 01:52.170
...and that young boy in Darfur who asked for a trial deserves one.
