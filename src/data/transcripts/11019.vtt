00:02.700 --> 00:04.900
There are deserts all over the world.

00:05.250 --> 00:09.300
They can be found in Africa, China, South America and North America.

00:09.750 --> 00:12.000
In some places, deserts are growing.

00:12.400 --> 00:16.400
This is a serious problem because deserts destroy farmland,...

00:16.650 --> 00:18.700
...and ruin land where animals live.

00:19.350 --> 00:22.450
When people cannot grow food or find animals to eat,...

00:22.750 --> 00:24.050
...they have to leave their homes.

00:24.450 --> 00:27.250
Sometimes, nature can cause deserts to spread.

00:27.750 --> 00:31.550
Wind can move sand away from deserts and onto useful land.

00:32.050 --> 00:36.450
When there is no rain for a long time, plants die and deserts grow.

00:36.900 --> 00:40.100
However, humans can also cause deserts to grow.

00:40.550 --> 00:44.350
This is called desertification and it happens in many ways.

00:44.900 --> 00:48.100
One way is when people cause too much air pollution,...

00:48.250 --> 00:49.750
...which can make an area hotter.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.050
Hotter weather can reduce the amount of rain as well.

00:53.650 --> 00:56.650
Too many people in one area can also damage the land.

00:57.400 --> 01:00.350
In addition, having many animals can harm the land.

01:00.800 --> 01:05.800
When large animals like cows walk on soil too much, they turn it into dust.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.700
The wind easily blows this dust away.

01:09.450 --> 01:11.700
Trees help hold water in the ground.

01:12.300 --> 01:14.400
When people cut down too many trees,...

01:14.700 --> 01:17.700
...less water stays in the ground and the soil is ruined.

01:18.700 --> 01:21.700
All of these things can speed up desertification.

01:22.400 --> 01:26.750
To stop deserts from growing, people must think of ways to treat the land better.
