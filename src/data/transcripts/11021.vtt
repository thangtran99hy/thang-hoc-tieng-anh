00:22.590 --> 00:24.220
How are you today?

00:24.620 --> 00:25.590
Are you OK?

00:25.830 --> 00:27.320
I hope so.

00:27.630 --> 00:29.890
Are you happy?

00:30.330 --> 00:31.730
I hope so.

00:32.090 --> 00:35.500
In today's lesson, we're going to talk all about...

00:35.830 --> 00:40.140
...saying hello and goodbye.

00:53.150 --> 00:54.920
When we first meet someone...

00:55.220 --> 00:59.390
...whether it is a person we know or someone we are meeting for the first time,...

00:59.760 --> 01:03.630
...we will normally use a simple sentence as a way of greeting them.

01:04.130 --> 01:07.510
A greeting is a friendly way of opening a conversation...

01:07.740 --> 01:11.570
...or as a way of letting the other person know that we have seen them.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.900
There are many ways to say hello.

01:18.570 --> 01:19.410
Hi!

01:20.310 --> 01:21.240

01:22.240 --> 01:23.080
Hi there!

01:23.850 --> 01:24.620
Hello there!

01:25.550 --> 01:26.780
Hey! How are you doing?

01:27.780 --> 01:28.660
Howdy friend!

01:29.420 --> 01:30.250
What's up?

01:31.020 --> 01:31.950
How's it going?

01:32.790 --> 01:34.690
Wow! It's good to see you.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.860
We sometimes use a double greeting.

01:38.290 --> 01:39.190
For example,...

01:39.670 --> 01:42.030
..."Hi there! Hey, how are you doing?"

01:43.060 --> 01:45.060
"Hello! How have you been?"

01:45.860 --> 01:48.840
"It's good to see you! How's life been treating you?"

01:50.570 --> 01:52.270
Saying goodbye.

01:53.310 --> 01:55.990

01:57.480 --> 01:58.150

02:15.230 --> 02:16.130

02:17.130 --> 02:17.870
