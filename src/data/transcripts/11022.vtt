A young actress is about to go onto the stage.

00:06.200 --> 00:09.800
As she waits by the side of the stage, she looks nervous.

00:10.350 --> 00:12.300
You might hear her whisper to her friend,...

00:12.750 --> 00:14.900
..."I've got butterflies in my stomach."

00:15.600 --> 00:17.200
Butterflies in her stomach?

00:17.600 --> 00:19.000
How did those get in there?

00:19.750 --> 00:25.500
The feeling of butterflies comes from chemicals produced by the body in stressful situations.

00:26.150 --> 00:29.950
One chemical that the body makes under stress is cortisol.

00:30.750 --> 00:34.150
This chemical benefits the body in normal situations.

00:34.600 --> 00:39.300
In fact, it helps the body start normal activities in the morning after waking up.

00:39.950 --> 00:45.200
It also plays a role in helping the body and mind respond well to healthy exercise.

00:45.750 --> 00:48.100
However, when the body is under stress,...

00:48.450 --> 00:51.000
...extra cortisol begins to affect the stomach.

00:51.650 --> 00:57.100
For some people, cortisol shuts down the stomach, producing the funny feeling of butterflies.

00:57.700 --> 01:01.000
For others, cortisol speeds up the way the stomach works,...

01:01.250 --> 01:03.250
...which makes these people feel sick.

01:03.700 --> 01:08.500
All you need to do to get rid of a few butterflies in the stomach is just relax.

01:09.100 --> 01:14.000
Laughing with or talking to others about your stress can help reduce it.

01:14.600 --> 01:19.500
Stepping out onto the stage will also help those butterflies fly away.
