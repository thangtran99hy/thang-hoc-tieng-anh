Every mammal needs sleep, as do birds and reptiles, such as snakes.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.250
But what about insects?

00:09.400 --> 00:10.350
Do they need sleep?

00:11.000 --> 00:16.350
Scientists have been trying to discover the truth about insect sleep behavior for years.

00:16.900 --> 00:20.350
Scientists first thought insects did not need sleep.

00:20.750 --> 00:24.850
According to them, the insect brain was not complex enough to need it.

00:25.500 --> 00:31.100
Scientists said that some kinds of brain activity, like dreaming, were sleep behaviors.

00:31.500 --> 00:35.600
Insects do not dream, so scientists said that they did not sleep.

00:36.050 --> 00:38.700
They believed that insects rested, instead.

00:39.400 --> 00:43.600
However, new studies have shown that some insects may actually sleep.

00:44.250 --> 00:46.900
There are four types of behavior during sleep.

00:47.350 --> 00:51.150
First, sleeping people and animals don't move much.

00:51.550 --> 00:54.000
Also, they have a position for sleeping.

00:54.350 --> 00:55.750
For example, they lie down.

00:56.150 --> 01:00.600
Additionally, they don't wake up easily when hearing noises or seeing light.

01:01.400 --> 01:06.900
Lastly, they are able to come out of sleep quickly in response to some intense stimulant.

01:07.650 --> 01:11.200
Scientists have now seen similar behaviors in fruit flies.

01:11.600 --> 01:16.550
For example, fruit flies become still every night for about seven hours.

01:17.050 --> 01:19.350
At these times, they sit in a different way,...

01:19.750 --> 01:23.850
...let their antennae drop and do not respond to quiet noises.

01:24.500 --> 01:28.050
The flies do begin to move around when louder noises are made.

01:28.700 --> 01:33.000
Scientists think that some insects may have their own unique kind of sleep.
