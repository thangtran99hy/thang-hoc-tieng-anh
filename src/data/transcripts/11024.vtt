Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:03.300 --> 00:04.450
I'm your maitre d', Seita.

00:04.750 --> 00:07.750
This program is designed to help you become the native maestro...

00:07.900 --> 00:10.600
...under such great weather and beautiful view today.

00:10.950 --> 00:15.700
Today's Maestro Hook is about the word "just" in Japanese and English.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.250
Japanese people use the word "just" a lot.

00:18.350 --> 00:18.950
For example,...

00:20.650 --> 00:21.450
Or for example,...

00:23.050 --> 00:23.400
Or,...

00:25.150 --> 00:28.700
In English, the word "just" means "only", so we don't really use it that much.

00:28.750 --> 00:29.350
For example,...

00:30.650 --> 00:32.150
...is seven o'clock sharp.

00:33.050 --> 00:33.400
Also,...

00:34.600 --> 00:39.100
Idea is already just an idea, so you say, "Oh, it's an idea." No "just".

00:39.950 --> 00:40.300
And....

00:41.600 --> 00:43.100
...is maybe perfect for me.

00:43.700 --> 00:46.500
But we don't really say that either as a perfect match.

00:47.150 --> 00:52.100
So, don't use the word "just" and use the word that's perfect for the sentence.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.050
And today's Maestro Menu.

00:54.600 --> 00:58.550
Today's Maestro Menu is about the perfect words to say in a perfect moment.

00:58.650 --> 00:59.150
For example,...

01:08.100 --> 01:09.100
It rings a bell.

01:12.050 --> 01:13.350
Oh, yeah! It rings a bell.

01:17.750 --> 01:19.350
Oh! It just rings a bell.

01:21.650 --> 01:22.300
It rings a bell.

01:25.550 --> 01:27.500
Also, one more. There's another one called,...

01:30.500 --> 01:31.650
Off the top of my head.

01:32.650 --> 01:34.350
This is off the top of my head.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.550
Oh! So, I have an idea off the top of my head.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.800
Alright, Maestro Lines.

01:50.700 --> 01:53.800
Do you know the company, Sony?

01:53.950 --> 01:55.050
Oh, yeah! It rings a bell.

01:58.750 --> 02:00.350
Anybody have any good plans?

02:01.050 --> 02:04.250
Oh! Actually, I have an idea, but it's just off the top of my head.

02:04.450 --> 02:05.050
Is that okay?

02:05.400 --> 02:06.550
Yeah, yeah, please say it.

02:08.900 --> 02:09.250
OK.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.700
Alright! So, from the top of a building, see you guys next week.

02:16.850 --> 02:17.250
Bye-bye!
