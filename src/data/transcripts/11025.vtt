Hi! I'm Aya and I'm from New York.

00:03.433 --> 00:08.650
And I was born and raised there, so I look Japanese but inside I'm American.

00:09.100 --> 00:13.383
So, I kind of learned Japanese very naturally and English at the same time.

00:13.967 --> 00:15.783
But right now, I'm learning French.

00:15.865 --> 00:20.561
And I feel the best way to learn French is to watch a lot of movies in French,...

00:20.923 --> 00:23.450
...but subtitles in Japanese or English.

00:23.733 --> 00:27.817
That way, when you hear audio, you can comprehend it by reading.

00:28.267 --> 00:31.183
So, in that sense, it's kind of doing two things at once.

00:31.767 --> 00:33.317
So, I highly recommend that.

00:35.633 --> 00:37.917
Hello everyone, my name is Johan from Sweden.

00:39.367 --> 00:43.683
The way I learned English was naturally by growing up.

00:43.767 --> 00:45.450
I never studied English actually.

00:46.433 --> 00:50.183
But in Sweden, all media, all movies, and all music...

00:50.300 --> 00:54.783
...are imported from English speaking countries, usually America and England.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.950
And we never dub our movies,...

00:58.034 --> 01:03.183
...so if we see a movie or TV show, even a children's program, it's always subtitled.

01:03.800 --> 01:08.350
So, we learned to read Swedish and at the same time, we learned to understand English.

01:08.667 --> 01:10.517
So, that's a very good sum of things.

01:11.133 --> 01:13.350
Please watch movies and listen to music as much as possible.

01:14.967 --> 01:17.450
Hi, my name is Yua and I'm from Singapore.

01:18.267 --> 01:22.683
I started learning Japanese when I was 12, and I grew up learning English.

01:23.200 --> 01:27.983
So to me, the best way to learn a language is actually to learn how to speak.

01:28.433 --> 01:32.017
And so, whenever I have a piece of article like newspaper,...

01:32.100 --> 01:38.450
...I would try reading them out aloud and make it more fluid after reading it a few times.

01:38.900 --> 01:43.450
And I also recommend an online newspaper portal like New York Times...

01:43.800 --> 01:48.383
...where you can actually click onto the word and find out how it sounds like.

01:48.700 --> 01:53.617
So I guess, knowing how to pronounce the word is the best way to learn the languages.
