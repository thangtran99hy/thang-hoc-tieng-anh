Newspapers and television news programs always seem to report about the bad things happening in society.

00:09.750 --> 00:13.450
However, there is a place where readers can find some good news.

00:13.750 --> 00:16.700
That place is the website called "HappyNews".

00:17.400 --> 00:20.400
The man behind "HappyNews" is Byron Reese.

00:20.800 --> 00:27.500
Reese set up "HappyNews" because he thought other news sources were giving people an unbalanced view of the world.

00:28.250 --> 00:29.900
Reese said about "HappyNews",...

00:30.300 --> 00:36.550
..."The news media gives you a distorted view of the world by exaggerating bad news, misery and despair."

00:37.150 --> 00:39.050
"We're trying to balance out the scale."

00:39.750 --> 00:42.050
Not everyone agrees with Reese's view, though.

00:42.400 --> 00:48.350
Many people think that news sources have a responsibility to provide news that is helpful to people.

00:49.050 --> 00:52.450
People need to know about issues or problems in today's society.

00:53.100 --> 00:58.450
Then, people are better able to make informed decisions about things that affect their daily lives.

00:59.300 --> 01:04.400
Reese said that "HappyNews" is not trying to stop people from learning about issues or problems.

01:04.850 --> 01:08.600
"HappyNews" is just trying to provide a balanced picture of today's world.

01:09.150 --> 01:14.200
By the end of its first month online, "HappyNews" had more than 70,000 unique readers.

01:14.650 --> 01:16.950
About 60 percent of those readers were women.

01:17.800 --> 01:21.600
Something else unique makes "HappyNews" different from any of the other news...

01:21.650 --> 01:24.000
...or information websites that are on the Internet.

01:24.750 --> 01:30.300
Unlike many other websites, "HappyNews" gets fan mail from its readers on a daily basis.
