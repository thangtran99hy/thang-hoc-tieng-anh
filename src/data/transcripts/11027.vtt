Companies these days spend thousands of dollars on their computer security.

00:07.650 --> 00:10.650
They buy the best firewalls and computer programs.

00:11.100 --> 00:16.600
However, Kevin Mitnick thinks the biggest danger these days is not a weakness in technology.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.600
In the 1990s, Kevin Mitnick was an infamous hacker.

00:21.050 --> 00:24.150
He hacked into government and corporate computer systems.

00:24.550 --> 00:28.750
After being sent to prison, Mitnick decided to use his skills in a different way.

00:29.250 --> 00:31.700
He started his own computer security firm.

00:32.250 --> 00:35.200
He now advises people on how to keep their computers safe.

00:35.900 --> 00:39.100
According to Mitnick, the biggest danger to security is people.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.750
However by this, he doesn't mean hackers.

00:42.050 --> 00:44.800
In fact, he means the people using the programs.

00:45.550 --> 00:51.250
"If an attacker can get one trusting person to give his or her information, the attacker gets in."

00:51.550 --> 00:53.800
"All that money spent is basically wasted."

00:54.250 --> 00:58.550
A hacker can get around everything with just one person within the company.

00:59.450 --> 01:01.950
Unfortunately, people are still too trusting.

01:02.350 --> 01:05.650
In a recent test of the US tax office (the IRS),...

01:05.950 --> 01:08.850
...security experts called 100 managers.

01:09.300 --> 01:11.800
They posed as IRS computer technicians.

01:12.300 --> 01:15.700
The experts were able to fool 35 of the managers.

01:16.100 --> 01:18.350
They gave both their passwords and IDs.

01:18.950 --> 01:22.000
In the hands of real hackers, this would have been a disaster!
