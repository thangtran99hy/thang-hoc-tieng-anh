How often have you gone to a vending machine to get a bag of chips?

00:07.000 --> 00:09.600
What if you found a pair of live beetles instead?

00:10.150 --> 00:15.500
It may sound strange, but a company in Japan sells large beetles through vending machines.

00:15.950 --> 00:21.650
The vending machine company and nature conservationists disagree about selling beetles this way.

00:22.400 --> 00:25.250
Many school-age children in Japan collect beetles.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.800
Other people also enjoy this hobby.

00:28.300 --> 00:31.600
However, people are building houses where the beetles live.

00:32.150 --> 00:34.250
This destroys the beetles' homes.

00:34.750 --> 00:37.650
Now, it is difficult to find the beetles in the wild.

00:38.300 --> 00:44.200
Since 1999, the Mirai Seiko Company has been selling these beetles in vending machines.

00:44.800 --> 00:48.950
The company says that it wants to help people own these rare insects.

00:49.650 --> 00:53.100
It also says that it takes good care of the beetles in the machines.

00:53.650 --> 00:56.500
True or not, the machines are very popular.

00:57.150 --> 01:00.600
The machines sell more than 1,500 beetles per month.

01:01.250 --> 01:05.900
Sometimes, people buy all the beetles in a machine in just a few minutes.

01:06.600 --> 01:10.300
On the other hand, conservationists feel that the machines are harmful.

01:11.050 --> 01:15.750
Children may think that living creatures are like soft drinks or boxes of candy.

01:16.550 --> 01:20.050
Do you feel that the vending machines give people a rare experience,...

01:20.450 --> 01:22.500
...or that they give children bad ideas?

01:23.100 --> 01:26.250
Either way, they show how clever people can be.
