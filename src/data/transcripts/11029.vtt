Hello! Welcome to Michael's Business English Top Tips.

00:04.030 --> 00:06.540
This month we're looking at Holland's Codes.

00:06.940 --> 00:11.670
Holland's Codes are very useful ways to help us understand our work personality.

00:12.610 --> 00:14.880
By identifying our work personality...

00:15.180 --> 00:21.090
...we can choose the job and work activities that will maximize our job satisfaction.

00:22.260 --> 00:25.350
There are six personality types of the Holland's Codes.

00:25.890 --> 00:26.690
Realistic.

00:27.190 --> 00:31.030
This type are people who prefer working with their hands.

00:31.260 --> 00:33.930
Physical, mechanical, engineering kind of work.

00:34.730 --> 00:36.330
Second, investigative.

00:36.800 --> 00:41.640
These people like more intellectual activities such as science and research.

00:42.540 --> 00:43.710
Third, artistic.

00:44.240 --> 00:49.040
These people prefer creative, original kind of work and activities.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.180
Fourth, social.

00:51.850 --> 00:54.150
This type enjoys working with other people.

00:54.420 --> 00:57.520
Maybe as a teacher, carer, social worker, etc.

00:58.490 --> 01:00.360
Fifth, enterprising.

01:00.790 --> 01:05.900
These people like competitive kinds of jobs and activities that are goal oriented.

01:06.330 --> 01:08.300
All of business leaders fall into this type.

01:09.470 --> 01:10.900
Sixth, conventional.

01:11.430 --> 01:15.000
These people like working with data, figures, numbers, etc.

01:16.410 --> 01:21.590
Now, all of us fall under maybe not just one, but two or three of these types.

01:22.580 --> 01:24.280
First, we should try to identify,...

01:24.550 --> 01:26.950
...think which types best match us.

01:27.750 --> 01:31.470
This will help us choose the kind of job and work that we will enjoy.

01:32.720 --> 01:35.460
Secondly, list up what we do in our work,...

01:36.090 --> 01:40.060
...then we can identify which ones match our personality type.

01:41.130 --> 01:43.600
And finally, develop our work personality.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.400
By understanding our work personality,...

01:46.770 --> 01:50.110
...we can see which areas should we improve and develop.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.510
For example, maybe social skills.

01:52.940 --> 01:56.810
This can further help us to maximize our job satisfaction.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.110
Thank you and good luck!
