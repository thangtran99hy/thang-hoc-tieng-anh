You are an amazing singer, but I wonder how critical are you about yourself after performances?

00:08.033 --> 00:09.250
I'm like my harshest critic.

00:09.967 --> 00:11.850
I'm never satisfied with my performance,...

00:11.933 --> 00:14.770
...but I'm not too hard on myself,...

00:14.833 --> 00:18.917
...but at the same time, I don't think that you can think that you're amazing every time.

00:19.002 --> 00:21.168
You have to have something to critique yourself on,...

00:21.233 --> 00:23.617
...otherwise you're gonna get conceited and that's not so good.

00:23.687 --> 00:26.450
You have to always make believe that there's room to improve.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.450
So, how do you think did you do at the Olympics?

00:32.033 --> 00:34.783
Oh, that one? Actually, I was really happy with that one.

00:35.500 --> 00:39.650
That was the one performance where I was just completely satisfied.

00:41.300 --> 00:42.916
So, tell us about the album.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.183
How would you describe it?

00:45.500 --> 00:46.517
It's very eclectic.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.317
There's a lot of different genres on there.

00:50.033 --> 00:51.283
It's kind of just like me, you know.

00:51.372 --> 00:53.650
You get to know me through the music which is really great.

00:53.729 --> 00:57.783
It's like, you know, you hear the covers here who influenced me.

00:58.067 --> 01:00.983
And then you go to the original songs and you see how they influenced me.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.983
So, I cover all the original songs except for one,...

01:04.300 --> 01:06.983
...so you also get to see how I think, the words and stuff.

01:07.933 --> 01:10.117
Is there a particular theme to the album?

01:12.033 --> 01:15.317
There's basically Nikki, you know, that's the name.

01:16.433 --> 01:18.383
It's just kind of getting to know me.
