00:00.127 --> 00:02.822
Let's compare things.

00:02.900 --> 00:03.934
Tell me which one is better,...

00:05.607 --> 00:06.641
...just say Tokyo or New York.

00:07.850 --> 00:08.422
The food?

00:09.174 --> 00:09.643
Tokyo.

00:11.346 --> 00:12.017
Transportation?

00:14.945 --> 00:15.625
Tokyo.

00:15.903 --> 00:17.002
Okay. Entertainment?

00:18.279 --> 00:18.958
New York.

00:21.505 --> 00:26.027
Depends though, because I love watching Rakugo and Kabuki too.

00:26.966 --> 00:28.332
Can't get that in New York, really.

00:28.426 --> 00:30.183
No. So, it depends.

00:30.565 --> 00:31.095
Okay.

00:32.030 --> 00:35.463
For music, maybe more music nightly in New York.

00:35.889 --> 00:37.084
Certainly for jazz.

00:37.195 --> 00:37.570
Yes.

00:37.899 --> 00:43.162
But I'd be surprised if you couldn't find more classical concerts in Tokyo.

00:43.303 --> 00:44.970
There's a lot of classical music going on, is there?

00:45.461 --> 00:45.792
Yeah.

00:45.960 --> 00:48.847
I heard somewhere that there were like 400 classical concerts a year.

00:49.207 --> 00:49.470
Yes.

00:49.752 --> 00:50.418
It's nuts!

00:50.551 --> 00:50.993
Yeah.

00:52.225 --> 00:54.590
Okay. Let's see, lifestyle?

00:59.221 --> 01:03.152
I have pretty much the same lifestyle in both places so,...

01:03.764 --> 01:05.285
Well, you're a special case though.

01:05.431 --> 01:11.473
...yeah, I like either hanging out with friends and family or playing the piano.

01:11.571 --> 01:12.539
So, it's the same thing.

01:14.020 --> 01:20.515
Okay. What about the way the people hang out in Tokyo or in New York, which do you like better?

01:23.178 --> 01:26.263
Well, the things you do with your friends, like they're not the same, right?

01:26.565 --> 01:28.473
Do you do the same things with your friends in both places?

01:28.693 --> 01:29.185
Yeah.

01:29.315 --> 01:29.759
Really?

01:29.869 --> 01:30.491
Yes.

01:31.075 --> 01:34.267
Your Japanese friends enjoy the same sort of things like your American friends?

01:34.935 --> 01:35.374
Yeah.

01:36.223 --> 01:36.828
What do you do?

01:38.741 --> 01:40.131
We just go out for a drink.

01:42.715 --> 01:46.775
Yeah, but I like Japanese beer more than American beer,...

01:46.924 --> 01:52.927
...so I enjoy, you know, more here, I mean, in a drinking point of view.

01:53.025 --> 01:54.518
Right, right, right, right, right.

01:54.929 --> 01:56.587
What's your favorite area in Tokyo to eat or drink?

01:59.521 --> 02:00.230
Asakusa.

02:00.631 --> 02:01.213
Asakusa?

02:01.812 --> 02:04.905
Because I like rakugo and I like people there.

02:07.659 --> 02:08.277
Really?

02:08.427 --> 02:10.315
There are a lot of jazz clubs there too.

02:11.462 --> 02:13.767
I know there are jazz bars there. Are there jazz clubs?

02:13.882 --> 02:14.228
Yeah.

02:14.595 --> 02:16.273
There is music nightly there.

02:16.822 --> 02:17.317
No kidding?

02:17.425 --> 02:19.577
Yes, it's like West Village in Japan.

02:21.659 --> 02:23.459
Japan's West Village is Asakusa.

02:23.615 --> 02:25.011
I would have never guessed.
