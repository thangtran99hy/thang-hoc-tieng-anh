Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:03.800 --> 00:04.950
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:05.400 --> 00:08.250
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:09.100 --> 00:11.650
Okay. Business situation, today's Hook.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.800
A Hook is a good conversation piece that you can use with people when you're talking.

00:15.650 --> 00:18.200
Today's Hook is about the culture of debating.

00:18.800 --> 00:20.850
Western people really like to debate.

00:21.600 --> 00:25.500
In the order of debate, you have to say something that you disagree with somebody.

00:25.900 --> 00:29.200
So, a lot of times, Western people when they're talking, they'll disagree with you...

00:29.250 --> 00:33.150
...or they'll be the devil's advocate, and they'll say the opposite that they're thinking.

00:33.950 --> 00:38.100
Japanese people tend to get hurt during this situation and they get offended,...

00:38.550 --> 00:44.500
...but Western people, it's really good that each person is giving them input and new ideas.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.450
So, don't get insulted, it's just part of a culture.

00:47.800 --> 00:52.250
And the more ideas, the better something gets, so please let people debate,...

00:52.300 --> 00:53.900
...and debating is a very healthy thing.

00:54.800 --> 00:57.500
So, in that kind of situation, the Native Menu.

01:11.300 --> 01:15.500
That's food for thought.

01:32.250 --> 01:33.350
That's food for thought.

01:53.400 --> 01:54.350
It's an eye opener.

02:07.250 --> 02:08.700
Wow! That's an eye opener.

02:16.250 --> 02:17.450
Oh, wow! It's an eye opener.

02:23.500 --> 02:24.900
Okay. And Maestro Lines.

02:27.600 --> 02:30.200
Maybe we should go with plan B, not A.

02:31.100 --> 02:33.000
Oh, wow! You know what, that's food for thought.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.000
Yeah! I'm gonna go think about it, that one.

02:35.600 --> 02:36.150
Thanks a lot!

02:38.100 --> 02:40.500
You know, how about doing it the opposite way?

02:41.500 --> 02:43.400
Oh, wow! You know what, that's an eye opener.

02:43.850 --> 02:45.100
I couldn't have thought of that.

02:45.450 --> 02:46.000
Thank you!

02:52.650 --> 02:54.000
Alright, thanks a lot!

02:54.200 --> 02:58.100
And business English, there's always more good stuff in AERA English's Native Maestro.

02:58.500 --> 03:01.500
So, see you next week and have fun speaking English.

03:01.900 --> 03:02.300
Bye-bye!
