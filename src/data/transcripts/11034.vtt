Do you often use shampoo or put ketchup on your food?

00:06.673 --> 00:08.301
Have you ever visited a sauna?

00:09.044 --> 00:13.147
If you think these words are originally English, you'd better think again.

00:13.612 --> 00:17.203
In fact, each of these words comes from a different language!

00:17.759 --> 00:22.545
Shampoo, for example, is actually a word from the Hindi language in India.

00:23.308 --> 00:25.590
This word originally meant "massage."

00:26.195 --> 00:31.094
In hair shops in India, barbers massage your head while washing your hair.

00:31.623 --> 00:36.899
Over time, British people in India used this word to mean "a liquid that cleans hair."

00:37.459 --> 00:39.477
Almost everyone knows what ketchup is.

00:40.224 --> 00:45.124
People all over the world like to pour this tomato sauce on French fries or sandwiches.

00:45.840 --> 00:50.626
This word is originally Chinese from "ketsiap," a fish sauce.

00:51.265 --> 00:55.937
In the 1600s, British and Dutch sailors brought this fish sauce to Europe.

00:56.475 --> 01:00.237
Over time, people changed the sauce by adding tomato flavor to it,...

01:00.661 --> 01:02.698
...but the name basically stayed the same.

01:03.258 --> 01:07.505
Sauna, a popular type of public steam room and shower facility,...

01:07.753 --> 01:09.523
...comes from the Finnish language.

01:10.040 --> 01:12.095
During one of the European Olympics,...

01:12.395 --> 01:17.608
...athletes from Britain and Germany saw Finnish athletes use saunas after training.

01:18.204 --> 01:23.502
Later, the general public all over Europe started using this style of bathing, too.

01:24.169 --> 01:28.157
Now, we still use this word to describe all kinds of steam rooms.

01:28.608 --> 01:32.598
English is full of many wonderful borrowed words from many languages.

01:33.327 --> 01:39.621
Perhaps English should change its name to Eng-hin-chi-fin-fre-ger-ital-span-ish!
