Almost all of these pictures are taken by a spacecraft with telescopes on board,...

00:08.530 --> 00:13.840
...which either flew past the planet, or orbited it, or landed on the surface of that planet.

00:17.020 --> 00:20.200
The images originate with missions that range from...

00:20.520 --> 00:24.490
...the Lunar Orbiter series of the '60s, those were the earliest pictures here, to...

00:24.620 --> 00:30.360
...really cutting-edge shots from Saturn and Mars, from probes that are still working today.

00:30.730 --> 00:35.460
Basically, what I did is I went in and I served as curator of a vast number of images.

00:35.730 --> 00:41.510
I searched through hundreds of thousands of raw frames from Voyager and Viking, and so forth.

00:41.970 --> 00:45.000
The Viking was a Mars orbiter of the '70s and '80s,...

00:46.200 --> 00:47.810
...looking for the extraordinary shots.

00:47.910 --> 00:52.680
I also have an eye for abstraction, I have to confess and I like pictures that...

00:55.050 --> 00:56.680
...subvert expectation a bit.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.690
This is a global dust storm on Mars...

01:00.560 --> 01:04.690
...and it's comprised of about 90 individual frames...

01:04.830 --> 01:07.930
...from the Viking orbiter of the late '70s, early '80s.

01:11.830 --> 01:15.840
Mars is the only planet that we know that has global storms...

01:16.200 --> 01:19.370
...and so, this is, I think, a really good example of that,...

01:20.780 --> 01:23.190
...and I find that it has an almost biblical fury.
