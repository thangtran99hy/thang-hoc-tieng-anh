Some doctors think that you should drink a glass of water each morning.

00:07.100 --> 00:10.500
You should drink this water first thing, before doing anything else.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.050
The temperature of the water should be similar to body temperature,...

00:14.450 --> 00:16.400
...neither too hot nor too cold.

00:16.950 --> 00:18.550
Why should you drink this water?

00:19.050 --> 00:21.050
Water helps your body in many ways.

00:21.450 --> 00:23.000
It helps clean out your kidneys.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.650
It prepares your stomach for digestion.

00:26.300 --> 00:28.750
Water can also help your intestines work better.

00:29.500 --> 00:34.400
After drinking water, the intestines can more easily take out nutrients from our food.

00:35.200 --> 00:38.300
Water also helps us go to the bathroom more easily.

00:39.100 --> 00:44.300
Scientists suggest that people take in 1,600 milliliters of water each day.

00:44.950 --> 00:47.350
But don't drink all of that water in one sitting.

00:47.800 --> 00:51.500
If you do, your kidneys will have to work much harder to eliminate it.

00:52.150 --> 00:55.700
It's better to drink some in the morning and some in the afternoon.

00:56.450 --> 01:00.200
Some people think it's better to drink between meals and not during meals.

01:00.850 --> 01:04.300
They think water dilutes the juices produced in our stomachs.

01:04.650 --> 01:06.900
This can interfere with normal digestion.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.700
Are you drinking enough water every day?

01:10.250 --> 01:11.850
Check the color of your urine.

01:12.250 --> 01:15.250
If it is light yellow, you are probably drinking enough.

01:15.900 --> 01:20.600
If your urine is very dark yellow, you probably need to drink more water.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.300
A little more water each day could make you much healthier!
