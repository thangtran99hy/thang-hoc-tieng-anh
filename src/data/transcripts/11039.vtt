00:02.600 --> 00:04.550
Come on! You're not gonna back out now,...

00:04.900 --> 00:06.350
...not in front of a lady.

00:11.800 --> 00:15.200
Oh! How I wish I was back in my cage with my mirror and my little bell.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.150
Bobo here can't fly.

00:18.650 --> 00:20.900
Don't worry Blu, it's in your DNA...

00:21.200 --> 00:23.750
...and if our featherless friends can do it, how hard can it be?

00:29.300 --> 00:29.750
Fun, right?

00:30.500 --> 00:31.850
Yeah, fun.

00:32.550 --> 00:36.700
Flying is not what you think up here, it's what you feel in here...

00:37.150 --> 00:40.200
...and when you feel the rhythm of your heart, you fly!

00:43.750 --> 00:44.450
Keep it simple.

00:44.550 --> 00:45.400
Easy breezy.

00:45.500 --> 00:46.900
Thrust, lift, drag.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.050
Oh, come on! Let's go!

00:48.450 --> 00:49.750
Come on, Blu! You can do it!

00:49.800 --> 00:52.700
I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. I can't do it!

00:56.050 --> 00:58.000
I can't fly!

01:03.000 --> 01:03.450
Am I dead?

01:03.700 --> 01:05.550
No, we're still alive!

01:08.150 --> 01:10.300
From the creators of the Ice Age trilogy,...

01:10.350 --> 01:13.300
Alright, Blu! You're flying! Sort of.

01:14.850 --> 01:16.100
No, no, Blu. Wait!

01:21.600 --> 01:22.600
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

01:24.450 --> 01:25.350
We're gonna die!

01:49.450 --> 01:50.200
...Rio.

01:52.900 --> 01:55.000
You did not feel it in here!

01:55.800 --> 01:58.850
Easter. In digital 3D.
