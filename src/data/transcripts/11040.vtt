00:02.450 --> 00:05.300
Bright colors stir up active feelings.

00:05.600 --> 00:09.200
For example, the color red can cause people to feel excited.

00:09.750 --> 00:12.700
In fact, red can even make a person feel hungrier.

00:13.150 --> 00:15.150
Yellow can increase energy.

00:15.600 --> 00:21.500
Therefore, a room with strong red and yellow colors would be a good place to eat a lot of food quickly.

00:22.250 --> 00:26.000
On the other hand, darker colors, like blue and green, are peaceful.

00:26.450 --> 00:28.850
The color blue can help people calm down.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.887
So, a blue room can be a good place to study,...

00:32.153 --> 00:34.599
...since people can concentrate more easily.

00:35.050 --> 00:39.500
However, it is easier to nod off in a blue room than in a red one.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.900
The colors of clothes can also affect feelings.

00:43.300 --> 00:47.800
Black and deep blue clothes can produce a sense of strength and seriousness.

00:48.500 --> 00:53.750
Therefore, a person in a black suit can seem like a leader more easily than one wearing white.

00:54.567 --> 00:57.334
If a person is wearing a dark suit and a red tie,...

00:57.637 --> 01:00.698
...he or she may seem both powerful and energetic.

01:01.050 --> 01:06.550
Perhaps this is why many politicians and business people wear dark suits with red ties.

01:07.200 --> 01:10.350
Brown and green clothes can produce a sense of confidence,...

01:10.650 --> 01:14.550
...which means it may seem easier to trust a person wearing such colors.

01:15.350 --> 01:20.150
Therefore, many people choose to wear green or brown clothes for meetings or interviews.

01:20.800 --> 01:25.350
Choice of color, for rooms as well as clothes, is not simply about appearance.
