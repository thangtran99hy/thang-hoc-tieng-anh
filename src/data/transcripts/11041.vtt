Would you be worried if your classmate told you that he was a philatelist?

00:06.900 --> 00:09.700
Would you call a doctor or call the police?

00:10.300 --> 00:12.900
Actually, there is no reason to be concerned.

00:13.450 --> 00:16.700
A philatelist is just a person who collects stamps!

00:17.500 --> 00:21.550
Stamp collecting has been around for well over 150 years.

00:22.150 --> 00:26.250
People began collecting stamps soon after adhesive postage stamps,...

00:26.550 --> 00:28.100
...stamps with glue on the back,...

00:28.400 --> 00:30.650
...were introduced in London in 1840.

00:31.300 --> 00:34.150
Today, according to Boys' Life magazine,...

00:34.500 --> 00:37.750
...stamp collecting is the most practiced hobby in the world.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.600
Some people collect stamps just for fun.

00:41.050 --> 00:45.700
These people may just want to collect stamps with animals or famous people on them...

00:46.400 --> 00:50.500
...or maybe they want to collect all the stamps issued by one particular country.

00:51.100 --> 00:54.900
Other people collect stamps that they think will be valuable down the road.

00:55.500 --> 01:02.000
Such collectors ask three questions to determine if a stamp is worth collecting and what its value might be.

01:02.900 --> 01:06.000
First, how many of a particular stamp were made?

01:06.650 --> 01:08.750
Next, how popular is the stamp?

01:09.350 --> 01:12.050
Finally, what is the condition of the stamp?

01:12.700 --> 01:14.500
If a stamp has a low print run,...

01:14.850 --> 01:16.600
...a popular picture or design...

01:16.850 --> 01:18.400
...and is in excellent condition,...

01:18.800 --> 01:20.850
...this stamp may be worth a lot of money.

01:21.600 --> 01:29.800
In 1980, a one-cent British Guinea stamp issued in 1856 went for $935,000!
