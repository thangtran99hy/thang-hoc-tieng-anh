Movie studios and recording companies are in a constant fight against piracy.

00:08.550 --> 00:10.400
The Internet is the worst culprit.

00:10.850 --> 00:15.950
People often upload or watch pirated material, especially on video-sharing sites.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.800
The companies try to shut down these sites.

00:19.100 --> 00:21.450
They even sue the people using this material.

00:21.750 --> 00:24.250
Still, it has been of little use thus far.

00:24.700 --> 00:28.350
There are just too many people and websites with pirated materials.

00:28.700 --> 00:33.650
As well, these methods are making the studios and companies unpopular with the public.

00:34.050 --> 00:36.500
People are starting to see these companies as greedy.

00:36.900 --> 00:40.700
However, a new kind of software may change the nature of this fight.

00:41.450 --> 00:44.950
Amazingly, it is advertising software that is making a difference.

00:45.400 --> 00:48.800
This new software can actually analyze videos on the Internet.

00:49.250 --> 00:52.450
When it finds a pirated video clip, it doesn't report it.

00:52.800 --> 00:56.050
Instead, it just puts an ad at the bottom of the video.

00:56.350 --> 00:59.800
This is an ad for the original source of the material.

01:00.050 --> 01:04.550
For example, it could show a link to the website of the studio or recording company.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.550
Or, it could show an ad for a product that the company owns.

01:08.950 --> 01:14.100
In this way, each pirated copy would actually help make money for the original company.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.350
If you can't beat them, join them!
