When wealthy people pass away,...

00:04.900 --> 00:09.850
...they usually leave instructions for what to do with the money or property that they leave behind.

00:10.433 --> 00:13.483
Often, the money and property go to their heirs.

00:13.933 --> 00:19.517
However in some cases, rich pet owners leave their wealth to their pets after they die.

00:20.367 --> 00:23.383
For example, there is a poodle named Toby.

00:24.033 --> 00:28.850
When this poodle's owner passed away, she left Toby 15 million pounds,...

00:29.200 --> 00:31.250
...about 25 million dollars.

00:31.967 --> 00:34.717
Then there is Flossie, a yellow Lab mutt,...

00:35.100 --> 00:37.717
...who is not only rich, but is also famous.

00:38.333 --> 00:42.749
In 2001, Flossie made the headlines after she rescued her owner,...

00:43.167 --> 00:47.117
...the actress Drew Barrymore and Drew's husband, from a house fire.

00:47.833 --> 00:50.783
To thank Flossie, Drew gave her house to Flossie.

00:51.533 --> 00:54.450
Of course, Drew repaired the fire damage first.

00:54.967 --> 00:58.950
Now, Flossie is the owner of a beautiful three million-dollar home.

00:59.867 --> 01:03.317
It may seem strange for a dog to own such an expensive home,...

01:03.833 --> 01:06.050
...but Flossie is not the only dog like that.

01:06.933 --> 01:11.164
Gunther IV, a German Shepherd, bought his home from Madonna...

01:11.425 --> 01:14.050
...and paid over seven million dollars for the house.

01:14.533 --> 01:17.017
However, this was no big deal for him...

01:17.333 --> 01:20.617
...because Gunther IV has about 200 million dollars!

01:21.300 --> 01:23.450
This makes him the richest dog in the world.

01:24.067 --> 01:29.117
He inherited the money from his father, who was the heir to the fortune of a German countess.
