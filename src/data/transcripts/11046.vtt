00:28.833 --> 00:30.750
...which was based on a comic book he wrote.

00:31.300 --> 00:33.383

Miyazaki's 2001 movie, "Spirited Away", was even more popular than "Totoro".

01:26.033 --> 01:29.250
However, they still show his ideas about real life.

01:29.967 --> 01:33.050
He often points out how humans hurt the natural world.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.850
He thinks people should change how they live.

01:36.633 --> 01:41.383
Miyazaki's movies combine fantasy and reality in an original way.

01:42.067 --> 01:45.117
This may be why so many people like his movies.
