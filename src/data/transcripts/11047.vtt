00:00.767 --> 00:04.983
This was the place where America remembered what it means to hope.

00:06.433 --> 00:09.450
Hope is that thing inside us that insists...

00:10.100 --> 00:12.383
...despite all the evidence to the contrary,...

00:13.167 --> 00:17.641
...that something better awaits us if we have the courage to reach for it...

00:18.100 --> 00:20.450
...and to work for it, and to fight for it.

00:23.900 --> 00:25.383
And should we win the day,...

00:26.833 --> 00:30.650
...the Fourth of July will no longer be known as an American holiday,...

00:32.367 --> 00:35.050
...but as the day when the world declared in one voice:...

00:35.300 --> 00:37.517
..."We will not go quietly into the night!"

00:38.300 --> 00:40.917
"We will not vanish without a fight!"

00:42.300 --> 00:43.350
"We're going to live on!"

00:44.600 --> 00:45.783
"We're going to survive!"

00:47.267 --> 00:51.050
Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!
