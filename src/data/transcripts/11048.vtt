Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:04.250 --> 00:05.450
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:05.600 --> 00:09.500
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:10.100 --> 00:11.450
Alright, today's Maestro Hook.

00:11.750 --> 00:16.150
A Hook is a good conversation piece you can use when you're talking with a foreigner for a good topic.

00:16.900 --> 00:18.900
Today is about personal questions.

00:19.550 --> 00:23.850
Westerners really like to ask you personal questions and they want to intrude into your life.

00:24.350 --> 00:29.700
For example, your marital status, your age, your job, even maybe your salary.

00:30.100 --> 00:32.600
But it's not rude, this is a cultural thing.

00:33.150 --> 00:36.150
Western people wanna know more about you because they are interested in you.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.500
So, when they ask you this kind of questions, don't be insulted.

00:39.700 --> 00:42.550
You don't have to answer, but there's no harm in answering them.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.600
So, it's just a form of communication, so don't worry about it.

00:45.900 --> 00:47.600
And you can ask the questions too.

00:48.500 --> 00:48.900
Alright.

01:00.800 --> 01:01.200
Private.

01:10.300 --> 01:11.000
Personal.

01:12.500 --> 01:13.450
Personal question.

01:13.850 --> 01:15.250
Can I ask you a personal question?

01:18.850 --> 01:19.650
Personal time.

01:22.300 --> 01:23.050
Personal time.

01:23.150 --> 01:24.750
I need some personal time.

01:25.450 --> 01:27.150
Okay. Personal matter.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.100
That's a personal matter.

01:32.500 --> 01:32.900
Private.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.600
Okay, and...

01:41.250 --> 01:41.950
Out of line.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.200
You are out of line.

01:52.350 --> 01:53.800
I'm sorry, that's out of line.

02:01.400 --> 02:02.050
For example,...

02:03.150 --> 02:05.700
..."Excuse me, can I ask you a personal question?"

02:09.200 --> 02:09.800
"Oh, go ahead!"

02:10.400 --> 02:11.250
"By all means."

02:16.300 --> 02:17.400
"Can I ask you a personal question?"
