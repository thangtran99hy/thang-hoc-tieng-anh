Cosmetics have been used throughout history.

00:05.387 --> 00:09.945
The ancient Greeks, the Egyptians and the Romans all used various kinds of makeup.

00:10.668 --> 00:13.889
Some of these cosmetics were used to improve one's appearance.

00:14.285 --> 00:16.621
Others were used to protect one's skin.

00:17.038 --> 00:21.995
However, in some cases, things used for makeup were dangerous or even deadly!

00:22.797 --> 00:27.211
Skin care treatments including perfumes, lotions and cosmetic masks...

00:27.548 --> 00:30.655
...were used in ancient Egypt by rich and poor alike.

00:31.268 --> 00:34.960
Egyptians also developed some of the earliest sunscreens.

00:35.296 --> 00:40.110
They used oils and creams for protection against the sun and dry winds.

00:40.759 --> 00:43.554
Egyptians, as well as other ancient cultures,...

00:43.831 --> 00:47.025
...used various powders on their skin for beauty as well.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.794
Egyptians used black kohl around their eyes,...

00:51.243 --> 00:53.720
...Romans put white chalk on their faces...

00:54.061 --> 00:56.913
...and Indians painted red henna on their bodies.

00:57.595 --> 01:00.153
Most of the ancient cosmetics were harmless.

01:00.539 --> 01:02.013
However, in the name of beauty,...

01:02.266 --> 01:06.339
...some people applied dangerous chemicals and poisons to their skin.

01:06.937 --> 01:11.551
During the Italian Renaissance, women wore white powder made of lead on their faces.

01:12.100 --> 01:16.354
Of course, doctors today know lead is like a poison for our bodies.

01:16.947 --> 01:18.992
Also around the time of the Renaissance,...

01:19.233 --> 01:22.569
...women in Italy put drops of belladonna in their eyes.

01:22.981 --> 01:25.449
These belladonna drops were made from a plant...

01:25.568 --> 01:28.028
...whose poison affects the nerves in the body.

01:28.706 --> 01:33.662
By putting belladonna drops in her eyes, a woman's pupils would become very large.

01:34.090 --> 01:36.100
People thought this made women more beautiful.

01:36.588 --> 01:39.305
Actually, this is where the plant's name comes from.

01:39.659 --> 01:42.511
In Italian, belladonna means "beautiful woman."

01:43.375 --> 01:46.511
When Elizabeth I was queen in the late 1500s,...

01:46.782 --> 01:51.047
...some rather dangerous cosmetics were also being used by women in England.

01:51.559 --> 01:56.060
In particular, women were using special hair dye made with lead and sulphur.

01:56.623 --> 01:59.347
The dye was designed to give people red hair,...

01:59.610 --> 02:01.257
...the same color as the queen's hair.

02:01.646 --> 02:04.755
But over time, the dye made people's hair fall out.

02:05.231 --> 02:10.597
Finally, women using this dye ended up bald like the queen and had to wear wigs.
