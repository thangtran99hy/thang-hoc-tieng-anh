00:00.430 --> 00:05.840
So, Wolfy stands outside the house of Piggy number three and they assume their battle positions.

00:06.500 --> 00:07.240
"Let me in!"

00:07.440 --> 00:08.270
"No, no!"

00:09.240 --> 00:10.310
"I'll huff and I'll puff!"

00:10.410 --> 00:11.440
"Go away!"

00:12.410 --> 00:15.140
"Okay, you 'axed' for it Piggy!"

00:16.650 --> 00:18.780
Wolfy is huffing.

00:20.690 --> 00:21.780
And Wolfy is puffing.

00:25.220 --> 00:29.180
Nothing. This is a brick house, they do not blow over so easy.

00:29.730 --> 00:33.160
So, Wolfy gets himself a ladder, climbs up onto the roof.

00:33.670 --> 00:36.870
Piggy sees him climb onto the roof. Wolfy makes for the chimney.

00:37.400 --> 00:41.800
Piggy lights a fire in the grate. Wolfy goes down the chimney, he burns.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.340
Wolfy burns.

00:46.070 --> 00:48.580
Wolfy burns and Piggy lives.

00:49.610 --> 00:50.710
Happily ever after.
