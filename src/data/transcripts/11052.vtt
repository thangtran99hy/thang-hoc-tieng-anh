Different cultures follow their own special customs when a child's baby teeth fall out.

00:08.247 --> 00:09.724
In Korea, for example,...

00:10.100 --> 00:14.260
...they have the custom of throwing lost teeth up on the roof of a house.

00:14.611 --> 00:18.338
According to tradition, a magpie will come and take the tooth.

00:18.719 --> 00:22.199
Later, the magpie will return with a new tooth for the child.

00:22.779 --> 00:26.077
In other Asian countries such as Japan and Vietnam,...

00:26.395 --> 00:31.361
...children follow a similar tradition of throwing lost teeth onto the roofs of houses.

00:32.005 --> 00:34.927
Birds aren't the only animals thought to take lost teeth.

00:35.315 --> 00:40.838
In Mexico and Spain, tradition says a mouse takes a lost tooth and leaves some money.

00:41.339 --> 00:47.140
However in Mongolia, instead of mice, dogs are responsible for taking teeth away.

00:47.757 --> 00:50.555
Dogs are highly respected in Mongolian culture...

00:50.895 --> 00:53.451
...and are considered guardian angels of the people.

00:53.962 --> 00:57.813
Tradition says that the new tooth will grow in good and strong...

00:57.989 --> 01:00.788
...if the baby tooth is fed to a guardian angel.

01:01.305 --> 01:05.713
Accordingly, parents in Mongolia will put their child's lost tooth...

01:05.817 --> 01:07.345
...in the fat of a piece of meat...

01:07.626 --> 01:08.939
...and feed it to a dog.

01:09.609 --> 01:14.947
The idea of giving lost teeth to an angel or fairy is also a tradition in the West.

01:15.522 --> 01:18.769
Many children in Western countries count on the Tooth Fairy...

01:18.842 --> 01:22.321
...to leave money or presents in exchange for a tooth.

01:22.717 --> 01:25.640
The exact origins of the Tooth Fairy are a mystery,...

01:26.079 --> 01:30.425
...although the story probably began in England or Ireland centuries ago.

01:30.885 --> 01:32.197
According to tradition,...

01:32.431 --> 01:36.530
...a child puts a lost tooth under his or her pillow before going to bed.

01:37.058 --> 01:39.671
In the wee hours while the child is sleeping,...

01:40.051 --> 01:43.839
...the Tooth Fairy takes the tooth and leaves something else under the pillow.

01:44.393 --> 01:48.058
In France, the Tooth Fairy leaves a small gift or candy.

01:48.630 --> 01:52.543
In the United States however, the Tooth Fairy usually leaves money.

01:53.189 --> 01:57.101
These days, the rate is $1 to $5 per tooth.

01:57.392 --> 02:00.499
That can add up to a lot of money from the Tooth Fairy!
