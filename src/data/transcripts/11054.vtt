The Ring of Fire is an enormous chain of volcanoes all around the Pacific Ocean.

00:07.978 --> 00:12.171
The Ring goes from New Zealand up to Asia and across the ocean to Alaska.

00:12.964 --> 00:15.124
From Alaska, the Ring continues southward...

00:15.197 --> 00:17.893
...along the coast of both North and South America.

00:18.611 --> 00:23.191
More than seventy-five percent of the world's volcanoes are located in this ring.

00:24.193 --> 00:27.011
Scientists are interested in studying the Ring of Fire...

00:27.097 --> 00:29.984
...because they can observe plate tectonics at work there.

00:30.675 --> 00:33.490
In 1912, a German scientist, Alfred Wegener,...

00:33.811 --> 00:36.335
...came up with the first theory of land movement.

00:37.009 --> 00:41.487
Wegener said continents are made up of lighter rocks resting on heavier material.

00:42.323 --> 00:45.688
Similar to the way large things move while floating on water,...

00:45.998 --> 00:49.577
...Wegener suggested that the positions of the continents were not fixed,...

00:49.928 --> 00:51.521
...but that they moved slightly.

00:52.262 --> 00:56.457
Later, scientists discovered most of Wegener's ideas were right on the mark.

00:57.055 --> 01:00.046
They then developed the theory called plate tectonics.

01:00.688 --> 01:03.395
According to plate tectonics, the surface of the Earth...

01:03.498 --> 01:06.963
...consists of a number of enormous plates or sections of rock,...

01:07.479 --> 01:09.178
...each about eighty kilometers thick.

01:09.966 --> 01:15.223
The plates float and slowly move at speeds between one to ten centimeters every year.

01:15.836 --> 01:18.020
That is about the rate your fingernails grow!

01:18.543 --> 01:23.724
Within the Ring of Fire, new material for the Earth's plates is constantly being created...

01:23.874 --> 01:28.957
...as hot liquid rock called magma flows from the center of the Earth up to the ocean floor.

01:29.842 --> 01:32.145
All the existing plates on the Earth's surface...

01:32.225 --> 01:35.035
...have to move slightly to make room for the new material.

01:35.933 --> 01:40.014
As plates move both away from and toward each other, they run into each other.

01:40.757 --> 01:43.980
When they hit each other, one plate might move under another.

01:44.531 --> 01:46.793
This process is called subduction.

01:47.377 --> 01:49.726
Subduction frequently causes earthquakes.

01:50.376 --> 01:52.837
It may also result in the bottom plate melting...

01:53.114 --> 01:55.779
...due to the extreme temperatures under the top plate.

01:56.585 --> 02:00.280
The magma created in this process can rise to the Earth's surface...

02:00.663 --> 02:02.414
...and come out through volcanoes,...

02:02.718 --> 02:04.867
...as can be seen along the Ring of Fire.
