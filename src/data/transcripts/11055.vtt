00:03.033 --> 00:05.316
Almost everybody has had acne.

00:05.900 --> 00:11.050
Acne, also known as pimples or zits, is a normal part of growing up.

00:11.567 --> 00:15.483
When kids reach puberty, their bodies experience many changes.

00:15.967 --> 00:19.250
As the levels of hormones in teenager's bodies change,...

00:19.767 --> 00:21.883
...teenagers frequently develop pimples.

00:22.433 --> 00:26.317
Additionally, many people continue to have pimples after puberty.

00:26.833 --> 00:30.383
What can a teenager or an adult do to cure pimples?

00:30.967 --> 00:36.583
Unfortunately, many cures people think will work on pimples are really just myths.

00:37.233 --> 00:41.117
Many people believe that popping pimples is the best way to get rid of them.

00:41.833 --> 00:45.783
Popping a pimple will actually push the germs further under the skin,...

00:46.200 --> 00:50.317
...which can cause more redness and pain, or even turn into an infection.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.937
For that reason, doctors who specialize in skin problems...

00:54.287 --> 00:57.050
...normally encourage people not to pop their pimples.

00:57.567 --> 01:01.817
Also, do you think that washing your face frequently will help get rid of pimples?

01:02.233 --> 01:05.050
Of course, washing your face is a good idea,...

01:05.500 --> 01:10.983
...but washing your face too much could irritate the skin more, making the pimples even worse.

01:11.600 --> 01:17.983
Another widely believed myth is that not wearing makeup can help reduce a person's chance of developing pimples.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.571
In fact, some kinds of makeup or face creams...

01:21.829 --> 01:24.950
...actually have special medicine in them to fight pimples.

01:25.533 --> 01:27.983
As a result, not all of them are bad for you.

01:28.533 --> 01:33.450
Along with makeup, people claim that eating fatty foods or chocolate can cause acne.

01:34.100 --> 01:38.583
The truth is that eating a candy bar or a piece of pizza will not cause pimples.

01:39.167 --> 01:43.567
Even so, both teenagers and adults should still try to eat foods...

01:43.641 --> 01:46.050
...that are good for their bodies and their skin.

01:46.933 --> 01:49.317
Another myth is that stress can cause acne.

01:49.967 --> 01:55.250
Stress comes in many forms, like a big exam at school or problems with friends.

01:55.767 --> 01:59.850
While it is true that stress can cause a person's skin to create extra oil,...

02:00.333 --> 02:03.783
...this extra oil does not necessarily cause more pimples.
