What has been the biggest challenge that you've had to face in your skating career?

00:04.920 --> 00:12.240
I think last year is one of the hardest obstacles that I've overcome...

00:12.359 --> 00:17.407
...in that, I was injured and I was being a teenager and rebellious.

00:17.627 --> 00:21.179
And everything combined wasn't good for me, but...

00:22.369 --> 00:24.367
...I think I've been able to overcome that.

00:24.443 --> 00:28.586
So this year, I'm gonna be even harder on myself and push myself to reach my dream.

00:29.041 --> 00:30.743
What are you hoping for in 2010?

00:31.991 --> 00:33.513
Well, definitely,...

00:33.585 --> 00:35.137
...I would love to go to the Olympics...

00:35.201 --> 00:37.608
...and it would be an honor to represent my country,...

00:38.575 --> 00:39.839
...but in the long run...

00:39.957 --> 00:44.229
...if I do all the best I can in my training every day,...

00:44.584 --> 00:46.691
...I think I'll be satisfied with any result.

00:47.529 --> 00:48.927
Well, thank you so much for talking to us today.

00:51.379 --> 00:51.990
Thank you!

00:52.206 --> 00:54.462
I'm Ella Morton and you've been watching Rocketboom.
