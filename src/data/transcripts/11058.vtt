00:02.600 --> 00:05.300
To toot, to cut the cheese, or to fart...

00:05.450 --> 00:09.950
...are all funny ways to talk about something that everyone does: passing gas.

00:10.550 --> 00:13.950
A normal person passes about half a liter of gas a day,...

00:14.300 --> 00:16.650
...which equals about 14 farts per day.

00:17.300 --> 00:21.700
Lots of people are embarrassed by passing gas, but there is no need to feel this way.

00:22.100 --> 00:24.550
The first step is to admit that everyone does it.

00:25.033 --> 00:26.616
After you face up to this fact,...

00:26.688 --> 00:30.508
...then you can really enjoy learning some interesting facts about your gas.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.200
There are several sources of gas.

00:33.500 --> 00:39.600
Gas in our intestines has to do with both the air we swallow and the gas molecules in our blood.

00:40.050 --> 00:45.900
In addition, gas is also produced from chemical reactions and bacteria living in our intestines.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.700
Nervous people usually have more gas for two reasons.

00:50.100 --> 00:52.400
They swallow more air when they get nervous...

00:52.700 --> 00:56.300
...and food usually goes through their digestive systems faster,...

00:56.650 --> 01:00.450
...which means that the oxygen in the food cannot be absorbed quickly enough.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
Therefore, the oxygen naturally found in the food goes into the intestines and becomes gas.

01:06.800 --> 01:12.350
Another interesting fact is that a person's diet affects the stinkiness of his or her gas.

01:12.967 --> 01:14.713
Foods with a lot of sulfur in them,...

01:14.926 --> 01:18.839
...such as eggs, meat, and cauliflower cause stinkier gas.

01:19.300 --> 01:21.950
On the other hand, beans cause a lot of gas,...

01:22.200 --> 01:26.250
...but this gas isn't usually stinky because beans aren't high in sulfur.

01:26.700 --> 01:31.400
However, they do contain a lot of sugars that bacteria in the intestines love.

01:31.900 --> 01:34.350
The bacteria eat the sugars and produce gas.

01:34.950 --> 01:38.550
Finally, people wonder, "Where does gas go when you hold it in?"

01:38.950 --> 01:40.700
"Is this held gas harmful?"

01:41.350 --> 01:43.200
Well, this gas will not poison you,...

01:43.550 --> 01:46.150
...but you may get a bad stomachache from the pressure.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.600
The gas that you hold in is neither released nor absorbed.

01:49.900 --> 01:54.100
It moves back up into the intestines and sooner or later comes out.

01:54.450 --> 01:56.500
It is not lost, just delayed.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.400
Now that you know some facts about gas,...

01:59.700 --> 02:03.150
...be proud of yourself and say, "Yes, I cut the cheese!"
