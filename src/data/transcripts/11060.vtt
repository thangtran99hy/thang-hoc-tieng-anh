00:03.133 --> 00:05.650
People think children should play sports.

00:06.033 --> 00:09.850
Sports are fun and children stay healthy while playing with others.

00:10.233 --> 00:13.717
However, playing sports can have negative effects on children.

00:14.233 --> 00:19.250
It may produce feelings of poor self-esteem or aggressive behavior in some children.

00:19.833 --> 00:22.450
According to research on kids and sports,...

00:22.833 --> 00:25.383
...40 million kids play sports in the US.

00:25.833 --> 00:31.050
Of these, 18 million say they have been yelled at or called names while playing sports.

00:31.700 --> 00:34.883
This leaves many children with a bad impression of sports.

00:35.233 --> 00:37.517
They think sports are just too aggressive.

00:38.367 --> 00:41.950
Many researchers believe adults, especially parents and coaches,...

00:42.200 --> 00:45.683
...are the main cause of too much aggression in children's sports.

00:46.233 --> 00:49.450
They believe children copy aggressive adult behavior.

00:50.100 --> 00:54.917
This behavior is then further reinforced through both positive and negative feedback.

00:55.633 --> 01:00.183
Parents and coaches are powerful teachers because children usually look up to them.

01:00.833 --> 01:03.583
Often these adults behave aggressively themselves,...

01:03.833 --> 01:06.700
...sending children the message that winning is everything.

01:07.367 --> 01:11.315
At children's sporting events, parents may yell insults at other players...

01:11.406 --> 01:13.983
...or cheer when their child behaves aggressively.

01:14.700 --> 01:18.217
As well, children may be taught that hurting other players is acceptable...

01:18.533 --> 01:22.317
...or they may be pushed to continue playing even when they are injured.

01:22.833 --> 01:25.850
In addition, the media makes violence seem exciting.

01:26.567 --> 01:32.183
Children watch adult sports games and see violent behavior replayed over and over on television.

01:33.167 --> 01:37.583
As a society, we really need to face up to this problem and do something about it.

01:38.133 --> 01:41.717
Parents and coaches should act as better examples for children.

01:42.300 --> 01:44.483
They also need to teach children better values.

01:44.967 --> 01:48.717
They should teach children to enjoy themselves whether they win or not.

01:49.267 --> 01:52.850
It is not necessary to knock yourself out to enjoy sports.

01:53.367 --> 01:54.650
Winning is not everything.

01:55.267 --> 01:59.583
In addition, children should not be allowed to continue to play when they are injured.

02:00.067 --> 02:06.583
Sending a child with an injury into a game gives the child the message that health is not as important as winning.

02:07.100 --> 02:11.583
If we make some basic changes, children might learn to enjoy sports again.
