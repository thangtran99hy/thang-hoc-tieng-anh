Let's talk about the movie "Public Enemies".

00:07.170 --> 00:08.200
It's a great story,...

00:08.350 --> 00:11.770
...and I think there was an era in this country when this was fairly common.

00:12.200 --> 00:13.980
After the depression, early 30s,...

00:14.210 --> 00:19.450
...we had outlaws who became folk heroes and this is about John Dillinger and his buddies.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.150
I saw the movie the other night and really enjoyed it. It's fantastic.

00:23.740 --> 00:26.860
I like it because historically, it's the real deal, you know?

00:27.260 --> 00:28.560
And then have you seen the movie?

00:28.890 --> 00:29.490
No, I have not.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.030
I'm sorry, you've not seen the movie?

00:33.130 --> 00:33.730
Not just yet.

00:36.530 --> 00:37.800
You're too busy to see it probably?

00:40.200 --> 00:45.550
You know, in a way, once my job is done on a film, it's really none of my business.

00:50.980 --> 00:51.950
Really, none of your business?

00:57.640 --> 01:00.460
So, you deliberately don't look at the finished product?

01:00.560 --> 01:02.460
Oh yeah, I stay as far away as I possibly can.

01:02.560 --> 01:03.130
Is that right?

01:03.230 --> 01:03.530
Yeah.

01:04.630 --> 01:08.860
If I can, I'd try to stay in as profound a state of ignorance as possible.

01:09.970 --> 01:11.030
Well, you've come to the right place.

01:13.270 --> 01:14.710
You're exactly where you need to be.
