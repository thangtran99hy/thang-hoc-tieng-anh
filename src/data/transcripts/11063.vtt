Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:03.809 --> 00:04.847
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:05.293 --> 00:08.081
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.294
So today's Maestro Hook,...

00:10.828 --> 00:13.902
...a good conversation piece you can use with foreigners is about food.

00:14.495 --> 00:15.559
So in a cafeteria,...

00:16.936 --> 00:19.737
...when you take a Westerner out to dinner or when a foreigner comes...

00:19.801 --> 00:21.141
...and you wanna take them out to good food,...

00:21.573 --> 00:23.231
...there's a little few things you might wanna worry about.

00:24.151 --> 00:28.445
Western people aren't really comfortable with putting all your chopsticks into one dish,...

00:28.525 --> 00:31.091
...so maybe you wanna avoid something like a Japanese nabe.

00:31.985 --> 00:37.330
You wanna make sure that you can eat each piece and don't get so involved with using chopsticks together.

00:38.277 --> 00:42.360
And also, when you say "raw food" like "raw sushi" or "raw fish",...

00:42.765 --> 00:46.754
...the word "raw" in English sounds very strong and it sounds very, very raw.

00:47.142 --> 00:48.599
So, don't use the word "raw"...

00:48.857 --> 00:52.694
...and use the word "fresh" like "fresh fish" or "fresh vegetables".

00:53.103 --> 00:54.641
Not raw vegetables, okay?

00:55.437 --> 00:55.660
Alright.

00:56.114 --> 00:57.266
So, Maestro Menu.

01:05.634 --> 01:06.064
I like...

01:10.223 --> 01:11.437
I'm a big fan of...

01:12.637 --> 01:14.459
I'm a big fan of sukiyaki.

01:15.309 --> 01:17.119
I'm a big fan of boiled food.

01:25.257 --> 01:25.624
I hate...

01:26.217 --> 01:26.743
I don't like...

01:28.785 --> 01:31.195
I'm not so crazy about sushi.

01:31.851 --> 01:33.688
I'm not so crazy about sukiyaki.

01:37.755 --> 01:39.708
I'm not a big fan of sushi.

01:41.786 --> 01:43.303
I'm crazy about chocolate.

01:45.653 --> 01:45.863
So...

01:51.711 --> 01:52.853
Okay, Maestro Lines.

01:55.690 --> 01:57.129
Would you like some tofu?

01:57.875 --> 02:00.112
Oh! You know what, I'm not so crazy about tofu.

02:00.541 --> 02:01.607
Oh! Okay. No problem.

02:03.527 --> 02:05.815
Would you like some half-boiled eggs?

02:06.063 --> 02:07.856
Oh! I'm crazy about eggs.

02:09.461 --> 02:10.734
I'm a big fan of eggs.

02:14.792 --> 02:18.835
Alright.

02:19.588 --> 02:19.842
So when you're eating, make sure you have a lot of expressions 'cause eating is fun.

02:20.038 --> 02:22.131
Alright.

02:22.295 --> 02:24.781
So, see you next week again on Native Maestro...

02:25.421 --> 02:25.731
...and there's more English to help you become the native maestro.

02:25.350 --> 02:25.700
Bye-bye!
