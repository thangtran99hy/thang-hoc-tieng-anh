00:02.900 --> 00:05.900
Is there a famous person whom you really admire?

00:06.450 --> 00:08.750
Wouldn't you love to have his or her autograph?

00:09.250 --> 00:14.550
You would never throw that person's autograph away because of your admiration for him or her.

00:15.100 --> 00:19.700
However, some people collect autographs even from people they don't admire.

00:20.300 --> 00:23.200
They just want autographs from any famous person.

00:23.900 --> 00:28.450
Rather than collecting these autographs to keep, they collect the autographs to sell.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.408
These days, there are more than 20,000 people who collect autographs...

00:33.501 --> 00:36.279
...for the value the autographs might have in the future.

00:36.850 --> 00:40.200
Since these people are willing to pay a lot of money for an autograph,...

00:40.650 --> 00:44.550
...autograph hounds now hang around sport centers, concert arenas,...

00:44.850 --> 00:48.300
...and chic restaurants trying to get autographs they can sell.

00:48.800 --> 00:53.600
They can sometimes make as much as $1,500 for one autograph.

00:54.150 --> 00:59.800
In fact, one very successful autograph hound earns about $100,000 a year.

01:00.650 --> 01:03.450
There are also companies that buy and sell autographs.

01:04.033 --> 01:06.902
One company, Profiles in History, says...

01:06.987 --> 01:10.367
...it has the largest collection of entertainer's autographs in the world...

01:10.650 --> 01:13.400
...and earns more than 12 million dollars a year.

01:14.100 --> 01:17.550
Some autographs from this company may cost under $100,...

01:18.000 --> 01:20.450
...but others can cost several thousand dollars.

01:21.300 --> 01:24.450
The price of an autograph depends on how rare the autograph is.

01:24.900 --> 01:31.050
For example, famous people like Angelina Jolie and George Clooney sign a lot of autographs.

01:31.500 --> 01:35.700
Therefore, their autographs are not rare and are not worth very much money.

01:36.350 --> 01:40.650
On the other hand, Madonna and Nicole Kidman rarely sign anything.

01:41.250 --> 01:44.100
This makes their autographs rarer and more valuable.

01:44.900 --> 01:47.800
Queen Elizabeth II almost never signs autographs,...

01:48.250 --> 01:53.550
...therefore, something with her signature on it might sell for around $3,500.

01:54.200 --> 01:56.100
It doesn't matter if the person is dead.

01:56.750 --> 01:59.800
Elvis Presley and Napoleon signed many things.

02:00.350 --> 02:03.450
Their signatures are only worth $1,500.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.700
However, signed letters from Marilyn Monroe are very rare.

02:08.250 --> 02:10.650
They can cost $50,000 each.

02:11.467 --> 02:16.568
The highest price ever paid for an autograph was $750,000...

02:16.818 --> 02:19.740
...for a letter written and signed by Abraham Lincoln.
