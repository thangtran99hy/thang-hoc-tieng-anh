00:00.600 --> 00:02.150
Equality for Africa,...

00:03.400 --> 00:06.300
...that's a big, expensive idea.

00:07.700 --> 00:11.000
You see, the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference.

00:11.750 --> 00:15.600
What on earth can we all do about this?

00:17.050 --> 00:18.600
Well, much more than we think.

00:19.050 --> 00:23.350
We can't fix every problem, but the ones we can, I want to argue, we must.

00:23.900 --> 00:26.200
And because we can, we must.

00:28.400 --> 00:32.450
This is the straight truth. The righteous truth.

00:33.300 --> 00:33.950
It is not a theory.

00:34.900 --> 00:37.802
The fact is that ours is the first generation...

00:38.215 --> 00:41.295
...that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye,...

00:41.850 --> 00:45.450
...look across the ocean to Africa and say this, and mean it,...

00:46.300 --> 00:48.350
..."We do not have to stand for this."

00:48.700 --> 00:50.350
A whole continent written off,...

00:50.850 --> 00:53.400
..."we do not have to stand for this".
