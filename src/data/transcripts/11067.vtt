These days, it is easy for most of us to get a hold of the latest books or magazines.

00:07.950 --> 00:13.700
We can go to bookstores, order them through the Internet, or borrow them from the local library.

00:14.300 --> 00:20.350
Now, imagine having to walk miles and miles through a hot sandy desert just to borrow a book.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.950
This is the reality for people living in the villages of the Garissa region of Kenya in East Africa.

00:27.450 --> 00:33.850
In 1996, librarian Wycliffe Oluoch used to spend each day waiting for people to come...

00:34.150 --> 00:38.400
...to borrow some of the 24,000 books in his library in Garissa.

00:39.150 --> 00:43.350
The library had no shortage of books, but people weren't coming to read them.

00:44.050 --> 00:48.100
It was too much effort to walk through the desert just to borrow books.

00:48.750 --> 00:52.800
Oluoch racked his brain for ways to entice people into the library.

00:53.400 --> 00:56.500
After a lot of thought, he hit upon a great idea.

00:57.050 --> 01:01.900
If people wouldn't come to the library, then he would have to take the library to them.

01:02.550 --> 01:08.900
Oluoch strapped boxes of books onto the backs of camels, and created the Mobile Camel Library.

01:09.650 --> 01:15.500
Starting with three camels in 1996, but more recently expanding the service to six camels,...

01:15.900 --> 01:19.500
...the Mobile Camel Library serves over one million people.

01:20.200 --> 01:25.900
Twice a month, the camel library can be seen carrying books all around the Garissa region.

01:26.550 --> 01:33.400
These hardworking animals need little water and can carry up to 500 pounds of books across the sands.

01:34.100 --> 01:40.200
A librarian, a library assistant, a herdsman, and a lookout all travel with the camels.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.250
The lookout helps protect the books from thieves.

01:43.850 --> 01:48.500
The children of Garissa love the camel library and appreciate Oluoch's effort.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.850
Eleven-year-old Mohamud Mohamed reads his library books carefully and always returns them on time.

01:55.450 --> 02:00.950
He knows the Garissa library punishes people for losing books, just like any other library.

02:01.650 --> 02:06.250
However, the punishment is very stiff compared to that of other libraries.

02:06.700 --> 02:10.750
If a village loses a book, the camel library stops visiting.
