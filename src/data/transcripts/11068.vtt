William Shakespeare (1564-1616) wrote many plays and poems,...

00:08.711 --> 00:10.084
...which are known the world over.

00:10.400 --> 00:14.800
But perhaps you think the works of an Elizabethan playwright are not important today.

00:15.300 --> 00:16.150
Well, think again.

00:16.550 --> 00:19.700
Shakespeare's works have survived the years and then some!

00:20.200 --> 00:25.800
For example, "Romeo and Juliet" has not only been performed again and again in theaters around the world,...

00:26.150 --> 00:29.800
...but it has also been made into a very popular movie, twice!

00:30.789 --> 00:32.751
During the late 1500s, however,...

00:32.968 --> 00:36.757
...Shakespeare's plays were often performed at the Globe Theater in London.

00:37.200 --> 00:41.250
The Globe was a large, open-air theater that used only natural lighting.

00:41.800 --> 00:44.250
Shows at the Globe used very few props,...

00:44.500 --> 00:47.100
...but performances were always interesting and exciting,...

00:47.200 --> 00:50.950
...because the audience yelled at, cheered, and talked with the performers.

00:51.650 --> 00:53.300
The Globe was a great success.

00:53.700 --> 00:58.000
However, in 1613, during a performance of Shakespeare's "Henry the Eighth",...

00:58.200 --> 01:01.200
...a cannon was fired on stage, setting off a fire.

01:01.650 --> 01:03.900
The fire completely destroyed the theater.

01:04.550 --> 01:08.150
The Globe was fixed a year later, but it did not stay open long.

01:08.550 --> 01:12.400
The theater was closed by the Puritans, who did not approve of entertainment.

01:12.850 --> 01:17.350
The Globe never opened again and the building was finally torn down in 1644.

01:18.150 --> 01:20.600
Theater lovers in England never forgot the Globe.

01:20.750 --> 01:26.300
And in 1970, a decision was made to rebuild it as close to the original design as possible.

01:26.950 --> 01:29.700
Imagine how people felt when, in 1989,...

01:29.950 --> 01:36.900
...those working on the new Globe came across some of the original building only about 100 meters from the new theater.

01:37.500 --> 01:41.200
They were building the new theater almost in the original Globe's location!

01:41.900 --> 01:48.850
The new Globe opened in 1999 and has since won many awards as one of the best tourist attractions in Europe.

01:49.700 --> 01:51.170
Since the new theater opened,...

01:51.358 --> 01:54.987
...hundreds of thousands of people have attended Shakespearean performances...

01:54.950 --> 01:58.950
...such as "A Midsummer Night's Dream", "As You Like It", and "Henry the Fifth".

01:59.500 --> 02:01.100
Shakespeare, where are you now?

02:01.450 --> 02:02.600
At the Globe, of course!
