I'm here to say, as a professor of mathematics,...

00:03.229 --> 00:07.574
...that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious,...

00:07.676 --> 00:09.938
...,meaningful way in their day-to-day lives.

00:10.291 --> 00:12.285
On the other hand, statistics:...

00:12.589 --> 00:17.557
...that's a subject that you could, and should use on a daily basis, right?

00:17.890 --> 00:18.513
It's risk.

00:18.605 --> 00:19.491
It's reward.

00:19.555 --> 00:20.435
It's randomness. 

00:20.538 --> 00:22.017
It's understanding data.

00:22.382 --> 00:26.860
I think if our students, if our high school students, if all of the American citizens,...

00:27.166 --> 00:29.203
...knew about probability and statistics,...

00:29.477 --> 00:32.057
...we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today.

00:33.141 --> 00:34.099
Not only, thank you.

00:34.317 --> 00:39.039
Not only that, if it's taught properly, it can be a lot of fun.

00:39.319 --> 00:44.017
I mean, probability and statistics, it's the mathematics of games and gambling.

00:44.763 --> 00:46.530
It's analyzing trends.

00:46.612 --> 00:48.040
It's predicting the future.

00:48.797 --> 00:53.365
Look, the world has changed from analog to digital.

00:53.721 --> 00:58.825
And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital.

00:59.393 --> 01:05.473
From the more classical, continuous mathematics to the more modern, discrete mathematics.

01:05.534 --> 01:12.569
The mathematics of uncertainty, of randomness, of data, and that being probability and statistics.

01:12.952 --> 01:17.345
In summary, instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus,...

01:17.643 --> 01:20.310
...I think it would be far more significant...

01:20.578 --> 01:25.335
...if all of them knew what "two standard deviations from the mean" means.

01:25.620 --> 01:26.278
And I mean it.

01:26.672 --> 01:27.381
Thank you very much.
