Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:04.100 --> 00:05.250
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:05.633 --> 00:08.583
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:09.433 --> 00:11.116
So, today's Maestro Hook.

00:11.433 --> 00:14.319
Now remember, the Hook is a good conversation piece...

00:14.383 --> 00:16.717
...that you can use with people when you're talking,...

00:16.967 --> 00:19.650
...when you run out of topics, or you need a good topic to talk about.

00:20.233 --> 00:23.517
So, today is about the Western cultures of surprises.

00:24.767 --> 00:26.717
Western people love surprises...

00:27.100 --> 00:30.183
...whether it's playing a joke or whether it's a surprise party.

00:30.567 --> 00:31.337
When you think about it,...

00:31.841 --> 00:35.450
...in Japanese, there is no direct translation for the word "surprise party."

00:35.947 --> 00:37.117
It's in katakana, right?

00:37.867 --> 00:41.250
So also, Western people love to play jokes on people.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.583
They make a quick remark that's really funny...

00:43.966 --> 00:45.717
...and you need a good response to come back.

00:46.033 --> 00:47.717
So today, I'm gonna teach you something like that.

01:13.300 --> 01:14.450
You had me going.

01:15.500 --> 01:16.717
Oh! You had me going.

01:26.267 --> 01:27.517
Oh! You had me going.

01:32.933 --> 01:33.650
And next,...

01:43.567 --> 01:44.717
You take me for a fool?

01:47.053 --> 01:48.983
Oh, come on! You take me for a fool?

01:58.900 --> 02:00.583
Now, the Maestro Lines.

02:04.833 --> 02:08.317
Hey! I'm gonna go back to America and never come back to Japan.

02:08.933 --> 02:09.383
Really?

02:09.767 --> 02:10.583
No, just kidding.

02:11.767 --> 02:13.517
Oh! You had me going.

02:15.700 --> 02:16.350
And the next one.

02:19.800 --> 02:20.383
What is that?

02:20.867 --> 02:21.717
Oh! That's a rock.

02:22.133 --> 02:23.317
We eat rocks in this country.

02:24.067 --> 02:26.083
Oh, come on! You take me for a fool?

02:35.567 --> 02:39.317
Alright. There'll be more topics next week and hope to see you again.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.650
See you later and this was Native Maestro.

02:41.733 --> 02:42.250
See you later!
