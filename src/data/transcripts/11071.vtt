Would it be possible to get some tips from you for calling customers?

00:07.540 --> 00:11.670
Sure, I can show you the plan I use when I call customers.

00:12.110 --> 00:15.010
You prepare everything you're going to say before you call?

00:15.440 --> 00:18.480
No. But I have an outline I follow for calls.

00:19.150 --> 00:23.550
If it is a "cold call", I greet the customer and identify myself,...

00:23.790 --> 00:26.220
...then I tell them the reason for my call.

00:26.590 --> 00:29.330
You don't start the conversation with small talk?

00:29.660 --> 00:35.100
No. I get to the point by politely asking if they are interested. It saves time.

00:35.640 --> 00:38.630
Do you ever leave messages for people on their voice mail?

00:39.000 --> 00:44.840
Not usually. And if I get a busy signal, I call that person again later in the day.
