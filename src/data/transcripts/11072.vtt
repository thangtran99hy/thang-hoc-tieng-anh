00:02.633 --> 00:08.450
When naming a child, some parents seem to choose a name based simply on their personal preference.

00:08.833 --> 00:14.050
In other families, grandparents or professional name-makers come up with a child's name.

00:14.533 --> 00:19.817
And in some cases, the time of a child's birth influences how the child's name is determined.

00:20.367 --> 00:24.450
In many European cultures, names are typically chosen by parents.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.983
Parents' choice for their child's name...

00:27.200 --> 00:31.950
...may be based on names of relatives or ancestors within their particular family.

00:32.633 --> 00:36.983
For example, in Italy, children are traditionally named after their grandparents.

00:37.667 --> 00:40.783
The parents generally use the father's parents' names first.

00:41.267 --> 00:44.916
If they have more children, then they will use the mother's parents' names.

00:45.500 --> 00:50.450
Similarly, some people in Eastern Europe name their children after relatives who have died.

00:51.100 --> 00:55.117
This tradition is seen as a means to protect the child from the Angel of Death.

00:55.533 --> 00:57.650
Traditionally in some Asian countries,...

00:58.000 --> 01:02.250
...a child's grandfather or a fortune-teller chooses the child's name.

01:02.967 --> 01:06.517
In contrast to the tradition of naming children after relatives,...

01:06.900 --> 01:10.117
...the child's name is chosen to influence the child's character.

01:10.767 --> 01:14.450
For example, names may be based on a connection to certain elements...

01:14.733 --> 01:18.450
...such as fire, water, earth, wood, or metal.

01:19.167 --> 01:23.983
Or the name might include a written character meaning beauty, strength, or kindness.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.363
In certain African cultures,...

01:26.747 --> 01:30.649
...when a child is born plays a large part in determining the child's name.

01:31.267 --> 01:36.050
In Ghana's Akan culture, the day a child is born determines the child's name.

01:36.567 --> 01:39.383
But each day has different names for boys and girls.

01:39.900 --> 01:43.450
For instance, a boy born on Friday is named Kofi,...

01:43.900 --> 01:46.900
...whereas a girl born on the same day is named Afua.

01:47.633 --> 01:52.983
Both Kofi and Afua are names meaning "wanderer" or "explorer".

01:53.600 --> 01:56.150
Children with these names are seen as travelers.

01:56.967 --> 02:01.450
No matter where the name comes from, a child's name is the first gift in life.

02:02.100 --> 02:05.850
Whether it is chosen according to preference or dictated by tradition,...

02:06.333 --> 02:08.783
...the name reflects something about a child's culture.

02:09.433 --> 02:13.117
For that reason, all names should be treasured and respected.
