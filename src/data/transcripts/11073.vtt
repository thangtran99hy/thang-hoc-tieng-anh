00:02.015 --> 00:03.735
These new phones are too fancy.

00:04.163 --> 00:05.479
I don't know how to use them.

00:05.927 --> 00:07.719
It's easy. Watch.

00:08.161 --> 00:09.763
First, pick up the receiver.

00:10.304 --> 00:11.603
I don't hear a dial tone.

00:12.132 --> 00:15.565
You have to press the number of the person you want to speak with first...

00:16.044 --> 00:19.754
...or if you want to dial out of the office, press the number nine.

00:20.525 --> 00:24.316
Is there a directory somewhere, so I can look up people's extension numbers?

00:24.834 --> 00:25.958
They're on this list.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.255
These numbers connect you to other desks in the office.

00:29.951 --> 00:33.629
And when the phone rings, I answer it by pressing the flashing light?

00:34.045 --> 00:38.839
Right. And you can transfer a call by pressing hold and the extension number.
