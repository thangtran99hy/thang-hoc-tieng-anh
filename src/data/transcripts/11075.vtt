Good afternoon! JP&B Associates. How can I help you?

00:06.500 --> 00:08.940
I'd like to speak with Larry Smith, please.

00:09.470 --> 00:11.670
Please hold while I put your call through.

00:13.110 --> 00:17.010
I'm sorry. I'm afraid Mr. Smith is out of the office at the moment.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.880
Would you like to leave a message?

00:19.220 --> 00:22.960
I wanted to check to make sure he remembered our meeting tomorrow.

00:23.390 --> 00:28.060
If you leave your name and number, I'll ask him to call you back when he gets in.

00:28.330 --> 00:31.190
Certainly. My name is Linda Strait.
