00:02.550 --> 00:05.150
Cybertron, our home.

00:06.050 --> 00:09.300
For generations, it has been a peaceful world.

00:09.850 --> 00:14.150
Until pride and a lust for power divided us.

00:15.400 --> 00:20.450
Now, we fight enemies who were once our brothers.

00:56.650 --> 00:59.850
Our tragic war has ravaged Cybertron.

01:02.800 --> 01:06.900
It is a necessary war to return us to glory.

01:08.300 --> 01:11.750
The Autobots will never sacrifice freedom.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
The Decepticons will bring this world to order.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.750
Our defeat would mean the end of everything.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.500
My victory will mark a brilliant new beginning.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.200
One shall stand.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.550
One shall fall.
