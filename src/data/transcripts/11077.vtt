It feels great...

00:05.450 --> 00:12.320
...especially after babies, so, you know, to be back here and to be shooting with Max once again.

00:12.440 --> 00:13.610
He's a total ham!

00:14.710 --> 00:18.550
He started right away. Just super, super comfortable.

00:19.370 --> 00:24.490
Of course, eventually, nap time kicks in and tiredness like we all do...

00:24.590 --> 00:28.090
...but, you know, it was great. It was just super, super great and...

00:28.760 --> 00:29.730
...he's just, he's a trooper.

00:30.090 --> 00:32.600
Beauty to me, that's a tough question to answer.

00:32.760 --> 00:36.700
It's an exuberance of your inner self,...

00:37.000 --> 00:39.900
...honestly. Not to be cliche, but it really boils down to that.

00:41.410 --> 00:49.820
Once, I think, you have a child, you just have a different appreciation for joy and tap in life.

00:49.920 --> 00:54.610
It allows you to experience a whole new side of yourself that you were never really able to before.

00:55.450 --> 00:58.220
I have at least and it's an amazing thing,...

00:58.320 --> 01:02.160
...and it keeps getting better every year and every day to be honest.
