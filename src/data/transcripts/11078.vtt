00:02.650 --> 00:05.050
Have you ever entered a tropical rainforest?

00:05.350 --> 00:09.250
It's a special, dark place completely different from anywhere else.

00:09.850 --> 00:12.800
A rainforest is a place where the trees grow very tall.

00:13.250 --> 00:17.300
Millions of kinds of animals, insects, and plants live in the rainforest.

00:17.700 --> 00:20.000
It is hot and humid in a rainforest.

00:20.350 --> 00:24.150
It rains a lot in the rainforest, but sometimes you don't know it's raining.

00:24.750 --> 00:29.150
The trees grow so closely together that rain doesn't always reach the ground.

00:29.900 --> 00:34.900
Rainforests make up only a small part of the Earth's surface, about six percent.

00:35.300 --> 00:37.600
They are found in tropical parts of the world.

00:38.300 --> 00:41.900
The largest rainforest in the world is the Amazon in South America.

00:42.450 --> 00:47.800
The Amazon covers 1.2 billion acres or almost five million square kilometers.

00:48.300 --> 00:51.200
The second largest rainforest is in Western Africa.

00:51.833 --> 00:55.519
There are also rainforests in Central America, Southeast Asia, Northeastern Australia, and the Pacific Islands.

00:55.762 --> 00:58.345
...Northeastern Australia, and the Pacific Islands.

00:59.050 --> 01:01.250
Rainforests provide us with many things.

01:01.600 --> 01:05.150
In fact, the Amazon Rainforest is called the "lungs of our planet"...

01:05.400 --> 01:08.300
...because it produces twenty percent of the world's oxygen.

01:08.950 --> 01:13.050
One fifth of the world's fresh water is also found in the Amazon Rainforest.

01:13.567 --> 01:17.948
Furthermore, one half of the world's species of animals, plants, and insects...

01:18.043 --> 01:19.642
...live in the Earth's rainforests.

01:20.350 --> 01:23.950
Eighty percent of the food we eat first grew in the rainforest.

01:24.400 --> 01:30.649
For example, pineapples, bananas, tomatoes, corn, potatoes, chocolate, coffee, and sugar...

01:30.753 --> 01:32.528
...all came from rainforests.

01:33.100 --> 01:39.250
Twenty-five percent of the drugs we take when we are sick are made of plants that grow only in rainforests.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.900
Some of these drugs are even used to fight and cure cancer.

01:43.450 --> 01:45.850
With all the good things we get from rainforests,...

01:46.150 --> 01:49.850
...it's surprising to find that we are destroying our rainforests.

01:50.200 --> 01:56.100
In fact, 1.5 acres or 6,000 square meters of rainforest disappear every second.

01:56.733 --> 01:59.815
The forests are being cut down to make fields for cows,...

02:00.115 --> 02:03.084
...to harvest the plants, and to clear land for farms.

02:03.450 --> 02:06.200
Along with losing countless valuable species,...

02:06.500 --> 02:10.300
...the destruction of rainforests creates many problems worldwide.

02:10.900 --> 02:16.850
Destruction of rainforests results in more pollution, less rain, and less oxygen for the world.
