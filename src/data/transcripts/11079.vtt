It used to be that people would drink coffee or tea in the morning to pick them up and get them going for the day.

00:09.350 --> 00:11.100
Then cola drinks hit the market.

00:11.550 --> 00:13.300
With lots of caffeine and sugar,...

00:13.750 --> 00:18.450
...these beverages soon became the pick-me-up of choice for many adults and teenagers.

00:18.550 --> 00:22.600
Now drink companies are putting out so-called "energy drinks."

00:23.100 --> 00:27.700
These beverages have the specific aim of giving tired consumers more energy.

00:28.400 --> 00:31.750
One example of a popular energy drink is Red Bull.

00:32.500 --> 00:38.300
The company that puts out this beverage has stated in interviews that Red Bull is not a thirst quencher.

00:38.900 --> 00:42.050
Nor is it meant to be a fluid replacement drink for athletes.

00:42.500 --> 00:47.700
Instead, the beverage is meant to revitalize a tired consumer's body and mind.

00:48.200 --> 00:52.150
In order to do this, the makers of Red Bull, and other energy drinks,...

00:52.500 --> 00:56.050
...typically add vitamins and certain chemicals to their beverage.

00:56.600 --> 01:01.450
The added chemicals are like chemicals that the body naturally produces for energy.

01:02.033 --> 01:06.213
The vitamins, chemicals, caffeine, and sugar found in these beverages...

01:06.507 --> 01:09.517
...all seem like a sure bet to give a person energy.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.200
Health professionals are not so sure, though.

01:12.850 --> 01:18.200
For one thing, there is not enough evidence to show that all of the vitamins added to energy drinks...

01:18.500 --> 01:20.600
...actually raise a person's energy level.

01:21.200 --> 01:24.550
Another problem is that there are so many things in the beverages.

01:25.100 --> 01:29.350
Nobody knows for sure how all of the ingredients in energy drinks work together.

01:30.100 --> 01:34.200
Dr. Brent Bauer, one of the directors at the Mayo Clinic in the US,...

01:34.550 --> 01:38.100
...cautions people about believing all the claims energy drinks make.

01:38.550 --> 01:44.000
He says, "It is plausible if you put these twelve things together, you will get a good result."

01:44.550 --> 01:49.800
However, Dr. Bauer adds the mix of ingredients could also have a negative impact on the body.

01:50.450 --> 01:53.150
"We just don't know at this point," he says.
