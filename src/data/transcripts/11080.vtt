00:00.800 --> 00:02.230
Have you ever really wanted a beer,...

00:05.200 --> 00:06.400
...but you don't wanna stop working?

00:10.480 --> 00:12.540
At Willow Garage, we've solved this problem.

00:14.540 --> 00:19.320
We built a Web interface that has a menu of a number of different beers that you can select from.

00:20.250 --> 00:23.860
Once you select the beer of your choice, you can place it in the "beer bucket"...

00:24.430 --> 00:27.960
...and then, select the location of your choice for the robot to drive to.

00:28.360 --> 00:32.160
Once those two things are completed, you simply click the big "beer me" button...

00:32.600 --> 00:34.640
...and the robot comes to you to deliver your beer.

00:35.730 --> 00:38.170
In this process, the robot goes to the fridge,...

00:38.470 --> 00:40.400
...detects the handle of the fridge and opens it,...

00:40.740 --> 00:45.470
...looks inside of the fridge and uses its cameras to detect what kinds of beers are available.

00:49.420 --> 00:51.230
If the beers you've selected are not available,...

00:51.390 --> 00:55.180
...the robot will inform you that your choice is not available at this time.

00:55.950 --> 00:58.920
Otherwise, the robot picks the beers that you've selected from the fridge,...

00:59.190 --> 01:04.650
...puts them in the cup holders mounted on its base and delivers them to the location that you've selected.
