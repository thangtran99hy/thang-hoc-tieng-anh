Do you enjoy eating salsa and chips?

00:05.933 --> 00:08.383
Or maybe you like having ketchup on your fries?

00:08.733 --> 00:12.750
Then, you must like the essential ingredient in these sauces, tomatoes.

00:13.233 --> 00:19.483
The tomato originally comes from South America and has been eaten by people there for thousands of years.

00:20.033 --> 00:22.450
Today, tomatoes are popular the world over.

00:22.833 --> 00:24.909
However, when they were first introduced,...

00:25.180 --> 00:28.450
...there was quite a bit of controversy and worry surrounding them.

00:29.233 --> 00:34.650
Ancient Aztec writings mention recipes for dishes of tomatoes, peppers, and salt...

00:35.133 --> 00:37.117
...probably the first salsa recipe!

00:37.667 --> 00:42.950
Spanish soldiers conquered the Aztecs and brought tomato seeds back with them to Europe.

00:43.900 --> 00:48.017
In Europe, these yellowish tomatoes were first called "apples of gold."

00:48.533 --> 00:53.917
For a long time, people in Northern Europe and North America did not eat these "apples of gold".

00:54.500 --> 00:56.340
People were afraid to eat tomatoes...

00:56.439 --> 01:00.850
...because the plant looked similar to the nightshade plant, a deadly poison.

01:01.500 --> 01:06.983
German people even thought that if someone ate tomatoes, he or she would change into a werewolf.

01:07.433 --> 01:13.417
However, by the mid-1800s, people all over the world had accepted the tomato as a good food to eat.

01:14.167 --> 01:17.050
Nevertheless, the tomato was due for more controversy.

01:17.633 --> 01:20.183
Do you think tomatoes are a fruit or a vegetable?

01:20.667 --> 01:22.317
Actually tomatoes are a fruit.

01:22.667 --> 01:25.850
However, in America, tomatoes are a vegetable by law.

01:26.567 --> 01:29.383
Why are tomatoes legally a vegetable in America?

01:29.833 --> 01:33.983
In the 1800s, there was no import tax on fruit from other countries,...

01:34.233 --> 01:36.783
...but there was an import tax on vegetables.

01:37.300 --> 01:41.183
At that time, many tomatoes were coming from other countries into America,...

01:41.467 --> 01:44.917
...and American tomato farmers became worried about making a living.

01:45.700 --> 01:50.917
The government made tomatoes a vegetable by law so that non-American tomatoes would be taxed.

01:51.433 --> 01:54.250
It is easy to tell that the tomato is really a fruit.

01:54.700 --> 01:56.850
In fact, tomatoes are similar to berries.

01:57.133 --> 02:00.983
Both have seeds inside, and both grow from the flowers of a plant.

02:01.300 --> 02:04.350
Both also have delicious flesh surrounding the seeds.

02:04.767 --> 02:07.783
Tomatoes and strawberries are actually in the same family.

02:08.267 --> 02:09.683
Tomato ice cream, anyone?
