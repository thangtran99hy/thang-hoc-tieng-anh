00:03.001 --> 00:04.620
As the new century began,...

00:04.855 --> 00:10.367
...several groups came up with the idea of selecting the greatest sports person of the 20th century.

00:11.057 --> 00:14.519
These groups included the British Broadcasting Company (BBC),...

00:15.039 --> 00:19.821
...Sports Illustrated (SI), and the World Sports Award Organization.

00:20.417 --> 00:25.191
Interestingly, all three named the same person as the Sportsman of the Century!

00:25.970 --> 00:27.709
One man who was among the athletes...

00:27.780 --> 00:32.457
...appearing at the top of these three groups' list was golf legend Jack Nicklaus.

00:33.078 --> 00:37.020
Certainly, no one would doubt that he was the greatest golfer of the century.

00:37.654 --> 00:44.434
His sixth Masters win in 1986 at the age of forty-six amazed golf fans all around the world.

00:45.238 --> 00:48.790
Nicklaus is also known for his charity work to help children in need.

00:49.422 --> 00:52.357
The second sports legend appearing on all three lists,...

00:52.817 --> 00:55.451
...but not winning the top honor was Pelé.

00:56.251 --> 01:02.835
This soccer star led Brazil's World Cup team to victory in 1958 when he was only seventeen years old.

01:03.626 --> 01:08.049
He is the only soccer player in the world to receive three World Cup winning medals.

01:08.758 --> 01:13.080
Over his career, Pelé personally scored more than 1,000 goals.

01:13.797 --> 01:15.277
In addition to his soccer fame,...

01:15.617 --> 01:18.527
...Pelé is also known for working to try and improve life...

01:18.892 --> 01:21.563
...for poor people in Brazil and around the world.

01:22.275 --> 01:29.179
Likewise, the athlete named the Sportsman of the Century by the BBC, SI, and the World Sports Award...

01:29.565 --> 01:31.854
...is known for more than just his sports skills.

01:32.373 --> 01:35.278
This man spoke out against the abuse of civil liberties...

01:35.638 --> 01:38.864
...even to the point of having his awards in his sport taken away.

01:39.508 --> 01:42.598
Then, later in life when faced with Parkinson's disease,...

01:43.028 --> 01:45.429
...he boldly continued to work for his beliefs.

01:46.223 --> 01:49.490
Almost forty years before receiving the award as the greatest,...

01:49.882 --> 01:52.040
...this athlete called himself the greatest...

01:52.447 --> 01:53.478
...and he proved it.

01:54.071 --> 01:59.174
The Sportsman of the 20th Century without a doubt is the boxer Muhammad Ali.
