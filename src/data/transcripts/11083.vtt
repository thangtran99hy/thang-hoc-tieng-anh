00:03.850 --> 00:05.550
We were unimpressed with the Slap Chop,...

00:06.800 --> 00:07.950
...the Ab Circle Pro,...

00:09.000 --> 00:09.900
...and the Snuggies.

00:11.150 --> 00:14.800
Will I ever find something on late night TV that Consumer Reports likes?

00:15.150 --> 00:16.100
How about the Ove Glove?

00:16.400 --> 00:19.450
Watch out! That hot dish can slip, causing a big mess.

00:19.500 --> 00:20.800
You need the Ove Glove.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.500
Do I need the Ove Glove?

00:22.950 --> 00:26.350
Let's see how it does in our labs before I fork over 20 bucks for one.

00:26.933 --> 00:30.245
We use the Ove Glove, along with a regular oven mitt and a potholder...

00:30.321 --> 00:33.358
...to take a Dutch oven out of a 540-degree oven...

00:33.500 --> 00:35.700
...and then hold it for 10-15 seconds.

00:36.100 --> 00:38.400
The potholder scorched, the mitt melted,...

00:38.650 --> 00:41.200
...but the Ove Glove came through with no damage.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.500
Now with nonslip silicone grips!

00:44.150 --> 00:45.000
The grips work.

00:45.050 --> 00:49.650
A panelist said cookware was easier to handle with the Ove Glove than with either the mitt or a potholder.

00:50.333 --> 00:52.643
And when we held the Ove Glove over an open flame,...

00:52.713 --> 00:55.319
...it took twice as long to ignite as a regular mitt.

00:55.800 --> 00:58.800
So, it stands up longer to flames, but what about stains?

00:59.200 --> 01:01.550
Well, after testers indulged their inner child,...

01:01.650 --> 01:05.450
...and splashed the Ove Glove with chocolate, tomato sauce and olive oil,...

01:05.600 --> 01:06.600
...they threw it in the wash.

01:07.350 --> 01:08.750
The Ove Glove triumphed again.

01:08.850 --> 01:10.500
It came out of the wash looking pretty good!

01:11.000 --> 01:15.400
Consumer Reports has finally found an infomercial pitch you can feel good about falling for.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.200
We give the Ove Glove a solid thumbs-up!
