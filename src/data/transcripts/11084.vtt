What do Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci, Julius Caesar, and Napoleon have in common?

00:08.400 --> 00:09.950
They were all left-handed!

00:10.550 --> 00:14.850
Beginning early in history, southpaws were feared, neglected, and punished...

00:14.900 --> 00:17.700
...because use of the left hand was considered evil.

00:18.300 --> 00:21.050
In fact, the Latin word for "left" is "sinister".

00:21.600 --> 00:26.500
Due to this prejudice against the left, left-handed people were forced to switch hands.

00:26.900 --> 00:30.400
This change caused many problems for lefties in school,...

00:30.650 --> 00:34.400
...which resulted in frustration, bad behavior, and high dropout rates.

00:34.950 --> 00:38.700
Maybe that is why lefties were stereotyped as unintelligent,...

00:39.000 --> 00:41.600
...an idea that could not be further from the truth.

00:42.100 --> 00:47.350
Researchers studying the brain have found differences in the left side and right side of the brain.

00:47.950 --> 00:53.500
Researchers believe that people who use more of the left side of their brain tend to be more intelligent.

00:54.100 --> 00:57.600
They also tend to use language better and solve problems faster.

00:58.100 --> 01:03.200
However, one study also showed that left-brained people tend to have worse memories.

01:03.750 --> 01:06.450
So, which side of the brain do lefties use?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.000
Actually, both.

01:08.450 --> 01:11.300
Right-handed people use the left side of the brain more,...

01:11.550 --> 01:15.750
...whereas left-handed people use both sides of the brain almost equally.

01:16.400 --> 01:21.100
The part connecting the two halves of the brain is usually larger in left-handed people.

01:21.647 --> 01:24.135
Therefore, information can pass more efficiently from one side of the brain to the other.

01:24.233 --> 01:25.875
...from one side of the brain to the other.

01:26.635 --> 01:29.991
The left hemisphere of the brain controls speech, language,...

01:30.113 --> 01:32.458
...writing, logic, mathematics, and science.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.850
The right hemisphere controls music, art, creativity, perception, and emotion.

01:38.550 --> 01:43.000
Since lefties use both sides, they are often both creative and scientific.

01:43.350 --> 01:46.100
Approximately ten percent of the world is left-handed...

01:46.300 --> 01:50.300
...and the ratio of left-handed males to left-handed females is two to one.

01:51.081 --> 01:54.552
Thankfully, parents and teachers no longer treat left-handedness...

01:54.621 --> 01:55.979
...as a problem to be cured.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.850
It may actually contribute to a child's excellence!

01:59.300 --> 02:03.650
If allowed to learn and develop in their own way, lefties will excel in school.

02:04.150 --> 02:08.200
Perhaps one of these lefties might turn out to be the next Einstein or da Vinci.
