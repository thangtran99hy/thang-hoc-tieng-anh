My name is Linda Strait. Is Ms. Brown in?

00:05.800 --> 00:07.610
May I ask the reason of your call?

00:07.970 --> 00:11.270
Ms. Brown asked me to check the status of her order with us.

00:12.040 --> 00:14.240
Ms. Brown is not at her desk at the moment.

00:14.780 --> 00:18.250
If you give me your name and number, I can ask her to call you back.

00:18.580 --> 00:20.820
Alright. My name is Linda Strait.

My last name is spelled "S" as in summer,...

00:24.750 --> 00:26.390
..."T" as in teacher,...

00:26.760 --> 00:28.460

00:30.600 --> 00:32.490

00:32.800 --> 00:34.260

00:35.160 --> 00:36.930
I'll give her the message, Ms. Strait.
