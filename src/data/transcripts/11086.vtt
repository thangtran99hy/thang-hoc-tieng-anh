People who enjoy skiing, dream of skiing in exotic places.

00:07.767 --> 00:12.783
These days, they don't have to limit themselves to just the Rocky Mountains or the Swiss Alps.

00:13.267 --> 00:15.483
Now, they can ski in Dubai as well!

00:16.017 --> 00:16.717
That's right.

00:17.067 --> 00:21.983
Dubai, the most populated city in the United Arab Emirates, has a ski resort.

00:22.533 --> 00:25.550
Ski Dubai opened for business in 2005.

00:26.100 --> 00:29.450
Other than being the world's third largest indoor ski facility,...

00:29.927 --> 00:32.983
...Ski Dubai has a number of things to amaze visitors.

00:33.633 --> 00:37.377
First and foremost, this ski facility was built in a place...

00:37.457 --> 00:40.550
...where there are no natural hills and it never snows.

00:41.167 --> 00:45.050
While the desert outdoors can reach 45°C in the summer,...

00:45.500 --> 00:51.183
...the slopes of Ski Dubai are kept at a cool -2°C all year round.

00:51.733 --> 00:56.383
Like any other ski resort, Ski Dubai has a chairlift and ski instructors.

00:56.900 --> 01:02.117
It also boasts a Swiss style cafe on the slopes where skiers can rest and warm up.

01:02.700 --> 01:03.983
However, that's not all.

01:04.400 --> 01:09.183
Along with being able to enjoy the five indoor slopes, including a black diamond slope,...

01:09.700 --> 01:13.117
...visitors are welcome to build snowmen in a designated area.

01:13.700 --> 01:17.483
Children can also enjoy snowball fights in the snowball throwing gallery...

01:17.933 --> 01:22.850
...or they can explore a snow cavern filled with amazing things for kids to see and do.

01:23.467 --> 01:25.150
As if all of that were not enough,...

01:25.533 --> 01:29.816
...it is also possible for guests to experience falling snow from time to time.

01:30.247 --> 01:36.483
When it is time to make new snow inside the facility, the temperature drops to -8°C,...

01:37.000 --> 01:41.250
...then snow guns shoot out chilled water to make a cloud near the ceiling.

01:41.800 --> 01:45.950
Tiny particles of ice are shot into the cloud to form snow crystals.

01:46.367 --> 01:50.583
This man-made snow falls from the ceiling on excited guests below.

01:51.433 --> 01:56.583
When Raed Al Yousofi, a guest at Ski Dubai, experienced his first snowfall,...

01:56.900 --> 01:59.917
...he said, "It's very strange but wonderful."

02:00.400 --> 02:03.883
That is certainly an apt description of Ski Dubai as well.
