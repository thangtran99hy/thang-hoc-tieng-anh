Hello! Welcome to Michael's Business Top Tips.

00:03.645 --> 00:06.845
This month, we're looking at emotional intelligence.

00:07.521 --> 00:11.961
Now, this is a really important human skill for life and business.

00:12.672 --> 00:16.521
Much research has shown that just being smart is not enough.

00:17.115 --> 00:22.189
As well as intelligence, you need emotional intelligence to work well with people.

00:23.315 --> 00:28.176
Here are five steps to help you develop and build your emotional intelligence.

00:29.254 --> 00:31.463
First, know your emotions.

00:32.002 --> 00:35.051
Recognize how you're feeling in a business situation.

00:35.670 --> 00:40.603
Separate your thoughts and judgments of others from your emotional response.

00:41.823 --> 00:44.410
Second, manage your emotions.

00:45.016 --> 00:47.933
Relaxation techniques, deep breathing,...

00:48.308 --> 00:51.906
...keeping a journal where you can express any negative emotions.

00:52.407 --> 00:56.173
These are all good ways to help you manage your own personal emotions.

00:57.593 --> 00:59.561
Third, motivate yourself.

01:00.545 --> 01:04.917
Think what kind of situations do you have negative emotions.

01:05.037 --> 01:07.765
Maybe this kind of meeting or talking to this person.

01:08.297 --> 01:12.019
Think how you can act and behave differently to avoid this.

01:13.645 --> 01:16.787
Fourth, recognize others' emotions.

01:17.648 --> 01:21.798
Try to understand how do other people feel in a given situation.

01:22.456 --> 01:24.750
Look at their body language, facial expression,...

01:25.080 --> 01:28.490
...as well as what they say to help understand how they feel.

01:30.009 --> 01:32.569
And finally, manage relationships.

01:33.165 --> 01:37.455
When working with people, don't just think about the business, numbers, and figures.

01:37.843 --> 01:44.225
Think how can you keep good emotional relationship by recognizing their emotions and respecting them.

01:44.707 --> 01:47.007
By showing understanding and working together.

01:48.449 --> 01:53.616
So emotional intelligence, a very important skill for your business and life.

01:54.209 --> 01:54.724
Good luck!
