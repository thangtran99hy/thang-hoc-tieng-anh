Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:03.550 --> 00:04.700
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:04.850 --> 00:08.050
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:08.600 --> 00:12.700
Alright. Today's Native Maestro, I'd like to pass the stage over to a good friend of mine...

00:12.900 --> 00:16.950
...and he runs a school called Coper in Azabujuban. His name is Imran.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.450
So, Imran.

00:19.250 --> 00:20.100
Hi! Thanks, Seita.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.150
Hi! This is Imran.

00:22.700 --> 00:24.400
I run an English school in Azabujuban...

00:24.750 --> 00:30.150
...and we are located just two minutes away from the station, and so it's very, very convenient,...

00:30.900 --> 00:32.950
...and we have a special way of teaching.

00:33.250 --> 00:36.600
Most of our teachers speak Japanese very well.

00:37.200 --> 00:42.150
So, if you have any questions that you would like to ask, just ask in Japanese...

00:42.350 --> 00:47.000
...and teachers would explain the expressions, vocab, grammar in Japanese,...

00:47.100 --> 00:51.100
...so that you would understand those things perfectly, okay?

00:51.950 --> 00:55.200
Alright. And today's Menu is, "Do you mind?"

00:59.000 --> 01:03.300
You'll be learning two expressions today using, "Do you mind?"

01:03.400 --> 01:05.200
The first one is, "Do you mind if..."...

01:05.950 --> 01:10.900
...and the second one is, "Do you mind not...".

01:12.700 --> 01:15.100
Okay, just please remember these two expressions.

01:15.150 --> 01:18.100
They're very easy to use, very easy to make sentences.

01:18.750 --> 01:23.050
And the first one, "Do you mind if I smoke?"

01:23.550 --> 01:24.700
Do you mind if I smoke?

01:25.300 --> 01:26.900
In Japanese, that would be...

01:29.450 --> 01:29.900
...okay?

01:30.250 --> 01:32.100
And the second one, "Do you mind not...".

01:35.450 --> 01:37.300
Do you mind not smoking?

01:40.100 --> 01:46.350
Okay. Please remember these two expressions and keep in mind they're very, very easy to use.

01:47.850 --> 01:51.900
And you can use these two expressions,...

01:52.000 --> 01:53.800
...you can make these two expressions very easily.

01:54.500 --> 01:58.950
If you have an "if", then you just need the subject and the verb, okay?

02:02.800 --> 02:05.400
And, "Do you mind not smoking?"

02:12.050 --> 02:16.050
Okay, that's it. That's really easy to make these two sentences.

02:16.650 --> 02:19.800
Okay. Now, I'll show you how we use these two expressions.

02:20.200 --> 02:20.700
Seita!

02:20.850 --> 02:21.050
Yeah?

02:21.100 --> 02:21.700
You should help me here.

02:23.400 --> 02:24.900
Do you mind if I go to the bathroom?

02:25.050 --> 02:26.300
Oh, no. Go ahead, I don't mind.

02:26.400 --> 02:26.950
Alright, thanks!

02:27.300 --> 02:28.100
I'm gonna have a cigarette.

02:28.350 --> 02:29.900
Oh! Seita. Sorry, this is a school.

02:30.800 --> 02:31.750
Do you mind not smoking?

02:31.850 --> 02:33.200
Oh, okay. Sorry, my bad.

02:33.750 --> 02:34.300
Sorry about that.

02:34.450 --> 02:38.700
Okay. So now, you know how to make these two sentences...

02:39.100 --> 02:42.300
...and you know how to use them, and what kind of situations you would use them.

02:43.200 --> 02:49.500
So, don't just remember them, you've got to use them in actual conversations, okay?

02:50.500 --> 02:53.100
Alright. So, I hope to see you again.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.200
Have a good day. Bye!
