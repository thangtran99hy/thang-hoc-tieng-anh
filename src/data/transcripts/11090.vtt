Why is it on the Internet and not like in a film release?

00:05.415 --> 00:09.225
Because our country has very strict censorship laws...

00:09.465 --> 00:16.192
...and if we were to release it as a film or on TV, maybe 50% will be cut.

00:16.968 --> 00:22.101
You mean in there like, if you talk about the anti-racism or that kind of social issue?

00:22.180 --> 00:23.711
Yeah, political issues, especially. Yes.

00:23.913 --> 00:27.413
Right. That's why you have to put it on the Internet.

00:27.529 --> 00:29.358
There's a kind of loophole, you mean?

00:29.632 --> 00:32.403
Yes. Well, there is no Internet censorship in this country, so...

00:32.503 --> 00:33.817
Okay.

00:33.909 --> 00:40.464
...that's really the only way certain contents can go out to the country is by the Internet.

00:40.784 --> 00:46.448
So, and this 15Malaysia is now it's, you know,...

00:47.141 --> 00:50.380
...not popular, but really recognized internationally...

00:50.589 --> 00:53.864
...and also, you know, it's like, for example, I just told you I'll vote.

00:53.984 --> 01:01.551
But Facebook for example, has so many numbers of people who've become fans of 15Malaysia.

01:02.132 --> 01:07.062
And have you actually had any expectation from the starting point...

01:07.401 --> 01:11.749
...like what the Internet could do to this.

01:12.981 --> 01:14.533
Could it have some influence?

01:14.989 --> 01:21.928
I think we, the team and I, were expecting it to be very popular anyway from the beginning,...

01:22.838 --> 01:24.038
...but maybe not so...

01:25.608 --> 01:26.546
...maybe not so big.

01:26.647 --> 01:35.703
Because in the end, we had something like 15 million visits in just 60 days on the website,...

01:35.788 --> 01:36.624
...so that's a lot.

01:37.876 --> 01:40.543
I think I was expecting maybe...

01:40.843 --> 01:44.001
...30%, 40% of that, which would still be very good.

01:45.605 --> 01:49.638
But I think, it's the right time and the right place.

01:49.719 --> 01:52.255
I think the Malaysians in particular are,...

01:56.507 --> 02:01.806
...you know, there's a demand for art and films that talks about our country...

02:01.893 --> 02:07.713
...and our problems because many of our newspapers are censored, are controlled.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.296
Most of our newspapers, in fact, are controlled.

02:10.383 --> 02:14.217
So a lot of problems are not discussed in public. Correct.

02:15.643 --> 02:19.128
So, this was one chance to do it and I think everybody came...

02:19.582 --> 02:22.153
...and also, some of the films are very good.
