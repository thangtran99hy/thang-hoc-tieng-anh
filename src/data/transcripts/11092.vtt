00:02.200 --> 00:05.670
I'm calling to confirm that I've received your order by fax.

00:05.900 --> 00:09.170
However, we need to discuss the payment schedule for your order.

00:09.970 --> 00:11.710
Can I get back to you about this?

00:12.080 --> 00:17.350
I don't usually deal with payments and the person who usually handles them is out to lunch.

00:17.680 --> 00:21.880
I see. Would you like me to explain the payment options to that person?

00:22.420 --> 00:25.330
I think we talked about that when we met here in my office.

00:25.620 --> 00:29.490
I think you can leave it to me to inform her of the payment options.

00:29.890 --> 00:34.070
When you have decided on the option you'd like to use, please call me back.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.060
I'll do that.

00:35.440 --> 00:38.570
Is there anything else we need to discuss regarding our order?

00:38.760 --> 00:43.070
No. Once we organize the payment schedule, everything will be set.
