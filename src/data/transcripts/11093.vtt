As computer use becomes more common, the need for security is more important than ever.

00:09.150 --> 00:12.800
One of the greatest security threats in the online world is computer hacking.

00:13.400 --> 00:18.200
Computer hacking is the unauthorized access to a computer or network of computers.

00:18.650 --> 00:21.500
Hackers are people who illegally enter systems.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.700
They may alter or delete information, steal private information,...

00:26.000 --> 00:29.400
...or spread viruses that can damage or destroy files.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.650
But how exactly can a hacker get into a system to do these things?

00:34.250 --> 00:39.400
Most hackers use information called protocols that are built into computer software.

00:40.050 --> 00:43.350
These protocols allow computers to interact with one another.

00:43.850 --> 00:46.800
Protocols are sort of like computer police officers.

00:47.200 --> 00:52.200
When a computer connects to another system, the protocols check to see if the access is valid.

00:52.650 --> 00:57.450
The protocols can also determine how much information can be shared between the two systems.

00:57.800 --> 01:02.250
Hackers can manipulate the protocols to get unlimited access to a computer system.

01:02.800 --> 01:06.900
In fact, just the act of entering a computer network is considered hacking.

01:07.450 --> 01:09.900
This is commonly called passive hacking.

01:10.500 --> 01:16.600
Passive hackers get a rush from just being able to access a challenging system like a bank or military network.

01:17.200 --> 01:20.100
Another kind of hacker tries to do damage to a system.

01:20.650 --> 01:27.150
After hacking into systems, these hackers release viruses or alter, delete, or take information.

01:27.800 --> 01:31.700
Known as active hackers, they are by far, the more dangerous of the two.

01:32.500 --> 01:35.800
The easiest way to protect a system is with a good password.

01:36.250 --> 01:39.800
Long and unusual passwords are harder for hackers to guess.

01:40.250 --> 01:45.450
For even greater security, some online services now use "password-plus" systems.

01:45.750 --> 01:48.550
In this case, users first put in a password...

01:48.600 --> 01:53.200
...and then put in a second code that changes after the user accesses the site.

01:53.850 --> 01:59.250
Users either have special cards or devices that show them the new code to use the next time.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.900
Even if a hacker steals the password, they won't have the code.

02:03.400 --> 02:07.100
Or if the hacker somehow gets the code, they still don't know the password.
