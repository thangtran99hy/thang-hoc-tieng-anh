00:04.800 --> 00:10.870
To put trees back or to be a part of the force of people putting trees back into this land,...

00:10.970 --> 00:13.140
...broadleaf trees, hardwood forests...

00:13.840 --> 00:17.650
...spills over a rich abundance, which isn't related to money...

00:18.180 --> 00:19.780
...or material possessions.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.890
To be amongst forests,...

00:22.050 --> 00:25.290
...particularly at this stage, a young forest is also very enlivening.

00:26.160 --> 00:29.430
I think what's new about The Local Project is that if it's...

00:30.260 --> 00:34.630
...firmly rooted into the community instead of just with the efforts of one individual,...

00:35.030 --> 00:41.040
...then there's a possibility that the forest will be allowed to grow on through the generations.

00:41.510 --> 00:44.010
And that the timber then coming from those forests,...

00:44.410 --> 00:49.280
...there will be a continual supply built up over the years, which is actually what the industry needs,...

00:49.680 --> 00:52.750
...and that's what The Local Project was about,...

00:52.800 --> 00:54.900
...to make a beginning in that direction.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.690
That's all we can do in this lifetime.
