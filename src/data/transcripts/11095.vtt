00:02.750 --> 00:05.150
Have you ever thought about inventing something?

00:05.750 --> 00:09.400
Did you worry that your idea was too strange or unrealistic?

00:09.850 --> 00:12.150
Well, maybe you should think again.

00:12.800 --> 00:17.000
Strange or unrealistic ideas never stopped Arthur Pedrick.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.100
Pedrick was a British inventor.

00:19.567 --> 00:21.158
Originally a government clerk,...

00:21.519 --> 00:28.002
...he spent his retirement in the 1960s and 1970s developing new and unusual ideas.

00:28.300 --> 00:32.850
Some of these ideas contradicted basic physics, but that didn't stop Pedrick!

00:33.167 --> 00:36.925
One of his strangest ideas was a plan to connect large tubes...

00:37.046 --> 00:40.373
...from the continent of Australia all the way to Antarctica,...

00:40.600 --> 00:42.900
...a distance of 10,000 kilometers!

00:43.400 --> 00:47.550
These tubes would carry giant ice balls from Antarctica to Australia.

00:48.300 --> 00:50.882
This ice would then melt in the Australian desert,...

00:51.217 --> 00:53.373
...and the water would be used in irrigation.

00:53.650 --> 00:57.300
Another of Pedrick's inventions was a radio-controlled golf ball.

00:57.767 --> 01:00.999
A golfer could change the speed and direction of the golf ball...

01:01.241 --> 01:04.163
...by small flaps, controlled by computer chips.

01:04.550 --> 01:08.400
Using radio waves, the golfer could also find lost golf balls.

01:09.033 --> 01:12.451
Arthur Pedrick had thousands of bizarre ideas for inventions,...

01:12.728 --> 01:14.301
...most of which were never built.

01:14.933 --> 01:17.577
Though many of Pedrick's inventions were never developed,...

01:17.938 --> 01:19.924
...a lot of other strange ideas were.

01:20.450 --> 01:26.600
In 1989, a company designed and sold a theft prevention device for expensive cars.

01:27.050 --> 01:31.250
As part of this device, several tubes were attached to the bottom of a car.

01:31.733 --> 01:33.696
If someone tried to steal the car,...

01:33.969 --> 01:37.758
...super hot flames would come out of the tubes and burn the car thief.

01:38.150 --> 01:41.550
Some people who were not thieves, however, were seriously injured.

01:42.100 --> 01:45.350
They accidentally set off the device by walking past the car.

01:45.850 --> 01:51.000
Other strange inventions include underwear for dogs and pens with drinkable ink.

01:51.650 --> 01:55.200
The underwear keeps dogs from making a mess when they go out for a walk.

01:55.767 --> 01:58.596
Also, if you are ever thirsty during a test,...

01:58.790 --> 02:01.713
...a pen with drinkable ink would be very handy.

02:02.050 --> 02:05.600
If you have an idea that seems a little out in left field,...

02:05.950 --> 02:07.750
...don't let that stop you from trying it.

02:08.200 --> 02:09.700
You'll be in good company.
