Girl scouting changes girls' lives in more ways than you can imagine.

00:04.670 --> 00:08.570
It begins when a girl makes a promise to live by the Girl Scout law.

00:08.740 --> 00:11.268
Through its strong timeless values,...

00:11.330 --> 00:14.910
...the girl scout law guides how girls relate to other girl scouts,...

00:15.010 --> 00:17.580
...family, community, and the planet.

00:18.110 --> 00:21.980
School prepares you for your career, but Girl Scouts prepares you for life...

00:22.990 --> 00:26.180
...very real and practical skills for the 21st century.

00:26.280 --> 00:28.290
They're learning critical thinking skills.

00:28.405 --> 00:32.465
They're learning decision-making skills, and project planning skills,...

00:32.553 --> 00:35.368
...and communication skills, and working as a team.

00:35.730 --> 00:37.730
I can do anything I put my mind to.

00:37.930 --> 00:40.994
What girl scouting does better than any other organization...

00:41.058 --> 00:44.050
...has helped girls discover their innate potential to lead.

00:44.270 --> 00:47.010
...and to become comfortable taking on leadership roles.

00:47.110 --> 00:50.900
Since we're older, we get to do more hands-on experience and plan our own meetings.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.950
We build strong, positive women who will be the leaders of tomorrow.
