00:02.500 --> 00:04.717
Since the early days of making movies,...

00:04.787 --> 00:07.620
...writers and directors have attempted to bring popular...

00:07.698 --> 00:09.750
...and classic novels to the big screen.

00:10.367 --> 00:12.050
That tradition continues today.

00:12.467 --> 00:16.083
The movie industry seems to believe that if the story made a great book,...

00:16.447 --> 00:18.183
...it should make a great movie as well.

00:18.567 --> 00:20.883
However, that rarely seems to be the case.

00:21.400 --> 00:24.349
More often than not, a great book turns out to be...

00:24.430 --> 00:27.250
...a mediocre movie in the opinion of most viewers.

00:27.900 --> 00:29.961
Perhaps that is because readers of the book...

00:30.152 --> 00:32.983
...have already made their own great "movies" in their heads.

00:33.467 --> 00:36.950
Then, when they see the studio's or the director's version of the story,...

00:37.267 --> 00:40.117
...it does not quite measure up to their expectations.

00:40.900 --> 00:43.850
Over the past one hundred years of film production,...

00:44.100 --> 00:46.123
...there have only been a handful of movies...

00:46.197 --> 00:47.883
...that have fulfilled the ambition...

00:48.100 --> 00:50.517
...of turning the great book into a great movie.

00:51.300 --> 00:53.399
Literary critics as well as movie critics...

00:53.473 --> 00:56.650
...applaud both versions of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest".

00:57.367 --> 00:59.717
The classic children's story, "The Wizard of Oz",...

00:59.900 --> 01:02.663
...was transformed into a classic movie musical...

01:02.937 --> 01:05.117
...that parents and children still enjoy today.

01:05.867 --> 01:08.750
Lovers of the historical novel, "Gone with the Wind",...

01:09.067 --> 01:14.250
...continue to be swept away by the movie adaptation starring Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh.

01:14.933 --> 01:17.407
Science fiction readers as well as movie critics...

01:17.511 --> 01:21.483
...both hail Stanley Kubrick's film, 2001: A Space Odyssey,...

01:21.767 --> 01:25.927
...which was co-written by Kubrick with the novel's author Arthur C. Clarke...

01:26.159 --> 01:27.117
...as a masterpiece.

01:27.667 --> 01:31.653
On the other hand, there have been instances when not so great novels...

01:31.743 --> 01:33.950
...have been transformed into great movies.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.363
Mario Puzo's "The Godfather"...

01:36.576 --> 01:39.450
...was quite popular at the time of its release as a novel,...

01:39.767 --> 01:44.183
...but critics hailed it more for its entertainment value than for its value as literature.

01:44.967 --> 01:47.917
The film adaptation of this popular novel, however,...

01:48.167 --> 01:51.917
...continues to be listed among the top ten greatest movies of all time.

01:52.833 --> 01:57.683
Likewise, the science fiction short story, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"...

01:57.900 --> 02:01.550
...did not set the science fiction genre on fire when it came out.

02:02.267 --> 02:05.617
The movie version, though, made a much bigger impact in its medium.

02:05.933 --> 02:10.350
Today, "Blade Runner" continues to top critics' lists of great films.

02:11.033 --> 02:14.083
Are there any books that are simply impossible to film?

02:14.567 --> 02:16.883
Although filmmakers would like to think not,...

02:17.133 --> 02:21.817
...it is a good bet that certain books will never be adapted into successful films.

02:22.267 --> 02:27.050
Books written in unique literary styles such as "Ulysses" by James Joyce...

02:27.333 --> 02:29.847
...and "The Sound and the Fury" by William Faulkner...

02:30.129 --> 02:33.850
...have resisted film adaptation to rival the greatness of the books.

02:34.333 --> 02:36.883
Filmmakers will no doubt keep trying, of course.

02:37.467 --> 02:40.308
Readers and viewers will have to be the final judges...

02:40.507 --> 02:43.450
...of whether it is better to read the book or see the movie.
