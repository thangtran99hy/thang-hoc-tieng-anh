Hi, Linda! I've been calling all morning, but the line has been busy.

00:08.181 --> 00:10.144
Hello? Can you speak up?

00:10.543 --> 00:11.931
I can hardly hear you.

00:12.292 --> 00:13.468
Who is calling, please?

00:14.173 --> 00:16.749
It's Diane! Can you hear me now?

00:17.294 --> 00:20.405
Hi, Diane! What's wrong with this phone line?

00:20.823 --> 00:22.169
Is your battery dying?

00:22.750 --> 00:24.054
It's not my cell phone.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.752
This line is terrible.

00:26.132 --> 00:28.256
Let me hang up and call you right back.

00:29.108 --> 00:29.665
Hello?

00:30.323 --> 00:32.323
Who is this? Is this Linda?

00:32.737 --> 00:34.281
There's no Linda here.

00:34.649 --> 00:36.649
I think you have the wrong number.
