00:03.200 --> 00:07.283
Certain birds are, more often than not, considered bad luck,...

00:07.567 --> 00:09.583
...or even a sign of impending death.

00:10.167 --> 00:16.183
For example, all over the world, both crows and ravens have some connection to war, and death.

00:16.833 --> 00:21.450
In early times, crows and ravens were thought to accompany the gods of war,...

00:21.900 --> 00:24.450
...or be signs of the gods' approaching arrival.

00:25.100 --> 00:26.717
This idea later changed.

00:27.367 --> 00:31.045
Crows in particular were thought to be harbingers of ill fortune...

00:31.197 --> 00:34.583
...or, in some cases, guides to the afterlife.

00:35.233 --> 00:39.817
Woe be it to the person who saw a single crow or raven flying overhead,...

00:40.233 --> 00:44.117
...for this was most certainly a portent of death in the near future.

00:44.767 --> 00:48.883
Interestingly, though potentially bad luck for people individually,...

00:49.200 --> 00:52.583
...the raven is considered to be good luck for the crown of England.

00:53.033 --> 00:59.383
So much so, in fact, that a "raven master" is, even today, an actual government position in London.

01:00.033 --> 01:03.583
He takes care of the ravens there and also clips their wings,...

01:03.967 --> 01:08.517
...ensuring that these birds can never fly far from the seat of the British government.

01:09.067 --> 01:12.383
This way, the kingdom will never fall to ill fortune.

01:13.100 --> 01:18.583
Another bird that is thought to play a part in forecasting the fortunes of people is the swallow.

01:19.133 --> 01:21.283
Depending on how and when it is seen,...

01:21.567 --> 01:25.483
...the swallow can be a harbinger of either good or ill fortune.

01:26.033 --> 01:29.283
Perhaps inspired by the swallow's red-brown breast,...

01:29.667 --> 01:33.717
...Christian people initially related the swallow to the death of Jesus Christ.

01:34.167 --> 01:39.383
Thus, people who saw a swallow fly through their house considered it a portent of death.

01:40.167 --> 01:44.650
Later, however, farmers began to consider swallows signs of good fortune.

01:45.367 --> 01:49.917
Any barn that has swallows living in it is sure to be blessed in the following year.

01:50.767 --> 01:53.383
Farmers also have to beware of killing a swallow;...

01:53.833 --> 01:57.017
...that would be certain to end any good luck they might have had.

01:58.067 --> 02:01.517
Though many people think these superstitions are old wives' tales,...

02:01.867 --> 02:04.283
...there is actually some evidence to support them.

02:04.900 --> 02:10.850
For example, crows and ravens, being scavengers, appear at the aftermath of battles.

02:11.500 --> 02:17.517
Thus, large numbers of crows and ravens could be good indications of war in an area.

02:18.133 --> 02:22.517
As well, swallows feed on insects that can cause infections in cattle.

02:23.033 --> 02:29.183
Thus, a farmer who has many swallows in his barn may actually have healthier animals on his farm.

02:29.700 --> 02:34.383
Therefore, the next time you feel inclined to laugh at an old wives' tale,...

02:34.667 --> 02:37.997
...maybe you had better find out if there is any truth to it first!
