00:02.900 --> 00:05.917
Alaska is disappearing slowly but surely.

00:06.433 --> 00:09.003
It is estimated that since the 1950s,...

00:09.083 --> 00:13.383
...as much as fifteen percent of Alaska's land area has disappeared.

00:13.833 --> 00:16.250
How can a whole state be disappearing?

00:16.633 --> 00:19.417
The problem is that Alaska's glaciers are melting.

00:19.767 --> 00:22.716
The state has more than 100,000 glaciers.

00:23.233 --> 00:27.117
These glaciers account for about 75,000 square kilometers...

00:27.367 --> 00:29.650
...or five percent of the state's area.

00:30.100 --> 00:32.850
That is an area of land larger than Ireland!

00:33.367 --> 00:36.883
According to a recent report by the US Geological Survey,...

00:37.100 --> 00:41.517
...ninety-nine percent of Alaska's glaciers are either retreating or diminishing.

00:42.133 --> 00:46.150
This diminishing seems mainly due to the increase in global temperatures.

00:46.533 --> 00:52.950
Since the 1960s, the average year-round temperature has increased by almost three degrees Celsius.

00:53.367 --> 00:58.717
Additionally, the average winter temperature has increased by over six degrees Celsius.

00:59.233 --> 01:02.793
Presently, an estimated 100 cubic kilometers of ice...

01:03.079 --> 01:06.117
...is disappearing from Alaskan glaciers every year.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.950
It may be even more in the near future...

01:09.233 --> 01:17.850
...as some scientists predict that the average world temperature could go up four to seven degrees Celsius by the year 2100.

01:18.467 --> 01:22.317
Another problem facing Alaska is its thawing permafrost.

01:22.767 --> 01:28.316
Much of the land in Alaska used to be permanently frozen or frozen for most of the year.

01:28.900 --> 01:34.183
Now, the thawing permafrost is causing a number of problems for people living in Alaska.

01:34.900 --> 01:40.883
Roads and utility poles are collapsing as the ground around and under them warms and softens.

01:41.367 --> 01:46.043
Also, the hard permafrost that originally prevented beaches from eroding...

01:46.133 --> 01:48.317
...during violent storms is now melting.

01:49.033 --> 01:53.383
People who live along Alaska's coasts are being forced to relocate.

01:53.900 --> 01:59.517
For villages on small, low islands, one terrible storm could wipe out the entire community.

02:00.267 --> 02:05.767
The melting permafrost and increasing temperatures are both affecting the forests of Alaska.

02:06.367 --> 02:08.850
As the permafrost under the forests melts,...

02:09.133 --> 02:14.017
...insects that normally do not turn up until the warmer seasons are appearing sooner.

02:14.767 --> 02:16.753
The spruce-bark beetle, for example,...

02:17.010 --> 02:20.717
...is increasing in numbers as a result of warmer winter temperatures.

02:21.233 --> 02:26.917
It usually takes about two years for these beetles to grow and reproduce in very cold weather.

02:27.367 --> 02:29.850
However, due to the increase in temperatures,...

02:30.133 --> 02:32.883
...spruce-bark beetles are reproducing faster...

02:33.233 --> 02:38.117
...and damaging as many trees in one year as they previously damaged in two.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.716
If something cannot be done to change things,...

02:41.019 --> 02:44.317
...Alaska's forests will not survive the turn of the century.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.450
Some scientists believe that human activity is linked to a global increase in weather temperature.

02:51.133 --> 02:53.717
Whatever the cause of rising temperatures may be,...

02:54.033 --> 02:58.699
...the fact remains that temperatures are warming, affecting Alaska for the worse.

02:59.267 --> 03:04.717
Horribly, this could be a preview of what will happen to the rest of the world in the next century.
