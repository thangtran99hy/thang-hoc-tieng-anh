00:00.950 --> 00:03.000
Welcome to AERA English's Native Maestro.

00:03.300 --> 00:04.400
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:04.850 --> 00:07.800
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:08.650 --> 00:09.600
Today's Maestro Hook.

00:10.100 --> 00:13.900
A Hook is a good conversation piece you can use with a foreigner when you're talking about something.

00:14.350 --> 00:17.900
And today's Hook is a story about what happened to me when I went back to New York.

00:18.950 --> 00:21.750
When I went back to New York and I had dinner with my friends at my house,...

00:22.150 --> 00:25.950
...my friend asked me, "So Seita, I forgot. Were you a Republican or Democrat?"...

00:26.750 --> 00:31.500
...and I remembered, "Oh, yeah! Politics at the dinner table is nothing bad...

00:31.650 --> 00:33.150
...and a lot of people talk about it in the States,...

00:33.250 --> 00:36.500
...but in Japan, many people don't talk about politics at home."

00:37.133 --> 00:39.375
So at that time when they asked me,...

00:39.517 --> 00:42.549
...they also asked me, "What do you think about the Japanese political situation?"...

00:42.900 --> 00:46.600
...and once again, Japanese people don't really have a strong opinion about politics,...

00:46.967 --> 00:48.155
...but in the States,...

00:48.305 --> 00:51.515
...a lot of people are very strong and they have a specific opinion,...

00:51.600 --> 00:53.450
...and it made me realize the difference of culture.

00:53.650 --> 00:56.650
So, the lesson is "Dinner time politics".

00:56.800 --> 01:00.300
As long as it's something that everyone can talk about is not a taboo in the States.

01:00.350 --> 01:04.050
So when people ask you, you should express your opinion, alright?

01:04.750 --> 01:07.850
So, something connected to that, today's Maestro Menu.

01:19.600 --> 01:20.650
I'm indifferent.

01:23.200 --> 01:23.800
Indifferent.

01:27.700 --> 01:28.300
I'm indifferent.

01:35.900 --> 01:36.550
I'm indifferent.

01:43.100 --> 01:43.450
Okay?

01:46.650 --> 01:47.700
Voice your opinion.

01:50.250 --> 01:51.350
I voice my opinion.

01:55.150 --> 01:57.350
I should voice my opinion at work.

02:00.850 --> 02:02.500
Japanese people should voice their opinion.

02:08.950 --> 02:09.400
Okay.

02:15.600 --> 02:18.000
Alright, Maestro Lines.

02:21.075 --> 02:24.594
So, what do you think about the Japanese political situation...

02:24.744 --> 02:26.830
...or what do the Japanese people think about politics?

02:27.450 --> 02:29.850
Well, you know what? Japanese people are very indifferent.

02:30.550 --> 02:32.900
They don't really wanna talk about politics at the dinner table.

02:36.900 --> 02:39.500
What do Japanese people think about the American president?

02:40.300 --> 02:43.400
Oh! I think it's really great that many people voice their opinion.

02:43.850 --> 02:46.050
Japanese people should voice their opinion more.

02:49.350 --> 02:53.400
Alright. So, it's perfectly normal to talk about politics at the dinner table, so...

02:53.850 --> 02:56.450
...express yourself and voice yourself, alright?

02:57.650 --> 03:00.250
That's it for today and thanks for watching the Native Maestro,...

03:00.450 --> 03:01.600
...and I hope to see you again next week.

03:02.050 --> 03:04.750
Alright! See you later and voice yourself.
