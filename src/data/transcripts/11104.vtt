Most people know that a balanced diet and regular exercise are very important.

00:08.367 --> 00:11.983
However, most people do not know how to exercise properly.

00:12.633 --> 00:17.750
Instead of concentrating on how to get the best results efficiently and effectively,...

00:18.233 --> 00:20.517
...people usually rush through their workouts...

00:20.833 --> 00:23.417
...or they make the same common workout mistakes.

00:23.967 --> 00:29.783
Exercising the right way is important for people who are worried about their health and their appearance.

00:30.433 --> 00:37.417
However, if someone is not working out properly, it is rare that he or she will see the results he or she wants.

00:38.100 --> 00:43.850
Therefore, training experts have devised tips to teach people how to exercise correctly...

00:44.167 --> 00:46.783
...in order to achieve the greatest health benefits.

00:47.300 --> 00:49.917
If you want to achieve the best workout results,...

00:50.233 --> 00:52.817
...here are a few helpful tips to bear in mind.

00:53.633 --> 00:58.317
One of the most common workout mistakes is doing the same routine over and over again.

00:58.833 --> 01:00.717
This does not challenge your muscles...

01:01.100 --> 01:05.050
...and it can actually prevent muscles from growing and repairing themselves.

01:05.633 --> 01:08.250
Instead of always sticking to the same old workout,...

01:08.667 --> 01:12.117
...it is important to change your routine every six to eight weeks.

01:12.567 --> 01:16.317
It is also important to add a variety of workouts to your routine...

01:16.700 --> 01:21.717
...such as swimming, yoga, or biking to make sure your whole body stays fit.

01:22.300 --> 01:24.717
This will help make your workouts more interesting...

01:25.100 --> 01:28.117
...and benefit your health and muscle development as well.

01:28.833 --> 01:33.450
Another mistake people tend to make is to work out too hard, too often.

01:34.167 --> 01:38.850
Your body needs to rest between workouts. Otherwise, no progress will be made.

01:39.433 --> 01:44.517
It is best to keep the number of hard workout routines to no more than two per week.

01:45.200 --> 01:49.050
Then, for those who don't want to get off schedule by skipping a day,...

01:49.533 --> 01:53.383
...shorter workouts of about twenty minutes can be used on other days.

01:54.033 --> 01:55.717
For more variety in workouts,...

01:56.033 --> 02:00.630
...you could also plan an easier routine for forty to sixty minutes...

02:00.924 --> 02:04.050
...between days of shorter, more intense workouts.

02:04.300 --> 02:08.717
Experts recommend, however, taking at least one day off completely each week,...

02:09.200 --> 02:12.217
...especially after several hard workout days in a row.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.183
In reality, no one is perfect.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.983
However, if you want to make a difference in your overall health,...

02:19.333 --> 02:21.050
...there are some things you can do.

02:21.567 --> 02:24.117
Stretch before and after every workout.

02:24.700 --> 02:28.983
Do not rush your routine and do not work out too little or too much.

02:29.567 --> 02:32.383
Remember not to make these common workout mistakes...

02:32.700 --> 02:35.117
...and always have fun while exercising!
