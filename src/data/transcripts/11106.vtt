00:00.883 --> 00:02.711
More good stuff!

00:03.715 --> 00:04.867
You can have Bobo.

00:05.436 --> 00:06.790
Carmen ate his head off.

00:06.905 --> 00:07.949
You can have this too.

00:08.044 --> 00:09.476
It doesn't slink anymore.

00:10.516 --> 00:11.430
Very generous.

00:12.042 --> 00:15.206
Michelle, why don't you give Nicky and Alex something that's not broken?

00:15.483 --> 00:17.762
Why? Babies will play with anything.

00:19.265 --> 00:19.870
Really?

00:22.121 --> 00:23.562
Here. Want my old watch?

00:23.767 --> 00:24.735
The hour hand fell off.

00:24.861 --> 00:25.965
It only tells minutes now.

00:27.040 --> 00:29.031
Oh, cool! Thanks!

00:31.537 --> 00:32.875
Look what I got!

00:34.473 --> 00:36.761
Christmas shopping for these three should be easy.
