Is this Pizza House? We ordered a pizza over an hour ago!

00:06.240 --> 00:09.440
I apologize for that, sir. Can I get your name?

00:09.840 --> 00:11.410
It's Sam Strait.

00:11.870 --> 00:16.090
I'm sorry, Mr. Strait, but I can't find your order on our computer.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.050
What?

00:17.300 --> 00:18.750
I think there was an error.

00:18.980 --> 00:21.880
By some oversight, your order was never recorded.

00:22.220 --> 00:26.260
I don't know who is to blame for this. Do you know who took the order?

00:26.420 --> 00:30.820
No, I can't remember. This kind of service is totally unacceptable.

00:31.030 --> 00:34.500
I assure you, Mr. Strait, this kind of thing rarely happens.

00:34.730 --> 00:37.170
We'll get a pizza to your house immediately.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.600
We're very sorry for the inconvenience.
