Have you had a chance to look over the handout for my presentation?

00:07.150 --> 00:07.900
Yes, Mark.

00:08.200 --> 00:10.700
And I have some questions about the content.

00:11.150 --> 00:11.650
Really?

00:12.100 --> 00:15.000
Do you think I need to adjust the content of the presentation?

00:15.300 --> 00:15.950
A little.

00:16.250 --> 00:20.900
For instance, I don't think the example you give in the introduction is really relevant...

00:21.350 --> 00:24.650
...and the complexity of the last two sections of the presentation...

00:24.950 --> 00:29.000
...may be too much to explain in the allotted time for this presentation.

00:29.450 --> 00:33.400
I guess I have a lot more work to do on the structure of the whole presentation.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.200
Maybe after you work on it more, you can practice in front of me.

00:37.400 --> 00:37.750
Great!

00:38.250 --> 00:42.800
You can tell me if I use good eye contact or have distracting mannerisms.
