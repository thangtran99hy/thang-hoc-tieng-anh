Good afternoon, everyone.

00:03.400 --> 00:06.900
I'm Mark White, and my position is in the sales department.

00:07.550 --> 00:10.200
As you can tell from the title of my presentation,...

00:10.550 --> 00:12.700
...the topic I would like to speak about today...

00:12.900 --> 00:18.700
...is methods to get customer feedback about products through informal communication opportunities.

00:19.450 --> 00:22.000
First I'd like to outline my presentation...

00:22.300 --> 00:27.150
...before I jump into the background of how feedback is usually obtained by our company...

00:27.450 --> 00:30.100
...and why informal feedback is useful.

00:30.650 --> 00:34.400
As you can see in the handout, there are three main points I'll talk about...

00:34.650 --> 00:37.600
...regarding each informal communication opportunity.

00:38.250 --> 00:40.700
Let me just write those three points on the whiteboard...

00:41.000 --> 00:44.600
...because I'm going to be referring to them a lot in this presentation.

00:45.300 --> 00:48.900
Then we can move on to the brief outline and introduction.
