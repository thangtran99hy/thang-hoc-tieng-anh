It is important for customers to feel like their ideas are valued.

00:08.050 --> 00:10.500
I think that covers everything on my second point.

00:10.900 --> 00:13.100
Are there any questions or comments at this point?

00:13.900 --> 00:15.250
I have a question, Mark.

00:15.850 --> 00:20.900
What kind of system do you use for organizing and sharing this kind of customer feedback?

00:21.600 --> 00:22.850
That's a great question.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.100
I plan to cover that a little later.

00:25.650 --> 00:28.850
I have some thoughts on ways to deal with sharing such feedback.

00:29.500 --> 00:34.650
I'll go over the final section of my presentation, then come back to your question. OK?

00:35.400 --> 00:36.250
That's fine.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.400
Now, I want to return to how informal feedback can be encouraged.
