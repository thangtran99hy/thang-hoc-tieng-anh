Let me quickly just go over our schedule again.

00:05.509 --> 00:10.747
The Thursday morning meeting has been postponed until Monday afternoon at 3 o'clock.

00:11.180 --> 00:12.001
Is that right?

00:12.533 --> 00:17.002
That's right. I'll send you an e-mail Friday to confirm that time again.

00:17.472 --> 00:22.195
OK. We'll just leave it at that unless I hear anything different by Friday.

00:22.869 --> 00:25.458
I'm sorry about having to change our schedule.

00:25.841 --> 00:26.970
Thanks for your patience.

00:27.393 --> 00:28.541
It's no problem.

00:28.982 --> 00:30.899
I'll look forward to seeing you Monday...

00:31.361 --> 00:34.808
...and if I can be of any more assistance, just give me a call.

00:35.187 --> 00:37.346
I will. See you on Monday.

00:37.686 --> 00:38.233
Bye!
