00:02.900 --> 00:06.850
We can contrast the results from the company's formal product feedback...

00:07.250 --> 00:10.400
...with the results I found in informal conversations.

00:10.850 --> 00:16.550
There is a remarkable difference in both the type and quality of feedback from these two methods.

00:17.100 --> 00:22.500
Do you think it's possible for anyone to achieve this kind of result through informal customer feedback?

00:23.000 --> 00:24.850
Frankly speaking, yes.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.900
Informal feedback is really simple to get.

00:28.450 --> 00:30.550
There is nothing complex about the method.

00:31.250 --> 00:37.200
The essential point is that you have to create a space for it during meetings or conversations with clients.

00:38.350 --> 00:42.050
The feedback is certainly an improvement over the formal feedback.

00:43.000 --> 00:43.700
Exactly!

00:44.300 --> 00:49.200
Let me reiterate. It's critical to be open to hearing client feedback.
