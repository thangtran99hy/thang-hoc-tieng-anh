I'm a little worried about calling Mr. Sanchez in Mexico, Mark.

00:08.100 --> 00:12.237
I'm not used to dealing with international clients. Any suggestions?

00:12.783 --> 00:16.557
I've heard it's good to start with small talk before you get down to business.

00:17.019 --> 00:20.647
Americans respect directness, but other cultures may not.

00:21.801 --> 00:26.033
Is it appropriate for me to call him "Mr." or should I use "SeÃ±or"?

00:26.488 --> 00:29.078
I think Mr. is the safer title to use.

00:29.360 --> 00:32.407
I'm also worried I might not understand his accent.

00:33.041 --> 00:36.336
I guarantee you won't understand everything. But don't worry.

00:36.658 --> 00:42.494
Just ask him to repeat or clarify and concisely summarize your notes before you hang up.
