How did your call with Mr. Sanchez go?

00:04.587 --> 00:10.212
Great! I made a list of objectives before I called and referred to it during the call.

00:10.653 --> 00:12.947
That kept us both from wasting time.

00:13.605 --> 00:15.908
He didn't think you were too aggressive, did he?

00:16.221 --> 00:17.271
I don't think so.

00:17.599 --> 00:20.710
He was very agreeable and polite during our conversation.

00:21.195 --> 00:24.333
One thing I didn't anticipate was his sense of humor.

00:24.869 --> 00:27.821
I'm sure you did a great job representing the company.

00:28.274 --> 00:30.811
You always speak with such authority in meetings.

00:31.186 --> 00:34.284
And a trick I learned for the phone is to talk standing up.

00:34.689 --> 00:35.783
It really works!
