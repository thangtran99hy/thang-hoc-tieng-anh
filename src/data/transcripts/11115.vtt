Do you know if any other items are on the agenda for tomorrow's meeting?

00:06.470 --> 00:11.090
All I know is that the chair will share his recommendations for new sales techniques...

00:11.170 --> 00:14.510
...and then he'll ask all the participants to share their ideas.

00:14.980 --> 00:18.710
Did the chair already nominate someone to be secretary for the meeting?

00:19.010 --> 00:23.320
I don't think so. Usually Karen writes up the minutes of meetings in our department.

00:23.550 --> 00:25.550
She's always the unofficial secretary.

00:26.090 --> 00:28.460
What time is the meeting going to take place?

00:28.760 --> 00:31.160
It's scheduled for 2:30 in the conference room.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.860
I hope it adjourns before 5:00.

00:34.330 --> 00:38.080
As long as no major issues arise, it'll probably finish by then.
