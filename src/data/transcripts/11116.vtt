Rapport with the client is critical.

00:06.950 --> 00:08.300
In your point of view, Mark,...

00:08.800 --> 00:13.400
...has informal feedback led to any significant changes in the way you deal with clients?

00:14.100 --> 00:18.150
I think it has made me more diplomatic in dealing with complaints.

00:19.050 --> 00:22.400
I'd like to ask for clarification of what you mean by that.

00:23.050 --> 00:28.350
Let me get a show of hands of the number of people here who have lost their temper dealing with complaints?

00:29.300 --> 00:30.100
Lots of us.

00:30.700 --> 00:32.200
I tended to do that too.

00:32.800 --> 00:37.150
That was because my expectation was that I had to defend the product.

00:37.750 --> 00:43.700
Now I acknowledge the complaint as a situation where the client is offering informal feedback.

00:44.300 --> 00:47.650
Can we afford to ignore informal feedback from our clients?
