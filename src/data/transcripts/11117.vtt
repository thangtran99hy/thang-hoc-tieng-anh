00:01.930 --> 00:04.830
Did you see the memo that is circulating the office?

00:05.400 --> 00:08.840
Do you mean the one about the meeting tomorrow? Yeah, I saw it.

00:09.470 --> 00:11.940
I'm still not sure what the meeting is about.

00:12.340 --> 00:15.680
We're supposed to brainstorm ideas for better sales approaches.

00:15.940 --> 00:18.450
Is it essential that everyone attend the meeting?

00:18.750 --> 00:21.520
I was planning to be out of the office tomorrow afternoon.

00:21.780 --> 00:22.950
Of course, it's important.

00:23.320 --> 00:24.790
Bob is going to chair the meeting.

00:25.055 --> 00:27.820
I think he's going to propose an idea he came up with.

00:28.220 --> 00:31.290
I guess the length of the meeting will be at least a few hours.

00:31.530 --> 00:33.130
I hope we have refreshments.
