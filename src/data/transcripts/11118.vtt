00:02.208 --> 00:04.377
OK. Let's get down to business.

00:04.677 --> 00:07.273
First, I'd like to welcome everybody to today's meeting.

00:07.863 --> 00:11.027
Jeff sends his apologies for his absence from today's meeting.

00:11.245 --> 00:12.176
His son is sick.

00:13.118 --> 00:17.989
The objective of our meeting today is to brainstorm ideas for more effective sales techniques.

00:18.641 --> 00:20.469
That is our target this afternoon.

00:20.885 --> 00:22.933
I have a few ideas I'd like to share first,...

00:23.003 --> 00:26.737
...and then we will go around the table and hear other ideas from each person here today.

00:27.407 --> 00:30.543
We'll try to keep to ten minutes for the discussion of each idea.

00:30.807 --> 00:33.005
That way the meeting won't run too long.

00:33.552 --> 00:36.023
And I've asked Karen to take minutes for the meeting.

00:36.441 --> 00:39.361
So, as background I'd just like to take you...

00:39.462 --> 00:42.267
...through the standard sales techniques used in our department.
