I have a transparency here to illustrate how I organize informal feedback.

00:09.850 --> 00:11.950
I think the OHP is out of focus.

00:12.500 --> 00:13.100
Can you fix it?

00:14.100 --> 00:14.500
Sure.

00:15.350 --> 00:16.850
OK. That looks better.

00:17.650 --> 00:19.050
Where did the pointer go?

00:19.850 --> 00:20.800
Well, never mind.

00:21.100 --> 00:22.400
I can just use my hand.

00:23.300 --> 00:26.300
At first glance, this system may look rather complicated,...

00:26.600 --> 00:28.050
...but it's actually very simple.

00:28.550 --> 00:31.250
Do the different shapes mean types of files?

00:31.750 --> 00:36.500
Actually, the shapes in the diagram represent organization within the file...

00:37.050 --> 00:41.100
...and I would also like to draw your attention to the color coding of the shapes.

00:41.550 --> 00:48.000
The meaning of each color is related to the three situations I described before when informal feedback is given.
