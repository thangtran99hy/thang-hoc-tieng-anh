00:04.200 --> 00:09.450
The next slide we are going to look at shows the fluctuation of sales over the past two years.

00:09.950 --> 00:13.100
Wow! Last quarter we hit quite a slump!

00:13.350 --> 00:14.250
Yes, we did.

00:14.800 --> 00:20.900
And we can see in this graph that sales started to gradually worsen in the last quarter of the last year.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.600
They recovered slightly in the first quarter,...

00:23.850 --> 00:26.700
...but then continued to fall until the present quarter.

00:27.750 --> 00:31.400
Any idea what caused this deterioration in sales?

00:32.350 --> 00:34.500
One significant factor is the economy.

00:35.050 --> 00:37.400
We're not the only ones facing this problem.

00:37.900 --> 00:41.700
But the good news is that I think we've reached a low point,...

00:41.900 --> 00:44.800
...and things are going to improve in the next quarter.
