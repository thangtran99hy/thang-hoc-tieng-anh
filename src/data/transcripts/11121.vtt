Let's take a break before we discuss Sam's ideas further.

00:07.775 --> 00:10.568
You gave a very interesting proposal, Sam.

00:11.094 --> 00:11.848
Thanks, Karen.

00:12.409 --> 00:15.121
I think this new approach has a lot of advantages.

00:15.715 --> 00:17.543
I could tell through the presentation.

00:17.657 --> 00:19.573
You're very enthusiastic about it.

00:20.159 --> 00:22.128
I just hope I convinced the managers.

00:22.599 --> 00:23.981
It's a little risky, you know.

00:24.372 --> 00:27.607
Well, your posture and stance during the presentation...

00:27.683 --> 00:30.846
...communicated your absolute confidence in the proposal.

00:31.495 --> 00:36.101
What about my facial expression when Mike wanted me to go over the statistics again?

00:36.577 --> 00:37.694
You kept smiling.

00:38.042 --> 00:39.207
That was a good thing!
