Would anyone like to comment on that last suggestion?

00:06.201 --> 00:10.753
I totally agree with you, Bob. I can see how it could really help sales.

00:11.481 --> 00:16.903
I think to a certain extent it might work, but perhaps not in the case of every client.

00:17.346 --> 00:20.149
Sometimes clients appreciate a more direct approach.

00:20.744 --> 00:21.462
Karen is right.

00:22.071 --> 00:23.699
I can think of a few cases...

00:23.787 --> 00:27.802
...when clients have reacted negatively to the approach you've outlined, Bob.

00:28.680 --> 00:33.454
Of course I am in favor of using a range of techniques to suit different clients.

00:34.235 --> 00:36.382
Why don't we hear from other people at the table now.

00:36.845 --> 00:38.601
Who else has an idea to share with us?
