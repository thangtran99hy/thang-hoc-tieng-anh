00:01.700 --> 00:04.700
There is no easy way to deal with overdue accounts.

00:05.070 --> 00:08.640
We should set up a committee to reformulate our accounting procedures.

00:09.280 --> 00:13.710
I've often had to clarify our company's policy on payment options for clients.

00:14.080 --> 00:17.650
Some of the procedures are not very clear in company documents.

00:18.030 --> 00:19.850
I think we're getting sidetracked.

00:20.280 --> 00:22.790
We should stick to our original topic of discussion.

00:23.190 --> 00:27.590
Accounting and client payments are outside the scope of this discussion.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.890
Let's focus our discussion on sales techniques.

00:31.390 --> 00:33.720
Maybe we should move on to the next person's ideas.

00:34.130 --> 00:35.730
I believe Linda was next.
