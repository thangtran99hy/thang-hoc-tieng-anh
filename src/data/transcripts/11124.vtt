00:01.700 --> 00:03.600
If I could just interrupt for a moment...

00:04.070 --> 00:08.170
I think Linda has made a good point. Do you want to add something, Mark?

00:08.870 --> 00:13.730
Yes. I'd like to add namely that different clients have different needs.

00:14.410 --> 00:18.780
A few of the suggestions we've heard superficially acknowledge these differences.

00:19.180 --> 00:22.420
But I think if we explore these techniques in more depth,...

00:22.680 --> 00:27.590
...we'll find that they really make all the same assumptions about the needs of our clients.

00:27.960 --> 00:28.930
May I just point out...

00:29.060 --> 00:29.960
Just a minute, Mark.

00:30.420 --> 00:33.600
One at a time, please. We can't all speak at once.

00:34.130 --> 00:34.830
Yes, Linda?
