00:03.400 --> 00:06.900
It would be a real catastrophe to continue business as usual.

00:08.050 --> 00:10.400
I think you're exaggerating the danger a bit.

00:11.300 --> 00:14.900
Without changing our approach, we'll never improve performance.

00:15.250 --> 00:16.300
Sam is right.

00:16.500 --> 00:22.600
If we utilize the new approach in a systematic way, our sales should rocket by early next year.

00:23.250 --> 00:26.150
We need to do more in-depth research on this approach.

00:26.600 --> 00:30.500
We need to balance its strengths and weaknesses before we apply it.

00:30.900 --> 00:34.500
Sam's presentation concentrated too heavily on the benefits.

00:34.850 --> 00:36.400
I want to see the other side.

00:36.900 --> 00:37.800
I disagree.

00:38.150 --> 00:43.900
I thought the presentation was well balanced regarding the positive and negative aspects of the approach.
