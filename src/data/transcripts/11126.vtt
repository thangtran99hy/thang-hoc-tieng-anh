I wanna briefly summarize the benefits of informal feedback.

00:07.550 --> 00:10.700
It can provide more detailed information about clients' needs,...

00:11.050 --> 00:12.700
...it makes clients feel empowered,...

00:13.000 --> 00:15.850
...and it strengthens the customer client relationship.

00:16.400 --> 00:22.600
So to conclude, I would like to recommend that the sales department utilize informal feedback...

00:22.950 --> 00:25.000
...in a more systematic way in the future.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.100
Thank you for your attention.

00:27.450 --> 00:29.350
I expect many of you have questions.

00:29.650 --> 00:33.850
So, I would now like to invite your questions regarding my presentation.
