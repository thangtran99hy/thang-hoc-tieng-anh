If I understand you correctly, you mean the feedback led to larger orders?

00:08.967 --> 00:12.987
Of course, it is difficult to prove a real cause and effect relationship...

00:13.092 --> 00:14.585
...between the feedback and the sales.

00:15.450 --> 00:18.450
Now, you sound like you're hedging on the claims you made before.

00:19.250 --> 00:20.800
Let me make one thing clear.

00:21.250 --> 00:25.800
I am positive informal feedback led to a better relationship with clients...

00:26.550 --> 00:30.600
...and I'll also mention that sales do not depend on the relationship alone,...

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
...but a good relationship certainly doesn't hurt.

00:34.550 --> 00:35.900
I have a question, too.

00:36.350 --> 00:39.500
I didn't follow your organization of feedback files.

00:39.850 --> 00:41.500
Can you repeat that for me, please?
