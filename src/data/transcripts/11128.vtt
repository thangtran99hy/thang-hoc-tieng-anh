So, what did you think of the presentation, Linda?

00:06.200 --> 00:11.100
I think the way you introduced yourself in the greeting really helped break the ice in the meeting.

00:11.650 --> 00:13.450
I wanted everyone to feel relaxed.

00:13.900 --> 00:18.200
And in the body of the presentation, you outlined your points very well.

00:18.550 --> 00:22.350
You stated the information clearly and didn't digress from the topic.

00:23.100 --> 00:25.600
What did you think about the length of the presentation?

00:26.050 --> 00:26.700
It was good.

00:27.050 --> 00:30.900
When you closed, I thought you handled all the questions from the audience well.

00:31.250 --> 00:32.600
Thanks for your feedback, Linda.
