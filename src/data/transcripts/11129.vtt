Have you considered giving a workshop on presentations, Mark?

00:06.800 --> 00:08.050
What are you talking about, Bob?

00:08.300 --> 00:09.200
You must be kidding.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.700
No, bear with me for a minute.

00:12.200 --> 00:15.100
I thought you gave a very dynamic presentation.

00:16.100 --> 00:16.600
Really?

00:17.400 --> 00:20.300
I sensed a bit of hostility during the questions at the end.

00:20.950 --> 00:21.950
Not at all.

00:22.400 --> 00:26.050
I just wanted you to be specific about the value you see in...

00:26.500 --> 00:30.850
Of course I never did any formal analysis of the benefits of informal feedback.

00:31.300 --> 00:32.000
Don't interrupt.

00:32.300 --> 00:38.900
I was trying to tell you the organization, interaction, and professionalism of your presentation were impressive.

00:39.300 --> 00:44.050
Maybe you could contribute some tips to help others here give better presentations.
