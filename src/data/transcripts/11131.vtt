So, those are the best tips I can give you on how to give a presentation.

00:07.450 --> 00:08.300
Any questions?

00:08.800 --> 00:12.100
How can we figure out if we have distracting mannerisms or not?

00:12.550 --> 00:15.950
You have to practice in front of a mirror, watching yourself speak.

00:17.250 --> 00:20.700
What about telling jokes or anecdotes during a presentation?

00:21.000 --> 00:21.900
Is that OK?

00:23.000 --> 00:25.650
Positive jokes are appropriate for presentations.

00:26.300 --> 00:30.200
A good anecdote could be helpful for explaining your point in a presentation.

00:30.650 --> 00:34.900
So, if it helps the clarity of your point, I think an anecdote is fine.

00:35.700 --> 00:40.300
Do you prefer scripted presentations or do you leave room for spontaneity?

00:41.100 --> 00:43.600
Usually, the text from my slides is enough.

00:44.150 --> 00:45.250
I don't write everything.
