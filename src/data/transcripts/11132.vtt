00:02.500 --> 00:06.280
This has had a huge impact on my sales over the last year.

00:06.970 --> 00:10.910
I'm not sure I follow. Could you elaborate on your closing technique?

00:11.570 --> 00:15.650
I don't think it's vital to go over the whole technique in detail at this meeting.

00:16.080 --> 00:22.180
The main point is that the overall approach brings a whole new dynamic to the company client relationship.

00:22.550 --> 00:24.020
Are you with me on that point?

00:24.600 --> 00:28.800
In other words, you deal with clients on a much more personal level.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.100
Exactly!

00:30.690 --> 00:34.630
I'd be interested in exploring this idea more thoroughly at a later meeting.
