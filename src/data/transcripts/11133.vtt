00:02.130 --> 00:06.240
I wish we had more time to spend brainstorming ideas, but it's getting late.

00:06.940 --> 00:09.340
But before we are completely out of time,...

00:09.640 --> 00:15.780
...I'd like to try and come to a consensus on the next step in implementing some of these ideas.

00:16.480 --> 00:21.240
If possible, I would really like to see an outline of all of the ideas from this meeting...

00:21.480 --> 00:25.520
...before deciding on which ones to implement and which ones to reject.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.120
I'm also in favor of that proposal.

00:28.890 --> 00:30.690
Can I get a show of hands on that?

00:31.060 --> 00:31.930
All in favor?

00:32.830 --> 00:34.630
It looks like the idea carries.

00:35.100 --> 00:37.800
Karen will type up the outline from the minutes.
