00:01.900 --> 00:04.890
That covers everything I wanted to accomplish at this meeting.

00:05.460 --> 00:06.400
Just to sum up,...

00:06.800 --> 00:12.260
...Karen will make sure everyone at this meeting gets a copy of the minutes outlining all of the ideas.

00:12.800 --> 00:17.930
Then, we'll meet again next week and look into how some of the ideas can be implemented.

00:18.400 --> 00:22.040
I wanna thank you all for your contribution of stimulating ideas.

00:22.630 --> 00:26.600
I thought this was a very productive meeting. Let's call it a day, folks.
