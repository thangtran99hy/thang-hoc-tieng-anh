Welcome to the 100th anniversary of Jellystone!

00:08.500 --> 00:10.600
I heard you had an unusual brown bear.

00:10.700 --> 00:11.100
Brown bear?

00:11.400 --> 00:13.050
One that talks. Those are so rare.

00:13.150 --> 00:14.100
None that I can think of.

00:14.300 --> 00:15.550
I smell PB and J.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.850
I think he's trying to steal your lunch box.

00:23.550 --> 00:24.100
I'm okay!

00:26.450 --> 00:27.300
Kick it, Boo-Boo.

00:27.550 --> 00:28.100
Kicking it.

00:31.300 --> 00:32.250
We got a bear disturbance.

00:32.300 --> 00:33.500
All units, lock down the park.

00:33.550 --> 00:34.900
Repeat, lock down the park.

00:35.250 --> 00:37.700
Jones, you know I'm the only other ranger here, right?

00:38.600 --> 00:38.950
Yeah.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.650
Bears are supposed to avoid people, not run around stealing their food.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.250
Boo-Boo and I would never think of disturbing a family's picnic.

00:52.050 --> 00:54.200
I wonder if he noticed the pie.

00:56.100 --> 00:58.700
You do come up with some good plans, Yogi.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.450
Here we go!

01:01.500 --> 01:03.900
That's because I'm smarter than the average bear.

01:04.100 --> 01:05.750
Yogi, grab my paw!

01:11.900 --> 01:13.600
I'm so smart it hurts.

01:14.400 --> 01:17.200
Yogi Bear in 3D.

01:18.650 --> 01:20.600
This isn't gonna make me look fat, is it?
