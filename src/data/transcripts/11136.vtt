Hi, Sam. I was just calling to let you know my meeting at work finished on time...

00:07.140 --> 00:09.070
...and I'll be leaving the office soon.

00:09.440 --> 00:13.810
Unfortunately, a problem arose here, so I won't be able to leave for a while.

00:14.210 --> 00:17.780
In addition, we are facing a big deadline coming up Friday,...

00:18.020 --> 00:22.220
...so my boss wants to have a meeting tonight to tackle the root of the problem.

00:22.660 --> 00:26.220
Then, we'll have to postpone tonight's plans with Diane and her boyfriend.

00:26.390 --> 00:30.360
Yeah, it might be better just to reschedule with Diane for next week.

00:30.790 --> 00:35.130
I anticipate this problem will take a few days of working overtime to deal with.
