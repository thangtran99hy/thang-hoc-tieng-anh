00:05.200 --> 00:06.800
In a city of darkness...

00:07.440 --> 00:09.000
...where evil runs free,...

00:09.640 --> 00:10.970
...the people need a hero.

00:14.110 --> 00:14.640
Who am I?

00:17.150 --> 00:18.450
I'm Dragonfly.

00:19.280 --> 00:19.680
Stop!

00:19.890 --> 00:22.050
The story of my life is not for the faint of heart.

00:22.280 --> 00:23.220
Stop the bus!

00:30.000 --> 00:33.430
Seven genetically enhanced super dragonflies.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.000
But there's only six in there.

00:36.430 --> 00:39.400
From the makers of "Scary Movie" and "The Naked Gun"...

00:39.900 --> 00:40.700
There we go.

00:41.240 --> 00:41.970
Uncle Albert!

00:42.070 --> 00:42.340
Rick!

00:43.510 --> 00:44.740
How did you do that?

00:44.810 --> 00:46.370
It's easier than it looks.

00:49.640 --> 00:50.820
Well, I don't think so.

00:51.250 --> 00:53.620
...comes the ultimate superhero movie.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.750
I think I have super powers.

00:56.020 --> 00:59.190
I can walk on walls. I have super strength, super agility.

01:07.830 --> 01:08.460
Honor.

01:09.000 --> 01:09.800
Take cover!

01:10.770 --> 01:11.400
Uncle Albert!

01:11.500 --> 01:13.970
With great power comes great...

01:14.310 --> 01:15.070
Just try to breathe.

01:15.170 --> 01:17.840
I can't. You're kneeling on my crotch.

01:18.570 --> 01:19.240
Family.

01:19.340 --> 01:20.880
Hi, everybody. Take your seat.

01:21.410 --> 01:23.910
Uh-uh-uh! Not 'til we say grace.

01:25.920 --> 01:26.750
Amen!

01:28.820 --> 01:29.720
Sacrifice.

01:29.850 --> 01:31.590
I realize we can never be together.

01:31.720 --> 01:32.790
You love me Rick.

01:33.290 --> 01:34.260
I know you do.

01:34.360 --> 01:35.560
I'm telling you this for your own good.

01:37.890 --> 01:38.690
This spring,...

01:46.100 --> 01:47.900
...if you think you've seen it all,...

01:51.410 --> 01:53.170
...you have no idea.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.880
You just saved that old lady's life.

01:58.950 --> 02:02.150
If I hadn't pushed her out of the way, she would have died.

02:04.690 --> 02:06.190
Superhero Movie.
