Welcome to AERA English's Native Maestro.

00:03.300 --> 00:04.400
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:04.550 --> 00:08.050
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:08.700 --> 00:10.550
Okay, today's Maestro Hook.

00:11.050 --> 00:15.250
Now, today's Maestro Hook is all about the love, and romance, and the dating game.

00:15.800 --> 00:16.750
In Japanese, you say,...

00:17.900 --> 00:19.400
...but in English, it's the dating game.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.800
Now, when you're talking with a foreigner girl and you're also a girl,...

00:24.350 --> 00:27.150
...it's okay to have girl talk, so don't be afraid.

00:27.300 --> 00:29.150
You can ask the girls anything you want.

00:29.550 --> 00:30.900
Anything about relationships.

00:31.150 --> 00:36.250
For example, if you're a girl and you talked to the girl, say: "So, how's your love life?"...

00:36.850 --> 00:38.650
...or, "Do you have anyone special?"

00:39.300 --> 00:40.550
These are very informal.

00:40.600 --> 00:44.700
These are very casual conversations that you can have with people and it's not such taboo.

00:45.150 --> 00:48.000
You can say, "So, how's the dating scene in Tokyo?"...

00:48.300 --> 00:50.650
...or, "How's the dating scene back home for you?"

00:51.200 --> 00:54.550
So the dating game, you can talk about anything if you're a girl with a girl.

00:54.800 --> 00:58.650
Now be careful, if you're a guy and a girl, there might be some boundaries,...

00:58.950 --> 01:02.900
...but if it's a girl asking a guy in Tokyo, I think that's not a problem either.

01:03.300 --> 01:07.500
So, Western people are very open about relationships, so it's something you can talk about.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.000
Alright, today's Maestro Menu.

01:17.350 --> 01:18.400
He's on the market.

01:35.250 --> 01:36.550
Oh! He's on the market.

01:45.350 --> 01:45.750
Okay.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.300
He's taken.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.100
He's taken.

02:03.950 --> 02:06.450
Okay. So, Maestro Lines.

02:11.400 --> 02:13.800
Wow! That guy is really attractive.

02:14.500 --> 02:16.250
Oh, yeah! He's on the market.

02:16.450 --> 02:17.350
You should go for him.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.250
Oh, wow! That guy is very attractive.

02:24.700 --> 02:26.500
Oh, too bad! He's taken.
