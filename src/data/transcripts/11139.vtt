00:03.766 --> 00:05.755
I've got something very important to tell you.

00:06.393 --> 00:08.527
Something we can't keep quiet any longer.

00:10.320 --> 00:12.861
We felt it was time the people knew.

00:14.061 --> 00:17.750
Nike Air is actually the air of our very best athletes.

00:18.873 --> 00:21.986
We've been collecting athletes' air for over 30 years now.

00:23.101 --> 00:23.759
Come with me.

00:27.138 --> 00:29.364
Welcome to the Air Collection Unit.

00:30.324 --> 00:33.846
This is where we collect the air from our athletes to put it in the shoe.

00:35.684 --> 00:36.246
Hey, Troy!

00:38.145 --> 00:38.760
Hey, Carl!

00:39.161 --> 00:39.329
Hey!

00:40.579 --> 00:40.944
How's she doing?

00:41.091 --> 00:42.665
Oh! I tell you, these young kids are something else.

00:42.797 --> 00:44.063
Oh, come on! Don't be so humble.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.295
You're still delivering great triple A air.

00:48.695 --> 00:49.683
Come on, B-Roy!

00:50.264 --> 00:50.568
Dude!

00:50.699 --> 00:51.542
Time to give air.

00:51.889 --> 00:52.303
Alright!

00:58.004 --> 00:59.532
Hey, Paula! All yours?

00:59.920 --> 01:01.033
Yup, all mine.

01:02.970 --> 01:03.540
Girl power!

01:04.654 --> 01:06.669
Okay, guys! We're about to meet Maria Sharapova.

01:06.799 --> 01:07.568
Don't be weird.

01:08.524 --> 01:12.594
You simply walk up and you say, "Hi, Maria! You're beautiful."

01:13.252 --> 01:13.939
No, don't say that!

01:19.580 --> 01:20.323
Hey, P-Rod!

01:20.950 --> 01:21.556
Hi, Maria!

01:21.939 --> 01:22.831
Was that a "Switch"?

01:22.993 --> 01:23.453
Yeah.

01:27.624 --> 01:28.224
Hey, Paulie!

01:30.461 --> 01:31.717
Easy, Sharpie.

01:31.905 --> 01:33.568
They tell me my air is really special.

01:34.070 --> 01:34.941
It's special, alright.

01:35.249 --> 01:36.379
It's an extra step for us.

01:36.628 --> 01:38.627
I had to develop a grunt removal system.

01:39.079 --> 01:39.532
Before...

01:40.901 --> 01:41.395
...and after.

01:45.349 --> 01:47.063
So, why tell you all of this now?

01:47.175 --> 01:49.019
We just couldn't keep it under wraps anymore.

01:49.235 --> 01:50.771
Our athletes are becoming stronger.

01:50.860 --> 01:52.615
Their air is getting stronger.

01:52.819 --> 01:53.339
Help!

01:54.869 --> 01:55.507
Help!

01:55.600 --> 01:59.963
It's great that even now, my air is being used by Nike to help kids perform better.

02:00.389 --> 02:02.624
I work really hard to put my air into these shoes.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.880
So if you could please take good care of them.

02:05.113 --> 02:09.801
Technically, we collect your air in canisters and then we put it in the shoes.

02:10.386 --> 02:10.914
I know that.

02:11.797 --> 02:12.415
Of course, you know that.

02:12.810 --> 02:13.516
Well, there you have it.

02:14.211 --> 02:17.875
Nike Air is actually the air of our very best athletes.

02:21.117 --> 02:22.772
Please treat with caution.
