00:00.712 --> 00:02.273
Imagine what your neighbors would say...

00:02.382 --> 00:05.481
...if they saw you driving a vehicle like this down the street.

00:06.463 --> 00:08.833
There's definitely a lot of James Bond appeal.

00:10.203 --> 00:14.606
Often referred to as the flying car, the Transition is a one of a kind,...

00:14.752 --> 00:18.609
...two passenger aircraft that can retract its wings to drive on the road.

00:19.211 --> 00:22.208
Transforming from plane to car takes only 30 seconds.

00:22.795 --> 00:25.544
I wanna pull up somebody's driveway and unfold the wings...

00:25.904 --> 00:28.329
...and have an airplane in their driveway and wonder how it got there.

00:28.491 --> 00:30.059
In both car and plane mode...

00:30.324 --> 00:33.916
...the vehicle is powered by unleaded gasoline from a regular gas station...

00:34.256 --> 00:36.864
...eliminating the need for pricier aviation fuel.

00:37.671 --> 00:40.135
This will help make the Transition one of the greenest,...

00:40.332 --> 00:43.053
...most environmentally friendly airplanes in the world.

00:43.879 --> 00:47.545
If you can keep this thing in your garage like you can keep your SUV in your garage,...

00:48.180 --> 00:52.113
...but you can fly through the air at twice the speed of your SUV...

00:52.602 --> 00:55.533
...and get twice the gas mileage of your SUV.

00:55.887 --> 00:59.032
Now that the Transition has proven it can take off and land smoothly,...

00:59.458 --> 01:01.839
...engineers are continuing extensive tests...

01:02.197 --> 01:05.917
...with plans to deliver the first vehicles to customers in 2011.
