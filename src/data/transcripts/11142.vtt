So Linda, I'd like to get your opinion of how the meeting went.

00:05.610 --> 00:10.480
I thought it went very well. You had a clear goal and you stuck to it.

00:10.810 --> 00:13.860
Brainstorming suggestions was the only thing on the agenda.

00:14.280 --> 00:17.880
I think it also helped that you prepared your own suggestion to start with.

00:18.380 --> 00:22.590
That got people thinking before you went around the table to hear other people's views...

00:23.050 --> 00:27.390
...and I would add that your organization kept the meeting from running over time.

00:27.560 --> 00:32.090
Thanks, Linda. I feel we made real progress today with our sales strategy.
