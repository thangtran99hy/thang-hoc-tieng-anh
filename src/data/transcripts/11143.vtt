What was my most difficult meeting?

00:05.070 --> 00:08.800
Probably the contract meeting I attended on a business trip to Japan.

00:09.350 --> 00:12.270
I bet that meeting required a lot of diplomacy.

00:12.980 --> 00:17.210
The hard part was trying to figure out how to behave. It was very frustrating.

00:17.610 --> 00:20.180
Did you do anything to offend someone at the meeting?

00:20.650 --> 00:21.620
I don't think so.

00:21.850 --> 00:26.880
But it was awkward greeting people by exchanging business cards instead of giving them a handshake.

00:27.390 --> 00:30.460
And there was a lot more silence at the meeting than I am used to.

00:30.760 --> 00:32.500
It was all very foreign to me.
