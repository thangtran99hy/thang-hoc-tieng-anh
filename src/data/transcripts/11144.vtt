00:02.500 --> 00:03.450
Good afternoon.

00:03.650 --> 00:05.600
I have an appointment with Mr. Miller.

00:07.250 --> 00:08.300
Please, take a seat.

00:08.550 --> 00:11.250
Mr. Miller is taking a conference call at the moment.

00:12.300 --> 00:13.900
Mr. Miller, are you free?

00:14.700 --> 00:15.800
You may go in now.

00:17.300 --> 00:18.700
How do you do, Miss...

00:18.950 --> 00:20.700
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.

00:21.000 --> 00:21.950
Linda Strait.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.300
Please call me Linda.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.000
A pleasure to meet you, Linda.

00:25.400 --> 00:29.300
I hope you have a chance to look around our beautiful city before you fly back.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.600
How was the flight coming here, by the way?

00:31.950 --> 00:32.800
It was fine.

00:33.200 --> 00:37.700
I thought I might be late because the flight was delayed by the miserable weather back home.

00:38.050 --> 00:40.900
But the pilot somehow managed to make up the time.
