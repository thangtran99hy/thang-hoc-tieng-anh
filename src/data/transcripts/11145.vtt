The most important thing about chairing a meeting is to have clarity of purpose.

00:06.740 --> 00:10.140
I can see how that can help the chair organize the agenda.

00:10.580 --> 00:13.380
And it can also help the chair keep the meeting on track.

00:13.810 --> 00:15.290
When discussion takes place,...

00:15.420 --> 00:21.590
...a clear objective guarantees the chair can tell when topics of irrelevance are taking up too much time.

00:22.020 --> 00:25.260
And that's when the chair needs to use her or his authority...

00:25.420 --> 00:28.260
...to cut off the discussion and refocus the meeting.

00:28.620 --> 00:33.560
Yes, but the chair shouldn't bully the participants or dominate the discussion.
