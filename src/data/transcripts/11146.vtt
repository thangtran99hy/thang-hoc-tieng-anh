Actually, I'm learning English because it will be helpful for my career.

00:08.870 --> 00:13.850
I'm learning English because first of all, I want to be a teacher of English in my country.

00:15.080 --> 00:23.120
I would like to work for some companies who work in Canada and USA...

00:24.461 --> 00:28.695
...and they need really good English skills,...

00:30.051 --> 00:34.325
...and I have to speak English very well, and work for them.

00:35.430 --> 00:39.400
Well, I believe that English is very important nowadays...

00:40.740 --> 00:49.950
...as you cannot continue studying without using English 'cause it's the international language nowadays.

00:50.950 --> 00:54.220
I'm learning English because I love it.

00:55.820 --> 01:01.890
I love the English culture, the American culture, its movie, its music.

01:03.230 --> 01:06.430
English is a world language, so we need to study English.

01:07.130 --> 01:11.255
It's essential and personally, I wanna be a politician...

01:11.762 --> 01:15.323
...or I wanna be a diplomat, which my father wants.

01:15.700 --> 01:22.880
So, I think English is the most important thing for a politician or a diplomat.
