00:03.100 --> 00:04.550
We've been at this all afternoon.

00:04.850 --> 00:06.750
Let's take a break and go out for coffee.

00:07.150 --> 00:09.300
That sounds like a good idea.

00:09.850 --> 00:13.150
I know a great coffee shop down the street if you don't mind walking a bit.

00:13.450 --> 00:14.250
Not at all.

00:14.850 --> 00:16.850
Oh! Look at the rain!

00:17.000 --> 00:18.500
It's pouring outside!

00:18.800 --> 00:20.200
That's typical around here.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.550
It rains almost every day in this time of year.

00:23.100 --> 00:25.350
It's a shame you couldn't see the city in the spring.

00:25.700 --> 00:27.250
The weather is much nicer then.

00:27.550 --> 00:29.800
But I don't have an umbrella or anything.

00:29.950 --> 00:31.000
How annoying!

00:31.250 --> 00:31.850
Don't worry.

00:32.150 --> 00:34.100
We keep extras here in the office.
