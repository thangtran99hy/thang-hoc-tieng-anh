This coffee shop is wonderful.

00:04.700 --> 00:06.000
Thanks for bringing me here.

00:06.450 --> 00:07.400
My pleasure, Linda.

00:07.850 --> 00:10.900
So, Bob tells me you joined the company recently.

00:11.150 --> 00:11.800
That's right.

00:12.300 --> 00:16.300
I started applying for jobs last January and was hired in March.

00:16.900 --> 00:18.300
What did you do before that?

00:18.700 --> 00:21.100
Before that, I was a freelance consultant.

00:21.400 --> 00:24.550
Really? I heard consultants earn great salaries.

00:24.950 --> 00:26.050
Why did you quit that?

00:26.350 --> 00:29.100
It was too stressful moving from job to job.

00:29.450 --> 00:30.850
I wanted steadier work...

00:31.250 --> 00:35.400
...and I have found the work I'm involved in now is very interesting and exciting.
