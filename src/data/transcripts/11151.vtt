I have a contract negotiation coming up this week, Linda.

00:06.630 --> 00:10.280
It might be a good idea for you to sit in to see the procedure.

00:11.070 --> 00:15.310
That sounds very interesting. Who is the other party in this negotiation?

00:15.980 --> 00:17.350
One of our suppliers.

00:17.680 --> 00:21.780
The company wants to renegotiate the contract we initially signed with them.

00:22.220 --> 00:24.120
What kind of deal are they looking for?

00:24.590 --> 00:28.220
I was informed that the company will only extend their contract with us...

00:28.490 --> 00:31.090
...if we agree to pay them a higher fee.

00:31.630 --> 00:33.260
They didn't specify how much,...

00:33.660 --> 00:37.670
...so the agenda of the negotiation will include bargaining on the new fee.
