00:03.300 --> 00:06.800
Has our company had a long-term relationship with the other party?

00:07.340 --> 00:09.800
Our history together goes back several years.

00:10.210 --> 00:15.310
In any case, I fully expect these negotiations to turn out as a win-win settlement.

00:15.880 --> 00:19.050
That company is small and depends on commission from us,...

00:19.380 --> 00:22.160
...and we also get a good discount on orders.

00:22.580 --> 00:25.690
You seem pretty confident the negotiations will go well.

00:25.990 --> 00:29.160
I'm sure we can come up with a mutually beneficial agreement.

00:29.430 --> 00:32.260
Has management established any conditions for you to meet?

00:32.830 --> 00:35.160
I have the basis for a contract outlined,...

00:35.460 --> 00:40.970
...but management did leave me some room to make concessions in case I need to haggle in the deal.
