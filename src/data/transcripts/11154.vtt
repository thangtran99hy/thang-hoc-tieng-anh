00:03.500 --> 00:06.200
Good afternoon, Roger. It's nice to see you again.

00:06.670 --> 00:09.740
Allow me to introduce Linda Strait, a colleague of mine.

00:10.070 --> 00:12.570
She'll be sitting in on our negotiations.

00:13.380 --> 00:14.880
Delighted to meet you, Linda.

00:15.240 --> 00:18.750
Likewise. Can I offer you some coffee or tea, Roger?

00:19.080 --> 00:20.330
No, thanks. I'm fine.

00:20.820 --> 00:25.720
So, Bob, I heard William took over as head of personnel here at your company.

00:26.330 --> 00:31.590
That's right. William left sales, so now I'm in charge of these contract negotiations.

00:32.160 --> 00:35.360
Since we've got a full agenda today, should we get started?
