"California Gurls"?

00:02.950 --> 00:05.150
I wish they all could be...

00:05.800 --> 00:07.250
No, it's a new one.

00:07.750 --> 00:08.700
A new song?

00:08.800 --> 00:11.700
Yes. Katy Perry and Snoop Dogg...

00:11.900 --> 00:12.300
Uh-huh!

00:13.500 --> 00:15.650
...and it's just kind of like a song about the West Coast.

00:15.700 --> 00:17.800
See, Snoop Dogg is like my generation.

00:18.000 --> 00:18.400
Oh, really?

00:18.700 --> 00:19.950
He's coming back, I guess.

00:20.000 --> 00:20.200
Yeah.

00:20.650 --> 00:21.200
Are you surprised?

00:21.300 --> 00:22.550
And how is it then?

00:23.250 --> 00:27.550
So, Snoop Dogg... you recommend this song "California Gurls" by Katy Perry and Snoop Dogg?

00:27.700 --> 00:28.050
Yeah.

00:29.550 --> 00:30.600
The lyrics are just kind of like,...

00:30.800 --> 00:34.300
...her lyrics are kind of like, different, you know, like "I Kissed a Girl" and stuff like that...

00:34.350 --> 00:40.350
...or just kind of like, different, extreme, sort of like, in the whole America sense thing, but...

00:41.950 --> 00:47.600
...it goes like, "California girls, we're unforgettable."

00:48.050 --> 00:53.100
"Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top. Sun-kissed skin, so hot we'll melt your popsicle."

00:54.050 --> 00:56.450
Awesome, "We'll melt your popsicle", good luck translating that.

00:59.450 --> 00:59.900
Awesome!

01:00.400 --> 01:01.700
Well, thanks so much for the interview.

01:01.750 --> 01:02.200
Thank you!

01:02.250 --> 01:09.050
And as a member of the Japanese listening public, we just want you to know, you're ill!

01:09.850 --> 01:10.450
You're ill!

01:10.550 --> 01:11.300
You're pretty ill also.

01:11.550 --> 01:14.050
Thanks! We should both go to the hospital.

01:14.200 --> 01:14.750
Yeah!
