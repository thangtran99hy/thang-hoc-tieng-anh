00:02.530 --> 00:05.030
May I suggest the procedure for today's meeting?

00:05.740 --> 00:06.340
Certainly.

00:06.970 --> 00:11.140
I assume you've brought the outline for the contract terms your company prefers.

00:11.610 --> 00:14.940
Of course, we've drawn up some contract terms of our own.

00:15.250 --> 00:20.950
So, after we both run through the proposals, we can concentrate on the areas that don't agree.

00:21.280 --> 00:22.720
Does that sound alright with you?

00:23.350 --> 00:24.520
That sounds fine.

00:25.190 --> 00:30.580
Since Linda is sitting in on our negotiations, I've also asked her to take minutes for us.

00:30.930 --> 00:35.200
So, at this point, I think we're ready to hear the new contract terms.
