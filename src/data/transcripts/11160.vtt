I noticed signs around town advertising the touring production of the musical "Ghost of the Opera House".

00:09.600 --> 00:11.800
Yes, it's in town right now.

00:12.200 --> 00:12.800
Have you seen it?

00:13.200 --> 00:15.900
I caught the premiere of the show on Broadway a few years ago.

00:16.150 --> 00:19.800
Really? You saw it when Vera Wilson played the lead?

00:20.250 --> 00:22.500
I heard that was an excellent production.

00:22.850 --> 00:25.050
The critics gave it rave reviews.

00:25.250 --> 00:26.100
It was great.

00:26.500 --> 00:30.700
The plot was predictable, but the whole cast gave an outstanding performance...

00:31.050 --> 00:33.350
...and the scenery in the show was amazing!
