00:02.470 --> 00:05.700
So, if I may summarize your company's position,...

00:05.970 --> 00:10.210
...the new contract would require us to guarantee a higher annual order.

00:10.910 --> 00:11.870
That's right!

00:12.170 --> 00:14.630
As you can see from the figure we've calculated,...

00:14.940 --> 00:21.050
...in order to deliver at the current discount rate, we need a minimum order of 10,000 units.

00:21.850 --> 00:25.190
Of course, we are sympathetic to the position your company is in.

00:25.490 --> 00:30.460
However, there are certain factors needing consideration on our end as well.

00:30.730 --> 00:35.560
For example, we have to take into account the growth we expect in sales next year.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.300
The greater cost of the order is really of secondary importance to us.
