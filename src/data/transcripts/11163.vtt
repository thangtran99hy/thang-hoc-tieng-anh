Hi! I'm Anna Bernstein, founder of the Brain-Voice Connection.

00:09.533 --> 00:11.711
A question that people should be asking me...

00:12.236 --> 00:15.607
...is, "How can I lead a teleconference with authority?"

00:16.691 --> 00:18.711
You know, there's really just a few simple rules...

00:19.057 --> 00:22.390
...for taking a teleconference and making it a fabulous experience.

00:22.879 --> 00:25.319
First of all, you have to be willing to take charge.

00:25.763 --> 00:28.428
At the very outset, you run through the agenda.

00:28.954 --> 00:32.062
You let people know that you will be watching the time.

00:32.790 --> 00:36.109
You have to say you'll cut them off if they go over too much.

00:36.907 --> 00:40.213
The next thing is always use their names when addressing them.

00:40.705 --> 00:44.970
Some people are in the room, but the ones on the phone don't know who you're referring to.

00:45.811 --> 00:47.027
A little tip that I like...

00:47.463 --> 00:50.825
...is try to have pictures of the people who aren't there in the room with you.

00:51.435 --> 00:54.851
That way, people have something to look at while that person is speaking.

00:55.829 --> 01:01.197
Finally, consider the teleconference an incredible opportunity to sound like a leader.

01:02.035 --> 01:04.905
If this is a presentation you're making to a prospect,...

01:05.473 --> 01:08.626
...the fact that you have taken charge during this teleconference...

01:09.121 --> 01:12.165
...demonstrates your leadership abilities for the project ahead.

01:12.993 --> 01:17.218
Don't be afraid to step in and show them that you're the one that can run things.
