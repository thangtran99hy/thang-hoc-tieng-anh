I think the point and true value of brainstorming is often overlooked.

00:04.470 --> 00:07.900
In our innovation process, it's the single most powerful tool that we use.

00:08.270 --> 00:13.510
The first point of value that brainstorming gives us is that it allows us to create a huge volume of ideas...

00:13.740 --> 00:15.080
...at the beginning of our process.

00:15.520 --> 00:19.620
And improvisors really understand that we need to create a ton of ideas in order to find a few...

00:19.990 --> 00:22.930
...exceptionally innovative ideas that can actually be implemented.

00:23.450 --> 00:26.050
We use brainstorming to fill our idea pot,...

00:26.360 --> 00:29.660
...to give us the ammunition and the fuel we need to move forward.

00:30.030 --> 00:34.710
Brainstorming allows us to gather all of the different and diverse points of view at the top of our process too.

00:35.070 --> 00:38.470
We absolutely know that the more diverse we can be at the top of our process,...

00:38.830 --> 00:41.270
...the more robust and innovative our solution will be.

00:41.810 --> 00:44.300
We use brainstorming to kick-start our process.

00:44.400 --> 00:48.540
It's the rocket fuel that propels us towards the next great innovative idea.
