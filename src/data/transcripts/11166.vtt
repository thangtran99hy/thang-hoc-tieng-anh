00:03.100 --> 00:05.900
Do you think this recession can get much worse?

00:06.300 --> 00:07.150
On the contrary,...

00:07.550 --> 00:09.250
...I see signs of a recovery.

00:09.700 --> 00:12.050
The inflation rate has been steadily declining,...

00:12.500 --> 00:14.550
...and the unemployment rate is also low.

00:15.050 --> 00:20.700
But I've also heard reports that lots of companies will continue to downsize over the next few years.

00:21.250 --> 00:24.800
That may be true, but I don't think the recession is the cause.

00:25.250 --> 00:29.100
Companies are restructuring and laying off people in redundant positions.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.700
And they're also outsourcing more work,...

00:32.000 --> 00:34.750
...so they need fewer permanent staff on the payroll.
