Let me see if I have this correct.

00:05.341 --> 00:09.326
From your point of view, it's more important to order the units you need...

00:09.563 --> 00:11.673
...rather than to get the cheapest price.

00:12.606 --> 00:12.930
Right.

00:13.486 --> 00:16.821
Most importantly, we don't want to keep a lot of back stock...

00:17.309 --> 00:21.737
...and we're prepared to suffer a slight increase in cost for orders if necessary.

00:22.601 --> 00:25.119
Then, may I suggest an alternative proposal.

00:26.191 --> 00:29.491
With your past orders ranging between 600 and 800 units,...

00:30.027 --> 00:33.199
...I would propose setting the discount rate 3% lower.

00:33.847 --> 00:35.219
Would you be willing to accept that?

00:36.383 --> 00:40.553
Before I respond to that offer, let me do a few calculations of my own.
