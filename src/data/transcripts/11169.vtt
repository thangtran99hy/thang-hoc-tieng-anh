I hate traveling for business.

00:05.100 --> 00:07.100
I always seem to come down with something.

00:07.600 --> 00:10.250
I've heard it's easy to catch a cold from flying.

00:10.650 --> 00:11.800
A cold wouldn't bother me.

00:12.300 --> 00:14.300
When I get sick, it's worse than that.

00:14.750 --> 00:17.850
Like on my last business trip, I got food poisoning!

00:18.150 --> 00:19.300
That's terrible!

00:19.700 --> 00:21.900
Are you sure it wasn't just an upset stomach?

00:22.150 --> 00:23.800
No, it was food poisoning.

00:24.350 --> 00:27.250
At first, I thought it was the flu, so I went to the doctor.

00:27.600 --> 00:30.200
But he diagnosed it as severe food poisoning.

00:30.700 --> 00:35.250
Luckily, he gave me a prescription that worked great and I could still get some work done.
