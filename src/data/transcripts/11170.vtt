00:01.600 --> 00:06.270
Let me reiterate, if you guarantee a minimum order, the discount is higher.

00:07.100 --> 00:11.940
We understand, but we have to consider realistic expectations of our market.

00:12.640 --> 00:19.010
What would be the minimum acceptable order to receive an 8.5% discount on the total order?

00:19.620 --> 00:21.960
We'd be willing to offer that kind of discount...

00:22.220 --> 00:27.160
...with the proviso that your company guaranteed an order of 800 units.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.560
I think our company could go along with that.

00:31.130 --> 00:32.690
Then, do we have a deal?
