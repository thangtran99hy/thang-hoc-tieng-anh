00:03.770 --> 00:06.470
Let's take a look at the terms of the rest of the contract.

00:06.900 --> 00:09.710
I want to make sure there are no other sticking points.

00:10.810 --> 00:14.620
Now that we've found common ground on the annual order of minimum units,...

00:15.030 --> 00:18.680
...I can't think of any other potential problems we would need to overcome.

00:19.520 --> 00:25.440
What about this clause about your company's responsibility in the case of failure to deliver orders on time?

00:26.390 --> 00:31.030
I'm willing to negotiate that clause as long as your demands aren't unrealistic.

00:32.330 --> 00:37.300
Once we achieve agreement on this clause, I think all of the obstacles will be resolved.
