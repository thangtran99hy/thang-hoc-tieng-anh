Every Friday after work, a group from the office goes out for Happy Hour.

00:06.450 --> 00:08.600
I was wondering if you'd like to join us this evening.

00:08.950 --> 00:10.050
I'd be delighted.

00:10.250 --> 00:10.900
Thank you.

00:11.450 --> 00:16.050
Happy Hour starts at 5, we'll leave the office a little early. Say 4:50?

00:16.450 --> 00:17.800
That sounds fine with me.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.800
Where exactly do you go?

00:20.250 --> 00:24.000
There is a bar and grill across the street that an old friend recommended to me.

00:24.500 --> 00:28.300
The food there is great and the atmosphere is very relaxed and informal.

00:28.850 --> 00:31.000
Great! I'm looking forward to it.
