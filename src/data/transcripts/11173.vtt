How are you enjoying the Happy Hour, Linda?

00:03.900 --> 00:05.100
It's wonderful!

00:05.350 --> 00:07.000
All of the food is delicious.

00:07.150 --> 00:10.900
Yeah. My favorites are the stuffed eggplant and cocktail shrimp.

00:11.450 --> 00:13.900
The grilled zucchini is also very tasty.

00:14.350 --> 00:16.200
I noticed you didn't try the chicken wings.

00:16.800 --> 00:17.800
Are you a vegetarian?

00:18.150 --> 00:20.800
No, but I try to avoid fatty foods.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.600
And besides, they looked really spicy.

00:24.350 --> 00:25.350
We should order drinks.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.050
How about some wine, Linda?

00:27.600 --> 00:28.650
Here is the wine list.
