Welcome home, honey!

00:03.923 --> 00:04.685
How was your trip?

00:04.919 --> 00:06.462
It was very good.

00:06.701 --> 00:09.837
It gave me a new perspective on the behavior of managers.

00:10.300 --> 00:11.122
What do you mean?

00:11.405 --> 00:15.451
Mr. Miller has a very interesting attitude regarding his position.

00:15.769 --> 00:17.653
The office hierarchy is the same,...

00:18.006 --> 00:21.425
...but he seems to have a much closer personal bond with his employees.

00:21.727 --> 00:24.569
And he has a genuine sensitivity and respect...

00:24.655 --> 00:27.907
...for how employees divide their work time and personal time.
