I think that ties up all the loose ends with the contract.

00:06.370 --> 00:10.510
After your company draws up the final contract based on the new terms we've agreed on,...

00:10.910 --> 00:14.740
...I'll have my superiors go over it before we officially ratify it.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.050
Of course.

00:16.510 --> 00:19.780
And it's probably a good idea to have the legal departments...

00:19.920 --> 00:22.620
...of both sides run over the contract again.

00:23.470 --> 00:27.820
I was a bit surprised at how fast we made progress to reach a final agreement.

00:28.730 --> 00:32.290
That just reflects the type of relationship our companies have.

00:33.030 --> 00:37.030
I think we've put together a good deal that suits both sides.
