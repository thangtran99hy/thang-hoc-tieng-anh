00:02.930 --> 00:06.140
Do you have any observations about how the negotiations went?

00:06.540 --> 00:10.970
Well, I didn't have much background about past negotiations with the company,...

00:11.270 --> 00:14.530
...but on the basis of my experience, it went very well.

00:15.080 --> 00:19.030
I didn't anticipate any major obstacles going into the negotiations.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.520
We've always managed to make good deals with them in the past.

00:22.960 --> 00:27.060
From my point of view, it seemed both sides were willing to bargain from the outset.

00:27.420 --> 00:30.000
And another factor that helped make quick progress...

00:30.190 --> 00:34.100
...was outlining each party's ideal terms as the meeting got started.
