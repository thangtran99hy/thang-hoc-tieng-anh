Next week, I'll be one of the negotiators involved in ironing out a proposition...

00:08.000 --> 00:10.820
...to form a partnership with a distributor in Taiwan.

00:11.440 --> 00:14.940
Do you have much experience in negotiating with Taiwanese business?

00:15.280 --> 00:19.520
Not really. I've been briefed on some aspects of Taiwan's business culture.

00:20.050 --> 00:24.690
Formality is going to be the biggest issue for me in those negotiations.

00:25.250 --> 00:29.470
It probably won't be too difficult to adapt your normal negotiating tactics.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.300
No doubt, they have studied American culture...

00:32.430 --> 00:36.130
...and expect you to employ certain strategies during the negotiations.
