...than we know about theirs.

00:08.927 --> 00:10.684
Are you worried about confusion...

00:10.798 --> 00:14.588
...when you try to communicate with the representatives from Taiwan in English?

00:15.110 --> 00:17.850
Of course I should be sensitive to the language I use,...

00:18.210 --> 00:23.650
...but I'm sure the company has identified their best English speakers to send to the negotiations.

00:24.090 --> 00:27.360
Will this be a preliminary session for the proposed partnership?

00:27.790 --> 00:31.140
Uh-huh. We're simply going to outline a few ideas.

00:31.390 --> 00:35.130
Later, we'll work out the details of the whole package for the deal.
