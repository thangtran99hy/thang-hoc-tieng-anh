Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:04.550 --> 00:05.700
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:06.050 --> 00:09.050
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:09.600 --> 00:13.150
So today, once again, we're at my good friend's English school.

00:13.550 --> 00:16.000
The place is called Coper and it's in Azabujuban.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.300
So, Imran. Hey!

00:17.350 --> 00:18.800
Hey, Seita! How's it going?

00:19.050 --> 00:19.550
Good, good.

00:19.900 --> 00:21.050
So, this is a good place you've got.

00:21.100 --> 00:21.800
Yeah, thanks a lot!

00:22.450 --> 00:24.300
Tell me. So, what kind of people come to your school?

00:24.400 --> 00:26.550
Actually, we have a lot of different students who come here.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.400
We have working men and women.

00:28.900 --> 00:33.950
We have a doctor, a lawyer, an actress, and a dancer.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.100
Wow! That's a diverse group of people.

00:36.200 --> 00:36.600
It's a lot.

00:37.750 --> 00:40.750
Okay. So, would you like to go in?

00:41.300 --> 00:41.800
Thanks!

00:42.500 --> 00:44.000
And please have a seat.

00:45.200 --> 00:45.850
Alright, thanks!

00:48.900 --> 00:53.850
Okay. So today, I'm thinking of doing a variation of "thanks".

00:54.500 --> 00:58.650
So, today's Menu is "thanks" and two variations.

00:59.400 --> 01:06.000
Okay. The first one is just the regular "Thanks!", okay?

01:06.300 --> 01:12.500
And the second one, "Thanks, but no thanks!"

01:15.000 --> 01:20.050
And the third one is, "Thanks anyway!"

01:22.900 --> 01:26.800
Okay. So, let me explain to you how we would use these three expressions.

01:26.950 --> 01:28.850
"Thanks!" in Japanese would be,...

01:30.500 --> 01:34.500
And the second one, "Thanks, but no thanks!" would be, in Japanese,...

01:37.500 --> 01:41.100
Okay. And the third one, "Thanks anyway!" in Japanese would be,...

01:43.250 --> 01:48.300
Okay. So, I'll show you how we would use these three expressions, okay?

01:48.500 --> 01:50.050
So Seita, could you help me with this?

01:50.100 --> 01:51.200
Yeah, no problem.

01:51.500 --> 01:54.700
Okay. So, the first one. Okay, we'll practice the first one.

01:55.450 --> 01:57.300
Wow, Seita! That's a very nice jacket.

01:57.600 --> 01:58.700
Oh, thanks!

01:59.900 --> 02:03.000
Okay. So, that's how you use the first "Thanks!"

02:03.850 --> 02:06.850
The second one now, "Thanks, but no thanks!"

02:08.050 --> 02:09.900
Okay. So Seita, would you help me with this, too?

02:09.950 --> 02:10.800
Yeah, no problem.

02:12.100 --> 02:15.350
Actually, we're running short of teachers.

02:15.850 --> 02:17.200
Would you mind working for us?

02:18.000 --> 02:19.350
You know what, I already have a job.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.550
Thanks, but no thanks!

02:22.100 --> 02:25.100
Okay. So, that was the second one, "Thanks, but no thanks!"

02:25.450 --> 02:27.900
Now, the third one, "Thanks anyway!"

02:29.100 --> 02:29.700
Okay, Seita.

02:30.000 --> 02:30.250
Yeah?

02:31.800 --> 02:33.600
Would you like to go out for lunch after this?

02:33.850 --> 02:36.800
Oh! You know what, I have a meeting after this. Thanks anyway!

02:38.600 --> 02:42.750
Okay. So, those are three ways you can use "thanks".

02:42.800 --> 02:45.050
The first one, "Thanks!" in Japanese again would be,...

02:46.250 --> 02:47.500
..."Thanks, but no thanks!",...

02:50.450 --> 02:51.650
...and "Thanks anyway!",...

02:53.400 --> 02:53.850
Okay?

02:55.150 --> 02:58.700
Don't just remember these expressions. You've gotta use them.

03:00.400 --> 03:03.000
You can go to an English school and try using these expressions...

03:03.050 --> 03:08.050
...or find a friend, a foreign friend and try to use these expressions.

03:08.100 --> 03:13.150
And frankly, I think that you would be able to use these expressions every time.

03:13.900 --> 03:16.700
Not all of them at the same time but, you know, any one of them,...

03:17.250 --> 03:21.500
...when you go to an English school, take a lesson, or when you meet your friends.

03:22.050 --> 03:24.350
Okay. So, please remember these three expressions...

03:24.850 --> 03:28.150
...and I hope to see you sometime again.

03:28.550 --> 03:29.750
Alright. See you, bye!
