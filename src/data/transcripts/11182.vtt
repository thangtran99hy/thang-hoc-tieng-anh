00:02.633 --> 00:04.850
Are you preparing for a big test?

00:05.300 --> 00:10.117
If so, you may want to go play some basketball in between hitting the books.

00:10.533 --> 00:13.517
Based on information they have collected over the years,...

00:13.900 --> 00:19.050
...researchers have seen an apparent connection between exercise and brain development.

00:19.467 --> 00:25.650
Judy Cameron, a researcher at Oregon Health and Science University, studies brain development.

00:26.100 --> 00:30.717
According to her research, it seems that exercise can make blood vessels,...

00:31.067 --> 00:34.783
...including those in the brain, stronger and more fully developed.

00:35.567 --> 00:39.650
Cameron claims this allows people who exercise to concentrate better.

00:40.300 --> 00:44.383
She says, "While we already know that exercise is good for the heart,...

00:44.767 --> 00:48.350
...exercise can literally cause physical changes in the brain."

00:49.333 --> 00:53.850
The effects of exercise on brain development can even be seen in babies.

00:54.367 --> 00:58.517
Babies who do things that require a lot of movement and physical activity...

00:58.833 --> 01:02.650
...show greater brain development than babies who are less physically active.

01:03.400 --> 01:06.750
With babies, even a little movement can show big results.

01:07.300 --> 01:11.450
Margaret Barnes, a pediatrician, believes in the importance of exercise.

01:12.033 --> 01:16.717
She thinks that many learning disabilities children have in elementary school or high school...

01:17.067 --> 01:20.183
...can be traced back to a lack of movement as babies.

01:20.967 --> 01:24.983
"Babies need movement that stimulates their five senses", says Barnes.

01:25.567 --> 01:28.649
"They need to establish a connection between motion and memory."

01:29.233 --> 01:30.943
"In this way, as they get older,...

01:31.278 --> 01:35.117
...children will begin to associate physical activity with higher learning."

01:35.900 --> 01:38.983
The benefits of exercise on the brain are not just for babies,...

01:39.433 --> 01:42.917
...older people can beef up their brains by working out as well.

01:43.400 --> 01:49.883
Researchers at Cornell University studied a group of seniors ranging in age from seventy to seventy-nine.

01:50.667 --> 01:54.783
Their study showed a short-term memory increase of up to forty percent...

01:55.100 --> 01:57.650
...after exercising just three hours a week.

01:58.233 --> 02:00.850
The exercise does not have to be very difficult,...

02:01.233 --> 02:03.383
...but it does have to increase the heart rate.

02:04.033 --> 02:06.283
Also, just like the motion for infants,...

02:06.600 --> 02:10.100
...exercise for older people should involve some complexity.

02:10.900 --> 02:15.200
Learning some new skills or motions such as with yoga or tai-chi...

02:15.450 --> 02:20.200
...helps open up memory paths in the brain that may not have been used for a long time.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.850
For most people, any type of physical activity that increases the heart rate is helpful.

02:26.450 --> 02:29.550
The main goal is to increase the brain's flow of blood.

02:30.100 --> 02:34.650
Your brain can benefit from as little as two to three hours of exercise a week.
