Michelle, did you say something?

00:04.330 --> 00:05.450
I want my crib.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.970
Michelle, cribs are for babies.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.610
You're a big girl now.

00:11.310 --> 00:15.380
See, the trick to a new bed is you gotta break it in, you know?

00:15.480 --> 00:16.540
You gotta get the feel of it.

00:17.420 --> 00:19.250
Alright! First, let's check the shocks, okay?

00:19.750 --> 00:20.080
Here we go.

00:20.680 --> 00:21.050
Ready?

00:25.430 --> 00:27.000
That baby's got a good ride, doesn't it?

00:27.510 --> 00:31.530
Okay. And next and most importantly, you gotta find the sweet spot.

00:32.330 --> 00:37.100
Now, the sweet spot is the place that makes you feel all nice and cozy and cuddly.

00:37.770 --> 00:38.470
Get out. Let me find it.

00:41.700 --> 00:44.450
Okay. Alright. Let me see. Let me see.

00:48.020 --> 00:49.600
That's it. I found it. Okay. You ready?

00:50.080 --> 00:51.200
Come on. Let's see if you can get it.

00:51.410 --> 00:53.680
Here we go. Ready? There we go.

00:54.130 --> 00:56.520
There. You're right in the sweet spot.

00:57.410 --> 01:00.360
Ah, you're gonna sleep like a baby, I mean, like a big girl.

01:01.690 --> 01:02.760
Good night, little ankle-biter.
