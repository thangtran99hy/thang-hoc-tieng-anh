00:05.650 --> 00:06.850
Listen up, people.

00:07.100 --> 00:09.850
I am here, and I wanna help.

00:10.250 --> 00:11.700
This is our planet.

00:12.200 --> 00:13.550
Can I get a hurrah?

00:15.050 --> 00:16.250
What am I, invisible?

00:16.450 --> 00:17.550
Doesn't anybody care?

00:17.700 --> 00:19.250
Listen to me!

00:20.550 --> 00:21.600
I want one with relish.

00:21.650 --> 00:23.600
And I want mine with mustard.

00:23.950 --> 00:25.600
I want you to stop this insanity.

00:27.250 --> 00:28.450
What do you think you're doing?

00:28.500 --> 00:30.000
I'm trying to make a living here.

00:30.350 --> 00:32.450
And the planet is dying!

00:33.300 --> 00:35.800
Listen, I can't get a pulse.

00:36.150 --> 00:37.400
What are you talking about?

00:38.200 --> 00:41.950
There are 50,000 hot dog cows in Kansas alone.

00:42.150 --> 00:42.650
So?

00:43.300 --> 00:48.550
So? When those cows break wind, not only is it stinky,...

00:49.400 --> 00:51.400
...but it's cutting a hole in the ozone.

00:52.450 --> 00:56.400
Think of those hot dogs as one cubic foot of cow gas.

00:58.800 --> 00:59.600
Bon appÃ©tit.

01:01.700 --> 01:02.200
That's it.

01:02.900 --> 01:04.950
See, we can make a difference.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.500
I'll make a difference in your face if you don't get out of here.

01:07.700 --> 01:10.600
Oh, the truth hurts doesn't it, Captain Carnivore?
