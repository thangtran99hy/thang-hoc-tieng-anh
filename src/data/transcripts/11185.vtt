00:00.250 --> 00:01.000
I don't like you.

00:01.750 --> 00:02.850
I think you're a fake cop.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.550
If we were in the wild, I would attack you.

00:04.800 --> 00:08.800
If I were a lion and you were a tuna, I would swim out in the middle of the ocean and eat you!

00:10.050 --> 00:14.650
Okay. First off, a lion swimming in the ocean?

00:14.700 --> 00:15.800
Lions don't like water.

00:16.050 --> 00:19.900
If you'd placed it near a river or some sort of fresh water source, that makes sense.

00:20.050 --> 00:21.400
But you find yourself in the ocean,...

00:21.700 --> 00:24.200
...20-foot wave, I'm assuming it's off the coast of South Africa...

00:24.550 --> 00:29.500
...coming up against a full-grown, 800 - pound tuna with his 20 or 30 friends?

00:29.900 --> 00:30.800
You'll lose that battle.

00:31.100 --> 00:32.900
You'll lose that battle nine times out of ten.

00:36.450 --> 00:37.850
Did that go the way you thought it was gonna go?

00:39.650 --> 00:39.900
Nope.
