Did you see the message posted on the bulletin board, Mark?

00:05.570 --> 00:09.640
I saw something there this morning, but I didn't pay attention to it. Why?

00:10.070 --> 00:12.320
I just thought it was a strange message.

00:12.640 --> 00:16.310
For one thing, I don't think the content is relevant to our office.

00:16.650 --> 00:19.520
I was also offended by the sexist language.

00:19.950 --> 00:21.650
What was the topic of the message?

00:22.050 --> 00:26.220
The key point was criticizing the company's lack of employee accountability.

00:26.590 --> 00:30.430
But the message was several pages long. I didn't read the whole thing.

00:30.830 --> 00:35.260
Sounds like someone needs to learn how to make their messages more concise.
