Have you ever wondered where museums get the works and relics...

00:06.315 --> 00:07.565
...that they put on display?

00:08.176 --> 00:10.502
If the museum is sponsored by the government,...

00:10.920 --> 00:14.338
...then the relics were probably collected under special laws...

00:14.594 --> 00:17.825
...that protect historical treasures related to that country.

00:18.436 --> 00:21.915
However, not all museums are sponsored by the government.

00:22.528 --> 00:26.194
Sometimes a private collector decides to set up a museum,...

00:26.534 --> 00:31.035
...so that the public can view the works or relics in his or her collection.

00:31.599 --> 00:36.937
Since the 1990s, more and more of these museums set up by private collectors...

00:37.133 --> 00:38.631
...have sprung up in China.

00:39.363 --> 00:42.162
Typically, these private museums are small,...

00:42.431 --> 00:45.549
...but they give visitors the chance to see works and relics...

00:45.641 --> 00:47.387
...not found anywhere else.

00:47.861 --> 00:50.287
Songtang Li is one such collector...

00:50.583 --> 00:54.310
...who has put part of his private collection on display for the public.

00:54.764 --> 01:00.535
In 2001, Li opened his museum in an old 18th century house in Beijing.

01:01.203 --> 01:05.177
The museum displays some of the best examples of Chinese folk art...

01:05.370 --> 01:07.239
...he has collected over his lifetime.

01:07.983 --> 01:09.853
Many of the pieces in the collection...

01:10.116 --> 01:14.215
...are actually architectural decorations from old houses and buildings...

01:14.437 --> 01:15.935
...around China's capital.

01:16.558 --> 01:18.861
Whenever an old building was being torn down,...

01:19.153 --> 01:20.478
...Li would visit the site...

01:20.605 --> 01:23.590
...to see if there was anything from the building worth rescuing.

01:24.057 --> 01:28.589
In this way, Li managed to accumulate thousands of folk art pieces,...

01:28.913 --> 01:31.341
...some of which are over 1,000 years old.

01:31.944 --> 01:35.238
Li began collecting folk art sculptures when he was young.

01:35.731 --> 01:37.585
The first pieces in his collection...

01:37.774 --> 01:41.068
...were two gate piers that stood in front of his house.

01:41.390 --> 01:44.498
The stone piers were carved with historical designs...

01:44.881 --> 01:47.494
...and Li thought of them as his two friends.

01:47.959 --> 01:49.219
During his childhood,...

01:49.434 --> 01:53.223
...he would sometimes even sit beside them and tell them stories.

01:53.887 --> 01:58.295
When Li was seven, the city told Li's family to get rid of the piers...

01:58.555 --> 02:00.487
...so that the street could be rebuilt.

02:00.915 --> 02:02.722
Rather than throwing them away,...

02:02.941 --> 02:05.239
...Li's father allowed his son to keep them.

02:05.824 --> 02:09.770
Thus began Li's lifetime hobby of visiting demolition sites...

02:09.911 --> 02:13.391
...and collecting pieces of sculpture or decorative architecture.

02:13.953 --> 02:17.985
Anything that he was allowed to take away would end up in his collection.

02:18.655 --> 02:23.249
In the late 1970s, China underwent major economic reforms.

02:23.729 --> 02:24.575
At that time,...

02:24.758 --> 02:29.414
...Beijing started widespread demolition and rebuilding across the city.

02:29.857 --> 02:30.937
According to Li,...

02:31.171 --> 02:35.083
...more than ninety percent of the old houses and temples in Beijing...

02:35.395 --> 02:39.060
...have since been torn down and replaced with modern buildings.

02:39.539 --> 02:44.815
Luckily, all of old Beijing's architectural folk art has not been lost.

02:45.349 --> 02:48.813
Visitors to the Songtangzhai Folk Sculpture Museum...

02:48.899 --> 02:52.130
...can view some of the best relics Li rescued over the years.
