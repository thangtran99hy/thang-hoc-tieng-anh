00:02.250 --> 00:04.950
Imagine the busy streets of New York City,...

00:05.200 --> 00:07.500
...an enormous place with millions of people.

00:08.150 --> 00:12.800
Every day, the streets are congested with people going about their daily lives.

00:13.400 --> 00:18.550
Now, imagine a small robot in the middle of all of those people rolling down a busy sidewalk.

00:19.300 --> 00:24.300
Most people would not even notice the ten-inch smiling robot called a Tweenbot,...

00:24.450 --> 00:25.600
...rolling along the street.

00:26.350 --> 00:29.250
This strange machine may interest some people...

00:29.500 --> 00:31.450
...while others would ignore it completely.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.100
A researcher interested in studying how helpful people really are...

00:36.350 --> 00:40.950
...uses such robots in her experiments that take place on the streets of New York.

00:41.500 --> 00:45.800
The Tweenbots experiment is the idea and creation of Kacie Kinzer.

00:46.300 --> 00:51.450
Kinzer's idea was to make a robot that could navigate the city and reach its destination...

00:51.750 --> 00:54.200
...only if it was aided by pedestrians.

00:54.700 --> 00:58.350
Tweenbots rely on the kindness of warmhearted strangers.

00:58.850 --> 01:02.600
Made simply of cardboard, wheels, and a device to turn the wheels,...

01:02.900 --> 01:05.900
...the Tweenbots face many dangers on the city streets.

01:06.500 --> 01:10.350
They could be run over by cars or smashed by careless kids.

01:10.850 --> 01:15.750
Kinzer thought her little robots might even be seen as some kind of terrorist device.

01:16.450 --> 01:20.700
The only real protection a Tweenbot has is its friendly smile.

01:21.500 --> 01:25.750
In addition to that, each of Kinzer's robots is fitted with a flag...

01:26.000 --> 01:29.300
...that displays instructions for the robot's destination.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.100
The only way these robots will reach their final point is if someone lends them a hand.

01:35.750 --> 01:42.350
Tweenbots are essentially a social experiment aimed at providing people a chance to show how caring they are.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.800
On a daily basis, people in New York City are often in a hurry to get around.

01:48.250 --> 01:52.400
However, the Tweenbots, through their inability to look after themselves,...

01:52.700 --> 01:54.850
...took people out of their normal routines.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.800
The people who noticed the helpless little robots...

01:58.050 --> 02:01.800
...were actually interested in helping the Tweenbots find their way home.

02:02.400 --> 02:07.100
Tweenbots move at a constant speed and can only go in a straight line.

02:07.650 --> 02:11.150
If one was to get stuck or was going in the wrong direction,...

02:11.400 --> 02:15.200
...it would be up to strangers to free it or turn it in the right direction.

02:15.950 --> 02:19.350
Surprisingly, no Tweenbot was lost or damaged...

02:19.600 --> 02:23.000
...and each one arrived at its target in good condition.

02:23.500 --> 02:26.900
In fact, most people treated the robot in a gentle manner...

02:27.150 --> 02:30.700
...and some even treated it as though it were a small living being.

02:31.500 --> 02:33.800
Even if you were in a rush to go somewhere,...

02:34.100 --> 02:38.300
...would you stop and help a Tweenbot successfully reach its destination?
