00:02.500 --> 00:06.000
Sometimes, the road to the future leads through the past.

00:06.450 --> 00:09.950
Such was the case for Americans Scott and Brennan Olson,...

00:10.250 --> 00:15.700
...who used an old idea to launch a hot new trend in sports, in-line roller skating.

00:16.300 --> 00:20.950
In 1979, these siblings found a pair of antique roller skates...

00:21.200 --> 00:24.300
...while checking out bargains at a used sporting goods store.

00:25.050 --> 00:28.150
The skates they found had four wheels in a single row...

00:28.500 --> 00:32.500
...instead of the traditional parallel pairs of wheels in front and back.

00:33.100 --> 00:36.500
This single row of wheels intrigued the Olsons.

00:36.967 --> 00:38.597
They were avid hockey players...

00:38.763 --> 00:42.529
...and they immediately noticed the similarity between the in-line wheels,...

00:42.700 --> 00:46.000
...and the long, single blade found on the bottom of ice skates.

00:46.550 --> 00:51.200
Could these unusual skates somehow be used to practice hockey off the ice?

00:51.900 --> 00:56.800
The Olsons set about trying to modify the design of the antique skates that they had found.

00:57.500 --> 01:01.850
First, they tested out the antique skates to see how well they worked.

01:02.350 --> 01:06.650
From those tests, they tried to come up with ways to improve the old design.

01:07.350 --> 01:13.200
One improvement involved using special materials to make the skates stronger and easier to steer.

01:13.750 --> 01:17.550
The Olsons also added reliable brakes to their in-line skates.

01:18.064 --> 01:22.031
In 1980, the Olsons founded a company called "Rollerblade"...

01:22.282 --> 01:24.732
...to make and sell their new invention.

01:25.150 --> 01:30.350
Sales skyrocketed and soon, millions of people worldwide were rollerblading,...

01:30.700 --> 01:33.350
...as in-line skating was mistakenly called.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.850
At first, in-line skating was recreational.

01:37.457 --> 01:40.393
People enjoyed skating in parks and on streets,...

01:40.699 --> 01:44.343
...and some even danced on skates at giant roller discos.

01:44.900 --> 01:49.100
Today, inline group skates are popular all over the world.

01:49.800 --> 01:53.400
In cities such as San Francisco, Paris, and Berlin...

01:53.600 --> 01:59.400
...as many as 20,000 skaters might meet on a free day and skate together through the streets.

01:59.900 --> 02:04.700
Many people see in-line skating as a great way to exercise and socialize.

02:05.450 --> 02:10.850
By the mid-1990s, in-line skating had become more than just a recreational sport.

02:11.350 --> 02:14.100
It had developed into several competitive sports.

02:14.650 --> 02:18.750
One of the most popular, even today, is aggressive skating.

02:19.350 --> 02:25.350
This involves performing tricks and jumping over objects such as boxes, ramps, and rails.

02:25.788 --> 02:29.234
Other kinds of competitive skating include speed skating,...

02:29.557 --> 02:33.936
...artistic skating, downhill racing, and skating marathons.

02:34.450 --> 02:36.300
So, what about hockey?

02:36.900 --> 02:39.200
Well, the Olsons achieved their goal.

02:39.700 --> 02:42.550
Inline hockey leagues sprang up almost immediately.

02:43.050 --> 02:48.500
Then in 1999, inline hockey joined the lineup at the Pan-American Games.

02:49.050 --> 02:54.800
There are rumors that in-line skating may even become part of the Summer Olympics someday.
