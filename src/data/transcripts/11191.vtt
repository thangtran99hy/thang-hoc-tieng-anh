This incident has really started me thinking.

00:05.630 --> 00:07.300
You mean the message on the bulletin board?

00:07.500 --> 00:10.170
Yeah. I want to write a response to it,...

00:10.380 --> 00:12.640
...but I'm still trying to sort out my thoughts.

00:13.010 --> 00:16.780
If you're free for lunch, maybe you can help me brainstorm ideas.

00:17.220 --> 00:20.720
I could list a few problems with employee accountability for you right now.

00:21.190 --> 00:25.720
Save them for lunch. Once we get them on paper we can prioritize them...

00:25.860 --> 00:29.490
...and then try to come up with practical ways to deal with each one.

00:29.960 --> 00:34.730
If the ideas we come up with are good, Bob may want us to do a formal report.
