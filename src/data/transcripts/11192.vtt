Hello! Welcome to Michael's Business Top Tips.

00:03.850 --> 00:09.400
This time, we're looking at a very exciting business strategy: Blue Ocean Strategy.

00:10.000 --> 00:10.600
What is it?

00:11.450 --> 00:17.050
Well, this strategy argues that most companies are fighting in Red Oceans,...

00:17.400 --> 00:19.800
...where they're competing for market share.

00:20.950 --> 00:26.200
Now, the Red Ocean refers to the bloodshed during this fierce competition.

00:28.100 --> 00:31.950
Blue Ocean is where you create a whole new market,...

00:32.350 --> 00:34.600
...where in the beginning, there are no competitors.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.200
This is a whole new way of thinking about business strategy.

00:38.950 --> 00:44.350
While they're focusing on market share, where often you're competing on price or volume,...

00:44.750 --> 00:47.580
...here, you have no competition to worry about.

00:48.950 --> 00:51.500
Let's look at an example, Starbucks.

00:52.300 --> 00:57.700
Before Starbucks, coffee shops mainly competed on who could offer the cheaper coffee...

00:57.950 --> 00:59.300
...or the better quality coffee.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.300
However, Starbucks changed the coffee industry business...

01:03.700 --> 01:07.450
...by combining the comfortable atmosphere of a hotel lobby,...

01:07.850 --> 01:14.600
...big sofas, and relaxed style with still cheaper prices coffee, and best quality.

01:15.500 --> 01:21.600
By combining these factors, they've made a whole new kind of coffee shop experience.

01:22.100 --> 01:24.600
And at the beginning, they have no competitors.

01:26.700 --> 01:28.700
Apply this to your business.

01:29.150 --> 01:32.700
Think what you and your competitors are doing the same way.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.200
Don't just compete against them,...

01:35.400 --> 01:38.850
...think of a whole new way of approaching your business.

01:39.550 --> 01:43.250
