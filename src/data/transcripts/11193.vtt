00:02.300 --> 00:05.950
Robots are useful for exploring and working in space.

00:06.250 --> 00:09.800
In particular, many robots have been sent to explore Mars.

00:10.250 --> 00:13.700
Such robots have usually looked like a box with wheels.

00:14.250 --> 00:15.850
Though these robots are useful,...

00:16.100 --> 00:21.700
...by their very nature they are unreliable, extremely expensive, and they break easily.

00:22.150 --> 00:24.850
Also, they cannot do very many tasks.

00:25.350 --> 00:31.300
Because of these problems, scientists have been developing a new and unusual kind of robot.

00:31.900 --> 00:37.150
These new robots move like snakes, so they have been given the name "snakebots."

00:37.650 --> 00:43.500
The way a snake is shaped lets it get into very small spaces, like cracks in rocks.

00:44.050 --> 00:50.650
It can also push its way below the ground or climb up different kinds of objects, like high rocks and trees.

00:51.250 --> 00:55.800
Such abilities account for the usefulness of a robot designed like a snake.

00:56.350 --> 00:59.200
A snakebot would be able to do these things, too,...

00:59.500 --> 01:03.150
...making it much more effective than regular robots with wheels,...

01:03.400 --> 01:05.750
...which easily get stuck or fall over.

01:06.450 --> 01:11.500
Since they can carry tools, snakebots would be able to work in space, as well.

01:12.050 --> 01:15.800
They could, for example, help repair the International Space Station.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.650
But how can such a robot shape be made?

01:19.250 --> 01:24.400
A snakebot is built like a chain made of about thirty parts, or modules.

01:24.950 --> 01:30.600
Each module is basically the same in that they all have a small computer and a wheel to aid movement.

01:31.350 --> 01:36.900
The large computer in the "head" of the snake makes all of the modules in a snakebot work together.

01:37.650 --> 01:41.150
The modular design of the snakebot has many advantages.

01:41.550 --> 01:44.700
If one module fails, another can be added easily.

01:45.350 --> 01:50.250
Snakebot modules can also carry different kinds of tools, as well as cameras.

01:50.750 --> 01:53.650
Since each module is actually a robot in itself,...

01:53.900 --> 01:56.850
...one module can work apart from the rest if necessary.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.900
That is, all the modules can separate and move on their own,...

02:01.150 --> 02:04.200
...and then later, reconnect back into a larger robot.

02:04.850 --> 02:09.600
Researchers are also trying to develop snakebots made of a special kind of plastic...

02:09.900 --> 02:14.100
...that can change its shape using electricity, almost like animal muscles.

02:14.550 --> 02:18.750
Snakebots made with this plastic will be very strong and hard to break.

02:19.300 --> 02:23.950
Overall, the snakebot design is much simpler than that of common robots.

02:24.400 --> 02:27.600
Thus, snakebots will be much less expensive to build.

02:28.100 --> 02:33.400
For example, a robot recently sent to Mars cost over a hundred million dollars,...

02:33.750 --> 02:37.500
...whereas snakebots can cost as little as a few hundred dollars.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.200
With their versatility and affordability,...

02:40.400 --> 02:46.200
...snakebots seem to be the wave of the future, at least as far as space robots are concerned.
