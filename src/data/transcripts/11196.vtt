00:01.200 --> 00:03.150
Welcome to AERA English's Native Maestro.

00:03.450 --> 00:04.750
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:05.100 --> 00:08.700
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.300
Okay, today's Maestro Hook.

00:11.850 --> 00:15.150
A Hook is a good conversation piece you use when you have a conversation with somebody.

00:15.600 --> 00:16.800
And today's topic is,...

00:17.200 --> 00:21.800
...a lot of Western people say, "Yeah, Japanese people don't really say their opinion."

00:22.400 --> 00:27.050
So, for example, when someone asks you, "What do you think about that guy?"

00:27.500 --> 00:29.300
Japanese people say, "Oh! He's fine."

00:30.100 --> 00:31.350
But is he really fine?

00:31.950 --> 00:35.550
Or in a business situation, somebody says, "What do you think about that proposal?"

00:35.800 --> 00:37.650
Japanese people say, "Oh! It's not bad."

00:38.300 --> 00:39.700
But is it really not bad?

00:40.450 --> 00:43.100
You see, when Westerners ask you your opinion,...

00:43.650 --> 00:45.700
...they wanna know what you're really thinking.

00:46.300 --> 00:50.950
And it's time for you to say what you're really thinking and express your opinion.

00:51.900 --> 00:56.000
It's not a time for you to hold back and just make sure that the environment doesn't change.

00:56.250 --> 00:58.000
It's good for you to say what you're really thinking.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.700
So, next time when someone asks your opinion,...

01:00.900 --> 01:04.300
...be straightforward and say what you're really thinking, okay?

01:05.250 --> 01:07.500
Alright. So, today's Maestro Menu.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.050
"I don't care". "I don't mind".

01:20.450 --> 01:22.200
Do you know the difference between these?

01:29.950 --> 01:30.900
I don't care.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.550
What do you think about him?

01:39.900 --> 01:40.550
I don't care.

01:47.800 --> 01:48.950
Fine! I don't care.

01:58.700 --> 01:59.600
I don't mind.

02:00.200 --> 02:00.800
I don't mind.

02:07.350 --> 02:08.400
Is it hot in here?

02:08.600 --> 02:10.200
Oh, no! I don't mind.

02:11.600 --> 02:12.400
Is it hot in here?

02:12.950 --> 02:13.450
I don't care.

02:16.650 --> 02:17.200
I don't mind.

02:24.950 --> 02:27.400
Okay. For example, Maestro Lines.

02:31.500 --> 02:32.550
What do you think about that guy?

02:33.350 --> 02:34.100
I don't care.

02:39.150 --> 02:40.750
Do you think that business proposal was good?

02:40.850 --> 02:41.900
Nah, I don't really care.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.950
And also, is it really hot in here?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.200
No, no. I don't mind.

02:51.100 --> 02:53.400
Do you wanna stay in tonight or do you wanna go eat out?

02:53.600 --> 02:54.800
Oh! I don't mind.

03:00.700 --> 03:05.750
So, I don't mind if you guys have a good time or not,...

03:06.250 --> 03:08.150
...I don't care, it doesn't matter.

03:09.150 --> 03:10.550
Make sure you don't get confused.

03:11.550 --> 03:14.250
Alright. That's it for today and thanks for watching,...

03:14.300 --> 03:17.100
...and hope to catch you again next week on the Native Maestro,...

03:17.450 --> 03:19.150
...and to help you become the native maestro.

03:19.350 --> 03:21.200
Alright. See you later. Bye-bye!
