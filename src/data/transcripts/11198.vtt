00:00.011 --> 00:04.050
So Lady Gaga, you are incredible.

00:04.150 --> 00:05.900
You've become an icon.

00:06.200 --> 00:08.000
No, I haven't. No.

00:08.200 --> 00:10.600
Alright. You won't admit it, but I'm gonna say it to you.

00:12.300 --> 00:13.950
You are a fashion icon.

00:14.050 --> 00:17.150
I'm impressed. I am loving your music.

00:17.700 --> 00:19.950
What is your inspiration for your music?

00:20.200 --> 00:26.100
I'm really, really inspired by my friends in New York City,...

00:26.500 --> 00:33.450
...the art scene on the Lower East Side, and the 70s, and David Bowie, and Studio 54,...

00:33.550 --> 00:39.105
...and media culture, and obsession with fame.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.100
I totally see that.

00:42.250 --> 00:46.000
How amazing! Obsession with fame when I'm standing here with Mrs. Fame.

00:46.100 --> 00:50.350
And I read a recent interview where you said that you liked me and my sister.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.050
I do. Well, you guys went to my school.

00:52.200 --> 00:53.650
I'm really very excited that you're here.

00:53.700 --> 00:57.050
It's so funny 'cause I get asked about you on almost every interview...

00:57.450 --> 00:59.100
...and then like, "Did you know? Are we best friends?"...

00:59.150 --> 01:00.650
...and I said, "No, but I'm sure I'll meet her."

01:00.950 --> 01:04.500
And I always thought that "Stars are Blind" was one of the greatest records ever, you know.

01:04.950 --> 01:07.100
Quite honestly, it's a great pop record.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.300
Oh my God! Thank you.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.800
I'd love to do a song with you.

01:11.650 --> 01:13.350
I love her!

01:13.700 --> 01:16.700
But it's gonna take a lot more than one damn single to make me an icon.

01:16.900 --> 01:20.050
Honey, please. You're taking it over.

01:20.500 --> 01:23.200
I had the most impressive go-go dancer on the planet.

01:24.050 --> 01:24.850
I was her backup.

01:24.900 --> 01:26.500
I should have paid you.

01:27.350 --> 01:30.350
No, you were front and center spotlight go-go.

01:30.400 --> 01:31.750
No, I was the backup dancer.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.100
It was like the old days.

01:34.150 --> 01:37.200
Anything we do would be a surprise, so you guys can't know anything.

01:37.700 --> 01:38.250
Bye-bye!

01:38.600 --> 01:41.200
It's a secret. Bye guys!
