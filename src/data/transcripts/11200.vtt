I think one of the best ways to get the attention of your boss is to become undeniably innovative.

00:04.870 --> 00:09.370
To become the go-to person in the office that people look for, for the next idea or inspiration.

00:09.740 --> 00:10.970
An easy way to become that person...

00:11.220 --> 00:16.080
...is to simply include idea generation and innovation in your daily, weekly, and annual plan.

00:16.380 --> 00:20.980
If you commit to increasing your innovation skills and making idea generation part of your job,...

00:21.250 --> 00:23.380
...you will get noticed by the people that you work with.

00:23.855 --> 00:28.520
Another great way to become an innovation superstar is to aggressively support the people around you...

00:28.720 --> 00:32.630
...and practice behaviors that allow those that you lead to become their best selves.

00:33.300 --> 00:37.970
One of the fundamental rules of improvisation is to make everyone else on stage look better than yourself,...

00:38.170 --> 00:40.340
...to serve the group first and yourself second.

00:40.810 --> 00:43.300
This practice of selfless service is contagious...

00:43.540 --> 00:46.450
...and it will immediately enhance the innovative culture in which you work.

00:46.810 --> 00:51.310
And in the long run, it will always serve you as much as the people that you serve.
