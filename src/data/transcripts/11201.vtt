The city of Tokyo, Japan is divided up into special areas.

00:07.346 --> 00:12.385
Many people are familiar with famous wards such as Shibuya and Shinjuku.

00:12.922 --> 00:16.363
However, those are just two out of 23 wards...

00:16.447 --> 00:18.409
...that make up the whole city of Tokyo.

00:19.049 --> 00:23.181
One ward on the west side of Tokyo is named Suginami City.

00:23.731 --> 00:27.743
Visitors to Japan probably would not put Suginami very high...

00:27.996 --> 00:29.814
...on their list of places to see.

00:30.433 --> 00:32.537
This is mostly a residential area,...

00:32.905 --> 00:36.010
...although there are some nice clothing and antique stores there.

00:36.705 --> 00:39.648
Suginami boasts more than 300 city parks,...

00:39.990 --> 00:42.315
...in addition to three metropolitan parks...

00:42.748 --> 00:47.305
...and even the name of the city comes from the Japanese word for cedar tree.

00:47.953 --> 00:53.031
Certainly, the city is a pleasant place to live for its half a million residents.

00:53.595 --> 00:58.251
However, in 2002, Suginami City had a big problem.

00:58.645 --> 01:02.681
Thieves were breaking into houses all over the city and stealing things!

01:03.267 --> 01:10.369
In fact, in that year alone, more than 1,700 houses were broken into across Suginami.

01:10.873 --> 01:14.167
That is a huge number of break-ins for a city of this size.

01:14.703 --> 01:18.771
The police and officials in Suginami knew that something had to be done...

01:18.946 --> 01:21.157
...to curb all of the crime in their area.

01:21.921 --> 01:27.443
Finally, they came up with the idea of using flowers to curb crime in Suginami.

01:28.117 --> 01:31.163
City officials encouraged residents across the city...

01:31.425 --> 01:34.967
...to plant flowers around their houses and along streets,...

01:35.418 --> 01:38.487
...especially in places where thefts frequently occurred.

01:38.916 --> 01:42.740
The idea was that if people were outdoors taking care of the flowers,...

01:43.127 --> 01:46.204
...they would be watching people come and go at the same time.

01:46.682 --> 01:48.655
Thieves would be less likely to strike...

01:48.858 --> 01:52.338
...in areas where people were outdoors watching things closely.

01:52.799 --> 01:57.765
Over the next few years, "Operation Flower" seemed to work surprisingly well.

01:58.368 --> 02:01.034
Just two years after residents of Suginami...

02:01.124 --> 02:04.893
...began planting flowers on streets and in front of their homes,...

02:05.316 --> 02:07.568
...crime in the city dropped eighty percent!

02:08.220 --> 02:12.814
Of course, the flowers can't take all the credit for the huge reduction in crime.

02:13.487 --> 02:16.868
The city also installed 200 security cameras...

02:16.955 --> 02:19.192
...around areas with high incidents of crime.

02:19.914 --> 02:24.973
In addition, Suginami was able to recruit more than 9,000 volunteers...

02:25.091 --> 02:27.518
...to serve as crime watchers across the city.

02:28.045 --> 02:29.990
Maybe one thing that helped them recruit...

02:30.101 --> 02:33.550
...so many volunteers in the end was "Operation Flower."

02:34.187 --> 02:38.224
Many of the volunteers probably enjoy walking around their neighborhoods,...

02:38.622 --> 02:40.801
...admiring the flowers that have been planted...

02:41.001 --> 02:43.892
...while they do their duty as crime watchers.
