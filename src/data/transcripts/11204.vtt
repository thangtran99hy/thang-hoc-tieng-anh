Certain masterpieces are recognized worldwide as outstanding achievements in human creativity and ingenuity.

00:11.200 --> 00:17.700
Three good examples of such works are the Taj Mahal, the Sistine Chapel, and the sculpture of David.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.300
All of these works are hundreds of years old.

00:20.550 --> 00:25.700
And like everything that ages, some parts of them need to be restored from time to time.

00:26.200 --> 00:31.300
However, not everyone agrees on how and when certain works should be restored.

00:32.050 --> 00:38.000
In some cases, there is a pressing need for something to be done in order to save a historical treasure.

00:38.700 --> 00:41.500
For example, through careful study of the building,...

00:41.650 --> 00:46.050
...experts found that the Taj Mahal was sliding toward the river beside it!

00:46.700 --> 00:51.700
Restoration efforts then began to repair cracks in the building and halt its slide.

00:52.250 --> 00:59.800
However, such works as the Sistine Chapel and the statue of David are not under any threat of serious damage or loss.

01:00.300 --> 01:05.500
Rather, restorations are planned to clean or touch up the works so that they look better.

01:05.950 --> 01:10.250
David is a perfect case in point of just such a touch-up project.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.350
For the statue's 500th birthday,...

01:13.900 --> 01:19.200
...the museum in Italy where David stands today, planned to restore the statue's appearance.

01:19.700 --> 01:22.000
In reality, David was just dirty.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.500
That should not have surprised anyone.

01:24.850 --> 01:29.850
For more than 300 years, the statue stood outdoors in a square in Florence.

01:30.400 --> 01:31.900
When he carved the sculpture,...

01:32.100 --> 01:37.500
...Michelangelo planned for it to stand outside and naturally accumulate the marks of weathering.

01:37.950 --> 01:42.350
Therefore, critics of David's restoration claimed that cleaning the statue...

01:42.550 --> 01:45.350
...would alter its intended appearance by the artist.

01:46.100 --> 01:50.800
Ignoring these cries of protest, the museum went ahead with the restoration.

01:51.300 --> 01:56.350
After nine months of careful cleaning, the restored David was revealed to the public.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.700
So, how was the statue different?

01:59.200 --> 02:02.800
For one thing, David's hair was no longer blackened with grime.

02:03.350 --> 02:05.600
Also, the stains on his hands were gone...

02:05.900 --> 02:09.050
...and the dirty streaks on his left shin had been erased.

02:09.450 --> 02:11.150
As one art expert remarked,...

02:11.500 --> 02:16.750
..."Only someone with expert knowledge and long familiarity with the 'skin' of the statue...

02:17.000 --> 02:21.200
...will be aware that certain unattractive irregularities are no longer there."

02:21.900 --> 02:26.500
Even critics of the project agreed that the touch-ups to David were very moderate.

02:27.150 --> 02:30.500
On the other hand, the restoration of the Sistine Chapel...

02:30.750 --> 02:33.650
...resulted in a dramatic difference in the work's appearance.

02:34.150 --> 02:35.700
Through painstaking efforts,...

02:35.950 --> 02:39.300
...the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel were beautifully restored...

02:39.600 --> 02:43.800
...by erasing years of dirt and grime from the ceiling and walls.

02:44.250 --> 02:48.200
Although a few critics maintain that Michelangelo's work has been ruined,...

02:48.600 --> 02:51.750
...most view its restoration as a marvelous success.
