00:02.050 --> 00:04.250
Have you heard about the great flood?

00:04.733 --> 00:07.247
Perhaps you have heard about a man named Noah,...

00:07.561 --> 00:10.049
...who built a huge boat to escape the flood.

00:10.600 --> 00:14.350
In this legend of the great flood, water covered all the land,...

00:14.650 --> 00:17.100
...killing most of the people and animals on Earth.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.600
Only Noah's immediate family,...

00:19.900 --> 00:24.500
...including his wife, three sons, and the sons' wives, survived the flood,...

00:24.950 --> 00:27.100
...along with all of the animals on his boat.

00:27.650 --> 00:29.400
After the flood waters receded,..

00:29.750 --> 00:34.050
...the people and animals on Noah's boat set about repopulating the Earth.

00:34.750 --> 00:38.750
This legend of Noah and his family is familiar to many people.

00:39.400 --> 00:42.700
However, it is not the only legend about a great flood.

00:43.299 --> 00:47.329
Actually, many cultures have similar stories about a great flood...

00:47.549 --> 00:49.851
...that wiped out almost everyone on Earth.

00:50.200 --> 00:53.700
In the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian legends of the flood,...

00:54.100 --> 00:59.200
...Noah was warned by God that a great flood would kill every human and animal on land.

00:59.900 --> 01:05.250
God told Noah to construct a boat that would save his family and two of every animal.

01:05.950 --> 01:10.100
In a Hindu legend of the flood, a fish warned a man about the flood,...

01:10.400 --> 01:12.000
...and only the man was saved.

01:12.650 --> 01:17.350
Then the gods made a woman for the man, and the man and woman had many children.

01:18.167 --> 01:21.515
The Greek, Roman, and Chinese legends of the flood...

01:21.821 --> 01:25.300
...say that only people on the highest mountain survived the flood.

01:25.866 --> 01:28.499
In Scandinavian and Celtic legends,...

01:28.750 --> 01:31.858
...the water of the flood was actually the blood of a giant.

01:32.233 --> 01:35.125
When the giant was killed, its body became the Earth,...

01:35.473 --> 01:37.528
...and its blood covered all the land.

01:37.950 --> 01:42.600
There are also Incan, Mayan, and Native American legends about a great flood.

01:43.267 --> 01:44.711
In each of these legends,...

01:44.934 --> 01:49.930
...a few people live through the flood by climbing mountains or by constructing boats.

01:50.250 --> 01:54.050
Many people today believe that the great flood is only a legend.

01:54.600 --> 01:59.950
However, other people say that the striking similarities among all of the flood legends...

02:00.200 --> 02:04.100
...suggest that a real flood covered the Earth at some point long ago.

02:04.750 --> 02:10.650
In fact, some scientists speculate that the ancient flood waters are now frozen in glaciers...

02:10.800 --> 02:11.950
...at the poles of the Earth.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.950
But why do the legends disagree with each other?

02:15.600 --> 02:18.100
The flood happened long before humans could write,...

02:18.450 --> 02:23.800
...so the story of the flood could only be passed down through generations by oral retellings.

02:24.300 --> 02:26.600
As the story was passed by word of mouth,...

02:27.050 --> 02:30.450
...it may have changed as various cultures learned the story.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.950
This may explain why some parts of the legend differ.

02:34.700 --> 02:38.650
Through careful examination of similar elements in these legends, however,...

02:39.000 --> 02:43.550
...certain facts about an ancient catastrophic flood may be revealed.
