We're here visiting the injection-molded mansion of one of the coolest cultural icons of the past five decades.

00:10.950 --> 00:11.950
Let's see if he's home.

00:14.350 --> 00:16.700
Oh! Hi! Didn't see you there.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.050
Welcome to Ken's dream house!

00:20.000 --> 00:21.950
What's a typical day like for Ken?

00:22.200 --> 00:23.250
Oh please, listen,...

00:23.500 --> 00:24.550
...and I mean this sincerely,...

00:25.000 --> 00:26.150
...I'm just like any other toy.

00:26.450 --> 00:28.700
I still put my pants on one leg at a time.

00:29.550 --> 00:30.150
Groovy, huh?

00:30.500 --> 00:31.400
Ken has good genes,...

00:31.800 --> 00:33.450
...but happen to look great in jeans!

00:34.600 --> 00:38.500
What advice would you give a toy who's serious about becoming a Ken?

00:38.750 --> 00:41.900
Well, if you're really serious, don't be!

00:42.200 --> 00:43.100
You're a Ken doll...

00:43.300 --> 00:45.500
...and being Ken is about having fun!

00:50.450 --> 00:54.450
So, it must be difficult to be a guy who's a girl's toy?

00:55.100 --> 00:57.600
That's so... Somebody said that?

00:57.800 --> 01:01.300
Well, it's well-known that most Ken owners are girls.

01:01.950 --> 01:04.350
Okay. Look, I'm a guy's toy, okay?

01:04.700 --> 01:05.900
I'm kind of a role model.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.900
A manly role model.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.500
So, it doesn't bother you that on your own box, your name is eight times smaller than Barbie's?

01:15.450 --> 01:16.050
Next question.

01:16.450 --> 01:21.350
How do you respond to people who say you're really nothing more than a glorified Barbie accessory?

01:21.400 --> 01:22.450
Okay, that's it. Alright!

01:22.600 --> 01:23.400
This interview is over.

01:24.750 --> 01:25.950
That's totally uncool, man.
