Linda, can you take a look at this and tell me if the punctuation is correct?

00:06.300 --> 00:08.870
Sure, Mark. What do you want me to look at?

00:09.100 --> 00:12.070
I'm not sure if this sentence needs commas or not.

00:12.310 --> 00:14.080
I'm not an expert on this,...

00:14.210 --> 00:19.750
...but I usually use a comma if I would naturally break or pause when reading the sentence out loud.

00:20.180 --> 00:23.720
In this case, you have an introductory phrase in the sentence.

00:24.020 --> 00:26.100
Put a comma here after the phrase.

00:26.590 --> 00:31.130
And what about this other sentence. Should I use a colon or semicolon?

00:31.460 --> 00:35.730
Use a colon before a list, and a semicolon between sentences.

00:36.030 --> 00:37.500
You need a semicolon here.
