In the 1970s, many people became concerned about energy.

00:07.700 --> 00:11.300
People had to face up to the fact that they used too much energy...

00:11.600 --> 00:14.750
...and energy sources were not going to last forever.

00:15.350 --> 00:18.800
One architect, Michael Reynolds, decided to do something.

00:19.450 --> 00:24.500
He set out to design homes that were cheaper to build and more energy efficient.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.500
In addition, he wanted to do something about all the garbage.

00:29.100 --> 00:32.450
Finally, he came up with the idea of Earthships.

00:33.050 --> 00:36.400
Although it sounds like a boat, an Earthship is a house.

00:36.800 --> 00:41.450
However, unlike regular houses, Earthships are constructed from garbage...

00:41.700 --> 00:46.400
...and are built using only ten percent of the energy needed to build a typical house.

00:46.900 --> 00:48.700
Moreover, after they are built,...

00:49.000 --> 00:52.363
...Earthships use only ten percent of the energy required...

00:52.449 --> 00:55.262
...to heat, light, and cool a regular home.

00:55.833 --> 00:57.649
Although Earthships sound unique,...

00:57.935 --> 01:01.221
...they can actually be built to look just like any other house.

01:01.800 --> 01:06.650
One of the big benefits of Earthships is that they are made from recycled materials.

01:07.050 --> 01:12.200
The main construction material of an Earthship is used tires that are filled with dirt.

01:12.700 --> 01:16.400
The dirt-filled tires are then laid flat and stacked like bricks.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.050
Because the tires are round, there is lots of extra space between the columns of tires.

01:22.500 --> 01:25.450
These spaces are filled with used cardboard.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.800
The tires and cardboard form the outside walls of an Earthship.

01:30.500 --> 01:36.200
The inside walls between rooms in the Earthship do not need to be as strong as the outside walls.

01:36.650 --> 01:41.500
Therefore, the inside walls are made with old cans, bottles, and cement...

01:41.700 --> 01:46.150
...that are eventually covered and painted to look just like walls in a typical home.

01:46.800 --> 01:51.500
Another benefit of an Earthship is that it saves energy and natural resources.

01:51.850 --> 01:54.850
For example, an Earthship uses less water.

01:55.300 --> 01:59.750
Rain water, which is collected on the roof, is used for drinking and bathing.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.150
Furthermore, Earthships need much less energy for heating and cooling...

02:04.400 --> 02:06.400
...because they are built into the ground,...

02:06.700 --> 02:11.100
...which keeps the temperature inside the house from getting too hot or too cold.

02:11.650 --> 02:15.850
In the long run, this helps Earthship owners lower their utility bills.

02:16.350 --> 02:19.950
As well, one wall of an Earthship usually faces south.

02:20.400 --> 02:23.050
Therefore, solar heat helps to warm the house...

02:23.400 --> 02:28.750
...and solar panels built on the roof generate electricity to run appliances in the house.

02:29.300 --> 02:33.250
All of these features make Earthships very environmentally friendly.

02:33.900 --> 02:37.400
That's one of the reasons they have become popular throughout the world.

02:38.001 --> 02:42.364
Earthships have been built in Bolivia, Australia, Mexico, Japan,...

02:42.458 --> 02:46.099
...Canada, England, Scotland, and all over the US.

02:46.550 --> 02:50.000
Maybe in the near future, an Earthship will be landing near you!
