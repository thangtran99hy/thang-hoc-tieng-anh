00:00.900 --> 00:02.750
Welcome to AERA English's Native Maestro.

00:02.900 --> 00:04.000
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:04.150 --> 00:07.400
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:08.250 --> 00:09.550
Okay, today's Maestro Hook.

00:10.100 --> 00:12.800
A Hook is a good conversation piece you can use with somebody...

00:12.986 --> 00:14.173
...when you have nothing to talk about.

00:14.300 --> 00:16.400
And today's topic is body language.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.554
But now, when I say body language,...

00:18.694 --> 00:21.233
...we're not talking about using your body to communicate.

00:21.352 --> 00:26.133
But in English, there are a lot of phrases that you can use that use your body parts...

00:26.388 --> 00:27.766
...to talk about something specific.

00:27.850 --> 00:30.600
For example, you say something like, "He's very nosy."

00:31.000 --> 00:32.350
It's your nose. It's nosy.

00:32.850 --> 00:35.400
This means that he likes to barge in to somebody's business.

00:36.100 --> 00:39.700
Or, for example, you say, "He has a good head on his shoulders."

00:40.100 --> 00:43.000
This means that he's a very decent person or he thinks ahead.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.300
For example, "He stabbed me in the back."

00:46.400 --> 00:49.650
You stab someone in the back, this means you betray somebody.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.550
Or another one is, "You pull my leg."

00:53.050 --> 00:56.600
You pull someone's leg, this means you get in somebody's way...

00:56.700 --> 00:58.200
...and stop them from doing something.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.000
Like that, there's a lot of words you can use.

01:01.350 --> 01:04.700
And so today, I'd like to pick up some words that you can use that are very interesting.

01:05.550 --> 01:06.550
Today's Maestro Menu.

01:15.250 --> 01:16.500
You twisted my arm.

01:17.150 --> 01:18.250
You twisted my arm.

01:19.300 --> 01:19.900
Twist your arm.

01:21.750 --> 01:22.450
Ouch! Ouch!

01:29.850 --> 01:30.750
You twist my arm.

01:41.250 --> 01:42.100
And the next one.

01:42.950 --> 01:44.350
Get off your butt.

01:45.150 --> 01:46.100
Get off your butt.

01:52.050 --> 01:53.250
Come on, get off your butt!

02:00.000 --> 02:00.700
Get off your butt.

02:09.450 --> 02:11.450
Okay. So, Maestro Lines.

02:13.650 --> 02:15.900
Can you go to the post office for me and pick up the mail?

02:16.200 --> 02:17.250
Please, please?

02:17.750 --> 02:19.750
Oh, fine! You twisted my arm.

02:19.850 --> 02:20.600
I'll go for you.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.400
And get off your butt.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.800
Come on! It's already 11 o'clock. Get off your butt and go to work.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.500
Or, get off your butt and clean the house.

02:32.950 --> 02:34.100
Come on, get off your butt!

02:38.150 --> 02:41.450
There's a lot more English you can use with your body and all this is body language.

02:41.650 --> 02:45.950
So, find out a lot of good words and use them on really perfect situations...

02:46.050 --> 02:48.200
...and you'll be a native maestro in no time.

02:49.050 --> 02:51.500
Alright. That's it for today. Thanks for watching...

02:51.650 --> 02:54.000
...and hope to see you again on next week's Native Maestro.

02:54.500 --> 02:55.100
Bye-bye!
