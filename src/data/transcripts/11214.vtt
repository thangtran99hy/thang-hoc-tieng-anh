00:00.500 --> 00:03.370
It's my honor to be part of this great event...

00:03.970 --> 00:05.521
...and my name is Hiroshi Mikitani,...

00:05.629 --> 00:09.676
...and I'm the CEO and founder of a Japanese Internet company called "Rakuten".

00:10.750 --> 00:15.080
We started our company in 1997.

00:17.720 --> 00:20.650
We started from scratch with my younger partner...

00:21.220 --> 00:24.390
...who was a graduate school student at that time.

00:25.120 --> 00:30.990
Unlike our competitors in the United States, we started from our own capital,...

00:31.360 --> 00:33.430
...which was 200,000 dollars...

00:34.230 --> 00:37.010
...and never raised any money from VCs.

00:37.150 --> 00:40.640
I'm sure there are so many venture capital people here, sorry to tell you about that, but...

00:41.300 --> 00:42.870
...never raised any money from VC.

00:43.690 --> 00:45.340
We went public in the year 2000....

00:45.940 --> 00:49.980
...and we cultivated the first boat, the last boat of the first Internet bubble.

00:51.230 --> 00:54.790
So, we raised about 500 million dollars from our IPO,...

00:55.380 --> 01:00.610
...and since then, we have been aggressively expanding our business...

01:00.760 --> 01:02.960
...in terms of scope and in terms of scale.

01:04.220 --> 01:08.800
Now, we are by far number 1 in e-commerce, number 1 in online travel,...

01:09.080 --> 01:13.090
...number 1 in online banking, number 2 in online brokerage.

01:13.940 --> 01:20.640
So, we have about 38 Internet-related businesses and market cap of about 11 billion dollars,...

01:21.710 --> 01:25.920
...but one thing we know is we have been a very Japan-centric company.

01:26.480 --> 01:27.920
We didn't expand globally...

01:28.520 --> 01:30.750
...up to three or four years ago.

01:32.350 --> 01:35.870
Whereby our competitors like Google, Amazon, eBay...

01:36.375 --> 01:40.006
...have aggressively expanded their businesses into other countries...

01:40.330 --> 01:44.403
...so now, we have decided to grow our service band...

01:45.334 --> 01:49.958
...and I think, now, we converted the internal language...

01:50.370 --> 01:52.940
...of our company from Japanese to English,...

01:53.880 --> 01:58.010
...which I don't think there's any Japanese company who really tried to do it.

01:58.790 --> 02:02.690
And we believe our business model is very unique,...

02:03.120 --> 02:11.060
...but I think we can really execute what we have done in Japan in other countries.

02:11.460 --> 02:16.030
And I'm really looking forward to sharing my experience, and I have a work session in the afternoon,...

02:16.400 --> 02:19.840
...and looking forward to, you know, exchanging any ideas. Thank you very much!
