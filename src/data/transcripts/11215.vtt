00:01.100 --> 00:02.050
And my name is Seth Priebatsch.

00:02.100 --> 00:03.350
I'm the chief ninja of SCVNGR.

00:03.600 --> 00:05.150
I am a proud Princeton dropout.

00:05.400 --> 00:08.350
Also proud to have relocated here to Boston, where I actually grew up.

00:09.800 --> 00:10.350
Yup, Boston.

00:11.000 --> 00:11.450
Easy wins.

00:11.550 --> 00:13.300
I should just go and name the counties that we've got around here.

00:13.600 --> 00:17.550
So, I'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world...

00:18.100 --> 00:20.200
...and this is sort of a new concept, and it's really important.

00:20.550 --> 00:23.400
Because while the last decade was the decade of social...

00:23.750 --> 00:27.200
...and the decade of where the framework in which we connect with other people was built,...

00:27.550 --> 00:31.450
...this next decade will be the decade where the game framework is built...

00:31.550 --> 00:34.600
...where the motivations that we use to actually influence behavior,...

00:34.800 --> 00:36.550
...and the framework in which that is constructed...

00:37.050 --> 00:38.800
...is decided upon, and that's really important.
