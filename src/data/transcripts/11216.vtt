There are folks in Washington right now who think we should abandon our efforts to support clean energy.

00:06.500 --> 00:12.850
They've made the political calculation that it's better to stand on the sidelines than work as a team...

00:13.750 --> 00:16.800
...to help American businesses and American workers.

00:17.750 --> 00:20.550
So, they said "no" to the small business tax cuts I talked about.

00:20.700 --> 00:22.550
They said "no" to rebuilding infrastructure.

00:22.950 --> 00:25.000
And they said "no" to clean energy projects.

00:26.150 --> 00:30.100
They even voted against getting rid of tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas,...

00:30.150 --> 00:33.900
...so we could give those tax breaks to companies that are investing right here in Wisconsin.

00:35.500 --> 00:38.900
And my answer to people who have been playing politics the past year and a half is...

00:39.200 --> 00:40.300
...they should come to this plant.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.500
They should go to any of the dozen new battery factories...

00:45.600 --> 00:48.100
...or the new electric vehicle manufacturers,...

00:48.200 --> 00:53.700
...the new wind turbine makers, or the solar plants that are popping up all over this country.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.600
And they should have to explain why they think...

00:57.000 --> 01:01.600
...these clean energy jobs are better off being made in Germany or China, or Spain...

01:02.400 --> 01:04.950
...instead of right here in the United States.

01:07.700 --> 01:11.000
See, when folks lift up the hoods on the cars of the future,...

01:12.150 --> 01:14.800
...I want them to see engines stamped, "Made in America".

01:16.150 --> 01:19.700
When new batteries to store solar power come off the line,...

01:19.950 --> 01:23.100
...I want to see printed on the side, "Made in America".

01:24.250 --> 01:28.350
When new technologies are developed and new industries are formed,...

01:28.400 --> 01:30.500
...I want them made right here in America.

01:30.950 --> 01:32.150
That's what we're fighting for.

01:33.100 --> 01:34.200
That's what this is about.
