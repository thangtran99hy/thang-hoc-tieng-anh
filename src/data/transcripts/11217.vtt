Nice Talking with You: Travel.

00:02.570 --> 00:07.300
We asked the students of Global Voices, "Where's a great place for everyone to visit...

00:07.610 --> 00:09.440
...and why should they go there?"...

00:09.540 --> 00:11.040
...and here's what they had to say.

00:11.870 --> 00:14.710

00:19.010 --> 00:21.220
My favorite city in America...

00:22.080 --> 00:26.160
...is San Francisco. It's a city where something is always happening.

00:26.990 --> 00:33.500
The first time I went to San Francisco, it was the weekend where it was the Chinese New Year...

00:33.900 --> 00:39.570
...and also, they were having a peace protest at the bay areas, Fisherman's Wharf.

00:40.040 --> 00:45.740
There were angry protesters, then we saw all these celebrities,...

00:46.240 --> 00:51.180
...and then that night was the Chinese New Year, and the streets were filled with dragons.

00:51.680 --> 00:52.350
It was fun!

00:53.350 --> 00:54.180
Tahiti.

00:54.580 --> 00:56.220
There are lots of islands in Tahiti.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.850
It was just an incredible, cultural mix.

00:59.050 --> 01:03.890
They have like the native Polynesian, the French,...

01:04.360 --> 01:08.860
...and the food was great, but what I loved the most was the scenery.

01:09.040 --> 01:12.600
This most incredible scenery I remember, sitting in a lagoon,...

01:13.040 --> 01:15.800
...the white sands and the crystal blue ocean,...

01:16.040 --> 01:20.740
...sitting in the sea and just sitting there doing nothing. I wasn't swimming or anything...

01:21.040 --> 01:24.580
...and I thought at that moment that this was heaven on Earth.
