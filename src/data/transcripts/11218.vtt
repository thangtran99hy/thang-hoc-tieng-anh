Would you believe that your diet can make a big difference...

00:06.153 --> 00:07.822
...in keeping a youthful appearance?

00:08.299 --> 00:13.045
It seems strange to think that the food we take in could result in fewer wrinkles.

00:13.679 --> 00:17.803
Wouldn't it be better to put things on our skin rather than in our mouths?

00:18.425 --> 00:24.082
Well, according to one scientific theory, our bodies start aging because of oxidation.

00:24.724 --> 00:27.981
This is caused by certain oxygen-containing molecules...

00:28.063 --> 00:30.733
...in our cells called free radicals.

00:31.299 --> 00:34.097
Free radicals have the capability to attach to...

00:34.329 --> 00:37.862
...and damage parts of our cells including our DNA.

00:38.455 --> 00:41.037
Our bodies have the ability to repair this damage.

00:41.493 --> 00:46.056
However, as we get older, these repair mechanisms start to break down...

00:46.337 --> 00:49.259
...resulting in signs of aging such as wrinkles.

00:49.870 --> 00:52.545
Free radicals are actually produced by our bodies,...

00:52.896 --> 00:56.532
...but their numbers can also increase because of the food we eat.

00:56.984 --> 01:01.207
Besides avoiding foods that could potentially produce more free radicals,...

01:01.615 --> 01:05.219
...eating foods that contain certain vitamins and micronutrients...

01:05.471 --> 01:07.508
...can also keep us looking young.

01:08.105 --> 01:11.893
These vitamins help produce molecules called antioxidants,...

01:12.198 --> 01:15.275
...which actually help reduce the production of free radicals.

01:15.747 --> 01:19.195
Even better, foods containing antioxidants are not rare.

01:19.833 --> 01:23.009
Common antioxidants, like vitamins A and E,...

01:23.303 --> 01:25.759
...can be found in many dark-colored vegetables.

01:26.181 --> 01:29.905
For example, carrots, seaweed, spinach, and broccoli...

01:30.215 --> 01:33.261
...are all excellent sources of these helpful vitamins.

01:33.834 --> 01:38.243
Also, you can eat orange-colored fruits like apricots and peaches.

01:38.849 --> 01:43.939
Vitamins A and E are particularly good for helping your skin remain young - looking.

01:44.395 --> 01:47.679
These nutrients strengthen your skin and make it soft.

01:48.224 --> 01:51.691
However, if you really want to stock up quickly on nutrients...

01:51.776 --> 01:53.026
...that benefit your skin,...

01:53.255 --> 01:54.658
...you should eat cow's liver.

01:55.277 --> 01:57.518
One small piece of cooked cow's liver...

01:57.690 --> 02:01.851
...contains twice as much vitamin A as half a cup of cooked carrots.

02:02.511 --> 02:06.716
More recently, green tea has also been tentatively added...

02:06.798 --> 02:09.216
...to the list of youth-promoting substances.

02:09.729 --> 02:14.633
Research on green tea's effects on our bodies is still in the early stages.

02:14.928 --> 02:17.664
Scientists certainly believe that it is good for us,...

02:17.923 --> 02:22.021
...but they are cautious about predicting its ability to keep us looking youthful.

02:22.397 --> 02:28.044
However, recent experiments seem to show that green tea's antioxidant properties...

02:28.388 --> 02:30.992
...can repair cell damage already sustained...

02:31.355 --> 02:33.462
...as well as prevent damage in the future.

02:33.901 --> 02:38.225
In fact, green tea works even better if you apply it directly to your skin...

02:38.329 --> 02:40.199
...as an ingredient in facial cream.

02:40.837 --> 02:42.179
"You are what you eat."

02:42.667 --> 02:45.031
The more we find out about how our bodies work,...

02:45.379 --> 02:47.929
...the more this old proverb seems to be true.

02:48.564 --> 02:51.672
Think about that the next time you sit down at the table.
