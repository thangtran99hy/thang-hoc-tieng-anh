Hello?

00:09.500 --> 00:10.050
It's Jack.

00:14.700 --> 00:15.250
I want out.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.600
Consider it your last job.

00:19.250 --> 00:20.550
You don't even have to pull the trigger.

00:22.250 --> 00:23.000
You're an American.

00:23.250 --> 00:24.950
I'll say, a working vacation.

00:28.500 --> 00:30.500
You have the hands of a craftsman.

00:32.350 --> 00:33.600
You are good with machines.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.050
I do what I'm good at.

00:37.750 --> 00:39.850
The Belgians think someone might have put a tail on you.

00:42.150 --> 00:44.100
You've got a long list of enemies, Jack.

00:45.250 --> 00:46.850
I told them no one gets close to you.

00:47.050 --> 00:47.600
They don't.

00:48.900 --> 00:52.150
You're a good man, but you have a secret.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.400
You have done a lot of sinning.

00:56.600 --> 00:57.450
All men are sinners.

00:59.250 --> 01:00.850
Everything I've done, I've had good cause to do.

01:06.950 --> 01:08.000
I can't stay forever.

01:10.550 --> 01:11.400
Take me with you.

01:13.850 --> 01:17.950
A man can be rich if he has God in his heart.

01:19.350 --> 01:21.200
I don't think God is very interested in me, Father.
