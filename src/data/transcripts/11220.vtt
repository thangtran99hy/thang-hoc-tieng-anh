I start with something funny each week and...

00:02.160 --> 00:05.370
...I heard about this teenager, he'd just gotten his driver's permit...

00:05.470 --> 00:07.600
...and he asked his dad if he could borrow the car.

00:08.040 --> 00:09.870
The dad says, "Son, I'll make a deal with you."

00:10.170 --> 00:14.910
"If you bring your grades up, read your Bible every day, and get your haircut,...

00:15.210 --> 00:16.280
...I'll let you borrow the car."

00:16.810 --> 00:18.870
A month later, he came back and asked about the car...

00:19.010 --> 00:22.550
...and the dad said, "Son, you brought your grades up, you've been reading your Bible,...

00:22.750 --> 00:24.690
...but you still haven't gotten your haircut."

00:25.150 --> 00:27.290
The son said, "Well dad, I've been thinking about it,...

00:27.520 --> 00:32.500
...Moses had long hair, Samson had long hair, even Jesus had long hair."

00:32.930 --> 00:35.830
The dad said, "Yes, son and they walked everywhere they went."
