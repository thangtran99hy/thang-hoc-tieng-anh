It's lunch time at this soup kitchen in New York city...

00:02.600 --> 00:04.530
...and the turnover at the tables is brisk.

00:04.930 --> 00:06.670
Part of the Solution or POTS...

00:06.870 --> 00:10.010
...is widely known in the Bronx as the friendliest soup kitchen in the borough...

00:10.240 --> 00:12.310
...and there are lines at the door for hours.

00:12.540 --> 00:13.810
We get people that're working...

00:14.040 --> 00:17.710
...and they come over to eat lunch because they can't afford that $7 to $10 a day...

00:17.880 --> 00:19.420
...so they can come in and eat for nothing.

00:20.020 --> 00:20.820
And save that money.

00:21.280 --> 00:25.820
Michael Kennedy has a job at the nearby cinema and eats at POTS five times a week.

00:26.130 --> 00:28.890
He found it hard at first to swallow his pride and ask for help...

00:29.190 --> 00:31.760
...but says the soup kitchen is a powerful equalizer.

00:31.890 --> 00:34.940
I'm well beyond the point of not me, not I, you know?

00:36.030 --> 00:38.130
I'm beyond that, I'm like everybody else...

00:38.230 --> 00:42.900
...and again, it doesn't really make any difference who you are and what you once were.

00:44.790 --> 00:47.110
The reality of it is that I needed to come here...

00:47.580 --> 00:49.980
...to get help with housing, to get help with Medicaid,...

00:50.080 --> 00:51.950
...to get help with food stamps, and to get a meal.
