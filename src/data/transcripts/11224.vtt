00:02.400 --> 00:05.900
People who daydream are often thought of in negative terms...

00:06.150 --> 00:09.800
...such as being lazy or not doing what they should be doing.

00:10.300 --> 00:14.800
However, scientists who study the brain have learned many interesting things...

00:15.050 --> 00:18.200
...especially from studying the brains of daydreamers.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.200
In fact, far from being a waste of time,...

00:21.450 --> 00:27.600
...some scientists believe that daydreaming is a healthy and useful activity for all of our brains.

00:28.200 --> 00:33.450
In order to study the brain, scientists use special devices that scan the brain...

00:33.700 --> 00:37.700
...and show pictures of which parts of the brain are active at certain times.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.750
When a person is daydreaming,...

00:40.000 --> 00:45.850
...the device will show a distinct pattern of activity in the brain called the "default" mode of thinking.

00:46.450 --> 00:50.950
In the default mode, the top or outside part of the brain is very active.

00:51.400 --> 00:55.400
Actually, several regions of the brain are interacting in this mode.

00:55.850 --> 01:00.850
Some scientists describe this mode as a time when the brain focuses on itself...

01:01.200 --> 01:04.050
...rather than focusing on the environment around the person.

01:04.650 --> 01:08.350
Typically, this occurs when a person is doing simple, tedious work...

01:08.650 --> 01:12.400
...or performing routine actions that don't need much attention...

01:12.750 --> 01:15.800
...like walking to school or cooking simple foods.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.950
People tend to daydream during such activities.

01:19.350 --> 01:24.050
The importance of daydreaming lies in developing both creative and social skills.

01:24.500 --> 01:29.100
When the mind is not engaged in dealing with one's immediate situation or problem,...

01:29.400 --> 01:30.750
...then it is free to wander.

01:31.250 --> 01:34.650
A time of wandering allows the mind to create things.

01:35.200 --> 01:40.100
New inventions may be imagined or possible solutions to a problem can be planned.

01:40.650 --> 01:45.700
For example, solutions for problems in relationships with other people may come to mind.

01:46.300 --> 01:50.100
In fact, most daydreams involve situations with others.

01:50.500 --> 01:53.750
Perhaps these are daydreams based on memories of the past...

01:54.150 --> 01:56.600
...or daydreams of what might be in the future.

01:57.169 --> 02:01.913
In either case, daydreams help us develop the appropriate skills we can use...

02:01.999 --> 02:03.722
...in real interactions with others.

02:04.200 --> 02:08.700
As neurologist Dr. Marcus Raichle of Washington University explains,...

02:09.300 --> 02:13.100
..."When you don't use a muscle, that muscle really isn't doing much."

02:13.400 --> 02:17.350
"But when your brain is supposedly doing nothing and daydreaming,...

02:17.600 --> 02:19.350
...it's really doing a tremendous amount."

02:19.950 --> 02:24.150
During the so-called "resting state", the brain isn't resting at all!
