00:00.500 --> 00:02.460
I mean, you're a teacher, Taylor.

00:03.200 --> 00:05.660
Be honest. What do you make?

00:07.400 --> 00:08.900
And I wish he hadn't done that.

00:10.960 --> 00:16.130
Ask me to be honest because you see, I have a policy...

00:16.560 --> 00:19.960
...about honesty and ass kicking which is...

00:20.160 --> 00:22.860
...if you ask for it, then I have to let you have it.

00:25.860 --> 00:27.530
You wanna know what I make?

00:28.660 --> 00:32.030
I make kids work harder than they ever thought they could!

00:32.360 --> 00:36.630
I can make a C+ feel like a Congressional Medal of Honor...

00:36.900 --> 00:39.830
...and I can make an A- feel like a slap in the face.

00:39.930 --> 00:43.800
How dare you waste my time with anything less than your very best!

00:44.030 --> 00:45.800
You wanna know what I make?

00:45.960 --> 00:51.860
I make kids sit through 40 minutes of study hall in absolute silence.

00:52.060 --> 00:54.700
No, you cannot work in groups.

00:54.860 --> 00:58.060
No, you can't ask a question, so put your hand down.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.500
Why won't I let you go to the bathroom?

01:00.730 --> 01:04.330
Because you're bored, and you don't really have to go, do you?
