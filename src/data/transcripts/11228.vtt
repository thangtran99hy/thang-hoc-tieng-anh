00:16.420 --> 00:19.520
This was the start of an apocalypse that would sweep the entire world.

00:22.490 --> 00:23.820
That was 5 years ago.

00:24.350 --> 00:25.290
My name is Alice.

00:28.020 --> 00:30.590
The last survivors followed a radio signal to Alaska...

00:31.150 --> 00:33.860
This is Octavia broadcasting on the emergency frequency.

00:35.300 --> 00:38.100
We offer safety and security, food and shelter.

00:38.400 --> 00:39.570
...but I could find only one.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.200
Claire, who did this to you?

00:45.010 --> 00:45.570
Umbrella.

00:46.740 --> 00:47.580
We have to move on.

00:50.250 --> 00:53.220
Our only chance for survival is finding the source of the signal.

00:54.790 --> 00:58.850
This is Octavia. We offer safety and security, food and shelter.

01:00.490 --> 01:01.260
Luther!

01:02.320 --> 01:02.800
Come on!

01:02.990 --> 01:05.890
The man responsible for this disaster took refuge underground.

01:09.300 --> 01:11.770
The Umbrella Corporation feels safe.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.440
Everything is quiet here.

01:14.140 --> 01:15.000
They feel secure.

01:16.640 --> 01:17.270
They're wrong.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.480
Now, this is a pleasant surprise.

01:33.120 --> 01:33.590
Claire!

01:50.840 --> 01:51.740
Hey, boys!

01:52.750 --> 01:54.740
Is that any way to treat a lady?
