00:01.200 --> 00:02.100
Oh, sorry, sorry.

00:03.550 --> 00:06.900
Okay, welcome to AERA English's Native Maestro.

00:07.150 --> 00:08.250
I'm your maitre d', Seita.

00:08.650 --> 00:12.000
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:12.900 --> 00:18.250
Alright, today's topic is about how Westerners are always on the go.

00:18.350 --> 00:20.550
Westerners are busy, busy, busy doing something...

00:20.900 --> 00:21.900
...and they're always in a rush...

00:22.500 --> 00:26.200
...especially, western people are a little bit impatient and they don't like to wait for people.

00:26.650 --> 00:30.250
So, compared to how Japanese people can wait and take their time,...

00:30.500 --> 00:33.900
...maybe Westerners are a little bit more impatient and they're a little bit busier.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.850
So, western people are always rushing you.

00:37.700 --> 00:41.100
So today's Maestro Menu, I'd like to talk about some words that you can use...

00:41.550 --> 00:43.400
...when you wanna rush somebody, okay?

00:44.150 --> 00:44.500
Alright.

00:55.650 --> 00:56.000
Today.

00:59.600 --> 01:00.200
Today.

01:10.350 --> 01:11.450
Come on, today.

01:19.800 --> 01:20.550
And one more.

01:21.950 --> 01:22.600
We have time?

01:23.750 --> 01:24.900
The clock is ticking.

01:25.800 --> 01:26.600
Clock is ticking.

01:30.600 --> 01:31.300
Clock is ticking.

01:39.350 --> 01:40.000
Clock is ticking.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.850
Alright. So, Maestro Lines.

01:50.550 --> 01:52.000
You still haven't gotten ready?

01:52.350 --> 01:55.500
Come on! The movie starts at 11 o'clock today. Let's go!

01:56.750 --> 01:57.600
Today, come on!

02:00.600 --> 02:01.900
Okay, and...

02:03.600 --> 02:05.300
...the report is due at the end of the week.

02:05.600 --> 02:07.750
Come on, the clock is ticking. We gotta start working.

02:11.650 --> 02:12.950
Come on, it's next week.

02:13.050 --> 02:13.850
The clock is ticking.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.100
Alright. So, I'm on the go.

02:18.150 --> 02:22.400
Gotta go so next week, we'll be having another show so hope you enjoy it...

02:22.550 --> 02:24.800
...and please use these words to become the native maestro.

02:25.100 --> 02:26.050
Alright, see you later.

02:26.250 --> 02:27.250
Bye-bye. Got to go.

02:29.850 --> 02:30.200
