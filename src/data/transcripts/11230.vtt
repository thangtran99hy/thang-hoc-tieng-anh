00:00.200 --> 00:02.970
From this desk, seven and a half years ago,...

00:03.700 --> 00:07.170
...President Bush announced the beginning of military operations in Iraq.

00:08.270 --> 00:09.640
Much has changed since that night.

00:10.670 --> 00:14.340
A war to disarm a state became a fight against an insurgency.

00:15.510 --> 00:20.050
Terrorism and sectarian warfare threatened to tear Iraq apart.

00:21.250 --> 00:23.690
Thousands of Americans gave their lives.

00:24.560 --> 00:26.390
Tens of thousands have been wounded.

00:27.620 --> 00:29.760
Our relations abroad were strained.

00:30.690 --> 00:32.890
Our unity at home was tested.

00:34.430 --> 00:39.170
These are the rough waters encountered during the course of one of America's longest wars,...

00:40.100 --> 00:44.010
...yet there has been one constant amidst these shifting tides.

00:44.940 --> 00:51.750
At every turn, America's men and women in uniform have served with courage and resolve.

00:52.950 --> 00:56.120
As commander in chief, I am incredibly proud of their service...

00:57.220 --> 01:00.920
...and like all Americans, I'm awed by their sacrifice,...

01:01.490 --> 01:03.730
...and by the sacrifices of their families.

01:05.360 --> 01:09.230
The Americans who have served in Iraq completed every mission they were given.

01:10.100 --> 01:12.500
They defeated a regime that had terrorized its people.

01:13.670 --> 01:17.970
Together with Iraqis and coalition partners who made huge sacrifices of their own,...

01:18.570 --> 01:20.510
...our troops fought block by block...

01:20.780 --> 01:23.480
...to help Iraq seize the chance for a better future.

01:24.450 --> 01:27.120
They shifted tactics to protect the Iraqi people,...

01:27.680 --> 01:31.590
...trained Iraqi Security Forces, and took out terrorist leaders.

01:32.720 --> 01:35.390
Because of our troops and civilians,...

01:35.820 --> 01:38.060
...and because of the resilience of the Iraqi people,...

01:38.830 --> 01:43.970
Iraq has the opportunity to embrace a new destiny, even though many challenges remain.

01:45.430 --> 01:50.940
So tonight, I am announcing that the American combat mission in Iraq has ended.

01:51.940 --> 01:54.480
Operation Iraqi Freedom is over...

01:55.110 --> 02:00.320
...and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country.
