00:02.767 --> 00:05.383
Most people wish they had better memories.

00:05.733 --> 00:09.017
They also worry about forgetting things as they get older.

00:09.567 --> 00:12.817
But did you know that we have different kinds of memory?

00:13.533 --> 00:16.717
When one or more of these kinds of memories start to fail,...

00:17.033 --> 00:21.417
...there are a few simple things that everyone can do to improve their memories.

00:22.099 --> 00:27.250
What most people think of as memory is, in fact, five different categories of memory.

00:27.933 --> 00:33.117
Our capability to remember things from the past, that is, years or days ago,...

00:33.367 --> 00:35.583
...depends on two categories of memory.

00:36.100 --> 00:39.517
They are remote memory and recent memory, respectively.

00:40.100 --> 00:42.317
Think back to last year's birthday.

00:42.767 --> 00:43.650
What did you do?

00:44.233 --> 00:48.317
If you can't remember that, you are having a problem with your remote memory.

00:48.833 --> 00:52.583
On the other hand, if you can't remember what you ate for lunch yesterday,...

00:52.833 --> 00:55.050
...that is a problem with your recent memory.

00:55.833 --> 00:59.250
Remembering past events is only one way we use memories.

00:59.800 --> 01:03.650
When taking a test, we need to draw on our semantic memories.

01:04.233 --> 01:06.583
That is the sum of our acquired knowledge.

01:07.133 --> 01:10.983
Or maybe we want to remember to do or use something in the future,...

01:11.367 --> 01:13.250
...either minutes or days from now.

01:13.933 --> 01:18.183
These cases use our immediate and prospective memories, respectively.

01:18.833 --> 01:22.750
Have you ever thought to yourself, "I need to remember to turn off the light,..."

01:23.133 --> 01:24.817
...but then promptly forgot it?

01:25.467 --> 01:27.617
That would be a faulty immediate memory.

01:28.133 --> 01:32.917
On the other hand, maybe you can easily remember to meet your friend for lunch next week.

01:33.467 --> 01:37.550
That means that at least your prospective memory is in good working order.

01:38.467 --> 01:43.050
Many people think that developing a bad memory is unavoidable as we get older,...

01:43.433 --> 01:45.317
...but this is actually not the case.

01:45.867 --> 01:52.183
Of our five kinds of memory, immediate, remote, and prospective (if aided with cues like memos),...

01:52.500 --> 01:53.917
...do not degrade with age.

01:54.500 --> 01:59.383
But how can we prevent a diminishing of our semantic and unaided prospective memories?

02:00.033 --> 02:01.850
The secret seems to be activity.

02:02.433 --> 02:05.117
Studies have shown that a little mental activity,...

02:05.400 --> 02:08.717
...like learning new things or even doing crossword puzzles,...

02:09.000 --> 02:12.117
...goes a long way in positively affecting our memories.

02:12.800 --> 02:17.017
Regular physical activity appears to be able to make our memories better as well.

02:17.600 --> 02:21.583
This is possibly due to having a better blood supply to the brain.

02:22.267 --> 02:25.783
The one thing to avoid at all costs, though, is stress.

02:26.267 --> 02:30.250
When we are stressed, our bodies release a hormone called cortisol,...

02:30.567 --> 02:33.783
...which is harmful to our brain cells and thus our memories.

02:34.533 --> 02:38.790
Reducing stress through meditation, exercise, or other activities...

02:39.133 --> 02:41.783
...can help to preserve our mental abilities.
