00:02.530 --> 00:04.970
It's only thirty-six centimeters tall,...

00:05.300 --> 00:10.075
...but to fans throughout the world, it represents the highest achievement in football.

00:10.540 --> 00:11.740
Every four years,...

00:11.870 --> 00:16.780
...teams from all over the globe compete to take home the FIFA World Cup trophy,...

00:17.120 --> 00:18.680
...yet nobody ever does.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.855
Nobody ever takes it home...

00:21.120 --> 00:25.820
...because the 18-carat gold trophy is kept under lock and key by FIFA...

00:26.190 --> 00:29.160
...Federation Internationale de Football Association.

00:29.660 --> 00:33.540
The champions of each World Cup tournament receive only a replica.

00:34.030 --> 00:36.770
This is to protect the valuable prize from thieves...

00:37.040 --> 00:41.410
...who have stolen the World Cup trophy twice in its 75-year history.

00:42.140 --> 00:45.410
The little trophy has certainly had a troubled existence.

00:45.910 --> 00:49.950
The original trophy was made by a French sculptor, Abel LaFleur,...

00:50.080 --> 00:55.080
...and was called the "Jules Rimet Cup", in honor of the founder of the World Cup tournament.

00:55.580 --> 01:01.760
Sometime during the first three World Cup events (1930, 1934, and 1938),...

01:02.120 --> 01:04.890
...the name changed to simply the "World Cup".

01:05.490 --> 01:09.600
Then during World War II, not much was seen or heard of the trophy.

01:10.070 --> 01:15.040
It was being kept hidden in a shoe box under the bed of Dr. Ottorino Barassi,...

01:15.340 --> 01:17.510
...the Italian vice-president of FIFA,...

01:17.840 --> 01:21.040
...to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Nazi army.

01:21.680 --> 01:26.680
In 1966, the Cup was stolen during a public showing of the trophy...

01:26.780 --> 01:29.050
...prior to the World Cup tournament in England.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.120
Luckily, it was found a short time later,...

01:32.390 --> 01:37.090
...none the worse for wear, in a trash container by a little dog named Pickles.

01:37.630 --> 01:42.000
Four years later, Brazil earned permanent possession of the original trophy...

01:42.200 --> 01:44.370
...by winning its third World Cup title.

01:45.040 --> 01:50.980
Unfortunately, the trophy was stolen a second time in 1983 and was never recovered.

01:51.440 --> 01:55.680
The Brazilian Football Association had to have a duplicate trophy made.

01:56.180 --> 02:00.220
After the first trophy became the possession of Brazil's football association,...

02:00.550 --> 02:08.160
...a new World Cup Trophy for FIFA was designed by an Italian artist, Silvio Gazzaniga, in 1974.

02:08.760 --> 02:13.140
This trophy cannot be won outright, but remains in the possession of FIFA,...

02:13.330 --> 02:16.600
...and rest assured they are watching it very closely.

02:17.170 --> 02:22.740
Today, World Cup winners are awarded a replica of the trophy that is gold-plated...

02:22.940 --> 02:25.510
...rather than solid gold like the real one.

02:26.210 --> 02:30.080
Gazzaniga's World Cup trophy weighs almost five kilograms.

02:30.450 --> 02:35.050
Its base contains two layers of a semi-precious stone called malachite...

02:35.250 --> 02:39.660
...and has room for seventeen small plaques bearing the names of the winning teams...

02:40.020 --> 02:44.890
...enough space to honor all the World Cup champions up to the year 2038.

02:45.290 --> 02:48.230
After that, a new trophy will have to be made.
