Welcome to AERA English's Native Maestro.

00:03.505 --> 00:04.623
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:04.877 --> 00:07.867
And this is your program for you to become the native maestro.

00:08.525 --> 00:09.768
Alright. Thanks for watching again.

00:10.109 --> 00:11.549
And today's Maestro Hook.

00:12.080 --> 00:15.746
A Hook is a good conversation piece you can talk with a foreigner when you run out of subjects.

00:16.240 --> 00:21.043
And today's Hook is about swearwords and curse words, and censored words...

00:21.147 --> 00:23.185
...how Japanese people use so much of it.

00:24.310 --> 00:27.524
I know in Japan you can watch a lot of good movies or you listen to good music,...

00:27.633 --> 00:28.951
...and there's a lot of swearwords in it.

00:29.509 --> 00:31.837
And when Japanese people are learning English,...

00:32.070 --> 00:35.895
...they wanna practice and they use these swearwords, but this is horrible.

00:36.610 --> 00:40.461
When a mature person uses bad words, it just doesn't look good...

00:41.112 --> 00:45.831
...especially a woman who wants to express her opinion in good English swears.

00:46.102 --> 00:47.339
Oh! I can't stand it.

00:48.016 --> 00:52.026
So, it's okay to use those words when the situation arises...

00:52.131 --> 00:54.261
...but basically, try to keep your English clean.

00:54.771 --> 00:57.667
Clean English is the best and when you don't really know how to use the words,...

00:57.755 --> 00:58.542
...you shouldn't use it.

00:58.879 --> 01:00.023
Don't try to copy the movies.

01:00.191 --> 01:01.335
The movies are just movies.

01:01.871 --> 01:02.175
Alright?

01:02.330 --> 01:03.686
So please, keep your English clean.

01:04.588 --> 01:04.899
Alright.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.157
So, today's Maestro Menu is connected to that.

01:22.965 --> 01:23.314
Shoot!

01:29.380 --> 01:30.222
Oh, shoot!

01:43.619 --> 01:44.350
And one more.

01:46.799 --> 01:47.589
Oh, darn!

01:55.841 --> 01:56.361
Oh, darn!

02:04.463 --> 02:04.985
Oh, darn!

02:14.351 --> 02:14.629
Alright?

02:15.553 --> 02:17.883
So, Maestro Lines.

02:19.087 --> 02:19.898
A situation like this,...

02:20.331 --> 02:21.477
...you're trying to get water and oh!

02:22.163 --> 02:23.213
Oh, shoot!

02:26.305 --> 02:27.868
Or, you're trying to get milk.

02:28.746 --> 02:29.646
Oh! There's no milk.

02:30.401 --> 02:30.967
Oh, darn!

02:36.156 --> 02:36.747
Oh, shoot!

02:37.487 --> 02:38.040
Oh, darn!

02:40.274 --> 02:42.849
So, use these kinds of words instead of the bad words...

02:42.942 --> 02:46.303
...because it's not good if you use the bad words when you really don't know how it works.

02:46.601 --> 02:46.967
Alright.

02:47.153 --> 02:49.631
So, keep your English clean and learn good English,...

02:49.743 --> 02:51.557
...and become a native maestro in no time.

02:52.317 --> 02:53.476
Okay, that's it for today.

02:53.881 --> 02:55.940
Thanks a lot for watching and see you later...

02:56.357 --> 02:57.449
...and keep your English clean.

02:57.669 --> 02:58.071
Bye-bye!
