00:05.800 --> 00:06.600
What is this place...

00:08.000 --> 00:08.950
...and what are we doing here?

00:10.400 --> 00:11.400
This was my home.

00:14.050 --> 00:18.150
The cybers came, destroyed everything.

00:21.100 --> 00:23.750
We'd better move, they're coming.

00:26.450 --> 00:30.500
To win their freedom, they must take an epic journey.

00:32.050 --> 00:32.900
Let's just keep moving.

00:33.150 --> 00:37.850
Through rugged terrain, they've seen savage machines,...

00:37.950 --> 00:39.400
Why did the mechs try to kill us?

00:39.500 --> 00:40.150
It's all they know.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.850
...and impossible odds.

00:41.900 --> 00:42.700
We're gonna have to fight.

00:55.100 --> 00:56.050
We need to find another way.

00:57.500 --> 00:58.450
There must be survivors.

01:01.100 --> 01:02.500
If you die, I die.

01:03.350 --> 01:04.500
I ain't gonna let that happen.

01:09.800 --> 01:10.800
We don't have much time.

01:16.050 --> 01:17.500
This just gets better and better.
