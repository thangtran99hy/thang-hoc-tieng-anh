Nowadays, most people realize that it's risky to use credit card numbers online.

00:08.200 --> 00:13.850
However, from time to time, we all use passwords and government ID numbers on the Internet.

00:14.350 --> 00:17.300
We think we are safe, but that may not be true!

00:17.950 --> 00:25.900
A new kind of attack is being used by dishonest people to steal IDs and credit card numbers from innocent web surfers.

00:26.550 --> 00:28.950
This new kind of attack is called "phishing."

00:29.550 --> 00:32.000
Phishing sounds the same as the word "fishing,"...

00:32.200 --> 00:37.700
...and it implies that a thief is trying to lure people into giving away valuable information.

00:38.350 --> 00:44.000
Like real fishermen, phishers use bait in the form of great online deals or services.

00:44.400 --> 00:48.450
For example, phishers might use fake emails and false websites...

00:48.650 --> 00:53.950
...to con people into revealing credit card numbers, account usernames, and passwords.

00:54.550 --> 00:58.950
They imitate well-known banks, online sellers, and credit card companies.

00:59.600 --> 01:05.800
Successful phishers may convince as many as five percent of the people they contact to respond...

01:06.050 --> 01:08.700
...and give away their personal financial information.

01:09.450 --> 01:11.100
Is this really a big problem?

01:11.400 --> 01:15.400
Actually, tricking five percent of the online population is huge!

01:15.900 --> 01:20.250
Currently, more than 350 million people have access to the Internet,...

01:20.550 --> 01:25.750
...and seventy-five percent of those Internet users live in the wealthiest countries on Earth.

01:26.450 --> 01:32.000
It has been estimated that phishers send more than three billion scam messages each year.

01:32.600 --> 01:38.000
Even by tricking only five percent of the people, phishers can make a lot of money.

01:38.750 --> 01:42.000
Since there is so much money to make through this kind of scam,...

01:42.250 --> 01:46.150
...it has caught the interest of more than just small-time crooks.

01:46.750 --> 01:51.650
Recently, police tracked down members of an organized phishing group in Eastern Europe,...

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
...who had stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars from people online.

01:56.650 --> 01:59.600
The group created official-looking email messages...

01:59.800 --> 02:05.400
...requesting people to update their personal information at an international bank's website.

02:05.850 --> 02:11.600
However, the link to the bank in the message actually sent people to the phishers' fake website.

02:12.050 --> 02:13.250
To make matters worse,...

02:13.600 --> 02:19.150
...further investigation revealed that this group had connections to a major crime gang in Russia.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.200
How can innocent people protect themselves?

02:22.550 --> 02:27.100
Above all, they have to learn to recognize email that has been sent by a phisher.

02:27.850 --> 02:33.250
Always be wary of any email with urgent requests for personal financial information.

02:33.900 --> 02:38.950
Phishers typically write upsetting or exciting, but fake, statements in their emails...

02:39.200 --> 02:41.550
...so that people will reply right away.

02:42.050 --> 02:46.350
Also, messages from phishers will not address recipients by name...

02:46.650 --> 02:49.650
...because they really don't know who the recipients are yet.

02:50.150 --> 02:55.500
On the other hand, valid messages from your bank or other companies you normally deal with,...

02:55.750 --> 02:57.650
...will typically include your name.
