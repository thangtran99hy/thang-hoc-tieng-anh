00:02.700 --> 00:03.900
It is late at night,...

00:04.350 --> 00:08.800
...you hear a strange noise and feel a cold rush of air move past you.

00:09.250 --> 00:10.250
Was it a ghost?

00:10.500 --> 00:13.700
If you were in Chillingham Castle in Northumberland, England,...

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
...it may have been!

00:15.650 --> 00:20.250
This is because Chillingham is believed to be one of the most haunted castles in England.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.750
For almost 800 years, Chillingham Castle has been the home to ghosts of all different types.

00:27.250 --> 00:32.800
In the early 1900s, visitors to the castle reported seeing the ghost of a little boy.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.450
They gave him the name "Blue Boy"...

00:35.850 --> 00:40.150
...because he was always seen wearing blue clothes and surrounded by a blue light.

00:40.850 --> 00:47.200
Late in the 1920s, workmen fixing a wall in an unused bedroom had an unpleasant surprise.

00:47.550 --> 00:53.200
While working, they discovered the bones of a small child wearing blue clothes buried within the wall.

00:53.800 --> 00:57.650
Interestingly, after these remains were buried in the local cemetery,...

00:58.000 --> 01:00.150
...the ghost boy was never seen again.

01:00.850 --> 01:05.150
Another ghost that has been seen in the castle is that of Lady Mary Berkeley.

01:05.650 --> 01:09.750
She died alone in the castle after her husband left her for another woman.

01:10.500 --> 01:13.950
People have heard the sound of her dress rustling as she walked by.

01:14.600 --> 01:19.400
There is also a painting of Lady Berkeley in the castle that some people say comes to life.

01:19.850 --> 01:24.900
Her ghost has been reported stepping out of the painting and following children around.

01:25.450 --> 01:27.800
Then, there is also the "White Lady".

01:28.500 --> 01:33.400
This spirit is supposed to be the ghost of a woman who was poisoned to death many years ago.

01:34.150 --> 01:38.900
She has been known to go up to people, ask for a drink of water, and then disappear.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.159
With all these reports of ghosts,...

01:41.352 --> 01:43.968
...you might think that people would avoid Chillingham Castle.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.850
After all, most people think of ghosts as scary things.

01:48.350 --> 01:51.800
But, in fact, Chillingham has now turned into a tourist attraction!

01:52.400 --> 01:54.850
Thousands of people visit Chillingham each year.

01:55.500 --> 01:58.700
Some just tour the grounds and eat in the castle tea room,...

01:59.200 --> 02:01.700
...but others actually stay in the castle itself.

02:02.367 --> 02:04.595
A variety of accommodations are available,...

02:04.936 --> 02:07.891
...from rooms in the tower to suites in the coach house.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.000
For those people who want a more special experience,...

02:11.300 --> 02:14.750
...the castle hosts weddings, complete with a medieval banquet.

02:15.250 --> 02:16.550
And that's not all,...

02:17.150 --> 02:21.850
...concerts, operas, and fairs regularly make Chillingham Castle their home.

02:22.400 --> 02:27.300
Chillingham Castle has also been used as a background location for movies and TV shows.

02:27.850 --> 02:32.450
For a haunted castle, Chillingham certainly appears to be remarkably popular.
