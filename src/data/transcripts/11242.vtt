00:07.700 --> 00:09.450
They applauded us when we were right,...

00:12.900 --> 00:14.750
...corrected us when we were wrong,...

00:16.150 --> 00:18.100
...and helped us when we didn't know the difference.

00:19.650 --> 00:21.200
They were tough when they had to be,...

00:22.000 --> 00:23.300
...fun when they wanted to be,...

00:24.750 --> 00:26.200
...fair when they ought to be,...

00:27.800 --> 00:30.200
...and compassionate when they needed to be.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.600
Sure, they taught us I before E except after C,...

00:37.900 --> 00:40.850
...A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y,...

00:42.200 --> 00:47.500
...and who, what, where, when, why, and how.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.900
But they also taught us that we could do anything,...

00:53.000 --> 00:54.100
...and they believed it.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.500
Every good thing in the world,...

00:58.050 --> 01:06.050
...every song, every invention, every accord, every cure, every word...

01:07.300 --> 01:11.700
...exists because at some point, someone wanted to teach...

01:12.550 --> 01:14.900
...and someone else decided to learn.

01:17.600 --> 01:22.050
Here's to the love of learning and all those who choose to embrace it.
