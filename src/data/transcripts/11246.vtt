Lady Gaga loves to shock us with her outrageous getups.

00:06.450 --> 00:10.900
At Sunday night's VMAs, there was this Alexander McQueen number with a gold mohawk.

00:11.100 --> 00:16.100
Then there was her prickly black leather ensemble with a Statue of Liberty-inspired crown.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.200
And then came this juicy getup.

00:18.500 --> 00:21.100
As Gaga accepted the award for video of the year,...

00:21.450 --> 00:23.850
...she asked Cher to hold her meat purse.

00:24.200 --> 00:27.050
And we all realized just how raw her dress was.

00:27.650 --> 00:31.700
Last week, Gaga wore a meat bikini on the cover of Vogue Hommes Japan.

00:31.900 --> 00:34.100
Guess that was just a taste of what was to come...

00:34.700 --> 00:38.000
...'cause she caused a feeding frenzy backstage when she pulled this stunt.

00:38.950 --> 00:41.250
When Ellen Degeneres grilled her about the outfit,...

00:41.350 --> 00:44.700
...she said she meant no disrespect to vegans and vegetarians.

00:45.100 --> 00:47.500
"But, if we don't stand up for what we believe in...

00:47.550 --> 00:49.700
...and if we don't fight for our rights pretty soon,...

00:49.800 --> 00:52.850
...we're going to have as much rights as the meat on our own bones.

00:53.100 --> 00:54.700
And I am not a piece of meat."

00:55.250 --> 00:57.650
So, what did PETA have to say about the butchery?

00:57.850 --> 01:01.000
They say Gaga's lucky she wasn't crawling in maggots.

01:01.350 --> 01:02.000
Nice.
