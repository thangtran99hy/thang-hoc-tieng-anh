00:01.031 --> 00:03.769
This is a glimpse of what the future may look like.

00:03.931 --> 00:08.550
The goal is to have a very affordable, very economical to operate...

00:08.820 --> 00:10.759
...but still a very dependable vehicle.

00:11.235 --> 00:14.523
This car built by Ron Cerven and his Li-ion Motors team...

00:14.651 --> 00:18.357
...is one of 136 vehicles from around the world...

00:18.582 --> 00:21.604
...that competed for the $10 million prize.

00:21.796 --> 00:24.676
The objective: design a car that is fuel-efficient,...

00:24.885 --> 00:28.106
...safe, environmentally friendly and affordable.

00:28.255 --> 00:30.690
Brad Jaeger of the team Edison2.

00:30.787 --> 00:32.866
To have an impact on the world,...

00:33.070 --> 00:37.866
...the car not only has to be more efficient and get good fuel mileage,...

00:38.008 --> 00:38.967
...it has to be cheap.

00:39.348 --> 00:41.301
After going through rigorous testing,...

00:41.385 --> 00:45.345
...the competitors were narrowed down to a few, showcased in Washington.

00:45.657 --> 00:48.224
The top three cars shared the big prize.

00:48.431 --> 00:52.059
Ron Cerven says it's hard to believe his team won the prize.

00:52.153 --> 00:56.711
It's two years' worth of work summed up in a day and I just don't think you can do it.

00:56.851 --> 01:01.835
I think it'll take longer than that to really kind of get the feel for what we did here.
