00:00.400 --> 00:05.100
And that brings me to my first major of two tenets of "Half the Sky"...

00:05.750 --> 00:12.450
...and that is that the central, moral challenge of this century is gender inequity.

00:13.450 --> 00:15.400
In the 19th century, it was slavery.

00:15.850 --> 00:17.900
In the 20th century, it was totalitarianism.

00:18.750 --> 00:25.350
The cause of our time is the brutality that so many people face around the world because of their gender.

00:26.150 --> 00:29.050
So, some of you may be thinking, "Gosh, that's hyperbole."

00:29.700 --> 00:30.750
"She's exaggerating."

00:31.350 --> 00:32.400
Well, let me ask you this question.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.250
How many of you think there are more males or more females in the world?

00:36.350 --> 00:37.000
Let me take a poll.

00:37.050 --> 00:39.050
How many of you think there are more males in the world?

00:39.650 --> 00:40.350
Hands up, please.

00:41.300 --> 00:41.900
How many of you think...

00:41.950 --> 00:42.350
A few.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.150
How many of you think there are more females in the world?

00:44.650 --> 00:45.600
Okay, most of you.

00:46.100 --> 00:47.400
Well you know this latter group, you're wrong.

00:48.950 --> 00:52.000
There are, true enough in Europe, in the West,...

00:52.250 --> 00:56.100
...when women and men have equal access to food and health care,...

00:56.150 --> 00:57.550
...there are more women, we live longer.

00:58.150 --> 01:00.900
But in most of the rest of the world, that's not the case.

01:00.950 --> 01:07.100
In fact, demographers have shown that there are anywhere between 60 million and 100 million...

01:07.150 --> 01:09.650
...missing females in the current population.
