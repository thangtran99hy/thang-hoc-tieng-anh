Hello! Welcome to Michael's Business Top Tips.

00:03.750 --> 00:06.550
This month, we're looking at successful networking.

00:07.350 --> 00:10.050
Now, business networking is an essential skill...

00:10.650 --> 00:13.950
...to find new customers, to build new relationships,...

00:14.350 --> 00:17.650
...find new partners, and to grow your business.

00:18.300 --> 00:20.300
How can you do successful networking?

00:21.100 --> 00:22.900
Here are four steps to help you.

00:23.850 --> 00:26.050
First, use the Internet.

00:26.800 --> 00:30.900
Many business people now use sites like Facebook or Twitter,...

00:31.100 --> 00:34.600
...and other social media to build new business relationships.

00:35.300 --> 00:40.600
I'd recommend especially this one, www.linkedin.com.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.250
This one is especially focused on business professionals,...

00:44.500 --> 00:46.100
...who want to network online...

00:46.700 --> 00:49.600
...and it has over 75 million members globally.

00:50.900 --> 00:53.950
Second, seek networking opportunities.

00:54.400 --> 00:58.300
Every business trip, exhibition, conference, training seminar,...

00:58.600 --> 01:02.650
...these are all wonderful opportunities to build new business networks.

01:03.300 --> 01:06.700
Don't be shy, go up and speak to people you don't know.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.500
Remember to smile, make eye contact,...

01:09.800 --> 01:13.600
...and use a confident handshake to make a good first impression.

01:14.950 --> 01:18.100
Third, discover common interests.

01:18.700 --> 01:20.650
Don't just talk about business.

01:21.100 --> 01:24.050
Also, try and find out what they're like as a person.

01:24.550 --> 01:29.950
For example, sports or hobbies, or interests, or hometown, travel experiences.

01:30.300 --> 01:32.700
This builds a much closer relationship.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.050
Fourth and finally, follow up.

01:37.700 --> 01:42.100
It's very important once you've met somebody, contact them sooner after.

01:42.900 --> 01:45.000
I'd recommend emails on the next day.

01:45.450 --> 01:50.650
Say how nice it was to meet them and express hope to see them again soon in the future.

01:51.500 --> 01:56.100
Remember, you never know who will be the next big customer for your business.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.600
Thank you and good luck.
