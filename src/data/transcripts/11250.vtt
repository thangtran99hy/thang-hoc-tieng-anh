Welcome to the AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:04.500 --> 00:05.950
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:06.350 --> 00:10.500
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:11.650 --> 00:19.600
Today's Maestro Hook is about the different cultures between ghosts and scary things in Japan and in America.

00:20.150 --> 00:26.000
Now, the very interesting thing is in America, ghosts, when you consider ghosts,...

00:26.350 --> 00:29.350
...they are things that don't really exist in the real world.

00:29.950 --> 00:34.800
Now in Japan, ghosts are usually people that passed away or they're your ancestors.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.750
Freddy, Jason, and the Halloween guy, all the scary ghosts don't really exist,...

00:41.850 --> 00:45.050
...but in Japan, a lot of ghosts are the dead, the people that died before.

00:45.750 --> 00:52.300
So, today's Maestro Lines, today's Maestro Menu is about situations and scary situations...

00:52.400 --> 00:53.900
...that you can use with this type of English.

00:54.500 --> 00:55.450
Okay, the first one.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.650
I got goose bumps.

01:10.300 --> 01:11.400
I got goose bumps.

01:12.150 --> 01:14.000
Oh, that was scary! I got goose bumps.

01:19.900 --> 01:20.550
And next.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.700
I got cold sweat.

01:34.500 --> 01:35.550
I got cold sweat.

01:40.500 --> 01:41.300
I got goose bumps.

01:41.900 --> 01:42.700
I got cold sweat.

01:44.300 --> 01:48.000
Okay. So, a situation like Maestro Menu, Maestro Lines.

01:50.150 --> 01:52.600
Oh, that ghost story was very scary,...

01:52.650 --> 01:54.600
...I got goose bumps up and down my shoulders.

01:57.400 --> 01:57.850
Cold sweat.

01:58.550 --> 02:00.650
Oh, he almost got run over by a car!

02:00.800 --> 02:02.800
I got cold sweat, but I'm glad he's okay.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.700
