So, how did you come up with the idea of singing "After Tonight" in Japanese?

00:07.900 --> 00:10.550
Well, it came to me from Ichisan.

00:10.700 --> 00:13.500
It was the record company guy that I've worked with.

00:14.100 --> 00:18.700
And he asked me about it a while ago. I was kinda skeptical about it and if I wanted to do it.

00:20.850 --> 00:24.800
And then over time I realized that it would actually just be a great experience,...

00:24.850 --> 00:29.800
...and nice for me to sing in Japanese 'cause I used to speak it when I was younger,...

00:30.500 --> 00:33.050
...and that's a beautiful language.

00:33.950 --> 00:34.350
It is?

00:34.450 --> 00:35.800
It is, yeah.

00:38.500 --> 00:40.100
But, what made you change your mind?

00:42.200 --> 00:47.100
Just that, there's no need not to do it, you know?

00:47.150 --> 00:53.100
And I used to take things a lot more seriously, and I'm kinda slowing down from that...

00:53.150 --> 01:00.300
...because sometimes, I take the perspective of just the negative opinion or something like that...

01:00.350 --> 01:05.900
...and now I'm certain to decide things more from a positive place,...

01:05.950 --> 01:10.350
...and singing in Japanese is positive. It's great.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.950
It should be a great experience.
