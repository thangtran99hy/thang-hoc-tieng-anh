00:00.300 --> 00:03.700
65 million years ago, reptiles ruled the world.

00:05.100 --> 00:09.300
On land, in the air,...

00:19.400 --> 00:22.250
...and reptiles were kings in all the seas as well,...

00:30.150 --> 00:32.600
...but then came a great cataclysm from outer space.

00:33.050 --> 00:36.000
An asteroid 12 miles in diameter struck the Earth.

00:37.600 --> 00:42.400
This asteroid's massive impact unleashed the power of more than 100 atomic bombs.

00:43.350 --> 00:44.400
The sky went dark...

00:44.900 --> 00:47.150
...and the Earth's climate changed drastically.

00:47.500 --> 00:51.400
70% of all life on the planet perished.
