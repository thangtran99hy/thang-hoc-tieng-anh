Welcome to Aera English TV's Native Maestro.

00:02.700 --> 00:03.850
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:04.150 --> 00:07.050
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:07.500 --> 00:10.350
Now in the past, I've had some guests in my own show like Imran...

00:10.750 --> 00:12.150
...and today, I have a new guest.

00:12.400 --> 00:13.250
This is Ikuyo.

00:14.300 --> 00:14.950
Hi, Seita!

00:15.000 --> 00:17.850
Hey! Can you help these guys become a native maestro?

00:17.950 --> 00:18.350
Sure!

00:18.450 --> 00:19.400
Alright, thanks a lot!

00:19.500 --> 00:20.250
Thanks, Seita!

00:21.000 --> 00:22.400
Hi! This is Ikuyo.

00:22.900 --> 00:24.400
So, today's Maestro Hook.

00:25.350 --> 00:30.350
If your English is not so good and if you're lost for words while you are talking,...

00:30.650 --> 00:33.000
...there is a good way to keep a steady pace.

00:33.650 --> 00:39.550
And put words like, "well" or, "let's see" or, "let me think".

00:40.050 --> 00:42.700
So, these words help you keep a steady pace,...

00:43.250 --> 00:44.100
...so please use them.

00:45.450 --> 00:46.800
So, today's Maestro Menu.

01:01.300 --> 01:04.250
I got plans.

01:04.750 --> 01:05.800
I got plans.

01:14.100 --> 01:14.800
I'm busy.

01:18.850 --> 01:19.800
I got plans.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.050
I got a plan.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.450
It's not for me.

01:44.550 --> 01:46.100
It's not for me.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.100
It's not for me.

02:14.050 --> 02:14.650
No, thank you.

02:20.750 --> 02:22.750
So, Maestro Lines.

02:23.500 --> 02:24.550
Seita, can you help me?

02:24.900 --> 02:26.800
Yup. Use these sentences?

02:26.900 --> 02:27.500
Yup, sure.

02:27.650 --> 02:30.400
Okay. Ikuyo, we have a business meeting at 8 o'clock.

02:30.450 --> 02:30.950
Can you make it?

02:31.050 --> 02:34.100
Oh, well 8 o'clock. Sorry, I got plans.

02:34.150 --> 02:34.850
Oh, you got plans?

02:34.900 --> 02:35.750
Yeah, I can't make it.

02:35.800 --> 02:36.200
Okay.

02:36.800 --> 02:37.400
I'm sorry about it.

02:37.600 --> 02:38.000
No problem.

02:38.500 --> 02:39.300
So, like this.

02:39.700 --> 02:40.550
So, the next one.

02:41.900 --> 02:42.850
Okay, in a...

02:43.350 --> 02:45.200
Oh! So yeah, at a clothing job.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.500
Oh, miss! Do you like this shirt?

02:47.750 --> 02:48.150
What do you think?

02:48.250 --> 02:50.750
Oh, well I'm sorry it's not for me.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.050
No? You don't like it?

02:52.600 --> 02:53.800
Not really. I'm sorry about it.

02:54.450 --> 02:55.100
Thank you, no problem.

02:56.050 --> 02:56.900
Okay, like that.

02:57.450 --> 02:57.650
Yup.

02:58.600 --> 03:01.400
So, I think that's it...

03:01.700 --> 03:03.350
...and I hope you enjoyed it.

03:03.700 --> 03:05.200
So, see you later.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.000
Thank you. Bye-bye!
