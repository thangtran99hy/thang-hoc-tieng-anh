00:03.500 --> 00:06.000
I missed more than 9,000 shots in my career.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
I've lost almost 300 games.

00:13.750 --> 00:19.100
26 times, I've been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.100
I've failed over and over, and over again in my life...

00:26.500 --> 00:29.100
...and that is why I succeed.
