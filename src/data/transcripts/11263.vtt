Hi, my name is Jeremy Gilley.

00:01.933 --> 00:02.901
I'm a filmmaker.

00:03.325 --> 00:06.377
In 1998, I was sick and hurt about what was going on in the world.

00:06.474 --> 00:09.319
The starvation, the destruction, the killing of innocent people.

00:09.378 --> 00:12.967
I was trying to make sense of a war that I was growing up in and finding it difficult.

00:14.584 --> 00:17.381
And so, I wanted to see if I can make a film about peace.

00:17.850 --> 00:19.585
But I realized there was no day of peace.

00:19.674 --> 00:23.041
There was nothing that united the world above politics and above religion.

00:23.182 --> 00:24.945
We have an Earth Day, we have a Valentine's Day.

00:25.107 --> 00:26.373
We should surely have a Peace Day.

00:26.948 --> 00:32.275
So, I decided to try and establish the first ever Peace Day with a fixed calendar day.

00:32.613 --> 00:35.389
A day of ceasefire, a day of nonviolence,...

00:35.472 --> 00:39.489
...a day of intercultural cooperation on a scale that we've never known before.

00:40.184 --> 00:42.029
So, I set out in 1999...

00:42.173 --> 00:45.070
...and I traveled the world meeting people like the Dalai Lama, Kofi Annan,...

00:45.144 --> 00:47.782
....Shimon Peres, Dr. Oscar Arias, Mary Robinson;...

00:47.863 --> 00:51.795
...going into Burundi, Somalia, Gaza, West Bank, India, Sri Lanka, Central America;...

00:51.904 --> 00:52.727
...all over the world.

00:53.150 --> 00:55.847
What I learned is, from speaking to humanitarians...

00:55.958 --> 00:58.490
...who are dealing with saving people's lives on a daily basis,...

00:58.706 --> 01:00.751
...is that if we had a day of ceasefire and nonviolence,...

01:00.875 --> 01:05.372
...we can immunize children, move aid, lives could be saved, children could be inspired.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.377
It was a day that had immense benefit.
