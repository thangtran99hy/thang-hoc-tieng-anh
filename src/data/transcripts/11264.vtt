As American as apple pie,...

00:03.300 --> 00:06.783
...the old-fashioned hamburger is going through some design changes...

00:07.033 --> 00:09.833
...thanks in part to the worst recession since the 1930s.

00:10.367 --> 00:13.783
Greg Cook is head chef at the BLT Mirage in Las Vegas.

00:14.167 --> 00:15.917
I think with the economy the way it is now,...

00:16.967 --> 00:19.917
...honestly, I think there is more room for profit in a burger restaurant...

00:20.167 --> 00:21.517
...than there is in a steak house right now.

00:22.033 --> 00:26.250
I think that the general public, I think you can always afford to have a burger.

00:26.700 --> 00:28.850
And restaurants have been quick to capitalize.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.883
At the Munch Bar at Caesars Palace,...

00:31.167 --> 00:36.783

00:36.967 --> 00:39.050
We're using certified Black Angus beef.

00:39.133 --> 00:40.783
It's all organic, no hormones.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.350
We go in the farmers' markets every day, picking out the ingredients,...

00:44.667 --> 00:47.429
...the lettuces, you know, washing them ourselves...

00:47.502 --> 00:49.883
...and doing all the organic romaines and icebergs,...

00:49.950 --> 00:52.879
...and different boutique lettuces like red leaf,...

00:53.175 --> 00:56.917
...making our own jalapeno mayonnaise, spicy remoulades,...

00:57.000 --> 00:59.217
...little relishes, homemade relishes from scratch.

00:59.833 --> 01:01.917
It takes a lot of stuff that goes into this every day...

01:01.950 --> 01:05.650
...and our guys start early in the morning prepping the ingredients fresh daily.
