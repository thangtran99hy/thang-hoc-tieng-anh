00:04.500 --> 00:06.450
Wow, all we need is a banjo.

00:07.900 --> 00:08.800
Keep your voice down,...

00:09.600 --> 00:11.050
...don't make any sudden moves.

00:11.800 --> 00:12.900
Just stay close to me.

00:13.700 --> 00:15.300
Don't use your cellphone,...

00:15.350 --> 00:16.500
You took my cellphone.

00:16.550 --> 00:19.050
...talk about cellphones, don't talk about satellites.

00:19.300 --> 00:20.200
Seriously?

00:22.050 --> 00:23.000
Why are you trying to kill me?

00:23.200 --> 00:24.400
Why would I be trying to kill you?

00:24.500 --> 00:26.750
Because the last time we met, I tried to kill you.

00:26.900 --> 00:28.150
That was a long time ago.

00:28.350 --> 00:30.400
Some people hold on to things like that.

00:31.350 --> 00:32.600
Come on, I'll show you the house.

00:34.600 --> 00:35.200
What's that?

00:36.850 --> 00:37.250
Decoy.

00:38.350 --> 00:39.250
He lives in a car?

00:45.200 --> 00:46.250
This guy's insane.

00:47.200 --> 00:50.000
He was given daily doses of LSD for 11 years.

00:52.300 --> 00:53.850
Well in that case, he looks great.

00:54.050 --> 00:54.600
Fantastic.

00:54.650 --> 00:55.000
Yeah.

00:55.750 --> 00:56.750
Red.
