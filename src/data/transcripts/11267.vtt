Welcome to AERA English's Native Maestro.

00:03.300 --> 00:04.350
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:04.600 --> 00:08.400
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:08.550 --> 00:10.500
Now, today's Maestro Hook.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.700
The Maestro Hook is a conversation piece you can use with a foreigner when you run out of topics.

00:15.300 --> 00:18.700
Today's Maestro Hook is about heroes in a movie in the States.

00:19.150 --> 00:23.050
Now remember, when a hero is in a very devastating situation,...

00:23.250 --> 00:25.950
...in a foreign movie, they always make a joke.

00:26.350 --> 00:27.350
They act really funny.

00:28.000 --> 00:28.700
Why is that?

00:29.300 --> 00:32.450
In Japanese movies, they never do that because it's a very serious scene.

00:32.900 --> 00:39.300
But in foreign movies, the superheroes want to show that they are very confident and they are not worried.

00:39.500 --> 00:43.050
So, for example, he's in a tight situation, he says,...

00:43.500 --> 00:46.200
..."Ha! I wonder what I'm gonna have for lunch today." Like that.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.300
So, this is Western culture.

00:48.400 --> 00:51.000
All superheroes do that. So please, when you watch a movie, check it out.

00:51.800 --> 00:52.050
Now,...

01:03.450 --> 01:04.700
Not in my dictionary.

01:05.350 --> 01:06.500
Not in my dictionary.

01:14.350 --> 01:15.200
Not in my dictionary.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.200
Just who do you think I am?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.400
Just who do you think I am?

01:41.550 --> 01:42.700
Just who do you think I am?

01:44.650 --> 01:46.800
Okay. So, Maestro Lines.

01:49.100 --> 01:51.300
Oh! We're never gonna finish that report in time.

01:52.050 --> 01:53.250
Not in my dictionary!

01:59.350 --> 02:01.350
I can't believe you finished the report in time.

02:01.850 --> 02:03.500
Ha! Just who do you think I am?

02:08.450 --> 02:09.950
Okay, I think they're here.

02:10.050 --> 02:13.500
So, that's it for today's news and I'll see you guys later on Maestro Menu.

02:13.850 --> 02:14.250
Bye-bye!
