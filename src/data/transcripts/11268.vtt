We have an idea that we'd like to talk to you about.

00:05.900 --> 00:07.150
It's gonna be online any second.

00:07.250 --> 00:08.000
This is gonna be new.

00:08.050 --> 00:09.100
So, who should we send it to first?

00:09.200 --> 00:10.100
Just a couple of people.

00:10.350 --> 00:12.400
The question is, who are they gonna send it to?

00:13.300 --> 00:16.200
The site got 2,200 hits within two hours?

00:16.400 --> 00:18.550
1,000. 22,000.

00:19.350 --> 00:21.400
They don't want you. They want your idea.

00:21.550 --> 00:22.450
We don't know what it can be.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.450
We don't know what it will be.

00:23.500 --> 00:24.300
We know that it is cool.

00:25.050 --> 00:27.050
Let's sue him in federal court.

00:27.150 --> 00:28.750
If you guys were the inventors of Facebook,...

00:29.150 --> 00:30.000
...you'd have invented Facebook.

00:30.100 --> 00:32.100
Is there anything that you need to tell me?

00:32.900 --> 00:33.950
One million dollars isn't cool.

00:34.050 --> 00:34.600
You know what's cool?

00:35.000 --> 00:36.050
One billion dollars.

00:36.150 --> 00:39.150
I can't wait to stand over your shoulder and watch you write us a check.

00:39.250 --> 00:39.700
Mark!

00:41.400 --> 00:45.200
Your best friend is suing you for 600 million dollars.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.000
Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention?

00:49.850 --> 00:50.050
No.
