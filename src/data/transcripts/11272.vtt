00:00.450 --> 00:02.600
So, I'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today...

00:02.900 --> 00:05.550
...imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years.

00:06.700 --> 00:10.950
But before I do that, I need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics,...

00:11.350 --> 00:13.150
...which require huge amounts of energy to create...

00:13.900 --> 00:17.450
...and, because of their disposal issues, are slowly poisoning our planet.

00:18.400 --> 00:23.600
I also want to tell you and share with you how my team and I have been using mushrooms over the last three years.

00:25.100 --> 00:25.700
Not like that.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.200
We're using mushrooms to create an entirely new class of materials,...

00:30.550 --> 00:32.750
...which perform a lot like plastics during their use,...

00:33.050 --> 00:37.500
...but are made from crop waste and are totally compostable at the end of their lives.

00:38.450 --> 00:41.200
Because in nature, mushrooms are the recycling system.

00:41.800 --> 00:46.100
And what we've discovered is that by using a part of the mushroom you've probably never seen,...

00:46.800 --> 00:49.100
...analogous to its root structure, it's called "mycelium",...

00:49.750 --> 00:53.400
...we can actually grow materials with many of the same properties of conventional synthetics.

00:54.700 --> 00:57.925
Now, mycelium is an amazing material, because it's a self-assembling material...

00:57.975 --> 01:00.350
...it actually takes things we would consider waste,...

01:00.600 --> 01:02.950
...things like seed husks or woody biomass,...

01:03.500 --> 01:05.450
...and can transform them into a chitinous polymer,...

01:05.650 --> 01:07.250
...which you can form into almost any shape.

01:07.300 --> 01:10.350
In our process, we basically use it as a glue.

01:11.500 --> 01:12.850
And by using mycelium as a glue,...

01:13.150 --> 01:15.600
...you can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry,...

01:16.300 --> 01:18.550
...and you can create materials with many different properties,...

01:19.150 --> 01:24.750
...materials that are insulating, fire-resistant, moisture-resistant, vapor-resistant,...

01:25.050 --> 01:28.350
...materials that can absorb impacts, that can absorb acoustical impacts.

01:28.950 --> 01:33.100
But these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts, not made out of petroleum.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.750
And because they're made of natural materials,...

01:36.450 --> 01:39.100
...they're 100 percent compostable in your own backyard.
