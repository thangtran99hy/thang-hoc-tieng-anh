00:00.350 --> 00:03.100
These days, robots are more common than you might think...

00:03.250 --> 00:05.450
...like this Roomba robotic vacuum.

00:06.250 --> 00:09.050
We wanted to do something simple that people could use every day...

00:09.250 --> 00:11.650
...and that's what inspired us to build the Roomba.

00:11.700 --> 00:13.850
We wanted to be helpful around the house.

00:14.050 --> 00:16.750
Helen Greiner is co-founder of iRobot.

00:16.950 --> 00:18.750
It makes everything from the Roomba...

00:18.900 --> 00:20.950
...to remote-controlled bomb disposal units,...

00:21.000 --> 00:23.400
...to robots that someday might be part of us.

00:23.700 --> 00:26.200
You can have robotics incorporated into your body...

00:26.500 --> 00:29.617
...to give back that arm or leg that you've lost either in service,...

00:29.703 --> 00:32.719
...or through some accident, or disease.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.300
The robots featured at the annual convention of the Association for Unmanned Vehicles International...

00:38.350 --> 00:40.050
...were mostly for military use,...

00:40.350 --> 00:44.800
...but association president Michael Toscano says civilian uses are growing.

00:45.133 --> 00:48.113
Whether it be firefighting, whether it be first responders,...

00:48.191 --> 00:51.017
...whether it be disaster response,...

00:51.150 --> 00:54.450
...unmanned systems allow human beings to be able to do their mission...

00:54.800 --> 00:57.300
...with an extension of their hands, their eyes, and their ears.

00:58.250 --> 01:02.000
Remote-controlled landrovers can detonate bombs or buried land mines.
