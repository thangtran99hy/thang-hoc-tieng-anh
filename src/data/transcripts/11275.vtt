Italians have long celebrated Christopher Columbus in tribute to their shared heritage.

00:08.900 --> 00:10.600
Let's take a look at Christopher Columbus,...

00:10.950 --> 00:13.700
...the man behind the myth, behind the holiday.

00:16.550 --> 00:17.800
We all know how it started.

00:18.150 --> 00:24.600
On August 3rd, 1492, Columbus and his three ships: the NiÃ±a, the Pinta and the Santa MarÃ­a...

00:24.900 --> 00:27.850
...set out from Spain and embarked on a historic journey.

00:28.650 --> 00:31.550
True, but let's settle the "why" once and for all.

00:32.450 --> 00:35.100
Columbus wasn't trying to prove the Earth was round.

00:35.500 --> 00:36.300
He didn't need to.

00:39.850 --> 00:46.150
Greek mathematician, Pythagoras, suspected we were living on a sphere as early as the 6th century B.C....

00:46.600 --> 00:49.400
...and Aristotle backed him up two centuries later...

00:49.700 --> 00:53.250
...when he noticed the Earth's shadow could be seen during a lunar eclipse,...

00:53.500 --> 00:57.250
...sliding past the Moon in miniature, and it was round.

00:58.950 --> 01:01.550
So, why did Columbus bother getting off the couch at all?

01:02.350 --> 01:02.650
Money.

01:03.400 --> 01:06.200
In the 15th century, spices were a hot commodity.

01:06.550 --> 01:09.850
Traders shipping them between Asia and Europe could get rich quick.

01:11.050 --> 01:13.850
However, with the fall of Constantinople to the Turks,...

01:14.200 --> 01:17.450
...Europe lost its most popular route to the treasures of the East.

01:19.250 --> 01:21.350
Columbus realized his opportunity:...

01:21.550 --> 01:24.800
...become the first person to plot a western route to Asia...

01:25.050 --> 01:27.750
...and enjoy unprecedented glory and riches.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.950
So, on that August morning in 1492, Columbus and his men sailed off in those famous ships,...

01:35.250 --> 01:37.700
...laden with hopes of finding their way to Asia,...

01:38.100 --> 01:41.300
...and making both Spain and themselves a heck of a lot of money.

01:41.950 --> 01:44.350
Columbus returned to the Spanish court a hero.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.300
All were convinced the route was a success...

01:47.700 --> 01:48.850
...and it surely was,...

01:49.250 --> 01:50.550
...but not as they'd expected.

01:51.600 --> 01:56.350
Columbus inadvertently achieved the monumental task of joining the two hemispheres.

01:56.600 --> 01:59.550
In effect, doubling the size of the habitable planet...

01:59.800 --> 02:02.350
...and establishing trade between the continents.
