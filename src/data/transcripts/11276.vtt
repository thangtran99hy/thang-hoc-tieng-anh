00:01.850 --> 00:03.200
We take so much for granted...

00:03.250 --> 00:06.750
...like going to school, watching TV, seeing a movie, keeping you warm at night.

00:06.900 --> 00:08.460
It's easy to forget that every day,...

00:08.545 --> 00:11.514
...millions of people living in poverty are fighting for their lives.

00:11.650 --> 00:12.750
Progress is being made.

00:12.950 --> 00:14.850
Tens of millions more kids in school.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.600
Millions more people on lifesaving AIDS medicine...

00:17.800 --> 00:20.750
...and malaria deaths cut in half in countries all across Africa,...

00:20.900 --> 00:21.900
...but more needs to be done.

00:22.050 --> 00:24.800
This is not about charity, it's about justice.

00:24.900 --> 00:25.600
It's about equality.

00:25.900 --> 00:29.850
Over the course of history, young people, people like us have made a difference.

00:29.900 --> 00:30.900
We have changed laws.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.050
We have broken barriers.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.400
We have decided elections.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.700
We can defeat extreme poverty and preventable disease...

00:36.750 --> 00:39.600
...by all working together across borders, time zones, and cultures...

00:39.650 --> 00:41.550
...through awareness, advocacy, and action.

00:41.650 --> 00:43.700
As college students, you have the power.

00:43.900 --> 00:45.650
You have the power to build a better future.

00:45.750 --> 00:46.700
Create a buzz.

00:46.750 --> 00:48.850
The more people talk, the more we can accomplish.

00:48.950 --> 00:51.350
You and me, all of us, coming together as one.

00:51.450 --> 00:51.700
One.

00:52.000 --> 00:52.550
As one.

00:52.600 --> 00:53.250
Join us.

00:53.300 --> 00:54.500
