Essay about the future.

00:05.587 --> 00:11.224
In the future, a telephone will be so small, that we can put it in our pocket...

00:11.347 --> 00:13.124
...and take it with us everywhere.

00:14.067 --> 00:17.880
We can see whom we're speaking with on a small screen...

00:17.964 --> 00:22.136
...and we can watch the news and TV shows on the phone all day.

00:23.223 --> 00:29.431
We can also listen to the radio by putting tiny speakers into our ears.

00:30.357 --> 00:32.657
The phone will have a built-in camera.

00:34.131 --> 00:37.273
You can see live football matches on the phone.

00:37.669 --> 00:42.697
You can play fun games and send pictures and messages through the air.

00:43.978 --> 00:47.734
There's also a kind of gramophone inside the phone...

00:47.829 --> 00:52.891
...and thousands of great songs will come into the phone through the air.

00:58.070 --> 00:59.493
And do you know what else?

00:59.879 --> 01:04.683
You can make your own movie with your phone and you can record sounds.

01:05.053 --> 01:09.202
And you can even create your own ringtones!
