This year, the planet's digital content will blast through the zettabyte barrier...

00:06.441 --> 00:09.279
...that is approximately equal to one million times...

00:09.380 --> 00:12.040
...that is approximately equal to one million times the information stored in all the libraries in the US,...

00:12.350 --> 00:15.100
...but finding the right information should feel easy.

00:15.400 --> 00:16.700
It should feel like magic...

00:17.200 --> 00:18.550
...and we're getting closer to that.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.150
At Google, we innovate to make search faster and more relevant every day.

00:23.700 --> 00:26.400
The new experience transforms search,...

00:26.850 --> 00:30.150
...delivering results instantly, in a way that has never been done before.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.494
Now, results appear automatically as you type,...

00:33.797 --> 00:36.390
Now, results appear automatically as you type, with no need to hit "Enter" or click the "Search" button.

00:36.750 --> 00:39.750
As soon as you see what you need predicted in gray text,...

00:40.000 --> 00:43.450
...you can stop typing and just look down to find your results waiting.

00:44.150 --> 00:46.975
I don't even have to scroll. It's right there!

00:47.050 --> 00:48.900
I didn't have to press "Enter".

00:49.050 --> 00:49.700
It was really quick.

00:50.250 --> 00:53.450
Seeing results instantly lets you refine your search as you type.

00:53.750 --> 00:56.600
Looking for a bird? A map? A recipe?

00:57.150 --> 01:00.800
You'll know instantly if you're on the right track to finding exactly what you want,...

01:01.000 --> 01:02.800
...so you can adapt your search on the fly.

01:03.400 --> 01:08.550
Improving the speed and precision people have come to expect from Google was an incredible engineering challenge.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.350
When we came to the infrastructure team and said,...

01:10.550 --> 01:14.250
..."We're going to be serving many times more result pages for every query performed",...

01:14.400 --> 01:15.400
...they thought we were insane.

01:15.600 --> 01:19.000
Even before this improvement, Google was serving more than a billion searches per day.

01:19.650 --> 01:22.300
We had to find efficient ways to address increased demand.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.400
Search is a hard problem that's far from solved,...

01:25.750 --> 01:30.450
...but at Google, we are constantly innovating so you can think less about how to search,...
