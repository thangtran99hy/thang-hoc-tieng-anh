00:02.350 --> 00:04.150
Go into a room with a mirror.

00:04.600 --> 00:05.900
Turn off all the lights.

00:06.350 --> 00:10.750
Light a candle, look into the mirror, and start chanting "Bloody Mary."

00:11.300 --> 00:13.750
Say this spooky phrase thirteen times,...

00:14.100 --> 00:17.100
...and the image of Bloody Mary will appear in the mirror!

00:17.850 --> 00:20.750
She will be standing behind you, over your left shoulder!

00:21.350 --> 00:25.950
But beware: Bloody Mary has surprises waiting for those who call her.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.450
She sometimes kills the caller.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.800
Other times, she scratches out his or her eyes.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.900
She can drive the person crazy.

00:34.450 --> 00:38.100
Sometimes, she grabs people and pulls them into the mirror with her!

00:38.950 --> 00:42.550
The urban legend of Bloody Mary has been around for generations.

00:43.050 --> 00:47.400
School kids all around the world have entered dark bathrooms to try this game.

00:48.100 --> 00:52.500
Many run away in fright as they say "Bloody Mary" for the thirteenth time.

00:53.350 --> 00:58.250
In 1978, folklorist Janet Langlois became interested in the legend.

00:58.800 --> 01:03.100
At that time, the legend was already widespread around the United States.

01:03.600 --> 01:07.350
Langlois visited a Catholic girls' school and interviewed eighty students.

01:07.900 --> 01:11.350
She compared their stories and determined that the story of Bloody Mary...

01:11.650 --> 01:15.100
...might come from an old legend about the crying ghost of a woman...

01:15.400 --> 01:17.800
...who eternally searches for her murdered children.

01:18.350 --> 01:21.500
However, no one really knows who Mary may have been.

01:22.300 --> 01:26.750
The Bloody Mary legend is renewed with each generation of daring adolescents.

01:27.350 --> 01:28.450
Generations from now,...

01:28.750 --> 01:33.650
...school children will probably still be scaring themselves with this timeless, terrifying legend.
