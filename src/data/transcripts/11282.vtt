00:03.050 --> 00:05.450
Dale Kaczmarek believes in ghosts...

00:05.950 --> 00:09.950
...and he has been the president of the Ghost Research Society since 1982.

00:10.750 --> 00:15.000
In his career, Kaczmarek has met many people who do not believe in ghosts...

00:15.800 --> 00:19.800
...and when they find out he is a ghost expert, they think he is a fool.

00:20.700 --> 00:24.900
So, one of Kaczmarek's goals is to make ghost research more scientific.

00:25.950 --> 00:30.200
Not all people believe in ghosts, but most people trust science.

00:30.950 --> 00:36.100
So, if ghost research becomes scientific, more people will respect Kaczmarek's work.

00:36.900 --> 00:40.400
Kaczmarek follows a careful process to investigate ghosts.

00:41.150 --> 00:44.950
The first step happens when someone telephones Kaczmarek about a ghost.

00:45.706 --> 00:47.088
During the first phone call,...

00:47.321 --> 00:51.927
...Kaczmarek interviews the caller to determine if it is a serious case or a hoax.

00:52.650 --> 00:57.050
Next, Kaczmarek asks the caller what he or she wants him to do.

00:57.850 --> 01:01.300
Some people want him to find out the cause of the paranormal activity,...

01:02.050 --> 01:05.100
...while other people want him to remove a ghost from their house.

01:05.745 --> 01:06.901
After the phone call,...

01:07.307 --> 01:10.818
...Kaczmarek contacts other members of the Ghost Research Society...

01:10.950 --> 01:13.550
...and Kaczmarek makes a team from a few members.

01:14.250 --> 01:16.500
They visit the house where the ghost was reported,...

01:16.900 --> 01:19.700
...but he never tells the members any details about the case.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.600
This is very important to keep the investigation objective...

01:24.200 --> 01:27.550
...because if they know the details, they might imagine seeing something.

01:28.400 --> 01:32.450
After a thorough inspection of the location, the team talks to the homeowner...

01:32.950 --> 01:35.700
...and they share what they have observed with each other for the first time.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.850
By waiting until this time to share the details,...

01:39.450 --> 01:42.900
...Kaczmarek believes that his method of investigation is more scientific.

01:43.700 --> 01:48.800
Kaczmarek has shared his expertise of ghosts by writing books and giving tours of haunted places.

01:49.400 --> 01:53.700
Kaczmarek wrote a book called "Windy City Ghosts" about ghosts in Chicago.

01:54.600 --> 01:58.750
One of the stories in this book is about ghost horses and their ghost riders.

01:59.450 --> 02:02.350
People sometimes see these ghosts on 95th Street,...

02:02.950 --> 02:06.450
...which is a busy street that runs through the forest near some horse stables.

02:07.250 --> 02:12.200
People ride horses from these stables into the forest and they must cross 95th Street.

02:13.024 --> 02:15.175
Over the years, there have been several accidents...

02:15.253 --> 02:18.471
...in which horses and riders were killed by fast-moving cars.

02:19.087 --> 02:21.629
Sometimes at night, people driving through the forest...

02:21.991 --> 02:25.315
...report seeing transparent horses and riders crossing the street.

02:25.800 --> 02:28.600
They stop their cars to let the horses and riders pass,...

02:29.250 --> 02:32.600
...but when they look closely, the horses and riders have disappeared!

02:33.650 --> 02:37.900
All of these reports have come from the area where the horse trail crosses 95th Street.

02:38.950 --> 02:44.550
Kaczmarek gives tours to this location and tries to explain the world of ghost research to his guests.

02:45.150 --> 02:49.300
Through his books, tours, and the scientific process of his investigations,...

02:49.700 --> 02:52.900
...Kaczmarek is improving the reputation of ghost researchers.
