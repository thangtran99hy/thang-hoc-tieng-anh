One of my favorite parts about my job at the Gates Foundation is that I get to travel to the developing world...

00:06.367 --> 00:07.883
...and I do that quite regularly.

00:08.867 --> 00:12.167
And when I meet the mothers in so many of these remote places,...

00:12.600 --> 00:15.417
...I'm really struck by the things that we have in common.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.650
They want what we want for our children,...

00:18.917 --> 00:21.330
...and that is for their children to grow up successful,...

00:21.833 --> 00:23.817
...to be healthy and have a successful life.

00:25.067 --> 00:27.650
But I also see lots of poverty...

00:28.533 --> 00:29.850
...and it's quite jarring,...

00:30.633 --> 00:32.717
...both in the scale and the scope of it.

00:33.567 --> 00:37.183
My first trip in India, I was in a person's home where they had dirt floors,...

00:37.483 --> 00:42.083
...no running water, no electricity, and that's really what I see all over the world.

00:43.100 --> 00:47.850
So in short, I'm startled by all the things that they don't have.

00:49.700 --> 00:54.383
But I am surprised by one thing that they do have: Coca-Cola.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.217
Coke is everywhere.

00:57.567 --> 01:00.683
In fact, when I travel to the developing world, Coke feels ubiquitous.

01:01.433 --> 01:04.759
And so, when I come back from these trips, and I'm thinking about development,...

01:04.846 --> 01:06.109
...and I'm flying home and I'm thinking,...

01:06.192 --> 01:09.317
"Well, we're trying to deliver condoms to people, or vaccinations".

01:09.867 --> 01:13.217
You know, Coke's success kinda stops and makes you wonder,...

01:13.633 --> 01:16.617
..."How is it that they can get Coke to these far-flung places?"

01:17.300 --> 01:21.850
And if they can do that, why can't governments and NGOs do the same thing?

01:22.300 --> 01:24.583
And I'm not the first person to ask this question.

01:25.133 --> 01:28.649
But I think as a community, we still have a lot to learn.
