00:00.200 --> 00:03.350
Let's work on forming the /ɝ/ sound.

00:04.150 --> 00:08.150
Make sure that your tongue is bunched and tense in the middle.

00:09.100 --> 00:14.450
Release the sound around the bunched portion and the slightly lifted front of the tongue.

00:15.300 --> 00:19.350
It should be held for a longer duration than the unstressed /ɝ/ sound,...

00:19.400 --> 00:24.200
...which occurs at the end of words like "father", "brother".

00:26.500 --> 00:30.250
/ɝ/, /ɝ/, /ɝ/.

00:31.350 --> 00:34.600
Here's /ɝ/ in the beginning of some words.

00:35.800 --> 00:40.800
Earth, Urgent, Irk.

00:42.700 --> 00:44.450
And here it is in the middle.

00:45.600 --> 00:50.400
Bird, Heard, Learning.

00:52.650 --> 00:55.100
Here it is at the end of some words.

00:56.400 --> 01:01.400
Fur, Purr, Sir.

01:05.350 --> 01:09.500
Listen to these pairs of words to hear the contrasting sounds.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.300
Earl, All.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.500
Birth, Bath.

01:18.750 --> 01:21.700
Purse, Pass.

01:24.700 --> 01:28.550
Here are some sentences that use the /ɝ/ sound.

01:29.750 --> 01:32.100
We heard the birds in the fir tree.

01:33.750 --> 01:36.800
Learning about the Earth is urgent.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.400
/ɝ/, /ɝ/, /ɝ/.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.350
Nice work!
