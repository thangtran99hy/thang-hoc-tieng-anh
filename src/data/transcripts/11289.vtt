Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:03.300 --> 00:04.750
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:05.050 --> 00:09.400
You know, English stuff, but I'm really tired today and I don't really feel like...

00:09.650 --> 00:10.100
You know what?

00:11.150 --> 00:11.850
Oh! Hi, Seita.

00:11.925 --> 00:12.150
What's up?

00:12.650 --> 00:13.000
What's up?

00:13.200 --> 00:18.000
I'm doing my show right now and I'm too tired to teach, so you need to do it.

00:18.450 --> 00:19.300
What? Are you serious?

00:19.550 --> 00:20.250
Alright, good night!

00:21.050 --> 00:27.950
Okay, alright. So, today's Maestro Hook is about self-introduction.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.300
I think a lot of Japanese people are not very good at self-introduction.

00:33.800 --> 00:38.050
So, I'm gonna show you a good example of introduction, okay?

00:38.800 --> 00:40.800
So, hi! This is Ikuyo.

00:41.100 --> 00:42.300
I'm from Tokyo.

00:42.800 --> 00:47.600
I like hanging out with my friends at cafes and I'm really into yoga right now.

00:48.000 --> 00:48.900
So yeah, like this.

01:06.450 --> 01:07.000
Show off.

01:09.100 --> 01:10.600
He's showing himself off.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.650
He's showing himself off.

01:20.700 --> 01:21.400
Stand out.

01:23.350 --> 01:24.450
She stands out.

01:24.900 --> 01:25.950
She stands out.

01:31.900 --> 01:33.650
So, Maestro Lines.

01:37.100 --> 01:41.050
Hey! He's trying to show his English off?

01:41.850 --> 01:46.900
Yeah, I think he wants everyone to know like, you know, his English is good.

01:51.800 --> 01:55.400
Look at that girl, you know, in a red dress.

01:55.700 --> 01:56.950
She really stands out.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.300
Oh, yeah. I think she's gonna go to a party tonight.

02:10.850 --> 02:16.800
I think that's it for today, but he's still sleeping.

02:18.250 --> 02:20.100
Seita! Seita! It's over!

02:21.750 --> 02:27.400
Alright. So, I hope you enjoyed this show.

02:27.800 --> 02:29.400
Bye-bye! See you next week!
