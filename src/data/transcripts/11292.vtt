00:00.249 --> 00:03.171
Let's work on forming the /oʊ/ sound.

00:03.890 --> 00:08.410
The tip of your tongue is relaxed and touching behind the lower front teeth.

00:09.277 --> 00:13.871
Move from the /o/ sound to the /ʊ/ sound quickly.

00:14.664 --> 00:21.827
/o/, /ʊ/, /o/, /ʊ/.

00:22.446 --> 00:28.588
You will find that you move from a more open position to a more closed position as you make the sound.

00:28.983 --> 00:31.347
Your lips are rounded for this sound.

00:32.623 --> 00:37.340
/oʊ/, /oʊ/, /oʊ/.

00:38.232 --> 00:41.650
Here's /oʊ/ in the beginning of some words.

00:42.285 --> 00:47.375
Open, Oh, Oak.

00:48.639 --> 00:50.943
And here it is in the middle.

00:51.799 --> 00:57.198
Cope, Zone, Flowing.

00:58.357 --> 01:01.341
And here it is at the end of some words.

01:01.674 --> 01:07.073
Flow, Know, Go.

01:08.137 --> 01:13.288
Listen to these pairs of words to hear the contrasting sounds.

01:14.134 --> 01:17.304
Oat, Out.

01:18.151 --> 01:21.506
Home, Ham.

01:22.379 --> 01:25.300
Toe, Toy.

01:26.889 --> 01:30.183
/oʊ/, /oʊ/, /oʊ/.
