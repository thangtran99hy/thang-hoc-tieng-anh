Let's work on forming the /eɪ/ sound.

The tip of your tongue is relaxed and touching behind your lower front teeth.

00:09.500 --> 00:13.300
This sound starts in the middle position on the front of the tongue.

00:14.200 --> 00:14.700
/ɛ/.

00:15.550 --> 00:19.800
From there, the front of the tongue lifts slightly, while the tip stays down.

00:20.550 --> 00:24.300
/ɪ/. /eɪ/, /eɪ/.

00:25.400 --> 00:28.250

00:31.000 --> 00:34.200
