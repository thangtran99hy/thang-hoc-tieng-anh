00:00.013 --> 00:02.579
Let's work on forming the /aʊ/ sound.

00:03.284 --> 00:07.578
The tip of your tongue is relaxed and touching behind the lower front teeth.

00:08.363 --> 00:16.001
Your tongue moves from front low /a/ to back high /ʊ/ in a very big movement.

00:16.760 --> 00:22.622
/aʊ/, /aʊ/, /aʊ/, /aʊ/, /aʊ/.

00:23.402 --> 00:25.096
Your jaw will move a lot too.

00:26.177 --> 00:33.340
The lips move from relaxed with the first vowel /a/, to rounded with the second vowel /ʊ/.

00:35.731 --> 00:39.396
/aʊ/, /aʊ/, /aʊ/.

00:40.765 --> 00:43.533
Here's the /aʊ/ sound in the beginning of some words.

00:44.541 --> 00:49.663
Owl, Ouch, Outside.

00:50.645 --> 00:52.795
And here it is in the middle.

00:53.467 --> 00:58.339
Sound, Mouse, Shout.

00:59.839 --> 01:01.947
Here it is at the end of some words.

01:02.667 --> 01:07.075
How, Now, Cow.

01:09.486 --> 01:13.739
Listen to these pairs of words to hear the contrasting sounds.

01:14.606 --> 01:17.249
Out, Ought.

01:18.814 --> 01:21.922
Bound, Band.

01:22.603 --> 01:25.866
Now, Know.

01:27.809 --> 01:32.527
Here are some sentences that use the /aʊ/ sound.

01:34.477 --> 01:37.151
The mouse came out just now.

01:39.156 --> 01:43.162
I heard a sound like a shout from outside.

01:45.357 --> 01:49.641
/aʊ/, /aʊ/, /aʊ/.
