00:00.011 --> 00:00.550
Who rejected you?

00:01.400 --> 00:03.600
Well, Stanford and Princeton, I think, rejected me.

00:03.675 --> 00:06.050
I think in Yale, I was waitlisted or something like that.

00:06.250 --> 00:07.900
I was rejected by Stanford and Princeton too.

00:08.000 --> 00:08.850
Okay, great!

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
I didn't even apply to Yale.

00:12.200 --> 00:12.600
Wow!

00:12.700 --> 00:13.050
Yeah!

00:13.150 --> 00:14.150
People think that's funny,...

00:14.200 --> 00:16.600
...it's like Yale or Harvard, the world's best colleges.

00:16.700 --> 00:19.550
So, if you get in to Harvard, obviously, you can get in to anywhere else.

00:19.950 --> 00:22.700
I met so many people that have been rejected from Stanford then got in to Harvard.

00:22.750 --> 00:25.375
Yeah. Well, Stanford, I don't know.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.650
Stanford has weird admissions policies.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.050
I think there's a bikini contest for getting into Stanford.

00:31.100 --> 00:33.500
But also, the application form, it's very hard to fill out,...

00:33.600 --> 00:36.100
...because it was in these categories like "What book would you like to publish?",...

00:36.200 --> 00:37.350
..."What music would you like to make?"

00:37.550 --> 00:37.850
Oh, Really?

00:38.200 --> 00:39.150
And it was very hard to fill out.

00:39.233 --> 00:40.708
Whereas the Harvard one was very open,...

00:40.795 --> 00:43.997
...so you actually gear it more towards what you wanted to say,...

00:44.500 --> 00:48.950
...and just in filling out the application, I find it so much easier,...

00:49.550 --> 00:52.100
...and that probably reflected it, you know?

00:52.550 --> 00:53.300
It worked out, apparently.

00:54.150 --> 00:57.600
Well, I don't know, I mean, I've got, you know, had a very warm,...

00:57.750 --> 01:00.100
...you know, pleasant college life instead of freezing in Boston.

01:00.350 --> 01:01.700
True, you could have had a tan.

01:02.150 --> 01:02.450
Yeah.

01:03.350 --> 01:05.850
So, you went to Harvard and then you went on to MIT?

01:05.900 --> 01:06.100
Yeah.

01:06.300 --> 01:09.350
And, you know, that sounds like a pretty normal progression.

01:09.900 --> 01:13.300
Well, actually, if you say it that way, it does,...

01:13.400 --> 01:14.000
...but actually, it wasn't...

01:14.100 --> 01:17.200
...because what happened was I went to Harvard, and then actually finished Harvard,...

01:17.250 --> 01:20.900
...and I came back to Japan, and joined a Japanese computer company, Fujitsu.

01:21.150 --> 01:21.400
Right.

01:21.500 --> 01:26.150
So, I actually started working as a kind of a salaryman researcher...

01:26.500 --> 01:29.000
...after having lived in the States from 13 to 22.
