Part of the beauty of playing improvised music is you never know what's gonna happen.

00:06.550 --> 00:08.650
You never know what's gonna happen in the moment.

00:09.267 --> 00:11.701
And as an audience member,...

00:11.931 --> 00:15.749
...I love to go see improvised music because I know that I'm part of the music.

00:16.407 --> 00:20.067
Meaning, musicians that play jazz or play bluegrass,...

00:20.178 --> 00:22.609
...or play music that is happening in the moment...

00:23.100 --> 00:25.950
...were also being influenced by the people in the room.

00:26.150 --> 00:31.150
So, we also can't help changing the way that we play because of who's there.

00:31.767 --> 00:34.919
So, of course, tomorrow if I do that song again,...

00:35.033 --> 00:37.759
...depending on the audience or the feeling in the room,...

00:37.800 --> 00:40.600
...or the day that I had or my mood, or whatever,...

00:41.200 --> 00:43.200
...the dinner or how my hair is.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.500
A different life is gonna come to the song.

00:47.650 --> 00:48.650
It's gonna be totally different.

00:48.700 --> 00:53.100
And so, Terri always gets mad at me because I always do the intro different, but it's because...

00:53.150 --> 00:53.950
How everything's a trial?

00:54.150 --> 00:55.400
Yeah, it always feels different.

00:55.500 --> 00:56.350
Everything feels different.

00:56.400 --> 01:02.150
But you know, that's one story that can mean a million different things on different days.

01:02.600 --> 01:05.591
So, sometimes when we tell that story,...

01:05.731 --> 01:08.259
...I think of one thing and then other times, I think of something else.

01:08.700 --> 01:10.950
And I think music should be like that, you know.
