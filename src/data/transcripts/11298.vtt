00:00.100 --> 00:02.950
When did you start to have this sense?

00:05.950 --> 00:10.200
I had written a book a few years ago called, in English, "A Whole New Mind".

00:10.250 --> 00:11.150
In Japanese,...

00:12.900 --> 00:20.900
And that book said we're moving from a world of these more logical, linear, routine abilities...

00:20.950 --> 00:25.900
...to a world of more creative, complex, conceptual, artistic abilities.

00:26.024 --> 00:30.556
And people ask me, "If this is right,..."

00:30.670 --> 00:33.511
"...then how do we motivate people to do this kind of work,"...

00:33.550 --> 00:34.700
...and I had no idea.

00:36.150 --> 00:43.750
But I did know that there was this large body of research in behavioral science about motivation,...

00:43.850 --> 00:44.800
...so I started looking at it.

00:45.350 --> 00:48.450
And I started reading some of these papers and I said, "Wow!"

00:48.650 --> 00:50.750
First of all, I realized there's a huge amount of research...

00:51.550 --> 00:55.350
...and then the other thing I said, "Wow! They're saying some very surprising things."

00:55.800 --> 01:00.200
They're saying the world works differently than the way that I think the world might work.

01:00.250 --> 01:01.700
This is really interesting, you know,...

01:02.150 --> 01:07.050
...and so, that's really how I started exploring this topic.

01:10.300 --> 01:15.350
And even in myself, in my own sort of personal story, you know,...

01:15.800 --> 01:18.500
...the description that you have of someone being in school...

01:18.800 --> 01:21.950
...doing things only for the external reward, that was me.

01:23.000 --> 01:23.450
That was you?

01:23.500 --> 01:27.100
Absolutely. When I was in secondary school...

01:28.200 --> 01:30.450
...really, sort of primary school and secondary school.

01:30.525 --> 01:34.550
A little bit less in university and beyond,...

01:35.050 --> 01:40.000
...but that was very much how I operated.

01:40.050 --> 01:41.250
I said, "That's the whole point."

01:41.350 --> 01:44.300
"The whole point is to get a good grade on a test."

01:46.900 --> 01:54.200
And as I got a little bit older, I started very gently questioning that in my head.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.250
Maybe in college and in university, yeah.

01:59.350 --> 02:03.600
And I started saying, "Well, maybe I should just do some things because I like doing them."

02:04.300 --> 02:08.350
And the weird thing was that I started, when I took that approach,...

02:09.350 --> 02:10.500
...I started doing better,...

02:12.200 --> 02:15.300
...you know, because I was interested in it and I was engaged.

02:17.250 --> 02:18.000
And motivated.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.450
Yeah, I was motivated. Right!

02:19.500 --> 02:24.650
I was motivated by something from within rather than something from the outside.
