00:00.400 --> 00:04.350
Now, we're gonna talk a little bit about what a consonant sound is.

00:05.050 --> 00:12.100
A consonant sound is some kind of interruption in the vocal stream that creates a sound.

00:12.500 --> 00:17.700
Sometimes it can be a very violent interruption like a /p/, /t/, /k/,...

00:18.500 --> 00:25.400
...or a softer interruption like /l/ or /m/, or /ʒ/,...

00:26.300 --> 00:34.400
In any case, some part of the articulators come together and create that interruption in the vocal stream.

00:35.050 --> 00:39.150
Your consonants are either going to be voiced or voiceless.

00:39.800 --> 00:44.550
In some cases, you'll have what we call consonant cognates or pairs.

00:44.850 --> 00:48.400
These pairs of sounds are made in exactly the same place,...

00:48.750 --> 00:50.950
...one is voiced and one is voiceless.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.850
An example of that would be your "TH" sound /θ/, /ð/.

00:56.350 --> 00:59.750
And there are many samples of that such as a /p/, /b/.

01:00.300 --> 01:06.750
Okay, and some are just a simple interruption and there's no voiceless version like /m/,...

01:07.250 --> 01:09.540
If there were a voiceless /m/, it would be like this...

01:10.900 --> 01:12.450
...doesn't really make any sense, does it?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.400
So, when you're working on your consonant sounds,...

01:15.600 --> 01:18.900
...just notice them and work on them in your practice sessions.
