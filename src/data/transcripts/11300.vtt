Now, we're gonna talk a little bit about vowel sounds...

00:03.900 --> 00:08.100
...and this information is applicable to every vowel sound you'll work with.

00:08.850 --> 00:16.250
A vowel sound is an uninterrupted stream of air or breath, in which the articulators do not move.

00:16.300 --> 00:19.300
That means there's no movement once you start the sound.

00:19.900 --> 00:21.250
And here's an example.

00:21.800 --> 00:27.050
/i/, /ɛ/, /ɒ/.

00:27.750 --> 00:32.000
Notice in each of those three voicings of /i/, /ɛ/, and /ɒ/,...

00:32.300 --> 00:35.650
...there was no movement of my mouth once the sound started.

00:36.500 --> 00:42.850
Now, there is one kind of vowel sound where there is movement and those are called diphthongs.

00:43.300 --> 00:50.450
A diphthong is when there's two vowel sounds that come together and the second sound is very quick and short.

00:50.650 --> 00:54.800
So, here are the examples of diphthongs in American English.

00:56.000 --> 01:04.100
/eɪ/, /aɪ/, /aʊ/, /ɔɪ/, /oʊ/.

01:04.950 --> 01:11.100
Notice that there is a flow of air, but a slight movement, and no movement of my tongue.

01:11.900 --> 01:18.000
For all of your vowel sounds, your tongue is relaxed and slightly touching the back of your lower front teeth.

01:18.500 --> 01:23.250
Keep this information in mind when you're practicing your individual vowel sounds.

01:23.550 --> 01:24.250
Good luck!
