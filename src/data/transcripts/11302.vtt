Hello, welcome to Michael's Business Top Tips!

00:03.600 --> 00:06.517
This month, we're looking at leadership versus management.

00:07.233 --> 00:08.050
What does this mean?

00:08.633 --> 00:11.850
An expert in this field is a gentleman called John Kotter...

00:12.167 --> 00:14.650
...who's a professor of leadership at Harvard Business School.

00:15.500 --> 00:18.917
He argues that management is focused very much on complexity,...

00:19.533 --> 00:25.403
...dealing with the complex daily routines such as budgeting, organizing, problem solving, etc.

00:26.067 --> 00:29.583
All very important, but not leadership.

00:30.300 --> 00:33.317
John Kotter says leadership is to deal with change,...

00:33.633 --> 00:37.950
...helping companies grow, develop, and move into new areas.

00:39.100 --> 00:42.517
He identifies four principles to being a successful leader.

00:43.299 --> 00:45.317
First, create vision and strategy.

00:46.233 --> 00:50.783
A leader has a clear vision of where they want to go to and their company to go to,...

00:51.300 --> 00:54.850
...and strategy sets the map how to get there.

00:56.133 --> 00:59.017
Second, communicate and set direction.

00:59.867 --> 01:02.117
A good leader needs to be a good communicator.

01:02.900 --> 01:06.317
They need to communicate their vision clearly to the people they work with...

01:06.667 --> 01:10.150
...and also set a clear direction for everybody to move forward.

01:11.433 --> 01:13.217
Third, motivate action.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.650
Here, emotion is key.

01:16.300 --> 01:19.865
A good leader should be using persuasive skills,...

01:20.053 --> 01:24.317
...inspiring, praising, recognizing the work of others,...

01:24.567 --> 01:27.783
...to encourage them and motivate them to successful action.

01:28.967 --> 01:30.517
Finally, align people.

01:31.133 --> 01:35.250
A good leader needs to make sure everybody is working in the same direction.

01:35.867 --> 01:37.917
Everybody is aiming at the same goals.

01:38.300 --> 01:40.617
This is key to success of achieving the vision.

01:42.067 --> 01:45.050
Now remember, anybody can be a leader.

01:45.700 --> 01:47.683
It doesn't have to be a manager to be a leader.

01:48.333 --> 01:51.850
So, use these four principles to become a leader yourself.

01:52.933 --> 01:54.150
Thank you and good luck!
