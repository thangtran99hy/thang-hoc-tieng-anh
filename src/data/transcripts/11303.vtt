Welcome to AERA English's Native Maestro.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.050
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:04.450 --> 00:07.350
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:07.850 --> 00:09.450
Okay, today's Maestro Hook.

00:09.850 --> 00:13.800
Now, Maestro Hook is a good conversation piece you can use with a foreigner when you're speaking.

00:14.300 --> 00:18.350
Today's Hook is about getting picked up and meeting someone special.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.850
A lot of foreigner girls I know say they've never been picked up in Japan.

00:24.400 --> 00:27.550
You know, even if they're beautiful and they're sitting in a bar by themselves,...

00:27.650 --> 00:31.800
...no one picks them up because Japanese guys are scared to talk to a foreigner girl...

00:31.850 --> 00:33.200
...because they don't speak English.

00:33.767 --> 00:34.904
Now, in a situation like that,...

00:34.977 --> 00:38.653
...I have two perfect lines you can use to pick up a foreigner girl, okay?

00:47.650 --> 00:48.300
You from around here?

00:49.300 --> 00:50.050
You from around here?

01:14.450 --> 01:15.550
Thought I saw an angel.

01:16.350 --> 01:17.400
Thought I saw an angel.

01:29.300 --> 01:31.150
So, Maestro Lines.

01:36.150 --> 01:37.900
Hey, you from around here?

01:38.450 --> 01:39.400
I haven't seen you before.

01:40.750 --> 01:42.200
Oh no, I just came to Tokyo.

01:43.350 --> 01:44.500
Why don't I show you around?

01:48.750 --> 01:51.000
Excuse me. Oh! I thought I saw an angel.

01:53.100 --> 01:55.050
No, just kidding, but are you from around here?

01:58.600 --> 02:03.200
So, if you wanna pick up girls, foreigners, and you wanna speak good English,...

02:03.400 --> 02:06.050
...please use these lines and practice, okay?

02:06.600 --> 02:08.050
Thanks a lot and I'll see you again...

02:08.250 --> 02:10.600
...and, please watch again on Native Maestro. Bye-bye!
