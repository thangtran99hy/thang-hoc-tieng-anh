00:04.850 --> 00:08.800
Italy, 15th century,...

00:11.200 --> 00:12.600
...the age of Renaissance.

00:15.300 --> 00:18.300
A time considered to be the rebirth of man.

00:21.300 --> 00:26.250
Yet behind humanity's expanding consciousness, a movement was taking place.

00:28.100 --> 00:34.050
A conspiracy by one corrupt family to overthrow the powerful Medici dynasty...

00:36.900 --> 00:39.150
...and destroy a unified Italy.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.250
But, there were still some who fought for justice,...

00:47.200 --> 00:49.200
...and followed an ancient creed.

00:54.600 --> 00:57.350
And it is with them that our story begins.
