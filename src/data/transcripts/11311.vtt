00:00.200 --> 00:04.050
In the rainy season, there is food about if you know where to look.

00:05.450 --> 00:06.450
Dead acacia tree.

00:08.100 --> 00:12.800
What the locals will always do with this is to come up and put their ear to it,...

00:13.700 --> 00:15.950
...and listen for larva inside.

00:22.550 --> 00:23.950
Here you go. That's what I mean.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.200
It's a rhino beetle larva.

00:30.450 --> 00:32.800
You can just eat them, even raw.

00:34.550 --> 00:36.700
When they're cooked, they are a bush delicacy.

00:36.950 --> 00:39.150
And at this time of year, there's plenty of them here.

00:40.650 --> 00:42.000
No wonder they fry them.

00:46.350 --> 00:48.750
Oh! Ready for this?

00:54.800 --> 00:56.100
Oh my goodness!

00:59.800 --> 01:04.950
This one has been living in there for a very, very long time.

01:08.100 --> 01:10.250
I'm not gonna need to eat for a week after this one.

01:22.400 --> 01:27.250
Pound for pound, insects like these contain more protein than beef or fish.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.250
They're perfect survival food.

01:31.500 --> 01:38.200
It actually ranks as one of the worst things I have ever, ever eaten.

01:46.650 --> 01:53.500
I tell you, it's like if all your friends got all their bogies together,...

01:54.550 --> 01:56.650
...squeezed them inside a sausage,...

01:58.650 --> 02:00.350
...and then you put that into your mouth, man!
