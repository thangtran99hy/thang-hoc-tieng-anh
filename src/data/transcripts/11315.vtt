Welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro!

00:03.100 --> 00:04.200
I'm your maitre d' Seita.

00:04.550 --> 00:07.550
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.400
Now, today's Maestro Hook is a good conversation piece that you can use with a foreigner.

00:12.850 --> 00:16.750
Now, today's Hook is about using animals as a reference when you're speaking in English...

00:17.100 --> 00:18.300
...especially in terms of idioms.

00:18.950 --> 00:24.525
Now, there're a lot of idioms that use animals, but there are some that are very old we never use.

00:24.575 --> 00:28.100
For example, a lot of Japanese people know "It's raining cats and dogs",...

00:28.450 --> 00:30.300
...but my grandmother doesn't even use that.

00:30.400 --> 00:31.300
It's so old.

00:31.850 --> 00:32.850
So, please don't use it.

00:33.400 --> 00:37.300
On the other hand, a joke like, "Why did the chicken cross the road?", is always good.

00:38.050 --> 00:40.200
So, there're a lot of animal phrases that we use...

00:40.400 --> 00:44.200
...and some are good, some are not. So, let's check out some that you can really actually use.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.900
It's a wild-goose chase.

01:02.900 --> 01:03.800
Wild-goose chase.

01:14.550 --> 01:15.300
Wild-goose chase.

01:20.300 --> 01:21.300
Wild-goose chase.

01:28.350 --> 01:31.600
It's a crocodile.

01:33.500 --> 01:34.600
It's a crocodile tear.

01:35.850 --> 01:36.600
Crocodile tear.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.400
Oh! It's a crocodile tear.

01:48.150 --> 01:52.200
Okay. So, two lines and today's Maestro Lines.

01:55.600 --> 02:01.400
Oh! It's a wild-goose chase; I went all over the town, but I couldn't find what I wanted to find.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.050
Ah! It was a wild-goose chase.

02:07.250 --> 02:10.200
She was crying, but I bet it's a crocodile tear.

02:11.050 --> 02:12.350
I bet it's a crocodile tear.

02:14.750 --> 02:16.850
Okay. So, that's it for today.

02:17.100 --> 02:20.300
A lot of animal English and use the ones that are pretty fresh, okay?

02:20.750 --> 02:22.550
And I'll see you later, and hope to catch you again!

02:22.650 --> 02:24.500
Now, see you later on Native Maestro.

02:24.650 --> 02:25.000
Bye-bye!
