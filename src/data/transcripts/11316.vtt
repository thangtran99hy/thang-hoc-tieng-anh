The only problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste.

00:03.965 --> 00:08.665
They have absolutely no taste and what that means is that I don't mean that in a small way.

00:08.749 --> 00:09.475
I mean that in a big way.

00:10.029 --> 00:10.945
In the sense that...

00:18.166 --> 00:23.691
...they don't think of original ideas and they don't bring much culture into their product.

00:25.041 --> 00:26.583
And, you say "Why is that important?"

00:26.657 --> 00:30.716
Well, you know, proportionally spaced fonts come from typesetting and beautiful books.

00:30.787 --> 00:32.065
That's where one gets the idea.

00:32.577 --> 00:35.105
If it weren't for the Mac, they would never have that in their products.

00:37.688 --> 00:44.351
And so, I guess, I am saddened not by Microsoft's success.

00:44.453 --> 00:46.117
I have no problem with their success.

00:46.656 --> 00:49.679
They've earned their success for the most part.

00:50.207 --> 00:53.882
I have a problem with the fact that they just make really third-rate products.
