00:01.194 --> 00:01.830
What should I do?

00:03.541 --> 00:05.129
Should I admit that I've made mistakes?

00:06.177 --> 00:07.797
Should I remind you that I've done this before?

00:08.100 --> 00:09.522
Should I give you a history lesson?

00:10.150 --> 00:10.847
What should I do?

00:11.747 --> 00:13.173
Should I tell you how much fun we had?

00:16.473 --> 00:19.456
So, this went well.

00:20.164 --> 00:22.010
Should I really believe I ruined my legacy?

00:23.243 --> 00:24.005
What should I do?

00:24.099 --> 00:24.718
What should I do?

00:24.791 --> 00:25.349
What should I do?

00:25.399 --> 00:26.972
Should I have my tattoo removed?

00:27.071 --> 00:28.356
Wanna see my shiny new shoes?

00:28.395 --> 00:29.091
Should I just sell shoes?

00:29.285 --> 00:30.116
Shiny new shoes.

00:31.112 --> 00:33.097
Or should I tell you, "I am not a role model"?

00:34.565 --> 00:34.929
Hi, Chuck!

00:35.454 --> 00:36.545
Seriously, what should I do?

00:36.606 --> 00:39.165
Should I tell you I'm a championship chaser who did it for the money, rings?

00:39.127 --> 00:40.407
Should I be who you want me to be?

00:40.725 --> 00:43.107
Should I accept my role as a villain?

00:43.414 --> 00:44.931
Maybe, I should just disappear.

00:48.122 --> 00:49.497
Should I stop listening to my friends?

00:49.778 --> 00:50.660
They're my friends.

00:50.834 --> 00:51.907
Should I try acting?

00:52.785 --> 00:54.333
You just gotta deal with the heat, man.

00:55.923 --> 00:56.629
Be patient.

00:56.881 --> 01:00.327
After a while, the temperature drops and everything is free and easy.

01:00.467 --> 01:01.387
Should I be writing this down?

01:02.071 --> 01:02.482
Uh-huh.

01:02.635 --> 01:03.360
Should I make you laugh?

01:03.422 --> 01:04.713
Should I read you a soulful poem?

01:04.799 --> 01:08.769
Shoot me with your words, you may cut me with your eyes, but still, like air,...

01:09.208 --> 01:10.001
...I'll rise.

01:10.381 --> 01:12.500
Or should we just clear the decks and start over?

01:12.715 --> 01:13.569
Coming through here.

01:15.960 --> 01:16.800
What should I do?

01:21.260 --> 01:22.805
Should I be who you want me to be?
