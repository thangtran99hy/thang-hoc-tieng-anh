00:01.800 --> 00:04.050
200 years ago, he was born.

00:04.800 --> 00:09.250
He wanted to know how the whole of the natural world interconnected.

00:10.200 --> 00:13.050
He wanted to know how continents emerged,...

00:13.250 --> 00:15.250
...how ocean basins formed.

00:15.650 --> 00:19.200
He wanted to know how life evolved.

00:21.300 --> 00:24.350
150 years ago, it was published.

00:25.000 --> 00:32.200
It's transformed the way that Western cultures have regarded the Divine in the natural world.

00:33.800 --> 00:38.400
One man on one voyage changed the way we see ourselves.

00:39.450 --> 00:42.950
He dared to question the need for a supernatural creator.

00:44.300 --> 00:49.750
But what drove him to explore a new explanation for the existence of all living things...

00:50.650 --> 00:53.300
...and why was it so controversial?

00:54.200 --> 00:56.250
I've studied Darwin all my life...

00:56.800 --> 01:01.950
...and behind that great, big beard, he still remains an enigma.

01:06.600 --> 01:10.000
150 years later, we explore this enigma...

01:10.950 --> 01:15.500
...examining the ideas of Charles Darwin in the light of today's knowledge.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.800
Do they still have relevance?

01:18.500 --> 01:20.750
Does his science still make sense?

01:21.950 --> 01:29.400
We embark on a journey of understanding where we revisit the voyage that shook the world.
