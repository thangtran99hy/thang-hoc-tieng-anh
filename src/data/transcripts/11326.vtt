00:00.350 --> 00:04.650
I'm really excited by our next, very modern, very now, Guinness World Record attempt.

00:04.750 --> 00:08.250
It's the fastest text message ever sent.

00:08.650 --> 00:14.950
And here to try and get this hotly contested record back is former world record holder, James Trusler.

00:17.550 --> 00:20.550
And James has been flown in from Fiji by his employer, Vodafone.

00:20.700 --> 00:24.650
Now James, when did you hold the record and who has it now?

00:24.900 --> 00:28.650
Okay. Yeah, Grant. I've initially broke it in April 2003...

00:28.850 --> 00:33.800
...and I had it up until about probably six months ago by Kimberly Yale from Singapore.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.200
She's now holding the record.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.350
You're a self-confessed textaholic.

00:37.450 --> 00:38.500
How many do you send a month?

00:38.600 --> 00:41.250
Probably about 2,000 a month, but I can peak to about 4,000.

00:41.950 --> 00:43.150
Peak to 4,000 a month?

00:43.250 --> 00:43.850
At one stage, yeah.

00:44.000 --> 00:44.650
Holy smokes!

00:44.833 --> 00:47.999
Okay. Now, before I actually bring Official Adjudicator Chris Sheedy in...

00:48.081 --> 00:50.101
...to explain the finer points of this record attempt,...

00:50.600 --> 00:54.250
...have a look now on your screen at the text that James must type.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.750
The razor-toothed piranhas of the genera Serrasalmus and the Pygocentrus...

01:01.050 --> 01:04.000
...are the most ferocious freshwater fish in the world.

01:04.050 --> 01:07.100
But in reality, they seldom attack a human.

01:07.450 --> 01:10.000
That's a mouthful to say. What's it like to type?

01:10.150 --> 01:11.550
It's not gonna be easy.

01:11.750 --> 01:13.450
We've got a couple of uppercases in there.

01:13.900 --> 01:17.100
There's a hyphen, some four stops, and some tough words.

01:17.150 --> 01:18.100
They've got everything in there.

01:18.250 --> 01:19.600
Are you faster than you've ever been?

01:20.300 --> 01:21.560
Let's hope it goes my way tonight.

01:21.650 --> 01:26.900
Okay. We will let you warm up those little texting tykes now as we have a quick chat to Chris Sheedy.

01:27.000 --> 01:27.600
Come on in Chris!

01:27.650 --> 01:28.700
Thank you very much, Grant.

01:29.600 --> 01:33.200
"The Battle of Texting Titans" continues. What are the rules?

01:33.467 --> 01:34.796
What we're gonna make sure is first of all,...

01:34.895 --> 01:37.255
...James is using a commercially available telephone...

01:37.550 --> 01:41.200
...and all of the predictive spelling functionality is completely switched off.

01:41.250 --> 01:42.250
No predictive texting?

01:42.400 --> 01:43.000
None at all.

01:43.700 --> 01:48.950
Then, he simply needs to type in the text we just saw as quickly as possible with no mistakes whatsoever.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.500
So, all punctuation and spelling must be absolutely correct.

01:51.550 --> 01:53.300
Okay. So, if you don't know what predictive texting is,...

01:53.350 --> 01:55.450
...it's the one where it spells the word out in advance.

01:55.700 --> 01:59.800
You've got to punch in every single letter, number, space.

02:01.500 --> 02:02.200
You feeling up to it?

02:02.450 --> 02:03.350
I'm definitely up for it.

02:03.600 --> 02:04.200
Okey-dokey.

02:04.350 --> 02:06.350
Well, this record belongs to another country.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.950
You've earned it twice before. Will it be a trifecta?

02:09.450 --> 02:11.050
James, we'll stand back and you get ready.

02:11.250 --> 02:11.950
Okay, let's go!

02:12.150 --> 02:12.900
Best of luck, James!

02:12.950 --> 02:13.300
Thanks!

02:13.350 --> 02:15.800
Three, two, one. Go!

02:22.750 --> 02:25.750
26 words, 160 characters.

02:26.550 --> 02:30.350
The record he's aiming for is under 43.2 seconds.

02:34.100 --> 02:35.900
Four characters a second he needs.

02:36.650 --> 02:38.300
He's been texting for nine years,...

02:39.000 --> 02:40.800
...sends up to 4,000 a month.

03:06.400 --> 03:06.700
Stop.

03:07.100 --> 03:12.050
Well, he had to get those 26 words out in under 43.2 seconds...

03:12.250 --> 03:15.550
...and unfortunately, it still stands. That was 51.3 seconds.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.050
So close, so close.
