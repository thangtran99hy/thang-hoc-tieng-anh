00:01.000 --> 00:02.200
So lady says, "Would I?"...

00:02.700 --> 00:04.200
...and then the guy says, "You hunchback!"

00:06.050 --> 00:07.000
Alright, that's it.

00:07.650 --> 00:10.100
So, welcome to AERA English TV's Native Maestro.

00:10.150 --> 00:11.300
I'm your maitre d', Seita.

00:11.400 --> 00:14.250
And this program is designed to help you become the native maestro.

00:14.750 --> 00:17.700
So, today's Maestro Hook is an American joke.

00:18.050 --> 00:18.950
So, here it goes.

00:19.750 --> 00:23.500
Three men die and they go to heaven. And then God says to the three men,...

00:23.850 --> 00:27.250
..."Depending on how faithful you were to your wife, you're gonna get a good car."

00:27.600 --> 00:30.900
So, to the first guy, "You've never cheated on your wife; you're a great guy,...

00:31.200 --> 00:32.400
...I'm gonna give you a Ferrari."

00:33.100 --> 00:36.050
Second guy, "You know, you cheated on your wife once,...

00:36.200 --> 00:38.700
...so, you know what, what the hell, I'm gonna give you a Lexus."

00:39.500 --> 00:42.500
And the third guy, "Oh you cheated on your wife like five times."

00:42.800 --> 00:44.300
"All you get is a Honda Civic."

00:45.100 --> 00:47.800
But, the guy with the Ferrari is really not that happy.

00:48.400 --> 00:51.300
And everybody says, "How come you're not happy, you got yourself a Ferrari?"

00:51.800 --> 00:56.200
And then he says, "Well, my wife died with me too, but I just saw her in roller skates."

00:57.800 --> 00:59.300
Yup, that's a good joke.

00:59.550 --> 01:00.300
Oh my God!

01:00.600 --> 01:02.450
Alright, so today's Maestro Menu.

01:09.950 --> 01:10.750
That's a good one.

01:14.550 --> 01:15.900
Oh, that's a good one.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.200
And the second one.

01:25.450 --> 01:26.450
Where's the punch line?

01:33.100 --> 01:33.825
Where's the punch line?

01:39.050 --> 01:40.450
So, Maestro Lines.

01:42.850 --> 01:44.000
Oh, that's a good one!

01:44.550 --> 01:45.550
Yeah, it was really funny.

01:53.900 --> 01:54.900
Where's the punch line?

01:58.400 --> 02:00.550
Alright, that's it for today. Hope you enjoyed it.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.300
And see you again on Native Maestro.

02:02.550 --> 02:02.950
Bye-bye!
