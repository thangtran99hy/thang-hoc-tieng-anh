00:00.799 --> 00:03.911
They bring their djembes, their congas and their shakers.

00:04.409 --> 00:05.847
Rhythms build and fade.

00:06.487 --> 00:08.112
Strangers get up to dance.

00:08.715 --> 00:09.844
Crowds gather around.

00:10.933 --> 00:14.298
You can find them each Sunday in Meridian Hill Park in Washington.

00:14.627 --> 00:19.703
It is this circle, the drum circle, that draws them as it has for nearly 50 years...

00:19.805 --> 00:22.448
...when several African-American drummers first gathered.

00:24.267 --> 00:26.304
Willy Posey is one of the originals.

00:26.718 --> 00:29.820
A few guys gathered together, they just started the circle...

00:30.426 --> 00:33.964
...and it just grows, grows, grows, more and more and more over the years.

00:35.217 --> 00:39.512
Abdel Elgizouzi has been coming with his family since moving here from Sudan.

00:39.939 --> 00:47.057
12 years ago, there was a group of about 10, 15 black old males playing.

00:47.287 --> 00:51.365
Now you see, there are almost 150 drummers.

00:52.767 --> 00:55.903
The circle reflects the shifting demographics in Washington.

00:56.233 --> 01:00.710
The US Census Bureau shows that the city's predominantly African-American population...

01:01.019 --> 01:03.572
...has declined five percent since 2000,...

01:04.021 --> 01:08.281
...while the number of whites, Asians and Hispanics has increased 22 percent.

01:10.384 --> 01:14.336
Kevin Lambert says he was the first white person to start playing at the circle.

01:14.603 --> 01:17.093
Several people stopped the drumming when I would show up and say,...

01:17.194 --> 01:18.504
..."You can't play with this white boy."

01:19.143 --> 01:23.445
And this went on for a while and the leader of this finally said,...

01:24.006 --> 01:25.547
..."You cannot pull any racism in this.

01:25.641 --> 01:26.462
This is about music.
