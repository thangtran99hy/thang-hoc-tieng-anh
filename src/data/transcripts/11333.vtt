00:00.250 --> 00:02.550
Mary was not at all pleased with her new home.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.350
She was not used to servants talking to her as if they were the same.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.650
"Where is my maid?", Mary asked.

00:10.350 --> 00:12.600
"In India, I had my own maid."

00:13.250 --> 00:16.300
"You won't have one here", Martha said.

00:16.650 --> 00:19.000
With these words, Martha left Mary alone.

00:19.500 --> 00:23.800
There was nothing for Mary to do in the house. So every day, she walked in the gardens.

00:24.350 --> 00:27.200
One day, she walked around the wall without a door.

00:27.950 --> 00:29.600
Suddenly, she heard a bird singing.

00:30.350 --> 00:33.150
Mary asked the bird, "Will you be my friend?"

00:33.750 --> 00:36.350
The bird flew toward a tree and sat on a branch.

00:36.650 --> 00:37.500
It began to sing.

00:38.350 --> 00:41.700
"You live in that garden, don't you?", she said.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.950
"But no one can go in because there isn't a door."

00:45.400 --> 00:47.600
"I want to know what's behind this wall."

00:48.450 --> 00:50.600
The robin trusted her and did not fly away.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.450
It began pecking at the ground, looking for a worm to eat.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.100
Mary looked closely at the ground.

00:57.850 --> 00:59.700
She saw something that looked like metal.

01:00.350 --> 01:02.750
She cleaned it and saw that it was a key.

01:03.250 --> 01:05.650
Mary stopped skipping and spoke to the robin.

01:06.050 --> 01:07.800
"Can you show me where the door is?"

01:08.200 --> 01:10.900
The robin sat on the top of the garden wall.

01:11.350 --> 01:12.250
It began to sing.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.700
Mary pulled at a piece of the ivy.

01:15.500 --> 01:16.700
It came away from the wall.

01:17.700 --> 01:19.000
Behind the wall was a door.

01:19.750 --> 01:22.100
Mary put the key in the lock of the door and turned it.

01:22.950 --> 01:26.300
Only seconds later, Mary was inside the secret garden.
