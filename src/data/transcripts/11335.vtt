My name is Dr. Watson. And for many years, I was a good friend of the famous detective Sherlock Holmes.

00:06.770 --> 00:10.670
Holmes and I were eating breakfast when suddenly, Holmes said to me,...

00:11.170 --> 00:14.120
..."I have to go to a place called King's Pyland."

00:14.580 --> 00:18.210
"A horse has disappeared from there and the police can't find it."

00:18.650 --> 00:21.880
"Why is this horse so important, Holmes?", I asked.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.260
"Because Watson,",...

00:23.360 --> 00:24.300
...Holmes explained,...

00:24.480 --> 00:27.590
..."it is going to run in a big race called the Wessex Cup."

00:27.890 --> 00:32.730
"If it wins, a lot of people who have bet large sums of money on it will win a great deal."

00:33.090 --> 00:35.500
"There are also people who don't want it to win."

00:35.800 --> 00:37.670
Holmes paused, and then he said,...

00:37.870 --> 00:42.140
..."Watson, did you read in the newspaper about John Straker being murdered?"

00:42.340 --> 00:44.810
"Yes, most newspapers reported the murder."

00:45.010 --> 00:49.610
"Well Watson, John Straker was the man who was responsible for looking after the horse,...

00:49.880 --> 00:51.680
...training, and exercising it."

00:52.020 --> 00:56.050
We left the house and went to where the body of John Straker had been found.

00:56.650 --> 00:59.660
Suddenly, Colonel Ross whispered something in my ear.

01:00.320 --> 01:03.060
"Why is Mr. Holmes on his hands and knees?",...

01:03.160 --> 01:03.790
...he asked.

01:04.190 --> 01:06.590
Before I could reply, Holmes exclaimed,...

01:06.830 --> 01:08.600
..."Hello! What's this?"

01:08.900 --> 01:10.900
He held up a tiny piece of wood.

01:11.100 --> 01:14.110
"It's a match, half-burned here in the mud.",...

01:14.300 --> 01:15.200
...Holmes answered.

01:15.500 --> 01:18.040
"I must have missed it, Mr. Holmes. I'm sorry.",...

01:18.280 --> 01:19.810
...the inspector apologized.

01:19.910 --> 01:23.010
"Don't feel bad. I was actually looking for it.",...

01:23.110 --> 01:24.080
...Holmes told him.

01:24.380 --> 01:26.020
"You expected to find a match?",...

01:26.350 --> 01:28.520
...the inspector asked, very surprised.

01:28.850 --> 01:31.020
Holmes gave me one of his thin smiles.

01:31.190 --> 01:31.920
"Yes.",...

01:32.190 --> 01:32.720
...he said.

01:32.820 --> 01:37.330
"You know, Watson, being a detective is like playing the best game in the world."

01:37.730 --> 01:42.430
"It's an occupation full of surprises and this game has just started."
