00:01.800 --> 00:05.140
At sea, thousands of miles from any land,...

00:05.300 --> 00:07.700
...the vastness of the ocean is giving way...

00:08.510 --> 00:12.640
...to what some say is the largest garbage dump in the world.

00:13.110 --> 00:16.950
Bottle caps, soap bottles, shards of plastic.

00:18.700 --> 00:21.520
It's called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

00:21.750 --> 00:24.650
It's mostly plastic which doesn't biodegrade.

00:24.920 --> 00:28.260
It just crumbles down into smaller and smaller pieces.

00:28.540 --> 00:32.090
The patch now spreads across millions of square miles in the Pacific ocean.

00:32.930 --> 00:35.400
How far does it extend? It can't be too large.

00:35.500 --> 00:41.380
As a matter of fact, it extends from just off the coast of California all the way to China.

00:41.480 --> 00:43.910
It's bigger than the continental United States.

00:44.040 --> 00:49.750
Charles Moore made the shocking discovery in 1997 by accident while sailing the Pacific.

00:50.010 --> 00:53.620
He's been collecting samples of the growing Garbage Patch ever since.

00:53.980 --> 00:58.050
Some samples contain six times more plastic than plankton.

00:59.520 --> 01:02.860
It's been described almost like a trash soup.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.630
It's like a minestrone that's out there...

01:05.830 --> 01:08.900
...and all the little vegetables are different colored bits of plastic.

01:09.060 --> 01:12.740
The Garbage Patch is caused by a series of currents in the Pacific ocean,...

01:13.000 --> 01:16.070
...pooling what we all throw away.

01:16.380 --> 01:20.380
The currents create a circular effect, pulling debris from North America,...

01:20.580 --> 01:25.950
...Asia, and the Hawaiian Islands; and shooting it all into a graveyard of trash.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.780
3.5 million tons of it.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.950
80% is plastic and it doesn't decompose.

01:32.150 --> 01:35.550
It stays as little plastic pieces for decades.
