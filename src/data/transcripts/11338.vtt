00:00.950 --> 00:04.200
More than five million people die each year from smoking,...

00:05.600 --> 00:07.600
...many of them in developing countries.

00:08.000 --> 00:14.250
And Dr. Thomas Frieden says fewer than ten percent of the world's nations are doing enough to prevent it.

00:14.800 --> 00:19.400
The head of the Centers for Disease Control points to the United States and Uruguay...

00:19.800 --> 00:23.150
...as countries whose anti-tobacco programs have worked.

00:23.550 --> 00:26.550
He says other countries should follow their example.

00:26.950 --> 00:30.300
Tobacco is now the world's leading, single cause of death...

00:30.350 --> 00:33.900
...that kills more people than AIDS, TB, and malaria combined.

00:34.150 --> 00:36.600
And unlike those conditions which are decreasing,...

00:37.200 --> 00:39.000
...it is increasing as a cause of death.

00:39.400 --> 00:43.900
But smoking is only one of the world's major problems, Dr. Frieden said,...

00:44.300 --> 00:48.300
...pointing out that traffic accident deaths are becoming an epidemic.

00:48.800 --> 00:52.750
More than one million people are killed in traffic each year, he said,...

00:53.150 --> 00:56.400
...including people who are walking or riding bikes.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.600
What will happen over the next 25, 20 years...

00:59.950 --> 01:02.950
...unless we take urgent action, is that road traffic injuries...

01:03.200 --> 01:08.700
...will increase from two percent of all deaths, to three and a half percent of all deaths.

01:08.750 --> 01:12.950
They will become the 5th leading cause of death around the world.

01:13.300 --> 01:20.050
Dr. Frieden says respiratory infections such as tuberculosis, continue to be another key problem.

01:20.450 --> 01:24.300
He says one billion people do not have access to clean water...

01:24.800 --> 01:28.400
...and two and a half billion do not have adequate sanitation.

01:29.100 --> 01:33.500
He says better access to both would prevent the deaths of millions of people,...

01:33.900 --> 01:37.300
...including children who die from diarrheal disease.

01:37.700 --> 01:40.250
We have cholera still in many parts of the world.

01:40.650 --> 01:45.650
A reflection of the failure to provide clean water and adequate sanitation.
