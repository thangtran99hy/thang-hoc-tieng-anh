00:02.900 --> 00:05.270
There once lived a very large whale.

00:05.570 --> 00:08.000
This whale was always very hungry.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.170
He liked eating fish.

00:10.540 --> 00:16.040
He ate, and ate, and ate until there was only one fish left in the sea.

00:16.680 --> 00:18.450
This fish was very clever.

00:18.820 --> 00:24.990
He hid behind the whale's ear and said in a soft voice, "Have you ever eaten a man?"

00:25.790 --> 00:28.260
"No, I haven't," the whale answered.

00:28.590 --> 00:32.800
"You should try one," the fish suggested. "I'm sure you'll enjoy it."

00:33.600 --> 00:36.270
"Where can I find a man?" the whale asked.

00:36.770 --> 00:40.340
"There's one sitting alone on a boat," the fish answered.

00:40.700 --> 00:45.210
"He's a sailor. His ship sank and he lives on an island."

00:45.710 --> 00:47.740
"Follow me, I'll take you to it."

00:48.440 --> 00:51.080
The fish swam away and the whale followed it.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.450
Soon, they came to an island.

00:54.280 --> 00:58.320
"Can you see the man?" the fish asked. "He's sitting in his boat."

00:58.920 --> 01:01.490
"Yes, I can see him," the whale said.

01:01.920 --> 01:06.190
As quickly as he could, the whale swam toward the man in his boat.

01:06.500 --> 01:10.470
He opened his big mouth, and swallowed the man, and his boat.

01:11.170 --> 01:15.300
When the man found himself inside the whale, he was very angry.

01:15.670 --> 01:19.480
He jumped up, and down, and shouted for the whale to let him go.

01:20.010 --> 01:24.450
He ran around, and around inside the whale. He was very upset.

01:25.610 --> 01:28.080
All these movements made the whale hiccup.

01:28.820 --> 01:30.750
The small fish saw all of this.
