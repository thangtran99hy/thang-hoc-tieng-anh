00:00.200 --> 00:00.700
Hi, I'm Patrick.

00:00.825 --> 00:02.100
Hi, my name is Ai.

00:02.350 --> 00:03.100
Nice to meet you.

00:03.700 --> 00:08.052
We've never done this before on tape, to have the self-introduction important part,...

00:08.154 --> 00:10.223
...but give me your standard self-introduction.

00:11.600 --> 00:12.600
Self-introduction.

00:12.700 --> 00:13.000
Yes.

00:14.250 --> 00:15.500
My name is Ai Sugiyama.

00:16.100 --> 00:21.500
And I turned pro when I was 17.

00:21.800 --> 00:25.050
I've been a professional tennis player for 17 years,...

00:25.700 --> 00:30.750
...and I have retired my career last year, October 2009.

00:31.400 --> 00:31.650
Great.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.200
And it's been a year.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.050
And what are you doing with your free time now?

00:35.900 --> 00:36.900
Right now, free time?

00:37.200 --> 00:37.350
Yeah.

00:38.300 --> 00:43.200
Well, actually my parents gave me a dog, the puppy French bulldog.

00:43.800 --> 00:48.650
So, he's my buddy and when I have free time, I'm playing around with him.

00:50.200 --> 00:53.550
And also, I have so much time spending with my friends.

00:53.600 --> 00:58.200
So now, I climbed Mount Fuji this summer.

00:58.500 --> 00:59.550
Hey! Congratulations.

00:59.600 --> 01:00.300
Thank you very much.

01:00.350 --> 01:02.500
So, it's like you have a whole other life starting up.

01:02.700 --> 01:04.200
Yes, a totally different life.

01:04.600 --> 01:05.050
That's great.

01:05.200 --> 01:05.500
Yeah.

01:06.150 --> 01:14.150
And is it as exciting, not quite as exciting, not nearly as exciting, much more boring,...

01:14.250 --> 01:16.200
...how does it compare to your life as a tennis pro?

01:16.350 --> 01:17.700
It's totally different.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.300
Such a, how do you say? Well, a really totally different lifestyle.

01:23.850 --> 01:29.800
Because first thing when I wake up in the morning, I have pain and aches.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.300
Every morning when I wake up, when I was playing.

01:32.700 --> 01:36.000
But now there's nothing, you know, no more pain and aches.

01:36.200 --> 01:36.500
Really?

01:36.600 --> 01:40.150
Yeah, every time I wake up so that's a good start of the day.

01:40.250 --> 01:40.900
That's amazing.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.350
I don't play tennis and I hurt every morning.

01:44.250 --> 01:45.700
I feel like it every morning, yeah.

01:46.750 --> 01:47.200
Wow.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.000
Yeah.

01:48.050 --> 01:48.800
And you drink more.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.600
So, you have a headache obviously.

01:51.800 --> 01:54.350
A headache and a sore throat, my eyes are bloodshot.
