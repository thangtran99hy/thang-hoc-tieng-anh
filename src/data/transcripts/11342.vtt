Loosen up your belt.

00:02.064 --> 00:04.677
Let's take a moment to give thanks for Thanksgiving.

00:18.319 --> 00:21.181
To most Americans, the Pilgrims of Plymouth, Massachusetts...

00:21.271 --> 00:24.379
...are the iconic inspiration for today's Thanksgiving feast.

00:26.218 --> 00:30.193
After the winter of 1620 killed almost half of their people,...

00:31.417 --> 00:35.514
...the colonists formed a relationship with the neighboring Wampanoag tribe...

00:36.341 --> 00:38.977
...who taught them about fishing, planting, and hunting.

00:40.239 --> 00:44.376
By autumn of 1621, the colonists had collected enough food...

00:44.475 --> 00:46.778
...to feed the community through the coming winter.

00:47.208 --> 00:51.647

00:51.967 --> 00:55.651

01:01.142 --> 01:04.961
...he declared the last thursday of November to be Thanksgiving Day.

01:08.119 --> 01:10.607
Most of all, Thanksgiving is about family.

01:11.789 --> 01:13.962
With modern life moving faster than ever,...

01:14.676 --> 01:17.537
...Thanksgiving gives us a day to take a collective breath,...

01:19.321 --> 01:20.757
...reconnect with loved ones,...

01:21.037 --> 01:23.773
...and remember just how much we have to be thankful for.
