00:00.050 --> 00:04.950
We came here to Nepal to actually oversee the measurement of the height of Khagendra...

00:05.050 --> 00:07.350
...which was taken by a doctor at the hospital.

00:07.700 --> 00:12.900
We have very strict and precise rules for how the measurement should be taken for the shortest man.

00:12.950 --> 00:14.650
He has to be measured three times a day:...

00:14.700 --> 00:16.950
...in the morning, at noon, and in the evening.

00:17.250 --> 00:20.650
And then, we take the average measurement for official result of the record.

00:22.150 --> 00:25.700
The shortest man record is one that grabs people's attention from all over the world.

00:25.800 --> 00:30.000
And 2010 has seen a lot occur in this record category.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.450
Sadly, He Pingping died early this year.

00:33.650 --> 00:37.500
And then, the world was left wondering who the next shortest person would be.

00:37.900 --> 00:44.200
We discovered a man, Edward NiÃ±o Hernandez in Colombia, in Bogota early this year...

00:44.450 --> 00:46.400
...and he held the record for a few months,...

00:46.450 --> 00:50.100
...but now, the record officially belongs to Khagendra here in Nepal.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.650
We've known Khagendra for a while now.

00:59.750 --> 01:04.600
It's actually, he's been on our database as the shortest teenager for a few months already...

01:04.700 --> 01:07.589
...and we were waiting for him to turn 18,...

01:07.678 --> 01:08.757
...and become an adult before we could measure him...

01:08.700 --> 01:10.400
...for the record for the shortest man.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.500
And we've done this today, and it's fantastic that we could do it on his birthday.
