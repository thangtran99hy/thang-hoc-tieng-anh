Hello! Welcome to Michael's Better Business English.

00:04.433 --> 00:08.317
This month, we're looking at a difficult but important topic in business:...

00:08.767 --> 00:11.050
...How to apologize politely.

00:12.033 --> 00:15.850
Now, this is a very difficult area for many Japanese business people...

00:16.333 --> 00:20.050
...because it's very different culture to culture.

00:20.917 --> 00:26.417
Traditional Japanese polite style, meaning uses lots of polite language and bowing...

00:26.767 --> 00:29.117
...but it's quite different than say, Western style.

00:29.967 --> 00:35.383
In countries such as America or Germany, apologizing is usually used rarely...

00:35.867 --> 00:39.083
...and to indicate accepting personal responsibility.

00:39.800 --> 00:44.034
So, you need to be careful when and how should you apologize...

00:44.153 --> 00:46.950
...when working with people from different cultures.

00:48.167 --> 00:53.217
Some advice to help you in general though, when apologizing to Western business people.

00:54.167 --> 00:56.117
Use these four steps.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.850
First, apologize.

00:59.633 --> 01:03.117
For example, "We are so sorry for the delay of the delivery."

01:04.233 --> 01:07.283
Second, give a clear reason for the problem.

01:08.433 --> 01:10.850
"This was due to a mistake in our factory."

01:12.133 --> 01:18.583
Third, make an action clear that you will take in order to avoid the problem from happening again.

01:19.733 --> 01:25.983
Example, "We are changing our factory production schedule to avoid any future delays."

01:27.033 --> 01:28.983
And then finally, apologize again.

01:29.833 --> 01:32.983
"Again, we'd like to apologize for this accident."

01:34.667 --> 01:39.317
Use these four steps for a polite, clear, and effective apology.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.583
Thank you and good luck!
