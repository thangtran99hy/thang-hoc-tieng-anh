00:08.300 --> 00:08.700
Kick me.

00:11.700 --> 00:12.100
Kick me.

00:21.700 --> 00:22.400
What was that?

00:23.100 --> 00:23.900
An exhibition?

00:24.450 --> 00:27.700
We need emotional content.

00:30.450 --> 00:31.050
Try again.

00:43.350 --> 00:46.750
I said emotional content, not anger.

00:47.950 --> 00:50.300
Now try again, with me.

01:01.850 --> 01:02.300
That's it.

01:04.450 --> 01:05.500
How did it feel to you?

01:08.700 --> 01:09.900
Let me think.

01:11.200 --> 01:13.700
Don't think! Feel.

01:14.750 --> 01:17.850
It is like a finger pointing away to the Moon.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.200
Don't concentrate on the finger or you will miss all that heavenly glory.

01:28.250 --> 01:29.250
Now, do you understand?

01:34.350 --> 01:38.300
Never take your eyes off your opponent, even when you bow.

01:40.800 --> 01:41.750
That's it.
