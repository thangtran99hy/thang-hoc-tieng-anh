When I started writing the VI series,...

00:05.300 --> 00:10.600
...just because I didn't have confidence in what I was trying to do,...

00:10.700 --> 00:17.050
...I was writing out of the male rules of the form.

00:17.500 --> 00:19.300
So, I made her an orphan.

00:19.850 --> 00:24.300
Today, if I was starting out, I wouldn't make her an orphan,...

00:24.950 --> 00:36.950
...but unconsciously, I didn't like the lone wolf personality maybe,...

00:37.000 --> 00:41.100
...and so, instantly, she began having friends.

00:41.150 --> 00:48.450
So, Lotty is her closest friend in a way but is not an uncritical friend.

00:50.650 --> 00:54.700
She's really like both a friend and sort of a mother too.

00:54.750 --> 01:02.600
You know, she doesn't let VI get away with feeling sorry for herself, sloppy thinking...

01:05.200 --> 01:12.200
...and if VI has her biggest fault is lack of impulse control.

01:14.350 --> 01:20.500
But she's always just diving in and that's where Lotty most often criticizes her.

01:20.550 --> 01:22.100
"You stop and think first."
