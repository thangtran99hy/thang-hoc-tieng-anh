Even though you're singing like verbally right,...

00:02.320 --> 00:05.538
...I see so much expression going on with your, like whole body...

00:05.647 --> 00:09.175
...and I guess you were kind of, like grasping the lyrics...

00:09.233 --> 00:13.483
...and kind of putting into the... what's that like?

00:15.500 --> 00:21.050
A lot of people know that every time I sing, like I'm really, really into it, the moment,...

00:21.667 --> 00:26.950
...but when that time, when I couldn't even understand English or say a word,...

00:27.500 --> 00:29.683
...my mom really, like taught me.

00:31.133 --> 00:33.869
When I was singing an English song, you know,...

00:33.934 --> 00:38.772
..she was trying to translate it to Tagalog...

00:39.533 --> 00:42.583
...so I can understand it when I sing it in English.

00:42.700 --> 00:47.817
So, that was like our technique. That's why I was feeling the song.

00:48.633 --> 00:56.450
You know, the people thought that I knew what does it mean or whatever...

00:57.233 --> 01:00.077
...because my mom has been translating it.

01:00.133 --> 01:07.183
Alright, why don't you consider singing a song in Tagalog, like to the Philippine market?

01:08.233 --> 01:09.617
Well, I mean I did.

01:09.707 --> 01:13.983
I mean, I did sing a lot of Tagalog songs in the Philippines.

01:14.067 --> 01:23.717
But you know, sometimes English songs are, like so popular in the Philippines...

01:23.789 --> 01:26.117
...so that's why I'm mostly doing English songs.

01:26.199 --> 01:34.017
But still, we have this music called OPM which means, like Filipino music and all that.

01:35.167 --> 01:40.683
And I still sing Filipino songs. Until now, I still sing Filipino songs for them.

01:40.767 --> 01:44.017
I mean, it's really important for them that I have a Tagalog tune.

01:44.085 --> 01:46.983
That's why in my album, my debut album in the States,...

01:47.367 --> 01:50.917
...there's this one song that I co-wrote and it has a rap on it.

01:50.998 --> 01:52.883
This rap is famous in the Philippines.

01:53.333 --> 01:56.283
And I wrote it, and it has Tagalog words...

01:56.967 --> 02:01.083
...because it's really important for the Filipinos.
