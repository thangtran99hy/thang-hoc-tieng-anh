Delighted to be here and to talk to you about a subject near to my heart which is beauty.

00:21.450 --> 00:24.600
Now, this is an extremely complicated subject.

00:25.100 --> 00:28.850
In part, because the things that we call beautiful are so different.

00:28.900 --> 00:31.100
I mean, just think of the sheer variety:...

00:31.600 --> 00:32.950
...A baby's face,...

00:33.350 --> 00:35.150
...Berlioz's Harold in Italy,...

00:35.600 --> 00:38.800
...movies like "The Wizard of Oz" or the plays of Chekhov,...

00:39.250 --> 00:41.200
...a Central California landscape,...

00:41.650 --> 00:43.700
...a Hokusai view of Mount Fuji,...

00:44.200 --> 00:45.550
...Der Rosenkavalier,...

00:46.050 --> 00:49.500
...a stunning match-winning goal in a World Cup soccer match,...

00:50.000 --> 00:51.600
...Van Gogh's Starry Night,...

00:52.200 --> 00:53.600
...a Jane Austen novel,...

00:54.250 --> 00:56.650
...Fred Astaire dancing across the screen.

00:57.100 --> 01:02.100
This brief list includes human beings, natural landforms,...

01:02.500 --> 01:05.100
...works of art, and skilled human actions.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.300
An account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy.

01:11.850 --> 01:15.200
I can however, give you at least a taste...

01:15.650 --> 01:20.300
...of what I regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have.

01:20.900 --> 01:26.650
This theory comes from an expert on barnacles, and worms, and pigeon breeding.

01:29.850 --> 01:33.000
And you know who I mean, Charles Darwin.

01:35.050 --> 01:39.300
We find beauty in something done well.

01:41.250 --> 01:47.150
So, the next time you pass by a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop-shaped stone,...

01:47.200 --> 01:52.600
...don't be so sure it's just your culture telling you that sparkling jewel is beautiful.

01:53.450 --> 01:55.900
Your distant ancestors loved that shape...

01:56.200 --> 01:58.900
...and found beauty in the skill needed to make it,...

01:59.500 --> 02:02.700
...even before they could put their love into words.
