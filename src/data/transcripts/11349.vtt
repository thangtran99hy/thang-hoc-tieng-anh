How do you explain when things don't go as we assume?

00:19.645 --> 00:24.345
Or better, how do you explain when others are able to achieve things...

00:24.408 --> 00:26.145
...that seem to defy all of the assumptions?

00:27.000 --> 00:29.950
For example, why is Apple so innovative?

00:30.633 --> 00:32.947
Year after year, after year, after year,...

00:33.131 --> 00:35.433
...they're more innovative than all their competition...

00:36.100 --> 00:37.700
...and yet, they're just a computer company.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.200
They're just like everyone else.

00:39.567 --> 00:41.742
They have the same access to the same talent,...

00:42.014 --> 00:44.697
...the same agencies, the same consultants, the same media.

00:45.150 --> 00:48.300
Then, why is it that they seem to have something different?

00:49.967 --> 00:51.434
There's a pattern, as it turns out,...

00:51.621 --> 00:55.285
...all the great, and inspiring leaders, and organizations in the world,...

00:55.300 --> 00:57.500
...whether it's Apple, or Martin Luther King, or the Wright brothers,...

00:57.850 --> 01:01.800
...they all think, act, and communicate the exact same way,...

01:02.450 --> 01:05.250
...and it's the complete opposite to everyone else.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.300
Why. How. What.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.600
This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't.

01:16.867 --> 01:18.664
Well, as a result, the way we think, the way we act,...

01:18.773 --> 01:20.756
...the way we communicate is from the outside in.

01:20.800 --> 01:21.350
It's obvious.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.800
We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing.

01:24.500 --> 01:27.900
But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations,...

01:28.400 --> 01:31.200
...regardless of their size, regardless of their industry,...

01:31.700 --> 01:34.700
...all think, act, and communicate from the inside out...

01:36.000 --> 01:38.450
...because there are leaders and there are those who lead.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.650
Leaders hold a position of power or authority,...

01:42.900 --> 01:45.750
...but those who lead, inspire us.

01:47.500 --> 01:51.250
Whether they're individuals or organizations, we follow those who lead,...

01:51.600 --> 01:54.600
...not because we have to, but because we want to.

01:55.700 --> 01:59.850
We follow those who lead not for them; but for ourselves.

02:01.367 --> 02:03.382
And it's those who start with why"...

02:04.233 --> 02:08.197
...that have the ability to inspire those around them,...

02:08.600 --> 02:10.750
...or find others who inspire them.

02:12.000 --> 02:12.700
Thank you very much!
