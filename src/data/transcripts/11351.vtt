00:06.450 --> 00:07.300
See that city?

00:09.000 --> 00:11.850
It was my city before the Rat King took it from me.

00:18.600 --> 00:20.950
His kingdom was overthrown,...

00:22.300 --> 00:24.400
...a curse was cast upon him,...

00:24.500 --> 00:25.600
No!

00:25.700 --> 00:29.300
...and he was banished from his world forever.

00:31.300 --> 00:32.800
Merry Christmas, you two.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.900
Meet, NC.

00:36.300 --> 00:38.250
Until one magical night,...

00:40.700 --> 00:45.000
...he discovered someone who could change everything.

00:48.450 --> 00:49.250
Hello, Mary.

00:49.800 --> 00:50.800
You can talk.

00:50.900 --> 00:52.700
I've been waiting for someone like you.

00:52.900 --> 00:55.350
Only you have the power to break the curse.

00:58.600 --> 01:02.200
I'm going back to fight the Rat King and reclaim my kingdom.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.400
Will you join me?

01:08.800 --> 01:09.350
Yes.

01:14.300 --> 01:14.950
Is this real?

01:15.150 --> 01:17.050
Reality is merely an illusion.

01:18.050 --> 01:18.700
You did it.

01:18.850 --> 01:20.350
I knew you'd believe.

01:20.450 --> 01:22.500
The spell on the prince is broken.

01:24.450 --> 01:25.950
This holiday season...

01:26.000 --> 01:27.200
It's so beautiful.

01:27.400 --> 01:31.100
...experience one of the most beloved stories of our time...

01:34.300 --> 01:34.700
Sorry.

01:35.350 --> 01:37.300
...like you've never dreamt it before...

01:42.400 --> 01:44.750
Wow! Can you do that again, please?

01:45.550 --> 01:46.800
...in 3D.

01:50.700 --> 01:51.600
I've got a plan!

01:52.750 --> 01:57.100
Elle Fanning, Nathan Lane, and John Turturro.

01:57.900 --> 02:00.600
Say hello and goodbye to your prince!

02:02.050 --> 02:02.900
We have to stop him.

02:09.750 --> 02:10.500
Watch out!

02:12.600 --> 02:14.900
The Nutcracker in 3d.
