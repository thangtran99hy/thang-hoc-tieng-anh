I promised you that if I ever got any information about your dad,...

00:15.350 --> 00:16.550
...I'd tell you first, right?

00:22.850 --> 00:24.000
I was paged last night.

00:24.550 --> 00:26.400
It came from your dad's office at the arcade.

00:28.050 --> 00:28.450
So?

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
So? The number has been disconnected for 20 years.

00:33.250 --> 00:35.650
Two nights before he disappeared, he came to my house.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.850
He said he was about to change everything...

00:37.900 --> 00:40.300
...science, medicine, religion.

00:41.300 --> 00:42.650
He wouldn't have left that, Sam.

00:43.450 --> 00:44.650
He wouldn't have left you.

00:46.500 --> 00:49.050
Alan, you're acting like I'm gonna find him sitting there working,...

00:50.250 --> 00:52.050
..."Hey, kiddo! I lost track of time."

00:54.900 --> 00:55.800
Wouldn't that be something?

01:44.300 --> 01:44.900
Dad.

01:45.900 --> 01:46.550
Sam.

01:47.350 --> 01:48.300
Long time.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.000
You have no idea.

02:11.750 --> 02:12.050
Whoa!
