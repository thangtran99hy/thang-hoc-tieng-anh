00:04.300 --> 00:06.230
No, no, no.

00:09.170 --> 00:13.200
Sorry, I gotta run. Make yourself at home, okay? There's water in the tap.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.650
Hal, you're late.

00:17.910 --> 00:19.680
This test today, it's important.

00:19.780 --> 00:22.780
I'm gonna make you look good up there, don't worry. Now, let's get these pants off...

00:23.490 --> 00:24.490
...and fly some planes.

00:27.490 --> 00:31.590
When I'm flying, it feels like anything is possible.

00:36.900 --> 00:38.670
It's like no matter how bad things get,...

00:40.410 --> 00:42.370
...there's something good out there...

00:43.040 --> 00:44.340
...just over the horizon.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.160
Your name?

01:09.670 --> 01:11.870
Hal... Hal Jordan.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.940
The ring, it chose you.

01:16.740 --> 01:20.380
Use its power to defend our universe.

01:22.210 --> 01:23.820
Become one of us.

01:25.310 --> 01:28.250
Become a Green Lantern.

01:30.850 --> 01:32.790
The ring itself is a great responsibility.

01:32.890 --> 01:34.360
Responsibility, you?

01:34.760 --> 01:35.460
Let's hope so.

01:38.190 --> 01:40.400
Anything I see in my mind, I can create.

01:42.570 --> 01:46.800
The one thing that a Green Lantern is supposed to be is fearless,...

01:48.200 --> 01:48.900
...that isn't me.

01:53.310 --> 01:55.180
You have the ability to overcome fear.

02:05.520 --> 02:05.990
Wow!

02:06.420 --> 02:07.520
I know, right?

02:10.660 --> 02:11.330
Whew!

02:15.460 --> 02:16.230
What happens now?

02:17.170 --> 02:18.070
I go look for trouble.

02:19.170 --> 02:21.810
In brightest day, in blackest night.
