Whaddup, Summerfest! This is Justin Bieber.

00:09.910 --> 00:11.270
You know, it's been really fun and...

00:11.680 --> 00:14.680
...just being able to travel around the world, being able to see a lot of cool things, and...

00:15.280 --> 00:21.680
...just be able to experience new culture and different just like how people are living.

00:22.060 --> 00:25.320
It's always just definitely been a blessing. I've been able to just live my dream...

00:25.420 --> 00:29.060
...and be able to perform for a lot of people, which has been, you know, the best.

00:29.760 --> 00:33.200
It's definite that I get a lot of downtime now that I'm on tour.

00:33.630 --> 00:37.730
Usually, for the past two years, I've been just go, go, go, interviews,...

00:39.444 --> 00:40.669
...just flying everywhere.

00:40.726 --> 00:45.107
Now that I have a bus and, you know, it's a regimented schedule every day, so...

00:45.440 --> 00:49.710
...I'm looking forward to just touring and being able to be on the road with my friends,...

00:49.840 --> 00:50.750
...and just have a good time.

00:51.250 --> 00:52.250
Water gun fights.

00:53.420 --> 00:59.190
Where I'm used to performing in like inside. So, you know, it's different. My tour,...

01:01.260 --> 01:05.590
...we've been doing a lot of like stuff where I'm hanging from like the sky and stuff.

01:05.690 --> 01:09.270
You can't do that outside, obviously, 'cause there's no rig, but,...

01:10.010 --> 01:13.170
...you know, we're gonna have to alter the show a little bit, but it'll be fun.

01:18.270 --> 01:20.380
The fans have been incredible.

01:22.420 --> 01:26.720
I was found on Youtube, so, you know, it was basically fans.

01:27.580 --> 01:33.460
It's like made by fans. It's not branded. You're not, you know, I wasn't made.

01:33.590 --> 01:39.830
It was kind of like I posted videos and just kinda slowly but surely, grew fans,...

01:40.600 --> 01:43.800
...and it got more and more. So, my fans have gotten me to this position and,...

01:44.400 --> 01:45.830
...you know, I owe everything to the fans.
