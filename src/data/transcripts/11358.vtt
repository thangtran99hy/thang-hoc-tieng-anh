00:02.350 --> 00:03.630
Are you sure you're 18?

00:03.850 --> 00:04.770
Why? Do I look older?

00:05.200 --> 00:08.000
Edmund, you're supposed to be helping me with the groceries.

00:08.350 --> 00:09.710
Better luck next time, eh, squirt!

00:10.250 --> 00:11.870
Squirt? I'm a king!

00:12.140 --> 00:13.230
Not in this world.

00:15.310 --> 00:17.250
Lucy, have you seen this ship before?

00:18.780 --> 00:20.350
It's very Narnian looking, isn't it?

00:20.920 --> 00:21.650
What's going on here?

00:21.820 --> 00:22.720
Edmund, the painting!

00:23.790 --> 00:24.550
Don't, Eustace!

00:24.910 --> 00:25.270
No!

00:32.700 --> 00:33.460
Edmund!

00:36.900 --> 00:37.500
Aslan.

00:37.600 --> 00:41.370
Welcome. You have come far but your journey lies beyond.

00:41.470 --> 00:42.370
Reepicheep!

00:43.130 --> 00:44.150
Your Majesties.

00:44.710 --> 00:45.940
So, if there are no wars to fight,...

00:46.710 --> 00:47.610
...then why are we here?

00:49.340 --> 00:51.610
You are all about to be tested.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.850
Edmund, I can make you my king and much more.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.160
I'm beautiful.

01:12.150 --> 01:14.200
You've got an extraordinary destiny,...

01:15.110 --> 01:17.170
...something greater than you could have imagined.

01:18.140 --> 01:20.640
From C.S. Lewis' epic masterpiece,...

01:20.910 --> 01:22.690
The fate of Narnia depends on you.

01:23.150 --> 01:23.810
...this December,...

01:31.290 --> 01:33.190
This place just gets weirder and weirder.

01:34.620 --> 01:36.260
You have returned for a reason.

01:37.010 --> 01:39.500
Your adventure begins now.

01:44.970 --> 01:48.340
