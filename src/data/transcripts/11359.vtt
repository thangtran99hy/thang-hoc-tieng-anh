00:02.000 --> 00:02.900
Maybe it's my own fault.

00:04.700 --> 00:07.600
Maybe I led you to believe it was easy, when it wasn't.

00:09.350 --> 00:12.200
Maybe I made you think my highlights started at the free throw line...

00:12.650 --> 00:13.500
...and not in the gym.

00:15.650 --> 00:18.450
Maybe I made you think that every shot I took was a game winner,...

00:21.200 --> 00:24.200
...that my game was built on flash and not fire.

00:26.900 --> 00:29.900
Maybe it's my fault that you didn't see that failure gave me strength,...

00:30.500 --> 00:32.600
...that my pain was my motivation.

00:34.850 --> 00:38.000
Maybe I led you to believe that basketball was a God-given gift,...

00:38.550 --> 00:43.200
...and not something I worked for every single day of my life.

00:47.250 --> 00:48.600
Maybe I destroyed the game.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Or maybe, you're just making excuses.
