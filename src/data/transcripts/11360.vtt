I'll tell you this: In any fight,...

00:03.497 --> 00:07.515
...it's the guy who's willing to die who's gonna win that inch.

00:08.931 --> 00:11.047
And I know if I'm gonna have any life anymore,...

00:11.929 --> 00:15.901
...it's because I'm still willing to fight and die for that inch,...

00:17.898 --> 00:20.186
...because that's what living is:

00:21.361 --> 00:23.699
The six inches in front of your face.

00:24.582 --> 00:26.163
Now, I can't make you do it.

00:27.278 --> 00:29.072
You gotta look at the guy next to you.

00:29.342 --> 00:30.639
Look into his eyes.

00:31.106 --> 00:35.321
Now, I think you're gonna see a guy who will go that inch with you.

00:35.942 --> 00:40.955
You're gonna see a guy who will sacrifice himself for this team...

00:41.278 --> 00:45.895
...because he knows when it comes down to it, you're gonna do the same for him.

00:47.935 --> 00:49.425
That's a team, gentlemen.

00:50.551 --> 00:55.238
And, either we heal now as a team...

00:57.203 --> 01:00.035
...or we will die as individuals.

01:04.255 --> 01:05.317
That's football, guys.

01:09.462 --> 01:10.315
That's all it is.

01:12.539 --> 01:16.450
Now, what are you gonna do?
