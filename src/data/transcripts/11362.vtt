It's Christmas time! It's cold here at McKinley.

00:08.500 --> 00:13.640
It's Christmas! We are singing some Christmas carols which I'm really excited about 'cause I love Christmas.

00:13.810 --> 00:16.460
Everybody's in sweaters and scarves, and it's fun.

00:17.630 --> 00:22.280
This is the most Christmassy it's been in a very long time.

00:22.590 --> 00:25.050
"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" and "Angels We Have Heard on High"...

00:25.150 --> 00:27.190
...are my favorite songs from the Christmas soundtrack.

00:27.320 --> 00:30.030
Naya kills "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen".

00:30.560 --> 00:32.630
She comes in and that's like "Whoa!"

00:32.730 --> 00:35.810
Like, I really wanna listen to her right now. Can it be playing in the background?

00:42.300 --> 00:46.170
I was way into the magic of Christmas as a kid. I used to look at the tree...

00:46.290 --> 00:50.550
...and try to get in the mood. You just love them.

00:51.610 --> 00:53.450
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.020
I would like to wish you all a Happy Holiday.

00:56.290 --> 00:59.590
Just wanna wish everybody a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

01:04.030 --> 01:04.930
Happy holidays.
