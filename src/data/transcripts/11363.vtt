Hello. My name is Birke Baehr, and I'm 11 years old.

00:20.280 --> 00:23.750
I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system.

00:24.250 --> 00:27.020
First of all, I would like to say that I'm really amazed...

00:27.110 --> 00:31.290
...at how easily kids are led to believe all the marketing and advertising on TV,...

00:31.590 --> 00:34.160
...at public schools and pretty much everywhere else you look.

00:34.460 --> 00:38.800
It seems to me like, corporations are always trying to get kids like me...

00:39.030 --> 00:42.440
...to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn't good for us or the planet.

00:42.870 --> 00:47.910
Little kids, especially, are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys.

00:48.110 --> 00:50.480
I must admit, I used to be one of them.

00:51.050 --> 00:55.180
I also used to think that all of our food came from these happy, little farms...

00:55.420 --> 00:58.090
...where pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.190
What I discovered was this is not true.

01:01.700 --> 01:04.960
I began to look into this stuff on the Internet, in books...

01:05.090 --> 01:07.830
...and in documentary films, in my travels with my family.

01:08.160 --> 01:11.270
I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system.

01:12.270 --> 01:15.370
First, there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms.

01:15.670 --> 01:20.440
That is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not intended by nature.

01:20.710 --> 01:24.810
...and don't even get me started on the confined animal feeding operations, called CAFOs.

01:27.220 --> 01:29.750
Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers...

01:29.880 --> 01:32.820
...made from fossil fuels that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.090
They do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients...

01:36.160 --> 01:38.890
...from growing the same crop over and over again.

01:39.060 --> 01:41.830
So I ask myself, "How can I change?"

01:42.060 --> 01:43.570
"How can I change these things?"

01:43.930 --> 01:45.200
This is what I found out.

01:45.530 --> 01:48.000
I discovered that there's a movement for a better way.

01:48.240 --> 01:50.670
I want you to know that we can all make a difference...

01:50.910 --> 01:52.340
...by making different choices,...

01:52.580 --> 01:54.740
...by buying our food directly from local farmers,...

01:54.840 --> 01:56.610
...or neighbors we know in real life.

01:57.380 --> 01:59.900
Some people say organic or local food is more expensive,...

02:00.080 --> 02:00.900
...but is it really?

02:01.180 --> 02:03.790
With all these things I've been learning about the food system,...

02:03.955 --> 02:07.620
...it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer, or we can pay the hospital.

02:08.490 --> 02:08.960
I know...

02:16.300 --> 02:18.200
Now, I know definitely which one I would choose.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.940
So next time you're at the grocery store, think local,...

02:21.140 --> 02:24.210
...choose organic, know your farm, and know your food. Thank you.
