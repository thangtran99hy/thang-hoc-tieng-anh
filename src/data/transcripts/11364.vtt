00:00.250 --> 00:03.500
Not a bad location to be if you wanna get your message out there.

00:03.700 --> 00:08.300
Think of all the people who are going to see that billboard heading into the city over the next month.

00:08.500 --> 00:11.850
But the message, it's not necessarily sitting well with Christians.

00:12.100 --> 00:17.600
This beaming blue billboard on a major highway into the city is getting a lot of attention.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.150
Everybody has their own beliefs...

00:19.267 --> 00:21.958
...but that's not really something you put on a billboard...

00:22.027 --> 00:24.347
...and advertise for like, the whole world to see.

00:24.350 --> 00:26.600
The American Atheists feel differently.

00:26.900 --> 00:29.450
The group paid 20 thousand bucks for the billboard...

00:29.700 --> 00:34.700
...which depicts the three wise men heading to a nativity scene calling it a myth.

00:34.900 --> 00:38.350
The intent here is not to convert Christians.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.131
The intent here is to get atheists...

00:41.409 --> 00:47.117
...who are going through the motions and pretending to be religious to stop,...

00:47.450 --> 00:48.500
...come out of the closet,...

00:48.750 --> 00:50.300
...be honest with themselves.

00:50.433 --> 00:52.148
Silverman, an avowed atheist...

00:52.268 --> 00:55.413
...said Christians have laid false claim to the winter solstice...

00:55.600 --> 00:58.750
...and feels that Christmas has become far too commercial.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.800
We're not gonna say that you can't put a billboard up...

01:01.400 --> 01:04.150
...but I think you are just fooling yourself...

01:04.200 --> 01:08.600
...if you think it's anything other than just a dumb message of Christmas time.

01:08.800 --> 01:12.000
So, what is the verdict since the billboard just went up yesterday?

01:12.250 --> 01:17.400
I think it's okay because, you know, everybody believes what they believe.

01:17.500 --> 01:20.450
I feel like if you're an atheist you're gonna seek out your own group anyway.

01:20.800 --> 01:24.200
You don't need to broadcast it and knock a Christian faith...

01:24.450 --> 01:25.300
...you know, just to do it.

01:25.350 --> 01:27.600
It's a time for family, for reunion.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.200
It's a time for hope basically.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.750
It's wrong what they're doing.

01:33.050 --> 01:33.900
It's wrong.

01:34.100 --> 01:36.850
Now, the billboard company apparently approached some Christian groups...

01:36.900 --> 01:40.000
...to see if they wanted to put up a competing sign across the road,...

01:40.300 --> 01:43.050
...but they felt their money could be better spent elsewhere.
