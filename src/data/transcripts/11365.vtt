I'm Alex Villareal with the VOA Special English Economics Report.

00:06.500 --> 00:12.240
They are not even five millimeters long and cannot fly or jump.

00:12.700 --> 00:18.330
Yet bedbugs strike fear in homeowners and business owners.

00:18.660 --> 00:23.500
Missy Henriksen speaks for the National Pest Management Association.

00:24.060 --> 00:29.200
She says they are now seeing bedbugs in unusual places.

00:29.500 --> 00:34.030
Schools and hospitals, stores, and movie theaters.

00:34.530 --> 00:37.040
So, as the numbers have grown,...

00:37.360 --> 00:43.360
...those bedbugs are spreading out and traveling along with people.

00:43.960 --> 00:51.930
Mr. White says bedbugs nearly disappeared from the United States for 50 or 60 years.

00:52.630 --> 00:58.930
Now, researchers are looking for faster, safer ways to control them...

00:59.160 --> 01:03.130
...without the kinds of poisons used in the past.

01:03.430 --> 01:10.590
In September, an industry event called BedBug University's North American Summit 2010...

01:10.930 --> 01:13.530
...took place near Chicago, Illinois.

01:14.230 --> 01:18.800
More than 360 people attended the 2-day meeting.

01:19.730 --> 01:25.200
The industry says bedbugs are the most difficult pest to control.

01:25.900 --> 01:34.460
Treatments can cost from several hundred dollars to thousands of dollars in a hotel or apartment building.

01:35.300 --> 01:45.100
Missy Henriksen says Americans spent almost 260 million dollars on bedbug treatments last year.

01:45.900 --> 01:51.100
That was only 5% of total spending on pest control,...

01:51.630 --> 01:55.230
...but that number does not include other costs.

01:56.030 --> 02:00.600
She says the total economic effect is much greater.

02:01.400 --> 02:06.930
Businesses that have bedbugs often must close to solve the problem.

02:08.100 --> 02:11.800
Bedbugs have not been shown to spread disease.

02:12.430 --> 02:19.500
But they can leave itchy bite marks and cause allergic reactions in some people.
