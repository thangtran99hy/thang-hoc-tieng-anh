00:03.350 --> 00:09.570
In 2006, two unlikely friends became the heroes of Radiator Springs.

00:10.340 --> 00:12.370
But on their next big road trip,...

00:12.810 --> 00:15.480
...they're not only racing across the world,...

00:15.580 --> 00:16.150
Wish me luck.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.380
You go get 'em, buddy.

00:18.080 --> 00:21.320
Welcome to the inaugural running of the World Grand Prix.

00:22.180 --> 00:24.550
...they're racing to save the world.

00:25.220 --> 00:26.860
No one can stop us.

00:29.590 --> 00:32.040
Finn McMissile, British Intelligence.

00:32.140 --> 00:34.630
Tow Mater, average intelligence.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.230
Welcome to Tokyo International Airport.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.820
Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs.

00:41.920 --> 00:44.380
These Americans are clearly master spies.

00:46.350 --> 00:47.480
Oh, you've gotta be joking!

00:49.450 --> 00:50.530
Go, McQueen!

00:50.630 --> 00:51.450
10-4 Mater.

00:51.850 --> 00:52.460
I'm on approach.

00:52.600 --> 00:53.120
Roger that.

00:53.320 --> 00:53.730
There he is!

00:53.830 --> 00:54.880
He's getting away.

00:55.280 --> 00:55.800
Hang on!

01:00.990 --> 01:01.690
Yeah, go!

01:03.730 --> 01:07.160
Whoa! I knew I should have done carry-on.

01:10.430 --> 01:11.330
Cars 2.

01:11.570 --> 01:12.370
Ka-chow!

01:15.410 --> 01:16.240
Sorry, lady.
