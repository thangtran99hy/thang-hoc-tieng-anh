Hi, this is Craig Glenday, editor-in-chief of Guinness World Records 2011.

00:12.270 --> 00:16.410
Earlier this year, Guinness World Records invited a handful of record holders to Rome...

00:16.650 --> 00:18.910
...to film a TV series for the Italians.

00:19.580 --> 00:23.890
Among the giants, dwarves, hairy families, and daredevil stuntmen that turned up,...

00:24.190 --> 00:26.860
...one talent stood out for his unique abilities.

00:27.490 --> 00:29.990
He was Francisco Domingo Joaquin.

00:30.630 --> 00:33.800
And don't worry if you find his name a bit of a mouthful, you can call him Chiquinho.

00:34.660 --> 00:37.830
He holds the Guinness World Records certificate for, yes you guessed it,...

00:38.230 --> 00:39.600
...the world's widest mouth.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.180
This jaw-dropping talent from Sambizanga in Angola,...

00:45.540 --> 00:50.010
...was discovered by Guinness World Records researchers while scouting Youtube for new talent.

00:50.650 --> 00:54.950
After the two-year hunt, we finally tracked him down to a marketplace in his hometown...

00:55.320 --> 00:57.200
...and were able to measure his massive mouth.

01:03.590 --> 01:07.030
At 17 centimeters wide, that's just over six and a half inches,...

01:07.330 --> 01:11.170
...Chiquinho's mouth is big enough to fit a drink's can in sideways.

01:11.900 --> 01:14.700
And as for his ability to stretch his lips over his face...

01:15.000 --> 01:18.240
...well, that's a unique talent we can safely say we've never seen before.
