Midnight Rider weighs 25 and a half tons.

00:26.652 --> 00:29.763
That's the equivalent of 10 to 12 super stretch limousines.

00:29.985 --> 00:35.759
It's 70 feet long, 14 feet high, and eight and a half feet wide.

00:35.973 --> 00:39.633
It has 22 wheels, 440 horsepower.

00:39.802 --> 00:44.699
It takes a crew of five, has a bar, a forward lounge, an observation lounge...

00:44.851 --> 00:47.266
...and a rear lounge to carry 40 passengers.

00:47.357 --> 00:50.480
And we are very pleased to have it in the Guinness Book of World Records.

00:50.852 --> 00:53.645
Well, we weren't originally trying to obtain a world record.

00:53.721 --> 00:58.039
That kind of came about as we were in the planning stages...

00:58.152 --> 01:00.003
...of building the Midnight Rider.

01:00.789 --> 01:02.499
It took us seven years to build it...

01:03.043 --> 01:07.407
...and we built it in the household by ourselves, four people basically.

01:07.857 --> 01:13.901
And we wanted people to be able to travel together in groups again...

01:14.001 --> 01:14.891
...at a slower pace...

01:14.962 --> 01:16.683
...like they used to do in the railroad days.

01:16.841 --> 01:20.519
I grew up reading the Guinness Book of World Records.

01:20.613 --> 01:24.356
Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought we'd be in it...

01:24.442 --> 01:26.545
...as the heaviest limousine in the world.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.684
And we are just so excited that that has happened.
