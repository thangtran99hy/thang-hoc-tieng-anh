00:04.350 --> 00:05.070
Merry Christmas.

00:05.270 --> 00:05.920
Merry Christmas.

00:06.020 --> 00:06.600
How's your leg?

00:06.730 --> 00:08.000
Very good, thanks for asking. Come on in.

00:10.340 --> 00:13.810
Oh! Good, Penny, you're here to exchange gifts.

00:17.250 --> 00:20.350
You'll be pleased to know I'm prepared for whatever you have to offer.

00:21.950 --> 00:23.120
Okay, here.

00:27.210 --> 00:30.300
I should note, I'm having some digestive distress...

00:32.430 --> 00:36.000
...so if I excuse myself abruptly, don't be alarmed.

00:44.440 --> 00:47.110
Oh! A napkin.

00:49.510 --> 00:50.750
Turn it over.

00:57.550 --> 01:04.190
"To Sheldon, live long and prosper. Leonard Nimoy".

01:08.130 --> 01:11.600
He came into the restaurant. Sorry the napkin's dirty. He wiped his mouth with it.

01:17.310 --> 01:20.610
I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!

01:24.810 --> 01:25.110
Well,...

01:29.550 --> 01:31.890
...yeah, yeah, I guess. But look, he signed it.

01:32.470 --> 01:34.360
Do you realize what this means?

01:37.330 --> 01:41.300
All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!

01:46.630 --> 01:49.840
Okay, all I'm giving you is the napkin, Sheldon.

01:52.910 --> 01:53.510
Be right back.
