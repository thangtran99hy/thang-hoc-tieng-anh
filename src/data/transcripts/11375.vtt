00:00.947 --> 00:06.737
He was really sort of, you know, suave and cheesy, right?

00:06.796 --> 00:07.586
Like Roger. Yeah!

00:07.735 --> 00:07.944
Yeah!

00:08.167 --> 00:15.781
And watching your spy, I feel that he's more Roger Moore than Sean Connery,...

00:15.892 --> 00:17.297
...but that's just my interpretation.

00:17.510 --> 00:19.944
No. I mean, I can see that.

00:20.064 --> 00:24.611
I don't think that Roger was as kind of sarcastically...

00:24.895 --> 00:26.585
...biting as Michael could be.

00:32.361 --> 00:34.562
If you were to call Michael Westen, Roger,...

00:34.912 --> 00:36.967
... Roger Moore, James Bond to his face, he would laugh.

00:37.097 --> 00:37.335
He does that.

00:38.313 --> 00:40.870
I'm not that, you know, suave.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.493
So, he's unconsciously suave. Yeah!

00:46.638 --> 00:49.356
He's very, what's the word?

00:50.109 --> 00:51.243
Confident, you know?

00:51.729 --> 00:52.694
He knows everything very well.

00:53.143 --> 00:53.257
Yeah!

00:53.399 --> 00:55.391
And you learned, you handled that role very well.

00:58.005 --> 01:02.196
You went to acting school, you performed in other TV shows...

01:03.949 --> 01:05.419
...such as "Touching Evil", for example,...

01:07.277 --> 01:11.124
...was it hard to work yourself into this role or was it sort of, did it come naturally?

01:11.344 --> 01:12.984
You know, "Touching Evil" was really hard.

01:14.867 --> 01:17.584
I had to work my butt off to understand that guy.

01:18.808 --> 01:21.619
I didn't necessarily have to work so hard with Michael because...

01:22.047 --> 01:28.205
...he came from a dysfunctional family, ran away, joined an army, and found an identity;...

01:28.650 --> 01:29.772
...becoming other people.

01:29.967 --> 01:30.342
Right, right.

01:31.401 --> 01:32.382
And that's me.

01:34.252 --> 01:35.442
That's Michael and me.

01:35.833 --> 01:36.145
Wow!

01:38.077 --> 01:42.917
When I play Michael, it's almost like a hyperreality of me.

01:43.799 --> 01:46.286
It's a commenting version on my own life.

01:47.366 --> 01:48.059
That's very cool!

01:49.292 --> 01:54.761
When I act here, I often get cast as a foreigner married to a Japanese woman,...

01:55.185 --> 01:59.185
...speaks Japanese, but has problems with it, though been here for a long time.

01:59.891 --> 02:01.995
Sometimes they call me Patrick if it's like...

02:03.833 --> 02:06.989
..."What a stretch!" you know, "Am I acting or am I just walking on the set?"

02:07.063 --> 02:11.224
Well, I think it's harder to play someone closer to you than it is...

02:11.872 --> 02:14.416
...to play someone that's very, very, very faraway from you.

02:14.584 --> 02:14.934
It could be.

02:18.631 --> 02:21.534
I think Michael is close to me in so many ways...

02:21.668 --> 02:25.741
...and it usually would be hard, but for some reason Michael is not hard to act.

02:26.053 --> 02:26.564
That's great!
