00:05.945 --> 00:07.302
I have no arms and no legs,...

00:07.436 --> 00:10.600
...but I'm very thankful that I have my little chicken drumstick here.

00:11.826 --> 00:13.990
People freak out when they see me for the first time.

00:14.299 --> 00:17.897
It's so cool! I was at a waterslide all by myself.

00:18.071 --> 00:20.528
Everyone obviously at the bottom of the slide is looking up,...

00:20.631 --> 00:23.775
...waiting for other people to come down and here I come, and they're freaking out.

00:23.855 --> 00:24.287
They're like,...

00:24.886 --> 00:25.792
...you know, like this.

00:25.943 --> 00:28.676
And I was so tempted to look at myself and go, "What happened?"

00:33.623 --> 00:35.651
There were times when I sort of looked at my life and think,...

00:35.741 --> 00:37.920
..."Well, I can't do this," and "I can't do that".

00:38.567 --> 00:41.131
And you keep on concentrating on the things that you wish you had...

00:41.223 --> 00:43.261
...or the things that you wish you didn't have.

00:43.871 --> 00:45.761
And you sort of forget what you do have.

00:46.607 --> 00:50.646
And there's no point, I believe, in my life, where I wish I had arms and legs,...

00:50.733 --> 00:52.439
...I wish I had arms and legs, I wish I had arms and legs,...

00:52.578 --> 00:53.654
...because wishing won't help.

00:53.757 --> 00:56.929
But what I've seen in life are just a couple of key principles.

00:57.013 --> 00:59.156
And the first thing that I've seen is to be thankful.

00:59.819 --> 01:03.141
I tell you, when I was 8 years old, I sort of summed up my life...

01:03.224 --> 01:04.798
...and thought I'm never gonna get married,...

01:05.311 --> 01:06.524
...you know, I'm not gonna have a job,...

01:06.607 --> 01:08.914
...I'm not gonna have a life of purpose.

01:09.864 --> 01:14.025
What kind of a husband am I gonna be if I can't even hold my wife's hand?

01:16.863 --> 01:19.337
It's a lie to think that you're not good enough.

01:19.441 --> 01:22.699
It's a lie to think that you're not worth anything.
