00:01.000 --> 00:03.130
This is how Americans greet winter.

00:03.300 --> 00:06.740
State highway departments demonstrate their latest snowplow techniques...

00:07.100 --> 00:10.110
...and their mountain of salt for deicing roads.

00:10.570 --> 00:14.040
Snowplow drivers show how cumbersome it is to drive a plow...

00:14.380 --> 00:17.280
...and reflect on 2010's extreme weather.

00:18.050 --> 00:18.750
Lots of snow.

00:19.650 --> 00:20.480
There's too much snow.

00:21.650 --> 00:24.800
In February, more than 50 centimeters of new snow,...

00:24.950 --> 00:28.590
...fell on top of 90 centimeters of snow from a few days earlier.

00:29.130 --> 00:32.230
On the other side of the globe, snow shut down Beijing,...

00:32.530 --> 00:35.900
...with temperatures as low as minus 16 degrees Celsius.

00:36.400 --> 00:41.970
But while Washington and Beijing dug out in winter, others sweated it out later in the summer.

00:42.340 --> 00:45.410
First in Washington, stifling summer heat.

00:45.740 --> 00:49.140
It's excruciatingly hot out here and all I wanna do is keep cool.

00:49.240 --> 00:52.050
I'm looking for the nearest pool but I'll take a sprinkler at anytime.

00:53.220 --> 00:57.790
Earlier in June, 32 degrees Celsius, in Moscow!

00:59.430 --> 01:03.430
Children have gotten tired from the frost. They are enjoying the sun.

01:04.620 --> 01:07.300
A month later in Russia, forest fires...

01:09.800 --> 01:11.670
...and mass evacuations.

01:14.070 --> 01:17.770
August in China, mudslides and torrential rains.

01:19.070 --> 01:22.380
There are probably eight people buried underneath at this site.

01:23.810 --> 01:28.520
In Pakistan, devastating floods put a fifth of the country underwater.
