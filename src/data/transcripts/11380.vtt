This is what it is, okay?

00:04.050 --> 00:05.700
I said, "Empty your mind."...

00:06.850 --> 00:10.650
..."Be formless, shapeless like water."

00:11.850 --> 00:15.650
Now you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup.

00:15.750 --> 00:18.050
You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.

00:18.100 --> 00:20.900
You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.

00:21.300 --> 00:24.500
Now, water can flow or it can crash.

00:25.550 --> 00:27.000
Be water, my friend.
