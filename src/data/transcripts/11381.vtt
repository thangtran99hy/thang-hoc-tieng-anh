There are millions of web apps across the Internet.

00:06.900 --> 00:10.150
They come in all shapes and sizes for any use under the sun.

00:10.550 --> 00:14.050
Most of us though still only use five or six web apps a day...

00:14.600 --> 00:16.200
...and we rarely try new ones.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.100
Why is that?

00:17.400 --> 00:20.500
Well, for one thing, it can be hard to find the right apps.

00:20.750 --> 00:25.500
Sometimes, you don't even know that there's a web app out there that can help you do a particular task.

00:25.950 --> 00:28.250
For instance, editing a video online,...

00:28.700 --> 00:31.600
...let alone where to find it or which one you should choose.

00:32.500 --> 00:36.300
And even if you find a particular app, you might hesitate to try it out,...

00:36.600 --> 00:40.550
...if doing so means sharing private information like your credit card number...

00:40.800 --> 00:42.850
...with a developer you've never heard of before.

00:43.800 --> 00:47.400
If all of this sounds familiar, then you should check out the Chrome Web Store.

00:47.950 --> 00:50.700
The Chrome Web Store is an online marketplace...

00:50.750 --> 00:54.800
...where you can search or browse through categories to discover new web apps.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.650
You can study user reviews and ratings.

00:58.050 --> 01:00.050
And if you find a web app you really like,...

01:00.400 --> 01:05.500
...you can create a convenient shortcut on your Chrome browser's new tab page to easily access it.

01:06.050 --> 01:11.750
In the Chrome Web Store, besides apps, you can even find themes that let you change the look of your browser...

01:12.050 --> 01:16.150
...and thousands of extensions, the small programs that add features to Chrome...

01:16.250 --> 01:19.050
...like email notifications and pricing alerts.

01:19.950 --> 01:23.750
In general, we've designed the Chrome Web Store to be easy to use,...

01:23.900 --> 01:27.750
...fun to discover new apps, and an information-rich place.

01:27.950 --> 01:28.900
Want to check it out?

01:29.300 --> 01:35.200
Just click on the store icon on your new tab or go to Chrome.Google.com/webstore.

01:35.550 --> 01:36.800
Let's see what you discover.
