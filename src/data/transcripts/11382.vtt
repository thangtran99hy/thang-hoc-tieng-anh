00:00.830 --> 00:02.030
What is it like?

00:02.230 --> 00:04.170
The city mobile of the future?

00:04.370 --> 00:07.900
Maybe like BMW's latest concept scooter.

00:07.970 --> 00:10.770
The C1-E electric drive.

00:11.210 --> 00:18.700
BMW launched the original C1 back in 1999 but stopped production of their scooter in 2003...

00:19.080 --> 00:20.520
...due to poor sales.

00:21.320 --> 00:25.590
Now, electric drive and the C1-E is to provide the breakthrough.

00:26.020 --> 00:33.600
BMW claims that the electric power of six to seven kilowatts is sufficient for about 100 kilometers.

00:34.200 --> 00:40.470
An important feature carried over from the original model is the much praised safety concept...

00:41.170 --> 00:44.670
...with its seatbelt, safety cell, and roll bar.

00:45.010 --> 00:49.180
And now, the scooter looks sleeker and even more elegant than ever.

00:49.720 --> 00:57.750
BMW is presenting the C1-E as a special contribution to the eSum European safety project...

00:58.090 --> 01:02.490
...where cities such as Rome, Barcelona, Paris and London,...

01:02.960 --> 01:08.960
...ideal places for a two-wheeler, are cooperating with BMW and Piaggio.

01:09.300 --> 01:15.470
The significant increase in sales produced already shows that riding a scooter in large cities...

01:15.870 --> 01:17.110
...has a great future.

01:17.640 --> 01:21.880
And being completely free of noise and exhaust emissions,...

01:22.115 --> 01:25.850
...the electric scooter certainly has a good potential.

01:26.450 --> 01:30.920
While BMW is not yet looking at series production of the C1-E,...

01:31.440 --> 01:36.420
....the concept vehicle is already perfectly prepared for production.
