00:03.200 --> 00:07.650
Scrooge was a mean man who made his employees work harder than most employers.

00:08.950 --> 00:10.900
Scrooge was now very afraid.

00:11.800 --> 00:14.200
He became even more afraid when a few minutes later...

00:14.650 --> 00:17.300
...he heard a loud noise coming from the rooms beneath the building.

00:18.750 --> 00:22.600
The noise sounded as if someone were dragging some kind of chain across the floor.

00:23.350 --> 00:26.400
Scrooge remembered that this was what ghosts were believed to do.

00:27.350 --> 00:31.400
"What do you want with me?" Scrooge demanded coldly.

00:32.750 --> 00:36.050
"Much!" This was Marley's voice.

00:37.150 --> 00:38.000
"Who are you?"

00:39.050 --> 00:40.600
"Ask me who I was."

00:41.900 --> 00:45.550
"Who were you, then?" said Scrooge, raising his voice.

00:46.500 --> 00:49.300
"In life, I was your partner, Jacob Marley."

00:50.400 --> 00:55.100
"I wear the chain because of the bad things I did when I was alive," replied the ghost.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.250
"You too are making a chain for yourself by the things that you do and do not do."

01:01.250 --> 01:04.900
"You will be visited," continued the ghost, "by three spirits."

01:05.750 --> 01:10.300
"Without their visits," said the ghost, "you cannot hope to avoid my fate."

01:11.450 --> 01:13.250
Suddenly, there was a face at the window.

01:14.300 --> 01:19.050
It was a strange figure like a child, but also like an old man.

01:20.250 --> 01:24.800
"Are you the spirit, sir, about whom I have been told?" asked Scrooge.

01:25.700 --> 01:26.300
"I am!"

01:27.200 --> 01:30.600
"Who and what are you?" Scrooge demanded.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.500
"I am the Spirit of Christmas Past."

01:35.050 --> 01:37.450
Some time later, Scrooge woke up again.

01:38.350 --> 01:39.200
He felt cold.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.850
He knew that soon another spirit would visit him.

01:42.700 --> 01:45.050
"Come in!" exclaimed the spirit.

01:45.850 --> 01:47.900
"Come in and know me better, man!"

01:48.950 --> 01:51.700
Scrooge entered slowly and stood before this spirit.

01:52.400 --> 01:55.650
"I am the Spirit of Christmas Present," said the spirit.

01:56.300 --> 01:57.450
The bell struck twelve.

01:57.850 --> 02:01.150
Scrooge looked about him for the spirit, but it had gone.

02:01.950 --> 02:07.250
As the sound of the bell died away, another spirit appeared and came toward Scrooge.

02:08.300 --> 02:12.000
"Are you the Spirit of Christmas Future?" asked Scrooge.

02:12.850 --> 02:16.400
The Spirit did not answer, but pointed onward with its hand.

02:17.050 --> 02:18.900
The hand was pointed straight before them.

02:19.650 --> 02:21.500
"Lead on!" said Scrooge.

02:21.800 --> 02:26.700
"Lead on! The night is nearly over, and I need to see everything before the morning."

02:27.600 --> 02:29.850
"Good Spirit," Scrooge continued,...

02:30.300 --> 02:34.100
..."Tell me that if I change my ways, then my future will be different."

02:34.650 --> 02:38.150
"I will keep Christmas in my heart and try to keep it all year."

02:38.650 --> 02:41.650
"I will live in the past, the present, and the future."

02:42.300 --> 02:45.950
"Oh, tell me that I may clean away the writing on this stone!"

02:46.350 --> 02:52.250
As he spoke, the spirit changed its shape and soon had become one of the posts of his bed.
