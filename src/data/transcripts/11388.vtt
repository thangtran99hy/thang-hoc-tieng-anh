00:01.930 --> 00:07.370
Dorothy lived with her Uncle Henry and Aunt Em on a small farm in Kansas.

00:07.570 --> 00:08.870
Uncle Henry said,...

00:09.110 --> 00:10.610
..."There's a cyclone coming."

00:10.810 --> 00:13.940
Dorothy picked up Toto and ran to the cellar door.

00:14.640 --> 00:19.680
Before she could climb down the ladder into the cellar, a great wind picked up the house.

00:20.150 --> 00:25.250
It turned it round, and round, and round, and then carried it high into the sky.

00:25.590 --> 00:30.260
She was surprised to see three little men and a little woman walking toward her.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.790
"Welcome to the land of the Munchkins,"...

00:33.030 --> 00:34.510
...one of the little men said.

00:34.760 --> 00:40.100
"We thank you for killing the Wicked Witch of the East. Now, our people are free."

00:40.400 --> 00:44.040
She soon came to a cornfield. There was a Scarecrow in it.

00:44.570 --> 00:49.010
She lifted the Scarecrow up and pulled him off the pole, then she said,...

00:49.550 --> 00:52.320
..."Can you tell me the way to the City of Emeralds?"

00:52.680 --> 00:59.120
"I don't know anything, my head is full of straw. I don't have any brains."

00:59.420 --> 01:01.190
"I feel sorry for you,"...

01:01.420 --> 01:02.550
...Dorothy told him.

01:02.960 --> 01:05.430
"If you'll come with me to the Wizard of Oz,...

01:05.660 --> 01:09.660
I'll ask him to help you. Perhaps, he can give you some brains."

01:10.200 --> 01:13.840
Before long, they saw a man standing in front of a tree.

01:14.040 --> 01:19.110
He had an axe beside him, but he was not moving. He was made wholly of tin.

01:19.970 --> 01:24.110
"We are going to visit the Wizard of Oz in the City of Emeralds,"...

01:24.350 --> 01:25.250
...Dorothy said.

01:26.050 --> 01:30.420
"If he is a real wizard, perhaps he can give me a heart,"...

01:30.690 --> 01:31.990
...the Tin Woodman said.

01:32.720 --> 01:38.360
Dorothy, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Woodman continued on their way to the City of Emeralds.

01:38.590 --> 01:42.430
There was a great roar and a Lion ran out of the trees,...

01:42.630 --> 01:46.170
...and with one great paw knocked over the Scarecrow.

01:46.500 --> 01:47.850
Dorothy scolded him.

01:48.070 --> 01:49.840
"You're just a big coward."

01:50.440 --> 01:51.870
The Lion looked down.

01:52.140 --> 01:55.700
"I know I am. Do you think,"...

01:55.910 --> 01:56.900
...the Lion asked,...

01:57.050 --> 01:59.250
..."the wizard could give me courage?"

01:59.420 --> 02:00.480
"It's possible,"...

02:00.680 --> 02:01.680
...Dorothy said.

02:02.120 --> 02:03.850
"Then, may I come with you?"...

02:04.020 --> 02:05.150
...The Lion asked.

02:05.825 --> 02:10.500
Dorothy and her friends were anxious to get out of the forest as soon as they could.

02:10.830 --> 02:13.290
So, they hurried along the yellow brick road.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.660
It was not long before they came to a wide river.

02:17.270 --> 02:19.830
And a few minutes later, they turned a corner,...

02:20.170 --> 02:23.140
...and there in front of them were the gates to the city.

02:23.770 --> 02:25.940
"We want to see the Wizard of Oz,"...

02:26.180 --> 02:27.280
...Dorothy told him.

02:27.910 --> 02:32.310
The Guardian of the Gates led the way through the city to the Palace of Oz.
