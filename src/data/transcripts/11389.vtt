When the Indian Ocean tsunami struck in late 2004,...

00:05.100 --> 00:09.600
...Day wanted to put his experience to use and make a difference in the lives of survivors.

00:10.100 --> 00:13.700
He flew to Sri Lanka to talk with relief organizations about how he could help.

00:13.950 --> 00:14.950
They suggested money.

00:15.450 --> 00:16.850
Day had a better idea.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.400
You can do a large scale bicycle program,...

00:19.750 --> 00:21.300
...the impact would be huge!

00:21.750 --> 00:23.500
So then we selected a partner,...

00:23.700 --> 00:28.600
...and together we delivered 24,400 bikes into Sri Lanka...

00:29.000 --> 00:31.250
...all locally sourced and manufactured.

00:31.500 --> 00:35.200
That experience planted the seed for what became World Bicycle Relief.

00:35.550 --> 00:38.550
Now, Day's charity is focused on Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:38.950 --> 00:45.700
That's essentially what's doing all the shifting internally and used in a more conventional shifter type.

00:46.200 --> 00:51.300
SRAM's expertise has helped World Bicycle Relief put a more durable and affordable bike...

00:51.450 --> 00:55.400
...locally manufactured onto the rugged roads and trails of Zambia.

00:55.900 --> 00:59.050
The nonprofit also trains local mechanics to repair the bikes.

00:59.500 --> 01:04.750
Day says the program has put more than 50,000 bikes into circulation in Zambia.

01:05.150 --> 01:07.400
The rewards for the riders are immediate.

01:07.750 --> 01:10.600
With a bicycle, you can go get fresh water.

01:10.750 --> 01:13.250
With a bicycle, you can go get medical care.

01:13.600 --> 01:17.100
With a bicycle, you can go to your job or find a better job.

01:17.650 --> 01:19.900
So, it doesn't provide you fresh water,...

01:20.150 --> 01:22.500
...but it gives you the ability or the access to it.

01:22.550 --> 01:23.900
And it's all about access.
