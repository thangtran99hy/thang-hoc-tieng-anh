We know what a big star you are in the United States, North America.

00:05.921 --> 00:08.365
Is it comparable in all of these other countries?

00:09.725 --> 00:11.353
It's really fun in other countries.

00:11.995 --> 00:16.253
I love the fans there and we get to play arenas and it's really wonderful and,...

00:18.127 --> 00:21.099
...it's interesting because you go over there and they don't speak the same language as you.

00:21.291 --> 00:25.615
So, I always try to sort of, like, adapt myself a little bit by learning a few phrases.

00:25.716 --> 00:25.807
Right!

00:26.715 --> 00:28.209
I think that's a great thing to do.

00:29.263 --> 00:30.897
Sometimes it fails miserably but like,...

00:33.557 --> 00:38.534
...but like when I'm in Japan, like I just speak in Japanese the entire show.

00:39.078 --> 00:39.951
No, you don't.

00:40.071 --> 00:40.521
Yeah.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.812
I don't sing in Japanese, but I speak in Japanese.

00:43.242 --> 00:48.375
You can actually, you're conversant in Japanese to get through like a 90-minute concert in Japan?

00:48.981 --> 00:52.668
Well, I mean, you just memorize them, and then you figure out what it means.

00:53.493 --> 00:54.068
What do you say?

00:54.269 --> 00:55.325
Like you go like,...

01:05.145 --> 01:05.603
Wow!

01:12.479 --> 01:13.410
What did you say?

01:14.937 --> 01:18.774
First I said, "Are you having fun Osaka," then I said, "I love Japan," then I said,...

01:20.101 --> 01:23.165
..."Japan is awesome," and then I said, "cute".

01:28.230 --> 01:28.447
Well.
