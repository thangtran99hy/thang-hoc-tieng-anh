00:03.300 --> 00:05.470
A wolf saw a lamb in the field.

00:06.300 --> 00:10.370
He wanted to eat him but needed an excuse for killing the young animal.

00:11.170 --> 00:15.650
He went up to the lamb and said, "Last year, you were rude to me."

00:16.680 --> 00:20.320
"I could not have been rude to you last year," the lamb replied.

00:21.020 --> 00:22.380
"I am only a week old."

00:23.220 --> 00:24.920
The wolf thought of another excuse.

00:25.820 --> 00:28.520
"You were eating in my field," he said.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.860
"That's not possible," the lamb said.

00:32.460 --> 00:34.100
"I only drink my mother's milk."

00:35.060 --> 00:37.870
"I'm not going to argue with you," the wolf said.

00:38.400 --> 00:39.840
And he killed the lamb and ate him.
