00:02.000 --> 00:07.840
Once upon a time, there was a little girl whose name was Little Red Riding Hood.

00:08.340 --> 00:12.240
Everyone loved her, but her grandmother loved her most of all.

00:12.810 --> 00:15.280
The grandmother made a red hood for her,...

00:15.510 --> 00:18.380
...and that is how Little Red Riding Hood got her name.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.650
One day, Little Red Riding Hood went to see her grandmother.

00:22.980 --> 00:26.590
As she walked through the forest, she met Mr. Wolf.

00:26.990 --> 00:29.590
"Good morning, little girl."

00:29.890 --> 00:30.660
He said.

00:31.230 --> 00:34.560
"Where are you going on this fine day?"

00:34.900 --> 00:37.370
"I'm going to see my grandmother,"

00:37.630 --> 00:39.270
Little Red Riding Hood said.

00:39.870 --> 00:41.840
"I'm taking her some cakes."

00:42.370 --> 00:44.640
"That's very interesting,"

00:45.270 --> 00:50.380
Mr. Wolf said, and ran off towards Red Riding Hood's grandmother's house.

00:50.710 --> 00:53.450
He came to her house and knocked on the door.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.320
The old lady opened the door.

00:57.690 --> 01:02.320
Immediately, Mr. Wolf ran into the house and ate the old lady.

01:02.660 --> 01:05.760
Then, he put on her clothes and got into her bed.

01:06.530 --> 01:11.830
Soon, Little Red Riding Hood came to her grandmother's house and knocked on the door.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.540
"Hello, Granny."

01:13.870 --> 01:14.900
She called out.

01:15.300 --> 01:17.940
"It's me, Little Red Riding Hood."

01:18.240 --> 01:21.510
Little Red Riding Hood went into her grandmother's house.

01:21.910 --> 01:26.550
She thought she saw her grandmother lying in bed, so she went up to her.

01:27.250 --> 01:31.320
"I can eat you better with a big mouth!"

01:31.620 --> 01:37.130
Mr. Wolf said, and he jumped out of bed and swallowed Little Red Riding Hood.

01:37.490 --> 01:39.960
Then, he lay down and went to sleep.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.960
As he slept, he snored loudly.

01:43.530 --> 01:46.630
Soon, a woodcutter came to the cottage.

01:46.970 --> 01:50.670
He heard snoring, so he opened the door and looked inside.

01:50.940 --> 01:53.600
He saw Mr. Wolf asleep on the bed.

01:54.410 --> 01:56.780
The woodcutter cut open Mr. Wolf.

01:57.180 --> 02:02.620
Immediately, Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother jumped out of the wolf's belly.

02:03.250 --> 02:06.750
The woodcutter filled Mr. Wolf's belly with stones.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.890
Then, Little Red Riding Hood,...

02:09.060 --> 02:13.800
...her grandmother, and the woodcutter sat down together and ate the cakes.
