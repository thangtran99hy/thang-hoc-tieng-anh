00:09.640 --> 00:11.340
There are two ways through life.

00:13.240 --> 00:14.210
The way of nature...

00:15.710 --> 00:16.680
...and the way of grace.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.250
We have to choose which one you'll follow.

00:23.050 --> 00:24.320
Alligator!

00:26.190 --> 00:28.420
You'll be grown before that tree is tall.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.410
It takes fierce will to get ahead in this world.

00:43.000 --> 00:43.770
Come on, hit me!

00:44.270 --> 00:44.570
Hit me!

00:45.240 --> 00:45.880
Come on, son!

00:46.470 --> 00:47.280
He's afraid of you.

00:47.440 --> 00:50.280
You expect things that only an adult can accomplish.

00:50.810 --> 00:53.720
I just always want you to be strong, be your own man.

00:56.890 --> 01:02.360
Father, mother, always you wrestle inside me.

01:05.930 --> 01:07.030
Always you will.

01:09.300 --> 01:11.600
Someday, we'll fall down and weep...

01:13.400 --> 01:14.670
...and you'll understand it all.

01:16.300 --> 01:17.240
All things.

01:29.220 --> 01:29.950
Guide us...

01:31.420 --> 01:32.790
...to the end of time.

01:37.330 --> 01:38.530
Unless you love...

01:42.430 --> 01:44.030
...your life will flash by.
