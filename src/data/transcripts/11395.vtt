00:00.200 --> 00:03.400
The Father, His Sons, and the Sticks.

00:03.900 --> 00:08.240
A father had three sons who were always arguing among themselves.

00:08.870 --> 00:10.570
Nothing he said would stop them,...

00:11.170 --> 00:15.110
...and so one day, he decided to show them something that would make them think.

00:15.880 --> 00:20.220
"Go into the forest," he said, "and bring me back some sticks."

00:21.050 --> 00:24.720
The sons did as he asked and soon came back with some sticks.

00:25.320 --> 00:27.760
He took the sticks from them and tied them together.

00:28.620 --> 00:31.390
"Try to break these sticks in two," he said.

00:31.930 --> 00:35.760
Each of the sons tried to break the sticks in two, but they could not.

00:36.230 --> 00:39.670
"Now try to break the sticks one at a time." he told them.

00:40.370 --> 00:44.070
The sons each took a stick out of the bundle and broke it easily.

00:44.910 --> 00:48.610
"If you all work together and do not quarrel," the father said,...

00:49.110 --> 00:54.320
..."You will be strong. If each of you go your own way, you will be weak."
