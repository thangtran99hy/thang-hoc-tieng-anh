A wolf had a bone stuck in his throat and it hurt very much.

00:08.070 --> 00:11.840
The wolf asked a bird to use her beak and pull the bone out.

00:12.540 --> 00:15.110
He promised to pay the bird when the bone was out.

00:15.880 --> 00:18.850
The bird did as he was asked and pulled the bone out.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.550
Then, she asked for the promised payment.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.990
"I'm not going to pay you," the wolf said.

00:25.650 --> 00:28.790
"You're lucky I didn't eat you when you had your head in my mouth!"

00:29.630 --> 00:30.630
Then, he ran off.
