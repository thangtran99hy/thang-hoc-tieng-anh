00:01.050 --> 00:03.100
There are six and a half billion people in the world...

00:03.500 --> 00:05.050
...but we all look the same when we lie.

00:05.700 --> 00:09.200
Dilated pupils, oblique eyebrows, an upturned lip.

00:10.050 --> 00:11.700
The smallest line on your face,...

00:12.250 --> 00:13.450
...the slightest body movement,...

00:14.300 --> 00:15.350
...it all tells a story.

00:16.050 --> 00:20.550
It may be human nature to lie but the truth is written all over your face.

00:23.900 --> 00:27.500
Lie to Me premieres this January on Fox.
