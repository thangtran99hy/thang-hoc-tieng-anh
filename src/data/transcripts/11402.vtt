00:02.160 --> 00:07.500
One day, three friends: Antonio, Pablo, and José left their village.

00:08.600 --> 00:14.110
"We will go different ways and meet here one year from today," Antonio said.

00:14.440 --> 00:18.080
Soon, Pablo met an old woman sitting by the side of the road.

00:18.680 --> 00:21.920
Pablo did not have much money, but he gave her some.

00:22.420 --> 00:26.090
She opened an old bag and took out a small carpet.

00:26.720 --> 00:32.330
"This carpet," the old woman said, "is a magic carpet."

00:32.660 --> 00:37.270
"It will take you wherever you ask it to. Please take it."

00:38.070 --> 00:41.370
At about this time, Antonio met a poor, old man.

00:41.840 --> 00:44.240
Antonio sat down beside the old man.

00:44.970 --> 00:49.580
"Eat with me," he said. He gave half of his food to the old man.

00:50.150 --> 00:52.380
He took an old book out of his pocket.

00:52.950 --> 00:58.990
"This book is very old," he said, "but it is a magic book."

00:59.290 --> 01:04.630
"Hold it in your hand, ask it any question, let it fall open."

01:04.990 --> 01:09.230
"It will fall open to the page that has the answer to your question."

01:10.000 --> 01:13.550
At about this time, José also met an old man.

01:14.010 --> 01:17.170
The man did not have a coat and he was very cold.

01:18.040 --> 01:21.010
So, he took off his coat and gave it to the old man.

01:21.610 --> 01:23.650
He took a flute out of his pocket.

01:24.220 --> 01:27.520
"This is a magic flute," he said.

01:28.450 --> 01:32.720
"Play it to a sick person and he or she will get better."

01:33.560 --> 01:38.430
A year later, the three friends met again. Antonio was the first to speak.

01:38.660 --> 01:40.860
He told his friends about his magic book.

01:41.530 --> 01:45.200
José said, "Can your book tell us who is very sick?"

01:45.870 --> 01:48.870
The book fell open to a picture of the king's daughter.

01:49.340 --> 01:51.770
The three friends stepped onto the magic carpet.

01:52.110 --> 01:54.140
They soon arrived at the king's palace.

01:54.340 --> 01:57.980
"If you can cure my daughter," the king said,...

01:58.450 --> 02:03.790
"...then you may marry her. If you do not cure her, you will go to prison."

02:04.490 --> 02:07.920
José stood by the princess's bed and played the magic flute.

02:08.360 --> 02:11.760
Within minutes, she was sitting up in bed asking for food.

02:12.290 --> 02:16.970
"My daughter is cured!" The king said. "You may marry her."

02:17.700 --> 02:19.430
José and the princess were married.

02:20.500 --> 02:25.030
The king, who was very old, asked José to take his place as the new king.

02:25.470 --> 02:28.110
This he did and he was a good and wise king.
