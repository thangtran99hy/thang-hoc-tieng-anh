James Balog photographs disappearing glaciers in the most remote regions of the planet.

00:08.488 --> 00:12.453
There's this transition from, you know, having this shape...

00:12.586 --> 00:15.165
...and having a reality to going away....

00:15.314 --> 00:19.393
...somewhere in there in that boundary between life and death,...

00:19.797 --> 00:21.078
...it's where the story will be.

00:21.871 --> 00:24.431
That story is in the Extreme Ice Survey,...

00:24.851 --> 00:28.733
...a project that Balog founded and has directed since 2006.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.623
His idea was to install cameras on glaciers...

00:31.692 --> 00:35.003
...in Greenland, Iceland, Alaska, and the Rocky Mountains...

00:35.330 --> 00:38.183
...and shoot pictures remotely during daylight hours.

00:38.784 --> 00:42.765
That adds up to about 4500 pictures a year for each camera.

00:43.470 --> 00:47.477
Balog says from the very first downloads, he was stunned by what he saw,...

00:48.064 --> 00:51.091
...especially when played back as continuous video.

00:51.637 --> 00:54.846
Your jaw drops sometimes, you go, "You mean that happened?"

00:55.211 --> 00:59.393
"In the past two months, that happened during that one week? You gotta be kidding."

01:00.113 --> 01:01.248
"How is this possible?"

01:01.727 --> 01:03.119
And so just in general,...

01:03.564 --> 01:08.265
...this rate of landscape evolution, of these huge features that you consider to be,...

01:08.687 --> 01:12.979
...monumental, powerful, enduring, immortal parts of the landscape,...

01:13.363 --> 01:16.387
...when you see them disappearing in a very short period of time,...

01:16.459 --> 01:17.939
...it really alters your sense of time.
