Will it blend? That is the question.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.850
I am on cloud nine.

00:19.350 --> 00:22.100
I just got this cool, new Chrome Notebook.

00:22.500 --> 00:26.800
What's so special is no matter what you do to this computer,...

00:27.200 --> 00:30.100
...the work that you've done will be saved somewhere else.

00:30.300 --> 00:31.250
Let me demonstrate.

00:31.650 --> 00:36.350
Now obviously, the Chrome Notebook won't fit in the Blendtec Total Blender.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.600
We've had this problem before.

00:46.150 --> 00:48.300
I think I'm going to press the delete button.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.400
Whoa! Chrome smoke.

01:21.750 --> 01:24.050
Let's hope you never have to breathe this.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.100
Even though my notebook went up in smoke, my information is still safe in the cloud.

01:33.300 --> 01:34.850
I wonder where the cloud is.
