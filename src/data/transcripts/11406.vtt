00:11.700 --> 00:16.500
The United States and Russia hold over 90% of the world's nuclear weapons.

00:16.700 --> 00:21.500
A strategic nuclear missile launched from the United States can hit Russia in about 30 minutes.

00:21.600 --> 00:24.800
Russian missiles can go just as far, just as fast.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.750
Efforts between the two countries to negotiate the limits on these kinds of weapons...

00:29.050 --> 00:30.600
...go back to the end of the cold war.

00:31.150 --> 00:32.600
When Ronald Reagan became president,...

00:33.000 --> 00:35.296
...he put the emphasis not just on limiting nuclear arms,...

00:35.370 --> 00:36.967
...but actually beginning the reductions.

00:37.050 --> 00:42.400
Reagan and Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987,...

00:42.650 --> 00:46.250
....eliminating an entire class of intermediate-range nuclear missiles.

00:46.750 --> 00:51.600
Just as importantly, the treaty allowed each side to inspect the other's facilities...

00:51.950 --> 00:53.850
...to make sure the other side wasn't cheating.

00:54.100 --> 01:01.300
"Doveryai, no proveryai." That is a proverb in Russia that says, "Trust, but verify."

01:02.850 --> 01:07.100
START I, signed by President George Herbert Walker Bush and Gorbachev...

01:07.400 --> 01:13.200
...resulted in the removal of about 80% of all strategic nuclear weapons then in existence.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.950
START I expired in December of last year.

01:16.033 --> 01:16.866
In April of this year,...

01:16.941 --> 01:21.240
...the New START agreement was signed by President Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev.

01:21.800 --> 01:27.650
The United States and Russia have agreed to the most comprehensive arms control agreement in nearly two decades.

01:27.750 --> 01:32.300
Both countries will reduce their supplies of long-range nuclear weapons by roughly 1/3...

01:32.650 --> 01:35.300
...from 2,200 to 1,550 each.

01:35.650 --> 01:38.700
"Not so fast," say Republican leaders in the US Congress.

01:39.050 --> 01:44.050
They say this agreement could threaten US plans for a missile defense system based in Europe.

01:44.700 --> 01:49.500
The New START treaty has to get through the US Senate by a 2/3 majority vote,...

01:49.550 --> 01:52.450
...that means 67 senators have to vote "Yes."

01:52.900 --> 01:57.300
For the United States, getting rid of some nuclear weapons would seem like a sure thing.

01:57.800 --> 01:58.350
But it isn't.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.300
Why? Now, you know.
