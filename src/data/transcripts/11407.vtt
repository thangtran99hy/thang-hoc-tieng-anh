00:02.500 --> 00:05.000
My first master was a kind man.

00:05.300 --> 00:07.600
My mother and I had a happy life.

00:08.200 --> 00:11.650
One day, my master sold me to Squire Gordon.

00:12.300 --> 00:15.200
"You're a beautiful horse," he said.

00:15.650 --> 00:18.250
"You have a beautiful black coat."

00:18.450 --> 00:20.850
"I shall call you Black Beauty."

00:21.750 --> 00:25.800
I learned to carry my master on my back and pull a cart.

00:26.350 --> 00:28.150
The coachman's name was John.

00:28.700 --> 00:31.800
One night, John had to take a letter to a doctor.

00:32.100 --> 00:34.100
The squire's wife was very ill.

00:34.800 --> 00:37.500
"Wake up, Beauty!" he said to me.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.100
He jumped onto my back.

00:39.550 --> 00:42.050
"Run as fast as you can," he said.

00:42.300 --> 00:44.250
"Mrs. Gordon is very sick."

00:44.350 --> 00:45.600
"She needs a doctor."

00:46.400 --> 00:48.000
I ran as fast as I could.

00:48.300 --> 00:49.600
We soon came to town.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.200
John woke up the doctor.

00:51.600 --> 00:52.700
He gave him the letter.

00:53.050 --> 00:55.600
"Ride Black Beauty," John said.

00:56.200 --> 00:59.000
"He is tired, but he will run as fast as he can."

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
The doctor was heavier than John, but I did my best.

01:03.350 --> 01:05.100
I carried the doctor to the house.

01:05.400 --> 01:06.400
Then I lay down.

01:06.750 --> 01:07.800
I could not breathe.

01:08.150 --> 01:09.100
I was in pain.

01:09.700 --> 01:12.650
I was very sick for a long time.

01:13.350 --> 01:15.300
Mr. Gordon often came to see me.

01:16.150 --> 01:19.450
"My beautiful horse," he said to me.

01:19.800 --> 01:22.200
"You saved Mrs. Gordon's life."
