00:19.020 --> 00:22.150
I come before you because I need my authority reinstated.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.020
This was a vampire attack.

00:27.420 --> 00:28.290
Get her down below!

00:28.420 --> 00:30.290
Whatever you hear, don't scream.

00:36.500 --> 00:40.270
The citizens have complete faith in the Church's ability to keep them safe.

00:43.240 --> 00:45.110
You will not shake that faith.

00:45.410 --> 00:47.280
What good is that faith when it's a lie.

00:47.810 --> 00:51.910
If you take any action to leave the city, you will be stripped from the order,...

00:52.110 --> 00:53.920
...and excommunicated immediately.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.020
The war is long over.

01:00.220 --> 01:01.220
It's not over.

01:02.220 --> 01:02.960
Not for me.

01:13.670 --> 01:15.570
Is this the world that I fought for?

01:15.900 --> 01:18.070
No, but it's the only world we have left.

01:19.140 --> 01:21.880
One of your own has broken his sacred vow.

01:21.980 --> 01:23.900
You will find him dead or alive.

01:25.780 --> 01:26.980
They bred a new army.

01:30.150 --> 01:32.820
You are too late priest, this is their turn now.

02:05.260 --> 02:08.060
Is it true what they say about priests? They wield the hand of God?

02:14.500 --> 02:16.600
You have no idea what's coming priest.
