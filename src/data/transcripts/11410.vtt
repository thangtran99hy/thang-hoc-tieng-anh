My name is Camila Batmanghelidjh. I'm a psychotherapist and the founder of Kids Company,...

00:20.580 --> 00:23.920
...a charity supporting 14,000 vulnerable children,...

00:24.150 --> 00:27.350
...and this is See Britain through my eyes.

00:32.500 --> 00:37.770
When we first started, we were a handful of people in some railway arches.

00:38.830 --> 00:41.870
It was 100 adolescent boys from different gangs...

00:42.040 --> 00:46.810
...and I used to just stand here, and kinda take a deep breath, and say, "Welcome,...

00:47.110 --> 00:49.950
...please don't spit." And they used to get their knives out,...

00:50.220 --> 00:55.020
...rip the furniture, set the cushions alight, stick their chewing gums in places.

00:55.580 --> 01:00.190
But as time went on, I got to know them and they started coming and talking to me,...

01:00.420 --> 01:07.960
...and it's just in this little railway arch, I heard 400 of the most horrific stories...

01:08.130 --> 01:10.100
...of what had happened to these children.

01:14.040 --> 01:20.400
So, we quietly, gently, and eccentrically grew to a big organization.

01:21.080 --> 01:25.010
Now, we've got a five story building as our head office.

01:25.380 --> 01:33.150
We're on 40 different sites, 6,000 volunteers, 14,000 children who are being helped,...

01:33.490 --> 01:37.900
...a budget of 12 million and this is all thanks to the British public...

01:38.100 --> 01:44.100
...because every brick of Kids Company was built on the compassion of the British public.

01:45.930 --> 01:53.020
What we do at Kids Company is that we function like a substitute parent in the lives of these children.

01:53.980 --> 01:58.600
Some of the children are so disturbed and traumatized...

01:58.950 --> 02:03.950
...that we need to untangle the trauma before they can go on to flourish.

02:05.790 --> 02:11.790
When I was nine years old in Iran, I told my parents that I wanted to start an orphanage,...

02:12.360 --> 02:15.660
...but then the revolution happened in Iran, and I ended up in England.

02:16.200 --> 02:18.040
I had to get political asylum.

02:18.330 --> 02:25.470
Even though I had significant damage to my brain because of being born very premature,...

02:25.710 --> 02:28.210
...I walked out of Warwick with a first-class degree,...

02:28.580 --> 02:30.850
...which then opened all the other doors.

02:31.310 --> 02:36.050
So now, I have six secretaries and I don't care if I can't spell.
