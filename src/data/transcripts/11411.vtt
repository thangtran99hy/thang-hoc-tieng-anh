In this age of the Internet, there are spies all over the place...

00:05.150 --> 00:09.500
...tracking every move you make and every step you take on the World Wide Web.

00:09.750 --> 00:11.700
It's called behavioral marketing.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.800
Websites, Internet advertising agencies, Internet data collectors,...

00:16.150 --> 00:19.000
...all using technology to see where you go, what you like...

00:19.100 --> 00:23.300
...and, most importantly, what you might want to buy as you cruise the Web.

00:23.500 --> 00:27.050
Websites drop what are called cookies into a visitor's computer.

00:27.250 --> 00:33.750
This cookie is really the technology that tracks us as we click around within a website and as we move from site to site.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.750
This detailed information is blended into customer profiles...

00:37.800 --> 00:42.400
...and used mostly by Internet advertising networks to target consumers.

00:42.633 --> 00:45.654
But critics say way too much personal information is collected...

00:45.740 --> 00:49.346
...that can, among other things, expose the web surfer's identity.

00:49.550 --> 00:53.500
Cookie-generated data is also gathered by data collection companies.

00:53.550 --> 00:57.050
The information is packaged into millions of customer profiles...

00:57.100 --> 01:00.550
...then grouped, bundled and sold to advertising networks.

01:00.600 --> 01:06.000
Critics say this cookie-generated information may be used in a way that hurts the web surfer.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.813
Ad networks and websites say they voluntarily follow regulations...

01:09.886 --> 01:12.341
...that prohibit the sharing of private information,...

01:12.550 --> 01:15.500
...especially data on your health or your finances.

01:15.900 --> 01:19.632
And they say their, as yet, still evolving self-regulatory program...

01:19.853 --> 01:21.946
...will allow web surfers a choice.

01:22.100 --> 01:26.900
Instead of opting out, critics say web surfers should have the choice to opt in.

01:27.300 --> 01:32.100
Opt in, opt out, it really doesn't matter because people can blow off these spy cookies...

01:32.150 --> 01:36.450
...just by adjusting their privacy settings on their web browsers.

01:36.750 --> 01:38.500
Critics say it's just not that easy,...

01:38.550 --> 01:42.350
...there are Flash cookies and super cookies that get around browser settings.

01:42.750 --> 01:47.550
They say the best bet to protect privacy on the Internet is reasonable government regulation.

01:47.950 --> 01:50.200
Until then, well, it's up to you.

01:50.850 --> 01:52.950
