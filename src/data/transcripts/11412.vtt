00:03.500 --> 00:08.300
One cold winter's day, the ants were drying the corn they had collected in the summer.

00:09.350 --> 00:13.150
A grasshopper came to the ants and asked them for a little food.

00:13.850 --> 00:17.500
He was hungry because he could not find any corn growing in the fields.

00:18.500 --> 00:22.500
The ants asked him, "Why didn't you put some corn aside for the winter..."

00:22.750 --> 00:25.100
"...during the summer when there was plenty in the fields?"

00:26.050 --> 00:28.950
The grasshopper replied, "I didn't have time."

00:29.500 --> 00:30.600
"I was busy singing."

00:31.600 --> 00:33.250
The ants all laughed at him and said,...

00:33.900 --> 00:36.100
"If you were foolish enough to sing all summer,..."

00:36.600 --> 00:38.700
"...then you must go to bed hungry in the winter."
