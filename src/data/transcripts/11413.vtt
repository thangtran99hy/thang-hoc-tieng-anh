How to Read Someone's Mind: A Simple Card Trick.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.600
You don't have to be a psychic to read someone's mind...

00:10.000 --> 00:12.400
...or at least, to make them think you're reading their mind.

00:13.300 --> 00:17.400
You will need three playing cards, one with a large "X" written on the back,...

00:17.950 --> 00:22.250
...an envelope with the words "You will choose" and the name of the second card written on it,...

00:22.650 --> 00:24.050
...a duplicate of the third card,...

00:24.450 --> 00:25.550
...and a flat surface.

00:27.350 --> 00:32.300
Step one: Before your audience arrives, tuck the duplicate card into the bottom of the envelope...

00:32.550 --> 00:35.450
...and fold the envelope over so the side with the writing is covered.

00:35.850 --> 00:39.050
Now, put the three cards into the top part of the folded envelope,...

00:39.300 --> 00:41.150
...and stick the whole package in your pocket.

00:42.050 --> 00:45.850
Step two: In front of your audience, pull the envelope out of your pocket...

00:45.950 --> 00:48.800
...and quickly put it writing side down on the surface.

00:49.150 --> 00:52.250
Boast that it's really not all that hard to read someone's mind.

00:53.650 --> 00:57.900
Step three: Quickly pull just the three cards out of the top part of the envelope...

00:58.100 --> 00:59.800
...and place them face up on the table.

01:00.400 --> 01:04.000
Make sure the spectator doesn't see the "X" on the back of the one card.

01:04.850 --> 01:08.650
Step four: Ask an audience member to tap on the card of their choice.

01:09.250 --> 01:13.075
Build suspense by asking if they're sure they want that card.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.000
Offer to allow them to pick another.

01:16.500 --> 01:19.650
Step five: No matter which card they finally settle on,...

01:19.900 --> 01:23.050
...tell them you knew they'd choose it and then prove it.

01:23.400 --> 01:27.650
If they chose the card with the "X", flip it over and reveal your prediction mark.

01:27.900 --> 01:32.550
If they chose the second card, flip over the envelope to reveal your written prediction.

01:32.900 --> 01:37.900
If they chose the third card, reach into the envelope and pull out the proof that you read their mind.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.400
The same card!

01:39.900 --> 01:43.350
Now, quick! Start another trick before they figure out how you pulled it off.

01:45.350 --> 01:50.050
Did you know, magicians who specialize in mind reading are known as mentalists?
