There are often homeless people asking for change in freeway exit ramps.

00:04.309 --> 00:09.116
But recently, there's been this guy with an interesting sign at I-71 and Hudson Street.

00:09.715 --> 00:15.054
His handwritten sign says he has the God-given gift of a great voice.

00:15.585 --> 00:17.399
Hey, I'm gonna make you work for your dollar.

00:17.700 --> 00:19.136
Say something with that great radio voice.

00:19.208 --> 00:23.731
When you're listening to nothing but the best of oldies, you're listening to Magic 98.9.

00:24.711 --> 00:26.805
Thank you so much, God bless you.

00:27.297 --> 00:27.850
Thank you.

00:28.203 --> 00:30.599
And we'll be back with more right after these words.

00:32.797 --> 00:35.501
And don't forget tomorrow morning is your chance to win a pair of tickets...

00:35.581 --> 00:37.627
...to see this man live in concert.

00:39.182 --> 00:40.375
Thank you so much.

00:40.807 --> 00:43.599
Well, when I was 14 years old, I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York.

00:43.747 --> 00:48.008
When I was 14, I kind of listened to one of our area radio announcers,...

00:48.567 --> 00:51.695
...and I went on a field trip to go meet the guy...

00:52.073 --> 00:54.745
...and he looked nothing like what he sounded like.

00:54.873 --> 01:00.825
So, I asked him about that and he said to me, "Listen, radio is defined theater of mind."

01:01.676 --> 01:03.033
And so, when he said theater of mind,...

01:03.100 --> 01:07.168
...I just said, "Well, hey, I can't be an actor, I can't be an on-air personality."

01:07.263 --> 01:11.469
But the voice just became something of a development over the years...

01:11.539 --> 01:12.594
...and I went to school for it.

01:13.237 --> 01:16.905
And then, alcohol and drugs and a few other things became a part of my life.

01:17.867 --> 01:19.040
I got two years clean.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.595
And I'm trying hard to get it back...

01:21.685 --> 01:24.425
...and hopefully somebody from one of these television or radio stations,...

01:24.500 --> 01:27.317
..."Hey, I need a voice over or a, I need something."

01:28.338 --> 01:30.390
So, you know, I'm hoping one day,...

01:31.202 --> 01:34.155
..."Watch Family Guy weeknights at 7:30 on Fox 28."

01:34.521 --> 01:37.336
Anything, but that's what it is and I love radio.
