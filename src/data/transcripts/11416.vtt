A hare is an animal that can run very fast.

00:06.300 --> 00:10.210
A tortoise is an animal that can move only very slowly.

00:10.780 --> 00:15.320
One day, a hare laughed at a tortoise that was moving slowly past him.

00:16.110 --> 00:19.850
The tortoise, who did not like being laughed at because he was slow,...

00:20.280 --> 00:26.390
...said to the hare, "Although you can run faster than I, I will beat you in a race."

00:27.220 --> 00:33.700
The hare, thinking that the tortoise could not do this, said, "Very well, I will race you."

00:34.630 --> 00:37.300
The two animals asked a fox to be the judge...

00:37.570 --> 00:39.370
...and to choose the place for the race.

00:40.100 --> 00:41.270
On the day of the race,...

00:41.570 --> 00:45.740
...the fox told the animals where the race would begin and where it would end.

00:46.640 --> 00:54.280
The fox then said, "One, two, three, go!" And the race began.

00:55.080 --> 00:58.950
The hare ran off and was soon a long way in front of the tortoise.

01:00.020 --> 01:05.350
He was so far in front that he stopped running to have a rest and soon fell asleep.

01:06.230 --> 01:10.100
The tortoise, however, just kept on moving slowly forward.

01:10.970 --> 01:14.470
When the hare woke up, he saw that the tortoise had passed him...

01:14.940 --> 01:17.010
...and was now a long way in front of him.

01:17.870 --> 01:21.210
He ran as fast as he could to catch up and pass the tortoise.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.550
But before he could do this,...

01:23.910 --> 01:27.020
...the fox judged the tortoise to be the winner of the race.
