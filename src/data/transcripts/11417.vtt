00:34.150 --> 00:36.650
Of course, as an architect, I'm interested in houses...

00:36.900 --> 00:39.200
...and traditionally in England that's how they look like.

00:40.200 --> 00:43.400
They all look similar with very thick walls to keep the cold out...

00:43.500 --> 00:45.200
...and you can't tell much from the outside.

00:45.800 --> 00:50.250
That's a little bit the preconception I have of British people: cold and reserved.

00:50.850 --> 00:52.900
But actually, people are quite warm.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.000
I was working as an architect back in Brazil...

01:09.050 --> 01:11.700
...and I always wanted to work with sustainable architecture,...

01:11.900 --> 01:14.950
...and I couldn't find a course that was as good as the one I found here.

01:15.950 --> 01:18.350
England was more inviting in many ways.

01:18.800 --> 01:23.750
It's a very international country where everyone meets, where other worlds meet.

01:24.850 --> 01:31.750
I arrived towards the end of 2004, found everything so different from what I expected and never left.

01:34.300 --> 01:37.650
British people and the British society are quite traditional in many ways,...

01:38.000 --> 01:41.450
...but it's also a step forward in many other ways.

01:41.500 --> 01:45.850
So, for example, for energy efficiency in housing, it's a step ahead of everyone.

01:46.300 --> 01:52.800
The government is now trying to push into having all the new houses in Britain should be zero carbon by 2016...

01:53.150 --> 01:54.600
...and that's just six years from now.

01:54.700 --> 01:57.650
That's very close and that's a huge challenge.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.800
It's one of the things we're trying to address here.
