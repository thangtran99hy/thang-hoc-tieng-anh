00:06.750 --> 00:08.850
What I do requires a certain mindset.

00:11.750 --> 00:12.800
I do assignments.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.400
Some jobs need to look like accidents.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.900
The best jobs are the ones nobody even knows you're there.

00:25.300 --> 00:26.700
There's no one better than you, you know.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.250
You need someone to watch your back.

00:30.450 --> 00:31.300
I have you, Harry.

00:34.550 --> 00:36.250
Harry McKenna sold this company out.

00:36.950 --> 00:38.050
He had to be removed.

00:43.050 --> 00:44.250
Sorry about your father.

00:46.000 --> 00:46.900
I wanna know what you know.

00:48.400 --> 00:48.850
Follow me.

00:50.500 --> 00:51.400
Know what a mechanic is?

00:52.450 --> 00:53.400
A hitman.

00:54.950 --> 00:56.700
Now, to take your training to the next level.

01:01.750 --> 01:02.750
So what's the plan now?

01:03.700 --> 01:04.900
Time to finish the job.

01:14.400 --> 01:15.600
Those were my best teams.

01:16.200 --> 01:17.150
Guess I'll have to send more.

01:18.000 --> 01:18.700
Save the fuel.

01:20.100 --> 01:20.900
We're coming for you.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.800
You think you can get to me before I get to you?

01:27.400 --> 01:28.500
I already have.

01:28.550 --> 01:28.800
Do it.
