00:19.720 --> 00:22.350
I'm an Australian and I'm an artist.

00:24.090 --> 00:25.120
I'm a composer.

00:27.920 --> 00:31.140
I've lived in the UK for the last four years.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.330
I came here to do a job.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.500
I'm the Director of the Edinburgh International Festival.

00:41.310 --> 00:43.360
There seems to be a common perception,...

00:44.080 --> 00:48.310
...let's not beat around the bush, that the UK is up-itself.

00:55.450 --> 00:58.550
I'm here to tell you that nothing could be further from the truth.

00:59.320 --> 01:04.860
This is an incredibly diverse, incredibly welcoming meritocracy.

01:05.860 --> 01:10.530
Edinburgh in August is, I think, a great example of what the UK can do...

01:10.930 --> 01:14.240
...and do very well: let its hair down.

01:15.970 --> 01:19.620
The Edinburgh Festival was started to offer people hope...

01:19.920 --> 01:25.050
...at a time that had been seen to be so hopeless after the Second World War.

01:29.380 --> 01:36.020
In 1947, the Edinburgh Festival started when the landscape in Europe was horrific.

01:36.790 --> 01:41.900
There was no town, no part of Europe that had been unscathed by the bombing.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.170
It couldn't be held in Coventry, it couldn't be held in Manchester,...

01:46.470 --> 01:53.480
...it couldn't be held in Birmingham or London because the places were bombed to blazes.

01:58.050 --> 02:01.650
Edinburgh stages Scotland's first international music and drama festival.

02:01.750 --> 02:04.420
I think one of the reasons it was so successful...

02:04.720 --> 02:08.160
...was that not only did people open their minds...

02:08.390 --> 02:14.200
...and receive really interesting culture from places they'd hardly ever heard of, let alone been to.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.970
2,000 artists taking part in a total of 174 performances.

02:18.070 --> 02:21.460
But most important of all, they opened their hearts.

02:23.070 --> 02:27.040
And there was the most extraordinary sense that we should share what we have.

02:27.510 --> 02:30.480
We should share our food, we should share our shelter.

02:31.080 --> 02:35.150
But perhaps most important of all, we should share our culture.
