Sega.

00:11.170 --> 00:14.110
This is a dark time in the history of Japan.

00:15.310 --> 00:19.620
For over 200 years, the Ashikaga shogunate has ruled the country.

00:20.550 --> 00:22.020
But when its power failed,...

00:22.350 --> 00:27.020
...Japan's greatest and most ruthless warlords could no longer be contained.

00:28.720 --> 00:33.530
In 1477, the Onin War led to the fall of the old shogun...

00:36.560 --> 00:40.210
...as thousands of brave samurais spilled the blood of their brothers...

00:40.440 --> 00:42.640
...on the once peaceful islands of Japan.

00:43.810 --> 00:46.800
Giant vessels battle to control the raging seas.

00:48.640 --> 00:50.150
The land is divided.

00:51.580 --> 00:52.820
The people suffer.

00:53.850 --> 00:56.180
The soul of a country begins to die.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.290
Ten legendary leaders will strive for supremacy...

01:02.160 --> 01:05.360
...but only one will rise above all to crush his foes...

01:05.690 --> 01:08.630
...and govern the nation as the new shogun.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.300
Japan can be ruled completely by only one man.

01:13.870 --> 01:17.410
A great warrior, a great wisdom, a great leader.

01:19.040 --> 01:22.780
Now is your time to master the techniques your forefathers have given you.

01:23.510 --> 01:25.780
Now is your time to overcome all opposition...

01:26.250 --> 01:27.380
...to become shogun.

01:28.580 --> 01:31.390
Now is the time for total war.
