00:02.700 --> 00:05.650
One night, a little swallow flew over the city.

00:06.300 --> 00:08.800
He was in love with the most beautiful reed.

00:09.650 --> 00:12.000
"Will you come away with me?" He asked her.

00:12.350 --> 00:13.600
The reed shook her head.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.100
She wanted to stay at home in the river.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.200
"Then, I shall leave you," the swallow said.

00:19.550 --> 00:21.600
"Goodbye!" And he flew away.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.100
All day long he flew and at nighttime, he arrived at the city.

00:26.700 --> 00:30.500
Then, he saw the statue of the Happy Prince in the center of the town.

00:30.950 --> 00:32.800
"I will stay there," he said.

00:33.150 --> 00:35.450
"It is a good place with plenty of clean air."

00:36.050 --> 00:39.550
The Happy Prince's face was so beautiful in the moonlight...

00:39.700 --> 00:42.650
...that the little swallow was filled with sadness for him.

00:43.200 --> 00:47.650
They were filled with tears and tears were running down his golden face.

00:48.250 --> 00:49.900
"Who are you?" He said.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.200
"I am the Happy Prince."

00:52.850 --> 00:55.550
"Why are you crying then?" Asked the swallow.

00:56.100 --> 00:59.300
"When I was alive and had a heart," answered the statue,...

00:59.550 --> 01:01.500
..."I did not know what tears were."

01:02.300 --> 01:05.600
"Now that I am dead, they have put me up so high...

01:05.750 --> 01:09.700
...that I can see all the ugliness and all the unhappiness in my city."

01:10.250 --> 01:12.150
"That is making me cry."

01:12.750 --> 01:15.300
"Far away," continued the statue,...

01:15.600 --> 01:18.200
..."in a little street, there is a poor house."

01:18.950 --> 01:21.100
"I can see a woman sitting at a table."

01:21.450 --> 01:27.900
"Her face is thin and her hands hurt because she works all day sewing clothes for rich women to wear."

01:28.250 --> 01:31.800
"In a bed in the corner of the room, her little boy is sick."

01:32.300 --> 01:36.300
"Little swallow, will you please take her the jewel from the top of my sword?"

01:36.800 --> 01:40.800
The Happy Prince looked so sad that the little swallow was sad, too.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.400
"It is very cold here," he said,...

01:43.750 --> 01:47.150
..."but I will stay with you for one night, and do as you ask."
