00:04.930 --> 00:05.600
Did you sleep?

00:06.000 --> 00:07.940
No, I'll sleep at the hotel.

00:08.610 --> 00:09.540
Welcome to Berlin.

00:12.540 --> 00:14.740
Can you tell me what you remember?

00:16.350 --> 00:17.250
I was in a taxi.

00:19.650 --> 00:20.320
I crashed.

00:21.550 --> 00:22.920
I don't know how I got here.

00:23.320 --> 00:25.190
You have been in a coma for four days.

00:25.950 --> 00:28.660
We couldn't find any identification with you.

00:29.160 --> 00:29.960
What's your name?

00:31.030 --> 00:32.690
I'm Dr. Martin Harris.

00:35.260 --> 00:38.500
I've been gone for four days. My wife is out there in a city she doesn't know.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.640
Excuse me sir. Do you have an invitation?

00:40.740 --> 00:41.870
That's my wife over there.

00:42.700 --> 00:43.170
Liz.

00:43.940 --> 00:44.640
Do I know you?

00:45.270 --> 00:46.610
What's wrong? It's me,...

00:48.440 --> 00:49.110
...your husband.

00:49.710 --> 00:50.310
Martin.

00:52.180 --> 00:54.080
You are Dr. Martin Harris?

00:54.250 --> 00:55.220
Last time I looked.

00:56.250 --> 00:57.450
Is this some kind of a joke?

00:57.750 --> 00:58.520
You know this man?

00:58.950 --> 00:59.290
No.

00:59.590 --> 00:59.750
Liz.

00:59.850 --> 01:00.590
Get him out of here.

01:00.890 --> 01:02.160
Liz, Liz.

01:03.830 --> 01:06.560
There are no rules with severe trauma of this kind.

01:07.260 --> 01:09.030
Memories get lost or fractured.

01:09.130 --> 01:12.330
I'm not crazy. Somewhere there's proof I'm me.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.040
I was in your taxi. We crashed.

01:19.240 --> 01:20.180
How did you find me?

01:20.380 --> 01:21.680
I need to know what happened.

01:22.980 --> 01:25.580
It's not safe for you. There are people watching.

01:30.520 --> 01:34.930
They had me convinced I was crazy, but when they came to take me, I knew.

01:37.330 --> 01:38.490
It's a simple code.

01:38.760 --> 01:40.200
These mean anything to you?

01:41.030 --> 01:42.230
It's my wife's writing.

01:45.930 --> 01:48.840
They have passports, credit cards, family photos.

01:49.770 --> 01:51.310
You really don't remember anything.

01:51.710 --> 01:52.840
Get your hands off me.

01:56.980 --> 01:59.450
Who are these people? They can become anyone.

02:00.500 --> 02:03.590
The question is why would they want to take your place.

02:04.850 --> 02:10.020
I don't know who this man is, but you have to arrest him or many people will die.

02:11.190 --> 02:12.690
There is no Martin Harris.

02:13.460 --> 02:14.830
He doesn't exist.

02:16.570 --> 02:17.930
I am Martin Harris.

02:20.870 --> 02:22.010
I didn't forget everything.
