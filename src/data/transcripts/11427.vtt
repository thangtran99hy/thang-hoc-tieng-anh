I've always wanted to be in the Guinness Book of World Records since I was a small child.

00:17.650 --> 00:19.720
In fact, I made a list of ten things I had to do before I die...

00:19.820 --> 00:21.290
...and this was one of the things I had to do.

00:21.520 --> 00:24.750
The greatest thing about Guinness World Records is the way they celebrate people's uniqueness,...

00:24.850 --> 00:28.160
...and then everybody has one special freak skill and this just happens to be mine.

00:31.790 --> 00:33.500
I've been doing balloons since I was a very small child.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.000
I received a small kit. It was a balloon modeling kit.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.740
My family, I think they're still hoping it's a phase but it's long past that.

00:42.890 --> 00:45.610
I have been doing it for such a long time and it's wonderful.

00:56.650 --> 01:00.520
The reason people are constantly trying to break records is they wanna be able to feel special.

01:00.620 --> 01:02.820
Every single person in this world wants to feel special.

01:02.920 --> 01:05.290
They wanna feel like they have something that they can do,...

01:05.560 --> 01:08.630
...a special skill, something that they can do better than anybody else in the world.

01:08.960 --> 01:11.840
And that is what Guinness World Records celebrates,....

01:12.070 --> 01:13.270
...everybody's uniqueness.

01:14.170 --> 01:16.600
I can't think of a better gift than to be in the book myself.
