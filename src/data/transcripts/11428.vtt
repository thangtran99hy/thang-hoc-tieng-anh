One day, a tortoise who was not happy with her life said,...

00:07.000 --> 00:09.170
..."I wish I could fly like the birds."

00:10.110 --> 00:13.040
Hearing the tortoise, an eagle flew down and said,...

00:13.710 --> 00:16.280
..."What will you give me if I teach you to fly?"

00:17.350 --> 00:20.820
"I'll give you everything I have," answered the tortoise,...

00:21.380 --> 00:23.820
...knowing very well that she had nothing to give.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.060
"Very well," the eagle said.

00:27.590 --> 00:30.560
And he picked the tortoise up, and flew into the sky with her.

00:31.560 --> 00:34.370
Then the tortoise told the eagle she had nothing to give him.

00:35.430 --> 00:40.740
The eagle said, "Then I will take your life instead," and he let go of the tortoise.

00:41.310 --> 00:44.640
The tortoise fell to the ground below and broke into pieces.

00:45.510 --> 00:50.410
As she was dying the tortoise said, "I have been so foolish to complain."

00:51.080 --> 00:54.480
"I should have been happy with being alive and crawling on the ground."
