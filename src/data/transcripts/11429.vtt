One morning, an old water rat put his head out of his hole.

00:07.500 --> 00:12.550
He could see a mother duck trying to teach her little ones how to stand on their heads in the water.

00:13.250 --> 00:15.750
"Friendship is much more important than love."

00:16.000 --> 00:19.550
"Nothing in the world is more important than a devoted friend."

00:20.000 --> 00:23.300
"Let me tell you a story on the subject," said the bird.

00:23.900 --> 00:26.100
"Once upon a time," said the bird,...

00:26.550 --> 00:29.900
..."there was an honest and happy little man named Hans."

00:30.800 --> 00:35.500
"Hans had many friends, but the most devoted friend of all was the miller."

00:36.250 --> 00:38.600
The miller was so devoted to Hans...

00:38.850 --> 00:43.350
...that he never went past his garden without picking some flowers and fruit from the trees.

00:43.900 --> 00:47.700
Sometimes, however, Hans's other friends thought it strange...

00:47.900 --> 00:51.550
...that the rich miller never gave little Hans anything in return.

00:52.300 --> 00:58.300
During the spring, the summer, and the autumn, Hans worked in his garden and was very happy,...

00:58.700 --> 01:04.600
...but when the winter came and he had no fruit or flowers to sell, he was often cold and hungry.

01:05.100 --> 01:09.150
He was very lonely because the miller never came to see him then.

01:09.600 --> 01:14.200
"There is no good reason for me to go and see Hans while there is snow on the ground,"...

01:14.600 --> 01:16.350
...the miller used to say to his wife.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.200
"But why can't we ask Hans to come here?" Asked the miller's youngest son.

01:21.550 --> 01:24.450
"If he is unhappy, I will give him half of my food."

01:25.200 --> 01:28.200
"What a silly boy you are!" Cried the miller.

01:28.950 --> 01:35.100
"Also, if he came here, he might ask me to let him have some flour and that I could not do."

01:35.500 --> 01:38.200
"Flour is one thing and friendship is another."

01:38.550 --> 01:44.000
"As soon as the winter was over and there were flowers in Hans's garden again," the bird continued,...

01:44.500 --> 01:46.600
..."the miller planned to visit little Hans."
