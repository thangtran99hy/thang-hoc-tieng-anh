He went from one of the top 100 movie stars of all time...

00:06.800 --> 00:09.000
...to a controversial Hollywood personality.

00:09.200 --> 00:15.500
Welcome to WatchMojo.com and today we'll be taking a look at the legendary career of superstar actor Tom Cruise.

00:15.800 --> 00:19.950
I feel the need, the need for speed!

00:21.550 --> 00:25.400
Born on July 3rd, 1962 in Syracuse, New York,...

00:25.450 --> 00:28.800
...he spent his childhood moving between dozens of homes and schools...

00:28.950 --> 00:32.500
...until settling in Glen Ridge, New Jersey at the age of 14.

00:32.667 --> 00:35.451
There, he developed a deep passion for acting...

00:35.547 --> 00:38.346
...that surpassed his longtime desire to join the priesthood.

00:38.433 --> 00:40.709
As a result, he dropped out of high school...

00:40.827 --> 00:43.687
...and headed back to New York to pursue a career as an actor.

00:43.800 --> 00:49.200
He quickly made his film debut with a small part in the 1981 drama/romance "Endless Love."

00:49.400 --> 00:52.950
Later that year, he got a larger role alongside Sean Penn...

00:53.050 --> 00:55.950
...as a gung ho cadet in the military film "Taps"...

00:56.000 --> 01:00.200
...and appeared in Francis Ford Coppola's film adaptation of "The Outsiders."

01:00.350 --> 01:01.650
Well, we're taking Evie and Sandy,...

01:01.900 --> 01:03.150
...which means no kids allowed.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.350
Big deal.

01:04.600 --> 01:08.850
In 1983, Cruise suddenly found himself overwhelmed with acting work.

01:08.900 --> 01:12.100
That year, he got his first starring role in the comedy "Losin' It"...

01:12.250 --> 01:16.400
...before achieving instant stardom for dancing in his briefs in "Risky Business."

01:21.450 --> 01:23.950
He then became a huge box office draw...

01:24.000 --> 01:28.650
...and was paid half a million dollars to star in Ridley Scott's fantasy film "Legend,"...

01:28.800 --> 01:33.400
...and four times that for the role of fighter pilot Lieutenant Pete "Maverick" Mitchell...

01:33.550 --> 01:36.000
...in 1986's blockbuster "Top Gun."
