00:01.100 --> 00:03.600
You might never fail on the scale I did,...

00:04.300 --> 00:07.000
...but some failure in life is inevitable.

00:07.800 --> 00:11.600
It is impossible to live without failing at something...

00:12.100 --> 00:16.350
...unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all.

00:16.950 --> 00:19.600
In which case, you fail by default.

00:21.550 --> 00:25.750
Failure gave me an inner security that I had never attained by passing examinations.

00:26.550 --> 00:30.200
Failure taught me things about myself that I could have learned no other way.

00:30.950 --> 00:32.800
I discovered that I had a strong will...

00:33.500 --> 00:35.600
...and more discipline than I had suspected.

00:36.400 --> 00:42.000
I also found out that I had friends whose value was truly above the price of rubies.

00:43.450 --> 00:46.800
The knowledge that you have emerged wiser and stronger from setbacks...

00:47.000 --> 00:51.500
...means that you are, ever after, secure in your ability to survive.

00:52.500 --> 00:56.700
You will never truly know yourself or the strength of your relationships...

00:56.950 --> 00:59.250
...until both have been tested by adversity.

01:00.200 --> 01:05.050
Such knowledge is a true gift for all that it is painfully won...

01:05.950 --> 01:09.550
...and it has been worth more than any qualification I ever earned.

01:10.850 --> 01:12.200
So, given a Time Turner,...

01:12.850 --> 01:15.850
...I would tell my 21-year-old self that personal happiness...

01:15.950 --> 01:20.850
...lies in knowing that life is not a checklist of acquisition or achievement.

01:21.500 --> 01:25.350
Your qualifications, your CV are not your life,...

01:25.700 --> 01:29.550
...though you will meet many people of my age and older who confuse the two.

01:30.500 --> 01:35.400
Life is difficult, and complicated, and beyond anyone's total control,...

01:36.150 --> 01:40.800
...and the humility to know that will enable you to survive its vicissitudes.
