00:02.200 --> 00:06.700
Roberta, Peter, and Phyllis were not railway children at first.

00:06.870 --> 00:10.970
They lived with their mother and father in a large house in the city.

00:11.910 --> 00:16.110
Then, about a week after their father went away, their mother said,...

00:16.680 --> 00:20.000
..."I'm sorry, children, but we must leave this house."

00:20.320 --> 00:23.320
"We are going to live in a smaller house in the country."

00:23.850 --> 00:26.550
The next morning, the children woke up early.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.890
"Let's get up and explore,"...

00:29.260 --> 00:30.330
...Roberta said.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.930
Suddenly, they heard a loud noise.

00:33.330 --> 00:38.630
Seconds later, a train rushed past. Smoke poured out of its funnel.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.870
"Let's walk along the side of the railway line to the station,"...

00:43.240 --> 00:44.010
...Peter said.

00:44.370 --> 00:48.980
When they reached the station, they saw that there were many different railway lines.

00:49.150 --> 00:53.320
A porter came out of his room and Peter asked him politely,...

00:54.180 --> 00:57.090
..."What are the white lines for on the piles of coal?"

00:57.820 --> 01:00.420
"They are so we know how much coal should be there,"...

01:00.760 --> 01:01.790
...the porter said.

01:02.090 --> 01:03.330
"So, don't you steal any!"

01:03.430 --> 01:07.800
The children did not stay at the station very long on this first visit.

01:08.300 --> 01:10.270
One evening, Roberta said,...

01:11.030 --> 01:12.930
..."Can we light a fire, Mother?"

01:13.210 --> 01:14.160
"No, dear,"...

01:14.450 --> 01:15.400
...Mother replied.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.010
"It's summer and coal is expensive."

01:18.540 --> 01:23.080
"We can't afford to have fires in summer, even though the evenings are cold."

01:24.110 --> 01:28.320
Two days later in the evening when it was dark, Peter said,...

01:29.120 --> 01:30.490
..."I want you to follow me."

01:30.840 --> 01:34.520
The children filled the pram with coal and pushed it home.

01:34.850 --> 01:37.930
They did this twice and were doing it the third time...

01:38.260 --> 01:41.430
...when the station master jumped out from behind a truck.

01:42.460 --> 01:43.300
"Caught you!"...

01:43.830 --> 01:44.670
...he shouted.

01:45.170 --> 01:47.000
"You young thief!"
