So, I grew up in New York City between Harlem and the Bronx.

00:21.050 --> 00:24.980
Growing up as a boy, we were always taught that men had to be tough, had to be strong,...

00:25.150 --> 00:32.060
...had to be courageous, dominating, no pain, no emotions, with the exception of anger,...

00:32.160 --> 00:33.460
...and definitely no fear.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.800
That men are in charge, which means women are not.

00:37.630 --> 00:41.840
That men lead and you should just follow and do what we say.

00:42.510 --> 00:45.140
That men are superior, women are inferior.

00:45.510 --> 00:47.780
That men are strong, women are weak.

00:49.080 --> 00:58.220
That women are of less value, property of men and objects, particularly sexual objects.

00:59.090 --> 01:03.730
I've later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men,...

01:04.860 --> 01:07.600
...better known as the "man box".

01:08.360 --> 01:10.350
See, this "man box" has in it...

01:10.630 --> 01:14.150
...all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man.

01:14.540 --> 01:18.040
And I also want to say, without a doubt, there are some wonderful, wonderful,...

01:18.140 --> 01:21.680
...absolutely wonderful things about being a man.

01:22.340 --> 01:27.780
But at the same time, there are some stuff that's just straight up twisted.

01:28.650 --> 01:32.690
And we really need to begin to challenge, look at it,...

01:33.220 --> 01:35.860
...and really get in the process of deconstructing,...

01:36.120 --> 01:40.160
...redefining what we've come to know as manhood.

01:41.130 --> 01:43.360
This is the love of my life, my daughter Jay.

01:43.870 --> 01:47.780
The world I envision for her, how do I want men to be acting and behaving,...

01:47.880 --> 01:50.180
...I need you on board. I need you with me.

01:50.540 --> 01:52.870
I need you working with me and me working with you...

01:53.110 --> 01:56.280
...on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.850
That it's okay to not be dominating.

01:59.050 --> 02:01.480
That it's okay to have feelings and emotions.

02:01.720 --> 02:03.650
That it's okay to promote equality.

02:03.750 --> 02:06.720
That it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it.

02:07.020 --> 02:08.890
That it's okay to be whole.

02:09.429 --> 02:14.760
That my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.700
I remember asking a nine-year-old boy.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.370
I asked a nine-year-old boy,...

02:21.400 --> 02:24.670
..."What would life be like for you if you didn't have to adhere to this man box?"

02:24.840 --> 02:26.940
He said to me, "I would be free."

02:27.240 --> 02:27.880
Thank you, folks!
