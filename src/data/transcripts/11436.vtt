00:00.350 --> 00:01.600
That's what hope is.

00:02.800 --> 00:03.900
That's what hope is,...

00:04.600 --> 00:10.100
...imagining and then fighting for and then working for what did not seem possible before.

00:12.150 --> 00:13.000
That's leadership.

00:14.100 --> 00:16.850
John F. Kennedy didn't look up at the moon and say, "That's too far."

00:18.550 --> 00:20.200
"We can't go, false hopes."

00:22.950 --> 00:27.950
Martin Luther King didn't stand on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and say,...

00:28.000 --> 00:31.100
..."Go home everybody, the dream's deferred, false hopes."

00:31.350 --> 00:32.700
"You all need a reality check."

00:37.800 --> 00:41.100
There is a moment in the life of every generation...

00:41.950 --> 00:47.700
...when that spirit of hopefulness has to come through if we are to make our mark on history.

00:49.350 --> 00:52.750
When we cast aside the fear and the doubt and the cynicism...

00:52.850 --> 00:56.850
...and we stop settling for what the cynics tell us we have to settle for.

00:59.400 --> 01:02.000
When we join together and we decide...

01:02.900 --> 01:07.250
...that we are gonna roll up our sleeves and we are gonna remake this country block by block,...

01:08.100 --> 01:09.300
...neighborhood by neighborhood,...

01:09.850 --> 01:10.800
...county by county,...

01:11.300 --> 01:12.300
...state by state.

01:12.950 --> 01:16.700
When we decide in our guts, when we are determined...

01:17.850 --> 01:21.700
...that our children and grandchildren deserve the same chance that somebody gave us.

01:22.750 --> 01:28.000
When we make a determination and we are willing to fight on the basis of the conviction...

01:29.100 --> 01:33.800
...that we are gonna keep the dream alive for those who still yearn for justice...

01:34.800 --> 01:37.900
...and still thirst for opportunity.
