00:02.330 --> 00:05.000
One day, Bassanio came to visit Antonio.

00:05.730 --> 00:11.270
He already owed Antonio a lot of money, but now he wanted to borrow some more.

00:12.010 --> 00:16.210
Of course, Antonio wanted to know why Bassanio needed the money.

00:17.010 --> 00:20.450
Bassanio told him about a rich young lady in Belmont.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.180
Her name was Portia.

00:22.600 --> 00:26.820
He told Antonio that if he had enough money, he would soon make her his wife.

00:27.530 --> 00:33.460
Antonio laughed. "You are my friend, Bassanio," he comforted, "and I will help you."

00:34.030 --> 00:36.630
"You know that all my ships are at sea just now,...

00:36.800 --> 00:38.930
...so I do not have much money to give you."

00:39.500 --> 00:42.500
"However, you can go into town and try to borrow the money."

00:43.300 --> 00:47.610
"Tell the moneylenders that Antonio will guarantee the money is paid back to them."

00:49.040 --> 00:55.220
When Antonio told Bassanio to go to town and borrow money, Bassanio visited Shylock.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.990
He asked Shylock to lend him 30 thousand dollars...

00:59.350 --> 01:01.860
...and said he would pay it back in three months.

01:02.760 --> 01:05.930
"How do I know you can pay it back?" asked Shylock.

01:06.730 --> 01:10.500
Bassanio smiled. "My friend Antonio will help me."

01:10.870 --> 01:13.840
"If I do not pay you in three months, he will do it for me."

01:14.300 --> 01:16.300
Shylock went to visit Antonio.

01:17.140 --> 01:20.910
"Come with me to the judge," said Shylock, "so he can write the contract."

01:21.510 --> 01:24.810
"I will lend you 30 thousand dollars for three months."

01:25.680 --> 01:27.080
"You will pay no interest."

01:27.820 --> 01:32.120
"Just for fun, however, let's agree that if you do not pay me on time,...

01:32.550 --> 01:37.030
...you will give me one pound of your flesh from wherever I choose to take it!"

01:38.260 --> 01:40.430
The news for Antonio was not good.

01:41.030 --> 01:44.700
The ship that sank in the sea between England and France was his.

01:45.170 --> 01:50.440
Its valuable cargo lay at the bottom of the sea and Antonio had lost his money.

01:51.070 --> 01:54.980
The news soon came to Venice and Shylock was happier than ever.

01:55.710 --> 02:00.320
"You will not take a pound of his flesh, will you?" Antonio's friends asked Shylock.

02:00.980 --> 02:03.750
"What use is that? What can you do with it?"

02:04.590 --> 02:06.890
"I can use it to go fishing," he replied.

02:07.590 --> 02:10.160
"I can't eat it, but it will make me feel good."

02:10.660 --> 02:12.790
"He lends money to people for no interest...

02:13.130 --> 02:15.800
...and so he takes away my friends and my business."

02:16.530 --> 02:19.330
"If you do me wrong, won't I take revenge?"
