00:16.650 --> 00:19.180
My real name is Dr. David Adamovich.

00:19.550 --> 00:21.580
My stage name is "The Great Throwdini".

00:21.920 --> 00:23.971
I've been throwing knives for 13 years.

00:24.004 --> 00:26.940
I started at the age of 50 and I'm 63 now.

00:27.460 --> 00:31.390
I'm in the Guinness World Records books for three records for the speed of my throwing.

00:32.260 --> 00:35.430
In one record, I threw 102 knives around a girl in one minute.

00:35.930 --> 00:40.600
In another record, I threw ten knives on one side in 4.29 seconds.

00:40.970 --> 00:46.040
And in the other record, I threw ten knives alternating on each side of the girl in four seconds.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.080
Good Lord!

00:51.650 --> 00:51.980
Thank you!

00:52.980 --> 00:55.950
What does it feel like to have knives thrown at me at such high speeds?

00:56.120 --> 00:57.890
It's alright as long as you don't move.

00:58.550 --> 00:59.820
I'm involved in sideshow.

01:00.610 --> 01:03.430
So, this is just another trick up my sleeve.

01:04.090 --> 01:05.830
I don't get scared, I don't flinch.

01:07.380 --> 01:10.630
I deal with a lot of blades and dangerous things.

01:15.870 --> 01:20.240
It's just wonderful to see myself in the Guinness World Records books for those three records...

01:20.710 --> 01:24.750
...and to be known around the world as the world's fastest knife thrower.
