00:03.500 --> 00:07.450
This team has been called the greatest NBA franchise of all time.

00:07.650 --> 00:13.200
Welcome to WatchMojo.com and today we'll be continuing our series of the most successful sports franchises...

00:13.300 --> 00:15.000
...with a look at the LA Lakers.

00:21.150 --> 00:27.500
Founded in 1946, the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers franchise originated in Detroit, Michigan.

00:27.750 --> 00:32.900
However, once Ben Berger and Morris Chalfen paid $15,000 for the Detroit Gems,...

00:33.100 --> 00:34.900
...they moved the team to Minneapolis.

00:35.150 --> 00:40.950
In fact, the team's official title comes from the Minnesota state nickname "Land of 10,000 Lakes."

00:41.100 --> 00:44.350
Nonetheless, the club managed to win five championships...

00:44.400 --> 00:50.550
...before owner Bob Short relocated the franchise to Los Angeles in the 1960-61 season,...

00:50.650 --> 00:53.250
...giving the NBA its first West Coast team.

00:53.600 --> 00:59.250
The Lakers acquired Wilt Chamberlain from the Philadelphia 76ers on July 9th, 1968.

00:59.550 --> 01:05.500
The club then went to set a record during the 1971-72 season by winning 69 games.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.900
The Lakers finally ended their championship drought that season...

01:09.050 --> 01:11.600
...by defeating the New York Knicks in five games,...

01:11.650 --> 01:14.550
...giving the team their first championship in Los Angeles.

01:14.750 --> 01:18.400
The team missed the playoffs during the 1974-75 season...

01:18.500 --> 01:21.750
...and subsequently acquired star player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.150
This move ushered in the "Showtime" era which lasted through the 1980s.

01:29.650 --> 01:34.800
This was even more evident once the team had drafted Earvin "Magic" Johnson from Michigan State.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.200
A move that helped the team defeat the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1980 championships.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.150
With the Lakers' "Showtime" era in full swing,...

01:43.300 --> 01:48.850
...the 1980s pitted the physical play of the Celtics against the more finesse-based game of the Lakers.

01:49.100 --> 01:54.200
The Lakers took the honors in 1982, '85, '87, and '88.

01:54.350 --> 01:57.000
The Lakers didn't win an award in the 1990s,...

01:57.100 --> 01:59.400
...but during the 1996 off-season,...

01:59.550 --> 02:04.800
...the club acquired 17-year-old Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for Vlade Divac.

02:05.050 --> 02:09.900
The Lakers also signed free agent Shaquille O'Neal during the off-season, and drafted Derek Fisher.

02:10.250 --> 02:13.900
In 1999, Phil Jackson joined the Lakers as head coach...

02:14.000 --> 02:15.900
...and the club moved into the Staples Center.

02:16.100 --> 02:18.200
Ushering in a new era of dominance,...

02:18.250 --> 02:23.950
...the new century saw the team three-peat in 2000, 2001, and 2002.

02:24.200 --> 02:28.650
The team underwent another rebuilding period from 2004-2007...

02:28.750 --> 02:31.300
...with Shaq leaving and Kobe remaining with the club.

02:31.600 --> 02:36.200
Assembling another cast of players around Kobe, the Lakers won again in 2009,...

02:36.400 --> 02:40.150
...earning the team's 15th title and their first in seven years.

02:40.350 --> 02:42.150
The club repeated in 2010,...

02:42.300 --> 02:46.200
...this time beating their archrival the Celtics for their 16th championship...

02:46.400 --> 02:50.750
...with Kobe managing to pick up the NBA Finals MVP in both years.
