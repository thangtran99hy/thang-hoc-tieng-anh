00:03.300 --> 00:08.550
When Matthew Cuthbert reached the station, there was no sign of any train.

00:09.300 --> 00:15.100
The only person he could see was a young girl, who seemed to be waiting for someone.

00:15.850 --> 00:19.200
"I'm not expecting a girl," said Matthew.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.300
"I'm expecting a boy."

00:21.900 --> 00:25.200
"There must be a mistake," the station master said.

00:25.800 --> 00:31.600
"Mrs. Spencer said that you and your sister were adopting that girl from a children's home."

00:33.000 --> 00:36.650
When Marilla saw Matthew at the door with the little girl,...

00:37.050 --> 00:40.900
...she said, "Matthew Cuthbert, who's that?"

00:41.300 --> 00:42.450
"Where is the boy?"

00:43.100 --> 00:46.000
"There wasn't any boy," said Matthew.

00:46.450 --> 00:48.100
"There was only her."

00:48.750 --> 00:52.950
"No boy? But there must have been a boy," said Marilla.

00:53.550 --> 00:56.100
"We told Mrs. Spencer to bring a boy."

00:56.900 --> 00:59.600
The little girl heard this and cried out,...

00:59.950 --> 01:01.100
..."You don't want me!"

01:01.650 --> 01:04.100
"You don't want me because I'm not a boy!"

01:04.750 --> 01:06.200
"Nobody wants me."

01:06.800 --> 01:08.950
"Oh, what shall I do?"...

01:09.450 --> 01:10.950
...And she began to cry.

01:11.700 --> 01:13.600
Marilla said to Matthew later,...

01:14.100 --> 01:17.500
..."This girl will have to be sent back to the children's home."

01:18.200 --> 01:21.950
"Yes, I suppose so," said Matthew sadly.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.850
"But she is a really nice little child, Marilla."

01:26.350 --> 01:29.550
"It's a pity to send her back when she wants to stay here."

01:30.150 --> 01:35.050
When Anne woke up the next morning, she could not remember where she was.

01:35.450 --> 01:37.250
Then, she remembered.

01:37.650 --> 01:43.050
This was Green Gables and they didn't want her because she wasn't a boy!

01:43.850 --> 01:46.050
It was such a beautiful place.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.850
She wished they would not send her away.
