00:02.160 --> 00:05.170
"This is the way to travel," Toad said.

00:05.730 --> 00:09.400
"Moving slowly through the countryside, enjoying the scenery."

00:09.770 --> 00:14.110
Suddenly, there was a roaring sound and a car raced toward the caravan.

00:14.880 --> 00:19.320
"Toot! Toot!" The driver sounded the car's horn. "Toot! Toot!"

00:19.780 --> 00:22.220
Toad fell off the seat and into a bush.

00:22.980 --> 00:27.290
Mole and Rat almost fell off the seat too, but they were able to hold on.

00:27.560 --> 00:32.290
"Oh, dear!" Rat said. "I do hope Toad isn't hurt."

00:32.530 --> 00:35.160
"Are you all right, Toad?" Rat asked.

00:35.930 --> 00:41.270
Toad opened his eyes. "Toot! Toot!" he said. "Toot! Toot!"

00:41.570 --> 00:45.170
"I think Toad has hurt his head," Rat said to Mole.

00:45.880 --> 00:49.380
"He's not well. He's making a noise like a car."

00:50.220 --> 00:51.480
Then he said to Toad,...

00:52.080 --> 00:56.150
"We'll go to the police station and complain about the driver of that car."

00:57.020 --> 01:02.730
Toad sat up. "Complain! Complain! We will not complain."

01:03.320 --> 01:10.270
"That wonderful, beautiful car is the way to travel. Fast. Toot! Toot!"

01:10.830 --> 01:15.370
"I'm finished with horses and caravans. I'm going to get a car like that."

01:16.500 --> 01:19.810
"I've heard bad news about Toad," Badger said.

01:20.380 --> 01:24.980
"He bought a car. He drives around the countryside like a madman."

01:25.750 --> 01:31.090
"He's already had several accidents. If he's not careful, he'll kill himself."

01:31.590 --> 01:32.750
"Or someone else."

01:33.620 --> 01:36.390
At that moment, Badger's front doorbell rang.

01:36.660 --> 01:40.360
"I had a small accident," Toad said.

01:41.200 --> 01:45.330
"I was sure I was somewhere near Badger's home, and here I am."

01:46.000 --> 01:48.870
"Tell me about this accident," Badger said.

01:49.670 --> 01:53.810
"Oh, I ran into some weasels. They were standing in the road."

01:54.110 --> 01:59.080
"A foolish place to stand," Toad said. "The car is quite useless now."

02:00.320 --> 02:04.120
"How many useless cars are there now?" Badger asked.

02:04.950 --> 02:13.660
"Oh, I don't know," Toad said. "I don't keep count. Six, perhaps. No, seven."

02:15.100 --> 02:18.800
"Why do you have all these accidents, Toad?" Badger demanded.

02:19.570 --> 02:22.240
"The cars are no good, of course," Toad said.

02:22.740 --> 02:25.910
"They don't stop in time. They go in the wrong direction."

02:27.310 --> 02:32.480
"I suppose it is not your driving that causes the accidents?" Badger said.

02:33.020 --> 02:38.150
"My driving! There's nothing wrong with my driving," Toad exclaimed.

02:38.920 --> 02:40.590
Badger looked at Mole and Rat.

02:41.660 --> 02:46.760
"My friends," he said. "Toad must stay here until we cure him."

02:47.560 --> 02:50.270
"Will you stay with me and make sure he doesn't get away?"
