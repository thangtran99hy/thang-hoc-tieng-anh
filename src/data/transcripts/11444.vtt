3 September 1875.

00:05.830 --> 00:09.600
It has been nine months since the patient's miraculous recovery and relapse,...

00:09.780 --> 00:11.750
...and I am no closer to a diagnosis.

00:12.540 --> 00:15.710
She is physically responsive, her reflexes acute,...

00:16.080 --> 00:19.420
...but her mind seems every day to slip further and further away.

00:19.950 --> 00:22.350
She's become less inclined to communicate...

00:22.680 --> 00:26.360
...and I believe she may be preparing for a more significant retreat.

00:26.890 --> 00:29.530
Tonics and other agents have proven ineffective.

00:30.330 --> 00:34.000
It is perhaps time to consider a more radical course of treatment.

00:44.310 --> 00:45.070
Alice?

00:45.740 --> 00:47.480
Is everything alright?
