00:01.000 --> 00:05.930
Many people around the world still ride bikes without protective helmets.

00:06.170 --> 00:10.970
In Sweden, only 20% of bike riders wear a helmet...

00:11.170 --> 00:15.700
...even though physicians say that bike falls are very dangerous...

00:15.800 --> 00:18.710
...and some of them end with fatal injuries.

00:20.820 --> 00:24.290
Such as when a bike is rear-ended by a car.

00:24.620 --> 00:29.720
This simulation shows how important it is to have a head protection.

00:30.160 --> 00:33.900
Anticipating the impact of a crash or a fall,...

00:34.200 --> 00:38.470
...a sensor in the protective collar triggers the air bag.

00:39.130 --> 00:46.150
The collar was designed by Terese Alstin and Anna Haupt from the Swedish town of Malmö.

00:46.910 --> 00:49.380
As students of industrial design,...

00:49.680 --> 00:54.580
...they started thinking how nice it would be to have an invisible bike helmet...

00:54.850 --> 00:56.570
...not messing up your hair.

00:57.090 --> 01:00.590
They turned it into a university graduation project...

01:00.890 --> 01:05.560
...and an independent Swedish organization for supporting inventions...

01:05.830 --> 01:11.270
...gave them a grant of 100,000 Swedish crowns to develop the idea.

01:11.800 --> 01:15.840
Their company, Hövding, now employs 13 people...

01:15.970 --> 01:19.970
...and hopes to market their product sometime next spring.
