00:03.650 --> 00:07.200
Two friends were traveling together when they met a bear on their path.

00:08.100 --> 00:10.350
One of them quickly climbed up into a tree.

00:11.350 --> 00:13.000
He did not help his friend climb up...

00:13.700 --> 00:16.900
...so the other man lay on the ground and pretended to be dead.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.350
The bear came up to him and smelled him all over.

00:21.250 --> 00:23.350
Then the bear said something in the traveler's ear.

00:24.300 --> 00:28.000
The bear didn't think the traveler would taste good, so he went away.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.450
When the bear had gone, the other traveler came down from the tree.

00:33.750 --> 00:36.900
"I saw the bear say something in your ear," he said.

00:37.600 --> 00:38.550
"What did it say?"

00:39.850 --> 00:41.550
"It told me," the man said,...

00:42.200 --> 00:45.350
..."never to travel with someone who runs away when there is danger."
