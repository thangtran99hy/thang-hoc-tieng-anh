00:03.200 --> 00:05.600
Once upon a time, there lived a camel.

00:06.050 --> 00:07.650
The camel was very lazy.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.950
He lived in the desert and never did any work.

00:11.450 --> 00:15.500
He just ate, and drank, and slept, and ate, and drank, and slept.

00:16.500 --> 00:21.000
One day, a horse came up to him and said, "I have a lot of work to do."

00:21.350 --> 00:22.200
"Come and help me."

00:22.850 --> 00:27.850
"Humph!" Grumbled the camel, and continued eating, and drinking, and sleeping.

00:28.450 --> 00:33.400
A little later, a dog came up to him and said, "I have a lot of work to do."

00:33.800 --> 00:34.600
"Come and help me."

00:35.400 --> 00:40.300
"Humph!" Grumbled the camel, and continued eating, and drinking, and sleeping.

00:41.200 --> 00:46.550
Not long after this, an ox came up to him and said, "I have a lot of work to do."

00:46.750 --> 00:47.550
"Come and help me."

00:48.100 --> 00:52.500
"Humph!" Grumbled the camel, and continued eating, and drinking, and sleeping.

00:53.100 --> 00:57.100
The horse, the dog, and the ox were very angry with the camel.

00:57.750 --> 00:58.500
They had a meeting.

00:59.300 --> 01:03.100
"He is the laziest animal we have ever seen," they complained.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.950
"He never does any work."

01:05.750 --> 01:09.600
"We have to work, but all he does is eat, and drink, and sleep."

01:10.050 --> 01:10.950
"It's not fair."

01:11.950 --> 01:13.750
"We have to do his work for him."

01:14.400 --> 01:16.550
A magician was standing near the animals,...

01:16.800 --> 01:17.850
...he heard them talking.

01:18.550 --> 01:22.950
"I believe you are angry with the camel because he doesn't do any work," he commented.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.700
The animals agreed that this was why they were angry with him.

01:27.650 --> 01:30.250
"I can do some magic," the magician suggested,...

01:30.750 --> 01:32.500
..."and stop him from being so lazy."

01:33.250 --> 01:38.300
The magician performed his magic and suddenly, the camel had a big hump on its back.

01:38.950 --> 01:41.050
The hump was filled with food and water.

01:41.900 --> 01:45.800
"You can live on what is in your hump for three days," he told the camel.

01:46.350 --> 01:49.300
"This means you can work for three days without eating and drinking."

01:49.850 --> 01:53.250
"Now, go and do your share of the work, and behave yourself."

01:54.200 --> 01:58.700
"Humph!" Grumbled the camel, but he did as the magician ordered.

01:59.450 --> 02:01.900
And this is why the camel has a hump.

02:02.550 --> 02:07.050
We call it a hump and not a "humph" because we don't want to hurt his feelings.
