00:13.318 --> 00:17.110
So, for any of us in this room today, let's start out by admitting, "We're lucky."

00:17.791 --> 00:21.289
We don't live in the world our mothers lived in, our grandmothers lived in,...

00:21.622 --> 00:23.984
...where career choices for women were so limited.

00:24.716 --> 00:26.194
And if you're in this room today,...

00:26.499 --> 00:30.785
...most of us grew up in a world where we had basic civil rights.

00:31.177 --> 00:34.711
And amazingly, we still live in a world where some women don't have them.

00:35.767 --> 00:39.351
But all that aside, we still have a problem, and it's a real problem.

00:39.827 --> 00:41.025
And the problem is this:...

00:41.479 --> 00:46.791
...Women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world.

00:47.451 --> 00:50.961
We also have another problem, which is that women face harder choices...

00:51.311 --> 00:54.206
...between professional success and personal fulfillment.

00:54.849 --> 00:58.246
So, the question is, "How are we gonna fix this?"

00:59.929 --> 01:02.779
"How do we change these numbers at the top?"

01:03.157 --> 01:05.083
"How do we make this different?"

01:06.018 --> 01:10.785
I wanna start out by saying, I talk about this, about keeping women in the workforce...

01:11.373 --> 01:13.438
...because I really think that's the answer.

01:14.020 --> 01:17.321
In the high-income part of our workforce, in the people who end up...

01:17.620 --> 01:22.689
...at the top Fortune 500 CEO jobs or the equivalent in other industries,...

01:23.388 --> 01:26.637
...the problem, I am convinced, is that women are dropping out.

01:27.401 --> 01:29.743
Everyone who's been through this and I'm here to tell you,...

01:29.995 --> 01:34.396
...once you have a child at home, your job better be really good to go back,...

01:34.515 --> 01:38.331
...because it's hard to leave that kid at home, your job needs to be challenging.

01:38.631 --> 01:40.077
It needs to be rewarding.

01:40.173 --> 01:42.025
You need to feel like you're making a difference.

01:42.825 --> 01:47.564
And if two years ago, you didn't take a promotion and some guy next to you did,...

01:48.255 --> 01:53.010
...if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities, you're gonna be bored...

01:53.626 --> 01:55.816
...because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal.

01:57.041 --> 01:59.217
Don't leave before you leave.

01:59.554 --> 02:00.499
Stay in. 

02:00.663 --> 02:03.927
Keep your foot on the gas pedal until the very day...

02:04.277 --> 02:09.202
...you need to leave to take a break for a child and then make your decisions.

02:09.771 --> 02:11.933
Don't make decisions too far in advance,...

02:12.257 --> 02:14.706
...particularly ones you're not even conscious you're making.

02:16.462 --> 02:20.054
My generation really, sadly, is not gonna change the numbers at the top.

02:20.513 --> 02:21.923
They're just not moving.

02:22.071 --> 02:25.038
We are not gonna get to where 50% of the population.

02:25.473 --> 02:29.530
In my generation, there will not be 50% of people at the top of any industry,...

02:30.732 --> 02:33.087
...but I'm hopeful that future generations can.

02:34.225 --> 02:37.127
I think the world that was run where half of our countries...

02:37.547 --> 02:41.142
...and half of our companies were run by women, would be a better world.

02:41.292 --> 02:44.498
And it's not just because people would know where the women's bathroom are,...

02:44.570 --> 02:48.967
...even though that would be very helpful. I think it would be a better world.

02:50.130 --> 02:51.115
I have two children.

02:51.523 --> 02:53.655
I have a five-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter.

02:54.455 --> 02:58.545
I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home,...

02:59.251 --> 03:02.906
...and I want my daughter to have the choice to not just exceed,...

03:03.199 --> 03:05.407
...but to be liked for her accomplishments.

03:05.851 --> 03:06.320
Thank you!
