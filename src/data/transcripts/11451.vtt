Many years ago in Japan, a farmer and his wife had three children, two boys and a girl.

00:09.600 --> 00:14.240
The girl was small and not very strong. She was often sick.

00:14.540 --> 00:16.650
She spent her time drawing cats.

00:17.380 --> 00:19.380
Her mother told her father one day,...

00:19.820 --> 00:23.750
"She is no use to us. Let's take her to the temple."

00:24.050 --> 00:27.120
"She can become a nun and live at the temple."

00:27.760 --> 00:29.730
The girl went to live at the temple.

00:30.090 --> 00:33.260
She drew cats at all times of the day and night.

00:33.460 --> 00:34.960
One of the other nuns said,...

00:35.660 --> 00:39.300
"You are not the kind of young woman we want here."

00:39.700 --> 00:42.340
"I must ask you to leave the temple."

00:43.040 --> 00:46.550
The girl left the temple. She did not have any money,...

00:46.650 --> 00:49.110
...and she did not want to go back to the farm.

00:49.710 --> 00:53.480
"I will sell some of my drawings of cats," she thought.

00:53.980 --> 00:56.590
It was night by the time she came to a town.

00:56.950 --> 00:59.700
Just outside the town, there was a large temple.

01:00.020 --> 01:04.830
It was very quiet. "I will stay here tonight," she thought.

01:05.190 --> 01:09.400
The temple was quiet because only a dangerous goblin lived in the temple.

01:09.660 --> 01:12.200
She knocked on the door, but no one came.

01:12.740 --> 01:16.600
The girl wanted to sleep, but she also wanted to draw some cats.

01:17.140 --> 01:20.840
When the screen was full of cats, she lay down and went to sleep.

01:21.310 --> 01:24.080
The girl slept until about the middle of the night.

01:24.250 --> 01:28.820
Then she heard a terrible noise. The noises did not stop until morning.

01:29.050 --> 01:33.660
There was a very large dead rat in the middle of the room.

01:34.090 --> 01:36.520
The girl knew that it was a goblin rat.

01:36.890 --> 01:41.130
"Something very big and strong killed that rat," she thought.

01:41.400 --> 01:46.100
She saw the large paper screen. It was covered with her drawings of cats.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.540
Their mouths were red with blood.

01:49.140 --> 01:52.740
"My cat drawings came to life in the night," she thought.

01:53.040 --> 01:55.280
"They saved me from the goblin rat."

01:55.910 --> 01:57.980
She left the temple and went on her way.

01:58.350 --> 02:02.250
Everywhere she went, people wanted to buy her cat drawings from her.

02:02.580 --> 02:06.610
Soon, she became one of the most famous artists in Japan.
