Britain is a pretty good place to be if you're a disabled person in terms of sport.

00:17.150 --> 00:20.150
We're the envy of the world in terms of our support structures,...

00:20.450 --> 00:24.600
...our media coverage, the games that we're gonna be hosting.

00:24.950 --> 00:29.050
We're using it as a platform to show the world what we can achieve.

00:29.450 --> 00:33.050
And actually, you know, in the outside world away from sport,...

00:33.500 --> 00:35.900
...it's still one of the best countries to be in.

00:39.500 --> 00:42.700
Racing is amazing because it's speed, it's fear.

00:42.950 --> 00:47.350
If you're on a road race, you can be going downhill at 50 miles an hour, 2 feet from the ground,...

00:47.700 --> 00:48.950
...and your brakes don't really work.

00:49.950 --> 00:54.450
It's exhaustion, it's elation, it's so many different things all wrapped up together.

00:54.950 --> 00:58.400
And if you're competing on the track that can happen in 20 seconds,...

00:58.500 --> 01:00.200
...it's the most amazing feeling.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.200
But the outside world is so different from that.
