00:00.700 --> 00:04.580
To say that Koreans love kimchi is to make a startling understatement.

00:04.970 --> 00:09.200
The spicy vegetable dish usually made of fermented cabbage, red peppers, and garlic...

00:09.510 --> 00:12.170
...takes up entire sections of grocery stores.

00:12.340 --> 00:16.420
Traveling businessmen carry it abroad in their suitcases for fear of doing without.

00:16.550 --> 00:19.780
And any student of history knows that clay pots full of this stuff...

00:19.880 --> 00:23.910
...kept the Korean people alive for centuries during harsh winter seasons.

00:24.220 --> 00:29.430
So, when South Koreans prepared to send astronaut Yi So-yeon to the International Space Station...

00:29.530 --> 00:35.060
...for at least ten days, some asked whether any Korean could manage without Kimchi for that long.

00:35.560 --> 00:40.240
Kim Sung-soo is a senior engineer at the Korea Food Research Institute near Seoul.

00:40.640 --> 00:43.200
For him, the answer to that question is clear.

00:46.910 --> 00:49.950
Yi So-yeon will not survive in space without kimchi.

00:50.250 --> 00:53.450
Koreans need to eat kimchi every day in order to sustain their health.

00:53.750 --> 00:56.220
She'll have all kinds of problems in space without it.

00:59.320 --> 01:03.430
But Kim points out taking kimchi into orbit is no simple matter.

01:04.030 --> 01:08.130
The dish gets much of its flavor and nutritional value from fermentation.

01:08.500 --> 01:13.300
That age-old bacterial process that makes bread rise and gives beer its bubbles...

01:13.400 --> 01:18.170
...can create a series of dangers in a tightly controlled environment of a space voyage.

01:18.470 --> 01:23.810
Kim has spent most of the last two years in a laboratory making kimchi ready for space.

01:23.910 --> 01:29.590
His team starts by irradiating and slightly cooking regular kimchi to reduce bacteria.

01:29.920 --> 01:36.260
Then the dish is frozen and rapidly dehydrated in giant appliances in an industrial facility next door.

01:36.790 --> 01:40.160
Finally, it is cut into little cubes that look like biscuits ---

01:41.500 --> 01:44.100
then, vacuum sealed into plastic bags.

01:45.330 --> 01:50.340
Astronauts can cut right into the bags and add water, rehydrating the cabbage and spices.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.880
Then, it is ready to eat right out of the plastic.

01:58.780 --> 01:59.320
Very good.
