00:06.400 --> 00:07.500
We can't do this anymore.

00:08.700 --> 00:10.450
They've arranged for you to marry Henry Lazar.

00:12.100 --> 00:13.100
What do we do now?

00:14.200 --> 00:15.550
I'd do anything to be with you.

00:18.950 --> 00:20.100
It killed again.

00:20.850 --> 00:21.250
The wolf.

00:22.800 --> 00:26.100
In daytime, the werewolf returns to its human form.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.150
The wolf is someone in this village.

00:39.550 --> 00:41.000
Tell me who it is.

00:46.550 --> 00:47.300
I'm wrong for you.

00:49.000 --> 00:49.700
I don't care.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.800
You will be happy again.

00:56.100 --> 00:56.950
Come away with me.

01:00.050 --> 01:01.150
You better watch yourself.

01:09.500 --> 01:10.450
The wolf is coming.

01:11.800 --> 01:12.950
You're gonna get what you deserve.
