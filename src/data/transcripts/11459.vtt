My name is Andrew Dahl.

00:12.240 --> 00:13.810
I'm from the United States.

00:14.140 --> 00:18.820
And my Guinness World Record is the most balloons blown up by nose in three minutes.

00:24.960 --> 00:28.390
I discovered that I could blow a balloon with my nose when I was seven years old.

00:28.590 --> 00:30.090
I was sitting in the back of my car...

00:30.460 --> 00:33.250
...one day and I was really bored and I decided that I'd try something new.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.870
I decided that I'd go for the world record because I...

00:38.070 --> 00:41.240
...showed a bunch of my friends there and they, no one else that I knew, could do it.

00:41.340 --> 00:42.740
So, I decided that...

00:43.910 --> 00:48.280
...if this is so unique then, maybe I can set a world record with it.

00:50.710 --> 00:56.350
My goal is to try to break the record once a year until I can't beat it anymore.
