00:07.650 --> 00:10.650
Hello? Someone called about a rental here?

00:11.450 --> 00:12.100
You're looking at it.

00:12.550 --> 00:13.550
Wait, what's the catch?

00:14.150 --> 00:15.100
In every city,...

00:17.150 --> 00:17.950
The place is huge.

00:18.250 --> 00:19.350
Anything available for me?

00:19.750 --> 00:22.500
...thousands of women live by themselves.

00:23.300 --> 00:23.750
Excuse me.

00:24.150 --> 00:24.650
Max!

00:24.850 --> 00:25.400
Hey!

00:27.900 --> 00:30.100
I'm just putting myself in your shoes:...

00:30.200 --> 00:31.950
...alone in your apartment,...

00:32.100 --> 00:33.650
...surrounded by strangers.

00:34.550 --> 00:39.100
Juliet is not alone.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.000
There's something creepy about my apartment.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.950
The guy gives you a gorgeous apartment and that's creepy?

00:55.500 --> 00:57.850
The record feature is triggered by movement,...

00:58.100 --> 01:00.550
...so any activity in the apartment will be recorded.

01:01.250 --> 01:03.700
These babies will get anything that moves.

01:04.600 --> 01:05.500
I followed you one night.

01:06.050 --> 01:06.800
You followed me home?

01:23.350 --> 01:24.100
Help!

01:42.950 --> 01:43.750
The Resident.
