In the US, 77% of workers who have a Facebook account...

00:14.233 --> 00:16.345
...say they check their updates at work.

00:16.704 --> 00:17.809
In the United Kingdom,...

00:17.981 --> 00:23.453
...a similar survey of workers shows 57% regularly log on to social networks,...

00:23.675 --> 00:27.266
...resulting in 40 minutes of lost worker productivity per day.

00:27.579 --> 00:32.649
Philip Wicks is a consultant at London-based technology research firm, Morse PLC.

00:32.942 --> 00:35.681
It isn't just something that you can just do for half an hour during a lunch break...

00:35.950 --> 00:39.517
...but all through the day and because of that, it has a huge impact...

00:39.614 --> 00:43.569
...because people just aren't necessarily concentrating on what they should be during the day.

00:43.923 --> 00:46.617
Wicks estimates social networking during office hours...

00:46.713 --> 00:50.816
...costs businesses in the UK about two and a quarter billion dollars a year.

00:51.088 --> 00:56.955
Workplace consultants say the losses will grow as social and blogging sites attract even more users.

00:57.213 --> 01:01.999
Some workers say networking sites are helpful in exchanging ideas, boosting morale,...

01:02.277 --> 01:04.448
...or finding the right candidate for the job.

01:04.749 --> 01:07.307
Certainly, LinkedIn on the professional level...

01:07.614 --> 01:13.139
...is a very useful tool in connecting with other professionals.

01:13.497 --> 01:17.994
But others argue online socializing is best left outside the office.

01:18.175 --> 01:21.880
If you want to spend time on the weekends on it or in the evenings, it's fine.

01:22.165 --> 01:25.184
But, I think most people are probably too busy,...

01:25.499 --> 01:28.012
...should be too busy, to do it at work anyways.

01:28.135 --> 01:32.237
Studies show the amount of time people spend on social networking and blogging sites...

01:32.341 --> 01:33.913
...has tripled since last year.

01:34.296 --> 01:35.953
Employers are fighting back.

01:36.328 --> 01:39.315
A recent survey shows 54% of US companies...

01:39.519 --> 01:43.223
...have already banned social networking and blogging while on the job.
