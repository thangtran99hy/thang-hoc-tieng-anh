00:04.585 --> 00:05.171
Where's the buttons?

00:05.277 --> 00:07.690
They've installed voice recognition technology in this lift.

00:08.853 --> 00:10.367
Voice recognition technology?

00:10.887 --> 00:11.607
In a lift?

00:12.136 --> 00:12.915
 In Scotland?

00:13.702 --> 00:15.799
You ever tried voice recognition technology?

00:16.465 --> 00:16.914
No.

00:17.097 --> 00:19.001
They don't do Scottish accents.

00:20.667 --> 00:21.255
Eleven.

00:22.681 --> 00:24.461
Could you please repeat that?

00:26.216 --> 00:26.896
Eleven.

00:27.990 --> 00:29.657
Could you please repeat that?

00:30.938 --> 00:32.267
Eleven.

00:33.506 --> 00:34.533
Whose idea was this?

00:35.855 --> 00:37.280
You need to try an American accent.

00:38.634 --> 00:39.345
Eleven.

00:39.571 --> 00:41.110
That sounds Irish, not American.

00:41.734 --> 00:42.341
Eleven.

00:42.805 --> 00:44.142
Where in America is that, Dublin?

00:44.259 --> 00:45.422
Try an English accent, all right?

00:47.863 --> 00:50.592
Eleven.

00:51.553 --> 00:53.515
Are you from the same part of England as Dick Van Dyke?

00:53.731 --> 00:55.845
Please speak slowly and clearly.

00:55.981 --> 00:56.901
Eleven.

00:57.776 --> 01:00.675
I'm sorry, could you please repeat that?

01:02.227 --> 01:06.678
Eleven.

01:06.771 --> 01:07.846
You're just saying it the same way.

01:08.501 --> 01:11.177
I wanna keep saying it until it understands Scottish, all right?

01:11.389 --> 01:12.774
Just take us anywhere, you cow.

01:13.302 --> 01:14.518
 Just open the doors.

01:14.790 --> 01:16.993
This is a voice-activated elevator.

01:17.483 --> 01:21.777
Please state which floor you would like to go to in a clear and calm manner.

01:22.128 --> 01:23.855
You have not selected a floor.

01:24.088 --> 01:28.946
If you would like to get out of the elevator without selecting a floor, simply say,...

01:29.385 --> 01:30.999
..."Open the doors, please."

01:31.435 --> 01:32.808
Why didn't you just say please?

01:34.745 --> 01:36.106
I'm not begging that for nothing.

01:41.507 --> 01:43.023
Open the doors, please?

01:44.283 --> 01:45.039
Please?

01:45.374 --> 01:46.065
Pathetic.

01:46.691 --> 01:48.101
Please remain calm.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.889
Would you let me up to that, get me up there!

01:53.078 --> 01:54.480
Right, just wait for it to speak.

01:57.920 --> 01:59.341
You have not selected a floor.

01:59.438 --> 02:00.913
Up yours, you cow.

02:01.317 --> 02:03.963
If you don't open these doors, I'm going to come to America,...

02:04.115 --> 02:06.963
...I'm going to find whatever desperate actress gave you a voice...

02:07.142 --> 02:09.153
...and I'm gonna get an electric chair for you.

02:09.222 --> 02:13.403
Scotland!

02:13.596 --> 02:19.376
Freedom!

02:25.382 --> 02:25.887
Going up?
