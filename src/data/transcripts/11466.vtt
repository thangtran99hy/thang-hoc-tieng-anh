00:03.150 --> 00:04.900
We sat in comfortable chairs.

00:05.400 --> 00:08.200
They were designed by the time traveler, as we shall call him.

00:09.150 --> 00:11.600
"Listen carefully to what I say," he said.

00:12.150 --> 00:14.950
"I shall make statements with which you will not agree."

00:16.000 --> 00:17.650
"Why will we not agree?" I asked.

00:18.500 --> 00:21.850
"Because the science and mathematics you know are not correct," he said.

00:22.300 --> 00:26.400
"You believe there are only three dimensions: length, breadth, and thickness."

00:27.350 --> 00:31.150
"There is nothing to argue with that," the youngest member of our little group said.

00:31.750 --> 00:34.200
"Exactly!" The time traveler answered.

00:34.750 --> 00:38.150
"But there is also a fourth dimension: time."

00:39.150 --> 00:42.200
"We all know about time," another member of the group said.

00:42.800 --> 00:43.700
"Time passes."

00:44.550 --> 00:47.200
"I do not agree," the time traveler said.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.700
"Length, breadth, and thickness do not pass."

00:51.300 --> 00:53.400
"They stay in the same place in space."

00:54.000 --> 00:55.050
"We move about them."

00:55.900 --> 00:57.950
"I can prove that time is the same."

00:58.650 --> 00:59.700
"It does not pass."

01:00.600 --> 01:04.800
"We move in time the same way that we move in breadth, length, and thickness."

01:05.850 --> 01:07.100
The time traveler smiled.

01:07.750 --> 01:09.300
"It is clear," he said,...

01:09.700 --> 01:13.000
..."that there is only one way I can convince you that I am right."

01:13.700 --> 01:15.450
"We must conduct an experiment."

01:16.550 --> 01:19.500
He left the room and we heard him walking toward his laboratory.

01:20.300 --> 01:21.250
He soon returned.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.850
He was carrying what looked like a clock.

01:24.750 --> 01:27.650
"This is a model of a time machine," he said.

01:28.300 --> 01:30.050
"I plan to build such a machine."

01:31.050 --> 01:32.700
We followed him to his laboratory.

01:33.250 --> 01:35.150
There, we saw the actual machine;...

01:35.600 --> 01:38.550
...not quite complete but large enough for a man to sit in.
