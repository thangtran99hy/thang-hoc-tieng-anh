Eighteen years ago, when Wayde was about thirty years of age, he was a failure.

00:07.700 --> 00:11.900
This was surprising because he was a clever man, and most people liked him.

00:12.600 --> 00:16.450
Wayde's best friend was a doctor, an older man named Manningtree.

00:17.050 --> 00:22.150
One day, Manningtree said to Wayde, "I have known you for many years, Wayde...

00:22.500 --> 00:24.950
...and I am surprised you are such a failure."

00:25.900 --> 00:28.900
"Your problem, Wayde," Manningtree said,...

00:29.150 --> 00:31.950
..."is that you have no confidence in yourself."

00:32.450 --> 00:34.700
"And I'm sure that if you were more confident,...

00:35.000 --> 00:37.700
...you could be very successful in everything."

00:38.800 --> 00:42.000
"Oh, I don't think so," Wayde said.

00:42.400 --> 00:46.300
"Every time I try to do something, I am sure I shall fail."

00:47.450 --> 00:50.450
"The reason you think that," Manningtree said,...

00:50.800 --> 00:52.800
..."is that you suffer from nerves."

00:54.200 --> 00:56.100
"You're right," Wayde said.

00:56.350 --> 00:59.550
"I do worry and I am nervous about everything."

00:59.900 --> 01:01.950
"But what can I do about it?"

01:02.700 --> 01:07.400
"There is a medicine that cures nerves," Manningtree said.

01:08.150 --> 01:13.950
"Just take one small drop of the medicine once a month," Manningtree said.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.900
Wayde took the bottle from his friend.

01:17.250 --> 01:19.500
Once a month, he took one small drop.

01:20.100 --> 01:21.550
The effect was immediate.

01:21.950 --> 01:24.350
Suddenly, he was not nervous anymore.
