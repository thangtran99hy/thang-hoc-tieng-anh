00:03.700 --> 00:06.940
A pigeon, a deer, and a turtle were friends.

00:07.240 --> 00:10.320
They sat under the same tree every day.

00:10.640 --> 00:13.540
One day, the deer did not come to the tree.

00:13.940 --> 00:18.850
"Where is Deer?" Pigeon said. "He's usually here by now."

00:19.480 --> 00:23.220
"Fly around and see if you can find him."

00:23.550 --> 00:28.360
She soon found Deer. One of his legs was caught in a trap made of rope.

00:28.990 --> 00:32.560
"I'm so glad to see you Pigeon," Deer said.

00:32.930 --> 00:36.160
"I was walking through the forest and I did not see the trap."

00:36.500 --> 00:39.630
"I will get you out of the trap," Pigeon said.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.900
She kept on pecking for many minutes.

00:42.100 --> 00:48.680
Then she said, "I'm sorry, Deer, but my beak isn't strong enough. I'll go and get Turtle."

00:48.910 --> 00:50.970
"His teeth are stronger than my beak."

00:51.210 --> 00:53.980
As she did, she passed by the hunter's house.

00:54.280 --> 00:57.220
He was coming out of the house. He had a gun.

00:57.650 --> 01:02.590
Pigeon thought, "He'll get to Deer before Turtle can bite through the rope.

01:02.890 --> 01:05.360
Pigeon flew at the hunter and pecked at his head.

01:05.790 --> 01:08.360
At last, the hunter went back into his house.

01:08.700 --> 01:12.380
Pigeon went on her way back to Turtle. She told him about Deer.

01:12.900 --> 01:16.000
As soon as he found Deer, he began to bite the rope.

01:16.240 --> 01:19.070
His teeth were strong, but so was the rope.

01:19.810 --> 01:27.150
"Fly back to the hunter's cottage again," Turtle said. "I need more time."

01:27.720 --> 01:29.820
Pigeon flew back to the hunter's cottage.

01:29.980 --> 01:31.820
He was coming out with his gun again.

01:32.150 --> 01:35.790
She began pecking him, but this time he had a large bag over his head.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.660
Pigeon flew back to Turtle and Deer.

01:39.030 --> 01:43.630
"Quickly! Quickly!" Pigeon cried. "I cannot stop the hunter."

01:44.070 --> 01:46.300
The hunter came nearer and nearer.

01:46.450 --> 01:50.210
Then, just in time, Turtle bit through the rope.

01:50.670 --> 01:55.110
"I will shoot and eat that turtle," the hunter decided.

01:55.410 --> 01:58.080
Before he could shoot however, Deer arrived.

01:58.480 --> 02:01.650
When the hunter saw Deer, he forgot about Turtle.

02:01.920 --> 02:05.620
He pointed his gun at Deer, but Deer moved away.

02:05.850 --> 02:11.260
The hunter ran after him. He led the hunter a long way into the forest.

02:11.830 --> 02:17.170
Deer, Turtle, and Pigeon still meet to talk about their lives and tell stories.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.030
One of them often says,...

02:19.730 --> 02:25.270
"Let's talk about that time we worked together and saved Deer from the hunter."

02:25.810 --> 02:27.780
It's their favorite story.
