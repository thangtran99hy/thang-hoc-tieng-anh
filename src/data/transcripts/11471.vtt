If I did not know Brownlow well, I would not believe this story.

00:08.350 --> 00:09.450
But I know him well.

00:09.850 --> 00:14.050
Like all of us, he tells small lies sometimes but never big lies.

00:14.600 --> 00:17.300
And he has no reason to lie about his newspaper.

00:18.050 --> 00:22.050
He had the Evening Standard delivered to his apartment Monday to Saturday.

00:22.550 --> 00:25.800
He was surprised to see that the name on the wrapper was not his own.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.700
He sat back in his chair and began to read.

00:29.350 --> 00:34.450
Within a couple of minutes, he realized that he was reading a newspaper about events in another world.

00:35.150 --> 00:37.400
He looked at the date at the top of the newspaper.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.400
November 10th, 2051.

00:41.100 --> 00:44.400
But the date in our world was November 10th, 2001.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.300
It explained that there was now no need to dig into the earth for coal.

00:48.900 --> 00:50.450
It was cleaner and cheaper.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.600
It solved the carbon dioxide problem that was causing global warming.

00:55.200 --> 00:58.050
Apart from the importance of the front page news story,...

00:58.150 --> 01:00.450
...the paper was full of unusual things.

01:01.150 --> 01:04.000
There were many articles on scientific subjects,...

01:04.400 --> 01:07.250
...and the pictures of fashions were especially interesting.

01:07.750 --> 01:11.000
There were photographs of people in African and Indian cities,...

01:11.400 --> 01:13.500
...and they all looked well and prosperous.

01:14.150 --> 01:17.000
The only sad story was about the death of a gorilla.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.300
It was the last gorilla on Earth.

01:20.150 --> 01:22.800
The more he thought about the contents of the newspaper,...

01:23.100 --> 01:24.550
...the more he thought it was real.
