Lionel Wallace told me that the first time he saw the door in the wall,...

00:07.050 --> 00:08.550
...he was five years of age.

00:09.050 --> 00:10.600
"It was sometime in October."

00:10.950 --> 00:14.850
"I can't remember exactly where I was when I saw the door in the wall."

00:15.500 --> 00:17.150
"The door in the wall was green."

00:17.950 --> 00:20.850
"At first, I walked past it, then I turned back."

00:21.350 --> 00:22.350
"I don't know why."

00:22.950 --> 00:26.700
"I just felt I had to open that door and find out what was on the other side."

00:27.650 --> 00:28.900
"It was extraordinary."

00:29.600 --> 00:32.700
"What was also strange was that I felt I knew the place."

00:33.400 --> 00:34.500
"It was like coming home."

00:35.200 --> 00:36.550
"I wasn't at all afraid."

00:37.400 --> 00:38.800
"There were people walking around."

00:39.500 --> 00:41.100
"They all seemed friendly and happy."

00:42.000 --> 00:45.200
"I saw love for me and for one another in their eyes."

00:45.900 --> 00:48.300
"And then a woman in a dark robe came up to me."

00:49.000 --> 00:52.250
"She opened a large book and put it on her knee so that I could see it."

00:53.050 --> 00:56.650
"There was a picture of me in the poor street with its small, dirty shops."

00:57.400 --> 01:00.300
"And then I realized that I was not looking at a page in the book,...

01:00.900 --> 01:03.800
...I was back in that street, alone and unhappy."
