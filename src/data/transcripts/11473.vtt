Being here with tonight's honorees, reflecting on their contributions,...

00:05.470 --> 00:10.900
...I'm reminded of a Supreme Court opinion by the great Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.

00:11.570 --> 00:15.050
In a case argued before the Court in 1926,...

00:15.400 --> 00:17.160
...the majority ruled that the state of New York...

00:17.510 --> 00:21.380
...couldn't regulate the price of theater tickets because in the opinion of the majority,...

00:21.950 --> 00:24.420
...the theater was not a public necessity.

00:25.350 --> 00:30.360
They argued in effect that the experience of attending the theater was superfluous.

00:31.230 --> 00:32.990
And this is what Justice Holmes had to say.

00:33.930 --> 00:36.030
"Too many people," he wrote in his dissent...

00:38.600 --> 00:39.530
...let me start that over.

00:40.170 --> 00:44.190
"To many people, the superfluous..." it's this lip.

00:46.350 --> 00:47.180
It's hard to say.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.880
You try it when you've had 12 stitches.

00:55.880 --> 00:59.290
"The superfluous." Thank you.

01:00.990 --> 01:01.520
Alright.

01:02.390 --> 01:04.730
"To many people the superfluous is necessary."

01:06.360 --> 01:10.070
"The theater is necessary. Dance is necessary."

01:10.900 --> 01:16.040
"Song is necessary. The arts are necessary."

01:16.140 --> 01:18.070
"They are a necessary part of our lives."

01:19.070 --> 01:21.640
The men and women here tonight embody that idea.

01:22.480 --> 01:26.280
Their work has enriched our lives. It's inspired us to greatness.

01:26.780 --> 01:31.550
And tonight, it is my honor to offer them the appreciation of a grateful nation.

01:32.120 --> 01:36.160
Thank you very much, all five of you. God bless you. Thank you.
