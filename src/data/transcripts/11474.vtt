00:16.280 --> 00:19.600
I'm actually here to make a challenge to people.

00:19.750 --> 00:22.400
I know there've been many challenges made to people.

00:22.550 --> 00:26.660
The one I'm gonna make is that it is time for us to reclaim...

00:26.920 --> 00:29.630
...what peace really means.

00:29.990 --> 00:32.690
Peace is not "Kumbaya, my Lord."

00:32.990 --> 00:38.100
Peace is not the dove and the rainbow, as lovely as they are.

00:38.670 --> 00:44.640
When I see the symbols of the rainbow and the dove, I think of personal serenity.

00:45.210 --> 00:46.910
I think of meditation.

00:47.640 --> 00:52.580
I do not think about what I consider to be peace,...

00:53.020 --> 00:58.160
...which is sustainable peace with justice and equality.

00:58.650 --> 01:05.190
It is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet...

01:05.790 --> 01:11.470
...have access to enough resources to live dignified lives,...

01:12.270 --> 01:17.740
...where these people have enough access to education and health care,...

01:18.570 --> 01:23.350
...so that they can live in freedom from want, and freedom from fear.

01:24.350 --> 01:26.680
This is called "human security".

01:26.950 --> 01:28.150
The Women's League of Burma,...

01:28.420 --> 01:34.520
...11 individual organizations of Burmese women came together because there's strength in numbers.

01:34.760 --> 01:37.730
Working together is what changes our world.

01:38.060 --> 01:43.200
The Million Signatures Campaign of women inside Burma working together...

01:43.500 --> 01:46.650
...to change human rights, to bring democracy to that country.

01:46.750 --> 01:52.540
When one is arrested and taken to prison, another one comes out and joins the movement.

01:53.040 --> 01:59.050
Recognizing that if they work together, they will ultimately bring change in their own country.

01:59.850 --> 02:05.250
In my view, what we need today is people getting up and taking action...

02:05.550 --> 02:07.460
...to reclaim the meaning of peace.

02:07.660 --> 02:11.760
It's not a dirty word. It's hard work every single day.

02:11.860 --> 02:15.160
And if each of us who cares about the different things we care about...

02:15.900 --> 02:21.370
...got up off our butts and volunteered as much time as we could,...

02:22.600 --> 02:24.370
...we would change this world.

02:24.670 --> 02:27.680
We would save this world and we can't wait for the other guy,...

02:27.780 --> 02:29.780
...we have to do it ourselves. Thank you!
