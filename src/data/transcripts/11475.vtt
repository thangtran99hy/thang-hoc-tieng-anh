00:15.350 --> 00:16.750
I said I wanted to do three things with you today.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.400
I said I wanted to tell you the "Awesome" story,...

00:18.650 --> 00:20.350
...I want to share with you the three A's of "Awesome".

00:21.300 --> 00:24.950
They are attitude, awareness, and authenticity.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.550
I'd love to just talk about each one briefly.

00:29.900 --> 00:30.650
So attitude.

00:32.200 --> 00:35.300
Look, we're all gonna get lumps, and we're all gonna get bumps.

00:36.450 --> 00:37.650
None of us can predict the future...

00:37.700 --> 00:41.400
...but we do know one thing about it and that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan.

00:42.250 --> 00:46.100
And when that bad news washes over you, and when that pain sponges and soaks in,...

00:46.450 --> 00:50.000
...I just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices.

00:50.600 --> 00:54.600
One, you can swirl and twirl and gloom and doom forever,...

00:55.200 --> 01:00.050
...or two, you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes.

01:01.250 --> 01:03.800
Having a great attitude is about choosing option number two,...

01:03.850 --> 01:07.050
...and choosing, no matter how difficult it is, no matter what pain hits you,...

01:07.600 --> 01:11.300
...choosing to move forward and move on and take baby steps into the future.

01:14.650 --> 01:16.700
The second A is awareness.

01:19.250 --> 01:22.900
Having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three-year-old,...

01:23.550 --> 01:25.250
...because you all used to be three years old.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.550
That three-year-old boy is still part of you.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.500
That three-year-old girl is still part of you.

01:30.200 --> 01:31.000
They're in there.

01:31.616 --> 01:33.747
And being aware is just about remembering...

01:33.834 --> 01:38.057
...that you saw everything you've seen for the first time once, too.

01:40.350 --> 01:43.150
The last A is authenticity.

01:43.300 --> 01:46.650
It's just about being you and being cool with that.

01:47.100 --> 01:50.050
And I think when you're authentic, you end up following your heart,...

01:50.450 --> 01:53.500
...and you put yourself in places and situations...

01:53.600 --> 01:56.350
...and in conversations that you love and that you enjoy.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.200
You meet people that you like talking to.

01:58.250 --> 02:00.000
You go places you've dreamt about...

02:00.450 --> 02:03.750
...and you end up following your heart and feeling very fulfilled.
