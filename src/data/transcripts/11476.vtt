Hello, and hello!

00:04.100 --> 00:09.700
Welcome to the 68th Annual Golden Globe Awards live in the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles.

00:10.050 --> 00:12.850
It's gonna be a night of partying and heavy drinking...

00:15.300 --> 00:17.450
...or as Charlie Sheen calls it, "breakfast".

00:18.950 --> 00:20.500
What did he do on New Year's Eve?

00:22.050 --> 00:22.950
Anyway, welcome!

00:23.150 --> 00:27.000
The Golden Globes is a celebration of the best in TV and movies over the last year...

00:27.250 --> 00:30.000
...voted for by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.

00:30.350 --> 00:32.150
It was a big year for 3D movies:...

00:32.400 --> 00:35.050
...Toy Story, Despicable Me, Tron.

00:35.300 --> 00:37.500
It seems like everything this year was three-dimensional...

00:38.200 --> 00:39.800
...except the characters in The Tourist.

00:40.650 --> 00:43.050
It must be good 'cause it's nominated.

00:43.150 --> 00:44.850
So, shut up, okay?

00:46.350 --> 00:49.750
And I'd like to quash this ridiculous rumor going around...

00:49.950 --> 00:51.950
...that the only reason The Tourist was nominated...

00:52.200 --> 00:55.800
...was so the Hollywood Foreign Press could hang out with Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie.

00:56.700 --> 00:57.800
That is rubbish.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.500
That is not the only reason.

00:59.750 --> 01:01.400
They also accepted bribes.

01:08.800 --> 01:15.150
No, all that happened was some of them were taken to see Cher in concert.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.400
How the hell is that a bribe?

01:17.650 --> 01:19.700
Really? Do you wanna go see Cher?

01:19.950 --> 01:20.350
No!

01:21.700 --> 01:22.200
Why not?

01:22.400 --> 01:24.500
'Cause it's not 1975.

01:29.900 --> 01:32.300
There's been some great new TV drama this year...

01:32.350 --> 01:37.250
...like Boardwalk Empire and The Walking Dead. So, yeah!

01:41.550 --> 01:43.150
Talking of The Walking Dead,...

01:43.550 --> 01:50.700
...congratulations to Hugh Hefner who's getting married, at the age of 84,...

01:50.800 --> 01:53.350
...to 24-year-old beauty Crystal Harris.

01:54.150 --> 01:55.900
When she was asked why she was marrying him,...

01:56.100 --> 01:57.800
...she said, "'Cause he lied about his age,"...

01:58.900 --> 02:00.600
..."he told me he was 94."

02:00.750 --> 02:01.725
Oh, come on!
