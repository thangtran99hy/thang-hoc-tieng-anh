00:02.300 --> 00:06.800
A miser sold everything he owned and bought some gold with the money he got.

00:07.670 --> 00:10.670
"This gold will never get old," he thought.

00:11.110 --> 00:14.880
"And it cannot break, so I can always sell it when I need money."

00:15.640 --> 00:19.520
"However, gold is easy to steal, so I will bury it."

00:20.420 --> 00:23.990
That same night, he went into a field and buried the gold.

00:24.920 --> 00:28.390
From time to time, he went to the field and would dig up the gold...

00:28.520 --> 00:29.930
...to make sure it was still there,...

00:30.730 --> 00:32.090
...then he would bury it again.

00:32.990 --> 00:37.700
A man who was building a house nearby saw the miser burying the gold again.

00:38.670 --> 00:41.710
One night, the man went into the miser's field,...

00:42.140 --> 00:44.410
...dug up the bar of gold, and stole it.

00:44.970 --> 00:49.280
The miser went to the hole the next day. He could not find the gold.

00:49.910 --> 00:51.480
He was very unhappy!

00:52.250 --> 00:55.150
A friend saw him crying and asked what the matter was.

00:56.020 --> 00:58.320
When the miser told him, the friend said,...

00:58.720 --> 01:01.620
..."Put some stones in the hole and pretend they are gold."

01:02.520 --> 01:04.260
"You didn't use the gold when you had it,...

01:04.790 --> 01:07.960
...so it doesn't matter that there will only be stones in the hole."
