Over time, humans have continually come up with new ways to communicate.

00:04.150 --> 00:05.600
And while we've come pretty far,...

00:05.850 --> 00:08.200
...there are still some things that don't quite work the way they should.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.700
For instance, consider voicemail,...

00:11.050 --> 00:13.850
...which you can only listen to by calling one number on your phone.

00:14.450 --> 00:16.350
It is stuck in your voicemail system...

00:16.650 --> 00:19.500
...and it deletes itself automatically after two weeks.

00:20.350 --> 00:24.650
Or say, you're trying to reach a friend with a mobile phone, a work phone, and a home phone.

00:25.350 --> 00:29.400
Right now, you might call each number one by one trying to find the person.

00:30.050 --> 00:31.750
And after you finally leave a voicemail,...

00:31.950 --> 00:35.050
...the guy has to call the right voicemail box to find your message.

00:35.700 --> 00:38.800
So, we asked, "What if telephony were reinvented today?"

00:39.550 --> 00:40.100
The result?

00:40.850 --> 00:41.550
Google Voice.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.000
Google Voice gives you lots of cool calling features,...

00:45.250 --> 00:48.200
...no matter what kind of phone you have or which carrier you use.

00:48.900 --> 00:51.700
For instance, if someone calls your Google Voice number,...

00:52.100 --> 00:55.250
...you can have it ring all your phones or none of your phones...

00:55.650 --> 00:57.950
...depending on the time of day or the person calling.

00:58.850 --> 01:01.950
And if you let it go to voicemail, you can listen in before answering...

01:02.650 --> 01:07.850
...or just wait and read a transcript of the message, and maybe send a text message reply for free.

01:08.650 --> 01:11.350
And if you have an unwanted caller, it's easy to block them.

01:12.400 --> 01:15.350
The list of features goes on and on, and keeps growing.

01:15.950 --> 01:21.050
Point being, in short, less annoyances and more awesomeness for free!

01:21.600 --> 01:22.350
So, give it a shot.
