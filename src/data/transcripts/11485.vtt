If you're going on vacation or won't be checking your e-mail for a little while,...

00:03.800 --> 00:08.850
...you can use Gmail's Vacation responder to let people know you won't be able to get back to them right away.

00:09.150 --> 00:11.050
To set it up, click "Settings",...

00:14.850 --> 00:16.850
...select "Vacation responder on",...

00:17.200 --> 00:19.400
...and set the dates during which you want it to run.

00:24.100 --> 00:27.150
Then enter the subject and body of your vacation message,...

00:34.050 --> 00:35.050
...and "Save Changes".

00:36.450 --> 00:40.000
Gmail will automatically reply with that message when people e-mail you.
