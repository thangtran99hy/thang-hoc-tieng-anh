00:06.600 --> 00:10.100
It should come as no surprise that water and electronics don't mix.

00:10.500 --> 00:13.550
But don't panic, your cell phone can be saved.

00:14.750 --> 00:15.400
You will need...

00:15.900 --> 00:17.550
...a plastic container with a lid,...

00:18.050 --> 00:19.850
...a blow dryer, a towel,...

00:20.250 --> 00:22.050
...and two silica gel packs.

00:23.100 --> 00:25.900
Step 1: Remove your phone's battery.

00:26.450 --> 00:30.650
Many circuits inside the phone will survive if they are not attached to a power source when wet.

00:31.200 --> 00:35.300
Step 2: Consult the manual to remove your phone's SIM card,...

00:35.400 --> 00:38.850
...which stores the phone's data and allows it to connect to your service provider.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.200
SIM cards can survive water damage.

00:42.150 --> 00:46.550
Step 3: Dab the phone, battery, and SIM card with a towel,...

00:46.750 --> 00:48.700
...then set the last two items aside.

00:49.550 --> 00:55.000
Step 4: With your blow dryer set on the low or the cool air blast, dry your phone,...

00:55.150 --> 00:57.400
...getting as much water out of the unit as possible.

00:58.750 --> 01:04.950
Step 5: Place your phone, battery, and SIM card in the plastic container with the silica gel packs.

01:05.250 --> 01:09.550
These absorb moisture and can be found in packaging, craft stores or online.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.800
Allow the container to sit sealed for three days.

01:13.550 --> 01:15.500
If you don't have access to silica gel,...

01:15.750 --> 01:17.800
...place your phone in front of the air conditioner.

01:18.150 --> 01:20.150
The cool air can help dry out moisture.

01:21.100 --> 01:24.800
Step 6: If your phone does not work after three days,...

01:25.050 --> 01:27.150
...plug it into its charger without the battery.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.650
If this works, you will need a new battery.

01:30.700 --> 01:35.650
Step 7: Call up everyone to explain why you haven't returned calls in three days.

01:37.800 --> 01:43.350
Did you know the first cell phone introduced in 1984 weighed two pounds,...

01:43.500 --> 01:45.700
...offered a half hour of talk time per charging...

01:45.800 --> 01:48.550
...and retailed for nearly $4,000?
