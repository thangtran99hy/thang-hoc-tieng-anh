00:05.740 --> 00:08.840
Things have changed since Arsalan Kazemi's Iranian parents,...

00:08.940 --> 00:11.710
...enrolled their son at a prep school in North Carolina.

00:12.140 --> 00:15.650
The gamble paid off when basketball powerhouses such as Memphis,...

00:15.750 --> 00:19.850
...Maryland, and Oklahoma State all offered him full athletic scholarships,...

00:20.180 --> 00:22.050
...but Arsalan chose a different offer.

00:22.320 --> 00:25.020
He signed with Rice University in Houston, Texas...

00:25.350 --> 00:27.820
...over other better-known basketball programs.

00:31.930 --> 00:34.700
I didn't want to sit on the bench for an entire year, my freshman year.

00:35.060 --> 00:36.600
It just doesn't work with my mentality.

00:36.830 --> 00:39.470
And secondly, because Rice is a very good school academically,...

00:39.700 --> 00:41.970
...I knew I could get a great job after graduating from here.

00:47.710 --> 00:49.440
That great job may have to wait.

00:49.740 --> 00:52.050
After a successful freshman year at Rice,...

00:52.350 --> 00:56.220
...scouts noticed Arsalan at the Basketball World Championships in Turkey...

00:56.520 --> 00:58.220
...in the summer of 2010.

01:01.690 --> 01:03.550
In my first year here, everyone talked about me...

01:03.650 --> 01:06.860
...being the first-ever Iranian to receive a scholarship in the NCAA.

01:07.430 --> 01:09.860
That's why it was such a good feeling after the World Championships.

01:10.030 --> 01:14.040
Then, everyone, all the reporters all of a sudden started talking about basketball with me...

01:14.270 --> 01:17.470
...and telling me I'm a great player, and that I have a future. It was a great feeling.

01:23.150 --> 01:30.050
A reporter for Slam Magazine picked Arsalan as one of the top five NBA draft prospects of the tournament.

01:34.890 --> 01:37.530
After this year, I would really like to sign up for the draft,...

01:37.830 --> 01:40.230
...practice with teams to compare myself to other players,...

01:40.400 --> 01:42.200
...and see what areas I need to improve upon.

01:42.630 --> 01:44.500
Then, come back for my junior year at Rice,...

01:44.730 --> 01:47.430
...work on those areas, and then make my move fully after that season.
