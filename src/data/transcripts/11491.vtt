Hello! Welcome to Michael's Better Business English!

00:04.350 --> 00:07.200
This month, we're looking at how to interrupt.

00:08.100 --> 00:12.350
Now, this is quite a difficult skill for many Japanese business people...

00:12.700 --> 00:15.500
...and the main reason is culture difference.

00:16.650 --> 00:20.200
There are big differences between cultures in interrupting style.

00:21.050 --> 00:24.650
For example, in Japan, often it's not polite to interrupt.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.550
People instead wait for a long silence as an opportunity.

00:29.450 --> 00:32.650
However, in other cultures such as America or Europe,...

00:33.000 --> 00:35.100
...interrupting is much more accepted.

00:35.700 --> 00:38.150
And we often use much shorter silences.

00:38.950 --> 00:40.700
So, how can you do this?

00:41.300 --> 00:43.450
Here are four steps to help you.

00:44.350 --> 00:46.450
First, silence.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.550
As I mentioned, don't wait for a long silence.

00:50.750 --> 00:53.400
It might never happen in an English business meeting.

00:54.650 --> 00:57.600
Second, use body language.

00:57.850 --> 01:02.350
Leaning forward, making eye contact with the speaker, making a gesture,...

01:02.800 --> 01:06.700
...that's a good way to catch the attention of the speaker and help you interrupt.

01:08.550 --> 01:11.150
Third, project your voice.

01:11.900 --> 01:14.100
Don't speak down into the table.

01:14.450 --> 01:17.600
Instead, project your voice loudly and clearly,...

01:18.050 --> 01:21.150
...then there's more chance you'll interrupt successfully.

01:22.450 --> 01:25.600
And finally, use people's names.

01:25.950 --> 01:28.321
John, Mary, Michael.

01:28.806 --> 01:30.423
If you use somebody's name,...

01:30.450 --> 01:35.250
...people catch that very clearly and they will automatically stop speaking.

01:36.050 --> 01:40.450
So, for example, "John, may I interrupt? How much did you say?"

01:41.200 --> 01:45.200
Use these four techniques to help you interrupt successfully.

01:46.050 --> 01:47.400
Thank you and good luck!
