Some say Apple just wouldn't be Apple without Steve Jobs.

00:12.963 --> 00:16.453
Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone.

00:16.670 --> 00:19.651
So, it came as no surprise that Apple shares plunged Monday...

00:19.945 --> 00:24.055
...after the man who built the first Apple computers in his garage in 1976,...

00:24.384 --> 00:28.752
...and later introduced the world to the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad,...

00:29.004 --> 00:32.203
...suddenly announced his second medical leave in two years.

00:32.609 --> 00:37.311
New York Times Technology writer Nick Bilton says the news caught many by surprise.

00:37.449 --> 00:39.382
I think this news came completely out of nowhere...

00:39.447 --> 00:42.511
...and nobody knows what's going on, or how long he's gonna be gone for.

00:42.813 --> 00:46.729
Known for his secrecy, Jobs is a survivor of pancreatic cancer.

00:46.947 --> 00:49.492
Receiving a liver transplant in 2009...

00:49.781 --> 00:54.345
...after initially claiming his medical problems were the result of a hormone imbalance.

00:54.604 --> 00:56.209
Despite the initial hit on Monday,...

00:56.304 --> 01:00.152
...which saw the company lose as much as 20 billion dollars in market value,...

01:00.577 --> 01:05.128
...analysts say, Apple shares are set to rebound after better than expected earnings.

01:05.449 --> 01:10.346
Apple reported a blockbuster quarter late Tuesday with revenues up 71%.

01:10.781 --> 01:15.399
That means, holiday shoppers snapped up more iPhones and iPads than analysts expected.

01:15.817 --> 01:17.600
But the Wall Street Journal's Kara Swisher...

01:17.671 --> 01:21.524
...questions the company's long-term future without its charismatic founder.

01:21.859 --> 01:23.680
There is no replacement for Steve Jobs.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.907
It's hard to find a successor to someone like him.

01:26.223 --> 01:27.554
Based on the latest earnings,...

01:27.651 --> 01:31.754
...analysts say Apple is on track to sell more than 17 million iPods,...

01:32.041 --> 01:36.203
...15 million iPhones, and more than 6 million iPads in 2011,...

01:36.417 --> 01:38.513
...with or without Steve Jobs.
