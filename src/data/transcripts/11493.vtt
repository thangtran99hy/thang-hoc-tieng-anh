00:02.750 --> 00:04.820
First, how do you get to high school in America?

00:05.070 --> 00:10.710
Well, when I was in high school or junior high, there's no Internet, so I can't...

00:11.870 --> 00:13.880
...like look up things in America.

00:14.110 --> 00:19.850
So, I bought this magazine called "Ryugaku Journal"...

00:20.050 --> 00:20.350
Uh-huh!

00:20.450 --> 00:26.120
...and they listed all the schools, high schools in America like East Coast, West Coast,...

00:26.450 --> 00:26.760
Wow!

00:27.290 --> 00:34.030
...and I looked for the schools, high schools with no Japanese students,...

00:34.930 --> 00:36.620
Cool! Good approach.

00:37.400 --> 00:41.870
...'cause I didn't know any other way. I mean, how can I compare, you know.

00:41.970 --> 00:43.910
Sure. Well, that's brave of you though.

00:44.740 --> 00:48.180
A lot of exchange students choose high schools or schools...

00:48.380 --> 00:50.480
...with a lot of Japanese people, so they'll have friends.

00:50.580 --> 00:54.420
Yeah. And I refused to take up ESL.

00:54.920 --> 00:55.280
Really?

00:55.380 --> 01:03.650
Yeah, because if you're to begin with surrounded by like no known speakers, how can you speak?

01:03.930 --> 01:08.660
Yeah, like my wife. Let's say my friend went to America and...

01:09.530 --> 01:15.740
...took two months of English study at an ESL or any English as a second language school,...

01:16.170 --> 01:19.670
...and she came back to Japan speaking English like a Mexican...

01:21.540 --> 01:23.180
...she's like, "Hey! It's very hot today".

01:25.080 --> 01:25.450
You know?

01:28.180 --> 01:28.550
Yeah.

01:29.820 --> 01:31.390
But have you had a lot of Mexican teachers?

01:32.050 --> 01:36.590
No. But actually, my ESL, I didn't pay...

01:36.720 --> 01:43.100
...those classes taught by a French teacher who, you know, has a thick, French accent.

01:43.250 --> 01:44.000
Yeah. Yeah.

01:44.100 --> 01:44.300
Yeah.

01:44.470 --> 01:48.340
Well, it's the same as, you know, a lot of American kids learn Japanese from an American teacher.

01:48.570 --> 01:48.750
Yeah.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.640
And so, they come and say something like, "Watashi wa",...

01:51.240 --> 01:53.270
..."watashi wa onaka ga suita".

01:54.540 --> 01:56.280
Yeah. But, you know, what can you do?
