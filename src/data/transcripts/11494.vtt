00:08.670 --> 00:10.110
The streets can be rough.

00:11.370 --> 00:12.440
Don't be this guy.

00:13.780 --> 00:16.950
A few simple precautions will keep the muggers off your back.

00:17.750 --> 00:22.950
You will need pockets, worn clothing, and an angry glare.

00:23.820 --> 00:26.620
Step 1: Put away that iPod.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.360
Stick it in your pocket till you're somewhere safe.

00:32.260 --> 00:36.110
Step 2: If you carry a wallet, don't keep it in your back pocket.

00:36.900 --> 00:38.430
Instead, put it in your front pocket.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.970
Better still, keep money in your socks.

00:45.480 --> 00:51.450
Step 3: Instead of a pink polo, try a white t-shirt with stains.

00:53.480 --> 00:57.950
If you must wear expensive clothes, consider buying a cheap jacket at a thrift store.

00:58.220 --> 01:00.990
Once you're at your destination, you can just throw it away.

01:01.560 --> 01:05.800
Step 4: Stop staring up at the buildings like a tourist.

01:06.050 --> 01:11.870
Try to seem familiar with your environment. Periodically yell, "Benny, where you at?"

01:13.540 --> 01:16.770
Step 5: Adapt an angry glare.

01:18.270 --> 01:21.940
If you're having trouble looking mad, imagine you've just bought a used TV,...

01:22.180 --> 01:25.210
...but when you got it home and plugged it in, it was broke!

01:26.180 --> 01:31.620
Step 6: While maintaining your angry glare, do your best to project confidence.

01:32.290 --> 01:34.560
Like dogs, muggers can smell fear.

01:34.990 --> 01:39.890
Pretend that you're a judo master or that you have retractable adamantium claws.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.570
By now, the thieves will be looking for another target.

01:48.170 --> 01:51.140
Did you know because of its tiny number of residents,...

01:51.370 --> 01:56.010
...Vatican City has the highest per capita crime rate of any country in the world?
