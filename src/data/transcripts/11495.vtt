A lion fell in love with a woodcutter's daughter...

00:04.930 --> 00:07.070
...and told the man to let the girl marry him.

00:07.770 --> 00:10.710
The woodcutter and his daughter were very afraid of the lion.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.980
The woodcutter knew that if he did not let the lion marry his daughter,...

00:15.380 --> 00:18.880
...the lion would get very angry and would kill, and eat them both.

00:19.880 --> 00:23.690
The woodcutter knew that somehow, he had to find a way of killing the lion.

00:24.520 --> 00:27.120
After a lot of thought, he said to the lion,...

00:27.690 --> 00:29.890
..."I will be pleased for you to marry my daughter,...

00:30.560 --> 00:33.060
...but she is very afraid of your teeth and claws."

00:33.830 --> 00:36.700
"If you will let me take them all out, you can marry her."

00:37.300 --> 00:39.800
"I am sure my daughter will then make you a good wife."

00:40.940 --> 00:43.810
The lion could think only of how much he loved the girl...

00:44.140 --> 00:45.470
...and wanted her for a wife.

00:46.310 --> 00:50.050
So, he let the woodcutter take out all his teeth and claws.

00:51.010 --> 00:53.520
As soon as the lion was toothless and clawless,...

00:53.850 --> 00:56.350
...the woodcutter began hitting him with a heavy stick.

00:56.890 --> 01:01.190
The lion could not defend himself without teeth or claws, so he ran away.

01:02.120 --> 01:05.730
He was also unable to kill for food, so he soon died.
