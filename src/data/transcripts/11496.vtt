When Alice came to the house, she saw the Hatter and the Hare having a tea party.

00:08.400 --> 00:12.500
It was a large table and only three creatures were sitting around it.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.400
However, as Alice walked towards it, they cried,...

00:17.400 --> 00:19.900
..."No room! No room!"

00:20.300 --> 00:23.550
"Nonsense," said Alice, "there's plenty of room."

00:24.100 --> 00:27.850
"Why is a raven like a desk?" The Hatter asked.

00:28.550 --> 00:29.750
Alice liked riddles.

00:29.900 --> 00:32.550
"I believe I can guess that," she said.

00:32.750 --> 00:35.100
"Do you mean," the Hare asked,...

00:35.150 --> 00:38.250
..."that you think you can find the answer to that riddle?"

00:39.250 --> 00:41.250
"Yes," Alice answered.

00:41.350 --> 00:44.350
"Then, you should say what you mean." the Hare said.

00:44.550 --> 00:46.650
"I usually do," Alice said,...

00:46.700 --> 00:48.100
..."and I mean what I say."

00:48.400 --> 00:49.650
"That's the same thing."

00:50.700 --> 00:55.400
"Have you guessed the answer to the riddle yet?" The Hatter asked.

00:55.900 --> 00:58.750
"No, I give up," Alice told him.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.400
"I don't know either." the Hatter said.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.900
"Neither do I." the Hare said.

01:05.750 --> 01:09.850
"Haven't you anything better to do than ask riddles that have no answer?"

01:10.050 --> 01:11.450
Alice asked angrily.
