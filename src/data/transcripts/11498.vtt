00:03.000 --> 00:05.500
Mother Wolf saw a movement among the trees.

00:06.500 --> 00:09.000
"Something is coming," she said.

00:09.500 --> 00:12.950
Father Wolf got ready to jump at whatever came out of the trees.

00:13.800 --> 00:17.050
But to his surprise, it was not an animal.

00:17.900 --> 00:19.150
It was a man's cub.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.250
A little brown baby.

00:22.300 --> 00:25.900
At this moment, Shere Khan came to the mouth of the cave.

00:26.950 --> 00:31.100
"I am looking for a man's cub," Shere Khan said.

00:31.850 --> 00:34.950
"His parents were afraid of me and they ran off."

00:35.550 --> 00:37.450
"Now, I can eat their child."

00:38.550 --> 00:41.600
Father Wolf said, "The man cub is ours."

00:42.200 --> 00:46.350
Shere Khan roared, "You have no right to keep the child."

00:47.150 --> 00:50.800
Then, Mother Wolf shouted at the tiger, "Go away!"

00:51.450 --> 00:55.100
"The child stays with us and will run with our family."

00:55.750 --> 01:00.800
Shere Khan roared, "The wolf pack will decide, not you",...

01:01.200 --> 01:03.650
..."if a man's cub can run with the pack."

01:04.400 --> 01:07.500
Father Wolf said, "Shere Khan is right, Mother."

01:08.050 --> 01:10.550
"The pack will decide if he may run with us."

01:11.150 --> 01:15.000
"We will take Mowgli, for this is what I shall call him",...

01:15.500 --> 01:19.000
..."to the pack at the next full moon," Mother Wolf said.

01:19.400 --> 01:27.550
Time passed, and Mother, and Father Wolf took Mowgli to where Akela, the great, gray wolf who led the pack...

01:27.850 --> 01:29.350
...was lying outside his cave.
