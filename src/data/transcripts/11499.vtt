In 1810, a live burial happened in France.

00:06.030 --> 00:10.170
She was a beautiful girl from a good family called Victorine Lafourcade...

00:10.610 --> 00:13.680
...and was loved by a poor Frenchman named Julien Bossuet.

00:14.180 --> 00:17.350
However, because he was poor, she decided not to marry him.

00:17.580 --> 00:19.750
Instead, she married Monsieur Renelle.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.650
After a few unhappy years of marriage, she died.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.650
She was buried in a grave in her home village.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.820
Julien Bossuet was alone and sad.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.960
He had never forgotten his deep love for Victorine.

00:32.590 --> 00:36.100
He went to the village, planning to cut off a lock of her hair.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.230
He quietly dug up the body.

00:38.870 --> 00:40.240
As he was cutting the hair,...

00:40.340 --> 00:44.610
...Victorine suddenly opened her eyes, waking from her unconscious state.

00:45.210 --> 00:46.810
She had been buried alive!

00:47.080 --> 00:51.010
Once more, she loved Bossuet. And this time, she wanted to stay with him.

00:51.380 --> 00:53.880
She did not let her husband know she was alive.

00:54.280 --> 00:57.490
Julien and Victorine lived together happily until they were old.
