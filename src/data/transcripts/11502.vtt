00:04.750 --> 00:05.650
You're nice, baby.

00:05.900 --> 00:06.350
Thanks.

00:09.650 --> 00:10.150
Hello!

00:10.450 --> 00:10.950
Hey!

00:11.150 --> 00:12.350
Laura, this is Joanna, my wife.

00:12.500 --> 00:13.500
Hi, nice to meet you.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.950
Laura is the new designer that we've been working with.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.150
Did you just say new?

00:20.950 --> 00:22.500
I've been here like three months.

00:26.150 --> 00:28.000
You didn't tell me anything about her before tonight.

00:28.150 --> 00:29.450
'Cause it makes you like this, baby.

00:30.150 --> 00:32.550
I mean, seriously, did you think that I just wouldn't notice?

00:32.850 --> 00:33.900
You two already slept together?

00:34.500 --> 00:35.450
There's nothing going on.

00:35.700 --> 00:37.550
Is she going to Philadelphia with you and Andy tomorrow?

00:37.800 --> 00:39.100
Laura's just someone I work with.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.500
Michael, it'd kill you if you knew how much I knew about you.

00:45.350 --> 00:45.550
Hey.

00:45.750 --> 00:45.950
Hey.

00:54.000 --> 00:54.400
Joanna.

00:57.700 --> 00:59.250
Alex, what are you doing here?

00:59.350 --> 01:00.200
I have some work here.

01:01.350 --> 01:02.300
I can't believe this.

01:02.550 --> 01:03.400
And I leave tomorrow.

01:04.000 --> 01:04.850
Do you have time for me now?

01:05.200 --> 01:05.850
Yeah.

01:06.800 --> 01:07.350
Yeah, sure.

01:08.750 --> 01:10.500
I had no idea you were seeing someone in New York.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.600
Oh, no. We're just good friends.

01:15.350 --> 01:17.400
Remind me why it didn't work.

01:17.650 --> 01:18.550
Geography.

01:18.850 --> 01:19.250
What are you drinking?

01:19.600 --> 01:20.100
Scotch.

01:21.450 --> 01:22.000
And timing.

01:22.950 --> 01:23.800
I'd love another drink.

01:24.250 --> 01:24.500
Okay.

01:24.750 --> 01:25.350
Just not here.

01:28.100 --> 01:29.150
Are you getting a divorce?

01:29.450 --> 01:29.950
No.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.950
So, have you ever been cheated on?

01:33.650 --> 01:33.850
No.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.200
I've never told him about us.

01:43.550 --> 01:45.200
Why? Would he be angry?

01:48.500 --> 01:50.500
Have you thought about what he might be doing right now?

01:50.950 --> 01:52.150
Michael isn't doing anything.

01:52.250 --> 01:53.850
He could be thinking the same thing about you.
