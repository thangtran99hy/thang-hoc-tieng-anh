00:00.200 --> 00:00.950
How did it go?

00:02.550 --> 00:05.750
I didn't feel anything.

00:05.800 --> 00:06.400
Yeah.

00:10.150 --> 00:11.300
I feel funny.

00:11.850 --> 00:13.200
Kinda felt good, didn't it?

00:16.500 --> 00:18.250
Is this real life?

00:18.350 --> 00:19.700
Yeah, this is real life.

00:23.950 --> 00:27.450
Okay. Now, I have two fingers.

00:28.100 --> 00:28.700
Good.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.900
Now, I have four fingers.

00:31.650 --> 00:32.650
Four fingers?

00:34.100 --> 00:39.900
Na-ah uh-uh! Don't put it in your mouth, okay?

00:44.500 --> 00:45.300
Do you feel good?

00:46.050 --> 00:48.500
I can't see anything.

00:49.000 --> 00:49.850
Yes, you can.

00:53.550 --> 00:54.400
Stay in your seat.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I don't feel tired.

01:04.350 --> 01:04.950
You don't?

01:05.650 --> 01:06.100
Uh-uh.

01:06.500 --> 01:06.950
No?

01:09.150 --> 01:10.800
Do I have stitches?

01:10.900 --> 01:11.400
Uh-huh.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Dad, do I have stitches?

01:15.050 --> 01:15.650
Yes.

01:16.350 --> 01:17.300
On my teeth?

01:17.400 --> 01:19.800
Yeah, don't touch it. Don't!

01:22.150 --> 01:24.200
Why can't I touch it?

01:24.800 --> 01:27.000
Because it'll mess up the stitches.

01:27.050 --> 01:28.650
You have four eyes.

01:28.700 --> 01:29.250
Yeah.

01:31.550 --> 01:32.750
I feel funny.

01:34.350 --> 01:36.850
Why is this happening to me?

01:36.900 --> 01:37.950
It's okay, bud.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.850
It's just from the medicine, okay?

01:41.900 --> 01:44.750
Is this going to be forever?

01:46.500 --> 01:48.050
No, it won't be forever.
