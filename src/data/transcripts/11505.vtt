00:18.510 --> 00:19.180
Give me your hands.

00:22.180 --> 00:23.490
I don't even do this anymore.

00:33.030 --> 00:35.250
Your brother, I'm telling you he's just funny. He's really for real.

00:35.560 --> 00:36.630
He could make money doing this.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.340
For a while, he had an office, a website, newspaper articles, even a book written about him.

00:42.000 --> 00:42.500
So, what happened?

00:42.700 --> 00:43.340
He couldn't cope.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.480
Can I ask you any question?

00:50.050 --> 00:53.110
The job I had before was as a psychic.

00:57.990 --> 00:59.960
What do you think happens when we die?

01:04.160 --> 01:06.460
I recognize you, you're that psychic.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.460
I have news for you, I don't do it anymore.

01:12.270 --> 01:14.400
I give you my word, I won't tell anyone.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.430
You have a duty to do it 'cause you have a gift.

01:16.570 --> 01:18.370
It's not a gift, Billy. It's a curse.

01:32.590 --> 01:34.260
But I think you experienced death.

01:48.240 --> 01:52.610
Listen, listen. Everything I have, I've lost!

01:56.310 --> 01:59.280
If you are worried about being on your own, don't be.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.120
You're not.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.230
Hereafter.
