00:02.660 --> 00:03.970
Sign the confession.

00:04.070 --> 00:04.500
No.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.030
Kindness can kill you here.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.520
If you are serious about making a run for it,...

00:28.320 --> 00:29.000
...I'm with you.

00:31.990 --> 00:32.790
We must keep going.

00:32.890 --> 00:34.600
The snow is blinding us.

00:34.750 --> 00:38.130
Don't you see? This is perfect! They'll never find us like this.

00:40.200 --> 00:40.870
We're lost.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.210
Someone has been following us.

00:52.580 --> 00:52.880
No!

00:53.680 --> 00:54.650
She needs protection.

00:54.980 --> 00:56.750
We can barely feed ourselves.

00:57.090 --> 00:57.920
She comes with us.

00:58.720 --> 00:59.450
They will kill us all.

00:59.550 --> 01:00.790
We're already dying.

01:08.060 --> 01:09.050
It tastes like chicken.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.830
Yeah, a big, black poisonous chicken with no legs.

01:16.600 --> 01:19.040
In a way, we'll never be able to forgive ourselves.

01:19.340 --> 01:20.640
I have to get back.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.410
Go over the Himalayas?

01:22.510 --> 01:22.810
How?

01:23.150 --> 01:23.710
We walk.

01:27.450 --> 01:28.150
Run!

01:49.640 --> 01:50.540
Just keep walking.
