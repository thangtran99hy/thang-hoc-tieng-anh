00:02.000 --> 00:07.500
Once upon a time, a poor soldier was walking along a road when he met the Devil.

00:08.250 --> 00:12.300
"I will make you a rich man," the Devil said.

00:12.550 --> 00:16.950
"But if you die within seven years, I shall take your soul."

00:17.700 --> 00:21.300
"What must I do for the seven years?" The soldier asked.

00:22.100 --> 00:24.150
The Devil was wearing a green coat.

00:24.450 --> 00:27.250
He took it off and he gave it to the soldier.

00:27.850 --> 00:30.700
"There is a pocket in this coat," he said.

00:31.300 --> 00:33.900
The soldier put his hand into the pocket.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.200
"It's full of gold!" He said.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.200
"Yes," the Devil said.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.300
"You can spend as much as you like."

00:40.600 --> 00:42.700
"The pocket will stay full of gold."

00:43.050 --> 00:43.950
"Now, don't forget."

00:44.250 --> 00:46.600
"You must not take off the bearskin."

00:46.900 --> 00:48.350
"You must not take a bath."

00:48.650 --> 00:51.450
"And you must not cut your beard or your hair."

00:52.100 --> 00:56.600
"If you are still alive in seven years' time, I will make you rich."

00:57.000 --> 00:59.950
"If you die before then, I shall take your soul."

01:00.500 --> 01:05.100
With these words, the Devil vanished and the soldier started walking.
