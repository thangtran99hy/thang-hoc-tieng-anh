00:02.800 --> 00:07.000
Rapunzel was a beautiful child who grew into an even more beautiful young woman.

00:07.850 --> 00:10.350
For a time, the witch took good care of her,...

00:10.750 --> 00:15.250
...but when Rapunzel turned 16, she locked her in a room at the top of a tower.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.800
When the witch wanted to speak to Rapunzel, she shouted,...

00:19.250 --> 00:22.950
..."Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair."

00:23.750 --> 00:26.000
One day, a young prince came by the tower.

00:26.900 --> 00:28.700
"Come away with me," he said.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
"We will get married."

00:30.450 --> 00:32.950
"I would like to," Rapunzel said,...

00:33.050 --> 00:35.350
..."But, how can I get down?"

00:35.650 --> 00:37.050
Then she had an idea.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.900
"Bring me some silk every time you come," she said.

00:41.150 --> 00:43.200
"I will spin it into a rope."

00:43.950 --> 00:48.450
Then one day Rapunzel, who was beautiful but not very clever, said to the witch,...

00:49.000 --> 00:53.200
..."Why is it that you are much heavier than the prince who comes here every day?"

00:53.950 --> 00:57.250
"You wicked girl!" the witch said.

00:57.350 --> 00:59.700
"I shall put a stop to that."

01:00.750 --> 01:03.600
And with these words, she cut off Rapunzel's hair.

01:04.100 --> 01:06.600
She took the girl into the desert and left her there.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.650
Then she went back to the tower and waited for the prince.

01:10.500 --> 01:15.200
"You'll never find Rapunzel alive," the witch shouted at him.

01:15.350 --> 01:16.900
"She's in the desert."

01:17.100 --> 01:20.000
"By the time you find her, she'll be dead."

01:20.500 --> 01:23.100
The prince, who was not badly hurt, rode away.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.000
He looked everywhere for Rapunzel.

01:25.500 --> 01:27.900
Then at last, many years later, he found her.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.100
"I am now king," the prince said.

01:31.450 --> 01:35.550
"You shall be my queen, and our two sons shall be princes."

01:36.250 --> 01:39.100
He married Rapunzel and they lived happily together.
