And finally today, some Japanese are jump-starting the holiday celebrations for the Year of the Rabbit.

00:06.770 --> 00:11.210
These rabbit owners are dressing up their pets and having a hopping good time.

00:12.210 --> 00:15.380
At Bunny Family just south of Tokyo, on Tuesday,...

00:15.480 --> 00:18.010
...bunny owners primp their pets for the New Year.

00:18.650 --> 00:22.320
They're hoping to immortalize their furry bundle in a photo session.

00:22.620 --> 00:27.540
While most of Asia remains faithful to the Chinese lunar calendar for the Lunar New Year,...

00:27.760 --> 00:30.760
...Japan uses the Western style calendar for both.

00:31.130 --> 00:35.750
It makes New Year's Day the start of 2011 and the Year of the Rabbit.

00:35.930 --> 00:39.500
The bunnies are given a total makeover with Japanese kimonos.

00:39.770 --> 00:41.340
They're then put in the spotlight...

00:41.440 --> 00:45.240
...with their owners hoping to use the photos for holiday greeting cards.

00:45.950 --> 00:47.910
Since it's the Year of the Rabbit next year,...

00:48.140 --> 00:51.110
I'm going to use this photo for my New Year's greeting cards.

00:51.480 --> 00:55.850
I mean, it's the only year in a while I will be able to take pictures like this.

00:56.420 --> 00:58.250
With Christmas just around the corner,...

00:58.420 --> 01:02.690
...some owners dress up their rabbits in Santa and other Christmas costumes.

01:02.930 --> 01:08.360
Local housewife Yuki Shibahara has groomed her three-year-old Choco into a pretty princess,...

01:08.630 --> 01:10.970
...complete with glittery cape and tiara.

01:11.200 --> 01:17.040
Shibahara says she's hoping the Year of the Rabbit will be leaps and bounds better than previous years.

01:18.440 --> 01:22.210
Choco has never been sick so I hope he continues to be healthy next year.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.150
As for myself, I've been living with rabbits...

01:25.250 --> 01:27.250
...and since it's the Year of the Rabbit next year,...

01:27.520 --> 01:31.750
...I hope to make it a healthy and joyful year that leaps past bad times.

01:33.490 --> 01:35.020
According to the lunar calendar,...

01:35.120 --> 01:38.230
...the rabbit is an animal that will bring endurance and peace...

01:38.530 --> 01:41.530
...after the fierce and energetic Year of the Tiger.

01:41.800 --> 01:45.970
Over 180 bunnies have had their photo taken at Bunny Family...

01:46.100 --> 01:49.370
...since the store first launched the photo shoot event in November.
