And in South Korea a zoo is already celebrating the upcoming Year of the Rabbit.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.670
Let's see how they're doing it.

00:07.670 --> 00:12.400
Visitors at this South Korean zoo were greeted by rabbits in traditional Korean costumes...

00:12.540 --> 00:14.240
...in an early New Year's treat.

00:14.680 --> 00:19.810
The fluffy bunnies, Flemish Giant rabbits, and two Rex rabbits, were a hit with the children.

00:20.780 --> 00:24.250
I used to raise a rabbit, but it was small and not exciting enough.

00:24.450 --> 00:26.720
But this rabbit is really big and fun to play with.

00:30.460 --> 00:34.160
Next year is the Year of the Rabbit on the Chinese zodiac calendar.

00:35.030 --> 00:39.000
Rabbits have been symbolizing fortune and richness since old times.

00:39.330 --> 00:44.170
So, the Everland zoo is exhibiting rabbits and has prepared various events.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.880
Come look at these and get a good fortune.

00:52.480 --> 00:56.950
According to the Chinese lunar calendar, the New Year begins on February 3rd.
