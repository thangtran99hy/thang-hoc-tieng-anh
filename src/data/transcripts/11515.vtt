Have you ever forgotten to stock your fridge with your favorite soda or beer?

00:03.800 --> 00:04.750
I know I have.

00:04.900 --> 00:08.600
You're really thirsty and all you're left with is that room temperature soda.

00:08.700 --> 00:12.100
I'm gonna show you how to super chill a Coke in two minutes.

00:12.350 --> 00:14.650
A room temperature soda is pretty nasty,...

00:14.750 --> 00:16.850
...almost 80 degrees right out of the can.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
But here's all you need to do to super chill it.

00:19.200 --> 00:23.050
Depending on how many you wanna chill, get yourself a bowl with ice and water in it.

00:23.250 --> 00:26.200
Then take ordinary salt, about a handful,...

00:26.400 --> 00:28.300
...and put it in with the ice - water mixture.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.650
Then, load up your drinks and stir them around.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.750
This is the second law of thermodynamics.

00:32.850 --> 00:35.600
Basically, the salt reduces the freezing point of the water...

00:35.750 --> 00:37.750
...and allows it to become super chilled.

00:37.850 --> 00:39.000
Okay, two minutes is up.

00:39.100 --> 00:41.550
Let's take the thermometer from that room temperature Coke...

00:41.600 --> 00:43.950
...and put it in the one we just super chilled.

00:44.150 --> 00:47.000
Check it out! In two minutes, 43 degrees.

00:47.100 --> 00:50.200
That's about the perfect temperature for a nice, cold Coke.

00:50.450 --> 00:53.000
This will work with just about any drink, in a can or a bottle.

00:53.200 --> 00:56.100
So, the next time you're dry, super chill your drink.
