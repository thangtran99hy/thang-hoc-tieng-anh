I'm Annie Leung and I just broke the Guinness World Record...

00:12.800 --> 00:15.700
...Guitar Hero 3, the highest score for females.

00:20.580 --> 00:24.120
It's really exciting to be able to be in the Guinness World Records.

00:24.350 --> 00:29.090
I'm so excited that my score is able to be out there for everyone to see...

00:29.220 --> 00:30.980
...and it's like the ultimate achievement.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.660
It's gonna be written down and remembered for many years to come.

00:36.830 --> 00:38.300
So, it's definitely really cool.

00:39.140 --> 00:42.040
Being a female in gaming is really hard, actually,...

00:42.200 --> 00:47.410
...because there's a lot of harassment sometimes, and guys kind of underestimate you.

00:47.510 --> 00:51.580
But, you know, I've put a lot of hard work, and commitment into it, and proven myself that...

00:51.750 --> 00:55.150
...I'm just as good and just as much of a threat as anybody out there.

00:55.850 --> 00:58.550
I'm from California. It's where I was born and raised.

00:59.250 --> 01:03.430
Right now, I'm 25 and I recently just graduated from college,...

01:03.590 --> 01:08.660
...and I'm a gamer on the side. It's my hobby and I love it. So, yeah.

01:09.930 --> 01:12.400
The thing about Guitar Hero that I love is...

01:12.500 --> 01:16.600
...the walk and the music. It really gets me going...

01:16.700 --> 01:19.800
...because that's the music that I listen to on a regular basis.

01:19.900 --> 01:23.850
So, it's really fun to be able to play it at home and...

01:24.670 --> 01:27.220
...I don't play the guitar, but it's really awesome to just...

01:27.520 --> 01:29.350
...feel like I am and rocking out to the songs.

01:30.920 --> 01:36.680
I think my friends would be really amazed and excited for me that now I'm this new record holder.

01:37.790 --> 01:42.930
They've always, you know, been gamers too, so they would definitely be really into it, and supportive.

01:44.870 --> 01:50.340
I think this record will hopefully lead to open the doors to many more records.

01:50.670 --> 01:53.540
And I would love to, you know, set as many as I can,...

01:53.640 --> 02:02.050
...and just promote more females to compete and get into gaming and, you know, increase your skill level. So, yeah.
