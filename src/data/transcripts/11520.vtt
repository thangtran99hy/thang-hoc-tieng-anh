Having less than brilliant teeth doesn't have to mean a trip to the dentist or a whitening kit.

00:10.440 --> 00:12.400
Try this all natural remedy instead.

00:13.010 --> 00:19.410
You will need, baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, a small bowl, a toothbrush, and plastic wrap.

00:19.820 --> 00:23.420
Optional, mint flavoring and cranberry juice.

00:23.820 --> 00:28.990
Do not whiten teeth if you have cavities, open sores, gingivitis, or other gum disease.

00:29.390 --> 00:35.230
Step one: In a small bowl, mix two teaspoons each of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide.

00:35.430 --> 00:38.030
Stir until it is the consistency of regular toothpaste.

00:38.330 --> 00:40.180
You may need to add a bit more peroxide.

00:40.700 --> 00:42.900
Add a drop or two of sugar-free mint flavoring.

00:43.270 --> 00:47.740
Step two: Apply the whitener to a toothbrush and use it as if it were regular toothpaste.

00:47.940 --> 00:50.550
Leave the whitener on your teeth for at least two minutes.

00:51.050 --> 00:52.950
Step three: Rinse thoroughly.

00:53.150 --> 00:54.950
Do not swallow the whitener solution.

00:55.450 --> 00:58.410
Try rinsing with cranberry juice to get rid of the whitener's taste.

00:58.550 --> 00:59.820
It also kills bacteria.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.700
Step four: Cover the bowl with a plastic wrap...

01:02.800 --> 01:05.190
...and set the extra whitener aside for another use.

01:05.630 --> 01:09.430
Step five. Brush with the peroxide paste no more than once a week.

01:09.630 --> 01:12.530
Hydrogen peroxide can cause tissue damage if used too often.

01:13.170 --> 01:16.600
Did you know, tooth enamel is the hardest tissue in the human body?
