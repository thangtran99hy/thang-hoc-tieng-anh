00:01.400 --> 00:03.160
My family name is Frankenstein.

00:03.530 --> 00:07.740
I am a Genevese and my family is one of the most important in that country.

00:08.300 --> 00:11.540
When I was about fifteen years old, there was a bad storm.

00:12.010 --> 00:14.010
Lightning struck a tree near our house.

00:14.680 --> 00:16.310
It completely destroyed the tree.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.120
Until this time, I had not studied electricity.

00:19.580 --> 00:21.650
But now, I lost interest in everything else.

00:21.950 --> 00:24.590
My new interest was to lead to my own destruction.

00:24.790 --> 00:29.620
From this time, science, especially chemistry and electricity, was my main interest.

00:29.990 --> 00:33.900
I read widely, attended the lectures, and got to know many of the teachers.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.400
A subject I studied in great detail was the human body.

00:37.970 --> 00:41.300
I wanted to know what caused life and what caused death.

00:41.740 --> 00:44.440
Then finally, I decided to use my knowledge.

00:45.080 --> 00:46.910
I set about creating a human being.

00:47.540 --> 00:51.610
It was one o'clock in the morning when I, at last, succeeded in creating life.

00:52.220 --> 00:56.480
As I looked at the lifeless human being, I saw one eye slowly open,...

00:56.990 --> 00:59.190
...then he began to breathe and move his arms.

00:59.650 --> 01:02.520
At first, I thought he would be a fine - looking man.

01:03.060 --> 01:05.760
I soon realized that there was nothing beautiful about him.

01:06.330 --> 01:09.830
I ran out of the room, disgusted by the creature I had created.
