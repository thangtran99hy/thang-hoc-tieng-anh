Hi, I'm Pegman.

00:01.850 --> 00:04.100
You might recognize me from Street View on Google Maps.

00:05.900 --> 00:09.550
With our new look, Street View's now become a more integrated part of Google Maps.

00:10.150 --> 00:11.350
Let me show you my new home.

00:12.900 --> 00:14.400
Let's explore San Francisco.

00:14.900 --> 00:18.000
Since you're in an area where Street View is available, I've lit up yellow.

00:18.700 --> 00:21.150
To enter Street View, grab me and drop me wherever you like.

00:21.700 --> 00:24.050
Street View is available on any street outlined in blue...

00:24.500 --> 00:27.600
...and thumbnail images appear as you hover over any point on the map.

00:29.250 --> 00:30.700
Hello, Painted Ladies.

00:31.050 --> 00:33.650
You're now exploring a neighborhood in our full screen mode.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.900
Zoom in by double - clicking on the map or by using the button.

00:38.600 --> 00:41.450
And take a 360 - degree tour with the new scroll wheel.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.950
To exit Street View, click on the X in the corner.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.050
You can now also enter Street View just by zooming in to the lowest level on the Google map.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.250
Take a walk down the street by using the white arrows...

00:53.350 --> 00:55.700
...or just pick me up to get where you wanna go faster.

00:58.200 --> 01:01.100
For travel directions, just enter your start and end locations.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.350
And by clicking on the camera icon,...

01:05.800 --> 01:08.100
...you can view Street View imagery of every step of your journey.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.000
Explore your route turn by turn.

01:15.600 --> 01:19.400
You can embed the image in a website or send it to a friend.

01:23.100 --> 01:24.350
Here we are. Sweet!

01:25.150 --> 01:28.300
If you ever find any Street View content that you feel is objectionable,...

01:28.750 --> 01:32.400
...click on "Report a concern" to report any inappropriate imagery.

01:33.250 --> 01:36.200
So whether it's for finding a location or virtual tourism,...

01:36.550 --> 01:39.850
...Street View lets you explore Google Maps like never before.
