What can shuck corn, light cigarettes, and change light bulbs?

00:11.570 --> 00:14.740
The answer, Chinese farmer Wu Yulu's robots.

00:21.220 --> 00:25.420
Wu's five 'sons', as they are known in the village on the outskirts of Beijing,...

00:25.650 --> 00:27.190
...each have a special skill.

00:27.690 --> 00:32.290
One can dance, one can jump, and another can run and chase away curious children.

00:39.870 --> 00:42.770
There's also a robot that can walk on walls and ceilings.

00:47.980 --> 00:52.580
But Wu's newest creation is the 'Darling' because it can do housework.

01:08.500 --> 01:13.440
The meter - high gadget is a concoction of gears and cables wrapped in a flowery green skirt.

01:31.090 --> 01:34.760
Guided by remote control, the robot can pick up things and carry them around,...

01:35.160 --> 01:40.200
...click on a lighter and screwing light bulbs and a myriad of menial household tasks.

01:49.440 --> 01:53.640
The creator of the robot is a 41 - year - old farmer who never finished primary school...

01:53.740 --> 01:56.980
...but has made more than 20 machines since 1995.

02:07.390 --> 02:12.990
Wu is regarded by his neighbors and their children as the man with many interesting toys in his house.

02:13.460 --> 02:18.700
But Wu has great faith in his creative aspirations and hopes his gadgets will benefit society.
