00:01.930 --> 00:04.070
I walked in the forest for about an hour.

00:04.630 --> 00:07.300
It was pleasantly cool in the shade of the trees.

00:07.640 --> 00:11.840
I sat down to rest by a large fallen tree, but I was so tired,...

00:12.170 --> 00:15.080
...and the forest was so quiet that I soon fell asleep.

00:15.680 --> 00:20.080
I dreamed that I was married to Princess Flavia and lived in the castle at Zenda.

00:20.480 --> 00:22.780
I had never seen the Princess in real life,...

00:23.120 --> 00:27.060
...but in my dream, I was about to kiss her when I heard a loud voice.

00:27.260 --> 00:30.030
"If you shaved his beard off, he would be the King!"

00:30.660 --> 00:34.930
I thought it was part of my dream, but then I realized that I was awake.

00:35.435 --> 00:38.830
I slowly opened my eyes to see two men looking at me.

00:39.370 --> 00:43.440
The younger man stepped forward. "This is Colonel Sapt," he said,...

00:43.640 --> 00:45.810
..."and I am Count Fritz von Tarlenheim."

00:46.340 --> 00:48.210
"We serve the King of Ruritania."

00:49.080 --> 00:51.510
As he spoke, a man came out of the trees.

00:51.850 --> 00:54.180
I was so surprised that I cried out.

00:54.580 --> 00:56.650
We were almost exactly the same.

00:57.250 --> 00:59.090
He could have been Rudolph Rassendyll...

00:59.390 --> 01:02.260
...and I could have been Rudolph, King of Ruritania!
