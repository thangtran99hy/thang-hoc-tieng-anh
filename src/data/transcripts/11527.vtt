One day, when Ali Baba was in the forest,...

00:05.950 --> 00:08.150
...he saw some robbers coming towards him.

00:08.750 --> 00:12.500
Ali Baba was afraid of them so he climbed a tree.

00:13.300 --> 00:15.350
The robbers rode up to the cave.

00:15.800 --> 00:20.600
When they got to it, one of them shouted, "Open sesame!".

00:21.350 --> 00:24.150
Immediately, a door opened in the cave.

00:25.050 --> 00:27.750
The robbers were inside for a long time.

00:28.700 --> 00:31.200
Then the door opened, and they came out.

00:32.150 --> 00:35.300
One of them shouted, "Close sesame!".

00:35.850 --> 00:39.200
And immediately, the door in the cave closed.

00:39.900 --> 00:41.200
The robbers went away.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.400
Ali Baba climbed down from the tree.

00:45.500 --> 00:46.800
He stood in front of the cave.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.900
"What is inside the cave?" he thought.

00:52.050 --> 00:55.000
"Open sesame!" he shouted to the cave.

00:55.650 --> 00:58.350
Immediately, a door opened into the cave.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.500
Ali Baba went inside.

01:00.900 --> 01:02.450
He was very surprised.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.700
The cave was full of bags of gold coins.
