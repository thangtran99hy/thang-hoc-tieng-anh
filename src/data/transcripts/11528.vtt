00:02.000 --> 00:04.400
There was once a boy whose name was Aladdin.

00:04.750 --> 00:10.300
One day, a few years after his father died, a man came to visit him and his mother.

00:11.050 --> 00:13.300
"I am the boy's uncle," the man said,...

00:13.850 --> 00:15.200
..."so I will help him."

00:16.150 --> 00:18.250
He took Aladdin to the beautiful garden.

00:18.950 --> 00:21.950
"I can make you rich," the man said to Aladdin,...

00:22.650 --> 00:24.700
..."but you must do as I say."

00:25.600 --> 00:28.800
In one part of the garden, there was a large stone.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.600
"Very well, Uncle," Aladdin said.

00:32.450 --> 00:36.000
He thought the man was his uncle, but the man was not.

00:36.550 --> 00:39.900
He was a wicked magician who needed Aladdin's help.

00:40.700 --> 00:43.400
"Cover yourself with your robe," he said,...

00:44.050 --> 00:45.450
..."then lift the stone."

00:46.050 --> 00:47.600
"There are steps under it."

00:48.050 --> 00:51.350
"At the bottom of the steps, you will see many rooms."

00:52.200 --> 00:54.450
"In one of the rooms, you will find a lamp,"...

00:55.150 --> 00:56.000
..."bring it to me."

00:56.850 --> 00:58.800
"Wear this ring," he said,...

00:59.250 --> 01:00.950
..."it will keep you from harm."

01:01.850 --> 01:05.100
Aladdin climbed down the steps and walked through the rooms.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.200
Soon, he found the lamp.

01:07.950 --> 01:09.700
The man was waiting for him.

01:10.550 --> 01:12.600
"Give me the lamp," he said.

01:13.250 --> 01:14.950
Aladdin argued with the man.

01:15.700 --> 01:20.050
"I will not give you the lamp until I am out of this hole," he said.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.750
The man became very angry.

01:23.600 --> 01:27.000
"Then, you will never get out of the hole," he said.

01:27.450 --> 01:31.300
He pushed the stone over the hole and returned to Africa.

01:32.100 --> 01:36.150
Aladdin tried to push the stone out of the way, but he could not.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.800
For three days, Aladdin was stuck in the hole.

01:40.300 --> 01:43.300
On the third day, he looked at the ring on his finger.

01:44.400 --> 01:48.050
"My uncle said, 'This will keep you from harm,'" he thought.

01:48.850 --> 01:50.450
He turned it on his finger.

01:51.050 --> 01:53.950
Immediately, a genie stood in front of him.
