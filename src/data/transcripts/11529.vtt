00:02.550 --> 00:05.450
A poor fisherman went down to the sea every day.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.100
One day, he threw his net into the sea four times.

00:09.600 --> 00:12.450
The fourth time, it had a large jar in it.

00:13.250 --> 00:16.700
"Perhaps there is something in the jar," the fisherman thought.

00:17.850 --> 00:20.750
He took off the lid and looked into the jar.
