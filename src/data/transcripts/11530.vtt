00:02.700 --> 00:05.400
There was once a merchant who had bad luck.

00:05.700 --> 00:08.450
He lost all his money and everything he owned.

00:09.250 --> 00:11.200
One day, he came to a big house.

00:11.800 --> 00:17.250
A servant walked up to the dogs and put down four bowls of food on the floor for them.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.800
The bowls were made of gold.

00:20.850 --> 00:22.200
He watched the dogs eat.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.200
One of them looked up at him.

00:25.050 --> 00:27.300
He pushed the bowl towards the poor merchant.

00:28.300 --> 00:31.000
"The dog wants me to eat," the merchant thought.

00:31.850 --> 00:35.800
When he finished eating, he thought, "I'll take this bowl and sell it."

00:36.450 --> 00:39.800
He sold the bowl made of gold and bought a shop.

00:40.300 --> 00:41.450
Many years passed.

00:41.900 --> 00:44.700
Although he was rich, the merchant was not happy.

00:45.600 --> 00:48.450
"I stole the bowl made of gold," he thought.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.700
"I shall not be happy until I repay the owner."

00:53.000 --> 00:56.700
He bought a valuable present and set out for the rich man's house.

00:57.250 --> 01:00.100
To his surprise, it was now in ruins.

01:00.750 --> 01:03.700
He went up to a beggar who was sitting in the ruins.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.500
"Tell me," he said,...

01:05.950 --> 01:07.000
..."what happened here?"

01:07.600 --> 01:10.200
"Where is the great man who used to live here?"

01:11.100 --> 01:13.550
"I am that man," he said.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.650
"This is very sad," the merchant said.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.050
"But now, your luck will change."

01:19.500 --> 01:22.200
"Many years ago, I was very poor."

01:23.050 --> 01:26.700
"One of your dogs pushed his bowl made of gold towards me."

01:27.550 --> 01:29.550
"I stole that bowl and sold it."

01:30.050 --> 01:31.900
"With the money, I bought a shop."

01:32.100 --> 01:35.200
"I filled it with goods and now, I am a rich man."

01:36.050 --> 01:37.500
The beggar waved him away.

01:38.250 --> 01:41.950
"I cannot take the money or the present," he said.

01:42.650 --> 01:45.050
"My dog wanted to give you that bowl."

01:45.400 --> 01:48.650
"I did nothing for you and the dog is long dead."

01:49.550 --> 01:50.800
"Go in peace, friend."

01:52.000 --> 01:53.600
The merchant thought for a while.

01:54.200 --> 01:59.550
Then, he said, "You may be a beggar, but you are truly a rich man."
