00:02.550 --> 00:06.050
Several years passed and then Sinbad went on another voyage.

00:06.600 --> 00:08.500
One day, they came near an island.

00:08.950 --> 00:13.550
It was a beautiful place and Sinbad walked about on it for many hours,...

00:14.600 --> 00:15.600
...then he was tired.

00:16.050 --> 00:18.000
He lay down and slept for a while.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.450
When he woke up, he was alone on the island.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.900
The ship and the small boat were nowhere to be seen.

00:25.950 --> 00:28.650
"They forgot about me," Sinbad thought.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.700
For many days, he walked about the island.

00:32.000 --> 00:32.900
He met no one.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.750
He was completely alone.

00:35.550 --> 00:39.150
Then one day, he saw a large dome on the ground.

00:39.950 --> 00:41.500
"What is it?" He thought.

00:41.950 --> 00:45.450
"It is smooth and there is no door or window in it."

00:46.350 --> 00:48.600
Then, he heard the sound of a great wind.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.900
Suddenly, the sky above him became dark.

00:52.800 --> 00:56.400
Sinbad was standing beneath the wing of a huge bird.

00:56.950 --> 00:58.500
The bird was a roc.

00:59.150 --> 01:00.600
The dome was the roc's egg.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.350
"The bird will soon fly away," Sinbad thought.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.900
"It can take me away from this island."

01:07.850 --> 01:11.850
He climbed onto one of the bird's legs and tied himself to it.
