Celebrated on February 14th,...

00:04.070 --> 00:09.370
...Valentine's Day is a holiday where lovers traditionally express their feelings for each other.

00:09.600 --> 00:14.110
Symbols of modern Valentine's Day include the heart shape and Cupid.

00:14.340 --> 00:18.410
The holiday is named for two martyred Christian saints named Valentine,...

00:18.850 --> 00:25.050
...but only became connected with romantic love in the middle ages with the help of poet Geoffrey Chaucer.

00:25.250 --> 00:33.030
Today, giving chocolate, jewelry or presenting one's love with flowers are all customary gifts for Valentine's Day.

00:33.230 --> 00:38.900
However, the most common present is the exchange of love notes known as Valentines.

00:39.050 --> 00:43.200
Over time, Valentine's Day has been reinvented over and over.

00:43.350 --> 00:47.880
It was roughly in the 1940s when the current card giving tradition began.

00:48.110 --> 00:51.850
Before that time, Valentines were mainly handwritten love notes,...

00:51.950 --> 00:54.850
...as opposed to the mass-produced greeting cards of today.

00:54.950 --> 00:57.250
In the second half of the 20th century,...

00:57.420 --> 01:00.800
...the gift giving trend extended to presents of all kind.

01:01.060 --> 01:07.500
And finally, in the 1980s, the diamond industry started promoting jewelry as an appropriate love token.

01:07.650 --> 01:14.200
Today, it is estimated that approximately one billion Valentine's Day cards are sent worldwide each year,...

01:14.300 --> 01:18.840
...making this day the second largest card sending holiday after Christmas.

01:19.010 --> 01:21.780
85% of those cards are sent by women.
