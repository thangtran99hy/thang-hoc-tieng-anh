This is Molly and Sam Gelman. How long have you been married?

00:05.030 --> 00:07.500
63 years.

00:07.770 --> 00:09.140
We met at a party...

00:10.070 --> 00:10.700
No.

00:10.850 --> 00:12.440
...downstairs in the basement.

00:13.210 --> 00:15.080
No. We went to lunch.

00:16.610 --> 00:23.920
It took me right before New Year's. And then, all of a sudden, the phone rang.

00:25.220 --> 00:26.790
I said, "Who is it?"

00:27.090 --> 00:32.390
"It's Sam Gelman." At New Year's day, he wanted a date.

00:32.590 --> 00:40.170
I said, "No, I'm tired. I'm going to rest and I'll see you another time."

00:40.440 --> 00:42.100
He really looked terrible.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.640
So, was it love at first sight?

00:43.800 --> 00:45.170
Not at all.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.210
But I figured I'd give him another chance.

00:49.310 --> 00:49.780
Right.

00:50.420 --> 00:50.810
Go.

00:52.250 --> 00:54.450
We met on a corner of...

00:56.210 --> 00:56.790
What street?

00:57.220 --> 00:58.320
Church Avenue.

00:59.290 --> 01:01.160
Church at Flatbush Avenue.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.060
I know it well.

01:02.160 --> 01:04.560
And there's a restaurant right on the corner.

01:05.260 --> 01:07.100
On the corner of that restaurant.

01:08.100 --> 01:09.300
How beautiful was she?

01:09.630 --> 01:12.270
She was gorgeous.

01:12.870 --> 01:13.800
She was gorgeous.

01:13.900 --> 01:14.400
I was.

01:14.570 --> 01:16.170
And we went into the restaurant.

01:17.910 --> 01:22.410
And, what do you know, we went into the restaurant right on the corner.

01:22.810 --> 01:24.850
I can't think of the name of the restaurant.

01:25.650 --> 01:26.650
But it was a...

01:27.620 --> 01:28.250
Dairy.

01:28.350 --> 01:30.650
It was actually a cafeteria.

01:32.350 --> 01:33.390
Thank you so much!
