If, as I, you are afraid of spiders, you have three solutions.

00:04.450 --> 00:05.550
One, run!

00:10.950 --> 00:12.700
Two, kill the beast.

00:16.700 --> 00:18.600
Three, master your fear.

00:22.200 --> 00:25.300
First thing you must not forget, who's the boss?

00:25.800 --> 00:28.850
You, big, strong, and armed.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.700
The spider, little,...

00:31.350 --> 00:34.100
...yes little, helpless and scared to death.

00:34.850 --> 00:38.600
Second thing, don't let your emotions overwhelm you.

00:41.100 --> 00:41.400
Jerk.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.550
Third advice, be friendly.

00:45.100 --> 00:46.050
Offer her a gift.

00:48.000 --> 00:48.300
What the?

00:49.250 --> 00:51.050
Something suitable for spiders.

00:55.300 --> 00:56.900
Apply the Batman technique.

00:57.150 --> 01:00.100
To master your fear, you must become your fear.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.950
Five, sing her a song.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.650
Six, hold it in your hand.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.700
I said hold it in your hand!

01:25.500 --> 01:30.900
Seven, and last but not least, if the spider disappears, don't panic!

01:36.900 --> 01:40.700
If you know any other tips, please leave a comment or a video response,...

01:40.900 --> 01:45.100
...and tell me what is your phobia so I can make another seven tips video out of it.
