Walking into a job interview wearing the wrong attire...

00:11.371 --> 00:14.974
...is like showing up at a black-tie event dressed up for a costume party.

00:15.463 --> 00:17.457
A bad move you'll instantly regret.

00:20.489 --> 00:23.473
You will need: tidy, neatly styled hair,...

00:23.873 --> 00:26.299
...a clean face, hands, and fingernails,...

00:26.627 --> 00:28.198
...a clean, professional outfit,...

00:29.066 --> 00:30.967
...a briefcase or a portfolio,...

00:31.353 --> 00:33.965
...and a pair of comfortable closed-toe shoes.

00:35.812 --> 00:38.239
Optional: small, tasteful jewelry,...

00:38.690 --> 00:41.070
...a light and subtle perfume, or aftershave,...

00:42.349 --> 00:46.076
...a manicure, natural-looking makeup and a new haircut.

00:47.485 --> 00:49.974
Step 1: Before the big event,...

00:50.151 --> 00:53.135
...find out how the employees dress where you'll be interviewing.

00:53.389 --> 00:56.743
Ask whoever's arranging the interview for you what the dress code is...

00:56.942 --> 00:59.207
...and if they have any pointers on what to wear.

01:00.554 --> 01:05.581
Step 2: Find something in your wardrobe that's in line with what other employees wear,...

01:05.930 --> 01:10.401
...but kick it up a notch: a sharp tie, a colorful scarf, or a pocket square.

01:10.749 --> 01:12.495
Something to separate you from the pack.

01:13.501 --> 01:15.741
Step 3: But don't go overboard.

01:16.093 --> 01:19.170
You want to make a good impression, not a fashion statement.

01:22.102 --> 01:27.222
Step 4: Go easy on the aftershave and perfume, as well as the makeup and jewelry.

01:27.670 --> 01:28.919
Keep things tasteful.

01:30.346 --> 01:32.339
Step 5: Be neat.

01:32.573 --> 01:36.672
Make sure your clothes are clean and pressed, and your hair, and teeth are brushed.

01:37.740 --> 01:41.900
Step 6: Make sure you'll be comfortable sitting, standing, and walking.

01:42.180 --> 01:44.983
Now is not the time to break in a new pair of shoes.

01:46.799 --> 01:50.805
Step 7: Get prepared early, show up on time,...

01:51.499 --> 01:55.442
...and most importantly, make sure you end up in the right place.

01:59.193 --> 01:59.856
Did you know?

02:00.078 --> 02:04.115
Research shows that 55% of a person's overall impression of you...

02:04.223 --> 02:05.597
...is based on how you look?
