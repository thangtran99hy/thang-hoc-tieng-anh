While bikinis seem like a no-brainer for a swimsuit issue,...

00:07.900 --> 00:11.200
...other strings are also garnering great attention.

00:11.550 --> 00:15.550
Silk - wrapped bracelets called Bhati beads by Margaret Maggard.

00:16.050 --> 00:19.500
Well as my husband said, "There's jewelry in Sports Illustrated Swimsuit?"

00:20.100 --> 00:26.900
These pieces, what I think the reason why they do well is because you can wear them when you're 55 years old...

00:27.000 --> 00:28.350
...and you don't have to get into a bikini.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.500
And, you know, you may not look like one of these girls in the magazine,...

00:31.550 --> 00:32.850
...but you can have a little piece of that.

00:33.650 --> 00:39.300
A yoga instructor, Maggard was crafting jewelry for friends in the basement of her Milwaukee home.

00:39.750 --> 00:42.650
When she started to look towards selling outside her circle,...

00:42.950 --> 00:45.800
...she ran across the 2006 swimsuit issue...

00:46.200 --> 00:48.050
...and it proved inspirational.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.600
And I saw the jewelry they were wearing...

00:50.750 --> 00:53.950
...and I noticed who was making the jewelry, and I thought, "I wanna be with those guys."

00:54.250 --> 00:58.300
As a little manufacturer, do you think that would help you or hurt you going in?

00:58.450 --> 00:59.250
I thought it would hurt me.

00:59.650 --> 01:01.850
I thought they want the big names.

01:02.700 --> 01:04.800
But I thought, "It's so perfect."

01:05.050 --> 01:09.200
So, Maggard made 12 bracelets and sent them to MJ Day.

01:09.650 --> 01:11.750
The simple styling was a hit.

01:12.300 --> 01:15.000
It's just something that really grabbed our attention...

01:15.200 --> 01:18.750
...and worked really well with where we are now, with how we style.

01:18.850 --> 01:22.600
Like, what the girls would be wearing if they were to just throw on their own jewelry.
