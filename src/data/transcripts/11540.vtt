00:07.640 --> 00:12.770
Urban Russians flush with cash but short on space are buying into one American dream,...

00:13.010 --> 00:13.980
...in miniature.

00:14.540 --> 00:16.410
What do you get a Russian who has everything?

00:16.640 --> 00:19.550
A miniature horse to put in a miniature stable...

00:19.750 --> 00:21.980
...in their country home outside of Moscow.

00:22.550 --> 00:24.720
You can't ride them and you can't race them,...

00:24.890 --> 00:28.860
...but these mini horses are equine in all things except for size.

00:29.190 --> 00:30.730
Bred to be tiny and good - natured.

00:35.260 --> 00:37.200
...of small scale horse breeding.

00:44.970 --> 00:49.850
A new venture located outside Moscow has just began importing these diminutive horses...
