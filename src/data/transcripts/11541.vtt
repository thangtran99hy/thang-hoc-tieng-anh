They fought the French, the Chinese, and the Americans,...

00:07.875 --> 00:11.073
...but this determined South Asian country is, at last, independent.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.533
The Vietnamese are resilient people.

00:13.775 --> 00:14.882
In spite of their suffering,...

00:14.954 --> 00:18.321
...they're also very friendly and warm and full of national pride.

00:18.863 --> 00:22.631
In Vietnam, the old and the new live comfortably side by side.

00:23.747 --> 00:27.411
Hanoi is elegantly French with beautiful tree-lined boulevards...

00:27.471 --> 00:28.799
...and classic architecture.

00:29.687 --> 00:31.293
The old quarters beckon.

00:31.637 --> 00:33.240
The antiquated mazes of streets...

00:33.357 --> 00:36.765
...filled with shops, outdoor restaurants and cafes captivate.

00:37.682 --> 00:41.546
Ho Chi Minh city is vibrant and modern, bustling with street life.

00:42.431 --> 00:46.926
Authentic markets, chic bars and stylish young women are visual delights.

00:49.146 --> 00:52.055
Crossing the streets in Ho Chi Minh city is an adventure.

00:52.915 --> 00:56.519
The traffic literally never stops, but don't panic.

00:56.871 --> 01:00.861
Cross slowly, steadily and somehow the traffic goes around you.

01:01.285 --> 01:06.305
Vietnam at peace, but still quite undiscovered by the West, is very welcoming.
