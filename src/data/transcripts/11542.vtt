You mentioned last night when we were having dinner that when you first got the job as CEO,...

00:04.250 --> 00:07.300
...you got a call from Steve Jobs and he offered you some advice?

00:08.100 --> 00:10.500
Well, he didn't call to offer me advice,...

00:10.550 --> 00:16.250
...but we have worked together on a Nike - Apple collaboration called Nike Plus.

00:16.350 --> 00:20.800
So, we took what Apple knows, what Nike knows and, you know, brought a new technology to the market.

00:21.800 --> 00:25.550
Anyway, long story short, he said, "Hey, congratulations."

00:25.600 --> 00:26.000
"It's great."

00:26.150 --> 00:27.150
"You're gonna do a great job."

00:28.150 --> 00:29.400
I said, "Well, do you have any advice?"

00:29.550 --> 00:32.250
And he said, "No, no. You're great."

00:32.850 --> 00:33.700
And then there was a pause...

00:33.750 --> 00:35.500
...and he goes, "Well, I do have some advice."

00:36.050 --> 00:38.550
He goes, "Nike makes some of the best product in the world."

00:38.800 --> 00:42.600
"I mean, product that you lust after, absolutely beautiful, stunning product."

00:43.250 --> 00:44.700
"But you also make a lot of crap."

00:45.400 --> 00:49.050
He said, "Just get rid of the crappy stuff and focus on the good stuff."

00:50.450 --> 00:52.550
And then I expected a little pause and a laugh,...

00:52.750 --> 00:54.950
...but there was a pause but no laugh at the end.

00:56.100 --> 00:56.400
Yeah.

00:57.300 --> 00:58.600
And he was absolutely right.

00:58.800 --> 01:06.100
And in fact, that's one of my major focal points in terms of my priorities as a CEO...

01:06.350 --> 01:09.850
...and even as a designer when I was growing up at the company, is to edit.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.450
We have so many ideas.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.050
Nike is an idea factory.
