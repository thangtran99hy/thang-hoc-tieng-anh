00:05.550 --> 00:09.250
Just because you're short on cash, doesn't mean you can't see the world.

00:09.950 --> 00:13.050
You will need: Patience to sniff out the best deals,...

00:13.550 --> 00:14.650
...willingness to rough it,...

00:15.200 --> 00:17.050
...and the ability to be flexible.

00:17.750 --> 00:20.100
Optional: A budget travel guidebook.

00:20.750 --> 00:24.700
Step 1: Use travel consolidators on and offline.

00:25.100 --> 00:28.567
They snatch up empty airline seats and unsold cruise cabins...

00:28.673 --> 00:30.481
...and resell them at a great discount.

00:30.650 --> 00:33.650
Sign up to receive information on last-minute deals.

00:34.650 --> 00:38.050
Call hotels directly to see if you can negotiate a cheaper rate.

00:38.833 --> 00:41.341
Step 2: Consider youth hostels,...

00:41.660 --> 00:44.347
...especially in the more expensive cities around the world.

00:44.700 --> 00:47.450
You'll sacrifice privacy, but you'll save a bundle.

00:50.500 --> 00:54.500
If you live in a popular travel destination, consider swapping homes with someone.

00:55.200 --> 00:59.150
Step 3: Rely on street food vendors for most of your meals.

01:00.100 --> 01:04.200
If you like to eat out, make lunch your daily restaurant treat instead of dinner.

01:04.950 --> 01:08.800
Step 4: Check out student rates on bus and rail passes.

01:09.700 --> 01:12.250
Be a "voluntourist" in a country you'd like to visit.

01:12.650 --> 01:16.000
You'll get to explore a new culture while helping out the locals...

01:16.350 --> 01:19.550
...and maybe even wrangle some school credit for the experience.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.600
Step 5: Be flexible.

01:22.950 --> 01:26.550
Monday and Thursday departures are generally cheaper than weekend fares,...

01:26.800 --> 01:29.700
...and save a bundle by flying into a less popular city,...

01:29.900 --> 01:33.300
...and then catching a train or driving to your desired destination.

01:33.933 --> 01:36.793
Step 6: Vacation in the off-season,...

01:36.879 --> 01:40.157
...when prices are cheaper and you don't have to fight the crowds.

01:40.891 --> 01:43.188
Did you know? According to one survey,...

01:43.491 --> 01:48.085
...French air travelers rate safety as less important than getting a cheap seat.
