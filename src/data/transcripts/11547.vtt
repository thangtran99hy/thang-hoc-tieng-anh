Romeo heard his friends calling for him, but he did not respond.

00:07.340 --> 00:10.210
It was cold and dark under the trees in the Capulet's garden.

00:10.610 --> 00:12.610
He only cared about his new love, Juliet.

00:13.240 --> 00:15.480
He sat and shivered and looked at the house,...

00:15.680 --> 00:19.010
...dreaming about Juliet's beauty, and remembering her kiss.

00:19.480 --> 00:24.190
He saw a light in one of the rooms, and then he saw a girl come out onto the balcony.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.720
It was Juliet and he could see her!

00:27.420 --> 00:32.000
"Oh, Romeo, Romeo! Why do you have to be Romeo?"

00:32.860 --> 00:38.070
"Why are you a Montague? Forget about your father and change your name."

00:38.605 --> 00:42.770
"If you cannot, I will forget about my father and change my name."

00:43.170 --> 00:45.310
"I will no longer be a Capulet."

00:46.310 --> 00:49.710
This was too much for Romeo. He could no longer stay quiet.

00:50.380 --> 00:52.930
"If you say you love me, I will change my name."

00:53.720 --> 00:55.950
"From now on, I will never be Romeo!"

00:56.280 --> 01:00.390
"Love made it easy to climb the wall because walls cannot stop love."

01:00.820 --> 01:05.460
"Nor is love afraid of danger. If your family hates me, let them kill me."

01:06.060 --> 01:10.100
"It is better to die by their hate than to live without your love."

01:10.630 --> 01:11.600
"I love you!"

01:12.130 --> 01:17.140
Juliet was glad that it was dark because she blushed and did not want Romeo to see it.
