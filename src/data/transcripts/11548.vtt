Mark Twain declared Hawaii to be the loveliest fleet of islands...

00:05.951 --> 00:07.714
...that lies anchored in any ocean...

00:08.057 --> 00:11.421
...and not even years of mass tourism have managed to prove him wrong.

00:14.457 --> 00:19.542
Its very name conjures up dreamy images of drinking mai tais to slack-key guitar,...

00:19.865 --> 00:24.118
...attracting millions of visitors a year to these picture-perfect tropical islands.

00:26.796 --> 00:31.576
Holiday makers crowd onto the sand here to enjoy some kitsch tourist action.

00:39.452 --> 00:42.221
Don't miss a chance to catch an outrigger canoe race.

00:42.986 --> 00:45.691
The Koa canoes have been part of the Pacific island life...

00:45.765 --> 00:47.857
...and culture for 4,000 years.

00:48.234 --> 00:50.303
Visitors can even try it out themselves.

00:51.626 --> 00:53.033
Surfers love Hawaii.

00:53.402 --> 00:56.126
Best breaks are along Oahu's north shore...

00:56.353 --> 00:59.201
...especially at the Banzai Pipeline and Tunnels Beach.

01:00.255 --> 01:04.045
Behind the natural beauty here, there's a simmering independence movement...

01:04.209 --> 01:06.728
...working to break Hawaii from the United States.

01:07.559 --> 01:10.605
The island's politics could be as rocky and as treacherous...

01:10.870 --> 01:13.482
...as the Hawaii Volcano National Park.

01:14.545 --> 01:19.325
The park itself is a striking combination of desolation and sulfuric lava.

01:19.687 --> 01:22.733
It's best viewed from the safe distance of a helicopter.

01:31.257 --> 01:34.186
"Aloha!" when you arrive, "Aloha!" when you leave.

01:34.305 --> 01:35.513
It's all too easy.
