Hi, honey.

00:01.900 --> 00:03.150
Hi darling, how's work?

00:03.400 --> 00:04.100
Not great.

00:04.250 --> 00:05.250
Really busy actually.

00:05.650 --> 00:07.200
And we still have to start with the financials.

00:07.400 --> 00:08.550
Poor, poor baby.

00:08.750 --> 00:10.550
So I think we're digging in for a late one tonight.

00:10.850 --> 00:12.150
Do you want me to leave you dinner in the oven?

00:12.300 --> 00:14.600
No, I think Tim is gonna order in a stack of pizzas.

00:15.150 --> 00:15.700
I better go.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.700
Sooner I start, sooner I finish, eh?

00:18.100 --> 00:19.000
Alright, darling.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.100
Good luck, I love you.

00:21.650 --> 00:22.500
I love you too, May.

00:23.050 --> 00:23.686
See you later.

00:24.000 --> 00:24.250
Bye.

00:29.150 --> 00:29.600
You're up.

00:29.800 --> 00:30.550
Cheers, mate.

00:30.650 --> 00:31.400
Your round next?

00:31.800 --> 00:32.766
See you out there.
