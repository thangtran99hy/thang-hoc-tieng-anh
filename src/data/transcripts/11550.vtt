Well in the film, when asked by Spock, "Why are you climbing the mountain?"

00:07.200 --> 00:11.100
Kirk says, somewhat facetiously, "Because it's there.",...

00:11.850 --> 00:13.800
...a remark attributed to the climber Mallory.

00:15.100 --> 00:17.100
Mountain is climbed, yes, because it's there,...

00:17.200 --> 00:18.850
...because otherwise, you'll be walking on the plains.

00:20.200 --> 00:26.150
But the mountain is climbed because I think the climber wants to hug the mountain.

00:27.250 --> 00:30.800
He wants to envelop that mountain within his body.

00:31.150 --> 00:32.600
He wants to make love to the mountain.

00:34.150 --> 00:36.800
And on its highest and finest level,...

00:37.150 --> 00:45.950
...whether these tough young guys with their sinewy bodies and their one-meal-a-day routine...

00:46.200 --> 00:52.450
...will admit it, there is a passionate affair going on between the climber and the mountain.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.700
Why do I climb the mountain?

00:55.100 --> 00:58.200
I would say the climber would say, "Because I'm in love."
