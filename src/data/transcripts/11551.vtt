00:01.709 --> 00:04.096
The Dashwoods were now quite comfortable at Barton,...

00:04.509 --> 00:06.823
...and the house and garden were now familiar to them.

00:07.129 --> 00:11.917
After two days of rain, Marianne and Margaret set off to enjoy one of these together.

00:12.348 --> 00:16.339
They happily ran down the hills, searching for every piece of blue sky.

00:16.889 --> 00:20.510
Then all of a sudden, the clouds came together over their heads,...

00:20.856 --> 00:22.723
...and a hard rain fell on their faces.

00:23.144 --> 00:27.863
Surprised, they had to turn back and began to run at full speed back to the house.

00:28.326 --> 00:33.685
At first, Marianne was ahead, but she slipped in the wet and was suddenly on the ground.

00:34.303 --> 00:39.013
A young gentleman carrying a gun with two dogs playing around him saw Marianne fall.

00:39.689 --> 00:42.019
He put down his gun and ran to her assistance.

00:42.691 --> 00:45.110
She had twisted her ankle and could barely stand.

00:45.643 --> 00:48.350
He took her up in his arms and carried her down the hill.

00:49.099 --> 00:52.596
He walked through the garden, and into the house, and seated her on a chair.

00:53.255 --> 00:56.293
Elinor and her mother stood up in amazement at their entrance.

00:56.949 --> 00:59.045
The man apologized for the interruption...

00:59.469 --> 01:02.875
...in a manner that made him appear even more handsome than he already was.

01:03.451 --> 01:04.375
But who is he?
