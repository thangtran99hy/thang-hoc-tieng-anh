00:02.700 --> 00:04.000
Once upon a time,...

00:04.270 --> 00:06.840
...there was a wolf that put on a sheep's skin...

00:07.000 --> 00:09.640
...to make the sheep on a farm think he was one of them.

00:10.470 --> 00:12.110
Then they would let him get near them,...

00:12.470 --> 00:14.610
...and he would be able to kill and eat one of them.

00:15.640 --> 00:18.450
When night came, the farmer shut up all his sheep...

00:18.710 --> 00:22.880
...including the wolf in sheep's clothing, to keep them safe during the night.

00:23.520 --> 00:24.390
The next morning,...

00:24.820 --> 00:28.090
...he went to pick a sheep to kill so his family would have meat to eat.

00:29.020 --> 00:31.590
He looked for what he thought was the largest sheep and killed it.

00:32.430 --> 00:33.260
It was the wolf.
