Hello! Welcome to Michael's Better Business English!

00:04.150 --> 00:07.350
This month, we're looking at how to speak logically.

00:08.150 --> 00:11.400
This is a very important skill in business communication...

00:11.900 --> 00:15.400
...and one many Japanese business people find difficult.

00:16.800 --> 00:21.500
The reason is often when Japanese business people are explaining their ideas,...

00:21.850 --> 00:24.000
...they lack a logical structure.

00:25.450 --> 00:28.000
This structure gives some organization...

00:28.600 --> 00:33.900
...to make the ideas logical, easy to understand, and sound effective.

00:34.800 --> 00:39.050
Now, there are many possible structures you could use to explain your ideas logically.

00:39.900 --> 00:44.350
One that I'd recommend especially if you're, say, describing a project,...

00:44.650 --> 00:49.500
...explaining something, or recommending a strategy is the SOAR statement.

00:50.650 --> 00:53.800
This is a very simple but effective logical structure.

00:54.700 --> 01:00.300
SOAR stands for situation, objective, actions, and result.

01:01.400 --> 01:04.500
Situation, any useful background information.

01:05.250 --> 01:09.100
Objective, the goal, the target of what you're talking about.

01:10.500 --> 01:16.500
Actions, this could be an action plan or the actions you are taking to achieve your target.

01:17.250 --> 01:18.700
And then finally, result.

01:19.100 --> 01:23.900
What you expect to get at the end of this project or strategy, or whatever.

01:25.100 --> 01:30.600
So, I normally recommend to my students, remember SOAR in business meetings or discussions,...

01:30.850 --> 01:34.750
...or when somebody asks you to describe or explain something clearly.

01:35.050 --> 01:37.800
This is an easy technique to help you speak logically.

01:38.850 --> 01:40.300
Thank you and good luck!
