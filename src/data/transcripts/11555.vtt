00:03.550 --> 00:07.750
A salt merchant took his ass to the seaside where he bought sacks of salt.

00:08.550 --> 00:12.000
He loaded the sacks of salt on the ass and set off for home.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.050
On the way home, they had to cross a river.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.300
The ass slipped and fell into the river.

00:19.250 --> 00:20.800
When the ass got to his feet,...

00:21.450 --> 00:25.750
...he found his load was not so heavy because most of the salt had melted in the water.

00:26.650 --> 00:29.950
The merchant now had to go back to the seaside and buy more salt.

00:30.700 --> 00:32.950
This time, he bought more than before.

00:33.900 --> 00:36.600
Once again, they came to the river on their way home.

00:37.650 --> 00:40.900
This time, the ass made himself fall into the water...

00:41.350 --> 00:43.900
...so that it would melt the salt in the sacks on his back.

00:45.150 --> 00:46.950
The merchant saw what the ass had done...

00:47.300 --> 00:49.700
...and was very angry with it for trying to cheat him.

00:50.800 --> 00:55.100
He took it back to the seaside and filled the sacks with sponges instead of salt.

00:56.150 --> 00:58.250
When they reached the river on their way home,...

00:58.600 --> 01:00.850
...the ass again made himself fall into the water.

01:01.850 --> 01:04.900
This time, however, the sponges became full of water...

01:05.400 --> 01:07.300
...and the sacks were now heavier than before.
