Now, I've never interrupted a wedding per se.

00:13.516 --> 00:16.695
But if I was going to, this is how I would do it.

00:17.882 --> 00:19.081
This is called "Speak Now".

00:41.133 --> 00:46.572
I think in writing this album by myself, there was absolutely nothing holding me back.

00:48.469 --> 00:52.719
Just the idea of, "if I'm going to write this album by myself" say it all.

00:54.869 --> 00:59.383
I think that, you know, co-writers are such a huge, amazing part of the music industry...

00:59.473 --> 01:03.764
...and I've loved working with them. And I've written songs, all kinds in different ways, but...

01:04.133 --> 01:06.205
...with this album, writing it by myself,...

01:07.819 --> 01:10.927
...I think I was more inclined to say the things...

01:11.040 --> 01:14.537
...that I may not have been courageous enough to bring up in a co-writing session.

01:41.558 --> 01:46.489
I wrote probably in total, about 40 to 50 songs for this record and...

01:47.307 --> 01:48.334
...chose between them,...

01:49.217 --> 01:52.300
...kind of very ruthlessly just said, "May the best song win"...

01:53.733 --> 01:57.545
..."and may this song that says it in its truest form win."

01:57.861 --> 02:00.365
When you've already done this kind of song before and,...

02:00.464 --> 02:01.805
...you know, you don't wanna repeat yourself,...

02:02.067 --> 02:03.995
...you wanna take musical risks,...

02:04.169 --> 02:05.745
...but you never wanna alienate people.

02:06.086 --> 02:08.175
There are a lot of fine lines that you have to balance.

02:08.812 --> 02:12.025
All the while, never saying the same but never changing.

02:12.797 --> 02:15.697
It's this whole, complicated thing. I feel like this album feels right.

02:16.174 --> 02:20.683
And finally arriving on that, after two years of working for it, is really cool.
