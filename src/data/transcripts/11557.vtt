Now Bruce, just look right into the camera lens right here...

00:03.000 --> 00:05.290
...and tell us your name, your age, and where you were born.

00:06.740 --> 00:13.010
My last name is Lee, Bruce Lee. I was born in San Francisco in 1940. I'm 24 right now.

00:13.310 --> 00:16.280
And you worked in motion pictures in Hong Kong?

00:16.950 --> 00:19.250
Yes, since I was around six years old.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.120
And when did you leave Hong Kong?

00:21.780 --> 00:23.890
1959, when I was 18.

00:24.220 --> 00:25.920
And you went to college in the United States?

00:26.100 --> 00:26.490
Yes.

00:26.960 --> 00:27.720
And what did you study?

00:28.760 --> 00:29.430
Philosophy.

00:29.620 --> 00:33.560
Would you look right into the camera lens and explain the principle of the glass of water...

00:33.800 --> 00:35.330
...as it applies to kung fu.

00:36.560 --> 00:39.800
Well, kung fu, the best example would be a glass of water.

00:40.500 --> 00:44.010
Why? Because water is the softest substance in the world,...

00:44.770 --> 00:50.210
...but yet it can penetrate the hardest rock or anything, granite, you name it.

00:51.480 --> 00:53.450
So, every kung fu man is trying to do that,...

00:53.680 --> 00:58.120
...to be soft like water, and flexible and adapt itself to the opponent.

00:59.120 --> 01:02.560
I see. What's the difference between a kung fu punch and a karate punch?

01:03.190 --> 01:06.490
Well, the karate punch is like an iron bar, whang!

01:07.760 --> 01:13.670
A kung fu punch is like an iron chain with an iron ball attached to the end, and it go whang!

01:13.840 --> 01:14.910
And it hurts inside.

01:15.140 --> 01:17.310
Show me once again, just a few movements there.

01:17.940 --> 01:21.110
Well, kung fu can be practiced alone or with a partner.

01:21.750 --> 01:28.720
Practicing alone may involve forms. Some imitate a crane, a monkey, a praying mantis.

01:30.020 --> 01:31.350
This is a crane form.

01:32.540 --> 01:33.220
Start off.

01:43.030 --> 01:45.070
This is one of the movements involved.

01:45.330 --> 01:47.870
Show us one more movement and then we'll be all through.

01:48.070 --> 01:49.800
Okay, I'm glad to hear that.

01:52.540 --> 01:54.040
They have the tiger...

01:55.310 --> 01:56.540
...that starts like a tiger,...

01:57.410 --> 02:00.750
...using claw to claw the face or the beak of the crane to the eyes.

02:06.190 --> 02:07.360
These are some of the movements involved.

02:07.590 --> 02:08.460
Thank you very much.
