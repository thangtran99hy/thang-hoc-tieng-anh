00:03.060 --> 00:06.770
A shepherd - boy looked after the sheep belonging to the people of the village.

00:07.440 --> 00:10.310
One day, he cried, "Wolf! Wolf!"

00:11.240 --> 00:14.640
Hearing him, the villagers ran to help him drive away the wolf.

00:15.380 --> 00:18.980
However, when they reached him, there was no wolf to be seen.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.620
The boy thought it was very funny.

00:22.750 --> 00:25.120
"You weren't quick enough," he said to them.

00:25.550 --> 00:26.720
"The wolf has run away."

00:28.190 --> 00:33.630
Thinking he was very clever, a few days later, he shouted, "Wolf!" again.

00:34.560 --> 00:37.930
Again, the villagers came to help him, and again he said,...

00:38.500 --> 00:41.440
..."You weren't quick enough. The wolf has run away."

00:42.340 --> 00:45.370
The angry villagers went back to their work in the village.

00:46.040 --> 00:50.350
A week later, the boy shouted, "Wolf!" again,...

00:51.050 --> 00:52.750
...but the villagers did not believe him.

00:53.680 --> 00:56.520
However, this time, there really was a wolf...

00:56.950 --> 01:00.490
...and it killed all the sheep, because no one came to drive it away.
