My name is Allan Quatermain.

00:05.600 --> 00:11.050
It has been about eighteen months since I first met Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good.

00:11.700 --> 00:17.100
I was on board the Dunkeld on my way home to Natal after a month of elephant hunting.

00:17.767 --> 00:18.850
At the end of dinner,...

00:19.131 --> 00:22.982
...Sir Henry asked me to go to his cabin and have a whisky with him.

00:23.600 --> 00:26.050
As soon as my glass was full, he said,...

00:26.233 --> 00:30.063
..."Mr. Quatermain, I believe that at about this time last year,...

00:30.435 --> 00:32.627
...you were at a place called Bamangwato."

00:33.150 --> 00:35.100
"That is so," I said.

00:35.550 --> 00:39.300
"Did you meet a man called Neville?" He asked me next.

00:39.500 --> 00:40.500
"George Neville."

00:41.150 --> 00:43.000
"I did," I replied.

00:43.750 --> 00:46.250
Sir Henry drank a little of his whisky,...

00:46.500 --> 00:49.800
...then said, "Mr. George Neville is my brother."

00:50.700 --> 00:53.100
For a few moments, Sir Henry was silent,...

00:53.400 --> 00:54.643
...then he said,...

00:54.977 --> 01:00.029
"Mr. Quatermain, will you please tell me everything you know about my brother, Neville?"

01:00.650 --> 01:03.350
I drank a little of my whisky and then said,...

01:04.050 --> 01:07.500
..."Your brother wanted to find King Solomon's Mines."

01:08.000 --> 01:10.350
"That is why he set out for Inyati."

01:11.400 --> 01:15.400
"I spoke to his servant, a Bechuana we called Jim."

01:16.050 --> 01:19.100
"Where are you and your master going?" I asked him.

01:19.850 --> 01:22.050
"To Suliman country," he replied,...

01:22.250 --> 01:23.450
..."to find the diamonds."

01:24.100 --> 01:26.050
"You'll die," I told him.

01:26.700 --> 01:29.350
"No one has ever come back from there alive."

01:30.000 --> 01:32.650
"I can't stop him from going," Jim said.

01:33.400 --> 01:38.500
Sir Henry said, "Mr. Quatermain, I am going to look for my brother."

01:38.900 --> 01:39.850
"Will you help me?"

01:40.400 --> 01:45.400
"I will pay you whatever you ask if you will come with me," Sir Henry said.

01:45.550 --> 01:46.750
"I am a rich man."

01:47.100 --> 01:48.950
"I can make you one, too."
