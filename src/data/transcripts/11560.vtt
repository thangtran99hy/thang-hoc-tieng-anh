00:02.850 --> 00:07.800
One day, a farmer said to his wife, "We don't often use our horse."

00:08.050 --> 00:09.050
"Shall we sell it?"

00:09.750 --> 00:11.500
"Then, sell it," his wife said.

00:11.800 --> 00:13.300
"You are always right."

00:14.100 --> 00:16.100
The farmer set off for the market.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
A friend of the farmer came up to him.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.400
"Are you crazy?" He asked.

00:21.950 --> 00:25.200
"What will your wife say when she sees the rotten apples?"

00:26.150 --> 00:30.150
"She'll kiss me and tell me how clever I am," the farmer said.

00:30.850 --> 00:34.450
"I'll bet you a bar of gold that she doesn't," the friend said.

00:35.325 --> 00:41.100
"I'll bet you everything I have that my wife will think I am clever," the farmer said.

00:41.850 --> 00:44.500
He went back to his farm and his friend came, too.

00:45.250 --> 00:47.400
His wife was waiting at the door for him.

00:47.900 --> 00:50.050
"Hello, my dear," the farmer said.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.000
"I gave a man our horse for his cow."

00:53.850 --> 00:56.875
"That was very clever of you," the wife said.

00:57.400 --> 01:01.000
"Then, I gave another man the cow for his sheep," the farmer said.

01:02.100 --> 01:05.400
"Oh, that was a very good thing to do," his wife said.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.700
"What a clever man you are!"

01:08.450 --> 01:11.350
"Then, I gave another man the sheep for his goose."

01:12.150 --> 01:15.500
"Oh, I love eating goose eggs," his wife said.

01:16.150 --> 01:19.750
"But I then gave a man the goose for his hen," the farmer said.

01:20.700 --> 01:24.750
"A hen's eggs are much better than a goose's eggs," his wife said.

01:25.650 --> 01:30.700
"But then, I gave a man the hen for a sack of rotten apples," the farmer said.

01:31.850 --> 01:34.600
"Oh, I am so glad," his wife said.

01:35.150 --> 01:38.050
"I went to our neighbor to borrow some herbs."

01:38.400 --> 01:41.500
"'I have nothing to give you for them,' I said to her."

01:42.000 --> 01:44.900
"'I don't even have any rotten apples.'"

01:45.700 --> 01:49.000
The farmer's wife put her arms around her husband and kissed him.

01:50.100 --> 01:53.750
"Now, I can give her some rotten apples," she said.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.350
His friend was very surprised.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.900
"You have won the bet," he said.

01:59.150 --> 02:00.650
"Here is the bar of gold."

02:00.800 --> 02:03.000
"You are the luckiest man in the world!"

02:03.250 --> 02:05.700
"You have a wife who always agrees with you."
