00:02.100 --> 00:07.600
The little mermaid lived at the bottom of the sea with her father, grandmother, and five sisters.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.500
She was not like her sisters.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.150
They were happy living in the sea.

00:14.100 --> 00:16.200
The little mermaid was not happy.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.700
But she could not leave the sea.

00:19.400 --> 00:23.000
She had to wait until she was 15 years old.

00:23.900 --> 00:27.650
At last, the little mermaid was 15 years old.

00:28.800 --> 00:33.850
"Now, you can go up out of the sea," said her grandmother.

00:34.750 --> 00:37.550
The little mermaid swam up out of the sea.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.300
She saw a big ship, and she swam near it.

00:41.900 --> 00:43.300
One of them was a young man.

00:43.900 --> 00:45.150
He was a prince.

00:45.950 --> 00:48.450
"He is very handsome," she thought.

00:48.900 --> 00:50.150
"I want to meet him."

00:50.400 --> 00:53.200
Then, suddenly a storm hit the ship.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.750
The prince fell into the sea.

00:56.600 --> 00:57.700
He could not swim.

00:58.350 --> 01:01.550
"I must help the prince," thought the little mermaid.

01:02.300 --> 01:05.050
She pulled him close to land and pushed him onto it.

01:05.650 --> 01:08.150
Then, she swam away from the prince.

01:08.750 --> 01:11.550
"He does not know I saved him," she thought.

01:12.300 --> 01:15.100
She slowly swam back to the bottom of the sea.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.150
"No," the little mermaid thought.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.600
"I want to live with the prince."

01:21.050 --> 01:23.500
"I will ask the sea witch for help."

01:25.200 --> 01:30.450
"I will not help you for free," the sea witch said.

01:31.050 --> 01:35.650
"I want your beautiful voice."

01:36.300 --> 01:39.300
"I will turn your tail into legs."

01:40.000 --> 01:48.250
"But if you do this, you will never live at the bottom of the sea with your family again."

01:48.800 --> 01:53.450
"You will also die if the prince does not marry you."

01:54.400 --> 01:58.750
The little mermaid really wanted to be with the prince, so she agreed.
