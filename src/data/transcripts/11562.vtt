The critics say, I'm arrogant,...

00:25.920 --> 00:26.550
...a doper,...

00:30.690 --> 00:31.250
...washed-up,...

00:34.630 --> 00:35.300
...a fraud,...

00:40.040 --> 00:41.170
...that I couldn't let it go.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.370
They can say whatever they want.

00:48.110 --> 00:49.380
I'm not back on my bike...

00:49.910 --> 00:50.380
...for them.
