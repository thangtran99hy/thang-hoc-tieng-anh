I get asked to do commercials all the time and I always say the same thing.

00:03.400 --> 00:05.200
First, I need some hot chicks.

00:05.250 --> 00:08.400
Second, we film at my house so I ain't gotta go anywhere.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.400
Third, I record my own song.

00:10.500 --> 00:15.500
Bring it, cool refreshing iced tea, drink it!

00:15.550 --> 00:17.900
But once I try their products, I always hate 'em!

00:18.050 --> 00:18.900
So I bounce.

00:20.450 --> 00:22.250
Damn! That is pretty good!

00:22.350 --> 00:23.400
But I got one final demand.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.700
No, we can't change the name to Eminem, shut up and drink it.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.900
See? That's why I don't do commercials.
