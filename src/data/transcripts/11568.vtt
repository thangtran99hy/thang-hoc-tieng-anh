00:04.803 --> 00:06.403
I got a question for you.

00:08.254 --> 00:10.780
What does this city know about luxury?

00:12.719 --> 00:18.017
What does a town that's been to hell and back know about the finer things in life?

00:19.766 --> 00:20.893
Well, I'll tell you.

00:21.802 --> 00:23.117
More than most.

00:24.262 --> 00:28.735
You see, it's the hottest fires that make the hardest steel,...

00:31.259 --> 00:33.826
...add hard work and conviction,...

00:34.197 --> 00:38.983
...and the know-how that runs generations deep in every last one of us.

00:41.710 --> 00:43.225
That's who we are.

00:43.628 --> 00:45.569
That's our story.

00:46.303 --> 00:49.899
Now, it's probably not the one you've been reading in papers.

00:50.160 --> 00:53.863
The one being written by folks who have never even been here...

00:54.089 --> 00:56.197
...and don't know what we're capable of.

00:56.895 --> 01:03.341
Because when it comes to luxury, it's as much about where it's from as who it's for.

01:05.019 --> 01:06.761
Now, we're from America,...

01:07.329 --> 01:09.327
...but this isn't New York City,...

01:10.047 --> 01:11.593
...or the Windy City,...

01:11.837 --> 01:12.991
...or Sin City,...

01:13.233 --> 01:16.056
...and we're certainly no one's Emerald City.

01:42.337 --> 01:43.733
This is the Motor City...

01:44.652 --> 01:45.853
...and this is what we do.
