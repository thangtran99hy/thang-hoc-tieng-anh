00:00.800 --> 00:02.400
Welcome to 4G.

00:02.550 --> 00:02.800
Cut!

00:04.100 --> 00:05.370
Don't touch my hair, man!

00:05.470 --> 00:07.440
This is the new version, this is the 5G.

00:07.770 --> 00:08.770
No, no it's 4G.

00:08.870 --> 00:10.110
It's just 5G.

00:12.940 --> 00:15.210
This is 5G,...

00:15.710 --> 00:16.280
...I think.

00:16.480 --> 00:17.910
It's a 5G.

00:18.110 --> 00:18.710
What're you talking about?

00:18.860 --> 00:22.020
Just a 5G, just say a 5, just say 5G.

00:22.580 --> 00:27.560
All aboard the 5G train. How many bloody Gs are there?

00:30.360 --> 00:31.090
I'll take it from here.

00:32.490 --> 00:32.790
Okay.

00:32.960 --> 00:34.930
All right, we're gonna lose Ozzy and bring in the new one.

00:36.500 --> 00:37.070
Marker.

00:37.230 --> 00:38.470
Ozzy is in the background, guys.

00:38.570 --> 00:38.830
What?

00:38.930 --> 00:39.830
He's in the background.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.040
Is this the way out?

00:41.200 --> 00:42.540
The new Buy Back program.

00:42.900 --> 00:45.710
You buy it now, we buy it back when it's time to upgrade.

00:47.310 --> 00:48.700
It's Bieber, 6G fever.

00:52.810 --> 00:53.880
What's a 6G?

00:54.120 --> 00:55.750
What the... is a Bieber?

00:55.850 --> 00:57.320
I don't know, kinda looks like a girl.
