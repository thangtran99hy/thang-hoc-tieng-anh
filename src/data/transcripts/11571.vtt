Sara, long time no see.

00:05.870 --> 00:07.940
Hi! Your sister looked beautiful.

00:08.040 --> 00:11.540
Oh, thanks! You too. You know, you look like you've lost a ton of weight.

00:15.010 --> 00:16.330
Do you see that girl over there with the brown hair?

00:17.410 --> 00:18.580
Really high-maintenance.

00:19.850 --> 00:20.970
That's my fiancee.

00:25.490 --> 00:26.150
Hey, Aunt Kay!

00:26.390 --> 00:28.390
Hey, it's Barbara.

00:29.460 --> 00:33.400
Oh, right. Sorry. Yeah, Kay was my Uncle Bill's second wife.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.460
Yes, I know that.

00:37.630 --> 00:38.120
Sorry.

00:46.710 --> 00:50.110
Can I have your attention? Can I have everyone's attention, please?

00:51.250 --> 00:53.880
I'd like to say a few words about my sister.

00:54.080 --> 00:54.820
Oh, no.

00:55.090 --> 00:59.090
Well, I'm not really very good at this kind of thing but here it goes.

00:59.450 --> 01:00.690
Oh, this is gonna be good.

01:01.890 --> 01:02.490
Angie,...

01:04.290 --> 01:07.530
...you've been blessed to find someone you can move through this life with.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.800
Together, you've learned that love doesn't just happen.

01:12.830 --> 01:16.540
You have to create it, craft it, and nurture it.

01:17.710 --> 01:21.080
It can be even better when it's been held in the palm of the hand...

01:21.680 --> 01:22.710
...and cradled for a while.

01:24.380 --> 01:26.420
You've grown a love that is enduring,...

01:28.150 --> 01:29.150
...stunning in its beauty.

01:30.850 --> 01:35.360
Congratulations on your wedding and continuing to create your lives together.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.250
I didn't actually write those words...

01:45.100 --> 01:46.230
...but I do mean them.

01:51.310 --> 01:51.940
I love you, Angie.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.510
That was beautiful, Chris.

01:55.910 --> 01:58.350
Now, eat up everyone, my mom paid like two grand for that cake.
