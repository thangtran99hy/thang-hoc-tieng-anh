00:00.011 --> 00:04.750
And now the Soviets themselves may, in a limited way,...

00:05.250 --> 00:08.100
...be coming to understand the importance of freedom.

00:08.950 --> 00:12.900
We hear much from Moscow about a new policy of reform and openness.

00:13.600 --> 00:16.000
Some political prisoners have been released.

00:16.550 --> 00:20.200
Certain foreign news broadcasts are no longer being jammed.

00:20.950 --> 00:26.150
Some economic enterprises have been permitted to operate with greater freedom from state control.

00:27.250 --> 00:31.800
Are these the beginnings of profound changes in the Soviet state?

00:32.750 --> 00:38.100
Or are they token gestures intended to raise false hopes in the West,...

00:38.500 --> 00:41.800
...or to strengthen the Soviet system without changing it?

00:43.150 --> 00:45.600
We welcome change and openness,...

00:46.150 --> 00:49.700
...for we believe that freedom and security go together,...

00:51.000 --> 00:59.550
...that the advance of human liberty can only strengthen the cause of world peace.

01:00.600 --> 01:04.950
There is one sign the Soviets can make that would be unmistakable,...

01:06.200 --> 01:10.800
...that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace.

01:12.150 --> 01:16.550
General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace,...

01:17.300 --> 01:21.200
...if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,...

01:22.150 --> 01:23.900
...if you seek liberalization,...

01:24.800 --> 01:26.300
...come here to this gate!

01:27.250 --> 01:30.650
Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate!

01:46.700 --> 01:50.750
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!
