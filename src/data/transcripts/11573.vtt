00:00.450 --> 00:02.000
We shall go on to the end.

00:02.950 --> 00:04.650
We shall fight in France.

00:05.350 --> 00:07.700
We shall fight on the seas and oceans.

00:08.500 --> 00:13.050
We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.

00:14.450 --> 00:17.800
We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.050
We shall fight on the beaches.

00:20.700 --> 00:22.800
We shall fight on the landing grounds.

00:23.400 --> 00:26.750
We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.

00:27.100 --> 00:28.700
We shall fight in the hills.

00:29.550 --> 00:30.900
We shall never surrender.

00:31.450 --> 00:35.200
And if, which I do not for a moment believe,...

00:36.050 --> 00:40.700
...this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving,...

00:41.500 --> 00:47.500
...then our empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet...

00:48.200 --> 00:49.750
...would carry on the struggle.

00:50.300 --> 00:56.100
Until, in God's good time, the new world, with all its power and might...

00:56.500 --> 01:00.500
...steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.
