00:01.200 --> 00:03.430
Dating while you're unemployed.

00:04.570 --> 00:06.230
Alright, you're in between jobs.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.670
But the heart wants what the heart wants...

00:09.140 --> 00:11.070
...and other parts of the body have their own agenda.

00:11.610 --> 00:14.580
Just because your resources are low doesn't mean you quit dating...

00:15.010 --> 00:16.540
...especially if the right lady comes along.

00:18.650 --> 00:21.180
Don't sweat it Darren. If you heed these nuggets of wisdom,...

00:21.520 --> 00:24.420
...you'll be adapting and overcoming like the greatest generation did.

00:25.290 --> 00:26.350
They're great daters.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.360
There's such a thing as too much honesty.

00:29.790 --> 00:31.660
Nobody wants to hear about your money woes...

00:32.030 --> 00:33.960
...particularly when you're first courting a lady.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.500
So, what are we gonna do tonight?

00:37.030 --> 00:42.840
Well, I thought we'd enjoy some easy listening and some beef stew.

00:45.770 --> 00:47.240
Now, I'm not telling you to lie...

00:47.540 --> 00:50.250
...but there's no reason to wear your bank statement on your forehead.

00:50.610 --> 00:54.520
She likes you that's why she's here. It's your job not to mess that up.

00:58.690 --> 01:00.160
So, what are we gonna do tonight?

01:00.720 --> 01:03.860
Well, it's such a beautiful night I thought we'd start with a walk by the beach.

01:04.260 --> 01:04.860
That's great.

01:05.760 --> 01:08.960
Men, the quality of a date is not measured by its price tag.

01:09.360 --> 01:12.930
Wherever you live, there's bound to be plenty of free and fun activities...

01:13.130 --> 01:14.570
...that won't impact your net worth.

01:15.040 --> 01:18.700
So have a ball and drop the white man's overbite though when you're dancing.

01:18.940 --> 01:19.940
That's fun for no one.

01:20.740 --> 01:23.510
Having a fixed budget can actually be a blessing in disguise.

01:23.710 --> 01:27.020
It'll force you to be more creative, something every girl appreciates.

01:27.480 --> 01:31.850
Try putting a new spin on an old favorite like that American classic, dinner and a movie.

01:33.620 --> 01:35.020
Well played, Mr. Romance.

01:35.290 --> 01:39.230
Comfort food and good company, it's the little known secret to a woman's heart.

01:39.790 --> 01:42.860
This is the best macaroni and cheese I have ever had.

01:43.130 --> 01:43.950
I'm glad you like it.

01:45.170 --> 01:46.370
And that's not all I like.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.540
Mission accomplished Darren.

01:48.900 --> 01:52.340
You know, you could be giving the boys in Washington a few tips about stretching a dollar.

01:52.810 --> 01:56.110
Until next time, enjoy being a man who gets the tough things done.
