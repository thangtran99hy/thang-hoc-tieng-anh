00:02.260 --> 00:05.430
One very hot day, Lion went to the sea.

00:05.700 --> 00:09.340
Just as Lion walked into the sea, Sea Dragon swam up.

00:09.670 --> 00:12.470
"This is my sea," Sea Dragon said.

00:12.870 --> 00:18.550
"You must stay out of it. Now show me your strength," Sea Dragon said to Lion.

00:19.280 --> 00:22.120
Some monkeys heard Lion talking to Sea Dragon.

00:22.980 --> 00:25.420
"We must help Lion," one of them said.

00:25.650 --> 00:28.820
Golden Rabbit turned to his friend, the Black Mynah Bird.

00:29.620 --> 00:33.830
"Fly everywhere and tell all the animals to come here as soon as they can."

00:34.200 --> 00:37.400
Soon, animals of every kind came to the meeting.

00:37.770 --> 00:41.000
Golden Rabbit said, "Lion is in danger."

00:41.370 --> 00:46.110
"But we know that only the dragon-eating Galon Bird can beat Sea Dragon."

00:46.510 --> 00:52.110
"Therefore, we must find an animal who can pretend to be the dragon-eating Galon Bird."

00:52.810 --> 00:55.180
A very big bird walked forward.

00:55.720 --> 00:59.450
"I can help, my name is Quilt Bird."

00:59.990 --> 01:05.890
Golden Rabbit said, "You are very big, but Sea Dragon will not be afraid of you."

01:06.260 --> 01:07.960
"But I have a plan."

01:08.430 --> 01:12.800
The next day, Lion and all the animals hid behind some trees near the sea.

01:13.470 --> 01:15.940
Golden Rabbit walked toward the sea.

01:16.600 --> 01:22.840
Sea Dragon swam up. "So a rabbit is going to fight me instead of Lion."

01:23.180 --> 01:25.050
Black Mynah Bird made a noise.

01:25.280 --> 01:28.720
Then, all the animals made as much noise as they could.

01:29.020 --> 01:35.390
"That noise is the dragon-eating Galon Bird," Golden Rabbit said, "she's very hungry."

01:35.660 --> 01:38.490
Sea Dragon was swimming away as fast as he could.
