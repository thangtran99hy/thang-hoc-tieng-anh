00:00.100 --> 00:04.000
All we say to America is, "Be true to what you said on paper."

00:10.100 --> 00:16.000
If I lived in China or even Russia, or any totalitarian country,...

00:17.850 --> 00:23.800
...maybe, I could understand some of these illegal injunctions.

00:25.200 --> 00:30.300
Maybe, I could understand the denial of certain, basic First Amendment privileges,...

00:30.350 --> 00:34.400
...because they hadn't committed themselves to that over there.

00:35.300 --> 00:39.600
But somewhere, I read of the freedom of assembly.

00:40.150 --> 00:43.700
Somewhere, I read of the freedom of speech.

00:44.100 --> 00:47.700
Somewhere, I read of the freedom of press.

00:48.250 --> 00:55.050
Somewhere, I read that the greatness of America is the right to protest for right.

01:02.350 --> 01:08.000
And so just as I say, we aren't gonna let any dogs or water hoses turn us around.

01:08.350 --> 01:11.800
We aren't gonna let any injunction turn us around.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.400
Well, I don't know what will happen now.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.950
We've got some difficult days ahead,...

01:26.750 --> 01:28.400
...but it really doesn't matter with me now,...

01:29.400 --> 01:31.100
...because I've been to the mountaintop,...

01:33.500 --> 01:34.400
...I don't mind.

01:38.550 --> 01:43.350
Like anybody, I would like to live a long life.

01:43.450 --> 01:46.650
Longevity has its place,...

01:47.800 --> 01:50.000
...but I'm not concerned about that now.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.550
I just wanna do God's will.

01:55.550 --> 01:58.050
And he's allowed me to go up to the mountain,...

01:59.400 --> 02:00.450
...and I've looked over,...

02:02.100 --> 02:05.550
...and I've seen the promised land.

02:07.100 --> 02:08.800
I may not get there with you,...

02:09.850 --> 02:11.650
...but I want you to know tonight...

02:12.700 --> 02:16.500
...that we, as a people, will get to the promised land!

02:22.600 --> 02:23.900
So, I'm happy tonight.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.150
I'm not worried about anything.

02:26.300 --> 02:28.350
I'm not fearing any man!

02:28.650 --> 02:32.550
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.
