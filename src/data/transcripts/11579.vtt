So, yeah. Sorry about last night.

00:01.650 --> 00:03.150
I just don't understand why you didn't call.

00:03.250 --> 00:04.550
Yeah. Well, I was on E*Trade.

00:04.650 --> 00:08.150
You know, diversifying my portfolio, taking control, like a wolf.

00:08.350 --> 00:08.725
Right.

00:08.800 --> 00:09.200
What's that?

00:09.300 --> 00:13.250
There's volatility in the market? Taken care of, wolf style.

00:19.050 --> 00:21.400
And that milkaholic Lindsay wasn't over?

00:22.800 --> 00:23.400
Lindsay?

00:24.450 --> 00:25.300
Milk... what?

00:26.900 --> 00:29.800
Build a diversified portfolio at E*TRADE.
