One thing the world needs, one thing this country desperately needs...

00:21.751 --> 00:25.138
...is a better way of conducting our political debates.

00:25.925 --> 00:30.153
We need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.867
If you think about the arguments we have,...

00:38.998 --> 00:42.981
...most of the time it's shouting matches on cable television,...

00:43.519 --> 00:46.431
...ideological food fights on the floor of Congress.

00:48.077 --> 00:49.016
I have a suggestion.

00:50.237 --> 00:54.455
Look at all of the arguments we have these days over health care,...

00:55.259 --> 00:57.709
...over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street,...

00:58.834 --> 01:04.172
...over the gap between rich and poor, over affirmative action and same-sex marriage.

01:04.563 --> 01:08.919
Lying just beneath the surface of those arguments,...

01:09.613 --> 01:11.871
...with passions raging on all sides,...

01:12.684 --> 01:18.451
...are big questions of moral philosophy, big questions of justice.

01:19.424 --> 01:29.369
But we too rarely articulate and defend and argue about those big moral questions in our politics.

01:29.481 --> 01:33.733
So, what I would like to do today is have something of a discussion.

01:34.808 --> 01:37.845
First, let me take a famous philosopher...

01:38.682 --> 01:41.989
...who wrote about those questions of justice and morality,...

01:42.591 --> 01:47.385
...give you a very short lecture on Aristotle of ancient Athens,...

01:47.445 --> 01:49.237
...Aristotle's theory of justice,...

01:49.991 --> 01:51.757
...and then have a discussion here...

01:52.255 --> 02:00.097
...to see whether Aristotle's ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today.

02:01.276 --> 02:02.595
So, are you ready for the lecture?

02:05.523 --> 02:10.878
According to Aristotle, justice means giving people what they deserve.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.285
That's it. That's the lecture.

02:18.203 --> 02:21.601
Now, you may say, "Well, that's obvious enough." The real questions begin...

02:22.219 --> 02:26.963
...when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why.
