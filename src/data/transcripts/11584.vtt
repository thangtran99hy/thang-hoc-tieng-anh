00:02.350 --> 00:05.950
Some of the white men had lived at Fort Yukon for several years.

00:06.650 --> 00:10.400
They liked to watch the Native Americans' dogs, especially White Fang,...

00:10.700 --> 00:12.650
...attack and kill the newcomers' dogs.

00:13.150 --> 00:15.000
One of these men was called Beauty.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.050
Every day, he gave the dog a beating.

00:18.950 --> 00:21.800
Almost beaten to death daily by this bad man,...

00:22.200 --> 00:24.800
...White Fang became more dangerous to other dogs.

00:25.550 --> 00:27.800
Beauty used White Fang as a fighting dog.

00:28.300 --> 00:30.750
He became famous as, "The Fighting Wolf,"...

00:31.300 --> 00:34.600
...and men came from near and far to watch him fight other dogs.

00:35.450 --> 00:37.200
Scott had heard about White Fang.

00:37.900 --> 00:40.600
He knew he was one of the best lead sled dogs ever.

00:41.100 --> 00:44.050
"I'll buy that dog from you," he told Beauty.

00:44.650 --> 00:46.500
"A hundred and fifty dollars."

00:47.450 --> 00:51.900
White Fang slowly got better and during this time, he did not let anyone near him.

00:52.550 --> 00:55.700
"He's going to be useless," Scott said to Matt.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.900
"I've wasted my money."

00:58.300 --> 01:00.100
"I'll get my gun and shoot him."

01:00.900 --> 01:03.200
"Give him more time," Matt said.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.800
"He doesn't like you because of that man, Beauty."

01:06.250 --> 01:08.050
"He needs to learn that we won't hurt him."

01:08.900 --> 01:10.650
Every day, Scott touched the dog.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.350
White Fang began to like being touched.

01:14.050 --> 01:18.150
He began to like this god who gave him meat, touched him gently, and never beat him.

01:19.150 --> 01:21.800
He knew that this god was different from all the others.

01:22.550 --> 01:25.650
As the days passed, White Fang began to love Scott.

01:26.200 --> 01:29.900
He lived the rest of his life quietly with Scott and his family,...

01:30.100 --> 01:32.900
...a much gentler, and much loved wolf dog.
