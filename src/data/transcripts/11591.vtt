My name is Kosei Inoue.

00:21.380 --> 00:24.120
I won the gold medal at the Sydney Olympics...

00:25.890 --> 00:28.490
...and the gold in three world championships.

00:33.530 --> 00:36.200
It's been one and a half year since I came here.

00:37.030 --> 00:43.440
I was sent by the JOC, Japanese Olympic Committee, as a visiting trainee coach.

00:50.650 --> 00:56.450
A judo master called Mr. Gonichi Koizumi came from Japan and spread judo here...

00:58.390 --> 01:00.290
...and he established this training school.

01:01.120 --> 01:05.060
In those days, a number of judo masters traveled around the world...

01:05.290 --> 01:08.330
...to spread judo beyond Japan for the first time...

01:13.340 --> 01:17.700
...and we have to respect this historical effort of our former masters,...

01:19.510 --> 01:22.710
...and pass this legacy onto future generations.

01:26.150 --> 01:29.180
I think that British people are always looking forward...

01:31.550 --> 01:33.390
...and expect a bright future.

01:34.120 --> 01:38.090
At the same time, they respect traditions and preserve them well.

01:39.960 --> 01:41.930
This is very similar to Japan.

01:49.240 --> 01:51.840
I teach the advanced level athletes.

01:55.880 --> 02:00.700
Basically, the training consists of free fight practice and pinning techniques.

02:05.920 --> 02:12.000
English people are the majority, but people from other countries are also here to practice judo.
