00:05.000 --> 00:11.800
Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation,...

00:12.600 --> 00:18.600
...conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

00:20.800 --> 00:23.500
Now we are engaged in a great civil war,...

00:24.600 --> 00:31.400
...testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.650
We are met on a great battlefield of that war.

00:38.200 --> 00:42.400
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place...

00:43.000 --> 00:46.700
...for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.

00:48.400 --> 00:52.150
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

00:54.350 --> 00:58.450
But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate,...

00:59.550 --> 01:01.150
...we cannot consecrate,...

01:02.100 --> 01:04.550
...we cannot hallow this ground.

01:06.150 --> 01:12.700
The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it...

01:12.850 --> 01:16.200
...far above our poor power to add or detract.

01:18.250 --> 01:22.550
The world will little note nor long remember what we say here,...

01:22.700 --> 01:25.500
...but it can never forget what they did here.

01:27.900 --> 01:31.800
It is for us the living rather,...

01:32.850 --> 01:39.600
...to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.

01:40.950 --> 01:46.550
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us,...

01:47.550 --> 01:52.100
...that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause...

01:52.150 --> 01:55.000
...for which they gave the last full measure of devotion,...

01:56.350 --> 02:01.950
...that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain,...

02:02.950 --> 02:08.750
...that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom,...

02:10.150 --> 02:16.650
...and that government of the people, by the people, for the people...

02:18.150 --> 02:20.950
...shall not perish from the Earth.
