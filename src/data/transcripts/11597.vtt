I'm Reem Alasadi. I'm a fashion designer born in Iraq.

00:19.850 --> 00:23.750
I've made Britain my home and this is 'See Britain Through My Eyes.'

00:32.790 --> 00:34.560
Portobello market,...

00:35.960 --> 00:37.470
...the best place in the world.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.470
I've been coming here for years...

00:41.600 --> 00:46.780
...looking for things that we could probably remake, recycle.

00:49.280 --> 00:53.350
When I hit a flea market, it's like a child in a sweetie shop.

00:54.580 --> 00:57.990
My eyes pop open even bigger.

00:59.520 --> 01:00.890
Can I pick up some things?

01:03.220 --> 01:08.000
The clothes here tell a huge story about Britain.

01:09.430 --> 01:14.570
Everything is a fabric of the nation, you know, liberty print, the little flowers.

01:16.540 --> 01:18.670
These are obviously not Indian clothes,...

01:18.770 --> 01:23.340
...but it's, she's adapted them and made them there and brought them back here.

01:23.810 --> 01:28.620
And then right next door you've got Aquascutum and you can't get more English than Aquascutum.

01:29.080 --> 01:34.720
It's this kind of multicultural society that we live in which is absolutely beautiful.

01:44.300 --> 01:49.270
In Britain here, there are many symbols like,...

01:49.470 --> 01:53.580
...you know, the face of the Queen on the coins, the Union Jacks,...

01:53.880 --> 01:57.750
...all these things that you feel like you can own, you can play with...

01:57.910 --> 02:01.250
...but you don't feel like anybody is going to put you in prison for them.
