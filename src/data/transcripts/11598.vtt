00:21.400 --> 00:24.150
IFRS is clearly more than an exercise in accounting.

00:24.250 --> 00:27.400
And I think that's one of the biggest fallacies that companies have...

00:27.500 --> 00:32.200
...as they are approaching the adoption of IFRS as nothing more than an accounting exercise.

00:32.500 --> 00:36.550
When in reality, it impacts a number of different aspects of a company's business.

00:36.900 --> 00:39.350
For example, not only is the accounting relevant,...

00:39.650 --> 00:44.650
...but probably even more critical than the accounting aspect is the information technology,...

00:45.000 --> 00:47.400
...and the impact that it may have on your IT systems.

00:47.550 --> 00:51.450
IFRS is, first and foremost of course, an accounting policy exercise,...

00:51.850 --> 00:55.150
...which is like any other time that you're changing the way that you do business.

00:55.250 --> 01:00.200
It has the potential of having fundamental impact to your people, to your processes,...

01:00.550 --> 01:04.900
...frankly down to the underlying transactional systems that derive your financial statements.

01:05.100 --> 01:08.150
When you look at the accounting issues that impact technology companies,...

01:08.250 --> 01:14.200
...there's probably no issue that is more dear to every technology company's heart than revenue recognition.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.250
And clearly, as you look at the major accounting principles,...

01:17.400 --> 01:19.900
...that's going to be number one on every company's list.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.350
One of the areas that has the potential for creating a lot of change from a technology company perspective...

01:25.400 --> 01:27.350
...is in the area of research and development.

01:27.950 --> 01:34.750
You know, under US GAAP policies, most of our clients expense both research and development costs.

01:34.900 --> 01:40.150
Under IFRS, there's the opportunity or in fact, the requirement to capitalize research cost.

01:40.500 --> 01:41.900
Seems simple on its face.

01:42.250 --> 01:46.500
The reality of it is, though it has implications to not only the accounting policy first,...

01:46.600 --> 01:49.700
...but the processes, the people, the systems.

01:49.850 --> 01:55.600
This is an area where software companies have been required for 20 - plus years to capitalize their development cost.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.450
Not the research, but just the development.

01:57.850 --> 02:03.050
This is an area now that under IFRS, all technology companies will be required to look at.

02:03.100 --> 02:09.200
But not only are there potentially people impacts in terms of software engineers now having to account for their time,...

02:09.500 --> 02:12.400
...you have to have systems that are gonna be able to track that time,...

02:13.650 --> 02:16.950
...and then a way to be able to get that data all the way to the general ledger,...

02:17.000 --> 02:19.200
...to be able to get those numbers out of the system.

02:19.350 --> 02:24.200
So, one of the things that we suggest companies look for and try to do or perform early on...

02:24.300 --> 02:26.550
...is some type of what we would call a gap analysis.

02:26.850 --> 02:29.950
Looking at the differences between your current accounting,...

02:30.050 --> 02:33.700
...whether that's US GAAP or whatever standard you're on and IFRS,...

02:33.800 --> 02:39.200
...and identify those major areas that will require significant change between what you're doing now,...

02:39.550 --> 02:42.850
...and what you'll need to do when you adopt to IFRS.
