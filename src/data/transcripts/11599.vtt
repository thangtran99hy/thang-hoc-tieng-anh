When people would have asked me the question back in 1993,...

00:07.800 --> 00:14.300
...whether I thought that international accounting standards would ever reach this side of the pond,...

00:14.400 --> 00:18.050
...would ever be used by the SCC without reconciliation to US GAAP,...

00:18.400 --> 00:22.100
...I would have said, "There is not a chance in the world that that's gonna happen."

00:24.650 --> 00:30.900
But what happened was, you know, over the years, again, this groundswell was coming out of Europe principally,...

00:31.600 --> 00:34.650
...big companies were saying, "Why do I have to bother with your crazy standards?"

00:35.400 --> 00:39.000
"We've got this international - based set of standards that are getting better and better."

00:39.350 --> 00:44.300
And by the way, in 2002 in Europe, the European Commission said,...

00:44.800 --> 00:49.300
..."Any company that wants to raise capital in the public markets here"...

00:50.200 --> 00:55.700
..."will have to use international accounting standards for their 2005 financial statements."

00:56.300 --> 00:57.400
That was a huge event...

00:57.850 --> 01:04.250
...and really, I think, represented a tremendous breakthrough for non - US companies.

01:05.050 --> 01:11.250
And I would say that probably one of the biggest reasons why international accounting standards...

01:11.650 --> 01:14.800
...started to gain much more support was Enron.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.100
Now, if you look at the Enron situation,...

01:17.650 --> 01:23.400
...they constructed all these elaborate partnerships and arrangements to get assets off the balance sheet,...

01:24.150 --> 01:26.700
...and US GAAP is famous for having these crazy rules.

01:26.950 --> 01:29.950
You know, you take the amount that you've invested in the company,...

01:30.500 --> 01:34.500
...you divide that by the gross national product and your shoe size,...

01:34.750 --> 01:38.100
...and you end up with an answer to the magical, you know, question.

01:39.650 --> 01:43.700
And lo and behold, Enron, the bottom fell out of that.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.400
And, you know, suddenly, US GAAP didn't look so much like the gold standard anymore.

01:48.800 --> 01:55.300
And in fact, there was a huge backlash around all these cumbersome rules and how you get,...

01:55.450 --> 01:57.100
...you know, as soon as you create an accounting rule,...

01:57.450 --> 01:59.650
...you'll have a sea of investment bankers that come out of the woodwork...

01:59.700 --> 02:03.400
...and try to sell you a product that will help you to navigate around those rules.

02:03.850 --> 02:04.900
And that's what did in Enron.
