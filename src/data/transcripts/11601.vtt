00:01.130 --> 00:05.300
Rakuten Travel operates Japan's largest internet hotel reservation site,...

00:05.630 --> 00:09.670
...serving an accumulative total of over 100 million users as of 2008.

00:10.870 --> 00:14.040
The reason we upgraded to Oracle Database 11G...

00:14.580 --> 00:18.450
...was to serve more customers by expanding the system capability.

00:20.680 --> 00:26.990
Another reason for upgrading to Oracle Database 11G was to boost data search speeds.

00:31.890 --> 00:35.030
Currently, we are using Oracle Automatic Storage Management...

00:35.360 --> 00:39.630
...and Oracle Clusterware as a foundation for all our Rakuten Travel systems.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.440
In addition, we are using Oracle Enterprise Manager for managing operations.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.180
We chose Oracle Database products,...

00:51.380 --> 00:57.120
...primarily because they enable us to offer a more stable service to our customers on a continuous basis.

00:57.850 --> 01:02.260
Also, we highly value Oracle's extremely comprehensive support system.

01:05.360 --> 01:08.460
By investing in Oracle database and hardware upgrades,...

01:08.900 --> 01:12.630
...we have been able to achieve a 60% increase in performance,...

01:13.130 --> 01:16.670
...providing the maximum return for the least investment.

01:20.410 --> 01:22.780
By using Automatic Storage Management,...

01:23.080 --> 01:26.680
...we have been able to reduce operational and management cost,...

01:26.880 --> 01:32.650
...by eliminating the work our database engineers had to perform two to three times a month.

01:35.690 --> 01:40.160
In the past when we needed to add nodes, we had to shut down the database system.

01:40.660 --> 01:45.170
But now with the adoption of Oracle Clusterware, we are able to add nodes online,...

01:45.430 --> 01:48.140
...reducing the amount of downtime to the bare minimum.

01:50.270 --> 01:52.670
Amid the current austere economic conditions,...

01:53.140 --> 01:57.450
...Oracle has helped us a great deal: generating the maximum return...

01:57.910 --> 02:00.750
...whilst cutting downtime and keeping cost to the minimum.
