People say you have to have a lot of passion for what you're doing...

00:04.767 --> 00:05.650
...and it's totally true.

00:05.733 --> 00:09.983
And the reason is, because it's so hard,...

00:10.367 --> 00:13.250
...that if you don't, any rational person would give up.

00:14.167 --> 00:17.517
It's really hard and you have to do it over a sustained period of time.

00:17.733 --> 00:18.650
So, if you don't love it,...

00:19.033 --> 00:21.250
...if you're not having fun doing it and you don't really love it,...

00:22.233 --> 00:23.050
...you're gonna give up.

00:23.467 --> 00:24.883
And that's what happens to most people, actually.

00:24.967 --> 00:28.424
If you really look at the ones that ended up,...

00:28.747 --> 00:30.950
...you know, being successful unquote in the eyes of society,...

00:31.033 --> 00:35.383
...and the ones that didn't, oftentimes it's the ones that are successful love what they did,...

00:35.459 --> 00:38.250
...so they could persevere when, you know, it got really tough.

00:39.233 --> 00:43.983
And the ones that didn't love it quit because they're sane, right?

00:44.100 --> 00:45.817
Who would wanna put up with this stuff if you don't love it?

00:46.300 --> 00:50.383
So, it's a lot of hard work and it's a lot of worrying constantly.

00:50.867 --> 00:55.317
And if you don't love it, you're gonna fail.

00:55.533 --> 00:57.117
So, you've gotta love it, you've gotta have passion,...

00:57.633 --> 00:59.017
...and I think that's the high order bit.

00:59.100 --> 01:04.650
The second thing is you've gotta be a really good talent scout.

01:05.367 --> 01:09.117
'Cause no matter how smart you are, you need a team of great people.

01:09.667 --> 01:14.150
And you've gotta figure out how to size people up fairly quickly,...

01:14.233 --> 01:16.383
...make decisions without knowing people too well,...

01:16.833 --> 01:19.917
...and hire them and, you know, see how you do, and refine your intuition.

01:20.300 --> 01:25.850
And be able to help, you know, build an organization that can eventually just build itself,...

01:26.667 --> 01:27.850
...'cause you need great people around you.
