00:01.660 --> 00:01.930
Two.

00:02.530 --> 00:03.370
Do you have a reservation?

00:03.870 --> 00:04.470
Superman.

00:06.000 --> 00:06.770
I don't see anything.

00:06.940 --> 00:08.170
Might be under "The Man of Steel".

00:08.440 --> 00:13.510
Man of Steel, Man of Steel. Oh yeah, Man of Steel. Right here. This way.

00:13.710 --> 00:14.840
Man of Steel.

00:15.180 --> 00:15.710
Why do you do that?

00:15.940 --> 00:16.850
Wanna sit by the kitchen?

00:17.010 --> 00:17.200
No.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.150
No, you don't.

00:18.550 --> 00:21.950
I mean, how could they put this much mayonnaise on tuna fish and expect people to eat it.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.750
What do you care? You're invulnerable to harm.

00:24.150 --> 00:26.790
It's not harm, it's too rich. Makes me queasy.

00:27.620 --> 00:28.200
Send it back.

00:28.490 --> 00:28.920
Nah.

00:29.820 --> 00:30.390
You got a little.

00:30.990 --> 00:31.230
Huh?

00:32.790 --> 00:33.230
Napkin?

00:33.600 --> 00:35.460
Why? It's impervious to stain.

00:36.060 --> 00:37.700
Excuse me, Superman?

00:37.970 --> 00:38.370
Yes.

00:38.530 --> 00:41.370
I don't know if you remember me, Barry Cats? You saved my life once.

00:41.470 --> 00:42.870
I was hanging from a train trestle.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.940
Yeah, sure, sure. How are you?

00:45.170 --> 00:49.140
Terrific. Great. I don't want to interrupt your meal, I just wanted to say thanks again.

00:49.240 --> 00:51.210
No, not a problem. It's good to see you again, Barry.

00:52.210 --> 00:54.820
He's the best. You're good, too.

00:54.980 --> 00:55.380
Thank you.

00:58.290 --> 00:58.750
Who was that?

00:59.090 --> 00:59.720
No idea.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.520
So, you wanna help me hook up this DVD?

01:02.790 --> 01:03.930
I thought we were going cycling?

01:04.230 --> 01:06.290
Nah, cycling with you is no fun.

01:06.660 --> 01:07.060
Why not?

01:08.400 --> 01:09.160
It's just not.

01:09.960 --> 01:11.770
Anyway, I wanna hear this thing. It's got surround sound.

01:12.000 --> 01:12.800
I've always wanted that.

01:13.470 --> 01:14.370
You've got super hearing.

01:14.500 --> 01:20.210
Yeah, but it's not surround sound. I mean, surround sound! It's like, it's like you're there.

01:20.780 --> 01:22.010
What are you talking about?

01:22.340 --> 01:24.310
So, did you go bowling with those people last night?

01:24.500 --> 01:26.580
No, I stayed home. I watched that rebound wedding.

01:26.750 --> 01:26.980
Oh!
