Hi everyone, I'm Brian Krueger with CollegeGrad.com and this is the Job Search Minute.

00:06.230 --> 00:08.000
Here's another tough interview question.

00:08.370 --> 00:09.540
Tell me about yourself.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.640
It seems like an easy question.

00:11.870 --> 00:12.710
It's open-ended.

00:12.940 --> 00:16.210
I can talk about whatever I want from the birth canal forward, right?

00:16.850 --> 00:21.580
Wrong, what the hiring manager really wants is a quick two - to - three - minute snapshot...

00:21.920 --> 00:25.450
...of who you are and why you're the best candidate for this position.

00:26.150 --> 00:30.860
So as you answer this question, talk about what you've been doing to prepare yourself...

00:31.230 --> 00:33.560
...to be the very best candidate for the position.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.060
Use an example or two to back it up.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.500
Then ask if they would like more details.

00:38.700 --> 00:43.810
If they do, keep giving them example after example of your background and experience.

00:44.440 --> 00:47.540
Always point back to an example when you have the opportunity.

00:48.180 --> 00:51.410
Tell me about yourself does not mean tell me everything.

00:51.810 --> 00:54.220
Just tell me about what makes you the best.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.680
This has been the job search minute.

00:56.890 --> 01:00.620
