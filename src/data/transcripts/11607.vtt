David Field is like many in America these days.

00:04.350 --> 00:07.350
He resolved to pay off debt and get in better financial shape.

00:07.550 --> 00:12.000
But unlike most of us, he didn't just talk about it, he actually did it.

00:12.300 --> 00:19.050
In total, altogether in debt, I was about $18,000 and now, I'm down to 6,000.

00:19.350 --> 00:20.350
How did he do this?

00:20.550 --> 00:22.800
Well, he went to a credit counseling agency.

00:22.850 --> 00:23.500
I called them up...

00:24.950 --> 00:27.500
...when he said, "Yeah, we can get you out in this amount of time," you know,...

00:27.750 --> 00:29.550
...he said about three and a half years, four years,...

00:29.600 --> 00:31.100
...and I was like, "That sounds fantastic to me!"

00:31.300 --> 00:35.000
In fact, it sounded so good that he decided to spread the message.

00:35.250 --> 00:38.700
He's now working as a counselor at the same agency that helped him.

00:39.150 --> 00:42.400
These agencies can create a plan that puts them between you and your creditors,...

00:42.650 --> 00:46.200
...or if all you need is a little advice, they can help with that too.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.200
Use cash.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.050
Stop using their credit cards.

00:49.450 --> 00:55.850
There's no way you're ever gonna get out of debt if you don't stop using those plastic things.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.600
Simple advice that would keep you from racking up new debt this year.

00:59.950 --> 01:02.000
And to eliminate the debt you already have,...

01:02.250 --> 01:03.900
...for that, you may need a plan.

01:04.150 --> 01:08.650
One that helps you find extra money that you can use to target debts for payoff.

01:08.850 --> 01:10.400
You have to do some soul-searching...

01:11.950 --> 01:17.700
...in order to design a plan that you're gonna stick to that will eliminate your debt.

01:18.050 --> 01:21.200
Bottom line, if you resolved to pay off some debt this year,...

01:21.450 --> 01:23.850
...stop talking the talk, start walking the walk!

01:24.150 --> 01:26.100
Cut up the cards, track your expenses.

01:26.300 --> 01:28.350
And if you need some help, find it.

01:28.850 --> 01:31.300
