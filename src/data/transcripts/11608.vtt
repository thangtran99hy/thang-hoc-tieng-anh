00:00.300 --> 00:02.300
You know, there's a new way to do marketing...

00:02.400 --> 00:03.750
...and it's to do it with numbers.

00:04.550 --> 00:06.500
People really do marketing to bring in revenue,...

00:06.600 --> 00:07.550
...to have an impact.

00:08.100 --> 00:10.300
And now, with these new systems, you can measure them.

00:10.850 --> 00:14.000
And it seems to me that with the kind of technologies that the Internet brings,...

00:14.075 --> 00:15.900
...you should be able to measure almost everything.

00:16.300 --> 00:18.600
Reach, whether people really buy things,...

00:18.800 --> 00:19.850
...whether they're really happy,...

00:20.150 --> 00:21.400
...whether they come back again,...

00:21.850 --> 00:24.550
...all of this is now possible because of the reach of the Internet.

00:25.100 --> 00:29.300
It's even more true with the mobile devices, and the platforms and applications,...

00:29.550 --> 00:30.850
...that everyone is building on today.
