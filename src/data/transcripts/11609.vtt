Hi, my name is Marc Mencher, president of GameRecruiter.com...

00:04.500 --> 00:08.300
...and we're here at DarkSide Game Studios in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

00:09.600 --> 00:15.250
The average salary for a video game programmer in our industry is about $85,000 base salary.

00:15.550 --> 00:19.250
On top of that, we have a bonus or a profit - sharing program,...

00:19.600 --> 00:24.500
...so although the salaries are slightly less starting off than you'd see in the general business community,...

00:25.050 --> 00:29.150
...those people do not have royalties or bonus programs like we see in the video game industry.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.550
So for example, the folks at id Software,...

00:31.800 --> 00:36.650
...none of them are crying about the million dollars bonus they get a year on top of their base salary.

00:37.200 --> 00:40.600
Of course $85,000 is the average salary in the United States.

00:40.650 --> 00:44.150
You obviously want to consider the cost of living in the areas that you're living in.

00:44.750 --> 00:48.500
The West Coast, San Francisco, Los Angeles would be slightly more expensive cost of living...

00:48.850 --> 00:51.850
...than Las Vegas, Nevada, or places like that.

00:51.900 --> 00:55.400
So it's an average number to keep in mind when you're job hunting.
