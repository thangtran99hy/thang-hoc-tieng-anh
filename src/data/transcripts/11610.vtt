00:00.160 --> 00:02.000
And you were also on a Korean television show...

00:02.100 --> 00:05.500
...and became like the most popular watched television show in the history of the show.

00:06.600 --> 00:12.170
That was my first international TV appearance, that Korean talent show called Star King...

00:12.580 --> 00:15.410
...and it was like almost three years ago...

00:16.280 --> 00:17.710
...like a long time ago, yeah.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.320
So, I've been on the show two times.

00:21.120 --> 00:25.690
The first time I was there, it was really amazing, the crowd was amazing. Koreans, I love them.

00:26.120 --> 00:31.830
And I was just so shocked when I found out that they were inviting me again...

00:32.160 --> 00:37.200
...because all the Koreans were like, talking about me. I was on the news all the time and...

00:38.000 --> 00:39.900
...I just love them. I wanna go back there.

00:40.270 --> 00:45.010
It must make you feel good inside when you go to a country that doesn't speak English...

00:45.240 --> 00:48.400
...and yet they know your songs, they know who you are, they come and they support you.

00:48.500 --> 00:49.400
It must be a great feeling.

00:49.500 --> 00:54.950
I think the most memorable part when I was in Korea, when they called me by my last name.

00:55.550 --> 00:57.990
They thought that my last name is my first name.

00:58.320 --> 01:02.760
They were like, Pempengco, Pempengco. I was in the restroom.

01:03.630 --> 01:06.530
When I went out, they were like, Pempengco! And I was like, huh?

01:06.760 --> 01:09.530
They were like, Pempengco, Pempengco! They were like all waiting for me...

01:09.630 --> 01:13.700
...but, they're calling my name, Pempengco. They thought that, that was my first name.

01:14.170 --> 01:16.200
It's really, really funny and amazing.
