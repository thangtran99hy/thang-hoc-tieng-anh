Jay had originally been asked by MTV to do this mashup thing.

00:04.030 --> 00:06.000
And they said, you know, "Who do you wanna do this thing with?"

00:06.470 --> 00:07.370
He said, "Linkin Park".

00:07.700 --> 00:11.740
And I sent him "Numb / Encore" which ended up being a single in one of them.

00:11.870 --> 00:15.010
From there we just kinda realized that we see eye to eye on a lot of stuff.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.210
I asked him to be my executive producer on it.

00:17.750 --> 00:21.800
And he agreed to do that so it kinda became a real album at that point.

00:22.080 --> 00:25.050
I tend to be all over the place, like I can do a lot of different things.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.020
I'm versatile when it comes to the studio.

00:27.490 --> 00:29.690
And I wanted somebody who can look over my shoulder and say,...

00:29.860 --> 00:31.960
...you know, "Keep that song, don't keep that song,"...

00:32.230 --> 00:34.200
...and "Keep working on this one, it's not done yet".

00:34.460 --> 00:40.000
What he did do was tell me when I was really on task,...

00:40.100 --> 00:43.184
...when I was making songs that were right for the album.
