00:07.240 --> 00:09.800
Put all your experience playing video games to work.

00:12.010 --> 00:12.570
Literally.

00:13.510 --> 00:17.850
You will need video game expertise, writing skills, and dedication.

00:18.980 --> 00:21.450
Optional: A degree in computer science.

00:22.280 --> 00:24.490
Step one: Enter online tournaments...

00:24.900 --> 00:26.320
...where you challenge other gamers for money.

00:26.590 --> 00:29.890
If you're good, you can win your way to a spot in one of the professional tournaments...

00:30.300 --> 00:33.330
...which pay big bucks. We're talking five and six figures.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.700
Step two: Apply to work in customer service for a video game company...

00:37.930 --> 00:42.740
...like starting in the mail room. An entry-level job like this could lead to a game - playing position.

00:43.840 --> 00:47.740
Step three: Apply for a job as a video game tester with a manufacturer.

00:48.180 --> 00:51.110
You'll need to be familiar with many different games and consoles,...

00:51.500 --> 00:54.880
...and demonstrate you can clearly articulate your likes and dislikes.

00:55.780 --> 01:01.090
Practice. Professional gamers play between 6 and 12 hours a day every day.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.230
Step four: Write about video games for a living...

01:04.490 --> 01:08.830
...either by becoming a game reviewer or working for a publisher that prepares game guides.

01:09.820 --> 01:12.700
Step five: Become a gameplay expert.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.740
These are people hired by game manufacturers to go around the country demonstrating new games.

01:18.310 --> 01:21.140
Step six: Become a software developer.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.950
In other words, create your own games.

01:24.580 --> 01:29.650
A degree in computer science can help you land a job in game writing, designing, and programming.

01:30.600 --> 01:34.520
Step seven: Whichever video game job you want, work hard.

01:34.990 --> 01:38.480
As you might imagine, the competition for these positions is intense.

01:39.130 --> 01:42.960
Did you know 72 percent of Americans play video games?
