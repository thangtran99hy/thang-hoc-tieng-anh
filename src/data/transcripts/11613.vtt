00:03.050 --> 00:05.500
All right everyone, here's today's Final Jeopardy clue.

00:06.850 --> 00:14.100
IBM is developing a computer system personified by this name to compete on Jeopardy.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.500
Elementary? I think not.

00:16.550 --> 00:17.950
It's a very difficult task.

00:18.250 --> 00:21.050
But the correct response, in a sense, is elementary.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.550
What is Watson?

00:24.200 --> 00:28.000
Only IBM can bring together the skills and the investment capability...

00:28.100 --> 00:30.300
...to take on a grand challenge of this size.

00:30.450 --> 00:33.650
Watson is a computer system that we have been putting together...

00:33.750 --> 00:37.750
...that is going to advance the state-of-the-art in automatic question answering.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
It requires critical thinking.

00:41.300 --> 00:44.300
It requires a whole lot more than knowledge alone.

00:44.700 --> 00:46.650
So, when people hear about this project and they say,...

00:46.700 --> 00:50.200
..."Well, isn't this just sort of Google on steroids?"

00:50.700 --> 00:51.500
No, it is not.

00:51.600 --> 00:57.100
It's always been a challenge to create computers that can actually communicate with...

00:57.300 --> 01:01.400
...and operate at anything like the level of a human mind.

01:01.550 --> 01:06.000
Under the hood in Watson is a natural language processing technology...

01:06.400 --> 01:08.100
...that's going to help advance the field.

01:08.400 --> 01:11.400
And Jeopardy is a great showcase for that kind of technology...

01:11.500 --> 01:17.050
...because what Jeopardy requires is that the computer competes with some of the best humans in the world.

01:17.100 --> 01:20.700
Minds that can very rapidly access a huge breadth of knowledge,...

01:20.950 --> 01:24.750
...deliver precise answers upwards of 85 or 90% precision,...

01:25.150 --> 01:27.200
...and deliver that with really great confidence.

01:27.550 --> 01:33.900
It will represent an entirely new level of communication between computers and human beings.

01:34.100 --> 01:38.800
The challenge it presents to Watson is to really drive the underlying technology to new heights:...

01:38.850 --> 01:42.100
...the precision, accuracy, confidence, and speed.

01:42.400 --> 01:47.950
I think Jeopardy is really the gold standard for IBM to use to test this kind of computer system.

01:48.050 --> 01:49.750
It's going to have to know what it knows.

01:50.050 --> 01:53.750
It's going to have to very rapidly compute a confidence that it's correct...

01:54.000 --> 01:58.050
...so that it buzzes in in time and can get the questions it believes it knows.

01:58.300 --> 02:02.700
Our entire creative team; producers, writers, researchers,...

02:03.200 --> 02:07.900
...are really excited with the challenge of writing material for this project.

02:08.450 --> 02:15.300
What we're doing is creating here a system that will be able to be applied to all sorts of applications in the world.

02:15.650 --> 02:19.950
And essentially cut the time to find answers to very difficult problems.

02:20.150 --> 02:24.750
It's a big challenge for IBM but I have a feeling they're up to the task.
