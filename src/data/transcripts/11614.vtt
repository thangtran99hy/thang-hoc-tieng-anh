A video that shows a group of men robbing a jewelry store in the town of Northampton, England yesterday.

00:06.095 --> 00:07.289
And who foiled them?

00:07.615 --> 00:10.522
A grandmother with a sense of justice and a handbag.

00:10.598 --> 00:12.344
Nick Watt tells us what happened.

00:14.003 --> 00:17.049
A brazen smash and grab in full swing.

00:17.311 --> 00:19.785
Look at that guy walking past like there's nothing happening.

00:20.036 --> 00:22.764
They're trying to steal watches from a store window.

00:23.022 --> 00:25.851
Then out of nowhere, a galloping grandma.

00:26.135 --> 00:29.095
Armed with a handbag and a whole lot of chutzpah.

00:29.381 --> 00:32.106
Bang, bang, bang.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.327
She is Ann Timson.

00:33.463 --> 00:34.792
She's in her 70s.

00:34.999 --> 00:37.537
And now she's hailed as "supergran".

00:37.897 --> 00:41.199
Like any good superhero, she is shunning the limelight.

00:41.537 --> 00:44.769
"I just wanna be left in peace," she told her local newspaper.

00:45.017 --> 00:45.733
Let's see it again.

00:46.734 --> 00:47.382
Here she comes.

00:47.591 --> 00:50.417
"I don't know what happened next," supergran told the paper,...

00:50.542 --> 00:52.158
"I just kept swinging."

00:52.493 --> 00:54.167
She's got groceries in that handbag.

00:54.259 --> 00:57.042
She's like a boxer with a horseshoe in his glove.

00:57.286 --> 01:02.066
"I landed several blows against one lad," said our heroine, "and brought him to the ground."

01:02.559 --> 01:04.057
Not one of them hit her back.

01:04.194 --> 01:07.333
Why? Their mothers taught them to respect their elders?

01:07.886 --> 01:12.664
Truth is in Britain, we revere old ladies particularly those with handbags.

01:12.779 --> 01:15.711
And another just joined that pantheon.

01:15.839 --> 01:18.279
"Good on ya supergran," reads one web post.

01:18.469 --> 01:21.013
"If I knew who you were, I'd buy you a drink."

01:21.345 --> 01:23.867
"Supergran, I'd buy you dinner."

01:24.138 --> 01:25.875
