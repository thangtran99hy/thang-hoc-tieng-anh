My name is Josh Wiseman, I've been at Facebook for two years now.

00:06.753 --> 00:08.983
Photos is my favorite application on the site.

00:09.111 --> 00:10.924
It's, by far, the most popular application.

00:11.065 --> 00:13.381
We didn't necessarily expect it be as huge as it was.

00:13.506 --> 00:14.449
But as soon as we launched it...

00:14.520 --> 00:16.827
...and we started to see that growth curve, it was pretty clear that...

00:17.015 --> 00:19.965
...we were soon gonna overtake everyone as far as photo sharing on the Internet.

00:20.413 --> 00:24.221
We're receiving almost 2,000 photo uploads per second.

00:24.720 --> 00:28.188
We get 40 million photos uploaded every single day.

00:28.675 --> 00:30.057
So, that's well over a billion a month.

00:30.736 --> 00:33.931
Storing 40 billion files is a pretty daunting task.

00:34.159 --> 00:38.432
As with any of these kinds of systems, they are simple in very small scale.

00:38.735 --> 00:40.984
They get infinitely complex in large scale.

00:41.411 --> 00:45.719
I get the most satisfaction just from seeing how much my friends and family have started to use it.

00:46.561 --> 00:48.442
We're allowing people to share this information...

00:48.565 --> 00:50.760
...and these experiences that they couldn't share before,...

00:51.956 --> 00:55.383
...you know, photos of their friends having fun, taking them with like a cellphone camera...

00:55.586 --> 00:59.047
That's something that really, there was no great way to do it before Facebook.

01:00.260 --> 01:03.415
There's a huge amount of room for engineers to come in and...

01:03.903 --> 01:06.677
...not just help out on some of these projects, but start these projects...

01:07.390 --> 01:10.507
...and brainstorm new ones, and I think Photos is a really good example.

01:11.954 --> 01:14.451
It was started by one person a few years ago and...

01:15.087 --> 01:16.759
...a few of us have dabbled in it since then.

01:17.414 --> 01:19.705
With a team of three or four people which sounds...

01:20.219 --> 01:24.127
...pretty small by industry standards, we could accomplish so much more with Facebook Photos.

01:24.531 --> 01:27.351
There's just much more room for the engineering department to grow.
