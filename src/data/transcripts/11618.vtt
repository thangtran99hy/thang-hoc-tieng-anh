00:00.800 --> 00:07.400
All right, now we are going to talk about introductions, meeting new people.

00:08.300 --> 00:13.000
One of the first things that you want to make sure happens in an introduction,...

00:13.100 --> 00:17.000
...and we're going to talk about several things that are real important to introductions,...

00:17.350 --> 00:18.900
...but one of the most important,...

00:19.750 --> 00:22.100
...we've been talking about it, is smiling.

00:22.600 --> 00:26.950
When you are introduced to people or even when you introduce people,...

00:27.300 --> 00:29.200
...you want to make sure and smile.

00:29.600 --> 00:30.800
You know, you might be nervous.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.300
You might be a little uncomfortable,...

00:32.400 --> 00:37.200
...but again smile because what this shows is that you are open,...

00:37.600 --> 00:39.200
...that you are positive,...

00:39.350 --> 00:41.300
...that you are approachable,...

00:41.800 --> 00:43.500
...that you are sincere.

00:44.200 --> 00:48.400
It shows off lots and lots of positive qualities about you...

00:48.800 --> 00:53.050
...that will make the person that's meeting you feel good about you,...

00:53.510 --> 00:58.700
...and feel comfortable with you rather than if you didn't smile at all.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.850
If you don't smile when you're meeting new people,...

01:00.950 --> 01:03.400
...that gives very negative information,...

01:03.800 --> 01:08.650
...so make sure, when you are meeting people for the first time, that you smile.
