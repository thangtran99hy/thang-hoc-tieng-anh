Would you please hold me?

00:04.885 --> 00:07.675
In "Love Story," the 1970 tearjerker,...

00:08.163 --> 00:13.403
...the couple is shattered, as Jennifer, Oliver's wife, loses her battle to cancer.

00:14.172 --> 00:19.270
Oliver along with millions of viewers the world over were left to mourn.

00:29.678 --> 00:35.274
James Cameron's "Titanic" is more recent but still uses the classic formula:...

00:35.875 --> 00:40.469
...love unites, life separates, but love endures.

00:41.897 --> 00:43.873
We're gonna make it, Rose. Trust me.

00:44.432 --> 00:45.319
I trust you.

00:46.544 --> 00:50.647
The love story of Jack Dawson and his upper crust lover Rose...

00:51.073 --> 00:53.773
...is as short as the ocean liner's ill-fated trip.

00:55.987 --> 01:00.624
Rose survives, and with her, so does her love for Jack.

01:04.937 --> 01:09.883
The film garnered 11 Academy Awards and broke the box office record of all time,...

01:10.271 --> 01:11.539
...at least until "Avatar".

01:12.263 --> 01:16.405
It also made Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet superstars.

01:19.705 --> 01:25.663
But "Titanic" aside, young people today seem to prefer more realistic on-screen romances,...

01:25.947 --> 01:27.021
...like this young lady.

01:27.293 --> 01:29.573
I think the younger generation is a little bit more cynical.

01:30.122 --> 01:33.391
And I think there's a little less loyalty in general.

01:37.833 --> 01:41.729
Regardless of age, few can resist true love...

01:41.987 --> 01:47.405
...when they find it, even if it's just for a couple of hours inside a dark theater.
