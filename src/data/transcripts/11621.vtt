00:00.300 --> 00:04.530
But also I was having fun. So, I called it "blast" because everyone's having fun.

00:04.630 --> 00:05.070
Have fun.

00:05.300 --> 00:08.970
So, blast means having a blast. It's having fun.

00:09.170 --> 00:09.740
I see.

00:10.070 --> 00:13.070
So it's blast, and then beat is the music obviously.

00:14.110 --> 00:15.510
So, it's having fun with music.

00:15.780 --> 00:18.410
Uh-huh. So, it's not spreading like a business...

00:18.510 --> 00:21.520
Yeah, exactly. It's about putting fun back into learning.

00:21.750 --> 00:22.100
Uh-huh.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.850
Putting fun back into education.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.190
Into education.

00:25.450 --> 00:27.920
And I suppose that's the problem in Japan.

00:29.060 --> 00:31.930
And internationally, there's a problem with education.

00:32.030 --> 00:32.490
Yes.

00:32.560 --> 00:37.030
First off, the education system was designed for the Industrial Age.

00:38.300 --> 00:39.170
For the Industrial Age?

00:39.330 --> 00:43.410
Yeah, the system we have now was designed for the Industrial Age.

00:44.240 --> 00:45.910
But, we are living at the information age.

00:49.310 --> 00:50.780
Yeah, it's not good anymore.

00:53.820 --> 00:57.190
What do you think we need to change? What part?

00:57.820 --> 01:03.430
I think we need to fundamentally change the education system from the very base, I mean.

01:09.460 --> 01:13.130
If you want young people to learn, you give them a hunger for learning.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.940
Right? That's what we need to do. The hunger.

01:17.140 --> 01:21.040
So, what gives people a hunger? It's because they want it.

01:21.240 --> 01:25.250
Because it's a pleasurable experience, because it's an interesting experience,...

01:25.350 --> 01:28.380
...because they feel that it's relevant to them.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.950
But none of them is happening in the education system now.

01:32.750 --> 01:36.860
I see you're told that, you know, "You got to get so many points to"...

01:37.090 --> 01:37.530
Test?

01:37.930 --> 01:40.500
..."test, test, test. It's all stress, stress, stress."

01:40.650 --> 01:40.900
Uh-huh.

01:41.060 --> 01:44.870
We're ruining young people's lives, you know? With all this stress right?

01:46.500 --> 01:48.540
Some of them are dropping out now.

01:48.975 --> 01:53.840
In the United States and in parts of England, you know, the dropout rate is 50%.

01:55.010 --> 01:59.310
Alright. It's a huge problem, right? So, you know, in Japan it's less...

01:59.780 --> 02:03.150
...on the surface, but underneath I'm sure it's quite big as well.

02:03.690 --> 02:08.590
'Cause there's a lot of people that just don't get this, that don't want it.

02:09.220 --> 02:11.660
So, good people are being lost...

02:12.060 --> 02:16.430
...because the system, it's faulty. The system is out-of-date.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.070
It was designed 100 years ago for the Industrial Age.
