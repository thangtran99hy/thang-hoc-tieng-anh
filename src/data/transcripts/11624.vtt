00:05.500 --> 00:07.317
We had a very simple focus, an idea.

00:07.467 --> 00:09.450
The goal wasn't to make a huge community site,...

00:09.900 --> 00:13.983
...it's to make something where you could type in someone's name and find out a bunch of information about them.

00:15.700 --> 00:17.087
I don't know, I took a few days,...

00:17.173 --> 00:20.383
...and just threw together Facebook and launched it on February 4th, 2004.

00:20.633 --> 00:22.017
It was just me working on it that time.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.972
But at that point, my roommate Dustin,...

00:24.409 --> 00:27.250
...who hadn't had much computer programming experience at all was like,...

00:27.733 --> 00:28.650
..."You know, I can help you expand."

00:28.731 --> 00:31.017
Then I'm like, "That's cool dude, but you don't know how to program."

00:32.567 --> 00:34.217
So, he's like, "No, no, it's not an issue."

00:34.300 --> 00:37.417
And he went home one weekend, bought the book Perl for Dummies,...

00:37.700 --> 00:38.983
..came back and was like, "Alright, I'm ready."

00:39.233 --> 00:43.217
And then we started getting emails from people at a bunch of other schools asking if we can launch Facebooks there.

00:43.733 --> 00:48.783
In the last tech bubble, most websites were run using these really expensive machines...

00:48.967 --> 00:53.550
...which made it that you had to basically go and raise money before you can do anything.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.183
We ran the site originally for $85 a month,...

00:56.367 --> 00:58.283
...renting computers for the first three months.

00:58.400 --> 00:59.050
Were you ever in debt?

01:00.500 --> 01:04.383
I mean I was in debt $160, you know.

01:11.700 --> 01:13.117
There are big sites on the internet.

01:13.467 --> 01:15.983
They're like, "15% of our users come back monthly."

01:16.100 --> 01:19.050
And we're like, "Alright, that's cool. Like 70% of our users come back every day."

01:20.467 --> 01:23.117
I think I have like, 15,000 pending friend requests.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.517
And whenever I open up that page, the site crashes.

01:26.033 --> 01:27.267
So, I gave up on that.

01:27.900 --> 01:29.883
Do you feel trapped or liberated in today's technology?

01:30.267 --> 01:30.750
I don't know.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.683
I guess it's a little bit of both.

01:32.833 --> 01:34.583
I mean, I spend a lot of my time at the office.

01:34.667 --> 01:37.850
And then, I have a studio apartment a couple of blocks away,...

01:38.233 --> 01:43.050
...where it's just my bed, and like, a table and a chair and a teapot.

01:43.167 --> 01:45.917
And I don't even have internet access at my apartment,...

01:46.033 --> 01:48.483
...so I don't know, I'm pretty like, isolated from wherever I need to be.

01:48.767 --> 01:51.483
Either that or the fact that I'm too lazy to get internet access.
