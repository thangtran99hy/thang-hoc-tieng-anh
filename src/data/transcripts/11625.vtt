00:06.341 --> 00:09.313
The Internet, as we know it today, is an outstanding success.

00:09.604 --> 00:13.347
More than 1.3 billion people are connected to the Web across the globe.

00:13.921 --> 00:17.155
The development is driven by users as well as by technology.

00:17.280 --> 00:21.511
Whilst the number of users and the amount of content is growing faster and faster,...

00:21.627 --> 00:23.850
...the Internet is departing from computers.

00:24.076 --> 00:28.725
More than 1 billion users of mobile phones already have the opportunity to access the Internet.

00:29.057 --> 00:31.895
Consumers will depend entirely upon network services...

00:32.082 --> 00:36.197
...and businesses will depend entirely upon the future Internet to provide these services.

00:36.498 --> 00:40.738
But since the current Internet consists of mostly unstructured data and resources,...

00:40.921 --> 00:44.227
...most of the data and resources are unusable for the average user.

00:44.565 --> 00:48.093
Fact is, the Internet is broken. We still have not one Web,...

00:48.487 --> 00:52.763
...but a vast variety of different unlinked data that is unable to communicate.

00:53.171 --> 00:56.989
That's why future Internet will have to change, and change it will.

00:57.181 --> 01:00.056
We are currently rethinking the Web on various levels.

01:00.221 --> 01:02.043
We are preparing for a web of things.

01:02.271 --> 01:06.206
All electronic devices will be active participants in the future Internet.

01:06.655 --> 01:08.859
Everything and everybody will be connected.

01:09.061 --> 01:13.607
The future Internet will also reorganize publicity, privacy and anonymity....

01:13.833 --> 01:18.103
...where everybody can understand how much trust can and should be extended to others.

01:18.880 --> 01:21.367
Everything, everywhere, always.

01:21.783 --> 01:24.381
We must imagine future Internet as a service.

01:24.645 --> 01:29.597
Mobile, ubiquitous and pervasive. Twenty-four seven availability will be the norm.

01:29.866 --> 01:33.883
To sustain the demands of the future Internet, networks must be re-engineered.

01:34.129 --> 01:37.185
We need new networks which integrate all kinds of devices...

01:37.364 --> 01:40.224
...and which allow the most auspicious vision of future Internet.

01:40.523 --> 01:45.233
The Internet of services will bring an enormous increase in the efficiency of economic processes.

01:45.444 --> 01:49.567
Business processes are unified in services that can be used by different groups of people.

01:49.759 --> 01:53.814
Within a company or enterprise or externally, via the Internet of services.

01:53.989 --> 01:58.819
Soon, redundantly providing the same information again and again will no longer be necessary.

01:59.079 --> 02:03.579
Semantics will provide secure and efficient access to a coordinated set of services...

02:03.855 --> 02:07.133
...that are not location dependent, are interoperable, coherent,...

02:07.368 --> 02:10.541
...consistent, scalable, pervasive, and reliable.

02:10.786 --> 02:14.027
These services will be networked together through the future Internet.
