Today, even with the most advanced advertising systems that exist,...

00:04.041 --> 00:06.751
...they only have estimates of what someone's gender might be...

00:06.995 --> 00:09.554
...or what someone's age might be or what they might be interested in.

00:10.244 --> 00:12.635
But on Facebook, we know exactly what gender someone is.

00:12.853 --> 00:15.225
And exactly how old they are, and exactly what they're interested in.

00:15.664 --> 00:18.706
At a presentation to advertisers in 2007,...

00:18.980 --> 00:23.175
Mark Zuckerberg pitched the benefits of Facebook's vast database.

00:23.454 --> 00:24.663
When you run ads on Facebook,...

00:24.985 --> 00:27.240
...you're also gonna learn a lot about the audience that you're reaching.

00:27.787 --> 00:29.283
And a lot of this you're gonna be able to do directly...

00:29.436 --> 00:32.122
...to the messages that you send to them and the content that they upload.

00:32.444 --> 00:33.927
But the rest, we're gonna do...

00:34.207 --> 00:38.465
...by aggregating nonpersonal identifiable information about the users that you're reaching.

00:39.331 --> 00:42.582
Facebook's lifeblood and the heart of its revenue model...

00:42.865 --> 00:48.372
...is the accumulation of data its users volunteer, including their interests or likes.

00:49.004 --> 00:51.728
Advertisers, who helped boost Facebook's revenue...

00:51.815 --> 00:55.294
...to an estimated 1.4 billion dollars in 2010,...

00:55.735 --> 00:59.950
...buy access to that gold mine of anonymous demographic information,...

01:00.477 --> 01:04.867
...enabling them to reach a remarkably specific and well targeted audience.
