00:07.070 --> 00:08.100
And you know what scares me?

00:08.670 --> 00:10.070
Being in an airplane.

00:10.240 --> 00:12.600
It's weird, yeah. You're basically in a metal tube.

00:12.700 --> 00:13.840
Or essentially in a flying chair.

00:13.940 --> 00:16.480
Do we need to talk about this before we get on a 12 - hour flight?

00:22.620 --> 00:23.020
Heroes.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.090
My father is my hero.

00:24.420 --> 00:27.160
In terms of career and someone I admire,...

00:27.620 --> 00:32.130
...a hero of mine is Rachel McAdams. I really hope to follow in her footsteps.

00:32.230 --> 00:33.600
People who are truly my heroes...

00:33.700 --> 00:38.530
...are people who are in third world countries fighting tooth and nail to simply survive.

00:38.630 --> 00:40.300
These are the people who are your heroes.
