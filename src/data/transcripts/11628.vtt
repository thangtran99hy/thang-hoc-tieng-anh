Do you feel like it's a backlash or do you feel like you're violating people's privacy?

00:04.100 --> 00:06.600
Do you feel like you're adequately portrayed?

00:07.850 --> 00:10.750
'Cause I wanna wonder about the person who actually created this thing.

00:11.500 --> 00:15.900
Yeah, I mean a lot of stuff happened along the way.

00:15.950 --> 00:26.200
I think, you know, there were real learning points and turning points along the way in terms of building things.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.450
You know, it really went from this position very early on where we were just in this college dorm room...

00:33.800 --> 00:36.300
...to we moved out to California. It was a few friends and me.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.950
And, you know, it just kind of had this project feel for a while...

00:42.000 --> 00:48.350
...and there was this real turning point when companies started trying to buy the company for a huge amount of money.

00:48.450 --> 00:50.450
And, you know, I tell you, kinda get my friends together...

00:50.500 --> 00:54.700
...and we had to decide what was it that we really cared about and what was it that we wanted to do.

00:55.500 --> 00:57.900
And, you know, we decided not to take those offers.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.200
And to me, a lot of that decision was that,...

01:01.550 --> 01:05.100
...what we wanted to do and what we wanted to spend, you know, a big part of our lives doing...

01:05.450 --> 01:11.350
...was just continuing to push and kind of build products that help people share information,...

01:11.950 --> 01:13.900
...build products that help people stay connected.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.500
And that's really what we're spending our time doing.

01:16.700 --> 01:22.550
And, you know, I think there's just been a lot of space between that early stuff and where we are now.

01:23.950 --> 01:28.150
If I knew what I knew now then, then I hope I wouldn't have made those mistakes.

01:28.200 --> 01:30.850
But I can't go back and change the past.

01:30.950 --> 01:33.300
I can only do what we think is the right thing going forward.
