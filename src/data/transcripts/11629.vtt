Hi, I'm Roz Usheroff, an image and communications specialist.

00:18.967 --> 00:23.017
People say that the impression clock starts ticking with a handshake.

00:23.533 --> 00:28.617
And I'm here today to show you how to wow people with a powerful handshake.

00:29.033 --> 00:31.850
That is when the first impression begins to count.

00:32.833 --> 00:35.250
I'd like to introduce you to my friend, David Coates.

00:36.167 --> 00:37.083
Pleased to meet you, Roz.

00:37.500 --> 00:38.583
Hi, David. How are you?

00:38.733 --> 00:39.250
I'm fine.

00:40.167 --> 00:44.650
I'm gonna teach David some ideas about how we can have a more impactful handshake.

00:45.400 --> 00:50.117
As we go through the different steps, think about what's your handshake saying about you.

00:51.333 --> 00:52.893
So David, when you shake hands,...

00:52.989 --> 00:56.383
...what I'd like you to think about is not to drop the hand too quickly.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.925
So when you put your hand out,...

00:59.140 --> 01:03.017
...I want you to imagine it's going straight out like this two to three times,...

01:03.333 --> 01:06.783
...and hold for the length of time it takes to learn the color of my eyes.

01:07.633 --> 01:12.483
The key here is, if you think about that time frame, from learning the color of their eyes,...

01:12.767 --> 01:15.383
...it will make your handshake appear a lot more sincere.

01:16.633 --> 01:21.417
Another thing, David, is what you don't want to do is flip the person over like this.

01:22.017 --> 01:26.700
This kind of handshake looks like it's controlling and you're putting the person on the bottom.

01:27.866 --> 01:32.650
Another handshake that you don't want to do is when you take them in a double hand clasp.

01:33.267 --> 01:37.883
Unless you know someone very well, that may be a little bit too personal or invasive.

01:38.733 --> 01:41.983
Then you have this kind of handshake, which is the fingertip.

01:42.367 --> 01:46.250
This will show absolutely no confidence in your handshake.

01:47.400 --> 01:52.317
Another idea that you don't want to do is grasping the person's hand all the way up.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.250
When you move your hand up their hand,...

01:55.867 --> 01:57.840
...again, that may give off the impression...

01:57.927 --> 02:01.783
...that you're trying to take control of the whole meeting that you have.

02:03.067 --> 02:04.510
David, as we shake hands...

02:04.579 --> 02:08.750
...we hold on for the length of time it takes to learn the color of their eyes. 

02:09.433 --> 02:13.550
As well, what you want to do is make sure that you use the person's name.

02:13.800 --> 02:18.150
The key about a handshake is you introduce yourself, repeat back their name...

02:18.533 --> 02:19.883
...it helps you to remember it.

02:20.283 --> 02:23.917
You repeat it back at the beginning of the handshake and at the end of the handshake.

02:24.833 --> 02:26.217
Thank you so much, David.

02:26.767 --> 02:28.017
Thank you Roz, it's a pleasure.

02:28.300 --> 02:29.117
Pleasure meeting you.

02:30.300 --> 02:32.817
As you can see, he held on for that second longer.

02:33.267 --> 02:38.150
We now have impact in the first impression and a handshake that was most memorable.
