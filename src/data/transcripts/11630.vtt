Google Insights for Search is a powerful tool...

00:07.550 --> 00:11.200
...to help you analyze the impact of your marketing activities on search interest.

00:12.250 --> 00:16.000
Brand name searches are great indicators of people's ability to recall your brand.

00:16.750 --> 00:21.000
Imagine if you're able to see how searches for your brand changed after running a campaign.

00:21.600 --> 00:25.050
You'd be able to show the impact of your marketing activities on online search...

00:25.350 --> 00:27.650
...and perhaps make a better case for budget in the future.

00:28.450 --> 00:30.600
Here's how to do it with Google Insights for Search.

00:31.150 --> 00:35.100
Let's take the example of Nike's 2006 FIFA World Cup Campaign.

00:35.400 --> 00:39.250
"Joga Bonito" was a highly integrated marketing campaign across media...

00:39.600 --> 00:41.700
...and included a number of television commercials.

00:42.150 --> 00:47.100
Let's look up searches for the campaign, "Joga Bonito" just before and after the World Cup.

00:47.550 --> 00:51.850
Notice how there was an obvious increase in interest levels during the time the campaign ran.

00:54.500 --> 00:58.450
It's apparent that this campaign was effective in triggering more online searches for this term.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.900
Now, let's look at the top related and rising search terms.

01:04.800 --> 01:10.400
Nike's brand tops the list which means that brand association and recall were very high for this particular campaign.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.500
If you're running an integrated marketing campaign like Nike,...

01:14.950 --> 01:18.300
...you can see how effective the campaign was in driving online search interest...

01:18.650 --> 01:21.100
...and how strongly associated it was to the Nike brand.

01:22.650 --> 01:23.850
With Google Insights for Search,...

01:24.150 --> 01:28.250
...you can measure the impact of your marketing activities both offline and online...

01:28.650 --> 01:31.150
...by people's ability to recall and search for your brand.
