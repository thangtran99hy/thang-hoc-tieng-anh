00:03.200 --> 00:05.800
After breakfast, the two boys and Fagin played a game.

00:06.450 --> 00:07.700
Fagin walked around the room.

00:08.400 --> 00:09.900
He pretended he was in the street.

00:10.650 --> 00:13.400
The two boys tried to take things from his pockets.

00:13.950 --> 00:16.300
If Fagin felt them doing it, he would shout.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.250
They played this game for a while.

00:19.150 --> 00:22.200
Fagin asked Oliver to try and take a wallet from his coat pocket.

00:22.800 --> 00:25.100
Oliver copied what the Artful Dodger did.

00:25.750 --> 00:29.300
He told Oliver to always do what the Artful Dodger told him to do,...

00:29.750 --> 00:31.700
...and one day he would be a great man.

00:32.650 --> 00:36.700
Oliver asked to go out with the boys, and one day, at last, Fagin agreed.

00:37.250 --> 00:40.100
They walked along the streets, but the boys did not hurry.

00:40.650 --> 00:42.750
Oliver was surprised when he saw Charley Bates...

00:43.100 --> 00:47.150
...take apples and oranges from the shops along the way and put them into his pockets.

00:47.700 --> 00:49.300
He seemed to have a lot of pockets.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.800
Oliver didn't like it and was about to go back to Fagin...

00:53.100 --> 00:56.900
...when the Artful Dodger suddenly stopped and put his finger in front of his mouth.

00:57.800 --> 01:01.650
"Can you see that old man at the bookshop?" asked the Artful Dodger.

01:02.300 --> 01:05.600
Oliver saw an elderly gentleman standing outside the bookshop.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.300
"He'll do," said the Artful Dodger.

01:09.050 --> 01:12.500
Charley Bates agreed and the two boys began to walk toward the man.

01:13.100 --> 01:14.500
Oliver walked behind them.

01:15.150 --> 01:16.250
He didn't know what to do.

01:17.050 --> 01:20.250
Then he saw the Artful Dodger put his hand in the gentleman's pocket,...

01:20.550 --> 01:23.300
...take out a handkerchief, and give it to Charley Bates.

01:23.900 --> 01:26.750
The two boys ran around the corner as quickly as they could.

01:27.450 --> 01:29.400
Suddenly, Oliver understood everything.
