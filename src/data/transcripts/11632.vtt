00:03.350 --> 00:05.500
This is the story of four sisters.

00:05.750 --> 00:08.500
They lived in Boston in America during the Civil War.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
Their father was away helping the army,...

00:11.150 --> 00:14.450
...so they lived in the house with their mother and Hannah, their servant.

00:15.100 --> 00:16.300
Margaret was the oldest.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.650
She was sixteen and was very pretty.

00:19.150 --> 00:20.150
She had blond hair.

00:20.700 --> 00:22.000
Her family called her Meg.

00:22.700 --> 00:24.100
Next came Josephine.

00:24.350 --> 00:27.050
She was a tall fifteen-year-old with long legs.

00:27.450 --> 00:28.950
She wished that she were a boy.

00:29.450 --> 00:30.800
Her family called her Jo.

00:31.550 --> 00:33.100
The third sister was Elizabeth.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.400
She was thirteen.

00:34.700 --> 00:36.850
She was a very quiet, shy girl.

00:37.150 --> 00:38.750
Her family called her Beth.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.950
The youngest sister was Amy.

00:41.350 --> 00:43.200
She was thin and had blue eyes.

00:43.700 --> 00:47.000
She thought she was very important and behaved like a lady.

00:47.800 --> 00:52.300
Their mother was Mrs. March, and they all loved her very much and tried to please her.

00:52.750 --> 00:55.650
She worked hard to help the army by making clothes.

00:56.350 --> 00:57.850
The girls called her Marmee.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.300
The March family did not have much money.

01:01.950 --> 01:06.350
They still had their house and Hannah to help them, but their clothes were old,...

01:06.600 --> 01:09.050
...and sometimes they did not have enough to eat.

01:09.650 --> 01:14.750
Life was sometimes difficult, but they always tried to be happy and help each other.
