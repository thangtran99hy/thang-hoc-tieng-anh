00:04.200 --> 00:06.400
"I don't know. The world is a big place."

00:07.000 --> 00:09.650
"It used to be a big place," said Phileas Fogg.

00:09.900 --> 00:13.300
"It's a lot smaller now," the bank director agreed.

00:13.800 --> 00:19.550
"It is smaller because now you can travel around it ten times more quickly than you could one hundred years ago."

00:20.250 --> 00:21.900
"You can do it in eighty days."

00:22.100 --> 00:25.400
"I read it in the newspaper," said one of the other players.

00:26.100 --> 00:31.000
"But there could be bad weather, shipwrecks, and many other problems that delay the trip."

00:31.500 --> 00:33.800
"It might be eighty days on the timetables...

00:34.050 --> 00:36.050
...but I don't think it will work if you try it."

00:36.700 --> 00:39.200
"I'm sure it will," replied Phileas Fogg.

00:39.850 --> 00:41.100
"I'd like to see you prove it."

00:41.450 --> 00:44.400
"I bet 4,000 pounds that you can't do it!"

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Each of the five players said that they would bet the same amount.

00:48.700 --> 00:51.050
"I'll do it," said Mr. Fogg calmly.

00:51.450 --> 00:54.000
"I have 20,000 pounds with Baring Brothers."

00:54.250 --> 00:55.400
"I am ready to risk it."

00:55.800 --> 00:57.150
They could hardly believe him.

00:57.550 --> 01:00.650
"You will lose all that money if there is an unexpected delay."

01:01.350 --> 01:04.700
"I do not believe in the unexpected," replied Mr. Fogg.

01:05.300 --> 01:06.050
"When will you go?"

01:06.900 --> 01:10.150
"Now. The train to Dover leaves at 8:45."

01:10.250 --> 01:11.100
"I will be on it."

01:11.800 --> 01:12.250
"Tonight?"

01:12.750 --> 01:13.700
"Yes, tonight."

01:14.450 --> 01:16.700
"It is Wednesday, the second of October,...

01:17.050 --> 01:22.350
...and I will be back in this room at 8:45 on Saturday, the 21st of December."

01:22.800 --> 01:29.000
"If I am not here, you may cash this check for 20,000 pounds and share the money among yourselves."

01:29.750 --> 01:33.150
The six men wrote it all down on a piece of paper and signed it.
