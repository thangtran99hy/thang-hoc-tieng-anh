00:02.230 --> 00:05.030
One day a friend of Mr. Murdstone's came to stay.

00:05.770 --> 00:11.470
His name was Mr. Quinion, and he had a bottle factory in London and offered me a job.

00:12.070 --> 00:16.850
"I'm sending you to do something useful," said Mr. Murdstone.

00:17.710 --> 00:20.050
The next day, neither sad nor happy,...

00:20.280 --> 00:23.820
...I left my little home on my way to the big world outside.

00:24.750 --> 00:26.890
I am not easily surprised nowadays,...

00:27.200 --> 00:31.860
...but it made me think about how I was sent away from school at the age of ten to work.

00:32.530 --> 00:35.730
I started my work at the factory of Murdstone and Grinby.

00:36.360 --> 00:40.300
On that first day, I met a man called Mr. Micawber.

00:41.140 --> 00:42.640
He became my landlord.

00:43.070 --> 00:46.980
He collected me from work and took me through the backstreets to his house.

00:47.710 --> 00:50.610
He introduced me to his wife and their four children:...

00:50.980 --> 00:55.780
...twins who were still nursing, a four-year-old boy, and a three-year-old girl.

00:56.380 --> 00:58.850
They were very poor and had many creditors.

00:59.290 --> 01:02.560
The creditors used to come knocking on the door very early,...

01:02.820 --> 01:06.590
...and they shouted at Mr. Micawber to come out. He never did.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.300
He used to say,...

01:08.960 --> 01:13.700
"If you earn twenty shillings a year and spend nineteen, you will be happy."

01:14.100 --> 01:19.070
"If you earn twenty shillings a year and spend twenty-one, you will be unhappy,"...

01:19.840 --> 01:21.910
...but he never followed these words.
