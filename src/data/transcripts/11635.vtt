The Moonstone was a large yellow diamond that was famous in the history of India.

00:07.400 --> 00:11.470
Three priests were given the job of watching the diamond day and night.

00:11.940 --> 00:15.680
When the priests grew old, they were replaced by other priests.

00:16.280 --> 00:17.810
Hundreds of years passed.

00:18.050 --> 00:21.980
Then, a Mogul emperor attacked the city and took the diamond.

00:22.450 --> 00:25.120
The three priests could not take it back by force,...

00:25.420 --> 00:29.390
...but they followed the diamond as it passed from one emperor to another.

00:30.330 --> 00:34.760
At last, the Sultan of Seringapatam put the diamond in the handle of a dagger...

00:35.130 --> 00:36.630
...and put it in his treasury.

00:37.370 --> 00:41.800
Then, in 1799, the British Army attacked Seringapatam.

00:42.370 --> 00:44.870
The soldiers heard stories about the yellow diamond,...

00:45.170 --> 00:49.410
...but the general of the army said, the soldiers were not to take any treasure.

00:49.880 --> 00:52.820
However, a greedy officer called Herncastle,...

00:53.220 --> 00:56.290
...killed the three Indian priests and took the diamond.

00:56.850 --> 01:01.590
The last of the priests to die told him that the diamond would bring him bad luck.
