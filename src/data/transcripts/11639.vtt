We've come to associate the celebration of St. Patrick's day with a lot of drinking.

00:07.450 --> 00:09.800
But in fact, there's more to it than just that.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.300
The holiday would not exist had it not been for a band of marauders,...

00:13.440 --> 00:18.610
...who, during the 5th century A.D., kidnapped a 16 - year - old Welsh boy by the name of Maewyn.

00:18.710 --> 00:21.680
During the six years that they held him captive as a slave,...

00:21.820 --> 00:23.420
...he came to a religious awakening.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.420
He changed his name to Patrick,...

00:25.590 --> 00:27.990
...joined a monastery, and took on a new calling:...

00:28.190 --> 00:30.590
...that of converting his people to Christianity.

00:30.730 --> 00:32.990
He did so by founding schools and churches.

00:33.160 --> 00:36.300
And within 200 years, Ireland was a Christian country.

00:36.560 --> 00:42.300
It's also said that he used the three - leaf clover as a tool to teach the people of the Holy Trinity.

00:42.450 --> 00:45.370
St. Patrick died in 461 A.D....

00:45.570 --> 00:48.910
...and the date of March 17th was declared a religious holiday.

00:49.010 --> 00:51.680
In Ireland, most businesses remain closed...

00:51.780 --> 00:53.820
...while pubs and restaurants are open.

00:54.020 --> 00:58.350
The St. Patrick's day custom spread throughout the world. So today, we're all Irish.

00:58.450 --> 00:59.620
Happy St. Patrick's day!
