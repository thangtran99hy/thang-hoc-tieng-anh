In what ways do you think Asian entertainers,...

00:08.023 --> 00:12.741
...whether they are musicians or actors, actresses; how can they influence the Western market...

00:12.889 --> 00:14.653
...which is clearly different from our own?

00:15.644 --> 00:19.885
You know, it doesn't really matter where they come from.

00:22.429 --> 00:27.426
The important thing is people should understand each other. Yeah.

00:29.359 --> 00:33.019
If you had the chance to introduce Korean culture to people overseas,..

00:33.326 --> 00:35.915
...which aspect would you like to introduce to them first?

00:36.865 --> 00:39.579
Okay, that's a good question.

00:40.715 --> 00:45.882
I love all Korean food you know, especially, do you know kimchi?

00:46.625 --> 00:49.136
Kimchi's perfect, you know, it's amazing.

00:49.657 --> 00:56.489
You should try it and I bet you're gonna like it. Yeah.

01:01.197 --> 01:01.899
Do you like kimchi?

01:02.128 --> 01:02.526
Yes, I do.

01:02.669 --> 01:04.663
Yeah, it's my favorite.

01:06.673 --> 01:09.585
What advice would you give to the young people who look up to you...

01:09.667 --> 01:10.789
...and who want to be like you?

01:14.708 --> 01:15.550
Just work hard.

01:15.986 --> 01:22.046
You know, that's how I did it. That's the way to get there. Yeah.
