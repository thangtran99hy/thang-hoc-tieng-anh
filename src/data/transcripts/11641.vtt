00:03.100 --> 00:04.300
Avengers assemble!

00:06.100 --> 00:07.500
I've always wanted to say that.

00:11.300 --> 00:12.450
My name is Peter Parker.

00:12.950 --> 00:14.750
And life is pretty darn good.

00:15.350 --> 00:19.000
Norman Osbourne is finally behind bars where he can't hurt anyone.

00:20.650 --> 00:21.850
And after our last battle,...

00:22.000 --> 00:24.200
...my deadliest enemies have all gone into hiding,...

00:24.500 --> 00:27.500
...so hopefully they won't be making any trouble for me anytime soon.

00:28.100 --> 00:31.700
Plus, I've got a new Spider-Girl protecting the friendly neighborhood with me...

00:32.100 --> 00:34.600
...which allows me to spend time with my girlfriend, Carlie,...

00:35.150 --> 00:37.450
...and focus on my new job at Horizon Labs.

00:38.050 --> 00:40.550
I even have time to make new weapons and new costumes.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.800
The world doesn't know what they're in for.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.550
Looks like the Parker luck is finally changing.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.400
Let's just hope it stays that way.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.350
'Cause there's no denying, I've hit the big time!

00:50.750 --> 00:52.500
And no one's gonna bring me down.

00:54.100 --> 00:54.800
Let 'em try.
