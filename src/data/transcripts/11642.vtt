Fujitsu is a computer brand known for their computers and tablets...

00:06.750 --> 00:11.050
...mainly for the professional fields, medical offices, and sales force automation.

00:11.400 --> 00:16.250
But they are a huge company in Japan involved in many things including robotics.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.150
And what they've developed here is a concept bear...

00:19.650 --> 00:23.150
...that is stuffed with software and a camera and sensors...

00:23.450 --> 00:26.600
...that actually react to the way you act in the room.

00:26.950 --> 00:29.300
The bear has a built-in webcam in its nose...

00:29.600 --> 00:33.850
...and facial recognition software inside the bear can detect what kind of mood you're in.

00:34.100 --> 00:37.000
If you're happy or sad or even crying.

00:37.550 --> 00:41.850
And of course, it has sensors built in so if you tickle the bear, it actually interacts with you.

00:42.700 --> 00:45.200
Touch the bear in a bad way and it actually scowls at you.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.700
Now, Fujitsu is developing this bear as a companion for the elderly in Japan.

00:51.050 --> 00:54.650
The idea is that you'll interact with the bear, and keep alert and active.

00:55.050 --> 00:58.100
But it also proves some of the technology that Fujitsu is working on.

00:58.600 --> 01:02.050
The camera has facial recognitions to determine what your mood is.

01:02.250 --> 01:05.400
If you're smiling, happy, sad, drowsy.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.350
And some of the advanced capabilities that you'll have in this bear...

01:08.650 --> 01:11.500
...is it can detect if you've fallen and can't get up,...

01:11.850 --> 01:15.750
...it'll alert people to what you're doing and just keep track of you.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.750
Now, obviously this is just a concept bear and slated only for Japan...

01:20.100 --> 01:22.250
...but we couldn't wait to see this in the United States.

01:22.600 --> 01:25.100
After all, doesn't Teddy Ruxspin need an update?

01:25.850 --> 01:27.550
