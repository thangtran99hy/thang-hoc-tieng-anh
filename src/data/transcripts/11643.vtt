00:02.050 --> 00:04.850
Saint Patrick's Day is celebrated all around the world.

00:05.300 --> 00:11.350
But its true meaning can be overshadowed by leprechauns, three - leaf clovers, and wearing the color green.

00:14.750 --> 00:19.450
I believe there's some confusion about exactly what are we celebrating on Saint Patrick's Day.

00:19.750 --> 00:23.750
The main point of Saint Patrick's Day is not about being Irish per se,...

00:24.350 --> 00:25.700
...even though that's part of it.

00:26.350 --> 00:27.700
But it's about mission.

00:28.450 --> 00:32.500
A mission detailed in two letters Saint Patrick wrote in the 5th century.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.300
Father Billy Swan is studying the letter's theological and spiritual content.

00:37.750 --> 00:41.600
Father Swan says the saint details the main events in his life,...

00:42.100 --> 00:44.750
...particularly one that changed it all.

00:45.150 --> 00:48.200
When he was just 16 years old growing up in Britain,...

00:48.500 --> 00:52.400
...pirates kidnapped Saint Patrick and took him to Ireland as a slave.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.600
But after six years, he managed to escape.

00:56.100 --> 01:01.200
And then he tells us an amazing thing that, after a while of being at home again,...

01:01.650 --> 01:06.950
...he felt his call to return to Ireland and to bring the Gospel to the Irish people,...

01:07.050 --> 01:09.350
...to the people who had taken him captive.

01:09.850 --> 01:15.200
Father Swan says his patron saint wanted to include the Irish people in the family of nations...

01:15.550 --> 01:18.000
...who would know God's salvation at the end of time.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.750
But Saint Patrick would face many obstacles.

01:21.050 --> 01:26.350
Yet, he still had a great success and baptized thousands of people to the Christian faith.

01:26.700 --> 01:30.950
His life always fascinated me from the time I heard of it as a child in school.

01:31.650 --> 01:36.200
The teachers always used to tell us the story about Saint Patrick, coming up to Saint Patrick's Day.

01:36.950 --> 01:41.550
And my fascination and admiration of his story and of his life...

01:42.550 --> 01:44.250
...has continued up to this present day.

01:45.300 --> 01:50.450
A life that's remembered 16 centuries later every March 17th,...

01:50.750 --> 01:53.300
...the date believed to be the day he died.
