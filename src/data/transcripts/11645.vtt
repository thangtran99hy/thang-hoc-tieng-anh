00:03.260 --> 00:05.170
I thought I told you to go to bed.

00:05.400 --> 00:08.400
You told me to go to bed, you didn't say get into bed.

00:08.500 --> 00:09.100
Milo!

00:11.570 --> 00:12.900
I shouldn't have said what I said.

00:13.110 --> 00:14.810
I'm gonna go tell her I'm sorry right now.

00:16.010 --> 00:21.280
Mom? Mom? Mom! Let her go!

00:21.920 --> 00:23.620
Ah! Let me go!

00:25.190 --> 00:26.820
I'm in a spaceship.

00:29.660 --> 00:31.660
48 million miles from home.

00:31.760 --> 00:32.490
Welcome to Mars.

00:32.590 --> 00:33.630
What is going on?

00:33.730 --> 00:34.930
Mars needs moms.

00:35.030 --> 00:37.630
The aliens are stealing them from Earth to raise their own kids.

00:37.730 --> 00:39.400
One Earthling has one night...

00:39.600 --> 00:40.550
Less than seven hours?

00:40.640 --> 00:43.040
...to save Earth's most valuable resource.

00:43.140 --> 00:44.170
I'm just trying to find my mom.

00:44.770 --> 00:47.280
She's the one that feeds me, she vacuums the house.

00:49.910 --> 00:50.450
Come on!

00:50.880 --> 00:51.710
On March 11th.

00:52.780 --> 00:54.450
Man, Mars needs botox.

00:54.650 --> 00:55.380
Get ready...

00:57.350 --> 00:59.420
Guys, I've got the ship under control. I'm good.

01:01.460 --> 01:04.690
Don't come any closer, I know karate. Well, at least on the Wii.

01:05.160 --> 01:07.100
...for the mother of all adventures.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.000
I dig it when you change color.

01:09.260 --> 01:09.530
What?

01:12.300 --> 01:13.840
How do we get past all those Martians?

01:13.940 --> 01:18.410
Duh, fire butt blasters. This thing is going on the Christmas list.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.640
Mars Needs Moms.

01:21.140 --> 01:22.410
Dude, you march like a girl.

01:23.550 --> 01:24.610
In 3D.

01:26.050 --> 01:26.610
March 11.
