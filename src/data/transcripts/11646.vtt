I'm sending you some snapshots of Korea...

00:10.670 --> 00:12.980
...with its four distinct seasons.

00:14.810 --> 00:16.680
Tradition meets modernity...

00:17.810 --> 00:20.320
...in the heart of one of the world's biggest cities.

00:22.120 --> 00:26.920
All this beauty and excitement can be found here in Korea.

00:30.790 --> 00:33.400
We would like to share these marvels with you.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.930
This is why we look forward to you visiting Korea.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.970
I'm thinking of you today,...

00:45.010 --> 00:46.980
...as I often do these days.

00:50.180 --> 00:52.050
I'm glad that we are friends.

00:56.220 --> 00:57.350
We are your friends.

00:59.390 --> 01:01.490
We share dreams and happiness.

01:05.590 --> 01:10.630
We are sharing our unique writing system, Hangul, invented in 1443.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.500
It's one of the world's most scientific alphabets.

01:27.050 --> 01:30.450
We are learning and preparing many things...

01:31.320 --> 01:33.960
...for our time together is precious.

01:50.570 --> 01:53.070
You and I, we are friends.

01:58.480 --> 02:00.580
We're closer than ever before.

02:04.050 --> 02:07.060
I am your friend and you are mine.

02:13.060 --> 02:14.560
We are friends.
