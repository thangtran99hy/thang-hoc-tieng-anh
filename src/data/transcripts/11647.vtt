She's been waiting half an hour, what took you so long?

00:10.000 --> 00:13.300
I'm in a hurry, my back is killing me, can we just do this?

00:15.150 --> 00:17.050
I just got a collection notice from you people.

00:17.250 --> 00:19.250
If this affects my credit, I will sue!

00:21.800 --> 00:25.650
Do you feel as though your job becomes more demanding and stressful every day?

00:26.300 --> 00:28.400
For most of us, there's just too much to do...

00:28.800 --> 00:30.650
...and not enough time to get it done.

00:31.400 --> 00:32.650
With pressures like these,...

00:32.800 --> 00:37.550
...it can be all too easy to forget about the needs of the person we're here to help:...

00:39.250 --> 00:39.950
...the patient.

00:40.650 --> 00:45.150
The result: patient dissatisfaction, patient complaints,...

00:45.900 --> 00:48.300
...and even more job stress for you.

00:48.850 --> 00:57.000
Today more than ever, it's important we learn how to handle patient complaints easily and quickly.

00:57.350 --> 01:02.550
What we need is a simple, easy-to-remember formula for managing patient complaints:...

01:06.150 --> 01:06.800
...STAT.
