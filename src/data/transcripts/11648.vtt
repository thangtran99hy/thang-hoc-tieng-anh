00:15.150 --> 00:18.350
What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple request.

00:19.450 --> 00:25.100
I'd like all of you to pause for a moment, you wretched weaklings,...

00:25.850 --> 00:28.550
...and take stock of your miserable existence. 

00:32.650 --> 00:38.250
Now, that was the advice that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century.

00:39.050 --> 00:42.600
It was the advice that I decided to follow myself when I turned 40.

00:43.400 --> 00:46.800
Up until that moment, I had been that classic corporate warrior.

00:47.150 --> 00:50.300
I was eating too much, I was drinking too much, I was working too hard,...

00:50.600 --> 00:51.850
...and I was neglecting my family.

00:52.850 --> 00:56.300
And I decided that I would try and turn my life around.

00:56.550 --> 01:02.250
In particular, I decided I would try to address the thorny issue of work - life balance.

01:03.400 --> 01:06.250
So, I stepped back from the workforce...

01:06.850 --> 01:12.100
...and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children.

01:13.150 --> 01:16.100
But all I learned about work - life balance from that year...

01:16.700 --> 01:22.400
...was that I found it quite easy to balance work and life when I didn't have any work.

01:26.250 --> 01:30.500
Not a very useful skill, especially when the money runs out.

01:31.450 --> 01:37.900
So, I went back to work, and I've spent these seven years since struggling with...

01:38.750 --> 01:42.600
...studying and writing about work - life balance.

01:42.950 --> 01:46.200
And I have four observations I'd like to share with you today.

01:47.100 --> 01:53.750
The first is, if society is to make any progress on this issue, we need an honest debate.

01:54.700 --> 01:59.800
But the trouble is, so many people talk so much rubbish about work - life balance.

02:01.300 --> 02:07.900
All the discussions about flexitime, or dress-down Fridays, or paternity leave...

02:08.450 --> 02:11.050
...only serve to mask the core issue,...

02:12.300 --> 02:19.100
...which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible...

02:20.250 --> 02:24.500
...with being meaningfully engaged on a day-to-day basis with a young family.

02:27.600 --> 02:32.500
Now, the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in.

02:33.100 --> 02:35.900
And the reality of the society that we're in...

02:36.850 --> 02:40.050
...is there are thousands and thousands of people out there...

02:40.500 --> 02:43.500
...leading lives of quiet, screaming desperation...

02:44.500 --> 02:48.050
...where they work long, hard hours at jobs they hate...

02:48.650 --> 02:50.550
...to enable them to buy things they don't need,...

02:51.000 --> 02:52.500
...to impress people they don't like. 

02:57.500 --> 03:01.400
It's my contention that going to work on a Friday in jeans and T-shirt...

03:01.650 --> 03:03.250
...isn't really getting to the nub of the issue.
