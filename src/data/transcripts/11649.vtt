Well, my name is Lisa Ray and you could say I'm an accidental actress.

00:04.677 --> 00:07.735
I believe cinema is about connecting with your humanity.

00:08.650 --> 00:12.310
There are good films and there are bad films, and then there are Bollywood films.

00:12.900 --> 00:15.610
Bollywood simply has its own grammar, its own way of doing things.

00:16.400 --> 00:21.800
It's really larger than life. It was a great experience to sort of be a part of that world...

00:22.500 --> 00:23.757
...for a certain period of time.

00:24.220 --> 00:27.505
But, I'm Canadian and so my sensibility is a lot more...

00:28.789 --> 00:31.839
...I guess in terms of cinema, is expressed a lot more humanistic.

00:32.750 --> 00:35.427
It's a lot more real and naturalistic.

00:35.784 --> 00:38.500
Indian culture is very, very strong...

00:39.747 --> 00:45.263
...and it kind of tends to like, overshadow a lot of other cultures, that's sort of my experience.

00:46.170 --> 00:49.515
I guess, I lean most towards Buddhist philosophy.

00:50.218 --> 00:56.029
But there's a big overlap as well between Hinduism and Buddhism and again it all depends on what...

00:57.754 --> 01:02.148
...brand of Hinduism are you talking about. It was my acting that led me actually towards Buddhism.

01:03.300 --> 01:05.811
In June 2009, I was diagnosed with multiple myeloma,...

01:06.556 --> 01:09.831
...which is a cancer of the plasma cells in the bone marrow...

01:10.273 --> 01:11.987
...and I immediately started treatment.

01:12.644 --> 01:16.917
I'm on the road to recovery. I think that the healing begins when you realize there's no cure.

01:17.492 --> 01:22.918
It's really a lot healthier to sort of surrender some aspect of our lives.
