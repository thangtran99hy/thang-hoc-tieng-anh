The word "peace" may have different meanings to different people.

00:04.770 --> 00:08.206
To many, peace is what enables development...

00:08.515 --> 00:12.472
...and is critical in providing opportunities to young people.

00:13.780 --> 00:18.010
To some, especially to those from regions involving conflict,...

00:18.410 --> 00:23.820
...peace keeping and efforts to preserve peace...

00:24.720 --> 00:30.360
...are absolutely vital in bringing prosperity and hope for the future.

00:31.530 --> 00:35.730
To me, peace represents a state of mind, being at peace with yourself.

00:36.460 --> 00:40.640
I believe that when you are at peace with yourself, both mentally and physically,...

00:40.940 --> 00:42.140
...you can achieve anything.

00:44.070 --> 00:47.840
Peace is what allows us, especially young people, to dream,...

00:47.980 --> 00:52.250
...go after one's goals, and prepare you for the next challenge in life.

00:53.380 --> 00:54.350
There is a saying,...

00:54.820 --> 00:59.990
..."Where there is peace, there is culture. Where there is culture, there is peace."

01:00.960 --> 01:04.890
However, as an athlete and figure skater, I would like to say,...

01:05.260 --> 01:10.670
..."Where there is peace, there is sports. Where there is sports, there is peace."

01:12.570 --> 01:17.410
The International Day of Peace provides a valuable opportunity for everyone...

01:17.770 --> 01:19.345
...to observe peace together.

01:20.340 --> 01:22.110
As we come together in unity,...

01:22.340 --> 01:25.910
...let us take a moment to reflect on what each of us can do...

01:26.310 --> 01:28.720
...to build peace around the world. Thank you!
