So, this is the heart of a data center. It's a server room. It's one of the ten giant server rooms...

00:06.940 --> 00:11.310
...at this particular center with as many as 30,000 servers,...

00:11.610 --> 00:15.710
...and each of them all possess a vast amount of computing power, and an awful lot of storage.

00:15.940 --> 00:20.150
And all part really of this big ramping output of cloud computers.

00:20.910 --> 00:24.590
And here's Mike Menaz from Microsoft, you run the data center operations.

00:24.990 --> 00:29.520
Mike, just give us a sense of the scale, how much can be stored in a place like this?

00:29.720 --> 00:33.330
Well, I did a little calculations and if we apply it to something that everyone likes to do,...

00:33.430 --> 00:35.460
...which is storing pictures up on the Internet,...

00:36.970 --> 00:42.070
...a facility of this size can house somewhere in the neighborhood of 6.75 trillion photos...

00:42.740 --> 00:44.800
...for the users of our cloud applications.

00:45.020 --> 00:49.010
Now, people will be worried about a couple of things. They'll be worried about security...

00:49.910 --> 00:54.720
...in terms of people getting hold of their data. They'll be worried about what happens if a place like this shuts down.

00:55.480 --> 01:01.360
Well, from a security perspective and from a redundancy perspective, a facility like this is pretty hardened.

01:01.990 --> 01:05.690
As you probably saw as you came in, security is pretty tight on the outside.

01:06.260 --> 01:09.100
Logically, in terms of getting access to your data,...

01:09.330 --> 01:13.440
...we have pretty significant security measures deployed to protect the users.

01:13.640 --> 01:17.740
If the facility were to go down, if there was a catastrophic event, for example,...

01:18.710 --> 01:22.740
...we have the ability in our application software, in our cloud infrastructure,...

01:22.910 --> 01:25.550
...to fill all of this over to other facilities.

01:25.910 --> 01:29.650
So, you'll never have an issue of not being able to get to your data...

01:29.720 --> 01:31.050
...wherever you happen to be from.

01:31.250 --> 01:34.790
OK, Mike. Thank you very much! So, that's one data center.

01:35.060 --> 01:39.990
Part of this huge battle developing in the clouds between the likes of Microsoft, Google, and Amazon...

01:40.500 --> 01:43.400
...to take us into the future of cloud computing.
