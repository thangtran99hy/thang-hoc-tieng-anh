00:00.650 --> 00:04.000
The second observation I'd like to make is we need to face the truth...

00:04.350 --> 00:09.700
...that governments and corporations aren't going to solve this issue for us.

00:10.350 --> 00:11.700
We should stop looking outside.

00:11.900 --> 00:16.463
It's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility...

00:16.593 --> 00:19.285
...for the type of lives that we want to lead.

00:20.200 --> 00:24.400
If you don't design your life, someone else will design it for you,...

00:24.700 --> 00:27.700
...and you may just not like their idea of balance.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.900
It's particularly important,...

00:31.900 --> 00:33.700
...this isn't on the World Wide Web is it, I'm about to get fired...

00:33.900 --> 00:38.401
...it's particularly important that you never put the quality of your life...

00:38.666 --> 00:41.031
...in the hands of a commercial corporation.

00:42.550 --> 00:45.500
Now, I'm not talking here just about the bad companies,...

00:45.900 --> 00:48.000
...the abattoirs of the human soul as I call them.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.100
I'm talking about all companies.

00:53.750 --> 01:01.050
Because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you as they can get away with.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.900
It's in their nature, it's in their DNA, it's what they do...

01:05.150 --> 01:07.800
...even the good, well-intentioned companies.

01:08.600 --> 01:14.200
On the one hand, putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened.

01:15.267 --> 01:17.038
On the other hand, it's a nightmare.

01:17.150 --> 01:19.639
It just means you spend more time at the bloody office.

01:21.450 --> 01:27.700
We have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life.

01:29.767 --> 01:35.408
The third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame...

01:35.817 --> 01:38.987
...that we choose upon which to judge our balance.

01:40.450 --> 01:43.900
Before I went back to work after my year at home,...

01:44.550 --> 01:51.550
...I sat down and I wrote out a detailed, step-by-step description...

01:52.100 --> 01:55.700
...of the ideal balanced day that I aspired to.

01:57.150 --> 01:58.350
And it went like this:...

01:59.350 --> 02:02.850
Wake up well rested after a good night's sleep.

02:04.450 --> 02:05.200
Have sex.

02:07.050 --> 02:07.850
Walk the dog.

02:08.700 --> 02:11.200
Have breakfast with my wife and children.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.400
Have sex again.

02:16.550 --> 02:18.900
Drive the kids to school on the way to the office.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.250
Do three hours of work.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.800
Play sport with a friend at lunch time.

02:25.100 --> 02:26.200
Do another three hours of work.

02:27.300 --> 02:29.700
Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink.

02:31.050 --> 02:34.900
Drive home for dinner with my wife and kids.

02:35.900 --> 02:37.250
Meditate for half an hour.

02:38.350 --> 02:39.150
Have sex.

02:40.550 --> 02:41.350
Walk the dog.

02:42.350 --> 02:43.250
Have sex again.

02:44.500 --> 02:45.150
Go to bed.

02:51.850 --> 02:53.350
How often do you think I have that day?

02:56.650 --> 02:58.200
We need to be realistic.

02:58.650 --> 03:01.000
You can't do it all in one day.

03:01.200 --> 03:06.000
We need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life,...

03:06.050 --> 03:09.600
...but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of...

03:10.000 --> 03:12.250
...the "I'll have a life when I retire,"...

03:13.100 --> 03:14.550
..."when my kids have left home,"...

03:14.750 --> 03:16.500
..."when my wife has divorced me,"...

03:16.700 --> 03:17.700
..."my health is failing,"...

03:17.900 --> 03:19.700
..."I've got no mates or interests left."

03:21.650 --> 03:24.500
A day is too short, after I retire it's too long.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.250
There's got to be a middle way.
