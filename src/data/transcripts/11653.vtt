00:01.500 --> 00:02.550
A fourth observation:...

00:03.200 --> 00:07.300
...We need to approach balance in a balanced way.

00:08.600 --> 00:12.050
A friend came to see me last year and she doesn't mind me telling this story.

00:12.400 --> 00:15.500
A friend came to see me last year and said, "Nigel, I've read your book."

00:15.800 --> 00:18.300
"And I realize that my life is completely out of balance."

00:18.650 --> 00:21.100
"It's totally dominated by work."

00:21.700 --> 00:24.500
"I work ten hours a day. I commute two hours a day."

00:25.100 --> 00:26.750
"All of my relationships have failed."

00:27.050 --> 00:29.650
"There's nothing in my life apart from my work."

00:30.450 --> 00:33.450
"So, I've decided to get a grip and sort it out."

00:34.550 --> 00:35.600
"So, I've joined a gym."

00:38.900 --> 00:41.200
Now, I don't mean to mock,...

00:42.100 --> 00:47.900
...but being a fit, 10 - hour a day office rat isn't more balanced, it's more fit.

00:51.300 --> 00:55.500
Lovely though physical exercise may be, there are other parts to life.

00:55.767 --> 00:57.958
There's the intellectual side, there's the emotional side,...

00:58.038 --> 00:59.412
...there's the spiritual side.

00:59.600 --> 01:05.050
And to be balanced, I believe, we have to attend to all of those areas.

01:05.350 --> 01:07.000
Not just do 50 stomach crunches.

01:08.700 --> 01:10.450
Now, that can be daunting.

01:10.850 --> 01:13.600
'Cause people say, "Bloody hell, mate! I haven't got time to get fit."

01:13.800 --> 01:15.250
"You want me to go to church and call my mother?"

01:16.350 --> 01:17.700
I understand.

01:18.100 --> 01:20.550
I truly understand how that can be daunting.

01:21.200 --> 01:25.300
But an incident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective.

01:26.033 --> 01:28.798
My wife, who is somewhere in the audience today,...

01:29.082 --> 01:32.004
...called me up at the office and said,...

01:32.400 --> 01:35.750
..."Nigel, you need to pick our youngest son up, Harry, from school."

01:36.400 --> 01:38.950
'Cause she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening.

01:40.150 --> 01:45.750
So, I left work an hour early that afternoon and picked Harry up at the school gates.

01:46.700 --> 01:50.537
We walked down to the local park, messed around on the swings,...

01:50.636 --> 01:51.711
...played some silly games.

01:52.300 --> 01:54.450
I, then, walked him up the hill to the local cafe...

01:54.800 --> 01:56.600
...and we shared pizza for tea,...

01:57.700 --> 01:59.700
...then walked down the hill to our home,...

02:00.400 --> 02:03.500
...and I gave him his bath, and put him in his Batman pajamas.

02:04.500 --> 02:08.300
I, then, read him a chapter of Roald Dahl's James and the Giant Peach.

02:09.433 --> 02:10.986
I, then, put him to bed, tucked him in,...

02:11.077 --> 02:13.172
...gave him a kiss on his forehead and said, "Good night, mate,"...

02:13.750 --> 02:15.400
...and walked out of his bedroom.

02:16.400 --> 02:19.000
As I was walking out of his bedroom, he said, "Dad?"

02:19.550 --> 02:20.300
I went, "Yes, mate?"

02:20.750 --> 02:25.700
He went, "Dad, this has been the best day of my life ever."

02:28.300 --> 02:29.100
I hadn't done anything.

02:30.550 --> 02:32.550
I hadn't taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation.

02:33.750 --> 02:37.450
Now, my point is the small things matter.

02:38.900 --> 02:43.600
Being more balanced doesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life.

02:43.800 --> 02:47.350
With the smallest investment in the right places,...

02:47.600 --> 02:52.600
...you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life.

02:53.200 --> 02:56.950
Moreover, I think, it can transform society.

02:57.550 --> 02:59.600
Because if enough people do it,...

02:59.800 --> 03:06.150
...we can change society's definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion...

03:06.300 --> 03:08.600
...that the person with the most money when he dies wins,...

03:09.500 --> 03:15.400
...to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well - lived looks like.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.450
And that, I think, is an idea worth spreading.
