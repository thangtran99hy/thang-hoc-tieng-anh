00:01.830 --> 00:02.330
Yes, sir?

00:02.700 --> 00:04.230
I'd like to have an argument, please.

00:04.330 --> 00:06.900
Certainly, sir. Have you been here before?

00:07.050 --> 00:08.250
No, this is my first time.

00:08.550 --> 00:13.270
I see. Do you want to have the full argument or were you thinking of taking a course?

00:13.640 --> 00:15.080
Well, what would be the cost?

00:15.380 --> 00:20.820
Well, yes. It's one pound for a five minute argument, but only eight pounds for a course of ten.

00:21.950 --> 00:25.290
Well, I think it's probably best if I start with the one and see how it goes from there, okay?

00:25.390 --> 00:29.960
Fine, I'll see who's free at the moment. Try Mr. Barnard, room 12.

00:30.130 --> 00:30.490
Thank you.

00:34.260 --> 00:34.630
Come in.

00:36.260 --> 00:37.670
Is this the right room for an argument?

00:38.430 --> 00:39.530
I've told you once.

00:40.700 --> 00:41.200
No, you haven't.

00:41.300 --> 00:41.970
Yes, I have.

00:42.600 --> 00:42.870
When?

00:42.970 --> 00:43.570
Just now.

00:44.370 --> 00:44.840
No, you didn't.

00:44.940 --> 00:45.410
Yes, I did.

00:45.510 --> 00:45.810
You didn't.

00:46.010 --> 00:46.240
I did.

00:46.340 --> 00:46.670
You didn't.

00:46.770 --> 00:47.410
I'm telling you, I did.

00:47.510 --> 00:48.180
You did not.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.650
I'm sorry, is this a five minute argument or the full half hour?

00:51.810 --> 00:53.720
Oh oh! Just the five minute one.

00:53.950 --> 00:59.090
Fine. Thank you. Anyway, I did.

00:59.250 --> 01:00.090
You most certainly did not.

01:00.200 --> 01:03.490
Now, let's get one thing quite clear. I most definitely told you.

01:03.630 --> 01:03.990
You did not.

01:04.150 --> 01:04.390
I did.

01:04.490 --> 01:04.890
Didn't.

01:04.990 --> 01:05.560
Yes, I did.

01:05.730 --> 01:07.000
Look, this isn't an argument.

01:07.400 --> 01:07.860
Yes, it is.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.160
No, it isn't. It's just contradiction.

01:09.300 --> 01:09.700
No, it isn't.

01:09.830 --> 01:10.270
Yes, it is.

01:10.400 --> 01:10.900
It is not.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.200
It is. You just contradicted me.

01:13.300 --> 01:13.700
No, I didn't.

01:13.800 --> 01:14.300
Oh, you did.

01:14.450 --> 01:15.600
No, no, no, no.

01:15.870 --> 01:16.870
You did just there.

01:17.120 --> 01:17.740
Nonsense!

01:17.870 --> 01:18.870
Oh look, this is futile.

01:18.970 --> 01:19.370
No, it isn't.

01:19.710 --> 01:20.740
I came here for good argument.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.310
No, you didn't. You came here for an argument.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.080
Well, argument is not the same as contradiction.

01:24.610 --> 01:24.980
Can be.

01:25.092 --> 01:25.866
No, it can't.

01:26.233 --> 01:29.413
An argument is a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition.

01:30.150 --> 01:30.620
No, it isn't.

01:30.820 --> 01:32.520
Yes, it is. It isn't just contradiction.

01:32.690 --> 01:35.220
Look, if I argue with you, I must take up a contrary position.

01:36.020 --> 01:37.390
But it isn't just saying "No, it isn't".

01:37.540 --> 01:37.860
Yes, it is.

01:37.960 --> 01:38.490
No, it isn't.

01:40.360 --> 01:41.730
Argument is an intellectual process.

01:41.830 --> 01:45.400
Contradiction is just the automatic gainsaying of anything the other person says.

01:45.420 --> 01:45.930
No, it isn't.

01:46.200 --> 01:46.600
Yes, it is.

01:46.800 --> 01:47.240
Not at all.

01:47.340 --> 01:47.700
Now, look.

01:48.500 --> 01:49.500
Thank you. Good morning!
