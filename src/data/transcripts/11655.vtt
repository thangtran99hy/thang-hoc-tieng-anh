Today, I wanted to show you some Google tricks.

00:02.260 --> 00:05.870
The first one is called "define." It's like a dictionary.

00:05.970 --> 00:11.310
If you type "define" in the search field and then colon, and then a word like "computer".

00:11.410 --> 00:12.340
And then hit "Enter".

00:12.910 --> 00:15.480
You'll get a whole bunch of definitions for the word "computer".

00:15.580 --> 00:18.550
So, if you don't have a dictionary handy, you can look it up on the web...

00:18.950 --> 00:24.990
...and get all the official descriptions here and meanings for a word. In this case, "computer."

00:25.490 --> 00:29.120
The other neat little trick is using the Google calculator.

00:29.490 --> 00:32.960
So, in the search field, you can put in a formula, for example.

00:33.230 --> 00:35.160
So, if you don't have a calculator handy...

00:35.600 --> 00:41.570
...and you know a formula, so 2 to the power of 10 plus 7 times 98 plus 500%

00:41.770 --> 00:45.210
So, you can type in whatever you want in here, a valid formula.

00:45.570 --> 00:50.610
And then after that, click the Google search and then you'll get the results.

00:50.910 --> 00:52.650
So, just like a calculator there you go,...

00:53.050 --> 00:56.750
...it knows exactly what you typed in and there's the answer.

00:56.950 --> 00:59.120
So, neat little calculator trick there.

00:59.490 --> 01:03.590
So, last but not least, finding music.

01:03.890 --> 01:07.200
Okay, if you wanted to find a specific type of music online...

01:07.560 --> 01:12.600
...quickly, you can type in this long bunch of parameters here.

01:12.770 --> 01:17.340
And then, the title of the song, or the group or the band or whatever that you wanna search for.

01:17.610 --> 01:22.510
Okay, so this is the long string here that you need to type in the search field.

01:22.940 --> 01:24.180
And then you hit "Enter".

01:24.710 --> 01:29.980
And it found the site here, the first result. If I just click on that website.

01:30.250 --> 01:35.620
It's just a directory listing actually, that has a whole bunch of different folders and files...

01:36.990 --> 01:38.630
...with MP3s in them actually.

01:39.060 --> 01:45.430
So, of course if these are commercial MP3s, I don't endorse you to go ahead and download...

01:46.030 --> 01:50.210
...copyrighted music, but it's a neat little thing that many people don't know about.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.770
So, I hope you enjoyed the video and thank you for watching.
