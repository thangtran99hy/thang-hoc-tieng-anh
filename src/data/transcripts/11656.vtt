Hello, I'm Syndi Seid, an etiquette coach.

00:11.233 --> 00:17.950
Something people often ask me is how do you properly give an introduction in a business setting.

00:18.700 --> 00:23.317
So here is my two - step golden rule to proper introductions.

00:23.900 --> 00:29.260
First, always remember the first person's name out of your mouth...

00:29.467 --> 00:32.317
...should be the most important person's name.

00:32.967 --> 00:38.650
Thereafter, everyone else is introduced to that most important person.

00:39.667 --> 00:46.950
But actually, rank and status are the primary determinants to who takes precedence over whom.

00:51.233 --> 00:54.450
When introducing someone, never use the word "meet".

00:54.867 --> 01:01.417
For example, Jane Doe is the CEO of a company and John Smith is a new staff person.

01:02.033 --> 01:07.583
You would never want to say, "Jane Doe, I would like you to meet John Smith."

01:08.133 --> 01:11.108
...because it actually throws the emphasis...

01:11.241 --> 01:16.383
...off the most important person on to that second person, John Smith.

01:17.267 --> 01:23.350
Rather, if you want an informal introduction, how about using the word, "This is."

01:23.817 --> 01:28.450
Example, "Jane Doe, this is John Smith."

01:32.633 --> 01:38.017
When using the more traditional word "introduce," be careful not to get too wordy.

01:38.567 --> 01:42.517
For instance, which of these three sentences is correct?

01:43.067 --> 01:48.783
Is it a: Jane Doe, may I introduce John Smith.

01:49.667 --> 01:54.917
b: Ms. Doe, may I introduce to you Mr. Smith.

01:55.733 --> 02:01.850
Or c: Jane Doe, may I introduce you to John Smith.

02:02.533 --> 02:05.717
If you chose a or b, you would be correct.

02:06.233 --> 02:11.183
However, a is the best answer because it uses the fewest words.

02:14.367 --> 02:18.483
So here are a few other tips to keep in mind when introducing someone.

02:19.433 --> 02:21.783
Always keep the honorifics even.

02:22.367 --> 02:26.717
If you use Ms. Doe, you must use Mr. Smith.

02:27.433 --> 02:31.917
However, you can use first names such as Jane or John,...

02:32.500 --> 02:36.450
...but in this case you must include their last name as well.

02:38.017 --> 02:42.883
And lastly, do share some information about each person you're introducing...

02:43.367 --> 02:48.783
...so that they can springboard their conversation and you can exit to meet some other people.

02:50.067 --> 02:53.983
So there you have it, some quick tips on proper introductions.

02:54.700 --> 02:55.783
Happy practicing.
