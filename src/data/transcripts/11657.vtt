Hey, I'm Donald Bell for CNET.com.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.950
We're here at Apple's iPad 2 Launch Event and I'm holding the iPad 2.

00:09.050 --> 00:11.550
In fact, I'm holding the white version of the iPad 2.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.300
There are now two colors: a white version and a black version.

00:14.750 --> 00:17.650
All the same prices, all the same capacities as last year's,...

00:18.250 --> 00:20.900
...but you're now getting a much thinner design, a lighter design,...

00:21.300 --> 00:22.750
...and also getting a faster processor.

00:23.150 --> 00:25.750
There's a dual-core A5 processor in here.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.700
It's promising nine times the graphics performance of the original iPad.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.250
You're also getting a few new features.

00:31.350 --> 00:33.650
You're getting a FaceTime feature for video calling.

00:34.200 --> 00:38.150
You get a HD camera on the back and a VGA camera on the front.

00:38.800 --> 00:42.400
Apple is also announcing two new applications for the iPad, their own applications.

00:42.450 --> 00:46.750
One is iMovie for the iPad, which was available before in the iPhone and the iPod Touch.

00:47.100 --> 00:48.200
It's now coming to the iPad.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.200
Well, at least, the most sophisticated mobile version of iMovie we've seen yet.

00:53.650 --> 00:57.400
The other application that Apple announced today for the iPad is GarageBand.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.750
This is gonna be a pretty cool application out there for you musical types.

01:00.800 --> 01:04.200
It does multitrack recording, virtual instruments, a lot of fun.

01:04.900 --> 01:06.750
We're gonna see this thing March 11th.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.650
So, having played around with the iPad 2, the little bit that I've had it here,...

01:09.750 --> 01:14.200
...I have to say the thing I like about it the most is how thin and light Apple's been able to get the design.

01:14.750 --> 01:16.700
Having seen a lot of their competitors this past year,...

01:16.900 --> 01:18.800
...I haven't seen anything that's gotten this small.

01:19.250 --> 01:22.200
And I think being able to preserve that 10 - hour battery life is a big deal.

01:22.450 --> 01:23.900
It's gonna be harder to be able to keep up with that.

01:23.950 --> 01:27.950
So, for CNET.com, I'm Donald Bell showing off the Apple iPad 2.
