00:00.891 --> 00:03.532
The American people extend our deepest condolences...

00:03.707 --> 00:07.775
...to the families and loved ones of all who've been killed and injured.

00:08.868 --> 00:13.033
The suffering and bloodshed is outrageous and it is unacceptable,...

00:14.034 --> 00:20.015
...so are threats and orders to shoot peaceful protesters and further punish the people of Libya.

00:21.181 --> 00:26.593
These actions violate international norms and every standard of common decency.

00:27.754 --> 00:29.003
This violence must stop.

00:31.301 --> 00:35.561
The United States also strongly supports the universal rights of the Libyan people.

00:36.667 --> 00:39.749
That includes the rights of peaceful assembly, free speech,...

00:40.357 --> 00:43.615
...and the ability of the Libyan people to determine their own destiny.

00:44.781 --> 00:45.733
These are human rights.

00:46.744 --> 00:47.870
They are not negotiable.

00:48.667 --> 00:50.919
They must be respected in every country.

00:51.663 --> 00:54.484
And they cannot be denied through violence or suppression.

00:56.302 --> 00:58.697
In a volatile situation like this one,...

00:59.455 --> 01:03.275
...it is imperative that the nations and peoples of the world speak with one voice,...

01:03.979 --> 01:05.743
...and that has been our focus.

01:06.599 --> 01:10.105
Yesterday, a unanimous UN Security Council sent a clear message...

01:10.320 --> 01:11.844
...that it condemns the violence in Libya...

01:12.526 --> 01:17.272
...supports accountability for the perpetrators, and stands with Libyan people.

01:18.037 --> 01:18.832
So let me be clear.

01:20.061 --> 01:22.955
The change that is taking place across the region...

01:23.757 --> 01:26.276
...is being driven by the people of the region.

01:27.584 --> 01:31.895
This change doesn't represent the work of the United States or any foreign power.

01:32.843 --> 01:36.739
It represents the aspirations of people who are seeking a better life.

01:38.465 --> 01:43.076
As one Libyan said, "We just want to be able to live like human beings."

01:44.665 --> 01:47.175
We just want to be able to live like human beings.

01:47.605 --> 01:52.435
It is the most basic of aspirations that is driving this change.

01:53.095 --> 01:54.575
And throughout this time of transition,...

01:54.666 --> 01:57.051
...the United States will continue to stand up for freedom,...

01:57.641 --> 02:01.319
...stand up for justice, and stand up for the dignity of all people.

02:02.162 --> 02:02.783
Thank you very much.
