00:00.060 --> 00:04.700
Millions across a devastated swath of Japan are suffering for a third day,...

00:05.070 --> 00:09.640
...after what the country's prime minister calls the nation's most severe challenge in decades.

00:09.840 --> 00:12.070
More than 10,000 are feared dead.

00:12.440 --> 00:18.510
Power outages have endangered nuclear reactors adding radiation contamination to the public's fears.

00:18.810 --> 00:21.580
Some survivors are living among the crumbled buildings...

00:21.720 --> 00:25.120
...and muddy debris without proper food, water, and electricity,...

00:25.720 --> 00:29.760
...while others had been huddled in dark and frigid emergency shelters...

00:29.860 --> 00:31.760
...cut off from rescuers and aid.

00:31.890 --> 00:34.800
On Sunday, crews pulled bodies from wrecked houses,...

00:34.950 --> 00:40.040
...shattered tree trunks, and twisted cars as dazed residents roam the nearby streets.

00:40.270 --> 00:43.200
During a rescue operation in Fukushima Prefecture,...

00:43.570 --> 00:45.710
...troops managed to save a 60-year-old man...

00:45.810 --> 00:49.480
...who had floated out to sea on the roof of his home during the tsunami.

00:50.280 --> 00:54.480
Neighboring Miyagi Prefecture, a state with a population of about two million,...

00:54.850 --> 00:58.190
...was one of the hardest hit by the 8.9 magnitude quake.

00:58.690 --> 01:02.060
Authorities say, at least 1,200 people were killed there, but...

01:02.160 --> 01:04.790
...fewer than 400 have been confirmed dead.

01:05.460 --> 01:10.170
Government officials say, nearly two-thirds of the population of one small town in Miyagi...

01:10.470 --> 01:14.200
...haven't been heard from since the tsunami practically washed the town away.

01:15.100 --> 01:19.340
The Japanese government has deployed about 100,000 soldiers to help out.

01:19.840 --> 01:24.580
Blankets, bottled water, and gasoline had been sent to Miyagi and other affected states.

01:24.980 --> 01:28.450
But the prime minister says, it will take days to restore electricity.

01:29.280 --> 01:32.590
Meanwhile, dozens of countries have offered their resources.

01:32.850 --> 01:38.260
Two US aircraft carrier groups were already off Japan's coast and ready to provide assistance,...

01:38.730 --> 01:42.900
...and a pair of American rescue crews, and a five-dog team from Singapore...

01:43.060 --> 01:45.130
...were scheduled to arrive late Sunday.

01:45.770 --> 01:48.100
