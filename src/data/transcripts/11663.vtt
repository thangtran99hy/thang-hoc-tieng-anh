00:00.900 --> 00:02.360
During times like these,...

00:02.860 --> 00:05.200
...it seems like the world will never be the same.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.640
But there is a light beginning to shine again.

00:10.140 --> 00:12.440
The spark began where it always begins,...

00:14.080 --> 00:15.510
...at a restaurant downtown,...

00:17.080 --> 00:18.610
...in a shop on Main Street,...

00:19.120 --> 00:20.750
...a factory around the corner,...

00:21.320 --> 00:24.920
...entrepreneurs like these are the most powerful force in the economy.

00:25.050 --> 00:30.360
They drive change and they'll relentlessly push their businesses to innovate and connect.

00:32.090 --> 00:35.200
As we look to the future, they'll be there ahead of us,...

00:35.560 --> 00:38.570
...lights on, showing us the way forward.

00:38.930 --> 00:42.040
This is just the beginning of the reinvention of business.

00:42.670 --> 00:44.910
And while we're sure we don't know all the answers,...

00:45.340 --> 00:47.140
...we do know one thing for certain,...

00:48.240 --> 00:49.150
...we want to help.

00:55.250 --> 00:57.090
Come see what the beginning looks like...
