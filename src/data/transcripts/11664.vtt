00:00.733 --> 00:04.399
We're going to introduce today, iPad 2.

00:05.074 --> 00:06.913
The second generation iPad.

00:11.533 --> 00:14.150
So, what is iPad 2?

00:14.233 --> 00:14.983
What have we learned?

00:15.100 --> 00:16.350
What can we improve?

00:17.067 --> 00:19.850
Well, it is an all new design.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.017
It is not a tweaked design.

00:22.099 --> 00:24.350
It's not got marginal improvements.

00:24.433 --> 00:26.650
It's a completely new design.

00:27.567 --> 00:31.450
And the first thing is, it's dramatically faster.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.783
We have a new chip we call A5.

00:36.267 --> 00:40.517
Our chip wizards have come up with this and it's great.

00:41.133 --> 00:42.749
It's a dual-core processor.

00:43.833 --> 00:49.583
Alright, two processors inside and so, we get up to twice as fast on CPU performance.

00:50.433 --> 00:53.817
But we've really gone all out on the graphics performance,...

00:54.500 --> 00:57.517
...up to nine times faster graphics.

00:58.467 --> 01:00.417
The graphics in this thing are wonderful.

01:02.767 --> 01:04.776
The same low power as A4.

01:05.155 --> 01:08.575
We don't wanna give up any of that legendary battery life.

01:09.867 --> 01:12.291
And even though others are starting to ship,...

01:12.389 --> 01:16.017
...I think this is gonna be the first dual-core tablet to ship in volume.

01:16.867 --> 01:20.483
So, A5 is really quite an achievement.

01:20.633 --> 01:24.817
And is gonna give us something that's up to twice as fast on CPU performance,...

01:25.067 --> 01:27.316
...up to nine times faster on graphics.

01:27.733 --> 01:29.917
And the first iPad was no slouch.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.850
So, a lot faster with A5.

01:35.267 --> 01:40.383
Second, we built in some cameras for video.

01:41.433 --> 01:47.617
We've got a rear camera out the back and we've got a front-facing camera out the front.

01:49.367 --> 01:51.017
We'll talk more about that in a few minutes.

01:52.567 --> 01:59.017
We've also built in the gyroscope that we have in the iPhone and the iPod Touch.
