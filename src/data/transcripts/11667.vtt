00:00.740 --> 00:04.700
Thank you for coming over to our Fiscal Year 2010 Full Year...

00:05.170 --> 00:10.710
...and Fourth Quarter Financial Results presentation.

00:11.700 --> 00:17.350
Today, we would like to cover fiscal year 2010 full year...

00:17.500 --> 00:24.270
...as well as the fourth quarter opening results and the key highlights of each business.

00:25.580 --> 00:31.690
As you know, Rakuten has been executing a quite unique business model...

00:32.290 --> 00:34.230
...compared with our competitors.

00:34.960 --> 00:44.940
Leveraging our Internet media and traffic, and implemented retail business...

00:45.410 --> 00:50.380
...and finance business in a very good combination.

00:50.880 --> 01:00.920
And I think we are the only group company which has both retail and finance...

01:01.920 --> 01:04.060
...among the many, many Internet companies.

01:05.550 --> 01:08.800
So, let's go to the numbers.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.970
Here are the highlights.

01:13.540 --> 01:19.310
This was the highest levels of sales and profits in Rakuten's history.

01:20.940 --> 01:28.250
We have three segments: Internet services, finance services, and others.

01:29.280 --> 01:32.520
As for Internet services are concerned,...

01:33.000 --> 01:36.520
...sales grew 25.1% YoY,...

01:37.270 --> 01:41.130
...EBITDA grew 16.8% YoY,...

01:41.560 --> 01:44.930
...ordinary profit grew 15.3% YoY.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.140
For the group total, regardless of the fact that our finance business struggled a little bit...

01:51.870 --> 01:54.040
...still sales grew 16.1%,...

01:54.880 --> 01:59.750
...EBITDA  grew 11.8%, ordinary profit grew 13.5%,...

02:00.380 --> 02:05.350
...so it was a very good fiscal year for us.
