You have to ask yourself inside the company,...

00:10.500 --> 00:12.450
..."Where do you allow for crazy ideas?"

00:12.550 --> 00:14.950
For real true risk to take place,...

00:15.000 --> 00:16.500
...risk that will mostly all fail.

00:16.600 --> 00:24.200
If Edison had hundreds of failures on his way to creating the elements inside a light bulb,...

00:24.850 --> 00:25.900
...that's another way to think about it.

00:25.950 --> 00:27.400
Magellan or Columbus,...

00:27.700 --> 00:31.350
...can you imagine today Magellan, you know, receiving any money from the venture capitalists?

00:31.650 --> 00:35.500
You know, just telling that, "I don't have a map, I don't know where I'm heading for,"...

00:35.700 --> 00:41.100
..."I just believe you know, I can bring a lot of, you know, a gold or spices from this trip."

00:41.400 --> 00:42.700
We don't want this risk yet.

00:43.150 --> 00:44.700
We just believe that, you know, okay, fine.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.300
We have so much walls around us.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.300
Why should we take any risk ? And it's kind of a complacency.

00:52.400 --> 00:56.000
So much was invented before, we can just benefit from using these.

00:56.300 --> 01:02.200
Only an ability and willingness, an appetite to take risks can secure future rewards.
