Hi, my name is John Niemira...

00:03.000 --> 00:07.200
...and I want to talk to you today about writing a business model for your business.

00:07.900 --> 00:11.450
Writing a business model is a simplified business plan.

00:11.800 --> 00:15.450
A business model is an overview of your company.

00:15.800 --> 00:20.950
It's not a breakdown in a detail like a business plan, it's a model.

00:21.200 --> 00:26.500
One, it has basically seven to ten different sections which include your income,...

00:26.950 --> 00:28.700
...which include your expenses,...

00:29.100 --> 00:32.000
...include things like marketing, potential customers,...

00:32.700 --> 00:34.150
...what you're working on now,...

00:34.350 --> 00:35.500
...what you're looking for,...

00:35.650 --> 00:38.050
...what you're gonna need for capital for your business,...

00:38.400 --> 00:41.850
...where you wanna go with it, and who you wanna approach with your business.

00:42.200 --> 00:48.600
A model can be as simple as using somebody else's plan and modifying it to fit your business...

00:48.800 --> 00:50.850
...or developing it from the ground up.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.800
Business model is an overview,...

00:52.900 --> 00:54.950
...it's a model of your business,...

00:55.050 --> 00:57.150
...what you want your business to look like,...

00:57.200 --> 00:59.500
...where you envision your business going.

00:59.850 --> 01:04.450
If you need any more information on this subject or any other subject in the business field,...
