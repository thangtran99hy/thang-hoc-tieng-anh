00:06.450 --> 00:07.450
The war is over.

00:07.700 --> 00:10.400
You know, most of us have given up most of our privacy already.

00:10.500 --> 00:14.300
If you are giving all of your financial disclosures online,...

00:14.400 --> 00:16.350
...your credit card, your social security and so forth,...

00:16.850 --> 00:22.300
...I think the way we protect those things can afford us the ability to protect our medical records as well.

00:22.750 --> 00:24.200
It's moving in this direction.

00:24.300 --> 00:27.950
In fact, one would say there is almost a moral obligation for people...

00:28.000 --> 00:31.550
...to begin to disclose at least a portion of their medical records online...

00:31.900 --> 00:34.950
...because it's only through that disclosure on a large scale,...

00:35.650 --> 00:44.350
...whether it's your, not necessarily your name and identity, but at least your phenotypical data and your genomic data...

00:44.800 --> 00:49.650
...will allow us to create a whole revolution in personalized preventative medicine...

00:50.100 --> 00:53.500
...which I think is extraordinarily important for the next few decades.

00:55.700 --> 00:59.150
We are testing what it is like to lose privacy now.

00:59.400 --> 01:03.150
The loss of privacy inherent in these technologies...

01:03.200 --> 01:11.250
...is a precursor to an almost biological or extrasensory loss of privacy that will come as the species evolves.

01:11.350 --> 01:16.900
Shame that could be used to control us will no longer be able to control us...

01:17.000 --> 01:19.850
...because we'll find out that everybody masturbates...

01:19.950 --> 01:24.250
...or everybody has this kind of sex with their spouse...

01:24.350 --> 01:27.450
...or eats this kind of food or picks their nose and does whatever.

01:27.650 --> 01:30.850
A lot of taboo won't be taboo anymore...

01:30.950 --> 01:36.550
...and that which is truly taboo will kind of rise to the surface in a way...

01:36.600 --> 01:40.250
...and we'll see, "Well, we all can kind of agree that we don't wanna do this".

01:40.300 --> 01:46.250
If the species survives, we'll develop that sort of organismic capability...

01:46.300 --> 01:48.900
...and we won't be able to be embarrassed by that stuff anymore.
