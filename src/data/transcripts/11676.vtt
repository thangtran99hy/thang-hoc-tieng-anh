Neal Browne with Bill Decker and Awful Deals. What is that?

00:04.500 --> 00:06.600
Awful Deals is a site that I created,...

00:07.000 --> 00:12.400
...really so that people could post and complain and learn from awful business deals that they've seen.

00:12.600 --> 00:14.200
What kind of things are they gonna see on this?

00:14.250 --> 00:16.050
They're gonna see bad customer service.

00:16.100 --> 00:19.000
They're gonna see awful customer service, if I could rather say.

00:19.050 --> 00:20.800
They're gonna see awful merchandise for sale.

00:21.350 --> 00:22.300
We have an awful newsletter.

00:23.100 --> 00:26.350
If you contact us, we may not contact you because we're in an awful mood.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.200
We're gonna see all kinds of awful offerings, awful investments, awful sales, awful business pitches.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.650
And hopefully, beyond the laughter, someone can actually read these things and learn from them and say,...

00:37.800 --> 00:39.200
..."Maybe I won't repeat that mistake."

00:39.550 --> 00:41.200
So, it's not for rent, but for rant?

00:41.350 --> 00:43.300
It's not for rent, but for rant and rant is on it.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.400
That's your joke, I stole that. I couldn't.

00:47.300 --> 00:48.700
And you can buy Awful merchandise.

00:48.900 --> 00:52.100
There's Awful coffee cups and Awful underwear, and Awful t-shirts.

00:52.250 --> 00:53.850
So, this is somebody who's in a bad mood,...

00:53.900 --> 00:56.300
...they may wanna get in a better mood, so they go read the Awful site.

00:56.450 --> 00:58.800
Exactly, and I thought it would be the perfect gag gift.

00:59.100 --> 01:02.050
Imagine you go to the office and then say, "Here. Here's your Awful Deals coffee mug."...

01:02.100 --> 01:03.350
...or "Here's your Awful Deals t-shirt."

01:03.550 --> 01:04.150
That could be funny.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.850
If you have no sense of humor, then it's an awful customer. We don't want them.

01:08.050 --> 01:09.800
That's right and don't visit the Awful site.
