How do you create relationships online when you're just starting to court each other?

00:14.900 --> 00:18.650
So, let me think about the ways that I would maybe connect with someone that I didn't know already.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.100
First of all, absolutely critical that you read their profile...

00:23.700 --> 00:26.550
...because you have to make sure when you send a message that it's personal.

00:27.050 --> 00:29.800
Nobody wants to see a message that looks like it's been cut and pasted in...

00:29.900 --> 00:31.800
...so I would look at someone's profile.

00:31.850 --> 00:34.100
Every profile has something interesting to say...

00:34.500 --> 00:35.868
...and I would say something like,...

00:36.153 --> 00:40.249
"I really enjoyed the blog you wrote on the 24th of March about such and such a subject."

00:40.450 --> 00:44.500
"I'd be interested to hear what happened to you after that blog went out."...

00:45.150 --> 00:50.050
...or "I see you've got a network of 40 people, but you've managed to achieve 12 testimonials."...

00:50.300 --> 00:53.200
..."I'd love to learn from you because that's a fantastic achievement."...

00:53.600 --> 00:58.600
...or "I've just seen a photograph on your profile of a place you went on holiday."

00:58.900 --> 01:00.300
"Did you have a great time?"

01:05.900 --> 01:08.250
"What kind of sort of holiday do you plan to take next year?"

01:08.650 --> 01:11.600
Something sort of showing an interest in their profile.

01:12.350 --> 01:17.400
Pick out things that they do in their business that undoubtedly would be of interest to you.

01:17.700 --> 01:22.300
I mean, most people are in business all doing similar sorts of things,...

01:22.350 --> 01:26.550
...you know, even if you're a graphic designer, accountancy is gonna be important to you;...

01:26.900 --> 01:28.750
...property development is going to be important to you.

01:29.100 --> 01:32.650
Pick out something in their profile that's of interest to you as well...

01:33.000 --> 01:37.600
...and so make sure that you at all times personalize the way that you talk to someone...

01:37.950 --> 01:42.900
...and 100% if you show an interest in somebody, they will show an interest back in you.
