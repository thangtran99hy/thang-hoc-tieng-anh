The 800-year-old city of Munich is a major international business center.

00:06.843 --> 00:09.579
Munich was once known as the German Rome.

00:09.977 --> 00:14.261
It's the third largest city in Germany and the capital of the State of Bavaria.

00:14.999 --> 00:17.735
Munich's history dates back to the 9th century,...

00:18.042 --> 00:21.335
...but during World War II, some 60% of it was bombed.

00:21.709 --> 00:25.266
Since then, it's been re-created along the same architectural lines...

00:25.500 --> 00:26.851
...and it's been done so well,...

00:27.025 --> 00:29.669
...it's hard to tell the difference between the old and the new.

00:30.212 --> 00:32.809
The city is marked with regal squares and streets...

00:32.884 --> 00:35.682
...and magnificent residences, parks, and gardens.

00:36.053 --> 00:38.915
The heart of Munich is located in the city's center.

00:42.015 --> 00:43.485
Here in Marienplatz,...

00:43.635 --> 00:47.826
...royal weddings and public executions took place centuries ago.

00:48.181 --> 00:50.511
Today, the area that surrounds the city hall...

00:50.655 --> 00:53.979
...is more characterized by sidewalk cafes and shops.

00:54.771 --> 00:57.612
The squares themselves are venues for entertainment...

00:57.741 --> 01:00.539
...with free browsing for enthusiasts of art and music.

01:07.993 --> 01:11.937
A tourist information booth is located at the city hall in Marienplatz.

01:12.254 --> 01:15.221
Get detailed maps and information on the many attractions...

01:15.435 --> 01:18.543
...including museums that have some of the best collections in Europe.

01:19.660 --> 01:21.647
Another lovely escape into history...

01:21.736 --> 01:24.486
...is to the exquisite gardens of the Nymphenburg Palace,...

01:24.685 --> 01:27.514
...once the summer residence of Bavarian sovereigns.
