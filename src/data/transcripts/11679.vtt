00:02.360 --> 00:07.570
I was born into a rich family. I enjoyed work and liked people to think well of me.

00:08.270 --> 00:11.440
Everybody was certain that I had a good future ahead of me.

00:12.010 --> 00:15.840
My biggest fault was that I enjoyed the pleasures of life too much.

00:16.480 --> 00:19.750
I wanted people to think I was serious and a very good person...

00:19.950 --> 00:21.750
...that did not do anything bad.

00:22.220 --> 00:24.690
Because of this, I hid my pleasures.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.950
When I was old enough to think about what I was doing,...

00:28.090 --> 00:30.560
...I realized that I was living a double life.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.590
I began to study science.

00:33.090 --> 00:36.800
After a few years, I began to realize that a man is not one person.

00:37.030 --> 00:38.100
He is two people.

00:38.900 --> 00:41.840
I was usually the serious man who did good things.

00:42.240 --> 00:45.740
The man who lived for pleasure was a dream that I could not always follow.

00:46.310 --> 00:50.350
I began to think about the possibility of the two people being separate.

00:50.780 --> 00:55.450
I tried to find a chemical that would help me make one of my spirits stronger than the other.

00:55.950 --> 00:58.590
One night, I put the chemicals together in a glass.

00:58.950 --> 01:02.120
They boiled and changed color. I drank the mixture.

01:02.720 --> 01:06.560
I immediately felt very sick. Everything in my body hurt.

01:07.330 --> 01:09.230
I did not know what would happen to me.

01:09.800 --> 01:13.500
Then, the pain began to go away, and I stopped feeling sick.

01:14.040 --> 01:17.510
I felt different. Then I realized that I was shorter.

01:18.170 --> 01:21.480
I wanted to see myself. Did I really look different?
