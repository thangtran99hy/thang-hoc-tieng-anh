00:03.200 --> 00:06.740
Captain Nemo and I walked away from the Nautilus in our diving suits.

00:07.070 --> 00:12.040
It was very dark, except for a red light glowing about two miles away.

00:12.710 --> 00:16.010
I saw piles of stones as the red light grew stronger.

00:16.680 --> 00:21.720
Then, I saw a white light on top of a mountain. The red light came from behind it.

00:22.280 --> 00:25.420
I followed Captain Nemo as he began to climb up the mountain,...

00:25.790 --> 00:27.620
...which was covered in dead trees.

00:28.390 --> 00:30.430
I noticed that some of them were pines.

00:31.260 --> 00:33.290
How did they grow here, under the sea?

00:33.860 --> 00:36.500
As we climbed higher, the path became more difficult.

00:36.730 --> 00:40.740
We came to some large caves and I saw giant crabs and lobsters in them.

00:41.400 --> 00:42.940
I wanted to stop and study them,...

00:43.410 --> 00:46.670
...but Captain Nemo continued to climb, and I had to follow him.

00:47.340 --> 00:51.950
We came to a wide flat area where I saw the ruins of buildings covered in seaweed.

00:52.650 --> 00:56.650
Still the captain did not stop, and we climbed to the top of the mountain.

00:57.250 --> 00:58.350
It was a volcano.

00:59.420 --> 01:03.320
The red light came from lava flowing down the other side of the mountain.

01:03.990 --> 01:06.860
Below it, I could see an entirely ruined city.

01:07.500 --> 01:14.140
Captain Nemo took a piece of white rock and scratched a word on a black rock: Atlantis.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.410
This was the ancient city that the Greek historians wrote about.

01:18.870 --> 01:22.210
It had been destroyed by earthquakes and sunk below the sea.
