00:03.330 --> 00:04.800
A man had two daughters.

00:05.470 --> 00:08.870
One was married to a farmer, and the other to a brick maker.

00:09.740 --> 00:12.310
The man wanted to give one wish to each daughter.

00:12.910 --> 00:15.080
He went to the daughter who had married the farmer,...

00:15.540 --> 00:18.380
...and asked how she was and if there was anything she needed.

00:19.050 --> 00:22.080
The daughter said, "Everything is fine father."

00:22.720 --> 00:28.390
"I only have one wish. I wish that it will rain so that my husband's plants will grow."

00:29.190 --> 00:32.560
The man then went to visit the daughter who had married the brick maker.

00:33.290 --> 00:37.070
He also asked her how she was, and if there was anything she needed.

00:37.900 --> 00:40.770
She replied, "I have everything I need...

00:41.100 --> 00:46.540
..."except that I want many fine days so that the sun will dry the bricks my husband has made."

00:47.410 --> 00:48.710
The father then told her,...

00:49.340 --> 00:51.880
"I don't know what to wish for the two of you."

00:52.350 --> 00:56.020
"Your sister wants rain, and you want dry, sunny weather."

00:56.790 --> 00:59.920
"Whatever I wish for, it will not please one of you."
