00:02.749 --> 00:03.497
Are you hungry?

00:03.845 --> 00:04.850
Yes, I am.

00:05.103 --> 00:07.102
I feel like having something sweet.

00:07.599 --> 00:09.300
Do you know Blue Moon Cafe?

00:09.606 --> 00:10.901
They have great chocolate cake.

00:11.257 --> 00:12.551
I know that cafe.

00:12.797 --> 00:14.706
But I think it's too expensive.

00:14.955 --> 00:17.398
Really? I thought it wasn't that expensive.

00:17.806 --> 00:20.048
I'm sure you forgot your last date.

00:20.296 --> 00:22.604
You complained about the price, remember?

00:23.000 --> 00:24.294
Oh, you're right.

00:24.463 --> 00:25.590
Now, I remember.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.101
The price was insane.

00:27.401 --> 00:28.953
Let's go to another cafeteria.

00:29.301 --> 00:29.900
Okay.
