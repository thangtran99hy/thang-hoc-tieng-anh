Happiness is obviously something of great importance to us especially at this time of the year.

00:08.361 --> 00:10.717
When it comes to the question, "Are you happy?"',...

00:11.173 --> 00:13.315
...it always takes me a few moments to answer.

00:13.803 --> 00:18.218
I realize that happiness doesn't just reside in my head, like contentment,...

00:18.699 --> 00:20.447
...but it pervades the entire body.

00:20.893 --> 00:25.252
So, when I say I'm happy, this means that I'm mentally and physically happy,...

00:25.669 --> 00:29.721
...and we shouldn't take it for granted that health is the key component of happiness.

00:30.127 --> 00:36.084
True. How many people actually feel thankful about what they have or just the way they are? 

00:36.506 --> 00:38.745
We all should be happy about what we have.

00:39.105 --> 00:40.849
Good physical and mental health,...

00:41.228 --> 00:46.419
...a family, shelter, our country, food, and the list goes on and on.

00:46.830 --> 00:49.296
Let me tell you something that you might already know.

00:49.707 --> 00:52.047
There is a movie called, "The Pursuit of Happyness."

00:52.558 --> 00:56.681
Here, the word "Happyness" with a "y" is not misspelled,...

00:57.031 --> 01:01.249
...but it is intended to show that the true meaning of happiness is being happy.

01:01.902 --> 01:04.479
The spelling of the word is not actually important.

01:04.904 --> 01:06.080
I can guarantee you.

01:06.648 --> 01:11.364
I think that there are some conditions that need to exist in order to be truly happy.

01:11.836 --> 01:17.648
Like you said, "Basic needs such as a good, supportive family, country, a healthy body,"...

01:18.031 --> 01:19.917
..."a place to live and things to eat,"...

01:20.296 --> 01:23.521
..."knowing yourself, what you like, and what you are good at,...

01:23.623 --> 01:26.117
...so you can set realistic goals in life."
