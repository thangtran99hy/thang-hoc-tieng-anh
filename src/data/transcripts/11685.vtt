Many English names have nicknames, I figure,...

00:05.450 --> 00:08.502
...or people usually shorten the name when calling a person.

00:08.801 --> 00:11.155
Let's see if I can come up with good examples,...

00:11.602 --> 00:17.555
...Bill and William, Rob and Robert, Sam and Samuel, and of course, Alex and Alexander.

00:17.949 --> 00:20.209
Does your name have a particular meaning to it?

00:20.604 --> 00:21.599
Who gave you that name?

00:21.842 --> 00:24.002
I believe my grandfather named me Alex.

00:24.451 --> 00:27.103
You know, Alexander is a common male first name,...

00:27.557 --> 00:30.550
...and this English name is taken from the Latin "Alexander,"...

00:30.805 --> 00:32.499
...which means, "a protector of man."

00:33.095 --> 00:34.999
Yes, it's a warrior-like name.

00:35.690 --> 00:38.603
I wish I had a very unique name like "Condoleezza Rice".

00:39.099 --> 00:40.549
Do you know how she got her name?

00:41.112 --> 00:45.053
Her mom fashioned the name from the Italian term "con dolcezza"...

00:45.501 --> 00:49.500
...from a musical score that instructs the performer to play "with sweetness."

00:49.744 --> 00:50.408
How nice!

00:50.857 --> 00:53.407
Yeah, if you have a unique name like her,...

00:53.698 --> 00:56.301
...it will make other people remember you better, I guess.

00:56.692 --> 01:00.396
Don't get me wrong, but I always get confused with English names.

01:00.802 --> 01:03.496
It's really hard to match a person with his or her name.

01:03.903 --> 01:04.950
They are all common.

01:05.348 --> 01:10.056
Some Korean people still visit a shaman or a fortune teller for a newborn baby's name,...

01:10.500 --> 01:13.853
...because of a strong belief that the name could change one's life.
