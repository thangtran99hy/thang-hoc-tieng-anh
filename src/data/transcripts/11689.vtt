00:19.236 --> 00:23.498
It took 30,000 tons of snow and about 500 tons of ice...

00:23.592 --> 00:25.145
...to make the Ice Hotel in Quebec.

00:25.665 --> 00:28.799
These days, about 100,000 people a year will visit the hotel,...

00:29.162 --> 00:33.119
...but about 5,000 have the nerve to spend the entire night.

00:33.965 --> 00:36.486
You'll get complete instructions on what to wear...

00:36.585 --> 00:38.988
...and how to use the extra strength sleeping bag.

00:39.931 --> 00:44.724
A few common areas include crystalline halls, a slide, and a coffee shop.

00:45.501 --> 00:49.516
One of the most stunning aspects of the Ice Hotel is this chapel here.

00:49.833 --> 00:52.053
Some 40 couples got married here this year.

00:52.501 --> 00:53.789
Imagine the wardrobe.

00:54.639 --> 00:57.315
The place where everyone goes is to the Ice Bar,...

00:57.536 --> 01:00.392
...where unique beverages are served up in ice glasses.

01:00.803 --> 01:03.859
It's like being dropped onto the set of a science fiction movie...

01:04.097 --> 01:08.185
...and animated visitors are finding all sorts of ways to keep warm...

01:08.305 --> 01:10.318
...while enjoying the unique ambience.

01:12.735 --> 01:15.905
In the daytime, before the overnight guests check in,...

01:16.048 --> 01:18.042
...visitors can tour all of the rooms.

01:18.233 --> 01:21.556
Many of which are artistically carved along a special theme.

01:22.265 --> 01:24.161
One suite is like a crystal palace...

01:24.370 --> 01:26.258
...and another is called the mermaid room.

01:27.177 --> 01:30.451
All of the ice block beds are covered in a piece of faux fur...

01:30.765 --> 01:34.053
...and a colorful fiber-optic lighting creates a surreal touch.

01:35.228 --> 01:37.085
Open for three months of the year,...

01:37.376 --> 01:41.123
...the enigmatic Ice Hotel is about a forty-minute drive from Quebec City.
