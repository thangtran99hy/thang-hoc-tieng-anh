Oscar's statuette awarded to a producer of "The King's Speech"...

00:04.691 --> 00:08.205
...has been badly damaged when a toddler dropped it at a party.

00:08.595 --> 00:12.410
15-month-old Lara Egan was holding the Academy Award when this happened.

00:15.548 --> 00:19.603
The Oscar ended up with several dents and some of the gold plating was chipped off.

00:19.901 --> 00:21.951
But luckily, Academy bosses are forgiving.

00:22.253 --> 00:25.211
A lovely lady came out with gloves on,...

00:26.587 --> 00:29.994
...took our award away and came back and it was all repaired within 15 minutes.

00:30.659 --> 00:35.200
The crew's forgiven little Lara but will be much more careful with the Oscar in the future.
