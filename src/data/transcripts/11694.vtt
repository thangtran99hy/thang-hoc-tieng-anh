This is George Takei.

00:16.555 --> 00:23.002
Days ago, we watched in collective horror as the earth shook and the waters rose in Japan.

00:23.752 --> 00:25.453
Thousands lost their lives.

00:25.794 --> 00:28.652
Many thousands more are still unaccounted for.

00:29.192 --> 00:35.646
And countless remain without food, clean water, shelter or power in the bitter winter.

00:38.095 --> 00:40.604
Today, we must act with collective resolve.

00:41.398 --> 00:43.447
In Japanese, we say, "gaman".

00:44.050 --> 00:47.607
It means, "to endure with fortitude and dignity".

00:48.109 --> 00:51.897
In the spirit of "gaman", I ask you for help today.

01:07.041 --> 01:12.906
Even small amounts, given with great amounts of heart, can make a real difference.

01:18.890 --> 01:22.501
At times like this, we are all Japanese.

01:25.207 --> 01:25.601
Thank you.
