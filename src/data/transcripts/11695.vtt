00:09.153 --> 00:13.398
It is the good news story that the Japanese people have been craving.

00:13.788 --> 00:17.149
An 80 - year - old woman and her 16 - year - old grandson...

00:17.398 --> 00:21.993
...found alive in the wreckage of their house in Ishinomaki, Miyagi prefecture.

00:22.456 --> 00:26.249
Local media reports they survived by eating yoghurt from the fridge.

00:26.794 --> 00:29.487
Eventually, the boy managed to break through to the roof.

00:29.847 --> 00:32.255
Rescue workers spotted him waving for help.

00:32.902 --> 00:37.595
They have survived nine nights of freezing temperatures and heavy snow.

00:38.053 --> 00:41.753
The boy is reported to have a low temperature but is conscious.

00:42.304 --> 00:44.900
It will reinvigorate the rescue effort here.

00:45.258 --> 00:51.509
For days, Japanese and international teams have searched up and down this wrecked coastline in vain.

00:52.154 --> 00:57.597
But for most families, the desperate search for loved ones goes on or ends in tragedy.

00:59.847 --> 01:05.349
Miyagi police say 15,000 people probably died in their prefecture alone.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.800
Here in Natori, close to Sendai city,...

01:09.105 --> 01:12.902
...the body of a teenage boy is left on the side of the embankment.

01:13.396 --> 01:18.258
A nameless corpse yet to be collected and taken to the overwhelmed morgue.

01:18.907 --> 01:23.097
Rescuers say there are many more bodies among the wreckage of this town.

01:23.653 --> 01:27.303
The rest of the missing, they say, were probably washed out to sea.

01:28.150 --> 01:32.459
Natori was on the front line when the tsunami smashed into the shoreline.

01:32.902 --> 01:37.497
Anyone who had not escaped this flat coastal plain had little chance.
