Hello! Welcome to Michael's Better Business English.

00:04.596 --> 00:07.993
This month, we're looking at how to make polite requests.

00:08.490 --> 00:12.107
Here, there are two key areas: culture and language.

00:12.745 --> 00:13.799
First, culture.

00:14.655 --> 00:18.458
Often, Japanese business people prefer this indirect style;...

00:18.907 --> 00:21.603
...giving hints, rather than speaking directly.

00:22.347 --> 00:23.703
However, be careful.

00:24.153 --> 00:28.900
In western business culture, we prefer to make direct requests;...

00:29.196 --> 00:31.054
...clear and easy to understand.

00:32.095 --> 00:34.951
Of course though, you must use polite English.

00:35.708 --> 00:38.905
Here, there are three levels of polite English for requesting.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.458
First one, respectful.

00:42.255 --> 00:46.646
Respectful is for clients, customers or senior members of your company.

00:47.602 --> 00:52.106
Here, we often use expressions like, "Would you," or "May I do something?"

00:53.646 --> 00:55.598
Second level, businesslike.

00:56.301 --> 01:00.705
This is more commonly used with co-workers or people you often work with.

01:01.455 --> 01:04.952
Here, we often use expressions like, "Could you," or "Can you?"

01:05.644 --> 01:08.953
For example, "Could you reschedule the meeting to the 10th?"

01:10.756 --> 01:12.951
Finally, the last level, casual.

01:13.897 --> 01:16.453
This should be used with close friends and family.

01:17.295 --> 01:19.296
Here, we often use expressions like, "Will you?"

01:20.049 --> 01:22.293
For example, "Will you close the door?"

01:23.448 --> 01:25.356
Do be careful with this expression though.

01:26.691 --> 01:29.391
This can sound a little bit angry...

01:29.954 --> 01:32.595
...with the feeling, "Why haven't you done this earlier?"

01:33.350 --> 01:35.856
For example, "Will you send me the report?"...

01:36.198 --> 01:39.607
...might feel like "Why haven't you sent me the report already?"

01:40.351 --> 01:42.600
So, only use this with close friends and family.

01:43.653 --> 01:47.294
So, use this advice to make polite requests.

01:47.954 --> 01:49.199
Thank you and good luck!
