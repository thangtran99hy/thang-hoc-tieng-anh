00:00.414 --> 00:04.853
I think it's just a universal human desire to want to think,...

00:05.215 --> 00:07.458
..."I have done something decent with my life,...

00:07.949 --> 00:09.809
...I'm doing something important with my life."

00:11.491 --> 00:14.259
And for me, this is what makes human beings very interesting...

00:15.152 --> 00:19.572
...because I think cows seem to be quite happy...

00:19.662 --> 00:24.545
...to just eat the grass and kinda reproduce and die,...

00:24.646 --> 00:26.372
...a perfectly good life for a cow.

00:27.043 --> 00:29.363
We're very strange because that's not enough for us.

00:31.530 --> 00:34.765
You know, whatever it is we're doing we need to say we're good at it.

00:36.871 --> 00:37.720
We've done our best.

00:38.855 --> 00:44.833
Even criminals have to say, you know, I'm a good gangster or I'm tough and strong,...

00:45.124 --> 00:46.495
...you know, I'm loyal to my gang.

00:49.228 --> 00:52.295
Everyone seems to need to tell themselves that and if they can't,...

00:53.351 --> 00:55.290
...I think they lose this sense of dignity.

00:56.313 --> 01:00.049
And so for me the concept of dignity, I think, has been key...

01:00.191 --> 01:02.673
...in the way I've always thought about people.

01:05.119 --> 01:10.260
In the West, people always use this expression about Japanese people losing face.

01:10.946 --> 01:12.215
I've never understood this.

01:15.844 --> 01:20.050
In the West, people seem to think this is a peculiar concept to Japan.

01:20.147 --> 01:22.277
Well at least to Japan, China, or something.

01:23.756 --> 01:28.651
To me, it's exactly the same as what I see in the West.

01:29.973 --> 01:36.105
It's not losing face, it's losing dignity, and people want to be treated in a dignified way.

01:36.187 --> 01:41.127
If you take away their dignity, they'll do desperate things to try and get it back.

01:43.005 --> 01:47.072
But I find that aspect of human behavior very, very interesting,...

01:47.631 --> 01:51.720
...and sometimes it's sad, but, on the whole, I respect it.

01:54.484 --> 01:56.490
I mean, yes, both of these books I think...

01:57.555 --> 02:01.221
...these people will find themselves almost trapped in very limited lives.

02:02.135 --> 02:05.189
One of their solutions about what to do in this situation is...

02:06.023 --> 02:09.800
...to somehow try to find some meaning in dignity in the position they're in,...

02:10.153 --> 02:12.827
...because the other thing they're trying to do is find love and friendship.
