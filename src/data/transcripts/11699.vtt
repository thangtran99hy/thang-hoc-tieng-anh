Hi! My name's Peter Ash.

00:04.230 --> 00:06.570
I came up with the idea for my GCSE project.

00:06.670 --> 00:09.970
Got home one night, my sister's hamster is running around the wheel.

00:10.110 --> 00:14.410
So, I went back to college and I came up with the hamster - powered mobile phone charger.

00:15.310 --> 00:18.380
So, it's quite simple really. You have a hamster running around on the wheel...

00:18.510 --> 00:20.320
...and then it goes through to this gearing system.

00:20.980 --> 00:23.850
It goes through this circuitry, and then it charges your mobile phone.

00:26.090 --> 00:31.290
I did have, once in America, an email saying,  "Could you generate a bigger version for my horse?".

00:34.230 --> 00:36.260
You need a hell of a lot to power a house.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.200
It's really not practical and the mess you've got to clear up afterward as well.
