Intel Anti - Theft Technology includes built-in intelligence that detects potential theft situations...

00:11.246 --> 00:13.649
...and responds according to a set IT policy.

00:14.701 --> 00:18.171
For example, if an unauthorized user tries to change the BIOS...

00:18.294 --> 00:19.735
...or the firmware of the PC,...

00:19.961 --> 00:23.059
...or if the notebook is not rendezvoused with the central security server...

00:23.141 --> 00:24.511
...within a predetermined interval,...

00:24.750 --> 00:28.198
...a hardware - based local timer will expire and trigger a response.

00:31.195 --> 00:33.359
Or if the number of failed log in attempts...

00:33.457 --> 00:36.255
...in a pre - OS screen reaches a policy - based limit,...

00:37.097 --> 00:40.158
...it also triggers a response that can stop the OS from booting...

00:40.446 --> 00:43.651
...or deletes important encryption keys, disabling data access.

00:45.497 --> 00:47.849
If a user calls me to report a stolen notebook,...

00:47.985 --> 00:49.607
...I simply flag it in our database.

00:50.654 --> 00:53.601
Synchronization occurs whenever the notebook connects to the Internet.

00:54.598 --> 00:58.597
When that happens, a poison pill can be sent, rendering the notebook inoperable.

01:00.199 --> 01:01.851
If the PC is 3G - enabled,...

01:02.087 --> 01:06.185
...it can quickly receive a poison pill via an encrypted SMS message.

01:07.292 --> 01:11.946
3G connections can now occur out-of-band, without OS or BIOS dependencies,...

01:12.050 --> 01:15.607
...significantly reducing the window of time to respond to PC theft.

01:18.850 --> 01:23.901
The poison pill can delete the encryption keys and user credentials required to access data on the hard drive.

01:25.497 --> 01:30.087
And because Intel Anti - Theft Technology enables that data to be stored in the chipset,...

01:30.344 --> 01:31.748
...our data is fully protected,...

01:32.288 --> 01:36.257
...even if someone who knew the credentials tries to access the hard drive on another PC.

01:37.291 --> 01:41.850
Thieves or disgruntled employees have no means of unlocking the data on the hard drive.

01:42.847 --> 01:46.899
Both the PC and the hard drive data become completely useless when disabled.

01:48.154 --> 01:54.740
A new "Location on Demand" feature enables me to query the GPS coordinates of the missing PC via the 3G connection.

01:57.148 --> 02:01.951
