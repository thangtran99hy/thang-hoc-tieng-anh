00:08.198 --> 00:10.558
Left unchecked, we have every reason to believe...

00:10.638 --> 00:13.808
...that Gadhafi would commit atrocities against his people.

00:15.204 --> 00:16.347
Many thousands could die.

00:17.995 --> 00:19.804
A humanitarian crisis would ensue.

00:21.197 --> 00:25.648
The entire region could be destabilized, endangering many of our allies and partners.

00:26.443 --> 00:30.597
President Obama says Mr. Gadhafi's troops must stop attacking civilians,...

00:30.843 --> 00:33.851
...halt military action against Benghazi and other cities,...

00:34.098 --> 00:37.697
...and allow humanitarian supplies to reach the civilian population.

00:38.357 --> 00:40.450
These terms are not subject to negotiation.

00:41.047 --> 00:43.090
If Gadhafi does not comply with the resolution,...

00:43.649 --> 00:46.442
...the international community will impose consequences,...

00:47.303 --> 00:50.103
...and the resolution will be enforced through military action.

00:51.051 --> 00:55.601
Mr. Obama made no reference to Mr. Gadhafi's offer Friday of a ceasefire.

00:56.052 --> 00:59.054
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appeared skeptical.

00:59.495 --> 01:04.254
The first and overwhelmingly urgent action is to end the violence...

01:04.404 --> 01:17.693
...and we have to see a very clear set of decisions that are operationalized on the ground by Gadhafi's forces...

01:18.002 --> 01:24.305
...to move physically a significant distance away from the east,...

01:24.395 --> 01:29.003
...where they have been pursuing their campaign against the opposition.

01:29.193 --> 01:36.503
Clinton says a no-fly zone over Libya would involve bombing targets like anti - aircraft missiles and radar installations.

01:37.046 --> 01:40.999
She says Mr. Gadhafi has lost his legitimacy and must relinquish power.

01:41.254 --> 01:52.049
We do believe that a final result of any negotiations would have to be the decision by Colonel Gadhafi to leave.

01:52.399 --> 01:54.597
But let's take this one step at a time.

01:55.148 --> 02:00.055
The United States does not support the direct intervention of ground troops into the conflict...

02:00.347 --> 02:04.601
...but the U.S. Navy now has considerable assets just off the Libyan coast.

02:05.087 --> 02:08.346
A no-fly zone over Libya is supported by the Arab League...

02:08.705 --> 02:14.447
...and U.S. officials say Arab governments must play a central role in any military action against Libya.

02:15.149 --> 02:17.752
