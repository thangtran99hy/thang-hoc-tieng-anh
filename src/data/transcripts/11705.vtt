My name is Bobby Ray, the artist known as B.o.B.

00:08.641 --> 00:11.470
Basically, I make good vibrations for the masses across the globe.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.780
My music style in three words or less: from outer space.

00:18.380 --> 00:20.320
A lot of things inspire me, like, it comes from everywhere.

00:21.020 --> 00:24.020
The highest point of my music career thus far: releasing my first album.

00:24.850 --> 00:27.890
You know for me, like, it's just finally getting over that first step.

00:28.120 --> 00:31.530
The lowest point for me was probably getting booed at my high school talent show.

00:31.998 --> 00:34.400
It was the lowest point for me, but it was the best...

00:34.950 --> 00:39.130
...because that's what gave me the fire that I needed to, you know, get back up.
