00:00.402 --> 00:06.592
So, how else to talk about 2010 and Q4 as a phenomenal ending...

00:06.889 --> 00:08.901
...to a very good year at Google? 

00:09.856 --> 00:15.105
I mean, our incredibly strong performance in Q4 and 2010 overall,...

00:15.501 --> 00:19.158
...I mean, is it really a testimonial to the fundamental trends in the digital economy?

00:20.705 --> 00:25.295
Those trends, they're fueling huge opportunities for innovation, for growth,...

00:25.501 --> 00:29.151
...both at Google but also in the entire ecosystem.

00:30.051 --> 00:34.302
One of these profound trends is the shift from advertising offline to online.

00:34.506 --> 00:37.096
And it continues at a quite a rapid clip.

00:37.596 --> 00:39.306
And, you know, you've seen it fueling growth...

00:39.500 --> 00:42.798
...both in our core search business, but across the board as well.

00:43.237 --> 00:50.003
A case in point is revenue growth is, in our core, accelerated strongly in the second half of 2010,...

00:50.285 --> 00:55.301
...which is really particularly impressive if you think about it, given that in 2-4-2009...

00:55.701 --> 00:58.403
...was itself a very strong quarter.

00:59.258 --> 01:05.950
So in addition, you know, investments in our newer businesses, the usual suspects of Display, Mobile, Enterprise;...

01:06.352 --> 01:09.955
...they are also, in parallel, creating a second powerful growth engine for Google.

01:10.894 --> 01:15.159
But at a high level, I just want to make it clear that how can we not be happy...

01:15.246 --> 01:18.094
...with the overall performance and trajectories of 2010...

01:18.457 --> 01:23.096
...and on that basis, be excited about our prospects for 2011 and beyond?

01:23.653 --> 01:27.150
So, let me turn for the specifics of the performance of the quarter now.

01:28.100 --> 01:29.047
Let's go through our results.

01:29.750 --> 01:34.055
Gross revenue, we grew 26% year-over-year to 8.4 billion.

01:35.003 --> 01:40.789
Our Google websites revenue was up 28% year-over-year to 5.7 billion. 

01:40.957 --> 01:44.996
And we saw strength across most major geographies and verticals. 

01:45.448 --> 01:49.154
Our AdSense revenue was up 22% year-over-year to 2.5,...

01:49.994 --> 01:52.902
...again, with continued strength in our Google Display Network,...

01:53.200 --> 01:56.502
...where other revenue was up 31% to 273 million.

01:57.299 --> 02:02.651
Our global aggregate paid - click growth was very strong, up 18% year-over-year...

02:03.102 --> 02:05.395
...and up 11% quarter over quarter.

02:06.999 --> 02:11.049
This is really reflecting, as I mentioned, the accelerating shift of offline to online.

02:11.511 --> 02:16.544
Without a doubt, as each year shows, there's more and more holiday shopping happening online.
