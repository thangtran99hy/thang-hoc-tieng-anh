00:00.200 --> 00:02.655
So, we certainly did have a great year at Google...

00:03.145 --> 00:08.704
...and I'd really like to think some of it stems from the unique way that we manage our product and engineering machine. 

00:09.392 --> 00:12.901
When we hire product managers, they often come in and they ask me, they say,...

00:13.159 --> 00:15.102
..."So, how do we measure success at Google?"

00:15.499 --> 00:16.745
And I always tell them, "It's simple"...

00:17.148 --> 00:21.302
..."At the end of the year, we make a list of all of your successes and your failures."...

00:21.701 --> 00:24.103
..."You're then measured on the sum of your successes"...

00:24.454 --> 00:26.243
..."and by how much you learned from your failures".

00:26.892 --> 00:28.700
So, at the beginning of 2010,...

00:29.099 --> 00:35.499
...one of our concerns was that as we scaled, this approach might lead to our being spread too thin.

00:36.154 --> 00:40.901
Instead, we thought, "Maybe we needed to put more wood behind fewer arrows".

00:41.289 --> 00:42.499
So, we made some changes.

00:42.901 --> 00:44.756
And I think they addressed this concern...

00:45.054 --> 00:51.504
...without actually affecting the basic philosophy of how we've always run product and engineering at Google.

00:51.841 --> 00:53.647
So, let's talk about what we changed.

00:54.097 --> 00:57.853
At the beginning of the year, we decided to double down on the core...

00:58.301 --> 01:00.306
...so that's search and search ads,...

01:00.799 --> 01:03.404
...and I think the financial numbers that you guys are seeing today,...

01:03.695 --> 01:06.098
...reflect the fact that that was a successful bet.

01:06.849 --> 01:08.202
But behind those numbers...

01:08.507 --> 01:12.357
...is a really relentless stream of new features and product innovations.
