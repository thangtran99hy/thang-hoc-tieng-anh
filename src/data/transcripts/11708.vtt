We made a big effort this year to make Search more interactive...

00:03.658 --> 00:05.447
...and you can see that with Google Instant.

00:05.946 --> 00:09.554
And then more recently, we made those previews instant as well.

00:10.246 --> 00:15.554
And earlier in the year, we launched new user interfaces for both web search and image search...

00:15.904 --> 00:17.796
...to make it easier and to make it more intuitive,...

00:18.051 --> 00:20.141
...to work with the results after you run a search. 

00:20.651 --> 00:23.292
And we're also making Search more intelligent. 

00:23.748 --> 00:25.712
We made several changes to results. 

00:26.100 --> 00:30.853
So now you can see things like a concert schedule or the answers to the questions...

00:31.099 --> 00:32.945
...highlighted right in the snippet. 

00:33.546 --> 00:36.056
And we're also now starting to roll out Place Search...

00:36.353 --> 00:41.795
...so when we know that you're looking for something that's in the neighborhood like an ice cream shop or something,...

00:42.101 --> 00:47.590
...we'll pull reviews, web pages, the address, and a photo altogether for you.

00:48.401 --> 00:51.095
We also doubled down on the ad side of the house.

00:51.547 --> 00:55.306
In the past year, we've launched several new ad formats which we've told you about,...

00:55.652 --> 00:57.751
...site links, seller rating ads.

00:57.953 --> 01:02.000
Recently, we just added this product listing ads with photos and prices.

01:02.754 --> 01:06.652
It makes sense that if I'm shopping for something like a coffee maker,...

01:07.052 --> 01:10.004
...it's helpful to see more information in the ad. 

01:10.647 --> 01:16.793
But the biggest boost of all came from good old-fashioned ads quality improvements.

01:17.348 --> 01:22.253
Q4 was our best quarter in years from a quality standpoint. 

01:22.848 --> 01:26.460
We launched over 20 updates which led to gains...

01:26.599 --> 01:31.255
...that were nearly double those that we would normally see in a strong quarter. 

01:31.904 --> 01:34.343
So although we've been at this for years,...

01:34.695 --> 01:39.397
...we're still finding lots and lots of ways to make ads better.
