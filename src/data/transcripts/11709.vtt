I'm gonna talk about the simple truth in leadership in the 21st century.

00:19.798 --> 00:22.474
In the 21st century, we need to actually look at,...

00:22.725 --> 00:24.987
...and what I'm gonna actually encourage you to consider today,...

00:25.361 --> 00:28.902
...is to go back to our school days when we learned how to count.

00:29.400 --> 00:32.211
But I actually think it's time for us to think about what we count...

00:32.716 --> 00:35.753
...because what we actually count truly counts.

00:36.444 --> 00:38.130
I guess I'm sort of a curious CEO.

00:38.647 --> 00:41.089
 I was also a curious economics major as an undergrad.

00:41.361 --> 00:46.141
And I learned that economists measure everything in tangible units of production...

00:46.491 --> 00:50.806
...and consumption as if each of those tangible units is exactly the same.

00:51.808 --> 00:52.717
They aren't the same.

00:53.534 --> 00:55.249
In fact, as leaders, what we need to learn...

00:55.644 --> 00:59.681
...is that we can actually influence the quality of that unit of production...

01:00.176 --> 01:03.728
...by actually creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling.

01:04.339 --> 01:09.947
In fact, in Vivian's case, her unit of production isn't the tangible hours she works.

01:10.489 --> 01:13.999
It's the intangible difference she makes during that one hour of work.

01:14.557 --> 01:18.341
This is Dave Arringdale who's actually been a longtime guest at Vivian's motel.

01:18.476 --> 01:21.955
He stayed there a hundred times in the last 20 years.

01:22.381 --> 01:25.205
And he's loyal to the property because of the relationship....

01:25.493 --> 01:27.808
...that Vivian and her fellow employees have created with him.

01:28.091 --> 01:30.981
They've created a habitat of happiness for Dave.

01:31.397 --> 01:38.374
And he tells me that he can always count on Vivian and the staff there to make him feel at home.

01:39.354 --> 01:45.991
Why is it that business leaders and investors quite often don't see the connection...

01:46.327 --> 01:49.745
...between creating the intangible of employee happiness...

01:50.599 --> 01:54.821
...with creating the tangible of financial profits in their business.

01:55.543 --> 02:00.783
We don't have to choose between inspired employees and sizable profits.

02:00.922 --> 02:01.704
We can have both.

02:02.147 --> 02:07.329
And in fact, inspired employees quite often help make sizable profits, right?

02:08.160 --> 02:11.051
So what the world needs now, in my opinion,...
