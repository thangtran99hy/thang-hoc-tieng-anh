00:05.630 --> 00:07.500
I lost everyone I've ever loved.

00:09.900 --> 00:11.140
Then, they locked me away...

00:13.710 --> 00:16.380
...with nowhere to hide from the pain.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.610
I need to get out. I'm gonna escape from here.

00:46.840 --> 00:50.710
There are armed guards everywhere and if Blue finds out, we're dead.

00:51.650 --> 00:52.710
We're already dead.

00:54.650 --> 01:01.260
You're afraid, don't be. To reach you're own paradise, just let go.

01:04.030 --> 01:07.600
What you're imagining right now, you control this world.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.670
What are you looking for?

01:14.770 --> 01:15.300
A way out.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.540
I'm going to help you to be free.

01:18.910 --> 01:22.680
You will need to find five items. The first is a map,...

01:23.410 --> 01:24.080
Take cover!

01:27.880 --> 01:28.620
...then fire,...

01:32.050 --> 01:32.890
...then a knife,...

01:38.090 --> 01:38.760
...and a key.

01:42.100 --> 01:43.930
The fifth thing is a mystery.

01:46.500 --> 01:50.210
Begin your journey. It will set you free.

01:58.410 --> 01:59.380
He knows what we're doing.

02:01.550 --> 02:03.050
It's the only way we can get out of here.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.630
If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything.
