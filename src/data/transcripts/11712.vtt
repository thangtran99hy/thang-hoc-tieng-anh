00:12.399 --> 00:13.203
This is Kerrigan.

00:13.501 --> 00:15.554
There is a wave of Zerg advancing on this position.

00:17.061 --> 00:18.360
We need immediate evac.

00:20.597 --> 00:22.659
What happened to Kerrigan wasn't your fault.

00:25.345 --> 00:26.457
Belay that order.

00:26.705 --> 00:27.709
We're moving out.

00:28.049 --> 00:30.249
What? You're not just gonna leave her!

00:32.310 --> 00:33.955
Vengeance doesn't factor into this.

00:34.454 --> 00:35.949
Our revolution is about freedom.

00:36.953 --> 00:38.558
When you figure it out, let us know.

00:39.310 --> 00:40.157
We're waiting on ya.

00:54.752 --> 00:56.408
Sir, Dominion ships warping in.

00:56.844 --> 00:59.188
Sweet mother of mercy!

00:59.498 --> 01:02.799
About time we kick this revolution into overdrive.

01:07.254 --> 01:09.307
Feels like old times already.

01:12.303 --> 01:15.550
The answers you seek lie within.

01:17.059 --> 01:21.461
Jim Raynor represents a clear and present threat to this Dominion.

01:22.396 --> 01:25.001
Prince Valerian, we have Zerg attack waves incoming.

01:27.501 --> 01:29.895
Kerrigan, what's she after?

01:30.148 --> 01:32.302
She's come to finish the job.

01:35.095 --> 01:38.911
Raynor, you're in way over your head.

01:39.744 --> 01:40.884
We'll see about that.

01:44.345 --> 01:47.498
Tell me why I shouldn't kill you right now.

01:47.804 --> 01:50.696
Because I can offer you what you've always wanted.

01:53.100 --> 01:55.950
If the Zerg wipe everyone out, it's all been for nothing.

01:56.610 --> 01:57.295
Stand your ground!

01:58.301 --> 01:59.994
So I'm going back to Char...

02:01.490 --> 02:02.755
...to get the job done.

02:03.352 --> 02:05.302
Now that's the commander I've been waiting on.

02:09.050 --> 02:11.096
Because the one thing I know,...

02:13.354 --> 02:16.197
...some things are just worth fighting for.
