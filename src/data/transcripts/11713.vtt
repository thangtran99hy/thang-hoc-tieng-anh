00:07.049 --> 00:10.395
I dare you to look at me and see only a statistic,...

00:11.900 --> 00:14.106
...someone you'll never meet.

00:16.542 --> 00:17.302
A tragedy,...

00:19.399 --> 00:20.201
...a commodity,...

00:22.456 --> 00:23.558
...a child bride.

00:26.293 --> 00:28.595
I dare you to look at me without pity,...

00:29.901 --> 00:30.550
...fatigue,...

00:32.055 --> 00:32.698
...dismissal.

00:36.201 --> 00:40.794
I dare you to look at me as more than a poster for your cause,...

00:43.356 --> 00:44.604
...a promise you want to keep.

00:48.450 --> 00:51.601
I dare you to look at me and see I'm the answer.

00:54.299 --> 00:58.347
I dare you to rethink what it means to look at a girl...

00:59.597 --> 01:00.753
...not a burden,...

01:01.351 --> 01:02.697
...not an object,...

01:05.302 --> 01:06.203
...but the answer.
