Discovery ended its 27 - year career Wednesday, with a smooth touchdown under clear skies.

00:15.654 --> 00:18.450
And nose gear touchdown, and the end of a historic journey.

00:19.294 --> 00:22.302
And to the ship that has led the way time and time again,...

00:22.691 --> 00:24.597
...we say, "Farewell, Discovery".

00:25.452 --> 00:29.894
Soon after landing, NASA officials, including administrator Charles Bolden...

00:30.406 --> 00:34.307
...and Kennedy Space Center Director Bob Cabana, thanked Discovery's six - member crew.

00:34.900 --> 00:38.206
If my numbers are correct, it's the 39th flight on Discovery.

00:39.700 --> 00:43.048
Discovery has a very special place for me and for Bob Cabana over here...

00:43.450 --> 00:45.994
...because we both had an opportunity to fly on it twice,...

00:46.498 --> 00:49.446
...and so this is very bittersweet for all of us.

00:50.100 --> 00:52.544
Discovery is the fleet's longest - serving shuttle.

00:52.998 --> 00:57.803
"It is in the same condition after its final landing, as it was after its first blastoff",...

00:58.000 --> 00:59.653
...said Mission Commander Steve Lindsey.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.354
And if you think about a vehicle that's 26 or 27 years old, been flying for that long,...

01:04.843 --> 01:06.053
...to come back perfect,...

01:06.349 --> 01:09.600
...I have never seen an airplane be able to do that.

01:10.397 --> 01:12.493
NASA is retiring its shuttle fleet this year,...

01:12.955 --> 01:14.095
...marking the end of an era.

01:14.653 --> 01:16.997
Charlie mentioned, it's a pretty bittersweet moment for all of us.

01:18.657 --> 01:22.698
As the minutes pass, I'm actually getting sadder and sadder about this being the last flight,...

01:23.000 --> 01:26.601
...and I know all the folks involved in the shuttle program feel the same way.

01:27.703 --> 01:29.356
Discovery will retire to a museum,...

01:29.708 --> 01:34.754
...after logging 238 million kilometers in space during its high-flying career.

01:35.951 --> 01:37.645
