I wanted to ask you first. Since this is an English learning magazine,...

00:07.040 --> 00:12.210
...I would like you to explain a bit, like you know, really simple like...

00:12.480 --> 00:16.700
...maybe kind of in half a minute or 1 minute.

00:16.850 --> 00:17.150
OK.

00:17.200 --> 00:17.950
Can you do that?

00:18.080 --> 00:18.310
Great!

00:22.720 --> 00:23.050
Great.

00:23.180 --> 00:23.420
Yeah.

00:23.520 --> 00:26.720
So I wrote this book, "What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20".

00:26.820 --> 00:30.860
It's initially inspired by my son who was going off to college.

00:31.230 --> 00:34.100
And the theme of the book is that problems are opportunities.

00:34.250 --> 00:35.860
The bigger the problem, the bigger the opportunity.

00:36.330 --> 00:40.100
And the book is about how you actually make things happen,...

00:40.970 --> 00:45.310
...how to challenge assumptions, break the rules, make your own luck,...

00:45.610 --> 00:49.180
...all the things you need to know to actually make your ideas come to life.

00:50.010 --> 00:55.450
OK great, and then so did you actually give this book to your son?

00:55.620 --> 00:58.690
I did. This book came out on his birthday. Can you believe that?

00:58.950 --> 01:02.420
The book came out on his birthday, just by accident.

01:02.660 --> 01:03.020
Really?

01:03.120 --> 01:05.360
The week he turned 20, the book came out.

01:05.460 --> 01:05.830
Wow.

01:06.590 --> 01:08.060
Isn't it wonderful? Yes, it was.

01:08.700 --> 01:11.870
Then of course that is a problem for what was I gonna do for his 21st birthday?

01:13.720 --> 01:14.170
Alright.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.870
I've made it bigger and bigger, right there.

01:18.910 --> 01:27.050
OK. And then what kind of comment did you hear first?

01:27.380 --> 01:30.320
"Oh, that was horrid". No, I'm kidding. I think he's very proud.

01:30.620 --> 01:34.290
He's really excited that the book is so popular here in Japan.
