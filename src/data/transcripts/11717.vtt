00:02.160 --> 00:07.170
My name is Robinson Crusoe, and I was born in 1632 in the city of York.

00:07.840 --> 00:11.240
My father gave me a good education and wanted me to be a lawyer.

00:11.940 --> 00:15.749
I didn't want to be a lawyer. I wanted to be a sailor and go to sea.

00:16.440 --> 00:18.310
My father was very angry with me.

00:18.850 --> 00:20.950
He asked me why I wanted to leave his house,...

00:21.380 --> 00:23.790
...where I would have an easy and comfortable life.

00:24.490 --> 00:26.650
I argued with my parents for another year.

00:27.190 --> 00:30.960
Then I went to Hull with a friend who was going to London on a ship.

00:31.960 --> 00:34.100
He invited me to go with him and I agreed.

00:35.160 --> 00:39.000
I did not ask my parents. I did not even tell them. I just went.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.140
I made a will, and soon we were ready to sail.

00:43.810 --> 00:45.310
The ship had sixteen men.

00:45.770 --> 00:49.510
We had good weather at first and sailed north along the coast of Brazil.

00:50.050 --> 00:55.020
However, as soon as we left the coast and headed toward Africa, there was a terrible storm.

00:55.620 --> 00:59.720
The wind blew the waves very high, but it also blew us toward the shore.

01:00.290 --> 01:03.360
We were certain that the big waves would smash the boat on the shore.

01:03.990 --> 01:09.760
Suddenly, an even larger wave turned the boat upside down, and we all fell into the wild sea.
