00:00.204 --> 00:07.261
Throughout history, coastlines around the world have been vulnerable to huge, destructive, ocean - crossing waves:...

00:07.669 --> 00:08.305
...Tsunamis.

00:09.097 --> 00:12.604
Even with the monitoring systems introduced in the 20th century,...

00:13.105 --> 00:15.698
...tsunamis often strike with little or no warning.

00:16.256 --> 00:19.752
Over the millennia, they have killed hundreds of thousands of people.

00:20.193 --> 00:24.603
From ancient Greece, pre - conquest North America, and feudal Japan...

00:24.754 --> 00:28.545
...to Alaska, India and Sri Lanka in modern times.

00:29.095 --> 00:32.411
They originate from volcanic eruptions, earthquakes,...

00:32.900 --> 00:36.244
...large landslides and even meteor impacts in the ocean.

00:37.254 --> 00:43.199
The energy released is comparable to picking up all the land, buildings, and people in New York City...

00:43.404 --> 00:44.759
...and dropping them into the sea.

00:45.299 --> 00:47.308
A tsunami is not a single wave,...

00:47.707 --> 00:50.556
...but instead a series of extremely long waves,...

00:50.807 --> 00:53.658
...spanning upwards of 200 kilometers in distance.

00:54.905 --> 00:57.894
Tsunamis can move up to 800 kilometers per hour,...

00:58.488 --> 01:00.155
...as fast as a passenger jet.

01:00.779 --> 01:04.961
Even after traveling thousands of kilometers, when it reaches shallow water,...

01:05.405 --> 01:09.144
...a tsunami can grow to 25 or 30 meters in height.

01:09.656 --> 01:11.549
A tsunami can also be deceptive.

01:12.051 --> 01:14.748
If the trough of the initial wave is first to arrive,...

01:15.206 --> 01:18.803
...water might retreat from shore like an unusual low tide.

01:19.405 --> 01:24.805
People who explore the newly - exposed sea floor are then vulnerable as the massive crest arrives.

01:25.205 --> 01:28.799
And if the shore is flat enough, the wave keeps going inland,...

01:29.203 --> 01:32.262
...devastating cities and villages in mere moments.

01:32.702 --> 01:37.504
A worldwide tsunami detection system could not prevent every death from these waves.

01:38.248 --> 01:42.603
But after such an event, and with a proper warning system,...

01:43.155 --> 01:48.748
...people across the seas might have several hours to react and escape with their lives.
