Hey party people, I'm Bridget Daly at the ClevverMusic Studios.

00:08.033 --> 00:14.157
Today, YouTube phenomenon Rebecca Black finally broke her silence over her Friday music video,...

00:14.443 --> 00:17.269
...which is now up to almost 17 million hits.

00:17.693 --> 00:20.309
She spoke with Good Morning America's Andrea Canning,...

00:20.623 --> 00:24.795
...who, btdubs is the same woman who got the exclusive interview with Charlie Sheen.

00:25.205 --> 00:29.309
...Rebecca talked about how much her life has changed since last Friday,...

00:29.756 --> 00:32.574
...saying, "I can't even tell if I'm awake or not, it's crazy."

00:33.261 --> 00:35.629
Black went on to say that the nasty comments she's been getting...

00:35.698 --> 00:37.950
...on her YouTube and Twitter have been hurtful,...

00:38.372 --> 00:39.981
...and she said she didn't think she deserved it.

00:40.357 --> 00:43.413
Rebecca added, "I think I have some talent on some level,...

00:43.743 --> 00:47.444
...I don't think I'm the worst singer, but I don't think I'm the best singer."

00:48.205 --> 00:51.841
Seems fair enough. But this may be where we draw the line.

00:52.137 --> 00:56.153
RB now wants to collaborate with none other than Justin Bieber.

00:56.575 --> 01:00.145
She told Andrea, "I have Bieber fever, I am in love with Justin Bieber."

01:00.470 --> 01:04.451
She then looked directly into the camera and spoke to the Biebs, saying, "Justin,...

01:04.780 --> 01:07.645
...if you're watching this right now, would you do a duet with me?"

01:07.939 --> 01:10.724
"That would be unreal, that would just like, make my life."

01:11.468 --> 01:15.780
Now, Justin hasn't responded yet, shocker I know.

01:16.125 --> 01:17.827
So, do you think this is a good idea?

01:18.093 --> 01:19.385
We want to know what you guys think!
