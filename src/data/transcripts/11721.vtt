At the Mid - America Earthquake Center, you can see what would happen...

00:03.870 --> 00:09.770
...to your cabinets, computers, televisions, and family should the ground underneath start to shake.

00:10.980 --> 00:12.970
The Institute for Business and Home Safety says....

00:13.070 --> 00:17.580
...there are several easy and inexpensive steps you can take inside your house to make it safer.

00:18.080 --> 00:21.650
These include anchoring bookcases and filing cabinets to the wall,...

00:22.020 --> 00:25.790
...installing ledge barriers on shelves, putting heavier things lower,...

00:25.890 --> 00:31.360
...and attaching breakables directly to the shelves with museum wax or Velcro to keep them from falling;...

00:31.760 --> 00:35.230
...attaching computers to desks, small appliances to counter tops,...

00:35.360 --> 00:40.200
...and anchoring large appliances like refrigerators or water heaters to the walls.

00:40.940 --> 00:43.500
Many of these simple changes cost just a few dollars,...

00:43.670 --> 00:46.010
...a little more if you're going to hire outside help.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.110
The more you do, the stronger your home will become.
