Top five tips from a Gordon Ramsay perspective on money and business.

00:10.465 --> 00:12.005
First and foremost, of course, would be passion.

00:13.173 --> 00:16.139
You are a standard-bearer.

00:16.546 --> 00:21.795
You have to become a leader and whatever you do influences the staff.

00:23.935 --> 00:29.056
And the second big point would be establishing their commitment.

00:29.821 --> 00:33.361
Businesses don't become successful unless you're 110% committed.

00:33.924 --> 00:37.087
So at work, we spend more time together than we do with our families.

00:37.488 --> 00:40.179
So if you're gonna do it, do it properly or don't do it at all.

00:41.991 --> 00:44.960
Thirdly is taking on competition.

00:45.555 --> 00:48.994
Everyone thinks that it's rife and that it's difficult, but competition is healthy.

00:49.455 --> 00:52.290
Every time a new restaurant opens up, I make sure that if it's not me,...

00:52.676 --> 00:54.821
...one of my members or staff, from the kitchen and the dining room,...

00:55.149 --> 00:56.810
...are there over the competition.

00:57.090 --> 01:00.718
There's so much to learn from a bad meal and so much to gain from a good meal.

01:01.101 --> 01:05.059
So staying in front of your competition is healthy.

01:07.114 --> 01:13.781
Fourthly, the creative input and coming out with that level of initiative,...

01:15.031 --> 01:18.567
...and relieving the boredom when customers constantly see the same food.

01:18.956 --> 01:23.936
So you have to be six months in front of your customer and make sure that they come back...

01:24.311 --> 01:28.058
...with the same excitement and they leave as if it's their first visit.

01:30.329 --> 01:36.206
Finally, the key to a successful business is remembering the customer's king...

01:36.860 --> 01:39.041
...because without them, we're nobody.

01:39.567 --> 01:44.369
And so, I, from a chef's point of view, always put myself in a customer's situation where...

01:44.780 --> 01:45.982
...I see it from their eyes.

01:46.111 --> 01:47.051
I don't cook for chefs.

01:47.731 --> 01:49.055
Every time chefs come into the dining room,...

01:49.176 --> 01:50.744
...first thing that they do is turn out the plates upside down and...

01:51.023 --> 01:56.074
...start photographing the food and they're constantly, you know, dissecting the food...

01:56.837 --> 01:57.931
...as opposed to enjoying it.

01:58.290 --> 02:01.261
So I always look at it from the customer's perspective...

02:01.713 --> 02:04.975
...because they're king and without them we're history.
