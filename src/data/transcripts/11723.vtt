00:11.962 --> 00:13.401
From the moment we are born,...

00:14.293 --> 00:15.310
...we live visually.

00:17.548 --> 00:19.196
We think visually.

00:20.607 --> 00:22.820
We imagine visually.

00:24.596 --> 00:25.556
We speak visually.

00:28.142 --> 00:30.919
Before words, we painted in caves.

00:31.440 --> 00:35.503
And when there were words, we used them to conjure up images.

00:36.804 --> 00:39.492
We paint pictures to tell stories,...

00:40.195 --> 00:42.115
...take photos to share moments...

00:44.358 --> 00:47.795
...and watch movies to take us to places beyond our imagination.

00:50.255 --> 00:52.215
We make films to share what we love...

00:53.260 --> 00:55.714
...and create images to get people talking.

00:57.177 --> 00:58.744
We are visual beings.

01:02.598 --> 01:06.504
It is through these visual experiences that we define who we are,...

01:07.711 --> 01:11.549
...what we believe and what we truly care about.

01:13.904 --> 01:15.956
We all live a visual life.

01:17.493 --> 01:18.954
How do you live yours?
