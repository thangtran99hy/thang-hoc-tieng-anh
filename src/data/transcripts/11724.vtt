00:00.854 --> 00:04.895
In a nuclear reactor, there are three primary barriers to radiation release.

00:05.345 --> 00:06.706
The first is the fuel assembly.

00:07.486 --> 00:13.107
The Zircaloy rods around the fuel protect from the release of radioactive material.

00:13.374 --> 00:16.001
The second is the pressure vessel which surrounds the core...

00:16.501 --> 00:19.548
...that also prevents the release of radioactive material.

00:19.952 --> 00:24.047
The third is the containment structure surrounding the entire reactor.

00:24.547 --> 00:30.212
The containment structure prevents the uncontrolled release of radioactive material from the reactor.

00:30.756 --> 00:35.877
Now, the entire structure is designed to withstand a multitude of natural disasters...

00:36.177 --> 00:42.747
...including tornado, earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami, hurricanes as well,...

00:42.856 --> 00:45.659
...and the storm surge associated with those facilities.

00:46.862 --> 00:51.496
And the facility, to give you an idea of some of the design things that we incorporate,...

00:51.842 --> 00:57.395
...the picture shown here has a picture of a building that contains a diesel generator.

00:57.751 --> 01:02.216
The intake structure for the diesel generator where the air comes in to supply the diesel...

01:02.664 --> 01:06.516
...is raised above ground at about 25 to 30 feet off...

01:06.607 --> 01:10.544
...to protect it from any storm surge that might occur from a hurricane for example.

01:11.101 --> 01:17.506
The surrounding equipment at ground level is not essential to maintaining the ability to safely shut down the facility.
