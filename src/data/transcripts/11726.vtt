I'm Judd Brown, Exhibits Manager at the American Museum of Science and Energy.

00:08.106 --> 00:10.344
And we're going to show you how a nuclear power plant works.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.780
This is a nuclear reactor and here's where everything starts.

00:20.398 --> 00:23.041
The nuclear reactor splits atoms to produce heat.

00:23.968 --> 00:27.107
The reactor core sends hot water over into the steam boilers.

00:27.579 --> 00:30.450
We now refer to steam boilers as steam generators.

00:31.269 --> 00:33.821
We bring in cooler water down in this section...

00:33.914 --> 00:37.741
...and as the cool water comes into the steam boilers, it's turned into steam.

00:38.799 --> 00:42.946
Steam is routed across this top section which turns the blades of a turbine.

00:45.067 --> 00:48.399
The turbine turns a generator which produces electricity.

00:49.665 --> 00:53.507
That electricity can then be used to supply up to 800,000 people.

00:55.669 --> 00:57.066
Once the electricity is produced,...

00:57.158 --> 01:00.740
...we can use these two systems to cool down our waters so that it can be reused.

01:01.762 --> 01:04.517
Currently in Tennessee, we have two nuclear power plants...

01:04.957 --> 01:07.593
...with a total operating capacity of three units.

01:08.634 --> 01:12.719
Nuclear power plants have a useful life expectancy of some 40 to 50 years,...

01:13.246 --> 01:17.062
...making 'em viable for producing electricity for several generations.

01:18.255 --> 01:20.955
I'm Judd Brown at the American Museum of Science and Energy.

01:21.019 --> 01:24.079
