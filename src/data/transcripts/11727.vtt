00:00.500 --> 00:02.750
North America and all the other continents...

00:03.130 --> 00:06.030
...seem to stay in the same locations year after year.

00:06.570 --> 00:11.110
Actually however, the continents are moving slowly relative to one another.

00:12.010 --> 00:17.450
In the past 200 million years, the continents have moved from the location shown.

00:18.510 --> 00:21.820
The Theory of Plate Tectonics accounts for this movement.

00:22.450 --> 00:27.820
According to this theory, the continents and ocean floors are parts of about 30 plates,...

00:28.120 --> 00:29.660
...the largest of which are shown.

00:31.730 --> 00:35.830
Each plate consists partly of crust, the outermost layer of the Earth,...

00:36.460 --> 00:40.000
...and partly of mantle, a thick layer of hot rock.

00:41.300 --> 00:43.540
The plates slide on the asthenosphere,...

00:44.010 --> 00:48.780
...a layer of mantle that is so hot, it flows, even though it remains solid.

00:50.010 --> 00:51.880
200 million years ago,...

00:52.250 --> 00:56.380
...all the continents were parts of a single landmass called Pangaea.

00:58.090 --> 01:03.090
Pangaea broke apart into masses called Laurasia and Gondwanaland.

01:04.430 --> 01:07.930
In turn, Laurasia and Gondwanaland broke apart.

01:09.360 --> 01:13.400
One piece of Gondwanaland, India, later joined Asia.

01:14.800 --> 01:19.970
In the next 50 million years, the continents may move to these locations.
