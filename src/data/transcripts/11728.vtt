00:05.430 --> 00:08.570
Making a good first impression is the key to landing any job.

00:08.870 --> 00:10.310
And that starts with your resume.

00:10.770 --> 00:13.680
Learn how to properly send it out and land that job.

00:14.580 --> 00:19.080
You'll need: a resume and a cover letter, recipient's contact information,...

00:19.580 --> 00:22.780
...several formats of your resume and a follow-up inquiry.

00:23.720 --> 00:26.650
Step 1: Send a cover letter with the resume.

00:26.990 --> 00:31.660
Be sure to tailor both the resume and cover letter to each specific job you're applying for.

00:32.350 --> 00:37.600
Step 2: Find the name of a specific person at the company who you can address your resume to.

00:38.130 --> 00:42.900
This will ensure that it ends up on their desk or in their inbox rather than floating around the office.

00:43.540 --> 00:46.510
Step 3: If it's not clear from the job ad,...

00:46.740 --> 00:49.810
...inquire with the company about which method of sending they prefer:...

00:50.210 --> 00:52.110
...e-mail, fax or mail.

00:52.850 --> 00:56.250
Step 4: Send the resume as a PDF attachment.

00:56.680 --> 01:00.620
There are many different word processors and not all are compatible with each format.

01:01.060 --> 01:03.790
The job posting might note which format is preferred.

01:04.260 --> 01:07.400
Try copying and pasting your resume into the body of the e-mail...

01:07.600 --> 01:09.600
...if you don't know which format to go with.

01:10.500 --> 01:14.270
Step 5: Follow up on the resume with a phone call or e-mail...

01:14.440 --> 01:16.640
...after about a week if you haven't heard anything.

01:17.610 --> 01:18.140
Good luck.

01:19.210 --> 01:24.280
Did you know, the United States Postal Service's first postmaster general was Benjamin Franklin,...

01:24.510 --> 01:26.420
...who was appointed in 1775?
