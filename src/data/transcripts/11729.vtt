Hey, everybody. This is Eric with Phone Scoop.

00:03.037 --> 00:08.321
We're just taking a quick look at the Samsung Galaxy tab 10.1,...

00:08.842 --> 00:12.550
...a new Android tablet from Samsung.

00:12.960 --> 00:15.070
It has a 10.1-inch screen...

00:15.501 --> 00:18.801
...and has a little bit of a different design compared to the original.

00:19.753 --> 00:23.891
On one side, we have the power key, a headset jack, and speakers.

00:24.877 --> 00:26.020
Nothing along the bottom. 

00:26.576 --> 00:29.166
On the right, we've got more speakers and a SIM card slot,...

00:29.754 --> 00:32.356
...and then on the right, we just have the volume toggle.

00:33.149 --> 00:35.945
On the back we can see, I like this design.

00:36.001 --> 00:37.936
It's kind of like a carbon fiber feel to it. 

00:38.497 --> 00:44.106
And the tab has a whopping 8-megapixel camera with a flash.

00:44.201 --> 00:46.614
So, that is the Galaxy tab...

00:46.851 --> 00:50.825
...and that is running Android 3.0 as we can see here.

00:51.307 --> 00:54.161
We've got all sorts of different home screens.

00:54.610 --> 00:58.072
And if we go to the apps, you can see the different applications.

00:58.787 --> 01:00.771
It doesn't look like they have too many loaded on this device, though.

01:01.325 --> 01:04.601
So, that is a quick look at the Samsung Galaxy tab 10.1.
