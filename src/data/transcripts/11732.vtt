00:00.349 --> 00:05.504
The other 800-pound gorilla in the room produces a fifth of the electricity in the US.

00:06.113 --> 00:07.451
Despite its issues,...

00:07.557 --> 00:12.169
...the climate change conundrum has brought out a huge advantage over fossil fuels.

00:12.507 --> 00:14.256
Nuclear is CO2-free...

00:14.625 --> 00:18.857
...as well as having a possible advantage over some renewable energy sources.

00:19.095 --> 00:22.863
To reproduce the power that one single nuclear power plant makes,...

00:23.342 --> 00:26.215
...we're talking about building 10,000 windmills.

00:26.693 --> 00:30.302
Where are you gonna put 10,000 windmills to replace one nuclear power station?

00:30.632 --> 00:32.207
It's very, very difficult.

00:32.938 --> 00:38.244
And a technical challenge from the standpoint of not only public acceptance but also land use.

00:38.354 --> 00:40.405
Nuclear plants simply don't emit any CO2.

00:40.785 --> 00:47.105
We, I think, in the nuclear field save over a billion tons of CO2 per year.

00:47.442 --> 00:50.771
So we're saving with nuclear considerable amount of CO2.

00:51.297 --> 00:55.166
The more the public knows about what nuclear really is, the more they like it.

00:55.750 --> 00:59.518
And I think the challenge for the industry is getting that story told.

00:59.652 --> 01:05.471
Nuclear power in many ways is hugely safe compared to the fossil fuels.

01:05.557 --> 01:07.226
It doesn't emit greenhouse gases.

01:07.971 --> 01:16.710
The amount of residue that has to be stored afterwards is not in the billions and billions of tons...

01:16.819 --> 01:19.207
...but a tiny, tiny fraction of that.

01:20.623 --> 01:25.809
In the United States we have a program called the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP),...

01:26.514 --> 01:30.504
...which we're now in the process to do a preconceptual design of such a reactor.
