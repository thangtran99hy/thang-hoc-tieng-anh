Earthquakes are caused by the movement of the huge tectonic plates that continents sit on.

00:06.591 --> 00:08.396
What happens is, they come together...

00:08.631 --> 00:14.712
...and one, in this case the Pacific plate, is moving below the Japanese or Eurasian plate...

00:15.084 --> 00:19.306
...that causes that plate to bend when it sticks there. There'll be a bit too much friction.

00:19.654 --> 00:23.845
It'll stick, pressure builds up, until suddenly it's released in a flick.

00:24.796 --> 00:25.564
Have a look at this.

00:26.099 --> 00:29.093
Now, this is the tectonic plate that Japan is sat on.

00:29.357 --> 00:32.741
And here's the Pacific plate coming down underneath it.

00:33.561 --> 00:37.161
And normally, they want to move together at about nine centimeters a year.

00:37.995 --> 00:39.804
But sometimes, they get stuck.

00:40.341 --> 00:41.369
And when they get stuck,...

00:41.830 --> 00:45.409
...the energy of them moving together gets translated to strain energy.

00:45.522 --> 00:49.238
They literally flex and bend in these huge slabs of rock.

00:49.895 --> 00:51.849
The energy builds and builds.

00:52.152 --> 00:54.358
They're flexing and bending more and more.

00:54.895 --> 01:01.343
When they finally slip, that stored energy, all that twist and bend in the rock gets released into sudden movement...

01:02.538 --> 01:04.662
...like that.

01:06.099 --> 01:10.464
As you can see, it literally flicks up, moving the ocean floor above it...

01:10.668 --> 01:13.109
...which moves the ocean, causing a tsunami.

01:19.902 --> 01:23.652
So here, we've got a bigger, submarine version of what's going on.

01:23.961 --> 01:30.772
Now, this gives a representation of what's been happening 24 kilometers below the ocean surface in a Japan trench.

01:31.369 --> 01:34.219
And these things work in what they call a stick - slip way.

01:34.623 --> 01:37.750
Most of the time, they're stuck, but occasionally they slip.

01:38.114 --> 01:39.381
And that's what an earthquake is.

01:40.038 --> 01:42.410
So, we've got it here, this is bent up here.

01:42.755 --> 01:45.913
It's full of pent-up energy waiting to slip.

01:46.209 --> 01:47.464
And when the slip happens,...

01:49.547 --> 01:55.009
...that energy gets released into the ocean, causing a series of tsunami waves...

01:56.248 --> 01:58.748
...moving in both directions across the Pacific.
