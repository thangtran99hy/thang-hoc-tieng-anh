So what's the fear with us in this country, are people really concerned?

00:04.155 --> 00:08.148
Radioactive iodine is released into the air and then it's carried by the wind.

00:08.602 --> 00:12.854
And as it's carried by the wind, it's obviously dispersed over time...

00:12.952 --> 00:16.553
...so the dosage decreases and the distance increases.

00:16.800 --> 00:20.628
You think about L.A., it's 5,000 to 6,000 miles away from Fukushima.

00:20.861 --> 00:23.959
So by the time it got to there or Washington State,...

00:24.101 --> 00:27.009
...it's actually diluted down and a lot of it is decayed.

00:27.304 --> 00:33.360
So the actual exposure to Americans from that worst - case scenario is gonna be very minimal.

00:33.630 --> 00:37.601
But do have a plan to be prepared for any emergency.

00:37.727 --> 00:39.060
Know where to meet your loved ones.

00:39.129 --> 00:41.601
You might not have cellphone or Internet access.

00:41.997 --> 00:43.428
You might have to walk to that site.

00:43.656 --> 00:48.357
And at home, have food, water, batteries for your flashlight,...

00:48.652 --> 00:50.012
...but have an emergency plan.

00:50.458 --> 00:52.654
