00:00.460 --> 00:02.600
Making up for missing your anniversary.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.800
Oh, she looks very pleased with you, Gary.

00:09.070 --> 00:12.240
You know why? 'Cause you forgot your anniversary again.

00:12.770 --> 00:16.140
But this time you won't have to sleep in the garage for a week. Why?

00:16.550 --> 00:19.480
Because you have me and I have many nuggets of wisdom.

00:19.780 --> 00:22.780
First tip Gary, don't try and lie your way out of it.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.390
Bet you thought I forgot it was our anniversary.

00:26.760 --> 00:30.950
I didn't, I didn't. I got you a present. I got you... I know you love brooches...

00:31.150 --> 00:34.730
...and I got you a butterfly brooch from Zanzibar.

00:35.360 --> 00:37.800
And it will be here, but because of the recession...

00:37.900 --> 00:39.770
Don't tell me. Pirates again?

00:40.440 --> 00:45.340
Damn you, pirates. Why must you ruin every anniversary of mine, you pirates?

00:46.140 --> 00:48.380
That was pathetic, Gary. You're better than that.

00:48.780 --> 00:51.750
Come on man, your wife is way smarter than you. It's evident.

00:52.080 --> 00:56.280
Throw yourself on the mercy of the court. She'll ... well, I don't know what she'll do.

00:56.680 --> 01:02.520
I love you so much and I can't believe I did this but I forgot it's our anniversary.

01:02.860 --> 01:07.060
Much better Gary, a little contrition. Worst part is over. No, it's not.

01:07.660 --> 01:09.660
Sacrifices are gonna have to be made.

01:09.930 --> 01:14.170
The old standbys of chocolate, flowers, and IOU back massages,...

01:14.540 --> 01:17.340
...they're not gonna cut the mustard this time. You gotta be creative, Gary.

01:17.610 --> 01:21.410
Might have to try arts and crafts. Got one word for you, collage.

01:21.880 --> 01:24.450
Friendly word, say it, "collage."

01:25.050 --> 01:26.980
Gonna wish you paid attention in home economics.

01:28.780 --> 01:29.750
Hey, look at him go.

01:33.020 --> 01:35.460
But you're not done, buddy. Gifts are not enough.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.990
You need the R word. Romance.

01:48.070 --> 01:50.710
Well played, Gary. I told you Javier was the man.

01:51.010 --> 01:53.140
He played at my wedding and my honeymoon.

01:53.680 --> 01:57.250
Until next time, enjoy being a man who can get the tough things done.

01:57.550 --> 01:59.780
The one of a kind crunchy nuggets in Grape - Nuts...

01:59.880 --> 02:02.780
...gave Gary the energy he needed to get the tough things done.

02:03.220 --> 02:06.990
Stay tuned to see how the other guys tackle the tough things in their lives.
