Hi, my name is Mark and we're gonna look at small business ideas for going green.

00:05.430 --> 00:09.670
What I mean by green is basically working in an environmentally friendly manner.

00:10.270 --> 00:15.280
Some of the issues we are being faced with daily, in terms of the environmental issues,...

00:15.860 --> 00:18.710
...are the excess amount of paper we use in an office.

00:19.180 --> 00:21.350
So, obviously, if we're using the Internet more and more,...

00:21.750 --> 00:24.020
...we should try and reduce our paper usage.

00:24.850 --> 00:27.190
At the same time, we're using more and more energy...

00:27.990 --> 00:29.730
...when we use our Internet through our computers.

00:30.390 --> 00:33.760
So maybe we should be more efficient with our use of the computer,...

00:33.960 --> 00:35.660
...switching it on and off,...

00:36.180 --> 00:37.600
...the beginning and the end of every day.

00:37.900 --> 00:40.240
Make sure that it's switched off so we're not using the power.

00:41.470 --> 00:44.970
Also, we think about the products that we're using in the office.

00:45.370 --> 00:49.180
For example, if your office has a kitchen, you might be using cleaning detergents.

00:49.680 --> 00:54.850
Well, maybe you could buy cleaning detergents that are packaged in eco-friendly...

00:55.300 --> 00:57.850
...or environmentally friendly cartons.

00:58.370 --> 01:02.290
That could be some form of office policy and imprint...

01:02.700 --> 01:06.190
...from the organization to show that it's going green in that respect.

01:06.440 --> 01:12.230
There are all kinds of things that you can do to reduce the amount of energy you use...

01:12.750 --> 01:17.410
...and consume, and the types of materials you use can be changed as well.

01:17.760 --> 01:19.340
Make sure it's office policy; go green!
