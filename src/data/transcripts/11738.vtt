As well as being one of Madrid's most popular meeting spots,...

00:12.067 --> 00:14.375
...the Puerta Del Sol or Gateway of the Sun...

00:14.756 --> 00:17.925
...is also a point from which the main road distances in Spain are measured...

00:18.271 --> 00:21.106
...and six of its national highways technically start here.

00:21.733 --> 00:24.206
So, "galleta" is Spanish for cookie or biscuit.

00:24.748 --> 00:29.154
But unless I figure out where to buy them, that information is useless.

00:32.665 --> 00:36.028
The ladies are actually an order of nuns known as the Carboneras,...

00:36.338 --> 00:39.917
...after the coal bunker in which the convent's portrait of the Virgin Mary was found.

00:41.327 --> 00:44.429
But they're probably better known for selling their homemade goodies,...

00:44.669 --> 00:47.455
...which the Carboneras have done since the 17th century.

00:47.724 --> 00:49.359
The nuns belong to a closed order,...

00:49.431 --> 00:51.835
...which means they've taken a strict vow of isolation.

00:52.088 --> 00:55.422
So, how do you sell cookies and stay out of sight?

01:00.389 --> 01:00.907
Piece of cake.

01:02.844 --> 01:07.702
Madrid's wrought iron Atocha train station to the south of the city is over 100 years old.

01:08.297 --> 01:10.958
But the garden didn't make an appearance until the 1980s.

01:12.061 --> 01:15.618
The much needed overhaul was part of a wave of growth and rejuvenation...

01:15.866 --> 01:19.700
...that followed nearly four decades of General Franco's right-wing dictatorship.

01:21.347 --> 01:24.752
Originally created exclusively for royalty and high society,...

01:25.173 --> 01:30.791
...Madrid's huge and beautiful Parque del Retiro later relaxed the rules to include anyone in proper attire.

01:33.628 --> 01:35.071
These days, anything goes...

01:35.433 --> 01:37.519
...so everyone can enjoy its lush greenery,...

01:37.721 --> 01:40.617
...open spaces or the cool waters of the artificial lake...

01:40.971 --> 01:43.896
...in front of Alfonso XII's impressive mausoleum.
