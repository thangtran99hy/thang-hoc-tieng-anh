00:05.207 --> 00:10.121
The way we eat has changed more in the last 50 years than in the previous 10,000.

00:10.233 --> 00:14.169
The modern supermarket has, on average, 47,000 products.

00:14.297 --> 00:17.332
The industry doesn't want you to know the truth about what you're eating...

00:17.481 --> 00:19.441
...because if you knew, you might not want to eat it.

00:19.536 --> 00:23.475
We've never had food companies this powerful in our history.

00:23.541 --> 00:28.038
Everything we've done in modern agriculture is to grow it faster, fatter, bigger, cheaper.

00:28.105 --> 00:30.328
If you can grow a chicken in 49 days,...

00:30.423 --> 00:32.555
...why would you want one you gotta grow in three months?

00:32.815 --> 00:35.385
When you go through the supermarket, there is an illusion of diversity.

00:35.469 --> 00:39.962
So much of our industrial food turns out to be rearrangements of corn.

00:44.779 --> 00:46.489
Sometimes you look at a vegetable and say,...

00:46.577 --> 00:49.819
"Okay well, we can get two hamburgers for the same price."

00:49.899 --> 00:53.659
They have managed to make it against the law to criticize their products.

00:53.730 --> 00:59.408
There is an effort to make it illegal to publish a photo of any industrial food operation.

01:01.417 --> 01:07.721
I find it incredible that the FDA wants to allow the sale of meat from cloned animals without any labeling.

01:07.975 --> 01:10.020
Peanut butter contaminated with salmonella,...

01:10.185 --> 01:12.873
...E. coli has been found in spinach, apple juice,...

01:13.505 --> 01:15.047
...smells like money to me!

01:17.076 --> 01:19.518
The average consumer does not feel very powerful.

01:19.645 --> 01:20.701
It's the exact opposite.

01:22.214 --> 01:24.382
When we run an item past the supermarket scanner,...

01:24.457 --> 01:27.475
...we're voting for local or not, organic or not.

01:27.624 --> 01:28.919
Look at the tobacco industry.

01:29.012 --> 01:34.853
The battle against tobacco is a perfect model of how an industry's irresponsible behavior can be changed.

01:39.626 --> 01:42.651
Imagine what it would be if, as a national policy,...

01:42.963 --> 01:48.031
...the idea would be to have such nutritionally dense food that people actually felt better,...

01:48.100 --> 01:50.183
...had more energy, and weren't sick as much.

01:50.885 --> 01:52.677
You know, now see, now that's a noble goal!

01:54.741 --> 01:58.746
People have got to start demanding good wholesome food of us and we'll deliver.

01:58.877 --> 01:59.519
I promise you.
