I want you now to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities,...

00:25.720 --> 00:32.330
...or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again.

00:33.900 --> 00:39.370
We at Berkley Bionics call these robots exoskeletons.

00:41.100 --> 00:45.370
These are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning,...

00:45.470 --> 00:52.210
...and it will give you extra strength and it will further enhance your speed,...

00:52.720 --> 00:56.350
...and it will help you, for instance, to manage your balance.

00:57.190 --> 01:02.760
It is actually the true integration of the man and the machine.

01:03.290 --> 01:10.400
But not only that, it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there.

01:10.830 --> 01:18.570
So let me now introduce to you HULC, or the Human Universal Load Carrier.

01:19.910 --> 01:25.080
With the HULC exoskeleton, I can carry 200 pounds over varied terrain for many hours.

01:25.380 --> 01:30.550
Its flexible design allows for deep squats, crawls and high - agility movements.

01:31.090 --> 01:35.920
It senses what I wanna do, where I wanna go, and then augments my strength and endurance.

01:37.630 --> 01:43.930
Let me now introduce you to eLEGS that is worn by Amanda Boxtel...

01:44.400 --> 01:47.440
...that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured,...

01:48.240 --> 01:54.780
...and, as a result of that, she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now.

02:03.350 --> 02:10.330
Amanda is wearing our eLEGS, like I said. It has sensors.

02:10.460 --> 02:17.200
It's completely non - invasive. Sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer...

02:17.600 --> 02:19.700
...that is sitting here at her back.

02:20.400 --> 02:25.470
There are battery packs here as well that power motors that are sitting at her hips,...

02:25.810 --> 02:33.380
...as well as her knee joints, that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural gait.

02:34.280 --> 02:37.490
As you can see, we have the technology,...

02:38.250 --> 02:42.420
...we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you.

02:43.630 --> 02:52.630
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations...

02:53.030 --> 03:01.580
...not only for the soldiers or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users, but for everyone.

03:04.080 --> 03:04.380
Thank you.
