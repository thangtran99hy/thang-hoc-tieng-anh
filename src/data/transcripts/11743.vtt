Tom liked Saturdays because there was no school.

00:06.270 --> 00:12.170
However, he did not like this Saturday. Aunt Polly said he had to paint the fence.

00:12.580 --> 00:17.980
He hated painting the fence. It was hard work. He wanted to play with his friends.

00:18.380 --> 00:22.480
Jim came along, carrying a bucket. He had to get some water.

00:22.950 --> 00:25.520
Tom would rather get water than paint the fence.

00:25.990 --> 00:31.130
Jim agreed to paint while Tom got the water, but Aunt Polly saw and stopped them.

00:31.730 --> 00:34.060
The next boy to come along was Ben.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.870
He was eating an apple and Tom was hungry.

00:37.570 --> 00:38.530
"Hello, Tom!"

00:39.130 --> 00:42.900
Tom did not answer. He pretended to be busy painting.

00:43.540 --> 00:47.880
"Hey, Tom! It's a nice day. I'm going to the river for a swim."

00:48.210 --> 00:49.880
"It's too bad you have to work!"

00:50.550 --> 00:55.250
"This is not work," said Tom. "It's fun. I like it!"

00:55.780 --> 00:56.280
"Really?"

00:56.750 --> 01:02.190
"Of course! You can go swimming every day, but you can't paint the fence every day."

01:02.790 --> 01:05.830
Ben thought about it. He was interested.

01:06.190 --> 01:07.630
"Let me try, Tom."

01:08.230 --> 01:09.360
Tom thought about it.

01:09.860 --> 01:12.900
"Aunt Polly won't let anyone else do it."

01:13.070 --> 01:16.300
"Come on, Tom! Let me try. I'll be careful."

01:16.870 --> 01:18.040
Tom shook his head.

01:18.340 --> 01:20.640
"I'll give you my apple if you let me try."

01:21.280 --> 01:26.610
At last, Tom agreed. He sat down and ate the apple while Ben painted the fence.

01:27.520 --> 01:31.290
Other boys came along. They all wanted to do some painting.

01:31.820 --> 01:35.390
The boys painted the fence three times and Tom was rich!
