00:02.689 --> 00:08.144
New Orleans' Mardi Gras is more than just a celebration before the Christian season of Lent begins.

00:09.293 --> 00:14.401
In this city, preparations for the big day begin weeks and even months in advance.

00:17.837 --> 00:19.918
Early mornings are nothing new for bakers.

00:20.360 --> 00:23.250
But the pre - dawn workload grows during Carnival season.

00:24.421 --> 00:26.899
From January 6 through Fat Tuesday,...

00:27.258 --> 00:30.945
...New Orleans' Cake Cafe and Bakery is a beehive of activity,...

00:31.539 --> 00:34.277
...where they make as many as 50 King Cakes a day.

00:35.239 --> 00:38.920
Here, they make non - traditional goat cheese and apple stuffed cakes.

00:39.516 --> 00:42.712
There's very old-school King Cakes in New Orleans;...

00:42.795 --> 00:45.320
...they've been at it for 50, 60, 100 years some of them.

00:45.876 --> 00:47.364
And they have a loyal following.

00:48.199 --> 00:52.219
The old-school King Cake has a tiny baby or other trinket baked inside.

00:52.762 --> 00:55.099
And whoever gets the trinket has obligations,...

00:55.405 --> 00:57.452
...such as buying next year's King Cake.

00:58.565 --> 01:00.919
Here, the baby goes on the outside.

01:02.028 --> 01:05.513
The King Cake is a traditional New Orleans Mardi Gras pastry.

01:06.081 --> 01:08.563
You'll find pastries like this all over the country and all over the world,...

01:08.660 --> 01:11.311
...that they're only served for a certain season during the year.

01:14.271 --> 01:20.197
In another part of town, Sally Hedrick and her son are making 150 or more ornate costumes.

01:21.185 --> 01:25.253
These are for the social organizations throwing the lavish balls and parades.

01:25.866 --> 01:28.415
Some may go for more than $3,000.

01:29.928 --> 01:33.450
It's rewarding to see the women in these costumes gleam,...

01:33.798 --> 01:35.517
...but it's more rewarding to see the men...

01:35.962 --> 01:39.478
...because a man didn't get to dress up in beautiful clothes.

01:39.564 --> 01:40.779
He's usually in a tuxedo.

01:41.813 --> 01:43.757
Hedrick works on costumes year-round,...

01:44.176 --> 01:48.374
...refurbishing ones that took a bit of a beating during last year's Mardi Gras celebrations...

01:48.801 --> 01:50.247
...and creating new works.
