00:00.221 --> 00:02.473
Let me just remind you where we have been through,...

00:02.618 --> 00:03.315
...what we've been through.

00:03.967 --> 00:07.943
My dad, like many of your folks who got relatives here,...

00:09.903 --> 00:12.306
...many of you whose relatives did the same thing.

00:12.576 --> 00:15.562
Who are, you're here, your relatives probably are not.

00:21.833 --> 00:25.262
I think it is, in a sense, it's a...

00:26.183 --> 00:27.552
Let there be a stable Iran.

00:28.439 --> 00:32.065
Iran that is capable of rejecting Iranian influence.

00:32.706 --> 00:33.281
I mean Iraq.

00:33.940 --> 00:38.965
Our people done a really good job of hauling in a lot of the key operators.

00:39.750 --> 00:46.623
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi al-Shibh, whatever the guy's name was.

00:48.058 --> 00:50.362
Thanks for coming, be seated.

00:52.875 --> 00:55.758
Thanks for coming, welcome to the White House.

01:00.169 --> 01:00.903
Thanks for coming.

01:01.100 --> 01:02.114
If it feels good, do it.

01:03.305 --> 01:05.318
If you got a problem, blame somebody else.

01:07.024 --> 01:09.253
You may recall we went through a park in Botswana.

01:09.462 --> 01:12.901
Panama City, Panama.

01:13.033 --> 01:15.569
What you probably wanna know is the three words I'm not gonna tell you.

01:17.767 --> 01:19.448
I'm not going to tell you.

01:19.534 --> 01:20.360
That's five words.

01:24.441 --> 01:26.765
You'll be able to see a technology,...

01:29.576 --> 01:36.729
...a technology that will enable you to converse with somebody on long distance...

01:36.819 --> 01:38.849
...and it seems like the person is right there in the room with you.

01:40.061 --> 01:44.866
Yeah, I think tide turning, I see as I remembered, I was raised in the desert...

01:44.976 --> 01:47.650
...but tide's kinda, it's easy to see a tide turn.

01:49.409 --> 01:50.385
Did I say those words?

01:56.598 --> 01:58.615
The left hand now knows what the right hand is doing.

02:24.371 --> 02:25.775
