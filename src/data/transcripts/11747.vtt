Make this year's Easter eggs a work of art by learning how to marble them.

00:09.400 --> 00:14.980
It's simple. You will need: hard-boiled eggs, food dye, vegetable oil,...

00:15.240 --> 00:18.810
...containers, a spoon or dipper, and paper towels.

00:19.180 --> 00:22.280
Step 1: Prepare the egg dye according to the package,...

00:22.420 --> 00:24.690
...or make your own using natural food colorings.

00:25.120 --> 00:28.720
If you plan to eat the eggs, make sure you use food grade dyes.

00:29.060 --> 00:33.130
Step 2: Add a teaspoon of vegetable oil to each container of dye.

00:33.930 --> 00:38.600
If you want to dye some eggs normally or give them a base color before marbling, do that first.

00:38.830 --> 00:41.100
Once the oil is in the dye, you can't go back.

00:41.540 --> 00:44.840
Step 3: Using a spoon or the dipper that comes with a kit,...

00:45.010 --> 00:47.910
...lower the egg completely into the dye and remove it quickly.

00:48.210 --> 00:52.980
Because oil and water don't mix, you'll get color on some parts of the egg and none on others,...

00:53.110 --> 00:54.450
...creating a marbled effect.

00:54.780 --> 00:56.480
Keep dipping to get a brighter color.

00:56.920 --> 01:02.060
Step 4: Lightly pat the just dipped eggs with a paper towel or the color may become muddy.

01:02.260 --> 01:06.130
If you want to dip them in another color, wait until they're completely dry first.

01:06.960 --> 01:09.660
Experiment by adding a bit more oil to the dyes.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.030
Different amounts create different amounts of marbling.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.700
Step 5: Moisten a paper towel with vegetable oil...

01:15.870 --> 01:19.070
...and lightly wipe down the finished eggs with it to add a nice shine.

01:19.440 --> 01:25.010
Step 6: Refrigerate your eggs until you're ready to display them and wow everyone with your masterpiece.

01:25.910 --> 01:29.620
Did you know? In 2005, Belgian chocolate maker, Guylian,...

01:29.780 --> 01:35.950
...created a 27-foot, 3-inch tall, 4299-lb edible chocolate Easter egg...

01:36.120 --> 01:38.530
...out of 50,000 praline chocolate bars.
