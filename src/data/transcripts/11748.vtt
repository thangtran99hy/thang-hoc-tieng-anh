00:07.100 --> 00:09.800
There are things in this world worth fighting and dying for.

00:12.240 --> 00:16.040
We're warriors, it's who we are.

00:18.010 --> 00:19.380
We're the three musketeers.

00:19.810 --> 00:20.420
I've heard of you.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.320
We are surrounded by enemies.

00:28.190 --> 00:30.530
War will engulf the entire continent.

00:31.330 --> 00:33.800
Only we can prevent the coming apocalypse.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.300
D'Artagnan, you wanna be a musketeer?

00:38.900 --> 00:40.000
This is your chance.

01:06.090 --> 01:07.660
There were four of us against 40 of them.

01:08.600 --> 01:11.000
Was it 40 or 400?

01:11.150 --> 01:11.700
Just 40.

01:13.400 --> 01:13.900
It was an off day.
