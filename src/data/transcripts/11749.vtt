A man in Portland calls the police about a break-in from the house that he broke into.

00:06.104 --> 00:07.887
That is a story tailor-made for John Berman.

00:10.167 --> 00:13.753
The bad guys from Home Alone weren't particularly good at their jobs.

00:17.368 --> 00:18.846
But the worst criminal ever?

00:19.211 --> 00:22.770
Maybe, the guy who broke into this house in Portland, Oregon on Monday.

00:23.001 --> 00:23.559
911?

00:23.983 --> 00:25.422
I just broke into a house...

00:26.233 --> 00:28.321
...and the owners came home.

00:29.534 --> 00:30.678
You broke into a house?

00:31.182 --> 00:31.452
Yeah.

00:32.236 --> 00:34.714
See? The operator didn't believe it either.

00:35.161 --> 00:39.104
25 - year - old Timothy Chapek allegedly broke in to take a shower.

00:39.502 --> 00:42.517
When he heard the owner come home, he got scared...

00:42.797 --> 00:44.951
...and yes, called 911.

00:46.025 --> 00:46.757
They can hear me.

00:47.263 --> 00:51.759
In the middle of this 911 call, you can hear owner, Hillary McKenzie, confronts him.

00:51.944 --> 00:54.065
Why are you in my house taking a shower?
