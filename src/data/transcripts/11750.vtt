This recently discovered colony of penguins is unlike any other.

00:20.694 --> 00:24.645
They don't need to huddle together every winter for protection against the bitter cold...

00:25.432 --> 00:29.827
...because these little fellas can do something no other penguins can.

00:38.343 --> 00:39.377
Isn't that amazing?

00:55.486 --> 00:58.147
And how do they use this incredible ability?

00:59.008 --> 01:03.427
Well, they fly thousands of miles to rainforests of South America...

01:03.683 --> 01:07.769
...where they spend the winter basking in the tropical sun.
