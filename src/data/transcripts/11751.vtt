00:00.030 --> 00:02.437
Kia ora, and welcome aboard this Air New Zealand flight.

00:02.985 --> 00:07.136
Before we take off, we'd like to run you through a few in-flight safety exercises.

00:09.563 --> 00:10.491
Hi, everybody.

00:11.131 --> 00:15.944
In the next three minutes we're gonna work hard, work out, and get you fit to fly.

00:16.207 --> 00:17.562
Let's go!

00:18.244 --> 00:21.187
First, let's stretch it out and lose that baggage.

00:21.425 --> 00:25.726
Stretch it up to the overhead locker or slide it under the seat in front of you.

00:25.900 --> 00:28.852
Stretch and slide. Yeah!

00:29.300 --> 00:30.490
You're a giraffe!

00:30.961 --> 00:32.399
Now it's seat belt time.

00:32.665 --> 00:35.293
When the seat belt sign comes on, buckle it in.

00:35.514 --> 00:37.103
Grab, click, pull.

00:37.471 --> 00:38.747
Grab, click, pull.

00:39.004 --> 00:42.237
Nice and snug, low across the hips, but not too tight.

00:42.385 --> 00:44.670
And to undo your belt, just lift the flap.

00:45.063 --> 00:45.791
No sweat!

00:46.000 --> 00:49.003
Remember, you must follow crew instructions and lighted sign.

00:49.157 --> 00:52.576
If your oxygen mask drops down, it's time to take a breather.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.605
Pull it down over your nose and mouth,...

00:54.912 --> 00:57.963
...pull the elastic tight, and then breathe normally.

00:58.123 --> 01:01.319
And remember, put your mask on first before you help others.

01:01.763 --> 01:03.915
Don't worry if the bag's feeling a little flat.

01:04.164 --> 01:07.227
The oxygen will flow automatically.

01:07.352 --> 01:09.905
Okay now, for the recommended brace position.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.575
If there's an emergency during takeoff or landing,...

01:12.896 --> 01:15.906
...if you could reach, just lean and brace on the seat in front of you.

01:16.112 --> 01:18.711
Or, this is one of my favorites, it's called the duck.

01:18.899 --> 01:23.635
Flat beak, elbows outside your thighs, hands on your head, and duck on down.

01:26.501 --> 01:28.344
Now let's see where your life jacket's at.

01:28.628 --> 01:30.195
Down here, under your seat.

01:30.562 --> 01:32.153
Okay everybody, do what I do.

01:32.422 --> 01:33.223
Out of the pouch,...

01:33.992 --> 01:34.677
...over the head,...

01:35.027 --> 01:38.495
...clip together around, pull it tight, and get those arms moving.

01:38.705 --> 01:40.437
This red tag inflates your jacket.

01:40.561 --> 01:43.853
Only pull it when you step, step, step outside!

01:44.281 --> 01:49.461
If your life jacket's short on air, grab the mouthpiece here and blow and blow.

01:49.834 --> 01:51.334
Yeah! You're pumping it up!

01:52.102 --> 01:55.420
And if you've got an infant on board, the crew has a jacket for your baby.

01:55.733 --> 01:58.205
And sorry, this flight is strictly non - smoking.

01:58.376 --> 01:59.560
It's a safety hazard.

01:59.777 --> 02:03.091
So the captain says, "Let's kick butts!"

02:06.852 --> 02:11.977
If the lights go out in an emergency and the lights come on down here, it's time to move.

02:12.189 --> 02:14.301
Look around and see if anyone needs your help.

02:14.681 --> 02:16.902
These lights lead you to the exit.

02:17.260 --> 02:19.039
Come on everyone, let's pony!

02:21.675 --> 02:23.511
Your crew are now pointing out the exits.

02:23.733 --> 02:25.053
The nearest could be behind you.

02:25.293 --> 02:29.583
So count the rows and see two, three, four.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.863
I'm on a plane full of crazies.

02:33.672 --> 02:35.691
Stop broadcasting, buddy.

02:36.543 --> 02:38.740
Don't think it's the first time someone's ever said that to me.

02:42.625 --> 02:47.663
Electronic devices, even the cool ones, can interfere with our systems during takeoff and landing...

02:47.970 --> 02:48.843
...so switch it off.

02:49.175 --> 02:51.989
Now if you switch it to flight mode first, then turn it off,...

02:52.198 --> 02:53.625
...you can use it later in the flight.

02:54.589 --> 02:55.607
We're nearly done.

02:55.852 --> 02:58.153
During takeoff and landing, here's what we do.

02:58.544 --> 03:03.175
Tray tables back, seat upright, seat belt on, fantastic!

03:03.407 --> 03:06.716
If you need more information, it's on your safety information card.

03:07.034 --> 03:10.499
Now you're fit to fly.

03:10.716 --> 03:14.439
We hope you've enjoyed the safety exercise briefing from Air New Zealand.

03:14.835 --> 03:16.153
Thank you for flying with us today.

03:16.390 --> 03:18.847
Sit back, relax, and enjoy your flight.
