Japanese coast guards circling this wreckage of a house swept away by the March 11 tsunami...

00:05.700 --> 00:08.470
...got quite a surprise when they came in for a closer look.

00:09.200 --> 00:12.440
Scrambling out from beneath the rubble, a dog emerges.

00:13.210 --> 00:15.480
Seeming to have defied incredible odds,...

00:15.780 --> 00:18.780
...the dog is believed to have survived not only the tsunami,...

00:18.980 --> 00:20.750
...but three weeks at sea as well.

00:21.680 --> 00:25.820
The house had been washed away not far from the Kesennuma coast in northern Japan...

00:26.120 --> 00:29.290
...when a magnitude nine earthquake triggered a devastating tsunami.

00:30.490 --> 00:35.200
Seemingly scared by the helicopter's propellers, the dog hid under the roof of the house,...

00:35.560 --> 00:38.800
...forcing rescuers to descend and try to lure it to safety.

00:39.830 --> 00:44.510
It was eventually rescued by a coast guard boat when the helicopter reportedly ran out of fuel.

00:45.910 --> 00:50.980
Japanese broadcaster NTV said the coast guards were hoping the dog would help lead them to its owner.

00:52.080 --> 00:55.050
A massive search and recover operation is currently underway...

00:55.380 --> 00:58.050
...to find around 18,000 people still missing...

00:58.320 --> 01:01.860
...and now presumed dead, three weeks after the disaster struck.
