Hi! My name is Paul McDonald.

00:05.573 --> 00:06.937
I'm the product manager of Gmail.

00:07.474 --> 00:10.575
Over the past decade, advances like touch screen technology...

00:10.723 --> 00:13.587
...have transformed the way we interact with personal electronics.

00:14.395 --> 00:15.901
However, when it comes to e-mail,...

00:16.000 --> 00:19.307
...we still rely on outdated technologies like the keyboard and mouse.

00:19.889 --> 00:22.531
At Google, we've been thinking about how to solve this problem.

00:22.664 --> 00:25.187
And today, I'm excited to share a new development with you.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.362
We call it Gmail Motion.

00:28.086 --> 00:31.148
Using your computer's camera and a spatial tracking algorithm,...

00:31.558 --> 00:35.527
...Gmail Motion interprets physical movement and turns it into actionable commands.

00:36.291 --> 00:40.543
For example, to open a message, make a motion as if you were opening an envelope.

00:41.610 --> 00:44.154
To reply, simply point backward with your thumb.

00:44.935 --> 00:46.685
To reply all, use both hands.

00:47.759 --> 00:50.358
To send a message, lick a stamp and place it down.

00:52.924 --> 00:56.149
We've been working with experts in motion technology and semiotics...

00:56.217 --> 00:59.551
...to develop a language of movements that replaces type entirely.

01:00.165 --> 01:03.741
The movements are designed to be intuitive, ergonomic, and easy to do.

01:04.415 --> 01:08.400
Studies over the past 24 years have indicated that...

01:08.969 --> 01:13.269
...more than 80% of our total communication is body language.

01:13.386 --> 01:17.481
When you can incorporate a shake of the head, a gesture of some kind,...

01:17.893 --> 01:20.623
...you're making that communication far more effective.

01:20.910 --> 01:26.129
Our bodies did not evolve to sit at a desk in a rigid position all day...

01:26.531 --> 01:31.139
...and it is my feeling that Gmail Motion will free the regular user...

01:31.627 --> 01:35.133
...from the constraints that modern society,...

01:35.225 --> 01:38.397
...and our interface with our machines have put on the human body.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.870
We've spent a long time perfecting Gmail Motion...

01:41.132 --> 01:44.869
...and we're excited about the potential for it to help improve your e-mail experience.

01:45.697 --> 01:48.781
