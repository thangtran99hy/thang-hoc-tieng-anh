00:00.663 --> 00:01.746
We love technology.

00:02.595 --> 00:05.719
And with it, we believe that we can achieve great things.

00:06.640 --> 00:11.719
Open Planet Ideas is a place where you can collaborate to identify environmental issues,...

00:12.202 --> 00:13.795
...and then tackle them as a community...

00:14.459 --> 00:17.466
...using Sony technology in new and clever ways.

00:20.494 --> 00:24.339
The challenge will take you through different phases before we come to a final idea.

00:26.569 --> 00:29.695
Inspiration is where you can tell us what you care about...

00:30.055 --> 00:32.417
...from an environmental issue on your doorstep...

00:32.866 --> 00:34.774
...to something on the other side of the world.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.665
What inspires you to act sustainably,...

00:38.299 --> 00:41.139
...or what other smart uses of technology have caught your eye.

00:43.002 --> 00:48.140
Next, our expert panel will sort and group your inspirations into popular themes.

00:49.399 --> 00:55.054
During concepting, we want you to share your ideas on how we can use existing Sony technology...

00:55.432 --> 00:58.260
...in exciting, innovative ways to meet these challenges.

00:59.771 --> 01:02.150
Don't worry if you're feeling short of ideas yourself.

01:02.475 --> 01:05.809
You can comment, applaud, or build on other people's.

01:07.195 --> 01:10.119
The best concepts will then move on to evaluation...

01:10.652 --> 01:13.180
...where they'll be rated by this community of users,...

01:14.097 --> 01:15.739
...as well as by our expert panel.

01:16.408 --> 01:21.639
Which ideas are the most elegant, the most beneficial, or the most viable?

01:22.527 --> 01:23.833
Let us know what you think.

01:26.276 --> 01:30.971
We'll develop the final idea into a proof of concept, or even a working prototype.

01:32.003 --> 01:37.112
So if you want to work alongside Sony's engineers and WWF to make your idea a reality,...

01:37.637 --> 01:39.227
...get involved now.
