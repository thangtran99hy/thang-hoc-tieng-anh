At Sharp, our goal is to reproduce every color in the world on TV.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.770
Introducing Quattron quad-pixel technology.

00:08.140 --> 00:10.120
It adds a fourth color, yellow,...

00:10.510 --> 00:12.710
...to the standard RGB color system,...

00:12.910 --> 00:18.360
...creating a vast array of colors you can't see with your TV's three-color technology.

00:18.600 --> 00:21.270
But you can see this.

00:22.460 --> 00:23.530
Whoa!

00:24.170 --> 00:25.480
Oh my!

00:25.600 --> 00:27.000
Quattron from Sharp.

00:27.800 --> 00:29.380
You have to see it, to see it.
