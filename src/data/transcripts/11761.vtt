Hi, I'm Bruce Tripido, Associate Vice President of Product Marketing here at Sharp Electronics.

00:08.475 --> 00:13.501
And we're here at our CES booth and two of our primary themes here at the booth for 2011...

00:13.581 --> 00:21.305
...are Quattron technology. Quattron is Sharp's four color technology for LCD TVs.

00:21.733 --> 00:24.931
We're the only manufacturer that has the four color technology.

00:25.428 --> 00:30.398
And our other theme this year is making bigger better with Quattron technology.

00:30.964 --> 00:35.440
So Sharp is launching this 70 - inch class screen size here at the show.

00:36.191 --> 00:42.670
All told in 2011, we'll have about five series of 70 - inch class TVs.

00:43.627 --> 00:51.230
The models that we're looking at here, these are 70 - inch full array LED with backlight,...

00:51.865 --> 00:53.695
...with local dimming capability.

00:54.459 --> 01:00.383
These are all connected TVs with our most up-to-date wireless connected platform.

01:01.804 --> 01:06.637
Some of our higher end 70 - inch TVs have 3D capabilities as well as 240 hertz.

01:07.147 --> 01:09.109
And the primary message, as you can see here,...

01:09.523 --> 01:11.895
...is that Quattron technology makes bigger better.
