You hear this often:...

00:10.551 --> 00:13.697
...check with your doctor before you start a new exercise program.

00:14.197 --> 00:16.768
A new study shows the wisdom of that advice.

00:18.886 --> 00:23.622
Each year, millions of people find themselves in the emergency room after a heart attack,...

00:23.985 --> 00:28.472
...because they overdid it during an exercise routine or a bout of lovemaking.

00:29.062 --> 00:33.410
Regular cardiovascular exercise reduces the risk of heart problems.

00:33.828 --> 00:35.717
But for the couch potatoes of the world,...

00:36.116 --> 00:41.375
...suddenly launching into a cardio program, or having sex can lead to a heart attack.

00:42.159 --> 00:46.669
Doctors at Tufts University Medical Center in Boston studied the problem...

00:47.051 --> 00:51.769
...and found a direct link between exercise and heart attack for these patients.

00:52.557 --> 00:59.575
Doctors Jessica Paulus and Issa Dahabreh reviewed 14 studies of the exercise - heart attack connection...

01:00.194 --> 01:04.591
...mostly involving men between the ages of 55 and 64.

01:04.864 --> 01:10.837
For those individuals who are unaccustomed to regular physical activity or who did not typically exercise,...

01:11.379 --> 01:16.597
...this risk was much higher than for those individuals who were regular exercisers.

01:17.285 --> 01:23.572
The study showed the greatest risk is during the activity and for up to two hours afterwards.

01:24.033 --> 01:27.672
But should anyone interpret this as an excuse not to exercise,...

01:28.163 --> 01:30.417
...Dr. Paulus says they should think again.

01:30.573 --> 01:35.587
If they are unaccustomed to exercising but they'd like to start becoming more physically active,...

01:36.064 --> 01:40.146
...they should do so very gradually and under the care and supervision of a physician.

01:40.285 --> 01:46.365
Dr. Dahabreh points out that regular exercise is good even for people who have a high risk for heart attack...

01:46.830 --> 01:52.416
...because it conditions the heart to beat more slowly during a strenuous workout or sexual activity.

01:52.771 --> 01:56.925
People who would exercise frequently, regularly, several times per week...

01:57.428 --> 02:02.271
...will tend to have a much smaller increase while they are involved in these specific activities.

02:02.533 --> 02:06.193
The study appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
