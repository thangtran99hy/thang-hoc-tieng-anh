Etiquette states that you can receive and give your name card with one hand.

00:15.129 --> 00:22.187
Especially, you find that in Americans, they don't give their name cards with two hands.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.480
They usually give it out with one hand only.

00:25.731 --> 00:30.507
And it is not even at the beginning of an acquaintance, it could be at the end...

00:31.466 --> 00:32.577
...or sometimes in the middle.

00:34.293 --> 00:38.109
But when you give or receive your name card with two hands,...

00:38.195 --> 00:41.517
...it actually means that you're very well-mannered.

00:46.401 --> 00:54.533
And read the designation, maybe even, whether they have an e-mail address or direct contact,...

00:56.078 --> 00:59.741
...'cause you need all of these to follow up with your clients.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.719
'Cause if you don't have, let's say, a mobile phone,...

01:03.357 --> 01:04.873
...that's printed on the name card,...

01:05.239 --> 01:07.277
...you might find it difficult to reach this person.

01:07.633 --> 01:13.058
And you might want to even find out if you can have their mobile number,...

01:13.248 --> 01:14.451
...but you have to ask nicely.

01:15.165 --> 01:17.802
"I noticed that you didn't place your cellphone number."

01:18.334 --> 01:23.969
"Is it possible for me to reach you other than your direct office number?"

01:25.427 --> 01:27.378
So that people don't feel that you have an agenda.

01:27.483 --> 01:29.101
"Why do you want my cellphone number? For what?"

01:30.591 --> 01:33.680
But rather, "If I cannot reach you at your direct office line,..."

01:33.788 --> 01:36.243
"...is there another number that I could reach you?"

01:37.181 --> 01:38.638
That would be a very nice favor.
