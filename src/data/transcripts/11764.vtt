00:12.513 --> 00:13.556
I took your advice.

00:14.077 --> 00:15.906
It was very good advice.

00:16.653 --> 00:17.781
Sean? Sean?

00:19.350 --> 00:21.951
Look, I can see that you think you know me but I don't know who you are.

00:22.048 --> 00:23.931
My name is Captain Colter Stevens.

00:24.017 --> 00:25.221
You're kind of freaking me out.

00:31.717 --> 00:32.837
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:34.712 --> 00:35.677
Talk to me, Sean.

00:35.761 --> 00:38.163
Look, I don't know who Sean is and I don't know who you are.

00:45.569 --> 00:46.829
Welcome back Captain Stevens.

00:46.975 --> 00:47.533
Where am I?

00:47.987 --> 00:49.653
You are inside the Source Code.

00:49.769 --> 00:50.539
What is the Source Code?

00:51.415 --> 00:53.107
It's a computer program, Captain.

00:53.920 --> 00:59.492
Source Code enables you to cross over into another man's identity in the last eight minutes of his life.

01:00.594 --> 01:05.733
At 7:48 this morning, a bomb exploded on a train outside of Chicago killing everyone on board.

01:06.380 --> 01:08.791
A man named Sean Fentress was on that train.

01:08.994 --> 01:10.547
He is now you.

01:11.528 --> 01:12.851
Think Captain, remember back.

01:13.054 --> 01:13.916
Who bombed the train?

01:14.053 --> 01:15.561
I don't know who bombed the train!

01:15.640 --> 01:16.357
Then try again.

01:16.463 --> 01:16.973
Wait, no.

01:19.525 --> 01:20.649
So, what do you think?

01:20.779 --> 01:22.362
It's the same train but it's different.

01:23.653 --> 01:26.243
We've been informed there'll be another attack in six hours.

01:26.737 --> 01:29.775
If you find the bomber, the next attack can be prevented.

01:30.091 --> 01:31.868
Concentrate on the passengers in your car.

01:32.035 --> 01:34.154
Look for ones who seem nervous.

01:34.247 --> 01:35.451
As always you will have eight minutes.

01:35.594 --> 01:37.349
Eight minutes, and then I blow up again.

01:38.827 --> 01:41.855
What would you do if you knew you had less than eight minutes to live?

01:42.024 --> 01:43.693
I'd make those seconds count.

01:45.312 --> 01:46.251
I wanna go back in.

01:46.393 --> 01:47.203
I'm gonna save her.

01:47.576 --> 01:49.103
You can't, it doesn't work that way.

01:49.177 --> 01:50.158
Christina is dead.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.246
She doesn't have to be.

01:52.794 --> 01:56.321
You cannot alter this reality while inside the Source Code.

01:57.007 --> 01:59.987
I'm asking you to have the decency to let me try.

02:07.895 --> 02:08.614
What's going on?

02:08.763 --> 02:09.281
He's in trouble.

02:09.955 --> 02:11.175
Tell me everything's gonna be okay.

02:11.358 --> 02:12.655
Everything's gonna be okay.
