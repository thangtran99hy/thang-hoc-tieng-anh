Next year, our parent company, Sharp Corporation of Japan, will celebrate...

00:07.250 --> 00:09.800
...its 100th year anniversary.

00:10.800 --> 00:18.600
And in preparation for this milestone, we have set two business visions:...

00:19.670 --> 00:28.810
...the first is, contribute to the world with an environment and health conscious business,...

00:29.320 --> 00:35.370
...focusing on energy saving and energy creating products.

00:36.690 --> 00:42.360
You have been hearing this message from Sharp for several years now...

00:43.590 --> 00:48.270
...and we take this very, very seriously.

00:49.730 --> 00:53.840
Achieving goals takes time and focus.

00:55.100 --> 01:03.530
You will see the result of this focus in almost all the products we sell today.

01:04.560 --> 01:17.650
For example, Sharp is a world leader in solar energy which creates green renewable power.

01:18.810 --> 01:28.340
And most of the products we create are among the most energy efficient in their categories.

01:29.610 --> 01:40.990
Our second vision is to contribute to ubiquitous society with one of a kind LCDs.

01:41.930 --> 01:51.830
What we mean is that, we are increasingly connecting to each other through digital devices,...

01:52.290 --> 02:02.850
...and Sharp LCDs serve as the windows and remote control for our digital lives.

02:04.070 --> 02:10.190
Sharp has always been at the forefront of LCD technology...

02:11.010 --> 02:17.110
...and we continue to invest in the future of LCD.

02:17.910 --> 02:27.050
For example, last November, we had a privilege of installing a 3x3 Sharp video wall,...

02:28.130 --> 02:36.880
...like the one behind me, in the windows of the 9/11 memorial preview site in New York City.

02:38.150 --> 02:47.650
The public display is visible from the street and features rendering of the memorial and museum...

02:48.270 --> 02:52.680
...and the official 9/11 memorial opening day counter.

02:53.780 --> 03:01.010
So you see, Sharp is already a window to the connected world...

03:01.740 --> 03:05.340
...and this trend is just beginning.
