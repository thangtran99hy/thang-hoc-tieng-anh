Hi, this is Paul Reagasmerf of Sharp Electronics. I'm the national account manager for distribution.

00:09.790 --> 00:13.300
And what you're looking at here is what we call our i3 wall,...

00:13.680 --> 00:21.210
...which is an array of 64 60 - inch full array LED panels with 720p resolution.

00:21.930 --> 00:28.160
The bezel, as you can see, is super thin. It's a 6.5 millimeter or 3/8 of an inch.

00:28.630 --> 00:32.690
And what we're doing is we have 16 media players, which each media player...

00:33.090 --> 00:38.790
...is sending the signal or the content to four panels. So that has to be into 64 panels.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.110
And then, the software that you're seeing now...
