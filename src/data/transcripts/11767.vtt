00:07.840 --> 00:11.140
You know, I bet people think that we're gonna talk about this cool...

00:11.670 --> 00:13.780
...Sharp Aquos television here.

00:13.940 --> 00:14.810
Look at this TV.

00:14.910 --> 00:15.510
But we're not.

00:15.940 --> 00:20.550
We are not. We're actually talking about something much smaller, 5.5 inches to be exact.

00:20.680 --> 00:21.420
That we are.

00:21.820 --> 00:26.420
The Galapagos E-Media Tablet Reader thing.

00:27.460 --> 00:31.090
It's an e-reader, it has its own store for books.

00:31.230 --> 00:32.060
It's not here yet.

00:32.160 --> 00:33.450
It's not. It's in Japan though.

00:33.550 --> 00:37.400
It's in Japan and it's coming to the US in the second, third quarter...

00:37.610 --> 00:38.170
...this year.

00:38.300 --> 00:39.500
It's gonna run Android.

00:39.830 --> 00:42.600
Right. But now in Japan it's running a Linux system.

00:42.750 --> 00:48.580
Well, so the idea here is that you're on the couch watching TV...

00:48.680 --> 00:51.750
...and you're getting sleepy but you don't wanna stop what you're watching...

00:51.910 --> 00:53.880
...but you kinda wanna get in bed, right?

00:54.020 --> 00:54.750
Yeah, I wanna go to bed.

00:54.850 --> 00:58.890
Yeah, so, you're watching on the big screen TV and now you wanna go to bed...

00:59.050 --> 01:00.590
...so all you do is...

01:00.890 --> 01:05.360
...right here, you gonna take a little swipe and we're gonna steal, hey, hey!

01:05.830 --> 01:07.760
That's mine. Don't touch, don't touch.

01:08.430 --> 01:10.400
So actually what's gonna happen is the TV,...

01:10.770 --> 01:11.230
Look at that.

01:11.330 --> 01:15.040
...you saw it. It disappeared from the big screen, now it is on the tablet,...

01:15.400 --> 01:18.410
...and you can send it over to a phone as well.

01:18.570 --> 01:21.540
Yeah, what if you wanted to leave the house? I no longer wanna be in bed...

01:21.640 --> 01:24.050
...now I wanna take my phone and go. Now, what we'll do...

01:24.310 --> 01:27.580
...is we'll swipe it right on over to the phone.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.720
It's gonna pop on over here in a second.

01:30.520 --> 01:34.020
It'll be available third, fourth quarter of this year.

01:34.120 --> 01:35.520
I thought they said second or third.

01:35.920 --> 01:36.790
No, third or fourth.

01:36.890 --> 01:37.750
I'm doing it wrong.

01:38.030 --> 01:39.390
You're doing it wrong.

01:39.860 --> 01:41.350
It helps with your microphone on.

01:42.500 --> 01:48.040
We've actually been playing with it and it's pretty cool so the idea is to share your devices...

01:48.340 --> 01:51.210
...and all of that content on your devices. I'm liking it.

01:51.310 --> 01:52.110
I like it too.

01:52.210 --> 01:55.980
No pricing just yet but we'll keep you updated as we find that out.
