00:00.317 --> 00:02.187
Ok. So, it's $37.08.

00:02.673 --> 00:03.504
Paper or plastic?

00:03.766 --> 00:04.175
Plastic.

00:04.585 --> 00:05.263
That's the magic word.

00:05.497 --> 00:06.203
Green Police.

00:06.998 --> 00:09.425
You picked the wrong day to mess with the ecosystem, plastic boy.

00:12.171 --> 00:12.624
Battery!

00:12.965 --> 00:13.250
Battery.

00:13.358 --> 00:14.575
Let's go, take the house. Come on!

00:15.989 --> 00:17.771
Put the rind down, sir!

00:18.164 --> 00:19.624
That's a compost infraction.

00:23.171 --> 00:25.609
Whoa! Did you install these bulbs?

00:26.396 --> 00:26.680
Yeah.

00:26.915 --> 00:28.185
Tragedy strikes tonight...

00:28.333 --> 00:31.831
...where a man has just been arrested for possession of an incandescent light bulb.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.937
What do you guys think about plastic bottles now?

00:34.391 --> 00:36.321
The water setting is at 105.

00:42.309 --> 00:43.536
We've got a TDI here.

00:43.797 --> 00:44.389
Clean diesel.

00:44.539 --> 00:45.340
You're good to go, sir!

00:55.347 --> 00:56.376
Good afternoon, officers!

00:56.721 --> 00:58.069
Are those foam cups you're drinking from?

00:58.167 --> 00:58.242
Yeah?

00:58.427 --> 01:00.063
Can you please step out of the car and put them on the hood?
