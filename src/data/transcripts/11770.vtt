Libyan rebels and forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi traded fire Thursday, as the rebels tried to regroup after a hectic retreat.

00:17.483 --> 00:22.139
Pentagon officials estimate a naval bombing campaign has degraded the Libyan military.

00:22.554 --> 00:25.713
But loyalist forces are still not close to the breaking point.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.145
US Defense Secretary Robert Gates.

00:28.479 --> 00:32.820
Deposing the Gadhafi regime, as welcome as that eventuality would be,...

00:32.993 --> 00:34.936
...is not part of the military mission.

00:35.885 --> 00:40.077
In my view, the removal of Colonel Gadhafi will likely be achieved over time...

00:40.172 --> 00:43.363
...through political and economic measures and by his own people.

00:43.819 --> 00:50.807
Gates' testimony before Congress came as US media reported that the CIA has sent teams into Libya to help the rebels.

00:51.267 --> 00:54.551
Reports say operatives are gathering intelligence for air strikes,...

00:54.634 --> 00:57.967
...and to make contact with rebel groups trying to oust Mr. Gadhafi.

00:58.417 --> 01:02.781
I can't speak to any CIA activities.

01:03.555 --> 01:09.193
But I will tell you that the president has been quite clear that in terms of the United States military,...

01:09.279 --> 01:11.013
...there will be no boots on the ground.

01:11.456 --> 01:15.664
The Pentagon estimates the Libyan government has 15 to 20 thousand troops...

01:15.929 --> 01:19.238
...while the rebels have about 1000 fighters with military training.

01:19.907 --> 01:24.387
Some members of Congress are concerned. They were not consulted about the decision to attack Libya...

01:24.799 --> 01:27.697
...and asked Secretary Gates to define a successful mission there.

01:28.036 --> 01:36.002
I think a policy success would be the removal of the Gadhafi regime...

01:37.485 --> 01:44.340
...and at least the beginnings of the emergence of a more or less democratic government in Tripoli.

01:44.907 --> 01:48.853
Gates says as NATO takes complete control of operations over Libya,...

01:48.939 --> 01:52.017
...the US military will significantly reduce its presence.

01:52.500 --> 01:56.337
There have been calls to train the lightly armed rebels and supply them with weapons.

01:56.765 --> 01:59.847
But Gates says that type of support should come from another country.

02:00.301 --> 02:03.889
If there is gonna be that kind of assistance to the opposition,...

02:04.361 --> 02:07.024
...there are plenty of sources for it other than the United States.

02:07.163 --> 02:11.526
Gates comments came as Mr. Gadhafi's soldiers struck back at the rebels this week,...

02:11.604 --> 02:16.358
...recapturing lost ground and triggering calls for help from battered opposition forces.

02:16.893 --> 02:19.241
