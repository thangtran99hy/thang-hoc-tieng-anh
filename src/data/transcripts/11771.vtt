I think probably, the earliest you can get of the kids involved in Star Wars, the better.

00:15.715 --> 00:17.139
I explain to my son that the Force...

00:17.647 --> 00:21.553
...is a mysterious power that flows through all of us that binds us all together.

00:22.434 --> 00:24.571
There is a light side and a dark side to the Force.

00:24.667 --> 00:26.895
Sometimes the dark side looks kind of attractive.

00:26.991 --> 00:29.333
You have to discuss those issues around that;...

00:29.518 --> 00:31.956
...annihilating planets, definitely not a good thing.

00:32.047 --> 00:35.143
But, you know, the Force can cause you to do all kinds of crazy things.

00:35.621 --> 00:39.069
There's a few very important things that I think he needs to realize growing up.

00:39.299 --> 00:41.958
One, it's that Han Solo shot first.

00:42.478 --> 00:46.193
I don't really want my son growing up in a world where we believe Greedo shot first.

00:46.300 --> 00:48.519
A lot of kids in the playground like Jar Jar Binks.

00:50.064 --> 00:54.195
We're gonna keep her Jar Jar Binks - free for as long as possible.

00:54.409 --> 00:56.542
You have to start with the original three films...

00:57.081 --> 01:01.011
...and work your way back towards the newer ones, which is how it was intended to be.

01:01.333 --> 01:04.830
I want her to have the same feeling that I did...

01:06.046 --> 01:14.975
...when she's watching "Empire" and it's revealed by Vader that he is Luke Skywalker's father.

01:15.181 --> 01:19.608
Many other Star Wars aficionados have taken issue with my decisions to tell my son...

01:20.045 --> 01:21.975
...that Darth Vader is, in fact, Luke's father.

01:22.521 --> 01:25.629
But until you've walked a mile in my shoes, unless you were there that day...

01:25.975 --> 01:27.007
...when he asked the question...

01:27.335 --> 01:30.295
...and he had a little book with the pictures and he wanted to know,...

01:30.838 --> 01:31.946
...I didn't know what else to tell him.

01:32.275 --> 01:33.886
So, I told him that Darth Vader is Luke's Father.

01:34.531 --> 01:37.307
Does that make me a bad father? Probably.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.299
He's not his father.

01:41.003 --> 01:42.289
It wasn't like this when I was a kid.

01:42.809 --> 01:44.909
The movies were unveiling themselves to me...

01:45.023 --> 01:47.537
...in periods of like three or more years, one after the other.

01:47.981 --> 01:51.090
It wasn't this wealth of information just like smacking me in the face.

01:51.539 --> 01:52.887
My parents didn't have to deal with this.

01:53.135 --> 01:55.924
All you can do is hope really with anything else.

01:57.085 --> 02:01.596
You just hope that they remember everything that they were taught and they use it.

02:02.329 --> 02:05.127
I didn't start early enough with this one. I wish I had.
