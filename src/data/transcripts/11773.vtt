I know a lot of people here are going.

00:04.450 --> 00:08.820
And the next question is about your tour. So Gagafame11 from the UK asks,...

00:09.190 --> 00:13.610
"Do you have any funny stories to tell about things that have happened backstage at the Monster Ball?"

00:14.250 --> 00:18.440
There are lots of funny things that happened backstage at the Monster Ball.

00:21.060 --> 00:24.510
I don't like surprises and I don't like pranks.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.540
I'm sure you can maybe tell that just from...

00:29.260 --> 00:33.120
But I don't like pranks. But I actually, with me, have brought...

00:33.570 --> 00:36.570
...all my friends from New York City on tour with me. So...

00:37.010 --> 00:42.470
...I have had very few, I should say, famous acts opening. It's been mostly...

00:43.040 --> 00:47.050
...really underground bands and DJs that I've known since I was 18 years old.

00:47.190 --> 00:50.210
So there's a lot of backstage shenanigans.

00:50.740 --> 00:54.970
Very often they make jokes about my diet 'cause they know I have to stay fit...

00:55.130 --> 01:00.020
...for music videos, so they'll leave like mounds of cheese burgers and stuff in my dressing room.

01:00.330 --> 01:01.130
It's really awful.

01:05.040 --> 01:06.390
Vicious, vicious.
