In 1987, Starbucks had 11 stores and 100 employees,...

00:05.157 --> 00:11.619
...and we had this dream to create a national brand around coffee and a unique experience in our stores... 

00:12.187 --> 00:16.957
...that, hopefully, we would be able to extend from the West Coast to around the country. 

00:17.713 --> 00:21.757
And from that point on, the dream started becoming a reality,... 

00:22.373 --> 00:24.189
...and it almost had a life of its own. 

00:24.435 --> 00:29.757
Almost everything we did worked, as we built this very unique brand around coffee.

00:30.289 --> 00:34.873
And a very, I think also unique, values - based organization...

00:35.100 --> 00:36.571
...around the culture and values of the company.

00:36.961 --> 00:40.125
When you look at growth as a strategy,... 

00:40.705 --> 00:44.643
...it becomes somewhat seductive, addictive. 

00:45.000 --> 00:48.297
But growth should not be, and is not a strategy: it's a tactic.

00:48.719 --> 00:56.288
The primary lesson that I've learned over the years is that growth and success can cover up a lot of mistakes.

00:56.719 --> 01:01.027
When we came back, and I reviewed some of the underperforming stores,...

01:01.575 --> 01:06.263
...I was horrified to learn that the stores that we ultimately had to close,...

01:06.511 --> 01:08.278
...had been open less than 18 months.

01:09.443 --> 01:10.783
And when you look at that,...

01:11.100 --> 01:13.611
...the money invested and the money that we had to write off,...

01:14.469 --> 01:16.452
...those decisions were made with a lack of discipline...

01:16.925 --> 01:22.467
...that in part, were kind of complicit with the stock price.

01:22.846 --> 01:28.450
And that's also I think, a very, very dangerous road to go down.

01:28.867 --> 01:30.406
We've learned a great, great lesson.

01:30.963 --> 01:34.547
And now, as we return the company to growth,...

01:34.947 --> 01:37.926
...it'll be disciplined, profitable growth for the right reasons. 

01:38.286 --> 01:40.993
And a different kind of growth as the company has matured,...

01:41.353 --> 01:43.039
...and most importantly, we've learned this lesson.
