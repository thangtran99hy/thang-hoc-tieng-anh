Where were you the first time you heard one of your songs on the radio?

00:04.410 --> 00:05.450
I was in Canada...

00:08.680 --> 00:11.340
...and I'll never forget it. But it's a very different,...

00:11.510 --> 00:14.860
..and it's funny, it's almost more enjoyable now...

00:15.210 --> 00:19.570
...when I hear it for the first time on the radio because at that time in Canada I had,...

00:21.140 --> 00:22.500
...many people don't know this about me...

00:22.650 --> 00:25.540
...because it seems as though when Just Dance hit number one, it was this...

00:25.690 --> 00:30.080
...big, massive, "Oh, she became a star overnight." But, to tell you the truth, I had been...

00:30.960 --> 00:34.270
...working so hard, doing three shows at night,...

00:36.130 --> 00:39.790
...all day long going to radio stations, doing phoners.

00:40.810 --> 00:43.540
The reason we're here at Google today is because...

00:43.880 --> 00:52.640
...the original campaign for my music and my project began with online and media - based advertisements. So,...

00:53.480 --> 00:57.590
...that's really where I began. So I remember I was in Canada, and I was really tired,...

00:57.900 --> 01:03.000
...and I was about to go onstage at this outdoor performance.

01:03.140 --> 01:07.580
I actually think it was in Winnipeg, which is where Maria Aragon is from, from that video.

01:08.110 --> 01:11.990
And I remember I heard it and I started crying,...

01:12.370 --> 01:18.160
...and my tour manager David said, "How does it feel?" and I said, "It's about damn time!"

01:20.760 --> 01:24.590
And so now when it comes on, it's a little bit more of a gracious, humbling moment.

01:28.700 --> 01:33.490
So in terms of other special moments, SoLongAdelaide from Sheffield, England asks,...

01:33.610 --> 01:38.160
..."When exactly was the moment in your career when you realized you were going to be an international superstar?"

01:40.490 --> 01:42.300
I still don't feel like one.

01:44.800 --> 01:45.480
How's that possible?

01:45.620 --> 01:46.280
I just don't.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.180
I know that sounds very silly but...

01:50.710 --> 01:55.190
...even this morning I was getting ready to tweet that I was coming here today,...

01:56.040 --> 02:01.240
...and I got like 50 freakin' e-mails like, "Don't tweet it, they don't want anyone to know!"

02:10.520 --> 02:11.990
That was for your security.

02:13.080 --> 02:16.220
I guess they were worried for security, but I said, you know,...

02:17.270 --> 02:22.820
...I need to market my record. People need to know where I'm gonna be.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.980
And so everyone was saying, "Well, they know you're gonna be there, just don't tell them when."

02:28.310 --> 02:31.220
And, oh my gosh, my security is always...

02:31.390 --> 02:35.420
...they want to shoot me because I will literally leave the house...

02:36.130 --> 02:39.230
...and go to the Bodega down the street where I live in New York,...

02:39.390 --> 02:41.370
...and they're like, "Where are ya?"

02:42.700 --> 02:46.880
Because where I live, I have been hustling for so long that...

02:47.220 --> 02:52.720
...it's more just like, "You're home," you know, like everybody's so cool and I guess...

02:53.120 --> 02:55.420
...even though my first album was called, The Fame,...

02:55.940 --> 03:00.190
...that was never the ultimate goal of any of this. It was always that I just...

03:00.850 --> 03:04.800
...really am genuinely a musician to my core...

03:05.410 --> 03:07.800
...and a lot of people don't know that about me, but...

03:08.130 --> 03:10.730
...I write every lyric, every melody,..

03:10.910 --> 03:15.700
...I'm in there with the producers whipping them to make the new future of music.

03:17.390 --> 03:20.890
That is why I'm here. I'm not here to be a superstar.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.570
So yes. And no.

03:26.430 --> 03:29.440
There was never a day when I woke up and said, "I'm a superstar."

03:31.150 --> 03:33.160
I'm still waiting for that to happen.
