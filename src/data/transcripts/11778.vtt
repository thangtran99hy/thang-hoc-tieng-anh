You said that in school, a lot of people bullied you and didn't like you.

00:03.340 --> 00:07.270
Now that you're famous, have any of them tried to, quote unquote, "apologize" and become friends?

00:07.620 --> 00:09.350
If so, what did you say to them?

00:11.270 --> 00:15.580
I wouldn't say "apologize"; there's been a lot of concert ticket requests!

00:18.940 --> 00:23.050
And I think one of the most awkward things that anyone ever said to me was,...

00:24.170 --> 00:27.070
..."Well, my my. How the tables have turned."

00:30.460 --> 00:36.130
But to be honest, I don't have that kind of vengeful spirit in myself.

00:36.340 --> 00:39.040
And I never did. It was just more that,...

00:39.960 --> 00:44.720
...and I say this with so much genuineness from my heart, is that...

00:45.150 --> 00:47.130
...bullying really stays with you your whole life.

00:47.340 --> 00:50.670
And it really, really never goes away, and I know...

00:51.110 --> 00:54.690
...you're using words like "superstar" and "most Googled" and...

00:55.310 --> 00:57.550
..."billions of Youtube videos" but,...

00:57.930 --> 01:01.420
...I was never the winner; I was always the loser.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.420
And that still stays with me.

01:04.650 --> 01:10.190
And do I wanna stick it to anybody? No.

01:10.480 --> 01:11.610
I just wanna make music.
