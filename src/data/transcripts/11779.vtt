I imagine that "Born This Way" is a little bit about being yourself...

00:03.627 --> 00:05.138
...and how to overcome bullies.

00:05.237 --> 00:06.451
I don't know if you wanna talk a little bit.

00:06.565 --> 00:07.268
A little bit.

00:08.423 --> 00:11.901
What's so funny when I put that song out, because everybody was like,...

00:12.521 --> 00:14.433
..."Oh, the lyrics are so literal."

00:14.665 --> 00:15.499
And I'm like, "Yeah."

00:18.918 --> 00:23.741
When, you know, when you get bullied, you kind of try to,...

00:24.343 --> 00:27.914
...there's almost this like emotional poetry that you go through in high school.

00:28.042 --> 00:32.798
"Oh well, someday..." and you just kind of try to hide from it and be the bigger person.

00:33.692 --> 00:36.144
But "Born This Way" is about saying,...

00:36.562 --> 00:39.703
..."This is who I am. This is who I am."

00:45.295 --> 00:49.441
I mean the next single "Judas" is like this very classic Gaga record but...

00:50.236 --> 00:56.451
...more importantly, the song "Born This Way" is this like gateway drug for the album.

00:56.576 --> 01:01.420
And really trying to say in the most literal and honest way that I can,...

01:01.549 --> 01:09.107
...that when I go to the Monster Ball, I see something so fearless and so special in my fans.

01:09.423 --> 01:13.270
But I also see something afraid.

01:14.593 --> 01:15.909
Something that I was.

01:16.360 --> 01:18.503
Something that was unsure.

01:19.314 --> 01:23.287
And I really encourage people to look into the darkness...

01:23.426 --> 01:28.221
...and look into places that you would not normally look to find uniqueness and specialness...

01:28.374 --> 01:31.541
...because that's where the diamonds are hiding.

01:34.071 --> 01:35.267
I think that's a wonderful message.
