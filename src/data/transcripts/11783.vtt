And you actually are a very classically trained pianist, jazz musician,...

00:07.718 --> 00:11.918
...and one of our video questions from leopardscar20 actually is about your,...

00:12.427 --> 00:13.185
leopardscar?

00:13.963 --> 00:15.716
...leopardscar, leopardscar20,...

00:16.066 --> 00:20.155
...asking a little bit about your training ongoing, so we'll go ahead and roll that video.

00:20.335 --> 00:23.960
Hey, Gaga! This is Rudy Hernandez, one of your little monsters from Portland, Oregon.

00:24.544 --> 00:27.225
My question is, I was just wondering if you still took...

00:27.405 --> 00:30.006
...piano training and vocal training to improve your skills?

00:30.549 --> 00:32.102
Be great to hear you answer my question.

00:32.415 --> 00:35.688
I can't wait to see you again here in Portland, Oregon and paws up!

00:40.814 --> 00:43.926
Cutie! I love my fans!

00:46.337 --> 00:50.555
Yes. I actually vocally rehearse every single day.

00:51.309 --> 00:54.603
I do a 30 - minute warm-up every single day.

00:55.618 --> 01:00.023
It's been the same vocal warm-up that I've been doing since I was 11 years old.

01:00.975 --> 01:05.647
I've had my mentor, Don Lawrence, has been my voice teacher since I was 11,...

01:05.863 --> 01:07.897
...so it's over 10 years now.

01:08.835 --> 01:10.815
And in terms of piano,...

01:11.833 --> 01:14.633
...piano is funny; I mean it's kind of this thing that always stays with you.

01:14.771 --> 01:16.667
I don't know if there's any pianist in this room,...

01:17.990 --> 01:19.713
...but if you don't practice for a little while,...

01:20.097 --> 01:23.290
...and then you focus on it, you kinda get your chops back pretty quickly.

01:23.708 --> 01:29.208
So, what I do mostly for piano is I try to find time when I'm in New York City...

01:29.640 --> 01:35.995
...or on the road to do shows and have jam sessions with my band just for fun. So,...

01:36.775 --> 01:41.759
...whenever you see those really horrid photos of me looking drunk at a piano bar,...

01:42.224 --> 01:44.884
...I'm actually rehearsing.

01:47.315 --> 01:48.603
That's just how I like to rehearse.

01:48.717 --> 01:52.541
I like to have a couple martinis and play some Cole Porter,...

01:52.753 --> 01:55.564
...and that's just the way I like to learn.

01:57.465 --> 01:58.930
But stay in school!
