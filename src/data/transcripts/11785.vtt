So many people beyond just me, millions of people have been inspired by your style.

00:04.780 --> 00:07.420
And one of the fans would like to know, sirgagaOfficial...

00:07.600 --> 00:08.250
sirgaga?

00:08.530 --> 00:12.560
...would like to know, "With all the clothes you have, how do you decide what to wear every day..."

00:12.730 --> 00:14.870
"...and what happens to the garments after they're worn?"

00:17.610 --> 00:19.010
How do I decide what to wear?

00:19.160 --> 00:22.730
It's actually not quite as complicated as some of you might imagine.

00:24.990 --> 00:28.890
I sometimes, I mean, I'll plan months ahead for certain things.

00:30.960 --> 00:37.240
For example, at the Grammys, the Hussein Chalayan "vessel". Although...

00:37.450 --> 00:40.900
...it's become known as "the egg", he wants me to remind you it's "the vessel".

00:44.280 --> 00:48.810
That took months and months of conception, and I wanted to do a whole performance art piece...

00:48.940 --> 00:51.630
...that began on the red carpet and ended after the performance.

00:51.750 --> 00:58.890
So, certain things take a while, and yes, I do view the vessel as a fashion piece.

00:59.630 --> 01:03.110
But like today, I wore the same black dress...

01:03.230 --> 01:08.740
...because I wanted the fans to recognize me a certain way when I enter the Google building.

01:11.560 --> 01:14.000
And also on the topic of style, you have tattoos,...

01:14.150 --> 01:17.200
...and one of the fans noticed that they're all on your left side.

01:17.540 --> 01:21.910
So, TaylorMonster15 would like to know why all of your tattoos are on the left side of your body.

01:22.640 --> 01:26.240
It was actually per my father's request.

01:28.650 --> 01:29.610
So, tell us more.

01:29.830 --> 01:34.790
He asked that I remain, on one side, slightly normal.

01:38.930 --> 01:45.200
So I only have my tattoos on my left side. I'm also a lefty.

01:49.250 --> 01:53.790
It's funny; my father, when I was a kid, he used to try to change my hands when I was little.

01:54.140 --> 01:56.530
And the doctor would be like, "She was born that way, you can't."

01:59.440 --> 02:05.170
So, I think maybe some of it, just from a neurological standpoint, might be because...

02:05.440 --> 02:07.850
...I'm creatively driven by my left side. Maybe that's why.

02:08.050 --> 02:13.440
But he's asked that I don't get any more on the right side, for whatever reason.

02:14.950 --> 02:19.030
I think he sees this as my like, Marilyn Monroe side and this is my Iggy Pop side.
