00:00.634 --> 00:04.513
And finally, we end today's broadcast with some happy news out of Japan.

00:04.924 --> 00:07.410
The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in Tokyo.

00:07.770 --> 00:10.519
Our spectators trying to stay upbeat and thankful,...

00:10.933 --> 00:13.304
...one thing the quake and tsunami didn't destroy.

00:13.652 --> 00:14.151
Let's take a look.

00:15.415 --> 00:18.243
Tokyo's cherry blossom trees bloomed on Monday.

00:18.680 --> 00:22.777
The event usually kicks off a two - week frenzy of festivities under the blossoms.

00:23.299 --> 00:24.916
But this year, the mood is somber.

00:25.502 --> 00:28.420
The blossoms not only arrived six days later than usual,...

00:28.889 --> 00:33.093
...but also amid a nuclear crisis that has cast a shadow amongst residents.

00:33.672 --> 00:36.501
But some residents found solace in the arrival of spring.

00:38.230 --> 00:40.434
There is no point in being depressed all the time.

00:40.735 --> 00:43.926
So I think we should just take a walk outside as it cheers you up.

00:45.933 --> 00:48.886
Others contemplate at cancelling their cherry blossom events...

00:48.921 --> 00:53.890
...for fear of being seen as insensitive towards the quake and tsunami survivors struggling to recover.

00:54.163 --> 00:57.603
But they've decided that it was better to celebrate the happiness of the moment.

00:58.853 --> 01:01.156
We had been planning this for the past three months.

01:01.433 --> 01:03.633
And we hesitated initially to follow through...

01:03.972 --> 01:08.041
...but I wanted to capture my daughter's smile and wanted to make great memories.

01:10.787 --> 01:13.150
Ever since, the flower represents Japan...

01:13.270 --> 01:18.739
...and I think the Japanese see the cherry blossoms as symbolizing the need to go back to basics in life.

01:20.871 --> 01:24.475
The cherry blossoms are usually in full bloom for about a week.
