How exciting, or daunting, or whatever it is to know that you're stepping into these very famous red boots?

00:16.818 --> 00:17.900
Yeah, extremely exciting.

00:18.052 --> 00:19.691
I mean, the opportunity of a lifetime.

00:19.809 --> 00:23.583
Everyone has, at some point, pretended to be Superman as a boy...

00:23.718 --> 00:27.835
...and I get the opportunity to play this enormous icon.

00:28.247 --> 00:31.150
So, I'm ecstatic, obviously.

00:31.423 --> 00:34.413
I'm very excited and I really can't wait to get my teeth sunk into the whole thing.

00:34.800 --> 00:35.993
And, you know, get things going.

00:36.365 --> 00:40.215
I first learned your name when the Bond stuff was going on.

00:40.626 --> 00:45.137
Now, Craig only has like, I think he said, only one or two more films.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.920
As you said, you're only 27, would you still be interested?

00:48.324 --> 00:50.378
Of course, James Bond? Yeah.

00:50.727 --> 00:52.112
Yeah, that's the other one to get.

00:52.693 --> 00:54.055
You get Superman, you get James Bond.
