I'm so frustrated because of my dad.

00:06.964 --> 00:09.596
He was watching TV and I asked him a question,...

00:09.699 --> 00:10.753
...but he couldn't hear me!

00:11.333 --> 00:14.739
In my opinion, men can't do two things at the same time.

00:15.199 --> 00:17.362
I guess men are just wired differently.

00:17.923 --> 00:20.463
Women can do multiple things at the same time!

00:20.827 --> 00:26.541
For example, I can talk on the phone, watch TV, cook something, answer the door if the doorbell rings...

00:26.689 --> 00:27.854
...all at the same time!

00:28.841 --> 00:31.650
Hmm, actually, you've got something there.

00:31.883 --> 00:33.219
My dad is the same way;...

00:33.902 --> 00:36.386
...I guess I'm the same way too, as far as that goes.

00:36.751 --> 00:39.603
Anyway, it's wonderful that you can multitask.

00:39.932 --> 00:43.117
It seems to me that men and women use different parts of their brains.

00:43.803 --> 00:48.349
Or maybe some parts of the brain are more developed in women than in men, or vice versa.

00:49.027 --> 00:50.360
There is nothing you can do about it!

00:50.851 --> 00:52.795
Men can only do one thing at a time.
