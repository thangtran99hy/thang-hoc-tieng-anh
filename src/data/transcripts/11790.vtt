How do you come up with your video ideas?

00:01.914 --> 00:04.580
Every time I watch them I am stunned by the creativity and meaning.

00:04.829 --> 00:07.815
I love you Lady Gaga, StribbyDoo, your little monster.

00:07.947 --> 00:08.639
Scooby-doo?

00:08.819 --> 00:09.529
StribbyDoo.

00:09.619 --> 00:10.507
StribbyDoo!

00:13.841 --> 00:19.355
It's good old faithful. I'm a creative person, and I just always...

00:19.737 --> 00:21.768
...at some point the idea comes to me, and...

00:22.679 --> 00:28.120
...the most important thing I think with creativity is that you honor your creativity and that you don't...

00:28.921 --> 00:36.683
...ever ignore it, or go against what that creative image is telling you,...

00:36.776 --> 00:39.498
...because of what society is projecting on you.

00:39.882 --> 00:43.888
I remember when I called Troy Carter, my manager, from Amsterdam, and I was like,...

00:44.529 --> 00:49.959
"I wanna be on a government-owned alien territory in space...

00:50.052 --> 00:53.216
...and I wanna be giving birth to my own head."

00:55.101 --> 00:57.697
I just wanted to ask you about the kaleidoscope at the start of Born This Way.

00:57.765 --> 01:03.063
You know, you'll hear the bzzz, and he was like, "Why?",...

01:03.139 --> 01:07.214
...and I said, "Because I see myself and my fans...

01:07.285 --> 01:10.381
...and I feel that they give birth to me, and I give birth to them and..."

01:10.619 --> 01:16.300
"...the egg symbolizes the race of the future which bears no prejudice." So, I have my own...

01:17.316 --> 01:21.633
...and then I'm showing him Francis Bacon photos, which is like, you know...

01:22.491 --> 01:24.435
...bleeding imagery, and he's like, "I don't get it!" You know?

01:28.261 --> 01:31.891
We worked with Nick Knight on that video. If you think I'm bad, Nick Knight is, whew!

01:32.019 --> 01:36.202
He is so smart, I'm just like, "Nick I love you, but I don't understand what you're saying!"

01:40.987 --> 01:42.461
Like just the other night, last night actually,...

01:42.532 --> 01:45.145
...I was laying in bed and I had this idea for an outfit,...

01:45.403 --> 01:49.679
...and I just made myself get up and I sketched it real fast and I went back to sleep.

01:49.819 --> 01:54.729
I think it's when you say, "Oh, I'm too tired let me just go to bed."

01:54.822 --> 01:58.191
That's when the creativity stops coming, it's when you,...

01:58.988 --> 02:02.054
...you know, if God calls you, pick up the damn phone! "Hello?"...

02:05.970 --> 02:06.657
"I'm listening."
