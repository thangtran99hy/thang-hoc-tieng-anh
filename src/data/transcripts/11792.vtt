There's also so many fan remixes and remakes of your songs on YouTube.

00:04.970 --> 00:07.850
I was wondering if you have a favorite there. I know there's Maria,...

00:08.060 --> 00:12.350
...the young girl who I think really embodies a lot of what is interesting about technology.

00:13.170 --> 00:20.430
Maria is just so special and you know she's like ten years old.

00:20.960 --> 00:25.940
But even ten year olds today know how to work a webcam and upload a YouTube video, you know?

00:26.380 --> 00:35.470
And I think that is why, for myself, my campaign and my album has been so successful...

00:35.710 --> 00:42.550
...is because, I too, am a child of the dot-com era. Me and my father ran an Internet company...

00:42.980 --> 00:48.160
...when I was really young, so I was listening to lots of technology...

00:48.690 --> 00:50.870
...talk, jargon over the dinner table,...

00:51.480 --> 00:54.020
...not understanding 'til much later what it all meant.

00:56.840 --> 01:01.890
She's beautiful. She's very young and she has a voice in the world and she...

01:02.540 --> 01:09.580
...latched onto a song that was very risky for me to put out so soon in my career.

01:10.170 --> 01:12.940
But if I could just touch maybe ten...

01:13.560 --> 01:17.710
...ten year olds in the world in every single continent, maybe I could make a difference.

01:17.940 --> 01:20.890
Do we have the Maria video? I think it would be good for people to see it.

01:21.130 --> 01:22.670
I think we may have it queued up.

02:29.090 --> 02:30.670
She's just so amazing!

02:34.910 --> 02:39.950
What I would like to speak about is the way that we experience music now.

02:40.150 --> 02:45.190
We experience the music through the Internet but it has really great effects,...

02:45.390 --> 02:49.750
...and it also has really negative effects. The great effect is Maria.

02:50.490 --> 02:58.570
The negative effect is you sort of, quite mathematically input your songs and your soul into a computer,...

02:58.870 --> 03:01.400
...and out spits out charts.

03:05.880 --> 03:12.230
So the fan experience now, digitally, is they buy the song...

03:12.400 --> 03:16.400
...and then they get into chat rooms and they watch the song climb a chart.

03:17.180 --> 03:22.580
But somebody like Maria has no pretension. She's wildly innocent and beautiful...

03:22.840 --> 03:25.110
...and she only cares about the music and the lyrics.

03:25.600 --> 03:31.680
So what I'm working on doing now is creating a fan experience with the release of "Born This Way,"...

03:31.990 --> 03:37.020
...that takes them a bit away from the computer in terms of the actual purchase of the song.

03:37.880 --> 03:42.440
I want to encourage the fans to experience the music and the lyrics...

03:43.980 --> 03:52.960
...removed of that sort of behind the computer banter.

03:53.340 --> 03:56.460
When I was a kid, I was standing outside of HMV,...

03:57.010 --> 04:04.610
...praying that I saw Billy Joe's fingernail in the window, wanted to get my Green Day CD signed.

04:04.820 --> 04:09.820
I was hoping that I would see Thom Yorke when Radiohead came in.

04:09.990 --> 04:13.440
You know, that is what I wanna recreate for my fans.

04:13.700 --> 04:19.550
We've done it with the Monster Ball and now I wanna do it with album retail.
