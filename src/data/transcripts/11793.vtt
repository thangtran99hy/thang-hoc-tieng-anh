Does the Movie Always Faithfully Represent the Book?

00:04.439 --> 00:10.079
It does not seem easy to create an outstanding movie on the silver screen out of an outstanding book.

00:10.755 --> 00:12.664
Sometimes, the movie is better than the book,...

00:13.110 --> 00:14.567
...or at least as good as the book.

00:15.211 --> 00:19.241
But other times, though the movie says "based on the story written by..."

00:19.554 --> 00:22.761
...it is very different from the book, in a not - so - good way.

00:23.511 --> 00:26.239
A good example is the movie "Starship Troopers".

00:26.737 --> 00:28.855
My friend read the book with the same title.

00:29.575 --> 00:34.233
When we were college students, it was announced that a movie was going to be made from this book.

00:34.700 --> 00:39.588
And he was extremely excited and looked forward to the movie's release with great anticipation.

00:40.374 --> 00:43.376
But when he saw the movie, he was very disappointed.

00:44.249 --> 00:45.491
The book is science fiction,...

00:45.969 --> 00:49.725
...but is thick on political discourse and philosophical hypothesis,...

00:50.331 --> 00:54.651
...and discusses moral responsibilities to become a good member of modern society.

00:55.373 --> 01:01.191
But the movie was shallow and did not touch on the deeper insights into life issues highlighted by the book.

01:02.029 --> 01:06.097
Although there are many constraints a director faces when going from a book to a movie,...

01:06.561 --> 01:12.848
...I think the biggest obstacle preventing a movie from faithfully representing the book it's based on, is the director himself.

01:13.451 --> 01:16.135
Creative license to change the story is understandable,...

01:16.619 --> 01:21.337
...but going overboard is sure to disappoint those who have read the book before seeing the movie.
