00:04.108 --> 00:05.438
I'll watch the kids today.

00:05.694 --> 00:07.755
Why don't you just go relax or something?

00:08.390 --> 00:09.690
I can see that you're tired.

00:09.835 --> 00:12.753
It wouldn't be anything for me to take care of the dishes as well.

00:13.134 --> 00:17.275
As a matter of fact, while I'm at it, I might as well do the wash for you, too.

00:17.979 --> 00:19.623
It's what husbands are for, right?

00:20.546 --> 00:22.369
Isn't this what wives want to hear?

00:23.038 --> 00:26.569
Although husbands don't need to do all the above things all at once,...

00:26.993 --> 00:31.558
...imagine how good a wife would feel if her husband did some of them on a regular basis.

00:32.123 --> 00:37.131
My father, for example, always does the dishes because my mother always does the cooking.

00:37.669 --> 00:39.289
It's a win-win situation.

00:39.871 --> 00:43.127
He doesn't like cooking, and she doesn't like doing the dishes.

00:44.035 --> 00:46.269
Let's look at the flip side of the same coin.

00:46.832 --> 00:49.157
The husband returns from a hard day of work.

00:49.716 --> 00:55.217
He's tired and just wants to relax, and really doesn't want to talk or think about anything for a little while...

00:55.477 --> 00:56.655
...until he unwinds.

00:57.288 --> 00:59.559
Imagine the wife noticing this and saying,...

01:00.132 --> 01:01.967
..."You must have had a long day at work!"

01:02.643 --> 01:05.439
How about just going into the other room and taking a nap?

01:05.832 --> 01:07.312
I'll run the errands for you.

01:08.039 --> 01:11.379
I might be exaggerating a little here, but my point is this,...

01:11.573 --> 01:16.693
...for a marriage to work, each person should be looking out for the other person before themselves.

01:17.203 --> 01:20.339
If couples did even small things now and again for each other,...

01:20.667 --> 01:23.540
...there would be fewer rocky relationships in this world.
