Since we're at Google, this question is apropos,...

00:03.090 --> 00:08.290
...VEJEONE from Chicago, Illinois asks, "Have you ever Googled yourself just to see what came up? "

00:08.880 --> 00:10.260
Yes, of course I have!

00:11.020 --> 00:12.010
When was the last time?

00:15.620 --> 00:19.890
The last time, probably, well, last night I wanted to know if people knew...

00:20.370 --> 00:24.130
...that I was gonna be here, because everyone was telling me not to Tweet.

00:26.110 --> 00:28.600
So I Googled, and I didn't see enough come up,...

00:28.730 --> 00:30.040
...so I said, "Well, I'm Tweeting."

00:32.680 --> 00:33.700
That solved that problem.

00:34.280 --> 00:34.770
So, there!
