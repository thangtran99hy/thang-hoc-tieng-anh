All musical compositions or performances have a beginning and an end.

00:09.696 --> 00:14.797
But unlike other art forms, the art of music does not conclude with the end of the performance...

00:14.904 --> 00:16.581
...or the listening of a soundtrack.

00:17.256 --> 00:21.769
This is because music has the attribute of both affecting each individual differently,...

00:22.329 --> 00:27.088
...and living on inside the individual like an emotional stamp planted in the mind.

00:28.027 --> 00:30.201
This can occur in one of two ways:...

00:31.055 --> 00:37.023
...either the person will consciously create whatever image or story they feel like as they listen to the music,...

00:37.582 --> 00:42.394
...most probably based on their aspirations or current personal situations.

00:43.139 --> 00:46.441
Or the association may occur at a subconscious level...

00:46.799 --> 00:49.180
...as the individual is performing some task...

00:49.551 --> 00:51.465
...or is immersed in a personal crisis...

00:51.767 --> 00:55.441
...or intense situation when the music is playing in the background.

00:56.624 --> 01:01.176
A musical performance itself might develop into a strong memory as well.

01:01.896 --> 01:04.670
For example, before a concert gets under way,...

01:05.029 --> 01:08.050
...a person might have the chance to meet one of the performers.

01:08.591 --> 01:13.100
Or there might simply be a feeling of nostalgia when the concert is finishing up...

01:13.243 --> 01:18.905
...and the person realizes the great time that he just had with loved ones or good friends at the concert.

01:19.813 --> 01:26.054
Regardless of what kind or how the bond is established between the music and an emotional feeling or memory,...

01:26.624 --> 01:29.665
...it may end up being a strong one that will last a lifetime.

01:30.433 --> 01:33.973
In this aspect, music is unlike any other form of art.
