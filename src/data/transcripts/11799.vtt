If you have pets, you may have wondered whether they know what you're thinking.

00:07.062 --> 00:09.453
Let me share with you what usually happens to me.

00:09.937 --> 00:13.191
My cat hides somewhere when I start planning a trip to the vet.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.998
My dog runs in circles when I think about going out to play.

00:17.670 --> 00:20.740
Both of these events can have logical explanations.

00:21.415 --> 00:24.409
My cat might have heard me pull the carrier off the shelf.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.887
My dog must have seen me glance at his favorite ball.

00:28.579 --> 00:31.407
Well, let me fill you in on an interesting theory.

00:32.022 --> 00:36.192
I work for a pet psychic, also known as an animal communicator,...

00:36.702 --> 00:39.367
...and he would explain these events a little differently.

00:40.060 --> 00:41.968
According to most pet psychics,...

00:42.357 --> 00:46.768
...you communicate with your pets telepathically all the time, without even knowing it.

00:47.491 --> 00:49.933
Your cat hides and your dog gets ready to play...

00:50.233 --> 00:54.256
...because of signals you send with your mind, not because of your actions.

00:55.431 --> 01:01.627
According to pet psychics, electromagnetic energy surrounds and penetrates everything in the universe,...

01:02.158 --> 01:04.279
...much like the "Force" in "Star Wars".

01:05.031 --> 01:07.505
This energy is part of the radio spectrum,...

01:07.940 --> 01:10.565
...but scientists haven't figured out how to detect it.

01:11.504 --> 01:14.419
Pet psychics can use energy to contact animals,...

01:14.869 --> 01:16.969
...no matter how far away the animals are...

01:17.383 --> 01:19.554
...or whether they are still living or not.
