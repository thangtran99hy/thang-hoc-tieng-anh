Paparazzi are one of the most feared by-products of pop culture, wouldn't you agree?

00:07.664 --> 00:15.027
They tirelessly hunt celebrities, public figures and their families for the opportunity to photograph them in candid moments.

00:15.807 --> 00:20.515
At the most basic level, paparazzi hang out on the streets and in public places...

00:20.873 --> 00:23.487
...waiting for an opportunity to photograph a star.

00:24.239 --> 00:28.007
But if you were a member of the paparazzi who wants to make a lot of money,...

00:28.559 --> 00:30.545
...would you wait for hours just to get a picture?

00:31.337 --> 00:33.391
This method is far too inefficient.

00:34.099 --> 00:38.643
Paparazzi must make sure they are in the right place at the right time to get the shot.

00:39.638 --> 00:42.435
Paparazzi work a lot like private detectives. 

00:43.095 --> 00:47.802
Each paparazzo has a network of informers to track celebrity targets.

00:48.575 --> 00:53.389
These informers can be people who work in businesses frequented by celebrities,...

00:53.726 --> 00:56.232
...such as restaurants, shops or salons.

00:56.972 --> 00:59.577
The paparazzi often pay for this information.

01:00.255 --> 01:05.659
In many cases, people who work for the star might be bribed to reveal the whereabouts of their employer.
