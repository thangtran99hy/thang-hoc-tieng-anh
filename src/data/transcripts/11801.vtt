How often and for how long do you spend your time online?

00:06.259 --> 00:10.929
I found among other kinds of addiction, Internet addiction is the hardest to quit.

00:11.443 --> 00:13.045
Many people perhaps agree with me.

00:13.557 --> 00:17.873
I've tried to quit smoking, drinking, and in fact, I did manage to quit.

00:18.478 --> 00:24.030
But I found excessive use of the Internet goes to the point where it disrupts one's life...

00:24.164 --> 00:28.391
...or causes severe stress on family, friends or work environment.

00:29.045 --> 00:30.055
Let's face the reality,...

00:30.454 --> 00:34.036
...how long can you go without the Internet or your personal computer?

00:34.647 --> 00:39.131
Oh, I can't imagine myself spending my day without sitting in front of my laptop.

00:39.688 --> 00:44.769
Like you said, I also think it is one addiction that most people find difficult to quit.

00:45.295 --> 00:49.163
But for most women, I guess shopping would also be difficult to quit.

00:49.616 --> 00:53.115
Well, since there is an escalating number of metrosexuals,...

00:53.551 --> 00:55.568
...men also might agree with my opinion.

00:56.315 --> 01:02.164
Anyways, there even is a word "shopaholic", which means someone who is addicted to shopping.

01:02.961 --> 01:04.881
When I get depressed, I go shopping,...

01:05.011 --> 01:07.716
...and when I'm happy, I also go shopping!

01:08.416 --> 01:12.717
When I get really stressed, I go out and shop, and I feel much better.

01:13.169 --> 01:16.217
It seems like shopping is the hardest addiction for me.

01:16.673 --> 01:22.605
It's tough, but I will seek another activity or hobby to replace those addictions so I can quit.
