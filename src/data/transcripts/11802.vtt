00:02.970 --> 00:06.900
To be or not to be,...

00:08.780 --> 00:09.850
...that is the question.

00:12.760 --> 00:18.610
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune...

00:20.130 --> 00:23.220
...or to take arms against a sea of troubles,...

00:24.520 --> 00:27.940
...and by opposing, end them.

00:31.800 --> 00:36.810
To die, to sleep, no more,...

00:39.160 --> 00:44.480
...and by a sleep to say we end the heartache...

00:45.440 --> 00:48.560
...and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to,...

00:50.870 --> 00:53.130
...'tis a consummation devoutly to be wished.

00:55.290 --> 01:04.670
To die, to sleep, to sleep,...

01:08.750 --> 01:13.660
...perchance to dream. Aye, there's the rub.

01:15.560 --> 01:17.230
For in that sleep of death...

01:18.390 --> 01:24.010
...what dreams may come, when we have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause.

01:25.670 --> 01:30.150
There's the respect that makes calamity of so long life.

01:32.380 --> 01:36.540
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,...

01:38.160 --> 01:42.440
...the oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,...

01:43.970 --> 01:51.760
...the pangs of despised love, the law's delay, the insolence of office...

01:52.520 --> 01:56.930
...and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes,...

01:57.740 --> 02:01.500
...when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin?

02:04.980 --> 02:10.970
Who would these fardels bear, to grunt and sweat under a weary life,...

02:12.500 --> 02:15.020
...but that the dread of something after death,...

02:17.090 --> 02:21.380
...the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns,...

02:23.020 --> 02:29.070
...puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have...

02:30.010 --> 02:32.170
...than fly to others that we know not of?

02:36.100 --> 02:43.010
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,...

02:46.790 --> 02:49.150
...and thus the native hue of resolution...

02:50.650 --> 02:55.720
...is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,...

02:58.110 --> 03:02.940
...and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard...

03:04.390 --> 03:05.790
...their currents turn awry...

03:08.260 --> 03:09.930
...and lose the name of action.

03:23.600 --> 03:30.310
Soft you now! The fair Ophelia! Nymph,...

03:31.850 --> 03:34.820
...in thy orisons. Be all my sins remembered.
