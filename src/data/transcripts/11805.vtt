Do you know anyone around you who has had cosmetic plastic surgery?

00:07.029 --> 00:09.205
I met one of my ex - colleagues the other day,...

00:09.747 --> 00:13.615
...and I couldn't recognize her at first because she had a totally different look.

00:14.291 --> 00:18.185
Tell you what, almost two-thirds of the people I personally know,...

00:18.766 --> 00:22.024
...that's including both men and women, have had plastic surgery.

00:22.357 --> 00:24.037
I'm telling you, two-thirds!

00:24.566 --> 00:27.020
They are not even like models or anything like that...

00:27.598 --> 00:30.280
...they're just ordinary people with normal jobs.

00:30.744 --> 00:32.089
I was actually shocked.

00:32.653 --> 00:37.962
Now, would you have plastic surgery if you had like a free coupon for surgery?

00:38.688 --> 00:39.831
What would you want to fix?

00:40.322 --> 00:42.349
What do you think of undergoing such surgery?

00:42.891 --> 00:47.286
If I had to pick one surgery for myself, I would choose a nose job.

00:47.777 --> 00:52.028
Well, lots of images come to my mind when I think of plastic surgery.

00:52.533 --> 00:58.051
Recent polls say about 58% of teenagers want to have plastic surgery in Korea.

00:58.695 --> 01:02.039
A large number of my friends have had at least one part fixed.

01:02.617 --> 01:04.969
I think plastic surgery is becoming more common,...

01:05.407 --> 01:10.132
...especially in Korea where people do usually pay attention to their appearance.

01:10.713 --> 01:15.824
People, in Korea, commonly think that getting plastic, or cosmetic surgery,...

01:16.268 --> 01:17.854
...makes them feel more confident.

01:18.313 --> 01:21.651
This could be important for situations like a job interview.

01:22.189 --> 01:24.470
So, I'm not totally against it,...

01:25.000 --> 01:28.090
...but what's more important is what you have inside of yourself.

01:28.828 --> 01:32.076
You hear this quite often: "True beauty, is inner beauty."
