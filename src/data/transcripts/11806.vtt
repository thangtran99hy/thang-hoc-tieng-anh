Do you subscribe to a magazine?

00:05.122 --> 00:07.065
What was the last magazine you read?

00:07.857 --> 00:10.983
Well, I always see you carrying around "Time" magazine,...

00:11.407 --> 00:14.328
...and it seems like you are interested in news magazines.

00:14.885 --> 00:16.176
What do you like about them?

00:16.497 --> 00:22.110
I mean no offense here, but most women at your age, tend to read a lot of fashion or food magazines,...

00:22.457 --> 00:24.205
..not magazines on current events.

00:25.229 --> 00:27.235
Well, I'm a long time subscriber.

00:27.683 --> 00:33.179
I have been a subscriber to "Time" for over, let me count the days, 15 years now.

00:33.652 --> 00:36.261
I love reading those opinion - based news articles,...

00:36.613 --> 00:39.187
...and that's why I choose to read "Time" magazine.

00:39.668 --> 00:44.176
These days, you can basically read almost all magazine articles on the Internet,...

00:44.567 --> 00:46.380
...in fact, a variety of articles.

00:46.970 --> 00:51.310
But I like hard copies, because I can keep them for a longer period of time,...

00:51.707 --> 00:53.515
...and I can always refer back to them.

00:54.087 --> 00:55.917
Plus, I do love reading,...

00:56.099 --> 01:01.031
...well I should say, "looking" at those fashion magazines, but I feel like it's a waste of money.

01:01.495 --> 01:05.281
Fashion magazines are always up-to-date and therefore change so quickly.

01:05.867 --> 01:07.854
So, there's no need to buy one, I see.

01:08.519 --> 01:12.565
I used to like reading consumer car magazines or travel magazines,...

01:12.967 --> 01:18.291
...but now I can find more information, pictures from the web, and also other people's comments.
