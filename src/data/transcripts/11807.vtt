00:02.943 --> 00:03.799
I have to rush!

00:04.175 --> 00:08.685
I promised to baby-sit my cousin, since my sister and brother-in-law are both working.

00:09.177 --> 00:11.103
I don't have any problems with baby-sitting,...

00:11.483 --> 00:16.017
...but I think it's better for the kid to spend as much time as possible with her parents.

00:16.538 --> 00:18.424
Let's say, if one of them had to quit,...

00:18.832 --> 00:23.268
...then I guess it's better for my sister to give up her career to look after the child.

00:23.946 --> 00:29.378
Once you become a parent, a child's upbringing is just as important as a successful career.

00:29.713 --> 00:33.098
Wow, you have very set ideas on bringing up children.

00:33.985 --> 00:35.058
Well, here's what I think.

00:35.515 --> 00:38.929
Traditionally, couples have been working for economic reasons.

00:39.353 --> 00:41.741
Today, more and more people, especially women,...

00:42.073 --> 00:45.861
...want to pursue their dreams and happiness by succeeding in their careers.

00:46.511 --> 00:52.210
I think that is one major reason why there's an increasing number of married couples both working to make a living.

00:53.033 --> 00:55.993
But when it comes to child nurturing and doing housework,...

00:56.482 --> 01:01.169
...both husband and wife are responsible and shouldn't place the burden onto the other.

01:01.859 --> 01:04.027
The one who has free time should be in charge.

01:04.705 --> 01:06.051
Also, like what you are doing,...

01:06.371 --> 01:11.604
...other family members could help with doing things like baby-sitting, or cleaning the house.

01:12.117 --> 01:13.807
Hmm... That makes sense.
