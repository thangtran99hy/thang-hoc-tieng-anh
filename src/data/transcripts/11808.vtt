00:02.723 --> 00:07.612
Did you know that Korea has the lowest total fertility rate in the world?

00:08.241 --> 00:10.406
Actually it's not that big of a surprise.

00:10.817 --> 00:13.329
The number of only children is growing rapidly,...

00:13.611 --> 00:18.163
...and even worse, more and more married couples aren't willing to have any children.

00:18.832 --> 00:25.040
I heard the lowest total fertility rate recorded so far was something like 1.17.

00:25.716 --> 00:28.437
Why do you think such a social trend occurs?

00:29.063 --> 00:31.462
I've never thought that as a major concern.

00:32.038 --> 00:36.143
Come to think of it, now I realize that we should take some action.

00:36.639 --> 00:42.354
As things stand, Korea will be losing a significant number of its population per year, don't you think?

00:42.971 --> 00:47.991
Think about it, the number of newly born babies could continue to decline in the future...

00:48.378 --> 00:52.703
...and the population growth will be forecasted to record a negative growth.

00:53.467 --> 00:56.310
I guess it's happening because of the depressed economy,...

00:56.863 --> 01:00.661
...unemployment and couples both having to work for a living.

01:01.157 --> 01:06.036
So the government suggests new plans to encourage Korean women to make more babies,...

01:06.467 --> 01:10.677
...including offering incentives, maternity and paternity support,...

01:11.141 --> 01:14.867
...pension contributions, and other social welfare - related payments.

01:15.486 --> 01:18.848
I hope the new rules imposed deliver positive consequences.

01:19.243 --> 01:19.966
So do I.

01:20.173 --> 01:24.214
I really hope the Korean government can solve this problem effectively.

01:24.863 --> 01:30.083
Again, a low birth rate is a very serious problem not only in Korea but in many countries.

01:30.889 --> 01:35.255
If the Korean government can solve this problem, the future of Korea will be very bright.

01:35.789 --> 01:39.893
I think the human resource is the most crucial factor in our society.

01:40.381 --> 01:43.558
Therefore, we should all try and do something together.
