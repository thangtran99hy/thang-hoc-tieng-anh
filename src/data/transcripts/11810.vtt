Today, I want to extend my best wishes to all who are celebrating Nowruz...

00:06.692 --> 00:08.845
...here in the United States and around the world.

00:09.519 --> 00:12.991
This is a holiday for the Iranian people to spend time with friends and family,...

00:13.552 --> 00:16.111
...to reflect on the extraordinary blessings that you enjoy,...

00:16.613 --> 00:18.815
...and to look forward to the promise of a new day.

00:19.656 --> 00:22.429
After all, this is a season of hope and renewal.

00:23.092 --> 00:25.731
And today, we know that this is also a season of promise...

00:25.851 --> 00:27.806
...across the Middle East and North Africa,...

00:28.311 --> 00:30.467
...even as there are also enormous challenges.

00:30.953 --> 00:33.421
I believe that there are certain values that are universal,...

00:34.155 --> 00:36.495
...the freedom of peaceful assembly and association,...

00:37.239 --> 00:39.763
...the ability to speak your mind and choose your leaders.

00:40.580 --> 00:42.309
And what we are seeing across the region...

00:42.661 --> 00:45.821
...is the insistence on governments that are accountable to the people.

00:46.937 --> 00:51.132
But we also know that these movements for change are not unique to these last few months.

00:51.830 --> 00:54.929
The same forces of hope that swept across Tahrir Square...

00:55.086 --> 00:58.294
...were seen in Azadi Square in June of 2009.

00:59.122 --> 01:01.245
And just as the people of the region have insisted...

01:01.377 --> 01:03.367
...that they have a choice in how they are governed,...

01:03.892 --> 01:06.901
...so do the governments of the region have a choice in their response.

01:07.993 --> 01:11.093
So far, the Iranian government has responded by demonstrating that...

01:11.348 --> 01:13.603
...it cares far more about preserving its own power...

01:13.974 --> 01:16.081
... than respecting the rights of the Iranian people.

01:17.140 --> 01:20.417
These choices do not demonstrate strength, they show fear.

01:21.182 --> 01:24.161
For it's telling when a government is so afraid of its own citizens...

01:24.272 --> 01:25.821
...that it won't even allow them the freedom...

01:25.900 --> 01:28.675
...to access information or to communicate with each other.

01:30.074 --> 01:32.795
But the future of Iran will not be shaped by fear.

01:33.669 --> 01:35.809
The future of Iran belongs to the young people,...

01:36.467 --> 01:38.738
...the youth who will determine their own destiny.

01:39.466 --> 01:40.528
The young people of Iran,...

01:40.980 --> 01:44.392
...carry within you both the ancient greatness of Persian civilization...

01:44.914 --> 01:48.718
...and the power to forge a country that is responsive to your aspirations.

01:49.643 --> 01:52.641
Your talent, your hopes, and your choices...

01:52.759 --> 01:55.921
...will shape the future of Iran and help light the world.

01:56.970 --> 02:00.667
And though times may seem dark, I want you to know that I am with you.

02:01.709 --> 02:04.839
Let this be a season of second youth for all Iranians.

02:05.289 --> 02:08.551
A time in which a new season bears new life once more.

02:09.719 --> 02:12.719
Thank you. And aide shoma mobarak!
