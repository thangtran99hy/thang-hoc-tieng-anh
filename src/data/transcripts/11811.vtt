00:19.124 --> 00:20.005
Do you have one of these?

00:20.680 --> 00:21.840
I got a little obsessed with mine.

00:22.124 --> 00:24.532
In fact, I got a little obsessed with all my stuff.

00:24.992 --> 00:27.003
Have you ever wondered where all this stuff we buy comes from...

00:27.073 --> 00:28.463
...and where it goes when we throw it out?

00:28.951 --> 00:31.966
I couldn't stop wondering about that so I looked it up.

00:32.332 --> 00:35.725
And what the textbook said, is that stuff moves through a system...

00:35.998 --> 00:41.109
...from extraction to production, to distribution, to consumption, to disposal.

00:41.558 --> 00:43.873
Altogether it's called the "materials economy."

00:44.122 --> 00:47.770
For one thing, this system looks like it's fine, no problem.

00:48.111 --> 00:50.905
But the truth is it's a system in crisis.

00:51.292 --> 00:56.261
And the reason it's a system in crisis, is it's a linear system and we live on a finite planet,...

00:56.367 --> 01:00.895
...and you cannot run a linear system on a finite planet indefinitely.

01:01.394 --> 01:05.138
Every step along the way, this system is interacting with the real world...

01:05.385 --> 01:07.954
...in real life it's not happening on a blank white page.

01:08.273 --> 01:11.931
It's interacting with societies, cultures, economies, the environment,...

01:12.241 --> 01:14.885
...and all along the way it's bumping up against limits,...

01:15.292 --> 01:18.383
...limits we don't see here because the diagram is incomplete.

01:19.027 --> 01:21.345
Well, one of the most important things it's missing is people.

01:21.464 --> 01:25.545
Yes, people. People live and work all along this system.

01:26.046 --> 01:30.501
And some people in this system matter a little more than others, some have a little more say.

01:30.868 --> 01:31.521
Who are they?

01:31.943 --> 01:33.415
Well, let's start with the government.

01:33.775 --> 01:36.587
Now my friends tell me I should use a tank to symbolize the government...

01:36.652 --> 01:39.391
...and that's true in many countries and increasingly in our own.

01:39.681 --> 01:43.486
After all, more than 50% of our federal tax money is now going to the military.

01:43.847 --> 01:47.112
But I'm using a person to symbolize the government because I hold true...

01:47.410 --> 01:51.540
...to the vision and values that government should be of the people, by the people, for the people.

01:51.899 --> 01:55.306
It's the government's job to watch out for us; to take care of us.

01:55.522 --> 01:56.672
That's their job.

01:57.157 --> 01:59.090
Then, along came the corporation.

01:59.209 --> 02:01.583
Now the reason the corporation looks bigger than the government...

02:01.652 --> 02:03.633
...is that the corporation is bigger than the government.

02:04.021 --> 02:08.744
Of the 100 largest economies on Earth now, 51 are corporations.

02:09.060 --> 02:11.938
And as the corporation has grown in size and power,...

02:12.251 --> 02:13.867
...we've seen a little change in the government...

02:13.943 --> 02:18.367
...where they're a little more concerned in making sure everything is working out for those guys than for us.
