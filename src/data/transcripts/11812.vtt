She should have died hereafter.

00:07.400 --> 00:09.400
There would have been a time for such a word.

00:10.770 --> 00:21.290
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,...

00:23.290 --> 00:32.460
...creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time,...

00:34.560 --> 00:38.010
...and all our yesterdays have lighted fools...

00:38.790 --> 00:40.610
...the way to dusty death.

00:42.630 --> 00:45.500
Out, out, brief candle!

00:49.610 --> 00:52.880
Life is but a walking shadow,...

00:55.280 --> 00:59.810
...a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage...

01:01.440 --> 01:03.470
...and then is heard no more.

01:05.620 --> 01:10.280
It is a tale told by an idiot,...

01:11.270 --> 01:22.320
...full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
