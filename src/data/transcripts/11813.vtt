00:01.440 --> 00:04.300
In the middle of the tunnel, there was a dead bird.

00:04.700 --> 00:09.850
This made Thumbelina very sad because she loved birds and their music.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.770
She covered the bird with the blanket.

00:13.220 --> 00:15.310
Thumbelina heard its heart beating!

00:15.740 --> 00:17.980
It was still alive but very weak.

00:18.710 --> 00:21.980
She warmed the bird with the torch and gave it grains.

00:22.410 --> 00:25.880
Spring came and Thumbelina took care of the bird.

00:26.480 --> 00:31.350
When the sun warmed the earth, the little hole above the bird grew larger.

00:32.210 --> 00:37.110
"Thank you," said the bird. "I will fly to the warmer places."

00:37.540 --> 00:39.410
"Ride on my back and I will take you!"

00:40.110 --> 00:43.200
She jumped on the bird's back and they flew away.

00:44.170 --> 00:47.380
The bird said, "I will take you to a nice flower."

00:47.760 --> 00:50.870
"There is a small person like you living in every flower."

00:51.470 --> 00:54.350
"They are called 'the spirits of the flowers'."

00:54.810 --> 00:58.260
The bird put her next to the King of the Flowers.

00:59.140 --> 01:02.310
He fell in love with her and gave his crown to her.

01:03.200 --> 01:06.400
"Will you marry me and be my queen?"

01:07.270 --> 01:12.930
Thumbelina was so happy. The flower spirits gave her silver wings.

01:13.480 --> 01:15.750
Now, she could fly to each flower.

01:16.440 --> 01:19.530
She soon married the King of the Flowers.

01:20.020 --> 01:23.390
The bird was happy for Thumbelina, but sad.

01:23.830 --> 01:25.040
He loved her, too.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.690
Later that summer, the bird flew to Denmark.

01:29.100 --> 01:31.800
It sang a song about Thumbelina there.

01:32.370 --> 01:36.050
A writer heard the song. He wrote this story down.
