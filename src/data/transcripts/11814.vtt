We know you're fast as a vampire but how fast are you in multiple choice, then?

00:06.661 --> 00:07.789
Go quickly, one or the other.

00:08.083 --> 00:10.544
Perfect holiday, beach retreat or action - packed?

00:11.653 --> 00:12.255
Beach retreat.

00:12.952 --> 00:15.809
First date, taken to the movies or candlelit dinner for two?

00:16.312 --> 00:16.589
Dinner.

00:17.024 --> 00:19.053
Perfect gift, surprise me or need to know?

00:22.209 --> 00:22.997
What? For you or me?

00:23.654 --> 00:25.173
Well, if you wanna get me a gift, that's fine.

00:25.614 --> 00:26.292
I would just surprise you.

00:26.469 --> 00:27.225
Okay, thanks.

00:28.024 --> 00:30.635
Christmas Eve, are you out with your mates or in with the lady?

00:33.131 --> 00:34.005
Out with my mates.

00:34.307 --> 00:34.808
Good.

00:35.291 --> 00:36.841
US fans or English fans?

00:38.705 --> 00:39.949
Oh, I can't answer that.

00:41.167 --> 00:41.964
I'm fine you didn't.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.765
Twilight or Harry Potter?

00:45.742 --> 00:46.135
Twilight.
