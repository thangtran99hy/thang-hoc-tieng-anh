Prince William of Wales and Kate Middleton are to be married.

00:05.183 --> 00:08.197
When I first met Kate, I knew there was something very special about her...

00:08.500 --> 00:11.953
...and I knew there was possibly something that I wanted to explore that...

00:12.650 --> 00:16.717
...but we ended up being friends for a while and that was a good sort of foundation.

00:17.139 --> 00:19.397
And I'm obviously extremely funny and she loves that...

00:19.605 --> 00:21.381
...so it's pretty good.

00:22.432 --> 00:25.917
We did come to a hockey game at one point when we were at Marlborough...

00:25.995 --> 00:28.048
...and she said, "I'd love to become a princess one day."

00:28.140 --> 00:29.363
"I'd love to marry Prince William."

00:29.899 --> 00:32.294
And obviously after Marlborough, she went to university.

00:32.869 --> 00:35.473
And she said that she met this really nice boy.

00:35.738 --> 00:36.811
She said, "boy."

00:37.615 --> 00:38.515
I said, "Right?"

00:38.865 --> 00:39.599
I said, "What's his name?"

00:39.683 --> 00:42.415
And she said, "Um, Willie."

00:43.575 --> 00:45.967
"Willie? So, all right, he sounds nice."

00:46.245 --> 00:51.379
And she did say that he was absolutely lovely and she said she thinks she might have fallen in love.

00:53.724 --> 00:58.838
I think that they are going to be the most solid royal couple we've had since the Queen and Prince Philip.

00:58.957 --> 01:00.351
I definitely think so.

01:00.435 --> 01:03.409
They are completely in love, dedicated to each other.

01:03.943 --> 01:06.351
They mesh well together, they work well together,...

01:06.439 --> 01:10.450
...and I think they both have the same personalities.
