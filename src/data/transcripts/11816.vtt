00:04.105 --> 00:07.955
Well, it seems like the last couple of elections that we've had,...

00:08.539 --> 00:12.606
...have been almost kind of "turning point" campaigns.

00:13.151 --> 00:14.231
I'm kind of nervous about it.

00:14.587 --> 00:16.593
It's like "It's coming. Here it is:..."

00:16.899 --> 00:18.356
"...2012, the election."

00:18.523 --> 00:23.109
I think it needs to reflect the changes that we've seen in the last two and a half years.

00:23.798 --> 00:26.544
Then, we had an underdog senator.

00:27.154 --> 00:29.572
Nobody thought that he had a chance.

00:30.321 --> 00:31.550
And now he's the President.

00:31.914 --> 00:35.696
I just saw the energy and hope that he had for this country.

00:36.215 --> 00:38.305
Even though I couldn't exactly vote at the time,...

00:38.989 --> 00:42.096
...I knew that someday I'd be able to help reelect him.

00:42.765 --> 00:43.706
And that's what I plan on doing.

00:43.889 --> 00:45.062
We're not leaving it up to chance,...

00:45.169 --> 00:48.617
...we're not leaving it up to "Oh, you know, the incumbent," that type of thing.

00:48.777 --> 00:50.236
It's an election that we have to win.

00:50.664 --> 00:53.561
And unfortunately, President Obama is one person, he cannot go.

00:53.669 --> 00:54.531
Plus he got a job.

00:55.253 --> 00:56.345
We're paying him to do a job...

00:56.437 --> 01:00.217
...so we can't say "Hey, can you just take some time off and come and get us all energized?"

01:00.286 --> 01:01.382
So we'd better figure it out.

01:02.765 --> 01:04.019
I can't not be involved.

01:04.573 --> 01:09.111
There's just too much that is fundamentally important right now that's going on.

01:09.847 --> 01:11.895
As a community, we all have the same concerns.

01:12.001 --> 01:14.011
We all want our kids to go to school and learn,...

01:14.169 --> 01:15.217
...we want them to graduate,...

01:15.280 --> 01:16.935
...we want jobs to be out there,...

01:17.017 --> 01:18.417
...we want people to have homes,...

01:18.511 --> 01:20.578
...we want people to have opportunity.

01:20.917 --> 01:22.664
I don't agree with Obama on everything.

01:23.654 --> 01:25.856
But I respect him and I trust him.
