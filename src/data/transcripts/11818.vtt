These are the faces of black soldiers during the American Civil War.

00:05.699 --> 00:09.311
They're rare photographs of some of the 200,000...

00:09.406 --> 00:12.906
...who fought in the Union army against the southern Confederacy.

00:13.443 --> 00:18.691
The pictures offer slices of life that many Americans may not be aware of.

00:19.060 --> 00:25.297
Stories like that of Adele Logan Alexander's great grandfather, John Robert Bond.

00:25.806 --> 00:29.213
He was born in England in 1846.

00:29.844 --> 00:35.535
When he was 17 years old, hearing about the struggle for Africans' freedom...

00:36.049 --> 00:42.723
...in the United States, the story my mother told me was that he got on a fishing boat...

00:42.877 --> 00:50.123
...and came to Massachusetts because he wanted to help free the slaves.

00:50.487 --> 00:52.876
Adele Alexander is a historian.

00:53.375 --> 00:59.097
She says her great grandfather joined the Union navy and was almost killed in a battle.

00:59.816 --> 01:04.364
It's just one of the many facts Alexander uncovered about her family.

01:04.817 --> 01:09.691
She says her great grandfather sacrificed to help future generations.

01:09.971 --> 01:13.799
Alexander says the Civil War not only freed the slaves,...

01:14.086 --> 01:17.902
...it empowered African Americans to take control of their lives.

01:18.256 --> 01:19.652
But there's a downside.

01:19.975 --> 01:25.598
For example, at least half of African American children were being raised by a single parent,...

01:25.901 --> 01:28.866
...according to the 2005 census data.

01:29.255 --> 01:32.751
And black unemployment is at 15 and a half percent,...

01:33.101 --> 01:35.338
...almost double the national average.

01:35.716 --> 01:42.442
The Civil War itself was a part of the great legacy of slavery in this country...

01:42.973 --> 01:45.868
...and we still live with that every day.
