My name is Tim Lincecum and I'm a world championship baseball player.

00:15.778 --> 00:19.359
I got started with baseball just 'cause I came from a family of baseball players.

00:19.584 --> 00:21.087
I think that's what kinda got me into it.

00:21.510 --> 00:23.711
Coming up, my biggest motivator was fear.

00:24.015 --> 00:26.864
You know, the fear of maybe not living up to expectations or,...

00:27.115 --> 00:30.525
...maybe fear of not being able to play with, you know, guys that are bigger than you.

00:31.396 --> 00:35.433
You know, mentally, I think it's one of those things where you're almost dumbfounded out there...

00:35.577 --> 00:38.597
...you're just kinda going out there with a purpose obviously,...

00:38.691 --> 00:40.921
...I wanna throw strikes and good strikes at that.

00:41.765 --> 00:44.440
When I'm pitching and it's going really well, there is no pain.

00:47.488 --> 00:49.697
Going on obviously there's strenuous points in there.

00:50.131 --> 00:54.275
I think the biggest one for me is when I take my long stride towards home plate...

00:54.809 --> 00:58.174
...and, you know, my lower body is on the target while my upper body isn't...

00:58.625 --> 01:00.433
...the last thing I need to think about is rhythm.

01:00.648 --> 01:04.811
Whether it's the song that I'm coming out to or it's counting in my head.

01:04.985 --> 01:06.746
I try to have that help me with my rhythm.

01:06.999 --> 01:09.913
And if you do things right, the road will take you to the World Series.

01:14.129 --> 01:16.313
I'm Tim Lincecum, a world championship pitcher...

01:16.626 --> 01:20.266
And baseball is for me one of the biggest loves of my life.
