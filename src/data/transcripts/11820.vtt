With this last part in place, the world's largest concrete boom pump...

00:16.339 --> 00:18.951
...is ready for a long journey to Japan.

00:19.503 --> 00:23.953
Made by the German firm, Putzmeister, this pump is normally used to carry concrete...

00:24.365 --> 00:26.222
...in large construction projects.

00:26.736 --> 00:29.353
But in Japan, it will have a very different purpose.

00:29.529 --> 00:33.712
It's gonna be pumping fresh water to the cooling ponds to start.

00:34.478 --> 00:38.939
Putzmeister Manager Gary Schmidt says, smaller pumps have already been spraying water...

00:39.379 --> 00:42.315
...onto the damaged reactors to keep them from overheating.

00:42.811 --> 00:46.301
But a giant pump like this with a 70 - meter vertical reach...

00:46.617 --> 00:52.849
...or 25 stories high, can spray 160,000 liters of water every hour.

00:53.367 --> 00:55.706
It can also do what the other pumps cannot.

00:56.029 --> 00:59.326
It helps to get over any obstructions and in.

00:59.505 --> 01:05.211
So, it will reach up and then back into the building.

01:05.887 --> 01:10.215
Engineering Professor Ivan Catton says, having a bigger pump with a longer reach...

01:10.685 --> 01:13.992
...will be more accurate than existing pumps at the reactors.

01:14.341 --> 01:17.975
Two of these giant pumps from the US will be helping the Japanese government...

01:18.367 --> 01:23.514
...to cool down the reactors at the earthquake and tsunami damaged Fukushima nuclear plant.

01:24.277 --> 01:28.721
In the meantime, Catton says, the best hope for the Fukushima nuclear disaster...

01:29.267 --> 01:31.765
...is to keep pouring water onto the reactors,...

01:32.214 --> 01:36.681
...find and repair the problems, and wait for the situation to improve.
