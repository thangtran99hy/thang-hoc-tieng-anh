Hi everyone. I'm Linda, Community Manager here at Paradox.

00:24.070 --> 00:28.510
And we're here today with Thomas, the Project Lead for our brand new title Sengoku.

00:29.060 --> 00:33.440
He's going to give us some exclusive inside information. So tell us about the game.

00:34.700 --> 00:39.270
The game casts you as a nobleman in medieval Japan,...

00:40.190 --> 00:43.250
...where you compete for power against other noblemen.

00:44.010 --> 00:45.970
OK, and what time period is it?

00:46.910 --> 00:52.860
The game is set in the Sengoku period which was a very turbulent time in Japanese history.

00:55.330 --> 00:59.500
At this time, the Shogun, who was the military ruler of Japan, his power was weakening...

00:59.760 --> 01:02.280
...and that gave room for other ambitious people to...

01:03.970 --> 01:06.020
...carve out their own empires and struggle for power.

01:06.930 --> 01:08.470
Tell us about the goal for this game.

01:08.830 --> 01:12.820
Well, the goal for the game is of course, to become Shogun, the military ruler of Japan.

01:13.030 --> 01:16.660
And you do this by first gaining control of your own clan...

01:16.970 --> 01:20.560
...and then defeating all the other clans in Japan, making yourself Shogun.

01:20.910 --> 01:22.300
OK. Now, an important one.

01:22.930 --> 01:23.970
Will there be ninjas?

01:24.660 --> 01:26.140
Of course, there will be ninjas.

01:27.350 --> 01:31.260
One way, if you have a too powerful opponent who stands in your way,...

01:31.360 --> 01:34.430
...instead of, if you can't meet him on the battlefield, you can hire these...

01:34.820 --> 01:37.630
...stealthy assassins to sort of clear him out of the way.

01:37.970 --> 01:39.940
Excellent. And how do you win the game?

01:40.630 --> 01:43.560
Well, as you know, in lots of Paradox games,...

01:44.020 --> 01:45.760
...there isn't really a clear way to win...

01:45.930 --> 01:49.550
...because all games have always been in sandbox mode.

01:50.360 --> 01:54.990
But in this game, we wanted to make it a bit more focused.

01:55.160 --> 01:57.870
So, the goal here is to become Shogun and...

01:58.330 --> 02:04.820
...as you start to play, you can start to play as a lowly hatamoto or lowly master of a castle.

02:05.700 --> 02:10.720
And then your first step is to increase your power within the clan by supporting a clan.

02:11.270 --> 02:16.450
And then you need to either take power of the clan or create your own clan.

02:16.740 --> 02:19.780
And the next step after that is to defeat all the other clans...

02:20.140 --> 02:23.320
...or most of them anyway, and establish your power over Japan.

02:24.230 --> 02:28.240
OK, thank you very much. And that's all we have for you today. Bye bye.
