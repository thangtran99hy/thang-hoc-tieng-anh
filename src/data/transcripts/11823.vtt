00:00.157 --> 00:04.102
Thousands of tons of radioactive water have entered the Pacific Ocean...

00:04.238 --> 00:07.121
...from the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan.

00:07.613 --> 00:11.376
No one knows how much radioactive air and steam escaped that plant...

00:11.503 --> 00:13.981
...after the March 11th earthquake and tsunami.

00:14.510 --> 00:16.196
So, what is radioactivity?

00:16.277 --> 00:18.445
How does an element become radioactive?

00:18.849 --> 00:20.727
And when does it become a danger to life?

00:21.186 --> 00:23.347
Ralph Anderson, the chief health physicist...

00:23.441 --> 00:26.207
...at the Nuclear Energy Institute in Washington DC,...

00:26.689 --> 00:30.268
...says it all starts with the splitting of atoms or fission.

00:30.617 --> 00:33.585
A split uranium atom releases more neutrons...

00:33.707 --> 00:36.947
...which split more uranium atoms, creating a chain reaction.

00:37.107 --> 00:38.792
This creates a lot of heat.

00:39.009 --> 00:43.892
Rays of energy, like X-rays, are also given off. This energy is radiation.

00:44.179 --> 00:46.093
We're exposed to radiation every day.

00:46.341 --> 00:49.036
The Earth gives off radiation but nothing like the sun,...

00:49.409 --> 00:54.259
...there's a whole spectrum of radiation from the sun including invisible ultraviolet radiation...

00:54.505 --> 00:55.689
...that causes sunburn.

00:56.081 --> 00:58.771
Scientists measure radiation in millirems.

00:59.118 --> 01:02.478
We're exposed to about 300 millirems of radiation a year.

01:02.931 --> 01:08.123
How much is bad for us? Scientists say anything over 10,000 millirems a year.

01:08.571 --> 01:11.999
At the crippled Fukushima plant, there are certain radioactive elements...

01:12.187 --> 01:14.367
...that are of most concern to scientists.

01:14.555 --> 01:18.321
But contaminated water pouring from the plant into the Pacific ocean...

01:18.457 --> 01:22.338
...is reportedly millions of times above levels considered safe.

01:22.588 --> 01:26.074
What the long-term effects of the catastrophe at the Fukushima nuclear plant...

01:26.255 --> 01:29.699
...in Northeastern Japan will be, only time will tell.

01:30.265 --> 01:31.451
I'm Todd Grosshans.
