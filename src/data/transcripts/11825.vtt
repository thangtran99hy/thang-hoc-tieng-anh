00:02.370 --> 00:05.050
There was once an emperor who loved clothes.

00:05.610 --> 00:10.410
One day, a man said to his friend, "We can make some money."

00:10.930 --> 00:13.050
"We can make magic clothes."

00:13.570 --> 00:17.770
"But we don't know how to make magic clothes," his friend said.

00:18.470 --> 00:24.730
"I know. But no one knows that. The emperor doesn't know that. Here is my plan."

00:25.400 --> 00:29.780
"Your plan may work," his friend said. "Let's try."

00:30.790 --> 00:32.780
The two men went to the emperor's room.

00:33.320 --> 00:35.160
He was putting on some new clothes.

00:35.870 --> 00:39.720
"We can make better clothes than those," one of the men said.

00:40.270 --> 00:44.970
"In fact, our clothes are so wonderful that stupid people cannot even see them!"

00:46.010 --> 00:52.060
"I want to be able to tell who the stupid and clever people are in my empire,"...

00:52.500 --> 00:53.400
...the emperor thought.

00:53.760 --> 01:00.480
He told the two men, "Make me some of your clothes. I will give you a lot of money."

01:01.350 --> 01:03.690
The next day, the two men came to the palace.

01:04.520 --> 01:07.890
"Here are your new magic clothes," they said to the emperor.

01:08.530 --> 01:14.050
"Put them on and you will be able to tell the stupid and clever people in your empire."

01:14.970 --> 01:17.210
The emperor called all of his ministers.

01:17.710 --> 01:19.790
He told them to walk with him through the city.

01:20.390 --> 01:23.310
He wanted to show the people his new magic clothes.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.620
Everyone knew about the emperor's magic clothes.

01:26.860 --> 01:30.430
They could not see them, but they did not want others to think they were stupid.

01:31.190 --> 01:33.180
Then, a small boy said to his father,...

01:33.970 --> 01:36.620
..."Dad, the emperor isn't wearing any clothes."

01:37.590 --> 01:41.590
Then, a man standing nearby said, "The boy is right."

01:42.320 --> 01:44.280
Soon, everyone was shouting.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.950
"They are right," he thought.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.830
"I'm not wearing any clothes."

01:50.690 --> 01:53.620
He did not know what to do, so he kept on walking.
