In America, we are going crazy over this, but I wanna know. In the UK,...

00:06.060 --> 00:08.470
...is it as big a deal for everyone?

00:08.870 --> 00:14.060
It's huge, yes. And everyone is looking forward to it, of course, enormously.

00:14.440 --> 00:17.290
And I'm old enough to remember the razzmatazz,...

00:17.690 --> 00:20.660
...when the Prince of Wales married Lady Diana Spencer.

00:21.270 --> 00:22.950
But it's going to be much bigger than that.

00:23.040 --> 00:27.260
If I were to meet the queen when I'm in London for the wedding,...

00:28.150 --> 00:30.590
...how should I greet her? No touching, right?

00:30.750 --> 00:34.800
We Americans like to shake, hug but that's not appropriate.

00:34.870 --> 00:37.340
But you would find if you were to meet the queen,...

00:38.030 --> 00:39.840
...would be that she would put you at your ease.

00:40.130 --> 00:44.520
People think that there's a written protocol and a whole book of rules about this kind of thing.

00:45.080 --> 00:46.120
Actually, there isn't.

00:46.300 --> 00:49.400
Would I curtsy or is that just for the British?

00:49.650 --> 00:51.150
You don't even need to do that.

00:51.390 --> 00:53.270
Ok. Maybe a slight nod?

00:53.660 --> 00:55.840
Absolutely, what you're comfortable with.

00:56.140 --> 01:02.130
So, if we're in the crowd on the parade route and we see the carriage come by...

01:02.480 --> 01:08.320
...carrying the newlyweds, William and Kate, we can whoop and holler or would that be crass?

01:08.630 --> 01:09.030
You know?

01:09.800 --> 01:12.850
If I were you, I'd just go with the flow, go with the flow.

01:13.100 --> 01:16.400
What's the appropriate attire for the wedding?

01:16.760 --> 01:21.110
I think my advice to the girls actually would be: have comfortable feet.

01:22.300 --> 01:23.140
It would be a long day.

01:23.320 --> 01:24.350
It's going to be a long day.

01:24.670 --> 01:27.710
When Lady Gaga met the queen, she wore this...

01:28.240 --> 01:34.720
...ridiculous red latex getup. Is there a protocol about what you should wear to meet the queen?

01:35.020 --> 01:38.950
I have to imagine the queen thought, "What in the world is happening?"

01:39.120 --> 01:41.410
I suspect that the queen was probably prepared for it.

01:41.650 --> 01:46.820
She would absolutely be prepared for people to appear in costume, as it were.

01:47.680 --> 01:48.620
She wouldn't turn a hair.

01:48.870 --> 01:50.450
So, nothing fazes the queen?

01:50.620 --> 01:51.650
No, No.

01:51.920 --> 01:56.050
Dame Barbara, what are your own personal impressions of the queen?

01:56.640 --> 02:00.000
I've been lucky to meet the queen two or three times.

02:00.520 --> 02:04.900
She's always a real pleasure to talk to and to be with.

02:05.060 --> 02:07.990
I did hear there's a particular way to address the queen.

02:08.140 --> 02:08.280
Yeah.

02:09.050 --> 02:12.310
When you first meet the queen and then on second reference.

02:12.530 --> 02:15.070
Yes. When you first meet the queen, you call her, "Your Majesty".

02:15.510 --> 02:16.850
And after that, you call her, "Mum".

02:17.110 --> 02:17.420
Mum?

02:17.660 --> 02:17.790
Yup.
