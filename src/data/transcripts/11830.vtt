00:04.153 --> 00:06.509
Is the Internet a good thing we should embrace,...

00:06.693 --> 00:08.509
...or something we should be wary of?

00:09.091 --> 00:12.599
The way I see it, the Internet is most definitely both.

00:13.320 --> 00:18.627
The Internet enables any computer in the world to communicate with any other computer in the world.

00:19.357 --> 00:23.467
Individuals, companies, and governments are all connected with each other.

00:24.186 --> 00:28.146
With the Internet, it all boils down to the free flow of information.

00:28.655 --> 00:34.972
In other words, individuals from any nation can freely communicate with individuals from any other nation...

00:35.285 --> 00:37.293
...as if there were no national borders.

00:38.089 --> 00:43.541
While this ease of communication and access to information is normally positive in nature,...

00:44.039 --> 00:48.237
...it can be used by people with evil motives to spread falsehoods.

00:48.890 --> 00:54.534
It can be used by criminals to exploit people to gain access to sensitive or personal information...

00:55.006 --> 00:58.256
...such as identity numbers or credit card numbers.

00:59.115 --> 01:01.025
Like anything created by man,...

01:01.418 --> 01:05.973
...the Internet is harmless in nature, and can be used for either good or bad.

01:06.727 --> 01:09.470
So, I think that, as we embrace the Internet,...

01:09.785 --> 01:11.073
...we should do so carefully.
