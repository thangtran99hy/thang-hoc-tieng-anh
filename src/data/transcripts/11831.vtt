Human beings love to laugh,...

00:05.104 --> 00:07.723
...and the average adult laughs 17 times a day.

00:08.293 --> 00:13.201
Humans love to laugh so much that there are actually industries built around laughter.

00:13.654 --> 00:17.953
Jokes, sitcoms and comedians are all designed to get us laughing.

00:18.543 --> 00:20.573
That's because laughing feels good.

00:21.401 --> 00:22.884
For us it seems so natural,...

00:23.259 --> 00:26.899
...but the funny thing is that humans are one of the only species that laughs.

00:27.558 --> 00:33.159
Laughter is actually a complex response that involves many of the same skills used in solving problems.

00:33.931 --> 00:35.179
Laughter is a great thing.

00:35.699 --> 00:38.987
That's why we've all heard the saying, "Laughter is the best medicine."

00:39.708 --> 00:44.346
There is strong evidence that laughter can actually improve health and help fight disease.

00:45.128 --> 00:48.021
It is true that we've long known that the ability to laugh...

00:48.403 --> 00:52.686
...is helpful to those coping with major illness and the stress of life's problems.

00:53.369 --> 00:56.387
But researchers are now saying laughter can do a lot more.

00:56.979 --> 01:00.653
It can basically bring balance to all the components of the immune system,...


01:01.125 --> 01:02.878
...which helps us fight off diseases.
