Why do people act differently when they are around other people,...

00:06.947 --> 00:09.029
...compared to when they are by themselves?

00:09.693 --> 00:13.106
I think it's because of the self-consciousness of the human mind.

00:13.811 --> 00:15.571
People may not even realize it,...

00:16.003 --> 00:19.089
...but they are afraid to show their complete personality,...

00:19.617 --> 00:23.148
...or they just know that something they enjoy won't get them points.

00:23.809 --> 00:27.427
People basically think that they have to change for others' acceptance.

00:28.567 --> 00:32.930
Some people say that the reason why they act differently when they interact with others...

00:33.361 --> 00:36.331
...is because people respond to outside stimulus.

00:37.162 --> 00:40.260
When there is nobody around, we have nothing to react to,...

00:40.807 --> 00:43.906
...except what we sense and what we think and feel inside.

00:44.766 --> 00:48.141
When others are around, we experience stimulus from them,...

00:48.515 --> 00:52.088
...whether it's visual or auditory, and we respond to that.

00:52.989 --> 00:57.254
Other people point out that those who always tried to prove themselves to a parent...

00:57.622 --> 01:00.600
...or tried to be like a sibling or a schoolmate when they are young,...

01:01.056 --> 01:03.396
...tend to grow up still trying to please somebody,..

01:03.729 --> 01:04.966
...no matter who it is.

01:05.731 --> 01:09.511
So, they feel like they have to put on a mask when they are around others,...

01:09.954 --> 01:14.285
...in order for people not to know how insecure they really are about themselves.
