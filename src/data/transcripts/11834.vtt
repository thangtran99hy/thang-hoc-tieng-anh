Well, you see, I received a phone call.

00:05.910 --> 00:10.670
And I was working with about half a dozen other people at the time.

00:11.920 --> 00:15.160
And I couldn't believe what I heard. I was sort of,...

00:15.510 --> 00:19.460
...it was terribly exciting but I just had to carry on working...

00:19.680 --> 00:23.620
...and pretending that everything was normal, when of course I was thinking about,...

00:25.630 --> 00:32.800
...I just was overwhelmed, privileged, excited and daunted all at the same time.

00:33.550 --> 00:35.590
I do know that they love our fruit cake...

00:35.770 --> 00:37.830
...and we are making a traditional fruit cake...

00:38.770 --> 00:41.960
...which is actually how I started the business. So, we know how to do that well.

00:42.510 --> 00:47.970
We have quite a sort of a modern style of cake decorating but it's quite traditional as well,...

00:48.330 --> 00:49.550
...and quite delicate.

00:50.080 --> 00:55.360
And we do make a lot of flowers and I think they just liked our style.

00:56.210 --> 01:03.660
We are making a recipe which is a very traditional recipe...

01:03.950 --> 01:06.090
...and it's just slightly changed for them.

01:06.490 --> 01:09.430
It's just the most exciting cake.

01:12.330 --> 01:16.630
We all do feel very privileged, we're all very excited about making the cake.
