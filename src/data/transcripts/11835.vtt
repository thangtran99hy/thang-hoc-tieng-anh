I think it's gonna be hard.

00:05.375 --> 00:09.879
I think audiences will identify me with that character for a long, long time.

00:10.010 --> 00:14.770
I just gotta go try and convince directors that I can play other roles, be interesting.

00:14.970 --> 00:15.910
Does it worry you slightly?

00:17.920 --> 00:21.660
It would be very naive of me not to be aware that, that might be an issue,...

00:22.950 --> 00:26.650
...but it's not impossible.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.630
My job is to convince them otherwise.

00:29.140 --> 00:30.910
I think there's some confusion.

00:32.310 --> 00:35.300
I think the media don't really understand my decision to go to a university.

00:35.400 --> 00:36.440
I think they think that's a bit odd.

00:36.830 --> 00:38.450
So, they are sort of saying that...

00:38.610 --> 00:40.740
...it means I'm giving up acting, which doesn't at all.

00:40.940 --> 00:44.500
It means, I'm just taking a bit of a break for a couple of years and,...

00:46.630 --> 00:50.420
... you know, I've managed to juggle my film career alongside my school...

00:50.760 --> 00:54.650
...up until this point. So, I just sort of expect that to continue and...

00:59.190 --> 01:01.220
No, I think they got a bit carried away.
