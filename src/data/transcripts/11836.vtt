Excuse me, excuse me. Sorry, do you speak English?

00:10.759 --> 00:11.634
No, I don't. Sorry.

00:12.024 --> 00:14.927
Oh! My car's broken down...

00:15.004 --> 00:17.494
...and I wondered if you could tell me where to find a garage.

00:18.129 --> 00:19.904
Yeah. Well, you know, that's wasted on me.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.459
I don't understand what you're saying.

00:21.649 --> 00:22.937
You don't speak any English at all?

00:23.019 --> 00:24.060
Not a word, no.

00:24.449 --> 00:26.733
It's one of those things where I wish I paid more attention in school but...

00:27.401 --> 00:29.991
Excuse me, excuse me. Sorry, do you speak any English?

00:30.761 --> 00:33.241
English? No. What's the problem?

00:33.423 --> 00:34.623
I don't know. I can't understand her.

00:34.879 --> 00:38.579
Hi, my car's broken down and I need to find a garage.

00:41.229 --> 00:43.814
No, I'm so sorry. I didn't understand that at all.

00:45.734 --> 00:47.543
Alright. Well, thanks.

00:48.487 --> 00:50.979
Tell you what, if you go down that way about half a mile, there's a village.

00:51.487 --> 00:52.789
There might be somebody there that speaks English.

01:04.449 --> 01:05.595
I'm so sorry I couldn't be more help.

01:05.830 --> 01:06.819
Yeah. Sorry about that.

01:07.312 --> 01:07.963
Hey, you never know.

01:08.101 --> 01:10.343
Next time you're over, maybe we'll have learned a bit of English for you.

01:14.039 --> 01:14.727
Thanks anyway.

01:18.565 --> 01:19.539
I can speak English.

01:20.062 --> 01:20.487
So can I.
