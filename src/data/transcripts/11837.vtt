The western part of the world is made up of many different ethnicities and cultures,...

00:09.172 --> 00:12.436
...but as far as manners are concerned, there is one thing in common:...

00:13.096 --> 00:16.390
...it is the custom that is expected of men, to treat women well.

00:16.877 --> 00:19.118
For example, you can easily find men...

00:19.223 --> 00:21.579
...who would help women who carry heavy things,...

00:21.977 --> 00:23.344
...even if they don't know each other.

00:23.839 --> 00:24.730
I learned in school...

00:24.798 --> 00:28.145
...that the treatment of women in a gentlemanly manner like that...

00:28.448 --> 00:30.370
...is based on the concept of chivalry,...

00:30.781 --> 00:32.398
...which originated in Western Europe. 

00:33.212 --> 00:37.214
Right, and another thing is, that men would open doors for women.

00:37.790 --> 00:41.119
I saw a lot of men who would open doors for women at the mall,...

00:41.481 --> 00:42.922
...or as they get in the car.

00:43.547 --> 00:48.378
Oh, and in addition to that, men would give up their seats for women in the subway.

00:48.967 --> 00:52.873
In Korea, we are taught to stand up from our seats for elderly people.

00:53.359 --> 00:57.889
But in the United States, I noticed that men usually do not take empty seats...

00:57.982 --> 00:59.212
...if there are women standing,...

00:59.596 --> 01:01.067
...no matter how old they are.

01:01.773 --> 01:05.449
I like that practice, I guess partly because I am a woman.

01:06.084 --> 01:09.478
It's good to see that women are treated nicely and respectfully.
