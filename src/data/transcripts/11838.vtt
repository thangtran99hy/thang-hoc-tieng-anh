The typical canine companion certainly gives his owner immeasurable happiness.

00:08.399 --> 00:13.599
Not only that, but it's also obvious that the dog lives a life of remarkable leisure.

00:14.271 --> 00:18.881
But some dogs happily perform very demanding jobs for much of their life,...

00:19.435 --> 00:22.240
...putting in a full day's work just like the rest of us.

00:22.884 --> 00:26.946

00:27.637 --> 00:30.272
They provide an invaluable service to humans.

00:30.918 --> 00:35.513
Every day, they help blind or visually impaired people get around more safely.

00:36.108 --> 00:40.641
Furthermore, in most countries, they are allowed anywhere that the public is allowed,...

00:41.150 --> 00:44.745
...so they can help their masters be any place they might want to go.

00:45.425 --> 00:48.210
To do this, a guide dog must know how to:...

00:48.919 --> 00:50.207
...keep on a direct route,...

00:50.576 --> 00:54.861
...ignoring distractions such as smells, other animals and people.

00:55.600 --> 00:59.458
Maintain a steady pace, to the left and just ahead of the master.

01:00.271 --> 01:02.929
Stop at all curbs until told to proceed.

01:03.759 --> 01:07.275
Turn left and right, move forward and stop on command.

01:08.363 --> 01:12.779
Recognize and avoid obstacles that the master won't be able to fit through.

01:13.843 --> 01:17.501
Stop at the bottom and top of stairs until told to proceed.

01:18.553 --> 01:20.747
Bring the master to elevator buttons.

01:21.517 --> 01:23.929
Lie quietly when the master is sitting down.

01:24.927 --> 01:30.780
Help the master to board and move around buses, subways and other forms of public transportation.

01:31.763 --> 01:33.816
Obey a number of verbal commands.
