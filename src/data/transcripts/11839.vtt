When I was an elementary school student,...

00:05.601 --> 00:09.477
...my parents used to take me and my sister to a fast food restaurant.

00:10.096 --> 00:15.603
At that time, if I remember correctly, fast food was still fairly new in Korea.

00:16.328 --> 00:20.234
The hamburger that I had for the first time in my life tasted really good.

00:20.911 --> 00:23.607
It was different from anything that I had eaten before.

00:24.222 --> 00:27.416
But I never knew how bad the food was for my health, either.

00:28.250 --> 00:31.913
Today, fast food is very popular among young children.

00:32.522 --> 00:36.500
Kids eating hamburgers, fried chicken or pizza with their parents...

00:36.745 --> 00:38.646
...remind me of when I was their age.

00:39.397 --> 00:44.183
The difference is, though, that I didn't get to have fast food as often as today's children do.

00:45.004 --> 00:49.043
When I was growing up, having burgers and fries was like a special treat.

00:49.694 --> 00:53.748
Sometimes, I wonder if that would still be the case with the kids these days.

00:54.499 --> 00:58.251
I'm sure, to them, fast food is nothing different from rice and soup,...

00:58.569 --> 01:01.007
...in the sense that they eat fast food so often.

01:01.841 --> 01:06.330
Many people express their concerns that kids in Korea are becoming obese.

01:06.792 --> 01:07.500
No wonder!

01:08.169 --> 01:11.549
The parents need to watch more closely what their children are eating.

01:12.391 --> 01:17.013
It is true that taking them to a fast food restaurant is easier than cooking a meal,...

01:17.609 --> 01:21.095
...but they should know that they are putting their children's health in danger, too.
