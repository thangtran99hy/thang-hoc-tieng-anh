A number of golf courses have recently been built in Korea.

00:06.589 --> 00:11.958
According to the government, more than 100 golf courses will be constructed over the next few years.

00:12.654 --> 00:15.520
Some say that the more golf courses the country has,...

00:15.806 --> 00:17.323
...the better it is for the economy.

00:18.033 --> 00:21.200
Their arguments are that new golf courses will create jobs,...

00:21.605 --> 00:23.720
...and will attract tourists from other countries.

00:24.321 --> 00:28.215
They also point out that building large golf courses could increase foreign investment.

00:29.016 --> 00:32.436
But others say that building golf courses damages the environment.

00:33.352 --> 00:38.027
Also, as far as the benefit of increased employment opportunities is concerned,...

00:38.579 --> 00:42.250
...they say that a new golf course mostly creates part-time jobs,...

00:42.600 --> 00:46.022
...which would not provide long - term job security for the workers.

00:47.036 --> 00:51.500
Many people support the above opinion by saying that building luxurious golf courses...

00:51.875 --> 00:55.163
...widens the already - existing gap between the rich and the poor.

00:55.827 --> 00:59.100
They argue that the country does not need any more golf courses...

00:59.291 --> 01:02.165
...that are constructed at the expense of the natural environment.
