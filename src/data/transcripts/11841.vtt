The word "hysterical" originally comes from the Greek word "hysterikos",...

00:10.470 --> 00:17.470
...which means "of the womb or suffering in the womb," from "hystera" which means "womb."

00:17.880 --> 00:20.670
Back in Ancient Greece, Hippocrates thought...

00:20.900 --> 00:26.050
...that if a woman showed wild swings in emotions, uncontrollable laughter, or weeping,...

00:26.350 --> 00:30.940
...it was caused by her womb or uterus getting loose in her body...

00:31.120 --> 00:33.410
...and causing all kinds of problems.

00:33.660 --> 00:35.820
It would float around in the woman's body...

00:36.000 --> 00:40.330
...and sometimes it would get caught in the woman's throat. Crazy.

00:40.610 --> 00:45.900
Because of the womb theory, that was finally discarded. Only women could be considered hysterical.

00:46.060 --> 00:54.940
Until about 2400 years later, when Sigmund Freud decided that men could be hysterical as well.

00:55.750 --> 00:59.610
And then 1969 came about and the word "hysterical" also meant...

00:59.910 --> 01:05.810
...something so funny that you can't control your laughter, like a hysterical person might.

01:07.590 --> 01:11.680
So that's how the word "hysterical" comes from a woman's womb.
