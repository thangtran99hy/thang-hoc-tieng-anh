Hi, folks! We're here at CTIA 2011. This is my favorite product of the show so far.

00:09.120 --> 00:12.940
This is Dean with "Be A HeadCase" and you've got a great name and you got a really cool product.

00:13.060 --> 00:13.430
What do you got?

00:14.080 --> 00:18.100
We have the bottle opener case that opens bottles, opens cans,...

00:18.380 --> 00:21.170
...stainless steel bottle opener, hard ABS plastic,...

00:21.730 --> 00:24.140
...chamfered edge so you don't scratch it when you put it on the table.

00:24.920 --> 00:29.500
We're the first ones in the world ever to create an app attached to a case.

00:29.890 --> 00:30.820
Let me open the app for you.

00:31.380 --> 00:32.740
So let's open, you're gonna open the app first?

00:33.020 --> 00:37.050
I'm gonna open the beer and I'm gonna open the app. But first, let me show you what the app does.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.810
It counts how many popped tops in cans.

00:40.310 --> 00:42.650
For those guys that open too many, we have a reset button.

00:43.650 --> 00:47.020
We have "choose a song," any song from your iTunes.

00:47.500 --> 00:50.380
We have recorded, any recording, you wanna make a funny sound?

00:50.650 --> 00:53.070
You could put it in there, we have some funny sounds already on there.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.480
We have "choose a picture."

00:54.800 --> 00:59.200
So the accelerometer inside the opener will act inside the iPhone, will actually,...

00:59.500 --> 01:01.720
...trigger the app to open. I'm gonna open a beer for you.

01:01.840 --> 01:02.210
Got a beer.

01:02.810 --> 01:05.430
OK, we're gonna open it. Accelerometer, kick on!

01:07.200 --> 01:11.060
Oh, beaheadcase.com, $19.99.

01:11.230 --> 01:15.040
So, this is great! I mean, you know, the heck with these fancy designs or anything like that, don't you think?

01:15.260 --> 01:18.050
You really need a can opener at the back of your iPhone, right?

01:18.270 --> 01:20.970
That's right. Listen, you could buy a case all day long anywhere,...

01:21.100 --> 01:23.280
...but this is a fun case, it's a real protective case.

01:23.550 --> 01:26.700
This case is one that keeps smiling every time you pop a top.

01:27.280 --> 01:28.690
And now, where could people go get this Dean?

01:28.980 --> 01:30.320
beaheadcase.com.

01:30.540 --> 01:34.470
Alright, so we're gonna, you know, you got your taps set up. We're gonna have a beer and thanks a lot.
