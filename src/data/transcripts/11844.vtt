00:00.500 --> 00:07.250
The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.

00:08.660 --> 00:14.340
Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors...

00:15.410 --> 00:22.590
...so that in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

00:24.090 --> 00:29.500
Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel...

00:30.370 --> 00:34.470
...on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner.

00:35.380 --> 00:37.770
How frequent their misunderstandings.

00:38.280 --> 00:40.290
How eager they are to kill one another.

00:41.020 --> 00:42.900
How fervent their hatreds.

00:44.990 --> 00:49.640
Our posturings, our imagined self-importance,...

00:50.090 --> 00:53.490
...the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe,...

00:54.280 --> 00:57.950
...are challenged by this point of pale light.

00:59.030 --> 01:05.850
Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark.

01:07.200 --> 01:11.470
In our obscurity, in all this vastness,...

01:12.520 --> 01:15.450
...there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere...

01:16.180 --> 01:18.300
...to save us from ourselves.

01:19.290 --> 01:22.700
The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life.

01:23.630 --> 01:26.300
There is nowhere else, at least in the near future,...

01:26.890 --> 01:28.700
...to which our species could migrate.

01:29.500 --> 01:34.280
Visit? Yes. Settle? Not yet.

01:35.660 --> 01:40.580
Like it or not, for the moment, the Earth is where we make our stand.

01:41.990 --> 01:46.730
It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character - building experience.

01:47.890 --> 01:51.500
There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits...

01:52.300 --> 01:55.570
...than this distant image of our tiny world.

01:56.810 --> 02:00.220
To me, it underscores our responsibility...

02:00.410 --> 02:02.350
...to deal more kindly with one another...

02:03.150 --> 02:06.930
...and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot,...

02:07.780 --> 02:10.010
...the only home we've ever known.
