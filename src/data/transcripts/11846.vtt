It goes without saying that celebrities have a huge influence on the general public, especially teenagers.

00:10.460 --> 00:13.325
True, they sometimes have a positive impact.

00:13.746 --> 00:20.462
But more often than not, their glamorous and extravagant lifestyle paints the wrong picture of what life is really all about.

00:21.263 --> 00:25.236
One negative effect of celebrities, as concerned parents put it,...

00:25.657 --> 00:29.218
...is that they are conveying the message, "Being thin is beautiful."

00:30.012 --> 00:33.122
Many Hollywood movie stars boast their skinny bodies,...

00:33.429 --> 00:36.345
...which only helps young teens have a wrong body image.

00:37.103 --> 00:39.505
Many of them would go on extreme diets,...

00:39.840 --> 00:43.477
...thinking that if they are fat, they would not be accepted by society.

00:44.257 --> 00:47.764
But they should realize that rail-thin actresses and supermodels...

00:48.052 --> 00:50.067
...do not represent the whole population.

00:50.865 --> 00:54.563
Fortunately, a recent fashion show held in Madrid, Spain,...

00:54.910 --> 00:59.337
...did just that by not allowing models who are too thin to be walking on the stage.

01:00.356 --> 01:02.578
One of the people who were involved in the show...

01:02.851 --> 01:09.217
...made it quite clear that women and teenage girls should stop starving themselves to become like supermodels,...

01:09.604 --> 01:12.839
...as real women have curves, and curves are beautiful.
