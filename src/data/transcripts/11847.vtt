I like small cars better than big cars.

00:05.903 --> 00:10.519
Smaller cars are easier to maneuver and easier to find parking spots for.

00:11.102 --> 00:15.173
Some people say that small cars do not have enough trunk space, but they do!

00:15.812 --> 00:18.184
I have no problem carrying my groceries.

00:18.739 --> 00:21.407
I think many women would feel the same as I do,...

00:21.859 --> 00:23.703
...but men like big cars, don't they?

00:24.669 --> 00:25.401
Not me!

00:25.867 --> 00:28.771
Actually, I completely support the points you just made.

00:29.323 --> 00:31.298
I have driven a big sedan before.

00:31.802 --> 00:34.133
The car was so long that I couldn't park it anywhere!

00:34.825 --> 00:37.181
Compact cars are definitely the way to go.

00:37.841 --> 00:39.901
Do you know what else is good about small cars?

00:40.555 --> 00:41.767
They get great mileage!

00:42.291 --> 00:45.376
My friend has a huge SUV and he fills it up once a week.

00:45.982 --> 00:48.606
I go to the gas station about once every two weeks.

00:49.201 --> 00:52.171
Driving a smaller car is a great way to save money.
