00:02.110 --> 00:04.136
I feel like I could eat a horse!

00:04.649 --> 00:06.561
I want to eat burgers and fries.

00:07.183 --> 00:09.235
Wait, maybe I should keep a healthy diet.

00:09.675 --> 00:13.909
I can't keep eating junk food because I can see that Americans are getting fat.

00:14.567 --> 00:15.477
Where should I start?

00:15.982 --> 00:18.963
Did you know that Memphis is America's fattest city?

00:19.469 --> 00:20.875
According to some researchers,...

00:20.994 --> 00:26.111
...almost 34 percent of Memphis residents are affected by obesity problems.

00:27.033 --> 00:30.189
Memphis is where my dad is from, so I often go and visit the place.

00:30.840 --> 00:32.698
I didn't notice a difference until now,...

00:33.060 --> 00:36.945
...and I can recall that there are many fast-food restaurants in Memphis.

00:37.805 --> 00:42.981
Anyways, researchers revealed that high rates of poverty is one reason for obesity.

00:43.466 --> 00:44.729
Let me get this straight.

00:45.157 --> 00:46.904
Poverty is what makes them fat?

00:47.299 --> 00:47.941
How come?

00:48.233 --> 00:51.362
Well, people in Memphis value certain types of dishes,...

00:51.687 --> 00:55.517
...most likely foods fried in batter, over healthier choices.

00:56.054 --> 00:58.034
But healthier food is expensive,...

00:58.309 --> 01:02.520
...so that is the most important reason why poor people are getting fatter and fatter.

01:03.303 --> 01:04.071
Back to my point,...

01:04.466 --> 01:08.588
...obesity is becoming a major problem in America as it causes heart disease,...

01:08.869 --> 01:10.655
...and many other kinds of illnesses.

01:11.203 --> 01:17.646
This unhealthy ratio of weight to height is becoming the leading preventable cause of death in America.

01:18.381 --> 01:23.653
I guess it's time for Americans to adopt a good list of healthy diet habits from Asian countries,...

01:24.068 --> 01:25.719
...especially Korea and Japan.
