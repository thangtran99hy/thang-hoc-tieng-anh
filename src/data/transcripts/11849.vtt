What do you think of plastic surgery?

00:05.954 --> 00:08.060
I personally have nothing against it.

00:08.531 --> 00:11.698
It's your body, so you should be able to do whatever you want to it!

00:12.327 --> 00:16.217
I don't understand why people criticize others who get plastic surgery.

00:16.873 --> 00:19.534
If they are against it, then they don't have to do it.

00:20.033 --> 00:22.675
I don't think they should tell other people what to do.

00:23.549 --> 00:24.608
I'll go along with that!

00:25.158 --> 00:29.498
I also think that people should keep quiet about what other people do to their own bodies.

00:30.007 --> 00:31.059
It's none of their business!

00:31.576 --> 00:33.758
An actress even said, "Leave me alone!"

00:34.283 --> 00:35.633
I can't argue with her idea.

00:36.159 --> 00:37.353
It's a matter of privacy.

00:37.673 --> 00:41.013
We have no right to interfere with other people's personal lives.
