00:16.200 --> 00:18.820
As a boy, I loved cars.

00:19.860 --> 00:26.280
When I turned 18, I lost my best friend to a car accident. Like this.

00:27.580 --> 00:33.560
And then I decided I'd dedicate my life to saving one million people every year.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.250
Now I haven't succeeded so this is just a progress report,...

00:37.970 --> 00:40.250
...but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self - driving cars.

00:42.330 --> 00:49.500
Since, our work has focused on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves,...

00:50.390 --> 00:51.660
...any street in California.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.350
We've driven 140,000 miles.

00:55.640 --> 01:02.400
Our cars have sensors by which they magically can see everything around them...

01:03.170 --> 01:06.770
...and make decisions about every aspect of driving.

01:08.170 --> 01:10.300
It's the perfect driving mechanism.

01:11.380 --> 01:14.210
We've driven in cities, like in San Francisco here.

01:15.250 --> 01:18.190
We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1.

01:19.280 --> 01:23.770
We've encountered joggers, busy highways, tollbooths,...

01:24.410 --> 01:27.510
...and this is without a person in the loop, the car just drives itself.

01:27.660 --> 01:32.880
In fact, while we drove 140,000 miles, people didn't even notice.

01:34.790 --> 01:37.810
Mountain roads, day and night,...

01:39.530 --> 01:43.680
...and even crooked Lombard Street in San Francisco.

01:44.900 --> 01:47.210
Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life,...

01:47.700 --> 01:50.190
...but I can do something for all the people who died. Do you know that...

01:51.040 --> 01:54.630
...driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people?

01:56.200 --> 02:00.740
And do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error...

02:01.740 --> 02:06.520
...and not machine error and can therefore be prevented by machines?

02:08.140 --> 02:11.180
Do you realize that we could change the capacity...

02:11.540 --> 02:14.600
...of highways by a factor of two or three...

02:15.480 --> 02:18.490
...if we didn't rely on human precision on staying in the lane...

02:19.360 --> 02:22.530
...but on robotic precision and therefore drive a little bit closer together...

02:23.150 --> 02:27.430
...on a little bit narrower lanes and do away with all traffic jams on highways?

02:30.810 --> 02:39.370
Do you realize that you, TED users, spend an average of 52 minutes per day in traffic...

02:39.670 --> 02:42.650
...wasting your time on your daily commute?

02:44.270 --> 02:50.070
You could regain this time. This is four billion hours wasted in this country alone.

02:51.440 --> 02:54.640
And it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted.

02:55.580 --> 02:58.480
Now I think there's a vision here, a new technology,...

02:58.630 --> 03:00.700
...and I'm really looking forward to a time when...

03:01.150 --> 03:03.900
...generations after us look back at us and say how ridiculous it was...

03:04.360 --> 03:06.230
...that humans were driving cars. Thank you.
