If we define a human being as a being in steady search for meaning,...

00:07.660 --> 00:10.240
...here is the very place where religion comes in.

00:10.380 --> 00:19.140
Inasmuch as man or say, a large essential part of the human population,...

00:20.020 --> 00:22.110
...is going one step beyond that,...

00:22.610 --> 00:30.310
...inasmuch as they strive also for something one might call an ultimate meaning.

00:31.230 --> 00:38.000
And in a religion, man, a religious individual, is not satisfied just with finding a meaning,...

00:38.150 --> 00:40.480
...a meaningful task to complete.

00:40.840 --> 00:44.820
But he goes or she goes a step forward...

00:45.140 --> 00:50.000
...by also including the awareness of a task - giver, as it were.

00:50.910 --> 00:52.200
This is divinity.

00:52.960 --> 00:57.820
So, there is a new dimension they enter. Religious personalities enter...

00:58.210 --> 01:02.500
...by striving for something they may experience...

01:02.640 --> 01:07.390
...and be perceptive of, in terms of an ultimate meaning.

01:07.810 --> 01:09.840
Not just meaning but an ultimate meaning.
