00:00.340 --> 00:02.050
How has being a daddy changed you though?

00:02.290 --> 00:03.450
It's changed everything about me.

00:04.140 --> 00:04.980
Tell me how?

00:05.700 --> 00:09.460
I mean, the simple value of life changes when you have something to live for.

00:10.050 --> 00:12.100
When you have something to look forward to,...

00:12.340 --> 00:12.540
Ok.

00:12.740 --> 00:14.380
...you know, your standard of living changes....

00:14.820 --> 00:19.850
...to understand love in a way that is unconditional.

00:20.570 --> 00:25.680
You know, to be able to look at something so passionately and give all of yourself to make sure that...

00:25.830 --> 00:29.360
...it is protected, it is the greatest that it can be,...

00:30.290 --> 00:31.970
...not sheltered but protected.

00:33.090 --> 00:34.590
It's something that I've never felt before.

00:34.820 --> 00:35.010
Right.

00:35.870 --> 00:39.150
You know, I'd say, I felt some of that maybe in marriage but for the most part,...

00:39.350 --> 00:43.110
...the one thing that is irreplaceable and unconditional...

00:43.950 --> 00:46.250
...is that love and passion that I have for my children.

00:46.440 --> 00:46.790
Got you.

00:47.250 --> 00:47.720
My boys.

00:47.930 --> 00:49.790
Yes, you mentioned your marriage, we won't talk about it long.

00:50.240 --> 00:52.780
But, you know, we all know that you decided to part ways.

00:52.920 --> 00:53.050
Yeah.

00:53.270 --> 00:54.860
You guys are still raising your family together?

00:55.210 --> 00:55.300
Yeah.

00:56.810 --> 01:00.680
Do you see yourself ever becoming a married man again in the industry?

01:01.480 --> 01:02.530
You mean in the industry?

01:02.700 --> 01:05.380
Well, Usher Raymond, do you see yourself getting married again?

01:06.750 --> 01:08.990
I mean, I can't say never, forever.

01:09.240 --> 01:09.390
Right.

01:09.690 --> 01:11.980
But right now, that's not really my focus.

01:14.240 --> 01:19.840
You know, one thing I will say is that having been married...

01:20.620 --> 01:23.210
...and have such an incredible moment happen in my life,...

01:24.080 --> 01:29.270
...I'd never demean what that is and how incredible that moment is, or would be.

01:29.570 --> 01:31.950
You know, to be able to have it with the right person is important.

01:32.140 --> 01:32.320
Right.

01:32.730 --> 01:34.530
Unfortunately, we didn't work out in that way.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.700
But as I said, never to demean what it meant to me and how genuine of the moment.

01:38.880 --> 01:39.550
It was genuine.

01:40.570 --> 01:42.770
One of the most genuine moments of my life, definitely.

01:43.010 --> 01:43.480
Definitely.
