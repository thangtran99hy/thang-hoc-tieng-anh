00:01.880 --> 00:04.030
I've played against every one of these guys.

00:05.690 --> 00:06.940
I checked him into the boards.

00:08.550 --> 00:09.600
Got checked by him.

00:11.080 --> 00:12.130
I made him bleed.

00:13.530 --> 00:15.910
I've competed against them my whole life.

00:17.160 --> 00:18.430
Measured myself against him,...

00:19.170 --> 00:19.700
...and him,...

00:20.100 --> 00:20.580
...and him.

00:21.670 --> 00:23.350
Pushed myself to get here.

00:25.680 --> 00:26.580
To stand next to them.
