Alex, since you've been spending quite some time in Korea,...

00:05.735 --> 00:07.120
...do you know who this group is?

00:07.549 --> 00:09.325
They are a group of singers, in fact,...

00:09.694 --> 00:13.349
...there are 13 members and they are also one of my favorites.

00:13.479 --> 00:14.329
Are you kidding me?

00:14.447 --> 00:15.772
That's Super Junior!

00:16.324 --> 00:18.641
In Korea people call them "idol star", right?

00:19.285 --> 00:22.834
Well, when they refer to "idol", I guess they mean child stars.

00:23.483 --> 00:27.612
Well, I don't know about kids or teenagers becoming a celebrity at such a young age.

00:28.198 --> 00:33.879
If I had a child, and he or she wanted to jump into that field, I would dissuade him or her.

00:34.358 --> 00:38.385
I swear to God, there would be more things that a kid would lose than gain.

00:39.015 --> 00:43.609
Children at their age, they need to play with their friends and family, at school or wherever,...

00:44.069 --> 00:46.130
...and sometimes study as hard as they can.

00:46.431 --> 00:47.947
You know, have a normal life.

00:48.602 --> 00:54.032
I think that being so different from others, especially at such a young age doesn't seem so good.

00:54.674 --> 00:56.534
I have to partially agree with you there;...

00:56.933 --> 01:01.692
...becoming a star, or celebrity at a young age could leave a person with a lonely life,...

01:02.135 --> 01:03.639
...but not necessarily.

01:04.099 --> 01:09.489
He or she could enjoy their lives to the fullest doing what they enjoy and what they are also good at!

01:10.105 --> 01:16.321
That being said, there are some role models who started their careers at young ages and went on to be successful.
