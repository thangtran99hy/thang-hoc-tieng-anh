Mi-na, every April 5th is what is known as the so-called "Day of Trees" in Korea, right?

00:08.895 --> 00:12.316
It's a day to think about reforestation and tree - planting...

00:12.764 --> 00:16.662
...and it seems like Korean people do have a lot of interest in planting trees.

00:17.102 --> 00:18.909
Is there a particular reason for that?

00:19.423 --> 00:20.813
Have you planted a tree before?

00:21.327 --> 00:22.395
I have, in fact!

00:22.895 --> 00:26.725
When I was little I used to climb a mountain with my dad and plant a tree.
