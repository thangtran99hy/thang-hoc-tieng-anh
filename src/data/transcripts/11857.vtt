Happy birthday Mi-na!

00:04.139 --> 00:05.401
You are now a year older!

00:05.717 --> 00:07.127
What's your birthday wish?

00:07.401 --> 00:08.501
Thank you, Alex.

00:08.961 --> 00:11.865
My birthday wish is to get a job promotion this year.

00:12.350 --> 00:16.033
Well, thank you so much for remembering my birthday and celebrating it.

00:16.409 --> 00:17.455
That's very nice of you. 

00:17.801 --> 00:19.833
Don't mention it, that's what friends are for!

00:20.425 --> 00:24.145
Did you have, what was it called, brown seaweed soup this morning?

00:24.528 --> 00:26.807
I heard Koreans eat it on their birthdays.

00:27.365 --> 00:31.842
Yes, because a woman who delivers a child needs to take lots of iron,...

00:32.229 --> 00:35.281
...and brown seaweed or other seaweeds are rich in iron.

00:35.766 --> 00:39.859
So that's why you eat brown seaweed soup on your birthday to commemorate birth.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.894
Anyhow, how did you spend your last birthday?

00:43.227 --> 00:46.130
It's such a shame that we don't have a culture like yours.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.001
Oh well, back to your question.

00:48.324 --> 00:51.407
My last birthday was absolutely crazy.

00:51.765 --> 00:53.735
Guess what I got for a birthday present?

00:54.296 --> 00:56.096
I got a car from my parents.

00:56.495 --> 00:58.461
It was not a new car; it was used,...

00:58.595 --> 01:03.765
...but the thing is, I didn't expect that my parents would spend that much money for my birthday.

01:04.546 --> 01:08.528
Well, now, my brother is using it, so it became more like a family car,...

01:08.917 --> 01:11.682
...but that was the best birthday gift ever!

01:12.085 --> 01:13.559
That sounds very nice.

01:14.029 --> 01:15.995
I wish my parents would do the same,...

01:16.423 --> 01:19.720
...but for this year's birthday, I got a nice pair of shoes,...

01:20.069 --> 01:21.651
...and I am very happy with them!
