What are some things that you have never done in your entire life?

00:06.131 --> 00:08.367
For example, I'll tell you what mine is.

00:08.774 --> 00:11.726
My family motto is "Don't lie, be honest",...

00:12.103 --> 00:15.599
...so, all my life I have tried not to lie in any case.

00:15.900 --> 00:17.682
What's a family motto?

00:18.002 --> 00:21.223
I've heard about a company motto, or a program motto,...

00:21.617 --> 00:23.182
...but never about a "family motto".

00:23.595 --> 00:25.743
Is that something like precepts?

00:26.389 --> 00:29.519
Yes, what could be the best way to say this?

00:30.035 --> 00:34.233
It provides family members with the guidelines and precepts for behavior.

00:34.749 --> 00:38.679
You know, Korean families regard a family bond as very important.

00:39.233 --> 00:43.291
We all think what we do and how we behave represents the whole family,...

00:43.642 --> 00:46.353
...so it is very important to set a rule or motto...

00:46.724 --> 00:50.774
...and keep the behavior to remind family members to behave accordingly.

00:51.282 --> 00:54.574
Some families have their mottos passed down from their ancestors,...

00:55.055 --> 00:56.449
...and some make up their own.

00:57.089 --> 01:00.641
Is there such a thing in your country, or any other western society?

01:01.520 --> 01:05.557
Like you said, I think mottos are related to a collective society.

01:06.029 --> 01:10.843
Most western countries including where I am from, focus on individual behavior.

01:11.351 --> 01:14.027
In other words, a person stands out for himself.

01:14.489 --> 01:17.911
Others don't link him or her with their other family members.

01:18.701 --> 01:20.928
But if I were to have a family motto,...

01:21.341 --> 01:25.445
...I would choose something like "Do your best or try your hardest."
