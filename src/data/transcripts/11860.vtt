00:00.045 --> 00:01.279
Now if you'd have asked me that a year ago,...

00:01.345 --> 00:03.096
...I wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty.

00:03.787 --> 00:05.600
But in the new project that I'm working on, my new film,...

00:05.688 --> 00:07.848
...we examine the world of marketing, advertising.

00:09.261 --> 00:13.027
And as I said earlier, I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years,...

00:13.653 --> 00:15.134
...but nothing could prepare me,...

00:15.890 --> 00:18.780
...nothing could ready me for anything as difficult...

00:19.580 --> 00:24.596
...or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys.

00:28.557 --> 00:32.957
Over the course of this film, we had 500 - plus companies...

00:33.500 --> 00:34.670
...who were up and down companies saying,...

00:34.770 --> 00:36.175
..."no," they didn't want any part of this project.

00:36.289 --> 00:39.282
They wanted nothing to do with this film mainly because they had no control.

00:39.473 --> 00:43.003
They would have no control over the final product. But we did get 17 brand partners...

00:43.638 --> 00:45.391
...who were willing to relinquish that control,...

00:45.499 --> 00:48.696
...who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself,...

00:50.314 --> 00:52.777
...and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories...

00:52.867 --> 00:54.438
...that normally we wouldn't be able to tell,...

00:55.058 --> 00:57.663
...stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind.

00:58.481 --> 01:00.644
They enabled us to tell the story about neuro - marketing...

01:00.819 --> 01:02.773
...as we got into telling the story in this film...

01:02.995 --> 01:05.233
...about how now they're using MRI's to target...

01:05.561 --> 01:09.854
...the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing.

01:10.648 --> 01:13.237
We went to Sao Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising.

01:13.317 --> 01:14.937
In the entire city for the past five years,...

01:15.005 --> 01:17.777
...there's no billboards, there's no posters, there's no fliers, nothing.

01:19.803 --> 01:21.285
And we went to school districts...

01:21.571 --> 01:25.876
...where now companies are making their way into cash-strapped schools all across America.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.356
And how has that been for them? Has it been successful?

01:29.817 --> 01:32.489
Well since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, let's just take a look.

01:32.928 --> 01:35.645
According to Burrelles, the movie premiered in January,...

01:35.708 --> 01:37.521
...and since then, this isn't even the whole thing,...

01:37.597 --> 01:40.430
...we've had 900 million media impressions for this film.

01:41.125 --> 01:44.421
What I always believe is that, if you take chances, if you take risks,...

01:44.781 --> 01:46.663
...that in those risks will come opportunity.

01:47.160 --> 01:49.167
I believe that when you push people away from that,...

01:49.436 --> 01:51.037
...you're pushing them more towards failure.

01:51.914 --> 01:54.745
I believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse,...

01:54.884 --> 01:58.131
...then you're preparing your whole company to be reward challenged.

01:58.991 --> 02:03.442
I feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks.

02:03.883 --> 02:07.221
We need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them.

02:07.745 --> 02:10.563
Ultimately, moving forward, I think we have to embrace fear.

02:11.213 --> 02:12.823
We've got to put that bear in a cage.

02:20.523 --> 02:22.431
Embrace fear. Embrace risk.
