Harry Potter,...

00:24.300 --> 00:26.080
...you have fought valiantly.

00:28.730 --> 00:33.340
But you have allowed your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself.

00:39.620 --> 00:40.580
On this night,...

00:43.790 --> 00:44.450
...join me...

00:47.370 --> 00:48.820
...and confront your fate.

00:52.870 --> 00:53.380
Come on!

00:54.360 --> 00:55.050
We can end this.

00:58.480 --> 01:00.530
I never wanted any of you to die for me.

01:08.210 --> 01:10.760
Come on, Tom. Let's finish this the way we started it.

01:11.750 --> 01:12.160
Together.

01:17.330 --> 01:17.960
Run!

01:29.190 --> 01:31.740
Only I can live forever.
