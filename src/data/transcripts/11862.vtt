The global economy today friends is like a monster truck with the gas pedal stuck...

00:06.380 --> 00:08.070
...and we have lost the key.

00:10.390 --> 00:17.380
And the only way we're gonna catch that truck is with a disruptive breakthrough.

00:18.690 --> 00:24.280
And the only way we're gonna get a disruptive breakthrough is with a completely different mix...

00:25.150 --> 00:28.920
...of standards, regulations, incentive, and taxes...

00:29.570 --> 00:31.490
...that will trigger that disruption,...

00:32.580 --> 00:37.750
...which is why my fundamental rule is change your leaders, not your light bulbs.

00:38.620 --> 00:41.310
Oh, it's great to change your light bulbs,...

00:41.620 --> 00:49.430
...but if you don't change your leaders, if you don't change the leaders who write the rules,...

00:49.830 --> 00:54.860
...who trigger the innovation, we are cooked.

00:56.590 --> 00:59.390
So what I've been trying to do in the new book I'm writing...

01:01.330 --> 01:07.040
..is basically, in my own little way is to try to reshape how we think about this problem...

01:08.190 --> 01:12.460
...because we actually think we're having a revolution and we're actually having a party.

01:13.950 --> 01:17.790
But one of the real problems in getting people to rethink this problem...

01:18.980 --> 01:22.110
...is getting them to rethink the meaning of green.

01:23.340 --> 01:27.780
One of the big problems around green is that, I'm a big believer to name something is to own it.

01:28.220 --> 01:30.060
If you can name an issue, you can own an issue.

01:30.810 --> 01:31.500
The world is flat.

01:33.600 --> 01:37.980
And the problem with green all these years is it was named by its opponents.

01:38.770 --> 01:44.410
Basically, they named it liberal, tree - hugging, sissy, girlie man,...

01:44.780 --> 01:52.590
...unpatriotic, vaguely French, just vaguely French, something about it vaguely French okay?

01:54.520 --> 01:58.100
Well, what I'm really out to do is to rename green.

01:59.050 --> 02:07.480
We name it geo - political, geo - strategic, economic, capitalistic, entrepreneurial, patriotic.

02:07.830 --> 02:12.200
Green is the new red, white, and blue. Thank you very much.
