00:01.240 --> 00:06.450
"Tink, where are you?" Peter called quietly. "Did you find my shadow?"

00:06.970 --> 00:10.670
The sound of golden bells answered him. It is the fairy language.

00:11.410 --> 00:15.030
Peter quickly pulled his shadow from the drawer, but it would not stick back on!

00:15.630 --> 00:18.460
He began to cry. His crying woke Wendy.

00:19.490 --> 00:21.310
"Boy, why are you crying?"

00:22.100 --> 00:24.640
Peter bowed to her, as the fairies had taught him.

00:25.310 --> 00:26.910
"What's your name?" he asked.

00:27.780 --> 00:30.610
"Wendy Moira Angela Darling," she replied.

00:31.060 --> 00:31.770
"What is your name?"

00:32.430 --> 00:33.070
"Peter Pan."

00:33.770 --> 00:34.540
"Where do you live?"

00:35.320 --> 00:38.710
"Second to the right," said Peter, "and then straight on till morning."

00:39.610 --> 00:40.770
"What a funny address!"

00:41.540 --> 00:42.910
"No, it isn't," he said.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.180
"Is that what they put on the letters?"

00:46.050 --> 00:48.340
"Don't get any letters," he said.

00:49.190 --> 00:50.490
"But your mother gets letters?"

00:51.160 --> 00:53.020
"Don't have a mother," he said.

00:53.670 --> 00:56.790
"Oh Peter, no wonder you were crying," she said.

00:57.570 --> 01:00.700
"I was crying because I can't get my shadow to stick back on."

01:01.670 --> 01:02.530
"It has come off?"

01:03.260 --> 01:03.810
"Yes."

01:04.540 --> 01:07.980
"Then it must be sewn on," she said. "I'll sew it on for you."

01:09.000 --> 01:13.130
She sewed the shadow onto his foot, and soon he was jumping around happily.
