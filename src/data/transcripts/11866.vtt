Mi-na! Let's have a hangover brunch. 

00:05.273 --> 00:07.886
I thought I had sobered up, but now I feel sick. 

00:08.445 --> 00:11.939
Man! I kept drinking and drinking last night... 

00:12.089 --> 00:14.949
...and I couldn't resist people from filling my glass. 

00:15.483 --> 00:18.357
One of my colleagues told me that it's rude to say no...

00:18.469 --> 00:21.206
...when a person in a higher position offers you a drink.

00:21.792 --> 00:22.732
What can I say? 

00:23.066 --> 00:28.249
I'm in an entry level position and almost all of them there are in a higher position. 

00:29.035 --> 00:34.589
Well, I'd say drinking is fun and I enjoy spending time with people from work,...

00:35.031 --> 00:37.519
...but last night was just too much.

00:37.963 --> 00:42.433
I can totally picture you sitting there with an awkward smile on your face.

00:42.742 --> 00:43.783
Poor Alex.

00:44.346 --> 00:48.878
Believe it or not, you can see how Korean people love drinking alcohol.

00:49.385 --> 00:53.484
In fact, all of the people that I know drink like fish.

00:54.050 --> 00:59.418
Well, there's one significant difference between when you have a drink with your normal friends...

00:59.589 --> 01:02.882
...and occasions when you have a drink with somebody like your boss.

01:03.444 --> 01:07.543
When your boss offers you a glass of soju, you can't just take a sip,...

01:07.987 --> 01:10.038
...but you must empty the glass.

01:10.407 --> 01:15.367
Then you should return the empty glass to him to have it filled once again with more soju.

01:15.720 --> 01:18.425
Eww, that doesn't sound very hygienic,...

01:19.053 --> 01:22.533
...but the sharing is what bonds people together I guess,...

01:23.060 --> 01:25.419
...but recent scientific research has revealed...

01:25.508 --> 01:29.297
...that this could lead to the spreading of germs and even viruses!
