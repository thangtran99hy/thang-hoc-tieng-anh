Last night, I was trying to find my brother whose cell phone was dead. 

00:06.014 --> 00:08.071
I wish I had a cell phone tracking system. 

00:08.431 --> 00:10.579
What is it called, GPS!

00:11.081 --> 00:13.279
This stands for Global Positioning System. 

00:13.885 --> 00:17.992
But at the same time, I don't want other people to keep track of my location. 

00:18.461 --> 00:20.212
That's totally against privacy,... 

00:20.379 --> 00:22.213
...you know, a fundamental human right. 

00:22.605 --> 00:24.007
I can't agree with you more.

00:24.423 --> 00:26.379
But if you put it the other way around,...

00:26.763 --> 00:29.054
...the system can be extremely useful.

00:29.450 --> 00:32.005
For instance, when trying to catch a criminal,...

00:32.329 --> 00:34.904
...the system can be very helpful, don't you think?

00:35.491 --> 00:37.945
I'm not too sure how actively it is used today,...

00:38.345 --> 00:44.231
...but we can witness in many movies that the usage of tracking phone systems doesn't appear to be so bad.

00:44.906 --> 00:50.754
I guess the best way would be that there should be a law to enforce limiting any usage for private reasons.

00:51.013 --> 00:51.736
Absolutely. 

00:52.213 --> 00:55.671
Like you said, tracking phones could work as a crucial measure,... 

00:55.786 --> 00:58.225
...only if used for a criminal investigation. 

00:58.793 --> 01:01.284
Otherwise, if the system is widely supplied,... 

01:01.587 --> 01:03.245
...the result could be total chaos. 

01:03.697 --> 01:05.508
People can't lie about their location,...
