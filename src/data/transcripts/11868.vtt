Mi-na, you said your sister is a vegetarian, right? 

00:06.031 --> 00:08.858
Did she start being a vegetarian when she was born? 

00:09.291 --> 00:12.160
Or did she at some point later on decide to become one? 

00:12.704 --> 00:18.759
One of my close friends once tried to become a vegetarian after he saw images of slaughter, but failed. 

00:19.243 --> 00:21.168
He said that it was a really tough challenge. 

00:21.630 --> 00:26.497
Like myself, a meat - lover, I can't imagine myself eating vegetables only.

00:27.267 --> 00:29.065
I don't think it's good for your health either.

00:29.527 --> 00:31.867
You should get nutrition from all sorts of food;...

00:32.240 --> 00:35.335
...meat, fruits, and vegetables to have a healthy diet.

00:36.131 --> 00:39.456
People choose vegetarianism for a variety of reasons.

00:39.877 --> 00:42.913
Different people follow different forms of vegetarianism...

00:43.323 --> 00:48.051
..but a true vegetarian eats no meat at all, including chicken and fish.

00:48.656 --> 00:52.428
One thing I know is that when a woman decides to become a vegetarian,...

00:52.879 --> 00:56.171
...that might mean she wants to lose some weight, like my sister.

00:56.648 --> 00:59.891
You know, instead of not eating anything for several days,...

01:00.259 --> 01:03.651
...she would rather eat something that doesn't contain any fat or sugar.

01:04.505 --> 01:11.486
But like you said, being a vegan means you are not eating enough carbohydrates, protein and of course fat.

01:11.892 --> 01:14.469
So, I also think that it's not good for your health.

01:15.051 --> 01:21.081
What you should do instead of adjusting your diet instantly is exercise on a regular basis.

01:21.525 --> 01:23.593
This is a good way to keep your body healthy.
