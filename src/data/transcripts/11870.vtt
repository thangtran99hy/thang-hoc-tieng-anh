Mi-na, here's what I have for you.

00:05.350 --> 00:10.455
Take a close look at these profiles and tell me which guy is the best man for you.

00:10.973 --> 00:14.775
I have a good-looking guy, a wealthy one, a smart one,...

00:15.170 --> 00:17.911
...and of course other guys with various careers.

00:18.429 --> 00:21.413
What's the most important component you look for?

00:22.050 --> 00:25.979
Well, appearance is obviously the first thing I see,...

00:26.387 --> 00:28.001
...so the way he looks, maybe.

00:28.519 --> 00:32.989
Then if I have a chance to talk to him, I will observe the way he speaks...

00:33.478 --> 00:36.955
...or the things he says, along with the vocabulary he uses.

00:37.674 --> 00:39.307
When people talk about their lives,...

00:39.731 --> 00:42.000
...I find that it is easy to know about them...

00:42.095 --> 00:45.059
...and to find clues about who they are as a person.

00:45.708 --> 00:50.155
Back to where I was, next, I will find out what he does for a living.

00:50.599 --> 00:56.007
When it comes to careers, I don't value jobs like lawyers, doctors and professors.

00:56.454 --> 00:59.862
I want to know if he enjoys what he does and if he is good at it.

01:00.477 --> 01:01.436
This is what I value.

01:01.815 --> 01:04.458
It may sound easy, but finding such a path...

01:04.570 --> 01:06.954
...is what I consider the most important thing.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.530
Then, I would check on his relationships...

01:09.639 --> 01:13.251
...with his family members, siblings, friends and other people around him.

01:13.705 --> 01:14.817
What about you Alex?

01:15.332 --> 01:18.163
Are you more like a "love at first sight" kind of guy?

01:18.528 --> 01:22.754
I have to admit that I am somewhat a "love at first sight" kind of guy.

01:23.369 --> 01:27.284
I think what I really look for is how much she is willing to devote herself...

01:27.730 --> 01:31.597
...to our family, kids and their education and careers.
