I just came back from Jeju Island, and wow,...

00:05.347 --> 00:07.020
...is that place amazing or what!

00:07.640 --> 00:12.759
But, can I ask you a quick question on why more Korean people tend to travel overseas...

00:13.154 --> 00:18.744
...when they can simply fly to Jeju Island or anywhere within Korea to enjoy a nice vacation?

00:19.323 --> 00:22.585
I think it's because most of them want to experience cultural...

00:22.691 --> 00:25.456
...and atmospheric differences outside of Korea.

00:26.037 --> 00:28.157
I personally prefer to travel abroad,...

00:28.585 --> 00:31.589
...but not like places that are far away from Korea.

00:32.047 --> 00:37.034
I like traveling to neighboring countries like China, Thailand, Japan or Hong Kong.

00:37.654 --> 00:42.707
Even in Japan, you will experience a huge difference in culture compared to Korea.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.821
Since it doesn't cost that much,...

00:45.261 --> 00:48.021
...I go to those other Asian countries twice a year...

00:48.469 --> 00:50.111
...during the summer and winter.

00:50.671 --> 00:52.236
Let's hear what you have on your mind.

00:52.548 --> 00:53.833
I love traveling.

00:54.049 --> 00:59.273
In fact, I don't mind traveling nationally or internationally as long as I can afford it.

00:59.933 --> 01:03.134
Well, in fact, after traveling to some European countries,...

01:03.517 --> 01:07.708
...I would say that traveling in Europe is the best, again, if I can afford it.

01:08.231 --> 01:10.187
Europe? How nice!

01:10.568 --> 01:12.374
I've never been to Europe before.

01:12.919 --> 01:18.237
I just saw the beautiful pictures of European countries like France, Italy and Spain.

01:18.909 --> 01:22.291
I see a lot of Koreans also go to Europe for their vacation.

01:22.786 --> 01:26.209
Okay, I'm going to take a trip to Europe this summer...

01:26.285 --> 01:29.061
...after I've earned some money in a part-time job.
