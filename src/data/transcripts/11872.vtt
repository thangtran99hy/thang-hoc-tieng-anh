00:02.404 --> 00:04.569
I can't wait until my car gets fixed!

00:05.163 --> 00:07.687
Didn't you say it's convenient to take the subway to work?

00:08.058 --> 00:10.691
With all due respect, Oyon, I beg to differ.

00:11.046 --> 00:14.189
First of all, it takes 2 hours for me to get to work!

00:14.732 --> 00:19.872
That's 4 hours of my precious time going down the drain, every morning and evening.

00:20.353 --> 00:23.187
Second of all, there are so many people on the subway!

00:23.547 --> 00:25.023
Why is it always so crowded?

00:25.241 --> 00:26.659
No privacy at all, either.

00:27.217 --> 00:30.387
People talk so loud on their cell phones, it's incredible.

00:31.470 --> 00:36.344
I respect what you said, but I still think you're better off on the subway than behind the wheel.

00:36.817 --> 00:41.185
First of all, you can use those 4 hours of time to do something useful.

00:41.681 --> 00:43.646
You can read books or the newspaper,...

00:43.981 --> 00:46.297
...or you can even take a nap if you have a seat.

00:46.829 --> 00:49.562
But there's no way you can do those things while driving.

00:50.073 --> 00:54.441
Second of all, taking the subway does not cost as much money as driving a car.

00:54.941 --> 00:57.736
You have to pay for gas and maintenance if you have a car,...

00:58.111 --> 01:00.559
...but that's not the case with public transportation.

01:01.212 --> 01:05.206
Speaking of public transportation, the subway is not the only means.

01:05.499 --> 01:06.564
There are buses, too!

01:07.111 --> 01:10.665
Let's see if there's a bus that runs between here and where you live.
