00:00.489 --> 00:00.739
Good evening.

00:02.211 --> 00:05.882
Tonight, I can report to the American people and to the world...

00:06.609 --> 00:08.816
...that the United States has conducted an operation...

00:08.960 --> 00:12.274
...that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda,...

00:13.219 --> 00:14.950
...and a terrorist who's responsible...

00:15.091 --> 00:19.491
...for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women, and children.

00:21.141 --> 00:22.452
It was nearly ten years ago...

00:23.209 --> 00:27.987
...that a bright September day was darkened by the worst attack on the American people in our history.

00:29.185 --> 00:32.721
The images of 9/11 are seared into our national memory.

00:33.653 --> 00:37.703
Hijacked planes cutting through a cloudless September sky,...

00:38.567 --> 00:43.683
...the Twin Towers collapsing to the ground, black smoke billowing up from The Pentagon,...

00:44.715 --> 00:48.776
...the wreckage of Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania,...

00:49.231 --> 00:53.893
...where the actions of heroic citizens saved even more heartbreak and destruction.

00:55.069 --> 00:56.857
Today, at my direction,...

00:57.479 --> 01:03.245
...the United States launched a targeted operation against that compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

01:04.186 --> 01:09.057
A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability.

01:10.055 --> 01:11.491
No Americans were harmed.

01:12.251 --> 01:14.812
They took care to avoid civilian casualties.

01:15.708 --> 01:20.695
After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body.

01:22.277 --> 01:23.633
For over two decades,...

01:23.902 --> 01:26.387
...bin Laden has been al-Qaeda's leader and symbol,...

01:27.126 --> 01:30.955
...and has continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends and allies.

01:32.001 --> 01:35.223
The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date...

01:35.473 --> 01:37.531
...in our nation's effort to defeat al-Qaeda.

01:38.737 --> 01:40.765
Yet his death does not mark the end of our effort.

01:41.810 --> 01:45.129
There's no doubt that al-Qaeda will continue to pursue attacks against us.

01:46.047 --> 01:50.535
We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad.

01:51.927 --> 01:58.133
As we do, we must also reaffirm that the United States is not and never will be at war with Islam.

01:59.364 --> 02:04.162
I've made clear, just as President Bush did shortly after 9/11,...

02:04.758 --> 02:08.291
...that our war is not against Islam because bin Laden was not a Muslim leader.

02:09.155 --> 02:10.963
He was a mass murderer of Muslims.

02:11.875 --> 02:16.007
Indeed, al-Qaeda has slaughtered scores of Muslims in many countries including our own.

02:16.983 --> 02:21.675
So his demise should be welcomed by all who believe in peace and human dignity.

02:22.755 --> 02:27.874
And tonight, let us think back to the sense of unity that prevailed on 9/11.

02:29.071 --> 02:31.721
I know that it has, at times, frayed.

02:32.837 --> 02:36.497
Yet today's achievement is a testament to the greatness of our country...

02:37.203 --> 02:39.641
...and the determination of the American people.

02:40.912 --> 02:44.069
The cause of securing our country is not complete but...

02:44.809 --> 02:49.458
...tonight we are once again reminded that America can do whatever we set our mind to.

02:50.805 --> 02:55.747
That is the story of our history. Whether it's the pursuit of prosperity for our people,...

02:56.419 --> 02:59.100
...or the struggle for equality for all our citizens,...

02:59.957 --> 03:02.674
...our commitment to stand up for our values abroad,...

03:03.593 --> 03:06.968
...and our sacrifices to make the world a safer place.
