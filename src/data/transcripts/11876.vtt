00:00.160 --> 00:06.650
OK. So, we have the Will Smith, Abe Hiroshi duo, and he's an actor. They're both actors which you admire.

00:06.970 --> 00:07.580
Yeah, definitely.

00:10.570 --> 00:13.640
Will Smith isn't the first name that comes to your head when you think of somebody you'd like to emulate?

00:15.230 --> 00:19.000
He's definitely, probably the first person I think of, but...

00:19.640 --> 00:25.350
...my style, I hope I can, you know, have a range like say, Will Smith,...

00:26.170 --> 00:29.900
...Johnny Depp takes some really unique roles.

00:30.170 --> 00:30.610
Yes, he does.

00:32.330 --> 00:34.720
I would say him. I would definitely say Laurence Fishburne.

00:35.580 --> 00:35.910
Ah?

00:36.190 --> 00:42.370
Yeah, 'cause he plays really obscure roles, just things you would never think of.

00:42.920 --> 00:47.720
And there's a lot of new actors that are coming up anyway, when you're taking a look at him and saying, "He's really good."

00:47.880 --> 00:50.240
Like "Hurt Locker," have you seen it?

00:50.630 --> 00:51.770
Not seen it, I don't know.

00:52.070 --> 00:52.990
Definitely should watch it.

00:54.350 --> 00:55.600
It is a bit heavy, though.

00:55.820 --> 00:56.060
Yeah.

00:56.710 --> 00:59.050
It's a bit heavy but the acting is really good.

00:59.180 --> 00:59.370
Really?

00:59.600 --> 00:59.790
Yeah.

01:00.270 --> 01:02.550
And there's an actor there whom I should pay attention to?

01:02.770 --> 01:06.290
Yeah, as a matter of fact, if you're into comic book movies, I'm kind of a geek,...

01:06.770 --> 01:09.280
...he's gonna be playing Hawkeye in the new Avengers movie.

01:09.750 --> 01:10.100
Really?

01:10.850 --> 01:12.790
So I'm gonna let you find out who it is and then you tell me.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.220
OK, you don't know his name?

01:15.680 --> 01:17.610
I do, but you need some homework.

01:17.830 --> 01:18.370
OK, I'll do that.

01:20.260 --> 01:23.230
'Cause I wouldn't be surprised that you don't interview him soon.

01:23.640 --> 01:28.400
'Cause I'm pretty sure he'll be coming here to promote another movie. I think "The Town".

01:28.870 --> 01:29.120
OK.

01:29.290 --> 01:29.400
Yeah.

01:29.640 --> 01:30.120
I saw "The Town".

01:30.410 --> 01:31.280
Yeah, he's there.

01:32.670 --> 01:34.710
OK, so that narrows it down.

01:34.880 --> 01:35.400
Yes, it does.

01:36.440 --> 01:42.380
I like "The Town". It was good, yeah, hard-boiled action movie.

01:44.470 --> 01:49.770
Ben Affleck kills people without much ado. He just walks in and kills people.

01:50.040 --> 01:50.280
Yeah.

01:50.500 --> 01:50.840
It's great.
