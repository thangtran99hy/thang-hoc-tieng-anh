What is your biggest failure?

00:02.860 --> 00:05.010
My biggest failure came with Forest Products.

00:05.180 --> 00:09.180
I had lost a two-million-dollar account after being there only six weeks.

00:09.570 --> 00:12.450
And I felt awful and I thought I was gonna lose my job.

00:13.350 --> 00:17.400
But luckily that didn't happen because I was very determined to get that account back.

00:17.760 --> 00:20.420
And what I did was I researched what went wrong,...

00:20.670 --> 00:23.610
...addressed that with the clients, and within six months I got them back.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.320
I even grew it to be a bigger account...

00:26.760 --> 00:29.250
...and right now it makes up a third of the company's business.

00:29.400 --> 00:33.570
So, I feel like I definitely learned my lesson and I won't be making that mistake again.
