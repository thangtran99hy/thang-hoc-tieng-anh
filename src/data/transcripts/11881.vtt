00:00.559 --> 00:01.638
I Got a Job!

00:02.792 --> 00:03.843
Hey, Mom! Guess what!

00:04.414 --> 00:07.862
Abbott Laboratories called me and said I got the job!

00:08.174 --> 00:09.441
I'm on cloud nine, Mom!

00:10.039 --> 00:11.721
You know how much I wanted this job.

00:12.313 --> 00:16.478
And, believe it or not, they are going to pay me 30,000 dollars a year!

00:16.831 --> 00:19.736
That's a lot of money for a person who just graduated from college!

00:20.415 --> 00:23.811
I can't believe I get to do what I enjoy, and get paid for it.

00:24.018 --> 00:24.814
I'm so lucky.

00:25.417 --> 00:27.265
I really feel good about myself now.

00:27.822 --> 00:30.990
I was feeling down because it seemed like nobody wanted to hire me.

00:31.544 --> 00:33.174
What are you talking about?

00:33.287 --> 00:36.763
Why wouldn't anybody want to hire a talented person like you?

00:37.287 --> 00:40.874
If I were an HR person, I would hire you in a heartbeat.

00:41.293 --> 00:43.162
You have a wonderful personality,...

00:43.468 --> 00:44.796
...your GPA is good,...

00:45.185 --> 00:46.505
...you are good at what you do.

00:46.869 --> 00:48.635
You are a perfect candidate!

00:49.018 --> 00:51.363
And I'm not just saying it because you're my son.

00:51.614 --> 00:52.641
I'm serious!

00:52.989 --> 00:55.711
Anyway, I'm excited about what you've done, son.

00:56.086 --> 00:57.753
I'm sure your Dad will be, too.

00:58.089 --> 00:59.334
Let me give him a call.

00:59.679 --> 01:01.387
Oh, and we should celebrate!

01:01.651 --> 01:03.505
I will throw a big party for you.

01:03.734 --> 01:04.670
How about that?
