You can reduce your risk for cancer by avoiding carcinogens. Here are some ways.

00:12.121 --> 00:16.588
You will need, non - styrene food packaging and organic foods.

00:17.083 --> 00:23.641
Step one: Avoid foam food packaging which contains styrene that can be transferred to food inside.

00:24.039 --> 00:26.190
Animal studies have shown a link to cancer.

00:26.755 --> 00:31.059
Styrene was found in the urine samples of 87% of people tested...

00:31.243 --> 00:33.602
...in a Center for Disease Control and Prevention study.

00:34.731 --> 00:40.948
Step two: Avoid taking your clothes to dry cleaners that use tetrachloroethylene as a cleaning compound.

00:41.567 --> 00:45.338
The agent has been found to cause liver cancer and leukemia in rats.

00:45.819 --> 00:50.657
Alternative dry cleaning compounds include silicon and hydrocarbon - based solvents.

00:51.313 --> 00:54.987
Step three: Limit your exposure to titanium dioxide...

00:55.105 --> 00:58.993
...which is found in cosmetics, paints, paper, and plastics.

00:59.406 --> 01:03.193
Animal studies have confirmed the compound's carcinogenicity.

01:04.081 --> 01:09.129
The jury is still out on whether titanium dioxide nanoparticles found in cosmetics...

01:09.211 --> 01:13.531
... can be absorbed by the skin and if they are absorbed what their effects would be.

01:13.942 --> 01:16.885
Step four: Avoid diesel exhaust.

01:17.297 --> 01:19.947
These fumes have been linked to cancer in animal studies.

01:20.465 --> 01:22.599
Since diesel fumes are practically everywhere,...

01:22.934 --> 01:27.779
...your best bet for avoiding them is probably to move to an unpopulated tropical island.

01:28.635 --> 01:33.287
Step five: Reduce your exposure to aromatic hydrocarbons by limiting...

01:33.426 --> 01:36.878
...your consumption of smoked, barbecued, or burnt foods.

01:38.291 --> 01:41.902
Step six: Consider eating more organic foods.

01:42.401 --> 01:46.534
Organic foods contain lower concentrations of problematic food additives.

01:47.024 --> 01:49.312
Now you can enjoy a long healthy life.

01:49.907 --> 01:50.544
Did you know...

01:50.933 --> 01:54.367
...approximately 100 new food and color additive petitions...

01:54.497 --> 01:57.513
...are submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration annually.

01:57.711 --> 02:02.191
Additives cannot be approved that they are found to cause cancer in humans or animals.
