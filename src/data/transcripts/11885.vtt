00:06.802 --> 00:10.499
Create an image that makes you feel comfortable, cool and confident.

00:11.369 --> 00:18.966
You will need light fabrics, padded shoulders, low-rise pants, v-neck sweaters,...

00:19.857 --> 00:24.187
...three-button blazers, monochrome colors and a belt.

00:24.857 --> 00:28.783
Step 1, find fabrics that skim your body without bunching or clinging...

00:29.008 --> 00:31.004
...to avoid rolls and lumps that embarrass.

00:31.437 --> 00:34.055
Lighter weight wools and other fabrics smooth your appearance.

00:34.809 --> 00:37.347
Step 2, draw attention away from your middle...

00:37.467 --> 00:40.187
...by avoiding sloped shoulders that draw the sight down.

00:40.657 --> 00:43.288
Emphasize your strength with tailored padded shoulders.

00:44.059 --> 00:47.534
Step 3, create a slimmer look with lines that thin you out...

00:47.601 --> 00:49.884
...or solid colors that seem to remove pounds.

00:50.428 --> 00:54.347
Be careful with patterns or loud colors that only draw attention to your round shape.

00:55.187 --> 00:59.268
Step 4, wear pants that have a shorter distance between the waist and crotch...

00:59.553 --> 01:01.549
...and that are not worn around the waist but on the hips.

01:01.880 --> 01:03.919
Don't wear a waist size that if too tight,...

01:04.017 --> 01:05.964
...will shorten your legs as it distends your belly.

01:07.161 --> 01:10.943
Go light on ostentatious jewelry, French cuffs, big cufflinks...

01:11.018 --> 01:13.435
...and anything that overemphasizes your imposing heft.

01:14.310 --> 01:16.758
Step 5, stock up on v-neck sweaters...

01:16.857 --> 01:19.154
...that draw attention to your chest and not the double chin.

01:19.577 --> 01:22.197
Turtlenecks will make you look like a squat, rotund turtle.

01:22.747 --> 01:26.398
Wear shirts with pointed collars that will also change the impression of thickness.

01:27.433 --> 01:31.220
Straighten your posture. Make it a habit to stand erect and taller.

01:31.826 --> 01:35.027
Step 6, choose three-button blazers which will hold you in better...

01:35.208 --> 01:37.775
...rather than a two-button that will let the midsection dominate it.

01:37.994 --> 01:41.011
Open the top button to look casual and not restricted by the jacket.

01:41.512 --> 01:44.397
Avoid double vents in back, which make the bottom seem wider.

01:44.885 --> 01:48.521
Step 7, choose less contrasting colors for shirts and pants.

01:48.766 --> 01:52.825
Wear a conservative belt without trying to squeeze your tummy in which never works.

01:53.431 --> 01:55.657
Enjoy the slim down appearance you've created.

01:56.148 --> 01:56.679
Did you know?

01:57.232 --> 02:00.871
With the advent of the motor car, mass advertising and World War I,...

02:01.219 --> 02:05.079
...men's wear became more casual for the first time starting in the 1920s.
