Tell me about yourself.

00:02.051 --> 00:07.696
Well, I have six and a half years of medical sales experience covering a very large territory...

00:07.855 --> 00:09.191
...to bring to this position.

00:09.777 --> 00:12.543
So, I'm self - motivated and I can work alone.

00:13.387 --> 00:16.403
During that time, I had valuable opportunity...

00:16.488 --> 00:20.161
...to interact with doctors and other medical professionals,...

00:20.825 --> 00:25.788
...whether it was through new product demonstration or in-service training.

00:26.646 --> 00:29.883
Or sometimes I would just drop in so it's more of a cold call situation.

00:30.472 --> 00:32.710
So I'm hardworking and I'm reliable,...

00:33.213 --> 00:36.503
...and I think this really makes me a great asset for your company.

00:37.450 --> 00:42.026
My personality is easygoing, so I get along with most people,...

00:42.643 --> 00:48.489
...and my ability to laugh at myself puts people at ease in tense situations.

00:50.334 --> 00:55.275
I have great communication skills and I'm very comfortable with public speaking.

00:56.113 --> 01:01.600
And I can present complex information in really easy-to-understand ways.

01:02.447 --> 01:07.777
So I think with all of that combined, I really have a lot to offer your company.
