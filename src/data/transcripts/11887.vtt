Korea has four distinct seasons: spring, summer, fall and winter.

00:08.160 --> 00:10.163
Spring and fall are very pleasant.

00:10.572 --> 00:12.991
The weather is nice and the flowers are beautiful.

00:13.634 --> 00:18.201
When the leaves change, many people go hiking or go for a walk in the park...

00:18.357 --> 00:20.001
...just to enjoy the pretty colors.

00:20.606 --> 00:24.657
The only problem I have with those two seasons is that they are too short.

00:25.273 --> 00:29.319
It seems that the summer and the winter last longer than the spring and the fall.

00:29.993 --> 00:32.717
It is a shame that the mild seasons go by quickly...

00:33.082 --> 00:35.595
...and the intense seasons stay with us longer.

00:36.626 --> 00:39.757
One of the many things that I don't like about the Korean summer...

00:40.097 --> 00:43.715
...is the heat wave that almost always comes after the monsoon season.

00:44.527 --> 00:49.375
The weather forecast even warns against people getting frustrated because of the humidity...

00:49.791 --> 00:51.471
...and gives advice to take it easy.

00:52.271 --> 00:54.943
It's too bad that the weather can cause such stress.

00:55.540 --> 00:58.309
But when it gets really hard to concentrate on anything...

00:58.666 --> 01:00.633
...and it feels like you're going out of your mind,...

01:01.035 --> 01:04.258
...you know it's time to take a break, pack up and get away.
