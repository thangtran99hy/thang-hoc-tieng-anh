00:02.565 --> 00:03.363
I like eating out.

00:03.763 --> 00:06.659
I would say I probably eat out about three times a week.

00:07.318 --> 00:08.763
My favorite is Japanese food.

00:09.125 --> 00:10.990
I like almost everything they serve:...

00:11.183 --> 00:13.961
...the sushi, the noodles, and the fried vegetables.

00:14.608 --> 00:17.280
They also have full - course authentic Japanese meals,...

00:17.728 --> 00:21.381
...but I rarely get them because they're expensive and it's too much food.

00:22.130 --> 00:25.775
Without a doubt, I prefer eating out to cooking because I live by myself.

00:26.547 --> 00:28.092
I cook when I have company over,...

00:28.306 --> 00:31.182
...but otherwise, I am more likely to go out with friends for dinner.

00:31.843 --> 00:34.296
I find cooking only for myself depressing.

00:34.893 --> 00:40.146
It is also a waste of time and it also costs less for me to eat out than to go grocery shopping.

00:40.947 --> 00:44.322
I live in a neighborhood where there are a lot of ethnic food restaurants.

00:44.906 --> 00:46.686
I like trying out different kinds of food.

00:47.074 --> 00:49.694
Luckily, I have a friend who enjoys the same thing.

00:50.411 --> 00:53.390
Tonight, we're going to a new Indian restaurant to try their curry.

00:53.671 --> 00:54.381
I can't wait!

00:54.855 --> 00:55.923
I hope it tastes good.
