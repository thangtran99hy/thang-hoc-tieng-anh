To Have Kids or Not to Have Kids?

00:04.601 --> 00:08.597
I'd guess that raising kids is one of the hardest jobs a person can do.

00:09.295 --> 00:10.350
As a rough estimate,...

00:10.661 --> 00:16.011
...I bet that 95% of mothers say it is a privilege to have children and watch them grow.

00:16.713 --> 00:19.510
It is a lot of work but they say it's definitely worth it.

00:20.134 --> 00:25.636
Some of them even say anybody who is married but has no children does not have a complete life,...

00:26.031 --> 00:30.263
...because they never get to experience the joy and the sorrow that children bring.

00:31.323 --> 00:34.223
But there are many couples who are reluctant to have kids.

00:34.861 --> 00:39.276
They say that even though they want to have children, realistically it is difficult.

00:40.067 --> 00:43.216
Even if the mother wants to stay at home to take care of the baby,...

00:43.675 --> 00:45.571
...she might be forced to go back to work...

00:46.017 --> 00:51.091
...because her husband's salary might not be enough to support the additional member of the family.

00:52.413 --> 00:56.760
If the mother goes to work, she needs to find somebody who can watch the baby.

00:57.561 --> 01:00.066
Either she would send the baby to a daycare center...

01:00.443 --> 01:04.656
...or she might be lucky to have a close relative who would be willing to help her out.

01:05.437 --> 01:07.237
But either way, it costs money.

01:07.884 --> 01:12.179
So now, she and her husband have to work extra hard to pay for everything.

01:12.699 --> 01:14.003
It is a vicious cycle.

01:15.198 --> 01:18.097
Whether to have kids or not is an individual decision.

01:18.627 --> 01:19.873
But one thing is clear...

01:20.439 --> 01:23.488
...if more public support is provided for working mothers,...

01:23.843 --> 01:26.136
...more women would be happy to have babies.
