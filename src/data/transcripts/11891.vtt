It is a letter teachers across California have been afraid to get.

00:14.692 --> 00:18.071
Veronica Pellegrin recently received hers in the mail.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.873
Getting the letter and seeing we will no longer be employed,...

00:21.983 --> 00:23.849
...your services will no longer be required,...

00:24.673 --> 00:30.471
...it's very disheartening, to say the least, and frustrating.

00:30.827 --> 00:32.231
Pellegrin is not alone.

00:34.114 --> 00:40.108
60 percent of the teachers at Mariposa-Nabi primary school in Los Angeles received layoff notices.

00:40.571 --> 00:42.935
Salvador Rodriguez is the principal here.

00:43.623 --> 00:47.739
We have to keep going and making it the best year possible with all these changes.

00:48.263 --> 00:52.820
Even with a tighter budget, Rodriguez has been able to provide computers for his students...

00:53.269 --> 00:55.199
...but they are feeling the impact.

00:55.567 --> 00:58.443
He says there used to be 20 students to a teacher here.

00:58.924 --> 01:02.384
By next year, he expects nearly 30 students per classroom.

01:02.699 --> 01:06.451
Superintendent John Deasy heads the Los Angeles Unified School District,...

01:06.747 --> 01:09.483
...the second largest school system in the United States.

01:09.899 --> 01:14.923
He says in the past two years, the district has lost 10 to 12 percent of its staff,...

01:15.284 --> 01:17.104
...about half of them are teachers.

01:17.370 --> 01:22.434
The recession has had an enormous impact in the state budget...

01:22.720 --> 01:24.383
...and we've had a huge drop in funding.

01:24.837 --> 01:27.939
University of California Education Professor John Rogers says...

01:28.267 --> 01:31.807
...the recession has affected education funding across the country.

01:32.428 --> 01:37.878
Some projections estimate that across the country, 160,000 teachers have received...

01:38.179 --> 01:39.971
...layoff notices this spring.

01:40.369 --> 01:46.091
Rogers says the situation in California is worse because the state was already facing a budget deficit...

01:46.423 --> 01:51.577
...before the recession and the state was spending less per student than the national average.

01:52.021 --> 01:55.701
Primary and secondary schools in California receive most of their funding...

01:55.999 --> 02:00.540
...from the state government. That is about 40 percent of the state's general fund.

02:00.903 --> 02:04.282
United Teachers Los Angeles union President A.J. Duffy says...

02:04.692 --> 02:09.207
...how much schools get every year is vulnerable to the fluctuations of the economy.

02:09.788 --> 02:14.655
In the past two and a half to three years, we have lost 20 billion dollars...

02:15.180 --> 02:17.213
...in funding for public education.

02:17.577 --> 02:20.363
Superintendent John Deasy expects more changes...

02:20.661 --> 02:22.933
...if the budget problem does not improve.

02:23.211 --> 02:26.515
We are cutting all of our librarians, our nurses.

02:28.433 --> 02:32.135
We would be forced to close and consolidate schools.

02:32.447 --> 02:35.779
Most districts in California have reduced the number of school days.

02:36.182 --> 02:39.732
Other states around the country are also talking about cutting school days...

02:40.053 --> 02:42.619
...as they face less funding for education.
