00:02.301 --> 00:04.811
It was really warm over the last weekend.

00:05.267 --> 00:07.228
I guess the weather is going crazy.

00:07.677 --> 00:10.859
The temperature suddenly rose up to 12 degrees Celsius,...

00:11.218 --> 00:13.695
...and then today, it went down to minus seven.

00:14.406 --> 00:18.849
I remember that this summer, there was a typhoon called Nari that hit Jeju Island...

00:19.197 --> 00:20.649
...and it left a lot of damage.

00:21.242 --> 00:23.587
Korea has a really heavy rainy season.

00:24.131 --> 00:27.589
Compared to past years, how have the seasons in Korea changed?

00:28.029 --> 00:29.153
Let me recall.

00:29.682 --> 00:33.047
Well, there are usually four distinct seasons in Korea...

00:33.443 --> 00:37.369
...and it was easy to tell when a certain season begins and ends.

00:38.173 --> 00:41.329
But lately, we don't seem to have spring and fall...

00:41.672 --> 00:43.481
...my two favorite seasons!

00:44.035 --> 00:47.964
The weather is either extremely hot and humid or cold.

00:48.482 --> 00:52.378
I'm afraid to say it, but it all has to do with climate change.

00:52.997 --> 00:56.677
Climate change is one of the most critical global challenges of our time...

00:57.115 --> 00:58.940
...and it's time for us to take action.

00:59.517 --> 01:01.871
As we mentioned, not just in Korea,...

01:01.948 --> 01:08.721
...but other recent events around the world have emphatically demonstrated our growing vulnerability to climate change.

01:08.985 --> 01:13.669
Right, we really need to inform people about the potential changes in our weather.

01:14.359 --> 01:19.949
Tragic natural disasters like wildfires, typhoons, cyclones, and avalanches...

01:20.367 --> 01:23.534
...they all have to do with change in climate and global warming.

01:24.221 --> 01:28.403
Starting today, we have to look for what we can do to fight climate change...

01:28.707 --> 01:32.257
...which is the greatest environmental challenge facing the world today.
