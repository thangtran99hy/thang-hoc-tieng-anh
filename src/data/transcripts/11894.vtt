00:00.453 --> 00:02.206
The Power of Perception.

00:03.623 --> 00:06.667
Perception is a powerful thing in a social context.

00:07.395 --> 00:10.966
People tend to follow what they perceive to be the 'social norm.'

00:11.589 --> 00:14.627
For example, compared to a dry campus,...

00:14.897 --> 00:20.591
...students tend to drink more at a college campus where heavy drinking is viewed as the normal thing to do.

00:21.390 --> 00:25.131
The pressure associated with perceived social norms is huge.

00:25.815 --> 00:27.572
Take a friend of mine for instance.

00:28.123 --> 00:31.247
While in high school this fellow was as good as gold.

00:31.643 --> 00:35.385
Straight A student, polite, with clear career goals in mind.

00:35.933 --> 00:39.602
But in college, he joined a fraternity known for its heavy drinking,...

00:40.042 --> 00:43.664
...and even this boy allowed social pressure to get the better of him...

00:43.941 --> 00:46.569
...and he almost flunked out of college in his freshman year.

00:47.579 --> 00:52.312
The power of perception cannot be underestimated even on an individual level.

00:53.037 --> 00:56.286
Firemen tend to be viewed as being as brave as lions.

00:56.892 --> 01:01.766
A new fireman, who actually might be quite frightened of the idea of rushing into a burning building,...

01:02.070 --> 01:05.848
...might find himself actually doing that when confronted with the situation...

01:06.203 --> 01:08.783
...because he knows that others expect him to do so,...

01:09.169 --> 01:13.257
...and automatically perceive him to be a brave man because he is a fireman.

01:14.113 --> 01:16.033
Except for a few strong-willed people,...

01:16.409 --> 01:20.098
...most succumb to the powerful persuasion of social expectation.
