00:03.740 --> 00:06.521
It is difficult to balance time between work and life.

00:07.013 --> 00:11.869
In today's fast - changing world, everybody works hard and is as busy as a bee.

00:12.537 --> 00:15.767
Many people cannot enjoy a completely rewarding personal life.

00:16.393 --> 00:21.119
Focusing too much on work results in a life out of balance and eventually in stress.

00:21.859 --> 00:24.973
One thing that stresses out a lot of people is the task of cleaning.

00:25.576 --> 00:30.087
It seems unjust that in this modern world, it takes just as long for you to clean your house...

00:30.502 --> 00:33.256
...as it took your grandmother's grandmother to clean hers.

00:34.049 --> 00:37.909
If you're overwhelmed by cleaning, you need to rethink your cleaning priorities.

00:38.484 --> 00:42.525
Even if you don't make the bed for one day or don't do the dishes after a meal,...

00:42.904 --> 00:44.787
...that doesn't affect the quality of your life.

00:45.343 --> 00:48.963
Only do what absolutely needs to be done and let the other things go.

00:49.595 --> 00:52.069
Plan your cleaning schedule to fit your work schedule.

00:52.581 --> 00:54.371
Leave big tasks for your day off.

00:54.818 --> 00:57.620
Nobody expects you to be a superman or a superwoman.

00:58.165 --> 01:00.848
Remember, balance doesn't mean doing everything.

01:01.405 --> 01:04.108
And maintaining balance is better than running ragged.
