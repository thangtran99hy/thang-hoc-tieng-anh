Hi, are you in there?

00:02.618 --> 00:04.326
If you are, can this happen another day?

00:07.782 --> 00:09.493
So you're getting rid of your old stuff?

00:09.605 --> 00:12.256
I got fired from my job and my wife left me.

00:12.344 --> 00:14.436
If I'm honest, I saw this coming a mile away.

00:14.741 --> 00:15.636
Thanks for warning me.

00:19.797 --> 00:22.077
We've gotten some complaints about someone living on their lawn.

00:22.315 --> 00:25.346
This is my corner, I'm not leaving my stuff.

00:25.455 --> 00:30.293
The City of Arcadia allows a property owner to hold a yard sale for no more than five consecutive days.

00:30.393 --> 00:31.560
This buys you three days.

00:32.317 --> 00:34.318
I was thinking, you might wanna come work for me?

00:34.467 --> 00:36.028
Stay here, you sell a couple of things.

00:36.479 --> 00:37.164
What are you offering?

00:37.248 --> 00:39.762
I'll give you bathroom and cigarette breaks as required by state law.

00:39.990 --> 00:40.779
I don't smoke.

00:41.219 --> 00:41.851
Good. Great.

00:45.994 --> 00:47.809
You know, you can't live like this.

00:47.909 --> 00:48.357
Why not?

00:48.521 --> 00:49.429
It's not normal.

00:49.715 --> 00:50.526
How much for this?

00:51.159 --> 00:53.038
You wanna buy that? 50 cents?

00:53.255 --> 00:54.379
I'll give you 25 cents.

00:54.606 --> 00:55.479
Yeah, I just can't do that.

00:55.578 --> 00:58.018
Once you get rid of all that stuff, you're gonna feel great!

01:04.603 --> 01:07.447
Just wanted you to know, I'm selling it, all my stuff...

01:08.033 --> 01:09.341
...and it feels pretty good.

01:14.593 --> 01:17.768
You have a good heart Nicholas, that doesn't change.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.638
How much have you had to drink?

01:19.937 --> 01:21.153
In my opinion, not enough.

01:21.258 --> 01:22.167
You're gonna have to come with me.

01:22.806 --> 01:24.215
I wanna learn to play baseball.

01:25.783 --> 01:26.863
Why don't you wanna play soccer?

01:27.241 --> 01:28.405
Black people don't play soccer.

01:29.001 --> 01:30.796
Whole continents of black people play soccer.
