00:00.020 --> 00:02.240
I've got my own problems to worry about.

00:02.490 --> 00:04.840
Those people in Africa don't wanna help themselves.

00:04.980 --> 00:06.440
It's their mess, why should I care?

00:06.660 --> 00:09.020
Their problems are too big to solve.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.240
Stop wasting my hard-earned money.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.740
Hey, I'm as compassionate as the next guy.

00:13.940 --> 00:16.630
But it's like throwing money down a rat hole.

00:16.900 --> 00:18.630
Nothing will ever change.

00:19.260 --> 00:20.010
I give up.

00:20.460 --> 00:21.170
I give up.

00:21.570 --> 00:22.810
I give up.

00:23.310 --> 00:24.180
What's the point?

00:24.530 --> 00:25.560
Where's the proof?

00:26.760 --> 00:30.490
Actually, SMART programs are saving lives.

00:30.630 --> 00:34.440
In just ten years, over 15 million more kids are alive.

00:34.640 --> 00:37.730
And over 46 million more kids are in school.

00:38.050 --> 00:40.130
All for less than one percent.

00:40.320 --> 00:43.330
One percent. One percent of the total US budget.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.150
How's that for proof?

00:45.450 --> 00:48.980
And today, there are new vaccines that can save millions of more kids.

00:49.260 --> 00:50.720
But it won't happen without you.

00:51.080 --> 00:52.790
Go to one.org and join the movement.

00:53.160 --> 00:56.400

00:56.830 --> 00:59.750
