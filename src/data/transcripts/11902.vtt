Alex, can I ask you what you do exactly?

00:05.750 --> 00:07.559
Sorry, if you have already told me.

00:07.930 --> 00:12.625
I work for this communication company where I'm positioned as a foreign correspondent.

00:13.323 --> 00:15.224
One of my colleagues told me the other day...

00:15.516 --> 00:21.614
...that recent surveys indicate that there is an increasing number of youngsters in Korea who wish to do service jobs.

00:22.253 --> 00:24.415
But what's interesting on the opposite side of that...

00:24.743 --> 00:28.811
...is that almost one third of parents want their kids to work government jobs.

00:29.490 --> 00:33.425
They also see becoming a CEO, Chief Executive Officer...

00:33.815 --> 00:38.799
...or professional businessman, professor, or medical career will promise a good life.

00:39.517 --> 00:43.381
Parents say those jobs are stable and will make some good money too.

00:43.989 --> 00:47.129
But I hope parents let their children choose what they want to be...

00:47.490 --> 00:49.953
...and help their children find what they are really good at.

00:50.627 --> 00:51.451
You are right.

00:51.967 --> 00:56.061
The best job is one that you find yourself enjoying, and being good at.

00:56.569 --> 00:58.831
I want to move on to talk about these new jobs.

00:59.303 --> 01:03.366
My friend told me a list of these new occupations that I've never heard of.

01:03.922 --> 01:06.014
Let's see if that applies to you, too.

01:06.565 --> 01:09.174
Have you heard about a job called a tour conductor?

01:09.703 --> 01:11.417
What about a food stylist?

01:12.055 --> 01:13.021
A lotto designer?

01:13.489 --> 01:14.495
A jumpmaster?

01:14.933 --> 01:19.265
I can imagine what they are, but I have never heard about or seen one.

01:19.901 --> 01:22.290
But those jobs certainly sound interesting!

01:23.055 --> 01:27.109
If I am given a chance to become one of those new occupations,...

01:27.457 --> 01:29.395
...I'd like to become a food stylist.

01:29.792 --> 01:35.191
I really love food, so I even love to arrange food for special occasions like a big party.

01:35.972 --> 01:40.996
I would be very happy if people eat the delicious food decorated and arranged by me.

01:41.707 --> 01:43.005
Isn't it a great idea?
