What's your blood type, Alex?

00:04.441 --> 00:06.549
I'm very much aware that in the West,...

00:07.011 --> 00:11.403
...people do not care about, talk about or even know about their own blood type.

00:11.782 --> 00:16.563
But don't you need to know for when you donate your blood or for if you ever need a donation?

00:17.215 --> 00:20.872
How would you know what kind of blood you need in an urgent situation?

00:21.143 --> 00:24.976
I don't think we, as donators, need to know such information.

00:25.560 --> 00:31.013
Speaking of blood type, it was very interesting to see how Korean people, in fact Japanese too,...

00:31.339 --> 00:34.101
...are crazy about knowing other people's blood type.

00:34.718 --> 00:37.901
One disappointing thing about knowing one's blood type...

00:38.333 --> 00:43.485
...is that people prejudge what kind of person you are even before they get to know you better.

00:44.313 --> 00:47.663
I heard that the relationship between blood type and personality...

00:48.123 --> 00:51.450
...hasn't been scientifically or statistically proven.

00:52.091 --> 00:55.398
When I was 19 years old, I did donate my blood at school,...

00:55.749 --> 00:58.037
...but they never told me what kind of blood I have.

00:58.397 --> 00:58.999
I see.

00:59.541 --> 01:04.429
I know mine because I heard it from a hospital when I had surgery to remove my appendix.

01:04.923 --> 01:10.884
I asked them about my blood type because they had to send a sample of my blood to a special institution.

01:11.428 --> 01:14.291
Anyways, I think people shouldn't prejudge others.

01:14.714 --> 01:16.580
Don't judge a book by its cover.

01:16.762 --> 01:17.579
Absolutely.

01:17.835 --> 01:19.945
We never judge people by their looks.

01:20.507 --> 01:21.873
Speaking of the blood type,...

01:22.339 --> 01:25.745
...how on earth do we know their characteristics just by blood type?

01:26.045 --> 01:27.173
I think it's impossible.

01:27.853 --> 01:31.022
I believe blood type should be used for medical purposes only.

01:31.553 --> 01:33.923
No one should be judged by their blood type.

01:34.167 --> 01:35.177
That's nonsense.
