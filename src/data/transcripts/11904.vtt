Do you remember when I told you about my friend who is getting married soon?

00:06.445 --> 00:09.459
The other day, she told me about this place she visited.

00:09.937 --> 00:11.374
She went there with her fiance...

00:11.797 --> 00:14.977
...and asked this old lady in a red dress some questions;...

00:15.549 --> 00:17.702
...like whether they're perfect for each other...

00:18.204 --> 00:21.007
...and how financially suitable they are for each other, and so on.

00:21.821 --> 00:27.287
Hmm, I guess they basically went there to know about, how shall I put it, destiny,...

00:27.527 --> 00:28.815
...you know, like the future.

00:29.473 --> 00:33.158
The old lady threw a handful of rice and started to mumble some words.

00:33.733 --> 00:38.213
To me, it sounded like a fortune teller, but in a more weird way.

00:38.981 --> 00:41.011
Is that some kind of tradition in Korea?

00:41.629 --> 00:43.243
Partially, I would say so.

00:43.708 --> 00:46.715
One thing that makes Korea very unique is shamanism.

00:47.224 --> 00:50.787
It's quite common to see people, especially those who are engaged,...

00:51.089 --> 00:53.009
...visit fortune tellers for a query.

00:53.436 --> 00:56.280
That being said, I love visiting palm readers.

00:56.759 --> 00:59.853
Anyhow, I watched those female shamans on TV.

01:00.127 --> 01:01.633
They are scary!

01:02.037 --> 01:05.728
It's totally different than the fortune tellers that we usually imagine;...

01:06.056 --> 01:08.911
...you know, an old witchlike lady with a crystal ball.

01:09.659 --> 01:14.338
I do actually remember seeing young people lining up for tarot cards on the streets,...

01:15.271 --> 01:17.165
...like you said, for palm readings.

01:17.635 --> 01:20.264
I've never tried any kind of shamanism before,...

01:20.667 --> 01:23.927
...but now, I'm kind of curious about my future too,...

01:24.450 --> 01:26.383
...so I'm going to try it next time.
