Do you read a newspaper every morning?

00:04.505 --> 00:05.811
When I get up in the morning,...

00:06.135 --> 00:11.775
...the very first thing I do is turn on my computer and look up the Internet sources up-to-date news.

00:12.365 --> 00:16.981
It seems like more and more people don't feel the joy of picking up a newspaper in the morning.

00:17.734 --> 00:21.095
When I was young, looking at my dad spreading a newspaper,...

00:21.450 --> 00:25.305
...I thought it was a very cool thing to do, and I still think so.

00:25.844 --> 00:30.164
Growing up mimicking my dad, I browse all the news headlines first,...

00:30.495 --> 00:33.346
...and then read stories on politics or economics.

00:33.755 --> 00:38.489
What about you, Alex, what kind of media tool do you use to get current issues?

00:39.243 --> 00:41.292
I hear news from the radio in the morning,...

00:41.653 --> 00:45.434
...and when I get to my workplace, I also look on the Internet, just like you,...

00:45.950 --> 00:52.361
...and then usually I talk about the stuff mentioned in the news with my colleagues during coffee breaks and lunchtime.

00:53.135 --> 00:55.557
At night, when I get home, I watch news on TV.

00:56.273 --> 00:59.433
Wow, after listing all of these things I do every day,...

00:59.841 --> 01:02.797
...I do pay a lot of attention to what's happening around the world.

01:03.517 --> 01:04.697
Let me ask you this.

01:05.133 --> 01:08.883
Do you believe that what's being said in the news is always true?
