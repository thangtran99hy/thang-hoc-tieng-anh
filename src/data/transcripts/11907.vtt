My Korean friend is getting married soon.

00:05.383 --> 00:08.184
It took like a century for her to find the right guy,..

00:08.788 --> 00:14.143
...but the funny thing is, she had been going out with this guy for like what, over 3 years,...

00:14.463 --> 00:17.631
...but ended up marrying another guy, who is super rich.

00:18.119 --> 00:23.015
I don't understand why she wouldn't marry the first guy because they seemed to love each other.

00:23.717 --> 00:25.805
You know what, maybe it's a whole different story:...

00:26.133 --> 00:28.071
...a romantic relationship and marriage.

00:28.523 --> 00:31.673
Hmm, I think most couples marry for love,...

00:32.107 --> 00:36.816
...but it sounds like some consider money, career or fame to be more important,...

00:37.317 --> 00:39.915
...which is not a completely ignorable factor.

00:40.433 --> 00:46.233
Let's see, when two people get married, they can't just live forever with only love.

00:46.665 --> 00:49.223
If they want to have a "happily-ever-after" life,...

00:49.624 --> 00:52.934
...to a certain extent, they should be financially stable.

00:53.457 --> 01:00.643
In Korea, we have matchmaking firms that list all your education history, family history, personal data and career...

01:00.780 --> 01:06.439
...with your income range attached to it so customers can meet the right person according to the data.

01:07.149 --> 01:09.281
But still, the most important thing is love. 

01:09.655 --> 01:14.787
Can you guarantee that two people who meet through the matchmakers will feel eternal love?

01:15.429 --> 01:17.239
Well, they might, but I doubt it.

01:17.841 --> 01:23.359
I guess the trend for couples in Korea is to regard environmental factors as more important.

01:23.780 --> 01:27.648
For example: family history, overseas experience, et cetera.

01:28.068 --> 01:32.331
Those nurturing factors are considered to be one of the crucial factors in marriage.
