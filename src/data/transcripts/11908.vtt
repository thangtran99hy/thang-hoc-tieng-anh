How often do you use disposable cups?

00:06.299 --> 00:08.673
Did you know that using disposable products,...

00:09.139 --> 00:13.751
...which are most often made from paper, plastic, cotton, or polystyrene foam...

00:14.223 --> 00:15.953
...are not good for the environment?

00:16.577 --> 00:20.699
I understand a lot of people use disposable goods because it's convenient.

00:21.067 --> 00:23.285
You can just throw them away after using them...

00:23.381 --> 00:25.758
...and you don't need to wash and reuse them.

00:26.275 --> 00:29.781
But not only are the disposables harmful for the environment,...

00:30.233 --> 00:32.391
...but they are also not good for your health.

00:32.899 --> 00:35.505
Have you heard about the term "environmental hormones"?

00:35.893 --> 00:37.851
Yes, let's see if I'm right about it.

00:38.487 --> 00:44.034
Isn't environmental hormones a term that refers to chemical substances present in the environment...

00:44.461 --> 00:46.611
...that disrupt a certain function of humans?

00:47.422 --> 00:52.560
Well, I did hear in the news that we get those environmental hormones from disposable products...

00:53.003 --> 00:55.451
...and that's why I always bring my own cup,...

00:55.873 --> 00:58.443
...so I don't waste or have to use disposable cups.

00:59.131 --> 01:04.784
But the thing is, I see Koreans using more disposable products compared to the country where I'm from.

01:05.463 --> 01:07.590
I guess Korean people are more mobile,...

01:07.931 --> 01:09.527
...and live in a state of "urgency".

01:10.468 --> 01:14.410
I like what you are doing to help reduce the number of disposable cups wasted.

01:14.947 --> 01:18.464
I think people should carry around their own cups, or other utensils,...

01:18.871 --> 01:20.557
...especially at their workplace.
