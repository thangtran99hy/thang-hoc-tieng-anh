Korea's 17th presidential election is making headlines around the world!

00:08.210 --> 00:11.980
If you look at all of the foreign media talking about Korean politics,...

00:12.270 --> 00:15.410
...this should indicate that Korea is the center of attention.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.610
Let's assume that tomorrow is the election day.

00:18.950 --> 00:21.350
Which presidential candidate would you vote for?

00:21.780 --> 00:25.190
To tell you the truth, I actually haven't decided yet.

00:25.660 --> 00:30.030
But I have a list of qualifications that I thought the next president should have.

00:30.540 --> 00:34.200
Being a great president means, I guess, being a good leader.

00:34.600 --> 00:38.170
Now, a good leader should be a good message - oriented listener,...

00:38.500 --> 00:39.970
...and a good communicator.

00:40.470 --> 00:42.980
But the most important thing is whether or not...

00:43.090 --> 00:47.310
...he or she practically delivers and keeps what he or she pledges.

00:47.780 --> 00:48.710
What's your opinion?

00:49.080 --> 00:52.220
What qualifications do you think make a strong candidate?

00:52.580 --> 00:54.320
While I agree with your opinion,...

00:54.620 --> 00:57.360
...I also look for other qualities that stand out:...

00:57.920 --> 01:00.760
...a great person with a strong educational background,...

01:00.890 --> 01:03.600
...and progressive development of his or her career.

01:04.260 --> 01:08.870
Also, I think the candidate should have equal proficiency in two languages.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.940
For instance, the new Prime Minister of Australia,...

01:12.100 --> 01:16.140
...Kevin Rudd is perfectly fluent in English and Chinese.

01:16.740 --> 01:18.110
It might not be a big deal,...

01:18.280 --> 01:23.350
...but when an important figure like President or Prime Minister speaks two languages perfectly,...

01:23.850 --> 01:26.920
...he can build strong relationships with neighboring countries.

01:27.390 --> 01:28.450
That's my point of view.
