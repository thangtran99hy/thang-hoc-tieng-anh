Hello! Welcome to "Michael's Better Business English".

00:04.409 --> 00:07.074
This month we're looking at how to be tactful.

00:08.029 --> 00:10.110
Now, tactful is a little bit of a difficult word.

00:10.817 --> 00:16.365
Tactful means to be sensitive, to avoid hurting other people's feelings.

00:17.071 --> 00:20.433
This is very important when you're giving bad news,...

00:20.845 --> 00:24.215
...introducing a negative topic, or criticizing someone.

00:25.398 --> 00:26.523
How can you do this?

00:27.091 --> 00:29.729
Well, there are three steps to being tactful.

00:30.619 --> 00:32.321
Step one, signal.

00:33.076 --> 00:38.431
Signal means to signal to the listener some bad news or negative topic is coming.

00:39.187 --> 00:44.824
And we use words like, "unfortunately," "regrettably," "with regret".

00:45.869 --> 00:50.430
This lets the listener know something bad is coming and it helps them prepare.

00:51.769 --> 00:54.572
Second, use some kind of qualifier.

00:55.605 --> 01:00.952
A qualifier is some expression like "it seems" or "it appears".

01:01.435 --> 01:03.400
This has a softening effect.

01:05.103 --> 01:07.186
Third, use a modifier.

01:08.038 --> 01:11.370
Modifiers are words like "slight" or "small".

01:11.931 --> 01:14.883
For example, "We have a slight problem with the delivery."

01:15.867 --> 01:21.169
These words make it feel less and underplay the negative topic.

01:22.381 --> 01:24.509
So, being tactful is not easy.

01:24.906 --> 01:27.929
But by using these three steps, you can do it.

01:28.773 --> 01:29.949
Thank you and good luck.
