After spending a few years in Korea,...

00:05.000 --> 00:09.280
...I found many Korean citizens trying to make a killing on the stock market.

00:09.680 --> 00:13.110
In fact, they are very much into making a lot of money,...

00:13.450 --> 00:17.150
...which also causes some bad social problems and incidents.

00:17.580 --> 00:19.320
I went to a bookstore the other day,...

00:19.590 --> 00:24.390
...and I realized there are many books published on making a lot of money instantly,...

00:24.630 --> 00:26.330
...or how to grow their funds.

00:26.790 --> 00:31.100
Are you also interested in financial technology securities or becoming rich?

00:31.370 --> 00:35.070
If you are, is it because you are jealous of people who are rich?

00:35.470 --> 00:38.000
Well, it would be a lie if I said no...

00:38.440 --> 00:40.200
...I'm interested in making a lot of money.

00:40.740 --> 00:44.910
Most people, generally speaking, are jealous of people who are wealthy,...

00:45.240 --> 00:48.310
...but at the same time, they envy the wealth too.

00:48.750 --> 00:51.250
The feeling of envy comes when ordinary people...

00:51.340 --> 00:53.220
...look at millionaires or billionaires.

00:53.840 --> 00:56.290
Their fortune sounds quite unrealistic.

00:56.860 --> 00:57.820
Let's hear from you,...

00:58.160 --> 01:00.760
...are you jealous of Jack Welch or Bill Gates?

01:01.160 --> 01:02.560
I bet you feel envious.

01:02.860 --> 01:03.490
True.

01:03.730 --> 01:07.700
I read books about them so I can grasp their strategies or beliefs.

01:08.300 --> 01:10.870
In doing so, I wish I could be like them one day.

01:11.470 --> 01:13.070
I don't know about how to be super rich,...

01:13.230 --> 01:14.740
...or what makes a person rich,...

01:15.040 --> 01:16.140
...but what I do know...

01:16.310 --> 01:20.710
...is that being wealthy doesn't necessarily mean having incredible amounts of money.

01:21.240 --> 01:21.650
In fact,...

01:21.950 --> 01:24.380
...as long as you can afford your needs and wants,...

01:24.580 --> 01:26.120
...then that means you are rich.
