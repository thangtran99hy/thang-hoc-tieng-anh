00:00.593 --> 00:02.631
The Importance of Communication.

00:03.917 --> 00:08.623
There might be nothing more important than efficient communication in the success of a company.

00:09.257 --> 00:12.543
For example, if an organization has a great product,...

00:12.857 --> 00:16.836
...it won't be able to sell it without communicating the product to the greater world.

00:17.522 --> 00:23.099
Within an organization, interpersonal communication skills are critical to the success of the company,...

00:23.500 --> 00:25.691
...from management down and vice versa.

00:26.152 --> 00:29.359
However, despite the importance of communication,...

00:29.675 --> 00:33.955
...it is largely agreed that not everyone is cut out for effective communication.

00:34.609 --> 00:40.901
A very bright scientist may have all the confidence in the world when it comes to studying atomic particles in his lab,...

00:41.455 --> 00:44.644
...but ask him to present the status of his project to management...

00:45.075 --> 00:49.840
...and he might be totally worried about his inability to communicate his ideas publicly.

00:50.556 --> 00:54.000
Likewise, an effective manager skilled at public speaking...

00:54.145 --> 00:58.283
...may be ill at ease when confronted with a one-on-one interview with a subordinate.

00:59.424 --> 01:03.248
A secretary skilled at answering phones and handling disgruntled people...

01:03.625 --> 01:07.803
...may be uncomfortable when told she will be required to stand at the upcoming luncheon...

01:08.194 --> 01:09.853
...and introduce herself to everyone.

01:10.581 --> 01:11.355
Let's face it,...

01:11.739 --> 01:15.725
...communication is a universal skill requirement in all facets of life.
