00:00.585 --> 00:02.622
Obligations in a Free Society.

00:03.845 --> 00:07.387
In a free society, an individual may choose his own destiny.

00:07.958 --> 00:10.536
But despite endless options in a "free" society,...

00:10.986 --> 00:14.547
...a person is not truly "free" to do anything he desires.

00:14.907 --> 00:20.695
For example, society establishes laws that each citizen is obliged to obey under threat of punishment.

00:21.339 --> 00:23.873
This is done to curtail actions by individuals...

00:24.286 --> 00:26.389
...that reduce the quality of life for others.

00:27.688 --> 00:29.969
Beyond laws upheld by governmental authority,...

00:30.391 --> 00:34.282
...in a free society there is another layer of restraint, which is religion.

00:35.018 --> 00:38.917
Each religion dictates rules that its followers are obliged to obey.

00:39.568 --> 00:43.707
Then, of course, there are the unavoidable rules each of us must obey as we grow up...

00:44.212 --> 00:46.309
...which are handed down to us by our parents.

00:47.049 --> 00:51.342
Many times these rules are much harder to avoid than societal or religious law.

00:52.437 --> 00:55.467
There are many other expectations that are placed on people as well...

00:55.867 --> 00:59.479
...that are not laws, religious requirements, nor parental rules,...

00:59.849 --> 01:03.549
...but are social customs which become habits without any thought.

01:04.468 --> 01:07.630
All of these various obligations work toward a common theme,...

01:08.070 --> 01:11.948
...the peaceful coexistence of individuals in a free society.
