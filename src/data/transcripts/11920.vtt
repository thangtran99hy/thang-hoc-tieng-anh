00:09.883 --> 00:13.349
Blamed for terrorist atrocities on at least three continents,...

00:13.757 --> 00:18.982
...Osama bin Laden was the target of perhaps the largest US manhunt in history.

00:19.202 --> 00:22.499
But bin Laden's image as the world's most - wanted terrorist...

00:22.865 --> 00:27.199
...stands in sharp contrast to his peaceful and comfortable upbringing.

00:27.565 --> 00:29.559
Born March 10th, 1957,...

00:29.987 --> 00:34.175
...he was one of more than 50 children of a wealthy Saudi construction magnate...

00:34.517 --> 00:37.269
...who died when Osama bin Laden was a teenager.

00:38.457 --> 00:41.374
Raised in the opulence of Saudi Arabia's upper - class,...

00:41.807 --> 00:44.609
...rubbing shoulders with members of the ruling royal family,...

00:45.146 --> 00:47.844
...bin Laden went on to pursue an engineering degree...

00:48.245 --> 00:51.021
...and seemed headed for work in the family business.

00:51.905 --> 00:58.631
But his life forever changed when, in 1979, the former Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan.

00:59.063 --> 01:03.496
Bin Laden, like many Muslims, left home to join the fight against the Soviets.

01:04.356 --> 01:08.916
But in the mid - 1980s, bin Laden decided to use his share of his family's wealth...

01:09.295 --> 01:16.270
...to form his own militia force, which later became known as "al-Qaida", Arabic for "The Base."

01:16.807 --> 01:20.231
Another major turning point in his life came in 1990...

01:20.568 --> 01:23.936
...when Iraq invaded the oil - rich Persian Gulf state of Kuwait,...

01:24.593 --> 01:28.639
...prompting Saudi Arabia to invite US troops to deploy within its territory.

01:29.753 --> 01:31.999
Bin Laden saw the arrival of non - Muslims...

01:32.086 --> 01:35.895
...on what he considered holy land as an affront to Islam.

01:36.745 --> 01:38.635
He protested strongly against the move,...

01:39.018 --> 01:42.773
...resulting in his expulsion from Saudi Arabia in 1991.

01:43.355 --> 01:46.677
Stopping bin Laden became the top priority for the United States...

01:46.984 --> 01:50.144
...following the New York and Washington attacks in 2001,...

01:50.679 --> 01:52.977
...which claimed more than 3,000 lives.

01:53.971 --> 01:57.860
When the Taliban refused to surrender the al-Qaida leader to US authorities,...

01:58.207 --> 01:59.661
...the United States went to war,...

02:00.248 --> 02:06.714
...ousting the Taliban from Afghanistan in December 2001 and sending Osama bin Laden into hiding.

02:07.922 --> 02:13.731
In his years at large, bin Laden released a series of audio tapes condemning the United States,...

02:14.219 --> 02:16.173
...causing great frustration for Washington,...

02:16.975 --> 02:18.940
...a frustration that has now ended.
