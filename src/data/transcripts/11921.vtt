00:05.701 --> 00:06.757
Take a stroll on the Internet...

00:06.880 --> 00:09.847
...and it's hard not to notice that everyone's giving away points and badges...

00:09.998 --> 00:13.263
...for things like visiting a website or posting a comment...

00:13.662 --> 00:16.895
...or having your status update liked by social networking friends.

00:17.225 --> 00:20.134
The trend is called gamification and it's not just on the Internet.

00:20.616 --> 00:22.339
Now that everyone has a computer in their pocket,...

00:22.563 --> 00:25.681
...more and more physical world experiences are becoming gamified.

00:26.221 --> 00:29.843
Location - based services like foursquare award you with badges and status.

00:29.991 --> 00:32.457
You can compete to be mayor of your local pub, for example,...

00:32.580 --> 00:34.883
...just by checking in with your phone's GPS.

00:35.580 --> 00:38.123
Other services are springing up to award you with things like...

00:38.328 --> 00:40.623
...discounts on your health insurance for walking to work...

00:40.961 --> 00:45.043
...or giving you a virtual sword for your video game avatar if you buy a particular brand of soda.

00:45.549 --> 00:49.355
You can now even choose to get paid in virtual game currencies for doing real bits of work.

00:49.962 --> 00:51.143
It's all a bit gimmicky at the moment...

00:51.330 --> 00:52.233
...but there is some reason to think...

00:52.308 --> 00:55.223
...that blurring the line between real life and video games might have an upside.

00:56.045 --> 01:00.314
For one, our brains have evolved to give us a little squirt of dopamine when we play games.

01:00.537 --> 01:02.579
And we humans tend to be dopamine fiends.

01:02.839 --> 01:05.356
We get it for doing things that would have helped us back in the day,...

01:05.651 --> 01:09.303
...like eating, sex and, so the theory goes, play.

01:09.607 --> 01:13.799
And it's not just us humans. Animals all the way down the evolutionary tree play.

01:14.461 --> 01:18.889
Social mammals like apes, dolphins, monkeys and coyotes play all the time.

01:19.635 --> 01:22.509
But so do creatures that we branched away from a long, long time ago...

01:22.777 --> 01:24.690
...like turtles and even wasps.

01:25.123 --> 01:26.600
The games they play are all quite different...

01:26.702 --> 01:28.483
...and the exact purpose is a matter of some debate.

01:28.808 --> 01:31.729
Some think play is a way to learn and practice useful skills,...

01:32.011 --> 01:34.511
...others think it helps to build and maintain social bonds.

01:35.024 --> 01:37.193
Others still think it's just a way to release stress.

01:37.785 --> 01:41.016
Human play does all of this with the added bonus that we have language and writing...

01:41.197 --> 01:44.614
...and can create elaborate games with rules and points and reward systems.

01:44.856 --> 01:47.056
Some think this kind of play gets us ready to navigate...

01:47.139 --> 01:49.405
...the complex rules that allow civilization to work.

01:49.901 --> 01:52.637
But whatever the reason, there's no denying games have power over us.

01:52.939 --> 01:56.203
The thing is, it's only gonna get crazier. Why? Technology.

01:56.849 --> 01:59.549
Our phones already have GPS to track our locations,...

01:59.732 --> 02:01.416
...accelerometers to measure our movements,...

02:01.549 --> 02:04.487
...cameras to see our surroundings and screens to help us make sense of it all.

02:04.776 --> 02:07.057
But sensors and screens are getting cheaper by the day.

02:07.287 --> 02:08.790
Many predict that we will soon live in a world...

02:08.881 --> 02:10.748
...where it will be possible to embed cameras and screens...

02:10.918 --> 02:12.482
...in even the most mundane objects.

02:13.014 --> 02:15.494
Tie these altogether with the ubiquitous connection to the Internet...

02:15.691 --> 02:18.321
...and you have a world where everything we do can be tracked and measured.

02:18.756 --> 02:21.208
And anything that can be measured can be made into a game.

02:21.883 --> 02:23.825
How? Just add points.
