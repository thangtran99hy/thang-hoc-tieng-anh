00:00.268 --> 00:03.547
Don't tell anyone but there are really only four steps.

00:04.435 --> 00:07.917
One, find people. Two, give content.

00:08.267 --> 00:13.583
Three, capture their information. Four, stay in touch so you can sell them stuff.

00:14.035 --> 00:15.798
Here's another breakthrough in social media.

00:16.171 --> 00:19.012
You do not make money with social media.

00:19.519 --> 00:23.269
You make money by doing business with people that know, like and trust you.

00:23.782 --> 00:27.566
You market with social media to develop relationships with people...

00:27.629 --> 00:29.667
...so they will know, like and trust you.

00:30.103 --> 00:32.331
Then, and only then, will they buy from you.

00:32.492 --> 00:36.252
Instead of overloading yourself with thousands of social media sites,...

00:36.626 --> 00:40.907
...you can use some of the most popular search engine - friendly sites to accomplish these tasks.

00:41.492 --> 00:44.926
Find people interested in your products or services with the search tools...

00:45.281 --> 00:48.762
...from the 355 million people on Facebook,...

00:49.250 --> 00:51.931
...the 35 million business people on LinkedIn,...

00:52.223 --> 00:56.819
...or the estimated 50 million people who will be using Twitter by the end of the year.

00:56.988 --> 00:59.263
Provide content, not commercials.

00:59.457 --> 01:03.859
Content on the sites like the second most utilized search engine, YouTube.

01:04.434 --> 01:07.875
You could also write articles for online magazines like Ezine...

01:08.120 --> 01:11.321
...or make your own mini website or lenses on Squidoo.

01:11.897 --> 01:13.995
You can make a blog or set up HubPages...

01:14.262 --> 01:18.425
...or do about anything that delivers content like how-to videos or...

01:18.768 --> 01:21.688
...frequently asked questions about your area of expertise.

01:22.314 --> 01:24.044
You then make a lead capture page...

01:24.464 --> 01:28.712
...which offers people something of high perceived value, an ethical bribe...

01:29.035 --> 01:30.573
...for giving you their name and e-mail.

01:30.767 --> 01:34.806
This will allow you to send e-mails or newsletters and stay in touch with people...

01:34.983 --> 01:36.919
...who have requested more information from you...

01:37.047 --> 01:38.758
...and now see you as an expert.

01:38.931 --> 01:39.994
What does all of this do?

01:40.195 --> 01:43.676
One, it makes you credible. Two, increases referrals.

01:43.991 --> 01:46.445
Three, builds new relationships.

01:46.636 --> 01:51.821
Four, demands higher prices. Five, gives you outstanding visibility.

01:51.985 --> 01:56.655
Six, it increases familiarity. Seven, builds trust.

01:57.131 --> 02:00.335
Eight, you can then offer your product or services.

02:00.637 --> 02:03.933
Nine, because you are the perceived expert.

02:04.377 --> 02:07.468
In other words, it makes you "top of mind."

02:07.889 --> 02:09.785
It helps people know, like and trust you.

02:09.973 --> 02:13.413
Congratulations. You now get it. That's social media marketing.
