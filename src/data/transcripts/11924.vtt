00:03.370 --> 00:05.440
Until we open our mouths and speak...

00:05.620 --> 00:08.380
...exposing our personality to those around us,...

00:08.490 --> 00:11.710
...the only thing they have to go by to make an opinion about us...

00:11.810 --> 00:13.850
...is our physical body and appearance.

00:14.450 --> 00:18.350
Though it goes without saying that our minds are the most important part of us,...

00:18.680 --> 00:22.820
...our physical selves are also important and should be attended to.

00:23.320 --> 00:27.130
Just as we should always strive to improve our minds through education,...

00:27.390 --> 00:30.730
...we should strive to improve our fitness through physical training.

00:31.630 --> 00:33.500
Once you decide to exercise,...

00:33.730 --> 00:35.530
...you must then settle on a style.

00:35.900 --> 00:39.600
Are you going to weight train, or focus on cardiovascular health?

00:40.170 --> 00:42.570
I myself have decided to go with both.

00:43.110 --> 00:45.680
I do a mixture of free weights and machine weights...

00:45.980 --> 00:48.350
...and outside jogging and cardio machines.

00:48.990 --> 00:51.080
Once I feel that I'm in good enough shape,...

00:51.320 --> 00:53.750
...I've chosen to do some Yoga as well...

00:54.020 --> 00:55.350
...probably in the morning.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.590
It will warm me up for the day's exercise...

00:58.790 --> 01:01.060
...whether it is weight training or cardio.

01:01.300 --> 01:02.430
What is your plan?
