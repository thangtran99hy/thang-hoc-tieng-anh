00:00.617 --> 00:02.561
Life is Like a Box of Chocolates.

00:04.046 --> 00:06.516
Life throws curveballs at you all the time...

00:06.947 --> 00:10.016
...and it is impossible to know what the future holds for you.

00:10.745 --> 00:14.317
As Mrs. Gump said to her son Forrest in the movie Forrest Gump,...

00:14.814 --> 00:16.639
..."Life is like a box of chocolates,..."

00:16.885 --> 00:18.539
"...you never know what you're gonna get."

00:19.328 --> 00:23.878
I never intended on being a high - level executive of one of the biggest companies in the world.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.120
I actually wanted to be a fireman.

00:26.637 --> 00:30.034
However, one summer vacation during my sophomore year of college,...

00:30.452 --> 00:33.002
...my friend was upset that he could not go on a trip...

00:33.363 --> 00:36.922
...because the temp agency he worked for would not give him time off.

00:37.489 --> 00:39.154
So, I offered to cover for him.

00:39.510 --> 00:43.227
Little did I know that when I said "I wouldn't mind covering for you,"...

00:43.702 --> 00:46.026
...that I would begin the process of changing my life.

00:46.661 --> 00:48.706
Working for a temp agency was interesting...

00:49.095 --> 00:53.115
...and exposed me to all kinds of different office environments and situations.

00:53.716 --> 00:55.173
I loved doing things for people,...

00:55.534 --> 00:59.908
...and I was always going the extra mile, saying, "Would you like me to take the meeting for you?"...

01:00.424 --> 01:02.283
..."Just go home. I'll take care of this,"...

01:02.720 --> 01:04.792
...and "How about I do the report for you?"...

01:05.037 --> 01:06.614
..."I'm interested in the subject anyway."

01:07.260 --> 01:10.819
And so with experience, I have become a successful businessman.

01:11.491 --> 01:12.443
Success is simple.

01:12.714 --> 01:15.960
Go the extra mile and do things others don't want to do.

01:16.497 --> 01:20.617
Focus on your current task and job, and the future will come of its own accord.

01:21.038 --> 01:23.680
After all, life is like a box of chocolates,...

01:24.039 --> 01:26.183
...you never know what you're gonna get.
