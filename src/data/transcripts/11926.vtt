Kids And Technologies.

00:03.501 --> 00:06.875
Kids today are growing up completely accustomed to technologies.

00:07.231 --> 00:11.393
Often, they give absolutely no thought as to how a particular technology works...

00:11.813 --> 00:13.439
...or what mechanism is behind it.

00:13.996 --> 00:16.683
They just take the technological advancements for granted.

00:17.370 --> 00:19.871
A good example is my niece, who is 10 years old.

00:20.309 --> 00:23.095
She visited me and wanted to watch her favorite TV show.

00:23.655 --> 00:26.445
The show was on a cable channel, but I didn't have cable.

00:26.969 --> 00:31.627
She did not understand why she couldn't watch her show when there was a TV in my house.

00:32.231 --> 00:33.934
I told her I would sign up for cable,...

00:34.275 --> 00:38.054
...so that by the time it gets under way, she could watch her show at my place, too.

00:38.577 --> 00:40.791
She had no idea what that meant at all.

00:41.586 --> 00:45.456
Although my niece's example is extreme, with her being young and all,...

00:45.969 --> 00:48.167
...I see similar things with older kids as well.

00:48.833 --> 00:53.849
For example, my teenage nephew can use the computer and knows how to properly shut it down and all,...

00:54.343 --> 00:56.397
...but doesn't really understand how it works.

00:57.047 --> 01:00.987
It's funny that kids have very little understanding of the underlying technology...

01:01.397 --> 01:03.925
...while at the same time are very proficient at using it.

01:04.578 --> 01:08.072
What's even funnier is that as soon as their favorite TV show kicks off,...

01:08.565 --> 01:09.753
...they are quiet as mice,...

01:09.901 --> 01:13.250
...staring at the TV screen without a thought of the world around them.
