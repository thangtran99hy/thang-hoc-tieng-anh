00:00.810 --> 00:01.688
Spring Break.

00:02.762 --> 00:04.889
Today, I had another fight with my parents.

00:05.145 --> 00:08.591
It seems lately the fights are getting more frequent and more serious.

00:09.194 --> 00:11.263
Sometimes, I really don't get my parents.

00:11.925 --> 00:14.724
Actually, pretty much all the time I don't get my parents.

00:15.286 --> 00:17.021
They're always trying to control me.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.343
Don't they know that I am my own person?

00:20.045 --> 00:22.157
You'd think they were never kids themselves.

00:22.739 --> 00:24.290
I'm practically an adult anyway.

00:24.468 --> 00:26.175
Next week is my 17th birthday.

00:27.303 --> 00:29.210
This time, the fight was over spring break.

00:29.544 --> 00:31.057
It's my junior year of high school,...

00:31.458 --> 00:33.803
...and me and my friends want to go to Rio de Janeiro.

00:34.405 --> 00:36.939
The fight started when my father walked past my room...

00:37.289 --> 00:39.568
...and happened to see me trying on my new bathing suit.

00:39.715 --> 00:40.432
He freaked out!

00:40.521 --> 00:43.545
He said, "I forbid you to wear that outside the house!"...

00:43.637 --> 00:45.680
..."Take it off and bring it back to the store!"

00:46.493 --> 00:48.996
Then he asked me why I was buying bathing suits anyway,...

00:49.267 --> 00:53.963
...and I told him me and my friends are going to Rio for spring break, and his face turned purple!

00:54.110 --> 00:56.277
He said "I order you not to go!"...

00:56.358 --> 00:57.166
..."And that's final."

00:57.832 --> 01:01.849
So there it is, I can't go to Rio when all my friends will be going.

01:02.499 --> 01:05.999
I'll be stuck here all by myself in this crappy town...

01:06.134 --> 01:09.135
...in this crappy house with my crappy parents!
