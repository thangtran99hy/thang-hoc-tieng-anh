Spending Habits.

00:03.200 --> 00:06.370
Today I went to the mall with my Mom and my baby sister.

00:06.740 --> 00:10.240
My Mom totally embarrassed me by yelling at me in public!

00:10.640 --> 00:12.380
I mean, people were watching!

00:12.880 --> 00:15.250
My sister got scared and started crying.

00:15.410 --> 00:18.680
But Mom didn't stop screaming about my spending habits.

00:19.150 --> 00:19.820
I don't get it.

00:20.390 --> 00:23.520
Once she gives me allowance, doesn't that become my money?

00:24.120 --> 00:25.960
Why does she care what I spend it on?

00:26.390 --> 00:28.560
I don't criticize her shopping habits!

00:29.330 --> 00:30.830
Mom was saying stuff like,...

00:31.280 --> 00:33.500
..."I'm telling you to stay at home from now on."

00:33.850 --> 00:36.300
"You're not allowed to go out with your friends anymore!"

00:36.460 --> 00:37.340
"You're grounded."

00:37.700 --> 00:39.840
She said until I turn 18,...

00:40.090 --> 00:41.980
...the money she gives me is still her money...

00:42.180 --> 00:45.010
...and she has the right to tell me what to buy or what not to buy...

00:45.060 --> 00:45.910
...with that money.

00:46.610 --> 00:47.450
So, I have to wait...

00:47.640 --> 00:51.190
...two more years until I can spend my own money on what I want.

00:51.950 --> 00:53.490
I'm thinking of getting a job.

00:53.920 --> 00:56.260
I can work at the coffee house in my neighborhood.

00:56.790 --> 00:59.460
I also saw the "Now Hiring" sign at the chicken place...

00:59.610 --> 01:00.390
...near the mall.

01:00.890 --> 01:01.420
I mean,...

01:01.690 --> 01:03.900
...I'll do anything to make money on my own so that...

01:04.090 --> 01:05.600
...Mom doesn't nag anymore.

01:06.070 --> 01:08.000
I understand her nagging at home,...

01:08.150 --> 01:10.830
...but in public places? Give me a break!

01:11.230 --> 01:13.870
Parents can be so embarrassing sometimes.
