Eating Bad? Whose Fault Is It?

00:03.509 --> 00:07.667
Every one of us has to make decisions about what we eat every day of our lives. 

00:08.285 --> 00:10.750
The older we get, the more we think about this.

00:11.031 --> 00:13.575
However, it is also important when we are young,...

00:13.958 --> 00:16.062
...for poor nutrition in the formative years...

00:16.409 --> 00:19.157
...may lead to problems that don't appear until we are older.

00:19.521 --> 00:25.493
For example, low intake of calcium at an early age may lead to various bone disorders as we age.

00:26.033 --> 00:26.679
Consider this.

00:27.252 --> 00:29.206
In America where obesity is common,...

00:29.701 --> 00:32.933
...health complications related to obesity are a huge problem...

00:33.009 --> 00:35.322
...and increase the cost of health care for everyone.

00:36.005 --> 00:39.775
The issue has even been submitted to the courts to decide if the government...

00:40.151 --> 00:43.797
...or an individual food company is liable for damages to an individual...

00:44.236 --> 00:46.667
...if that individual has become sick, obese,...

00:47.095 --> 00:49.583
...or has health problems from eating too much bad food.

00:50.269 --> 00:52.845
I haven't settled on a position yet concerning this issue.

00:53.443 --> 00:55.788
But until the time when I come to a conclusion,...

00:56.229 --> 00:58.855
...I'm going to take responsibility for my own actions...

00:59.295 --> 01:04.953
...and not blame the government, or fast food restaurants, if I get fat from eating too much bad food.
