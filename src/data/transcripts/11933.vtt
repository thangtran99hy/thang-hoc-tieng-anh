Alex, you said that you will postpone buying a car because of the oil price hike, right?

00:08.404 --> 00:11.995
Well, I heard in the news that after a recent conference in Bali,...

00:12.439 --> 00:15.205
...a strategy to tackle global warming was drawn up.

00:15.781 --> 00:20.809
But this strategy called "The Road Map" does not specify any clear emissions goal,...

00:21.198 --> 00:24.237
...nor suggest which country should make emissions cuts...

00:24.341 --> 00:26.691
...or how deep these cuts should be.

00:27.151 --> 00:32.667
Rather, it just sets the framework for negotiations for a long - term agreement on emissions cuts.

00:33.429 --> 00:35.308
But well, after reading this article,...

00:35.793 --> 00:38.716
...I thought it was brave of you that you gave up getting a car,...

00:39.252 --> 00:43.991
...so now, you won't emit greenhouse gas, which includes carbon dioxide.

00:44.531 --> 00:50.303
That's one significant thing that we as citizens can do to reduce the level of carbon dioxide.

00:50.837 --> 00:52.608
It wasn't like I did that on purpose.

00:53.129 --> 00:57.925
But after all, I think it was a small action I could take to fight against global warming.

00:58.631 --> 01:01.061
I did also hear news about the Bali Road Map,...

01:01.492 --> 01:05.973
...and I was actually surprised to hear that developing countries such as China...

01:06.343 --> 01:09.181
...or other Asian countries should limit their emissions too.

01:09.977 --> 01:12.124
If you consider their economic development,...

01:12.522 --> 01:16.545
...the rule is not fair for them to cut back on emissions of greenhouse gases.

01:17.309 --> 01:23.130
Oh well, do you think the time will come when we have to purchase "clean air", like we do now with water?
