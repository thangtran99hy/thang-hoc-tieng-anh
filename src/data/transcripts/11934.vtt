Funeral.

00:02.065 --> 00:04.221
The other day when I was watching a movie,...

00:04.726 --> 00:06.168
...one question came to mind.

00:06.577 --> 00:10.691
Why don't people in the west express their sadness and sorrow at funerals?

00:11.275 --> 00:14.523
Imagine if your parents, siblings or loved ones passed away,...

00:15.029 --> 00:18.299
...how could you hold back sadness and be so frigid?

00:18.788 --> 00:22.468
Well, I understand that customs are different from place to place.

00:23.204 --> 00:24.563
I totally agree with you.

00:24.957 --> 00:29.073
I was actually shocked when I first saw how Koreans mark a person's death.

00:29.786 --> 00:32.542
I guess compared to the Western culture, like you said,...

00:32.965 --> 00:35.999
...Koreans express sadness and sorrow a lot more.

00:36.733 --> 00:37.686
Let me get this straight;...

00:38.152 --> 00:41.748
...is it correct that when people express their condolences,...

00:41.963 --> 00:44.325
...they do so by giving money? Why?

00:44.877 --> 00:45.840
This is true.

00:46.293 --> 00:47.383
I mean think about it!

00:47.849 --> 00:52.239
One of your loved ones has passed away and to make a bad situation worse,...

00:52.649 --> 00:55.927
...the expenses for the funeral service are quite costly.

00:56.389 --> 01:01.497
So, on the basis of reciprocity, you roll my log and I will roll yours.

01:01.953 --> 01:08.326
Anyhow, I think it's interesting to also consider many different religious aspects of funerals around the world.

01:08.848 --> 01:13.321
For example, Buddhist funerals are different than Catholic or Islamic ones.

01:13.658 --> 01:14.955
That's a good point, Mi-na.

01:15.513 --> 01:19.263
Each country's culture is also reflected in their funerals.

01:19.759 --> 01:22.401
That's why we can find a lot of differences among them.

01:23.587 --> 01:25.316
On the point of cultural differences,...

01:25.703 --> 01:28.875
...we will be able to understand the different funerals in the world.
