00:03.300 --> 00:04.610
Oh, I'm running late!

00:05.040 --> 00:07.810
My flute tutor is coming to my house in an hour,...

00:08.170 --> 00:11.010
...and after that, I have to go to an academy for math.

00:11.580 --> 00:14.250
I'm all tied up even during the weekend!

00:14.660 --> 00:17.050
But I don't see any dramatic improvement...

00:17.450 --> 00:20.490
...either in my academic or musical scores.

00:20.760 --> 00:23.260
Wait up! Mi-na had a suggestion.

00:23.520 --> 00:26.020
If you are too busy and sick of having lessons,...

00:26.320 --> 00:30.030
...why don't you stop going to academies and quit getting private tutoring?

00:30.650 --> 00:32.660
Why don't you just focus on your school work?

00:33.070 --> 00:34.670
Why are you wasting your time?

00:35.050 --> 00:36.600
It's easy for you to say!

00:36.970 --> 00:39.170
You can't survive in this education - based...

00:39.320 --> 00:42.700
...and highly competitive country without getting private lessons.

00:43.280 --> 00:45.010
The more private tutors you have,...

00:45.380 --> 00:46.980
...the better results you will see.

00:47.610 --> 00:51.450
I can't believe that I only take three extracurricular activities.

00:51.940 --> 00:53.890
Mi-na said that when she was my age,...

00:54.220 --> 00:56.920
...she spent all day after school at academies.

00:57.090 --> 00:58.160
I don't agree with you.

00:58.540 --> 01:03.020
I find this private education system in Korea quite problematic.

01:03.600 --> 01:07.500
You shouldn't judge a person based on school tests, or report cards...

01:07.700 --> 01:10.340
...because they can't tell you one's personality.

01:10.970 --> 01:13.610
But it seems like people in Korea are so competitive...

01:13.840 --> 01:16.940
...and passionate about entering big name universities.

01:17.580 --> 01:20.550
I understand that having a high - profile education...

01:20.830 --> 01:23.080
...might give you a better chance to make more money.

01:23.720 --> 01:27.790
But I think that how one can progressively show and...

01:27.960 --> 01:30.590
...demonstrate their abilities is more important.
