00:00.715 --> 00:03.113
Food. You know, I just couldn't stop thinking about it.

00:03.327 --> 00:03.560
Yeah?

00:04.189 --> 00:05.091
So, yeah.

00:05.211 --> 00:05.350
Yeah?

00:05.603 --> 00:08.741
So, you know, I went to the fridge and I opened up the meat drawer.

00:09.003 --> 00:10.057
You know what the meat drawer is, right?

00:10.829 --> 00:12.755
Yeah, what was in there?

00:12.918 --> 00:13.850
Well, I'll tell you what was in there.

00:14.589 --> 00:17.087
You know that bacon that's like maple?

00:17.789 --> 00:18.503
It's got maple flavor.

00:18.595 --> 00:19.611
The maple kind, yeah.

00:19.775 --> 00:20.349
Yeah so,...

00:20.684 --> 00:20.931
Yeah.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.252
...I took that out and I thought...

00:23.525 --> 00:23.719
Yeah?

00:23.977 --> 00:25.039
...I know who would like that.

00:25.932 --> 00:27.601
Me! So, I ate it.

00:29.504 --> 00:31.625
No, you're kiddin' me.

00:32.353 --> 00:34.568
Nope. Not kiddin'.

00:35.290 --> 00:38.367
You know, I also noticed there were some beef in there.

00:39.153 --> 00:40.905
Yeah, you know, steak.

00:41.229 --> 00:42.279
You know, juicy. 

00:42.471 --> 00:43.285
Well, I ate that too.

00:45.704 --> 00:49.301
But I went back to the fridge, just a few minutes ago.

00:50.353 --> 00:52.070
And I put something together really special.

00:52.223 --> 00:53.089
You're gonna love this one.

00:53.368 --> 00:54.306
I took some chicken,...

00:54.827 --> 00:55.032
Yeah?

00:55.187 --> 00:57.005
...yeah, I put some cheese on it.

00:57.401 --> 00:58.803
 Then, I covered it with...

00:58.977 --> 00:59.830
Covered it with what?

00:59.940 --> 01:01.099
...covered it with cat treats.

01:01.185 --> 01:01.484
Yeah.

01:01.818 --> 01:02.494
Then guess what?

01:02.726 --> 01:03.045
What?

01:03.515 --> 01:04.438
I gave it to the cat!
