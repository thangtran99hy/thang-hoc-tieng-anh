The most significant mistake so many leaders have made in the last 20 years,...

00:24.211 --> 00:25.647
...and it's very upsetting to me,...

00:26.179 --> 00:30.961
...is that they've put their self-interest ahead of the best interest of the institutions...

00:31.066 --> 00:32.414
...or organizations they run.

00:32.853 --> 00:35.069
And that to me is the greatest failing of a leader.

00:35.207 --> 00:39.419
If you're looking out for your own money, fame, power or glory, that's wrong.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.747
As Peter Drucker said, leadership is not about those things.

00:43.136 --> 00:44.275
It's about responsibility.

00:44.590 --> 00:48.251
And I think it's a deep responsibility you have to the people you work with,...

00:48.361 --> 00:55.271
...your customers, your employees, your shareholders and all those constituencies you represent.

00:55.745 --> 01:01.722
And that's an obligation and carrying that responsibility out is the essence of good leadership.

01:02.456 --> 01:05.267
I think the biggest mistake a leader can make or maybe the worst trait...

01:05.403 --> 01:08.143
...a leader can have is to not be self-reflective.

01:08.312 --> 01:10.979
So, the admired leaders that I've worked with...

01:11.097 --> 01:17.537
...and the people just in my own day-to-day that I've apprenticed myself to and really wanted to follow...

01:17.992 --> 01:20.919
...have been people who are constantly reviewing their own behavior,...

01:21.293 --> 01:23.723
...who are thinking about how they can develop themselves and...

01:23.929 --> 01:26.332
...thinking about how their behavior impacts other people.

01:26.802 --> 01:30.415
So, I think unless somebody is willing to hold up a mirror to themselves and...

01:30.544 --> 01:34.021
...have an honest to God conversation about how they're doing...

01:34.397 --> 01:37.647
...or what effect their leadership is having and what effect they have on other people,...

01:38.193 --> 01:40.480
...I don't think they'll be effective as leaders.

01:40.795 --> 01:44.057
And I think, conversely, the people who are the worst leaders are people who just...

01:44.477 --> 01:46.995
...bulldoze forward and plow forward through life,...

01:47.539 --> 01:51.199
...making mistakes, not really looking back on the past, not learning as they go,...

01:51.583 --> 01:55.726
...and not necessarily being self-aware about how they're affecting the people around them.
