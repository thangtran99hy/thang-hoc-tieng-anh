The most important point I could tell a startup today is...

00:05.158 --> 00:07.366
...the expectation is that you're already shipping...

00:07.862 --> 00:11.075
...and that you're not trying to raise money in order to create something to ship.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.703
So prototyping is everything.

00:13.933 --> 00:18.455
The concept of, "We'll raise some money then we'll write the software or create the product..."

00:18.797 --> 00:21.748
"...and then we'll ship and then we'll raise some more money," that don't fly anymore.

00:22.047 --> 00:24.125
So basically, you need to prototype,...

00:24.203 --> 00:27.298
...you need to ship and get it out there and get the cash flow.

00:27.811 --> 00:30.990
And may you never need venture capital but if you do need venture capital,...

00:31.388 --> 00:33.717
...you should use it for expansion, not for creation.

00:34.460 --> 00:35.657
I think one of the things that...

00:36.273 --> 00:39.408
...entrepreneurs forget the most or the most common problem I see...

00:39.847 --> 00:42.705
...is that their financial forecast is so off.

00:43.234 --> 00:47.249
And I mean off by a factor of 100 times and one year.

00:47.949 --> 00:52.128
A good rule of thumb is, you know, whatever an entrepreneur says is their financial plan,...

00:52.348 --> 00:55.563
...you add a year to that 'cause it's gonna be a year late and you divide it by 100.

00:56.149 --> 00:59.468
And, you know, prove me wrong, I'd like to see that.

00:59.561 --> 01:01.017
So the message here is that, you know, you've really gotta get out there.

01:01.622 --> 01:05.014
You've gotta get out there and ship.

01:05.678 --> 01:08.244
And sandbag your investors,..

01:08.680 --> 01:12.949
...do something that you're 90% confident you could actually achieve.

01:14.155 --> 01:19.006
Very seldom does an entrepreneur reach even their most conservative estimates.

01:19.131 --> 01:23.746
So I'm not saying I'm advocating sandbagging but I'm definitely...

01:24.185 --> 01:28.709
...advocating that you not promise 250 million dollars in year three,...

01:29.149 --> 01:30.246
...because that ain't gonna happen.
