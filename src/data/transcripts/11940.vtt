00:00.580 --> 00:06.990
On March 11th, Japan was hit by one of the biggest earthquakes the world has ever seen.

00:07.640 --> 00:11.070
The aftershocks and the devastating tsunami that followed...

00:11.330 --> 00:14.890
...have left over 28,000 people dead or missing...

00:15.220 --> 00:17.660
...and half a million people without homes.

00:18.170 --> 00:22.550
In the aftermath, some of Japan's nuclear reactors have experienced meltdowns.

00:22.700 --> 00:25.350
And the whole country is in danger of being exposed to radiation.

00:25.810 --> 00:30.410
Catastrophe of this magnitude almost seems like science fiction but it's not.

00:31.250 --> 00:32.740
It's real, it's very real.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.780
450,000 people are in shelters.

00:35.950 --> 00:38.130
And 1.5 million are without water.

00:38.670 --> 00:42.210
In the face of such adversity, we must unite to help one another.

00:42.770 --> 00:45.010
We must support and help those in need.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.130
Let us unite for Japan.

00:47.350 --> 00:50.570
So 100,000 children can go back to school.

00:50.890 --> 00:51.810
Unite for Japan.

00:52.030 --> 00:55.600
So they can rebuild their country, their community and their spirits.

00:55.900 --> 00:56.810
Unite for Japan.

00:57.260 --> 01:01.340
So that Japan knows that we are supporting them from around the world.

01:02.080 --> 01:04.750
As a global united front, we can make a difference.

01:05.090 --> 01:06.440

01:06.790 --> 01:07.740

01:08.050 --> 01:11.320
