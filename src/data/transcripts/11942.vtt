A lot of different countries have their own unique culture...

00:06.473 --> 00:08.326
...where people get together to wash.

00:08.830 --> 00:11.451
Korea is well known for its communal bathing culture,...

00:11.915 --> 00:14.287
...and if you don't mind being asked this question,...

00:14.752 --> 00:17.071
...could you tell me whether or not you have experienced...

00:17.157 --> 00:19.328
...Korean public bathhouses or saunas?

00:19.627 --> 00:21.212
It's okay, I have actually.

00:21.682 --> 00:24.375
At first, I had a hard time going into the place,...

00:25.021 --> 00:30.822
...but after all, I figure people get really close to each other once they go to public bathhouses together.

00:31.753 --> 00:33.289
How can I express my feelings,...

00:33.922 --> 00:37.093
...with your naked body, you show "nothing but the truth."

00:37.665 --> 00:41.841
In fact, there are many other countries that are famous for their bathing culture.

00:42.505 --> 00:44.358
Finland is the home of the sauna,...

00:44.775 --> 00:50.687
...a small room or house designed as a place to experience dry or wet heat sessions.

00:51.372 --> 00:56.312
And swimsuits, towels, or any other garments are rarely worn in the sauna.

00:56.865 --> 00:58.144
I've heard about that too.

00:58.811 --> 01:03.614
In addition, the Russians are definitely famous for their unique bathing culture...

01:04.030 --> 01:06.955
...and their traditional steam bath is called "Banya."

01:07.569 --> 01:10.653
In Russia, after the first good sweat is induced,...

01:10.987 --> 01:14.203
...it is customary to cool off in the breeze outdoors,...

01:14.602 --> 01:17.715
...or splash with cold water or in a lake or river.

01:18.625 --> 01:19.864
Doesn't that sound cold?

01:20.470 --> 01:25.231
Sometimes, I think going to public bathhouses is the ultimate treatment.

01:25.621 --> 01:29.983
You sweat out impurities and soak to soften the skin with a body scrub.
