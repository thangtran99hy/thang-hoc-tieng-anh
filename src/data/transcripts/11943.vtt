Did you know that Korea has the world's oldest international adoption program?

00:07.445 --> 00:09.922
Other encouraging news is that in recent years,...

00:10.290 --> 00:14.211
...the number of adopted children within the country has also been increasing.

00:14.753 --> 00:18.049
So the statistics are showing that more and more people...

00:18.123 --> 00:22.189
...are slowly but surely starting to realize the seriousness of adoption,...

00:22.663 --> 00:25.575
...and are taking action nationwide and worldwide.

00:26.049 --> 00:29.272
The other day, I went to visit an exhibition of photographs...

00:29.611 --> 00:34.144
...where many Korean celebrities have taken part in a series of charity photo shoots.

00:34.736 --> 00:38.626
The stars posed for pictures with orphans to help them find new parents.

00:38.965 --> 00:40.347
It was very heartwarming!

00:40.934 --> 00:46.001
I heard that nearly 10,000 babies are orphaned in Korea every year with no parents.

00:46.712 --> 00:50.155
But another hopeful sign is that, with the help of others,...

00:50.528 --> 00:53.215
...one third of them are adopted and find new homes.

00:53.719 --> 00:55.447
I heard some news about that too.

00:56.016 --> 00:59.663
The exhibition will hopefully raise people's concern for orphans...

01:00.074 --> 01:04.088
...and encourage them to help homeless children find homes and families...

01:04.453 --> 01:06.409
...and to eventually lead normal lives.

01:07.206 --> 01:11.214
Even by just looking at a photo of Angelina Jolie with her adopted kids...

01:11.880 --> 01:15.091
...don't you think that something like that encourages people...

01:15.333 --> 01:17.453
...and raises awareness about adoption?

01:18.303 --> 01:20.133
Despite all of the publicity and rumors,...

01:20.469 --> 01:23.075
...I think that Angelina is very nice and brave...

01:23.409 --> 01:26.212
...because she adopted children from developing countries.
