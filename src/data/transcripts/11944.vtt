00:02.760 --> 00:04.970
Every year, especially at the end of the year,...

00:05.040 --> 00:07.740
...we see several high - profile figures...

00:07.930 --> 00:09.630
...like billionaire Warren Buffett...

00:09.690 --> 00:12.080
...donating to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,...

00:12.510 --> 00:14.850
...and of course it is used to support charity.

00:15.450 --> 00:16.950
What I want to point out is that...

00:16.970 --> 00:18.390
...dollar amounts are important,...

00:18.730 --> 00:22.790
...but there is more to charitable giving than just the act of writing out checks.

00:23.320 --> 00:26.020
When we donate money to someone or something else,...

00:26.294 --> 00:28.140
...we are giving something of ourselves,...

00:28.250 --> 00:28.830
...don't you think?

00:29.500 --> 00:31.330
It is not an easy thing to do,...

00:31.560 --> 00:33.810
...giving away as much as you can possibly afford.

00:34.450 --> 00:37.970
We are making a statement about what is most important to us.

00:38.340 --> 00:40.670
This is not something to be taken lightly.

00:41.160 --> 00:42.980
It is a true sacrifice.

00:43.590 --> 00:46.210
You mentioned that you like doing charitable giving,...

00:46.260 --> 00:46.880
...am I correct?

00:48.000 --> 00:48.910
You are right.

00:49.270 --> 00:52.850
After spending about 5 years in a nonprofit organization,...

00:53.200 --> 00:56.550
...I realized that donating is not a casual activity,...

00:56.980 --> 00:58.020
...but when you do it,...

00:58.300 --> 00:59.890
...you can make it more meaningful.

01:00.400 --> 01:01.910
You should carefully plan,..

01:02.220 --> 01:04.920
...carefully target and carefully evaluate.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.700
Do you see what I'm getting at?

01:07.370 --> 01:09.260
Doing charity work is important,...

01:09.580 --> 01:12.160
...but giving effectively is more crucial.

01:12.680 --> 01:13.750
It requires love,...

01:14.110 --> 01:17.280
...but also requires deliberation and thoughtfulness.

01:17.890 --> 01:19.850
But a giving heart is not enough.

01:20.410 --> 01:22.480
We also need to use our heads when we give,...

01:22.810 --> 01:26.390
...seeking to maximize the effectiveness of the gifts we make.
