I Have No Clue!

00:03.097 --> 00:07.515
Why are people unaware that they use products from companies they hate all the time?

00:07.910 --> 00:12.621
For example, people who do not support tobacco companies use products from Philip Morris,...

00:12.966 --> 00:15.743
...including Oreos, Kraft cheese, Kool-aid, etc.

00:16.181 --> 00:17.427
The list goes on forever.

00:18.328 --> 00:22.181
Well, the only way to avoid those products would be to do some research.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.262
Don't take this the wrong way.

00:24.636 --> 00:26.873
There are people who do the necessary research.

00:27.268 --> 00:29.127
But most people don't bother doing it.

00:29.581 --> 00:34.877
They don't know that the products they use every day are owned by the same companies that they hate supporting.

00:35.528 --> 00:36.259
Think about it.

00:36.772 --> 00:39.339
It's hard to keep track of all the products on the market!

00:39.937 --> 00:45.096
Not everyone has the time to research and memorize exactly which company owns which brand,...

00:45.481 --> 00:50.108
...on top of trying to research and memorize which companies should be boycotted in the first place.

00:50.795 --> 00:54.993
Don't get me wrong, I'm not criticizing people who do that, like you, maybe.

00:55.621 --> 01:01.309
Anyway, it's sad but true that we end up using products from the very companies that we don't support.
