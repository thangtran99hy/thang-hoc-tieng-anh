00:03.020 --> 00:05.750
I thought about getting a car, but on second thought,...

00:05.850 --> 00:07.680
...maybe I should just save it...

00:07.710 --> 00:10.810
...until I see a decrease in the oil prices on the market.

00:11.360 --> 00:13.690
How much does oil cost per liter in Korea?

00:14.260 --> 00:16.450
If the price of crude oil keeps increasing,...

00:16.570 --> 00:19.270
...it will definitely bring an unstable economy,...

00:19.520 --> 00:21.580
...a growing gap between rich and poor,...

00:21.830 --> 00:23.650
...and conflict among nations.

00:24.200 --> 00:27.990
So, I'm suggesting that we should find alternative energy resources.

00:28.310 --> 00:32.050
You know, such as wind power, solar energy, wave energy...

00:32.160 --> 00:34.120
...or other alternate energy sources.

00:34.590 --> 00:35.930
What would be the best one,...

00:36.090 --> 00:38.070
...the one that sounds the most reasonable?

00:38.630 --> 00:40.940
You are definitely right about that.

00:41.160 --> 00:43.380
I see many ways we can save energy,...

00:43.590 --> 00:47.150
...reduce carbon dioxide emissions and prevent climate change.

00:47.690 --> 00:51.220
What you can do today to conserve energy is not so hard,...

00:52.110 --> 00:56.290
...and you can make a big difference and start saving energy now.

00:57.030 --> 00:59.990
Take public transportation, or ride a bicycle,...

01:00.230 --> 01:03.500
...ask people to turn off their engines while waiting in their car...

01:03.820 --> 01:05.830
...and remember to always turn off your lights...

01:05.910 --> 01:08.070
...and electronics when leaving a room.

01:08.610 --> 01:09.200
Right!

01:09.580 --> 01:12.050
Especially since consumer electronics...

01:12.130 --> 01:16.260
...play an increasingly larger role in your home's energy consumption.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.730
These actions don't sound so hard.

01:19.310 --> 01:22.750
The government should also encourage corporations and departments...

01:22.980 --> 01:27.520
...to come up with affordable and practical alternative energy resources.
