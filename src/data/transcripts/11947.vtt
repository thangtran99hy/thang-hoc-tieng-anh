00:00.050 --> 00:01.794
When you were a child, you were very musical.

00:01.950 --> 00:02.095
Yes.

00:02.231 --> 00:06.639
And you wanted to be in musicals, I mean, what was a dream that you had?

00:06.787 --> 00:08.030
I knew I was very musical.

00:08.114 --> 00:08.408
Yes.

00:08.505 --> 00:14.683
But it wasn't necessarily that I dreamed of having a music career until later in life.

00:15.315 --> 00:20.629
I knew that music was in my life and I knew that music was my greatest joy.

00:20.762 --> 00:21.106
Yeah.

00:21.639 --> 00:23.019
But I wasn't thinking about a job.

00:23.115 --> 00:24.614
I wasn't thinking about that kind of thing.

00:24.713 --> 00:29.482
So it wasn't until I was maybe 14 that I started to realize, "Oh my gosh!"

00:30.362 --> 00:32.613
"Wouldn't it be amazing if I could actually make a living..."

00:33.668 --> 00:35.187
"...doing what I love, making music."

00:35.845 --> 00:41.037
And so it kind of, it found itself in different ways.

00:41.161 --> 00:43.735
 I took acting, I loved theater, I loved the arts.

00:45.523 --> 00:48.094
I kept writing music, I did musical theater and opera.

00:49.385 --> 00:53.741
I just kinda did a lot of things and eventually it turned into kind of this last ten-year journey...

00:54.457 --> 00:59.809
...of what these CDs are and I can't believe that it actually came true.

01:00.691 --> 01:01.373
I see.

01:01.475 --> 01:06.960
Yeah, it sounds like... I mean, reading your biography, it sounds as if like...

01:07.322 --> 01:11.134
...it just happened rather than you actually planned in how to.

01:11.945 --> 01:12.720
It did just happen.

01:14.465 --> 01:15.417
There's always preparation.

01:16.242 --> 01:22.886
Luck is preparation meets opportunity.

01:23.045 --> 01:23.535
Yeah, definitely.

01:23.665 --> 01:29.164
And so, I think that in my preparation was that because I love music so much,...

01:29.233 --> 01:30.105
...I was constantly playing it.

01:30.589 --> 01:32.993
So, I was learning and I was taking voice lessons.

01:33.083 --> 01:34.132
I'm not self-taught vocally.

01:34.320 --> 01:34.462
Right.

01:37.015 --> 01:40.569
So, I was doing it for the sheer love of it and then the opportunity came.

01:41.259 --> 01:43.281
And the door was open and I had to walk through the door.

01:45.329 --> 01:48.707
But then, every day after that happened, it's been a wonderful learning experience.
