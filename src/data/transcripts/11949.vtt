Probably the single most important thing a leader has is trust of followers.

00:24.143 --> 00:26.583
Right? There's not a leader if there are no followers.

00:27.289 --> 00:29.787
And any follower takes a leap of faith...

00:30.707 --> 00:36.084
...in pretty much suspending your own judgment and trusting the judgment of somebody else.

00:37.019 --> 00:38.207
Trust is all you have.

00:38.709 --> 00:41.109
It's hard to build, it's easy to lose.

00:41.745 --> 00:47.226
And you know, in the era of new communications tools where you're constantly...

00:48.385 --> 00:52.261
...being exposed for good and for bad.

00:52.791 --> 00:56.519
I think the, probably the most important tool that a leader will have going forward is...

00:56.653 --> 00:59.227
...how to use all the tools at your disposal...

00:59.895 --> 01:02.931
...to build trust, to preserve trust and not to lose it.

01:03.815 --> 01:06.728
The most important skill that leaders of the future need...

01:07.459 --> 01:10.825
...is a clear sense of their calling, of their purpose.

01:11.723 --> 01:13.796
You see so many leaders that are technically confident,...

01:14.604 --> 01:17.813
...wonderfully skilled, either in technical knowledge...

01:17.897 --> 01:20.331
...and skills or whatever their trade or the craft is,...

01:20.902 --> 01:23.161
...we're just not sure in the service of what,...

01:23.461 --> 01:24.757
...why, the bigger questions.

01:25.207 --> 01:28.427
When we find this search in all of our students, we find it in executives...

01:28.854 --> 01:32.791
...all the way down through elementary school. I mean the search for meaning,...

01:33.001 --> 01:34.566
"Why am I doing what I'm doing?"

01:35.105 --> 01:39.139
So that clarity of purpose for me is the base,...

01:39.221 --> 01:41.287
...the bedrock of what leaders of the future need.
