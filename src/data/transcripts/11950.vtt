Last month, when I visited Taiwan for a business trip,...

00:05.460 --> 00:08.580
I went into this shop that sold music CDs,...

00:09.400 --> 00:11.200
...autographed goods, magazines and so on.

00:11.810 --> 00:13.880
Then I found items with "BoA",...

00:14.050 --> 00:16.450
..."Rain" and "Super Junior's" faces on them.

00:17.050 --> 00:17.560
I mean,...

00:17.870 --> 00:23.110
...I did see on TV that Korean popular culture is just sweeping across Asia,...

00:23.360 --> 00:26.090
...but after witnessing this with my own two eyes,...

00:26.590 --> 00:28.530
...I have to admit that Korea rocks.

00:29.260 --> 00:32.230
The trend has really given Korean stars fame...

00:32.400 --> 00:36.840
...and has done much to boost the image and prestige of Korean pop culture.

00:37.640 --> 00:40.730
But do you predict that this trend will last forever?

00:41.050 --> 00:43.380
Or is it just a temporary fad?

00:44.040 --> 00:47.850
What I know so far is that it's been around for a long time,...

00:48.020 --> 00:49.420
...longer than I thought;...

00:49.660 --> 00:52.480
...so it will be around for another 10 years or so.

00:52.920 --> 00:56.360
I was actually surprised to hear that even in North America,...

00:56.790 --> 00:59.590
...Korean movies are showing at regular theaters.

01:00.690 --> 01:01.590
In doing so,...

01:02.000 --> 01:06.070
...Korean contemporary culture does not only pass along Korean culture,...

01:06.410 --> 01:09.970
...but also paves the way for many other Korean businesses abroad.

01:10.590 --> 01:12.780
Recently, I heard that in India,...

01:12.980 --> 01:16.480
...Korean TV dramas and soap operas are a big hit.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.140
The government, I think,...

01:18.420 --> 01:21.510
...should encourage more exporting of Korean pop culture,...

01:21.810 --> 01:23.920
...and promote it on a regular basis.

01:24.260 --> 01:26.720
Certainly, I admit Korean pop culture...

01:27.170 --> 01:29.820
... has great value as a cultural asset in Korea.

01:30.390 --> 01:34.530
Promoting Korean pop culture with various media tools is very important, too.

01:34.950 --> 01:37.550
I hope it can spread all over the world...

01:37.650 --> 01:39.160
...not just in Asia, you know.

01:39.900 --> 01:44.000
I'm also expecting more Korean pop artists to make it in the world!
