When I was a little kid, I spent most of my days playing with robot toys,...

00:08.220 --> 00:10.930
...or watching TV shows like "Transformers"...

00:11.250 --> 00:14.870
...where a war re - erupts between two robotic clans,...

00:15.190 --> 00:17.430
...the heroic ones and the evil robots.

00:18.050 --> 00:22.190
Anyhow, my childhood dream was to become an engineer who invents,...

00:22.350 --> 00:24.520
...develops and controls robots.

00:25.120 --> 00:25.930
As a child,...

00:26.140 --> 00:31.010
...I wanted to make a robot that would do my homework and go to class instead of me.

00:31.320 --> 00:34.670
Then you should visit a robot theme park here in Korea.

00:35.230 --> 00:37.080
The government announced that it will build...

00:37.160 --> 00:39.840
...two robot theme parks as part of an effort...

00:39.900 --> 00:42.450
...to boost the country's robotics industry.

00:42.990 --> 00:44.010
Can you imagine?

00:44.510 --> 00:48.410
Those two places will be meccas for the country's robot industry.

00:48.850 --> 00:51.060
They will include amusement park areas,...

00:51.230 --> 00:53.340
...exhibition halls and stadiums...

00:53.690 --> 00:56.420
...where robots can compete in various events.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.560
But you know what I really hope?

00:58.890 --> 01:02.710
I do hope that those robots just stay at exhibition places...

01:03.060 --> 01:05.460
...and not end up out in the real world.

01:05.990 --> 01:08.300
Maybe I watched too many movies that show...

01:08.380 --> 01:11.460
...unpleasant consequences after developing robots.

01:11.860 --> 01:14.700
But I predict that those artificial intelligences...

01:14.850 --> 01:17.240
...will become so human - like in the near future,...

01:17.570 --> 01:19.950
...that who knows, maybe one day,...

01:20.120 --> 01:21.850
...robots might have emotions,...

01:21.910 --> 01:24.940
...you know, feel love, jealousy and hatred.

01:25.400 --> 01:26.780
Do you predict so?

01:27.270 --> 01:29.720
My opinion is somewhat different from yours.

01:30.130 --> 01:35.420
I don't think the robots actually feel emotions like love, joy, and sadness.

01:35.820 --> 01:39.570
Even though technology has been developing quickly,...

01:39.720 --> 01:44.230
...it will not be able to make a system to feel emotions like human beings!

01:44.670 --> 01:45.320
As you know,...

01:45.640 --> 01:49.950
...robots are just moved by a system made by human beings.
