How Dreams Work.

00:03.150 --> 00:05.310
Our dreams combine verbal, visual,...

00:05.490 --> 00:10.070
...and emotional stimuli into a nonsensical but entertaining story line.

00:10.530 --> 00:13.450
We can sometimes even solve problems in our sleep.

00:14.060 --> 00:18.420
Many experts disagree on exactly what the purpose of our dreams might be.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.120
Are they strictly random brain impulses,...

00:21.370 --> 00:25.790
...or are our brains actually working through issues from our daily life while we sleep?

00:26.340 --> 00:28.290
Should we even interrupt our dreams?

00:28.970 --> 00:31.730
Do you guarantee that dreams are worth thinking about?

00:32.170 --> 00:35.000
Many say, "Are you serious? Of course!"...

00:35.330 --> 00:38.340
...and add that we have a great deal to learn from our dreams.

00:38.810 --> 00:39.820
For example,...

00:40.000 --> 00:45.840
...Sigmund Freud said that our dreams represent the desires that we are unable to express in a social setting.

00:46.400 --> 00:48.850
Dreams ensure that the unconscious mind...

00:49.010 --> 00:51.980
...acts out those unacceptable thoughts and desires.

00:52.440 --> 00:55.140
More recently, around 1973,...

00:55.150 --> 00:57.530
...a researcher named Allan Hobson said...

00:57.810 --> 01:01.980
...that dreams were simply the result of random electrical brain impulses that pulled...

01:02.100 --> 01:05.360
...imagery from traces of experience stored in the memory.
