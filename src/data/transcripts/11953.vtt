Happiness Is What We Make It To Be.

00:04.012 --> 00:08.151
We all talk of marriage and the birth of our children as a major "life moment".

00:08.489 --> 00:12.453
Nothing personal, but as a single person, where do you get that kind of joy?

00:12.911 --> 00:16.741
Do you have a "life lesson" that has changed you or your life, good or bad?

00:17.346 --> 00:19.657
The best lesson that I've got so far is that...

00:20.051 --> 00:23.205
...life is short and we should enjoy our life as much as possible!

00:23.886 --> 00:28.223
No offense to married women like you, who spend most of their time taking care of the family.

00:28.909 --> 00:34.211
But what I'm saying is that we don't even have enough time on this planet to be, for example, stressed out!

00:35.071 --> 00:37.259
Hate is also a wasted time spent...

00:37.807 --> 00:39.619
...and no vengeance is justified.

00:40.133 --> 00:40.885
Love is everything,...

00:41.368 --> 00:45.517
...whether it is love for a sister, mom, dad, husband, children, or friends.

00:46.110 --> 00:49.105
Laughing is better than yelling at someone, or crying in sorrow.

00:49.749 --> 00:53.274
We should also be grateful for our health and that we are not in pain.

00:53.788 --> 00:56.810
For every breath we take is a blessing if it is not in pain.

00:57.422 --> 00:59.457
Look on the bright side of every negative thought...

00:59.883 --> 01:03.285
...and we will have the answer to the question, "Why should I be grateful?"

01:03.672 --> 01:07.840
The answer is, "Because no matter how bad it is, it could be worse."
