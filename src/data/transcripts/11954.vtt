I Am Honest to God!

00:03.663 --> 00:09.593
You know when you leave a store the theft alarm goes off because the sensor mistakenly trips as you walk out?

00:10.201 --> 00:11.372
It's happened to everyone,...

00:11.671 --> 00:13.755
...so I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

00:14.329 --> 00:16.555
Well, it happened to me just an hour ago,...

00:17.013 --> 00:20.750
...only this time, I actually did have something on me that I had not paid for.

00:21.300 --> 00:22.842
It was all a silly mistake,...

00:23.228 --> 00:27.232
...but the store's security guard demanded an answer from me over and over again...

00:27.553 --> 00:29.093
...and did not believe me at all.

00:29.689 --> 00:31.495
It certainly looked suspicious.

00:31.925 --> 00:34.915
I had a paperback book in my back pocket under my shirt...

00:35.233 --> 00:37.779
...which I was wearing untucked and over my pants.

00:38.433 --> 00:41.048
I told the security man the honest-to-God truth:...

00:41.583 --> 00:44.412
...I normally carry my paperbacks in my back pocket,...

00:44.817 --> 00:49.920
...so when I decided to buy that book, I naturally stuck it there as I continued to browse.

00:50.669 --> 00:54.421
When my cell phone rang, forgetting that I had a book in my back pocket,...

00:54.761 --> 00:57.185
...I simply walked outside to answer the phone.

00:57.831 --> 01:02.389
That's when the alarm went off, and that's when the security guard came out to see why.

01:03.077 --> 01:05.733
I took the book out of my back pocket when he walked up,...

01:06.081 --> 01:08.250
...and said that I had forgotten that it was there.

01:08.907 --> 01:13.343
He took me back to a small room where he has been interrogating me about the book.

01:13.989 --> 01:17.383
I don't know how he's going to justify his harsh treatment of me later.
