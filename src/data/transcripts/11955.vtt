Are Cell Phones Safe?

00:03.248 --> 00:04.602
I do not have a house phone.

00:04.898 --> 00:06.299
Instead, I use a cell phone.

00:06.847 --> 00:09.391
My question is, how safe are cell phones?

00:09.723 --> 00:12.206
I heard that cell phones can make a man infertile.

00:12.959 --> 00:14.810
If they can do that, what else can they do?

00:15.123 --> 00:17.229
Come on, I deserve an explanation.

00:17.813 --> 00:20.820
You work for a cell phone company, so you must know something.

00:21.269 --> 00:24.272
Explain to me how it works and stuff please, Lynn!

00:25.022 --> 00:27.681
Well, just by their basic operation,...

00:27.995 --> 00:31.719
...cell phones emit a small amount of electromagnetic radiation.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.151
There's a lot of talk in the news these days...

00:34.253 --> 00:38.895
...about whether or not cell phones emit enough radiation to cause adverse health effects.

00:39.498 --> 00:44.696
The concern is that cell phones are often placed close to or against the head during use,...

00:45.255 --> 00:48.710
...which puts the radiation in direct contact with the tissues in the head.

00:49.567 --> 00:55.694
In this position, there is a good chance that some of the radiation will be absorbed by human tissue.

00:56.340 --> 00:59.817
If you are worried about the potential hazards of cell phone radiation,...

01:00.253 --> 01:02.075
...there are some ways to reduce your risk,...

01:02.448 --> 01:05.499
...such as using a hands-free headset, among others.
