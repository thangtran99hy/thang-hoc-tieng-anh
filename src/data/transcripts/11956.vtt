Nobody knows for sure what the original purpose of Stonehenge was.

00:07.758 --> 00:09.695
Although there is no way to prove its purpose,...

00:10.038 --> 00:12.183
...there is evidence of cremations on the site,...

00:12.621 --> 00:16.525
...indicating at one point Stonehenge was used as a funeral site.

00:17.151 --> 00:22.915
The generally accepted theory though, is that Stonehenge was originally used as an astronomical calendar.

00:23.609 --> 00:28.836
The real mystery of Stonehenge, however, is not what it was used for, but how it was built.

00:29.475 --> 00:31.167
Three types of stones are found there.

00:31.420 --> 00:36.009
The first type has been traced to a location 13 kilometers northwest of the site.

00:36.615 --> 00:41.274
The second and third types were 40 and 250 kilometers away, respectively.

00:41.779 --> 00:44.787
Leading scientists and mechanical engineers cannot figure out...

00:45.177 --> 00:49.758
...how people with no knowledge of the wheel could move these huge stones to the site.

00:50.504 --> 00:53.937
If you were to propose this as a theoretical problem to a scientist,...

00:54.432 --> 00:58.228
...he's likely to say, "No way" or "You've got to be kidding me".

00:59.325 --> 01:01.440
Then just mention the word, "Stonehenge".

01:01.689 --> 01:05.611
The scientist, if he knows anything about history, will nod his head at this,...

01:05.852 --> 01:10.930
...for Stonehenge is an ancient feat of engineering that still confounds the greatest minds.

01:11.479 --> 01:15.581
I'm sure that it will continue to stump scientists for centuries more.
