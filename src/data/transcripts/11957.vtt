My name is Gretchen Rubin and this is the Happiness Project.

00:06.640 --> 00:10.760
The resolution for this week is to reevaluate your mantras.

00:11.250 --> 00:14.570
We all have mantras that go through our head often many times a day.

00:14.950 --> 00:18.380
And you think about them without really even reflecting on the fact...

00:18.520 --> 00:21.970
...that you're thinking about them. And yet they can have an enormous influence on the way that you act...

00:22.070 --> 00:22.970
...and the way that you think.

00:23.280 --> 00:27.520
So, for example, a mantra might be, "I have no self-control"...

00:27.990 --> 00:31.420
...or "I'm so disorganized". And it goes through your head over and over.

00:31.650 --> 00:35.370
And so by getting control of those mantras you can do a better job of taking control...

00:35.530 --> 00:36.650
...of the way that you're thinking and acting.

00:37.040 --> 00:40.950
And I realized it for myself. A mantra that went through my head many many times a day was,...

00:41.280 --> 00:42.650
..."I'm so busy, I don't have time for that".

00:42.980 --> 00:44.930
And I'd be going through my day and I'd be chatting with a friend...

00:45.070 --> 00:48.760
...or I'd be reading some article that I was interested in but that had nothing to do with anything.

00:49.130 --> 00:50.790
And I think, "Oh, I'm so busy I don't have time for that".

00:51.350 --> 00:53.390
And then I realized, "That's not true".

00:54.090 --> 00:56.390
I've changed my mantra. Now, my mantra is,...

00:56.660 --> 01:00.080
..."I have plenty of time for the things that are important to me".

01:00.560 --> 01:03.200
Because I realized that my mantra was making me feel harried.

01:03.310 --> 01:05.380
It was making me feel like there's all these things that I wanted to do...

01:05.490 --> 01:08.210
...that I didn't have time for, that I would have done if I could.

01:08.560 --> 01:13.450
And just feeling pressed and just like there is this relentless pressure.

01:14.210 --> 01:17.280
Now, when I say, "I have plenty of time for the things that are important to me",...

01:17.530 --> 01:19.980
...it focuses my attention on figuring out what my priorities are.

01:20.450 --> 01:24.300
If it's important to me, I have time for it. But I have to be honest about what's important to me.

01:24.750 --> 01:28.100
That's the thing. You have plenty of time for the things that are important to you.

01:28.250 --> 01:30.200
But just be honest about what's really important to you.

01:30.970 --> 01:35.660
So, the resolution for this week is to reevaluate your mantras.

01:36.120 --> 01:38.100
And the thought for this week comes from Thoreau,...

01:38.540 --> 01:42.310
...who said, "I love a broad margin to my life."
