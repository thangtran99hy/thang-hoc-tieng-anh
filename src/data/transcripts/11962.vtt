00:02.853 --> 00:05.367
It's on me. I will take care of it Alex.

00:05.685 --> 00:08.249
Wait up! What are you doing? Let's go Dutch.

00:08.728 --> 00:10.239
No, it's my treat now.

00:10.989 --> 00:14.015
What is the origin of going Dutch or Dutch pay, anyhow?

00:14.741 --> 00:19.587
I heard that people in Holland tend to be very stingy, like Scrooge, in the book...

00:19.862 --> 00:20.692
..."A Christmas Carol".

00:21.250 --> 00:24.049
So if you go to a restaurant or pub with Dutch people,...

00:24.403 --> 00:27.107
...they tend to pay for only their own portions.

00:27.625 --> 00:29.646
I know it sounds very mythological,...

00:30.118 --> 00:33.842
...but I'm wondering if the word really exists to describe such a person.

00:34.387 --> 00:37.771
Anyhow, back to my point, since I'm used to Korean culture,..

00:38.123 --> 00:42.513
... I don't quite understand why Westerners tend to pay for their portion only.

00:42.981 --> 00:44.769
Even at someone's birthday party!

00:45.409 --> 00:48.489
Once, I was invited to my Canadian friend's birthday party,...

00:48.827 --> 00:51.213
...and after we had a nice, fancy dinner,...

00:51.563 --> 00:53.701
...each of us had to pay for our own share.

00:54.223 --> 00:56.529
I mean, in Korea, on such an occasion,...

00:56.889 --> 00:58.461
...the birthday girl or boy,...

00:58.665 --> 01:01.539
...usually buys drinks or whatever for the whole group...

01:01.989 --> 01:04.622
...and in return gets nice birthday presents!

01:05.046 --> 01:05.833
I see.

01:06.141 --> 01:08.824
As far as I know, after that first round...

01:09.233 --> 01:12.021
...the next person goes to the bar and buys another round, right?

01:12.858 --> 01:15.163
Well, we do say "Let's go Dutch" often.

01:15.770 --> 01:19.575
Obviously, it doesn't mean, "Let's take a plane and go to the Netherlands,"...

01:19.927 --> 01:23.563
...it means we'll go out together but each person will pay his own share.

01:24.115 --> 01:25.753
It's also called "Dutch treat."

01:26.538 --> 01:29.480
I like this sort of system, since there are no obligations.

01:30.061 --> 01:33.107
I don't like to feel as though just because someone spent...

01:33.279 --> 01:34.995
...30 bucks on me at dinner tonight...

01:35.415 --> 01:36.546
...that I will have to remember...

01:36.619 --> 01:40.289
...to spend exactly 30 dollars on that person the next time we meet.
