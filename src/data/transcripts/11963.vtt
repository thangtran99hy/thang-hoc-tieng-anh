How Can We End Poverty?

00:03.967 --> 00:06.199
Whenever I talk about microcredit,...

00:06.523 --> 00:09.598
...people say things like, "I'm sorry, could you repeat that?"

00:09.737 --> 00:11.939
...or "Could you run that by me again?"

00:12.992 --> 00:14.921
I guess not many people have heard of it.

00:15.488 --> 00:19.792
Microcredit is a great way to help poor people lift themselves out of poverty.

00:20.639 --> 00:25.002
It is a system that offers loans under 200 dollars without collateral...

00:25.391 --> 00:28.615
...and has changed the lives of millions of people worldwide.

00:29.770 --> 00:33.311
About 50% of the world population lives under poverty...

00:33.628 --> 00:36.279
...and struggles to survive on a daily basis.

00:37.085 --> 00:42.049
But there can be so many creative ways that you can make a difference in the lives of the poor.

00:42.990 --> 00:45.707
What can you do to help create a poverty - free world?

00:46.207 --> 00:47.105
Any ideas?

00:47.623 --> 00:52.145
I think many of the problems of the developing nations have to do with infrastructure.

00:52.422 --> 00:57.765
If there are no roads, food, medicine and other needed goods and services cannot reach the people.

00:58.577 --> 01:01.933
At some point, it is the responsibility of a good government...

01:02.000 --> 01:07.601
...to employ people to build roads and water purification systems and other necessary facilities.
