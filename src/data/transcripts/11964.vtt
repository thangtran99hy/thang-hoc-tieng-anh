Ad Slogans.

00:03.409 --> 00:08.643
How many times have you been in your car with your radio on, gotten out, and hours later,...

00:08.925 --> 00:10.730
...had some jingle playing in your head?

00:11.476 --> 00:12.961
This, is good advertising.

00:13.647 --> 00:18.870
That jingle was so catchy that hours after you had been exposed to it, it still lingered.

00:19.510 --> 00:21.341
You might find yourself humming the tune,...

00:21.642 --> 00:23.151
...and people might say, "Sorry?"...

00:23.547 --> 00:24.880
...or "Did you say something?"

00:25.840 --> 00:27.948
...the same can be said of ad slogans.

00:28.594 --> 00:34.489
Every day, we are surrounded by car ads, credit card ads, travel ads, food ads, clothing ads,...

00:34.806 --> 00:35.765
...the list goes on.

00:36.441 --> 00:38.788
The purpose of the slogan in an advertisement...

00:39.134 --> 00:42.031
...is to leave the key brand message in the mind of the target.

00:42.396 --> 00:43.180
That's us.

00:43.878 --> 00:45.120
Its goal is to stick:...

00:45.621 --> 00:48.489
"If you get nothing else from this ad, get this...!"

00:49.048 --> 00:53.859
We don't find ourselves asking "I'm sorry could you be more specific about the product?"...

00:54.318 --> 00:56.813
...or "Could you tell me about this in more detail?"

00:57.281 --> 01:00.595
No! We just want whatever was shown to us in the ad!

01:01.276 --> 01:05.487
In the United States, omitting words such as 'the' and 'and',...

01:05.928 --> 01:11.377
...the five most frequently used words in slogans are 'you' (11.15%),...

01:11.893 --> 01:14.288
...'your' (7.94%),...

01:14.875 --> 01:17.357
...'we' (6.03%),...

01:17.805 --> 01:20.080
...'world' (4.18%)...

01:20.409 --> 01:24.931
...and 'best' (2.67%), according to AD Slogans.
