Secondhand Smoke - A Major Health Hazard.

00:04.833 --> 00:07.525
Winston, would you please put out that cigarette?

00:07.748 --> 00:09.039
I hate cigarette smoke!

00:09.485 --> 00:13.296
Besides, I'm sure you know how hazardous secondhand smoke is.

00:13.805 --> 00:16.823
If you care about me, please stop smoking while I'm around.

00:17.171 --> 00:20.358
Or, better yet, I think you should quit smoking cold turkey!

00:20.753 --> 00:22.727
You know I'm saying this for your own good.

00:23.613 --> 00:24.562
I see what you mean,...

00:24.940 --> 00:26.952
...but it's really hard for me to quit smoking now!

00:27.391 --> 00:28.944
I'm under a lot of stress these days...

00:29.353 --> 00:31.810
...and smoking is the only way to release the stress.

00:32.277 --> 00:35.385
I know I'm pathetic, but you're going to have to bear with me.

00:36.105 --> 00:38.514
About secondhand smoke, I see your point, Jaime,...

00:38.904 --> 00:41.831
...that it affects your health as much as it damages my health.

00:42.387 --> 00:44.505
But, as for me, I have to protest.

00:45.083 --> 00:48.103
Do you want me to go outside the building whenever I need a cigarette break?

00:48.570 --> 00:51.439
Then I'm going to have to leave my computer every half an hour.

00:51.791 --> 00:52.709
That's not productive!

00:53.169 --> 00:55.287
Plus, smoking helps me focus better.

00:55.606 --> 00:58.962
So, I suggest that you move your desk to another room for now!
