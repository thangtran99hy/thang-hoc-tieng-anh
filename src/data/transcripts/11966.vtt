00:00.579 --> 00:02.617
The Definition of Gossiping.

00:03.907 --> 00:06.621
Gossiping appears to be part of human nature.

00:07.164 --> 00:11.293
There are sociologists, linguists, psychologists, and historians...

00:11.398 --> 00:14.915
...who actually research gossip and how it functions in society.

00:15.588 --> 00:17.651
It's a tricky phenomenon to study, though.

00:18.221 --> 00:21.265
People usually gossip spontaneously and in private,...

00:21.739 --> 00:26.784
...so it's undisputable that it's almost impossible to study gossip in a laboratory setting.

00:27.681 --> 00:32.337
In fact, many researchers study gossip by eavesdropping on gossipers.

00:33.654 --> 00:37.795
When researchers study gossip, they don't all use the same definition.

00:38.470 --> 00:40.550
Most start with the same basic idea:...

00:41.129 --> 00:46.687
...gossip is a conversation between two people that concerns a third person who is not present.

00:47.467 --> 00:50.473
Different researchers then add a range of stipulations,...

00:50.917 --> 00:53.089
...even if others might not agree with them.

00:53.610 --> 00:59.891
For example, one addition would be that the people talking are transmitting information as though it was fact,...

01:00.309 --> 01:03.248
...but they have not confirmed the information as factual.

01:04.086 --> 01:07.317
As far as I'm concerned, regardless of how you define it,...

01:07.678 --> 01:10.205
...gossip is wrong whether fact or fiction!
