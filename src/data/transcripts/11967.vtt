Throughout my entire life,..

00:04.820 --> 00:08.340
...I didn't see having a mentor as something that could play such a...

00:08.570 --> 00:11.510
...crucial part in our lives until recent years.

00:11.990 --> 00:15.150
When people are struggling in their personal life or their career,...

00:15.470 --> 00:19.320
...it helps to be able to turn to someone whom you admire and trust.

00:19.860 --> 00:22.320
Let me think about another way to explain this,...

00:22.490 --> 00:25.770
...like someone who has already traveled down the road you're traveling,...

00:26.070 --> 00:27.870
...and has done so successfully.

00:28.340 --> 00:32.020
I previously thought that having a mentor means you're a failure...

00:32.270 --> 00:33.870
...or makes you a lesser person.

00:34.270 --> 00:37.400
But even a person like Bill Gates has a role model.

00:37.710 --> 00:40.830
So I guess it makes you a smarter, better person.

00:41.290 --> 00:42.670
I do have a role model,...

00:42.970 --> 00:47.160
...but I can't personally contact them or get face-to-face advice.

00:47.260 --> 00:50.380
Right now, I need a mentor who can give me realistic,...

00:50.480 --> 00:52.690
...practical and encouraging advice.

00:52.960 --> 00:53.950
But let's say that...

00:54.090 --> 00:58.620
...for some reason my role model refuses or is unavailable to mentor me?

00:58.950 --> 01:02.040
Hopefully it won't happen to you, but even if it does happen,...

01:02.360 --> 01:03.960
...don't take it personally.

01:04.190 --> 01:07.470
Not everyone wants or has the time to be a mentor.

01:07.890 --> 01:11.330
Also, if someone asked me to be his or her mentor,...

01:11.450 --> 01:16.040
...I would question whether or not I am successful enough to even be a mentor.

01:16.550 --> 01:17.220
Anyways,...

01:17.430 --> 01:21.680
...I think you can still learn from this individual by reading his or her books,...

01:22.020 --> 01:25.620
...listening to his or her tapes and by watching his or her videos.

01:26.020 --> 01:27.690
If you do that constantly,...

01:27.860 --> 01:31.860
...you'll actually find yourself starting to think like this individual.
