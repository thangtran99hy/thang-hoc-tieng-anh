00:03.272 --> 00:05.589
Mi-na, can you do me a big favor?

00:06.465 --> 00:07.613
Can I borrow some money?

00:08.011 --> 00:11.605
I have to pay off my credit card by next week, and I don't have enough to do that.

00:12.188 --> 00:15.059
At this rate, I will soon become a credit delinquent.

00:15.730 --> 00:19.766
I heard when a recruiting agency or a big - named company tries to hire you,...

00:20.163 --> 00:23.912
...they look up your credit history and decide whether to hire you or not.

00:24.597 --> 00:27.393
This is my first time sitting on such debt.

00:27.843 --> 00:29.766
Could you help me out please?

00:30.399 --> 00:32.298
How much do you owe the credit company?

00:32.875 --> 00:34.331
Where did you spend all the money?

00:34.763 --> 00:35.597
Let me have it.

00:36.061 --> 00:38.252
You should at least make a minimum payment.

00:38.779 --> 00:41.589
I also heard about an employer checking your bank account.

00:42.107 --> 00:43.735
You should be careful about that.

00:44.195 --> 00:46.329
I think it's more serious than we think.

00:46.896 --> 00:49.311
As consumer spending is holding steady,...

00:50.206 --> 00:54.317
...we see the rising level of debt people are putting on credit cards,...

00:54.727 --> 00:58.496
...and quite a few of them are concerned about being able to pay it off.

00:59.253 --> 01:01.802
As more consumers fall behind on credit payments,...

01:02.249 --> 01:07.249
...there are increasing activities of so-called debt counselors or debt settlement services.

01:08.256 --> 01:12.317
Anyways, I guess there should be new laws regarding debt settlement,...

01:12.702 --> 01:14.669
...relieving debts of credit delinquents.

01:14.968 --> 01:15.847
That's a good idea.

01:16.263 --> 01:18.787
We should not just wait for them to pay back their debts,...

01:19.186 --> 01:21.611
...but need to find some ways to solve this problem.

01:22.347 --> 01:27.506
But the problem is, still, there are some debates going on to decide whether to help them or not.

01:28.138 --> 01:31.901
The problem of credit delinquency is getting serious in many countries.

01:32.402 --> 01:34.481
It is one of the big social issues.
