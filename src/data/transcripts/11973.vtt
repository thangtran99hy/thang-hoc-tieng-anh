What do you think of men wearing makeup? Are you dressed up often?

00:07.600 --> 00:10.890
How much time and money do you spend to dress yourself up?

00:11.070 --> 00:12.730
Well, to be honest with you,...

00:12.870 --> 00:14.510
...when I first came to Korea,...

00:14.560 --> 00:18.320
...and saw posters and pictures of men advertising cosmetics,...

00:18.690 --> 00:20.170
...I thought they had to be gay.

00:20.730 --> 00:24.760
But now I know the term "metrosexual" generally applies to...

00:24.930 --> 00:28.370
...heterosexual men with a strong concern for their appearance.

00:28.790 --> 00:30.780
So, as far as I can see,...

00:30.850 --> 00:34.230
...metrosexual men are usually single, young guys...

00:34.430 --> 00:36.370
...with a high disposable income,...

00:36.460 --> 00:38.320
...living or working in the city.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.440
Like most young women,...

00:40.610 --> 00:44.380
...metrosexual men deck themselves out in the nicest clothes.

00:44.890 --> 00:47.880
Let me think of an example here. Ah!

00:48.020 --> 00:51.470
The world famous soccer star David Beckham could be one of them.

00:51.930 --> 00:55.490
He is not only an accomplished star athlete on the field,...

00:55.700 --> 00:58.870
...but also is well-known for both immaculate grooming...

00:59.070 --> 01:02.830
...and a tendency toward nontraditional male clothing.

01:03.410 --> 01:04.660
Back to your question,...

01:04.800 --> 01:09.660
...I spend about 15 minutes to smarten myself up, and less ...

01:09.730 --> 01:13.840
...than 100 thousand won per month on buying clothes and other accessories.

01:14.360 --> 01:17.410
Well, what do you think of those metrosexual men?

01:17.770 --> 01:20.070
Well, I think it's a very good trend.

01:20.440 --> 01:23.650
I love guys having a lot of interest in their appearance.

01:24.080 --> 01:26.870
They are far better than "retrosexual" men,...
