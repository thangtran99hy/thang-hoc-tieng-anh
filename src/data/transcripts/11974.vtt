00:02.730 --> 00:07.440
I saw an image of astronauts having a training session inside a spacecraft,...

00:07.820 --> 00:09.610
...and it looked like so much fun.

00:09.870 --> 00:11.930
I know that looks like fun,...

00:12.220 --> 00:14.180
...but the astronaut training program is...

00:14.380 --> 00:17.980
...preliminary to formal space transportation systems,...

00:18.290 --> 00:20.190
...and is tougher than you could imagine.

00:20.740 --> 00:23.660
It's not like you can just hop in a spaceship.

00:23.910 --> 00:28.250
You need to do academic study which includes classes in shuttle systems,...

00:28.550 --> 00:30.530
...in basic science and technology,...

00:30.620 --> 00:33.400
...like mathematics, geology, astronomy,...

00:33.590 --> 00:36.470
...physics and materials processing, and so on.

00:36.820 --> 00:37.690
On top of that,...

00:37.890 --> 00:40.840
...they also have to receive training in scuba diving,...

00:40.980 --> 00:43.510
...space suits, and parachute jumping...

00:43.670 --> 00:46.910
...as well as land and sea survival training.

00:47.240 --> 00:49.680
Why do they need all those training sessions?

00:50.100 --> 00:51.950
That doesn't sound relevant to me.

00:52.310 --> 00:53.950
They need to learn how to deal with...

00:54.050 --> 00:58.060
...emergencies associated with high and low atmospheric pressures...

00:58.230 --> 00:59.660
...in the altitude chambers.

01:00.050 --> 01:01.450
Nothing great is easy.

01:02.030 --> 01:05.170
Let's say you passed all these training courses,..

01:05.380 --> 01:07.370
...and ready for the space travel,...

01:07.720 --> 01:10.940
...where would you want to go and what would you want to do in space?

01:11.420 --> 01:13.980
Well, I would first visit Mars...

01:14.100 --> 01:18.390
...where recent discovery says there's evidence that Mars had water on...

01:18.470 --> 01:21.550
...or near its surface at some point in its past.

01:21.870 --> 01:23.860
And it may sound unrealistic,...

01:24.330 --> 01:26.120
...but I'd want to walk on the Moon!
