When did you start learning Korean?

00:05.340 --> 00:08.440
What was the most difficult thing you faced while learning?

00:08.580 --> 00:09.780
It's a long story.

00:10.080 --> 00:12.580
One of my best friends at high school was Korean,...

00:12.610 --> 00:14.390
...and he taught me some Korean words,...

00:14.440 --> 00:16.220
...which I found quite interesting.

00:16.860 --> 00:18.480
After graduating from high school,...

00:18.570 --> 00:21.750
...I decided to take a Korean language course at my college,...

00:21.850 --> 00:23.660
...and I learned it in earnest.

00:24.100 --> 00:27.590
Well, I actually tried to learn other Asian languages,..

00:27.730 --> 00:29.260
...like Chinese and Japanese,...

00:29.530 --> 00:32.800
...but I found Chinese characters too complicated.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.800
And I don't know what happened with Japanese but,...

00:36.110 --> 00:39.640
...at some point, I just lost interest in the Japanese language;...

00:39.950 --> 00:43.410
...maybe too many foreigners already speak Japanese, that's why.

00:44.070 --> 00:46.550
Oh, I remember one of my classmates said...

00:46.650 --> 00:50.980
...he thought Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters looked the same.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.390
Well, I partially agree with him, because...

00:54.500 --> 00:58.260
...those Chinese characters look almost the same as the Japanese ones.

00:58.480 --> 01:02.960
But Korean letters don't have any resemblance to other Asian languages.

01:03.380 --> 01:07.330
True. In my case, I attempted to learn French once,...

01:07.460 --> 01:10.720
...since speaking French sounds and looks so noble,...

01:11.000 --> 01:12.600
...but couldn't keep it up.

01:12.800 --> 01:16.610
The main reason was that I didn't have a strong connection with French.

01:17.050 --> 01:18.910
I didn't know anyone from France,...

01:19.060 --> 01:21.710
...didn't really have an interest in French culture.

01:22.290 --> 01:26.820
When learning a language you really need to have a great interest in that culture as well.
