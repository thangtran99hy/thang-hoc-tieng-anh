00:02.775 --> 00:05.679
Have you thought about what you will be like after 10 years?

00:06.151 --> 00:07.565
Let me picture that for you,...

00:08.003 --> 00:10.593
...I guess you will have a professional career,...

00:11.020 --> 00:13.068
...and will be getting ready to get married.

00:13.525 --> 00:14.195
What do you think?

00:14.675 --> 00:15.775
Correct me, if I'm wrong,...

00:15.917 --> 00:20.880
...I guess this is the time to think about what you will do to make your dreams come true.

00:21.703 --> 00:24.523
In my case, I had prepared before I graduated,...

00:24.847 --> 00:27.919
...so, by the time I graduated, I already had a job.

00:28.688 --> 00:31.019
I've been in this industry since then,...

00:31.425 --> 00:35.413
...so after 10 years, I guess I will be in a different field making my living.

00:36.133 --> 00:39.613
Also, I will have a happy family with two kids.

00:39.956 --> 00:44.562
I wish, after 10 years, to have a professional and steady career.

00:45.039 --> 00:48.236
I plan to get married after turning 35, or later,...

00:48.589 --> 00:52.133
...so I can't tell whether I will be married by that time or not.

00:52.628 --> 00:54.996
But hopefully, I have a date - mate.

00:55.597 --> 01:00.322
And in 10 years from now, I will have my own house in the middle of an urban area,...

01:00.657 --> 01:01.554
...my own car,...

01:01.915 --> 01:04.761
...and have about 1 million dollars in my bank account.

01:05.427 --> 01:08.482
It may sound like I'm putting the cart before the horse,...

01:08.899 --> 01:11.619
...but I will work really hard to gather wealth.

01:12.162 --> 01:15.126
To make my short - term goals more practical, and real,...

01:15.532 --> 01:17.225
...I should get started now.
