I spent my holiday catching up on old movies.

00:05.302 --> 00:07.315
One of them was "Back to the Future",...

00:07.721 --> 00:09.343
...and while I was watching that movie,...

00:09.764 --> 00:12.009
...I thought with today's advanced technology,...

00:12.395 --> 00:15.382
...a time machine no longer sounds impossible.

00:16.093 --> 00:17.601
What are your thoughts on that?

00:18.323 --> 00:20.815
Do you think the era of time machines will come true?

00:21.512 --> 00:24.378
If so, do you hope to alter the events of the past?

00:24.637 --> 00:28.993
I do enjoy reading and watching movies or books that are about futurism.

00:29.653 --> 00:33.973
And I believe that it's simply a matter of time before we invent the time machine.

00:34.617 --> 00:38.516
I mean, look at all these unbelievable technological means today!

00:39.375 --> 00:41.062
If I had a chance to go back in time,...

00:41.505 --> 00:43.948
...I would choose to go back ten years from today,...

00:44.377 --> 00:49.193
...to fix any regrettable moments that I have had throughout my entire lifetime.

00:49.798 --> 00:55.449
Well, I also thought about going back to times when I made major, big mistakes.

00:55.964 --> 00:58.878
But I believe that we all learn from mistakes,...

00:59.325 --> 01:02.823
...so maybe it'd be better to just leave things the way they are.

01:03.297 --> 01:07.331
Speaking of time machines, I think they would bring chaos to society,...

01:07.737 --> 01:11.526
...and all human beings would want to be perfect, rich and smart.

01:12.059 --> 01:18.679
On the other hand, it would be good if we could change something such as the events that have caused the outbreak of wars.

01:19.017 --> 01:20.357
What a brilliant idea!

01:20.532 --> 01:22.011
I've never thought about it before.

01:22.703 --> 01:26.355
I really wish we could go back to the time before the war and stop it,...

01:26.884 --> 01:28.859
...so that many people don't have to die.

01:29.627 --> 01:34.701
If it was possible, I'm sure this world would be much more peaceful than it is now.

01:35.199 --> 01:37.818
I can't wait to see a working time machine!
