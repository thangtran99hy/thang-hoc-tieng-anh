My friend will come and visit me here in Korea next week.

00:06.001 --> 00:07.635
Mi-na, can you do me a favor?

00:08.189 --> 00:10.393
Since I don't know a lot about Korean culture,...

00:10.697 --> 00:14.637
...I want you to guide us and talk about what makes you proud to be Korean.

00:15.251 --> 00:17.222
Do you think you'll be available to do that?

00:17.563 --> 00:21.561
Absolutely! Let's see, I have to think about it first.

00:22.132 --> 00:25.373
Where should I take him to and what should I be talking about?

00:25.908 --> 00:27.095
What's he interested in?

00:27.369 --> 00:28.115
Good question!

00:28.704 --> 00:30.403
Actually he's a science geek.

00:30.665 --> 00:32.801
He loves playing around with machines.

00:33.445 --> 00:34.609
To give you an idea,...

00:34.847 --> 00:38.315
...maybe it's good to take him to the science fair or something like that...

00:38.673 --> 00:42.235
...since Korea is one of the most technologically advanced countries.

00:42.913 --> 00:47.491
I'm sure he will even love observing people on the subway watching DMB's.

00:48.342 --> 00:54.080
Then he perhaps will enjoy just browsing around at the many different kinds of cell phones in Korea.

00:54.541 --> 00:58.711
You know, Korea exports almost 2/3 of the world's mobile phones.

00:59.247 --> 01:02.562
I guess we could show off the nanotechnology industry too.

01:03.139 --> 01:06.473
Hmm, what are some other attractions we should take him to?

01:07.023 --> 01:09.953
What about shopping malls, department stores and markets?

01:10.431 --> 01:14.588
Many Japanese and Chinese tourists don't miss visiting those places.

01:15.228 --> 01:18.179
I'm pretty sure he will love those crowded places too.
