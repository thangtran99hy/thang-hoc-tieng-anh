If you were to go into retirement tomorrow,...

00:05.740 --> 00:07.648
...what would you do after retirement?

00:08.234 --> 00:15.003
I saw a news article saying Chairman Bill Gates plans to step back from the company he founded, as you know, Microsoft.

00:15.546 --> 00:20.892
After his retirement, he will step up his commitments to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

00:21.417 --> 00:23.507
What a nice way to end his career!

00:24.270 --> 00:28.689
After my retirement, I will do something like him, like charity work.

00:29.266 --> 00:33.093
So that means while I'm in action, I have to save lots of money.

00:33.571 --> 00:35.286
That does sound heartwarming!

00:35.776 --> 00:38.243
I haven't thought about my retirement plan yet,...

00:38.342 --> 00:42.495
...but once I retire, I want to be a headhunter, or recruiting counselor.
