Naming Your Baby.

00:02.090 --> 00:05.580
Honey, I've finally decided what to name our daughter!

00:05.670 --> 00:07.560
I'm so excited to tell you.

00:07.677 --> 00:10.170
I mean, I've been thinking about it all day!

00:10.290 --> 00:12.600
So, are you ready? Here it is.

00:12.773 --> 00:16.460
Our daughter is going to be called... Drum roll please.

00:16.698 --> 00:18.089
Crystal! Yeah!

00:18.181 --> 00:19.381
You know, after my Mom.

00:19.471 --> 00:21.760
Whoa, Whoa, get a hold of yourself!

00:22.020 --> 00:25.550
So what you're saying is, you named our daughter after your Mom?

00:26.000 --> 00:28.963
I thought we agreed to name her after somebody on my side!

00:29.010 --> 00:32.370
Okay, you should sit down and take a deep breath.

00:32.624 --> 00:34.110
Just need to relax a bit.

00:34.614 --> 00:38.139
So, honey, I'm afraid you've forgotten what our last name is.

00:38.273 --> 00:39.950
For your information, it's Glass!

00:40.246 --> 00:42.826
You want our daughter's name to be Crystal Glass?

00:43.003 --> 00:45.645
She's going to be embarrassed about her name all her life!

00:45.949 --> 00:48.018
What if she can't make any friends at school?

00:48.253 --> 00:50.297
What if she becomes an outcast or something?

00:50.615 --> 00:52.559
Okay, I need to take it easy.

00:53.313 --> 00:54.382
Another deep breath.

00:54.614 --> 00:57.968
Okay. So, what's her middle name going to be?

00:57.976 --> 00:59.985
Can I have a say in that department?
