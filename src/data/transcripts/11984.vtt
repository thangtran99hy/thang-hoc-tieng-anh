Meat Or Meatless?

00:01.820 --> 00:02.505
Guess what!

00:02.750 --> 00:07.136
One of my professors said humans are not meant to eat meat or drink cow milk.

00:07.482 --> 00:10.061
So I drank soy milk today and avoided meat.

00:10.248 --> 00:11.042
And you know what?

00:11.242 --> 00:12.499
I already feel better!

00:12.900 --> 00:15.005
I think I'm going to become a vegetarian!

00:15.164 --> 00:16.417
Pull yourself together.

00:16.769 --> 00:19.226
Being a vegetarian can be very good for you...

00:19.651 --> 00:24.411
...but you must be knowledgeable about nutrition so you don't lack important vitamins and minerals.

00:25.021 --> 00:26.627
Our body is very complex.

00:27.062 --> 00:29.439
We need a lot of vitamins to support our system...

00:29.720 --> 00:33.022
...and if you do not have variety, you might be asking for trouble.

00:33.692 --> 00:36.197
And, I need you to settle down and think about this.

00:36.709 --> 00:38.338
Meat is good for you too!

00:38.820 --> 00:42.655
A benefit of meat is that it not only helps you develop a good immune system...

00:43.042 --> 00:46.177
...but also helps you break down other nutrients in your digestive system.

00:46.702 --> 00:47.808
Meat or meatless?

00:48.535 --> 00:49.554
It is your choice...

00:49.879 --> 00:55.876
...but some meat, such as chicken, once in a while will help you greatly by providing you with necessary protein.
