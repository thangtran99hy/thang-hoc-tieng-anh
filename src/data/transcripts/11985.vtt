Victim of Homeschooling?

00:03.600 --> 00:07.470
Did I ever tell you that I was homeschooled from K-12th grade?

00:07.790 --> 00:10.660
To this day I have horrible social skills,...

00:10.710 --> 00:12.460
...poor academic skills and almost...

00:12.500 --> 00:15.210
...no ability to reach out and connect with people.

00:15.560 --> 00:18.520
I have never met a "normal" person who was homeschooled...

00:18.770 --> 00:20.090
...and I doubt I ever will.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.760
Oh, and did I ever mention that I've gone to counseling?

00:23.950 --> 00:24.670
It didn't help.

00:25.030 --> 00:26.970
Someone who grew up pampered and rich...

00:27.120 --> 00:29.700
...(which seems to be all the therapists I went to)...

00:29.770 --> 00:31.460
...cannot even begin to understand...

00:31.670 --> 00:34.270
...the pain of the shelter and abuse I've suffered from.

00:34.340 --> 00:36.970
Hannah, there are plenty of homeschooled people out there.

00:37.340 --> 00:41.440
Just because you were homeschooled does not mean your parents were controlling or anything.

00:41.890 --> 00:45.810
They felt that was a better learning environment than the local public schools.

00:46.810 --> 00:49.230
You need to take control and make the changes you want...

00:49.440 --> 00:50.950
...and stop blaming your parents.

00:51.100 --> 00:52.750
They did it out of love for you,...

00:52.930 --> 00:54.490
...not to be intentionally mean.

00:54.880 --> 00:57.800
It's your life, and you need to take charge.
