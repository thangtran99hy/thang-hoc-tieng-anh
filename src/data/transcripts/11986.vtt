Dr. John Dolittle lived in a small town called Puddleby.

00:06.030 --> 00:08.640
He lived in a small house, but he had a large garden.

00:09.410 --> 00:11.070
He kept many animals in his garden.

00:11.770 --> 00:14.130
Dr. Dolittle did not have many patients.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.320
Most people did not like all his animals.

00:18.330 --> 00:20.950
One day, the cat's meatman said to him,...

00:22.040 --> 00:27.810
..."Why don't you stop being a doctor for people and become a doctor for animals instead?"

00:28.380 --> 00:32.370
"You know a lot about animals, more than most vets, I'm sure."

00:33.460 --> 00:37.910
When the cat's meatman left, Polynesia, the parrot, flew onto the table.

00:39.190 --> 00:44.370
"He's right, Doctor," Polynesia said. "You should become an animal doctor."

00:45.150 --> 00:49.050
"There are a lot of vets," Dr. Dolittle said.

00:49.730 --> 00:52.970
"Perhaps there are, but you'd be the best vet of all."

00:53.480 --> 00:55.480
"I'm not the only animal that can talk."

00:55.720 --> 01:00.000
"All the animals can talk. Each kind of animal has its own language."

01:00.970 --> 01:02.530
"I'll teach you mine if you like."

01:03.170 --> 01:06.470
Every day, Dr. Dolittle learned the languages of the animals.

01:07.100 --> 01:11.720
When people found out he was now an animal doctor, they brought their pets to him.

01:12.220 --> 01:18.010
Before long, every animal that lived in or near Puddleby became the doctor's patients.

01:18.610 --> 01:21.570
He was very happy and he liked his life very much.
