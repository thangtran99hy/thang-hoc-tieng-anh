Ways to Decrease Our Water Consumption.

00:04.065 --> 00:06.810
All over the world, water is becoming scarce.

00:07.100 --> 00:09.640
Droughts have led to water restrictions in the cities...

00:09.800 --> 00:12.510
...as well as in agriculture and manufacturing.

00:13.040 --> 00:15.780
So, what are the best and most innovative ways...

00:15.970 --> 00:17.720
...to decrease water consumption?

00:17.940 --> 00:20.720
Here are some simple steps that people can take...

00:20.930 --> 00:22.870
...to decrease their use of water:...

00:23.460 --> 00:26.090
Only use the washing machine when it is full.

00:26.490 --> 00:28.570
Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth.

00:29.240 --> 00:30.560
Keep your showers short.

00:30.950 --> 00:33.800
A shower uses 10 to 20 liters of water a minute.

00:34.220 --> 00:36.370
You don't sing in the shower anymore, do you?

00:36.890 --> 00:38.470
It might not seem like a lot...

00:38.790 --> 00:41.610
...but if everybody does those little things, it will add up,...

00:41.660 --> 00:42.500
...don't you think?
