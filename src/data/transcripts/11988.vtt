If it doesn't disturb you,...

00:04.040 --> 00:06.700
...can I ask you about aging in Korea?

00:07.160 --> 00:10.480
I heard the number of aging people is increasing in Korea.

00:10.880 --> 00:11.810
That's right.

00:12.310 --> 00:15.980
Korea became an aging society since 2007.

00:16.300 --> 00:17.850
According to statistics,...

00:18.050 --> 00:21.420
...even though Korea is now only in the preliminary stage,...

00:21.710 --> 00:27.720
...it will soon become a super - aged society with 14 percent of the population being elderly...

00:27.980 --> 00:32.870
...by 2018, and 20 percent by 2026.

00:33.320 --> 00:34.340
I also heard that...

00:34.390 --> 00:38.190
...this is a direct result of dramatically decreased birth rates...

00:38.450 --> 00:40.640
...and longer life expectancies.

00:40.990 --> 00:45.760
I even heard something like the average life span of Koreans will be extended...

00:45.860 --> 00:52.410
...from 75.9 years old in 2001 to 81.5 years old in 2030,...

00:52.800 --> 00:55.150
...which is the same level of developed countries.

00:55.290 --> 00:57.030
Wow, what a surprise!

00:57.420 --> 00:59.860
I didn't know how fast this was happening.

01:00.210 --> 01:04.930
Well, then Koreans should start preparing well for an aging society, right?

01:05.090 --> 01:07.130
You're right. I agree with you.

01:07.490 --> 01:09.340
Everybody will get old soon.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.300
We are not an exception.

01:11.490 --> 01:13.970
If we do not prepare for the aging society,...

01:14.200 --> 01:17.180
...Korea will experience some painful days ahead.

01:17.500 --> 01:18.850
Time will go fast...

01:18.950 --> 01:21.480
...and I want everybody to be happy in the future.

01:21.590 --> 01:23.420
I fully agree with what you said.

01:23.710 --> 01:25.280
To be more specific,...

01:25.500 --> 01:27.830
...the Korean government and the private sector...

01:28.100 --> 01:30.490
...should closely work together on this problem...

01:30.650 --> 01:34.200
...so there should be more jobs especially for old people in the future.

01:34.800 --> 01:38.260
I can see most of the elderly in Korea are not working...

01:38.400 --> 01:40.630
...because there is no company which hires them.

01:41.170 --> 01:43.820
I believe the implementation of support...

01:43.890 --> 01:46.530
...policies for the elderly is also important.
