00:02.730 --> 00:04.870
I saw this word, "Gireogi-abba",...

00:05.000 --> 00:06.140
...a goose father.

00:06.200 --> 00:07.240
What does it mean?

00:07.600 --> 00:11.100
I'm sure it has a symbolic meaning just like the word, "Deun Jang Nyeo".

00:11.600 --> 00:14.110
That word appeared in an article, which talked about...

00:14.200 --> 00:16.270
...an increasing number of family members...

00:16.680 --> 00:18.390
...children and mothers going abroad,...

00:18.500 --> 00:20.350
...primarily to study English.

00:20.710 --> 00:22.150
So I'm guessing,...

00:22.330 --> 00:26.590
..."Gireogi-abba" means a man going through a midlife crisis...

00:26.870 --> 00:28.960
...while his family lives far away from him?

00:29.110 --> 00:30.200
Am I on the right track?

00:30.420 --> 00:33.180
You are! To be more specific,...

00:33.540 --> 00:37.970
..."Gireogi-abba" indicates a father, typically around forty years old,...

00:38.250 --> 00:43.970
...who endures a life of solitude after sending his children and wife to study overseas.

00:44.390 --> 00:48.110
Let's see, it's like the word "a grass widower",...

00:48.260 --> 00:51.480
...meaning a man whose wife is temporarily absent.

00:51.980 --> 00:55.440
When a man reaches middle age and goes through a midlife crisis,...

00:55.800 --> 00:59.890
...there exists a period of frustration and feelings of pointlessness.

01:00.200 --> 01:01.890
They feel down in the dumps.

01:02.390 --> 01:03.440
Imagine how he has...

01:03.570 --> 01:07.400
...to endure this when none of his family members are around him for support.

01:07.810 --> 01:11.070
Wow, Korean parents are very devoted to their children.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.940
I do understand a little bit, but...

01:14.090 --> 01:16.640
...when a man reaches the age of 40 something,...

01:16.770 --> 01:20.080
...I guess it's time for him to prepare for his own life...

01:20.290 --> 01:23.250
...you know, spend time and money on himself.

01:23.550 --> 01:26.520
But what I see in this highly competitive country...

01:26.700 --> 01:30.890
...educationally, parents are just ready to sacrifice for their children.
