Did you check out that article saying a British person...

00:06.300 --> 00:09.780
...took photos of a UFO hovering over southwest England?

00:10.210 --> 00:14.480
Every time I see those articles or pictures about people witnessing UFOs,...

00:14.810 --> 00:17.890
...I think that they are just so eager to see one,...

00:18.090 --> 00:21.720
...but what they really see is not the same as what they want to see.

00:21.990 --> 00:25.590
What about you? Do you believe in UFOs or aliens?

00:26.050 --> 00:28.910
I remember after watching "E.T." when I was young,...

00:29.210 --> 00:31.830
...I always dreamed about playing with an alien,...

00:32.100 --> 00:34.430
...or taking a ride on a flying saucer.

00:34.690 --> 00:37.540
If an alien does look like the one from "E.T.",...

00:37.800 --> 00:40.720
...then I see no problem being a good friend with him,...

00:41.200 --> 00:44.500
...but if it turns out to be a threatening, scary one,...

00:44.790 --> 00:46.580
...then I would just run away from him.

00:46.800 --> 00:47.950
Well, in fact,...

00:48.220 --> 00:52.180
...there are many movies or books on UFOs or space attacks these days,...

00:52.480 --> 00:55.750
...so I don't think it will be a big surprise if I see one,...

00:55.990 --> 00:58.190
...unless it starts attacking people.

00:58.250 --> 01:01.330
There is a comedy movie called "Scary Movie 3"...

01:01.500 --> 01:03.260
...where there are a bunch of aliens...

01:03.300 --> 01:05.900
...who came to the earth to goof around and then left.

01:06.120 --> 01:08.100
I laughed so hard!

01:08.490 --> 01:12.600
Well, more and more entertainment sectors choose aliens or UFOs...

01:12.800 --> 01:16.780
...as a main topic so it's become a somewhat friendly issue.

01:17.300 --> 01:18.240
You're right.

01:18.500 --> 01:21.280
I can also find a lot of movies or comics...

01:21.500 --> 01:25.470
...in which one of the characters is an alien with a somewhat strange face.

01:25.900 --> 01:28.830
It was kind of weird when I saw it for the first time.

01:29.100 --> 01:31.620
But these days I really enjoy seeing them.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.890
If they really exist in the world,...

01:33.990 --> 01:36.130
...I really want to meet them someday!
