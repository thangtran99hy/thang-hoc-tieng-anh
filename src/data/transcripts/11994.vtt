00:02.391 --> 00:05.134
One day, Robin went into the forest alone.

00:05.603 --> 00:07.615
He came to a bridge across a river.

00:08.157 --> 00:09.952
He began to cross the bridge.

00:10.324 --> 00:15.148
As he did so, a man began to cross the bridge from the other side of the river.

00:15.788 --> 00:18.444
The two men met in the middle of the bridge.

00:18.741 --> 00:21.031
There was not enough room for them to pass.

00:21.958 --> 00:24.913
"I was on the bridge first," Robin said.

00:25.566 --> 00:28.695
"You were not," the other man said.

00:29.232 --> 00:33.588
He was much taller than Robin. "I was on the bridge first."

00:34.133 --> 00:39.268
The two men fought for a long time. They hit one another hard with their staffs.

00:39.765 --> 00:45.211
Then, the tall man hit Robin very hard. He fell off the bridge and into the river.

00:45.664 --> 00:49.418
At this moment, Will and some of Robin's men came out of the forest.

00:49.887 --> 00:53.418
"No," Robin answered as he climbed out of the river.

00:53.961 --> 00:59.483
"Who are you?" Robin asked the tall man. "What are you doing in the forest?"

01:00.425 --> 01:03.763
"I am looking for Robin Hood," the tall man said.

01:04.417 --> 01:07.158
"Oh! Why are you looking for him?"

01:08.093 --> 01:13.019
"I want to join his band of outlaws. I want to be one of his men."

01:13.897 --> 01:17.804
"Why do you want to become an outlaw?" Robin asked him.

01:18.550 --> 01:22.184
"I am already an outlaw," the tall man said.

01:22.706 --> 01:27.979
"Prince John took my lands and gave them to one of his men. Now, I have no home."

01:29.082 --> 01:34.394
Robin shook his hand. "Welcome. I am Robin Hood," he said.

01:34.890 --> 01:40.038
"I need strong and brave men like you. You may join my band of outlaws."

01:40.877 --> 01:42.990
"What is your name?" Will asked him.

01:43.848 --> 01:46.068
"John Little," the tall man said.

01:46.788 --> 01:53.171
Robin laughed. "You are so tall," he said, "we will call you Little John!"

01:54.045 --> 01:57.927
And this was how Little John became one of Robin's best friends.
