September 2011 will mark four years since the release of the Foo Fighters' last release...

00:15.470 --> 00:17.610
..."Echo, Silence, Patience and Grace".

00:17.990 --> 00:20.480
And now, Foo fans have reason for celebration.

00:21.150 --> 00:25.870
Singer - songwriter Dave Grohl and crew tweeted about their time in the recording studio,...

00:26.040 --> 00:31.730
...saying, quote, "Ladies and gentlemen, we are officially done. Champagne anyone?", end quote.

00:32.370 --> 00:36.650
Foo Fighters' sound has evolved as Dave has learned to trust his singing voice.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.890
In an interview shortly before the release of their last album,...

00:40.100 --> 00:45.320
...Grohl told Artisan News that just about anything could now be considered a Foo Fighters tune.

00:45.510 --> 00:52.380
Whether it's an accordion, a mandolin and an acoustic guitar,...

00:52.780 --> 00:58.060
...or four people with electric guitars, it's just Foo Fighters, you know.

00:58.640 --> 01:02.590
And I think that's the idea, is just get to the point where, you know, it's...

01:02.860 --> 01:04.450
...anything could be a Foo Fighters song, you know.

01:04.840 --> 01:10.230
There has been no release date but the Foos are already soliciting talent for someone to direct their new video.
