Americans have enjoyed the tradition of drinking coffee for a relatively short time,...

00:10.309 --> 00:13.735
...but they managed to establish the most famous coffee house chain...

00:14.171 --> 00:17.705
...and make it to one of the most expensive brands in the world.

00:18.577 --> 00:21.299
Is this just for the sake of money and power?

00:21.813 --> 00:26.447
No, it's a question of imagination and crystal - clear principles.

00:27.359 --> 00:29.511
The core of Starbucks philosophy...

00:29.774 --> 00:32.690
...is expressed by CEO Howard Schultz,...

00:33.317 --> 00:36.219
..."We are not in the coffee business, serving people."

00:36.690 --> 00:39.531
"We are in the people business, serving coffee."

00:40.523 --> 00:44.227
Every sales clerk in every Starbucks branch in the world...

00:44.569 --> 00:48.651
...has internalized the basic five principles: be welcoming,...

00:48.985 --> 00:53.333
...authentic, caring, knowledgeable and dedicated.

00:54.146 --> 00:56.769
There are many reasons for the company's success,...

00:57.069 --> 01:01.661
...from their holistic approach of their mission statement to the quality of their coffee,...

01:02.157 --> 01:06.771
...to their environmentally friendly corporate social responsibility statement.

01:07.597 --> 01:11.291
Their marketing strategy is unconventional and stimulating.

01:12.044 --> 01:15.361
And if this innovative company comes up with a new campaign,...

01:15.725 --> 01:17.744
...other companies should take notes.
