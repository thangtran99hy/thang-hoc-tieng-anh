Here are seven dating tips.

00:05.331 --> 00:11.591
First, you should not ask a woman if you could date her because women like men who are in control.

00:12.200 --> 00:18.331
Second, you will also look insecure if you ask a woman about her previous relationships.

00:18.973 --> 00:24.408
Third, a man should never try to impress a woman by boasting about his wealth.

00:25.129 --> 00:28.389
She will be more impressed if money is not mentioned.

00:29.201 --> 00:33.757
Four, women don't like to have to think about what to do on a date.

00:34.411 --> 00:38.077
Men should have a plan, so don't ask her to come up with one.

00:39.042 --> 00:45.352
Five, a man looks as if he lacks confidence if he asks a woman if she likes him.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.467
It will put her off the man for sure.

00:49.286 --> 00:54.330
In sixth place is, don't ask a woman why she has not answered your message.

00:55.087 --> 00:58.097
It will make her feel guilty, which is not helpful.

00:58.818 --> 01:05.383
And lastly, you should never ask a woman if you could kiss her, because you will look immature to her.
