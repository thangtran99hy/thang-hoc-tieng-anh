00:00.801 --> 00:07.563
Imagine prisoners that have spent their entire lives chained deep inside a cave.

00:09.594 --> 00:12.543
They have been chained so that they cannot see behind themselves.

00:13.983 --> 00:18.263
And they are forced to stare endlessly at the cave wall in front of them.

00:20.902 --> 00:22.573
Behind them, a fire is burning.

00:24.277 --> 00:27.513
And between the prisoners and the fire is a raised walkway.

00:30.415 --> 00:35.669
Now imagine that each day, a menagerie of objects crosses the walkway,...

00:37.255 --> 00:40.729
...animals and people carrying their wares to market.

00:46.583 --> 00:50.733
Their shapes create an intricate shadow play on the wall in front of the prisoners.

00:55.361 --> 00:59.074
This is the only world that the prisoners have ever known,...

01:03.231 --> 01:07.165
...the shadows and the echoes of unseen objects.

01:10.991 --> 01:14.146
Now imagine that a prisoner is released.

01:20.125 --> 01:22.347
After some time adjusting to the blinding light,...

01:25.159 --> 01:30.649
...the free prisoner will begin to experience the world outside of the cave for the very first time.

01:32.708 --> 01:34.775
And it is like nothing he could have ever imagined.

01:47.938 --> 01:49.396
With his new perception of the world,...

01:50.019 --> 01:54.073
...the man would of course want to return to his friends to share his incredible discoveries.

01:59.115 --> 02:01.727
But the prisoners cannot recognize their old friend.

02:03.065 --> 02:04.763
He appears as all things do.

02:06.159 --> 02:08.291
His voice is a distorted echo.

02:09.194 --> 02:11.896
And his body is a grotesque shadow.

02:14.158 --> 02:17.813
They cannot understand his fantastic stories of the world outside of the cave.

02:19.300 --> 02:22.039
To them it will never exist.

02:23.911 --> 02:31.433
This of course, does not make the world outside of the cave any less real.
