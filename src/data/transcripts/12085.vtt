Imagine this oscillating fan is your computer password...

00:09.030 --> 00:11.420
...and David Hasselhoff is a cyber criminal.

00:12.070 --> 00:14.680
David Hasselhoff does not like your oscillating fan.

00:15.120 --> 00:19.710
Oscillating fans muss hair and no one musses the Hoff's hair.

00:20.371 --> 00:25.981
The oscillating fan, not knowing any better, continues to gently oscillate and fan.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.029
Now, you have a choice.

00:28.604 --> 00:31.974
Do you allow Hasselhoff to have his way with your oscillating fan...

00:32.463 --> 00:33.961
...or do you deny it?

00:36.542 --> 00:37.949
Oh, a pretzel.

00:46.043 --> 00:48.895
Protect your oscillating fan from David Hasselhoff.

00:49.094 --> 00:52.329
