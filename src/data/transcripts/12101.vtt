Hey, Darren here with Engadget.

00:05.016 --> 00:07.407
We're at Toshiba's booth at SID 2011...

00:07.927 --> 00:10.213
...taking a look at their new mobile display.

00:10.306 --> 00:12.420
This has 367 PPI.

00:12.787 --> 00:14.995
It's obviously a true 720 display here.

00:16.627 --> 00:18.261
This is a four - inch panel...

00:18.853 --> 00:23.017
...and we have been told it will show up in at least one phone later this year,...

00:23.901 --> 00:25.278
...so it will be in the market.

00:26.209 --> 00:30.643
The viewing angles are a little bit worse than a Nexus phone here.

00:31.151 --> 00:33.208
But obviously the resolution is pretty incredible.

00:36.183 --> 00:41.921
Obviously a good panel to get if you would be watching a lot of movies or images here.

00:43.005 --> 00:47.732
As for touch enablement, we're told that's up to the partners...

00:47.803 --> 00:52.131
...so we can pretty much bet that whoever takes this on is gonna put a touchscreen on top of it.

00:53.209 --> 00:55.679
So we couldn't pry out who exactly is gonna be using this...

00:55.798 --> 00:57.950
...but it will be in the market later this year.

00:58.805 --> 01:02.987
So you'll be able to get a 720p display on your future phone.

01:03.080 --> 01:06.380
So, yeah, the retina display has got a little catching up to do.
