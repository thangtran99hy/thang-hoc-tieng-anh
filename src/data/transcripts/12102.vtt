00:05.221 --> 00:08.371
There's yet another creature that roams Cuba's underworld.

00:09.536 --> 00:10.967
It emerges mostly at night...

00:11.931 --> 00:13.311
...and stays close to its hole.

00:20.467 --> 00:22.709
But once a year, triggered by rain,...

00:23.533 --> 00:25.800
...the females all emerge en masse.

00:38.403 --> 00:41.339
Millions of female red crabs march together...

00:41.832 --> 00:44.515
...in one of the largest mass migrations in the world.

00:46.992 --> 00:51.467
This marathon can cover nearly ten kilometers and take days.

00:53.493 --> 00:55.154
Especially if they take a wrong turn.

01:01.864 --> 01:04.585
So, where are they going and why?

01:14.597 --> 01:18.936
They're heading for the Caribbean sea with one purpose in mind.

01:22.931 --> 01:25.494
These may be air - breathing land crabs,...

01:26.307 --> 01:28.415
...but they still need water for one thing:...

01:29.935 --> 01:30.607
...to breed.

01:32.984 --> 01:35.589
Each crab is carrying a pouch of precious eggs.

01:36.569 --> 01:38.703
And now, she has to cast them adrift...

01:39.780 --> 01:41.469
...without letting herself be swept away.

01:53.800 --> 01:54.959
Once the eggs hit water,...

01:55.435 --> 01:57.023
...they hatch into tiny larvae.

01:58.315 --> 01:59.587
And then about a month's time,...

02:00.017 --> 02:02.781
...they'll climb back ashore to start their life on land.
