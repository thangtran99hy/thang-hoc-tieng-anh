The Bookend Trust is pleased to introduce a new patron, Neil Gaiman.

00:05.997 --> 00:11.199
Hello, I'm Neil Gaiman and I'm pleased to launch the envirothon competition for the Bookend Trust.

00:11.763 --> 00:17.051
The award - winning author of works including Coraline, Sandman and the new Doctor Who,...

00:17.665 --> 00:20.938
...together with his wife, multi - talented performer Amanda Palmer,...

00:21.382 --> 00:25.785
...Neil recently visited Tasmania, and took a great interest in the wildlife...

00:25.884 --> 00:27.577
...and environmental opportunities here.

00:28.293 --> 00:31.431
Together they have a special message for Tasmanian students.

00:32.214 --> 00:36.743
Tasmania is a really wonderful place and its environment and the animals are...

00:37.612 --> 00:38.816
...part of what make it so special.

00:39.439 --> 00:44.733
And they're all unique and fascinating and there are some things in Tasmania that don't exist anywhere else in the world.

00:45.025 --> 00:50.367
You can have experiences and build careers working on species and places unlike anywhere else in the whole world.

00:51.229 --> 00:53.869
So good luck to all of the students participating in...

00:54.273 --> 00:56.970
...and watching this and future envirothons.

00:57.451 --> 00:59.757
Make the most of this opportunity and enjoy it...

01:00.063 --> 01:01.725
...'cause Tasmania is really special.
