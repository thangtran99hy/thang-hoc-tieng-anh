I'm used to thinking of the TED audience as a wonderful collection of some of the most...

00:19.462 --> 00:21.645
...effective, intelligent, intellectual,...

00:22.839 --> 00:26.432
..savvy, worldly, and innovative people in the world, and I think that's true.

00:26.989 --> 00:31.309
However, I also have reason to believe that many, if not, most of you,...

00:31.785 --> 00:34.067
...are actually tying your shoes incorrectly.

00:35.341 --> 00:39.418
Now, I know that seems ludicrous. I know that seems ludicrous.

00:39.790 --> 00:43.327
And believe me, I lived the same sad life until about three years ago.

00:44.177 --> 00:48.725
And what happened to me was I bought, what was for me, a very expensive pair of shoes.

00:49.074 --> 00:53.009
But those shoes came with round nylon laces, and I couldn't keep them tied.

00:53.406 --> 00:57.459
So, I went back to the store and said to the owner, "I love the shoes, but I hate the laces."

00:57.968 --> 01:00.376
He took a look and said, "Oh, you're tying them wrong."

01:01.412 --> 01:05.205
Now, up until that moment, I would have thought that by age 50,...

01:05.713 --> 01:11.906
...one of the life skills that I had really nailed was tying my shoes, but not so.

01:12.054 --> 01:12.853
Let me demonstrate.

01:15.305 --> 01:19.745
This is the way that most of us were taught to tie our shoes.

01:23.103 --> 01:24.068
Now as it turns out,...

01:24.374 --> 01:24.661
Thank you!

01:26.715 --> 01:27.582
So wait, there's more.

01:28.022 --> 01:33.201
...As it turns out, there's a strong form and a weak form of this knot,...

01:33.482 --> 01:35.836
...and we were taught to tie the weak form. And here's how to tell.

01:36.448 --> 01:38.552
If you pull the strands at the base of the knot,...

01:39.133 --> 01:43.345
...you can see that the bow will orient itself down the long axis of the shoe.

01:43.789 --> 01:45.177
That's the weak form of the knot.

01:45.645 --> 01:46.387
But not to worry.

01:47.745 --> 01:53.642
If we start over and simply go the other direction around the bow,...

01:54.240 --> 01:56.883
...we get this, the strong form of the knot.

01:57.335 --> 02:00.203
And if you pull the cords under the knot, you will see that...

02:00.859 --> 02:04.120
...the bow orients itself along the transverse axis of the shoe.

02:04.738 --> 02:08.019
This is a stronger knot. It will come untied less often.

02:08.330 --> 02:11.963
It will let you down less. And not only that, it looks better.

02:12.942 --> 02:14.315
We're gonna do this one more time.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.089
Start as usual,...

02:21.833 --> 02:23.616
...go the other way around the loop.

02:23.736 --> 02:26.228
This is a little hard for children, but I think you can handle it.

02:29.368 --> 02:30.079
Pull the knot.

02:31.588 --> 02:33.857
There it is, the strong form of the shoe knot.

02:34.496 --> 02:40.462
Now, in keeping with today's theme, I'd like to point out and something you already know,...

02:40.815 --> 02:44.239
...that sometimes, a small advantage someplace in life...

02:44.699 --> 02:47.301
...can yield tremendous results someplace else.

02:48.681 --> 02:49.680
Live long and prosper.
