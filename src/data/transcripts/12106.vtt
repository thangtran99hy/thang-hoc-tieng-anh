It was on a baseball diamond that Dugan Smith first knew something was wrong with his leg.

00:06.863 --> 00:11.416
After sliding in the base, his right knee felt unusually stiff and sore.

00:11.519 --> 00:15.011
But that night I looked at his knee and he had three little bumps on his knee, that...

00:15.421 --> 00:18.413
...we could actually move around and we're like, "What is that?"

00:18.515 --> 00:22.966
It turned out to be a malignant tumor, the size of a softball on Dugan's thigh bone.

00:23.147 --> 00:25.703
After undergoing chemotherapy to kill the cancer,...

00:25.904 --> 00:29.576
...Dugan then underwent a rare and remarkable procedure.

00:29.705 --> 00:32.611
Basically, we take out the entire middle part of the leg...

00:33.309 --> 00:36.977
...and then we take the bottom part of the leg and leave the nerves connected.

00:38.428 --> 00:42.606
We reconnect the blood vessels and we turn the leg around backwards.

00:42.880 --> 00:45.833
It's called the Van Nes Rotationplasty procedure...

00:45.913 --> 00:50.120
...performed by Dr. Joel Mayerson of Ohio State's James Cancer Hospital.

00:50.461 --> 00:52.861
He says by turning Dugan's leg around backwards,...

00:53.145 --> 00:55.795
...his calf muscle is now acting as his thigh...

00:56.126 --> 00:58.268
...and his ankle has become his knee.

00:58.655 --> 01:03.978
And because his bone is alive and well as Dugan grows, his leg does too.

01:04.329 --> 01:08.058
Today with the help of a prosthesis, Dugan is not only walking again,...

01:08.335 --> 01:11.741
...he's playing basketball and his favorite sport baseball,...

01:12.488 --> 01:15.465
...much to the delight of his father and coach.

01:15.713 --> 01:21.233
He's a very upbeat positive kid. He's always been that way. He's always been very competitive,...

01:21.618 --> 01:23.163
...so I knew those things would help him.

01:23.267 --> 01:26.667
Those qualities have helped not only in getting him back in the game,...

01:29.359 --> 01:32.593
...but learning what winning is truly all about.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.019
People can see that,...

01:34.405 --> 01:37.853
...just because a you have a prosthetic leg doesn't mean you can't do it.

01:38.149 --> 01:41.107
So, I just like to show people that I can do anything that I want to do.

01:41.700 --> 01:45.086
At Ohio State's James Cancer Hospital, this is Clark Powell reporting.
