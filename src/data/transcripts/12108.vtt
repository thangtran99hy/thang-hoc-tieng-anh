At Emory University in Atlanta,...

00:12.415 --> 00:15.760
...a researcher wants to help babies communicate with their parents,...

00:18.882 --> 00:22.258
...only babies have no ability to say what's on their minds.

00:22.719 --> 00:26.845
So they communicate through behavior that often leaves parents clueless.

00:27.387 --> 00:31.215
I think that it's extremely important that we are able to...

00:31.516 --> 00:36.499
...better help parents understand the apparent erratic behavior of their children.

00:37.035 --> 00:40.225
Dr. Michelle Lample headed the study on sleep and growth.

00:40.746 --> 00:44.511
She says it's this erratic behavior that leaves parents frustrated.

00:44.999 --> 00:47.857
The most challenging part of being a parent...

00:48.503 --> 00:52.595
...of a young infant is wanting to do what's best for them...

00:53.017 --> 00:57.505
...and wanting to respond to them. And when they cry...

00:58.189 --> 01:01.667
...and when their behavior patterns are so erratic,...

01:01.958 --> 01:05.365
...it makes me feel, as a parent, very insecure.

01:05.947 --> 01:09.837
So Dr. Lample asked parents to write down everything their babies did,...

01:10.229 --> 01:12.490
...including when they slept and when they ate.

01:13.054 --> 01:19.273
Researchers also visited the homes and recorded their own data on 23 babies for 17 months.

01:19.493 --> 01:25.305
This particular study was designed to ask the specific question:...

01:25.413 --> 01:30.065
...Is there an association between sleep behavior and growth spurts?

01:30.739 --> 01:35.695
And this study documents that, yes indeed, common perception...

01:36.030 --> 01:40.995
...that increased sleep precedes growth, is in fact the case.

01:41.409 --> 01:46.089
The researchers also found that longer periods of sleep in both boys and girls...

01:46.445 --> 01:48.229
...also predicted increased weight.

01:48.641 --> 01:49.318
What's more,...

01:49.601 --> 01:53.547
...the study showed differences between the sleep patterns of boys and girls.

01:54.018 --> 01:56.447
Boys would sleep for longer periods of time...

01:56.894 --> 02:00.621
...while girls would sleep for a long stretch and then add a nap.

02:01.339 --> 02:05.945
Dr. Lample says the research shows that seemingly erratic sleep behavior...

02:06.290 --> 02:08.163
...is a normal part of development.

02:09.849 --> 02:10.655
What's next?

02:11.039 --> 02:13.055
Dr. Lample wants to review the data...

02:13.320 --> 02:17.665
...to see if babies tend to eat more before or during a growth spurt.
