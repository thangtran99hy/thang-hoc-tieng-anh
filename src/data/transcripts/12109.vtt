Hello, record fans. My name is Lucky Diamond Rich...

00:16.553 --> 00:25.371
...and I am the current Guinness World Record holder for the most tattooed person in the world.

00:26.275 --> 00:30.758
Well, I started getting tattooed because basically, I was traveling with a circus...

00:30.845 --> 00:35.871
...and yeah, it was just one of those things. It was an underground art form...

00:35.981 --> 00:38.621
...and it was a way of being able to collect art.

00:39.512 --> 00:44.209
Because I was an artist already, I decided that that would be a good thing to do.

00:44.317 --> 00:51.464
And yeah, I just got a few tattoos here and there and like postcards from different areas.

00:51.541 --> 00:55.167
And then it just went from there and obviously because I kept traveling...

00:55.262 --> 01:00.552
...and doing that, it just kinda ended up being one, big, massive postcard.

01:01.373 --> 01:07.665
I started experimenting with black tattooing, solid black tattooing...

01:07.753 --> 01:15.937
...and the idea of going over the black with different patterns in white or color.

01:17.177 --> 01:25.631
And yeah, that was pretty successful so yeah, I did that and it ended up being a good idea.

01:25.699 --> 01:29.689
And it worked out good, so I just went, "That's it. That's what I'm gonna do."

01:29.770 --> 01:32.040
"I'm gonna cover everything that I've got."

01:32.119 --> 01:35.086
My first layer and then these solid black,...

01:35.734 --> 01:38.464
...and then go over that with white, and then go over that with color.

01:38.535 --> 01:44.502
So, it's just a way to either push the tattoo art form forward...

01:44.703 --> 01:47.130
...and to do something that no one else had done.

01:48.317 --> 01:53.616
And also, on the way, snatch the world record.
