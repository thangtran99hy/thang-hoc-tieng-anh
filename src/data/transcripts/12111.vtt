00:11.234 --> 00:16.537
The film shown on the museum's huge planetarium screen examines myths and rituals...

00:16.618 --> 00:20.023
...of the ancient Maya in southern Mexico and Central America.

00:20.361 --> 00:23.651
It focuses on the Maya calendar or Long Count,...

00:24.007 --> 00:29.014
...which was divided into Baktuns of 144,000 days each.

00:29.479 --> 00:33.807
All Maya kept the same ritual, solar, and Long Count calendars,...

00:34.028 --> 00:37.451
...using them to describe the past and foretell the future.

00:38.619 --> 00:46.929
On some surviving calendars, everything ends on the day equivalent to our date of December 21st, 2012.

00:47.405 --> 00:52.725
Carolyn Sumners, Vice President of the museum's Department of Astronomy and Physical Science,...

00:52.957 --> 00:54.676
...supervised the film project.

00:55.161 --> 00:58.463
There's an alignment with the center of the galaxy on December 21st.

00:58.849 --> 01:03.390
It just happens that the Maya 13th Baktun starts on December 21st,...

01:03.701 --> 01:05.953
...at least in some of the calendars,...

01:06.373 --> 01:11.889
...and just enough going on to make one want to wonder, "Is it all connected?"

01:13.274 --> 01:18.325
But the film makes it clear that the Maya were not necessarily predicting catastrophe.

01:19.695 --> 01:24.024
Sumners says, the end of the Maya time periods generally were regarded...

01:24.081 --> 01:28.999
...the same way we look at such things as the start of a new century or a new millennium.

01:29.320 --> 01:32.257
It seems to be a cause for celebration.

01:33.341 --> 01:39.299
There doesn't seem to be any indication in the Maya writings of great disasters.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.153
They did believe in the end of time.

01:41.246 --> 01:42.701
They talked about great floods.

01:43.030 --> 01:44.892
All these things were discussed,...

01:45.363 --> 01:47.372
...but they didn't tie them to the Long Count.

01:48.851 --> 01:51.585
To bring audiences into the world of the Maya,...

01:51.677 --> 01:55.775
...Sumners and her team went to four sites in Mexico and Guatemala...

01:55.739 --> 01:58.764
...to shoot extreme wide - angle video of the ruins.

01:59.727 --> 02:02.272
They employed computer - generated images...

02:02.317 --> 02:05.646
...to show what those sites might have looked like centuries ago...

02:05.676 --> 02:09.975
...when they were the centers of great Maya achievements in mathematics and astronomy.

02:11.186 --> 02:17.239
Visitors to Houston's Natural Science Museum can also see the Maya artifacts on display.

02:17.895 --> 02:22.875
Curator Dirk Van Tuerenhout is developing an even larger exhibit for next year...

02:22.977 --> 02:25.420
...to coincide with the end - of - the - world date.

02:25.805 --> 02:30.357
It's a combination of all kinds of source of information that we're pulling together...

02:30.893 --> 02:36.201
...to tell the story of the Maya culture, ancient Maya, colonial Maya, modern Maya.

02:36.677 --> 02:40.436
The Maya civilization collapsed more than 500 years ago,...

02:40.731 --> 02:45.137
...probably because of environmental changes that undermined its agriculture.

02:45.431 --> 02:50.345
But Maya people still live in the Yucatan peninsula and parts of Central America...

02:50.691 --> 02:52.778
...and many have emigrated to Houston.

02:53.903 --> 02:59.751
Researchers have used their knowledge of modern Maya languages to decipher the ancient hieroglyphs...

03:00.069 --> 03:04.106
...and many top experts in this field are at the University of Texas.

03:04.462 --> 03:07.351
Van Tuerenhout says, they offer valuable insights.

03:07.737 --> 03:11.452
These ancient voices are speaking through these very few individuals...

03:11.545 --> 03:14.391
...who can read and decipher Maya writing.

03:15.024 --> 03:19.840
Van Tuerenhout says, the ancient Mayan sites continue to provide new information...

03:19.933 --> 03:23.611
...about the mysterious ancient civilization and its achievements.

03:25.002 --> 03:29.229
He says, the museum's goal is to show people that there is much more to the Maya...

03:29.453 --> 03:31.584
...than a spurious prediction of doom.
