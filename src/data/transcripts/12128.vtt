Superman is considered by many to be the cultural icon of the United States.

00:07.390 --> 00:10.491
Hi, welcome to WatchMojo.com. I'm your host Derrick Allen...

00:10.642 --> 00:14.147
...and today we'll be exploring this popular character's rich history.

00:14.341 --> 00:17.755
Over the years there has been several reimaginings of Superman...

00:17.881 --> 00:19.355
...and his alter ego Clark Kent.

00:19.597 --> 00:21.374
We have chosen just one of these.

00:21.642 --> 00:25.681
Born on the advanced alien planet Krypton to parents Jor-El and Lara,..

00:25.912 --> 00:28.297
...Superman's birth name is actually Kal-El.

00:28.470 --> 00:31.612
Upon learning of the planet Krypton's impending destruction,..

00:31.757 --> 00:35.385
...a young Kal-El is launched towards Earth by his biological parents.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.464
Shortly after, it is believed that the planet exploded...

00:38.569 --> 00:41.117
...due to a nuclear chain reaction within its core,...

00:41.324 --> 00:43.581
...leaving Kal-El as the last son of Krypton.

00:43.851 --> 00:48.494
Kal-El's spacecraft crashes and is found by Martha and Jonathan Kent in Smallville.

00:48.650 --> 00:51.936
The childless couple adopt the young boy and name him Clark Kent.

00:52.049 --> 00:53.668
It's only during his childhood...

00:53.845 --> 00:55.751
...that both the Kents and Clark himself...

00:55.884 --> 00:58.460
...begin to learn of his out of ordinary abilities.

00:58.679 --> 01:03.477
Super strength, flight and x-ray vision, are just a few of the superhuman powers...

01:03.566 --> 01:05.959
...that a young Clark Kent discovers while growing up.

01:06.361 --> 01:09.714
Encouraged by his adopted parents to use his powers responsibly,...

01:09.827 --> 01:12.147
...Clark chooses to create a secret identity,...

01:12.259 --> 01:14.437
...Superman as his means of fighting crime.

01:14.937 --> 01:18.797
Fearing enemies would discover his true identity and endanger his family and friends,...

01:18.886 --> 01:21.691
...Clark begins working as a reporter in the city of Metropolis...

01:21.811 --> 01:25.479
...and conceals his identity by wearing glasses, changing his hairstyle,...

01:25.560 --> 01:28.439
...as well as altering his voice and body language.
