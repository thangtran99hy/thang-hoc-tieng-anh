Do you love it, Dad?

00:01.857 --> 00:03.450
I thought you could use some help with your look...

00:03.465 --> 00:05.105
...'cause I'm kind of an expert on fashion.

00:05.120 --> 00:06.073
It's beautiful.

00:06.194 --> 00:06.770
What's this?

00:06.819 --> 00:09.410
Cologne. I smelled it in a magazine.

00:09.440 --> 00:10.830
Happy Father's Day!

00:10.840 --> 00:12.310
Thanks, Charlie.

00:13.920 --> 00:16.180
Dad, you're the perfectest!

00:16.300 --> 00:17.550
Love, Charlie.

00:19.820 --> 00:20.620
Cool, huh?

00:24.990 --> 00:27.930
This Father's Day, give the gift of your voice...

00:27.900 --> 00:29.000
...at your Hallmark Gold Crown Store.
