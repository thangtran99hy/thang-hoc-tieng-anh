Copy and paste lets you take text from one place and put it somewhere else.

00:05.099 --> 00:09.361
For instance, say you're on a website and there's a really great paragraph that you want to send.

00:09.985 --> 00:12.759
Select the paragraph by clicking before the first word,...

00:13.123 --> 00:14.453
...holding the mouse button down,...

00:14.827 --> 00:18.327
...and then dragging the mouse until just after the last word in the paragraph.

00:19.097 --> 00:22.025
All the text will become highlighted so you'll know it's selected.

00:22.729 --> 00:25.203
Next, you have to tell your computer that you want to copy it.

00:26.039 --> 00:28.295
Click on the edit menu from the top of your screen,...

00:28.855 --> 00:29.979
...then select copy.

00:31.008 --> 00:33.497
Now the paragraph is stored and ready to be pasted.

00:34.193 --> 00:37.425
Next, open up your e-mail and compose a new message.

00:38.286 --> 00:40.265
Click your mouse where you want to paste the text,...

00:40.754 --> 00:44.353
...then click on edit at the top of the screen, and then select paste.

00:44.941 --> 00:47.845
And voila! The paragraph has now been copied and pasted.

00:48.816 --> 00:51.893
I hope this helps, and I look forward to getting e-mails from you soon.
