00:01.303 --> 00:02.653
Now, lend me your ears.

00:03.354 --> 00:05.969
This is how to write a good short story:...

00:07.953 --> 00:14.089
One, use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.

00:16.026 --> 00:20.199
Two, give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.

00:22.138 --> 00:27.491
Three, every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.

00:29.410 --> 00:32.748
Four, every sentence must do one of two things,...

00:33.332 --> 00:35.829
...reveal character or advance the action.

00:37.744 --> 00:41.091
Five, start as close to the end as possible.

00:43.025 --> 00:44.830
Six, be a sadist.

00:45.071 --> 00:47.557
No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters,...

00:47.834 --> 00:49.713
...make awful things happen to them...

00:49.903 --> 00:53.027
...in order that the reader may see what they are made of.

00:54.961 --> 00:57.726
Seven, write to please just one person.

00:58.233 --> 01:01.158
If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak,...

01:01.608 --> 01:03.188
...your story will get pneumonia.

01:05.138 --> 01:10.437
Eight, give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible.

01:11.230 --> 01:12.667
To heck with suspense.

01:13.311 --> 01:17.972
Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why,...
