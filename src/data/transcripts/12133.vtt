How to Colonize a New Planet.

00:06.267 --> 00:09.987
Now that scientists have discovered evidence of thousands of other planets,...

00:10.151 --> 00:13.364
...the next question is obviously, how can we colonize them?

00:14.109 --> 00:18.711
Keep these considerations in mind to become a colonial power of galactic proportion.

00:19.641 --> 00:22.774
You will need: a planet in the Goldilocks zone,...

00:23.883 --> 00:26.891
...speedy spaceships, outer space fertility,...

00:27.663 --> 00:30.619
...man - made biospheres and terraforming.

00:31.416 --> 00:35.241
Step 1: Target a planet in the so-called Goldilocks zone,...

00:35.488 --> 00:40.291
...close enough to a sun so temperatures are neither too hot nor too cold but just right.

00:40.876 --> 00:43.723
This ensures that water would be available in liquid form.

00:44.231 --> 00:47.113
Step 2: Figure out how to get there in this lifetime.

00:47.549 --> 00:49.229
Most planets are light-years away.

00:49.776 --> 00:52.132
Circumventing the speed of light would be a good start.

00:52.907 --> 00:56.347
Step 3: If possible, pick an uninhabited land.

00:56.837 --> 01:00.459
It's much easier to colonize a new planet without any alien life forms...

01:00.529 --> 01:03.289
...who could very well outsmart and overpower earthlings.

01:04.459 --> 01:08.602
Renowned astrophysicist Stephen Hawking said that alien life is likely.

01:09.581 --> 01:12.391
Step 4: Protect human fertilization.

01:13.152 --> 01:16.358
Scientists investigating the feasibility of colonizing Mars...

01:16.460 --> 01:20.537
...found that high levels of radiation in space would make pregnancy problematic.

01:20.837 --> 01:24.710
And negative population growth makes a planet pretty hard to colonize.

01:25.658 --> 01:27.409
Step 5: Build housing:...

01:27.902 --> 01:31.367
...man - made biospheres that allow people to survive on the new planet...

01:31.463 --> 01:33.761
...by providing closed ecological systems.

01:34.229 --> 01:36.117
Step 6: Start terraforming:...

01:36.519 --> 01:40.723
...changing the new planet's environment so earthlings can live outside their biospheres.

01:41.141 --> 01:43.385
Then, try not to pollute it so soon!

01:44.138 --> 01:44.660
Did you know?

01:45.132 --> 01:48.249
Scientists believe that as many as half the stars in our galaxy...

01:48.345 --> 01:52.438
...have planets that are two to ten times the size of Earth and may sustain life.
