My name is John Farnworth, I'm 25.

00:02.613 --> 00:05.230
I'm a football freestyler from Preston, in the UK.

00:11.725 --> 00:14.650
I got into football freestyle in 2003,...

00:14.723 --> 00:18.197
...and it was something that I didn't really know much about to begin with.

00:18.377 --> 00:20.123
And it was just very exciting to watch,...

00:20.267 --> 00:21.554
...something that was quite cool.

00:22.215 --> 00:24.524
Yeah, freestyle just stood out to me 'cause it was so different...

00:25.131 --> 00:28.439
...and there was so much freedom and creativity that could be achieved...

00:28.753 --> 00:29.980
...so that's about what it means, really.

00:30.564 --> 00:31.998
I'm looking to do this professionally...

00:32.015 --> 00:33.850
...so that actually includes a lot of traveling,...

00:33.929 --> 00:37.000
...be in a lot of shows and appearances, so I train as much as possible...

00:37.031 --> 00:38.070
...for every single day.

00:39.869 --> 00:42.000
It's hard to say like the one, hardest trick.

00:42.051 --> 00:44.632
I mean there's probably a bunch of tricks that are slightly harder.

00:45.374 --> 00:48.048
And I mean, the trick which took me longest to learn...

00:48.115 --> 00:50.469
...which is probably jiggling the ball on the soles of my feet,...

00:50.559 --> 00:53.000
...which I can do really comfortably now.

00:53.010 --> 00:55.989
But it took probably about six months of just practicing...

00:56.024 --> 00:59.659
...to get it very comfortable to actually then do it in front of lots of people.

01:01.770 --> 01:05.465
I currently hold the world record for most amounts of around the worlds in a minute,...

01:05.757 --> 01:08.218
...which is 85 just around the world with the trick,...

01:08.396 --> 01:09.726
...quite a popular trick in freestyle.

01:10.524 --> 01:13.106
Also, the most amount of shin jiggles in a minute,...

01:13.169 --> 01:17.677
...which is 107, also the amount of heel jiggles in one minute...

01:17.739 --> 01:20.241
...also jiggling the ball on my heel, 133.

01:20.713 --> 01:23.716
And the last one is the most amount of face rolls,...

01:23.787 --> 01:25.791
...which is 559.

01:26.052 --> 01:29.055
I recently jiggled the ball around the whole London marathon,..

01:29.105 --> 01:31.157
...which is something I've always actually wanted to do.

01:31.571 --> 01:33.927
To do it was amazing, especially in England to do it,...

01:34.385 --> 01:37.622
...with all my support and English people around me, so it was good.

01:38.827 --> 01:41.000
It's such an honor really.

01:41.078 --> 01:42.168
I mean, when I was younger,...

01:42.180 --> 01:43.690
..even though I didn't get into freestyle...

01:43.700 --> 01:45.338
... I knew about Guinness World Records then.

01:45.631 --> 01:47.516
I always said like, "I wanted to have a world record."

01:47.655 --> 01:49.041
I didn't know what it was gonna be in.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.580
But when the opportunity arose in freestyle to have a world record...

01:52.664 --> 01:56.600
...then I took the opportunity because it's just amazing to be part...

01:56.611 --> 01:58.042
...of such a famous thing.
