The mood of the city today is really happy.

00:05.417 --> 00:08.287
It's really vibrant 'cause the sun's shining...

00:08.365 --> 00:14.815
...and everyone's really happy and bouncy which is a lovely surprise for October.

00:19.250 --> 00:24.449
I love the drive across any of the bridges going along the South Bank.

00:25.374 --> 00:29.163
I love driving around through that part of London like around Westminster...

00:29.747 --> 00:33.565
...and around the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey.

00:33.655 --> 00:34.920
I just think it's all so beautiful.

00:35.010 --> 00:36.442
And then you get the water too, which...

00:36.959 --> 00:38.510
...I love being near water.

00:42.191 --> 00:46.888
I think the people in London make me the most proud of the city.

00:47.433 --> 00:49.795
I think what comes out of it is such great music...

00:49.885 --> 00:55.515
...and such great art and such great films and such great fashion.

00:55.600 --> 01:00.301
I think that London's really a sum of its parts.

01:03.719 --> 01:07.501
When I'm ever away from my city I miss roast dinners.

01:08.165 --> 01:09.156
I miss going to the park.

01:10.465 --> 01:14.808
And yeah, I miss the spirit of Londoners when I'm away.
