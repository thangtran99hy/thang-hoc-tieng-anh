The thing that inspires me about London is the diversity.

00:06.424 --> 00:11.015
I love that eclectic mix of different cultures sort of clashing together...

00:11.100 --> 00:15.754
...in the heart of what is such a pacy and fast, vibrant environment.

00:19.327 --> 00:23.204
My perfect drive through my city, or in my city always starts very early.

00:23.332 --> 00:27.517
I used to have a ridiculously early drive to work at about half past three in the morning.

00:27.792 --> 00:30.683
And I'd love coming in on the A4, through Kensington,...

00:30.902 --> 00:33.693
...go past the Natural History Museum, the back of the Royal Albert Hall...

00:34.301 --> 00:35.983
Christmas, when the lights are in the trees.

00:36.323 --> 00:37.863
It's really, really atmospheric.

00:38.261 --> 00:41.669
Keep heading in past Harrods which should all be lit up through Knight's Bridge...

00:42.043 --> 00:44.589
...up to Hyde Park corner. Yeah, Hyde Park corner.

00:44.895 --> 00:48.106
Go round the back of the Queen's House, down Birdcage Walk,...

00:48.545 --> 00:49.701
...towards Parliament Square,...

00:49.943 --> 00:54.255
...and of that sense of history and tradition as soon as you see Big Ben,...

00:54.330 --> 00:56.735
...and Parliament, the House of Parliament, Parliament Square.

00:57.034 --> 01:00.155
And the juxtaposition of all the protesters that are camping out...

01:00.239 --> 01:02.413
...that have been on Parliament Green for such a long time.

01:02.491 --> 01:06.135
And then, the best bit for me, always, and I still get a thrill when I do this now...

01:06.228 --> 01:07.325
...is driving over the river.

01:07.777 --> 01:11.509
Particularly on a really still morning, and you can barely see the Thames moving.

01:12.261 --> 01:14.530
That is still my favorite drive through the city.

01:18.464 --> 01:23.013
The things that make me proud of my city is this rich history and this fantastic tapestry we've got.

01:23.482 --> 01:25.375
The juxtaposition of the architecture...

01:25.769 --> 01:29.435
...and going back hundreds of years in these extraordinary buildings,...

01:29.595 --> 01:32.901
...and next to them these, sort of, the futuristic buildings of the city.

01:33.485 --> 01:36.269
I love the higgledy-piggledy nature of it as well.

01:36.361 --> 01:39.477
I love the fact that our city was never designed for this many people.

01:39.630 --> 01:44.123
It's the unknown quantity and the unknown quality of London that makes it so special.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.527
The fact that you drive down a road and you just think,...

01:46.929 --> 01:48.475
...I've no idea where this road's gonna come out,...

01:48.566 --> 01:50.705
...and you end up discovering something brand new.

01:51.163 --> 01:54.000
And that's exactly what makes me proud of this city,...

01:54.241 --> 01:56.063
...is the exciting hidden qualities.
