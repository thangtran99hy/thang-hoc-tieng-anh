Dear Lord, thank you for the food we are about to eat.

00:16.113 --> 00:21.531
Please use your mighty power to stop the melting of the polar ice caps. Amen.

00:29.608 --> 00:30.327
Could you pass the salt?

00:31.195 --> 00:31.630
I'll get it.

00:33.484 --> 00:35.984
I'm not coming in to work today 'cause I have a pest problem.

00:36.741 --> 00:37.769
Oh, hey!

00:38.555 --> 00:39.798
Penguins, yes!

00:41.691 --> 00:42.535
I don't like you.

00:43.919 --> 00:44.806
I don't need you.

00:46.423 --> 00:47.829
I don't want you in my life!

00:48.748 --> 00:49.700
Pull yourself together.

00:50.669 --> 00:52.529
Your house is full of penguins.

00:52.693 --> 00:53.471
I know!

01:00.569 --> 01:04.619
And, shuffle, ball, step. Shuffle, ball, lunge.

01:05.373 --> 01:06.343
Step, ball, change,...

01:06.410 --> 01:07.285
...step, ball, change,...

01:07.358 --> 01:08.375
...step, ball, change,...

01:08.968 --> 01:09.671
...word.

01:10.978 --> 01:11.865
Word to your mother.
