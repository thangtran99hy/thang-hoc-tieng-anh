00:00.487 --> 00:00.911
Yes?

00:01.573 --> 00:06.711
I was just wondering what advice you would give young people who are considering careers as writers?

00:09.465 --> 00:10.755
I guess we should buy your book.

00:12.332 --> 00:15.237
Well, I think you ought to read a lot and I think you ought to write a lot.

00:15.529 --> 00:19.249
And those are really the two major things; you can't put it off.

00:21.567 --> 00:22.992
You have to really do the work.

00:24.623 --> 00:25.637
You have to be well-read.

00:25.710 --> 00:27.744
I don't have any patience with people who say,...

00:27.967 --> 00:30.571
..."Oh man, I wanna be a writer but I don't have time to read."

00:30.645 --> 00:34.100
But if you don't have time to read, you can't be a writer.

00:34.481 --> 00:36.335
You've got to read just about everything.

00:37.065 --> 00:39.086
So, I think that's the most important thing...

00:39.179 --> 00:41.719
...and then you have to read.

00:42.758 --> 00:46.873
I mean, you have to write in order to develop a style and create a style of your own.

00:46.944 --> 00:50.886
When it comes to the reading part of it, there's a magic moment...

00:51.316 --> 00:52.618
...a really magic moment.

00:52.730 --> 00:56.753
If you read enough, it will always come to you if you wanna be a writer...

00:57.402 --> 01:02.775
...where you put down some book and say, "This really sucked."

01:05.001 --> 01:07.239
"I can do better than this."

01:09.131 --> 01:10.437
"And this got published!"
