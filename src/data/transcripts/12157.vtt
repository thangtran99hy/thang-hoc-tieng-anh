First candy bars, then butter. Fried beer was inevitable.

00:09.617 --> 00:11.611
Here's how to get two American favorites,...

00:11.907 --> 00:15.746
...beer and deep - fried dough in one finger-lickin' good package.

00:16.423 --> 00:20.493
You will need one tablespoon yeast, one cup lukewarm water,...

00:20.890 --> 00:25.515
...one tablespoon sugar, three and a half cups flour, a third cup butter,...

00:25.975 --> 00:30.731
...one teaspoon salt, three eggs, beer, and two cups vegetable oil.

00:31.669 --> 00:32.219
Equipment:...

00:32.535 --> 00:34.563
...a rolling pin, a ravioli cutter,...

00:35.093 --> 00:38.143
...a candy and oil thermometer, and a slotted spoon.

00:39.498 --> 00:44.609
Step one: Make pretzel dough by combining the yeast, water, and sugar until they dissolve.

00:45.109 --> 00:49.207
Then beat in one cup of the flour and let the mixture stand until it's frothy.

00:49.758 --> 00:52.735
Finally, add the salt, butter, and the rest of the flour,...

00:53.094 --> 00:55.469
...and knead the dough until the butter is distributed.

00:56.403 --> 00:59.426
Step two: Roll out the dough into thin sheets.

00:59.701 --> 01:02.521
Beat the eggs together and brush the sheets with egg...

01:02.797 --> 01:06.524
...and then use the ravioli cutter to press ravioli shapes out of the dough.

01:07.336 --> 01:11.140
Step three: Pair the shapes and press them together on three sides,...

01:11.489 --> 01:12.933
...egg wash sides facing.

01:13.359 --> 01:17.267
Use your thumb to hold the pocket open while you press the sides together.

01:17.987 --> 01:24.202
Step four: Prop the raviolis against each other with the open end up and pour beer into the pockets.

01:24.933 --> 01:28.600
Then, press the open ends closed to seal the beer inside.

01:29.337 --> 01:35.921
Step five: Heat the oil in a pan until it measures 325Â°F on the thermometer.

01:36.249 --> 01:40.485
Then, in small batches, fry the ravioli for about 20 seconds.

01:41.145 --> 01:47.389
Step six: Use the slotted spoon to remove the fried ravioli to paper towels to soak up excess oil.

01:47.810 --> 01:51.861
Allow them to cool for a few minutes and pop a shot of deep - fried beer.

01:52.384 --> 01:56.938
Did you know the Miller Brewing Company was founded in 1855...

01:57.117 --> 02:01.816
...when Frederick J. Miller bought the Plank Road Brewery in Milwaukee, Wisconsin?
