Hi, I'm George Takei.

00:03.049 --> 00:06.115
A bill recently approved by Tennessee Senate Committee...

00:06.402 --> 00:11.482
...would prohibit teachers in that state from discussing homosexuality in the classroom.

00:11.913 --> 00:16.944
The so-called "Don't Say Gay" law is premised on the misguided belief that...

00:17.280 --> 00:21.358
...by not talking about gay people they can simply make us disappear.

00:21.791 --> 00:25.255
I'm here to tell Tennessee and all LGBT youth...

00:25.583 --> 00:28.061
...and teachers who would be affected by this law...

00:28.370 --> 00:29.993
...that I am here for you.

00:30.125 --> 00:33.444
In fact, I'm lending my name to the cause.

00:33.935 --> 00:38.727
Anytime you need to say the word "gay", you can simply say "Takei."

00:39.055 --> 00:43.739
For example, you could safely proclaim you are supportive of Takei marriage.

00:44.207 --> 00:49.457
If you are in a more festive mood, you can march in a Takei pride parade.

00:50.337 --> 00:54.423
Even homophobic slurs don't seem as hurtful if someone says,...

00:54.931 --> 00:57.423
..."That is so Takei!"

00:58.128 --> 01:00.072
And around the holidays you can sing,...

01:00.355 --> 01:03.291
..."Don we now our Takei apparel."

01:03.583 --> 01:07.425
Speaking of apparel, I've created a t-shirt,...

01:07.733 --> 01:09.854
..."It's okay to be Takei."

01:10.155 --> 01:11.893
I hope you wear it proudly.

01:12.116 --> 01:14.797
We also have buttons, mouse pads, and mugs...

01:15.044 --> 01:17.677
...all in time for Takei Pride Month.

01:18.097 --> 01:21.262
And all proceeds go to charity. Thank you.

01:21.644 --> 01:23.459
And as they say on the Flintstones,...

01:23.878 --> 01:25.911
..."Have a Takei old time!"
