00:11.803 --> 00:12.719
Please don't!

00:15.749 --> 00:17.452
In a city gripped by fear...

00:17.714 --> 00:19.915
Should I be concerned for my safety?

00:20.001 --> 00:22.043
A woman should always be concerned for her safety.

00:22.130 --> 00:22.921
It's a nasty world.

00:23.264 --> 00:24.317
...three neighbors...

00:24.516 --> 00:27.231
I'm Victor, nice to meet you. Spencer, Louise.

00:27.692 --> 00:29.356
...are getting to know each other.

00:29.516 --> 00:31.521
Car accident. Last winter, my wife died.

00:34.215 --> 00:35.094
Three dead and raped.

00:35.921 --> 00:37.154
There's a lot more detail there.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.334
Why do you think you're so interested in all this stuff?

00:40.699 --> 00:42.099
When everyone is a suspect,...

00:42.848 --> 00:43.541
Were you alone?

00:43.780 --> 00:47.015
Yeah. No! No, no. Louise, you were here with me.

00:47.731 --> 00:50.745
...they'll discover that the real danger isn't on the street,...

00:51.447 --> 00:53.292
...it's much closer to home.

00:53.481 --> 00:55.327
You don't get a serial rapist vibe off of him?

01:07.729 --> 01:12.155
I'm so sorry. It's pitch-black outside, you're coming home by yourself and I just leap out.

01:13.229 --> 01:15.755
I saw him, walking outside that night.

01:16.704 --> 01:18.755
I think we have a common problem, Louise: Victor.

01:19.179 --> 01:21.159
Just moved back to town. He's lonely.

01:22.451 --> 01:23.377
Where were you last Tuesday night?

01:23.615 --> 01:23.761
Home.

01:24.193 --> 01:25.871
How come you didn't tell me you knew that last victim?

01:33.429 --> 01:34.821
Wait, what's going on exactly?

01:35.888 --> 01:36.563
You tell me.

01:39.043 --> 01:39.549
Hi there.

01:42.386 --> 01:43.753
Do you ever like dancing?

01:44.091 --> 01:45.036
I always like watching.

01:45.493 --> 01:46.809
Something's going on with these people.

01:47.773 --> 01:50.111
He's just waiting for any chance to get rid of me.

01:51.486 --> 01:52.617
I have a surprise for you.

01:52.976 --> 01:55.708
Oh, Louise! You always wanna see the best in people, don't you?

02:09.591 --> 02:10.179
Louise?
