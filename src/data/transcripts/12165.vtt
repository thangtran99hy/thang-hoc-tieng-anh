00:07.504 --> 00:10.185
It's an incredible story of survival.

00:10.509 --> 00:16.603
Nearly three weeks ago, this dog Mason was picked up by a tornado that ravaged Alabama.

00:16.863 --> 00:19.914
His owners frantically searched for their beloved dog,...

00:20.077 --> 00:21.621
...but began to give up hope.

00:22.101 --> 00:25.969
Then on Monday, they returned to what was left of their home...

00:26.161 --> 00:29.490
...and found their terrier mix waiting on the porch.

00:29.656 --> 00:36.433
He's got two broken legs and they're distal radioulnar fractures.

00:36.851 --> 00:41.067
They've not been able to be in alignment so neither one of them have healed,...

00:41.408 --> 00:45.653
...so he had to crawl on two broken legs to get home.

00:45.847 --> 00:50.063
Mason's owners have asked a local animal shelter to take care of him...

00:50.328 --> 00:53.350
...while they try to put their own lives back together.

00:53.570 --> 00:55.967
This is probably the most dramatic that we've seen...

00:56.084 --> 00:58.706
...as far as an injury in an animal that's survived this long.

00:59.117 --> 01:03.305
And an animal clinic has volunteered to help nurse him back to health.

01:03.533 --> 01:06.701
He called and asked if there was anything he could do last week...

01:06.827 --> 01:13.254
...and this dog appeared today and so I called him and never a hesitation,...

01:13.380 --> 01:15.661
...he offered, "Bring it on over." and he'd do what he could do.

01:15.837 --> 01:19.001
Mason will have surgery on his broken legs, Friday.

01:19.175 --> 01:22.055
Doctors say while his recovery will be long,...

01:22.342 --> 01:25.279
...ultimately they believe that will be successful.

01:25.417 --> 01:29.858
For an animal to go what he's gone through and not to be ugly,...

01:29.951 --> 01:34.115
...to be, you know, happy for human companionship is remarkable...

01:34.228 --> 01:36.529
...and we're honored to be a part of his recovery.

01:36.711 --> 01:38.773
A true survivor indeed.
