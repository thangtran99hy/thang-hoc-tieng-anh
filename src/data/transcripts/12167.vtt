00:00.043 --> 00:03.555
You've got to take risks. And I'm sure you've probably heard that before.

00:03.876 --> 00:06.537
But I wanna talk to you about why that's so important.

00:07.788 --> 00:10.889
I've got three reasons and you can pick up your iPhones.

00:12.793 --> 00:17.431
First, you will fail at some point in your life.

00:17.507 --> 00:18.011
Accept it.

00:18.437 --> 00:19.399
You will lose.

00:19.616 --> 00:21.075
You will embarrass yourself.

00:21.323 --> 00:22.944
You will suck at something.

00:23.361 --> 00:24.313
There's no doubt about it.

00:25.379 --> 00:29.066
And I know that's probably not a traditional message for a graduation ceremony,...

00:29.154 --> 00:31.736
...but hey, I'm telling you, embrace it...

00:32.038 --> 00:33.053
...because it's inevitable.

00:34.576 --> 00:37.085
The point is, and I'll pick up the pace.

00:37.758 --> 00:43.261
The point is, every graduate here today has the training and the talent to succeed.

00:43.966 --> 00:46.356
But do you have the guts to fail?

00:46.968 --> 00:48.294
Here's my second point about failure,...

00:48.717 --> 00:52.439
...if you don't fail, you're not even trying.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.292
I'll say it again.

00:55.601 --> 00:57.993
If you don't fail, you're not even trying.

00:58.090 --> 00:59.597
My wife told me this great expression,...

01:00.058 --> 01:04.833
..."To get something you never had, you have to do something you never did."

01:05.849 --> 01:08.995
Les Brown's a motivational speaker. He made an analogy about this.

01:09.375 --> 01:11.118
He says, imagine you're on your deathbed...

01:11.463 --> 01:16.621
...and standing around your deathbed are the ghosts representing your unfulfilled potential.

01:17.159 --> 01:19.616
The ghosts of the ideas you never acted on.

01:20.021 --> 01:22.327
The ghosts of the talents you didn't use.

01:22.627 --> 01:24.322
And they're standing around your bed,...

01:24.645 --> 01:27.222
...angry, disappointed and upset.

01:28.086 --> 01:32.931
They say, "We came to you because you could have brought us to life," they say.

01:33.697 --> 01:35.816
"And now we have to go to the grave together."

01:36.232 --> 01:37.415
So I ask you today.

01:39.502 --> 01:42.564
How many ghosts are gonna be around your bed when your time comes?

01:44.308 --> 01:47.851
Because taking risk is not just about going for a job.

01:48.555 --> 01:52.021
It's also about knowing what you know and what you don't know.

01:52.649 --> 01:56.850
It's about being open to people and to ideas.

01:58.481 --> 02:01.463
And I can't think of a better message as we send you off today.

02:02.694 --> 02:06.812
To not only take risks, but to be open to life.

02:07.297 --> 02:10.908
To accept new views and to be open to new opinions.

02:11.655 --> 02:16.931
To be willing to speak at a commencement at one of the best universities in the country...

02:17.193 --> 02:18.451
...even though you're scared stiff.

02:18.530 --> 02:21.667
While it may be frightening, it will also be rewarding.

02:23.012 --> 02:26.340
Because the chances you take, the people you meet,...

02:26.871 --> 02:30.281
...the people you love, the faith that you have,...

02:30.935 --> 02:32.522
...that's what's going to define you.
