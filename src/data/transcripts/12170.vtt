00:01.067 --> 00:03.413
Doctors have discovered something incredible.

00:03.912 --> 00:07.057
They found a way to reverse type two diabetes.

00:07.516 --> 00:12.741
Bariatric surgery is an umbrella term for different surgeries that make the stomach smaller.

00:13.344 --> 00:16.291
One in particular, gastric bypass surgery,...

00:16.599 --> 00:20.743
...reverses type two diabetes in up to 80 percent of the patients.

00:21.385 --> 00:27.694
Dr. Phil Schauer at the Cleveland Clinic says afterwards, patients can literally throw away their insulin.

00:28.004 --> 00:31.573
Before they leave the hospital, they will never use insulin again.

00:31.974 --> 00:38.099
Before her surgery, Katy Wiley suffered from complications from diabetes for 16 years.

00:38.469 --> 00:42.569
It was horrible. Diabetes controlled my life.

00:43.023 --> 00:48.336
Some doctors are now promoting gastric bypass surgery as a way to control diabetes.

00:48.578 --> 00:50.341
Bariatric surgery has been shown...

00:50.664 --> 00:54.955
...to be able to bring blood sugar under control more effectively...

00:55.521 --> 00:58.428
...than other intervention such as dietary intervention.

00:58.885 --> 01:03.428
And we don't have a complete explanation for that phenomenon.

01:03.844 --> 01:09.298
Professor Christopher Newgard at Duke University and other researchers at Columbia University...

01:09.704 --> 01:13.171
...began looking for chemical changes in the body's metabolism.

01:13.701 --> 01:16.709
They looked at one group of diabetics who had the surgery...

01:17.110 --> 01:20.255
...and another group who lost weight through diet and exercise.

01:20.756 --> 01:22.865
Both groups lost the same amount of weight.

01:23.437 --> 01:27.467
Then the researchers analyzed the chemical differences in the patients' blood.

01:27.973 --> 01:31.693
And we found there indeed, there was a very clear difference...

01:31.854 --> 01:36.582
...in the chemical response to weight loss by those two different interventions.

01:36.939 --> 01:41.893
Those who had the surgery had fewer insulin - resisting amino acids in their blood.

01:42.311 --> 01:45.053
Amino acids are building blocks for protein.

01:45.387 --> 01:49.936
But some types prevent the body from using insulin to control blood sugar levels.

01:50.571 --> 01:55.127
These particular amino acids are called branched chain amino acids.

01:55.463 --> 02:00.083
What are some of the things that we have found about branched chain amino acids in the last couple of years,...

02:00.570 --> 02:03.379
...strongly associated with insulin resistance,...

02:05.187 --> 02:11.920
...strongly associated or strongly predictive of imminent diabetes risk,...

02:13.014 --> 02:18.728
...and then strongly responsive to an intervention which we know to be...

02:19.537 --> 02:24.851
...very efficient for improving blood glucose homeostasis and that is bariatric surgery.

02:25.240 --> 02:30.743
At this time, bariatric surgery is the most effective way of reversing type two diabetes.

02:31.225 --> 02:36.625
But doctors hope, with more research, drugs can be developed to control those amino acids...

02:36.975 --> 02:38.495
...and reverse this disease.
