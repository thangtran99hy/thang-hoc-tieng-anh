00:00.541 --> 00:03.803
Nikola Tesla was born on July 10th, 1856...

00:03.877 --> 00:07.945
...in the territory of modern day Croatia to his two Serbian parents.

00:08.165 --> 00:11.521
Tesla grew up into a bright, inquisitive, yet eccentric child...

00:11.735 --> 00:14.144
...who found himself fascinated by the world around him.

00:14.377 --> 00:18.195
Tesla once attempted to generate electricity by rubbing two cats together,...

00:18.425 --> 00:21.732
...which resulted in two very mad cats and a scratched up Tesla.

00:22.201 --> 00:26.047
On June 6th, 1884, Tesla arrived in the United States.

00:26.506 --> 00:29.779
He was hired by Thomas Edison to do basic electrical engineering,...

00:30.014 --> 00:34.078
...but moved up to redesigning the direct current generators that ran Edison's business.

00:34.449 --> 00:38.902
Tesla eventually left Edison's company and partnered with George Westinghouse in 1888...

00:39.200 --> 00:41.529
...to commercialize his system of alternating current.

00:41.747 --> 00:44.898
The problem here is that alternating current competed with direct current,...

00:45.069 --> 00:47.496
...which Thomas Edison built his entire monopoly on.

00:47.797 --> 00:49.828
Thus began the War of the Currents.

00:50.124 --> 00:52.751
Tesla's influence spreads much further than electricity.

00:52.966 --> 00:56.023
He had over 700 patents and came up with ideas...

00:56.109 --> 00:59.015
...such as robots, spark plugs, the electric arc lamp,...

00:59.079 --> 01:00.994
...an X-ray device, bladeless turbines,...

01:01.087 --> 01:04.007
...wireless communication, laser technology, neon lights,...

01:04.081 --> 01:06.333
...remote controls, cellular communication, the radio,...

01:06.416 --> 01:09.772
...an electrical bath to remove germs, radar, and much more.

01:10.045 --> 01:12.047
Despite his fame and influence on the world,...

01:12.222 --> 01:14.477
...he died with significant debts and all alone.

01:14.744 --> 01:16.977
While Edison is known as the inventor of the century,...

01:17.173 --> 01:20.497
...Tesla is only acknowledged as a paragraph in today's history books:...

01:20.817 --> 01:22.471
...forgotten and unappreciated.

01:23.313 --> 01:27.344
Thus ends the story of Nikola Tesla, genius and inventor.
