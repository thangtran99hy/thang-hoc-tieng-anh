00:00.723 --> 00:04.912
Bayeux, with a pleasant town center and only six miles from the D-Day beaches,...

00:05.094 --> 00:07.969
...makes a great home base for visiting the area's sites.

00:10.826 --> 00:13.724
Along the 75 miles of Atlantic coast nearby,...

00:14.041 --> 00:18.331
...you'll find countless memories of the largest military operation in history.

00:20.013 --> 00:24.983
It was on these beautiful beaches at the crack of dawn, June 6, 1944,...

00:25.323 --> 00:27.982
...that the Allies finally gained the foothold in France...

00:28.381 --> 00:30.359
...and Nazi Europe began to crumble.

00:32.080 --> 00:35.427
During the D-Day invasion, American troops and their Allied partners...

00:35.623 --> 00:40.496
...courageously assaulted the German-occupied cliffs using grappling hooks and ladders.

00:41.451 --> 00:44.739
While ultimately victorious, they suffered horrendous losses.

00:48.483 --> 00:51.458
Smashed German bunkers and bomb craters remain,...

00:51.785 --> 00:56.725
...only hinting at the unimaginable carnage and chaos of that momentous day.

00:59.769 --> 01:03.404
The small town of Arromanches was ground zero for the D-Day invasion.

01:04.044 --> 01:07.591
Almost overnight, the Allies erected an immense prefab port,...

01:07.827 --> 01:10.875
...enabling them to begin their victorious push to Berlin.

01:11.765 --> 01:13.921
Imagine the building of this incredible harbor.

01:14.475 --> 01:18.362
Seventeen old ships steamed across the English Channel and were sunk bow to stern,...

01:18.487 --> 01:20.563
...creating a four-mile-long protective breakwater.

01:21.098 --> 01:26.367
Then, with massive concrete platforms and roads floating on pontoons nearly a mile long,...

01:26.735 --> 01:27.937
...the harbor was completed.

01:28.419 --> 01:31.754
Within six days, 300,000 Allied troops and all their equipment...

01:31.860 --> 01:33.601
...had established a beachhead here in France.

01:33.948 --> 01:36.076
And less than a year later, the war was over.

01:37.261 --> 01:40.561
Today, 60 years later, the town, with its beachcombers,...

01:40.724 --> 01:42.738
...holiday trinkets and families at play,...

01:43.229 --> 01:45.728
...still seems to celebrate that Allied victory.
