00:12.978 --> 00:13.784
When I was a child,...

00:14.100 --> 00:15.558
...I always wanted to be a superhero.

00:15.687 --> 00:18.695
I wanted to save the world and then make everyone happy.

00:19.267 --> 00:22.541
But I knew that I'd need super powers to make my dreams come true.

00:23.989 --> 00:24.613
When I grew up...

00:25.058 --> 00:28.284
...and realized that science fiction was not the good source for super powers...

00:28.777 --> 00:32.065
...I decided instead, to embark on a journey of real science...

00:32.189 --> 00:33.569
...to find a more useful truth.

00:34.435 --> 00:39.515
I started my journey in California with a UC Berkeley 30 - year longitudinal study.

00:39.761 --> 00:41.429
By measuring their students' smiles,...

00:41.550 --> 00:43.237
...researchers were able to predict...

00:43.693 --> 00:47.577
...how fulfilling and long - lasting a subject's marriage will be,...

00:48.771 --> 00:52.543
...how well she would score in standardized tests of well-being,...

00:52.898 --> 00:55.186
...and how inspiring she would be to others.

00:56.379 --> 00:57.101
In another yearbook,...

00:57.227 --> 00:59.287
...I stumbled upon Barry Obama's picture.

01:00.107 --> 01:03.119
When I first saw his picture, I thought that his super powers came from his...

01:03.445 --> 01:04.350
...super collar.

01:05.909 --> 01:07.739
But now I know it was all in his smile.

01:08.837 --> 01:12.777
Another "aha!" moment came from a 2010 Wayne State University...

01:13.251 --> 01:18.302
...research project that looked into pre - 1950s baseball cards of Major League players.

01:18.577 --> 01:23.719
Players who didn't smile in their pictures lived an average of only 72.9 years,...

01:24.100 --> 01:28.758
...whereas players with beaming smiles lived an average of almost 80 years.

01:31.307 --> 01:33.845
The good news is that we're actually born smiling.

01:34.323 --> 01:36.833
When they're born, babies continue to smile...

01:37.021 --> 01:38.813
...initially, mostly in their sleep.

01:39.318 --> 01:43.303
And even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice.

01:43.498 --> 01:48.241
Smiling is one of the most basic, biologically uniform expressions of all humans.

01:48.403 --> 01:51.667
So whenever you wanna look great and competent, reduce your stress...

01:52.127 --> 01:53.315
... or improve your marriage...

01:53.557 --> 01:56.793
...or whenever you want to tap into a super power...

01:57.161 --> 02:00.945
...that will help you and everyone around you live a longer,...

02:01.187 --> 02:04.273
...healthier, happier life, smile.
