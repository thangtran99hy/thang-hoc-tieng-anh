00:12.875 --> 00:15.030
Why do I do so much stuff that involves mystery?

00:15.182 --> 00:16.329
And I started trying to figure it out.

00:16.491 --> 00:19.046
And I started thinking about why do I do any of what I do,...

00:19.193 --> 00:20.473
...and I started thinking about my grandfather.

00:21.231 --> 00:24.995
I loved my grandfather, Harry Kelvin.

00:25.605 --> 00:26.565
As a kid I saw him...

00:26.973 --> 00:29.764
...come over to me with radios and telephones and all sorts of things.

00:29.906 --> 00:33.143
And he'd open them up: he'd unscrew them and reveal the inner workings...

00:33.259 --> 00:35.295
...which many of us I'm sure, take for granted.

00:35.391 --> 00:38.149
But it's an amazing gift to give a kid:...

00:38.291 --> 00:42.123
...to open up this thing and show how it works and why it works and what it is.

00:42.469 --> 00:45.271
He was the ultimate deconstructor in many ways.

00:45.431 --> 00:48.225
When I was a kid, I was always, like, taking apart...

00:49.386 --> 00:50.053
...boxes and stuff.

00:50.180 --> 00:52.229
And last night in the hotel, I took apart the Kleenex box.

00:52.355 --> 00:54.388
I was just looking at it. And I'm telling you,...

00:55.661 --> 00:59.356
...the thing is, we'd go to this magic store in New York City called Lou Tannen's Magic.

00:59.685 --> 00:59.993
Anyway,...

01:02.586 --> 01:04.999
...so one of the things that I bought at the magic store was this:...

01:05.985 --> 01:07.316
....Tannen's Mystery Magic Box.

01:07.574 --> 01:09.503
If you look at this, you'll see it's never been opened.

01:10.105 --> 01:12.033
But I've had this forever.

01:12.603 --> 01:13.935
And there was this giant question mark.

01:14.043 --> 01:15.857
I love the design, for what it's worth, of this thing.

01:16.289 --> 01:17.898
And I started thinking, "Why haven't I opened it?"

01:18.016 --> 01:20.658
And I realized that I haven't opened it because it represents...

01:21.125 --> 01:23.017
...something important to me.

01:23.871 --> 01:25.095
It represents my grandfather.

01:25.477 --> 01:27.197
And so I started thinking about "Lost" and stuff that we do,...

01:27.360 --> 01:30.863
...and I realized, "Oh my God! Mystery boxes are everywhere in what I do!"

01:31.048 --> 01:33.008
In terms of the content of it, you look at that story,...

01:33.123 --> 01:35.232
...you think, "Well, what are stories but mystery boxes?"

01:35.397 --> 01:35.797
Finally,...

01:35.893 --> 01:39.224
there's this idea, stretching the sort of paradigm a little bit,...

01:39.354 --> 01:41.463
...but the idea of the mystery box...

01:41.586 --> 01:42.724
...meaning, what you think you're getting,...

01:43.372 --> 01:44.146
...than what you're really getting.

01:44.627 --> 01:46.544
And it's true in so many movies and stories.
