Today we call that following your dream, listening to your voice,...

00:06.304 --> 00:07.366
...to your inner voice.

00:08.674 --> 00:14.572
I encourage you to silence, not to silence that inner voice.

00:15.649 --> 00:23.573
At the same time, I must warn you that following your dream comes with a price.

00:24.474 --> 00:28.556
In my case, since I knew I would draw pictures,...

00:28.949 --> 00:35.422
...I didn't feel the need to learn math, chemistry, Latin, etc, etc.

00:35.986 --> 00:38.601
That turned out to be a big drawback...

00:39.517 --> 00:40.609
...and I regret that.

00:41.594 --> 00:46.440
Also, following that dream, listening to that little voice,...

00:48.151 --> 00:50.375
...does not guarantee success.

00:50.725 --> 00:53.647
I must really emphasize that.

00:55.229 --> 00:59.271
Luck is an ingredient not to be overlooked.

00:59.962 --> 01:03.150
I was lucky, a lucky late bloomer.

01:03.689 --> 01:08.615
One day, Bill Martin Jr. asked me to illustrate his "Brown Bear, Brown Bear,..."

01:08.858 --> 01:14.102
"...What Do You See?" after he had seen one of my illustrations for an advertisement.

01:14.784 --> 01:19.755
A couple of years later, I wrote my first own book,...

01:20.422 --> 01:22.936
...and I was very careful not to use words,...

01:24.099 --> 01:26.582
...and it is called "1, 2, 3 to the Zoo."

01:29.364 --> 01:31.870
At that time, I was 39 years old.

01:32.762 --> 01:38.255
Soon afterwards, I absentmindedly punched holes with a hole puncher...

01:38.491 --> 01:39.894
...into a stack of papers.

01:40.557 --> 01:43.263
The holes made me think of a bookworm,...

01:44.189 --> 01:48.856
...and with the help of my good editor, the bookworm became a caterpillar.

01:57.415 --> 01:59.738
It was published when I was 40 years old.

02:00.749 --> 02:05.864
You see, a good editor, a hole puncher in good working order,...

02:06.469 --> 02:09.675
...and a little bit of luck take you a long way.
