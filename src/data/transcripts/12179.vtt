I believe the taxi stand is just over here on the left.

00:05.989 --> 00:07.870
Yes, that looks like it over there.

00:08.266 --> 00:10.781
So which hotel are you staying at this time?

00:10.875 --> 00:12.077
The Belmont for now;...

00:12.647 --> 00:14.783
...the same one I stayed at last time I was here.

00:15.083 --> 00:17.449
Okay, I've heard that's a nice place.

00:17.601 --> 00:18.325
I think so.

00:18.470 --> 00:20.015
I had no complaints last time.

00:20.347 --> 00:21.529
This one is our cab.

00:21.774 --> 00:24.885
I guess there are usually a lot of cabs lined up here.

00:25.017 --> 00:25.642
That's good.

00:25.852 --> 00:28.809
I'd definitely like to get to my room as soon as possible.

00:29.089 --> 00:30.003
I can imagine.

00:30.495 --> 00:32.643
We need to go to the Belmont Hotel, please.

00:33.063 --> 00:35.255
Okay, ma'am, let me pop the trunk for you.

00:35.647 --> 00:36.311
Thank you.

00:36.761 --> 00:39.197
I really appreciate your coming here to meet me today.

00:39.383 --> 00:40.316
Don't mention it.

00:40.533 --> 00:41.567
It's my pleasure.
