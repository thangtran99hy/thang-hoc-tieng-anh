00:00.888 --> 00:02.396
I run ten miles every morning.

00:04.787 --> 00:06.523
Do 2,000 sit-ups a day.

00:07.828 --> 00:09.436
Eat 7,000 calories.

00:09.971 --> 00:11.744
And train for eight weeks straight.

00:12.917 --> 00:14.771
So, why did I get a small phone?

00:15.882 --> 00:17.767
Well, if there's one thing I know,...

00:19.624 --> 00:21.043
...little guys can pack a punch.

00:21.569 --> 00:25.596
Flip, stack, and move between active apps on the nation's smallest 4G smartphone.

00:25.827 --> 00:27.535
The HP Veer with webOS...

00:27.769 --> 00:29.074
...works like nothing else.
