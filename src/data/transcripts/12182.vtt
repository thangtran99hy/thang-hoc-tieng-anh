Did you know that people think that Egyptians were the first civilization that started manufacturing colors?

00:06.649 --> 00:08.857
They're known for their use of Egyptian blue.

00:09.365 --> 00:12.925
They would make blue glass out of copper and sand, and then grind it into a powder...

00:13.273 --> 00:15.639
...and mix it into a rich blue paint.

00:16.274 --> 00:20.451
They also made green paint by grinding and washing a mineral called malachite.

00:22.605 --> 00:25.334
The Egyptians would apply their paint using brushes...

00:25.600 --> 00:28.540
...that they made out of plant fibers and small twigs.

00:29.898 --> 00:33.709
You can see paintings from the Egyptian period covering their tombs and pyramids.

00:34.183 --> 00:37.728
And although paper, as we know it, wouldn't be invented for hundreds of years,...

00:38.138 --> 00:40.299
...they also painted on sheets of papyrus,...

00:40.850 --> 00:45.725
...which was a paperlike surface that they created from strips of fiber from papyrus plants.
