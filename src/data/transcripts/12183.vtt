What make of car is that?

00:04.081 --> 00:07.421
That one? Good choice, sir. Let's go have a look at it.

00:07.769 --> 00:09.179
Sorry, what is the make?

00:09.545 --> 00:10.433
What's the make?

00:10.724 --> 00:13.731
Well, this little gem is a Bowick Nightfall.

00:14.165 --> 00:16.680
I don't think I've ever heard of that brand before.

00:16.953 --> 00:20.193
Yes, it's a rare find. Kind of a collector's item!

00:20.433 --> 00:22.451
What sort of gas mileage does it get?

00:22.743 --> 00:24.684
I think it gets pretty good mileage.

00:25.040 --> 00:26.337
Can you check on that, please?

00:26.766 --> 00:28.035
What about other features?

00:28.227 --> 00:29.377
Does it come fully loaded?

00:29.821 --> 00:30.683
Yes, it does:...

00:30.963 --> 00:34.593
...disc brakes, power steering, sun roof, and so on.

00:34.757 --> 00:35.969
It looks pretty good to me.

00:36.337 --> 00:37.712
Congratulations sir,...

00:37.912 --> 00:40.119
...I don't think you could have made a better choice.
