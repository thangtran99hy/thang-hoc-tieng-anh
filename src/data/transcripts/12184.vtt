I'm going to need to start looking for a place to live.

00:03.977 --> 00:08.123
Good idea. You don't want to stay in that hotel the whole time you are here!

00:08.379 --> 00:10.823
Do you know a good way to find an apartment to rent?

00:11.121 --> 00:15.329
Well, I think the best thing to do is look at the rental ads in the newspapers.

00:15.523 --> 00:17.930
Okay, I'll try that. Is there anything else?

00:18.208 --> 00:20.951
Sure, you could visit a real estate agency.

00:21.211 --> 00:24.887
Hmm. Well, I think I will start by looking in the newspapers.

00:25.132 --> 00:29.873
Let me look with you. Maybe I can give you a hand. I know this city pretty well.

00:30.011 --> 00:31.905
Okay, what should I be looking for?

00:32.203 --> 00:36.040
Most of all, I think you should get a place that is in a nice neighborhood.

00:36.461 --> 00:38.713
I also don't want to be too far from work.

00:38.916 --> 00:39.817
Good point!
