The Guy's Manual; powered by Grape-Nuts,...

00:02.635 --> 00:03.940
...the one of a kind crunchy nuggets...

00:04.023 --> 00:06.420
...with the energy you need to get the tough things done.

00:07.161 --> 00:10.650
Updating Your Wardrobe after 15 years.

00:11.428 --> 00:14.390
They say that clothes make the man, which begs the question,...

00:14.627 --> 00:16.180
..."What are these clothes making you?"

00:16.613 --> 00:19.000
Robert, you're better than this. You and your wardrobe.

00:19.286 --> 00:20.487
Unless you're starting a new life...

00:20.586 --> 00:21.887
...as a globe-trotting socialite,...

00:22.305 --> 00:24.450
...most of these new duds will be seen at the office,...

00:24.574 --> 00:25.630
...so buy what you need.

00:25.990 --> 00:28.690
Research your new look online and pin down your must-haves:...

00:28.748 --> 00:30.153
...shirts, pants, shoes...

00:30.448 --> 00:32.540
... and make sure you can mix and match these babies.

00:32.865 --> 00:34.400
The more neutral colors, the better.

00:34.450 --> 00:36.570
Notice the style of your friends and co-workers.

00:36.889 --> 00:39.000
If you see something you like, put it on the list.

00:46.033 --> 00:46.980
Okay, next tip.

00:47.228 --> 00:48.845
Updating your threads is one thing,...

00:48.996 --> 00:51.440
... but flash forwarding to the year 3000 is another.

00:51.822 --> 00:53.170
So try dressing your age.

00:53.397 --> 00:56.000
If you can remember when gas was called "ethyl",...

00:56.385 --> 00:59.400
..it's in your best interest to not dress like a preteen pop star.

01:00.039 --> 01:02.740
Side rule coming: lucky for you fashion is cyclical,...

01:02.975 --> 01:04.070
...which means there's a chance...

01:04.218 --> 01:07.334
...you may have a few vintage gems stashed away at the back of your closet.

01:10.166 --> 01:13.170
Now, just because you look good in it doesn't mean you'll feel good in it.

01:13.515 --> 01:15.790
Find the happy medium of both style and comfort.

01:16.325 --> 01:19.110
You won't truly look good unless you feel comfortable.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.260
I can't feel my legs.

01:22.312 --> 01:23.460
Okay, the hard truth now.

01:23.828 --> 01:27.520
You shouldn't be allowed to leave the house in search of new duds all by yourself.

01:27.850 --> 01:29.980
Your taste got you into this mess in the first place, pal.

01:30.509 --> 01:31.760
Find a good shopping buddy.

01:32.816 --> 01:35.300
Hey honey, I was gonna go clothes shopping,...

01:35.639 --> 01:37.000
...if you're too busy...

01:37.355 --> 01:38.160
No! No, no.

01:38.412 --> 01:41.110
You'll be surprised who's eager to help you get back in the fashion.

01:47.627 --> 01:49.540
It may take some time, but you'll catch on.

01:52.447 --> 01:53.790
And then you'll reap the benefits.

01:54.264 --> 01:56.910
Until next time, enjoy being a well - dressed man,...

01:57.048 --> 01:57.990
...who gets the tough things done.
