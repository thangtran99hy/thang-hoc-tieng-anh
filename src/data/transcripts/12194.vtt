00:03.211 --> 00:05.903
So what do we need to get for the party tonight?

00:06.078 --> 00:08.993
Well, first of all we're going to need a lot of snacks.

00:09.214 --> 00:12.165
Okay, I think they are in aisle number six.

00:12.389 --> 00:13.675
Here we go, aisle six.

00:13.985 --> 00:16.007
What kind of chips do you think we should get?

00:16.216 --> 00:17.459
Let's get a variety.

00:17.664 --> 00:19.864
How about four or five different kinds?

00:19.989 --> 00:20.616
Sounds good.

00:20.959 --> 00:22.654
Now we need some drinks, too.

00:22.960 --> 00:26.299
Okay, they are in the refrigerators in the back of the store.

00:26.574 --> 00:30.791
I guess we should get plenty of beer, plus some non - alcoholic drinks as well.

00:31.061 --> 00:33.659
Yeah, let's get a few cases of beer.

00:33.735 --> 00:37.006
It's not like it will go bad or anything if we don't drink it all!

00:37.233 --> 00:37.913
Good point.

00:38.067 --> 00:39.858
Okay, I think that about does it.

00:40.177 --> 00:42.925
Let's go pay for all this and start getting things set up.

00:43.210 --> 00:43.841
All right.
