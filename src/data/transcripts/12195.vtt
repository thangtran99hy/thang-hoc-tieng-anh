00:02.337 --> 00:03.541
Next number, please!

00:03.936 --> 00:04.659
Good afternoon.

00:04.929 --> 00:06.010
Good afternoon, sir.

00:06.124 --> 00:07.563
What can I do for you today?

00:07.882 --> 00:10.092
I'd like to open up an account here, please.

00:10.379 --> 00:11.336
Certainly, sir.

00:11.573 --> 00:13.971
What sort of account are you looking to open?

00:14.178 --> 00:16.195
I want to open up a checking account.

00:16.799 --> 00:22.101
Okay, do you want an unlimited checking account, or a fixed monthly checking account?

00:22.309 --> 00:23.209
What is the difference?

00:23.636 --> 00:28.402
With an unlimited checking account, you can write as many checks as you like every month.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.717
Is there a monthly fee with that account?

00:31.031 --> 00:34.693
You need to maintain a minimum balance of one thousand dollars.

00:34.900 --> 00:39.167
Okay, so as long as I maintain the minimum balance, there's no fee.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.353
I think that would work out better for me.

00:41.710 --> 00:42.623
Let's go that route.
