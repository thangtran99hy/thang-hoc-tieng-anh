It was almost lunchtime...

00:02.705 --> 00:05.019
...and Paddington thought he'd stop for a sandwich.

00:06.357 --> 00:08.186
"I've always had marmalade," thought Paddington.

00:08.770 --> 00:10.503
"Maybe I ought to try something different."

00:19.897 --> 00:21.072
"Really rather good."

00:22.552 --> 00:24.004
"Hello, would you like some?"

00:31.636 --> 00:32.187
"Oh, dear."

00:34.089 --> 00:35.539
"I think you'd better come with me."

00:36.506 --> 00:39.117
Squeezy Marmite, sandwiches need never be dull.
