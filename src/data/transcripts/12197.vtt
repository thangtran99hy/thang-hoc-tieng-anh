It's almost like an oxymoron.

00:06.617 --> 00:11.273
You're in a dark, powerful suit and then you negated it by wearing a very soft, blue tie.

00:11.850 --> 00:14.849
Now, which one of these two men do you think looks the most professional?

00:15.371 --> 00:16.371
Which one looks like an expert?

00:16.755 --> 00:19.199
Everybody's pointing over in the direction of this man.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.888
So, white shirt and a striped tie is a nice combination for any Realtor...

00:25.300 --> 00:28.307
...because the white shirt says, "I'm formal, I'm professional."

00:28.700 --> 00:29.900
"I'm not going to be a slouch."

00:30.000 --> 00:31.291
"I'm not going to let anybody down."

00:31.800 --> 00:34.041
And the striped tie gives a certain friendliness.

00:34.450 --> 00:35.911
And it gives a businesslike look also.

00:36.600 --> 00:40.493
So, I advise that he give up sort of dusky-colored shirts.

00:40.714 --> 00:44.471
Either wear a French blue shirt; a blue and white striped shirt is perfectly nice.
