00:00.216 --> 00:01.927
I need to get to a post office.

00:02.135 --> 00:03.707
Do you know where the nearest one is?

00:04.036 --> 00:06.472
Yes, there's one not too far from here.

00:06.763 --> 00:08.008
Is it walking distance?

00:08.258 --> 00:11.853
Well, I suppose so, but it'd be a bit of a long walk.

00:12.065 --> 00:12.621
How long?

00:12.896 --> 00:14.553
Maybe twenty minutes or so.

00:14.773 --> 00:16.942
I'd rather get there a bit faster than that.

00:17.171 --> 00:18.187
Is there another way?

00:18.411 --> 00:22.340
Sure, just hop on the bus at that bus stop across the street.

00:22.463 --> 00:24.290
Okay, which bus do I get?

00:24.622 --> 00:28.133
I think both number 15 and number 17 go there.

00:28.301 --> 00:30.415
They both come by every five minutes.

00:30.548 --> 00:32.461
Sounds easy! Where do I get off?

00:32.751 --> 00:36.371
Just tell the driver that you want to get off at Commercial Street.
