00:02.045 --> 00:04.975
Excuse me, I've never been to a laundromat before.

00:05.171 --> 00:06.636
I'm not sure what to do.

00:06.934 --> 00:08.423
Okay, no problem.

00:08.620 --> 00:09.653
What do you need to do?

00:09.851 --> 00:11.143
Just regular washing?

00:11.421 --> 00:12.730
Yes, I guess so.

00:13.089 --> 00:14.850
 I just have regular clothes here.

00:15.109 --> 00:17.024
Okay, then it's pretty easy.

00:17.251 --> 00:20.198
You'll need to change about five dollars into quarters.

00:20.398 --> 00:21.437
Where can I do that?

00:21.825 --> 00:23.858
There's a coin changer right over here.

00:24.275 --> 00:25.319
Then what do I do?

00:25.611 --> 00:27.998
You'll need to get a small box of detergent.

00:28.220 --> 00:32.535
There is a vending machine that sells detergent next to the washing machines.

00:32.702 --> 00:33.153
Okay.

00:33.801 --> 00:37.355
So I guess I just put my clothes and the detergent in a washing machine.

00:37.594 --> 00:39.542
Yup, it's as simple as that.

00:39.755 --> 00:43.519
Let me know when you are done and I'll give you a hand with the dryers.

00:43.681 --> 00:44.664
Thank you very much.
