Excuse me ma'am, I'm looking for an international phone card.

00:07.285 --> 00:10.098
Okay, we have many you can choose from here.

00:10.373 --> 00:12.384
What country are you planning to call?

00:12.616 --> 00:16.310
Mostly Korea, I want to call my family and friends back home.

00:16.667 --> 00:20.902
Korea, okay, we have a few cards that would work well for you then.

00:21.093 --> 00:23.347
Hmm... they are all too expensive.

00:23.597 --> 00:25.787
Do you have a card called "Asian Express"?

00:25.999 --> 00:26.886
Yes, we have.

00:27.441 --> 00:30.328
It gives the best rates for calling countries in Asia.

00:30.667 --> 00:32.545
What are the rates to call Korea with it?

00:32.837 --> 00:37.747
Let's see... well, it depends if you use a cell phone or a landline.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.955
How much is it if I use a cell phone?

00:40.239 --> 00:42.554
With a cell phone it's six cents a minute.

00:43.020 --> 00:46.034
If you can use a landline, it's only three cents a minute.

00:46.223 --> 00:47.789
Okay, I'll take that one.

00:48.055 --> 00:48.676
How much is it?

00:49.061 --> 00:50.121
Ten dollars, sir.
