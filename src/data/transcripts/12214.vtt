Welcome to Fitness Universe.

00:05.147 --> 00:08.155
Hi! Could you tell me a little bit about your membership fees?

00:08.448 --> 00:10.810
Are you interested in our one - year membership?

00:11.210 --> 00:15.283
I'm going to be here for a year, so I guess that would be the best one to start with.

00:15.517 --> 00:18.082
Okay. For a regular one - year membership,...

00:18.227 --> 00:20.187
...the cost is $1,000.

00:20.531 --> 00:22.987
Does that include use of all the facilities?

00:23.207 --> 00:27.457
Yes, that includes use of the swimming pool and racquetball courts.

00:27.701 --> 00:29.811
How about if I want a personal trainer?

00:29.947 --> 00:33.409
Then your best bet would be to get a Gold Star membership.

00:33.673 --> 00:37.859
With that, you get a personal trainer to work with you three times every week.

00:38.181 --> 00:40.694
I see. How much is a Gold Star membership?

00:41.034 --> 00:45.362
A Gold Star membership is $1,500 per year, sir.

00:45.537 --> 00:48.847
Hmm... I think I'll just stick with the regular membership.
