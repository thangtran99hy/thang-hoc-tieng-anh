Where are you off to?

00:04.173 --> 00:05.656
I need to do some emailing.

00:05.890 --> 00:08.415
Do you know if there is an Internet cafe around here?

00:08.604 --> 00:11.429
Sure, there's one just a couple blocks away.

00:11.565 --> 00:12.563
I'll take you there.

00:12.684 --> 00:13.184
Thanks.

00:14.255 --> 00:16.451
Hello, I'd like to use a computer, please.

00:16.701 --> 00:21.431
Okay, do you want to play video games, surf the net, or print anything out?

00:21.637 --> 00:23.491
Well, I'd like to do some emailing.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.237
Let me go to the Internet room.

00:25.606 --> 00:26.864
You have separate rooms?

00:27.101 --> 00:30.641
Yeah, the kids can get pretty noisy when they play video games,...

00:30.785 --> 00:32.492
...so I have a separate room for them.

00:32.789 --> 00:35.670
I see. So, how much is it to use the Internet?

00:35.995 --> 00:37.539
It's five dollars per hour.

00:37.741 --> 00:40.939
If you want to print anything out, it's one dollar per page.

00:41.157 --> 00:42.091
Okay, thanks.
