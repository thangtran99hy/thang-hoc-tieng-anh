Thanks for picking up all that stuff at the store for me.

00:05.642 --> 00:06.544
My pleasure.

00:06.831 --> 00:09.659
I figured you were cooking up a pretty delicious meal,...

00:09.747 --> 00:11.238
...so I'm happy to help out.

00:11.552 --> 00:15.311
Well, if you really want to help out some more, it would be appreciated.

00:15.467 --> 00:17.661
Sure! What do you need me to do?

00:17.933 --> 00:20.583
For starters, I need to start getting the salad ready.

00:20.761 --> 00:22.455
Can you cut up some vegetables for me?

00:22.601 --> 00:23.481
Absolutely.

00:23.785 --> 00:24.867
Where should I begin?

00:25.180 --> 00:26.870
There's a bunch of carrots over there.

00:27.073 --> 00:29.658
Also, here are some onions and green peppers.

00:29.935 --> 00:32.088
Looks like it's going to be a good salad.

00:32.391 --> 00:33.779
I'll get right to work.

00:33.971 --> 00:36.039
Thanks. Oh, and one more thing.

00:36.168 --> 00:36.635
Uh huh?

00:36.906 --> 00:38.742
You might want to wash your hands first.

00:39.105 --> 00:40.586
Uh, yeah, sure thing.
