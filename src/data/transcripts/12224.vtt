00:03.081 --> 00:05.396
Did you know that this is a four - star restaurant?

00:05.645 --> 00:06.606
No, I didn't.

00:06.809 --> 00:08.298
But it sure looks like one.

00:08.506 --> 00:10.855
Yes, the ambience in here is amazing.

00:11.007 --> 00:12.603
I can't wait to try the food.

00:12.963 --> 00:16.211
I can imagine that it won't be the cheapest menu in town.

00:16.403 --> 00:18.127
No, but we expected that.

00:18.427 --> 00:20.664
Besides, you get what you pay for, right?

00:20.911 --> 00:21.726
Exactly!

00:22.915 --> 00:26.324
I've heard the filet mignon here is supposed to be cooked to perfection.

00:26.551 --> 00:29.972
I'm sure it's great, but I'm not really in the mood for a steak.

00:30.207 --> 00:32.331
Maybe you can try one of the fish dishes.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.630
I think I will.

00:33.927 --> 00:36.006
What are you planning to drink with your meal?

00:36.327 --> 00:37.799
They've got a great wine list.

00:38.029 --> 00:39.093
Let's have a look at it.

00:39.333 --> 00:41.812
Yes. A bottle of wine sounds great!
