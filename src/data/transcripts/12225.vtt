I was invited to a big party this evening.

00:05.244 --> 00:07.209
Sounds great! Who's giving it?

00:07.453 --> 00:08.754
One of the people at work.

00:09.118 --> 00:11.851
I think there will be mostly people from the company there.

00:12.114 --> 00:15.328
I'm sure a lot of other people will show up as well.

00:15.827 --> 00:19.240
They said it's "semiformal". What does that mean, exactly?

00:19.487 --> 00:19.863
Well,...

00:19.979 --> 00:24.377
...semiformal usually means that you aren't supposed to wear jeans or sneakers.

00:24.603 --> 00:26.610
Okay. What about the shirt?

00:26.859 --> 00:30.209
You should have a collared shirt, but a tie isn't necessary.

00:30.378 --> 00:32.151
Right, I think I understand.

00:32.468 --> 00:34.717
Anything else I should know before I go?

00:34.855 --> 00:38.630
Yes, be sure to bring some sort of gift for the host or hostess.

00:38.929 --> 00:39.617
Such as?

00:39.823 --> 00:42.967
A bottle of wine or some flowers would be perfect.
