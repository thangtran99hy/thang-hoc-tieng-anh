00:02.509 --> 00:03.255
Guess what!

00:03.600 --> 00:06.704
I got a couple of tickets for tonight's basketball game!

00:07.019 --> 00:08.615
Tickets for a basketball game?

00:08.826 --> 00:10.351
You mean an NBA game?

00:10.489 --> 00:12.296
Yeah! Do you want to join me?

00:12.562 --> 00:16.177
Absolutely! I've always wanted to see an NBA game live.

00:17.273 --> 00:19.227
I can't believe how many people are here.

00:19.550 --> 00:20.683
How big is this arena?

00:20.876 --> 00:23.657
I think it seats about 18,000 or so.

00:23.807 --> 00:26.772
It's usually full, so we're lucky to get seats.

00:27.100 --> 00:29.098
Yeah, and these are great seats, too.

00:29.500 --> 00:32.819
Well, actually they're only so-so, but not bad for the money.

00:33.170 --> 00:35.010
Are the best seats really expensive?

00:35.186 --> 00:37.189
Yes, they're very expensive.

00:37.485 --> 00:40.627
That's why I usually just watch the games on TV.

00:40.868 --> 00:41.252
Well,...

00:41.524 --> 00:44.755
...I'm just glad to have the chance to see a game while I'm living here.
