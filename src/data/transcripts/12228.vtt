What can I get you to drink, sir?

00:04.041 --> 00:06.065
Well, I think I'm in the mood for a beer.

00:06.371 --> 00:09.008
Okay, would you like draft or bottle?

00:09.228 --> 00:10.985
What kind of beer do you have on tap?

00:11.230 --> 00:14.521
All kinds; we have a few really good microbrews.

00:14.679 --> 00:16.274
Microbrews? What are they?

00:16.561 --> 00:21.091
Microbrews. You know, beers made in smaller, lesser - known breweries.

00:21.367 --> 00:22.248
Are they any good?

00:22.475 --> 00:28.080
Yeah! Most people, myself included, think they are a lot better than the more famous beers.

00:28.247 --> 00:32.103
Okay, I'll try. Get me a pint of whatever you recommend.

00:32.435 --> 00:35.990
Here you go. This is my favorite, and it's called Winterbrew.
