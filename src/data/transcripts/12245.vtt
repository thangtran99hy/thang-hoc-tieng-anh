So, what are you planning to do for your vacation?

00:06.619 --> 00:08.500
I want to take a trip somewhere,...

00:08.619 --> 00:10.112
...but I haven't decided where yet.

00:10.419 --> 00:10.982
A trip?

00:11.255 --> 00:12.401
That sounds cool!

00:12.663 --> 00:14.340
Where are you thinking about going?

00:14.521 --> 00:16.983
Well, I was thinking about going to Canada.

00:17.286 --> 00:19.204
I've heard it's a really beautiful country.

00:19.431 --> 00:20.301
Yes, it is.

00:20.505 --> 00:22.356
Where else are you thinking of going?

00:22.546 --> 00:24.894
The other place I'd like to go is Mexico.

00:25.115 --> 00:27.093
Mexico is a lot of fun.

00:27.316 --> 00:29.861
The food and culture there is quite different.

00:30.217 --> 00:31.945
I looked at ticket costs...

00:32.060 --> 00:34.833
...and I think it's actually a bit cheaper to go to Mexico.

00:35.097 --> 00:35.973
I believe it.

00:36.205 --> 00:39.281
I think hotels in Canada are a bit expensive.

00:39.631 --> 00:41.580
Well, the travel agent I spoke with...

00:41.675 --> 00:47.054
...said that I could get a good deal on a packaged tour to Mexico that included flights and hotels.

00:47.423 --> 00:49.302
Then why don't you take that option?

00:49.549 --> 00:50.588
I think I will.
