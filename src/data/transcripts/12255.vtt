You know, Thanksgiving is coming up soon.

00:04.330 --> 00:06.448
Sure, but I don't know too much about it.

00:06.677 --> 00:09.315
We have a different Thanksgiving celebration in Korea.

00:09.634 --> 00:14.840
Here in the US, we always celebrate Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday of November.

00:15.204 --> 00:17.282
Right, so it's next Thursday then?

00:17.493 --> 00:23.606
Yes. I really like Thanksgiving because it's a family holiday and it's not overly commercialized.

00:23.813 --> 00:24.599
What do you mean?

00:25.018 --> 00:28.895
Well, it's not all about spending lots of money on presents,...

00:29.124 --> 00:35.393
...and you are not inundated with television advertising around Thanksgiving the way you are around Christmas time.

00:35.523 --> 00:36.579
I see what you mean.

00:36.898 --> 00:42.979
On Thanksgiving, the main focus is to get together with your family and have a huge, delicious meal.

00:43.113 --> 00:43.932
Oh, I see.
