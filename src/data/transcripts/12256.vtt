00:02.364 --> 00:04.979
So, what do you have on tap for this summer?

00:05.130 --> 00:05.667
Huh?

00:06.407 --> 00:09.151
Do you have any big plans for your summer vacation?

00:09.488 --> 00:10.294
Not really.

00:10.419 --> 00:11.624
I only have a week off.

00:11.887 --> 00:14.334
That's plenty of time to do something fun!

00:14.717 --> 00:17.959
If you add in the two weekends, it's nine whole days!

00:18.086 --> 00:20.137
I guess I didn't look at it that way.

00:20.472 --> 00:22.108
I imagine I will do something.

00:22.540 --> 00:24.401
It'd be nice to get away for a little while.

00:24.868 --> 00:25.895
You're telling me!

00:26.142 --> 00:28.433
I'm heading down to the coast for a few days.

00:28.655 --> 00:30.335
Sounds like you're going to hit the beach.

00:30.537 --> 00:32.262
Yup, but only for a part of it.

00:32.508 --> 00:34.723
I want to visit my cousin in Chicago,...

00:34.868 --> 00:37.790
...so I'm going to fly there and spend a few days with him.

00:37.926 --> 00:39.555
When was the last time you saw him?

00:39.848 --> 00:41.485
It's been over two years now.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.319
I guess it's time for a visit, then!

00:43.522 --> 00:44.433
Definitely!
