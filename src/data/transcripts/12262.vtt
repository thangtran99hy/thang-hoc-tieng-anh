You're going to Jane's Halloween party, right?

00:05.100 --> 00:07.721
Yes, I am, but I don't know what to do about a costume.

00:08.300 --> 00:09.584
Don't you have a costume yet?

00:09.918 --> 00:13.091
No, I've never actually been to a Halloween party before.

00:13.759 --> 00:16.525
I see, well, not to worry, I will help you out.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.743
Great! What do you recommend I go as?

00:19.200 --> 00:22.401
Let's see, last year I went as a policeman.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.811
I think I still have my old costume.

00:25.296 --> 00:26.176
As a policeman?

00:26.572 --> 00:27.457
Is that legal?

00:28.649 --> 00:29.522
Of course it is!

00:29.944 --> 00:31.807
In fact, lots of people go as one.

00:32.257 --> 00:32.654
Well...

00:33.270 --> 00:33.733
Don't worry,...

00:34.117 --> 00:38.425
...as long as you don't pretend to be a real one on the street, everything is fine.

00:39.170 --> 00:41.569
Okay, so I'll just wear it at the party then.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.965
Exactly! And I think that it will fit you just right.
