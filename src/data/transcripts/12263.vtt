00:02.283 --> 00:04.317
So how was your golf game today?

00:04.561 --> 00:05.672
You look pretty happy...

00:05.804 --> 00:07.105
...it must have gone well.

00:07.471 --> 00:09.195
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

00:09.434 --> 00:10.121
Try me.

00:10.243 --> 00:10.983
What happened?

00:11.173 --> 00:12.415
I got a hole in one.

00:12.593 --> 00:13.613
I'm still shocked.

00:13.839 --> 00:14.830
I can't believe it!

00:15.088 --> 00:17.199
What? A hole in one?

00:17.554 --> 00:18.617
You're joking!

00:18.878 --> 00:20.751
Nobody gets a hole in one!

00:20.964 --> 00:22.218
I'm totally serious.

00:22.524 --> 00:24.431
I wouldn't joke about something like that!

00:24.599 --> 00:26.745
Wow! Congratulations!

00:26.949 --> 00:28.739
That's absolutely amazing!

00:29.007 --> 00:33.770
You know, most pro golfers go their entire career without acing a hole.

00:33.948 --> 00:34.360
I know.

00:34.532 --> 00:35.440
I'm still shaking!

00:35.971 --> 00:38.695
Well, I think this calls for a celebration.

00:39.069 --> 00:40.400
Let's go have a few drinks.

00:40.655 --> 00:41.659
On me, of course!

00:41.903 --> 00:42.635
Sounds great!

00:42.865 --> 00:44.201
I could use one about now.

00:44.492 --> 00:46.542
So what was the hole you did it on?

00:47.163 --> 00:48.449
It was the 16th hole;...

00:48.597 --> 00:50.847
...par three, 175 yards.

00:51.195 --> 00:52.349
I used a 9 - iron.
