00:03.780 --> 00:08.523
People come from around the world to tour the Warner Bros. Studio in Burbank.

00:09.700 --> 00:13.538
The four Warner brothers incorporated their film company in 1923.

00:13.907 --> 00:17.717
They started making films on this lot in Burbank in 1928.

00:19.180 --> 00:24.467
One of the most popular spots on the tour is the Central Perk set from Friends.

00:25.101 --> 00:28.641
You just never know who you'll run into or what you'll see.

00:29.429 --> 00:31.513
The lot is always changing.

00:31.627 --> 00:32.957
It's never the same tour twice.

00:33.027 --> 00:36.443
And that's what's fun and exciting for not only our guests, but for the tour guides also.

00:37.152 --> 00:40.348
On the Warner Bros. Tour, you may get a chance to see the Batmobile,...

00:40.773 --> 00:42.204
...the Lincoln from the Matrix,...

00:42.995 --> 00:44.808
...the Mystery Machine from Scooby Doo,...

00:45.660 --> 00:47.853
...and the Mach 5 from Speed Racer.

00:48.337 --> 00:51.258
It's always something new, something fresh every time somebody comes in.

00:51.373 --> 00:55.287
We have countless numbers of Batmobiles, cars, motorcycles. You name it, we have it.

00:55.477 --> 00:56.778
This is just a small fraction of it.

00:57.481 --> 01:00.757
The tour includes a visit to the Warner Bros. Museum.

01:01.690 --> 01:06.115
It's the only museum in Hollywood on a studio lot.

01:06.937 --> 01:10.013
Other studios, I guess, have tried every once in a while to do a museum...

01:10.089 --> 01:13.751
...but Warner's is the only one who really has treasured their history.

01:13.908 --> 01:16.619
The Harry Potter exhibit was amazing.

01:17.068 --> 01:18.486
I really enjoyed the Friends set.

01:19.086 --> 01:23.606
From hit TV shows to blockbuster films, the Warner Bros. Tour has it all.

01:24.101 --> 01:26.859
