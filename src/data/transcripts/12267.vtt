00:03.316 --> 00:05.057
The spirit of man has awakened.

00:05.761 --> 00:07.969
The soul of man has gone forth.

00:09.029 --> 00:13.869
Grant us the wisdom and the vision to comprehend the greatness of man's spirit...

00:14.493 --> 00:21.102
...that suffers and endures so hugely for a goal beyond his own brief span.

00:23.383 --> 00:25.241
We are all of us children of Earth,...

00:25.867 --> 00:28.620
...grant us that simple knowledge.

00:29.284 --> 00:34.097
If our brothers are oppressed, then we are oppressed.

00:35.023 --> 00:37.269
If they hunger, we hunger.

00:39.799 --> 00:44.195
If their freedom is taken away, our freedom is not secure.

00:45.275 --> 00:50.749
Grant us a common faith, that man shall know bread and peace;...

00:51.466 --> 00:55.426
...that he shall know justice and righteousness, freedom and security,...

00:56.254 --> 00:59.795
...an equal opportunity, and an equal chance to do his best,...

01:00.515 --> 01:04.001
...not only in our own lands, but throughout the world.

01:05.619 --> 01:08.517
And in that faith let us march,...

01:09.335 --> 01:14.428
...march toward the clean world our hands can make.

01:16.126 --> 01:16.649
Amen.
