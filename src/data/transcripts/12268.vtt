It's a tablet PC with a split personality.

00:04.331 --> 00:10.303
Taiwan's ViewSonic has developed a tablet that runs Android 2.2 and Windows 7 Professional.

00:10.793 --> 00:14.185
And it's showing it this week at the Computex IT Show in Taipei.

00:14.930 --> 00:18.304
Tablets running both operating systems have already been developed,...

00:18.676 --> 00:20.125
...including a model from ViewSonic.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.185
But this computer brings something new.

00:22.620 --> 00:27.027
Typically including our predecessor, our 10 series,...

00:27.959 --> 00:32.911
...you get to switch between the two OS but you need to do it from the boot up screen.

00:33.393 --> 00:39.405
But this one, we have advanced that technology into something that with one touch of a button,...

00:39.777 --> 00:41.638
...then you can switch between the two OS.

00:42.148 --> 00:45.349
ViewSonic expects buyers to use Windows primarily for work...

00:45.697 --> 00:49.697
...because of the greater number of business applications available on that platform.

00:50.027 --> 00:53.841
As a business user, you need both with a Windows environment,...

00:54.118 --> 00:55.974
...at the same time you're concerned about battery life.

00:56.466 --> 01:01.742
So, the concept of ViewPad 10Pro comes from; we want to take advantage of both worlds:...

01:01.809 --> 01:03.725
...the Windows world and also the Android world.

01:04.409 --> 01:07.929
Running Android uses less power than running Windows according to the company.

01:08.587 --> 01:11.973
The computer is based on Oak Trail, Intel's newest Atom processor,...

01:12.333 --> 01:16.095
...which should also bring power savings over previous Atom processors.

01:16.969 --> 01:24.435
The device will be priced between $699 and $799 when it goes on sale in Taiwan later this month.

01:24.875 --> 01:28.292
ViewSonic has yet to decide if it will put it on sale overseas.

01:28.877 --> 01:33.687
At Computex 2011 in Taipei, this is Martin Williams, IDG News Service.
