Welcome to El Cazador.

00:05.577 --> 00:05.955
Thank you.

00:06.289 --> 00:09.391
I've heard that once you try Mexican food, you get to love it.

00:09.617 --> 00:10.723
Well, that's true.

00:10.957 --> 00:11.860
What do you recommend?

00:12.168 --> 00:13.511
Everything is delicious.

00:13.755 --> 00:14.673
Do you like meat?

00:14.808 --> 00:16.390
Yes, I love meat dishes.

00:16.613 --> 00:18.931
Then why don't you try a combination plate?

00:19.476 --> 00:21.224
What is on a combination plate?

00:21.494 --> 00:25.566
You can get three very popular types of Mexican food on one plate.

00:25.729 --> 00:27.209
Sounds good. What are they?

00:27.605 --> 00:30.207
A taco, an enchilada, and a burrito.

00:30.463 --> 00:34.212
Of course you get re - fried beans, rice, and salad with it, too.

00:34.333 --> 00:36.389
Wow! That sounds like a lot of food!

00:36.605 --> 00:39.105
You won't leave hungry, I can promise you that.
