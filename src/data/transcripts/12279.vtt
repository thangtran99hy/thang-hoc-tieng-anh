Christina has done over 5,000 dives with her sharks...

00:12.256 --> 00:13.835
...and that's the key to getting close.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.798
It's all about experience and understanding,...

00:30.919 --> 00:32.547
...but her relationship is unique.

00:32.803 --> 00:35.737
She is so close to her sharks, it's almost maternal.

00:36.788 --> 00:38.215
I get emotionally attached to them...

00:38.298 --> 00:41.189
...because sometimes, I look down on them like they are big kids:...

00:41.456 --> 00:43.450
...just like all going for the same thing.

00:43.921 --> 00:46.800
They change their behavior according to how I behave.

00:46.908 --> 00:49.031
So if I relax, they tend to relax.

00:49.365 --> 00:52.443
If I get really nervous and edgy, they get as well.

01:02.717 --> 01:07.773
If I really would have to summarize what I feel when I finally have the sharks sleeping on my lap,...

01:08.371 --> 01:10.700
...I would say, it's peace, peaceful.

01:16.838 --> 01:19.433
But why on earth does she like to kiss them?

01:26.791 --> 01:32.293
I kiss a shark because to me, it's the final act of gentleness.

01:32.740 --> 01:35.245
And actually to tell you the truth, it was the only way,...
