A famous explorer once said...

00:07.191 --> 00:11.401
...that the extraordinary is in what we do, not who we are.

00:19.247 --> 00:22.144
I'd finally set out to make my mark...

00:25.076 --> 00:26.816
...to find adventure.

00:29.032 --> 00:33.352
But instead, adventure found me.

00:52.995 --> 00:54.817
In our darkest moments,...

00:57.874 --> 01:04.947
...when life flashes before us, we find something,...

01:08.983 --> 01:11.095
...something that keeps us going,...

01:18.169 --> 01:20.169
...something that pushes us.

02:10.818 --> 02:12.409
When all seemed lost,...

02:16.549 --> 02:17.875
...I found a truth.

02:25.299 --> 02:27.401
And I knew what I must become.
