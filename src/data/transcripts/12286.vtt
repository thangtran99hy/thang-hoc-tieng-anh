I was wondering if you could tell me a good place to go to have a drink.

00:07.302 --> 00:08.254
Do you like dancing?

00:08.602 --> 00:10.417
Well, I'm not much of a dancer.

00:10.691 --> 00:12.911
Clubbing in America is very fun.

00:13.107 --> 00:14.571
Okay, it sounds fun.

00:14.890 --> 00:17.704
I recommend that you go to La Casa del Rey.

00:17.845 --> 00:20.275
It's the most popular dance club in town.

00:20.963 --> 00:22.099
What was it called again?

00:22.227 --> 00:25.643
La Casa del Rey: it means the King's House.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.122
Is it busy there?

00:27.342 --> 00:28.595
It's always packed.

00:28.856 --> 00:30.489
Okay, I'll check it out then.
