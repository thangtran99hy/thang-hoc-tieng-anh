I received my first set of bills in the mail today.

00:05.729 --> 00:09.032
Well, at least that tells you that you are actually alive, right?

00:09.366 --> 00:11.709
I guess so, but I'd rather not have to pay them all.

00:12.022 --> 00:12.857
Wouldn't we all?

00:13.440 --> 00:15.428
Can you take a look at a couple of them for me?

00:15.683 --> 00:17.363
Sure, is there a problem?

00:17.712 --> 00:18.636
I'm not sure.

00:18.821 --> 00:21.103
The utility bill seems a little high to me.

00:21.367 --> 00:22.413
Let's have a look.

00:22.855 --> 00:25.015
Yes, it is a little high.

00:25.182 --> 00:26.105
Here's the reason.

00:26.377 --> 00:26.867
What is it?

00:27.223 --> 00:28.927
It's because it's your first month,...

00:29.091 --> 00:30.782
...there are some installation fees.

00:30.973 --> 00:31.727
Oh, I see.

00:31.903 --> 00:33.931
So it won't be so high from now on.

00:34.151 --> 00:34.996
It shouldn't be.
