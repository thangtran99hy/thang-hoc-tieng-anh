There are a ton of people who work on safety at Facebook.

00:07.594 --> 00:11.411
So, I think it really starts with the members of our user operations team...

00:11.588 --> 00:16.399
...who are on the front lines responding to people's concerns about safety or questions about safety.

00:16.789 --> 00:19.170
It's the engineers who are building the products,...

00:19.247 --> 00:22.943
...who take into account the specific needs of minors in building things.

00:23.357 --> 00:26.650
It's our site integrity teams who build tools like social reporting...

00:27.029 --> 00:29.500
...that allow people to report abuse both to Facebook...

00:29.623 --> 00:32.290
...and to someone in their community who might be able to help them.

00:33.140 --> 00:37.120
And these people work around the clock and around the globe.

00:37.466 --> 00:42.500
Everybody who was working on this is really passionate about the people who use the site...

00:42.917 --> 00:47.408
...and I think it's a great responsibility and a privilege to be able to support them,...

00:47.529 --> 00:52.817
...and all of us spend time thinking as parents and as friends...

00:53.175 --> 00:55.560
...about the people that we interact with in our lives.

00:55.784 --> 00:57.059
And as we think through these things,...

00:57.150 --> 01:01.497
...we try to make sure that we think about them and the people using the site.

01:01.903 --> 01:06.271
As someone who's been involved in safety online for 15 years,...

01:06.365 --> 01:09.007
...I've seen such an evolution on the Internet...

01:09.256 --> 01:12.752
...where it was truly an anonymous place where people thought...

01:12.909 --> 01:15.397
...they could act in ways that they couldn't offline.

01:16.176 --> 01:18.723
And maybe, there are still places on the Internet like that.

01:18.883 --> 01:24.231
But Facebook is a unique place, where we're trying to create that well-lit environment...

01:24.373 --> 01:25.994
...where you interact with real people.
