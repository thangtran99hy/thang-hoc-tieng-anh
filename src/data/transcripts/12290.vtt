Excuse me, where do I go to get a prescription filled?

00:08.017 --> 00:11.620
The prescription counter is in the back of the store on the left side.

00:12.064 --> 00:12.830
Thank you, ma'am.

00:14.821 --> 00:16.273
Yes sir, can I help you?

00:16.484 --> 00:19.013
Yes, I need to get this prescription filled, please.

00:19.289 --> 00:22.362
Okay, let's have a look. Pain relievers.

00:22.498 --> 00:23.983
Yes, just a moment, please.

00:24.195 --> 00:24.670
Thank you.

00:25.092 --> 00:26.085
Here you go, sir.

00:26.205 --> 00:28.265
You're supposed to take two pills a day.

00:28.528 --> 00:29.739
Do you mean twice a day?

00:29.932 --> 00:32.005
Should I take them before or after meals?

00:32.334 --> 00:34.812
You should take them thirty minutes after you eat;...

00:34.949 --> 00:37.116
...one in the morning and one in the evening.

00:37.285 --> 00:38.698
Okay, thank you very much.
