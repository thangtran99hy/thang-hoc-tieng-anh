00:01.899 --> 00:03.130
Did you hear the news?

00:03.283 --> 00:04.555
No, I don't think so.

00:04.759 --> 00:05.971
Anyway, what happened?

00:06.211 --> 00:08.954
The boss really dropped the bomb on us this time.

00:09.339 --> 00:11.715
Oh no, this doesn't sound good so far.

00:11.999 --> 00:13.229
It's worse than that.

00:13.428 --> 00:17.854
We've all got to put in extra hours and work on the weekends for the next month.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.469
What? He can't do that!

00:19.675 --> 00:21.419
Well, yes and no.

00:21.778 --> 00:24.927
If we don't get the Ambex project done by the end of the month,...

00:25.191 --> 00:26.847
...he can fire us if he wants.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.703
Man, this is terrible news.

00:28.977 --> 00:30.542
I've got a lot of plans this month!

00:30.910 --> 00:32.401
Why does he have to be like that?

00:32.653 --> 00:36.234
I guess it's come down to the crunch for the company with this deal.

00:36.446 --> 00:38.172
I knew it was a big deal for us,...

00:38.303 --> 00:39.840
...but I didn't know it was that big.

00:40.097 --> 00:41.484
Apparently it is!
