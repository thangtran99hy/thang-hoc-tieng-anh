00:02.163 --> 00:04.863
25 years of marriage and you have nothing to say?

00:05.441 --> 00:06.025
I'll just say it.

00:06.241 --> 00:07.160
I slept with someone.

00:07.431 --> 00:09.062
If you keep talking, I'm gonna get out of the car.

00:09.120 --> 00:12.011
I think the fact that I did it, it just shows how broken we are.

00:14.305 --> 00:15.565
Oh my god! Cal!

00:16.386 --> 00:17.273
You're getting a divorce?

00:17.442 --> 00:17.625
Yeah.

00:18.014 --> 00:19.522
Amy heard you crying in the bathroom.

00:19.859 --> 00:20.927
We all thought it was cancer.

00:21.509 --> 00:22.871
Thank god, man!

00:22.938 --> 00:24.296
Yeah, it's my relationship.

00:27.586 --> 00:28.677
Hi. Can I buy you a drink?

00:28.753 --> 00:29.063
Uh-huh.

00:29.181 --> 00:29.871
Let's get out of here.

00:29.985 --> 00:30.565
Wanna get out of here?

00:30.635 --> 00:30.831
Yeah.

00:30.949 --> 00:31.735
What are you doing later?

00:31.939 --> 00:32.635
I don't know.

00:32.965 --> 00:33.321
I do.

00:33.851 --> 00:36.751
There's lots of beautiful women in this bar but I can't take my eyes off of you.

00:36.825 --> 00:37.758
It's time to go home.

00:38.032 --> 00:39.259
Well that's forward of you, but okay.

00:39.429 --> 00:40.270
Should I pull the car around?

00:40.452 --> 00:41.009
You've been drinking?

00:41.107 --> 00:41.459
I'll drive.

00:41.963 --> 00:45.251
Hey ladies' man guy, got any tips of the trade?

00:45.416 --> 00:48.775
Your wife cheated on you because you lost sight of who you are as a man.

00:49.161 --> 00:50.300
Just take that straw out of your mouth;...

00:50.450 --> 00:51.206
...looks like you're sucking on it.

00:52.450 --> 00:52.843
Okay.

00:55.074 --> 00:56.645
You're sitting there with a Supercuts haircut...

00:56.932 --> 00:59.739
...and you're wearing a 44 when you should be wearing a 42 regular.

01:00.057 --> 01:00.441
Credit card.

01:02.294 --> 01:02.999
Where are your wallets?

01:04.783 --> 01:05.385
Would you sleep with him?

01:05.762 --> 01:07.029
Jeez, god!

01:07.249 --> 01:08.171
Yeah, probably.

01:08.385 --> 01:08.941
You would?

01:09.104 --> 01:10.747
You gotta take control of your manhood, pal.

01:10.998 --> 01:12.213
Can you put on some clothes, please?

01:12.291 --> 01:13.257
I'm sorry, is this bothering you?

01:15.437 --> 01:15.828
Beautiful.

01:23.173 --> 01:24.511
I wonder what you'll do with me?

01:24.703 --> 01:27.239
I wanna show you off to my ex - wife, make her really jealous.

01:31.012 --> 01:33.323
I met a girl and she is a game changer.

01:34.783 --> 01:36.004
She's your soul mate, right?

01:36.256 --> 01:36.951
Go get her back.

01:37.357 --> 01:38.542
Wow. How old are you?

01:39.822 --> 01:42.154
I'm in love with her and I don't know what to do about it.

01:46.880 --> 01:48.894
I don't know when you and I stopped being us.

01:49.137 --> 01:50.785
You know when I told you that I had to work late,...

01:50.884 --> 01:53.239
...I really went to see the new Twilight movie by myself.

01:53.637 --> 01:55.017
And it was so bad.

02:06.585 --> 02:08.037
I should have fought for you.

02:15.557 --> 02:16.024
Take off your shirt.

02:16.218 --> 02:16.523
Why?

02:16.832 --> 02:17.549
Will you take off your shirt?

02:18.867 --> 02:21.239
Seriously? It's like you're photoshopped!
