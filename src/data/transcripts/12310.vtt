When I arrived in the UK, I was surprised to see how international is this community,...

00:05.541 --> 00:08.303
...and literally people are coming from all over the world.

00:08.380 --> 00:11.331
Not only students, but also the staff.

00:12.445 --> 00:16.189
That is actually a very strong message that is very rare internationally.

00:16.474 --> 00:19.296
The fact that you have a culture that is open enough...

00:19.389 --> 00:24.441
...actually, to allow other people to come in from different countries,...

00:24.794 --> 00:28.367
...if they deserve it, to take key jobs.

00:28.791 --> 00:32.956
In the UK, you have a very strong concept of meritocracy.

00:39.387 --> 00:46.791
One of the aspects of the UK I really like is having a foot in the past and a foot in the future.

00:50.613 --> 00:58.776
This is one of the events of the Royal Society to celebrate the 350th anniversary of the Royal Society.

01:00.762 --> 01:10.363
What I think is fantastic is the idea that such a great institution that goes past centuries is not just a fossil.

01:11.566 --> 01:17.359
It's still an institution and it's inspiring us to do great science today.

01:20.339 --> 01:24.981
I was awarded a university research fellowship by the Royal Society.

01:26.186 --> 01:34.305
Of course, if I come here and I look at all these beautiful portraits of scientists like Newton, Boyle,...

01:35.953 --> 01:37.300
...then I feel a lot of pressure.

01:38.724 --> 01:40.783
You have all the past talking to you...

01:41.331 --> 01:46.128
...to sort of support you and encourage you to do a brighter future.

01:50.561 --> 01:58.117
Are there any planets with other Royal Society looking back at us and seeing us as alien?

01:59.130 --> 02:04.213
I really think that simple life, in terms of bacteria microorganisms,...

02:04.864 --> 02:06.291
...is probably very common out there.

02:07.210 --> 02:12.158
Maybe civilization, it's something a little bit more difficult to form.

02:13.231 --> 02:14.945
We shall see what this theorem will tell us.
