00:02.901 --> 00:05.265
I'm never going to get this done on time.

00:05.375 --> 00:06.798
Come on! Of course you are.

00:06.934 --> 00:08.114
No, I'm not.

00:08.234 --> 00:10.127
I've barely scratched the surface.

00:10.304 --> 00:11.811
This is going to take forever.

00:11.965 --> 00:13.224
Nothing takes forever.

00:13.325 --> 00:16.345
Just put your mind on it and it'll be finished before you know it.

00:16.651 --> 00:19.861
I wish I could be as optimistic as you, but I can't.

00:20.073 --> 00:21.743
My boss is going to kill me!

00:21.859 --> 00:22.706
No, he's not.

00:22.841 --> 00:26.436
He won't have any reason to because you're going to do a great job on it.

00:26.846 --> 00:30.116
Get real! Here, just take a look at all this.

00:30.391 --> 00:34.315
Let's see ... yeah, it's a lot of work, but you can get it done.

00:34.509 --> 00:35.765
I've seen you do it before.

00:36.053 --> 00:38.383
That was before. This is now.

00:38.544 --> 00:40.455
This is a monumental project.

00:40.580 --> 00:41.464
Well, you know,...

00:41.651 --> 00:44.033
...you're not helping yourself out by talking about it.

00:44.251 --> 00:45.184
Just start doing it!

00:45.413 --> 00:47.344
All right, I guess you're right.

00:47.555 --> 00:51.645
But you've got to help me find a new job after I get canned from this one.
