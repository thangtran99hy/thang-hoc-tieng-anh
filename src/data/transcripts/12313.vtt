I want to get some new CDs to listen to at home.

00:05.342 --> 00:06.831
Do you have any recommendations?

00:07.058 --> 00:09.723
Sure, what kind of music are you looking for?

00:09.893 --> 00:11.581
I'd like to get a variety of stuff.

00:11.847 --> 00:13.711
Well, as far as rock goes,...

00:13.819 --> 00:16.970
...the "Nighthawks" have a great new album that just came out.

00:17.136 --> 00:19.360
Really? Yeah, I think I've heard of them.

00:19.626 --> 00:20.458
That might be good.

00:20.818 --> 00:23.723
Also, for the easy listening there is a collection of ...

00:23.846 --> 00:27.212
...great chill-out songs on a CD called "House Arrest".

00:27.387 --> 00:29.741
Do you have a copy of that CD?

00:29.909 --> 00:30.730
Yes, I do.

00:30.971 --> 00:33.325
I'd be happy to let you borrow it if you like.

00:33.493 --> 00:35.283
Okay, thank you. That'd be great.

00:35.614 --> 00:40.287
Why don't you come over to my place this weekend and listen to some of my CDs?

00:40.530 --> 00:43.023
Maybe it will help you decide what you want to buy.

00:43.117 --> 00:44.886
That sounds like a great idea!
