What kind of TV shows do you like to watch?

00:05.932 --> 00:08.405
I'm not really into TV all that much.

00:08.655 --> 00:12.465
My parents always called it the "Idiot Box" and I kind of agree with them.

00:12.689 --> 00:14.013
Yeah, I know what you mean.

00:14.256 --> 00:17.515
Still, I find myself watching it more often than I'd like to admit.

00:17.697 --> 00:19.409
Sure, I can understand that.

00:19.591 --> 00:21.049
It can be pretty addicting.

00:21.279 --> 00:23.286
I really like watching reality shows.

00:23.597 --> 00:25.756
You know, like "Survivor" and stuff like that.

00:25.978 --> 00:29.128
Oh sure, I guess they can be a little more interesting.

00:29.291 --> 00:30.829
Exactly, hence the name!

00:31.205 --> 00:33.368
I prefer watching real people to actors.

00:33.722 --> 00:36.302
I feel that I can relate to them better somehow.

00:36.492 --> 00:40.526
Yes, and the fact that everything is more natural, and not scripted,...

00:40.621 --> 00:41.900
...makes them a bit better.

00:42.203 --> 00:44.565
It sounds like you still don't watch them very often.

00:44.728 --> 00:45.422
You're right.

00:45.571 --> 00:49.599
There are too many other things I'd rather be doing than watching TV.
