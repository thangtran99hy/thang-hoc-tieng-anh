Hey, did you take a look at the cover of this week's "Celebrity Tattler"?

00:06.057 --> 00:09.801
No, I don't usually read those Hollywood gossip magazines.

00:09.956 --> 00:12.456
Me neither, but I just had to pick this one up.

00:12.717 --> 00:13.414
Check it out!

00:13.623 --> 00:14.413
Let's see.

00:14.781 --> 00:19.026
Well, Brad Pitt is breaking up with a girlfriend and divorcing his wife.

00:19.248 --> 00:20.208
How interesting!

00:20.357 --> 00:23.197
No, not that. Look what it says at the bottom.

00:23.477 --> 00:24.382
You mean here?

00:24.583 --> 00:28.886
"Entire Cast of Friends Takes a Holiday at a Nudist Colony."

00:29.034 --> 00:30.693
Yeah, isn't that amazing?

00:30.870 --> 00:31.921
Not really.

00:32.265 --> 00:36.669
Are people that bored with their own lives that they need to read about stuff like this?

00:36.856 --> 00:39.227
I guess so. You know, it's strange,...

00:39.434 --> 00:42.564
...I just felt like I had to buy the magazine when I saw it.

00:42.795 --> 00:45.194
One thing about TV and Movie stars,...

00:45.380 --> 00:48.471
...they're always getting themselves into some kind of trouble.

00:48.662 --> 00:49.767
That's very true.
