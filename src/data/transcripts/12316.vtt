Hey, take a look at this!

00:05.744 --> 00:08.243
What are you looking at? Is that today's paper?

00:08.565 --> 00:10.365
Yes, check out this ad.

00:10.527 --> 00:11.385
What does it say?

00:11.644 --> 00:13.567
It's for Kingsley's department store.

00:13.753 --> 00:15.915
They're having a big sale this weekend.

00:16.030 --> 00:19.230
Really? Kingsley's is the best department store in the city.

00:19.620 --> 00:24.283
It says here that everything in the store is between 30 and 50 percent off.

00:24.441 --> 00:25.505
That's quite a sale,...

00:25.645 --> 00:27.863
...maybe we ought to go check it out this weekend.

00:28.233 --> 00:29.941
I could use some new shirts.

00:30.073 --> 00:32.526
And I wouldn't mind picking up a new CD player.

00:32.787 --> 00:34.706
They're 50% off. Wow!

00:34.952 --> 00:38.064
How about we head there first thing on Saturday morning?

00:38.221 --> 00:38.721
Done!
