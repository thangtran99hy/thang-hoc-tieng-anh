Did you see the football game last night?

00:04.497 --> 00:06.189
No, I missed it unfortunately,...

00:06.396 --> 00:08.195
...but I heard it was an amazing game.

00:08.403 --> 00:09.463
Was it ever!

00:09.739 --> 00:13.337
The Seahawks were down by four touchdowns in the last quarter,...

00:13.585 --> 00:15.640
...but came back to win it in overtime.

00:15.831 --> 00:18.943
Sounds like a thriller! I bet the fans were going crazy.

00:19.287 --> 00:23.155
The players said that they couldn't even hear themselves think on the field.

00:23.402 --> 00:25.048
So what happened exactly?

00:25.408 --> 00:29.801
Well, as I said, they were down by 28 points in the last quarter,...

00:30.085 --> 00:33.637
...but they just got on a roll and tied the game on the final play.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.390
Then it went into overtime?

00:35.607 --> 00:39.551
Yeah, and they got a field goal to win it in the first few minutes.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.324
Man, I'm sorry I missed it.

00:41.595 --> 00:44.091
That'll teach you to work late on a Monday night!

00:44.270 --> 00:44.930
I'll say!
