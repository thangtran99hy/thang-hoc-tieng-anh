00:02.800 --> 00:05.197
So, who do you like in the upcoming election?

00:05.490 --> 00:08.683
Uh-oh. You're not talking politics, are you?

00:08.923 --> 00:13.283
My father always told me never to talk about politics or religion with people.

00:13.397 --> 00:14.639
Really? Why's that?

00:14.999 --> 00:16.409
It can only lead to trouble.

00:16.647 --> 00:19.937
Better to talk about sports and movies and stuff like that.

00:20.086 --> 00:22.427
That's boring and predictable. Come on!

00:22.622 --> 00:24.573
Have you decided who you're going to vote for?

00:24.855 --> 00:27.883
Man, you really want to drag it out of me, don't you?

00:28.028 --> 00:29.410
Well? Have you?

00:29.605 --> 00:33.425
Okay, fine! To be honest, I'm still undecided.

00:33.797 --> 00:36.637
But I do know that I think it's time for a change at the top.

00:36.919 --> 00:40.587
I see. Well, good news! I totally agree with you!

00:40.878 --> 00:43.692
Now hold on, I said I was still undecided.
