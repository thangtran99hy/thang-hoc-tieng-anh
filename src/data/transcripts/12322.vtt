The paper here says that the economy is set for an upturn.

00:05.485 --> 00:06.187
I hope so,..

00:06.374 --> 00:09.034
...but you know you can't believe everything that you read.

00:09.307 --> 00:12.847
I suppose.  Still, it's always good to read something encouraging.

00:13.177 --> 00:13.895
That's true.

00:14.235 --> 00:17.551
I think the stock market hasn't been doing all that well of late.

00:17.859 --> 00:18.471
No, it hasn't.

00:18.686 --> 00:23.231
Both the NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange have been in the doldrums for a while now.

00:23.604 --> 00:28.300
I think that the government hasn't done a very good job of managing the economy, either.

00:28.625 --> 00:30.169
Well, it's all interconnected.

00:30.401 --> 00:33.950
The economy as a whole could definitely use a shot in the arm.

00:34.239 --> 00:35.431
There's an old saying,...

00:35.699 --> 00:38.595
..."What goes up must come down, and vice versa."

00:38.929 --> 00:41.362
So "what goes down" must also come up, then?

00:41.676 --> 00:44.231
Exactly. I wouldn't worry too much about it.

00:44.629 --> 00:48.165
Besides, when stocks are low, it's the best time to buy, right?

00:48.323 --> 00:51.520
Maybe, but I'm going to hold on to my money for a while yet.
