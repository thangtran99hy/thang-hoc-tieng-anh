Did you hear there's going to be a big anti-fur rally downtown today?

00:06.409 --> 00:09.101
Anti-fur rally? What is that all about?

00:09.369 --> 00:11.791
You know, people are against killing animals.

00:12.215 --> 00:13.973
Oh, well, I agree with that.

00:14.268 --> 00:15.931
Maybe I should go to the rally.

00:16.305 --> 00:17.549
Sure, why not?

00:17.761 --> 00:20.447
It's going to be in front of Blumenthal's Department Store.

00:20.704 --> 00:22.663
Blumenthal's? Why there?

00:22.963 --> 00:27.429
Because they just signed a multimillion dollar deal to import expensive rare...

00:27.578 --> 00:28.586
...furs from Russia.

00:28.715 --> 00:32.250
Oh, I see. Then I guess that's a good place to hold the rally.

00:32.513 --> 00:34.765
I heard even the mayor is going to be there.

00:34.945 --> 00:36.742
He's going to make a speech, too.

00:36.860 --> 00:39.071
He must feel very strongly about the issue.

00:39.294 --> 00:42.938
He does. He is well-known to be a strong environmentalist.
