00:02.487 --> 00:05.123
I can't believe you guys put together a party for me.

00:05.438 --> 00:06.443
What do you mean?

00:06.751 --> 00:10.251
Did you think we were just going to let you leave without a proper goodbye?

00:10.453 --> 00:13.123
This was so nice of you. I'll never forget you guys.

00:13.439 --> 00:14.927
The same is true for us.

00:15.091 --> 00:16.993
It's been great having you here with us.

00:17.166 --> 00:18.477
It's been great being here.

00:18.693 --> 00:20.636
I promise I will keep in touch with you all.

00:21.099 --> 00:21.927
So will we.

00:22.138 --> 00:24.875
We're also going to find a way to get you back here again!

00:25.019 --> 00:27.838
That would be great. I'll be back someday, I know it.

00:28.154 --> 00:30.779
So what's the first thing you're going to do when you get home?

00:30.988 --> 00:33.391
Well, my family is picking me up at the airport.

00:33.629 --> 00:36.030
I guess we'll all go out for a nice dinner together.

00:36.315 --> 00:39.055
I bet they're going to be really happy to see you again!

00:39.237 --> 00:41.641
Not as happy as I'm going to be to see them!
