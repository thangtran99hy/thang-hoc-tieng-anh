I can't believe it's already time for me to leave.

00:04.948 --> 00:07.759
Tell me about it. It feels like you just got here!

00:07.937 --> 00:10.285
A year can really go by fast, can't it?

00:10.691 --> 00:14.077
It sure can. So how do you feel about going back home?

00:14.229 --> 00:17.548
Well, I'm really happy to be seeing my family again, of course.

00:17.783 --> 00:18.433
Of course!

00:18.819 --> 00:20.686
But, I'm really sad to be leaving here.

00:20.976 --> 00:22.844
I've had such a fantastic time here.

00:23.131 --> 00:25.992
I'm glad to hear that. You can always come back, you know.

00:26.131 --> 00:29.209
Yes, I do know that. I'm so sad to leave.

00:29.635 --> 00:31.664
I know that I've made some real friends here.

00:31.930 --> 00:34.012
You definitely have. But, hey!

00:34.288 --> 00:35.728
You're not leaving just yet,...

00:36.001 --> 00:38.580
...let's go out and have one more fun night out together!

00:38.727 --> 00:39.708
Sounds great to me!
