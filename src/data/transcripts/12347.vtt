00:17.850 --> 00:19.163
Don't tell us what we can't do.

00:20.497 --> 00:24.138
Don't tell us not to dream big, fat, hairy, audacious dreams...

00:26.720 --> 00:28.652
...like making the world better through sport.

00:30.153 --> 00:31.571
Sport is our passion.

00:33.937 --> 00:38.751
Sport inspires hope, instills discipline, reduces depression and disease.

00:38.916 --> 00:42.844
It raises self-confidence, raises awareness, rallies communities,...

00:42.944 --> 00:46.430
...defines nations, defies gravity, and denies prejudice.

00:49.131 --> 00:50.992
Sport laughs in the face of racism.

00:51.227 --> 00:55.247
It flicks a towel on sexism's ass and kicks sand in the face of discrimination.

00:57.515 --> 00:59.451
It makes neck hair stand to attention.

01:00.099 --> 01:02.467
Hell, it's even been known to stop wars.

01:02.746 --> 01:04.103
That's a pretty impressive resume.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.279
Sport, you're hired.

01:09.712 --> 01:14.288
We won't rest until every living, breathing person on this planet has access to it...

01:14.699 --> 01:18.291
...and we won't stop making the best gear to propel humanity forward,...

01:18.979 --> 01:21.551
...without wrecking our global playground in the process.

01:23.577 --> 01:25.457
We will do good with a vengeance.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.109
And to all the cynics and the naysayers,...

01:35.417 --> 01:37.252
...we're gonna make the world better for you anyway,...

01:38.787 --> 01:41.608
...because like sport, we don't discriminate.

01:45.185 --> 01:46.333
We've made the world better,...

01:49.613 --> 01:50.929
...but we still want a better world.
