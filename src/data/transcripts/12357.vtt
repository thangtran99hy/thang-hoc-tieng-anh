China will soon hold the Olympic Games in Beijing...

00:04.693 --> 00:07.047
...and they will start at the luckiest possible moment.

00:07.437 --> 00:08.660
According to tradition,...

00:08.991 --> 00:10.936
...8 is an auspicious number in China...

00:11.348 --> 00:15.597
...and therefore the Olympics will start on August 8, 2008 at 8 p.m.

00:16.227 --> 00:18.238
Eight is considered very lucky in China...

00:18.572 --> 00:21.485
...because its pronunciation sounds the same as the word for...

00:21.597 --> 00:23.296
..."to make money" in Cantonese.

00:24.183 --> 00:26.387
Chinese culture is steeped in superstition,...

00:26.711 --> 00:30.446
...with numbers playing a major role in birthdays, wedding dates and naming.

00:31.039 --> 00:33.567
Six, eight and nine are considered lucky numbers,...

00:33.971 --> 00:37.341
...while four, seven and even one are considered more unfortunate.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.409
The pronunciation of nine means everlasting,...

00:40.797 --> 00:42.547
...particularly in relationships,...

00:42.976 --> 00:45.097
...while six means things will go smoothly.

00:46.033 --> 00:50.107
Telephone numbers, license plates and even residential or business addresses...

00:50.241 --> 00:53.113
...that use any of them or any combination of those numbers...

00:53.431 --> 00:54.709
...are extremely popular.

00:55.357 --> 00:56.039
Conversely,...

00:56.387 --> 01:00.350
...anything involving the numbers four and seven are avoided as much as possible.

01:01.205 --> 01:03.333
Four sounds like the Chinese word for death.

01:03.981 --> 01:07.077
Seven translates as "gone" which can also mean death,...

01:07.528 --> 01:09.667
...while one can signify loneliness.
