00:02.529 --> 00:03.368
Across the globe,...

00:03.493 --> 00:06.415
...people are choosing to have fewer children or none at all.

00:06.985 --> 00:08.919
Governments are desperate to halt the trend,...

00:09.281 --> 00:11.897
...but their influence seems to stop at the bedroom door.

00:12.397 --> 00:15.587
Are some societies destined to become extinct? Hardly.

00:16.178 --> 00:20.009
However, birth rates are falling far below replacement levels in China,...

00:20.313 --> 00:22.342
...Japan, Singapore, and South Korea.

00:22.934 --> 00:25.903
And after five decades of industrialization, Korea,...

00:26.108 --> 00:31.321
...a mostly rural country with six births per woman during its civil war in the 1950s,...

00:31.697 --> 00:34.691
...now has 1.08 births per woman.

00:35.668 --> 00:39.118
Korea's birthrate is the lowest in the 30 - member OECD...

00:39.531 --> 00:43.523
...and the birthrate has fallen to its lowest level on record in 2005,...

00:43.933 --> 00:47.677
...sparking concern about our shrinking population and aging society.

00:48.328 --> 00:50.685
Due to dwindling births, Korea's population...

00:51.024 --> 00:52.951
...which stands at 48 million this year,...

00:53.415 --> 00:56.728
...is forecast to fall to 40 million in 2050.

00:57.613 --> 00:59.670
Hong Kong has the world's lowest birthrate...

01:00.001 --> 01:03.272
...at 0.95 per woman of childbearing age.

01:03.859 --> 01:05.667
But, if the trend in Korea continues,...

01:06.087 --> 01:09.543
...birth rates will approach or dip even lower than those of Hong Kong.

01:10.812 --> 01:12.257
The National Statistics Office...

01:12.608 --> 01:15.891
...has said that more women were putting off marriage to a later age,...

01:16.323 --> 01:18.035
...with many reluctant to have children.

01:18.507 --> 01:21.320
Despite incentives from the government to boost the birthrate,...

01:21.718 --> 01:23.167
...young Koreans regard children...

01:23.329 --> 01:26.651
...as an expensive burden on their lifestyles and careers.
