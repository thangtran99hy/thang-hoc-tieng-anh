00:02.844 --> 00:04.290
Do you believe in ghosts?

00:04.676 --> 00:05.719
Rationally, no.

00:05.939 --> 00:08.099
But in spooky surroundings, well...

00:08.799 --> 00:12.465
We were discussing ghostly experiences in my  psychology class.

00:12.972 --> 00:15.333
A friend of mine told us about a laughing ghost...

00:15.443 --> 00:17.956
...that sits on the chests of young Asian males,...

00:18.255 --> 00:20.727
...suffocating them if they can't push  the demon off.

00:21.440 --> 00:24.821
Evidently, this ghost only has it in for any young males...

00:24.891 --> 00:26.119
...with Asian blood in them.

00:26.738 --> 00:28.363
He asked with all seriousness,...

00:28.809 --> 00:30.347
..."Hasn't it ever happened to you?"

00:30.898 --> 00:34.318
I laughed and asked him if I was in danger because of my Asian blood.

00:34.970 --> 00:36.680
He looked at me with fear and said,...

00:37.139 --> 00:39.189
..."It happened to me a couple of nights ago...

00:39.583 --> 00:41.755
...and I bet he's still around, watch out."

00:42.335 --> 00:44.460
Never had I gotten such a good laugh!

00:45.137 --> 00:50.050
In fact, this phenomenon is very common and is known as sleep paralysis.

00:50.615 --> 00:54.139
It's important for your body to not move too much while you are asleep...

00:54.437 --> 00:55.766
...because you might hurt yourself.

00:56.370 --> 00:57.844
But sometimes if you wake up...

00:57.973 --> 01:00.250
...before your body can recover from this state...

01:00.666 --> 01:03.046
... or if you are having strong clear dreams,...

01:03.472 --> 01:05.656
...you may sense a heavy pressure on your chest...

01:05.917 --> 01:07.609
...and feel as if you cannot move.

01:08.270 --> 01:10.428
Just remember, it's not a ghost!

01:10.863 --> 01:14.301
It is something that can happen to anyone anytime they are asleep.

01:15.056 --> 01:16.324
Every culture in the world...

01:16.406 --> 01:19.019
...has different ways of talking about this phenomenon.

01:19.583 --> 01:21.847
The Chinese call it the "bed press ghost".

01:22.290 --> 01:24.925
In the West, it is known as the "scissors lock" ...

01:25.255 --> 01:26.831
...which is a kind of wrestling move.
