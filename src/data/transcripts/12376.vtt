I'm a cyholic, a Cyworld fanatic.

00:05.717 --> 00:09.711
Cyworld's temptations have me waking up with bloodshot eyes and headaches,...

00:09.985 --> 00:13.517
...and have turned me into an exhibitionist and virtual cyber stalker.

00:14.111 --> 00:17.849
I'm studying abroad and Cyworld is like an international telephone.

00:18.298 --> 00:22.299
I use Cyworld's mini home pages to both keep in touch with friends,...

00:22.632 --> 00:25.226
...and regrettably, to spy on my ex - boyfriend.

00:25.877 --> 00:30.306
I try not to visit my own home page every day but I can't help myself.

00:31.127 --> 00:34.483
My new free cyber - home has so many wonderful features.

00:34.943 --> 00:39.259
It also came with an avatar called "mini me" who is my alter ego.

00:39.865 --> 00:41.341
I spend hours changing its...

00:41.456 --> 00:44.313
...facial expression, body position, hair, and clothing.

00:44.953 --> 00:46.297
The more people visit me,...

00:46.585 --> 00:49.995
...the more I feel I constantly need to do something to keep them coming.

00:50.501 --> 00:53.268
Those page visit numbers give me an incentive...

00:53.367 --> 00:56.730
...spend both money and time decorating my electronic home.

00:57.298 --> 01:00.577
Cyworld displays your popularity on your front page,...

01:00.954 --> 01:03.605
...which makes you constantly want to upgrade your page.

01:04.215 --> 01:08.274
Cyworld knows that Koreans tend to be ambitious and ostentatious.

01:08.851 --> 01:12.219
They use social engineering knowledge to measure your "success".

01:12.765 --> 01:16.547
They know I like having my "fame" increase each time ten people visit me.

01:17.285 --> 01:20.320
My self-esteem is tied to "sexiness", "friendliness",...

01:20.579 --> 01:22.435
..."karma" and "kindness" statistics.

01:23.090 --> 01:27.393
It's so easy to get lost in the pseudo love and affection Cyworld offers...

01:27.778 --> 01:30.402
...and not easy to find a way back to the world.
