00:00.501 --> 00:02.722
So, commencement day arrives.

00:04.183 --> 00:05.322
Your work begins.

00:06.264 --> 00:09.331
Work that will not be always joyful to you.

00:10.453 --> 00:12.903
Labor that may not always fulfill you.

00:13.966 --> 00:17.540
And days that will seem like one damn thing after the other.

00:18.937 --> 00:25.549
It's true, you will now work every day for the rest of your lives.

00:26.719 --> 00:27.677
That full-time job,...

00:29.110 --> 00:30.961
...your career as human beings,...

00:31.641 --> 00:34.327
...and as Americans, and as graduates of Yale...

00:35.536 --> 00:39.059
...is to stand on the fulcrum between fear and faith.

00:40.156 --> 00:41.738
Fear at your back,...

00:43.065 --> 00:43.912
...faith in front of you.

00:45.575 --> 00:46.564
Which way will you lean?

00:47.929 --> 00:49.011
Which way will you move?

00:50.437 --> 00:51.077
Move forward.

00:52.145 --> 00:56.854
Move ever forward, and tweet out a picture of the results.

00:58.395 --> 01:01.408
It may make you as famous as Sam Tsui.

01:02.579 --> 01:04.850
Thank you and congratulations!
