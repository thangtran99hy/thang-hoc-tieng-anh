00:08.881 --> 00:10.757
This year is not last year.

00:11.393 --> 00:12.328
This year is different.

00:13.590 --> 00:18.143
Time has its way of rolling forward and changing everything in the process,...

00:18.837 --> 00:20.958
...changing everything including you.

00:22.050 --> 00:22.848
The things you know.

00:23.065 --> 00:23.965
The things you want.

00:24.409 --> 00:25.337
The things you can do.

00:26.872 --> 00:30.000
This year, you can do more than just let those changes happen.

00:30.692 --> 00:34.682
You can remember all that life's struggles have taught you about being resilient,...

00:35.685 --> 00:37.913
...that's a beautiful promise you can make to yourself.

00:38.453 --> 00:40.902
To rebound from anything that has challenged you.

00:41.365 --> 00:44.341
To remember that it's not what happens to you that matters,...

00:44.807 --> 00:46.837
...but who you become in response.

00:47.467 --> 00:48.896
To leave the past in the past.

00:49.630 --> 00:54.386
To remind yourself every day how full of promise every minute is right now.

00:55.867 --> 00:58.555
You must not forget all the ways that you are a leader...

00:59.143 --> 01:00.984
...or underestimate the things you can do.

01:01.493 --> 01:04.097
It's so easy to think that your strengths don't matter...

01:04.504 --> 01:06.168
...or that you're not as good as you'd like to be.

01:06.543 --> 01:09.725
It's so easy to focus on the ways you let yourself down.

01:11.022 --> 01:13.413
But this year is its own new year.

01:14.331 --> 01:15.876
You can choose to believe in yourself.

01:16.281 --> 01:18.535
You can look for beauty in everything.

01:19.900 --> 01:24.947
You can be mindful of the purpose that you bring to every single thing that matters...

01:25.372 --> 01:27.546
...and the power that comes from that purpose.

01:28.449 --> 01:31.113
What's different now is that you are different.

01:31.596 --> 01:34.708
You are wiser in all the ways that time makes us wise.

01:35.171 --> 01:39.183
You are braver in all the ways that life compels us to be brave.

01:40.377 --> 01:42.003
That's what's different about this year.

01:42.651 --> 01:44.587
The things experience has taught you.

01:45.053 --> 01:48.192
The way you know that opportunity is only there if you look for it,...

01:48.755 --> 01:51.476
...that believing in your own strength makes it real.

01:51.999 --> 01:55.881
And that the only way to make the most of your one precious life...

01:56.307 --> 01:59.412
...is to discover what you want, and go get it.
