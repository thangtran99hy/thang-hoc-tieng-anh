So, who's your favorite movie star?

00:05.841 --> 00:07.615
I used to love Arnold Schwarzenegger,...

00:07.791 --> 00:11.240
...but now that he's a politician, he's not making movies anymore.

00:11.457 --> 00:13.927
Yeah, I always loved his movies, too.

00:14.350 --> 00:17.644
I guess now I really like watching Leonardo DiCaprio a lot.

00:17.881 --> 00:21.375
Hmm. Yes, he's definitely a really good actor,...

00:21.650 --> 00:23.886
...but I think I prefer Matt Damon to him.

00:24.395 --> 00:28.104
Yes, now that you mention it, Matt Damon is also one of my favorites.

00:28.331 --> 00:33.247
I think his first big movie "Good Will Hunting" is one of my all-time favorites.

00:33.471 --> 00:37.323
Me too! I guess I like both him and Leonardo DiCaprio best!

00:37.615 --> 00:39.984
I think we have similar tastes in actors.

00:40.157 --> 00:40.901
Yes, we do!
