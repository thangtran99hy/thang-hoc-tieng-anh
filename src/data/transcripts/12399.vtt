00:02.543 --> 00:03.779
Strangely enough,...

00:04.031 --> 00:08.032
...winning millions in the lottery can be the worst thing that ever happened to you.

00:08.604 --> 00:12.127
The money can strain relationships with your spouse and relatives.

00:12.607 --> 00:15.159
It can turn your friends and neighbors into leeches.

00:15.698 --> 00:17.126
It can ruin your privacy.

00:17.682 --> 00:21.085
It can cause security problems and threaten your physical safety.

00:21.754 --> 00:25.110
Paradoxically, it can lead you down the road to bankruptcy.

00:25.830 --> 00:28.470
So if you win a multi - million dollar prize,...

00:29.032 --> 00:32.330
...don't tell anyone or sign ticket. Act casual.

00:32.993 --> 00:35.564
Copy ticket and put in a safe deposit box.

00:36.319 --> 00:38.947
Contact a tax attorney and financial planner.

00:39.747 --> 00:42.079
Open a blind trust to maintain privacy.

00:42.907 --> 00:45.100
Tie up any financial loose ends.

00:45.717 --> 00:47.363
Draft or update your will.

00:47.987 --> 00:50.102
Move to a house with security guards.

00:50.574 --> 00:53.977
Last, wait a little longer - tell spouse last.

00:55.181 --> 00:56.506
Cheated by the Lottery.

00:57.519 --> 01:00.365
A redneck buys a lottery ticket and wins.

01:00.871 --> 01:03.865
He goes to claim it and his ticket number is verified.

01:04.243 --> 01:07.114
He says, "Give me my two billion won."

01:07.569 --> 01:10.544
The lottery representative replied, "Sorry, sir.

01:10.865 --> 01:12.805
We'll give you a hundred million won today...

01:13.095 --> 01:16.086
...and then you'll get the rest spread out for the next 19 years."

01:16.770 --> 01:20.013
The redneck said, "Oh, no. I want it all now!"

01:20.525 --> 01:23.513
Again, the man explains how the payment works.

01:24.029 --> 01:28.025
The furious redneck screams out, "Look! I want my money!...

01:28.440 --> 01:31.503
...If you're not going to give me my two billion won right now,...

01:31.814 --> 01:33.865
...then I want my thousand won bill back."
