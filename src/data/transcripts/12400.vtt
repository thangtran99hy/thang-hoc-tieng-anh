00:03.084 --> 00:04.085
You are a brand.

00:04.442 --> 00:06.785
No matter what you think, when people hear your name,...

00:06.953 --> 00:09.041
...they conjure up some association with it.

00:09.481 --> 00:12.385
When people see you, an emotional response is evoked.

00:12.841 --> 00:14.772
Like it or not, you, your good name,...

00:14.910 --> 00:17.211
...and your reputation truly are a brand.

00:17.799 --> 00:19.968
Does your brand shout "cutting-edge", "with it",...

00:20.194 --> 00:22.906
..."original" and "revolutionary" or something else?

00:23.723 --> 00:28.709
Some hip stylish and cool brands include Starbucks, Apple, Virgin and Prada.

00:29.439 --> 00:30.661
Could you be a cool brand?

00:31.289 --> 00:31.983
Do you want to be?

00:32.509 --> 00:33.185
What would it take?

00:33.816 --> 00:35.693
When people think of you, will words like...

00:35.846 --> 00:40.007
..."innovative" or "world-class" or "unique" or "fresh" infuse their minds?

00:41.018 --> 00:43.900
What would it take for you to become the Starbucks of your team...

00:44.355 --> 00:45.906
...or the Apple of your workplace?

00:46.502 --> 00:49.513
How could you become so strikingly great at what you do...

00:49.852 --> 00:52.388
...and who you are and what you stand for...

00:52.704 --> 00:55.341
... that everyone around you adores everything about you?

00:56.135 --> 00:59.815
When asked what makes a cool brand, most people answer "authenticity,...

01:00.059 --> 01:03.799
...originality, and uniqueness", but that's what they are striving for.

01:04.342 --> 01:08.026
They don't want to be seen as having the same type of brands as everyone else.

01:08.903 --> 01:11.479
Authenticity, originality and uniqueness.

01:11.944 --> 01:14.309
So, if you want your personal brand to be embraced,...

01:14.625 --> 01:16.952
...then be real, be honest, and be yourself.

01:17.482 --> 01:20.629
If you or your company's brand doesn't inherently have these traits,...

01:20.943 --> 01:22.652
...please, don't attempt to be cool.

01:23.284 --> 01:26.685
You'll look like you're having a mid - life crisis, and you will be laughed at.
