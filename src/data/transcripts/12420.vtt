One of the most controversial topics in Korea...

00:06.664 --> 00:10.594
... revolves around the teaching of English and foreign English teachers working here.

00:11.172 --> 00:15.475
On one hand, there are some of the famous Korean professors of English education,...

00:15.814 --> 00:20.018
...members of activist groups, media elites, and conservative traditionalists...

00:20.275 --> 00:22.248
... who feel English is a toxic language...

00:22.528 --> 00:25.593
...that kills the local language and culture everywhere it goes.

00:26.088 --> 00:27.670
On the contrary, many people,...

00:27.888 --> 00:30.821
...especially high level government and business professionals...

00:31.170 --> 00:35.047
... that argue that without high skill in English as an international language,...

00:35.372 --> 00:40.563
...Korea would not do as well as it has in the international economic and scientific arena.

00:41.461 --> 00:44.459
Therefore Koreans must continue to improve in English...

00:44.678 --> 00:48.264
...at all levels in all fields to strengthen national competitiveness.

00:49.190 --> 00:53.372
Often how people react to English depends on their first experiences with it.

00:54.271 --> 00:58.441
If their teachers liked English and infected students with their enthusiasm,...

00:58.843 --> 01:02.949
...then frequently those students continue to excel in English throughout their whole life.

01:03.609 --> 01:08.037
Korea has some truly excellent and well - qualified foreign and native - born instructors.

01:08.453 --> 01:11.762
It also has some who are not excellent, but excrement.

01:12.483 --> 01:16.388
The challenge is how to hire only the qualified and pay them appropriately.

01:16.849 --> 01:20.599
Until a way to prevent the bad and unqualified ones from being employed...

01:20.689 --> 01:24.343
...by disreputable institutes and illegal brokers is found,...

01:24.933 --> 01:28.546
...it's "caveat emptor" for all students of English.
