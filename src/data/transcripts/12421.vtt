Tom Hanks's movie, "Cast Away", is a great tale, entertaining, and has a good message.

00:09.022 --> 00:12.305
Only one problem, the beach in the movie was clean.

00:12.893 --> 00:16.414
In four years, only one piece of junk drifted ashore.

00:16.859 --> 00:18.560
Now there's a real fairy tale!

00:19.234 --> 00:23.312
In real life, a castaway would have more than a volleyball for company.

00:23.847 --> 00:28.124
He would have the entire Wilson clan, an extended Spalding family,...

00:28.377 --> 00:30.116
...and a set of off-brand cousins.

00:30.569 --> 00:34.199
He would also have a whole pile of slippers and sneakers to go with them.

00:34.875 --> 00:37.673
Is size a problem? Just wait a few days.

00:38.380 --> 00:41.467
Catching rainwater in coconut shells? Please.

00:41.840 --> 00:46.239
In four years, Hanks would have enough bottles and containers to stock a bar.

00:46.831 --> 00:49.833
Why waste energy trying to spear fish with a stick?

00:50.296 --> 00:53.631
It's far easier to net them with the discarded fishing nets that would...

00:53.743 --> 00:55.725
...almost certainly be on that beach.

00:56.445 --> 00:59.712
The fire - starting scene was funny, but in reality...

00:59.972 --> 01:04.792
...there are lighters washed onto beaches around the world and some still contain butane.

01:05.608 --> 01:09.983
Plastic fishing floats litters virtually every tropical beach in the world.

01:10.619 --> 01:12.749
Coming in various shapes and sizes,...

01:13.037 --> 01:17.389
...and lashed together with the thousands of feet of rope that would also have washed ashore,...

01:17.685 --> 01:20.121
...Hanks could have made an unsinkable boat.

01:20.779 --> 01:24.472
With the stuff lying on beaches today, you could build a whole house,...

01:24.737 --> 01:29.063
...complete with furniture, and as the movie showed, a real outhouse.
