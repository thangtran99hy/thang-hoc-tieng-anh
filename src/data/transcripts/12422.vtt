Real - Life Castaway : Philip Quarll, Marooned in 1675.

00:08.087 --> 00:13.320
In 1725, Edward Dorrington - an 18th - century trader from Bristol, England -...

00:13.783 --> 00:18.365
...rowed from his anchored ship toward an emerald green Pacific island with a craggy,...

00:18.498 --> 00:20.181
...irregular and dangerous shoreline.

00:20.847 --> 00:24.266
Landing on the lush, beautiful, and supposedly uninhabited island,...

00:24.723 --> 00:29.351
...he found a single hand - fashioned thatched hut situated near a deep forest.

00:30.019 --> 00:31.583
Soon the island's sole resident,...

00:31.861 --> 00:37.362
...an old Englishman with a flowing white beard and hair covering his shoulders and naked belly appeared.

00:37.904 --> 00:39.301
With a tame monkey at his side,...

00:39.683 --> 00:42.934
...the old man prepared a dinner for his welcome guests - soup,...

00:43.214 --> 00:49.537
...meat and fish - set out on a tablecloth made of a ship's sail and served up in plates of gleaming seashell.

00:50.389 --> 00:53.093
The delicious meal was a masterpiece of simplicity,...

00:53.495 --> 00:56.148
...created by a man keenly in touch with his environment.

00:56.914 --> 01:01.651
The castaway was Philip Quarll, a former sailor, trader, husband, and vagabond.

01:02.430 --> 01:07.383
He had presided for 50 years as solitary monarch over his tiny island of monkeys...

01:07.703 --> 01:10.900
...and pomegranate fields far off the coast of Mexico.

01:11.423 --> 01:13.003
Though his life had been lonely,...

01:13.296 --> 01:18.207
...he explained that he had ceased thinking of himself as a victim and was not in need of rescue.

01:18.921 --> 01:21.928
Quarll had no intention of abandoning his island cell.

01:22.292 --> 01:23.399
Over a half - century,...

01:23.665 --> 01:26.945
...the shipwrecked stranger had become a self - sufficient hermit.
