Many people take their right to privacy for granted.

00:07.430 --> 00:10.323
But most don't realize that this right doesn't extend to the...

00:10.452 --> 00:14.335
... place where they spend most of their waking hours: their workplace.

00:15.070 --> 00:17.964
Privacy is one of the most violated principles.

00:18.629 --> 00:21.035
People do realize monitoring goes on,...

00:21.457 --> 00:26.278
...but most individuals are unaware of how pervasive the lack of privacy is.

00:27.067 --> 00:33.507
Monitoring employees electronically and in other ways is a growing part of the way companies do business.

00:34.157 --> 00:38.504
Some 76% of employers monitor workers' Web connections,...

00:38.976 --> 00:43.019
... while 50% store and monitor employees' computer files.

00:43.415 --> 00:47.982
Employers monitor for three main reasons: legal liability issues,...

00:48.246 --> 00:50.999
...employee productivity, and security breaches.

00:51.442 --> 00:54.907
For example, e-mail creates a written business record,...

00:55.215 --> 00:57.779
...and employers are becoming increasingly aware that...

00:57.892 --> 01:02.780
... e-mail and Internet activity is the electronic equivalent of DNA evidence.

01:03.655 --> 01:07.389
More than half of all employers block unauthorized phone numbers,...

01:07.709 --> 01:11.709
...and monitor the amount of time spent on the phone and the numbers dialed.

01:12.419 --> 01:16.109
More than 80% of the employers who monitor these activities...

01:16.345 --> 01:18.877
...notify employees about what they are doing.

01:19.687 --> 01:23.394
Employers use video surveillance in an effort to prevent theft,...

01:23.516 --> 01:25.065
...violence and sabotage.

01:25.593 --> 01:29.508
Again more than half of all employers use video monitoring.

01:29.941 --> 01:33.841
Of those, 85% notify workers of the practice.

01:34.299 --> 01:39.367
However, video surveillance cameras may be installed in many areas of the workplace,...

01:39.779 --> 01:43.169
...including locker rooms, leading to a lack of privacy.

01:43.776 --> 01:48.559
We may not live in Orwell's 1984, but big brother is watching.
