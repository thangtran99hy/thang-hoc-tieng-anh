I'm James Williams with Discovery News,...

00:07.375 --> 00:08.406
...this is Uncle Sam,...

00:08.784 --> 00:13.348
...and this is James Heintze, Librarian Emeritus at American University in Washington, DC,...

00:13.629 --> 00:16.705
...and he's gonna give us the story on the real Uncle Sam.

00:16.886 --> 00:21.364
Uncle Sam is one of the most interesting and popular American icons...

00:22.187 --> 00:26.515
...whose origin lies in a meat - packing plant in Troy, New York.

00:27.087 --> 00:31.785
In 1812, a government inspector with the name of Elbert Anderson...

00:31.873 --> 00:34.083
...was purchasing meat from this factory...

00:34.789 --> 00:36.909
...whose manager was Sam Wilson.

00:39.647 --> 00:42.257
When they packed the meat in their oak barrels,...

00:42.464 --> 00:51.835
...they stamped the barrels E . A . for the name Elbert Anderson and U . S . as United States government stores.

00:52.473 --> 01:00.958
But a number of workers in the factory got together and decided to, as a joke,...

01:01.593 --> 01:04.071
...refer to the U . S . as Uncle Sam.

01:04.475 --> 01:07.305
That joke spread throughout the entire factory...

01:07.480 --> 01:11.812
...and also throughout the town of Troy, New York.

01:12.453 --> 01:14.570
And eventually, throughout New England.

01:14.831 --> 01:17.474
As early as the late 1820s,...

01:17.717 --> 01:21.735
...individuals were referring to the US government already as Uncle Sam.

01:22.551 --> 01:27.042
In the 1830s, people were asking the question throughout New England,...

01:27.163 --> 01:30.161
"What did Sam Wilson actually look like?"

01:30.755 --> 01:37.998
And the caricaturist depicted him as a rather tall man with a thin stature.

01:38.763 --> 01:44.423
And that seemed to catch on. Perhaps he really was very tall and thin.

01:44.950 --> 01:48.869
But that character would continue on throughout the 19th century.

01:49.375 --> 01:52.008
Happy birthday United States and happy birthday Uncle Sam.
