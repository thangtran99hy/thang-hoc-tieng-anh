Are you male, 30 +, and still not hitched?

00:06.390 --> 00:09.074
If you think that life begins at 30 for a man -...

00:09.361 --> 00:13.320
...that good men, like good wine, age well - then it's time to think ahead.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.707
Although marriage isn't out of the question,...

00:16.067 --> 00:18.022
...what lies ahead is no easy road.

00:18.561 --> 00:20.933
The time when men who possessed the three "H's"...

00:21.202 --> 00:26.305
...-Height, High income, and High level of education - were seen as hot properties are gone.

00:27.051 --> 00:31.135
Women aren't interested in workaholic men trying to raise their professional value.

00:31.658 --> 00:36.405
A recent survey revealed that 70% of the thirtysomething men want to get married.

00:36.788 --> 00:40.527
However, with each passing year, it's going to be increasingly difficult.

00:41.054 --> 00:45.275
Surprisingly, women in their 20s are especially harsh in their appraisal of men...

00:45.633 --> 00:47.713
...who have remained single well into their 30s.

00:48.365 --> 00:50.043
Here're a few typical comments:...

00:50.963 --> 00:53.833
"If a guy's over 30 and still living with his parents,...

00:54.193 --> 00:56.533
...people are going to be saying that he's a mama's boy."

00:56.923 --> 00:59.632
"There's a single guy in my office who's 37,...

01:00.024 --> 01:05.009
...but I bet he frequents the sex trade, so it's repulsive for me even to sit next to him."

01:05.627 --> 01:08.962
"A 36 - year - old in the accounting department is kind of creepy...

01:09.291 --> 01:12.703
...because he just seems like someone who has absolutely no sex drive."

01:13.736 --> 01:16.144
Men may say, "he's a good guy anyway,"...

01:16.525 --> 01:20.149
...but women aren't charitable in assessing a man's value as a potential mate.

01:20.593 --> 01:26.244
The harsh reality for 30 + men is the possibility of single-handedly caring for aging parents,...

01:26.624 --> 01:28.425
...perhaps even having to quit his work.

01:29.050 --> 01:30.378
Even without ailing parents,...

01:30.730 --> 01:34.163
...a single man must still save a large amount of money for retirement.

01:34.571 --> 01:39.273
And then he'll face a long and lonely time until at last, life retires from him.
