00:04.001 --> 00:07.465
Presently, Korea maintains a mandatory draft system...

00:07.734 --> 00:13.800
...under which all able-bodied men over 20 must serve in the military for 24 to 27 months.

00:14.393 --> 00:16.483
But this will change by 2020 ...

00:16.775 --> 00:21.344
...as the Army intends to rely on volunteers for 80 percent of its new recruits...

00:21.615 --> 00:23.875
... by phasing out mandatory conscription.

00:24.661 --> 00:31.659
Currently, volunteers represent about 38 percent of the 570,000 strong ground forces.

00:32.189 --> 00:37.747
Accordingly, the ratio of volunteer soldiers will be increased to 50 percent in 2010,...

00:38.256 --> 00:42.843
...65 percent in 2015 and 80 percent in 2020.

00:43.653 --> 00:48.347
The Army also plans to increase the number of non - commissioned officers (NCOs)...

00:48.711 --> 00:50.819
...to some 40 percent by 2020,...

00:51.415 --> 00:57.214
...offsetting the planned reduction of its enlisted soldiers under a 15 - year military reform package.

00:57.910 --> 00:59.855
To maintain quality NCOs,...

01:00.194 --> 01:04.617
...the Army is considering implementing a "salaried NCO employment plan",...

01:05.046 --> 01:08.243
...under which enlisted soldiers who complete their service period...

01:08.633 --> 01:12.882
...can serve longer in the military as NCOs for up to two more years.

01:13.572 --> 01:15.188
Over the next 15 years,...

01:15.463 --> 01:21.079
...the Army plans to build "smaller but stronger" units equipped with high-tech weapons systems.

01:21.713 --> 01:27.263
The overall goal for all services is cutting 190,000 soldiers by 2020...

01:27.731 --> 01:32.061
...to make a force of some 500,000 from the current 690,000.

01:32.735 --> 01:33.384
Meanwhile,...

01:33.655 --> 01:40.232
...the Army plans to more than double the number of female officers (currently 3.5% of all officers)...

01:40.594 --> 01:43.497
...by 4,000 to 7,000 by 2020;...

01:43.982 --> 01:49.547
...moreover, female officers will be able to serve in 16 of the 19 Army branches.
