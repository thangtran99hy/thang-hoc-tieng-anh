When buying a car, many people tend to put more energy into its color than any other thing.

00:09.098 --> 00:12.069
Buyers should think about what they will use their car for.

00:12.422 --> 00:15.224
They should ask: "How many people do I need to transport?",...

00:15.525 --> 00:19.682
..."What kind of driving do I most often do?", "How long is my commute?",...

00:19.954 --> 00:23.379
..."What kind of gas mileage do I need?" But they rarely do.

00:23.829 --> 00:24.971
In too many cases,...

00:25.131 --> 00:29.787
...people choose a car because it has an eye-catching style or it is a trendy favorite.

00:30.289 --> 00:33.408
Car makers know that they can strongly influence sales...

00:33.561 --> 00:37.688
...by selecting colors that appeal to the buyer's personality and self image.

00:38.703 --> 00:42.879
