Texas, isn't it?

00:19.723 --> 00:20.291
No!

00:25.047 --> 00:25.970
I'm a foreigner.

00:26.729 --> 00:27.701
Slow down, though.

00:27.858 --> 00:30.137
Few days ago, I was in Japan.

00:30.373 --> 00:31.718
I just moved to here.

00:32.479 --> 00:33.691
And you American,...

00:34.379 --> 00:39.923
...you should be more kindly to speak English to me.

00:40.161 --> 00:42.479
I can't understand your broken English.

00:42.783 --> 00:45.485
Please, I'm an audience, you know.

00:45.575 --> 00:46.369
I'm a guest.

00:52.628 --> 00:54.653
I'm a guest from another country.

00:56.563 --> 01:00.093
The Americans are people from everywhere.

01:02.857 --> 01:03.700
Only Indian!

01:22.715 --> 01:23.520
Real Americans.

01:23.820 --> 01:25.590
Only Indian.

01:27.925 --> 01:29.689
You come from another country.

01:29.833 --> 01:31.311
I come from another country.

01:31.659 --> 01:32.953
We are the same.

01:33.347 --> 01:36.211
But you came here before me.

01:37.247 --> 01:37.962
More kind.

01:38.802 --> 01:40.210
This is your business, okay?

01:46.215 --> 01:48.829
Okay, put your name.
