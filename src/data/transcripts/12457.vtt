All my family has been instrumental and in particular, my mother...

00:04.139 --> 00:08.381
...who, you know, I was a young person getting into all sorts of trouble.

00:08.990 --> 00:10.699
Anything I showed interest in,...

00:10.813 --> 00:16.690
...any little, you know, passing statement I said about, "Oh, that looks interesting."

00:16.813 --> 00:21.907
Whether it be an art class or a team sport or the Olympics.

00:21.995 --> 00:23.839
My mom found a way to get me involved.

00:24.153 --> 00:31.910
And that perseverance on her behalf is what has enabled me to live this dream over and over again.

00:32.034 --> 00:33.603
Without the support of my mom,...

00:33.967 --> 00:39.243
...just giving me every opportunity that she could find in the community in Winnipeg,...

00:40.303 --> 00:42.418
...I wouldn't be here today without her support.

00:42.517 --> 00:46.071
And I encourage all parents to, you know, when your kids say something like,...

00:46.153 --> 00:49.983
..."Oh, that looks really cool" or "Wow! What's that like?",...

00:50.253 --> 00:51.833
...find a way to get your kid involved...

00:51.915 --> 00:59.083
...because you never know if they're gonna go with it when you water their little seed of curiosity.

01:01.116 --> 01:05.832
For something that was really sort of the essence of what the Olympic sport is about,...

01:05.896 --> 01:08.083
...it's about being the best you can possibly be...

01:08.169 --> 01:10.037
...and in this case, being the best she'd ever been.

01:10.129 --> 01:13.957
Remember to dream and don't be afraid of trying.

01:14.116 --> 01:16.411
You never know where something's going to lead you.
