Welcome back.

00:01.554 --> 00:07.615
The debate rages on between which is the better smartphone, Android phones or iPhones.

00:08.072 --> 00:11.919
But one company in China may have just thrown a third option into the mix.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.052
It's called the GooApple.

00:15.495 --> 00:18.187
The iPhone: Considered a marvel of the modern age.

00:18.523 --> 00:19.751
Elegant and refined.

00:20.133 --> 00:22.875
A streamlined finish and a cute little Android on the back.

00:23.497 --> 00:23.997
GooApple?

00:24.581 --> 00:28.563
That's right. It seems there's a new rip-off of the iPhone hitting the markets in China.

00:29.253 --> 00:30.323
It looks like an iPhone,...

00:30.393 --> 00:31.608
...it feels like an iPhone,...

00:32.009 --> 00:33.267
...but it's not an iPhone.

00:33.776 --> 00:36.196
Products like these are known as shanzhai bootlegs.

00:36.591 --> 00:39.971
Shanzhai literally means in Chinese, "mountain stronghold".

00:40.567 --> 00:45.497
It's a reference to historical warlord hideouts that existed outside government control.

00:46.010 --> 00:48.982
Though you can be sure Genghis Khan never had one of these.

00:49.441 --> 00:51.291
It runs on Android 2.2...

00:51.667 --> 00:55.191
...but has been heavily modified to look like a typical iPhone OS.

00:55.803 --> 01:01.165
The GooApple, a mash-up of Google and Apple, is expected to go for about 200 US dollars.

01:01.725 --> 01:03.735
