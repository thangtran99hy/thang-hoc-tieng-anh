00:18.033 --> 00:20.957
Let's talk about manias.

00:22.127 --> 00:23.814
Let's start with Beatle mania.

00:25.873 --> 00:31.781
Hysterical teenagers, crying, screaming, pandemonium.

00:34.793 --> 00:35.741
Sports mania.

00:36.626 --> 00:37.942
Deafening crowds,...

00:39.389 --> 00:40.591
...all for one idea:...

00:41.142 --> 00:43.875
...get the ball in the net.

00:45.569 --> 00:47.167
Okay, religious mania.

00:47.685 --> 00:48.605
There's rapture.

00:49.126 --> 00:50.018
There's weeping.

00:50.709 --> 00:52.078
There're visions.

00:52.437 --> 00:53.685
Manias can be good.

00:54.598 --> 00:56.364
Manias can be alarming.

00:57.547 --> 00:59.519
Or manias can be deadly.

01:03.371 --> 01:04.886
The world has a new mania:...

01:05.388 --> 01:07.424
...a mania for learning English.

01:07.994 --> 01:13.378
Listen as Chinese students practice their English by screaming it.

01:13.471 --> 01:14.873
Change my life!

01:15.137 --> 01:17.745
I want to change my life.

01:17.924 --> 01:20.747
I don't want to let my parents down.

01:20.942 --> 01:24.169
I don't want to let my parents down.

01:24.339 --> 01:27.437
I don't ever want to let my country down.

01:27.681 --> 01:31.177
I don't ever want to let my country down.

01:31.306 --> 01:32.768
Most importantly...

01:33.061 --> 01:34.827
Most importantly...

01:34.921 --> 01:37.471
I don't want to let myself down.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.156
I don't want to let myself down.

01:40.269 --> 01:43.153
How many people are trying to learn English worldwide?

01:43.672 --> 01:45.733
2 billion of them.

01:45.951 --> 01:47.692
A t-shirt.

01:47.997 --> 01:49.475
A dress.

01:50.151 --> 01:57.203
In Latin America, in India, in Southeast Asia, and most of all in China.

01:57.957 --> 02:04.013
If you are a Chinese student, you start learning English in the third grade by law.

02:04.811 --> 02:11.555
That's why this year, China will become the world's largest English - speaking country.
