00:03.037 --> 00:05.921
I've been working hard to get promoted but no one's noticed.

00:06.237 --> 00:07.221
What am I doing wrong?

00:08.128 --> 00:10.715
To get to an early start in climbing the corporate ladder,...

00:11.053 --> 00:12.818
...don't guess, go to the source!

00:13.373 --> 00:15.857
Ask your boss what you'd need to do to get ahead.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.684
Ask about what kind of performance is expected,...

00:19.059 --> 00:20.863
...what projects you need to be working on,...

00:21.223 --> 00:23.176
...and what additional expertise you'll need.

00:23.949 --> 00:27.196
Look for ways that you can support what is most important to your boss...

00:27.511 --> 00:30.832
...by tackling the projects your boss least enjoys working on.

00:31.606 --> 00:33.141
To find out if your boss can help you,...

00:33.517 --> 00:36.804
...check his track record for sponsoring and promoting employees.

00:37.360 --> 00:43.068
If your boss talks proudly of his "alumni network" and how often it had provided valuable support to him,...

00:43.433 --> 00:45.327
...then do your best to join his network.

00:45.974 --> 00:48.498
Avoid putting all your eggs in your boss's basket.

00:49.060 --> 00:52.147
Develop a group of people who are invested in your success...

00:52.525 --> 00:56.549
...by serving on projects in other functional areas and with other managers.

00:57.237 --> 01:00.521
Take on the projects that no one else wants to touch. Why?

01:00.914 --> 01:04.102
Because any level of success will get you lots of visibility.

01:04.715 --> 01:07.526
But don't take an assignment with no chance of success.

01:08.091 --> 01:10.077
Get your boss engaged in your success,...

01:10.445 --> 01:13.175
...and you'll walk down the aisle to a more successful career.

01:13.714 --> 01:16.851
But remember not all bosses are prepared to support their people,...

01:17.245 --> 01:21.277
...so you might have to divorce your current one and go looking for a new partner.
