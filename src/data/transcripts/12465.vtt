00:02.155 --> 00:07.718
I roam the Web never leaving a trace, Prying and snooping, I feel no disgrace.

00:08.093 --> 00:13.663
No cookies or IP's can give me away, I go where I please, then enjoy my stay.

00:14.249 --> 00:19.805
Your e-mail or domain, I will uncover The more you conceal, the more I discover.

00:20.307 --> 00:22.572
Something to hide and prefer not to share?

00:23.101 --> 00:25.903
Too bad? I'll find it, so liars beware!!

00:26.625 --> 00:29.016
Wicked and naughty describes me the best,...

00:29.577 --> 00:32.286
...When my sleuthing talents are put to the test.

00:32.911 --> 00:35.241
I lurk uninvited, seeking to scare,...

00:35.717 --> 00:38.019
...Come search me out, that's if you dare!

00:38.883 --> 00:41.138
"Why won't she leave me alone?" you whine,...

00:41.543 --> 00:43.997
...I want some privacy while I'm online.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.755
Once you thought I was funny and smart,...

00:47.122 --> 00:49.710
...Now you're sure I'm a bitch with no heart!

00:50.479 --> 00:53.106
Has she the ability to invade my real life?

00:53.453 --> 00:56.234
Her skill to intrude causing panic and strife.

00:57.114 --> 00:59.323
You eye the shadows with fear and dread,...

00:59.677 --> 01:02.086
...Hiding from a woman who's one step ahead.

01:02.629 --> 01:04.874
But you and I won't meet face to face,...

01:05.221 --> 01:08.259
...I prowl only the corridors of cyberspace.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.375
You smile again; I can see you're relieved,...

01:11.925 --> 01:14.481
But can a cyber - stalker ever be believed?

01:15.089 --> 01:17.248
I hold my computer in the highest esteem,...

01:17.875 --> 01:20.913
...Because in this world, I'm stalker supreme.

01:21.583 --> 01:24.006
And one thing's for certain, come what may,...

01:24.373 --> 01:27.555
The art of cyberstalking is here to stay!!
