I presented a TV series this year,...

00:17.297 --> 00:22.075
...a four - part TV series for Channel 4 called "On Tour with the Queen"...

00:23.907 --> 00:30.419
...where I recreated the Queen's tour of 1953 - 54 of the Commonwealth.

00:31.099 --> 00:33.789
I can't swim and that looks precarious to me.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.079
I mean, I have to say it's probably one of the best jobs in my life.

00:47.472 --> 00:51.935
I think without a shadow of a doubt it was a very brave decision...

00:52.531 --> 00:57.343
...to get somebody like me to kind of shadow the Queen as it were...

00:58.207 --> 01:02.585
...because the Queen is the image of Britain to most people in the world.

01:03.960 --> 01:08.199
It came as quite a bit of a shock really to many of those in the former colonies.

01:09.563 --> 01:19.523
But I wanted to do the gig because the world still has a very 1950s - 60s kind of picture of Britain.

01:35.371 --> 01:35.854
What's your name?

01:36.057 --> 01:36.259
Bill.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.834
Hello, Bill. I'm Kwame.

01:37.897 --> 01:38.381
This is Angela

01:38.815 --> 01:39.566
Hello, Angela.

01:39.741 --> 01:44.452
People really, when I say I'm British, they go, "Pardon? I beg your pardon?"...

01:45.761 --> 01:48.050
...and then will ask me four times, you know...

01:48.381 --> 01:51.222
...and I'll have to kind of give my lineage before they accept it.

01:53.240 --> 01:58.813
Often when people would say, "Why is he asking about the Queen?",...

01:59.790 --> 02:02.757
...there'd be a little bit of anger actually sometimes because I'd be a bit like,...

02:02.847 --> 02:05.326
..."You know what? This is what we look like now."
