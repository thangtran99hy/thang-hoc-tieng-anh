00:00.749 --> 00:02.181
A Brighter Future.

00:02.930 --> 00:05.918
Do you think futurists can really predict what's going to happen?

00:06.361 --> 00:09.004
In fact, "futurists" don't predict the future.

00:09.552 --> 00:14.406
Instead, they pay a great deal of attention to trends and issues that will impact our future.

00:15.087 --> 00:19.099
They then ask people to consider the implications of those trends and issues...

00:19.360 --> 00:24.649
...for their business, industry, profession, government, or country, for themselves or for the world.

00:25.674 --> 00:29.275
As your family, group, or organization makes plans for the future,...

00:29.733 --> 00:31.784
...they need to see themselves in context.

00:32.302 --> 00:36.941
They must consider the political, economic, social, technological, environmental,...

00:37.256 --> 00:41.042
...demographic changes, and other forces that are likely to impact them.

00:41.728 --> 00:42.329
Likewise,...

00:42.740 --> 00:47.562
...they try to imagine how things will change because of those different forces working together...

00:47.860 --> 00:48.887
...or against each other.

00:49.750 --> 00:53.765
We might call those who pay attention to trends and issues as being "in touch".

00:54.075 --> 00:56.653
Those who don't are usually called "out of touch".

00:57.137 --> 01:01.208
Rather than flying blind, futurists help us see the airspace in front of us.

01:01.789 --> 01:03.687
They can help us develop scenarios and...

01:03.825 --> 01:06.457
...test our assumptions about the nature of the future.

01:07.264 --> 01:08.675
The World Future Society...

01:09.075 --> 01:14.247
...plays a key role in bringing people "in touch" with the future and together from many disciplines,...

01:14.473 --> 01:17.967
...ranging from education and medicine to technology and security...

01:18.279 --> 01:20.599
...help others see what the future may be like.
