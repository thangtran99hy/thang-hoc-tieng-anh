00:03.549 --> 00:08.157
Planning: Negotiation is a process, not a single meeting.

00:08.619 --> 00:10.200
Write down your objectives,...

00:10.662 --> 00:12.773
...needs; what you must get,...

00:13.256 --> 00:16.932
...wants; can be conceded if you get something in return,...

00:17.531 --> 00:23.234
...would be nice; bargaining chips. Try to anticipate the other side's desires.

00:24.353 --> 00:26.143
Five Steps to Negotiation.

00:26.831 --> 00:30.189
One. Engage in small talk and build trust.

00:30.981 --> 00:37.071
Two. Share and listen carefully to objectives. Be interested in a win-win outcome.

00:37.827 --> 00:41.461
Three. Conflict is natural and shouldn't be avoided.

00:42.005 --> 00:47.004
Work on the "needs" first, then "wants", finally resolve unimportant issues.

00:47.845 --> 00:52.875
Four. Expect change and adapt. Look for creative solutions.

00:53.325 --> 00:56.824
Be open to compromise. Always work for win-win.

00:57.507 --> 01:01.808
Five. After agreeing, write down the details of the agreement.

01:02.489 --> 01:03.934
Develop skills to...

01:04.532 --> 01:05.875
...diagnose conflict.

01:06.277 --> 01:08.627
Be effective in initiating confrontation.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.083
Listen to the other's point of view.

01:11.689 --> 01:14.427
Use problem solving to bring about a consensus.

01:15.379 --> 01:16.061
Remember:

01:16.823 --> 01:20.463
Try to please both parties by putting yourself in the other's shoes.

01:21.179 --> 01:23.414
Be willing to "own" part of the problem.

01:24.395 --> 01:27.731
Talking about your feelings is more effective than acting them out.

01:28.560 --> 01:31.382
Establish common goals and stay focused on them.

01:32.205 --> 01:36.341
Work for satisfactory solutions if the issues are important to you.

01:37.091 --> 01:41.444
When discussion ends, summarize decisions and develop next steps.
