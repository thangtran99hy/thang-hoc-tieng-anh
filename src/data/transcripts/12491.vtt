00:03.405 --> 00:05.877
Much has been written on Noblesse Oblige.

00:06.202 --> 00:10.883
Loosely translated, it means if you have wealth, power, prestige, and privilege:...

00:11.409 --> 00:13.320
You have social responsibilities.

00:13.789 --> 00:15.872
You must help those who are less fortunate.

00:16.425 --> 00:19.423
You must balance it by duty towards the less privileged.

00:20.047 --> 00:22.045
You should be role models of decency.

00:23.105 --> 00:25.301
Since many of us are Noblesse Oblige...

00:25.413 --> 00:28.578
...beginners and neither wealthy, nor powerful, nor privileged,...

00:28.907 --> 00:30.467
...how can we put it into practice?

00:31.207 --> 00:32.842
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,...

00:33.117 --> 00:37.295
...the wife of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy has some good advice:...

00:37.758 --> 00:39.074
Coddle bit players.

00:39.573 --> 00:42.924
Give proper respect to those who make your path smoother in life.

00:43.245 --> 00:46.332
Learn to recall the names, unprompted, of those you meet.

00:47.227 --> 00:50.219
Don't publicly criticize your enemies or opponents.

00:50.775 --> 00:56.764
Especially, don't bad-mouth people by e-mail: as electronic slurs can be endlessly forwarded.

00:57.296 --> 00:58.993
Don't sink to your enemy's level.

00:59.941 --> 01:02.129
Tap higher powers to help the helpless.

01:02.871 --> 01:07.392
When you cannot do more, look around 720 degrees for the solution.

01:08.081 --> 01:11.737
Don't be too proud to ask an influential friend to help the helpless-...

01:12.260 --> 01:13.999
...even if the two have never met.

01:15.005 --> 01:16.714
Turn the other silken cheek.

01:17.413 --> 01:19.969
Sometimes you must show people what you are made of...

01:20.078 --> 01:22.903
...by learning to let mild acts of ugliness pass.

01:24.019 --> 01:29.277
The classiest cash is the quietest. Quietly buy the fine things in life.

01:29.725 --> 01:33.447
Don't gab on about money, either yours or anyone else's.

01:34.191 --> 01:36.279
To be a cut above, don't cut.

01:36.905 --> 01:40.221
Even if your social status or connections somehow permit it,...

01:40.573 --> 01:44.308
...resist any temptation to leapfrog over more common folks.
