"It was just like Groundhog Day."

00:04.419 --> 00:08.282
This expression refers to the movie's theme of maddening repetition...

00:08.529 --> 00:14.037
...and perfectly sums up the human habit of making the same stupid mistakes over and over again.

00:14.703 --> 00:19.307
Groundhog Day concerns Bill Murray's character who is forced to live one day of his life...

00:19.432 --> 00:23.613
...over and over again until he changes into a more compassionate person.

00:24.439 --> 00:27.614
Imagine being asked, "What if there were no tomorrow?"

00:28.036 --> 00:30.459
You might answer, "No consequences!"

00:31.038 --> 00:34.919
If it were true you might embark on a wild night of reckless abandon,...

00:35.365 --> 00:38.817
...knowing that the next morning things will be undone and you can start over.

00:39.574 --> 00:43.430
Then ask yourself, "What would you do if you were stuck in one place,...

00:43.734 --> 00:46.621
...and every day was the same and nothing you did mattered?"

00:47.253 --> 00:49.685
Well, many of us behave in our jobs,...

00:49.783 --> 00:53.285
...schools, or relationships just as if we were stuck in time.

00:54.103 --> 00:55.625
The conclusion we might reach...

00:55.912 --> 00:59.573
... is that life is what we make of it and that we can make each day special...

01:00.015 --> 01:03.170
...or that we can waste time by becoming stuck in our routine.

01:03.963 --> 01:05.597
Last, it has been said,...

01:06.065 --> 01:11.423
..."For some a mistake is a lesson, for others it is a lifetime of the same lesson."

01:12.197 --> 01:14.682
What if we were stuck in a continuous time loop...

01:15.008 --> 01:19.123
....where we just made the same character driven mistakes over and over again.

01:19.868 --> 01:23.591
Would we have enough sense to get off this treadmill and change our lives?
