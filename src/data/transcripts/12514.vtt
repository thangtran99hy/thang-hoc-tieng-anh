00:06.187 --> 00:06.965
No AC?

00:07.436 --> 00:10.407
Before you die of heatstroke, try these cool tricks.

00:10.841 --> 00:14.880
You will need: a fan, ice, linen sheets,...

00:15.091 --> 00:20.097
...spicy food, wristbands, a bandanna, and a window exhaust fan.

00:20.563 --> 00:26.232
Step 1: Mimic the cooling effects of AC by putting a heaping bowl of ice in front of a fan.

00:26.723 --> 00:29.665
Hey, a half-assed air conditioner is better than no air conditioner.

00:30.283 --> 00:35.425
Step 2: Use linen sheets, which are twice as cool as cotton, the next best choice.

00:35.995 --> 00:37.807
Leave the bed unmade in the summer.

00:38.210 --> 00:41.669
Putting a heavy spread on it will only trap heat and prevent the sheets from airing out.

00:42.242 --> 00:44.810
Step 3: Eat spicy foods.

00:45.099 --> 00:48.056
They will make you sweat, which is your body's way of cooling you down.

00:48.680 --> 00:53.364
Step 4: Take warm baths or showers, which will trigger your body to cool off.

00:53.693 --> 00:55.767
If you take a cold one, the opposite will happen,...

00:55.839 --> 00:57.759
...and you'll end up hotter than before you bathed.

00:58.417 --> 01:01.786
Step 5: Wear wristbands that have been dunked in ice water...

01:01.863 --> 01:04.202
...and tie a cold wet bandanna around your neck.

01:04.560 --> 01:07.391
Keeping those areas chilled will cool off your entire body.

01:07.932 --> 01:11.900
Step 6: Stay hydrated by drinking a lot of cool water.

01:12.333 --> 01:16.063
Don't drink the water too cold, or your body will go into overdrive trying to warm you up.

01:16.737 --> 01:21.359
Step 7: Stick your bed linens in the freezer for a few hours before bedtime.

01:21.668 --> 01:23.789
At the very least, chill your pillowcases.

01:24.195 --> 01:27.676
Step 8: Suck hot air out and blow cold air in...

01:27.751 --> 01:30.311
...by putting an exhaust fan in one window, facing out...

01:30.655 --> 01:33.871
...and closing all the other windows except the ones in the room in which you're sleeping.

01:34.930 --> 01:39.657
Step 9: Soak a T-shirt in ice water, wring it out, and wear it to bed.

01:40.011 --> 01:41.145
You can also wet your hair.

01:41.501 --> 01:43.734
Hey, you may be a little damp but at least you're cool.

01:44.384 --> 01:45.003
Did you know?

01:45.566 --> 01:48.918
400 Americans die every year as a direct result of the heat.
