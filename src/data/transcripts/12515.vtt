Sony hopes to bring 3D to the masses with the PlayStation - branded 3D TV, it announced at E3 in Los Angeles.

00:07.563 --> 00:12.138
At 24 inches, Sony said the TV is aimed at dorm rooms, bedrooms and family dens.

00:12.525 --> 00:15.539
And that seems accurate as it would be too small for a large room.

00:16.171 --> 00:19.015
What Sony really boasts about is that in two - player mode,...

00:19.274 --> 00:21.526
...each player sees something different on the screen.

00:22.221 --> 00:24.189
Ordinarily, when we're playing two - player mode,...

00:24.419 --> 00:26.684
...it could be co-op or head-to-head, you use split - screen.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.981
With the new technology in this display,...

00:29.293 --> 00:34.030
...you could get full HD per person while you're wearing the glasses.

00:34.509 --> 00:36.467
While they wouldn't let us film the screen directly,...

00:36.557 --> 00:38.070
...I had the chance to try the effect.

00:38.404 --> 00:41.337
And it says if there are two screens placed on top of each other,...

00:41.732 --> 00:43.218
...and it did work as advertised,...

00:43.585 --> 00:47.189
...the first player sees one set of images while the second player sees another.

00:47.683 --> 00:49.046
Sony wouldn't say how it works,...

00:49.151 --> 00:51.855
...but it likely has to do with the active shutter glasses.

00:52.611 --> 00:57.199
The TV can play 1080p 3D movies which are playable on any PS3.

00:57.685 --> 01:00.151
It also has additional HDMI inputs.

01:00.995 --> 01:04.797
The screen did look a little dim but Sony said that's typical of 3D displays...

01:04.883 --> 01:07.161
...and it wasn't helped by the bright show floor lights.

01:07.825 --> 01:11.791
The PlayStation 3D display bundle comes with the TV, an HDMI cord,...

01:12.053 --> 01:16.282
...Resistance 3, and one set of active shutter glasses for 500 dollars.

01:16.725 --> 01:18.110
It goes on sale this fall.

01:18.749 --> 01:22.271
