00:03.075 --> 00:07.225
Face it. Unless you like kicking puppies and smacking babies,...

00:07.559 --> 00:09.337
...firing someone is not pleasant.

00:09.856 --> 00:12.949
The person doing the firing doesn't sleep well night before.

00:13.375 --> 00:17.149
They know it must be done, but often don't know quite what to do or say.

00:18.024 --> 00:18.924
What Do I Say?

00:19.663 --> 00:22.826
The best way to tell somebody is to just directly tell them.

00:23.349 --> 00:24.754
"We've decided to make a change."

00:24.998 --> 00:28.349
Or, "It's not working out, and we're going to need to let you go."

00:29.085 --> 00:31.915
People already know when a relationship is not going well,...

00:32.262 --> 00:34.231
...so most of the time they are expecting it.

00:35.104 --> 00:36.001
When Do I Say It?

00:36.724 --> 00:38.536
Not on a Friday, if you can help it.

00:39.077 --> 00:40.863
When you fire someone at the end of a week,...

00:41.105 --> 00:45.137
...you sentence them to two days, Saturday and Sunday, of self-torment.

00:45.811 --> 00:48.342
By releasing them into the world at the beginning of the week,...

00:48.687 --> 00:52.795
...they may actually have the time to make a few phone calls or set up a meeting or two.

00:53.935 --> 00:55.815
What Do We Do After I Say It?

00:56.645 --> 00:58.574
If they want to talk, listen to them.

00:58.897 --> 01:00.717
Don't argue, don't get defensive,...

01:00.957 --> 01:04.147
...and don't feel that you have to explain or justify your decision.

01:04.733 --> 01:06.075
You are the one in control.

01:06.615 --> 01:09.637
It is very helpful to anticipate their questions in advance.

01:10.087 --> 01:12.720
That way, you can put all the information in writing.

01:13.313 --> 01:14.770
After you answer their questions,...

01:15.099 --> 01:18.420
...simply give them the memo explaining what you have just told them.
