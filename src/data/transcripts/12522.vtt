00:04.047 --> 00:07.603
When hundreds of thousands of South Korean soldiers are drafted and...

00:07.749 --> 00:09.769
... forced to face a nuclear North Korea,...

00:10.229 --> 00:12.887
...does anyone have the right to be a conscientious objector?

00:13.495 --> 00:18.802
72% of Korean citizens are against any exemption for conscientious objectors.

00:19.595 --> 00:22.185
"A Korean man has the duty to protect his nation,"...

00:22.505 --> 00:25.035
...said an Association of Korean Veterans member.

00:25.783 --> 00:28.291
However, one government agency disagrees.

00:28.679 --> 00:31.834
The National Human Rights Commission of Korea has proposed...

00:31.996 --> 00:34.769
...that the Ministry of Defense and the National Assembly...

00:35.108 --> 00:38.461
..."find alternate forms of service for conscientious objectors...

00:38.878 --> 00:42.268
...for those who refuse to serve their obligatory military service."

00:43.255 --> 00:47.303
The NHRC is a Presidential body but has no legal powers.

00:47.597 --> 00:50.911
They proposed that "Freedom of conscience is a primary human right...

00:51.220 --> 00:54.997
...which cannot be violated even in the situation of national emergency."

00:55.295 --> 00:58.350
The Korean Defense Minister responded negatively saying,...

00:58.664 --> 01:02.362
..."We respect the recommendation of the NHRC but we will follow it...

01:02.529 --> 01:06.005
...only if the National Assembly establishes a related law."

01:06.553 --> 01:09.783
He suggested that any change should be in the far future.

01:10.266 --> 01:10.879
Interestingly,...

01:11.089 --> 01:14.646
...Korea has signed the United Nations Commission on Human Rights resolution...

01:14.993 --> 01:21.015
...1989 - 1959, which among other things allows the signing country's citizens "to have...

01:21.122 --> 01:23.523
...conscientious objections to military service...

01:23.879 --> 01:26.819
...as a legitimate exercise of the right to freedom of thought,...

01:27.140 --> 01:28.386
...conscience and religion."

01:28.930 --> 01:33.267
Perhaps most surprisingly, South Korea has imprisoned more conscientious objectors...

01:33.566 --> 01:36.646
...than all other countries combined since 1953.
