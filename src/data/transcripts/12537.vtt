Hi, I'm Bonnie Greer.

00:15.071 --> 00:17.466
I'm a playwright, novelist, commentator...

00:18.053 --> 00:20.553
...and I was born on the south side of Chicago.

00:21.040 --> 00:25.331
I've lived here since 1986 and I'm Deputy Chair of the British Museum.

00:25.947 --> 00:27.718
This is See Britain Through My Eyes.

00:32.961 --> 00:37.210
The British Museum is the ultimate Enlightenment institution.

00:39.045 --> 00:41.766
We hold a collection of seven million - plus objects...

00:42.113 --> 00:46.005
...and we hold them for all of the world, free to all of the world.

00:47.180 --> 00:49.953
So you walk through this dark aperture,...

00:50.032 --> 00:56.014
...this kind of classical Greek temple, the 18th century idea of the Enlightenment.

00:56.093 --> 00:58.431
It's dark and tiny.

00:58.713 --> 01:06.436
And suddenly the museum opens up, full of light, full of movement...

01:06.889 --> 01:10.661
...where you see people of all colors and nations.

01:11.183 --> 01:13.373
This is like a Tower of Babel in a sense.

01:13.718 --> 01:15.915
There's so many languages represented here.

01:26.069 --> 01:35.460
This museum embodies the notion that we better learn about our own culture in relation to other cultures.

01:37.448 --> 01:43.307
And so the colonial era actually turned London into what it still is today: a hub city.

01:44.323 --> 01:47.596
So that the notion of globalization, in its good sense,...

01:48.179 --> 01:50.491
...actually you could say began at this place...

01:50.861 --> 01:54.989
...where all the peoples of the world have left behind their story.

01:55.712 --> 02:00.531
And so it is right that this collection in this museum sits in the middle of that hub.
