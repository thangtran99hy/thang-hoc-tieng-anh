00:02.645 --> 00:06.833
Global warming is expected to change Earth's weather in dramatic ways.

00:07.161 --> 00:09.470
The best computer models predict the US,...

00:09.579 --> 00:11.799
...West Mediterranean nations and Brazil ...

00:12.029 --> 00:14.947
...will be "hot spots" that will get extremes at their worst.

00:15.787 --> 00:18.463
These areas will likely suffer more extended droughts,...

00:18.568 --> 00:20.795
...heavy rainfalls and longer heat waves.

00:21.675 --> 00:25.095
It's estimated that the expected global average temperature change...

00:25.393 --> 00:34.288
...will range from 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit, 1.4 degrees Celsius to 10.4 degrees Fahrenheit, 5.8 degrees Celsius.

00:34.881 --> 00:39.158
In Korea, the expected consequences of global warming will be very bad.

00:39.917 --> 00:40.779
In particular,...

00:41.081 --> 00:45.633
...the tropical night's phenomenon which is already very bad will get much worse...

00:45.890 --> 00:49.316
...as the average nighttime temperature is expected to greatly increase.

00:49.759 --> 00:54.221
When heat waves and their intensity, length, and occurrence increase; people die.

00:54.665 --> 00:59.693
For Korea, another negative impact will be much less predictable monsoon seasons.

01:00.149 --> 01:03.199
This will lead to more drought and at the same time more flooding, both...

01:03.341 --> 01:05.564
...of which will hurt food self-sufficiency.

01:06.297 --> 01:11.489
Sea level rise will cause Korea to lose land especially in the south and western areas.

01:12.205 --> 01:15.657
One way that Korea will do its part to slow down global warming...

01:15.912 --> 01:17.821
...will be to use more nuclear power...

01:18.078 --> 01:23.357
....to generate electricity rather than using oil and coal which produce greenhouse gases.

01:24.202 --> 01:26.763
Korea is also a leading producer of automobiles...

01:27.148 --> 01:29.699
...and is rich enough in both income and technology...

01:29.989 --> 01:33.351
...to produce and adopt hybrid and other alternative energy vehicles...

01:33.607 --> 01:35.913
...as new technologies become available.
