Tattoos are a touchy subject here,...

00:05.226 --> 00:07.693
"They're an insult to God!" blusters one man.

00:08.129 --> 00:10.889
More importantly, they clash with Confucian belief,...

00:11.111 --> 00:12.305
...which is still strong here.

00:12.853 --> 00:16.257
Most Koreans believe that their bodies are gifts from their ancestors,...

00:16.593 --> 00:18.031
...so they should not be tampered with.

00:18.494 --> 00:22.276
It's not surprising then that many Koreans are averse to having tattoos.

00:22.963 --> 00:24.040
In Europe in the past,...

00:24.323 --> 00:28.595
...tattoos were used to mark all kinds of criminals, slaves, and undesirables.

00:29.004 --> 00:30.966
Recently, tattoos are in fashion.

00:31.565 --> 00:34.392
One Korean living in London was shocked to observe that:

00:34.689 --> 00:38.356
"Seven out of ten people here wear a tattoo like a shirt or a hat.

00:39.177 --> 00:40.299
Are they all gangsters?

00:40.802 --> 00:44.233
In Korea, many people think only criminals have tattoos."

00:44.925 --> 00:47.230
Attitudes in Korea still aren't much different.

00:47.675 --> 00:50.986
Consequently, getting a tattoo in Korea is quite difficult...

00:51.255 --> 00:55.139
...especially because it's still illegal to give someone one without license.

00:55.891 --> 00:59.549
But that hasn't stopped one tattooist based in Hongik University area,...

00:59.996 --> 01:03.921
...who claims that most of his customers are regular people, mostly in their 20s.

01:04.587 --> 01:07.459
"There are many artists like musicians, dancers, actors,...

01:07.737 --> 01:11.781
...and painters among my customers, but I also have  inked university students,...

01:12.121 --> 01:14.031
...office workers and even housewives."

01:15.047 --> 01:18.309
Many Koreans do get tattooed temporarily when they're abroad.

01:18.670 --> 01:22.581
So tattoos are not that taboo at least when one is on vacation.

01:23.421 --> 01:25.951
Tattooists do have one final piece of advice,...

01:26.529 --> 01:28.697
..."Getting a tattoo is like getting married.

01:29.027 --> 01:31.189
You should be willing to live with your cartoon friend...

01:31.489 --> 01:32.911
'until death do you part'."
