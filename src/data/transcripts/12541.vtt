Every company takes security very seriously...

00:05.295 --> 00:11.318
...so that company PCs may not have floppy disk drives nor any CD or DVD writable drives.

00:11.835 --> 00:15.455
No one believes that their corporate computers don't have such devices...

00:15.695 --> 00:17.537
...because their company cannot afford them.

00:18.179 --> 00:23.344
The reality is that your company is deathly afraid of confidential corporate secrets leaking out.

00:24.041 --> 00:26.644
Moreover, some corporate notebooks won't work...

00:26.785 --> 00:29.925
...once they are away from the vicinity of the corporate wireless server...

00:30.259 --> 00:34.121
...and it makes it more difficult for industrial spies to steal valuable data.

00:34.999 --> 00:36.883
Even high storage USBs,...

00:37.224 --> 00:40.899
...may perform only half of their normal function in some corporate computers:

00:41.461 --> 00:43.599
...employees can read information stored in them...

00:43.957 --> 00:47.521
...but cannot download information from their PCs to USB.

00:48.404 --> 00:54.251
Some corporate e-mail systems are set up so that e-mails can be exchanged only among corporate PCs.

00:54.867 --> 00:58.243
In addition, corporate documents are automatically encoded,....

00:58.600 --> 01:00.341
...so outsiders cannot read them.

01:00.938 --> 01:06.039
They're stored only on corporate servers along with the names of employees who have accessed them.

01:06.627 --> 01:09.081
Then, if important documents are leaked,...

01:09.341 --> 01:11.293
...your company can find the guilty party.

01:12.286 --> 01:16.411
Yet, all this need for security hinders mobility and productivity.

01:17.045 --> 01:22.149
More insidiously, employees are reminded of just how little trust their company has in them.

01:23.106 --> 01:25.613
It's difficult to know which hurts morale more,...

01:25.985 --> 01:30.369
...the one bad apple that steals or leaks corporate secrets or Big Brother...

01:30.650 --> 01:35.375
...that watches and seeks to control its employees' every use of the tools of business.
