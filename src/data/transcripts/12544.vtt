Technology like the MP3 player is revolutionizing sports psychology...

00:08.610 --> 00:12.219
...as it allows athletes to harness the psychological benefits of music...

00:12.516 --> 00:15.207
...in enhancing athletic performance as never before.

00:16.117 --> 00:19.579
The benefits of music on exercise have been known since the days that...

00:19.772 --> 00:22.859
...galley slaves were forced to row to the rhythm of drum beats.

00:23.721 --> 00:27.713
But it's only in the past decade that this has been scientifically demonstrated.

00:28.538 --> 00:30.879
Music boosts performance in a number of ways.

00:31.239 --> 00:35.181
If you synchronize whatever activity you're engaging in to the tempo of music,...

00:35.542 --> 00:37.763
...there's a very clearly energetic effect.

00:38.135 --> 00:41.957
In other words, if you play music with a fast tempo, people work harder.

00:42.813 --> 00:46.993
Music also acts as a mood enhancer, which can put athletes in a "winning" mood.

00:47.481 --> 00:50.864
Music like "Eye of the Tiger" and the theme from the movie "Rocky"...

00:51.198 --> 00:55.040
...are basics that reflect athletes' personal goals to "seize their moment".

00:56.073 --> 00:59.891
Downloading music allows athletes to highly personalize to their music...

01:00.199 --> 01:02.689
...and individual training and competing program.

01:03.456 --> 01:05.673
Add that to shoes with sensors that...

01:05.800 --> 01:08.777
...pick up how fast you're going and coordinate the beat of the music...

01:08.923 --> 01:11.250
...to ensure you maintain a world record pace,...

01:11.644 --> 01:13.627
...then records may fall like raindrops.

01:14.552 --> 01:17.769
Athlete's attitude towards this is that it's almost cheating,...

01:18.203 --> 01:22.450
...and that's because that synchronous effect from music is so well understood.

01:23.436 --> 01:27.848
Soon athletes may have tiny MP3 players that can be worn under the skin.

01:28.247 --> 01:32.921
Since people are already having implants for contraception, why not for performance?
