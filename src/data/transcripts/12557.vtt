In the next decade, millions of baby boomers will hit retirement age,...

00:07.296 --> 00:09.154
...but they're too busy to talk about it...

00:09.312 --> 00:12.335
...because retirement is just not on their radar screens.

00:12.972 --> 00:16.455
People nearing retirement feel vague, emotional discomfort,...

00:16.596 --> 00:19.345
...but tend not to plan anything other than travel,...

00:19.458 --> 00:22.041
...fix-it chores, or moving to another locale...

00:22.367 --> 00:24.808
...that's called the "first phase" of retirement.

00:25.134 --> 00:29.272
It lasts about six months, and then the newly retired get antsy.

00:29.709 --> 00:32.999
The second phase is an active phase of about 20 years.

00:33.229 --> 00:35.433
That's when new retirees need to plan,...

00:35.596 --> 00:38.679
...to understand who they are, or what they want to do-...

00:38.975 --> 00:41.077
...this is a chance for a second career.

00:41.337 --> 00:45.351
But what kind of career? Many don't want to be apartment superintendents,...

00:45.584 --> 00:48.813
...but want work that uses skills developed over a lifetime.

00:49.200 --> 00:53.261
Finding a fulfilling second career often depends on the retiree.

00:53.911 --> 00:57.367
One-third of people who retire say they want to work part-time.

00:57.779 --> 01:02.325
It's key to identify what your skills, abilities, values and interests are.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.605
Once you can get a clear fix on what you want,...

01:05.894 --> 01:08.131
...you will be able to find a venue to work in.

01:08.886 --> 01:10.244
So don't fear retirement.

01:10.583 --> 01:15.516
The whole concept of retirement does not fit the lexicon of those who chase their dreams...

01:15.592 --> 01:16.629
...and do what they love.

01:17.003 --> 01:20.812
Creative and powerful people all admit they would work without pay,...

01:20.980 --> 01:23.632
...saying if you chase ideas, the money will come.

01:23.987 --> 01:26.717
But if you chase money, the ideas get lost.
