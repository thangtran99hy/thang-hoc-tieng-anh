Hello. Welcome to Michael's Better Business English.

00:03.786 --> 00:06.262
This month, we're looking at how to lead a meeting.

00:06.973 --> 00:10.686
Now of course, this can be difficult in Japanese as well as in English.

00:11.407 --> 00:14.837
There are three key things you need to do to lead a meeting successfully.

00:15.596 --> 00:18.320
First, keep the meeting on topic.

00:19.137 --> 00:22.323
Second, shorten overlong discussions.

00:22.890 --> 00:25.421
Third, resolve conflict.

00:26.309 --> 00:27.310
How can you do this?

00:27.897 --> 00:33.160
Well, for keeping the meeting on topic, it's very useful to have a written agenda.

00:33.938 --> 00:39.303
Then in the meeting, you can refer to the agenda and stop people from getting sidetracked,...

00:39.596 --> 00:40.749
...going off-topic.

00:41.504 --> 00:45.459
We often use that expression, "Let's not get sidetracked." in a meeting...

00:45.833 --> 00:47.357
...to keep the meeting on topic.

00:48.659 --> 00:51.129
Second, shorten overlong discussions.

00:51.811 --> 00:55.117
Here, it's very useful to refer to specific times,...

00:55.435 --> 00:58.457
...such as the end time of the meeting or deadline,...

00:58.824 --> 01:01.829
...to help people keep focused and avoid wasting time.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.158
Third, to resolve conflict.

01:05.708 --> 01:10.005
Here, you should stay calm, be neutral and move the discussion on.

01:10.648 --> 01:15.825
Maybe move on to a less controversial topic or a different item on the agenda,...

01:16.228 --> 01:18.475
...before going back to that original item.

01:19.753 --> 01:21.027
Or even take a break.

01:21.490 --> 01:23.779
That can let people calm down and relax.

01:24.641 --> 01:28.541
So, use these techniques to lead a meeting successfully.

01:29.321 --> 01:30.245
Thank you very much.
