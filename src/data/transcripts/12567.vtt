Have you ever been told that you look like someone famous?

00:05.476 --> 00:06.523
Of course you have!

00:07.002 --> 00:10.446
Now there is a website that uses face recognition software...

00:10.696 --> 00:14.510
...and compares your face to hundreds of celebrity faces in their database.

00:14.989 --> 00:16.201
It's easy and fun.

00:16.452 --> 00:20.771
More importantly, you can find out how true your friends flattery really was.

00:21.560 --> 00:23.822
Face recognition runs in 3 steps.

00:24.485 --> 00:27.747
One, the digital photo that you provide is loaded.

00:28.304 --> 00:34.173
Two, face detection technology is applied to automatically detect human faces in your photo.

00:34.937 --> 00:39.037
Three, face recognition technology is applied to recognize...

00:39.151 --> 00:41.405
...the faces detected in the previous step.

00:42.245 --> 00:44.751
Algorithms compare the faces in your photo...

00:45.057 --> 00:48.649
...with all faces previously known to the face recognition database...

00:49.129 --> 00:52.992
...and then they are matched with the celebrities' with your bone and facial patterns.

00:53.772 --> 00:57.758
The more photos are added to the system, the more powerful it becomes.

00:58.441 --> 01:01.031
If people in your photos are not recognized well,...

01:01.411 --> 01:04.753
...it is likely that the database has never encountered them before.

01:05.507 --> 01:10.287
By adding your photos to this database and annotating the people in the photo manually,...

01:10.701 --> 01:13.311
...the database operators will "learn" these faces...

01:13.793 --> 01:16.549
...and will be able to recognize them in future photos,...

01:16.956 --> 01:19.375
...even in different ages of the same person's life.

01:20.365 --> 01:24.545
The algorithms used by database operators face recognition software...

01:24.827 --> 01:27.794
...are even likely to find relatives of people in your photo,...

01:28.179 --> 01:32.545
...due to the genetic - based facial similarities that exist between relatives.

01:33.072 --> 01:39.083
You might even be able to use this to form connections between people whom you never even knew were related.
