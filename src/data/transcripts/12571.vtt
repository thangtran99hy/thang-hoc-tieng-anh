Food does define people and it has defined Chinese people in Britain.

00:35.293 --> 00:45.141
And I think I feel for the British people because I think you've had that same definition:...

00:45.837 --> 00:49.774
...British people, British food; not so good...

00:50.742 --> 00:55.148
...you know, so I think times have changed very much so.

00:59.173 --> 01:05.881
My father was very entrepreneurial and he moved our family from Taiwan to South Africa when I was five.

01:06.402 --> 01:10.656
And then when I was about ten in December 1988,...

01:11.101 --> 01:13.183
...he moved us here to England.

01:13.569 --> 01:16.299
It was a big shock to the system.

01:17.782 --> 01:23.370
Coming from very sunny, open spaced South Africa...

01:23.476 --> 01:30.462
...to London which was at that time not the best time to come in December: dull, miserable, grey.

01:34.261 --> 01:41.421
The food that I had; my first experience at school was having jacket potatoes, fish and chips,...

01:42.535 --> 01:48.887
...pies and a lot of it was fine for the first week.

01:49.368 --> 01:53.161
But week after week after week, it was the same set of food...

01:53.234 --> 01:56.118
...so for me, it was very, very bland and very boring.

01:56.709 --> 02:01.974
So I was coming back from university one day,...

02:02.297 --> 02:05.995
...and I was really hungry and I stopped off at the usual suspects.

02:06.243 --> 02:15.309
And I saw an array of oriental packets like salads and dishes and I thought, "Oh, this is new."

02:15.679 --> 02:17.387
"This is something very interesting and different."

02:17.463 --> 02:20.845
So they're obviously trying to up their game...

02:21.039 --> 02:25.157
...and I took my first bite and I was so disappointed.

02:25.237 --> 02:29.971
It was the most boring, bland noodle salad I'd ever tasted.

02:30.044 --> 02:32.423
And I thought to myself, "I could do better than this."

02:33.265 --> 02:36.131
And that was when it gave me an idea to start my own business.
