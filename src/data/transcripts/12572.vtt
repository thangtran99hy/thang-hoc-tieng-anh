The Education Ministry wants to test a teacher evaluation system for K-12 schools...

00:08.835 --> 00:11.350
...and then fully implement it in 2007.

00:11.903 --> 00:15.304
The major teaching unions and associations are largely opposed,...

00:15.648 --> 00:17.955
...so whether inspections are dead on arrival...

00:18.115 --> 00:21.618
...or will be able to perform their intended function no one knows.

00:22.113 --> 00:25.734
Voluntary teacher participation makes the process murkier still...

00:26.118 --> 00:29.698
...because of the prospect of either subversion or resistance to it.

00:30.356 --> 00:34.523
In principle, teacher appraisal by fellow teachers, parents and students,...

00:34.764 --> 00:37.036
...contributes to classroom democratization.

00:37.569 --> 00:40.242
In addition, healthy competition between teachers...

00:40.587 --> 00:43.633
...can be of great help in improving the quality of education,...

00:43.939 --> 00:47.349
...so teacher evaluation should not be opposed unconditionally.

00:48.186 --> 00:51.471
However, the union feels that reality is far more complex.

00:51.952 --> 00:55.075
They insist that the new system should have a format that contributes...

00:55.308 --> 00:57.123
...to the increase in education quality...

00:57.461 --> 01:01.249
...by solving current problems with materials and teaching technique only.

01:02.075 --> 01:04.589
Those who oppose the union's point of view feel that...

01:04.705 --> 01:07.656
...this approach will still allow bad teachers to persist.

01:08.210 --> 01:11.837
Moreover, bad instructors will teach for show at inspection time...

01:12.217 --> 01:15.702
...and not use the information to improve themselves or their teaching.

01:16.240 --> 01:20.298
Furthermore, they feel without accountability the inspection will be worthless.
