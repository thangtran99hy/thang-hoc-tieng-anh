00:05.737 --> 00:06.225
It's hot.

00:06.819 --> 00:07.463
You're hungry.

00:07.948 --> 00:09.343
You've got nothing better to do.

00:10.036 --> 00:11.623
Why not fry an egg on the sidewalk?

00:12.210 --> 00:20.302
You will need: eggs, aluminum foil, a mirror or magnifying glass, and a very, very hot sidewalk.

00:20.773 --> 00:23.948
Optional: Butter or oil, and salt and pepper.

00:24.664 --> 00:31.559
Step 1: The temperature of the sidewalk needs to reach at least 158 degrees Fahrenheit to turn a raw egg solid.

00:32.027 --> 00:35.314
Sorry, a light - colored sidewalk on its own won't do the trick.

00:35.571 --> 00:37.017
You'll need to cheat just a little.

00:37.473 --> 00:43.809
Step 2: The easiest and most sanitary way to fry an egg on the sidewalk is to use a piece of aluminum foil.

00:44.181 --> 00:46.805
Take a pan - size piece of foil and bend the edges up,...

00:46.939 --> 00:49.058
...so the raw egg doesn't slide onto the pavement.

00:49.535 --> 00:52.288
Step 3: Crack an egg or two onto the foil.

00:52.665 --> 00:55.175
The sun will reflect off the surface and cook your eggs.

00:55.568 --> 00:57.257
If you intend to eat these eggs,...

00:57.486 --> 01:01.085
...you might wanna use some butter or oil on the tin foil so it doesn't stick.

01:01.490 --> 01:03.491
And season your eggs with some salt and pepper.

01:03.942 --> 01:06.343
Step 4: To speed up the process,...

01:06.467 --> 01:09.907
...use a magnifying glass or mirror to focus the sun rays on the foil.

01:10.309 --> 01:11.232
Now you're cooking!

01:11.849 --> 01:14.441
Step 5: After your egg is cooked,...

01:14.596 --> 01:18.584
...tell everyone that it was so hot outside that you were able to fry an egg on the sidewalk.

01:18.977 --> 01:23.083
They'll either think you are most egg-zelent or just egg-zagerating.

01:23.589 --> 01:28.751
Did you know? Every 4th of July, Oatman, Arizona has a solar egg - frying contest.
