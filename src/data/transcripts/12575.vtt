00:03.529 --> 00:05.914
If scientists could create a pill that let you live...

00:06.021 --> 00:09.680
...twice as long while remaining free of infirmities, would you take it?

00:10.771 --> 00:14.537
If one considers only the personal benefits that longer life would bring,...

00:14.901 --> 00:16.697
...the answer might seem like a no-brainer:

00:17.385 --> 00:20.056
People could spend more quality time with loved ones;

00:20.360 --> 00:22.361
watch future generations grow up;

00:22.695 --> 00:23.944
learn new languages;

00:24.264 --> 00:26.117
master new musical instruments;

00:26.453 --> 00:28.691
try different careers or travel the world.

00:29.354 --> 00:31.319
But what about society as a whole?

00:31.862 --> 00:34.205
Would it be better off if lifespans were doubled?

00:35.181 --> 00:38.818
A doubled lifespan gives us a chance to recover from our mistakes,...

00:39.395 --> 00:41.558
...leads us towards longer - term thinking...

00:41.892 --> 00:46.238
...and reduces health care costs by delaying the onset of expensive diseases of aging.

00:46.936 --> 00:50.441
It also raises productivity by adding to our prime years.

00:51.391 --> 00:55.725
Conversely, doubling lifespans won't solve our current social problems.

00:56.350 --> 01:00.675
War, poverty, etc. may not be helped by having people live longer.

01:01.240 --> 01:04.508
We must ask, "What will we get as a society?"

01:05.489 --> 01:10.100
Others point out that a doubling of the human lifespan will affect society at every level.

01:10.667 --> 01:15.403
Notions about marriage, family and work, will change in fundamental ways they say,...

01:15.759 --> 01:18.520
...as will attitudes toward the young and the old...

01:19.311 --> 01:23.682
While opinions differ wildly about what the ramifications for society will be...

01:24.055 --> 01:26.079
...if the human lifespan is extended,...

01:26.588 --> 01:29.643
...most ethicists agree that the issue should be discussed now,...

01:30.148 --> 01:33.476
...since it might be impossible to stop or control the technology...

01:33.674 --> 01:34.851
...once it's developed.
