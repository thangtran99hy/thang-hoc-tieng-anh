A "time capsule" is a container used to store for posterity a selection of objects...

00:07.984 --> 00:11.073
...thought to be representative of life at a particular time.

00:11.861 --> 00:14.494
Time capsules are interesting to people of all ages...

00:14.784 --> 00:16.631
...and touch people on a worldwide scale.

00:17.338 --> 00:18.919
Properly prepared time capsules...

00:19.249 --> 00:21.747
...preserve the unique and relevant features of history...

00:22.061 --> 00:25.427
...and can serve as valuable reminders of one generation for another.

00:26.139 --> 00:27.843
Time capsules give individuals,...

00:27.946 --> 00:31.197
...families and organizations an independent voice to the future.

00:32.189 --> 00:33.637
Time Capsule Making Tips.

00:34.461 --> 00:40.065
One. Select a retrieval date. Centennial (100 - year) time capsules are popular.

00:40.674 --> 00:45.198
Two. Choose an "archivist" and make committees to share the work load.

00:46.025 --> 00:47.760
Three. Select a container.

00:48.151 --> 00:51.155
Safes are excellent because they're cool, dry, and dark.

00:51.886 --> 00:55.284
Four. Find a secure indoor location. Don't bury it!

00:55.847 --> 00:59.321
Mark the location with a plaque describing the time capsule's "mission".

01:00.121 --> 01:03.371
Five. Select items that will have meaning into the future...

01:03.638 --> 01:05.022
...from the sublime to the trivial.

01:05.501 --> 01:07.066
Don't forget to make an inventory.

01:07.779 --> 01:10.246
Six. Have a solemn "sealing ceremony"...

01:10.619 --> 01:13.113
...and formally christen the time capsule with a name.

01:13.804 --> 01:16.580
Invite the media and make a good photographic record...

01:16.911 --> 01:18.915
...including the inside of your time capsule.

01:19.700 --> 01:22.011
Seven. Don't forget your time capsule!

01:22.447 --> 01:25.630
Renew the tradition of memory with anniversaries and reunions.

01:26.104 --> 01:29.558
Send out invitations to the projected opening. Be creative.

01:30.380 --> 01:33.467
Eight. Inform the International Time Capsule Society.

01:33.916 --> 01:37.289
The ITCS will add your time capsule to its database...

01:37.601 --> 01:40.329
...in an attempt to register all known time capsules.
