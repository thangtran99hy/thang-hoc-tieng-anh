Hello. Welcome to Michael's Better Business English.

00:04.284 --> 00:09.761
This month, we're looking at a very important technique: how to be positive.

00:10.762 --> 00:13.116
Here, there are two key issues to be careful of.

00:13.716 --> 00:15.500
First: Attitude.

00:16.243 --> 00:20.109
Do you have a can't-do attitude or can-do attitude?

00:21.274 --> 00:25.006
Often, Japanese business people tend to focus on problems,...

00:25.083 --> 00:27.486
...difficulties or risks in meetings.

00:28.048 --> 00:31.113
This can have a bit of a negative impression on other people.

00:31.935 --> 00:36.467
Other cultures such as Western cultures prefer a can-do approach.

00:36.946 --> 00:42.892
Rather than focusing on problems or risks, what are the solutions or opportunities?

00:44.728 --> 00:50.189
Secondly, use positive language to be positive and show a can-do attitude.

00:51.185 --> 00:56.815
Try using not, plus a positive word instead of a negative word.

00:57.472 --> 01:00.969
For example: "This quarter, sales were bad."

01:01.854 --> 01:05.824
Better: "This quarter, sales were not so good."

01:06.559 --> 01:10.247
Still the same basic meaning but a more positive feeling.

01:12.332 --> 01:16.329
Also, try balancing a negative point with a positive one.

01:17.027 --> 01:20.565
For example: "Sales last year were not so good"...

01:21.162 --> 01:23.853
..."but this year, they're looking much better."

01:25.590 --> 01:29.780
And finally, try to use more positive words in your speech.

01:30.393 --> 01:36.777
Words like successful, excellent, wonderful, great or exciting.

01:37.499 --> 01:41.439
This will help give a positive impression to the mind of the listener.

01:42.705 --> 01:46.767
So, use these techniques and you can be positive too.

01:47.619 --> 01:49.061
Thank you and good luck.
