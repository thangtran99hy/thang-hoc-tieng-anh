Neuroscientist Read Montague...

00:04.778 --> 00:09.367
...was wondering why people preferred the taste of Pepsi but Coke controlled the market.

00:09.963 --> 00:14.179
Montague wanted to know why people would buy a product they didn't particularly like.

00:14.842 --> 00:18.769
His data founded an entirely new field: neuromarketing,...

00:19.103 --> 00:22.049
...the study of the brain's responses to ads and brands.

00:23.158 --> 00:27.032
Montague looked at consumer's neural activity with an MRI machine.

00:27.413 --> 00:28.757
Using blind tasting,...

00:29.055 --> 00:32.911
...subjects were given both drinks with almost half saying they preferred Pepsi.

00:33.413 --> 00:35.199
Told later which sample was Coke,...

00:35.575 --> 00:37.639
...three-fourths said that Coke tasted better,...

00:37.961 --> 00:39.797
...and their brain activity changed, too.

00:40.479 --> 00:43.505
Coke lit up the part of the brain that controls higher thinking.

00:44.051 --> 00:48.491
Montague believed that the brain was recalling images and ideas from commercials,...

00:48.845 --> 00:52.225
...and the brand was overriding the actual quality of the product.

00:53.191 --> 00:57.577
For years, in the face of failed brands and laughably bad ad campaigns,...

00:57.958 --> 01:01.279
...marketers had argued that they could influence consumer's choices.

01:01.832 --> 01:05.073
Now, there appeared to be solid neurological proof.

01:05.675 --> 01:08.259
Daimler - Chrysler's research has recently found...

01:08.581 --> 01:11.849
...that sportier car models activate the brain's reward centers,...

01:12.372 --> 01:15.699
...the same areas that light up in response to alcohol and drugs.

01:16.681 --> 01:20.136
Marketers know that some brands have a seemingly magical appeal...

01:20.630 --> 01:23.867
...with buyers saying the brand is an extension of their personalities.

01:24.233 --> 01:28.859
Neuromarketing research is expected to soon show exactly which products those are.

01:29.755 --> 01:34.181
But some worry that it could eventually lead to complete corporate manipulation of consumers...

01:34.300 --> 01:39.313
...or citizens, with governments using brain scans to create more effective propaganda.
