Many people say yes to doing more than they have time to do.

00:06.675 --> 00:10.479
Then when it is time to do what's promised, they discover they're too busy.

00:11.029 --> 00:14.774
The trouble is almost everyone makes some faulty assumptions about the future.

00:15.459 --> 00:16.551
According to researchers,...

00:16.871 --> 00:21.476
...people over - commit because they expect to have more time in the future than in the present.

00:21.985 --> 00:26.480
When tomorrow becomes today, yesterday's "yes" becomes today's "Oh no!"

00:27.471 --> 00:32.357
Interestingly, researchers found people mistakenly expect a future surplus of time...

00:32.744 --> 00:35.409
...more often than they expect a future surplus of money.

00:36.219 --> 00:40.668
People just seem to be much more accurate in forecasting their need for money than time.

00:41.530 --> 00:43.089
Because every day is a little different,...

00:43.450 --> 00:47.078
...the nature of time fools us and we "forget" about how we use it.

00:47.696 --> 00:51.457
Money, can be changed easily - such as four quarters for a dollar bill.

00:52.068 --> 00:55.971
Our employment or family status and our supply of and demand for money...

00:56.291 --> 00:58.045
...are relatively constant over time.

00:58.444 --> 01:00.658
So compared with demands for one's time,...

01:01.025 --> 01:04.748
...future money needs are relatively predictable from money needs today.

01:05.755 --> 01:07.895
People often make commitments long in advance...

01:08.247 --> 01:11.683
...that they would never make if the same commitments required immediate action.

01:12.101 --> 01:14.830
Why? Because the future always looks ideal:

01:15.277 --> 01:18.764
The fridge is stocked, the weather is clear, the train runs on schedule...

01:19.021 --> 01:20.201
...and meetings end on time.

01:20.775 --> 01:24.185
But today - all kinds of problems can and probably will happen...

01:24.556 --> 01:26.829
...and our perfect schedule goes up in smoke.
