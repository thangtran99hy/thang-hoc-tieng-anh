00:02.688 --> 00:05.987
Many Korean firms have moved their factories to China...

00:06.117 --> 00:08.967
...expecting to receive a large labor cost-savings.

00:09.460 --> 00:14.720
And some of those same Korean firms wish to achieve similar cost-savings with their factories here...

00:14.839 --> 00:16.372
...by bringing workers from China.

00:17.543 --> 00:19.741
Chinese workers believe if they go to Korea,...

00:20.136 --> 00:22.886
...they'll earn about 10 times more than in China.

00:23.441 --> 00:26.593
They also think it is best to be recruited by their own company...

00:26.983 --> 00:30.391
...because it costs less than other ways of coming to Korea to work.

00:31.329 --> 00:34.325
However, there is one big problem with this scenario.

00:34.895 --> 00:38.331
After arriving, they are naturally quite angry upon finding out that...

00:38.442 --> 00:40.455
...Korea has different pay scales for:

00:41.044 --> 00:44.078
One, undocumented (illegal) workers

00:44.529 --> 00:47.824
Two, migrant workers registered as trainees...

00:47.953 --> 00:50.981
...by the Korea Federation of Small and Medium Businesses

00:51.801 --> 00:55.394
Three, trainees from overseas invested companies.

00:56.437 --> 01:00.191
Workers in the last group were in the worst situation. Why?

01:00.761 --> 01:03.574
Workers who are paid by the original factory abroad...

01:03.883 --> 01:06.489
...can be paid the same wage as the workers in China.

01:07.222 --> 01:12.349
This allows Korean companies to use a legal loophole to truly exploit migrant labor.

01:13.257 --> 01:17.410
Some Korean factories employ Korean workers, normal migrant workers,...

01:17.615 --> 01:20.478
...and migrant workers transferred from overseas factories...

01:20.980 --> 01:22.433
...who perform the same job,..

01:22.739 --> 01:26.970
...work the same hours under the same roof all on different pay scales.
