When Sally was six years old, she contracted a virus that destroyed her heart muscle,...

00:07.753 --> 00:09.855
...rendering her heart virtually useless,...

00:10.078 --> 00:13.524
...and triggering with terrifying speed, multiple organ failure.

00:14.276 --> 00:18.784
She was saved by the recent invention of an artificial heart when her own was failing...

00:19.189 --> 00:22.417
...and the donation of a heart from the family of a 48 - year old woman...

00:22.739 --> 00:26.306
...who had lost her life just as Sally was clinging desperately to hers.

00:27.248 --> 00:30.949
"I know I am very lucky to be alive," says Sally quietly.

00:31.560 --> 00:34.326
"I am so grateful to the family of the woman who died.

00:35.005 --> 00:39.409
I think that agreeing to allow the heart of their loved one to be donated was so kind,...

00:39.899 --> 00:41.526
...and I think about her often."

00:42.637 --> 00:47.367
Now 13, she runs around with a heart that is now 55 years old.

00:48.029 --> 00:49.889
Occasionally she gets out of breath,...

00:50.234 --> 00:52.815
...and in winter her hands and feet become painful...

00:53.076 --> 00:56.848
...which are typical symptoms of someone who has had a heart transplant.

00:57.923 --> 01:02.671
Sally's transplanted heart has already been in her body for nearly seven years,...

01:03.119 --> 01:06.055
...and although she takes anti - rejection drugs every day,...

01:06.432 --> 01:11.696
...her immune system is slowly but surely destroying what it sees as an enemy invasion of her body.

01:12.293 --> 01:17.896
Because of this process, the average life expectancy of a donor heart is around 12 to 13 years,...

01:18.384 --> 01:23.184
...so it is likely that before she reaches 20, Sally may need another heart.

01:23.658 --> 01:26.515
But that's something her family prefers not to dwell on.
