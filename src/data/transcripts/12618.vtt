00:03.383 --> 00:08.539
For years, Goldfish, a tasty subsidiary of the Carp Group, was a quiet company.

00:08.929 --> 00:12.979
Goldfish's shares barely traded on the stock exchange and had no website.

00:13.599 --> 00:16.385
Carp's chairman, Mr. Whale, never spoke to the media.

00:17.364 --> 00:22.204
Their quiet blue sea ran red when a barracuda invaded the annual shareholder's meeting.

00:22.971 --> 00:26.454
These insurgent shareholders, had the media in a feeding frenzy,...

00:26.754 --> 00:31.119
...and were intent on scaring the company into transparency and higher stock prices.

00:31.968 --> 00:35.691
Suddenly, Goldfish executives had to answer uncomfortable questions.

00:36.122 --> 00:41.067
Why was a Fish company investing so much money in the unrelated fields of moon exploration...

00:41.345 --> 00:43.694
...and desert mining units of the parent firm?

00:44.410 --> 00:47.611
Had the details of these fishy transactions been fully declared?

00:48.055 --> 00:52.631
Were these investments to benefit Goldfish shareholders - or the Whale family empire?

00:53.037 --> 00:55.915
If Goldfish's grilling sounds familiar, it should.

00:56.339 --> 00:59.794
The Korea Corporate Governance Fund, is a domestic barracuda,...

01:00.087 --> 01:03.555
...who is emulating other corporate activists like Carl Icahn...

01:03.879 --> 01:06.305
...and the Dubai - based Sovereign Asset Management...

01:07.085 --> 01:11.443
...-foreign investors who ripped their way into some of South Korea's meatiest corporate icons...

01:11.765 --> 01:14.309
...by demanding greater accountability to shareholders,...

01:14.653 --> 01:19.559
...but ultimately conducting what many saw as unfair greenmail raids on the companies.

01:20.703 --> 01:26.168
The appearance of KCGF means that fat tasty companies will now have to swim fast...

01:26.281 --> 01:29.121
...to fend off not only corporate raiders from outside...

01:29.457 --> 01:32.929
...but also from inside South Korea by improving their management.

01:33.419 --> 01:37.061
And this will be positive for both stock market shrimps and whales.
