00:03.027 --> 00:04.651
What Makes You Unique?

00:05.426 --> 00:09.562
Just as no two snowflakes are alike, you are like no one else.

00:09.955 --> 00:13.094
There has been only one Beethoven, one Michelangelo,...

00:13.323 --> 00:17.935
...one Churchill, one Da Vinci, one Gandhi - and only one you.

00:18.896 --> 00:21.024
How many people can do what you can do?

00:21.679 --> 00:24.111
Among 10,000 unique human skills,...

00:24.513 --> 00:28.297
...everyone has at least 5 to 10 uncommon skills they excel at.

00:28.890 --> 00:32.919
If you can sing, calculate the odds, track bird migrations,...

00:33.213 --> 00:36.661
...or know which direction is north better than 100 random people,..

00:37.259 --> 00:40.519
...your gift puts you in the top 1% of the population.

00:41.419 --> 00:45.461
When you start calculating the odds as you add in more of your gifts and talents...

00:45.986 --> 00:51.139
...-having just five skills means you are one in ten billion likely to have that combination:

00:52.016 --> 01:07.729
Rarity equals (5 at 1/100) equals 1/100 times 1/100 times 1/100 times 1/100 times 1/100 equals 1/10 billion.

01:08.697 --> 01:11.589
That is more people than are alive on the Earth today.

01:12.549 --> 01:15.353
The paradox is that you are both truly unique...

01:15.643 --> 01:18.383
...and one of a countless multitude at the same time.

01:19.194 --> 01:23.123
With uniqueness comes responsibility as only you have the gifts,...

01:23.253 --> 01:26.487
...talents and potential to excel at the unique tasks...

01:26.807 --> 01:29.379
...which define your destiny and your life calling.

01:30.155 --> 01:33.505
If you do not fulfill your life calling, it will go undone,...

01:33.857 --> 01:36.522
...or be done by someone else in a very different way.

01:37.350 --> 01:41.440
Often, the victor in the human race is the person who makes the race their own.
