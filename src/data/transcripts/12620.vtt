Politics affects everyone and the best way for citizens to affect politics is by voting.

00:08.757 --> 00:12.409
Although it is easier to criticize our politicians than to praise them,...

00:12.731 --> 00:14.799
...it's important to remember we elected them.

00:15.237 --> 00:20.691
Ideally, we elect people who will faithfully represent us at both the local and national level...

00:20.957 --> 00:23.392
...and we have only ourselves to blame if they don't.

00:24.320 --> 00:27.766
Some of the issues that affect citizens and their decision to vote...

00:27.886 --> 00:30.479
...for certain candidates are based on local issues.

00:31.102 --> 00:33.086
People may want more parks nearby.

00:33.463 --> 00:37.043
People living in cities may want more or less development in their neighborhood.

00:37.605 --> 00:41.334
Others want improvement in air quality or less industry in their area.

00:42.141 --> 00:47.023
Finally, some citizens may want improved city services and a more responsive government.

00:47.985 --> 00:51.762
At the national level, citizens may want a stronger national defense...

00:52.049 --> 00:54.873
...or more international prestige and power for Korea.

00:55.523 --> 00:59.479
Citizens and other groups may want to see improvement in the education system.

01:00.018 --> 01:05.299
Laborers and unions may want the minimum wage to rise or see other types of labor reform.

01:06.063 --> 01:09.617
Businesses and the wealthy may want their taxes reduced.

01:10.029 --> 01:13.369
In short, every citizen or citizen group wants something.

01:14.413 --> 01:18.153
To get what we want, it's up to us to elect those who will work for us...

01:18.402 --> 01:20.637
...and to vote out of office those who don't.

01:21.199 --> 01:24.242
It is often said that citizens get the government they deserve.

01:24.800 --> 01:25.966
Don't we deserve better?
