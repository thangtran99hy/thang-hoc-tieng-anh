Throughout history, color has always been associated with the emotions found in humans.

00:08.078 --> 00:11.767
In the West, people are green with envy, feel blue,...

00:12.012 --> 00:14.369
...or view the world through rose - colored glasses;

00:14.963 --> 00:18.043
others are purple with fury, or tickled pink.

00:18.827 --> 00:22.521
In both east and west, to be "in the pink" means to be healthy.

00:23.218 --> 00:26.525
One of the most fascinating aspects to color researchers...

00:26.848 --> 00:30.925
...was the difference in color perception among people in various parts of the world.

00:31.681 --> 00:34.784
Red apples, yellow bananas and blue sky...

00:35.199 --> 00:38.655
...or natural human memory color's meanings remain unchanged.

00:39.062 --> 00:42.217
All other colors; however, may be interpreted differently.

00:43.232 --> 00:45.853
With skin tones, the meaning of color changes.

00:46.487 --> 00:50.343
When Asians, Europeans, and Americans are asked what skin should look like...

00:50.658 --> 00:52.783
...the answer was the same- "healthy".

00:53.333 --> 00:57.301
However, how people define "healthy" changes between cultures.

00:57.957 --> 01:00.919
In America and Europe, a tan makes you look healthy.

01:01.418 --> 01:06.477
But when someone in Asia was asked about "American tan" as a color the answer was,...

01:06.751 --> 01:08.666
..."Well, that person looks drunk."

01:09.314 --> 01:13.900
In Asia, beauty images are always very white - skinned, and very pale.

01:14.451 --> 01:18.441
Today, however, these color standards are starting to merge together...

01:18.763 --> 01:22.540
...due to global media and the standardization of beauty around the world.

01:23.443 --> 01:26.220
How does the printer get skin color mostly right?

01:26.785 --> 01:28.685
Remember when you first bought your computer,...

01:28.965 --> 01:31.831
...and it prompted you for your country of residence and language?

01:32.320 --> 01:35.628
Your printer uses your answers to determine your color preferences...

01:35.974 --> 01:38.708
...so that everyone's skin color looks "healthy".
