00:02.428 --> 00:05.732
Recognizing cabin fever is the best way to deal with it.

00:06.158 --> 00:10.487
The symptoms are well-known: boredom, edginess, irritability, restlessness,...

00:10.784 --> 00:14.082
...and dissatisfaction with being at home or stuck in an office.

00:14.753 --> 00:19.309
Maybe you're even claustrophobic or immobilized by a pervasive feeling of inertia.

00:20.218 --> 00:24.025
Besides the four walls you have to continually stare at during the winter months,...

00:24.447 --> 00:28.392
...the weather equally plays a big role in helping people acquire cabin fever.

00:28.955 --> 00:29.938
The lack of sunlight...

00:30.092 --> 00:35.708
...and increase in cloudy days during the cold winter months gives some many months of hostile despair.

00:36.429 --> 00:39.559
It can strike anytime and it's often relationship - based,...

00:39.815 --> 00:43.414
...especially when someone cares for children or the infirm at home.

00:44.189 --> 00:47.079
Having a moody housemate is another way of getting cabin fever.

00:47.593 --> 00:49.664
Not only do you have to deal with it in yourself,...

00:49.975 --> 00:52.263
...but also face it when interacting with others.

00:53.301 --> 00:56.997
Fighting cabin fever is also sometimes an actual source of trouble.

00:57.618 --> 00:59.305
Try to know the sufferer's character.

00:59.723 --> 01:04.609
If possible, give the sufferer a wide berth to ease his or her sense of confinement.

01:05.081 --> 01:08.815
For some, following a routine and keeping busy can give solace.

01:09.211 --> 01:11.975
For others, it may make the sufferer feel worse.

01:12.854 --> 01:15.541
A temporary change of scenery, calling a friend, or...

01:15.663 --> 01:18.089
...taking a break from routine may also help.

01:18.597 --> 01:20.516
Remember the problem may not be yours...

01:20.837 --> 01:24.296
...but by recognizing it in the person in the next cubicle at work...

01:24.625 --> 01:27.359
...or in someone you live with you can adjust for it.
