Where in the States, most support for the arts comes through private donors,...

00:07.134 --> 00:08.999
...through charities and through corporate sponsorship.

00:09.561 --> 00:15.948
And here, you have something quite unique in the UK which is the public funding of the Arts and there's public subsidy.

00:18.271 --> 00:21.249
The National is subsidized by the UK taxpayer.

00:21.851 --> 00:25.696
And what that allows it to do is to keep ticket prices very low and accessible,...

00:25.783 --> 00:31.222
...so people can still come to the theater and see some of the greatest actors in the UK for ten pounds.

00:31.814 --> 00:33.751
You just couldn't pay that on Broadway, it wouldn't exist.

00:34.737 --> 00:40.299
So, it allows the National to do incredibly risky work but at a level of quality, of professionalism,...

00:40.957 --> 00:42.314
...which you wouldn't see anywhere else.

00:44.229 --> 00:47.993
Today is the second camera rehearsal for our broadcast of Nation.

00:49.543 --> 00:55.079
Nation is a really dynamic show and one that we're really excited to do because it's our first live matinee.

00:55.901 --> 00:59.357
And it's the first time that we construct to engage a children's audience, a family audience.

01:01.803 --> 01:05.061
The amazing thing about having such strong public support for the arts...

01:05.345 --> 01:10.581
...is that it sends out a message to audiences, to people, that the arts are important.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.917
The US doesn't have a national theater.

01:13.260 --> 01:19.761
So, there are lots of places, I would argue, in America where it doesn't reach all the people.

01:20.588 --> 01:24.666
And the fact that the UK has this building which sits right in the heart of London,...

01:24.885 --> 01:27.201
...on the South Bank where millions of people are walking by,...

01:27.850 --> 01:30.117
...there's a real sense of this theater being a hub.

01:30.729 --> 01:34.393
And I think it stands as a kind of symbol to what the arts means in this country.

01:34.875 --> 01:37.980
That the arts is for everyone, supported by all the people.

01:38.573 --> 01:43.190
And that it is an incredibly important activity which enriches the life of everyone in this country.
