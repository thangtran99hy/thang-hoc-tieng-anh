00:00.839 --> 00:03.009
Please, we're living in a country, in England.

00:04.629 --> 00:06.441
We're praying five times, there's mosques.

00:06.747 --> 00:08.548
You know, the freedom is there, everything is there.

00:09.322 --> 00:12.549
Whatever happens or is going on in the world, we don't have to explain...

00:12.857 --> 00:18.532
...but we can do what we can do, and what we can do is we can win people with our attitude.

00:20.108 --> 00:23.518
Nobody is disrespecting each other's culture here or religion here.

00:24.357 --> 00:28.525
The most important thing in Britain is people let you do what you want to do.

00:29.210 --> 00:30.145
And that's important.

00:32.454 --> 00:34.889
English people are very open-hearted,...

00:35.927 --> 00:38.972
...you know, they can accept your thing.

00:39.101 --> 00:42.393
You know, I remember while I was playing professional cricket for Somerset,...

00:42.783 --> 00:47.313
...my teammates used to tell me, "Is it your prayer time? Should we stop on some motorway services?"

00:47.685 --> 00:49.399
"So, we can have a coffee, you can have your prayer."

00:49.925 --> 00:54.387
So, you know, if you have that kind of people around you and that culture,...

00:54.661 --> 00:56.236
...I don't think people will have any problem.

01:01.859 --> 01:06.455
I was approached by England to become a spin bowling coach...

01:06.912 --> 01:07.863
...and I said, "Why not?"

01:09.165 --> 01:14.157
When Pakistan play in England, my feeling is that Pakistan obviously is my country...

01:14.597 --> 01:19.575
...but my job allows me to be loyal with England and be honest with England.

01:22.493 --> 01:29.891
There's plenty of fans, like Pakistani people, who actually lives in England but they support Pakistani cricketers.

01:31.069 --> 01:34.155
You can support Pakistan, you know, when they're playing against England.

01:34.249 --> 01:34.929
That's fair enough.

01:35.370 --> 01:36.043
That's sport.

01:37.452 --> 01:41.443
But please remember, you're living in a country where they provide you everything,...

01:41.785 --> 01:42.969
...so you've got to be honest with them.

01:44.656 --> 01:47.692
You're living in Britain so you've got to look after Britain.

01:49.063 --> 01:55.411
If I didn't have this information of Islam, then maybe I would have a doubtful thinking.

01:56.101 --> 01:59.279
But at the moment, I'm very clear and I have no doubt.
