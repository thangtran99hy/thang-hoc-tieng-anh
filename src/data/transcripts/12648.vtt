00:02.744 --> 00:04.601
So, what do I know about change?

00:05.786 --> 00:09.150
First thing I know is that everybody is afraid of something.

00:10.148 --> 00:13.113
Everybody is afraid of something.

00:13.905 --> 00:16.428
All of you are afraid of something.

00:16.643 --> 00:18.045
All of us are afraid of something.

00:18.346 --> 00:22.861
What distinguishes people who are successful in their life from those who are not...

00:23.272 --> 00:24.725
...is what you do with your fear.

00:26.024 --> 00:28.458
Some people are held back by their fears...

00:28.523 --> 00:31.289
...and some people choose to move ahead in spite of fear.

00:31.628 --> 00:33.827
Courage is not the absence of fear.

00:33.957 --> 00:36.029
Courage is acting in spite of fear.

00:36.977 --> 00:43.279
But because everybody is afraid, what most of the time people are afraid of is something new.

00:45.105 --> 00:47.947
The essence of entrepreneurship is risk taking.

00:49.057 --> 00:51.571
The essence of business is risk taking.

00:52.069 --> 00:55.713
Taking a risk is all about trying something new.

00:56.855 --> 01:01.597
And yet as people go on in their lives, they become afraid of trying something new.

01:02.752 --> 01:06.557
And so, change is always resisted, always.

01:07.511 --> 01:12.854
Because people are afraid, even if what they have is not satisfying to them,...

01:12.943 --> 01:16.699
...a lot of people are afraid to venture into the unknown.

01:17.267 --> 01:19.380
And that holds them back from change.

01:20.229 --> 01:25.182
And if you are trying to drive a company, an organization, your colleagues towards change,...

01:25.251 --> 01:28.098
...you have to know that they are afraid.

01:28.961 --> 01:35.278
And you have to know as well that the only way you can help people get over their fear...

01:36.024 --> 01:41.619
...is to give them a vision of something that's worth striving for,...

01:42.096 --> 01:44.702
...that's worth taking a risk for.

01:45.657 --> 01:50.875
But the other reason change is always resisted is because the natural momentum,...

01:50.989 --> 01:54.005
...the natural instinct of any institution...

01:55.039 --> 01:55.991
...any institution,...

01:56.402 --> 02:01.666
...I don't care if that institution is a family, a board, a university,...

02:02.255 --> 02:05.187
...a company of five people or 500,000.

02:07.229 --> 02:10.067
Today, one of the many very interesting things that I do...

02:10.167 --> 02:13.917
...is I chair the advisory board for the Central Intelligence Agency.

02:15.122 --> 02:18.233
And so I can say, without fear of contradiction,...

02:18.626 --> 02:21.495
...that this is true of government agencies, everybody.

02:22.237 --> 02:26.598
The natural momentum of any organization is to preserve the status quo.

02:27.655 --> 02:28.136
Why?

02:29.181 --> 02:32.775
Because people who have positions of power and influence want to keep them.

02:34.379 --> 02:39.445
And so, they invest their energies in maintaining their position of power and influence.

02:39.710 --> 02:41.661
This isn't because people are bad.

02:42.695 --> 02:44.084
It's just human nature.

02:45.049 --> 02:49.599
And so again, if you are focused on risk taking, change,...

02:49.839 --> 02:54.559
...you have to understand that the momentum that works against you...

02:54.896 --> 02:56.309
..is the power of the status quo.

02:56.488 --> 02:57.319
And it's always there.

02:57.544 --> 02:58.571
That's why change is hard.

02:59.553 --> 03:02.540
And the other force that pushes against change is fear.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.748
Basic human fear.

03:05.823 --> 03:09.147
And so change has to have enough power.

03:10.333 --> 03:12.779
The power of the vision about what can be different,...

03:13.509 --> 03:17.881
...it has to have enough force and enough energy to overcome people's fears...

03:17.949 --> 03:21.072
...and to overcome the power of the status quo.
