00:12.064 --> 00:16.443
This is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students, cut down to three minutes.

00:16.769 --> 00:20.063
And it all started one day on a plane, on my way to TED seven years ago.

00:20.582 --> 00:24.823
And in the seat next to me was a high school student, a teenager,...

00:25.194 --> 00:26.925
...and she came from a really poor family.

00:27.402 --> 00:31.675
And she wanted to make something of her life, and she asked me a simple little question.

00:31.986 --> 00:33.619
She said, "What leads to success?"

00:34.325 --> 00:37.269
And I felt really badly, because I couldn't give her a good answer.

00:37.797 --> 00:39.589
So I get off the plane, and I come to TED.

00:39.878 --> 00:43.607
And I think, "Jeez, I'm in the middle of a room with successful people!"

00:43.725 --> 00:48.029
"So, why don't I ask them what helped them succeed and pass it on to kids?"

00:48.777 --> 00:52.104
So here we are, seven years, 500 interviews later,...

00:52.416 --> 00:56.803
...and I'm gonna tell you what really leads to success and makes TEDsters tick.

00:57.273 --> 00:58.997
And the first thing is passion.

00:59.712 --> 01:02.178
Freeman Thomas says, "I'm driven by my passion."

01:02.808 --> 01:04.996
TEDsters do it for love, they don't do it for money.

01:05.074 --> 01:08.433
Carol Coletta says, "I would pay someone to do what I do."

01:08.845 --> 01:11.945
And the interesting thing is, if you do it for love, the money comes anyway.

01:12.814 --> 01:13.249
Work!

01:13.442 --> 01:15.661
Rupert Murdoch said to me, "It's all hard work."

01:15.962 --> 01:17.071
"Nothing comes easily."

01:17.391 --> 01:18.530
"But I have a lot of fun."

01:19.035 --> 01:20.705
Did he say fun? Rupert?

01:21.267 --> 01:21.829
Yes!

01:23.573 --> 01:25.059
TEDsters do have fun working.

01:25.144 --> 01:26.025
And they work hard.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.827
I figured, they're not workaholics,...

01:27.996 --> 01:29.304
...they're workafrolics.

01:30.799 --> 01:31.136
Good!

01:32.681 --> 01:37.149
Alex Garden says, "To be successful, put your nose down in something and get damn good at it."

01:37.569 --> 01:40.045
There's no magic; it's practice, practice, practice.

01:40.429 --> 01:41.173
And it's focus.

01:41.259 --> 01:45.998
Norman Jewison said to me, "I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing."

01:46.727 --> 01:47.451
And push!

01:48.185 --> 01:49.865
David Gallo says, "Push yourself.

01:50.162 --> 01:52.562
Physically, mentally, you've got to push, push, push."

01:53.050 --> 01:55.127
You gotta push through shyness and self-doubt.

01:55.651 --> 01:57.693
Goldie Hawn says, "I always had self-doubts."

01:57.809 --> 01:59.649
"I wasn't good enough, I wasn't smart enough."

01:59.968 --> 02:01.235
"I didn't think I'd make it."

02:02.377 --> 02:05.831
Now, it's not always easy to push yourself, and that's why they invented mothers.

02:09.239 --> 02:12.869
Frank Gehry said to me, "My mother pushed me."

02:14.439 --> 02:15.127
Serve!

02:16.383 --> 02:19.312
Sherwin Nuland says, "It was a privilege to serve as a doctor."

02:20.075 --> 02:22.010
Now, a lot of kids tell me they want to be millionaires.

02:22.091 --> 02:25.171
And the first thing I say to them is, "Okay well, you can't serve yourself,..."

02:25.502 --> 02:27.337
"...you gotta serve others something of value,..."

02:27.470 --> 02:29.990
"...because that's the way people really get rich."

02:31.067 --> 02:34.685
Ideas. TEDster Bill Gates says, "I had an idea,..."

02:35.187 --> 02:37.738
"...founding the first microcomputer software company."

02:38.007 --> 02:39.517
I'd say it was a pretty good idea.

02:40.197 --> 02:45.108
And there's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas; it's just doing some very simple things.

02:45.337 --> 02:46.615
And I give lots of evidence.

02:47.220 --> 02:48.066
Persist.

02:48.753 --> 02:52.179
Joe Kraus says, "Persistence is the number one reason for our success."

02:52.787 --> 02:54.196
You gotta persist through failure.

02:54.345 --> 02:55.801
You've got to persist through CRAP...

02:56.119 --> 02:59.478
...which of course means "Criticism, Rejection, Assholes and Pressure."

03:02.643 --> 03:05.961
So, the big ant, the answer to this question is simple:...

03:06.350 --> 03:08.277
...pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED.

03:09.721 --> 03:12.534
Or failing that, do the eight things and trust me,...

03:12.618 --> 03:15.451
...these are the big eight things that lead to success.

03:15.783 --> 03:18.641
Thank you, TEDsters for all your interviews!
