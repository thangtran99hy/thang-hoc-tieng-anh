Many people tend to take jobs for the wrong reasons...

00:05.835 --> 00:08.536
...or because the jobs are what the family deems right.

00:09.505 --> 00:13.496
They have been programmed to follow rules, punch the proverbial time clock...

00:13.695 --> 00:16.160
...and do what is right, but not for themselves.

00:17.206 --> 00:22.001
Chasing tradition or other people's ideas about what is right for you is just wrong,...

00:22.411 --> 00:25.569
...even if it happens to be your well-meaning teachers or parents.

00:26.277 --> 00:29.266
When we turn 80, what we didn't have the guts to do...

00:29.521 --> 00:33.554
...will be far more of a problem than those things we did try that didn't work.

00:34.247 --> 00:38.676
Chasing security or someone else's dreams, isn't only insidious,...

00:39.063 --> 00:42.079
...it's guaranteed to lead to a schizophrenic existence.

00:43.079 --> 00:48.320
A recent study revealed that the number one wish of most working people was to retire.

00:48.945 --> 00:49.837
How pitiful!

00:50.567 --> 00:53.445
Passion is the investment of those chasing inner dreams,...

00:53.878 --> 00:56.737
...and one of the payoffs is living a long, happy life.

00:57.507 --> 01:00.573
Plato opened up the Academy in Athens when he was 40...

01:01.018 --> 01:03.935
...at a time when the life expectancy was 36.

01:04.504 --> 01:09.780
He ran this first university, training such stalwarts as Aristotle, until he was 80.

01:10.645 --> 01:16.018
Pursuing positive dreams arms one with high energy and leads to a long, fulfilling life.

01:16.749 --> 01:18.251
Do such people get paid?

01:18.826 --> 01:19.702
Absolutely!

01:20.154 --> 01:23.899
Those who execute positive dreams will see money by the truckload.

01:24.877 --> 01:27.201
If you're passionate, use your talents,...

01:27.492 --> 01:29.545
...and make sure someone will pay you for them.

01:30.039 --> 01:32.141
Then you'll be certain not to die in bed.
