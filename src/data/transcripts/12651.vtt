It's no secret that the language of love isn't always the most direct.

00:07.193 --> 00:10.931
Let's check out some dating lines and find out what they really mean.

00:11.787 --> 00:16.129
Line 1 : "I'd love to stay out, but I have to get up really early tomorrow."

00:16.563 --> 00:19.775
What it means : "Sorry, you just aren't floating my boat."

00:20.455 --> 00:25.447
If it's 2 AM, no problem, but if the night is young and it's the middle of dinner,...

00:25.854 --> 00:29.886
...there's no connection between you and she wants to exit sooner rather than later.

00:31.055 --> 00:33.788
Line 2: "I had such a good time with you."

00:34.311 --> 00:39.245
What it means : "Wow, you're actually fun and different from all the other guys or girls!"

00:39.905 --> 00:43.398
The person is letting you know that he or she really might like you,...

00:43.669 --> 00:48.196
...(without being too serious) and is trying to find out if you possibly feel the same.

00:48.585 --> 00:50.385
Feel free to respond in kind.

00:51.441 --> 00:54.725
Line 3: "Why don't you come over and I'll cook for you?"

00:55.085 --> 00:57.243
What it means: "Ready to get physical?"

00:57.866 --> 00:59.733
Cooking shows readiness for intimacy.

01:00.157 --> 01:03.048
The person is really inviting you into his or her life.

01:03.345 --> 01:08.530
Congratulations! If you're ready explore things further, tonight could be the night!

01:09.638 --> 01:12.749
Line 4: "I'm just not ready for a relationship."

01:13.250 --> 01:15.480
What it means: "I'm just not in love with you."

01:16.001 --> 01:21.679
It's hard, so, don't be fooled - when this person does meet someone who has that romantic spark,...

01:21.939 --> 01:24.472
...he or she will indeed be ready for a relationship.
