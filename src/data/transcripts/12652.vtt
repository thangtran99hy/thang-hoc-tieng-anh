00:02.640 --> 00:06.495
Korea's most recession proof industry is prostitution.

00:06.896 --> 00:13.808
It makes up 4 percent of GDP and as an industry has an estimated value of  22 billion dollars a year.

00:14.507 --> 00:18.409
Currently, over 500,000 women work directly as prostitutes.

00:19.316 --> 00:23.924
Prostitution is everywhere but everyone ignores it as if it doesn't exist.

00:24.519 --> 00:26.874
Despite being outlawed in 1948,...

00:27.295 --> 00:31.141
...it sometimes seems as law enforcement just turns a blind eye to it.

00:31.977 --> 00:35.079
To satisfy the public's growing outrage to clean it up,...

00:35.431 --> 00:38.147
...especially with regard to underage prostitution,...

00:38.664 --> 00:43.368
...a major "crackdown" began in 2004 with a new anti - prostitution law.

00:44.293 --> 00:48.965
One of the effects of the crackdown was to drive prostitution even more underground.

00:49.569 --> 00:52.981
Just a few years later, it's almost business as usual.

00:53.645 --> 00:55.906
The names have changed and locations, too.

00:56.429 --> 01:01.769
Amazingly, places to buy sex often have the biggest neon sign on the entire building,...

01:02.163 --> 01:07.049
...but even without a sign there are myriad ways of recognizing what is being sold.

01:07.815 --> 01:10.321
Even when prostitutes or pimps are arrested,...

01:10.705 --> 01:13.929
...the justice system may not see that a crime has been committed.

01:14.351 --> 01:18.285
One judge has decided that massage parlors where sex can be bought,...

01:18.465 --> 01:21.451
...though technically violating laws against prostitution,...

01:21.635 --> 01:24.907
...were also performing an "indispensable service" to the community.

01:25.409 --> 01:28.458
As a result charges against the accused were dropped.

01:29.281 --> 01:30.961
Maybe the problem lies here.

01:31.501 --> 01:33.945
As long as these types of attitudes towards...

01:34.027 --> 01:38.934
...prostitution and sex trafficking are held by even the highest members of the legal profession,...

01:39.217 --> 01:41.710
...there is no real hope of eradicating it.
