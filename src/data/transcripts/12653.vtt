When people communicate, they are often quite careless.

00:05.960 --> 00:10.517
It's very easy to make a general statement about something that isn't really based on fact.

00:11.014 --> 00:15.815
For example, all Americans have big noses or Korean mothers are the best.

00:16.769 --> 00:20.919
Generalizations are general statements or opinions which are only partly true...

00:21.191 --> 00:26.267
...because they are based on only a few examples or cases, or on incomplete knowledge.

00:26.979 --> 00:31.019
These judgments may be made on the fly, represent conventional wisdom,...

00:31.327 --> 00:35.059
...and feel intuitively right and yet still be wrong, offensive,...

00:35.284 --> 00:36.489
...and downright dangerous.

00:37.261 --> 00:41.729
Hasty generalizations made about others help to perpetuate stereotypes,...

00:42.041 --> 00:46.311
...damage business relationships, and keep us from truly understanding the real world,...

00:46.541 --> 00:49.317
...its people, and the relationships we share with others.

00:50.195 --> 00:55.167
Smith, who is from England, decides to attend graduate school at Ohio State University.

00:55.645 --> 00:59.010
On his first day in the U.S., he is walking around the university...

00:59.309 --> 01:02.541
...and sees two albino squirrels chasing each other around a tree.

01:03.056 --> 01:07.421
In his next letter home, he tells his family that all American squirrels are white.

01:08.499 --> 01:10.971
Imagine seeing someone for the first time and thinking.

01:11.211 --> 01:14.231
She's tall and beautiful, too. Maybe she's a model.

01:14.647 --> 01:19.259
She's wearing Prada. I saw the movie "The Devil Wears Prada." She must be a bitch.

01:19.763 --> 01:23.549
I won't talk to her first. She's smiling condescendingly at me.

01:23.873 --> 01:27.415
She must think I'm unfashionable. She's saying hello kindly.

01:27.791 --> 01:33.043
Oh, she's okay after all. Actually we don't know if she's nice or not.
