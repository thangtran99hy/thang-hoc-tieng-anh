00:02.561 --> 00:06.803
It might be the easiest word to say, and the most overused in our culture.

00:07.680 --> 00:10.527
Help out with the school's cleaning duties? Yes.

00:10.962 --> 00:14.513
Work extra late all next week at the office? Yes.

00:15.221 --> 00:20.210
Bring a main dish to the neighborhood dinner party after your 60-hour workweek? Yes.

00:20.915 --> 00:24.955
"Yes" might be the automatic, simplest or least painful response,...

00:25.392 --> 00:27.267
...even when we truly want to say no.

00:27.844 --> 00:31.308
But there is eventually a price: in stress, anger,...

00:31.420 --> 00:34.679
...passive-aggressive behavior, exhaustion and illness.

00:35.430 --> 00:40.825
Psychologists say that while women have been trained to say yes to others' needs at their own expense...

00:41.275 --> 00:45.674
...or risk being condemned as selfish, men can face the same problem.

00:46.661 --> 00:51.595
Start by making  choices. If you are invited to two social events in one evening,...

00:51.938 --> 00:53.760
...pick the one you'd prefer to go to...

00:54.069 --> 00:58.171
...and say no to the other by explaining that you have a previous commitment.

00:58.914 --> 01:03.095
When someone asks you for a favor, don't automatically say yes.

01:03.589 --> 01:06.840
Say, "I will have to check my calendar and get back to you."

01:07.533 --> 01:12.717
Really think about whether you have the time, energy or desire to do what's been asked.

01:13.346 --> 01:16.395
If you don't, get back to her promptly to say no.

01:17.412 --> 01:19.982
The reward? Your life will be simpler,...

01:20.387 --> 01:22.972
...you will be taking better care of yourself and your health,...

01:23.370 --> 01:25.601
...and you will be living a life of integrity.

01:26.057 --> 01:29.985
You'll also be happier to say yes to the things that you really want to do.
