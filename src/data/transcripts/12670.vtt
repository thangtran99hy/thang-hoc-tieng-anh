I've been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years...

00:16.044 --> 00:22.698
...and so, it's ironic that the problem and question that I most grapple with is how you actually define poverty.

00:22.773 --> 00:23.471
What does it mean?

00:23.900 --> 00:26.063
So often we look at dollar terms,...

00:26.164 --> 00:28.503
...people making less than a dollar, or two, or three a day...

00:28.537 --> 00:34.553
...and yet, the complexity of poverty really has to look at income as only one variable,...

00:34.628 --> 00:38.307
...because really, it's a condition about choice, and the lack of freedom.

00:38.999 --> 00:43.808
And I had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for me the understanding that I have.

00:44.009 --> 00:45.668
It was in Kenya and I wanna share it with you.

00:46.016 --> 00:49.956
I was with my friend Susan Meiselas, the photographer, in the Mathare Valley slums.

00:50.069 --> 00:53.033
Now, Mathare Valley is one of the oldest slums in Africa.

00:53.119 --> 00:54.968
It's about three miles out of Nairobi...

00:55.421 --> 00:57.945
...and it's a mile long, and about two-tenths of a mile wide,...

00:58.578 --> 01:02.389
...where over half a million people live crammed in these little tin shacks.

01:02.814 --> 01:06.711
Generation after generation, renting them, often eight or ten people to a room,...

01:07.267 --> 01:12.315
...and it's known for prostitution, violence, drugs.

01:13.030 --> 01:14.773
A hard place to grow up.

01:15.348 --> 01:17.350
And when we were walking through the narrow alleys,...

01:17.460 --> 01:23.702
...it was literally impossible not to step in the raw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes.

01:24.272 --> 01:28.598
But at the same time, it was also impossible not to see the human vitality,...

01:28.718 --> 01:31.752
...the aspiration, and the ambition of the people who live there.

01:31.854 --> 01:35.021
Women washing their babies, washing their clothes, hanging them out to dry.

01:35.633 --> 01:40.261
I met this woman, Mama Rose, who has rented that little tin shack for 32 years,...

01:40.568 --> 01:41.975
...where she lives with her seven children.

01:42.049 --> 01:46.654
Four sleep in one twin bed, and three sleep on the mud and linoleum floor,...

01:47.207 --> 01:50.823
...and she keeps them all in school by selling water from that kiosk,...

01:50.946 --> 01:54.933
...and selling soap and bread from the little store inside.

01:55.199 --> 01:56.935
It was also the day after the inauguration...

01:57.285 --> 02:01.061
...and I was reminded how Mathare is still connected to the globe.

02:01.481 --> 02:04.513
And I would see kids on the street corners, and they'd say, "Obama, he's our brother!"

02:04.623 --> 02:07.885
And I'd say, "Well, Obama's my brother, so that makes you my brother too."

02:08.216 --> 02:10.731
And they would look quizzically, and then be like, "High five!"

02:12.830 --> 02:14.199
And it was here that I met Jane.

02:14.886 --> 02:18.213
I was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness in her face,...

02:18.543 --> 02:19.971
...and I asked her to tell me her story.

02:20.711 --> 02:22.310
She started off by telling me her dream.

02:22.450 --> 02:23.233
She said, "I had two."

02:23.741 --> 02:25.359
"My first dream was to be a doctor..."

02:25.741 --> 02:30.275
"...and the second was to marry a good man who would stay with me and my family,..."

02:30.410 --> 02:32.266
"...because my mother was a single mom,..."

02:32.722 --> 02:34.291
"...and couldn't afford to pay for school fees."

02:34.367 --> 02:37.493
"So, I had to give up the first dream, and I focused on the second."

02:37.867 --> 02:40.453
She got married when she was 18, had a baby right away.

02:40.763 --> 02:44.715
And when she turned 20, found herself pregnant with a second child,...

02:45.499 --> 02:48.649
...her mom died, and her husband left her, married another woman.

02:48.981 --> 02:53.346
So, she was again in Mathare with no income, no skill set, no money,...

02:53.455 --> 02:55.444
...and so she ultimately turned to prostitution.

02:56.097 --> 02:58.065
It wasn't organized in the way we often think of it.

02:58.195 --> 03:00.868
She would go into the city at night with about 20 girls,...

03:01.585 --> 03:05.728
...look for work, and sometimes come back with a few shillings, or sometimes with nothing.

03:06.233 --> 03:08.019
And she said, "You know, the poverty wasn't so bad."

03:08.111 --> 03:10.501
"It was the humiliation and the embarrassment of it all."
