United States, Slovenia, Great Britain.

00:07.351 --> 00:11.503
Most of the sports that are around have been started by Brits.

00:13.055 --> 00:17.359
We start it off then everybody picks it up, and then does it better than we do.

00:19.971 --> 00:24.366
I think in some ways British people have had a problem over a long period of time...

00:24.483 --> 00:28.334
...and I'm thinking, "Oh no, we're British we've got to do it as very much amateurs!"

00:28.411 --> 00:30.523
...and it was about having a good fight.

00:30.809 --> 00:32.411
But it wasn't about winning.

00:34.118 --> 00:38.663
But I think over the last few decades, that has slowly changed.

00:43.115 --> 00:46.210
It's not a bad thing to be British and to be a winner.

00:47.215 --> 00:47.958
That's a good thing.

00:48.360 --> 00:53.913
We welcome Mr. Juan Antonio Samaranch who is presenting Mr. Steve Redgrave, OBE...

00:54.254 --> 00:58.036
...with a gold Olympic pin to acknowledge his fifth Gold Medal,...

00:58.325 --> 00:58.976
...a record.

00:59.511 --> 01:02.675
I think we've become very happy within our own skins...

01:02.863 --> 01:05.833
...because it's not embarrassing to go out and win races...

01:06.109 --> 01:10.650
...or even to say that you're the best in the field in this particular area.

01:11.548 --> 01:15.033
And I think we've been able to accept that as a nation in some ways.

01:15.307 --> 01:17.303
And certainly moving towards 2012...

01:17.382 --> 01:21.801
...and having the greatest sporting event coming to our country,...

01:22.095 --> 01:27.093
...there is an expectation that we don't just want to put on a fantastic Games.

01:27.418 --> 01:30.839
But we want our athletes to do well as well and to win some gold medals.

01:52.827 --> 01:56.901
I was asked to be helping out on the bid process.

01:57.343 --> 02:00.749
And I didn't even have to give it a thought.

02:01.069 --> 02:05.231
It was something of being able to hand something down to the next generation.

02:05.795 --> 02:06.937
That's the Aquatic over there.

02:10.151 --> 02:13.651
When the bid was suggested in the UK, that we were going to bid for the games...

02:14.540 --> 02:16.354
...there were people saying, "No, we're never gonna get it."

02:19.495 --> 02:22.201
In less than three years they'll be opening doors,...

02:22.307 --> 02:24.000
...people will be sitting in these seats,...

02:24.231 --> 02:27.199
...watching the athletes doing their bit down there.

02:28.321 --> 02:30.249
I just find that incredible in some ways,...

02:30.355 --> 02:35.119
...of so many people who put so much effort into it.

02:35.812 --> 02:37.159
But it's gonna happen,...

02:37.243 --> 02:41.022
..it's gonna succeed and it's gonna be really very, very special to be here.

02:47.515 --> 02:50.849
I'd really love to be able to compete in these games.

02:51.424 --> 02:54.731
As a 50 - year - old, I think I'd be probably struggling a little bit...

02:55.193 --> 03:00.823
...but it'll certainly be a very proud day from those humble beginnings of getting out in a boat...

03:01.240 --> 03:04.615
...to seeing the opening ceremony, seeing the flame lit.

03:06.209 --> 03:07.879
I'm gonna be one proud British guy.

03:08.342 --> 03:09.171
There's no doubt about that.
