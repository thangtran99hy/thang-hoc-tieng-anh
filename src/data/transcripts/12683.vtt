Katherine. But please call me Kathy.

00:18.602 --> 00:21.173
OK, Kathy. You can call me Changmin.

00:21.543 --> 00:25.195
OK. Do you want to go somewhere quiet, so we can talk?

It's kind of crowded here.

00:26.841 --> 00:29.423
Yeah, that's a good idea. Let's do that.

00:30.012 --> 00:31.604
Do you know any good place around here?

There's a Starbucks at the corner of 6th and 7th St.

00:35.693 --> 00:37.340
