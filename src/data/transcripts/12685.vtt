I'll go get our drinks.

Thank you. That's very sweet of you.

00:07.326 --> 00:10.367
Kathy? Hi! What are you doing here?

00:10.879 --> 00:15.250
Susie? Hi, long time no see. How have you been?

00:15.623 --> 00:17.671
I've been good. How about you?

00:17.983 --> 00:21.742
Fine. Did you enjoy yourself during the summer holidays?

00:22.057 --> 00:26.978
Yeah, I just came back from Venezuela. Are you with someone right now?

00:27.299 --> 00:32.893
Actually, yes. Oh, here he comes. Susie, this is my friend Changmin.

00:33.303 --> 00:36.446
Changmin, I'd like you to meet my best friend Susie.

00:36.785 --> 00:39.114
She's an exchange student from Venezuela.

00:39.319 --> 00:40.723
Hello, nice to meet you.

00:41.166 --> 00:44.182
Nice to meet you, too. You look familiar, though.

00:44.521 --> 00:46.870
I think we are in the same computer class.

00:47.075 --> 00:50.953
Yes. I think so, too. Sorry, I didn't recognize you at first.

00:51.193 --> 00:55.174
Oh, that's all right. I have to go. My friend is waiting for me there.

00:55.462 --> 00:56.949
I will see you around, Changmin.

00:57.154 --> 00:58.809
Yes, it was nice meeting you.
