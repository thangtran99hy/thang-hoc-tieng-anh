00:02.079 --> 00:03.419
Oh, look at the time.

00:03.631 --> 00:04.809
It's nine already.

00:05.051 --> 00:06.925
I didn't realize it was so late.

00:07.196 --> 00:07.987
I didn't, either.

00:08.375 --> 00:09.765
I'm afraid I should be going.

00:10.205 --> 00:11.793
I have an early class tomorrow morning.

00:12.154 --> 00:12.856
Me, too.

00:13.355 --> 00:15.184
 Let's get together again soon.

00:15.648 --> 00:17.831
Give me a call or send me an email.

00:18.142 --> 00:19.659
When is a good time to call you?

00:20.050 --> 00:22.160
You can call me anytime after 9.

00:22.413 --> 00:23.890
 I go to bed pretty late.

00:24.203 --> 00:26.030
What time do you usually go to bed?

00:26.461 --> 00:29.056
I usually stay awake until 2 A.M.

00:29.371 --> 00:31.015
What time do you usually get up?

00:31.598 --> 00:33.669
I get up at around 8 o'clock.

00:33.871 --> 00:36.495
Okay, I'll give you a call sometime next week.

00:37.076 --> 00:38.889
Sorry, but I'd better be going.

00:39.429 --> 00:40.761
Thank you for inviting me today.

00:41.108 --> 00:41.661
Take care.

00:42.192 --> 00:43.429
Bye. See ya!
