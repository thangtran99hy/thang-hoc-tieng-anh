00:01.505 --> 00:04.197
Sorry, I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.

00:04.391 --> 00:06.035
How long have you been waiting for?

00:06.483 --> 00:09.258
Oh, that's OK. I just got here, too. Don't worry.

00:09.603 --> 00:11.603
The cars were backed up for miles.

00:11.768 --> 00:14.615
It was one of the worst traffic  jams I've ever seen.

00:14.798 --> 00:19.924
Traffic is horrible during rush hour, and the traffic is bumper-to-bumper around this time.

00:20.503 --> 00:22.315
That's why I always take the subway.

00:22.613 --> 00:25.815
But aren't the subways also crowded during the rush hours?

00:26.004 --> 00:29.639
It is, but it's faster. It's better than wasting your time on the road.

00:30.165 --> 00:32.149
It'll take about 20 minutes on the road,..

00:32.584 --> 00:35.276
..but it'll take more than an hour with traffic jam.

00:35.801 --> 00:36.875
I guess you're right.

00:37.315 --> 00:39.663
I can't believe people who drive in the city.

00:40.069 --> 00:41.617
How can they do that every day?

00:41.969 --> 00:43.965
And parking is so expensive.

00:44.220 --> 00:45.849
How much is parking in Manhattan?

00:46.232 --> 00:51.565
Oh, it is from 14 dollars to 30 dollars an hour depending on the area you park.

00:51.741 --> 00:55.801
Wow, that's a lot. No wonder there are so many cabs in New York.
