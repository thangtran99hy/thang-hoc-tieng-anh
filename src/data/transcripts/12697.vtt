00:01.468 --> 00:02.921
Anyway, where's Susie?

00:03.221 --> 00:04.381
She went to the ladies' room.

00:04.774 --> 00:05.865
Oh, here she comes.

00:06.467 --> 00:08.783
Hi, Kathy! You finally made it!

00:09.136 --> 00:12.639
Hi, Susie! I'm so sorry to keep you guys waiting.

00:12.992 --> 00:17.175
No problem, the traffic always seems to get worse when it's raining.

00:17.507 --> 00:20.461
You're right, but you know what, I like rain.

00:20.994 --> 00:24.620
I think rain makes all things clean in the world, including me.

00:25.222 --> 00:26.677
What a nice day we're having!

00:27.018 --> 00:28.040
Yeah, I like today.

00:28.415 --> 00:29.263
It's cool, isn't it?

00:29.880 --> 00:32.649
The weather forecast says it will be cold tomorrow again.

00:32.977 --> 00:37.215
Really? These days, the weather hasn't been normal for this time of year.

00:37.654 --> 00:40.190
Changmin, what's the weather like in Korea?

00:40.461 --> 00:42.356
Well, it's also autumn in Korea...

00:42.521 --> 00:44.277
...and beautiful around this time of year.

00:44.879 --> 00:46.258
My favorite season is autumn.

00:46.611 --> 00:47.555
I miss Korea.
