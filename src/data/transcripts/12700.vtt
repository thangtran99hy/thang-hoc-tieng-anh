Hi, I'm Zeinab Badawi.

00:15.506 --> 00:19.229
I'm a television presenter and this is "See Britain Through My Eyes".

00:22.421 --> 00:26.127
I was born in Sudan at the time when the British were in power there.

00:27.180 --> 00:30.491
But I moved with my family to London when I was 2 years old.

00:31.683 --> 00:34.385
Sudan got its independence in 1956.

00:34.922 --> 00:37.922
My father had been involved in pre - independence politics...

00:38.519 --> 00:41.635
...and he ceased to be in politics and he moved into journalism.

00:42.095 --> 00:47.917
But by about '62 - '63 it was quite difficult for my father to stay in the country.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.349
There'd been a military dictatorship a few years earlier.

00:50.866 --> 00:56.147
So, he came ahead of the family and in fact he got a job with the BBC Arabic Service at Bush House.

00:58.970 --> 01:05.081
I think the key thing that we take for granted here in Britain is freedom of speech, freedom of expression.

01:06.118 --> 01:09.351
Having reported and worked in many countries abroad,...

01:09.802 --> 01:16.883
...I have seen and witnessed firsthand how there is a much tighter state control of the media.

01:17.499 --> 01:25.324
People aren't often given a true or balanced or accurate picture of what's actually going on.

01:25.735 --> 01:30.450
As we speak, there are people languishing in jail because they dared to speak out.

01:32.482 --> 01:35.340
I just stand on the steps there and I do a trail.

01:36.535 --> 01:39.225
Obviously, democracy here is an old robust one.

01:39.299 --> 01:41.352
You can vote a government in, you can vote a government out.

01:41.642 --> 01:47.517
And so, I suppose my background means that I don't take this liberty for granted...

01:47.599 --> 01:50.665
...and I believe it is a real cornerstone of democracy.

01:51.099 --> 01:51.476
Are we ready?

01:51.897 --> 01:52.143
Okay.

01:52.765 --> 01:57.234
How soon will debt - ridden Greece get the financial rescue package it's demanding?

01:57.903 --> 01:59.583
My news program "World News Today",...

01:59.665 --> 02:04.200
...it's an evening program that goes out in Britain on BBC 4 Television at 7 p.m....

02:04.293 --> 02:06.973
...and it goes out on our international channel BBC World News.

02:07.450 --> 02:10.087
We reach something like 250 million households.

02:10.159 --> 02:15.357
The outright winner in Sudan's landmark elections, the opposition say, is fraudulent.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.541
I'll do it again actually.

02:17.808 --> 02:19.328
Too long; it's gonna be too long.

02:20.225 --> 02:25.537
We really try and find stories which affect the global citizen.

02:25.833 --> 02:29.363
How will he, the country and the international community, respond?

02:29.686 --> 02:31.757
That's World News Today with me Zeinab Badawi.

02:33.555 --> 02:35.609
I should have written it and then I would have done it to time.

02:35.693 --> 02:37.559
So sorry, I was doing it a bit on the hoof.

02:37.892 --> 02:42.705
I know it's cliche to say but it's true that globalization means everybody's lives are very interlinked.

02:42.803 --> 02:44.427
We saw that with the financial crisis.
