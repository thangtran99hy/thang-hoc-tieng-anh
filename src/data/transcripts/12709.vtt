So, having this much rain is rare for this time of the year?

00:06.315 --> 00:11.100
Yes, I'm afraid that you guys have been a bit unlucky with the weather here so far.

00:11.635 --> 00:13.931
That's okay, a little bit of rain never hurts.

00:14.290 --> 00:20.045
That's true. Speaking of which, in Venezuela we have a saying, "No rain, no rainbows."

00:20.403 --> 00:21.559
Hey, I like that!

00:21.999 --> 00:25.638
People tend to forget that rain is really a necessity for life.

00:26.077 --> 00:30.770
Hey guys, not to change the subject, but are we still planning to catch a movie tonight?

00:31.043 --> 00:32.129
Yes, definitely.

00:32.313 --> 00:35.789
In fact, there's a new Bruce Willis movie now that I want to see.

00:36.183 --> 00:39.475
By the way, do you like Bruce Willis? I like him, too.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.653
He's one of my favorite actors.

00:42.021 --> 00:44.001
Yeah, he is tough and funny.

00:44.361 --> 00:47.167
That's true, but I like him because he's hot.
