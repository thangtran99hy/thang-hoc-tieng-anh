People are always asking me about the most important words in selling.

00:07.821 --> 00:09.713
My response: Two.

00:10.367 --> 00:11.832
Two words, the first one is "you".

00:12.737 --> 00:16.413
The customer buys you first, the first sale that's made is the salesperson.

00:16.831 --> 00:18.687
The first sale that's made is you.

00:19.001 --> 00:22.749
It all begins with the most important person in the world: You.

00:23.270 --> 00:28.313
Once you recognize you, then you can understand the second most important word:...

00:29.184 --> 00:30.043
...The word is "why".

00:31.056 --> 00:35.176
Why leads to the one thing you can't make sales without: Answers.

00:35.959 --> 00:39.945
Why, you, in other words, "Why are you doing this?"

00:40.465 --> 00:42.721
"What's in this for you when you're finished?"

00:44.020 --> 00:48.620
"Why are you involved in this selling profession?"

00:48.901 --> 00:49.912
"What do you have to gain out of it?"

00:50.401 --> 00:52.415
If it's money, get out of sales.

00:53.565 --> 00:57.215
If it's for some greater purpose, you're in the right place.

00:57.751 --> 00:58.804
You're there to help people.

00:59.216 --> 01:00.294
You're there to provide answers.

01:00.409 --> 01:01.499
You're there to provide value.

01:01.599 --> 01:03.746
You're there to learn your best and do your best.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.983
The second part of why is, "Why them?"

01:07.872 --> 01:09.152
"What's in it for them?"

01:09.267 --> 01:09.980
"How do they value?"

01:10.066 --> 01:10.971
"How do they benefit?"

01:11.533 --> 01:13.146
"And why should they buy from you?"

01:15.314 --> 01:19.381
Which leads you to the third part of why: Why ask?

01:20.819 --> 01:22.717
And you can even say, "Why ask 'why'?"

01:23.681 --> 01:27.600
But if you don't master the power of asking questions,...

01:27.997 --> 01:30.453
...you'll never understand the element of engagement.

01:31.772 --> 01:34.415
The two most important words are "you" and "why."

01:34.939 --> 01:38.373
If you master them, not only will you master your sales,...

01:39.065 --> 01:40.341
...you'll master your checkbook.
