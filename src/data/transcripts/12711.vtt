Hi! This is John Stewart...

00:01.650 --> 00:05.103
...and this is how to wear your pack properly for a weekend camping trip.

00:05.733 --> 00:08.813
Once you've got everything packed, you're ready to hit the trail.

00:09.373 --> 00:11.682
You gotta put your pack on properly now though.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.717
This can be easily accomplished.

00:14.483 --> 00:16.160
Get your pack while it's on the ground...

00:16.403 --> 00:19.179
...and loosen all the straps on the suspension system.

00:19.551 --> 00:23.651
Waist belt, shoulder straps, and your chest strap,...

00:24.235 --> 00:27.343
...loosen them even though you might think it's gonna be easily fitted,...

00:27.474 --> 00:28.645
...just loosen them all the way.

00:29.482 --> 00:32.781
If you have somebody there to help you get the pack up onto your shoulders,...

00:32.859 --> 00:35.809
...if not, you can just throw it right over one shoulder.

00:36.341 --> 00:39.397
And then go right back and grab your other shoulder strap,...

00:40.189 --> 00:41.652
...put both shoulder straps on.

00:42.331 --> 00:45.951
Once you have that on, you wanna buckle your waist belt first.

00:46.499 --> 00:49.160
Come down, get the waist belt buckled,...

00:49.799 --> 00:53.708
...have it sitting right on the top of your waist, right at your hip bone.

00:54.166 --> 00:57.692
This is where most of your load is gonna be, so you wanna get this right.

00:58.233 --> 01:00.146
Get it sitting right on the top of your hip bone,...

01:00.943 --> 01:03.893
...then you're gonna take, tighten your shoulder straps.

01:04.377 --> 01:08.645
Grab your two tag ends, pull down and back at the same time.

01:09.202 --> 01:10.372
Get these nice and tight.

01:10.733 --> 01:13.917
You want it to be sitting cupped right on the top of your shoulders.

01:14.501 --> 01:17.655
Once you've got that, you can buckle your chest strap.

01:18.269 --> 01:19.911
Do you have to buckle your chest strap?

01:20.371 --> 01:24.513
No, it doesn't serve any purpose, just a little bit comfortable for some people.

01:24.930 --> 01:27.080
It keeps the straps from wanting to pull off of you.

01:27.639 --> 01:29.304
So, tighten your chest strap down...

01:29.657 --> 01:33.701
...and then come back right behind your shoulders, you've got your load straps.

01:34.205 --> 01:38.422
Pull these nice and tight so that the load is right there on your shoulders, okay?

01:39.163 --> 01:41.754
Once you've done these things, you're ready to hit the trail,...

01:42.164 --> 01:43.603
...take off, and have a good time.

01:44.233 --> 01:48.517
And this is how to pack your pack, and wear it properly for a weekend camping trip.
