So Changmin, when you weren't out for hiking, what were you doing in Korea?

00:07.245 --> 00:09.519
You mean, what did I do most of the time?

00:09.725 --> 00:10.501
Exactly!

00:11.157 --> 00:14.953
Well, when I was a student, I spent most of my time playing basketball.

00:15.363 --> 00:18.556
I see. Were you involved in any clubs at your school?

00:19.117 --> 00:21.634
Actually, I was a member of the newspaper club.

00:22.155 --> 00:24.421
I worked as a writer for my school's newspaper.

00:24.737 --> 00:29.512
No kidding! That sounds really interesting! What kind of things did you write about?

00:29.779 --> 00:33.589
Mostly school affairs. I was in charge of covering our school's election.

00:34.109 --> 00:34.837
Election?

00:35.058 --> 00:38.131
Yes. I wrote articles about each of the major candidates;...

00:38.553 --> 00:42.333
...what their opinions were, what they were like as students, and so on.

00:42.703 --> 00:44.513
That must have been a lot of fun.
