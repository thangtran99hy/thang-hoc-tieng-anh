What's that you're reading, Kathy?

00:03.664 --> 00:06.423
This? Oh, it's a new novel I just bought.

00:06.680 --> 00:09.606
I'm just starting it, but so far it seems pretty good.

00:09.891 --> 00:11.096
Do you like reading books?

00:11.508 --> 00:13.187
Yes, it's one of my hobbies.

00:13.485 --> 00:14.493
Can I have a look at it?

00:14.751 --> 00:18.545
Sure. It's the latest book by Stephen King. Do you like him?

00:18.922 --> 00:20.725
Have you ever read any of his books?

00:20.890 --> 00:24.745
No, but I've definitely heard of him. He's really famous, isn't he?

00:25.026 --> 00:29.798
Yes, he is. In fact, he's one of the most famous authors in America.

00:30.350 --> 00:34.046
His books are always so scary; I love scary novels.

00:34.248 --> 00:37.223
I think they're OK, but I prefer spy thrillers.

00:37.455 --> 00:40.985
Ah, you mean books with a lot of action and adventure?

00:41.083 --> 00:45.495
Yes, they're real page-turners. My favorite novel is "Harry Potter."

00:45.793 --> 00:47.867
Harry Potter? I hate it.
