What are you up to tonight, Changmin?

00:04.266 --> 00:09.435
Tonight is my "TV night." I always stay in and watch my favorite TV shows on Thursdays.

00:09.832 --> 00:13.003
Oh, I see. What do you usually do on the weekend?

00:13.299 --> 00:15.477
I sometimes go out and play basketball.

00:15.771 --> 00:18.943
When I don't feel like going out, I stay home and watch TV.

00:19.305 --> 00:21.202
How often do you play basketball?

00:21.437 --> 00:23.891
I sometimes play basketball with my friends.

00:24.466 --> 00:27.997
But I like to stay home and relax in front of the television most of the time.

00:28.260 --> 00:32.716
Yeah, I realized that many Koreans like watching TV very much.

00:32.872 --> 00:37.325
Yes, they do. Like my family, they watch TV all the time!

00:37.629 --> 00:40.163
How many hours a day do they watch TV?

00:40.629 --> 00:43.857
Well, basically, if they are at home, the TV is on.

00:44.159 --> 00:47.748
So I guess they watch TV at least six or seven hours a day.

00:47.979 --> 00:49.501
That seems like a lot.
