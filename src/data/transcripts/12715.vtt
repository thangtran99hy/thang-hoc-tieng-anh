What are your plans for the weekend, Changmin?

00:04.911 --> 00:09.559
Nothing much, really. I might meet up with a few of my Korean friends and have some drinks.

00:09.925 --> 00:12.227
How about you? What are you doing this weekend?

00:12.539 --> 00:13.855
I might go to church.

00:14.227 --> 00:15.773
Do you go to church every Sunday?

00:16.131 --> 00:17.574
Yes, most of the time.

00:17.860 --> 00:22.501
But I am going to visit my grandfather in two weeks, so I can't go to church then.

00:22.820 --> 00:25.079
Don't you usually go to church on Sundays?

00:25.253 --> 00:29.225
Actually, I am a Buddhist, so I don't really go to church services.

00:29.575 --> 00:33.780
A Buddhist? Wow, I think you're the first buddhist I've ever met!

00:34.073 --> 00:36.331
Well, there are a lot of Buddhists in Korea.

00:36.632 --> 00:40.284
I'm not sure, but I think about half of the population are Buddhists.

00:40.979 --> 00:43.033
I guess most Americans are Christians, right?

00:43.281 --> 00:44.071
You're right.
