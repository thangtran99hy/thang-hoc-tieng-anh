Hey guys! Good to see you both again. How was your weekend?

00:05.441 --> 00:08.478
Hi Changmin, I had a great time last weekend.

00:08.804 --> 00:12.583
I went on a camping trip by the lake with a bunch of my friends.

00:13.059 --> 00:16.368
That sounds like fun! I wish I did something like that.

00:16.900 --> 00:18.869
How come? What did you do, Kathy?

00:19.254 --> 00:23.487
Oh, I did nothing special. I just hung out here with some friends.

00:23.807 --> 00:26.853
We went out drinking on both Friday and Saturday nights.

00:27.156 --> 00:30.461
Well, sounds familiar. I went out drinking with my friends as well.

00:30.973 --> 00:32.671
I think I still have a hangover.

00:33.061 --> 00:38.559
Hey, that's not so bad guys. There's nothing wrong with meeting your friends for a few drinks.

00:38.892 --> 00:40.058
How much did you drink?

00:40.213 --> 00:42.337
I don't remember. I blacked out.
