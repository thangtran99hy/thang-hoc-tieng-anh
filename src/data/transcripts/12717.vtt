00:03.281 --> 00:06.551
By the way, have either of you seen the latest Batman movie?

00:06.910 --> 00:08.037
Yeah, I saw it.

00:08.400 --> 00:09.463
How did you like the movie?

00:09.958 --> 00:11.983
Well, I didn't like it all that much.

00:12.351 --> 00:14.369
Really? Why not? I loved it!

00:14.997 --> 00:17.323
I thought the special effects weren't that good,...

00:17.850 --> 00:20.429
...and I was really disappointed with the storyline.

00:20.588 --> 00:24.467
No kidding! I was on the edge of my seat right up until the end.

00:25.017 --> 00:27.125
How about you, Susie, have you seen it?

00:27.451 --> 00:32.557
Yes, I liked it very much, but I'm definitely the wrong person to ask about Batman.

00:32.679 --> 00:33.766
Oh? Why's that?

00:34.275 --> 00:36.671
I'm not into superhero movies at all.

00:36.951 --> 00:39.965
To be honest, science fiction movies aren't my thing.

00:40.307 --> 00:42.609
Well, I guess we can disagree on that, then.

00:42.903 --> 00:43.693
I guess so.

00:43.889 --> 00:46.138
But at least we do agree on tonight's movie.
