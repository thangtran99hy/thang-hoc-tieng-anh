So tell me a little about yourself, Changmin.

00:04.889 --> 00:06.704
Sure! What would you like to know?

00:07.000 --> 00:08.565
Well, what are your hobbies?

00:08.909 --> 00:12.864
I have no hobbies in particular, but I enjoy hiking a lot.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.875
There are so many beautiful mountains in Korea.

00:16.212 --> 00:17.435
That sounds great!

00:17.841 --> 00:20.929
How about you, Kathy? What do you like to do in your spare time?

00:21.295 --> 00:23.264
My hobby is collecting stamps.

00:23.525 --> 00:25.758
I especially collect Christmas stamps.

00:26.079 --> 00:28.042
I also like to drive out of town.

00:28.269 --> 00:30.453
Driving? Your hobby is driving?

00:30.592 --> 00:34.114
Sure! I like to get out of the city as much as possible.

00:34.359 --> 00:36.697
There's a lot of beautiful countryside to see.

00:37.031 --> 00:38.681
How often do you go for a drive?

00:38.958 --> 00:40.793
Not as often as I'd like to.

00:41.140 --> 00:43.237
I guess I go at least once a month, though.
