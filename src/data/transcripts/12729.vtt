Have you joined any of the school clubs?

00:04.671 --> 00:06.307
No, I haven't joined any clubs.

00:06.909 --> 00:09.171
But I decided to join the basketball club.

00:09.569 --> 00:11.620
I think joining clubs is very important.

00:11.907 --> 00:16.749
Definitely! It's a great way to meet people, also a way to have a lot of fun.

00:17.061 --> 00:19.651
Actually, I've already made up my mind to join.

00:19.947 --> 00:22.845
How about you, Kathy? Are you a member of any clubs here?

00:23.420 --> 00:24.706
Yes, I am, actually.

00:24.978 --> 00:27.308
Have you heard of the "Friends of the Disabled" club?

00:27.549 --> 00:29.071
No, I don't think I have.

00:29.505 --> 00:30.913
Do you work with disabled people?

00:31.375 --> 00:34.413
Yes, we do. Both kids and adults.

00:34.845 --> 00:39.409
Last Saturday, we took a  group of kids to the park and taught them how to in-line skate.

00:39.611 --> 00:41.435
Hey, that sounds really great!

00:42.086 --> 00:43.763
Maybe I will join your club, too.

00:43.996 --> 00:45.650
Sure! Just let me know.

00:45.900 --> 00:47.826
New people are always welcome.

00:47.957 --> 00:51.407
Okay, I'm definitely going to do that then. Thanks.
