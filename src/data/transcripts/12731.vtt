Hey Kathy, Changmin, how are you guys doing?

00:05.363 --> 00:06.538
Did you enjoy the holiday?

00:07.025 --> 00:11.355
Hi Susie. Yes, I had a great time. I recharged my batteries.

00:11.989 --> 00:16.253
Yes, I enjoyed the holiday, too, I guess, but I'm a bit tired.

00:16.959 --> 00:20.702
You don't sound very convincing there, and you look tired.

00:21.025 --> 00:23.081
Why didn't you take a rest during the weekend?

00:23.295 --> 00:23.961
I did rest.

00:24.529 --> 00:27.707
It's just that I had planned to get a lot of work done over the holiday,...

00:28.195 --> 00:29.766
...but I ended up doing nothing.

00:30.209 --> 00:32.023
What kind of work did you want to do?

00:32.459 --> 00:35.629
Well, I have a big project due for my computer science class.

00:35.983 --> 00:39.444
I see what you mean, but I don't think you should worry too much about it.

00:40.015 --> 00:40.906
Susie's right.

00:41.325 --> 00:45.431
I wish you had done it before, but there's still plenty of time left in this semester.

00:45.701 --> 00:48.830
Yes, but I really think I should have gotten more work done.
