You know for me, the interest in contemporary forms of slavery...

00:20.722 --> 00:22.446
...started with a leaflet that I picked up in London.

00:22.516 --> 00:25.897
It was the early '90s and I was at a public event.

00:26.697 --> 00:28.431
And I saw this leaflet and it said,...

00:29.185 --> 00:32.050
"There are millions of slaves in the world today."

00:32.135 --> 00:35.717
And I thought, "No way, no way."

00:36.434 --> 00:38.019
And I'm going to admit to hubris...

00:39.179 --> 00:42.143
...because I'm going to admit to you, I also thought,...

00:42.700 --> 00:44.365
"How can I be like a hotshot;"

00:44.462 --> 00:48.126
"young, full professor who teaches human rights, and not know this?"...

00:48.333 --> 00:49.199
...so it can't be true.

00:50.109 --> 00:54.101
Well if you teach, if you worship in the temple of learning,...

00:54.548 --> 00:55.892
...do not mock the gods...

00:56.565 --> 01:02.860
...because they will take you, fill you with curiosity and desire, and drive you;...

01:03.306 --> 01:06.217
...drive you with a passion to change things.

01:07.706 --> 01:09.374
I went out and did a lit review.

01:09.779 --> 01:12.109
3,000 articles on the keyword "slavery".

01:12.470 --> 01:14.886
Two turned out to be about contemporary, only two.

01:15.888 --> 01:17.277
All the rest of it were historical.

01:17.631 --> 01:20.412
They were press pieces and they were full of outrage.

01:20.686 --> 01:21.949
They were full of speculation.

01:22.017 --> 01:22.867
They were anecdotal,...

01:23.233 --> 01:24.902
...no solid information.

01:25.489 --> 01:27.754
So, I began to do a research project of my own.

01:28.119 --> 01:29.769
I went to five countries around the world.

01:30.100 --> 01:31.752
I looked at slaves.

01:31.830 --> 01:33.015
I met slaveholders.

01:33.330 --> 01:37.767
And I looked very deeply into slave - based businesses...

01:38.085 --> 01:39.696
...because this is an economic crime.

01:40.117 --> 01:44.101
People do not enslave people to be mean to them.

01:44.297 --> 01:45.351
They do it to make a profit.

01:46.327 --> 01:48.511
And I've got to tell you, what I found out in the world,...

01:48.594 --> 01:53.281
...in four different continents was depressingly familiar...

01:53.883 --> 01:54.484
...like this.

01:56.181 --> 01:59.704
Agricultural workers in Africa whipped and beaten,...

02:00.268 --> 02:06.838
...showing us how they were beaten in the fields before they escaped from slavery and met up with our film crew.

02:08.731 --> 02:09.673
It was mind-blowing.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.517
And I want to be very clear,...

02:14.202 --> 02:16.672
...I'm talking about real slavery.

02:17.022 --> 02:18.695
This is not about lousy marriages.

02:18.783 --> 02:20.284
This is not about jobs that suck.

02:20.696 --> 02:23.159
This is about people who cannot walk away,...

02:23.506 --> 02:25.437
...people who are forced to work without pay,...

02:25.809 --> 02:32.715
...people who are operating twenty-four seven under a threat of violence and have no pay.

02:33.239 --> 02:38.781
It's real slavery in exactly the same way that slavery would be recognized throughout all of human history.
