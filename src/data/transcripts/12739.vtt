Kathy, I hope this isn't too personal of a question,...

00:06.056 --> 00:08.045
...but are you dating anyone at the moment?

00:08.616 --> 00:12.555
Am I dating anyone? Well, no, not really. Why?

00:12.797 --> 00:13.488
Just curious.

00:14.098 --> 00:17.021
I was just wondering about the whole dating scene here in America.

00:17.507 --> 00:20.190
Well, do men usually ask women out first?

00:20.674 --> 00:23.305
They generally do. What's up Changmin?

00:23.608 --> 00:25.310
Have you met someone special lately?

00:25.629 --> 00:29.289
Well, to tell you the truth, there's a girl that I'm interested in.

00:29.868 --> 00:31.607
Can you give me some advice about love?

00:32.069 --> 00:33.971
Maybe I can give you some advice.

00:34.221 --> 00:36.341
Go on. So, did you ask her out?

00:36.499 --> 00:39.592
No, not yet. I don't know what she thinks of me.

00:39.965 --> 00:42.725
Changmin, I think you should be honest with yourself.

00:42.961 --> 00:44.619
The best thing is to be yourself.

00:44.912 --> 00:47.436
Thanks. I really appreciate  your advice.
