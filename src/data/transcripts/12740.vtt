Hey, Changmin. Can you do me a favor?

00:04.185 --> 00:06.501
Sure, I'd be happy to. What's wrong?

00:06.877 --> 00:10.321
Well, I've been having a lot of trouble with my computer lately.

00:10.767 --> 00:14.425
I'm not very good with computers, so I don't really know what to do.

00:14.601 --> 00:16.916
I see. What is going wrong?

00:17.411 --> 00:20.773
It keeps shutting down whenever I open up a certain program.

00:21.017 --> 00:24.735
Uh-oh. That doesn't sound very good. You might have a virus.

00:25.006 --> 00:27.140
Have you had your computer checked for viruses?

00:27.455 --> 00:32.431
Viruses? No, I haven't. Would you mind checking my computer for viruses?

00:32.585 --> 00:35.175
Sure, I have a program on a disk that will help.

00:35.713 --> 00:36.999
Why don't I go home and get it,...

00:37.299 --> 00:40.173
...then we can meet up and try using it on your computer?

00:40.406 --> 00:43.489
That sounds great, Changmin. I really appreciate your help!

00:43.785 --> 00:44.801
I owe you big.
