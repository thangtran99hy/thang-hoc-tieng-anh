00:02.159 --> 00:04.123
Do you guys have any plans for this Saturday?

00:04.721 --> 00:07.120
No, I don't have any plans, why?

00:07.473 --> 00:09.045
I'm free all day Saturday.

00:09.245 --> 00:10.330
What do you want to do?

00:10.777 --> 00:13.531
Well, I've always wanted to go to the Museum of Modern Art.

00:14.105 --> 00:16.481
I've heard there are a lot of great exhibits there.

00:16.905 --> 00:20.959
Yeah. They have a really big collection of contemporary paintings.

00:21.243 --> 00:24.713
Great! Then why don't we all go together this Saturday?

00:24.980 --> 00:25.866
Sounds good.

00:26.236 --> 00:27.615
What's a good time to meet?

00:27.924 --> 00:30.680
How about meeting at 12:00 at the main gate?

00:30.965 --> 00:33.435
I have an appointment with Susie at that time.

00:33.673 --> 00:34.771
How about 3:00?

00:35.212 --> 00:36.151
That works for me.

00:36.548 --> 00:37.649
Main gate at 3:00.

00:37.889 --> 00:38.741
I'll be there!
