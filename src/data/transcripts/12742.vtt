Hello, Kathy? This is Changmin.

00:04.011 --> 00:07.544
Changmin! Hey, are you all right? You sound terrible!

00:07.850 --> 00:11.095
I think I'm coming down with something. That's why I called you.

00:11.579 --> 00:14.573
Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that. What's wrong?

00:15.481 --> 00:18.639
I'm not sure. I've had a terrible headache all day.

00:19.050 --> 00:21.439
Really? Did you take any painkillers?

00:21.796 --> 00:24.013
Yes, but I don't think they're working.

00:25.002 --> 00:28.440
Anyway, we're supposed to meet today to go to the museum,...

00:28.881 --> 00:30.581
...but I'm afraid I can't make it.

00:30.897 --> 00:32.977
Can we postpone our meeting to tomorrow?

00:33.259 --> 00:37.320
Please Changmin, take care first. We can meet up some other time, then.

00:37.754 --> 00:41.121
I'm sorry that you don't feel well and I hope that you get better soon.

00:42.603 --> 00:44.887
Sorry, Kathy. It won't happen again.
