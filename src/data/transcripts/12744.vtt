Hello there. Is there something I can help you with?

00:05.682 --> 00:10.057
Yes, I was wondering if it would be possible to reserve a classroom.

00:10.265 --> 00:13.537
You need to use a classroom? Is this for personal use?

00:13.779 --> 00:17.951
No, it's for my club. I'm the president of "Friends of the Disabled"...

00:18.101 --> 00:20.944
...and we were hoping to use a room for our next meeting.

00:21.117 --> 00:26.135
I see. You need to ask the professor for permission, then it shouldn't be a problem.

00:26.414 --> 00:30.092
Okay, sounds great. Do you happen to know how big the room is?

00:30.367 --> 00:35.829
It's a regular lecture hall, so I imagine it has about 50 to 60 desks in it.

00:36.436 --> 00:40.120
That will be plenty big enough for us. Thank you very much for your help.

00:40.302 --> 00:44.081
No trouble at all. Feel free to see me when you have questions.
