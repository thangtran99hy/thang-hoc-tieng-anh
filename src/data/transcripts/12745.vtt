Well guys, next week is the final exam week.

00:06.082 --> 00:08.113
I hope you both ace all of your tests!

00:08.968 --> 00:12.962
I definitely studied a lot, but I'm not so sure that I'm ready for them.

00:13.215 --> 00:15.164
Me, too. I'm really nervous.

00:15.685 --> 00:18.937
If I don't do well, my family will be very disappointed in me.

00:19.265 --> 00:21.915
Don't worry. I'm sure you'll do well on your tests.

00:22.729 --> 00:24.511
Any tips that you'd like to give us?

00:24.947 --> 00:30.055
Well, be sure to review all the material you studied in class and you'll be all set!

00:30.581 --> 00:32.424
I hope you pass the final exam.

00:32.723 --> 00:34.145
It's easier said than done.

00:34.704 --> 00:37.077
I think I have to cram for all of my tests.

00:37.917 --> 00:39.287
I bet you'll do fine.

00:39.473 --> 00:39.974
Cheer up!

00:40.581 --> 00:44.169
Why don't we all go out together after the exams and have a few drinks?

00:44.406 --> 00:45.089
It's on me!

00:45.484 --> 00:45.950
I'm in!

00:46.247 --> 00:46.963
Me, too!
