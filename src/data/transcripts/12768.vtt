Changmin, I didn't catch what the professor said just now.

00:06.750 --> 00:08.157
Can you explain that to me?

00:08.389 --> 00:10.384
OK. What didn't you understand?

00:10.860 --> 00:14.786
The part about the plates in the Earth and how they can cause volcanoes.

00:14.985 --> 00:16.351
Sure, I'd be happy to.

00:16.986 --> 00:20.617
The Earth is made up of a series of plates and where the plates meet,...

00:21.039 --> 00:22.959
...they sometimes push against each other.

00:23.269 --> 00:24.424
Right, I see.

00:24.876 --> 00:26.966
Sometimes that causes mountains to form,...

00:27.460 --> 00:29.736
...and it can also cause volcanoes to occur.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.091
What do you mean?

00:31.248 --> 00:35.169
Are you saying it's basically the pressure that causes some volcanoes to erupt?

00:35.416 --> 00:36.695
Yes, exactly.

00:37.154 --> 00:41.371
Okay, I get it now. Thanks so much, Changmin. You're a big help!

00:41.691 --> 00:42.842
No problem at all.
