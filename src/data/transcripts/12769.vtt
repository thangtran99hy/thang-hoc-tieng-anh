When I was younger, I was a musician...

00:31.461 --> 00:34.535
...and at some point, my mother became a little bit desperate and said,...

00:34.632 --> 00:37.282
"Well, it's probably time for you to find a proper job."

00:37.881 --> 00:41.554
And she saw this advertising for a position at Hertz,...

00:41.718 --> 00:44.634
...which I applied for in the middle of August when I was on the beach...

00:45.097 --> 00:47.445
...and surprisingly, I'd been hired by Hertz.

00:52.838 --> 00:55.427
I was taking the reservations, washing the cars.

00:56.625 --> 00:58.541
Now I'm running Hertz International,...

00:58.619 --> 01:02.577
...which is essentially everything outside the American continent...

01:02.681 --> 01:06.145
...which we really animate and run from here, from this place.

01:08.762 --> 01:10.533
And like a lot of American companies,...

01:10.931 --> 01:15.330
...they elected to locate the international head office in the UK.

01:15.919 --> 01:21.321
I think the UK has a lot of strength which is appealing to companies.

01:23.993 --> 01:25.987
One of course, is the language.

01:26.753 --> 01:30.399
But also much more easily here in the UK than in other places,...

01:30.550 --> 01:32.942
...you find an accountant, we call them CPA,...

01:33.361 --> 01:35.695
...so we have the knowledge of American accounting rules.

01:37.001 --> 01:39.886
Britain is also what we call an important source market...

01:40.201 --> 01:45.752
...and I mean by this that the British people travel a lot outside of the UK.

01:46.097 --> 01:49.187
People like to discover different regions...

01:49.680 --> 01:52.065
...so, it's an important source of business for us.

01:53.018 --> 01:58.768
I think it is a country where retail is almost like an art and a science at the same time.

01:59.248 --> 02:01.657
I find UK people very pragmatic,...

02:01.961 --> 02:06.082
...very much looking forward to this new world which is moving so fast.

02:06.931 --> 02:08.839
They are very Internet savvy.

02:10.301 --> 02:12.079
That makes the UK really attractive...

02:12.351 --> 02:16.772
...because you can apply what you do and what you learn in the UK to other geographies.
