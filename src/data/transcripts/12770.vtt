We are present in 140 countries, so it's very important to have talent from different cultures...

00:07.395 --> 00:13.556
...and it's such a cosmopolitan place that you can attract, retain talent from anywhere in the world.

00:14.764 --> 00:18.770
Out of 18 people who report directly to me, we have 10 different nationalities.

00:19.404 --> 00:23.435
People are very tolerant, very open to difference...

00:23.833 --> 00:25.125
...and I think it's a great attribute.

00:25.627 --> 00:29.015
Here I am, a Frenchman working for an American company,...

00:29.681 --> 00:32.396
...leading an international division based in the UK.

00:32.816 --> 00:35.859
I don't think this would happen easily anywhere else, frankly.

00:37.885 --> 00:41.893
Not only do I like working, but I love living in Britain.

00:46.646 --> 00:50.629
Well apart from the fact that for whatever reason that nobody in the rest of the world understands,...

00:50.803 --> 00:52.954
...you guys are driving on the wrong side of the road,...

00:53.651 --> 00:55.624
...I would say it's very pleasant to drive in the UK.

00:56.505 --> 01:01.956
I think British drivers are careful, are very respectful, polite.

01:04.990 --> 01:08.816
You systematically let pedestrians cross the road...

01:09.763 --> 01:14.629
...and one stops, which is in a big city quite amazing to me compared to other big cities.

01:16.101 --> 01:21.276
The rate of accidents is significantly lower in the UK than it is in other countries...

01:21.692 --> 01:26.575
...which says something significant about the character of the British population.

01:30.652 --> 01:34.521
This being said, I wouldn't say that British people are slaves to the rules;...

01:34.642 --> 01:35.976
...actually, they are very creative.

01:36.190 --> 01:37.731
I think British people can get crazy.

01:40.005 --> 01:47.603
This creativity mixed with the solid structure of tolerance and respect is actually a very good product in the end.

01:49.541 --> 01:53.546
That's what makes it really enjoyable and a unique place.
