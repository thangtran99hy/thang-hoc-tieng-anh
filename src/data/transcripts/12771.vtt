My name is Sebastien Noel.

00:16.005 --> 00:21.409
I'm one of the three founding directors of Troika together with Conny Freyer and Eva Rucki.

00:21.821 --> 00:25.544
Troika is an art and design studio based in London.

00:25.641 --> 00:26.353
I'm from France.

00:26.425 --> 00:27.944
The two other are from Germany.

00:28.390 --> 00:30.925
And this is "See Britain Through Troika's Eyes"

00:36.151 --> 00:38.099
I was originally working in Italy...

00:38.213 --> 00:45.180
...and very soon I felt the need to go and do a postgraduate in design.

00:47.242 --> 00:49.982
And I guess I chose to come here in England...

00:50.061 --> 00:52.029
...because you have the Royal College of Art...

00:52.119 --> 00:55.184
...which was one of the best schools in Europe.

00:55.419 --> 00:58.377
Already during college time we had worked together quite a lot.

00:59.097 --> 01:04.302
So, I decided to set up a studio a year after leaving the college.

01:05.593 --> 01:14.807
I think in general, clients in the UK are quite happy to take well comparably quite large risks...

01:14.899 --> 01:21.061
...like commissioning people coming out of their degree.

01:23.673 --> 01:26.995
For British Airways we created a five-meter-long sculpture,...

01:27.387 --> 01:33.944
...two-meter-wide, one-meter-tall that is suspended in the first class interior in Terminal Five, Heathrow.

01:35.081 --> 01:40.114
It is covered with 5,000 little mirrors like that, that can flip from one side to the other...

01:40.280 --> 01:42.719
...so we can animate the whole skin of the sculpture.

01:43.793 --> 01:48.095
This is what was used in old train stations and airports to display information...

01:48.179 --> 01:49.704
...and go...

01:53.223 --> 01:56.043
We're kind of re-exploring an older technology...

01:56.135 --> 02:01.098
...and see what kind of identity it could have over a more conventional technique.
