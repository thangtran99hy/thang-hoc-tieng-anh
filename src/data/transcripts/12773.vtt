Thank you so much for coming with me, Kathy.

00:03.221 --> 00:04.299
Oh, no problem.

00:04.451 --> 00:07.325
I love shopping, even if it's just window-shopping.

00:07.773 --> 00:10.405
So, shall we take a look at some of the options?

00:10.561 --> 00:11.019
OK.

00:11.493 --> 00:13.854
Wow, those are pretty notebooks.

00:14.065 --> 00:16.246
Can I get $10 worth of these?

00:16.901 --> 00:18.917
Sure, do you need anything else?

00:19.228 --> 00:20.356
Actually, yes.

00:20.623 --> 00:22.843
Can you recommend a good MP3 player?

00:22.996 --> 00:25.855
Sure, we have quite a few good ones here.

00:26.243 --> 00:28.587
This is our most popular model.

00:29.096 --> 00:30.571
That one looks really nice.

00:30.740 --> 00:31.373
How much is it?

00:32.058 --> 00:34.100
This one sells for $200.

00:34.571 --> 00:38.391
It's a top-of-the-line model, so it's more expensive than the others.

00:38.883 --> 00:40.297
$200!

00:40.505 --> 00:42.031
That seems expensive!

00:42.195 --> 00:44.251
Yeah, that's out of my price range.

00:44.691 --> 00:46.061
Can you give me a discount?
