Hello?

00:03.247 --> 00:05.373
Hello sir, how are you this evening?

00:05.587 --> 00:06.979
Can I speak to Mr. Kim?

00:07.546 --> 00:09.978
I'm fine, thank you. This is Kim Changmin.

00:10.517 --> 00:11.859
May I ask who's calling, please?

00:12.311 --> 00:14.133
This is Jeff Copeland calling.

00:14.463 --> 00:17.131
I'm a representative of Wandex Investments.

00:17.777 --> 00:18.200
Yes?

00:18.685 --> 00:22.617
I'd like to let you know about some great investment opportunities.

00:23.314 --> 00:25.744
Well, uh, I think you have the wrong number.

00:26.274 --> 00:28.623
I'm not really looking to invest any money right now.

00:29.199 --> 00:34.789
We're offering a great investment deal and I'm sure you will be interested after you hear about it.

00:35.441 --> 00:39.120
Well, to be honest with you, I'm a little bit busy at the moment.

00:39.637 --> 00:42.788
OK, I see. Then have a good day, sir.
