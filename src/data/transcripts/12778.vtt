00:01.727 --> 00:04.525
Hello, may I speak to Mrs. Jones, please?

00:04.936 --> 00:07.709
I'm sorry, but Mrs. Jones isn't in at the moment.

00:07.987 --> 00:09.235
May I ask who's calling?

00:09.617 --> 00:12.087
Yes, my name is Kathy Jackson.

00:12.347 --> 00:16.049
I spoke with her last week about the possibility of working there.

00:16.583 --> 00:20.897
Kathy Jackson. Yes, I think I recognize your name.

00:21.399 --> 00:24.642
Do you happen to know if your company is looking for anyone now?

00:25.304 --> 00:28.257
I'm afraid I'm not the right person to ask about that.

00:28.632 --> 00:31.069
You'll need to speak directly to Mrs. Jones.

00:31.403 --> 00:33.482
But she can't answer the phone right now.

00:33.863 --> 00:37.888
Okay, I understand. Well, could I leave a message for her, please?

00:38.218 --> 00:41.485
Certainly. Is there a number that she can reach you at?

00:41.901 --> 00:44.467
Actually, I don't have a number with me now.

00:44.748 --> 00:45.821
I'll call back later.

00:46.240 --> 00:49.253
Okay, I will give her the message that you will call back.

00:49.569 --> 00:50.848
Thank you very much.
