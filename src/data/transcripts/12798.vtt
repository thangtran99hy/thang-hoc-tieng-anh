00:00.050 --> 00:02.357
OK. So, tips for jogging.

00:02.950 --> 00:07.638
So, these are some key tips you want to incorporate when you're starting a jogging program.

00:08.234 --> 00:09.790
So, when you're out for a run,...

00:10.232 --> 00:14.482
...you wanna pay attention to how you're using your overall body form.

00:14.991 --> 00:16.169
So, when you're running...

00:16.660 --> 00:20.906
...you wanna make sure that you're running and you have nice straight arms going.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.447
You don't wanna have your arms going from side to side...

00:24.517 --> 00:27.934
...because you become less efficient as a jogger...

00:28.203 --> 00:31.479
...when you're running with your arms in this manner, OK?

00:31.961 --> 00:34.211
And another thing that you want to pay attention to is...

00:34.620 --> 00:38.008
...while you're running, you don't wanna be completely vertical like this.

00:39.812 --> 00:46.287
What you want to do is have more of a slight lean forward with your waist.

00:46.931 --> 00:50.815
So, another common mistake that many joggers make when they are out for a run is...

00:51.204 --> 00:54.021
...they are sort of running in like an almost sitting motion...

00:54.118 --> 00:57.263
...where this part of their body is in a downward motion like this.

00:57.609 --> 01:01.827
And they are running, and they are just like that.

01:02.335 --> 01:08.582
So, what I tell my clients when I see them running with that type of motion is to come up...

01:09.205 --> 01:12.925
...instead of sitting and running in this motion.

01:13.053 --> 01:16.799
What you wanna do is you wanna come up, have your slight lean,...

01:17.295 --> 01:19.614
...make sure that your arms are in a nice straight motion.

01:22.265 --> 01:26.386
OK. So, another key component for joggers is foot placement,...

01:26.856 --> 01:28.672
...how you place your feet when you're running.

01:29.147 --> 01:30.883
So, clients that I've had in the past...

01:31.262 --> 01:34.727
...when they are running, their feet are sort of coming out to the side like this.

01:35.502 --> 01:35.731
Ok.

01:36.032 --> 01:44.417
So, instead of running with your feet going at this angle to the side,...

01:45.133 --> 01:52.119
...what you want to do to be more efficient is make sure that your feet are nice and straight.
