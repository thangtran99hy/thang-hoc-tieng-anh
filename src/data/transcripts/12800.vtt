00:01.736 --> 00:04.225
Alright, let's talk about some guidelines.

00:04.579 --> 00:06.577
Running is a really simple sport.

00:06.653 --> 00:08.074
It doesn't require a lot of equipment.

00:08.179 --> 00:10.904
However, there are a few guidelines that you might wanna think about...

00:10.993 --> 00:12.320
...before starting your running program.

00:13.583 --> 00:16.971
First, you wanna make sure that you warm up properly...

00:17.062 --> 00:18.308
...before going out on a run.

00:18.850 --> 00:21.165
Muscles need to be warmed up as well as the joints.

00:21.390 --> 00:23.294
So, I recommend before ever going out on a run...

00:23.385 --> 00:26.357
...is to warm up for a couple of minutes very slowly.

00:26.440 --> 00:29.210
You might wanna start walking first...

00:29.440 --> 00:32.517
...and then proceed to go into your run.

00:32.777 --> 00:35.066
This will allow your body a chance to warm up properly...

00:35.149 --> 00:38.783
...before exerting yourself a little bit more strenuously.

00:39.937 --> 00:42.918
After you run, you might wanna stretch for a couple of minutes.

00:43.023 --> 00:45.605
A lot of runners, they just wanna get in their run...

00:45.825 --> 00:48.186
...and then get dressed, and get to their destination.

00:48.291 --> 00:51.455
However, it's important that you include a couple of stretches afterward,...

00:51.748 --> 00:52.767
...keep your muscles flexible,...

00:52.869 --> 00:55.172
...because running tightens your muscles,...

00:55.325 --> 00:56.378
...keeps your muscles very tight.

00:56.451 --> 00:58.040
So, please stretch after you run.

00:58.447 --> 01:00.501
Also, you wanna make sure that you're properly hydrated...

01:00.588 --> 01:02.025
...before you go out on your run.

01:03.002 --> 01:06.734
It's best to drink about eight ounces of water before your run.

01:06.821 --> 01:09.217
If you can, during and after.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.576
Try to avoid running in the heat of the day,...

01:11.653 --> 01:14.265
...which is generally between 10 am and 2 pm.

01:16.246 --> 01:18.133
You also want to stop running...

01:18.230 --> 01:20.857
...if you feel dizzy, light-headed, nauseous.

01:20.954 --> 01:22.622
Please listen to your body.

01:22.992 --> 01:26.185
If you feel any of those signs, it's best to just stop running.

01:26.270 --> 01:29.355
Runners can be very stubborn, don't be one of those runners.

01:29.459 --> 01:30.470
Every runner is different,...

01:30.537 --> 01:32.545
...but you might wanna consider having a light snack...

01:32.641 --> 01:34.540
...about an hour or two before your run.

01:34.771 --> 01:36.580
I don't recommend eating a heavy meal.

01:36.741 --> 01:39.523
You wanna keep it light, maybe a banana, a piece of fruit,...

01:39.598 --> 01:42.799
...something high in carbohydrates, or something that digests easily.

01:43.748 --> 01:46.485
OK. So, we went over the guidelines, safety,...

01:46.843 --> 01:49.687
...items that you'll need, now it's time to learn how to run.
