So Changmin, have you traveled much around Asia?

00:07.583 --> 00:10.594
Well, a little bit, but not as much as I would have liked to.

00:10.993 --> 00:13.771
Where have you been? Have you ever been to Japan?

00:14.064 --> 00:16.923
I went to Japan once with my family when I was young.

00:17.349 --> 00:18.069
Japan?

00:18.323 --> 00:20.212
I've heard that's a really nice country. 

00:20.578 --> 00:21.945
What city did you go to?

00:22.162 --> 00:23.347
We stayed in Kyoto.

00:23.792 --> 00:25.289
What did you enjoy the most?

00:25.746 --> 00:29.499
It was very clean and we saw a lot of really beautiful palaces.

00:30.105 --> 00:32.613
I also went to Thailand once with some of my friends.

00:32.933 --> 00:33.727
Thailand!

00:33.879 --> 00:34.572
Wow! 

00:34.909 --> 00:36.355
I've always wanted to go there! 

00:36.629 --> 00:37.417
What was it like?

00:37.704 --> 00:39.588
I really had a great time there.
