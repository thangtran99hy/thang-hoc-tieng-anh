00:02.103 --> 00:04.385
Changmin, are you feeling okay today?

00:04.751 --> 00:08.161
To be honest with you, I'm not feeling very well at all.

00:08.794 --> 00:09.597
What's wrong?

00:09.940 --> 00:11.298
I'm not exactly sure.

00:11.677 --> 00:15.614
My throat's been killing me for a couple days and I think I have a fever.

00:16.239 --> 00:17.797
Have you been able to eat at all?

00:18.060 --> 00:21.699
Yes, a little bit, but it really hurts when I swallow.

00:22.171 --> 00:24.473
Something is definitely wrong with my throat.

00:24.825 --> 00:27.705
I think you're right. Why don't you go to the hospital?

00:28.085 --> 00:30.323
I was kind of hoping that I would feel better.

00:30.672 --> 00:32.294
I think you must see a doctor.

00:32.744 --> 00:35.230
But isn't it expensive to see a doctor here?

00:35.512 --> 00:36.995
Not if you are a student.

00:37.294 --> 00:40.488
Changmin, shall we take a break? I think you need a break.
