Hello there. What seems to be the problem today?

00:05.231 --> 00:08.563
Hello, doctor. My throat has been sore for two days.

00:09.049 --> 00:11.552
I see. Do you have a fever as well?

00:11.723 --> 00:14.934
I think so, but I haven't actually taken my temperature.

00:15.425 --> 00:17.021
Have you been able to eat okay?

00:17.297 --> 00:19.199
Are you having any stomach problems?

00:19.517 --> 00:24.109
No, my stomach feels fine now, but I had a stomachache yesterday.

00:24.579 --> 00:27.377
Right. Let me take a look at your throat.

00:27.550 --> 00:29.518
Open up and say "aahhhh" please.

00:29.871 --> 00:32.507
"Aaahhhh." Ouch!

00:32.837 --> 00:35.191
Yes, your throat isn't doing so well.

00:35.523 --> 00:38.638
But don't worry, I will give you some medicine to make it better.

00:38.901 --> 00:41.733
Thank you, doctor. I'm feeling much better already.
