So Changmin, do you play any sports?

00:05.349 --> 00:08.169
When I was young, I really liked to play basketball a lot.

00:08.689 --> 00:09.778
Are you a good player?

00:10.093 --> 00:14.061
I think I used to be pretty good, but I haven't played in a while now.

00:14.531 --> 00:17.681
Can you join our team? Our team needs one more member.

00:18.247 --> 00:21.381
I'll think about it, but I don't know if I'll have much time for that.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.827
Kathy, how about tennis? Do you like to play?

00:25.275 --> 00:28.587
Tennis? Oh no, I was always terrible at tennis.

00:28.865 --> 00:30.861
I like playing table tennis a lot, though.

00:31.172 --> 00:32.301
It is a piece of cake.

00:32.559 --> 00:36.269
I like table tennis, too, although I'm not very good at it.

00:36.815 --> 00:38.543
I bet you're just being modest.
