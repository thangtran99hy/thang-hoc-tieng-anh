00:00.348 --> 00:01.794
Tell me more about your mother.

00:02.381 --> 00:04.805
Well, my mother is very kind and generous.

00:05.214 --> 00:07.695
She's always done so much for me and my brother.

00:08.192 --> 00:11.398
She sounds like a great mother. What about your father?

00:11.711 --> 00:13.224
He has a great personality.

00:13.446 --> 00:16.465
He's very kind, but he is always very busy.

00:16.630 --> 00:17.677
He runs a business.

00:17.971 --> 00:21.313
I see. What about your brother? What is he like?

00:21.537 --> 00:24.935
Oh, he's very easygoing, not like me. We're so different.

00:25.481 --> 00:26.853
He is kind of a troublemaker.

00:27.244 --> 00:28.761
Do you have many cousins?

00:29.053 --> 00:33.485
Yes, I have three cousins on my mother's side, and four on my father's side.

00:33.847 --> 00:34.879
Are you close to them?

00:35.135 --> 00:37.143
Yes, we practically grew up together.
