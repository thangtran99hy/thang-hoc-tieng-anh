Hey, what's up baby sister? How are your classes going?

00:07.704 --> 00:11.720
They're going pretty well. I'm still on schedule to graduate next year.

00:12.340 --> 00:13.290
That's good to hear.

00:14.172 --> 00:19.093
You know, Sherry, I'm sorry to ask you this, but I'm really short of money these days.

00:19.854 --> 00:21.720
Oh? Do you need to borrow some?

00:22.384 --> 00:24.703
Yes, can I borrow some money from you?

00:25.177 --> 00:28.431
Sure, are you still planning to work during the summer break?

00:28.938 --> 00:32.573
Yes, so I can pay you back as soon as I get my first paycheck.

00:33.047 --> 00:36.177
Okay, sounds good. Pay me back after your first check.

00:36.614 --> 00:37.565
How much do you need?
