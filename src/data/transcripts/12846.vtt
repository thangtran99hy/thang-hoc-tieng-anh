This is a really nice place you have, Kathy.

00:04.816 --> 00:07.610
Yes, I really love the way you've decorated it, too.

00:07.979 --> 00:10.359
Thanks guys. I'm glad you like it here.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.839
I hope you can come visit me more often.

00:13.281 --> 00:14.445
You can count on it!

00:14.621 --> 00:18.766
Oops! Oh no! I just dropped my glass on your table.

00:19.203 --> 00:20.641
I'm terribly sorry Kathy.

00:21.167 --> 00:23.683
Hey, don't worry about it. No big deal.

00:23.994 --> 00:27.223
Okay. Uh, Kathy. I hate to tell you this,...

00:27.740 --> 00:30.971
...but I think the glass scratched the table a bit when it fell on it.

00:31.541 --> 00:33.740
I'd like to apologize to you for my mistake.

00:34.111 --> 00:36.305
Oh, that's just a tiny little scratch.

00:36.594 --> 00:39.367
Oh, I'm so sorry. I will pay to get it fixed.

00:39.537 --> 00:40.595
It won't happen again.

00:40.925 --> 00:43.131
No, it's not even worth worrying about.

00:43.387 --> 00:46.304
It's not really your fault, since the glass was slippery.
