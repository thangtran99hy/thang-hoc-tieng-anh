Hey, I've got some big news!

00:04.254 --> 00:05.735
Remember my sister, Sherry?

00:05.907 --> 00:07.870
Sure, of course I remember Sherry.

00:08.176 --> 00:10.971
She and her boyfriend are getting married next month.

00:11.101 --> 00:14.641
Really? That's great! Please congratulate them for me.

00:14.927 --> 00:17.541
Actually, we're hoping that you will do that yourself.

00:17.820 --> 00:19.199
Do you have time this Saturday?

00:19.538 --> 00:21.242
What? What do you mean?

00:21.652 --> 00:23.918
Would you like to join me for the wedding ceremony?

00:24.127 --> 00:24.908
You're kidding me!

00:25.153 --> 00:27.399
Really? I'm invited to the wedding?

00:27.660 --> 00:30.337
Yes, and here is your official invitation.

00:30.577 --> 00:33.344
Wow, Kathy, I'm really honored to be invited.

00:33.893 --> 00:35.502
I'd like to go but I can't.

00:35.769 --> 00:38.779
I am going to my grandfather's birthday party on the same day.
