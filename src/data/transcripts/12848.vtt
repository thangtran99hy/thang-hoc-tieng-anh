00:02.330 --> 00:04.191
Hi, Sherry. Is this your house?

00:04.644 --> 00:06.871
Yes, Changmin, welcome to my home.

00:07.036 --> 00:08.259
It's good to see you again.

00:08.551 --> 00:10.957
It's so nice that you could make it to my wedding.

00:11.087 --> 00:12.645
It's an honor to be here, Sherry.

00:13.096 --> 00:14.250
I'm really happy for you.

00:14.579 --> 00:16.927
Thanks so much. I've got to run now,...

00:17.049 --> 00:19.188
...but my sister can let you know about the schedule.

00:19.322 --> 00:20.583
Okay, sounds good.

00:20.989 --> 00:22.977
Hey, Changmin. Glad you could come.

00:23.295 --> 00:24.155
You're a bit early.

00:24.364 --> 00:26.540
The wedding will begin in about 30 minutes.

00:26.770 --> 00:27.830
Make yourself at home.

00:28.129 --> 00:32.778
Well, I figured if I came early I might be able to say hello to Sherry beforehand.

00:33.042 --> 00:33.861
That's great.

00:34.117 --> 00:37.719
There will be a reception at the Emerald Hotel starting at 3:00 today.

00:38.007 --> 00:39.935
Okay, I'll be there for sure.
