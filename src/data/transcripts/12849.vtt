Hi, Susie. Happy Birthday!

00:04.349 --> 00:08.491
Hi, Changmin. Thank you, I'm so glad you could make it to the party.

00:08.607 --> 00:10.351
Well, I appreciate being invited.

00:10.739 --> 00:12.310
It's a very special day for you.

00:12.566 --> 00:15.813
I know, although I don't like to think that I'm getting older.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.883
Come on, you're still really young.

00:18.128 --> 00:20.002
Well, at least I still feel young.

00:20.351 --> 00:21.728
I'd like to treat you to dinner.

00:21.890 --> 00:22.844
Please help yourself.

00:23.057 --> 00:26.168
Well, Susie. I brought yak-gwa for everyone.

00:26.667 --> 00:28.169
It's a traditional Korean cookie.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.578
It's very delicious. Please try one!

00:30.989 --> 00:33.537
Mmmm, they are delicious!

00:33.919 --> 00:36.505
Let me put them on the table so everyone can try one.

00:37.323 --> 00:39.841
How was dinner? Why don't you have some more?

00:40.026 --> 00:40.889
I've had enough.

00:41.187 --> 00:42.786
It was really delicious.

00:42.927 --> 00:43.412
Thank you.
