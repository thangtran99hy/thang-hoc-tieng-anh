Well guys, I really want to thank you again for this great party.

00:06.342 --> 00:07.857
It was so unexpected.

00:08.252 --> 00:09.287
Come on, Changmin,...

00:09.561 --> 00:13.394
...you didn't think we were going to let you leave without giving you a proper going away...

00:13.495 --> 00:14.340
...party, did you?

00:14.802 --> 00:17.366
We're all really going to miss you a lot, Changmin.

00:17.901 --> 00:20.671
Yeah, it won't be the same without you here!

00:21.122 --> 00:23.726
I'm really going to miss all of you guys a lot, too.

00:24.331 --> 00:27.018
You've made my stay here in the U.S. very special.

00:27.427 --> 00:29.390
Please stay for 30 more minutes.

00:29.564 --> 00:31.730
Unfortunately, I've got to get going now.

00:32.099 --> 00:33.341
It's time to say goodbye.

00:33.719 --> 00:35.733
Just be sure to keep in touch, okay?

00:36.141 --> 00:37.559
I will, I promise.

00:38.081 --> 00:40.703
Take care, Changmin. Have a safe trip home!

00:41.053 --> 00:42.646
Thank you for everything you've done.

00:42.901 --> 00:43.931
Bye everyone!
