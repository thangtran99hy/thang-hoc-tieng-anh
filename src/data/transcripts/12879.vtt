00:02.946 --> 00:04.999
US facing Japan, both teams,...

00:05.147 --> 00:06.779
...but misses, that would be costly.

00:06.929 --> 00:08.095
2nd half still scoreless.

00:08.255 --> 00:12.122
Alex Morgan, in front.

00:12.607 --> 00:14.200
That won't go in.

00:14.779 --> 00:18.633
The ball is clear. Take another look, the ball hits the post. Homare Sawa...

00:19.458 --> 00:27.371
...clears it away as Japan once again just getting out of the way.

00:27.495 --> 00:28.279
68th minute.

00:28.369 --> 00:32.730
Ripino to Morgan, the 22 - year old from Diamond Bar, California,...

00:32.975 --> 00:37.079
...a sub in this game, puts it in the back of the net and the US takes the lead.

00:37.329 --> 00:37.938
80th minute.

00:39.181 --> 00:42.420
Rachel Buehler, stopped in front, finds Alice Krieger.

00:44.279 --> 00:45.040
Can't get it out.

00:45.165 --> 00:48.299
And Aya Miyama scores for Japan...

00:49.842 --> 00:52.691
...as Hope Solo goes the wrong way and we are tied at 1.

00:52.767 --> 00:54.609
Take a couple more looks at this. Miyama,...
