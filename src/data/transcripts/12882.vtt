It's true what they say and I didn't believe it until it happened to me,...

00:03.160 --> 00:04.639
...but money can't buy happiness.

00:05.543 --> 00:07.627
He said, "No, but it can buy Prozac."

00:09.237 --> 00:10.673
And he put me on antidepressants.

00:10.992 --> 00:14.763
And the black cloud faded a little bit. But so did all the work.

00:15.171 --> 00:18.601
Because I was just floating along, I couldn't care less if clients ever called.

00:21.684 --> 00:23.083
And clients didn't call.

00:24.498 --> 00:27.608
Because they could see I was no longer serving them, I was only serving myself.

00:28.452 --> 00:31.482
So, they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better.

00:32.196 --> 00:35.205
Well, it didn't take long for business to drop like a rock.

00:35.968 --> 00:39.711
My partner and I, Thom, we had to let all our employees go.

00:39.819 --> 00:42.129
It was down to just the two of us, and we were about to go under.

00:42.728 --> 00:43.590
And that was great.

00:44.210 --> 00:47.048
Because with no employees, there was nobody for me to manage.

00:48.136 --> 00:50.197
So, I went back to doing the projects I loved.

00:51.081 --> 00:54.336
I had fun again. I worked harder. And to cut the long story short,...

00:54.781 --> 00:57.169
...did all the things that took me back up to success.

00:58.273 --> 01:01.247
But it wasn't a quick trip. It took seven years.

01:01.717 --> 01:04.499
But in the end, business grew bigger than ever.

01:05.207 --> 01:07.397
And when I went back to following these eight principles,...

01:07.943 --> 01:10.320
...the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether.

01:10.626 --> 01:14.092
And I woke up one day and I said, "I don't need Prozac anymore."

01:14.510 --> 01:16.656
And I threw it away and haven't needed it since.

01:17.121 --> 01:19.090
I learned that success isn't a one-way street.

01:19.653 --> 01:22.561
It doesn't look like this. It really looks more like this.

01:22.835 --> 01:27.609
It's a continuous journey. And if we want to avoid "success to failure syndrome",...

01:28.061 --> 01:29.996
...we just keep following these eight principles.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.264
Because that's not only how we achieve success,...

01:32.591 --> 01:33.608
...it's how we sustain it.

01:34.627 --> 01:37.687
So, here's to your continued success. Thank you very much.
