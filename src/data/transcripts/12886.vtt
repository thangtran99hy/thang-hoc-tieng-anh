Thank you. I'm honored to be with you today for your commencement...

00:29.940 --> 00:31.951
...from one of the finest universities in the world.

00:35.734 --> 00:40.164
Truth be told, I never graduated from college,...

00:40.999 --> 00:45.123
...and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.

00:47.851 --> 00:50.649
Today, I want to tell you three stories from my life.

00:51.139 --> 00:54.078
That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.776
The first story is about connecting the dots.

01:00.598 --> 01:03.657
I dropped out of Reed College after the first six months,...

01:03.873 --> 01:07.742
... but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit.

01:09.185 --> 01:10.262
So why did I drop out?

01:12.114 --> 01:13.538
It started before I was born.

01:15.119 --> 01:18.653
My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student...

01:19.103 --> 01:20.959
...and she decided to put me up for adoption.

01:22.161 --> 01:25.639
She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates.

01:25.999 --> 01:30.336
So everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife...

01:31.599 --> 01:33.002
...except that when I popped out,...

01:33.477 --> 01:36.135
...they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.

01:37.669 --> 01:42.183
So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking,...

01:43.147 --> 01:48.747
..."We've got an unexpected baby boy. Do you want him?" They said, "Of course."

01:50.626 --> 01:55.156
My biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college...

01:55.737 --> 01:57.909
...and that my father had never graduated from high school.

01:58.876 --> 02:01.663
She refused to sign the final adoption papers.

02:03.181 --> 02:08.149
She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college.

02:09.162 --> 02:11.297
This was the start in my life.

02:13.689 --> 02:16.410
And 17 years later, I did go to college.

02:17.374 --> 02:21.168
But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford...

02:22.267 --> 02:26.233
...and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition.

02:27.310 --> 02:29.788
After six months, I couldn't see the value in it.

02:30.556 --> 02:32.680
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life...

02:33.246 --> 02:35.823
... and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.

02:36.655 --> 02:40.457
And here I was, spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life.

02:42.374 --> 02:46.309
So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay.

02:47.380 --> 02:49.693
It was pretty scary at the time but looking back,...

02:50.139 --> 02:51.927
...it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

02:53.840 --> 02:58.933
The minute I dropped out, I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me...

02:59.511 --> 03:03.065
...and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.
