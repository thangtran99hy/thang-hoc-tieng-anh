Jimmy Wales is the founder of Wikipedia,...

00:05.823 --> 00:08.291
...the largest and most popular encyclopedia on the planet.

00:09.141 --> 00:11.797
He's also a card-carrying believer in Internet freedom.

00:12.571 --> 00:14.829
Here, he is explaining exactly what that means.

00:15.469 --> 00:17.844
So 20 years ago, if I wanted to know something,...

00:17.928 --> 00:20.681
...I would have to buy a set of encyclopedias...

00:20.814 --> 00:22.285
...the size of a concrete block.

00:22.555 --> 00:23.657
One hundred years ago,...

00:23.720 --> 00:27.274
...I would have had to borrow the books because it'd be too expensive...

00:27.429 --> 00:29.003
...for most people to buy.

00:29.769 --> 00:32.271
Five hundred years ago, I would have had to borrow a book...

00:32.492 --> 00:34.482
...from a priest or a lord or just go and ask them...

00:34.613 --> 00:38.993
...because they're the only people who had books and most people didn't even know how to read.

00:39.551 --> 00:41.136
The Internet has changed all this forever.

00:41.513 --> 00:43.747
Of course now, we have information on demand.

00:44.059 --> 00:47.366
And it's not just one-way traffic, I can publish my thoughts online...

00:47.489 --> 00:48.852
...for anyone that's interested to read.

00:49.461 --> 00:51.567
It becomes so normal that we take all this freedom for granted.

00:51.903 --> 00:55.689
Today, there are over two billion people connected to the Internet...

00:55.862 --> 00:58.100
...but a third of them are living in an information Dark Age...

00:58.334 --> 01:02.303
...because some leaders censor information as too troublesome for ordinary people to see.

01:02.801 --> 01:06.160
Chunks of history are being removed, websites are being rubbed out...

01:06.781 --> 01:09.295
...and people are being punished for talking freely online.

01:09.933 --> 01:12.497
Internet should be a force for freedom, not repression.

01:12.956 --> 01:15.860
Ordinary people should be in control of the content they view...

01:16.343 --> 01:18.220
...and they should do it without fear of being punished.

01:18.947 --> 01:20.303
Internet repression is spreading.

01:20.509 --> 01:22.364
The world faces the danger of two Internets,...

01:22.788 --> 01:25.955
...one for the free exchange of ideas and another for oppression.

01:26.386 --> 01:28.981
It undermines the very principle on which the Internet was founded.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.984
The Internet is freedom of information.

01:31.305 --> 01:33.100
And the Internet is bigger than newspapers,...

01:33.186 --> 01:36.054
...it's bigger than radio, it's even bigger than television...

01:36.186 --> 01:38.627
...which is why we can never allow governments to take control.

01:38.844 --> 01:41.375
The Internet was founded on the principle of freedom.

01:41.580 --> 01:44.731
The definition is the right to act, speak or think as we want...

01:44.993 --> 01:46.993
...without hindrance and without restraint.
