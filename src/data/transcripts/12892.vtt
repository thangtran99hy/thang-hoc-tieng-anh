We caught up with Miranda Kerr at the Victoria's Secret event at the Mondrian Hotel...

00:07.129 --> 00:09.038
...and found out what's inside her beach bag...

00:09.334 --> 00:11.189
...and how to be a bombshell just like her.

00:11.777 --> 00:12.836
And what are you wearing today?

00:12.894 --> 00:13.623
Balenciaga.

00:16.529 --> 00:18.219
So, what do you always have in your beach bag?

00:19.089 --> 00:23.020
Well in my beach bag, I have a swimsuit from Victoria's Secret.

00:23.083 --> 00:25.988
I like, you know, the little string bikini.

00:26.169 --> 00:29.559
I also think another great shape for this season is the miraculous push up.

00:29.939 --> 00:30.488
Have you seen that?

00:30.567 --> 00:31.142
I have not.

00:31.291 --> 00:33.390
It gives you like an hourglass figure.

00:33.606 --> 00:37.573
And obviously a towel and my iPod and some sunscreen and...

00:38.150 --> 00:40.182
...a little bit of shimmer, a bit of bronzer.

00:40.716 --> 00:42.077
What's your summer style secret?

00:42.941 --> 00:45.117
You know, make sure you're comfortable...

00:45.379 --> 00:46.753
...because if you're comfortable then...

00:47.029 --> 00:49.673
...you're gonna exude that kind of confidence.

00:49.817 --> 00:52.763
How do you incorporate that bombshell attitude into your everyday style?

00:53.851 --> 00:58.560
I think being a bombshell is an attitude and it's like an inner confidence,...

00:58.713 --> 01:02.814
...and I think that everyone is sexy and beautiful in their own way and they can really,...

01:02.916 --> 01:04.963
...if they believe that then they can really exude that.

01:05.405 --> 01:08.290
So make sure to keep all of Miranda's tips in mind for summer.

01:08.636 --> 01:10.903
