00:00.653 --> 00:05.102
From the rainforests of South America to the classrooms of our inner cities,...

00:05.345 --> 00:07.394
...from the purple mountain's majesty...

00:07.505 --> 00:10.860
...to the fruity plain with amber waves of whatever,...

00:10.980 --> 00:13.056
...we could fight to make the world a better place...

00:13.266 --> 00:16.013
...if we only knew why. Think about it.

00:16.630 --> 00:18.807
What do animals do except poop on your lawn...

00:18.824 --> 00:20.939
...and make you feel guilty about how delicious they are?

00:21.377 --> 00:24.116
Why should children be burdened by the tyranny of reading?

00:24.537 --> 00:25.392
Words are hard!

00:26.071 --> 00:26.610
The arts,...

00:27.325 --> 00:28.294
...they don't need your support.

00:28.645 --> 00:30.530
What artists do need is soap.

00:30.711 --> 00:32.899
Seriously, the next time you meet an artist, smell him.

00:33.142 --> 00:35.001
I swear they rub their armpits with onions.

00:35.201 --> 00:37.670
People are always saying, "Get involved."

00:37.899 --> 00:39.239
Well, to them I say, "Sure."

00:39.375 --> 00:40.047
"I'll take a stand."

00:40.757 --> 00:43.209
"For as long as it takes me to find a comfy chair."

00:45.415 --> 00:46.413
That feels good.
