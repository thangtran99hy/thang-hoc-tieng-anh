Welcome to tips and techniques at startcooking.com.

I'm Kathy Meister.

00:04.871 --> 00:08.197
There are six rules you need to follow to make perfect pasta.

00:08.601 --> 00:10.667
Number one: Use a really big pot.

00:11.236 --> 00:13.804
Otherwise, all the pasta will stick together when you cook it.

00:14.439 --> 00:16.655
Number two: Boil lots of water.

00:16.997 --> 00:19.201
At least four quarts for one pound of pasta.

00:19.651 --> 00:20.846
Be sure to cover the pot...

00:21.209 --> 00:23.163
...so the water comes to a boil more quickly.

00:23.760 --> 00:26.721
Number three: Add two tablespoons of salt to the pot...

00:27.248 --> 00:28.791
...after the water comes to a boil.

00:29.537 --> 00:33.805
Number four: Put in your pasta and bring the pot back to a boil.

00:34.534 --> 00:37.371
Number five: Be sure to give it an occasional stir.

00:37.973 --> 00:43.017
And number six: Cook the pasta uncovered for no longer than it says on the package.

00:43.763 --> 00:45.394
Give it a taste to see if it's tender.

00:46.015 --> 00:49.149
Now, carefully, lift the pot with some potholders...

00:49.330 --> 00:50.797
...and drain the pasta in the sink.

00:51.390 --> 00:52.555
Don't forget the colander.

00:53.135 --> 00:53.637
That's it.

00:53.929 --> 00:56.397
Just add your favorite sauce and enjoy!
