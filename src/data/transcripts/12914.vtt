00:00.035 --> 00:00.937
The Country.

00:02.054 --> 00:06.140
I wondered about you when you told me never to leave...

00:06.265 --> 00:09.239
...a box of wooden, strike - anywhere matches...

00:09.593 --> 00:12.722
...just lying around the house because the mice...

00:12.814 --> 00:15.193
...might get into them and start a fire.

00:16.143 --> 00:18.816
But your face was absolutely straight...

00:19.197 --> 00:22.625
...when you twisted the lid down on the round tin...

00:22.963 --> 00:25.997
...where the matches, you said, are always stowed.

00:26.431 --> 00:28.249
Who could sleep that night?

00:28.800 --> 00:32.818
Who could whisk away the thought of the one unlikely mouse...

00:33.227 --> 00:37.743
...padding along a cold water pipe behind the floral wallpaper,...

00:38.060 --> 00:42.273
...gripping a single wooden match between the needles of his teeth?

00:42.919 --> 00:45.418
Who could not see him rounding a corner,...

00:45.825 --> 00:49.223
...the blue tip scratching against a rough-hewn beam,...

00:49.710 --> 00:54.666
...the sudden flare, and the creature for one bright, shining moment...

00:54.993 --> 01:00.707
...suddenly thrust ahead of his time -- now a fire - starter, now a torchbearer...

01:00.939 --> 01:06.786
...in a forgotten ritual, little brown druid illuminating some ancient night.

01:07.623 --> 01:12.134
And who could fail to notice, lit up in the blazing insulation,...

01:12.567 --> 01:18.559
...the tiny looks of wonderment on the faces of his fellow mice, one time inhabitants...

01:18.897 --> 01:22.635
...of what once was your house in the country?
