Hey! This is Scott from Google.

00:02.017 --> 00:04.884
We're here in Times Square New York to find out what is a browser.

00:05.622 --> 00:08.403
A website that you can search on, I think.

00:08.573 --> 00:11.441
I call it a search engine that's why I call it the browser.

00:11.720 --> 00:12.720
What is a browser?

00:15.595 --> 00:16.833
Browser is a search engine.

00:17.593 --> 00:17.924
Browser?

00:18.275 --> 00:20.646
Is a search engine. Browse what?

00:21.191 --> 00:23.915
It's where I search through, like to find things.

00:24.361 --> 00:24.765
What's that?

00:25.993 --> 00:28.304
It's where you put your search terms. Correct?

00:28.553 --> 00:29.339
What is a browser?

00:30.843 --> 00:33.321
Google, what else?

00:34.369 --> 00:37.377
A browser is what you use to look at the Internet web pages.

00:37.894 --> 00:38.594
What is a browser?

00:38.652 --> 00:39.145
What is a browser?

00:39.447 --> 00:41.453
I use Yahoo! No, it's not in our browser.

00:41.989 --> 00:44.801
Do you know what's the difference between a search engine and a browser?

00:46.025 --> 00:48.290
Well, not exactly. I mean, no.

00:48.810 --> 00:49.442
I don't know.

00:49.561 --> 00:51.849
 I guess the Internet is just where you, you know,...

00:52.028 --> 00:55.188
...find anything and I guess you browse the same way.

00:55.289 --> 00:56.064
Hell, I don't know.

00:57.343 --> 00:59.566
A browser is when you know what you're looking for...

00:59.628 --> 01:02.535
...and a search engine is  when you're searching for something.

01:02.925 --> 01:07.770
I see my browsers the way they get on but ah; no, I don't know much.

01:07.974 --> 01:11.506
So, do you know what's the difference between Google and your browser?

01:13.542 --> 01:14.425
No, not really.

01:15.864 --> 01:16.745
What browser do you use?

01:17.023 --> 01:18.335
I use Firefox.

01:18.883 --> 01:20.443
What made you use Mozilla Firefox?

01:20.657 --> 01:23.515
My friend came over to my house and erased all my other browsers...

01:23.611 --> 01:25.111
...and installed it and said you're using this now.

01:25.572 --> 01:26.768
What browser do you guys use?

01:27.211 --> 01:27.629
Google.

01:28.078 --> 01:31.563
I have AOL. We go through broadband.

01:32.549 --> 01:38.214
The big E with the Explorer. I'm not a computer guy. I might be the wrong one for this.

01:38.827 --> 01:40.313
What browser do you guys like to use?

01:41.031 --> 01:41.559
We use Google.

01:43.045 --> 01:44.096
I use Google.

01:44.890 --> 01:47.511
Google predominates the market obviously...

01:47.653 --> 01:50.551
...but occasionally, I like to go to Yahoo just to get in some business.

01:51.240 --> 01:55.565
Yeah, I use Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox.

01:56.225 --> 02:01.291
Oh! Is that your Internet browser? Help!

02:02.120 --> 02:03.946
Have you heard of Google's browser Chrome?

02:04.660 --> 02:05.779
No, I haven't. No.

02:06.287 --> 02:08.567
C - H - R - O - M - E? No.

02:09.889 --> 02:10.297
What is that?

02:11.220 --> 02:11.607
Crown?

02:11.848 --> 02:12.033
Chrome.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.455
No, I have not.

02:14.032 --> 02:16.029
Have you heard of Google's Chrome browser?

02:16.113 --> 02:17.642
No. Should I use it?

02:18.439 --> 02:20.445
Have you heard of Google's Chrome browser?

02:21.077 --> 02:25.463
Chrome browser? No way!
