00:00.407 --> 00:08.779
I was eighteen years old in Korean age when I first left my country to study English.

00:10.472 --> 00:17.178
When I first got there, I was with my dad so I felt very, kinda safe...

00:17.361 --> 00:23.340
...even though I couldn't speak English. But after one week, my dad left.

00:23.676 --> 00:30.731
I was all alone and I couldn't speak English. I was just very afraid.

00:31.112 --> 00:33.735
There are two reasons why I went to Canada.

00:34.251 --> 00:37.035
The first reason was just to learn English.

00:37.191 --> 00:45.375
The second reason, to be more honest, I wanted to get out of the pressure...

00:46.217 --> 00:50.561
...that I had to get into a good university in Korea.

00:50.908 --> 00:54.776
Like the Su-neung exam, I didn't want to take it.

00:55.188 --> 00:57.992
That was the more honest reason.

01:03.956 --> 01:08.434
I think it was for six months that I had really hard time.

01:08.719 --> 01:11.830
I always had to carry my dictionary with me,...

01:12.061 --> 01:16.805
...so I can search words that I had to speak at that moment.

01:17.410 --> 01:29.605
After 6 months, I started to be able to listen to what the teachers were saying.

01:29.751 --> 01:35.347
I made a lot of friends, a lot of Canadian friends after 6 months.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.779
So, that helped a lot.

01:38.491 --> 01:41.357
They tried to talk to me all the time.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.437
They thought I was interesting.

01:43.641 --> 01:45.072
I was from Korea.

01:45.230 --> 01:52.205
I repeated everything that they said, so they thought maybe I was cute.

01:52.655 --> 01:57.082
They would want to talk to me more.

01:57.550 --> 02:01.157
I was in Canada for three and a half years.
