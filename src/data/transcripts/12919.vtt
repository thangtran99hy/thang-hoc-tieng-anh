The female body, amazing in its own way, not as strong or as fast as the male body...

00:12.655 --> 00:16.282
...but it still works for cooking, cleaning and collecting firewood.

00:16.825 --> 00:20.257
The female's brain is about the same size as the male brain...

00:20.497 --> 00:23.138
...but it is not equipped with the math skills needed...

00:23.259 --> 00:25.438
...to beat world records or keep score,...

00:26.173 --> 00:27.734
...which is why women use calculators.

00:28.938 --> 00:32.820
From a psychological view, the female mind is conditioned from an early age...

00:32.934 --> 00:33.955
...to know her place.

00:34.359 --> 00:38.223
A lack of female athletes and coaches helps reinforce this conditioning.

00:38.843 --> 00:43.834
Their weak minds match their weak bodies so more sports scholarships are given to boys.

00:44.336 --> 00:48.535
Women are ruled by hormones, which is why they sometimes gather and try to play games.

00:49.014 --> 00:52.426
And although they have the same sweat glands as their male counterparts,...

00:52.693 --> 00:55.163
...their glands should never actually produce sweat.

00:56.403 --> 01:00.419
The female body is built to have babies, lots and lots of babies.

01:00.692 --> 01:03.275
So every month, girls experience their menstrual cycle.

01:03.786 --> 01:07.927
At this time, they must be kept inside lest they attract bears.

01:08.519 --> 01:13.411
Giving girls their own playing fields is potentially deadly and should be avoided.

01:13.913 --> 01:16.435
Even riding a bike might cause feminine damage.

01:16.904 --> 01:21.742
For her own protection, she should walk but never alone or at night.

01:22.707 --> 01:26.469
So as you can see, the female body is most efficient at rest.

01:26.858 --> 01:29.495
Any rigorous physical activity might cause breakage,...

01:29.707 --> 01:32.241
...internal bleeding or long bouts of crying,...

01:32.673 --> 01:35.835
...which is why women should never play sports.

01:36.352 --> 01:37.862
That's biology folks!

01:38.267 --> 01:40.557
There's nothing we can do about it.

01:42.357 --> 01:46.745
Beat the inequality, stereotypes, unfair pay, myths, mistreatment, absurdity, stupidity.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.016
Beat the BS.
