Jet lag.

00:11.549 --> 00:15.172
Well, it's time to wake up and learn a little bit about jet lag.

00:15.767 --> 00:19.539
Over 90% of people who travel through three time zones...

00:19.737 --> 00:22.795
...experience symptoms of jet lag which include...

00:22.867 --> 00:31.123
...insomnia, fatigue, constipation, poor concentration, irritability and depression.

00:31.479 --> 00:35.027
There is no treatment and recovery may take up to two weeks.

00:35.429 --> 00:37.823
But here are some tips for minimizing its effect.

00:38.477 --> 00:43.517
If flying from east to west, exercise in the sunlight in the late afternoon.

00:44.065 --> 00:48.579
If flying from west to east, exercise in the sun in the mid-morning.

00:49.548 --> 00:52.355
Talk to a physician about using a mild sleeping aid...

00:52.479 --> 00:55.290
...such as Ambien or Sonata...

00:55.663 --> 00:59.209
...if you are taking a red-eye flight from west to east.

00:59.941 --> 01:04.868
Over-the-counter antihistamine such as Benadryl have also been used with some success.

01:05.665 --> 01:11.355
My personal favorite is melatonin, which is a naturally occurring hormone...

01:11.693 --> 01:15.634
...that's been linked to the control of the human circadian rhythm.

01:16.345 --> 01:18.774
Dosage varies from 2 to 5 milligrams...

01:18.836 --> 01:23.022
...taken about 30 minutes before normal bedtime on the day of travel,...

01:23.488 --> 01:29.691
...and then 1/2 a milligram each day for 4 days after arrival at your destination.

01:30.521 --> 01:33.714
Other recommendations include drinking lots of fluids,...

01:34.005 --> 01:37.949
...reserving a window seat, watching a boring movie or...

01:38.118 --> 01:41.408
...enjoying a spa or massage treatment after arrival.
