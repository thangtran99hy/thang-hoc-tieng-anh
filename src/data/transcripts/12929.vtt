Thank you Toby for sharing your story with us here today.

00:07.385 --> 00:11.402
Toby's story highlights what Pyeongchang 2018 is really all about.

00:12.040 --> 00:14.713
It's about giving people with desire and talent...

00:15.091 --> 00:18.231
...the tools they need to excel and succeed.

00:19.049 --> 00:23.459
It's about expanding the potential of winter sport in underserved markets.

00:24.727 --> 00:30.949
And New Horizons is ultimately about what the Olympic movement uniquely provides to the world.

00:31.379 --> 00:35.045
Potential, opportunity and hope.

00:36.277 --> 00:41.221
Some have said that this is a contest between the roots of traditional winter sports...

00:41.391 --> 00:43.136
...and the new shores of opportunity.

00:44.181 --> 00:47.200
Some have said that the Winter Games need to return...

00:47.481 --> 00:50.016
...to their traditional markets to be replenished.

00:51.191 --> 00:55.891
Actually, of the 21 Winter Games held so far since 1924,...

00:56.217 --> 00:59.867
...19 have been held in traditional winter sports markets.

01:00.116 --> 01:02.264
And only 2 have been held in Asia.

01:02.652 --> 01:04.305
And none in Korea.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.669
So, if any region needs replenishment,...

01:08.120 --> 01:11.445
...we humbly propose that we need the Winter Games in Asia...

01:11.974 --> 01:16.212
...to nurture the seeds that were planted in Sapporo and in Nagano...

01:16.476 --> 01:19.110
...so that they too can grow and flourish.

01:20.475 --> 01:22.618
But this race is not about geography.

01:24.025 --> 01:26.169
It is a race about dreams.

01:27.368 --> 01:29.992
It is a race about human potential.

01:31.297 --> 01:33.002
I would now like to speak in French.

01:37.249 --> 01:41.412
Through the beauty of sport, the Olympic movement has the unique power...

01:41.882 --> 01:44.668
...to inspire social, economic...

01:45.661 --> 01:49.443
...and sometimes, even ideological change.

01:50.601 --> 01:55.477
Korea experienced this unique power firsthand in 1988.

01:56.012 --> 02:01.522
And for over 10 years, we've nurtured the dream of sharing that experience with others...

02:02.149 --> 02:04.199
...who have not had the opportunity.

02:05.284 --> 02:10.301
We've already set in motion a change of positive and profound changes...

02:10.874 --> 02:13.619
...for our people and the region around us.

02:15.957 --> 02:20.608
The considerable level of our investments...

02:20.895 --> 02:26.685
...is being made in advancing the performance of elite Winter Olympic and Paralympic athletes.

02:28.193 --> 02:33.557
And new sporting heroes can be expected...

02:36.532 --> 02:37.890
...such as Yu-na Kim.

02:38.356 --> 02:41.201
They are inspiring youngsters of the entire world...

02:41.292 --> 02:46.572
...to pursue excellence and physical activities wherever they may live.

02:47.199 --> 02:48.901
And now, I will continue in English.
