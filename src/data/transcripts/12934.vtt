Pyeongchang has been consistently building winter sports facilities...

00:04.093 --> 00:07.487
...and nurturing young athletes like Yu-na to achieve their best,...

00:08.731 --> 00:10.364
...all with the single goal in mind:...

00:11.025 --> 00:14.126
...to host an Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.

00:15.310 --> 00:17.199
"New Horizons" has a simple goal:...

00:17.671 --> 00:23.523
...to give young Koreans and young athletes access to world-class sports facilities for the first time,...

00:24.132 --> 00:26.917
..the same chance that I was fortunate to receive in America.

00:28.561 --> 00:30.074
That's what this bid is all about:...

00:30.722 --> 00:31.794
...it's about hope.

00:32.656 --> 00:34.104
So you may ask yourself,...

00:34.560 --> 00:36.331
..."To whom are we listening to today?"

00:37.099 --> 00:39.546
"To Toby Dawson, the American olympian..."

00:40.256 --> 00:45.407
"...or to Kim Bong-seok, the little Korean boy with the ability to be an Olympian..."

00:45.779 --> 00:47.993
"...with limited resources to do so?"

00:48.653 --> 00:51.257
Well to be honest, you're listening to both.

00:51.811 --> 00:54.453
I came here today to achieve two things.

00:54.981 --> 00:59.717
First, I want to honor my home country and its people, my people.

01:00.214 --> 01:02.632
I want to return some small measure,...

01:02.885 --> 01:05.917
...the good fortune that I received in life from sport.

01:07.353 --> 01:11.671
And second, I want to speak for future generations in Korea and beyond.

01:12.369 --> 01:14.533
I ask you to give them the same chance...

01:14.833 --> 01:18.325
...that I was so fortunate to receive in America in 1981:...

01:19.248 --> 01:23.901
...the chance to participate, the chance to excel, and the chance to succeed.

01:25.053 --> 01:27.601
Your support today of Pyeongchang 2018...

01:27.996 --> 01:30.762
...would truly change the lives of millions of kids...

01:31.000 --> 01:33.600
...who haven't had the opportunity to be an Olympian.

01:34.289 --> 01:36.511
I believe that there is no greater honor...

01:36.889 --> 01:39.723
...than representing one's country at the Olympic Games.

01:40.523 --> 01:43.020
It is my dream that every child...

01:43.539 --> 01:46.764
...everywhere in the world can hope for that possibility.

01:48.597 --> 01:52.631
Thank you members of the IOC for all that you do every day...

01:52.822 --> 01:53.994
...to make dreams come true.

01:54.674 --> 01:59.558
And thank you for the promise of hope that the Olympic values provide to us all.
