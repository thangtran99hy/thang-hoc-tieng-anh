00:01.427 --> 00:05.598
The 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang will leave a unique...

00:05.882 --> 00:08.370
...and lasting legacy for generations to come.

00:09.307 --> 00:10.461
Every Games does.

00:11.547 --> 00:14.347
But ours will be a legacy beyond bricks and mortar.

00:15.024 --> 00:18.981
A legacy beyond potential world records and gold medals.

00:19.325 --> 00:24.062
Ours is a legacy that creates opportunity and potential for young people,...

00:24.667 --> 00:27.799
...wherever they may be and for whatever they may dream.

00:29.607 --> 00:34.281
Today is one of the most important days in the lives of every member of our team.

00:35.409 --> 00:40.838
Although I will admit, the memory of this day will be a lot sweeter if you choose Pyeongchang.

00:42.277 --> 00:44.705
It is an honor to represent our country.

00:46.003 --> 00:47.507
But perhaps even more poignant,...

00:48.361 --> 00:49.881
...it is an honor to have the chance...

00:50.090 --> 00:53.972
...to impact the millions of young people in the future.

00:55.729 --> 00:59.480
That is something that only the Olympic movement can provide to us.

01:01.057 --> 01:05.197
And that is something that only Pyeongchang 2018 can provide to you today.

01:06.497 --> 01:09.599
We know that whatever decision you make today will be a historic one.

01:10.620 --> 01:14.781
Uniquely, Pyeongchang 2018 offers you both a historic choice...

01:15.241 --> 01:19.899
...and a historic chance to bring the Winter Games to Korea for the first time...

01:20.404 --> 01:23.041
...and back to Asia for only the third time.

01:23.993 --> 01:29.447
And in doing so, help us to deliver the potential, the promise,...

01:30.327 --> 01:38.170
...and yes, the hope of Pyeongchang 2018 to millions of new hearts and minds around the world.

01:39.970 --> 01:42.239
Thank you very much for your attention this afternoon...

01:42.594 --> 01:47.803
... and for the honor of participating in this campaign for the 2018 Winter Games.

01:48.910 --> 01:54.815
And now, in our last film, several of our Dream program children will share with you,...

01:55.569 --> 02:00.505
...perhaps better than anyone can, what "new horizons" truly means.
