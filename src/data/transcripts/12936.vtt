00:00.805 --> 00:04.815
President Rogge, members of the IOC, good afternoon.

00:05.818 --> 00:10.113
It's hard to believe it's only been seven weeks since we met in Lausanne.

00:10.959 --> 00:13.983
Since that time, I've been training harder for today...

00:14.379 --> 00:16.638
...than for most of my competitions.

00:17.357 --> 00:19.165
And just like in Lausanne,...

00:19.579 --> 00:21.389
...I'm still a little bit nervous.

00:22.837 --> 00:25.268
After all, to be part of this process,...

00:25.432 --> 00:27.669
...it's very humbling for someone my age.

00:28.490 --> 00:32.652
It is humbling because you are making history today.

00:33.192 --> 00:35.303
And I get to be a small part of it.

00:36.828 --> 00:40.332
I remember feeling the same way when I competed in Vancouver.

00:41.258 --> 00:45.237
Ten years ago, when Pyeongchang began its dream to host the Winter Games,...

00:45.702 --> 00:50.547
...I was a young girl beginning my own Olympic dream in an ice rink in Seoul.

00:51.935 --> 00:55.123
At the time, I was fortunate to choose a winter sport...

00:55.345 --> 00:59.084
...that had good training facilities and coaches in Korea.

01:00.137 --> 01:04.497
But as you know, many Korean winter athletes travel halfway around the world...

01:05.003 --> 01:07.378
...just to train for their Olympic dreams.

01:08.291 --> 01:12.337
But now, my dream is to share the opportunities I had...

01:12.773 --> 01:14.726
...with other athletes in new regions.

01:15.876 --> 01:19.166
And Pyeongchang 2018 can help achieve that.

01:20.893 --> 01:23.862
Our government created the "Drive the Dream" project...

01:24.124 --> 01:28.213
...to fund winter sports facilities and training for athletes.

01:29.231 --> 01:30.543
Thanks to this program,...

01:31.081 --> 01:35.081
... Korea earned a total of 14 medals in Vancouver, including mine.

01:36.303 --> 01:40.864
And we placed 7th in overall medals won out of 82 countries.

01:42.191 --> 01:43.599
To do even better in the future,...

01:43.891 --> 01:48.301
...we need the new venues that Pyeongchang 2018 will bring.

01:49.805 --> 01:55.059
With "New Horizons", we'll leave a legacy that is perhaps even more important than venues.

01:55.905 --> 01:58.025
I'm talking about human legacy.

01:59.031 --> 02:01.103
I'm an example of a living legacy...

02:01.484 --> 02:06.043
...of our government's effort to improve the standards of Korean winter sports.

02:07.219 --> 02:13.259
And I know now, perhaps more than I ever imagined, what our victory would mean.

02:14.383 --> 02:17.947
It will mean the possibility for success and achievement.

02:18.927 --> 02:23.877
That's what young people everywhere in the world need and deserve.

02:25.553 --> 02:29.132
And lastly, I would like to add a personal note to you today.

02:30.059 --> 02:33.075
It's rare for an Olympian to actually get to say,...

02:33.867 --> 02:37.189
..."Thank you to all IOC members" at one time.

02:37.926 --> 02:40.126
So please allow me to say...

02:40.761 --> 02:45.465
...thank you, dear IOC members for providing someone like me the opportunity...

02:45.785 --> 02:49.419
...to achieve my dreams and to inspire others.
