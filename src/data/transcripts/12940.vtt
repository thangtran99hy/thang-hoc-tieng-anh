What kind of games and things do you play with them and make up with them?

00:08.831 --> 00:15.228
I have an elaborate... it's a lexicon of games that I have invented.

00:15.490 --> 00:19.484
One of 'em is called "The Choo Choo Coming Through," which is you kinda sit on a chair...

00:20.009 --> 00:25.391
...and they crawl under your legs and you stop them before they get out and ask them a question.

00:25.979 --> 00:29.367
And they have to answer the question. Then if they answer the question, you go, "OK, go ahead."

00:31.555 --> 00:37.380
I mean obviously, kids like grown-ups, sadly, are very amused by body function...

00:37.999 --> 00:39.376
...references of any kind.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.317
You know, two kids were in my closet...

00:43.061 --> 00:46.030
...last night naked and they were sitting on my garment bag.

00:46.821 --> 00:51.637
And I said, "Don't get your butt crack juice on my garment bag!"

00:53.737 --> 00:55.761
Now I don't know, I just made that up, you know.

00:55.975 --> 00:57.675
I don't know what butt crack juice is.

00:58.065 --> 01:02.881
But I knew butt, you know, anything with butt, crack, you know,...

01:03.005 --> 01:06.918
...it's gonna get a big laugh, you know. And of course they fell over, you know.

01:07.839 --> 01:09.457
What is the game called "Fly Over the Bath"?

01:10.070 --> 01:11.138
"Fly Over the Bath" is...

01:12.033 --> 01:15.275
...one kid is in the bath and he has a little squeeze toy that fills,...

01:15.382 --> 01:16.531
...you can fill it up with water...

01:16.659 --> 01:19.451
...and the other kid, I fly them over the bath.

01:19.545 --> 01:22.580
And as the one kid flies over, the kid in the bath squirts...

01:22.963 --> 01:24.117
...the other kid in the face...

01:24.718 --> 01:25.329
...with the water.

01:26.516 --> 01:28.291
And then there's another one called "Jump Up,"...

01:28.699 --> 01:33.333
...which is I lie one kid on the edge of the bed...

01:34.120 --> 01:38.998
...and they stay there and then the other kid, I throw the other kid over.

01:39.122 --> 01:42.054
And I tell the one lying on the bed, "In one minute..."

01:42.166 --> 01:46.589
"...you're gonna see a little kid dressed in pink, is gonna come flying right over your face."

01:46.737 --> 01:47.795
"So just watch out for that."

01:51.190 --> 01:53.603
It's just , you know, silliness.
