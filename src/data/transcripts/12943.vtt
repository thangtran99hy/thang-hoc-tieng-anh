Captain's Log, Star Gate 22 31 57.6.

00:05.716 --> 00:09.609
We are en route to the planet Regulate 5, sector 18,...

00:10.057 --> 00:13.124
...to deliver a vaccine to end ultraviolet fever.

00:14.863 --> 00:18.267
Captain, we're picking up something on the long-range sensors.

00:18.965 --> 00:20.148
Spek, what is it?

00:21.481 --> 00:25.174
Unknown, Captain. It's unlike anything we've ever seen.

00:25.988 --> 00:30.981
Bring up the view screen! It's too distant to make out.

00:31.997 --> 00:36.545
The brightness, the energy. Whoa!

00:37.076 --> 00:37.524
Captain.

00:38.333 --> 00:39.605
What is it, Lieutenant Orula?

00:40.496 --> 00:42.481
I'm receiving a transmission from a Klingie ship.

00:42.972 --> 00:44.554
The Klingie's have a saying, Captain,...

00:44.987 --> 00:48.053
..."If you cannot control yourself, you cannot command others."

00:50.425 --> 00:52.020
He looks like he's beaming aboard.

00:53.803 --> 00:57.775
Mr. Scootie, how much time do you require to repair the warp drive?

01:00.559 --> 01:04.935
Four bloody nanoseconds! But it's Happy Hour down here in the engineering room!

01:05.317 --> 01:08.002
I'd rather beam up a tribulator, if it's all the same to you.

01:09.243 --> 01:11.373
Shields up! Go to red alert!

01:12.172 --> 01:12.968
Aye aye, Captain!

01:16.349 --> 01:17.572
It's too late, Captain.

01:18.487 --> 01:21.747
Typical Federation, not to have your defenses ready.

01:23.243 --> 01:24.533
What do you want from us?

01:25.702 --> 01:28.246
Only your certain doom!
