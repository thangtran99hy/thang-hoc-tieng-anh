I don't wanna marry someone if I don't have a job first.

00:04.275 --> 00:07.573
If a man comes asking me, running out,...

00:07.699 --> 00:10.100
..."No, I don't wanna marry you yet!"

00:10.701 --> 00:13.423
"I want to have a job."

00:14.493 --> 00:19.143
And if he says, "I will not come back to you."

00:19.835 --> 00:21.690
Fine! I'll find a different man.

00:21.771 --> 00:24.943
This is my life, you better stop caring.

00:27.777 --> 00:32.337
I'm not gonna do anything for you until I have my job.

00:32.417 --> 00:34.363
I don't care if I marry you.

00:34.689 --> 00:36.474
I don't care if I marry another man.

00:37.111 --> 00:40.933
I care if I do something that's special.

00:41.460 --> 00:45.177
I don't wanna marry someone if I don't have a job first.
