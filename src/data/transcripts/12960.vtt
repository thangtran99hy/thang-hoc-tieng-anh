13 years after the first Harry Potter book was published,...

00:03.598 --> 00:06.927
...I'm still astonished and delighted by the response the stories met.

00:07.695 --> 00:10.477
Even though the seventh book and the eighth film have now been completed,...

00:10.807 --> 00:12.940
...I'm still receiving hundreds of letters every week...

00:13.401 --> 00:16.630
...and Harry's fans remain as enthusiastic and inventive as ever.

00:17.647 --> 00:20.099
So, I'd like to take this opportunity to say thank you,...

00:20.623 --> 00:24.395
...because no author could've asked for a more wonderful, diverse, and loyal readership.

00:25.791 --> 00:29.203
I'm thrilled to say that I am now in a position to give you something unique.

00:29.975 --> 00:32.651
An online reading experience unlike any other.

00:33.886 --> 00:35.343
It's called Pottermore.

00:36.523 --> 00:39.357
It's the same story with a few crucial additions.

00:39.672 --> 00:41.802
The most important one is you.

00:42.746 --> 00:45.777
Just as the experience of reading requires that the imaginations...

00:45.920 --> 00:48.569
...of the author and reader work together to create the story,...

00:49.134 --> 00:52.493
...so Pottermore will be built in part by you, the reader.

00:53.342 --> 00:55.801
The digital generation will be able to enjoy a safe,...

00:55.956 --> 00:59.518
...unique, online, reading experience built around the Harry Potter books.

01:00.467 --> 01:03.360
Pottermore will be the place where fans of any age can share,...

01:03.462 --> 01:06.004
...participate in, and rediscover the stories.

01:06.902 --> 01:10.306
It will also be the exclusive place to purchase digital audio books.

01:10.393 --> 01:13.688
And for the first time, e-Books of the Harry Potter series.

01:14.903 --> 01:16.161
I'll be joining in too...

01:16.699 --> 01:18.857
...because I will be sharing additional information I've...

01:18.964 --> 01:21.173
...been hoarding for years about the world of Harry Potter.

01:22.746 --> 01:24.870
Pottermore is open to everyone from October,...

01:25.727 --> 01:29.033
...but a lucky few can enter early, and help shape the experience.

01:30.018 --> 01:32.171
Simply, follow the owl.

01:33.246 --> 01:33.648
Good luck!
