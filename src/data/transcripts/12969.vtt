In 2000, I told graduates to not be afraid to fail and I still believe that.

00:06.177 --> 00:10.393
But today, I tell you that whether you fear it or not, disappointment will come.

00:11.201 --> 00:14.313
The beauty is that through disappointment, you can gain clarity...

00:14.925 --> 00:18.343
...and with clarity, comes conviction and true originality.

00:19.629 --> 00:22.281
Many of you here today are getting a diploma at this Ivy league school...

00:22.397 --> 00:25.397
...because you have committed yourself to a dream and worked hard to achieve it.

00:25.977 --> 00:29.294
And there is no greater cliche in a commencement address than "follow your dream".

00:30.317 --> 00:36.395
Well, I'm here to tell you that whatever you think your dream is now, it will probably change.

00:36.801 --> 00:37.751
And that's okay.

00:38.780 --> 00:41.210
Four years ago, many of you had specific vision...

00:41.981 --> 00:45.011
...of what your college experience was gonna be and who you were gonna become.

00:45.799 --> 00:48.893
And I bet today most of you would admit that your time here was very different...

00:49.011 --> 00:49.993
...from what you imagined.

00:50.434 --> 00:52.648
Your roommates changed, your major changed.

00:52.902 --> 00:55.172
For some of you, your sexual orientation changed.

00:55.872 --> 00:59.433
I bet some of you have changed your sexual orientation since I began this speech.

01:00.990 --> 01:01.894
I know I have.

01:04.467 --> 01:07.136
But through the good and especially the bad,...

01:07.275 --> 01:11.538
...the person you are now is someone you could never have conjured in the fall of 2007.

01:13.683 --> 01:18.413
I've told you many things today, most of it foolish but some of it true.

01:19.301 --> 01:21.830
I'd like to end my address by breaking a taboo...

01:22.243 --> 01:24.369
...and quoting myself from seventeen months ago.

01:25.853 --> 01:30.695
At the end of my final program with NBC, just before signing off, I said,...

01:31.088 --> 01:34.503
..."Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen."

01:35.502 --> 01:40.235
Today, receiving this honor and speaking to the Dartmouth class of 2011...

01:40.425 --> 01:43.817
...from behind a tree trunk, I have never believed that more.

01:44.117 --> 01:45.582
Thank you very much and congratulations!
