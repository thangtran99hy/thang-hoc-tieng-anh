Hey, everyone. I'm Sean Ramjagsingh, line producer on NHL 12...

00:15.317 --> 00:17.864
...and I'm here to talk to you about some of the exciting new features of this year's game.

00:19.540 --> 00:23.159
This year, we've taken our gameplay to the next level to match hockey's true authenticity,...

00:23.353 --> 00:25.353
...which means everything in the arena will now be live.

00:26.025 --> 00:27.632
With our brand new full contact engine,...

00:27.842 --> 00:30.324
...you'll be able to make bone - crushing hits that shatter the glass.

00:31.088 --> 00:33.959
Knock players into the bench, pop helmets off...

00:34.787 --> 00:36.712
...and create massive collisions with other players.

00:38.260 --> 00:39.867
The role for goalies just got a lot tougher.

00:40.342 --> 00:41.142
Goalies are now live...

00:41.199 --> 00:44.099
..so players can now crash the crease, even knocking the net off its mooring.

00:46.025 --> 00:48.634
Goalies will also have to deal with players jostling in front of the net for position.

00:49.043 --> 00:50.109
Fight through screens to see the puck.

00:50.968 --> 00:54.018
Getting position in front of the net is an important way to generate offense.

00:54.437 --> 00:55.357
We are now giving the user...

00:55.481 --> 00:59.550
...the ability to jostle in front of the net to try and create a screen or deflection in the offensive zone.

01:00.103 --> 01:03.189
You can also take control of a defenseman and try to clear the crease for your goal.

01:03.755 --> 01:06.798
The bigger players will use their size and strength to try and dominate down low...

01:07.299 --> 01:10.798
...while smaller players will have to try and spin off their check to create scoring opportunities.

01:11.931 --> 01:14.461
Goalies this year are gonna be much more live and dynamic.

01:15.063 --> 01:18.552
To be authentic to the game, goalies are going to react to players crashing the crease.

01:19.133 --> 01:22.533
Goalies will battle through screens, make sprawling desperation saves,...

01:22.748 --> 01:23.871
...and for the first time ever,...

01:24.250 --> 01:26.841
...goalies will be able to fight just like their real-life counterparts.

01:30.377 --> 01:31.959
You asked for it, you got it.

01:32.445 --> 01:35.883
This year will be featuring the NHL Winter Classic at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh.

01:36.681 --> 01:38.931
The Winter Classic is considered the NHL's main event...

01:39.393 --> 01:41.401
...and is traditionally hosted on New Year's Day.

01:42.403 --> 01:44.833
You'll be able to play it in this outdoor venue with your favorite teams...

01:44.967 --> 01:46.926
...while battling hostile weather conditions.

01:48.542 --> 01:49.985
Thank you for checking out NHL 12.

01:50.471 --> 01:51.937
Building off last year's highly rated game,...

01:52.169 --> 01:54.059
...we're extremely excited for another stellar year.

01:54.981 --> 01:56.643
Lace up those skates and we'll see you on the ice.

01:58.209 --> 01:59.628
We also have a huge announcement coming up...

01:59.746 --> 02:03.122
...so keep following us on Facebook and Twitter for more information on NHL 12.
