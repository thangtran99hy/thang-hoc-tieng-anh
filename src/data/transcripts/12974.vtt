00:02.094 --> 00:06.617
Our goal was to conquer North America, then every single continent on Earth.

00:07.705 --> 00:08.395
We've succeeded.

00:10.419 --> 00:13.243
It's true, we've started a bit late in the game but we're catching up.

00:14.029 --> 00:16.975
We will find every nook and cranny they missed and eat them up.

00:18.076 --> 00:20.527
But, shh! They don't know that.

00:23.349 --> 00:25.690
They can't fool us, we know what they're up to.

00:26.698 --> 00:27.485
What they don't know...

00:27.678 --> 00:31.292
...is we're forming the R&D of new technology that will let us take over the galaxy.

00:32.262 --> 00:34.231
That's right, the galaxy.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.784
We know about their galaxy plans.

00:38.020 --> 00:40.051
Ha! One step ahead, dude.

00:41.129 --> 00:43.642
Did anyone hear about the universe?

00:45.781 --> 00:48.335
Ha! The universe? What a joke.

00:49.391 --> 00:50.599
Here's the real secret:...

00:51.676 --> 00:53.482
...something bigger than the universe is out there...

00:54.707 --> 00:56.230
...and we know the person who runs it.

00:59.339 --> 01:02.934
Hey! I have a phone now too.

01:03.001 --> 01:04.553
Boo!
