English language teaching has the same challenges the world over.

00:06.541 --> 00:08.771
This series focuses on teaching speaking.

00:14.997 --> 00:19.175
We've come to Thailand to see how teachers here monitor their students' speaking activities.

00:19.655 --> 00:22.450
And we'll have expert tips from teacher trainer John Kay.

00:23.787 --> 00:28.725
One of the fears of a teacher is that if you're not involved, you're not doing your job properly.

00:28.860 --> 00:32.461
But sometimes doing your job properly means taking a backseat.

00:33.073 --> 00:38.571
Monitoring. Watch what your students are doing. Don't interfere with what your students are doing.

00:47.233 --> 00:52.179
Monitoring requires strategies. Your students are on task, so now what?

00:53.346 --> 00:57.949
First of all, you have to check that the instructions have been understood and the students are working.

00:58.139 --> 01:03.310
If your activity requires your students to work in pairs and you have one person who's leftover,...

01:03.552 --> 01:05.373
...put that person into a group of three...

01:05.669 --> 01:09.684
...so that this frees you to monitor what's happening with all the other pairs.

01:13.525 --> 01:17.011
If your students are holding back, think about why this could be.

01:17.329 --> 01:22.290
Is it because they're fearful of making mistakes? Or is it because they don't feel confident enough?

01:22.641 --> 01:26.148
Or is it perhaps because you're monitoring them too closely?

01:27.930 --> 01:31.836
Stand back, take a backseat, leave them, lose the eye contact...

01:31.957 --> 01:33.689
...so that they don't know that you're there.

01:35.088 --> 01:38.943
Sometimes it's a good idea to actually tell the students what you're monitoring for.

01:39.035 --> 01:44.329
Maybe you're monitoring for pronunciation or accuracy to see how they're actually using the language...

01:44.397 --> 01:48.369
... that they practiced beforehand. Rather than helping them just with the target language,...

01:48.665 --> 01:51.623
... are they using the useful language in their group activity?

01:51.973 --> 01:54.475
If not, maybe you could prompt them in this direction.

01:54.580 --> 01:58.705
But don't stop them from being experimental and using English. Encourage that.

01:59.608 --> 02:03.844
So what do you do if the students just haven't got it? Well go in, help them with it.

02:04.249 --> 02:12.943
But don't interfere too early. Give them a chance to sort it themselves, peer correction.

02:13.154 --> 02:18.632
Are they doing it successfully? If they don't need any help, then stay out of the way. Listen.

02:19.486 --> 02:23.553
If you need to approach a group, OK, go in there, give them a prompt.

02:23.731 --> 02:27.643
But once you've helped out, don't become part of the proceedings. Move on.

02:28.169 --> 02:32.887
If there's one person in the group who is obviously struggling, give them a monitoring task.

02:33.144 --> 02:39.241
They're listening for pronunciation or maybe they're listening for structure or maybe they're listening for use of useful language.

02:39.419 --> 02:44.537
That's their responsibility. They are part of the group and so it's not teacher - dominated.

02:45.190 --> 02:47.410
For correction purposes, make a note...

02:47.735 --> 02:51.755
...and then you can refer to it later. You can also refer to this for future lessons...

02:53.332 --> 02:56.384
If you hear something while you're monitoring that is particularly good,...

02:56.687 --> 02:59.961
...why not tell them, you know, go in there and let them know that it was good.

03:00.653 --> 03:05.003
If you've moved the students around and they've exhausted everything they want to talk about,...

03:05.226 --> 03:11.079
...don't let the task drag on. Leave them on a high. Finish while they're still busy.

03:11.229 --> 03:16.201
Time is up. I'm happy that you like it, but let's wrap up the lesson.

03:16.523 --> 03:17.645
What do we learn today?
