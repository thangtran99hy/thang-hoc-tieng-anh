Ending a relationship is even more difficult when you have to see constant updates from your ex.

00:12.959 --> 00:17.451
Take solace with these tips on getting over a breakup while preserving your dignity online.

00:18.684 --> 00:21.746
You will need: social network privacy settings,...

00:22.494 --> 00:27.257
...inner strength, positive posts, protective applications.

00:28.245 --> 00:30.284
Optional: Internet dating sites.

00:30.925 --> 00:35.421
Step one: Decide how many people in your social network you want to hear...

00:35.502 --> 00:37.608
...about your change in relationship status.

00:38.108 --> 00:40.054
It may be easier to get over a breakup...

00:40.143 --> 00:43.920
...by eliciting sympathy with a public announcement or by simply laying low.

00:44.492 --> 00:46.948
Once you've decided, adjust your privacy settings...

00:47.067 --> 00:48.945
...and switch your status if necessary.

00:49.298 --> 00:53.283
Consider removing your relationship status from your online profile entirely,...

00:53.463 --> 00:55.135
...rather than changing it to "single."

00:55.490 --> 01:01.358
Step two: Defriend, unfollow and unlink from any direct online connection to your ex.

01:02.030 --> 01:04.873
It might seem severe, but you'll get over a breakup faster...

01:04.964 --> 01:10.003
...without reading about their rebounds or seeing pictures of them loving life when you're feeling down.

01:11.012 --> 01:13.377
Step three: Post positively.

01:13.759 --> 01:16.370
If you and your ex share gossipy online friends,...

01:16.491 --> 01:19.175
...at least make them think you're okay about the breakup.

01:19.683 --> 01:22.495
Don't post platitudes or cliche song lyrics.

01:24.534 --> 01:27.943
Instead, write updates that describe new developments in your own life.

01:28.496 --> 01:32.065
"Finally stopped crying" is not a new development worth posting.

01:33.855 --> 01:38.446
Step four: Put up online safeguards to protect yourself in moments of weakness.

01:38.755 --> 01:41.473
Download applications that keep you from searching for names...

01:41.549 --> 01:44.711
...or sending e-mails when you're depressed, drunk or both.

01:46.217 --> 01:49.202
Step five: Over the breakup and ready to move on?

01:49.531 --> 01:51.953
Check out online dating sites and your friends' friends...

01:52.045 --> 01:54.523
...and connections for potential flings or partners,...

01:54.883 --> 01:57.699
...and make finding a new love as easy as logging on.

01:58.231 --> 01:58.753
Did you know?

01:59.359 --> 02:01.515
According to a 2010 global poll,...

02:01.917 --> 02:06.283
...30% of web users think the Internet is a good place to meet a romantic partner.
