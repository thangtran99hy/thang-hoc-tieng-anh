One of the keys to Apple is Apple's an incredibly collaborative company.

00:11.833 --> 00:13.502
Do you know how many committees we have at Apple?

00:13.764 --> 00:13.995
No.

00:14.958 --> 00:17.717
Zero, we have no committees.

00:17.899 --> 00:18.313
No committees.

00:19.513 --> 00:21.917
We are organized like a start-up.

00:22.892 --> 00:26.651
One person's in charge of iPhone OS software.

00:26.935 --> 00:29.353
One person's in charge of Mac hardware.

00:29.694 --> 00:32.436
One person's in charge of iPhone hardware engineering.

00:32.828 --> 00:36.036
Another person's in charge of worldwide marketing.

00:36.187 --> 00:38.677
Another person's in charge of operations.

00:39.711 --> 00:41.150
We're organized like a start-up.

00:41.315 --> 00:43.333
We're the biggest start-up on the planet.

00:44.197 --> 00:51.524
And we all meet for three hours once a week and we talk about everything we're doing,...

00:51.853 --> 00:52.649
...the whole business.

00:53.615 --> 00:57.011
And there's tremendous teamwork at the top of the company...

00:57.364 --> 01:00.639
...which filters down to tremendous teamwork throughout the company.

01:01.195 --> 01:04.742
And teamwork is dependent on trusting the other folks...

01:05.153 --> 01:08.237
...to come through with their part without watching them all the time...

01:08.772 --> 01:11.371
...but trusting that they're gonna come through with their parts.

01:11.855 --> 01:14.551
And that's what we do really well.

01:15.013 --> 01:20.157
And we're great at figuring out how to divide things up into these great teams that we have...

01:20.671 --> 01:24.379
...and all work on the same thing, touch bases frequently...

01:24.810 --> 01:26.747
...and bring it all together into a product.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.379
We do that really well.

01:28.935 --> 01:33.889
And so, what I do all day is meet with teams of people...

01:34.663 --> 01:38.454
...and work on ideas and solve problems...

01:38.807 --> 01:42.269
...to make new products, to make new marketing programs, whatever it is.

01:42.347 --> 01:44.392
And are people willing to tell you you're wrong?

01:46.570 --> 01:46.925
Yeah.

01:47.113 --> 01:50.705
I mean, other than snarky journalists; I mean, people that work with you.

01:50.891 --> 01:53.438
No, we have wonderful arguments.

01:54.721 --> 01:55.781
And do you win them all?

01:55.963 --> 01:57.169
Oh no, I wish I did!

01:58.035 --> 01:59.283
Now see, you can't.

01:59.731 --> 02:03.465
If you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you,...

02:03.931 --> 02:08.104
...you have to let them make a lot of decisions and you have to...

02:09.438 --> 02:12.603
...be run by ideas, not hierarchy.

02:13.035 --> 02:14.811
The best ideas have to win.

02:15.256 --> 02:16.846
Otherwise, good people don't stay.

02:16.947 --> 02:20.716
But you must be more than a facilitator who runs meetings; you obviously contribute...

02:20.829 --> 02:21.403
....your own idea.

02:21.492 --> 02:22.949
I contribute ideas, sure!

02:23.596 --> 02:25.019
Why would I be there if I didn't?
