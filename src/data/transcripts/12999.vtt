00:00.535 --> 00:02.890
So, I get to talk about iCloud.

00:03.389 --> 00:05.495
We've been working on this for some time now...

00:06.090 --> 00:07.775
...and we're really excited about it.

00:09.543 --> 00:14.593
About 10 years ago, we had one of our most important insights.

00:15.206 --> 00:22.710
And that was that the PC was gonna become the digital hub for your digital life.

00:23.838 --> 00:24.475
What did that mean?

00:24.625 --> 00:28.295
Well, it meant that that's where you were gonna put your digital photos.

00:28.397 --> 00:29.514
Where else were you gonna put them?

00:31.125 --> 00:33.588
Your digital video off your digital camcorder.

00:34.369 --> 00:35.779
And of course, your music.

00:36.581 --> 00:41.159
Right? You were gonna acquire it in a device or potentially on your Mac...

00:42.529 --> 00:47.490
...and you were gonna basically sync it to the Mac and everything was gonna work fine.

00:48.202 --> 00:51.577
And it did, for the better part of 10 years.

00:52.219 --> 00:55.833
But it's broken down in the last few years.

00:57.028 --> 01:01.262
Why? Well, because the devices have changed.

01:01.915 --> 01:03.913
They now all have music.

01:04.401 --> 01:06.185
They now all have photos.

01:06.860 --> 01:08.423
They now all have video.

01:09.075 --> 01:13.951
And so, if I acquire a song, I buy it right on my iPhone.

01:14.872 --> 01:17.055
I wanna get that to my other devices.

01:17.573 --> 01:20.236
Right? I pick up my iPad and it doesn't have that song on it.

01:20.849 --> 01:23.574
And we think this solution is our next big insight.

01:24.211 --> 01:29.741
Which is, we're gonna demote the PC and the Mac to just be a device.

01:30.433 --> 01:33.762
Just like an iPhone, an iPad or an iPod touch.

01:34.902 --> 01:40.814
And we're going to move the digital hub, the center of your digital life, into the cloud.

01:41.816 --> 01:45.333
Because all these new devices have communications built into them,...

01:45.721 --> 01:48.508
...they can all talk to the cloud whenever they want.

01:49.829 --> 01:56.413
And so now, if i get something on my iPhone, it sends up to the cloud immediately.

01:56.514 --> 01:58.275
Let's say, I take some pictures with it.

01:58.899 --> 02:01.851
Those pictures are in the cloud and they are now...

02:02.149 --> 02:05.772
...pushed down to my devices, completely automatically.

02:06.599 --> 02:15.205
Now, iCloud stores your content in the cloud and wirelessly pushes it to all your devices.

02:15.843 --> 02:21.257
So, as an example, in contacts, when I make a new contact...

02:21.591 --> 02:26.323
...on my iPhone, it's automatically brought up to the cloud where it's stored on the cloud.

02:26.971 --> 02:28.548
Right? The truth is on the cloud.

02:29.125 --> 02:33.716
And then, it's automatically pushed down to my other devices so they're all in sync.

02:34.123 --> 02:38.121
So, these are the three apps that form the core of MobileMe.

02:38.982 --> 02:43.546
We used to sell them for a subscription price of 99 dollars annually.

02:44.325 --> 02:47.602
As of today, this product ceases to exist.

02:49.055 --> 02:51.111
And those three apps are now gonna be free.
