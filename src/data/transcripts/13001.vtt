00:02.725 --> 00:04.499
My name is Jose Antonio Vargas.

00:05.837 --> 00:07.175
I was born in the Philippines.

00:07.467 --> 00:09.483
I moved to the United States when I was 12.

00:09.769 --> 00:13.944
English was my second language and I learned to speak American...

00:14.407 --> 00:18.253
...by watching "Frasier," "Home Improvement" and "The Golden Girls."

00:19.021 --> 00:22.612
I won the spelling bee in eighth grade by spelling indefatigable.

00:24.298 --> 00:26.607
In high school, I fell in love with journalism.

00:26.875 --> 00:29.860
I started working for my local newspaper, The Mountain View Voice.

00:30.557 --> 00:33.106
Then, I got hired at The Washington Post.

00:33.419 --> 00:38.055
I covered the 2008 presidential campaign from traveling on Hillary Clinton's plane...

00:38.195 --> 00:40.243
...to pheasant hunting with Huckabee.

00:40.947 --> 00:45.798
I interviewed Al Gore for Rolling Stone and profiled Mark Zuckerberg for The New Yorker.

00:46.190 --> 00:49.321
I even won a Pulitzer Prize for covering the Virginia Tech massacre.

00:51.248 --> 00:56.013
At age 16, I rode my bike to the DMV to get my driver's permit.

00:57.567 --> 00:58.838
I brought my green card with me.

01:00.491 --> 01:06.709
The woman at the DMV flipped it around, she leaned over...

01:07.246 --> 01:13.909
...and she whispered, "This is fake, don't come back here again."

01:15.345 --> 01:17.375
I went home and confronted my grandfather.

01:18.385 --> 01:26.413
That was the first time I realized that I'm an undocumented immigrant,...

01:27.669 --> 01:30.212
...what some people call an "illegal."

01:32.739 --> 01:35.661
The first person I told was Mrs. Denny, my choir teacher.

01:35.927 --> 01:40.832
Other members of my underground railroad include Rich Fisher, my high school superintendent,...

01:41.291 --> 01:43.507
...and Pat Hyland, my high school principal.

01:44.667 --> 01:49.697
For more than a decade now, Pat and Rich have been with me every step of the way.

01:50.609 --> 01:53.345
I define American as someone who works really hard.

01:54.545 --> 01:58.613
Someone who's proud to be in this country...

01:58.809 --> 02:01.022
...and wants to contribute to it.

02:01.967 --> 02:02.880
I'm independent.

02:03.906 --> 02:04.893
I pay taxes.

02:05.684 --> 02:06.715
I'm self-sufficient.

02:09.421 --> 02:13.764
I'm an American; I just don't have the right papers.

02:15.441 --> 02:18.787
I take full responsibility for my actions,...

02:19.523 --> 02:21.287
...and I'm sorry for the laws that I broke.

02:23.485 --> 02:26.675
What would you do if you were a choir teacher and found out...

02:26.781 --> 02:29.941
...that a student in your glee club can't travel for competition?

02:30.394 --> 02:33.825
What would you do if you were a high school principal and found out...

02:33.981 --> 02:37.676
...that one of your students can't apply for financial aid?

02:39.074 --> 02:41.611
What would you do if your child's best friend didn't have papers?

02:43.555 --> 02:48.484
As a journalist, I've decided to do what I know best: ask questions.

02:50.417 --> 02:54.584
So let's talk. What would you do?
