00:00.829 --> 00:02.568
You never know what is around the corner...

00:03.411 --> 00:04.319
...unless you peek.

00:06.130 --> 00:07.971
Hold someone's hand while you do it.

00:09.102 --> 00:10.588
You'll feel less scared.

00:12.667 --> 00:13.905
You can't do this alone.

00:15.353 --> 00:19.200
Besides, it's much more fun to succeed and fail with other people.

00:20.440 --> 00:22.143
You can blame them when things go wrong.

00:24.796 --> 00:26.371
Take your risks now.

00:27.549 --> 00:32.457
As you grow older, you become more fearful and less flexible.

00:33.354 --> 00:35.920
Try to keep your mind open to possibilities...

00:37.000 --> 00:39.534
...and your mouth closed on matters that you don't know about.

00:40.720 --> 00:43.658
Limit your "always" and your "nevers".

00:45.135 --> 00:47.313
Continue to share your heart with people,...

00:48.300 --> 00:49.169
...even if it's been broken.

00:50.052 --> 00:54.179
When you feel scared, hold someone's hand...

00:55.000 --> 00:56.058
...and look into their eyes.

00:57.464 --> 00:59.055
And when you feel brave,...

01:00.149 --> 01:01.241
...do the same thing.

01:03.820 --> 01:06.098
You are all here because you are smart...

01:07.200 --> 01:07.994
...and you are brave.

01:09.129 --> 01:10.635
And if you add kindness...

01:11.292 --> 01:13.062
...and the ability to change a tire,...

01:14.331 --> 01:16.468
...you almost make up the perfect person.
