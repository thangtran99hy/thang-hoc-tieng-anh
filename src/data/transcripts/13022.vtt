00:01.130 --> 00:03.755
We're proud of the effort you've invested...

00:04.743 --> 00:06.726
...and the risks that you took.

00:07.436 --> 00:09.808
We're proud of the bonds that you've forged,...

00:09.893 --> 00:11.623
...the growth that you've shown.

00:12.877 --> 00:17.419
We're proud of how for the past four years you've immersed yourself...

00:17.497 --> 00:21.271
...in the life of the school and embraced all that it has to offer.

00:22.030 --> 00:24.304
Some of you may have grown up like me...

00:25.099 --> 00:28.639
...in neighborhoods where few had the chance to go to college,...

00:29.763 --> 00:33.494
...where being teased for doing well in school was a fact of life,...

00:35.135 --> 00:39.772
...where well-meaning but misguided folks question whether a girl with my background,...

00:40.177 --> 00:42.199
...could get into a school like Princeton.

00:44.301 --> 00:46.907
Sometimes, I'd save them the trouble...

00:47.891 --> 00:51.329
...and raised the questions myself in my own head,...

00:52.215 --> 00:56.129
...lying awake at night doubting whether I had what it took to succeed.

00:57.993 --> 01:01.722
And the truth is that there will always be folks out there...

01:02.679 --> 01:04.615
...who make assumptions about others.

01:05.359 --> 01:10.155
There will always be folks who try to raise themselves up by cutting other people down.

01:11.916 --> 01:15.821
That happens to everyone, including me, throughout their lives.

01:17.127 --> 01:20.721
But when that happens to you all, here's what I want you to do.

01:21.611 --> 01:23.138
I want you to just stop a minute.

01:23.828 --> 01:27.129
Take a deep breath 'cause it's gonna need to be deep.

01:28.648 --> 01:32.027
And I want you to all think about all those women who came before you.

01:33.205 --> 01:37.855
You all, are the keepers of each other's histories.

01:38.804 --> 01:42.387
And the bonds that you formed here will nourish you...

01:43.066 --> 01:46.052
...and sustain you for the rest of your lives.

01:47.449 --> 01:50.079
Now, that is sisterhood.

01:50.829 --> 01:52.345
Claim what is yours.

01:53.615 --> 01:56.979
You belong anywhere on this Earth if you want to.

01:58.363 --> 02:02.413
And graduates, if you go out there and make that claim,...

02:03.776 --> 02:06.313
...if you reach back to help others do the same,...

02:07.163 --> 02:12.473
...then I am confident that you would lead lives worthy of your dreams...

02:13.197 --> 02:17.607
...and you will fulfill that precious Spelman legacy that is now yours.

02:18.617 --> 02:20.506
So, congratulations graduates...

02:21.081 --> 02:22.925
...on all that you have achieved.

02:23.663 --> 02:25.587
I am so proud of you.

02:26.604 --> 02:27.371
All of you.

02:27.821 --> 02:30.239
We are so proud of you.

02:30.709 --> 02:31.786
Do big things.

02:32.316 --> 02:34.209
Thank you, all. God Bless!
