Tyrannybook.

00:03.857 --> 00:06.148
Social media is a powerful tool...

00:06.751 --> 00:10.169
...and we believe it can also be used for more relevant things.

00:11.289 --> 00:15.474
That is why Amnesty International, Portugal created Tyrannybook.

00:15.878 --> 00:20.158
Here, instead of watching your friends, you can watch your enemies.

00:20.833 --> 00:22.619
But who are the enemies?

00:23.087 --> 00:27.007
Every world leader who has no respect for human rights.

00:28.339 --> 00:31.970
We can still prove with our own intelligence information that...

00:32.837 --> 00:36.932
...he is guilty, sufficiently guilty to be able to be detained.

00:37.574 --> 00:40.512
Here, their acts are updated as they happen.

00:41.279 --> 00:43.725
You can watch as many tyrants as you want.

00:44.447 --> 00:47.150
Become an ally with others who watch these tyrants.

00:48.117 --> 00:51.967
Exchange information, links, pictures, videos...

00:52.560 --> 00:56.011
"Nkomo has always denied that he controls dissidents."

00:57.578 --> 00:59.578
...and find out how to help.

01:00.841 --> 01:04.475
You can also invite friends from other social networks to join in.

01:05.855 --> 01:10.179
After all, the more people we have watching, the more these dictators...

01:10.259 --> 01:14.225
...will realize that their evil acts are not going unnoticed.

01:14.891 --> 01:15.575
Tyrannybook.

01:16.179 --> 01:18.635
Join. Fight. Change.
