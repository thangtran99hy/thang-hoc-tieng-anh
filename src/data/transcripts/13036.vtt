Eddie, so good to talk to you.

00:02.617 --> 00:04.675
And I ask everybody this thing.

00:06.009 --> 00:08.411
How old were you and where were you that...

00:09.539 --> 00:11.118
...music started, you know,...

00:11.589 --> 00:12.689
...being a thing for you.

00:13.351 --> 00:14.471
I think love of music.

00:14.605 --> 00:15.468
Had a couple uncles,...

00:15.598 --> 00:18.845
...I was the oldest of the kids but I got a couple uncles who,...

00:20.253 --> 00:22.701
...you know, I'd steal their Beatles records.

00:22.983 --> 00:24.621
I remember stealing Yellow Submarine,...

00:25.331 --> 00:26.604
...Woodstock, had a lot of stuff...

00:26.693 --> 00:29.161
...so that was, I was five or six.

00:29.901 --> 00:31.257
So you started singing first?

00:31.606 --> 00:34.501
Yeah, I picked up a guitar when I was about 12.

00:34.719 --> 00:36.773
Kinda toughed it out for a bit and at one point,...

00:36.906 --> 00:39.014
...I gave myself a certain amount of years...

00:39.401 --> 00:41.243
...to do something as a musician...

00:41.961 --> 00:45.465
...and played in bands here and there and got better at it.

00:45.585 --> 00:47.600
And then ended up in Seattle.

00:48.635 --> 00:49.791
How'd you go out to Seattle?

00:51.687 --> 00:56.389
A good friend of mine got an offer to play drums in a band up there.

00:57.149 --> 00:58.911
And then they said, "By the way do you know any singers?"

00:59.241 --> 01:02.426
And he threw me a tape, recorded on a 4-track...

01:03.209 --> 01:06.838
...that morning like three songs then sent 'em off and never thought anything about it and then...

01:08.772 --> 01:11.586
...couple of weeks later they flew me up to Seattle and we started playing together.

01:12.842 --> 01:15.073
You know, it's funny because we've been listening to that stuff recently...

01:15.188 --> 01:18.841
...'cause we put out some of that early demo stuff and I hadn't heard it...

01:19.070 --> 01:21.054
...since, what, 18 years ago or something.

01:21.429 --> 01:26.285
And it was interesting to hear, almost terrifying because...

01:27.369 --> 01:30.901
...I don't really remember spending more than three or four hours on these three songs.

01:31.116 --> 01:34.630
But it was probably, in the end, you know, I look to where I have a family now,...

01:35.913 --> 01:37.788
...I think it was like the best life I've ever lived.

01:37.993 --> 01:38.709
That's history.
