It's easier to shed extra pounds if you know a few tricks.

00:10.113 --> 00:13.320
You will need: a blue light bulb, low-cal starters,...

00:13.624 --> 00:16.743
...limited food choices at meals and smaller plates and bowls.

00:17.187 --> 00:20.460
Step 1:  Change the light bulb in your refrigerator to a blue one.

00:20.819 --> 00:23.207
It will make everything in the fridge look unappetizing...

00:23.315 --> 00:26.493
...because we unconsciously associate blue with moldy food.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.835
Yellow, red, and orange stimulate the appetite.

00:31.243 --> 00:34.315
Step 2: Eat an apple, a small low-cal salad,...

00:34.426 --> 00:36.209
...or a cup of soup before lunch and dinner,...

00:36.526 --> 00:38.341
...especially if you're having a fattening entree.

00:38.719 --> 00:42.938
Studies show you'll consume fewer total calories because you'll be less hungry for the main meal.

00:43.529 --> 00:46.833
Step 3:  Limit the number of different tastes at each meal.

00:47.660 --> 00:51.436
Research has shown that if we are experiencing just one taste, like a casserole,...

00:51.901 --> 00:53.301
...we'll stop eating when we're full.

00:53.674 --> 00:58.482
But if we allow our taste buds to jump around from sweet to salty to savory and back again,...

00:58.731 --> 01:00.728
...we tend to eat past the point of fullness.

01:03.352 --> 01:09.288
Variety is a main reason we eat an extra 1,500 to 5,000 calories at Thanksgiving dinner alone.

01:09.825 --> 01:12.202
Step 4: Cut down on added sugar,...

01:12.511 --> 01:14.415
...sugar that doesn't occur naturally in food.

01:14.773 --> 01:20.019
The average American consumes 30 teaspoons, 450 calories of added sugar per day.

01:20.443 --> 01:23.689
Think about that before you pour sugar into beverages and onto foods.

01:24.024 --> 01:27.177
And avoid foods that list sugar as one of the first three ingredients...

01:27.360 --> 01:29.247
...or that contain several types of sugar.

01:29.839 --> 01:35.894
Fructose, corn syrup, fruit juice concentrate, malt syrup, sucrose, molasses, dextrose,...

01:35.977 --> 01:37.724
...and glucose are all sugars.

01:38.142 --> 01:40.520
Step 5: Eat off smaller plates.

01:40.881 --> 01:43.905
Studies show you'll eat fewer calories without even missing them.

01:46.565 --> 01:49.467
Did you know? Sugar-free gum isn't calorie-free.

01:49.779 --> 01:51.797
One stick has five to ten calories.
