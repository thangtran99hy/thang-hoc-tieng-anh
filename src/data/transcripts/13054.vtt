00:00.379 --> 00:01.618
I don't want to tell you a story.

00:02.987 --> 00:03.987
I want to make a case.

00:05.383 --> 00:11.439
I want to make a hardheaded, evidence - based, dare I say lawyerly case...

00:12.219 --> 00:14.659
...for rethinking how we run our businesses.

00:15.767 --> 00:19.772
So ladies and gentlemen of the jury, take a look at this.

00:20.238 --> 00:22.252
This is called the candle problem.

00:22.522 --> 00:23.891
Some of you might have seen this before.

00:24.100 --> 00:27.598
It's created in 1945 by a psychologist named Karl Duncker.

00:28.075 --> 00:32.897
Karl Duncker created this experiment that he used in a whole variety of experiments in behavioral science.

00:33.145 --> 00:34.104
And here's how it works.

00:34.447 --> 00:35.627
Suppose I'm the experimenter.

00:35.917 --> 00:37.337
I bring you into a room.

00:37.653 --> 00:41.725
I give you a candle, some thumbtacks and some matches.

00:41.939 --> 00:42.817
And I say to you,...

00:42.899 --> 00:49.073
"Your job is to attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn't drip onto the table."

00:49.299 --> 00:50.377
Now, what would you do?

00:50.479 --> 00:53.644
Many people begin trying to thumbtack the candle to the wall.

00:54.357 --> 00:55.067
Doesn't work.

00:55.695 --> 01:00.037
Somebody, some people; and I saw somebody kind of make the motion over here.

01:00.413 --> 01:03.210
Some people have a great idea where they light the match,...

01:03.603 --> 01:06.238
...melt the side of the candle, try to adhere it to the wall.

01:06.527 --> 01:07.619
It's an awesome idea.

01:07.974 --> 01:08.578
Doesn't work.

01:09.685 --> 01:13.631
And eventually after five or ten minutes, most people figure out the solution,...

01:13.872 --> 01:14.793
...which you can see here.

01:15.725 --> 01:19.302
The key is to overcome what's called functional fixedness.

01:19.580 --> 01:23.245
You look at that box and you see it only as a receptacle for the tacks...

01:23.622 --> 01:27.083
...but it can also have this other function, as a platform for the candle.

01:27.837 --> 01:28.572
The candle problem.
