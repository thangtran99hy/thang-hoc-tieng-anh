00:04.702 --> 00:06.697
The History of English in Ten Minutes.

00:07.031 --> 00:10.643
Chapter ten, global English or whose language is it anyway?

00:11.505 --> 00:13.873
In the 15 hundred years since the Romans left Britain,...

00:14.177 --> 00:17.119
...English has shown a unique ability to absorb, evolve, invade...

00:17.380 --> 00:18.356
...and if we're honest, steal.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.283
After foreign settlers got it started,...

00:20.568 --> 00:22.880
...it grew into a fully-fledged language all of its own...

00:23.193 --> 00:24.922
...before leaving home and traveling the world.

00:25.197 --> 00:28.679
First via the high seas, then via the high-speed broadband connection,...

00:29.000 --> 00:31.418
...pilfering words from over 350 languages...

00:31.619 --> 00:33.876
...and establishing itself as a global institution.

00:34.346 --> 00:38.145
All this despite a written alphabet that bears no correlation to how it sounds...

00:38.413 --> 00:41.193
...and a system of spelling that even Dan Brown couldn't decipher.

00:41.817 --> 00:44.892
Right now, around 1.5 billion people speak English.

00:45.347 --> 00:47.369
Of these, about a quarter are native speakers,...

00:47.684 --> 00:49.441
...a quarter speak it as their second language...

00:49.615 --> 00:51.827
...and half are able to ask for directions to a swimming pool.

00:52.357 --> 00:54.326
There's Hinglish, which is Hindi English,...

00:54.582 --> 00:58.780
...Chinglish, which is Chinese English and Singlish, which is Singaporean English,...

00:58.919 --> 01:00.964
...and not that bit where they speak in musicals.

01:01.463 --> 01:04.618
So, in conclusion, the language has got so little to do with England these days.

01:04.792 --> 01:06.768
It may well be time to stop calling it English.

01:07.046 --> 01:08.804
If someone does think up a new name for it,...

01:08.975 --> 01:10.747
...it should probably be in Chinese.
