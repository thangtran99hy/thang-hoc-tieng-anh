00:04.771 --> 00:06.709
The History of English in Ten Minutes.

00:07.091 --> 00:10.567
Chapter Nine, Internet English or Language Reverts to Type.

00:11.441 --> 00:15.480
In 1972, the first e-mail was sent. Soon, the Internet arrived.

00:15.793 --> 00:20.135
A free global space to share information ideas and amusing pictures of cats.

00:20.369 --> 00:22.807
Before the Internet, English changed through people speaking it.

00:23.193 --> 00:24.871
But the Net brought typing back into fashion...

00:25.045 --> 00:27.498
...and hundreds of cases of repetitive strain injury.

00:28.111 --> 00:31.935
Nobody had ever had to download anything before, let alone use a toolbar.

00:32.223 --> 00:33.955
And the only time someone set up a firewall,...

00:34.213 --> 00:37.387
...it ended with a massive insurance claim and a huge pile of charred wallpaper.

00:38.111 --> 00:40.642
Conversations were getting shorter than the average attention span.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.481
Why bother writing a sentence when an abbreviation would do...

00:43.711 --> 00:47.789
...and leave you more time to "blog," "poke" and "reboot" when your hard drive "crashed"?

00:48.327 --> 00:53.125
"In my humble opinion" became IMHO, "by the way" became BTW...

00:53.405 --> 00:56.149
...and "if we're honest that life - threatening accident was pretty hilarious"...

00:56.494 --> 00:57.623
...simply became FAIL.

00:58.276 --> 01:00.479
Some changes even passed into spoken English.

01:01.112 --> 01:02.039
"For your information",...

01:02.335 --> 01:03.831
...people "frequently ask questions" like,...

01:04.123 --> 01:07.232
..."How can LOL mean 'laugh out loud' and 'lots of love'?"

01:07.659 --> 01:10.426
If you're gonna complain about that, then UG2BK.
