00:00.917 --> 00:03.755
Whole families came out in the pre - dawn darkness...

00:03.851 --> 00:06.566
...to watch the last landing of the space shuttle.

00:06.951 --> 00:10.757
It was an unforgettable moment for many space enthusiasts...

00:10.906 --> 00:12.460
...like this woman from Canada.

00:12.594 --> 00:15.572
Oh my goodness, beautiful.

00:16.259 --> 00:18.336
A one-time thing and one in a lifetime.

00:18.579 --> 00:23.682
After completing post - landing procedures, the four - person crew emerged from the orbiter...

00:23.774 --> 00:26.345
...and Mission Commander Chris Ferguson spoke.

00:26.779 --> 00:29.941
Although we got to take the ride, we sure hope that everybody...

00:31.014 --> 00:36.429
...who has ever worked or touched or looked at or envied or admired the space shuttle...

00:37.362 --> 00:39.940
...was able to take just a little part of the journey with us.

00:40.286 --> 00:44.676
But many of the ordinary citizens who came to see the last shuttle landing...

00:44.987 --> 00:48.403
...expressed doubt about the future of the US space program,...

00:48.504 --> 00:51.474
...including Tony Diaz who came up from Miami.

00:51.792 --> 00:57.333
I really am not very happy about it and what they've done with the space program.

00:57.603 --> 00:58.520
I'm not happy at all.

00:58.827 --> 00:59.079
Why?

01:00.050 --> 01:02.961
Because this is, you know, we're the leaders and...

01:03.032 --> 01:05.765
...the United States should be always up there in space.

01:06.326 --> 01:09.758
This concern was shared by NASA worker Jonathan Miller.

01:10.072 --> 01:15.784
The future of human space flight is critical to this nation as a leader in space...

01:16.794 --> 01:19.483
...and we're nervous that some of that leadership is lost.

01:19.554 --> 01:22.867
I mean, there's a thirty years of momentum behind the shuttle program...

01:22.968 --> 01:25.459
...and it's just come to an end moments ago.

01:25.715 --> 01:29.399
But Florida resident, Rob Hansen, is more optimistic.

01:29.648 --> 01:33.972
We're moving on to privatizing this kind of operation and...

01:34.775 --> 01:38.062
...NASA is gonna move on to exploration deeper out.

01:38.143 --> 01:40.327
So, I think that'll work out in the long run.

01:40.501 --> 01:45.152
Vehicles being developed by private companies to transport astronauts into orbit...

01:45.229 --> 01:47.404
...will not be ready for at least a few years.

01:47.581 --> 01:53.410
But NASA officials say US space exploration will continue with trips to an asteroid...

01:53.544 --> 01:55.883
...and to Mars in the decades ahead.
