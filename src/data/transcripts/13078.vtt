I think leadership is about three things:...

00:04.130 --> 00:09.071
...capability, collaboration, and character.

00:10.915 --> 00:14.587
Let me talk briefly about those three and then I'm going to take your questions.

00:14.765 --> 00:15.491
Capability.

00:16.874 --> 00:20.015
Of course we think about capability, we think about skills;...

00:20.535 --> 00:21.941
...we think about experiences.

00:22.004 --> 00:26.283
But sometimes, the most important capability you can have...

00:27.617 --> 00:32.691
...is the capability to ask a question and hear the answer.

00:32.981 --> 00:36.423
I tell people all the time that the single best leading indicator...

00:36.519 --> 00:41.483
...of whether a business is doing well or a business is doing poorly is customer satisfaction.

00:41.753 --> 00:43.319
They can't always tell you what they want...

00:43.694 --> 00:45.201
...but they can always tell you what's wrong.

00:45.715 --> 00:48.737
And every time they tell you something that's wrong, it's an opportunity.

00:49.181 --> 00:53.201
Way back in 2002, we were going through the proxy battle and the merger...

00:53.285 --> 00:57.765
...and I made the incredibly outrageous comment...

00:58.159 --> 01:01.171
...that Hewlett-Packard would become the leading technology company in the world...

01:01.239 --> 01:02.796
...and would beat both IBM and Dell.

01:03.430 --> 01:04.730
Everyone thought I was nuts.

01:04.925 --> 01:08.301
The truth is Dell's problems were all foreseeable.

01:08.964 --> 01:12.257
All you had to do was look at the fact that they had quit innovating;...

01:12.814 --> 01:14.427
...they had stopped taking risks;...

01:14.806 --> 01:18.895
...they were relying on the same competitive model for too long.

01:19.166 --> 01:22.575
So capability, you've got to ask the right questions.

01:22.812 --> 01:28.331
Capability, you have to celebrate new ideas, take risks all the time, try new things...

01:29.447 --> 01:32.851
...because however good the answers you have had are,...

01:33.155 --> 01:38.066
...every person, every organization eventually reaches a time...

01:38.907 --> 01:41.303
...when the old answers aren't good enough anymore.

01:42.900 --> 01:49.149
The other important part about capability I think, is to keep learning,...

01:49.947 --> 01:51.669
...to learn something every day.

01:52.141 --> 01:55.632
And a big part of that difference is, the people who keep learning,...

01:56.538 --> 02:01.416
...who keep trying new things are vibrant; and the people who stop learning...

02:01.561 --> 02:05.361
...and stop trying new things are old before their time.

02:05.715 --> 02:12.904
It is why, or maybe it's another application of something Charles Darwin said.

02:13.648 --> 02:14.613
Charles Darwin said,...

02:14.691 --> 02:17.385
..."It is not the strongest of the species that survives,..."

02:17.466 --> 02:21.251
"...nor the most intelligent but those most adaptive to change."
