Amy Winehouse has been confirmed dead at the age of 27 in Camden Square, London...

00:05.753 --> 00:07.351
...according to police on the scene.

00:08.155 --> 00:11.360
The suspected cause of death is being classified as unexplained...

00:11.609 --> 00:14.337
...but it's rumored that drug overdose may be the real culprit.

00:15.235 --> 00:17.776
The troubled singer has had well - documented struggles...

00:17.887 --> 00:19.849
...with substance abuse through the years.

00:21.018 --> 00:25.370
Although drugs are suspected, they haven't been ruled as the cause of death as of yet.

00:26.099 --> 00:29.883
Press Officer Richard Jones of the Metropolitan Police told Artisan News...

00:29.947 --> 00:32.169
...that it remains officially unexplained.

00:32.875 --> 00:36.297
He was also asked if drug paraphernalia was found at the scene.

00:36.801 --> 00:40.952
He said that an autopsy or postmortem will be scheduled in the next few days.

00:41.265 --> 00:44.727
But he added it might be a while before they find out what killed the singer.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.557
Winehouse had a meteoric rise and fall,...

00:47.823 --> 00:51.734
...capturing the world's imagination with the song "Rehab" off of "Back to Black",...

00:52.053 --> 00:55.488
...which was her last album to date and released in 2006.

00:56.170 --> 00:59.065
She took home five Grammy awards for the 50th anniversary...

00:59.352 --> 01:03.705
...and although she was denied a visa to enter the US due to previous drug infractions,...

01:03.973 --> 01:06.425
...she accepted and performed via satellite.

01:07.145 --> 01:08.178
She said at the time,...

01:09.003 --> 01:11.907
"...Thank you to everyone at Island Records,..."

01:13.532 --> 01:17.252
"...everyone here at EMI Music Publishing, to Ray Ray..."

01:17.657 --> 01:21.460
"...and Jo. Ten years this year, Ray Ray and Jo."

01:22.254 --> 01:31.697
"To Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi, to my mom and dad. For my Blake, my Blake incarcerated..."

01:32.130 --> 01:37.031
"...and for London. This is for London 'cause Camden town is burning down."

01:39.174 --> 01:41.967
Amy Winehouse had booked a European tour this past June...

01:42.228 --> 01:46.805
...but a reportedly boozy performance and her being booed off stage in Belgrade...

01:47.073 --> 01:50.518
...caused her to pull off tour and cancel shows to sort herself out.

01:51.500 --> 01:54.599
Apparently, Winehouse has left behind a slew of recordings...

01:54.829 --> 01:58.105
...but there's no word on if and when those will be released.

01:58.883 --> 02:02.963
Amy Jade Winehouse was born on September 14th, 1983.
