00:02.743 --> 00:04.087
The scene of a massacre.

00:04.585 --> 00:07.365
Hundreds of young people had gathered at Utaoya island...

00:07.453 --> 00:10.799
...for summer school organized by Norway's ruling labor party.

00:11.441 --> 00:14.809
They had just heard a powerful bomb had ripped through central Oslo,...

00:15.283 --> 00:18.401
...damaging the Prime Minister's office and the finance ministry.

00:18.973 --> 00:21.582
But the situation was about to get much worse.

00:22.256 --> 00:27.294
It is thought the bomber caught a ferry to nearby Utaoya island wearing a police uniform.

00:30.191 --> 00:31.514
The man was standing upright.

00:31.921 --> 00:34.943
He was dressed as a policeman and pretended he was there to help us.

00:35.598 --> 00:36.949
He tried to lure us closer.

00:37.297 --> 00:38.633
He said, "Come here."

00:40.210 --> 00:42.851
He had a sniper rifle; he tried to shoot us with it.

00:44.311 --> 00:48.655
It was total chaos; people jumped into the sea to try and get to the other side.

00:50.395 --> 00:53.891
He managed to swim to safety and was rescued by a boat.

00:54.486 --> 00:55.994
But many others were not so lucky.

00:58.505 --> 01:01.535
I believe many lost their lives as they swam towards the mainland.

01:02.482 --> 01:03.727
Some hid behind rocks.

01:04.815 --> 01:07.953
I felt it was best to stay quiet, not to run into the open.

01:08.461 --> 01:09.897
I saw people getting shot.

01:12.203 --> 01:15.528
As the death toll from the twin shooting and bomb attacks rises,...

01:15.958 --> 01:18.322
...rescuers continue their search for victims.

01:20.429 --> 01:22.836
My thoughts are with the people who have been wounded...

01:23.071 --> 01:25.353
...and with the families of those of who have lost their lives.

01:26.175 --> 01:29.027
I have ensured everything possible is done to help the victims,...

01:29.179 --> 01:30.914
...especially those in a critical condition.

01:32.784 --> 01:37.964
The police and rescuers are doing a fantastic job and we need to support them in this crucial task.

01:40.063 --> 01:44.309
The Norwegian capital is a well - known symbol of international peace efforts.

01:44.797 --> 01:46.169
It is home to the Nobel Peace...

01:46.292 --> 01:50.983
...Prize and the birthplace of the 1993 Israeli - Palestinian Oslo Accords.

01:53.260 --> 01:55.531
I can't believe it. I'm shocked, very shocked.

01:57.667 --> 01:59.495
It's something you don't expect to happen in Oslo.

02:00.567 --> 02:02.625
Residents are struggling to come to terms with...

02:02.757 --> 02:06.172
...the idea that it is now the scene of Europe's deadliest carnage...

02:06.236 --> 02:08.635
...since the 2004 Madrid bombings.
