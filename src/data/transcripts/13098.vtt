Are you excited to be nominated for Sportswoman of the Year?

00:05.344 --> 00:12.323
Yeah, actually I had no chance to meet other sportswoman athletes...

00:12.603 --> 00:18.045
...but it's the first time to meet all the wonderful champions and athletes.

00:18.148 --> 00:25.219
So, I'm so excited and I hope I can have a lot of opportunity to meet them again.

00:27.478 --> 00:30.815
Do you feel comfortable now that you're in Los Angeles?

00:30.961 --> 00:32.579
Does it feel like home?

00:33.726 --> 00:39.260
It's been a month training in Los Angeles and with my new coach...

00:39.469 --> 00:41.253
...and new skaters and at the new rink.

00:41.387 --> 00:50.867
So, I'm very excited to be in a new place and training center.

00:50.988 --> 00:53.583
So yeah, I'm having fun, a lot of fun.

00:55.496 --> 00:58.696
What do you like the best about Peter Oppegard?

00:59.269 --> 01:00.172
Why do you like him?

01:01.351 --> 01:05.125
Well, it's been only a few days to work with him...

01:05.795 --> 01:11.123
...but he's very calm and collected so I really love working with him.

01:11.459 --> 01:17.095
And I hope I can really ready for the next competition very well.

01:17.949 --> 01:19.839
Who do you admire in skating?

01:19.948 --> 01:26.117
Specially, Michelle. She has been my role model since I was young.

01:26.545 --> 01:32.538
And now, I have a lot of opportunity to meet Michelle and skate with her.

01:32.682 --> 01:39.585
So, I had a lot of fun last week with her in the show.

01:39.880 --> 01:46.333
So, I love being with her and I'm so honored to be performing with her.

01:48.253 --> 01:53.589
What advice would you give to little girls who wanna be just like you?

01:54.393 --> 01:57.595
Because it's a lot of hard work and a lot of sacrifices.

01:58.787 --> 02:06.311
Yeah, I've been watching Michelle and other, a lot of skaters' performances.

02:06.775 --> 02:15.539
And I was inspired by other wonderful champions.

02:15.634 --> 02:25.952
So, I hope many young skaters get inspired by me, as I was inspired by Michelle.
