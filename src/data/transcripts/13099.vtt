In October of '05, after those first seven loans were paid,...

00:04.656 --> 00:07.530
...Matt and I took the word "beta" off of the site. We said,...

00:07.639 --> 00:11.131
..."Our little experiment has been a success. Let's start for real." That was our official launch.

00:11.594 --> 00:16.193
And then that first year, October '05 through '06, Kiva facilitated $500,000 in loans.

00:16.735 --> 00:20.160
The second year, it was a total of 15 million. The third year,...

00:20.710 --> 00:22.051
...the total was up to around 40.

00:22.105 --> 00:24.027
The fourth year, we were just short of 100.

00:24.435 --> 00:29.455
And today, less than five years in, Kiva's facilitated more than 150 million dollars...

00:29.555 --> 00:30.795
...in little 25-dollar bits...

00:31.089 --> 00:34.563
...from lenders and entrepreneurs; more than a million of those collectively in 200 countries.

00:35.115 --> 00:37.706
That's where Kiva is today, just to bring you right up to the present.

00:38.059 --> 00:39.969
And while those numbers and those statistics...

00:40.058 --> 00:42.220
...are really fun to talk about and they're interesting,...

00:43.069 --> 00:49.551
...to me, Kiva's really about stories. It's about retelling the story of the poor.

00:50.331 --> 00:55.952
And it's about giving ourselves an opportunity to engage that validates their dignity,...

00:56.271 --> 00:59.973
...validates a partnership relationship; not a relationship that's based on...

01:00.322 --> 01:03.986
...the traditional sort of donor beneficiary weirdness that can happen...

01:04.773 --> 01:08.897
...but instead a relationship that can promote respect and hope and...

01:11.232 --> 01:14.367
...this optimism that together, we can move forward.

01:15.011 --> 01:18.783
So what I hope is that, not only can the money keep flowing back and forth of Kiva,...

01:18.857 --> 01:22.105
...that's a very positive and meaningful thing; but I hope that Kiva can blur those lines...

01:22.198 --> 01:26.292
...like I said, between the traditional rich and poor categories...

01:26.382 --> 01:27.201
...that we're taught to see in the world;...

01:27.266 --> 01:29.783
...this false dichotomy of us and them, have and have not.

01:30.157 --> 01:31.566
I hope that Kiva can blur those lines...

01:32.147 --> 01:33.245
...because as that happens,...

01:33.309 --> 01:36.816
...I think we can feel free to interact in a way that's more open,...

01:37.268 --> 01:40.834
...more just and more creative; to engage with each other and to help each other.

01:41.927 --> 01:47.415
Imagine how you feel when you see somebody on the street who is begging...

01:47.599 --> 01:49.551
...and you're about to approach them. Imagine how you feel.

01:50.301 --> 01:53.545
And then imagine the difference when you might see somebody who has a story...

01:53.678 --> 01:58.917
...of entrepreneurship and hard work who wants to tell you about their business.

01:58.999 --> 02:01.896
Maybe they're smiling and they want to talk to you about what they've done.

02:02.536 --> 02:06.115
Imagine if you're speaking with somebody who's growing things and making them flourish.

02:07.107 --> 02:11.072
Somebody who's using their talents to do something productive.

02:12.115 --> 02:14.725
Somebody who's built their own business from scratch.

02:15.359 --> 02:20.510
Someone who is surrounded by abundance, not scarcity; who's in fact creating abundance.

02:21.136 --> 02:24.289
Somebody with full hands with something to offer,...

02:24.508 --> 02:27.942
...not empty hands asking for you to give them something.

02:28.577 --> 02:31.205
Imagine if you could hear a story you didn't expect...

02:31.500 --> 02:32.481
...of somebody who wakes up every day...

02:32.555 --> 02:35.117
...and works very, very hard to make their life better.
