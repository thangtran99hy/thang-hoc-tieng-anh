00:04.831 --> 00:09.054
The most powerful element of selling is actually asking.

00:09.883 --> 00:12.014
So if you know that questions are critical,...

00:13.127 --> 00:17.219
...why are you spending more time watching TV reruns than you are developing new questions?

00:18.229 --> 00:19.749
Note, I just asked you a question.

00:21.508 --> 00:26.068
If you know that questions are critical, why don't you have a list of 25 questions...

00:26.659 --> 00:30.365
...that you're certain that your prospect has not heard before....

00:30.461 --> 00:33.919
...and more certain, that your competition is not asking.

00:35.113 --> 00:37.149
The more thought - provoking your questions,...

00:37.571 --> 00:40.039
...the more your prospective buyer will respect you.

00:40.967 --> 00:42.835
The higher that respect level is,...

00:43.107 --> 00:45.729
...the more likely they are to be truthful with you...

00:46.197 --> 00:49.927
...and give you insight into the key factors that will determine the sale,...

00:51.037 --> 00:52.747
...their key buying motives.

00:53.425 --> 00:58.050
They will also begin to share truth about how the decision is made,...

00:58.204 --> 00:59.033
...not who makes it,...

00:59.530 --> 01:01.215
...how the decision is made.

01:01.722 --> 01:06.609
Every minute you're in front of a prospect, they're deciding how much they like you,...

01:06.891 --> 01:09.734
...how much they believe you, how much they respect you,...

01:10.035 --> 01:13.213
...how much confidence they have in you and how much they trust you.

01:14.455 --> 01:16.321
You know, you're trying to qualify the prospect,...

01:16.715 --> 01:17.209
...guess what?

01:17.759 --> 01:19.378
They're qualifying you.

01:20.095 --> 01:25.617
And all of these factors determine whether or not they're going to buy from you.

01:26.091 --> 01:27.536
A sale will always be made.

01:27.965 --> 01:29.407
Either you sell them on "yes"...

01:29.866 --> 01:32.012
...or they sell you on "no".
