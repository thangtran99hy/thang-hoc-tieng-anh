00:07.823 --> 00:11.395
The only thing harder than being the world's top spy...

00:12.701 --> 00:14.020
...is keeping the secret...

00:14.103 --> 00:15.317
I have to go on an important mission...

00:15.499 --> 00:16.437
...I mean, errand.

00:16.549 --> 00:17.637
...from her kids.

00:17.740 --> 00:19.468
There's something she's hiding from us.

00:20.941 --> 00:22.079
Frank, we've been set up.

00:23.262 --> 00:24.524
Who the heck are these guys?

00:25.892 --> 00:27.455
Enter the panic room now.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.917
Hello children, I'm a spy.

00:31.157 --> 00:31.967
This is a prank.

00:32.118 --> 00:33.223
This is not a prank.

00:34.322 --> 00:35.343
The dog is talking.

00:35.523 --> 00:36.425
Give me five.

00:37.047 --> 00:38.864
Sentry mode, attack mode?

00:39.163 --> 00:40.655
You better keep it in sentry mode.

00:41.446 --> 00:41.884
Now...

00:41.996 --> 00:44.781
I am taking all of the time in the world...

00:46.098 --> 00:47.055
...from you.

00:47.550 --> 00:49.149
...when the world needs saving,...

00:49.550 --> 00:51.454
This is the spy kids division.

00:51.599 --> 00:52.127
Whoa!

00:52.755 --> 00:53.552
The power...

00:53.775 --> 00:54.383
Where are the kids?

00:54.489 --> 00:54.835
Napping.

00:55.554 --> 00:57.109
...is in their hands.

00:58.825 --> 00:59.598
Where are they really?

01:00.343 --> 01:01.133
This summer,...

01:04.081 --> 01:05.340
...you get the action.

01:08.688 --> 01:09.933
You get the adventure.

01:10.158 --> 01:11.260
I'm gonna hurl.

01:11.383 --> 01:13.375
Right. Puke goes in the bag, not on my fur.

01:15.125 --> 01:16.367
You get the 3D.

01:21.849 --> 01:24.147
And you get one more dimension:...

01:24.815 --> 01:28.133
...4D Aromascope for free...

01:28.369 --> 01:29.213
What is that smell?

01:29.537 --> 01:31.511
...with your free aromascope card.

01:35.035 --> 01:35.998
Fire up your gadgets.

01:39.841 --> 01:41.349
Kids are gonna flip when they see this.

01:41.890 --> 01:44.351
Spy Kids: All the Time in the World.

01:44.427 --> 01:45.939
Why are you not doing something?

01:46.163 --> 01:47.071
Attack mode!

01:47.829 --> 01:48.618
Activated.

01:53.491 --> 01:54.527
I love doing that.

01:55.217 --> 01:57.803
August 19 in 4D.
