00:01.238 --> 00:01.931
Growing Up.

00:02.383 --> 00:04.415
Everybody has a fear about growing up.

00:04.627 --> 00:07.733
It's all a part of the growing up process.

00:08.084 --> 00:10.194
But what exactly do we fear?

00:10.517 --> 00:12.713
The thought of going to a new school.

00:13.039 --> 00:15.029
Making big decisions.

00:15.313 --> 00:17.073
Leaving friends behind.

00:17.158 --> 00:19.311
Being left behind.

00:19.592 --> 00:24.357
Wearing a tie or simply not knowing what will happen next.

00:24.646 --> 00:26.450
We all have these fears.

00:26.867 --> 00:30.128
Unfortunately, they don't go away when you get older.

00:30.507 --> 00:32.391
Actually, it only gets worse.

00:32.678 --> 00:36.418
The bigger you get, the fewer places there are to hide.

00:36.685 --> 00:39.214
Life will set in and pile up on you.

00:39.323 --> 00:41.318
There'll be more responsibilities,...

00:41.640 --> 00:42.737
...more work to do,...

00:42.870 --> 00:44.593
...more pressure to succeed.

00:44.962 --> 00:45.615
Growing up.

00:45.887 --> 00:50.517
The world is a cold and scary place filled with the unknown.

00:51.197 --> 00:53.141
But hey! It's not that bad.

00:53.583 --> 00:58.324
It's also filled with amazing things and awesome adventures.

00:58.492 --> 01:01.150
The older you get, the more you'll experience.

01:01.612 --> 01:04.978
You meet new people, make new friends,...

01:05.085 --> 01:10.181
...doors will open, leading you to new worlds and exciting opportunities.

01:10.417 --> 01:13.853
Embrace the joy of not knowing what will happen next.

01:13.946 --> 01:16.383
Life is supposed to be a surprise.

01:16.640 --> 01:19.566
There's no reason to resent getting older.

01:19.945 --> 01:22.529
It would be boring if we stayed the same forever.

01:22.873 --> 01:24.864
Don't worry too much about growing up.

01:25.163 --> 01:27.984
After all, how else will you reach the cookie jar?
