00:09.886 --> 00:11.131
You and I got a lot in common.

00:11.467 --> 00:13.730
Really? You're sitting there tied to a chair...

00:14.083 --> 00:15.952
...and I'm standing here with a gun in my hand.

00:16.529 --> 00:18.575
War isn't over 'til both sides say it is.

00:29.889 --> 00:30.319
Hello?

00:30.691 --> 00:31.718
I knew I'd find you.

00:32.047 --> 00:33.101
How did you get this number?

00:33.257 --> 00:35.154
You have no idea who you're messing with.

00:36.112 --> 00:37.433
He's like a father to you, right?

00:38.294 --> 00:39.855
You don't do this, he's a dead man.

00:41.540 --> 00:43.267
Listen, Danny's gonna come back for me...

00:44.273 --> 00:46.146
...and when he does, you're out of here.

00:46.987 --> 00:48.008
And he's your worst nightmare.

00:50.847 --> 00:52.723
All we gotta do is wait for him to come to us.

01:05.101 --> 01:05.875
This guy is good.

01:06.037 --> 01:07.571
You have no idea.

01:26.747 --> 01:27.246
What are you doin'?

01:27.338 --> 01:28.219
Let me get my watch back.

01:30.655 --> 01:31.463
You should have stayed away.

01:31.693 --> 01:32.273
The gloves are off.

01:32.428 --> 01:33.375
This ends today.
