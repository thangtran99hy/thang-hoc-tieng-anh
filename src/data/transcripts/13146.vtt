A few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a rut...

00:04.979 --> 00:09.971
...so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock,...

00:10.629 --> 00:12.552
...and try something new for 30 days.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.033
The idea is actually pretty simple.

00:15.624 --> 00:18.436
Think about something you've always wanted to add to your life...

00:18.753 --> 00:21.013
...and try it for the next 30 days.

00:21.836 --> 00:25.020
It turns out, 30 days is just about the right amount of time...
