00:04.623 --> 00:06.577
The History of English in Ten Minutes.

00:06.846 --> 00:10.094
Chapter Two: The Norman Conquest or Excuse My English.

00:11.001 --> 00:14.422
1066. True to his name, William the Conqueror invades England,...

00:14.686 --> 00:16.399
...bringing new concepts from across the channel,...

00:16.551 --> 00:20.625
...like the French language, the Doomsday Book and the duty-free Galois's multipack.

00:21.017 --> 00:23.115
French was "de rigueur" for all official business,...

00:23.256 --> 00:25.533
...with words like "judge," "jury," "evidence" and "justice"...

00:25.857 --> 00:28.274
...coming in and giving John Grisham's career a kick-start.

00:28.748 --> 00:32.691
Latin was still used "ad nauseam" in church, but the common man spoke English,...

00:32.847 --> 00:37.050
...able to communicate only by speaking more slowly and loudly until the others understood him.

00:37.662 --> 00:41.109
Words like "cow," "sheep" and "swine" come from the English-speaking farmers.

00:41.427 --> 00:43.889
While the "a la carte" versions: "beef," "mutton" and "pork"...

00:44.195 --> 00:45.620
...come from the French-speaking toffs,...

00:46.041 --> 00:49.679
...beginning a long-running trend of restaurants having completely indecipherable menus.

00:50.250 --> 00:53.404
All in all, the English absorbed about ten thousand new words from the Normans,...

00:53.737 --> 00:55.762
...though they still couldn't grasp the rules of cheek kissing.

00:56.254 --> 00:59.709
The "bonhomie" all ended when the English nation took their new warlike lingo of...

00:59.972 --> 01:04.137
..."armies," "navies" and "soldiers" and began the Hundred Years' War against France.

01:04.597 --> 01:06.167
It actually lasted 116 years,...

01:06.272 --> 01:08.361
...but by that point, no one could count any higher in French...

01:08.645 --> 01:10.850
...and English took over as the language of power.
