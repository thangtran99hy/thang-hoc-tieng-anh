The History of English in Ten Minutes.

00:06.867 --> 00:09.956
Chapter 3: Shakespeare or a Plaque on Both His Houses.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.093
As the dictionary tells us, about...

00:12.251 --> 00:15.672
...2000 new words and phrases were invented by William Shakespeare.

00:16.051 --> 00:18.998
He gave us handy words like "eyeball," "puppy dog" and "anchovy"...

00:19.329 --> 00:22.654
...and more show-offy words like "dauntless," "besmirch" and "lacklustre"...

00:22.961 --> 00:26.485
He came up with the word "alligator" soon after he ran out of things to rhyme with "crocodile."

00:26.929 --> 00:29.621
And a nation of tea drinkers finally took him to their hearts...

00:29.923 --> 00:31.119
...when he invented the "hobnob."

00:31.648 --> 00:34.679
Shakespeare knew the power of catchphrases as well as biscuits.

00:35.009 --> 00:38.625
Without him we'd never eat our "flesh and blood" "out of house and home."

00:38.922 --> 00:42.252
We'd have to say "good riddance" to the "green-eyed monster" and "breaking the ice"...

00:42.504 --> 00:43.711
...would be as "dead as a doornail."

00:44.083 --> 00:46.581
If you tried to get your "money's worth," you'd be given "short shrift"...

00:46.761 --> 00:49.943
...and anyone who "laid it on with a trowel" could be "hoist with his own petard."

00:50.233 --> 00:52.951
Of course, it's possible other people used these words first,...

00:53.303 --> 00:55.587
...but the dictionary writers liked looking them up in Shakespeare...

00:55.839 --> 00:58.813
...because there was more "cross-dressing" and people "poking" each other's eyes out.

00:59.162 --> 01:03.151
Shakespeare's poetry showed the world that English was a rich, vibrant language...

01:03.377 --> 01:05.552
...with limitless expressive and emotional power,...

01:05.827 --> 01:08.111
...and he still had time to open all of those tea rooms in Stratford.
