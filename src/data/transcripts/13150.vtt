00:06.971 --> 00:11.807
Chapter Six: English and Empire or The Sun Never Sets on the English Language.

00:12.733 --> 00:16.053
With English making its name as the language of science, the Bible and Shakespeare,...

00:16.477 --> 00:18.343
...Britain decided to take it on tour...

00:18.695 --> 00:21.102
...asking only for land, wealth, natural resources,...

00:21.219 --> 00:24.178
...total obedience to the Crown and a few local words in return.

00:24.809 --> 00:27.770
They went to the Caribbean looking for gold and a chance to really unwind,...

00:28.145 --> 00:31.480
...discovering the "barbecue," the "canoe" and a pretty good recipe for rum punch.

00:31.777 --> 00:34.776
They also brought back the word "cannibal" to make their trip sound more exciting.

00:35.209 --> 00:36.547
In India, there was something for everyone.

00:36.889 --> 00:39.847

00:43.109 --> 00:45.613

00:45.985 --> 00:46.725
...they had the "bungalow."

00:47.195 --> 00:50.014

00:50.381 --> 00:51.729
...kicking off the teen horror film.

00:52.359 --> 00:56.011
From Australia, English took the words "nugget," "boomerang" and "walkabout"...

00:56.336 --> 00:58.385
...and in fact, the whole concept of chain pubs.

00:58.936 --> 01:01.698
All in all, between toppling Napoleon and the First World War,...

01:01.960 --> 01:05.035
...the British Empire gobbled up around ten million square miles,...

01:05.312 --> 01:08.815
...four hundred million people and nearly a hundred thousand gin and tonics,...

01:09.130 --> 01:12.207
...leaving new varieties of English to develop all over the globe.
