00:03.191 --> 00:07.109
There are many things to see in this photograph.

00:08.181 --> 00:10.378
Do you know what is happening?

00:11.245 --> 00:13.719
Yes, they are shopping.

00:14.682 --> 00:18.217
This dad is buying something for his son.

00:19.114 --> 00:21.745
Can you figure out what it is?

00:22.746 --> 00:26.575
I think that he is holding a bag of diapers.

00:27.597 --> 00:32.536
Wow, there are many different diapers to choose from.

00:33.655 --> 00:38.581
I wonder how much money a bag of diapers costs.

00:39.477 --> 00:40.385
Do you know?

00:41.464 --> 00:44.418
The little boy has a nice jacket.

00:45.405 --> 00:48.649
Do you see the sunshine on his jacket?

00:49.729 --> 00:51.473
Look very closely.

00:52.247 --> 00:56.203
What kind of ball is on his green shirt?

00:57.031 --> 01:02.033
Maybe he can find a new soccer ball at this store too.

01:02.776 --> 01:06.241
Well, time to go pay for the diapers.
