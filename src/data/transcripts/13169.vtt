Who is this funny guy?

00:04.268 --> 00:05.078
Where is he?

00:05.854 --> 00:06.778
What is he doing?

00:07.975 --> 00:11.531
He has big glasses and a big bag of popcorn.

00:12.806 --> 00:14.044
Oh, I know!

00:14.407 --> 00:15.919
He is at the movie theatre!

00:16.785 --> 00:18.873
I wonder which movie he is watching?

00:19.743 --> 00:22.638
Maybe it's a scary or funny movie.

00:23.645 --> 00:26.455
I think that he is watching a special movie.

00:27.151 --> 00:29.833
He is wearing special 3D glasses.

00:30.818 --> 00:33.760
Have you watched the megahit film Avatar?

00:34.531 --> 00:38.378

00:39.390 --> 00:42.209
Hey, is he going to share that popcorn?

00:43.041 --> 00:44.801
Popcorn makes me thirsty.

00:45.575 --> 00:47.873
Maybe he will share his drink with me.

00:48.587 --> 00:50.651
Shh, please be quiet.

00:51.107 --> 00:53.106
We're trying to watch the movie.
