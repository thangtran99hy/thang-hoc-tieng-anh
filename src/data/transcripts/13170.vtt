Yummy! Who likes fast food?

00:06.455 --> 00:07.776
Are you hungry?

00:08.575 --> 00:11.687
What is your favorite McDonald's meal?

00:12.477 --> 00:15.518
I like their Big Macs and milk shakes.

00:16.405 --> 00:19.087
What are these people eating today?

00:20.233 --> 00:24.983
You can see a Big Mac, McNuggets, two cokes,...

00:25.368 --> 00:28.963
...two bags of French fries, and a corn cup.

00:29.731 --> 00:31.388
Did we miss anything?

00:32.171 --> 00:36.951
Yes, you can also see ketchup and curry sauce.

00:38.076 --> 00:40.948
Do you prefer using the drive-thru,...

00:41.459 --> 00:44.863
...or would you rather sit inside the restaurant?

00:45.896 --> 00:51.557
People around the world recognize McDonald's golden letter "M".

00:52.575 --> 00:55.053
The first McDonald's restaurant...

00:55.427 --> 01:01.994
...was opened by two brothers in 1940, in California, USA.

01:03.244 --> 01:06.094
Do you think that the McDonald brothers...

01:06.305 --> 01:09.585
...thought their food would become so popular?

01:10.255 --> 01:10.962
Wow!
