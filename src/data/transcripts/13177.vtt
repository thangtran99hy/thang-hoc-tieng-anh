There is something amazing in the sky today.

00:06.909 --> 00:07.965
Do you see it?

00:08.655 --> 00:10.010
It's a rainbow.

00:10.821 --> 00:15.051
When the sun is shining and there is rain as well,...

00:15.591 --> 00:18.780
...you may see a rainbow in the sky!

00:19.780 --> 00:23.025
Wow, there are two rainbows.

00:23.852 --> 00:27.080
Can you count all the colors of the rainbow?

00:27.871 --> 00:29.833
Go ahead and try it.

00:30.794 --> 00:33.260
Rainbows have seven colors.

00:33.971 --> 00:41.601
They are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.

00:42.597 --> 00:44.904
Which color is your favorite?

00:45.909 --> 00:49.217
I really like the green in this rainbow.

00:50.387 --> 00:52.087
What makes a rainbow?

00:52.933 --> 00:55.894
Sunlight and water make rainbows.

00:56.801 --> 01:02.357
Black is an absence of light, so it is not in the rainbow.

01:03.399 --> 01:07.209
Have you ever tried to find the end of a rainbow?

01:08.099 --> 01:11.111
I have tried but I couldn't find it.

01:11.793 --> 01:14.134
It is a beautiful mystery.
