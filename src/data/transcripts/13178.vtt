00:03.083 --> 00:04.315
Good morning!

00:04.815 --> 00:06.348
It's time for school.

00:07.004 --> 00:09.927
Grab your school bag and hurry up.

00:10.556 --> 00:13.665
The school bus is coming to pick us up.

00:14.517 --> 00:15.621
Do you see it?

00:16.347 --> 00:17.581
What color is it?

00:18.300 --> 00:20.159
Yes, it's yellow.

00:21.095 --> 00:24.225
Do you know why school buses are yellow?

00:25.391 --> 00:29.848
Yellow gets your attention faster than any other color.

00:31.005 --> 00:33.753
People notice yellow objects first.

00:34.633 --> 00:36.565
That's why they are yellow.

00:37.532 --> 00:41.485
Wow, there are lots of seats on our bus.

00:42.295 --> 00:44.920
The kids are excited for school.

00:45.708 --> 00:48.389
Sometimes we sing on the bus.

00:49.401 --> 00:52.437
What do you like to do on a school bus?

00:53.401 --> 00:57.847
Oh, look at the red stop sign on the bus.

00:58.802 --> 01:04.626
It is telling other cars to stop for the kids to get on the bus.

01:05.729 --> 01:08.643
Our bus driver is very friendly.

01:09.623 --> 01:13.506
He picks us up at the same time every day.

01:14.355 --> 01:16.342
He drops us off, too.

01:17.319 --> 01:19.333
Let's get on the bus!
