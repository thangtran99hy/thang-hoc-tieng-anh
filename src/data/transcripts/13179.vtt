00:03.118 --> 00:05.262
This is an interesting photograph.

00:06.016 --> 00:07.567
Where do you think this is?

00:08.379 --> 00:09.303
Take a guess.

00:10.255 --> 00:12.809
That's right, we're on an airplane.

00:13.685 --> 00:17.325
I think we are on a 747 jumbo jet.

00:18.310 --> 00:22.344
Look closely, can you find the number 747?

00:23.521 --> 00:25.764
Great job, you found it!

00:26.410 --> 00:30.233
It's on the cover of the magazine in the seat ahead.

00:31.444 --> 00:33.739
Some plane rides are very long.

00:34.565 --> 00:35.509
You will get hungry.

00:36.015 --> 00:37.218
It's time to eat.

00:38.149 --> 00:41.345
Wow, look at all the food we get to eat today.

00:43.021 --> 00:45.005
I see some chicken and rice.

00:46.245 --> 00:49.409
Oh, there is some seafood and salad, too.

00:50.463 --> 00:53.054
Look, we have apple juice to drink.

00:54.005 --> 00:55.027
What's for dessert?

00:56.131 --> 01:00.199
Hmm, it seems some kind of pudding or yogurt.

01:01.133 --> 01:02.386
Did I miss anything?

01:03.503 --> 01:08.139
It is amazing how the airplane food is packed into small containers.

01:09.229 --> 01:11.831
I wonder if everyone gets the same meal.

01:12.817 --> 01:13.597
Let's eat.
