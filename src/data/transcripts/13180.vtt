00:04.213 --> 00:05.412
Watch out everyone!

00:06.075 --> 00:08.018
Don't get too close to these people.

00:08.912 --> 00:09.823
What are they doing?

00:10.508 --> 00:11.364
Are they fighting?

00:12.301 --> 00:14.555
Why are they wearing the same clothes?

00:15.453 --> 00:18.365
Yes, they are practicing Taekwondo together.

00:19.247 --> 00:20.910
Is everyone the same age?

00:21.845 --> 00:27.519
I see belts that are red, green, orange, yellow and white.

00:28.547 --> 00:31.772
Wow, what do those special colors mean?

00:32.919 --> 00:37.457
Each color represents the different skill level achieved by that person.

00:38.330 --> 00:42.401
Taekwondo is a martial art sport invented by Koreans.

00:43.925 --> 00:46.727
It is the most popular martial art in the world.

00:47.890 --> 00:53.463
More people do Taekwondo than other martial arts, like Karate and Judo.

00:54.487 --> 00:58.988
The word, Taekwondo, means "the way of the foot and fist"

00:59.630 --> 01:02.511
or "the way of kicking and punching."

01:03.481 --> 01:05.339
It really looks like fun.
