00:02.651 --> 00:04.090
Who wants cake?

00:04.416 --> 00:06.090
I do, I do!

00:06.647 --> 00:09.531
I hope there is ice cream, don't you?

00:10.355 --> 00:13.045
Birthday parties are really fun.

00:13.587 --> 00:17.121
There are balloons and colorful party hats.

00:17.823 --> 00:22.092
These girls even have tiny umbrellas on their drinks.

00:23.199 --> 00:26.934
Can you hear them singing the Happy Birthday song?

00:28.041 --> 00:30.772
How many balloons can you count?

00:31.792 --> 00:34.073
I count nine balloons.

00:35.079 --> 00:38.085
How do the balloons float like that?

00:38.905 --> 00:41.923
If you guessed helium, you're right!

00:42.855 --> 00:45.098
Helium is lighter than air,...

00:45.648 --> 00:49.883
...so it makes the balloons float when it's inside them.

00:50.851 --> 00:54.695
Can you guess how old this birthday girl is today?

00:55.608 --> 00:57.745
I'll give you a little hint.

00:58.564 --> 01:01.683
Count the number of candles on the cake.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.135
Did you count six?

01:04.863 --> 01:06.063
Great job!

01:06.857 --> 01:11.288
Do you think that she'll blow all of them out with one try?

01:12.115 --> 01:12.827
I do.

01:13.599 --> 01:17.837
I hope that your next birthday party is fun, too.
