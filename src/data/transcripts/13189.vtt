Want to drop a couple of pounds quickly for a special occasion?

00:09.309 --> 00:11.717
Or jumpstart a slow and sensible weight loss plan?

00:12.117 --> 00:13.586
Get started with these tricks.

00:14.267 --> 00:17.071
You will need a restricted diet and willpower.

00:18.041 --> 00:20.433
Consult a doctor before embarking on any diet.

00:20.561 --> 00:25.173
People should not consume less than 1,200 calories per day without medical supervision.

00:26.115 --> 00:29.340
Step 1: Know the mathematics of losing weight.

00:29.443 --> 00:33.968
You must cut 3,500 calories from your food intake to drop one pound of fat.

00:34.184 --> 00:37.367
To do that, you have to eat fewer calories than you burn each day.

00:38.193 --> 00:41.551
For fastest results, go on a diet and exercise.

00:41.727 --> 00:44.261
You'll be restricting calories as well as burning them.

00:45.469 --> 00:48.051
Step 2: Limit your variety of foods.

00:48.157 --> 00:52.023
Some studies have indicated that more choices mean more calories consumed.

00:52.890 --> 00:55.283
Step 3: Try the milk and fruit diet.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.834
Have a cup of full fat milk for breakfast,...

00:58.068 --> 01:00.001
...any kind or amount of fruit for lunch.

01:00.165 --> 01:03.542
One or two cups of milk for dinner and unlimited fruits in between.

01:03.877 --> 01:07.382
The exception is bananas, which are high in sugar and starch.

01:08.491 --> 01:10.337
Step 4: Like eggs?

01:10.700 --> 01:11.871
Try this for three days.

01:12.471 --> 01:14.297
Two eggs and a piece of fruit for breakfast.

01:14.467 --> 01:18.251
Two egg whites and four ounces of boiled chicken, fish, or meat for lunch.

01:18.431 --> 01:20.415
And unlimited steamed vegetables for dinner.

01:21.341 --> 01:23.917
Step 5: Go on a liquid diet.

01:24.073 --> 01:26.844
Eat nothing but homemade soups and juices made from whole...

01:26.931 --> 01:29.561
...pureed fruits and vegetables for up to one week.

01:29.731 --> 01:31.676
Avoid commercial fruit juices and soups.

01:31.828 --> 01:35.714
They contain too much sugar and salt respectively to promote fast weight loss.

01:36.791 --> 01:40.705
Step 6: Don't beat yourself up if you can't stick to a crash diet.

01:41.013 --> 01:43.933
For most people, slow and steady is a better plan.

01:44.732 --> 01:45.333
Did you know?

01:45.486 --> 01:48.769
According to a Tufts University Nutrition and Psychiatry professor,...

01:48.909 --> 01:52.217
...people who are easily tempted by food can often better stick to a diet...

01:52.335 --> 01:55.779
...that cuts their daily calories by 30% than just 10%.
