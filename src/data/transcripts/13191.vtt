00:00.228 --> 00:02.186
The History of English in ten minutes.

00:02.417 --> 00:03.915
Chapter 1: Anglo-Saxon.

00:04.125 --> 00:05.575
Or "Whatever Happened to the Jutes?"

00:06.569 --> 00:10.341
The English language begins with the phrase "Up Yours Caesar!" as the Romans leave Britain.

00:10.549 --> 00:14.269
And a lot of Germanic tribes start flooding in, tribes such as the Angles and the Saxons...

00:14.432 --> 00:17.540
...who together gave us the term Anglo-Saxon, and the Jutes who didn't.

00:18.069 --> 00:21.990
The Romans left some very straight roads behind, but not much of their Latin language.

00:22.295 --> 00:24.916
The Anglo-Saxon vocab was much more useful...

00:25.088 --> 00:30.313
...as it was mainly words for simple everyday things like "house, ""woman," "loaf" and "werewolf."

00:30.730 --> 00:33.985
Four of our days of the week were named in honor of Anglo-Saxon gods.

00:34.451 --> 00:37.604
They didn't bother with Saturday, Sunday and Monday as they had all gone off for a long weekend.

00:38.138 --> 00:40.653
While they were away, Christian missionaries stole in...

00:40.782 --> 00:43.381
...bringing with them leaflets about jumble sales and more Latin.

00:43.951 --> 00:45.593
Christianity was a hit with the locals...

00:45.825 --> 00:48.719
...and made them much happier to take on funky new words from Latin...

00:48.949 --> 00:50.683
...like "martyr," "bishop" and "font."

00:51.308 --> 00:54.409
Along came the Vikings, with their action man words like...

00:54.533 --> 00:56.692
..."drag," "ransack," "thrust" and "die."

00:56.977 --> 01:00.238
They may have raped and pillaged but they were also into "give" and "take."

01:00.629 --> 01:02.984
Two of around 2000 words that they gave English,...

01:03.336 --> 01:06.410
...as well as the phrase "watch out for that man with the enormous axe."
