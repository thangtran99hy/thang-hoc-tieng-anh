Long ago, the lion went hunting along with fox, jackal and wolf.

00:18.619 --> 00:22.993
They made a promise that the spoil should be divided equally.

00:24.247 --> 00:28.144
They found a stag and killed it so they could eat it.

00:29.294 --> 00:35.107
The lion, because he was the king of beasts, said he should have it all.

00:37.607 --> 00:40.610
The others dared not challenge the lion.

00:41.451 --> 00:42.979
So they left, saying...

00:43.867 --> 00:48.772
...'The lion was willing to work with others but would not share the reward.'
