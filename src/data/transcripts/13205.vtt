00:02.659 --> 00:05.514
When is the coldest time of year?

00:06.042 --> 00:08.527
That's right, it's winter!

00:09.250 --> 00:11.927
Can we still go outside to play?

00:12.405 --> 00:18.803
No problem, there are many fun things to do outside in winter.

00:19.719 --> 00:23.256
What is your favorite thing to do in the snow?

00:23.879 --> 00:24.646
Skiing?

00:25.159 --> 00:25.907
Sledding?

00:26.380 --> 00:27.863
Snowball Fights?

00:28.702 --> 00:33.371
Put on your warm clothes and get ready for an adventure.

00:34.266 --> 00:38.205
What does this little girl like to do in the snow?

00:39.071 --> 00:43.077
That's right, she made a friendly snowman.

00:43.897 --> 00:48.589
It is hard work to roll up each big ball of snow.

00:49.689 --> 00:52.483
How many snowballs did she use?

00:53.392 --> 00:59.668
Can you guess what she used for his arms, nose, eyes and mouth?

01:00.751 --> 01:04.770
I count three big snowballs for his body.

01:05.551 --> 01:06.484
Oh, look!

01:06.877 --> 01:12.143
He has sticks for arms, marbles for his eyes and mouth,...

01:12.601 --> 01:14.903
...and a carrot for his nose.

01:15.864 --> 01:19.763
This snowman even has a hat and scarf.

01:20.837 --> 01:24.912
Does this snowman look happy with his new friend?

01:25.726 --> 01:28.236
Maybe his name is Frosty.
