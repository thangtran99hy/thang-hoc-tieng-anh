Do you know what this cool thing is?

00:06.327 --> 00:10.863
It is very small, but it can do many different things.

00:11.754 --> 00:13.463
It can be many things.

00:14.081 --> 00:21.201
It can be a computer, a camera, a phone, a movie player, and a music player.

00:22.262 --> 00:24.867
I wonder what some of those buttons are for.

00:25.891 --> 00:28.719
Touch the sunflower button to view photos.

00:29.623 --> 00:32.165
Listen to music with the iTunes button,...

00:32.862 --> 00:36.923
...or touch the button with the envelope to check your e-mail.

00:38.088 --> 00:39.304
It is iPhone.

00:39.852 --> 00:42.312
It is made by a company called Apple.

00:43.466 --> 00:47.040
iPhones came out in stores in 2007.

00:47.865 --> 00:49.647
They are very popular now.

00:50.807 --> 00:53.159
Do you know anyone who has an iPhone?

00:54.033 --> 00:55.517
Have you used one before?

00:56.320 --> 00:57.358
Is it difficult?

00:58.329 --> 01:00.369
Should I take my iPhone swimming?

01:00.977 --> 01:02.269
No way!

01:03.292 --> 01:08.217
iPhones are very fun, but they are not really a toy.

01:09.016 --> 01:13.369
They are expensive, so be very careful when you hold it.

01:14.372 --> 01:18.631
You are also small, and you can do many things.

01:19.469 --> 01:25.014
You are more amazing than an iPhone, so take good care of yourself.
