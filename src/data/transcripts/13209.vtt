Books are wonderful, aren't they?

00:06.290 --> 00:09.555
There are so many different kinds of books.

00:10.358 --> 00:14.944
Yes, their stories can take us to different places.

00:15.736 --> 00:19.002
Stories can teach us about many things.

00:19.915 --> 00:23.868
This little girl is reading a story with her dad.

00:24.759 --> 00:27.266
They are reading in a special room.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.709
Do you know what this room is called?

00:31.635 --> 00:34.237
You're right, it's a library.

00:35.183 --> 00:39.961
Libraries are filled with all kinds of wonderful books.

00:40.758 --> 00:43.714
There are books for adults and children.

00:44.672 --> 00:48.169
When you want to borrow a book from the library,...

00:48.879 --> 00:51.604
...make sure that you sign it out first.

00:52.663 --> 00:59.899
Many libraries now use automatic computer checkout to sign out your books.

01:00.613 --> 01:06.817
Oh, make sure that you remember to return your books before the due date,...

01:07.467 --> 01:10.258
...or you might have to pay a fine.

01:11.392 --> 01:14.552
What kind of story is this girl reading?

01:15.398 --> 01:20.006
Nice work, it's a Dora the Explorer story.

01:20.940 --> 01:24.191
Which kinds of stories do you like to read?

01:25.084 --> 01:27.374
I like adventure stories.

01:28.265 --> 01:31.266
Learning to read is very important,...

01:31.949 --> 01:36.447
...because reading unlocks the wonder inside a book.
