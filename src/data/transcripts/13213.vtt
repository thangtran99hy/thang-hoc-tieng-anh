00:02.855 --> 00:07.041
Elderly Matthew and Marilla were unmarried siblings.

00:07.603 --> 00:12.642
They lived on their farm, Green Gables, in Prince Edward Island, Canada.

00:13.475 --> 00:18.320
They decided to adopt an orphan boy to help with farm chores.

00:19.175 --> 00:24.291
The orphanage sent them an eleven - year - old girl, Anne Shirley, by mistake.

00:25.137 --> 00:29.887
She was talkative and happy but didn't have very good manners.

00:30.809 --> 00:34.052
Anne's best friend, Diana, got sick one day...

00:34.491 --> 00:37.672
...because Anne accidentally gave her some wine.

00:38.757 --> 00:43.985
Hoping to make Matthew and Marilla proud, Anne studied hard in school.

00:44.807 --> 00:47.751
As a result, she could go to high school...

00:48.149 --> 00:51.523
...and then university as a scholarship student.

00:54.026 --> 00:58.781
But Matthew died of a heart attack and Marilla was going blind.

00:59.650 --> 01:02.315
So Anne returned home to Green Gables,...

01:02.908 --> 01:07.183
...giving up her desire for a four - year university degree.

01:08.447 --> 01:12.555
Hearing of her decision, Anne's childhood rival Gilbert...

01:12.906 --> 01:16.759
...gave up his post as the teacher at Avonlea school.

01:17.435 --> 01:20.797
So Anne could teach there and cared for Marilla.

01:22.332 --> 01:27.542
Though her future path was narrowed, Anne thought cheerfully about her future.
