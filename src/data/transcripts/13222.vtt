00:11.007 --> 00:14.122
A fox was strolling through an orchard.

00:14.835 --> 00:18.010
He saw some grapes ripening on a vine.

00:18.991 --> 00:22.371
He thought the grapes would take away his thirst.

00:23.452 --> 00:30.555
The vine was very high so he jumped up, but he could not reach the grapes.

00:33.189 --> 00:41.044
Turning round again with a One, Two, Three, he jumped up, but with no luck.

00:41.611 --> 00:44.404
Again and again he tried.

00:45.004 --> 00:49.306
But at last he had to give it up and walked away,...

00:49.885 --> 00:53.783
...saying that the grapes were probably too sour.
