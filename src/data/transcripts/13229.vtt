00:00.421 --> 00:02.331
The History of English in 10 minutes.

00:02.608 --> 00:06.381
Chapter Four : The King James Bible or "let there be light" reading.

00:07.223 --> 00:10.798
In 1611, the powers that be turned the world upside down...

00:10.939 --> 00:13.653
...with a labor of love, a new translation of the bible.

00:14.135 --> 00:17.059
A team of scribes with the wisdom of Solomon went the extra mile...

00:17.261 --> 00:20.134
...to make King James's translation "all things to all men"...

00:20.296 --> 00:21.625
...whether from their "heart's desire,"...

00:21.813 --> 00:24.707
..."to fight the good fight" or just for the "filthy lucre."

00:25.119 --> 00:29.102
This sexy new Bible "went from strength to strength" getting to the "root of the matter"...

00:29.307 --> 00:31.791
...in a language even the "salt of the earth" could understand.

00:32.230 --> 00:34.858
The "writing wasn't on the wall," it was in handy little books...

00:34.949 --> 00:37.753
...with "fire and brimstone" preachers reading it in every church.

00:37.989 --> 00:40.959
Its words and phrases took root to "the ends of the earth,"...

00:41.173 --> 00:42.330
...or at least the ends of Britain.

00:42.649 --> 00:44.879
The King James Bible is the book that taught us...

00:45.115 --> 00:46.733
...that "a leopard can't change its spots,"...

00:46.941 --> 00:48.835
...that "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,"...

00:49.111 --> 00:52.423
...that "a wolf in sheep's clothing" is harder to spot than you would imagine,...

00:52.586 --> 00:55.173
...and how annoying it is to have "a fly in your ointment."

00:55.531 --> 00:59.248
In fact, just as Jonathan begat Meribbaal and Meribbaal begat Micah,...

00:59.476 --> 01:02.245
...the King James Bible begat a whole glossary of metaphor...

01:02.456 --> 01:06.086
...and morality that still shapes the way English is spoken today.

01:06.619 --> 01:07.027
Amen.
