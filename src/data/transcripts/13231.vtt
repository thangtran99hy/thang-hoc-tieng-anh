The story begins with Ishmael heading out to find a whaling ship to join.

00:07.639 --> 00:11.897
On his way, he met a harpooning savage named Queequeg.

00:13.083 --> 00:15.127
The two became quick friends.

00:15.951 --> 00:18.795
They decided to sail on the ship Pequod.

00:20.035 --> 00:25.181
The ship's captain, Ahab, wished to hunt for the white whale called Moby Dick.

00:26.377 --> 00:30.599
The whale bit off Ahab's leg, so Ahab wanted revenge.

00:31.785 --> 00:34.686

The Pequod sailed over many seas, looking for Moby Dick.

00:47.796 --> 00:49.501
They finally found Moby Dick.

00:50.531 --> 00:52.892
Ahab was intent on killing the whale.

00:53.869 --> 00:56.985
The hunt began, and it lasted for three days.

00:57.867 --> 01:02.633
Eventually, the ship was sunk by the whale and the entire crew was killed,...

01:03.280 --> 01:04.398
...except for one.

01:05.356 --> 01:09.323
Only Ishmael survived, to be picked up by another vessel.

01:10.199 --> 01:12.729
Only he was left to tell the tale.
