The History of English in Ten Minutes.

00:02.670 --> 00:06.568
Chapter Five: The English of Science or How to Speak with Gravity.

00:07.465 --> 00:09.944
Before the 17th Century scientists weren't really recognized...

00:10.241 --> 00:12.201
...possibly because lab coats had yet to catch on.

00:12.523 --> 00:14.240
But suddenly Britain was full of physicists.

00:14.469 --> 00:16.012
There was Robert Hooke, Robert Boyle...

00:16.197 --> 00:18.456
...and even some people not called Robert, like Isaac Newton.

00:18.882 --> 00:21.791
The Royal Society was formed out of the Invisible College,...

00:22.013 --> 00:24.150
...after they put it down somewhere and couldn't find it again.

00:24.744 --> 00:26.071
At first, they worked in Latin.

00:26.374 --> 00:28.561
After sitting through Newton's story about the "pomum"...

00:28.781 --> 00:31.896
...falling to the "terra" from the "arbor" for the umpteenth time,...

00:32.151 --> 00:34.235
...the bright sparks realized they all spoke English...

00:34.463 --> 00:37.155
...and they could transform our understanding of the universe much quicker...

00:37.379 --> 00:38.745
...by talking in their own language.

00:39.232 --> 00:42.256
But science was discovering things faster than they could name them.

00:42.744 --> 00:47.021
Words like "acid," "gravity," "electricity" and "pendulum" had to be invented...

00:47.210 --> 00:49.980
...just to stop their meetings turning into an endless game of charades.

00:50.433 --> 00:54.101
Like teenage boys, the scientists suddenly became aware of the human body,...

00:54.395 --> 00:58.343
...coining new words like "cardiac" and "tonsil," "ovary" and "sternum."
