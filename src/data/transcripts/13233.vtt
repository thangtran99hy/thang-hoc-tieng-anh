00:02.181 --> 00:05.581
Frederic Henry was an American ambulance driver...

00:05.913 --> 00:09.209
...serving in the Italian army during World War I.

00:10.075 --> 00:13.619
He met Catherine Barkley, an English nurse's aide.

00:14.557 --> 00:20.052
Henry was wounded in battle and brought to a hospital in Milan to recover.

00:21.009 --> 00:24.147
Catherine joined him there, to help him get better.

00:25.063 --> 00:30.039
They soon passionately fell in love, and Catherine became pregnant.

00:32.853 --> 00:35.978
Henry was again sent to the front lines of battle.

00:36.701 --> 00:41.035
His troops were forced to retreat, and Henry was almost killed.

00:41.881 --> 00:46.705
He escaped from his unit and returned to Milan, looking for Catherine.

00:47.488 --> 00:51.475
He reunited with her in the town of Stresa in Italy.

00:52.181 --> 00:55.702
From there, they once again escaped to Switzerland...

00:56.153 --> 00:58.860
...where they could live happily and peacefully.

00:59.803 --> 01:01.863
Early one morning in the spring,...

01:02.479 --> 01:05.000
...Catherine went to the hospital to give birth.

01:05.990 --> 01:10.483
She delivered a stillborn baby boy and, later that night,...

01:10.975 --> 01:12.482
...died of a hemorrhage.

01:13.485 --> 01:16.541
Henry stayed at her side until she was gone.

01:17.343 --> 01:20.359
He walked back to his hotel in the rain.
