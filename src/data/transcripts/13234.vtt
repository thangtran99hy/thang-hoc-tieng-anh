00:10.225 --> 00:15.134
A lonely, young shepherd boy tended his sheep near a forest.

00:16.233 --> 00:23.320
One day, he shouted "Wolf, Wolf," and the villagers ran to help him.

00:24.429 --> 00:28.734
There was no wolf, but he enjoyed their company.

00:30.869 --> 00:33.609
He tried the same thing again later.

00:34.687 --> 00:38.935
Once again, the villagers came to help, in vain.

00:40.257 --> 00:43.654
But then a wolf really did attack his sheep.

00:44.450 --> 00:46.741
He cried "Wolf, Wolf,"...

00:47.971 --> 00:49.604
...but no one came to help.

00:50.514 --> 00:53.569
The villagers thought they were being fooled again.

00:54.401 --> 00:57.015
The wolf made a good meal of the flock.
