00:04.751 --> 00:06.727
The History of English in Ten Minutes.

00:06.979 --> 00:11.337
Chapter Seven: The Age of the Dictionary or the Definition of a Hopeless Task.

00:12.231 --> 00:13.987
With English expanding in all directions,...

00:14.160 --> 00:16.782
...along came a new breed of men called "lexicographers"...

00:16.990 --> 00:18.496
...who wanted to put an end to this anarchy.

00:18.723 --> 00:19.956
A word they defined as...

00:20.217 --> 00:23.123
..."What happens when people spell words slightly differently from each other?"

00:23.443 --> 00:24.965
One of the greatest was Dr. Johnson...

00:25.178 --> 00:28.109
...whose "Dictionary of the English Language" took him nine years to write.

00:28.425 --> 00:32.851
It was 18 inches tall and contained 42,773 entries...

00:33.237 --> 00:34.429
...meaning that even if you couldn't read,...

00:34.627 --> 00:37.135
...it was still pretty useful if you wanted to reach a high shelf.

00:37.543 --> 00:40.067
For the first time when people were calling you a "pickle-herring",...

00:40.275 --> 00:42.183
...a "jobbernowl" or a "fopdoodle",...

00:42.333 --> 00:43.886
...you could understand exactly what they meant.

00:44.033 --> 00:47.592
And you'd have the consolation of knowing they were all using the standard spelling.

00:47.917 --> 00:50.510
Try as he might to stop them, words kept being invented...

00:50.748 --> 00:54.818
...and in 1857, a new book was started that would become the Oxford English Dictionary.

00:55.153 --> 00:56.626
It took another 70 years to be finished...

00:56.691 --> 00:58.767
...after the first editor resigned to be an archbishop.

00:58.949 --> 01:01.603
The second died of TB and the third was so boring...

01:01.743 --> 01:04.551
...that half his volunteers quit and one of them ended up in an asylum.

01:04.929 --> 01:08.179
It eventually appeared in 1928 and has continued to be revised ever since,...

01:08.587 --> 01:12.006
...proving the whole idea that you can stop people from making up words is complete "snuffbumble".
