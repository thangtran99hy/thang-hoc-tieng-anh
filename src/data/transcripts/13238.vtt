00:02.136 --> 00:04.497
Lemuel Gulliver was an English surgeon.

00:05.599 --> 00:07.705
He went to sea when his business failed.

00:08.923 --> 00:10.406
He was shipwrecked in Lilliput,...

00:10.980 --> 00:14.161
...a land of tiny people where everything was much smaller.

00:15.198 --> 00:21.658
At first he was a prisoner, then he became a hero and then was wanted for treason.

00:22.803 --> 00:28.617
He escaped to the neighboring Blefuscu, where he repaired a boat and set sail for England.

00:29.815 --> 00:32.974
After staying in England with his family for two months,...

00:33.739 --> 00:35.784
...Gulliver undertook his next voyage.

00:36.325 --> 00:39.557
It took him to a land of giants called Brobdingnag.

00:40.477 --> 00:43.592
There he was captured by a farmer and became his pet.

00:44.475 --> 00:46.497
The farmer sold Gulliver to the queen.

00:47.658 --> 00:53.408
He eventually escaped from the giants when an eagle carried him away and dropped him in the sea.

00:54.270 --> 00:56.504
Next, Gulliver set sail again.

00:57.332 --> 01:02.199
After an attack by pirates, he ended up in Laputa, a floating island.

01:03.383 --> 01:07.031
The people there were very smart but out of touch with reality.

01:09.660 --> 01:12.844
His fourth and last journey took him to an unknown land.

01:14.117 --> 01:18.099
It was populated by Houyhnhnms which were rational thinking horses.

01:19.082 --> 01:24.080
Also, there were Yahoos, humanlike creatures who served the Houyhnhnms.

01:25.153 --> 01:26.819
He wanted to stay with the Houyhnhnms.

01:27.259 --> 01:32.029
But his bare body revealed to the horses that he was very much like a Yahoo.

01:33.177 --> 01:36.539
Consequently, he was banished and returned home to England.
