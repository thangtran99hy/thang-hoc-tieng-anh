Jane Eyre was a young orphan being raised by Mrs. Reed.

00:07.594 --> 00:10.441
Mrs. Reed was her cruel, wealthy aunt.

00:11.136 --> 00:13.763
She sent away Jane to Lowood School.

00:14.854 --> 00:20.265
A typhus epidemic went through Lowood and Jane's friend, Helen Burns, died.

00:21.189 --> 00:25.433
After completing school, she taught at Lowood for two years.

00:28.177 --> 00:34.766
Afterwards, she worked at Thornfield manor and tutored a lively French girl named Adele.

00:35.799 --> 00:40.217
Her boss was Rochester and Jane soon fell in love with him.

00:41.215 --> 00:43.172
Rochester proposed to Jane...

00:43.585 --> 00:47.665
...but, on their wedding day, she learned that he was already married.

00:48.741 --> 00:51.954
Rochester explained that his wife went mad.

00:52.820 --> 00:56.111
He had kept her hidden at his house for many years.

00:56.955 --> 00:59.777
In distress, Jane fled Thornfield.

01:01.727 --> 01:07.375
Penniless and hungry, Jane was forced to sleep outdoors and beg for food.

01:08.482 --> 01:10.979
Three siblings took Jane into their home.

01:11.923 --> 01:15.707
There she discovered that the siblings were her cousins...

01:16.269 --> 01:19.501
...and that she had inherited a large sum of money.

01:20.663 --> 01:26.265
Jane realized that she still loves Rochester and went back to Thornfield.

01:27.149 --> 01:30.950
But the Thornfield manor was burned to the ground by a fire.

01:32.087 --> 01:35.891
Rochester lost his eyesight and one of his hands,...

01:36.388 --> 01:38.675
...and his wife was killed in the fire.

01:39.787 --> 01:44.530
Rochester and Jane rebuilt their relationship and soon married.
