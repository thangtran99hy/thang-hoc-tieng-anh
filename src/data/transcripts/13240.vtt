00:01.905 --> 00:09.563
Lear, the aging king of Britain, decided to divide his kingdom evenly between his three daughters.

00:10.425 --> 00:13.844
First, however, he put his daughters through a test.

00:14.707 --> 00:18.035
He asked each to tell him how much she loves him.

00:18.982 --> 00:25.499
Goneril and Regan, his older daughters, gave him flattering but meaningless answers.

00:26.575 --> 00:29.631
Cordelia, the youngest and his favorite,...

00:30.187 --> 00:34.315
...said she had no words to describe how much she loves him.

00:35.411 --> 00:38.494
Lear was very angry and disowned her.

00:39.395 --> 00:43.509
So Cordelia went to France together with the king of France,...

00:44.003 --> 00:47.323
...who wanted to marry her even without her land.

00:50.037 --> 00:53.830
Lear quickly learned that he had made a bad decision.

00:54.749 --> 00:56.911
His older daughters had betrayed him.

00:57.731 --> 01:01.815
Lear went insane and fled to wander on a heath.

01:02.901 --> 01:08.324
An elderly nobleman named Gloucester was also having family problems.

01:09.074 --> 01:12.982
He too headed out on the heath and met King Lear.

01:13.761 --> 01:17.093
He decided to help Lear in spite of the danger.

01:17.888 --> 01:21.977
But Gloucester was captured, blinded and sent away.

01:23.008 --> 01:29.427
His son Edgar, in disguise, led Gloucester to Dover, where Lear had also gone.

01:30.429 --> 01:33.223
Cordelia, who had married the French king,...

01:33.704 --> 01:37.961
...led the French army to Dover in an effort to save her father.

01:38.979 --> 01:45.242
Edmond, Gloucester's illegitimate son, led the English army against Cordelia.

01:46.167 --> 01:48.401
Lear and Cordelia were captured.

01:49.402 --> 01:55.236
Cordelia was executed in prison and Lear died of grief over her death.
