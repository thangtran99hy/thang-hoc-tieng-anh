A king and a queen had a baby and named her Aurora.

00:07.558 --> 00:10.765
Many visitors came to see the baby,...

00:11.292 --> 00:14.038
...including three good fairies.

00:14.805 --> 00:19.242
Their names were Merryweather, Fauna and Flora.

00:20.388 --> 00:25.533
Another visitor was a king who brought his son, Prince Philip.

00:26.704 --> 00:33.049
A wicked fairy also visited and cast a bad spell on the baby.

00:34.019 --> 00:37.638
She said that Aurora would prick her finger...

00:37.956 --> 00:41.017
...on the needle of a spinning wheel and die.

00:43.617 --> 00:49.369
Fortunately, one of the good fairies was able to change the spell.

00:50.545 --> 00:54.567
Aurora would not die but only fall asleep.

00:55.660 --> 00:59.885
Only the kiss of her true love would wake her up.

01:00.919 --> 01:03.685
On the night of her 16th birthday,...

01:04.172 --> 01:07.645
...Aurora pricked her finger and fell asleep.

01:08.721 --> 01:11.917
Prince Philip kissed her and she woke up.
