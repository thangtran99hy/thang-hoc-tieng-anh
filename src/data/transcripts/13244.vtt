00:02.810 --> 00:04.946
Jack and his mother were hungry.

00:05.931 --> 00:07.754
They needed money to buy food,...

00:08.421 --> 00:11.086
...so they decided to sell their cow.

00:11.957 --> 00:15.617
But Jack traded the cow for a handful of beans.

00:16.551 --> 00:20.045
His mother was upset and threw them out the window.

00:22.863 --> 00:24.713
They grew high into the sky.

00:25.722 --> 00:29.665
Jack climbed up to the top and found a giant's castle.

00:30.760 --> 00:36.386
The giant had a magic hen and golden harp, which Jack took.

00:37.512 --> 00:42.531
He raced to the bottom of the beanstalk and cut it down with an ax.

00:43.682 --> 00:46.589
The giant fell from the beanstalk and was killed.

00:47.622 --> 00:50.871
The magic hen clucked and laid a golden egg.

00:52.011 --> 00:55.497
Jack's mother took the golden egg and said happily,...

00:56.384 --> 00:59.273
..."Now we'll have something nice to eat."
