00:03.629 --> 00:08.357
There was once a beautiful princess named Snow White.

00:09.307 --> 00:11.589
She had an evil stepmother...

00:12.085 --> 00:15.743
...who thought she was more beautiful than anyone else.

00:16.643 --> 00:19.339
But Snow White was more beautiful,...

00:19.989 --> 00:23.147
...so her stepmother tried to have her killed.

00:24.129 --> 00:26.679
Luckily, Snow White escaped...

00:27.112 --> 00:30.186
...and lived in the forest with seven dwarfs.

00:31.067 --> 00:36.244
They all lived happily, until the mirror told her stepmother...

00:36.576 --> 00:39.028
...that Snow White was still alive.

00:40.189 --> 00:44.757
The wicked stepmother disguised herself as a peddler.

00:45.797 --> 00:50.781
Then she went to the cottage while the seven dwarfs were at work.

00:51.849 --> 00:55.773
She gave Snow White a poisoned red apple.

00:56.719 --> 01:02.359
Snow White took a bite of the apple and fell into a deep sleep.

01:03.553 --> 01:09.116
The dwarfs were very sad and built a glass coffin for her.

01:11.987 --> 01:15.536
One day, a prince came by and saw her.

01:16.411 --> 01:19.158
He bent down to give her a kiss.

01:20.003 --> 01:23.407
Snow White woke up and they got married.
