00:03.878 --> 00:09.307
Long ago, there lived a lonely old carpenter named Geppetto.

00:10.109 --> 00:14.459
He made a puppet out of some wood, a ball, and a string.

00:15.189 --> 00:22.703
That night, a fairy visited and cast a spell that made the puppet walk and talk.

00:23.535 --> 00:26.044
Geppetto named him Pinocchio.

00:27.090 --> 00:33.855
Geppetto gave Pinocchio some money and sent him into town to buy schoolbooks.

00:34.689 --> 00:39.589
Instead, Pinocchio spent the money on a circus ticket.

00:40.568 --> 00:45.885
The fairy asked him what he did with the money and he lied to her.

00:46.673 --> 00:49.132
Suddenly, his nose grew.

00:50.080 --> 00:55.579
The fairy said, "Whenever you lie, your nose will get bigger."

00:56.299 --> 00:58.217
"Now go find Geppetto."

00:58.756 --> 01:01.381
"He's out looking for you by the sea."

01:04.255 --> 01:11.477
Pinocchio was rowing a small boat in the sea and found Geppetto inside a whale.

01:12.557 --> 01:16.956
Pinocchio made the whale sneeze and they escaped.

01:17.983 --> 01:22.063
Relieved, he promised to never lie again.

01:22.932 --> 01:30.675
The fairy said, "Keep that promise and I will turn you into a real boy."
