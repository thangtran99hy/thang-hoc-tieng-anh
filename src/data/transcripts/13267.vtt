00:00.730 --> 00:03.205
So how does it feel to score the winning goal against Liverpool?

00:04.156 --> 00:05.159
It was a great feeling,...

00:05.662 --> 00:09.233
...you know; it's like there'll be matches and very important games...

00:10.120 --> 00:12.538
...and scoring winning goals. I feel fantastic.

00:13.084 --> 00:15.779
And to do it at the Stratford end in front of the United fans,...

00:15.943 --> 00:17.451
...it must have been very special for you.

00:18.351 --> 00:21.483
Yes, of course at all times at different scores.

00:21.553 --> 00:26.109
And behind the fans, they acted as if it were unbelievable...

00:26.288 --> 00:29.460
...so it was a very happy feeling with that.

00:30.289 --> 00:34.644
And you only score in big games: Arsenal, A.C. Milan, and now Liverpool.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.889
Yes, but I want to score more goals.

00:41.625 --> 00:46.445
It doesn't matter who's against us but I should score more,...

00:46.581 --> 00:54.409
...but it's a good feeling against big teams like Arsenal and Liverpool. It's a great feeling.

00:55.532 --> 00:57.066
But I want to score more goals so that's what I need.

00:57.858 --> 01:01.650
You're playing in a slightly different position in midfield three.

01:01.765 --> 01:03.098
Do you enjoy playing there?

01:03.983 --> 01:08.543
Yes, I enjoy playing there because I had that experience before...

01:08.711 --> 01:11.500
...when I was in PSV Eindhoven and in the national team as well.

01:12.103 --> 01:16.859
So for me, it doesn't matter to play in the middle or either side.

01:17.555 --> 01:21.960
How important was it to win this game considering you were behind after just five minutes?

01:22.068 --> 01:23.300
So you had to come from behind to win?

01:24.594 --> 01:30.081
Yeah, it's very important because if we were the losing one nil and then we got over from that...

01:30.173 --> 01:34.493
...and then at the end of the game, we win two - one against Liverpool.

01:34.574 --> 01:37.541
It was a boost for us at best of the season,...

01:37.647 --> 01:41.073
...so we just have a seven league games left.

01:42.175 --> 01:44.922
And if we win seven games, then we win the title.

01:45.012 --> 01:48.121
So now, we just concentrate on our performances...

01:48.210 --> 01:51.083
...and we'll just keep up our level.

01:51.811 --> 01:54.168
Do you think it's gonna go to the very last day of the season...

01:54.284 --> 01:57.009
...because Arsenal and Chelsea keep winning as well?

01:57.989 --> 01:59.552
Yes, I think so.

02:00.202 --> 02:04.667
We just don't worry about Chelsea or Arsenal...

02:04.768 --> 02:13.381
...because if we win the last seven games, they can't win the title...

02:13.527 --> 02:21.155
...even if they win every game so that's the more important thing; so we just worry about our performances and our games.

02:21.544 --> 02:22.319
Well done today. Thank you.

02:22.391 --> 02:22.591
Thank you.
