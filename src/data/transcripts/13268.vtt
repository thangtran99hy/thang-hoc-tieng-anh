00:03.123 --> 00:06.845
Hansel and Gretel were the children of a poor woodcutter.

00:07.840 --> 00:09.687
Their family was very hungry...

00:10.254 --> 00:15.689
...so the stepmother convinced her husband to abandon the children in the forest.

00:17.111 --> 00:24.136
Hansel and Gretel heard her plan and gathered white pebbles to leave themselves a trail home.

00:25.442 --> 00:31.379
After their return, the stepmother again convinced her husband to abandon them.

00:32.371 --> 00:38.774
This time, however, they could only leave bread crumbs to mark a path back to their home.

00:40.193 --> 00:46.263
Unfortunately, the various animals of the woods ate their trail of bread crumbs.

00:47.226 --> 00:51.621
Lost in the forest, they found a house made of candies.

00:52.763 --> 00:54.189
An old woman lived there.

00:55.100 --> 01:00.643
She was a witch and fed them lots of food, to fatten them up and eat them.

01:03.566 --> 01:08.839
Days passed by, and Hansel grew very fat, as she wished.

01:10.083 --> 01:14.745
She told Gretel to climb into an oven to be sure it is ready to bake.

01:15.747 --> 01:19.066
But Gretel guessed that the witch intended to bake her.

01:20.087 --> 01:25.721
So she tricked the witch into climbing into the oven, closing it behind her.

01:26.781 --> 01:30.882
Then, they took some jewels and food and ran home.

01:32.115 --> 01:36.862
They were reunited with their father and lived happily ever after.
