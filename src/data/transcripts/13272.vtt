A farmer once owned a goose.

00:07.240 --> 00:10.857
One day, he went to get the egg his goose laid.

00:11.942 --> 00:15.870
When he took it up, it was as heavy as lead.

00:17.273 --> 00:20.037
So he was going to throw it away.

00:21.082 --> 00:23.889
But he took it home on second thought.

00:25.034 --> 00:29.885
To his delight, he found that it was an egg of pure gold.

00:32.296 --> 00:35.735
Every day there was a new golden egg.

00:36.824 --> 00:40.064
He soon became rich by selling his eggs.

00:41.210 --> 00:46.127
He got greedy and decided to kill the goose to get all the gold.

00:47.515 --> 00:51.282
He killed it, cut it open and found nothing.
