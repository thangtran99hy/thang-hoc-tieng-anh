00:25.509 --> 00:28.915
A pilot crashed his plane in the Sahara desert.

00:29.666 --> 00:34.139
A little prince appeared and asked the pilot to draw him a sheep.

00:34.831 --> 00:36.494
The two became friends.

00:37.287 --> 00:43.866
The pilot learned that the prince was from a small planet called Asteroid 325.

00:44.843 --> 00:50.915
One day, a mysterious rose sprouted and the little prince fell in love with it.

00:51.663 --> 00:55.959
But he lost trust in it when he realized the rose lied to him.

00:56.953 --> 01:01.464
Feeling lonely, he decided to explore other planets.

01:04.310 --> 01:07.351
He passed by many asteroids in his travels.

01:08.149 --> 01:12.963
While traveling, he met a king, a vain man, a drunkard,...

01:13.365 --> 01:17.334
...a businessman, a lamplighter and a geographer.

01:18.387 --> 01:22.799
All lived alone and were extremely busy with their own jobs.

01:23.386 --> 01:28.102
He learned from the geographer that roses do not last forever.

01:28.379 --> 01:31.721
All of a sudden, he began to miss his rose.

01:32.499 --> 01:36.797
At the geographer's suggestion, the little prince visited Earth.

01:37.517 --> 01:42.691
But, he landed in the middle of the desert and could not find any humans.

01:43.247 --> 01:49.708
Instead, he met a snake, talked to a flower and climbed the tallest mountains.

01:50.524 --> 01:55.851
The little prince found a rose garden, which surprised and depressed him.

01:56.731 --> 02:01.140
His rose had told him that she was the only one of her kind.

02:03.660 --> 02:05.500
He made a friend with a fox,...

02:06.097 --> 02:10.901
...who taught him that only the heart can see the important things in life.

02:11.418 --> 02:15.020
The fox also taught that his time away from the rose...

02:15.279 --> 02:17.609
...would make the rose more special to him.

02:18.547 --> 02:22.654
The little prince's mind was fixed on returning to his rose.

02:23.493 --> 02:28.095
He began making plans with the snake to go back to his planet.

02:28.698 --> 02:33.385
But the snake bit the prince and he fell noiselessly to the sand.

02:34.171 --> 02:38.373
The next day, the pilot could not find the prince's body.

02:39.105 --> 02:43.423
He wondered if the little prince ever returned to his asteroid.
