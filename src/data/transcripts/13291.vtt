Hello, welcome to Michael's Better Business English.

00:03.987 --> 00:06.687
This month, we're looking at how to persuade people.

00:07.455 --> 00:11.106
Now, I'm sure this is difficult in Japanese as well as in English.

00:11.685 --> 00:15.976
However, here are three techniques to help you persuade people effectively.

00:17.010 --> 00:19.193
First, logical technique.

00:19.948 --> 00:22.773
Now here, when we are trying to persuade somebody logically,...

00:23.246 --> 00:27.168
...we give very clear reasons why they should accept our argument.

00:27.806 --> 00:32.286
For example, we often use data, figures, statistics to support what we're saying.

00:33.027 --> 00:37.419
For example, "Over 80% of our customers prefer this design."

00:37.983 --> 00:39.229
"That's why I recommend it."

00:40.559 --> 00:42.629
Secondly, win-win approach.

00:43.196 --> 00:45.832
This one stresses the mutual benefits:...

00:46.173 --> 00:48.165
...the benefits to both parties.

00:48.794 --> 00:53.253
For example, "Now this option is good for you and good for us."

00:54.985 --> 00:57.703
Third approach is the emotional approach.

00:58.062 --> 01:02.623
Here, you're trying to persuade by playing on the feelings of the listener.

01:03.358 --> 01:05.596
For example, this could be through sympathy.

01:06.478 --> 01:09.683
"Oh, you know how hard I've been working recently."

01:10.085 --> 01:11.957
"That's why I need a bigger bonus."

01:12.994 --> 01:16.639
Or through empathy, when they understand your situation.

01:17.476 --> 01:22.746
For example, "I'm sure you had the same difficulty yourself when you joined the company."

01:23.295 --> 01:25.359
"That's why you understand my situation."

01:27.087 --> 01:31.078
So, when you need to persuade someone, remember these approaches.

01:31.475 --> 01:35.195
Often combining two or even three approaches,...

01:35.518 --> 01:38.253
...that will really help you persuade people more effectively.

01:39.398 --> 01:40.647
Thank you and good luck!
