00:00.383 --> 00:03.456
Did you put lots of thoughts in it?

00:03.843 --> 00:07.762
Yeah, I mean 11 songs totally,...

00:08.019 --> 00:09.789
...because it's over the space of a year and a half,...

00:09.873 --> 00:12.898
...so you know, there were times when I was in love.

00:12.979 --> 00:14.327
There were times when I was out of love.

00:14.412 --> 00:16.314
There were times when I was singing about the world when I wasn't,...

00:16.413 --> 00:19.845
...so I mean it's basically just taking a year and a half out of my life...

00:20.333 --> 00:21.871
...and just putting it into the music basically.

00:24.926 --> 00:28.232
The one way of saying it, it would be like every track sounds kind of different...

00:28.357 --> 00:31.180
...but another way, it would be just, "It's all me."

00:31.775 --> 00:36.033
But just depending on how I was that day, that's how the song turned out.

00:37.515 --> 00:41.355
I listened to the album, I mean not to the whole songs; maybe ten songs?

00:41.429 --> 00:41.720
Okay!

00:41.793 --> 00:43.084
And it's pretty good.

00:43.158 --> 00:43.951
I really liked it.

00:44.039 --> 00:46.663
It's full of hopes; it has a personal message.

00:46.723 --> 00:46.994
Yeah!

00:47.293 --> 00:49.963
And it's really encouraging as well.

00:50.391 --> 00:55.375
And my favorite song is actually "Bokumama".

00:55.603 --> 00:56.013
Okay!

00:56.988 --> 01:00.045
Yes, it's really, really. I mean, it's not like a rock song.

01:00.205 --> 01:02.435
But it's really, how can I put this,...

01:03.427 --> 01:04.567
...really touching.

01:05.252 --> 01:06.921
Yeah, it almost brought me to tears.

01:07.097 --> 01:07.643
Oh, thanks!

01:07.722 --> 01:09.892
Yes, so it's a really emotional song.

01:10.223 --> 01:13.191
Could you tell me about that song, behind the story?

01:13.775 --> 01:15.886
Well, I wanted to write a song all in Japanese.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.953
And I wanted it to have a strong message.

01:19.242 --> 01:23.880
And I was just thinking about people; nobody's perfect.

01:24.141 --> 01:24.911
We all have faults.

01:25.039 --> 01:29.681
But even though we all have faults, we find people and we get together, and we love each other.

01:29.765 --> 01:35.878
And I think just that idea of imperfect people coming together...

01:35.979 --> 01:39.102
...and making something perfect is a pretty cool idea.

01:39.455 --> 01:40.823
So, I wanted to put that into words.

01:41.001 --> 01:46.362
And actually I co - wrote this song with a friend of mine, he's Japanese.

01:46.430 --> 01:46.940
He's an artist.

01:47.031 --> 01:49.093
And he's really good with Japanese lyrics.

01:49.569 --> 01:51.565
So, I brought this whole idea of the song to him...

01:51.657 --> 01:56.222
...and he kind of turned my Japanese into a little; he kind of corrected it a little bit and touched it up.
