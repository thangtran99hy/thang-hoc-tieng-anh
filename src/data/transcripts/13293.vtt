00:00.273 --> 00:00.843
What's up?

00:01.655 --> 00:07.968
I'd like to start the interview with asking you a couple of English questions which have been nagging me for years.

00:08.135 --> 00:08.517
Okay.

00:09.039 --> 00:10.309
How do you say "kokuteri" in English?

00:11.389 --> 00:12.809
How do you say "kokuteri" in English?

00:12.929 --> 00:16.425
I would say probably the first word that comes to mind is "thick".

00:17.763 --> 00:18.478
Yes, but thick?

00:18.715 --> 00:21.413
Thick sort of ends up being like "toro minoaru",...

00:21.640 --> 00:23.250
...or like "torotoro", "dorodoro".

00:25.598 --> 00:31.562
You know, as we were just talking a few minutes ago about "kaori" or "fumi"...

00:32.244 --> 00:36.875
...and then when I'm explaining something to someone in English about something that smells good,...

00:36.976 --> 00:38.981
...I almost invariably switch into Japanese.

00:39.161 --> 00:42.567
Because "fumi" and "kaori" is a lot better than smell or...

00:42.783 --> 00:47.860
Better than saying smell or aroma, which just doesn't seem to give the right nuance.

00:47.949 --> 00:48.219
Right.

00:51.374 --> 00:57.071
"Bouquet" really is almost exclusively to either wine or something that's particularly aromatic.

00:58.615 --> 01:05.275
I think whereas it doesn't fit into just sort of the main usage of the word "bouquet".

01:06.109 --> 01:14.838
And I think "bouquet" also, you think of something sort of almost blossoming in smell.

01:16.449 --> 01:21.679
Whereas "fumi" is more like, you can almost see the flavor coming out of your nose.

01:22.062 --> 01:25.982
You know, to me Japanese is funny. As I get better at it,...

01:26.330 --> 01:31.235
...you know, you got sweeping little words that help to explain a specific thing.

01:31.364 --> 01:33.093
And "fumi" is the taste of the wind.

01:33.403 --> 01:34.909
So it's, you know the "kanji"?

01:36.275 --> 01:38.375
It's a little bit more nebulous than just smell.

01:38.461 --> 01:38.730
Right.

01:39.546 --> 01:43.903
And it has more of a taste sense, a flavor sense.

01:44.022 --> 01:46.355
And then once again, to explain the kokuteri,...

01:46.454 --> 01:49.992
...I think the biggest problem is that if we were really to delve into this...

01:51.409 --> 01:53.754
You know, this is the big problem between Japanese and English.

01:53.835 --> 01:54.972
There isn't just one word.
