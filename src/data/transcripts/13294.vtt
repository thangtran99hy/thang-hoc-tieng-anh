00:26.172 --> 00:29.660
A widow, Mrs. Dashwood, and her three daughters,...

00:29.786 --> 00:36.197
...Elinor, Marianne and Margaret moved in with the Middletons, who are distant relatives.

00:37.078 --> 00:42.457
Elinor was sad to leave because she had become close to Edward Ferrars.

00:43.504 --> 00:47.647
Elinor and Marianne met Colonel Brandon and John Willoughby.

00:48.567 --> 00:53.212
Willoughby courted Marianne and they showed off their love for each other.

00:54.191 --> 01:00.021
Willoughby departed for London on business, leaving Marianne lovesick and miserable.

01:02.914 --> 01:10.561
Anne and Lucy Steele, relatives of the Middletons, visited Barton Park, which was the Middletons's home.

01:11.417 --> 01:14.081
Lucy and Elinor became close friends.

01:14.927 --> 01:20.408
Lucy told Elinor that she was secretly engaged to Edward Ferrars.

01:21.151 --> 01:25.330
Later, when Edward's mother found out that he was engaged,...

01:25.817 --> 01:31.840
...she decided to leave her fortune to Robert, Edward's younger brother, when she dies.

01:34.628 --> 01:41.823
Elinor and Marianne traveled to London, where everyone was talking of Marianne's engagement to Willoughby.

01:42.791 --> 01:48.051
Willoughby, however, denied that he ever had any feelings for Marianne.

01:48.835 --> 01:52.741
Brandon explained that Willoughby was callous and corrupt.

01:53.739 --> 02:00.215
Having squandered his fortune, Willoughby became engaged to Miss Grey, a wealthy woman.

02:01.009 --> 02:05.581
Marianne developed a severe cold and became deathly ill.

02:06.387 --> 02:10.995
When Willoughby heard of this, he visited her and asked forgiveness.

02:12.015 --> 02:16.790
It turned out that Lucy actually married Robert Ferrars, not Edward.

02:17.616 --> 02:21.917
Edward and Elinor were married, as were Marianne and Brandon.
