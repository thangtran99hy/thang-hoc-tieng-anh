Antonio was a wealthy merchant in the Italian city of Venice.

00:06.920 --> 00:12.237
His friend, Bassanio, needed money to impress Portia, a wealthy heiress.

00:13.369 --> 00:15.730
Antonio could not make the loan himself...

00:16.136 --> 00:19.543
...because his own money was invested in a number of trade ships.

00:20.654 --> 00:26.039
Antonio and Bassanio approached Shylock, a Jewish moneylender, for a loan.

00:26.875 --> 00:33.694
In fact, Shylock disliked Antonio because he spoke out against his dishonest way of lending money.

00:34.929 --> 00:38.737
To their surprise, Shylock agreed to lend Bassanio the money.

00:39.718 --> 00:43.501
A condition, however, was that if the loan goes unpaid,...

00:44.216 --> 00:47.975
...Shylock would be entitled to a pound of Antonio's flesh.

00:50.886 --> 00:56.113
Antonio's ships were lost at sea, meaning that he was unable to repay the loan.

00:56.973 --> 00:58.075
The matter went to court.

00:59.029 --> 01:02.645
Shylock could indeed demand a pound of flesh from Antonio.

01:03.691 --> 01:07.310
A legal expert, who was really Portia disguised as a man,...

01:08.052 --> 01:10.552
...told Shylock that he could draw no blood.

01:11.525 --> 01:14.239
The contract did not entitle him to any blood.

01:15.183 --> 01:17.564
Consequently, Shylock got nothing.

01:18.491 --> 01:22.040
He was found guilty of conspiring to kill a Venetian citizen.

01:23.078 --> 01:28.081
The penalty was death, but all involved agreed that the punishment should be different.

01:29.068 --> 01:32.476
Shylock was fined, and he had to convert to Christianity.

01:33.476 --> 01:38.013
Soon after, the joyful news arrived that Antonio's ships came back safely.
