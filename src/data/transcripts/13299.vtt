00:21.835 --> 00:25.593
Oliver Twist was born in a workhouse in 1830s England.

00:26.373 --> 00:32.113
His mother died very soon after, and Oliver went to a badly - run home for orphans.

00:33.183 --> 00:37.070
Nine years later, he was transferred to a workhouse for adults.

00:37.887 --> 00:42.131
He was eventually sold off as an apprentice to a local undertaker,...

00:42.722 --> 00:45.025
...but ran away and traveled toward London.

00:47.743 --> 00:51.836
He met Jack Dawkins, a boy his own age, who worked for Fagin.

00:52.826 --> 00:56.729
Fagin was a criminal who taught young orphan boys to pickpocket.

00:57.787 --> 01:03.647
A sickly and feverish Oliver was caught while stealing a handkerchief from Mr. Brownlow.

01:04.845 --> 01:09.858
Rather than pressing charges, Brownlow took Oliver home and nursed him back to health.

01:10.964 --> 01:14.777
Two young adults in Fagin's gang, Bill and his lover Nancy,...

01:15.313 --> 01:17.884
...captured Oliver and returned him to Fagin.

01:18.854 --> 01:24.306
In a burglary attempt, Oliver was shot, then taken in by the woman of the house.

01:25.107 --> 01:30.732
Her name was Mrs. Maylie and she lived with her beautiful, adopted niece, Rose.

01:31.719 --> 01:34.669
Fagin and Monks wanted to recapture Oliver.

01:35.425 --> 01:37.341
Nancy told Rose of the plan.

01:40.001 --> 01:43.433
In the meantime, Mr. Brownlow confronted Monks...

01:43.612 --> 01:46.914
...and found out that Monks was Oliver's half-brother.

01:47.882 --> 01:53.485
Their father was unhappily married to a wealthy woman and had an affair with Oliver's mother.

01:55.304 --> 02:01.179
Monks had pursued Oliver to ensure that Oliver would never receive his share of the family inheritance.

02:02.206 --> 02:06.834
Brownlow forced Monks to sign over to Oliver, his rightful share.

02:07.657 --> 02:11.310
Moreover, it turned out that Rose was Oliver's aunt.

02:12.341 --> 02:18.136
Fagin was hanged for these crimes. Finally, Brownlow adopted Oliver and they,...

02:18.435 --> 02:21.217
...along with the Maylies, moved to the countryside.
