00:05.713 --> 00:09.674
So a few years ago, my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry.

00:10.560 --> 00:15.817
In 2006, young Qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps.

00:16.266 --> 00:20.148
And since then I've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights.

00:20.485 --> 00:25.321
In the last six months, more than 300 skyscrapers in the UAE have been put on hold or canceled.

00:26.172 --> 00:28.921
Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings...

00:29.017 --> 00:31.572
...is the fate of the often-indentured construction worker,...

00:32.524 --> 00:33.849
...1.1 million of them.

00:34.913 --> 00:39.546
Mainly Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, and Nepalese, these laborers risk everything...

00:39.956 --> 00:41.841
...to make money for their families back home.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.706
They pay a middleman thousands of dollars to be there.

00:45.297 --> 00:48.077
And when they arrive, they find themselves in labor camps with no water,...

00:48.742 --> 00:51.564
...no air conditioning and their passports taken away.

00:52.991 --> 00:56.681
While it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities,...

00:56.953 --> 00:59.587
...99 percent of these people are hired by the private sector.

01:00.289 --> 01:02.036
And then the financial collapse happened.

01:03.003 --> 01:04.666
When the contractors had gone bust,...

01:04.821 --> 01:06.728
...as they'd been overleveraged like everyone else,...

01:07.355 --> 01:08.969
...the difference is everything goes missing,...

01:09.759 --> 01:13.754
...documentation, passports, and tickets home for these workers.

01:14.279 --> 01:17.639
Currently right now, thousands of workers are abandoned.

01:18.008 --> 01:19.217
There's no way back home.

01:19.765 --> 01:22.140
And there is no way and no proof of arrival.

01:22.957 --> 01:25.218
These are the boom and bust refugees.

01:26.187 --> 01:29.279
So let's not forget who's really paying the price of this financial collapse.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.499
And that as we worry about our next job in the office,...

01:32.773 --> 01:35.043
...the next design that we can get to keep our workers,...

01:35.777 --> 01:38.790
...let's not forget these men who are truly dying to work.

01:39.318 --> 01:39.656
Thank you.
