Living well doesn't have to cost an arm and a leg.

00:09.609 --> 00:11.312
And cheap doesn't have to look it.

00:12.369 --> 00:14.458
You will need very little.

00:14.967 --> 00:18.737
Step one: Find a free or low-cost place to live.

00:19.177 --> 00:22.201
Search online for house sitting positions both seasonal,...

00:22.284 --> 00:26.313
...such as for beach and ski houses, and full-time as a caretaker.

00:27.244 --> 00:31.127
Step two: Buy your clothes and furnishings at thrift stores.

00:31.537 --> 00:34.221
If you check them out frequently, you'll find great stuff.

00:34.895 --> 00:37.314
Keep an eye out for bargains with resale value,...

00:37.491 --> 00:41.025
...like kitchen appliances that you can flip online after a little repair.

00:42.359 --> 00:45.211
Step three: Eat only what's in season.

00:45.472 --> 00:47.222
It's plentiful and cheap.

00:47.515 --> 00:50.435
Plan meals around what's on sale, clip coupons...

00:50.663 --> 00:54.702
...and use foods that give you more nutritional bang for your buck, like beans.

00:56.245 --> 00:58.873
One week a month, forego grocery shopping...

00:59.009 --> 01:02.035
...and just focus on finishing what's in your fridge and cupboards.

01:02.338 --> 01:04.386
You'll be amazed how much this will save you.

01:05.505 --> 01:08.350
Step four: Drink mostly tap water.

01:08.549 --> 01:10.211
You'll be richer and healthier.

01:11.237 --> 01:15.547
Step five: Whenever possible, walk or bike to your destination.

01:15.930 --> 01:17.345
Get rid of your car if you can.

01:17.833 --> 01:21.057
Bonus, if you do this, you won't need a gym membership.

01:21.779 --> 01:22.539
Did you know?

01:22.899 --> 01:27.159
Research shows that most millionaires live well below their means.
