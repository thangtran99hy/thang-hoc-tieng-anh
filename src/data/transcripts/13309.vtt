Your first big film "Joint Security Area" directed by Park Chan-wook,...

00:05.161 --> 00:08.403
...did you ever think it was going to be as big as what it was?

00:09.285 --> 00:19.306
No, I don't think so, because nobody estimates about the result when they're filming it.

00:20.455 --> 00:22.823
Of course, I didn't too. So,...

00:24.257 --> 00:30.674
...we're surprised by the amount of the audience and...

00:32.147 --> 00:35.225
...that movie made me so popular and famous in Korea.

00:36.398 --> 00:39.138
So, I was really thankful to Mr. Park.

00:49.597 --> 00:53.877
The film was based on tension between North and South Korea.

00:54.048 --> 00:58.191
And I believe it was the first film that portrayed North Koreans in a good way.

00:59.091 --> 01:01.933
How did you feel being involved in such a project?

01:02.297 --> 01:04.490
That's the point that I liked.

01:06.489 --> 01:09.933
It's not about the ideology or something like that.

01:10.025 --> 01:12.304
It's not political things.

01:14.869 --> 01:17.280
That movie tells about the human.

01:17.812 --> 01:20.957
Do you think it changed the way that South Koreans view their neighbors?

01:21.045 --> 01:23.621
Do they look differently at North Korea because of your movie?

01:23.963 --> 01:26.010
Maybe that movie infected the people.

01:27.501 --> 01:29.973
Of course, because it was a huge success.

01:30.655 --> 01:36.271
So, most of the people watched it and...

01:36.526 --> 01:41.274
That movie is based on the truth, so people would say,...

01:41.726 --> 01:46.446
...people would think, "They're the same humans like us."

01:57.001 --> 02:00.635
Do you think that there will be reunification? In your lifetime?

02:01.312 --> 02:02.621
Personally, I hope so.

02:03.313 --> 02:06.231
Yeah, it could happen I think.

02:17.633 --> 02:20.378
Following the success of "Joint Security Area",...

02:20.778 --> 02:24.865
...Byung-hun went on to star in the critically acclaimed "A Bittersweet Life"...

02:27.227 --> 02:31.862
...and "The Good, the Bad, the Weird" which premiered at Cannes in 2008.

02:32.809 --> 02:36.957
But as Byung-hun himself points out, his best work is yet to come.

02:37.279 --> 02:39.734
I understand that you are your harshest critic,...

02:40.515 --> 02:43.875
...that you're never fully happy with your performance.

02:45.051 --> 02:45.740
Why is that?
