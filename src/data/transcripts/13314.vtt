00:18.140 --> 00:22.883
The story took place in the late 1930's, during the Spanish Civil War.

00:23.661 --> 00:27.878
A guerrilla group, led by Pablo, was behind enemy lines.

00:29.513 --> 00:32.671
Robert Jordan was an American explosives expert.

00:33.641 --> 00:35.980
He was assigned to blow up an enemy bridge.

00:36.831 --> 00:41.643
Pablo was against this plan and Jordan worried that Pablo would betray them.

00:42.658 --> 00:47.719
Jordan met Maria, a beautiful Spanish girl, and they immediately fell in love.

00:48.752 --> 00:52.971
All guerrillas wanted to kill Pablo, but Jordan did not want to.

00:53.925 --> 00:58.627
Pablo's wife Pilar told of how Pablo arranged a massacre.

01:00.004 --> 01:05.578
Pablo left the group, then returned, and Jordan realized that he could not trust Pablo.

01:08.415 --> 01:11.395
Jordan shot an enemy soldier who came to camp.

01:12.335 --> 01:16.699
Some of the guerrillas, led by El Sordo, kept the enemy's horse,...

01:17.133 --> 01:18.557
...then went out to look for more.

01:19.782 --> 01:23.196
El Sordo's men were ambushed by the enemy and killed.

01:24.004 --> 01:28.196
Through all of this, Jordan and Maria took the time to discuss their future.

01:28.941 --> 01:33.599
Jordan sent a young guerrilla to General Golz with news of El Sordo's defeat...

01:33.907 --> 01:36.081
...and a request that the offensive be canceled.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.579
The message did not reach General Golz in time.

01:42.331 --> 01:44.838
Pablo stole some dynamite and disappeared.

01:45.480 --> 01:50.945
He returned later with five men and Jordan became confident they could accomplish their mission.

01:52.241 --> 01:54.870
At dawn the next day, they blew up the bridge.

01:55.538 --> 01:59.604
Many of the guerrillas were killed, including Jordan's guide and friend.

02:00.480 --> 02:03.103
Jordan was injured when his horse fell on his leg.

02:03.995 --> 02:09.733
Despondent, Maria tried to convince Jordan to allow her to stay with him, but he refused.

02:10.649 --> 02:15.400
While the others escaped, Jordan stayed behind, to delay the advancing enemy.
