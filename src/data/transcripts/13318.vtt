00:01.955 --> 00:08.435
Iago hated General Othello because Othello did not make him an officer in the army.

00:09.131 --> 00:15.213
Desdemona, daughter of Senator Brabantio, ran off with Othello to be married.

00:15.977 --> 00:17.453
They moved to Cyprus.

00:18.161 --> 00:20.719
Iago planned to destroy their lives.

00:21.372 --> 00:26.607
He caused Roderigo, who loved Desdemona, to fight a duel with Cassio.

00:27.583 --> 00:33.027
Cassio's reputation was smeared and he blamed Othello for his misfortune.

00:33.565 --> 00:39.055
Iago told Cassio to ask Desdemona to speak to Othello on his behalf.

00:39.878 --> 00:43.949
Iago hoped to plant the seeds of jealousy in Othello's mind.

00:44.671 --> 00:50.975
The plan worked and Othello suspected Cassio and Desdemona of having an affair.

00:51.757 --> 00:56.025
Othello was enraged, but demanded proof of any affair.

00:58.884 --> 01:05.108
Desdemona accidentally dropped a handkerchief on the floor, given to her by Othello.

01:06.216 --> 01:11.603
Iago placed it in Cassio's room, hoping to prove their illicit relationship.

01:12.775 --> 01:19.691
Iago and Roderigo both wanted to destroy Othello, but Iago murdered Roderigo.

01:20.769 --> 01:26.779
When Othello heard of the handkerchief, he smothered his wife because of her unfaithfulness.

01:27.969 --> 01:33.856
Desdemona's maidservant told Othello that Desdemona was never unfaithful.

01:34.807 --> 01:39.343
As she explained Iago's plan, Iago stabbed and killed her.

01:40.761 --> 01:46.137
Letters written by Roderigo further explained Iago's entire scheme.

01:47.243 --> 01:53.495
Othello stabbed Iago but did not kill him, so that Iago would always live in pain.

01:54.353 --> 01:56.399
Othello then killed himself.
