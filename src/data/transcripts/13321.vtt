00:00.239 --> 00:05.213
I'm trying to be perfect, especially in the shooting place...

00:07.526 --> 00:11.139
...because I have a lot of responsibility to the audience.

00:12.041 --> 00:15.737
I'm not doing this job as a joke.

00:19.176 --> 00:26.279
I had to persuade the audience with my acting, with my emotions.

00:27.438 --> 00:30.137
So, that's why I really want to be perfect.

00:30.392 --> 00:32.885
It's a good thing as an actor but as a human,...

00:34.790 --> 00:37.909
...in my real life, it's so bad sometimes.

00:38.387 --> 00:38.981
In what way?

00:39.907 --> 00:46.787
I could not enjoy fully everything because I always think about something.

00:47.194 --> 00:55.602
In my real life, I try to have a lot of fun; I try to be natural.

00:56.648 --> 00:57.568
How do you have fun?

00:57.749 --> 00:59.327
What do you do to unwind?

00:59.997 --> 01:05.598
Watching movies, as drinking wine.

01:07.738 --> 01:09.995
That's my best time.

01:11.535 --> 01:13.311
Do you miss being anonymous?

01:13.535 --> 01:20.709
Are there ever days that you wish that you could just walk down the street and go unrecognized?

01:21.406 --> 01:25.205
What I really wanted to do was drive a taxi.

01:25.759 --> 01:26.203
Oh!

01:26.349 --> 01:30.767
I borrowed a taxi from my friend.

01:32.118 --> 01:34.286
He was the boss of the taxi company...

01:35.157 --> 01:39.271
...and I borrowed the taxi and I drove it for a few days.

01:40.229 --> 01:45.545
It was so fun and it was an interesting experience.

01:45.621 --> 01:47.653
So, you were picking up people and taking them.

01:49.024 --> 01:54.808
But nobody recognized me because I was hiding everything.

01:54.992 --> 01:57.237
How did it feel for those couple of days...

01:57.370 --> 01:59.293
...being normal, being anonymous?

02:01.889 --> 02:07.739
It's so interesting and that was a weird experience to me...

02:08.355 --> 02:20.746
...because I'm used to living as an actor so that was strange.

02:26.597 --> 02:29.209
So, what happens now? We go to the red carpet.

02:29.335 --> 02:29.793
Red carpet.

02:30.025 --> 02:33.176
You get out, lots of screaming fans and lots of interviews today?

02:34.971 --> 02:41.644
No, there must be a lot of cameras over there, so we have to take a picture for them.

02:42.093 --> 02:43.266
No interviews from now on.

02:43.406 --> 02:43.791
Okay.

02:43.963 --> 02:46.941
And we're just gonna just walk on the red carpet...

02:47.540 --> 02:50.436
...and wave our hands to the fans.

02:51.288 --> 02:52.315
Is this the fun bit?

02:52.821 --> 02:55.638
Yeah, that's one of the most fun parts.

02:55.794 --> 02:56.183
Yeah.

02:57.940 --> 02:59.179
Wow. A lot of people.

03:05.215 --> 03:06.571
Nerves? Any nerves?

03:06.949 --> 03:07.527
Normal.

03:10.188 --> 03:11.240
Good luck, good luck.

03:11.922 --> 03:12.171
Thank you!

03:12.274 --> 03:12.687
Good luck!
