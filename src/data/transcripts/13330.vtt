00:01.779 --> 00:06.881
The Scottish King Duncan learned that his two generals had defeated invading armies.

00:07.841 --> 00:13.422
After the battles, the generals Macbeth and Banquo, encountered three witches.

00:14.285 --> 00:18.133
They made a prophecy that Macbeth would be crowned King of Scotland.

00:19.607 --> 00:25.547
They also prophesied that Banquo's sons would become Scottish kings, but not him.

00:26.856 --> 00:31.885
Macbeth thought that their prophecy might be true, but he was uncertain what to expect.

00:34.894 --> 00:38.651
He invited King Duncan to his castle at Inverness for dinner.

00:39.987 --> 00:45.039
Lady Macbeth persuaded her husband to kill Duncan that very night, by stabbing him.

00:46.381 --> 00:48.439
She was certain the prophecy would come true.

00:49.389 --> 00:53.657
They got Duncan's two royal servants drunk and blamed the murder on them.

00:54.825 --> 00:59.037
Macbeth killed them to avenge the king's death and become king himself.

01:00.087 --> 01:04.812
But he feared that Banquo's sons would seize his crown, as prophesied.

01:06.411 --> 01:09.790
Macbeth planned to kill Banquo and his son Fleance.

01:10.757 --> 01:13.121
Banquo was killed but Fleance escaped.

01:15.892 --> 01:19.736
At an evening banquet, Banquo's ghost visited Macbeth,...

01:20.442 --> 01:23.388
...and he cried out in front of many noble guests.

01:24.383 --> 01:27.091
Frightened, Macbeth went to visit the witches.

01:28.039 --> 01:30.439
There, they told him of more prophecies.

01:32.257 --> 01:35.031
One was that he had to beware of MacDuff,...

01:35.596 --> 01:39.117
...a Scottish nobleman who opposed his succession to the crown.

01:40.247 --> 01:45.333
So Macbeth seized his castle and killed his family, while MacDuff stayed in England.

01:46.571 --> 01:49.249
MacDuff led the English army against Macbeth.

01:50.357 --> 01:53.432
Lady Macbeth killed herself, after ongoing nightmares.

01:54.520 --> 01:59.659
Macbeth and MacDuff met on the battlefield and MacDuff finally killed Macbeth.

02:00.600 --> 02:05.245
Then, Prince Malcolm, son of Duncan, became the King of Scotland.
