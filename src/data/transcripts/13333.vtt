Hi, I'm Katie Stiles with "Before and After TV".

00:03.328 --> 00:06.209
Today, I'm going to show you how you can effectively furnish...

00:06.306 --> 00:07.738
...and decorate a small space.

00:08.051 --> 00:11.141
This living room is approximately 180 square feet.

00:11.549 --> 00:13.909
With the use of sleek and modern furniture...

00:13.995 --> 00:15.991
...and a streamlined entertainment system,...

00:16.298 --> 00:19.573
...you can actually make your space appear bigger and define the room.

00:19.894 --> 00:21.649
And I'd like to share my ideas with you.

00:36.821 --> 00:40.294
So here we have a really comfortable, beautifully furnished room.

00:40.392 --> 00:46.389
We've made great use of a small space by using very sleek leather couches.

00:46.767 --> 00:47.767
They're not too big.

00:47.845 --> 00:50.508
Sometimes people use the oversized couches.

00:50.939 --> 00:53.170
They're accented with some nice pillows.

00:53.287 --> 00:57.998
What I love about this room is the large, bold print carpet.

00:58.147 --> 01:02.872
And a large carpet will elongate a room, make it appear bigger.

01:03.212 --> 01:07.639
What I also really love is the use of ottomans in place of a coffee table.

01:07.737 --> 01:11.657
A large coffee table can take up way too much space in a small room...

01:12.035 --> 01:14.234
And with the ottomans, you can move them around,...

01:14.298 --> 01:17.259
...you can use them as seats, you can use them as side table...

01:17.621 --> 01:19.731
...or right in front of you as a coffee table.

01:20.511 --> 01:23.679
A really important thing is not to clutter a small space...

01:23.798 --> 01:26.070
...so pick your decorative items carefully.

01:26.441 --> 01:28.230
Make sure that they are amongst your favorite...

01:28.322 --> 01:31.015
...and that they reflect your personality and your style.

01:31.583 --> 01:33.641
Of course, for your entertainment system,...

01:33.775 --> 01:37.704
...a plasma TV or a flat - screen TV works really well in a small room...

01:37.793 --> 01:39.779
...because you don't lose all of that wall space.

01:40.191 --> 01:46.606
And I love modern - meets - old by placing the plasma on top of an antique cabinet.

01:47.363 --> 01:49.137
As you can see, it's really quite easy...

01:49.208 --> 01:51.853
...to effectively decorate and furnish a small space.

01:52.130 --> 01:55.037
Use a mix of your existing pieces combined with some new ones...

01:55.181 --> 01:57.485
...and all you have to do now is sit back and enjoy.
