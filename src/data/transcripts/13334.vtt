00:05.621 --> 00:07.073
Put yourself in the shoes of a burglar...

00:07.195 --> 00:09.542
...so you can anticipate where they'd look for your valuables.

00:09.911 --> 00:10.395
You will need...

00:10.854 --> 00:13.171
...a home safe and an empty cereal box.

00:13.757 --> 00:16.988
Step one : Understand that the burglar has two goals,...

00:17.316 --> 00:20.937
...to find your valuables and to get in and out of your house as fast as possible.

00:21.323 --> 00:24.493
Step two : Leave a small amount of cash in an obvious spot...

00:24.881 --> 00:27.031
...so burglars think they've found all the cash in your house...

00:27.109 --> 00:28.392
...and won't bother looking for more.

00:28.824 --> 00:31.215
Step three : Spread out your valuables and money.

00:31.589 --> 00:34.790
Hide some in messy areas that would take a burglar too long to go through,...

00:34.985 --> 00:37.508
...such as a child's room, basement, or garage.

00:37.833 --> 00:41.199
Don't hide valuables in obvious places like drawers or purses.

00:41.563 --> 00:46.093
Step four : Make a diversion box with an ordinary item, such as a cereal box.

00:46.286 --> 00:47.617
Store valuables in the box.

00:48.023 --> 00:52.344
Step five : Store extra valuable items in a home safe bolted to the floor.

00:53.169 --> 00:57.495
Step six : Keep track of the valuables in your house in case you are the victim of burglary.

00:57.940 --> 01:01.083
But hopefully, you'll outsmart the burglar by staying one step ahead of them.

01:01.785 --> 01:02.357
Did you know?

01:02.821 --> 01:07.754
From 1998 to 2007, property crime in the US declined 10%.
