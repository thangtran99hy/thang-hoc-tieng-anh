Almost anyone knows how to play tic-tac-toe...

00:09.262 --> 00:12.845
...but not everyone knows the strategy that guarantees they'll never lose another game.

00:13.647 --> 00:17.551
You will need: an opponent, a pencil or pen and paper.

00:21.591 --> 00:25.921
Step 1: Draw your tic-tac-toe board on a piece of paper using a pen or a pencil.

00:26.269 --> 00:28.403
It should have nine squares total, with three at the top,...

00:28.641 --> 00:30.099
...three in the middle, and three on the bottom.

00:30.709 --> 00:33.517
Step 2: Whether you are flipping a coin or throwing dice,...

00:33.670 --> 00:36.696
...you need to win the right to the first move if you don't want to lose the game.

00:38.001 --> 00:40.903
Step 3: Mark the center square with an "X" or an "O".

00:41.311 --> 00:42.787
This is the key to guaranteeing...

00:42.879 --> 00:45.646
...you'll never lose in tic-tac-toe when you have the first move.

00:46.309 --> 00:48.585
Following this rule will not guarantee you a win.

00:48.982 --> 00:53.282
It will guarantee that, even against a tic-tac-toe master, you will never lose.

00:53.727 --> 00:56.065
Step 4: After an opponent makes their mark,...

00:56.411 --> 00:58.841
...look to see if there is a square to the right of it available.

00:59.154 --> 01:00.787
If so, take it with your next move.

01:01.667 --> 01:04.333
Step 5: If the square to the right isn't available,...

01:04.560 --> 01:06.423
...take the square to the left with your next move.

01:09.957 --> 01:13.063
Step 6: If the squares to the right and left are taken,...

01:13.477 --> 01:15.356
...place your next mark above their last mark.

01:18.716 --> 01:21.189
Step 7: If the squares to the right and left...

01:21.419 --> 01:23.542
...and above your opponent's last move are taken,...

01:23.763 --> 01:24.883
...choose the square below it.

01:28.225 --> 01:32.873
Step 8: Repeat the right - left - above - and - below rule for each move you play.

01:33.528 --> 01:34.321
Congratulations!

01:34.632 --> 01:36.703
You may not win but you'll never be a loser.

01:39.043 --> 01:39.543
Did you know?

01:39.826 --> 01:43.138
In the movie "WarGames", war is averted when the computer is shown...

01:43.223 --> 01:46.023
...that nuclear war, like tic-tac-toe, cannot be won.
