After big drops in Asia and Europe, it was Wall Street's turn.

00:14.243 --> 00:16.664
In its first trading day since the S&P downgrade,...

00:16.931 --> 00:20.183
...the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged below 11,000,...

00:20.525 --> 00:24.799
...losing 635 points in the worst sell-off in nearly three years.

00:25.051 --> 00:31.188
Some say what may be happening is a new realization that the global economy led by the US is slowing down.

00:31.386 --> 00:35.887
But many in New York believe Washington's failure to come to grips with the nation's growing debt...

00:36.115 --> 00:38.315
...is the reason why markets are so spooked.

00:38.635 --> 00:40.893
The White House, for the most part, agrees.

00:41.231 --> 00:43.627
In his first comment since the historic downgrade,...

00:43.902 --> 00:47.813
...President Barack Obama said the US did not need a credit rating agency...

00:47.911 --> 00:50.121
...to say that Washington politics is broken.

00:50.737 --> 00:52.217
Markets will rise and fall...

00:53.502 --> 00:54.968
...but this is the United States of America.

00:56.583 --> 00:58.443
No matter what some agency may say,...

00:59.853 --> 01:03.465
...we've always been and always will be a AAA country.

01:04.039 --> 01:06.973
But others say the problem is that what happens in the US...

01:07.073 --> 01:09.845
...is bound to have an economic impact in other countries.

01:10.179 --> 01:11.716
The good news, the president says...

01:11.975 --> 01:17.213
...is that the market turmoil may be the catalyst Congress needs to tackle the nation's long - term problems.

01:17.618 --> 01:23.638
The bad news say market analysts, is that the Dow has now lost about 15% of its value in the last two weeks.
