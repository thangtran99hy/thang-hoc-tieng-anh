Hello everybody, welcome back to "Here's an Idea",...

00:01.858 --> 00:03.667
...a minute and a half or so of marketing insight.

00:04.055 --> 00:04.801
I'm Hal Brice.

00:05.079 --> 00:08.259
Today, I wanna share one of the coolest marketing things I've seen in quite a while.

00:08.545 --> 00:11.471
This is a case study from Tesco out of Korea.

00:11.851 --> 00:15.059
Now, Tesco is that big global retailer based in England...

00:15.135 --> 00:16.756
...but they actually operate all around the world.

00:17.197 --> 00:18.882
Their stores in Korea however, were struggling...

00:18.963 --> 00:23.082
...because their main competitor out - stored them by a large margin...

00:23.165 --> 00:25.771
...and they couldn't build stores fast enough to catch up.

00:26.202 --> 00:27.328
So they ask themselves the question:...

00:27.616 --> 00:30.836
...how can we become number one without having to build stores?

00:31.221 --> 00:33.927
And their answer was to create virtual stores.

00:34.001 --> 00:34.763
Take a look at this.

00:35.100 --> 00:41.101
What they did was that they put in these Korean subways these virtual stores that were basically flat billboards.

00:41.503 --> 00:43.061
And it looked like a grocery store.

00:43.502 --> 00:45.060
While they're waiting for their train to come in,...

00:45.161 --> 00:46.735
...customers walk up to the store...

00:47.245 --> 00:51.968
...and punch a picture of the product they want with their QR code that's on each product.

00:52.506 --> 00:56.971
That goes into their shopping cart on their phone which then is in turn sent to Tesco.

00:57.269 --> 00:58.704
And by the time they get home from work,...

00:58.831 --> 01:01.923
...right behind them comes the guy from Tesco with their products.

01:02.272 --> 01:04.577
It really takes a lot of stress out of shopping,...

01:04.901 --> 01:07.529
...and it allows them to take time which would be normally dead time,...

01:07.846 --> 01:09.715
...and actually turn it into productive time.

01:09.925 --> 01:14.402
So, that's just a sample of where the world of smartphones and things like QR codes are going,...

01:14.750 --> 01:16.645
...taking a lot of the hassle out of shopping.

01:17.055 --> 01:19.635
So, if you are a retailer, the question for you is...

01:19.886 --> 01:21.227
...do you have a mobile strategy?

01:21.597 --> 01:22.877
If not, it's time to get one.

01:23.356 --> 01:24.157
That's "Here's an Idea."

01:24.452 --> 01:25.052
Thanks for watching.

01:25.205 --> 01:25.935
