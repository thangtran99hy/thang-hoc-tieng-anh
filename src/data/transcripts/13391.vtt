My friend Sarah has run a small online business out of her living room for 12 years.

00:04.585 --> 00:07.479
It's her whole life; she takes it very, very personally.

00:08.261 --> 00:12.451
Last week, one of her clients sent her a ten-page long scathing email,...

00:12.847 --> 00:17.159
...chopping her down, calling her a scam artist and other vicious personal insults,...

00:17.539 --> 00:19.996
...saying she was going to sue Sarah for everything she's worth,...

00:20.297 --> 00:22.389
...as retribution for a mishandled account.

00:23.460 --> 00:26.440
Devastated, Sarah turned off her computer and cried.

00:27.384 --> 00:30.248
She shut off the phones and closed up shop for the day.

00:31.047 --> 00:34.275
She spent the whole weekend in bed, wondering if she should just give up,...

00:34.856 --> 00:38.039
...thinking maybe every insult in this client's letter was true...

00:38.381 --> 00:41.748
...and she's actually no good at what she does, even after 12 years.

00:42.986 --> 00:45.721
On Sunday, she spent about five hours most of the day...

00:45.988 --> 00:48.977
...carefully addressing every point in this ten-page email.

00:49.814 --> 00:52.723
Then she went through the client's website, learning everything about her...

00:53.073 --> 00:56.568
...and offered all kinds of advice and suggestions, and connections.

00:57.428 --> 01:00.596
Sarah refunded the client's money plus an additional $50...

01:01.017 --> 01:02.536
...with gushing deep apologies...

01:02.863 --> 01:05.949
...for ever having upset someone she was honestly trying to help.

01:06.928 --> 01:10.127
The next day, she called the client to try to talk through the situation with her.

01:10.986 --> 01:14.260
The client cheerfully took her call and said, "Oh! Don't worry about it."

01:14.484 --> 01:16.655
"I wasn't actually that upset. I was just in a bad mood."

01:16.789 --> 01:18.823
"I didn't think anyone would read my email anyway."
