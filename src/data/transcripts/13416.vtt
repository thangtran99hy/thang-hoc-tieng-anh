00:00.441 --> 00:01.163
Hello.

00:01.391 --> 00:02.536
Hello. Wait.

00:02.747 --> 00:03.130
Oh, yes?

00:05.568 --> 00:06.745
Oh, it's wet.

00:07.727 --> 00:09.088
Did you spit on the carpet?

00:09.166 --> 00:09.503
No.

00:11.445 --> 00:12.434
It may be drool.

00:13.659 --> 00:14.657
Really? Is it?

00:14.996 --> 00:16.161
I'm totally kidding you.

00:16.866 --> 00:18.116
I got you scared for a minute.

00:18.178 --> 00:19.014
I am very scared.

00:20.128 --> 00:21.252
I'm a very nervous man.

00:22.142 --> 00:24.311
I like your bling. It's very nice.

00:25.063 --> 00:26.143
It's all fake, by the way.

00:26.231 --> 00:26.611
Is it, really?

00:26.705 --> 00:26.851
Yes.

00:27.037 --> 00:29.398
Well, that'll be right at home here.

00:31.709 --> 00:33.889
This is all fake. I'm a 14-year-old girl.

00:36.996 --> 00:37.732
Nice to meet you.

00:37.800 --> 00:38.729
It's very nice to meet you.

00:39.357 --> 00:40.587
Did I pronounce your name properly?

00:42.811 --> 00:45.942
I told my best friend from high school that I was coming on your show...

00:46.398 --> 00:51.525
...and she said, "He's so delicious." I swear she did.

00:51.616 --> 00:52.091
Delicious?

00:52.181 --> 00:54.385
Delicious was the word that she used.

00:54.562 --> 00:56.817
Then I said, "He's funny."

00:56.999 --> 00:57.670
Yeah, he's fun.

01:00.936 --> 01:01.837
But not delicious.

01:02.412 --> 01:03.337
Maybe delicious.

01:03.408 --> 01:06.206
Yeah, "Delicious" was the name I used to dance under.

01:09.232 --> 01:11.559
But that's behind me now. I'm in the big time.

01:12.953 --> 01:16.251
Yeah, woohoo! Look at this, the great view of LA.

01:18.607 --> 01:19.515
Are you still in Hawaii?

01:19.627 --> 01:22.592
Yes, I do live in Hawaii, which is beautiful, beautiful.

01:23.853 --> 01:25.102
And I'm still on the show.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.659
Right, 'cause we keep getting people from "Lost" and then...

01:28.061 --> 01:31.774
And then we're, right, people do get killed off quite often.
