Welcome to HouseholdHacker.

00:12.806 --> 00:15.073
We're gonna show you how to make a can safe.

00:15.618 --> 00:20.607
You need a can, a little jar, can opener and some hot glue.

00:21.118 --> 00:23.823
Make sure that your aerosol can is completely empty.

00:24.959 --> 00:27.940
And then take the can opener to the bottom, clip it,...

00:28.780 --> 00:30.853
...and spin it around until the bottom cuts off.

00:35.720 --> 00:38.227
Once you're done with that, clean it out.

00:40.198 --> 00:41.245
Remove the nozzle.

00:46.339 --> 00:47.518
Take the lid off your jar...

00:48.613 --> 00:51.791
...and glue it on to the bottom portion of the aerosol can.

01:04.613 --> 01:06.586
Now, take your empty can and stuff it.

01:08.277 --> 01:09.514
You can use anything you want here.

01:09.634 --> 01:12.997
If you want it to be heavier, then use a caulking compound.

01:13.996 --> 01:15.923
We're just going to use some paper towels though.

01:20.117 --> 01:21.263
Then take your jar,...

01:22.069 --> 01:22.919
...put some glue on it,...

01:24.463 --> 01:28.673
...and wrap some more paper towels around it so that it fits snugly inside of the aerosol can.

01:31.063 --> 01:31.616
Push it in.

01:35.669 --> 01:36.539
You're almost set here.

01:37.061 --> 01:40.627
Just throw some hot glue around the edges to make sure it will stay sealed.

01:45.619 --> 01:49.337
Take your lid, screw it in, and you're all set.

02:01.196 --> 02:03.615
Well, it looks like your can safe is finally complete.

02:04.264 --> 02:05.734
You can store anything you want here.

02:06.633 --> 02:09.985
Just be careful that no one sees you making it or the secret will be out.
