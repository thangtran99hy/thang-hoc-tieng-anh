This NASA animation shows what the US space agency expects to happen...

00:14.160 --> 00:17.600
...when the Curiosity rover completes its nine - month journey to Mars.

00:19.161 --> 00:22.150
A team of scientists has already selected the landing site:...

00:22.543 --> 00:27.915
...the foot of a mountain within a deep, 150 kilometer - wide depression called Gale Crater.

00:34.237 --> 00:38.667
After the parachute deploys, engines will start for a powered descent.

00:41.125 --> 00:43.137
Curiosity will be lowered on cables.

00:45.779 --> 00:51.055
And the rocket pack will blast off to an area where it will not affect the rover's chemical analysis equipment.

00:52.006 --> 00:55.765
Curiosity is the size of a car and has 17 cameras.

00:56.429 --> 00:59.121
The rover can use its drill to pulverize rocks...

00:59.389 --> 01:01.726
...and its robotic arm to collect powder samples.

01:03.807 --> 01:07.342
It then drops the samples into its own instruments for further analysis.

01:08.307 --> 01:14.139
The goal is to learn if Gale Crater ever had environmental conditions that could have supported microbial life.

01:14.455 --> 01:19.547
The mountain that is located within Gale Crater will yield plenty of information about the planet's evolution...

01:19.965 --> 01:22.515
...because each layer of rock contains clues.

01:22.861 --> 01:29.220
Curiosity and its spacecraft components are being assembled and undergoing final testing at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

01:29.767 --> 01:32.033
It is said to launch in November or December.

01:32.790 --> 01:34.817
