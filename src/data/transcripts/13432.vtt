A wise man once said,...

00:01.609 --> 00:05.007
..."A glass of milk a day will make you healthy, wealthy and wise."

00:05.447 --> 00:07.987
Well, what about sending secret messages with it?

00:08.352 --> 00:09.280
Can we do that too?

00:14.342 --> 00:16.404
Now, this is an incredibly easy trick to do.

00:16.521 --> 00:18.167
All you need to do is pour a glass of milk...

00:18.667 --> 00:19.893
...and then get a Q-Tip out.

00:20.366 --> 00:21.791
Draw your message out with a Q-Tip...

00:23.237 --> 00:25.320
...and then let it dry for at least 30 minutes.

00:25.894 --> 00:28.306
If you have a heat lamp or something, it might be fine but...

00:28.575 --> 00:29.248
...you know, whatever.

00:30.185 --> 00:32.573
When you're done, your paper should look normal.

00:35.581 --> 00:37.540
And once it looks like this, you're ready to go.

00:37.739 --> 00:38.915
Let's reveal the message.

00:39.747 --> 00:43.529
Take an iron and slowly go over the paper.

00:44.313 --> 00:48.265
What's gonna happen is that the fat in the milk is going to brown up...

00:48.526 --> 00:49.555
...as opposed to burn.

00:49.822 --> 00:52.999
And it will reveal the message that was stained into the paper itself.

00:55.287 --> 00:57.352
A pretty nifty and easy trick for you to try at home.

01:02.916 --> 01:05.969
So, that concludes season one of Scientific Tuesdays.

01:06.299 --> 01:09.390
If you enjoyed Scientific Tuesdays, make sure you check back in a couple of weeks...

01:09.705 --> 01:11.174
...when we start season two.

01:11.402 --> 01:12.187
You're gonna love it.

01:12.373 --> 01:13.113
I assure you.

01:13.321 --> 01:13.817
See you then.
