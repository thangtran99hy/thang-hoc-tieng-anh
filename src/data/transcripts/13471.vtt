What does the word "leadership" mean for you?

00:08.328 --> 00:09.398
Yeah, good question.

00:10.263 --> 00:11.541
Uh, difficult one.

00:12.027 --> 00:14.811
Leadership is motivating others in a group.

00:16.025 --> 00:18.189
It's the one who can take control.

00:18.327 --> 00:21.807
And guide for people in direction. It's sort of like a main idea.

00:22.467 --> 00:28.746
Inspiration, direction, encouragement, someone can be a leader...

00:28.851 --> 00:31.113
...of something even if they're not technically in charge of it.

00:31.603 --> 00:32.895
But it can also be inclusive,...

00:34.845 --> 00:37.552
...like getting people to have their own opinions.

00:37.897 --> 00:42.586
But after all, it's to control the given situation.

00:42.974 --> 00:46.090
Even though it's allowing people to have individual part within that.

00:46.307 --> 00:48.026
It's more about commanding things,...

00:48.104 --> 00:51.154
...someone taking over during the time when one is pressured...

00:51.567 --> 00:56.959
...in a job where a lot is going on and someone needs to take control of the situation.

00:57.799 --> 01:00.218
Leadership is controlling a group of people,...

01:01.650 --> 01:03.288
...in terms of a team.

01:05.051 --> 01:06.438
I think I haven't a clue.

01:07.135 --> 01:09.927
Have to be someone very strong as a personality,...

01:10.392 --> 01:15.284
...able to see what people need and what people strive for and help them to achieve this.

01:15.639 --> 01:17.811
Leadership is being able to inspire people...

01:17.881 --> 01:20.171
...to do what you think is the right thing for them to do,...

01:20.261 --> 01:24.044
...to be able to give them that motivation and encouragement to get the job done.

01:25.353 --> 01:29.435
Keeping people informed, obviously making the correct decisions.

01:30.231 --> 01:34.381
A place that's well-run, a good top-down management.

01:34.616 --> 01:36.155
Something that you have respect for.
