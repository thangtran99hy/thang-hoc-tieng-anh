Hi, my name is Jessica Claire.

00:01.709 --> 00:03.610
And I'm a professional dating coach here in New York City,...

00:04.012 --> 00:05.423
...for New York Dating Coach.

00:06.839 --> 00:09.867
In this clip we're going to talk about how to handle rejection...

00:10.379 --> 00:11.735
...when trying to meet women.

00:13.643 --> 00:15.636
First and foremost, it's important for you to know...

00:16.189 --> 00:18.937
...how many women there are out there.

00:20.011 --> 00:22.126
Do not get attached to one idea...

00:22.274 --> 00:24.372
...or to the idea of being with one woman.

00:24.789 --> 00:28.470
If you go into a club, there are a hundred girls there.

00:29.651 --> 00:34.137
It's safe to say there are at least 20 of those hundred girls that you'd be willing to date.

00:34.260 --> 00:35.975
So, if one of them rejects you,...

00:36.643 --> 00:39.038
...always keep in the back of your mind that there are 19 more...

00:39.492 --> 00:40.913
...you might have a better chance with.

00:41.383 --> 00:42.939
Also, don't blame yourself.

00:43.065 --> 00:44.889
It might have nothing to do with you.

00:45.608 --> 00:48.219
Rejection is something that people take personally...

00:48.705 --> 00:50.591
...but that is most likely not personal.

00:50.886 --> 00:55.905
She might already have a fella or maybe she's not even feeling up to even flirting that day.

00:55.990 --> 00:57.348
She wants to be with her girlfriends.

00:58.199 --> 01:01.933
Don't assume that the reason that she rejected you is for something that you did.

01:02.775 --> 01:05.090
Also, get used to it.

01:05.388 --> 01:08.613
Rejection is going to happen to you over and over, and over again in life.

01:08.757 --> 01:10.483
And it's the way that you face that rejection...

01:10.580 --> 01:14.574
...that's going to mean possibilities for you later on.

01:15.205 --> 01:17.164
Thanks for listening. This has been Jessica Claire.
