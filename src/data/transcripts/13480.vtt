00:00.073 --> 00:03.457
So you've come to a place and you need to introduce yourself.

00:03.690 --> 00:04.657
What are some tips?

00:04.763 --> 00:06.247
Well, let's talk about them more.

00:06.584 --> 00:10.193
I am Hazely Lopez from Hazely Academy of Refinement and Modeling...

00:10.597 --> 00:13.635
...and I'm here to talk to you about how to introduce yourself.

00:14.281 --> 00:18.262
When you enter a room, the most important thing is to be confident and secure about yourself.

00:18.719 --> 00:19.971
Always make eye contact.

00:20.390 --> 00:21.706
That says a lot about you.

00:22.371 --> 00:24.215
Also, when you introduce your name,...

00:24.498 --> 00:26.748
...you have to say your first and last name.

00:27.226 --> 00:31.614
Ask for the other party's names and follow that by repeating it.

00:31.821 --> 00:33.678
"It's nice to meet you, Mary."

00:34.765 --> 00:38.110
It's really important to always look for conversations.

00:38.482 --> 00:42.517
You may wanna tell them how you have some things in common to them...

00:42.903 --> 00:44.916
...or how do you know the host of the party.

00:45.307 --> 00:47.591
These are some ideas that you may think about.

00:47.709 --> 00:49.099
If you have a nickname,...

00:49.466 --> 00:52.497
...you may also tell them that when you're actually introducing yourself to them.

00:53.312 --> 00:55.589
Another thing to do is to always...

00:56.008 --> 00:58.052
...try to look for things about your background...

00:58.160 --> 00:59.613
...that you may wanna show that person.

00:59.987 --> 01:02.525
That can open to other conversations and...

01:02.971 --> 01:06.677
...to really have a good time and be confident and happy with yourself...

01:06.861 --> 01:07.803
...and with the other person.

01:08.461 --> 01:11.999

01:12.467 --> 01:13.767
...and it's a pleasure to meet you.
