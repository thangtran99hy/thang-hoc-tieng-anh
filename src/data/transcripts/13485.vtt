00:00.564 --> 00:02.941
So, you have been invited to a five-star restaurant,...

00:03.140 --> 00:04.498
...and it may sound really fancy.

00:04.656 --> 00:06.843
Let's take a look at some tips to know what to do.

00:07.296 --> 00:11.139
Hi, I'm Hazely Lopez from Hazely Academy of Refinement and Modeling...

00:11.453 --> 00:14.608
...and I'm here to talk to you about how to behave in a five-star restaurant.

00:15.328 --> 00:19.337
Well, you first may want to take a look at the menu before you actually get to the table.

00:19.729 --> 00:22.090
You wanna make sure that you're kind of familiar with,...

00:22.257 --> 00:23.791
...what you're gonna be eating in that night...

00:24.046 --> 00:27.278
...that's going to make it a lot easier to actually talk to the server...

00:27.362 --> 00:28.628
...when he comes and gets your order.

00:29.277 --> 00:33.073
You also wanna make sure that you make reservations and arrive early to them.

00:33.857 --> 00:37.320
Busy five-stars can be a little bit difficult to get in.

00:38.324 --> 00:41.393
You also wanna make sure that when you're eating,...

00:41.551 --> 00:45.912
...you put your napkin on your lap and once you're done,...

00:46.845 --> 00:48.520
...excuse me, before you're done,...

00:48.595 --> 00:50.829
...if you need to go stand up and you go to the bathroom,...

00:51.169 --> 00:52.601
...you leave the napkin on your chair.

00:52.963 --> 00:55.932
This will help the server know that you're not done.

00:56.449 --> 01:00.151
If you are done, you may set the table; you may set the napkin on the table.

01:01.241 --> 01:04.656
Also, you may want to ensure that you order appetizers.

01:04.905 --> 01:06.365
When you're in a five-star restaurant,...

01:06.582 --> 01:08.605
...it is expected to order appetizers.

01:08.915 --> 01:10.998
At the same time if you're ordering a wine,...

01:11.282 --> 01:13.781
...you better make sure that you ask for a suggestion.

01:14.128 --> 01:18.638
There are no returns for an open wine, unless there's something wrong with it.

01:19.546 --> 01:23.811
Also remember that "host eats before you do".

01:24.083 --> 01:26.094
So, make sure you give them that opportunity.

01:26.579 --> 01:29.713
