00:02.536 --> 00:05.334
Ramadan is considered the most venerated, blessed...

00:05.412 --> 00:08.461
...and spiritually beneficial month of the Islamic year.

00:09.015 --> 00:12.463
Prayers, fasting, charity and self-accountability...

00:12.601 --> 00:14.656
...are especially stressed at this time.

00:16.057 --> 00:20.280
Religious observances associated with Ramadan are kept throughout the month.

00:20.767 --> 00:24.329
Fasting is prescribed daily for all able adult Muslims...

00:24.423 --> 00:26.013
...during the whole month of Ramadan,...

00:26.329 --> 00:28.601
...beginning with the sighting of the new moon.

00:30.479 --> 00:32.397
During Ramadan in the Muslim world,...

00:32.509 --> 00:35.431
...most restaurants are closed during the daylight hours.

00:36.639 --> 00:41.105
Families get up early for Suhoor, a meal eaten before the sun rises.

00:41.355 --> 00:45.392
After the sun sets, the fast is broken with the meal known as Iftar.

00:46.712 --> 00:49.914
Iftar usually begins with dates and sweet drinks...

00:49.994 --> 00:51.925
...that provide a quick energy boost.

00:53.823 --> 00:55.847
Fasting serves many purposes.

00:55.949 --> 00:57.640
While they are hungry and thirsty,...

00:57.720 --> 01:00.363
...Muslims are reminded of the suffering of the poor.

01:00.813 --> 01:03.863
Fasting is also an opportunity to practice self-control...

01:03.965 --> 01:06.051
...and to cleanse the body and mind.

01:06.378 --> 01:08.019
And in this most sacred month,...

01:08.261 --> 01:12.453
...fasting helps Muslims feel the peace that comes from spiritual devotion,...

01:12.611 --> 01:15.409
...as well as kinship with fellow believers.
