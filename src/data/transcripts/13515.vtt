Ramadan is the name of the 9th month of the Islamic moon calendar.

00:22.363 --> 00:26.240
It is very important because it is the month in which the glorious Koran...

00:26.471 --> 00:30.999
...was first sent down by Allah to the prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wa Sallam.

00:32.482 --> 00:34.931
During Ramadan, Muslims must fast...

00:35.651 --> 00:38.285
...we don't eat or drink between dawn and sunset.

00:38.913 --> 00:42.068
And we should be very careful to speak and behave in the right way.

00:43.701 --> 00:46.274
We learn many things from fasting during Ramadan.

00:47.461 --> 00:49.864
It is a time to increase our remembrance of Allah...

00:50.279 --> 00:52.388
...and remember the blessings which we have been given.

00:58.461 --> 01:02.001
We learn how to be thankful for the good things that we normally take for granted.

01:03.485 --> 01:07.869
After fasting all day, we realize just how wonderful food and drink taste.

01:08.381 --> 01:13.857
So, we thank Allah more sincerely for providing us with enough to eat and satisfy our thirst.

01:15.595 --> 01:17.869
Ramadan is a good form of training.

01:19.088 --> 01:22.417
There may come moments or times in life when things are not easy...

01:22.873 --> 01:25.055
...and we have to carry on even though it is difficult.

01:26.155 --> 01:29.376
By fasting, we learn to be patient at such times...

01:29.682 --> 01:31.528
...and to control ourselves and our bodies.

01:32.197 --> 01:34.005
This is called self - discipline.

01:35.969 --> 01:39.608
During this holy month, the prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wa Sallam said,...

01:40.967 --> 01:44.785
..."The doors of heaven are opened and the doors of hell closed."

01:45.358 --> 01:46.607
"And the devils are chained."

01:48.620 --> 01:50.877
This helps us to see ourselves as we really are,...

01:51.465 --> 01:53.863
...not under the influence of unseen evil forces.

01:54.807 --> 01:56.773
We can watch and improve ourselves more,...

01:57.257 --> 02:00.264
...especially by reading the Koran and going to the mosque,...

02:00.688 --> 02:02.461
...joining in for Tarawih prayers.

02:14.191 --> 02:18.935
In Ramadan, there is a special night that is better than 1,000 months.

02:19.488 --> 02:21.628
It is called "Laylatul Qadr",...

02:22.503 --> 02:25.062
...the night in which the Koran was first revealed;...

02:25.849 --> 02:29.031
...a night in which all our sins can be forgiven.

02:37.133 --> 02:41.263
Fasting is also important because it makes the rich equal to the poor.

02:41.977 --> 02:45.705
It gives them a chance to realize what life is like for the less fortunate:...

02:45.990 --> 02:47.633
...those who have little or no food.

02:48.768 --> 02:50.613
This helps them become more charitable...

02:51.145 --> 02:53.323
...and give generously of their wealth to the needy...

02:54.039 --> 02:57.357
...so that they too can enjoy and share the blessings of Allah...

02:58.009 --> 02:59.098
...which are enough for all.
