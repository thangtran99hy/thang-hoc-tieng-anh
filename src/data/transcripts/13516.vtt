Hundreds of millions of users of social networks around the world...

00:09.290 --> 00:13.365
...have completely changed the view of communicating online, building your brand.

00:13.677 --> 00:16.219
It used to be your site being at the center.

00:16.617 --> 00:22.119
It used to be Google. You had to make your site searchable and accessible through search engines.

00:22.502 --> 00:25.294
Now it's all about being shareable.

00:25.435 --> 00:30.405
It's not only about Twitter and Facebook, of course, which are kind of the two main drivers of growth.

00:30.471 --> 00:33.578
It can be professional social networks such as LinkedIn.

00:34.271 --> 00:39.240

00:39.309 --> 00:41.267
...such as YouTube or Flickr.

00:41.797 --> 00:45.113
Videos and pictures can be very, very powerful.

00:45.238 --> 00:47.754
And they are social networks because there are comments,...

00:48.168 --> 00:52.295
...you can get followers and following on Flickr and on YouTube...

00:52.365 --> 00:53.375
...and in so many others.

00:53.465 --> 00:59.731
