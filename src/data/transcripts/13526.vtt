Once upon a time, there was the telephone.

00:04.383 --> 00:06.692
And the great thing was that every telephone...

00:07.083 --> 00:09.772
...could talk to every other telephone in the world.

00:10.249 --> 00:11.193
Everybody was happy.

00:17.085 --> 00:17.581
So, this...

00:17.683 --> 00:18.310
...is the era.

00:19.668 --> 00:21.143
With billions of users,...

00:21.295 --> 00:24.114
...millions of opportunities, hundreds of original flavors,...

00:24.707 --> 00:26.035
...and hundreds of heavy operators.

00:28.589 --> 00:30.009
Millions of opportunities,...

00:31.400 --> 00:32.644
...billions of users...

00:33.435 --> 00:34.654
...but what's the effect?

00:36.455 --> 00:41.593
IPTV gives you the freedom to watch content when you want it on demand.

00:42.515 --> 00:42.991
Nice!

00:47.148 --> 00:50.391
We at Ericsson don't leave guarding the perimeters.

00:51.113 --> 00:52.835
