00:01.477 --> 00:06.736
Since the dawn of mankind, battles have been waged between visionaries and skeptics.

00:08.887 --> 00:12.016
Skeptics look at the world as it is and ask, "Why?"

00:13.027 --> 00:14.740
Visionaries ask, "Why not?"

00:16.627 --> 00:21.784
Copernicus, Darwin, Edison and Einstein, they were all ridiculed.

00:24.419 --> 00:25.953
People only believe in what they see.

00:26.996 --> 00:30.822
The distance between insanity and genius is measured only by success.

00:31.979 --> 00:34.095
People laughed at Lars Magnus Ericsson as well,...

00:35.123 --> 00:39.164
...a country boy travelling to Stockholm, with a dream of starting a telegraph business.

00:40.111 --> 00:41.986
Those laughs turned into admiration.

00:43.367 --> 00:45.779
But along the journey, other skeptics appeared.

00:46.929 --> 00:48.093
Decisions were questioned.

00:51.181 --> 00:55.599
"Is it really wise to go from the prosperous graph to the uncertain phone?", people asked.

00:58.715 --> 01:00.365
And when the phone had finally conquered,...

01:01.179 --> 01:04.529
...there was more hesitation around the move to the new world of mobility.

01:07.077 --> 01:09.246
Can the mobile Internet ever be a reality?

01:12.735 --> 01:16.449
Time and again, Ericsson silenced the critics.

01:17.925 --> 01:23.161
Today questions swirl around Ericsson's newest venture, Multimedia.

01:25.227 --> 01:28.262
Are you a skeptic or a visionary?
