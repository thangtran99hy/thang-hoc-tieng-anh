Now, when you're receiving phone calls, there's a couple of things that you must do.

00:06.560 --> 00:09.277
First of all, you want to answer that phone promptly.

00:09.900 --> 00:14.125
Ring one, ring two, ring three; "Hello, this is Tracy."

00:14.743 --> 00:17.345
By three rings, you should pick up that phone.

00:17.919 --> 00:22.460
And what you also want to do is you want to have a smile in your voice.

00:22.741 --> 00:23.975
See, I can't see your face.

00:24.570 --> 00:27.015
So I want to say, "Hey, this is Tracy. Hello."...

00:27.750 --> 00:29.501
...alright? Or however you answer the phone...

00:30.071 --> 00:36.801
...because a smile in your voice will present you as positive and helpful,...

00:37.404 --> 00:39.248
...and what you want to do immediately is find out...

00:39.900 --> 00:42.078
...who you're calling and how you can help them.

00:42.653 --> 00:47.322
Those are just essential things that you have to do when you answer the phone.

00:48.585 --> 00:51.625
Go back and think about tone and all of those things.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.800
You don't want to answer your phone after it's been ringing seven times,...

00:57.230 --> 00:57.733
..."This is Tracy."

00:58.731 --> 01:01.091
Okay, what's my customer going to think?

01:02.035 --> 01:04.153
My caller's going to be afraid, very afraid.

01:04.725 --> 01:09.501
So be positive, be professional, give a smile to that hello.
