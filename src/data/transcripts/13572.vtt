00:00.221 --> 00:03.191
Ours was the first revolution in the history of mankind...

00:03.817 --> 00:06.033
...that truly reversed the course of government...

00:06.624 --> 00:08.311
...and with three little words:...

00:09.189 --> 00:10.478
..."We, the people."

00:11.645 --> 00:14.257
We, the people tell the government what to do;...

00:14.695 --> 00:15.951
...it doesn't tell us.

00:16.516 --> 00:17.933
We, the people are the driver;...

00:18.459 --> 00:19.715
...the government is the car...

00:20.222 --> 00:24.249
..and we decide where it should go and by what route, and how fast.

00:25.092 --> 00:28.832
Almost all the world's constitutions are documents in which governments...

00:29.303 --> 00:31.463
...tell the people what their privileges are.

00:32.460 --> 00:35.765
Our constitution is a document in which we, the people...

00:36.471 --> 00:39.423
...tell the government what it is allowed to do.

00:40.551 --> 00:42.418
We, the people are free.

00:43.621 --> 00:48.155
This belief has been the underlying basis for everything I've tried to do these past eight years.

00:48.912 --> 00:51.599
But back in the 1960s when I began,...

00:52.233 --> 00:55.096
...it seemed to me that we'd begun reversing the order of things;...

00:55.822 --> 00:59.755
...that through more and more rules and regulations and confiscatory taxes,...

01:00.320 --> 01:05.854
...the government was taking more of our money, more of our options, and more of our freedom.

01:07.329 --> 01:11.926
I went into politics in part to put up my hand and say, "Stop."

01:12.581 --> 01:16.487
I was a citizen politician and it seemed the right thing for a citizen to do.

01:17.601 --> 01:20.257
I think we have stopped a lot of what needed stopping.

01:20.975 --> 01:27.800
And I hope we have once again reminded people that man is not free unless government is limited.

01:28.616 --> 01:33.138
There's a clear cause and effect here that is as neat and predictable as a law of physics:...

01:33.700 --> 01:37.579
...as government expands, liberty contracts.
