00:00.075 --> 00:06.465
Alright now, let's talk about the professional way to end this conversation.

00:06.977 --> 00:12.406
Just like the beginning of the conversation might have seemed a little bit formal to you,...

00:12.805 --> 00:16.007
...the ending might seem a little formal to you, as well.

00:16.091 --> 00:18.333
What you traditionally want to do,...

00:18.664 --> 00:25.665
...is give a brief wrap-up or summary or reiteration of what the solution...

00:25.778 --> 00:28.561
...or what was the outcome of the phone conversation.

00:29.095 --> 00:32.059
OK so, we're going to change part A,...

00:32.440 --> 00:33.793
...we're gonna leave part B,...

00:33.884 --> 00:35.941
...and we're going to cut out part C.

00:36.681 --> 00:39.077
Whatever happened in that conversation,...

00:39.153 --> 00:41.168
...you don't have to repeat the whole conversation,...

00:41.537 --> 00:44.327
...but just restate it in a sentence or two.

00:44.990 --> 00:50.552
It is always proper business etiquette, at the end of a phone conversation,...

00:50.895 --> 00:55.422
...to say something like, "Thank you, I'll see you Friday."

00:56.068 --> 00:57.675
"Thank you for your time."

01:00.138 --> 01:01.669
"Thank you for your business."

01:01.961 --> 01:04.455
Alright? "Thank you" for something.

01:05.085 --> 01:07.380
It doesn't have to be just a random "thank you",...

01:07.739 --> 01:09.833
...but it could be a random "thank you",...

01:09.953 --> 01:13.721
...or it could be a "thank you", specific to something.

01:14.304 --> 01:15.929
And then, you just simply say, "Goodbye."

01:16.821 --> 01:25.260
You know, you wanna avoid some of the more contemporary slang terms for goodbye like "Later dude."

01:25.790 --> 01:27.261
Okay? You wanna stay away from that.

01:27.386 --> 01:30.253
Just simply, "Thank you for your time. Goodbye."

01:30.679 --> 01:32.709
"Thank you for your time and I'll see you Friday."

01:33.107 --> 01:34.357
"Thank you, I'll see you Friday."

01:34.453 --> 01:36.023
"Thank you, Bob. Goodbye."

01:36.847 --> 01:38.287
Alright? Leave it at that.

01:38.543 --> 01:39.757
That is professional.
