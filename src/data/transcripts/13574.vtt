Ever wonder what it takes to be a beauty queen?

00:05.907 --> 00:08.602
Hi, I'm Justin Popovics, a pageant fitness trainer...

00:08.928 --> 00:13.040
...and official fitness trainer for Miss New York, New Hampshire and Florida USA.

00:13.633 --> 00:18.237
Here are some tips and tricks of the trade that you can take along with you in your quest for the crown.

00:23.093 --> 00:25.812
In a beauty pageant, introductions are critical.

00:25.973 --> 00:31.413
It gives you the opportunity to tell the judges who you are, where you're from, and what your goal is...

00:31.518 --> 00:32.995
...which ultimately is the crown.

00:33.587 --> 00:37.157
Today, I'm gonna teach you how to do your own pageant intro.

00:38.113 --> 00:40.479
Think about who you are and where you're from...

00:40.722 --> 00:42.222
...and some of the landmarks in your state.

00:42.748 --> 00:46.785
Then put them together in a nice sound bite that's fun and catchy.

00:47.516 --> 00:48.219
For example:...

00:49.215 --> 00:55.615
"From the Statue of Liberty to Lake Ontario, I'm proud to represent the Empire State of New York."

00:56.130 --> 00:58.673
"From Manhattan, I'm Justin Popovics."

00:59.903 --> 01:02.713
Let's do that one more time, but a little more slowly.

01:03.427 --> 01:11.623
"From the Statue of Liberty to Lake Ontario, I'm proud to represent the Empire State of New York."

01:12.062 --> 01:15.019
"From Manhattan, I'm Justin Popovics."
