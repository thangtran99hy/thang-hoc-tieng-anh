Hi, I'm Marya Choby and I'm a dating coach.

00:03.195 --> 00:06.515
I'm sharing dating strategies for shy and introverted singles.

00:07.119 --> 00:09.947
Right now, I'm going to talk about how to meet people to date.

00:11.439 --> 00:15.078
The number one way to meet new people is to be introduced by friends.

00:15.907 --> 00:17.188
But if you want to get set up,...

00:17.601 --> 00:21.417
...you have to let your friends know you're interested and available to be set up.

00:22.249 --> 00:25.254
Make friends with people of all genders and all ages.

00:25.956 --> 00:27.827
You'll get comfortable in the environment...

00:28.081 --> 00:30.379
...and have friendly, supportive people around you.

00:31.437 --> 00:34.311
Build communities around your passions and interests.

00:34.788 --> 00:38.989
Attend lectures, take classes and participate in individual sports...

00:39.344 --> 00:41.616
...like biking or hiking with the group.

00:43.140 --> 00:44.606
Consider online dating.

00:45.131 --> 00:48.673
Don't be afraid to convey your richness and depth in your profile.

00:49.635 --> 00:53.925
Give yourself the opportunity to talk on the phone a few times before meeting...

00:54.187 --> 00:55.596
...to increase your comfort level.

00:56.654 --> 00:58.602
So, what about parties and bars?

00:58.944 --> 01:01.457
Learn to spot other introverts to chat with.

01:02.071 --> 01:04.119
They'll be relieved you're talking with them...

01:04.365 --> 01:06.683
...and happy to be exempt from working the room.

01:08.414 --> 01:10.355
Also, try to find yourself a chair.

01:10.705 --> 01:13.626
You'll feel safer and more grounded if you can sit down.

01:15.456 --> 01:19.162
If you run into someone worth meeting, it's great if you can get introduced.

01:20.117 --> 01:22.263
If not, consider taking the initiative.

01:23.515 --> 01:25.970
Being an introvert doesn't mean you can't be assertive.

01:26.533 --> 01:29.387
You'll just want to break the interaction into small chunks.

01:30.272 --> 01:34.597
Make eye contact and smile when you're one-on-one at the food table or bar.

01:35.187 --> 01:38.231
A little later, say hello again and smile.

01:38.583 --> 01:40.691
You'll feel like old friends by the end of the night.

01:42.179 --> 01:44.607
So, those are some strategies for meeting people to date.
