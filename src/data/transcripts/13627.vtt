00:04.100 --> 00:08.424
"Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration,"...

00:08.927 --> 00:11.313
...Thomas Edison once told Harper's Magazine.

00:12.060 --> 00:14.132
With more than a thousand patents to his name,...

00:14.223 --> 00:17.793
...the inventor and entrepreneur embodied the American dream...

00:18.383 --> 00:20.717
...and inspired generations of scientists.

00:22.309 --> 00:26.215
Edison was born in Ohio in 1847 and grew up in Michigan.

00:26.763 --> 00:31.395
A restless precociously intelligent boy who always wanted to know why.

00:32.714 --> 00:35.583
After saving a young child from the path of a locomotive,...

00:35.972 --> 00:40.883
...15-year-old Edison was trained as a telegraph operator by the boy's grateful father...

00:41.408 --> 00:44.773
...and developed a lifelong interest in electric communications.

00:45.277 --> 00:48.975
By the early 1870s, Edison was America's leading telegraph inventor.

00:49.565 --> 00:53.639
And it was while experimenting with the transmitter that Edison stumbled on the invention...

00:53.711 --> 00:57.736
...that was to write his name in the history books, a tinfoil phonograph.

00:58.539 --> 01:03.324
In 1879, Edison invented the carbon filament for the incandescent light bulb.

01:04.097 --> 01:09.267
More than a hundred years later, a case of Edison's original light bulbs was rediscovered.

01:10.395 --> 01:14.519
Edison was a genius at foreseeing the potential commercial uses of his inventions.

01:15.247 --> 01:17.481
When the phonograph was first launched for sale,...

01:17.949 --> 01:21.601
...his suggestions for its exploitation included letter writing and dictating,...

01:22.203 --> 01:25.598
...preservation of family voices, spoken books for the blind,...

01:25.981 --> 01:29.064
...clocks that announce the time and telephone recordings.

01:31.612 --> 01:33.721
To utilize his light bulb technology,...

01:34.023 --> 01:37.137
...Edison swiftly patented an electrical distribution system.

01:38.003 --> 01:40.910
In 1882, he successfully delivered light and power...

01:41.008 --> 01:45.949
...through unique prototype electricity grids to cities in Massachusetts and New York.

01:47.237 --> 01:50.925
Edison had built his first dedicated laboratory in 1875.

01:51.523 --> 01:53.690
And he used his growing fame and fortune...

01:53.992 --> 01:57.747
...to build a state-of-the-art research and development center in 1887.

01:58.685 --> 02:02.977
He used the facility to improve his old inventions and create new ones...

02:03.501 --> 02:06.834
...that was in constant conflict with financiers and money managers.

02:07.773 --> 02:14.636
So in 1892, Edison merged his electrical companies into one giant firm, General Electric.

02:15.412 --> 02:18.751
The money he made from the stock enabled him to be fully self - financing.

02:19.410 --> 02:23.588
He plowed millions of dollars into an iron ore operation in northern New Jersey.

02:24.891 --> 02:27.302
Unfortunately, the venture was a financial failure,...

02:27.794 --> 02:30.315
...but Edison was wealthy enough to absorb the loss.

02:30.921 --> 02:33.504
Edison's lack of concern over his mining losses...

02:33.598 --> 02:36.573
...was due to his increasing successes in the recording industry,...

02:37.183 --> 02:39.095
...in the new world of moving pictures.

02:40.010 --> 02:43.311
In 1888, he filed a patent for a Kinetoscope,...

02:43.793 --> 02:48.361
...a device that would reproduce movement in the same way the phonograph reproduced sound.

02:49.291 --> 02:53.645
When Eastman Kodak began supplying motion picture film stock in 1893,...

02:54.047 --> 02:55.877
...Edison's vision could be realized.

02:56.271 --> 02:59.137
He joined forces with the inventors of a film projector...

02:59.549 --> 03:02.670
...and created films that screened around the United States.

03:03.129 --> 03:07.031
One of these was the earliest version of Frankenstein, made in 1910.

03:09.067 --> 03:13.550
Even as he reached his 80's, Edison stayed active and engaged in business and science.

03:14.011 --> 03:16.863
By that time, he was one of the world's greatest celebrities.
