Ashton and company's hip, comfort food joint is next on Grubber's Delight.

00:16.405 --> 00:20.511
Hey there, food lovers! I'm Catherine Cronenberg and you're watching Grubber's Delight,...

00:20.768 --> 00:24.032
...the best show on the Internet for anybody who loves to eat.

00:24.580 --> 00:28.009
We've been taking a look at the best celeb-owned eateries around LA,...

00:28.184 --> 00:32.333
...and Ketchup in West Hollywood offers comfort food from the stars.

00:32.775 --> 00:37.768
"That '70s Show" stars Ashton Kutcher, Wilmer Valderrama, and Danny Masterson...

00:37.852 --> 00:39.785
...are among the investors in Ketchup,...

00:40.195 --> 00:43.343
...and its sister restaurants, Dolce and the Geisha House,...

00:43.648 --> 00:46.820
...that make it the hippest place to get meat loaf in the city.

00:47.426 --> 00:51.291
Ketchup mixes comfort food styles with a hip, upscale vibe,...

00:51.383 --> 00:57.562
...offering a menu of burgers, ribs, sloppy joes, battered chicken, and yes, meatloaf...

00:57.997 --> 01:01.567
...that will remind you of home while surprising you with their gourmet tastes.

01:02.449 --> 01:03.803
The restaurant takes its name...

01:03.878 --> 01:07.765
...from the fact that their menu features five different flavors of ketchup,...

01:08.081 --> 01:11.688
...and the place's white tables and booths are bathed in a red glow...

01:11.771 --> 01:13.390
...to add to the tomato theming.

01:14.095 --> 01:18.267
And even though the prices at Ketchup are a bit pricey for burgers and meat loaf,...

01:18.585 --> 01:22.045
...you can save lots of money by going to the restaurant on Sundays,...

01:22.125 --> 01:23.907
...when everything is half off.

01:24.329 --> 01:27.859
Just be warned, if you do go on Sundays, you'll miss bartender...

01:27.932 --> 01:31.320
...who wheels a cart of free, mini martinis around the restaurant...

01:31.492 --> 01:32.784
...every other night of the week.

01:33.261 --> 01:35.999
So, you're left with a choice of saving money on food...

01:36.385 --> 01:40.650
...or getting free specialty martinis approved by the stars of "That '70s Show".

01:41.269 --> 01:44.655
There are so many tough choices for LA citizens to make.

01:45.263 --> 01:49.005
I'm Catherine Cronenberg for Grubber's Delight, reminding you to eat well.
