The son of a late Beatle makes beautiful sushi in Los Angeles, next on Grubber's Delight.

00:17.974 --> 00:21.988
Hey there food lovers. I'm Catherine Cronenberg and you're watching Grubber's Delight,...

00:22.134 --> 00:25.424
...the best show on the Internet for anybody who loves to eat.

00:25.906 --> 00:28.054
We're running down a list of some of the hippest...

00:28.229 --> 00:30.521
...and tastiest celebrity-owned restaurants.

00:30.925 --> 00:34.879
And next on our stop is a sushi bar owned by the son of a Beatle.

00:35.399 --> 00:38.295
John Lennon may have declared, "I am the walrus,"...

00:38.542 --> 00:42.403
...but his son Julian is becoming the king of uncooked fish,...

00:42.502 --> 00:46.379
...as his West Hollywood hotspot "Blowfish Sushi to Die For"...

00:46.868 --> 00:50.541
...has become a popular hangout for the young, hot and famous.

00:51.047 --> 00:56.529
With a quirky menu featuring such items as Godzilla, Animal Style and Ego Rolls,...

00:56.908 --> 00:59.835
...and delicious specialty drinks like none other,...

01:00.162 --> 01:02.551
...it's no surprise that the place is popular.

01:02.995 --> 01:07.274
But with its nightclub-like atmosphere of thumping dance music, suede walls,...

01:07.370 --> 01:10.363
...and flat screen TVs playing Japanese anime,...

01:10.814 --> 01:14.667
...it becomes clear pretty quickly why the hip and fun sushi joint...

01:14.761 --> 01:18.832
...is one of the most popular in town, filled with great sushi choices.

01:19.418 --> 01:23.519
And when the son of one of the most famous and beloved musicians of all time...

01:23.597 --> 01:25.794
...is the owner, it doesn't hurt either.

01:26.445 --> 01:30.163
I'm Catherine Cronenberg  for Grubber's Delight, reminding you to eat well.
