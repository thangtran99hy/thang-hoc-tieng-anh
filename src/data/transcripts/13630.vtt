There's nothing worse than making a faux pas on a business trip.

00:02.771 --> 00:04.611
And honestly, I've a lot of questions about etiquette.

00:05.017 --> 00:05.925
There's only one thing to do.

00:08.119 --> 00:12.536
I'm here with an etiquette expert Julie Hirst to get some answers, finally.

00:12.605 --> 00:15.098
Now Julie, who gets the tip in the hotel and how do we leave that to?

00:15.317 --> 00:16.675
Everybody who provides a service.

00:16.765 --> 00:18.332
So, let's say it's a valet.

00:18.613 --> 00:19.350
You're pulling up,...

00:19.534 --> 00:23.071
...you tip the person who was opening the door for you one to two dollars.

00:23.150 --> 00:23.493
Okay.

00:23.720 --> 00:26.128
And then you have the porter or the bellman...

00:26.295 --> 00:29.220
...and he too gets one to two dollars per bag.

00:29.409 --> 00:29.941
Per bag?

00:30.003 --> 00:31.059
Per bag, correct.

00:31.431 --> 00:35.146
Well actually, I've just been clued in for today's interview...

00:35.475 --> 00:38.631
...is that people get tips like maids.

00:38.733 --> 00:41.147
It is customary to leave three dollars per night.

00:41.380 --> 00:44.403
And you would put it, if there's an envelope provided for you,...

00:44.484 --> 00:45.677
...then it goes in that envelope.

00:45.763 --> 00:48.712
If there's not, then you will pull out your envelope...

00:48.781 --> 00:51.146
...and put housekeeping or the housekeeper's name...

00:51.857 --> 00:53.413
...and then leave it on the desk.

00:54.831 --> 00:56.807
What do I do about the guilt that I'm feeling...

00:56.939 --> 00:59.889
...that I have stayed in so many hotels in my life and didn't know that?

00:59.993 --> 01:00.573
Any thoughts?

01:00.886 --> 01:04.183
Well, you could go back to all the hotels you've stayed at and say, "I'm so sorry!"

01:05.317 --> 01:06.763
You go back and look at season one,...

01:06.831 --> 01:09.661
...that is 40-something hotels from Boston to Los Angeles.

01:09.730 --> 01:11.727
So, coming up on season three of "The Smart Show,"...

01:11.799 --> 01:13.435
...Henry making up for his faux pas...

01:13.511 --> 01:16.639
...from coast-to-coast, hotel to hotel, making up for what he's done wrong.

01:16.751 --> 01:18.465
But from here on now, now you know.

01:18.666 --> 01:21.826
You are now socially savvy to go out and travel the proper way.

01:22.173 --> 01:23.768
And so there are no more excuses.

01:23.901 --> 01:24.665
Julie, thank you so much!

01:24.789 --> 01:25.278
Thank you!
