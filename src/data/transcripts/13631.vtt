Do you know that the roller coaster as we know it now is truly an evolutionary thing?

00:07.259 --> 00:09.362
It was originally an ice slide.

00:10.057 --> 00:13.257
And even though we don't think of it as doing the luge,...

00:14.089 --> 00:17.149
...at one time in Eastern Europe, that's what they did.

00:17.699 --> 00:22.406
They had these slides that went up and down the hills,...

00:22.559 --> 00:24.213
...and they were packed with ice.

00:24.683 --> 00:31.990
And that's how they had all of the daring and exciting ride that you get with the roller coaster.

00:32.473 --> 00:36.851
It's the exhilaration and the feel of the speed that people like.

00:37.582 --> 00:42.724
And then, once it went to France and some other places that were in Southern Europe...

00:43.382 --> 00:46.197
...and didn't have so much ice and snow,...

00:46.747 --> 00:55.263
...someone had to come up with a way of making a rail for this inclined plane with a car.

00:55.969 --> 00:58.519
And then it became the roller coaster.

00:59.061 --> 01:07.313
And now with the history of Coney Island in the United States and many other places,...

01:07.883 --> 01:12.331
...the thing that an amusement park is known for is its roller coaster.

01:13.090 --> 01:17.615
Oftentimes, roller coasters are made of the wood base.

01:18.994 --> 01:21.951
Many times they're made with steel.

01:22.620 --> 01:25.970
Now, they get into the "loop the loop" kind of things.

01:26.045 --> 01:33.182
And they go for going backwards as well as forwards.

01:34.663 --> 01:40.441
There's a very, very big following for roller coasters.

01:40.537 --> 01:48.682
Oftentimes, people are parts of clubs that keep track of which roller coasters they've ridden on...

01:48.773 --> 01:55.093
...and which ones are the most famous, and how many roller coasters a certain amusement park has.

01:55.569 --> 01:58.219
It's often a big draw for the tourist.
