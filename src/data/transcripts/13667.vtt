Today, many of the best examples of innovation in business...

00:12.948 --> 00:17.109
...or in education or in society or government...

00:17.387 --> 00:20.132
...are coming from young people who are using the web.

00:20.605 --> 00:23.047
This is a powerful tool to change the model.

00:23.498 --> 00:28.092
So, this is a whole new mode of production that's emerging.

00:29.251 --> 00:33.437
The Internet is not about putting a video onto YouTube...

00:33.531 --> 00:38.119
...or creating a gardening community online or having a cool website or a government portal.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.517
This is a new mode of production that's emerging.

00:41.821 --> 00:47.068
It's beginning to fundamentally change the way that we orchestrate capability in society...

00:47.766 --> 00:51.766
...to innovate, to create goods and services, to govern, to educate.

00:52.743 --> 00:53.912
That's the meaning of the web.
