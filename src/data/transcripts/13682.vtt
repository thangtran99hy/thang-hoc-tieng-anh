This growing awareness of a larger, more global audience...

00:11.046 --> 00:12.831
...has realigned the industry from the bottom up.

00:15.123 --> 00:17.657
A lot of things have changed. In the early 90s, for example,...

00:17.974 --> 00:21.237
...if some other party from the US calls our office and says "hello", our...

00:21.517 --> 00:24.136
...receptionists would hang up because they can't communicate, you know.

00:24.653 --> 00:27.226
And that was kind of the way it was back in the day.

00:27.455 --> 00:30.383
Now, you got a whole international staff...

00:30.936 --> 00:34.133
...alloted for English speaking. We're more international in terms of...

00:34.299 --> 00:35.118
...business structure.

00:38.651 --> 00:42.456
In terms of creativity, you're dealing with the international market, so...

00:42.996 --> 00:46.579
...the music itself has progressed to sort of meet that need.

00:47.007 --> 00:48.197
It's become more global.

00:48.914 --> 00:52.557
It's got basically the elements of pop for what it is, you know.

01:02.063 --> 01:05.997
In the last five years, you notice a huge improvement in the quality of the songs.

01:06.327 --> 01:09.580
The performance, the music videos, the styling, I think...

01:09.935 --> 01:13.083
...the Korean, as a society, is really great at studying...

01:15.706 --> 01:19.457
...success models and really adopting those success models and...

01:20.087 --> 01:21.257
...creating something really great.

01:21.508 --> 01:24.725
There are a lot of trial and error and perhaps maybe more misses...

01:25.179 --> 01:26.423
...which have created hits.

01:27.273 --> 01:30.334
A lot of the top Korean songs that not only do well here in...

01:30.412 --> 01:34.449
...Korea but beyond Korea, all seem to share similar characteristics.

01:45.147 --> 01:47.507
Although music is very much an oral experience,...

01:48.118 --> 01:49.292
...I think what makes K-pop...

01:49.409 --> 01:52.317
...so appealing at the moment is it's actually also visual experience.

02:02.231 --> 02:06.387
With the power of things like Youtube, using videos has gone through a bit of a renaissance...

02:06.909 --> 02:08.357
...in ways very unexpected.

02:09.269 --> 02:12.044
If you look at a lot of the biggest K-pop hits,...

02:12.741 --> 02:17.060
...yes, they had great-looking music videos but what made those great songs...

02:17.235 --> 02:19.591
...really take off was actually the viral videos.

02:19.759 --> 02:21.992
The videos that weren't even made by the artists...

02:22.109 --> 02:25.001
...or by the management or by the label. It's made by the fans.

02:25.589 --> 02:28.539
And so for instance, when a hit song that not only has...

02:28.949 --> 02:33.523
...sort of the catchy beats and the catchy chorus but also have a catchy dance moves,...

02:33.857 --> 02:37.733
...and you start seeing people from all walks of life copying those moves,...

02:38.573 --> 02:39.745
...you know you've got something.

02:46.612 --> 02:49.985
Korean management companies, they are not only able to...

02:50.309 --> 02:53.401
...claim the copyright on the songs that are being used on these videos...

02:53.525 --> 02:56.560
...but more importantly, they can attach ads and monetize it.
