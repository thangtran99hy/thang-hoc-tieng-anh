I don't think education is about teaching people.

00:08.093 --> 00:09.461
I think it's about people learning.

00:11.081 --> 00:12.629
And there's a big difference.

00:13.953 --> 00:19.745
One of my first math teachers, you know, he said he's going to respect us not for the answers we give...

00:19.871 --> 00:21.251
...but for the questions we ask.

00:22.217 --> 00:24.499
And he turned my learning world upside down.

00:24.613 --> 00:29.145
Because how I have to listen to something in order to ask an intelligent question....

00:30.033 --> 00:34.407
...is a lot more than how I have to listen in order to give an intelligent answer.

00:35.156 --> 00:38.799
Because, you know, an intelligent answer you can do half - asleep.

00:39.633 --> 00:42.053
An intelligent question you have to have at least one eye open.

00:47.749 --> 00:49.767
When my kids started playing with Wikipedia,...

00:49.949 --> 00:54.106
...they were being accused of, you know, "That's not the way to do your homework."

00:55.417 --> 00:57.198
Now, what am I expecting to see?

00:57.889 --> 01:03.147
We are already at the stage where an enlightened teacher will tell their students,...

01:03.607 --> 01:05.513
..."Your job is to write a Wikipedia article."

01:08.142 --> 01:14.582
And then the power of saying, "Wow, immediately I'm gonna put something up that 300 million people are gonna read."

01:15.589 --> 01:16.829
"I'd better get this right."

01:18.561 --> 01:20.179
Human beings like participating.

01:20.277 --> 01:21.726
Human beings like doing things.

01:22.310 --> 01:24.242
They like a level of variety in what they do.

01:24.305 --> 01:26.006
They like a level of freedom in what they do.

01:26.671 --> 01:27.803
And we've lost all these.

01:27.894 --> 01:33.923
So, I think you'll suddenly find that the idea of a school having walls disappears, okay.

01:35.383 --> 01:36.491
Parents are part of a school.

01:37.475 --> 01:38.592
Friends are part of a school.

01:39.426 --> 01:41.053
That's why I say learning is a philosophy.

01:41.132 --> 01:42.026
It's a state of mind.
