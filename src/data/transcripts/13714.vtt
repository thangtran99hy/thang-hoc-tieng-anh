As the global music market shifts from a tangible product to a digital one,...

00:05.564 --> 00:08.095
...the very nature of what the industry sells is changing.

00:09.036 --> 00:11.749
With so much content instantly accessible across the world...

00:12.084 --> 00:15.403
...acts succeed not by selling music but by selling sensation.

00:15.863 --> 00:18.581
A product that readily crosses language and cultural barriers.

00:19.338 --> 00:24.351
The cold, hard reality right now is music is actually no longer the business.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.857
If anything, it's become a business card.

00:29.192 --> 00:33.063
If it becomes popular, it leads to other opportunities.

00:33.199 --> 00:35.271
That is where they make money.

00:36.598 --> 00:39.145
I think if you're working in music, if you're a group,...

00:39.505 --> 00:43.747
...then it's really creating your brand is your core and...

00:43.970 --> 00:46.028
...with Korean society, I think branding of their groups,...

00:46.127 --> 00:51.077
...that's one thing that you really, really wanna win, really much better than probably most people.

00:51.454 --> 00:52.850
I think that's what the Americans used to do well.

00:55.098 --> 00:58.285
It really harks back to the Madonna, Michael Jackson days of...

00:58.780 --> 01:00.999
...superhero pop performance. That's what sort of...

01:01.612 --> 01:05.523
...gets people talking in an age with chatter is the main currency. Then,...

01:05.869 --> 01:06.713
...that's what you've gotta do.

01:09.418 --> 01:12.774
The second wave of Korean music has taken a prominent global position.

01:12.877 --> 01:13.838
Thanks to social media.

01:14.994 --> 01:18.913
How long this wave lasts will depend entirely on how those artists and taste - makers...

01:18.996 --> 01:22.462
...continue to adopt the mercurial winds of technology and culture.

01:23.368 --> 01:25.959
In Seoul for Monocle, I'm Jonathan Openshaw.
