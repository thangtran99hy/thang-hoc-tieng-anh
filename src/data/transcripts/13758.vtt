Some of you have heard the story before,...

00:16.893 --> 00:21.472
...but in fact, there's somebody in the audience who's never heard this story in front of an audience, before,...

00:21.545 --> 00:25.969
...so I'm a little more nervous than I normally am telling this story.

00:26.384 --> 00:28.412
I used to be a photographer for many years.

00:28.473 --> 00:35.482
In 1978, I was working for Time magazine, and I was given a three - day assignment to photograph Amerasian children,...

00:35.567 --> 00:39.777
...children who had been fathered by American GIs all over Southeast Asia, and then abandoned.

00:40.071 --> 00:41.883
40,000 children all over Asia.

00:42.316 --> 00:44.129
I had never heard the word "Amerasian" before.

00:45.145 --> 00:48.206
I spent a few days photographing children in different countries...

00:48.709 --> 00:53.971
...and like a lot of photographers and a lot of journalists, I always hope that when my pictures were published,...

00:54.325 --> 00:57.600
...they might actually have an effect on a situation instead of just documenting it.

00:58.313 --> 01:06.342
So, I was so disturbed by what I saw and I was so unhappy with the article that ran afterwards...

01:06.838 --> 01:09.253
...that I decided I would take six months off.

01:09.333 --> 01:10.337
I was 28 years old.

01:10.757 --> 01:16.261
I decided I would find six children in different countries and actually go spend some time with the kids...

01:16.345 --> 01:20.383
...and try to tell their story a little bit better than I thought I had done for Time magazine.

01:21.913 --> 01:28.789
In the course of doing the story, I was looking for children who hadn't been photographed before,...

01:29.229 --> 01:34.907
...and the Pearl Buck Foundation told me that they worked with a lot of Americans who were donating money...

01:34.969 --> 01:36.198
...to help some of these kids.

01:36.679 --> 01:40.523
And a man told me, who ran the Pearl Buck Foundation in Korea,...

01:40.597 --> 01:44.073
...that there was a young girl who was 11 years old, being raised by her grandmother.

01:44.144 --> 01:46.353
And the grandmother had never let any Westerners ever see her.

01:46.718 --> 01:48.791
Every time any Westerners came to the village, she hid the girl.

01:49.361 --> 01:51.201
And of course, I was immediately intrigued.

01:51.581 --> 01:54.755
I saw photographs of her and I thought, "I wanted to go." and...

01:54.832 --> 01:57.096
...the guy just told me, "There's no way. This grandmother won't even"...

01:57.239 --> 01:59.807
..."you know, there's no way she's ever going to let you meet this girl that's she's raising."

02:00.226 --> 02:04.043
I took a translator with me and went to this village found the grandmother, sat down with her.

02:04.423 --> 02:07.701
And to my astonishment, she agreed to let me photograph her granddaughter.

02:08.202 --> 02:13.575
And I was paying for this myself, so I asked the translator if it would be okay if I stayed for the week.

02:13.649 --> 02:14.817
I had a sleeping bag.

02:15.589 --> 02:17.893
The family had a small shed on the side of the house,...

02:18.305 --> 02:21.063
...so I said, "Could I sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings?"

02:21.541 --> 02:28.235
And I just told the little girl, whose name was Hyun Sook Lee, that if I ever did anything to embarrass her,...

02:28.334 --> 02:30.541
...she didn't speak a word of English although she looked very American,...

02:31.196 --> 02:32.575
...she could just put up her hand and say, "Stop."

02:32.735 --> 02:33.939
And I would stop taking pictures.

02:34.306 --> 02:35.353
And then my translator left.

02:35.475 --> 02:37.431
So there I was, I couldn't speak a word of Korean...

02:37.893 --> 02:39.560
...and this is the first night I met Hyun Sook.
