Hi. I'm Abby from Google. Today, I want to show you Google Catalogs.

00:05.063 --> 00:09.027
A fun, new, interactive way to shop all your favorite catalogs on a tablet.

00:10.526 --> 00:12.809
Google Catalogs features the stores and brands you love.

00:13.379 --> 00:16.761
From Williams-Sonoma to Neiman-Marcus, to Sephora and many more.

00:17.700 --> 00:21.054
With Google Catalogs, browsing through a catalog is a rich and engaging experience.

00:21.712 --> 00:24.662
As you browse, you can tap on tags to learn more about products...

00:25.957 --> 00:27.990
...and view inspiring photos and videos.

00:30.167 --> 00:31.875
If you're looking for something specific,...

00:32.165 --> 00:35.238
...Google Catalogs lets you search within or across catalogs.

00:35.615 --> 00:38.944
Google Catalogs also makes it easy to save products that catch your eye...

00:39.055 --> 00:40.353
...by adding them to your favorites.

00:41.693 --> 00:44.469
And when you find an item you like, you can buy it online right away...

00:46.291 --> 00:47.944
...or find it at a nearby store.

00:49.253 --> 00:50.270
If you're feeling creative,...

00:50.592 --> 00:53.662
...you can make a collage from products you saved across different catalogs.

00:54.611 --> 00:57.975
You can choose a background, then arrange and resize pictures and add text.

00:59.009 --> 01:01.413
And when you're done, you can share your collage with a friend...

01:01.735 --> 01:04.543
...or even make it public to other Google Catalogs users.

01:05.007 --> 01:10.060
Bottom line, Google Catalogs makes catalog shopping even more fun and creative.

01:10.561 --> 01:14.142
