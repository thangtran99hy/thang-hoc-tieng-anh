There are new details tonight about the violence that rocked Vancouver this week.

00:04.663 --> 00:07.805
The rioters, the ramifications, the reaction.

00:08.208 --> 00:11.717
But first, the photo that continues to captivate the world.

00:12.203 --> 00:14.191
Romance amid the madness...

00:14.590 --> 00:18.348
...but this already - iconic picture tells only part of the story.

00:18.568 --> 00:21.429
Tonight, the couple in that photo is speaking out.

00:21.770 --> 00:26.669
And the National's Ian Hanomansing got the exclusive Canadian interview. Ian.

00:28.165 --> 00:32.172
Well Heather, so many people have been wondering if this could possibly be real.

00:32.623 --> 00:36.305
Turns out it is and the story behind it is remarkable.

00:37.732 --> 00:41.981
Of all the images of this riot: news footage and cellphone cameras,...

00:42.533 --> 00:45.410
...this has emerged as one of the most memorable pictures.

00:45.813 --> 00:48.249
A tender moment in the midst of chaos.

00:48.864 --> 00:54.157
And this is the couple, Canadian Alexandra Thomas and her Australian boyfriend Scott Jones...

00:54.485 --> 00:58.165
...who heard yesterday morning, a picture of them was all over the internet.

00:58.855 --> 00:59.827
It's like, "Oh my god!"

01:00.154 --> 01:04.107
He was waking me up in the morning saying, "There's a photo of us."

01:04.422 --> 01:07.841
"But we took lots of photos last night. We were with our friends, there were lots of us,..."

01:07.975 --> 01:10.013
"...you know, painting face paint on our faces and stuff."

01:10.437 --> 01:11.533
"What photo do you mean?"

01:14.267 --> 01:15.570
"It was kind of like a big photo."

01:16.357 --> 01:20.837
They've decided to do one Canadian TV interview, describing what happened when they got...

01:20.949 --> 01:24.183
...caught on the street with riot police marching towards them.

01:24.599 --> 01:30.870
I was upset. I fell down and didn't really know exactly what was happening.

01:30.940 --> 01:32.302
I was upset.

01:32.714 --> 01:33.943
And then you were comforted by him.

01:34.191 --> 01:37.706
Yes, so I went back for her and they started banging us with the shields...

01:37.773 --> 01:39.827
..like trying to get us to move. I don't know why; we weren't...

01:40.718 --> 01:42.422
...being aggressive towards them or anything like that.

01:42.581 --> 01:44.366
But then eventually, they passed over us.

01:45.749 --> 01:46.739
And that's when we were on the ground.

01:47.670 --> 01:49.934
She was a bit hysterical afterwards obviously...

01:50.529 --> 01:51.606
...and I was just trying to calm her down.

01:52.016 --> 01:53.131
Here is another view.

01:53.553 --> 01:57.641
An amateur photographer provided these pictures exclusively to the CBC...

01:58.034 --> 02:00.127
...because she wanted people to see what happened.

02:00.683 --> 02:05.639
I think it's something everyone should know that it's like they have not done anything and the...

02:05.749 --> 02:08.859
...police might have might have gone a little bit too far by hurting them.

02:09.986 --> 02:12.528
And it's the truth so I think everyone should know.

02:12.725 --> 02:16.760
First, I think they overreacted like they treated us all like criminals.

02:18.015 --> 02:27.054
In the end I'm safe, I'm not that hurt. And yeah, we're safe and in the city, most people are safe.

02:29.058 --> 02:33.674
All of this has been quite a send-off for the young couple; turns out long before it happened they were...

02:33.968 --> 02:38.619
...planning to move to Australia and they are making that move in a couple of days.
