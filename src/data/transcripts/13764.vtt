I'm Bambi Francisco.

00:01.446 --> 00:05.600
More than one hundred million dollars is spent on the virtual world known as Cyworlds.

00:05.686 --> 00:09.203
Cyworld is one of the most popular social network sites in Korea...

00:09.285 --> 00:12.823
...and joining me to talk about that hot asset in the company's moves into the US...

00:12.905 --> 00:16.002
...is Henry Chon, CEO of Cyworld, USA.

00:16.384 --> 00:19.125
Henry, Cyworld launched in the US recently...

00:19.209 --> 00:21.987
...but let's just talk about Korea because that's where it's really popular.

00:22.349 --> 00:26.867
300 thousand dollars is spent daily on that site just for merchandise.

00:27.122 --> 00:29.168
What are the Cyworld members buying?

00:29.930 --> 00:33.528
Typically, it's a digital assets that we created with graphics people...

00:33.637 --> 00:38.417
...that represents anything between household items or paintings or...

00:38.789 --> 00:42.551
...anything that you can use to decorate your space, that's called mini - room.

00:43.621 --> 00:48.099
There are couches and there are dining tables and anything that you like to sort of say,...

00:48.455 --> 00:50.125
..."This is me in the virtual world,"...

00:51.071 --> 00:52.451
...in a self - explanatory way.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.567
How much is the virtual Picasso go for?

00:55.135 --> 00:59.241
I think, last time I checked it's about a dollar. These items are anywhere between...

00:59.303 --> 01:03.831
...ten cents to a dollar, maybe two, typically on the lower end rather than the high end.

01:03.913 --> 01:05.412
Do you have to pay the copyright fee for that?

01:05.517 --> 01:09.921
We did, yes. We worked with the copyright owners to make sure that their rights were protected.

01:10.045 --> 01:15.085
Now, I can foresee a lot of members becoming virtual designers and creating their own label...

01:15.209 --> 01:15.513
Right.

01:15.622 --> 01:20.536
...and selling their designer label handbags or rugs or home furnishings.

01:20.951 --> 01:22.089
Is that what they can do today?

01:22.754 --> 01:25.844
Not right now, but I think that's where we're going with our services.

01:26.445 --> 01:31.332
So far, we had about 3,000 designers and content providers that are creating anything...

01:31.874 --> 01:36.206
...that we sell. But, you know, there's always a demand by our user and community to say,...

01:36.522 --> 01:40.365
...you know, "I am really good at creating these things. I like to share these with other people."

01:40.704 --> 01:43.888
So we are trying to create a place where we can share those kinds of things.

01:44.356 --> 01:49.280
And the creators of the content are protected in some way by a profit sharing or some kind of revenue sharing.
