00:01.131 --> 00:01.911
What age are you now?

00:02.807 --> 00:03.517
I'm 18 now.

00:03.585 --> 00:04.620
18! You're driving a car?

00:05.227 --> 00:07.951
Yeah, I've just been driving for like five months now, yeah.

00:08.025 --> 00:09.207
Really? Where did you go?

00:14.241 --> 00:14.915
Where did you go?

00:15.009 --> 00:17.216
I mean, do you drive? Do you do road trips and stuff?

00:17.352 --> 00:17.805
Yeah, I do.

00:17.890 --> 00:20.027
I've done a few of them, yeah.

00:22.873 --> 00:24.226
I just got an ice cream van.

00:33.376 --> 00:34.386
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:36.475 --> 00:38.806
You know what? Are these ice cream fans?

00:43.229 --> 00:44.241
Why did you get an ice cream van?

00:44.315 --> 00:46.209
Is that in case the, you know?

00:47.553 --> 00:49.582
When I was younger, I always wanted to be an ice cream man.

00:49.670 --> 00:49.948
Right.

00:51.637 --> 00:53.835
I've always had interest in that sort of career.

00:53.932 --> 00:54.953
So, I don't know.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.814
The ice cream side of show business.

00:56.895 --> 00:57.319
Yeah!

00:59.186 --> 00:59.674
It's really cool.

01:00.235 --> 01:01.191
Do you have ice cream in it?

01:01.288 --> 01:02.221
Do you stock?

01:02.299 --> 01:03.989
Fully stocked, yeah. I've got sweets.

01:05.037 --> 01:09.217
Do you stop, play the tune, stop, and then sell the ice cream to the children?

01:09.548 --> 01:11.116
No I don't sell it, yeah.

01:11.480 --> 01:12.350
You just give it away?

01:12.599 --> 01:14.397
No, no, I don't even serve yet...

01:14.500 --> 01:16.593
...because I think you have to get a license.

01:16.683 --> 01:17.737
It's quite complicated.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.795
So, I just play the tune.

01:20.465 --> 01:23.983
You play the tune and innocent children think, "It's an ice cream man!"

01:24.186 --> 01:25.353
And you drive on by?

01:29.792 --> 01:31.443
Do you realize the effect of this?

01:31.659 --> 01:35.567
The child sees the ice cream man; he hears the thing, "Ice cream man! Ice cream man!",...

01:35.723 --> 01:36.290
...runs out...

01:36.958 --> 01:40.970
...it's the ice cream man! "Ron Weasley is driving the damn ice cream truck!"

01:42.321 --> 01:43.687
And it doesn't stop!

01:45.632 --> 01:49.623
Then the kid goes back and goes, "Mom, mom! I saw Ron Weasley driving an ice cream truck!"

01:50.503 --> 01:52.735
And he gets sent to a child psychiatrist.
