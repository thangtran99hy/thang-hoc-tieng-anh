00:00.011 --> 00:02.789
Did you watch any of the Super Bowl commercials? Did you find them controversial?

00:02.919 --> 00:03.775
No, I was flying over.

00:03.923 --> 00:04.306
Oh.

00:04.416 --> 00:05.268
So, I missed the whole...

00:05.339 --> 00:05.885
From Hawaii?

00:06.116 --> 00:06.768
From Hawaii.

00:06.922 --> 00:07.906
How do you like living there?

00:08.049 --> 00:11.569
Oh! It's beautiful, so nice and warm and none of this cold...

00:11.673 --> 00:13.558
...sting; none of those scarves and the hats.

00:13.715 --> 00:16.243
I don't remember if we asked you this last time but I have to ask you,...

00:16.513 --> 00:19.960
..did you ever think of changing your name to like, Mary Kim or something?

00:20.241 --> 00:23.903
Did you ever think of that 'cause it's hard to remember and say a name that's Asian?

00:23.981 --> 00:29.361
I did, I did. I actually went to the High School for Performing Arts.

00:29.528 --> 00:30.485
Oh! Here in the city?

00:30.723 --> 00:32.130
Did you dance on the cafeteria?

00:32.207 --> 00:33.053
No, I did not.

00:33.706 --> 00:34.769
But you were born in Korea?

00:34.907 --> 00:39.239
I was born in Korea. We came over; my whole family came over when I was ten and my teacher said,...

00:39.319 --> 00:44.233
..."You know what? Just concentrate on being a great actress and people will learn your name."...

00:44.805 --> 00:46.281
...like you guys did. Sort of,...

00:46.526 --> 00:46.745
Yeah.

00:46.917 --> 00:50.937
...because there's like Oprah Winfrey. That's a hard name.

00:51.933 --> 00:53.707
Barack Obama, that's not easy.

00:53.794 --> 00:54.375
Exactly!

00:54.780 --> 00:57.713
Arnold Schwarzenegger; names that were usually would have been changed.

00:57.826 --> 01:00.021
Your sister, who is your younger sister,...

01:00.146 --> 01:01.284
Her name is Holly Kim.

01:01.891 --> 01:03.447
...she's sitting right in front of us.

01:03.534 --> 01:03.715
Hi.

01:04.551 --> 01:05.550
And Holly's gonna have a baby.

01:05.655 --> 01:06.639
Gonna have a baby?

01:06.725 --> 01:09.923
She's gonna have baby; she's seven months pregnant.

01:11.610 --> 01:16.123
Holly is married and having a baby, and your older sister who is in Korea?

01:16.780 --> 01:17.977
She's married; she has a kid,...

01:18.055 --> 01:18.247
And?

01:18.643 --> 01:19.265
...a daughter.

01:19.911 --> 01:20.440
What about you?

01:21.683 --> 01:22.635
Do I sound like your mother?

01:24.996 --> 01:25.877
Well, I love you for it.

01:26.727 --> 01:28.581
You know, it takes time.

01:28.929 --> 01:29.159
Yeah.

01:29.477 --> 01:35.878
I will. I want to and I want to be a mom someday, I just don't know exactly when.

01:36.085 --> 01:38.358
You kind of get to live vicariously through your character...

01:38.476 --> 01:40.681
...'cause your character is pregnant on the show, right?

01:40.817 --> 01:48.600
Yeah, I think I'll start showing my pregnancy, my belly, like in season five or something because...

01:48.995 --> 01:51.681
...on the island days, it's only been 95 days.

01:52.098 --> 01:52.952
Yeah, I believe that.

01:53.525 --> 01:57.155
But I mean, since we've been on the show for three years, people think we've been there for three years.

01:57.481 --> 01:57.816
Not true.

01:57.915 --> 02:00.101
And now with this big break, you guys have 16 new episodes.
