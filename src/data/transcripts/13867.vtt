Apple says its CEO, Steve Jobs, is resigning, effective immediately.

00:10.743 --> 00:13.340
Jobs has now been elected as the company's Chairman.

00:13.730 --> 00:16.262
Tim Cook will take on the role of CEO.

00:16.799 --> 00:20.325
Cook had previously served as the company's Chief Operating Officer.

00:20.958 --> 00:23.775
Jobs wrote a letter to the company's Board of Directors.

00:24.162 --> 00:29.696
In it, he says, "I believe Apple's brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it."

00:30.108 --> 00:34.283
"And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role."

00:35.095 --> 00:37.665
Jobs has battled with health problems in the past.

00:38.135 --> 00:45.115
In 2004, he revealed he had been diagnosed with and cured of a rare form of pancreatic cancer.

00:45.650 --> 00:49.061
In the following years, Jobs took additional leaves for health reasons.

00:49.563 --> 00:52.600
And each time, he emerged looking more and more frail.
