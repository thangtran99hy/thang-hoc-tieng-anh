Holograms are three-dimensional images produced by two distinct beams of light.

00:05.187 --> 00:08.177
But until now, they could only be seen but not touched.

00:08.495 --> 00:13.308
Now, scientists in Japan have changed all that with the creation of touchable holograms.

00:14.026 --> 00:17.521
Researchers at Tokyo University have come up with the technology...

00:17.615 --> 00:19.317
...that is the first and significant step...

00:19.403 --> 00:22.746
...away from the mouse and keyboard: touchable holograms.

00:25.935 --> 00:28.778
Up until now, holography has been for the eyes only...

00:29.271 --> 00:32.047
...and if you try to touch it, your hand will go right through.

00:32.543 --> 00:37.630
But now, we have the technology that also adds the sensation of touch to holograms.

00:39.671 --> 00:43.289
The technology consists of software that uses ultrasonic waves...

00:43.369 --> 00:47.547
...to create pressure on the hand of the user touching the projected hologram.

00:48.099 --> 00:53.303
Researchers are using two Wiimotes from Nintendo's Wii gaming system to track a user's hand.

00:53.889 --> 00:57.996
The technology was used at SIGGRAPH, an annual computer graphics conference,...

00:58.221 --> 01:01.817
...and has so far only been tested with relatively simple objects.

01:02.216 --> 01:06.112
But its inventors have big plans for touchable holograms in the future.

01:08.967 --> 01:11.197
For example, it's been shown that in hospitals...

01:11.524 --> 01:15.853
...there can be contamination between people due to objects that are touched communally.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.838
If you can change the switches and such into a virtual switch,...

01:20.291 --> 01:23.166
...then you no longer have worry about touch contamination.

01:23.870 --> 01:26.276
This is one application that's quite easy to see.

01:27.018 --> 01:30.549
Touchable holograms could be used for a wide variety of things,...

01:30.909 --> 01:34.355
...everything from light switches to books with each appearing when needed...

01:34.509 --> 01:36.229
...and then disappearing when not.

01:36.849 --> 01:41.003
And holograms could replace the need for making new interfaces for technology...

01:41.132 --> 01:45.035
...since they could be changed without having to make a new physical product.
