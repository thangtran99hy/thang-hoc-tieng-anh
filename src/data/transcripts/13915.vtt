Food shopping these days can be stressful but at holiday time, it can be especially rough.

00:12.067 --> 00:15.641
Good Housekeeping has a few tips to keep you stress-free and organized,...

00:15.841 --> 00:18.300
...like bringing your own reusable green bags.

00:18.400 --> 00:21.840
If they become too bulky, place the smaller bags into the larger ones...

00:21.944 --> 00:23.910
...then clip them onto the back of  the carriage.

00:24.163 --> 00:27.541
If you're buying jugs of water or soda, put those in your carriage first...

00:27.637 --> 00:31.874
...so you don't have to rearrange your cart to keep the bottles from crushing fragile purchases.

00:32.098 --> 00:35.452
Another time and money saver, writing your grocery list at home.

00:36.004 --> 00:39.554
The more you're in the store for over 30 minutes, you're more likely to spend more money.

00:39.700 --> 00:43.260
So by making a list and sticking to it, you'll get through the grocery store faster...

00:43.340 --> 00:44.926
...rather than wandering through the aisles.

00:45.309 --> 00:49.217
Standing in line either at the deli counter or checking out is a real time waster.

00:49.494 --> 00:52.705
See if your supermarket allows you to place your deli order over the phone.

00:52.791 --> 00:54.945
Hello, I placed an order about 15 minutes ago?

00:55.044 --> 00:56.615
Is that turkey and a roast beef that you ordered?

00:56.807 --> 00:57.201
Yes.

00:57.369 --> 00:58.047
OK, here you go.

00:58.599 --> 01:00.765
And finally, simplify unpacking at home...

01:00.830 --> 01:04.607
...by asking your grocery clerk at the store to group like items together.

01:04.767 --> 01:07.203
