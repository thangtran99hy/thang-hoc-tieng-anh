Curiosity for me is always about asking the first and the second questions.

00:03.639 --> 00:05.357
What is it and then why is it like that?

00:07.972 --> 00:11.191
People are always amazed when I talk about being an anthropologist at Intel 'cause...

00:11.279 --> 00:13.679
...they can't imagine what that job would possibly entail.

00:15.369 --> 00:17.119
Knowing what people do with technology today...

00:17.597 --> 00:19.888
...can help you make the technology fit tomorrow.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.799
You have to know why people love the things they already have...

00:23.211 --> 00:25.338
...to invent the next generation of things they're gonna want.

00:27.797 --> 00:30.617
I'm always interested in,  "Is there a different way of thinking about an object?"

00:31.588 --> 00:33.905
How do you let people have a moment of seeing something...

00:34.181 --> 00:36.189
...deeply familiar from a really different perspective?

00:38.105 --> 00:43.377
How do you create the moment when someone can see something for the first time?

00:44.408 --> 00:46.553
And curiosity is about what you can make people...

00:47.565 --> 00:49.997
...think about, you know, what you can make possible for them.

00:50.876 --> 00:55.546
I think curiosity is not just about observing things, it's about being changed by them.
