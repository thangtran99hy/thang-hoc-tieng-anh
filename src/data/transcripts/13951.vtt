Julian, welcome.

00:15.918 --> 00:23.454
It's been reported that WikiLeaks, your baby, has in the last few years has released more classified documents...

00:23.569 --> 00:25.868
...than the rest of the world's media combined.

00:26.114 --> 00:27.501
Can that possibly be true?

00:28.084 --> 00:29.881
Yeah, can it possibly be true?

00:29.961 --> 00:31.091
It's a worry, isn't it?

00:31.398 --> 00:34.536
That the rest of the world's media is doing such a bad job...

00:35.075 --> 00:40.386
...that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information...

00:40.815 --> 00:42.203
...than the rest of the world press combined.

00:43.189 --> 00:43.993
How does it work?

00:45.770 --> 00:47.545
How do people release the documents?

00:47.635 --> 00:50.038
And how do you secure their privacy?

00:51.349 --> 00:54.867
So these are, as far as we can tell, classical whistleblowers.

00:55.196 --> 00:58.343
And we have a number of ways for them to get information to us.

00:58.838 --> 01:02.913
So we use just state-of-the-art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet, to hide trails,...

01:03.313 --> 01:11.073
...pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections.

01:12.164 --> 01:18.162
We get information in the mail, the regular postal mail, encrypted or not,...

01:18.933 --> 01:21.211
...vet it like a regular news organization,...

01:21.759 --> 01:25.168
...format it which is sometimes something that's quite hard to do,...

01:25.251 --> 01:28.380
...when you're talking about giant databases of information,...

01:29.170 --> 01:35.533
...release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks.

01:36.381 --> 01:39.728
So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate...

01:40.059 --> 01:45.077
...but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is.

01:45.324 --> 01:46.127
That's right, yeah.

01:46.527 --> 01:48.387
Very rarely do we ever know.

01:48.521 --> 01:53.777
And if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible.

01:54.753 --> 01:55.377
God damn it.
