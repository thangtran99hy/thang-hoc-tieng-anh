00:00.011 --> 00:02.747
Have you had information from inside BP?

00:03.733 --> 00:06.521
Yeah, we have a lot but at the moment,...

00:06.643 --> 00:09.481
...we are undergoing a serious fundraising and engineering effort.

00:09.629 --> 00:15.721
So, our publication rate over the past few months has been minimized...

00:15.830 --> 00:21.683
...while we're re-engineering our backup systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have.

00:22.499 --> 00:23.193
That's a problem.

00:23.401 --> 00:27.076
I mean, like any sort of growing start-up organization,...

00:27.653 --> 00:30.817
...we are overwhelmed by our growth.

00:31.355 --> 00:36.649
And that means we're getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber...

00:37.285 --> 00:41.002
...but don't have enough people to actually process and vet this information.

00:41.327 --> 00:42.743
So, that's the key bottleneck?

00:42.884 --> 00:47.878
Basically journalistic volunteers and/or the funding of journalistic salaries?

00:48.155 --> 00:50.177
Yup, and trusted people.

00:50.359 --> 00:53.075
I mean, we're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly...

00:54.079 --> 00:56.349
...because of the sort of material we deal with.

00:56.434 --> 01:03.299
So, we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff...

01:03.395 --> 01:06.135
...and then lower security cases.
