00:01.446 --> 00:04.731
I want to tell you about my daughter, Michelle.

00:05.874 --> 00:07.055
She's my baby.

00:13.605 --> 00:17.565
Michelle was born on January 17th, 1964.

00:18.214 --> 00:20.465
That's her brother, Craig, on the left.

00:21.007 --> 00:24.243
We lived in an apartment on the South Side of Chicago,...

00:24.617 --> 00:27.682
...where her father worked at the city water plant...

00:28.005 --> 00:30.071
...and I got to stay home with my children.

00:30.605 --> 00:33.320
Michelle was especially close to her daddy.

00:34.119 --> 00:39.129
My father was in his 50s and my sister would still sit on his lap,...

00:39.730 --> 00:43.807
...and put her head on his shoulder as she used to do when she was a kid.

00:44.732 --> 00:49.767
And that sort of, in one picture, epitomizes their relationship.

00:50.695 --> 00:55.242
Her dad was just a sweet man and a kindhearted man,...

00:55.341 --> 00:59.749
...and somebody who thought everybody should be treated with dignity and respect.

00:59.868 --> 01:01.754
And I think that it carried over to Michelle.

01:02.927 --> 01:05.427
We raised Craig and Michelle to go to college,...

01:06.029 --> 01:09.539
...but we teased them about how some people went away to college,...

01:09.632 --> 01:11.756
...and never came back to their community.

01:12.291 --> 01:16.223
My mom and dad would always say that, "If just a few people would come back..."

01:16.361 --> 01:19.113
"...and live in the community, it would make all the difference in the world."

01:19.221 --> 01:20.897
And we talked about that a lot.

01:21.501 --> 01:23.817
She was very committed to the South Side of Chicago.

01:24.151 --> 01:28.575
She was very committed to using every bit of her skills and her talents to lift others up.

01:29.460 --> 01:31.799
After law school, Michelle came back.

01:32.547 --> 01:34.769
And at first, she worked for a big law firm,...

01:35.445 --> 01:37.329
...that was where she met Barack.

01:37.779 --> 01:42.813
The firm was abuzz about this hotshot first - year law student from Harvard.

01:43.510 --> 01:47.720
His name was Barack Obama. And I thought, "Well, who names their kid Barack Obama?"

01:47.860 --> 01:50.025
So I figured, "This guy has to be weird."

01:50.462 --> 01:53.123
She was assigned as my summer adviser.

01:54.045 --> 01:55.241
I was late that day.

01:55.826 --> 01:58.971
I don't think I made such a great impression, but she was dazzling.

01:59.209 --> 02:01.671
When he first showed up, he was a little late.

02:02.301 --> 02:04.502
So I thought, "Well, maybe he didn't have his act together."

02:05.167 --> 02:09.547
But then when he walked in, he was very handsome and he had this air of "interesting"...

02:09.667 --> 02:11.273
...in him that I didn't expect.

02:11.620 --> 02:12.749
I didn't see a ring on her hand.

02:13.738 --> 02:16.014
So, it turned out she didn't have a boyfriend,...

02:16.177 --> 02:20.785
...but she was very resistant to the idea of some inner office dating.

02:21.835 --> 02:25.427
I asked her a couple of times and she was sort of pushing me off a little bit.

02:25.878 --> 02:27.516
And then he made his big move.

02:27.879 --> 02:30.045
Finally, there was a company picnic.

02:30.263 --> 02:34.198
And on the drive back, I offered to buy her ice cream.

02:34.722 --> 02:37.023
That was what put her over the top.

02:37.166 --> 02:41.062
That's where she said, "You know, this guy knows how to treat a woman."
