If you get butterflies every time you see that special someone,...

00:09.726 --> 00:11.396
...learn how to tell them how you feel.

00:12.177 --> 00:16.618
You will need : forethought, inner strength and courage.

00:17.524 --> 00:19.957
Step one : Assess your time together.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.218
Every relationship evolves differently...

00:22.367 --> 00:25.489
...but it's best to wait at least two months before saying the "L" word.

00:26.167 --> 00:30.363
Step two : Think ahead to plan something special such as a night out,...

00:30.635 --> 00:34.489
...dinner at home or ice cream in the park and seize the moment when it feels right.

00:34.859 --> 00:35.681
But don't force it.

00:36.359 --> 00:38.819
Step three : Rely on your inner strength...

00:38.942 --> 00:41.713
...and work up the courage to let the other person know how you feel...

00:42.019 --> 00:44.928
...and be prepared to hear that they might not feel the same way.

00:45.874 --> 00:49.767
Step four : Give the other person time to adjust and think about it...

00:50.029 --> 00:52.615
...and tell them directly to not answer until they are ready.

00:53.299 --> 00:56.015
Be prepared to wait hours or even days for an answer.

00:56.312 --> 00:57.639
Don't rush the other person.

00:58.425 --> 01:04.171
Step five : Beware of using either e-mail or text messages to say "I love you" for the first time.

01:04.513 --> 01:06.974
While they may feel safer, they are too impersonal.

01:08.121 --> 01:11.760
Step six : Be creative when it comes to saying "I love you."

01:12.115 --> 01:17.522
Signs, notes, and other nonverbal cues can work wonderfully if you keep them personal and genuine.

01:18.289 --> 01:18.797
Did you know?

01:19.448 --> 01:22.135
One of the oldest Valentine's Day cards written in English...

01:22.237 --> 01:25.663
...dates back to 1477, over 500 years ago.
