Ladies and gentlemen,...

00:04.161 --> 00:13.314
...I'm not sure whether this is appropriate in this very solemn ceremony to say a few words of my personal reflection.

00:14.614 --> 00:19.778
People say that good things come to those who wait.

00:20.497 --> 00:22.137
And I know that is true.

00:22.971 --> 00:24.065
And I will tell you why.

00:25.939 --> 00:31.115
Almost 40 years ago, when President Nixon of the United States...

00:31.695 --> 00:36.091
...had established a diplomatic relationship with the People's Republic of China.

00:36.697 --> 00:39.637
There was a high expectation in the United States...

00:40.062 --> 00:46.185
...about how to improve their relationship with the People's Republic of China...

00:46.788 --> 00:53.609
...and they might have wanted to have some perspectives of an Asian person.

00:56.024 --> 01:00.705
I was a young, very junior foreign ministry official at that time,...

01:01.976 --> 01:07.354
...and I learned that one of the most prestigious universities in the United States...

01:08.703 --> 01:16.066
...was sponsoring a full-ride scholarship for a student from my part of the world for Chinese studies.

01:17.031 --> 01:18.804
It was the University of Washington.

01:19.723 --> 01:21.517
And I leapt at the chance.

01:22.044 --> 01:26.375
So, I studied and worked hard, and I took extra exams,...

01:26.725 --> 01:28.651
...and I put everything into it.

01:30.243 --> 01:32.494
And one day, a letter arrived.

01:32.754 --> 01:34.573
I was selected for an interview.

01:35.054 --> 01:36.208
I was so excited.

01:37.162 --> 01:42.019
And I was invited to come to a certain place called the Royal Hotel in Seoul.

01:44.633 --> 01:47.681
I was sure that I would get that.

01:48.880 --> 01:51.259
When I went to the Royal Hotel,...

01:51.836 --> 01:57.359
...I was surprised to find just a dozen of Korean citizens,...
