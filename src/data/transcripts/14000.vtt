So ladies and gentlemen, at TED we talk a lot about leadership and how to make a movement.

00:06.782 --> 00:10.105
So let's watch a movement happen, from start to finish, in under three minutes...

00:10.224 --> 00:11.619
...and dissect some lessons from it.

00:12.279 --> 00:16.857
First of course you know, a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed.

00:18.908 --> 00:20.719
But what he's doing is so easy to follow.

00:20.830 --> 00:22.865
So, here's his first follower with a crucial role.

00:23.037 --> 00:25.005
He's going to show everyone else how to follow.

00:25.536 --> 00:27.779
Now, notice that the leader embraces him as an equal.

00:28.044 --> 00:31.373
So, now it's not about the leader anymore; it's about them, plural.

00:31.739 --> 00:33.459
Now, there he is calling to his friends.

00:33.889 --> 00:38.927
Now, if you notice that the first follower is actually an underestimated form of leadership in itself.

00:39.308 --> 00:41.017
It takes guts to stand out like that.

00:41.811 --> 00:46.098
The first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader.

00:51.704 --> 00:53.168
And here comes a second follower.

00:53.536 --> 00:58.134
Now it's not a lone nut, it's not two nuts; three is a crowd and a crowd is news.

00:58.425 --> 01:00.312
So, a movement must be public.

01:00.731 --> 01:03.786
It's important to show not just the leader, but the followers...

01:03.966 --> 01:07.641
...because you find that new followers emulate the followers, not the leader.

01:08.331 --> 01:11.787
Now, here come two more people and immediately after, three more people.

01:12.034 --> 01:13.261
Now, we've got momentum.

01:13.388 --> 01:14.549
This is the tipping point.

01:14.620 --> 01:16.135
Now, we've got a movement.

01:17.957 --> 01:21.636
So notice that as more people join in, it's less risky.

01:21.842 --> 01:25.263
So, those that were sitting on the fence before now have no reason not to.

01:25.747 --> 01:26.875
They won't stand out,...

01:27.607 --> 01:28.877
...they won't be ridiculed...

01:29.108 --> 01:31.437
...but they will be part of the in-crowd if they hurry.

01:31.968 --> 01:38.630
So over the next minute, you'll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd...

01:38.713 --> 01:41.732
...because eventually they would be ridiculed for not joining in...

01:42.252 --> 01:43.799
...and that's how you make a movement.

01:44.246 --> 01:46.265
But let's recap some lessons from this.

01:46.923 --> 01:52.145
So first, if you are the type like the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone,...

01:52.301 --> 01:55.899
...remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals...

01:56.265 --> 01:58.541
...so it's clearly about the movement, not you.

02:00.023 --> 02:02.495
Okay, but we might have missed the real lesson here.

02:02.577 --> 02:05.237
The biggest lesson if you noticed, did you catch it?

02:05.826 --> 02:08.167
Is that leadership is over - glorified...

02:09.048 --> 02:12.193
...that yes, it was the shirtless guy was first and he'll get all the credit.

02:12.569 --> 02:17.251
But it was really the first follower that transformed the lone nut into a leader.

02:17.785 --> 02:21.205
So, as we're told that we should all be leaders, that would be really ineffective.

02:21.825 --> 02:23.697
If you really care about starting a movement,...

02:24.099 --> 02:27.137
...have the courage to follow and show others how to follow.

02:27.493 --> 02:29.742
And when you find a lone nut doing something great,...

02:30.052 --> 02:33.195
...have the guts to be the first one to stand up and join in.

02:33.509 --> 02:35.726
And what a perfect place to do that, at TED.
