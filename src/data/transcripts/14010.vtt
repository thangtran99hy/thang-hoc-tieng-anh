00:00.393 --> 00:03.864
Wikipedia, on the other hand, begins with a very radical idea...

00:04.583 --> 00:08.155
...and that's for all of us to imagine a world in which every single person on the planet...

00:08.672 --> 00:11.171
...is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge.

00:11.245 --> 00:12.157
And that's what we're doing.

00:13.447 --> 00:16.230
So Wikipedia ; you just saw the little demonstration of it.

00:17.134 --> 00:19.027
It's a freely licensed encyclopedia.

00:19.163 --> 00:22.612
It's written by thousands of volunteers all over the world in many, many languages.

00:23.771 --> 00:27.250
It's written using Wiki software which is the type of software he just demonstrated...

00:27.333 --> 00:31.207
...so anyone can quickly edit and save and it goes live on the Internet immediately.

00:32.998 --> 00:37.557
And everything about Wikipedia is managed by virtually an all - volunteer staff.

00:37.633 --> 00:42.119
So, when Yochai is talking about new methods of organization,...

00:42.206 --> 00:44.140
...he's exactly describing Wikipedia.

00:44.621 --> 00:49.268
And what I'm gonna do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside.

00:50.349 --> 00:54.300
So Wikipedia's owned by the Wikimedia Foundation, which I founded,...

00:54.561 --> 00:56.002
...a nonprofit organization.

00:56.169 --> 00:59.755
And our goal, the core aim of the Wikimedia Foundation,...

01:00.235 --> 01:03.127
...is to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet.

01:03.206 --> 01:04.895
And so if you think about what that means,...

01:05.213 --> 01:07.515
...it means a lot more than just building a cool website.

01:07.785 --> 01:11.927
We're really interested in all the issues of the digital divide, poverty worldwide;...

01:12.682 --> 01:17.023
...empowering people everywhere to have the information that they need to make good decisions.

01:17.093 --> 01:21.370
And so we're gonna have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the Internet.

01:21.440 --> 01:24.295
And so that's a big part of why we've chosen the free licensing model...

01:24.686 --> 01:27.633
...because that empowers local entrepreneurs or anyone who wants to...

01:27.993 --> 01:29.917
...can take our content and do anything they like with it.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.333
You can copy it, redistribute it and you can do it commercially or non - commercially.

01:34.413 --> 01:36.697
So, there's a lot of opportunities that are going to arise...

01:36.873 --> 01:39.671
...around Wikipedia all over the world.

01:40.905 --> 01:42.585
We're funded by donations from the public...

01:42.774 --> 01:48.733
...and one of the more interesting things about that is how little money it actually takes to run Wikipedia.

01:49.197 --> 01:53.267
So, Yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was.

01:53.764 --> 01:57.163
And I'm gonna tell you what the cost of Wikipedia is,...

01:57.239 --> 01:58.838
...but first I'll show you how big it is.

01:58.829 --> 02:02.891
So, we've got over 600,000 articles in English.

02:03.433 --> 02:07.551
We've got two million total articles across many, many different languages.

02:07.907 --> 02:10.318
The biggest languages are German, Japanese, French.

02:11.207 --> 02:13.569
All the Western European languages are quite big.

02:14.916 --> 02:19.829
But only around one-third of all of our traffic to our web clusters to the English Wikipedia,...

02:19.953 --> 02:21.360
...which is surprising to a lot of people.

02:21.421 --> 02:24.740
A lot of people think in a very English - centric way on the Internet,...

02:25.224 --> 02:27.046
...but for us, we're truly global.

02:27.133 --> 02:28.217
We're in many, many languages.

02:29.280 --> 02:34.383
How popular we've gotten to be: we're a top 50 website and we're more popular than the New York Times.

02:34.449 --> 02:38.796
So, this is where we get to Yochai's discussion.

02:39.367 --> 02:42.599
This shows the growth of Wikipedia, we're the blue line there...

02:42.673 --> 02:44.705
...and then this is the New York Times over there.

02:45.430 --> 02:48.652
And what's interesting about this is the New York Times website...

02:48.742 --> 02:50.869
...is a huge, enormous corporate operation...

02:51.135 --> 02:53.459
...with, I have no idea how many, hundreds of employees.

02:54.051 --> 02:58.265
We have exactly one employee and that employee is our lead software developer.

02:58.565 --> 03:03.083
And he's only been our employee since January 2005, all the other growth before that.

03:03.615 --> 03:07.199
So, the servers are managed by a ragtag band of volunteers,...

03:07.289 --> 03:08.964
...all the editing is done by volunteers.

03:09.295 --> 03:13.160
And the way that we're organized is not like any traditional organization you can imagine.

03:13.254 --> 03:16.913
People are always asking, "Well, who's in charge of this?" or "Who does that?"

03:17.261 --> 03:19.435
And the answer is, anybody who wants to pitch in.

03:19.527 --> 03:23.141
It's a very unusual and chaotic thing.
