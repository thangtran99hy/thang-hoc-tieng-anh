Hi! I'm Peter, a Product Manager at Google.

00:06.573 --> 00:09.848
Today, I'm gonna tell you a little bit about SafeSearch for Google images.

00:10.398 --> 00:15.409
SafeSearch is a feature which filters adult content from your web, images, and video results.

00:16.279 --> 00:17.882
By default, it's set to "moderate".

00:18.524 --> 00:20.495
But you can change this in the Search Settings menu...

00:20.653 --> 00:22.270
...on any image search results page.

00:24.659 --> 00:28.977
You'll find the three SafeSearch options in a drop-down menu to the right of the search box.

00:30.495 --> 00:32.771
You can turn SafeSearch off to remove filtering...

00:33.391 --> 00:35.847
...or set it to "strict" for a stronger set of filters.

00:36.505 --> 00:38.489
No filter is 100% perfect, however.

00:38.878 --> 00:42.962
So if you do happen to see an adult image while using a SafeSearch set to "strict" or "moderate",...

00:43.353 --> 00:44.861
...we encourage you to report this to us.

00:46.009 --> 00:50.617
To do this, click the "report offensive images" link in the SafeSearch drop-down menu,...

00:51.578 --> 00:54.740
...then click the "report" button over the image you wish to report.

00:56.024 --> 00:57.983
While we can't take action on all of the reports,...

00:58.169 --> 01:00.681
...they help us improve our SafeSearch algorithm over time,...

01:00.981 --> 01:03.057
...and create a better Images experience for everyone.

01:04.592 --> 01:06.928
