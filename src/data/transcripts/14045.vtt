Dyslexia: so what is it all about?

00:03.762 --> 00:09.033
Well, dyslexia is a word that is used to describe a difficulty with written language,...

00:09.571 --> 00:12.284
...organization, and short-term memory.

00:12.943 --> 00:15.887
However, no one's dyslexia is the same.

00:16.295 --> 00:18.175
Dyslexia is like a thumbprint,...

00:18.679 --> 00:20.546
...every print being different.

00:21.640 --> 00:24.622
Dyslexia is a difference in how the brain works.

00:25.367 --> 00:27.514
This can have positive effects also.

00:28.650 --> 00:31.541
Often, dyslexics are good at practical tasks,...

00:32.113 --> 00:35.539
...whilst many are good communicators or problem solvers.

00:36.581 --> 00:41.117
It is estimated that about ten percent of the population are dyslexic.

00:41.631 --> 00:44.557
But being dyslexic does not affect intelligence.

00:44.966 --> 00:49.113
In fact, there are many successful dyslexics in all walks of life.

00:49.498 --> 00:52.230
Everybody finds certain things easier than others.

00:52.671 --> 00:54.116
And we all have a talent.

00:54.774 --> 00:58.313
It's just a case of finding what your particular talent is.

00:59.089 --> 01:03.352
Most dyslexics find a word-based society extremely challenging.

01:04.032 --> 01:07.743
Self-confidence can be dented if they constantly fail at school.

01:08.975 --> 01:12.847
Dyslexics need to be taught in a way that matches the way they learn.

01:13.639 --> 01:16.969
Low self-esteem often holds dyslexics back in life.

01:17.648 --> 01:24.501
Difficulties with literacy or organizing yourself can cause problems at work, school or college.

01:25.311 --> 01:29.301
It is important that a dyslexic gets the right support when it's needed...

01:29.820 --> 01:32.100
...and plays to their strengths whenever possible.

01:32.879 --> 01:38.429
Relationships with friends and family can be stressful if other people don't understand.

01:39.217 --> 01:44.447
It really does help to talk so you can all understand how everybody is feeling.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.831
Being dyslexic is for life.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.580
There is no quick fix.

01:50.215 --> 01:55.589
But with determination and support, happiness and success will come.
