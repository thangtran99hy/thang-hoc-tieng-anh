00:02.829 --> 00:03.655
Winter is coming.

00:04.645 --> 00:08.826
This one will be long and the dark things will come with it.

00:09.265 --> 00:10.047
I saw what I saw.

00:10.974 --> 00:11.861
I know they did it.

00:12.329 --> 00:13.713
In my bones, I know it.

00:13.828 --> 00:16.740
The boy won't talk and if he does, I'll kill him.

00:17.453 --> 00:18.669
I don't want to be his queen.

00:19.581 --> 00:20.389
I want to go home.

00:21.477 --> 00:23.613
My brother has his sword and I have my mind.

00:24.180 --> 00:27.069
You might not have my name but you have my blood.

00:27.967 --> 00:31.420
Honor! You think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear!

00:31.482 --> 00:33.689
Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done.

00:34.263 --> 00:36.244
Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.442
You kill me, your brother is a dead man.

00:39.691 --> 00:42.703
Stop this madness in the name of your king!

00:44.259 --> 00:50.317
I'll kill the whole bloody lot of them until you and I are the only people left in this world.
