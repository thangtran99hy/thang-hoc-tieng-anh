Hello. Welcome to Michael's Better Business English.

00:03.827 --> 00:07.038
This month, we're looking at how to be an active listener.

00:08.089 --> 00:10.645
Now, this is very important for Japanese business people.

00:11.299 --> 00:15.885
Often, Japanese people, when listening, go into "silent mode".

00:16.318 --> 00:18.427
Saying nothing, no reaction.

00:19.026 --> 00:21.059
It is very difficult to have a conversation with them.

00:22.016 --> 00:25.842
Instead, you should be using these active listening techniques.

00:26.365 --> 00:27.988
Three - kick techniques.

00:28.355 --> 00:30.834
First, show interest.

00:31.698 --> 00:35.305
This is by using expressions like, "really", "interesting".

00:36.048 --> 00:37.945
This encourages the speaker...

00:38.261 --> 00:39.238
...and supports them.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.531
Makes it easier for them to keep speaking.

00:42.700 --> 00:44.981
Second, check understanding.

00:45.742 --> 00:48.064
If you are not sure, say something.

00:48.847 --> 00:53.228
"So, what do you mean by...", "Sorry, I didn't understand this."

00:54.063 --> 00:58.904
By being active and checking understanding, you can ensure effective conversation.

00:59.883 --> 01:02.261
And third, develop the conversation.

01:03.345 --> 01:08.871
"Develop the conversation" means extend or expand the conversation into other areas.

01:09.365 --> 01:12.905
For example, "Oh, your trip to Germany sounds interesting."

01:13.283 --> 01:15.687
"Have you been to other European countries?..."

01:16.533 --> 01:18.717
...or, "That project sounds very exciting,..."

01:18.935 --> 01:20.723
"...can you tell me more about it?"

01:21.228 --> 01:25.225
So, this is expanding and extending the conversation further.

01:26.476 --> 01:29.766
Finally, remember the image of tennis.

01:30.664 --> 01:35.079
Good listener in a conversation is like playing a game of tennis.

01:35.399 --> 01:38.236
They're helping to keep the ball in the air.

01:38.991 --> 01:41.585
By being an active listener, you can do this.

01:42.424 --> 01:43.806
Thank you and good luck!
