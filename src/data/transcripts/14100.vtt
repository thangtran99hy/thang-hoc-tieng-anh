00:00.373 --> 00:00.788
What do you mean?

00:03.773 --> 00:06.131
It's decided: my life.

00:06.275 --> 00:07.585
Decided: my job.

00:09.887 --> 00:14.589
I can see whole other people so excited and happy to be there.

00:15.820 --> 00:16.417
You're not afraid?

00:17.381 --> 00:19.099
Sometimes, I feel so afraid.

00:19.299 --> 00:26.855
That is, I can at some parts protect myself and protect my security guard and translator,...

00:27.291 --> 00:29.135
...supporting me for my work.

00:29.585 --> 00:34.691
And then I depend on, actually my guide.

00:35.391 --> 00:37.440
I depend on the guide for my work.

00:37.869 --> 00:44.203
And then, it's good.

00:50.198 --> 00:51.918
Some parts are notorious.

00:52.036 --> 00:54.519
Some parts have a reputation so it's good.

00:57.153 --> 01:01.238
But it's, I love, I like; no, I love!

01:02.227 --> 01:02.977
Being a war photographer?

01:03.593 --> 01:04.174
My job.

01:05.286 --> 01:09.289
I love the corps and war people.

01:09.627 --> 01:11.561
But I don't like the war.

01:12.021 --> 01:14.144
I believe please stop the war,...

01:14.330 --> 01:15.315
...anywhere in the world.

01:15.989 --> 01:21.959
My dream is that my job in the future is to be a school photographer.

01:22.195 --> 01:23.147
A school photographer?

01:23.233 --> 01:25.479
That's right. That is in my dream for the future.

01:26.274 --> 01:29.957
You know the war place will be finished for the whole of the world, that scene.

01:30.663 --> 01:36.517
And then nobody will need a photographer as a war photographer.

01:37.175 --> 01:42.485
But and then next, I wanna be a school photographer.

01:42.777 --> 01:43.685
That is my dream.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.098
Wow, that's a great dream.

01:46.269 --> 01:49.608
So, if there is no more war, that would be the perfect way to spend your life.

01:49.982 --> 01:50.505
That's right.
