00:00.011 --> 00:00.767
Why her?

00:00.993 --> 00:01.630
Why Miki?

00:02.063 --> 00:04.343
Why did you choose her?

00:04.463 --> 00:08.669
Well Miki; because first of all I've worked once with Miki.

00:09.277 --> 00:10.680
In "Silk", right?

00:10.813 --> 00:14.517
"Silk" and then immediately...

00:15.421 --> 00:16.128
You fell in love?

00:16.294 --> 00:22.159
...fell in love; I found the charm of Miki as a fabulous actress.

00:22.239 --> 00:29.588
And she, Miki, brings way more than her beauty to the part...

00:29.673 --> 00:35.691
...like she has, I feel, an aura when she walks in the room.

00:35.909 --> 00:38.483
She has soul, a deep soul...

00:38.603 --> 00:38.851
Right.

00:39.025 --> 00:43.747
...and I was looking for another opportunity to work with her.

00:43.829 --> 00:48.814
And so I'm writing a script now where she has a part in that.

00:50.566 --> 00:59.122
So, I mean it's circumstantial.

00:59.242 --> 01:07.154
But also, if we take the idea that one actress would play these three women,...

01:08.542 --> 01:13.280
...it's hard to think of or find a better choice than Miki.

01:13.361 --> 01:18.527
She has the youth, beautiful youth...

01:18.905 --> 01:26.789
...and maturity; you can see her going a Western style, her eyes meet the lead.

01:26.890 --> 01:35.019
But also, she's a well - educated in traditional kimono dance and tea ceremonies...

01:35.357 --> 01:41.987
...so she also carries a very traditional Japanese culture.

01:42.077 --> 01:45.605
So in my mind, I think she's just perfect.
