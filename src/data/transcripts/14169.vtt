Imagine if you could record your life, everything you said, everything you did,...

00:22.411 --> 00:25.297
...available in a perfect memory store at your fingertips,...

00:25.793 --> 00:29.566
So, you could go back and find memorable moments and relive them,...

00:30.373 --> 00:35.084
...or sift through traces of time and discover patterns in your own life....

00:35.587 --> 00:37.681
...that previously had gone undiscovered.

00:38.519 --> 00:44.077
That's exactly the journey that my family began five and a half years ago.

00:44.519 --> 00:47.131
This is my wife and collaborator, Rupal.

00:47.672 --> 00:51.512
And on this day, at this moment, we walked into the house with our first child,...

00:51.674 --> 00:53.517
...our beautiful baby boy.

00:54.118 --> 01:00.240
And we walked into a house with a very special home video recording system.

01:07.396 --> 01:07.985
Okay.

01:10.557 --> 01:14.629
This moment and thousands of other moments special for us...

01:14.983 --> 01:18.223
...were captured in our home because in every room in the house,...

01:18.460 --> 01:21.243
...if you looked up, you'd see a camera and a microphone,...

01:21.761 --> 01:25.711
...and if you looked down, you'd get this bird's-eye view of the room.

01:25.955 --> 01:34.744
Here's our living room, the baby bedroom, kitchen, dining room and the rest of the house.

01:35.414 --> 01:41.198
And all of these fed into a disc array that was designed for a continuous capture.

01:41.319 --> 01:44.749
So here, we are flying through a day in our home,...

01:45.270 --> 01:49.292
...as we move from sunlit morning through incandescent evening...

01:50.190 --> 01:52.851
...and finally, lights-out for the day.

01:53.921 --> 01:58.387
Over the course of three years, we recorded eight to ten hours a day,...

01:59.102 --> 02:03.749
...amassing roughly a quarter million hours of multi - track audio and video.

02:04.263 --> 02:09.052
So, you're looking at a piece of what is by far the largest home video collection ever made.

02:11.960 --> 02:16.739
And what this data represents for our family at a personal level,...

02:17.497 --> 02:22.228
...the impact has already been immense, and we're still learning its value.

02:22.670 --> 02:27.537
Countless moments of unsolicited, natural moments, not posed moments,...

02:27.923 --> 02:31.672
...are captured there, and we're starting to learn how to discover them and find them.

02:33.055 --> 02:35.974
But there's also a scientific reason that drove this project,...

02:36.158 --> 02:40.834
...which was to use this kind of natural longitudinal data to understand....

02:41.173 --> 02:45.091
...the process of how a child learns language. That child being my son.

02:45.550 --> 02:50.361
And so, with many privacy provisions put in place to protect...

02:50.773 --> 02:52.479
...everyone who was recorded in the data,...

02:53.027 --> 02:55.840
...we made elements of the data available to...

02:56.272 --> 03:01.571
...my trusted research team at MIT, so we could start teasing apart patterns...

03:02.021 --> 03:04.995
...in this massive data set, trying to understand...

03:05.679 --> 03:09.177
...the influence of social environments on language acquisition.
