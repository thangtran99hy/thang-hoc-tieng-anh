00:05.451 --> 00:07.917
In just two weeks, we'll come together, as a nation,...

00:08.153 --> 00:11.230
...to mark the 10th anniversary of the September 11th attacks.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.887
We'll remember the innocent lives we lost.

00:14.830 --> 00:16.921
We'll stand with the families who loved them.

00:17.994 --> 00:22.427
We'll honor the heroic first responders who rushed to the scene and saved so many.

00:23.421 --> 00:26.474
And we'll pay tribute to our troops and military families,...

00:26.867 --> 00:29.548
...and all those who have served over the past ten years,...

00:29.965 --> 00:31.686
...to keep us safe and strong.

00:33.252 --> 00:36.665
We'll also recall how the worst terrorist attack in American history...

00:37.055 --> 00:38.939
...brought out the best in the American people.

00:39.939 --> 00:41.485
How Americans lined up to give blood.

00:42.309 --> 00:45.150
How volunteers drove across the country to lend a hand.

00:46.099 --> 00:48.170
How school children donated their savings.

00:49.164 --> 00:54.020
How communities, faith groups and businesses collected food and clothing.

00:55.467 --> 00:56.431
We were united.

00:56.525 --> 01:01.101
And the outpouring of generosity and compassion reminded us that in times of challenge,...

01:01.507 --> 01:04.655
...we Americans move forward together, as one people.

01:05.475 --> 01:09.546
This September 11th, Michelle and I will join the commemorations at Ground Zero,...

01:09.954 --> 01:11.978
...in Shanksville and at the Pentagon.

01:12.893 --> 01:15.634
But even if you can't be in New York, Pennsylvania or Virginia,...

01:16.288 --> 01:18.689
...every American can be part of this anniversary.

01:19.798 --> 01:24.106
Once again, 9/11 will be a National Day of Service and Remembrance.

01:24.795 --> 01:27.575
And in the days and weeks ahead, folks across the country...

01:27.719 --> 01:31.530
...in all 50 states will come together in their communities and neighborhoods...

01:31.945 --> 01:35.912
...to honor the victims of 9/11 and to reaffirm the strength of our nation...

01:36.255 --> 01:37.955
...with acts of service and charity.

01:39.009 --> 01:40.873
As we saw after 9/11, the strength...

01:41.002 --> 01:43.991
...of America has always been the character and compassion of our people.

01:44.751 --> 01:49.295
So, as we mark this solemn anniversary, let's summon that spirit once more.

01:50.277 --> 01:54.503
And let's show that the sense of common purpose that we need in America...

01:55.087 --> 01:56.357
...doesn't have to be a fleeting moment.

01:57.328 --> 02:01.802
It can be a lasting virtue not just on one day, but every day.
