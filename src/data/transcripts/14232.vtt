Essential information from Fine Living.

00:03.019 --> 00:07.211
One of the things you could do for Grandparents Day is to go through old photo albums.

00:07.333 --> 00:11.802
While doing this, the family stories come up and the oral histories that are shared,...

00:11.935 --> 00:15.294
...which is really important, especially for a child, to get that feeling...

00:15.396 --> 00:18.493
...of their family history and their place in the family.

00:18.661 --> 00:22.249
Younger children, they just love the whole idea of family trees.

00:22.351 --> 00:27.057
They can actually draw a tree and place different members of the family on the family tree.

00:27.147 --> 00:30.279
And they can also have dinner for their grandparents.

00:30.396 --> 00:32.140
They can cook, they love to do this.

00:32.222 --> 00:34.937
Little children love to make dinners for their grandparents.

00:35.371 --> 00:40.668
So on Grandparents Day, it would be wonderful to teach one of the old songs from way back when.

00:40.795 --> 00:45.161
And the important thing is to remember the act of doing it alongside of the grandparent.

00:45.248 --> 00:50.254
Think it's just spending the time interacting, the grandparent and the grandchild,...

00:50.451 --> 00:53.904
...building that relationship and nurturing each other.

00:54.018 --> 00:56.507
The interaction is so beneficial to both.
