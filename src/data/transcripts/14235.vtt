Nearly 3,000 people were killed on September 11th, 2001 when al-Qaeda hijackers...

00:10.069 --> 00:12.706
...crashed commercial planes into the World Trade Center,...

00:12.863 --> 00:15.494
...the Pentagon and the field in Pennsylvania.

00:16.083 --> 00:18.955
Among those killed was 26 - year - old James Cartier.

00:19.559 --> 00:23.730
He was working as an electrician on the 105th floor of the south tower...

00:23.889 --> 00:26.169
...when the plane slammed into the buildings.

00:26.825 --> 00:31.071
After his death, James's brother John launched American Brotherhood MC,...

00:31.559 --> 00:35.505
...a motorcycle club honoring one of James's favorite hobbies.

00:35.950 --> 00:38.234
I view this whole event different than most.

00:39.546 --> 00:41.146
I'm a survivor from the collapse.

00:41.722 --> 00:43.872
I was standing right in front of Century 21...

00:43.943 --> 00:48.189
...when the south tower came down on the middle of the street, holding my sister's hand.

00:48.777 --> 00:53.323
At the same time that me and my sister were running, my brother was losing his life.

00:54.689 --> 00:57.833
I returned to Ground Zero in the hopes to find my brother...

00:58.290 --> 01:02.206
...and stayed on there, on and off for seven and a half months in the recovery effort.

01:03.723 --> 01:08.250
Cartier says the motorcycle club helps keep the memory of his brother alive.

01:08.973 --> 01:13.489
What's important to me today, tomorrow, yesterday...

01:15.819 --> 01:19.305
...is the fact that my brother James was a beautiful human being.

01:20.094 --> 01:24.964
He was loving, he was caring, he was courteous, he was always a gentleman...

01:25.969 --> 01:27.361
...and his voice was silenced.

01:27.880 --> 01:34.279
So, I go forward every day and I feel good when I talk about him...

01:34.860 --> 01:40.086
...because it lets me tell the world who he was.

01:41.207 --> 01:44.735
Peter Marino's father, Lester, was also killed that day.

01:45.508 --> 01:49.516
It's definitely very emotional; it is very sad.

01:51.804 --> 01:53.381
It's very tough to get through.

01:55.403 --> 02:00.685
Of course, there's a lot of anger too but...

02:03.399 --> 02:05.812
...you try to be there for each other more than anything.

02:06.356 --> 02:10.517
It's great that everybody comes together and is there for each other, you know...

02:10.631 --> 02:12.170
...'cause everybody understands.

02:12.257 --> 02:15.421
Each year the family members of those killed on September 11th....

02:15.523 --> 02:19.303
...gather at the World Trade Center site for a memorial ceremony.
