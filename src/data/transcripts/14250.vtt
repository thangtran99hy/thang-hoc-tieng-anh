00:00.637 --> 00:04.256
Global warming is happening because humans have altered the Earth's atmosphere...

00:04.397 --> 00:06.145
...so the heat cannot escape from it.

00:06.561 --> 00:07.750
We need some heat, of course.

00:07.961 --> 00:11.753
Carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor retain enough heat from the sun...

00:11.849 --> 00:13.098
...to sustain life on Earth.

00:13.687 --> 00:15.966
But human activity has disrupted that balance.

00:16.361 --> 00:18.185
We've put carbon dioxide, methane...

00:18.272 --> 00:22.307
...and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere in massive amounts by burning fossil fuel,...

00:22.585 --> 00:24.163
...oil, gas and coal.

00:24.851 --> 00:26.345
We've cut down a lot of forests...

00:26.469 --> 00:29.835
...and use farming methods that add to the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

00:30.502 --> 00:34.337
Now, there's too much carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in the air.

00:35.169 --> 00:40.487
Today, the atmosphere contains 32 percent more carbon dioxide than it did in the mid-1800s.

00:41.192 --> 00:44.887
All those gases act like a blanket retaining too much of the sun's heat.

00:45.467 --> 00:48.726
That means we're fundamentally changing planet Earth's climate.

00:49.309 --> 00:53.518
Global average temperature has risen by .6-degree Celsius since 1900.

00:53.933 --> 00:56.190
The Northern Hemisphere is now substantially warmer...

00:56.311 --> 00:58.942
...than at any point during the past 1,000 years.

00:59.459 --> 01:00.968
And that is global warming.
