A long time ago when our great country was just being built,...

00:04.556 --> 00:05.400
...there were the haves...

00:06.856 --> 00:07.500
Money, money, money.

00:07.850 --> 00:08.600
...and the have-nots.

00:10.246 --> 00:12.187
The haves owned companies and industries...

00:12.543 --> 00:15.145
...and they relied on their workers to, well, do the hard work.

00:15.927 --> 00:17.161
The workers were proud of what they did.

00:17.700 --> 00:18.300
They worked hard every day.

00:19.148 --> 00:22.000
But they watched the companies and the haves get richer and richer...

00:22.563 --> 00:24.468
...while they got poorer or stayed the same.

00:24.974 --> 00:27.272
They had to work for as long as their bosses told them to work.

00:27.777 --> 00:29.673
They didn't get overtime pay, they didn't get to take a break...

00:30.377 --> 00:32.021
...and there was no guarantee they would be safe at work.

00:33.050 --> 00:34.294
If they got hurt or even killed...

00:34.650 --> 00:36.150
...the company didn't have to do anything about it.

00:36.999 --> 00:37.822
This isn't fair.

00:38.289 --> 00:40.079
The workers decided to do something about it.

00:40.937 --> 00:43.299
But it was hard, the companies could just fire them.

00:43.581 --> 00:44.306
Get lost!

00:44.751 --> 00:46.213
So the workers joined in unity.

00:47.392 --> 00:48.581
Together, they had a voice.

00:48.953 --> 00:52.707
Together, they could demand things like fair wage, safe working conditions,...

00:53.300 --> 00:56.351
...an end to child labor, sick leave, family leave, pensions.

00:56.721 --> 01:02.098
Together, labor unions created something in between the haves and the have-nots: the middle class.

01:02.811 --> 01:04.352
The middle class is very important.

01:04.736 --> 01:06.953
It allows people to make better lives for themselves.

01:07.565 --> 01:08.720
And the middle class has money to spend...

01:09.400 --> 01:11.821
...and when they buy things, that money goes back into our economy.

01:12.209 --> 01:13.711
And it makes America strong.
