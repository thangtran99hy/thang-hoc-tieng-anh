00:09.349 --> 00:12.597
If I were to rank, perhaps the top 20 individuals...

00:12.687 --> 00:14.663
...who helped to shape the world around us,...

00:15.143 --> 00:17.646
...I think Albert Einstein would be on that shortlist.

00:18.211 --> 00:20.439
Kings and queens, they come and go.

00:21.039 --> 00:26.626
Emperors and empresses, well, they leave almost no trace in the footprints of history.

00:27.108 --> 00:31.062
But Albert Einstein's work resonates throughout history even today.

00:31.673 --> 00:34.334
People ask the question, "What has Einstein done for me lately?"

00:34.767 --> 00:37.200
And the answer is, "Everything."

00:38.061 --> 00:39.229
Everything we see around us,...

00:39.804 --> 00:42.927
...the electronics, the satellites, the atom smashers,...

00:43.043 --> 00:47.015
...all of that in some sense, can be traced back to the work of Albert Einstein.

00:47.549 --> 00:50.727
In fact, many of the crumbs, the crumbs from his table,...

00:51.151 --> 00:54.882
...have gone on to win Nobel Prizes for physicists even today.
