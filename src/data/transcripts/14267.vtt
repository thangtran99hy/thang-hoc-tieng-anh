00:30.608 --> 00:33.722
I knew as soon as I looked at her that she was the one.

00:35.031 --> 00:38.071
It was magical, I can't describe it. I couldn't tell her that...

00:38.170 --> 00:40.067
...but I was like a 15-year-old again.

00:40.389 --> 00:43.987
I got all googly-eyed and didn't know what to do or say and...

00:44.193 --> 00:46.341
...stumbling; wasn't like me at all,...

00:46.977 --> 00:49.513
...wasn't the typical macho Italian guy from Brooklyn.

00:51.241 --> 00:53.025
When I met Karen, somehow she relaxed me.

00:53.388 --> 00:56.133
She just taught me patience, I had very little patience.

00:56.549 --> 00:59.935
Basically, I was one of those guys who rolled down the window and screamed at the drivers when...

01:00.071 --> 01:01.781
...they weren't driving the way I thought they should be.

01:02.224 --> 01:03.139
And she toned me down.

01:03.253 --> 01:07.301
She showed me to be nicer to people, give it a second thought before you start yelling.

01:07.767 --> 01:09.141
And I've carried that with me.

01:09.958 --> 01:13.190
Other than her going to work, there wasn't a time we weren't together.

01:13.694 --> 01:16.365
Every morning, Karen would drive with me to my office...

01:16.909 --> 01:20.670
... and then she'd take the subway from my office, one stop to the Trade Center. I worked in Brooklyn.

01:21.142 --> 01:25.107
From my window across the East River, I could see the twin towers.

01:25.551 --> 01:28.961
So I'm doing some work and one of my workers comes in and says, "Richie,"...

01:30.088 --> 01:32.226
..."I just heard that the Trade Center got hit with a plane."

01:32.552 --> 01:34.478
I turn around and I see the building burning.

01:34.978 --> 01:38.815
And I took my office chair and I threw it at my window.

01:39.321 --> 01:40.205
Then they brought the nurse up.

01:40.494 --> 01:42.569
She gives me a bottle of water. I have the bottle of water and...

01:43.009 --> 01:46.174
...it's in my hand and my hand is trembling so much that it's splashing all over me.

01:46.533 --> 01:47.970
I couldn't even hold the bottle in my hand.

01:49.473 --> 01:52.959
I miss her eyes. Her eyes sparkled to me.

01:53.957 --> 01:55.631
One day they were blue; next day they were green,...

01:56.167 --> 01:57.267
...depending on how the light hit them.

01:58.429 --> 02:00.511
Karen, I'll always be in love with you...

02:00.942 --> 02:02.355
...and I will see you again.

02:03.300 --> 02:04.921
I will do enough good to make it up there.
