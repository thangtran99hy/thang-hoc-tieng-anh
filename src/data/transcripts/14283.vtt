00:10.724 --> 00:12.078
Well, I hate buzzwords,...

00:13.955 --> 00:17.449
...but I think matching people, planets, and profits...

00:18.224 --> 00:20.033
...is not a bad one if you have to have one.

00:21.823 --> 00:28.484
And I think that, you know, I think first of all, people who create businesses,...

00:29.184 --> 00:32.240
...you have to ask, you know, "What are they doing?" What they're doing is...

00:32.967 --> 00:34.597
...trying to make a difference to people's lives.

00:34.735 --> 00:37.365
And if you make a difference, a positive difference to people's lives,...

00:37.791 --> 00:39.280
...you're gonna have a successful business.

00:40.477 --> 00:43.769
You know, about business, it should not be just about the shareholders...

00:43.883 --> 00:45.991
...and should not be just about the bottom line.

00:47.106 --> 00:51.167
And if you're running a business, you should be making a difference to people...

00:51.253 --> 00:53.109
...and making a difference to the world.

00:56.032 --> 01:00.128
And that difference to the world, you know, should be in these many different areas,...

01:02.976 --> 01:04.723
...you know, you can possibly cope with.

01:07.249 --> 01:12.815
There's no question that, you know, trying to work towards a cleaner world...

01:13.306 --> 01:19.275
...should be on the list. I think of every, you know, chief executive, chairman, president's,...

01:20.099 --> 01:21.967
...a business's agenda.
