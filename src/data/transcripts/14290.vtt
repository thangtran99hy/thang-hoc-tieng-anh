Hello. My name is Hiu. On behalf of Expert Village,...

00:04.603 --> 00:08.516
...I'm going to show several everyday Chinese dishes.

00:11.521 --> 00:20.099
Heat the wok over high heat. Add three tablespoons of cooking oil.

00:22.877 --> 00:28.913
And we will precook the beef slice before we do the stir-fry.

00:31.771 --> 00:39.423
The purpose of this precooking process is to just get the beef around medium well...

00:40.039 --> 00:41.952
...but we don't want it overcooked.

00:44.307 --> 00:48.525
As you see, there's still some pink color in the beef slice.

00:48.785 --> 00:53.070
That is what we are looking for in the precooking process.

00:56.666 --> 01:02.939
Then, leave the heat high. Add two to three tablespoons of oil again.

01:04.369 --> 01:11.119
And we will add the mixture of green onion, ginger, garlic and shallot...

01:11.982 --> 01:18.457
...and stir-fry them really well until you see the shallots look transparent...

01:19.427 --> 01:24.330
...and the green onions have become soft in texture.

01:27.509 --> 01:34.983
Then, we go add the beef slice back to the wok, so that we will fully cook the beef...

01:37.715 --> 01:42.307
...and we just want to stir-fry the beef for around 20 seconds.

01:47.907 --> 01:57.177
Then, add the sauce to the mixture and give one final toss,...

01:58.370 --> 02:02.345
...so that the sauce is mixed with all the ingredients.

02:04.797 --> 02:08.978
And then, we can put the dish on the plate.

02:16.129 --> 02:21.527
As you see, the stir-fry beef is ready.
