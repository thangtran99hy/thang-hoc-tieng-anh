Nobody has time these days.

00:02.939 --> 00:05.892
I haven't got it, you haven't got it but we still want delicious food.

00:06.365 --> 00:08.195
And that's why I've come up with a new way of cooking.

00:08.649 --> 00:10.431
It's called, "30 - Minute Meals".

00:10.738 --> 00:14.269
It's my step-by-step guide to making delicious meals from scratch.

00:15.035 --> 00:15.583
Nice!

00:16.105 --> 00:18.889
Follow me and I'll show you how to stop wasting time in the kitchen.

00:19.864 --> 00:23.507
And I'll give you the right recipes, the right attitude and all of my tricks of the trade.

00:23.859 --> 00:24.640
Just take my hand.

00:25.812 --> 00:29.383
Well, and I'll turn you into a lean, mean cooking machine.

00:35.259 --> 00:37.770
Good. Oh, that's it. Yeah, lower, lower.
