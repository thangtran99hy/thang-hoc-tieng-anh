Hello! Today I'm going to show you how I make my homemade ketchup...

00:07.012 --> 00:09.700
...with one container of tomato sauce...

00:12.071 --> 00:18.281
...and a little bit of syrup and a little bit of apple cider vinegar.

00:27.765 --> 00:32.509
And then three tablespoons of maple syrup.

00:38.743 --> 00:41.733
And one apple cider vinegar.

00:43.958 --> 00:49.839
Then we stir it. And now we're testing.
