Some people love Apple a lot...

00:11.639 --> 00:17.405
...in the US or UK, even in China, the tech firm's fastest growing market.

00:17.947 --> 00:22.779
And it's not just people who love Apple, shops do too.

00:23.627 --> 00:29.901
And this shop loves Apple so much, it really, really wants to be an Apple store.

00:30.729 --> 00:36.165
Inside, it looks like one of those manicured mansions of must-have gadgetry.

00:36.691 --> 00:38.585
Looks though are deceiving.

00:40.145 --> 00:43.539
Even though the items for sale seem to be the real deal,...

00:43.890 --> 00:50.000
...this shop and another just a few streets away are more than a little iffy.

00:50.775 --> 00:58.073
A keen - eyed American living here in Kunming realized Apple have no official stores in the city;...

00:58.808 --> 01:01.626
...news it seems, to employees.

01:05.031 --> 01:06.917
We only sell real Apple products.

01:06.986 --> 01:10.023
If you ask me if this store is authorized by Apple, I don't know.

01:10.345 --> 01:11.505
You'd need to ask the boss.

01:12.705 --> 01:14.561
Gadgets are big business.

01:14.761 --> 01:18.531
And counterfeit Apple goods are a big problem for the firm...

01:18.898 --> 01:22.077
...and the intellectual property police in China.

01:22.660 --> 01:25.894
Counterfeit shops though, seems to be a new challenge.

01:26.315 --> 01:31.874
A challenge that could be fueled by disloyal or just confused shoppers.

01:33.052 --> 01:35.171
As long as their products are real, it's okay.

01:35.438 --> 01:39.422
After all when you enter the store, you're looking at their products and not anything else.

01:40.453 --> 01:41.562
I wouldn't shop there.

01:41.667 --> 01:43.651
It's a violation of property rights...

01:43.740 --> 01:45.699
...and probably just cosmetically similar.

01:46.243 --> 01:49.413
How can you be so sure of a quality product or service?

01:50.173 --> 01:55.381
Apple have not made an official statement about the unofficial shops.

01:55.766 --> 02:01.379
It is a safe bet though they'll be looking to root out potentially rotten cores.
