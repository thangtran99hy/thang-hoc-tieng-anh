00:05.481 --> 00:09.614
Train your puppy to sleep through the night and you might finally get a full night's rest, too.

00:10.920 --> 00:19.076
You will need a feeding schedule, exercise, a puppy bed or a crate, and a hot water bottle or heating pad.

00:19.661 --> 00:24.197
Step one: Get your puppy on a regular feeding schedule and follow it strictly...

00:24.300 --> 00:26.889
...so you'll know when your puppy needs to take care of his business.

00:27.623 --> 00:30.171
Don't give your puppy food or water later in the evening.

00:30.518 --> 00:32.343
Set a cutoff time of seven pm.

00:33.035 --> 00:36.902
Step two: Give your puppy plenty of exercise during the day.

00:37.293 --> 00:39.763
Go for a walk after work or play fetch in the yard.

00:40.162 --> 00:44.581
Wind things down with a more gentle activity like brushing or petting close to bedtime.

00:45.260 --> 00:50.131
Step three: Take the puppy outside right before bedtime even if they don't have to go.

00:50.403 --> 00:52.467
They'll eventually learn what's expected of them.

00:53.177 --> 00:57.755
Step four: Set up a bed or crate in your bedroom, preferably next to your bed.

00:58.170 --> 01:01.217
The puppy will take sleeping cues from you when it's time for lights out.

01:02.228 --> 01:07.575
If the puppy must sleep in another room, put a white noise machine or ticking clock nearby to soothe them.

01:07.997 --> 01:12.531
Step five: Expect that the puppy won't be able to make it through the night for a while.

01:12.929 --> 01:17.619
If they cry, go out for a potty break immediately and then return the puppy directly to bed.

01:18.081 --> 01:20.117
Eventually, they'll be able to hold it longer.

01:20.635 --> 01:23.885
Don't play with them or they'll wake you up each time they want to get frisky.

01:24.433 --> 01:29.897
Step six: Make a new puppy feel more at home by placing a hot water bottle or heating pad...

01:29.985 --> 01:33.061
...under a blanket in their sleeping area to imitate their litter mates.

01:33.527 --> 01:36.801
Soon, both the puppy and you will sleep like a baby.

01:37.914 --> 01:41.513
Did you know? Dalmatian puppies are born with a pure white coat.

01:41.674 --> 01:43.209
Their spots develop as they mature.
