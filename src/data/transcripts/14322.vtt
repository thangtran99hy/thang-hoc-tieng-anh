Hi I'm Marc Bauer from the French Culinary Institute.

00:08.001 --> 00:10.236
I'm gonna show you how to separate eggs.

00:10.927 --> 00:13.514
That means I'm gonna separate the whites from the yolk.

00:14.144 --> 00:20.324
First, I crack the egg on the side of a bowl or on a cutting board...

00:21.191 --> 00:25.474
...and I separate with my thumbs into two shells.

00:26.437 --> 00:29.851
Of course, I have a bowl below and the egg white falls into it.

00:30.779 --> 00:33.232
Go back and forth until everything is separated.

00:33.841 --> 00:36.775
In case you get a little egg shell, either in the white or the yolk,...

00:37.225 --> 00:39.567
...you can separate it with a spoon...

00:40.249 --> 00:43.975
...or you can let them sit for a while, especially in the egg whites...

00:44.414 --> 00:46.479
...and the shell will fall to the bottom.

00:46.661 --> 00:50.085
Just make sure you don't pour it into the final product. 

00:51.011 --> 00:52.115
That's how you separate eggs.
