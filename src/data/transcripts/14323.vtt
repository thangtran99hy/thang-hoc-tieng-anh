I love being outside. Nature is one of my favorite hobbies.

00:04.552 --> 00:07.009
I like to hike, I like to kayak, I like to canoe.

00:07.601 --> 00:12.138
There's one thing that I sure don't like about being outside and that is mosquito bites.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.309
They just love me; they can't get enough of me.

00:14.964 --> 00:16.724
Well, a lot of people might ask the question,...

00:17.377 --> 00:19.400
..."Why does a mosquito bite you in the first place?"

00:20.071 --> 00:23.247
I'm Janice Creneti. I've been teaching environmental science for over 20 years...

00:23.323 --> 00:26.449
...and I'm here to answer the question, "Why do mosquitoes suck blood?"

00:27.368 --> 00:30.355
Well, first of all one thing that's not commonly understood...

00:30.513 --> 00:34.545
...is that it's actually only of the females of the species that are going after your blood.

00:35.183 --> 00:38.163
You see most species of mosquitoes, males and females,...

00:38.249 --> 00:39.702
...when they're just trying to feed themselves,...

00:39.846 --> 00:42.315
...they actually eat nectar, just sort of like a bee.

00:42.685 --> 00:47.455
They have a long tubelike mouth part that's good for sticking into flowers to get pollen,...

00:47.553 --> 00:48.454
...to get nectar out,...

00:49.843 --> 00:54.956
...but the female of the species needs something special when she's going to lay her eggs,...

00:55.273 --> 00:56.969
...and that's what she gets from the human blood.

00:57.389 --> 01:01.980
She needs irons and protein to properly form the eggs and actually be able to lay them.

01:02.383 --> 01:06.048
That's why she has to go after you and me when we're outside enjoying a summer evening.

01:07.206 --> 01:11.317
Now, the thing about mosquitoes is they can also carry disease and that becomes a problem...

01:11.398 --> 01:14.811
...as they're sucking blood from one person and flying over to bite somebody else.

01:15.172 --> 01:17.476
They can even carry diseases in your pets as well.

01:17.791 --> 01:21.444
If your dog has ever gotten heartworm, a mosquito is probably the culprit.

01:22.239 --> 01:24.097
So, watch out for those mosquitoes.

01:24.192 --> 01:27.292
Use insect repellent when you're outside and protect your pets as well.

01:27.985 --> 01:30.842
