00:03.103 --> 00:04.393
Yeah, one of the things that,...

00:05.445 --> 00:07.896
...the question of what's uniquely human is actually a big one.

00:08.102 --> 00:10.368
Depending on who you ask, you might get really different answers.

00:10.747 --> 00:13.627
If I had to put my money on something that was actually uniquely human,...

00:14.050 --> 00:17.567
...it seems, in some funny way, to be our motivation to actually...

00:17.963 --> 00:19.496
...interact with others, in a funny way.

00:19.937 --> 00:23.743
And what I mean by this is that generally, if you look at any human anywhere,...

00:23.867 --> 00:25.237
...if they're hanging out with other humans,...

00:25.587 --> 00:28.715
...they're often doing something with or showing something to another individual.

00:29.039 --> 00:32.699
So, you see something cool and you say, "Oh! Hey, look at this cool thing."

00:33.105 --> 00:35.497
And to psychologists, this is this process of reference.

00:35.581 --> 00:38.287
Traits of sharing, referring to information out there in the world.

00:38.730 --> 00:40.171
And it seems like, in other primates,...

00:40.317 --> 00:42.842
...even though you think this is kind of a simple ability, they seem to lack...

00:42.959 --> 00:44.585
...at least the motivation to do this.

00:45.448 --> 00:49.171
This leads to the fact that they don't have the kind of communication that we have.

00:49.553 --> 00:52.909
The things like language with nouns that can kind of point to things out there in the world.

00:53.785 --> 00:57.226
They also don't seem to share their own desires and intentions with others,...

00:57.850 --> 01:01.542
...which leads to a lack of kind of cooperation in a lot of domains.

01:01.632 --> 01:04.258
So, if I had to put my money on what was uniquely human,...

01:04.742 --> 01:07.888
...I'd go with the kind of motivation to share information with others.
