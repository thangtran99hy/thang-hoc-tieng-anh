There needs to be one day, a universal day;...

00:11.701 --> 00:15.799
...that is all people all around the world just focus on peace.

00:23.785 --> 00:28.412
The International Day of Peace becomes a total global observation.

00:28.533 --> 00:30.770
It's observed around the world in every country.

00:30.989 --> 00:34.107
And everyone on the planet knows about it and observes it on some level.

00:42.505 --> 00:45.385
The International Day of Peace is an opportunity...

00:45.607 --> 00:50.612
...for all of humanity to observe a day of peace together.

00:50.773 --> 00:54.561
And in 1981, the UN established...

00:54.935 --> 00:59.621
...by an announced resolution of all member nations, the International Day of Peace.

00:59.817 --> 01:02.957
And through that, the world comes together as unified.

01:22.432 --> 01:28.472
There are thousands and thousands of events all over the world...

01:28.741 --> 01:30.719
...on the International Day of Peace.

01:31.959 --> 01:36.415
What I believe that the International Day of Peace can do is really inspire people...

01:36.509 --> 01:39.639
...especially the young people to really grasp that peace...

01:39.756 --> 01:42.553
...is a value that I believe is in everybody's heart.

01:49.079 --> 01:53.964
And somebody asked me what could they do on the International Day of Peace...

01:54.554 --> 01:59.177
...and I said you can do anything that makes the world a better place.
