Baby birds sometimes fall from their nests,...

00:09.083 --> 00:12.289
...and sometimes are knocked out by storms or other natural causes.

00:12.455 --> 00:14.903
If you find a baby bird, here's how to feed it.

00:15.500 --> 00:20.704
You will need: a container, a heating pad, dog kibble, hot sugar water,...

00:20.962 --> 00:28.786
...a bowl, a spoon, hard-boiled eggs, baby cereal, toothpicks, canned cat or dog food, lean raw beef and fruit.

00:29.515 --> 00:34.387
Step 1 : Place the baby bird in a container on top of a heating pad to keep it warm.

00:35.758 --> 00:37.600
Handle the bird only when necessary.

00:38.467 --> 00:43.205
Step 2 : Prepare the food by soaking dog kibble in hot sugar water for one hour.

00:43.845 --> 00:48.991
Step 3 : Remove the kibble from the water and mix it with baby cereal and a hard-boiled egg.

00:49.353 --> 00:52.252
Feed the baby bird with this mixture for the first couple of days.

00:53.037 --> 00:58.726
Step 4 : Make a pea - size ball with the food mixture and place it in the baby's mouth using a toothpick.

00:59.508 --> 01:02.072
Never force food or water into the bird's mouth.

01:02.833 --> 01:07.005
Step 5 : Feed the bird every 15 minutes over the first couple of days.

01:07.377 --> 01:10.244
When it's stronger, feed it every 30 to 60 minutes.

01:10.685 --> 01:17.317
Step 6 : Feed the baby bird room temperature canned dog food, lean raw beef and fruit after the first couple of days.

01:18.109 --> 01:22.406
Step 7 : Wean it away from hand - feeding once it starts moving around.

01:23.620 --> 01:30.593
Did you know? In 2007, an ostrich egg set a record for the largest egg from a living bird at five pounds nine ounces.
