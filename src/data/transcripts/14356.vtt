00:11.952 --> 00:16.529
This morning, I got up and got ready quickly because I have to get a lot of stuff done.

00:16.855 --> 00:19.685
I sat down at my desk to start getting my stuff done...

00:19.769 --> 00:22.815
...and I spilled my coffee so I got a sponge to clean it up.

00:23.001 --> 00:25.838
And I figured I'd take an extra minute to clean the whole desk...

00:25.978 --> 00:28.516
...because a clean desk would help me get my stuff done.

00:29.010 --> 00:31.791
When I was finished, I realized I hadn't eaten anything...

00:31.885 --> 00:34.608
...and I didn't wanna be hungry while I got my stuff done.

00:34.699 --> 00:37.147
So I went into the kitchen and I was out of cereal.

00:37.625 --> 00:41.539
When I got into the grocery store, I remembered a bunch of other crap I needed to get.

00:41.623 --> 00:44.751
And I figured I was already there so I did my shopping for the week...

00:44.863 --> 00:47.755
...so I didn't have to worry about it while I got my stuff done.

00:48.178 --> 00:51.903
When I got home, I didn't feel like cereal anymore and so I made an omelet...

00:51.969 --> 00:55.601
...and I did the dishes so I wouldn't have to do them after I got my stuff done.

00:55.685 --> 00:58.436
And then I went out to get some oil from the hardware store...

00:58.509 --> 01:00.473
...because my desk chair is kind of squeaky...

01:00.568 --> 01:04.487
...and I didn't want to be distracted by a squeaky chair while I got my stuff done.

01:04.950 --> 01:06.976
When I got back it was getting kind of late...

01:07.070 --> 01:09.549
...and I knew I wouldn't be able to get my stuff done today...

01:09.637 --> 01:12.850
...so I started watching the Twilight Zone marathon on TV.

01:13.237 --> 01:17.285
I just have to make sure I get to bed early because I want to be well rested tomorrow...

01:17.395 --> 01:18.878
...so I can get my stuff done.
