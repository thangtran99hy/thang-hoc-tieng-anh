Mayonnaise, but don't be scared of making it.

00:08.534 --> 00:12.159
Basically all it is is emulsification of raw egg yolks and groundnut oil.

00:12.387 --> 00:15.135
Groundnut oil because it's a neutral oil, it's not flavored.

00:16.158 --> 00:19.620
Three egg yolks, teaspoon of English mustard.

00:19.971 --> 00:21.777
And the mustard gives the mayonnaise a little bit of heat.

00:22.909 --> 00:23.627
Now, lid on.

00:23.977 --> 00:27.084
If you haven't got a mixer, you can whisk it by hand but this is a lot quicker.

00:29.777 --> 00:34.221
Once you've mixed it, this is where it's really important that we add the oil slowly.

00:34.921 --> 00:37.172
The first 30 seconds of making a mayonnaise is the most crucial.

00:37.481 --> 00:40.566
Slowly with the oil, that stops it from splitting.

00:42.679 --> 00:44.621
This is 300 ml of groundnut oil.

00:44.952 --> 00:46.425
Drizzle into the eggs.

00:48.313 --> 00:50.337
And you never season mayonnaise until the end.

00:50.781 --> 00:53.834
When you season it to begin with, it destroys the egg yolks.

00:54.511 --> 00:56.243
Now we can add the oil a little bit quicker.

00:57.076 --> 01:02.959
You can just hear that sound when it goes from liquid to really nice, thick mayonnaise.

01:05.659 --> 01:14.019
Now season it, salt, pepper, fresh lemon juice.

01:14.436 --> 01:18.858
That gives it a really nice sort of zesty freshness, makes it exuberant.

01:20.221 --> 01:21.559
And then just a quick blast.

01:23.963 --> 01:29.422
And what we're looking for is this really nice, soft, creamy textured mayonnaise.

01:29.635 --> 01:30.042
Beautiful!

01:30.436 --> 01:33.347
Looks fantastic and tastes delicious.

01:33.705 --> 01:34.075
Right.

01:34.353 --> 01:35.412
Keep it in the fridge.
