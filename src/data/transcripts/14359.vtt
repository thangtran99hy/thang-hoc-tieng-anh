Scientists studying Antarctic waters have filmed and captured giant sea creatures never seen before.

00:07.639 --> 00:10.604
They saw sea spiders the size of dinner plates...

00:11.001 --> 00:13.956
...and jellyfish with six-meter-long tentacles.

00:14.439 --> 00:18.235
They also filmed other unknown species of sea life. Here's more.

00:21.915 --> 00:26.446
A fleet of three Antarctic marine research ships returned to Australia this week,...

00:26.592 --> 00:29.198
...ending a summer expedition to the southern ocean...

00:29.494 --> 00:32.637
...where they carried out a census of life in the icy ocean...

00:32.809 --> 00:36.000
...and on its floor, more than one kilometer below the surface.

00:36.673 --> 00:42.707
Huge diversity of life, very colorful, very rich far exceeding any  of our expectations.

00:43.261 --> 00:48.353
The three ships all docked in Hobart on Australia's southern island state of Tasmania...

00:48.762 --> 00:53.525
Their decks are full of an array of sea life, including unknown species of sea creatures...

00:53.661 --> 00:56.405
...collected near the eastern Antarctic land mass.

00:57.193 --> 00:59.777
The Australian Antarctic division expedition...

00:59.872 --> 01:05.025
...will help scientists monitor the impact of environmental change in Antarctic waters.
