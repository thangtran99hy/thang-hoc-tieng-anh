A new fish has been discovered off the coast of Indonesia.

00:03.772 --> 00:07.715
And besides being beautiful, it has a unique way of moving through the water.

00:08.057 --> 00:08.812
Let's take a look.

00:10.540 --> 00:14.751
The University of Washington scientist, who this month officially described...

00:14.911 --> 00:19.507
...this new species of fish, chose to call it Histiophryne psychedelica...

00:19.986 --> 00:23.587
...or H. psychedelica for its orange and brown stripes.

00:24.810 --> 00:31.102
H. psychedelica was first spotted in the harbor of Ambon Island in Indonesia in January 2008.

00:32.080 --> 00:36.410
It took more than a year of testing by the university's Professor Ted Pietsch...

00:36.836 --> 00:39.073
...to establish that it was indeed unique.

00:40.449 --> 00:45.934
DNA work revealed that the fish is of the genus Histiophryne along with two other species,...

00:46.397 --> 00:49.937
...although its two cousins are far less spectacular in appearance.

00:50.697 --> 00:54.982
The genus is one of about a dozen in the family commonly known as frogfish.

00:56.049 --> 01:00.561
Despite its showy appearance, H. psychedelica is shy and secretive...

01:00.904 --> 01:04.109
...and Professor Pietsch says, its reluctance to show off...

01:04.513 --> 01:08.044
...may explain why it has managed to stay hidden for so long.
