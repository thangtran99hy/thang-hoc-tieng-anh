Rule one of cooking, always use a sharp knife, so...

00:04.972 --> 00:07.383
...make sure you get that sorted out before we go live.

00:09.066 --> 00:12.209
It's far harder working in a kitchen with a blunt knife than it is with a sharp knife.

00:12.609 --> 00:16.732
The secret behind keeping a sharp knife, sharpen it before and every time you use it.

00:17.249 --> 00:19.905
First, grip the steel. It really comes about holding the steel.

00:20.245 --> 00:22.991
Imagine you're holding a tennis racket or you're playing squash.

00:23.145 --> 00:24.339
Got to be really comfortable with it.

00:24.617 --> 00:28.023
Now, 45 degrees. Confident grip, confident grip with the knife.

00:28.510 --> 00:32.013
This is the birth of the steel. Really important you keep your fingers behind there.

00:32.295 --> 00:34.397
You never grip a steel with your fingers over that...

00:34.807 --> 00:37.147
...'cause the knife comes back in. You've just lost a finger.

00:37.477 --> 00:39.137
Always grip behind.

00:39.869 --> 00:45.217
Nice long strokes so we get the whole of the blade over the steel.

00:46.116 --> 00:49.183
Stroke, and we start from the bottom to the top.

00:49.498 --> 00:56.403
So there, across. There, across. Slow strokes over the top of the steel.

00:56.739 --> 01:01.821
And then, come back underneath. Then, back underneath. Then, back underneath.

01:02.370 --> 01:07.231
Away. And then, start the rhythm. It's like playing the drum.

01:07.808 --> 01:11.555
Away, away, away, away. Nice and slow.

01:11.977 --> 01:15.310
Away, back underneath and get really nice and comfortable.

01:15.586 --> 01:18.015
And relax your arms, and relax your wrist.

01:18.293 --> 01:23.097
Under, over, under, over, under, over.

01:23.444 --> 01:27.413
It's so dangerous working in the kitchen with a blunt knife. You can cause so much damage.

01:27.803 --> 01:30.718
Working with a sharp knife is ten times quicker, more efficient.

01:31.087 --> 01:33.979
Now, that's ready to start chopping.
