Hi, I'm Sarah from Instructables...

00:03.383 --> 00:06.417
...and today I'm going to show you how to make an awesome chocolate cake.

00:06.729 --> 00:10.306
In one mug, with one microwave, in under five minutes.

00:10.743 --> 00:12.814
So, we've got some very basic ingredients here.

00:13.673 --> 00:18.353
We need four tablespoons of flour, four tablespoons of sugar,...

00:18.882 --> 00:26.440
... one heaping tablespoon of cocoa, three tablespoons of milk, three tablespoons of oil,...

00:26.985 --> 00:30.873
...two tablespoons of whisked egg and a splash of vanilla.

00:31.366 --> 00:32.727
And now we're gonna mix it all up.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.015
Doesn't that look good?

00:36.921 --> 00:38.611
Finally, we're going to add chocolate chips.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.747
About three tablespoons, but pretty much as much as you like is fine.

00:42.199 --> 00:45.789
Because chocolate chips is what's gonna take this cake from good to amazing.

00:46.065 --> 00:47.463
It's ready for the microwave.

00:47.745 --> 00:50.951
While it's cooking, you might notice it rise over the top of the mug.

00:51.059 --> 00:52.455
And that's fine, that's what you want.

00:53.145 --> 00:54.963
If it spills over the top of the mug,...

00:55.113 --> 00:56.740
...it's still okay, it still tastes good.

00:56.991 --> 00:58.701
But next time get a bigger mug.

00:59.698 --> 01:00.462
There it goes.

01:01.824 --> 01:04.591
Rising, rising, looking good.

01:07.156 --> 01:08.043
Oh my gosh!

01:08.942 --> 01:09.622
It's perfect.

01:10.139 --> 01:12.067
