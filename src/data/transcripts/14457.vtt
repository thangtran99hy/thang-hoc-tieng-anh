I got Harbor when he was nine weeks old.

00:03.777 --> 00:06.697
And he used to trip on his ears walking.

00:07.331 --> 00:10.610
And down the stairs, he used to roll down the stairs because he would trip on them.

00:10.896 --> 00:15.337
And he still sometimes trips on them but not as much as he did when he was just a little pup.

00:15.899 --> 00:20.535
I sometimes play with his ears to make kids or friends laugh.

00:20.532 --> 00:23.619
We put them up on his head like Princess Leia.

00:25.187 --> 00:27.516
Or cover his face with an ear if he's napping.

00:30.613 --> 00:35.041
When Harbor and I are walking down the street, almost every person we pass...

00:35.231 --> 00:37.220
...says something about his ears.

00:37.513 --> 00:40.822
I've had a lot of people take photos of him, strangers on the street.

00:41.423 --> 00:43.033
I've had garbage trucks pull over...

00:43.486 --> 00:46.100
...and the garbage man get out of the driver seat and jump down to pet him...

00:46.144 --> 00:47.699
...and meet him because of his ears.

00:48.268 --> 00:53.633
And I don't even see his ears anymore, most days I forget how really oddly long they are.

00:54.017 --> 00:57.550
It's really fun to be the owner of a Guinness World Record holder.

00:58.829 --> 01:03.552
The credit goes to my nephew, who started the process of being here today and...

01:05.895 --> 01:08.365
...his proud owner. I think it's a riot.
