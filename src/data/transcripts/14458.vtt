It's hard to believe these tiny little bubbles of life...

00:04.701 --> 00:08.366
...could grow into 30 - foot monsters in just three years.

00:10.895 --> 00:14.712
Already the cold was starting to get to me. We had only a few more minutes...

00:14.846 --> 00:17.272
...and it looked like the female was all we were going to find.

00:18.749 --> 00:25.743
But then, a trail of destruction. The smashed remains of giant octopus snacks.

00:29.338 --> 00:31.892
Obviously, something is eating here, and eating well, apparently.

00:32.276 --> 00:33.012
They eat crab claw.

00:39.626 --> 00:41.540
Oh my hat!

00:55.915 --> 00:56.491
You alright?

00:57.235 --> 00:57.522
Hey?

00:57.807 --> 00:58.454
Are you alright?

00:59.181 --> 01:02.755
Scary, but he's just checking me out. I hope.

01:03.006 --> 01:05.339
Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.

01:12.223 --> 01:16.790
Although giant octopi are strong, they run out of energy surprisingly fast.

01:17.586 --> 01:21.329
They have bad circulation and need three hearts to pump their blood.

01:22.217 --> 01:26.939
Octopus blood is weird. It's pale blue and not very good at carrying oxygen,...

01:27.508 --> 01:31.395
...which is why they need this cold oxygen - rich water so badly.
