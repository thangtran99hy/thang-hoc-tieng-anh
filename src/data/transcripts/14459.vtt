00:00.513 --> 00:04.781
There's a battle on the way to take control of the smartphone and tablet market.

00:05.139 --> 00:09.553
The way that all of us, if not already, will access the Internet in the future.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.397
It's a struggle for dominance.

00:11.635 --> 00:15.805
Google, Apple, Microsoft and Blackberry are all fighting for our attention.

00:16.142 --> 00:19.319
Google, the company, that for many of us defines the Internet,...

00:19.637 --> 00:23.783
...has agreed to buy the company that once defined mobiles: Motorola.

00:23.968 --> 00:27.759
It's a deal worth a colossal 12.5 billion dollars.

00:28.073 --> 00:32.244
Google already owns the Android mobile phone and tablet operating system.

00:32.508 --> 00:35.129
That's the rival to Apple's iPhones and iPads.

00:35.364 --> 00:37.157
What's at stake is massive.

00:37.374 --> 00:40.695
And at the moment, Google's Android is slightly in the lead,...

00:40.923 --> 00:43.803
...with 150 million devices around the world.

00:44.193 --> 00:48.646
The key difference is, that until the planned acquisition of Motorola, announced today,...

00:48.901 --> 00:52.327
...Google didn't actually manufacture devices running Android.

00:52.702 --> 00:57.763
Unlike Apple, which of course makes huge profits from manufacturing the iPad and iPhone.

00:58.217 --> 01:01.920
As from today, Google becomes a credible rival to Apple,...

01:02.219 --> 01:07.791
...for the first time making bits of technology, rather than simply creating computer algorithms.

01:08.210 --> 01:11.919
But this still, is about much more than just manufacturing phones.

01:12.161 --> 01:16.143
It's a defensive move in an increasingly acrimonious legal battle...

01:16.355 --> 01:20.024
...between Google and all of its rivals, especially Apple.

01:20.441 --> 01:24.712
Google's Android has been accused of infringing the patents of many companies.

01:25.085 --> 01:29.013
Motorola owns more mobile patents than any other company.

01:29.203 --> 01:34.307
It has 17,000 patents and a further 7,500 that are pending.

01:34.648 --> 01:39.892
Compared to just over 3,000 for Apple and 10,000 for Microsoft partner, Nokia.

01:40.397 --> 01:45.756
Google hopes this advantage in patents will help secure the future of the Android system.

01:46.164 --> 01:49.586
Wherein the real value here is not in the hardware and not on the licensing, not at all.

01:49.963 --> 01:55.348
Google and Facebook and Apple and Microsoft want us to generate as many signals...

01:55.431 --> 01:57.651
...about ourselves as they can get us to do.

01:57.929 --> 02:00.145
Where we are, who we are, what we're doing, what we like,...

02:00.239 --> 02:01.561
...what we're shopping for and so on.

02:01.949 --> 02:05.689
Then they can target their content services and advertising to us.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.661
That's where the value is here.

02:07.954 --> 02:10.885
And Google's strategy is that if Android is ubiquitous,...

02:11.097 --> 02:13.934
...then Google will get maximum value out of that because of course,...

02:14.031 --> 02:16.481
...when we're online, what do we all use? Google.

02:17.955 --> 02:20.787
Three months ago, the chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt,...

02:21.015 --> 02:24.287
...told me that Google is now a mobile - first company.

02:24.636 --> 02:28.709
It's redefined its mission as we've changed the way we access the Internet.

02:29.102 --> 02:33.133
Today's deal has the potential to further change our technology habits...

02:33.380 --> 02:35.701
...in Google's favor all over again.
