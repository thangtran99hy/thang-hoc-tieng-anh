Cupcakes are a favorite treat for so many kids and even adults.

00:07.804 --> 00:12.387
And this clever and unusual way to serve them will surely bring a smile to anyone who has one.

00:12.707 --> 00:15.853
I'm Liv Hansen for howdini.com and Betty Crocker Kitchens.

00:16.067 --> 00:19.400
And I'm gonna show you how easy these surprise cupcakes are to make.

00:20.161 --> 00:25.359
You'll need some wafer cones, cupcakes, mini cupcakes, frosting and candy.

00:25.639 --> 00:26.403
So, let's get started.

00:26.863 --> 00:33.275
I'm gonna take my cone and fill it with candy, just about halfway.

00:36.097 --> 00:37.839
So now, remove the cupcake liner.

00:42.301 --> 00:43.637
Take a dollop of frosting...

00:46.413 --> 00:48.147
...and place it on top and spread it evenly.

00:49.171 --> 00:51.440
Then, invert the cupcake into the cone.

00:51.986 --> 00:54.994
Place another dollop of frosting on top of this cupcake.

00:57.755 --> 01:01.205
Then, take a mini cupcake and invert it right on top.

01:03.421 --> 01:05.511
Now, it's time to frost our ice cream cone.

01:08.634 --> 01:10.401
We want it to look like a soft-serve cone.

01:10.841 --> 01:14.141
I'm just gonna cover the entire surface with frosting.

01:15.813 --> 01:18.355
I hold the cone in my hand. I think that's the easiest way.

01:21.446 --> 01:22.638
And once we have it all covered,...

01:23.468 --> 01:26.584
...we'll give it a little texture to imitate the soft-serve look.

01:29.151 --> 01:31.497
So, to do that, I'm just gonna run my spatula around.

01:39.951 --> 01:41.619
The final touch - sprinkles!

01:49.295 --> 01:50.801
And there you have your cupcake cone.

01:51.138 --> 01:54.469
