You've seen the word, you've seen the websites and you may even have one.

00:03.903 --> 00:07.051
But have you ever wondered, "What's the big deal about blogs?"

00:07.799 --> 00:09.761
This is "Blogs in Plain English."

00:10.455 --> 00:13.615
To make sense of blogs, you have to think about the news and who makes it.

00:14.176 --> 00:17.808
We'll look at news in the 20th century versus the 21st century to make our point.

00:18.492 --> 00:20.900
In the 20th century, the news was produced professionally.

00:21.339 --> 00:23.291
When news happened, reporters wrote the stories...

00:23.395 --> 00:26.809
...and a tiny group of people decided what appeared in a newspaper or broadcast.

00:27.165 --> 00:30.271
Professional news was mainstream, general and limited.

00:30.839 --> 00:34.665
The 21st century marked the point where news became both professional and personal.

00:35.248 --> 00:38.413
A new kind of website called a web blog, or blog for short,...

00:38.809 --> 00:42.971
...came on to the scene and let anyone be a reporter and publisher, often for free.

00:43.591 --> 00:46.499
As blogs became popular, they created millions of news sources...

00:46.571 --> 00:49.474
...that gave everyone an audience for their own version of news.

00:49.947 --> 00:53.437
With a blog, a business owner can share news about his business,...

00:53.941 --> 00:58.543
...a mother can share news about her family or a sports star can share news with fans.

00:59.102 --> 01:00.980
These people are all bloggers.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.123
How did this happen?

01:02.577 --> 01:05.191
Well, blogs made sharing news on the web easy.

01:05.563 --> 01:08.375
Anyone with an idea can start a new blog with a click of a button...

01:08.483 --> 01:09.933
...and share news minutes later.

01:10.329 --> 01:11.364
Here's how blogs work.

01:11.693 --> 01:14.770
Blogs are websites that are organized by blog posts.

01:15.186 --> 01:17.991
These are individual news stories, like articles in the paper.

01:18.463 --> 01:21.655
Bloggers simply fill out a form like this one to post a new story.

01:22.181 --> 01:25.278
With the click of a button, the blog post appears at the top of the web page,...

01:25.481 --> 01:26.879
...just above yesterday's news.

01:27.373 --> 01:32.241
Over time, the blog becomes a collection of these posts, all archived for easy reference.

01:32.653 --> 01:36.548
Also, each blog post can become a discussion through comments left by readers.

01:37.102 --> 01:39.305
Blogs make the news a two-way street.

01:39.705 --> 01:42.123
But really, the fuss is not about how blogs work.

01:42.581 --> 01:45.123
It's about what people like you do with them that matters.

01:45.451 --> 01:46.949
Bloggers often work together.

01:47.351 --> 01:50.093
In addition to comments, you'll read each other's posts,...

01:50.479 --> 01:52.952
...quote each other and link your blogs together.

01:53.451 --> 01:57.100
This creates communities of bloggers that inspire and motivate each other.

01:57.485 --> 02:01.462
Since 2003 there have been over 70 million blogs created,...

02:01.737 --> 02:03.382
...each with its own version of news.

02:03.801 --> 02:08.000
So the big deal about blogs is that they gave people like you the power of the media...

02:08.363 --> 02:13.262
...and created a personal kind of news that appeals to a high number of small audiences.

02:13.803 --> 02:14.975
So, it's up to you.

02:15.338 --> 02:16.771
What will you do with this new power?

02:17.281 --> 02:20.869
There is likely a group of people out there who want to hear what you have to say.

02:21.504 --> 02:25.089
You can search for blogs using Google's Blog Search or Technorati.

02:25.425 --> 02:29.472
You can also start your own blog for free at Blogger or Wordpress.com.
