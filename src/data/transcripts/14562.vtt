00:00.187 --> 00:01.757
Elvis was very spiritual.

00:02.939 --> 00:09.732
He believed that he had a certain connection with God; not so much more than anybody else did.

00:10.309 --> 00:15.195
But in his search, he was trying to get close to God, so he felt that by helping others,...

00:16.371 --> 00:17.659
...maybe that was his mission.

00:24.423 --> 00:27.365
We got to Vegas and one of the girls in the group, Sylvia,...

00:28.221 --> 00:36.002
...has had a health problem. She has had the test but left before the results.

00:36.895 --> 00:38.491
And when she got to Las Vegas...

00:38.623 --> 00:43.611
...there were urgent emergency calls from her doctors...

00:43.700 --> 00:45.713
...to get in touch with them as soon as possible.

00:47.037 --> 00:52.424
And then her test had come back with a problem...

00:53.957 --> 00:59.439
...and so there was some talk that she has had cancer.

00:59.851 --> 01:03.521
So after the show, we're all down and Elvis comes over...

01:03.739 --> 01:06.187
...as he did every night to address everyone and say good night.

01:07.081 --> 01:09.462
And we're down and he asked "Yes, why?"

01:10.346 --> 01:12.032
We explained to him what the problem was...

01:12.925 --> 01:18.922
...so he took us, the three of us, and we went to the dressing area of our dressing room...

01:19.900 --> 01:22.414
...and he said let's pray.

01:23.553 --> 01:31.125
And as he prayed he touched Sylvia's stomach and he asked God to move whatever it was.

01:32.383 --> 01:36.071
"Just take it away." And the next morning when...

01:36.936 --> 01:39.987
...Sylvia reported to Sunrise Hospital there in Las Vegas...

01:40.468 --> 01:43.478
...they did the test and it was gone.

01:43.619 --> 01:47.099
Whatever it was, whether it was a misdiagnosis...

01:47.660 --> 01:56.335
...or whether God had healed Sylvia through Elvis' faith and our faith, I don't know.

01:57.131 --> 02:02.099
But we believed and Elvis believed also that God had brought a miracle through him.
