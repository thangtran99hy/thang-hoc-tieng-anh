00:01.867 --> 00:05.364
And when most people talk about inflation, they're talking about price inflation.

00:05.724 --> 00:10.335
And that's just the general increase in the level of prices for goods and services.

00:10.730 --> 00:12.094
And you probably have a sense of that,...

00:12.201 --> 00:14.765
...that every year, in kind of a normal economy,...

00:14.885 --> 00:18.300
...things seem to get a little bit more expensive, although not everything does.

00:18.630 --> 00:22.425
But especially if you look at something like health care or the cost of education,...

00:22.562 --> 00:26.023
...you definitely see things getting more expensive every year.

00:26.424 --> 00:28.851
But one interesting question is, "How do you measure it?"

00:29.298 --> 00:32.029
How do you measure inflation?

00:32.520 --> 00:34.454
And what the Bureau of Labor Statistics does...

00:34.519 --> 00:36.872
...and this is actually the most used measure of inflation.

00:36.997 --> 00:39.717
They create something called the "Consumer Price Index".

00:40.099 --> 00:43.694
And the way they do it is that they define a basket of goods.

00:44.109 --> 00:46.215
And actually, a basket of goods and services.

00:46.300 --> 00:49.263
So, what they do is they go and look at the average urban consumer,...

00:49.672 --> 00:53.213
...and they say, "What do they need in their life?" They might need some housing.

00:53.627 --> 00:57.627
They might need some fuel, some natural gas for their home.

00:57.757 --> 00:59.649
They need gasoline for their cars.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.530
They needed energy in other ways.

01:01.878 --> 01:03.865
They might need some type of services.

01:04.249 --> 01:06.549
They might need transportation.

01:06.977 --> 01:11.414
And they try to come up with a basket of all the things...

01:11.503 --> 01:15.204
...that the average consumer in an urban environment might need.

01:15.463 --> 01:18.715
And they figure out how much that would cost them in Year one.

01:19.264 --> 01:22.761
And let's say that in Year one that it cost them a hundred dollars.

01:22.958 --> 01:26.449
The actual basket that the CPI constructs would not cost a hundred dollars.

01:26.811 --> 01:28.873
But I'm gonna do this for the sake of simplicity.

01:28.953 --> 01:31.167
And they'll weigh these based on how much, what percentage...

01:31.234 --> 01:33.901
...they think people spent on housing versus fuel versus services...

01:33.976 --> 01:35.054
...versus transportation.
