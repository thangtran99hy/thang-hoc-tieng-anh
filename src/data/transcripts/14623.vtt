00:00.129 --> 00:04.647
Then, they'll look at the same basket each year after that.

00:04.937 --> 00:08.651
So then, they'll do the same things: housing, fuel, services, transportation.

00:09.298 --> 00:13.139
And then, this would be in Year 2 now, Year 2.

00:13.541 --> 00:18.574
And let's say that same basket costs a hundred, 102 dollars.

00:19.001 --> 00:22.179
Well then, they'll say that the general level of price and services...

00:22.254 --> 00:25.337
...for this consumer went up by two dollars or went up by,...

00:25.611 --> 00:29.025
...the more important thing is by the percentage, by two percent.

00:29.206 --> 00:33.146
So based on this measure, based on this basket of goods,...

00:33.541 --> 00:36.008
...prices went up by two percent,...

00:36.234 --> 00:40.330
...or you'll hear people on the news say that the inflation rate went up by two percent.

00:40.937 --> 00:46.501
Now I want to clarify, when inflation, sometimes talks to inflation in the money supplies...

00:46.563 --> 00:49.135
...so people talk about there's just more money being printed.

00:49.573 --> 00:51.950
And often, an increase in the money supply...

00:52.049 --> 00:55.236
...is usually one of the factors that is driving price inflation.

00:55.642 --> 00:59.050
But when most people talk about inflation today, they are talking about price inflation.

00:59.135 --> 01:00.936
They are talking about the increase in prices...

01:01.269 --> 01:05.652
They are not directly talking about the increase in the money supply.

01:05.961 --> 01:07.948
Now, this seems like a pretty simple thing to do.

01:08.045 --> 01:10.244
But it's not as simple as you might first think.

01:10.357 --> 01:15.949
Because think about something like TV sets or especially anything that's technological.

01:16.263 --> 01:19.416
Do you look at the same TV set that's getting probably cheaper every year...

01:19.512 --> 01:22.748
...or do you look at the average TV set that the American household is having?

01:23.077 --> 01:27.426
Do you look at the same computer that's getting significantly cheaper every year,...

01:27.710 --> 01:29.984
...or you look at the average computer every year...

01:30.059 --> 01:32.256
...because then, you would actually be looking at a different product.

01:32.601 --> 01:34.137
So, there is actually a lot of things to think about,...

01:34.204 --> 01:36.034
...a lot of things that, how you could weigh this.

01:36.318 --> 01:41.255
And there's been a lot of controversy and when the weighing changed in different periods of time.

01:41.385 --> 01:44.910
But this is the general idea and it's really just the best attempt...

01:45.010 --> 01:48.723
...to figure out, on average, how much more expensive or how much...

01:49.404 --> 01:52.745
...purchasing power are we losing from one year to the next.
