This will start to bite home in a few week's time...

00:04.247 --> 00:09.375
...when the first shortages start to appear and hit hard even further in about three month's time...

00:09.698 --> 00:13.469
...when the production isn't being made today should've been coming online.

00:13.905 --> 00:19.251
And it's the disruption to the infrastructure isn't it that's key here, particularly electricity?

00:19.350 --> 00:20.970
At the moment that's correct, yes;...

00:21.066 --> 00:23.602
...rather than the factories being destroyed, although there are some.

00:24.032 --> 00:27.577
But these factories need a lot of electricity, a lot of clean water.

00:27.887 --> 00:29.316
And they are constantly operating.

00:29.395 --> 00:34.150
So, any disruption will destroy product that's being made at that particular time.

00:34.235 --> 00:36.349
And that of course will create tremendous shortages.

00:36.432 --> 00:37.682
And which of the components...

00:38.045 --> 00:40.861
...are you specifically looking out which might be vulnerable here?

00:41.131 --> 00:43.871
Well, the industry is very diverse. It makes chips for everything...

00:43.944 --> 00:46.627
...but the memory chips will be certainly the first to be affected...

00:46.736 --> 00:50.183
...because they are the ones which inventories are much leaner on...

00:50.551 --> 00:52.807
...and they're used in just about everything.

00:52.885 --> 00:56.318
So, Apple is rightly to be concerned about these flash memory chips...

00:56.412 --> 00:58.100
...because that is a crucial component for them.

00:58.604 --> 01:00.209
And flash memory chips?

01:00.759 --> 01:04.849
They're used in cameras, your USB sticks.

01:05.023 --> 01:06.590
They're used to take photographs.

01:06.687 --> 01:11.052
They're used to store the data you have on your iPhones, your iPads, you i - anything.

01:11.858 --> 01:12.964
They're the heart of it, really.

01:13.837 --> 01:17.787
Apart from the computing power, this is what actually helps them to store everything.

01:18.022 --> 01:23.093
And for the rest of us as we watch this unfolding, you say that it is going to take several weeks.

01:24.282 --> 01:27.199
Inevitably, are we going to see an impact on prices?

01:27.912 --> 01:29.901
Yes, you will because there will be shortages...

01:29.985 --> 01:35.535
...and that inevitably means that we should be building now parts for the 2nd and 3rd quarter.

01:35.937 --> 01:37.027
Those will be constrained.

01:37.267 --> 01:39.057
And that's the busy start of the season.

01:39.374 --> 01:44.544
So even things like the Christmas TVs and all of those things, they could well be in short supply.

01:45.215 --> 01:48.932
And Malcolm, I know it's difficult at this stage because we're at the early stages of this...

01:49.039 --> 01:56.602
...but are you able to look beyond the Christmas spirit; I mean, is this going to have a significant impact for years?

01:56.703 --> 02:03.450
Yeah, well I think so because before the crisis, the industry was working to a very, very tight, lean schedule,...

02:03.535 --> 02:05.565
...so there was no capacity excess...

02:06.049 --> 02:08.035
...and in fact, a tendency to be under capacity.

02:08.115 --> 02:12.349
So now that this has been taken out, it's gonna squeeze the supply chain even more.

02:12.714 --> 02:15.411
And that will take a long time because if I build a factory today,...

02:15.832 --> 02:17.819
...you won't see the output for 18 months.
