00:02.029 --> 00:07.341
To whom do these companies owe loyalty?

00:07.434 --> 00:08.519
What does loyalty mean?

00:09.149 --> 00:12.861
Well, it turns out that that was a rather naive concept anyway...

00:12.959 --> 00:18.262
...as corporations always owe an obligation to themselves to get large and to get profitable.

00:18.707 --> 00:25.296
In doing this, it tends to be more profitable to the extent it can make other people pay the bills...

00:25.987 --> 00:28.320
...for its impact on society.

00:29.046 --> 00:32.763
There's a terrible word that economists use for this; it's called "externalities".

00:33.181 --> 00:39.453
An externality is the effect of a transaction between two individuals...

00:40.052 --> 00:47.780
...on a third party who has not consented to or played any role in the carrying out of that transaction.

00:48.425 --> 00:51.347
And there are real problems in that area, there's no doubt about it.

00:54.343 --> 00:56.780
Running a business is a tough proposition.

00:57.166 --> 01:00.591
There are costs to be minimized at every turn.

01:01.542 --> 01:06.224
And at some point, the corporation says, "You know, let somebody else deal with that."

01:06.884 --> 01:12.415
Let's let somebody else supply the military power to the Middle East to protect the oil and its source.

01:12.882 --> 01:17.785
Let's let somebody else build the roads that we can drive these automobiles on.

01:18.261 --> 01:21.651
Let's let somebody else have those problems.

01:22.308 --> 01:25.443
And that is where externalities come from;...

01:25.546 --> 01:28.653
...that notion of "let somebody else deal with that."

01:28.945 --> 01:31.041
"I got all I can handle myself."

01:31.560 --> 01:37.068
A corporation is an externalizing machine in the same way a shark is a killing machine.

01:37.759 --> 01:43.567
Each one is designed in a very efficient way to accomplish particular objectives.

01:44.162 --> 01:49.553
In the achievement of those objectives, there isn't any question of malevolence or of will.

01:50.505 --> 01:56.418
The enterprise has within it and the shark has within it those characteristics that enable it to do...

01:56.496 --> 01:58.067
...that for which it was designed.

01:58.863 --> 02:03.549
So, the pressure is on the corporation to deliver results now...

02:04.258 --> 02:11.051
...and to externalize any calls that this unweary or uncaring public will allow it to externalize.
