We are here at the Seaspan Shipyards in North Vancouver,...

00:03.423 --> 00:07.718
...announcing the province's support for the national shipbuilding procurement strategy.

00:08.091 --> 00:11.669
The province has been with us from very much the beginning of this process.

00:12.374 --> 00:18.166
To know that their support wasn't just a slap on the back and an applause.

00:18.975 --> 00:19.982
There's something really there.

00:20.065 --> 00:20.754
There is substance.

00:21.235 --> 00:25.401
This support will be in training credits for apprentices. It's wonderful.

00:25.805 --> 00:28.547
That means it's financial support for Seaspan and the shipyard,...

00:28.940 --> 00:32.468
...but it comes when we go out and hire and bring on new apprentices.

00:32.731 --> 00:34.599
So, it's a win-win both for the employees...

00:34.862 --> 00:37.766
...as well as the province and we're very very thankful.
