Bringing the people behind our food to life.

00:06.610 --> 00:08.499
Marc Gunther from Fortune Magazine.

00:08.829 --> 00:12.886
One reason we have large-scale centralized food in this country...

00:12.966 --> 00:15.575
...is, you alluded to in the beginning, is because it's cheap...

00:15.669 --> 00:19.770
...and a smaller part of our income goes for food than did 20 or 30 years ago.

00:20.331 --> 00:25.653
How do you see factoring in the true environmental and other costs of food into the...

00:26.380 --> 00:28.118
...price of food at the supermarket?

00:28.184 --> 00:30.606
You said farmers and fishermen should be paid more.

00:30.705 --> 00:35.675
I assume those scallops on dayboats are cheaper than farmed salmon.

00:36.648 --> 00:40.119
How do you put those two tensions together?

00:40.929 --> 00:44.259
Yeah, it's a very good question and of course, when we...

00:44.423 --> 00:46.553
...ask that question, and think about it, we have to distinguish...

00:46.753 --> 00:48.567
...the difference between cost and price.

00:49.673 --> 00:51.981
And it's a very important distinction economically because...

00:52.686 --> 00:55.546
...what we have is a low price system and a high cost system.

00:55.785 --> 00:59.747
The costs are expressed in our health care system, in the environment,...

00:59.817 --> 01:02.853
...and the loss of habitat, loss of fisheries, loss of soil,...

01:02.913 --> 01:08.181
...loss of water quality, and those are costs basically that are...

01:09.082 --> 01:11.878
...placed on other people, other generations.

01:12.785 --> 01:15.635
And they're unequally distributed and so...

01:16.103 --> 01:19.379
...we have very, very expensive food in this country. It's just that the prices are cheap.

01:20.326 --> 01:29.455
And so to make that shift from cheap food and high externalized costs...

01:29.591 --> 01:31.848
...that are caused by the production of cheap food...

01:32.384 --> 01:35.307
...and to make that transition again is what this movement is about.

01:37.365 --> 01:41.359
And eating enjoyable, pleasurable, biologically - raised,...

01:41.806 --> 01:44.672
...sustainable food is a lot more interesting than going to the hospital.

01:45.811 --> 01:47.171
And it costs less.

01:47.718 --> 01:51.620
And I don't wanna brag, I don't wanna say but...

01:52.094 --> 01:53.894
...I don't have health care, I don't have a doctor,...

01:54.052 --> 01:57.193
...I'm 64 years old, I've eaten organic food since I was 19.

01:57.731 --> 02:01.863
I have no diseases, I have no amber bottles in my medicine cabinet.

02:02.195 --> 02:04.697
Now, I feel good.

02:05.593 --> 02:09.961
Here's what I'm saying. So, I'm a 44 - year experiment in eating organic food, okay?

02:11.463 --> 02:14.851
And I just feel like, my staff has health insurance.

02:15.007 --> 02:15.538
That's all I want you to know.
