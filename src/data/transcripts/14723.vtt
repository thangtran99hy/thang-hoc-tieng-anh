Welcome to the weekly video podcast for the PBS series "eÂ²".

00:05.009 --> 00:08.669
This exclusive online program will take you beyond the episode you just watched...

00:09.290 --> 00:11.519
...and deeper into the world of sustainable design.

00:21.863 --> 00:25.561
In the same way where the era of cheap fuel is ending,...

00:26.089 --> 00:29.436
...by no coincidence, the era of cheap food is probably ending...

00:29.857 --> 00:33.027
...because this food system is so dependent on fossil fuel.

00:38.951 --> 00:42.863
There are several reasons that we've seen this crisis in food prices worldwide.

00:43.373 --> 00:44.392
The first is ethanol.

00:44.964 --> 00:46.609
The fact is that we made a decision.

00:46.954 --> 00:51.333
Not we; President Bush made a decision in 2006 to make a big bet on ethanol.

00:51.424 --> 00:56.138
And it began subsidizing at $0.51 a gallon and putting a tariff on imported ethanol...

00:56.339 --> 00:58.348
...and the result drove up corn prices.

00:58.931 --> 01:04.113
When you drive up prices of one grain, farmers growing other grains rush to grow the high priced grains.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.029
So suddenly, there wasn't enough wheat or soil.

01:06.498 --> 01:09.424
Suddenly, all grains were in short supply and you have this problem.

01:09.819 --> 01:14.835
I think mixing the food economy and the energy economy as we have is a big mistake.

01:15.473 --> 01:16.326
And that's where we are.

01:16.413 --> 01:24.400
We're in a situation where American SUVs are competing for farmland and grain with people in the developing world.

01:24.553 --> 01:26.859
And you can bet who's winning, it's the SUV.

01:31.233 --> 01:36.434
You can find arguments saying that the subsidization of corn production is environmentally sensible...

01:36.521 --> 01:40.892
...because it leads to ethanol, a supposedly cleaner - burning fuel.

01:41.063 --> 01:49.845
The fact to the matter is ethanol that is made from corn is far less efficient than ethanol that is made from sugarcane.

01:49.992 --> 01:52.430
Sugarcane could be imported.

01:52.619 --> 01:58.547
But the reason why it's not is there is an enormous tariff preventing that sugarcane from coming in to this country.

01:58.957 --> 02:02.989
And complementing that tariff are the subsidies for the corn industries.

02:03.062 --> 02:08.739
So it would make no economic sense whatsoever; the incentives are clearly in the direction of making ethanol from corn...

02:08.821 --> 02:15.317
...which is environmentally far more wasteful than making ethanol from sugarcane.

02:15.845 --> 02:17.921
The other reason that food prices have gone up though...

02:18.731 --> 02:25.444
...is because this food system is so entirely dependent on fossil fuel.

02:25.987 --> 02:28.898
So that when you see the spike in fuel prices that we've had,...

02:29.137 --> 02:31.302
...lo and behold, fertilizer prices go up.

02:32.065 --> 02:33.763
Diesel for your tractor goes up.

02:34.006 --> 02:35.634
The food processing costs go up.

02:35.997 --> 02:40.796
If it takes ten calories of fossil fuel energy to produce one calorie of food energy,...

02:40.903 --> 02:44.930
...well in such a system, oil prices are gonna have a huge impact on the price of food.

02:44.995 --> 02:46.375
And that's the other thing we've seen happen.
