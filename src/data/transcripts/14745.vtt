Bringing the people behind our food to life.

00:05.187 --> 00:10.214
The myth of genetic engineering that's been put out in terms of saying this is the solution to hunger...

00:10.983 --> 00:12.227
...is a totally false myth.

00:12.660 --> 00:14.361
Because the only two applications...

00:14.600 --> 00:19.004
...that have been commercialized in these 20 years of genetic engineering.

00:19.240 --> 00:23.186
One is to make seeds make more resilient to herbicides...

00:23.258 --> 00:25.743
...which means you get to spread more Roundup,...

00:26.037 --> 00:31.065
...you get to spread more glyphosate, and you get to spread more poison.

00:31.754 --> 00:35.097
Not a very desirable trait in farming systems...

00:35.456 --> 00:41.012
... especially since what Monsanto will call weeds are actually alternative sources of food.

00:42.037 --> 00:44.639
For example in India, Monsanto had ads...

00:45.013 --> 00:48.992
...selling Roundup with weeds around a woman's hand saying, "Liberate yourself".

00:50.007 --> 00:55.362
But what Monsanto calls weeds is food for the cattle, it's greens for the family,...

00:55.750 --> 00:56.789
...it's medicinal plants.

00:57.417 --> 01:02.001
And the spraying of Roundup is like an ecocide of the planet destroying diversity.
