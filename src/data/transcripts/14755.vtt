The terrible drought in Texas almost cost a puppy his life.

00:07.654 --> 00:11.655
This little fellow disappeared down a crack in the earth caused by dry weather.

00:11.965 --> 00:15.959
That's when heroes from the Animal Services in suburban Dallas went to work.

00:16.080 --> 00:19.959
They had to be careful to keep the dirt from caving in on top of the puppy.

00:20.045 --> 00:21.397
Oh, listen to his little cries!

00:21.719 --> 00:25.722
After 20 minutes and a lot of whimpering, the dog was pulled free.

00:25.941 --> 00:27.469
I'm so happy to see that.

00:27.535 --> 00:29.486
Nice work by those guys. Nice work!
