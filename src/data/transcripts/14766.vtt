The human mind sees faces everywhere.

00:12.833 --> 00:14.841
They're very important to our societies.

00:15.395 --> 00:17.089
We need to be able to recognize each other,...

00:17.378 --> 00:19.716
...be able to tell who's a stranger, who our friends are.

00:22.227 --> 00:26.016
My background is in psychology, particularly cognitive psychology.

00:26.451 --> 00:29.469
I'm fascinated by the way that the human mind works.

00:29.806 --> 00:33.687
How we can remember information, remember events, remember people.

00:39.112 --> 00:44.059

Cognitive psychologists have discovered that humans don't recognize faces by looking at individual features.

00:54.698 --> 01:01.641

01:03.005 --> 01:06.704
The result of this collaborative project is a new facial compositing system,...

01:06.879 --> 01:12.277
...which is being marketed internationally, which is currently in use by several UK police forces.

01:13.076 --> 01:15.236
'Cause you're always working with a full face,...

01:15.345 --> 01:18.621
...the system produces a good likeness far, far more quickly,...

01:19.384 --> 01:24.789
...leading to a significant increase in the amount of intelligence they can gather about a crime.
