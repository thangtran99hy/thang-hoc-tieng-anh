When you're ready to create content for your first web video,...

00:08.633 --> 00:11.137
...a great place to start is with a 30-second pitch.

00:11.473 --> 00:14.329
A 30-second pitch summarizes your product or service...

00:14.656 --> 00:17.969
...in the amount of time it takes to travel seven floors in an elevator.

00:19.042 --> 00:22.381
It explains who you are, what you do, and how you are different.

00:23.623 --> 00:27.331
Okay, imagine riding in an elevator with your perfect potential client.

00:28.207 --> 00:32.575
What could you say in a few sentences that clearly explains your business in a nutshell?

00:33.506 --> 00:35.137
You might answer these questions.

00:35.824 --> 00:37.579
"What do you do and who do you serve,..."

00:37.732 --> 00:39.049
"...or who is your target market?"

00:39.932 --> 00:41.639
"What problem does your business solve?"

00:42.569 --> 00:43.645
"How are you remarkable?"

00:43.883 --> 00:48.265
In other words, "What makes you different and why should your potential customer care?"

00:49.229 --> 00:52.867
Now, organize that information into a few exciting sentences.

00:53.969 --> 00:57.934
Remember to keep it short, keep it simple, and keep it spicy.
