00:02.341 --> 00:06.067
Well, I appreciate the opportunity you're giving me, Mr. Cromwell, as the single,...

00:06.520 --> 00:08.858
...largest shareholder in Teldar Paper, to speak.

00:11.251 --> 00:13.743
Well, ladies and gentlemen, we're not here to indulge in fantasy,...

00:13.865 --> 00:16.910
...but in political and economic reality.

00:18.588 --> 00:23.738
America, America has become a second-rate power.

00:25.526 --> 00:30.873
Its trade deficit and its fiscal deficit are at nightmare proportions.

00:32.194 --> 00:36.419
Now, in the days of the free market, when our country was a top industrial power,...

00:36.849 --> 00:39.979
...there was accountability to the stockholder.

00:40.687 --> 00:45.961
The Carnegies, the Mellons, the men that built this great industrial empire, made sure of it...

00:46.475 --> 00:49.045
..because it was their money at stake.

00:49.331 --> 00:53.187
Today, management has no stake in the company!

00:54.612 --> 00:59.293
Altogether, these men sitting up here own less than three percent of the company.

00:59.901 --> 01:03.587
And where does Mr. Cromwell put his million - dollar salary?

01:03.887 --> 01:06.854
Not in Teldar stock; he owns less than one percent.

01:07.657 --> 01:08.716
You own the company.

01:09.224 --> 01:11.621
That's right, you, the stockholder.

01:11.778 --> 01:16.060
And you are all being royally screwed over by these, these bureaucrats,...

01:16.406 --> 01:19.285
...with their steak lunches, their hunting and fishing trips,...

01:19.373 --> 01:22.163
... their corporate jets and golden parachutes.

01:22.485 --> 01:23.585
This is an outrage!

01:23.805 --> 01:24.919
You're out of line, Gekko!

01:25.091 --> 01:31.097
Teldar Paper, Mr. Cromwell, Teldar Paper has 33 different vice presidents,...

01:31.334 --> 01:35.217
...each earning over 200,000 dollars a year.

01:36.972 --> 01:40.435
Now, I have spent the last two months analyzing...

01:40.811 --> 01:44.222
...what all these guys do and I still can't figure it out.

01:45.901 --> 01:49.228
One thing I do know is that our paper company lost...

01:49.495 --> 01:53.867
...110 million dollars last year, and I'll bet that half of that was spent...

01:54.117 --> 01:57.438
...in all the paperwork going back and forth between all these vice presidents.

01:59.580 --> 02:06.704
The new law of evolution in corporate America seems to be survival of the unfittest.

02:08.543 --> 02:12.371
Well, in my book, you either do it right or you get eliminated.

02:15.125 --> 02:17.746
In the last seven deals that I've been involved with,...

02:17.892 --> 02:24.966
...there were 2.5 million stockholders who have made a pre - tax profit of 12 billion dollars.

02:26.333 --> 02:26.683
Thank you.

02:29.733 --> 02:32.287
I am not a destroyer of companies.

02:33.009 --> 02:34.624
I am a liberator of them.

02:37.933 --> 02:45.173
The point is, ladies and gentlemen, that greed, for lack of a better word, is good.

02:46.143 --> 02:47.316
Greed is right.

02:48.034 --> 02:49.528
Greed works.

02:50.447 --> 02:57.188
Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of evolutionary spirit.

02:57.369 --> 03:04.231
Greed, in all of its forms: greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge,...

03:04.479 --> 03:08.142
...has marked the upward surge of mankind. And greed,...

03:09.667 --> 03:13.583
...you mark my words, will not only save Teldar Paper,...

03:14.104 --> 03:17.298
...but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA.

03:18.204 --> 03:19.147
Thank you very much.
