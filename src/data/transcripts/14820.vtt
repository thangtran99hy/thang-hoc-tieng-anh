We have some potentially dangerous animals performing here in Milwaukee this weekend.

00:03.440 --> 00:05.983
The Shrine Circus is in town and 12 News Shelby Croft talked...

00:06.051 --> 00:09.483
...with the show's producer about keeping the trainers and the audience safe.

00:13.117 --> 00:17.005
It takes about six hours, five to six hours to do it all.

00:17.581 --> 00:23.537
Elephant pedicures. It's part of the job for trainer Larry Carden. For anyone else, it's a daunting task.

00:23.943 --> 00:26.259
Bow, our big elephant, is 13,000 pounds.

00:26.463 --> 00:27.749
They are gentle giants...

00:27.872 --> 00:32.313
...but circus producer Bill Cunningham explains that they still take great care in working with them.

00:32.815 --> 00:37.477
Just like raising a child or managing a household, routine and consistency is very important.

00:37.589 --> 00:39.568
Same goes for the tigers a few feet away.

00:39.884 --> 00:44.745
While they look cuddly and lovable, it's always kept in mind they are ferocious animals by nature.

00:45.122 --> 00:47.088
They're never left alone even for one second.

00:47.726 --> 00:51.398
The circus has to follow strict rules and regulations when it comes to the animals.

00:51.545 --> 00:54.495
Even the weight of the wires on the tiger cage is monitored.

00:55.129 --> 01:01.723
They are not only subject to federal oversight but local, so we had the USDA in here this morning.

01:02.353 --> 01:05.075
The animals have to be checked frequently by veterinarians.

01:05.263 --> 01:08.341
Their health and state of mind are always taken into consideration.

01:08.846 --> 01:12.805
If an animal isn't fit to perform, they're gonna get the proper care...

01:13.109 --> 01:16.265
...and they're gonna get a day off, you know, just like anybody else.

01:16.683 --> 01:19.266
Bill says an animal's temperament is looked at closely.

01:19.501 --> 01:23.022
New animals are brought in with extreme caution and broken in slowly.

01:23.497 --> 01:27.295
And first of all, the animals need to be comfortable with each other before they're comfortable performing.

01:27.763 --> 01:29.423
This circus has never had a problem.

01:29.699 --> 01:33.790
But anytime a person is working with wild animals, there's going to be a fear factor.

01:34.369 --> 01:37.653
Part of the thrill of the circus is the danger aspect.

01:37.882 --> 01:40.595
In Milwaukee, Shelby Croft, WISN 12 News.
