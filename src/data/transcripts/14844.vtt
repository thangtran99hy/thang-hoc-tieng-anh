00:00.704 --> 00:03.304
Ninety-seven percent of the varieties of vegetables...

00:03.448 --> 00:06.560
...grown at the beginning of the 20th century are now extinct.

00:10.523 --> 00:15.219
Genetic uniformity leads to an increased vulnerability to insects and disease.

00:16.689 --> 00:19.466
Farmers found themselves trapped on a pesticide treadmill.

00:20.296 --> 00:22.685
The more they sprayed, the more they had to spray.

00:24.427 --> 00:28.029
The increased use of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides...

00:28.245 --> 00:32.258
...increased costs, polluted water and created health risks.

00:34.707 --> 00:38.223
Then in the 1970s, Monsanto introduced Roundup.

00:39.438 --> 00:41.600
Because of its ability to kill most weeds,...

00:42.111 --> 00:44.846
...it became one of the most popular herbicides in history.

00:47.063 --> 00:51.467
In the mid-1990s building on technologies that use gene splicing,...

00:51.885 --> 00:55.033
...the Green Revolution turned into the Gene Revolution.

01:01.180 --> 01:03.143
Capitalizing on the new technology,...

01:03.433 --> 01:06.658
...Monsanto genetically modified its seeds to be Roundup ready.

01:12.091 --> 01:14.403
Normally, Roundup kills anything green.

01:15.287 --> 01:19.337
But if the plant is Roundup ready when it is sprayed, it doesn't die.
