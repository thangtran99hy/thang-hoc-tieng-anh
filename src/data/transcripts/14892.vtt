00:07.667 --> 00:12.149
Cleopatra's career as beauty and seductress didn't get off to a great start.

00:12.964 --> 00:17.616
In 51 B.C., aged 18, she became pharaoh of Egypt...

00:18.526 --> 00:22.375
...but she was forced to follow tradition and marry her ten-year-old brother.

00:24.459 --> 00:29.432
She soon got shot of him, but unfortunately her ministers also got shot of her.

00:30.540 --> 00:32.879
In exile, she had no power of her own,...

00:33.327 --> 00:38.613
...so she did what women have done for centuries, used her sexuality to manipulate men.

00:41.359 --> 00:47.509
The man she had to seduce was Caesar, ruler of Rome, world superpower.

00:48.446 --> 00:53.466
She was 21, he was 52. To make a big impression,...

00:54.093 --> 00:57.251
...she had herself rolled up in a carpet and delivered to his feet.

00:57.841 --> 00:58.489
It worked.

00:59.100 --> 01:02.181
The two became lovers and she got back her throne.

01:04.443 --> 01:07.437
But in 44 B.C., Caesar was stabbed to death.

01:08.431 --> 01:14.203
Three men succeeded him; Mark Antony taking charge of Rome's eastern territories.

01:14.479 --> 01:18.939
Cleopatra knew that Mark Antony was a big fan of Bacchus, god of wine,...

01:19.692 --> 01:24.097
...so she went to meet him as Isis, goddess of fertility.

01:26.280 --> 01:29.476
A night of passion followed, a match made in heaven.

01:30.540 --> 01:32.678
It was also a partnership that worked on earth.

01:33.338 --> 01:36.454
He helped her keep Egypt, she bankrolled his empire.

01:38.294 --> 01:40.210
They were happy, but Rome wasn't.

01:41.056 --> 01:43.189
Mark Antony's co-ruler declared war.

01:44.279 --> 01:47.697
The couple's joint forces were no match for the full might of Rome.

01:48.514 --> 01:52.561
So rather than be captured and separated, they chose suicide.

01:55.063 --> 01:58.519
Cleopatra seduced the two most powerful men of her day,...

01:59.380 --> 02:01.382
...but there's no real evidence she was a beauty.

02:01.787 --> 02:04.541
On some official coins, she looks more like a bloke.

02:06.583 --> 02:10.124
We are told she was an excellent pharaoh, loved by her people.

02:10.648 --> 02:15.067
Famed not for her beauty, but for her intelligence, wit and charm.

02:16.935 --> 02:22.640
She used her brains to play men in order to protect her greatest love, Egypt.
