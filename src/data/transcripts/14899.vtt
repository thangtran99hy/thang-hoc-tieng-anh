00:02.623 --> 00:05.581
The tsunami claimed almost 300,000 human lives.

00:06.315 --> 00:10.495
Yet in all the parts of Thailand, Sri Lanka and other areas destroyed by the tsunami,...

00:11.326 --> 00:14.644
...not a single animal that was free to move lost its life.

00:26.574 --> 00:28.829
Was it the approaching tidal wave they sensed...

00:29.321 --> 00:31.730
...or did they feel the sea quake two hours before,...

00:32.309 --> 00:35.201
...with its epicenter hundreds of kilometers away in Indonesia?

00:37.417 --> 00:38.267
How did they do it?

00:39.153 --> 00:44.037
Is it simply instinct or are there physical or even chemical stimuli they respond to?

00:55.499 --> 01:00.657
Phuket island, South Thailand: the tsunami hit the island's western coast at 10 AM.

01:04.167 --> 01:09.119
An earthquake had cracked open the seabed of Indonesia's Sumatra island two hours before.

01:11.729 --> 01:13.230
But as early as 7 AM,...

01:13.631 --> 01:17.667
...something out of the ordinary was happening on the roof of Phuket's Orchid Hotel.

01:18.837 --> 01:22.851
Yes, I heard some noise from the dog on the rooftop.

01:23.513 --> 01:24.357
They put a dog there.

01:24.434 --> 01:25.725
It ran around, I heard it.

01:26.245 --> 01:31.511
And then I was sitting here, heard the earthquake at eight o'clock or something.
