Today, the job of building this nation geographically is completed.

00:08.118 --> 00:10.767
There are no new frontiers within our borders.

00:11.694 --> 00:14.605
So, to what new horizons can we look now?

00:15.551 --> 00:17.389
Where are tomorrow's opportunities?

00:18.256 --> 00:21.221
What's ahead for you? For your children?

00:22.004 --> 00:24.621
The frontiers of the future are not on any man.

00:25.713 --> 00:29.299
They are in the test tubes and laboratories of the great industries.

00:35.620 --> 00:39.413
The Chakrabarty case is one of the great judicial moments in world history.

00:39.991 --> 00:45.040
And the public was totally unaware it was actually happening as the process was being engaged.

00:45.673 --> 00:51.965
General Electric and a Professor Chakrabarty went to the patent office with a little microbe that eats up oil spills.

00:52.558 --> 00:56.513
They said they had modified this microbe in the laboratory and therefore it was an invention.

00:57.273 --> 01:01.709
The patent office of the US government took a look at this "invention" and they said, "No way."

01:02.770 --> 01:04.919
The patent statutes don't cover living things.

01:05.439 --> 01:07.487
This is not an invention; turned down.

01:08.493 --> 01:13.061
Then, General Electric and Dr. Chakrabarty appealed to the US Customs Court of Appeal.

01:13.859 --> 01:18.281
And to everyone's surprise by a three - to - two decision, they overwrote the patent office.

01:22.345 --> 01:27.715
And they said this microbe looks more like a detergent or reagent than a horse or a honey bee.

01:28.299 --> 01:31.109
I laughed because they didn't understand basic biology.

01:31.195 --> 01:32.319
It looked like a chemical to them.

01:32.609 --> 01:39.009
Had it had an antenna or eyes, and wings, or legs; it would never have crossed their table and been patented.

01:39.795 --> 01:41.187
Then the patent office appealed.

01:42.020 --> 01:46.117
And what the public should realize now is the patent office was very clear that you can't patent life.

01:47.910 --> 01:51.680
My organization provided the main amicus curiae brief.

01:52.737 --> 01:55.291
"If you allow the patent on this microbe," we argued,...

01:55.903 --> 01:59.591
"...it means that without any congressional guidance or public discussion,..."

02:00.136 --> 02:02.184
"...corporations will own the blueprints of life."

02:03.727 --> 02:07.945
When they made the decision, we lost by five - to - four and Chief Justice Warren Burger said,...

02:08.035 --> 02:12.071
"Sure, some of these are big issues but we think this is a small decision."

02:12.963 --> 02:16.203
Seven years later, the US patent office issued a one - sentence decree,...

02:17.007 --> 02:21.202
"You can patent anything in the world that's alive, except a full - birthed human being."
