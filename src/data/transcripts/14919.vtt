00:07.752 --> 00:11.879
Back around the turn of the last century, the average farmer could feed six or eight people.

00:14.819 --> 00:19.818
Now, the average American farmer can feed 126 people, okay?

00:20.206 --> 00:22.655
These are the most productive humans that have ever lived.

00:24.941 --> 00:27.695
The changes down on the farm have been momentous...

00:27.769 --> 00:30.724
...and radical, but invisible to most of us 'cause who knows a farmer anymore.

00:32.535 --> 00:36.669
But their way of life has been revolutionized.

01:00.585 --> 01:05.189
10,000 years ago, farmers started saving the best seeds and planting again in the following year.

01:06.304 --> 01:09.151
That's how seeds have been developed. That's how corn was developed from...

01:10.047 --> 01:14.397
...a useless grass for the most part to the extremely productive plant than it is today.

01:15.885 --> 01:19.801
The idea that any corporation could own a food crop, you know, is a very new idea.

01:20.064 --> 01:23.945
And it wasn't until the 1980s that the Supreme Court said, "You could patent life."

01:24.419 --> 01:28.555
And that opened the floodgates, efforts to patent the most valuable parts of life,...

01:28.665 --> 01:31.017
...which is to say the crops on which we depend.

01:32.245 --> 01:33.957
Monsanto was a chemical company.

01:34.970 --> 01:41.228
They produced DDT, Agent Orange in Vietnam, and then they developed a product called "Roundup."

01:43.478 --> 01:47.171
We started hearing rumblings about genetically - engineered soybeans...

01:47.352 --> 01:49.682
...that could resist the application of Roundup.

01:50.543 --> 01:53.283
When the Roundup was sprayed over the top of it, it killed every weed out there...

01:53.593 --> 01:55.321
...except for this Roundup Ready soybean.

02:13.014 --> 02:16.639
I can remember when the first prohibition against seed saving came into being.

02:17.416 --> 02:22.976
Most farmers were just absolutely disgusted with the whole concept.

02:23.841 --> 02:27.545
And it's been interesting over the course of 11 years to watch us go from...

02:28.671 --> 02:33.364
...utter contempt for the notion that we can't save our own seed to acceptance.
