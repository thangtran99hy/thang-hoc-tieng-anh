If you happen to run into your ideal employer or business partner in an elevator...

00:09.975 --> 00:13.913
...or anywhere else for that matter, you'll have about 30 seconds or less to wow them.

00:14.153 --> 00:14.789
Here's how to do it.

00:15.023 --> 00:18.775
You will need: skills or ideas, a list of descriptive phrases,...

00:19.041 --> 00:21.947
...a description of your qualifications and practice.

00:22.465 --> 00:23.603
Optional: a mirror.

00:24.085 --> 00:27.211
Step 1: Brainstorm a list of phrases that describe you...

00:27.483 --> 00:29.652
...and cross off any cliches or catchphrases.

00:30.147 --> 00:32.438
Keep only the most unique and honest statements.

00:32.942 --> 00:37.919
Step 2: Craft a description of qualifications that you can share in 30 seconds or less.

00:38.383 --> 00:39.546
Write the pitch like you speak.

00:39.742 --> 00:42.559
This will make it easier to deliver and make it sound more authentic.

00:43.055 --> 00:45.715
Step 3: Practice your pitch on friends and family.

00:46.013 --> 00:47.813
Ask for feedback and adjust your pitch.

00:48.068 --> 00:50.311
It will become natural by doing it over and over.

00:50.885 --> 00:52.194
Use a mirror to pitch yourself.

00:52.325 --> 00:55.163
If you can't look yourself in the eye, how can you engage someone else?

00:55.500 --> 00:58.517
Step 4: Make your pitch about the needs of your listener.

00:58.706 --> 01:02.410
Talk about the problems facing their industry that you are uniquely positioned to solve.

01:02.679 --> 01:05.883
Step 5: Describe your value in solving these problems.

01:06.305 --> 01:08.595
Step 6: Allow room for dialog.

01:08.807 --> 01:12.768
Most people don't like to be talked at, so be conversational and show an interest in them.

01:13.335 --> 01:14.893
Step 7: Ask for something.

01:15.057 --> 01:18.139
A business card, a phone call or permission to send your resume.

01:18.587 --> 01:20.967
The point of your pitch is to break the ice and generate interest...

01:21.177 --> 01:22.709
...but you need to ask for the next step.

01:23.725 --> 01:24.271
Did you know?

01:24.613 --> 01:27.863
As of 2009, the Taipei Financial Center in Taiwan...

01:28.173 --> 01:32.503
...featured the world's fastest elevator, running at a top speed of 39 miles per hour.
