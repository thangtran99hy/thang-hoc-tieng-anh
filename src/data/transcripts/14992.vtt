00:04.909 --> 00:07.572
I think people find it a controversial and emotional issue...

00:07.937 --> 00:10.031
...because they see media representations...

00:10.103 --> 00:15.103
...of Madonna coming back with a child in a very short space of time.

00:15.718 --> 00:18.253
They think that this is exploiting the children...

00:18.343 --> 00:21.667
...and they see Madonna as being able to buy a child.

00:25.580 --> 00:29.972
Globalization has a direct impact on international adoption.

00:31.673 --> 00:33.931
I think it has a positive impact in that...

00:34.032 --> 00:36.390
...we now have a worldwide community of people...

00:36.605 --> 00:39.624
...who are able to communicate with each other about international adoption.

00:40.226 --> 00:43.667
The negative side is that there is another community of people...

00:43.991 --> 00:47.867
...who could exploit individual children...

00:48.009 --> 00:51.915
...and could be involved in trafficking of children.

00:52.613 --> 00:55.407
We need international regulations to make sure that doesn't happen.

00:57.370 --> 01:00.436
Quantitative information gives a broad overview...

01:00.735 --> 01:04.339
...and looks at international adoption from a statistical point of view.

01:05.325 --> 01:10.424
Qualitative information focuses down on individuals in that...

01:10.525 --> 01:13.821
...research study that are actually at a receiving end.

01:14.544 --> 01:18.593
My interest in research is very much around qualitative research...

01:18.951 --> 01:22.776
...and about looking at structural macro issues...

01:23.137 --> 01:25.885
...and how they impact on individual users and carers.

01:26.988 --> 01:30.184
I think the important thing about qualitative interviews...

01:30.543 --> 01:32.241
...and qualitative research generally,...

01:32.665 --> 01:36.911
...is that it gives meaning to wider policy debate.

01:37.837 --> 01:41.138
People who have been on the receiving end of services...

01:41.365 --> 01:44.459
...should be able to have a say about the services that they've received.
