00:01.531 --> 00:02.267
Testing, one, two.

00:03.635 --> 00:05.180
So with the really amazing things,...

00:05.285 --> 00:07.242
...Angry Birds is now on the web with Chrome...

00:07.719 --> 00:09.176
...and it has a huge explosion.

00:09.630 --> 00:10.189
Exactly.

00:10.335 --> 00:13.002
It's like, a couple of guys, in the middle of nowhere, can actually...

00:13.081 --> 00:13.871
Make an explosion.

00:15.904 --> 00:18.501
...get a game out there to hundreds of millions of fans.

00:18.910 --> 00:21.835
And the number of downloads, it's a simple metric.

00:23.111 --> 00:25.308
If you look at some of the other numbers with...

00:26.701 --> 00:27.627
Mustache is funny.

00:30.025 --> 00:31.029
And that's one thing. Actually,...

00:31.121 --> 00:33.021
...Chrome is a great platform for any developer.

00:33.182 --> 00:34.275
Thanks to "auto updates".

00:36.243 --> 00:38.439
Chrome is a great platform thanks to WebGL.

00:40.617 --> 00:43.442
Chrome has amazing frame rate capabilities.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.113
Frame rate capabilities.

00:47.038 --> 00:48.049
Are you angry, Peter?

00:49.181 --> 00:49.806
You look angry.
