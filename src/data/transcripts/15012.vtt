00:07.544 --> 00:08.947
High school was bad.

00:09.618 --> 00:13.860
I was obviously gay and some kids didn't like that,...

00:14.200 --> 00:15.310
...and I did get harassed.

00:16.591 --> 00:20.736
What I'd love you to take away from it is that however bad it is now, it gets better...

00:21.438 --> 00:23.050
...and it can get great.

00:24.506 --> 00:27.287
And it's important for adults to reach out to kids, and share our stories,...

00:27.550 --> 00:30.752
...so that they can picture futures for themselves that are worth sticking around for.

00:32.549 --> 00:33.345
Okay, little ones.

00:33.950 --> 00:34.947
Here's the first thing that you need to know.

00:35.350 --> 00:38.187
You are perfect and wonderful exactly as you are.

00:38.500 --> 00:38.965
You're not alone.

00:39.150 --> 00:41.359
There are a ton of us out here in this world.

00:41.457 --> 00:42.763
I love you without even knowing you.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.293
It gets better!

00:49.373 --> 00:50.615
There's art to be made.

00:51.313 --> 00:52.444
There are songs to be sung.

00:52.863 --> 00:53.628
So, hold on.

00:54.054 --> 00:54.738
Look at me.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.113
80 years old. It gets better with age.

00:57.418 --> 00:58.312
Listen to me.

00:58.650 --> 00:59.234
It gets better.

00:59.422 --> 00:59.889
It gets better.

01:00.501 --> 01:01.191
It gets better.

01:01.258 --> 01:02.153
It does get better.

01:04.776 --> 01:06.028
So much better.

01:06.450 --> 01:07.767
You'll be fine, partner.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.733
Your life can be amazing,...

01:10.453 --> 01:12.755
...but you have to tough this period of it out...

01:13.000 --> 01:13.747
...and you have to live.
