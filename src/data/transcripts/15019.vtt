Our study is about language acquisition, so we're looking at...

00:06.001 --> 00:09.921
...that very first step, how infants are able to figure out what the words in their language are...

00:10.324 --> 00:12.397
...as opposed necessarily to what those words mean.

00:13.219 --> 00:17.103
So, what we're doing is we've created an artificial language, and it's made up of...

00:17.606 --> 00:20.477
...four what we consider to be words, which each have two syllables...

00:21.017 --> 00:23.061
...and we're looking at a pattern called vowel harmony.

00:23.315 --> 00:25.523
And that means that within that language, within the words...

00:25.928 --> 00:28.830
...the vowels have a shared property or characteristic, so when that...

00:29.071 --> 00:32.394
...property changes and it's a vowel that doesn't fit, it must be a new word.

00:33.277 --> 00:39.161
And so what this is about is trying to see if that cue, vowel harmony, might be something that...

00:39.719 --> 00:43.125
...infants are looking for when they're trying to separate out words in their language.

00:43.287 --> 00:46.387
And we do the study with English - acquiring infants.

00:46.799 --> 00:49.498
English actually is not a language that has vowel harmony in it.

00:49.825 --> 00:51.323
So what's really cool about that is that...

00:52.231 --> 00:55.183
...we see a difference; that infants do pay more attention to...

00:55.647 --> 00:57.861
...what we consider to be words, which are those with vowel harmony,...

00:57.955 --> 01:00.020
...or part - words which don't have the harmony.

01:00.874 --> 01:03.873
We're able to tell that this is something that could be innate,...

01:04.081 --> 01:07.802
...a tool that all infants are born with across the world,...

01:08.121 --> 01:10.541
...since they've never actually been exposed to that pattern before.

01:11.165 --> 01:12.575
So that's kinda what our study is about here.

01:13.113 --> 01:15.257
We used something called the head turn preference procedure...

01:15.684 --> 01:17.927
and what that means is that the infant is seated on their mother's lap.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.179
We're able to see them in our monitoring room...

01:20.664 --> 01:23.436
...and we're playing them sounds and showing them some flashing lights.

01:24.181 --> 01:26.177
After they're exposed to the familiarization stream,...

01:26.250 --> 01:28.749
...where they hear those patterns over and over again,...

01:29.067 --> 01:32.973
...we start playing them one word over and over, or a part - word over and over.

01:33.385 --> 01:36.627
It will come out of one side of the speaker, with a flashing light in that direction,...

01:36.953 --> 01:39.193
...so the infant will turn their head and kind of pay attention to it.

01:39.409 --> 01:42.145
When they grow bored they'll look away,  they don't want to listen to it anymore.

01:42.646 --> 01:43.855
And that's what we're measuring,...

01:43.975 --> 01:45.927
...which sounds they like to listen to more;...

01:46.029 --> 01:49.341
...it's more of a measure of attention than anything else.

01:50.535 --> 01:53.120
Especially at seven months, they do have a fairly short attention span...

01:53.183 --> 01:55.489
...so they're only gonna want to listen to things that they're interested in.

01:55.971 --> 01:58.407
So, by measuring whether they pay more attention...

01:58.473 --> 02:01.123
...to either what we consider to be words or part - words...

02:01.415 --> 02:03.741
...we're able to tell if they make a distinction between the two.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.056
So, what we're looking at is that first step,...

02:07.401 --> 02:10.775
...which is how they are able to separate words when they listen to other people speak.

02:11.008 --> 02:11.139
Okay.

02:11.197 --> 02:14.378
How do they pick out what the words are as opposed to picking somewhere in the middle...

02:14.805 --> 02:15.689
...or anything like that.
