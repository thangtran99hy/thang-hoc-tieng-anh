You know, whenever I teach my workshops...

00:03.433 --> 00:07.540
...on stage fright and how to do seminars and how to get rid of fear of public speaking,...

00:07.918 --> 00:11.651
...inevitably someone asks the question, "What should I do if I'm in front of people..."

00:11.923 --> 00:13.342
"...and I have a panic attack?"

00:16.303 --> 00:21.580
If you have a sudden attack of stage fright, your nervous system is going into stressed out mode.

00:21.941 --> 00:24.642
You need a way to be able to calm down fast.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.853
Here's a little known secret that works every time.

00:29.120 --> 00:34.060
To stop a sudden attack of stage fright, all you have to do is defocus your eyes.

00:34.605 --> 00:37.065
You can learn to talk with your eyes defocused...

00:37.186 --> 00:40.549
...by practicing talking with your hands at the sides of your head...

00:40.618 --> 00:43.291
...and visually, only pay attention to your hands.

00:43.887 --> 00:47.325
After a while, you can easily get used to talking with your eyes defocused.

00:47.416 --> 00:49.313
It's simple and easy to do.

00:50.402 --> 00:54.075
