WEBVTT

00:00.287 --> 00:01.335
This is a laptop.

00:03.766 --> 00:04.776
This is a computer?

00:07.025 --> 00:07.990
This has the web?

00:11.173 --> 00:11.751
That's weird.

00:13.903 --> 00:15.563
Okay. So, it's the web?

00:18.016 --> 00:19.077
There are no programs?

00:21.013 --> 00:22.551
So, there's nothing to start up?

00:26.480 --> 00:28.051
Then, how do I do stuff?

00:32.198 --> 00:33.463
There's no messy desktop?

00:35.519 --> 00:37.260
So, no rolling hills of green?

00:41.094 --> 00:41.994
Can I use it anywhere?

00:46.745 --> 00:47.418
On a unicycle?

00:50.981 --> 00:53.384
My calendars, e-mails, documents,...

00:56.274 --> 00:57.762
...everything can be saved to the web.

01:01.428 --> 01:02.149
That's crazy!

01:03.291 --> 01:04.780
So, I could throw this thing into a river...

01:06.421 --> 01:07.532
...and I won't lose my stuff?

01:10.421 --> 01:11.975
It doesn't need virus protection?

01:13.965 --> 01:15.439
What about annoying updates?

01:19.840 --> 01:20.645
Or patches?

01:21.120 --> 01:22.353
Or patches for the patches?

01:25.023 --> 01:27.135
So, it gets better in real time?

01:30.109 --> 01:31.703
I wonder if people are ready for this.

01:32.372 --> 01:33.676
It's kind of a new thought.
