When people speak, often they'll use what's called filler words such as "ums" and "ahs".

00:15.503 --> 00:20.281
They'll finish one sentence and say "um", then go on to the next one.

00:23.471 --> 00:25.835
Now, this is a habit that you can break with a bit of practice.

00:26.509 --> 00:28.808
I personally still say "ums" and "ahs" occasionally.

00:29.137 --> 00:31.976
Let me tell you right now, I'm nowhere near perfect.

00:33.695 --> 00:36.189
A good way to cure yourself from saying "ums" and "ahs"...

00:36.587 --> 00:41.932
...is that once you say a sentence, you pause, closing your mouth,...

00:43.363 --> 00:44.418
...then go on to the next one.

00:45.472 --> 00:47.755
Remember, it's okay to pause when you speak.

00:48.135 --> 00:52.852
In fact, pausing is a very effective way to give a speech...

00:53.426 --> 00:55.754
...because it gives the audience time to think of what you've just said...

00:56.103 --> 00:59.053
...rather than saying "um" or "ah" in between.

01:00.100 --> 01:01.549
Now, this will take a bit of practice.

01:02.163 --> 01:06.496
But after time, you'll find that the number of "ums" and "ahs" you say will be a lot, lot less.
