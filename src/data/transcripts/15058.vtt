How do you decide if you gave the successful presentation?

00:07.827 --> 00:10.617
Well, these criteria.

00:11.497 --> 00:15.154
Before you ever give a presentation, decide on the purpose.

00:15.717 --> 00:22.961
What is it that you want people to do differently, think differently, or feel differently?

00:23.752 --> 00:28.242
One of those three items should be your purpose, your goal.

00:28.681 --> 00:33.251
And if at the end of your presentation, people are doing, thinking and feeling...

00:33.425 --> 00:40.281
...what you want them to do, think or feel, then that was a successful presentation.

00:41.259 --> 00:47.719
A successful presentation is not measured by the applause, by the nods,...

00:48.231 --> 00:52.997
...by the questions, by the great PowerPoint slides.

00:53.576 --> 01:00.087
A successful presentation is about moving people in the direction that you want them to move.

01:00.911 --> 01:05.765
If you want to be more successful in your presentations,...

01:06.183 --> 01:10.347
...have a look at this site, read the articles and tips, and techniques.

01:10.595 --> 01:15.946
