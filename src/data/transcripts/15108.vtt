His full name is Mymains Stewart Gilligan and we call him Stewie for short,...

00:14.833 --> 00:18.526
...and yes, that does come from Family Guy.

00:18.666 --> 00:22.393
When we first got him, Stewie was just an average - sized Maine Coon kitten.

00:22.500 --> 00:27.625
There was no indication at all that he was going to be as large and as long...

00:27.701 --> 00:29.702
...as he did end up doing after me.

00:29.838 --> 00:33.668
When I take Stewie to the cat shows, normally the position that I carry him in,...

00:33.769 --> 00:38.629
...when I take him to him from the cat show rings, is that stretched out position.

00:38.752 --> 00:40.917
So people really get to see his length. And I've heard,...

00:41.019 --> 00:43.300
..."Oh My God, that's the largest thing I've ever seen!"

00:43.643 --> 00:46.009
Or basically I just get a lot of the,...

00:47.049 --> 00:50.315
...you know, "Wow!" all of that good stuff.

00:50.472 --> 00:55.079
About the 5000th time I heard somebody say, "He's got to be the longest cat I've ever seen",...

00:55.273 --> 00:57.195
...we finally started looking at measuring him...

00:57.276 --> 01:00.047
...to see if he could qualify as a Guinness World Record holder.

01:00.564 --> 01:05.217
So, we watched him grow for a couple of years and throughout the record attempts,...

01:05.300 --> 01:08.513
...and then finally when we got that, that last one, we were overjoyed.

01:08.615 --> 01:13.323
Because we knew that it was over the previous Guinness World Record holder's measurement.
