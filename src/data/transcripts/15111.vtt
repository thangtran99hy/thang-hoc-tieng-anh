00:15.745 --> 00:17.628
Say you've cooked up a new innovation:...

00:17.895 --> 00:19.628
...something you're excited about, some new product...

00:19.720 --> 00:23.831
...or a new service; and you're ready to roll it out. Well, before you do that...

00:23.986 --> 00:27.524
You've got a challenge to face and that is, "How do you explain this thing?"

00:27.889 --> 00:31.079
You know, "What is it? What does it do? Why would anybody want it?"

00:31.383 --> 00:35.012
That's trickier than it sounds because most people don't have the patience to sit through...

00:35.125 --> 00:38.980
...a long explanation and explaining makes for lousy marketing.

00:39.414 --> 00:43.918
So, how do you unveil this innovation without letting all the joy leach out of it?

00:44.129 --> 00:47.813
Well, to explain something new really quickly, one strategy you can use...

00:47.882 --> 00:50.589
...is just to tap into the things that people already know.

00:50.949 --> 00:55.049
So, if I was explaining to you what Netflix is, maybe you've never heard of Netflix,...

00:55.383 --> 00:57.787
...I might say, "Well Netflix is like Blockbuster."

00:58.440 --> 01:00.635
That's not the whole story obviously, but,...

01:00.821 --> 01:03.620
...it gets you into the right mental space really quickly. It tells you,...

01:03.693 --> 01:05.695
..."Okay, this has something to do with movie rentals."

01:06.265 --> 01:07.670
And then I could pile on from there.

01:07.752 --> 01:11.203
I can say, "Well Netflix is like Blockbuster with no late fees."

01:11.545 --> 01:14.076
Or "Netflix is like Blockbuster by mail."

01:14.239 --> 01:18.127
Or "Netflix is like Blockbuster but they actually have the movies you want to rent and stock."

01:18.421 --> 01:19.928
So, Blockbuster is an anchor:...

01:20.027 --> 01:23.488
...it's giving you quick intuition about what this new innovation is.

01:23.904 --> 01:28.236
For a more profound example, think back a hundred - plus years...

01:28.513 --> 01:30.815
...to the dawn of the first automobiles.

01:31.199 --> 01:35.189
So imagine this: imagine you're the person who has to explain what this new gizmo is.

01:35.269 --> 01:38.241
Nobody's ever heard of a car; nobody knows what it is.

01:38.559 --> 01:41.251
How in the world are you gonna explain what this is?

01:41.867 --> 01:45.526
Well, you may know that cars are referred to as horseless carriages...

01:46.262 --> 01:47.641
...and so notice the art of that.

01:47.993 --> 01:49.488
Carriage is the anchor.

01:49.649 --> 01:51.581
Why? Because everybody can visualize a carriage.

01:51.687 --> 01:53.342
Everybody knew what a carriage was...

01:53.692 --> 01:56.963
...and so carriage gives them an entry point into this new innovation.

01:58.015 --> 02:01.592
Now obviously, anchors alone are not enough to solve your problem...

02:01.764 --> 02:03.485
...because anchors create similarity.

02:03.919 --> 02:07.811
"Netflix is like Blockbuster; a car is like a carriage."

02:08.426 --> 02:09.856
But that's not the whole story...

02:09.935 --> 02:13.825
...because the whole point of an innovation is it's new; it's different,...

02:13.980 --> 02:15.356
...there's something different happening.

02:15.506 --> 02:19.573
And so you need an anchor for quick intuition but you also need a twist:...

02:19.901 --> 02:21.954
...some reason that people can get excited.

02:22.187 --> 02:27.307
So, it's not a carriage; it's a horseless carriage, where horseless is the twist.

02:27.425 --> 02:31.939
"Blockbuster and Netflix are similar but Netflix is by mail." That's the twist.

02:32.166 --> 02:37.644
Think about TiVo. TiVo is like a VCR but you can pause and rewind live television.

02:37.876 --> 02:42.127
So you get the point: to sell a new innovation you need an anchor to create understanding...

02:42.355 --> 02:44.937
..and a twist to showcase what's different.

02:45.263 --> 02:46.823
