00:00.068 --> 00:05.378
Other examples having to do with the sequence and the way things play out:...

00:07.414 --> 00:12.322
...a British company decided to sell off a division. They were going to sell it...

00:12.810 --> 00:19.802
...and yet they hoped for a good chunk of cash that they could use to fund higher strategic priorities.

00:20.454 --> 00:24.347
They looked around for natural buyers of this division and it was pretty clear...

00:25.390 --> 00:30.412
...that an Australian company was the most promising candidate, the sort of natural buyer.

00:31.270 --> 00:34.453
So this chief executive of the British firm,...

00:34.686 --> 00:39.593
...who turned out to who have gone to school with the Australian chief executive, got on the phone and...

00:39.851 --> 00:43.904
...said, "We've got this property. It looks like it'd be very helpful to you."

00:44.403 --> 00:48.838
"We're going to be disposing of it and use the funds for higher strategic priorities."

00:49.219 --> 00:50.076
"Are you interested?"

00:50.655 --> 00:56.623
Well, the Australian CEO was interested but said,  "You know, we're terribly busy."

00:57.112 --> 00:59.977
"And to get my people to do this transaction justice,..."

01:00.376 --> 01:03.491
"...we really need a six or an eighth - month exclusive..."

01:03.857 --> 01:05.776
"...and then we can devote the focus to that."

01:06.431 --> 01:12.545
Well, imagine the poor number two to the British chief executive...

01:12.951 --> 01:18.617
...flying off to Sydney with an urgent mandate there to get the maximum price for this new division...

01:19.133 --> 01:23.201
...and suddenly realizing that he had no alternatives and was foreclosed...

01:23.423 --> 01:25.439
...from talking to anybody else for eight months.

01:25.977 --> 01:29.819
Essentially, his no deal option had been inadvertently destroyed.

01:30.358 --> 01:32.658
And as a function of tactics or deal design,...

01:33.253 --> 01:35.925
...he had just managed to mess up his own setup.
