Negotiation is an absolutely key skill. Everybody realizes that...

00:21.058 --> 00:23.595
...when big deals or major disputes are involved.

00:24.008 --> 00:27.592
But negotiation is also critical for dealing internally.

00:28.321 --> 00:32.977
Dealing with people who you really need their wholehearted cooperation.

00:33.486 --> 00:39.117
And you have elements of command; you've got inducements but you need their commitment.

00:39.472 --> 00:42.185
And negotiation is a key managerial tool for that.

00:42.575 --> 00:45.887
Also with the pace of change increasing so quickly,...

00:46.298 --> 00:50.629
...whatever arrangements you've got in place, you really need to be able efficiently...

00:50.751 --> 00:52.830
...to renegotiate new agreements.

00:53.271 --> 00:55.308
And as business globalizes...

00:55.681 --> 00:58.792
...and there's a great diversity of people on the other side of the table:...

00:59.313 --> 01:02.857
...different cultures, different genders, different company styles;...

01:03.537 --> 01:09.603
...your negotiation capacity is even stronger, even more important.
