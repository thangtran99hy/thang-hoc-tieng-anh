00:04.803 --> 00:13.495
Great negotiators always try to create as much value as they can, economic and non - economic.

00:13.904 --> 00:16.497
They try to claim a full share of that value...

00:16.907 --> 00:21.062
...and do so in a way that works for the long term on a sustainable basis.

00:21.731 --> 00:24.492
Creating claim value for the long term...

00:25.103 --> 00:29.632
...really requires acting in what we sometimes call three dimensions.

00:30.009 --> 00:33.433
The most familiar is tactics and good tactics.

00:33.771 --> 00:38.246
Moving from positions to underlying interest, building trust, active listening.

00:38.625 --> 00:40.721
We're familiar with these skills and they're critical.

00:41.295 --> 00:45.225
A second dimension is deal design and that's the art and science...

00:45.569 --> 00:48.193
...of unlocking value from situations.

00:48.545 --> 00:52.485
Whether it's a simple buy - sell agreement, or a more complex trade...

00:52.659 --> 00:56.441
...with contingencies and risk - sharing provisions that has to play out over time,...

00:56.809 --> 00:58.647
...deal design is critical as well.

00:59.495 --> 01:03.212
Less well understood and probably less well acknowledged,...

01:03.489 --> 01:06.958
...except by truly great negotiators, is the importance of setup.

01:07.583 --> 01:10.065
And these are the moves away from the table...

01:10.443 --> 01:15.983
...that makes sure that you've got the right parties, dealing with the right issues...

01:16.653 --> 01:21.853
...having built up the right no deal alternatives or walk away alternatives,...

01:22.225 --> 01:24.545
...in some cases worsening notes of the other side,...

01:25.267 --> 01:29.544
...and orchestrating the process in the most promising possible sequence.

01:29.965 --> 01:37.035
All of those elements; parties, no deal options, sequence and process plan; are key.

01:37.488 --> 01:40.455
Great negotiators act away from the table...

01:40.979 --> 01:44.484
...so that they've got the most promising setup once they're in place.
