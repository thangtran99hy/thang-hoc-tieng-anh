Now, there are many, many different forms of that.

00:02.499 --> 00:07.013
So if we think about the parties, an example I ran into recently.

00:07.408 --> 00:12.058
Involved the board of directors that had chosen a new CEO.

00:12.591 --> 00:17.161
A very private process. They provisionally chose a new CEO,...

00:17.632 --> 00:20.448
...but the deal depended on the compensation package.

00:20.731 --> 00:22.529
So, the board members looked around and said,...

00:22.650 --> 00:25.302
..."Who do we have that's got lots of negotiating experience..."

00:25.607 --> 00:28.171
"...and really has the interest of the company at heart?"

00:28.635 --> 00:30.665
And they focused on the inside general council.

00:31.243 --> 00:34.701
Great experience, very ethical and so...

00:34.928 --> 00:40.865
...the board tasked the general council to go negotiate the compensation package with the CEO candidate.

00:41.653 --> 00:46.943
Now, that negotiation did not go well at all and the question is "Why?"

00:47.505 --> 00:51.449
Well if you think about it, there were a couple of big problems with the setup.

00:51.928 --> 00:55.718
On the other side of the table was a really...

00:56.831 --> 01:02.050
...very well prepared CEO candidate with good advice.

01:02.391 --> 01:08.087
But most importantly as the negotiation progressed, the inside general council...

01:08.483 --> 01:13.801
...realized that at the conclusion of this negotiation, which would almost certainly happen,...

01:15.027 --> 01:20.384
...the CEO candidate would be his boss and so as your first act...

01:20.537 --> 01:25.871
...to grind down your new boss' compensation, it's probably a bad situation.

01:26.292 --> 01:29.401
Now, that was not a problem with tactics or deal design,...

01:29.611 --> 01:31.734
...that's a problem with the wrong party there.

01:32.585 --> 01:35.958
The board should've chosen somebody without that kind of conflict...

01:36.222 --> 01:39.413
...and the wrong agent make is frequently an issue of this kind.
