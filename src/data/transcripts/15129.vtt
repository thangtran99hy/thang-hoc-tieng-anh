00:00.150 --> 00:01.488
And there are many examples of this;...

00:02.187 --> 00:05.277
....I think of perhaps another and then let's pull these things together.

00:06.776 --> 00:18.713
When Volkswagen and the chief executive was really bidding against BMW for Rolls-Royce,...

00:19.391 --> 00:22.495
...the bidding got significant.

00:23.626 --> 00:29.520
Unfortunately the intellectual property, the name Rolls-Royce and some other elements...

00:29.985 --> 00:36.564
...was actually owned by a third party, who wouldn't talk to either Volkswagen or BMW.

00:37.540 --> 00:45.394
Volkswagen CEO did the deal, paid for Rolls-Royce and only then turned to the negotiation...

00:45.671 --> 00:47.187
...with the intellectual property owner...

00:47.320 --> 00:49.939
...who owned the name Rolls-Royce and some key design elements.

00:50.349 --> 00:52.681
Imagine how that negotiation was set up.

00:53.160 --> 00:55.652
If you were re - doing it, you'd reverse the sequence...

00:55.721 --> 00:57.501
...and have a very different kind of deal design.

00:58.101 --> 01:03.563
What I'm suggesting is that in many, many cases, you need to think away from the table.

01:03.699 --> 01:05.219
Have you got the right parties?

01:05.907 --> 01:07.491
How's the no deal options?

01:07.899 --> 01:12.001
Has the sequence and basic process plan been well thought out...

01:12.250 --> 01:16.018
...and put you in an advantageous as opposed to a disadvantageous situation?

01:16.668 --> 01:22.385
So setup, deal design and tactics are all dimensions that you want working for you.

01:22.626 --> 01:24.858
When you're trying to create as much value as you can,...

01:25.352 --> 01:28.007
...end up with a full share of that and do it for the long term.
