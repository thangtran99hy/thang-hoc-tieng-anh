The past. Strangely, there are people today who think life was better back in the days of yore.

00:10.581 --> 00:17.257
But why? Consider Louis Quatorze, the Sun King. Louis chose from 40 dishes every night,...

00:17.383 --> 00:24.051
...taking 498 people to prepare each meal. He was rich because people did things for him,...

00:24.379 --> 00:29.869
...and because others were poor. But today's average person can go into a supermarket...

00:30.027 --> 00:34.139
... and buy a fresh, frozen, tinned, smoked or pre - prepared meal made with...

00:34.319 --> 00:38.683
...beef, chicken, pork, lamb, fish, eggs, potatoes, beans, carrots,...

00:39.043 --> 00:42.193
...or he can choose to eat from scores of nearby restaurants.

00:42.505 --> 00:48.142
Italian, Chinese, Japanese or Indian, each of which has a team of skilled chefs...

00:48.227 --> 00:51.163
...waiting to serve at less than an hour's notice.

00:51.633 --> 00:56.671
Add all of this up and you realize that you have far more than 498 servants...

00:56.919 --> 00:58.249
...at your beck and call.

00:58.697 --> 01:03.578
Of course, these people work for many other people too, but what's the difference?

01:04.033 --> 01:06.755
In a sense, we're all kings now.

01:07.425 --> 01:12.721
Exchange in specialization means you no longer have a wick - trimming footman...

01:13.293 --> 01:16.837
...but a switch that gives you instant light, thanks to hardworking people...

01:16.902 --> 01:19.381
...at the grid of distant nuclear power stations.

01:20.141 --> 01:23.085
You have no woodcutters to bring you logs for a fire.

01:23.571 --> 01:28.322
Instead, you have the operators of gas rigs in Russia bringing you central heating.

01:29.152 --> 01:34.217
This is collective intelligence, where everybody is working for everybody else...

01:34.576 --> 01:36.401
...to bring us whatever we need.

01:37.342 --> 01:40.891
And that's why things are getting better and better for humankind.

01:41.309 --> 01:45.703
So it's time to put the past where it belongs: in the past.

01:46.149 --> 01:49.079
And greet the future with rational optimism.
