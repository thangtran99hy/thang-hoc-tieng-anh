00:00.263 --> 00:00.991
Come on, Sally!

00:01.289 --> 00:02.349
It's time to go to school.

00:02.910 --> 00:03.865
Not for me.

00:04.711 --> 00:05.914
What do you mean not for you?

00:07.129 --> 00:08.884
I went yesterday.

00:09.669 --> 00:13.201
But Mom made a lunch for you and packed it in this new lunch box.

00:14.636 --> 00:16.902
Mom bought me a new lunch box?

00:17.711 --> 00:20.732
Well, if Mom went through all of that trouble...

00:20.960 --> 00:26.448
...and expense of getting me a new lunch box, I better go to school.

00:27.181 --> 00:30.123
But that's the only reason I'm going!

00:31.729 --> 00:33.905
Hurry up Sally, before you change your mind.

00:35.145 --> 00:37.481
I'm coming! I'm coming!

00:40.247 --> 00:42.313
I'll just have to make the best of it.
