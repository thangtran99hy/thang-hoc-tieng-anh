00:02.195 --> 00:05.557
He turned the world of art on its head, time and again.

00:08.790 --> 00:10.886
I think there's no getting away from Picasso.

00:11.164 --> 00:13.602
He managed to transform the whole face of art.

00:16.190 --> 00:18.711
His canvas was his diary.

00:19.503 --> 00:23.187
When you are brought up with someone who has such a personality,...

00:23.381 --> 00:25.800
...you really think that's really quite normal.

00:27.790 --> 00:30.789
His appetite for invention was insatiable,...

00:32.149 --> 00:34.853
...so was his appetite for women.

00:36.410 --> 00:39.963
If my husband did to me what my father did to my mother and Dora,...

00:40.247 --> 00:40.962
...I would have killed him.

00:44.140 --> 00:47.033
The world has never seen anyone quite like him...

00:47.581 --> 00:51.030
...and his innovations have yet to be fully understood.

00:51.923 --> 00:54.403
A true understanding of Picasso is live with what he did,...

00:54.749 --> 00:58.127
...live with his ugliness, live with his barbaric cruelty upon occasion...

00:58.628 --> 01:01.454
...and also live with the fact that it was generosity of his output of his work.
