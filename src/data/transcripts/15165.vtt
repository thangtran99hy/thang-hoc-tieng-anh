00:16.563 --> 00:21.873
Allow me to introduce my mother-in-law, Clara, my wife, Michelle, and my daughter, Sylvia.

00:25.774 --> 00:27.005
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where's the rest?

00:27.363 --> 00:28.231
Never met the quota.

00:28.543 --> 00:29.897
My units are up from last week.

00:30.215 --> 00:31.026
So is quota.

00:39.675 --> 00:42.769
Just once I'd like to wake up with more time on my hand than hours in the day.

00:44.573 --> 00:45.178
How old are you?

00:45.401 --> 00:45.918
28.

00:46.069 --> 00:48.649
I'm 105 but the day comes when you've had enough.

00:48.775 --> 00:51.407
If you had as much time as I have, what would you do with it?

00:51.495 --> 00:52.611
I, sure as hell, wouldn't waste it.

01:09.165 --> 01:12.414
The last time anyone saw him alive there was over a century on that clock.

01:12.527 --> 01:13.713
Well, follow the time.

01:14.257 --> 01:15.581
His name is Will Salas.

01:15.749 --> 01:17.437
You can't hide 100 years in the ghetto.

01:17.630 --> 01:19.301
You know that time will get you killed.

01:19.461 --> 01:20.871
Hey, mom. I'm gonna get outta here.

01:21.101 --> 01:22.932
I just wouldn't know what to do if I lost you.

01:25.009 --> 01:27.376
I don't believe we've had the pleasure of your company before Mr...

01:27.680 --> 01:30.117
Salas. Will Salas.

01:32.488 --> 01:35.869
I'm sorry to have to break up the party, Mr. Weis, I just need a word with your friend.

01:43.918 --> 01:44.793
Please take me home.

01:45.169 --> 01:45.769
I can't do that.

01:45.919 --> 01:46.269
Why?

01:46.362 --> 01:47.301
You're keeping me alive.

01:49.041 --> 01:51.238
How can you live with yourself watching people die right next to you?

01:51.511 --> 01:53.738
You don't watch. You close your eyes.

01:55.829 --> 01:56.647
I'm gonna make them pay.

01:57.309 --> 01:58.723
I'm gonna take them for everything they've got.

01:59.600 --> 02:00.895
Come on! Come on! Help yourselves!

02:00.991 --> 02:01.981
Take the time, it's free!

02:02.757 --> 02:06.071
You put enough time in the wrong hands. You upset the whole system.

02:06.196 --> 02:06.851
Let's hope so.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.739
If this works, we gotta get more.

02:08.924 --> 02:10.215
I can help you get all the time you want.

02:10.307 --> 02:11.311
You know we're coming to get you.

02:16.165 --> 02:16.891
Will, look out!

02:18.568 --> 02:22.403
His crime wasn't taking time, he was giving it away.
