00:09.460 --> 00:10.975
Sometimes, I feel different.

00:13.287 --> 00:14.971
I walk around like everybody else.

00:15.111 --> 00:15.892
Hey, Karen.

00:16.207 --> 00:17.007
Come on, Nathan.

00:18.668 --> 00:19.925
Ready to party!

00:20.075 --> 00:22.497
Yeah!

00:22.711 --> 00:26.327
But inside, I just feel like I'm a stranger in my own life.

00:27.405 --> 00:27.676
Hello?

00:27.782 --> 00:29.822
Nathan, I've got something you need to see.

00:30.257 --> 00:33.411
I found this site that shows you what missing kids might look like today.

00:39.644 --> 00:43.013
Why would my picture end up on a missing person's website?

00:43.495 --> 00:47.414
If this is for real, then who are those people living in your house?

00:49.621 --> 00:50.169
Ms. Harper?

00:50.279 --> 00:50.676
Yes.

00:50.791 --> 00:53.017
We have a couple of questions about your son, Nathan.

00:58.434 --> 00:59.821
Son, go now! Run!

01:02.476 --> 01:04.540
Nathan Price is a high-valued asset.

01:04.985 --> 01:06.683
He escaped an attack last night.

01:06.818 --> 01:09.416
We've got 36 hours to find this kid before they do.

01:09.532 --> 01:11.753
Suddenly, everyone around me is dying.

01:12.747 --> 01:14.103
You've got to get out of here, Nathan.

01:14.219 --> 01:14.654
Who are you?

01:14.747 --> 01:17.051
I'm a friend of your father's, your real father.

01:18.531 --> 01:21.859
I want the video feeds from every security camera. Track his friends.

01:21.961 --> 01:24.249
What's my real name? What's my real name?

01:24.347 --> 01:26.275
Track anyone they've ever spoken to.

01:26.628 --> 01:27.621
Who are these people?

01:27.725 --> 01:28.783
They can't be trusted.

01:29.772 --> 01:33.192
Listen to me, Nathan. We're going to find you.

01:34.627 --> 01:36.004
Not if I find you first.

01:38.680 --> 01:39.025
Wow!

01:44.118 --> 01:48.325
Whoever these people are, whatever they want, I have to stop them.

01:48.919 --> 01:52.678
You have something that belongs to me. Now, it's time to give it back.

01:53.335 --> 01:54.885
What are you planning on doing, Nathan?

01:55.682 --> 01:56.238
Trust me.

02:07.109 --> 02:07.417
Jump!

02:16.871 --> 02:20.301
You wanna play with no rules? You better be careful what you let out of the box.
