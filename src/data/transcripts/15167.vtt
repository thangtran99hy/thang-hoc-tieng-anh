00:00.617 --> 00:04.934
Nothing happened, these kids just sent a mean text about me to everyone.

00:05.447 --> 00:10.508
Something major happened. Everyone at school got this text.

00:10.807 --> 00:12.666
And I'm super embarrassed.

00:13.250 --> 00:17.200
I got the text and it was funny. But I didn't forward it.

00:17.871 --> 00:21.015
I know her. And I totally felt bad for her.

00:21.483 --> 00:23.279
It was supposed to be a joke.

00:23.721 --> 00:25.424
I didn't know she'd be so upset.

00:25.804 --> 00:27.543
I really, really messed up.

00:27.887 --> 00:31.096
I'm not a mean kid but, I did a mean thing.

00:31.988 --> 00:32.899
It's no big deal.

00:33.935 --> 00:35.621
This is a huge deal.

00:36.446 --> 00:38.027
I can't believe this happened to me!

00:38.811 --> 00:40.190
This stuff happens all the time.

00:40.665 --> 00:45.062
I could have said something but then, I might have been next.

00:45.354 --> 00:48.420
I didn't know everyone was gonna send it around.

00:48.687 --> 00:51.763
I had no idea this would get so big.

00:52.454 --> 00:54.073
And I don't know how to fix it.

00:54.985 --> 00:56.510
Cyberbullying is personal.

00:56.937 --> 00:59.964
It's embarrassing, and it's hard for kids to talk about.

01:00.412 --> 01:02.793
Many kids don't even realize the role they play.

01:03.195 --> 01:05.286
And they don't always know how to ask for help.

01:05.979 --> 01:07.165
Here's what you can do:...

01:07.789 --> 01:12.213
...join us. Make a promise now to stand up against bullying behavior...

01:12.379 --> 01:13.591
...instead of standing by.
