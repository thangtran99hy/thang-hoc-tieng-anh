What kinds of jobs did you have since first arriving in the country?

00:16.327 --> 00:20.135
We were gardeners and we were cleaning offices.

00:20.830 --> 00:21.541
You remember that?

00:21.679 --> 00:23.700
We had the night shift cleaning.

00:23.875 --> 00:26.954
That's why you know we had to take you, you and your brother.

00:27.233 --> 00:28.453
I didn't have a babysitter.

00:28.541 --> 00:33.793
I have memories of running into everyone's office and eating candy from their candy dishes.

00:34.214 --> 00:38.675
I remember being with my brother in our pajamas with the little plastic feet.

00:39.013 --> 00:43.459
And I also remember you would always buy us a Cup-O-Noodle from the vending machine...

00:43.710 --> 00:44.034
Right.

00:44.153 --> 00:48.425
...like a snack and then put us to bed on people's office couches.

00:48.825 --> 00:52.223
And then you'd carry us to the car when you guys were done cleaning the offices.

00:52.370 --> 00:53.100
I remember that.

00:53.595 --> 00:57.139
Did they ever know, did your bosses ever know that you took your kids?

00:57.222 --> 00:58.329
No, I don't think so.

01:00.844 --> 01:03.690
Is there anything that you've never told me but want to tell me now?

01:04.726 --> 01:09.766
When we first came here, we went through a lot of things, like not eating.

01:11.354 --> 01:16.181
I guess, for six months your father lost his job and we never told you that.

01:16.318 --> 01:19.300
I do remember a lot of beans, bean tacos.

01:22.837 --> 01:25.050
When you asked us, why the same thing?

01:25.571 --> 01:25.990
Remember? 

01:27.107 --> 01:28.495
I didn't want to tell you why.

01:30.555 --> 01:33.185
If you could do everything again, would you raise me differently?

01:33.815 --> 01:35.619
I would dedicate more time, I guess.

01:35.763 --> 01:40.949
You know, I was so busy going to school too that I guess I neglected you a little bit.

01:41.480 --> 01:41.779
No.

01:42.024 --> 01:48.105
For me, watching you go to school with two kids and trying to make ends meet,...

01:48.353 --> 01:52.449
...that was the biggest inspiration for me to finish college.

01:52.917 --> 01:59.108
I thought there's nothing that could stand in my way that didn't stand in yours, more.

02:00.121 --> 02:03.026
It's the most important thing for me, having gone to college.

02:03.092 --> 02:08.953
And I feel like anything I do from here on out is okay because I've already achieved my dream.

02:09.665 --> 02:11.463
Everything else is icing on the cake.
