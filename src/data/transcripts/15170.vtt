00:04.333 --> 00:09.171
I hid behind a big tree that was knocked down or fallen.

00:10.291 --> 00:16.507
And I could see these Germans in the woods across this big field.

00:17.042 --> 00:25.014
And I saw this young kid crawling up a ditch straight towards my tree.

00:26.412 --> 00:29.838
So, I let him crawl. I didn't fire at him.

00:30.514 --> 00:35.251
But when he got up within three or four foot of me,...

00:35.496 --> 00:39.560
...I screamed at him to surrender.

00:40.240 --> 00:45.725
And instead of surrendering, he started to pull his gun towards me...

00:46.272 --> 00:48.824
...which was instant death for him.

00:50.247 --> 00:58.599
But this young man, he was blonde, blue eyes, fair-skinned, so handsome.

00:58.968 --> 01:03.823
He was like a little angel but I still had to shoot him.

01:05.031 --> 01:08.665
And it didn't bother me the first night...

01:09.206 --> 01:13.533
...because I went to sleep and I was so tired.

01:13.657 --> 01:23.401
But the second night, I woke up crying because that kid was dead.

01:25.791 --> 01:31.615
And to this day, I wake up many nights crying.

01:32.895 --> 01:35.835
I still see him in my dreams.

01:37.294 --> 01:41.702
And I don't know how to get him off my mind.
