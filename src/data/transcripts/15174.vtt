00:08.195 --> 00:11.284
From communion with the dead, to pumpkins and pranks.

00:12.223 --> 00:14.330
Halloween is a patchwork holiday,...

00:14.559 --> 00:20.137
...stitched together with cultural, religious and occult traditions that span centuries.

00:22.855 --> 00:24.347
It all began with the Celts,...

00:24.568 --> 00:28.823
...a people whose culture had spread across Europe more than 2,000 years ago.

00:29.505 --> 00:33.301
October 31st was the day they celebrated the end of the harvest season...

00:33.685 --> 00:35.262
...in a festival called, "Samhain".

00:36.689 --> 00:41.253
That night also marked the Celtic New Year and was considered a time between years:...

00:41.823 --> 00:45.267
...a magical time when the ghosts of the dead walked the Earth.

00:45.741 --> 00:54.140
It was the time when the veil between death and life was supposed to be at its thinnest.

00:58.119 --> 01:01.730
On Samhain, the villagers gathered and lit huge bonfires...

01:01.971 --> 01:06.200
...to drive the dead back to the spirit world and keep them away from the living.

01:07.242 --> 01:10.263
But as the Catholic Church's influence grew in Europe,...

01:10.451 --> 01:12.996
...it frowned on the pagan rituals like Samhain.

01:14.186 --> 01:18.314
In the 7th century, the Vatican began to merge it with the Church - sanctioned holiday.

01:19.439 --> 01:25.158
So November 1st was designated, "All Saints' Day" to honor martyrs and the deceased faithful.

01:26.923 --> 01:33.157
Both of these holidays had to do with the afterlife and about survival after death.

01:34.315 --> 01:40.473
It was a calculated move on the part of the Church to bring more people into the fold.

01:41.847 --> 01:44.307
All Saints' Day was known then as "Hallowmas".

01:45.764 --> 01:47.494
"Hallow" means holy or saintly.

01:48.221 --> 01:51.217
So the translation is roughly, "Mass of the saints".

01:51.796 --> 01:58.905
The night before, October 31st, was All Hallows' Eve which gradually morphed into Halloween.

02:00.306 --> 02:03.879
The holiday came to America with the wave of Irish immigrants...

02:04.071 --> 02:06.537
...during the potato famine of the 1840s.

02:07.591 --> 02:10.349
They brought several of their holiday customs with them,...

02:10.985 --> 02:14.868
...including bobbing for apples and playing tricks on neighbors,...

02:15.589 --> 02:17.795
...like removing gates from the front of houses.

02:19.132 --> 02:22.316
The young pranksters wore masks so they wouldn't be recognized.

02:23.263 --> 02:28.445
But over the years, the tradition of harmless tricks grew into outright vandalism.

02:28.866 --> 02:33.691
Back in the 1930s, it really became a dangerous holiday.

02:34.587 --> 02:40.128
I mean, there was such hooliganism and vandalism.

02:41.180 --> 02:45.146
Trick or treating was originally an extortion deal.

02:46.095 --> 02:49.035
"Give us candy or we'll trash your house."

02:50.148 --> 02:55.000
Storekeepers and neighbors began giving treats or bribes to stop the tricks.

02:55.336 --> 02:58.146
And children were encouraged to travel door to door for treat...

02:58.578 --> 03:00.077
...as an alternative to trouble - making.

03:01.175 --> 03:04.398
By the late 30s, "Trick or treat!" became the holiday greeting.
