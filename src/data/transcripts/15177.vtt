Teachers are essential, are fundamental to build a society,...

00:05.505 --> 00:11.342
...to build a future and to respond to present needs of all types of developments.

00:12.202 --> 00:15.494
So the question is: "Are teachers important?"

00:16.038 --> 00:19.131
The answer is obvious, teachers are essential.

00:20.138 --> 00:25.199
The most complex issue and the most essential aspect...

00:25.721 --> 00:28.241
...is linking the question with the answer.

00:29.305 --> 00:31.414
And this is what we mean by a process.

00:31.561 --> 00:39.709
It's a multidimensional process where we should address all aspects of teachers' development.

00:40.812 --> 00:49.057
Social status of teachers, social conditions of teachers, salaries, training, retraining of teachers.

00:49.491 --> 00:53.245
It's important to understand that when the country has been devastated...

00:53.383 --> 00:59.478
...or struck by a tragedy like an earthquake or flood or war,...

01:00.240 --> 01:06.732
...the first community we have to address to rebuild confidence and hope are the children.

01:07.215 --> 01:11.643
They need to have a psychological support and education is the best way...

01:12.855 --> 01:17.373
...to prove to these children that life is continuing,...

01:17.781 --> 01:21.335
...that life doesn't stop despite the tragedy.

01:22.122 --> 01:27.997
We need teachers who have a psychological capacity to deal with these tragedies...

01:28.143 --> 01:33.348
...and to deal with these psychological challenges especially when you speak to children,...

01:33.449 --> 01:37.167
...when you educate children, when you conduct them for their future.

01:37.529 --> 01:42.705
It's not only transmitting knowledge, but also developing their own capacity...

01:43.475 --> 01:48.785
...to be creative, to be optimistic and to prepare them to be citizens of their...

01:49.532 --> 01:53.749
...community, of their country and of the world in the global dimension.
