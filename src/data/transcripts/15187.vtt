00:00.285 --> 00:02.926
To me, it was all inclusive.

00:03.417 --> 00:04.557
It was Irish to the Irish.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.641
It sounded Scotch to the Scotch.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.183
It was a typical English-American word, it flowed.

00:13.627 --> 00:17.439
"McDonald's." It was easy for the kids to say and remember.

00:17.983 --> 00:20.310
And I like the sound of it.

00:20.606 --> 00:23.993
It sounded wholesome and it sounded genuine.

00:24.353 --> 00:28.438
I don't like these gimmick type names.

00:28.762 --> 00:32.337
Burger this, burger that, and all that kind of stuff.

00:32.739 --> 00:38.393
"McDonald's." It's got a nice sounding name, sounds like "Tiffany's."

00:38.745 --> 00:41.191
And I think we are the "Tiffany's" of  the hamburger business.
