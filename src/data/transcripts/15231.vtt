Damn it! I can't open any of the folders on my desktop.

00:06.746 --> 00:08.234
Hey! You think that's bad?

00:08.578 --> 00:10.011
All of my documents are frozen.

00:11.092 --> 00:11.174
 Yeah!

00:12.449 --> 00:13.038
What was that?

00:14.559 --> 00:15.696
Windows just crashed.

00:16.587 --> 00:18.165
I'll see if anybody else is having problems.

00:19.299 --> 00:20.558
Hey Joe, how you guys doing?

00:21.411 --> 00:27.577
Everything is running really slow.

00:28.268 --> 00:29.610
Hey Stephanie, you having any problems?

00:29.999 --> 00:31.461
I'm locked out!

00:33.793 --> 00:35.340
Bill, can you guys get on the network?

00:36.129 --> 00:37.671
No, we keep getting dropped.

00:38.848 --> 00:40.067
That's it! I'm calling IT.

00:41.483 --> 00:42.243
Hey! We're having...

00:42.339 --> 00:43.825
I know! I know, I'm working on it.

00:43.935 --> 00:44.549
What's going on?

00:44.617 --> 00:46.287
I think it's a problem with the firewall.

00:49.647 --> 00:50.982
Sounds like this might be awhile.

00:51.837 --> 00:53.579
That's it. I'm gonna try restarting.

00:53.773 --> 00:54.804
No! No!

00:58.396 --> 00:58.785
Greg.

01:01.651 --> 01:02.164
What?

01:03.717 --> 01:04.904
My mouse is broken.

01:18.728 --> 01:19.165
I get it.
