Plainclothes police out of a car behind her,...

00:05.163 --> 00:09.171
...and Mrs. Thatcher out onto the doorstep.

00:09.560 --> 00:12.763
On the 4th of May, Margaret Thatcher was elected prime minister...

00:12.908 --> 00:15.233
...with the Commons majority of 43 seats.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.225
On arriving at Downing Street,...

00:17.575 --> 00:21.421
...she made one of the most memorable, if not universally well-received speeches...

00:21.513 --> 00:23.362
...of her prime ministerial career.

00:23.847 --> 00:27.815
It's the greatest honor that can come to any citizen in a democracy.

00:28.355 --> 00:31.433
I know full well the responsibilities that await me...

00:31.734 --> 00:33.878
...as I enter the door of Number 10.

00:34.197 --> 00:39.683
And I'll strive unceasingly to try to fulfill the trust and confidence...

00:39.910 --> 00:43.895
...that the British people have placed in me and the things in which I believe.

00:44.196 --> 00:50.915
And I would just like to remember some words of St. Francis of Assisi, which I think are...

00:51.261 --> 00:54.715
...really just particularly apt at the moment.

00:55.149 --> 00:58.211
"Where there is discord, may we bring harmony."

00:58.615 --> 01:01.439
"Where there is error, may we bring truth."

01:01.781 --> 01:04.583
"Where there is doubt, may we bring faith."

01:04.852 --> 01:07.439
"And where there is despair, may we bring hope."
