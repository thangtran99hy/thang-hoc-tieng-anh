Thanks for coming. Thank You!

00:07.137 --> 00:10.728
Steve Jobs was known to push the boundaries of what gadgets could...

00:10.813 --> 00:13.441
...and, in many people's eyes, should do.

00:14.081 --> 00:15.491
A charismatic showman,...

00:15.684 --> 00:19.074
...Jobs seemed to know what consumers wanted long before they did.

00:19.954 --> 00:23.427
By introducing the first user-friendly personal computer to the masses,...

00:23.828 --> 00:26.239
...he transformed a geeky hobbyist obsession...

00:26.323 --> 00:27.930
...into a pillar of modern life.

00:28.894 --> 00:30.865
The Apple II, conceived in a garage...

00:30.934 --> 00:34.909
...with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and introduced in 1977,...

00:35.375 --> 00:39.419
...sent IBM and others scrambling to get their own PCs to market.

00:40.035 --> 00:45.139
By 1985, faltering sales and competition from Windows PCs...

00:45.611 --> 00:47.913
...forced Jobs from the company he helped found.

00:48.794 --> 00:51.914
During his ten-year hiatus, Jobs led two companies.

00:52.327 --> 00:58.187
NeXT, a computer company that formed the basis for Apple's current software platform, OS X...

00:58.641 --> 01:03.019
...and Pixar, the computer animation studio famous for the "Toy Story" movies.

01:03.885 --> 01:08.089
Jobs maintained two roles upon his return to Apple in 1997:...

01:08.536 --> 01:11.222
...CEO of Pixar and CEO of Apple.

01:11.819 --> 01:14.910
He eventually sold Pixar to Disney for so much stock...

01:15.029 --> 01:17.781
...that he became Disney's largest individual shareholder.

01:18.509 --> 01:21.597
On stage, in his uniform of jeans and a black turtleneck...

01:22.083 --> 01:26.217
...he'd entranced audiences with new Macs, iPhones and iPads.

01:26.961 --> 01:30.535
All of these helped make Apple the largest tech company in the world,...

01:30.838 --> 01:34.853
...surpassing longtime rival Microsoft in May of 2010.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.827
Jobs didn't dream up these inventions.

01:38.273 --> 01:42.067
His genius was in spotting and bringing new technologies to the masses.

01:42.897 --> 01:46.039
In the 1996 PBS series "Triumph of the Nerds",...

01:46.417 --> 01:50.747
...Jobs said Apple has always been shameless about stealing great ideas.

01:51.733 --> 01:54.877
Under Jobs's watch, Apple maintained a level of secrecy...

01:54.965 --> 01:57.869
...that regularly frustrated investors and the media.

01:58.537 --> 02:02.348
But he also led Apple to balloon into the second largest company of any kind...

02:02.419 --> 02:04.444
...in the United States by market value.

02:05.371 --> 02:08.624
Jobs resigned as CEO in August of 2011...

02:08.706 --> 02:11.339
...after several health related leaves of absence,...

02:11.709 --> 02:15.114
...including a liver transplant and treatment for pancreatic cancer.

02:16.056 --> 02:20.252
Steven Paul Jobs is survived by his biological sister Mona Simpson,...

02:20.748 --> 02:25.363
...daughter Lisa Brennan-Jobs, and his wife Laurene Powell, and their three children.

02:25.983 --> 02:27.888
