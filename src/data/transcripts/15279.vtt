She is a symbol for freedom and one of the most recognized figures in the United States.

00:07.804 --> 00:12.344
Located in New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty is a depiction of the Roman goddess of freedom.

00:12.611 --> 00:16.459
Dedicated in a large ceremony on October 28, 1886,...

00:16.554 --> 00:19.403
...the statue's official name is "Liberty Enlightening the World."

00:19.791 --> 00:24.895
Originally a gift from the citizens of France, she was designed by French sculptor Frederic Bartholdi.

00:25.111 --> 00:28.825
However, only her right hand and torch were finished by 1876...

00:28.958 --> 00:31.721
...and both were displayed at the American Centennial Exhibition.

00:32.177 --> 00:35.673
Lady Liberty, as she is often called, is represented wrapped in robes.

00:35.921 --> 00:39.326
In her right hand, she carries a torch meant to symbolize the light of reason.

00:39.602 --> 00:41.527
Her left hand is carrying a book of laws...

00:41.614 --> 00:44.326
...that is marked with the date the Declaration of Independence was signed.

00:44.633 --> 00:49.386
From the base of the statue to the top of the torch, she measures 151 feet in height.

00:49.743 --> 00:53.942
Built on an iron support structure, the Statue of Liberty's skin is made of copper.

00:54.234 --> 00:58.965
Originally the color of copper, by 1900 the statue's exterior had begun to change color...

00:59.238 --> 01:01.662
...and today she is the pale green color we know and love.

01:02.107 --> 01:04.538
The statue's armature was designed by the same man...

01:04.708 --> 01:07.594
...who designed France's Eiffel Tower, Alexandre Gustave Eiffel.

01:07.981 --> 01:11.305
A joint effort of the French, Americans and countless hard workers,...

01:11.417 --> 01:14.637
...the statue was to be built in France and shipped by boat to America.

01:14.981 --> 01:18.637
She was presented to the Americans on Independence Day in 1884.

01:19.067 --> 01:23.367
Tourists were originally open to travel up to Lady Liberty's crown to view the harbor below,...

01:23.760 --> 01:26.300
...as well as making a narrow climb up to the torch.

01:26.591 --> 01:29.784
However, the torch has been closed to visitors since the First World War.

01:30.061 --> 01:34.672
After 2001's terrorist attacks in New York City, the Statue of Liberty and Liberty Island...

01:34.808 --> 01:37.091
...were closed to tourists because of safety concerns.

01:37.365 --> 01:41.109
Finally in 2009, the statue herself was reopened to the public.

01:41.337 --> 01:44.135
Lady Liberty has witnessed well over a century's worth of history...

01:44.307 --> 01:46.951
...and has come to embody the American ideal of freedom.
