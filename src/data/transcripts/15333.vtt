00:00.073 --> 00:02.020
Finally, genetic modification.

00:02.437 --> 00:02.768
Yes.

00:03.215 --> 00:07.721
Some call it Frankenfood, very unpopular in Europe. Why do you think that is?

00:08.517 --> 00:11.181
I was hoping you'd ask me easier questions about GMOs.

00:12.007 --> 00:16.532
I don't know all of the reasons behind it. I suspect some of it was the fact that...

00:17.111 --> 00:21.523
...the release of this technology, going back 20 years ago, got off on the wrong foot.

00:22.537 --> 00:27.475
But we've now been more than 20 years at it. I travel around the world.

00:27.898 --> 00:30.167
I see how much more food you can grow...

00:30.362 --> 00:35.561
...on how much less land, using how much less water, and using how much less inputs,...

00:35.685 --> 00:41.255
...be it fertilizer or chemicals, and I say, "What is the resistance to this technology?"

00:41.363 --> 00:46.982
We have demonstrably taken the world far, far from food insecurity...

00:47.092 --> 00:50.588
...by the proper deployment of these technologies...

00:50.652 --> 00:54.652
...and we've done it with less land, and less water, and less chemicals,...

00:54.718 --> 00:56.753
...and I see those as the big challenges.

00:56.948 --> 00:59.454
"How do we get the most out of every liter of water?"

00:59.517 --> 01:02.702
"And how do we get the most out of every acre of land..."

01:02.766 --> 01:05.757
"...that we can leave the maximum amount to its natural state?"

01:06.243 --> 01:11.051
"What sort of proportion of Cargill's business do you think is trading GMOs?"

01:11.522 --> 01:15.591
Of our own business of the grain that comes across in through our hands...

01:17.203 --> 01:19.349
...given that a number of crops have no GMOs,...

01:19.417 --> 01:22.152
...there's no GMO wheat and things like that, I'm gonna say a third.

01:23.394 --> 01:27.815
And you don't have any fears about GM being found to be problematic years down the line?

01:29.050 --> 01:33.771
No, I don't think that's the reason not to be careful in the way which we introduce new traits...

01:34.145 --> 01:37.418
...in the government and regulatory environment that surrounds them.

01:37.497 --> 01:40.536
But I think the technology and I visit these labs,...

01:40.873 --> 01:46.640
...and I see what they go through. It's basically achieving in a short compression of time...

01:46.801 --> 01:50.609
...what in many cases could probably have been achieved by other breeding methods,...

01:50.735 --> 01:56.183
...but it would have taken 100 years. And so, I think that you can simultaneously...

01:56.310 --> 01:59.695
...be in favor of GMOs and be in favor of strict regulation...

01:59.777 --> 02:03.529
...that gives people the greatest amount of comfort.

02:03.749 --> 02:07.205
One of the concerns that people have about GMOs is that the seeds that are being used...

02:07.284 --> 02:12.175
...by a GM company can spread into other farms.

02:12.847 --> 02:15.805
And then, the company that made the seed...

02:15.889 --> 02:20.502
...will go after the farmers in that neighboring farm and say, "You're using our seed".

02:20.589 --> 02:22.850
Is that something that you've come across and what have you done about it?

02:22.979 --> 02:23.606
I have not.

02:24.313 --> 02:28.791
Clearly, there is the issue of pollen drift and in some cases, even in the US.

02:28.860 --> 02:30.600
It has to be carefully observed.

02:30.761 --> 02:34.991
I am unaware of any genetics company that's ever pursued a farmer for...

02:35.290 --> 02:40.293
...what they call "inadvertent admixture". In other words, through no fault of his own he ends up...

02:40.890 --> 02:45.576
...demonstrating two percent of some traits and the expression for it is "inadvertent."

02:45.681 --> 02:49.190
Now you, the farmer, didn't purposely do it, admixture, which is...

02:50.177 --> 02:53.422
...something drifting across the fence from another property.

02:53.503 --> 02:59.566
I've never seen or heard of a farmer being pursued for inadvertent participation.

02:59.749 --> 03:06.526
So, those farmers who protest that they have been prosecuted for using someone's seeds...

03:06.606 --> 03:10.084
...they've actually, they've probably did use the seeds.

03:10.802 --> 03:14.757
It would be a difficult course for a genetics company to take in.

03:15.357 --> 03:18.921
I would be prepared to wager a lot that it didn't happen.

03:19.259 --> 03:22.369
So, is it possible for someone who's using GMC to actually...

03:23.083 --> 03:25.882
...take it and try and grow crops from it the next year?

03:26.335 --> 03:26.753
Sure.

03:27.291 --> 03:27.923
And that's the problem?

03:28.652 --> 03:29.337
Yeah, purposely.

03:29.828 --> 03:31.523
Yeah, its not inadvertent at all. 

03:32.165 --> 03:33.016
It's very purposeful.
