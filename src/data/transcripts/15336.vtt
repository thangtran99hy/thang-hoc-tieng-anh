00:00.015 --> 00:06.562
So food security becomes the absence of fear of famine and that's got two elements to it.

00:06.646 --> 00:10.573
One of which is economic and the other which is the absence of the calories at all.

00:11.017 --> 00:15.552
Today, we live at a time where the world's at the furthest it's ever been from caloric famine.

00:15.724 --> 00:20.842
The number of calories that the world's farmers are producing per inhabitants of the world is...

00:21.036 --> 00:22.534
...at all-time record levels.

00:23.305 --> 00:27.341
What we do have are issues of economic famine that are more difficult to address;...

00:27.453 --> 00:32.651
...people simply not accessing the calories they need to sustain themselves and the...

00:33.115 --> 00:35.118
...public debate on that tends to get muddied.

00:35.257 --> 00:37.783
And they're two very distinctly different issues.

00:38.211 --> 00:42.040
We sought questions on food security from our listeners and viewers...

00:42.187 --> 00:44.569
...by BBC Business on Facebook and Twitter.

00:44.729 --> 00:48.859
Francis Stewart would like to know what you're doing to help the underdeveloped countries.

00:50.294 --> 00:55.545
So, certainly they've talked about the examples in a place like the Ivory Coast where...

00:55.746 --> 01:01.007
...this year, Ivory Coast and Ghana, we will buy from more than 250,000 farmers.

01:01.114 --> 01:06.352
We will conduct training classes for more than 60,000 on how to grow their crops,...

01:06.839 --> 01:11.723
...how to harvest them, how to maintain them post - harvest to avoid wastage;...

01:12.099 --> 01:15.778
...how to improve the quality which raises the price we can pay them...

01:15.909 --> 01:19.047
...for the beans that they produce which raises their family incomes.

01:19.151 --> 01:21.429
We talked about Zimbabwe and the fact that...

01:22.155 --> 01:24.297
...we will make between Zimbabwe and Zambia...

01:24.382 --> 01:27.965
...this year almost 140,000 microloans to farmers,...

01:28.060 --> 01:33.475
...in those countries, in exchange for them producing their crops to the...

01:33.794 --> 01:37.255
...standards and to the practices that we have taught to them.

01:37.368 --> 01:41.675
And so there is a quid pro quo: they get more money for their products.

01:41.935 --> 01:47.345
We provide the microloans, and they in turn comply with what we feel are best practices.

01:47.677 --> 01:51.036
And so I could go on. I think the biggest thing that we do...

01:51.495 --> 01:54.574
...is to be a voice for trust - based free trade in food.

01:54.875 --> 01:59.401
And if you think about the world, all natural resources weren't equally spread and so...

01:59.583 --> 02:01.840
...each part of the world has comparative advantage.

02:02.316 --> 02:06.148
And we have tried to be a voice to raise the right crops in the right places...

02:06.257 --> 02:08.987
...using the right technology and then to trade with each other.

02:09.471 --> 02:12.337
And we think, "If the world's going to be food secure..."

02:12.425 --> 02:15.521
"...and if it's going to do it at prices that people can afford to pay,..."

02:15.931 --> 02:18.839
"...this trust - based free trade is really critical."

02:19.110 --> 02:23.093
Andrew Reitmeyer asked, "When making land acquisitions in developing countries,..."

02:23.333 --> 02:25.867
"...what is done to protect the environment and rights of people..."

02:26.160 --> 02:28.059
"...who depend on that land to survive?"

02:28.547 --> 02:34.495
So first of all, we are not land owners; we are the processors of people's crops...

02:34.575 --> 02:38.671
...and so we need farmers to be successful, we need consumers to be successful.

02:38.769 --> 02:44.989
And we need to bring technology and finance, and engineering expertise.

02:45.490 --> 02:49.662
So to the question about land ownership,...

02:51.302 --> 02:54.769
...no company is big enough to be a police force onto itself.

02:54.873 --> 02:59.953
And I think the World Wildlife Fund has a great expression which is,...

03:00.047 --> 03:01.653
..."The world should agree on the nots."

03:02.171 --> 03:08.568
We're not going to do certain things in Yellowstone National Park and across the world;...

03:08.692 --> 03:13.143
...what we need and by the we, society as a whole needs to decide,...

03:13.210 --> 03:14.875
..."What are the things we're not gonna do?"

03:15.274 --> 03:17.487
And then agriculture needs to respond to that...

03:17.622 --> 03:21.792
...and grow the calories that we need in those places where agriculture is permissible.
