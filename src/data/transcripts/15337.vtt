Having large concentrations of capital coming into an area...

00:06.938 --> 00:11.115
...and bringing best practices is the quickest way to raise more food.

00:11.428 --> 00:14.406
Is it the best way from a long-term sociology standpoint?

00:14.517 --> 00:17.678
I think that's a much more difficult question to answer.

00:18.248 --> 00:21.508
If you look at it today, there are two things I think your audience should understand.

00:21.582 --> 00:25.621
One, 85% of all food calories are consumed in the country where they're grown.

00:25.983 --> 00:28.597
So the food business is a very local business.

00:29.145 --> 00:32.552
Those 15% of calories that trade across boundaries,...

00:32.713 --> 00:36.556
...and where Cargill plays an important role, are critical to certain countries...

00:36.665 --> 00:39.878
...that are not endowed with water resources or land resources.

00:39.975 --> 00:42.931
But the food business at its core is very local.

00:43.429 --> 00:48.106
And so in that context, the way in which land ownership has evolved...

00:48.196 --> 00:51.114
...and will evolve is going to be a big and important question.

00:51.673 --> 00:54.446
At the same time the percent of the world's food that's raised...

00:54.563 --> 00:58.323
...on enormous tracts of land, 'de minimis'.
