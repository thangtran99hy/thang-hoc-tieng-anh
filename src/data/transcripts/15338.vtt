What's interesting to me today is the biggest subsidies in agriculture in terms of price - distorting subsidies...

00:07.044 --> 00:12.813
...are in primarily Third World countries or Middle World countries.

00:13.212 --> 00:17.983
In some cases, the countries that benefited most from Norman Borlaug's green revolution...

00:18.061 --> 00:21.492
...were those that gave income security to their farmers,...

00:21.567 --> 00:23.511
...which encouraged them to go out and deploy it.

00:23.635 --> 00:27.408
And so I think one of the things that's misunderstood is the presumption...

00:27.520 --> 00:35.070
...that the US and Western Europe are at this very moment the world's largest subsidizers of agriculture.

00:35.157 --> 00:38.780
In point of fact, it's not the case. It's the other way around of people...

00:38.869 --> 00:44.219
...with small-scale agriculture giving price support to their growers...

00:44.299 --> 00:47.162
...in order to encourage real income distribution.

00:47.513 --> 00:52.821
Countries like China that have an incentive to keep people employed in agriculture,...

00:52.908 --> 00:55.209
...have subsidized their agriculture heavily.

00:55.643 --> 00:56.491
India, the same.

00:56.644 --> 00:57.611
Mexico, the same.

00:58.051 --> 00:58.657
Zambia.

00:59.213 --> 01:05.431
And so there are a lot of countries out there that in the name of rural income support...

01:05.852 --> 01:10.919
...have put subsidization programs in place to achieve broader social purposes.

01:11.100 --> 01:14.613
And so I think subsidies are something that are misunderstood...

01:14.679 --> 01:16.454
...the way in which they are being utilized today.
