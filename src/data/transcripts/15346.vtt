00:05.641 --> 00:06.872
Steve Jobs is a genius.

00:06.982 --> 00:09.935
I think what Apple has done is just genius.

00:10.081 --> 00:11.919
Who is your idol in business?

00:12.128 --> 00:13.557
I think Steve Jobs.

00:13.927 --> 00:16.704
He made his own company, got kicked out of it, made a new company,...

00:16.767 --> 00:18.461
...got brought back into his old company.

00:18.571 --> 00:20.289
He's a superstar.

00:20.421 --> 00:23.057
Apple's leading the market in sort of showing the market where to go.

00:23.204 --> 00:24.876
I want to build a tablet, and everyone's following.

00:24.949 --> 00:28.788
The iPad was the most successful technology launch in history.

00:29.287 --> 00:33.011
The iPad 2: you're seeing it, it's more popular than the iPad 1.

00:33.101 --> 00:37.860
I remember growing up when I was younger and my dad had a deal with Apple.

00:39.761 --> 00:43.011
And I thought that was the coolest thing ever because for a long time,...

00:43.520 --> 00:47.153
...everyone was using the PC and then Macintosh came back out...

00:47.318 --> 00:48.394
...and came back strong.

00:48.501 --> 00:49.811
And that's when my dad started his deal.

00:50.736 --> 00:54.436
And I just remember thinking, "Oh I'm gonna get all of these great Apple products."

00:54.539 --> 00:57.455
"I'm gonna have everything!" and then I did not get one thing.

00:57.816 --> 01:02.754
But now, I have the iPads and my iPhones, and all we use is Apple at my house.

01:02.814 --> 01:04.523
So, it's been a great product. I love it.

01:04.618 --> 01:10.009
Now, there's a difference between convincing someone to buy a laptop for that one transaction.

01:10.363 --> 01:14.338
It's quite different to enchant that person with the totality of your company...

01:14.702 --> 01:20.173
...so that you buy a laptop, and then you buy an iPhone, an iPod, an iPad and iTunes.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.761
Apple has done the Is.

01:22.421 --> 01:30.705
So and then you stand in line, in the cold weather for 24 hours to get the first iPhone 5.0 or whatever.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.197
Apple in particular has enchanted its customers.

01:34.237 --> 01:36.175
A lot of times people think they're crazy.

01:36.950 --> 01:38.940
But in that craziness, we see genius.

01:39.280 --> 01:41.013
And those are the people we're making tools for.

01:41.030 --> 01:44.777
You had Bill Gates and his team, Paul Allen.

01:45.181 --> 01:48.007
They did this whole thing: this whole IBM,...

01:50.316 --> 01:53.453
...that sort of whole computer thing; it was thriving doing its thing.

01:53.565 --> 01:54.297
So what do you do?

01:54.621 --> 01:58.281
If you're gonna enter this foray and that became the business computer,...

01:58.949 --> 02:00.967
...what do you do if you're hitting in the market place?

02:02.001 --> 02:03.333
What are the cool people buying?

02:03.423 --> 02:05.290
And do the cool people want a different option?

02:05.686 --> 02:12.143
So let me target the entertainment guys; let me target the other people with this cool, slick,...

02:12.519 --> 02:14.977
...sexy, interesting - looking computer...

02:15.258 --> 02:19.219
...that focuses on music, it focuses on film, it focuses on photography.

02:19.527 --> 02:25.503
And it's really the ease of use; it's just incredible like a five - year - old could use it.

02:26.133 --> 02:27.109
"Let me do that."

02:27.203 --> 02:29.735
"Let me bring you the sleek, cool."

02:29.880 --> 02:32.049
Monumental, what they did.

02:32.103 --> 02:38.223
It's in Apple's DNA that technology alone is not enough.

02:38.517 --> 02:43.393
That it's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities...

02:43.953 --> 02:48.599
...that yields us the result that makes our hearts sing.

02:48.749 --> 02:54.408
I just think what that company has done for the creation of value is one of the greatest stories out there.

02:54.563 --> 02:58.149
To me, one of the interesting things about that company is that...

02:59.057 --> 03:01.586
...pretty much all young people today are familiar with that technology.

03:02.094 --> 03:09.087
Someday those people are gonna be CIOs, CFOs; heads of departments, heads of functions.

03:09.556 --> 03:13.273
And with the familiarity they have with that technology, you'd have to believe that...

03:13.420 --> 03:15.574
...even though it's a consumer-facing company today,...

03:16.101 --> 03:22.401
...they're gonna have a huge opportunity someday to help businesses do better where they don't really play today.
