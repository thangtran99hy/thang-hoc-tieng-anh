Even today, there are those who are trying to silence our words.

00:05.173 --> 00:12.836
But the voices of this conference and of the women at Huairou must be heard loudly and clearly.

00:13.639 --> 00:19.931
It is a violation of human rights when babies are denied food...

00:20.039 --> 00:27.354
...or drowned or suffocated or their spines broken simply because they are born girls.

00:38.440 --> 00:47.501
It is a violation of human rights when women and girls are sold into the slavery of prostitution...

00:47.591 --> 00:55.839
...for human greed and the kinds of reasons that are used to justify this practice should no longer be tolerated.

01:03.835 --> 01:09.205
It is a violation of human rights when women are doused with gasoline,...

01:09.329 --> 01:15.143
...set on fire and burned to death because their marriage dowries are deemed too small.

01:21.085 --> 01:27.285
It is a violation of human rights when individual women are raped in their own communities...

01:27.369 --> 01:34.243
...and when thousands of women are subjected to rape as a tactic or prize of war.

01:39.835 --> 01:45.803
It is a violation of human rights when a leading cause of death worldwide...

01:45.907 --> 01:52.287
...among women ages 14 to 44 is the violence they are subjected to...

01:52.391 --> 01:55.687
...in their own homes by their own relatives.

02:01.656 --> 02:07.228
It is a violation of human rights when young girls are brutalized...

02:07.344 --> 02:11.502
...by the painful and degrading practice of genital mutilation.

02:17.431 --> 02:21.951
It is a violation of human rights when women are denied...

02:22.062 --> 02:26.699
...the right to plan their own families and that includes...

02:27.042 --> 02:31.935
...being forced to have abortions or being sterilized against their will.

02:40.912 --> 02:48.194
If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights...

02:48.326 --> 02:54.533
...are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all.
