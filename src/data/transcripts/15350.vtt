Steve, I've never met you but I followed your whole life and career.

00:08.220 --> 00:11.372
And out of everything you've done, what I found most inspiring...

00:11.451 --> 00:15.104
...was the commencement speech that you gave at Stanford in 2005...

00:15.679 --> 00:18.264
...where you shared lots of lessons that you've learned throughout your life.

00:18.747 --> 00:22.043
And the one I remembered most is your final lesson around following your heart.

00:22.154 --> 00:26.609
Your time is limited so don't waste it living someone else's life.

00:27.440 --> 00:29.769
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.

00:30.402 --> 00:33.843
They somehow already know what you truly want to become.

00:36.855 --> 00:39.430
Steve's legacy is gonna live for a very long time.

00:40.355 --> 00:43.729
The stories are pronounced around his innovation;...

00:44.107 --> 00:47.117
...not just innovation on technology but on business models...

00:47.791 --> 00:52.839
...and in creating a culture of sustainable innovation which we certainly see at Apple,...

00:52.927 --> 00:56.011
...something we try to embody here at EMC.

00:58.939 --> 01:03.374
What can you say about a man that has literally created industries...

01:03.445 --> 01:06.102
...and changed the world; he really has.

01:06.945 --> 01:09.178
He's been such an inspiration to millions of people.
