You've just seen some pictures of Macintosh.

00:06.452 --> 00:08.247
Now, I'd like to show you Macintosh in person.

00:19.277 --> 00:22.146
I think the way out is not to slash and burn, it's to innovate.

00:22.605 --> 00:26.071
That's how Apple got to its glory and I think that's how Apple could return to it.

00:26.591 --> 00:27.358
There it is right there.

00:30.559 --> 00:34.013
This amazing little device holds 1,000 songs.

00:34.517 --> 00:37.995
Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone.

00:38.831 --> 00:40.860
The iPad, Macbook Air.

00:41.501 --> 00:45.722
One is very fortunate if you get to work on just one of these in your career.

00:48.226 --> 00:49.772
Apple has been very fortunate.

00:50.565 --> 00:54.554
It's been able to introduce a few of these into the world.

00:54.827 --> 00:57.901
I think if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then...

00:58.157 --> 00:59.614
...you should go do something else wonderful.

01:00.831 --> 01:03.595
Not dwell on it for too long, just figure out what's next.

01:03.806 --> 01:07.381
It's a lot of hard work and it's a lot of worrying constantly.

01:07.857 --> 01:12.329
And if you don't love it, you're gonna fail.

01:12.569 --> 01:14.195
So you gotta love it, you gotta have passion.

01:14.463 --> 01:19.010
We're gonna take the heat 'cause we wanna make the best product in the world for customers.

01:19.358 --> 01:22.104
We're gonna instead focus our energy on these technologies,...

01:22.249 --> 01:24.467
...which we think are in their ascendancy and we think we're gonna be...

01:24.827 --> 01:26.596
...the right technologies for customers.

01:26.685 --> 01:27.545
And you know what,...

01:27.899 --> 01:30.078
...they're paying us to make those choices.

01:30.709 --> 01:33.314
That's what a lot of customers pay us to do.

01:33.899 --> 01:38.134
Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking.

01:39.063 --> 01:42.550
Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.

01:43.255 --> 01:46.811
And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.

01:47.510 --> 01:50.873
They somehow already know what you truly want to become.

01:51.697 --> 01:53.831
Everything else is secondary.
