00:00.781 --> 00:04.655
These wind turbines may look like serene sentinels on the horizon,...

00:04.927 --> 00:08.626
...calmly overseeing vast swaths of land or water,...

00:08.947 --> 00:12.225
...but don't underestimate their power or promise.

00:12.441 --> 00:15.873
You can't see it or hold it, but scientists estimate...

00:15.989 --> 00:18.447
...that the invisible energy source we call the wind...

00:18.745 --> 00:23.377
...has the potential to supply the world's electricity five times over.

00:23.633 --> 00:28.138
And do so while producing almost no greenhouse gas emissions.

00:28.469 --> 00:32.817
Yet today, we get less than two percent of our electricity from wind power.

00:33.179 --> 00:33.717
Why?

00:34.159 --> 00:37.979
One reason is that wind powered electricity from large commercial wind farms...

00:38.054 --> 00:39.791
...is a relatively new idea.

00:40.154 --> 00:43.455
The wind turbine is still a young technology with high costs.

00:43.781 --> 00:47.299
But those costs are falling as more and more turbines get built.

00:47.693 --> 00:51.178
And here in the US, that's primarily in the giant windbelt...

00:51.481 --> 00:54.409
...that stretches from Texas to Montana and North Dakota.

00:54.735 --> 00:57.775
But the location of that windbelt brings up another challenge.

00:58.101 --> 01:02.874
It's located far from either coast. To better harness and utilize this source of energy,...

01:03.143 --> 01:06.518
...new transmission lines would have to be built to connect the windbelt...

01:06.758 --> 01:10.092
...to more populated areas to the east and to the west.

01:10.859 --> 01:13.341
In addition, the wind doesn't blow all the time.

01:13.650 --> 01:18.551
That means either a backup source of energy is needed or we need a way to store wind power...

01:18.893 --> 01:21.569
...and make it available when there's no wind blowing.

01:22.124 --> 01:26.065
None of that is cheap, so while the cost of wind turbines are dropping,...

01:26.384 --> 01:29.530
...the problems with the wind's intermittency, remote location...

01:29.812 --> 01:32.731
...and an insufficient energy grid will need to be resolved...

01:32.843 --> 01:35.123
...before this clean and renewable kind of energy...

01:35.491 --> 01:39.294
...becomes truly competitive with more traditional sources of electricity.

01:39.548 --> 01:41.969
