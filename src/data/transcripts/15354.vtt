An increasingly popular technique in new product development...

00:08.309 --> 00:10.546
...is what has come to be known as "ethnography".

00:10.933 --> 00:14.765
A term that grew out of the field of anthropology...

00:15.139 --> 00:21.054
..and it's just an academic-sounding word for observational research.

00:21.943 --> 00:27.752
Why do it? Well, I think the notion is that sometimes there's a huge departure...

00:28.103 --> 00:32.009
...between what people say they do versus what they actually do.

00:32.417 --> 00:36.665
And the only way we would know this, of course, is through observation.

00:37.520 --> 00:41.299
Another problem is that there are some needs that we refer to as unarticulated needs.

00:41.389 --> 00:43.595
There are things the customer doesn't even think about,...

00:44.051 --> 00:47.816
...and in a straight conversational interview, might never bring up.

00:48.617 --> 00:51.836
I'll give a couple of examples of that. We were, many years ago,...

00:52.547 --> 00:57.262
...working with a division of Baxter on a new dialysis machine.

00:57.771 --> 01:02.727
And one of the things that no customer ever brought up but which we observed is...

01:03.054 --> 01:07.621
...that during a dialysis treatment, the nurses have to be writing a lot of things down.

01:07.986 --> 01:11.445
And they seem to be going ridiculous distances across the clinic...

01:11.753 --> 01:15.635
...just to find a flat surface on which to write something down.

01:16.469 --> 01:20.239
Nobody ever brought it up, but we observed it time and time again.

01:20.731 --> 01:26.967
And what my client ultimately did was they put a flat shelf on top of the machine...

01:27.080 --> 01:31.695
...that was just incredibly popular, even though it had been totally unarticulated.

01:31.813 --> 01:36.163
Now, of course, once you've brought it up with people, yeah, they recognized it immediately.

01:36.253 --> 01:40.285
"Yeah, I always go all the way over to the nurses station just to write something down."

01:42.072 --> 01:46.701
There's also, again, this disconnect between what they do and what they say they do.
