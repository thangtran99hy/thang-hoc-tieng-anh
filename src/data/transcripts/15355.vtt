We were doing something on auto painting.

00:02.160 --> 00:09.088
And companies, it turns out the process of color matching is actually non - trivial; it's a very...

00:09.459 --> 00:10.834
...complicated thing to do.

00:11.175 --> 00:17.525
And all of the paint manufacturers have a very rigorous, specific way;...

00:18.081 --> 00:21.615
...a set of steps that you're supposed to go through to get a perfect match.

00:21.713 --> 00:24.661
Well, when we got out there and started watching guys painting cars,...

00:24.978 --> 00:28.405
...what we saw was they weren't paying any attention to all those steps at all.

00:28.491 --> 00:33.390
They were taking every shortcut in the book, figuring they could get it close enough.

00:33.559 --> 00:37.028
Why do they do that? Well, most of them are paid based on piecework.

00:37.146 --> 00:41.530
So, faster is better and close enough is good enough...

00:41.789 --> 00:44.729
...and our client was totally unaware of this.

00:46.781 --> 00:51.739
There's a big disconnect that you could only learn sometimes through observational techniques.

00:51.809 --> 00:55.263
Now, there are a lot of pros and a lot of cons to ethnography.

00:56.065 --> 01:01.041
One of the difficulties is that the interviews are very costly and very time - consuming.

01:01.518 --> 01:05.645
And as a result, it's impossible to get the kind of sample size...

01:06.024 --> 01:08.936
...that many product developers feel they need to do...

01:10.490 --> 01:14.032
...a good voice of the customer or a good discovery study.

01:14.506 --> 01:18.493
So, they tend to rely on relatively small sample sizes.

01:19.579 --> 01:24.365
The other big problem that everybody contends with is the issue that has come to be known as...

01:24.676 --> 01:25.969
...the Hawthorne effect.

01:26.892 --> 01:32.306
And in a nutshell what that is, is the notion that observation alters behavior.

01:32.607 --> 01:35.531
For instance, you would see this all the time in a construction site...

01:35.871 --> 01:40.392
...where when the workers know that they're being observed, everybody is going exactly by the book.

01:40.524 --> 01:43.673
They're wearing their hard hat and following all the safety rules.

01:43.946 --> 01:46.729
And the minute the observers go away, they go back to,...

01:47.017 --> 01:51.857
..."sometimes we wear the hard hat, sometimes we don't, sometimes we saw a board over our knee"...

01:51.967 --> 01:55.045
...which is a real no no; it's a great way to cut into your leg.

01:56.164 --> 02:00.832
And so, it's almost impossible to filter that out in an ethnography.

02:01.094 --> 02:09.072
It simply is a kind of a fact that a good researcher has to try to contend with along the way.
