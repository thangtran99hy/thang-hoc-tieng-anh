00:09.328 --> 00:11.056
Okay well, the reason we have Scrum is...

00:11.135 --> 00:14.895
...because I came into software development from a medical school.

00:15.036 --> 00:21.775
I had done 11 years funded by the National Cancer Institute's research on complex adaptive systems.

00:21.917 --> 00:27.390
And a large banking company hired me to come in and help them with their advanced technologies.

00:27.961 --> 00:31.363
And as I looked at the way they were managing projects,...

00:32.049 --> 00:34.155
...I realized developers were always late,...

00:34.646 --> 00:38.169
...management was always under pressure; they were putting pressure on the developers.

00:38.674 --> 00:42.069
The more pressure they would put on the developers, the later the project would get.

00:42.636 --> 00:45.833
And the whole thing was designed in such a way...

00:46.385 --> 00:49.281
...that the stable state of the system was not what you wanted.

00:49.825 --> 00:53.056
In order to do that, we had to change the whole dynamics.

00:53.227 --> 00:58.897
Now, what we knew from research at Bell Labs is that we had to have very few roles...

00:59.033 --> 01:01.248
...in the team that was doing software development.

01:01.631 --> 01:07.222
The specialized styles of activity slowed down communications and made it impossible to do.

01:07.664 --> 01:10.112
So, one of the first things we did was we set it up;...

01:10.269 --> 01:12.302
...we only had a team and we had a team leader.

01:12.807 --> 01:17.847
We read a paper by two Japanese business school professors on the best teams in the world.

01:18.507 --> 01:22.936
And they described how the best new product development teams were set up,...

01:23.028 --> 01:26.205
...how the teams were motivated; we set up the team just like that.

01:27.008 --> 01:30.570
The team wanted to know what we would call the team leader; we called him the scrum master.

01:31.705 --> 01:37.981
We then, as we got the role simplified, streamlined and leaned out all the system.

01:38.451 --> 01:42.315
We very quickly found we needed a person we called the product owner,...

01:42.406 --> 01:43.567
...in addition to the scrum master...

01:43.667 --> 01:48.917
...who is responsible for clearly specifying the backlog in the right ordering.

01:49.009 --> 01:53.539
So when we ship the product, it would really take the market as a really good product.

01:53.994 --> 01:56.348
So, we had the product owner, the Scrum master and the team.

01:57.182 --> 02:02.586
We then turned our attention to the meetings because in order to build software fast,...

02:02.780 --> 02:07.150
...you cannot have people going into meetings all the time where they're wasting a lot of time.

02:07.234 --> 02:10.845
So we asked, "What of the minimal meetings we need to have for scrum?"

02:11.620 --> 02:15.506
We knew we needed to deliver a software in short cycles, no more than four weeks.

02:15.901 --> 02:19.164
Probably the majority of the teams now are doing two - week sprints.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.731
So, we needed a meeting at the beginning of the sprint to define...

02:22.872 --> 02:23.971
..."What are we going to..."

02:24.341 --> 02:28.335
"...pull from the product backlog owned by the product owner into that two - week cycle?"

02:29.095 --> 02:32.555
"How are we going to implement it and track it?"

02:33.788 --> 02:35.613
A meeting at the beginning of the cycle,...

02:35.729 --> 02:39.273
...we also knew because again of research done by Bell Labs...

02:39.345 --> 02:42.390
...that the highest performing teams were driven by daily meeting.

02:42.519 --> 02:44.714
So, we knew we had to have the daily meeting.

02:45.003 --> 02:47.041
But we wanted it to be a really short meeting...

02:47.142 --> 02:49.731
...and we got it down to no more than 15 minutes.

02:50.309 --> 02:55.325
And in that meeting, everybody on the team needs to know what everybody else has been doing,...

02:55.533 --> 03:00.027
...what they're going to do next and how they can help one another move really fast.

03:00.913 --> 03:05.027
So, it's like a huddle in a football game but a little bit longer than a huddle.
