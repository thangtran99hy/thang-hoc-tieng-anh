I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.

00:09.188 --> 00:11.513
I've been making games online now for ten years.

00:11.849 --> 00:17.192
And my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy...

00:17.333 --> 00:23.106
...to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games.

00:23.584 --> 00:28.253
Now, I have a plan for this, and it entails convincing more people,...

00:28.334 --> 00:32.943
...including all of you, to spend more time playing bigger and better games.

00:33.332 --> 00:37.730
Right now, we spend three billion hours a week playing online games.

00:38.199 --> 00:41.915
Some of you might be thinking, "That's a lot of time to spend playing games."

00:42.001 --> 00:46.550
"Maybe too much time, considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world."

00:47.083 --> 00:50.501
But actually, according to my research at the Institute for the Future,...

00:51.512 --> 00:53.311
...it's actually the opposite, that's true.

00:53.691 --> 00:59.333
Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems.

00:59.793 --> 01:03.801
In fact, I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet,...

01:04.106 --> 01:06.143
...we need to increase that total dramatically.

01:06.427 --> 01:11.466
I've calculated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week.

01:12.364 --> 01:16.297
So, that's probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea, so I'll say it again.

01:16.365 --> 01:17.231
Let it sink in.

01:17.681 --> 01:22.680
If we want to solve problems like hunger, poverty, climate change, global conflict, obesity,...

01:23.419 --> 01:27.917
...I believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least...

01:28.101 --> 01:30.772
...21 billion hours a week by the end of the next decade.

01:31.326 --> 01:33.481
No, I'm serious. I am.

01:33.951 --> 01:38.183
Here's why. This picture pretty much sums up why I think games are so essential...

01:38.470 --> 01:42.013
...to the future survival of the human species, truly.

01:42.400 --> 01:45.233
This is a portrait by a photographer named Phil Toledano.

01:45.308 --> 01:47.527
He wanted to capture the emotion of gaming,...

01:47.829 --> 01:50.262
...so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing.

01:50.614 --> 01:53.437
And this is a classic gaming emotion.

01:53.727 --> 01:57.401
Now, if you're not a gamer you might miss some of the nuance in this photo.

01:57.462 --> 02:02.333
You probably see the sense of urgency, a little bit of fear,...

02:02.449 --> 02:07.631
...but intense concentration, deep deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem.

02:08.106 --> 02:13.158
If you are a gamer, you will notice a few nuances here. The crinkle of the eyes up...

02:13.407 --> 02:18.327
...and around the mouth is a sign of optimism and the eyebrows up is surprise.

02:18.515 --> 02:22.211
This is a gamer who is on the verge of something called an "epic win".

02:24.222 --> 02:27.201
Oh, you've heard of that. Okay, good. So we have some gamers among us.

02:27.495 --> 02:31.985
So, an epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive...

02:32.064 --> 02:34.800
...you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it.

02:35.633 --> 02:38.289
It was almost beyond the threshold of imagination...

02:38.596 --> 02:41.761
...and when you get there, you are shocked to discover what you are truly capable of.

02:42.069 --> 02:45.447
That's an epic win. This is a gamer on the verge of an epic win.

02:45.725 --> 02:50.773
And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world...

02:50.924 --> 02:53.887
...as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century.

02:54.224 --> 02:58.363
The face of someone who, against all odds, is on the verge of an epic win.

02:58.793 --> 03:02.127
Now, unfortunately, this is more of the face that we see...

03:02.198 --> 03:04.797
...in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems.

03:05.068 --> 03:07.405
This is what I call the "I'm Not Good at Life" face.

03:07.630 --> 03:09.921
And this is actually me making it. Can you see? Yes, good.

03:10.421 --> 03:12.733
This is actually me making the "I'm Not Good at Life" face.

03:13.072 --> 03:16.104
This is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley, California,...

03:16.192 --> 03:20.397
...where I did my PhD on why we're better in games than we are in real life.
