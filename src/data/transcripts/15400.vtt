00:12.064 --> 00:12.816
Here we are, sir!

00:13.265 --> 00:13.757
Hey!

00:16.142 --> 00:16.737
Okay.

00:21.009 --> 00:22.057
Glad you're sitting down, sir.

00:22.688 --> 00:27.251
Because this right here is the finest footwear available on the market today.

00:27.858 --> 00:28.650
Let me introduce you to...

00:30.629 --> 00:31.251
...the future.

00:33.369 --> 00:35.055
Wow, man! This is heavy.

00:35.724 --> 00:36.416
Not heavy at all.

00:36.881 --> 00:39.048
It's actually quite light. Speaking of lights,...

00:41.747 --> 00:43.827
...four hours on a single charge.

00:44.022 --> 00:46.919
I need more density. I mean, my destiny.

00:47.296 --> 00:47.895
Whatever you want.

00:51.884 --> 00:54.193
Shoes! I need shoes!

00:55.966 --> 00:57.168
Well, I got these right here.

00:57.834 --> 00:59.421
Does this power - lace?

01:01.366 --> 01:02.828
Not till 2015.

01:03.161 --> 01:04.385
Not till 2015.

01:04.449 --> 01:06.029
This is 2015!

01:06.989 --> 01:08.621
It's 2011, sir.

01:08.865 --> 01:10.711
Oh! Great Scott!

01:11.217 --> 01:13.255
The timer surface must've malfunctioned.

01:16.340 --> 01:17.869
I don't know what that means, sir.

01:19.387 --> 01:20.322
Where's he going?

01:34.974 --> 01:37.609
Whoa! He made like a tree and got outta here.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.557
There's a fire in the parking lot, guys!

01:43.367 --> 01:45.183
Anybody wanna put out the fire in the parking lot?

01:45.716 --> 01:46.367
Kevin, you wanna go down there?
