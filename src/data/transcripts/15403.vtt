For the past five years, I've been investigating this question of where good ideas come from.

00:08.330 --> 00:11.425
It's the kind of problem I think all of us are intrinsically interested in.

00:11.904 --> 00:15.051
We want to be more creative. We want to come up with better ideas.

00:15.359 --> 00:17.417
We want our organizations to be more innovative.

00:18.368 --> 00:21.557
I've looked at this problem from an environmental perspective.

00:22.089 --> 00:25.398
What are the spaces that have historically led to unusual rates...

00:25.467 --> 00:26.907
...of creativity and innovation?

00:27.805 --> 00:31.930
And what I found in all these systems, there are these recurring patterns...

00:32.010 --> 00:33.211
...that you see again and again...

00:33.509 --> 00:36.544
...that are crucial to creating environments that are unusually innovative.

00:37.387 --> 00:42.368
One pattern I call the "slow hunch": that breakthrough ideas almost never come...

00:42.459 --> 00:46.048
...in a moment of great insight and a sudden stroke of inspiration.

00:46.651 --> 00:51.741
Most important ideas take a long time to evolve and they spend a long time dormant...

00:51.893 --> 00:55.809
...in the background. It isn't until the idea has had two or three years,...

00:56.050 --> 01:00.124
...sometimes ten or twenty years to ensure that it suddenly becomes successful to you...

01:00.233 --> 01:02.085
...and useful to you in a certain way.

01:02.960 --> 01:07.143
And this is partially because good ideas normally come from the collision...

01:07.215 --> 01:11.086
...between smaller hunches so that they form something bigger than themselves.

01:11.640 --> 01:16.555
So you see a lot in the history of innovation, cases of someone who has half of an idea.

01:17.001 --> 01:20.523
There's a great story about the invention of the World Wide Web and Tim Berners-Lee.

01:21.045 --> 01:23.977
This is a project that Berners-Lee worked on for ten years.

01:24.358 --> 01:28.895
But when he started, he didn't have a full vision for this new medium he was going to invent.

01:29.234 --> 01:33.314
He started working on one project as a side project to help him organize his own data.

01:33.605 --> 01:37.007
He scrapped that after a couple of years and then he started working on another thing.

01:37.341 --> 01:41.247
And only after about ten years did the full vision of the World Wide Web come into being.

01:41.983 --> 01:46.723
That is, more often than not, how ideas happen. They need time to incubate.

01:46.981 --> 01:49.829
And they spend a lot of time in this partial hunch form.
