Hi!

00:01.343 --> 00:05.083
Over 20 years ago, Marty Mcfly wore a pair of these in Back to the Future 2.

00:06.001 --> 00:09.871
Now, it is the future and Nike has joined my foundation in our mission to cure Parkinson's.

00:10.524 --> 00:14.043
We're auctioning off 150 pairs of the 2011 Nike Mags here on eBay,...

00:14.135 --> 00:15.559
...every day through September 18th.

00:16.333 --> 00:20.235
Proceeds will help our foundation fund research that could transform the lives of those with Parkinson's.

00:21.159 --> 00:23.256
Please bid, the timing couldn't be better.

00:23.794 --> 00:26.548
A matching gift in effect right now can double your contribution.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.388
Together, we can create a future without Parkinson's.

00:30.171 --> 00:31.379
On behalf of our foundation,...

00:31.485 --> 00:34.793
...Nike, eBay and the five million people living with Parkinson's worldwide,...

00:35.295 --> 00:35.715
...thank you.
