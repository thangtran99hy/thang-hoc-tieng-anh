LG has a new watch phone. It's not the first watch phone,...

00:10.205 --> 00:13.149
...but it's the first touchscreen watch phone from the company.

00:13.530 --> 00:14.981
So Martin, tell us how it works.

00:15.201 --> 00:16.955
Check it out! You've got your analog screen,...

00:17.364 --> 00:19.616
...what you can do is get yourself a digital screen as well.

00:19.732 --> 00:19.953
Wow!

00:20.095 --> 00:22.183
This is cool. Now, that's just the watch feature of it.

00:22.271 --> 00:25.561
Now, let's get to the cooler stuff. Right here in the corner, you've got a camera.

00:25.840 --> 00:27.097
All right, camera guys.

00:27.394 --> 00:30.218
Now, when you wanna make a phone call, of course, you just go to the phone screen...

00:31.075 --> 00:33.559
...and there it is. This is capacitive touch. If you wanna know what that is,...

00:33.827 --> 00:35.369
...that means you need to use the tip of your finger.

00:35.569 --> 00:38.143
Not your fingernail, but the tip of your finger to make a phone call.

00:38.393 --> 00:40.569
The send key is right here, the end key is right there, but,...

00:40.908 --> 00:43.201
...you could also use the bluetooth headset to make the call.

00:43.531 --> 00:46.889
This has voice activated dialing, so if you press the number right here,...

00:47.094 --> 00:49.901
...it'll tell you to say a command right there.

00:50.039 --> 00:52.523
Please say a command, and you say the command, and you make the phone call.

00:52.733 --> 00:57.014
And this is an MP3 player as well. MP3 player is not the last and greatest thing.

00:57.155 --> 01:00.274
What it is, it has tempered glass on it, so it's scratch resistant.

01:00.532 --> 01:03.456
It'll be hard to scratch this. You're worried about getting caught in the rain,...

01:03.673 --> 01:06.523
...don't be. This is also water resistant as well.

01:06.849 --> 01:09.315
Wow! So, this is the magic phone. When is it coming out?

01:09.477 --> 01:10.971
It's coming out later this year, out in Europe.

01:11.309 --> 01:12.250
And how much will it cost?

01:12.577 --> 01:13.427
We're not sure yet.
