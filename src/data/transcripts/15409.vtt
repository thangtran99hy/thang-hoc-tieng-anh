Early last year, First Lady Michelle Obama....

00:12.087 --> 00:15.187
...launched an ambitious national campaign called "Let's Move".

00:15.655 --> 00:20.559
It is aimed at solving the problem of childhood obesity in only one generation.

00:20.655 --> 00:26.681
One of my biggest initiatives is making sure that kids like you all across this country...

00:27.046 --> 00:28.821
...are getting the exercise you need,...

00:29.261 --> 00:31.333
...and that you're eating the proper foods,...

00:31.511 --> 00:36.810
...and you're understanding how that's gonna help you in so many different ways.

00:37.036 --> 00:40.441
The "Let's Move" campaign involves many sectors and partnerships...

00:40.764 --> 00:45.551
...but one of the lighter programs involves sporting events held on the South Lawn of the White House.

00:45.718 --> 00:49.295
For this one, six players from the U.S. Women's National soccer team...

00:49.592 --> 00:51.787
...showed the youngsters some drills on the grass.

00:52.053 --> 00:55.358
It was a special privilege and a thrill for the budding players.

00:55.634 --> 00:57.929
Exercise is close to the First Lady's heart.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.493
And on this day, she was not afraid to show it.

01:00.803 --> 01:04.219
She ran around with the kids and encouraged them in the various drills.

01:04.507 --> 01:10.197
You don't have to become a superstar athlete to enjoy sports and to move.

01:10.804 --> 01:15.221
But getting involved in something fun like this can help you in so many different ways.

01:15.358 --> 01:18.317
So, there's a direct connection between how healthy you are,...

01:18.424 --> 01:20.047
...the kind of food you put in your body,...

01:20.655 --> 01:22.593
...and how your mind operates.

01:22.882 --> 01:27.125
In the past three decades, childhood obesity has tripled in the United States.

01:27.476 --> 01:31.601
Today, nearly one in three children in America is overweight or obese.

01:32.057 --> 01:37.239
The First Lady would like to make a difference in that situation before her husband leaves office.
