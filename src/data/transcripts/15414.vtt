00:07.163 --> 00:09.407
I want you to take a look at this baby.

00:10.315 --> 00:14.625
What you're drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch.

00:15.528 --> 00:18.407
But today, I'm going to talk to you about something you can't see,...

00:18.719 --> 00:21.142
...what's going on up in that little brain of hers.

00:22.268 --> 00:25.927
The modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us...

00:26.253 --> 00:30.066
...that what's going on up there is nothing short of rocket science.

00:30.893 --> 00:36.250
And what we're learning is going to shed some light on what the romantic writers...

00:36.337 --> 00:41.866
...and poets described as the "celestial openness" of the child's mind.

00:43.179 --> 00:48.125
What we see here is a mother in India and she's speaking Koro,...

00:48.488 --> 00:52.485
...which is a newly discovered language. And she's talking to her baby.

00:53.257 --> 00:58.557
What this mother and the 800 people who speak Koro in the world understand...

00:58.641 --> 01:03.009
...is that to preserve this language, they need to speak it to the babies.

01:03.513 --> 01:08.565
And therein lies a critical puzzle. Why is it that you can't preserve a language...

01:08.683 --> 01:13.781
...by speaking to you and I, to the adults? Well, it's got to do with your brain.

01:14.711 --> 01:18.448
What we see here is that language has a critical period for learning.

01:19.225 --> 01:22.778
The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis.

01:25.729 --> 01:29.259
And you'll see on the vertical your skill at acquiring a second language.

01:29.846 --> 01:35.689
The babies and children are geniuses until they turn seven, and then there's a systematic decline.

01:36.168 --> 01:38.341
After puberty, we fall off the map.

01:39.077 --> 01:43.392
No scientist dispute this curve, but laboratories all over the world...

01:43.453 --> 01:45.871
..are trying to figure out why it works this way.

01:46.695 --> 01:50.505
Work in my lab is focused on the first critical period in development...

01:50.610 --> 01:55.507
...and that is the period in which babies try to master which sounds are used in their language.

01:56.013 --> 02:00.433
We think by studying how the sounds are learned, we'll have a model for the rest of language,...

02:00.791 --> 02:04.348
...and perhaps for critical periods that may exist in childhood for social,...

02:04.659 --> 02:06.505
...emotional and cognitive development.

02:07.203 --> 02:11.543
So, we've been studying the babies using a technique that we're using all over the world...

02:11.597 --> 02:13.154
...of the sounds of all languages.

02:13.577 --> 02:15.979
The baby sits on a parent's lap and we train them...

02:16.065 --> 02:19.433
...to turn their heads when a sound changes, like from "ah" to "e".

02:19.819 --> 02:21.619
If they do so at the appropriate time,...

02:21.694 --> 02:24.797
...the black box lights up and a panda bear pounds a drum.

02:25.277 --> 02:27.445
A six - monther adores the task.

02:28.317 --> 02:31.545
What have we learned? Well, babies all over the world...

02:31.634 --> 02:35.234
...are what I like to describe as citizens of the world.

02:35.813 --> 02:38.711
They can discriminate all the sounds of all languages,...

02:38.775 --> 02:41.359
...no matter what country we're testing and what language we're using.

02:42.011 --> 02:44.709
And that's remarkable because you and I can't do that.

02:45.067 --> 02:49.121
We're culture - bound listeners. We can discriminate the sounds of our own language,...

02:49.234 --> 02:50.786
...but not those of foreign languages.
