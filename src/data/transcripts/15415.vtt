00:05.268 --> 00:11.711
The 1980 Geneva Motor Show saw the debut of an automobile that set a new standard for Audi worldwide...

00:12.255 --> 00:16.658
...by combining winning motor sport qualities with the utmost in practicality.

00:17.818 --> 00:20.971
In celebrating the 30th anniversary of that car this year,...

00:21.331 --> 00:24.017
...Audi presents the "Audi Quattro Concept".

00:24.479 --> 00:31.317
A show car that provides 300 kilowatts or 408 horsepower, five-cylinder, turbocharged engine,...

00:31.748 --> 00:37.167
...a lightweight body, and the latest generation of quattro permanent all-wheel drive.

00:38.553 --> 00:43.656
The very first glimpse of the new show car awakens memories of its legendary ancestor,...

00:44.843 --> 00:47.223
...the 1984 Sport Quattro.

00:47.955 --> 00:52.400
The foundation is provided by the powerful, modern-day Audi RS5.

00:53.052 --> 00:58.693
Like its predecessor from 1984, the 2010 show car is also a two-seater.

00:59.199 --> 01:02.280
The body is made primarily of aluminium with the hood,...

01:02.422 --> 01:05.426
...the rear hatch, and other components made of carbon.

01:06.631 --> 01:11.623
As a result, the Audi Quattro concept weighs just 1,300 kilograms...

01:11.938 --> 01:19.294
...or 2,866.01 pounds, almost exactly the same as the Sport Quattro from 1984.

01:20.207 --> 01:24.424
The lightweight know-how of the Quattro concept body will characterize...

01:24.502 --> 01:27.567
...Audi's entire production model portfolio in the future.

01:28.981 --> 01:33.423
In the Audi Quattro concept, the longitudinal FSI turbo...

01:33.693 --> 01:40.840
...accelerates from nought to 100 kilometers per hour or 62.14 mph in only 3.9 seconds.

01:42.880 --> 01:46.598
The Audi Quattro concept uses the latest evolutionary stage...

01:46.711 --> 01:51.405
...of the Quattro permanent all-wheel drive system to deliver its power to the road.

01:52.212 --> 01:55.247
The interior of the coupe is reduced and clean.

01:55.883 --> 02:00.051
The dashboard is very slender and seems to float over the separate center console.

02:00.931 --> 02:04.201
Awaiting the two occupants are filigree bucket seats,...

02:04.440 --> 02:07.379
...developed with the goal of lightweight design at a forefront.

02:08.722 --> 02:12.823
The classic driver orientation of the cockpit is typical Audi.

02:13.499 --> 02:15.801
The instrument cluster is completely digital.

02:16.175 --> 02:20.248
The large, three-dimensional display contains all of the information required...

02:20.343 --> 02:24.857
...by the driver and replaces the classic MMI central display.
