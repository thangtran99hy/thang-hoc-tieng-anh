00:05.489 --> 00:12.019
This is the coin symbolizing the unity Europe is so desperately trying to save: the euro,...

00:12.568 --> 00:15.465
...the currency that binds 17 countries.

00:15.849 --> 00:20.027
Countries now scrambling to find a way out of their financial crisis.

00:20.543 --> 00:23.721
James Walston is with American University in Rome.

00:24.061 --> 00:29.261
They have to do something in order to save the euro, in order to save Europe.

00:30.769 --> 00:34.779
We are not right on the edge yet, but we're fairly close to it.

00:35.089 --> 00:40.110
So close that US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner took the unusual step...

00:40.181 --> 00:43.719
...of meeting with European financial ministers and offering advice.

00:44.250 --> 00:47.155
It is not in the interest of the United States for Europe...

00:47.251 --> 00:50.459
...to be weakened by a protracted economic and financial crisis.

00:51.004 --> 00:54.825
In 2008, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed,...

00:55.112 --> 00:57.751
...sending shockwaves throughout the global economy.

00:58.245 --> 01:02.987
Economist Jacob Kirkegaard says Lehman is similar to the big European banks.

01:03.331 --> 01:07.299
Banks get into an acute crisis. It's gonna have the same sort of shock...

01:07.377 --> 01:10.849
...or heart attack effect if you like on global financial markets.

01:11.153 --> 01:12.758
But here's a big difference.

01:13.008 --> 01:17.876
In 2008, the US responded with an immediate influx of taxpayer money:...

01:18.364 --> 01:21.927
...a 700-billion-dollar relief program known as TARP.

01:22.349 --> 01:27.139
The United States went to one congress for one vote to approve the bailout.

01:27.457 --> 01:31.485
In Europe, you got 17 different parliaments with different schedules,...

01:31.646 --> 01:34.432
...different election calendars that have to do that.

01:34.781 --> 01:39.088
For now, Greece and several other countries are under austerity programs,...

01:41.001 --> 01:46.022
...not at all popular with this group of deaf people protesting against any further cuts.

01:46.483 --> 01:50.069
Some experts suggest Greece be allowed to default on its debt...

01:50.493 --> 01:53.807
...and leave the Eurozone, strengthening the group as a whole.

01:54.464 --> 01:56.207
Paul Taylor is with Reuters.

01:56.551 --> 01:57.674
Greece has got to help itself.

01:57.927 --> 02:02.496
It's really got to finally stick to and implement its austerity program.

02:02.825 --> 02:06.285
That means not listening to even the quietest of protesters...

02:06.703 --> 02:09.767
...and speeding up spending cuts and government layoffs.

02:10.147 --> 02:14.557
Without that additional revenue, Greece is predicted to default next month...

02:15.083 --> 02:18.206
...and the default could spread to other European countries.

02:18.865 --> 02:20.872
