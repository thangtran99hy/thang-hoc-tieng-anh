I bought something from you last week, and I'm very disappointed.

00:06.778 --> 00:08.093
Oh yeah? What's the problem?

00:08.220 --> 00:11.331
Yeah. Well, my blackberry is not working.

00:19.361 --> 00:20.661
What's the matter? You've run out of juice?

00:22.745 --> 00:25.045
No! No! It's completely frozen!

00:26.551 --> 00:28.980
What day are you going to get my blackberry working?

00:29.209 --> 00:32.996
Well, could be an application issue. Where'd you install that blackberry?

00:33.309 --> 00:34.247
It was on my desktop.

00:34.788 --> 00:36.924
You might want to launch the blackberry from the desktop.

00:40.797 --> 00:45.314
Well, I've already tried that a few times, I mean, all it did was mess up windows.

00:47.245 --> 00:51.067
Well, it might be worth waiting a couple of weeks, they got the latest blackberries coming in then.

00:51.369 --> 00:52.348
Could you give me a date?

00:52.729 --> 00:53.027
Certainly.

00:56.178 --> 00:57.925
Let me put that date in my diary.

01:00.487 --> 01:01.656
Anything else I can help you with?

01:01.784 --> 01:06.288
Yes, yes, I've also got a problem, to be honest, with my apple.

01:08.633 --> 01:11.339
Oh dear! Oh dear! That is an old apple isn't it?

01:12.171 --> 01:12.897
When did you buy that?

01:13.296 --> 01:13.824
Last week.

01:14.158 --> 01:15.799
Tell you what, let me try booting it.

01:20.465 --> 01:21.180
Now it's crashed.

01:21.778 --> 01:22.047
Oh.

01:26.536 --> 01:27.600
Anything else I can help you with?

01:27.691 --> 01:31.578
Well funny enough, yes. My grandson's birthday is soon, you see.

01:31.928 --> 01:34.297
Now, he's already got an apple, and a blackberry.

01:34.683 --> 01:37.172
I mean, have you got anything else that he might just like?

01:37.756 --> 01:41.395
Well, we're doing a special offer on these. I mean, I can't make a head or tail of them...

01:41.681 --> 01:45.553
...but the kids seem to like them: eggs box 360.
