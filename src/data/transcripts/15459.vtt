00:00.033 --> 00:02.047
Everyone, please help me welcome Robin Chan.

00:06.467 --> 00:09.697
Thanks for joining us, folks. Today, we have a distinguished panel.

00:09.963 --> 00:12.085
I'd like to kind of give them hats.

00:12.591 --> 00:15.101
We have the entrepreneur, we have the multinational,...

00:15.632 --> 00:18.579
...Linda the dealmaker and we have of course Lip-Bu the sage.

00:21.385 --> 00:24.481
So, just start off with a couple of factoids,...

00:24.887 --> 00:27.955
...why we're in tough times globally in the economy.

00:30.801 --> 00:32.699
Merill, Bank of America announced that...

00:33.567 --> 00:36.215
...they revised up the economic forecast for China,...

00:36.874 --> 00:39.195
...from 8% this year to 8.7%.

00:39.369 --> 00:44.906
Last quarter, China went up to 7.9% GDP growth.

00:46.173 --> 00:51.953
3 takeaways on some factoids you may not know,...

00:52.491 --> 00:57.022
...there is a company that is the largest social network, that's not named Facebook.

00:57.339 --> 01:00.235
And it's making a ton of money, and it's public.

01:00.686 --> 01:04.623
And it, just recently, has a larger market capitalization than Yahoo.

01:05.034 --> 01:05.917
And it's called Tencent.

01:06.754 --> 01:13.815
While the US government is working to support the automotive industry in the US,...

01:16.307 --> 01:19.141
...the Chinese market is now the number one auto market in the world.

01:19.756 --> 01:25.659
GM China is very profitable and in the last quarter, I believe, grew 37%.

01:26.523 --> 01:32.737
And, of course, the most influential and powerful mobile company in the world...

01:33.215 --> 01:35.473
...is not Apple, but China Mobile,...

01:35.629 --> 01:38.212
...with well over 400 million subscribers.

01:39.141 --> 01:43.247
So, looking at these statistics are very seductive, and that's why investors,...

01:44.264 --> 01:48.099
...multinationals and entrepreneurs all want to learn about this market.

01:48.894 --> 01:51.714
We're going to divide the panel in two parts.

01:52.017 --> 01:56.915
The first part is about dispelling a lot of conventional thoughts about what China is about.

01:57.025 --> 02:00.024
And so, there are five myths that I will present...

02:00.194 --> 02:03.466
...and ask these stage panelists what their thoughts are.

02:04.257 --> 02:06.529
The second half is going to be a lot of lessons,...

02:07.029 --> 02:08.819
...hard-earned lessons from the trenches,...

02:09.090 --> 02:14.224
...from the field, about what they learned in working and operating in China.
