Welcome to the Women 2.0 in conversation series. I'm Jasmin Hauck.

00:06.353 --> 00:08.368
Today, I'm talking with Shin-Young Park,...

00:08.913 --> 00:12.793
...founder of a mobile virtual community for teens called Funji.

00:13.144 --> 00:17.961
So I had my first start-up in 1999; it was a baby portal for a child education website...

00:18.287 --> 00:20.553
...and I sold it to an education company in Korea.

00:21.078 --> 00:24.436
And I worked at SK Telecom which is a mobile network company...

00:24.670 --> 00:26.756
...as a project manager for mobile applications...

00:27.129 --> 00:30.854
...when Cyworld and all the mobile games were exponentially growing.

00:31.187 --> 00:36.377
And I moved to the US and the company that I'm doing Funji was my thesis.

00:37.161 --> 00:38.557
So, tell us about Funji.

00:38.987 --> 00:43.259
So, Funji is a mobile virtual community for teens to hang out on the go.

00:43.825 --> 00:48.063
So, they create their avatars and they create their rooms and visit other people's rooms,...

00:48.386 --> 00:50.901
...and trigger communication; they talk to each other.

00:52.049 --> 00:56.579
What's a mistake that you made earlier in your career that you don't want others to repeat?

00:56.973 --> 01:01.224
So, we released the application quickly and iterate fast...

01:01.573 --> 01:05.226
...so that we can learn from the user behavior and complete the engagement loop.

01:06.105 --> 01:08.200
So we should do one by one,...

01:08.339 --> 01:13.365
...adding features and see the user reaction and adding another feature and grow from there.

01:13.823 --> 01:18.503
But including me, a lot of people have the tendency to create another whole new thing...

01:18.709 --> 01:20.145
..and to see what happens.

01:20.632 --> 01:23.393
But usually it doesn't work like that and...

01:23.513 --> 01:28.015
...it's better to invest a little at a time and see how it goes step by step.

01:28.563 --> 01:32.227
So yet rather than having a lot of lists of features,...

01:32.964 --> 01:36.302
...understanding what users want and revising one by one.

01:36.631 --> 01:37.715
I think that's very important.

01:38.077 --> 01:40.933
How do you find good founding team members?

01:41.837 --> 01:47.413
Well, what I found is rather than finding people in random places...

01:48.232 --> 01:53.365
...if you're gonna make a founding team, it's better to find somebody you already know...

01:53.935 --> 01:59.079
...because of the personality, the working style and lifestyle also affect the company,...

01:59.667 --> 02:02.336
...and because they start on this twenty-four seven work, work, work.

02:02.831 --> 02:06.488
You should know the person personally before you work together.

02:06.979 --> 02:09.378
There are some people who say, "Don't have business with friends."

02:10.201 --> 02:12.230
But referral is very good.

02:12.961 --> 02:19.129
So your friend's friend or your co - worker's friend or some kind of relations,...

02:19.426 --> 02:21.100
...I think it works very well.
