d.school is born out of a design - thinking process that really has to do with innovation.

00:10.892 --> 00:12.969
A new kind of leader is needed in the world.

00:13.163 --> 00:16.263
And how we nurture our students in terms of their capacity to tackle...

00:16.323 --> 00:19.479
...some of those broad innovation challenges is fundamentally changing.

00:19.788 --> 00:22.891
For the students to be ready for the 21st century workforce,...

00:23.337 --> 00:24.877
...they need to learn how to collaborate.

00:25.393 --> 00:29.424
They need to improve their speaking skills and analytical skills.

00:31.978 --> 00:34.318
The students are motivated by a lot of different things.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.772
But they all want to change the way they're working.

00:37.424 --> 00:39.500
This is our 5th space in four years.

00:39.927 --> 00:42.849
We've really celebrated a lot of failures along the way...

00:43.158 --> 00:45.864
...and have been very mindful about how to build and how to advance.

00:48.752 --> 00:51.793
In designing this space, we turned our process in upon ourselves...

00:52.209 --> 00:55.238
...and tried to gain empathy for our own community.

00:55.557 --> 00:58.567
Empathy, meaning you pay more attention to people and what the experience is like.

00:58.799 --> 01:03.464
We found out that prototyping in itself and being flexible and creating a space that...

01:03.759 --> 01:05.651
...can evolve is really important.

01:05.977 --> 01:10.058
It was quite interesting to engage with Steelcase to address...

01:10.199 --> 01:13.907
...behavior patterns specific to some spaces at the d.school.

01:14.284 --> 01:17.132
We're actually maybe thinking about classes in a slightly new way.

01:17.372 --> 01:19.603
In the end, we want them to create something.

01:20.081 --> 01:22.766
And when you put students in that posture,...

01:23.164 --> 01:26.828
...what it does is that it flips the whole educational system around.

01:27.166 --> 01:29.805
So now, content has to be generated by the students.

01:30.560 --> 01:35.359
So, in constructivist pedagogies, the students are discovering new concepts...

01:35.424 --> 01:38.869
...and creating their own knowledge instead of memorizing facts.

01:39.162 --> 01:43.086
So, we find very frequently that students will advance their projects almost like in the blues.

01:43.162 --> 01:46.817
It's like a call and response kind of thing where we're giving them a call and they're responding.

01:47.079 --> 01:50.397
What I see as the responsibility of the instructors is...

01:50.463 --> 01:53.385
...to provoke the students to generate that content,...

01:53.639 --> 01:58.873
...allowing the students to participate and allowing the instructor to become more of a guide on the side...

01:59.304 --> 02:00.693
...instead of a sage on the stage.

02:00.913 --> 02:04.483
So, keeping things mobile and flexible is really important to us...

02:04.553 --> 02:06.387
...in terms of empowering the students...

02:06.589 --> 02:07.811
...as well as the teaching teams.

02:08.418 --> 02:11.365
We also like to create environments where students can move around a lot.

02:11.641 --> 02:17.696
We think this is really helpful to sharing leadership responsibility in a collaborative environment.

02:17.943 --> 02:21.716
So what we've designed into the space I think are ways that students can...

02:21.913 --> 02:26.178
...very quickly manifest their ideas. So we like to have them write on vertical surfaces.

02:26.731 --> 02:29.943
We also like to offer different types of spaces for students to work in.

02:30.071 --> 02:34.567
So, we'll do a lot of analog work but to be able to capture it...

02:34.663 --> 02:38.564
...and share it quickly, digital media is the perfect injection.

02:38.846 --> 02:42.668
What the mediascape does is that it allows students to take over a screen...

02:42.741 --> 02:46.689
...so at any given time if someone wants to share something from their computer with a group,...

02:47.065 --> 02:48.044
...they can just tap a button.

02:50.376 --> 02:53.967
A lot of times folks will come into a room and just use it as is and they don't think that...

02:54.121 --> 02:55.689
...it might be in the way of their own work.

02:55.769 --> 02:58.409
Space plays a really important role in learning.

02:58.818 --> 03:00.525
I don't think it's the solution to everything,...

03:00.643 --> 03:02.294
...right? There's lots of factors at play.

03:02.534 --> 03:06.894
And the way we like to think about it is that context can become content.

03:07.236 --> 03:08.151
How can we shape the environment...

03:08.233 --> 03:12.741
...so that we can start changing the behavior of the students or the faculty...

03:12.814 --> 03:16.312
...so it's more likely to lean towards these innovation behaviors?
