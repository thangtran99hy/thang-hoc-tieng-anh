OK. Another form of artifactual communication is your clothing.

00:05.577 --> 00:09.873
What you wear gives a very strong impression of who you are.

00:10.409 --> 00:13.159
Like me, I like red sweaters.

00:13.297 --> 00:17.725
I wear my red sweater almost every day, that's a big part of who I am.

00:18.768 --> 00:20.523
And everybody has a different style.

00:20.956 --> 00:22.921
You know, maybe your style is more formal.

00:23.008 --> 00:28.803
Maybe it's more casual. Maybe you have a very bohemian style where you dress very eclectically.

00:29.356 --> 00:35.360
Neither is good or bad. It simply is a nonverbal expression of who you are.

00:35.769 --> 00:40.543
The only thing that you want to consider when it comes to clothing is,...

00:40.698 --> 00:47.125
..."Are there certain times where you need to alter that expression?"

00:47.692 --> 00:51.788
For example, when I teach a college class I always bring this up to my students.

00:52.213 --> 00:54.391
I tend to dress a little more conservatively.

00:54.895 --> 00:58.857
And I ask my students on the first day of class, "When I walked in the door,...

00:58.945 --> 01:00.450
...what was your impression of me?".

01:00.830 --> 01:03.944
And they rattle off, all these complimentary things, of course...

01:04.063 --> 01:05.469
...because they all want A's.

01:05.945 --> 01:10.149
But then I say to them, "What would you have thought if I had walked through the door...

01:10.263 --> 01:12.863
...in a tank top and cut off shorts?".

01:13.595 --> 01:18.512
And they're all in shock because they wouldn't quite know what to think of that.

01:18.934 --> 01:25.205
But, it would give them an entirely different impression of me because I say to them,...

01:25.350 --> 01:29.296
..."What would you think of me as a professor if I did that?".

01:29.810 --> 01:32.247
And the answers are always completely different...

01:32.637 --> 01:36.506
..than what the initial perception was because of the way I dress.

01:36.910 --> 01:43.134
So, dress is a nonverbal and it's just something to consider...

01:43.266 --> 01:46.660
...again based on whatever situations you might be going into.
