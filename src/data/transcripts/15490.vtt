00:01.687 --> 00:07.749
The wheels on the bus go round and round all through the town.

00:10.427 --> 00:14.089
When we were younger, we were all nihilistic. We didn't care. Live for the day. Live fast.

00:14.805 --> 00:16.173
I thought we were gonna change the world.

00:17.124 --> 00:19.065
It's the trouble making that attracted me.

00:19.254 --> 00:20.841
Drink beer and bash stuff up.

00:22.894 --> 00:27.210
Punk rock was supposed to be about no responsibility, no rules. I'm gonna do things my way.

00:29.133 --> 00:32.147
Maybe punk rock was never meant to grow up, but it did.

00:43.315 --> 00:44.651
Having a baby changed everything.

00:45.946 --> 00:47.292
I get up a lot earlier now.

00:47.775 --> 00:48.723
I know you're tired.

00:49.048 --> 00:51.451
No, I can't take 20 Barbies.

00:52.307 --> 00:54.167
How about this one? This one's like cool, hearts and skulls.

00:56.695 --> 01:00.845
It's tough to be a punk rock hero and to be a good authority figure for your kids.

01:00.999 --> 01:02.053
Homework, bath, bed.

01:02.491 --> 01:04.404
How am I supposed to shelter the "F" word?

01:04.480 --> 01:07.357
The two dominatrixes on my arm, how do you explain that to a four-year-old?

01:08.393 --> 01:09.506
No!

01:12.667 --> 01:16.487
There's nothing really in the punk rock ethos that prepares you for being a dad.

01:19.803 --> 01:21.280
My parents weren't really present.

01:21.694 --> 01:23.393
Our dads weren't there, man.

01:24.076 --> 01:26.913
Being gone all the time doesn't give you that bonding that you need.

01:29.995 --> 01:34.381
How did we go from rebelling against our own parents and become parents ourselves?

01:34.903 --> 01:39.156
The classic parent attitude with a kid like, "I brought you into this world, I gave you life".

01:39.245 --> 01:41.141
It's like, I just think completely opposite.

01:41.311 --> 01:45.224
My kids gave me life, you know, they gave me a reason.

01:57.547 --> 02:00.901
That's what I wanna hold on to. It's that feeling that we can make a change out there...

02:00.995 --> 02:04.296
...and maybe the way we change the world is by raising a better kid.

02:09.184 --> 02:13.850
Sometimes you think about, "Oh, should I've tattooed my forehead." You know.
