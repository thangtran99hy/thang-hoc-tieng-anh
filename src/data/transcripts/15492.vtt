Nobody tells people who are beginners,...

00:05.183 --> 00:06.815
...and I really wish somebody told this to me,...

00:07.349 --> 00:10.626
...that all of us who do creative work, you know, we get into it...

00:10.751 --> 00:12.428
...and we get into it because we have good taste.

00:12.785 --> 00:13.763
But it's like there's a gap.

00:14.174 --> 00:18.603
That for the first couple of years that you're making stuff, what you're making isn't so good.

00:18.768 --> 00:19.809
Okay, it's not that great.

00:20.322 --> 00:23.003
It's trying to be good. It has ambition to be good but it's not quite that good.

00:23.502 --> 00:27.311
But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, your taste is still killer.

00:27.626 --> 00:29.379
And your taste is good enough that you can tell...

00:29.637 --> 00:32.077
...what you're making is kind of a disappointment to you,...

00:32.225 --> 00:32.797
...you know what I mean?

00:33.679 --> 00:36.489
A lot of people never get past that phase and a lot of people at that point, they quit.

00:37.213 --> 00:39.878
And the thing I would just like to say to you with all my heart...

00:40.281 --> 00:45.105
...is that most everybody I know who does interesting creative work,...

00:45.458 --> 00:49.029
...they went through a phase of years where they have really good taste.

00:49.208 --> 00:51.590
And they could tell what they were making wasn't as good as they want it to be.

00:51.696 --> 00:52.969
They knew it fell short.

00:53.238 --> 00:55.937
It didn't have the special thing that we wanted it to have.

00:56.534 --> 00:59.255
And the thing is, everybody goes through that.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.593
And for you to go through it, if you're going through it right now,...

01:01.691 --> 01:03.073
... if you're just getting out of that phase,...

01:03.263 --> 01:07.467
...you've got to know it's totally normal. And the most important possible thing you can do...

01:07.860 --> 01:08.688
...is do a lot of work.

01:09.017 --> 01:10.155
Do a huge volume of work.

01:10.422 --> 01:12.940
Put yourself on a deadline, so that every week or every month...

01:13.066 --> 01:14.903
...you know you're going to finish one story.

01:15.386 --> 01:17.789
Because it's only by actually going through a volume of work...

01:18.187 --> 01:20.687
...that you are actually going to catch up and close that gap.

01:21.199 --> 01:24.696
And the work you're making will be as good as your ambitions.

01:25.293 --> 01:29.053
In my case, I took longer to figure out...

01:29.865 --> 01:31.966
...how to do this than anybody I've ever met.

01:33.278 --> 01:35.637
It takes a while. It's going to take you a while.

01:35.741 --> 01:39.743
It's normal to take a while and you just have to fight your way through that.

01:40.494 --> 01:40.929
Okay?
