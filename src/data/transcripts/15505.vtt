The music team of RedFoo and SkyBlu spent six weeks at Number One on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart this year...

00:30.530 --> 00:33.298
...and earned the "Song of Summer Award" for its biggest hit.

00:33.706 --> 00:37.319
The duo's sophomore CD is called "Sorry for the Party Rocking".

00:37.793 --> 00:40.339
With all that success, why apologize?

00:42.302 --> 00:44.680
Maybe it's for the kid to say to the parent you know,...

00:45.555 --> 00:50.027
...maybe the kids in the backseat of the car with their Walkman on and they start...

00:50.639 --> 00:52.904
...rolling down the window and talking about, "Every day, you know..."

00:55.424 --> 00:57.455
"Can you just please stop yelling out of the car?"

00:58.561 --> 01:00.564
"Hey, come on Mom, sorry for party rocking."

01:08.088 --> 01:13.493
LMFAO is a strange name for a band that was once known as the "Sexy Dudes"...

01:13.929 --> 01:16.992
...especially when you consider the person who gave them their name.

01:17.402 --> 01:19.022
So, we were on the iChat and I said,...

01:19.114 --> 01:22.609
..."Hey grandma, what do you think about our name, 'Sexy Dudes'?"

01:23.150 --> 01:26.373
And she just put "LMFAO, I cannot believe you."

01:28.061 --> 01:32.271
He came out of the shower dripping and said, "Look at that, that's magical."

01:32.619 --> 01:33.838
Grandma knows best.

01:45.890 --> 01:52.903
LMFAO, whose real names are Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, share more than just a name.

01:53.291 --> 01:58.101
They explain their family connection to legendary Motown founder, Berry Gordy Jr.

01:58.467 --> 02:02.301
I'm the grandson and he is the son of Berry Gordy.

02:02.415 --> 02:03.311
Oh, Berry Gordy's son.

02:03.839 --> 02:08.334
He's the grandson and he's my nephew.

02:08.481 --> 02:08.746
That's right.

02:09.244 --> 02:15.963
Because I'm the son and uncle, son of Berry and uncle of Sky.

02:16.399 --> 02:18.089
My dad is his brother.

02:18.937 --> 02:20.772
Which is named Berry too.

02:20.917 --> 02:21.131
Right.

02:22.341 --> 02:24.248
So Berry is my brother and my father.

02:24.616 --> 02:24.959
That's weird.

02:32.701 --> 02:35.200
It has been a fast ride for LMFAO,...

02:35.406 --> 02:39.172
...who, in only two years, have earned multiple award nominations...

02:39.437 --> 02:41.966
...along with gold and platinum album sales.

02:42.111 --> 02:44.304
Six weeks at Number One is really amazing.

02:45.736 --> 02:50.361
It's just that it's an amazing benchmark to know that, hey, your dream is real.

02:50.411 --> 02:51.105
You know what I mean?

02:51.175 --> 02:55.236
So, you can really do what you've always wanted to do your whole life as a kid.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.246
So, it feels great that we're on the right path...

02:58.351 --> 03:01.185
...and we're just making a lot of people happy around the world, man, you know.

03:08.795 --> 03:12.707
While some call it dance music and others call it electropop...

03:13.192 --> 03:16.852
...only LMFAO know what their music is all about.

03:17.116 --> 03:18.888
You know we make music for the party,...

03:19.096 --> 03:22.249
...for party rocking and we come from a hip-hop background.

03:22.662 --> 03:30.234
But we kind of noticed that there's this world that loves to party and we love that world so much.

03:30.464 --> 03:32.561
We like comedy, we like dancing,...

03:33.166 --> 03:36.425
...and when we just always think about what we like, the songs...

03:37.408 --> 03:40.057
...start to always kind of have some dance, always...

03:40.158 --> 03:43.594
...you know, every video we want to have some kind of dancing because we like to dance.

03:50.960 --> 03:55.159
LMFAO's Redfoo and Skyblu know how to have a good time.

03:55.441 --> 03:56.933
And from the look of their concerts,...

03:57.061 --> 03:59.566
...their fans are also having a good time.

04:00.545 --> 04:02.715
I'm Larry London, VOA News.
