00:10.100 --> 00:13.471
You can talk to it and it responds.

00:15.608 --> 00:21.362
It has a dual-core processor, making it faster, and it has a better camera and camcorder.

00:21.886 --> 00:27.081
Technology journalist Luke Peters says features like the voice command known as "Siri"...

00:27.410 --> 00:29.722
...bring innovation to the smartphone industry.

00:30.122 --> 00:32.437
But, you know, there's a lot of features here that Apple,...

00:33.845 --> 00:36.898
...there's a lot of features under the phone that Apple have been playing catch-up with as well.

00:37.109 --> 00:38.517
That didn't matter to some.

00:39.193 --> 00:42.523
One of the first in line told VOA he traveled from Denmark...

00:42.838 --> 00:45.432
...and waited an entire day to get the phone.

00:46.035 --> 00:50.931
And the first guy out of the store came for Steve Jobs, the late Apple co-founder.

00:51.455 --> 00:54.460
He basically, I feel that he was such an innovator...

00:55.248 --> 00:59.459
...that he created a better world for us; that he made everything better.

01:00.329 --> 01:04.181
Thousands of people are lined up here behind me at this Apple store in Central London...

01:04.265 --> 01:06.903
...just waiting to get their hands on the new iPhone 4s.

01:07.517 --> 01:11.080
But the craze didn't start here. It actually started when Apple...

01:11.232 --> 01:14.554
...made the phone available for pre-ordering with a record-breaking...

01:14.735 --> 01:18.200
...one million pre-ordered in the first 24 hours.

01:19.121 --> 01:22.546
The London School of Economics' Silvia Elaluf-Calderwood says...

01:22.653 --> 01:26.285
...the hype is not necessarily over the features, but the brand.

01:26.519 --> 01:30.780
The emotional aspects of the release of 4s cannot be underestimated.

01:31.012 --> 01:36.237
Many people are buying this phone in some ways because they are attached to Mac.

01:37.252 --> 01:40.260
With one company's fortune comes another's hardship.

01:40.496 --> 01:45.795
Blackberry maker, Research In Motion, had network outages this week spanning five continents.

01:46.252 --> 01:50.493
RIM CEO Michael Lazaridis apologized to customers on Wednesday.

01:50.583 --> 01:54.713
I apologize for the service outages this week. We've let many of you down.

01:55.707 --> 01:58.689
But let me assure you that we're working around the clock to fix this.

01:59.688 --> 02:02.697
You expect better from us and I expect better from us.

02:02.990 --> 02:06.187
For some Blackberry users the apology came too late.

02:06.621 --> 02:11.478
The iPhone 4s now has a popular feature that once sold consumers on Blackberry.

02:11.898 --> 02:16.593
An internal messaging system that incurs no charges for users of the phone.

02:17.113 --> 02:24.219
Blackberry messenger is just so confusing, like it's been down for about a week now.

02:24.307 --> 02:30.418
And I just thought, "You know what? I'm going to get this instead." It's just going to be better.

02:30.530 --> 02:35.271
And hopefully next year I'll upgrade to the iPhone 5.

02:35.915 --> 02:40.495
Elaluf-Calderwood says Research In Motion has seen a drop in its sales by 3%...

02:40.671 --> 02:42.458
...for each of the last three quarters.

02:42.717 --> 02:46.880
RIM really needs to come up with something really new if they want to continue this game.

02:47.385 --> 02:51.325
But while its sales are down, Blackberry is still attractive to some users.

02:51.509 --> 02:54.325
Elaluf-Calderwood says it's good for people on a budget.

02:54.722 --> 03:00.159
But she says both Blackberry and Apple face major competition from the real smartphone giant:...

03:00.511 --> 03:05.531
...Google Android, which now owns 50% of the market share and is growing.

03:06.387 --> 03:09.314
