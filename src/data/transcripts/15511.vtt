00:27.694 --> 00:33.361
Renowned civil rights leader Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. galvanized the U.S. civil rights movement...

00:33.453 --> 00:36.825
...with his "I Have a Dream" speech in 1963.

00:37.301 --> 00:41.443
His nonviolent message calling for an end to racial segregation.

00:42.283 --> 00:44.045
I still have a dream.

00:45.933 --> 00:50.830
Almost half a century later, thousands convened on Washington's national mall...

...greeted reporters before his formal remarks,...

01:27.171 --> 01:29.346
...saying King's fight must go on.

01:29.539 --> 01:35.187
We have some obligation not just to glow in this but keep raising the challenging,...

01:35.375 --> 01:38.261
...disturbing moral questions of economic justice and fairness.

02:15.488 --> 02:18.337
...who was just 6 years old when King was assassinated.

02:19.254 --> 02:23.811
Because of that hopeful vision, because of Dr. King's moral imagination,...

02:25.346 --> 02:29.613
...barricades began to fall and bigotry began to fade.

02:31.284 --> 02:34.781
New doors of opportunity swung open for an entire generation.

02:37.305 --> 02:41.043
Yes, laws changed but hearts and minds changed as well.

02:41.647 --> 02:46.325
The ten meter tall statue of Dr. King reminds the world of his fight for equality...

02:46.992 --> 02:51.036
