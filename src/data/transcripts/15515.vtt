OK, here are two questions that can change your career,...

00:08.357 --> 00:10.784
...your business, maybe even your life.

00:12.005 --> 00:13.959
The first comes from Claire Boothe Luce,...

00:14.334 --> 00:16.601
...one of the first women to serve in the U.S. Congress.

00:18.016 --> 00:21.397
One day in the early 1960s, she went to visit President Kennedy.

00:22.048 --> 00:26.310
And she told him this, "A great man is a sentence."

00:27.947 --> 00:31.524
Abraham Lincoln's sentence was, "He preserved the Union and freed the slaves."

00:32.913 --> 00:38.497
Franklin Roosevelt's sentence was, "He lifted us out of a great depression and helped us win a world war."

00:39.977 --> 00:42.666
Luce worried that Kennedy was trying to do too many things...

00:43.155 --> 00:45.983
...and that his sentence risked becoming a muddled paragraph.

00:47.228 --> 00:53.206
If you really want to find your true motivation, ask yourself that question, "What's my sentence?".

00:54.754 --> 00:57.023
You don't have to be president of anything for this to help.

00:58.117 --> 01:01.749
Maybe your sentence is, "She invented a device that made people's lives easier."

01:02.867 --> 01:06.342
Maybe it's, "He taught two generations of kids how to read."

01:08.056 --> 01:11.751
Think about your sentence, then use it to navigate your life.

01:13.107 --> 01:17.425
But to make your sentence really come alive and to create motivation that lasts,...

01:17.851 --> 01:18.894
...you need a second question.

01:19.909 --> 01:26.383
So, each night before you go to sleep ask yourself, "Was I better today than yesterday?"

01:28.007 --> 01:31.016
Keep asking that question because that's how we really improve.

01:31.765 --> 01:36.572
Day by day, step by step, over and over for a very long time.

01:38.013 --> 01:40.341
It's tough, but it's the only way.

01:41.947 --> 01:44.632
Combine these two questions and motivation...

01:45.301 --> 01:49.175
...at work, in business and the rest of your life....

01:50.289 --> 01:51.126
...will take care of itself.

01:53.595 --> 01:57.480
