You're watching our special show "Change Agents" and we're coming to you from the India Economic Summit...

00:11.931 --> 00:15.839
...which is playing host to the Fifth India Social Entrepreneur of the Year Awards,...

00:16.205 --> 00:19.509
...handed out by the Schwab Foundation in association with the UNDP.

00:19.945 --> 00:22.427
On to the final winners of the awards this evening,...

00:22.493 --> 00:25.591
...it's a teacher duo, Padmanabha Rao and Rama Rao.

00:25.647 --> 00:28.727
They started off their initiative in 1987 in Rishi Valley.

00:29.005 --> 00:31.009
And it was while they were teaching in rural Andhra Pradesh...

00:31.104 --> 00:33.669
...that they realized the need for relevant content...

00:33.967 --> 00:37.551
...to actually be able to reach out to children in rural India.

00:37.935 --> 00:39.441
That's where the idea came from.

00:39.748 --> 00:43.444
Over their journey so far, they've reached out to over 75,000 schools...

00:43.517 --> 00:47.018
...and touched the lives of eight million children across India.

00:47.329 --> 00:47.959
Here's their story.

00:49.343 --> 00:52.473
It was an invitation to teach in the rural outback of Andhra...

00:52.761 --> 00:56.313
...that got Padmanabha Rao and his wife, Rama, to leave the city of Hyderabad...

00:56.679 --> 00:58.217
...and return to their grass roots.

00:58.369 --> 01:01.672
But the opportunity to teach in the Rishi Valley in 1987...

01:02.011 --> 01:05.387
...was the catalyst that got him going on a change mission.

01:06.421 --> 01:09.227
Familiar with the apathy of the education system in India,...

01:09.633 --> 01:14.596
...this teacher duo launched RIVER, Rishi Valley Institute for Education Resources,...

01:14.906 --> 01:17.319
...an initiative that creates teaching curriculum...

01:17.649 --> 01:22.210
...involving the local community in the process of education to help children learn better.

01:22.793 --> 01:27.459
"We just started the whole thing as the finding of solutions to our own local problems..."

01:27.813 --> 01:28.998
"...in and around Rishi Valley."

01:29.301 --> 01:34.363
"I mean, we didn't think about me being a national or international resource..."

01:34.449 --> 01:35.885
"...and coming up with a model which would..."

01:36.381 --> 01:41.043
"We started finding local solutions because we firmly believe that most of these problems,..."

01:41.406 --> 01:44.171
"...for all local problems, we have to find local solutions."

01:44.494 --> 01:47.038
"The kind of local insight that was already here in our minds,..."

01:47.585 --> 01:50.639
"...the local ingenuity and finding local solutions, not to look for..."

01:51.015 --> 01:53.985
"...outsiders or other countries for solutions."

01:54.065 --> 01:58.307
"Because we have our very own, what do you say, local kind of problems..."

01:58.439 --> 02:00.824
"...and for that we need to find local solutions."
