00:00.527 --> 00:06.625
He was Libya's self-styled revolutionary leader who ruled with an iron fist for more than 40 years.

00:07.285 --> 00:12.013
Colonel Muammar Gaddafi said he would rather die than step down from the leadership of Libya.

00:12.639 --> 00:16.479
But his grip on power also resulted in the death of many others.

00:17.018 --> 00:20.131
He leaves behind a country deeply scarred by his rule.

00:20.618 --> 00:33.739
Gaddafi was delusional, unpredictable, disloyal, vindictive and bent on entering history...

00:34.611 --> 00:41.539
...in the most significant way, even if that comes at the expense of people around him.

00:42.631 --> 00:50.393
In September 1969, a 27 - year - old Muammar Gaddafi led a group of army officers in a coup against King Idris.

00:51.033 --> 00:53.479
They proclaimed a new Libyan Arab Republic.

00:56.115 --> 00:59.699
Gaddafi modeled himself on Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser.

01:00.296 --> 01:03.209
The young colonel wanted to be a leader of the Arab world.

01:04.378 --> 01:11.135
At home, Gaddafi declared a cultural revolution. People's committees were formed.

01:11.492 --> 01:16.035
They were used to take over businesses and silence dissidents. Many disappeared.

01:18.137 --> 01:21.569
Gaddafi published the Green Book which established the rule of the masses.

01:21.913 --> 01:25.979
In reality, the colonel exercised nearly total control of government.

01:27.249 --> 01:31.633
He even ordered the adoption of a new calendar based on the death of the prophet Muhammad.

01:32.052 --> 01:36.058
Meanwhile, Gaddafi antagonized the West, particularly the United States...

01:36.362 --> 01:39.416
...which labeled Libya a state sponsor of terrorism.

01:40.474 --> 01:48.246
The mad dog of the Middle East has a goal of a world revolution, Muslim fundamentalist revolution...

01:48.386 --> 01:49.220
...which is targeted on...

01:49.405 --> 01:54.879
Gaddafi did support the Palestinian Liberation Organization and he funded the Irish Republican Army,...

01:55.198 --> 01:56.788
...and Colombia's FARC guerrillas.

01:57.872 --> 02:05.189
Then in 1986, a Libyan sponsored attack on a discotheque in Berlin, killed three and wounded more than 250,...

02:05.580 --> 02:07.582
...including 50 American servicemen.

02:10.787 --> 02:17.023
The US responded by launching a series of air strikes on Libya, targets included Gaddafi's residence in Tripoli,...

02:17.473 --> 02:20.969
...killing more than a hundred people including Gaddafi's adopted daughter, Hanna.

02:22.313 --> 02:29.385
Two years later Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over the town of Lockerbie in Scotland, killing 270 people.

02:29.859 --> 02:35.823
Gaddafi denied involvement, Libya endured years of UN sanctions and international isolation.

02:36.667 --> 02:40.596
But he eventually surrendered the suspects demanded by London and Washington DC.

02:41.962 --> 02:46.324
Then came September 11th. Gaddafi joined the West in fighting Al-Qaeda.

02:48.601 --> 02:53.868
He abandoned his development of weapons of mass destruction but Arab world ties remain strained.

02:54.547 --> 02:57.166
There had been claims that Libyan intelligence was behind the plot...

02:57.256 --> 03:00.381

03:05.103 --> 03:07.729
...Gaddafi accused the Saudis of being US puppets...

03:08.164 --> 03:10.989
...prompting an angry response from the then - crowned Prince Abdullah.

03:11.579 --> 03:15.443
By then, Gaddafi had done enough to be welcomed back onto the world stage,...

03:15.919 --> 03:18.165
...playing host to the world leaders in the spotlight.

03:19.890 --> 03:25.471
Estranged from the Arab world, Gaddafi turned to Africa. He proposed the United States of Africa,...

03:25.765 --> 03:28.270
...a grandiose project that was never taken seriously.

03:30.299 --> 03:34.408
As an uprising against Gaddafi gathered earlier this year, he blamed everyone...

03:34.475 --> 03:39.315
...from the United States to Al-Qaeda, and a so-called drugged up "rats and cats" of Libya.

03:43.125 --> 03:49.063
In one of his last televised addresses, Gaddafi threatened massive violence to quash protesters.

03:51.506 --> 03:57.608

03:58.369 --> 04:01.092
Gaddafi's hometown of Sirte was his final stronghold.

04:06.535 --> 04:11.165

04:11.826 --> 04:18.200
Despite its oil wealth, the vast majority of Libyans live on around $2 a day. 40% are jobless.

04:20.345 --> 04:26.907
Many will remember Gaddafi as the leader who set Libya back many years. Matthew Moore, Al Jazeera.
