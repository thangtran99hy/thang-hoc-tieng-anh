Hi I'm Rick Stengel. I'm the editor of Time Magazine and I am here with Bill Gates...

00:04.315 --> 00:06.902
...to talk about his story for Time this week.

00:07.465 --> 00:08.019
Welcome Bill.

00:08.383 --> 00:08.721
Thank you.

00:09.225 --> 00:14.062
It's all about your big idea of creative capitalism. I'd love you to tell our readers...

00:14.768 --> 00:16.441
...what the heck creative capitalism is.

00:16.921 --> 00:20.421
Well, capitalism has done a great job for the people who are well-off.

00:21.081 --> 00:26.971
But if we look at the disparity between the poorest and the rest of the world, that gap is growing.

00:27.311 --> 00:33.029
And so the question is, can we take some of the caring and innovation power, the resources...

00:33.469 --> 00:38.706
...of corporations and get them to focus more of that on the needs of the poorest?

00:39.163 --> 00:43.169
And it's very timely, because whether it's breakthroughs in medicine...

00:43.285 --> 00:45.570
...or using cellphones in creative ways,...

00:45.795 --> 00:49.089
...new forms of banking, food with better nutrition,...

00:49.459 --> 00:53.119
...there are clearly some things that these large companies with their...

00:53.433 --> 00:55.922
...great resources and their innovation power,...

00:56.223 --> 01:01.602
...if we get them to apply that more significantly for those with the most need,...

01:01.925 --> 01:08.743
...that we can reduce impoverishment far faster than simply relying on government alone.
