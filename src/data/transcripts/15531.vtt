00:02.637 --> 00:06.251
Andres Lopez Ovejero is running late to a very important meeting.

00:07.133 --> 00:11.111
I decided to go with more of a business suit, a little more business,...

00:11.775 --> 00:13.108
...a little more professional today.

00:13.735 --> 00:17.776
But it soon becomes clear, he's not on his way to a job interview.

00:18.887 --> 00:22.899
You're taking your shoes off, take off your pants, your underwear,...

00:23.374 --> 00:27.283
...you're really showing to a whole bunch of people that are not expecting to see it.

00:27.366 --> 00:31.029
Today, Lopez is stripping down to his underwear on the subway.

00:32.297 --> 00:34.005
Fortunately, he's not alone.

00:35.209 --> 00:41.670
This is the No Pants Subway Ride 2K10, Improv Everywhere's ninth annual No Pants Subway Ride.

00:41.920 --> 00:48.419
It's an organized prank with a couple of hundred people getting on various subway trains,...

00:48.833 --> 00:53.243
...and then in a very ordered fashion, they take off their pants, leaving only their underwear.

00:53.795 --> 00:56.851
They step, they get off the train, step onto the platform,...

00:56.953 --> 00:59.256
...wait on the train platform and get on other trains.

01:00.572 --> 01:01.882
Some riders were confused.

01:07.765 --> 01:11.296
Others were amused. Then some were downright shocked.

01:11.427 --> 01:14.137
I thought they were crazy. They were crazy people.

01:14.253 --> 01:17.457
I was simply terrified. I thought when they started taking their pants down,...

01:17.529 --> 01:22.176
...I thought they were gonna strip totally. I was hitting him. What is he doing? Oh my god!

01:22.479 --> 01:26.665
This year, they met at five different stops and rode the subway to Union Square,...

01:26.959 --> 01:28.586
...where they gathered for a celebration.

01:28.727 --> 01:31.267
Down with pants! Down with pants!

01:31.467 --> 01:35.641
It's funny. It's good, wholesome, clean fun, and I like getting naked in public.

01:37.267 --> 01:40.761
People of all ages came to catch a glimpse of the festivities.

01:41.275 --> 01:42.447
Would you ever do something like this?

01:43.687 --> 01:48.125
At my age, I don't think so, but I probably would have if I was younger.

01:50.342 --> 01:52.681
Lopez says it's a great place to meet new people.

01:53.698 --> 01:56.932
However, he wasn't expecting to run into any familiar faces.

01:57.467 --> 01:59.108
Where did you come from?

01:59.289 --> 01:59.975
That's my office.

02:00.627 --> 02:04.373
This is an old friend from college who stumbled upon the event on her way home.

02:04.700 --> 02:05.959
I haven't seen you in a long time.

02:06.395 --> 02:07.844
Yes, yes!

02:08.240 --> 02:10.129
So what are you doing here without your pants on?

02:11.952 --> 02:13.907
Just hanging out without my pants on.

02:14.439 --> 02:17.552
Though caught with his pants down, Lopez says it was all worth it.

02:17.766 --> 02:22.107
It's just to have fun, it's just to enjoy yourself.

02:22.405 --> 02:24.309
And are you looking forward to putting your pants back on?

02:25.816 --> 02:28.979
Not so much. I'm more looking forward to taking them off again next year.

02:30.331 --> 02:34.125
In New York, I'm Natasha del Toro reporting for TIME.com.
