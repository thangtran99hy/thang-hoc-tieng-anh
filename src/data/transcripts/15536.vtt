Hi, I'm Ashwin Vasavada, the deputy project scientist...

00:10.097 --> 00:12.985
...for the Mars Science Laboratory mission and its Curiosity rover.

00:13.799 --> 00:17.435
So, a lot of people wonder why Curiosity doesn't have solar panels,...

00:17.982 --> 00:20.262
...like the Mars exploration rover, Spirit, and Opportunity.

00:20.899 --> 00:23.779
The Mars exploration rovers often found themselves short on power...

00:23.869 --> 00:25.344
...as dust settled on their solar panels.

00:25.969 --> 00:28.152
This was especially a problem in the short days of winter.

00:28.791 --> 00:31.319
We need a good, strong, and reliable source of power...

00:31.581 --> 00:33.856
...to keep Curiosity going for over two years on Mars.

00:34.804 --> 00:39.837
Curiosity is two times bigger, five times heavier and has 15 times the weight of scientific equipment,...

00:40.077 --> 00:41.437
...relative to Spirit and Opportunity.

00:42.090 --> 00:46.196
Like those rovers, Curiosity surveys the landscape and examines rocks and cliffs.

00:47.301 --> 00:53.053
Curiosity's scientific mission involves driving around its landing site, perhaps up to 15 or 20 miles,...

00:53.491 --> 00:59.079
...collecting samples of rocks and soils with a big jackhammer drill located on the end of a six foot robotic arm.

00:59.613 --> 01:03.187
Those samples are delivered to the rover and analyzed with some very sophisticated...

01:03.556 --> 01:06.183
...and power hungry, analytical laboratory instruments.

01:06.910 --> 01:09.139
And that's where the "MMRTG" comes in.

01:09.755 --> 01:12.689
The "Multi Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator"...

01:13.099 --> 01:14.961
...is a power source that we've used for years...

01:15.173 --> 01:17.767
...to power a spacecraft that have gone to the outer planets,...

01:18.146 --> 01:20.123
...and even the Apollo missions used it on the moon.

01:21.131 --> 01:25.303
Behind me, you can see a full-scale model of Curiosity, including the generator in the back.

01:26.323 --> 01:29.153
On this half scale model of the generator, you can see what's inside.

01:29.814 --> 01:33.475
The generator contains a specially produced form of plutonium dioxide.

01:33.989 --> 01:36.684
The natural decay of this radioisotope gives off heat,...

01:37.153 --> 01:39.397
...which these thermocouples can turn into electricity.

01:40.182 --> 01:43.175
The generator provides both electrical power and heat to the rover.

01:43.518 --> 01:48.023
About a hundred watts of electrical power is used to continuously charge the rovers battery.

01:48.615 --> 01:53.747
Also, heat can be pumped off of the generator using pipes to keep the rover's inside warm.

01:54.022 --> 01:55.445
Including the scientific instruments.

01:56.272 --> 01:59.769
With Curiosity's generator, there's a guaranteed way of charging the battery...

01:59.882 --> 02:01.687
...year round in all sorts of conditions.

02:02.772 --> 02:05.431
Curiosity's generator was developed by the Department of Energy...

02:05.573 --> 02:08.036
...and will be installed on the rover just a few days before launch.

02:08.619 --> 02:12.553
But to make sure everything works together properly, the engineers install the actual generator...

02:12.871 --> 02:14.065
...on the rover for the first time.

02:14.522 --> 02:16.458
The blue light that you see was just additional lighting...

02:16.549 --> 02:18.414
...to help them make sure they could see what they were doing.

02:19.504 --> 02:23.422
The Curiosity rover and the spacecraft that will take it to Mars are currently in Florida,...

02:23.740 --> 02:25.694
...undergoing its final preparations for launch.

02:26.213 --> 02:30.651
Everything's going well and all of us in the science team can't wait for its launch later this year...

02:30.976 --> 02:32.469
...and its arrival to Mars next summer.

02:33.217 --> 02:36.235
I'm Ashwin Vasavada and this has been your "Building Curiosity" update.
