00:04.311 --> 00:04.613
What's the matter?

00:05.059 --> 00:06.329
You know what's the matter. I'm unhappy.

00:06.865 --> 00:07.883
You agreed to play the turkey.

00:07.946 --> 00:09.707
I never agreed. Why would I agree to be the turkey?

00:09.765 --> 00:14.197
You know, it's not a big deal. All you do is cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, and you wave.

00:14.273 --> 00:16.839
First of all, we don't cluck. We gobble, okay?

00:16.979 --> 00:17.767
I stand corrected.

00:17.865 --> 00:20.701
Yeah. And if it's not such a big deal, why don't you be the turkey?

00:21.137 --> 00:21.897
You want me to be the turkey?

00:21.969 --> 00:22.535
Yeah, come on!

00:23.858 --> 00:25.120
You want me to be the turkey?

00:25.295 --> 00:25.590
Yeah!

00:27.289 --> 00:28.109
I don't think so.

00:28.366 --> 00:30.530
You know "turkeyisms" that I don't know,...

00:30.716 --> 00:34.566
...even the expression on your face is quintessential turkey.

00:35.177 --> 00:37.658
I don't see myself as a turkey, you know, if it was an eagle,...

00:37.729 --> 00:41.072
...I might consider it. An eagle is graceful, it flies and soars.

00:41.140 --> 00:43.535
The only problem was that the eagle wasn't very tasty.

00:43.992 --> 00:44.557
You're gonna be great.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.537
What the hell are you talking about?

00:48.700 --> 00:48.965
I don't know.

00:49.327 --> 00:50.279
Boy, am I stuffed.

00:50.929 --> 00:51.713
You see what I did there?

00:51.805 --> 00:51.947
No.

00:52.011 --> 00:52.563
I was in character. 

00:52.633 --> 00:54.509
You see, that's the reason you should be the turkey.

00:56.309 --> 00:57.523
Maybe next year, I'll think about it.

00:57.612 --> 00:59.371
No, no, no! This is fun. Cluck, cluck!

00:59.683 --> 01:00.695
What happened to gobble, gobble?
