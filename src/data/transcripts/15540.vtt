OK. Now, we're ready to move on to the eyes.

00:05.003 --> 00:08.649
And the first thing I wanna talk about is eye contact.

00:09.263 --> 00:14.061
And eye contact is so important in interpersonal relationships.

00:14.543 --> 00:21.643
In fact, if someone is making more than sixty percent eye contact with you in a conversation,...

00:22.192 --> 00:25.974
...that means they're more interested in you than what you're saying.

00:26.353 --> 00:31.651
That's a little tip for you. Eye contact does a number of things.

00:31.758 --> 00:39.413
One, it secures the attention of the person that you're talking to or for the person who's talking to you.

00:39.986 --> 00:50.451
It also signals the nature of the relationship. Levels of intimacy have a whole lot to do with eye contact and comfort.

00:50.813 --> 00:55.985
If I'm very comfortable with you, I have no problem making eye contact with you. However,...

00:56.384 --> 00:59.857
...maybe you're my superior and you make me a little nervous,...

00:59.997 --> 01:03.491
...so I don't make quite as much eye contact with you.

01:03.633 --> 01:08.025
I can look away at times. It also shows interest.

01:08.157 --> 01:12.122
I'm interested in you. I wanna look at you. I wanna understand what you're saying...

01:12.493 --> 01:17.237
...rather than, "Hey, look at that girl. Hey, I wonder what they're doing. Hey, I'm listening."

01:17.779 --> 01:20.753
And you're constantly looking away, "I'm not really interested."

01:21.507 --> 01:23.843
It also can regulate the conversation.

01:24.289 --> 01:27.008
You're talking, I'm looking, I'm listening.

01:27.457 --> 01:31.231
I'm looking down now, because I disagree and I wanna say something.

01:31.695 --> 01:37.471
So, eye contact is very important. Now, let's talk about eye avoidance.
