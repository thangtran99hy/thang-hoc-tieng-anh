00:02.034 --> 00:06.467
This is Capoeira, an unusual combination of dance and martial arts.

00:07.315 --> 00:12.041
It was first performed by African slaves in Bahia Brazil in the 1800s.

00:13.079 --> 00:16.417
Slavery is long gone, but Capoeira is still around.

00:17.086 --> 00:20.486
Recently, social workers have started using this unusual sport...

00:20.741 --> 00:23.988
...to help in the education and social development of young people.

00:24.689 --> 00:28.082
An organization called Project Axe is leading the way.

00:28.514 --> 00:34.227
Project Axe operates an educational and social center in Bahia's capital city, Salvador.

00:34.828 --> 00:39.857
Mario Ribeiro de Freitas has been working and teaching Capoeira here for ten years.

00:40.215 --> 00:44.649
The organization uses Capoeira to help street kids and others who are at risk.

00:45.218 --> 00:48.094
Mario has practiced Capoeira for 25 years.

00:48.531 --> 00:51.778
He's a master, a combination of teacher and mentor.

00:54.187 --> 00:57.606
For these kids, Capoeira is important not just what it does for the body,...

00:58.102 --> 00:59.417
...but what it does for the mind and soul.

01:01.465 --> 01:04.173
And this Capoeira master knows from experience.

01:04.883 --> 01:08.647
Years ago, Mario was just another young boy from a bad neighborhood,...

01:09.025 --> 01:10.707
...but then Capoeira helped him.

01:17.941 --> 01:21.583
I studied with several Capoeira masters and learned a tremendous amount from them.

01:22.343 --> 01:25.296
I took positive aspects from their lives and applied them to mine.

01:25.961 --> 01:29.247
Not just to my teaching but to my whole life, to my family.

01:31.231 --> 01:34.713
Project Axe helps Salvador's young people who are on the street,...

01:34.932 --> 01:36.956
...in trouble or have drug problems.

01:37.670 --> 01:41.528
Axe workers make contact with many homeless kids out on the streets.

01:42.225 --> 01:46.270
Those who are interested must first agree to move home or go to a foster home.

01:46.938 --> 01:52.259
Then, at the center, they can learn music, dance or fashion design as well as Capoeira.

01:53.337 --> 01:55.865
They also help the kids with their basic education...

01:56.095 --> 01:58.498
...and make sure that the government knows about them.

01:59.273 --> 02:02.227
There are considerable numbers of street kids in parts of Brazil,...

02:02.533 --> 02:05.098
...some of whom have disappeared from official records.

02:07.016 --> 02:09.619
Mario also says that Capoeira teaches students...

02:09.688 --> 02:12.773
...to control their behavior and treat others with respect.

02:21.673 --> 02:25.289
Basically, I take what they have to offer, their body strength and their energy,...

02:25.791 --> 02:27.651
...and mold it by integrating them into the group.

02:34.513 --> 02:38.221
Once they're in the circle, which is the most sacred moment of the Capoeira process,...

02:38.792 --> 02:42.414
...I show them that there are norms, rules and limits within yourself...

02:42.827 --> 02:44.958
...and with others, that need to be followed.

02:50.765 --> 02:54.586
Hundreds of years ago, slaves in Brazil first practiced Capoeira...

02:54.690 --> 02:56.365
...as a way of opposing their owners.

02:56.707 --> 02:58.879
They made the fighting actions look like a dance...

02:59.059 --> 03:01.228
...so that their owners wouldn't know what they were doing.

03:01.805 --> 03:04.491
After slavery was abolished in 1888,...

03:04.671 --> 03:07.861
...Capoeira became popular for both amusement and sport.

03:08.231 --> 03:12.737
It also helped to raise ex-slaves' awareness of themselves as Afro-Brazilians.

03:13.140 --> 03:18.544
Today, Capoeira is helping street kids to give up drugs and crime and create new lives.

03:24.109 --> 03:26.044
My situation has totally changed.

03:26.554 --> 03:27.761
I was living on the street.

03:28.187 --> 03:28.815
I was homeless.

03:29.461 --> 03:32.731
I did a lot of drugs and I was involved in selling stolen cars.

03:33.487 --> 03:34.813
Axe got me off the streets.

03:35.514 --> 03:38.520
I'm studying Capoeira and I don't do that other stuff anymore.

03:39.226 --> 03:40.551
And I have an excellent master.

03:41.287 --> 03:42.123
My life is better.

03:43.635 --> 03:45.609
I was on the street begging for money.

03:46.243 --> 03:48.427
Then I heard about Axe and they offered me a place.

03:49.092 --> 03:54.988
I love Capoeira, especially the circle with two people giving respect and getting respect.

03:55.935 --> 03:57.897
We perform and learn to respect each other.

03:58.597 --> 04:03.589
Mario's students may be still a little unsure of their futures, but there are signs of progress.

04:03.953 --> 04:07.531
This class is preparing for a two-week trip to perform in Italy.

04:08.147 --> 04:11.102
It'll be a long journey but they've already come a long way.

04:11.491 --> 04:15.569
They've made it from the streets of Salvador to a safer, healthier place.
