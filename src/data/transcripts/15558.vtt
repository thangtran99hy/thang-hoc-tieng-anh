00:02.494 --> 00:05.500
The ancient city of Florence changes slowly.

00:06.561 --> 00:08.769
Its narrow stone streets are much the same...

00:08.857 --> 00:11.913
...as when the Medici family ruled more than 500 years ago.

00:13.553 --> 00:17.959
The city has seen the Renaissance, the Industrial Revolution and the World Wars.

00:19.052 --> 00:24.147
All have affected it, but in one factory here, the ways of the past remain the same.

00:24.721 --> 00:29.903
The Antico Setificio Fiorentino, the antique silk factory of Florence.

00:35.645 --> 00:40.544
Here, the continuous noise of the old mechanical looms brings one back to the past.

00:41.093 --> 00:45.747
This noisy 19th century looms create some of the world's finest silk fabrics...

00:45.855 --> 00:47.269
...for draperies and upholstery.

00:47.992 --> 00:50.169
But here, they are the new machines.

00:51.413 --> 00:55.178
In another part of the factory, one can find the real pieces of history:...

00:55.423 --> 00:57.419
...looms that have been around for centuries.

00:58.587 --> 01:04.364
Stefano Benelli is a weaver who makes the silk fabric that machines alone cannot create.

01:04.653 --> 01:10.250
He stands over a huge loom and work slowly and carefully, weaving one thread at a time.

01:13.149 --> 01:18.101
Above him, there are special paper cards that carry the designs for complicated patterns.

01:18.933 --> 01:23.664
These looms were built in 1780, and they apply the same principles of weaving...

01:23.783 --> 01:26.081
...that were used for hundreds of years before that.

01:26.525 --> 01:30.216
Everything is done like it was done in the ancient time.

01:30.529 --> 01:35.799
But we continue to do an evolution, continuously, we invent.

01:35.911 --> 01:38.570
We create continuously but using the old looms.

01:39.839 --> 01:43.518
After the Second World War, other Italian silk manufacturers...

01:43.619 --> 01:45.563
...threw away their slower hand looms...

01:45.895 --> 01:49.267
...that left the Setificio alone in the handmade silk industry.

01:50.009 --> 01:54.328
There is a big difference between industrially produced silk and handwoven silk.

01:54.715 --> 01:58.747
Industrially produced silk usually has 3,000 to 4,000 threads running...

01:58.812 --> 02:01.103
...in one direction on a full piece of fabric.

02:01.638 --> 02:06.647
The silk produced on the old hand looms has 12,000 threads in the same amount of space.

02:06.932 --> 02:09.599
That's up to four times the number of threads that are used.

02:10.067 --> 02:14.488
This affects the quality of the silk including how it looks, sounds and feels.

02:16.025 --> 02:19.621
Factory director Sabine Pretsch points out that the color of the fabric...

02:19.699 --> 02:21.459
...is affected by the weaving process.

02:21.861 --> 02:26.017
Handwoven threads don't twist, so they show the full range of color in the silk.

02:26.396 --> 02:31.369
Hand weaving also brings out a slight red color in a beautiful softened effect in the fabric.

02:31.679 --> 02:35.318
Handmade silk also makes a special noise and better holds its shape.

02:38.095 --> 02:40.056
Even before the weaving begins,...

02:40.241 --> 02:43.983
...the silk threads are processed on machines that are 150 years old.

02:45.458 --> 02:48.513
Then, the threads are prepared according to how they will be used.

02:51.035 --> 02:54.468
The threads used for the wide part of the fabric are called the weft.

02:56.799 --> 03:00.855
These are carefully placed on a bobbin so that the threads are not twisted.

03:03.036 --> 03:06.302
The threads used for the warp, or the long part of the fabric,...

03:06.485 --> 03:08.826
...are gathered together to create long groups.

03:09.389 --> 03:10.930
But again, not twisted.

03:14.295 --> 03:18.816
The fabrics made at the Setificio can't be found in stores or anywhere else.

03:19.219 --> 03:21.445
Every piece of cloth is custom made.

03:21.892 --> 03:25.259
But what may seem like difficult and boring work to some people...

03:25.407 --> 03:27.831
...is enjoyable to a craftsman like Benelli.

03:28.447 --> 03:34.292
In the mind, it's okay. Not stressful.

03:35.509 --> 03:38.181
It's been said that no other city has maintained...

03:38.302 --> 03:41.152
...the art and beauty of the Renaissance like Florence.

03:41.403 --> 03:46.186
It may be appropriate then, that here at the city's Antico Setificio Fiorentino,...

03:46.320 --> 03:50.935
...style and tradition come together in beautiful handwoven silk fabrics.

03:51.202 --> 03:55.631
It seems that the Setificio has perfected the art of making silk.
