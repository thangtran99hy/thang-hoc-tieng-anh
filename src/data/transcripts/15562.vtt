00:00.394 --> 00:01.205
I volunteered.

00:01.465 --> 00:02.165
I was drafted.

00:02.601 --> 00:03.195
I enlisted.

00:03.729 --> 00:04.401
I was nervous.

00:04.607 --> 00:05.665
And there I was in Asia.

00:06.048 --> 00:06.389
Europe.

00:06.680 --> 00:07.123
The Gulf.

00:07.405 --> 00:08.324
And I saw things.

00:08.525 --> 00:10.043
Incredible things.

00:10.331 --> 00:11.695
And people you never forget.

00:12.162 --> 00:12.828
I did my job.

00:13.333 --> 00:14.057
For my country.

00:14.319 --> 00:14.956
My buddies.

00:15.227 --> 00:16.485
For total strangers.

00:16.686 --> 00:17.473
And I was proud.

00:17.868 --> 00:18.622
So grateful.

00:19.046 --> 00:20.061
For my family.

00:20.607 --> 00:21.068
My freedom.

00:21.936 --> 00:25.137
For all who served and all who serve.

00:25.897 --> 00:27.969
We can never thank them enough.
