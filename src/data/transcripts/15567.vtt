And fast forward to a future where almost everything is different and new.

00:12.518 --> 00:14.969
...and more on achieving conclusion.

00:16.149 --> 00:20.620
Where systems integration and open source solutions coexist...

00:21.215 --> 00:26.332
...to meet the changing needs of our customers and their stakeholders.

It's a time of information systems.

00:30.901 --> 00:32.883

Technology's best.

00:47.823 --> 00:49.149
Industry's brightest.

00:49.898 --> 00:51.053
Personal commitment.

00:54.050 --> 00:54.886
Lockheed Martin,...
