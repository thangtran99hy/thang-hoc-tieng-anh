When Sicily's Mount Etna erupts, it really is a beautiful sight.

00:09.299 --> 00:12.247
It looks like an amazing, powerful fireworks show.

00:13.096 --> 00:16.029
But there's one audience that's watching for a different reason.

00:16.229 --> 00:20.111
A group of scientists have made watching Mount Etna their life's work.

00:20.492 --> 00:22.003
They're volcanologists.

00:23.209 --> 00:27.039
Salvatore Caffo is the main volcanologist on Mount Etna.

00:27.293 --> 00:32.826
From his office at Mount Etna National Park, Caffo has a good view of the power of the volcano.

00:33.135 --> 00:38.377
Caffo's responsibility is to watch the unpredictable mountain and keep records of its activity.

00:38.765 --> 00:45.217
Mount Etna, or simply Etna, is more than 10,000 feet high, which makes it Europe's highest active volcano.

00:46.141 --> 00:50.667
Caffo grew up in the city of Catania, less than 30 miles from Etna's craters.

00:51.138 --> 00:53.445
He was always extremely interested in the mountain.

00:54.010 --> 00:59.267
When he was just 11 years old, he knew that he wanted to make volcanoes an important part of his life.

01:00.281 --> 01:02.703
At the park, Caffo's task is important.

01:03.030 --> 01:06.339
He must work towards understanding the volcano's role on Earth.

01:06.799 --> 01:09.085
He must also help others to understand it.

01:09.677 --> 01:13.931
Mount Etna is a mountain where there's a very strong interaction between man and nature.

01:14.402 --> 01:16.082
And you can't leave that out of the equation.

01:18.131 --> 01:21.899
Mount Etna began to form 600,000 years ago.

01:22.227 --> 01:26.704
It started at the place where the African and Eurasian tectonic plates come together...

01:26.921 --> 01:28.671
...deep under the surface of the Earth.

01:30.059 --> 01:34.831
On Etna, there are more than 100 craters and cones in a huge volcanic area.

01:36.570 --> 01:42.111
These craters and cones indicate the places where gases and magma escape from under the Earth's crust.

01:44.245 --> 01:47.851
Today, thousands of people live on and around the volcano.

01:48.477 --> 01:52.933
For centuries, people have been farming the rich volcanic earth and growing their food there.

01:53.680 --> 01:57.620
Now, people also make money from tourists who come to see the eruptions.

02:00.967 --> 02:04.393
The town of Nicolosi is just 12 miles from the crater.

02:04.936 --> 02:07.886
The village was first built more than 800 years ago,...

02:08.145 --> 02:10.913
...but eruptions from Etna have destroyed it twice.

02:11.430 --> 02:15.623
The people who live there know that Nicolosi could be destroyed by Etna again.

02:16.039 --> 02:19.527
Yet, the town also benefits from being so close to the volcano.

02:20.031 --> 02:23.287
It's an interesting relationship between man and land.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.496
There is the risk, we know that.

02:34.258 --> 02:35.611
We are conscious of this risk.

02:35.993 --> 02:38.578
If it's destroyed, well, we rebuild.
