Who are your influences in your music?

00:03.206 --> 00:04.056
Whom do you get your influences from?

00:04.119 --> 00:07.669
Well, I get my influences from lots of different places.

00:08.248 --> 00:10.099
I write music pretty organically.

00:11.635 --> 00:13.567
I co-produce everything that I write,...

00:13.691 --> 00:19.299
...so usually me and whoever I'm working with, it's a very organic experience.

00:19.561 --> 00:23.880
Sometimes, I'll say, "Oh, I have this idea for a record..."

00:23.949 --> 00:28.821
"...called 'Beautiful, Dirty, Rich', and I'm feeling kind of like Prince vibe."
