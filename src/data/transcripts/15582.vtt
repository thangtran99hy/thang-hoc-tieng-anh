So it's Thanksgiving time and you are going to be hosting Thanksgiving dinner at your home.

00:04.175 --> 00:06.621
Well, my name is Lori Randall of Simply Divine Events...

00:06.767 --> 00:09.538
...and I'm going to tell you how to create your Thanksgiving dinner...

00:10.133 --> 00:11.660
...and how to plan a menu for that.

00:12.501 --> 00:15.379
The first thing that you are going to want to do is make sure that you plan ahead.

00:16.147 --> 00:19.099
Come up with a list and write down a menu of what you are going to be serving.

00:19.393 --> 00:24.344
You want to keep in mind your meats, your starches, your vegetables, having a nice salad...

00:25.151 --> 00:29.844
...and also take into consideration the guests that are coming and their dietary needs.

00:30.019 --> 00:33.977
So go ahead and find that out beforehand as you are planning your menu.

00:34.880 --> 00:38.460
Also, you want to make sure you shop ahead and get there before the Thanksgiving rush.

00:38.953 --> 00:40.889
And then you might also want to get your platters out.

00:42.129 --> 00:44.835
Go through your cabinets and get out all the platters that you might have...

00:45.195 --> 00:48.837
...and make sure that you have enough platters to accommodate all the food.

00:49.247 --> 00:51.501
And something you can even do is get a little sticky note...

00:51.623 --> 00:55.317
...stick it on the platters ahead of time and say that this is going on this...

00:55.423 --> 00:59.285
...that is going on that so you kind of make sure that you're all planned and organized.

00:59.874 --> 01:02.134
You're also going to want to go through your linen closet and make sure...

01:02.207 --> 01:05.341
...that you have a nice linen that might go with Thanksgiving.

01:06.063 --> 01:10.510
A nice champagne color, yellow, orange or maybe even a fall leaf pattern linen...

01:11.250 --> 01:12.585
...to kind of stick with your theme.

01:13.565 --> 01:16.067
Also, you want to go through all your dishes make sure they are all clean.

01:16.133 --> 01:20.755
If you're going to get your china out and make sure that's all clean and set aside.

01:21.213 --> 01:23.842
You might even want to set the table the night before, that way...

01:23.927 --> 01:27.415
...on the day of, you're not scrambling setting everything up.

01:27.993 --> 01:31.015
Also, keep in mind that you are going to probably have leftovers...

01:31.128 --> 01:33.221
...so make sure that you have some Tupperware,...

01:33.821 --> 01:35.895
...so that you can give some to guests to take some things home.

01:35.986 --> 01:38.304
Or you might want to invite everyone the next day to come back...

01:38.431 --> 01:41.241
...and have lunch and make turkey sandwiches.

01:42.143 --> 01:44.713
Make sure that you have your tin foil, your Saran wrap,...

01:45.548 --> 01:49.012
...all of that stuff as well when you are planning your Thanksgiving dinner.

01:49.294 --> 01:50.428
So, best of luck.

01:50.498 --> 01:51.587
I'm sure you are going to do great.

01:51.707 --> 01:55.845
Again, my name is Lori Randall with Simply Divine Events and I just told you...

01:55.908 --> 01:58.207
...how to create your Thanksgiving dinner.
