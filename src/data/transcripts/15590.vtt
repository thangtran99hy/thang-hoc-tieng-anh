00:01.068 --> 00:04.717
Finally tonight, NewsHour economics correspondent Paul Solman...

00:05.151 --> 00:11.156
...reports on the art of doing a difficult negotiation during tough economic times.

00:11.510 --> 00:16.090
That's part of his ongoing reporting on Making Sense of financial news.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.761
Can we lower the interest rates that I pay?

00:18.880 --> 00:22.165
Can we can we make the mortgage extend for longer?

00:22.231 --> 00:26.591
At Harvard Law School learning to negotiate, student Erum Sattar...

00:26.891 --> 00:31.109
...had agreed to role-play a typical debt - hobbled homeowner these days.

00:31.208 --> 00:34.535
I don't see how it's in your interest to foreclose this property.

00:35.125 --> 00:37.495
Is there nothing that we can do to work this deal out,...

00:37.683 --> 00:41.739
...something that helps you and it helps, you know, us stay in the house?

00:42.019 --> 00:44.967
Michael Aktipis played the banker who won't budge.

00:45.416 --> 00:48.550
I would love to help you out, but how can I make an exception for you,...

00:48.833 --> 00:53.411
...when I have hundreds of people every day contacting me, asking me to do the same thing?

00:53.892 --> 00:56.886
If he doesn't have that authority, who does?

00:57.357 --> 00:57.811
Ask him.

00:58.104 --> 01:01.987
Coaching and critiquing, negotiation guru Robert Mnookin.

01:02.159 --> 01:07.081
The words you use, the tone you use, your language;

01:07.215 --> 01:11.273
...it all matters, because it could affect how the other person reacts.

01:11.721 --> 01:15.108
Mnookin is the author of a new book with a timely thesis.

01:15.261 --> 01:20.831
"Bargaining with the Devil" is a book about the most difficult kinds of negotiations...

01:21.287 --> 01:23.837
...where your adversary is someone you don't trust,...

01:24.891 --> 01:26.584
...who you think may be out to harm you.

01:26.757 --> 01:28.057
You may even think they're evil. 

01:28.596 --> 01:30.574
Erum and Michael, you know all about the case.

01:30.780 --> 01:36.076
But whether it's your loan servicer or a cousin demanding grandma's engagement ring;...

01:36.541 --> 01:38.990
...take the economic approach, says Mnookin.

01:39.418 --> 01:40.791
Try to make a trade.

01:40.953 --> 01:41.738
Renegotiate.

01:41.987 --> 01:48.079
The metaphor I use is, the carnivore is eager to trade his broccoli...

01:48.391 --> 01:51.326
...for a lamb chop owned by a vegetarian.

01:52.068 --> 01:54.254
It's that they have different preferences...

01:54.511 --> 01:58.782
...that allows you to make both sides better off through trades.

01:58.932 --> 02:01.170
In other words, a win-win solution.

02:01.293 --> 02:03.707
Better for the bank and better for us.

02:04.229 --> 02:06.705
Which of course, sounds a lot easier than it is to achieve.

02:07.131 --> 02:08.999
Emotions are often running very high,...

02:09.907 --> 02:14.577
...and it's very hard for what I call the "Mr. Spock" in yourself:...

02:15.038 --> 02:19.469
...the cool, dispassionate, rational actor to think things through.

02:19.716 --> 02:22.281
All I can tell you is, you have to pay $2,000 a month.

02:22.533 --> 02:27.463
As if to prove Mnookin's point, emotions ran high in our mortgage negotiation,...

02:27.890 --> 02:28.875
...which wasn't even real.

02:29.102 --> 02:31.318
We're literally going to have to leave this house if you don't help us.

02:31.410 --> 02:32.587
I mean, we are desperate.

02:33.360 --> 02:33.938
Go for it.

02:34.303 --> 02:36.739
Good luck ever getting a mortgage again.

02:36.891 --> 02:38.087
"Aha!" says Mnookin.

02:38.577 --> 02:42.436
Michael's warning is a typical case of BATNA bashing.

02:42.999 --> 02:49.175
BATNA is negotiation jargon for your best alternative to a negotiating agreement.

02:49.748 --> 02:52.131
In other words, if I can't make a deal with you,...

02:53.828 --> 02:57.561
...what is my best alternative away from the table that doesn't require...

02:58.826 --> 02:59.890
...any help from you at all?

03:01.121 --> 03:06.355
BATNA bashing is to say to someone, "Your alternative is terrible!"

03:06.928 --> 03:11.915
It's to try to remind the other person how bad their alternative is.

03:12.270 --> 03:14.845
Which is just how our mock session played out.
