00:00.031 --> 00:01.090
Your credit is going to be shot.

00:01.445 --> 00:04.189
You're dreaming if you think that you can realistically walk away...

00:04.431 --> 00:06.593
...and get another mortgage, and take care of your kids.

00:07.196 --> 00:09.637
So, either find some way to pay this mortgage,...

00:10.035 --> 00:12.169
...or go ahead and walk away and see what happens.

00:12.767 --> 00:15.420
I mean, we're going to have to, right? Because you're leaving us no choice?

00:16.132 --> 00:21.155
Sattar actually broke down at this point though this was a pretend negotiation.

00:21.272 --> 00:22.245
Our conversation is over.

00:22.355 --> 00:22.959
So, why?

00:23.051 --> 00:28.509
It was just that he painted this really bleak picture that my life was, I mean, it was all bad.

00:28.615 --> 00:30.041
No one would ever give me any money.

00:30.105 --> 00:30.912
I'd have to leave my house.

00:31.571 --> 00:32.602
It was horrendous.

00:32.850 --> 00:36.653
But, look, says Mnookin, you have got to not take it personally.

00:37.445 --> 00:39.038
When a second pair of students,...

00:39.149 --> 00:43.695
...David Baumwoll and Jared Craft, stepped into the roles of homeowner and banker...

00:43.781 --> 00:44.293
How can I help you?

00:44.470 --> 00:45.168
Hi. It's a pleasure to...

00:45.291 --> 00:47.355
...rationality trumped emotion.

00:47.622 --> 00:51.662
The reason I'm coming to you today is to figure out if there is anything we can do together...

00:51.721 --> 00:53.716
...to come up with some agreement...

00:54.200 --> 00:57.450
...where you're getting paid, you don't have to go through all the problems...

00:57.829 --> 01:00.777
...associated with foreclosures, all those costs associated with it,...

01:01.130 --> 01:02.346
...and I get to keep my house.

01:02.674 --> 01:06.581
You could respond by asking a question. Well, what do you have in mind?

01:07.495 --> 01:09.286
Okay, so why don't you give me a number?

01:09.386 --> 01:11.081
What can you pay every month? 

01:11.227 --> 01:12.987
And I will take a look at it,...

01:13.063 --> 01:16.255
...and I will see if we have the discretion to help you out.

01:16.716 --> 01:18.379
Well, because I want to make the most of our time here,...

01:18.843 --> 01:21.068
...I did some research beforehand and ran the numbers.

01:21.556 --> 01:29.999
My approach is always to see if I can lead and persuade the other side to engage in problem-solving.

01:30.561 --> 01:35.774
Many more things are negotiable than people assume are negotiable.

01:36.194 --> 01:42.134
A key principle is you have got to be able to dispassionately try to think through...

01:43.193 --> 01:47.439
...in a circumstance where your emotions are likely to want to take over.

01:48.461 --> 01:50.247
What are my alternatives?

01:51.170 --> 01:54.932
What are the costs and benefits of different courses of action?

01:55.710 --> 01:57.381
And that's very challenging.

01:57.765 --> 02:00.710
But it can also be very rewarding, says Mnookin.

02:00.863 --> 02:03.757
And I really look forward to working with you on a better deal.

02:04.105 --> 02:06.621
Weighing costs against benefits.

02:07.207 --> 02:09.270
The essence of economics.
