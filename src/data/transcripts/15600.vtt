Hi, I'm Robert Downey Jr.!

00:01.866 --> 00:06.964
Check out the exclusive new trailer for my upcoming film, "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows",...

00:07.308 --> 00:09.271
...only on iTunes trailers.

00:19.632 --> 00:21.844
Please sit. Put your money on the table.

00:23.911 --> 00:24.334
Welcome.

00:27.405 --> 00:29.760
The cards can illuminate your future.

00:32.774 --> 00:34.055
I have a feeling you're in danger.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.888
Actually, I prefer to read your fortune.

00:40.329 --> 00:43.315
I see that your next client is here to kill you.

00:52.086 --> 00:53.799
Oh, how I've missed you, Holmes.

01:00.431 --> 01:03.615
I see that your web of conspiracy has expanded.

01:04.773 --> 01:07.487
I'm knee-deep in the single, most important case of my career.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.541
The clues point in one direction,...

01:10.039 --> 01:11.989
...Professor James Moriarty.

01:12.817 --> 01:14.630
Are you sure you want to play this game?

01:16.449 --> 01:18.126
I'm afraid you'd lose.

01:24.661 --> 01:27.815
I'll agree it's not my best disguise, but I have to make do.

01:37.573 --> 01:38.923
Didn't see this on the cards, did you?

01:50.281 --> 01:51.473
What are we doing down here?

01:56.478 --> 01:57.577
We are waiting.

02:08.417 --> 02:09.030
Make it count.

02:15.777 --> 02:17.379
I'm on my honeymoon!

02:23.741 --> 02:24.686
Get that out of my face.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.168
It's not in your face. It's in my hand.

02:26.258 --> 02:28.443
Get what's in your hand out of my face.
