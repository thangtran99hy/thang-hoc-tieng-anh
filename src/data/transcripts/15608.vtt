Lonely Planet travel writer Katharina Kane is in Ethiopia.

00:15.339 --> 00:21.015
She's heading outside Harar's ancient city walls to see a man who's famous for feeding hyenas.

00:21.259 --> 00:25.509
I've never heard of anybody attempting to feed hyenas, it just seems a little crazy.

00:26.254 --> 00:27.022
Why would you do that?

00:27.424 --> 00:30.050
You know, aren't they scavengers and they're supposed to like eat dead meat?

00:30.168 --> 00:31.564
So, obviously I want to see this.

00:40.842 --> 00:44.483
The story goes that hyena feeding began 50 years ago...

00:44.689 --> 00:46.983
...to keep them from entering the city walls.

00:47.519 --> 00:50.724
Now it becomes a tourist attraction for a lot of Ethiopians.

00:52.781 --> 00:55.624
I get the impression that they're his friends, he's calling them by name.

00:55.841 --> 01:01.689
Amalis was just saying to me that they're so tame, they just walk through town sometimes, right?

01:01.941 --> 01:02.409
Is that right?

01:04.335 --> 01:08.906
I always thought hyenas were like, you know, the ugliest creatures that actually existed,...

01:08.985 --> 01:12.369
...but when you're sitting up close, they're actually strangely beautiful.

01:12.756 --> 01:13.647
Come on, come on, come on.
