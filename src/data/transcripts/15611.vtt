00:10.701 --> 00:14.307
Last year, we raved about 2K11, and for good reason.

00:14.790 --> 00:17.398
It was the best basketball game we had ever played.

00:18.230 --> 00:18.713
Was.

00:19.348 --> 00:21.820
This year, 2K Sports brings their A game again,...

00:22.143 --> 00:25.949
...and amazingly, NBA 2k12 is better in every single way.

00:37.659 --> 00:40.762
It's cliche to say a sports game looks like a television broadcast,...

00:40.934 --> 00:43.021
...but that's totally the case in 2K12.

00:43.467 --> 00:46.820
In addition to the cameras, lighting and overall visual sheen,...

00:47.136 --> 00:51.179
...the game has commercial breaks, ads for other games, intro cinematics...

00:51.353 --> 00:54.546
...and all new menus that make it feel like a Thursday night game.

00:54.895 --> 00:58.549
All that's missing is Charles Barkley talking nonsense at the halftime report.

00:58.896 --> 01:00.886
It seems silly to talk about the main menus,...

01:01.285 --> 01:04.139
...but NBA 2K12 puts everything right in front of you.

01:04.781 --> 01:08.839
Your association, My Player, Quick Games and NBA's Greatest...

01:09.039 --> 01:12.911
...are all right there and ready to go without having to find and load them.

01:13.617 --> 01:16.489
The character models are similar but many have been improved.

01:16.747 --> 01:21.224
There are fewer weird-looking faces, but Steve Nash still looks like an emaciated woman.

01:21.929 --> 01:26.691
The number of animations have increased and your favorite stars act like they do in an actual court.

01:27.315 --> 01:32.720
Signature dunks, mocap shot animations and victory celebrations match up nearly perfectly.

01:33.560 --> 01:37.997
The noticeable changes are in the crowd and bench players, who react more realistically.

01:38.607 --> 01:41.709
Even the mascots add a new level of realism to the experience.

01:50.891 --> 01:56.403
2K12 keeps that same core gameplay that made the last game great, but with improved controls.

01:56.809 --> 02:00.066
The new stick shooting mechanics allows a much broader range of shots,...

02:00.428 --> 02:02.509
...really giving you control of the plays.

02:03.155 --> 02:06.659
Defense is still tight without being as noticeably cheap as last year.

02:07.155 --> 02:10.658
They will still kick your ass and pound you if you try to sneak a bad pass by them.

02:11.126 --> 02:14.735
The franchise mode, one of the strongest in sports games, is now online,...

02:15.035 --> 02:17.721
...allowing you to compete against friends for an entire season.

02:18.403 --> 02:22.687
And My Player got a significant improvement. It can mean a much faster mode to get into.

02:23.402 --> 02:25.103
Instead of struggling in the D League,...

02:25.302 --> 02:28.579
...you head to the NBA quickly and get into the real meat of the mode.

02:28.872 --> 02:30.705
Then there's NBA's Greatest.

02:30.993 --> 02:33.803
Remember how awesome those Jordan challenges were last year?

02:34.189 --> 02:36.039
Well, now you get to play not only as Jordan,...

02:36.379 --> 02:40.252
...but as Magic, Larry Bird, the Mailman, Hakeem and more.

02:40.617 --> 02:43.722
The NBA's Greatest mode is more varied and simplified,...

02:44.115 --> 02:46.195
...allowing you to enjoy some great matchups.

02:46.632 --> 02:51.115
You just have to win and not try to get a certain number of rebounds or points like last time.

02:52.047 --> 02:55.343
And they look amazing. Check out the black-and-white Bill Russell.

02:56.006 --> 03:00.401
For PS3 fans, there are move controls, so check out our full review for impressions on that.

03:00.971 --> 03:04.401
Fans cheer me on every night and my great teammates feeding me the ball,...

03:04.551 --> 03:05.883
...only great things can happen.

03:06.136 --> 03:07.430
Great things, my man!

03:09.613 --> 03:14.817
NBA 2K12 has dethroned it's predecessor as the best basketball game of all time.

03:15.343 --> 03:18.315
I was skeptical about how they can improve over last year,...

03:18.494 --> 03:22.023
...but 2K Sports made an extremely fun, varied basketball game.

03:22.647 --> 03:24.957
Each mode alone is worth picking the game up for.

03:27.388 --> 03:29.368
And all of them together are a slam dunk.

03:30.156 --> 03:34.123
