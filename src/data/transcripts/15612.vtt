Hello, welcome to Michael's Better Business English.

00:04.210 --> 00:10.953
This month, we're looking at a topic that many Japanese people find difficult to handle: Compliments.

00:11.786 --> 00:13.755
Now, especially in the workplace,...

00:14.065 --> 00:18.454
...most Japanese people don't pay or receive compliments so often.

00:19.368 --> 00:23.007
However in some cultures such as American culture,...

00:23.387 --> 00:28.208
...people often use compliments as a positive conversation starter,...

00:28.994 --> 00:31.981
...or to build a friendship with their co-workers.

00:33.129 --> 00:38.036
So, what should you do if you want to pay a compliment to somebody in your office?

00:39.156 --> 00:42.151
First, we often say something personal,...

00:42.417 --> 00:45.523
...a personal feeling about the object of the compliment.

00:46.413 --> 00:49.216
For example, "I really like that shirt on you."

00:49.421 --> 00:50.748
"It really suits you."

00:52.297 --> 00:54.665
Also, we might say how it appears.

00:55.409 --> 00:57.953
For example, "I really like that shirt."

00:58.223 --> 01:00.060
"It looks very smart."

01:02.056 --> 01:06.355
When receiving compliments, here there are two things we could do.

01:07.233 --> 01:10.851
When receiving, the first thing is we could give some detail.

01:11.965 --> 01:14.999
For example, "Thanks! I'm glad you like it."

01:15.393 --> 01:17.403
"I bought it last week in New York."

01:18.447 --> 01:21.503
This extra detail helps develop the conversation.

01:23.196 --> 01:27.344
Or if you wanted to be modest, you could downplay the compliment.

01:28.145 --> 01:33.680
We normally do this by focusing on how we feel about the object of the compliment,...

01:34.137 --> 01:35.839
...rather than the object itself.

01:36.631 --> 01:40.629
For example, "Thanks! I really like that design."

01:40.927 --> 01:42.023
"That's why I bought it."

01:42.967 --> 01:47.583
This is a subtle way to change the topic a little bit from the compliment itself.

01:48.933 --> 01:52.145
So, now you know how to pay and receive compliments.

01:52.670 --> 01:54.156
Thank you and good luck!
