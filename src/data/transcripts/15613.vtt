00:00.161 --> 00:04.559
Well, let's start off with the question that's been bothering me.

00:05.325 --> 00:06.377
I can't figure out what your name means.

00:07.722 --> 00:09.537
I'm trying to look it up on the Internet, I can't find it.

00:09.631 --> 00:10.205
What does Mohombi mean?

00:11.021 --> 00:12.069
Do you know why you can't find it?

00:12.214 --> 00:16.022
Because I'm probably, I think I'm the second person...

00:16.747 --> 00:18.549
...in the world? With the name? Really?

00:18.659 --> 00:18.950
Yeah.

00:20.245 --> 00:22.646
So does it have a specific meaning?

00:22.715 --> 00:27.015
It does have a specific meaning in two languages.

00:27.131 --> 00:35.517
In one of them Mohombi Nzasi, that's my first and my second name, means "lightning and thunder."

00:36.383 --> 00:38.693
And so Mohombi means "lightning" in one language...

00:39.709 --> 00:42.411
...and in another language it means "chief."

00:43.799 --> 00:45.727
Like the chief of a tribe.

00:46.191 --> 00:47.080
What are the two languages?

00:47.723 --> 00:55.636
Kikongo and Swahili.

00:55.916 --> 01:02.124
Okay, and the thunder part, what does that mean in the other language?

01:02.291 --> 01:04.259
One of them means "chief," what does the other mean?

01:05.367 --> 01:07.987
Lightning.

01:08.711 --> 01:10.458
Lightning and thunder, Mohombi Nzasi.

01:10.879 --> 01:11.703
Wow, that's really cool.

01:12.258 --> 01:13.501
Who's the first person named Mohombi?

01:14.533 --> 01:15.311
The second person.

01:15.399 --> 01:15.810
You're the second?

01:15.916 --> 01:19.768
No, the second person is actually one of my nephews.

01:19.922 --> 01:20.279
Oh!

01:20.431 --> 01:20.641
Yeah.

01:20.863 --> 01:21.265
Wow!

01:21.526 --> 01:23.417
So that's the good impression I had on my sister.

01:23.511 --> 01:24.017
I guess so!

01:25.885 --> 01:29.252
And so you have 16 brothers and sisters, right?

01:29.715 --> 01:32.718
Yes, we are, in total, 15.

01:34.407 --> 01:35.121
Counting you, 15.

01:35.417 --> 01:36.963
How many nephews and nieces do you have?

01:37.351 --> 01:38.025
Oh, 25.

01:40.275 --> 01:40.980
So, wow!

01:41.053 --> 01:42.282
Crazy for Christmas, you know.

01:42.363 --> 01:43.163
Very expensive.

01:43.908 --> 01:47.693
Yeah, you have to have a pretty big turkey to feed 40 people.

01:48.654 --> 01:49.171
That's right!

01:49.317 --> 01:49.756
Wow!
