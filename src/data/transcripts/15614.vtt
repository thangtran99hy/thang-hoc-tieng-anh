00:00.011 --> 00:00.379
Thank you.

00:00.539 --> 00:03.687
So it's obviously been number one for how long?

00:04.695 --> 00:08.181
It was number one on the actual charts for three weeks.

00:08.853 --> 00:12.351
I mean, it was on radio for a while.

00:13.156 --> 00:14.231
Are you famous now?

00:17.620 --> 00:18.066
I don't know.

00:18.134 --> 00:19.706
I mean, New Zealand's so small.

00:20.021 --> 00:23.211
And I don't feel like anyone can be too famous in New Zealand...

00:23.293 --> 00:24.877
...because it's such a small place.

00:24.959 --> 00:26.858
I mean, we only have four million people there.

00:27.533 --> 00:28.195
Four million?

00:28.383 --> 00:29.616
Yeah, in the whole country.

00:30.866 --> 00:32.315
So it's really small.

00:33.279 --> 00:35.128
So, I mean, I don't know, I'm not sure.

00:36.849 --> 00:41.457
I see, I wasn't quite sure about the thing written here.

00:42.368 --> 00:45.086
Can you tell us how it got started?

00:45.166 --> 00:47.000
I mean, these sheets thing.

00:48.178 --> 00:51.767
The song was on the Internet first...

00:52.161 --> 00:55.114
...and then somebody spread the word.

00:55.186 --> 00:59.421
How about this TV2?

00:59.511 --> 00:59.908
Yes.

01:00.357 --> 01:00.922
Can you tell us?

01:00.999 --> 01:04.813
Ah, yes. So I released the album online for free.

01:05.583 --> 01:08.934
And then it was up for about three months.

01:09.534 --> 01:14.349
And during that time, I think within the first couple of weeks, the local TV station...

01:14.429 --> 01:21.725
...and Channel Two heard the track "Love, Love, Love" and picked it up for the TV2 thing.

01:22.191 --> 01:24.092
So they used it for the brand commercials.

01:24.164 --> 01:29.718
From there it went to radio and it got bigger that way.

01:30.729 --> 01:40.653
Okay, and it also sort of really healed the people who got hurt and wounded,...

01:40.720 --> 01:43.744
...I mean, emotionally wounded after the earthquake.

01:45.566 --> 01:49.977
I think it came out at the right time for the New Zealand public...

01:50.058 --> 01:55.269
...because at the time that it got big in New Zealand, this quake happened.

01:56.395 --> 01:58.394
And it was just an uplifting song for us.

01:58.505 --> 02:00.017
It was good for New Zealand in the end.

02:01.179 --> 02:04.511
It's really uplifting and it's sort of forward-looking.

02:05.067 --> 02:05.327
Yeah.

02:05.947 --> 02:07.213
People like it, that's why.
