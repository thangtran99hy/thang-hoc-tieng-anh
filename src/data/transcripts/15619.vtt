ï»¿Google Apps is a customizable package of workplace applications,...

00:04.278 --> 00:07.859
....and the communications hub is Gmail, our web-based email program.

00:08.682 --> 00:10.344
Let's explore some unique features...

00:10.420 --> 00:13.878
...that make Gmail users more connected, efficient and productive.

00:14.575 --> 00:18.425
Mary is an employee at Altostrat, and here is her Gmail inbox.

00:18.954 --> 00:21.059
You may notice something unusual.

00:21.445 --> 00:23.267
She doesn't have to battle against spam,...

00:23.467 --> 00:27.030
...thanks to Gmail's powerful spam, virus, and phishing protection.

00:27.547 --> 00:30.982
What's more, Google Apps Premier edition allows administrators...

00:31.057 --> 00:34.163
...to create custom filters for inbound and outbound mail,...

00:34.625 --> 00:37.350
...a further measure to help cut out unwanted messages.

00:37.961 --> 00:42.271
When a message is detected as a piece of spam, it's siphoned into Mary's spam folder...

00:42.366 --> 00:46.553
...and deleted automatically after 30 days, meaning she never even has to look at it.

00:46.893 --> 00:50.030
But even if Gmail didn't automatically protect Mary from spam,...

00:50.412 --> 00:52.865
...she probably wouldn't ever run out of storage space...

00:52.991 --> 00:57.726
...because Google Apps Premier edition includes 25 gigabytes of email storage per user,...

00:58.042 --> 01:01.377
...which is about 50 times larger than the standard corporate inbox.

01:01.700 --> 01:06.365
So, Mary never has to delete an important message, and every message is accessible...

01:06.471 --> 01:09.153
...through Gmail's fast and comprehensive message search,...

01:09.590 --> 01:12.113
...which helps Mary instantly find past emails.

01:12.479 --> 01:16.652
Let's say Mary has a meeting tomorrow with her manager to discuss last year's sales figures,...

01:17.057 --> 01:20.887
...and she remembers that David emailed her a relevant spreadsheet a few weeks back.

01:22.076 --> 01:23.945
Even if Mary archived David's email,...

01:24.328 --> 01:27.981
... she can find his message by typing a few words into the Gmail search box.

01:28.995 --> 01:32.277
Working quickly is also made easier with message conversations.

01:33.335 --> 01:36.596
Let's say Mary sends an email to her team about planning a team dinner,...

01:37.073 --> 01:39.129
...and then her first message turns into a handful...

01:39.196 --> 01:41.708
...after people respond with their restaurant preferences.

01:43.123 --> 01:47.021
Instead of sorting through individual emails that are scattered throughout her inbox,...

01:47.417 --> 01:50.655
...Mary can find all the replies about the team dinner in a single thread,...

01:51.071 --> 01:54.339
...which are automatically grouped together as a single line in her inbox.

01:54.895 --> 01:58.704
Because Gmail automatically groups related emails into conversations,...

01:59.110 --> 02:03.153
...Mary can follow the thread chronologically and see how the discussion progressed,...

02:03.473 --> 02:05.033
...all together on a single page.

02:05.789 --> 02:08.550
Another efficiency booster in Gmail is colored labels.

02:08.781 --> 02:10.801
To quickly spot emails from her teammates,...

02:10.986 --> 02:15.538
...Mary has created filters that put an orange label on all incoming messages from them.

02:15.766 --> 02:19.473
With a quick glance at her inbox, she can see if her teammates have emailed her.

02:19.676 --> 02:22.389
And for her most important, top priority messages,...

02:22.774 --> 02:25.849
... Mary assigns a star, so she can easily return to them later.

02:26.833 --> 02:30.226
But we all know that important information isn't just shared in email,...

02:30.557 --> 02:32.371
...it's often sent by instant message.

02:32.571 --> 02:34.763
Since Gmail's integrated with Google Talk,...

02:35.030 --> 02:37.560
...Mary can email and chat from the same interface.

02:38.471 --> 02:41.972
And when she needs to find information from a past IM conversation,...

02:42.402 --> 02:46.609
...she uses the same Gmail search box to find both email and chat results.

02:47.267 --> 02:49.956
There's more we could show you, but why not see for yourself.

02:50.549 --> 02:51.892
