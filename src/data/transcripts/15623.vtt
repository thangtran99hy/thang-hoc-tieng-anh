00:00.369 --> 00:00.871
It's gone!

00:01.456 --> 00:05.845
Zack may be walking but he faces another barrier to further progress.

00:10.557 --> 00:15.593
Imagine what it's like for an infant to understand so very little of what's going on around it...

00:15.935 --> 00:18.159
Hello. I'm looking for some lamps.

00:18.258 --> 00:21.247
...to feel lost and excluded from the social world.

00:26.543 --> 00:29.352
The closest we get to it is a holiday abroad.

00:31.693 --> 00:33.457
These are too old; I want something new.

00:44.758 --> 00:48.809
Trouble is, you can only get so far with mime and pointing.

00:48.967 --> 00:49.247
No?

00:49.343 --> 00:49.517
No.

00:49.669 --> 00:51.051
Will you take me to the pyramids?

00:54.889 --> 00:56.604
Yes, okay.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.836
As a child, one thing you lack is...

01:16.899 --> 01:20.100
...an accurate way of explaining your desires, exactly what you feel;...

01:20.857 --> 01:25.846
...what you really want or any way really of telling your parents what to get for you.

01:26.441 --> 01:29.159
What you need of course are words.

01:33.550 --> 01:38.076
Every human culture has depended on them, be they spoken or written...

01:38.691 --> 01:40.124
...like these hieroglyphics.

01:43.281 --> 01:47.964
Words and language are the most important thing a child will ever learn.

01:50.001 --> 01:54.216
Not just words to describe things you can point at like sand or rock,...

01:54.558 --> 01:56.473
...but words to describe abstract things:...

01:57.220 --> 02:01.155
...your past, your future, your fears, your hopes;...

02:01.821 --> 02:04.613
...words to describe discoveries and ideas...

02:05.371 --> 02:06.811
...to communicate into other people...

02:08.188 --> 02:13.092
...down the generations, ever expanding the wealth of human knowledge and experience.

02:30.307 --> 02:33.794
The whole world we have built is built upon language.

02:34.649 --> 02:36.899
And yet, it all begins so simply.
