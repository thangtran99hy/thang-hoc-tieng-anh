00:03.582 --> 00:07.487
It remains unclear how and when Muammar Gadhafi died Thursday.

00:07.865 --> 00:10.319
The body ultimately ended up in cold storage...

00:10.395 --> 00:15.215
...a day after national transitional forces reportedly first captured him alive.

00:15.705 --> 00:19.271
As word continued to spread around the world of Gadhafi's demise,...

00:19.555 --> 00:22.340
...many thought the longtime leader got what he deserved.

00:24.180 --> 00:26.843
They should kill and torture him like he did to them.

00:27.371 --> 00:30.401
It should be his destiny like he tortured his own people.

00:32.079 --> 00:36.405
But Tom Porteous with Human Rights Watch sees the outcome of Gadhafi's death differently.

00:36.720 --> 00:38.619
It's not really a question about what he deserved.

00:38.709 --> 00:43.595
It's a question about the path that the new Libya wants to take.

00:43.954 --> 00:47.009
Libyan officials say that Gadhafi died while being transported...

00:47.145 --> 00:49.011
...after being plucked from a drainage pipe,...

00:49.461 --> 00:51.461
...but reports and footage cast doubts...

00:51.799 --> 00:55.515
... showing Gadhafi was more likely killed in the chaos during his capture.

00:55.834 --> 00:58.153
Porteous says that there needs to be an investigation.

00:58.349 --> 01:03.967
And it's absolutely essential that the new authorities send a very strong signal...

01:04.113 --> 01:08.832
...that they intend to take the path of building a new Libya...

01:08.941 --> 01:11.978
...based on human rights and respect for the rule of law.

01:12.104 --> 01:13.787
And this is a chance to do so.

01:15.866 --> 01:19.574
He says that the people who took up arms against Gadhafi said they were doing it...

01:19.679 --> 01:22.585
...in part to build a new Libya based on pluralism...

01:22.710 --> 01:25.181
...and a respect for human rights and the rule of law.

01:25.579 --> 01:29.509
If the interim government fails to investigate, Porteous says it runs the danger...

01:29.689 --> 01:32.353
...that the new Libya will be acting similar to the old.
