00:13.653 --> 00:16.467
Cheese rolling has been a tradition in the town of Brockworth...

00:16.561 --> 00:18.118
...since the early 1800s.

00:21.040 --> 00:25.152
First, the competitors come together at the top of Cooper's Hill and wait.

00:27.255 --> 00:30.531
Then, someone pushes a very large wheel of cheese...

00:30.615 --> 00:31.685
...down the steep slope.

00:32.047 --> 00:32.684
And after that?

00:33.175 --> 00:34.308
Things get a little wild.

00:36.355 --> 00:39.007
The cheese may reach up to 40 miles per hour.

00:39.551 --> 00:41.291
The competitors go pretty fast, too.

00:41.860 --> 00:43.577
The first one to the bottom wins.

00:44.172 --> 00:44.895
What's the prize?

00:45.246 --> 00:47.140
The wheel of cheese, of course.

00:51.131 --> 00:54.171
The first winner of the day is Craig Brown, a pub worker.

00:54.671 --> 00:55.983
Craig's plan was simple.

00:56.933 --> 00:59.576
Keep going, and try to get your balance back...

00:59.662 --> 01:01.319
...because it's steeper than you could ever think.

01:01.385 --> 01:03.481
You'd have to run down there to really believe how steep it is.

01:03.983 --> 01:06.367
Many people enjoy the cheese rolling races.

01:06.785 --> 01:08.591
However, they can be dangerous.

01:08.921 --> 01:12.996
A few years ago, 30 people were injured in an accident at a race.

01:13.502 --> 01:15.781
One of the cheeses rolled down the hill too quickly...

01:15.865 --> 01:18.060
...and unexpectedly went into the crowd.

01:18.707 --> 01:22.175
Now, the competition route has crash barriers to protect the crowd.

01:23.206 --> 01:25.109
It's not just spectators who get injured;...

01:25.503 --> 01:26.834
...competitors do as well...

01:27.263 --> 01:29.971
...especially when it's cold or there hasn't been much rain.

01:30.529 --> 01:31.933
It's when the ground is really hard.

01:32.937 --> 01:34.022
That's when the injuries are going to happen.

01:36.260 --> 01:39.881
Craig's plan to just keep on going failed in his second race.

01:41.530 --> 01:42.333
At the time,...

01:42.465 --> 01:45.476
...he was trying to get the competition's version of a double play,...

01:45.822 --> 01:47.591
...winning two cheese wheels in one day.

01:49.361 --> 01:51.211
So, what drives these runners?

01:51.569 --> 01:52.295
Are they crazy?

01:53.112 --> 01:55.162
One cheese runner thinks they may be.

01:55.671 --> 01:56.411
It is dangerous.

01:57.067 --> 02:00.036
If I'm running down,...

02:01.718 --> 02:02.927
...must be crazy.

02:03.525 --> 02:05.574
Yeah, I must be crazy.

02:06.804 --> 02:08.871
These cheese racers may be crazy,...

02:09.058 --> 02:11.644
...but year after year the crowds keep on cheering,...

02:11.752 --> 02:13.503
...and the competitors keep on running.

02:13.815 --> 02:14.685
Is it for the fame?

02:15.031 --> 02:15.990
Is it for the fun?

02:16.310 --> 02:18.888
We may never know, but you can be sure of one thing:...

02:19.202 --> 02:20.667
...it's more than just cheese...

02:20.751 --> 02:24.586
...that makes people want to win Brockworth's annual cheese rolling race.
