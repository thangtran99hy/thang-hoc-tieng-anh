When a man has a heart attack, it's often because of a blocked artery.

00:14.438 --> 00:17.119
An x-ray of blood vessels, an angiogram,...

00:17.485 --> 00:20.889
...can usually spot a blockage caused by a buildup of plaque.

00:21.432 --> 00:24.955
It involves threading a thin tube into a patient's arteries.

00:25.443 --> 00:26.961
This is what an angiogram looks like.

00:27.366 --> 00:31.503
But angiograms don't always spot problems in women's arteries.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.589
That puts women at greater risk for a heart attack.

00:36.750 --> 00:38.854
The World Health Organization reports that...

00:39.081 --> 00:42.834
...heart disease claims the lives of 18 million women a year,...

00:43.347 --> 00:46.637
...and it's a disease that doesn't just impact older women.

00:47.181 --> 00:51.913
Carrie Vincent had a massive heart attack after giving birth to her first child.

00:52.344 --> 00:53.796
My God, I was 31 years old,...

00:54.651 --> 00:56.681
...31 year olds don't have heart attacks.

00:56.921 --> 01:00.123
Vincent is now taking her message to women in their homes.

01:00.601 --> 01:03.746
Irene Pollin went into action when she learned this fact.

01:03.986 --> 01:05.942
Heart disease was the number one killer of women.

01:06.272 --> 01:09.260
Pollin founded an organization called "Sister to Sister"...

01:09.691 --> 01:11.875
...that educates women about heart disease.

01:12.352 --> 01:16.269
She encourages women to learn about their blood pressure, cholesterol levels,...

01:16.603 --> 01:18.070
...and other risk factors.

01:18.362 --> 01:25.268
The goal is really prevention, having people understand the risk that they should really...

01:25.475 --> 01:27.350
...try to get screened, know their numbers,...

01:27.823 --> 01:29.094
...and then do something about it.

01:29.691 --> 01:34.047
Pollin teamed up with cardiologists at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston,...

01:34.421 --> 01:37.180
...with Dr. Joanne Foody focuses on prevention.

01:37.523 --> 01:40.037
The good news is we know that 90 percent of heart disease...

01:40.147 --> 01:42.129
...is preventable by reducing risk.

01:42.753 --> 01:45.444
That means becoming or remaining a nonsmoker,...

01:45.939 --> 01:51.165
...controlling or avoiding diabetes, exercising 30 minutes most days,...

01:51.575 --> 01:54.961
...maintaining a healthy weight, eating the right foods,...

01:55.087 --> 01:57.277
...and managing or reducing stress.

01:58.033 --> 02:01.425
Heart disease increasingly affects women in developing countries.

02:02.010 --> 02:05.331
Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian places a lot of blame...

02:05.624 --> 02:07.734
...on the global obesity epidemic.

02:08.187 --> 02:10.973
People are getting chronic diseases not from eating too much...

02:11.081 --> 02:12.587
...but eating poorly, and so in fact,...

02:13.122 --> 02:15.551
...what they're not eating is actually, probably, mostly what's harming them.

02:15.987 --> 02:19.664
Dr. Mozaffarian recommends increasing our intake of fish,...

02:20.054 --> 02:23.422
...whole grains, vegetables, vegetable oils, and nuts,...

02:23.527 --> 02:27.389
...and decreasing the amount of salt and trans fats in our diets.

02:28.200 --> 02:32.396
Both doctors recommend public policies that promote heart health,...

02:32.863 --> 02:34.969
...and of course, screening and education.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.031
The type that "Sister to Sister"...

02:37.597 --> 02:40.703
...and Carrie Vincent are doing one event at a time.

02:41.229 --> 02:41.978
Thank you again!
