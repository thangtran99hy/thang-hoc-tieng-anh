00:07.686 --> 00:13.792
When morals decline and good men do nothing, evil flourishes.

00:15.868 --> 00:20.385
A society unwilling to learn from the past is doomed.

00:21.903 --> 00:23.853
We must never forget our history.

00:24.782 --> 00:27.643
We must never lower our guard.

00:29.803 --> 00:33.377
Edgar, you will rise to be the most powerful man in the country.

00:37.278 --> 00:39.746
It's my belief that when a man becomes a part of this bureau,...

00:40.348 --> 00:46.622
...he must so conduct himself as to eliminate even the slightest possibility of criticism as to his conduct.

00:47.248 --> 00:50.065
Mr. Tolson, I need someone who I can trust.

00:50.337 --> 00:51.807
I want you to be my number two man.

00:52.225 --> 00:53.485
Do you understand? I need you.

00:55.281 --> 01:00.749
Imagine if every citizen in this country were uniquely identifiable by the pattern on their fingers.

01:01.675 --> 01:04.540
Imagine how quickly we could find them, if they committed a crime.

01:07.155 --> 01:09.592
Do you remember that file we created on his wife?

01:10.218 --> 01:11.070
Mrs. Roosevelt?

01:11.286 --> 01:12.832
Would you make a copy for me, please?

01:13.931 --> 01:14.485
Is that legal?

01:14.813 --> 01:18.859
Sometimes, you need to bend the rules a little in order to keep your country safe.

01:22.228 --> 01:23.810
Please leave the transcripts here with me.

01:23.903 --> 01:25.721
Feel free and share them with your brother.

01:25.940 --> 01:28.621
Mr. Kennedy, let them know that I have a copy of my own.

01:29.691 --> 01:31.383
The president is afraid.

01:31.710 --> 01:34.699
All the admiration in the world can't fill the spot where love goes.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.849
We are all sinners, Edgar.

01:37.226 --> 01:42.042
We tolerated lawlessness in the land until it grew to diabolical proportions.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.655
The blood is on your hands, Edgar.

01:46.016 --> 01:50.045
What are your exact qualifications for your position of the leadership in this bureau?

01:50.155 --> 01:51.304
My qualifications, sir?

01:51.874 --> 01:53.887
I don't know who I can trust anymore.

01:54.045 --> 01:57.885
I've seen right through you. You're a scared, heartless, horrible little man.

01:58.969 --> 02:02.094
Don't wilt like a little flower, be strong.

02:02.537 --> 02:03.244
Yes, mother.

02:04.931 --> 02:10.270
It's time this generation learn the difference between villain and hero.

02:14.003 --> 02:15.709
Even great men can be corrupted.
