00:07.468 --> 00:09.643
Morning, Mr. Shaw. Everything's set for your dinner party.

00:10.726 --> 00:12.834
That guy stole from everyone who works in your building.

00:13.871 --> 00:14.757
Who's gonna get our money?

00:14.964 --> 00:15.615
It's all gone.

00:17.206 --> 00:18.888
I'm thinking of becoming a male prostitute.

00:19.203 --> 00:20.147
I think I might have a better idea.

00:21.353 --> 00:25.371
So you're saying you want to rob 20 million dollars from Arthur Shaw's penthouse apartment?

00:25.624 --> 00:26.628
You're gonna go to jail.

00:26.745 --> 00:26.873
Yes!

00:26.937 --> 00:27.701
You're gonna die,...

00:27.793 --> 00:28.503
...probably both.

00:28.606 --> 00:30.393
Yeah, yes! Join me!

00:31.735 --> 00:32.103
I'm in.

00:32.232 --> 00:32.842
I'm in.

00:33.007 --> 00:34.871
Well, now we're undefeatable aren't we?

00:35.038 --> 00:36.568
Let's storm the castle together.

00:36.659 --> 00:38.393
We're not criminals, we don't know how to steal.

00:38.569 --> 00:39.358
I know someone who does.

00:41.291 --> 00:41.993
You made bail.

00:44.220 --> 00:46.204
Today, I taught you how to pick a lock with a bobby pin.

00:46.363 --> 00:49.957
Here's your bobby pin, this is your bobby pin, this is your punk-ass bobby pin.

00:50.385 --> 00:52.239
You unlock the door, you won't freeze to death.

00:53.503 --> 00:55.163
I'm in a restaurant across from the tower.

00:55.461 --> 00:57.315
What are you doing? It's supposed to be a secret.

00:57.412 --> 00:59.261
I didn't say which restaurant across from the tower.

00:59.358 --> 01:00.619
Can't afford to eat here anyway.

01:00.905 --> 01:03.766
We can order whatever we like. Lunch is on me.

01:06.554 --> 01:09.022
In a robbery, you've got to be ready to adapt to any moment.

01:10.295 --> 01:12.367
How is this supposed to be right if you made it out of Legos?

01:12.490 --> 01:13.815
Dimensions are completely accurate.

01:13.913 --> 01:17.129
You might as well use Lincoln Logs or Tinker Toys. And who's this? Webster?

01:19.849 --> 01:20.787
The maid has gone rogue.

01:20.909 --> 01:22.910
You mess with me, you're a dead man.

01:23.888 --> 01:26.201
I don't care what it takes, I will find a way to make things right.

01:27.382 --> 01:28.689
The real trick is getting away with it.

01:30.219 --> 01:30.549
Let's do it.

01:32.449 --> 01:35.091
Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is just moments away.

01:36.136 --> 01:36.987
We've got a dangler!

01:37.843 --> 01:38.725
 I'm not going out there.

01:40.255 --> 01:42.429
I will blow your face clean off your face.

01:45.588 --> 01:48.767
Oh! Oh! Whoops!

01:48.982 --> 01:49.751
What the hell were you doing?

01:49.853 --> 01:52.877
You would start foaming up in the mouth and your eyes were going crooked. It was very scary.
