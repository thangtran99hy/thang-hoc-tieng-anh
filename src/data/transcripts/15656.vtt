00:03.923 --> 00:06.459
Nobody ever set their sights on second place.

00:07.502 --> 00:09.957
Who aspires to be almost remembered?

00:11.429 --> 00:15.546
There's a reason there are no giant foam fingers that say, "We're number three".

00:17.524 --> 00:19.390
No one wants to tell an average joke,...

00:21.185 --> 00:22.896
...make an underwhelming entrance,...

00:24.689 --> 00:25.674
...go out with a whimper.

00:27.152 --> 00:31.241
No one ever stood in front of the mirror with a hairbrush pretending to be the tambourine player.

00:31.766 --> 00:34.815
And there are definitely more kids dressed as Batman than Robin.

00:35.483 --> 00:36.767
We all aspire.

00:38.337 --> 00:44.247
So when we built the new Samsung Galaxy S II, we built it to be the best and brightest,...

00:44.643 --> 00:48.317
...with the most vivid screen out there, on our fastest phone ever.

00:51.150 --> 00:54.603
Because we're Samsung and that's just the way we're wired.

00:54.920 --> 00:56.620
The Samsung Galaxy S II.
