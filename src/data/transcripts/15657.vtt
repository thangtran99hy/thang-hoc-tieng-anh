00:08.323 --> 00:15.230
Gentlemen, it is my special pleasure to introduce a woman who clearly needs no introduction.

00:16.184 --> 00:19.121
A very great actress on her first trip to London.

00:19.485 --> 00:22.112
Marilyn, is it true that you wear nothing in bed but perfume?

00:22.777 --> 00:26.462
Darling, as I'm in England, let's say I sleep in nothing but Yardley's lavender.

00:29.277 --> 00:30.511
I long to see her.

00:31.795 --> 00:33.293
This story describes a miracle.

00:34.245 --> 00:34.841
Ms. Monroe?

00:35.537 --> 00:36.602
Marilyn is not ready.

00:36.925 --> 00:38.466
Excuse my horrible face.

00:38.942 --> 00:41.135
Few days of my life when a dream came true.

00:41.722 --> 00:43.091
Are you frightened of me, Colin?

00:43.196 --> 00:43.455
No!

00:43.712 --> 00:45.265
Good. 'Cause I like you.

00:45.967 --> 00:46.919
Colin, is everything okay?

00:47.229 --> 00:49.389
Ms. Monroe had some large packages she needed handled.

00:50.986 --> 00:52.796
What's Marilyn doing with my third assistant?

00:53.174 --> 00:53.860
Surprise!

00:54.663 --> 00:56.052
Get back here, Colin!

00:56.877 --> 00:58.263
I have something in my eye.

00:58.496 --> 00:59.324
I can't see anything.

01:01.236 --> 01:03.161
Be careful not to get in too deep, son.

01:04.696 --> 01:06.757
Marilyn Monroe fancying you? Come on!

01:07.943 --> 01:10.322
She breaks hearts, she will break yours.

01:11.254 --> 01:13.917
I wouldn't buy that little girl lost act, if I were you.

01:14.827 --> 01:17.180
I think Marilyn knows exactly what she's doing.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.785
All people will ever see is Marilyn Monroe.

01:22.744 --> 01:25.711
What must it be like to be the most famous woman on Earth?

01:26.497 --> 01:28.757
You could quit this. Forget Marilyn Monroe.

01:29.515 --> 01:30.101
Forget Hollywood.

01:30.869 --> 01:31.676
Let it all go.

01:43.003 --> 01:45.661
First love is such sweet despair, Colin.

01:48.907 --> 01:49.686
Shall I be her?

01:49.821 --> 01:50.043
Who?

01:50.499 --> 01:50.977
Marilyn.
