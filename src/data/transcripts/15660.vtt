00:03.267 --> 00:05.891
People didn't want to talk to me very much after that.

00:06.605 --> 00:09.457
It was a pretty difficult time.

00:11.257 --> 00:14.321
You know, it's the last race of the year; you don't have a chance to redeem yourself.

00:16.187 --> 00:24.596
We lost the championship by one point so I tried not to be too hard on myself, but yes.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.378
I am very hard on myself,...

00:27.521 --> 00:34.737
...especially since this is something that doesn't leave your mind very quickly.

00:37.328 --> 00:38.213
My failure?

00:41.223 --> 00:42.909
I almost failed out of high school twice.

00:43.289 --> 00:45.596
I had a really bad year where everything went wrong.

00:46.281 --> 00:47.851
Oh yeah, everybody makes mistakes.

00:48.113 --> 00:51.685
It broke all the bolts and the structure basically collapsed.

00:52.193 --> 00:53.913
Well, I made a formal apology.

01:07.430 --> 01:09.873
I can remember when I was out at the go-kart track one day.

01:11.307 --> 01:14.244
You use the stopwatch and time the lap and...

01:18.957 --> 01:22.152
...I remember I kept giving myself like 1 second less like,..

01:22.255 --> 01:24.049
..."Okay, was that 41 seconds that time?"

01:25.220 --> 01:27.143
"Was that 40 seconds that time to get around?"

01:31.972 --> 01:35.799
I like to be able to see the improvement and with racing, it's very obvious.

01:37.193 --> 01:39.157
You know, I can see the direct result of my effort.

01:43.837 --> 01:44.940
We were in Homestead, Florida.

01:47.265 --> 01:49.877
And this was my first IndyCar race, then there was a crash.

01:53.103 --> 01:56.187
I didn't remember anything; the car was on fire and...

01:59.663 --> 02:02.093
...my brain was covering up for the fact that this is a...

02:02.699 --> 02:06.499
...bit of a heightened situation, that I shouldn't be aware what's going on right now but...

02:12.087 --> 02:15.561
...I woke up in the medical center and there was a bright light above me and...

02:15.959 --> 02:19.313
...Father Bob is over here to the left and I've got needles in my arm.

02:21.008 --> 02:22.443
So, that was probably the worst moment.

02:30.946 --> 02:33.646
If you're driving your car and you feel frightened a little bit,...

02:33.952 --> 02:35.527
...we bump up against that feeling...

02:35.806 --> 02:41.497
...as much as we can to try and push that limit further and get comfortable there.

02:41.631 --> 02:42.785
And then push it again.

02:45.017 --> 02:48.860
You're constantly on the brink of crashing 'cause that's the fastest.
