00:02.001 --> 00:02.777
The martini!

00:03.384 --> 00:06.396
The martini is the ultimate cool and sophisticated drink.

00:07.041 --> 00:11.961
Sipping a martini from a stemmed, cocktail glass makes everyone feel a bit James Bondish...

00:12.516 --> 00:15.486
...who, by the way, likes his martini shaken, not stirred.

00:17.503 --> 00:21.653
Where and how the first martini came to be is pure libation lore.

00:21.983 --> 00:27.981
One story, in 1849, has a successful prospect walking into a bar and ordering a drink.

00:28.611 --> 00:32.795
The bartender fixes him a Martinez special which later became the martini.

00:33.299 --> 00:37.215
Another story in the 1860s, a cocktail called the Martinez...

00:37.292 --> 00:39.922
...was created in the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco.

00:40.125 --> 00:42.663
The hotel was near the porch to the town of Martinez.

00:43.071 --> 00:45.113
We do know that in the late 19th century,...

00:45.281 --> 00:48.621
...bartending guides featured drinks with similar names and ingredients.

00:48.877 --> 00:51.129
Martinis have always had an edgy air about them,...

00:51.248 --> 00:53.701
...which maybe why James Bond found them so appealing.

00:54.107 --> 00:58.377
This maybe due to the fact that illegal and easy gin manufacturing during Prohibition,...

00:58.747 --> 01:00.778
...made the martini one of the predominant cocktails.

01:01.130 --> 01:03.380
Classic martinis are made with just three ingredients:...

01:03.563 --> 01:06.379
...gin, vermouth, which can be either dry or sweet,...

01:06.896 --> 01:10.207
...and a garnish, typically a green olive or a twist of lemon peel.

01:11.009 --> 01:13.345
The measurement of these ingredients is up for grabs.

01:14.169 --> 01:18.177
Martini aficionados are positively finicky about how their martinis were made.

01:19.250 --> 01:23.463
The biggest area of contention is around how dry or how wet your martini is.

01:24.286 --> 01:25.681
The less vermouth, the drier.

01:26.757 --> 01:29.041
The more vermouth you have, the wetter the martini.

01:30.350 --> 01:31.528
Here's how you make the martini:...

01:32.067 --> 01:36.119
...fill a cocktail shaker with ice cubes, add gin, add vermouth,...

01:36.777 --> 01:37.636
...shake or stir,...

01:38.527 --> 01:42.118
...pour the martini in the chilled cocktail glasses, add garnish, and serve.

01:43.206 --> 01:46.016
Drink martini straight up, which means without ice.

01:46.434 --> 01:50.110
Dry or wet, shaken or stirred, go classic tonight with the martini.

01:50.365 --> 01:51.430
Evening wear is optional.
