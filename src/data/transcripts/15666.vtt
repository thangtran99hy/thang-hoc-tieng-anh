When you receive a voicemail,...

00:04.009 --> 00:08.807
...Google Voice will automatically transcribe it into text, so you can read what the voicemail is about.

00:11.537 --> 00:13.839
You can see transcriptions in your inbox,...

00:14.978 --> 00:18.118
...and we'll even email and SMS them to you, if you want.

00:19.336 --> 00:23.100
Transcriptions are fully automated, so they may include mistakes,...

00:23.194 --> 00:25.529
...and we plan to make accuracy improvements over time.

00:27.297 --> 00:29.052
Hey, give me a call when you get a chance.

00:30.443 --> 00:32.397
If you would like to turn transcription off,...

00:32.734 --> 00:39.881
...just go to your settings and uncheck the box next to "Transcribe Voicemails."
