Hi, I'm David Washington and I'm a program manager on the Windows 8 user experience team.

00:09.857 --> 00:14.154
I work on how Windows scale through different screens and form factors.

00:14.867 --> 00:19.960
Today, I'm going to show you portrait and rotation on this Samsung prototype device.

00:22.270 --> 00:26.541
Windows 8 tablets can be rotated at any time to the portrait view.

00:27.436 --> 00:29.762
While on portrait you can check the weather,...

00:31.268 --> 00:33.108
...switch back to that game that you're playing,...

00:34.197 --> 00:37.159
...or read one of your favorite websites online.

00:38.911 --> 00:44.523
Each application can tailor the view for what makes the most sense in portrait.

00:46.327 --> 00:52.185
The great news is all the system controls work just as well in portrait, like the keyboard.

00:53.139 --> 00:55.759
You can pick files from your file system...

00:57.949 --> 01:02.879
...or you can use any of the system charms, like Share or Search.

01:04.507 --> 01:08.088
And it works just as well in portrait as it does in landscape.

01:09.447 --> 01:13.786
We hope you've enjoyed this quick demonstration of portrait and rotation in Windows 8.

01:14.665 --> 01:16.371
We look forward to you trying it out yourself.
