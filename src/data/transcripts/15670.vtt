00:04.543 --> 00:08.417
Remember, Jobs isn't selling hardware, he's selling an experience.

00:08.721 --> 00:12.407
If you offer numbers and statistics, make them meaningful.

00:13.953 --> 00:17.151
We have sold four million iPhones to date.

00:18.743 --> 00:25.055
If you divide 4 million by 200 days, that's 20,000 iPhones every day on average.

00:27.418 --> 00:30.400
Numbers don't mean much unless they're placed in context.

00:30.867 --> 00:33.513
Managers, connect the dots for your listeners.

00:33.969 --> 00:39.265
Recently I worked with a company that launched a 12 gigabyte memory card, 12 gigabytes!

00:40.279 --> 00:43.727
That number doesn't mean much to most people, so we put it into context.

00:44.007 --> 00:49.435
We said, "That's enough memory to listen to your music while traveling to the moon and back."

00:50.134 --> 00:52.585
Now, 12 gigs means something to me.

00:53.164 --> 00:54.912
Make numbers meaningful.

00:57.219 --> 01:02.129
One of the most effective elements of the Steve Jobs presentation is that they are easy on the eyes.

01:02.452 --> 01:04.995
His presentations are visual and simple.

01:08.510 --> 01:13.600
While most speakers fill their slides with mind-numbing data and text and charts,...

01:13.910 --> 01:15.659
...Jobs does just the opposite.

01:16.008 --> 01:21.194
He uses very little text and usually one, maybe two images per slide.

01:21.705 --> 01:25.218
You see, you want to paint a picture for your audience without overwhelming them.

01:25.795 --> 01:30.520
Inspiring presentations are short on bullet points and big on visuals.

01:32.183 --> 01:35.998
If you really want your presentation to pop, treat it like a show...

01:36.601 --> 01:39.470
...with ebbs and flows, themes and transitions.

01:40.138 --> 01:43.546
Jobs includes video clips, demonstrations and guests.

01:44.055 --> 01:47.226
He also has a knack for dramatic flair that's very effective.

01:47.889 --> 01:50.164
For example, when introducing the MacBook Air,...

01:50.368 --> 01:54.475
...Jobs drew cheers by opening a manila interoffice envelope and...

01:54.767 --> 01:56.836
...holding the laptop out for everyone to see.

02:00.243 --> 02:06.361
This is the new MacBook Air and you can get a feel for how thin it is.

02:07.349 --> 02:10.439
What is the one memorable moment of your presentation?

02:10.867 --> 02:12.827
 Identify it ahead of time and then build up to it.

02:14.181 --> 02:15.989
With a little help from our friends, everything will work today.

02:16.713 --> 02:20.371
And finally rehearse, rehearse and rehearse some more.

02:20.688 --> 02:22.077
Let me show you how easy that is now.

02:25.517 --> 02:29.754
Steve Jobs makes it look easy because he spends hours rehearsing.

02:30.378 --> 02:34.763
He cannot pull off an intricate presentation with video clips and demonstrations,...

02:34.855 --> 02:37.330
...and outside speakers without practice.

02:38.077 --> 02:44.143
The result: a presentation that is perfectly synchronized and looks, yes, effortless.

02:44.995 --> 02:49.805
Now, the average business person does not have the resources to create a Steve Jobs extravaganza.

02:50.164 --> 02:52.201
But you do have time to rehearse.

02:52.871 --> 02:55.329
The greatest presenters do it and so should you.

02:57.027 --> 02:58.406
Oh, and one more thing.

02:59.217 --> 03:04.481
At the end of most presentations Jobs adds to the drama by saying, "And one more thing."

03:05.057 --> 03:06.010
One last thing.

03:07.050 --> 03:11.803
He then adds a new product or a feature, sometimes just introduces a band.

03:12.179 --> 03:14.131
This not only heightens the excitement,...

03:14.423 --> 03:17.575
...it also leaves your audience feeling they've been given an added bonus.

03:18.243 --> 03:22.051
The point is, Steve Jobs approaches each presentation as an event.

03:22.362 --> 03:27.460
A production with a strong opening, product demonstrations in the middle and a strong conclusion.

03:27.827 --> 03:31.324
And yes, even an encore, that "one more thing."

03:32.091 --> 03:34.164
I wish you a dazzling presentation.

03:36.701 --> 03:38.919
