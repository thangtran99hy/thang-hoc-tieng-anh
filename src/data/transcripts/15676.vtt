00:00.714 --> 00:04.537
Today, the Olympic Games are held every four years in a different country.

00:05.078 --> 00:07.277
It's an opportunity for the world's top athletes...

00:07.347 --> 00:11.313
...to test their skills and determination in individual or team sports.

00:12.005 --> 00:15.773
They compete for the Olympic gold medals, which only winners can receive.

00:16.561 --> 00:20.965
To understand the modern Olympics better, we must return to the origin of the Games:...

00:21.473 --> 00:22.183
...Greece.

00:23.376 --> 00:28.012
For the ancient Greeks, the Olympic Games represented the highest form of physical achievement.

00:28.301 --> 00:31.139
The Games were a mix of athletic skill and religion.

00:31.441 --> 00:35.231
They were celebrated in a festival dedicated to the Greek god Zeus.

00:35.551 --> 00:38.075
The Olympics were also a time of political calm.

00:38.461 --> 00:41.412
During the Olympic Games, there was peace across the land.

00:42.045 --> 00:47.212
Athletes traveled from all over the ancient Greek world to compete in beautiful green Olympia.

00:48.393 --> 00:54.516
According to legend, a runner named Coroebus was the first Olympic champion in 776 B.C.

00:55.113 --> 00:58.583
He was a cook who defeated all other competitors in a footrace.

00:59.346 --> 01:02.415
Footraces were central events in the ancient Games at the time.

01:03.139 --> 01:05.565
Men competed with no shoes or clothes.

01:05.925 --> 01:09.048
They were covered only in olive oil as they ran down a straight path...

01:09.167 --> 01:11.764
...in front of a crowd of up to 40,000 people.

01:13.081 --> 01:16.343
Over the centuries, the competitions became more serious.

01:16.697 --> 01:21.085
Olympic rules required athletes to train for at least ten months before the big event.

01:21.573 --> 01:25.589
They then had to train with expert judges for the 30 days before they competed.

01:26.265 --> 01:28.991
Being able to run fast continued to be important.

01:29.259 --> 01:32.796
But the Games also began to include the five pentathlon sports:...

01:33.228 --> 01:38.221
...discus throwing, javelin throwing, running, long jumping and wrestling.

01:38.854 --> 01:41.485
Most of these are still part of today's decathlon.

01:43.822 --> 01:49.095
Discus throwers competed in much the same way as now, but their discus was made of stone.

01:49.417 --> 01:52.961
This material was later replaced by metals such as bronze.

01:54.137 --> 01:58.528
Long jumpers at the time used to hold weights in their hands to give them more momentum.

01:58.926 --> 02:02.315
The extra weight helped to push the athletes through the air when they jumped.

02:02.882 --> 02:07.221
Javelin throwing probably came directly from the skills used to hunt animals.

02:07.439 --> 02:12.850
Like today's javelin, the ancient javelin was a pointed wooden stick about the same height as a man.

02:13.251 --> 02:16.287
However, they used to have a special leather finger holder.

02:16.561 --> 02:19.852
This gave the throwers more power, accuracy and distance.
