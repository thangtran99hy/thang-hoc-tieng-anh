When an animal has a toothache, it can't just go to the dentist's office.

00:07.916 --> 00:10.105
Fortunately, there's someone who can help.

00:11.137 --> 00:14.524
Dr. Sarah de Sanz is a "people dentist" most of the time.

00:15.052 --> 00:18.604
She treats human patients in her dental office in the San Francisco area.

00:19.116 --> 00:24.211
However, she sometimes treats patients who can't come to her office, or even fit into her chair.

00:24.755 --> 00:26.093
What kind of patients are these?

00:27.135 --> 00:27.747
Animals.

00:30.153 --> 00:32.657
Dr. de Sanz is a part-time zoo dentist.

00:33.926 --> 00:38.564
She and her father, Dr. Paul Brown, work as a team in the San Francisco area.

00:38.845 --> 00:42.560
They do checkups, fillings, and other dental work on anyone...

00:42.744 --> 00:44.675
...or anything that needs them.

00:45.189 --> 00:49.229
My dad and I started working on animals together when I was in dental school.

00:49.467 --> 00:53.872
He's great to work with, he's very patient and we really enjoy working together.

00:54.043 --> 00:57.147
Oh, I'm thrilled that Sarah has become a dentist, but I didn't have anything to do with it.

00:57.456 --> 00:58.007
That's not true.

00:59.352 --> 01:00.937
Yeah, so I'm happy. I think it's a wonderful job.

01:01.941 --> 01:04.739
Going to the dentist is frightening for a lot of people,...

01:05.081 --> 01:09.161
...but when a dentist is treating a zoo animal, it's the patients who can be scary.

01:09.696 --> 01:12.885
Some of these patients could take a dentist's hand off in one bite.

01:15.435 --> 01:21.329
Both Dr. de Sanz and Dr. Brown are used to working in some of the most dangerous jaws in the animal world.

01:22.980 --> 01:23.936
They're happy to do it.

01:24.647 --> 01:26.622
These animals need their services.

01:28.525 --> 01:33.933
They need their teeth to build homes, catch fish, and defend themselves.

01:34.399 --> 01:37.395
In the animal world, bad teeth can ruin a life.

01:38.527 --> 01:44.129
Like people, the dental problems of zoo animals can be caused by what they do or don't eat.

01:44.767 --> 01:50.613
Animals in captivity, unfortunately, they aren't chewing on bones and carcasses as often as they would...

01:50.785 --> 01:55.337
...in the wild, therefore, the natural cleaning of the teeth is not there,...

01:55.571 --> 01:59.501
...so dental disease is probably a little higher on the list than it would be in the wild.

02:00.182 --> 02:03.265
Animals that are in captivity often live longer, as well.

02:03.679 --> 02:06.347
This means that their teeth have to last longer, too.

02:09.097 --> 02:12.927
Tooth maintenance is extremely important for both people and animals.

02:13.332 --> 02:17.151
Because of this, the dentists regularly do checkups on zoo animals.
