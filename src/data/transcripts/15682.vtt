00:01.071 --> 00:03.979
In Essaouira, Morocco, the fishermen are preparing...

00:04.086 --> 00:05.765
...for another year out on the water.

00:06.139 --> 00:09.202
All around the port, you can hear the sounds of boat building...

00:09.365 --> 00:11.210
...and smell fresh paint in the air.

00:11.692 --> 00:13.646
Everything seems great in Essaouira.

00:14.055 --> 00:16.267
But in reality, things are not very good.

00:16.609 --> 00:19.731
In Essaouira, fishing is no longer such a good job.

00:20.177 --> 00:21.885
The number of fish has gone down.

00:22.495 --> 00:24.821
Some of the fishing work has moved to the south.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.597
The small boats, which leave out of this port,...

00:27.767 --> 00:29.669
...can't compete with the big fishing boats.

00:29.951 --> 00:33.385
Those boats or trawlers can simply catch more fish.

00:34.069 --> 00:35.915
The life of a fisherman now is hard.

00:36.010 --> 00:39.036
Sometimes you work for one day, then you don't work for two days.

00:39.131 --> 00:42.130
Then you work for one week, then no work for 15 days.

00:42.301 --> 00:46.756
The fishing industry here is trying to survive, but now there's new hope.

00:46.965 --> 00:50.148
Recently, this town has a new breadwinner: tourism.

00:50.481 --> 00:53.667
Last year, thousands of tourists visited Essaouira...

00:53.821 --> 00:56.817
...and this tourism has brought hope and money to the town.

00:57.045 --> 01:00.267
Essaouira's first tourist boom was in the 1960s.

01:00.400 --> 01:04.148
Rock stars and people from many different cultures visited the village.

01:04.309 --> 01:07.743
Now, the small town is trying to bring in tourists again.

01:07.899 --> 01:09.734
They want a different way to make money.

01:09.993 --> 01:11.221
The plan is working well.

01:11.363 --> 01:17.137
Since 1996, tourism in Essaouira has increased by more than 300 percent.

01:17.289 --> 01:20.481
It's not difficult to see why people like the historic village.

01:20.827 --> 01:25.621
Essaouira's medina or historic town center was built in the 1700s...

01:25.705 --> 01:29.000
...and was recently put on UNESCO's World Heritage List.

01:29.373 --> 01:33.973
Essaouira now has a very good chance to develop tourism and help its economy,...

01:34.125 --> 01:38.987
...but they must also try not to sell out the local people, culture, and the environment.

01:39.559 --> 01:41.607
The people who are developing tourism...

01:41.771 --> 01:44.000
...say that conservation is important to them.

01:44.322 --> 01:46.374
However, for the people of Essaouira,...

01:46.554 --> 01:50.599
...there are still questions about water, land use and pollution.

01:51.268 --> 01:54.271
Perhaps fishing may now be part of Essaouira's past.

01:54.553 --> 01:57.434
Maybe the town has a chance to make a new life for itself.

01:57.809 --> 01:59.917
Will the people of Essaouira choose well?

02:00.246 --> 02:02.757
No one knows, but the future of this village...

02:02.897 --> 02:05.703
...may depend on the decisions they make today.
