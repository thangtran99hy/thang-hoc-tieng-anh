00:00.507 --> 00:04.886
Flora Salonik grew up in one of Tanzania's busiest cities, Arusha.

00:05.219 --> 00:08.425
She has a university education and speaks four languages.

00:09.077 --> 00:12.043
These days, she depends on the earth for her livelihood.

00:12.320 --> 00:16.667
Flora's life changed because she fell in love with a man from the Dorobo people.

00:18.977 --> 00:21.293
About ten years ago, I met this man.

00:22.041 --> 00:23.968
We fell in love and got married.

00:24.884 --> 00:28.378
We met in Tana, got talking and started dating.

00:33.033 --> 00:36.155
After they were married, her husband, Loshero, brought Flora...

00:36.273 --> 00:40.672
...to the tiny village of Kijungu on Tanzania's south Maasai Steppe.

00:43.142 --> 00:48.225
A four-day journey on foot from Arusha, it's one of the most remote places in Tanzania.

00:50.602 --> 00:54.337
Flora's family knew that she was leaving the comforts of the city for a world...

00:54.495 --> 00:57.801
...without electricity or almost any modern conveniences.

01:00.381 --> 01:03.761
A world where it takes a forty-minute walk just to get water.

01:06.938 --> 01:12.579
Unlike some Dorobo people, Flora and Loshero raise cattle and grow crops to feed their family.

01:12.901 --> 01:16.998
The Dorobo are one of the few hunter-gatherer societies left in East Africa.

01:17.556 --> 01:23.140
The Dorobo lifestyle means that Loshero often spends long periods away from home while hunting.

01:24.261 --> 01:29.066
Flora is often left to care for their three children, their farm and their home by herself.

01:30.967 --> 01:34.675
She gave up everything for Loshero, and now she hardly sees him.

01:36.552 --> 01:39.326
Flora sometimes dreams of returning to the city.

01:43.748 --> 01:47.901
Sometimes, I pack my stuff, ready to go back to Arusha,...

01:49.218 --> 01:51.775
...but I have children, so I can't go home.

01:52.507 --> 01:55.767
Many years have gone by since Flora moved to the village.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.886
There's no telephone or mail service,...

01:58.135 --> 02:01.138
...so she hasn't been able to communicate with her family since she came.

02:02.728 --> 02:05.236
It's difficult to stop thinking about the past.

02:07.331 --> 02:09.903
Sometimes she thinks about the way her life could have been.

02:11.169 --> 02:13.625
She also thinks about what she would have done in the city.

02:14.428 --> 02:15.968
But what can she do now?

02:16.241 --> 02:19.899
She can take her children to live in the city and leave Loshero in the village...

02:20.290 --> 02:22.165
...or she can forget about her old life.

02:23.156 --> 02:27.005
Her husband knows nothing about the difficult choice that his wife must make.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.991
Flora feels restless and decides to visit her hometown of Arusha.

02:35.740 --> 02:38.399
She begins the four-day walk early the next morning,...

02:38.843 --> 02:40.747
...but doesn't dare to look back at her children.

02:42.142 --> 02:43.872
It's painful for her to leave them,...

02:44.273 --> 02:47.600
...but her neighbors will take care of them while she figures out their future.
