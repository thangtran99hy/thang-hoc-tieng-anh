Camogli looks just like any other town on the Italian coast.

00:04.839 --> 00:08.737
The little colored houses face the sea and the sun shines on them.

00:10.127 --> 00:13.877
But, if you look carefully, you'll see something very interesting.

00:15.620 --> 00:20.811
In the town of Camogli, there are many things that seem real but they're not.

00:23.209 --> 00:26.828
This fishing village near Genoa is full of trompe l'oeil,...

00:26.988 --> 00:30.065
...a type of art in which nothing is what it seems to be.

00:32.974 --> 00:38.133
For example, in this particular village, windows open in solid walls.

00:40.004 --> 00:44.790
There seems to be elaborate stonework, but it isn't stonework, it's paint.

00:45.507 --> 00:49.140
And while some flowers die, other flowers live for years.

00:50.119 --> 00:52.974
Why? Because they're painted on the building.

00:54.197 --> 01:00.202
In the past, Camogli's fishermen used to paint their houses in bright colors and unusual designs.

01:00.626 --> 01:04.297
They did this so that they could easily see their homes from the water.

01:04.984 --> 01:11.445
Then, in the 1700s, this style of art became a way to make small, simple buildings look grand...

01:11.697 --> 01:13.632
...and seem like they cost a lot of money.

01:14.482 --> 01:18.435
Now, there are still thousands of trompe l'oeil houses in this area,...

01:18.785 --> 01:21.013
...but only a few artists still paint them.

01:21.448 --> 01:24.097
Raffaella Stracca is one of these artists.

01:24.416 --> 01:27.269
She learned this style of painting from her grandmother.

01:27.901 --> 01:32.496
Raffaella uses a mixture of old and new methods to create her work.

01:35.411 --> 01:39.439
You find a lot of these painted facades in the area of Liguria a lot.

01:39.939 --> 01:42.901
But for a while, it seemed like no one was doing them anymore.

01:43.821 --> 01:47.519
It takes a long time to become a good trompe l'oeil painter.

01:47.963 --> 01:52.423
Raffaella has worked for 20 years to be able to paint stone so well...

01:52.605 --> 01:55.170
...that it looks real even if you're close to it.

01:55.745 --> 02:00.967
Like most painters, Raffaella learned trompe l'oeil from other artists, not in a school.

02:01.494 --> 02:07.403
But these days, there are fewer artists, fewer teachers, and fewer places to learn the technique.
