00:03.480 --> 00:06.845
The country of Zambia lies in the center of southern Africa.

00:07.083 --> 00:10.357
It's nowhere near an ocean, yet it's largely shaped by water.

00:10.641 --> 00:17.069
Zambia is heavily influenced by three major rivers: the Luangwa, the Kafue, and  the great Zambezi.

00:17.522 --> 00:21.254
The Luangwa River flows south from the northeastern end of the country.

00:21.526 --> 00:26.219
Near the Luangwa you can find hippopotamuses or "hippos" , lions,...

00:27.613 --> 00:28.243
...gazelles...

00:30.379 --> 00:31.285
...and crocodiles!

00:37.591 --> 00:41.971
The Luangwa and its banks make an excellent hunting ground for predators of all types.

00:42.285 --> 00:45.715
Both large and small animals depend on this river to survive.

00:46.803 --> 00:49.791
However, as more people move into wildlife areas,...

00:50.045 --> 00:52.597
...these animal populations are beginning to be threatened.

00:53.413 --> 00:57.376
Fortunately, the government of Zambia is protecting these important animal habitats.

00:58.091 --> 01:02.567
Large portions of the Luangwa have been made into national parks and animal reserves.

01:04.030 --> 01:08.437
Zambia's next major river, the Kafue, lies in the center of the country.

01:09.214 --> 01:15.919
Around it, huge level areas of land known as the Kafue Flats have been protected as national parks and animal reserves.

01:17.211 --> 01:20.922
Here, seasonal floods support the environment of rare types of antelope...

01:22.525 --> 01:24.495
...as well as hundreds of species of birds.

01:28.456 --> 01:34.759
The waters of the Kafue also provide hydroelectricity for the country and support irrigation systems for farms.

01:36.425 --> 01:42.041
Both the Luangwa and the Kafue later join the Zambezi, Africa's fourth largest river basin.

01:42.472 --> 01:45.382
It starts small and slow in the north of Zambia.

01:45.631 --> 01:49.463
As it moves toward Zambia's southern edge, its water flows gently.

01:49.773 --> 01:54.209
Here, the Zambezi serves as a kind of "water road" for nearby communities.

01:54.447 --> 01:58.647
They use it to carry things between villages and to travel up and down the river.

01:59.118 --> 02:03.712
But a few hundred miles down, the river becomes extremely fast and powerful.

02:03.973 --> 02:07.189
Here, it becomes one of the world's great waterfalls.

02:07.589 --> 02:10.885
The falling water looks like smoke and makes a lot of noise.

02:11.155 --> 02:14.689
In the local language, it's known as the "smoke that thunders".

02:14.971 --> 02:18.095
The rest of the world knows it as "Victoria Falls".

02:19.047 --> 02:25.573
In 1855, British explorer Dr. David Livingstone became the first European to see Victoria Falls.

02:26.079 --> 02:28.959
He named the waterfall after the British Queen Victoria.

02:29.401 --> 02:32.375
The nearby town of Livingstone was named after the explorer.

02:32.706 --> 02:37.097
It has become a main starting point for tourists who want to visit the spectacular falls.

02:37.369 --> 02:45.607
And they are spectacular, approximately one million gallons of water go over the 355 - foot - high falls every second!

02:46.747 --> 02:50.228
From here, the Zambezi continues its journey to the Indian Ocean.

02:50.727 --> 02:56.291
Along the way, it's joined by the two other great rivers of Zambia: the Kafue and the Luangwa.

02:56.929 --> 03:01.592
Together, it is these three rivers that help to make Zambia what it is today.
