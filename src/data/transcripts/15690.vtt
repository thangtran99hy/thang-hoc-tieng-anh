00:03.295 --> 00:08.503
There's only one thing that's certain about the weather in Alaska: it changes all the time.

00:09.433 --> 00:15.299
There's rain, wind, snow and sometimes, it's fine with lots of sunshine.

00:16.755 --> 00:22.971
But today, there's rain and fog all the way from Denali National Park to the town of Talkeetna.

00:24.234 --> 00:28.521
There, a group of visitors is planning to fly onto a glacier and ski down it,...

00:29.069 --> 00:30.721
...but the weather has other plans.

00:31.445 --> 00:33.160
So, can we go today?

00:34.110 --> 00:37.198
Not until the pilots are comfortable with the weather.

00:38.591 --> 00:43.515
Colby Coombs then explains that the clouds are too low, so the group can't fly.

00:44.867 --> 00:47.557
Colby and Caitlin Palmer are mountain guides.

00:47.968 --> 00:51.430
They run a climbing school, they teach beginner climbers...

00:51.553 --> 00:56.895
...and help experienced climbers to reach the top of Denali, also known as Mt. McKinley.

00:57.457 --> 00:59.569
It's the highest mountain in North America.

01:00.921 --> 01:03.093
Colby and Caitlin are good climbers.

01:03.562 --> 01:06.015
They're not usually doubtful when they are in the mountains.

01:06.599 --> 01:09.371
But even they won't take a small plane out in bad weather.

01:09.809 --> 01:15.711
It's kind of ordinary weather that you usually have to factor in a day or two to put up with bad weather.

01:16.436 --> 01:19.283
So Colby and Caitlin decide on another plan.

01:19.791 --> 01:22.241
Instead of taking the group to ski down a glacier,...

01:22.627 --> 01:24.325
...they will take them to climb up one.

01:25.973 --> 01:29.491
One that they can reach by car: the Matanuska Glacier.

01:30.734 --> 01:36.890
Matanuska is a very big glacier, it's 27 miles long and two miles wide.

01:37.685 --> 01:43.952
The name "Matanuska" comes from an old Russian word for the Athabascan Indians who live in the area.

01:44.614 --> 01:47.829
The glacier is in a low area that has many trees.

01:48.123 --> 01:51.695
It formed 2000 years ago, but it's always changing.

01:52.406 --> 01:57.660
The group gets ready to climb one of Matanuska's formations: a 30-foot wall of ice.

01:58.164 --> 02:01.788
Caitlin explains how to climb it and it's not going to be easy.

02:02.094 --> 02:08.385
The most stable you're gonna be is when you have all the points of your crampons sticking on the ice.

02:09.334 --> 02:20.113
Front points in, heels down, and if you're gonna place the tool really solid.

02:21.232 --> 02:22.589
Okay, off we go.

02:22.963 --> 02:23.067
Great.

02:28.775 --> 02:33.869
The hike across Matanuska is beautiful, but it can also be very unsafe.

02:36.511 --> 02:41.497
One summer, a young man fell into an opening in the ice called a cirque and died.

02:44.761 --> 02:49.304
There are also stories of beginner hikers who get lost and almost die from the cold.

02:50.369 --> 02:52.453
There are crevasses everywhere as well.

02:53.126 --> 02:56.210
The climbers have to be careful, they could easily fall in.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.951
The group walks across the glacier.

03:00.337 --> 03:03.754
It's very cold, they have to keep moving to stay warm.

03:05.749 --> 03:09.499
Finally, they reach solid ice: the heart of the glacier.

03:11.669 --> 03:13.676
From here, it's a wonderful view.

03:14.927 --> 03:18.029
There's a glacial lake with many seracs in the background.

03:19.053 --> 03:23.407
Seracs are large pieces of blue glacial ice that stick up in the air.

03:23.781 --> 03:26.127
The pieces are made when the glacier moves.

03:26.857 --> 03:31.371
Colby explains that an area with many seracs is called an icefall.

03:31.743 --> 03:34.515
He also adds that they can make the area unsafe.

03:34.873 --> 03:38.381
This is because the seracs are very big and may fall.

03:38.605 --> 03:41.600
He adds that a good climber wouldn't hike below an icefall.

03:45.076 --> 03:47.056
The group enjoys climbing the glacier.

03:49.990 --> 03:53.343
It's hard work but Colby and Caitlin make it look easy.

03:59.003 --> 03:59.921
Oops, that was bad.

04:00.409 --> 04:02.973
Next, one of the new climbers tries.

04:03.550 --> 04:04.087
Here I come.

04:16.309 --> 04:19.625
It's a very special feeling as they get to the top.

04:25.332 --> 04:26.239
Thank God for the rope.

04:26.592 --> 04:29.674
Alaska is home to 100,000 glaciers.

04:29.845 --> 04:33.741
These people can say they have successfully climbed one: Matanuska.

04:34.009 --> 04:38.683
Now, just 99,999 more glaciers to climb.

04:38.931 --> 04:40.637
I'm up, I made it.
