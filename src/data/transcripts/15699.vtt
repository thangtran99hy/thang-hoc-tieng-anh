Every manager has to realize that they're not running for office.

00:11.829 --> 00:13.059
You've been elected.

00:17.445 --> 00:18.884
Do the things you have to do,...

00:21.295 --> 00:21.999
...the right things,...

00:27.493 --> 00:32.779
...so that your actions will be understood by people, if not liked, clearly understood.

00:37.177 --> 00:39.341
Everyone should know everything you're thinking,...

00:39.683 --> 00:42.743
...everything you're doing and the rationale, "Why?"

00:48.059 --> 00:48.909
It's critical.
