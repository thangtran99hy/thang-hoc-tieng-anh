Hawaii is a land of legends.

00:03.003 --> 00:07.607
These old stories have existed for many years on these beautiful tropical islands.

00:08.932 --> 00:12.527
One of the oldest legends tells of a special dance called the hula,...

00:13.166 --> 00:16.110
...which started here more than three hundred years ago.

00:17.997 --> 00:22.173
The hula started, as far as legend tells,...

00:22.642 --> 00:27.294
...when Hi'iaka and her good friend Hopoe went down the beach.

00:27.546 --> 00:35.755
Then while they were there, they noticed the waves and they imitated the waves.

00:36.106 --> 00:41.318
And then they started to use their hands, like, you know, portraying the waves.

00:42.169 --> 00:45.047
And that's how the hula started.

00:45.494 --> 00:50.134
In 1820, very religious people from Western countries came to Hawaii.

00:50.565 --> 00:52.097
They were surprised by the hula.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.603
The dancers did not wear many clothes!

00:55.130 --> 00:59.911
The visitors were so surprised that they asked the queen of Hawaii to ban the dance.

01:00.735 --> 01:06.020
After that, most Hawaiians were not allowed to perform the hula for almost sixty years.

01:06.708 --> 01:09.737
But dancers still performed the hula in secret.

01:11.196 --> 01:14.227
Nowadays, there is a new interest in Hawaiian culture.

01:14.725 --> 01:18.169
People want to study the culture and learn how to dance the hula.

01:19.263 --> 01:21.790
More and more people are attending halaus.

01:22.116 --> 01:25.818
Halaus are schools that teach the dance in the traditional way...

01:26.050 --> 01:28.899
...with traditional values and a lot of discipline.

01:29.479 --> 01:32.559
The dancers must work very hard to learn the dance.

01:32.875 --> 01:37.645
They must practice for many hours before they're ready to perform the hula for other people.

01:38.520 --> 01:41.434
Kumano Palani Kulala is a hula teacher.

01:41.802 --> 01:47.268
For him, the dance is a way of bringing the best of ancient Hawaiian culture to people today.

01:47.631 --> 01:54.033
The hula is more not so much a physical thing, but more of a mental and a spiritual thing.

01:54.463 --> 01:58.681
For them the dancing means very little because for Hawaiians today,...

01:58.809 --> 02:00.172
...many of them don't speak the language.

02:00.540 --> 02:06.591
So, what I try to do is to bring to mind the reality that they see today.

02:07.030 --> 02:11.395
Every year, the most important hula competition happens in Hilo, Hawaii.

02:12.017 --> 02:15.725
Dancers from all the Hawaiian Islands come together at this festival.

02:16.309 --> 02:18.663
It's held in the name of a Hawaiian king...

02:18.999 --> 02:23.010
...who helped to return the hula to its place at the center of Hawaiian culture.

02:23.916 --> 02:27.656
In the competition, judges look at more than just the dance.

02:28.573 --> 02:34.305
They also look at the dancer's costumes and style, the way the person wears a skirt,...

02:34.841 --> 02:38.220
...the color of their costume, even the flowers they wear.

02:40.693 --> 02:45.248
Today in Hawaii, the hula is once again part of everyday life.

02:47.269 --> 02:52.687
Many people hope that this will save one of Hawaii's most ancient traditions for the future.
