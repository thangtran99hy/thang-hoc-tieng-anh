00:00.045 --> 00:01.123
So, what have you got here?

00:01.799 --> 00:06.153
So, we have quantum locking, the superconductor is locked in space.

00:06.549 --> 00:08.029
And it stays wherever I put it.

00:09.389 --> 00:11.221
You see this is quantum trapping.

00:12.791 --> 00:13.233
That's amazing.

00:13.317 --> 00:14.593
As long as it's cold,...

00:14.983 --> 00:17.393
...the superconducting is frozen with liquid nitrogen.

00:17.519 --> 00:18.414
Upside down.

00:18.591 --> 00:18.828
Alright.

00:19.135 --> 00:20.231
And it stays locked.

00:20.307 --> 00:24.627
So the fact that it's superconducting is locking the magnetic field in three dimensions, right?

00:24.723 --> 00:25.549
Yeah, exactly.

00:25.872 --> 00:27.172
And that pivots...

00:27.515 --> 00:31.834
Because this is symmetric, it can rotate without breaking the locking.

00:32.506 --> 00:33.437
The locking doesn't break.

00:33.953 --> 00:34.104
Alright.

00:35.159 --> 00:39.479
So, it stays there on the x and y but it pivots on the...

00:39.579 --> 00:41.162
...yeah, on the axis of the magnet.

00:41.332 --> 00:46.448
You see if I can move it on the side, it will again pivot around the axis of the magnet...

00:46.559 --> 00:51.848
...because it makes sure that the magnetic field inside of it stays the same.
