With a population of approximately eight million, the huge cosmopolitan city of New York...

00:06.031 --> 00:08.278
...is a melting pot of immigrant communities.

00:08.887 --> 00:12.350
Sometimes, this diversity results in clashes between cultures.

00:12.600 --> 00:16.896
Other times, positive outcomes result from the merging of backgrounds and traditions.

00:17.281 --> 00:21.508
Artists in particular often use their cultural differences to learn from each other.

00:21.981 --> 00:25.729
One such artist, Ming Liang Lu, has taken his skills to Harlem...

00:25.881 --> 00:29.065
...to enable others to learn about and understand Chinese art.

00:29.615 --> 00:33.541
Born in Shanghai, Ming has studied Chinese art for the majority of his life.

00:34.209 --> 00:38.015
At a very young age, he learned about calligraphy and painting from his father...

00:38.317 --> 00:41.318
...and has continued to paint through the more difficult times in his life.

00:42.017 --> 00:45.713
Ming moved to the US in 1990 and today lives in New York,...

00:45.998 --> 00:51.619
...where he continues to create beautiful landscapes, flowers, animals,...

00:53.061 --> 00:55.976
...and even the symbol of the United States: the eagle.

00:58.871 --> 01:01.452
When I first came to America, my only skills were art.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.252
I didn't have other skills.

01:03.602 --> 01:05.457
I used my art to make a living.

01:06.799 --> 01:08.651
When he first arrived in the US,...

01:08.905 --> 01:13.346
...Ming set up his easel and drew and painted portraits of tourists in order to survive.

01:15.544 --> 01:20.311
But even for professional artists, drawing on the street is not the easiest way to make a living.

01:23.465 --> 01:26.021
So, Ming eventually stopped painting on the street...

01:26.312 --> 01:28.954
...and began to work for the New York Chinese Cultural Center.

01:29.538 --> 01:34.249
Through them, he brought his skills to Harlem and the children of Public School 36.

01:34.742 --> 01:35.226
What is this?

01:36.143 --> 01:37.066
A circle.

01:37.173 --> 01:37.961
It is a circle, right?

01:38.167 --> 01:39.009
Okay.

01:39.413 --> 01:40.599
So I just draw.

01:41.110 --> 01:42.015
I change the color.

01:42.447 --> 01:43.313
What color is this?

01:43.731 --> 01:44.508
Yellow.

01:44.593 --> 01:46.918
Okay, I just put this, do you see this?

01:47.315 --> 01:48.167
For the ear.

01:48.615 --> 01:52.499
As we all know, a lot of artists are not employed being artists.

01:52.933 --> 01:57.719
So I'm hoping that what we do is to provide them this opportunity to really practice...

01:58.672 --> 02:00.108
...in the field that they've been trained for.

02:00.388 --> 02:02.248
Okay, this time I'll take it this way.

02:02.738 --> 02:04.004
Little circle one.

02:05.865 --> 02:07.932
Yeah, you, very good job, good.

02:08.420 --> 02:12.246
Teaching at the public school, though, is more than just an opportunity for Ming.

02:12.487 --> 02:14.827
The program benefits the children as well.

02:14.984 --> 02:17.291
School principal Cynthia Mullen Simons says...

02:17.374 --> 02:20.022
...the program is important to her second grade students.

02:20.513 --> 02:24.224
You cannot teach solely by the book, paper and pencil.

02:24.576 --> 02:25.966
They have to become involved.

02:26.128 --> 02:32.336
We need our students to hear, firsthand, people from various cultures talk about their ethnicity.

02:32.441 --> 02:33.253
Too much water.

02:33.331 --> 02:35.778
I'll show you this, not too much water, you see?
