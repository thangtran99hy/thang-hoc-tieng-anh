00:00.918 --> 00:07.011
For thousands of years, Fulani boys like 16-year-old Yoro Sisse have made a dangerous journey.

00:07.551 --> 00:11.054
They leave their girlfriends and families behind in Diafarabe, Mali,...

00:11.377 --> 00:13.737
...and walk across the edge of the Sahara Desert.

00:14.093 --> 00:18.015
They make this dangerous journey for one reason: to feed their cattle.

00:19.494 --> 00:21.047
At the end of the dry season,...

00:21.211 --> 00:25.860
...the boys must take their cattle out of the Inner Niger Delta and into the Sahel.

00:26.280 --> 00:31.591
Soon, it will be too wet in the delta and the herdsmen must travel to find better grazing areas.

00:32.554 --> 00:35.966
The Sahel is an arid region with very few plants and trees.

00:36.397 --> 00:38.580
It follows the edge of the Sahara Desert.

00:39.423 --> 00:41.079
Cattle like a temperate climate.

00:41.406 --> 00:47.515
The success of the Fulani people is a direct result of their ability to raise cattle in this arid environment.

00:48.463 --> 00:52.737
These young cattle herdsmen live away from home for up to eight months a year.

00:53.335 --> 00:57.041
While they're away, they live mainly on milk from their dairy cows.

01:00.351 --> 01:02.362
We constantly have to find new grazing.

01:03.284 --> 01:04.729
That's what's always in your mind.

01:05.692 --> 01:08.219
In the bush, we have to be completely focused.

01:09.077 --> 01:11.339
Our mission is to bring back fat cattle.

01:13.373 --> 01:17.849
Bringing home a healthy herd is a traditional rite of passage for Fulani boys.

01:18.300 --> 01:22.693
If a Fulani boy returns with healthy cattle, then he is considered to be a man.

01:23.286 --> 01:27.740
When Yoro returns, the other Fulani people will look carefully at the cattle,...

01:27.945 --> 01:31.367
...then they'll decide if he's capable of managing a herd properly.

01:32.116 --> 01:35.311
Yoro's girlfriend, Aissa, hopes that he's done well.

01:36.498 --> 01:40.732
She has a good reason for doing so: she's now old enough to get married.

01:41.127 --> 01:44.159
Fulani parents choose who their daughters and sons marry.

01:44.751 --> 01:47.831
If Yoro doesn't bring his herd home in excellent condition,...

01:48.198 --> 01:51.615
...Aissa's parents probably won't choose him to be her husband.

01:53.633 --> 01:59.645
During the journey, Yoro has to make sure that his cattle get enough food, but that's not his only worry.

01:59.973 --> 02:05.458
There are rebels, cattle rustlers and dangerous mosquitoes that can cause serious diseases.

02:06.134 --> 02:10.403
Yoro starts his journey in Diafarabe, Mali, and walks into Mauritania.

02:10.824 --> 02:14.237
He follows routes that may have existed for thousands of years.

02:14.659 --> 02:19.673
They've been here since a time when people and cattle were first forced into the Sahel.

02:19.984 --> 02:21.698
As the Sahara region dried out,...

02:21.929 --> 02:25.441
...the people that lived there had to leave and find a more temperate climate.
