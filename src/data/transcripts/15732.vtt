00:00.712 --> 00:05.904
This beautiful, quiet place is covered in sunshine and has mountains all around it.

00:06.432 --> 00:08.193
Its name is Machu Picchu.

00:08.879 --> 00:11.399
It's sometimes called the "Lost City of the Inca",...

00:11.929 --> 00:15.089
...and it's nearly 8,000 feet up in the Andes.

00:15.663 --> 00:19.348
There's a magic attraction that you can feel it here.

00:20.281 --> 00:22.853
It's known all over the world that Machu Picchu is one of the...

00:23.295 --> 00:26.173
...magnetic centers of the ancient world.

00:26.439 --> 00:29.571
Machu Picchu is more than 500 years old.

00:29.881 --> 00:33.629
Today, it's a favorite place for visitors from all over the world.

00:33.909 --> 00:37.447
Even in the rain and fog, it's wonderful to walk through the ruins.

00:38.065 --> 00:42.430
When the Inca civilization ended, few people knew Machu Picchu existed.

00:42.691 --> 00:45.509
For a long time, it was lost to the outside world.

00:46.115 --> 00:50.741
Then, in 1911, an explorer named Hiram Bingham found it again.

00:51.123 --> 00:54.145
At first, very few people visited Machu Picchu.

00:54.519 --> 00:57.645
But now, hundreds of tourists come here every day.

00:57.894 --> 01:01.656
They walk up the steps of the ancient city and climb over the ruins.

01:01.898 --> 01:03.919
Machu Picchu is no longer quiet.

01:04.297 --> 01:06.373
It's full of the sounds of tourists.

01:06.899 --> 01:10.302
Some people in Peru hope that more tourists will come here.

01:10.778 --> 01:13.739
They think it will mean more business and money for the country.

01:14.249 --> 01:19.143
However, some conservationists worry that more visitors won't be good for Machu Picchu.

01:19.688 --> 01:22.833
They say that tourism may not be good for the environment.

01:23.283 --> 01:29.327
Jose, a local hotel owner, says Machu Picchu and Peru can take a few more visitors.

01:29.917 --> 01:32.163
Why not be like the rest of the world?

01:32.255 --> 01:36.380
Why not expose and show Machu Picchu to the rest of the world?

01:36.743 --> 01:41.415
It's such a wonderful place, so why keep it to the few?

01:41.681 --> 01:47.398
The truth is that parts of Peru are very poor, and tourists bring money to these communities.

01:47.820 --> 01:52.805
Aguas Calientes is a town that grew suddenly near an area where visitors get on buses...

01:53.027 --> 01:54.669
...to get to the summit of Machu Picchu.

01:55.230 --> 01:58.093
The people here live completely on money from tourism.

01:58.478 --> 02:04.217
The town is just a group of stalls where local people sell art and things they have made to visitors.

02:04.901 --> 02:07.166
The "Lost City" is no longer lost.

02:07.595 --> 02:08.745
Tourists have found it.

02:09.597 --> 02:13.244
The modern world is coming closer to this ancient world every day.

02:13.908 --> 02:16.583
Time may be running out for the Lost City of the Inca.

02:17.051 --> 02:19.007
More and more people are discovering it.

02:19.643 --> 02:24.383
In the end, it may be the modern world that forever changes this ancient city.
