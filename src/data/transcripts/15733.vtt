00:00.509 --> 00:04.367
The Orinoco River is one of the longest rivers in the world.

00:04.597 --> 00:07.817
It starts in the mountains of Venezuela and Brazil...

00:08.025 --> 00:12.754
...and flows for nearly 1,300 miles to its delta on the Atlantic Ocean.

00:13.001 --> 00:17.413
On its way south, the Orinoco flows through many different landscapes.

00:17.579 --> 00:21.949
It moves past ancient stone formations, over waterfalls,...

00:22.673 --> 00:26.365
...through rainforest areas, and across large plains.

00:27.310 --> 00:32.361
The Orinoco Delta is the area where the river's water flows into the ocean.

00:32.707 --> 00:36.415
The area around it is full of streams and small waterways.

00:37.171 --> 00:41.039
These small rivers or tributaries connect to the Orinoco.

00:41.605 --> 00:43.948
One of these tributaries called the Caroni,...

00:44.281 --> 00:48.080
...features Angel Falls, the highest waterfall in the world.

00:49.665 --> 00:54.253
The Orinoco Delta is also home to several South American Indian cultures...

00:54.407 --> 00:57.305
...who have lived next to the river for thousands of years.

00:57.519 --> 01:01.159
Actually, the name "Orinoco" comes from a local language.

01:01.252 --> 01:02.883
It means "place to paddle".

01:03.929 --> 01:07.573
One of these Orinoco Indian cultures is the Yanomami.

01:08.512 --> 01:13.620
About 2,000 Yanomami people live near the river, far from the modern world.

01:14.612 --> 01:20.667
For them and about 20 other local cultures, the Orinoco is an important natural resource.

01:22.262 --> 01:27.084
The river not only gives them a means of travel, but a supply of clean water and food.

01:28.179 --> 01:32.916
The rainforest around the Orinoco River also has many plants and animals.

01:33.305 --> 01:37.181
There are more than a thousand different types of birds and many types of fish...

01:37.367 --> 01:39.214
...including the dangerous piranha.

01:39.819 --> 01:42.843
Around the river, you'll find the Orinoco crocodile.

01:43.091 --> 01:46.293
These animals can grow to more than 18 feet long.

01:46.791 --> 01:50.000
That makes it one of the longest crocodiles in the world.

01:50.561 --> 01:54.341
There are big snakes on the Orinoco too, like the anaconda.

01:54.737 --> 01:58.030
It's one of the largest kinds of snake anywhere in the world.

01:59.386 --> 02:02.565
In the rainforest, you may also find a jaguar.

02:05.049 --> 02:10.227
And on the open plains, you might be able to see the world's biggest rodent: the capybara.

02:15.249 --> 02:19.673
However, over the past fifty years things have changed along the Orinoco.

02:19.939 --> 02:23.762
Some of the cities and towns along the river have grown significantly.

02:24.075 --> 02:27.527
The new industrial world is slowly coming to the delta.

02:27.813 --> 02:31.491
Parts of the Orinoco now have dams to help control the water.

02:31.867 --> 02:35.743
These dams also collect the river's water to create electrical power.

02:36.461 --> 02:42.421
Companies have found valuable products like gold, diamonds, and even oil.

02:45.195 --> 02:51.121
Now, very big ships travel up and down the river from the Atlantic Ocean to move these products.

02:52.119 --> 02:54.609
There have been some big changes on the Orinoco.

02:55.118 --> 03:00.376
However, many sections of the river and the areas around them have stayed almost the same.

03:01.217 --> 03:05.380
There are now several national parks and rain forest preserves in the delta.

03:06.169 --> 03:11.033
They will help this great river remain an important natural resource for Venezuela.

03:11.597 --> 03:16.428
For now, the great Orinoco can continue to support the birds, animals,...

03:16.595 --> 03:18.491
...and people that depend on it.
