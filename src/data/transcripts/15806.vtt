For over 200 years after the original feast at Plymouth,...

00:05.605 --> 00:07.983
...there was no official Thanksgiving Day.

00:08.606 --> 00:12.079
For that we need to give thanks to Sarah Josepha Hale,...

00:13.229 --> 00:20.297
...a magazine editor in the 1800s who had spent 40 years campaigning for a national day of giving thanks.

00:21.659 --> 00:23.514
Her persistent efforts paid off.

00:23.767 --> 00:30.226
Finally, in 1863, President Lincoln declared Thanksgiving a national day to give thanks.
