Sad news from the boxing world tonight. The Associated Press is reporting,...

00:04.053 --> 00:06.389
...that boxing legend Joe Frazier has died.

00:06.707 --> 00:10.603
And Frazier is best known for his three battles with Muhammad Ali in the 1970s.

00:10.727 --> 00:14.037
But since October, Frazier had battled liver cancer.

00:14.193 --> 00:17.262
Jeremy Schaap with more on the life of Joe Frazier.

00:21.721 --> 00:24.514
At the moment in his life when it mattered most,...

00:27.915 --> 00:31.453
...with hundreds of millions of his fellow humans invested in the outcome,...

00:32.295 --> 00:35.307
...it was Joe Frazier who emerged victorious.

00:36.567 --> 00:38.867
Somehow, the fight lived up to its billing.

00:39.261 --> 00:43.064
Frazier withstood Ali's early onslaught and slowly built momentum,...

00:43.486 --> 00:45.351
...eventually grinding Ali down.

00:46.181 --> 00:49.776
A third fight against Ali, which stunned Foreman the year before.

00:50.428 --> 00:53.718
The epic "Thrilla in Manila" was gory and glorious.

00:53.931 --> 00:56.168
The protagonists were both past their peaks,...

00:56.293 --> 00:58.972
...but they put on a brilliant, devastating show.

00:59.542 --> 01:04.075
After the 14th round, Frazier's trainer, Eddie Futch, refused to allow him to continue.

01:04.469 --> 01:07.339
Frazier had lost. But in losing, he had honored himself.

01:08.362 --> 01:13.503
When it was over, Ali said, "I'm just happy right now that there ain't no more Joe Fraziers to fight."

01:15.375 --> 01:19.433
In retirement, Frazier remained a constant presence ringside in big fights,...

01:19.573 --> 01:24.984
...in beer commercials, in interviews, where he alternately expressed anger and admiration for Ali,...

01:25.129 --> 01:26.459
...his eternal opponent.

01:27.043 --> 01:30.369
Overshadowed by the man he defeated in his most significant fight,...

01:30.612 --> 01:33.149
...Frazier goes down as one of the great heavyweights.

01:33.711 --> 01:39.765
If Ali was the hope, the face, the voice of a movement, Frazier was instead a fighter's fighter.

01:40.490 --> 01:41.793
That was good enough for him.
