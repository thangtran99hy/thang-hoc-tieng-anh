Google is kind of a unique company for me and for, I think, a lot of people that work there.

00:09.581 --> 00:12.476
What Google does is it allows you a fantastic environment to be innovative...

00:12.802 --> 00:14.649
...and to get your product developed really quickly.

00:14.958 --> 00:18.000
It is a very different structure than the rest of the engineering community.

00:18.289 --> 00:21.342
We always really try to avoid bureaucracy...

00:21.622 --> 00:25.006
...so that people can really do what makes sense in their project.

00:25.404 --> 00:27.311
One thing that's great about Google is that you have...

00:27.495 --> 00:29.965
...a lot of autonomy over your product and its directions.

00:30.297 --> 00:32.758
We're encouraged to work on whatever we think is important.

00:32.971 --> 00:34.791
Often, the best ideas come from employees.

00:35.179 --> 00:36.817
At Google, if you come in your first week...

00:36.927 --> 00:38.925
...and you have a good idea on how things should be done...

00:39.623 --> 00:42.555
...and people agree with you in that first week, you can start making those changes.
