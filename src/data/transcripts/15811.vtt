00:00.332 --> 00:07.537
Every single American - gay, straight, lesbian, bisexual, transgender,...

00:07.840 --> 00:13.519
...every single American deserves to be treated equally in the eyes of the law and in the eyes of our society.

00:13.872 --> 00:15.503
It's a pretty simple proposition.

00:16.043 --> 00:20.614
Now, I don't have to tell you that we have a ways to go in that struggle.

00:21.963 --> 00:25.503
I don't have to tell you how many are still denied their basic rights,...

00:26.457 --> 00:29.457
...Americans who are still made to feel like second-class citizens,...

00:30.862 --> 00:34.798
...who have to live a lie to keep their jobs, or who are afraid to walk the street,...

00:35.524 --> 00:36.757
...or down the hall at school.

00:39.033 --> 00:42.109
Many of you have devoted your lives to the cause of equality.

00:43.148 --> 00:47.173
So, you know what we have to do. We've got more work ahead of us.

00:49.064 --> 00:54.805
But, we can also be proud of the progress we've made these past two and a half years.

00:55.961 --> 00:59.815
I vowed to keep up the fight against the so-called "Defense of Marriage Act".

01:00.909 --> 01:07.072
There's a bill to repeal this discriminatory law in Congress, and I want to see that passed.

01:07.701 --> 01:12.137
But until we reach that day, my administration is no longer defending DOMA in the courts.

01:12.384 --> 01:17.504
I believe the law runs counter to the constitution, and it's time for it to end once and for all.

01:17.591 --> 01:20.725
It should join "Don't ask, don't tell" in the history books.

01:23.588 --> 01:25.683
We don't believe in a small America.

01:27.100 --> 01:32.683
We don't believe in the kind of smallness that says it's okay for a stage full of political leaders,...

01:34.101 --> 01:36.617
...one of whom could end up being the president of the United States,...

01:37.189 --> 01:39.920
...being silent when an American soldier is booed.

01:41.524 --> 01:46.770
We don't believe in that. We don't believe in standing silent when that happens.

01:47.912 --> 01:50.108
We don't believe in them being silent since.

01:53.557 --> 01:55.261
You wanna be commander in chief?

01:56.932 --> 02:01.678
You can start by standing up for the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States,...

02:02.023 --> 02:03.873
...even when it's not politically convenient.

02:06.651 --> 02:08.833
So, yes. We have more work to do.

02:09.973 --> 02:15.560
And after so many years, even decades of inaction, you've got every right to push...

02:16.158 --> 02:22.012
...against the slow pace of change. But make no mistake, I want people to feel encouraged here,...

02:22.089 --> 02:22.996
...we are making change.

02:23.589 --> 02:28.327
We're making real and lasting change.  We can be proud of the progress we've already made.

02:29.895 --> 02:31.809
And I'm gonna continue to fight alongside you.

02:32.295 --> 02:36.143
I don't just mean in your role, by the way, as advocates for equality.

02:38.411 --> 02:42.273
You're also moms and dads who care about the schools your children go to.

02:44.501 --> 02:47.330
You're also students figuring out how to pay for college.

02:48.524 --> 02:50.746
You're also folks who are worried about the economy...

02:50.843 --> 02:55.032
...and whether or not your partner, husband or wife will be able to find a job.

02:56.384 --> 02:59.439
And you're Americans who want this country to succeed and prosper,...

03:00.302 --> 03:05.419
...and who are tired of the gridlock and the vicious partisanship, and are sick of the Washington games.

03:05.730 --> 03:07.870
Those are your fights, too, HRC.

03:10.219 --> 03:14.156
The slow, inexorable march towards a more perfect union.

03:15.177 --> 03:17.182
You are contributing to that story,...

03:19.313 --> 03:23.558
...and I'm confident that we can continue to write another chapter together.

03:23.647 --> 03:25.305
Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you.
