Doors open at 4 o'clock on Thanksgiving Day?

00:06.535 --> 00:09.385
Online sales beginning the Monday before Thanksgiving?

00:10.039 --> 00:12.765
Christmas merchandise in stores in September?

00:14.049 --> 00:17.496
Thanksgiving; it's one part "Thanks", one part "Giving."

00:18.209 --> 00:21.761
But is this message being eclipsed by Black Friday commercialism?

00:23.027 --> 00:25.807
I'm Doug Matthews, an allrecipes community member.

00:26.352 --> 00:29.757
Last November, I wrote a blog post on allrecipes.com...

00:29.855 --> 00:32.068
...requesting that people give Thanksgiving its due.

00:32.634 --> 00:35.023
The post was titled "Respect the Bird".

00:35.529 --> 00:39.467
This year, allrecipes is taking Respect the Bird to a whole new level.

00:39.802 --> 00:43.313
And we want you to join the fight to take back Thanksgiving.

00:43.815 --> 00:46.667
Here's how you can respect the bird this November.

00:48.121 --> 00:52.225
There's strength in numbers. So first, take the pledge to be thankful.

00:52.857 --> 00:53.895
Share the message.

00:54.391 --> 01:00.315
And finally, follow along at respecthebird.com on Twitter and on Facebook.

01:01.005 --> 01:03.530
We want you to join us at the table this year...

01:03.658 --> 01:06.529
...instead of spending the day shopping for cyber deals.

01:07.093 --> 01:12.475
So ignore the hype, embrace the holiday and most of all, Respect the Bird.
