Many people are very curious about the origin of the CHILDES system; at least I am.

00:18.614 --> 00:20.610
So, could you give us the story?

00:20.959 --> 00:26.455
Sure, I'd be happy to. Actually the idea began...

00:26.739 --> 00:33.666
...in a meeting back in 1984 that was sponsored by the MacArthur Foundation.

00:34.964 --> 00:39.930
They were looking for innovative projects to fund in child development...

00:40.466 --> 00:43.381
...and both Catherine Snow and I were at this meeting.

00:43.991 --> 00:47.952
It was in San Diego and we both came up with the idea at this very same time.

00:48.071 --> 00:51.284
So I think it was an interesting coincidence.

00:51.679 --> 00:55.929
The idea was that child language researchers had been doing all their work...

00:56.049 --> 01:00.001
...really, based on using paper and pencil methodology.

01:01.013 --> 01:06.045
It even goes back to Darwin who used notecards. And at that time in 1984,...

01:06.190 --> 01:08.573
...everybody was starting to use personal computers.

01:09.007 --> 01:12.582
So, we thought, "Well really we should be putting our data in computers."

01:13.051 --> 01:15.508
And I think it was very obvious to everybody...

01:15.579 --> 01:18.671
...that this is a much better way of looking at child language data.

01:19.133 --> 01:24.339
So, we requested money to organize the system...

01:24.712 --> 01:29.351
...and to take all the data that was already transcribed...

01:29.428 --> 01:33.411
...and written on; sometimes hand notes but usually typewritten notes,...

01:34.258 --> 01:36.930
...sometimes in computer files and put it into the computer...

01:37.692 --> 01:42.661
...and we then organized the meeting in 1984 in Concord, Massachusetts...

01:43.215 --> 01:46.073
...and that really was the beginning of the system.

01:46.156 --> 01:51.461
We had 20 child language researchers that came together and everybody was enthusiastic...

01:51.603 --> 01:55.627
...and they agreed to contribute their data and that was the beginning.

02:02.967 --> 02:07.851
Research nowadays is really being driven by the actual computer:...

02:08.891 --> 02:12.107
...methodology and equipment down to the level of the hardware...

02:12.178 --> 02:16.380
...because remember, back in 1984 people really were not using the Internet...

02:17.130 --> 02:21.257
And people had not even started using CD-ROMs; we were using diskettes.

02:21.689 --> 02:25.630
So to distribute the database, we actually had to put the data on diskettes...

02:25.731 --> 02:27.742
...and mail packages of diskettes in the mail...

02:29.317 --> 02:33.113
In fact, they were not even the little square diskettes; they were the round ones.

02:34.659 --> 02:39.307
So, a lot of the revolutions have really been technological revolutions...

02:39.377 --> 02:46.361
...as people got better computers, as they got the Internet of course was a huge change...

02:46.477 --> 02:48.743
...because we could then distribute the data over the Internet.

02:56.631 --> 03:02.044
Another big change really was when we could add audio and video which I think the Chinese University...

03:02.536 --> 03:06.169
...bilingual corpus really represents one of the best examples of...

03:06.558 --> 03:14.230
...linking together video data taken from young children and their parents to the transcripts.

03:14.331 --> 03:17.781
And now, this is becoming the norm for new projects in the area.

03:18.325 --> 03:22.685
Video gives you an even clearer idea of who was sitting where...

03:23.083 --> 03:25.339
...and also gives you the gestural expressions.

03:26.297 --> 03:31.583
Now from a scientific point of view, the audio is very important because...

03:32.125 --> 03:35.428
...a lot of times people will transcribe in one way,...

03:35.546 --> 03:38.805
...and then later on wish they had transcribed another way.

03:39.347 --> 03:40.617
The standards might change.

03:40.711 --> 03:45.975
If you have the audio available, you can always go back to match the original audio facts.

03:46.045 --> 03:48.484
So it's the real fact of the interaction and...

03:49.028 --> 03:55.419
...to lose that, it was really cutting yourself away from the actual facts of CHILDES language.
