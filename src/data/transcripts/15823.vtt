00:06.602 --> 00:08.324
Countryside and wildlife:...

00:08.530 --> 00:12.181
...few combinations make such harmonious companions.

00:14.031 --> 00:19.148
And frolicking otters on the UK's riverbanks are just a perfect example.

00:19.716 --> 00:25.815
But otters in fish ponds are not so harmonious.

00:26.403 --> 00:33.371
This video, titled "Fish Under Attack," shows one devious mammal making off with a huge haul.

00:34.272 --> 00:38.225
Having installed a video camera to find out who was stealing fish,...

00:38.665 --> 00:41.222
...this couple caught the culprit red-handed.

00:41.565 --> 00:45.321
Not before he made off with 39 prized fish.

00:46.267 --> 00:51.261
Further investigation shows it's not just otters that are a bit handy.

00:51.702 --> 00:55.597
Video evidence reveals that raccoons are just as light-fingered.

00:56.893 --> 01:03.787
Mats, rugs, or scraps of carpet within easy reach of cat flaps are rich pickings for this serial snare.

01:05.207 --> 01:09.827
And it isn't just land-based mammals with a penchant for pocket picking.

01:10.219 --> 01:14.611
Gray seals happy to look their victim in the eye before making a getaway.

01:16.490 --> 01:19.364
Reports have also emerged of vanity crime.

01:19.833 --> 01:26.121
The perpetrators usually come across as charming as a ruse to make off with your bling.

01:29.111 --> 01:33.319
But it's not just the call of the wild that leads to criminal instincts.

01:36.891 --> 01:41.176
Coolheaded cat burglars could be inside your house.

01:46.136 --> 01:47.452
You have been warned.
