Hey, I'm Patricia Stark with your Confidence Quickbite.

00:22.047 --> 00:25.094
If your cheeks blush and your heart pounds when you get nervous,...

00:25.323 --> 00:26.421
...take a deep breath.

00:26.801 --> 00:29.295
In fact, take a lot of deep breaths in a row.

00:29.731 --> 00:32.193
Studies show that by taking deep long breaths,...

00:32.263 --> 00:36.330
...you can slow down your heart rate, which in turn will get rid of that blush.

00:36.814 --> 00:41.255
This kind of controlled breathing forces your fight-or-flight reaction to calm down.

00:41.705 --> 00:44.683
Once it starts working, you'll be able to focus and think straight.

00:45.156 --> 00:49.209
And by the way, the more times that you put yourself into a nerve-racking situation,...

00:49.583 --> 00:51.905
...the more you will become desensitized to it.

00:52.160 --> 00:54.739
And each time, you'll be less and less nervous.

00:55.188 --> 00:56.690
Well, that's today's Confidence Quickbite.
