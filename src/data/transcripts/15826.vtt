The South Korean electronics giant, Samsung, has overtaken Apple to become the world's top maker of smartphones.

00:07.900 --> 00:14.041
Latest figures show it shipped nearly 28 million smartphones from July to September against 17 million by Apple.

00:14.669 --> 00:17.767
Samsung only entered the market in earnest in 2010...

00:17.899 --> 00:21.263
...and profits from its telecoms division of more than doubled from last year.

00:22.117 --> 00:25.851
Then, Apple was dominant with nearly 17 and a half percent of the market.

00:26.518 --> 00:30.715
But with an efficient production system that can put products on the market much more quickly than Apple,...

00:31.236 --> 00:35.145
...Samsung has surged to capture nearly a quarter of the world's smartphone business.

00:37.025 --> 00:42.033
Apple's profit last year missed the analyst forecast for the first time in at least six years...

00:42.493 --> 00:46.423
...because customers were putting off buying iPhones in anticipation of the new model.

00:47.008 --> 00:52.053
The recent iPhone 4S release could well prove the weapon to topple Samsung's position at the top,...

00:52.319 --> 00:53.933
...particularly in the run up to Christmas.

00:54.409 --> 00:57.617
More than four million were sold in the first weekend after release.
