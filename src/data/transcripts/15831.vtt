As a communications coach, I'm constantly watching great corporate speakers...

00:09.030 --> 00:12.981
...to find techniques anyone can use to improve the way they tell the story...

00:13.181 --> 00:14.847
...behind a company or a product.

00:14.966 --> 00:15.831
Here's an example.

00:16.259 --> 00:20.079
On a Wednesday, October 20th, Steve Jobs introduced some new products...

00:20.157 --> 00:22.629
...in a presentation titled, "Back to the Mac".

00:23.232 --> 00:26.961
He used several techniques that you can adopt in your very next presentation...

00:27.055 --> 00:28.910
...to add more impact to your message.

00:29.350 --> 00:31.193
First, share the stage.

00:31.599 --> 00:35.251
Nobody wants to hear from one person for an hour or an hour and a half.

00:35.699 --> 00:38.975
Frankly, that gets a little boring and it doesn't show a lot of teamwork.

00:39.458 --> 00:40.963
Find a way to share the stage.

00:41.316 --> 00:44.380
The "Back to the Mac" presentation lasted for 90 minutes.

00:44.553 --> 00:48.031
Steve Jobs was joined by five other Apple employees who,...

00:48.212 --> 00:52.271
...of course, have specialized knowledge in areas related to the products they introduced.

00:52.666 --> 00:54.977
Second, put numbers in perspective.

00:55.280 --> 00:59.743
Steve Jobs and other Apple speakers always put big numbers into context.

01:00.187 --> 01:06.146
For example, Apple COO Tim Cook said that the Mac represents 33 percent of Apple's revenue.

01:06.870 --> 01:09.711
Most people would have stopped there, but he went further.

01:10.107 --> 01:14.454
He said that works out to 22 billion dollars, and he went further.

01:14.955 --> 01:17.340
He said if that division were a stand-alone company,...

01:17.497 --> 01:21.593
...it would rank as the 110th largest company in America.

01:22.243 --> 01:24.364
Third, stick to the rule of three.

01:25.164 --> 01:30.855
The human mind can only consume about three or maybe four points in short-term memory.

01:31.345 --> 01:34.070
So, why give people 22 things to remember?

01:34.514 --> 01:38.014
When Steve Jobs introduced iLife 11 on Wednesday,...

01:38.435 --> 01:40.729
...the next version of Apple's popular software,...

01:40.943 --> 01:45.715
...he said that it comes with many new features but he liked to highlight three applications:...

01:46.078 --> 01:48.963
...iPhoto, iMovie and GarageBand.

01:49.387 --> 01:51.853
He typically does that in most presentations.

01:51.944 --> 01:53.736
He'll focus on three things.

01:53.863 --> 01:54.470
It works.

01:54.960 --> 01:57.708
A person can have the greatest idea in the world,...

01:57.913 --> 02:00.005
...breakthrough products, a unique service,...

02:00.330 --> 02:05.123
...but it's very hard to convince anyone unless you master communication skills.

02:05.553 --> 02:09.571
Steve Jobs has been working at mastering those skills for decades.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.841
And he has something to teach the rest of us.
