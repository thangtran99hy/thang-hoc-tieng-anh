00:00.191 --> 00:02.449
First possession, he gets the ball, he shoots an air ball.

00:02.767 --> 00:04.513
He misses like by six feet and I put my...

00:05.137 --> 00:07.555
...hands on my head and I'm, "Oh please, Lord, just get him a basket."

00:08.334 --> 00:13.555
One minute later, he got his hoop: a three-pointer that set the gym on fire.

00:16.305 --> 00:21.139
I was very excited, the team was excited, everybody else is excited.

00:21.557 --> 00:23.172
But JMc wasn't done.

00:23.480 --> 00:28.451
He kept shooting and kept hitting, another three and another three.

00:30.469 --> 00:32.379
I was on fire. I was hotter than a pistol.

00:32.967 --> 00:36.486
When he was done, he hit the team record tying six three-pointers.

00:36.747 --> 00:40.943
The crowd stormed the court and put Jason on their shoulders.

00:41.185 --> 00:44.922
It was one of those special moments that, as an athletic director,...

00:45.313 --> 00:49.187
...if I retired today, this would be the one thing that I talked about forever.

00:49.771 --> 00:54.469
Jason's playing career is done but his celebrity continues at school.

00:55.089 --> 00:57.580
Everybody, I was late to every single class.

00:58.652 --> 01:01.946
Everybody was saying, "Congratulations!".
