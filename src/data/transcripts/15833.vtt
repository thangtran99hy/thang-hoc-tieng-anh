A bit related perhaps to the last answer you gave.

00:03.455 --> 00:06.247
Do you think English teachers will ever become obsolete?

00:07.206 --> 00:11.201
That's a really, really fascinating question, I think that there'll be...

00:11.902 --> 00:17.174
...lots of different models in the future. I think that simulations, for instance, will grow.

00:17.871 --> 00:23.171
And so there will be, along with real world teachers, there'll probably be things like,...

00:23.598 --> 00:28.607
...a teaching avatar or something which has a degree of knowledge.

00:29.080 --> 00:33.649
But, I don't think, first of all, the artificial intelligence is going to be so developed that...

00:33.935 --> 00:36.997
...a language teacher will completely disappear.

00:38.310 --> 00:42.985
I think there'll be lots of interesting things bent towards going along together.

00:43.439 --> 00:47.873
And so you could have a situation for instance where, person A and person B speak to each other...

00:48.252 --> 00:52.637
...but each sentence they're saying is being translated through something else.

00:52.714 --> 00:57.023
And so they might not necessarily be a teacher in that particular interchange.

00:57.253 --> 01:03.181
And all of those things we can't really predict or see at the moment. But they will change things.

01:04.037 --> 01:06.814
So I don't see that the teacher will become obsolete.

01:06.913 --> 01:11.214
I think it will be much more, the teacher will be one of the key elements...

01:11.550 --> 01:14.526
...running through language teaching and learning.

01:14.675 --> 01:17.915
Along with lots of other elements as well.
