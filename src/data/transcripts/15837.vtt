00:02.986 --> 00:04.928
ï»¿A tree in a Florida swamp.

00:06.340 --> 00:09.279
Egret chicks compete for food and attention from mom.

00:14.275 --> 00:17.023
Down below, hungry gators gather.

00:18.635 --> 00:20.240
Where there are wobbly chicks,...

00:20.639 --> 00:23.322
...there's the promise of manna falling from heaven.

00:24.562 --> 00:26.957
The egrets seem as oblivious to the gators...

00:27.748 --> 00:30.515
...as the gators seem obsessed with the egrets.

00:31.264 --> 00:33.051
It looks like a standoff...

00:33.611 --> 00:37.926
...until a Darwinian melodrama plays itself out in the nest above.

00:38.888 --> 00:43.634
Macabre barely describes this egret version of "Lord of the Flies."

00:45.102 --> 00:49.973
In a bid for survival, two stronger chicks maul a weaker sibling.

00:50.583 --> 00:54.092
With the runt out of the way, there will be more food for the other two.

00:56.697 --> 01:00.593
Down below, the alligators watch this grisly pageant eagerly.

01:08.100 --> 01:14.360
The bigger siblings stab and bludgeon the little one until he succumbs,...

01:16.680 --> 01:21.945
...then, the gators below make like NBA centers leaping for a rebound at playoff time.

01:26.735 --> 01:28.453
It may seem mean to humans,...

01:29.195 --> 01:31.913
...but it truly is survival of the fittest.
