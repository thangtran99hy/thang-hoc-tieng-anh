These rhinos caught in the wild in South Africa are living in captivity in China.

00:14.467 --> 00:15.854
Rhinos don't live in groups.

00:16.241 --> 00:21.419
Now, you see those rhinos there. That's a very abnormal social setting for rhinos.

00:21.893 --> 00:23.409
So, they're under a lot of stress.

00:24.401 --> 00:26.717
They're here because of their horns.

00:27.395 --> 00:32.173
It's a century-old tradition in China to use rhino horns as medicine.

00:32.769 --> 00:38.701
And so, it's very ingrained in society there to go to rhino horn if you have a medical problem.

00:39.529 --> 00:44.652
But Telecky says there's no scientific proof that rhino horn cures disease.
