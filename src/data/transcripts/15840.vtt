In a phone interview, you can have all your material fanned out all around you:...

00:10.188 --> 00:12.917
...resumes, questions, canned answers.

00:13.348 --> 00:16.428
So, take advantage of this and keep all of your documents handy.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.159
Next: practice.

00:20.389 --> 00:22.714
Do a faux interview with a friend.

00:23.249 --> 00:24.331
It's a great way to prepare.

00:24.813 --> 00:26.850
The more comfortable you can be ahead of time,...

00:26.961 --> 00:29.801
...the more polished and natural you'll sound during the real thing.

00:31.024 --> 00:33.761
Finally, don't worry about brief silences.

00:35.652 --> 00:39.107
Have you ever noticed how politicians pause before answering a question?

00:40.038 --> 00:43.511
That's because they're mentally constructing the best response.

00:44.183 --> 00:44.884
Do the same thing.

00:45.484 --> 00:47.711
Don't worry about a pause here or there.

00:48.241 --> 00:50.664
Just be sure to follow it with a thoughtful response.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.753
