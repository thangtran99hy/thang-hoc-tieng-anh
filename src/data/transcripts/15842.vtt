00:01.449 --> 00:02.780
So, what are you doing tonight?

00:05.221 --> 00:05.458
Uh, nothing.

00:05.569 --> 00:07.631
Do you want to go to a party with me?

00:08.054 --> 00:08.345
Yeah.

00:08.414 --> 00:10.517
Or we could just go to my place before and hang out.

00:10.584 --> 00:11.646
Yeah. That sounds awesome.

00:11.829 --> 00:12.237
Hold on.

00:13.473 --> 00:15.458
Oh, I thought you were talking.

00:15.542 --> 00:18.117
You can't always be smooth, but your beer should be....

00:18.671 --> 00:20.609
....with a specially-lined can to seal in the taste.

00:20.977 --> 00:23.603
Keystone Light is always smooth even when you're not.

00:23.781 --> 00:25.264
I'm really sorry about what just happened.

00:26.143 --> 00:27.692
Oh, that's cool. I feel embarrassed...

00:27.865 --> 00:28.399
Just a second.

00:28.883 --> 00:29.453
Oh, man!
