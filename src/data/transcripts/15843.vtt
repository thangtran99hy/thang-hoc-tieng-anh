00:13.852 --> 00:16.062
Here's the thing that makes life so interesting.

00:17.356 --> 00:21.134
The theory of evolution claims, "Only the strong shall survive."

00:21.863 --> 00:24.450
Maybe so, maybe so.

00:25.858 --> 00:28.289
But the theory of competition says,...

00:28.714 --> 00:32.619
..."Just because they're the strong doesn't mean they can't get their asses kicked."

00:33.662 --> 00:34.131
That's right.

00:35.229 --> 00:39.461
See, what every long shot, come-from-behind underdog will tell you is this:...

00:41.047 --> 00:46.254
...the other guy may in fact be the favorite, the odds may be stacked against you, fair enough.

00:47.728 --> 00:51.935
But what the odds don't know is this isn't a math test.

00:53.095 --> 00:55.833
This is a completely different kind of test,...

00:56.822 --> 01:00.917
...one where passion has a funny way of trumping logic.

01:02.924 --> 01:07.887
So before you step up to the starting line, before the whistle blows,...

01:08.133 --> 01:14.058
...and the clocks start ticking, just remember: out here the results don't always add up.

01:18.366 --> 01:21.547
No matter what the stats may say and the experts may think...

01:21.770 --> 01:23.725
...and the commentators may have predicted,...

01:24.439 --> 01:27.308
...when the race is on, all bets are off.

01:28.211 --> 01:34.176
Don't be surprised if somebody decides to flip the script and take a pass on yelling "Uncle!"

01:35.348 --> 01:39.909
And then suddenly, as the old saying goes, "We've got ourselves a game."
