00:00.005 --> 00:02.675
This is the fourth Dragon King of Bhutan.

00:03.347 --> 00:06.511
A beautiful country at the eastern end of the Himalayas.

00:07.263 --> 00:11.318
He became king at the age of 17 in 1972.

00:11.884 --> 00:16.691
It was then, when he had to decide what should be the philosophy behind his reign.

00:17.944 --> 00:21.265
He looked at other countries and noticed in most of them,...

00:21.508 --> 00:24.919
...the government and the people strive for economical wealth.

00:25.821 --> 00:30.683
And those few who achieve this goal usually live a comfortable life,...

00:31.011 --> 00:37.701
...but on the downside many other people live in misery, poverty or social isolation.

00:38.695 --> 00:44.605
Also in the ruthless hunt for money, huge parts of the environment are often destroyed.

00:45.522 --> 00:47.843
This couldn't be the right path for Bhutan.

00:48.530 --> 00:51.640
The concept of Gross National Happiness was born.

00:52.363 --> 00:58.185
The primary idea of GNH is that every human being aspires for happiness...

00:58.877 --> 01:03.219
...and the country's development should also be measured in its citizen's happiness.

01:04.253 --> 01:10.317
The fourth Dragon King's challenge, therefore, was figuring out how to balance economic development...

01:10.780 --> 01:14.141
...with the emotional and spiritual well-being of his people.

01:15.610 --> 01:18.815
Although economical growth can't be the only goal,...

01:19.460 --> 01:22.742
...a flourishing economy gives the government the funds needed...

01:22.851 --> 01:25.753
...to provide a working health and educational system...

01:26.156 --> 01:27.883
...as well as certain living standards.

01:29.579 --> 01:33.223
Because being healthy, having opportunities for the future...

01:33.569 --> 01:37.423
...and knowing that security, a steady income, housing...

01:37.701 --> 01:42.745
...or well-balanced time use are guaranteed is crucial for people to be happy.

01:43.731 --> 01:48.576
But furthermore, people get a lot of positive energy from being with others...

01:48.812 --> 01:50.002
...and sharing interests.

01:50.757 --> 01:56.511
Participating in cultural life and to hold up local traditions and cultural heritage...

01:56.820 --> 01:58.897
...lead to a stronger community feeling.

01:59.755 --> 02:05.564
Healthy family relationships, advocating community activities and religious aspects...

02:05.841 --> 02:08.063
...are factors for achieving happiness.

02:09.089 --> 02:13.784
It gives the Bhutanese people a strong sense of values and identity.

02:15.232 --> 02:18.666
The fourth Dragon King reigned 34 years...

02:18.868 --> 02:22.925
...basing his decisions on all factors of Gross National Happiness...

02:23.356 --> 02:27.427
...asking himself, "What makes Buthan's people happy?"

02:28.026 --> 02:32.904
And the fourth Dragon King lived by example, leading a very simple life.

02:33.477 --> 02:38.235
In fact, he believed so strongly in the concept of GNH...

02:38.697 --> 02:41.965
...that he even decided to hand over sovereignty to the people.

02:42.778 --> 02:50.157
In 2006, he retired as king at the age of 52 and changed the course of history.

02:50.823 --> 02:56.707
Two years later, in 2008, Bhutan elected its first representative parliament.

02:57.343 --> 03:01.390
Since then, the idea of Gross National Happiness...

03:01.741 --> 03:05.026
...has taken quite some momentum outside of Bhutan...

03:05.420 --> 03:08.315
...with other countries and people around the world...

03:08.687 --> 03:14.484
...thinking about adopting the GNH approach to strive for development with values...

03:14.833 --> 03:17.470
...and to make the world a happier place.
