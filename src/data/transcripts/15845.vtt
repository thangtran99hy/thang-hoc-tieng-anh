There are many facets to running a restaurant.

00:01.933 --> 00:02.951
Know your demographic...

00:04.747 --> 00:09.854
...and stick to your guns on the food that you serve and the type of service you are.

00:09.930 --> 00:11.541
You can't be everything to all people.

00:11.939 --> 00:15.958
So, you want to make sure that you focus in and hone in on what your message is...

00:16.289 --> 00:17.688
...and that's what you deliver every time.

00:18.471 --> 00:22.635
If you're gonna be a pizza place that everybody's, the check average is 12.50,...

00:22.967 --> 00:25.709
...everybody comes in and has a good time, then that's what you do.

00:26.331 --> 00:31.179
Don't bring in other types of, you know, don't bring in steaks and fillets...

00:31.261 --> 00:33.890
...and things when it's not your target audience.

00:34.502 --> 00:38.323
That being said, once you determine what that market is,..

00:39.612 --> 00:45.537
...once again, stick to it. It's a lot of hard work, long hours.

00:46.233 --> 00:48.164

00:58.609 --> 01:01.840
Know the government regulations, make good friends with the inspectors,...

01:02.389 --> 01:05.361
...and then as far as the clientele,...

01:07.046 --> 01:10.627
...you wanna make sure that you personally, if it's a single operation,...

01:10.993 --> 01:12.286
...a single person operation...

01:12.380 --> 01:15.485
...or if you have a couple of different people who are kind of in charge,...

01:15.847 --> 01:17.599
...you wanna make sure that you're covering all the bases.

01:17.660 --> 01:21.583
You need the promotions person and promotions just as in advertising.

01:21.652 --> 01:24.658
It's going out, getting your name out there,...

01:25.559 --> 01:27.673
...being in a person who remembers names and faces...

01:28.037 --> 01:31.211
...so anytime you're anywhere, you can talk to somebody.

01:31.287 --> 01:33.319
You know who they are, you maybe know who their kids are.

01:33.653 --> 01:34.920
And you can talk to them...

01:35.149 --> 01:38.006
...about the business and say, "Hey, I haven't seen you for a while." that type of thing.

01:38.371 --> 01:43.199
You have to have your legal side or your bureaucracy side.

01:43.263 --> 01:46.760
The person who can deal with the government regulations,...

01:46.825 --> 01:49.813
...deal with any legal issues that come up and they will.

01:50.779 --> 01:52.281
And then, you have to have the food side.

01:54.053 --> 01:58.185
You have to have your executive chef or the kitchen manager...

01:58.275 --> 02:00.334
...who can deal with the day-to-day of the kitchen.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.570
And don't forget about the front of the house.

02:03.841 --> 02:07.910
These are all different areas that you either have to be an expert in individually...

02:08.100 --> 02:11.525
...and have more than one person there, or be the expert across the board.

02:11.837 --> 02:14.983
As front of the house, you have to be somebody who's great with service, great with managing.

02:15.673 --> 02:19.951
Front of the house people who typically are thirty years and under.

02:20.271 --> 02:21.444
This is their first job.

02:21.825 --> 02:23.841
You have to be able to mold those people to, you know,...

02:24.063 --> 02:26.511
...bend their will to the way that you want it to be.
