00:09.904 --> 00:12.433
Hey! Well, the middle of summer!

00:13.093 --> 00:14.321
I know what you're thinking about.

00:15.045 --> 00:16.553
Christmas!

00:17.497 --> 00:18.797
I know, I can't wait either.

00:20.418 --> 00:20.889
Here, come on!

00:21.099 --> 00:23.073
I've got something really amazing to show you.

00:23.774 --> 00:26.058
But you promise you won't show loads of people or stick it on the Internet.

00:26.237 --> 00:26.707
Here, look!

00:27.200 --> 00:29.381
Gift wrap elves, attention!

00:29.484 --> 00:30.447
Sir, yes sir!

00:30.533 --> 00:32.056
Santa's airborne gift wrap battalion.

00:32.185 --> 00:32.924
The Green Ribbons.

00:33.114 --> 00:34.586
Present arms!

00:34.739 --> 00:38.610
Knife, mission scissors, tape guns, gift wrap, Santa pattern, sir!

00:38.768 --> 00:39.286
Brilliant!

00:39.489 --> 00:43.347
On my count, wrap that!

00:44.967 --> 00:46.113
That, sir?

00:46.476 --> 00:48.802
Let me hear your Christmas noise!

00:48.892 --> 00:50.133
Ho ho ho, sir!

00:50.209 --> 00:51.760
Ho ho ho! Go, go, go!

00:51.989 --> 00:52.761
Quick, this way!

00:57.466 --> 00:58.779
Hey, this is top secret!

00:59.403 --> 01:00.431
Turn that off!

01:01.357 --> 01:02.610
Arthur Christmas.

01:02.855 --> 01:05.893
Wow, that's one big teddy bear.

01:07.728 --> 01:08.730
Coming in November.

01:08.940 --> 01:10.168
There's nothing coming in November.

01:10.245 --> 01:11.165
Go back to your summer!

01:13.467 --> 01:16.125
No polar bears in mission control!
