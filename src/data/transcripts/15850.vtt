00:00.011 --> 00:02.219
As transition, let me get back to that segue.

00:02.349 --> 00:06.219
You have all of this work which you are clearly proud of.

00:06.318 --> 00:11.081
And you've still written a song from your second album.

00:11.160 --> 00:13.081
I'm sure everyone requests songs from your first album...

00:13.165 --> 00:14.483
...as well as from your new album. Well now...

00:15.813 --> 00:18.329
...looking back, has it been a big transition?

00:18.393 --> 00:21.505
Have you changed a lot over the last eight years since your debut?

00:23.655 --> 00:28.781
I'm happy and very proud to say, I just had the ten-year anniversary.

00:29.313 --> 00:33.581
My first album, it's been eight years since my last solo album, however.

00:35.395 --> 00:38.775
And there've been many, many, many changes.

00:39.167 --> 00:47.961
Probably the biggest is especially so many people love my debut album.

00:49.382 --> 00:58.162
And that's still very much requested and cherished by my fans who've been around...

00:58.243 --> 01:00.843
...and followed me for the last decade.

01:02.795 --> 01:06.815
But some of those songs that I wrote on that album; I was 14, 15 years old when I wrote them.

01:06.897 --> 01:09.187
Isn't that crazy? Like Justin Bieber.

01:11.323 --> 01:12.945
Well, I listened to the record,...

01:15.312 --> 01:16.261
"...What was I writing?"

01:16.395 --> 01:18.837
"Where did I get this inspiration? I was like, at school!"

01:19.069 --> 01:23.848
"How did this happen?" I had a very overactive imagination.

01:23.927 --> 01:27.837
And I would listen to songs and watch films, and read books...

01:27.905 --> 01:32.349
...and kind of create these fictional situations to write about and draw from.

01:33.932 --> 01:37.896
The difference being now ten years later, I traveled the world.

01:37.973 --> 01:39.963
I've had good relationships.

01:42.653 --> 01:43.476
I've lived through good,...

01:43.540 --> 01:44.345
...I've lived through bad.

01:45.034 --> 01:46.305
I've grown up a lot.

01:47.212 --> 01:48.641
So, the writing is a lot more personal.

01:49.469 --> 01:55.495
And so that's probably the biggest change is lyrically, I think...

01:55.645 --> 01:58.245
...I have more personal connection now to the songs...

01:58.705 --> 01:59.961
...that I write and I did that.
