00:09.131 --> 00:10.195
Hey! Nice pants!

00:10.687 --> 00:11.319
Excuse me?

00:11.679 --> 00:12.764
I said nice pants.

00:13.017 --> 00:14.379
You can't see my pants, can you?

00:14.534 --> 00:15.237
Of course I can.

00:15.413 --> 00:16.395
How can you see my pants?

00:16.605 --> 00:17.423
They're on your legs!

00:17.722 --> 00:20.094
You haven't been to America recently, have you?

00:20.345 --> 00:21.561
Well, I have actually.

00:21.643 --> 00:22.630
I've just got back from LA.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.123
That's Los Angeles, by the way.

00:24.479 --> 00:25.101
I know.

00:25.760 --> 00:28.605
Yeah, I picked up some of the American words and now I forget which ones to use!

00:28.716 --> 00:29.659
So confusing!

00:29.929 --> 00:31.649
Well, we call these trousers in Britain.

00:31.901 --> 00:32.643
Of course we do.

00:33.138 --> 00:34.163
You know, there are so many things though,...

00:34.260 --> 00:36.050
...it's like a completely different language sometimes.

00:36.142 --> 00:36.442
Really?

00:36.803 --> 00:37.215
Yeah!

00:37.881 --> 00:38.654
Would you like a crisp?

00:39.165 --> 00:41.530
Crisps? In the States, they're chips!

00:41.800 --> 00:46.139
Oh. So, if I want to order our chips in America, what do I ask for?

00:46.635 --> 00:47.670
French fries!

00:47.915 --> 00:48.277
I see.

00:48.685 --> 00:49.875
And you know what that is, don't you?

00:50.051 --> 00:50.807
A fizzy drink.

00:51.062 --> 00:51.859
That's a soda!

00:53.209 --> 00:54.255
You know the lift over there?

00:54.908 --> 00:55.127
Yeah?

00:55.345 --> 00:56.295
That's an elevator.

00:56.835 --> 00:57.453
Oh, really?

00:58.029 --> 01:00.129
You know, in the States, you don't go to watch a film.

01:00.548 --> 01:01.477
You watch a movie!

01:01.844 --> 01:03.879
Exactly! And you don't walk on the pavement.

01:04.005 --> 01:05.090
You walk on the sidewalk!

01:05.306 --> 01:06.001
You got it!

01:06.566 --> 01:09.101
I've watched a lot of films. Oops, movies.
