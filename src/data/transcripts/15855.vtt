00:02.767 --> 00:04.771
If you are, you breathe.

00:06.135 --> 00:08.590
If you breathe, you talk.

00:09.508 --> 00:11.583
If you talk, you ask.

00:12.905 --> 00:15.045
If you ask, you think.

00:17.535 --> 00:19.385
If you think, you search.

00:21.398 --> 00:23.848
If you search, you experience.

00:25.395 --> 00:27.161
If you experience, you learn.

00:28.072 --> 00:30.295
If you learn, you grow.

00:31.319 --> 00:33.368
If you grow, you wish.

00:34.238 --> 00:36.109
If you wish, you find.

00:36.607 --> 00:41.481
And if you find, you doubt.

00:42.337 --> 00:43.965
If you doubt, you question.

00:44.179 --> 00:46.707
If you question, you understand.

00:47.254 --> 00:49.843
And if you understand, you know.

00:50.177 --> 00:52.110
If you know, you want to know more.

00:52.201 --> 00:54.830
And if you want to know more, you are alive!

00:55.675 --> 00:58.335
National Geographic Channel. Live curious.
