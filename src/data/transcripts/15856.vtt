There is a word, so small and so powerful,...

00:04.506 --> 00:06.891
...that we use all of our lives to make sense of the world.

00:09.550 --> 00:10.575
Why is he up there?

00:11.765 --> 00:12.909
Why is he down there?

00:13.813 --> 00:14.979
Why is that so big?

00:16.172 --> 00:17.437
Why is that so small?

00:18.555 --> 00:19.960
Why are they in such a rush?

00:20.831 --> 00:21.644
Why aren't they?

00:22.274 --> 00:24.847
It's such a simple word that unlocks many doors.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.114
Everything deserves a why.

00:34.255 --> 00:35.912
The world is a magnificent puzzle.

00:36.808 --> 00:38.319
It is beautiful and cruel,...

00:38.758 --> 00:40.239
...frightening and inspiring.

00:42.369 --> 00:42.855
Why?

00:43.978 --> 00:47.159
If we don't ask that, we'll never find out.
