00:00.657 --> 00:02.643
This is a plug.

00:03.689 --> 00:07.643
And last year, research revealed that eight out of ten modern men...

00:07.769 --> 00:11.180
...are not entirely sure how to wire it up.

00:11.833 --> 00:14.101
And this is where man finds himself these days.

00:14.311 --> 00:16.192
10,000 years in the making,...

00:16.446 --> 00:21.324
...10,000 years of endeavor in science and the arts and the humanities...

00:21.567 --> 00:22.885
...and within one generation,...

00:23.173 --> 00:28.454
...he's been reduced to a feckless, bed-wetting, Parmesan-shaving imbecile...

00:28.725 --> 00:30.721
...who revels in his own uselessness.

00:31.209 --> 00:33.107
Something has to be done.

00:56.707 --> 00:57.682
Welcome to Man Lab,...

00:58.000 --> 01:03.941
...the grueling arena in which the terminal decline of man will be arrested and possibly even reversed.

01:04.310 --> 01:10.091
In this humble industrial building, we will revive and relearn the skills that defined man.

01:10.342 --> 01:15.745
And drag them, glittering, onto a broad, sunlit upland of being a proper chap.

01:16.917 --> 01:19.201
Well, we'll be doing some woodwork, anyway and maybe a bit of plumbing.

01:21.573 --> 01:27.415
Man Lab is the workshop where we kick-start the stalled evolution of the male species.

01:29.796 --> 01:34.214
It's a bloke's base camp for an epic assault on the north face of Mount Ignorance.

01:34.508 --> 01:37.046
A repository of ingenuity and invention...

01:37.357 --> 01:39.935
...where man can emerge blinking yet triumphant,...

01:40.254 --> 01:44.275
...armed with only a decent tool kit and a slim volume of English poetry.

01:46.381 --> 01:49.692
Man Lab is a hallowed place where things get done properly.

01:50.011 --> 01:52.859
And a chap can still enjoy a half-decent pint.

01:53.273 --> 01:54.050
It's excellent.

01:54.745 --> 02:01.219
In this series, we sweep away the confusion that has reigned since the coming of moisturizer and the male makeover...

02:01.603 --> 02:04.912
...and guide us back onto the true path of enlightenment.
