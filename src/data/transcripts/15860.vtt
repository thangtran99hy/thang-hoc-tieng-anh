00:01.654 --> 00:04.548
Another episode of the historical melodrama,...

00:04.732 --> 00:06.620
..."Gye Baek" rolls off the production line.

00:07.090 --> 00:09.967
One of many Korean soaps that are hugely popular,...

00:10.319 --> 00:12.988
...not just here but right across Asia and beyond.

00:13.587 --> 00:17.570
During downtime in filming, drama sets like this one in Seoul...

00:17.797 --> 00:22.013
...become tourist attractions and the actors, objects of adulation.

00:28.385 --> 00:31.567
Period dramas in Korea have established wide fan bases.

00:31.893 --> 00:36.754
It is very popular because of all generations and other people who are keen on history.

00:38.688 --> 00:41.139
For you to get some idea of the sheer scale,...

00:41.312 --> 00:44.245
...the importance of these dramas to the audiences,...

00:44.701 --> 00:47.925
...well think Bollywood, think Brazilian soap operas,...

00:48.000 --> 00:50.236
...telenovelas and you're halfway there.

00:50.741 --> 00:51.980
This is huge.

00:57.167 --> 01:00.523
Korean dramas have struck a chord especially with Japanese audiences...

01:00.778 --> 01:03.370
...who appreciate their romantic side and nostalgia...

01:03.877 --> 01:06.175
...and so soap operas have triggered the first...

01:06.269 --> 01:10.211
...of the so-called Korean waves in a decade-long charm offensive.

01:10.679 --> 01:16.227
One soap won a record-breaking 86 percent of TV audience share in Iran.

01:19.593 --> 01:21.176
For the first time in its history,...

01:21.514 --> 01:25.171
...Korea is becoming a major exporter of popular culture.

01:30.079 --> 01:34.086
And after a torrid 20th century which saw Japanese occupation,...

01:34.445 --> 01:36.679
...destruction of much of the cities' heritage...

01:37.049 --> 01:41.887
...and a punishing civil war, South Koreans are very proud of their meteoric rise.

01:42.392 --> 01:45.725
The economy and creative industries are thriving.

01:46.677 --> 01:50.409
South Korea in the past was so inward-looking and closed,...

01:50.902 --> 01:53.644
...it was known as the hermit kingdom of Asia.

01:54.303 --> 01:58.372
Now, it seems that the shyest kid in class is the most popular.

02:00.028 --> 02:02.691
Tourism, I think, it's a really new thing for Korea...

02:03.526 --> 02:06.149
...maybe ten years ago. I don't think anyone came here for tourism.

02:06.543 --> 02:09.994
And I came here for the World Cup in 2002 but other than that,...

02:10.245 --> 02:13.545
...other than that specific event, people didn't really come here just for fun.

02:14.009 --> 02:16.694
But now it's changing because of these TV shows...

02:17.041 --> 02:19.575
...especially for people in other Asian countries like...

02:19.667 --> 02:21.945
...China, like Thailand, like Japan.

02:23.782 --> 02:26.163
Last year, nine million people visited Korea,...

02:26.489 --> 02:30.410
...the biggest group are the Chinese who made South Korea their favorite destination.

02:30.977 --> 02:34.595
Many are converted by the popularity of "Hallyu" in their homeland.

02:38.384 --> 02:42.069
We've seen a 46 percent increase in the number of foreign tourists to Korea...

02:42.286 --> 02:43.593
...over the past five years.

02:43.985 --> 02:46.319
China and Japan only saw a 10 percent increase,...

02:46.599 --> 02:49.766
...so 46 percent growth is an amazing achievement.

02:52.811 --> 02:57.098
After the initial success of soaps, Korean pop music or K-pop...

02:57.432 --> 02:58.779
...became the so-called second wave.

02:59.094 --> 03:02.755
Suddenly, teenagers from China and Japan were addicted.

03:05.217 --> 03:09.151
This time, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism were determined not to miss the boat.

03:09.575 --> 03:13.080
They created a whole TV channel devoted to peddling Hallyu...

03:13.372 --> 03:15.969
...to Japan, China and a growing global market.

03:19.418 --> 03:22.715
It is propaganda; we can say it is propaganda but it's the only tool...

03:22.783 --> 03:25.703
...they can actually find right now to promote Korea...

03:25.911 --> 03:27.035
...to the rest of the world. I guess.

03:27.641 --> 03:31.268
In the end, how cool is something if the government is promoting it?

03:32.914 --> 03:35.855
It maybe destroys the impact in some way.

03:40.698 --> 03:44.839
At regular events like this one at the Olympic stadium in Seoul...

03:45.123 --> 03:49.550
...sponsored by a big Korean company, fans young and old are clearly enchanted.

04:00.909 --> 04:09.985
We are from Japan and we love K-pop and we came to see the 2PM.

04:12.620 --> 04:19.361
We have grown up with Korean music and it reflects images of our relationships; our thoughts and beliefs.

04:19.492 --> 04:26.919
So yeah, we love it. But I'm still curious why it's so popular among foreigners.

04:29.061 --> 04:31.925
And the bandwagon continues with a new lease of life.

04:32.417 --> 04:35.609
Hallyu is breaking in Europe with financial support...

04:35.819 --> 04:38.705
...from the Korean Ministry of Culture and some major companies.
