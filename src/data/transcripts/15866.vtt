00:00.033 --> 00:02.452
So, we agree that banking is about money.

00:03.476 --> 00:06.172
But finance is also about money.

00:07.218 --> 00:10.594
Does this mean that banking and finance are the same?

00:11.573 --> 00:12.249
Not really.

00:13.103 --> 00:19.298
Banks are financial institutions but so are insurance companies and investment companies.

00:20.248 --> 00:26.253
Some financial institutions provide banking services, but they cannot be defined as a bank.

00:27.169 --> 00:27.587
Why not?

00:28.575 --> 00:32.168
Because they do not fulfill the legal definition of a bank.

00:33.071 --> 00:40.125
In Britain, all financial institutions are controlled by the Financial Services Authority or FSA.

00:41.118 --> 00:45.114
There is legislation covering the services provided by each institution.

00:45.694 --> 00:48.792
A bank is a government-licensed institution.

00:49.657 --> 00:52.037
It is established under a government charter.

00:53.029 --> 00:57.038
A banking license gives the right to conduct banking services,...

00:57.359 --> 01:00.821
...particularly services related to the storing or keeping...

01:01.185 --> 01:04.848
...of deposits and the extending or offering of credit.
