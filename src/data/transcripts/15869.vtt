00:01.799 --> 00:02.639
Good morning, everyone.

00:03.625 --> 00:08.973
To start with, I'm going to talk about how we can assess the financial strength of a bank.

00:09.989 --> 00:11.515
What do we mean by strength?

00:12.133 --> 00:13.170
How do we measure this?

00:13.954 --> 00:16.495
Well, we can look at a comparative analysis;...

00:17.205 --> 00:20.191
...that is, how the particular bank compares with other banks,..

00:20.848 --> 00:23.925
...or how it compares with its own performance in previous years.

00:25.275 --> 00:29.957
In this lecture, I'm going to focus on individual bank performance and...

00:30.357 --> 00:33.925
...the bank we will be looking at is the ANW Bank.

00:35.072 --> 00:37.800
I'll use the financial accounts in the shareholders' report,...

00:38.457 --> 00:40.741
...which contains two tables of interest to us.

00:41.769 --> 00:47.404
These are the statement of financial performance and the statement of financial position.

00:48.481 --> 00:52.767
While both these documents provide different information on the bank's financial strength,...

00:53.361 --> 00:57.111
...the statement of financial position is arguably the document...

00:57.295 --> 00:59.915
...for understanding the state of the bank's finances.

01:01.361 --> 01:04.273
The main discussion will be on the statement of financial position.

01:05.403 --> 01:09.809
Firstly, I'll define exactly what a statement of financial position is.

01:10.605 --> 01:14.669
Then I'll briefly go over the categories included in a statement of financial position.

01:15.749 --> 01:18.337
I'll start with assets followed by liabilities.

01:19.123 --> 01:20.671
After that, I'll look at equity.

01:22.005 --> 01:25.887
Finally, I'll talk briefly about the statement of financial performance.

01:26.620 --> 01:30.250
This shows the movements in income, expenditure and profit...

01:30.951 --> 01:34.001
...which have taken place since the end of the previous accounting period.

01:34.674 --> 01:38.137
In other words, it shows the trading results for 12 months.
