Travel is one aspect of tourism, but you don't go somewhere just to come back.

00:09.429 --> 00:13.082
Another important point, and this is the sixth aspect of Leiper's theory,...

00:13.529 --> 00:17.187
...is that you will engage in leisure-related experiences.

00:17.903 --> 00:18.958
These are nonobligatory.

00:19.068 --> 00:19.971
You don't have to do them.

00:20.635 --> 00:24.391
They are personally pleasurable, recreational, or creative.

00:25.062 --> 00:27.358
You may, for instance, decide to go snorkeling,...

00:27.688 --> 00:29.919
...lounge on the beach or have a massage.

00:30.698 --> 00:34.071
To a certain degree, tourism has to do with leisure,...

00:34.283 --> 00:37.749
...which is why we often see leisure incorporated into tourism courses...

00:37.831 --> 00:39.098
...as well as hospitality.

00:40.229 --> 00:43.604
Whether we're talking about travel, leisure, or hospitality,...

00:43.965 --> 00:47.495
...all tourism shows the culture of the generating regions...

00:47.780 --> 00:52.755
...and most tourism involves a cultural exchange in the destination region.

00:53.773 --> 00:55.615
This is aspect number seven.

00:56.610 --> 00:59.777
As a tourist, you engage with a different culture.

01:00.033 --> 01:02.521
You're away from your own culture for a while.

01:03.103 --> 01:06.641
This gives rise to a lot of interesting theories about cultural exchange,...

01:06.941 --> 01:11.301
...learning more about yourself and learning more about the culture you go to.

01:11.959 --> 01:14.665
People often say that travel broadens the mind.
