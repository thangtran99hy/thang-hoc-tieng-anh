Okay class, let's quickly review Europe.

00:05.005 --> 00:08.633
Can anyone tell me what country this island is?

00:10.185 --> 00:10.622
Noah?

00:10.903 --> 00:11.503
Ireland?

00:11.931 --> 00:12.702
Very good.

00:13.442 --> 00:16.977
And just under that we have a continent. Who knows what continent it is?

00:42.587 --> 00:43.408
Uh, William?

00:43.901 --> 00:45.765
Can you tell us what's so interesting out the window?

00:46.773 --> 00:48.337
Okay, pay attention this time. Okay?

01:14.515 --> 01:14.965
Can I help you?

01:16.380 --> 01:17.966
Yeah, do you have the new 911?

01:19.329 --> 01:20.327
Yeah, it's right over here.

01:25.339 --> 01:26.021
You wanna get in?

01:26.937 --> 01:27.219
Really?

01:27.869 --> 01:28.007
Sure.

01:53.135 --> 01:54.209
Do you have a business card?

01:54.943 --> 01:55.322
Sure.

02:01.557 --> 02:01.919
Thanks.

02:05.079 --> 02:06.799
I'll see you in about 20 years.

02:15.220 --> 02:16.906
It's a funny thing about a Porsche.

02:17.827 --> 02:19.481
There's the moment you know you want one.

02:20.033 --> 02:21.831
There's the moment you first own one.

02:22.355 --> 02:26.315
And for the truly afflicted, there's the decade or two that passes in between.

02:27.177 --> 02:29.563
From its first days on the road over 40 years ago,...

02:30.015 --> 02:33.999
...the 911 has ignited the kind of passion in drivers that only a Porsche can.

02:34.855 --> 02:38.024
And now once again, it is poised to redefine what's possible.

02:38.911 --> 02:41.310
Introducing the new 911 Carrera.

02:42.046 --> 02:45.862
It is quite simply the purest expression of who we are.

02:57.451 --> 02:57.842
Porsche.

02:58.544 --> 02:59.985
There is no substitute.
