There are definitely, you know,...

00:05.653 --> 00:09.974
...there are definitely these relationships in your life that...

00:10.740 --> 00:14.227
...or in my life that have stuck with me forever and ever,...

00:14.671 --> 00:18.625
...and I'm sure will be with me until the day I die.

00:21.274 --> 00:26.461
And every now and then, I'll make a new friend and I'll think, you know,...

00:27.854 --> 00:28.904
..."Do I really have..."

00:29.399 --> 00:33.613
"...do I really have what it takes to take you on board as a new friend?"...

00:33.957 --> 00:35.332
...and "Is this gonna be worth it?"

00:36.132 --> 00:42.156
And, you know, particularly at my age, "Are you worth taking on board?"

00:44.021 --> 00:46.191
And you know, you gotta take a chance on people...

00:47.797 --> 00:49.460
...because they're taking a chance on you.
