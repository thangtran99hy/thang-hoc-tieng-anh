ï»¿In general, it's like,...

00:07.454 --> 00:10.511
...you find something awesome and the first thing you wanna do is talk about it with someone.

00:11.489 --> 00:15.034
Like, I don't think anyone necessarily shares things because they think someone else will love it.

00:16.055 --> 00:20.645
And, the friends you have are kind of the ones that allow you...

00:20.745 --> 00:24.903
...to like geek out about the things that you are absolutely passionate about.

00:25.198 --> 00:26.713
And that's the reason you stay friends with them,...

00:27.255 --> 00:29.803
...is not because you're talking about things with them,...

00:30.095 --> 00:31.824
...to talk about things that interest them.

00:31.923 --> 00:35.229
It's because it interests you and you're absolutely passionate about it,...

00:35.780 --> 00:41.492
...and they have enough of a commonality to let you explore it.

00:41.594 --> 00:43.751
And that's where having a friend comes in. That's what fun about it,...

00:43.849 --> 00:48.556
...is kind of like, nerding-out and exploring a subject together.
