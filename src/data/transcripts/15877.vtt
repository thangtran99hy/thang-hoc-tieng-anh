ï»¿Hello, everybody!

00:01.705 --> 00:04.728
I wanna congratulate the American Cancer Society and everyone...

00:04.877 --> 00:07.876
...who's taking part in this year's Great American Smokeout.

00:08.814 --> 00:12.733
Over the years, we've made great progress in reducing the number of Americans who smoke.

00:13.461 --> 00:16.413
But today, 46 million Americans are still hooked,...

00:16.969 --> 00:20.951
...and tobacco remains the leading cause of preventable early deaths in this country.

00:21.812 --> 00:23.685
Fact is, quitting smoking is hard.

00:24.460 --> 00:25.587
Believe me, I know.

00:26.306 --> 00:27.387
But we can make it easier,...

00:27.693 --> 00:31.738
...which is why we have resources available through the Department of Health and Human Services...

00:32.073 --> 00:37.168
...at HHS.gov to help more Americans put down cigarettes for good.

00:38.221 --> 00:41.929
We also know that the best way to prevent the health problems that come with smoking,...

00:42.293 --> 00:44.576
...is to keep young people from starting in the first place.

00:45.351 --> 00:51.183
That's why in 2009, I was proud to sign the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act...

00:51.543 --> 00:55.010
...which gives us new tools to keep cigarettes out of the hands of our kids,..

00:55.579 --> 01:00.860
...including new warning labels that make sure that anyone who buys a pack of cigarettes is aware of the risk.

01:02.003 --> 01:05.227
Today, some big tobacco companies are trying to block these labels...

01:05.343 --> 01:08.616
...because they don't wanna be honest about the consequences of using their products.

01:09.037 --> 01:10.867
Unfortunately, this isn't surprising.

01:11.433 --> 01:14.937
We've always known that the fight to stop smoking in this country won't be easy,...

01:15.659 --> 01:18.784
...but it's people like all of you who make me confident that together...

01:19.327 --> 01:23.851
...we can help Americans everywhere live longer, happier, and healthier lives.
