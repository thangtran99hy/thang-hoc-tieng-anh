A tourist, according to the World Tourism Organization, a United Nations body,...

00:08.791 --> 00:14.705
...is someone who travels at least 80 kilometers from home for the purpose of recreation.

00:16.399 --> 00:20.655
A wider definition is that tourism is a service industry.

00:21.682 --> 00:24.745
It covers a number of tangible and intangible aspects.

00:25.889 --> 00:33.125
The tangible aspects are transport systems: air, rail, road, water and now, space.

00:34.311 --> 00:41.483
Other examples are hospitality services: accommodation, foods and beverages, tours, souvenirs.

00:42.629 --> 00:47.081
And then there are services such as banking, insurance and security.

00:48.324 --> 00:55.545
Examples of intangible elements are rest and relaxation, culture, escape, adventure.

00:56.547 --> 00:58.453
These are the things you experience.

00:59.291 --> 01:04.837
The intangible aspects of tourism are perhaps even more important than the tangible ones.
