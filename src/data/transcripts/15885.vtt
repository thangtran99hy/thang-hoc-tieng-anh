I would like to take this opportunity to welcome you to the Faculty of Language Studies.

00:08.807 --> 00:14.861
Before I introduce you to the tutors in this faculty, I want to ask two basic questions.

00:15.734 --> 00:16.825
What is a language?

00:17.463 --> 00:19.296
And what is linguistics?

00:20.134 --> 00:22.431
Firstly, what is a language?

00:23.326 --> 00:26.098
Well, everybody knows that English is a language...

00:26.511 --> 00:29.909
...and that Spanish and Japanese are others in this category.

00:30.725 --> 00:35.562
But we also know that English is not used in the same way in New York as it is in London.

00:36.387 --> 00:40.276
You may also know that English is not used in the same way in London...

00:40.641 --> 00:43.775
...as it is in the north of England, say, or the west of England.

00:44.665 --> 00:48.014
So English is a language, but it has many varieties.

00:48.857 --> 00:53.490
We could say there are many "Englishes" just as there are many "Spanishes."

00:54.339 --> 01:00.768
The intrinsic meaning of language is a shared system of expression particular to a nation or people.

01:01.441 --> 01:04.467
But in fact, one language can have many varieties,...

01:04.984 --> 01:10.469
...for example, British English, American English, Cockney, which is London English,...

01:11.015 --> 01:15.013
...Scouse, which is English spoken by people from Liverpool, and so on.

01:16.064 --> 01:21.439
What is French to a businessman in Paris is not the same French used by an old woman in Lyon.

01:22.279 --> 01:26.259
You can be sure that it will be very different to that of a teenage boy in Quebec.
