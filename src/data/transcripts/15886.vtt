So, to sum up, what is language and what is linguistics?

00:09.739 --> 00:13.785
Language is a unique and organic communication system.

00:14.433 --> 00:17.594
It is unique because it is only humans who possess it.

00:18.223 --> 00:21.832
It is organic because it grows and changes all the time,...

00:21.894 --> 00:23.964
...just like a plant or any organism.

00:25.027 --> 00:28.838
Language can also be defined through its key design features.

00:29.639 --> 00:35.432
It is unique because of its close relationship with the human mind, the brain, and society.

00:36.619 --> 00:37.713
What about linguistics?

00:38.462 --> 00:42.838
The role of linguistics is to analyze and explain language.

00:43.535 --> 00:45.001
But we can go further than that.

00:45.445 --> 00:49.457
Linguistics is also the study of the way language is used in everyday life,...

00:49.806 --> 00:51.183
...the way it is employed.
