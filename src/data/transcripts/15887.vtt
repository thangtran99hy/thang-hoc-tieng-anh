00:02.800 --> 00:04.750
There is also the problem of jury selection.

00:06.066 --> 00:08.326
Sitting on a jury is both a right and a duty.

00:09.899 --> 00:14.438
Jurors are selected at random from people who are entitled to vote, who are under the age of 70.

00:16.268 --> 00:20.245
The advantage of this is that, in theory, juries are composed of people...

00:20.590 --> 00:23.019
...who come from a very wide spectrum of society.

00:24.503 --> 00:27.121
Unfortunately, many people try to avoid their duty...

00:27.217 --> 00:30.113
...because they claim they are too busy at work or will lose their salary.

00:31.685 --> 00:35.947
As a result, juries, it is argued, have too many people with time,...

00:36.162 --> 00:40.006
...such as unemployed and retired people, to provide a good balance.

00:42.441 --> 00:44.221
Let us go back to the role of the jury.

00:45.189 --> 00:49.134
In a trial, the jury's function is to decide on the facts of the case.

00:49.965 --> 00:52.187
The jurors are there to determine the truth.

00:53.417 --> 00:55.842
However, many cases have a highly emotive element...

00:56.309 --> 00:59.896
...and this can, it is argued, sway the jury away from the facts.

01:01.944 --> 01:04.939
Should emotion have a place in a court of law?

01:06.151 --> 01:09.505
Can a group of twelve ordinary men and women provide a fair trial...

01:09.947 --> 01:13.643
...and reach the correct verdict any better or worse than trained lawyers?

01:15.505 --> 01:18.602
The government is keen to abolish trial by jury for some crimes...

01:19.435 --> 01:22.296
...but surprisingly perhaps, the legal profession is not.

01:23.415 --> 01:26.187
This, I think, is because we have an adversarial system...

01:26.576 --> 01:29.263
...where lawyers need to argue the case against each other.
