00:02.684 --> 00:03.988
So, to summarize.

00:04.906 --> 00:08.179
In the English legal system, there are three different types of court:...

00:08.915 --> 00:13.931
...civil courts, criminal courts and tribunals which act as courts.

00:15.586 --> 00:18.589
We have looked at the cases that are likely to be heard in each type of court.

00:19.713 --> 00:23.787
Trespass is a tort and the plaintiff will sue in the civil courts.

00:25.320 --> 00:30.827
Assault can be both a crime and a tort; and the case could be brought in either the civil court...

00:31.133 --> 00:33.720
...or the criminal court, depending on the circumstances.

00:35.603 --> 00:38.893
In a civil case of assault, the plaintiff will sue for damages...

00:39.239 --> 00:43.517
...while in a criminal case, the police might charge a person with grievous bodily harm.

00:45.208 --> 00:50.095
Theft is a crime and cases of theft are heard in the criminal courts.

00:51.734 --> 00:56.632
Tribunals which act as courts and have a judicial rather than administrative function...

00:56.913 --> 00:59.229
...include the Employment Appeal Tribunal.

01:00.308 --> 01:04.659
This tribunal would hear cases of wrongful dismissal by an employer, for example.

01:05.951 --> 01:07.524
Okay, that's it for today.

01:08.299 --> 01:11.255
Next time, we'll look in detail at trespass to the person.

01:12.425 --> 01:14.557
And don't forget to do a bit of research on that before you come.

01:15.426 --> 01:15.725
Thanks.

01:16.249 --> 01:16.694
See you soon.
