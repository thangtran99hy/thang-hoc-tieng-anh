The AIDS pandemic can seem massive and overwhelming,...

00:07.381 --> 00:12.814
...but the fact is, that it is solvable. It is containable. It is stoppable.

00:13.555 --> 00:16.145
We are already engaged in that process.

00:16.566 --> 00:21.692
Through the work of Dignitas and through the work of many many other organizations that we touch through our policy work,...

00:22.270 --> 00:26.393
...we are having an impact for the first time in the course of the epidemic.

00:26.539 --> 00:28.949
We're actually seeing a very significant drop...

00:29.658 --> 00:34.565
...in the incidents of new cases of HIV in the developing world.

00:34.989 --> 00:40.027
And people participate in the Give a Day campaign, when they actually give a day's pay to this campaign.

00:40.603 --> 00:42.399
The outcomes are very, very significant.

00:42.839 --> 00:47.683
It means concretely that there are people who will live because of what you've done.

00:47.864 --> 00:53.110
It means concretely that there is new, good research that is taking place because of what you have done.

00:53.653 --> 00:57.302
It means concretely that we are able to participate and to drive...

00:57.566 --> 01:01.264
...policy change processes that will affect greater and greater numbers of people.

01:01.789 --> 01:04.598
So, the give a day's pay through a Give a Day's campaign,...

01:04.809 --> 01:11.447
...it's a very, very powerful and concrete way of having an immediate impact beyond your own individual action.
