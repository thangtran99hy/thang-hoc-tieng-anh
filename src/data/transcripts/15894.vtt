00:02.077 --> 00:03.932
Seven billion and counting.

00:04.477 --> 00:06.551
Hi, everybody and I do mean everybody.

00:06.655 --> 00:08.047
Tim Minton at Buzz60.

00:08.569 --> 00:11.031
Earth's population has hit a stunning number.

00:11.477 --> 00:15.611
A hospital in the Philippines has already claimed to have produced the seven billionth baby.

00:15.775 --> 00:19.840
What we know is, five people are born every second somewhere,...

00:20.237 --> 00:22.344
...only two people die every second.

00:22.925 --> 00:24.802
The good news: there's plenty of room.

00:25.067 --> 00:28.121
National Geographic reports that if standing shoulder to shoulder,...

00:28.468 --> 00:30.751
...we would all fit into Los Angeles.

00:31.051 --> 00:34.727
But five percent of us, and you know who you are,...

00:35.102 --> 00:37.260
...use 25 percent of the world's energy.

00:37.445 --> 00:38.539
That's a problem.

00:39.104 --> 00:40.253
And consider this,...

00:40.718 --> 00:44.036
...the last billion people were added in barely a decade.

00:44.436 --> 00:50.340
Mathematicians estimate that to say all seven billion living names out loud would take 200 years.

00:50.567 --> 00:55.263
By which time at this rate, we'd have 17 billion new neighbors.

00:55.601 --> 00:56.362
All aboard.

00:56.543 --> 00:57.245
Buzz60.

00:57.433 --> 00:58.582
Now you know, pass it on.
