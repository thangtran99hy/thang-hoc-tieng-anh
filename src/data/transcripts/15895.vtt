00:03.660 --> 00:06.039
So, let me go back to my original question.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.167
What is environmental science?

00:10.158 --> 00:14.231
There are various branches that exist inside and outside of the field.

00:14.966 --> 00:20.321
These can be broadly categorized as atmospheric sciences, ecology,...

00:20.962 --> 00:26.409
...environmental chemistry, geosciences, and environmental assessment.

00:27.707 --> 00:32.769
Atmospheric science studies the phenomena of the Earth's gaseous outer layer...

00:33.173 --> 00:37.013
..with an emphasis on its relationship to other aspects of the biosphere.

00:37.977 --> 00:44.414
Ecology, at its most basic level, analyzes the dynamics of a species in a given area...

00:44.730 --> 00:46.596
...and some aspect of its environment.

00:47.675 --> 00:52.741
Environmental chemistry focuses on chemical alterations in the environment...

00:53.201 --> 00:56.115
...including soil contamination and water pollution.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.738
The next branch is the geosciences.

01:00.707 --> 01:06.859
These include disciplines such as geology, physical geography, and geomorphology.

01:07.987 --> 01:13.105
The last branch is environmental assessment, which is a process of appraisal...

01:13.199 --> 01:17.740
...through which environmental protection and sustainable development are considered.

01:18.810 --> 01:23.866
So, what is the basic approach that differentiates them from the earth sciences...

01:24.217 --> 01:27.941
...and binds them together as environmental science subjects?
