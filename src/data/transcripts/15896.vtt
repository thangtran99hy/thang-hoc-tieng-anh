Let me suggest that the phrase "human activity" is a common factor that connects all the disciplines together...

00:10.349 --> 00:12.798
...under the umbrella of environmental science.

00:13.687 --> 00:14.712
What do I mean by this?

00:15.607 --> 00:22.842
Well, as I mentioned before, the earth sciences and environmental science overlap to some extent.

00:23.657 --> 00:27.860
Both of them deal with process and change in our natural environment.

00:28.742 --> 00:34.777
However, environmental science is principally concerned with changes made by human activity...

00:35.288 --> 00:37.854
...and the subsequent implications for the ecosphere.

00:38.954 --> 00:45.719
So, environmental science exists as a body of knowledge where specialists work together...

00:46.019 --> 00:50.277
...to address a particular problem that has been created by human activity.

00:51.190 --> 00:56.364
This separates it from the earth sciences, which focus on process and change...

00:56.439 --> 01:01.257
...within the natural environment without the added factor of human intervention.

01:02.439 --> 01:09.159
Let me illustrate this by giving you a brief example of how environmental scientists work together.

01:10.213 --> 01:14.176
Perhaps there is a problem over building new homes on a flood plain.

01:15.554 --> 01:20.530
There would be a comprehensive study of the issue to try and find a viable solution,...

01:21.160 --> 01:23.795
...and it would draw on a wide range of disciplines.

01:24.595 --> 01:29.458
It would involve the mapping of the solid geology of the rock underneath the proposed site.

01:30.874 --> 01:37.962
The scientists would identify the overlying sediments, measure and trace the flow and movement of water,...

01:38.884 --> 01:43.524
...and sample and record the species living in and around the site.

01:45.434 --> 01:49.234
The study would engage scientists from a wide range of disciplines,...

01:49.940 --> 01:53.825
...but their collaboration and focus on the effects of human activity...

01:54.333 --> 01:57.566
...would identify them as environmental scientists.

01:59.471 --> 02:05.773
So, to summarize, environmental science is the branch of biology concerned...

02:05.848 --> 02:09.323
...with the relationships between organisms and their environment,...

02:09.889 --> 02:12.823
...and the effect of human actions on these systems.

02:14.143 --> 02:16.709
Thank you and this concludes our lecture today.
