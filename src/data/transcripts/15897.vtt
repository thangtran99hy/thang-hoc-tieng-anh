00:02.985 --> 00:05.958
So far, we've established that fundamentally,...

00:06.245 --> 00:09.791
...PR aims to create understanding between different parties.

00:10.681 --> 00:13.765
Today, modern mass media is everywhere.

00:14.441 --> 00:18.675
Interest and pressure groups in politics and business are all around us.

00:19.709 --> 00:23.000
This means that the ability to influence public opinion...

00:23.114 --> 00:26.951
...and behavior is critical to the survival of organizations.

00:27.750 --> 00:32.895
This is particularly true for organizations seeking public attention, government support,...

00:33.217 --> 00:35.689
...funding or credibility in the community.

00:36.711 --> 00:40.921
Public relations plays a key role in developing, understanding...

00:41.007 --> 00:43.862
...and defining relationships between the different parties.

00:44.985 --> 00:50.799
It narrows the gap between an organization's perception of itself and how others perceive it.

00:52.157 --> 00:54.911
Communication plays a vital role in PR.

00:55.588 --> 01:00.600
PR practitioners use a variety of communication techniques to communicate with their publics.

01:01.561 --> 01:05.818
One of these is advertising, which is sometimes confused with PR.

01:06.729 --> 01:10.394
With advertising, the sponsor controls the words used,...

01:10.765 --> 01:14.283
...where and how often the advertisement is placed, and the cost.

01:15.005 --> 01:19.526
Advertising is limited specifically to products and services and brands,...

01:19.987 --> 01:22.045
...with the goal of generating sales.

01:22.875 --> 01:25.369
PR is much broader than advertising.

01:26.862 --> 01:30.395
Of course, publicity is a central aspect of PR.

01:31.441 --> 01:38.151
Publicity, in its broadest sense, refers to exposure in any public media of individuals,...

01:38.247 --> 01:41.215
...organizations, services or products.

01:42.057 --> 01:43.902
It can be positive or negative.

01:45.259 --> 01:50.463
Publicity is often used in PR, but in a more limited and defined sense.

01:51.266 --> 01:56.819
It refers to information communicated in the media, as news or items of public interest.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.661
In most cases, these are not paid for.

02:00.615 --> 02:05.985
Publicity, in a PR sense, is mainly about independent editorial coverage.

02:06.852 --> 02:11.691
The recipient of this publicity often has no, or very little control...

02:11.794 --> 02:15.261
...over the content and where or when it is received.
