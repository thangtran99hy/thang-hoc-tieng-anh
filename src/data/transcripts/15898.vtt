00:03.095 --> 00:06.159
As I've mentioned, the main focus of public relations...

00:06.400 --> 00:09.929
...is influencing a specific public at a specific time.

00:11.009 --> 00:15.295
I'd like to make a distinction between what can be termed the public at large,...

00:15.806 --> 00:19.599
...or the population as a whole, and segmented groups within it.

00:20.555 --> 00:27.199
In contemporary public relations, these segmented groups or publics are the focus of interest.

00:28.014 --> 00:31.557
They are audiences that are important to the organization, and that have...

00:32.021 --> 00:35.461
...or may potentially have an impact on an organization.

00:36.457 --> 00:42.287
They include customers, both current and potential; employees and management,...

00:43.027 --> 00:48.850
...investors, media, government, suppliers and opinion formers.

00:50.059 --> 00:52.373
Publics include groups of people who share...

00:52.456 --> 00:56.406
...a common perception of a situation or problem at a specific time.

00:56.895 --> 00:59.883
For example, men aged 30 to 40 years.

01:01.020 --> 01:04.056
They also include people who are connected by a common interest.

01:04.507 --> 01:06.153
For example, the reading public.

01:07.743 --> 01:11.309
But publics are not the only segmented group of the population.

01:11.891 --> 01:16.377
A population also includes markets, target groups and stakeholders.

01:17.387 --> 01:21.591
An organization identifies a group of potential buyers, or market,...

01:21.963 --> 01:23.879
...for a product or service they are offering.

01:24.728 --> 01:28.899
For example, all coffee drinkers form a market for coffee sellers.

01:30.095 --> 01:33.114
So how do a market and a public differ?

01:34.389 --> 01:38.457
One important difference is that markets are identified by the organization.

01:39.334 --> 01:44.054
Publics, however, are characterized by a common interest or shared concerns.

01:45.063 --> 01:49.598
Publics differ from one organization to another, are inherently active,...

01:50.185 --> 01:54.535
...and may choose an organization based on the way that organization works.

01:55.526 --> 01:57.263
So, just to go over that again.

01:58.075 --> 02:03.132
Organizations choose markets, but publics choose organizations.

02:05.183 --> 02:09.049
A target group constitutes another segment of the population as a whole.

02:09.741 --> 02:14.480
It is a very specific group of people an organization is trying to reach with its message.

02:15.606 --> 02:22.069
Also referred to as a target market, it is defined by measurable characteristics or attributes.

02:22.678 --> 02:25.357
For example, a particular socioeconomic group.

02:26.379 --> 02:30.062
Target groups are recipients of something and are basically passive,...

02:30.717 --> 02:34.843
...as opposed to people who are actively in the market for a product or service.

02:37.129 --> 02:38.478
What about stakeholders?

02:39.612 --> 02:44.338
The term refers to individuals or a group with an interest in an organization.

02:45.263 --> 02:50.592
Stakeholders can be categorized as those linked to an organization contractually or financially.

02:51.157 --> 02:55.459
For example, employees, management, investors, et cetera.

02:56.719 --> 03:00.975
Publics, on the other hand, are those existing outside the organization...

03:01.295 --> 03:03.289
...with no direct financial involvement.
