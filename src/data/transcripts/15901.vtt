"I'll Follow the Moon",...

00:04.871 --> 00:06.429
...written by Stephanie Lisa Tara,...

00:06.653 --> 00:08.602
...illustrated by Lee Edward Fodi.

00:17.298 --> 00:19.167
Warm, soft, dry.

00:19.903 --> 00:20.957
I dream in blue,...

00:21.280 --> 00:22.262
...shimmering yellow,...

00:22.400 --> 00:23.437
...and turquoise, too.

00:24.553 --> 00:25.504
I'm coming, Mama,...

00:25.765 --> 00:26.637
...I'll see you soon.

00:27.406 --> 00:28.670
I know just how,...

00:29.411 --> 00:30.341
...I'll follow the moon.

00:45.671 --> 00:46.536
Whoosh!

00:46.801 --> 00:47.505
Night!

00:47.999 --> 00:48.521
Kiss!

00:49.313 --> 00:52.557
I breathe in deep, salt air on my face.

00:53.177 --> 00:54.395
Turtle heart leap!

00:55.786 --> 00:56.713
I'm coming, Mama,...

00:56.896 --> 00:57.859
...I'll see you soon.

00:58.028 --> 00:59.114
I know just how,...

00:59.307 --> 01:00.435
...I'll follow the moon.

01:14.371 --> 01:17.423
Eyes like mine...

01:17.923 --> 01:19.056
...of deepest blue.

01:19.511 --> 01:20.954
Shell to shell we go...

01:21.233 --> 01:22.409
...in love anew.

01:22.968 --> 01:24.745
I'm here, Mama, here with you.

01:25.417 --> 01:26.975
I knew I'd find you.

01:27.395 --> 01:28.517
Moon did, too.
