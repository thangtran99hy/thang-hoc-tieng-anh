00:08.604 --> 00:09.545
It's not a human being.

00:10.230 --> 00:11.705
It's a blight of nature.

00:16.248 --> 00:18.483
I was held captive for 12 years.

00:21.904 --> 00:23.574
Subject two escaped. It's somewhere in the building.

00:23.968 --> 00:24.283
Now.

00:24.368 --> 00:24.786
Freeze!

00:24.983 --> 00:27.147
Humans hunt the lycans and vampires.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.397
This is a new war.

00:36.350 --> 00:37.795
I used to hear stories of the death eaters.

00:39.044 --> 00:42.085
But they were a thing of the past, never to return.

00:42.640 --> 00:43.897
I don't recognize this world.

00:45.642 --> 00:48.929
We've lived safely for years and now you've brought humans into this coven.

00:50.121 --> 00:51.679
We stand and we fight.

00:54.040 --> 00:55.728
Lycans!

01:06.665 --> 01:07.884
Something else escaped.

01:12.423 --> 01:14.755
Whatever it is, it's more powerful than any of us.

01:27.630 --> 01:28.635
Where is Michael?
