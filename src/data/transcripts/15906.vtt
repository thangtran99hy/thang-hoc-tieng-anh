00:04.933 --> 00:06.208
My name is Desmond Miles.

00:06.970 --> 00:09.628
Just months ago, I was pouring shots for the rich and famous.

00:09.908 --> 00:11.863
Until my life took an unbelievable turn.

00:12.774 --> 00:16.925
Abstergo, a secretive tech corporation and a front for modern-day Templars,...

00:17.448 --> 00:20.036
...kidnapped me and forced me into one of their inventions:...

00:20.359 --> 00:21.001
...the Animus.

00:21.981 --> 00:25.552
Decades ago, Abstergo discovered that our DNA contains memories.

00:26.155 --> 00:29.078
Not just our own memories, but those of our ancestors.

00:29.825 --> 00:34.916
They built the Animus to unravel these genetic traces and allow us to relive forgotten lives.

00:35.827 --> 00:40.115
Inside, I was confronted by a truth I thought I'd escaped long ago:...

00:40.935 --> 00:42.157
...I am an Assassin;...

00:43.165 --> 00:46.533
...part of a group dedicated for protecting free will against the Templars,...

00:47.036 --> 00:50.796
...an organization as old as history which aims to control the world.

00:52.198 --> 00:55.200
First, I relived the memories of Altair Ibn-La'Ahad,...

00:55.939 --> 00:58.357
...stoic 12th century assassin from the holy land.

00:59.240 --> 01:05.031
I discovered the Apple of Eden, a strange and powerful artifact at the center of our war against the Templars.

01:06.153 --> 01:09.899
Next, I was Ezio Auditore, a 15th century Italian.

01:10.559 --> 01:13.803
I got to know him well as I lived his rise from charismatic playboy,...

01:14.319 --> 01:16.565
...grief stricken assassin on a mission of vengeance.

01:17.817 --> 01:21.277
And finally, as the legendary master and leader of his order.

01:22.176 --> 01:25.946
After another encounter with the Apple, I was contacted by its creators:...

01:26.579 --> 01:30.559
...the first civilization, an advanced race from beyond human history.

01:31.136 --> 01:34.133
They spoke of a great disaster that destroyed their people.

01:34.511 --> 01:37.239
A tragedy set to reoccur in 2012...

01:38.007 --> 01:40.296
...and then, everything went dark.

01:42.085 --> 01:45.287
Now, I'm trapped in the Animus, my memories fragmented.

01:46.900 --> 01:49.997
To escape, I must return to the final memories of Ezio,...

01:50.229 --> 01:52.500
...who is on the most important journey of his life.

01:54.629 --> 02:00.267
Against the Templars, he searches for messages left behind by Altair buried deep in Masyaf.

02:01.236 --> 02:02.861
They will be crucial to my destiny,...

02:04.019 --> 02:04.932
...and that of humanity.

02:06.068 --> 02:09.152
What fate intends for this world, I don't know.

02:10.193 --> 02:12.118
But the answers are locked deep in my bloodline.

02:13.285 --> 02:14.925
Where these three lives converge,...

02:15.733 --> 02:17.384
...I only hope to find them soon enough...

02:18.285 --> 02:19.079
...to save us all.
