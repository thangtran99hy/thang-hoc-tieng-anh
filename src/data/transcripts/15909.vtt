Guys, I'm so amped I could stay here for three weeks.

00:03.290 --> 00:06.962
Nine hours down and we're almost in the door.

00:07.053 --> 00:08.083
I think two people just left.

00:08.353 --> 00:10.483
Why would they be leaving when we're only nine hours away?

00:10.623 --> 00:11.533
Yeah I mean, this is an event!

00:12.512 --> 00:14.225
Uh-oh, blogs are saying the battery looks sketchy!

00:14.550 --> 00:16.843
If it looks the same, how will people know I upgraded?

00:16.959 --> 00:18.359
Is it 4G? Is it 4G? It doesn't say! It doesn't say!

00:18.775 --> 00:21.095
Whoa! What has she got there?

00:21.648 --> 00:22.350
Not sure.

00:23.135 --> 00:23.699
What is that?

00:24.398 --> 00:25.490
Guys, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:25.889 --> 00:27.374
Hey bro, could we see your phone?

00:27.615 --> 00:28.111
Um, sure.

00:28.533 --> 00:29.241
Can I see it with my hands?

00:29.413 --> 00:30.115
Have you seen this thing?

00:31.109 --> 00:31.275
Oh!

00:31.380 --> 00:33.075
Check out the screen, this thing is huge.

00:33.186 --> 00:33.723
It's pretty massive.

00:33.883 --> 00:35.075
And it's got 4G speed.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.062
It's magnificent.

00:37.259 --> 00:37.948
Samsung.

00:38.139 --> 00:38.544
Samsung?

00:38.783 --> 00:39.797
That's a Samsung.

00:39.973 --> 00:40.224
Yeah.

00:40.575 --> 00:41.737
I could never get a Samsung.

00:42.447 --> 00:43.141
I'm creative.

00:43.637 --> 00:44.680
Dude, you're a barista.

00:45.226 --> 00:46.896
Why don't you guys just get 4G phones?

00:47.018 --> 00:48.385
Why don't you just get 4G phones?

00:48.731 --> 00:49.848
Yeah, it's a Galaxy SII.

00:50.648 --> 00:51.994
This phone is amazing.

00:56.476 --> 00:57.337
The Galaxy SII...

00:58.027 --> 00:58.583
...from Samsung.
