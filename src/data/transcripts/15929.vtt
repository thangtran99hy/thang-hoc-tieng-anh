I recently spoke at the Financial Bloggers Conference in Chicago.

00:04.117 --> 00:08.395
Almost every person you see here has a website offering money advice.

00:08.531 --> 00:12.726
With literally hundreds of the nation's best bloggers all gathered in one place, I thought,...

00:12.949 --> 00:15.257
..."What a great opportunity to catch up with a few..."

00:15.629 --> 00:18.094
"...ask them for their single best savings tip."

00:18.381 --> 00:19.062
Here's what they said.

00:19.203 --> 00:22.696
My favorite frugal tip is to put an obstacle between you and your payment method.

00:23.110 --> 00:27.295
So, some people will freeze their credit card in a block of ice.

00:27.470 --> 00:30.402
But, if you have to stop and consider and go,...

00:31.155 --> 00:34.120
..."Do I wanna melt that block of ice to buy this thing?"

00:35.367 --> 00:35.805
No.

00:36.008 --> 00:39.263
The single best savings tip is to cook your meals at home.

00:39.493 --> 00:42.437
I cook my meals at home six to seven days a week.

00:42.878 --> 00:46.687
I spent ten thousand dollars a year on my grocery bill last year.

00:47.140 --> 00:51.639
If I would have eaten those meals out, two to three times more expensive, so you do the math.

00:51.725 --> 00:54.788
For me, I actually stopped spending for like a month straight.

00:55.086 --> 00:58.071
Like, I literally did not spend anything except for utilities or credit card.

00:58.165 --> 00:59.319
Like, whatever my bills were, I did.

00:59.610 --> 01:03.029
I didn't go into any stores. I didn't even go to Starbucks, which I love,...

01:03.241 --> 01:05.889
...for one month to see if I can do it as a challenge.

01:06.053 --> 01:09.451
Once I did it, I saved like, four hundred dollars and I realized,...

01:10.632 --> 01:12.792
..."Okay, this is awesome because I didn't miss it."

01:13.083 --> 01:14.941
So many things that people didn't have a hundred years ago.

01:15.027 --> 01:16.795
I mean we all have heat inside of our houses.

01:16.897 --> 01:18.260
We don't have to go out to an outhouse.

01:18.342 --> 01:22.591
It's like things are pretty good now but, yet everybody wants to complain about how bad it is.

01:22.681 --> 01:26.683
So I would just say, you know, accept what you have and just enjoy it.

01:26.757 --> 01:28.807
And that really takes care of a lot of things.
