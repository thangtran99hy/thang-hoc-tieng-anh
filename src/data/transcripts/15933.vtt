00:37.041 --> 00:37.743
Would you say that again?

00:40.782 --> 00:41.283
The sun?

00:44.881 --> 00:48.434
There are over 7,000 languages spoken in the world...

00:49.424 --> 00:54.385
...and unfortunately, at least half of those languages are in danger of extinction.

00:58.973 --> 01:04.265
Scientists estimate that a human language disappears about every two weeks.

01:04.662 --> 01:07.252
And in Australia there are at least a hundred languages...

01:07.386 --> 01:09.963
...that are hanging on the very brink of extinction.

01:10.315 --> 01:13.785
You might wonder why we should care if an obscure Australian language...

01:13.883 --> 01:16.655
...that only has three speakers goes extinct.

01:16.852 --> 01:18.194
Why does that affect us?

01:18.468 --> 01:20.987
The knowledge that those people possess is unique.

01:21.244 --> 01:24.301
They've been here long before humans populated Europe.

01:25.017 --> 01:27.725
They have intricate knowledge of plants and animals...

01:27.807 --> 01:29.981
...that may not even be known to science at all.

01:30.472 --> 01:32.804
Most of this knowledge has never been written down anywhere.

01:32.899 --> 01:36.285
You can't find it in a book or in an encyclopedia or a database.

01:36.363 --> 01:37.848
It's only in people's heads.

01:38.317 --> 01:41.385
If that knowledge evaporates, then we've all lost something.

01:41.478 --> 01:44.511
We're all impoverished by the death of a single language.

01:45.163 --> 01:49.795
As a linguist and as a scientist, I feel a real sense of urgency.

01:50.462 --> 01:54.719
People travel around the world to see things that they think are ancient.

01:54.983 --> 01:59.438
The ancient in Australia is not in the seeing, it's not buildings or monuments.

01:59.510 --> 02:02.525
It's in the hearing: to hear the wisdom...

02:02.709 --> 02:06.514
...from the mouths of the last speakers of these nearly extinct languages.

02:08.413 --> 02:11.545
The transmission of knowledge has been disrupted.
