With iCloud, when you buy a song on one device,...

00:11.028 --> 00:13.165
...it instantly downloads to all your others.

00:18.889 --> 00:19.776
Take a picture here,...

00:21.815 --> 00:22.716
... and it shows up there.

00:26.968 --> 00:28.517
Start a project in one place,...

00:30.685 --> 00:32.571
...and pick up right where you left off in another.

00:38.307 --> 00:39.253
Capture the moment here,...

00:44.200 --> 00:45.479
...and it's waiting for you there.

00:50.514 --> 00:51.547
Make a change on this,...

00:53.927 --> 00:54.962
..and it updates on that.

00:59.045 --> 01:02.764
And with iCloud, it all works automatically and wirelessly.

01:05.245 --> 01:06.971
So, you always have the things you want...

01:08.325 --> 01:09.710
...exactly where you want them.
