ï»¿Hi, my name is Jason Cornwell and I'm a User Experience Designer on Gmail.

00:04.655 --> 00:06.837
We've been hard at work to update Gmail with a new look...

00:07.034 --> 00:09.428
...and I'm excited to share with you some of the biggest improvements.

00:10.113 --> 00:13.261
To start, we've completely redesigned the look and feel of Gmail...

00:13.555 --> 00:16.249
...to make it as clean, simple and intuitive as possible.

00:17.029 --> 00:20.934
In addition, the new Gmail automatically adapts to fit nicely in any size window.

00:23.405 --> 00:26.733
If you prefer a specific display density, you can easily set that as well.

00:30.552 --> 00:32.905
Some people use a lot of labels, others chat a lot.

00:33.433 --> 00:36.581
You can now adjust the size of the label and chat areas to meet your needs.

00:37.161 --> 00:39.366
Even if you do nothing, Gmail adapts to you.

00:40.943 --> 00:43.221
The new look allows themes to really shine.

00:43.657 --> 00:46.431
We've updated many of them with new high-resolution imagery.

00:47.439 --> 00:50.894
You may want to take a moment to check out one of the many new high-definition themes.

00:52.411 --> 00:55.513
Conversations in Gmail have been redesigned to improve readability...

00:55.955 --> 00:57.485
...and to feel more like a real conversation.

00:58.227 --> 01:01.138
We've also added profile pictures so that you can see who said what.

01:02.589 --> 01:04.183
Searching is at the heart of Gmail.

01:05.296 --> 01:09.395
The new search box makes it easy to customize your search and find exactly what you're looking for.

01:11.753 --> 01:14.055
You can also create a filter right from the search box.

01:17.287 --> 01:19.420
We're excited to finally share the new Gmail with you...

01:19.856 --> 01:22.017
...and hope you'll enjoy the new design as much as we do.
