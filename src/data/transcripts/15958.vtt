00:02.626 --> 00:06.532
Soldiers, sailors and airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Force.

00:07.763 --> 00:10.316
You are about to embark upon a "Great Crusade"...

00:10.971 --> 00:13.062
...toward which we have striven these many months.

00:13.893 --> 00:15.441
The eyes of the world are upon you.

00:16.502 --> 00:20.534
The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you.

00:21.621 --> 00:25.630
In company with our brave allies and brothers in arms on other fronts,...

00:26.151 --> 00:28.894
...you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine,...

00:29.497 --> 00:32.665
...the elimination of Nazi tyranny over the oppressed peoples of Europe,...

00:33.375 --> 00:35.796
...and security for ourselves in a free world.

00:36.985 --> 00:38.767
Your task will not be an easy one.

00:39.497 --> 00:42.723
Your enemy is well-trained, well-equipped and battle-hardened.

00:43.349 --> 00:44.505
He will fight savagely.

00:45.559 --> 00:47.657
But this is the year 1944.

00:48.671 --> 00:52.651
Much has happened since the Nazi triumphs of 1940-41.

00:53.522 --> 00:57.084
The United Nations have inflicted upon the Germans great defeats,...

00:57.691 --> 00:59.546
... in open battle, man-to-man.

01:00.549 --> 01:04.463
Our air offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air...

01:04.667 --> 01:06.998
...and their capacity to wage war on the ground.

01:08.036 --> 01:13.398
Our home fronts have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war,...

01:14.314 --> 01:17.973
...and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men.

01:18.951 --> 01:20.049
The tide has turned.

01:20.779 --> 01:23.777
The free men of the world are marching together to victory.

01:24.907 --> 01:28.939
I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty and skill in battle.

01:29.860 --> 01:32.751
We will accept nothing less than full victory.

01:33.779 --> 01:34.109
Good luck!

01:34.906 --> 01:40.374
And let us all beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking.
