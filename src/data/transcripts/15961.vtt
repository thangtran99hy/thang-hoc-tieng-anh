00:11.617 --> 00:12.125
Dad?

00:12.249 --> 00:12.803
Yes, son?

00:12.940 --> 00:16.361
This human idea of Christmas shopping does my head in.

00:16.467 --> 00:17.104
I know, son.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.714
It all feels a bit alien, doesn't it, running around panicked?

00:19.854 --> 00:23.147
I thought it was the season to be jolly, but maybe not.

00:23.239 --> 00:26.008
The big man in red seems happy enough.

00:26.315 --> 00:28.489
Everyone else seems terribly stressy, though.

00:28.567 --> 00:31.712
I don't understand why they don't just reserve their presents online with Argos.

00:31.801 --> 00:36.082
As a conundrum, it's up there with Justin Bieber and eggnog.

00:36.317 --> 00:37.781
Eggnog.

00:37.904 --> 00:39.353
Bieber.

00:42.665 --> 00:45.035
To guarantee a great Christmas, Argos it.

00:45.193 --> 00:48.547
Just check and reserve online, and pick up all your presents that same day...

00:48.685 --> 00:50.506
...from over 750 stores.

00:50.583 --> 00:52.800
We believe there's a better way to shop online.

00:52.973 --> 00:53.584
Argos it.

00:54.109 --> 00:56.363
We're walking in the air.

00:56.625 --> 00:59.635
We're walking in the air.
