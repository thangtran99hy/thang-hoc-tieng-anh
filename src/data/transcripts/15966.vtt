Bill Emerson, the CEO of Quicken Loans, is a strong believer in an "open door" policy,...

00:07.546 --> 00:11.116
...which means his door is always open to any of his staff.

00:11.882 --> 00:18.153
He is also against hierarchical notions like boss and worker and prefers the title "team leaders".

00:19.005 --> 00:26.067
Effective communication is a top priority in his company, and in this way, he personalizes communication.

00:26.731 --> 00:31.951
He arranges weekly face-to-face meetings with his staff where questions can be asked...

00:32.101 --> 00:38.790
...and any concerns and opinions are expressed because the daily personal interactions are most important.

00:39.511 --> 00:42.771
Leaders do not spend their days locked up in their offices...

00:43.161 --> 00:46.251
...but spend a large part of the day on the "shop floor"...

00:46.589 --> 00:49.858
...and are in touch with team members, working alongside them.

00:50.736 --> 00:55.298
In this way, leaders are more reachable and thus help to improve morale.

00:56.007 --> 00:59.755
The staff comment that they enjoy the general informality.

01:00.456 --> 01:05.651
They receive important business messages and understand the direction the company is headed.

01:06.369 --> 01:10.065
They also don't feel awkward or afraid to ask about anything.
