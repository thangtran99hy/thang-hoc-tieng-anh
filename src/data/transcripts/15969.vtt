A business card is one of the most powerful but often ignored tools when you are marketing yourself.

00:08.345 --> 00:10.716
They are inexpensive, yet indispensable.

00:11.589 --> 00:15.567
They are like mini resumes that tell about you and what you are selling.

00:16.527 --> 00:20.753
To include a descriptive catchphrase or tagline can work wonders.

00:21.803 --> 00:26.729
What is interesting is that people are more likely to keep a business card with a photo on it.

00:27.575 --> 00:29.365
These cards get attention!

00:30.165 --> 00:35.510
It could be a photo of yourself or of something related to your area of expertise.

00:36.267 --> 00:40.267
However, other people say that you should keep a business card simple.

00:41.131 --> 00:45.523
A white background, simple font and no elaborate colors work best.

00:46.449 --> 00:49.647
You should also make sure that your text and margins line up.

00:50.585 --> 00:54.607
An uneven text looks messy and tells a lot about the person.

00:55.673 --> 01:00.055
In any case, it's essential that you get your cards professionally done.
