When you think that an employee spends more time at work than with his family,...

00:06.712 --> 00:11.112
...you realize that building good relationships is absolutely necessary.

00:11.922 --> 00:17.581
Getting along with your co-workers might seem like a huge effort, but the benefits can be great.

00:18.407 --> 00:19.456
Here are some basics.

00:20.151 --> 00:25.745
First, a simple greeting can be most effective, and being cheerful helps you and others.

00:26.565 --> 00:31.564
It is best not to get involved in office politics or to associate with cliques.

00:32.338 --> 00:35.688
It will likely be counterproductive and can backfire on you.

00:36.551 --> 00:40.378
Second, if you work on a project, make sure you do your part.

00:40.909 --> 00:43.327
Never let others do the bulk of your work.

00:44.015 --> 00:51.101
Third, praising and complimenting a co-worker for a good idea or a job well done will go a long way.

00:51.891 --> 00:56.146
You should give constructive criticism at a proper time and in private,...

00:56.559 --> 01:00.907
...rather than mentioning mistakes and shortcomings in front of the boss or the team.

01:01.687 --> 01:05.210
Lastly, getting involved in gossip is a waste of time.

01:05.829 --> 01:08.937
Avoid talking to a colleague about another co-worker.

01:09.487 --> 01:13.493
It's best to change the subject, because it's not really your business.
