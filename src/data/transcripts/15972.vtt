There is no point in false modesty here...

00:04.421 --> 00:05.629
...beat your own drum!

00:06.272 --> 00:08.093
Take credit for your accomplishments,...

00:08.327 --> 00:12.034
...ensure that the bosses know about it and learn to accept praise.

00:12.831 --> 00:17.873
Be aware of how you act and what you say because positive interaction attracts people.

00:18.749 --> 00:23.777
Project an image that will put you at the top of the list when the next promotion comes up.

00:24.874 --> 00:27.269
Although you don't have to be everyone's friend,...

00:27.678 --> 00:32.453
...be sure to establish trusting relationships because they will impact your future.

00:33.235 --> 00:36.697
Don't spend too much time at the office when no one sees you there.

00:37.411 --> 00:42.944
Get out and attend after-hours meetings, seminars and conferences where you can network.

00:43.815 --> 00:50.521
Successful leaders take a proactive approach and don't rely on their next in line for answers to problems.

00:51.305 --> 00:54.070
You need to understand the imperatives of projects,...

00:54.519 --> 00:57.615
...concentrate on goals, not on single activities,...

00:58.207 --> 01:02.218
...make decisions and not get stressed about every little ambiguity.

01:03.013 --> 01:07.591
Don't sympathize with negative thinking people, but learn from their failures.
