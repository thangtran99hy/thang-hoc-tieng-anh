Have you ever watched a presentation of iPhone emperor Steve Jobs?

00:06.645 --> 00:10.712
Many people admit that his presentations are concise and powerful.

00:11.486 --> 00:17.214
He is a good example of someone who shows us how to make an impressive presentation to audiences.

00:17.885 --> 00:19.826
So, how can we imitate him?

00:20.735 --> 00:24.433
"Practice makes perfect" is a cliche but ever so true.

00:25.241 --> 00:29.459
Yet, how do you exactly practice and prepare for a presentation?

00:30.287 --> 00:34.387
Against common advice, it is best not to practice in front of a mirror...

00:34.703 --> 00:37.853
...as it will distract you and make you more self-conscious.

00:38.599 --> 00:43.420
Use an area that resembles the actual location, and videotape your attempts.

00:44.115 --> 00:45.844
Use the camera as the audience!

00:46.511 --> 00:50.851
You don't have to worry about making mistakes during the mock presentation.

00:51.638 --> 00:54.750
Because we are often not the best judges of our own work,...

00:55.172 --> 01:00.414
...show the delivery to family, friends or even a professional and get some feedback.

01:00.979 --> 01:04.621
Moreover, focus on areas where you might stumble over words.

01:05.054 --> 01:09.541
Some sentences look great on paper but can in practice be tongue twisters...

01:09.817 --> 01:11.857
...and some jokes may not hit the mark.
