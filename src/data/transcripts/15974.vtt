00:01.773 --> 00:06.485
The idea behind professional development is that people have unused potential,...

00:07.540 --> 00:12.198
...and that you need not limit yourself with what you have if you want to get more out of life.

00:13.024 --> 00:16.711
It's a process of constantly advancing and perfecting yourself...

00:17.550 --> 00:20.071
...and your qualities as a professional or individual.

00:20.653 --> 00:24.547
Professional development and positive thinking are closely associated.

00:25.550 --> 00:28.293
If you believe you can improve, then it's possible.

00:29.048 --> 00:32.329
Looking at things in a positive way will give you more energy...

00:32.671 --> 00:37.781
...and the strength to put more effort into everything because you are aiming at an end goal.

00:38.519 --> 00:41.865
And setting realistic and achievable goals is at the center.

00:42.509 --> 00:44.115
In order to know your progress,...

00:44.552 --> 00:47.961
...you must have a timetable and be able to measure your goals.

00:48.573 --> 00:52.357
This will give you a sense of achievement and reinforce your positive attitude.

00:53.029 --> 00:56.758
Setbacks from the past or negative input from friends and family...

00:57.520 --> 00:59.853
...can be a hindrance that you need to overcome.

01:00.810 --> 01:04.298
Making changes and adhering to them are also not easy.

01:04.889 --> 01:07.317
However, you need to stick to your plans.
