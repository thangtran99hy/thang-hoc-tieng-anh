Traditionally, food and wine pairing,...

00:06.534 --> 00:09.830
...it used to be a lot of rules. You needed to drink white wine before red wines and...

00:10.191 --> 00:12.492
...you need to have light flavors before strong flavors.

00:12.910 --> 00:14.891
I think today, we can actually do what we want.

00:15.001 --> 00:17.961
Yeah, it's so much more dynamic today in pairing food and wine.

00:18.374 --> 00:20.719
Of course, the most important thing is the company.

00:20.781 --> 00:24.868
It's really important to adapt your choice of wine and food so we are there...

00:24.953 --> 00:26.758
...to actually to eat and drink and have a good time,...

00:26.894 --> 00:28.419
...not analyzing flavors.

00:32.945 --> 00:36.853
The rules used to be very much white wine with fish, red wine with meat.

00:37.248 --> 00:38.333
But there's so much we can adapt.

00:38.500 --> 00:43.129
For instance, if you wanna eat a nice fish dish and drink a powerful and rich red wine...

00:43.506 --> 00:46.067
...such as Brunello di Montalcino from 2006.

00:46.605 --> 00:51.578
You've pan-fried the fish, you've grilled the fish and with this we could make a nice risotto...

00:51.679 --> 00:54.001
...with some beautiful porcini mushrooms in it.

00:54.383 --> 00:58.953
And I think mushroom is a very wine friendly ingredient with mature wines.

00:59.249 --> 01:02.034
We add some mature Parmesan cheese with this one.

01:02.527 --> 01:07.109
And we make a red wine gray with some balsamic vinegar and some red wine...

01:07.451 --> 01:10.133
..and this would be a perfect red wine fish dish.

01:15.285 --> 01:18.165
In general, I think it's easier to match red wine with meat.

01:18.253 --> 01:20.475
If you have a perfectly grilled piece of meat,...

01:21.183 --> 01:23.887
...you can have a lighter style or a fuller style of wine.

01:24.171 --> 01:25.903
It's not so much about those fine nuances.

01:26.056 --> 01:30.438
However, I think the best matches are with white wines because white wines are more fine,...

01:30.877 --> 01:35.349
...more transparent and, depending on that slight level of residual sugar...

01:35.761 --> 01:39.651
...on the acidity, I think they can give you a fuller experience so that mean,...

01:40.053 --> 01:44.186
...imagine to make something based on scallops, prawns, white fish...

01:44.561 --> 01:47.123
...with some chili pepper, coriander, a bit Asian style,...

01:47.578 --> 01:51.030
...that we could do perfect with a well chilled Vermentino...

01:51.371 --> 01:58.020
...or a German Riesling and you will get that very pure and perfect match on your palate.

02:02.176 --> 02:06.027
Another fundamental thing is that the food and the wine should be on the same level.

02:06.434 --> 02:10.759
With a simple spaghetti with tomato, you drink a simple red wine from the region.

02:11.164 --> 02:15.680
But if you go and buy fresh turbot, fresh scallops, truffles, sweet breads,...

02:15.996 --> 02:19.515
...of course, the wine, they need to be on a slightly higher level. And if you eat...

02:19.850 --> 02:23.123
...that great dish with a simple wine, it won't be really good.

02:27.249 --> 02:32.261
Even though you could probably enjoy a more exclusive wine still with your simple spaghetti.
