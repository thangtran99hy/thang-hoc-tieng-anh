In this scene, you're talking on the phone.

00:03.548 --> 00:04.966
You're trying to make plans for the weekend.

00:05.485 --> 00:08.326
When you practice, stand back to back so you can't see each other.

00:08.805 --> 00:12.727
It's hard to hear so you can say things like, "I didn't hear you".

00:13.044 --> 00:13.815
"What did you say?"

00:14.849 --> 00:16.701
Okay, you're ready? Let's give it a try.

00:24.849 --> 00:25.273
Hello!

00:25.991 --> 00:27.357
Hi, Marco! It's Hannah.

00:28.224 --> 00:28.783
Hi, Hannah!

00:28.975 --> 00:30.180
Oh, What are you doing Friday night?

00:30.747 --> 00:33.501
Friday night? I always work Friday night.

00:34.608 --> 00:35.290
That's right.

00:36.044 --> 00:37.131
Well, what about Saturday?

00:37.623 --> 00:40.098
Saturday is fine. I never work on Saturday.

00:40.955 --> 00:42.002
Would you like to go to dinner?

00:42.382 --> 00:44.296
Dinner? That sounds good.

00:44.702 --> 00:45.385
Wonderful!
