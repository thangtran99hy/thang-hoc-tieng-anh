Customers are more likely to spread good word of mouth about your company and come back themselves...

00:05.010 --> 00:06.582
...when they feel welcomed and valued,...

00:06.942 --> 00:09.319
...and when they sense that you identify with their needs.

00:09.681 --> 00:14.377
So, if your staff's phone skills and manners aren't actively encouraging repeat visits,...

00:14.475 --> 00:16.489
...adopt these five simple rules.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.354
Smile when you answer the phone.

00:18.595 --> 00:21.017
Callers will hear the friendliness in your voice.

00:21.719 --> 00:23.293
Speak slowly and clearly.

00:23.603 --> 00:25.933
Don't make callers ask you to repeat yourself.

00:26.521 --> 00:28.074
Refer to callers by name.

00:28.339 --> 00:30.221
Most people like to hear the sound of their own name...

00:30.343 --> 00:33.095
...and hearing you say it tells them they're important to you.

00:33.321 --> 00:36.424
Be friendly but use courteous, respectful language.

00:36.733 --> 00:40.541
You'll never know how callers may be judging you and by extension, your company.

00:41.014 --> 00:43.733
And apply the golden rule to every caller.

00:44.057 --> 00:47.478
Treat them the same way you'd like to be treated as a paying customer.

00:47.779 --> 00:51.062
These rules may seem basic, but how many companies are living by them?

00:51.253 --> 00:54.290
And remember, successful companies are often built on the basics.

00:54.524 --> 00:57.278
Like a customer-centric attitude and the understanding that...

00:57.365 --> 01:01.638
...every phone call is a chance to build customer share and create brand evangelists.
