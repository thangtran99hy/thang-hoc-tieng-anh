00:01.314 --> 00:03.579
Because we need to make the most of our day,...

00:03.949 --> 00:06.876
...here are some ideas to effectively manage your time.

00:07.823 --> 00:12.833
People who worry or procrastinate are wasting time because both involve a lot of thinking.

00:13.695 --> 00:17.608
Rather than spend time thinking about whether or not you should do something,...

00:18.059 --> 00:23.829
...worrying about the best way of doing it, take the "just do it"  approach and be done with it.

00:24.698 --> 00:27.423
Having a routine is another good way of saving time.

00:28.102 --> 00:32.689
Plan your day, because if you know what and how you are going to do something,...

00:33.017 --> 00:34.353
...it saves a lot of time.

00:35.334 --> 00:38.598
An everyday routine is a fabulous timesaving tool.

00:39.369 --> 00:40.624
If you already have one,...

00:40.967 --> 00:44.708
...try to adjust or update it to gain even more free time.

00:45.563 --> 00:49.651
You could add two hours to your day if you get up an hour earlier...

00:49.933 --> 00:51.489
...and go to bed an hour later.

00:52.308 --> 00:58.461
It is absolutely amazing what you can achieve in just an hour when you really focus on a task.
