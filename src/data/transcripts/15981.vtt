Time is important and keeping a planner is a good tool to keep track of things.

00:06.672 --> 00:08.048
Whenever you plan something,...

00:08.379 --> 00:14.345
...make sure you allow some extra time for each item by adding about 25% more time.

00:15.059 --> 00:20.457
This additional time comes in handy and may help you not to be late for another appointment.

00:21.353 --> 00:24.445
Note down those tasks that you have delegated to others.

00:25.151 --> 00:31.543
It would also be a good idea to include an address book to save time looking for this information elsewhere.

00:32.472 --> 00:36.449
Schedule some relaxation time and include personal stuff too,...

00:36.799 --> 00:41.914
...because having all information in your planner will show you how much spare time you have.

00:42.518 --> 00:45.076
Be diligent about keeping your schedule updated.

00:45.803 --> 00:47.427
The Outlook digital calendar...

00:47.737 --> 00:52.749
...and some mobile phones that you can synchronize with your computer can be excellent gadgets.

00:53.486 --> 00:56.473
The iPhone also has a great number of applications...

00:56.819 --> 01:00.085
...that can actually help you manage your day and week effectively.
