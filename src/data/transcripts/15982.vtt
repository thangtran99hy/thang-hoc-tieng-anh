The integration of different races in America has produced a mixture of dialects,...

00:05.545 --> 00:07.684
...making second language learning a necessity.

00:08.087 --> 00:09.375
So why not start early?

00:09.725 --> 00:13.507
Statistics confirm that early childhood education in bilingualism...

00:13.585 --> 00:16.465
...is crucial in a world that is so diverse and ever-changing.

00:17.043 --> 00:20.334
This early teaching of verbal communication and cultural knowledge...

00:20.689 --> 00:23.941
...can create a world of opportunity for both you and your child.

00:24.539 --> 00:29.017
Studies show that children who immerse themselves in language learning at an early age...

00:29.380 --> 00:32.867
...have an advantage beyond job opportunities and foreign borders.

00:34.042 --> 00:38.232
Hi and welcome to this edition of Carpe Diem. I'm your host Cristina Pinzon.

00:38.669 --> 00:42.259
Today, we will discuss the benefits of children learning a second language.

00:42.596 --> 00:45.517
Whether it's Spanish, Chinese, Dutch or Arabic,...

00:45.843 --> 00:49.215
...learning a second language fosters a child's progress in reading,...

00:49.562 --> 00:51.952
...concept formation and cognitive development,...

00:52.351 --> 00:55.203
...as well as instilling a greater cultural sense of understanding...

00:55.341 --> 00:56.662
...for people of foreign countries.

00:57.265 --> 01:01.403
Early childhood education in bilingualism is growing by leaps and bounds.

01:01.750 --> 01:03.335
The family you are about to meet...

01:03.436 --> 01:06.897
...decided to invest in a diverse education for their two daughters.

01:07.320 --> 01:10.827
Suzanne Rosenthal took the initiative of exposing her children...

01:11.090 --> 01:14.989
...to a rich linguistic environment at a local bilingual school in Scotch Plains.

01:15.306 --> 01:16.008
Let's take a look.

01:17.949 --> 01:20.851
With the global demographic changes that are emerging,...

01:21.032 --> 01:23.027
...more people are acknowledging the spread...

01:23.533 --> 01:27.353
...by immersing themselves and their children in language learning programs.

01:28.267 --> 01:32.766
The advantage of having free education is a huge blessing to some parents,...

01:33.299 --> 01:37.467
...especially when it comes to fulfilling their kids with a rich education.

01:42.131 --> 01:47.302
Through cultural music, dynamic group activities, storytelling,...

01:47.811 --> 01:49.850
...children are able to express themselves...

01:50.144 --> 01:53.411
...in a world where language and cultural barriers are nonexistent.

01:54.617 --> 01:56.926
Does a universal language really exist?

01:57.478 --> 02:01.550
Ask five-year-old Meredith Rosenthal and she'll give you her answer.

02:02.497 --> 02:07.362
I really liked that time when I said the train was going to the moon...

02:07.653 --> 02:10.385
...because you can speak any language on the moon.

02:11.013 --> 02:14.841
I don't think any girls have been on "la luna".

02:16.068 --> 02:18.214
Amanda, at the ripe age of three,...

02:18.411 --> 02:23.044
...is living proof as she teaches us how to say her numbers in Spanish.

02:25.135 --> 02:29.402
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco!

02:36.695 --> 02:39.306
To Suzanne, Spanish, in particular,...

02:39.535 --> 02:43.253
...made it very easy in determining the language and cultures...

02:43.457 --> 02:45.495
...she would expose her two daughters to.

02:46.889 --> 02:52.753
America is becoming much more of a country that has Spanish as a second language.

02:53.131 --> 02:59.163
And I think whatever future they've got, in terms of their careers, in terms of their lifestyle,...

02:59.499 --> 03:03.010
...it'll be great for them to know the language; I think it will be good for them to understand.

03:05.769 --> 03:08.703
I studied Spanish in high school and again in college.

03:09.819 --> 03:13.093
I comprehend a lot of Spanish but I never really learned to speak it very well...

03:13.181 --> 03:15.301
...because I think I didn't pick it up until I was a teenager.

03:15.410 --> 03:18.269
So for my children, I wanted them to learn when they were young...

03:18.386 --> 03:23.615
...so that they would really be able to speak and be able to have the right accent...

03:23.694 --> 03:25.466
...and the right pronunciation of Spanish.
