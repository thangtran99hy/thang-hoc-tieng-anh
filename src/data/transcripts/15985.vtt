President Clinton, Mr. Speaker, distinguished members of the Senate and the House, ladies and gentlemen.

00:33.445 --> 00:39.093
There's one regret I've had throughout my life,...

00:42.524 --> 00:48.938
...that I never became the heavyweight boxing champion of the world.

01:09.253 --> 01:17.375
I would like my friend, Evander Holyfield, to know that today...

01:18.412 --> 01:21.138
...I feel like the heavyweight boxing champion of the world.

01:34.640 --> 01:45.539
It has been my great privilege to serve a people whose bondage to an inhuman system...

01:47.359 --> 01:54.024
...evoked the solidarity of all those who love freedom and justice.

01:56.755 --> 02:03.904
A people whose triumph over the divisions of racist doctrine has given new life...

02:05.153 --> 02:11.011
...to humanity's hope for a world without hatred and discrimination.

02:14.182 --> 02:20.501
I am conscious that in bestowing the Congressional Gold Medal upon me,...

02:22.233 --> 02:30.296
...you are evoking these bonds between our nation and paying tribute...

02:31.463 --> 02:41.217
...to the whole South African nation for its achievement in realizing our shared ideal.

02:51.773 --> 03:03.238
It is in that spirit that I humbly accept the award, aware at the same time of the great honor...

03:04.231 --> 03:10.448
...you do me by using me as the vehicle of a unique distinction...

03:11.531 --> 03:17.603
...conferred by this hallowed institution of American democracy.

03:20.015 --> 03:25.485
As one who has dedicated his life to the pursuit of unity,...

03:27.015 --> 03:34.097
...I am moved by the consensus in your nation's regard for the achievements of my people.

03:36.201 --> 03:43.220
And I feel great pride in the fact that to the few citizens of other countries...

03:43.999 --> 03:51.152
...who have received this high honor, the name of an African is now added.
