Cain was the first man ever to strike down another.

00:12.503 --> 00:15.861
And when the Lord came to him and said, "What've you done?",...

00:17.345 --> 00:19.209
...Cain could not hide his crime...

00:20.575 --> 00:25.748
...for the voice of his brother's blood cried out from the very ground.

00:35.428 --> 00:37.011
The world has been your battlefield.

00:38.808 --> 00:39.794
Everywhere you go,...

00:41.540 --> 00:43.237
...the blood of brothers and sons...

00:45.485 --> 00:46.739
...screams out against you.

01:07.755 --> 01:09.631
Perhaps you cannot yet hear it...

01:14.941 --> 01:16.409
...because the soil is not your own.

01:20.873 --> 01:21.448
But you will.

01:41.797 --> 01:42.428
You will.
