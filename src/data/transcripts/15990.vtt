It's true what they say, it's better to give than to receive.

00:04.605 --> 00:07.511
This time of the year, I get really generous.

00:08.617 --> 00:12.666
On the 12th day of Christmas, mayhem gave to me...

00:13.064 --> 00:14.336
12 trees are rolling!

00:14.413 --> 00:15.739
11 puppies eating!

00:15.842 --> 00:17.149
Ten pipes are bursting!

00:17.269 --> 00:18.543
Nine ladies jogging!

00:18.634 --> 00:19.805
Eight flags are flying!

00:19.893 --> 00:21.075
Seven dishes falling!

00:21.172 --> 00:22.388
Six teens are texting!

00:22.463 --> 00:25.225
Five snowy roofs!

00:26.215 --> 00:27.483
Four icy roads!

00:27.584 --> 00:28.736
Three frozen deer!

00:28.877 --> 00:30.135
Two turtledoves!

00:30.245 --> 00:33.687
And this shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky tree.

00:35.273 --> 00:36.493
The holidays of mayhem.

00:37.724 --> 00:38.875
Are you in good hands?
