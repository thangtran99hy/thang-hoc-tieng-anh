00:01.919 --> 00:05.147
When your schedule seems endlessly long, simplify it.

00:05.827 --> 00:12.113
Concentrate on the really important things and delegate less important tasks if someone else can do them.

00:12.971 --> 00:15.524
This may even halve your "to do list."

00:16.437 --> 00:18.335
Set a limit on your working hours.

00:19.055 --> 00:22.030
If you work more than nine hours, set a nine-hour limit.

00:22.777 --> 00:27.494
Likewise, if you work eight hours, mentally try to have a six-hour limit.

00:28.375 --> 00:33.231
Do the most important duties first, and the rest of the day will seem a lot easier,...

00:33.362 --> 00:35.999
...rather than doing bits and pieces throughout the day.

00:36.891 --> 00:44.463
It saves tons of time if you do all your emails in one go, do the paperwork and make all phone calls together.

00:45.164 --> 00:50.550
Avoid unimportant meetings and, equally, avoid long conversations that are unproductive.

00:51.273 --> 00:54.189
While interaction with co-workers is important,...

00:54.553 --> 00:59.427
...you could be spending this time getting your tasks done and spending time with your family.

01:00.237 --> 01:01.785
Finally, learn to say "No."

01:02.520 --> 01:05.458
You may not want to disappoint someone asking for help,...

01:06.078 --> 01:10.805
...but by agreeing to a task, you may have bitten off more than you can chew.
