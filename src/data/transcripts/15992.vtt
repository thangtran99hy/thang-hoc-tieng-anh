To spend your time efficiently, you need to break your goals down into small chunks.

00:07.276 --> 00:13.191
Firstly, you ought to break down your life into the different roles you play as a worker or manager,...

00:13.649 --> 00:17.789
...member of an organization, blogger, husband or wife, etc.

00:18.591 --> 00:21.746
You then set long-term goals for each of these roles.

00:22.471 --> 00:23.893
This will help balance your life.

00:24.622 --> 00:28.973
Each week, you should be working in small parts towards your long-term aims.

00:29.882 --> 00:34.441
Because you have unavoidable events every week, you should use a weekly planner.

00:35.299 --> 00:37.309
Leave some space for the unexpected.

00:38.007 --> 00:43.441
Schedule the most essential items for your goal list into the blank spaces in your day planner.

00:44.226 --> 00:48.066
Before the end of each day, take some time with your weekly goal sheet...

00:48.460 --> 00:51.519
...and include whatever is possible in the next day's plan.

00:52.483 --> 00:55.608
Also, include things like phone calls and emails.

00:56.331 --> 01:00.143
In this way, the daily plans will match up with your weekly goals.

01:00.967 --> 01:06.495
By setting weekly goals, organizing daily tasks and working hard, you will get there.
