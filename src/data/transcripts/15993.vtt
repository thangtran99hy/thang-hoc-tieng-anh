00:01.773 --> 00:05.455
In order to analyze how you use your time, create a time log.

00:06.190 --> 00:10.081
A good way would be to divide the day into 15-minute slots.

00:10.852 --> 00:17.591
Note tasks that you do a lot, like writing, emailing, traveling, etc., across the top of the page.

00:18.569 --> 00:22.159
Underneath could be a row where you write down what you actually did.

00:23.020 --> 00:28.330
Three columns entitled "enjoyment," "productivity" and "energy" could be below that.

00:29.248 --> 00:33.129
In the first column, jot down activities that you liked or disliked.

00:33.863 --> 00:38.557
Under "productivity," mark "high" or "low," and the same under the energy column.

00:39.039 --> 00:46.570
Why? Because you can be highly energetic, yet still be very low in productivity, doing something unnecessary.

00:47.543 --> 00:51.491
Alternatively, you could have low energy but be productive.

00:52.261 --> 00:54.963
Do the logs only for a few consecutive days.

00:55.559 --> 00:57.819
Then, consider the following five questions:...

00:58.413 --> 00:59.306
...Do you need to do it?

01:00.049 --> 01:01.596
Can the frequency be changed?

01:02.299 --> 01:03.721
Can the quality be changed?

01:04.288 --> 01:05.557
Can the method be changed?

01:06.257 --> 01:08.657
Can you delegate part or the whole task?
