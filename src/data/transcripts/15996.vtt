00:01.507 --> 00:04.947
First and foremost, be clear about your absolute minimum.

00:05.519 --> 00:09.102
Research the pay scale of the company and industry average pay.

00:09.482 --> 00:13.952
Never mention any pay expectations on application forms or cover letters.

00:14.447 --> 00:16.831
If your job is in high demand, refer to it.

00:17.265 --> 00:22.299
It is also fine to say that you have other interviews, but don't act too self-assured.

00:22.785 --> 00:24.983
Don't be the one to bring up a salary figure.

00:25.528 --> 00:30.521
If it's unavoidable, mention your pay range, but say that this is up to negotiation.

00:30.943 --> 00:33.985
Talk about your previous achievements in higher productivity,...

00:34.351 --> 00:37.559
...cost savings and your general benefit to the last company.

00:38.071 --> 00:39.956
This can improve the salary offer.

00:40.590 --> 00:45.833
Once a salary figure is on the table, indicate that you are considering it, but keep quiet.

00:46.637 --> 00:48.923
The figure could go up in that short time span.

00:49.596 --> 00:52.471
Though money is important, think about the whole package.

00:53.150 --> 00:58.028
Ask about the frequency of pay increases, perks and additional bonuses.

00:58.770 --> 01:02.495
In any case, be well prepared and apply a little psychology...

01:02.833 --> 01:05.289
...and your negotiation skills to get the best offer.
