From birth, we have learned to get what we want by lying, making people feel guilty,...

00:06.717 --> 00:11.037
...asking again and again and thus wearing the other person down, and so on.

00:11.800 --> 00:16.258
Yet, the best way to get something from people is to tell them exactly why.

00:16.943 --> 00:23.058
To start with, you have to find reasons why your request is in the other person's best interest.

00:23.625 --> 00:26.107
If it isn't, then you shouldn't really ask.

00:26.899 --> 00:30.501
Being honest will make you feel happier getting what you want.

00:31.316 --> 00:36.935
It also works better in the long term, because people respect honesty and will learn to trust you.

00:37.626 --> 00:41.236
Your words will have more value and people will listen to you.

00:42.041 --> 00:46.379
There is no need to be persuasive, charming or clever to be effective.

00:47.112 --> 00:49.831
The important thing is that you should practice in your head.

00:50.372 --> 00:52.225
Imagine something you want to gain,...

00:52.493 --> 00:56.487
...and think of reasons why it would be in the other person's best interest.

00:57.063 --> 00:58.379
And imagine telling them.

00:58.780 --> 01:01.773
Make it a habit and you will always benefit from it.
