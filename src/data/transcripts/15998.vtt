We often think of complaining as negative, but it can lead to improvements when done effectively.

00:08.363 --> 00:12.983
Being hostile, self-pitying and offering no solutions are the wrong way.

00:13.673 --> 00:18.159
A balanced approach is to be reasonable, realistic and respectful.

00:19.106 --> 00:23.537
In fact, effective complaining entails knowledge, attitude and skills.

00:24.247 --> 00:25.237
Knowledge is power.

00:25.837 --> 00:32.010
Know the facts and your rights, know where to complain and know what you want and who can support you.

00:32.695 --> 00:33.998
Attitude is everything.

00:34.632 --> 00:38.147
Frustration, resentment and sadness will work against you.

00:38.683 --> 00:44.369
Be flexible, empathetic, rational, nonjudgmental and solution oriented.

00:45.212 --> 00:49.859
You will need communication, organizational and negotiating skills.

00:50.643 --> 00:56.902
You will need to be able to ask questions, summarize and present problems clearly and be a good listener.

00:57.694 --> 01:00.119
You need to keep detailed records and evidence.

01:00.767 --> 01:04.239
Lastly, you need to be able to discern what is important,...

01:04.871 --> 01:07.110
...put yourself into the other person's shoes...

01:07.555 --> 01:10.467
...and be clear about compromises you are willing to make.
