We spend most of our life working.

00:04.665 --> 00:09.597
Therefore, it would be important that we learn how to deal with our daily problems at work...

00:09.929 --> 00:11.485
...as well as in our private lives.

00:12.234 --> 00:17.809
The author of the 2006 bestseller The Secret says that her new book The Power...

00:18.108 --> 00:19.643
...will add a lot of new insights.

00:20.647 --> 00:23.562
Byrne views life as either positive or negative.

00:24.195 --> 00:28.833
She explains how our attitude and way of looking at things influence our reality...

00:29.435 --> 00:32.339
...and how one can make bad aspects seem a lot better.

00:33.050 --> 00:37.075
She writes, "No matter what negative situation you find yourself in,...

00:37.432 --> 00:41.103
...you can always find something to be grateful for, and as you do,...

00:41.513 --> 00:44.585
...you harness the force of love that eliminates negativity."

00:45.621 --> 00:49.775
This mental outlook can, of course, be transferred to our working life, too.

00:50.532 --> 00:52.803
When you spend most of your time at the workplace,...

00:53.250 --> 00:56.628
...having a general change of mind can change your work attitude.
