The Harvard Negotiating Project is a consortium of scholars from top U.S. universities.

00:07.431 --> 00:11.718
The members work to improve the theory and practice of conflict resolution.

00:12.378 --> 00:15.325
They came up with some basic negotiating rules.

00:15.919 --> 00:20.603
The first is to identify the goal and not the position from which you start arguing,...

00:21.073 --> 00:25.419
...because the latter may limit arriving at a solution that benefits both parties.

00:25.967 --> 00:30.591
Any particular position is twofold, either you are successful or you are not.

00:31.159 --> 00:34.093
Secondly, people often negotiate emotionally.

00:34.561 --> 00:39.229
Then, you lose objectivity because you don't consider the other person's stance.

00:40.068 --> 00:42.920
It is better to think of your opponent as a partner,...

00:43.236 --> 00:45.365
...whom you work with, rather than against.

00:46.205 --> 00:48.293
The third rule involves creativity.

00:48.875 --> 00:55.517
Look at both parties' interests and arrive at options whereby everyone will be in a win-win situation.

00:56.107 --> 01:02.776
You need to let go of personal standards and concentrate on objective ones that everyone can agree upon.
