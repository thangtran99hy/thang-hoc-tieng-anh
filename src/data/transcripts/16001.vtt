Here are some basic investment ideas that might help you.

00:05.738 --> 00:11.160
The first idea suggests that you should increase your stocks when young by borrowing money.

00:11.907 --> 00:15.475
You should borrow one dollar for every one dollar of your own money.

00:16.277 --> 00:20.507
It is safe because young people have many years of future salaries ahead.

00:21.259 --> 00:27.463
Secondly, people think that buying stocks is a good long-term option, yet this is not always true.

00:28.198 --> 00:30.654
Japanese investors know all about this.

00:31.264 --> 00:33.396
Thirdly, pertain to index funds.

00:34.238 --> 00:39.315
Traditionally, you overweighed overvalued stocks and underweighed undervalued stocks.

00:40.084 --> 00:43.233
With "fundamental indexing," you should do the reverse.

00:43.974 --> 00:48.902
Number four talks about "momentum investors", people who chase hot investments.

00:49.554 --> 00:54.602
It's better to rank stocks by how they performed over one year rather than follow a "hot" tip...

00:54.743 --> 00:56.948
...that foresees some excellent future prospects.

00:57.648 --> 01:03.706
Lastly, commodities futures are in vogue because of inflation worries, but you should be skeptical.

01:04.279 --> 01:07.371
Once they become more popular, their returns could fall.
