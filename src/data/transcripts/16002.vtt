Rather than having money sit in your bank account, it's a good idea to have it work for you by investing.

00:08.059 --> 00:14.816
Even small amounts like 20 dollars, for example, can be put into a DRP, a dividend investment plan.

00:15.653 --> 00:20.528
This way, you buy stock directly from companies and avoid brokers and their commissions.

00:21.388 --> 00:25.595
If you have a few hundred dollars to spare, you could look at an index fund.

00:26.275 --> 00:30.620
You can buy index funds straight from mutual fund companies with no commissions.

00:31.391 --> 00:35.770
This is a good and inexpensive way to start a widely diversified portfolio.

00:36.436 --> 00:41.279
If you have 500 dollars, you may want to consider a discount brokerage account...

00:41.551 --> 00:44.144
...and choose an account option that is ideal for you.

00:44.736 --> 00:47.982
The important thing is that you keep your investment costs...

00:48.352 --> 00:52.187
...and broker fees to less than 2% of the transaction amount.
