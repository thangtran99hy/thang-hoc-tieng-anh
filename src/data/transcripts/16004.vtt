00:01.388 --> 00:04.880
A famous organization came up with five negotiating tips.

00:05.438 --> 00:10.776
Tip number one is never discuss final terms before the end of the negotiations.

00:11.558 --> 00:15.448
You need to get to know your opponent first, and learn about the situation.

00:16.195 --> 00:18.219
The second tip concerns parameters.

00:18.911 --> 00:23.377
You need to find out how far the other person is willing to go and what their limits are,...

00:23.743 --> 00:25.498
...so that you can formulate a proposal.

00:26.103 --> 00:30.546
Number three: Be completely clear about your own needs and wants...

00:30.831 --> 00:33.713
...and in that sense, prepare yourself before the meeting.

00:34.356 --> 00:37.231
Tip number four concerns reasonable parameters.

00:37.844 --> 00:39.653
Find out about a general range,...

00:39.999 --> 00:43.219
...compare what different companies offer, and talk to others.

00:43.890 --> 00:47.681
If you look unprepared or even aggressive, you will lose out.

00:48.353 --> 00:50.023
The point for tip five is timing.

00:50.465 --> 00:52.713
Don't let discussions go on and on,...

00:53.121 --> 00:55.945
...but be conscious of the right time to come to a close.
