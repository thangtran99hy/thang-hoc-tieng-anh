One of the world's most successful investors is Warren Buffett.

00:05.780 --> 00:10.399
From world leaders to old ladies, everyone hangs on every word he utters.

00:11.036 --> 00:13.027
One of his approaches is quite simple.

00:13.679 --> 00:17.207
He says that most investors are not super-investors.

00:17.829 --> 00:20.390
They don't differentiate between price and value.

00:21.033 --> 00:25.313
For example, a skyrocketing stock somehow appears safe and strong,...

00:25.793 --> 00:29.177
...but what we should remember is that risk surfaces...

00:29.253 --> 00:33.522
...when market value equals or surpasses a company's intrinsic value.

00:34.346 --> 00:39.552
So, the connection between risk and price can often be the opposite of what one might think.

00:40.227 --> 00:47.018
For example, Google was hugely risky in 2007 when the market assumed its stocks would soar,...

00:47.488 --> 00:52.004
...becoming less risky in late 2008 when the market was volatile...

00:52.265 --> 00:54.969
...and everyone thought that investing would be suicide.

00:55.576 --> 01:02.137
The best time to invest is when the rift between price and intrinsic value is at its widest.
