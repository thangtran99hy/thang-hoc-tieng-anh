There are situations when it's hard to know what to say...

00:05.094 --> 00:06.441
...or how to approach someone.

00:07.123 --> 00:11.028
The best thing to remember is to be as little invasive as possible.

00:11.687 --> 00:13.815
This means not asking questions like...

00:14.199 --> 00:17.840
..."Who are you?," What do you do?," or "What's your name?".

00:18.809 --> 00:23.491
And definitely never ask anyone about his or her age or marital status.

00:24.085 --> 00:27.146
To comment about a person's appearance can be very tricky.

00:27.766 --> 00:29.386
The biggest blunder in etiquette...

00:29.651 --> 00:34.132
...would be to comment on a person's size. This would be considered extremely rude.

00:34.819 --> 00:37.096
It is best to talk about something neutral.

00:37.707 --> 00:42.677
Cliche and boring as it may sound, this is why "the weather" is such a common starter.

00:43.325 --> 00:46.479
An attempt at neutrality sounds like unoriginal advice,...

00:46.755 --> 00:51.319
...but think about it: You are telling the other person that you are not invading their privacy...

00:51.768 --> 00:54.634
...and because you are talking about something fairly irrelevant,...

00:54.956 --> 00:58.463
...you are testing the other person to see if he wants to get to know you better.
