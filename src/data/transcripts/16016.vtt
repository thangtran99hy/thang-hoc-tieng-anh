People are often apprehensive about dealing with foreigners.

00:05.289 --> 00:10.083
Here are some very basic suggestions that will make the encounter easier for both.

00:10.669 --> 00:13.451
There are some basic rules that will always work well.

00:14.184 --> 00:17.337
Etiquette such as standing up, holding the door open,...

00:17.517 --> 00:22.819
...not avoiding eye contact and shaking hands firmly will make a client feel comfortable.

00:23.565 --> 00:28.999
Don't be shy to ask questions to clarify situations, because this avoids confusion.

00:29.751 --> 00:34.359
Clients appreciate commitment, punctuality and ethical business practices.

00:35.263 --> 00:40.303
Know your client's food preferences when dining out and steer clear of talking about...

00:40.399 --> 00:42.831
...politics, religion and personal issues.

00:43.507 --> 00:49.787
Good topics would be their country, weather, sports, places to visit in your country and so on.

00:50.674 --> 00:55.127
When you introduce yourself, not all cultures take the same business approach.

00:55.704 --> 01:02.177
For example, you may get a better reception with a self-depreciating attitude than a self promotional one.

01:02.556 --> 01:05.393
It is always better to check your clients' culture.
