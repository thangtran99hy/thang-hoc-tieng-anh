00:02.711 --> 00:05.391
It is kissing? I don't know.

00:06.409 --> 00:09.783
It's when you have a special feeling inside.

00:10.498 --> 00:15.017
You just be happy, and well, it's happy like Cupid comes out.

00:16.085 --> 00:18.001
It feels like a happy day.

00:18.785 --> 00:21.978
Love is when you feel like you feel good for someone.

00:22.130 --> 00:25.425
You love them more like anyone else.

00:25.497 --> 00:28.619
You just think that they're the greatest people on the Earth.

00:29.745 --> 00:35.944
You like somebody and you hug them.

00:37.576 --> 00:40.670
When I love someone, I give them a present.

00:43.472 --> 00:46.742
I would go up to her and I'd say, "I love you. Will you marry me?"

00:47.367 --> 00:49.261
Just give it straight out, right to her.

00:50.585 --> 00:52.228
And then give her the ring, obviously.

00:52.665 --> 00:56.190
He does this and then they kiss.

00:56.929 --> 00:58.285
He kisses the girl.

01:01.065 --> 01:05.600
Maybe, like a nice mansion at a sunset near...

01:07.189 --> 01:11.781
I think it's actually nice to kind of give a little speech,...

01:11.868 --> 01:15.676
...like some kind of speech showing that he really does love her a lot.

01:16.463 --> 01:19.299
"Can you please, please marry me?"

01:21.829 --> 01:23.223
She might say yes.

01:23.591 --> 01:25.085
"Yes, I'll marry you."

01:26.151 --> 01:29.773
A diamond ring will be, I guess,...

01:30.626 --> 01:36.445
...it'll be fine for her, but it has to be really shiny.

01:37.004 --> 01:37.507
I guess.

01:38.202 --> 01:39.602
It sparkles.

01:40.245 --> 01:42.123
I think this is what usually happens.

01:42.207 --> 01:46.672
The boy buys a really, really, really nice ring for the engagement ring.

01:47.092 --> 01:48.991
He just wants her to say yes, you know.

01:49.596 --> 01:53.289
You put them on and it looks so pretty.

01:55.282 --> 02:05.865
They wanna have more family and they wanna have a baby.

02:06.555 --> 02:09.119
I don't know how you get a baby even.

02:10.199 --> 02:14.592
Maybe it comes just by itself.

02:14.680 --> 02:18.495
Maybe it's from magic.

02:20.721 --> 02:22.029
And it's love.

02:23.823 --> 02:27.670
And that's it!
