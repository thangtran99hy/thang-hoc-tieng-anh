Daniel Goleman takes his ideas and concepts from his earlier book, Emotional Intelligence,...

00:07.725 --> 00:13.261
...and he places them in the work environment in this book, "Working with Emotional Intelligence."

00:14.103 --> 00:18.061
Leaders and successful people are not characterized by their IQs...

00:18.393 --> 00:21.718
...or their working skills but by their emotional intelligence.

00:22.412 --> 00:28.040
Many experts agree that emotional intelligence is the gauge with which we can measure...

00:28.129 --> 00:31.274
...an employee's performance on basically any job.

00:31.979 --> 00:36.802
There are twelve personal competencies to master, such as correct self-assessment,...

00:37.097 --> 00:40.397
...initiative, optimism, self-control and so on.

00:41.254 --> 00:49.119
In addition, there are thirteen key relationship skills, such as service orientation, conflict management and building bonds.

00:49.755 --> 00:57.992
The author cites many instances, stories and anecdotes from large multinational companies to non-profit organizations...

00:58.271 --> 01:03.083
...in order to illustrate how these skills and competencies can lead to success...

01:03.503 --> 01:06.274
...or how they can actually hinder achievements.
