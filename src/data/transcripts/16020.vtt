If you would like to venture out and use your skills to start your own business,...

00:05.612 --> 00:07.590
...there are, of course, possibilities.

00:08.359 --> 00:12.283
As a good writer, you could start out providing a resume writing service...

00:12.645 --> 00:15.531
...and go on to freelance writing and public relations.

00:16.307 --> 00:21.351
If you have an eye for photography, you could advertise services for weddings and parties.

00:27.906 --> 00:33.582
If you can produce crafts or you have a lot of unnecessary things, you could sell them on websites.

00:34.344 --> 00:37.899
But a good business idea alone does not guarantee success...

00:38.443 --> 00:40.844
...and having your own business is not for everyone.

00:41.563 --> 00:42.949
You need additional skills.

00:43.691 --> 00:48.595
Broadly speaking, there are four traits that successful entrepreneurs have in common.

00:49.340 --> 00:56.447
They are personal skills, interpersonal skills, critical and creative thinking skills and practical skills.

00:57.074 --> 01:03.364
