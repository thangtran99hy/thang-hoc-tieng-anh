00:01.270 --> 00:04.929
When changing jobs, collect all the information about the new company...

00:05.313 --> 00:11.357
...to find out if the new position offers you growth in terms of finance, pay and technical know-how.

00:11.821 --> 00:17.617
Don't just compare salaries, but find out if there will be pay increases with your current job...

00:17.923 --> 00:22.359
...and what the future salary increments and perks at the new company are going to be.

00:22.986 --> 00:26.294
If they are comparable, then it might be wise to stay put,...

00:26.763 --> 00:31.101
...since you already have job experience, and your present bosses and colleagues...

00:31.161 --> 00:33.675
...know you better than the people at the new company.

00:34.095 --> 00:39.278
It could pay off to gain additional experience and perhaps get into higher-level work...

00:39.595 --> 00:41.883
...than starting from scratch at a new company.

00:42.347 --> 00:46.461
Yet, if there is something new that you will learn at the new company...

00:46.735 --> 00:51.353
...that you can't acquire in your present job, then a change may be worthwhile.

00:51.810 --> 00:55.975
Compare the career prospects at both companies and choose the better.
