00:01.211 --> 00:04.571
One of the common mistakes you might make when changing jobs...

00:04.950 --> 00:09.429
...is that you only offer something that most job seekers would write in their resumes.

00:10.077 --> 00:12.617
You should know that you are reducing your market value...

00:12.961 --> 00:16.374
...by offering the same experience and knowledge as other people.

00:16.997 --> 00:20.806
By offering and highlighting something different, you can increase your value.

00:21.372 --> 00:25.215
Your actual value in the job market depends on what you can offer...

00:25.501 --> 00:27.851
...and how much the market wants or needs that.

00:28.358 --> 00:32.471
Boost your market value and show that you add value in all that you do.

00:33.202 --> 00:36.889
One more common mistake is that you might only think about salary,...

00:37.455 --> 00:43.363
...but consider all factors like greater independence or opportunities, professional development...

00:43.781 --> 00:46.097
...and working hours that a new job may hold.

00:46.769 --> 00:50.174
Make a simple grid system that compares all information...

00:50.515 --> 00:54.302
...and include bonuses, medical coverage, insurance and so on.

00:55.056 --> 00:57.122
Mark those items that you are concerned about.
