A text becomes unclear when you use too many words or if you use complicated words in a business report.

00:09.361 --> 00:14.667
Wanting to impress the reader or thinking that we ought to write in this way is often the reason.

00:15.515 --> 00:21.359
But the fact is that it is difficult for people to follow the meaning of a complex and flowery text.

00:22.093 --> 00:25.357
Therefore, misunderstandings occur and time is wasted.

00:26.169 --> 00:28.593
Writing should express, not impress.

00:29.264 --> 00:33.447
The more technical and difficult the matter is, the simpler the writing should be.

00:34.187 --> 00:39.452
Sentences should be short, and too many words of 3 or 4 syllables should be avoided.

00:40.131 --> 00:42.673
Use 15 to 25 words per sentence.

00:43.405 --> 00:47.531
One more important thing is that emoticons commonly used in Korea...

00:47.701 --> 00:54.903
...like T T or 2 carets are considered cute in Asia, but considered unprofessional in the Western business world.

00:55.521 --> 00:58.385
They are used in private emails and on chat lines.
