One of the cultural differences between East and West is about saying "No."

00:06.445 --> 00:12.166
Foreigners want an exact "Yes" or "No" unlike Korean culture where being nice is appreciated.

00:12.719 --> 00:17.425
For Koreans, rejecting a request outright is considered very bad manners,...

00:17.906 --> 00:23.245
...because we may offend the other person, feel selfish, or make the other person feel embarrassed...

00:23.335 --> 00:26.405
...for having asked, and they may lose face.

00:27.199 --> 00:32.719
In the Western sphere, especially in the business environment, there are no such considerations.

00:33.205 --> 00:35.918
In fact, saying "No" is considered a strength.

00:36.381 --> 00:42.255
Having agreed to carry out a task without actually doing it is seen as unreliable and untrustworthy...

00:42.594 --> 00:46.685
...especially if you omit giving a valid excuse or explanation.

00:47.342 --> 00:51.795
This cultural misunderstanding leads to frustration and often angers.

00:52.638 --> 00:56.953
People are more expected to acknowledge their limitations and act accordingly.

00:57.628 --> 01:01.134
If you cannot possibly complete a task, you need to say "No."

01:01.641 --> 01:07.045
This way, someone else can take over and whatever task or process is not delayed.
