It can happen that your job, which you really liked, suddenly becomes tiresome...

00:06.723 --> 00:10.102
...and your relationships with clients and colleagues turn sour.

00:10.809 --> 00:16.359
Why? It is possible that there is nothing wrong with your job, but that you need some time off.

00:16.983 --> 00:20.091
But it could also be an indicator that you are fed up with your work.

00:20.847 --> 00:24.831
To find out which it is, you should count the negative and positive impacts.

00:25.543 --> 00:31.275
Negative aspects include questions like: Do you hate the idea of going to work on Sunday night?

00:32.065 --> 00:35.733
Are you bored at work? Do you think negatively about your work?

00:36.509 --> 00:38.157
Has your performance become worse?

00:39.087 --> 00:44.406
On the positive side, questions should include: Do you apply all your skills and talents?

00:45.171 --> 00:50.895
Is the team culture at work enjoyable? Do you feel respect for your co-workers and clients?

00:51.463 --> 00:55.460
Do you feel happy with the available professional development and progress?

00:55.927 --> 00:57.519
Can you take the initiative at work?

00:58.128 --> 01:00.754
Having looked at these questions, what is the answer?

01:01.428 --> 01:03.839
Do you need a little or a permanent break?
