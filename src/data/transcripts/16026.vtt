A definitive way of writing a resume or CV - "curriculum vitae" - doesn't exist,...

00:07.890 --> 00:09.713
...but here are some tips that might help.

00:10.479 --> 00:17.709
Resumes must be tailor-made for specific jobs, have a clear layout, and should be informative but concise.

00:18.440 --> 00:23.178
Unless it is a technical or academic resume where four to five pages are acceptable,...

00:23.576 --> 00:27.058
...you should try to fit your details on about two to three pages.

00:27.866 --> 00:32.373
Don't print on both sides, use separate sheets and put your name in the footer.

00:33.145 --> 00:35.528
Be positive and honest in your descriptions.

00:36.260 --> 00:38.622
The highest qualification is mentioned first.

00:39.129 --> 00:43.215
The upper middle part of the first page is the spot that people tend to focus on.

00:43.787 --> 00:45.944
Try to place important information there.

00:46.430 --> 00:48.337
Don't experiment with strange fonts.

00:48.778 --> 00:53.257
Times New Roman and Arial in size twelve are standard for normal text.

00:53.873 --> 00:56.550
Many resumes are nowadays read on screen.

00:56.957 --> 01:02.673
Therefore, with slightly wider letters, Verdana may be a good choice at font size ten.
