Difficult and unexpected questions are always waiting for you at an interview!

00:06.367 --> 00:09.247
First, take a deep breath and repeat the question.

00:09.909 --> 00:11.972
Think back to your practicing sessions.

00:12.739 --> 00:18.249
If the question is similar to one you have already practiced, then it is half as intimidating.

00:18.855 --> 00:24.004
You can also break the question down into smaller parts, especially multi-part questions.

00:24.345 --> 00:28.525
Example: "Tell me about a time of conflict with a customer...

00:28.791 --> 00:31.813
...and the circumstances and how you resolved the issue."

00:32.386 --> 00:36.170
By answering the first part, you set the scene of how things happened.

00:36.788 --> 00:38.458
The second part is more important.

00:39.007 --> 00:42.090
The interviewer will be less interested in the specifics,...

00:42.501 --> 00:45.991
...but in how you managed to deal with the stressful situation.

00:46.829 --> 00:49.623
This is true for most multi-part questions.

00:50.286 --> 00:55.043
If you don't know how to answer a question, it's best to admit that you are not sure,...

00:55.427 --> 00:58.511
...because most interviewers can tell when you make things up.

00:59.174 --> 01:04.125
Say that you are going to look into this later so that you have this information in the future.

01:04.766 --> 01:08.081
This shows sincerity and that you are prepared to learn.
