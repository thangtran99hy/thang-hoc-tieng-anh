00:01.443 --> 00:06.519
Here are four frequently asked questions that many interviewees find hard to answer.

00:07.429 --> 00:09.776
Number One. "Tell me about yourself."

00:10.275 --> 00:15.785
Here, you need to talk about what you have to offer, your experiences, skills and strengths.

00:16.222 --> 00:18.576
Concentrate on what they want in an applicant.

00:19.306 --> 00:21.972
Number Two. "Why are you leaving your job?"

00:22.706 --> 00:27.257
The interviewer is testing whether there were any problems and if you might become a problem.

00:27.722 --> 00:31.361
Change the focus and reword the answer to emphasize the positive.

00:32.067 --> 00:34.895
Number Three. "Why do you want to work here?"

00:35.491 --> 00:39.723
Talk about your research about the company, their policies and mission statement.

00:40.250 --> 00:43.588
Or else, say that you've attended the interview to find out if...

00:43.689 --> 00:45.299
...this would be the right place for you.

00:46.024 --> 00:48.452
Number Four. "What is your weakness?"

00:49.045 --> 00:54.489
Always a difficult one, because you might give the interviewer a lot of information with your shortcomings.

00:55.032 --> 00:59.125
Mention a negative aspect, but tell how this could also be seen positively,...

00:59.480 --> 01:02.453
...or mention what you are doing to overcome the weakness.
