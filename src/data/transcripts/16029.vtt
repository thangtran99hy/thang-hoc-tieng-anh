00:01.252 --> 00:02.700
From the moment you resign,...

00:02.852 --> 00:07.890
...expect attitudes toward you to change; it'll be as if you have left already.

00:08.476 --> 00:11.366
It's your choice whether or not to tell your co-workers.

00:11.764 --> 00:12.504
Remember, though,...

00:12.851 --> 00:18.423
...that they will only hear the truth from you - management may explain your departure differently...

00:18.695 --> 00:20.617
...and will not admit to any wrongdoing.

00:21.351 --> 00:26.481
Irrespective of contract, the actual leaving date may not be up to you.

00:27.091 --> 00:31.710
You may be asked to leave immediately, because you could be seen as a security risk.

00:32.415 --> 00:37.427
ID and company credit cards will be revoked, and passwords and locks changed.

00:38.115 --> 00:41.657
Make sure you hand in everything because you don't want to be blamed for...

00:41.737 --> 00:44.344
...anything that goes wrong after you give notice.

00:45.097 --> 00:50.613
Clear out your desk and take all personal things a day or so before you announce your departure,...

00:51.221 --> 00:55.625
...because you may be escorted out and not have a chance to return to your desk.

00:56.022 --> 00:57.766
These are today's realities.
