00:01.118 --> 00:03.874
Reasons for job changes can be various.

00:04.371 --> 00:10.639
Whether it's the bad atmosphere at work, differences with superiors, lack of career perspectives...

00:10.960 --> 00:14.973
...or dissatisfaction with the salary, a move should be well planned.

00:15.612 --> 00:19.493
It's important that you do not give notice before you have secured a new job.

00:20.006 --> 00:23.602
However, it might not be the best practice to rub it in,...

00:23.949 --> 00:25.725
...because your boss might be offended.

00:26.389 --> 00:28.984
There is no formula to determine the right moment.

00:29.573 --> 00:31.939
Many employers think that the time has come...

00:32.240 --> 00:35.732
...when you are experienced in routinely fulfilling your duties.

00:36.393 --> 00:41.667
However, you have to remember that it will not be enough to carry out duties routinely.

00:42.385 --> 00:45.449
You will probably be expected to come up with innovations.

00:46.367 --> 00:50.071
See if there are ways to develop new skills within your present job.

00:50.709 --> 00:54.080
You could also consider a sideways move within your industry...

00:54.545 --> 00:56.810
...where your present knowledge comes in handy.

00:57.340 --> 00:59.753
For example, if you are a programmer,...

01:00.020 --> 01:03.137
...you could look at technical sales or project management.
