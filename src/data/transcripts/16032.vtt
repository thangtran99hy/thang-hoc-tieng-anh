00:01.202 --> 00:03.836
In order to give a good impression at an interview,...

00:04.170 --> 00:07.389
...it is best to arrive at least 10 minutes before the start.

00:08.188 --> 00:11.319
When greeting someone, make sure that your handshake is firm,...

00:11.661 --> 00:14.907
...that you make eye contact, and that you have a friendly expression.

00:15.687 --> 00:17.783
Don't avoid eye contact during the interview,...

00:18.125 --> 00:20.264
...and don't slouch or fidget in your seat.

00:21.129 --> 00:23.465
Ask if you haven't understood something clearly.

00:24.230 --> 00:26.279
An interview is not a one-way street.

00:26.841 --> 00:31.049
Behave in a respectful manner, but also evaluate your interviewers,...

00:31.321 --> 00:35.619
...and think critically about the values of the organization and how you are treated.

00:36.201 --> 00:39.339
Be clear about the hiring process and what happens next,...

00:39.653 --> 00:42.614
...i.e. when and from whom to expect a call.

00:43.442 --> 00:45.928
Don't give the appearance that you are desperate for work...

00:46.303 --> 00:47.687
...and that you would take any job.

00:48.287 --> 00:50.439
Switch your cell phone off during the interview.

00:51.074 --> 00:55.049
Take responsibilities for your decisions and don't come up with excuses.

00:55.559 --> 00:58.743
Looking for work can be hard and may take its toll on you,...

00:59.219 --> 01:02.357
...but never show your frustrations and stay positive.
