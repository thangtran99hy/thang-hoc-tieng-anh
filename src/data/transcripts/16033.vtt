00:01.777 --> 00:03.535
Time is a valuable resource.

00:04.127 --> 00:06.181
Everyone gets the same amount of time,...

00:06.560 --> 00:11.508
...but we cannot get any more time regardless of how much we would be willing to pay for it.

00:12.239 --> 00:14.547
Although money is also a valuable resource,...

00:14.884 --> 00:16.952
...it is renewable and limitless.

00:17.499 --> 00:19.699
When I'm out of money, I can earn some,...

00:20.022 --> 00:21.753
...or I can ask to borrow some.

00:22.263 --> 00:24.711
However, money also provides privileges.

00:25.349 --> 00:29.174
I can pay somebody to do my tasks, which gives me free time.

00:29.907 --> 00:34.605
In spite of these differences, there are also many parallels between time and money.

00:35.219 --> 00:37.111
You can save and spend both.

00:37.658 --> 00:41.220
Both are in demand and there is never enough of either of them.

00:41.804 --> 00:46.794
Whichever is more valued depends on the individual and their personal circumstances.

00:47.424 --> 00:51.062
The question is really, "How do I want to spend the time that I have?"

00:51.802 --> 00:56.010
"Do I want to sacrifice my valuable time earning or saving more money...

00:56.452 --> 00:59.215
...or do I want to spend it with other pursuits?"

00:59.755 --> 01:03.661
For most people, though, it will mean not choosing either one or the other,...

01:04.116 --> 01:07.235
...but an ongoing battle to find a balance between the two.
