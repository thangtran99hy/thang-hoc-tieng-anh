For centuries, Jews all over the world have been celebrating Hanukkah.

00:04.425 --> 00:06.070
But now, for the first time in history,...

00:06.191 --> 00:10.079
...NBA stars and celebrities want to wish you a "Happy Holiday."

00:10.617 --> 00:14.386
Sports icon Shaquille O'Neal told me he was familiar with Hanukkah...

00:14.660 --> 00:17.028
...and had the following message for his fans.

00:17.625 --> 00:21.172
To all my Jewish people, I love you. Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah.

00:21.617 --> 00:23.341
Stay out of trouble. Love you.

00:23.745 --> 00:27.160
Like every holiday, Hanukkah has its special songs.

00:32.711 --> 00:33.696
You know any Hanukkah songs?

00:34.056 --> 00:35.095
The Hanukkah songs?

00:35.255 --> 00:35.566
Yeah.

00:35.631 --> 00:36.627
No, no, no, no.

00:37.575 --> 00:38.152
You wanna learn one?

00:38.512 --> 00:40.349
No. Well, let me hear one.

00:45.325 --> 00:47.371
Oh no! You say...

00:54.459 --> 00:56.919
I said it wrong. That was good. That was good. All right. Cool.

00:56.987 --> 00:57.899
Let's try an easy one.

00:58.122 --> 00:58.235
How about...

01:02.887 --> 01:05.383
Happy Hanukkah to all my fans.

01:06.397 --> 01:09.317
What do you have to say to your Jewish fans for Hanukkah?

01:12.440 --> 01:13.171
How do you know about that?

01:14.215 --> 01:15.686
I got a lot of Jewish friends, bro.

01:16.577 --> 01:22.283
The miracle of Hanukkah took place at this location over 2,170 years ago.

01:22.614 --> 01:24.495
It's where the Temple once stood.

01:24.754 --> 01:27.056
What do you have to say to your fans in Israel, Kobe Bryant?

01:27.705 --> 01:31.109
Stay up. I know you guys are going through a tough time right now. Stay up.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.474
Any message for Hanukkah for your Jewish fans out there?

01:33.744 --> 01:34.265
Hanukkah?

01:34.432 --> 01:36.012
Yeah. The Festival of Light.

01:36.117 --> 01:40.559
I just hope everyone has a great holiday. Spend it with the ones you love.

01:41.293 --> 01:45.522
Cherish every memory because time is moving fast.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.457
Any message for them? It's Hanukkah these days.

01:59.291 --> 02:03.363
Happy Hanukkah! You guys have fun and blow out all the candles.

02:03.643 --> 02:04.260
No, we don't blow it.

02:05.187 --> 02:06.257
Well, just keep them torched.

02:06.680 --> 02:08.615
Cuba, any message for your fans in Israel?

02:08.905 --> 02:15.931
Yes, my baby. I'm coming soon. I love you. You are God's people.

02:16.648 --> 02:21.131
People of color, which I love and, you know, be strong.

02:21.695 --> 02:24.695
Nowadays, one of the hottest names in Hollywood is Paris Hilton.

02:25.039 --> 02:28.285
Seems like no news report could be complete, if she's not included.

02:29.029 --> 02:30.713
Paris, what do you want to say to your fans in Israel?

02:30.977 --> 02:32.090
Hi, Israel! Love you.

02:33.824 --> 02:35.098
Hope you have a great Hanukkah.

02:35.191 --> 02:38.583
Make sure to get your menorah, your candles, and of course, your dreidel.

02:38.932 --> 02:42.531
From North Hollywood, California, for Shaq, Kobe, and the rest of the fellows,...
