00:18.606 --> 00:20.780
He is Asgard's mightiest warrior.

00:22.003 --> 00:24.691
The Yotin had come for what is rightfully ours.

00:24.767 --> 00:26.876
Wrong Yotin, you've come here to die.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.339
But in his quest to defend his homeland,...

00:34.647 --> 00:37.732
...he was tricked into releasing an unspeakable evil.

00:38.701 --> 00:42.781
You have the power to open the cave and destroy the Yotin forever.

00:44.077 --> 00:44.477
No!

00:48.946 --> 00:54.829
With the boiling hatred of a billion souls we live again!

00:56.152 --> 00:58.764
Now, he must embark on an epic journey.

01:01.313 --> 01:04.088
You are far from home, Odin's son.

01:05.118 --> 01:07.658
Here you will fall.

01:08.822 --> 01:11.229
Fueled by all the powers of the storm.

01:11.477 --> 01:13.452
I'll feed your bones to the swamp!

01:14.585 --> 01:16.391
Driven by vengeance.

01:16.792 --> 01:18.395
Asgard will burn.

01:19.741 --> 01:21.715
I have unleashed this weapon upon Asgard.

01:42.342 --> 01:43.243
For Asgard!
