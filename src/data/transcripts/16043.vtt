I tracked the lives of 5,000 people as they attempted to achieve their New Year's resolutions.

00:06.110 --> 00:10.973
Now most of them failed, but ten percent did obtain their aims and ambitions.

00:11.450 --> 00:13.310
But what were they doing was so different.

00:13.699 --> 00:16.854
But it all came down to five simple principles.

00:17.452 --> 00:21.509
First of all, they broke their goal into a series of smaller steps.

00:21.997 --> 00:25.653
Second, they told their friends and family what they were trying to achieve.

00:25.998 --> 00:30.151
So that elicited more of a fear of failure but also a sense of support.

00:30.989 --> 00:36.025
Third, they frequently reminded themselves about the benefits of obtaining their goal.

00:36.810 --> 00:42.282
Fourth, they gave themselves a small reward each time they obtain one of their small steps.

00:42.736 --> 00:45.367
And finally, they mapped out their progress.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.687
Either on the spreadsheet, on the fridge door or in a journal.

00:48.951 --> 00:51.219
So, they knew exactly where they were.

00:51.477 --> 00:56.235
And those are the five key principles to actually achieving your New Year's resolutions.
