If your life were a book and you were the author, how would you want your story to go?

00:13.401 --> 00:16.804
That's the question that changed my life, forever.

00:18.079 --> 00:23.223
Growing up in a hot Las Vegas desert, all I wanted was to be free.

00:24.223 --> 00:29.834
I would daydream about travelling the world living in a place where it snowed,...

00:30.938 --> 00:35.361
...and I would picture all of the stories that I would go on to tell.

00:37.351 --> 00:43.684
At the age of 19,  the day after I graduated highschool, I moved to a place where it snowed.

00:44.283 --> 00:46.836
And I became a massage therapist.

00:47.503 --> 00:55.303
With this job, all I needed were my hands and my massage table by my side and I could go anywhere.

00:56.581 --> 01:05.784
For the first time in my life I felt free, independent and completely in control of my life.

01:07.764 --> 01:11.113
That is, until my life took a detour.

01:13.049 --> 01:16.685
I went home from work early one day with what I thought was the flu.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.695
And less than 24 hours later I was in the hospital,...

01:22.477 --> 01:26.649
...on life support with less than a two percent chance of living.

01:28.383 --> 01:29.842
It wasn't until days later,...

01:30.595 --> 01:36.858
...as I lay in a coma, that the doctors diagnosed me with bacterial meningitis.

01:37.684 --> 01:39.971
A vaccine preventable blood infection.

01:42.288 --> 01:48.079
Over the course of two and a half months, I lost my spleen, my kidneys,...

01:48.820 --> 01:53.617
...the hearing in my left ear and both of my legs below the knee.

01:55.301 --> 02:00.860
When my parents wheeled me out of the hospital I felt like I have been pieced back together...

02:01.682 --> 02:06.329
...like a patchwork doll. I thought the worst was over,...

02:07.445 --> 02:10.835
...until weeks later when I saw my new legs for the first time.

02:12.424 --> 02:19.425
The calves were bulky blocks of metal with pipes bolted together for the ankles.

02:20.207 --> 02:27.870
And a yellow rubber foot with the raised rubber line from the toe to the ankle to look like a vein.

02:29.245 --> 02:33.151
I didn't know what to expect but I wasn't expecting that.

02:35.122 --> 02:42.181
With my mom by my side and tears streaming down our faces...

02:43.431 --> 02:48.181
...I strapped on this chunky legs and I stood up.

02:50.117 --> 02:55.672
They were so painful and so confining that all I can think was,...

02:56.632 --> 03:00.116
..."How am I ever going to travel the world on these things?"

03:01.185 --> 03:06.625
"How was I ever going to live the life full of adventure and stories as I always wanted?"

03:08.028 --> 03:10.277
And how was I going to snowboard again?
