Recognized as the ultimate dining guide,...

00:12.581 --> 00:16.885
...there's no denying Michelin's rich history which dates back to 1900...

00:17.200 --> 00:20.349
...when two Frenchmen by the names of Andre and Edouard Michelin...

00:20.584 --> 00:25.903
...first published a guidebook to be offered free of charge to motorists traveling around France.

00:26.293 --> 00:27.143
It's a beautiful story.

00:27.470 --> 00:29.981
I mean, it's called the Michelin Guide for one specific reason,...

00:30.321 --> 00:31.737
...because it belonged to this tire company.

00:32.132 --> 00:36.837
And Andre and Edouard Michelin in the 1900 decided to create a little book in France...

00:37.231 --> 00:38.973
...in order to help the motorists travel around.

00:39.031 --> 00:41.781
I mean, we talk of a time that you were not born, I was not born.

00:42.041 --> 00:44.245
But there was like 3,500 cars in France.

00:44.585 --> 00:45.339
They decided to say,...

00:45.474 --> 00:48.622
"We will produce a little red guide which is called the Michelin Guide,...

00:48.687 --> 00:52.553
...and we're gonna give that for free to all the people who travel, to all the motorists."

00:53.086 --> 00:54.455
And they decided with this little guide...

00:54.526 --> 00:56.591
...to give information about how to inflate your tires,...

00:57.941 --> 00:59.079
...where to find gasoline,...

00:59.154 --> 01:01.441
...because we're talking about a time where there was no petrol station anywhere,...

01:01.911 --> 01:03.960
...and where to stop in a little village,...

01:04.084 --> 01:06.787
...and at the same time where to eat and where to sleep.

01:07.254 --> 01:10.165
And that's really the beginning of the Michelin Guide in 1900 in France.

01:10.669 --> 01:12.371
Now, 110 years later,...

01:13.152 --> 01:16.349
...we obviously continue to do what we've been doing for 110 years...

01:16.435 --> 01:20.165
...and we're covering not only France, but we're covering now, 23 countries.

01:20.343 --> 01:24.099
We're talking about a sale of 1.2 million books each year.

01:24.373 --> 01:27.371
And today, with 100 inspectors travelling the globe,...

01:27.691 --> 01:32.265
...the Michelin Guide has selected 15,000 establishments on three continents.

01:32.518 --> 01:35.925
The restaurants range from virtual palaces to simple shops.

01:36.307 --> 01:37.790
For those in the food industry,...

01:37.927 --> 01:41.531
...it's generally regarded as the highest accolade one can receive.
