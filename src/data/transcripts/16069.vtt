What in the world is Kwanzaa?

00:03.014 --> 00:07.722
Basically, Kwanzaa is a holiday that salutes and recognizes...

00:07.979 --> 00:11.945
...the cultural roots of people of African descent.

00:12.475 --> 00:14.291
But what does the word "Kwanzaa" mean?

00:14.753 --> 00:21.913
Kwanzaa? Kwanzaa means the "first fruits of the harvest" and the language of Kiswahili,...

00:22.469 --> 00:25.537
...which is spoken in certain parts of Africa.

00:26.243 --> 00:27.608
When do you celebrate Kwanzaa?

00:28.325 --> 00:32.742
Kwanzaa is celebrated from December 26 to January 1st.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.963
Well, where does Kwanzaa come from?

00:35.307 --> 00:39.441
The roots of Kwanzaa come from certain African harvest celebrations.

00:39.777 --> 00:46.549
In 1966, Dr. Maulana Karenga developed Kwanzaa from the perspective...

00:47.047 --> 00:50.782
...of Africans in America and all around the world.

00:51.369 --> 00:53.631
Is Kwanzaa a religious celebration?

00:54.107 --> 00:58.787
Kwanzaa is not religious or political; it's cultural.

00:59.504 --> 01:03.385
What I wanna know is, can you give gifts on Kwanzaa?

01:03.989 --> 01:09.330
Yeah, you can give gifts during Kwanzaa, but the point is, don't go broke doing it.

01:09.633 --> 01:12.379
The gifts of the Swahili should be something...

01:12.751 --> 01:17.542
...practical and meaningful like a book or something that you or another African has made.

01:18.015 --> 01:22.377
Okay, I get it. I get it. Kwanzaa is just a black version of Christmas, right?

01:22.969 --> 01:27.616
No, no, no. Kwanzaa has nothing to do with Christmas.

01:27.815 --> 01:33.832
It has meaning to us as a people; it's more like a cultural reaffirmation.
