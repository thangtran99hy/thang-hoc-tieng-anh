What I like particularly with "Dinner in the Sky" is that it's a very creative concept.

00:04.551 --> 00:07.453
Creative about the table in itself,...

00:07.650 --> 00:13.129
...the food you give to all your 22 guests and also about what you are doing on the table.

00:13.736 --> 00:15.023
Because you can do a meeting,...

00:15.113 --> 00:18.086
...you can do all sorts of things connected with gastronomy...

00:18.210 --> 00:19.697
...or not connected with gastronomy.

00:20.700 --> 00:22.936
Then, the location is very important.

00:23.062 --> 00:27.601
Here, Dolce La Hulpe welcomes us in a really outstanding location.

00:27.980 --> 00:32.069
But we can also have other locations connected to national marvels...

00:32.153 --> 00:35.115
...like the Grand Canyon, for instance, like the Niagara Falls.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.493
People talking to us, they want to have it in Masai Mara,...

00:38.669 --> 00:41.166
...to have "Dinner in the Sky" at Festival de Cannes.

00:41.335 --> 00:45.007
We are very mobile so we can go everywhere and in every location...

00:45.450 --> 00:46.869
...without spoiling anything.

00:47.853 --> 00:51.573
The last thing where we can be creative is what we are doing today,...

00:51.803 --> 00:53.012
...is to have a sudden crane...

00:53.255 --> 00:56.581
...and to organize an original entertainment for our guests.

00:56.702 --> 00:59.207
Today, we have a piano here and a violin.

00:59.495 --> 01:01.687
So we can entertain them with music.

01:01.938 --> 01:04.567
But we can also be more practical with,...

01:04.673 --> 01:07.067
...for instance, a presentation in the sky.

01:08.761 --> 01:11.485
It's just a table, it's a table in the sky.

01:11.728 --> 01:13.271
So it's not a question of function.

01:13.382 --> 01:15.715
It's connected with a child's dream,...

01:15.815 --> 01:19.641
...with what you had in mind when you were children.

01:20.185 --> 01:24.620
With "Dinner in the Sky," it works great. Really, I say that the sky's the limit!
