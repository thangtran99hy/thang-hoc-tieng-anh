00:00.039 --> 00:01.834
Miso soup over McDonalds.

00:01.910 --> 00:06.455
More Japanese people are watching what they eat as companies watch workers' waistlines.

00:06.672 --> 00:07.721
Here's CNN's Kyung Lah.

00:11.015 --> 00:17.507
One by one, belly by belly, the guts came out and got measured.

00:18.841 --> 00:21.881
Naoki Wada is not looking forward to this.

00:22.359 --> 00:27.397
At 36.6 inches, he is overweight according to the Japanese government.

00:27.646 --> 00:30.313
And that just won't do under new national guidelines.

00:30.665 --> 00:32.023
And if he doesn't lose weight,...

00:32.354 --> 00:35.795
...his company faces massive fines and increased government health premium.

00:37.312 --> 00:41.536
"This goal is really tough", says NEC's human relations manager, it's a challenge.

00:42.238 --> 00:43.674
Companies and local governments...

00:43.757 --> 00:48.664
...must now measure the waistlines of all employees and family members over the age of 40.

00:49.087 --> 00:53.982
Men over 33 and a half inches and women over 35 and a half inches...

00:54.091 --> 00:55.467
...are considered overweight.

00:56.127 --> 01:01.261
Now if you're thinking that's not fat, well this is a nation that's not so big...

01:01.656 --> 01:03.438
...but one that is getting bigger.

01:04.039 --> 01:06.362
This is what the traditional Japanese meal looks like.

01:06.436 --> 01:08.569
Some vegetables, miso soup and some fish.

01:08.911 --> 01:11.071
Total calorie count about 600.

01:12.104 --> 01:16.729
But along came American fast food. This is a Big Mac, large fries and coke.

01:17.079 --> 01:22.178
Total calorie count 1300, more than twice the Japanese meal.

01:23.145 --> 01:25.565
You won't find American food in this cafeteria.

01:25.901 --> 01:31.239
NEC, facing 19 million dollars in penalties if its employees don't slim down,...

01:31.593 --> 01:33.987
...is encouraging a low-calorie healthy diet.

01:34.245 --> 01:35.315
Physical test tomorrow.

01:36.199 --> 01:41.489
It's why he's chosen today's healthy meal, hopeful but not expecting it will help tomorrow.

01:41.867 --> 01:43.834
So, are you scared?

01:44.762 --> 01:46.537
"Well, a little bit", he says.

01:48.456 --> 01:50.200
Hoping to get employees moving,...

01:50.325 --> 01:54.331
...the company pumps out exercise music over the loudspeaker twice a day.

01:56.388 --> 02:00.765
It's encouraging employees to take the stairs and exercise at every other floor.

02:00.918 --> 02:07.807
Can you imagine the US government telling people, "We want you to go down a waist size 33?"

02:08.071 --> 02:09.119
It's difficult to imagine.

02:09.295 --> 02:13.768
American NEC employee Joseph Jasper says, "Sure, it seems a little extreme."

02:14.147 --> 02:16.499
But maybe there's a lesson here for his home country.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.518
There are things we can all learn from each other and...

02:18.659 --> 02:22.615
...that this happens to be something that is good for your health.

02:23.366 --> 02:29.471
NEC says they can't force employees to slim down but it has issued Naoki Wada a pedometer,...

02:29.909 --> 02:32.842
...hoping he'll walk in next time with a lighter load.

02:33.847 --> 02:35.631
