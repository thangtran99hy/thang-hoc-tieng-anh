Hi. I'm Alex and I'm a product manager working on Flight Search.

00:09.375 --> 00:11.740
And today, I'm going to show you how you can use Flight Search...

00:11.837 --> 00:14.547
...to plan a trip even when you don't know where you wanna go.

00:15.271 --> 00:18.111
Let's assume for example, that there's a three-day weekend coming up,...

00:18.252 --> 00:21.264
...and I'm feeling adventurous, and want to explore a new destination.

00:22.037 --> 00:25.747
I have a budget of about $400 and I know I want to fly nonstop...

00:26.421 --> 00:28.256
...because that way, I could make the most of my time.

00:28.891 --> 00:31.177
If I go into Flight Search, I'll immediately see this map.

00:31.315 --> 00:32.563
And this map shows all the cities...

00:32.632 --> 00:35.869
...I can fly to from my local airport and at what price.

00:36.043 --> 00:38.427
Now as I mentioned, I want to fly nonstop.

00:38.570 --> 00:39.899
So, I can actually just go ahead...

00:39.982 --> 00:42.295
...and click on the nonstop filter on the left.

00:42.663 --> 00:45.339
And what will happen is that the map will automatically update...

00:45.539 --> 00:48.193
...to just show the destinations that you could fly nonstop.

00:48.549 --> 00:51.332
The ones that you can't are hollowed out, or disabled.

00:51.590 --> 00:54.901
And the ones that you can will actually show the cheapest, nonstop price.

00:55.490 --> 00:58.417
Now, you'll remember that I also want to make sure I don't miss work.

00:58.840 --> 01:01.748
So, what I can actually do is go ahead and apply a time filter,...

01:01.831 --> 01:03.359
...and say , "I just want to see the cities...

01:03.453 --> 01:05.803
...that I can fly to after work." for example.

01:06.079 --> 01:07.632
And once again, the map will update...

01:07.783 --> 01:10.729
...and it will show me the lowest prices within those requirements.

01:11.945 --> 01:14.456
Finally, I can go ahead and put in that budget.

01:14.873 --> 01:17.863
And at this point, I'm looking at the cities that match my search terms.

01:18.256 --> 01:21.229
I can zoom in and explore all sorts of different places...

01:21.296 --> 01:23.115
...and hover over to see the prices.

01:23.528 --> 01:25.227
This one here actually looks pretty good.

01:25.436 --> 01:26.890
So, let's go ahead and click on that.

01:27.191 --> 01:29.914
And when I do, you'll see that the results come back instantly.

01:30.237 --> 01:32.317
I can select an outbound that looks good.

01:32.591 --> 01:34.127
I can select the return flight.

01:34.246 --> 01:36.855
And finally, I can click through to book that ticket.

01:38.018 --> 01:40.585
We hope you find it that easy to use Google Flight Search...

01:40.670 --> 01:42.407
...to explore new destinations.

01:42.553 --> 01:42.946
Thanks.
