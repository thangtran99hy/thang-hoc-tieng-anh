The significant part of the story of my life is my own family.

00:07.097 --> 00:14.464
We came out here, rented places and enjoyed the beach and enjoyed the swimming.

00:14.879 --> 00:19.189
The really remarkable coincidence is that when I married Mary Maxwell,...

00:19.329 --> 00:23.993
...her family had a long tradition of a regular summer stay at...

00:24.839 --> 00:29.108
...Hood Canal, including stays here at Alderbrook where we're sitting today.

00:29.433 --> 00:34.235
We'd swim, play tennis. It was a special thing and now...

00:34.872 --> 00:39.152
...you know, I've got a place where my dad, my sisters and...

00:40.156 --> 00:42.643
...all of dad's grandchildren come out here quite a bit.

00:42.730 --> 00:46.563
So, we're continuing a tradition of time at Hood Canal.

00:47.145 --> 00:51.968
The Cheerio thing was actually just a parallel...

00:52.121 --> 00:55.045
...and an added Hood Canal experience.

00:55.499 --> 00:57.825
When we got together with family, friends and...

00:58.291 --> 01:01.183
...children that came out here for a two weeks stay.

01:01.525 --> 01:05.040
Now, the Cheerio was a group of ten families and...

01:05.366 --> 01:10.219
...so, for a couple of weeks, we'd just be with those other kids and a lot of activities,...

01:10.656 --> 01:14.219
...sports activities, dinners at the other people's house,...

01:14.317 --> 01:16.949
...campfires with skits and singing.

01:17.770 --> 01:20.945
So, I have great memories of growing up here and...

01:21.279 --> 01:23.325
...you know, coming back to the same place year after year,...

01:23.441 --> 01:29.516
...there's a certain predictability and comfort in doing that.

01:29.759 --> 01:32.747
Almost every year, I've been out here and I'll keep doing it.
