Turkish tea drinking is a bit different than the customs we know from England at 4:30,...

00:06.126 --> 00:09.149
...or the elaborate ritual of the tea ceremony in Japan.

00:10.141 --> 00:14.427
It is less complicated and very straightforward, kind of like the Turks themselves.

00:16.695 --> 00:23.165
Get your glass poured, you plunk in one or two sugars according to your taste,...

00:23.748 --> 00:29.273
Take your spoon, stir it. Make a lot of noise with that spoon, a lot of noise.

00:32.833 --> 00:35.338
Hold it by the edge because it's very, very hot.

00:36.029 --> 00:37.412
Sip very slowly...

00:39.285 --> 00:45.121
...because it's hot and also because you're going to have to drink several of these glasses.

00:46.209 --> 00:48.768
Just like potato chips, you just can't have one,...

00:49.082 --> 00:51.920
...for etiquette requires that at least three be served to you.

00:53.353 --> 00:58.817
So, that means you're going to be drinking a lot of tea in Turkey, at all hours of the day.

01:00.430 --> 01:05.614
So, as I said, in my eyes, this little glass of tea is the symbol of all of Turkey.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.327
Turkish tea is ruby red.

01:12.581 --> 01:15.395
Not black or green, but red.

01:16.339 --> 01:19.884
Red is the spirit of patriotic blood flowing in the heart of every Turk.

01:20.636 --> 01:23.272
Red is their flag they wave with great pride.

01:24.026 --> 01:27.015
Red is the rich wool of the colorful carpets they weave.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.725
Red is the dancing tulips of their spring time meadows.

01:31.261 --> 01:37.067
The form of those tulips is reflected in the very shape of the tea glass itself.
