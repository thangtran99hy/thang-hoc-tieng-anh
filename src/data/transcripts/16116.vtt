We've got 20 14 to 19-year-old kids...

00:18.370 --> 00:21.895
...to get them to do a kind of "ready, steady, cook" style cooking day.

00:21.971 --> 00:23.203
We've split them up into groups.

00:23.260 --> 00:24.989
We've given them each an apprentice...

00:25.486 --> 00:27.641
...and given them all fresh ingredients.

00:27.801 --> 00:31.995
The theme of the day is fish, so we've given them four pieces of fish each.

00:32.074 --> 00:34.417
And they've got to fillet, gut, take the gills out,...

00:34.487 --> 00:36.591
...so it's probably stuff that they've never ever done before.

00:37.050 --> 00:41.565
The food we've got here today, I literally got in the kitchen about seven o'clock in the morning.

00:41.671 --> 00:43.125
I just grabbed a little bit of everything:...

00:43.445 --> 00:49.065
...olive oils, vinegars, olives, a massive array of herbs and vegetables and...

00:49.305 --> 00:51.489
...some of the fresh pasta that we make in the restaurant.

00:51.565 --> 00:54.402
I just brought it down here and it's absolutely fantastic.

00:54.857 --> 00:58.829
These kids are using probably some of the best produce that you can possibly get.

01:00.331 --> 01:01.153
Yeah, it's going really well.

01:01.922 --> 01:03.559
We've got a few who are quite determined.

01:03.641 --> 01:04.455
They know what they want to do.

01:04.705 --> 01:06.230
We just help them put some dishes together.

01:06.511 --> 01:08.814
In the sense that showing other people what cooking is about now,...

01:08.881 --> 01:10.447
...you don't have to know how to cook this or that.

01:10.851 --> 01:11.879
It's just like getting stuff in there.

01:11.955 --> 01:12.731
 Just do it, it's fun.

01:13.484 --> 01:15.179
You don't know what you can do until you do it really.

01:15.747 --> 01:16.646
We're all here for the same reason.

01:17.015 --> 01:18.887
Everyone's here trying to cook and have fun...

01:18.960 --> 01:21.513
...and we're trying to show them how fun cooking actually can be.

01:21.809 --> 01:25.473
I think that Fifteen's involvement with these things is just fantastic.

01:25.607 --> 01:26.861
It's just so much fun,...

01:27.147 --> 01:30.379
...and I feel like I am making a little bit of an impression via Fifteen and it's great.

01:30.617 --> 01:31.825
I just feel fantastic about it.

01:32.207 --> 01:35.217
And I think it's something in the middle of their summer holiday that they're gonna remember.
