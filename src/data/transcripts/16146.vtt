00:03.164 --> 00:06.993
When it comes to succeeding professionally, attention to detail counts for a lot.

00:07.530 --> 00:10.322
Learn the rules of etiquette in time for your next business meeting.

00:10.969 --> 00:16.579
You will need preparation, punctuality, proper dress, manners,...

00:16.771 --> 00:19.177
...completion of tasks and a thank you note.

00:19.789 --> 00:24.079
Step one: Be prepared with pen and paper and any pertinent information...

00:24.143 --> 00:25.504
...that will help contribute to the meeting.

00:26.155 --> 00:27.949
Practice attention to detail for meetings...

00:28.009 --> 00:30.387
...so that you don't have to leave the room for something you forgot.

00:31.392 --> 00:34.959
Business meetings are for sharing information, not socializing.

00:35.288 --> 00:36.295
Act professional. 

00:36.824 --> 00:41.363
Step two: Get there at least five minutes early and wear your game face.

00:41.904 --> 00:44.793
Punctuality conveys appropriate focus and respect.

00:45.464 --> 00:50.405
Step three: Once the meeting begins, leave the PDA and phone in your pocket...

00:50.495 --> 00:53.318
...to eliminate the slightest chance of diversion or interruption.

00:54.067 --> 00:57.376
Step four: If you're not running or presenting at the meeting,...

00:57.833 --> 00:59.396
...hold your peace until the meeting breaks up...

00:59.555 --> 01:01.763
...or wait until the principal invites comments.

01:02.365 --> 01:05.053
Don't interrupt others and raise your hand if you have questions,...

01:05.345 --> 01:08.219
...which should be pithy and relevant to everyone in attendance.

01:08.982 --> 01:11.880
Step five: Show manners and pay attention.

01:12.331 --> 01:17.646
Don't drum, tap, fidget, flip through the reading material, or cast looks around.

01:18.431 --> 01:23.457
Step six: Go easy on alcohol and food at catered meetings and conferences.

01:24.106 --> 01:27.370
You are there to do business, not fill up as if it were a party.

01:28.079 --> 01:29.209
Keep your eye on the ball.

01:30.237 --> 01:34.491
Step seven: Maintain etiquette even after the meeting by completing tasks...

01:34.735 --> 01:38.071
...assigned as goals during the discussion as quickly as possible.

01:38.747 --> 01:41.923
File meeting notes afterwards to keep track of and report on later.

01:42.727 --> 01:43.441
Did you know?

01:43.751 --> 01:48.632
The first business cards, called visiting cards, announced the arrival of the aristocracy.

01:49.127 --> 01:51.119
Used as a social convention among the elites...

01:51.187 --> 01:53.987
...during the reign of Louis XIV in the 17th century,...

01:54.492 --> 01:56.761
...they eventually became today's business cards.
