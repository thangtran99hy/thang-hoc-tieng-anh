00:05.565 --> 00:09.162
Learn how to snag a great salary without putting the job offer in jeopardy.

00:09.440 --> 00:14.939
You will need national and regional salary data, patience, an asking price...

00:15.311 --> 00:19.021
...convincing arguments, confidence and potential compromises.

00:19.871 --> 00:24.711
Step one: Find out what similar positions pay both nationally and in your region...

00:24.789 --> 00:27.543
...by typing "salary comparison" into a search engine...

00:27.769 --> 00:29.717
...for websites that provide this information.

00:29.935 --> 00:32.256
Step two: Wait to discuss salary...

00:32.332 --> 00:35.531
...until the interviewer has indicated interest in offering you the job.

00:35.876 --> 00:38.593
Otherwise, you risk alienating them right off the bat.

00:39.004 --> 00:43.707
Step three: Try to get them to tip their hand first by asking what the position pays.

00:44.013 --> 00:46.163
Generally, the first person to name a number...

00:46.232 --> 00:48.669
...is the one who will be on the losing end of the negotiation.

00:49.416 --> 00:52.621
Asking for the salary range gives you both some wiggle room.

00:53.089 --> 00:56.642
Step four: If they insist you give your salary requirements first,...

00:56.769 --> 01:00.842
...give them the number you arrived at based on your experience, your salary history,...

01:01.023 --> 01:04.464
...and the research you've done on the market value of similar positions in your region.

01:04.847 --> 01:06.991
Then add another ten percent for good measure.

01:07.526 --> 01:09.457
If your number is negotiable, say so.

01:09.911 --> 01:13.799
Step five: Once they make a firm offer, see if you can push it higher...

01:13.879 --> 01:17.581
...by offering a polite, cogent argument for why you are worth more to them.

01:17.899 --> 01:20.051
Back up the argument with quantitative evidence...

01:20.121 --> 01:22.092
...relating to the business you'll bring to the company...

01:22.206 --> 01:24.644
...or how you'll save money by improving efficiency.

01:25.512 --> 01:26.735
Exude confidence.

01:27.103 --> 01:30.385
If you enter the negotiation feeling like you don't deserve a higher salary,...

01:30.570 --> 01:34.451
...your potential employer will know you aren't going to argue when they offer you less.

01:34.771 --> 01:38.941
Step six: After they counter your argument, remain quiet for a beat or two,...

01:39.044 --> 01:41.000
...as though you're pondering what they've said. 

01:41.347 --> 01:45.819
The ensuing and uncomfortable silence just might prompt them to cough up some more dough.

01:46.155 --> 01:48.069
Step seven: They're not budging?

01:48.353 --> 01:51.090
Try to negotiate other perks like more vacation time.

01:51.551 --> 01:53.711
If they are asking you to take a significant pay cut,...

01:53.967 --> 01:56.859
...see if you can negotiate a four-day workweek or working from home.

01:57.789 --> 02:01.956
Did you know? Women who consistently negotiate their salary increases...

02:02.067 --> 02:04.967
...earn at least one million dollars more throughout their careers...

02:05.045 --> 02:08.163
...than women who just accept what is offered, according to one study.
