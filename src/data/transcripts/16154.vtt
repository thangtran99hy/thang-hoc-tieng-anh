The three step assertive technique is used to firmly but courteously put your point of view.

00:15.563 --> 00:17.267
It involves making three statements...

00:17.497 --> 00:22.035
...using a calm and even voice while retaining an upright, relaxed posture.

00:22.585 --> 00:25.476
First, you summarize the other person's point of view...

00:25.911 --> 00:29.288
...then express yourself by saying what you think or feel.

00:29.823 --> 00:31.911
Finally, you suggest an action.

00:32.473 --> 00:35.697
It often helps to use the following phrases as a memory aid.

00:36.286 --> 00:37.687
I understand you think...

00:38.418 --> 00:39.561
However, I feel...

00:40.138 --> 00:41.559
Therefore, I suggest...

00:42.783 --> 00:44.873
I'm not sure that I can achieve this goal.

00:45.169 --> 00:47.791
I understand that you think the objective is too challenging.

00:48.481 --> 00:51.519
However, I do feel it's just the type of target you've achieved in the past.

00:52.299 --> 00:54.615
Therefore, I suggest to draw up a project plan...

00:55.093 --> 00:58.181
...based on how you meet this goal and we can review together next week.
