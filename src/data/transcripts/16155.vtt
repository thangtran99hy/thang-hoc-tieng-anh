00:00.700 --> 00:05.025
Well, I'm not convinced that the work is as urgent as this report suggests,...

00:05.456 --> 00:06.243
...so perhaps we should...

00:06.348 --> 00:09.467
Oh come on, the building is practically falling down!

00:09.583 --> 00:12.076
Sorry Lin, I don't think Tan had finished.

00:12.368 --> 00:13.528
We'll get to you in a minute.

00:13.865 --> 00:14.437
Sorry.

00:14.937 --> 00:19.752
As I was saying, perhaps we should get a second opinion before we spend any money.

00:20.545 --> 00:21.628
Thank you, Tan.

00:22.245 --> 00:23.632
What's your opinion, Walter?

00:24.651 --> 00:28.576
Well, as far as I'm concerned, it's a question of safety, so I think we should go ahead.

00:29.224 --> 00:31.259
Are you suggesting that someone could get hurt?

00:31.487 --> 00:32.545
In my opinion, yes.

00:33.215 --> 00:35.672
If you ask me, there is a serious risk of an accident.

00:36.211 --> 00:37.527
And it's not a recent problem.

00:38.673 --> 00:40.945
Are you implying we should have done something earlier?

00:41.493 --> 00:43.958
Much earlier. It's a real concern.

00:44.157 --> 00:44.871
Hear, hear!

00:46.171 --> 00:49.929
In that case, I agree. We should do something now.

00:50.223 --> 00:51.083
I think so, too.

00:52.407 --> 00:53.377
Thank you, Walter.

00:54.243 --> 00:55.542
Well, if there's no...

00:55.667 --> 00:57.061
Excuse me, Madam Chairperson.

00:57.179 --> 00:57.885
Yes, Barbara.

00:58.249 --> 01:01.791
What about the problem with parking? There were no places again this morning.

01:02.311 --> 01:03.994
Maybe if you got to work on time...

01:04.407 --> 01:07.082
All comments through the chair if you don't mind, Walter.

01:07.617 --> 01:09.889
Parking isn't on the agenda for this meeting.

01:10.265 --> 01:12.877
Perhaps you could suggest it for our next meeting, Barbara.

01:14.062 --> 01:17.387
Well, if there's no more discussion, we'll put it to a vote.

01:17.762 --> 01:18.535
Hear, hear!
