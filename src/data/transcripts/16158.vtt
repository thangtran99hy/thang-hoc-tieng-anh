Hello, Lin Chen,...

00:02.294 --> 00:04.011
...Sales Manager for National Sugar.

00:04.274 --> 00:06.096
And my associate, Jon Marton.

00:06.209 --> 00:10.411
Very pleased to meet you. I'm Victor Tang and this is my legal adviser Sue Peney.

00:10.707 --> 00:12.083
I hope you had a pleasant flight over.

00:12.399 --> 00:13.395
Yes, we did. Thanks.

00:13.573 --> 00:14.786
Are you staying for a few days?

00:15.053 --> 00:17.301
Unfortunately, we need to get back to Manila tomorrow.

00:17.899 --> 00:19.575
Well, we'd better get down to business.

00:25.324 --> 00:26.905
Mr. Tang, to start off with,....

00:27.104 --> 00:30.315
...I just want to say we believe we could offer you a very good deal...

00:30.510 --> 00:32.290
...and come up with a win-win result.

00:33.181 --> 00:36.838
Well, from our point of view, we see it as an exploratory talk.

00:37.227 --> 00:38.591
Testing the water you might say.

00:38.878 --> 00:41.409
We don't intend to reach any agreements at this meeting.

00:41.887 --> 00:44.697
In any case, we would need to run it past our board first.

00:45.135 --> 00:46.535
You haven't heard our terms yet.

00:46.677 --> 00:48.464
You may find them hard to resist.

00:50.056 --> 00:53.451
Of course, we understand you need time to consider any offer.

00:53.839 --> 00:56.901
My first priority is to keep the negotiations open.

00:58.094 --> 00:59.625
What's your proposal, Ms. Chen?

01:00.149 --> 01:04.065
We're prepared to offer a very attractive price for a minimum sale...

01:04.424 --> 01:06.189
...in exchange for a two-year contract.

01:06.609 --> 01:08.111
Jon will clarify the terms.
