My name is Helen Peng.

00:04.371 --> 00:08.501
I'm the manager of learning and development with Pratt-Whitney Canada right now.

00:08.639 --> 00:11.103
And I've been with Toastmasters for three years.

00:17.486 --> 00:19.055
Number one I would say, be on time.

00:19.191 --> 00:22.225
A lot of people, they don't attend a meeting on time...

00:22.334 --> 00:26.299
...and then that's going to jeopardize your credibility whether you're reliable or not.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.280
Number two, dress properly.

00:28.498 --> 00:32.731
If you're at a business setting, you probably have potential clients so dress in business suits.

00:32.907 --> 00:36.591
We always say, "There's no reality, there's always perception."

00:36.668 --> 00:40.917
So, the way you dress, the way you present yourself creates a certain perception in the workplace.

00:41.073 --> 00:44.753
Number three, if you are at the professional meeting and there are people you don't know,...

00:44.974 --> 00:46.694
...be proactive and introduce yourself.

00:47.005 --> 00:52.315
You probably will make a potential friend and then it will be very easy to do business later.

00:52.791 --> 00:55.122
Another thing I will say, always be prepared.

00:55.385 --> 00:58.917
Never expect to wing it. Because you prepare for a meeting,...

00:59.006 --> 01:02.834
...you get your message to come across. It's also respect for other people's work.

01:03.177 --> 01:05.527
Number five, listen attentively.

01:05.775 --> 01:08.875
When you are at the meeting listen to others, what they're sharing,...

01:09.001 --> 01:13.553
...what their perspectives are, not just think about what you have to say.

01:13.844 --> 01:18.261
When you express yourself at a professional meeting, be concise and to the point.

01:18.502 --> 01:23.015
Make sure your message has come across properly; don't drag too long.

01:23.410 --> 01:26.834
If you're disagreed by someone, be open-minded,...

01:27.068 --> 01:31.509
...don't be defensive. Listen to the point if there's any merit in the truth.

01:31.655 --> 01:34.209
And if there is, accept it willingly.

01:34.734 --> 01:37.059
When you're not clear about certain things,...

01:37.428 --> 01:41.617
...ask; ask questions, summarize or rephrase what you have heard.

01:41.911 --> 01:44.324
Make sure you understand everything correctly.

01:44.899 --> 01:46.663
Whenever you leave a professional meeting,...

01:46.765 --> 01:51.705
...always come to an agreed action plan because you have to make sure what's next.

01:51.895 --> 01:53.725
What comes out of this meeting has been followed up.

01:54.251 --> 01:56.548
And the very last point after the meeting,...

01:56.741 --> 02:02.147
...send out a summary including the action plan if there's no minutes that's been recorded.

02:02.514 --> 02:05.789
Those are the ten points I think that would be helpful for a professional setting.
