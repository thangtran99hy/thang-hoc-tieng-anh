A lot of great products and successful business start-up in the UK come out of the universities.

00:06.192 --> 00:10.174
Next into the den is James Barnham who hopes to be the latest example of that.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.495
He's asking the dragons for 150,000 pounds.

00:16.607 --> 00:18.945
Hello, dragons! My name is James Barnham.

00:19.412 --> 00:23.191
I have a first-class honors degree in Industrial Design from London South Bank University.

00:23.624 --> 00:26.642
I've invented a product that stops baths from overflowing automatically.

00:28.644 --> 00:35.185
Now, today I'm going to ask you for 150,000 pounds for ten percent equity of my company.

00:37.739 --> 00:43.315
In the UK, the insurance industry pays out a whopping 250,000,000 pounds per year...

00:43.504 --> 00:46.430
...clearing up the damage caused from people leaving taps running.

00:47.056 --> 00:51.581
But I have the solution, if I can give you a demonstration.

00:55.677 --> 00:57.434
This is my Nova-Flo product.

00:57.797 --> 01:01.950
It's a small mechanical unit that fits underneath the taps on the bath.

01:03.266 --> 01:07.053
Because it's mechanical, it's intrinsically safe because there's no electrical supply or batteries.

01:07.792 --> 01:12.301
It's easily fitted to both UK and European tap dimensions and will take about 20 minutes to fit.

01:14.581 --> 01:15.859
If I can give you a typical scenario.

01:17.825 --> 01:22.207
There you are at home running the bath, the next thing you know your friend phones,...

01:22.536 --> 01:23.967
...so you run downstairs to answer the phone.

01:24.719 --> 01:27.411
Now this is a dangerous point, your bath is filling up with water,...

01:28.193 --> 01:30.872
...but thankfully you have Nova-flo fitted so the tap stop.

01:32.375 --> 01:35.571
As far as it goes, it's such a simple device that to reset this...

01:36.218 --> 01:39.362
...all you need to do is to make sure that there is no more water going through the overflow outlet...

01:39.952 --> 01:41.427
...and then simply turn off the taps.

01:43.451 --> 01:46.345
Turn them back on again, the unit is completely reset.

01:47.473 --> 01:49.345
Now, I'd like to talk to you a little bit about the market.

01:49.855 --> 01:54.045
In year one, we've got a projected turnover of 25,000 units.

01:54.335 --> 01:59.061
In year two, 75,000 units and year three, 150,000 units.

02:00.248 --> 02:04.112
In year one, we're having Nova-Flo produced in the UK for 13 pounds per unit.

02:05.276 --> 02:07.605
In year two, we're gonna have Nova-Flo produced in China...

02:07.860 --> 02:09.970
...where we can have them made for five pounds per unit,...

02:10.176 --> 02:15.823
...and we'll be selling this by direct sales for 60 pounds and to the distributors for 35 pounds.

02:15.881 --> 02:19.219
So, everybody can make their markup and I'm still making decent margins.

02:20.982 --> 02:21.826
Can I answer any questions?
