00:08.210 --> 00:11.949
You will therefore assume the position of a suppliant before this throne.

00:12.089 --> 00:13.548
She was a superstar.

00:13.649 --> 00:14.682
You will kneel.

00:15.411 --> 00:17.973
Arguably, one of the last Hollywood legends,...

00:18.217 --> 00:19.206
I'm alive!

00:19.458 --> 00:21.271
...in a long and outsized life.

00:21.607 --> 00:24.419
Elizabeth Taylor played in more than 50 films,...

00:24.495 --> 00:26.464
You can't afford to waste good liquor.

00:26.718 --> 00:28.059
..and had seven husbands.

00:28.142 --> 00:32.313
Most of them, especially our favorites Richard Burton and Mike Todd,...

00:32.911 --> 00:35.083
...gave her eye-popping jewels.

00:36.401 --> 00:40.300
Some of her jewels are up for sale at Christie's auction house in New York.

00:40.739 --> 00:44.440
The competition to buy something, anything, is fierce.

00:45.147 --> 00:49.171
The week before the auction, thousands paid to view the collection.

00:49.469 --> 00:57.511
What Elizabeth Taylor means to me and to so many is movies, marriages and millions.

00:57.693 --> 01:01.514
I can't imagine wearing such gorgeous dresses.

01:01.621 --> 01:05.840
And then this really big, gaudy jewelry; it was just overwhelming.

01:06.014 --> 01:12.183
No matter how beautiful the diamonds, rubies and emeralds, nothing outshone her beauty.

01:12.572 --> 01:15.406
Marc Porter, chairman of Christie's Americas,...

01:15.862 --> 01:20.481
...called it the greatest collection his auction house has handled in 20 years.

01:20.691 --> 01:25.128
It's the world's greatest collection of jewelry and this is now being revealed to the public.

01:25.199 --> 01:28.333
It's also one of the most important collections of fashion of the 20th century.

01:28.597 --> 01:32.755
Porter says that Taylor kept all the jewels in her Beverly Hills home.

01:33.342 --> 01:36.227
Christie's spent six months cataloging them.

01:37.493 --> 01:40.701
One of the most precious is a 16th century pearl,...

01:40.797 --> 01:46.395
...the centerpiece of a ruby and diamond necklace designed by Cartier and Taylor herself.

01:46.941 --> 01:51.778
At 50 carats, it was the first night's biggest seller; almost 12 million dollars.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.518
Brett Sherlock of Christie's Canada...

01:55.896 --> 02:00.269
...says that the pearl was discovered in the bay of Panama 400 years ago...

02:00.676 --> 02:04.721
...and was in the Spanish crown jewels for more than 200 years.

02:05.018 --> 02:07.893
Eventually sold to an American, sold at an auction...

02:08.259 --> 02:12.193
...and purchased by Richard Burton in 1969 for approximately 32 thousand dollars.

02:12.649 --> 02:16.040
Burton also gave Taylor a 33 carat diamond ring.

02:16.405 --> 02:19.314
It sold for an incredible nine million dollars.

02:19.746 --> 02:20.929
To me, she's the queen.

02:21.011 --> 02:25.505
Pop star Michael Jackson, a friend of Taylor's, gave her presents too...

02:26.319 --> 02:29.509
...like this necklace with matching earrings, also auctioned.

02:30.407 --> 02:35.509
The collection is vast with important pieces containing diamonds and other gems.

02:36.427 --> 02:41.833
Like the Taj Mahal, the diamond and jade necklace created in late 17th century.

02:42.375 --> 02:47.897
It went for 8.8 million dollars, a world auctioned record for an Indian jewel.

02:48.391 --> 02:52.231
The items in auction also document Taylor's fashion sense...

02:52.475 --> 02:55.946
...containing glamorous gowns and jackets by the house of Versace.

02:56.663 --> 02:59.552
This jacket has a 20 thousand dollar value.

03:00.403 --> 03:04.728
There are expensive handbags by Hermes and clutches by Chanel.

03:05.971 --> 03:09.395
Meredith Etherington Smith worked on the fashion collection.

03:09.980 --> 03:15.095
She says that Taylor paid for everything herself, unlike many of today's stars.

03:15.175 --> 03:19.497
This is not stuff stylists or designers gave her, she wrote checks.

03:19.924 --> 03:21.736
This is her wardrobe.

03:21.892 --> 03:25.249
85, 90 on this telephone now. 95 thousand!

03:25.467 --> 03:30.515
Christie's estimate of a 50 million dollar sale was more than doubled in the first night.

03:31.201 --> 03:35.317
The net proceeds from the four-day sale will go to Taylor's estate...

03:35.661 --> 03:39.104
...with a portion going to the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS foundation.

03:40.259 --> 03:42.514
