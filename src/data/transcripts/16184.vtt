00:03.407 --> 00:06.076
What other aspects of tourism and hospitality are there?

00:06.590 --> 00:08.079
Well, why do you go anywhere?

00:08.719 --> 00:15.011
You're motivated to travel somewhere based on information that you've received, one way or another, about the destination.

00:15.947 --> 00:20.046
You've received this information either prior to your trip in the generating region,...

00:20.428 --> 00:23.260
...for instance, by reading a book or looking on the Internet,...

00:23.680 --> 00:27.373
...or possibly on the transit route, at airports for instance,...

00:27.679 --> 00:31.373
...or in the destination region, maybe at a tourist information office.

00:32.059 --> 00:35.592
So, information is Leiper's eighth point.

00:37.045 --> 00:42.991
The next point is that tourism involves change to your daily routine and activities.

00:43.825 --> 00:48.542
For a while, you experience a different way of life, a kind of time out,...

00:48.896 --> 00:51.414
...and you will be doing things that you may not normally do.

00:52.927 --> 00:58.997
Leiper's tenth point is that as a tourist, you expect that there will be a reasonable degree of security.

00:59.737 --> 01:05.244
You want the places you travel to to tolerate tourist visitors and, ideally, be hospitable.

01:05.919 --> 01:07.986
This is where the link with hospitality comes in.

01:08.509 --> 01:11.569
Hospitality is extremely important in tourism...

01:11.883 --> 01:16.134
...because people need a sense of hospitality in order to feel comfortable in a place.

01:17.151 --> 01:18.598
Travelling can be quite stressful.

01:19.023 --> 01:23.221
You're in an unusual place, you don't know the people, and you may not know the language.

01:23.920 --> 01:30.890
There must be the sense that there is going to be a reasonable degree of personal security, otherwise people won't travel.

01:32.137 --> 01:34.405
The next point concerns finances.

01:35.246 --> 01:39.525
As a tourist, you will expect that your visit is going to be economically feasible...

01:40.096 --> 01:42.397
...and that the activity will be worth the money spent.

01:42.691 --> 01:45.445
Otherwise, you wouldn't have embarked on the journey in the first place.

01:46.421 --> 01:50.337
The final aspect is that tourists depend on the tourism industries,...

01:50.575 --> 01:54.798
...like hotels, accommodation providers and the food and beverage industry.

01:55.668 --> 01:57.055
This is a bit of a gray area.

01:57.632 --> 02:04.959
Supermarkets, for instance, are not specifically aiming to foster or support tourism, but still many tourists rely on them.

02:06.280 --> 02:07.788
So this is the end of your journey.

02:08.055 --> 02:13.855
You've traveled from home, your TGR, and you've spent at least one night away, your TDR.

02:14.453 --> 02:17.429
You've traveled to your destination via a transit route.

02:17.974 --> 02:24.007
You've participated in leisure activities, experienced a different culture and a different daily routine.

02:24.798 --> 02:28.995
You've received information about your destination, either at home or on arrival.

02:29.685 --> 02:31.767
You've felt safe, secure and welcome.

02:32.647 --> 02:34.603
You feel that your money was well spent.

02:35.266 --> 02:40.581
You've used tourist facilities and hospitality businesses, before finally returning home.
