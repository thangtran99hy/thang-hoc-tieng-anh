I just wanna start with a little bit of a word of warning and that is my job here tonight...

00:08.212 --> 00:10.293
...is to be a little bit of a Dr. Bring Me Down.

00:10.665 --> 00:16.505
So, bear with me for a few minutes and know that after this, things will get lighter and brighter.

00:17.364 --> 00:21.241
So, let's start. I know that many of you have heard the traveler's adage...

00:21.322 --> 00:24.265
..."Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints".

00:25.447 --> 00:29.415
Well, I'm gonna say that I don't think that's either as benign nor as simple as it sounds.

00:29.806 --> 00:34.967
Particularly, for those of us in industries who are portraying people in poor countries,...

00:35.419 --> 00:37.559
...in developing countries and portraying the poor.

00:38.148 --> 00:41.345
And those of us in those industries are reporters, researchers...

00:41.416 --> 00:46.156
...and people working for NGOs. I suspect there are a lot of us in those industries in the audience.

00:46.511 --> 00:51.388
And we're going overseas and bringing back pictures like this, of the utterly distressed,...

00:51.773 --> 00:58.212
...or the displaced, or the hungry, or the child laborers, or the exotic.

00:58.895 --> 01:05.638
Now, Susan Suntag reminds us that photographs, in part, help define what we have the right to observe,...

01:05.951 --> 01:08.913
...but more importantly they are an ethics of seeing.

01:09.303 --> 01:12.740
And I think right now is a good time to review our ethics of seeing,...

01:13.173 --> 01:16.587
...as our industries, the reporting, and research, and NGO work...

01:17.003 --> 01:22.241
...are collapsing and changing in part by what's being driven by what's happening in the economy,...

01:22.770 --> 01:25.693
...but is making us forge new relationships.

01:26.073 --> 01:27.570
And those new relationships...

01:27.664 --> 01:32.133
...have some fuzzy boundaries and I've worked at the edge of some of these fuzzy boundaries and I wanna...

01:32.463 --> 01:34.586
...share with you some of my observations.

01:35.097 --> 01:42.790
Now, my ethics of seeing is informed by 25 years as a reporter covering emerging economies and international relations.

01:43.139 --> 01:46.215
And I believe in a free and independent press.

01:46.497 --> 01:51.600
And I believe that journalism is a public good, but it's getting harder to do that job,...

01:52.058 --> 01:57.348
...in part because of the massive layoffs, because the budgets for international reporting aren't there anymore,...

01:57.769 --> 02:03.516
...new technologies and new platforms begging new content and there are a lot of new journalisms.

02:04.065 --> 02:08.365
There's activist journalism, humanitarian journalism, peace journalism,...

02:08.731 --> 02:12.151
...and we are all looking to cover the important stories of our time.

02:12.705 --> 02:18.936
And so we're going to NGOs and asking them if we can embed in their projects.

02:19.613 --> 02:23.959
And this is in part because they are doing important work in interesting places.

02:24.261 --> 02:28.315
And that's one example. Here, this is a project I worked on in the Blue Nile in Ethiopia.

02:28.952 --> 02:34.245
And NGOs understand the benefits of having reporters tag along on their team.

02:34.745 --> 02:38.113
They need the publicity, they are under tremendous pressure.

02:38.581 --> 02:42.257
They're competing in a very crowded market for compassion.

02:43.101 --> 02:48.780
So, they're also looking to reporters and to hire freelance reporters to help them develop their public relations material...

02:49.061 --> 02:50.315
...and their media material.
