00:02.921 --> 00:05.215
So what is PR about then?

00:06.046 --> 00:10.425
There are as many definitions of PR as there are authors and practitioners.

00:11.384 --> 00:14.643
However, a brief survey of definitions from...

00:14.850 --> 00:18.688
...three well-known PR sources will take our understanding forward.

00:20.115 --> 00:27.823
In 1978, the first World Assembly of National Public Relations in Mexico City stated that,...

00:28.399 --> 00:32.765
"Public relations practice is the art of social science...

00:33.108 --> 00:36.215
...in analyzing trends, predicting their consequences,...

00:36.673 --> 00:41.951
...counselling organizational leaders, and implementing planned programs of action...

00:42.241 --> 00:45.467
...which will serve both the organization and public interest."

00:46.928 --> 00:50.952
Looking carefully at this definition, it could be argued that...

00:51.095 --> 00:55.711
...the description "art of social science" is not specific enough.

00:57.266 --> 01:03.183
But I believe asserting that PR is an art, in its widest sense, is useful,...

01:03.731 --> 01:09.955
...since PR requires artistic skills, along with language, writing and public speaking.

01:11.077 --> 01:16.270
PR also uses the scientific instruments and research methods of social science,...

01:16.762 --> 01:22.615
...including monitoring, surveys, and research, to understand and predict human behavior.

01:23.687 --> 01:28.485
This definition also identifies four key elements of public relations,...

01:28.872 --> 01:33.275
...namely, analyzing communication needs, advising management,...

01:33.823 --> 01:37.417
...planning, and implementing communication programs.

01:38.915 --> 01:43.542
The Institute of Public Relations in Britain describes PR as:...

01:44.089 --> 01:49.320
..."the deliberate, planned and sustained effort to establish and maintain...

01:49.464 --> 01:53.355
...mutual understanding between an organization and its publics."

01:54.362 --> 01:56.351
Did you notice the plural there?

01:57.039 --> 01:59.533
The word "public" is, of course, normally singular.

02:00.136 --> 02:02.331
But the use of the plural tells us that...

02:02.441 --> 02:06.127
...organizations have more than one public or sector of...

02:06.205 --> 02:08.515
...the population which they have to convince.

02:09.593 --> 02:12.403
The emphasis in this definition is on planning,...

02:12.741 --> 02:17.441
...although it also identifies the aim of PR to create mutual understanding.

02:18.939 --> 02:22.278
The Encyclopedia of Public Relations states that,...

02:22.625 --> 02:27.199
..."For most of the 20th century, the idea of 'public' served as...

02:27.296 --> 02:30.705
...the central concept in public relations theory and practice."

02:32.006 --> 02:33.546
Let's take the word "public".

02:34.524 --> 02:40.211
We need to distinguish between "public" as in the general public or all ordinary people,...

02:40.910 --> 02:44.569
...and "public" as referring to a special or particular group of people.

02:45.419 --> 02:49.735
PR then, involves two-way communication between different parties,...

02:50.261 --> 02:54.999
...for example, an organization and either a particular group or the community at large.

02:55.793 --> 02:58.191
It advises the organization so that...

02:58.264 --> 03:02.045
...its policies are consistent with the expectations of its publics.

03:02.815 --> 03:07.421
I'll come back to the topic of publics in a later lecture, but for now,...

03:07.702 --> 03:10.728
...I'd like to move on and talk about the importance of PR...

03:10.973 --> 03:13.548
...and its relation to advertising and publicity.
