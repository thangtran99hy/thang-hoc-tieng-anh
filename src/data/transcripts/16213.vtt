00:01.103 --> 00:03.528
Manila, the capital of the Philippines.

00:05.399 --> 00:11.803
With a population of ten million, the city is overflowing with people and the dead.

00:14.035 --> 00:19.452
Manila's North Cemetery is the city's largest, with 70 to 80 funerals a day,...

00:21.636 --> 00:23.696
...and more than one million buried here.

00:25.331 --> 00:26.937
It's filled beyond capacity,...

00:28.035 --> 00:30.014
...spilling over with corpses.

00:31.291 --> 00:33.825
For most, this would be a chilling place to visit.

00:34.507 --> 00:39.851
But to some Filipinos, this sea of tombs and bones is the place they call home.

00:42.091 --> 00:45.136
An entire community built on top of the dead.

00:48.482 --> 00:52.487
Remy Landrito has lived in the city of death since 1988.

00:54.725 --> 00:58.619
A lot of people think it's scary to live here inside the cemetery.

01:01.887 --> 01:04.970
He turned an above ground tomb into a two-story house.

01:05.985 --> 01:09.787
Few people would want to do their laundry only feet away from a corpse in a crypt,...

01:10.778 --> 01:13.145
...or brush their teeth on top of a gravestone.

01:14.461 --> 01:17.360
There's even an empty tomb inside Remy's living room.

01:18.446 --> 01:19.949
This will be the grave for my family.

01:20.978 --> 01:23.086
Whoever is first to go will be buried here.

01:24.133 --> 01:27.688
Remy lives here by choice because this is where he works.

01:28.628 --> 01:31.180
His job is only a few tombstones away.

01:31.890 --> 01:33.388
And it's not for the squeamish.

01:35.873 --> 01:38.981
At least three times a day, Remy must exhume the dead.

01:40.444 --> 01:42.053
With space and money scarce,...

01:42.178 --> 01:47.701
...many poor families must rent burial sites here in what are called the apartments.

01:48.741 --> 01:51.733
And like any tenant, the dead can be evicted.

01:52.549 --> 01:56.366
If the rent isn't paid after five years, the apartment is opened.

01:57.177 --> 02:02.039
Then, it's Remy's job to move the body piece by piece,...

02:03.410 --> 02:05.011
...decomposed or not.

02:06.079 --> 02:08.281
It's a task that took some getting used to.

02:09.043 --> 02:10.793
When I first started here at the cemetery,...

02:11.182 --> 02:14.351
...the first time I handled bones, I couldn't eat for two weeks.

02:17.691 --> 02:18.401
I couldn't sleep,...

02:18.953 --> 02:19.942
...my stomach was upset,...

02:20.438 --> 02:21.354
...I felt like throwing up.

02:24.559 --> 02:26.834
But three weeks in the job, I got used to it...

02:27.267 --> 02:29.332
...little by little, and I started eating again.
