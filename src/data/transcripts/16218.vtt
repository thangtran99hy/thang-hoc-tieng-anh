00:02.769 --> 00:03.573
Let's move on.

00:04.080 --> 00:05.758
What does "tourism" mean?

00:06.265 --> 00:09.154
In a theory of tourism put forward by Professor Leiper...

00:09.266 --> 00:11.233
...in his book "Tourism Management",...

00:11.532 --> 00:15.668
...it is defined as "traveling away temporarily on overnight trips...

00:15.746 --> 00:18.467
...and visiting places for leisure-related purposes."

00:19.584 --> 00:24.051
Leiper explains that there are a number of essential aspects to this definition,...

00:24.170 --> 00:26.046
...which I'll run through very briefly today.

00:27.561 --> 00:31.371
To begin with, tourism involves traveling away from home...

00:31.498 --> 00:34.717
...and expecting to return to your usual residence.

00:35.684 --> 00:39.720
The second point is that you must spend at least one night away:...

00:40.132 --> 00:42.789
...it is, after all, a time when you're away from home.

00:43.681 --> 00:50.433
Thirdly, tourism involves a TGR, and fourthly, a TDR.

00:51.105 --> 00:54.265
In other words, there is a place which the tourist comes from,...

00:54.441 --> 00:57.287
...the TGR or Tourism Generating Region,...

00:57.839 --> 01:01.851
...and a destination, a place which the tourist goes to,...

01:02.253 --> 01:05.894
...the TDR or tourism destination region.

01:06.809 --> 01:10.745
So, if you live in London, then London is your TGR;...

01:11.225 --> 01:13.765
...if you live in Tokyo, then that is your TGR.

01:14.053 --> 01:17.579
That is where you would normally buy the resources that you require.

01:18.142 --> 01:21.156
You will buy your ticket there; you will buy your rucksack there.

01:21.470 --> 01:22.690
You will buy extra clothes.

01:22.941 --> 01:24.873
You will possibly even book hotels...

01:25.219 --> 01:26.949
...through an accommodation booking agency,...

01:27.019 --> 01:29.984
...which, of course, gets paid for that service.

01:30.850 --> 01:34.888
All right, the fourth point is that you would be visiting at least one...

01:34.971 --> 01:38.119
..and possibly many more tourist destinations.

01:38.639 --> 01:42.091
You might be taking just a single trip to one particular place.

01:42.515 --> 01:44.882
You might decide to go to Dubai and spend a week there.

01:45.326 --> 01:46.931
You might be doing a world tour,...

01:47.143 --> 01:50.217
...visiting many different places over a longer period of time.

01:50.852 --> 01:54.943
These are the destination regions, the TDRs.

01:56.353 --> 02:01.033
A fifth and very crucial aspect of tourism is that along the way,...

02:01.388 --> 02:03.887
...you will be traveling via a transit route,...

02:04.399 --> 02:07.707
...by plane, boat, train or any other mode of transport.

02:08.527 --> 02:10.953
This transit route may be the same for the way...

02:11.025 --> 02:13.638
...over as for the way back or it may be different...

02:14.400 --> 02:17.161
...and as a tourist, you have an impact on the transit route.

02:17.750 --> 02:21.190
Planes pollute the environment of countries they fly over, for instance.

02:21.730 --> 02:22.783
Cars make noise,...

02:23.212 --> 02:26.491
...trains draw energy from valuable resources, etc.

02:27.425 --> 02:31.801
So, in summary, you travel from home for at least one night,...

02:32.194 --> 02:34.313
...prepare for your trip in your home area,...

02:34.730 --> 02:38.933
...travel to the tourist destination and use a route to get there...

02:39.239 --> 02:41.069
...before you return home.
