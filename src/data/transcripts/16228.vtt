The price of pork, China's favorite meat, rose sharply this year...

00:05.623 --> 00:07.196
...that's forced many to cut back.

00:07.621 --> 00:09.787
But this shopper jokes she'll never give it up.

00:11.674 --> 00:15.237
If people don't eat pork then their faces turn green, the color of vegetables.

00:15.483 --> 00:16.335
You have to eat meat.

00:17.231 --> 00:18.449
No meat, no strength.

00:19.017 --> 00:22.080
But meat was a luxury in China just a few decades ago.

00:22.697 --> 00:25.515
Food was strictly rationed until the 1980s.

00:26.073 --> 00:28.421
Chinese ate meat only once or twice a month...

00:28.583 --> 00:31.301
...when Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Economist...

00:31.419 --> 00:32.713
...Zhu Ling was growing up.

00:33.795 --> 00:37.999
Only during Chinese New Year could we get 250 grams of pork each.

00:38.581 --> 00:42.885
And I recall I could only get 750 grams of cooking oil per year.

00:44.661 --> 00:47.711
Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms in the 1980s...

00:47.997 --> 00:50.513
...set the stage for China's miraculous growth.

00:51.115 --> 00:53.995
"And as happens everywhere, when people emerge from poverty,..."

00:54.310 --> 00:56.645
"...the Chinese began to eat better," Zhu says.

00:57.675 --> 01:01.025
This was an era of change and improvement in food consumption.

01:01.604 --> 01:04.795
Basically, apart from vegans, everybody, every family...

01:04.888 --> 01:07.603
...has seen an increase in meat and seafood consumption.

01:08.333 --> 01:11.984
Chinese pork consumption has more than doubled since 1990...

01:12.402 --> 01:14.799
...and chicken consumption is up fivefold.

01:15.290 --> 01:16.609
Livestock need to eat, too.

01:16.938 --> 01:19.671
So, feeding those rapidly growing herds and flocks...

01:19.920 --> 01:24.051
...has quickly made China the world's most voracious consumer of soybeans.

01:24.461 --> 01:27.514
According to US Department of Agriculture Analyst Hui Jiang,...

01:27.929 --> 01:31.989
..."Ten to 15 years ago, China imported almost virtually no soybeans at all."

01:32.701 --> 01:38.521
And so, since the mid-1990s Chinese imports have grown drastically...

01:39.536 --> 01:44.009
...to today, dominating over half of the total world trade in soybeans.

01:44.793 --> 01:46.889
This has been positive for American agriculture.
