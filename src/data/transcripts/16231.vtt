Good morning, everybody.

00:04.979 --> 00:08.001
Today, I'm going to talk about public relations research.

00:08.955 --> 00:10.877
Let's start by defining terms.

00:11.682 --> 00:13.729
Firstly, what is research?

00:14.617 --> 00:18.313
The Cambridge International Dictionary of English defines research as...

00:18.810 --> 00:21.700
..."the detailed study of a subject in order to...

00:21.780 --> 00:25.642
...discover new information or reach a new understanding."

00:26.957 --> 00:30.832
Secondly, what do we mean by public relations research?

00:32.013 --> 00:36.417
The Dictionary of Public Relations Measurement and Research describes it as...

00:36.477 --> 00:40.732
..."a communication activity used for gathering information or data."

00:41.815 --> 00:44.803
It looks at the communication relationships that exist...

00:44.945 --> 00:48.758
...between institutions and their target market or audiences.

00:50.243 --> 00:53.552
In seeking answers to their questions, researchers gather...

00:53.750 --> 00:57.961
...facts and opinions on an identified issue, need or question.

00:58.845 --> 01:04.154
As the name implies, PR research focuses on the whole PR process.

01:05.022 --> 01:10.801
It involves the controlled, objective and systematic gathering of data, and its interpretation.

01:11.745 --> 01:15.182
In other words, the method of collecting the data should be...

01:15.343 --> 01:19.113
...organized, planned, managed and impartial.

01:20.461 --> 01:24.296
In today's lecture, we'll look first at the main sources of data,...

01:24.988 --> 01:27.091
...and then we'll look at data collection methods.
