00:00.030 --> 00:02.665
When walking through the center of Barcelona, Spain,...

00:02.823 --> 00:07.587
...one is surrounded by the sights and sounds of the entertainers expressing themselves artistically.

00:07.729 --> 00:10.999
The unique and stimulating atmosphere of this Mediterranean city...

00:11.123 --> 00:14.188
...makes visitors feel like they're attending a party that never ends.

00:14.471 --> 00:18.203
There's something very special about Barcelona, like any time you go out of your house...

00:18.803 --> 00:22.266
...there's always something going on, you'll always find a friend on the streets.

00:23.017 --> 00:27.125
It's where living is. You're not in your place, you're on the streets.

00:27.557 --> 00:32.116
Things happen but they're not organized, like this group we just saw, the circus group.

00:32.447 --> 00:35.215
They're just doing it on their own,...

00:36.501 --> 00:43.773
...mixing with this group of jazz musicians and just doing it, improvising.

00:44.448 --> 00:47.506
The Ramblas is a wide pedestrian-only boulevard...

00:47.611 --> 00:50.922
...that cuts through the middle of the Catalan city and ends at the harbor.

00:51.185 --> 00:53.970
Lined with trees, cafes and market stalls,...

00:54.102 --> 00:58.236
...it often serves as a visitor highlight and meeting place for people of all ages.

00:59.439 --> 01:03.847
Here, you can go out on the street at night, and it's always lively.

01:04.286 --> 01:11.733
There's never nobody in the Ramblas, for example, there's always... every hour a day, there is life.

01:12.529 --> 01:15.143
When I came here, I felt somehow better than in Amsterdam,...

01:15.221 --> 01:19.329
...more alive, more vital, you understand? Vital.

01:20.577 --> 01:24.439
That makes it very enjoyable, at least for me, and inspiring too.

01:32.201 --> 01:38.293
It's a very nice place because in the Ramblas you can find...

01:40.756 --> 01:45.785
...theater, music from Argentina, from Spain, from Africa, from around the world.

01:50.101 --> 01:55.325
On the Ramblas, exciting and remarkable things just seem to happen in an impromptu fashion,...

01:55.519 --> 01:57.079
...without any need for practice.

01:57.286 --> 02:00.129
Things that happen on the street will never happen in a theater.

02:00.531 --> 02:02.202
For example, if we play and like,...

02:02.660 --> 02:07.910
...ten, fifty people start to dance at one time, then you think, "Yeah, this is beautiful."

02:08.847 --> 02:14.991
Ramblas is "the street" in Barcelona, and I think in Europe,...

02:16.082 --> 02:17.688
...and maybe in the world.

02:21.187 --> 02:24.049
You're gonna be entertained no matter how.

02:24.183 --> 02:28.327
 I mean, if you walk past by the flower shops, the way they build them up, it's beautiful.

02:28.891 --> 02:32.945
Even the street is decorated, I mean, you get entertained.

02:33.515 --> 02:34.989
It's worth coming to Barcelona.

02:41.940 --> 02:46.453
In Barcelona, a gangster's statue on a dais in the street is a common sight,...

02:46.728 --> 02:49.917
...but these statues are different, they'll sometimes suddenly move.

02:50.302 --> 02:53.949
This often shocks onlookers and results in laughter from spectators...

02:54.102 --> 02:57.167
...who may have been wondering whether the statue is a performer or not.

02:57.651 --> 03:02.397
Preparation is just like waking up in the morning and putting on your clothes.

03:04.101 --> 03:06.170
There's nothing more to it, you know.

03:06.797 --> 03:10.630
I sit down in front of a mirror, I get a little bit of makeup.

03:10.725 --> 03:12.984
I put it on my face, I put it on my hair.

03:13.963 --> 03:17.083
And then I put on my hat, I put on my suit,...

03:17.651 --> 03:19.778
...I have one look in front of the mirror and then I hit it.

03:25.182 --> 03:25.916
It's a way of life.

03:26.469 --> 03:29.331
Ramblas is... you have everything.

03:29.741 --> 03:33.508
You have traffic of people, you have tourists, you have feasts, you have performers.

03:34.339 --> 03:38.648
Ramblas has everything. It's a vibrant life, it's a way of life.

03:39.941 --> 03:41.845
Truly, truly a way of life, I love it.

03:44.201 --> 03:49.885
It's easy to see how residents and visitors alike can love this vibrant city and its spontaneity.

03:50.069 --> 03:54.143
The exciting streets of Barcelona make life here vital!
