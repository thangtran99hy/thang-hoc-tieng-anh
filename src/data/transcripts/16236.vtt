Hey! Come in Shawn.

00:08.327 --> 00:09.327
Thank you, Mr. Merchan.

00:09.416 --> 00:09.969
How's it going?

00:10.114 --> 00:10.765
Good. How are you?

00:10.849 --> 00:11.733
Good, good, good.

00:12.647 --> 00:14.011
I've called you in here for a few things.

00:14.099 --> 00:14.985
Here, take a seat.

00:15.912 --> 00:17.327
I've called you in here for a few reasons.

00:17.419 --> 00:19.544
As you know, we're doing our quarterly review.

00:20.428 --> 00:24.506
And I've just been going through this checklist here of your reports and that,...

00:24.586 --> 00:27.379
...and, you know, we're pretty satisfied with your performance.

00:27.751 --> 00:29.657
You're here on time every day,...

00:31.367 --> 00:32.303
...you've been working well with others,...

00:32.383 --> 00:34.639
...I mean, you know, people seem to like working with you,...

00:34.730 --> 00:37.417
...and you know, you get your stuff done.

00:37.713 --> 00:39.539
You know, everything's here.

00:39.951 --> 00:44.836
We have been having a slight issue with your TPS report.

00:46.720 --> 00:51.893
You know, we're gonna need you to come in on Saturday and play a little catch up...

00:51.983 --> 00:54.644
...since the reports haven't been up to standard.

00:54.734 --> 00:56.708
You're getting check minuses.

01:07.579 --> 01:08.327
I think it's such a good idea.

01:09.417 --> 01:10.499
That is a terrible idea.

01:10.805 --> 01:11.616
No one's asking you.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.477
We really need to set up a shop in Cambodia.

01:14.223 --> 01:15.173
It's a huge market.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.239
All the numbers are here.

01:36.932 --> 01:40.148
What do you guys think of opening a shop in Cambodia?

01:42.115 --> 01:46.068
Well, it's something we should think about.

01:46.262 --> 01:50.265
But I think we should go over the numbers, one more time maybe.

01:51.191 --> 01:51.829
What do you think?

01:52.627 --> 01:59.491
If the numbers show promise for the future of the company and the rest and then at least...
