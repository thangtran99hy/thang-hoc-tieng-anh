Hi, I'm Katrina Szish for howdini.com.

00:06.857 --> 00:10.555
Nothing makes a bad first impression like a bad handshake.

00:11.025 --> 00:13.927
Here to show us how to avoid that pitfall is Melissa Kirsch,...

00:14.041 --> 00:16.899
...the author of "The Girl's Guide to Absolutely Everything".

00:17.197 --> 00:18.301
Thanks for joining us, Melissa.

00:18.427 --> 00:19.354
Thanks for having me.

00:19.941 --> 00:25.201
One thing that you say is most important about a handshake has nothing to do with the hands.

00:25.609 --> 00:29.335
It's in the gaze: you don't want to be giving that come-hither glance...

00:29.451 --> 00:32.529
...or you don't want to be looking down at your papers on the desk or anything.

00:32.808 --> 00:35.141
You want to be making eye contact with the person that you're meeting.

00:35.297 --> 00:37.197
Okay, now tell me about the grip.

00:37.384 --> 00:39.445
Some people have spaghetti hands.

00:39.839 --> 00:42.663
Some people will be trying too hard to crush you.

00:43.187 --> 00:44.590
What's the proper balance?

00:44.767 --> 00:51.917
We want parallel fingers, strong hand, strong arm; reach in, grip.

00:52.626 --> 00:52.976
Okay.

00:53.170 --> 00:55.751
No shaking, just one grip like this.

00:56.228 --> 01:00.347
Okay, so no shaking, so shaking hands doesn't mean shaking my hand.

01:00.494 --> 01:05.273
Exactly. It's not Hands Across America. It's not Red Rover. It's one shake.

01:05.396 --> 01:10.492
Exactly, no violence, no. We don't want to rip anybody's arm off.

01:10.573 --> 01:12.254
It's just one shake down like this.

01:12.448 --> 01:16.761
Okay. Now, I know some people tend to give a very little delicate handshake.

01:16.883 --> 01:18.329
No mincing handshakes.

01:18.409 --> 01:22.047
We all shook hands with somebody who has all of the moxie of a dead trout.

01:22.330 --> 01:26.344
You want parallel fingers; tight, strong, muscular arm and hand.

01:27.189 --> 01:29.823
What about the shaking? It's called the handshake,...

01:29.905 --> 01:32.245
...and some people like to really shake their hands up and down.

01:32.371 --> 01:33.963
It really should be called a handgrip.

01:34.052 --> 01:37.457
We don't want any pumping, any flailing: just one, quick grip.

01:38.689 --> 01:42.107
Now, what if somebody starts pumping and you're trying just to grip?

01:42.223 --> 01:46.135
How do you stop them from their overzealous handshaking?

01:46.585 --> 01:47.877
Pull that hand out of there.

01:48.379 --> 01:49.635
Just get out of the situation.

01:49.800 --> 01:53.933
Exactly. It may be uncomfortable for a moment, but get yourself out of the situation.

01:54.269 --> 01:56.401
Now, this last question is something that, I think,...

01:56.485 --> 01:59.229
...everyone must admit has happened to them even though they don't want to:...

01:59.805 --> 02:03.873
...you want to shake someone's hands, but your hands are kind of clammy. What do you do?

02:04.639 --> 02:05.945
It happens to the best of us.

02:06.117 --> 02:11.005
A discreet rubbing off of the palms on the skirt or the pants will alleviate that problem.

02:11.145 --> 02:15.228
But, of course, you don't want just your other hand shake or to see that you are wiping your palm.

02:15.308 --> 02:17.167
Exactly. It has to be a stealth move.

02:17.270 --> 02:18.291
Discretion is key.

02:18.488 --> 02:18.783
Right.

02:19.757 --> 02:23.291
Okay well, before I say goodbye let's practice a perfect handshake.

02:24.251 --> 02:25.073
Hopefully, I'll do this right.

02:28.236 --> 02:29.885
Thank you for joining us, Melissa.

02:30.152 --> 02:31.073
Thanks for having me.
