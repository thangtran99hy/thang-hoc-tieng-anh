Hi everyone! I'm Brian Krueger with CollegeGrad.com,...

00:03.863 --> 00:05.500
...and this is the Job Search Minute.

00:06.250 --> 00:08.120
Here's another tough interview question.

00:08.524 --> 00:09.987
"Why should I hire you?"

00:10.918 --> 00:14.001
The easy answer is that you're the best person for that job.

00:14.440 --> 00:16.104
And don't be afraid to say so.

00:16.457 --> 00:20.189
But then, back it up with what specifically differentiates you.

00:21.147 --> 00:25.527
For example, "You should hire me because I'm the best person for this job."

00:26.125 --> 00:30.614
"I realize that there are likely other candidates who also have the ability to do this job,..."

00:31.009 --> 00:35.177
"...yet I bring an additional quality that makes me the best person for the job:..."

00:35.485 --> 00:37.140
"...my passion for excellence."

00:37.518 --> 00:41.720
"I'm passionately committed to producing truly world-class results."

00:42.197 --> 00:43.671
"Let me give you some examples."

00:44.478 --> 00:46.043
Are you the best person for the job?

00:46.580 --> 00:48.937
Show it by your passionate examples.

00:49.519 --> 00:50.994
