Snake expert Gerry Martin is an Indian herpetologist with a talent for uncovering clues.

00:06.217 --> 00:09.837
When a new challenge arises, Gerry is always eager to jump at the chance.

00:10.559 --> 00:14.025
This call for help comes from over 2,200 kilometers away.

00:14.456 --> 00:18.500
A wealthy sheikh in the Sultanate of Oman has a snake park in need of rescue.

00:19.300 --> 00:27.889
So, you say you lost all the snakes? And how many snakes was that? Over 140.

00:28.517 --> 00:31.433
Gerry is amazed, but he is more concerned with something else.

00:31.624 --> 00:35.350
What's killing the snakes? And more importantly, how can it be stopped?

00:35.984 --> 00:39.173
Okay. So, you're planning on getting some new snakes?

00:40.518 --> 00:43.003
The sheikh wants to reopen the park in two weeks.

00:43.567 --> 00:49.123
If Gerry is going to solve the mystery, he needs to act fast before the new snakes suffer the same misfortune.

00:49.859 --> 00:51.462
It's time for a visit to Oman.

00:56.406 --> 00:57.213
Hello, Mr. Sulaimani.

00:57.384 --> 00:58.799
Welcome to Oman. How are you?

00:59.300 --> 00:59.979
I'm doing good.

01:00.531 --> 01:07.109
Sheikh Amir Al Sulaimani loved the idea of financing a snake park to educate the people of his country about wildlife,...

01:08.649 --> 01:13.256
...but he didn't fully appreciate how difficult it would be to create a reptile reserve in the desert.

01:14.023 --> 01:14.344
How are you?

01:14.644 --> 01:15.023
Oh, I'm good.

01:15.759 --> 01:19.909
The snake park originally housed over 140 snakes from all around the world,...

01:21.603 --> 01:24.975
...but after just a few months only one snake is still alive.

01:25.129 --> 01:26.298
This one is beautiful.

01:26.888 --> 01:27.660
What do you think of this guy?

01:27.964 --> 01:29.831
Oh it's lovely, it's an albino python.

01:30.509 --> 01:32.189
While the sheikh finances the project,...

01:32.422 --> 01:36.487
...it's Muhammad Al Harthy, the general manager of the park, who handles the snakes.

01:36.976 --> 01:39.621
From when I was four years old, I would start playing with a snake.

01:39.713 --> 01:42.352
Even in school, people used to call me "snake".

01:43.005 --> 01:45.323
It's been my favorite business since I was young.

01:46.923 --> 01:51.684
Muhammad hired two so-called snake experts from Southeast Asia to help set up the park,...

01:52.658 --> 01:54.925
...but they weren't what they appeared to be at all.

01:55.797 --> 01:58.273
Everything they did was wrong, it was painfully wrong.

01:58.866 --> 02:02.931
They used to grab the snakes with nooses, stuffed food down their throats,...

02:03.177 --> 02:05.772
...everything that you could possibly do if you wanted to kill a snake.

02:06.546 --> 02:11.509
After questioning the witnesses, Gerry's next priority is to inspect the scene of the crime.

02:11.905 --> 02:15.645
Clue number one is the extremely hot sun and the heat in the desert.

02:15.813 --> 02:20.888
106 degrees. That's way too much, no snake will live in that.

02:21.358 --> 02:25.153
Clue number two is found in the glass enclosures where the snakes lived.

02:25.919 --> 02:31.091
Okay, to start with, you never want any electric wiring anywhere here.

02:31.427 --> 02:33.667
It's just too dangerous for snakes.

02:35.347 --> 02:39.633
Clue number three lies just beneath Gerry's feet as he inspects the units.

02:41.473 --> 02:45.878
Sand is way too fine, it's like dust and that's not good.

02:46.030 --> 02:48.297
Infections will just swell out of it.

02:48.672 --> 02:51.892
It's no surprise that the snakes didn't make it in this environment.

02:52.581 --> 02:56.943
Speaking with the park staff and looking at these enclosures,...

02:57.139 --> 03:01.557
...enclosures played a big role in the cause of death of all the snakes here.

03:02.797 --> 03:05.844
So, we're gonna have to change this and then change the way they've been dealing with the snakes...

03:05.949 --> 03:06.889
...because they were taught wrong.

03:07.386 --> 03:09.117
And that should be fine.

03:09.187 --> 03:11.760
We can get new snakes and keep them happy and alive.
