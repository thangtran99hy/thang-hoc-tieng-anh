00:00.149 --> 00:02.843
It's a common practice in business and social circles,...

00:03.177 --> 00:05.360
...but what does your handshake really say about you?

00:05.874 --> 00:10.310
I got a firm grip on the issue when I met up with personal image consultant Kimberly Law.

00:14.714 --> 00:15.717
Kimberly, nice to meet you.

00:15.779 --> 00:16.502
Nice to meet you.

00:16.948 --> 00:18.894
Now, I have to say my hands may have been a bit sweaty...

00:18.982 --> 00:20.730
...because I know we're talking about handshakes here.

00:20.797 --> 00:21.983
So what did you think of my handshake?

00:22.101 --> 00:23.249
I think your handshake was great.

00:23.384 --> 00:28.625
A really good handshake is when you hold hands web to web, you lean into the handshake.

00:28.731 --> 00:29.683
Web being this part here?

00:29.774 --> 00:30.715
Web being this part here.

00:30.788 --> 00:31.575
So right in there.

00:31.638 --> 00:32.111
Right in there.

00:32.165 --> 00:32.289
Okay.

00:33.111 --> 00:35.586
Good, solid, firm handshake. Good eye contact.

00:35.722 --> 00:37.309
Smiling, which is really important.

00:37.429 --> 00:37.702
Aha.

00:37.799 --> 00:39.449
And two to three pumps is great.

00:39.687 --> 00:40.501
One, two, three.

00:40.782 --> 00:41.217
Exactly.

00:41.345 --> 00:41.772
Okay.

00:41.936 --> 00:44.227
So how important would you say a handshake is?

00:44.465 --> 00:47.143
And what would be the consequences of a poor handshake?

00:47.293 --> 00:49.699
I think a poor handshake can actually cost a lot,...

00:49.803 --> 00:52.792
...because the person that you're shaking hands with...

00:52.871 --> 00:56.334
...is going to have a perception of you based on your handshake.

00:56.758 --> 00:58.122
And if it's a really weak handshake,...

00:58.279 --> 01:03.345
...they're going to perceive you as a very wishy-washy person, maybe not very confident.

01:03.463 --> 01:05.221
Somebody who maybe can't handle the job.

01:05.542 --> 01:07.199
If it is an overly aggressive handshake,...

01:07.492 --> 01:09.795
...the person may have the exact opposite reaction and they may think,...

01:09.875 --> 01:12.505
... "Oh gee, this person is really overly aggressive."

01:12.598 --> 01:15.293
"And I don't know if this is the kind of person I really wanna work with."

01:15.487 --> 01:17.095
So it can definitely have an effect.

01:17.292 --> 01:19.770
Now, give me an example of a poor handshake.

01:20.106 --> 01:22.783
Some people have no idea of how hard their handshake is...

01:22.878 --> 01:25.538
...and they really shake the heck out of the other person's hand.

01:25.606 --> 01:30.279
And they also have a very powerful bone crushing grip.

01:30.367 --> 01:30.818
Exactly!

01:30.886 --> 01:31.145
Yeah.
