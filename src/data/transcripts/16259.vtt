00:00.031 --> 00:00.589
Good morning.

00:01.436 --> 00:05.832
As you know, this process involves you giving a one minute presentation about yourself...

00:05.971 --> 00:07.287
...and why you'd like this job.

00:07.943 --> 00:10.597
We'll then have a short break before the formal interview starts.

00:11.541 --> 00:11.877
Okay.

00:12.589 --> 00:14.381
Please begin whenever you're ready.

00:18.714 --> 00:19.289
Good morning.

00:20.855 --> 00:24.371
I'd like to take this opportunity to say how delighted I am to be here.

00:24.909 --> 00:29.853
And how glad I am to have an opportunity to tell you a little bit more about myself,...

00:30.385 --> 00:31.989
...and why I'm the right person for you.

00:32.937 --> 00:38.469
As you can see from my CV, I got my first degree nearly ten years ago.

00:39.063 --> 00:42.495
And last year I completed my postgraduate degree.

00:43.827 --> 00:46.158
I think I benefited a lot from the formal training.

00:47.341 --> 00:51.637
In the last six years, I've worked for two companies but in similar roles.

00:51.783 --> 00:54.305
Starting off with the South Beach Council...

00:54.755 --> 00:57.849
...where I managed a team of ten, which was very interesting.

00:58.547 --> 01:01.183
My most recent position was at the Technical Cove...

01:01.431 --> 01:04.420
...where I was Chief Engineer, managing a team of twenty.

01:05.229 --> 01:07.330
Moving on to why I want this job.

01:08.242 --> 01:12.897
I'm an experienced engineer. I'm a good people person.

01:13.304 --> 01:15.423
I have good communication skills.

01:15.851 --> 01:18.342
I'm comfortable presenting to clients.

01:19.115 --> 01:21.450
I want to work for your company for many reasons.

01:22.039 --> 01:25.283
You are clearly a very ambitious company.

01:26.156 --> 01:29.926
And your success over the past few years has been very impressive.

01:30.350 --> 01:32.935
And your reputation is the envy of the industry.

01:33.603 --> 01:41.997
If I was appointed, I would start by getting to know your team and seeing what they do.

01:42.836 --> 01:46.206
I would then evaluate the key processes...

01:47.167 --> 01:50.983
...and see if I had any suggestions for improvements.

01:52.106 --> 01:52.597
Thank you.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.508
Thank you for your presentation.

01:56.071 --> 01:58.375
You can have a short break now before your interview begins.
