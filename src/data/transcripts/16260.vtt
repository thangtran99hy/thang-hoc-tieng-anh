00:00.724 --> 00:03.563
Even before Hollywood's big hit dinosaur movies,...

00:03.631 --> 00:07.359
...museum dinosaur displays fascinated children and adults alike.

00:07.663 --> 00:10.878
However, few likely consider who makes these amazing creations.

00:11.239 --> 00:15.045
Canadian craftsman Peter May's workshop near Niagara Falls, Ontario...

00:15.253 --> 00:17.520
...seems a bit like a dinosaur construction site.

00:17.654 --> 00:23.296
It's a work in progress on a stegosaurus and we have put the plates on...

00:23.383 --> 00:25.537
...and reconstructed the backbone.

00:25.643 --> 00:29.597
This one is pretty straightforward, it's your old standard dinosaur.

00:30.253 --> 00:32.600
Straightforward only if you're Peter May,...

00:32.799 --> 00:35.785
...but that's because he's one of the world's best at this craft.

00:36.406 --> 00:38.849
This came right out of the blue, it's just growing.

00:39.035 --> 00:43.461
I don't think anybody could sit down in their late teens and say, "I'm going to be a dinosaur builder."

00:43.795 --> 00:49.007
May began his career working at Toronto's Royal Ontario Museum in the early 1980s.

00:49.189 --> 00:54.227
However, many of the museums around the globe could no longer afford to keep experts like May on staff,...

00:54.431 --> 00:57.322
...so the dinosaur builder found a job more suited for him.

00:57.513 --> 01:02.369
Instead of limiting himself to one museum, he started hiring himself out as a freelancer.

01:02.555 --> 01:08.115
So, he found that if he freelanced, the museums of the world could come to him when they needed him,...

01:08.200 --> 01:08.993
...and that is what's happening.

01:09.084 --> 01:12.305
He has jobs in Europe and in Japan, and all around the world.

01:12.451 --> 01:14.499
Most people believe he is the best.

01:14.696 --> 01:20.205
It's rare for May's company, Research Casting International, to mount actual dinosaur bones.

01:20.323 --> 01:24.645
Most of their work is in making casts of real bones to create artificial ones.

01:24.961 --> 01:27.979
The process begins with painting the actual bone with rubber...

01:28.262 --> 01:29.953
...to recreate its feel and shape.

01:30.274 --> 01:33.607
Next, they wrap the cast shape in a hard covering for support...

01:33.859 --> 01:35.710
...and pour in a fiberglass compound.

01:35.956 --> 01:40.198
The finished product is an artificial bone that is identical in shape to the real one.

01:40.539 --> 01:44.026
These artificial bones are cheaper and lighter than actual fossils,...

01:44.303 --> 01:45.924
...and holes can be drilled into them...

01:46.042 --> 01:49.279
...so the skeletons can be assembled on a simple supporting structure,...

01:49.568 --> 01:50.871
...thus making them more stable.

01:52.204 --> 01:54.821
Most of the skeletons, however, are incomplete.

01:54.964 --> 01:58.575
The builders must shape the missing pieces to recreate parts of animals...

01:58.659 --> 02:00.479
...that have been extinct for millions of years.

02:00.780 --> 02:05.456
There aren't many courses about mounting dinosaurs, May's team must learn on the job.

02:05.619 --> 02:08.986
Some started their careers in another trade and transfer their skills.

02:09.241 --> 02:10.949
Garth Dallman was a blacksmith.

02:11.576 --> 02:14.809
It's a good blend of science and art.

02:16.408 --> 02:21.359
My skills are actually, I guess they're coming back in a lot of ways.

02:21.444 --> 02:23.080
Some people are wanting decorative iron work,...

02:23.193 --> 02:26.837
...but the actual trade of blacksmithing is a bit of a dinosaur, too.

02:28.049 --> 02:31.417
Putting a skeleton together is a natural version of a construction project.

02:31.767 --> 02:36.695
The unfortunate aspect of this puzzle is that if just one piece of the skeleton is placed incorrectly,...

02:36.782 --> 02:38.583
...the entire structure could be thrown off.

02:38.849 --> 02:41.659
And if you don't start with the leg in the right way then the hip will be wrong,...

02:42.047 --> 02:43.376
...and then the backbone will be wrong.

02:43.505 --> 02:46.188
So, you really have to know what you're doing from the beginning on,...

02:46.539 --> 02:48.273
...so that everything works properly.

02:48.376 --> 02:50.188
I mean, it's like a puzzle. You can't put one piece,...

02:50.585 --> 02:52.988
...one piece in wrong and expect everything else would fit.

02:54.867 --> 02:58.750
The builders in May's workshop also help scientists solve the mysteries...

02:58.861 --> 03:01.608
...surrounding these ancient reptiles that roamed the earth.

03:02.951 --> 03:09.626
They are in the fore of the controversies of how these animals lived and acted,...

03:09.746 --> 03:13.397
...because how you put them together, what kind of posture you put them in,...

03:15.042 --> 03:17.661
...really is the way they are interpreted.

03:18.360 --> 03:21.235
A paleontologist might say, "Well, we believe it's done this way,"...

03:21.326 --> 03:23.023
...and the guy who's mounting it could say,...

03:23.097 --> 03:25.531
..."Well, I don't think the bones go together that way, look!"

03:25.896 --> 03:30.459
You know? And so, there is this conversation back and forth that's quite valuable.

03:31.087 --> 03:36.003
And there's a very big difference between an average mount and a fantastic mount.

03:36.521 --> 03:39.585
A really beautifully posed mount is a work of art.

03:39.991 --> 03:42.957
Dinosaur builders are the public face of paleontology.

03:43.209 --> 03:46.338
They provide the big show that follows the hard work in the field,...

03:46.499 --> 03:48.872
...and the responsibility really means something to them.

03:49.189 --> 03:51.950
It's like anything that becomes a labor of love.

03:52.469 --> 03:53.747
These guys were king of the hill back then.

03:54.976 --> 03:56.665
 As you work on it, your mind drifts.

03:56.758 --> 04:00.115
And when it's mounted and it's on display in the museum,...

04:00.214 --> 04:03.832
...the one skeleton becomes part of a whole, which is the history of our world.
