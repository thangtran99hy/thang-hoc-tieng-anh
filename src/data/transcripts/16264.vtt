00:01.573 --> 00:04.593
While in planetary orbit, the view of the Earth looks calm,...

00:04.777 --> 00:08.167
...but the vacuum of space is a hostile environment lacking oxygen...

00:08.275 --> 00:11.675
...and filled with radiation, which can be harmful in large amounts.

00:13.695 --> 00:15.451
Although humans can't survive in it,...

00:15.636 --> 00:20.497
...people have been exploring the frontier of space since the manned space flights of the 1960s.

00:22.296 --> 00:25.510
A number of astronauts have achieved this with the help of spaceships,...

00:25.705 --> 00:30.313
...space suits and other scientific inventions to help them endure the challenges.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.343
In order for astronauts to survive in space,...

00:36.515 --> 00:39.663
...space suits must provide them with a self-contained environment.

00:40.997 --> 00:43.694
The suit's tough material and heating and cooling elements...

00:43.899 --> 00:46.138
...protect astronauts from extreme temperatures,...

00:46.423 --> 00:51.361
...which can range from around 121 degrees Celsius to minus 157.

00:54.580 --> 00:57.913
The suits are also pressurized, allowing astronauts to breathe...

00:58.020 --> 01:00.753
...and keeping their blood from boiling in the vacuum of space.

01:03.134 --> 01:05.360
The first daring steps outside the spacecraft...

01:05.479 --> 01:10.260
...were made by Soviet astronaut Aleksei Leonov on March 18th 1965.

01:10.911 --> 01:13.508
He was outside the spacecraft for 12 minutes.

01:15.495 --> 01:17.402
This achievement was repeated months later...

01:17.480 --> 01:20.990
...by American astronaut Edward White during the Gemini 4 Mission,...

01:21.179 --> 01:24.546
...which first launched into space on June 3rd 1965.

01:25.053 --> 01:28.398
On that same day, White became the first American to spacewalk,...

01:28.495 --> 01:32.617
...staying outside of the safety of the spacecraft for a total of 23 minutes.

01:34.389 --> 01:36.380
Although these short trips were only intended...

01:36.467 --> 01:40.080
... to test the possibility of humans existing outside of spacecrafts,...

01:40.202 --> 01:44.457
...spacewalks have become a relatively common part of missions in the space shuttle era.

01:47.503 --> 01:51.065
On spacewalks, astronauts are able to perform crucial tasks...

01:51.149 --> 01:53.507
...that could not be accomplished from inside the shuttle.

01:54.157 --> 01:57.974
They've been able to recover lost satellites and restore them to their proper orbit.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.975
They've serviced and repaired orbiting bodies...

02:01.086 --> 02:04.188
...like replacing the solar panels on the Hubble Space Telescope,...

02:04.603 --> 02:07.961
...and they've become the construction team for the International Space Station,...

02:08.175 --> 02:11.226
..a research facility currently being put together in space.

02:12.421 --> 02:15.129
Conducting spacewalks is not without challenges.

02:15.459 --> 02:18.871
There's the constant danger of floating away due to the lack of gravity,...

02:19.099 --> 02:23.125
...so astronauts work in pairs, tied to the spacecraft for safety.

02:23.655 --> 02:26.621
Working in space suits is not as easy as one might think,...

02:26.875 --> 02:30.140
...and the thick, pressurized gloves make holding tools difficult.

02:32.216 --> 02:36.879
To ensure spacewalk missions are successful, astronauts practice their planned walks.

02:37.766 --> 02:39.835
They do so, in a large water filled tank,...

02:39.927 --> 02:43.970
...to test the physiological effects of living in a weightless environment such as space.

02:44.674 --> 02:48.275
While immersed in the water, the astronauts neither sink nor float,...

02:48.542 --> 02:50.704
...creating a sensation close to weightlessness.

02:51.533 --> 02:53.770
For every hour of task scheduled on a mission,...

02:53.993 --> 02:56.431
...up to ten hours are spent practicing underwater.

02:58.177 --> 03:01.127
As NASA moves forward on the International Space Station,...

03:01.313 --> 03:04.346
...spacewalks will continue to be essential to the process.

03:04.663 --> 03:07.540
The project, which began construction in 1998,...

03:07.669 --> 03:11.344
...has a projected operations date through at least 2016.

03:11.569 --> 03:16.458
By that time, workers will have completed the station and it will likely be totally operational.

03:16.688 --> 03:20.897
It looks like there will be plenty to keep the spacewalkers busy over the next few years.
