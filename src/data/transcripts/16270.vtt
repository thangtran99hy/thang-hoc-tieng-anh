00:00.545 --> 00:06.317
The human body: no machine can match the impressive actions it performs every day.

00:07.937 --> 00:12.238
Our lungs take in 66 liters of air each minute when we exercise.

00:13.096 --> 00:17.423
Our hearts pump more than 7,570 liters of blood each day,...

00:17.987 --> 00:22.218
...and it takes more than 600 muscles to keep us moving in every direction.

00:23.206 --> 00:26.515
Cells are the smallest level of the body's organization.

00:26.757 --> 00:29.653
Human beings are made up of over 100 trillion of them.

00:29.936 --> 00:33.863
Individual cells are arranged into tissues, like this heart tissue.

00:34.175 --> 00:37.989
Different kinds of tissue come together to form organs such as the heart,...

00:38.149 --> 00:39.431
...the lungs, and the stomach.

00:40.207 --> 00:43.493
Several organs working together create an organ system.

00:43.669 --> 00:48.191
There are ten major organ systems in the human body, including the circulatory system,...

00:48.342 --> 00:53.083
...the respiratory system, the digestive system, the nervous system, and the reproductive system.

00:53.195 --> 00:55.105
Each performs a special job.

00:55.671 --> 01:00.245
The circulatory and respiratory systems supply energy to the body 24 hours a day.

01:00.568 --> 01:03.378
The heart is the major organ of the circulatory system.

01:03.597 --> 01:07.044
This powerful little organ works incredibly hard and completely automatically.

01:07.367 --> 01:13.707
No other muscle in the body is as strong. It beats 100,000 times a day, 36 million times a year,...

01:13.923 --> 01:17.196
...pumping the blood on a complete trip around the body in less than a minute.

01:18.670 --> 01:22.136
In the respiratory system, the lungs pull in oxygen from the air,...

01:22.278 --> 01:26.089
...delivering breath through more than 24 hundred kilometers of airways.

01:27.691 --> 01:31.794
The body gets its energy from food, turning pizza into molecules...

01:31.886 --> 01:35.628
...that can be absorbed throughout the body is the job of the digestive system.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.751
Digestion begins in the mouth.

01:37.994 --> 01:42.385
The act of swallowing sends food down the esophagus or throat into the stomach.

01:42.875 --> 01:45.516
Then like a food mixer, the stomach contracts...

01:45.611 --> 01:48.933
...to break this nourishment down, helped by acid and enzymes.

01:49.151 --> 01:52.971
These nutrients, which are now liquid then travel into the small intestine,...

01:53.105 --> 01:56.993
...which can be over six meters long where most nutrients enter the blood stream.

01:59.757 --> 02:02.133
The brain is the nerve center of the body.

02:02.574 --> 02:04.051
About the size of a grapefruit,...

02:04.231 --> 02:08.089
...this small, strange looking organ is the most complex object on Earth.

02:08.961 --> 02:11.602
It contains up to 100 billion nerve cells...

02:11.689 --> 02:15.933
...that transmit signals through the brain at over 320 kilometers an hour.

02:18.375 --> 02:22.481
The brain, spinal cord and nerves make up the central nervous system,...

02:22.653 --> 02:25.550
...which all work together to control the body's activities.

02:27.921 --> 02:30.563
The reproductive system creates new life.

02:30.919 --> 02:34.063
Each human being begins as two single cells.

02:34.636 --> 02:37.147
A cell from the mother and another cell from the father.

02:38.769 --> 02:41.409
When these two cells meet, they begin to divide...

02:42.066 --> 02:46.350
...and over nine months, a whole new entity is born: a baby.

02:47.407 --> 02:51.557
Strands of DNA from the original two cells act like a set of blueprints,...

02:51.704 --> 02:53.405
...telling the new cells what to do.

02:53.703 --> 02:58.512
DNA establishes the color of the baby's eyes whether its hair is curly or straight,...

02:58.697 --> 03:00.124
...even the size of its smile.

03:01.123 --> 03:05.099
The end result of all of these corresponding systems and processes...

03:05.214 --> 03:09.628
...is a human body that is able to take us on an extraordinary journey every day.

03:09.779 --> 03:12.964
It allows us to push frontiers, meet remarkable challenges,...

03:13.087 --> 03:15.032
...and expand the limits of human achievement.

03:15.211 --> 03:18.499
And it all starts at the level of a single little cell.
