If you want to visit a place that would be featured in a magazine like National Geographic,...

00:07.845 --> 00:10.170
...you should not miss this place in Turkey.

00:11.118 --> 00:15.311
You would be overwhelmed by the breathtaking scenery of Pamukkale,...

00:15.567 --> 00:18.107
...which means "cotton castle" in Turkish.

00:18.787 --> 00:22.259
This is a tranquil place where you could meditate in silence.

00:22.719 --> 00:24.579
When you arrive at this hot spot,...

00:24.789 --> 00:30.146
...you will observe a 100-meter-high rock platform covered in pools and terraces...

00:30.407 --> 00:32.845
...that bring to mind a frozen waterfall.

00:33.656 --> 00:39.064
Water from the hot springs gathers in pools that fill up and overflow into smaller pools,...

00:39.421 --> 00:44.296
...splashing happily as it cascades down among bushes of oleander.

00:45.299 --> 00:51.652
In colder weather, the flowing water creates mists above the pools, which adds a special magic.

00:52.270 --> 00:56.351
Throughout the year, you can bathe in around 33 degrees Celsius...

00:56.579 --> 01:02.037
...in open-air swimming pools at hotels and motels, as well as on the terraces.

01:02.521 --> 01:05.411
This place would give you unforgettable moments.
