A newcomer on the tourism scene is no doubt Rwanda,...

00:06.379 --> 00:09.703
...which most people still connect with genocide and atrocities...

00:09.768 --> 00:11.531
...committed during the last civil war.

00:12.340 --> 00:14.385
However, Rwanda has changed.

00:15.052 --> 00:18.251
This small but charming country has many attractions.

00:19.256 --> 00:23.319
One of them is gorilla trekking in the Parc National de Volcans.

00:24.173 --> 00:25.903
Trekking is physically demanding...

00:25.971 --> 00:28.519
...because it entails a fair amount of hours...

00:28.616 --> 00:30.519
...walking through the forest with guides.

00:31.604 --> 00:35.299
As you wind your way through hanging vines and moss-covered trees,...

00:35.895 --> 00:38.757
...you may see golden monkeys, buffaloes and birds.

00:39.777 --> 00:43.446
The highlight is time spent with the gentle giant gorillas.

00:44.378 --> 00:47.315
Watching them care for their young is very moving.

00:48.282 --> 00:51.503
The famous gorilla research pioneer, Dian Fossey,...

00:51.881 --> 00:55.533
...whose life was filmed in the Hollywood movie, Gorillas in the Mist,...

00:56.013 --> 00:59.797
...was buried here after poachers murdered her in 1985.

01:00.729 --> 01:02.077
At the end of your visit,...

01:02.237 --> 01:06.164
...you will understand why she lived in this forest for 18 years...

01:06.287 --> 01:08.317
...among these fantastic animals.
