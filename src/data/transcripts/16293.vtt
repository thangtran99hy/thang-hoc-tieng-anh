You have probably heard of the beauty of Ha Long Bay in Vietnam or at least seen a picture...

00:07.407 --> 00:10.715
...where the magic meeting of land and sea may have impressed you.

00:11.581 --> 00:15.434
It has been attracting more visitors since its UNESCO recognition.

00:16.476 --> 00:18.189
Do you wonder what Ha Long means?

00:18.941 --> 00:22.584
It can be translated into "Bay of Descending Dragons."

00:23.582 --> 00:27.824
You might take a picture of a possibly dragon-shaped rock formation there.

00:28.777 --> 00:31.473
The area is home to many fishing communities...

00:31.541 --> 00:35.863
...who live on floating houses and boats, which give it a vibrant energy.

00:36.719 --> 00:41.097
The bay is sprinkled with a dense cluster of almost 2,000 limestone...

00:41.415 --> 00:44.790
...monolithic islands topped with thick jungle vegetation...

00:45.200 --> 00:48.262
...that rise out of the ocean in a most spectacular way.

00:49.118 --> 00:52.911
Some of the islands are actually hollow and contain huge caves.

00:53.703 --> 00:57.799
French tourists called the largest one "Grotte des Merveilles."

00:58.461 --> 01:05.275
It has three large chambers full of stalactites and stalagmites, plus 19th century French graffiti.

01:05.810 --> 01:06.863
Isn't that interesting?
