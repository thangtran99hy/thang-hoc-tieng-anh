Have you ever heard of Namibia?

00:04.365 --> 00:11.469
It is officially the Republic of Namibia, which is located in southwest Africa on the Atlantic Ocean.

00:12.241 --> 00:17.372
If you are looking for a vacation with a difference, Namibia could be the right place.

00:18.111 --> 00:22.832
Unlike other countries where visitors have to travel by vehicles or on foot,...

00:23.313 --> 00:29.067
...Namibia invites visitors to experience the wide expanses of the country from the air.

00:29.885 --> 00:35.055
Because of the great distances and lacking infrastructure, airplanes are like taxis,...

00:35.350 --> 00:39.255
...and airports are the lifelines that connect all the remote places.

00:39.909 --> 00:45.196
Indeed, the bizarre and magnificent nature is best appreciated from above.

00:45.939 --> 00:51.019
There are many scenic trips, locally called Flying Safaris or DuneHoppers.

00:51.623 --> 00:58.243
For example, you can fly south from Swakopmund over the empty coastline and high sand dunes,...

00:58.579 --> 01:04.301
...where you will come across well-preserved shipwrecks stranded during the German colonial period.

01:05.327 --> 01:12.973
You can see large seal colonies, swarms of flamingos, thousands of cormorants and abandoned diamond settlements.
