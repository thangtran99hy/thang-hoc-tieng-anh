Spain is famous for flamenco, the Pamplona bull running and bull fighting,...

00:06.762 --> 00:12.147
...but what may be less known is that the world's biggest food fight is held in BuÃ±ol,...

00:12.444 --> 00:16.036
...near Valencia, on the last Wednesday of every August.

00:16.768 --> 00:24.851
30,000 people attend the festival called "Tomatina" to throw about 250,000 pounds of tomatoes at each other.

00:25.597 --> 00:28.809
To start with, there is a ham on a stick competition.

00:29.396 --> 00:34.063
Contestants climb a pole and bring back a smoked leg of ham stuck on it.

00:34.642 --> 00:37.872
After this, people put on some eye protection...

00:37.954 --> 00:42.324
...and big trucks deliver masses of tomatoes and dump them on the street.

00:42.829 --> 00:47.271
People bombard each other with the tomatoes until all of them have been thrown.

00:47.963 --> 00:50.936
This tradition goes back to 1945...

00:51.143 --> 00:56.109
...when two young men got into an argument  and started to fight each other during a carnival,...

00:56.391 --> 01:00.549
...throwing tomatoes from a nearby vegetable stall among other things.

01:01.207 --> 01:05.104
Since then, the "Tomatina" has become an annual tradition.
