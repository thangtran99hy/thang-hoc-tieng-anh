00:02.135 --> 00:05.296
One of the least traveled countries is Mauritania.

00:05.943 --> 00:10.082
This is not a place to visit if you are hung up on comfort and luxury,...

00:10.839 --> 00:15.346
...but "roughing it" can have its own special charm, adding a sense of adventure.

00:16.352 --> 00:19.407
Mauritania's best hidden secret is Ben Amera.

00:20.011 --> 00:23.567
Mass tourism has not yet discovered this enormous rock,...

00:24.128 --> 00:26.597
...which lies obscure in the middle of the desert.

00:27.436 --> 00:30.129
Other monoliths like Aicha are close by.

00:30.784 --> 00:32.827
You can kill two birds with one stone...

00:32.895 --> 00:36.508
...by traveling to Ben Amera on the world's longest train.

00:37.386 --> 00:42.280
The monolith is about 5 kilometers from the small village of Tmeimichatt...

00:42.795 --> 00:46.750
...on the desert train route between Nouadhibou and Zouerate.

00:47.661 --> 00:52.970
But don't expect any conveniences or amenities because the train is in a shabby condition.

00:53.852 --> 00:57.723
However, if you are not fazed by delays and inconveniences,...

00:58.085 --> 01:01.920
...and you enjoy an environment with some breathtaking desert sceneries,...

01:02.321 --> 01:03.915
...this place will be for you.

01:04.285 --> 01:06.405
You will never forget this experience!
