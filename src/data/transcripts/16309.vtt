Lake Champlain in the US states of Vermont and New York...

00:06.960 --> 00:11.023
...is a place of many cultural heritage sites and tourist attractions.

00:11.773 --> 00:15.573
You can go fishing and trekking, or check out the Maritime Museum.

00:16.494 --> 00:20.953
But a really special event on offer is exploring underwater shipwrecks.

00:21.663 --> 00:26.255
In fact, the lake has been established as an underwater historic preserve.

00:27.192 --> 00:34.071
Some of the nearly 200-year-old wrecks include steamboats, canal boats, ferries and sailing boats.

00:34.908 --> 00:41.258
Free of charge registration from a dive shop, the museum, or online is required for all dives.

00:42.138 --> 00:48.443
Strict rules and diving suggestions are given in order to protect the fragile and irreplaceable environment.

00:49.202 --> 00:52.631
Snorkeling and diving will add a totally new perspective,...

00:53.079 --> 00:55.317
...so you had better not miss the chance!

00:56.061 --> 00:58.716
And why not try to find something underwater...

00:59.053 --> 01:04.113
...while snorkeling because the lake is said to have its own Loch Ness-like monster called Champ?

01:04.971 --> 01:07.001
What an adventure diving can be!
