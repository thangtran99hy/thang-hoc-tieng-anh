Shopping is usually something that women enjoy,...

00:04.610 --> 00:07.277
...but in Dubai, part of the United Arab Emirates,...

00:07.655 --> 00:08.837
...things are different.

00:09.460 --> 00:15.337
Children and men would also be enticed by shopping malls where fantasy is running wild.

00:16.075 --> 00:18.874
Prices are actually no cheaper than anywhere else,...

00:19.311 --> 00:22.114
...but what is captivating about shopping in Dubai...

00:22.465 --> 00:25.555
...is that you feel as if you are in an amusement park.

00:26.335 --> 00:30.379
For example, the Madinat Jumeirah has a waterway...

00:30.452 --> 00:35.946
...that transports people from its shops, bars and restaurants to the nearby hotels.

00:36.699 --> 00:41.756
The massive Mall of the Emirates has an indoor ski slope with real snow.

00:42.585 --> 00:44.051
Isn't this amazing?

00:44.661 --> 00:46.015
But this is not all.

00:46.664 --> 00:50.391
"Dubai Shopping Festival" is held in the first quarter of each year,...

00:50.697 --> 00:53.198
...and there are huge discounts on merchandise.

00:53.900 --> 00:58.905
If you are hungry after shopping, you can either experience five-star cuisine...

00:59.067 --> 01:03.311
...at the Grosvenor and Hilton or go to Al Dhiyafah Road,...

01:03.730 --> 01:07.143
...where there are cheap restaurants like the Ravi Restaurant.
