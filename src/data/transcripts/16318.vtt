If you are into very simple but delicious food,...

00:04.139 --> 00:08.807
...and if you don't need any fancy ingredients and culinary extravagance,...

00:09.369 --> 00:13.408
...a visit to Vis, one of the Croatian islands, might be it.

00:14.278 --> 00:18.860
With traditional cuisine, tiny restaurants and a "life in the slow lane" motto,...

00:19.346 --> 00:23.224
...this island has established a modest corner on the tourist market.

00:24.069 --> 00:27.490
The seasons, the weather and the endless blue ocean...

00:27.593 --> 00:29.037
...characterize the lifestyle.

00:30.066 --> 00:32.210
The main ingredients of the local cuisine are...

00:32.326 --> 00:35.559
...blue fish and vegetables, salted sardines...

00:35.862 --> 00:37.970
...and grilled fresh sardines on a spit.

00:38.708 --> 00:41.546
The idea is to have as little waste as possible.

00:42.435 --> 00:44.096
Vegetables are cooked and bottled,...

00:44.547 --> 00:47.509
...and fruits are made into jam or spiced and dried.

00:48.331 --> 00:50.329
Fish stock is used for bean stew.

00:51.167 --> 00:52.467
The dishes are delicious...

00:52.573 --> 00:56.076
...because of this plainness and excellence of the raw materials.

00:57.150 --> 01:00.767
The effort the local people expend on nurturing their fields...

01:00.870 --> 01:04.853
...as well as on the cooking process makes the food exceptional.
