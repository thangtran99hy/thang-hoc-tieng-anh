00:01.115 --> 00:04.499
Eating in Ethiopia is a special experience.

00:05.014 --> 00:09.102
You sit on low comfortable divans covered with monkey fur.

00:09.836 --> 00:15.135
The server appears with a pitcher, a copper basin and towels to clean your hands.

00:15.747 --> 00:20.356
A wicker table with a domed cover is brought, and when the cover is taken off,...

00:20.601 --> 00:24.408
...you see a gray tablecloth overlapping the edges of the table.

00:24.996 --> 00:27.343
When the food is poured onto the tablecloth,...

00:27.631 --> 00:31.181
...you realize that it's not a tablecloth after all.

00:31.850 --> 00:38.176
It's the "Injera," the sourdough Ethiopian bread that looks like a great big pancake.

00:38.825 --> 00:43.958
You tear off a piece of bread with ingredients on it and roll it up like a cigar.

00:44.601 --> 00:48.290
A polite gesture is to stick the roll into another person's mouth.

00:48.907 --> 00:52.505
The idea is not to take the best bits for yourself.

00:53.197 --> 00:57.437
The dishes could be peppery stews like chicken or lamb wat,...

00:57.861 --> 01:00.427
...lab cottage cheese and yogurt.

01:00.901 --> 01:03.373
The dessert may be raw ground beef.
