00:02.475 --> 00:07.395
Can you believe that there is a 217-kilometer-long train track...

00:07.557 --> 00:10.569
...at a height of 4,000 meters above the sea?

00:11.296 --> 00:15.791
Let's go to Salta Railway Station in the Northeast of Argentina.

00:16.596 --> 00:19.493
This could surely be a once in a lifetime ride.

00:20.193 --> 00:25.217
This trip will take you to the desert and the remote Chilean town of Socompa.

00:25.818 --> 00:26.926
Just imagine!

00:27.243 --> 00:33.000
After sunset over the desert plains, the night sky will be lit up by many stars...

00:33.373 --> 00:35.922
...and you will probably chat with other travelers.

00:36.682 --> 00:38.281
Here are some tips for you, though.

00:38.717 --> 00:41.181
It is better to wear something really comfortable...

00:41.278 --> 00:44.543
...because you spend more than 16 hours on the train.

00:45.100 --> 00:49.451
The train starts at 7 am and arrives at 11 pm.

00:50.183 --> 00:53.905
In addition, the train ticket only includes a cup of coffee,...

00:54.160 --> 00:57.218
...so it is better to bring your favorite food with you.

00:57.685 --> 01:01.839
Otherwise, you would have to pay for your lunch and dinner on board.
