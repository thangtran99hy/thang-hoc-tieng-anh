If you can take a vacation between December and May,...

00:06.401 --> 00:10.103
...visiting Chile with your friends or family can be a good decision.

00:10.889 --> 00:13.864
Many travelers rave about the beauty of Patagonia...

00:14.307 --> 00:17.917
...and the Iguassu Falls when they think of traveling to South America.

00:18.842 --> 00:22.919
However, now there is another attraction equally magnificent.

00:23.728 --> 00:27.371
A few years ago, in the most southern tip of South America,...

00:27.736 --> 00:32.174
...in the Strait of Magellan, scientists made a great discovery.

00:32.845 --> 00:35.898
They found the summer feeding grounds of humpback whales...

00:36.021 --> 00:38.847
...in the channel around Carlos III Island.

00:39.740 --> 00:43.391
They lobbied the government and finally Chile's first marine park,...

00:43.521 --> 00:47.206
...Marine Park Francisco Coloane, was established.

00:48.005 --> 00:50.424
Many visitors come to watch whales there.

00:51.415 --> 00:54.747
You can also watch dolphins, penguins, birds and seals.

00:55.666 --> 00:59.930
If you can really make it there, don't miss the chance to try kayaking.

01:00.857 --> 01:03.495
This could be your favorite pastime in this region.

01:04.293 --> 01:09.142
Wouldn't it be amazing to take a picture of you kayaking in such a beautiful surrounding?
