What comes to your mind when you think of Australia?

00:06.739 --> 00:08.627
Kangaroos and koalas?

00:09.178 --> 00:12.527
There is one more thing, which is a wonder of nature.

00:13.221 --> 00:20.303
Formerly known as Ayers Rock, Uluru is a natural icon that most people connect with Australia.

00:21.028 --> 00:24.949
Like other famous landmarks such as the Great Pyramid in Egypt,...

00:25.425 --> 00:30.749
...it is placed on a major planetary grid point, which makes it so mysterious.

00:31.475 --> 00:35.966
Uluru is a huge magnetic monolith in the heart of Australia.

00:36.695 --> 00:40.472
This is a sacred part of the aboriginal creation mythology.

00:40.958 --> 00:45.013
That is why the local community wanted to forbid climbing the rock...

00:45.141 --> 00:49.097
...because they believe the path crosses a sacred dream line.

00:49.792 --> 00:54.783
However, if you have the guts to try climbing there, it is possible to do so,...

00:55.288 --> 01:00.477
...but remember that each year several tourists die, mostly from heart failure.

01:01.182 --> 01:03.343
If you are not in the mood of climbing there,...

01:03.594 --> 01:07.901
...just watch how the color of Uluru changes according to the light.
