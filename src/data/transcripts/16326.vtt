00:01.356 --> 00:03.281
Whether you are a Christian or not,...

00:03.535 --> 00:06.893
...visiting the Judean Desert and the Dead Sea in Israel...

00:06.983 --> 00:09.353
...would be a once in a lifetime experience.

00:10.221 --> 00:14.210
The Bible mentions that the Judean Desert was where the Holy Spirit...

00:14.350 --> 00:16.066
...led Jesus into the wilderness.

00:16.903 --> 00:19.065
This place is a harsh landscape...

00:19.526 --> 00:23.611
...where you can experience an austere and inhospitable wilderness.

00:24.501 --> 00:27.421
Floating in the Dead Sea is a photo opportunity...

00:27.712 --> 00:29.591
...and an experience not to be missed.

00:30.385 --> 00:33.402
How about relaxing in the mineral-rich black mud?

00:34.405 --> 00:38.043
Because the Dead Sea is 420 meters below sea level,...

00:38.569 --> 00:41.981
...ultraviolet radiation is low and the sun is safe.

00:42.848 --> 00:45.378
The high concentration of oxygen in the air...

00:45.716 --> 00:49.192
...and the minerals in the water make this a very healthy place, indeed.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.941
In addition, if you want to enjoy...

00:52.030 --> 00:54.891
...the spectacular views of the desert and Dead Sea,...

00:55.109 --> 00:58.114
...there is a cable car to take you up to Herod's Palace.
