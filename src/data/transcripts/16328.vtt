A really great way of exploring Australia is by car,...

00:06.055 --> 00:10.404
...and the southern coast of Western Australia is as good a place as any.

00:11.185 --> 00:15.288
The starting point is the capital city of Western Australia, Perth,...

00:15.575 --> 00:19.117
...no doubt one of the most isolated cities in the world.

00:20.023 --> 00:23.161
The interesting thing is that it is closer to Singapore...

00:23.305 --> 00:25.663
...than it is to the other side of Australia.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.997
Two of the world's great oceans meet here,...

00:29.206 --> 00:31.502
...the Indian and the Pacific Ocean.

00:32.353 --> 00:33.870
This influences the weather,...

00:34.147 --> 00:37.697
...and it is usually cooler here than at the east coast.

00:38.562 --> 00:39.954
The meeting of the two oceans...

00:40.025 --> 00:43.443
...also makes this region a popular spot for surfers.

00:44.339 --> 00:47.015
In addition, during July and November,...

00:47.251 --> 00:49.903
...most areas of the largest Australian state...

00:49.962 --> 00:52.323
...are covered in an inferno of colors,...

00:52.651 --> 00:57.705
...as the wildflowers start to blossom, even up to the doorsteps of Perth.
