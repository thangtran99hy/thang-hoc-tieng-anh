You would agree that it could be interesting...

00:03.647 --> 00:07.621
...to visit the actual place where your favorite movies or books are based.

00:08.371 --> 00:13.043
This time, how about watching the movie "The Beach" starring Leonardo di Caprio?

00:13.978 --> 00:16.037
Then, fly to Phuket in Thailand.

00:16.785 --> 00:22.238
It only takes 45 minutes by speedboat or 90 minutes by ferry from Phuket...

00:22.333 --> 00:25.496
...to reach the picture postcard islands of Phi Phi.

00:26.211 --> 00:30.161
The islands seem to grow out of the sea like a big fortress...

00:30.241 --> 00:31.736
...when you approach them by boat.

00:32.330 --> 00:34.238
You will fall in love with this place...

00:34.348 --> 00:38.190
...because it is the perfect paradise where you can enjoy dream beaches,...

00:38.864 --> 00:42.733
...fantastic rock formations and a multicolored marine life.

00:43.443 --> 00:46.803
Joining cruise day trips to nearby islands is a must.

00:47.545 --> 00:49.105
One of the islands you will visit...

00:49.210 --> 00:53.018
...provided the actual background that was often filmed in the movie,...

00:53.535 --> 00:58.389
...but sadly the island is uninhabited, so you are not allowed to stay there.
