Traveling off the beaten tracks may not be super comfortable and organized,...

00:06.386 --> 00:08.765
...but it also has its advantages.

00:09.773 --> 00:16.266
The small and quiet fishing town of Kodungalloor in the Thrissur District of Kerala in India...

00:16.366 --> 00:19.494
...was once a major port for thousands of years.

00:20.064 --> 00:25.027
Apparently, Judaism, Islam and Christianity all came to India...

00:25.153 --> 00:28.021
...through this port and have left their marks here.

00:28.839 --> 00:32.585
The fascinating temple complexes downtown are worth seeing,...

00:32.885 --> 00:36.405
...especially during the Bharani Festival in late March...

00:36.869 --> 00:41.981
...where the goddess Kannagi is worshipped with songs and chicken sacrifices.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.457
But outside the festival...

00:44.636 --> 00:49.677
...there is also something going on like explosive sounds from the temple square,...

00:50.214 --> 00:54.637
...hijras parading with swords, and older women cutting their forehead...

00:54.743 --> 00:56.797
...to let the blood drip on the altar.

00:57.513 --> 01:01.523
You can also arrange canoe trips into the backwaters with locals.

01:02.251 --> 01:06.389
The best time to visit Kerala is between November and January...

01:06.634 --> 01:09.417
...because it is relatively cool and dry.
