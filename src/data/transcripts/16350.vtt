If you go to Hong Kong, you should not miss the chance to visit Macau.

00:08.535 --> 00:13.625
It is very close to Hong Kong, but you will have a very different atmosphere there.

00:13.886 --> 00:16.684
Because the Portuguese once ruled Macao,...

00:17.053 --> 00:22.823
...you can still find Catholic churches and many historical remains in Portuguese styles.

00:23.639 --> 00:27.738
However, of particular interest is the Venetian these days.

00:28.200 --> 00:33.227
Even if you don't gamble, you will be blown away by this imposing development.

00:33.616 --> 00:35.795
It is absolutely stunning!

00:36.586 --> 00:46.072
The 40-floor luxury hotel tower has 2,900 suites, a 550,000 square foot casino floor,...

00:46.526 --> 00:48.927
...one million square feet of shopping,...

00:49.183 --> 00:54.909
...and a 1,800-seat theater that runs an original Cirque du Soleil production.

00:55.488 --> 01:00.205
Visitors wonder about how it was possible to construct such a colossus.

01:00.741 --> 01:03.787
It is huge, and there are masses to do!

01:04.283 --> 01:09.523
You will be amazed about the effort that must have gone into designing a real Venice...

01:09.625 --> 01:15.147
...with a grand canal, gondolas, and the intricate dome ceiling paintings.
