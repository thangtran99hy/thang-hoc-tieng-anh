It may not be a well-known fact, but New Zealand is increasingly becoming a popular ski and snowboarding destination,...

00:09.184 --> 00:12.715
...especially for heliskiing and heliboarding vacations.

00:13.423 --> 00:18.979
For those of you who are not sure what the 'heli' part stands for, it means off-trail,...

00:19.345 --> 00:25.389
...downhill skiing or boarding that is accessed with a helicopter rather than through a ski lift.

00:26.115 --> 00:30.386
You can ski or snowboard without the effort of having to climb the mountain...

00:30.871 --> 00:37.032
...and it also means that you can ski or board in pristine areas that are otherwise not accessible.

00:37.623 --> 00:39.841
How is that for a unique experience?

00:40.353 --> 00:50.003
Most of the international crowd interested in snow sports travel to the Southern Alps in the Queenstown and Wanaka areas of New Zealand's South Island.
