Michelle and I want to send our best wishes to everyone celebrating the Lunar New Year,...

00:04.696 --> 00:06.890
...including Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders.

00:08.014 --> 00:11.683
You know, growing up in Hawaii, I remember all the excitement surrounding the Lunar New Year;...

00:12.147 --> 00:15.981
...from the parades and the fireworks, to the smaller gatherings with family and friends.

00:16.686 --> 00:19.290
It's always been a time for celebration and for hope.

00:20.042 --> 00:24.044
And this year, as Americans here at home and around the world welcome the Year of the Dragon,...

00:24.588 --> 00:28.129
...it's important to remember that our country is stronger because of our diversity.

00:28.890 --> 00:31.745
We're richer because of the different cultures that make up this country.

00:32.587 --> 00:34.627
So to all those celebrating the Lunar New Year,...

00:34.976 --> 00:38.810
...I wish you and your loved ones peace, prosperity and good health.
