She says you asked her, sir, to enter into an open marriage.

00:08.199 --> 00:09.703
Would you like to take some time to respond to that?

00:10.142 --> 00:11.561
No, but I will.

00:13.267 --> 00:17.449
I think the destructive, vicious, negative nature...

00:18.041 --> 00:21.471
...of much of the news media makes it harder to govern this country,...

00:21.813 --> 00:24.538
...harder to attract decent people to run for public office.

00:24.963 --> 00:30.128
And I am appalled that you would begin a presidential debate on a topic like that.

00:31.177 --> 00:35.088
Back in 1967, your father set a groundbreaking,...

00:35.163 --> 00:38.137
...what was then a groundbreaking standard, in American politics.

00:38.225 --> 00:39.723
He released his tax returns.

00:40.355 --> 00:43.109
He released them for not one year, but for 12 years.

00:43.731 --> 00:45.038
Will you follow your father's example?

00:45.660 --> 00:46.009
Maybe.

00:49.787 --> 00:54.323
Grandiosity has never been a problem with Newt Gingrich; he handles it very, very well.

00:54.812 --> 00:56.771
You're right. I think grandiose thoughts.

00:56.838 --> 01:00.851
This is a grandiose country of big people doing big things.

01:01.065 --> 01:03.827
And we need leadership prepared to take on big projects.

01:04.701 --> 01:08.575
If there's one thing, just one thing in this campaign you could do over, what would it be?

01:08.708 --> 01:11.645
Well, I would have worked to get 25 more votes in Iowa that's for sure.

01:19.830 --> 01:24.563
Why is President Obama for young people being allowed to stay on their parents' insurance until 26?

01:24.958 --> 01:29.130
Because he can't get any jobs for them to go out and buy their own insurance.

01:29.588 --> 01:31.802
I have an offer to the parents of America:...

01:32.008 --> 01:35.496
...elect us and your kids will be able to move out because they'll have work.
