What has Massachusetts given us?

00:02.231 --> 00:05.965
A liberal governor who wanted us to believe he is strong on defense.

00:06.206 --> 00:09.984
A liberal senator who wanted us to believe he was a man of the people.

00:10.398 --> 00:13.793
And a Massachusetts moderate who runs away from Ronald Reagan.

00:14.488 --> 00:16.712
Look, I was an Independent during the time of Reagan-Bush.

00:16.974 --> 00:18.452
I'm not trying to return to Reagan-Bush.

00:18.574 --> 00:20.295
Romney donated to Democrats...

00:20.471 --> 00:23.908
...and given the choice to vote in the Democrat or Republican primary,...

00:24.056 --> 00:25.767
...Romney chose the Democrats,...

00:25.921 --> 00:29.817
...voting for a liberal Democrat instead of President George H. W. Bush.

00:30.099 --> 00:33.611
Romney opposed the contract with America, raised taxes...

00:33.765 --> 00:37.688
...and authored government mandated health care with taxpayer-funded abortions.

00:37.902 --> 00:41.084
But now he tells us, "Trust me, I'm a conservative".

00:41.412 --> 00:45.561
Massachusetts moderate Mitt Romney: he'll say anything to win.

00:45.850 --> 00:46.500
Anything.

00:46.859 --> 00:52.516
And just like John Kerry, he speaks French too.

00:55.715 --> 00:57.774
But he's still a Massachusetts moderate.

00:57.988 --> 01:01.224
And a Massachusetts moderate cannot beat Barack Obama.
