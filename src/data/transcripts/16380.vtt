00:15.893 --> 00:19.248
There have been many revolutions over the last century,...

00:19.329 --> 00:23.365
...but perhaps none as significant as the longevity revolution.

00:24.275 --> 00:30.107
We are living on average today, 34 years longer than our great grandparents did.

00:30.226 --> 00:30.758
Think about that.

00:31.174 --> 00:36.106
That's an entire second adult lifetime that's been added to our lifespan.

00:36.793 --> 00:41.266
And yet, for the most part, our culture has not come to terms with what this means.

00:41.625 --> 00:46.009
We're still living with the old paradigm of age as an arch.

00:46.327 --> 00:48.117
That's the metaphor, the old metaphor.

00:48.191 --> 00:52.360
You're born, you peak at midlife and decline into decrepitude.

00:54.233 --> 00:56.383
Age as pathology.

00:57.262 --> 01:01.166
But many people today: philosophers, artists, doctors, scientists...

01:01.591 --> 01:04.477
...are taking a new look at what I call the third act,...

01:04.880 --> 01:06.623
...the last three decades of life.

01:07.407 --> 01:11.990
They realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life...

01:12.522 --> 01:16.985
...with its own significance as different from midlife...

01:17.107 --> 01:19.821
...as adolescence is from childhood.

01:20.815 --> 01:26.191
And they are asking, we should all be asking, "How do we use this time?"

01:26.790 --> 01:28.615
How do we live it successfully?

01:28.733 --> 01:32.145
What is the appropriate new metaphor for aging?

01:32.640 --> 01:35.885
I've spent the last year researching and writing about this subject.

01:36.291 --> 01:43.119
And I have come to find that a more appropriate metaphor for aging is a staircase,...

01:44.112 --> 01:46.594
...the upward ascension of the human spirit,...

01:47.180 --> 01:51.240
...bringing us into wisdom, wholeness and authenticity.

01:51.635 --> 01:55.450
Age not at all as pathology, age as potential.

01:55.577 --> 01:56.311
And guess what?

01:56.941 --> 01:59.551
This potential is not for the lucky few.

01:59.642 --> 02:07.678
It turns out, most people over 50 feel better, are less stressed, less hostile, less anxious.

02:08.079 --> 02:11.159
We tend to see commonalities more than differences.

02:11.263 --> 02:14.150
Some of the studies even say we're happier.

02:15.377 --> 02:17.857
This is not what I expected, trust me.

02:18.176 --> 02:20.082
I come from a long line of depressives.

02:21.042 --> 02:23.079
As I was approaching my late 40s,...

02:23.377 --> 02:24.734
...when I would wake up in the morning...

02:24.855 --> 02:27.437
...my first six thoughts would all be negative.

02:27.530 --> 02:28.307
Then, I got scared.

02:28.387 --> 02:29.115
I thought, oh my gosh.

02:29.220 --> 02:31.585
I'm gonna become a crotchety, old lady.

02:32.584 --> 02:36.575
But now that I am actually smack-dab in the middle of my own third act,...

02:37.087 --> 02:39.529
...I realize I've never been happier.

02:40.205 --> 02:43.366
I have such a powerful feeling of well-being.

02:44.595 --> 02:48.221
And I've discovered that when you're inside oldness,...

02:48.318 --> 02:51.791
...as opposed to looking at it from the outside, fear subsides.

02:52.117 --> 02:55.595
You realize, you're still yourself, maybe even more so.

02:56.278 --> 03:00.413
You know, Picasso once said, "It takes a long time to become young."

03:02.765 --> 03:04.323
I don't want to romanticize aging.

03:04.431 --> 03:08.308
Obviously, there's no guarantee that it can be a time of fruition and growth.

03:09.428 --> 03:11.003
Some of it is a matter of luck.

03:11.134 --> 03:13.217
Some of it, obviously, is genetic.

03:13.678 --> 03:15.777
One-third of it, in fact, is genetic.

03:15.887 --> 03:17.883
And there isn't much we can do about that.

03:18.450 --> 03:25.234
But that means that two-thirds of how well we do in the third act, we can do something about.

03:26.018 --> 03:28.135
We're gonna discuss what we can do...

03:28.260 --> 03:31.217
...to make these added years really successful...

03:31.764 --> 03:33.831
...and use them to make a difference.

03:34.922 --> 03:36.965
Now, let me say something about the staircase,...

03:37.049 --> 03:41.136
...which may seem like an odd metaphor for seniors...

03:41.235 --> 03:44.013
...given the fact that many seniors are challenged by stairs.

03:45.453 --> 03:46.454
Myself included.

03:48.957 --> 03:53.937
As you may know, the entire world operates on a universal law...

03:54.205 --> 03:57.219
...entropy, the second law of thermodynamics.

03:57.755 --> 04:03.513
Entropy means that everything in the world, everything, is in a state of decline and decay, the arch.

04:04.451 --> 04:09.708
There's only one exception to this universal law, and that is the human spirit,...

04:10.430 --> 04:14.075
...which can continue to evolve upwards the staircase...

04:14.479 --> 04:19.028
...bringing us into wholeness, authenticity and wisdom.
