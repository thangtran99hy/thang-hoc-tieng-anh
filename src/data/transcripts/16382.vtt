I've spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation,...

00:21.433 --> 00:24.265
...hopefully for a good cause, which is self-improvement.

00:24.775 --> 00:30.565
And I've done this in three parts. So first I started with the mind.

00:30.823 --> 00:38.894
And I decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z...

00:39.305 --> 00:44.025
...or, more precisely, from "A-Ak" to "Zywiec." And here's a little image of that.

00:44.213 --> 00:45.871
And this was an amazing year.

00:45.937 --> 00:47.665
It's really a fascinating journey.

00:49.227 --> 00:52.449
It was painful at times, especially for those around me.

00:52.667 --> 00:58.235
My wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation.

01:00.611 --> 01:01.847
It had its downsides.

01:02.405 --> 01:06.605
But after that, I decided to work on the spirit.

01:07.514 --> 01:10.566
As I mentioned last year, I grew up with no religion at all.

01:11.538 --> 01:18.085
I'm Jewish, but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian. Not really.

01:18.595 --> 01:23.359
But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage...

01:23.497 --> 01:26.833
...by actually diving in and trying to live it and immerse myself in it.

01:27.147 --> 01:29.717
So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible.

01:30.205 --> 01:33.931
And from the Ten Commandments to growing my beard,...

01:34.091 --> 01:35.991
...because Leviticus says you cannot shave.

01:36.089 --> 01:38.329
So, this is what I looked like by the end.

01:39.270 --> 01:40.283
Thank you for that reaction.

01:44.171 --> 01:47.033
I look a little like Moses, or Ted Kaczynski.

01:48.111 --> 01:48.876
 I got both of them.

01:49.403 --> 01:51.741
So, there was the topiary there.

01:52.255 --> 01:54.179
And there's the sheep.

01:54.700 --> 01:59.625
Now, the final part of the trilogy was I wanted to focus on the body...

01:59.783 --> 02:02.642
...and try to be the healthiest person I could be,...

02:02.740 --> 02:06.746
...the healthiest person alive. So that's what I've been doing the last couple of years.

02:07.048 --> 02:08.903
And I just finished a couple of months ago.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.520
And I have to say, thank God. 

02:10.823 --> 02:13.559
Because living so healthily was killing me.

02:16.703 --> 02:22.553
It was so overwhelming, because the amount of things you have to do, it's just mind-boggling.

02:22.859 --> 02:26.872
I was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers,...

02:27.214 --> 02:31.645
...and they were telling me all the things I had to do. I had to...

02:32.399 --> 02:37.883
...eat right, exercise, meditate, pet dogs, because that lowers the blood pressure.

02:38.274 --> 02:43.195
I wrote the book on a treadmill, and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book.

02:43.759 --> 02:45.785
I had to put on sunscreen.

02:46.018 --> 02:48.817
This was no small feat, because if you listen to dermatologists,...

02:49.165 --> 02:52.454
...they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen.

02:52.677 --> 02:54.550
And you have to reapply it every two to four hours.

02:54.618 --> 02:58.778
So, I think half of my book advance went into sunscreen.

02:59.101 --> 03:02.427
I was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year.

03:03.619 --> 03:05.589
There was the washing of hands.

03:05.673 --> 03:07.096
I had to do that properly.

03:07.219 --> 03:09.421
And my immunologist told me that...

03:09.665 --> 03:14.852
...I should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house,...

03:14.961 --> 03:17.305
...because those are just orgies of germs.

03:17.611 --> 03:18.945
So, that took a lot of time.

03:19.435 --> 03:24.764
I also tried to be the safest person I could be, because that's a part of health.

03:25.265 --> 03:28.658
I was inspired by the Danish Safety Council.

03:28.852 --> 03:33.839
They started a public campaign that says, "A walking helmet is a good helmet."

03:34.184 --> 03:39.728
So, they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking, but also for walking around.

03:40.362 --> 03:45.881
And you can see there, they're shopping with their helmets.

03:48.222 --> 03:49.655
So yeah, I tried that.

03:52.096 --> 03:53.815
Now it's a little extreme, I admit.

03:54.007 --> 03:58.613
But if you think about this, this is actually, the "Freakonomics" authors wrote about this,...

03:58.991 --> 04:05.191
...that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving.

04:05.394 --> 04:08.955
So, something to think about tonight if you had a couple.
