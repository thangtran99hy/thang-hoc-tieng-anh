00:13.768 --> 00:17.908
I am Major Nana Twumasi-Ankrah of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment.

00:18.829 --> 00:21.645
I was born in Ghana but I now live in the United Kingdom.

00:22.185 --> 00:24.246
And this is "See Britain Through My Eyes."

00:29.949 --> 00:32.681
I moved to the United Kingdom in 1982 with my family.

00:32.929 --> 00:38.585
I was the first black officer commissioned within the Household Division and into the Household Cavalry itself.

00:39.121 --> 00:40.769
It's the most senior regiment in the British Army.

00:42.775 --> 00:46.691
I command 120 men and 120 horses here in London.

00:49.062 --> 00:53.563
As a young child watching Her Majesty the Queen's birthday parade on the television,...

00:53.953 --> 01:00.211
...I would have never ever imagined that one day I would command the regiment which I had fallen in love with on that day.

01:04.087 --> 01:05.809
We serve on operations in Afghanistan.

01:05.884 --> 01:09.039
We do that in light armored vehicles, for want of a better word, tanks.

01:10.363 --> 01:15.457
We are modern soldiers at the forefront of British operations, who have served with the most modern equipment.

01:18.429 --> 01:21.988
I think this symbolizes one of the best things about being British,...

01:22.370 --> 01:26.342
...the ability to have one eye on the past but also looking to the future.

01:30.743 --> 01:35.932
My first ever venture into the state ceremonial side of our regiment was for the Ghanaian state visit.

01:36.462 --> 01:43.358
Having to escort Her Majesty the Queen and also the President of Ghana was an incredible privilege for me.

01:47.365 --> 01:51.600
Also, we had lots of Ghanaians in the crowd so there was lots of drumming, shouting and cheering.

01:52.547 --> 01:55.460
You can't see anything like this anywhere in the world except in the UK.

01:59.114 --> 02:00.120
Household Cavalry!

02:00.494 --> 02:05.253
And here I was, a Ghanaian who joined the British Army who has now become part of that culture,...

02:05.773 --> 02:10.110
...and it's then personified by that parade, which is the highest respect we can pay to any foreign dignitary...

02:10.466 --> 02:15.397
...when Her Majesty receives them and allows them to travel in the carriage with her to Buckingham Palace.

02:15.829 --> 02:17.622
And it truly is an amazing day.

02:18.291 --> 02:20.077
So that respect goes both ways.

02:20.401 --> 02:23.368
From the Commonwealth to Britain, and then in return from Britain to the Commonwealth.

02:26.959 --> 02:31.872
Those of us from Commonwealth countries generally tend to idolize a British way of life and British culture.

02:32.313 --> 02:33.379
So it's placed on a pedestal.

02:33.750 --> 02:43.293
So everything, from bowler hats and umbrellas, having afternoon tea, going to church on Sundays, is held in high regard.

02:44.097 --> 02:49.907
Even though it's still the last bastion of standards, when you start working and living in Britain from day to day,...

02:50.003 --> 02:52.414
...you realize that things aren't as rigid as they appear.

02:53.276 --> 02:56.161
Life is slightly more casual than you'd expect to see it.

02:57.293 --> 02:58.467
We can't always be on show.

03:01.053 --> 03:02.773
At the end of the day, we're still normal people.

03:03.400 --> 03:09.141
A good example would be in the way that the public can mock members of Parliament or even the Royal Family.

03:09.572 --> 03:12.662
It's open season for making whatever comments you wish to make about people.

03:13.033 --> 03:18.464
And it says to people that we're comfortable in the way we live, and that is the basis of a democracy.

03:22.838 --> 03:29.081
Simply looking around, this regiment appears to be very traditional and very British, projecting that one image.

03:29.623 --> 03:35.465
But really, you simply have to look around and you realize that it is a synthesis of different cultures.

03:36.238 --> 03:39.287
The regiment really can be compared to a modern-day United Nations.

03:39.811 --> 03:46.233
And here we have a Swedish officer, we have an Indian officer, we have myself from Ghana,...

03:46.534 --> 03:51.012
...we have an officer of French and Arab descent and a Zimbabwean,...

03:51.237 --> 03:54.524
...and officers from so many different backgrounds all mixed together as one.

03:56.015 --> 04:01.458
From where I sit and the things I've seen in the United Kingdom, cultures really do mix and intermingle.

04:01.968 --> 04:04.530
And if I'm not a good example of that, I really don't know what is.
