00:39.198 --> 00:42.834
In 1975, I first arrived in the UK.

00:43.545 --> 00:49.295
I was going up to Yorkshire to the junior school, Ampleforth, in a castle.

00:50.485 --> 00:51.437
I was eight and a half.

00:52.491 --> 00:55.541
A young African boy from a totally different culture,...

00:55.701 --> 00:58.094
...totally different background, totally different everything.

00:59.959 --> 01:03.121
Definitely a world apart from Lesotho.

01:05.845 --> 01:09.025
I was stuck to the window for most of the journey,...

01:09.911 --> 01:14.165
...watching the green countryside; the animals roaming in the grass.

01:14.271 --> 01:17.925
And there I was thinking, I wish,...

01:18.743 --> 01:24.689
...I wish I could somehow get my father's sheep up here to get them fattened up...

01:25.353 --> 01:27.939
...and ready for slaughter or something ridiculous like that.

01:29.418 --> 01:31.875
Every time I saw a castle alone in the distance I'd say,...

01:32.087 --> 01:33.819
..."Oh is that the school, is that the school?"

01:34.065 --> 01:37.590
But the train just kept going on and on and on.

01:39.607 --> 01:46.413
I last was up there in 1982 just after completing my O levels.

01:47.719 --> 01:52.986
Today, for me, all sorts of things are playing in my head.

02:01.217 --> 02:08.053
Coming back to my former school, Ampleforth, after so many years,...

02:08.673 --> 02:12.523
...it does bring back for me a common, shared history.

02:14.774 --> 02:17.540
It is frightening for somebody from outside.

02:18.876 --> 02:25.549
Hearing the history, reading the history that Britain invaded half the world...

02:26.153 --> 02:32.224
...imposed itself on half the world, it is seemingly an island.

02:32.311 --> 02:35.825
 Imposing, unfriendly and unwelcoming.

02:36.815 --> 02:37.686
But you have to step in.

02:39.368 --> 02:44.293
I could easily say that England under a microscope, take it as Ampleforth.

02:45.751 --> 02:54.263
The valley and the buildings in the valley are very set and they're very hard and very imposing.

02:54.831 --> 02:56.479
And that can be intimidating.

02:57.071 --> 03:00.736
And I'm saying, you can easily be intimidated...

03:00.839 --> 03:07.675
...and stay away from that valley and stay away from those huge impressive buildings.

03:08.064 --> 03:13.969
But, I think the challenge is actually to get in and feel the music inside the abbey.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.402
I'm going to disappear slightly in here, alright.

03:21.597 --> 03:23.865
Oh, thank you very much.

03:26.551 --> 03:34.362
On those stairs, no, I think it was only on very special occasions or something.

03:34.450 --> 03:39.202
I can't remember what it was, but great.

03:41.169 --> 03:42.263
And who was your headmaster?

03:42.413 --> 03:46.049
Oh God, what's his name now? Shame on me, I should remember.

03:46.787 --> 03:50.033
This used to be dormitories for certain, definitely.

03:51.427 --> 03:57.055
And there were a couple of bunks here which we used to use...

03:57.142 --> 04:01.203
...and have a good view of the grounds up there.

04:05.826 --> 04:11.215
I lived in this room for a number of months or a year or two.

04:14.304 --> 04:15.943
I hardly spoke a word of English.

04:16.662 --> 04:25.251
My first lesson was French, my second lesson on the first week was Latin.

04:26.574 --> 04:33.157
Now, that was a baptism of fire. Everything else apart from that was all smooth sailing.

04:37.805 --> 04:45.643
I was lucky enough, at the very first introduction to my stint in the UK,...

04:46.459 --> 04:54.842
..to have a very accommodating, very understanding and a very friendly group of people around me.

04:55.850 --> 05:04.889
Friends who made me feel very welcome and who were very positively curious about Lesotho.

05:05.765 --> 05:10.781
...and a number of them actually, I brought back a number of Sesotho dictionaries...

05:10.872 --> 05:13.417
...and they learned a few Sesotho words immediately.

05:16.966 --> 05:21.025
My first experience really was a very positive experience.

05:24.181 --> 05:31.390
Sometimes, we see the British as a cold, uninviting breed of people.

05:32.047 --> 05:36.067
But being here, I saw something else very different.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.631
There is more welcome, there's more warmth.

05:51.995 --> 05:52.932
There's more interaction.

05:54.433 --> 05:59.891
Human to human, person to person interaction is very strong in this country and I cherish that.
