My name is Sir Mohammed Anwar Pervez, OBE.

00:26.688 --> 00:32.277
I'd like to show you a letter which I received from Margaret Thatcher.

00:33.666 --> 00:39.301
She was not the Prime Minister at that time, but she wrote me a message:...

00:39.641 --> 00:48.711
..."Sir Anwar Pervez OBE, may I add my own congratulation to those of your many other friends and admirers..."

00:49.207 --> 00:53.968
"...as you celebrate the award of your knighthood from Her Majesty, the Queen."

00:54.768 --> 01:02.660
I'm very proud of it because, you know, she more or less has my frame of mind.

01:04.406 --> 01:16.076
Although she is known to be a very tough lady, but in her mind and heart the community and people are very important for her.

01:16.629 --> 01:18.069
And so I feel the same way.

01:22.173 --> 01:26.294
I opened my first Cash & Carry in 1976.

01:29.209 --> 01:40.219
From one shop, now we have 51 wholesale warehouses in the UK with nearly one hundred thousand square feet in each depot.

01:42.122 --> 01:45.392
Four and a half thousand people are working quite quickly.

01:47.119 --> 01:48.583
Turnover is over two billion.

01:52.657 --> 01:54.354
But I don't feel we are big.

01:57.850 --> 02:00.064
In the UK, I became very successful...

02:00.447 --> 02:06.971
...and for Pakistani listeners I'll say that the secret of this country is that no matter what color you are, what nationality you are,...

02:07.111 --> 02:13.547
...you are treated as a human being. Indian, Pakistani, West Indian, wherever you are from.

02:14.169 --> 02:17.546
If you are on this soil, you have equal opportunity for everybody.
