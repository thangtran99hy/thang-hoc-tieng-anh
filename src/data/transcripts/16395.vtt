My dad was a general surgeon in Egypt.

00:42.074 --> 00:44.367
I was fascinated by what he did.

00:45.185 --> 00:54.295
And then my aunt, his sister died in her early 20s from a heart disease...

00:55.573 --> 01:00.177
...and I saw this happen and how he was upset for years.

01:01.027 --> 01:04.233
And I declared I wanted to be a heart surgeon.

01:08.287 --> 01:12.877
I started the journey in Egypt where I studied medicine...

01:13.449 --> 01:17.648
...but immediately after that, I came to the United Kingdom...

01:17.877 --> 01:22.715
...because I was convinced that was the place I wanted to practice in.

01:27.530 --> 01:37.038
I liked very much the system of the National Health Service because it was egalitarian.

01:39.046 --> 01:42.926
You strive for giving the best to everybody.

01:43.372 --> 01:51.615
And I think that's really important and it is a model for the rest of the world to follow.

01:53.592 --> 01:59.480
I think the National Health Service speaks loads about the character of the British people.

02:00.536 --> 02:03.920
The National Health Service provides a very good model...

02:04.227 --> 02:12.452
...for making health care at the highest level achievable for those who need it.

02:16.715 --> 02:21.388
We are sitting now in the Magdi Yacoub Institute.
