I came to Britain in the late 1960s and we lived in Huddersfield.

00:34.574 --> 00:36.081
When I got married, I moved up to Glasgow.

00:38.739 --> 00:43.550
This is an area called Westwood which is about 15 miles out of Glasgow City center.

00:44.165 --> 00:47.549
It's a very peaceful area, as you can see. It's surrounded by hills.

00:48.107 --> 00:52.213
The kind of life I lead, the kind of life our family leads is perfect.

00:52.825 --> 00:53.769
I really enjoy living here.

00:59.666 --> 01:04.407
Those who came from the rural backgrounds of the Punjab, whether it was India or Pakistan,...

01:05.105 --> 01:07.362
...came really looking for a better economic life.

01:08.674 --> 01:13.697
I suppose those people who continue to live within a community context feel that they need that around them...

01:13.798 --> 01:17.517
...because it gives them an identity, a safety and a cultural context.

01:18.680 --> 01:23.921
Most British people don't have any objection to people living in the communities that they choose to live in.

01:24.782 --> 01:28.038
The very fact that people are being allowed to live in this way...

01:28.622 --> 01:32.323
...is a reflection of the kind of laissez-faire attitude of the British;...

01:33.565 --> 01:37.487
...that as long as you're law-abiding, everybody is entitled to live the kind of life they want.

01:40.327 --> 01:47.672
I think there may be a silent expectation that people who migrate to this country take part in this country.

01:48.462 --> 01:52.139
But I don't think there's any expectation at all that people give up their faith.

01:53.023 --> 01:56.099
You know, we have over two million Muslims living in the UK.

01:57.543 --> 02:01.351
I think most of them are very happy to be living here irrespective of what's happening in the global scene.

02:08.443 --> 02:12.819
I came into academia largely through a scholarship I received at Manchester University.

02:13.417 --> 02:17.839
And from then on, Islamic studies and Islamic law became my main research area.

02:19.485 --> 02:22.143
Law is theology. Law is thinking. Law is ethics.

02:25.099 --> 02:27.677
This country does allow you opportunities.

02:28.557 --> 02:31.214
Nobody is going to force you to take any opportunities,...

02:31.747 --> 02:35.259
...nobody is going to get in your way if you want to take opportunities.

02:35.765 --> 02:40.681
If you have a goal and if you're prepared to work hard, you can achieve whatever you want to achieve in this country.

02:41.655 --> 02:45.397
And I think that that's the kind of ethos I want to instill in my own children.

02:46.706 --> 02:50.745
This isn't a society that's going to force you in any direction.

02:51.828 --> 02:56.325
But on the other hand, if you do take opportunities and you do try and better yourself,...

02:56.736 --> 03:02.977
...as well as trying to better the society around you, people appreciate that and people do help you along that journey.

03:03.665 --> 03:06.981
But in the end, the journey is for you to make and no one can make that journey for you.
