00:23.313 --> 00:24.319
My name is Manoj Badale.

00:26.105 --> 00:29.039
I guess I'm what you would call a serial entrepreneur.

00:31.329 --> 00:35.298
I was born in India but grew up in this country when my parents moved here.

00:35.531 --> 00:40.614
And in my experience, having had the benefit of traveling around the world quite a lot,...

00:42.042 --> 00:46.279
...the UK and Brits and British society are pretty tolerant.

00:46.898 --> 00:51.430
And I think without that tolerance I perhaps wouldn't have gotten the opportunities I got,...

00:51.568 --> 00:55.629
...whether they were university or school or sports-related,...

00:55.728 --> 00:57.527
...and then ultimately business-related.

00:58.773 --> 01:02.585
The reason I'm here tonight in the heart of the British Establishment in London is...

01:02.872 --> 01:07.984
...because I'm giving a talk to a collection of young British and Indian entrepreneurs.

01:09.611 --> 01:15.193
The shared history between Britain and South Asia in particular is extraordinarily powerful.

01:16.086 --> 01:19.203
What I'm going to talk to them a bit about is the realities of doing business in India.

01:19.446 --> 01:22.106
I started my career in the rather formal world.

01:22.169 --> 01:26.739
We've got a collection of successful entrepreneurs and a collection of early stage entrepreneurs,...

01:26.861 --> 01:32.592
...people hopefully trying to get a few pearls of wisdom from people that have got the battle scars.

01:33.773 --> 01:36.974
I think in terms of what their expectations are,...

01:37.363 --> 01:41.844
...they're probably looking forward to hearing about our recent experiences in the world of cricket.

01:44.364 --> 01:48.172
Of course, cricket was something that was actually invented in this country.

01:48.691 --> 01:53.125
People are often surprised to find out that I actually personally prefer Test cricket to Twenty20.

01:55.738 --> 02:01.393
But I was always amazed at just how passionate the Indian market is about the game of cricket.

02:02.983 --> 02:09.326
And you didn't need to be a rocket scientist to sort of know that at some point Twenty20 would become huge in India.

02:12.605 --> 02:18.817
We took a British concept, "Pop Idol," and applied it to a cricket market.

02:19.010 --> 02:20.824
We created a television show called "Cricket Star."

02:28.619 --> 02:30.821
Then when the Indian Premier League came along,...

02:31.927 --> 02:32.540
He's going for it,...

02:32.755 --> 02:33.368
...he's found a gap,...

02:34.362 --> 02:36.004
...Rajasthan Royals win!

02:36.561 --> 02:43.577
...that's when we acquired the Jaipur franchise which is now a well-known brand, the Rajasthan Royals.

02:43.779 --> 02:46.285
Get down, you're ready! Brilliant!

02:46.913 --> 02:52.903
We tried to create a thing called the Champions League. The television rights for the Champions League in 2008,...

02:53.050 --> 02:55.651
...got sold for 1.6 billion dollars for ten years.

02:56.355 --> 03:00.711
But the two things that have always kept me going are if you're more innovative than your competition...

03:01.117 --> 03:03.639
...and you're more agile than your competition, you've always got a chance.

03:03.834 --> 03:05.197
There's a rebalancing of world cricket.

03:05.478 --> 03:15.233
For Britain and British companies to really seize on the potential that South Asia offers, there needs to be an acceptance that,...

03:15.579 --> 03:17.859
..you know, the balance of power is changing economically.

03:18.413 --> 03:25.002
But I think the rise of Asia creates huge opportunities for businesses in the UK because of our shared history.

03:26.762 --> 03:33.627
And it's a real asset for entrepreneurs who have the ability to straddle both markets, whether it's a product...

03:33.778 --> 03:37.204
...or a platform that you've built for America, or built for Asia, or built for Europe.

03:38.114 --> 03:44.199
In many respects, the UK is the perfect place to launch a business for any of those markets.

03:45.625 --> 03:49.504
In terms of raising capital, this is the center of the world's financial services.

03:50.795 --> 03:58.909
Access to talent, you know, we've got some of the best educational institutes in this country, many of whom encourage entrepreneurship.

04:02.047 --> 04:06.807
So, if you are an Indian living in the UK and you are thinking about starting a business,...

04:08.764 --> 04:12.243
...you're sort of crazy not to look at the potential that you get.

04:12.373 --> 04:18.490
The potential asset you get from the connectedness of the UK, with the fact that a quarter of the world's population...

04:19.093 --> 04:23.690
...is resident in a market that you have a cultural sensitivity around.

04:25.170 --> 04:28.985
The link for me is that if you want to be an entrepreneur,...

04:29.070 --> 04:35.434
...if you want to build your own businesses, you've got everything you need in this country.
