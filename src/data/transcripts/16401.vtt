My name is Claudia Bausewein.

00:23.357 --> 00:28.485
When I first came as a medical student, there was no palliative care setting in Germany at all.

00:28.853 --> 00:32.733
So, it was very clear to go to the place where it originated,...

00:32.831 --> 00:35.455
...where it started and where the best expertise was.

00:36.031 --> 00:37.351
And this is the UK obviously.

00:39.795 --> 00:45.624
Britain is the country where the modern hospice movement started with Dame Cicely Saunders in the mid-60s.

00:46.163 --> 00:49.195
It was Dame Cicely who really put the patient in the center.

00:50.090 --> 00:58.831
And she taught us a lot regarding listening, how to deal with the patient, how to focus on their situation,...

00:59.205 --> 01:04.632
...seeing them from a holistic point of view, not only seeing them from their disease or illness.

01:06.043 --> 01:10.056
As a researcher in palliative care, I work with other specialists...

01:10.346 --> 01:15.344
...and we try together to improve the care of the patients.

01:15.759 --> 01:18.907
We are not focusing on any diagnostic tests.

01:20.144 --> 01:24.928
We are focusing on the patient and their views, their experience.

01:25.009 --> 01:27.167
Today we're going to be meeting one of my patients,...

01:27.368 --> 01:30.594
...Kim, who I've been doing some work with to help manage her breathlessness.

01:31.241 --> 01:35.425
People often say there's no success if you look after dying patients.

01:35.645 --> 01:39.165
And I say it's always a question of how I define success.

01:40.462 --> 01:47.583
If success only means somebody needs healing or somebody has to be cured from a disease,...

01:47.997 --> 01:50.055
...then obviously we might not be successful.

01:50.130 --> 01:57.721
But if success is that if somebody is coming in pain, maybe for weeks or months, hasn't slept well,...

01:57.827 --> 02:00.395
...and hasn't been able to be in contact with the family,...

02:00.683 --> 02:03.094
Are you practicing that at home as well regularly?

02:03.867 --> 02:07.183
...and if you are able to help them and to relieve the pain,...

02:07.255 --> 02:10.695
...breathing techniques that I've taught Kim and that she's been putting into action...

02:10.908 --> 02:12.650
...and if somebody is saying after a week,...

02:12.707 --> 02:15.819
..."Oh, I'm much better. I can sleep well, I've got my energy back,..."

02:16.211 --> 02:17.602
...this is a huge success.

02:18.207 --> 02:22.251
And hold. Okay. So relax those shoulders.

02:29.941 --> 02:38.333
So for me it is very satisfying work, focusing on the human being that is sort of my partner.

02:40.214 --> 02:41.609
And back, that's it.

02:42.333 --> 02:43.098
Alright.

02:46.694 --> 02:53.369
Health care in Britain is much more seen as part of the community and of society.

02:55.039 --> 03:01.156
I think looking after people is very much in the hearts and minds of people in this country.

03:01.737 --> 03:09.023
And really caring for people who are disabled, who are very ill,...

03:09.152 --> 03:16.159
...who are very old is very much part of how people want to be cared for.

03:16.242 --> 03:19.593
And also how people want other people to be cared for.

03:22.997 --> 03:28.468
As a medical student in Germany, I was reading about palliative care or the hospice movement in the UK,...

03:28.608 --> 03:33.319
...and I thought, oh this sounds nice and this is really almost unrealistic.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.633
It sounded so wonderful.

03:36.138 --> 03:40.749
But when I came here and realized that this is really working.

03:41.594 --> 03:42.845
This is reality.

03:42.950 --> 03:48.489
This is not only a vision in a book, but I experienced it myself and became part of it.

03:49.323 --> 03:55.441
Becoming part of this hospice family was a great experience for me.

04:04.505 --> 04:09.469
When Dame Cicely started this hospice movement, I think it was always her vision to have a center,...

04:09.942 --> 04:13.631
...a beacon for research for patient care and for education.

04:14.136 --> 04:20.761
This building, the Cicely Saunders Institute, really emphasizes that Britain is always ahead...

04:21.047 --> 04:22.929
...regarding research in palliative care.

04:23.385 --> 04:29.727
And now there is a building which is saying that palliative medicine and palliative care is important.

04:29.837 --> 04:30.555
We need them.

04:32.527 --> 04:36.454
And now I would like to see that we not only do research here in the UK,...

04:36.723 --> 04:39.591
...but that we do high-quality research in Germany as well.
