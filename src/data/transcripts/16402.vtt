00:22.943 --> 00:23.518
Very old.

00:25.447 --> 00:26.733
I grew up listening to these songs.

00:26.981 --> 00:33.705
My family would play these songs to me when I was a little girl and make me sing them.

00:36.313 --> 00:39.781
I love hearing Arabic melodies on Western music.

00:41.015 --> 00:43.692
And now, I can walk around comfortably as an Arab in Britain...

00:43.771 --> 00:47.176
...because people can celebrate the culture with me.

00:48.410 --> 00:52.465
For me, it's great that it's embedded here in Britain.

00:54.535 --> 00:59.467
Taking it back to when I was younger, going to school, growing up and going to college,...

00:59.671 --> 01:02.025
...when I was living in Britain, I used to feel very British.

01:04.657 --> 01:06.221
Now, I feel very Palestinian.

01:07.813 --> 01:13.370
But, in terms of how I think, I think the open-mindedness has definitely come from Britain.

01:14.561 --> 01:15.995
It definitely comes from growing up here,...

01:16.117 --> 01:19.049
...and that's, I think,  that's how British I feel.

01:21.235 --> 01:26.361
I've been given the privilege of knowing what freedom feels like, being here.

01:28.987 --> 01:34.860
I have the option of choosing what path I want to go down and that's part of the journey.

01:35.591 --> 01:37.024
And I've taken that with me.

01:38.685 --> 01:44.188
Well, actually no, it's taken me with it through music.

01:59.886 --> 02:02.507
When I started rapping in Arabic, it started off as a hobby.

02:02.837 --> 02:06.757
I wasn't uncomfortable with singing, like rapping in English or singing in English,...

02:06.905 --> 02:14.100
...but I felt like I really had to, I had to be honest and real with myself and original.

02:15.912 --> 02:17.090
I wanted to claim a voice.

02:17.162 --> 02:22.693
I wanted to claim an identity in terms of being a Palestinian and the diaspora.

02:43.028 --> 02:47.586
When I went and actually performed the songs live in Palestine, in front of a live audience,...

02:48.551 --> 02:50.399
...it was an amazing experience, going there...

02:50.606 --> 02:54.517
...and seeing the people that listen to my music face to face...

02:54.665 --> 02:58.907
...and trying to keep their identity and maintain it.

03:01.638 --> 03:03.135
It's like taking the songs home.

03:05.143 --> 03:13.413
Actually, going to Palestine really made me appreciate the privileges we have here.

03:14.490 --> 03:18.050
You actually have a chance here to have your voice heard.

03:24.232 --> 03:27.351
I value the freedom of speech in Britain.

03:29.524 --> 03:33.851
And I've started to appreciate that, whereas before I didn't actually notice it.

03:34.149 --> 03:34.974
I didn't realize it.

03:35.242 --> 03:39.135
So I do feel like that's been kind of a backbone for me.

03:40.537 --> 03:46.621
I'd have to say definitely that British society and Britain as a whole has been kind of like a backbone.

03:48.265 --> 03:54.259
It's shaped my ability to be able to do what I do with no restrictions.
