ï»¿Why are all these people wearing red?

00:06.495 --> 00:08.523
We wear red because we care.

00:09.485 --> 00:12.074
We wear red because we love our heart.

00:13.051 --> 00:18.924
SMU joins companies across America to support the American Heart Association's Go Red for Women movement...

00:19.365 --> 00:21.407
...by celebrating National Wear Red day.

00:22.169 --> 00:24.899
This year's event was held on Friday, February 5th,...

00:25.303 --> 00:32.059
...where more than 175 SMU students, staff and faculty gathered on the steps of Dallas Hall to show their support.

00:32.642 --> 00:38.021
SMU is supporting us in educating our young students.

00:38.223 --> 00:44.223
Hopefully getting to them sooner, rather than later, to educate them about the importance of having a healthy heart.

00:44.859 --> 00:47.167
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women.

00:47.621 --> 00:50.749
It kills over 432,000 women each year.

00:51.231 --> 00:53.685
That ends up being about one woman every minute.

00:54.544 --> 01:00.951
Yet studies show that only 21 percent of women view heart disease as their greatest threat even more than cancer.

01:01.354 --> 01:03.857
I think it's important because you really need to get the word out...

01:03.942 --> 01:10.013
...and we've made so much progress that it's kind of sad if we don't get the word out since we know so much information at this point.

01:10.473 --> 01:12.417
So we don't want that to be the reason why people suffer...

01:12.510 --> 01:16.885
...just because they didn't get the knowledge or the information that's widely available for everyone.

01:17.763 --> 01:21.352
SMU supports Go Red for Women.
