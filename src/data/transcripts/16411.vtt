00:00.737 --> 00:06.109
Three great men: a king, a priest, and a rich man.

00:07.219 --> 00:09.529
Between them stands a common sellsword.

00:10.383 --> 00:13.580
Each great man bids the sellsword, "Kill the other two."

00:14.499 --> 00:16.431
Who lives? Who dies?

00:17.943 --> 00:21.518
Power resides where men believe it resides.

00:22.715 --> 00:25.253
It's a trick, a shadow on the wall.

00:26.770 --> 00:33.893
And a very small man can cast a very large shadow.

00:35.525 --> 00:37.044
You're fighting to overthrow a king.

00:37.353 --> 00:39.823
Killing you would send your brother a message.

00:41.689 --> 00:44.723
You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead.

00:46.917 --> 00:51.526
I am Daenerys Stormborn and I will take what is mine with fire and blood.

00:52.645 --> 00:53.683
Anyone can be killed.

00:59.854 --> 01:02.021
I understand the way this game is played.
