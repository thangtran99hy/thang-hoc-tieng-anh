00:02.397 --> 00:03.516
I've known rivers.

00:05.751 --> 00:11.619
I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins.

00:12.983 --> 00:15.399
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

00:18.918 --> 00:21.537
I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.

00:22.507 --> 00:25.405
I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.

00:26.837 --> 00:29.321
I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.

00:30.291 --> 00:34.079
I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went down to New Orleans,...

00:34.496 --> 00:38.823
...and I've seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset.

00:40.927 --> 00:46.295
I've known rivers. Ancient, dusky rivers.

00:47.735 --> 00:50.715
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.
