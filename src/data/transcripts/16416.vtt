00:06.180 --> 00:08.643
We could do it, you know. Take off, live in the woods.

00:08.907 --> 00:09.549
They'd catch us.

00:09.719 --> 00:10.293
Maybe not.

00:10.643 --> 00:11.799
We wouldn't make it five miles.

00:25.976 --> 00:32.883
Welcome, welcome. The time has come to select one courageous young man and woman...

00:32.968 --> 00:38.937
...for the honor of representing District 12 in the 74th annual Hunger Games.

00:40.065 --> 00:41.084
It's your first year, Prim.

00:41.146 --> 00:43.363
Your name's only been in there once, they're not gonna pick you.

00:49.731 --> 00:51.439
Primrose Everdeen.

00:52.975 --> 00:59.165
Prim! I volunteer! I volunteer as tribute.

01:03.601 --> 01:07.831
Our tributes, Peeta Mellark and Katniss Everdeen.

01:08.195 --> 01:09.683
They just want a good show, that's all they want.

01:10.047 --> 01:12.105
There's 24 of us and only one comes out.

01:20.658 --> 01:22.008
So you're here to make me look pretty?

01:23.307 --> 01:24.579
I'm here to help you make an impression.

01:26.473 --> 01:28.775
Until it was decreed that each year,...

01:29.045 --> 01:34.129
...the 12 districts of Panem shall offer up in tribute one young man and woman...

01:34.273 --> 01:42.786
...between the ages of 12 and 18 to be trained in the art of survival and to be prepared to fight to the death.

01:43.691 --> 01:48.254
This is the time to show them everything. Make sure they remember you.

01:51.341 --> 01:54.524
I just keep wishing I could think of a way to show them that they don't own me.

01:55.129 --> 01:57.340
If I'm gonna die, I want to still be me.

01:58.096 --> 01:59.549
I just can't afford to think like that.

02:08.810 --> 02:19.589
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
