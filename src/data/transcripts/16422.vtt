00:08.118 --> 00:10.945
I vow to live within the warmth of your heart.

00:11.185 --> 00:15.145
I promise to never forget that this is a once in a lifetime love.

00:15.615 --> 00:16.102
Security.

00:17.007 --> 00:18.263
I now pronounce you man and wife.

00:18.332 --> 00:18.951
Kiss. Run!

00:23.205 --> 00:25.461
Life's all about moments of impact...

00:28.039 --> 00:29.051
You want to go see a movie?

00:29.497 --> 00:29.797
No.

00:31.767 --> 00:34.479
Move in? Yes.

00:34.735 --> 00:41.235
...and how they change our lives forever. What if one day you could no longer remember any of them?

00:44.706 --> 00:47.733
Paige, you're in the hospital. You were in a car accident.

00:48.079 --> 00:48.671
Any pain?

00:49.055 --> 00:49.953
My head hurts.

00:50.183 --> 00:51.208
I'll get you something for that.

00:51.810 --> 00:53.817
Was anyone else hurt, doctor?

00:57.287 --> 00:58.800
Paige, you know who I am, right?

00:59.791 --> 01:00.131
Yeah.

01:01.542 --> 01:01.992
Okay.

01:03.132 --> 01:04.185
You're my doctor.

01:08.381 --> 01:09.327
She doesn't remember me.

01:09.697 --> 01:11.821
Her memory is going to improve with time.

01:12.361 --> 01:14.253
Come home with me, we'll figure this out together.

01:14.557 --> 01:17.811
I don't know you. I barely even know who I am.

01:18.026 --> 01:19.793
I need to make my wife fall in love with me again.

01:24.717 --> 01:29.234
I'll always love you, the fact is that you're just meeting me and I'm just a stranger.

01:29.354 --> 01:32.508
I hope one day I can love the way that you love me.

01:33.698 --> 01:36.508
How do you look at the girl you love and tell yourself, "It's time to walk away"?

01:42.073 --> 01:46.248
I vow to love you and no matter what challenges might carry us apart,...

01:47.052 --> 01:49.247
...we will always find a way back to each other.
