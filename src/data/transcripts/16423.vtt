00:00.467 --> 00:01.776
It's our netbooks, kids!

00:01.971 --> 00:09.196
History teacher Luke Rosa wheels his cart filled with laptops into a classroom at Falls Church High School in Virginia.

00:10.257 --> 00:14.579
I mean it's just like a regular textbook except it's got all online.

00:15.462 --> 00:18.569
This school year, the Fairfax County Public School System...

00:18.633 --> 00:21.710
...has shifted from hardcover to electronic textbooks...

00:22.034 --> 00:24.757
...for social studies in its middle and high schools.

00:25.574 --> 00:28.269
The system's assistant superintendent Peter Noonan...

00:28.644 --> 00:33.256
... says the switch came after digital books were used in 15 schools last year.

00:34.021 --> 00:40.998
Our students come to us technologically savvy and ready to utilize resources from a variety of different places.

00:41.374 --> 00:46.995
Noonan points to the benefits of electronic textbooks such as the ability to update content.

00:47.543 --> 00:54.855
The world is changing consistently and the online textbooks can change right along with the events that are happening.

00:55.413 --> 00:58.294
And there's a significant financial benefit as well.

00:58.827 --> 01:05.205
Usually it's in the neighborhood of between 50 and 70 dollars to buy a textbook for each student....

01:06.299 --> 01:10.948
...which adds up to roughly eight million dollars for all of our students in Fairfax County.

01:11.059 --> 01:18.097
We actually have purchased all the online textbooks for our students for just under six million dollars.

01:18.585 --> 01:22.425
Students have mixed feelings about the switch, but most like it.

01:23.216 --> 01:26.795
I don't have to carry a textbook around, so that's nice.

01:27.334 --> 01:30.175
I don't like it because the Internet sometimes doesn't work.

01:30.885 --> 01:33.419
You can highlight your work, you can leave notes on your work...

01:33.539 --> 01:35.351
...and it will all be saved onto your account.

01:35.497 --> 01:37.065
It's a lot better than a regular textbook.

01:37.712 --> 01:38.595
How about gun control?

01:38.913 --> 01:42.016
Social studies teacher Michael Bambara thinks so too.

01:42.629 --> 01:47.639
Particularly this book that I use in government has differentiated reading levels,...

01:47.823 --> 01:52.589
...so a person can individualize their learning and I can individualize their instruction.

01:53.137 --> 01:59.413
However, making sure all students have online access outside school remains a challenge.

02:00.177 --> 02:06.558
About ten percent of students in Fairfax County don't have a computer or online access at home.

02:07.041 --> 02:09.514
Steven Castillo is one of them.

02:10.025 --> 02:13.118
Pretty much go to a library, I guess, or go to a friend's house.

02:13.709 --> 02:16.677
Besides the public library's free computer terminals,...

02:16.944 --> 02:20.637
...students can also use the school's after-school computer lab...

02:21.131 --> 02:24.691
...or go to one of the computer clubhouses supported by the county.

02:25.440 --> 02:27.546
All of my family works on a computer.

02:28.022 --> 02:30.112
My sister and me both do our homework on it.

02:30.612 --> 02:32.229
So I come here to do my homework.

02:32.741 --> 02:33.099
It's good.

02:33.984 --> 02:37.214
Neighboring counties are also considering online textbooks.

02:37.677 --> 02:41.785
Gladys Whitehead, Director of Curriculum of Prince George's County Public Schools,...

02:42.154 --> 02:46.898
...says its survey shows 60 percent of students have computer access at home.

02:47.509 --> 02:53.807
Next year, we'll just have a pilot with probably one classroom and one subject area,...

02:54.168 --> 03:00.430
...so that we can see what issues will come up with complete online access.

03:00.853 --> 03:05.213
I envision a future where my third grade son will likely not be carrying...

03:05.353 --> 03:08.905
...five textbooks back and forth between high school and home when he gets there.

03:09.362 --> 03:12.899
I think he'll be carrying either a tablet or some sort of device...

03:12.991 --> 03:15.064
...that he will be able to access his information on.

03:15.796 --> 03:21.140
And schools, says Peter Noonan, are taking the first steps in that direction now.

03:21.907 --> 03:25.584
