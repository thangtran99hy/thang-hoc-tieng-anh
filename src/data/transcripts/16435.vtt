Beer Lab.

00:07.039 --> 00:08.039
Beer Lab, okay.

00:12.489 --> 00:14.405
Are you bored of mass-produced beers?

00:14.659 --> 00:16.974
The same old brands and the same dull flavors.

00:17.393 --> 00:20.797
Imagine serving to your friends a unique tasting beer...

00:21.045 --> 00:23.398
...that was invented and brewed by you at Beer Lab.

00:24.159 --> 00:28.139
Beer Lab is a microbrewery, a bar and a bistro in Shanghai.

00:29.081 --> 00:32.638
Beer Lab offers its customers two distinct values.

00:32.922 --> 00:36.670
The first, the opportunity to make your own personal beer.

00:36.996 --> 00:41.568
Second, a venue where fresh food and good food is served.

00:42.339 --> 00:45.948
Beer Lab targets young professionals in China for three reasons.

00:46.498 --> 00:49.655
Their growing number, their rapidly increasing disposable income...

00:49.975 --> 00:52.536
...and their desire for more unique experiences.

00:53.048 --> 00:56.998
We seek 40,000 US dollars to create the first Beer Lab in China.

00:57.589 --> 00:59.695
We expect an IRR of 33 percent.

01:00.141 --> 01:03.565
We have plans for rapid growth into the rest of China and in Asia.

01:04.060 --> 01:07.575
Invest in Beer Lab, where the beer flows and the profits grow.
