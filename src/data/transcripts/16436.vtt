If you've got a great idea but need the cash to make it go,...

00:08.045 --> 00:11.077
...well then you'd better start working on your elevator pitch.

00:22.183 --> 00:23.688
What is an elevator pitch?

00:24.093 --> 00:26.697
It's the term used for the two-minute presentation,...

00:27.003 --> 00:30.167
...the exact amount of time it takes to go from the lobby...

00:31.249 --> 00:35.811
...to the investor's office on the top floor to capture investor interest.

00:36.153 --> 00:39.639
Get it right and they'll invite you into the boardroom.

00:40.021 --> 00:43.311
Get it wrong and they'll call security.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.678
What makes a good elevator pitch?

00:48.812 --> 00:52.532
A good elevator pitch is made up of two key elements.

00:52.951 --> 00:55.897
First, you have to lay out the paying statement.

00:56.667 --> 00:59.151
What problem is it that you are trying to solve?

00:59.270 --> 01:02.841
Second, you must show the value proposition.

01:03.557 --> 01:05.531
How does your venture solve that problem?

01:07.237 --> 01:09.666
That may sound easy, but it's not.

01:10.115 --> 01:13.941
Every great elevator pitch must meet four key tests.

01:14.505 --> 01:19.538
First, it must be succinct. After all, this guy is only going to give you two minutes.

01:19.985 --> 01:25.570
Number two, it must be easy to understand. There's no room for tech talk in an elevator pitch.

01:25.779 --> 01:28.501
Both your grandma and your grandkids have to get it.

01:28.655 --> 01:32.049
Number three, it must be greed-inducing.

01:32.505 --> 01:36.258
After all, investors want to make money and lots of it.

01:36.379 --> 01:39.183
Number four, it has to be irrefutable.

01:39.690 --> 01:44.475
If your elevator pitch leaves investors with more questions than answers, well,...

01:45.064 --> 01:46.906
...you better go back to the drawing board.
