00:05.224 --> 00:08.820
You know more about negotiations than you realize.

00:09.739 --> 00:18.211
I say that because the one group of people that seem to be very successful in negotiation are children.

00:18.794 --> 00:23.311
Many of you in this room have children or at least you're a child yourself.

00:23.879 --> 00:29.284
Children are little people, wee people in a big person's world.

00:30.187 --> 00:34.222
They have no authority or very little, and no power,...

00:34.624 --> 00:39.558
...yet they seem to be able to get what they want and make things happen.

00:39.787 --> 00:43.157
Now, how do they do it?

00:43.279 --> 00:48.743
Well, number one: children aim high.

00:49.427 --> 00:53.555
They know that if you expect more, you get more.

00:54.098 --> 01:01.631
And so they seem to make outrageous demands, more than you will expect them to say.

01:01.881 --> 01:08.805
And because they somehow understand that it raises the expectations of parents.

01:09.216 --> 01:16.137
Second thing that children do or understand is that "No!" N-O,...

01:16.533 --> 01:18.792
...is an opening bargaining position.

01:21.020 --> 01:25.931
So when you say "no" to them, "That is never gonna happen,"...

01:26.401 --> 01:30.231
...they realize, "Well, that's his position at this point in time."

01:32.581 --> 01:35.645
"I'll ask him five minutes later and see how he feels.

01:36.825 --> 01:40.091
Or an hour later, or the next day."

01:40.377 --> 01:43.576
In other words, "no" doesn't mean they're gonna capitulate.

01:43.913 --> 01:47.213
"No" is the start of the negotiations.

01:48.273 --> 01:52.330
The next thing that children understand is...

01:53.231 --> 02:00.512
...who the decision makers are in a family and who influences those decision makers.

02:00.772 --> 02:04.368
So when the mom says "no" to them, "Absolutely, it's never gonna happen,..."

02:04.874 --> 02:06.098
...they wait for the father.

02:06.811 --> 02:07.762
They ask the father.

02:07.909 --> 02:09.270
For once, the two are united.

02:09.428 --> 02:10.778
 Mom and Dad against them.

02:10.889 --> 02:11.569
"There's no way."

02:11.718 --> 02:12.501
Well, what do they do?

02:12.953 --> 02:16.137
They appeal to the next level, grandparents.

02:17.150 --> 02:21.214
And it's easy for them to form a coalition with their grandparents...

02:21.303 --> 02:24.853
...because they have common enemies, the parents.

02:28.847 --> 02:36.137
What children do is they persist, they persevere, they wear you down.

02:36.723 --> 02:39.413
My wife and I, we are the parents of three children.

02:39.504 --> 02:45.144
Our oldest child, we used to have standards and insist that she heeded those standards.

02:45.298 --> 02:50.347
Second child, we had the same standards but with a few more exceptions.

02:50.711 --> 02:51.672
We're a little flexible.

02:52.272 --> 02:54.941
Third child, we were tired people.

02:57.233 --> 03:01.509
I remember saying to the third kid, "Why don't you ask your brother and sister?"

03:03.037 --> 03:05.175
"They'll tell you how it used to be around here."

03:07.279 --> 03:13.377
And so, all of us can learn from our youngsters...

03:13.497 --> 03:18.840
...because a lot of the things that they do would be successful for us.
