00:05.751 --> 00:10.823
I come here to speak to you today about a subject...

00:10.961 --> 00:14.589
...that all of you know a great deal about and that is negotiation.

00:15.038 --> 00:17.775
I said to you earlier that it is a game of life.

00:18.311 --> 00:21.572
It is something that all of us do.

00:22.191 --> 00:25.010
Negotiating is selling.

00:25.617 --> 00:31.662
It is about the reconciling of difference, resolving disputes,...

00:32.007 --> 00:37.818
...managing conflict, establishing or adjusting relationships.

00:38.245 --> 00:44.812
If you talk about leadership, which is getting people to do voluntarily...

00:45.193 --> 00:51.321
...those things that must be done, you're really talking about negotiating.

00:51.687 --> 00:56.754
As I indicated earlier, selling is about negotiating.

00:57.173 --> 01:04.607
It is getting people who are reluctant about products or services,...

01:05.111 --> 01:12.333
...who can't make up their mind, and having them move from reluctance to commitment.

01:12.755 --> 01:18.708
From no to yes, that's what negotiating is about.

01:18.849 --> 01:24.221
And as I indicated to you, it is the game of life.

01:24.475 --> 01:26.987
It is the lifeblood of relationships.

01:27.173 --> 01:33.336
Please note I keep using the term "game" because I like you to see it that way.

01:33.706 --> 01:39.299
Because a game is where you care, really care, but not that much.

01:39.425 --> 01:42.833
Now, why do I say that?

01:43.235 --> 01:48.209
Because who is the worst person that you negotiate for?

01:49.771 --> 01:51.974
I believe the answer is yourself.

01:52.421 --> 01:54.393
I know that's true in my case.

01:54.874 --> 02:00.723
I earn a substantial living by negotiating on behalf of others.

02:00.805 --> 02:05.665
I try to have as my clients very wealthy entrepreneurs,...

02:06.040 --> 02:09.465
...large corporations with money to spend.

02:09.859 --> 02:12.708
And I operate on their behalf in dealmaking.

02:13.161 --> 02:19.921
The way I am compensated is like in a meager, a modest percentage of an enormous deal.

02:21.129 --> 02:24.236
This works out well for myself and my family.

02:24.592 --> 02:27.161
And so I must be pretty good at doing that.

02:27.589 --> 02:32.314
Yet when I negotiate on behalf of myself, I'm close to inept.

02:32.674 --> 02:33.354
I'm pathetic.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.341
Now, why is that the case?

02:35.881 --> 02:39.309
Do you believe it is because I'm lacking in self-esteem?

02:39.938 --> 02:42.159
Let me assure that is not so.

02:43.553 --> 02:46.324
I like me one heck of a lot.

02:46.519 --> 02:53.921
In fact, if I could be more effective for myself and less effective to you,...

02:54.123 --> 02:55.993
...I would prefer it that way.

02:56.481 --> 02:58.884
But in truth, I am better for you.

02:59.164 --> 02:59.755
Why?

02:59.932 --> 03:04.903
Because I don't even know you. I mean, I care about you, but not that much.

03:05.268 --> 03:11.271
And that attitude tends to give me altitude and perspective.

03:11.407 --> 03:17.229
All of you in this room know that the single best way to make a good deal...

03:18.122 --> 03:23.576
...is to convey to the other side, "I can live without this deal."

03:24.442 --> 03:30.633
In other words, as the great negotiator Kenny Rogers once said in a song,...

03:31.353 --> 03:37.856
..."You gotta know when to hold them and once in a while be prepared to fold them and walk away."

03:38.319 --> 03:43.951
And if the other side just senses you might fold them and walk away,...

03:44.401 --> 03:47.415
...they don't let you fold them and walk away.

03:47.724 --> 03:54.601
And so the operative attitude for success and satisfaction in all of life's negotiations...

03:55.013 --> 03:57.645
...is to care, but not that much.
