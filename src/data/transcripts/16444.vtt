00:00.174 --> 00:01.359
Everyone has a tell.

00:01.905 --> 00:03.746
It's after six. What am I, a farmer?

00:06.358 --> 00:08.094
That is the cutest thing I've ever seen!

00:08.172 --> 00:09.169
Isn't that adorable?

00:09.568 --> 00:11.231
You have to fire ten percent of your staff.

00:11.327 --> 00:11.790
I like you.

00:13.189 --> 00:15.097
You have the boldness of a much younger woman.

00:15.529 --> 00:19.257
Now let me hear you say the seven most important words in the American judicial system.

00:19.549 --> 00:21.789
My client has no memory of that.

00:22.289 --> 00:25.904
Pete, did you know that men with full heads of hair, on average,...

00:26.019 --> 00:28.661
...earn 17 percent more than their bald counterparts?

00:29.056 --> 00:29.728
I did not know that.

00:29.835 --> 00:31.448
You see, in poker as in business,...

00:31.752 --> 00:34.593
...the key to success is to determine your opponent's strength...

00:34.713 --> 00:36.593
...and more importantly, his weaknesses.

00:36.944 --> 00:38.138
Everyone has a tell.

00:38.547 --> 00:42.539
Like when Frank is bluffing, he asks a series of inane questions to hide his nervousness.

00:42.617 --> 00:43.743
Oh, really? Is that what you think?

00:43.831 --> 00:44.471
Is that what I do?

00:44.658 --> 00:48.111
I'm sorry for what's about to happen right now. Just know that I don't mean it.

00:48.315 --> 00:48.967
Don't mean what?

00:49.448 --> 00:54.274
What group home did you escape from that you would dare talk to me like some plumber's wife...

00:54.403 --> 00:56.712
...in front of Ron Gordon and Bob Overmyer?

00:57.321 --> 00:58.520
Oh, snap!

01:00.813 --> 01:02.225
Why are you wearing a tux?

01:04.378 --> 01:06.341
It's after six. What am I, a farmer?

01:06.647 --> 01:08.821
So we can either do this the easy way or the hard way.

01:09.567 --> 01:10.409
What's the hard way?

01:10.687 --> 01:14.887
You do a live Christmas Eve's special from Kabul every year until the war on terror is won.

01:15.169 --> 01:16.753
You're always gonna be my son.

01:17.005 --> 01:20.087
Tracy, just because I stopped loving your dad doesn't mean we've stopped loving you.

01:20.269 --> 01:22.009
Stop putting words in my mouth, woman!

01:22.257 --> 01:24.917
Oh, yeah? Poppy, be quiet! People are sleeping!

01:27.401 --> 01:29.375
That is terrific. I really enjoyed that.
