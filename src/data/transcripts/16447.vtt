00:05.909 --> 00:09.704
Another really complex technique that I believe in...

00:11.044 --> 00:15.715
...is that you take notes as they speak.

00:16.097 --> 00:18.492
You write down what they are saying.

00:19.040 --> 00:19.613
Why?

00:19.855 --> 00:26.799
What greater tribute do you pay someone to write down some of the things they say.

00:27.397 --> 00:31.469
In other words, for all I know it's a form of immortality.

00:31.859 --> 00:36.886
This person thinks enough of me to write down what I'm saying.

00:37.510 --> 00:41.895
So, you write it down and then, I'll tell you another thing I do,...

00:42.319 --> 00:47.083
...I read back to them what I've written to make sure I got it right.

00:47.515 --> 00:54.313
In my lifetime, I have found that, rarely if ever has the other side said to me,...

00:54.419 --> 00:56.198
..."You know, you got that right."

00:56.715 --> 00:57.965
"That's exactly what I've said."

00:58.151 --> 00:58.367
No.

00:58.823 --> 01:02.447
Usually they say, "No, you left something out."

01:02.892 --> 01:05.668
Or, "Your emphasis was wrong." 

01:05.829 --> 01:08.042
And what I do is, I don't argue with them.

01:08.626 --> 01:15.481
I change what I've written so they agree that I've gotten down what they said.

01:15.633 --> 01:19.942
In other words, what I'm doing is I'm beginning with agreement...

01:20.387 --> 01:23.071
...even if what they're saying is a complaint.

01:24.462 --> 01:29.433
In essence, I'm saying to them that "he understands what my complaint is."
