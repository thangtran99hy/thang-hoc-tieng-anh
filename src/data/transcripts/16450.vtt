How to paint a wall.

00:03.316 --> 00:05.342
Hello and welcome to Videojug!

00:05.904 --> 00:09.390
We are going to show you how to paint a wall just like a professional.

00:10.015 --> 00:11.721
Step one: You will need...

00:12.583 --> 00:16.200
...a can of your chosen color of paint and possibly an undercoat,...

00:16.819 --> 00:24.647
...a pencil and paper, a measuring tape, a paint tray, paint brushes and a paint roller,...

00:25.777 --> 00:30.994
...a flat headed screwdriver, a sponge, and a roll of masking tape.

00:31.864 --> 00:35.133
Step two: Calculate the amount of paint you will need.

00:35.830 --> 00:38.322
To make sure you have enough paint for the job at hand,...

00:38.666 --> 00:41.214
...you will need to calculate the number of cans needed.

00:42.087 --> 00:45.085
Measure the length of all the walls and add them together...

00:46.017 --> 00:48.366
...times this number by the height of the room...

00:48.516 --> 00:51.634
...and this will give you the total volume of your room in feet squared.

00:53.304 --> 01:00.182
Each one gallon can of paint will cover an average of between 118 and 150 square feet...

01:00.711 --> 01:03.232
...and you should purchase enough for at least two coats.

01:04.775 --> 01:06.569
Step three: Masking.

01:07.442 --> 01:11.403
The best way to get a straight and clean line between the wall and the base boards,...

01:11.661 --> 01:14.965
...light switches and anything else you don't want to accidentally paint...

01:15.732 --> 01:17.290
...is to mask them off with tape.

01:17.911 --> 01:21.090
Although this step is often seen as unduly time-consuming,...

01:21.443 --> 01:24.202
...skipping it will result in an unprofessional finish.

01:24.476 --> 01:28.165
Be sure to use only masking tape especially made for this purpose.

01:28.571 --> 01:33.411
It is sometimes called "painter's tape" and is readily available at DIY stores.

01:34.068 --> 01:38.657
Press down against the tape with your finger or a putty knife to seal it against the surface.

01:39.284 --> 01:42.137
This will prevent the paint from seeping behind the tape.

01:43.293 --> 01:46.460
Step four: Establish whether you will need a primer.

01:47.002 --> 01:51.476
This is dictated by the existing color of your room and the color you wish to paint it.

01:52.239 --> 01:55.887
The higher the contrast, the more likely that it is you will need a primer.

01:56.387 --> 02:00.741
For example, here , the bright letters will take several coats of water-based paint...

02:00.941 --> 02:04.798
...to cover unless an intermediate light gray primer is applied first.

02:05.889 --> 02:11.653
Primer also helps seal the wall and creates a smooth nonporous surface ready for the top coat.

02:12.399 --> 02:17.413
You must always use primer over parts of the walls that have been repaired with filler or spackling.

02:19.853 --> 02:22.395
Step five: You are now ready to paint.

02:23.561 --> 02:26.719
Make sure that windows are open and the room is well-ventilated.

02:27.220 --> 02:29.185
You may also consider wearing a face mask.

02:29.832 --> 02:34.912
Open a can of paint using a flat headed screwdriver and then stir with a painting stick.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.133
Pour the paint into the painting tray.

02:39.503 --> 02:43.383
Dip the roller into the paint and then roll back and forth in the tray...

02:43.772 --> 02:46.416
...until an even coat surrounds the entire roller.

02:47.361 --> 02:51.965
Do not add too much paint as the roller will slide across the wall smearing paint...

02:52.175 --> 02:54.457
...and flicking it over you and the rest of the room.

02:55.671 --> 02:59.607
Gentle forward and back motions will quickly and evenly cover the wall.

03:01.464 --> 03:05.371
In order to paint the detailed work, use a one or two-inch paintbrush.

03:06.088 --> 03:09.094
Dip the paintbrush into the paint and just like the roller,...

03:09.203 --> 03:12.207
...make sure not to overload the brush with too much paint.

03:13.967 --> 03:16.991
Begin painting using long, flowing brush strokes.

03:17.396 --> 03:21.974
Time spent properly masking the room is now saved as you quickly cover the edges of the walls.

03:22.249 --> 03:27.195
Depending on the color of the paint and whether you used primer, you may only need one coat.

03:27.380 --> 03:30.009
However, you often need to apply two coats...

03:30.087 --> 03:32.894
...to obtain full wall coverage and give the best finish.

03:33.303 --> 03:35.759
Step six: Remove the masking tape.

03:36.173 --> 03:39.598
When the wall is nearly dry, carefully remove the masking tape.

03:40.276 --> 03:44.918
The best way to know when it's time to remove the tape is to touch a bit of paint on it.

03:45.486 --> 03:48.079
It should feel tacky but not sticky to your finger.

03:48.749 --> 03:50.770
Carefully begin to remove the tape.

03:51.012 --> 03:55.847
If you find that any paint has leaked underneath, then use a damp sponge to remove the paint.

03:56.524 --> 03:59.462
Now, gently refit the light switches and outlet covers.

04:01.116 --> 04:03.156
Now stand back and admire your work.
