Is it possible to scare off a shark?

00:05.909 --> 00:06.295
The ocean,...

00:06.914 --> 00:09.430
...teeming with life and home to millions of fish,...

00:09.566 --> 00:12.371
...Sea-Monkeys and a fascinating array of sewage and waste.

00:12.845 --> 00:17.343
Yet in these waters dwells one of the most terrifying predators of all: the shark.

00:18.332 --> 00:21.034
Although you're more likely to be hit by lightning than attacked by a shark,...

00:21.731 --> 00:25.505
...lightning isn't six man-eating meters long with hundreds of serrated teeth.

00:26.076 --> 00:28.279
So it's best to know how to protect yourself.

00:28.906 --> 00:30.861
Your first instinct will be to swim away.

00:31.166 --> 00:35.024
And if the distance between you and the shark is great enough, this would be your best bet.

00:35.576 --> 00:37.925
But if it doesn't occur to you to swim away from danger,...

00:38.029 --> 00:40.153
...I would recommend a life spent on dry land.

00:40.971 --> 00:45.069
While swimming near a shark, use smooth strokes because excessive splashing...

00:45.157 --> 00:48.172
...will attract your predator's attention and make you look like food.

00:48.478 --> 00:50.015
Delicious, flailing food.

00:50.645 --> 00:53.995
But if you're too close to escape, some recommend that you swim towards the shark.

00:54.619 --> 00:57.603
This won't likely scare the shark but it will signal aggression.

00:57.879 --> 00:59.000
Sharks respect power.

00:59.753 --> 01:03.408
If that doesn't work, when the predator gets within reach, hit the shark in the nose,...

01:03.767 --> 01:06.809
...taking great care to avoid the massive deadly jaw, of course.

01:07.327 --> 01:11.384
Also, try to claw its eyes and gills, these are the shark's most sensitive areas.

01:11.875 --> 01:17.051
But if all else fails, hands down the number one fail-proof sure-fire way to scare off a shark is...
