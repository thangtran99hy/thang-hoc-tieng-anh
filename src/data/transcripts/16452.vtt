Hello!

00:09.284 --> 00:09.998
How much do you want?

00:10.520 --> 00:12.902
Then, what's your final price? Okay?

00:13.738 --> 00:14.415
I'll give you 20.

00:14.685 --> 00:15.760
Pretty impossible!

00:16.605 --> 00:17.984
Why are you so stingy?

00:18.262 --> 00:19.289
What's your last price?

00:19.374 --> 00:20.032
I'll give you 20.

00:20.175 --> 00:21.009
A little bit more.

00:21.859 --> 00:22.787
Are you wanting to kill me?

00:22.865 --> 00:24.541
For just the price of 25.

00:25.336 --> 00:26.112
Okay, I'll take the money.

00:26.583 --> 00:27.771
Why are you very cheap?

00:30.111 --> 00:31.459
Welcome to the Silk Market.

00:40.667 --> 00:43.066
Ten percent of the asking cost, usually.

00:43.303 --> 00:45.878
If you go to one place and you give them a price and it's too low,...

00:45.984 --> 00:49.353
...you just go to the next because there's definitely stores that, they all have the same thing.

00:49.647 --> 00:50.455
Just keep going lower.

00:50.533 --> 00:52.250
Sometimes, you got to play them against each other.

00:52.340 --> 00:55.906
So if it's too low, you just go to the next. Raise your price by five kwai and start over.

00:56.001 --> 00:57.087
Stand your ground.

00:57.357 --> 01:02.660
Start extremely low and always tell them to give you a better price, and always walk away.

01:02.816 --> 01:04.711
And if they don't like it, then you just go to the next.

01:04.891 --> 01:06.265
And you can just keep going and going.

01:06.413 --> 01:09.284
Walking away is the key to winning any victory.

01:11.300 --> 01:12.585
I want to make friends with you.

01:12.662 --> 01:13.997
Don't look around, don't walk around.

01:14.430 --> 01:15.785
I'll sell to you at this price, okay?

01:17.181 --> 01:17.660
How much?

01:17.956 --> 01:18.642
For this shirt?

01:18.729 --> 01:20.125
Yes. That's good quality.

01:20.217 --> 01:23.420
You can machine-wash it and your wife can handwash it also.

01:24.259 --> 01:25.090
For how much do you want to buy it?

01:26.250 --> 01:27.365
I don't even want this shirt.

01:27.472 --> 01:28.787
But if you want it, how much?

01:29.757 --> 01:31.033
Don't joke with me, okay?

01:31.663 --> 01:33.063
Are you feverish?

01:37.069 --> 01:38.589
I think you feel very hot.

01:38.711 --> 01:41.270
If you give me that, I'll give you that, an even worse number.

01:46.481 --> 01:46.949
Are you okay?

01:47.325 --> 01:48.623
Yeah, are you okay too?

01:49.268 --> 01:50.160
Just a little bit more.

01:51.569 --> 01:54.413
Just a little bit more, a little bit.

01:55.326 --> 01:55.923
Are you being fair with me?

01:56.033 --> 01:57.693
That would cut my work cut from here!

01:58.225 --> 01:58.836
You're a hard sell.

01:59.397 --> 02:01.045
What's your maximum?

02:01.335 --> 02:04.262
You already gave me the last final price and it was way too much.

02:04.341 --> 02:06.665
Okay, this can be your last price.

02:06.909 --> 02:07.797
What's your last price?

02:08.171 --> 02:08.959
What's your last price?

02:09.057 --> 02:09.834
Final, final.

02:09.943 --> 02:10.431
Okay, 70.

02:10.805 --> 02:11.016
No.

02:11.237 --> 02:11.641
75?

02:11.895 --> 02:12.098
No.

02:12.275 --> 02:12.966
Okay, give me your money.
