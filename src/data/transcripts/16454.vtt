00:08.293 --> 00:13.090
Many years ago, after I graduated from business school, I decided to take a vacation.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.740
I chose a small, quiet fishing village...

00:15.865 --> 00:19.241
...where I thought I'd be able to take my mind off of business, if only for a few days.

00:21.199 --> 00:25.678
Walking along the beach just before sunset, I saw a small fishing boat coming to shore.

00:26.516 --> 00:30.101
Inside the boat were a lone fisherman and several beautiful yellowfin tuna.

00:32.730 --> 00:34.744
"How long did it take you to catch those fish?" I asked.

00:35.405 --> 00:37.036
"Only a couple of hours," he replied.

00:37.879 --> 00:40.008
"Why don't you stay out a bit longer and catch more?" I asked.

00:40.397 --> 00:43.539
"Certainly there must be a demand for more fish than the few I saw in the boat?"

00:44.361 --> 00:49.477
The fisherman smiled, "I catch enough to support my family and I live a full and busy life."

00:49.934 --> 00:51.066
"I rise with the sun,..."

00:51.922 --> 00:52.549
"...fish a little,..."

00:53.211 --> 00:54.208
"...play with my daughters,..."

00:54.792 --> 00:56.218
"...have lunch with my family...

00:57.027 --> 01:00.481
...and then teach children how to fish before I stroll into the village each evening,..."

01:00.877 --> 01:03.447
"...where I sip wine and play guitar with my wife and friends."

01:04.093 --> 01:09.189
"Listen," I said. "I have an MBA. I can help you vastly expand your business."

01:09.425 --> 01:11.429
"If you would simply spend more time fishing,...

01:11.746 --> 01:14.019
...you would soon earn enough money to buy a bigger boat."

01:15.018 --> 01:16.454
"Really?" questioned the fisherman.

01:16.817 --> 01:18.985
"Absolutely, and with a bigger boat...

01:19.282 --> 01:22.444
...you would soon catch enough fish to buy several boats, then a whole fleet."

01:23.205 --> 01:26.137
"At that point, you would be big enough to sell your fish directly to a processor."

01:26.628 --> 01:29.410
"...cutting out the middleman and greatly increasing your profits."

01:30.391 --> 01:32.723
The fisherman raised an eyebrow, "Hmm."

01:33.811 --> 01:36.533
"Eventually, you could open your own cannery and control the product,...

01:36.679 --> 01:39.153
...the processing, and the distribution," I added.

01:39.710 --> 01:40.723
"Then what?" he asked.

01:41.399 --> 01:43.873
"You then relocate your operations to the capital."

01:44.216 --> 01:45.129
"And if all goes well,...

01:45.241 --> 01:48.971
...you will likely find yourself in New York City in control of a rapidly expanding empire."

01:49.877 --> 01:51.710
"How long would all of this take?" He asked.

01:51.991 --> 01:56.502
Clearly following my logic, "Oh, probably between 10 and 15 years." I replied.

01:57.169 --> 01:57.953
"And then what?"

01:58.519 --> 02:02.686
"Well, that's the best part. You would announce an IPO and sell stock to the public."

02:03.109 --> 02:06.029
"At that point my friend, you would be very, very rich:..."

02:06.349 --> 02:07.883
"...a millionaire many times over."

02:09.287 --> 02:12.653
The fisherman paused, "Really? A millionaire. Then what?"

02:13.284 --> 02:15.344
"What do you mean?" I answered a bit surprised.

02:16.057 --> 02:18.026
"I mean, what would I do if I were a millionaire?"

02:18.983 --> 02:21.451
"What kind of question is that? Whatever you like of course."

02:21.941 --> 02:23.018
"I imagine you would retire,...

02:23.609 --> 02:26.704
...move to a small coastal fishing village where you would rise with the sun,..."

02:27.532 --> 02:29.987
"...fish a little, play with your granddaughters,..."

02:30.119 --> 02:33.333
"...have lunch with your family, and then teach children...

02:33.454 --> 02:35.919
...how to fish before strolling into the village each evening..."

02:36.299 --> 02:39.036
"...where you would sip wine and play guitar with your wife and friends."

02:39.549 --> 02:43.939
The fisherman smiled and without saying another word, began to build a small fire.

02:44.638 --> 02:48.686
We shared the taste of the delicious fish and watched the sun go down over the ocean...

02:49.131 --> 02:51.874
...as the sound of guitars rose from the village nearby.
