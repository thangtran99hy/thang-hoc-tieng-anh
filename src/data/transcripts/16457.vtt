00:01.771 --> 00:03.451
Why can't I tickle myself?

00:06.479 --> 00:08.125
There are actually two types of tickle.

00:08.389 --> 00:12.353
The first, knismesis, is a sensation of something moving lightly across your skin.

00:12.768 --> 00:15.083
You can imagine why this sort of neurological alert...

00:15.213 --> 00:17.477
...might be useful from an evolutionary standpoint.

00:18.172 --> 00:21.373
You can intentionally induce this sensation with a feather on your arm...

00:21.625 --> 00:23.607
...or by touching the roof of your mouth with your finger.

00:24.203 --> 00:26.910
Though many species are susceptible to this type of tickling,...

00:27.109 --> 00:30.785
...primates including humans show another more fascinating tickle sensation.

00:31.577 --> 00:35.053
Gargalesis is a more direct tickle aimed at sensitive parts of your body...

00:35.262 --> 00:37.125
...like your ribs, armpits or feet.

00:38.011 --> 00:40.631
Sometimes this type of tickling was used as a form of torture.

00:41.714 --> 00:44.367
Gargalesis is dependent on the element of surprise.

00:44.887 --> 00:47.415
Recent studies have shown that if you try to tickle yourself,...

00:47.569 --> 00:50.581
...the cerebellum, an area of the brain integral to locomotion,...

00:50.965 --> 00:56.247
...sends signals to the cortex anticipating the resulting sensations and telling you to ignore them.

00:56.603 --> 01:00.587
However, if someone else tickles us, our brain registers surprise and alarm.

01:00.978 --> 01:02.373
Perhaps we evolved this mechanism...

01:02.439 --> 01:06.693
...to distinguish harmless self-inflicted touches from potentially dangerous stimuli.

01:06.959 --> 01:11.301
But ultimately, if you want to experience a true tickle sensation, get off the Internet.

01:11.515 --> 01:14.833
Stop trying to tickle yourself and find someone nice enough to do it for you.
