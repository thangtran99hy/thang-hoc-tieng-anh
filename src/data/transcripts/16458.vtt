Welcome to "American Talk," the only talk show devoted to teaching strange foreigners...

00:04.645 --> 00:06.592
...how to speak the right way, the American way.

00:06.884 --> 00:10.173
My guests today, Daniel Radcliffe and the cast of Harry Potter.

00:10.833 --> 00:11.361
Awesome.

00:15.233 --> 00:17.569
Emma, I'm gonna give you a few phrases and I wanna hear your best.

00:17.657 --> 00:18.102
Okay.

00:18.244 --> 00:18.943
US, American.

00:19.188 --> 00:20.433
I'm really feeling the pressure.

00:20.525 --> 00:22.833
I feel like this is an audition or something. Okay, go.

00:23.123 --> 00:24.207
The olive garden.

00:24.466 --> 00:24.841
The what?

00:30.531 --> 00:33.423
Do I have to say this one? Glenn Beck.

00:33.621 --> 00:34.984
Glenn, Glenn Beck.

00:35.097 --> 00:36.213
Charlie Sheen.

00:36.427 --> 00:37.139
Glenn Beck.

00:37.223 --> 00:39.847
What? Why do you got Glenn Beck and Charlie Sheen on the same list?

00:39.947 --> 00:40.737
That's what Americans say.

00:40.875 --> 00:41.339
Okay!

00:42.785 --> 00:43.427
Booyah.

00:43.900 --> 00:44.561
Booyah.

00:44.741 --> 00:45.347
Booyah.

00:45.430 --> 00:46.809
Do you really say "booyah"?

00:46.875 --> 00:48.289
I do. That's an American statement.

00:48.371 --> 00:50.107
Really? Okay. All right, I'm going to learn that one.

00:50.190 --> 00:50.690
Booyah.

00:50.784 --> 00:51.189
Booyah.

00:51.297 --> 00:52.735
What the hell are these places? Are they restaurants?

00:52.884 --> 00:55.231
Hey buddy, can I get an order of mozzarella sticks please?

00:55.476 --> 01:00.061

01:04.811 --> 01:07.485
Hey buddy. Man, can I get an order of mozzarella sticks please?

01:07.585 --> 01:08.407
Sold. You're hired.

01:08.559 --> 01:08.889
Yeah.

01:08.971 --> 01:09.199
Two more.

01:09.346 --> 01:09.780
You'd hire me?

01:09.846 --> 01:11.061
Justin Bieber is the man.

01:11.173 --> 01:12.995
Justin Bieber is the man.

01:13.109 --> 01:17.102
Oh man! Justin Bieber, he is the man. Booyah!

01:17.303 --> 01:18.643
My apologies in advance, Rob.

01:18.790 --> 01:19.967
I'm just reading what's on the card.

01:20.075 --> 01:20.953
I'm just following orders.

01:22.124 --> 01:22.962
"Twilight" blows.

01:24.493 --> 01:26.885
Oh, this is controversial.

01:27.123 --> 01:28.109
This is a trick!

01:28.452 --> 01:29.705
You are trying to trick me!

01:29.818 --> 01:30.859
"Twilight" blows.

01:30.973 --> 01:31.931
So, what language do you speak?

01:32.107 --> 01:32.717
I speak American.

01:32.789 --> 01:35.289
You speak American? For some reason, I thought it was English.

01:35.377 --> 01:37.339
No, no, no. It's the freedom language.
