00:01.623 --> 00:03.979
Can there be lightning with no rain or thunder?

00:06.023 --> 00:09.915
Ah, the good old days, when lightning was nothing more than Zeus meting out judgment...

00:10.023 --> 00:13.221
...in the form of deadly bolts hurled from atop Mount Olympus.

00:13.408 --> 00:17.369
Fortunately, the advent of modern science allows us to understand and appreciate lightning...

00:17.595 --> 00:19.609
...without all those messy animal sacrifices.

00:20.367 --> 00:23.590
As droplets of moisture move within a cloud, they collide with one another.

00:23.969 --> 00:28.517
This builds up negative charges at the cloud's base which repels electrons on the ground below.

00:29.051 --> 00:32.521
So the earth beneath the cloud takes on an opposing positive charge.

00:32.989 --> 00:37.472
And since opposites attract, a spark jumps between the positive and negative charges.

00:38.367 --> 00:41.820
This spark can heat the air to more than 10,000 degrees Celsius.

00:42.179 --> 00:44.061
That's hotter than the surface of the sun.

00:44.678 --> 00:49.074
This superheated air expands rapidly resulting in a sound wave we call thunder,...

00:49.377 --> 00:52.401
...which like a tree falling in the woods when no one is around,...

00:52.814 --> 00:55.740
...still makes a sound despite what your philosophy teacher says.

00:56.295 --> 00:59.558
Thunder usually only travels 16 to 24 kilometers.

00:59.770 --> 01:02.634
But lightning can be seen for up to 160 kilometers.

01:02.834 --> 01:04.810
You can see lightning and not hear thunder,...

01:05.077 --> 01:08.305
...but that just means you are too far away to hear it, not that the thunder is absent.

01:08.903 --> 01:10.995
A layer of warm air between the clouds and the ground...

01:11.145 --> 01:13.683
...will sometimes evaporate the rain before it can fall.

01:14.069 --> 01:17.521
This is called a dry thunderstorm, a common cause of wildfires.

01:18.027 --> 01:21.708
So you can most definitely see lightning even when it isn't raining.

01:21.884 --> 01:24.115
But we still don't recommend golfing on those days.

01:24.398 --> 01:25.308
Zeus hates golfers.
