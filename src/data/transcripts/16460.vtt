00:00.025 --> 00:03.708
It's an honor to be here to come and say a final goodbye.

00:04.655 --> 00:16.314
I grew up in the South, and Rosa Parks was a hero to me long before I recognized and understood the power and impact that her life embodied.

00:16.760 --> 00:23.819
I remember my father telling me about this colored woman who had refused to give up her seat.

00:24.967 --> 00:28.855
And in my child's mind, I thought, "She must be really big."

00:31.471 --> 00:34.333
I thought she must be at least a hundred feet tall.

00:35.137 --> 00:41.941
I imagined her being stalwart and strong and carrying a shield to hold back the white folks.

00:43.503 --> 00:47.211
And then I grew up and had the esteemed honor of meeting her.

00:47.287 --> 00:49.977
And wasn't that a surprise.

00:50.571 --> 01:01.445
Here was this petite, almost delicate lady who was the personification of grace and goodness.

01:02.005 --> 01:03.349
And I thanked her then.

01:03.427 --> 01:13.454
I said, "Thank you," for myself and for every colored girl, every colored boy, who didn't have heroes who were celebrated.

01:13.565 --> 01:14.563
I thanked her then.

01:18.465 --> 01:28.213
And after our first meeting I realized that God uses good people to do great things.

01:29.322 --> 01:33.714
And I'm here today to say a final thank you, sister Rosa,...

01:34.507 --> 01:40.796
...for being a great woman who used your life to serve, to serve us all.

01:41.524 --> 01:45.306
That day that you refused to give up your seat on the bus,...

01:46.049 --> 01:54.739
...you, sister Rosa, changed the trajectory of my life and the lives of so many other people in the world.

01:55.363 --> 02:05.812
I would not be standing here today nor standing where I stand every day had she not chosen to sit down.

02:11.499 --> 02:11.993
I know that.

02:13.727 --> 02:14.319
I know that.

02:17.865 --> 02:19.875
I know that, and I honor that.

02:20.311 --> 02:25.542
Had she not chosen to say we shall not, we shall not be moved.

02:25.923 --> 02:33.681
So I thank you again, sister Rosa, for not only confronting the one white man whose seat you took,...

02:34.979 --> 02:37.033
...not only confronting the bus driver,...

02:37.893 --> 02:42.659
...not only for confronting the law, but for confronting history,...

02:43.502 --> 02:53.707
...a history that for 400 years said that you were not even worthy of a glance, certainly no consideration.

02:54.050 --> 02:56.197
I thank you for not moving.

02:56.589 --> 03:00.857
And in that moment when you resolved to stay in that seat,...

03:01.461 --> 03:06.772
...you reclaimed your humanity and you gave us all back a piece of our own.

03:07.465 --> 03:08.554
I thank you for that.

03:10.377 --> 03:12.584
I thank you for acting without concern.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.365
I often thought about what that took,...

03:15.857 --> 03:23.670
...knowing the climate of the times and what could have happened to you, what it took to stay seated.

03:23.980 --> 03:28.397
You acted without concern for yourself and made life better for us all.

03:28.685 --> 03:30.363
We shall not be moved.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.374
I marvel at your will.

03:32.753 --> 03:35.073
I celebrate your strength to this day.

03:35.514 --> 03:40.154
And I am forever grateful, sister Rosa, for your courage, your conviction.

03:40.824 --> 03:43.545
I owe you to succeed.

03:46.916 --> 03:48.444
I will not be moved.
