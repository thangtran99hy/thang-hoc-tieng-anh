There's a fine line between being a hopeless romantic and just being hopeless.

00:11.560 --> 00:14.273
These tips will help keep you on this side of cheesy.

00:14.938 --> 00:17.272
You will need insight into your partner,...

00:17.555 --> 00:21.775
...cliche avoidance, writing skills and an act of kindness.

00:22.515 --> 00:23.325
Step one.

00:23.686 --> 00:27.815
Know your partner's tastes, especially when it comes to public displays of affection.

00:28.539 --> 00:33.157
What's hopelessly romantic to one person is mortifyingly cheesy to another.

00:34.105 --> 00:36.731
Step two. Avoid cliches.

00:37.496 --> 00:41.773
If your romantic gesture is a staple of bodice-ripping novels and bad romcoms,...

00:41.863 --> 00:44.380
...it's probably more cheesy than romantic.

00:45.555 --> 00:46.410
Step three.

00:46.774 --> 00:51.869
Unless you're a professional singer-songwriter, don't write your love a song.

00:52.447 --> 00:55.919
Insipid lyrics, out of tune singing, one-note guitar strumming?

00:56.248 --> 00:58.020
They haven't got time for the cheese.

00:58.497 --> 01:03.286
Step four. Do try your hand at writing your sweetie a love letter on real paper.

01:03.773 --> 01:07.523
To make it romantic without being cheesy, keep it simple and straightforward.

01:08.063 --> 01:11.300
Don't compare their lips to rubies or their eyes to diamonds.

01:11.660 --> 01:13.757
Just tell them honestly why you love them.

01:15.515 --> 01:19.086
If you write them a love poem, make sure it doesn't rhyme.

01:19.599 --> 01:23.747
Step five. When it comes to gifts, treat your lover like a grown-up.

01:24.419 --> 01:28.624
If the present is something a five-year-old would enjoy, it's cheesy, not romantic.

01:29.695 --> 01:33.737
Step six. Do something nice for them that makes their day a little brighter...

01:33.827 --> 01:35.199
...or their life a little easier.

01:35.699 --> 01:39.283
Sometimes, just being kind is the most romantic gesture of all.

01:40.082 --> 01:44.420
Did you know? Honolulu was voted the most romantic city in the United States...

01:44.728 --> 01:47.780
...and Dallas-Fort Worth was voted the least romantic.
