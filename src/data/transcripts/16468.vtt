Large organizations, whether they're technology companies or government bureaucracies...

00:22.851 --> 00:27.435
...or other kinds of companies, large organizations have a logic all their own.

00:27.966 --> 00:31.289
They are vast bureaucracies.

00:31.653 --> 00:31.897
Yeah.

00:32.163 --> 00:38.047
And so, the only way you can change the direction of a vast organization...

00:39.006 --> 00:42.267
...is to be systematic and systemic about it.

00:42.541 --> 00:48.740
What I mean is, it is a system's effort that involves strategy, goal setting,...

00:49.034 --> 00:52.691
...how you structure the organization, what processes you put in place...

00:52.773 --> 00:54.886
...to guide people's work and their behavior,...

00:55.273 --> 01:02.155
...how do you measure and reward progress, how do you celebrate that progress,...

01:02.655 --> 01:05.300
...what's the culture, what's the leadership behavior,...

01:05.445 --> 01:09.728
...all of those things together are what I would call the leadership system.

01:10.225 --> 01:17.220
But it requires a systemic, systematic approach carried out over many months and many years.

01:17.572 --> 01:22.447
Not a flash in the pan and one big communications rally and we're all off to the races.

01:22.831 --> 01:24.939
How do you plan for a cultural revolution?

01:25.359 --> 01:29.211
So, a big merger requires a changing culture. It doesn't happen overnight.

01:29.612 --> 01:32.489
So, perhaps you can talk more along the cultural challenges.

01:32.966 --> 01:35.287
Well, cultural change doesn't happen overnight...

01:35.394 --> 01:39.390
...and it doesn't happen by accident or by serendipity.

01:39.505 --> 01:41.400
In other words, you have to plan for it.

01:41.532 --> 01:44.751
Just as you would plan for rolling out a new product.

01:45.139 --> 01:46.360
So, what does that mean?

01:46.760 --> 01:50.064
That means you have to have a very clear sense of what you're trying to create...

01:50.152 --> 01:53.014
...and you have to have a very clear action plan...

01:53.100 --> 01:55.625
...for how you're gonna get from where you are to where you wanna be.

01:56.179 --> 02:00.671
In the case of the Compaq merger, we went through a process called cultural due diligence.

02:01.079 --> 02:03.073
You know, you go through technical due diligence,...

02:03.151 --> 02:06.413
...you go through financial due diligence, we went through cultural due diligence.

02:07.007 --> 02:12.085
And what that meant was we identified what were the key differences between these two cultures,...

02:12.628 --> 02:15.079
...what were the similarities that we could build upon?

02:15.419 --> 02:18.600
Turns out the values people wanted the company to represent...

02:19.145 --> 02:23.195
...were a source of commonality and provided a foundation.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.417
And there were some key differences and we said,...

02:25.485 --> 02:28.141
"...You know, those differences are things we're not gonna paper over,...

02:28.409 --> 02:30.180
...we're not gonna pretend they don't exist."

02:30.641 --> 02:33.713
"We're going to examine them, we're going to leverage them where we can..."

02:33.849 --> 02:33.953
Right.

02:34.315 --> 02:36.066
"...and we're gonna talk about them explicitly."

02:36.293 --> 02:39.923
So you have to do it in a planned way, a systematic way, a detailed way.
