Whitney Houston, one of the biggest stars in pop music has died in Beverly Hills...

00:07.541 --> 00:12.016
...one day before the music industry's biggest celebration, the Grammy Awards.

00:12.330 --> 00:15.131
Police received the 9-1-1 call Saturday afternoon.

00:15.440 --> 00:17.949
Efforts to revive the singer were not successful.

00:18.295 --> 00:20.559
She died at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.

00:20.786 --> 00:25.839
When our officers arrived in the hotel room on the fourth floor,...

00:26.408 --> 00:31.448
...fire department and hotel security were already attempting resuscitation measures.

00:31.777 --> 00:37.435
At 3:55 pm this afternoon, Whitney Houston was pronounced dead...

00:37.599 --> 00:38.951
...at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.

00:40.195 --> 00:43.097
From the mid-1980s to the late 1990s,...

00:43.329 --> 00:47.051
...the multi-Grammy Award winner was one of the world's best-selling artists.

00:47.379 --> 00:50.542
But her majestic voice and her regal image took a tumble.

00:50.927 --> 00:53.691
Her marriage to singer Bobby Brown was tumultuous,...

00:54.007 --> 00:57.328
...her behavior became erratic and album sales plummeted.

00:57.741 --> 01:01.510
Houston confessed to abusing cocaine, marijuana, and pills.

01:01.801 --> 01:04.323
The cause of death remains under investigation.

01:04.755 --> 01:06.558
Our detectives are going to follow up on this...

01:06.689 --> 01:13.112
...and the first thing to determine is whether or not it was natural causes or some other cause of death.

01:15.608 --> 01:21.526
Houston's death is certain to cast a pall over Sunday's Grammy Awards ceremony where she once reigned.

01:22.117 --> 01:26.605
I'm speechless. My hero is gone.

01:27.154 --> 01:30.403
Oh my God! I don't really have words.

01:30.520 --> 01:35.545
I mean, she was a huge part of me growing up like, you know, I loved her music.

01:35.667 --> 01:37.210
It was so emotional, so soulful.

01:37.543 --> 01:39.387
Houston's success went beyond music...

01:39.735 --> 01:43.853
...and she starred in films including "The Bodyguard" and "Waiting to Exhale."

01:44.126 --> 01:46.021
Whitney Houston was 48.
