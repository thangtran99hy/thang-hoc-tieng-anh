00:00.117 --> 00:00.546
I want it...

00:00.627 --> 00:02.407
...and I would love to have the first one.

00:02.640 --> 00:04.831
I'm so sorry Mr. Seinfeld but you're number two on the list.

00:05.011 --> 00:05.735
Who's number one?

00:05.893 --> 00:06.216
That guy.

00:06.297 --> 00:06.808
Okay.

00:08.989 --> 00:10.565
So, you're number one.

00:11.079 --> 00:11.213
Yeah.

00:12.310 --> 00:14.841
How would you like to be number 20?

00:17.430 --> 00:18.317
I'll throw in the Soup Nazi.

00:18.639 --> 00:19.125
Soup for you.

00:20.658 --> 00:21.507
I own all the characters.

00:23.461 --> 00:24.355
Last living munchkin.

00:24.953 --> 00:25.953
I thought he passed away.

00:26.467 --> 00:27.307
I found another one.

00:28.220 --> 00:29.236
Dancing holographic monkey?

00:30.103 --> 00:30.461
I have one.

00:31.912 --> 00:33.605
I'll make small talk with the omelet guy for you.

00:36.468 --> 00:37.476
Do you ever take an egg home with you?

00:37.861 --> 00:39.785
Is your head that shape underneath the hat?

00:40.284 --> 00:43.797
Do you ever feel bad about coming out of the toilet and then coming right back to work here?

00:44.441 --> 00:45.029
Nobody knows it.

00:45.274 --> 00:45.684
You do.

00:46.481 --> 00:46.985
Yams?

00:47.057 --> 00:48.345
Anybody like dirty limericks?

00:48.584 --> 00:48.995
Yams?

00:49.076 --> 00:50.315
Nobody wants any yams, sweetheart.

00:50.447 --> 00:51.690
Beat it, I'm trying to get a roll going.

00:53.621 --> 00:57.276
I'll recap last week's episode of Jersey Gangland for you with sock puppets!

00:58.225 --> 00:59.121
Manicotti is dead.

00:59.497 --> 01:00.899
I run the Boardwalk now.

01:01.737 --> 01:02.493
He's still here?

01:03.020 --> 01:03.483
Yes.

01:05.479 --> 01:06.459
Sorry, that's a bad idea.

01:07.464 --> 01:08.503
How about a new boat?

01:11.672 --> 01:12.400
Final offer.

01:12.831 --> 01:15.653
For the record, I don't think I like you quite as much as I did at the beginning.

01:15.818 --> 01:16.327
I'm listening.

01:17.053 --> 01:20.396
Access to my personal network of Manhattan zip-line!

01:23.601 --> 01:25.519
Wow! Impressive!

01:26.093 --> 01:27.990
You got the first Acura NSX.

01:28.405 --> 01:30.253
How about a jetpack flying squirrel suit?

01:30.394 --> 01:32.059
New York to LA, twenty minutes!

01:32.649 --> 01:32.926
Sorry, Jerry!

01:43.051 --> 01:44.306
The Acura NSX.

01:45.164 --> 01:45.868
It's coming.

01:47.664 --> 01:48.271
Leno.

01:48.729 --> 01:51.475
All right, can we talk about something else?
