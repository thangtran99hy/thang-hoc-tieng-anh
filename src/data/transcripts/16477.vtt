00:00.047 --> 00:02.153
And there's the favorite, Silver Prince.

00:02.234 --> 00:04.291
So we have a late entry named Mr. Quiggly.

00:04.398 --> 00:06.017
Is he wearing running shoes?

00:06.109 --> 00:07.585
It is legal, I believe.

00:07.843 --> 00:08.455
And they're off!

00:08.890 --> 00:11.481
It's Queen's Hurricane up front, Silver Prince on his heels.

00:11.685 --> 00:13.991
But wait, Mr. Quiggly is coming around outside!

00:14.202 --> 00:15.493
Look at our new guy go.

00:15.593 --> 00:17.557
And it's got to be Quiggly.

00:18.435 --> 00:18.866
What?

00:19.202 --> 00:19.917
Let's do it.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.861
He's moonwalking in towards the finish line!

00:24.949 --> 00:26.732
The new Midfoot Strike Sketchers Go Run.

00:26.908 --> 00:28.041
Go like never before.

00:28.436 --> 00:29.830
What do you mean you want a new contract?
