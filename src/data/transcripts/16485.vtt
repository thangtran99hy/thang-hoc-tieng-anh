00:00.903 --> 00:02.081
I'm not sure what it is.

00:02.952 --> 00:04.081
I guess I'll be okay.

00:05.953 --> 00:07.260
I'm calling the studio, Matthew.

00:07.371 --> 00:08.197
You're not shooting today.

00:08.636 --> 00:10.746
No, people are depending on me.

00:11.216 --> 00:12.924
Movies bring so much joy.

00:13.282 --> 00:15.314
Stop, it's done. Just get some rest.

00:16.323 --> 00:17.134

00:20.351 --> 00:22.448
How can I handle work on a day like today.

00:23.817 --> 00:24.351
Front desk.

00:24.741 --> 00:26.723
Hi, can I get my CR-V brought up, please?

00:27.517 --> 00:28.721
I've got a lot to do today.

00:29.086 --> 00:30.978
You have excellent taste in automobiles.

00:35.179 --> 00:37.115
Life is packed with things you have to do.

00:37.693 --> 00:39.380
But sometimes you gotta live a little.

00:41.259 --> 00:42.322
Calm yourself woman.

01:02.915 --> 01:03.932
How could I resist?

01:04.908 --> 01:06.123
Look, I don't know what to tell you.

01:06.372 --> 01:06.839
He's sick.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.303
Actors get sick sometimes.

01:15.068 --> 01:15.504
Thanks.

01:15.980 --> 01:16.939
Have a good night.

01:17.815 --> 01:19.119
I've said it before and I'll say it again.

01:19.558 --> 01:20.871
Life moves pretty fast.

01:21.182 --> 01:23.812
If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.

01:26.627 --> 01:30.094
Get going in the all new CR-V from Honda.
