If you wanna know how to decide if a career opportunity is a good one,...

00:03.226 --> 00:05.243
...there are several things you have to take into consideration.

00:05.332 --> 00:07.853
Number 1: Does it make your heart sing?

00:08.334 --> 00:12.028
The number one feedback system that you were given at birth is joy.

00:12.415 --> 00:17.039
If you're not experiencing joy as you think about doing something and as you pursue doing it,...

00:17.447 --> 00:18.958
...then it's off course for you.

00:19.406 --> 00:21.437
You also wanna put your rational mind to work.

00:21.560 --> 00:23.512
You want it to do some due diligence.

00:23.611 --> 00:26.253
Ask other people who've gone down that road before.

00:26.584 --> 00:27.339
What was it like?

00:27.509 --> 00:28.431
What did they have to do?

00:28.756 --> 00:30.524
What were some of the costs of that path?

00:30.825 --> 00:32.609
What were some of the payoffs and the benefits,...

00:33.037 --> 00:35.866
...and really get a sense of what it would be like to do that.

00:36.263 --> 00:38.501
Sometimes, you can go and do an internship...

00:38.589 --> 00:41.871
...or you can work for a friend in their restaurant just to see if you like it,...

00:41.957 --> 00:44.805
...'cause often the fantasy doesn't match the reality.

00:45.049 --> 00:49.092
And the other thing is to simply trust yourself.

00:49.571 --> 00:52.256
You know deep inside what's true for you.

00:52.629 --> 00:55.715
And if you'll take a few minutes and go inside, we call it meditation,...

00:56.091 --> 01:00.026
...and just ask and sit with the question and see what kind of feelings come up.

01:00.355 --> 01:01.187
Does this feel right?

01:01.340 --> 01:03.365
So do all the rational research,...

01:03.818 --> 01:05.843
...but then ultimately bring it back into your heart...

01:06.230 --> 01:08.333
...and decide, "Does this feel good for me?"

01:08.694 --> 01:11.925
And if it makes sense up here and it feels good, then step into it.

01:12.351 --> 01:14.241
Just lean into it and see what happens.

01:14.362 --> 01:14.796
Pursue it.

01:15.485 --> 01:16.836
No decision is forever.

01:17.067 --> 01:19.040
You can always change if it's not what you want.
