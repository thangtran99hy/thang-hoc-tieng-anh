The best way to get the optimum results out of your day is to plan your day the night before.

00:05.451 --> 00:06.511
There are two reasons for this.

00:06.971 --> 00:08.099
Too often during the day,...

00:08.190 --> 00:12.636
...we're just responding to everyone else's needs instead of doing our intended plan.

00:13.009 --> 00:16.149
So if you don't have a plan, you're guaranteed not to be doing what you wanna do.

00:16.221 --> 00:17.864
You'll be responding to other people.

00:18.135 --> 00:21.131
The second reason for planning your day the night before...

00:21.489 --> 00:25.581
...is you can rationally decide what you're going to do at what time of the day.

00:26.060 --> 00:28.155
Too often, people just work from a to-do list.

00:28.625 --> 00:31.608
What you want is to schedule exactly what you're gonna do at what time.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.727
Schedule how long you think it's gonna take.

00:34.105 --> 00:36.223
And by doing it the night before, here's the payoff:...

00:36.627 --> 00:40.117
...all night long, your unconscious and subconscious mind...

00:40.351 --> 00:42.574
...is going to be working on how to make that happen.

00:42.903 --> 00:44.869
It's going to be coming up with creative ideas,...

00:45.197 --> 00:48.566
...pulling information from your past memory into the present so you can utilize it,...

00:49.067 --> 00:51.421
...and literally planning your perfect day.

00:51.612 --> 00:53.862
It's like having an employee working for you all night long.

00:54.213 --> 00:56.304
If you do it in the morning, you don't get that benefit.

00:56.739 --> 00:58.959
And then, start to work your plan.

00:59.138 --> 00:59.878
Plan your life.

01:00.115 --> 01:00.850
Work your plan.

01:01.218 --> 01:02.711
You're gonna be very, very successful.
