00:02.957 --> 00:03.715
It's halftime.

00:06.391 --> 00:07.785
Both teams are in their locker room,...

00:07.895 --> 00:10.853
...discussing what they can do to win this game in the second half.

00:12.961 --> 00:14.567
It's halftime in America, too.

00:16.504 --> 00:18.113
People are out of work and they're hurting.

00:18.636 --> 00:21.409
And they are all wondering what they gonna do to make a comeback.

00:22.095 --> 00:24.387
And we're all scared, because this isn't a game.

00:26.135 --> 00:28.653
The people of Detroit know a little something about this.

00:29.725 --> 00:30.941
They almost lost everything.

00:33.575 --> 00:37.653
But we all pulled together, now Motor City is fighting again.

00:39.421 --> 00:42.549
I've seen a lot of tough eras, a lot of downturns in my life.

00:42.895 --> 00:44.997
And times when we didn't understand each other.

00:45.892 --> 00:48.143
It seems that we've lost our heart at times.

00:48.923 --> 00:54.043
The fog of division, discord and blame made it hard to see what lies ahead.

00:56.218 --> 01:01.692
But after those trials, we all rallied around what was right and acted as one.

01:07.144 --> 01:08.429
Because that's what we do.

01:09.801 --> 01:13.190
We find a way through tough times, and if we can't find a way, then we'll make one.

01:16.927 --> 01:18.425
All that matters now is what's ahead.

01:19.524 --> 01:20.723
How do we come from behind?

01:22.203 --> 01:23.187
How do we come together?

01:24.019 --> 01:24.937
And, how do we win?

01:26.709 --> 01:28.515
Detroit is showing us it can be done.

01:29.554 --> 01:32.859
And, what's true about them is true about all of us.

01:35.016 --> 01:37.161
This country can't be knocked out in one punch.

01:37.578 --> 01:39.468
We get right back up again and when we do,...

01:39.527 --> 01:41.419
...the world is gonna hear the roar of our engines.

01:42.693 --> 01:44.819
Yeah, it's halftime America.

01:45.704 --> 01:47.390
And, our second half is about to begin.
