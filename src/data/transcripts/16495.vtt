00:01.402 --> 00:08.202
Millions of Chinese are picking up American slang, thanks to what's happening in this Washington, D.C. apartment.

00:11.961 --> 00:15.913
Meet Jessica Beinecke, China's newest English language star.

00:16.137 --> 00:21.646
My four friends and I are renting a car and driving to New York City. I'm so excited!

00:22.400 --> 00:25.020
Five days a week, from the comfort of her dining table,...

00:26.159 --> 00:30.063
...the 25-year-old writes, hosts and produces a show called...

00:30.295 --> 00:33.849
..."OMG! Meiyu" or "Oh My Gosh! American English."

00:40.107 --> 00:43.745
In it, she explains idioms and slang to her Chinese viewers.

00:44.127 --> 00:46.710
Beinecke began studying Mandarin as an undergraduate.

00:47.055 --> 00:51.558
In 2006, she enrolled in Middlebury College's intensive language program,...

00:51.863 --> 00:57.296
...and spent the first half of 2007 studying in Beijing and Hangzhou, near Shanghai.

00:57.583 --> 01:02.967
I had the best experience studying Mandarin in mainland China,...

01:03.262 --> 01:05.231
...and studying the culture and everything.

01:05.347 --> 01:08.489
I feel like it was always me talking to young Chinese people.

01:09.095 --> 01:14.939
That was my big goal when I was in China, to make as many friends as I could.

01:15.171 --> 01:21.293
She didn't become a star in China until last August, when she produced a video called "Yucky Gunk."

01:21.493 --> 01:23.973
It was about all the gunk that comes out of your face,...

01:25.332 --> 01:28.691
...and we talked about eye gunk and earwax and boogers.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.177
You have a booger right there.

01:36.551 --> 01:41.855
That video went viral, and has since been viewed more than one-and-a-half million times.

01:42.128 --> 01:43.809
That's never going to be in a textbook.

01:44.573 --> 01:51.050
And so they've sort of, now they see "OMG! Meiyu" as a place where they can go...

01:51.202 --> 01:55.943
...to get the most authentic American English that young people use.

01:56.104 --> 01:56.850
Jiggly.

02:00.047 --> 02:02.525
Jiggly. My arms get jiggly.

02:02.841 --> 02:06.493
Beinecke, or Baijieh as she's known to her Chinese fans,...

02:06.771 --> 02:10.224
...curates six social media accounts in China and the US.

02:10.443 --> 02:12.929
It starts on the weekend, where I ask them,...

02:14.977 --> 02:17.819
...which is, "What do you want to study next week?"

02:18.170 --> 02:20.855
And I get hundreds of responses every week.

02:21.062 --> 02:23.702
"OMG!" is becoming a hit in China.

02:24.105 --> 02:29.116
On the Chinese equivalent of YouTube, "OMG!" has garnered more than seven million views.

02:29.530 --> 02:32.313
And on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter,...

02:32.622 --> 02:36.129
...the program is now followed by more than 200,000 people.

02:36.549 --> 02:38.557
Beinecke's bosses are taking notice.

02:38.979 --> 02:44.352
She works at VOA, "Voice of America," the 70-year-old US government-funded broadcaster...

02:44.465 --> 02:47.381
...with programs in more than 40 languages around the world.

02:47.716 --> 02:49.283
So why is this working?

02:49.612 --> 02:56.851
She talks to them on their level, and I think that's something we need to replicate around VOA.

02:57.071 --> 03:01.760
What Jessica is doing is going to be something that I think you'll see more people doing here,...

03:02.200 --> 03:06.960
...which is reaching out to the younger generation in different countries and communicating with them.

03:07.413 --> 03:12.110
Chinese education has traditionally relied heavily on instructive teaching,...

03:12.363 --> 03:14.467
...lectures and rote memorization.

03:14.797 --> 03:17.732
But until recently, the country's closed history...

03:17.959 --> 03:22.972
...has meant it has lacked foreign-born teachers who could add context and authenticity.

03:23.273 --> 03:28.919
We Chinese often learn English from very formal classes, and it's like very far from our everyday life.

03:29.157 --> 03:39.188
The idioms, expressions and slang that she teaches are not easy to find in traditional textbooks.

03:39.845 --> 03:46.237
And I think those expressions are very useful in our daily lives.

03:46.511 --> 03:52.615
For now, Beinecke continues her conversation with Chinese admirers and pupils half a world away.

03:54.253 --> 03:54.795
Bye bye!
