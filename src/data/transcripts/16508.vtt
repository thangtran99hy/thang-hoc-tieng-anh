00:03.290 --> 00:08.137
On October 29th 2010, Jeremy Lin became the first Chinese-American...

00:08.431 --> 00:10.269
...to play in a regular season NBA game.

00:10.587 --> 00:13.963
The second son of Taiwanese immigrants, Gie-Ming and Shirley Lin,...

00:14.373 --> 00:18.473
...Jeremy learned how to play basketball from his father who was a big NBA fan.

00:19.003 --> 00:22.045
But not everyone in the family thought it was something he should pursue.

00:22.785 --> 00:28.188
No one else really played basketball besides my family and so it was kind of taboo for a little bit and,...

00:28.366 --> 00:33.886
...you know, with my grandma she was kind of always trying to influence me to not play.

00:36.464 --> 00:41.083
And then, you know, once we realized this is something I love doing,...

00:43.758 --> 00:49.535
...I'm having fun doing it and I can go play at the next level then, more people started supporting.

00:50.150 --> 00:55.382
He continued to improve, and in 2006, led Palo Alto High to a 32-1 record...

00:55.787 --> 01:00.073
...and an upset of nationally ranked Mater Dei in the Division 2 state championship game.

01:00.788 --> 01:04.712
Despite being named player of the year by virtually every California publication,...

01:05.110 --> 01:07.328
...he did not receive a single scholarship offer.

01:07.591 --> 01:10.707
I think a lot of it was me being underdeveloped physically.

01:11.239 --> 01:17.447
At that time, I was 170 pounds and I was just very raw.

01:17.853 --> 01:22.762
And then, you know, me being Asian-American, I don't know how much that had to do with it,...

01:22.848 --> 01:25.887
... but I'm sure it had something to do with it.

01:26.113 --> 01:28.477
While Harvard does not provide athletic scholarships,...

01:28.794 --> 01:31.511
...Jeremy was offered a chance to play there and accepted.

01:31.997 --> 01:35.325
He excelled on the court despite having to put up with racist taunts...

01:35.398 --> 01:39.346
...like being told to "Go back to China" and being called a "Chink."

01:39.714 --> 01:42.951
You know, it was just some that got under my skin at the very beginning.

01:44.006 --> 01:48.149
It was really frustrating but I just had to learn how to deal with it...

01:48.245 --> 01:52.990
...as time went by for me to be able to be more mentally strong...

01:53.076 --> 01:56.746
...and not get distracted or angered so easily.

01:57.081 --> 01:59.618
Jeremy was twice named first team all Ivy League.

02:00.138 --> 02:05.001
As the team's leading scorer during the senior season, he led Harvard to its best record ever.

02:05.393 --> 02:08.519
Still, he wasn't taken in the 2010 NBA draft.

02:09.409 --> 02:13.693
Dallas did sign Jeremy to its summer league team and he made the most of his opportunity...

02:13.956 --> 02:17.319
...when he outplayed the overall number one pick, Kentucky's John Wall.

02:17.677 --> 02:21.633
His performance against Wall got him contract offers from the Mavericks and Lakers,...

02:22.042 --> 02:25.563
...but he chose to sign with his hometown team, the Golden State Warriors.

02:26.203 --> 02:30.078
A devout Christian, Jeremy needed his faith to help him deal with the pressure...

02:30.169 --> 02:32.073
...from the media and the Asian community.

02:32.623 --> 02:33.689
Shot clock at five.

02:35.621 --> 02:38.399
Jeremy jumper, Jeremy Lin off the bench!

02:38.699 --> 02:40.447
How good has he been here in this quarter?

02:40.807 --> 02:45.139
So far, the racist remarks he heard in college have not followed him to the NBA.

02:45.952 --> 02:47.677
That's what I was really shocked about.

02:49.481 --> 02:56.797
I don't think I heard one Asian taunt from an opposing fan or player all year actually so...

02:57.803 --> 03:01.231
...I think a lot of other players in the NBA actually went out of their way...

03:01.303 --> 03:04.345
...to say congratulations and different things like that and so...

03:05.823 --> 03:08.899
...I think the NBA, you know, is like a big family.

03:08.984 --> 03:13.213
I think all the guys are friends with each other and for the most part and...

03:13.325 --> 03:19.625
...people respect what other people are doing and so that was really inspiring...

03:19.737 --> 03:22.097
...and a nice change of pace for me.

03:23.030 --> 03:27.759
Jeremy's faith was tested when he was sent down to the Warriors' developmental league team in Reno.

03:28.739 --> 03:30.657
Being as that was another blessing in disguise, you know,...

03:30.735 --> 03:35.753
...I remember when I first got sent down I felt like the world had ended...

03:35.855 --> 03:38.348
...and I was like "No, don't do that. Don't send me down there."

03:39.611 --> 03:41.644
But looking back, it was absolutely necessary.

03:41.753 --> 03:45.501
I took three trips down there and that was the best thing that could happen to me...

03:46.177 --> 03:48.692
...in terms of my development as a player in my first year in the league.

03:49.279 --> 03:53.401
Playing with a renewed confidence, Jeremy finished the season strong with the Warriors.

03:53.802 --> 03:58.081
At 6'3, 200 pounds, he has the size to play point guard in the NBA.

03:58.456 --> 04:00.827
But to get more minutes, he'll need to put in some work.

04:01.452 --> 04:04.892
In just one season, Jeremy has been able to break some old stereotypes...

04:05.171 --> 04:08.807
...about Asian-Americans being unable to play sports at the professional level.

04:09.449 --> 04:11.112
But he knows there will always be doubters.

04:11.324 --> 04:14.616
You know, that's a stereotype that I'm going to have to fight for the rest of my life...

04:14.729 --> 04:17.799
...but I understand that and it's something that I embrace.

04:20.143 --> 04:23.843
The more I can do to break that stereotype, I'd love to do that.
