We tend to assume very often that there's only one way of looking at something.

00:05.229 --> 00:10.060
One of the ways that, as a designer, I often liked to come up with my new ideas...

00:10.136 --> 00:12.026
...is to try and look at the world in different ways.

00:12.091 --> 00:12.967
So we think about a book.

00:13.391 --> 00:16.743
When we first pick it up, we open the front cover and we might look at the contents page...

00:16.849 --> 00:18.685
...to see whether there's anything interesting there for us.

00:19.265 --> 00:22.189
And the contents page is one way of viewing the structure of a book.

00:23.131 --> 00:27.647
Now, what this is behind me is another way of viewing the structure, actually of my book.

00:27.769 --> 00:32.181
And that actually is a mind map of all of the content of "Change by Design".

00:32.925 --> 00:36.712
And every important piece, every chapter, every piece of content...

00:36.783 --> 00:40.466
...is drawn up there and linked together to show the structure.

00:41.063 --> 00:44.932
Doing that helped me think about how I wanted to tell the story.

00:45.234 --> 00:50.166
So it's an illustration of how, when we look at the world differently, we get to new ideas.

00:50.973 --> 00:54.605
It's easy when you hear the word "design" to think it's about what things look like,...

00:54.725 --> 01:01.451
...or how beautiful they are, or the latest style or product in the Museum of Modern Art, or something.

01:02.091 --> 01:08.858
But really, what design thinking is all about is the simple conversion of need into demand,...

01:09.053 --> 01:10.209
...need into a solution.

01:10.552 --> 01:13.517
Any of us who went to business school, actually don't include me,...

01:13.585 --> 01:16.032
...I went to art school, but those people who went to business school...

01:17.112 --> 01:23.456
...were taught many effective techniques for what I would call convergent thinking,...

01:23.843 --> 01:29.759
...which is taking the set of available choices, making, analyzing those choices...

01:29.912 --> 01:32.723
...and making the best one, that then gets implemented.

01:33.136 --> 01:37.483
Now that's great for taking the existing world and optimizing it.

01:38.526 --> 01:41.339
If, on the other hand, you're trying to create new innovations,...

01:41.634 --> 01:43.647
...there's another piece that you need to put in front of that.

01:44.129 --> 01:46.772
And that is the creation of those choices themselves.

01:47.426 --> 01:50.626
Because if you're just looking at the same set of choices that everybody else is looking at...

01:50.943 --> 01:53.023
...you're likely to get to the same innovations that they are.

01:53.638 --> 01:56.783
But if, however, you can create new choices,...

01:56.922 --> 01:59.668
...choices that nobody else is looking at, that nobody else has seen,...

02:00.150 --> 02:04.375
...there's a pretty strong chance you can get to an innovation that nobody else has gone to.

02:04.701 --> 02:07.404
So successful companies innovate across a portfolio.

02:07.587 --> 02:11.575
They do short-term incremental innovation, they do medium-term innovation,...

02:11.872 --> 02:15.520
...and they do kind of long-term or breakthrough innovation.

02:16.225 --> 02:20.019
And one of the tricks is applying your resources, the people,...

02:20.093 --> 02:23.488
...the money you have appropriately across that range.
