My big idea is a very, very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas...

00:24.557 --> 00:27.582
...that are at the moment dormant inside us.

00:27.962 --> 00:31.396
And my little idea that will do that is sleep.

00:37.603 --> 00:40.201
This is a room of type A women.

00:42.101 --> 00:44.890
This is a room of sleep-deprived women.

00:47.089 --> 00:50.437
And I learned the hard way the value of sleep.

00:51.261 --> 00:54.061
Two and a half years ago, I fainted from exhaustion.

00:54.421 --> 00:56.113
I hit my head on my desk.

00:56.210 --> 00:59.713
I broke my cheekbone. I got five stitches on my right eye.

01:00.423 --> 01:04.716
And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep.

01:06.229 --> 01:11.719
And in the course of that, I studied, I met with medical doctors, scientists,...

01:11.847 --> 01:17.615
and I'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive, more inspired,...

01:17.911 --> 01:20.966
...more joyful life is getting enough sleep.

01:26.945 --> 01:32.742
And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution, this new feminist issue.

01:33.387 --> 01:37.031
We are literally going to sleep our way to the top, literally.

01:44.138 --> 01:50.345
Because unfortunately for men, sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol.

01:51.591 --> 01:54.411
I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged...

01:54.505 --> 01:57.479
...that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before.

01:58.304 --> 02:00.563
And I felt like saying to him but I didn't say it,...

02:00.700 --> 02:02.091
...I felt like saying, "You know what?...

02:02.359 --> 02:05.970
If you had gotten five, this dinner would have been a lot more interesting."

02:10.517 --> 02:15.951
There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship especially here in Washington.

02:16.033 --> 02:19.188
If you try to make a breakfast date and you say, "How about eight o'clock?"...

02:19.527 --> 02:22.327
...they're likely to tell you, "Eight o'clock is too late for me, but that's okay,..."

02:22.473 --> 02:26.407
"...you know, I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight."

02:27.313 --> 02:32.117
And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive,...

02:32.226 --> 02:36.952
...but the truth is they're not, because we, at the moment have had,...

02:37.571 --> 02:44.037
...brilliant leaders in business, in finance, in politics, making terrible decisions.

02:45.118 --> 02:49.155
So a high IQ does not mean that you are a good leader,...

02:49.601 --> 02:55.805
...because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic.

02:57.507 --> 03:01.353
And we've had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics.

03:01.805 --> 03:07.397
In fact, I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters,...

03:07.487 --> 03:08.657
...they might still be around.

03:12.565 --> 03:17.821
While all the brothers were busy, you know, just being hyperconnected twenty-four seven,...

03:18.209 --> 03:21.677
...maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg, because she would have woken up ...

03:21.812 --> 03:27.545
...from a seven and a half or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture.

03:28.886 --> 03:34.995
So, as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment,...

03:35.669 --> 03:41.222
...what is good for us on a personal level, what's going to bring more joy, gratitude,...

03:41.755 --> 03:48.821
...effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world.

03:49.831 --> 03:58.103
So, I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us,...

03:58.618 --> 04:01.805
...to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep.

04:02.011 --> 04:02.541
Thank you.
