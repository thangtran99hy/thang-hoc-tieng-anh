00:01.577 --> 00:04.859
I'd like to retell a familiar tale called the orange quarrel...

00:05.071 --> 00:07.816
...to illustrate what we mean by beyond win-win.

00:09.203 --> 00:14.042
This story is adapted from "Getting to Yes" by Fisher and Ury at Harvard University.

00:15.597 --> 00:20.709
It was a rather explosive situation because two children were using adversarial methods...

00:20.811 --> 00:23.005
...that ignore the interests of the other party.

00:23.945 --> 00:26.031
Both children wanted the only orange...

00:26.109 --> 00:30.959
...and they were heading for a lose-lose situation: destroyed orange.

00:31.381 --> 00:35.305
Or at best, win-lose if one child overpowered the other for the whole orange.

00:36.958 --> 00:40.264
Fortunately, a clever mediator came along with a good idea.

00:41.315 --> 00:43.430
Jenny cut, Joey choose.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.631
This was a good solution and a win-win solution...

00:47.708 --> 00:50.311
...compared to what could have happened in an all-out fight.

00:51.345 --> 00:54.717
All things being equal, this seemed like a pretty fair solution.

00:55.662 --> 00:58.450
Both children got 50 percent of what they wanted.

00:59.819 --> 01:03.357
But it turns out that we can do even better than this when we recognize...

01:03.453 --> 01:07.603
...that there are two important objectives that help us achieve superior agreements.

01:08.311 --> 01:10.001
Fairness and efficiency.

01:10.671 --> 01:14.353
Divide the benefits fairly and don't leave value on the table.

01:16.171 --> 01:19.275
The children in this conflict were using adversarial methods...

01:19.339 --> 01:22.185
...assuming a one-dimensional model of negotiations.

01:22.864 --> 01:24.765
Both children wanted the whole orange...

01:24.976 --> 01:29.224
...and the problem was that if one was to get more, the other had to get less.

01:30.283 --> 01:34.140
The first step in solving this problem is to relabel these scales.

01:34.339 --> 01:38.186
Instead of thinking that each child wants 100 percent of the orange,...

01:38.588 --> 01:43.226
...consider rather that each child wants to become 100 percent satisfied.

01:44.115 --> 01:46.915
Now we can take these scales and reorient them...

01:47.087 --> 01:51.105
...so that we're viewing the case in multidimensional satisfaction space.

01:51.923 --> 01:57.371
Now it's no longer necessarily true that one party has to lose when another one gains.

01:58.569 --> 02:00.974
Recall the solution in our previous scenario.

02:01.697 --> 02:03.725
We did achieve our fairness objective.

02:04.135 --> 02:06.953
Both parties got 50 percent of what they wanted.

02:07.242 --> 02:12.133
But when we plot this solution on the graph, we see that there may be room for improvement.

02:13.211 --> 02:18.115
To further explore this, we dig a little deeper into our bag of interest-based principles...

02:18.314 --> 02:20.757
...and ask each child why they want the orange.

02:21.248 --> 02:24.518
It turns out that Jenny isn't interested in eating the orange.

02:24.887 --> 02:29.081
She wants to bake a cake that calls for the peels of exactly one orange.

02:29.599 --> 02:33.165
Joey, on the other hand, can never get enough oranges to eat...

02:33.437 --> 02:36.121
...but always throws the peels into the waste bin.

02:37.054 --> 02:39.453
So now you know the optimal solution.

02:40.193 --> 02:43.263
Give Jenny all the peels and Joey all the fruit .

02:43.889 --> 02:49.086
They both get 100 percent of what they wanted which achieves our efficiency objective.
