00:00.363 --> 00:05.491
Too often teams and organizations are unclear about the goals or top priorities really are.

00:06.349 --> 00:09.775
Coaches and players are simply not on the same page.

00:10.065 --> 00:13.459
What you get is everyone just kind of running around in all directions,...

00:13.697 --> 00:15.876
...instead of working together toward the same goal.

00:16.692 --> 00:20.570
The inability to take high-level goals and strategies of an organization...

00:21.023 --> 00:26.071
...and then to translate those into action is a major problem in most organizations.

00:26.562 --> 00:29.653
It's one thing to come up with great strategies and goals,...

00:30.029 --> 00:32.131
...but it's quite another to actually get them done.

00:32.902 --> 00:35.512
This is what we can call "The Execution Gap."

00:36.311 --> 00:39.001
In a landmark study done by the Harris Poll group,...

00:39.447 --> 00:43.345
...we discovered some revealing statistics as to why execution breaks down...

00:43.746 --> 00:47.727
...and why goals aren't translated into action on the front line.

00:48.241 --> 00:51.644
First finding, only 15 percent of those surveyed...

00:51.728 --> 00:56.792
...can actually identify their organization's most important goals or top priorities.

00:57.384 --> 01:01.630
Either there are too many goals or they change too often or they simply don't have any.

01:02.445 --> 01:05.279
And in most cases, they are vastly under communicated.

01:06.161 --> 01:10.607
Just because the leaders are clear on what they want to achieve, it doesn't necessarily mean...

01:10.977 --> 01:15.235
...that the front line where the action really happens knows what the goals are.

01:15.587 --> 01:20.093
After all, in a very real sense, the front line produces the bottom line.

01:20.448 --> 01:25.476
Second, people may know what the goals are but too often they haven't bought into them.

01:25.973 --> 01:32.089
Only 19 percent surveyed say that they feel passionate about the top goals of their organizations.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.082
That's only one in five.

01:34.609 --> 01:36.116
There are number of reasons for this.

01:36.214 --> 01:38.518
But the primary one is that they feel no ownership.

01:38.777 --> 01:42.897
They don't feel that they have input into what is going to take to achieve the goal.

01:43.391 --> 01:45.731
They simply aren't emotionally connected to the goal.

01:46.468 --> 01:48.318
No involvement, no commitment.

01:48.747 --> 01:54.725
Third, those surveyed reported that they spend only 49 percent of their available work hours...

01:54.846 --> 01:56.394
...on the most important goals.

01:56.936 --> 02:01.217
The rest of the time is spent on urgent, but far less important activities.

02:01.475 --> 02:06.212
They get so distracted by urgent things that they neglect the most important things.

02:06.595 --> 02:09.775
Finally, people might know what the goals and top priorities are.

02:10.169 --> 02:11.267
They might even buy into them.

02:12.038 --> 02:14.870
But they don't know what they are supposed to do about them.

02:15.395 --> 02:20.269
In fact, 51 percent state that they personally do not understand what they...

02:20.623 --> 02:24.033
...are supposed to do to help the organization achieve its goals.

02:24.537 --> 02:30.218
Goals will not be executed until everyone clearly understands what the goal is...

02:30.547 --> 02:34.345
...and what they themselves specifically need to do to meet that goal.

02:35.187 --> 02:38.747
Once people are clear on what the goal is, then and only then,...

02:39.139 --> 02:42.757
...are they free to try new and better ways to reach that goal.

02:43.479 --> 02:47.073
So the point is, to achieve goals you've never achieved before,...

02:47.621 --> 02:51.183
...you simply need to start doing things you've never done before.
