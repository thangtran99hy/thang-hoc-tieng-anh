I like to ask whether or not you have goals, but I wanna ask you another question.

00:04.529 --> 00:10.983
How many of you know that if you had your life to live over again, you could do more than what you've done this far?

00:11.059 --> 00:11.941
Raise your hands, please.

00:12.869 --> 00:20.990
Now, that proves the point that what we do and what we accomplish in life is only a tip of the iceberg of what's possible for us.

00:21.729 --> 00:26.687
So, I want you to think about some goals that you like to achieve and I like for you to, let's say break them up in three categories.

00:26.757 --> 00:29.487
Number one, I want you to think about some personal goal you'd like to achieve.

00:30.555 --> 00:35.426
And I like for you to think about some career goal, some business goal that you'd like to achieve.

00:36.143 --> 00:39.727
And why don't you think about some social contribution?

00:40.158 --> 00:41.786
Some impact you'd like to make with your life.

00:41.887 --> 00:48.223
It was Horace Mann who said, "We should be ashamed to die until we've made some major contribution to humankind."

00:48.783 --> 00:53.442
I believe we live in the greatest country in the world that gives us an opportunity to leave our mark,...

00:53.747 --> 00:55.715
...to make a statement with our lives.

00:56.316 --> 01:03.204
And as you think about these goals, whatever those goals are, I want you to dramatically increase those goals and...

01:03.599 --> 01:07.158
...I wanna warn you, I don't want you to think about how you're going to do it.

01:07.607 --> 01:09.761
How is none of your business.

01:10.664 --> 01:14.909
The most important thing is just to increase those goals dramatically.

01:15.020 --> 01:19.945
I found that most people fail in life not because they aim too high and miss.

01:20.517 --> 01:26.197
Most people fail in life because they aim too low and hit,...

01:29.096 --> 01:30.834
..and many don't aim at all.
