You wanna become a risk taker. You wanna raise the bar on yourself.

00:03.729 --> 00:04.869
Most people won't do that.

00:05.361 --> 00:10.295
See most people engage in low-life living, low-risk living.

00:10.621 --> 00:13.554
This God said if you're not willing to risk, you cannot grow.

00:13.876 --> 00:16.447
And if you cannot grow, you cannot become your best.

00:16.701 --> 00:19.785
And if you cannot become your best, you can't be happy.

00:20.435 --> 00:24.451
And if you can't be happy, then what else is there?
