Singer songwriter Brienne Moore, a second year student at USC...

00:08.723 --> 00:12.121
...says that the first record she ever owned was by Whitney Houston...

00:12.498 --> 00:14.679
...and the music always played in her home.

00:15.154 --> 00:16.818
I just grew up listening to her.

00:17.173 --> 00:22.722
My parents always had her playing all the time, and she was a major, major influence.

00:29.215 --> 00:35.143
Lara Johnston is a vocal student. She says she is still overwhelmed by Whitney Houston's voice.

00:35.640 --> 00:41.840
She had such an incredible instrument like she had this stunning power...

00:41.927 --> 00:43.595
...that would just shock you, but she also had...

00:44.065 --> 00:51.575
...this real sweetness and gentle delicacy to her voice that her control was incredible.

00:55.851 --> 00:58.946
Lilliana de los Reyes is also studying voice.

00:59.067 --> 01:02.211
She was inspired by Houston's mastery on stage.

01:07.209 --> 01:10.388
The tone in her voice, she could take it to a whisper,...

01:10.847 --> 01:14.515
...and thousands of people were just silent, like be totally silent.

01:14.843 --> 01:19.445
So, she could totally command the stage, and I admire her for that.

01:22.052 --> 01:26.261
But with fame came pressure, and Whitney Houston struggled with drug abuse.

01:26.479 --> 01:31.179
The cause of her death is still uncertain pending the results of toxicology tests.

01:31.564 --> 01:35.065
But those who knew her in her prime recall a consummate artist...

01:35.285 --> 01:37.789
...who was down-to-earth and a joy to work with.

01:38.103 --> 01:42.838
Peter Baron worked at Arista Records for the legendary music producer Clive Davis.

01:43.123 --> 01:46.324
He oversaw a production of Houston's early music videos.

01:46.695 --> 01:51.515
She was thrown into this world and thrown into the space of music videos and...

01:51.978 --> 01:58.379
...the space of being famous and she just handled it like a total pro, sweet and nice.

01:58.511 --> 02:02.919
And, I had never worked with an artist like that before.

02:03.329 --> 02:05.773
The pressures on big stars can be unrelenting,...

02:06.015 --> 02:09.893
...says USC's Associate Dean For Popular Music, Chris Sampson.

02:10.180 --> 02:14.108
The pressures of maintaining success, of really thinking about...

02:14.184 --> 02:19.816
...how you're going to continue to keep your audience, is extraordinary.

02:19.956 --> 02:25.195
And I do know that people feel that pressure and a lot of times,...

02:25.564 --> 02:30.403
...insecurities creep in and that's part of something that has to be managed.

02:30.607 --> 02:35.821
But Whitney Houston's admirers say she created a legacy as a towering talent.

02:36.234 --> 02:39.462
I call her the greatest voice of all. It really, really truly was.

02:39.801 --> 02:43.377
And for Brienne Moore and many in a new generation of students,...

02:43.672 --> 02:48.215
...Whitney Houston remains an inspiration who set the standard for entertainers.

02:48.522 --> 02:51.535
