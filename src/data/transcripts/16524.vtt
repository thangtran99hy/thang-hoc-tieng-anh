Mathilde Loisel was a beautiful girl who was born to a poor background.

00:05.426 --> 00:10.494
She wanted to marry a wealthy man, but she married an ordinary clerk.

00:11.219 --> 00:15.639
Even though Mathilde was poor, she always desired a better life.

00:15.899 --> 00:19.768
She often sat by the window and talked to herself.

00:21.294 --> 00:29.349
If only I could go to rich, fancy balls. I would wear a beautiful dress and everyone would admire me.

00:30.017 --> 00:36.209
I would be surrounded by silk, ornaments and so many expensive things.

00:36.930 --> 00:40.277
Meanwhile, her husband had a simpler character.

00:41.096 --> 00:44.099
Oh, we have tomato soup for dinner again?

00:44.972 --> 00:47.243
It's wonderful. I love it!

00:48.900 --> 00:51.795
I hate this poor food and miserable life.

00:52.553 --> 00:57.101
Every day, she looked around her and knew that she was poor.

00:58.300 --> 01:01.168
One day, her husband came home with a letter.

01:01.863 --> 01:06.146
Here is some good news! We've been invited to a fancy ball!

01:06.780 --> 01:09.470
Mathilde Loisel read the invitation.

01:11.331 --> 01:14.705
It's terrible! I won't go there.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.891
What's wrong? I thought you'd be happy.

01:18.749 --> 01:23.096
Of course not. What will I wear around all those rich people?

01:24.314 --> 01:28.623
Her husband was heartbroken when he saw his wife crying.

01:29.311 --> 01:32.311
Okay. How much will a new dress cost?

01:32.928 --> 01:35.015
She stopped crying and said,...

01:35.893 --> 01:38.746
"I think that 400 francs should be enough."

01:39.470 --> 01:41.533
Her husband grew pale.

01:42.197 --> 01:47.233
Okay. I'll give you the money but make sure you get a really pretty one.

01:47.971 --> 01:52.421
Oh, thank you so much, darling. I love you.

01:53.185 --> 01:56.554
The day of the party drew closer and closer.

01:57.347 --> 01:59.942
Mathilde had bought the special dress.

02:00.747 --> 02:04.472
However, she still seemed sad and anxious.

02:05.133 --> 02:06.352
What's wrong, sweetie?

02:07.989 --> 02:11.433
I have no necklace to match my pretty new dress.

02:12.945 --> 02:15.532
But we spent all the money on your dress.

02:16.190 --> 02:18.349
How about wearing flowers instead?

02:19.026 --> 02:21.685
Flowers? That's impossible!

02:24.040 --> 02:26.949
Then ask your rich friend, Mrs. Forestier.

02:27.953 --> 02:30.633
I'm sure she'd let you borrow a beautiful necklace.

02:31.355 --> 02:33.930
Right! Why didn't I think of that?

02:34.682 --> 02:37.713
She went to her rich friend right away.

02:38.463 --> 02:43.495
Mrs. Forestier showed her poor friend a box filled with jewelry.

02:44.251 --> 02:46.229
Take what you want, my friend.

02:46.975 --> 02:53.140
There were pearl necklaces, ruby bracelets and golden rings in the box.

02:53.898 --> 02:57.239
Wow! They're all so beautiful!

02:57.956 --> 03:02.065
She tried them all on, one after another.

03:03.536 --> 03:05.609
I'll take this diamond necklace.
