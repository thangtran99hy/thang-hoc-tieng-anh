00:00.052 --> 00:00.539
Listen to me.

00:00.952 --> 00:02.935
Pain is temporary.

00:04.299 --> 00:09.671
It may last for a minute or an hour or a day or even a year.

00:11.478 --> 00:17.223
But eventually it will subside and something else will take its place.

00:18.057 --> 00:20.757
If I quit however, it will last forever.

00:21.445 --> 00:21.953
You're all spoiled.

00:22.080 --> 00:22.720
Some of you are spoiled.

00:22.785 --> 00:25.225
It's just bottom line, your parents have done everything for you.

00:25.911 --> 00:26.945
You never had to do nothing for yourself.

00:27.042 --> 00:27.503
You're spoiled.

00:27.602 --> 00:28.399
We're gonna keep it real tonight.

00:28.797 --> 00:30.278
Some of you are spoiled brats.

00:30.993 --> 00:34.537
Every time you ever got in trouble, somebody in your house got you out of it.

00:36.195 --> 00:38.836
Every time you've done something you're not supposed to do, people say,...

00:38.896 --> 00:40.043
..."Eric, your mother is a tyrant."

00:40.144 --> 00:40.591
You're right!

00:41.009 --> 00:41.727
She kicked me out.

00:41.826 --> 00:42.236
You're right!

00:42.404 --> 00:44.376
She's mean, but she developed a man.

00:44.561 --> 00:47.096
Because she put me out there and said, "You're gonna have to grow up!"

00:47.386 --> 00:49.235
And some of you have never learned to grow up.

00:50.227 --> 00:53.033
And so every time something get hard, you quit, you call momma.

00:53.349 --> 00:55.057
I dare you to take a little pain.

00:56.519 --> 00:57.061
I dare you.

00:58.252 --> 00:59.351
I dare you not to go home.

01:00.144 --> 01:02.037
Somebody said, "I've gotta go home, I feel bad."

01:02.393 --> 01:03.283
Go through it.

01:04.906 --> 01:05.701
You ain't gonna die.

01:05.981 --> 01:07.941
At the end of pain is success.

01:08.867 --> 01:11.029
You're not going to die because you feel a little pain.

01:13.396 --> 01:14.881
I'm not eating like I eat at home.

01:15.162 --> 01:16.729
That's why you're about to go to the next level,...

01:16.847 --> 01:18.297
...because if you keep eating like you eat at home,...

01:18.576 --> 01:20.422
...you'll keep being a boy or a girl.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.639
It's time to become man, woman.

01:25.229 --> 01:26.807
But I'm exactly where I want to be,...

01:27.190 --> 01:30.648
...because I realize I got to commit my very being to this thing.

01:31.509 --> 01:34.120
I gotta breathe it, I gotta eat it, I gotta sleep it.

01:34.344 --> 01:37.113
And until you get there, you'll never be successful in life.

01:37.626 --> 01:40.507
But once you get there, I guarantee you the world is yours.

01:40.907 --> 01:43.445
So, work hard and you can have whatever it is you want.
