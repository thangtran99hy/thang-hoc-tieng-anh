00:11.501 --> 00:15.635
All negotiations are similar in that they involve people taking initial positions,...

00:16.004 --> 00:19.406
...offering proposals, counterproposals, and concessions...

00:19.490 --> 00:21.457
...until finally coming to an agreement.

00:22.595 --> 00:26.787
The two main ways of looking at negotiation are distributive, win-lose;

00:27.138 --> 00:28.774
...and integrative, win-win.

00:29.921 --> 00:32.975
Distributive bargaining emphasizes individual gains.

00:33.507 --> 00:37.769
Resources are viewed as limited and everyone wants to claim their share of the pie.

00:39.267 --> 00:43.639
Distributive bargainers tend to avoid sharing or misrepresenting information,...

00:44.231 --> 00:46.757
...and view other parties as the enemy to be defeated.

00:48.639 --> 00:51.171
Integrative bargaining emphasizes joint gains.

00:51.787 --> 00:54.001
By engaging in cooperative problem solving,...

00:54.439 --> 00:58.667
...the goal of integrative bargaining is to expand the pie so there's more for everyone.

00:59.990 --> 01:03.543
Integrative bargainers tend to share information openly,...

01:04.087 --> 01:06.723
...and view other parties as a partner or teammate.

01:08.441 --> 01:10.372
In all integrative negotiations,...

01:10.528 --> 01:14.481
...it's important to keep in mind the following tips of principled negotiation.

01:16.349 --> 01:18.230
Separate the people from the problem.

01:19.208 --> 01:22.936
It is possible to be soft on the people but still hard on the problem,...

01:23.345 --> 01:26.272
...even if you perceive the people as the reason for the problem.

01:28.065 --> 01:30.641
Focus on interests, not positions.

01:31.977 --> 01:35.435
Sometimes, people take positions that don't reflect their real interests.

01:36.251 --> 01:39.186
Focus on the reasons why people want what they're asking for.

01:40.051 --> 01:41.159
Positions are changeable.

01:42.169 --> 01:44.030
Invent options for mutual gain.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.944
In any given scenario, there's more than one solution.

01:48.617 --> 01:53.739
Make sure you're brainstorming to think of every possible solution that could get you to a resolution.

01:55.625 --> 01:57.091
Use objective criteria.

01:58.323 --> 02:00.817
Rather than making negotiations a contest of will,...

02:01.381 --> 02:04.833
...concentrate on using a standard, agreed upon measure of success...

02:05.033 --> 02:06.453
...that everyone can work toward.

02:08.444 --> 02:11.641
When several people or organizations are involved in a negotiation,...

02:11.862 --> 02:15.727
...it becomes a complex interaction that requires serious consideration...

02:15.965 --> 02:18.564
...and a range of approaches recognizing this complexity.
