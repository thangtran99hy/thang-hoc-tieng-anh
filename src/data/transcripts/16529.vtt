We believe any dish can be made at exquisite levels of quality if you really care about it.

00:06.064 --> 00:11.629
Modernist cuisine is both about modern style food but also very traditional style food...

00:11.919 --> 00:15.863
...that we made better or more conveniently in a new way.

00:16.937 --> 00:20.115
So, we cover things like the ideal way to make a hamburger.

00:20.633 --> 00:25.715
We look at everywhere of the burger from the bun, the cheese, the ketchup,...

00:26.397 --> 00:30.214
...the garnish, the patty, obviously that's the very important one.

00:30.668 --> 00:33.810
And we took it layer by layer, the buns, it had to be that perfect balance...

00:33.895 --> 00:39.057
...between that sort of delicate sweetness of a traditional hamburger bun,...

00:39.559 --> 00:43.499
...where it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the components.

00:44.169 --> 00:47.873
But also, it's interesting and has that most ideal fluffy texture.

00:48.429 --> 00:49.605
The cheese is constructed,...

00:50.089 --> 00:54.875
...so we have access to different emulsifiers and the most fine salts.

00:54.953 --> 01:00.540
In this case, a combination of sodium hexametaphosphates and some carrageenans,...

01:00.614 --> 01:04.902
...carrageenans being a seaweed extract that help to gel dairy there.

01:06.162 --> 01:10.857
And so, we created what people love in an American cheese slice,...

01:10.955 --> 01:13.255
...which is how fluid it is and unctuous.

01:13.756 --> 01:17.127
But recreating it from delicious cheese Gruyere...

01:17.237 --> 01:19.860
...or really good aged Gruyere or some cheddar,...

01:21.748 --> 01:25.237
...people would have experienced it when they put a slice of cheddar on their cheeseburger.

01:25.929 --> 01:27.655
It breaks down and you have the oil,...

01:27.797 --> 01:30.871
...the energy very extensive that the oil kind of splits out...

01:30.956 --> 01:33.221
...and it has the flavor, but the texture is just not right.

01:33.905 --> 01:37.539
So, we were able to create that perfect texture with really good cheese.

01:38.793 --> 01:44.610
The patty, grinding the meat and molding it as it comes out of the grinder...

01:44.678 --> 01:47.073
... and keeping the strands parallel,...

01:47.569 --> 01:49.375
...so that when you bite into the hamburger,...

01:49.439 --> 01:53.269
...it's just a very even bite and so it's very juicy.

01:54.453 --> 01:57.781
And that's molded and frozen and then sliced on a bun sauce.

01:57.841 --> 02:00.618
Yeah, I think it's just very even-looking patties.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.528
After that, we took this experiment quite a bit further...

02:05.305 --> 02:08.505
...and we worked with the technique called cryofrying.

02:08.965 --> 02:12.211
It's where you cook a food whether it's sous vide or traditionally...

02:12.820 --> 02:14.441
...but just until it's cooked through.

02:15.031 --> 02:19.578
And then, you sear it by first dipping it in liquid nitrogen...

02:20.014 --> 02:24.259
...to freeze the surface and then frying it in a very hot oil.

02:24.840 --> 02:29.470
And what happens during that process is that the surface that was frozen thaws

02:30.187 --> 02:33.594
...but the very outside bratens, so you get this beautiful crust...

02:33.719 --> 02:37.773
...but you don't get that ingredients those you're used to in traditional searing.

02:38.706 --> 02:40.711
And so everything is very juicy, everything is very even...

02:40.790 --> 02:45.024
...but you get this very intense caramelization or a minor reaction on the meat.

02:46.432 --> 02:50.986
So with the burger, we cook it sous vide but we don't vacuum-seal.

02:51.510 --> 02:56.430
Just in a Ziploc bag, the butter so that you don't collapse the structure of the patty.

02:56.888 --> 03:03.289
To 53 Celsius, that's just like basically rare and then follow that cryofry process.

03:05.825 --> 03:06.815
Quite an amazing patty,...

03:06.941 --> 03:10.159
...all the textures that you want, all the flavors very juicy, very tender.

03:11.328 --> 03:13.797
Overall, this process takes about 36 hours.

03:15.023 --> 03:17.043
And, I think there's something really cool about that.

03:17.185 --> 03:18.039
Now there're people who say,...

03:18.109 --> 03:21.194
..."Well, did you really need to put all that effort onto a hamburger?"

03:22.175 --> 03:27.033
And we say, "If you love hamburgers, it's kinda cool knowing what the ultimate burger is."

03:27.893 --> 03:30.629
And maybe, you won't have that ultimate burger every day, maybe you never have it.

03:30.849 --> 03:33.435
But it's still cool to know what the ultimate burger is.
