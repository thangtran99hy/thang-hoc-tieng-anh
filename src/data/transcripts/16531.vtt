Don't worry if your resume looks like you've bopped around a lot especially if you're a free agent who's a serial monogamist when it comes to clients.

00:07.250 --> 00:11.187
The reason that you became a free agent is that you're too smart to hold on a regular job.

00:11.417 --> 00:15.533
What matters most to prospective clients and customers is whether you can solve their problem.

00:15.911 --> 00:19.399
If you've got a long list of previous clients for whom you've done terrific work,...

00:19.699 --> 00:23.293
...that's actually better than ten years of dutiful service to a single employer.

00:23.612 --> 00:29.723
The world of work today doesn't give out any prizes for lifetime service. It's much more demanding than that.

00:30.041 --> 00:33.016
It's always asking, "What have you done for me lately?"

00:33.507 --> 00:39.153
It rewards the ability to think creatively, to come up with new solutions, to deliver great value and service...

00:39.455 --> 00:42.338
...and even to give the world something it didn't know it was missing.
