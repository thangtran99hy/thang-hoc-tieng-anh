It's not uncommon for creative people to find themselves stuck in a job...

00:03.495 --> 00:06.072
...where they don't feel allowed to exercise their creativity.

00:06.227 --> 00:08.007
But there's an old adage that applies here.

00:08.639 --> 00:11.232
"It's often better to ask forgiveness than permission."

00:11.717 --> 00:14.172
Do what you need to do and worry about the consequences later.

00:14.563 --> 00:17.895
Pick one project at your job and work like the dickens...

00:17.985 --> 00:20.840
...to do something creative, amazing and breathtaking. 

00:21.285 --> 00:22.037
And then see what happens.

00:22.243 --> 00:26.029
If your boss freaks out, if people around you scorn you, if you get reprimanded...

00:26.549 --> 00:27.273
...then you've learned something.

00:27.815 --> 00:30.427
You're in a terrible job and you need to get out, now.

00:30.922 --> 00:32.717
Life is too short to work at a place like that.

00:32.996 --> 00:35.505
But if something else happens, as I suspect it might, if people say,...

00:35.667 --> 00:38.083
..."Hey, good job!" or, "Wow! That was amazing."

00:38.577 --> 00:40.269
Then you've also learned something important.

00:40.551 --> 00:42.637
You've learned the place wasn't as bad as you thought.

00:43.126 --> 00:46.013
You've learned more about your own capacities and, believe me,...

00:46.156 --> 00:48.231
...you've begun to change the culture of your organization.

00:48.714 --> 00:50.877
So give it a whirl. It's worth the risk.

00:51.311 --> 00:54.063
Whatever happens, you're going to learn something important.
