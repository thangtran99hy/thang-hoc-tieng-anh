Have you ever wondered about the great mysteries of life?

00:04.841 --> 00:06.623
Like how the universe began,...

00:07.363 --> 00:08.917
...who built the pyramids,...

00:09.712 --> 00:11.567
...the secret formula for Coca-Cola.

00:13.893 --> 00:17.606
Some scientists believe there may be a cosmic connection to these mysteries.

00:19.443 --> 00:25.776
No one knows for sure, but we do know that Coca-Cola has been around since the beginning of time.

00:28.250 --> 00:33.231
Coca-Cola was invented right here in the city of Atlanta over a hundred years ago.

00:37.482 --> 00:42.775
Back in 1886, a pharmacist named John Pemberton was experimenting with a new recipe.

00:44.003 --> 00:47.757
He took some secret ingredients and boiled them into a syrup.

00:48.923 --> 00:50.653
He thought it was pretty tasty.

00:52.037 --> 00:56.138
So, he took some to Jacob's Pharmacy where they mixed the syrup with plain water...

00:56.324 --> 00:58.655
...and placed it on sale for five cents a glass.

00:59.770 --> 01:04.951
Legend has it, an employee of the pharmacy accidentally mixed the syrup with carbonated water....

01:05.175 --> 01:06.847
...and served it over ice to a customer.

01:07.479 --> 01:12.005
Well, the customer absolutely loved it and the rest is history.

01:12.504 --> 01:16.149
Thus, was invented one of the greatest refreshments of all time.

01:18.131 --> 01:24.535
Dr. Pemberton's accountant was named Frank Robinson and it was his idea to call this new drink "Coca-Cola."

01:25.142 --> 01:29.151
In fact, he created the now famous trademark in his own handwriting.

01:30.163 --> 01:33.877
Dr. Pemberton never imagined the incredible future of his creation.

01:34.724 --> 01:39.401
In 1888, he sold the secret formula to a businessman named Asa Candler,...

01:39.534 --> 01:40.416
Ah, okay.

01:40.873 --> 01:44.638
...who later formed the corporation to produce and distribute Coca-Cola.

01:45.617 --> 01:48.856
As more and more people discover this delicious new refreshment,...

01:49.083 --> 01:52.331
...Coca-Cola began to pop up all over America.
