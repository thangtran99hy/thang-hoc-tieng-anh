You may think that something as small as being optimistic won't change much about your life.

00:04.550 --> 00:05.514
Have you ever heard this line?

00:05.985 --> 00:08.840
"Just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean the world isn't out to get me."

00:09.375 --> 00:13.292
Now that may be a joke, but many people believe the deck is stacked against them.

00:13.660 --> 00:16.952
People who are reverse paranoids, otherwise known as optimists,...

00:17.321 --> 00:22.228
...use the same consistent thinking, but they believe that the world is plotting to do them good.

00:22.882 --> 00:25.620
Everything that happens is pushing them in the right direction.

00:25.941 --> 00:27.836
This attitude breeds more good thoughts,...

00:27.929 --> 00:30.601
...so why not practice to become a reverse paranoid?

00:30.799 --> 00:34.313
Start seeing obstacles as opportunities to grow and change.

00:34.917 --> 00:38.320
When your presentation doesn't get the sale, see it as an opportunity...

00:38.396 --> 00:41.423
...to create a better presentation and become better at your job.

00:42.063 --> 00:47.216
See the task that gives you some power to change rather than the fear that makes you feel powerless.

00:47.544 --> 00:50.627
Look for the seed of something better when everything is going wrong.

00:51.173 --> 00:54.081
Almost everyone sees getting laid off as a bad thing,...

00:54.507 --> 00:58.333
...but even if you want your job to be over, the end always feels sad and uninspiring.

00:59.021 --> 01:03.845
The end of one job, however, always holds the promise of the new beginning of the next job.

01:04.049 --> 01:07.891
If you look at it that way, you're focusing on what a reverse paranoid thinks about.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.200
Identify the great benefit in every event.

01:11.941 --> 01:16.611
Soon, you'll start to see that good is not an accident but something you create with your attitudes.
