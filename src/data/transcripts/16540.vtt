Today, you've got to look at what you're doing and ask yourself three key questions.

00:03.803 --> 00:05.382
Can someone overseas do it cheaper?

00:05.664 --> 00:06.959
Can a computer do it faster?

00:07.279 --> 00:11.217
And does what you offer satisfy the growing nonmaterial, aesthetic, emotional,...

00:11.282 --> 00:14.161
...even spiritual demands of a very abundant age?

00:14.458 --> 00:16.374
You have to do something that's hard to outsource,...

00:16.781 --> 00:19.963
...hard to automate and it serves a need that goes beyond functional.

00:20.433 --> 00:22.247
And the abilities that meet this test...

00:22.666 --> 00:26.494
...tend not to be those left-brained, linear, SAT spreadsheet abilities...

00:26.571 --> 00:27.494
...although they still matter.

00:28.027 --> 00:32.746
Instead, they tend to be the right-brained, artistic, empathic, big picture skills...

00:33.196 --> 00:35.277
...we've often overlooked and undervalued.

00:35.925 --> 00:39.600
Beyond that, two other things matter: intrinsic motivation and persistence.

00:39.953 --> 00:44.224
You should do whatever you find inherently compelling, satisfying and challenging...

00:44.720 --> 00:48.759
...rather than try to pursue external rewards such as higher pay or promotions.

00:49.139 --> 00:52.326
The dirty little secret is that people who are intrinsically motivated,...

00:52.567 --> 00:56.116
...who do what they do out of the joy and challenge of the task itself,...

00:56.611 --> 00:59.992
...almost always outperform their extrinsically motivated peers.

01:00.229 --> 01:01.637
The other quality is persistence.

01:01.968 --> 01:03.993
I've seen this over and over.

01:04.289 --> 01:07.489
The people who accomplish the most stick with it.

01:08.013 --> 01:10.021
They persist, so should you.
