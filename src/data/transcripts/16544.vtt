Getting over a difficult situation isn't always easy.

00:03.119 --> 00:06.863
Our brains tend to lock in memories when an event causes strong emotions...

00:07.294 --> 00:09.481
...and negative emotions are very strong.

00:09.738 --> 00:13.101
And memories of them can come back to us quickly when things are going badly.

00:13.587 --> 00:16.938
So much of what we recall about our past is what didn't go well.

00:17.785 --> 00:20.018
Think of a failure from childhood or even high school.

00:20.701 --> 00:23.666
Remember that you were completely embarrassed in front of your gym class...

00:23.771 --> 00:26.627
...or the time you forgot your poem in the middle of reciting it.

00:27.199 --> 00:28.477
It really stuck with you, didn't it?

00:29.113 --> 00:31.071
That's because you were really uncomfortable.

00:31.496 --> 00:34.603
Your brain chemicals were ready to lock that memory into place.

00:35.113 --> 00:37.689
Probably to prevent you from doing the same thing again.

00:38.098 --> 00:41.747
But you've had a lot of successes, too. They just aren't as memorable.

00:42.285 --> 00:45.849
Unless they were extraordinary, they didn't come with a heightened emotional state.

00:46.259 --> 00:47.813
So, they weren't etched into your memory.

00:48.424 --> 00:49.382
So, what's the big deal?

00:50.115 --> 00:54.245
The problem is focusing on your failures negatively affects your self-esteem.

00:54.675 --> 00:58.011
And that prevents you from taking the risk you need to be successful,...

00:58.451 --> 00:59.828
...especially in your work life.

01:00.316 --> 01:04.595
You have to train your mind to recall the simple successes you've been having your whole life.

01:05.487 --> 01:09.715
When you consciously recognize your successes, it helps plant the positive in your mind...

01:10.413 --> 01:12.381
...and you can do it by writing a victory log.

01:12.648 --> 01:17.295
Every day, write down one or more successes and log it into your long-term memory.

01:17.844 --> 01:21.814
You can also look back on your life and list all the successes that you can recall.

01:22.520 --> 01:27.301
When you're having a tough day, you can reread your success list for genuine boost of confidence.
