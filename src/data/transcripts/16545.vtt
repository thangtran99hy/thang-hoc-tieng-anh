00:01.458 --> 00:06.609
The most expensive residential address in the United States is not in Hollywood or Manhattan.

00:06.864 --> 00:10.567
It's 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, the White House.

00:10.967 --> 00:16.237
Its current occupant, Barack Obama, raised nearly 750 million dollars in 2008...

00:16.678 --> 00:18.411
...to win the presidency and move in.

00:24.104 --> 00:27.153
The two major US parties, the Democrats and the Republicans,...

00:27.245 --> 00:32.095
...are locked in a massive fundraising effort that escalates with every presidential election.

00:32.772 --> 00:37.596
In 1992, the two parties raised a total of 135 million dollars.

00:37.952 --> 00:43.369
Sixteen years later, in 2008, they collectively took in 1.68 billion.

00:43.892 --> 00:45.365
Where does all that money go?

00:45.764 --> 00:49.797
At the independent research organization, The Heritage Foundation in Washington,...

00:50.149 --> 00:53.416
...analyst Brian Darling outlines the high costs of campaigning.

00:54.061 --> 00:57.191
Various things that make it so expensive are the advertisements...

00:57.256 --> 01:00.499
...that cost millions of dollars to run ad, whether it be radio or TV,...

01:00.843 --> 01:03.060
...the traveling expenses throughout the country,...

01:03.144 --> 01:06.895
...it's gonna cost a lot of money for these candidates to travel on a daily basis,...

01:07.273 --> 01:11.417
...and also the massive campaign organizations that these candidates need to put together.

01:12.073 --> 01:18.787
In the 1970s, Congress created a federal regulatory agency called the Federal Election Commission or FEC.

01:19.275 --> 01:24.910
Its twin goals are accountability and transparency as outlined by Commissioner Cynthia Bauerly.

01:25.338 --> 01:29.042
Everything that campaigns and candidates and parties do in our system...

01:29.343 --> 01:33.241
...is reported to our central location here at the FEC.

01:33.564 --> 01:37.469
And that is, almost immediately available to anyone who wants it on our website.

01:38.026 --> 01:44.200
Current federal regulations limit presidential candidate contributions from individuals to 2500 dollars,...

01:44.511 --> 01:47.651
...with most organizations limited to 5,000 dollars.

01:48.106 --> 01:51.096
Corporations and unions face strong restrictions.

01:51.546 --> 01:56.835
Along with creating the FEC, Congress also created a system of public financing,...

01:57.147 --> 01:59.344
...under which, in exchange for government funds,...

01:59.585 --> 02:02.737
...candidates accept limits on other cash they might raise.

02:03.103 --> 02:08.765
But in the 2012 presidential race, no candidates from either party have accepted public funding.

02:09.588 --> 02:13.868
In 2010, the US Supreme Court ruled that outside advocacy groups...

02:13.941 --> 02:17.596
...have the right to raise and spend money to influence elections.

02:18.047 --> 02:20.779
These Political Action Committees, commonly called PACs,...

02:21.151 --> 02:24.429
...have increasingly become a major force in the electoral process.

02:24.839 --> 02:28.209
At the Politico newspaper in Washington, reporter David Levinthal,...

02:28.551 --> 02:31.043
Really, there are few rules here for these groups.

02:31.339 --> 02:33.185
They can raise and spend unlimited sums of money.

02:33.343 --> 02:35.063
They can spend it whenever they want to.

02:35.430 --> 02:36.908
There's no time limitation.

02:37.231 --> 02:39.297
The messaging that they put out is not limited.

02:39.421 --> 02:43.605
They can directly, overtly advocate for a candidate's election...

02:43.703 --> 02:46.274
...or directly and overtly oppose a candidate.

02:46.715 --> 02:51.992
Observers say that the 2012 presidential election may be the first in which this outside PAC money...

02:52.319 --> 02:57.127
...may wind up exceeding what the candidates and their parties officially raise for themselves.

02:57.557 --> 02:59.199
And there are some who say that they fear...

02:59.411 --> 03:04.295
...what may become a literal tsunami of outside money essentially determining elections.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.569
