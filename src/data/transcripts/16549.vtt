Hey guys, how are you all doing?

00:01.218 --> 00:05.275
I get a lot of comments saying I try too hard to be cool and funny.

00:05.570 --> 00:09.941
And this offends me because it's true, I try really hard.

00:10.047 --> 00:11.369
And you guys aren't supposed to know that.

00:11.607 --> 00:16.464
So fine, no more trying to be cool. In fact, this video is gonna be about why I'm not cool.

00:17.055 --> 00:19.132
Ten reasons why I am not cool.

00:19.261 --> 00:24.303
I spend more time talking to a camera than I spend talking to females.

00:25.441 --> 00:30.943
I realize I do this a lot with my hair, like Justin Bieber with Tourette's.

00:31.057 --> 00:34.711
When I'm bored, my roommates and I have dance battles in my apartment.

00:42.608 --> 00:45.485
I'm also stubborn especially when I think I'm right.

00:46.091 --> 00:47.881
Hey Jeremy Lin of the Golden State Warriors,...

00:48.011 --> 00:50.936
...did you know that the African elephant is the largest animal in the world?

00:51.350 --> 00:53.651
Land animal, but the blue whale is probably the largest animal.

00:53.713 --> 00:53.975
No!

00:59.541 --> 01:06.114
Also, I subconsciously act black around black people and it's because I try really hard to fit in.

01:06.347 --> 01:08.005
Like, for shizzle.

01:08.339 --> 01:11.378
I secretly really want to be a Korean pop star.

01:15.378 --> 01:17.716
This is embarrassing, but I cry sometimes.

01:17.809 --> 01:23.834
I cried during "Up," I cried during "Kung Fu Panda 2." I cried listening to Adele's new album,...

01:23.939 --> 01:30.389
..."You could have had it all." I definitely cried when my hero Yao Ming retired.

01:31.937 --> 01:33.497
It was just so sad. Doesn't make...

01:33.583 --> 01:34.363
Hey man, are you all right?

01:34.477 --> 01:39.455
I'm fine! I'm fine, okay? He was the greatest NBA player ever. You won't understand.

01:40.032 --> 01:41.138
You won't understand!

01:42.962 --> 01:47.011
This is even more embarrassing, but my friends and I have matching pajamas.

01:51.377 --> 01:55.158
I like to show off sometimes especially when I'm at the gym, working out.

02:04.027 --> 02:07.677
My friends find me annoying because I'm super competitive all the time,...

02:07.793 --> 02:08.998
...even when it's unnecessary.

02:09.342 --> 02:12.988
Hey, Jeremy Lin. I bet you can't make this piece of paper into this trash can right here.

02:13.455 --> 02:13.760
Alright.

02:14.759 --> 02:19.466
Told you! I told you! Not in my house, baby! Not in my house!

02:22.153 --> 02:24.925
Anyway, those are the ten reasons why I'm not cool.

02:25.075 --> 02:27.954
I hope you'll still like me after this video. If not, I understand.

02:28.047 --> 02:32.236
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm about to go destroy my buddy Jeremy at a game of basketball.

02:35.449 --> 02:38.613
What are you doing? You could have broken my neck dude.

02:39.215 --> 02:43.697
Thanks everyone for watching and I will see you guys soon. Bye!
