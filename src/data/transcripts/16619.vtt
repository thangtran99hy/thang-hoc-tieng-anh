00:07.314 --> 00:11.507
Earthquake alarms ring at Tokyo's Metropolitan Government headquarters,...

00:11.770 --> 00:13.612
...sending workers running for cover.

00:13.990 --> 00:17.827
Across the city, workers in another tower reacts to a fire alert.

00:18.321 --> 00:22.761
It's all part of a citywide drill organized by the government last month.

00:23.515 --> 00:28.197
Scientists warned the likelihood of a big quake striking Tokyo has increased...

00:28.375 --> 00:32.460
...since the huge tremblor and tsunami in Northern Japan last March.

00:33.065 --> 00:37.914
Shinichi Sakai is from the Earthquake Research Institute at Tokyo University.

00:42.547 --> 00:46.859
When we did the calculations, tectonic activity was up about six or seven times.

00:47.247 --> 00:52.231
At that point in time, we established there was a 98 percent chance of a quake within 30 years,...

00:52.779 --> 00:55.742
...or for the next four years, it would likely be 70 percent.

01:03.781 --> 01:08.704
Animation models are being used to predict the potential damage from a large quake,...

01:09.070 --> 01:14.433
...determine the locations of weaker buildings, as well as fire hazards, and evacuation bottlenecks.

01:14.921 --> 01:19.176
Official estimates say a 7.3 magnitude quake in Tokyo...

01:19.494 --> 01:25.107
...could cause 11,000 casualties and destroy 850,000 buildings.

01:25.908 --> 01:31.332
At Tokyo's Shimizu Corporation, scientists work on cutting-edge construction technologies.

01:31.774 --> 01:34.672
This building is supported on hardened rubber dampers.

01:35.223 --> 01:38.991
Cameras captured the moment last year's giant quake struck it.

01:39.499 --> 01:42.791
The so-called seismic isolation is easy to see.

01:43.479 --> 01:48.017
Other technologies developed here include suspending buildings from a central pillar,...

01:48.342 --> 01:53.107
...which helps to absorb seismic shocks, and partially floating buildings on water,...

01:53.381 --> 01:56.109
...which has been shown to reduce movement significantly.

01:56.821 --> 01:59.927
Masaaki Saruta is a chief engineer at Shimizu.

02:00.241 --> 02:03.457
He says Tokyo is better prepared than most cities.

02:10.008 --> 02:13.873
Recently constructed buildings are strong enough to withstand a big earthquake.

02:14.239 --> 02:16.988
Even older buildings in Tokyo have been strengthened.

02:17.415 --> 02:21.448
I will not say there will be no destruction at all, but we are prepared for this.

02:22.411 --> 02:29.297
Amateur video posted online shows skyscrapers in Tokyo swaying alarmingly in the earthquake last March.

02:29.713 --> 02:31.906
Saruta says it's part of the design.

02:37.455 --> 02:41.123
But basically you do not need to worry about a building even if it's swaying.

02:44.385 --> 02:48.591
What I mean is, you would expect a tall building to sway like that because of the design.

02:54.693 --> 02:59.495
Last year's quake, 300 kilometers to the north, shut down much of Tokyo,...

02:59.842 --> 03:05.267
...alerting authorities to prepare for a big earthquake even closer to this huge metropolis.

03:05.918 --> 03:08.283
