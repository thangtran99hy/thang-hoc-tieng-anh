00:01.231 --> 00:05.318
Feeding today's population is a challenge for an already stressed environment.

00:05.841 --> 00:08.085
Experts project that the world's population...

00:08.179 --> 00:13.255
...will grow from seven billion people today to nine billion over the next 30 years.

00:13.791 --> 00:18.227
Nancy Morgan is the Food and Agriculture Organization's liaison to the World Bank.

00:18.455 --> 00:23.816
Basically, meat production and consumption will both need to double by the year 2050.

00:24.071 --> 00:28.130
The FAO says there are currently 1.5 billion head of cattle,...

00:28.637 --> 00:32.253
...one billion pigs and six billion chickens in the world.

00:32.765 --> 00:37.717
In the US alone, millions of these and other animals are killed every year for food.

00:38.707 --> 00:40.695
Morgan says that over the past decade,...

00:40.880 --> 00:45.973
...worldwide consumption and production of meat grew faster than any other commodity.

00:46.120 --> 00:52.005
The challenge is how would you ensure food without increasing animal numbers...

00:52.081 --> 00:55.755
...and having an impact on fragile lands and our resource base?

00:56.079 --> 01:01.466
More than half of the agricultural land in the world is used to raise and feed livestock.

01:02.088 --> 01:07.345
Those farm animals are also responsible for 18 percent of the greenhouse gases...

01:07.602 --> 01:09.702
...released into the atmosphere every year,...

01:10.155 --> 01:14.709
...methane emissions that scientists say are warming the Earth's climate.

01:15.633 --> 01:18.931
The World Preservation Foundation, a private environmental group,...

01:19.357 --> 01:23.065
...recently published a report on ways to slow that climate change.

01:23.648 --> 01:26.498
It focuses on reducing livestock populations.

01:28.263 --> 01:32.899
The group says it is especially concerned about widespread forest burning...

01:33.215 --> 01:35.542
...to clear land for cattle operations,...

01:35.941 --> 01:39.494
...as seen in these fires in Brazil's Amazon forest region.

01:40.580 --> 01:44.415
Gerard Wedderburn-Bisshop is the foundation's executive director.

01:44.555 --> 01:49.295
The fire for pasture maintenance and fire for deforestation are our targets.

01:50.155 --> 01:54.204
For methane, by far, the greatest source is livestock agriculture.

01:54.601 --> 02:00.637
The World Preservation Foundation wants governments to stop subsidizing meat and dairy production.

02:01.245 --> 02:06.448
Meat and dairy consumption has helped to push global warming to tipping points.

02:07.293 --> 02:10.779
It is driving massive environmental destruction and pollution...

02:11.246 --> 02:14.299
...and is killing us with diabetes, heart diseases and cancers.

02:14.697 --> 02:18.740
But in many rural areas, people depend on animals for food and income.

02:19.468 --> 02:24.016
A reduction in global livestock production is improbable, says Jerry Hatfield,...

02:24.372 --> 02:28.712
...director of Agriculture and the Environment at the US Department of Agriculture.

02:28.992 --> 02:33.689
We actually have more pasture and ranch land than we do arable land...

02:34.385 --> 02:36.291
...or land we put into cultivation.

02:36.468 --> 02:40.685
He says research centers are looking at ways to make food animal operations...

02:40.769 --> 02:43.851
...more efficient while also protecting the environment.

02:44.266 --> 02:47.073
I think that, you know, it's all about a balance...

02:47.138 --> 02:49.255
...and I don't think that we've done a very good job.

02:49.672 --> 02:53.325
Experts agree that the next few decades will present a puzzle,...

02:53.741 --> 02:58.252
...how to feed nine billion people without wrecking the planet in the process.

02:58.896 --> 03:01.548
This is Zulima Palacio, VOA News.
