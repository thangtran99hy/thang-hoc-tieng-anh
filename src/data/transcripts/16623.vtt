00:03.861 --> 00:05.892
The season of Lent is a time for sacrifice...

00:05.968 --> 00:09.963
...and reflection as the Church waits to celebrate the Resurrection of Christ from the cross.

00:10.653 --> 00:13.100
Learn the history and tradition behind the celebration.

00:14.383 --> 00:20.610
You will need a Bible, a calendar, a church to attend, a sacrifice and prayer.

00:21.669 --> 00:26.824
Step one: Read the story of Jesus in the desert found in chapter four in the book of Matthew.

00:27.449 --> 00:31.868
Lent is a time meant to reflect the 40 days that Jesus wandered and fasted in the desert.

00:32.787 --> 00:36.458
Step two: Note the colors used for drapes and on the altars.

00:36.868 --> 00:41.283
The color purple is often used as it is a mourning color to signify Christ's suffering.

00:41.631 --> 00:43.323
But it is also the color of royalty...

00:43.422 --> 00:46.867
...and represents Christ rising from the grave to become the King of kings.

00:47.931 --> 00:50.531
Step three: Mark the days on your calendar.

00:50.977 --> 00:55.647
The Lenten season begins on Ash Wednesday and concludes 40 days later on Easter.

00:56.715 --> 00:59.227
Step four: Celebrate Ash Wednesday.

00:59.883 --> 01:02.199
Crosses are marked on the foreheads of members of the Church...

01:02.290 --> 01:05.160
...using ashes to remind parishioners of their mortality.

01:05.637 --> 01:07.887
"From dust we came and to dust we will return."

01:08.774 --> 01:12.195
Step five: Sacrifice what you take for granted during Lent.

01:12.727 --> 01:15.244
Catholics fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday,...

01:15.497 --> 01:17.695
...and abstain from meat on Fridays during Lent.

01:18.271 --> 01:22.443
The meaning behind abstaining is meant as a reminder of Christ's sacrifice in the desert.

01:23.141 --> 01:25.347
Give up a favorite food or vice during Lent.

01:26.445 --> 01:29.867
Step six: Make Lent a time of prayer and penance.

01:30.285 --> 01:34.171
Lent is a time of reflection meant to draw you closer to your relationship with God.

01:35.229 --> 01:38.161
Step seven: The last Friday in Lent is Good Friday,...

01:38.367 --> 01:40.789
...which is marked as the day Jesus was nailed to the cross.

01:41.438 --> 01:45.693
On Easter, celebrate the Resurrection of Jesus, marking the end of Lent.

01:46.355 --> 01:46.930
Did you know?

01:47.275 --> 01:49.549
The number 40 is repeated throughout the Bible,...

01:49.679 --> 01:53.299
...as in the story of Noah, where it rains for 40 days and 40 nights,...

01:53.461 --> 01:56.253
...and when Moses was on the mountain for 40 days and nights.
