00:14.935 --> 00:21.851
Every year in the United States alone, 2,077,000 couples...

00:22.147 --> 00:27.585
...make a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together.

00:29.929 --> 00:34.989
And not to have sex with anyone else, ever.

00:36.091 --> 00:38.555
He buys a ring, she buys a dress.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.894
They go shopping for all sorts of things.

00:43.214 --> 00:47.697
She takes him to Arthur Murray for ballroom dancing lessons.

00:48.652 --> 00:49.920
And the big day comes.

00:50.213 --> 00:55.989
And they'll stand before God and family, and some guy her dad once did business with,...

00:56.074 --> 01:02.809
...and they'll vow that nothing, not abject poverty, not life-threatening illness,...

01:03.132 --> 01:11.820
...not complete and utter misery will ever put the tiniest damper on their eternal love and devotion.

01:13.621 --> 01:18.187
These optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through...

01:18.505 --> 01:24.772
...hot flashes and midlife crises and a cumulative 50-pound weight gain...

01:25.277 --> 01:32.319
...until that far-off day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.580
You know, because they can't hear the snoring anymore.

01:36.395 --> 01:41.372
And then they'll get stupid drunk and smash cake in each other's faces and do the "Macarena."

01:41.445 --> 01:47.258
And we'll be there, showering them with towels and toasters and drinking their free booze...

01:47.512 --> 01:50.895
...and throwing birdseed at them every single time.

01:51.612 --> 01:58.342
Even though we know, statistically, half of them will be divorced within a decade.

02:01.051 --> 02:03.285
Of course, the other half won't, right?

02:03.660 --> 02:09.169
They'll keep forgetting anniversaries and arguing about where to spend holidays...

02:09.237 --> 02:14.806
...and debating which way the toilet paper should come off of the roll.

02:15.729 --> 02:21.099
And some of them will even still be enjoying each other's company...

02:21.206 --> 02:23.744
...when neither of them can chew solid food anymore.

02:24.615 --> 02:27.097
And researchers want to know why.

02:27.605 --> 02:30.919
I mean, look, it doesn't take a double-blind, placebo-controlled study...

02:31.003 --> 02:33.608
...to figure out what makes a marriage not work, right?

02:34.083 --> 02:40.736
Disrespect, boredom, too much time on Facebook, having sex with other people.

02:41.150 --> 02:44.545
But you can have the exact opposite of all of those things:...

02:44.638 --> 02:52.681
...respect, excitement, a broken Internet connection, mind-numbing monogamy,...

02:53.503 --> 02:55.824
...and the thing still can go to hell in a handbasket.

02:56.570 --> 02:59.037
So what's going on when it doesn't?

03:00.153 --> 03:05.191
What do the folks who make it all the way to side-by-side burial plots have in common?

03:05.743 --> 03:07.133
What are they doing right?

03:07.407 --> 03:09.477
What can we learn from them?

03:10.415 --> 03:13.761
And if you're still happily sleeping solo,...

03:14.197 --> 03:18.477
...why should you stop what you're doing and make it your life's work...

03:18.673 --> 03:23.584
...to find that one special person that you can annoy for the rest of your life?
