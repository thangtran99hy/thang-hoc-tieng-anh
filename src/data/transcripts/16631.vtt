00:00.043 --> 00:02.717
How many of you have heard of the company Atlassian?

00:04.818 --> 00:06.081
It looks like less than half.

00:07.857 --> 00:11.825
Atlassian is an Australian software company.

00:12.420 --> 00:14.247
And they do something incredibly cool.

00:14.641 --> 00:16.818
A few times a year they tell their engineers,...

00:17.130 --> 00:19.873
..."Go for the next 24 hours and work on anything you want,..."

00:21.169 --> 00:22.749
"...as long as it's not part of your regular job."

00:22.839 --> 00:23.757
"Work on anything you want"...

00:24.075 --> 00:29.673
...so that engineers use this time to come up with a cool patch of code, come up with an elegant hack.

00:29.924 --> 00:35.519
Then they present all of these stuff that they've developed to their teammates, to the rest of the company,...

00:35.761 --> 00:38.647
...in this wild and woolly all-hands meeting at the end of the day.

00:39.709 --> 00:41.339
And then, being Australians, everybody has a beer.

00:41.896 --> 00:43.759
They call them FedEx Days.

00:44.918 --> 00:48.587
Why? Because you have to deliver something overnight.

00:50.646 --> 00:51.143
It's not bad.

00:51.492 --> 00:52.600
It's a huge trademark violation...

00:52.679 --> 00:53.281
...but it's pretty clever.

00:55.862 --> 01:00.521
That one day of intense autonomy has produced a whole array of software fixes that might never have existed.

01:01.315 --> 01:05.207
And it's worked so well that Atlassian has taken it to the next level with 20 Percent Time,...

01:05.563 --> 01:07.412
...done famously at Google,...

01:07.691 --> 01:11.189
...where engineers can work, spend 20% of their time working on anything they want.

01:11.829 --> 01:15.466
They have autonomy over their time, their task, their team, their technique,...

01:15.639 --> 01:17.292
...okay? Radical amounts of autonomy.

01:17.675 --> 01:19.837
And at Google, as many of you know,...

01:21.689 --> 01:25.594
...about half of the new products in a typical year are birthed during that 20 Percent Time,...

01:26.533 --> 01:28.748
...things like Gmail, Orkut, Google News.

01:29.425 --> 01:31.484
Let me give you an even more radical example of it.

01:32.201 --> 01:34.353
Something called the Results Only Work Environment,...

01:34.506 --> 01:35.435
...the ROWE,...

01:36.141 --> 01:40.485
...created by two American consultants, in place at about a dozen companies around North America.

01:40.747 --> 01:43.349
In a ROWE, people don't have schedules.

01:44.999 --> 01:46.315
They show up when they want.

01:46.587 --> 01:49.920
They don't have to be in the office at a certain time or any time.

01:50.696 --> 01:52.271
They just have to get their work done.

01:52.594 --> 01:56.809
How they do it, when they do it, where they do it is totally up to them.

01:57.768 --> 02:01.145
Meetings in these kinds of environments are optional.

02:02.297 --> 02:02.876
What happens?

02:03.699 --> 02:08.211
Almost across the board, productivity goes up, worker engagement goes up,...

02:09.068 --> 02:11.623
...worker satisfaction goes up, turnover goes down.

02:12.432 --> 02:16.463
Autonomy, mastery and purpose: these are the building blocks of a new way of doing things.

02:16.564 --> 02:21.924
Now, some of you might look at this and say, "Hmm, that sounds nice but it's utopian."
