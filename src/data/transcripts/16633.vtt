The mid-1990s, Microsoft started an encyclopedia called Encarta.

00:04.329 --> 00:05.723
They had deployed all the right incentives.

00:06.304 --> 00:07.096
All the right incentives.

00:07.403 --> 00:11.118
They paid professionals to write and edit thousands of articles.

00:11.352 --> 00:15.741
Well-compensated managers oversaw the whole thing to make sure it came in on budget and on time.

00:18.009 --> 00:20.104
A few years later, another encyclopedia got started.

00:20.456 --> 00:21.671
Different model, right?

00:23.460 --> 00:24.090
Do it for fun.

00:25.134 --> 00:27.462
No one gets paid a cent or a Euro or a Yen.

00:29.233 --> 00:30.178
Do it because you like to do it.

00:31.161 --> 00:35.075
Now if you had, just ten years ago, gone to an economist anywhere...

00:35.393 --> 00:38.301
...and said, "Hey, I got these two different models for creating an encyclopedia."

00:38.900 --> 00:40.369
If they went head-to-head, who would win?

00:41.820 --> 00:46.953
Ten years ago, you could not have found a single, sober economist anywhere on planet Earth,...

00:47.770 --> 00:49.689
...who would have predicted the Wikipedia model.
