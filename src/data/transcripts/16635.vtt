This cellphone started its trajectory in an artisanal mine in the Eastern Congo.

00:09.018 --> 00:16.399
It's mined by armed gangs using child slaves, what the UN Security Council calls "blood minerals"...

00:16.829 --> 00:22.278
...then traveled into some components and ended up in a factory in Xinjin in China.

00:23.427 --> 00:26.901
In that factory, over a dozen people have committed suicide already this year.

00:28.199 --> 00:30.827
One man died after working a 36 - hour shift.

00:32.393 --> 00:35.465
We all love chocolate. We buy it for our kids.

00:35.855 --> 00:40.858
80 percent of the cocoa comes from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana and it's harvested by children.

00:41.831 --> 00:44.187
In Cote d'Ivoire, we have a huge problem of child slaves.

00:44.670 --> 00:49.026
Children have been trafficked from other conflict zones to come and work on the coffee plantations.

00:50.506 --> 00:58.097
Heparin: blood thinner, a pharmaceutical product starts out in artisanal workshops like this in China...

00:59.123 --> 01:02.835
...because the active ingredient comes from pigs' intestines.

01:03.865 --> 01:07.531
Your diamond; you've all heard, probably seen the movie "Blood Diamond".

01:07.777 --> 01:15.171
This is a mine in Zimbabwe right now. Cotton: Uzbekistan is the second biggest exporter of cotton on Earth.

01:15.487 --> 01:20.918
Every year when it comes to the cotton harvest, the government shuts down the schools, puts the kids in buses,...

01:21.530 --> 01:25.370
...buses them to the cotton fields to spend three weeks harvesting the cotton.

01:25.987 --> 01:29.238
It's forced child labor on an institutional scale.

01:31.623 --> 01:35.888
And all of those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in Manila.

01:36.396 --> 01:40.913
These places, these origins, represent governance gaps.

01:41.481 --> 01:44.839
That's the politest description I have for them.

01:45.953 --> 01:50.883
These are the dark pools where global supply chains begin,...

01:51.527 --> 01:55.044
...the global supply chains which bring us our favorite brand name products.

01:56.607 --> 02:01.563
Some of these governance gaps are run by rogue states.

02:02.668 --> 02:05.753
Some of them are not states anymore at all; they're failed states.

02:06.623 --> 02:08.259
Some of them are just...

02:08.753 --> 02:13.563
...countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation is the best way to attract investment,...

02:14.204 --> 02:15.096
...to promote trade.
