00:05.121 --> 00:07.537
It was in the morning after a night raid.

00:13.351 --> 00:14.391
I just found it.

00:17.745 --> 00:18.829
Like I was meant to.

00:27.141 --> 00:29.181
I promised myself that if I made it out,...

00:30.049 --> 00:34.510
...I would find that girl and thank her for saving my life.

00:37.063 --> 00:37.713
I'm Beth.

00:38.411 --> 00:38.910
Logan.

00:39.418 --> 00:40.697
What brings you to Hampton?

00:40.994 --> 00:42.063
It's kind of a long story.

00:42.187 --> 00:44.871
There's a man here who came to apply for the job and I can't get rid of him.

00:45.388 --> 00:46.315
How did you get him to leave?

00:46.448 --> 00:47.523
I gave him the job.

00:47.973 --> 00:49.291
You don't know anything about him.

00:49.695 --> 00:50.427
Neither do you.

00:53.423 --> 00:53.909
Who's that?

00:54.339 --> 00:56.242
That's just somebody that nana hired.

00:56.588 --> 00:57.025
Good night, all!

00:57.201 --> 00:58.292
Do you like jambalaya?

00:58.403 --> 01:00.323
Ben, I'm sure that Logan already has plans.

01:00.425 --> 01:02.017
I can't remember the last time I had a plan.

01:11.934 --> 01:13.899
Well, that's as clean as it will ever be.

01:15.749 --> 01:17.577
You think I don't know what's going on around here?

01:17.663 --> 01:19.504
You don't have a say anymore.

01:19.732 --> 01:21.711
It's just a casual beer between coworkers.

01:22.369 --> 01:23.158
It's not a date.

01:24.151 --> 01:25.695
There's something that I've been meaning to tell you.

01:25.969 --> 01:27.529
I'm sorry, I can't find the right words.

01:29.685 --> 01:31.383
Hey, that's my son in there too, you know.

01:31.532 --> 01:32.466
Let go of my arm.

01:32.639 --> 01:33.884
You should do what she says.

01:34.166 --> 01:35.544
You don't know what I'm dealing with.

01:35.914 --> 01:38.174
I do know that you deserve better than this.

01:38.523 --> 01:40.220
You stay the hell out of my life.

01:43.080 --> 01:46.824
You should be kissed every day, every hour, every minute.

01:48.381 --> 01:49.173
Where did you get this?

01:49.279 --> 01:50.267
Your boy Logan had it.

01:50.371 --> 01:51.271
I should have told you.

01:51.581 --> 01:53.552
I tried. I didn't know how.

01:55.367 --> 01:57.854
He just shows up here with something so personal?

01:57.977 --> 01:59.287
It just doesn't smell right to me.

02:00.076 --> 02:02.179
I think he was meant to find that photo.

02:02.451 --> 02:04.071
I think it can happen for a reason.

02:07.881 --> 02:11.583
How do you explain something that you can't even understand yourself?

02:17.693 --> 02:18.822
Why did you come here?

02:20.234 --> 02:20.992
To find you.
