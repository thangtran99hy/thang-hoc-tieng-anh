All the way from Trenchtown, Jamaica, Bob Marley!

00:11.147 --> 00:11.480
Come on!

00:12.447 --> 00:13.789
Yeah, this is my identity.

00:15.267 --> 00:17.813
It is mentioned in the Bible that there shall be music,...

00:17.933 --> 00:20.431
...that all people shall play and dance, and sing.

00:20.833 --> 00:21.984
What other music could that be?

00:22.165 --> 00:22.573
Reggae.

00:24.651 --> 00:26.249
We come from such a humble beginning,...

00:26.337 --> 00:28.267
...my father would always take us about to Trenchtown.

00:28.363 --> 00:31.537
...would never lock his car; that's like saying you don't trust people.

00:33.541 --> 00:36.578
I was the one that he would call to get women out of his dressing room.

00:36.724 --> 00:38.400
I became his guardian angel.

00:40.974 --> 00:44.094
"All your parents do is smoke and play music."

00:44.373 --> 00:46.707
Nobody wanted their children around us.

00:52.583 --> 00:56.329
The most important thing culturally that was happening in Jamaica at that time...

00:56.534 --> 00:58.697
...was Bob Marley exploding on to the world stage.

00:58.812 --> 01:01.831
There was that sense that he's about to be massive.

01:16.500 --> 01:19.450
My life is only important if I can help plenty of people.

01:19.550 --> 01:21.405
In my life, there's just me and my own security.

01:21.488 --> 01:22.273
There'd be no wanting. 

01:22.392 --> 01:23.571
My life is the people.

01:23.875 --> 01:24.563
Are you a rich man?

01:24.671 --> 01:25.843
You have a lot of possessions?

01:25.971 --> 01:27.125
Possessions make you rich?

01:27.201 --> 01:30.073
I don't have those types of riches; my riches are life.

01:30.493 --> 01:34.576
Love, prosperity: be with us all.

01:35.238 --> 01:37.844
Yeah, Rastafari.

01:38.596 --> 01:39.249
Rasta.
