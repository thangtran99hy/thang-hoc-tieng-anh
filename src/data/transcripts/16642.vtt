00:12.617 --> 00:18.116
Do you hear that? It's the sound of battles fought and lives lost.

00:25.700 --> 00:29.657
It once pained me to know that I am the cause of such despair.

00:34.040 --> 00:38.375
But now their cries give me strength.

00:40.363 --> 00:42.300
Beauty is my power.

00:44.745 --> 00:52.971
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is fairest of them all?

00:54.733 --> 00:59.171
You are the fairest, but there is another destined to surpass you.

01:02.299 --> 01:06.041
Consume her heart and you shall live forever.

01:06.816 --> 01:11.433
Find me someone who doesn't fear the dark forest to hunt her down.

01:14.949 --> 01:16.303
Why is she of such value?

01:16.718 --> 01:18.579
That is none of your concern.

01:18.832 --> 01:19.809
And if I refuse?

01:26.245 --> 01:30.750
Lips red as blood, hair black as night.

01:33.221 --> 01:38.019
Bring me your heart, my dear, dear Snow White.
