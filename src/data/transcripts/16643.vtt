Arrietty, make sure you hold on tight.

00:11.826 --> 00:13.343
Papa, did you see that?

00:13.530 --> 00:14.195
That's my girl.

00:16.813 --> 00:19.001
My mother, father, and I are all borrowers.

00:20.935 --> 00:24.121
Promise you won't let our daughter get eaten, or squashed like a bug.

00:26.697 --> 00:31.391
We borrow things like soap, and cookies, and sugar; things that humans don't miss if they're gone.

00:36.542 --> 00:39.241
We've been seen, and borrowers aren't supposed to be seen.

00:40.741 --> 00:41.229
No, wait.

00:42.277 --> 00:42.763
Don't go.

00:46.396 --> 00:47.637
The boy knows that we're here.

00:48.095 --> 00:49.525
What? Are we safe?

00:50.805 --> 00:52.890
I really don't think he intends to hurt us.

00:53.157 --> 00:57.075
Once a borrower has been seen, the human's curiosity can't be stopped.

00:59.913 --> 01:04.696
My mother used to tell me stories about the little people who lived under the floors.

01:04.999 --> 01:05.554
Is that you?
