Hi! I'm asking you to raise your arms and wave back, just the way I am, kind of a royal wave.

00:18.709 --> 00:20.403
You can mimic what you can see.

00:20.509 --> 00:23.226
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm.

00:23.635 --> 00:26.288
Soon, you'll be able to look inside your brain...

00:26.950 --> 00:30.619
... and program, control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there.

00:30.702 --> 00:32.529
I'm gonna tell you about that technology.

00:32.902 --> 00:37.158
People have wanted to look inside the human mind, the human brain, for thousands of years.

00:37.319 --> 00:41.827
Well, coming out of the research labs just now, for our generation, is the possibility to do that.

00:42.259 --> 00:44.136
People envision this as being very difficult.

00:44.436 --> 00:47.845
You had to take a spaceship, shrink it down, inject it into the bloodstream.

00:47.922 --> 00:49.460
It was terribly dangerous.

00:49.955 --> 00:53.153
You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries.

00:53.760 --> 00:56.507
But now, we have a real technology to do this.

00:56.823 --> 00:59.400
We're gonna fly into my colleague Peter's brain.

00:59.745 --> 01:02.209
We're gonna do it non-invasively using MRI.

01:02.600 --> 01:05.622
We don't have to inject anything. We don't need radiation.

01:06.273 --> 01:09.622
We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter's brain,...

01:09.695 --> 01:12.764
...literally fly into his body, but more importantly, we can look into his mind.

01:12.853 --> 01:16.464
When Peter moves his arm, that yellow spot you see there...

01:16.919 --> 01:19.849
...is the interface to the functioning of Peter's mind taking place.

01:19.908 --> 01:23.386
Now you've seen before that with electrodes, you can control robotic arms,...

01:23.900 --> 01:26.741
...that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains.

01:26.828 --> 01:32.175
What's new is that process has typically taken days or months of analysis.

01:32.300 --> 01:35.937
We've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds, and that allows us...

01:36.033 --> 01:39.775
...to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner.

01:40.066 --> 01:43.769
He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second.

01:43.841 --> 01:47.898
If he can see this pattern in his own brain, he can learn how to control it.
