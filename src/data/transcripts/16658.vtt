We are present in 140 countries, so it's very important to have talent from different cultures...

00:07.409 --> 00:10.972
...and it's such a cosmopolitan place that you can attract...

00:11.433 --> 00:13.546
...retained talent from anywhere in the world.

00:14.746 --> 00:18.775
Out of 18 people who report directly to me, we have 10 different nationalities.

00:19.427 --> 00:23.424
People are very tolerant, very open to difference...

00:23.813 --> 00:25.130
...and I think it's a great attribute.

00:25.663 --> 00:29.009
Here I am, a Frenchman working for an American company,...

00:29.701 --> 00:32.410
...leading an international division based in the UK.

00:32.827 --> 00:35.997
I don't think this would happen easily anywhere else, frankly.

00:37.885 --> 00:41.941
Not only do I like working, but I love living in Britain.

00:46.637 --> 00:48.551
Well apart from the fact that for whatever reason...

00:48.674 --> 00:50.640
...that nobody in the rest of the world understands,...

00:50.828 --> 00:53.038
...you guys are driving on the wrong side of the road,...

00:53.602 --> 00:55.659
...I would say it's very pleasant to drive in the UK.

00:56.520 --> 01:01.947
I think British drivers are careful, are very respectful, polite.

01:04.960 --> 01:08.803
You systematically let pedestrians cross the road...

01:09.764 --> 01:14.713
...and one stops, which is in a big city quite amazing to me compared to other big cities.

01:16.031 --> 01:21.307
The rate of accidents is significantly lower in the UK than it is in other countries...

01:21.623 --> 01:26.610
...which says something significant about the character of the British population.

01:30.676 --> 01:34.528
This being said, I wouldn't say that British people are slaves to the rules;...

01:34.664 --> 01:35.965
...actually, they are very creative.

01:36.205 --> 01:37.795
I think British people can get crazy.

01:40.002 --> 01:44.735
This creativity mixed with the solid structure of tolerance and respect...

01:45.041 --> 01:47.556
...is actually a very good product in the end.

01:49.531 --> 01:53.571
That's what makes it really enjoyable and a unique place.
