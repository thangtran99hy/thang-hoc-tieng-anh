Why do so many people reach success and then fail?

00:23.858 --> 00:26.935
One of the big reasons is, we think success is a one-way street.

00:27.191 --> 00:29.189
So, we do everything that leads up to success.

00:29.583 --> 00:30.454
But then we get there,...

00:30.672 --> 00:31.439
...we figure we've made it,...

00:31.938 --> 00:35.825
...we sit back in our comfort zone and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful.

00:36.297 --> 00:37.946
And it doesn't take long to go downhill.

00:38.945 --> 00:41.723
And I can tell you this happens because it happened to me.

00:43.498 --> 00:46.019
Reaching success, I worked hard, I pushed myself.

00:46.441 --> 00:49.509
But then I stopped because I figured, "Oh, you know, I've made it."

00:49.682 --> 00:51.260
"I can just sit back and relax."

00:51.791 --> 00:54.475
Reaching success, I always tried to improve and do good work.

00:55.361 --> 00:57.265
But then I stopped because I figured,...

00:57.687 --> 00:59.864
..."Hey, I'm good enough. I don't need to improve anymore."

01:00.907 --> 01:04.203
Reaching success, I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas,...

01:04.321 --> 01:08.143
...because I did all these simple things that lead to ideas. But then I stopped.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.225
Because I figured I was this hotshot guy and...

01:10.519 --> 01:13.147
...I shouldn't have to work at ideas. They should just come like magic.

01:13.585 --> 01:15.242
And the only thing that came was creative block.

01:15.695 --> 01:17.391
I couldn't come up with any ideas.

01:18.325 --> 01:22.307
Reaching success, I always focused on clients and projects, and ignored the money.

01:22.901 --> 01:26.157
Then, all this money started pouring in and I got distracted by it.

01:26.575 --> 01:29.493
And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent,...

01:29.710 --> 01:31.550
...when I should have been talking to my clients.

01:32.637 --> 01:34.483
And reaching success, I always did what I loved.

01:35.237 --> 01:38.357
But then I got into stuff I didn't love, like management.

01:38.685 --> 01:41.598
I'm the world's worst manager but I figured I should be doing it.

01:41.707 --> 01:44.251
Because I was, after all, the president of the company.

01:44.917 --> 01:48.337
Well, soon a black cloud formed over my head and here I was,...

01:48.532 --> 01:51.373
...outwardly very successful but inwardly very depressed.

01:52.181 --> 01:56.435
But I'm a guy. I knew how to fix it. I bought a fast car.

02:00.723 --> 02:05.877
It didn't help. I was faster but just as depressed, so I went to my doctor. I said,...

02:06.001 --> 02:11.394
"...Doc, I can buy anything I want. But I'm not happy. I'm depressed."
