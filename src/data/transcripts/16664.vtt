00:00.626 --> 00:02.455
So, I was a C- student in school.

00:02.673 --> 00:04.597
I went to one of the best schools in Washington, DC.

00:05.302 --> 00:08.248
And I think that out of 100 students, I was the 100th student.

00:08.356 --> 00:10.614
I was, at best, a C- student.

00:11.595 --> 00:12.860
But I had a couple of teachers.

00:12.971 --> 00:17.655
One I'll remember forever is, his name is Harvey Lesure, my tenth grade American History teacher.

00:18.311 --> 00:22.383
Even though I was the worst student in the class, Harvey Lesure saw something.

00:22.917 --> 00:28.789
He made me feel, I don't know how he did it, like some great magician...

00:29.289 --> 00:31.750
...he made me feel like I had something to say.

00:32.047 --> 00:34.290
So when I feel like the issue is too complex,...

00:34.727 --> 00:38.622
...too hard to grasp, impossible fixing our schools,...

00:39.641 --> 00:43.460
...I go to the place that I did when I first started making this movie:...

00:43.837 --> 00:46.809
...that we're never gonna have great schools without great teachers.

00:46.908 --> 00:48.751
So if you're looking for a way to get involved,...

00:49.501 --> 00:53.111
...if you're looking for a way to give every kid in America a great education,...

00:53.284 --> 00:54.989
...it starts with great teachers.

00:55.639 --> 00:56.657
Become a teacher.

00:57.432 --> 00:58.220
Help a teacher.

00:58.640 --> 01:02.900
Be part of appreciating the role teachers have in our society.

01:03.307 --> 01:04.345
That is the answer.

01:04.801 --> 01:08.307
We're never going to have great schools without great teachers.
