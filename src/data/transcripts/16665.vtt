00:00.430 --> 00:01.364
That's what I'm working on now.

00:01.467 --> 00:03.084
And to close, I just want to say look, these are tools.

00:03.167 --> 00:05.909
Right now, ProFounder is right at the very beginning and it's very palpable.

00:05.976 --> 00:08.693
It's very clear to me that it's just a vessel, it's just a tool.

00:09.223 --> 00:12.408
What we need are for people to care, to actually go use it...

00:12.481 --> 00:15.049
...just like they've cared enough to use Kiva to make those connections.

00:15.437 --> 00:16.109
But the good news is...

00:16.243 --> 00:18.327
...I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care.

00:18.526 --> 00:19.601
I'm not even going to try.

00:19.946 --> 00:22.386
I don't think we need to be convinced of that; I think we know.

00:22.821 --> 00:24.953
In fact, I think we know so much...

00:25.313 --> 00:27.475
...and it's such a reality that we care so deeply...

00:27.785 --> 00:29.965
...that in fact, what usually stops us is that we're afraid...

00:30.262 --> 00:32.991
...to try and to mess up because we care so very much...

00:33.137 --> 00:35.462
...about helping each other and being meaningful in each other's lives.

00:36.287 --> 00:39.139
So what I think I can do today,...

00:39.709 --> 00:40.847
...the best thing I can give you.

00:41.199 --> 00:43.398
I've given you my story, which is the best I can do.

00:43.831 --> 00:46.631
And I think I can remind us that we do care.

00:46.737 --> 00:47.777
I think we all already know that.

00:48.923 --> 00:49.808
And I think we know...

00:49.950 --> 00:52.543
...that love is resilient enough for us to get out there and try.

00:55.547 --> 00:56.224
Just a sec.

00:58.440 --> 00:58.703
Thanks.

01:03.604 --> 01:08.477
For me, the best way to be inspired to try is to stop and to listen...

01:08.904 --> 01:09.875
...to someone else's story.

01:10.601 --> 01:12.991
And I'm grateful that I've gotten to do that here at TED.

01:14.509 --> 01:16.617
And I'm grateful that whenever I do that,...

01:16.975 --> 01:20.861
...guaranteed, I am inspired; I am inspired by the person I am listening to.

01:21.418 --> 01:24.119
And I believe more and more every time I listen...

01:25.117 --> 01:28.159
...in that person's potential to do great things in the world...

01:28.250 --> 01:29.966
..and in my own potential to maybe help.

01:30.973 --> 01:33.111
That is what can make our stories into love stories...

01:33.187 --> 01:36.759
...and our collective story into one that continually perpetuates hope...

01:37.531 --> 01:38.845
...and good things for all of us.

01:38.933 --> 01:42.103
So that, this belief in each other, knowing that without a doubt...

01:42.401 --> 01:45.107
...and practicing that every day in whatever you do,...

01:45.563 --> 01:48.084
...that's what I believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today.

01:48.681 --> 01:48.929
Thank you.
