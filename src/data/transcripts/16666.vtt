This is Britain through my eyes.

00:34.173 --> 00:37.325
For me, classical music, it's life. It's not work.

00:40.800 --> 00:46.562
Today, I think England is one of the strongest classical music places.

00:48.015 --> 00:50.345
You look at Time Out magazine...

00:50.436 --> 00:56.191
...and you have, I don't know, four or five events that you really want to go to.

00:56.539 --> 00:59.684
It's incredible, the amount of different directions you can go.

00:59.768 --> 01:03.639
You can go into jazz, you can go into early music, you can go with anything.

01:10.655 --> 01:16.398
The first memory, I think I was six and I played in the Bolshoi Theatre, a big hall with an orchestra.

01:16.462 --> 01:20.484
And I played, I think, every year for three or four years.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.156
I wasn't nervous, particularly.

01:24.238 --> 01:28.717
It was, of course at the age of six, you don't realize that the Bolshoi Theatre is important.

01:28.794 --> 01:30.987
So, it was easy. It was fine.

01:34.254 --> 01:37.808
My father got an invitation to play in the London Symphony Orchestra.

01:41.137 --> 01:48.423
So, we all decided to move to England, which of course was a big step for everyone, I think.

01:50.208 --> 01:54.592
My mother or me, we didn't even see the house we were going to live in at that time. We just turned up.

01:58.411 --> 02:01.167
So, I went to a music school, the Yehudi Menhuin School.

02:01.314 --> 02:05.122
And I auditioned and got in at the age of 11...

02:05.439 --> 02:10.368
And of course, as every other child, I loved to perform but not to practice.

02:12.972 --> 02:17.839
And the Menhuin School gave me the ground to decide which way I wanted to go.

02:18.994 --> 02:20.438
It's funny. It seems so much smaller.
