00:03.449 --> 00:05.014
I have to go with "The Godfather."

00:05.587 --> 00:06.478
Mr. Al Pacino.

00:07.799 --> 00:10.808
When he kills the Chief of Police.

00:11.031 --> 00:14.233
Oh man, there's so many, there's so many this year even.

00:14.460 --> 00:15.074
"Goodfellas."

00:15.275 --> 00:16.011
"Paper Moon."

00:16.185 --> 00:17.471
"Chitty, Chitty, Bang, Bang."

00:17.554 --> 00:18.854
Viola Davis in "Doubt."

00:19.165 --> 00:19.713
"Network."

00:20.035 --> 00:22.514
My favorite movie of all time is "Network."

00:22.741 --> 00:25.994
"I'm just mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore."

00:26.381 --> 00:27.863
It was just a revelation.

00:28.147 --> 00:29.757
"You think I'm funny? You think I'm a clown?"

00:30.059 --> 00:31.393
I think that scene is amazing.

00:31.529 --> 00:32.424
"Wizard of Oz."

00:32.593 --> 00:33.808
"Dr. Strangelove."

00:33.933 --> 00:35.535
"Laura" by Otto Preminger.

00:35.610 --> 00:36.337
"The Sound of Music."

00:36.438 --> 00:37.184
"Snow White."

00:37.517 --> 00:39.153
Christopher Plummer singing.

00:39.839 --> 00:42.347
I fell in love with him and I've been in love with him ever since and the movie, so.

00:42.672 --> 00:45.027
"A Hard Day's Night" and my sister nudging me...

00:45.111 --> 00:48.735
...because I was singing too loud along with the songs.

00:48.813 --> 00:50.052
It's the first time I saw "E.T."

00:50.506 --> 00:54.227
I think Kevin Kline in "In and Out".

00:54.695 --> 00:56.449
I wanted him, I wanted E.T.

00:56.904 --> 00:59.307
Marlon Brando of course changed everything.

00:59.676 --> 01:04.205
That was kind of a beginning for me of my love affair with movies...

01:04.418 --> 01:08.591
...and me wanting to be a part of that wonder.
