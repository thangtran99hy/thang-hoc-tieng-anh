At this special dinner organized by a company called Opaque, there's a lot more to your meal than meets the eye.

00:13.679 --> 00:17.643
It's a three to five-course dinner in a completely pitch black dining room setting,...

00:18.066 --> 00:22.647
...so it's really an experience to enhance your many senses...

00:22.713 --> 00:26.890
...and take you on a journey unlike any other dining experience you've ever had.

00:27.173 --> 00:30.035
Diners are completely in the dark, literally.

00:30.359 --> 00:33.591
You can't see where you're going or what you're about to eat.

00:33.843 --> 00:38.556
I'm trying to figure out where I am and how big the room is and who else is in there and what I'm smelling,...

00:38.625 --> 00:40.393
...and it's so different than what you're used to.

00:40.984 --> 00:46.775
Diners are guided through the experience by servers who are the best possible beacons for the journey.

00:47.189 --> 00:48.248
I'm gonna lean on the corner of the table, okay?

00:48.653 --> 00:48.825
Okay.

00:48.891 --> 00:51.647
And here, here's some bread, that's for you.

00:51.707 --> 00:52.516
Okay, I'm on the...

00:52.957 --> 00:53.651
...I'm not, I have my hand.

00:53.794 --> 00:55.420
No, you're not. Here, on this side. There you go.

00:55.485 --> 00:55.829
Okay.

00:56.167 --> 01:02.135
They are all visually impaired themselves and have to find their way in the dark on a daily basis.

01:02.547 --> 01:03.825
That's part of the point.

01:04.133 --> 01:07.341
The food on your plate is also food for thought.

01:07.809 --> 01:12.083
Coming into the diner over an hour and a half to two hours gives them a whole different take.

01:12.601 --> 01:14.664
They're operating in a world where we have the advantage.

01:14.775 --> 01:19.721
We can see and walk on, and all of a sudden, they have the advantage because they can navigate fine.

01:19.952 --> 01:23.047
Actually you're like, "Oh my god, I'd never be able to even function for a second."...
