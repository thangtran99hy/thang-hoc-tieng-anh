Karaoke is helping to heal the wounds of last year's tsunami.

00:11.076 --> 00:16.263
Traditional folk songs are the favorites among the residents of Ofunato's temporary housing.

00:19.575 --> 00:21.571
It is good fun, it heals the heart.

00:24.958 --> 00:28.457
Gathering together in a group and singing and talking to each other is great.

00:31.803 --> 00:38.890
This musical get together is taking place on board a purpose built truck currently touring Japan's tsunami hit coast,...

00:39.318 --> 00:42.801
...bringing counseling and karaoke to the bereaved communities.

00:43.433 --> 00:48.502
Yoshinobu Konno is from the charity 'Friends of the United Nations,' which came up with the idea.

00:50.398 --> 00:55.779
People who live in these small prefabricated houses lost their families and their homes and are often depressed.

00:56.267 --> 00:57.417
So, they are often alone.

00:57.970 --> 01:01.331
They do not want to make contact with other people, they become introspective.

01:01.916 --> 01:05.718
One thing we are concerned about is that people could die here alone in their houses.

01:06.190 --> 01:10.535
So, that is why we are intervening now to try to prevent mental illnesses from taking hold.

01:11.337 --> 01:16.347
This housing block is one of dozens erected in Japan in the months following the tsunami.

01:16.809 --> 01:20.462
Visiting salesmen bring life's essentials and the odd luxury.

01:21.093 --> 01:25.354
In the small cove below, there is nothing left of the residents' original homes.

01:25.835 --> 01:29.935
Demolition teams have flattened the few structures that the tsunami left behind.

01:30.774 --> 01:36.339
Ofunato was one of the worst hit towns when the tsunami roared ashore nearly a year ago.

01:36.927 --> 01:41.491
The bays and headlands of this coastline once famed for its beauty were decimated.

01:42.290 --> 01:48.927
Further south, a freighter still looms over Kesennuma town, carried several kilometers inland by the tsunami.

01:49.481 --> 01:54.675
It is impossible to forget the horrors of a year ago, but the town is trying to move on.

01:55.371 --> 01:58.936
A mini village has sprung up to rehouse businesses washed away.

01:59.421 --> 02:03.693
Chefs and shopkeepers offer a taste of Kesennuma's once famed seafood.

02:04.279 --> 02:06.302
Among them, Masayoshi Hatakeyama.

02:06.791 --> 02:10.134
His traditional Japanese inn was entirely destroyed.

02:10.614 --> 02:15.736
His new workplace may be cramped, but he says it is a first step on a very long road.

02:19.513 --> 02:26.061
The tsunami destroyed a huge area so it would take a long time and hard work to get back to how it was before.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.109
I guess it will not be like it was before.

02:33.726 --> 02:35.229
We will have to create a new town.

02:38.747 --> 02:46.496
Under the direction of a newly formed Ministry of Reconstruction, this wrecked coastline is being transformed with astonishing speed.

02:47.092 --> 02:52.454
Back in Ofunato, survivors say it will take much longer to rebuild their communities.

02:52.921 --> 02:55.955
Many question whether anyone will want to live here at all.
