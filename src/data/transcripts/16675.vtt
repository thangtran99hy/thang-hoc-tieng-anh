Who will come out with a product that is more amazing than the iPad 2,...

00:08.184 --> 00:15.131
...with its big, beautiful 9.7-inch screen, super fast A5 chip, all-day battery life...

00:16.143 --> 00:18.452
...and elegant, thin and light design?

00:19.407 --> 00:21.276
Everybody has been wondering this.

00:22.693 --> 00:24.543
Well, stop wondering.

00:26.176 --> 00:27.069
We are.

00:31.945 --> 00:37.935
Today we're announcing the new iPad and it is amazing.

00:38.563 --> 00:45.821
And we are redefining the category that Apple created with the original iPad.

00:47.084 --> 00:53.564
It makes amazing improvements over the most fundamental features of the design of the device.

00:53.673 --> 00:57.114
A new feature of the new iPad: the retina display.

00:57.775 --> 01:00.280
You might have heard that an iPad could have a retina display,...

01:03.273 --> 01:07.745
...but until you see it, you can't understand how amazing this is.

01:08.857 --> 01:11.799
The second feature: an iSight camera.

01:12.108 --> 01:14.906
It's a five megapixel backside illuminated sensor. 

01:15.319 --> 01:17.937
We brought the optic system from the iPhone 4S.
