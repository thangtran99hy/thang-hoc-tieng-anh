00:00.012 --> 00:12.033
I would like to go ahead and explain first our full year results, and following that I would like to talk about the Q4.

00:13.024 --> 00:17.167
First of all, it was a very good year for us,...

00:17.737 --> 00:22.801
... with the highest levels of sales, operating profit and ordinary profit in Rakuten's history.

00:24.165 --> 00:30.037
These are the five highlights of the 2011 performance.

00:31.143 --> 00:43.799
First of all, Ichiba surpassed one trillion Japanese yen of GMS and is still growing faster than the expanding Japanese e-commerce market.

00:44.365 --> 00:50.888
As a matter of fact, the absolute amount of growth is increasing year by year.

00:51.019 --> 01:02.105
So, it's growing faster than the median line and we have strengthened our international businesses especially our e-commerce businesses.

01:03.435 --> 01:12.245
Third, we executed a very drastic restructuring project of our finance businesses...

01:13.468 --> 01:23.883
...to focus on our high growth credit card business, and basically we expanded our legacy business.

01:24.224 --> 01:27.707
I think we substantially reduced our risk.

01:29.239 --> 01:35.812
Fourth, our operation was very efficient and we controlled our cost very well...

01:36.430 --> 01:42.498
...and we expanded our global technology sites.

01:43.048 --> 01:47.881
This is the top line growth of Rakuten Group on a consolidated basis.

01:48.945 --> 01:56.177
Sales was almost 380 billion in Japanese yen, which is at 15 percent growth.

01:56.480 --> 02:03.697
This is a pro forma basis after adjusting for the spin-off of the KC Card.

02:05.559 --> 02:10.771
And operating profit grew by 18.6 percent.

02:11.242 --> 02:18.347
Again, this is a pro forma basis and it was 75.6 billion Japanese yen.

02:19.669 --> 02:29.120
EBITDA was a bit over 100 billion yen and grew about 15 percent.

02:29.603 --> 02:34.307
So this is the breakdown of each business unit.

02:35.176 --> 02:38.275
Internet service was very, very good.

02:39.363 --> 02:49.337
Sales grew by 203.9 percent. This is the net, excluding deficit costs of the product, grew by 23.5 percent.

02:49.852 --> 02:58.302
And the operating profit grew, EBITDA margin actually. The EBITDA margin grew by 12.8 percent.

02:58.698 --> 03:01.911
And the operating margin grew by 13.2 percent.

03:03.081 --> 03:06.357
The operating profit margin was 32.3 percent.

03:07.284 --> 03:12.841
On the other hand, Internet finance grew by 16.4 percent.

03:13.640 --> 03:20.520
This is excluding the KC Card, which had already spun off and was sold to another company.

03:21.585 --> 03:28.079
But as you can see, in terms of operating profit margin we grew by 46.4 percent.

03:30.483 --> 03:41.169
On a consolidated basis, as you can see after adjustment we grew by 18.6 percent. But on an accounting basis, it was an 11.9 percent growth.

03:42.540 --> 03:44.987
It was a very, very good year for the Rakuten Group.

03:45.287 --> 03:47.647
Edy and credit card grew by 30 percent,...

03:48.295 --> 03:50.721
...travel grew by about 15 percent,...

03:51.149 --> 03:54.611
...and domestic e-commerce grew by about 16.4 percent;...

03:56.197 --> 04:07.157
...especially overseas e-commerce, the international Internet shopping business grew by about 40 percent year-over-year.

04:08.542 --> 04:11.103
We entered into the Indonesia business.

04:12.439 --> 04:16.670
We started the beta site of Rakuten Brazil.

04:18.107 --> 04:22.011
We acquired the business in Germany and in the UK.

04:22.827 --> 04:29.675
As a matter of fact, Germany's site has already changed its domain name and brand name to rakuten.de.

04:32.307 --> 04:47.258
And the other highlight is we are going to increase our dividend payment from 200 yen per share to 250 yen per share.
