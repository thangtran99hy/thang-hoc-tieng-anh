In the days leading up to Valentine's Day,...

00:03.803 --> 00:08.042
...Americans buy some 700 million dollars worth of chocolate treats.

00:08.530 --> 00:11.689
Luscious, creamy and loaded with fat,...

00:12.337 --> 00:16.181
...but recent study shows that dark chocolate can also be good for your heart.

00:16.871 --> 00:21.537
Researchers find that dark chocolate and aspirin have similar effects on the blood,...

00:22.087 --> 00:25.126
...they thin out the blood so it flows more easily.

00:25.731 --> 00:31.209
Even through partially blocked arteries, and that could reduce the possibility of a heart attack.

00:31.857 --> 00:36.161
But for chocolate lovers everywhere, the health benefits are even better than that.

00:36.703 --> 00:39.088
Nutritionist Tammy Roberts explains,...

00:39.154 --> 00:43.058
..."Research shows that we get flavonoids in dark chocolate."

00:43.395 --> 00:46.597
Flavonoids are nutrients found in many different kinds of plants.

00:47.079 --> 00:50.102
They help protect plants against disease and insects,...

00:50.605 --> 00:53.407
...when we eat food with high levels of flavonoids...

00:53.793 --> 00:57.640
...these nutrients trigger our immune systems to produce enzymes,...

00:58.109 --> 01:02.383
...proteins that reduce the risk of some kinds of cancer, heart disease,...

01:02.711 --> 01:04.849
...and some other diseases that come with age.

01:05.467 --> 01:11.103
In fact, 21 scientific studies involving more than 2600 participants...

01:11.490 --> 01:14.273
...examined the effects of dark chocolate on the heart.

01:14.906 --> 01:18.357
The study showed that eating dark chocolate lowered blood pressure...

01:18.785 --> 01:22.093
...and improved the ability of insulin to regulate blood sugar.

01:22.931 --> 01:26.977
Tammy Roberts says flavonoids are also found in something that tastes great...

01:27.149 --> 01:29.887
...when covered with dark chocolate, strawberries.

01:30.350 --> 01:32.824
The health benefits of chocolate-covered strawberries are...

01:33.089 --> 01:37.516
...that both chocolate and strawberries contain antioxidants,...

01:37.853 --> 01:42.123
...and antioxidants are important for immune function and preventing infection.

01:42.755 --> 01:47.135
Roberts says the best Valentine's Day gift combines fruit and chocolate.

01:47.421 --> 01:53.645
When you give your valentine a basket full of fruit that has just a little bit of chocolate...

01:53.847 --> 01:56.799
...then you're really showing them the very best kind of love,...

01:57.093 --> 02:00.940
...because you're giving them a lot of antioxidants and vitamin C,...

02:01.225 --> 02:03.291
...with just enough chocolate to make it exciting.

02:04.068 --> 02:06.039
Just remember to make it dark chocolate.

02:07.005 --> 02:08.931
