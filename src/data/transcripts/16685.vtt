00:01.145 --> 00:03.399
It was another spectacular win...

00:03.560 --> 00:05.463
Lin, the steal to the basket.

00:05.878 --> 00:08.284
...for the man who's become a national phenomenon:...

00:08.427 --> 00:13.671
...Jeremy Lin, 28 points, leading the New York Knicks to yet another victory.

00:14.027 --> 00:15.328
How good is this?

00:15.683 --> 00:20.062
He's packing Madison Square Garden, sending celebrities scrambling to be courtside.

00:20.587 --> 00:23.947
But Lin is still not completely comfortable with his newfound fame.

00:24.063 --> 00:25.750
When was the first time that you realized,...

00:25.815 --> 00:28.335
... "Okay, this isn't just one day; this is a phenomenon."

00:28.747 --> 00:32.343
Five days into it: every site I'm going to, it's like, "Oh, Lin this, Lin that",...

00:32.449 --> 00:35.489
...and it was just a little overwhelming.

00:35.891 --> 00:37.743
What was it like the first time you're just walking around...

00:37.841 --> 00:41.052
...and you see someone wearing your name on a T-shirt or on their jersey.

00:41.886 --> 00:45.271
I was shocked 'cause I actually didn't even know they made my jersey.

00:45.948 --> 00:49.787
I didn't know that they did it that fast, and so when I saw it, I was like,...

00:50.024 --> 00:51.257
..."Did they customize that?"

00:51.428 --> 00:53.614
What's the weirdest paparazzi moment you've had?

00:53.901 --> 00:56.965
Stuff about me dating Kim Kardashian;...

00:57.194 --> 00:59.827
... I mean, I have no idea where that came from.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.564
You don't think you're the Kim Kardashian type?

01:03.812 --> 01:05.583
No, I don't think I'm that type.

01:05.729 --> 01:07.357
You turned down the cover of GQ.

01:07.459 --> 01:09.860
I know there's lots of networks that have been interested in interviewing you.

01:09.962 --> 01:13.014
Why do you think it's so important for you to limit who you sit down and talk to?

01:13.178 --> 01:19.848
I just want to make sure that I'm not doing a disservice to my team by milking all the attention,...

01:19.915 --> 01:23.812
...because at the end of the day, that's not what I love: I love playing basketball.

01:24.175 --> 01:28.481
And while fans have been receptive, Lin is aware that as the NBA's most prominent...

01:28.612 --> 01:31.717
...Asian-American, he still faces certain stereotypes.

01:31.907 --> 01:35.009
People are always saying, "He's deceptively quick, deceptively athletic"...

01:35.093 --> 01:38.839
...and I don't know if that's just because I'm Asian or what it is...

01:38.937 --> 01:40.885
...but obviously there's going to be stereotypes.

01:40.953 --> 01:44.831
I want to be able to represent and be a role model for the Asian-American and the Asian community.

01:45.189 --> 01:47.621
There's already a "Legend of Jeremy Lin" here.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.741
What's your take on the way you've been portrayed?

01:50.158 --> 01:54.184
I have been portrayed as a savior to the organization,...

01:54.312 --> 01:59.354
...and I just respectfully disagree with that.
