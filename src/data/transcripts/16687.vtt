We believe technology is at its very best when it's invisible,...

00:10.515 --> 00:14.548
...when you're conscious only of what you're doing, not the device you're doing it with.

00:15.887 --> 00:18.778
An iPad is the perfect expression of that idea.

00:19.698 --> 00:23.788
It's just as magical pane of glass that can become anything you want it to be.

00:26.051 --> 00:31.852
And that's why so many people in so many different places are using it for so many different things.

00:32.969 --> 00:36.559
It's a more personal experience for technology that people have ever had.

00:38.549 --> 00:42.684
And now, with the new iPad, we're elevating that experience...

00:43.000 --> 00:46.529
...by dramatically improving the fundamental elements that define it.

00:49.193 --> 00:52.975
We gave it a powerful new A5x chip for stunning graphics.

00:53.465 --> 00:57.325
A 5 megapixel iSight camera, with our state-of-the-art optics.

00:58.606 --> 01:00.571
The speed of 4G LTE.

01:01.427 --> 01:08.411
We created an amazing new software that redefines what you can do with music, movies and photos.

01:09.482 --> 01:12.155
And all of this is brought to life on the retina display.

01:13.345 --> 01:15.971
The highest resolution display ever on a mobile device.

01:22.355 --> 01:24.035
The display is what the iPad is all about.

01:24.577 --> 01:27.176
So when you enhance the display, you enhance everything.

01:27.477 --> 01:31.458
And the retina display on the third generation iPad is just spectacular.

01:31.824 --> 01:35.274
It's got the resolution of 2048x1536.

01:35.462 --> 01:37.417
That's 3.1 million pixels.

01:37.651 --> 01:43.727
Four times more than the previous iPad and over a million more than what's called the high-definition on other devices.

01:44.077 --> 01:48.788
And we pack all these pixels into a display that's just 9.7 inches.

01:49.758 --> 01:52.914
But engineering it wasn't as simple as just jamming in more pixels.

01:53.948 --> 01:56.768
A pixel is made up of red, green and blue sub-pixels.

01:57.153 --> 02:00.123
With the signal telling each one when and how much to light up.

02:00.681 --> 02:01.791
That's how colors are created.

02:02.264 --> 02:06.984
But when you squeeze four times the pixels into the same space, signals can get crossed.

02:07.337 --> 02:09.983
Colors become distorted, and images get fuzzy.

02:10.369 --> 02:15.215
To solve this, we had to elevate the pixels onto a different plane and separate them from the signals.

02:16.465 --> 02:17.626
It's a major breakthrough.

02:18.762 --> 02:24.493
And it's the key to making the pixels so small and so close together that the human eye can't even distinguish them.

02:25.138 --> 02:26.894
So, type looks razor-sharp.

02:27.455 --> 02:30.241
And you'll see details in photos that you never knew were there.

02:31.106 --> 02:33.355
A wider color den that brings out even more detail.

02:33.934 --> 02:37.091
It gives you colors that are incredibly rich, deep and vivid.

02:38.555 --> 02:41.543
This isn't just the most advanced display you've ever held in your hand,...

02:42.518 --> 02:44.642
...this is the most advanced display you've ever seen.
