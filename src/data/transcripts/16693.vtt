What would Saint Patrick's Day be without green beer?

00:08.559 --> 00:11.103
Here's how to make it with and without food dye.

00:11.731 --> 00:15.612
You will need a light-colored beer, frosty beer mugs...

00:16.197 --> 00:19.214
...and green food coloring or blue curacao liqueur.

00:19.851 --> 00:23.426
Step one: Chill some 16-ounce beer mugs in the freezer.

00:24.159 --> 00:27.049
Step two: When the glasses are nice and frosty,...

00:27.549 --> 00:30.411
...add a few drops of green food coloring to the bottom of each.

00:31.219 --> 00:34.302
Step three: If you'd prefer not to use food dye,...

00:34.679 --> 00:38.637
...add a shot of blue curacao liqueur to each mug instead of the coloring.

00:39.561 --> 00:43.351
Be sure to add the coloring or the liqueur before you pour the beer,...

00:43.663 --> 00:44.634
...or else you'll have to stir it.

00:45.325 --> 00:49.335
Step four: Pour light-colored ale into the chilled mugs,...

00:49.473 --> 00:52.591
...since beer that's dark to start with will just get darker when dyed.

00:53.242 --> 00:55.241
Add more food coloring if necessary.

00:56.189 --> 01:00.353
Step five : Raise your glass and offer this traditional Irish blessing :...

01:00.995 --> 01:02.455
..."May the road rise to meet you,..."

01:02.943 --> 01:09.339
"...may the wind be always at your back. May the sun shine warm upon your face and rains fall soft upon your fields."

01:09.880 --> 01:13.803
"Until we meet again, may God hold you in the hollow of his hand."

01:14.513 --> 01:15.147
Did you know?

01:15.855 --> 01:20.317
When Saint Patrick was 16 years old, pirates captured him in his native Wales...

01:20.658 --> 01:22.476
...and sold him as a slave in Ireland.
