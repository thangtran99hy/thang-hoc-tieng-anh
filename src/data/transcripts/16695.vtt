He was a great dog, a great friend.

00:18.230 --> 00:19.755
The best dog a kid could have.

00:21.418 --> 00:23.720
When you lose someone you love, they never really leave you.

00:23.941 --> 00:25.933
They just move in to a special place in your heart.

00:27.031 --> 00:29.961
I don't want him in my heart. I want him here with me.

00:31.529 --> 00:31.837
I know.

00:33.829 --> 00:35.381
If we could bring him back, we would.

01:19.185 --> 01:20.087
I'm sorry, boy.

01:31.153 --> 01:31.854
Sparky.

01:34.694 --> 01:35.477
I can't believe it.

01:37.072 --> 01:39.163
Your dog is alive.

01:49.871 --> 01:51.671
Sparky, shh! Easy, boy.

01:57.070 --> 01:57.758
I can fix that.
