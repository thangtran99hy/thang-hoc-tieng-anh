00:07.323 --> 00:11.176
There is more to St. Patrick's Day than drinking green beer and singing "Danny Boy."

00:11.761 --> 00:14.290
Here's how to celebrate it like they do in the old country.

00:15.323 --> 00:20.013
You will need: something green, a church, an Irish soda bread,...

00:20.351 --> 00:25.223
...a lamb stew or Atlantic salmon, Guinness and a four-leaf clover.

00:25.653 --> 00:28.023
Step one: Dress in a little green.

00:28.425 --> 00:29.908
Emphasis on "little."

00:30.550 --> 00:33.839
Dubliners don't go around wrapped head to toe in green with...

00:33.989 --> 00:36.687
..."Kiss me, I'm Irish" buttons and plastic bowler hats.

00:37.493 --> 00:39.141
A splash of green is all you need.

00:42.883 --> 00:45.639
Go ahead and pinch anyone who's not wearing any green.

00:48.385 --> 00:50.162
That's a time-honored tradition in Ireland.

00:53.012 --> 00:54.907
Step two: Go to church.

00:55.498 --> 00:56.639
Yes, you heard us.

00:56.912 --> 00:58.945
The traditional way to honor good old St. Patrick...

00:59.022 --> 01:00.925
...is by attending morning Mass in his honor.

01:01.461 --> 01:05.040
At the very least, pop into a house of worship and say a prayer for someone.

01:05.732 --> 01:11.035
Step three: Greet everyone you meet with a cheery, "Beannachta file padraig oraibh!"...

01:11.209 --> 01:13.663
...which means, "St. Patrick's Day blessing on you."

01:14.004 --> 01:16.363
Try saying that after a few Irish whiskeys.

01:17.095 --> 01:22.780
Step four: Forget those sweet, cake-like loaves that pass as Irish soda bread here in the States.

01:24.494 --> 01:26.149
Find a recipe for the real thing.

01:26.754 --> 01:29.556
Step five: While we're on the subject of food,...

01:29.899 --> 01:33.315
...ditch the corned beef and cabbage and make a lamb stew instead.

01:33.770 --> 01:35.179
Or have some Atlantic salmon.

01:35.586 --> 01:40.517
Both are more Irish than corned beef, which is a decidedly American-Irish dish.

01:41.063 --> 01:43.477
Step six: Forget the green beer.

01:43.883 --> 01:46.449
To get it green, you have to drink the pale stuff,...

01:46.553 --> 01:51.305
...which isn't nearly as traditional as ordering a glass of dark, robust Guinness.

01:52.351 --> 01:57.009
When you raise your glass of Guinness, say "slainte," Gaelic for "to your health."

01:57.774 --> 02:00.771
Step seven: Spend some time with your family.

02:01.157 --> 02:04.523
St. Patrick's Day in Ireland is akin to Thanksgiving Day in America,...

02:04.701 --> 02:06.899
...with the family counting their blessings together.

02:07.225 --> 02:08.420
They even play football.

02:08.890 --> 02:13.699
Well, actually it's a combination of soccer and rugby, but it's called Gaelic football.

02:14.126 --> 02:16.936
Step eight: Make a wish on a four-leaf clover.

02:17.320 --> 02:21.137
Or cast a love spell by thinking of someone while swallowing a four-leaf clover.

02:21.482 --> 02:24.760
It's also said that if you tuck one in the heel of your left shoe,...

02:25.087 --> 02:27.406
...you'll marry the first person who enters the room.

02:27.993 --> 02:29.921
But that seems kind of risky to us.

02:33.907 --> 02:34.686
Did you know?

02:35.125 --> 02:40.353
Americans who claim to be of Irish descent now number more than 34 million,...

02:40.663 --> 02:43.641
...which is more than eight times the population of Ireland today.
