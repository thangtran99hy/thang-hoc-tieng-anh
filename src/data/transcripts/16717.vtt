This year, something new has appeared on the streets of Saudi cities: female shop assistants.

00:06.929 --> 00:09.312
For now, they're only found in lingerie stores.

00:09.652 --> 00:12.188
King Abdullah signed a decree to change the law...

00:12.459 --> 00:17.539
...after years of protest by Saudi women over awkward encounters with male salesmen.

00:20.778 --> 00:24.638
The decision makes it more comfortable for women to have privacy.

00:25.083 --> 00:28.775
And women can speak to the saleswoman and explain their needs better.

00:29.609 --> 00:34.695
At the same time, the female staff connect with women clients better than men.

00:35.271 --> 00:36.871
It avoids embarrassment.

00:37.174 --> 00:43.039
It may seem like a big step but the vast majority of Saudi women are still forbidden from working.

00:43.441 --> 00:48.453
The strict guardian system requires all women to seek the permission of a close male relative...

00:48.778 --> 00:52.032
...to travel, to work, even to have some types of surgery.

00:52.651 --> 00:55.645
Professor Madawi al-Rasheed of King's College London...

00:55.789 --> 01:01.358
...says the place of women in Saudi society is rooted in the strictly religious nature of the state.

01:01.461 --> 01:05.555
Religious nationalism tries to create the kingdom of God on Earth.

01:05.811 --> 01:11.397
And by doing that they use women because they are the visible sign of this nationalism for two reasons.

01:11.543 --> 01:19.259
Women are responsible for reproducing the nation physically, and also reproducing it socially and culturally.

01:19.613 --> 01:22.978
On the surface, those cultural norms appear to be shifting.

01:23.441 --> 01:26.962
In recent months, increasing numbers of women in cities like Riyadh...

01:27.335 --> 01:30.783
...are defying decades of tradition by getting behind the wheel.

01:31.311 --> 01:33.885
So far, authorities have reacted cautiously.

01:34.297 --> 01:38.183
Police generally turn a blind eye unless the act is being filmed.

01:38.711 --> 01:42.881
So are these the first rumblings of a revolution in women's rights?

01:43.078 --> 01:44.070
Absolutely not.

01:44.774 --> 01:50.351
What we have seen is minor protest that is co-opted by the state such as, for example,...

01:50.478 --> 01:53.399
...the lingerie incident or the driving incident.

01:53.727 --> 01:57.085
They are used in order to show that "we have mobilization",...

01:57.437 --> 02:03.684
...in order to show how reformist it is against the background of a conservative tribal society.

02:03.977 --> 02:10.429
So this kind of minor gain that women have, unfortunately, are used for purposes beyond women.

02:10.971 --> 02:17.622
In September of last year, King Abdullah signed a decree allowing women to run and vote in municipal elections.

02:18.080 --> 02:22.190
Al-Rasheed says the reforms are an attempted distraction by the government...

02:22.514 --> 02:26.041
...at a time when other parts of the Arab world are witnessing uprisings.

02:26.175 --> 02:35.634
What we are seeing at this stage is minor protest and separate battles raging in Saudi Arabia.

02:35.909 --> 02:38.793
While some of those battles are being won by women,...

02:39.135 --> 02:46.116
...analysts say the lack of civil society in Saudi Arabia means these are not the first stirrings of a revolution.
