So, if you're in the audience today or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time or place,...

00:20.781 --> 00:23.631
...you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem.

00:24.125 --> 00:30.627
Now whether you're an artist, a technologist, a lawyer or a fan, the handling of copyright directly impacts your life.

00:31.221 --> 00:39.583
A rights management is no longer simply a question of ownership, it's a complex web of relationships and a critical part of our cultural landscape.

00:40.353 --> 00:43.103
YouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners,...

00:43.768 --> 00:48.592
...but in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies, mashups and more,...

00:49.091 --> 00:52.797
...we need to first identify when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site.

00:53.780 --> 00:56.409
Let's look at this specific video so you can see how it works.

00:56.886 --> 01:01.193
Two years ago, recording artist Chris Brown released the official video of his single "Forever."

01:02.173 --> 01:07.224
A fan saw it on TV, recorded it with her camera phone, and uploaded it to YouTube.

01:08.010 --> 01:15.481
Now because Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's video in our Content ID system, within seconds of attempting to upload the video,...

01:15.567 --> 01:19.574
...the copy was detected, giving Sony the choice of what to do next.

01:20.101 --> 01:22.710
But how do we know that the user's video is a copy?

01:23.727 --> 01:31.907
Well, it starts with content owners delivering assets into our database, along with a usage policy that tells us what to do when we find a match.

01:33.544 --> 01:37.921
We compare each upload against all of the reference files in our database.

01:39.003 --> 01:42.071
Now, this heat map is gonna show you how the brain of the system works.

01:42.445 --> 01:47.033
Here we can see the original reference file being compared to the user generated content.

01:48.342 --> 01:52.255
The system compares every moment of one to the other to see if there's a match.

01:52.605 --> 01:57.353
Now, this means that we can identify a match even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file,...

01:57.731 --> 02:01.438
...plays it in slow motion and has degraded audio and video quality.

02:02.807 --> 02:06.668
And we do this every time that a video is uploaded to YouTube.

02:06.823 --> 02:09.374
And that's over 20 hours of video every minute.

02:10.263 --> 02:14.461
When we find a match, we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down.

02:16.007 --> 02:19.618
And the scale and the speed of this system is truly breathtaking.

02:20.611 --> 02:27.928
We're not just talking about a few videos, we're talking about over 100 years of video every day,...

02:28.253 --> 02:33.315
...between new uploads and the legacy scans we regularly do across all of the content on the site.

02:34.667 --> 02:39.911
And we compare those hundred years of video, we're comparing it against millions of reference files in our database.

02:40.339 --> 02:47.543
It would be like 36,000 people staring at 36,000 monitors each and every day, without so much as a coffee break.

02:48.175 --> 02:50.355
Now, what do we do when we find a match?

02:51.876 --> 02:56.259
Well, most rights owners, instead of blocking, will allow the copy to be published.

02:56.525 --> 03:00.413
And then they benefit through the exposure, advertising and linked sales.
