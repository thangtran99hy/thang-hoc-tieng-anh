00:04.956 --> 00:07.180
The piece is titled "Clair de Lune."

00:08.135 --> 00:09.674
Light of the Moon.

00:11.702 --> 00:18.758
In the darkness of his eyes and through the sweetness of his hands, when Patrick Hughes plays,...

00:20.005 --> 00:24.522
...it is the music of possibility and the sound of promise.

00:26.553 --> 00:29.457
How would you describe your disabilities?

00:30.499 --> 00:33.662
Not disabilities at all, more abilities.

00:35.308 --> 00:39.740
Abilities everybody hears and sees at every Louisville football game.

00:40.822 --> 00:43.089
To understand how Patrick Hughes and his father...

00:43.277 --> 00:46.451
...became a two-person member of the Cardinal Marching Band,...

00:47.496 --> 00:49.907
...go back to when the music began.

00:54.523 --> 00:57.911
Born without eyes and with the tightening of the joints...

00:57.991 --> 00:59.952
...that prevents his limbs from ever straightening,...

01:00.789 --> 01:03.257
...Patrick has been blind and crippled from birth.

01:04.947 --> 01:09.981
It is just countless the number of dreams that died, and my wife and I were devastated.

01:10.901 --> 01:11.973
We just asked, "Why us?"

01:12.094 --> 01:13.123
We played by all the rules.

01:13.197 --> 01:13.897
We worked hard.

01:14.569 --> 01:15.575
We just didn't understand.

01:16.059 --> 01:17.909
Kisses for dad.

01:18.313 --> 01:22.175
That heartbreak began to fade even before Patrick's first birthday...

01:22.437 --> 01:26.228
...from his first moments at the family's piano in Louisville, Kentucky.

01:35.226 --> 01:39.063
You could go up and hit a note, no matter where it was on the piano...

01:39.177 --> 01:42.739
...and within one or two tries, he would find that exact note.

01:45.253 --> 01:48.457
By his second birthday, he was playing requests.

01:48.607 --> 01:50.054
Can you play "You're My Sunshine?"

01:57.365 --> 01:58.195
Play "Twinkle?"

02:05.511 --> 02:08.947
I was just ecstatic that you know, "Okay, we're not gonna play baseball,..."

02:09.661 --> 02:12.971
"...but we're gonna play music together and that was really exciting."

02:13.407 --> 02:15.056
Let's see how far we can run with this.

02:16.893 --> 02:23.986
Fitted with artificial eyes and placed in a wheelchair, as Patrick grew, so did his passion and his talent.

02:24.695 --> 02:32.759
He played old standards by grade school and blues numbers by high school.

02:35.366 --> 02:38.356
By the time he arrived at the University of Louisville this year,...

02:38.635 --> 02:41.539
...his musical ability on piano, as well as trumpet,...

02:41.973 --> 02:43.816
...was well-known throughout the city.

02:44.729 --> 02:46.897
I said, "Patrick, you need to be a part of the marching band."

02:48.561 --> 02:52.541
And their reaction was just a little bit of a pause.

02:53.098 --> 02:57.171
My dad and I were hearing this and were like, "Ah, right."

02:57.405 --> 03:00.923
I mean, how in the heck am I supposed to march?

03:01.245 --> 03:05.354
The next step was working out what we needed to make happen...

03:05.441 --> 03:07.577
...in order for Patrick to be involved in the marching band...

03:08.029 --> 03:11.061
...other than just parking on the sidelines and playing his instrument.

03:12.028 --> 03:14.225
I said, "Well, if Dr. Burn is that impassioned about it...

03:14.346 --> 03:17.982
...and Patrick wants to do it, then by golly I'll give it my all as well."

03:19.283 --> 03:23.811
So it was decided, Patrick would play and dad would push.

03:25.245 --> 03:28.244
As part of the 214-member Louisville marching band,...

03:29.972 --> 03:34.127
...a blind and wheelchair-bound trumpet player and his able-bodied father...

03:34.241 --> 03:35.945
...do it all together.

03:37.074 --> 03:43.218
From the pregame drill practice to the march around the stadium,...

03:44.687 --> 03:47.379
...to the half-time performance in front of thousands,...

03:49.892 --> 03:54.973
...dad rolls and rotates his son across the field in mostly perfect formation.

03:56.060 --> 03:59.379
He'll sometimes end up pushing me a little quicker than normal,...

03:59.503 --> 04:03.227
...so that pretty much means, "Hey, he must have done something wrong,..."

04:03.423 --> 04:06.409
"...so he's got to hurry up to get me to the right spot."

04:07.441 --> 04:09.298
Dip, spin...

04:09.400 --> 04:11.514
In order to be at every band practice,...

04:11.599 --> 04:12.810
I'm too slow on the spin.

04:13.317 --> 04:15.795
...and to sit beside his son in every class,...

04:15.885 --> 04:16.135
Question.

04:16.783 --> 04:17.089
Yes?

04:17.445 --> 04:18.386
How do you come up with all the...

04:18.485 --> 04:22.260
...Patrick's father works the graveyard shift for UPS.
