Once upon a time, there lived a Country Mouse.

00:05.715 --> 00:07.774
He liked his rural house.

00:08.941 --> 00:11.345
What a beautiful day!

00:12.443 --> 00:14.753
I like living in the country.

00:15.841 --> 00:17.889
I am waiting for my cousin.

00:19.056 --> 00:20.773
He lives in the city.

00:21.815 --> 00:22.911
Who is that?

00:24.077 --> 00:27.025
Uh, it's my cousin, City Mouse.

00:28.131 --> 00:29.694
Hello there!

00:30.896 --> 00:32.773
Hello, Country Mouse!

00:33.808 --> 00:36.565
This is my house. Please come in.

00:39.023 --> 00:39.979
Thank you.

00:41.097 --> 00:45.345
The Country Mouse prepared lots of barley and beans for dinner.

00:46.527 --> 00:49.837
But the City Mouse didn't like them.

00:50.997 --> 00:54.341
Don't you like barley? Try some.

00:55.746 --> 00:57.917
These are special beans.

00:59.119 --> 01:03.155
How can you put up with such poor food like this?

01:04.177 --> 01:08.339
In the city, I always eat cheese and bread.

01:09.394 --> 01:11.313
I can eat whatever I want.

01:12.369 --> 01:13.492
Isn't it wonderful?

01:14.631 --> 01:16.069
I like the city!

01:17.183 --> 01:19.982
Why don't you come to my house?
