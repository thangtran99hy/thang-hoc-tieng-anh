00:01.107 --> 00:02.155
It is winter.

00:03.305 --> 00:05.051
Tomorrow is Christmas.

00:06.195 --> 00:08.257
And everybody looks happy.

00:09.427 --> 00:10.421
Here is a girl.

00:11.560 --> 00:13.006
A little match girl.

00:14.173 --> 00:15.647
She has no mother.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.413
She has no father.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.232
She wears no coat.

00:22.418 --> 00:24.161
She wears no boots.

00:25.293 --> 00:27.731
She is very, very cold.

00:28.921 --> 00:30.685
She is selling matches.

00:31.875 --> 00:34.835
Matches! Matches for Christmas!

00:36.056 --> 00:37.770
No one listens to her.

00:38.967 --> 00:40.544
No one looks at her.

00:41.770 --> 00:43.059
It starts snowing.

00:44.361 --> 00:46.555
I'm too cold and lonely.

00:47.929 --> 00:49.729
She takes one match out.

00:50.905 --> 00:52.574
I will strike this.

00:53.552 --> 00:55.831
It will give me a warm light.
