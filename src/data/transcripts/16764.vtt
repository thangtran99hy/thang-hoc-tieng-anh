00:00.012 --> 00:01.883
Here is an old man.

00:02.945 --> 00:04.857
He gets a little seed.

00:05.817 --> 00:07.515
He plows his farm.

00:08.551 --> 00:12.735
Grow, grow, little seed. Grow sweet!

00:13.793 --> 00:16.059
He gets up early in the morning.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.513
He waters the seed and says.

00:20.485 --> 00:24.989
Grow, grow, little seed. Grow strong!

00:26.313 --> 00:28.820
The seed grows and grows.

00:29.844 --> 00:33.613
Oh, it's a very big turnip!

00:34.680 --> 00:36.557
The old man is happy.

00:37.507 --> 00:39.853
The old woman is happy, too.

00:40.848 --> 00:43.577
The turnip gets bigger and bigger.

00:44.575 --> 00:46.915
It becomes a great turnip.

00:47.901 --> 00:51.299
Now, it's time to pull up my turnip.

00:52.299 --> 00:54.546
He starts to pull up his turnip.

00:55.516 --> 00:57.270
But it doesn't move.

00:58.120 --> 00:59.349
I need some help.

01:00.317 --> 01:03.143
Honey! Come and help.

01:04.236 --> 01:05.653
He calls his wife.
