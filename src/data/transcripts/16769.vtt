00:00.634 --> 00:02.860
Here is a poor shoemaker.

00:03.925 --> 00:06.077
He makes shoes in his shop.

00:07.196 --> 00:09.913
This is all the leather I have.

00:11.117 --> 00:14.856
I can only make one pair of shoes.

00:16.038 --> 00:20.139
You look tired. Begin the work tomorrow.

00:21.258 --> 00:24.849
Next morning, there is something on the table!

00:25.906 --> 00:26.612
Look!

00:27.709 --> 00:29.965
The shoemaker's wife shouts.

00:31.189 --> 00:33.892
A beautiful pair of shoes!

00:35.032 --> 00:37.540
Did you make these shoes?

00:38.651 --> 00:42.018
No, I didn't. It is magic.

00:43.116 --> 00:46.164
Then, a man comes into the shop.

00:47.263 --> 00:49.819
Oh, these are so beautiful!
