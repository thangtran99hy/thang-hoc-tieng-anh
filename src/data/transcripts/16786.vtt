00:00.695 --> 00:02.811
Here is a young woodcutter.

00:03.937 --> 00:05.819
His name is Thaddeus.

00:06.924 --> 00:09.605
He is ugly, but very kind.

00:10.687 --> 00:13.152
Now, he is cutting down trees.

00:17.658 --> 00:21.671
Whew! This is hard work.

00:25.126 --> 00:28.764
I'm tired and hungry.

00:30.082 --> 00:34.807
When Thaddeus is eating lunch, an old man comes to him.

00:37.092 --> 00:39.066
I'm so hungry.

00:39.495 --> 00:42.423
Would you give me some bread?

00:43.630 --> 00:45.720
Thaddeus gives him some bread.

00:46.877 --> 00:49.172
"You are very kind.",...

00:50.329 --> 00:51.847
...says the old man.

00:53.101 --> 00:56.115
I'm the wizard of the woods!

00:57.470 --> 00:59.888
I want to give you a gift.

01:01.067 --> 01:02.865
Cut down that tree.

01:03.974 --> 01:06.400
Thaddeus cuts down the tree.

01:07.551 --> 01:09.765
And he finds something in the roots.

01:10.950 --> 01:16.023
Wow! A golden goose!

01:17.203 --> 01:19.223
Thaddeus decides to take it.
