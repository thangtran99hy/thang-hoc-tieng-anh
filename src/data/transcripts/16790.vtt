00:00.314 --> 00:03.055
There is the Happy Prince in this city.

00:04.075 --> 00:06.387
He is a beautiful statue.

00:07.427 --> 00:09.165
Everyone admires him.

00:10.219 --> 00:12.043
He is covered with gold.

00:13.136 --> 00:15.690
His eyes are blue sapphires.

00:16.701 --> 00:19.274
A big ruby is on his sword.

00:20.307 --> 00:23.569
One day, a Swallow comes to the city.

00:24.570 --> 00:29.662
The Swallow decides to stay between the feet of the Happy Prince.

00:30.697 --> 00:34.761
Then, some drops of water fall on the Swallow.

00:35.701 --> 00:38.868
They are the tears of the Happy Prince.

00:39.911 --> 00:42.885
The Swallow asks the Happy Prince.

00:43.929 --> 00:45.611
Why are you crying?

00:46.622 --> 00:48.401
The Prince answers.

00:49.465 --> 00:52.533
When I was alive, I never cried.

00:53.598 --> 00:55.141
I was always happy.
