00:00.031 --> 00:01.532
Here is a lion.

00:02.426 --> 00:05.047
He is the king of the animals.

00:05.940 --> 00:09.103
Today, he doesn't feel good.

00:10.129 --> 00:12.678
I feel so bad.

00:13.481 --> 00:17.143
Hmm, what can I do?

00:18.106 --> 00:21.325
I know, I'll call up the animals.

00:22.283 --> 00:25.418
Soon three animals come to the lion.

00:26.333 --> 00:29.441
They are a sheep, a wolf and a fox.

00:30.372 --> 00:33.052
Are you there, Mr. Lion?

00:33.914 --> 00:34.914
Come in.

00:35.893 --> 00:38.393
The sheep goes up to the lion.

00:39.371 --> 00:42.298
How are you doing, Mr. Lion?

00:43.303 --> 00:45.239
You look so pale.

00:46.311 --> 00:49.193
I don't feel good today.

00:50.232 --> 00:54.255
Sheep, I have a question for you.

00:55.134 --> 00:57.045
Tell me everything.

00:58.055 --> 01:00.876
Do you always tell the truth?

01:01.919 --> 01:04.298
Yes, sir! Always.
