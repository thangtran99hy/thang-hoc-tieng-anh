A mother pig and her three little pigs live in a house.

00:05.361 --> 00:08.153
The three little pigs play in the yard.

00:09.095 --> 00:14.581
One, two, three, four, five.

00:15.363 --> 00:18.257
The first little pig is so lazy.

00:19.259 --> 00:23.255
The second little pig likes to make everything pretty.

00:23.948 --> 00:28.009
The third little pig is so wise and diligent.

00:28.923 --> 00:31.522
Dears! Come here!

00:32.415 --> 00:34.786
Boys, listen to me.

00:35.816 --> 00:38.955
It's time for you to live alone.

00:39.930 --> 00:41.846
Live alone?

00:42.689 --> 00:46.655
Yes. You're not babies anymore.

00:47.529 --> 00:50.437
You must build your own houses.

00:51.371 --> 00:54.794
Watch out for the big bad wolf.

00:55.694 --> 00:58.651
He likes to eat little pigs.

00:59.539 --> 01:00.685
Okay.

01:01.691 --> 01:03.678
Okay, I will.

01:04.669 --> 01:07.049
I'll build a straw house.

01:08.058 --> 01:10.447
I want to make it quickly.

01:11.221 --> 01:15.161
The first little pig builds a house out of straw.
