00:00.015 --> 00:10.847
Let us look at it in context, I mean, so let's say, that's something like 20 years more, 25 years of the UK science budget.

00:12.011 --> 00:16.138
That's how much that is, a quarter of a century of UK science spending.

00:16.493 --> 00:23.955
Now in that time, spending that money, UK engineers have done things like we... I mean, CERN is an example.

00:24.051 --> 00:28.080
We've invented, we invented the World Wide Web, which revolutionized the world.

00:28.787 --> 00:37.922
The list is endless. I mean we, you know, modern era engine technology, life expectancy is increasing beyond anyone's expectation.

00:38.325 --> 00:39.574
This is how they'll spend.

00:39.913 --> 00:45.459
We're talking about single figure billions in research budgets, in every government, all across the world.

00:45.849 --> 00:53.487
I mean the UK actually is a very successful and very efficient spender of money but the research budget is about three billion.

00:53.826 --> 00:55.697
Three billion pounds, think about that.

00:56.049 --> 00:58.438
And then, compare that to what Apple have got in the bank account.

00:58.751 --> 01:01.633
So you're absolutely right. Apple as a company...

01:02.079 --> 01:07.367
...could reignite a Victorian age of engineering.

01:07.494 --> 01:10.357
Right there they could do it because that's the amount of money you need to do it.

01:10.865 --> 01:17.760
So I, yeah, I agree with you completely, we need a shift in the way that we think about investment and R&D.

01:18.156 --> 01:18.768
Should they do it?

01:20.006 --> 01:23.813
Well, I think they should and their shareholders might have some objection, but that is the way.

01:24.135 --> 01:32.404
This is why government has a key role because the role of government in my view is to allocate capital in the economy for the good of everybody...

01:32.735 --> 01:34.260
...and not just for the good of the shareholders.

01:34.348 --> 01:41.942
So, some combination, some way of investing more money on this which is self-evidently the thing that we need to do.

01:42.349 --> 01:51.434
Not only as the UK or the US or wherever you're watching this program, as a civilization, it's obvious that we need to invest more in engineering and R&D.

01:51.837 --> 01:59.245
You need a big industrial import and I'm thinking that some of the great discoveries, I mean look at the transistor, for example.

01:59.779 --> 02:05.955
That's always been associated with Bell Labs, this great US industrial research facility.

02:06.420 --> 02:11.194
What crucially, I think there's a lesson here, because that was curiosity led research.

02:11.668 --> 02:18.585
And I think one of the problems we occasionally have, or often have actually, is that industry can tend to be very focused.

02:18.827 --> 02:25.502
There's a very famous quote often raised, which is that, "The electric light wasn't invented by continuous R&D on the candle."

02:26.057 --> 02:28.159
You needed some step changed.

02:28.505 --> 02:37.887
And so, I think as long as, you don't, industry is not purely associated with this targeted research, it's driven to particular problems.

02:38.226 --> 02:43.801
And indeed actually government-funded research because government falls into this trap, it's one of, it's a terrible trap to fall into.

02:44.179 --> 02:47.502
What you need really, is you need engineers, you need scientists.

02:47.762 --> 02:49.664
You need to let their curiosity run wild.

02:49.935 --> 02:53.797
You need to let them to go and play, literally play on the edge of our knowledge.

02:54.105 --> 02:56.493
And time and again we found whether that's in a big lab...

02:56.609 --> 03:02.145
...or big industrial setting or government-funded setting or even a single person in the university or elsewhere,...

03:02.496 --> 03:06.406
...when you allow that to happen, then you get paradigm shifts which change everybody's life.
