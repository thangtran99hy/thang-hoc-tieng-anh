00:01.605 --> 00:04.899
One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That's all.

00:06.016 --> 00:08.955
Della counted it already three times.

00:10.070 --> 00:11.255
What can I do?

00:11.423 --> 00:13.286
I can't buy anything with this.

00:14.421 --> 00:17.577
Della had saved every penny she could for months.

00:18.694 --> 00:22.338
But there was only one dollar and eighty-seven cents!

00:23.441 --> 00:26.828
Suddenly, Della walked to a mirror on the wall.

00:27.967 --> 00:29.627
She stood before the mirror.

00:30.772 --> 00:32.891
She pulled down her hair carefully.

00:34.007 --> 00:37.170
It was shining like a cascade of golden water.

00:38.301 --> 00:41.206
Della put on an old coat and went out.

00:42.342 --> 00:45.142
After a while, she arrived at a shop.

00:46.273 --> 00:49.637
Merry Christmas! May I help you?

00:50.705 --> 00:52.225
Will you buy my hair?

00:53.299 --> 00:55.235
Let's have a look at it first.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.083
Please take your hat off.
