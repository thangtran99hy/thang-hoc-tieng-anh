00:00.643 --> 00:04.404
Once upon a time, three bears lived in the forest.

00:05.515 --> 00:07.642
Father Bear was very big.

00:08.658 --> 00:11.400
Mother Bear was smaller than Father Bear.

00:12.521 --> 00:15.250
And Baby Bear was the smallest.

00:16.399 --> 00:20.479
One day, Mother Bear made some porridge for breakfast.

00:21.589 --> 00:24.897
Well, it's too hot to eat right now.

00:25.979 --> 00:30.037
Then, let's take a walk until the porridge gets cool.

00:31.293 --> 00:33.399
We can eat the porridge later.

00:34.570 --> 00:37.879
The three bears went for a walk in the forest.

00:39.027 --> 00:43.670
At the same time, Goldilocks was walking in the forest.

00:44.799 --> 00:47.283
She was a very naughty girl.

00:48.479 --> 00:50.103
Where is it coming from?

00:51.260 --> 00:55.178
Goldilocks saw a small house with a red roof.

00:56.289 --> 00:59.292
Huh! What a nice house it is!

01:00.453 --> 01:02.767
It was the three bears' house.

01:03.901 --> 01:07.629
Hello! Hello!

01:08.719 --> 01:10.378
There was no answer.

01:11.533 --> 01:16.198
Goldilocks opened the door and went into the bears' house.

01:17.318 --> 01:20.649
Wow, porridge! I love it!

01:21.811 --> 01:25.443
She tried some porridge from the very big bowl.

01:26.533 --> 01:28.829
It was Father Bear's porridge.

01:29.983 --> 01:33.542
It's very hot! I don't like it.

01:34.712 --> 01:39.104
Next, Goldilocks tasted some porridge from the smaller bowl.

01:40.251 --> 01:42.343
It was Mother Bear's porridge.

01:43.413 --> 01:46.144
This porridge is very cold!

01:47.257 --> 01:51.154
Then, she tried some porridge from Baby Bear's bowl.

01:52.277 --> 01:54.577
I like this.

01:55.821 --> 01:59.295
It's not too hot and it's not too cold.

02:00.443 --> 02:04.140
Goldilocks ate all of Baby Bear's porridge.
