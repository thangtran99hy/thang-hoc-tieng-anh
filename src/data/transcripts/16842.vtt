There lived a girl named Dorothy in Kansas.

00:04.468 --> 00:08.099
One night, she was sleeping with her dog, Toto.

00:09.147 --> 00:15.925
Suddenly, a big tornado hit Kansas and made Dorothy's house fly away.

00:16.965 --> 00:20.136
After a long time, Dorothy woke up.

00:21.113 --> 00:23.689
Oh! Where am I?

00:24.671 --> 00:26.754
Thank you very much!

00:27.858 --> 00:31.304
You got rid of the Wicked Witch of the East!

00:32.379 --> 00:33.453
Don't be afraid.

00:34.408 --> 00:35.915
She is the Wicked Witch.

00:36.939 --> 00:38.627
Thank you, Dorothy!

00:39.561 --> 00:41.494
But where am I?

00:42.341 --> 00:44.196
How can I get home?

00:45.225 --> 00:50.201
Well, go to the Wizard of Oz in the Emerald city.

00:51.151 --> 00:54.684
He probably knows how to get you home.

00:55.589 --> 01:00.311
Also, here are the Wicked Witch's silver shoes.

01:01.267 --> 01:04.757
Put these on, and they will help you.

01:05.680 --> 01:08.679
This is the only way to the city.

01:09.645 --> 01:12.773
It was a road made of yellow bricks.

01:13.704 --> 01:15.232
Goodbye, everyone!

01:16.240 --> 01:18.240
Goodbye, Dorothy!

01:19.218 --> 01:23.273
Dorothy and Toto started for the Emerald City.

01:24.360 --> 01:29.395
On the road, they came to a scarecrow who was stuck on a pole.

01:30.385 --> 01:32.018
Hi, pretty girl!

01:32.906 --> 01:35.077
Uh? Who's there?

01:36.008 --> 01:37.737
It's me! Here!

01:38.871 --> 01:42.131
Would you help me get down from this pole?

01:43.198 --> 01:45.201
Ah, okay!

01:46.180 --> 01:47.423
Thanks a lot.

01:48.371 --> 01:51.539
By the way, where are you going?

01:52.682 --> 01:57.655
We're going to the Emerald City to meet the Wizard of Oz.

01:58.684 --> 02:04.153
People say that he is the only one who can help us get back home.
