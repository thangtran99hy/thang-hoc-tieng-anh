00:00.637 --> 00:04.838
Once upon a time, there lived a man named Geppetto.

00:05.901 --> 00:07.969
He was old and lonely.

00:09.139 --> 00:12.450
One day, Geppetto was making a puppet.

00:13.605 --> 00:15.827
I'll call you Pinocchio.

00:17.089 --> 00:19.587
I wish you were a real boy.

00:20.695 --> 00:23.314
Then the Blue Fairy appeared.

00:24.453 --> 00:27.181
Geppetto, you are a good man.

00:28.245 --> 00:30.113
I'll grant you your wish.

00:31.185 --> 00:34.035
She touched Pinocchio with her wand.

00:35.175 --> 00:36.721
"Wake up, Pinocchio.",...

00:37.876 --> 00:39.146
...the Fairy said.

00:40.378 --> 00:46.129
If you are brave, truthful and unselfish, you will be a real boy.

00:47.349 --> 00:51.120
The next day, Pinocchio wanted to go to school.

00:52.214 --> 00:53.591
Here is your book.

00:54.853 --> 00:56.569
Go to school quickly.

00:57.693 --> 00:59.730
Thank you, dad. Good-bye.

01:01.019 --> 01:04.683
On the way to school, Pinocchio saw a show.

01:05.777 --> 01:06.694
What's that?

01:07.849 --> 01:09.549
A great puppet show!

01:10.657 --> 01:13.063
Pinocchio forgot about school.

01:14.341 --> 01:17.237
Lock Pinocchio in a cage.

01:18.500 --> 01:22.057
I need him to get a lot of money!

01:23.228 --> 01:24.774
The show was finished.

01:25.959 --> 01:28.902
Let me go! Let me go, please!
