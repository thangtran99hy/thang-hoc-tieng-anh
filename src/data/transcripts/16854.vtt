Well George, you seem to be making real progress.

00:06.067 --> 00:09.853
Have you been tempted to uninstall Internet Explorer from anyone's computer recently?

00:10.610 --> 00:14.481
Not recently. I mean, I used to do it all the time.

00:14.842 --> 00:18.827
Oh God, Mom! You're not using Internet Explorer, are you?

00:19.086 --> 00:20.806
Yes, I'm working on my blog.

00:21.131 --> 00:24.602
George! It was about Gluten Free Gingerbread Houses.

00:24.687 --> 00:26.615
I'm telling you mom, this browser is ancient.

00:26.918 --> 00:29.492
The only thing that Internet Explorer is good for...

00:29.619 --> 00:31.627
Come back over here whatever your name is.

00:31.711 --> 00:32.695
Don't interrupt me, Nancy.

00:33.113 --> 00:36.294
The only thing that it is good for at all - uninstalled!

00:36.496 --> 00:40.220
The only thing it is good for at all is downloading other browsers.

00:42.229 --> 00:43.626
Now, you've gotten over that sickness.

00:44.156 --> 00:47.457
Yeah, because IE 9 is actually good.

00:47.798 --> 00:53.204
Great! So now, we can finally get into your very disturbing relationship with your cat.

00:54.261 --> 00:56.613
She's not a cat, she's a policewoman.

00:58.642 --> 01:00.752
Her name is Officer Cupcake.

01:06.149 --> 01:06.628
What are you writing down?
