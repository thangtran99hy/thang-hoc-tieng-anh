Once upon a time, a donkey lived on a small farm.

00:05.709 --> 00:08.329
He carried lots of loads every day.

00:09.391 --> 00:11.396
But he was old and weak.

00:12.554 --> 00:16.582
One day, he fell in the river on his way to the market.

00:20.829 --> 00:22.100
Oh my god!

00:23.223 --> 00:25.081
You've spoiled my flour.

00:26.209 --> 00:31.208
The farmer was very angry and he chased his donkey away.

00:35.425 --> 00:38.291
The donkey walked for quite a while.

00:39.455 --> 00:43.438
Right! All the best musicians live in Bremen.

00:44.724 --> 00:47.117
I will go to Bremen!

00:48.319 --> 00:50.063
He sat under a tree.

00:51.114 --> 00:54.578
Suddenly, there was a howl from the ground.

01:01.222 --> 01:04.873
Oops! Oh, I'm sorry.

01:06.073 --> 01:07.437
I didn't mean it.

01:08.504 --> 01:10.049
Never mind.

01:11.183 --> 01:13.083
What's wrong with you?

01:14.225 --> 01:16.533
You look so sad.

01:17.627 --> 01:19.872
I'm too old to hunt.

01:21.301 --> 01:23.587
My master kicked me out.

01:24.733 --> 01:26.645
Dog, cheer up!

01:27.822 --> 01:31.481
I'm going to Bremen to be a musician.

01:32.563 --> 01:34.409
Will you come with me?

01:35.469 --> 01:36.900
A musician?

01:38.039 --> 01:41.843
Yes, I'll start a musical band.

01:43.047 --> 01:44.952
I'll play the guitar.

01:46.035 --> 01:47.669
That's a good idea.

01:49.073 --> 01:51.335
I can play the drums!

01:52.439 --> 01:56.146
The donkey and the dog set off for Bremen.
