Congratulations, book nerds!

00:01.896 --> 00:06.915
Your 2010 hard copy edition of Encyclopedia Britannica may someday be collectible.

00:07.346 --> 00:11.489
The venerable company has announced it will stop publishing new editions for the first time...

00:11.781 --> 00:15.249
...since it started over 200 years ago in Edinburgh, Scotland.

00:15.615 --> 00:16.287
The reason?

00:16.703 --> 00:20.723
Britannica has gone digital and publishers say it's time to retire the version...

00:20.798 --> 00:22.815
...that can also double as a weight set.

00:23.394 --> 00:25.836
This has nothing to do with Wikipedia or Google,...

00:25.903 --> 00:29.449
...the Encyclopedia Britannica Inc. president told the Associated Press.

00:29.729 --> 00:35.407
Instead the company, which claims its online version currently serves over 100 million people worldwide,...

00:35.619 --> 00:39.507
...says the move reflects the fact that its digital sales are the future.

00:40.018 --> 00:44.324
Hard copy sales peaked at 120,000 sets way back in 1990.

00:44.917 --> 00:49.893
To celebrate the transition, Britannica will offer a week's free access to its online content,...

00:50.352 --> 00:53.760
...written and edited by the likes of Bill Clinton and Desmond Tutu.

00:54.413 --> 01:00.164
Will Britannica also get that geeky kid from the 90s to do a set of online ads for the digital versions?

01:00.564 --> 01:01.269
We hope so!

01:01.679 --> 01:03.983
This is the greatest encyclopedia in the world.

01:04.224 --> 01:05.227
Help me get a B+.

01:05.349 --> 01:06.026
Why not an A?

01:06.325 --> 01:06.832
Too long!
