00:00.011 --> 00:02.924
Once upon a time, there was a Sea King.

00:03.958 --> 00:08.259
He lived in a splendid palace in the deepest ocean.

00:09.289 --> 00:11.048
He had five daughters.

00:11.969 --> 00:14.539
They were very beautiful mermaids.

00:15.808 --> 00:21.352
But the youngest mermaid, Angella, was the loveliest of them all.

00:22.292 --> 00:24.708
She had a beautiful voice.

00:25.807 --> 00:27.859
Did you see the sky?

00:28.813 --> 00:31.580
Sure, it was fantastic!

00:32.557 --> 00:35.181
Did you hear the voices of humans?

00:36.173 --> 00:37.317
Of course.

00:38.296 --> 00:41.337
It was a little strange but beautiful.

00:42.399 --> 00:45.802
I like to hear about the world above the sea.

00:46.842 --> 00:49.819
I want to go up there and see the sky!

00:50.845 --> 00:52.466
You're still too young!

00:53.559 --> 00:56.934
I'll let you go up there when you turn fifteen.

00:57.995 --> 01:00.328
Humans are very dangerous.

01:01.359 --> 01:04.595
Never go to the surface without my permission!

01:05.552 --> 01:06.501
Dad!

01:07.557 --> 01:12.657
The Little Mermaid waited and waited for her fifteenth birthday.

01:13.741 --> 01:18.127
She spent her time wishing to see the world of humans.

01:19.148 --> 01:23.343
At last, the Little Mermaid's fifteenth birthday came.

01:24.310 --> 01:26.507
Now you can go to the surface.

01:27.523 --> 01:29.732
You'll breathe air and see the sky.

01:30.827 --> 01:33.664
Be careful and keep away from humans.

01:34.745 --> 01:35.987
Yes, dad!
