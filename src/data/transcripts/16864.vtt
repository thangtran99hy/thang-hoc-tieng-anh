00:01.155 --> 00:02.741
It couldn't really end like this, could it?

00:03.491 --> 00:05.239
Not after what I'd just been through.

00:06.212 --> 00:07.347
We're gonna get through this, right?

00:08.333 --> 00:10.795
We're gonna be together forever, right?

00:12.585 --> 00:14.271
I'm starting to think otherwise.

00:22.111 --> 00:23.630
Maybe Justin Bieber was right.

00:24.436 --> 00:26.489
Maybe there was no Juliet for this Romeo.

00:26.913 --> 00:29.590
No Meg Ryan for this Tom Hanks.

00:31.038 --> 00:32.811
Maybe there was no such thing as love.

00:34.943 --> 00:40.358
And just as I was about to resign myself to a life of cat ownership, I saw her.

00:42.062 --> 00:43.797
The girl of my dreams.

01:05.590 --> 01:06.499
I had to think fast.

01:07.147 --> 01:09.894
A train leaves the station travelling at 27 miles per hour.

01:10.523 --> 01:12.499
The next station is 14 city blocks away.

01:13.111 --> 01:16.441
If a man leaves that same station on foot but takes one massive shortcut,...

01:17.599 --> 01:19.049
...will he spend the rest of his life alone?

01:56.911 --> 01:58.267
I was incredibly out of shape.

01:59.116 --> 02:02.740
But every fiber of my being told me I couldn't let this one go.

02:03.577 --> 02:04.680
I had to keep pushing.

02:05.159 --> 02:07.503
I was going to make it!

02:12.832 --> 02:14.633
I wasn't going to make it.

02:16.966 --> 02:17.692
What was this?

02:19.261 --> 02:19.746
Wait a minute!

02:22.587 --> 02:23.916
Bieber!

02:42.619 --> 02:44.886
And just like that, she was gone.

02:46.401 --> 02:47.857
The next station wasn't for miles.

02:48.643 --> 02:51.544
I had nothing left but a flat tire and a broken heart.

03:19.260 --> 03:20.951
It couldn't really end like this, could it?

03:21.617 --> 03:23.398
Not after what I'd just been through.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.435
We're gonna get through this, right?

03:26.488 --> 03:28.805
We're gonna be together forever, right?

03:30.505 --> 03:32.193
I'm starting to think otherwise.

03:33.862 --> 03:35.289
Maybe Justin Bieber was right.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.651
Maybe there was no Juliet for this Romeo.

03:38.743 --> 03:41.053
No, no Courtney Love for this Kurt Cobain.

03:41.859 --> 03:43.642
Maybe there was no such thing as love.

03:46.034 --> 03:50.163
And just as I was about to renew my World of Warcraft membership, I saw her.

03:52.207 --> 03:53.947
The girl of my dreams.
