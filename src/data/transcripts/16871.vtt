A long time ago, there lived a princess in a beautiful country.

00:06.826 --> 00:08.697
She was young and lovely.

00:09.749 --> 00:11.520
She liked playing with a ball.

00:12.679 --> 00:17.903
What about this golden ball for princess' birthday present?

00:18.999 --> 00:22.369
That's a good idea! She will love it.

00:23.369 --> 00:27.994
On the princess' birthday, the king gave the golden ball to her.

00:29.121 --> 00:32.792
Wow, it's beautiful. I love it!

00:34.172 --> 00:35.278
Thank you, dad.

00:36.418 --> 00:40.026
The golden ball became the princess' favorite toy.

00:41.327 --> 00:46.661
One day, the princess was playing with her golden ball by a pond.

00:47.757 --> 00:50.463
La, la, la, la.

00:51.985 --> 00:56.749
The princess threw up the golden ball and caught it as it fell.

00:58.747 --> 01:01.087
I can throw it much higher.

01:02.151 --> 01:06.150
But she threw it up so high that she couldn't catch it.

01:07.308 --> 01:10.679
Uh-uh, oh no!

01:11.929 --> 01:14.413
The golden ball fell into the pond.

01:15.524 --> 01:17.725
The princess began to cry.

01:18.931 --> 01:22.887
Oh, my golden ball.

01:24.009 --> 01:26.038
What am I going to do?

01:28.616 --> 01:30.926
She cried louder and louder.

01:32.053 --> 01:34.326
The princess couldn't stop crying.

01:35.453 --> 01:39.694
Just then, a frog came out of the pond and said.

01:40.851 --> 01:44.159
Lovely princess, why are you crying?

01:45.365 --> 01:47.705
Uh? How amazing!

01:48.737 --> 01:50.635
The frog is speaking!
