00:00.543 --> 00:03.597
Many many years ago, there lived an Emperor .

00:04.716 --> 00:07.281
He loved new clothes very much.

00:08.337 --> 00:10.835
He would spend all his money on them.

00:11.933 --> 00:14.203
He did not care for his country.

00:15.297 --> 00:18.568
Nothing could please him except new clothes.

00:19.662 --> 00:21.180
Throw them away!

00:22.237 --> 00:26.265
By the way, the city which he ruled was full of life.

00:27.301 --> 00:32.513
Many strangers from all over the world visited this city every day.

00:33.519 --> 00:36.787
One day two swindlers came to the city.

00:37.861 --> 00:42.030
Do you know that the Emperor is looking for some new clothes?

00:43.095 --> 00:47.389
Again? He hired a famous designer a few weeks ago!

00:48.544 --> 00:51.824
Right. But the Emperor got sick of his clothes.

00:53.018 --> 00:58.953
This time, he will reward lots of gold to whomever makes the best clothes.

01:00.109 --> 01:02.849
Really? What a good opportunity!

01:03.960 --> 01:05.577
Who will get the chance?

01:06.603 --> 01:09.501
The swindlers heard what the people said.

01:10.545 --> 01:12.122
Shall we try?

01:13.200 --> 01:18.285
Sure! There is no reason to refuse a lot of gold.

01:19.430 --> 01:22.937
The two swindlers visited the Emperor the next day.

01:24.055 --> 01:27.137
They introduced themselves as great weavers.
