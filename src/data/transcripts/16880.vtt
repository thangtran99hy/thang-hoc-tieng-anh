Once upon a time in London, there was a lovely girl named Wendy.

00:06.992 --> 00:10.926
She was reading stories to her brothers, John and Michael.

00:12.427 --> 00:17.829
"A long long time ago, there lived Peter Pan in Neverland."

00:19.262 --> 00:22.193
Wendy and her brothers liked the story.

00:23.681 --> 00:27.836
Suddenly Wendy's dog, Nana, barked out the window.

00:29.321 --> 00:32.019
There was a boy dressed in green.

00:34.297 --> 00:36.023
"Who are you?"

00:37.462 --> 00:42.289
"My name is Peter Pan and this is my special friend, Tinkerbell."

00:44.645 --> 00:47.304
"Hello! Nice to meet you!"

00:48.777 --> 00:53.907
Peter Pan and Tinkerbell flew around the room showing off tricks.

00:55.368 --> 00:56.883
"Wow, great!"

00:58.391 --> 01:00.963
"Are you really Peter Pan?"

01:02.523 --> 01:07.665
"Yes, I'm from Neverland. It's the island of dreams."

01:09.213 --> 01:14.649
"Wow, you are a real boy! That's amazing!"

01:16.207 --> 01:20.004
"I have always dreamed of Neverland."

01:21.421 --> 01:23.598
"Do you want to come to Neverland?"

01:25.192 --> 01:31.824
"Yes! But what about Michael and John? I want to go with them."

01:33.440 --> 01:35.504
"Of course they can come."

01:37.082 --> 01:39.532
"Yeah! Let's go!"

01:41.048 --> 01:46.579
Tinkerbell sprinkled magic dust on the children, and they began to fly.

01:48.174 --> 01:49.896
"Wow, fantastic!"

01:51.337 --> 01:53.214
"Whee!"

01:54.598 --> 01:55.909
They all shouted.

01:57.347 --> 02:02.530
Wendy, Michael and John flew to Neverland with Peter Pan.
