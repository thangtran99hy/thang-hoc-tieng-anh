00:00.012 --> 00:04.817
A long time ago, there lived a king and a queen in a palace.

00:05.960 --> 00:08.623
They had everything except a baby.

00:09.651 --> 00:13.861
"I really want a baby", said the queen.

00:14.951 --> 00:18.132
So do I. Let's hope we have one soon.

00:19.207 --> 00:23.889
Many years went by and finally they had a pretty princess.

00:24.995 --> 00:26.148
How great!

00:26.510 --> 00:30.185
She is as beautiful as the morning sunlight.

00:31.266 --> 00:36.805
Oh! I want to call her Aurora since she was born at dawn.

00:37.784 --> 00:39.389
That's wonderful!

00:40.377 --> 00:43.160
I'll hold a big christening for her.

00:44.199 --> 00:49.635
The king decided to invite all the fairies so they could give her good wishes.

00:50.686 --> 01:00.742
"Messenger, write invitations to the sky fairy, the flower fairy, the tree fairy and the water fairy", said the king.

01:01.749 --> 01:03.169
Is that all, my lord?

01:04.571 --> 01:15.297
Wait! Include the mountain fairy, the field fairy, the sunshine fairy and the moonlight fairy.

01:17.258 --> 01:18.611
I think that's all.

01:19.695 --> 01:22.896
Okay, my lord. I'll send letters to them right away.

01:23.903 --> 01:28.106
But they forgot to invite the bad weather fairy, Zelda.

01:29.059 --> 01:32.098
Zelda was an old and grumpy fairy.

01:34.601 --> 01:39.878
"Why didn't they invite me?", said Zelda to herself.

01:40.846 --> 01:44.359
She heard about the christening and came to the palace.

01:45.380 --> 01:48.882
After the christening, everyone sat down for dinner.

01:50.093 --> 01:52.635
Oh dear, here comes Zelda.

01:53.103 --> 01:55.017
We forgot to invite her.

01:55.969 --> 01:57.641
I'm very sorry.

01:57.808 --> 02:00.703
Please sit down and have dinner with us.

02:01.661 --> 02:04.980
Bring another chair and bring her a cup and a plate.
