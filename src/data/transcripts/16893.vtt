00:00.406 --> 00:02.651
There was a dog named Patrasche.

00:04.009 --> 00:07.274
His master was a cruel and evil man.

00:09.822 --> 00:15.844
"Pull the cart! I don't care whether you are tired or not! You are a useless dog!"

00:17.401 --> 00:20.666
He kicked Patrasche and threw him to the roadside.

00:22.165 --> 00:26.447
After a few days, an old man and a boy walked by.

00:27.921 --> 00:31.703
"Look at that poor dog! He looks dead."

00:33.039 --> 00:35.066
The boy ran to the dog.

00:37.395 --> 00:40.616
"He's still alive! Let's take him home."

00:42.065 --> 00:45.513
The old man, Jehan, felt pity for the dog.

00:46.853 --> 00:49.621
He couldn't say 'no' to his grandson.

00:51.022 --> 00:56.927
Jehan and Nello were very poor but lived happily near the city of Antwerp.

00:58.247 --> 01:02.331
Jehan took milk from the villagers and sold it in town.

01:03.777 --> 01:05.790
Patrasche was soon well again.

01:07.324 --> 01:10.267
One morning, Patrasche stood in front of the cart.

01:13.384 --> 01:16.981
"No, Patrasche, you don't have to do that."

01:18.385 --> 01:22.163
"Okay. If you really want to pull the cart, you can."

01:23.609 --> 01:27.346
One day, Jehan was too sick to go to Antwerp.

01:28.799 --> 01:33.384
"It's okay, grandfather. Patrasche and I can take the milk to town."

01:34.898 --> 01:35.905
"Are you sure?"

01:37.338 --> 01:41.724
"Yes, grandfather. Don't worry. You just rest at home."

01:43.051 --> 01:47.079
After that, Nello and Patrasche took milk to town.

01:48.356 --> 01:52.370
Nello went into a big church whenever they went to Antwerp.

01:53.770 --> 01:56.645
Patrasche wondered what Nello did in the church.

01:58.047 --> 02:00.257
He tried to come in to the church.

02:01.628 --> 02:05.383
"No, dirty dog! Dogs can't enter the church."

02:06.786 --> 02:10.709
Patrasche walked into the church when the guard wasn't looking.

02:11.982 --> 02:14.816
Patrasche saw Nello staring at a painting.

02:16.286 --> 02:20.642
There were three paintings by Rubens but two were covered by curtains.

02:22.063 --> 02:27.988
"Patrasche, we have to pay money to see those two. Someday I'll see them."
