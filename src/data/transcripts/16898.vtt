00:00.551 --> 00:03.217
There lived a girl named Sara in India.

00:04.304 --> 00:06.882
Her father decided to send her to London.

00:08.041 --> 00:10.481
Why do I have to live in London?

00:11.617 --> 00:15.236
Because India is too hot for you, Sara.

00:16.353 --> 00:21.082
Sara's father had a lot of money but had no other relatives.

00:22.321 --> 00:25.817
So he sent her to Miss Minchin's school for girls.

00:26.985 --> 00:30.351
Miss Minchin was an old, mean looking woman.

00:31.467 --> 00:35.127
"Oh! You will be the best student,"...

00:36.248 --> 00:37.489
...said Miss Minchin.

00:38.621 --> 00:41.853
For the first year, Sara was the best student.

00:42.997 --> 00:45.417
She was smart and very clever.

00:46.575 --> 00:50.742
But after the year, a letter came bringing very bad news.

00:51.939 --> 00:57.160
Sara's father had died, leaving Sara with no one to take care of her!.

00:58.251 --> 00:59.295
"Oh, no!"...

01:00.421 --> 01:01.746
...exclaimed Sara.

01:02.823 --> 01:04.775
What shall I do?

01:05.919 --> 01:09.574
"You owe a lot of money to our school,"...

01:10.678 --> 01:11.936
...said Miss Minchin.

01:13.147 --> 01:17.217
Stay here and work hard until you pay your debt.

01:18.535 --> 01:21.853
You will have to sleep in the attic, however.

01:22.984 --> 01:25.977
Sara started to live in the attic with Becky.

01:27.187 --> 01:31.927
Becky was a very kind and good-natured girl who worked at the school.

01:33.018 --> 01:35.447
Sara's life became very hard.

01:36.591 --> 01:41.353
Every day, she had to run errands and every night, she had to study.

01:42.537 --> 01:45.075
"I wish I were a princess,"...

01:46.152 --> 01:47.223
...said Sara.

01:48.393 --> 01:52.601
Don't be sad, Sara. It's not as miserable as you think.

01:53.963 --> 01:58.143
They say that after a heavy rain, the skies are clear.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.839
Becky comforted Sara.
