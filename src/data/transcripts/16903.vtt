00:00.343 --> 00:07.286
Once upon a time, there was a stingy man whose name was Ebenezer Scrooge.

00:08.820 --> 00:11.314
No people in the town liked him.

00:12.819 --> 00:16.288
Even beggars never asked him for anything.

00:17.903 --> 00:20.523
But, he didn't care at all.

00:22.061 --> 00:28.356
One Christmas Eve, he was working late in his office with his assistant, Bob.

00:30.110 --> 00:36.433
It was a very cold day but they had only a small fire to save money.

00:37.794 --> 00:39.065
It's so cold.

00:40.617 --> 00:44.890
At that moment, Scrooge's nephew came into the store.

00:46.491 --> 00:48.149
Merry Christmas, Uncle!

00:49.644 --> 00:52.853
Why are you so merry?   You're poor.

00:54.471 --> 00:58.161
Then why are you so miserable? You're rich.

00:59.487 --> 01:00.467
Bah! Humbug!

01:01.953 --> 01:05.931
Uncle, please come to dinner tomorrow for Christmas.

01:07.453 --> 01:08.339
No, I'm busy.

01:09.668 --> 01:10.585
Are you sure?

01:11.906 --> 01:14.791
I said no. Don't bother me and go away!

01:16.225 --> 01:19.344
Well, have a Merry Christmas anyway, Uncle.

01:20.809 --> 01:25.945
His nephew also wished Bob a Merry Christmas and left.

01:27.429 --> 01:30.665
I suppose you want to have tomorrow off, Bob?

01:31.815 --> 01:32.852
Yes, please.

01:34.244 --> 01:38.115
Okay, but you'll have to come in extra early the next day then.

01:39.464 --> 01:42.493
Oh, sure. Thank you. Have a Merry Christmas, sir.

01:43.792 --> 01:48.624
Bob ran home to be with his family on Christmas Eve.

01:49.925 --> 01:55.880
Scrooge had a lonely dinner at an old restaurant that night and went home.

01:57.296 --> 02:02.903
As he was opening the door, the knocker changed into a ghostly face.

02:04.309 --> 02:08.993
It was the face of his dead business partner, Jacob Marley.

02:10.313 --> 02:13.636
He shook his head and walked into the house.

02:15.047 --> 02:21.821
He looked all through his house and saw no ghosts, so he sat down by the fire.

02:23.003 --> 02:27.063
This is strange, but I don't believe in ghosts.

02:28.361 --> 02:35.041
Just then, he heard strange noises and rattling chains coming up the stairs.

02:36.349 --> 02:40.729
Scrooge! Scrooge! Scrooge!

02:42.060 --> 02:46.461
A ghost walked through a wall and came towards him.

02:47.767 --> 02:48.872
Who is it?

02:50.269 --> 02:52.981
I was your partner, Jacob Marley.

02:54.230 --> 02:56.091
What do you want from me?

02:57.391 --> 03:01.927
I want to tell you that you still have a chance to live a happy life.
