Thomas Alva Edison was born in 1847 in Milan, Ohio, U.S.A.

00:06.809 --> 00:10.061
His father was of Dutch blood and his mother of Scotch.

00:11.193 --> 00:14.229
He liked to ask questions about everything he encountered.

00:15.330 --> 00:19.979
When Edison was in his childhood, he saw a man who was making a boat in the forest.

00:21.126 --> 00:23.738
How can the boat float on the water, sir?

00:24.837 --> 00:26.891
What? Why do you want to know that?

00:28.017 --> 00:29.620
I am just wondering.

00:30.725 --> 00:32.990
You don't need to know that. Go away!

00:34.083 --> 00:37.999
He saw a beehive when he was still thinking about the boat in the forest.

00:39.110 --> 00:42.166
Huh? What's that? What's in there?

00:43.303 --> 00:46.578
He touched the beehive lightly, wondering at its shape.

00:47.665 --> 00:49.078
Ah!

00:50.232 --> 00:52.737
A hive of bees rushed at him suddenly.

00:53.909 --> 00:57.843
One day, his mother called him for dinner, but he didn't answer.

00:58.945 --> 01:01.994
Where are you, Alva? It's time for dinner!

01:03.092 --> 01:04.829
Maybe he is at the barn.

01:06.031 --> 01:08.747
He spends most of his time staying there these days.

01:09.859 --> 01:11.503
They went to the barn together.

01:12.619 --> 01:15.778
Alva! Alva! Are you there?

01:16.905 --> 01:21.562
Shh! Please be quiet! You shouldn't make any noise, dad!

01:22.653 --> 01:24.259
What are you doing here?

01:25.354 --> 01:28.503
I'm brooding eggs to make them hatch.

01:29.610 --> 01:33.380
His mother set her mind at ease and admonished him kindly.

01:34.768 --> 01:36.845
They won't become chicks with that.

01:37.936 --> 01:39.577
Get up and come for dinner.

01:40.763 --> 01:44.866
But, dad told me that if I keep them warm, they will be hatched.

01:45.986 --> 01:48.743
That doesn't mean that you can sit on them, Alva!

01:49.973 --> 01:55.466
Several years later, Alva entered elementary school and his parents worried about him.

01:56.597 --> 02:00.199
Because, he still had a barrage of questions about everything.

02:01.319 --> 02:03.437
One day, he was in a math class.

02:04.569 --> 02:06.917
One plus one is two.

02:08.075 --> 02:10.944
Teacher, can you explain to me why?

02:12.050 --> 02:14.965
You can just count them. Those are two!

02:16.056 --> 02:18.423
Then, why can't it be three?

02:19.495 --> 02:22.993
What? It's a rule. Just memorize it.
