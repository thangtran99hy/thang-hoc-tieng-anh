00:00.086 --> 00:03.501
There was once an orphan boy who lived with his aunt.

00:04.647 --> 00:07.839
Tom Sawyer, did you take more jam from the jar?

00:08.913 --> 00:11.443
No, Aunt Polly. Honestly, I didn't.

00:12.569 --> 00:15.817
Tom jumped over the fence and ran away to play.

00:16.933 --> 00:20.916
He's such a wild boy, but I don't have the heart to spank him.

00:22.004 --> 00:28.541
That Saturday was a beautiful day and Tom was on his way to the river for a swim.

00:29.643 --> 00:33.175
Tom, you have to paint the garden fence this morning.

00:34.247 --> 00:37.251
Aunt, I can't! I have to go swimming.

00:38.373 --> 00:41.952
I'm sorry, Tom. But painting the fence is your duty.

00:42.799 --> 00:44.469
You can go swimming later.

00:45.547 --> 00:49.336
With a heavy heart, Tom began to paint the fence.

00:50.407 --> 00:52.508
His task seemed endless.

00:53.539 --> 00:56.831
Ugh! Can I finish this work today?

00:57.995 --> 01:02.732
Soon, some of the boys in the neighborhood saw Tom painting the fence.

01:03.790 --> 01:10.136
He suddenly began to paint with renewed vigor and he looked as if he was having a great time.

01:11.249 --> 01:14.335
Can I help you, Tom? It looks like fun.

01:15.267 --> 01:16.819
Let me just try a little.

01:17.622 --> 01:20.553
If you give me a chance, I'll give you my apples.

01:21.501 --> 01:23.906
Sure, if you really want to.

01:24.943 --> 01:30.265
Tom gave up the paintbrush with dread in his face, but joy in his heart.

01:31.313 --> 01:33.790
His pockets were full of new things.

01:34.903 --> 01:39.962
Then, he enjoyed his idle time in the shade while the fence was being finished.

01:40.957 --> 01:43.177
I'm going swimming now, Aunt Polly!

01:44.240 --> 01:48.051
What? Did you finish your work? That's impossible.

01:49.047 --> 01:52.279
When she looked at the fence, she was amazed.

01:53.181 --> 01:55.015
See you later, Aunt Polly.

01:56.078 --> 02:01.581
The next morning, Tom ran to Huckleberry Finn who was his best friend.

02:02.374 --> 02:06.388
Huck was also an orphan and lived alone near the woods.

02:07.227 --> 02:12.319
Tom always envied him because Huck didn't go to school or study.

02:13.119 --> 02:17.320
When Tom visited Huck, he was relaxing under a tree.

02:18.197 --> 02:19.829
What are you doing here, Huck?

02:21.053 --> 02:24.430
I'm thinking about the treasure in the haunted house.

02:25.585 --> 02:30.775
I'm going to go there to find the pirate's treasure tonight. Will you join me?

02:31.815 --> 02:34.305
Really? It'll be very exciting!

02:35.373 --> 02:38.596
Maybe, we can also see a ghost.

02:39.543 --> 02:41.974
Definitely, I'll go there with you.

02:43.253 --> 02:48.705
That night, Tom snuck out of his room to meet Huck at the haunted house.

02:49.701 --> 02:53.259
It's awfully quiet and gloomy around here.

02:54.176 --> 02:56.174
I'm very scared, Huck.

02:57.111 --> 03:02.397
Me too, Tom, but I'm having fun as well. Let's go inside.

03:03.515 --> 03:05.329
Okay, you go first.
