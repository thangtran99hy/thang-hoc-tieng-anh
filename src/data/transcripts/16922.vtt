00:00.681 --> 00:04.899
Once upon a time, there were two noble families in the town of Verona.

00:05.940 --> 00:08.371
They were the Capulets and the Montagues.

00:09.429 --> 00:12.439
Unfortunately, there was a great feud between them.

00:13.498 --> 00:16.355
Lord Capulet had a beautiful daughter, Juliet.

00:17.484 --> 00:20.762
Let's have a party for our lovely daughter.

00:21.813 --> 00:23.441
That's a great idea.

00:24.498 --> 00:26.641
They decided to have a grand party.

00:27.777 --> 00:32.927
On the night of the party, most people in the town were invited except for the Montagues.

00:34.053 --> 00:38.472
However, a Montague named Romeo snuck into the party with his friend.

00:39.725 --> 00:41.953
What a beautiful lady she is!

00:42.558 --> 00:44.680
I think I'm falling in love.

00:45.761 --> 00:51.177
At that moment, Juliet's cousin, Tybalt saw Romeo and told on Lord Capulet.

00:52.235 --> 00:54.854
Please kick those Montagues out of here.

00:56.007 --> 00:57.978
This is a party, Tybalt.

00:58.364 --> 01:01.047
Don't fight and just have fun.

01:02.147 --> 01:04.709
But Tybalt wanted to fight the Montagues.

01:05.769 --> 01:08.610
Would you like to dance with me, beautiful lady?

01:09.626 --> 01:10.389
Okay.

01:11.453 --> 01:13.625
They fell in love while they were dancing.

01:14.695 --> 01:17.642
The party finished and Romeo left with his friend.

01:18.743 --> 01:22.403
I can't believe I've fallen in love with my enemy!

01:23.503 --> 01:26.724
At that time, Juliet was standing at her window.

01:27.779 --> 01:31.173
The man I love is a Montague? Oh, no!

01:32.219 --> 01:34.261
Come on, Romeo. We have to leave now.

01:35.353 --> 01:36.576
I must go back.

01:37.002 --> 01:38.695
I have something to tell her.

01:39.777 --> 01:41.982
Romeo snuck into the house again.

01:43.057 --> 01:46.211
He hid himself in the shadows on Juliet's balcony.

01:47.236 --> 01:49.303
She was still standing at her window.

01:50.519 --> 01:53.634
Oh, Romeo! Why are you Romeo?

01:54.063 --> 01:55.369
What is in the name?

01:56.639 --> 02:00.431
If a rose had a different name, it would still smell sweet.

02:01.746 --> 02:04.473
Give up your name and take me instead.

02:05.695 --> 02:07.367
"Then call me 'love',..."

02:08.407 --> 02:10.453
...Romeo suddenly stood and said.

02:11.463 --> 02:12.476
How did you...?

02:13.883 --> 02:16.662
Romeo just smiled and opened his arms.
