Once upon a time, Edward was born the son of the King of Wales.

00:06.317 --> 00:11.048
My son, Prince Edward, will be the King of Wales.

00:12.307 --> 00:17.094
On the same day, Tom was born the son of the beggar Canty.

00:18.256 --> 00:22.020
Oh no, another baby who wants food! Stop crying!

00:23.137 --> 00:26.317
Prince Edward grew up with a good background.

00:27.462 --> 00:29.748
How was school, my son?

00:30.959 --> 00:36.536
Tom had to beg for the money every day, but he liked to read books.

00:37.687 --> 00:39.047
What are you doing here?

00:40.197 --> 00:42.436
Get more money or I'll beat you.

00:44.027 --> 00:52.126
One day, while Tom was begging around the town, he saw a magnificent building in the strange area.

00:53.300 --> 00:56.107
Wow! How beautiful!

00:57.219 --> 00:59.565
Hey you! Get away from the king's gate!

01:00.683 --> 01:03.123
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

01:04.261 --> 01:08.776
When the guard tried to kick Tom out of the gate, Edward saw them.

01:10.026 --> 01:14.637
Guard, let go of him now! How dare you treat someone like that?

01:15.705 --> 01:17.067
Thank you, sir.

01:18.313 --> 01:22.878
You look so hungry. Come with me into the castle for some food.

01:23.994 --> 01:27.688
They ate and talked for a long time in the castle.

01:28.920 --> 01:31.252
Everything is so complicated here.

01:32.623 --> 01:34.856
What's happening outside the castle?

01:36.225 --> 01:37.939
I want to get out of here.

01:39.045 --> 01:43.283
I only wish I could have clothes as nice as yours.

01:44.527 --> 01:48.609
Um, how about trading clothes with each other?

01:49.808 --> 01:54.346
Wow, I can't believe it! You look just like me!

01:55.423 --> 01:56.920
It's amazing.

01:58.017 --> 01:59.932
We're the same size!

02:01.013 --> 02:02.956
Our hair is even the same.

02:04.091 --> 02:08.095
I'll test the guard. It'll be interesting, won't it?

02:09.237 --> 02:11.585
Soon, Edward went to the guard.

02:12.665 --> 02:14.925
The guard thought he was the beggar.

02:16.118 --> 02:19.924
You filthy beggar! What are you doing in the castle? Get out of here!

02:21.029 --> 02:25.432
Get your hands off me. I am your master, the Prince of Wales.

02:26.661 --> 02:31.013
The guard didn't listen to Edward and kicked him out of the castle.

02:32.104 --> 02:35.368
Huh? I just intended it as a joke.

02:36.470 --> 02:40.253
Edward just walked along the street for a long time.

02:41.398 --> 02:44.654
Where should I go? I don't know where I am.
