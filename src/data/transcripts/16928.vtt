00:00.831 --> 00:08.041
Mary Lennox grew up in India, but she had to move to England to live with her uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven,...

00:08.447 --> 00:10.155
...because her parents both died.

00:11.369 --> 00:18.268
She would live with Mr. Craven until she was 18 years old because he was the only relative she had.

00:19.463 --> 00:24.999
Mrs. Medlock, a housekeeper, waited for Mary when Mary arrived at the station.

00:26.124 --> 00:27.116
Are you Mary?

00:27.471 --> 00:28.520
Nice to meet you.

00:28.870 --> 00:31.389
I'm Mrs. Medlock from Mr. Craven's.

00:32.474 --> 00:33.651
Where is my uncle?

00:34.134 --> 00:35.804
I've never seen him before.

00:36.925 --> 00:38.347
He's so busy working.

00:38.845 --> 00:39.865
Anyway, follow me.

00:40.975 --> 00:42.991
We have to hurry to catch the train.

00:44.100 --> 00:49.353
On the train to Mr. Craven's house, Mary watched the beautiful English countryside.

00:50.487 --> 00:55.667
Wow! I've never seen such a beautiful countryside before.

00:56.856 --> 00:58.759
It's so different from India.

00:59.484 --> 01:00.837
Where are we going now?

01:01.985 --> 01:03.863
We're going to Misselthwaite Manor.

01:04.183 --> 01:06.075
That will be your new home.

01:07.229 --> 01:10.675
Wow! How big this castle is!

01:11.793 --> 01:14.723
This castle belongs to the Craven Family.

01:16.193 --> 01:19.075
It has a very big lake and many gardens.

01:20.372 --> 01:21.593
This is your room.

01:21.972 --> 01:24.059
Don't ever hang around the house,...

01:25.517 --> 01:28.860
...but you are allowed to play in the gardens outside.

01:30.119 --> 01:34.631
As Medlock left Mary alone in the room, Mary felt more lonely.

01:35.909 --> 01:38.839
Good morning, Mary. I'm Martha, the maid.

01:39.262 --> 01:41.048
Have breakfast and go outside.

01:42.405 --> 01:45.527
Remember not to go into the garden, which is locked up.

01:46.594 --> 01:47.830
Why is it locked?

01:49.041 --> 01:54.055
Well, that's where Mrs. Craven died in an accident 10 years ago.

01:55.285 --> 02:00.667
After that, Mr. Craven locked the gate of the garden and buried the key.

02:01.711 --> 02:04.121
Mary liked the idea of a secret garden.

02:05.152 --> 02:07.629
She saw tall trees surrounding the garden.

02:08.741 --> 02:10.175
They're so beautiful.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.319
Look at the robin singing.

02:13.406 --> 02:15.937
Then, she found a wall of green ivy.

02:17.042 --> 02:19.860
There must be the secret garden beyond the wall.

02:21.081 --> 02:22.975
I wish I could see inside.

02:24.093 --> 02:28.139
That night, she couldn't sleep because of thinking about the secret garden.

02:29.223 --> 02:32.683
Then, she heard a strange sound was coming from another room.

02:34.839 --> 02:39.035
Martha! Martha! Is that someone crying?

02:40.181 --> 02:42.301
No, it's just the wind.

02:42.765 --> 02:43.772
Go to sleep.

02:44.868 --> 02:47.853
Mary always had breakfast, then went out to the garden.

02:48.867 --> 02:53.953
She heard the sound of a boy crying at night from time to time, but she tried not to care about it.

02:55.055 --> 02:58.563
One day, she saw the exact same robin again in the garden.

02:59.659 --> 03:02.822
It didn't fly away, but sat on a ring in the ground.
