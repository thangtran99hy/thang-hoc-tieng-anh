00:00.592 --> 00:02.957
There lived a girl named Alice.

00:04.021 --> 00:06.547
She had an elder sister, Mary.

00:07.660 --> 00:10.460
One day, they were sitting by the river.

00:11.637 --> 00:16.493
Her sister was reading a book with big words and no pictures.

00:17.901 --> 00:23.045
The sun is nice and warm, but I'm so bored.

00:24.317 --> 00:26.352
Why don't you take a nap?

00:27.556 --> 00:30.670
Um... That's a good idea!

00:32.074 --> 00:37.552
Alice saw a white rabbit running past when she was about to fall asleep.

00:38.812 --> 00:42.410
The rabbit pulled a watch from his coat pocket and said,...

00:43.651 --> 00:47.343
"...I'm too late! I have a very important date."

00:48.452 --> 00:51.027
Huh? How strange!

00:52.193 --> 00:56.238
She watched as the rabbit ran into a strange hole.

00:57.449 --> 00:59.632
I wonder where he's going.

01:00.892 --> 01:02.573
I want to follow him.

01:03.684 --> 01:05.923
Alice crawled into the hole.

01:07.034 --> 01:09.404
Soon, she was falling and falling.

01:10.496 --> 01:13.236
She landed safely and looked around.

01:14.496 --> 01:18.317
After a while, she found a small door in the hall.

01:19.410 --> 01:21.965
She looked outside through the keyhole.

01:23.336 --> 01:27.455
Oh, what a beautiful garden!

01:28.920 --> 01:31.263
I wish I could go there.

01:32.485 --> 01:36.623
Alice was far too big to fit through the small door.

01:37.921 --> 01:43.945
Then, she saw a glass bottle labeled 'Drink Me' and a key on the table.

01:45.223 --> 01:46.532
What are they?

01:47.717 --> 01:52.067
She saw no sign that read 'Poison' so she drank the bottle.

01:53.476 --> 01:58.061
Oh, what's happening? I'm shrinking!

01:59.381 --> 02:03.519
Soon, she became small enough to fit through the door.

02:04.731 --> 02:08.627
Oops.... I forgot to take the key!

02:09.700 --> 02:14.390
She tried to climb the table leg but she was too small to reach it.

02:15.591 --> 02:17.627
Huh? What's this?

02:18.962 --> 02:22.772
There was a small box labeled 'Eat Me' under the table.

02:24.032 --> 02:27.109
Alice opened it and found a small cake.

02:28.381 --> 02:33.320
If it makes me bigger, maybe I can get the key.

02:34.524 --> 02:36.707
Alice quickly ate the cake.

02:37.883 --> 02:41.797
Then she grew so big, her head hit the ceiling.

02:42.927 --> 02:46.897
Now I can't fit through the door!

02:48.027 --> 02:50.006
She cried and cried.
