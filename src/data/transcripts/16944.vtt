Hi! My name is Lucas and I like to fly hang gliders.

00:08.356 --> 00:09.835
Because that's what inspires me.

00:10.458 --> 00:13.788
It's like the sky is my canvas and there's no lines to color between.

00:14.293 --> 00:16.367
You're free to travel wherever the air can take you.

00:17.230 --> 00:20.285
I use invisible masses of rising air to go up,...

00:20.889 --> 00:23.899
...and then glide very long distances.

00:25.623 --> 00:29.830
And I like to share this inspiration through creating videos and maybe inspire others.

00:30.127 --> 00:31.719
My computer is pretty important for that.

00:32.307 --> 00:36.075
And it allows me to do special effects, which is why I like superhero movies.

00:36.346 --> 00:38.745
But I'm not defined only by my actions,...

00:38.969 --> 00:43.527
...whether it's hang gliding, running, creating videos,...

00:44.693 --> 00:47.530
...or even climbing three of the world's seven summits,...

00:51.413 --> 00:55.391
...but also by my thoughts, beliefs, and most importantly, friends and family;...

00:55.674 --> 00:57.931
...especially the one my wife and I just started together.

00:58.415 --> 00:59.630
We have two awesome dogs.

01:00.877 --> 01:01.889
Life is an adventure.

01:02.337 --> 01:02.767
I love it.
