An organization's business model can be described with nine basic building blocks:...

00:10.364 --> 00:13.665
...your customer segments, your value proposition for each segment,...

00:14.020 --> 00:19.345
...the channels to each customers, customer relationships you establish,...

00:19.781 --> 00:25.399
...the revenue streams you generate, the key resources and key activities you require to create value,...

00:26.665 --> 00:29.901
...the key partners and the cost structure of the business model.

00:31.151 --> 00:34.257
But it's not sufficient to just enumerate the nine building blocks.

00:34.699 --> 00:38.372
What you really want to do is to map them out on a prestructured canvas.

00:42.067 --> 00:46.595
This is what we call the Business Model Canvas: the tool that helps you map, discuss,...

00:46.675 --> 00:49.001
...design and invent new business models.

00:50.331 --> 00:54.249
Let's briefly go through the nine building blocks starting with the customer segments.

00:54.562 --> 00:57.609
These are all the people or organizations for which you're creating value.

00:58.305 --> 01:00.764
This includes simple users and paying customers.

01:02.383 --> 01:05.247
For each segment you have a specific value proposition,...

01:05.494 --> 01:08.927
...these are the bundles of products and services that create value for your customers.

01:09.479 --> 01:11.315
The channels describe through which touchpoints...

01:11.409 --> 01:13.556
...you're interacting with customers and delivering value.

01:20.414 --> 01:24.502
Customer relationships outline the type of relationship you're establishing with your customers.

01:27.261 --> 01:30.653
The revenue streams make clear how and through which pricing mechanisms...

01:30.727 --> 01:32.451
...your business model is capturing value.

01:33.844 --> 01:38.567
Then, you need to describe the infrastructure to create, deliver and capture value.

01:38.746 --> 01:42.367
The key resources show which assets are indispensable in your business model.

01:44.010 --> 01:47.651
The key activities show which things you really need to be able to perform well.

01:48.754 --> 01:51.685
The key partners show who can help you leverage your business model...

01:52.032 --> 01:56.804
...since you won't earn all key resources yourself nor you perform all key activities.

01:57.035 --> 01:59.885
Then, once you understand your business model's infrastructure...

02:00.263 --> 02:02.354
...you'll also have an idea of its cost structure.

02:03.350 --> 02:08.089
So with the Business Model Canvas, you can map out your entire business model in one image.

02:08.801 --> 02:12.913
This works for start-up entrepreneurs, just as well as for the most senior executives.
