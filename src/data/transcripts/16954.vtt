Hi, I'm Aimee Mullins.

00:01.724 --> 00:05.517
I'm the new brand ambassador for L'Oreal Paris.

00:06.124 --> 00:10.806
Things that I'm celebrated for whether it's from sports or you know, fashion...

00:10.948 --> 00:19.044
...having been, in spite of, even because of, what I've learned and have experienced...

00:19.216 --> 00:21.183
... as a woman living with two prosthetic legs.

00:23.895 --> 00:29.965
We don't need to fit in to someone else's idea of what beauty is.

00:30.215 --> 00:35.966
Decide for yourself and invent the version of yourself that you want to see on that day.

00:36.380 --> 00:40.131
And for me, it's like it's in a very literal way, could be changing my height.

00:41.597 --> 00:45.102
Changing the kinds of legs I wear actually changes the way I feel.

00:48.433 --> 00:51.630
The slogan of "Because you're worth it."...

00:51.770 --> 00:58.591
...had a resonance that connected women to something bigger than themselves.

00:58.811 --> 01:02.610
For me anyway, it provoked something totally unexpected,...

01:03.127 --> 01:05.763
...which was giving myself the pat on the back.

01:05.958 --> 01:10.115
Being my own cheerleader I'd say, "Yes, you are enough!"

01:13.126 --> 01:15.649
When I filmed my first commercial, it was a great experience.

01:16.102 --> 01:20.625
For a lot of it, it was just, I was actually taking my voice down to a whisper.

01:21.435 --> 01:25.887
We wanted to create this mood of intimacy like I was revealing something.

01:26.544 --> 01:29.481
For me "Because I'm worth it.", it's an incredibly personal thing.

01:29.781 --> 01:34.441
There were different emotions that were provoked,...

01:34.834 --> 01:37.967
...realizing like wow, that actually was hard to say that time.

01:38.595 --> 01:42.687
That actually almost made me cry or well, that was interesting.

01:42.763 --> 01:45.705
There was some kind of defiance that came out when you said it at that time.

01:46.607 --> 01:50.040
What happened there, that it can mean something very personal is...

01:50.193 --> 01:58.413
...I think what makes this tagline and the signature for L'Oreal Paris so iconic.
