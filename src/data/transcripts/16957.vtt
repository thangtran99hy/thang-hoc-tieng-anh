00:05.473 --> 00:08.480
Want to get yourself out of a bad situation and into a better one?

00:09.033 --> 00:10.938
A solid resume is the first step.

00:11.700 --> 00:14.280
You will need a computer and a printer.

00:14.928 --> 00:18.097
Step one: Write your name in bold at the top of the page,...

00:18.203 --> 00:21.163
...followed by your address, phone numbers and email address. 

00:21.479 --> 00:22.619
Then center the whole thing.

00:23.438 --> 00:26.805
It also helps to make your heading slightly bigger than the rest of your resume...

00:27.416 --> 00:29.196
...so it stands out at the top of the page.

00:29.699 --> 00:33.675
Step two: List your work history, starting with your most recent position.

00:34.025 --> 00:35.387
Include the place of employment,...

00:35.958 --> 00:39.026
...the dates you were employed there and the type of job you performed.

00:40.755 --> 00:43.893
If it's your job titles that are impressive, lead with them in bold.

00:44.495 --> 00:48.983
If the places you worked are more impressive than what you actually did there, bold them instead.

00:49.457 --> 00:52.819
Step three: Give a brief summary of what you did at each position.

00:53.373 --> 00:56.917
Step four: Look closely at the description of the job you're applying for...

00:57.054 --> 01:00.955
...and adjust what you've written to emphasize your most relevant skills and experience.

01:01.915 --> 01:05.472
If you're not applying for a specific job, use an "Objective" line...

01:05.589 --> 01:08.583
...to describe what kind of work you're looking for and why you want it.

01:09.047 --> 01:12.467
Step five: Leave at least three spaces between job summations...

01:12.533 --> 01:16.488
...so your resume is easy to read, even if that means shortening some sections.

01:18.055 --> 01:22.003
Step six: When you're done listing former jobs, list your education,...

01:22.156 --> 01:25.407
...including the school you graduated from and the degree you earned there.

01:25.892 --> 01:29.715
Step seven: After your education, list any personal information...

01:29.965 --> 01:33.167
...like hobbies, interests or skills that pertain to the job you're seeking.

01:33.508 --> 01:34.987
But leave out the stupid stuff.

01:35.304 --> 01:38.524
If you're applying for a job as a mortician, nobody cares if you can juggle.

01:39.362 --> 01:43.009
The most relevant skills to include are proficiency in a foreign language...

01:43.360 --> 01:45.988
...and knowledge of a specific computer application or platform.

01:47.011 --> 01:51.590
Step eight: Always offer to make references available upon request at the end of your resume.

01:51.956 --> 01:52.737
It's classy.

01:52.966 --> 01:54.969
And if you actually have them, it's even better.

01:56.959 --> 02:01.981
Step nine: Be sure to spell-check your work and ask a friend to look it over before you print it out.

02:02.479 --> 02:07.591
Step ten: When your resume is letter-perfect, print it out on the special paper of your choice.

02:08.576 --> 02:09.367
Did you know?

02:09.583 --> 02:13.883
On average, for every 200 resumes reviewed, only one interview is granted.
