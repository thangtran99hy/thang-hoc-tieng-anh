So our shared future and the unprecedented opportunity to meet...

00:14.364 --> 00:17.301
...shared challenges together is what brings me to Seoul.

00:18.494 --> 00:21.405
Over the next two days, under President Lee's leadership,...

00:21.717 --> 00:24.239
...more than 50 nations will mark our progress...

00:24.618 --> 00:27.995
...toward the goal we set at the summit I hosted two years ago in Washington,...

00:28.895 --> 00:32.386
...securing the world's vulnerable nuclear materials in four years...

00:32.903 --> 00:35.155
...so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists.

00:35.493 --> 00:39.357
The President then sat down for discussions with the Presidents of the Russian Federation,...

00:39.779 --> 00:42.065
...Kazakhstan and the People's Republic of China...

00:42.457 --> 00:46.445
...before marking the official beginning of the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.

00:47.576 --> 00:51.750

00:52.063 --> 00:54.033
...that the President convened in Washington DC.

00:54.367 --> 00:56.807
Meanwhile, back at home and halfway across the globe,...

00:57.168 --> 00:59.101

00:59.440 --> 01:03.697
...her week, in the 4th Annual Kitchen Garden Planting on the South Lawn of the White House,...

01:04.195 --> 01:08.761
...with help from students from North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Iowa...

01:09.305 --> 01:12.283
...and Girl Scout Troop 60325 from New York.

01:12.960 --> 01:15.882
Meanwhile back in Korea, the Summit was now in full swing...

01:16.098 --> 01:17.743
...with the first plenary session underway,...

01:18.141 --> 01:21.964
...and then a break for the so-called family photo with the leaders of the nations...

01:22.297 --> 01:24.117
...participating in the Nuclear Security Summit.

01:25.916 --> 01:28.817

01:36.119 --> 01:39.626

01:39.708 --> 01:42.625

01:43.127 --> 01:46.328

01:53.873 --> 01:56.315
On Thursday, the president spoke in the Rose Garden...

01:56.788 --> 01:59.826
...and called on congress to end the billions in taxpayer subsidies...

02:00.162 --> 02:02.213
...that goes to the largest oil and gas companies.

02:03.562 --> 02:08.265
They can either vote to spend billions of dollars more in oil subsidies...

02:08.343 --> 02:09.797
... that keep us trapped in the past,...

02:10.582 --> 02:16.399
...or they can vote to end these taxpayer subsidies that aren't needed to boost oil production...

02:16.963 --> 02:19.252
...so that we can invest in the future.

02:20.750 --> 02:21.415
It's that simple.

02:22.213 --> 02:24.963
And as long as I'm President, I'm betting on the future.

...who represent communities all across America.
