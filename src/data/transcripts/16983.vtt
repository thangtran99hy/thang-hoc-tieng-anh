00:00.613 --> 00:03.181
We built the entire library out of recycled bottles.

00:03.769 --> 00:05.098
Fried ants are delicious.

00:05.541 --> 00:07.703
We finished the clinic in a rainstorm.

00:08.245 --> 00:08.865
Really?

00:09.260 --> 00:10.377
That was a confidence builder.

00:10.515 --> 00:12.182
My students actually ended up teaching me.

00:13.059 --> 00:14.945
So I learned this dance. Let me show you this dance.

00:19.959 --> 00:22.813
The classroom was more of a class tent.

00:23.173 --> 00:27.045

00:27.568 --> 00:28.903
My alarm clock was a rooster.

00:29.173 --> 00:32.771
Beans for breakfast, beans for lunch, beans for dinner. We ate a lot of beans.

00:32.972 --> 00:34.190
I learned a third language.

00:34.686 --> 00:36.455
My seatmate on the bus was a goat.

00:36.638 --> 00:39.633
Always include the village elders. Always.

00:39.815 --> 00:41.319
My morning commute was by canoe.

00:41.475 --> 00:46.448
After two months I was ready to quit, but after two years I didn't want to leave.

00:46.879 --> 00:47.884
I didn't know I had it in me.

00:48.253 --> 00:51.171
Turn two years of service into a lifetime of experience.

00:51.407 --> 00:54.187
To all the Peace Corps volunteers: past, present and future,...
