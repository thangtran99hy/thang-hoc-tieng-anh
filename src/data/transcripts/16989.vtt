00:00.553 --> 00:02.063
Want to stand out from the crowd?

00:02.534 --> 00:04.328
Stick around and I'll tell you how.

00:04.605 --> 00:07.648
I'm Cat Miller and this is Dice TV.

00:15.325 --> 00:16.981
The competition for jobs is heating up.

00:17.375 --> 00:18.353
It's an economic thing.

00:19.042 --> 00:20.620
If you want employers to notice you,...

00:20.682 --> 00:24.124
...your resume has got to show them just how professional you are.

00:24.447 --> 00:27.380
One way to do that: be brief.

00:27.999 --> 00:30.802
Most HR departments are understaffed and overworked.

00:30.895 --> 00:33.629
One job posting can inundate them in just hours.

00:34.093 --> 00:36.677
So, what you say? "That's their job," you say?

00:36.825 --> 00:41.426
Well, consider this: most resumes get a whopping 10 to 30 seconds...

00:41.447 --> 00:44.010
...before they're moved up or thrown out.

00:44.160 --> 00:47.533
If yours is too long or too crowded, you can bet it's going to be rejected.

00:48.322 --> 00:52.139
Remember, the purpose of a resume is to get you the interview.

00:52.530 --> 00:55.667
So when you write it, follow these general guidelines.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.753
First remember, it's a resume.

00:58.976 --> 01:00.477
It's not an autobiography.

01:00.945 --> 01:03.463
Keep it focused on your work history and your skills.

01:03.688 --> 01:06.737
Do not mention race, religion, politics, or gender.

01:07.311 --> 01:09.569
And you might like to play the drums on weekends, but...

01:09.672 --> 01:11.337
...you know, employers don't need to know about it.

01:11.993 --> 01:15.905
Make sure that you have a powerful objective or headline and a strong summary.

01:16.271 --> 01:18.194
These are the first things an employer will see...

01:18.246 --> 01:20.852
...and your best-selling points need to be right at the top,...

01:21.401 --> 01:22.549
...below your name and address.

01:23.093 --> 01:25.379
Make sure the resume looks crisp and clean.

01:25.637 --> 01:29.157
Keep your type size to no more than 12 points but don't make it too small either,...

01:29.683 --> 01:30.625
...no less than 10.

01:31.114 --> 01:33.488
If you're struggling for space, look for some words to cut.

01:34.206 --> 01:38.967
Remember, you've got about 10 seconds.

01:39.376 --> 01:43.023
Your resume has to be well-designed, be easy to follow, be tight,...

01:43.467 --> 01:46.773
...and most important, demonstrate why you're the best candidate...

01:46.849 --> 01:48.608
...and should be called in for an interview.

01:50.599 --> 01:51.558
No pressure there.

01:52.401 --> 01:54.792
