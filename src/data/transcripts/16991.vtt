00:04.893 --> 00:06.002
I think first of all, it should be brief.

00:06.350 --> 00:11.176
Being succinct and direct about what you're looking for, what you can offer...

00:11.514 --> 00:13.696
...and why we should consider you for the opportunity.

00:13.791 --> 00:18.943
I want to know that the person can write, can compose.

00:19.317 --> 00:24.477
The other thing is it gives me a better idea about, "Do I want to read the resume?"

00:24.563 --> 00:29.920
The cover letter should tell me why you like our company, what you're looking for...

00:30.307 --> 00:32.334
...and how your skills translate to what we need.

00:32.869 --> 00:36.141
Explain why you're interested in that particular job, that's incredibly important.

00:36.548 --> 00:40.245
We want to make sure that you have actually looked into the position and into the company.

00:40.666 --> 00:43.346
And that there's something you're bringing to the job that no one else is.

00:43.614 --> 00:47.053
What I'm most interested is how can you contribute to the success of our company.

00:47.119 --> 00:51.228
So make sure that you articulate that in the letter, it's about what you can do.

00:51.411 --> 00:55.753
Show some enthusiasm or passion around why the position is right for you.

00:55.943 --> 01:01.353
It's a letter that is going to go into the "keep" stack as opposed to the "defer" stack.
