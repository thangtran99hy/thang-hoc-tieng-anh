"Writing the Perfect Cover Letter."

00:06.717 --> 00:08.144
There's a job you really want.

00:08.436 --> 00:11.235
Question is, how do you get one foot in the door?

00:11.551 --> 00:14.722
Well, the first step is to have an awesome cover letter.

00:15.133 --> 00:19.841
A cover letter is a great opportunity to tailor your qualifications to a job opening.

00:20.409 --> 00:22.859
Think of it as a summary of your resume.

00:23.207 --> 00:25.930
It's objective is to generate interest in a reviewer...

00:26.313 --> 00:28.969
...to look at your detailed resume and get an interview.

00:29.618 --> 00:33.131
Some HR professionals think a cover letter is not important,...

00:33.379 --> 00:35.955
...but we know it can give you an edge over others.

00:36.759 --> 00:40.709
Now, here are a few tips to help you prepare that perfect cover letter.

00:41.295 --> 00:44.337
Tip number 1: Address to the right person.

00:44.942 --> 00:48.529
Avoid general salutations such as, "Dear HR Manager."

00:49.357 --> 00:50.327
Don't be cold.

00:50.512 --> 00:51.243
Be personal.

00:51.688 --> 00:55.188
Find out who is in charge and address your document to the right person.

00:56.209 --> 00:58.712
Tip number 2: Make your cover letter concise.

00:59.609 --> 01:00.371
Don't overwrite.

01:00.939 --> 01:05.009
Keep it to three paragraphs and have all your information within one A4 page.

01:06.163 --> 01:10.899
Start the letter by telling HR how you learned about the organization and the job opening.

01:11.365 --> 01:13.480
If the company is good, sing its praises.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.644
A little bootlicking goes a long way.

01:17.113 --> 01:20.278
In paragraph two, justify why you are perfect for the job...

01:20.731 --> 01:22.349
...and how you can contribute to the company.

01:23.488 --> 01:27.497
You should also include your education qualification and previous job accomplishments.

01:28.400 --> 01:33.503
Remember to quantify your accomplishments with evidence such as statistics and awards.

01:35.384 --> 01:38.869
The final paragraph is where you leave that positive, lasting impression...

01:39.157 --> 01:41.015
...by reaffirming your interest in the job.

01:42.354 --> 01:45.690
Remember to include your contact details, and most importantly,...

01:46.065 --> 01:47.527
...don't forget to thank the reviewer.

01:48.729 --> 01:51.727
Tip number 3: Never reuse your cover letter.

01:52.331 --> 01:54.059
Each job vacancy is unique.

01:54.850 --> 01:57.848
You should therefore customize your cover letter accordingly.

01:58.270 --> 01:59.185
Don't be lazy!

01:59.711 --> 02:02.583
So to summarize the ingredients of a good cover letter.

02:03.007 --> 02:05.541
Number 1: Address to the right person.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.685
Number 2: Keep it concise.

02:08.006 --> 02:11.747
And finally, number 3: Never reuse your cover letter.
