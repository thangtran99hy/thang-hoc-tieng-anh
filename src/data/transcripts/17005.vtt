00:10.877 --> 00:12.771
You should be nice to nerds.

00:14.431 --> 00:16.813
In fact, I'd go so far as to say,...

00:16.878 --> 00:19.578
..."If you don't already have a nerd in your life, you should get one."

00:21.415 --> 00:22.230
I'm just saying.

00:23.529 --> 00:27.110
Scientists and engineers change the world.

00:29.186 --> 00:32.899
I'd like to tell you about a magical place called DARPA...

00:33.359 --> 00:39.835
...where scientists and engineers defy the impossible and refuse to fear failure.

00:41.053 --> 00:44.521
Now, these two ideas are connected more than you may realize...

00:45.192 --> 00:53.651
...because when you remove the fear of failure, impossible things suddenly become possible.

00:55.294 --> 00:58.925
If you want to know how, ask yourself this question,...

01:00.359 --> 01:04.207
... "What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?"

01:05.719 --> 01:11.510
If you really ask yourself this question, you can't help but feel uncomfortable.

01:12.308 --> 01:14.311
I feel a little uncomfortable...

01:15.445 --> 01:21.991
...because when you ask it, you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you,...

01:22.746 --> 01:29.434
...how it keeps us from attempting great things, and life gets dull;

01:30.683 --> 01:33.387
...amazing things stop happening.

01:33.773 --> 01:39.213
Sure, good things happen, but amazing things stop happening.

01:39.856 --> 01:49.171
Now I should be clear, I'm not encouraging failure; I'm discouraging fear of failure...

01:50.187 --> 01:54.111
...because it's not failure itself that constrains us.

01:54.455 --> 02:00.744
The path to truly new, never been done before things always has failure along the way;

02:01.577 --> 02:02.473
...we're tested.

02:03.415 --> 02:09.295
And in part, that testing feels an appropriate part of achieving something great.

02:10.531 --> 02:15.199
Clemenceau said, "Life gets interesting when we fail,...

02:16.031 --> 02:19.610
...because it's a sign that we've surpassed ourselves."

02:20.336 --> 02:27.359
In 1895, Lord Kelvin declared that heavier than air flying machines were impossible.

02:28.173 --> 02:30.319
In October of 1903,...

02:30.603 --> 02:34.529
...the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists...

02:34.906 --> 02:39.719
...was that maybe in ten million years we could build an aircraft that would fly.

02:40.411 --> 02:43.219
And two months later on December 17th,...

02:43.747 --> 02:48.985
...Orville Wright powered the first airplane across a beach in North Carolina.

02:50.003 --> 02:54.083
The flight lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 feet.

02:55.563 --> 02:57.317
That was 1903.

02:57.733 --> 03:02.143
One year later, the next declarations of impossibilities began.

03:02.603 --> 03:05.713
Ferdinand Foch, a French army general...

03:05.974 --> 03:11.657
...credited with having one of the most original and subtle minds in the French army said,...

03:12.039 --> 03:17.240
..."Airplanes are interesting toys, but of no military value."

03:18.490 --> 03:23.780
40 years later, aero experts coined the term "transonic".

03:24.059 --> 03:26.895
They debated, "Should it have one S or two?"

03:28.537 --> 03:31.329
You see, they were having trouble in this flight regime,...

03:31.720 --> 03:36.494
...and it wasn't at all clear that we could fly faster than the speed of sound.

03:37.238 --> 03:44.794
In 1947, there was no wind tunnel data beyond Mach 0.85.

03:46.139 --> 03:53.278
And yet, on Tuesday, October 14th, 1947,...

03:53.913 --> 03:58.061
...Chuck Yeager climbed into the cockpit of his Bell X-1...

03:58.554 --> 04:03.190
...and he flew towards an unknown possibility,...

04:04.241 --> 04:10.840
...and in so doing, he became the first pilot to fly faster than the speed of sound.

04:16.987 --> 04:20.583
Six of eight Atlas rockets blew up on the pad.

04:21.071 --> 04:25.903
After 11 complete mission failures, we got our first images from space.

04:26.230 --> 04:32.029
And on that first flight we got more data than in all U-2 missions combined.

04:34.577 --> 04:37.554
It took a lot of failures to get there.

04:38.699 --> 04:44.931
Since we took to the sky, we have wanted to fly faster and farther.

04:45.713 --> 04:50.489
And to do so, we've had to believe in impossible things.

04:50.939 --> 04:54.218
And we've had to refuse to fear failure.

04:55.151 --> 04:57.746
That's still true today.
