Hi, I'm Richard Bartrem, Vice President of Communications for WestJet.

00:03.965 --> 00:05.193
Here is some exciting news.

00:05.700 --> 00:09.823
Effective today, we're introducing child-free cabins on board select flights.

00:10.442 --> 00:11.847
We've heard from many of our guests...

00:12.152 --> 00:14.733
...that they're tired of kids screaming and running up and down the aisle...

00:15.014 --> 00:17.555
...and are looking quite simply for some peace and quiet.

00:18.070 --> 00:21.549
So, you may be asking, "How do I get my children to their destination?"

00:22.059 --> 00:24.397
Well, that's a great question and we've got a great answer.

00:24.621 --> 00:26.457
We call it "Kargo Kids."

00:27.165 --> 00:28.467
Let's take a look at the process.

00:29.298 --> 00:32.843
When you arrive at the airport, simply ask for Kargo Kids when you check in.

00:33.824 --> 00:37.075
Our friendly WestJet customer service agents are more than happy to help.

00:37.748 --> 00:41.490
They'll assist you in getting your child ready for their trip on a travel toboggan.

00:43.289 --> 00:47.339
Your child will be whisked away in a magic carpet ride and your work is done.

00:47.786 --> 00:50.087
Meanwhile, our WestJetters are hard at work.

00:50.431 --> 00:53.013
Your child's toboggan will arrive safely with the luggage...

00:53.222 --> 00:55.415
...and other kids who will be boarding that flight.

00:56.223 --> 00:59.916
From there, one of our friendly WestJetters will take the children to their waiting flight.

01:00.723 --> 01:03.515
On board each flight, we have a Kargo Kids counselor...

01:03.737 --> 01:07.211
...who's there to make sure that your kids are well taken care of and supervised.

01:07.551 --> 01:09.963
With plenty of toys and a state-of-the-art feed trough,...

01:10.213 --> 01:14.411
...your children will be able to run and play, scream and eat all they want...

01:14.635 --> 01:17.089
...while you enjoy your flight in peace and quiet.

01:18.567 --> 01:22.391
So book Kargo Kids today by going to westJet.com/kargokids,...

01:22.609 --> 01:24.736
...that's "Kargo" and "Kids" with a "K"...

01:25.031 --> 01:27.292
...and let us give you the peace and quiet you need.

01:27.989 --> 01:30.375
From all of us at WestJet, you're welcome.

01:31.901 --> 01:34.125
