00:04.197 --> 00:05.830
Mrs. Kruthers, welcome.

00:06.114 --> 00:06.519
Thank you.

00:06.627 --> 00:07.891
Come on in, have a seat.

00:08.271 --> 00:09.337
Of course.

00:09.819 --> 00:13.871
I have been looking over your resume and I have to say I am very impressed.

00:13.941 --> 00:14.847
Oh, thank you.

00:15.222 --> 00:19.709
You know, actually I think, to be honest, you are overqualified to be an accountant.

00:20.177 --> 00:22.955
Oh well, that's okay, I don't intend to work very hard.

00:28.020 --> 00:28.366
Really?

00:29.635 --> 00:32.478
Absolutely! In fact, I only intend to show up when I feel like it,...

00:32.577 --> 00:37.193
...which is good because I've a wide variety of extremely annoying personal habits...

00:37.272 --> 00:39.125
...and absolutely no sense of hygiene.

00:41.433 --> 00:48.970
Oh! You know, then I don't feel like you're the correct person for this position.

00:49.338 --> 00:50.245
That's okay, I quit.

00:50.995 --> 00:52.154
You can't quit, you don't work here.

00:52.464 --> 00:53.460
Like, I would ever work here.

00:54.028 --> 00:55.343
Like, we would ever hire you.

00:55.663 --> 00:56.307
Oh yeah?

00:57.218 --> 00:59.581
Yeah. And even if you did work here...

00:59.674 --> 01:02.965
...I wouldn't even give you the opportunity to quit because I would fire you.

01:03.099 --> 01:06.387
Well, you can't fire me because I don't work here.

01:06.767 --> 01:10.527
That's right! You don't and I would can your ass so quick.

01:10.684 --> 01:11.281
Prove it.

01:13.614 --> 01:16.709
Okay. You've got the job.

01:17.209 --> 01:17.705
Thank you.

01:17.779 --> 01:20.843
You're welcome and now it is my pleasure to inform you that...

01:20.940 --> 01:21.857
I quit.

01:23.139 --> 01:24.810
You can't quit, I fired you.

01:25.010 --> 01:27.572
No, it's too late I don't work here anymore.

01:29.650 --> 01:30.816
Fine, let's try this again.

01:30.889 --> 01:32.589
You've got the job and now you're fired.

01:32.986 --> 01:36.253
No, you offered me the job but I never accepted.

01:36.343 --> 01:39.593
Look, I've already worked for you, it's very tedious.

01:40.057 --> 01:43.321
And now you want me back I think it's a regressive career move.

01:44.427 --> 01:48.084
Okay, what can we do to get you to come work for us?

01:49.288 --> 01:49.932
A raise.

01:50.176 --> 01:50.821
A raise?

01:51.017 --> 01:52.236
$200 an hour.

01:52.696 --> 01:58.250
200 an hour? Okay, prorated to this ten seconds you're gonna be working here so, 12 cents?

01:58.367 --> 01:59.562
And this time I promise I won't quit.

02:00.073 --> 02:03.281
You promise you won't quit, you promise you'll let me fire you.

02:03.423 --> 02:04.141
If you still want to.

02:05.418 --> 02:06.850
I'm sure I'm going to want to.

02:08.139 --> 02:08.733
So, we have a deal?

02:11.329 --> 02:11.852
Not yet.

02:12.357 --> 02:14.082
I've already been an accountant here.

02:14.275 --> 02:15.632
I feel like I've outgrown the position.

02:15.805 --> 02:16.509
I want something higher.

02:16.861 --> 02:21.467
How about Junior Vice President?

02:22.657 --> 02:27.692
Junior Vice President? $200 an hour or 12 cents whichever comes first...

02:27.761 --> 02:31.953
...and you promise not to quit before I have the opportunity to fire you.

02:32.326 --> 02:32.971
That's correct.

02:34.973 --> 02:37.020
Great! You've got the job.

02:37.185 --> 02:37.915
I accept.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.467
Great! Now, you're fired.

02:41.594 --> 02:45.536
You can't fire me, I'm Junior Vice President. I'm your boss.

02:48.339 --> 02:50.675
Well, that doesn't make sense.

02:50.759 --> 02:57.403
And as your boss, I regret that I have to fire you.

03:02.251 --> 03:03.295
Why are you firing me?

03:04.018 --> 03:07.967
Well, I can't help but notice that as head of personnel...

03:08.097 --> 03:15.522
...you've been hiring some very strange people lately, at $200 an hour for me.

03:17.909 --> 03:19.527
What am I supposed to do without a job?

03:20.973 --> 03:23.985
Well, we do have a new position opening up in head of personnel.

03:24.795 --> 03:25.771
Do you have any experience?
