A resume without a cover letter is like a burger without a bun.

00:09.690 --> 00:11.667
If you really wanted a job from somebody,...

00:11.791 --> 00:14.015
...you wouldn't send them a burger without a bun, would you? 

00:14.289 --> 00:15.159
Of course not.

00:16.028 --> 00:20.663
You will need: a computer, typewriter, or some other mechanical writing device...

00:20.812 --> 00:22.643
...a cover letter should never be handwritten.

00:23.145 --> 00:26.029
Step one: Address the letter to a specific person.

00:26.342 --> 00:28.463
Writing "to whom it may concern" is lazy. 

00:28.728 --> 00:31.193
Tracking down the right person shows real moxie.

00:32.251 --> 00:35.002
If you're unsure who to write, call the company and ask.

00:35.289 --> 00:38.210
Make sure you get their exact title and correct spelling of their name.

00:38.861 --> 00:42.695
Step two: Open your letter with a short introduction that gets right to the point;...

00:43.057 --> 00:45.525
...say what position you're after and how you found out about it.

00:46.345 --> 00:49.761
Step three: Demonstrate that you understand what the company does,...

00:49.872 --> 00:51.987
...and show enthusiasm for whatever that is.

00:52.889 --> 00:56.112
Read through the company's website to find details you can mention in your letter.

00:56.777 --> 01:00.219
Step four: Relate your past work experience to the current opening.

01:00.569 --> 01:04.675
Don't count on employers to connect the dots and realize how your previous jobs are relevant.

01:05.301 --> 01:07.917
Step five: If you're responding to a job posting,...

01:08.138 --> 01:11.163
...adapt your writing to address specific things mentioned in the post.

01:11.897 --> 01:13.932
Keep your cover letter short and concise.

01:14.136 --> 01:15.629
It shouldn't be longer than a page.

01:15.922 --> 01:17.520
A few brief paragraphs is enough.

01:18.123 --> 01:22.535
Step six: If you are attaching additional materials, like a portfolio or a reel,...

01:22.865 --> 01:24.167
...mention that at the end of the letter.

01:24.847 --> 01:30.765
Step seven: After thanking your reader, sign off with a suitable closing, like "Sincerely" or "Best."

01:30.917 --> 01:32.473
And type your name on the next line.

01:32.767 --> 01:35.819
If you're mailing your letter, leave four blank lines between your closing...

01:35.884 --> 01:38.177
...and your typed name so you have room for your signature.

01:38.780 --> 01:43.769
Step eight: Make sure you've included all your contact information, even if it's already on your resume.

01:44.576 --> 01:48.170
Step nine: Proofread your letter carefully, word by word.

01:48.608 --> 01:49.583
Have a friend read it over. 

01:49.903 --> 01:50.977
At least twice.

01:51.833 --> 01:56.073
If you're emailing the letter, send it to yourself first to make sure there are no formatting errors.

01:57.691 --> 01:59.692
Step ten: Send your letter!

01:59.956 --> 02:03.091
And rest assured that your extra care will set you apart from the crowd.

02:04.401 --> 02:08.683
Did you know? The average cover letter is in an employer's hands for eight seconds.
