I've never really liked anything as much as I like being a dad.

00:07.579 --> 00:12.122
I mean, the first week after we brought him home, I went way, way overboard with the pictures.

00:13.570 --> 00:15.871
Even his mom was like, "You need to chill out, man."

00:17.199 --> 00:18.601
I just didn't want to forget that stuff,...

00:18.695 --> 00:19.013
...you know?

00:20.025 --> 00:21.855
But then I did manage to forget one thing,...

00:22.958 --> 00:24.581
...my phone in a cab.

00:25.508 --> 00:27.588
The phone was whatever. I'd lost like a million phones.

00:27.669 --> 00:31.571
But this time, it was different because it did actually matter.

00:32.658 --> 00:35.328
Every photo I'd ever taken of him, I'd taken on that phone.

00:36.181 --> 00:37.083
And they were just gone.

00:43.957 --> 00:47.170
Then, I realized that I hadn't lost anything at all.

00:48.614 --> 00:49.547
They were all still there.
