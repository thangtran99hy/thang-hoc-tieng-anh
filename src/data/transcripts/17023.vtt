Meet 40-year-old Shifu Shi Yan Ming who claims he has a very special power.

00:14.297 --> 00:14.996
Do I feel pain?

00:15.795 --> 00:16.709
I do not feel pain.

00:26.098 --> 00:29.357
Shifu has been a Shaolin monk since the age of five.

00:30.919 --> 00:33.201
When I was a child, I almost died.

00:34.449 --> 00:38.641
Luckily, the acupuncture doctor saved my life.

00:39.935 --> 00:42.423
After that, my parents took me to Shaolin Temple.

00:43.561 --> 00:45.739
Since from then, I never got sick.

00:50.193 --> 00:55.103
Shaolin fighting monks practice a unique combination of martial arts and Chan Buddhism,...

00:55.545 --> 00:58.227
...the spiritual parents of Japan's Zen Buddhism.

01:01.527 --> 01:06.913
Shifu defected from China on a Shaolin Temple monks tour of the US in 1992.

01:07.975 --> 01:11.885
Two months later, he had founded the USA Shaolin Temple.

01:13.171 --> 01:17.711
To share the knowledge with other people, it's the most enjoyable thing.

01:18.255 --> 01:21.216
You have wonderful things to share with other people.

01:26.156 --> 01:30.410
And one thing he wants to share is not only how to tolerate pain...

01:30.727 --> 01:31.915
You can control the pain.

01:32.845 --> 01:33.452
Control the fear.

01:35.997 --> 01:36.416
No problem.

01:38.076 --> 01:39.460
...but learning to love it.

01:40.245 --> 01:48.086
When the hammer smashed the stone, I feel fantastic!

01:49.397 --> 01:50.972
Yeah, I  feel wonderful.

01:53.541 --> 01:53.899
Truly.

01:56.109 --> 01:58.447
Pain is life.

01:59.762 --> 02:03.785
Dr. Kamran Fallahpour is the director of the Brain Resource Center of New York.

02:05.910 --> 02:11.003
Today, he is testing Shifu's power to withstand pain with a biofeedback machine,...

02:11.330 --> 02:14.995
...which measures responses on the skin from the nervous system to stress,...

02:15.535 --> 02:17.501
...known as electrodermal activity.

02:18.047 --> 02:23.438
And we're also looking at heart rate and we're also looking at EEG activity, brain activity.

02:28.531 --> 02:32.956
Dr. Fallahpour found that Shifu's electrodermal activity was unusually high...

02:33.090 --> 02:37.800
...just before the impact and unusually relaxed immediately afterwards.

02:38.171 --> 02:41.824
In other words, he had mentally prepared himself for pain.

02:42.062 --> 02:46.113
He's been able to basically shift his own perception of what pain means.
