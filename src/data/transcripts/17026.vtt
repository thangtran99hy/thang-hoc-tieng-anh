00:03.100 --> 00:07.934
It was a marvel of the modern age, a ship its operators built as unsinkable.

00:08.308 --> 00:14.597
On April 10th 1912, the RMS Titanic, crammed with over 2,200 passengers and crew,...

00:15.096 --> 00:17.461
...departed from Southampton bound for New York.

00:18.301 --> 00:22.783
For many on board, the voyage was an opportunity to escape poverty and create a new life.

00:23.258 --> 00:27.043
For other wealthier passengers, it was an enjoyable social voyage.

00:28.015 --> 00:32.295
The ship docked at Cherbourg and Queenstown in Ireland before the crossing to New York.

00:32.813 --> 00:36.263
But just five days in early on the morning of April 15th,...

00:36.411 --> 00:39.727
...the ship hit an iceberg, tearing a vast hole in her side.

00:40.882 --> 00:43.755
Chaos ensued as Titanic began taking on water...

00:43.929 --> 00:47.337
...and the crew and passengers scrambled for what few lifeboats there were.

00:47.774 --> 00:51.216
Many left half full, leaving those trapped on board to their fate.

00:51.827 --> 00:58.224
Just three hours later, the ship split in half and sank with 1,517 lives lost.

00:58.663 --> 01:01.751
Just one hour later, rescue arrived for the survivors...

01:01.821 --> 01:04.467
...in the shape of the Carpathia, a passenger liner.

01:05.444 --> 01:07.801
The ship would become a legend, spawning books...

01:07.877 --> 01:10.871
...and one of the most successful films in Hollywood history.

01:11.358 --> 01:17.002
More importantly, it would also result in a shipping safety revolution which has endured to this day.

01:17.814 --> 01:21.485
But the greatest legacy of the disaster is the memory of Titanic herself,...

01:22.041 --> 01:26.965
...a name which conjures images of one of the most memorable tragedies in maritime history.
