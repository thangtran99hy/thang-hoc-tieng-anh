00:00.437 --> 00:04.183
So today, we turn to you.

00:05.047 --> 00:08.153
You are the promise for a more equal world.

00:08.686 --> 00:09.816
You are our hope.

00:11.169 --> 00:16.284
I truly believe that only when we get real equality in our governments, in our businesses,...

00:16.669 --> 00:22.035
...in our companies, in our universities, will we start to solve this generation's central moral problem,...

00:22.564 --> 00:23.883
...which is gender equality.

00:24.822 --> 00:30.697
We need women at all levels, including the top, to change the dynamic, reshape the conversation,...

00:31.450 --> 00:37.175
...to make sure women's voices are heard and heeded, not overlooked and ignored.

00:39.185 --> 00:42.523
So my hope for all of you here, for every single one of you,...

00:43.165 --> 00:45.779
...is that you're gonna walk across the stage and get your diploma.

00:46.205 --> 00:49.439
You're gonna go out tonight or maybe all summer and celebrate, you deserve it.

00:51.234 --> 00:55.141
And then, you're gonna lean way into your career.

00:56.032 --> 00:59.627
You're gonna find something you love doing, and you're gonna do it with gusto.

01:00.238 --> 01:05.689
You're gonna pick your field and you're gonna ride it all the way to the top.

01:18.136 --> 01:20.843
So, what advice can I give you to help you achieve this goal?

01:21.790 --> 01:24.813
The first thing is I encourage you to think big.

01:25.568 --> 01:30.554
Studies show very clearly that in our country, in the college educated part of the population,...

01:30.874 --> 01:32.272
...men are more ambitious than women.

01:33.037 --> 01:35.411
They're more ambitious the day they graduate from college,...

01:35.707 --> 01:38.974
...they remain more ambitious every step along their career path.

01:39.777 --> 01:43.687
We will never close the achievement gap until we close the ambition gap.

01:44.835 --> 01:49.481
But if all young women start to lean in, we can close the ambition gap right here, right now,...

01:50.095 --> 01:52.285
...if every single one of you leans in.

01:53.174 --> 01:55.153
Leadership belongs to those who take it.

01:55.672 --> 01:57.326
Leadership starts with you.

02:00.065 --> 02:05.037
The next step is you're gonna have to believe in yourself potentially more than you do today.

02:05.999 --> 02:10.740
Studies also show that compared to men, women underestimate their performance.

02:11.169 --> 02:16.913
If you ask men and women questions about completely objective criteria such as GPAs or sales goals,...

02:17.531 --> 02:20.991
...men get it wrong slightly high, women get it wrong slightly low.

02:21.879 --> 02:27.644
More importantly, if you ask men why they succeeded, men attribute that success to themselves,...

02:27.729 --> 02:31.793
...and women, they attribute it to other factors like working harder, help from others.
