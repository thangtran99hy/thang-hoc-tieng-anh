Since nearly the beginning of human history, maps have shaped the world we live in...

00:04.629 --> 00:06.533
...and marked important milestones in our advancement.

00:08.283 --> 00:10.571
Cavemen drew maps to help remember where to hunt and gather.

00:12.832 --> 00:14.419
Expert cartographers charted maps...

00:14.503 --> 00:17.651
...to help explorers navigate little-known places and define borders.

00:19.935 --> 00:22.608
Scientists mapped space to help mankind reach the moon.

00:24.589 --> 00:28.141
Today's digital maps are more sophisticated but some things haven't changed.

00:28.957 --> 00:31.020
Our maps still help us get to where we want to go,...

00:31.564 --> 00:34.331
...guide us when we're lost, and perhaps most importantly,...

00:34.896 --> 00:37.348
...give individuals the ability to change the world.

00:38.364 --> 00:40.723
In 2005, Rebecca Moore used Google Earth...

00:40.814 --> 00:42.657
...to illustrate the impact of a planned development...

00:43.793 --> 00:46.178
...and convinced her community to come up with a better alternative.

00:47.942 --> 00:50.064
From this effort, Google Earth Outreach was born...

00:50.481 --> 00:54.275
...in order to give anyone the tools to change the world with maps.

00:55.505 --> 00:57.660
Since then, different people in organizations...

00:57.718 --> 01:01.753
...have been creating real, long-lasting social change using these tools.

01:02.816 --> 01:04.460
Their maps help to protect the environment,...

01:09.950 --> 01:11.332
...provide better crisis response,...

01:17.081 --> 01:18.959
...improve safety and save lives,...

01:27.173 --> 01:28.255
...and even preserve a culture.

01:39.337 --> 01:43.385
Through Google Earth Outreach, these organizations are using digital mapping tools...

01:43.694 --> 01:45.158
...to write their own chapter in history.

01:46.303 --> 01:47.145
Google Earth Outreach.

01:47.770 --> 01:49.646
How will you use maps to change the world?
