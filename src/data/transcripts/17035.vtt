How to write a cover letter.

00:02.588 --> 00:05.883
Now that you've worked out your resume to an almost staggering perfection,...

00:06.279 --> 00:09.132
...what's next for you to do is to create a powerful cover letter.

00:09.587 --> 00:14.248
HR professionals have often suggested that the cover letter is what really gets read.

00:14.633 --> 00:18.315
This means that your cover letter should be just as compelling as your resume.

00:18.855 --> 00:21.875
Remember that you're about to submit an application package,...

00:22.093 --> 00:25.890
...so your cover letter should match your resume in presentation and style.

00:26.220 --> 00:30.696
Also, make an effort to get the name of the hiring authority you'll be addressing your letter to.

00:31.109 --> 00:35.477
This sends out a message that you're genuinely interested in joining a particular company...

00:35.880 --> 00:37.696
...rather than just finding another job.

00:38.173 --> 00:40.884
Try not to put in those details already in your resume.

00:41.333 --> 00:45.005
Instead, pack your cover letter up with statements that grab attention.

00:45.555 --> 00:49.913
Candidates often forget that their application is supposed to meet a need in the company.

00:50.401 --> 00:55.137
Your cover letter should focus on their requirements and how your qualifications can meet them.

00:55.511 --> 00:58.471
Employers should realize that hiring you is the solution.

00:58.853 --> 01:02.589
Lastly, your cover letter and resume are two different playing cards.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.357
Even if your cover letter should summarize your resume,...

01:05.705 --> 01:09.858
...make sure to use it as an added means to express your value to the organization.
