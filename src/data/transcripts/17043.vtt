00:15.471 --> 00:20.874
When I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old, we were playing on top of a bunk bed.

00:21.351 --> 00:25.317
I was two years older than my sister at the time. I mean, I'm two years older than her now.

00:25.455 --> 00:30.789
But at the time that meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do and I wanted to play war.

00:31.061 --> 00:36.729
So we were up on top of our bunk beds and on one side of the bunk bed, I had put out all of my GI Joe soldiers and weaponry.

00:36.860 --> 00:41.799
And on the other side were all my sister's My Little Ponies ready for a cavalry charge.

00:42.327 --> 00:47.414
There are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon, but since my sister is not here with us today,...

00:48.213 --> 00:53.257
...let me tell you the true story which is my sister's a little bit on the clumsy side.

00:53.330 --> 00:56.071
And somehow, without any help or push from her older brother at all,...

00:56.411 --> 01:00.523
...suddenly Amy disappeared off of the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor.

01:00.883 --> 01:04.765
Now I nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister...

01:05.104 --> 01:08.735
...and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground.

01:09.179 --> 01:15.638
I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safely and as quietly as possible.

01:16.215 --> 01:20.682
And seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy's arm just one week before,...

01:26.145 --> 01:30.609
...heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet.

01:33.173 --> 01:35.669
For which I have yet to be thanked, I was trying as hard as I could.

01:37.482 --> 01:40.816
She didn't even see it coming. I was trying as hard as I could to be on my best behavior.

01:40.877 --> 01:45.682
And I saw in my sister's face, this wail of pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth...

01:45.787 --> 01:48.899
...and threatening to wake my parents from the long winter's nap for which they had settled.

01:49.267 --> 01:54.254
So I did the only thing my little frantic seven-year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy.

01:54.365 --> 01:56.624
If you have children, you've seen this hundreds of times before.

01:56.683 --> 01:58.226
I said, "Amy, Amy, wait. Don't cry. Don't cry."

01:58.505 --> 01:59.465
"Did you see how you landed?"

02:00.057 --> 02:02.103
"No human lands on all fours like that."

02:03.543 --> 02:05.777
"Amy, I think this means you're a unicorn."

02:09.489 --> 02:12.317
Now that was cheating, because there was nothing in the world my sister would want more...

02:12.409 --> 02:15.735
...than not to be Amy the hurt five-year-old little sister, but to be Amy the special unicorn.

02:15.837 --> 02:18.769
Of course, this was an option that was open to her brain at no point in the past.

02:19.027 --> 02:22.018
And you could see on my poor manipulated sister's face conflict.

02:22.679 --> 02:27.907
As her little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced,...

02:28.320 --> 02:30.716
...or contemplating her newfound identity as a unicorn.

02:31.858 --> 02:32.641
And the latter won out.

02:32.722 --> 02:37.770
Instead of crying, instead of ceasing our play, instead of waking my parents with all the negative consequences that would have ensued for me,...

02:38.297 --> 02:47.471
...instead a smile spread across her face and she scrambled right back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn. With one broken leg.

02:47.902 --> 02:53.065
What we stumbled across at this tender age of just five and seven, we had no idea at the time,...

02:53.149 --> 02:59.445
...was something that was going to be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain.

02:59.723 --> 03:02.242
What we had stumbled across is something called positive psychology,...

03:02.333 --> 03:05.973
...which is the reason that I'm here today and the reason that I wake up every morning.

03:06.301 --> 03:10.179
When I first started talking about this research outside of academia, out with companies and schools,...

03:10.271 --> 03:13.520
...the very first thing they said to never do is to start your talk with a graph.

03:13.943 --> 03:16.034
The very first thing I want to do is start my talk with a graph.

03:16.351 --> 03:20.464
This graph looks boring, but this graph is the reason I get excited and wake up every morning.

03:20.552 --> 03:22.548
And this graph doesn't even mean anything. It's fake data.

03:22.656 --> 03:31.419
What we found is... if I got this data back studying you here in the room, I would be thrilled.

03:31.519 --> 03:36.228
Because there's very clearly a trend that's going on there, and that means that I can get published, which is all that really matters.

03:37.619 --> 03:41.319
The fact that there's one weird red dot that's up above the curve, there's one weirdo in the room.

03:41.423 --> 03:45.762
You know who you are, I saw you earlier. That's no problem.

03:46.089 --> 03:49.695
That's no problem, as most of you know, because I can just delete that dot.

03:50.767 --> 03:53.031
I can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error.

03:53.128 --> 03:55.885
And we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data.
