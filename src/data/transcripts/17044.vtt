00:02.559 --> 00:03.443
Thanks for coming out guys.

00:03.633 --> 00:05.391
Today's mission is called "quadruplets."

00:05.613 --> 00:08.554
We have eight sets of identical quadruplets.

00:08.787 --> 00:10.599
We're gonna take you guys out into the park,...

00:10.851 --> 00:12.923
...sit you on park benches, next to each other,...

00:13.185 --> 00:16.427
...and create a surreal experience for anyone who happens to walk by.

01:15.128 --> 01:16.097
Do you guys know what's going on?

01:20.182 --> 01:21.600
They all kinda look the same.

01:22.148 --> 01:23.761
Just like that. I've never seen it.

01:25.834 --> 01:26.803
Is this a convention?

01:27.247 --> 01:28.123
There's more down there.

01:28.659 --> 01:29.708
Yeah, there's more of them now.

01:59.569 --> 02:00.823
That's the weirdest thing I've ever seen.
