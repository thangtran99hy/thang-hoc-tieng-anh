Email is one of those potentially powerful tools that actually turns into an Achilles' heel if not managed.

00:07.188 --> 00:10.204
A lot of us hit the "Send" button and ruin our careers,...

00:10.725 --> 00:12.066
...wishing we could take back what we've just sent.

00:12.370 --> 00:16.109
So here's a few rules of email that will lead to better living.

00:16.793 --> 00:19.591
Rule number one. Never send an email when you're mad.

00:20.015 --> 00:20.913
And if you want to know you're mad,...

00:21.200 --> 00:24.058
...just take two fingers, close your eyes, touch your eyelids.

00:24.550 --> 00:28.173
If they're hot, researchers say, you're mad and you should put it in the draft pile.

00:28.312 --> 00:29.025
Send it later.

00:29.277 --> 00:31.960
One of the things I've learned is that email is for saying yes.

00:32.530 --> 00:34.690
Email is for answering and asking questions.

00:35.234 --> 00:39.297
If you say no, if you criticize, if you attack, please do it in person.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.187
Or at the worst case, do it over the phone.

00:41.800 --> 00:44.127
Two more quick rules. Stamp out "Reply to all."

00:44.523 --> 00:45.719
I call it the sortie campaign.

00:46.488 --> 00:47.970
"Reply to all"" is considered arrogant.

00:48.542 --> 00:51.453
It is considered unsophisticated, especially by younger workers.

00:51.983 --> 00:57.133
Don't be lazy. Take the time to actually respond just to the people that need to get that email from you.

00:57.795 --> 01:03.763
Never send emails to your subordinates after hours, on the weekends or during holidays.

01:04.445 --> 01:06.608
When you send someone an email at three in the morning,...

01:07.240 --> 01:08.500
...you're sending the following message:...

01:09.100 --> 01:13.621
..."You should feel guilty when you go home next Tuesday at 7:30 for dinner."

01:14.010 --> 01:17.802
If you have an inspiration off hours, write it, put it in the "Send later" pile...

01:18.400 --> 01:20.700
...and send it during normal business hours.
