If you find yourself loving someone who is no good for you, do a little self-examination.

00:05.646 --> 00:09.601
If you find that your relationship is toxic, accept it for what it is:...

00:09.847 --> 00:11.711
...attraction, not love.

00:12.353 --> 00:15.702
People in toxic relationships are looking for a partner in crime;...

00:15.781 --> 00:18.541
...someone to join them in their path to destruction.

00:18.857 --> 00:23.467
Maybe, for example, you find someone who has some of the same self-esteem issues as you do...

00:23.877 --> 00:25.885
...or emotional challenges as you.

00:26.407 --> 00:32.095
Together you each have someone to share your misery with, a mate to complain to and complain about.

00:32.575 --> 00:39.411
These are relationships based on a toxic attraction and they should not be confused with love relationships of any kind.

00:39.642 --> 00:41.573
Love is a very different process...

00:41.949 --> 00:46.444
...and has nothing to do with finding a partner to share your unhealthy patterns.

00:46.941 --> 00:50.395
Real love is able to transcend those patterns.
