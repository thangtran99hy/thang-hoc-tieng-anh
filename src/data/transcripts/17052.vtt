00:00.030 --> 00:01.425
Anytime you want to do something...

00:01.506 --> 00:04.042
...and asking for what you want is often a big thing.

00:04.413 --> 00:06.638
You've got to be willing to be a little terrified.

00:07.189 --> 00:10.746
You don't have to give in to the fear, but you have to be willing to feel it.

00:10.997 --> 00:12.432
Think of the things you'd like to do.

00:12.795 --> 00:15.661
Ask your boss for a raise, leave the job you hate,...

00:16.093 --> 00:17.701
...turn a work acquaintance into a friend,...

00:17.784 --> 00:21.067
...or ask some friends to take a look at your new business opportunity.

00:21.713 --> 00:24.356
Now, instead of saying, "I'm afraid to do one of these things,"...

00:24.990 --> 00:27.367
...figure out how you're scaring yourself.

00:27.741 --> 00:30.059
Make a statement that recognizes that feeling.

00:30.736 --> 00:32.551
Your statement will be something such as,...

00:33.056 --> 00:34.938
..."I wanna ask my boss for a raise,...

00:35.416 --> 00:39.982
...and I scare myself by imagining he'll say no or get mad at me for asking."

00:40.352 --> 00:41.210
Here's another example.

00:41.891 --> 00:44.483
"I want to show my friends my new business opportunity,...

00:44.896 --> 00:48.833
...and I scare myself by imagining that they'll think I'm only after their money."

00:49.703 --> 00:50.575
Do you see how it works?

00:51.173 --> 00:53.846
Acknowledge that you are creating your fear,...

00:54.196 --> 00:55.615
...and you'll start to triumph over it.
