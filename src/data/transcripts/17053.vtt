00:00.004 --> 00:01.295
It's not surprising...

00:01.565 --> 00:06.530
...that a lot of people buy into this corporate myth that you have got to be mean to win.

00:06.737 --> 00:10.767
Maybe you don't even know a lot of nice people that are successful but let me ask you this.

00:11.063 --> 00:15.394
Have you ever met a mean, successful person who was happy?

00:16.000 --> 00:16.973
'Cause that's important too.

00:17.283 --> 00:19.366
Let me give you an example of one who meets that test,...

00:19.689 --> 00:24.080
... Dwight Eisenhower, former President, former leader of our armed forces,...

00:24.215 --> 00:29.654
...Patton and MacArthur willingly reported to him because of phrases like, "I like Ike,"...

00:29.908 --> 00:32.609
...not born in politics but born on the battlefield...

00:32.730 --> 00:37.056
...by young men willing to risk their lives for this highly likable leader.

00:37.515 --> 00:42.858
As much as that was true in Eisenhower's day in the 21st century, it's more important than ever.

00:43.301 --> 00:47.192
Kids of today like my 20-year-old, they believe financial freedom has changed.

00:47.254 --> 00:49.858
To them, financial freedom is not about being debt-free,...

00:50.109 --> 00:54.533
...financial freedom is freedom not to work for a jerk.

00:55.191 --> 00:58.090
Besides, anybody knows that when you write a great story,...

00:58.181 --> 01:00.953
...you make the bad guy successful till about the middle of the movie,...

01:01.215 --> 01:03.727
...but you show me any bad guy that makes it till the end of the movie...

01:03.919 --> 01:06.231
...who's happy and successful, there you go.
