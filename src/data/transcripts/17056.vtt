Dick Clark rose to national popularity...

00:02.654 --> 00:06.297
...when rock and roll was still shocking and innocent at the same time.

00:06.683 --> 00:10.359
His smile gave the gyrations a stamp of adult approval.

00:10.965 --> 00:15.474
He once said it was very simple, "We played a record and the kids danced."

00:16.170 --> 00:22.859
But they danced through the decades, starting in 1957, 36 years of "American Bandstand."

00:26.523 --> 00:28.235
Changing styles of music.

00:33.111 --> 00:34.271
Different dances.

00:36.707 --> 00:39.317
As time went on, Clark barely seemed to age.

00:39.486 --> 00:42.126
He was nicknamed "America's oldest teenager."

00:42.474 --> 00:44.573
He just knew what would play with the kids.

00:50.177 --> 00:52.654
An appearance on "Bandstand" could make a career.

00:53.255 --> 00:57.179
Dick Clark gave a break to black artists as well, ahead of his time.

01:09.583 --> 01:12.511
Dick Clark didn't step into the spotlight,...

01:13.108 --> 01:16.410
...rather he stepped back and he spotlighted and showcased...

01:16.764 --> 01:19.614
...all the wonderful talent that has come through, through the years.

01:19.981 --> 01:21.320
And that's what has made him last.

01:21.913 --> 01:24.959
His ageless looks became the butt of jokes.

01:25.235 --> 01:27.997
I've been watching Dick Clark ever since I was a little kid.

01:29.321 --> 01:33.485
But his youthful enthusiasm put a mask on what was a sharp businessman.

01:34.015 --> 01:38.861
In the early days, he made a fortune investing in the music and artists he promoted on the show,...

01:39.216 --> 01:42.593
...until he was forced to sell his interest during the payola scandals.

01:43.240 --> 01:48.846
But he miraculously held on to "Bandstand" while some other big DJs lost their careers.

01:49.560 --> 01:52.007
He survived to create an empire.

01:52.411 --> 01:56.183
When he moved the show to Los Angeles, his Dick Clark Productions branched out...

01:56.307 --> 01:59.483
...into game shows, TV bloopers and practical jokes.

01:59.837 --> 02:03.697
And he took over as the host who ushered America into every New Year.

02:03.833 --> 02:07.453
Two, one. Happy 2000!

02:08.047 --> 02:13.141
He was someone who knew from the start what he wanted to do and did it the rest of his life.

02:13.259 --> 02:16.863
I knew when I was 13 what I wanted to do. That's very rare.

02:17.106 --> 02:21.481
I walked into a radio studio and saw Jimmy Durante and Gary Moore do a radio show and I said,...

02:21.775 --> 02:23.927
..."Wow, what a great way to make a living."

02:24.393 --> 02:29.471
The teenager of course did grow old, but his face is frozen in that time...

02:29.543 --> 02:33.789
...when music was new and being young seemed like it would last forever.

02:34.427 --> 02:37.177
