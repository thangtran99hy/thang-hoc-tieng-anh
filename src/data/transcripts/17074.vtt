00:06.119 --> 00:07.311
You have another nightmare?

00:08.015 --> 00:08.304
Yeah.

00:14.710 --> 00:17.099
Are you actually happy with how your life has turned out?

00:17.554 --> 00:18.622
Why the hell shouldn't I be?

00:20.359 --> 00:22.061
What do you know about this Rekall place?

00:22.415 --> 00:23.390
Stay away from them.

00:23.910 --> 00:25.201
They mess with your mind, man.

00:26.047 --> 00:26.975
Welcome to Rekall.

00:27.465 --> 00:28.066
First time?

00:30.169 --> 00:33.047
Tell us your fantasy, we'll give you the memory.

00:36.053 --> 00:37.519
You wanna be the crime fighter,...

00:38.027 --> 00:39.635
...or world-class athlete.

00:40.709 --> 00:41.541
Or secret agent.

00:41.807 --> 00:42.181
Yeah.

00:43.265 --> 00:44.477
Happy trails, man.

00:46.078 --> 00:46.731
What is it? What's wrong?

00:46.840 --> 00:48.072
Yank that needle off before it ticks!

00:49.038 --> 00:50.735
Why are you here? Why?

00:50.937 --> 00:51.663
Police!

00:53.887 --> 00:55.135
Oh, whoa! Wait, wait, wait!

00:55.468 --> 00:57.291
This is all a mistake. I'm a nobody.

00:57.447 --> 00:58.895
Hands on your head, now!

01:14.509 --> 01:15.271
Oh my god!

01:25.989 --> 01:26.923
Why are you trying to kill me?

01:28.813 --> 01:29.827
Your memory was erased.

01:30.194 --> 01:32.341
Your mind was implanted with the life you think you've lived.

01:32.841 --> 01:36.617
Oh, by the way, you haven't even begun to see me trying to kill you.

01:41.423 --> 01:41.720
Get in.

01:42.331 --> 01:43.745
I've been looking for you everywhere.

02:06.602 --> 02:09.810
If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?

02:10.340 --> 02:12.577
You don't have the most reliable of memories, do you?
