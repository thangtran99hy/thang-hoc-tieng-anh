00:01.127 --> 00:03.379
First, we're affected by what we know.

00:03.701 --> 00:06.670
When I talk to the kids in high school classes, college classes,...

00:06.703 --> 00:07.595
...that's the first thing I tell them.

00:07.804 --> 00:09.815
Get the information while you're here.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.445
Nothing worse than being stupid when you get out of school.

00:13.377 --> 00:15.632
So get the information, being broke is bad, but...

00:17.442 --> 00:19.013
...being stupid is what's really bad.

00:19.885 --> 00:22.652
And what's really really bad is being broke and stupid.

00:24.918 --> 00:28.600
Nothing much worse than that, unless you're sick, right?

00:28.722 --> 00:34.563
Sick, broke, and stupid that's about as far as you can fall unless you're ugly, right?

00:36.313 --> 00:38.025
But surely that would be the ultimate, right?

00:38.451 --> 00:41.961
The ultimate negative life - ugly, sick, broke and stupid.

00:43.805 --> 00:47.531
So learn all you can, we're affected by what we know.

00:47.913 --> 00:48.927
So get the information.

00:49.200 --> 00:53.288
Don't be lazy in learning, don't be lazy in going through the books, building your library,...

00:53.795 --> 00:55.850
...coming to classes like this, consistently, consistently.

00:55.997 --> 00:59.079
Some of them will be so dramatic, your life will never be the same.
