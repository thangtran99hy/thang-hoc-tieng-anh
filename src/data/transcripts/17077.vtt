From the creators of "The Last Airbender" comes the story of a new generation.

00:11.202 --> 00:14.221
What makes you so sure your daughter is "The One"?

00:23.771 --> 00:27.549
That was a 2000-year old historical treasure.

00:27.704 --> 00:28.201
Whoops.

00:29.020 --> 00:34.861
It's time for your generation to take on the responsibility of keeping peace and balance in the world.

00:35.912 --> 00:38.697
Your best friend is a polar bear dog.

00:43.194 --> 00:44.966
Somehow that makes perfect sense.

00:45.436 --> 00:46.997
Who do you think you are?

00:47.198 --> 00:48.910
Why don't you come and find out?

00:59.384 --> 01:02.211
The era of bending is over.

01:04.215 --> 01:06.581
Republic City does need you, but it needs me too.

01:10.259 --> 01:12.545
I will destroy you.

01:12.808 --> 01:16.437
I've never felt like this before. I don't know what to do.

01:16.732 --> 01:17.748
It's okay to be scared.

01:19.069 --> 01:21.645
There's no place in the world for you anymore.

01:22.997 --> 01:24.633
I wouldn't count us out just yet.

01:26.830 --> 01:28.556
The Legend of Korra.
