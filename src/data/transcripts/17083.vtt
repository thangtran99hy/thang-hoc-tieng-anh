William Shakespeare, some say the greatest writer ever.

00:04.105 --> 00:08.076
He was born in 1564 to John Shakespeare and Mary Arden.

00:08.518 --> 00:11.691
His father made gloves for a living and his mother once worked on a farm.

00:12.495 --> 00:18.629
He lived in an English town named Stratford-upon-Avon where he went to school, we think, until the age of 13...

00:19.057 --> 00:23.597
...when his father's poor financial standing made it no longer possible for him to attend.

00:24.382 --> 00:28.933
In 1582, he married Anne Hathaway, who also used to be a farmer.

00:29.393 --> 00:32.590
At the time of their marriage, she was already several months pregnant.

00:33.393 --> 00:38.217
Together they had a daughter, Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith.
