00:02.645 --> 00:06.471
72 floors up with London laid out before them.

00:06.774 --> 00:11.954
A breathtaking, terrifying view from the top of the Shard, the highest building in Europe.

00:12.559 --> 00:15.869
The group who took this video call themselves the Urban Explorers.

00:16.270 --> 00:18.634
They say they do not set out to break the law,...

00:18.969 --> 00:25.910
...but their latest stunt has exposed an embarrassing security breach a few months before the Olympic Games open in London.

00:26.667 --> 00:31.296
David Rubens runs a security consulting firm specializing in the Olympics.

00:31.437 --> 00:35.531
The security managers, that's the sort of thing they should be managing.

00:35.627 --> 00:37.067
The Olympics is a wild problem.

00:37.615 --> 00:38.334
It's a wicked problem.

00:38.421 --> 00:39.339
It's out of control.

00:39.882 --> 00:43.273
But looking after your own building is something that security managers should be able to do nowadays.

00:43.894 --> 00:49.185
Several similar groups are now claiming they also illegally scaled the Shard in recent months.

00:49.629 --> 00:54.749
The revelation comes just a week after a major sporting event in London was disrupted.

00:55.259 --> 00:57.435
For the first time since the World Wars,..

00:57.705 --> 01:00.717
... a protester halted the rowing race along the River Thames...

01:01.035 --> 01:03.267
...between Oxford and Cambridge universities.

01:03.741 --> 01:09.423
Trenton Oldfield appeared suddenly in front of Oxford's boat, forcing the race to be restarted.

01:09.895 --> 01:13.878
Oldfield says it was a protest against what he called "elitist society."

01:14.610 --> 01:18.528
Olympic gold medalist Sir Matthew Pinsent was one of the race umpires.

01:18.895 --> 01:22.856
I think, any race official, your first priority is safety,...

01:23.305 --> 01:25.459
...both for the competitors and the public at large.

01:25.989 --> 01:30.242
And as soon as it was obvious to us that there was a guy swimming in the water,...

01:30.878 --> 01:33.283
...then it's no choice, you stop the race.

01:34.213 --> 01:38.094
The stunt prompted the chief of the British Olympic Association...

01:38.211 --> 01:42.642
... to warn that it would take "just one idiot," in his words, to ruin this summer's Olympics.

01:43.155 --> 01:45.567
Again, security consultant David Rubens.

01:46.111 --> 01:48.841
First of all, it's very hard to guard against, as we saw with the boat race.

01:49.804 --> 01:53.977
Secondly, we have a history of what's called "protest by banner waving" in the UK,...

01:54.915 --> 01:58.604
...where very low-key, low-tech, low-cost groups...

01:58.689 --> 02:03.095
...such as the Animal Liberation Front, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,...

02:03.193 --> 02:05.441
...Greenpeace and especially Fathers 4 Justice...

02:06.321 --> 02:11.493
...gain massive international coverage through very low-tech and low-cost operations.

02:12.778 --> 02:17.436
Security rehearsals have focused on potential large-scale terror attacks.

02:17.805 --> 02:24.291
The cost of security alone has doubled since the original estimate to 882 million dollars.

02:24.953 --> 02:27.605
But as authorities make their final preparations...

02:27.898 --> 02:30.544
...for Britain's biggest peacetime security operation,...

02:30.944 --> 02:36.493
...there's a growing fear that just one determined individual could cause widespread disruption.

02:37.175 --> 02:39.279
