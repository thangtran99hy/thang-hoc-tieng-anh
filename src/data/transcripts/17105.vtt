I'm Tom Stewart, Editor and Managing Director of the Harvard Business Review.

00:14.224 --> 00:19.618
Our guest today is Michael Porter, Professor at Harvard University and Head of the Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness.

00:20.112 --> 00:25.474
He is the author of the forthcoming HBR article "The Five Competitive Forces that Shape Strategy,"...

00:25.853 --> 00:33.588
...a reaffirmation, update and extension of his groundbreaking 1979 article "How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy."

00:34.106 --> 00:41.946
Mike, thanks for joining the program. To start, let's remind our viewers of what the five competitive forces are.

00:42.965 --> 00:48.942
Well Tom, the basic idea that competitive forces starts with the notion that competition...

00:49.449 --> 00:56.554
...is often look at too narrowly by managers and the five forces say that, yes, you're competing with your direct competitors...

00:57.173 --> 01:02.794
...but you're also in a fight for profits with a broader, extended set of competitors,...

01:02.887 --> 01:06.536
...customers who have bargaining powers, suppliers who can have bargaining power,...

01:06.798 --> 01:09.893
...new entrants who might come in and kind of grab a piece of the action,...

01:10.253 --> 01:15.747
...and substitute products or services that essentially place a constraint or a cap on your profitability and growth.

01:16.196 --> 01:19.931
So, the five forces is kind of a holistic way of looking at any industry...

01:20.001 --> 01:24.707
...and understanding the structural underlying drivers of profitability and competence.

01:24.767 --> 01:31.887
So, I use this to think about my rival makes it difficult for me. The threat of substitutes means I can't overcharge,...

01:31.977 --> 01:34.257
...the threat of new entrants means I can't overcharge.

01:34.323 --> 01:34.523
Right.

01:34.726 --> 01:38.023
And the same thing with the buyers and suppliers.

01:38.111 --> 01:48.007
And there's underlying drivers of each of those forces that the model really sort of unveils and then you can actually apply this.

01:48.109 --> 01:52.569
Every industry is different, every industry will have a different set of economic fundamentals...

01:52.745 --> 01:58.047
...but five forces help you hone in on, first of all, what's really causing profitability in the industry.

01:58.391 --> 02:03.731
What are the trends that most likely to be significant in changing the game in the industry?

02:04.414 --> 02:10.692
You know, where are the constraints, which if you can relax, it might allow you to find a really strong competitive position?

02:10.986 --> 02:14.632
So how would you apply this analysis to an industry? Airlines, for example.

02:15.310 --> 02:24.561
Airlines is a great industry. You've seen in the article that there's a chart that compares profitability in industries...

02:24.653 --> 02:29.198
...and airlines I think has been on the bottom of that list for decades.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.923
It's among the least profitable industries known to man.

02:34.405 --> 02:40.519
And the five forces really allows you very quickly to understand why. I mean let's just go around the chart,...

02:41.313 --> 02:46.121
...the nature of rivalry is incredibly intense and it's almost exclusively on price.

02:46.425 --> 02:50.057
It's been very hard to differentiate, to get the customer to wait...

02:50.134 --> 02:55.339
...even an extra two or three minutes for another flight if they can get on the flight with a cheaper price.

02:55.393 --> 02:58.908
So, there's been a very intense price competition, low barriers to entry,...

02:59.203 --> 03:04.949
...a constant stream of new airlines coming in to the industry despite the fact that profitability is low, it's always puzzling.

03:05.157 --> 03:07.810
Low barriers to entry because you can rent a plane, you don't have to buy them.

03:08.297 --> 03:12.351
You can rent a plane, you can lease a gate, it's all generic technology.

03:13.223 --> 03:19.137
You can start with one flight between two city pairs. There's no real need to have a whole network in the beginning.

03:19.938 --> 03:22.701
And yet people keep coming in. I think it is just one of those "sexy" industries.

03:22.773 --> 03:29.986
It's a great example of how sexiness or coolness or hotness or chicness has nothing to do with industry profitability.

03:30.133 --> 03:33.225
The underlying structures is what drives profitability.

03:33.969 --> 03:36.921
Yeah, the customer is very fickle and price-sensitive.

03:37.113 --> 03:43.815
Suppliers of aircraft and aircraft engines and even aircraft gates at the airports now have a lot of clout.

03:43.900 --> 03:46.683
They can bargain away most of their profits.
