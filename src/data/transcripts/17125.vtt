Hi, I'm Bella Thorne and I've been bullied my whole life.

00:04.756 --> 00:08.313
It started when I was about five or six and it was before school...

00:08.651 --> 00:11.811
...because I spoke Spanish, that's my first language,...

00:11.980 --> 00:15.999
....and everybody called me weird because I didn't speak like everybody else.

00:16.094 --> 00:20.637
So, I completely dropped Spanish to fit in so that people would stop calling me names,...

00:20.757 --> 00:25.323
...and now I have to try to retake Spanish because I want to learn it.

00:25.918 --> 00:27.731
And that's the cause of bullying.

00:28.549 --> 00:31.281
Then it continued, just for something different.

00:32.193 --> 00:35.508
It was because I wasn't able to read as everybody else.

00:35.983 --> 00:37.849
People called me dumb and stupid.

00:38.537 --> 00:41.085
And now, to this very day,...

00:41.343 --> 00:44.468
...I get really nervous so that I can barely read in front of a large crowd.

00:45.468 --> 00:48.147
And that was because I was dyslexic.

00:49.112 --> 00:53.034
I'm taking a stand against bullying because it's wrong and hurtful,...

00:53.549 --> 00:55.850
...and it can harm everybody in different ways.

00:56.699 --> 00:57.599
Will you take one with me?
