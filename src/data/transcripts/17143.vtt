"Blue Ocean Strategy" is a business management book published in early 2005.

00:14.047 --> 00:21.213
The book is based upon a "Harvard Business Review" article authored by W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne.

00:23.537 --> 00:25.021
According to the book's website,...

00:25.693 --> 00:29.331
..."Blue Ocean Strategy" is a way to make the competition irrelevant...

00:29.745 --> 00:34.438
...by creating a leap in value for both the company and its customers.

00:36.324 --> 00:41.007
The authors divide the market universe into "Red Oceans" and "Blue Oceans".

00:42.465 --> 00:49.143
Red oceans represent "The Known", the company's markets and industries that exist today.

00:50.408 --> 00:54.199
Red oceans represent their defined and accepted limitations...

00:55.034 --> 01:01.099
...and the competitive nature they foster as they battle for control of perceived limited resources.

01:02.364 --> 01:07.785
This waging of corporate war turns the waters bloody, hence the term "Red Ocean".

01:09.636 --> 01:16.335
Blue oceans represent "The Unknown", the company's markets and industries not in existence.

01:17.757 --> 01:24.327
Within a blue ocean, unlimited opportunities to create markets and new demand await discovery.

01:25.304 --> 01:29.885
Because of the vast potential within these blue oceans, competition is irrelevant...

01:30.263 --> 01:34.036
...as the quote rules of the game have yet to be defined.

01:35.349 --> 01:40.091
Blue Ocean Strategy contrasts starkly with Red Ocean Strategy...

01:40.611 --> 01:44.348
...in that it seeks to escape from accepted market boundaries...

01:44.655 --> 01:48.071
...and create new markets in order to leave the competition behind.

01:49.791 --> 01:53.676
Value innovation is the core concept of the book's message.

01:54.698 --> 01:59.603
By ignoring the competition and focusing strategic thinking on the buyer,...

02:00.513 --> 02:05.156
...a leap in value results for both the company and its customers.

02:06.905 --> 02:11.846
Adopting this approach increases a company's chance of survival and growth...

02:12.460 --> 02:16.073
...in increasingly crowded and shrinking market spaces.

02:20.304 --> 02:24.603
The book has been described by many as required reading for business executives...

02:25.118 --> 02:32.869
...as it proposes six clearly defined principles they can use to create their own "Blue Ocean" strategies.
