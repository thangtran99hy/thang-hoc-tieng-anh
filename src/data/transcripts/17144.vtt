00:16.381 --> 00:21.797
Ten years ago, on a Tuesday morning, I conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

00:22.406 --> 00:27.359
It was a routine training jump, like many more I'd done since I became a paratrooper 27 years before.

00:28.465 --> 00:32.787
We went down to the airfield early because this is the Army and you always go early.

00:34.239 --> 00:38.107
You do some routine refresher training, and then you go to put on your parachute...

00:39.145 --> 00:39.963
... and a buddy helps you.

00:40.033 --> 00:41.321
And you put on the T-10 parachute.

00:41.409 --> 00:43.033
And you're very careful how you put the straps,...

00:43.129 --> 00:45.372
...particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs.

00:46.127 --> 00:48.546
And then you put on your reserve and then you put on your heavy rucksack.

00:48.640 --> 00:53.467
And then a jumpmaster comes and he's an experienced NCO in parachute operations.

00:53.796 --> 00:54.525
He checks you out.

00:54.598 --> 01:00.426
He grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your chest is crushed,...

01:00.517 --> 01:01.772
...your shoulders are crushed down. 

01:01.844 --> 01:05.615
And of course, he's tightened so your voice goes up a couple of octaves as well.

01:07.669 --> 01:10.522
Then you sit down and you wait a little while, because this is the Army.

01:11.475 --> 01:14.155
Then you load the aircraft, and then you stand up and you get on.

01:14.215 --> 01:17.395
And then you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this in a line of people.

01:17.456 --> 01:20.051
And you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft.

01:20.599 --> 01:23.924
And you wait a little bit longer, because this is the Air Force teaching the Army how to wait.

01:27.366 --> 01:28.291
Then you take off.

01:29.536 --> 01:32.198
And it's painful enough now, and I think it's designed this way,...

01:32.283 --> 01:33.941
...it's painful enough so you want to jump.

01:34.471 --> 01:36.195
You didn't really want to jump, but you want out.

01:37.147 --> 01:40.219
So you get in the aircraft, you're flying along, and at 20 minutes out,...

01:40.311 --> 01:41.960
...these jumpmasters start giving you commands.

01:42.039 --> 01:43.857
They give 20 minutes, that's a time warning.

01:44.428 --> 01:46.807
You sit there, okay. Then they give you ten minutes.

01:46.884 --> 01:49.177
And of course, you're responding with all of these.

01:49.246 --> 01:52.054
That's to boost everybody's confidence, to show that you're not scared.

01:52.814 --> 01:56.838
Then they give you, "Get ready." Then they go, "Outboard personnel, stand up."

01:58.117 --> 02:00.153
If you're an outboard personnel, you stand up.

02:00.445 --> 02:02.399
If you're an inboard personnel, stand up.

02:03.027 --> 02:05.897
And then you hook up, and you hook up your static line.

02:05.963 --> 02:09.336
And at that point you think, "Hey, guess what? I'm probably going to jump.

02:09.553 --> 02:11.059
"There's no way to get out of this at this point."

02:11.865 --> 02:14.990
You go through some additional checks and then they open the door.

02:15.057 --> 02:19.109
And this was that Tuesday morning in September and it was pretty nice outside.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.987
So nice air comes flowing in.

02:22.449 --> 02:24.369
The jumpmasters start to check the door.

02:25.812 --> 02:29.113
And then when it's time to go, a green light goes on. The jumpmaster goes, "Go."

02:29.187 --> 02:32.139
The first guy goes, and you're just in line, and you just kind of lumber to the door.

02:32.809 --> 02:34.545
Jump is a misnomer. You fall.

02:35.435 --> 02:38.434
You fall outside the door and you're caught in the slipstream.

02:38.525 --> 02:41.008
The first thing you do is you lock into a tight body position.

02:41.641 --> 02:45.973
Head down in your chest, your arms extended, put over your reserve parachute.

02:46.387 --> 02:52.127
You do that because, 27 years before, an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that.

02:52.789 --> 02:55.739
I have no idea whether it makes any difference, but he seemed to make sense,..

02:56.243 --> 02:59.188
...and I wasn't going to test the hypothesis that he'd be wrong.

03:01.379 --> 03:04.158
And then you wait for the opening shock for your parachute to open.

03:04.880 --> 03:08.375
If you don't get an opening shock to open the parachute, you've got a whole new problem set.

03:09.791 --> 03:12.035
But typically you do, typically it opens.

03:12.115 --> 03:17.553
And of course, if your leg straps aren't set right at that point, you get another little thrill.

03:18.057 --> 03:18.377
Boom.
