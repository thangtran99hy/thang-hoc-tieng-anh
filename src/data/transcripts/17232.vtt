You've probably heard the word engineering before...

00:03.301 --> 00:05.382
...and you've probably been told it's pretty important.

00:05.975 --> 00:07.886
But what exactly is engineering?

00:08.194 --> 00:10.071
And who exactly is an engineer?

00:10.733 --> 00:13.876
Engineers are people who design and build things that we use every day.

00:14.370 --> 00:17.443
However, they don't just go building the first thing that comes to mind.

00:17.841 --> 00:21.419
They work hard to make something we need and they want to do a good job of it.

00:21.871 --> 00:24.115
So how do engineers decide what they need to build?

00:24.709 --> 00:26.815
Well, in most cases, they start with a question.

00:27.402 --> 00:28.167
Here's an example.

00:28.605 --> 00:32.180
Say you live on a space station and something outside breaks.

00:32.729 --> 00:34.708
Obviously, you need to go outside and fix it.

00:35.051 --> 00:36.993
But how exactly do you do that?

00:37.505 --> 00:39.349
That's a great question for engineers.

00:40.837 --> 00:45.286
Once they've got a good handle on things, they'll start imagining ways to solve the problem.

00:45.882 --> 00:50.825
They'll come up with all kinds of ideas and some that might even seem a little crazy.

00:51.252 --> 00:55.910
That's important because sometimes the craziest idea is the one that works best.

00:56.303 --> 01:00.241
After coming up with these ideas, they'll pick a few that make the most sense.

01:01.057 --> 01:02.757
Next, they'll start drawing a plan.

01:03.142 --> 01:07.955
Depending on the idea, the plan can be very simple or very complicated.

01:08.382 --> 01:10.563
But the important part is the plan itself.

01:11.144 --> 01:15.957
A good plan helps engineers focus on what they're making and most importantly, why.
