Every day, the world consumes 300 tons of caffeine,...

00:03.995 --> 00:06.648
...enough for one cup of coffee for every man, woman and child.

00:07.364 --> 00:10.056
It takes about 40 coffee beans to make one shot of espresso.

00:11.375 --> 00:13.902
Poison though caffeine is, you do still develop an addiction to this stuff.

00:13.995 --> 00:17.160
And it's a real physiological addiction, not a wimpy psychological addiction...

00:17.255 --> 00:19.305
...like people claim for video games and the Internet.

00:19.934 --> 00:22.242
But caffeine isn't heroin, rapid withdrawal won't kill you.

00:22.533 --> 00:24.399
It might make you cranky and give you a wicked headache...

00:24.589 --> 00:27.784
...but since caffeine releases dopamine to make you happy and it gets rid of headaches,...

00:28.082 --> 00:29.887
...there's really no reason to ever stop using this stuff.

00:30.632 --> 00:34.605
Caffeine is the world's most used psychoactive drug and with good reason, it's pure awesome.

00:34.992 --> 00:38.036
It increases concentration, decreases fatigue and gives you better memory.

00:38.719 --> 00:41.841
And this isn't just a placebo, these are real effects replicable in a laboratory.

00:42.067 --> 00:46.218
And, contrary to popular belief, drinking coffee isn't a Faustian bargain where the Devil...

00:46.297 --> 00:49.237
...gives you the ability to work faster but in exchange, makes your life shorter.

00:49.847 --> 00:51.898
For normal, healthy humans, there are no medical concerns.

00:52.086 --> 00:54.650
Coffee and the caffeine within it may even have medical benefits...

00:54.708 --> 00:57.737
...such as protection from cardiovascular disease, diabetes and Parkinson's.

00:58.727 --> 01:00.045
Caffeine can even get rid of migraines,...

01:00.126 --> 01:03.341
...but the amount required and the method of ingestion is... uncomfortable.

01:04.325 --> 01:05.632
You know what else you can thank caffeine for?

01:05.761 --> 01:07.457
A little thing called the Enlightenment.

01:07.890 --> 01:10.651
In the 1600s, people drank more beer and gin than water.

01:11.045 --> 01:14.394
But with the introduction of coffee and tea, people switched from a depressant to a stimulant.

01:14.733 --> 01:18.419
It's not surprising then that this time was an intellectual boon compared to earlier centuries.

01:19.048 --> 01:22.961
Ben Franklin and Edward Lloyd loved their coffee for the same reason that modern workers and students do.

01:23.243 --> 01:26.598
It's invaluable for staying awake and concentrating when you need to finish a TPS report...

01:26.675 --> 01:28.137
...or to get through that boring physics class.

01:28.546 --> 01:29.767
Coffee is the fuel of the modern world...

01:29.885 --> 01:32.755
...so go grab a cup guilt-free and get working smarter and faster.
