00:01.796 --> 00:02.829
You didn't see that coming.

00:03.547 --> 00:08.579
In "Where the Wild Things Are," Max is a hyperactive boy...

00:09.009 --> 00:12.609
...with an imaginary world inhabited by wild monsters.

00:12.990 --> 00:18.473
Maurice Sendak created this wild children's book, which became a movie in 2009.

00:19.031 --> 00:22.147
"Where the Wild Things Are" is his most famous creation.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.920
We can totally build a place like that.

00:24.169 --> 00:26.629
At a New York exhibit of his illustrations,...

00:26.748 --> 00:30.172
...this is what the curator had to say about Sendak's work.

00:30.354 --> 00:33.771
Maurice Sendak, I think, to the world, has made such a huge impression...

00:34.161 --> 00:36.977
...with his illustration and his technique and his stories.

00:37.285 --> 00:39.045
It is always a story within the story.

00:40.992 --> 00:45.509
Once you read one of his stories and you really understand beyond being a child,...

00:45.922 --> 00:49.835
...as an adult looking back, you can really understand what the story is really about.

00:52.799 --> 00:55.273
In "The Wild Things," Max misbehaves.

00:55.618 --> 00:59.175
He escapes into a world where he leads a wild rumpus.

00:59.311 --> 01:01.925
Let the wild rumpus start.

01:02.407 --> 01:07.711
For over 50 years, Sendak wrote and illustrated books focusing on kids' fears,...

01:07.828 --> 01:09.730
...insecurities and complexes.

01:10.184 --> 01:13.747
"Where the Wild Things Are," first published in 1963,...

01:14.038 --> 01:18.794
...changed the image of kids in literature as well-scrubbed and well-behaved.

01:19.413 --> 01:24.026
Throughout his life, Sendak refused to be regarded as a children's writer.

01:24.431 --> 01:29.992
He said he wrote about the human condition and he refused to give in...

01:30.258 --> 01:32.498
...to popular trends like e-books.

01:32.961 --> 01:38.759
Earlier this year, in one of his last TV interviews, he told Comedy Central's Stephen Colbert,...

01:39.479 --> 01:45.342
..."I hate those e-books. They cannot be the future. They may well be, I will be dead."

01:45.455 --> 01:51.711
Sendak's art went beyond books. In the second half of his career, he designed theatrical sets.

01:52.315 --> 01:57.712
But one of his happiest moments was when "The Wild Things Are" came out as a movie.

01:57.833 --> 01:59.194
It feels very strange.

01:59.855 --> 02:02.269
This whole procedure is very strange.

02:02.883 --> 02:04.177
I don't believe it's happening. 

02:04.264 --> 02:05.641
This is a dream, right?

02:08.789 --> 02:09.215
78.

02:09.514 --> 02:13.811
Maurice Sendak will always be remembered for Max and his monsters.

02:14.362 --> 02:20.861
He showed how the inner world of even the most frail is inhabited by wild things.
