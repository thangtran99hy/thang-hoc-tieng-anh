In today's installment of "America's Jobs," three small business success stories.

00:09.554 --> 00:13.241
Three women taking control of their careers before the rough economy did it for them.

00:13.715 --> 00:16.915
Now, they're living their dreams as business owners doing work they love.

00:17.247 --> 00:21.331
And our workplace contributor Tory Johnson is here to tell us how they did it and how you can too.

00:21.392 --> 00:25.019
Good to have you back, Tory. And you know, for most people, once they get that idea...

00:25.163 --> 00:28.351
...and figure out what they want the business to be, the big obstacle is money.

00:28.519 --> 00:30.943
Money. I don't have any money, I can't possibly do it.

00:31.011 --> 00:33.561
And these three women showed that yes, you can do it.

00:33.857 --> 00:37.132
A little bit of encouraging news was that for the first five months of this year,...

00:37.201 --> 00:43.035
...the SBA says that they backed more than 4,000 loans totaling more than 11 billion dollars.

00:43.107 --> 00:48.277
So, we're starting to see that some money is out there and that brings us good luck and good news.

00:49.528 --> 00:52.970
Small loans to Vivian Tenorio, for example.

00:53.347 --> 00:57.299
Exactly a year ago, she was working as a software installer...

00:57.385 --> 01:00.224
...and she saw that the work orders were slowing down in her company.

01:00.539 --> 01:03.807
And she started to think, "I need a plan B in case I get a pink slip."

01:04.097 --> 01:07.683
Realizing, of course, "I can't do without a paycheck. What would I do in the event?"

01:07.988 --> 01:12.765
And so, she decided to start dabbling with a family recipe of flan.

01:13.101 --> 01:16.796
And people said, "Oh, you can't really build a business out of that dessert. It's not going to work."

01:16.871 --> 01:18.191
And she said, "Watch me."

01:18.527 --> 01:24.004
And she started cooking up little batches, sampling it in different areas around where she lived.

01:24.147 --> 01:27.497
And the orders started coming in and she realized, "I might be onto something."

01:27.773 --> 01:31.473
She packed up her car, drove to the Austin headquarters of Whole Foods,...

01:31.559 --> 01:33.712
...dropped off some samples and begged the receptionist...

01:33.781 --> 01:36.511
...to make sure that a buyer was able to get that package.

01:36.815 --> 01:38.619
The next day, they called and placed an order.

01:38.885 --> 01:42.325
She's now in a hundred Whole Foods stores as well as others.

01:42.549 --> 01:43.927
Oh, it must be a very good flan.

01:43.997 --> 01:44.742
Really good flan.

01:44.831 --> 01:46.863
You know what, it got a thumbs-up around here. 

01:46.953 --> 01:48.667
Two double thumbs-up around here.

01:49.039 --> 01:52.233
And what she realized then was that she needed some money to really grow.

01:52.490 --> 01:56.683
She applied for and got a 15,000 dollar loan, that's all she needed,...

01:57.030 --> 02:01.492
...and she's now projecting retail sales for this year of 250,000 dollars.

02:01.581 --> 02:04.303
That is really something.  So, what is the biggest lesson you learned from Vivian?

02:04.376 --> 02:05.549
For her, there are two of them.

02:05.839 --> 02:08.475
So, one is get friendly with your bankers.

02:08.567 --> 02:12.153
Know what the bank wants before you just go in and ask for the money.

02:12.724 --> 02:14.633
All of us can go into our banks and talk to people.

02:14.709 --> 02:18.423
Go into other banks in your area and talk about what they're looking for when lending.

02:18.719 --> 02:20.747
And also, try before you buy.

02:20.807 --> 02:24.902
So, a lot of times people think that, "I'm going to need all of this expensive equipment."

02:24.981 --> 02:28.256
One of the best tips Vivian says is for someone who wants to start a food business...

02:28.329 --> 02:30.274
...and probably can't do it in their home:...

02:30.545 --> 02:34.487
Look for commercial kitchen space. Maybe even by calling a church and saying,...

02:34.548 --> 02:37.835
..."You know what, can I just rent it off hours when you're not using that kitchen?"

02:38.158 --> 02:42.505
So, try things out before you invest in expensive technology or before you sign leases.
