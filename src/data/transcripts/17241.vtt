00:01.955 --> 00:02.934
You wanna make it happen?

00:05.455 --> 00:06.857
Life is short, let's do this.

00:07.374 --> 00:10.627
Your mantra of choice is this: I'll figure it out.

00:10.790 --> 00:12.272
You will figure it out.

00:12.362 --> 00:14.173
You need to strike this from your vocabulary:...

00:14.255 --> 00:15.012
...I don't know what to do.

00:15.124 --> 00:15.773
You'll figure it out.

00:15.942 --> 00:21.183
Remember this: everything you have ever done in your entire life, in the history of humanity,...

00:21.359 --> 00:22.965
...has brought you to this point.

00:23.144 --> 00:26.289
The first kiss, a blank page, white space.

00:27.217 --> 00:31.291
A beginner's mind is an open mind, and an open mind innovates.

00:31.711 --> 00:32.856
Respect your fear.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.971
It's part of the creative process and it keeps you alert.

00:36.325 --> 00:38.381
What are you gonna give up to get where you wanna go?

00:38.463 --> 00:39.760
Because you can't have it all.

00:40.023 --> 00:41.152
Aim for passion.

00:41.269 --> 00:42.946
Balance? It's a myth.

00:43.061 --> 00:44.183
Tell us your dream.

00:44.453 --> 00:48.300
When you declare it and share it, you're accountable and you're helpable.

00:48.692 --> 00:52.013
Every masterpiece that's ever been done? It could've been better.

00:52.298 --> 00:55.540
The universe is always expanding and that includes you.

00:55.732 --> 00:56.837
You wanna make it happen?

00:57.006 --> 00:58.286
Do what you say you're gonna do.

00:58.765 --> 01:01.071
Keep it pointed to where you want it to go.

01:01.311 --> 01:05.783
Every day, today, now, do a little more of what you really wanna be doing...

01:05.873 --> 01:11.181
...and do a little less of what you don't want to do, until your ideal becomes what's real.

01:11.320 --> 01:12.653
You can make it happen.
