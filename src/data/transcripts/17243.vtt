00:02.801 --> 00:04.787
The road show started in New York,...

00:04.906 --> 00:10.909
...with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg on a mission to convince as many investors to like Facebook.

00:11.290 --> 00:14.883
Even from very early on when we're just building this thing for one school,...

00:15.201 --> 00:16.848
...there was this concept of what it could turn into.

00:16.925 --> 00:19.520
We just weren't sure then that we would be the ones who did it.

00:19.919 --> 00:24.898
Few could've imagined that what started as a university dormitory project just eight years ago...

00:25.121 --> 00:31.785
...would attract 900 million users worldwide and have an estimated value equal to the GDP of a small country.

00:32.218 --> 00:36.228
Based on an initial asking price of 28 to 35 dollars per share,...

00:36.520 --> 00:41.207
...stock analyst Max Wolf says the company may be worth upwards of 80 billion.

00:41.659 --> 00:44.763
I think we all get the valuation, I think they'll probably trade up on the first day.

00:45.125 --> 00:48.777
That being said, they're trying to take as much money in their IPO as possible.

00:49.119 --> 00:52.674
But not everyone is convinced of Facebook's money-making potential.

00:53.237 --> 00:54.225
I would not invest in it.

00:54.513 --> 00:58.218
Jeff Corbin, CEO at KCSA Strategic Communications,...

00:58.449 --> 01:01.145
...tells VOA that based on its advertising revenue,...

01:01.466 --> 01:03.730
...the company is worth considerably less.

01:04.101 --> 01:10.065
He uses the valuation formula for Google which is roughly five and a half times its annual advertising revenue.

01:10.591 --> 01:18.875
So if you use that multiple and you apply it to Facebook on say, 400 million in revenue,...

01:18.949 --> 01:25.625
...multiply that by 5.5. Maybe you have a 20 to 25 billion dollar valuation.

01:25.814 --> 01:28.407
Surely not a $100,000,000,000 valuation.

01:28.909 --> 01:31.697
Max Wolf admits the current valuation is aggressive.

01:32.039 --> 01:34.077
But he believes Facebook has momentum.

01:34.434 --> 01:36.127
The bigger you are, the harder it is to grow.

01:36.523 --> 01:40.967
That being said, we still think the company is a growth story. Clearly, the market does too.

01:41.230 --> 01:46.311
That may be so. But for now, Corbin tells casual investors to steer clear from the hype.

01:46.959 --> 01:52.242
What I feel is almost certain to happen is, unless the company gives specific metrics...

01:52.891 --> 01:56.965
...and indicates how they're going to increase those metrics,...

01:57.293 --> 01:59.717
...every quarter will be a disappointment for the company.

02:00.424 --> 02:07.009
Facebook's road show is sure to answer similar investor concerns as it crisscrosses major cities across the U.S..

02:07.521 --> 02:12.989
Facebook is expected to officially debut in the New York's Stock Exchange as early as May 18th.

02:13.568 --> 02:16.449
