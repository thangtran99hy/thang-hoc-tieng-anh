00:17.244 --> 00:19.619
Good morning. How are you?

00:21.451 --> 00:22.208
It's been great, hasn't it?

00:24.148 --> 00:25.698
I've been blown away by the whole thing.

00:26.070 --> 00:26.951
In fact, I'm leaving.

00:33.354 --> 00:36.200
There have been three themes, haven't there, running through the conference,...

00:37.008 --> 00:38.960
...which are relevant to what I want to talk about.

00:39.051 --> 00:43.115
One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity...

00:43.831 --> 00:47.254
...in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here.

00:48.324 --> 00:50.607
Just the variety of it and the range of it.

00:51.710 --> 00:55.298
The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen,...

00:56.397 --> 00:57.220
...in terms of the future.

00:57.637 --> 00:59.831
No idea how this may play out.

01:00.663 --> 01:02.019
I have an interest in education.

01:02.515 --> 01:06.219
Actually, what I find is everybody has an interest in education.

01:06.726 --> 01:07.164
Don't you?

01:08.053 --> 01:08.708
I find this very interesting. 

01:08.773 --> 01:12.471
If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education,...

01:13.437 --> 01:15.685
...actually you're not often at dinner parties, frankly,...

01:20.119 --> 01:21.683
....if you work in education, you're not asked.

01:25.689 --> 01:29.041
And you're never asked back, curiously. That's strange to me.

01:29.673 --> 01:32.335
But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say,...

01:32.413 --> 01:34.502
..."What do you do?" and you say you work in education,...

01:34.637 --> 01:36.563
...you can see the blood run from their face.

01:36.651 --> 01:38.024
They're like, "Oh my God," you know, "Why me?"

01:41.453 --> 01:42.594
"My one night out all week."

01:45.800 --> 01:48.219
But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall.

01:48.989 --> 01:51.569
Because it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right,...

01:52.077 --> 01:55.288
...like religion, and money and other things.

01:57.845 --> 02:00.151
I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do.

02:00.491 --> 02:03.863
We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education...

02:03.930 --> 02:06.280
...that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp.

02:07.225 --> 02:14.085
If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065.

02:15.675 --> 02:20.298
Nobody has a clue despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days,...

02:20.920 --> 02:25.054
...what the world will look like in five years time. And yet we're meant to be educating them for it.

02:25.577 --> 02:27.729
So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary.

02:28.203 --> 02:31.191
And the third part of this is that we've all agreed, nonetheless,...

02:31.726 --> 02:38.713
...on the really extraordinary capacities that children have, their capacities for innovation.

02:39.393 --> 02:43.473
I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she, just seeing what she could do.

02:43.851 --> 02:48.922
And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak,...

02:49.383 --> 02:51.845
...exceptional in the whole of childhood.

02:52.392 --> 02:55.153
What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent.

02:55.966 --> 02:58.159
And my contention is all kids have tremendous talents...

02:58.251 --> 03:00.677
...and we squander them pretty ruthlessly.

03:02.003 --> 03:04.946
So, I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity.

03:05.259 --> 03:10.510
My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy,...

03:11.348 --> 03:13.772
...and we should treat it with the same status.
