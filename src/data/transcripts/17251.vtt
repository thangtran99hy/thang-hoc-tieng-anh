00:16.955 --> 00:23.622
I was here four years ago and I remember at the time that the talks weren't put online.

00:23.695 --> 00:31.141
And I think they were given to TEDsters in a box, a boxed set of DVDs, which they put on their shelves, where they are now.

00:34.753 --> 00:38.039
And actually, Chris called me a week after I'd given my talk and said,...

00:38.506 --> 00:40.683
..."We're going to start putting them online. Can we put yours online?"

00:40.747 --> 00:41.451
And I said, "Sure."

00:43.495 --> 00:50.223
And four years later, as he said, it has been seen by four, well, it has been downloaded four million times.

00:51.151 --> 00:55.369
So I suppose you could multiply that by 20 or something to get the number of people who've seen it.

00:55.443 --> 00:59.997
And, as Chris says, there is a hunger for videos of me.

01:09.493 --> 01:09.970
Don't you feel it?

01:15.108 --> 01:20.475
So, this whole event has been an elaborate buildup to me doing another one for you, so here it is.

01:25.497 --> 01:32.827
Al Gore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago and talked about the climate crisis,...

01:32.909 --> 01:36.021
...and I referenced that at the end of my last talk.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.629
So I want to pick up from there because I only had 18 minutes, frankly.

01:41.979 --> 01:42.791
So, as I was saying,...

01:52.680 --> 01:53.336
...you see, he's right.

01:53.535 --> 01:58.494
I mean, there is a major climate crisis, obviously, and I think if people don't believe it, they should get out more.

02:03.101 --> 02:14.509
But I believe there's a second climate crisis, which is as severe, which has the same origins, and that we have to deal with with the same urgency.

02:15.361 --> 02:17.937
And I mean by this, and you may say, by the way, "Look, I'm good."

02:19.214 --> 02:21.863
"I have one climate crisis, I don't really need a second one."

02:23.763 --> 02:30.170
But this is a crisis of, not natural resources, though I believe that's true, but a crisis of human resources.

02:30.950 --> 02:39.276
I believe fundamentally, as many speakers have said during the past few days, that we make very poor use of our talents.

02:40.197 --> 02:47.297
Very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be or if they have any to speak of.

02:48.060 --> 02:51.778
I meet all kinds of people who don't think they're really good at anything.

02:52.552 --> 02:56.162
Actually, I kind of divide the world into two groups now.

02:56.910 --> 03:01.278
Jeremy Bentham, the great utilitarian philosopher, once spiked this argument.

03:01.342 --> 03:06.854
You know he said, "There are two types of people in this world: those who divide the world into two types and those who do not."

03:13.007 --> 03:13.659
Well, I do.

03:19.823 --> 03:24.471
I meet all kinds of people who don't enjoy what they do.

03:24.613 --> 03:27.292
They simply go through their lives getting on with it.

03:28.301 --> 03:30.366
They get no great pleasure from what they do.

03:30.596 --> 03:35.062
They endure it rather than enjoy it and wait for the weekend.

03:36.455 --> 03:42.195
But I also meet people who love what they do and couldn't imagine doing anything else.

03:42.283 --> 03:44.944
So if you said to them, "Don't do this anymore," they'd wonder what you were talking about.

03:45.638 --> 03:47.271
Because it isn't what they do, it's who they are.

03:47.943 --> 03:53.855
They say, "But this is me. It would be foolish for me to abandon this, because it speaks to my most authentic self."

03:54.864 --> 03:57.300
And it's not true of enough people.

03:58.018 --> 04:00.813
In fact, on the contrary, I think it's still true of a minority of people.

04:02.004 --> 04:05.077
And I think there are many possible explanations for it.

04:05.740 --> 04:15.558
And high among them is education, because education, in a way, dislocates very many people from their natural talents.

04:16.223 --> 04:20.243
And human resources are like natural resources, they're often buried deep.

04:20.995 --> 04:24.300
You have to go looking for them. They're not just lying around on the surface.

04:24.585 --> 04:27.300
You have to create the circumstances where they show themselves.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.867
And you might imagine education would be the way that happens, but too often it's not.

04:33.915 --> 04:38.829
Every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment and it's not enough.

04:39.411 --> 04:44.571
Reform is no use anymore, because that's simply improving a broken model.

04:45.481 --> 04:53.565
What we need, and the word has been used many times during the course of the past few days, is not evolution, but a revolution in education.

04:54.035 --> 04:56.931
This has to be transformed into something else.
