00:01.184 --> 00:03.759
President Obama's dramatic announcement,...

00:03.931 --> 00:06.592
I think same-sex couples should be able to get married.

00:07.191 --> 00:10.697
...elicited a decidedly mixed reaction at the capital.

00:11.123 --> 00:15.198
House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi had nothing but praise.

00:15.567 --> 00:20.122
Yesterday was quite historic for all of us.

00:20.780 --> 00:29.508
America's children and families and workers saw history being made right before their very eyes;...

00:30.165 --> 00:36.439
...the President of the United States advancing civil rights in our country.

00:37.031 --> 00:42.964
Republican lawmakers derided the President's comments as the wrong message at the wrong time.

00:43.170 --> 00:44.763
House Speaker John Boehner...

00:44.954 --> 00:48.184
...I believe that marriage is the union of one man and one woman.

00:48.976 --> 00:53.101
And the President, the Democrats, can talk about all of this all they want.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.841
But the fact is, the American people are focused on our economy, and are asking the question, "Where are the jobs?"

01:00.449 --> 01:04.555
Opposition to gay rights is often expressed in religious terms.

01:04.784 --> 01:11.095
But representative Pelosi, a Roman Catholic, says her faith leads her to a different conclusion.

01:11.198 --> 01:19.928
My religion compels me and I love it for it to be against discrimination of any kind in our country.

01:20.570 --> 01:24.101
In the Senate, Republicans were mostly silent on the issue.

01:24.252 --> 01:29.842
Minority leader Mitch McConnell stressed the need to create jobs and spur economic growth.

01:30.379 --> 01:35.136
Democratic senator Jack Reed issued a statement endorsing same-sex marriage.

01:35.423 --> 01:41.917
Another Democrat, majority leader Harry Reed indicated he would support legalizing same-sex marriage...

01:42.171 --> 01:45.876
...if the issue were put to voters in his home state of Nevada.

01:46.250 --> 01:53.065
Reed also predicted this year's Democratic party platform will back marriage rights for gays and lesbians.

01:53.554 --> 01:58.369
Meanwhile, President Obama's reelection campaign issued an advertisement...

01:58.449 --> 02:04.862
...pointing out presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's opposition to same-sex marriage.

02:04.951 --> 02:09.083
I do not favor marriage between people of the same gender.

02:09.351 --> 02:15.192
The Obama campaign ad lists benefits and opportunities currently denied to gay couples.

02:15.459 --> 02:23.048
Obama campaign officials say financial donations from gays and lesbians have skyrocketed since the president's announcement.

02:23.505 --> 02:26.059
