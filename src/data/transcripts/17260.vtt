He used to think that for gay and lesbian couples, civil unions would suffice.

00:07.718 --> 00:11.081
But now, President Obama has concluded that's not enough.

00:11.342 --> 00:16.651
In an ABC News interview, he became the first president ever to support gay marriage.

00:17.136 --> 00:23.173
For me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm...

00:23.723 --> 00:27.485
...that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married.

00:27.629 --> 00:32.642
For gay rights groups, those words were history making and a tectonic cultural shift,...

00:32.986 --> 00:36.458
...but opponents warned Obama's trespassing on religious belief...

00:36.556 --> 00:38.867
...and undermining marriage as an institution.

00:39.076 --> 00:42.326
Same-sex couples are free to live together...

00:42.563 --> 00:44.650
...and there are many things that they can do...

00:44.760 --> 00:48.945
...to protect themselves financially and so forth...

00:49.043 --> 00:50.772
...through private contractual arrangements.

00:50.878 --> 00:56.460
Obama's decision sets up a clear electoral choice with Mitt Romney opposing gay marriage.

00:56.730 --> 01:00.877
But my view is that marriage itself is a relationship between a man and a woman...

01:01.007 --> 01:02.879
...and that's my own preference.

01:02.964 --> 01:04.867
I know other people have differing views.

01:04.984 --> 01:07.631
This is a very tender and sensitive topic.

01:07.741 --> 01:12.863
Indeed, Obama came to his view after more than a year of very public soul searching.

01:13.081 --> 01:16.376
You know, my feelings about this are constantly evolving.

01:16.467 --> 01:17.292
I struggle with this.

01:17.530 --> 01:20.629
He also made his move days after Vice President Biden...

01:20.719 --> 01:23.553
...told a news show he was comfortable with gay marriage.

01:23.834 --> 01:28.199
And in the interview, Obama described long talks with friends, allies and aides,...

01:28.294 --> 01:29.339
...some of whom are gay,...

01:29.642 --> 01:32.809
...and even his daughters who have friends with gay parents.

01:33.269 --> 01:36.603
Malia and Sacha, it wouldn't dawn on them that somehow,...

01:37.270 --> 01:40.320
...their friends' parents would be treated differently.

01:40.467 --> 01:42.665
It doesn't make sense to them and frankly,...

01:44.121 --> 01:48.935
...that's the kind of thing that prompts a change of perspective.

01:49.271 --> 01:54.930
Left unspoken, the political consequences which could be serious in some swing states.

01:55.103 --> 02:00.086
North Carolinians, by a large margin, approved the constitutional ban on gay marriage.

02:00.170 --> 02:03.041
Now, will those voters also come out in November...

02:03.124 --> 02:06.057
...and vote heavily against Obama, that's one question.

02:06.171 --> 02:09.553
Second question is, were they already gonna come out and vote against Obama anyway.

02:09.745 --> 02:13.945
Still, Obama also could gain by re-energizing a gay community...

02:14.021 --> 02:16.906
...that's campaigned for him and donated generously,...

02:17.129 --> 02:19.696
...but was growing increasingly impatient.

02:20.093 --> 02:21.287
Of course, the president's aides...

02:21.371 --> 02:24.690
...are stressing the personal nature of his deliberation on this issue...

02:24.801 --> 02:27.481
...as well as the faith that he says informed it.

02:27.734 --> 02:30.407
However, the political dimension is inescapable,...

02:30.616 --> 02:35.231
...and Obama's backers know better than anyone that it is a gamble.

02:35.629 --> 02:38.765
