00:00.223 --> 00:01.703
I take it you already know...

00:01.780 --> 00:04.409
...of tough and bough and cough and dough.

00:04.997 --> 00:06.817
Others may stumble, but not you,...

00:06.949 --> 00:09.306
...on hiccough, thorough, slough and through.

00:10.185 --> 00:10.999
Well done!

00:11.389 --> 00:12.719
And now you wish, perhaps,...

00:12.799 --> 00:14.513
...to learn of less familiar traps.

00:15.297 --> 00:17.635
Beware of heard, a dreadful word...

00:17.859 --> 00:20.572
...that looks like beard and sounds like bird.

00:21.440 --> 00:24.215
And dead, it's said like bed, not bead.

00:24.417 --> 00:26.471
For goodness' sake, don't call it deed!

00:27.300 --> 00:30.106
Watch out for meat and great and threat.

00:30.287 --> 00:33.537
They rhyme with suite and straight and debt.

00:34.437 --> 00:36.307
A moth is not a moth in mother,...

00:36.443 --> 00:38.852
...nor both in bother, broth or brother.

00:39.276 --> 00:41.235
And here is not a match for there,...

00:41.521 --> 00:44.249
...nor dear and fear for bear and pear.

00:44.773 --> 00:47.471
And then, there's doze and rose and lose.

00:47.701 --> 00:50.113
Just look them up and goose and choose.

00:50.613 --> 00:53.573
And cork and work and card and ward.

00:53.666 --> 00:56.615
And font and front and word and sword.

00:56.943 --> 00:59.483
And do and go, and thwart and cart.

00:59.798 --> 01:01.408
Come, I've hardly made a start.

01:02.019 --> 01:03.139
A dreadful language?

01:03.607 --> 01:06.643
Man alive, I'd learned to speak it when I was five!

01:07.483 --> 01:10.116
And yet to write it, the more I sigh.

01:10.575 --> 01:13.233
I'll not learn how till the day I die.
