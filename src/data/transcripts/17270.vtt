00:00.723 --> 00:04.524
My first piece of advice is this. Don't just get involved.

00:05.725 --> 00:07.203
Fight for your seat at the table.

00:08.150 --> 00:11.575
Better yet, fight for a seat at the head of the table.

00:21.868 --> 00:25.425
It's been said that the most important role in our democracy is the role of citizen.

00:26.499 --> 00:29.961
And indeed, it was 225 years ago today that...

00:30.427 --> 00:33.602
...the Constitutional Convention opened in Philadelphia and our founders,...

00:34.646 --> 00:39.051
...citizens all, began crafting an extraordinary document.

00:41.445 --> 00:47.888
Yes, it had its flaws. Flaws that this nation has strived to protect over time.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.869
Questions of race and gender were unresolved.

00:53.133 --> 00:57.232
No women's signature graced the original document. Although we can assume...

00:57.413 --> 01:01.977
...that there were founding mothers whispering smarter things in the ears of the founding fathers.

01:04.928 --> 01:05.780
That's almost certain.

01:09.059 --> 01:14.091
What made this document special was that it provided the space,...

01:14.190 --> 01:19.389
... the possibility for those who had been left out of our charter to fight their way in.

01:22.491 --> 01:29.168
It provided people the language to appeal to principles and ideals that broadened democracy's reach.

01:31.147 --> 01:36.281
It allowed for protest and movements, and the dissemination of new ideas...

01:36.367 --> 01:40.589
...that would repeatedly, decade after decade, change the world.

01:40.817 --> 01:44.809
A constant forward movement that continues to this day.

01:46.866 --> 01:53.321
Our founders understood that America does not stand still. We are dynamic, not static.

01:54.300 --> 01:56.245
We look forward, not back.

01:57.975 --> 02:01.250
And now that new doors have been opened for you,...

02:02.177 --> 02:05.761
...you've got an obligation to seize those opportunities.

02:08.312 --> 02:17.548
You need to do this not just for yourself but for those who don't yet enjoy the choices that you've had. The choices you will have.

02:19.393 --> 02:23.941
Don't wait for the person next to you to be the first to speak up for what's right.

02:24.895 --> 02:28.659
Because maybe, just maybe, they're waiting on you.

02:30.736 --> 02:35.693
Which brings me to my second piece of advice. Never underestimate the power of your example.

02:38.045 --> 02:39.527
The very fact that you are graduating,...

02:39.657 --> 02:42.744
... let alone that more women now graduate from college than men,...

02:43.344 --> 02:46.335
...is only possible because earlier generations of women -...

02:47.377 --> 02:49.443
...your mothers, your grandmothers, your aunts,...

02:50.347 --> 02:54.414
...shattered the myth that you couldn't or shouldn't be where you are.

02:57.181 --> 02:59.300
Do not underestimate the power of your example.

03:00.773 --> 03:08.258
This diploma opens up new possibilities. So reach back. Convince a young girl to earn one, too.

03:10.069 --> 03:13.536
If you earned your degree in an area where we need more women,...

03:13.879 --> 03:15.274
... like computer science or engineering,...

03:18.527 --> 03:21.454
...reach back and persuade another student to study it, too.

03:22.811 --> 03:24.661
If you're going into fields where we need more women,...

03:24.755 --> 03:27.319
... like construction or computer engineering, reach back. 

03:28.021 --> 03:28.982
Hire someone new.

03:30.185 --> 03:32.585
Be a mentor. Be a role model.

03:34.493 --> 03:37.305
Until a girl can imagine herself, can picture herself...

03:37.437 --> 03:41.219
...as a computer programmer or a combatant commander, she won't become one.

03:43.217 --> 03:47.075
So understand your power and use it wisely.

03:50.058 --> 03:55.791
My last piece of advice, this is simple but perhaps most important. Persevere.

03:57.907 --> 03:58.567
Persevere.

04:00.943 --> 04:02.832
Nothing worthwhile is easy.

04:05.415 --> 04:10.793
No one of achievement has avoided failure, sometimes catastrophic failures.

04:12.547 --> 04:13.225
But they keep at it.

04:15.401 --> 04:18.104
They learn from mistakes. They don't quit.

04:20.901 --> 04:24.499
Those quiet heroes all across this country,...

04:25.739 --> 04:27.938
...some of your parents and grandparents who are sitting here,...

04:30.522 --> 04:36.615
...no fanfare, no articles written about them, they just persevere.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.462
They just do their jobs.

04:40.751 --> 04:42.255
They meet their responsibilities.

04:43.909 --> 04:44.762
They don't quit.

04:47.474 --> 04:48.623
I'm only here because of them.

04:50.345 --> 04:54.781
They may not have set out to change the world but in small, important ways, they did.

04:56.061 --> 04:57.233
They certainly changed mine.
