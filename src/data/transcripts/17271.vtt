Today, thanks to what you have gained here, you leave Liberty with conviction and confidence as your armor.

00:08.724 --> 00:09.753
You know what you believe.

00:10.770 --> 00:11.755
You know who you are.

00:12.771 --> 00:14.287
And you know whom you will serve.

00:15.383 --> 00:22.214
Not all colleges instill that kind of confidence but it will be among the most prized qualities from your education here.

00:23.001 --> 00:31.828
Moral certainty, clear standards and a commitment to spiritual ideals will set you apart in a world that is searching for meaning.

00:33.294 --> 00:38.300
You enter a world with civilizations and economies that are far from equal.

00:39.853 --> 00:46.209
Harvard University historian David Landes devoted his lifelong study to understanding why some civilizations rise...

00:46.879 --> 00:47.991
...and why others falter.

00:49.054 --> 00:54.507
His conclusion was this: culture makes all the difference.

00:55.627 --> 01:01.284
Not natural resources, not geography, but what people believe and what they value.

01:02.633 --> 01:08.733
The power of these values, this culture, is evidenced by a recent Brookings Institution study...

01:08.817 --> 01:11.369
...that Senator Rick Santorum brought to my attention.

01:12.609 --> 01:19.067
For those who graduate from high school, get a job and marry before they have their first child,...

01:20.035 --> 01:23.873
...the probability that they will be poor is two percent.

01:25.401 --> 01:30.094
But if those things are absent, 76% will be poor.

01:31.163 --> 01:35.819
Culture. What you believe, what you value, how you live, matters.

01:37.171 --> 01:43.246
People of different faiths, like yours and mine, sometimes wonder where we can meet in common purpose...

01:43.919 --> 01:46.611
...when there are so many differences in creed and theology.

01:47.780 --> 01:50.157
Surely the answer is that we can meet in service,...

01:51.083 --> 01:55.245
...in shared moral convictions about our nation, stemming from a common worldview.

01:56.393 --> 02:02.293
The best case for this is always the example of Christian men and women working and witnessing to carry God's love into every life,...

02:03.230 --> 02:05.133
...people like the late Chuck Colson.

02:06.522 --> 02:11.133
Not long ago, Chuck recounted a story from his days just after leaving prison.

02:12.393 --> 02:15.905
He was assured by people of influence that, even with his prison record,...

02:16.486 --> 02:22.285
...a man with his connections and experience could still live very comfortably.

02:23.070 --> 02:29.306
They'd make some calls, get Chuck situated, set him up once again as an important man.

02:31.252 --> 02:36.620
His choice at that crossroads would make him instead, a great man.

02:38.257 --> 02:43.808
The call to service is one of the fundamental elements of our national character and culture.

02:44.849 --> 02:50.757
It has motivated every great movement of conscience that this hopeful, fair-minded country of ours has ever seen.

02:52.043 --> 02:55.303
Sometimes, as Dr. Viktor Frankl observed in his book for the ages,...

02:55.964 --> 03:00.725
...it's not a matter of what we're asking of life, but rather what life is asking of us.

03:01.958 --> 03:06.094
How often the answer to our own problems is to help others with theirs.

03:07.074 --> 03:12.493
You've all learned a thing or two about these gifts and the good purposes they can serve.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.325
They are yours to have and yours to share.

03:16.499 --> 03:22.140
Sometimes your Liberty education will set you apart and always it will help direct your path.

03:23.122 --> 03:26.616
And as you now leave, and make for new places near and far,...

03:27.492 --> 03:32.865
...I hope for each one of you that your path will be long and life will be kind.

03:34.179 --> 03:40.871
The ideals that brought you here, the wisdom you gained here and the friends you found here,...

03:41.633 --> 03:45.084
...may these blessings be with you always, wherever you go.

03:46.213 --> 03:51.367
Thank you all. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.
