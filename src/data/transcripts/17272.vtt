00:06.360 --> 00:10.713
You wake up and it's a day like any other day.

00:14.329 --> 00:15.063
You get dressed.

00:20.483 --> 00:21.689
You make yourself breakfast.

00:28.091 --> 00:29.071
You brush your teeth.

00:31.606 --> 00:35.428
Everything you do starts to feel like some sort of elaborate, well rehearsed routine.

00:36.463 --> 00:37.324
And after a while,...

00:37.849 --> 00:42.922
...you realize how much of your life is merely an accumulation of these seemingly insignificant moments.

00:45.597 --> 00:47.475
You go through the day only half awake.

00:48.391 --> 00:49.811
Finding comfort in the mundane.

00:50.913 --> 00:52.648
Finding ways to escape from it all.

00:57.673 --> 00:59.887
It becomes hard to tell one day from the next.

01:01.886 --> 01:05.863
The days turn into weeks, the weeks into years.

01:09.096 --> 01:17.879
And before you know it, your whole life has passed you by.

01:21.883 --> 01:25.574
What was once an exciting and mysterious future is now behind you.

01:27.071 --> 01:32.017
You've come to accept the choices you've made, the life you've created for yourself.

01:39.288 --> 01:39.654
Bye, Dad.

01:40.282 --> 01:40.659
Bye.

01:47.237 --> 01:48.911
You tell yourself that you're different.

01:49.435 --> 01:51.718
That you're not just another one of the billions of people...

01:51.871 --> 01:54.537
...put here on this Earth only to be forgotten.

01:55.399 --> 01:59.002
That somehow, all your accomplishments will amount to something.

02:01.247 --> 02:03.717
But you know there's nothing inherently special about you.

02:04.598 --> 02:07.535
All your dreams and memories which you know so intimately,...

02:08.168 --> 02:10.714
...all your thoughts and feelings which define who you are...

02:11.506 --> 02:14.674
...are destined to become nothing more than an unwritten part of history.

02:17.221 --> 02:18.866
And as the rest of the world moves on,...

02:19.500 --> 02:24.317
...all that's left behind are a collection of photographs that only provide glimpses of who you were.

02:34.639 --> 02:38.146
But then something happens right there in that ordinary day.

02:40.057 --> 02:41.355
Maybe it's only a kiss.

02:45.507 --> 02:46.629
A conversation.

02:49.407 --> 02:50.806
A song on the radio.

02:52.741 --> 02:54.090
Something that makes you laugh.

02:56.497 --> 02:57.655
An incredible view.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.193
But you're suddenly reminded how beautiful life can be.

03:03.982 --> 03:07.521
And when it does happen, it doesn't matter to you how temporary life is...

03:07.577 --> 03:10.505
...or whether or not your existence is in any way significant.

03:11.299 --> 03:15.295
All that matters is in that instantaneous yet eternal moment in time,...

03:16.239 --> 03:17.537
...you're there to experience it.
