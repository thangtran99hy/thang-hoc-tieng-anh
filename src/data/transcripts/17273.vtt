00:04.135 --> 00:05.329
Number five: Vikings.

00:05.571 --> 00:08.721
What would a Viking be without his trusty battle helmet and its impressive horns?

00:09.096 --> 00:11.479
The answer is: A more historically accurate Viking.

00:11.668 --> 00:14.714
Think for a moment about what wearing headgear like that into a battle would mean.

00:14.887 --> 00:17.887
The horns are just easy targets for your opponent to hit and knock off your helmet.

00:18.168 --> 00:20.680
Or, if you strap on your helmet, now your opponent has a convenient lever...

00:20.757 --> 00:21.915
...with which to drag you to the ground...

00:22.024 --> 00:23.923
...and something to hold onto while slitting your throat.

00:24.451 --> 00:26.265
Horned helmets are a terrible idea,...

00:26.344 --> 00:28.965
...which is why archaeologists have never found them at Viking battle sites...

00:29.069 --> 00:30.821
...and there's no evidence that they were ever used.

00:31.069 --> 00:34.112
It was poets and artists, people not known for caring about facts and reality,...

00:34.234 --> 00:36.825
...who gave the Vikings their silly hats during the late 1800s,...

00:37.032 --> 00:39.946
...long after the Vikings could 'correct' their misconceptions.

00:40.629 --> 00:41.729
Number four: Lady Godiva.

00:42.050 --> 00:45.377
The story of this 11th century English noblewoman is that her mean husband, the Earl,...

00:45.462 --> 00:47.089
...raised taxes on the townspeople of Coventry,...

00:47.192 --> 00:50.347
...which Lady Godiva and not surprisingly the locals thought were too high.

00:50.675 --> 00:53.719
She badgered her husband and he conceded in exasperation to lower the taxes...

00:53.780 --> 00:57.193
...if she rode through the town naked, assuming that she never would but she did.

00:57.511 --> 01:00.413
Because people don't like taxes, even though their whole civilization is purchased,...

01:00.553 --> 01:04.707
...Lady Godiva's story lives on notably in the Godiva logo and in popular songs.

01:04.919 --> 01:07.884
But while Lady Godiva was a real person and Coventry is a real town,...

01:07.968 --> 01:10.585
...there is no record of her nude ride from the time when it happened...

01:10.654 --> 01:12.933
...so we can safely assume the story is false.

01:13.123 --> 01:15.689
Just as with the Vikings, again poets and artists are to blame,...

01:15.793 --> 01:18.266
...who made up the tale long after Lady Godiva's death.

01:18.921 --> 01:19.864
Number three: Napoleon.

01:20.120 --> 01:23.512
Famously this tiny, tiny general, perhaps to compensate for his short stature,...

01:23.625 --> 01:27.064
...took control of France, greatly expanded its influence and dubbed himself emperor.

01:27.384 --> 01:30.512
Napoleon's official height was indeed five foot two inches...

01:30.671 --> 01:33.052
...but at the time French inches were longer than English inches,...

01:33.131 --> 01:34.300
...so doing the unit conversion,...

01:34.436 --> 01:38.105
...Napoleon's height should have been reported as five seven in England's imperial units,...

01:38.215 --> 01:42.584
...which is short by today's standard but was average or slightly above average in the early 1800s.

01:42.807 --> 01:44.955
However England, with its eternal love for all things French,...

01:45.045 --> 01:50.077
...didn't care and went with the "Napoleon is so short - LOL" version of the story in newspapers and cartoons.

01:50.309 --> 01:53.709
Meanwhile, Napoleon was busy introducing the Metric System to France and the wider world...

01:53.793 --> 01:56.855
...to standardize measurements so this sort of confusion would never happen again...

01:57.034 --> 01:59.035
...and thankfully the whole world now uses metric.

01:59.446 --> 01:59.988
Mostly.

02:00.389 --> 02:00.823
Sort of.
