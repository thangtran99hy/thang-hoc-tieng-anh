00:01.097 --> 00:03.760
The year's most hotly anticipated public offering...

00:04.096 --> 00:09.139
... kicked off at 11 AM Friday, in New York with founder Mark Zuckerberg...

00:09.420 --> 00:14.571
...ringing the Nasdaq opening bell remotely from Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California.

00:15.089 --> 00:20.515
Despite the hype and the celebratory hugs, the stock's performance on day one proved underwhelming.

00:20.977 --> 00:24.223
That came as no surprise to investment strategist Michael Gayad.

00:24.482 --> 00:28.985
We've actually seen a few of that type of behavior in some other tech IPOs this year...

00:29.471 --> 00:30.903
...where the initial excitement was high,...

00:31.012 --> 00:33.751
...there was a lot of buying and then it just gradually fell off.

00:33.945 --> 00:39.279
After opening at $38 a share, Facebook stock closed just 23 cents higher.

00:39.617 --> 00:44.143
That's a big wake-up call for a company that's now worth more than a $100,000,000,000,...

00:44.317 --> 00:45.886
...says media analyst Nick Thomas.

00:46.249 --> 00:47.753
Everyone loves Facebook because it's free.

00:48.073 --> 00:50.407
The big challenge for Facebook is that once it has shareholders,...

00:50.475 --> 00:53.203
...it's going to have to start generating serious revenue.

00:53.387 --> 00:57.626
Among the doubters was automaker General Motors, which pulled its ads from Facebook,...

00:57.808 --> 01:00.983
...saying it didn't think the social network could deliver results.

01:01.317 --> 01:04.182
Some analysts had been warning that Facebook was overvalued.

01:04.598 --> 01:10.289
Jeff Corbin at KCSA Communications told VOA he had no plans to invest in Facebook.

01:10.688 --> 01:13.339
How do we put a value on it? Right now, it's all advertising.

01:13.813 --> 01:18.133
If the advertising industry determines that Facebook ads don't really help,...

01:19.067 --> 01:22.491
...then they're going to see a decrease in their revenue.

01:22.613 --> 01:24.909
But Facebook is not without its believers.

01:25.253 --> 01:28.263
Jonah Peretti is the founder of Buzzfeed.com.

01:28.440 --> 01:31.405
It's a phenomenal company when you look at the level of engagement

01:31.604 --> 01:32.699
...and there's nothing to compare it to.

01:32.850 --> 01:36.269
Nothing has ever had that level of engagement before.

01:36.364 --> 01:38.334
And so I think they have a really bright future...

01:38.621 --> 01:40.825
...and that people haven't quite fully understood...

01:40.944 --> 01:44.833
...the impact they're gonna have on the Internet and on business and on media.

01:45.039 --> 01:46.685
Despite a disappointing first day,...

01:46.866 --> 01:51.374
...the world's largest social network, with an estimated 900 million users worldwide,...

01:51.703 --> 01:54.377
...managed to raise more than 18 billion dollars,...

01:54.713 --> 01:58.227
...making it the largest technology IPO in US history.

01:58.710 --> 02:01.444
