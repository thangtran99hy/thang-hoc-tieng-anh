This has been an interesting week for Mark Zuckerberg, on Friday his company,...

00:03.761 --> 00:06.925
...a little outfit called Facebook, started selling shares on Wall Street,...

00:07.040 --> 00:11.700
...instantly earning the 28-year-old 19 billion dollars, on paper at least.

00:12.098 --> 00:14.997
And then yesterday, he got married in a secret surprise ceremony.

00:15.420 --> 00:18.353
Ron is back with this pretty major status update.

00:18.803 --> 00:20.979
This is a huge week for Mark Zuckerberg.

00:21.413 --> 00:24.159
On Monday, he celebrated his 28th birthday, on Friday,...

00:24.501 --> 00:28.023
...Facebook had that IPO and yesterday, he tied the knot with his longtime girlfriend,...

00:28.327 --> 00:32.620
...which he announced to the public by changing his status on Facebook to "married."

00:33.463 --> 00:34.307
So let's do this.

00:35.293 --> 00:40.716
On Friday, this seemed to be the biggest day of Mark Zuckerberg's young life:...

00:41.439 --> 00:45.503
...taking his company public and making himself 20 billion dollars richer.

00:45.891 --> 00:48.865
But now it turns out this maybe the biggest day of his life.

00:49.654 --> 00:53.137
On Saturday afternoon, one of the youngest billionaires on the planet...

00:53.523 --> 00:58.519
..took off his hoodie, donned a suit and married his longtime girlfriend Priscilla Chan.

00:58.796 --> 01:03.995
For all his billions, this was a small ceremony held in his backyard in Palo Alto, California.

01:04.411 --> 01:06.023
Less than a hundred guests attended...

01:06.332 --> 01:08.296
...and they didn't even know they were coming to a wedding.

01:08.675 --> 01:11.314
They thought it was a graduation party for Priscilla.

01:11.461 --> 01:14.077
With all the news that Facebook had been taking up this week,...

01:14.160 --> 01:15.725
...this is the one that nobody ever expected.

01:16.078 --> 01:21.299
That on the heels of the second largest IPO in American history, the CEO gets married.

01:21.656 --> 01:24.643
The two have been dating since they were students at Harvard together,...

01:25.007 --> 01:27.063
...before Facebook was Facebook.

01:27.445 --> 01:28.865
This is not an impulse buy.

01:29.365 --> 01:33.563
This is not your newly minted billionaire's frivolous expenditure.

01:33.988 --> 01:35.551
He had designed the ring beforehand.

01:36.025 --> 01:38.605
He had been dating the girl for eight years.

01:38.859 --> 01:42.461
Chan is a pediatrician who just graduated from medical school this week.

01:42.931 --> 01:47.349
Zuckerberg spoke to Robin Roberts about how the story she told from the ER...

01:47.766 --> 01:51.768
...helped inspire a new initiative on Facebook to foster organ donations.

01:52.283 --> 01:53.292
She is gonna be a pediatrician.

01:53.387 --> 01:57.953
So our dinner conversations are often about Facebook and kids,...

01:58.033 --> 01:59.051
...and the kids that she's meeting.

01:59.689 --> 02:04.425
She'll see them getting sicker, and then all of a sudden an organ becomes available and...

02:04.683 --> 02:07.917
...she comes home and it looks like her face is all lit up...

02:08.045 --> 02:10.646
...because someone's life is gonna be better because of this.

02:11.141 --> 02:17.242
Now, she is Mrs. Zuckerberg and her young billionaire husband's life is just a little richer.

02:18.281 --> 02:19.898
And the bride's wedding ring was described...

02:19.989 --> 02:22.947
...as a simple ruby that was designed by Zuckerberg himself.

02:23.020 --> 02:25.729
No word on where the couple is going for their honeymoon or when.

02:26.185 --> 02:29.435
So far on Zuckerberg's Facebook page, the wedding announcement and photo...

02:29.723 --> 02:34.049
...have gotten, listen to this one, 664,000 likes.
