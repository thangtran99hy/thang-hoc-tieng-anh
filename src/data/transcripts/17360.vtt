In the heart of London at Trafalgar Square, the official Olympic countdown clock...

00:10.823 --> 00:14.084
...gets a steady stream of people posing for pictures.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.819
But most of them are foreign tourists;...

00:17.158 --> 00:22.565
...many Londoners appear indifferent, worried, or actually hostile toward the games.

00:22.745 --> 00:23.877
I just think it's a waste of money.

00:24.324 --> 00:24.555
Really?

00:24.698 --> 00:28.131
Yeah, all the money that's being wasted; could've been spent on something else.

00:28.311 --> 00:29.668
It's already busy up London.

00:30.173 --> 00:33.304
Imagine when the Olympics is here, imagine how busy it's gonna be everywhere. 

00:33.372 --> 00:34.561
No one is gonna be able to get around.

00:34.775 --> 00:40.079
Stuff they've designed to support the Olympics are absolutely hideous; I think that hasn't helped.

00:40.174 --> 00:46.327
The Olympic logo thing is a complete massive farce, and those mascot toys that they've got;...

00:46.525 --> 00:50.229
...I mean, I haven't met anyone who thinks they aren't completely ridiculous.

00:51.110 --> 00:56.976
The Olympics items ranging in price from just a few dollars to hundreds can be hard to find.

00:57.255 --> 01:00.366
They're only available at specially licensed shops...

01:00.435 --> 01:05.082
...and in official London 2012 stores, mainly at transport hubs.

01:05.446 --> 01:10.238
Olympics merchandising chief Simon Lilley says that's part of the game strategy.

01:10.397 --> 01:12.643
I think the key thing is we are focusing on the quality of distribution...

01:12.718 --> 01:15.315
...so we want them in the right places, putting our brand in the right way.

01:15.458 --> 01:17.773
So, I think we've got selective distribution,...

01:18.056 --> 01:20.098
...and I think this will build and build as we move towards the games.

01:21.325 --> 01:27.597
And London 2012 officials like Jonathan Edwards believe the enthusiasm will build as well.

01:27.940 --> 01:31.181
When you're involved within the Olympic and Paralympic world,...

01:31.294 --> 01:33.186
...it feels like that's everything.

01:33.697 --> 01:36.017
But for people out in the streets, it is kind of like,...

01:36.143 --> 01:37.385
..."Oh yeah, the Olympics, that's in the summer."

01:38.048 --> 01:40.777
And they kind of engage with it when it's actually here.

01:42.176 --> 01:45.874
For now, many people in Britain are more focused on celebrations...

01:45.991 --> 01:49.229
...marking the 60th year of Queen Elizabeth's reign.

01:49.839 --> 01:52.338
But some are getting excited about the Olympics,...

01:52.666 --> 01:55.934
...particularly those who come out to see the Olympic Park.

01:56.087 --> 01:58.292
I think people do like to moan, don't they?

01:58.399 --> 02:00.725
That's their default position, they like to moan.

02:01.010 --> 02:05.735
So, let them moan, and I'm quite happy about it.

02:06.437 --> 02:17.119
I think that people will forget the cost; it's the atmosphere and the new life that it brings that people value.

02:17.392 --> 02:19.689
I think overall it's cool.

02:19.755 --> 02:20.819
I'm going to look back on it and say,...

02:20.883 --> 02:22.794
..."Yeah, I was in London when the Olympics happened."

02:23.501 --> 02:26.501
That's the attitude Olympic officials are hoping for,...

02:26.603 --> 02:29.243
...but many Londoners are not there yet.
