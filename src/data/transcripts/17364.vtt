Hi, I'm Jessica with TopTenREVIEWS.

00:09.175 --> 00:11.802
Landing that job is more important than ever.

00:12.099 --> 00:14.127
So, let's go over two different scenarios...

00:14.187 --> 00:17.485
...so you can find the best interviewing skills to ace that interview.

00:18.212 --> 00:20.481
In this scenario, our interviewee, Kyle,...

00:20.586 --> 00:24.197
...doesn't start off his interview on the right step because he's late.

00:25.037 --> 00:28.305
Kyle did not dress appropriately for his interview.

00:28.633 --> 00:30.363
A hat, a shirt unbuttoned;...

00:30.719 --> 00:35.401
...he has a sloppy look that can transition from sloppy look to sloppy work.

00:36.299 --> 00:41.035
Kyle is talking too much about something the interviewer didn't even ask him about,...

00:41.439 --> 00:43.186
...as he goes on and on.

00:43.559 --> 00:46.189
The interviewer is bored and unimpressed.

00:46.622 --> 00:49.436
Make sure to be concise and answer questions directly.

00:50.175 --> 00:55.007
He has bad posture and Kyle isn't making eye contact with the interviewer either.

00:55.267 --> 00:59.803
Kyle didn't come ready with any materials like a resume or a paper to take notes.

01:00.548 --> 01:02.145
Don't chew gum.

01:02.487 --> 01:05.631
If you need good breath, go for a breath mint instead.

01:06.222 --> 01:09.141
And last but not least, Kyle had bad hygiene.

01:09.552 --> 01:13.323
By the look on that interviewer's face, I'd say he didn't get the job.

01:13.872 --> 01:17.073
Obviously, doing an interview like Kyle's won't get you anywhere.

01:17.513 --> 01:21.974
You should also remember to never be cocky or appear desperate to get that job.

01:22.465 --> 01:24.857
And you shouldn't talk too much or use jargon...

01:24.929 --> 01:27.544
...and use inappropriate language during an interview.
