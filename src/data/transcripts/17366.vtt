I'm Lisa Birnbach for howdini.com.

00:06.808 --> 00:08.061
You're going for a job interview.

00:08.228 --> 00:11.796
How to make the interview work so that you land the job?

00:12.174 --> 00:14.046
Carolyn Bigda from Money magazine is with us.

00:14.215 --> 00:15.001
How do you do that?

00:15.722 --> 00:22.100
Well, some surveys show that hiring managers actually make their opinion of you...

00:22.365 --> 00:24.365
...within the first ten minutes of meeting you.

00:24.489 --> 00:27.423
So, you want to make a really good first impression.

00:27.643 --> 00:28.365
How do you do that?

00:28.962 --> 00:31.245
Well, the first thing is your appearance.

00:31.393 --> 00:34.285
You want to walk in wearing a nice, crisp suit...

00:34.363 --> 00:37.287
...or whatever appropriate outfit is for this interview.

00:37.670 --> 00:41.786
You want to give a firm handshake and you want to look the hiring manager directly in the eye.

00:43.079 --> 00:43.948
Don't people know that?

00:44.805 --> 00:50.971
Yeah, you might be surprised by how many people, they might feel more casual about it...

00:51.056 --> 00:54.488
...or they are shy and so they haven't practiced this...

00:54.565 --> 00:58.381
...and they're not used to being assertive and putting themselves out there.

00:59.132 --> 01:00.212
What about clothing?

01:00.331 --> 01:03.577
Unless you're working or applying for a job in the fashion industry,...

01:03.654 --> 01:07.117
...shouldn't you be on the conservative side rather than very fashionable?

01:07.711 --> 01:14.686
Exactly. I mean, the safe bet is always to wear a nice suit, neutral colors;...

01:14.789 --> 01:19.511
...come in wearing something that's not too flashy, and just be dressed appropriately.

01:20.876 --> 01:24.735
You want to look professional and I think everyone has a sense of what professional is.

01:24.883 --> 01:27.891
One other thing you want to practice before you go into this interview...

01:28.005 --> 01:30.144
...is a quick sales pitch about yourself.

01:30.443 --> 01:34.144
Something that maybe has bullet points or just gets to the heart...

01:34.231 --> 01:38.554
...of what you've done over the last couple of years to impress this manager.

01:39.622 --> 01:43.325
Practicing this is key because it has to come across as smooth...

01:43.523 --> 01:49.094
... but you also want it to have specific examples maybe, or just some key points...

01:49.204 --> 01:52.221
...that the hiring manager will be really excited about and interested in.

01:52.636 --> 01:58.756
But not so professional that it seems like you're just a sales person.

01:58.915 --> 02:02.435
Exactly. You want to keep it down-to-earth and relaxed as much as possible...

02:02.507 --> 02:04.609
...which is why practicing it is a good idea...

02:04.724 --> 02:09.198
...because when you've got it sort of routine inside of you, it's much easier to deliver.

02:09.595 --> 02:12.688
Carolyn, what if you've just been fired by your previous employer,...

02:12.977 --> 02:17.127
...do you have to be honest about that, and how do you position that in a job interview?

02:17.598 --> 02:21.167
You do have to be honest if they do ask you why you left your job...

02:22.052 --> 02:24.785
...but you want to stay positive on this topic.

02:25.174 --> 02:27.813
You don't want to come in as someone who has a lot of resentment...

02:28.124 --> 02:30.247
...or you've got a grudge against your former employer.

02:30.930 --> 02:33.191
If they ask you why you're looking for a job,...

02:33.679 --> 02:37.176
...a good response is to say you're looking for that next opportunity,...

02:37.243 --> 02:41.785
...to take that next step in your career, to apply your skills in a different way.

02:42.011 --> 02:43.875
You want to come across as a team player?

02:44.187 --> 02:47.299
Yes, coming across as a team player is always key...

02:47.639 --> 02:51.061
...but also showing leadership skills also impresses employers.

02:51.142 --> 02:56.658
So, if you can come up with examples of both in your interview, those are bonus points basically.

02:56.829 --> 02:59.390
And obviously finally, you want to look like a hard worker...

02:59.463 --> 03:02.299
...who will be committed to the mission of the company you're interviewing with.

03:02.419 --> 03:06.542
Exactly, which is why again showing specific examples of the results...

03:07.161 --> 03:11.707
...that you had at your previous company will really impress your employer...

03:11.837 --> 03:15.721
...because they see that you come in and you do have an impact that you will produce.

03:16.350 --> 03:18.228
Carolyn Bigda, thank you so much.

03:18.432 --> 03:19.889
Again, I've learned something new.

03:20.295 --> 03:22.493
For howdini.com, I'm Lisa Birnbach.
