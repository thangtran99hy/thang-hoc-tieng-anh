00:07.175 --> 00:08.167
Watch that posture!

00:08.437 --> 00:11.755
When it comes to first impressions, your body language goes a long way...

00:11.881 --> 00:13.923
...in conveying confidence and competence.

00:14.449 --> 00:16.803
Learning how to carry yourself during a job interview...

00:16.898 --> 00:20.376
...may mean the difference between being written off and being remembered.

00:22.274 --> 00:27.841
You will need a strong walk, a firm grip, a connection and clarity.

00:28.641 --> 00:33.969
Step one. Walk in, make eye contact and deliver a handshake with a firm grip,...

00:34.220 --> 00:36.070
...looking your interviewer right in the eye.

00:36.536 --> 00:39.864
Confident body language suggests you are the perfect candidate for the job.

00:40.827 --> 00:44.497
Step two. Sit up straight with your feet firmly on the floor.

00:44.801 --> 00:48.254
Don't rock, drum fingers, glance around or shake your foot.

00:48.625 --> 00:54.375
Slumping, fidgeting or apparent impatience comes off as low self-esteem, or worse, disinterest.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.750
Step three. Connect with your interviewer.

00:58.046 --> 01:01.380
Nod, use your hands while talking and be enthusiastic...

01:01.473 --> 01:04.966
...without overdoing it to the point of distraction or insincerity.

01:05.927 --> 01:10.740
Step four. Enunciate clearly, taking time to consider questions.

01:11.147 --> 01:14.176
Convey the sincerity they can expect you to bring to the job.

01:14.568 --> 01:18.636
Speak slowly, deliberately, with resonance and confidence.

01:19.615 --> 01:22.293
Step five. Smile once in a while.

01:22.534 --> 01:25.076
Be personable and feel free to ask questions,...

01:25.292 --> 01:28.818
...taking control so that the interview becomes a relaxed conversation.

01:29.457 --> 01:33.368
Mirror the interviewer's body language, which is known as a joining technique.

01:33.538 --> 01:36.993
If their arms and/or legs are crossed or closed, do the same.

01:37.299 --> 01:40.341
If they move their hands when they speak, they're considered open.

01:41.437 --> 01:44.819
Step six. Walk out with purpose and strength.

01:45.071 --> 01:48.807
No matter how you feel you've done, leave with your head held high.

01:50.365 --> 01:51.010
Did you know?

01:51.466 --> 01:55.022
From 2006 through 2008, the number of Americans...

01:55.113 --> 01:59.796
...receiving outplacement support after a layoff increased by 50 percent.
