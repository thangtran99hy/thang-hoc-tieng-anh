Hi! This video is about the /ə/ sound.

00:04.683 --> 00:07.065
A common challenge with the /ə/ sound...

00:07.156 --> 00:10.357
...is that the speaker will sometimes move the sound forward.

00:10.720 --> 00:13.187
So a word like "but" sounds like "bit".

00:13.459 --> 00:14.647
Now, let's practice.

00:15.031 --> 00:19.657
Place your tongue behind your lower front teeth and stretch from the back.

00:20.119 --> 00:21.551
That's the /ə/ sound.

00:22.289 --> 00:24.127
Now let's practice with a few words...

00:24.245 --> 00:28.499
...and notice the /ə/ sound is in unstressed syllables.

00:29.345 --> 00:31.462
Here is the /ə/ when it starts a word.

00:32.296 --> 00:33.208
Apply,..

00:34.212 --> 00:35.153
...observe,...

00:36.100 --> 00:37.087
...admire,...

00:37.876 --> 00:38.631
...again,...

00:39.819 --> 00:40.739
...awake,...

00:41.545 --> 00:42.362
...achieve.

00:43.491 --> 00:46.963
Now let's try the /ə/ in the middle of a word.

00:48.316 --> 00:49.349
...Automatic,...

00:50.232 --> 00:51.389
...meditate,...

00:52.355 --> 00:53.493
...manicure,...

00:54.249 --> 00:55.406
...capacity,...

00:56.261 --> 00:57.247
...California.

00:58.619 --> 01:02.841
Now let's give it a shot at the end of a word and keep it nice and easy!

01:04.186 --> 01:05.003
India,...

01:05.861 --> 01:06.833
...Sherpa,...

01:07.839 --> 01:08.779
...pasta,...

01:09.852 --> 01:10.545
...data,...

01:11.528 --> 01:12.283
...soda.

01:12.884 --> 01:17.293
You may have noticed that the /ə/ sound can actually be spelled in English...

01:17.533 --> 01:22.870
...with several different letters including "i", "a", and "o".

01:23.151 --> 01:27.931
So put this into play as you practice on EnglishCentral and good luck!
