Hi! This video focuses on the /i/ sound.

00:05.359 --> 00:07.746
/i/ is a front vowel sound.

00:08.305 --> 00:11.661
It is the closest or the highest front vowel sound.

00:12.229 --> 00:20.175
To make the /i/ sound, you need to direct the front of your tongue up toward the hard palate while you are making the sound.

00:21.174 --> 00:25.919
Notice how the front arches up while the tip stays down.

00:27.214 --> 00:27.863
/i/

00:29.352 --> 00:35.457
Most often the challenge with the /i/ sound is using it in place of /e/ or /a/.

00:36.232 --> 00:40.071
So for example, beat can become bit or bet.

00:40.739 --> 00:47.238
Practice along with me with the sentences and work to find your precision in each of the vowels.

00:47.645 --> 00:48.463
Here we go.

00:49.562 --> 00:52.314
She wants to sit in that seat.

00:53.430 --> 00:56.085
There are some sheep on that ship.

00:57.340 --> 00:59.668
At least let's make a list.

01:00.915 --> 01:02.714
They are mean men.

01:04.181 --> 01:06.375
That hairy beast is best.

01:07.547 --> 01:09.915
I found a bead in her bed.

01:10.861 --> 01:15.397
