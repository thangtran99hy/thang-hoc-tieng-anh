Hi! This segment is focused on the /s/ sound.

00:05.684 --> 00:08.495
/s/ is a voiceless consonant sound.

00:08.941 --> 00:14.983
You should feel some friction and air flow between the tip of your tongue and the gum ridge.

00:15.914 --> 00:22.878
You make the /s/ sound by raising the tip of your tongue toward the gum ridge, but not touching.

00:23.549 --> 00:28.003
You should feel a whoosh of air between the tongue and the gum ridge.

00:28.739 --> 00:29.604
/s/

00:30.726 --> 00:39.238
/s/ can also be made with the tip of the tongue down by moving the top of the front of your tongue toward the gum ridge like this.

00:40.023 --> 00:40.749
/s/

00:42.194 --> 00:48.481
A common challenge with the /s/ sound is what's called a sibilant S and that means...

00:48.789 --> 00:53.143
...your S could be very whistley and often this has to do with placement.

00:53.920 --> 01:01.791
Making the /s/ sound with the tip of your tongue up is helpful in preparing for consonant combination sounds.

01:02.599 --> 01:06.708
You'll need a chopstick to help you with the exercises that we are going to do together.

01:07.395 --> 01:18.112
In these exercises you'll feel the tip of the tongue press up against the chopstick for for the /t/ sound and release for the /s/ sound.

01:18.756 --> 01:20.345
Try these along with me.

01:24.001 --> 01:28.963
Pete, seem, seem.

01:29.639 --> 01:31.805
Can you feel the placement of the /s/?

01:32.253 --> 01:33.813
Let's do a few more together.

01:35.930 --> 01:40.327
Pit, sick, sick.

01:42.031 --> 01:46.082
Pet, sell, sell.

01:47.721 --> 01:51.618
Pat, sack, sack.

01:53.414 --> 01:59.072
Make sure to try some more /s/ practice on EnglishCentral and good luck!
