Hi! This video is focused on the /t/ sound.

00:06.052 --> 00:09.686
/t/ is a plosive voiceless consonant sound.

00:10.027 --> 00:13.586
And that means that there's a lot of energy behind the sound.

00:14.126 --> 00:21.460
The /t/ sound is produced by bringing the tip of your tongue to your gum ridge and releasing it...

00:21.731 --> 00:23.987
...like this, /t/.

00:25.450 --> 00:31.028
A common challenge in making this sound is when the speaker uses the blade of the tongue...

00:31.381 --> 00:35.051
...or the top of the tongue and presses it against the front of the teeth.

00:35.633 --> 00:38.872
This creates a very splashy /t/ sound.

00:39.201 --> 00:42.477
Here is a splashy version, /t/ /t/.

00:43.029 --> 00:46.713
And here is a precise version, /t/ /t/.

00:48.087 --> 00:49.551
Let's practice together.

00:50.009 --> 00:56.468
One of my favorite ways to find the correct placement for the /t/ sound requires a prop.

00:56.784 --> 01:01.427
So please grab a chopstick so you can do this exercise along with me.

01:02.605 --> 01:07.222
First, scratch the tip of your tongue and then press up on the gum ridge....

01:07.516 --> 01:11.391
...on the exact spot that you want the tip to hit.

01:12.038 --> 01:14.432
And now let's do a few tongue ups together.

01:14.885 --> 01:23.237
The purpose of this exercise is to recondition your tongue to go to the specific placement for the /t/ sound.

01:23.845 --> 01:24.665
Here we go.

01:25.449 --> 01:26.947
Tip, release.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.084
Tip, release.

01:29.753 --> 01:31.340
Tip, release.

01:32.032 --> 01:36.939
Make sure that your jaw stays released and the tongue is doing the work.

01:37.275 --> 01:39.770
Try this at least ten times.

01:40.113 --> 01:42.727
Now let's try a few words together.

01:43.855 --> 01:44.629
Tell.

01:46.025 --> 01:46.942
Tea.

01:48.097 --> 01:48.940
Tap.

01:50.723 --> 01:51.605
Sitting.

01:52.782 --> 01:53.423
Batter.

01:54.653 --> 01:55.316
Writer.

01:56.910 --> 01:57.821
Cast.

01:58.983 --> 01:59.731
Cute.

02:00.852 --> 02:01.545
Part.

02:02.977 --> 02:06.116
And a little tongue twister for fun,...

02:06.868 --> 02:08.861
...tea for two and two for tea.

02:09.554 --> 02:10.853
Tea for two and two for tea.

02:10.987 --> 02:12.201
Tea for two and two for tea.

02:12.703 --> 02:17.245
Try this out as you practice on EnglishCentral and good luck!
