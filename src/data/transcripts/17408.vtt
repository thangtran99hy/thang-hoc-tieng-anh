00:01.581 --> 00:05.091
I live where the weather changes during the year.

00:06.091 --> 00:08.477
It changes with each season.

00:09.491 --> 00:11.310
We have four seasons.

00:12.431 --> 00:14.232
We start with spring.

00:15.239 --> 00:16.715
Then comes summer.

00:17.697 --> 00:19.220
Then comes fall.

00:20.223 --> 00:21.813
Then comes winter.

00:22.821 --> 00:25.583
It is spring and the snow melts.

00:26.665 --> 00:29.909
It gets warmer, and plants begin to grow.

00:30.931 --> 00:34.727
The days get longer, and the nights get shorter.

00:35.723 --> 00:37.140
I wear my jacket.

00:38.172 --> 00:39.259
It is summer.

00:40.309 --> 00:43.578
It gets hot, and the plants grow bigger.

00:44.608 --> 00:48.070
The days are long, and the nights are short.

00:49.052 --> 00:50.607
I wear my shorts.

00:51.673 --> 00:52.943
It is fall.

00:53.900 --> 00:57.843
It gets cooler, and the plants stop growing.

00:58.831 --> 01:02.817
The days get shorter, and the nights get longer.

01:03.886 --> 01:05.347
I wear my sweater.

01:06.386 --> 01:07.519
It is winter.

01:08.575 --> 01:11.940
It is cold, and many plants die.

01:12.983 --> 01:16.277
The snow begins to fall, and the days are short.

01:17.367 --> 01:18.391
I wear my coat.

01:19.442 --> 01:22.374
The weather has changed with each season.

01:23.450 --> 01:25.507
It got warmer and warmer.

01:26.556 --> 01:28.865
The days got longer and longer.

01:29.945 --> 01:32.413
Then it got cooler and cooler.

01:33.456 --> 01:35.866
The days got shorter and shorter.

01:36.867 --> 01:39.497
Next, I will see spring again.

01:40.551 --> 01:43.172
The cycle will start all over.
