00:00.322 --> 00:02.832
The best way to sound like you know what you're talking about...

00:03.239 --> 00:05.041
...is to know what you're talking about.

00:05.293 --> 00:11.654
Once you've achieved this, approaching confidence as a desired goal...

00:12.419 --> 00:16.348
...has much to do with cognitive anxiety, psyching yourself out.

00:16.591 --> 00:20.949
The first thing you want to do is to convince yourself that you're a confident person.

00:21.145 --> 00:23.409
Now this may sound cheesy at times,...

00:23.536 --> 00:29.315
...but telling yourself over and over again that you are who you want to become,...

00:29.840 --> 00:33.605
...that you don't even want to become that because you already are, is invaluable.

00:34.369 --> 00:37.237
Driving to the event, start talking to yourself.

00:37.596 --> 00:40.860
Finish the sentence, "I am confident."

00:41.465 --> 00:42.602
"I'm composed."

00:43.127 --> 00:44.269
"I'm excited to be here."

00:44.357 --> 00:46.111
"I'm compassionate for my audience."

00:46.186 --> 00:50.726
Telling yourself these things over and over again will convince yourself of that.

00:51.932 --> 00:53.932
Are you asking yourself, "Why am I not confident?"

00:54.004 --> 00:55.914
Because your brain is gonna come up with an answer.

00:56.378 --> 01:00.569
Instead of asking yourself, "Why am I not confident?", tell yourself that you are.

01:01.092 --> 01:03.448
Literally repeat, "I'm confident."

01:03.878 --> 01:04.789
"I'm composed."

01:05.343 --> 01:06.575
"I'm excited to be here."

01:06.846 --> 01:08.347
"I will benefit my audience."
