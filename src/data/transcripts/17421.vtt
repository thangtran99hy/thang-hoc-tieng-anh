00:02.705 --> 00:07.477
"I'm building the fire station," said Hannah.

00:08.603 --> 00:12.645
"I'm building the pizza place," said Andy.

00:13.803 --> 00:16.625
Their school project was almost done.

00:17.667 --> 00:19.636
The friends looked at their town.

00:20.947 --> 00:23.941
It had a police station and a school.

00:25.102 --> 00:27.721
It had an ice cream store, too.

00:28.939 --> 00:33.061
"Now we need some people," said Hannah.

00:34.267 --> 00:40.651
"Mom, can you take us to the store to buy people for our town?" asked Hannah.

00:41.757 --> 00:46.591
"Not now, sweetie, I'm making dinner," said her mom.

00:49.702 --> 00:53.751
Hannah groaned, "We need people!"

00:54.783 --> 00:58.113
Hannah went into her older sister Kate's room.

00:59.013 --> 01:00.903
Kate was playing outside.

01:01.746 --> 01:06.465
Hannah stood on a chair to reach the tiny dolls from around the world.

01:07.462 --> 01:10.357
Then Hannah quickly walked past the kitchen.

01:11.567 --> 01:14.584
"Hannah," said her mom,...

01:15.977 --> 01:20.047
"...you know you can't play with Kate's dolls without asking her first."

01:20.737 --> 01:24.905
"But we need people," cried Hannah.

01:26.495 --> 01:30.729
"You can use my baby dolls," offered Lucy.

01:31.451 --> 01:35.742
Hannah's three-year-old sister, Lucy, held out two baby dolls.

01:37.130 --> 01:42.600
"Those dolls are too big for our town," pouted Hannah.

01:43.671 --> 01:47.221
"But thanks, anyway," she said.

01:48.388 --> 01:50.973
Then Hannah smiled a big smile.

01:52.117 --> 01:55.063
She ran to her room to get her art box.

01:56.251 --> 01:59.876
"Let's make the people!" she shouted.

02:00.894 --> 02:03.928
"Yeah!" agreed Andy.

02:04.923 --> 02:08.336
"I'll make the workers," he said.

02:09.473 --> 02:13.068
"I'll make the shoppers," Hannah said.

02:13.941 --> 02:15.880
The friends colored and cut.

02:17.020 --> 02:18.963
They glued and they taped.

02:19.948 --> 02:25.280
Glitter, yarn, paper and cloth made popsicle sticks become...

02:25.899 --> 02:33.027
...firefighters, teachers, police officers, pizza makers, and ice cream scoopers!

02:34.177 --> 02:37.345
"Neat!" said Lucy.

02:38.391 --> 02:41.580
"Wow!" said Hannah's mom.

02:42.646 --> 02:45.116
"Cool!" said Kate.

02:46.012 --> 02:52.119
"Tomorrow, let's build a zoo and make our own animals," said Andy.

02:52.916 --> 02:56.108
"Great idea!" said Hannah.
