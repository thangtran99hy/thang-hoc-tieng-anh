00:02.370 --> 00:04.620
Mike was having a bad day.

00:05.037 --> 00:07.885
At breakfast, he tripped over Tiger's bowl.

00:08.367 --> 00:10.389
Cat food spilled everywhere.

00:11.411 --> 00:12.875
I'll clean up, clumsy.

00:13.960 --> 00:15.485
teased his older sister.

00:16.471 --> 00:18.183
You need to get the bus.

00:19.331 --> 00:20.183
Thanks!

00:21.167 --> 00:21.981
called Mike.

00:23.165 --> 00:27.054
At the school library, Mike checked out eight shark books.

00:28.019 --> 00:30.085
THUMP THUMP fell the books.

00:30.530 --> 00:31.960
He couldn't carry them all.

00:33.135 --> 00:33.990
Need help?

00:34.747 --> 00:35.609
asked Pam.

00:36.559 --> 00:38.227
I only have two books.

00:39.227 --> 00:40.133
Sure!

00:41.125 --> 00:41.896
said Mike.

00:42.757 --> 00:43.727
Thanks, Pam!

00:44.860 --> 00:47.439
Pam carried some of his books back to class.

00:48.585 --> 00:52.218
Time to frost cookies for the fall festival this afternoon.

00:53.112 --> 00:54.072
said Ms. Platt.

00:55.001 --> 00:56.355
Take out your frosting.

00:57.483 --> 00:58.463
Uh-oh.

00:59.344 --> 01:00.078
said Mike.

01:01.129 --> 01:03.031
My frosting is at home.

01:04.006 --> 01:05.905
You can use some of mine.

01:06.805 --> 01:07.741
said José.

01:08.582 --> 01:09.859
I have a lot.

01:10.901 --> 01:11.954
Mike smiled.

01:12.757 --> 01:13.870
Thanks, José.

01:15.038 --> 01:16.809
The fall festival was here.

01:17.680 --> 01:21.387
Mike was carving a pumpkin, when SPLASH.

01:22.138 --> 01:24.589
His elbow bumped his orange punch.

01:25.507 --> 01:27.995
Now you look like a pumpkin.

01:28.897 --> 01:29.785
joked Dave.

01:30.473 --> 01:32.469
I'll get my soccer shirt.

01:33.097 --> 01:33.874
Dave said.

01:34.777 --> 01:36.083
You can wear it.

01:36.964 --> 01:37.823
Great!

01:38.639 --> 01:39.387
said Mike.

01:40.347 --> 01:41.541
Thanks, Dave.

01:42.914 --> 01:46.893
That night, Mike told his mom all that went wrong that day.

01:47.355 --> 01:50.541
But he also told her how nice everyone had been.

01:51.347 --> 01:53.896
Just then, Mike heard a CRASH!

01:55.143 --> 01:57.646
His sister tripped over Tiger's bowl.

01:58.636 --> 02:00.146
Need help, clumsy?

02:01.545 --> 02:04.085
laughed Mike, as he came down the stairs.

02:05.588 --> 02:06.533
Thanks.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.825
said his sleepy sister.
