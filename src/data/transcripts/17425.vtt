00:02.531 --> 00:06.277
I bet I can jump over the river.

00:07.321 --> 00:08.381
said the bear.

00:09.511 --> 00:11.872
I bet you can't.

00:12.877 --> 00:14.359
said the kangaroo.

00:15.393 --> 00:18.420
So the bear ran to the river.

00:19.469 --> 00:20.409
He jumped.

00:21.532 --> 00:23.746
Splash, went the bear.

00:24.806 --> 00:27.347
He did not jump over the river.

00:28.471 --> 00:31.820
I bet I can jump over the wall.

00:32.879 --> 00:33.811
said the bear.

00:34.886 --> 00:37.491
I bet you can't.

00:38.621 --> 00:39.592
said the goat.

00:40.711 --> 00:44.789
So the bear ran toward the tall wall.

00:45.880 --> 00:46.829
He jumped.

00:47.886 --> 00:50.155
Splat, went the bear.

00:51.175 --> 00:54.374
He did not jump over the tall wall.

00:55.393 --> 00:58.758
I bet I can swing on the rope.

00:59.771 --> 01:00.727
said the bear.

01:02.009 --> 01:04.341
I bet you can't.

01:05.551 --> 01:06.681
said the fox.

01:07.762 --> 01:13.030
So the bear grabbed the rope, ran, and jumped.

01:14.055 --> 01:16.461
Snap, went the rope.

01:17.495 --> 01:19.119
Down went the bear.

01:20.207 --> 01:22.653
He did not swing on the rope.

01:23.663 --> 01:27.354
I bet I can sleep all winter.

01:28.453 --> 01:29.319
said the bear.

01:30.508 --> 01:32.719
I bet you can't.

01:33.873 --> 01:34.795
said the hawk.

01:35.845 --> 01:39.567
So the bear went into a cave.

01:40.495 --> 01:43.529
He curled up into a big ball.

01:47.421 --> 01:48.495
Went the bear.

01:49.567 --> 01:52.686
And he did sleep all winter.
