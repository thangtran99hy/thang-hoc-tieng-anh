00:03.596 --> 00:04.976
Let's sleep here.

00:05.393 --> 00:06.270
Spike said.

00:07.387 --> 00:09.442
Is that the farmer over there?

00:09.969 --> 00:10.972
Billy asked.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.406
I don't think so.

00:13.928 --> 00:14.931
Spike said.

00:16.036 --> 00:20.383
I think it's a scarecrow. But he does not scare me!

00:21.040 --> 00:21.837
Said Spike.

00:22.826 --> 00:26.058
That night, Spike did get scared.

00:26.937 --> 00:29.388
First, an arm moved.

00:30.116 --> 00:32.785
Spike hid under the corn.

00:33.761 --> 00:37.833
Then, both arms and the corn moved.

00:38.725 --> 00:41.152
Spike hid under the tractor.

00:42.043 --> 00:44.531
Spike, why are you hiding?

00:44.981 --> 00:46.046
Billy asked.

00:46.731 --> 00:48.897
I'm hiding from the farmer.

00:49.325 --> 00:50.266
Said Spike.

00:51.171 --> 00:55.703
Billy thought. He knew it was not a farmer.

00:56.605 --> 00:59.404
He knew it was a scarecrow.

01:00.238 --> 01:04.027
He thought about why the scarecrow moved.

01:04.830 --> 01:06.885
The wind stopped blowing.

01:07.876 --> 01:11.913
The corn and the scarecrow stopped moving.

01:12.733 --> 01:14.788
Everything was still.

01:15.564 --> 01:16.505
Billy said.

01:16.972 --> 01:22.371
Now I know. The wind moved the scarecrow and the corn.

01:22.692 --> 01:24.995
It is not the farmer moving.

01:25.421 --> 01:26.917
Billy said to Spike.

01:27.758 --> 01:31.175
It is the wind moving the scarecrow.

01:31.685 --> 01:32.563
Said Billy.

01:33.493 --> 01:35.053
Don't be scared.

01:35.940 --> 01:38.707
Oh, no! Silly me.

01:39.127 --> 01:40.171
Said Spike.
