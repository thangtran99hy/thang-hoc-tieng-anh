00:07.893 --> 00:09.167
Welcome to the jungle, my man.

00:09.503 --> 00:12.088
This is it, do-or-die, survival of the fittest.

00:12.447 --> 00:13.342
Afraid you're gonna blow it?

00:13.721 --> 00:14.299
Relax.

00:14.580 --> 00:18.073
Here are some fail-safe tactics that'll shoot you to the top of anybody's shortlist.

00:21.027 --> 00:26.419
You will need a professional looking outfit, a briefcase or portfolio,...

00:27.128 --> 00:30.390
...an up-to-date resume and a positive attitude.

00:32.243 --> 00:34.324
Step one. Do your research.

00:34.610 --> 00:39.207
Pour over the company's website, search for relevant news items about it and its major competitors,...

00:39.370 --> 00:41.906
...and catch up on the latest developments in your field.

00:45.057 --> 00:48.417
Look for connections between the company's needs and your skills.

00:48.729 --> 00:52.448
Be prepared to discuss how your accomplishments complement the company's goals.

00:53.933 --> 00:56.444
Step two. Arrive a few minutes early.

00:56.753 --> 00:58.974
At the very least, be right on time.

01:01.456 --> 01:05.494
Never arrive late for a job interview, that's just lame.

01:07.075 --> 01:10.858
Step three. Dress the part to give the visual impression that you belong.

01:11.460 --> 01:16.435
Not every interview requires a coat and tie, but you should always look neat and professional.

01:18.064 --> 01:21.535
Step four. Make nice with any employees you meet while waiting...

01:21.830 --> 01:23.988
...and always be nice to the receptionist.

01:26.678 --> 01:29.003
She's the eyes and ears of the company.

01:30.497 --> 01:34.545
Step five. Greet your interviewer with a firm, dry handshake.

01:35.021 --> 01:39.105
Don't give just a limp finger grab, don't go overboard and crush their hand,...

01:39.389 --> 01:41.151
...and don't try anything funny or clever.

01:42.303 --> 01:50.258
Step six. Make sure your resume and list of references are up-to-date, and bring extra copies of both.

01:51.331 --> 01:54.153
Step seven. Listen as much as you talk.

01:54.688 --> 01:59.251
Keep your answers on point and don't forget to ask questions as well as answer them.

02:01.551 --> 02:04.139
Did you quit your last job to play poker for a year?

02:04.578 --> 02:08.557
If so, be ready to explain why, you will be asked.

02:10.883 --> 02:13.530
Step eight. Put a positive spin on everything.

02:13.888 --> 02:15.766
Everyone wants to hire a team player,...

02:15.992 --> 02:20.175
...so resist the urge to complain about another job or badmouth a former employer.

02:20.769 --> 02:24.501
Step nine. Don't exaggerate your skills or your knowledge.

02:24.794 --> 02:29.540
Be straight about what you do and don't know, and offer to learn more if you get the job.

02:32.679 --> 02:36.949
Let your personality show, but save the theatrics for when you're hanging out with your friends.

02:38.480 --> 02:42.748
Step ten. Smile, nod and maintain eye contact.

02:43.049 --> 02:45.973
The proper body language conveys interest and engagement.

02:46.308 --> 02:47.193
No slouching.

02:50.907 --> 02:54.802
Step 11. Before you leave, ask about the next step in the process...

02:54.885 --> 02:57.130
...and the overall timeline for filling the position.

03:02.114 --> 03:05.023
Step 12. Don't forget to thank everyone on the way out.

03:05.539 --> 03:09.265
When you get home, mail a handwritten note to each person you spoke with.

03:12.713 --> 03:13.289
Did you know?

03:13.785 --> 03:18.649
Interviewers at Microsoft often asked job applicants why manhole covers are round,...

03:18.883 --> 03:20.884
...just to test how well they thought on their feet.
