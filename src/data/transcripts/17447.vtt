Do you know where Flora is?

00:04.570 --> 00:06.375
I think she is in her room.

00:06.809 --> 00:09.271
I heard her singing songs in her room.

00:10.621 --> 00:13.735
Please don't let her sing at home. It's noisy.

00:16.253 --> 00:17.865
Who is that tall boy?

00:19.216 --> 00:21.117
He is my cousin, Jeff.

00:22.268 --> 00:25.250
I saw him walk into your house yesterday.

00:26.443 --> 00:30.649
Oh, he smiles at you. Why don't you wave at him?

00:36.224 --> 00:39.447
Momma Dog, Momma Dog, what do you see?

00:39.793 --> 00:43.188
I see an eagle looking down at me.

00:43.772 --> 00:46.951
Puppy Dog, Puppy Dog, what do you see?

00:47.303 --> 00:50.743
I see a dragon breathing fire at me.

00:51.217 --> 00:54.378
Momma Dog, Momma Dog, what do you see?

00:54.817 --> 00:58.179
I see a snake slithering quickly at me.

00:58.801 --> 01:01.934
Puppy Dog, Puppy Dog, what do you see?

01:02.292 --> 01:05.774
I see a fox hunting eagles with me.
