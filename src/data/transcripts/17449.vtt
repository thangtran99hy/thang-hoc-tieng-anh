00:00.160 --> 00:02.993
Thousands of students are graduating every semester.

00:03.380 --> 00:04.999
But there are only so many jobs.

00:05.280 --> 00:06.745
What are employers looking for?

00:07.007 --> 00:09.187
Having a great attitude, a strong work ethic,...

00:09.512 --> 00:13.207
...great communication skills, enthusiasm, analytical skills,...

00:13.276 --> 00:17.750
...those are some of the top five skills that we've seen employers say are very important.

00:18.148 --> 00:20.555
You know what to do according to your personality.

00:20.865 --> 00:22.082
Here's what not to do.

00:23.295 --> 00:27.013
36 percent of employers think the number one mistake people make...

00:27.250 --> 00:29.370
...on an interview is talking too much.

00:29.709 --> 00:31.783
Be careful not to talk over the interviewer.

00:32.260 --> 00:34.145
The meeting should be a two-way conversation,...

00:34.313 --> 00:37.452
...and many people try to cover up their nervousness by rambling.

00:38.171 --> 00:41.747
Another common mistake people make is not doing their homework.

00:42.189 --> 00:46.113
You must learn as much as possible about the company prior to an interview.

00:46.510 --> 00:51.098
Otherwise, you will not be able to hold a well-informed discussion about the company.

00:51.667 --> 00:52.117
Hurry up!

00:52.510 --> 00:53.086
You are late.

00:53.426 --> 00:54.491
Your car broke down.

00:54.744 --> 00:56.365
The traffic is really bad.

00:56.503 --> 00:57.479
Your dog is sick.

00:57.655 --> 01:00.186
These are no excuses in the eyes of employers.

01:00.315 --> 01:04.219
If you are late for the interview, he can be sure you will be late for work.

01:05.179 --> 01:07.937
Don't start talking about money too soon into the interview.

01:08.300 --> 01:11.305
If the company sees you as someone who just wants the money...

01:11.440 --> 01:15.444
...and does not necessarily care about the job, you will be at a disadvantage.

01:16.409 --> 01:20.739
The way you dress can speak volumes to someone who's meeting you for the first time.

01:21.060 --> 01:24.705
Don't sabotage yourself by showing up to the interview like this.

01:25.253 --> 01:28.632
It wouldn't matter even if you're a professional inside.

01:29.246 --> 01:31.608
Stomach butterflies are to be expected,...

01:32.005 --> 01:35.487
...but you can reduce your stress level by avoiding the above mistakes.

01:35.896 --> 01:40.839
Be cool, calm and confident, and you will be on your way to success.
