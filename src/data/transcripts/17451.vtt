Hi everyone! I'm Brian Krueger with CollegeGrad.com and this is the Job Search Minute.

00:06.528 --> 00:09.703
Passion is the most important aspect of interviewing.

00:10.322 --> 00:13.176
Passion is how you can differentiate yourself.

00:14.109 --> 00:19.999
So how do you differentiate yourself when your competition is also passionate in their interviews?

00:20.666 --> 00:23.776
Simple, through your passionate examples.

00:24.593 --> 00:28.660
Passion is not just about how passionate you are in the interview.

00:29.183 --> 00:32.130
The real differentiator is your passion in your work.

00:32.673 --> 00:34.963
And it shows by your examples.

00:35.661 --> 00:39.129
Think about the times when you were truly firing on all cylinders.

00:39.604 --> 00:45.325
When you saved the day, when you delivered against all odds, that's true passion.

00:45.894 --> 00:48.552
And that's a truly passionate work example.

00:49.319 --> 00:53.599
So, think about those passionate examples in advance of your interview.

00:54.351 --> 00:59.639
That is how you will differentiate your passion and set you apart from the crowd.
