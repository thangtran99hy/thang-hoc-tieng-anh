00:02.881 --> 00:04.503
Counting to 100.

00:05.778 --> 00:08.033
Leticia walked into the kitchen.

00:08.966 --> 00:10.748
She washed her hands for dinner.

00:11.933 --> 00:13.094
"Where were you?"

00:13.876 --> 00:14.972
her mother asked.

00:15.801 --> 00:19.415
"I've been counting. I need 100 things,"

00:20.370 --> 00:21.496
Leticia said.

00:22.309 --> 00:24.646
"Why do you need 100 things?"

00:25.146 --> 00:26.241
her mother asked.

00:26.819 --> 00:34.523
"Tuesday is the 100th day of school. For a project, everyone needs to bring in 100 things,"

00:35.597 --> 00:36.630
Leticia said.

00:37.826 --> 00:40.313
"Your brother and I can help with your project,"

00:41.114 --> 00:42.091
her mother said.

00:43.591 --> 00:45.088
100 of Something.

00:46.411 --> 00:49.404
Leticia showed her family a large piece of paper.

00:50.543 --> 00:53.281
There were 100 squares drawn on the paper.

00:54.552 --> 00:59.283
"I have to glue 100 things into these 100 squares,"

01:00.404 --> 01:01.454
Leticia said.

01:02.127 --> 01:04.933
"Let's think. Do you read in school?"

01:06.034 --> 01:07.133
her mother asked.

01:07.917 --> 01:09.557
"We read every day,"

01:10.617 --> 01:11.625
Leticia said.

01:12.719 --> 01:14.247
Making Little Books.

01:15.515 --> 01:17.308
"What do you like about books?"

01:18.273 --> 01:19.346
her brother asked.

01:20.180 --> 01:21.395
Leticia smiled.

01:22.669 --> 01:27.183
"I like the covers. I like the titles. I like the stories."

01:28.509 --> 01:30.343
"We could make little books,"

01:31.554 --> 01:32.533
her brother said.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.271
Leticia wasn't sure.

01:36.469 --> 01:39.098
"If we made books, could I write in them?"

01:40.221 --> 01:43.813
"Of course. It's your project. We're just helpers,"

01:45.586 --> 01:46.509
her mother said.

01:47.522 --> 01:49.605
Leticia liked the sound of that.

01:50.656 --> 01:51.985
Secret Messages.

01:53.265 --> 01:56.138
Leticia and her family made the tiny books.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.985
Then, Leticia wrote little notes in the books.

02:01.239 --> 02:03.103
She had to write very small.

02:04.576 --> 02:08.883
When Leticia was done, she showed her project to her mother and brother.

02:10.320 --> 02:10.838
"Cool,"

02:11.311 --> 02:12.183
her brother said.

02:13.004 --> 02:14.735
"This is very creative,"

02:16.147 --> 02:17.101
her mother said.

02:18.377 --> 02:22.433
On the 100th day, everyone brought their projects to school.

02:23.487 --> 02:26.065
Leticia showed her project to the class.

02:27.141 --> 02:32.149
At the top, she had written 100 Reasons I Love to Come to School.

02:33.193 --> 02:35.606
The title made her friends want to know more.

02:36.516 --> 02:39.437
They began reading the words in the little books.

02:40.891 --> 02:42.239
The Special Project.

02:43.269 --> 02:48.011
"Look, Kate, this one says 'I like to see Kate smile,

02:49.541 --> 02:50.377
said Mia.

02:51.933 --> 02:54.833
Soon there was a crowd around Leticia's project.

02:56.185 --> 02:58.139
The teacher read the books out loud.

02:59.398 --> 03:01.287
The class clapped for every book.

03:02.541 --> 03:05.765
There was a book for every student in Leticia's grade.

03:06.863 --> 03:10.009
There was also a book for everyone who worked at the school.

03:11.108 --> 03:15.794
Leticia found a creative way to celebrate the 100th day of school.

03:17.039 --> 03:21.397
Her 100 reasons told 100 people why they were special.
