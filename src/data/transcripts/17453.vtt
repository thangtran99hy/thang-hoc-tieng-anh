00:02.707 --> 00:05.131
Thanksgiving was Maria's favorite holiday.

00:06.165 --> 00:07.995
Her whole family came to visit.

00:09.249 --> 00:11.883
And there was always lots of good food to eat.

00:13.175 --> 00:16.707
Maria's mom and grandmother made turkey and tamales.

00:18.075 --> 00:19.892
Aunt Carla brought the stuffing.

00:21.008 --> 00:23.034
Aunt Liz brought black beans.

00:24.265 --> 00:27.445
And Uncle Carlos brought sweet potato pie.

00:28.858 --> 00:30.868
After dinner, the women talked.

00:31.750 --> 00:33.092
The men watched football.

00:33.547 --> 00:35.083
And the kids played games.

00:36.356 --> 00:39.289
But this Thanksgiving, there was a snowstorm.

00:40.234 --> 00:41.614
Nobody could come.

00:43.198 --> 00:45.329
"Thanksgiving is ruined,"

00:46.860 --> 00:47.731
said Maria.

00:48.879 --> 00:51.211
Maria and her family went outside.

00:52.279 --> 00:54.117
They saw some of their neighbors.

00:55.666 --> 00:57.588
Their neighbors were unhappy, too.

00:59.202 --> 01:01.488
"I was going to go to my son's house,"

01:02.566 --> 01:03.615
said Mr. Lee.

01:04.788 --> 01:07.336
"I made sticky rice, but no turkey."

01:09.243 --> 01:11.954
"I was going to go to my sister's house,"

01:13.729 --> 01:15.217
said Mrs. Florio.

01:16.644 --> 01:21.101
"I made my special pasta and homemade bread. But no turkey."

01:22.520 --> 01:24.292
"I don't have turkey, either,"

01:25.577 --> 01:26.605
said Ms. White.

01:28.467 --> 01:32.667
"My mother was going to bring it. All I have is pumpkin pie."

01:33.923 --> 01:36.185
Suddenly Maria got an idea.

01:36.881 --> 01:39.287
She whispered her idea to her mom.

01:40.757 --> 01:42.535
"What a wonderful idea,"

01:44.045 --> 01:44.814
said Mom.

01:46.210 --> 01:47.583
"We have turkey,"

01:49.220 --> 01:50.786
Maria told the neighbors.

01:52.041 --> 01:55.065
"Please come to our home for Thanksgiving dinner,"

01:56.059 --> 01:56.808
said Mom.

01:57.833 --> 01:58.859
So they did.

01:59.879 --> 02:01.989
There was lots of good food to eat.

02:02.928 --> 02:07.941
Maria felt thankful for her family, for good food, and for good neighbors.
