00:02.725 --> 00:06.139
Darby the dog's birthday was just two days away.

00:07.365 --> 00:10.881
On Friday, Darby would be 15 years old.

00:11.773 --> 00:13.623
That is old for a dog.

00:14.906 --> 00:17.417
"What shall we plan for Darby's birthday?"

00:18.135 --> 00:18.995
asked Mia.

00:20.368 --> 00:24.097
"It is just two days away, and we haven't planned anything."

00:25.298 --> 00:27.262
"We'd better think of something fast,"

00:29.348 --> 00:30.178
said Mike.

00:31.361 --> 00:35.367
"Darby will be unhappy if we do nothing on his birthday.

00:36.304 --> 00:39.097
We always do something for Darby's birthday."

00:40.367 --> 00:41.713
"Shall we have a party?

00:42.787 --> 00:44.509
Shall we take him to the park?

00:45.246 --> 00:47.209
Shall we take him to the beach?"

00:48.020 --> 00:48.814
asked Mia.

00:49.699 --> 00:51.629
"Or shall we take him on a hike?

00:52.519 --> 00:56.750
It is a special birthday because Darby will be 15 years old."

00:57.752 --> 01:00.371
"We must plan a special party for Darby,"

01:01.429 --> 01:02.351
said Mike.

01:03.043 --> 01:06.317
"We have always had a party for Darby on his birthday.

01:06.701 --> 01:11.696
And he will be 15 years old. We have to plan a very special party."

01:12.854 --> 01:13.969
"Let's make a list,"

01:14.882 --> 01:15.693
said Mike.

01:16.114 --> 01:18.458
"Who shall we invite to Darby's party?

01:19.035 --> 01:20.564
What shall we have to eat?"

01:21.707 --> 01:23.589
"Where shall we have the party?

01:24.229 --> 01:26.050
What shall we do for fun?

01:27.009 --> 01:28.717
What games shall we play?"

01:29.804 --> 01:33.287
Mike and Mia planned a special party for Darby.

01:34.502 --> 01:36.973
They invited Darby's favorite friends.

01:37.917 --> 01:40.137
They planned Darby's favorite games.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.865
And they shopped for Darby's favorite food.

01:44.926 --> 01:47.931
But they did not know where to have the party.

01:49.285 --> 01:51.239
Mike and Mia went to the park.

01:52.731 --> 01:54.983
"Is this a good place for the party?"

01:55.890 --> 01:56.645
asked Mia.

01:57.683 --> 01:58.156
"No,"

01:59.275 --> 02:00.084
said Mike.

02:00.885 --> 02:02.191
"It is not special."

02:02.950 --> 02:04.197
They went to the beach.

02:05.108 --> 02:07.289
"Is this a good place for the party?"

02:08.151 --> 02:09.047
asked Mia.

02:10.011 --> 02:10.637
"No,"

02:11.696 --> 02:12.507
said Mike.

02:13.329 --> 02:14.586
"It is not special."

02:15.483 --> 02:16.905
They went to the woods.

02:17.969 --> 02:20.223
"Is this a good place for a party?"

02:21.493 --> 02:22.391
asked Mia.

02:23.331 --> 02:23.879
"No,"

02:24.449 --> 02:25.276
said Mike.

02:26.543 --> 02:27.783
"It is not special."

02:28.795 --> 02:30.196
They went to the mall.

02:31.117 --> 02:33.355
"Is this a good place for a party?"

02:34.547 --> 02:35.377
asked Mia.

02:36.786 --> 02:38.011
"Not for a dog,"

02:39.311 --> 02:40.165
said Mike.

02:41.656 --> 02:43.115
Soon it was Friday.

02:43.812 --> 02:46.365
It was the day of Darby's birthday party.

02:47.617 --> 02:49.450
Where did they have the party?

02:50.641 --> 02:52.355
At the zoo, of course.

02:53.164 --> 02:55.401
It was Darby's favorite place.

02:56.624 --> 02:59.187
Darby saw all of his zoo friends.

03:00.511 --> 03:02.095
And they all sang.

03:03.466 --> 03:06.239
"Happy Birthday to Darby."
