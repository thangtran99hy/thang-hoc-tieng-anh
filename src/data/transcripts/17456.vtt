00:02.643 --> 00:06.342
Wing went to Singapore to visit his Uncle Lee.

00:07.539 --> 00:08.997
Singapore was hot.

00:10.152 --> 00:12.543
Wing did not like to be hot.

00:13.713 --> 00:16.639
Uncle Lee liked to fish when it was hot.

00:17.782 --> 00:20.994
He took Wing to Bedok Jetty to fish.

00:22.049 --> 00:23.808
Wing had never fished.

00:24.913 --> 00:28.107
"I don't like fishing," said Wing.

00:29.213 --> 00:33.459
"How do you know if you have never tried?" asked Uncle Lee.

00:34.576 --> 00:37.398
"I just know," said Wing.

00:38.519 --> 00:41.559
"Will you try?" asked Uncle Lee.

00:42.748 --> 00:45.481
"Can you teach me?" asked Wing.

00:46.571 --> 00:49.245
"Yes," said Uncle Lee.

00:50.375 --> 00:52.867
Uncle Lee gave Wing a fishing pole.

00:53.927 --> 00:57.139
He showed Wing how to put a worm on the hook.

00:58.293 --> 01:01.361
Uncle Lee threw his line into the water.

01:02.457 --> 01:05.488
Wing threw his line into the water, too.

01:06.703 --> 01:09.894
Uncle Lee felt something pull on his line.

01:11.027 --> 01:13.503
Wing looked to see what it was.

01:14.520 --> 01:16.643
Uncle Lee had caught a fish.

01:17.801 --> 01:19.867
Wing wanted to catch a fish.

01:21.029 --> 01:23.520
Uncle Lee had caught five fish.

01:24.577 --> 01:26.665
Wing had not caught any.

01:27.705 --> 01:31.116
"I don't like fishing," said Wing.

01:32.244 --> 01:35.723
"You will catch a fish," said Uncle Lee.

01:36.799 --> 01:39.567
Wing felt something pull on his line.

01:40.687 --> 01:42.883
He looked to see what it was.

01:43.939 --> 01:45.802
He did not see a fish.

01:46.894 --> 01:49.615
Wing pulled his line out of the water.

01:50.791 --> 01:52.419
The worm was gone!

01:53.483 --> 01:56.586
Uncle Lee and Wing laughed together.

01:57.773 --> 02:01.147
"I want to try again," said Wing.

02:02.236 --> 02:05.084
Uncle Lee put a worm on Wing's hook.

02:06.183 --> 02:08.827
Wing threw his line into the water.

02:09.915 --> 02:12.499
He felt something pull on his line.

02:13.621 --> 02:16.616
Uncle Lee looked to see what it was.

02:17.629 --> 02:19.469
Wing had caught a fish.

02:20.645 --> 02:23.157
Wing had caught a big fish.

02:24.284 --> 02:28.175
"I like fishing in Singapore," said Wing.
