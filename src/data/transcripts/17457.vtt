00:02.744 --> 00:04.479
Denise is bored.

00:05.556 --> 00:10.125
It is winter vacation, and she is out of ideas of things to do.

00:12.221 --> 00:15.700
"I wish it would snow," she says.

00:16.840 --> 00:20.169
While Denise waits for snow, she does puzzles.

00:21.233 --> 00:22.759
She plays games.

00:23.790 --> 00:25.077
She reads books.

00:26.209 --> 00:29.878
One book she reads gives her a huge idea.

00:31.006 --> 00:33.974
She calls three neighborhood friends and says,

00:35.213 --> 00:38.032
"Come to my house today at two o'clock!"

00:39.161 --> 00:42.445
Denise lays a blanket on the floor for a stage.

00:43.553 --> 00:46.276
She gets a wooden spoon for a microphone.

00:47.324 --> 00:50.431
She gets markers and a big pad of paper.

00:51.483 --> 00:53.515
She also gets her CD player.

00:54.571 --> 00:56.143
Then she makes her game.

00:57.194 --> 01:01.131
She gets ten cards and writes a direction on each one.

01:02.178 --> 01:03.277
DING-DONG.

01:04.275 --> 01:08.542
Denise puts the cards in a box just as her friends arrive.

01:09.508 --> 01:13.165
"Ready to play Talent Show?" squeals Denise.

01:14.221 --> 01:17.177
Marcus pulls the first card from the box.

01:18.227 --> 01:21.246
"Dance to a song," he reads.

01:22.235 --> 01:25.395
The friends laugh and cheer as Marcus dances.

01:26.467 --> 01:29.049
All afternoon the friends play the game.

01:30.044 --> 01:34.098
They dance, sing, draw pictures, and tell stories.

01:35.112 --> 01:37.389
The friends are having so much fun.

01:38.369 --> 01:40.277
They don't see that it's snowing.
