00:02.549 --> 00:04.571
It is that time of year again.

00:05.586 --> 00:06.581
It is summer.

00:07.667 --> 00:10.674
And every summer I visit my grammy.

00:11.711 --> 00:13.124
Ana comes, too.

00:14.125 --> 00:16.168
Ana is my little sister.

00:17.226 --> 00:18.909
Some of my friends asked,

00:20.133 --> 00:22.045
"Why do you call her Grammy?"

00:23.003 --> 00:24.795
"Well," I said.

00:25.913 --> 00:29.160
"It's because she doesn't like to be called Grandma.

00:29.517 --> 00:32.739
When we ask her why, she just laughs."

00:33.803 --> 00:35.927
Our grammy is very cool.

00:37.136 --> 00:40.075
She does things most grammies don't do.

00:40.939 --> 00:42.834
She likes being silly.

00:43.815 --> 00:46.473
Sometimes we call her Silly Grammy.

00:47.455 --> 00:50.838
Ana and I were getting excited to visit Grammy.

00:51.883 --> 00:53.742
So I called her on the phone.

00:54.829 --> 00:59.377
Now I am going to share what Grammy said when I called her.

01:00.526 --> 01:04.467
Then you'll know just how cool our grammy really is!

01:05.520 --> 01:08.340
"I miss you!" said Grammy.

01:09.408 --> 01:12.165
"We miss you, too!" I said.

01:13.201 --> 01:19.072
"Come visit, and we will have a special vacation," said Grammy.

01:20.175 --> 01:22.684
"What will we do?" I asked.

01:23.771 --> 01:29.243
"You will get to see my new purple house," said Grammy.

01:30.245 --> 01:33.165
"We will do lots of fun things."

01:34.267 --> 01:37.061
"We will in-line skate in the park."

01:37.530 --> 01:42.029
We will make circles, figure eights, and curlicues."

01:42.974 --> 01:46.095
"We will put colored streamers on our bikes."

01:46.795 --> 01:50.239
"And then we will parade through town."

01:50.631 --> 01:55.709
"We will eat scrambled egg and pickle sandwiches in the park."

01:56.705 --> 02:00.060
"We will read scary stories to each other."

02:00.551 --> 02:05.507
"And we will put on funny plays for all the neighbors."

02:06.549 --> 02:09.331
"We will play in the ocean waves."

02:09.599 --> 02:14.522
"And we will gather shells to make castles in the sand."

02:15.527 --> 02:21.703
"We will jump on the trampoline and see if we can touch the sky."

02:22.714 --> 02:24.147
"And then," I said.

02:24.731 --> 02:30.083
"We'll take a long nap in the big hammock under the oak tree!"

02:31.167 --> 02:35.075
Just Ana, my cool grammy, and me!
