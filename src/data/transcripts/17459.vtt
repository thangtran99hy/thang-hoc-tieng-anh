00:02.560 --> 00:03.665
On the Bus.

00:04.830 --> 00:07.462
Marissa and her mother were riding the bus.

00:08.461 --> 00:10.874
They were on their way to Grandma's house.

00:11.912 --> 00:14.197
They had to sit in the back seats.

00:15.269 --> 00:17.778
Marissa didn't like the back seats.

00:18.809 --> 00:23.397
There was a law that black people had to sit at the back of the bus.

00:24.463 --> 00:26.719
Her mother said it was unfair.

00:27.789 --> 00:30.112
Some white people came on the bus.

00:31.324 --> 00:35.157
So some of the black people stood up and gave them their seats.

00:36.259 --> 00:38.641
That was another part of the law.

00:40.713 --> 00:42.194
Refusing to Stand.

00:43.201 --> 00:45.743
But one black woman didn't stand up.

00:46.697 --> 00:48.705
Her name was Rosa Parks.

00:49.680 --> 00:52.218
She didn't want to move from her seat.

00:53.306 --> 00:58.757
The driver told Rosa she had to move, but she said, "No."

00:59.866 --> 01:02.126
Then the driver called the police!

01:03.242 --> 01:06.321
The police came and arrested Rosa Parks.

01:07.407 --> 01:09.439
Marissa was very confused.

01:10.588 --> 01:12.621
Why didn't Rosa Parks get up?

01:13.678 --> 01:17.125
Everybody knew the law, even if it wasn't fair.

01:19.187 --> 01:20.401
Taking Steps.

01:21.399 --> 01:26.089
When other people heard what happened to Rosa, they got very upset.

01:27.225 --> 01:30.513
They decided to stop riding the city buses!

01:31.595 --> 01:34.897
Marissa asked her mom why they had to walk.

01:35.934 --> 01:41.317
Her mother said people stopped riding the buses to show that the law was unfair.

01:42.333 --> 01:45.469
For a long time they walked everywhere.

01:46.447 --> 01:49.655
Marissa's legs were sometimes very tired.

01:50.635 --> 01:53.341
Still, they didn't ride the bus.

01:55.391 --> 01:56.929
Making a Difference.

01:57.855 --> 02:01.251
Finally, an amazing thing happened.

02:02.288 --> 02:04.046
The law was changed!

02:05.117 --> 02:08.986
Marissa and her mom could now sit at the front of the bus.

02:10.043 --> 02:13.789
Marissa learned that one person could make a difference.

02:14.815 --> 02:18.739
She learned people could join together to change things.

02:19.762 --> 02:25.403
Today, people of all colors in the United States have the same rights.

02:26.429 --> 02:31.850
It all started with one woman saying no to something that was unfair.
