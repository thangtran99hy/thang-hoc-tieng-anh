00:05.726 --> 00:09.059
She is one of the longest reigning monarchs in the world.

00:09.240 --> 00:15.574
Welcome to WatchMojo.com, and today we'll be learning more about the life and accomplishments of Queen Elizabeth II.

00:16.271 --> 00:23.235
Elizabeth Alexandra Mary was born April 21st, 1926 in Mayfair, London into the House of Windsor.

00:23.727 --> 00:30.431
She was the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York, otherwise known as Prince Albert and Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon.

00:30.799 --> 00:36.813
In her youth, Elizabeth was not expected to become queen as her father was King George V's second son.

00:37.164 --> 00:43.899
The king died in 1936, and her uncle ascended to the throne. However, he famously abdicated for love.

00:44.242 --> 00:49.269
Elizabeth's father then became King George VI, and she became heiress presumptive.

00:49.627 --> 00:54.835
When World War II erupted in Europe, Elizabeth and her younger sister Margaret moved to Windsor Castle.

00:55.199 --> 01:01.994
From there, the 14-year-old future queen made a reassuring radio address directed at children who were affected by the war.

01:02.254 --> 01:13.942
"My sister Margaret Rose and I feel so much for you as we know from experience what it means to be away from those we love most of all."

01:14.233 --> 01:20.265
Elizabeth's public profile increased when she was named colonel-in-chief of the British Army's Grenadier Guards.

01:20.633 --> 01:25.669
Her first unaccompanied public appearance was a visit to the regiment in 1943.

01:26.122 --> 01:33.625
She also toured the country with her parents, and became Counsellor of State when the King was unavailable just before she turned 18.

01:34.105 --> 01:42.689
In 1945, she trained with the Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service as a driver and mechanic in an attempt to aid the war effort.

01:43.059 --> 01:48.908
Two years later, Elizabeth married Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark on November 20th at Westminster Abbey.

01:49.278 --> 01:54.835
The couple was labeled an odd one due to Elizabeth's subdued personality and Philip's outspokenness.

01:55.245 --> 02:00.084
Just one year later, Elizabeth gave birth to their first of four children, Prince Charles.

02:00.434 --> 02:02.621
Princess Anne was born in 1950.

02:02.964 --> 02:11.398
After a period of declining health, Elizabeth's father King George VI died February 6th, 1952 while the princess was visiting Kenya.

02:11.824 --> 02:14.598
She immediately became queen and returned home.

02:15.155 --> 02:19.241
Her official coronation took place on June 2nd, 1953.

02:19.577 --> 02:26.615
As Queen, Elizabeth's duties significantly increased: among her many responsibilities were weekly meetings with the prime minister,...

02:26.987 --> 02:31.377
...in addition to extensive travels throughout the United Kingdom and to other countries.

02:31.947 --> 02:35.336
Queen Elizabeth gave birth to two more children in the 1960s.

02:35.674 --> 02:39.675
Meanwhile, decolonization efforts developed in some British colonies.

02:39.967 --> 02:47.848
In 1969, Queen Elizabeth officially appointed Prince Charles as her successor by investing him as the Prince of Wales.

02:48.271 --> 02:54.127
Later, she celebrated 25 years as Queen in 1977 with her silver jubilee.

02:54.593 --> 02:58.930
While there was opposition to the Royal Family, in general its popularity soared.

02:59.271 --> 03:04.087
This was reinforced in 1981 when Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer.

03:04.435 --> 03:07.318
Unfortunately, the country soon faced conflict.

03:07.765 --> 03:13.405
1982's Falklands War even involved the Royals directly as Prince Andrew fought for Britain.

03:13.822 --> 03:20.410
In 2002, as she celebrated her golden jubilee, she also mourned the loss of both her sister and her mother.

03:20.891 --> 03:27.425
During that decade, the queen also began showing signs of aging, and adapted her position on various topics.

03:27.890 --> 03:32.515
For example, she finally approved of Prince Charles' relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles,...

03:32.941 --> 03:37.703
...and she became the first British monarch to visit Ireland since its independence.

03:38.425 --> 03:43.386
The monarchy was revived in 2011 by the wedding of Prince William to Catherine Middleton,...

03:43.743 --> 03:47.180
...and the queen was instrumental in helping her grandson plan the day.

03:47.502 --> 03:52.529
The next year, the queen observed her diamond jubilee, marking 60 years on the throne.

03:53.195 --> 03:57.575
Queen Elizabeth II was born into royalty and rose to the task valiantly.

03:58.033 --> 04:03.489
Her poise, grace and wisdom were her greatest assets, and were cornerstones of her rule.

04:03.725 --> 04:14.277
When I was 21, I pledged my life to the service of our people and I asked for God's help to make good that vow.

04:15.641 --> 04:26.757
Although that vow was made in my salad days when I was green in judgment, I do not regret nor retract one word of it.
