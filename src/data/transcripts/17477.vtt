While you're in an interview, remember that it's not only important...

00:06.379 --> 00:10.473
...that you answer your questions well but then you ask great questions.

00:10.829 --> 00:14.459
Hiring managers are looking for candidates that are engaged in their field...

00:14.866 --> 00:17.419
...and have taken the time to do research on their company.

00:18.310 --> 00:20.297
What is it about their company that attracts you?

00:20.767 --> 00:22.923
Why do you want to work there over the competition?

00:23.585 --> 00:28.646
Remember that the interview is the time to ask questions that will affect your ultimate decision.

00:29.406 --> 00:31.867
Find out what the demands and expectations are of the position.

00:32.591 --> 00:34.673
And don't forget to ask about the company culture.

00:35.439 --> 00:37.253
If you are a social butterfly at the office,...

00:37.369 --> 00:40.793
...you may want to know if the company has a lot of team building activities throughout the year.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.182
Is there a company softball team?

00:43.920 --> 00:45.892
Do the employees socialize after work hours...

00:46.571 --> 00:48.604
...or do most of them go straight home to their families?

00:48.869 --> 00:52.980
Depending on where you are in life, you may prefer certain social environments over others.

00:53.542 --> 00:57.914
Most importantly, prioritize your questions and try to avoid taking over the interview.

00:58.619 --> 01:00.546
Let the interviewer conduct the session,...

01:01.095 --> 01:03.725
...but be prepared when they ask you if you have any questions.

01:04.291 --> 01:08.339
Inquiring about key components of the job will help you make an informed decision...

01:08.712 --> 01:11.318
...on whether this company is a good fit for you,...

01:11.431 --> 01:14.811
...and will show the employer that you are serious about the position.
