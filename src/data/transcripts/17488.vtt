Hi, I'm Katie Roney.

00:01.805 --> 00:06.420
On behalf of Expert Village, we are talking about how to have a successful interview.

00:07.234 --> 00:11.547
Through the course of your interview, write things down on your resume,...

00:11.800 --> 00:17.522
...take notes maybe make a little list at the bottom or on the back of action items.

00:17.943 --> 00:22.031
Things that you and the potential employer are discussing such as,...

00:22.601 --> 00:26.229
..."Will they let you know what the benefits are?"

00:26.349 --> 00:28.912
Are they gonna get back to you on some piece of information?

00:29.212 --> 00:30.673
Take all of these down.

00:31.317 --> 00:34.737
At the very end of the interview, you can flip back to it and say,...

00:34.912 --> 00:39.254
..."Okay, just to follow up I want to make sure that we're on the same page."

00:39.439 --> 00:42.063
And it's fun to do this. As a candidate, it lets them know that...

00:43.283 --> 00:46.320
...you're summarizing, that you were listening, you're participating in the interview.

00:46.772 --> 00:52.172
So, go over anything that you discussed previously and make sure you ask them,...

00:52.557 --> 00:53.767
..."What are the next steps?

00:54.631 --> 00:58.669
Are you gonna call me or should I give you a call in the next couple of days?"

00:58.960 --> 01:01.047
Kinda feel them out and they'll probably let you know.

01:02.202 --> 01:04.010
That creates a sense of urgency on their part...

01:04.110 --> 01:06.508
...and they'll know that you're interested and ready to come back.

01:07.999 --> 01:10.780
Phil, is there anything else that you'll go over?

01:14.269 --> 01:17.701
I don't think so. I think you covered it all.

01:18.979 --> 01:20.618
No questions or...

01:20.881 --> 01:21.774
No, I don't think so.

01:22.481 --> 01:27.668
Okay, is there anything that you wanted to discuss at all?

01:28.273 --> 01:29.609
I think you covered everything.

01:30.139 --> 01:35.571
Okay, well that's good. Hopefully I answered all your questions.

01:36.508 --> 01:37.825
Okay, that was not good.

01:38.201 --> 01:41.753
Not to me. His body language, his response was,...

01:42.949 --> 01:45.475
"I actually don't care enough to ask you any questions...

01:45.604 --> 01:46.843
...and I'm really just ready to get out of here."

01:46.997 --> 01:50.315
So, be prepared and have your follow-up list.
