00:02.765 --> 00:04.835
Terrell was a fussy eater.

00:05.862 --> 00:08.195
He ate the same thing every day.

00:09.180 --> 00:12.196
He ate cereal and a banana for breakfast.

00:13.159 --> 00:16.560
He ate a peanut butter and grape jelly sandwich for lunch.

00:17.562 --> 00:20.345
He ate pasta with butter and cheese for dinner.

00:21.381 --> 00:24.678
But Terrell's eating habits were about to change.

00:25.756 --> 00:27.450
It happened one Thanksgiving.

00:28.485 --> 00:30.497
Terrell looked at all the food.

00:31.539 --> 00:34.755
He saw that there was no pasta with butter and cheese!

00:35.810 --> 00:39.314
The family started to pass the turkey and mashed potatoes.

00:40.376 --> 00:42.749
They passed the beans and baked apples.

00:43.823 --> 00:46.349
They passed the stuffing and sweet potatoes.

00:47.427 --> 00:50.488
"Grandma Kay.", Terrell said.

00:51.575 --> 00:56.083
"Do you have any pasta with butter and cheese?", he asked.

00:57.161 --> 00:59.575
"No.", she said.

01:00.593 --> 01:04.785
"I do have a gift for you.", she told him.

01:05.827 --> 01:10.600
"You must taste all the food to get it.", she said.

01:11.681 --> 01:14.135
Terrell didn't want to taste the food.

01:15.161 --> 01:16.591
But he did want a gift.

01:17.602 --> 01:19.340
He put some food in his mouth.

01:20.325 --> 01:22.784
Then, he tasted this food and that food.

01:23.847 --> 01:26.383
"Yum!", he shouted.

01:27.445 --> 01:33.398
"It looks like your taste buds are now awake.", said Grandma Kay.

01:34.418 --> 01:36.920
This is my gift to you!

01:37.911 --> 01:40.532
Terrell never forgot that Thanksgiving.

01:41.541 --> 01:44.653
Now his taste buds try everything.
