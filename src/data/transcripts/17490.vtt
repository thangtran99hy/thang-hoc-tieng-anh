00:02.629 --> 00:06.101
Day after day, the green grasshopper grazed.

00:07.151 --> 00:11.030
Most of the time, Grasshopper grazed on green leaves.

00:12.043 --> 00:14.421
Sometimes, he grazed on grass.

00:15.487 --> 00:19.679
But Grasshopper was tired of grazing on green leaves and grass.

00:20.653 --> 00:24.122
"I'm going to eat new food today," he said.

00:25.173 --> 00:27.330
Then, he hopped into the forest.

00:28.413 --> 00:32.495
Grasshopper grinned when he saw all the new food to eat.

00:33.596 --> 00:38.113
"Maybe these green berries will taste great," said Grasshopper.

00:39.185 --> 00:41.597
"Gross!" he groaned.

00:42.675 --> 00:45.392
He hopped to find something else to eat.

00:46.419 --> 00:51.142
"Maybe these gray nuts will taste great," said Grasshopper.

00:52.188 --> 00:55.384
"Gross!" he groaned, hopping on.

00:56.400 --> 01:00.863
"Maybe this sweet honey will taste great," said Grasshopper.

01:01.946 --> 01:04.031
"Gross!" he groaned.

01:05.111 --> 01:11.643
"I'm hopping home to graze on green leaves and grass," said the grumpy grasshopper.

01:12.695 --> 01:15.681
At home, Grasshopper greeted his friends.

01:16.711 --> 01:21.079
He said, "I just ate berries, nuts, and honey."

01:22.067 --> 01:25.501
"Those foods aren't great for grasshoppers like me.

01:25.869 --> 01:28.205
They're gross!" he said.

01:29.163 --> 01:31.893
His friends said, "Don't you know?

01:32.095 --> 01:36.548
Green leaves and grass are the greatest foods for grasshoppers."

01:37.643 --> 01:41.587
"Be glad you are a grasshopper!" they said.

01:42.779 --> 01:48.701
Now Grasshopper always grins as he grazes on green leaves and grass.
