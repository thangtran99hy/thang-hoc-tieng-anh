00:02.716 --> 00:04.991
There once was a very special boy.

00:06.078 --> 00:08.151
He was very, very hungry.

00:09.131 --> 00:13.049
He was so hungry that a bowl of alphabet soup wouldn't do.

00:14.131 --> 00:15.305
He pushed it away.

00:16.292 --> 00:17.557
No soup for him.

00:18.523 --> 00:19.956
He wanted more.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.934
This special boy wanted a special sandwich.

00:25.032 --> 00:28.546
Not some peanut butter and jiggly jelly jam sandwich.

00:29.659 --> 00:31.421
Not a little kid's sandwich.

00:32.510 --> 00:34.674
He wanted a grown-up sandwich.

00:35.739 --> 00:39.262
A gigantic, mountain high kind of sandwich.

00:40.344 --> 00:45.377
And so this boy closed his eyes and made a very special wish.

00:46.532 --> 00:49.024
He made a sandwich sandwish.

00:50.125 --> 00:54.369
First, he sandwished a loaf of bread hot from the oven.

00:55.475 --> 01:00.639
He cut off a slice so big. He had to use a saw instead of a knife.

01:01.685 --> 01:04.669
Cheese was next, but not just one kind.

01:05.716 --> 01:08.948
He wished for cheddar, Swiss, and Monterey jack.

01:09.970 --> 01:12.752
He wished for a big glob of cheese spread.

01:13.816 --> 01:19.104
Then he wished for meat roast beef, ham, chicken, and turkey.

01:20.186 --> 01:23.551
He had to stop in the middle and sandwish for a ladder.

01:24.593 --> 01:26.959
He climbed it to pile on more.

01:28.073 --> 01:31.929
He slapped on lettuce, a fresh tomato, and pickles.

01:33.010 --> 01:36.610
He added relish and a slice of eye-watering onion.

01:37.769 --> 01:40.716
Up and down the ladder of wishes he climbed.

01:41.788 --> 01:43.981
He piled on more and more.

01:44.891 --> 01:50.633
He finally had to sandwish a crane to drop on the last slice of bread.

01:51.632 --> 01:52.901
There it was!

01:53.973 --> 01:56.861
It was a mile high monster meal.

01:58.053 --> 02:03.093
It was a sandwished sandwich like no other sandwich wished for before.

02:04.159 --> 02:06.789
This special boy was ready to eat.

02:07.813 --> 02:09.528
But where could he start?

02:10.623 --> 02:14.799
He walked around and around, looking up and down.

02:15.825 --> 02:19.125
There was no way to start eating this sandwich.

02:20.235 --> 02:22.242
There was no way to end.

02:23.291 --> 02:27.259
The very special boy leaned up against the sandwich.

02:28.313 --> 02:32.619
He closed his eyes and made yet another sandwish.

02:33.759 --> 02:40.389
He wished for alphabet soup, please, and a sandwich of peanut butter and jiggly jelly jam.

02:41.489 --> 02:44.553
He ate it all and filled his tummy.

02:45.633 --> 02:49.789
He whispered softly, "Thanks. That was yummy.".
