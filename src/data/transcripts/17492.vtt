00:02.814 --> 00:04.337
It is Saturday morning.

00:05.368 --> 00:09.707
Erica and her dad ride bikes to the bakery every Saturday.

00:10.805 --> 00:13.589
Erica always gets a hot cinnamon bun.

00:14.731 --> 00:18.473
"Bye, Mom," Erica says as she runs out the door.

00:19.590 --> 00:22.079
"See you later," Mom says.

00:23.194 --> 00:26.828
Erica's dad waits at the end of the drive with his bike.

00:27.843 --> 00:31.807
Erica jumps on her bike, and they ride to the bakery.

00:32.913 --> 00:35.990
When they get there, Erica parks her bike.

00:37.065 --> 00:41.778
She runs inside and says, "I'll have my usual, Mr. Hoffman."

00:42.803 --> 00:45.793
"I'm so sorry," the baker says.

00:46.803 --> 00:49.811
"A lady just bought all the cinnamon buns."

00:50.895 --> 00:53.123
Erica runs out of the bakery.

00:54.137 --> 00:59.063
"Dad, someone bought all the cinnamon buns," she explains.

01:00.194 --> 01:04.853
"A lady with a big bag just came out of the bakery," says Dad.

01:05.903 --> 01:09.431
"She was wearing a polka-dot dress," says another man.

01:10.611 --> 01:14.286
"Does anyone know where she went?" asks Erica.

01:15.255 --> 01:19.662
"I saw her go down the street on a black scooter," says a boy.

01:20.773 --> 01:24.683
Erica and her dad ride after the lady on their bikes.

01:25.723 --> 01:29.207
Soon, they ride past a woman on the sidewalk.

01:30.293 --> 01:34.485
Erica asks, "Did you see a lady in a polka-dot dress?"

01:35.589 --> 01:38.764
"She turned right at the corner," the woman says.

01:39.822 --> 01:42.466
Erica and her dad turn right at the corner.

01:43.497 --> 01:46.445
They see a black scooter in front of the art center.

01:47.452 --> 01:49.204
They park their bikes next to it.

01:50.271 --> 01:53.341
They go inside and see a bag on a table.

01:54.392 --> 01:58.041
"That looks like a bag from the bakery," Erica says.

01:59.057 --> 02:01.489
"I think you're right," says Dad.

02:02.543 --> 02:03.769
The bag is empty.

02:04.808 --> 02:09.671
"We'll have to use our noses to find the cinnamon buns," Dad says.

02:10.723 --> 02:15.355
Erica smells the smell of cinnamon coming from a room down the hall.

02:16.403 --> 02:18.469
Erica walks into the room.

02:19.505 --> 02:24.224
"Hello, Erica," says Mrs. Garcia, the art center teacher.

02:25.283 --> 02:28.547
"Help yourself to a cinnamon bun," she says.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.773
"Then come help us paint."

02:32.783 --> 02:36.496
They had found the cinnamon buns, and Erica felt happy.
