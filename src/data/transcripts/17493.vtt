00:02.579 --> 00:05.517
Emily couldn't wait to get her math test back.

00:06.591 --> 00:10.145
She had studied hard and knew she had done well.

00:11.171 --> 00:16.310
Mrs. Meed handed back all the tests, but Emily didn't get her test.

00:17.376 --> 00:19.371
Joe didn't get his either.

00:20.461 --> 00:24.465
"I have two tests without names," Mrs. Meed said.

00:25.496 --> 00:27.390
"Do you know which test is yours?"

00:28.426 --> 00:30.669
Mrs. Meed asked Emily and Joe.

00:31.689 --> 00:33.810
Emily and Joe looked at the papers.

00:34.817 --> 00:39.311
One had one mistake, but the other had fifteen mistakes.

00:40.321 --> 00:42.963
Emily reached for the paper with one mistake.

00:43.989 --> 00:46.262
"This one is mine," she said.

00:47.307 --> 00:50.803
Joe said, "No, I think it's mine."

00:51.837 --> 00:54.911
"It looks like my writing," Emily said.

00:55.935 --> 00:59.126
"It looks like mine, too," Joe said.

01:00.118 --> 01:04.175
Emily stomped her foot and said, "I know it's mine!"

01:05.234 --> 01:08.367
"Your name isn't on it," Joe said.

01:09.361 --> 01:12.418
"Neither is yours," Emily said back.

01:13.394 --> 01:17.998
"There's only one thing to do since you can't decide," Mrs. Meed said.

01:18.951 --> 01:22.071
"What's that?" Emily and Joe asked.

01:23.103 --> 01:26.913
"You'll both have to take the test again," Mrs. Meed said.

01:27.905 --> 01:29.589
Emily and Joe groaned.

01:30.664 --> 01:35.577
"This time, please follow all the directions," Mrs. Meed said.

01:36.555 --> 01:39.235
"First, write your name on your paper.

01:40.251 --> 01:41.868
Then answer the questions.

01:42.934 --> 01:45.271
When you're finished, bring me your test."

01:46.349 --> 01:48.243
Emily thought the test was easy.

01:49.285 --> 01:51.261
She didn't miss any questions.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.802
Joe thought it was hard.

01:54.770 --> 01:56.517
He missed twelve questions.

01:57.559 --> 02:02.060
Emily said, "Next time, I'll put my name on my paper."

02:03.053 --> 02:07.344
And Joe said, "Next time, I'll study for the test."

02:08.429 --> 02:11.361
"I could help you study," Emily offered.

02:12.328 --> 02:14.517
"Would you?" Joe asked.

02:15.598 --> 02:18.205
"Then maybe I'll do as well as you."
