00:02.703 --> 00:06.019
Hey, sit down, and I'll tell you a story.

00:06.936 --> 00:08.216
My name is Arthur.

00:09.240 --> 00:12.905
I'm seven years old, and my life is great.

00:13.885 --> 00:17.485
Every morning Mom wakes me up by tickling my feet.

00:18.506 --> 00:21.721
It makes me laugh and starts my day on a happy note.

00:22.739 --> 00:26.781
For breakfast, Dad makes Mickey Mouse shaped pancakes.

00:27.808 --> 00:31.787
After school, Dad and I kick the ball until dinner.

00:32.706 --> 00:36.380
For dessert, I always have a huge cookie with milk.

00:37.387 --> 00:40.413
I have my own special cup from Disneyland.

00:41.340 --> 00:45.615
But a few months ago, my parents told me some bad news.

00:46.602 --> 00:49.204
They said that I'm going to have a little sister.

00:50.248 --> 00:52.555
I know I'm not going to like it.

00:53.482 --> 00:56.716
I have never had to share my parents with anybody.

00:57.740 --> 01:00.597
My friend Jeff got a baby sister last year.

01:01.605 --> 01:04.128
His parents never have time to play with him.

01:05.183 --> 01:10.407
And they are always busy changing the baby's stinky diapers! Yuck!

01:11.428 --> 01:15.819
Mom and Dad said that I will have to share my bedroom with the baby.

01:16.795 --> 01:19.763
She better not use my Disneyland cup.

01:20.686 --> 01:21.695
No way.

01:22.726 --> 01:25.834
I told Mom that I don't want a baby sister.

01:26.838 --> 01:28.437
But that didn't seem to matter.

01:29.437 --> 01:33.021
Today, Mom and Dad are coming home with my new sister.

01:34.055 --> 01:36.485
I'm just going to tell them to take her back.

01:37.445 --> 01:41.255
I don't want to share my mom and dad, or my room.

01:42.131 --> 01:44.039
Well, here they are.

01:45.063 --> 01:47.270
Dad is carrying some pink blankets.

01:48.311 --> 01:49.931
Is the baby inside there?

01:50.935 --> 01:52.283
Is she that small?

01:53.247 --> 01:54.698
Grandma goes outside.

01:55.690 --> 01:58.686
She hugs Mom and then looks inside the pink blankets.

01:59.711 --> 02:02.103
I hear Grandma say the baby is beautiful.

02:03.099 --> 02:04.597
I'm not going out there.

02:05.544 --> 02:07.240
I'm going to sit right here.

02:08.193 --> 02:09.702
Now Mom is hugging me.

02:10.687 --> 02:12.745
Dad puts the baby in my lap.

02:13.709 --> 02:16.627
And then, the most amazing thing happens.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.066
She reaches out and grabs my finger!

02:21.030 --> 02:22.497
She won't let go!

02:23.483 --> 02:25.693
I think she knows that I'm her big brother.

02:26.737 --> 02:28.269
She likes me already.

02:29.273 --> 02:32.488
Hey, maybe having a sister won't be so bad.

02:33.514 --> 02:36.765
I think Mom and Dad have enough love for both of us.
