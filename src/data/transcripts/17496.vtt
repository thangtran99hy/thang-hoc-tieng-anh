00:02.577 --> 00:05.542
Harry Hippo awoke early one morning.

00:06.515 --> 00:10.354
"OW!" he moaned.

00:11.323 --> 00:15.301
"I have a horrible, terrible toothache."

00:16.293 --> 00:18.341
Harry moaned and groaned.

00:19.391 --> 00:23.282
He moaned and groaned so loudly he woke everyone up.

00:24.299 --> 00:27.571
"What is wrong?" they asked.

00:28.661 --> 00:32.345
"Why is Harry moaning and groaning so loudly?"

00:33.346 --> 00:37.558
"Harry has a toothache," said his wife, Harriet.

00:38.611 --> 00:41.959
"What shall we do?" asked Polly the Parrot.

00:42.929 --> 00:47.167
"We will have to pull out the tooth," said Harriet.

00:48.181 --> 00:51.643
"But who will pull it out?" asked Polly.

00:52.649 --> 00:55.561
"I will," said Milly the Gorilla.

00:56.601 --> 01:00.879
"But how will you pull it out?" asked Ziggy the Lion.

01:01.949 --> 01:04.247
Milly went off to find a vine.

01:05.318 --> 01:09.341
She tied the vine to Harry's tooth, and she pulled on the vine.

01:10.380 --> 01:14.128
She pulled and pulled, but the tooth did not come out.

01:15.083 --> 01:17.730
"Let me help," said Ziggy.

01:18.772 --> 01:23.090
So Ziggy and Milly pulled, but the tooth did not come out.

01:24.084 --> 01:27.072
"What will we do now?" asked Polly.

01:28.115 --> 01:31.081
"I have an idea," said Milly.

01:32.031 --> 01:36.754
They took Harry to a cliff and tied the vine to a big rock.

01:37.867 --> 01:40.217
They pushed the rock over the cliff.

01:41.250 --> 01:43.579
But Harry's tooth did not come out.

01:44.631 --> 01:47.101
"Now what?" asked Ziggy.

01:48.155 --> 01:52.941
"I have a better idea," said Polly, and she flew off.

01:54.056 --> 01:57.216
Harry moaned and groaned even louder.

01:58.176 --> 02:01.577
Later, Polly came back with Ella the Elephant.

02:02.545 --> 02:06.730
"Ella will help us pull Harry's tooth," said Polly.

02:07.667 --> 02:09.677
They tied the vine to Ella.

02:10.659 --> 02:15.080
She pulled and pulled, but still the tooth did not come out.

02:16.171 --> 02:19.401
Then out of the jungle crept a mouse.

02:20.551 --> 02:24.895
Ella saw the mouse and took off running very fast.

02:25.987 --> 02:27.742
Out came Harry's tooth.

02:28.672 --> 02:31.183
Harry stopped moaning and groaning.

02:32.320 --> 02:35.047
Once again the jungle was quiet.

02:35.990 --> 02:39.809
Everyone was happy, especially Harry.
