00:01.543 --> 00:03.831
Today is a special day.

00:04.957 --> 00:06.935
Today is Mother's Day.

00:08.192 --> 00:11.763
I want to do something special for my mom.

00:13.143 --> 00:15.261
Dad and I wake up early.

00:16.635 --> 00:18.982
Dad and I sneak downstairs.

00:20.260 --> 00:23.652
Quietly, quietly, quietly.

00:25.059 --> 00:27.295
First we make her eggs.

00:28.613 --> 00:31.341
I help crack the eggs in the bowl.

00:32.593 --> 00:35.418
Scramble, scramble, scramble.

00:36.699 --> 00:38.627
Then we make her bacon.

00:39.933 --> 00:42.935
I help lay the bacon in the pan.

00:44.279 --> 00:46.611
Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle.

00:47.821 --> 00:49.843
Then we make her toast.

00:51.075 --> 00:53.808
I help put the bread in the toaster.

00:54.857 --> 00:56.691
Pop, pop, pop.

00:57.833 --> 00:59.635
Then we make her juice.

01:00.776 --> 01:02.763
I help pour the juice in a cup.

01:04.157 --> 01:06.259
Pour, pour, pour.

01:07.391 --> 01:09.559
Then we put it on a tray.

01:10.595 --> 01:14.929
I help decorate the tray with a flower and a card.

01:16.223 --> 01:18.361
Done, done, done.

01:19.545 --> 01:23.247
Dad and I sneak back upstairs to Mom's bed.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.891
I wake up Mom with a hug and a kiss.

01:29.103 --> 01:31.184
Dad hands Mom her breakfast.

01:32.433 --> 01:33.357
We both say.

01:33.673 --> 01:36.540
Happy Mother's Day! We love you!
