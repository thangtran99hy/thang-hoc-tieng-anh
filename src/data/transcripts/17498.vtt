Did you have lunch?

00:04.362 --> 00:05.828
Yes, I did.

00:07.013 --> 00:10.493
What did you have? Did you have something yummy?

00:11.678 --> 00:14.466
Sure. My mom made me spaghetti.

00:16.718 --> 00:17.717
What is that?

00:19.048 --> 00:23.284
It is a paper hat. I met someone kind on my way home.

00:23.627 --> 00:25.186
He made this hat for me.

00:26.398 --> 00:27.656
How nice!

Today is Mother's Day, Mother's Day.

00:36.637 --> 00:40.089
I want to do something special for my mom.

00:40.391 --> 00:43.861
Scramble, scramble, first we make her eggs.

00:44.148 --> 00:47.623
Sizzle, sizzle, then we make her bacon.

00:48.030 --> 00:51.351
Pop, pop, then we make her toast.

00:51.863 --> 00:55.309
Pour, pour, then we make her juice.

00:55.617 --> 00:58.783
Done, done, we put it on a tray.

00:59.132 --> 01:02.392
We say, "Happy Mother's Day! We love you!"
