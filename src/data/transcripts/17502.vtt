Hi, Bob.

00:03.358 --> 00:05.521
Hi, Cindy. How are you today?

00:06.918 --> 00:08.477
I'm so angry.

00:10.082 --> 00:11.864
What made you so angry?

00:13.333 --> 00:15.900
My brother broke my crayons.

00:16.390 --> 00:19.891
He always uses my crayons without asking.

00:20.325 --> 00:22.065
It makes me angry.

00:24.161 --> 00:27.927
Calm down. He is just a three-year-old baby.

00:33.657 --> 00:36.780
What, what, what, what do you need?

00:37.395 --> 00:40.599
Water, water, water, I need water to drink.

00:41.148 --> 00:44.499
What, what, what, what do you want?

00:44.855 --> 00:48.105
Pasta, pasta, pasta, I want pasta to eat.

00:48.643 --> 00:51.784
What, what, what, what do you need?

00:52.387 --> 00:55.628
Air, Air, Air, I need air to breathe.

00:56.143 --> 00:59.373
What, what, what, what do you want?

00:59.899 --> 01:03.567
Bike, bike, bike, I want a bike to get to school.
