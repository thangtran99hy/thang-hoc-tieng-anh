Hi everyone, I'm Brian Krueger with CollegeGrad.com and this is the Job Search Minute.

00:07.804 --> 00:10.716
Okay, you just had a great interview, now what?

00:11.492 --> 00:13.505
Step number 1: Thank yous.

00:13.929 --> 00:16.663
Request a business card from each person you meet with.

00:17.087 --> 00:20.367
Then send out an e-mail thank you within 24 hours.

00:21.173 --> 00:23.001
Did you forget to ask for a business card?

00:23.563 --> 00:26.868
Call your primary contact and ask for the e-mail address...

00:27.005 --> 00:29.892
...and correct spelling of the name of each interviewer.

00:30.520 --> 00:33.309
Step number 2: Letters of recommendation.

00:33.919 --> 00:35.767
If you did not provide them in the interview,...

00:35.951 --> 00:40.521
...send them out a day or two after the interview as reinforcement of your value.

00:41.383 --> 00:43.396
Step number 3: Follow up.

00:43.962 --> 00:47.997
You should have asked in the interview what the next steps would be and the timing.

00:48.490 --> 00:50.871
If you didn't, call your primary contact.

00:51.307 --> 00:55.365
Know the timing and make sure you follow up at the appropriate time.

00:56.296 --> 00:57.862
