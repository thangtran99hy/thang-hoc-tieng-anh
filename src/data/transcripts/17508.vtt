We've all seen variations on the list of common questions interviewers ask, but...

00:06.818 --> 00:11.251
...how much have you thought about what questions you should ask a potential employer?

00:12.163 --> 00:15.046
I'm Cat Miller and this is Dice TV.

00:22.764 --> 00:25.475
The best interviews are really conversations.

00:26.150 --> 00:29.640
The company wants to know if this is the right fit, and so do you.

00:30.341 --> 00:32.875
After all, work makes up a good portion of your life,...

00:32.999 --> 00:37.473
...so any organization or team you may join has to meet some of your basic needs.

00:38.140 --> 00:43.089
So, here are a few seed questions that can reveal aspects of the job and the company,...

00:43.361 --> 00:45.593
...you might not learn if you didn't ask.

00:47.059 --> 00:50.018
Why did the last person leave this position?

00:51.245 --> 00:54.706
The answer to that will tell you a lot about the company's dynamics.

00:55.119 --> 00:56.947
Is the job vacant due to a promotion?

00:57.533 --> 00:58.496
If so, great.

00:58.802 --> 01:00.454
That means there's room for advancement.

01:01.239 --> 01:02.567
Did the person get fired?

01:03.191 --> 01:05.563
If yes, you'll need to do some additional probing...

01:05.638 --> 01:09.173
...to figure out what caused the company to take such drastic action.

01:09.787 --> 01:11.099
Is this a new position?

01:11.525 --> 01:12.518
That would be great, too.

01:12.585 --> 01:17.125
It means growth, but you'll need to ask more questions to find out if it's SMART growth...

01:17.679 --> 01:20.719
...or the kind that will have you back on the street in three months.

01:22.198 --> 01:26.508
Can you describe what my first day, week, and month will look like?

01:27.621 --> 01:31.433
The answers here will tell you how far they've thought through your onboarding.

01:32.041 --> 01:36.478
Is it sink or swim, or do they have a reasonable plan with some mentoring?

01:37.009 --> 01:39.963
It can also give you clues about what to expect at first...

01:40.326 --> 01:44.014
...and what the company's manager's expectations are about your coming up to speed.

01:45.404 --> 01:49.105
Can you describe the ideal candidate for this position?

01:50.203 --> 01:55.384
This is a good one because it forces the interviewer to tell you exactly what they want.

01:55.890 --> 02:02.161
Then before you finish the interview, you can create a narrative starring you as that exact person.

02:03.348 --> 02:07.431
Also, make sure you hit the potential employer's website before the interview.

02:08.086 --> 02:11.484
That will usually help you come up with additional questions to ask.

02:12.137 --> 02:17.097
