Hey, I'm George Turnbull and I want to be your next employee.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.198
Now, you're asking yourself, "Who is this guy?"

00:09.701 --> 00:11.311
Let me tell you why I'm the man for the job.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.187
I've wanted to work since I was a little kid.

00:14.671 --> 00:17.929
I've got nowhere to go during the day and I'm not in it for the money.

00:18.783 --> 00:22.012
But if you think about it that's exactly why you should pay me more.

00:23.543 --> 00:26.220
To be the best, you need to stay one step ahead of the pack.

00:26.764 --> 00:30.751
Most people run in the morning but I run before bed just to keep my edge.

00:32.719 --> 00:35.383
To be great I think you need to know what it's like to win and lose,...

00:35.565 --> 00:37.574
...and this is why I play chess against myself.

00:39.845 --> 00:44.015
I'm reading the dictionary, typically in a decubital position by the fire.

00:44.783 --> 00:51.073
I feel like these cerebral calisthenics will prevent the deleterious declivity into mental decrepitude.

00:52.019 --> 00:52.895
I'm on the Ds.

00:54.101 --> 00:54.581
Checkmate!

00:55.941 --> 00:57.479
You decadent dastard!

00:59.800 --> 01:03.647
To succeed, you need to look the part and I'm like a chameleon.

01:03.892 --> 01:05.777
I can blend into any situation.

01:08.937 --> 01:09.669
Office parties.

01:10.198 --> 01:10.947
Casual Friday.

01:12.448 --> 01:13.145
Power lunches.

01:13.574 --> 01:14.986
Corporate events. Hey.

01:15.386 --> 01:19.839
If you're still not sure about hiring George Turnbull, just ask yourself this one question.

01:20.427 --> 01:22.363
Where do you see your company in five years?
