Mom, did you have a cell phone when you were young?

00:07.937 --> 00:09.088
No, I didn't.

00:09.575 --> 00:12.267
I didn't have a cell phone when I was young.

00:15.273 --> 00:18.206
You cried a lot when you were young.

00:19.145 --> 00:23.755
No joking! I was always happy when I was young.

00:24.807 --> 00:29.434
You did. And you also slept a lot when you were young.

00:32.411 --> 00:34.765
Did you go to see a movie last night?

00:35.923 --> 00:39.088
Yes, I did. It was a really good movie.

00:40.143 --> 00:43.396
Now, we can do whatever we want, right?

00:44.559 --> 00:48.333
Now, we can go to see a movie whenever we want to.

00:48.873 --> 00:52.331
But we didn't have a movie theater when I was young.
