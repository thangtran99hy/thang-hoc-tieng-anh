00:01.459 --> 00:02.940
Why have I had so many jobs?

00:04.760 --> 00:05.697
I get bored easily.

00:11.469 --> 00:13.685
So tell me, why do you want this job?

00:14.443 --> 00:15.806
Why do I want this job?

00:19.183 --> 00:22.155
What do you consider your greatest strength?

00:22.709 --> 00:25.777
My greatest strength is chilling with the coworkers.

00:26.526 --> 00:26.844
You know.

00:27.601 --> 00:28.262
Hold on, just a second.

00:30.501 --> 00:32.101
I don't want to do anything boring.

00:36.286 --> 00:37.872
There's no drug testing here, right?

00:41.893 --> 00:43.593
Man, I hop from job to job.

00:43.676 --> 00:45.853
As soon as it bored me, I'm gone.

00:47.735 --> 00:48.824
Why do I want this job?

00:50.823 --> 00:51.926
It's a good question.

00:55.059 --> 00:55.779
Yeah, I got nothing.

00:56.309 --> 00:57.493
What can I offer?

00:57.619 --> 00:58.248
That's a different...

00:58.857 --> 01:00.087
I could bring sexy back.

01:00.444 --> 01:00.638
Yeah.

01:01.892 --> 01:02.825
That was a good one, right?

01:03.223 --> 01:04.600
That was a good one, right? Yeah.

01:04.699 --> 01:04.910
Yeah.

01:05.253 --> 01:07.203
So, why should we hire you?

01:08.734 --> 01:12.331
I need some extra money to pay off some gambling debt.

01:13.425 --> 01:14.300
Do you really?

01:15.267 --> 01:17.245
Hey, how are you?

01:19.728 --> 01:21.356
Oh! That sounds great.
