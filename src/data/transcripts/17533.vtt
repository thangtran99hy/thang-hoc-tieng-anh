There are many things that can sabotage you at a job interview.

00:03.521 --> 00:05.580
A swearword tattooed across your knuckles,...

00:06.015 --> 00:08.497
...drunken karaoke videos on your MySpace page...

00:08.895 --> 00:10.536
...or having ever worked for hotnewz.

00:11.245 --> 00:11.866
Just kidding.

00:12.487 --> 00:15.767
But one you may not be aware of is your body language.

00:16.163 --> 00:19.533
Greg Hartley, author of Body Language Expert, explains.

00:20.242 --> 00:23.400
About 85% of everything you say is not with words.

00:23.718 --> 00:24.805
It's with the tone of your voice,...

00:25.044 --> 00:27.694
...with your body language, with how you sit, with the way you look at someone.

00:28.049 --> 00:30.293
When you go to a job interview, one of the first things to remember...

00:30.365 --> 00:32.672
...is the younger you are, the more energy you are liable to have.

00:33.063 --> 00:35.467
And that energy will lead through things called adaptors.

00:35.871 --> 00:41.027
For those of us who aren't up on our body language lingo, adaptors means fidgeting.

00:41.678 --> 00:46.320
You might pull your neck if it's a woman or if it's a guy you may wring your hands or rub your thighs...

00:46.541 --> 00:48.961
...and that's the release of energy that shows that you are uncomfortable.

00:49.198 --> 00:50.383
You need to learn to mask those.

00:50.805 --> 00:54.571
So remember, if you're squirming more than a two-year-old watching Seize band,...

00:54.981 --> 00:56.887
...they may not want you to manage the big account.
