Hi, I'm Dr. Lillian Glass.

00:02.211 --> 00:06.953
As a body language expert, a lot of people ask me, "What do I do with my hands?"

00:07.401 --> 00:08.643
"What do I do when I talk?"

00:09.150 --> 00:13.091
And I tell them, first of all, it depends on your culture.

00:13.397 --> 00:17.170
Because in certain cultures, using the hands is a very acceptable thing.

00:17.623 --> 00:19.796
But in other cultures, it may not be.

00:20.439 --> 00:22.959
But use of the hands is a good thing.

00:23.332 --> 00:27.438
Don't try to clasp your hands together because sometimes if you do that,...

00:27.537 --> 00:29.846
...you won't be able to express yourself fully.

00:30.161 --> 00:34.176
So you need to express yourself using your hands.

00:34.461 --> 00:35.480
Let yourself out.

00:35.793 --> 00:38.787
But make sure your gestures are not excessive.

00:39.213 --> 00:41.060
Make sure they match what you're saying.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.357
For example, if you are talking about something big,...

00:43.444 --> 00:45.350
...you want to show that with your hand movement.

00:45.610 --> 00:49.411
If you are talking about something small, you want to show that with your hand movement.

00:49.594 --> 00:54.810
So again use your hands for emphasis, and that way, it will make sense.

00:55.285 --> 00:57.935
