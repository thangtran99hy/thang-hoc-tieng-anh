Hi, Dave.

00:03.699 --> 00:06.207
Hi, Sally. What are you doing here?

00:07.755 --> 00:09.734
I am waiting for my dad.

00:10.731 --> 00:14.679
Are you? I have to wait for my dad to come here, too.

00:17.421 --> 00:19.599
What about going out for lunch, Kate?

00:21.266 --> 00:26.337
Oh, I can't. I have to wait for James to call me at home.

00:27.065 --> 00:29.187
How about ordering some pizza?

00:30.889 --> 00:35.486
Umm, I don't like pizza and Janice doesn't like it, either.

00:40.869 --> 00:44.352
Grandpa loves to fish and I love to fish.

00:44.649 --> 00:47.851
Grandpa goes fishing and I go fishing.

00:48.403 --> 00:54.839
Grandpa gets the worm and I get the fishing pole.

00:55.867 --> 01:01.963
Grandpa gets his pole ready and I get my pole ready.

01:03.395 --> 01:09.395
Grandpa puts a worm on my hook and on his hook.

01:10.867 --> 01:16.957
Grandpa and I toss the worms and hooks into the water.

01:18.376 --> 01:24.661
Grandpa and I wait and wait for the fish to bite.

01:25.810 --> 01:32.388
Yes! A fish bites my hook and I pull the fish in.
