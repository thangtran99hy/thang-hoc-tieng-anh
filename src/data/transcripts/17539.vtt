Maria likes to play baseball.

00:05.370 --> 00:08.171
She plays catch with her brother, Luis.

00:09.308 --> 00:13.806
The baseball coach asks Maria to join the baseball team.

00:15.037 --> 00:17.626
"We play at four o'clock on Tuesdays,"

00:18.587 --> 00:19.312
He says.

00:20.279 --> 00:23.173
"Mom, I really want to play,"

00:24.416 --> 00:25.553
Maria says.

00:26.543 --> 00:27.404
"Can I?"

00:28.635 --> 00:33.633
Maria's mom says yes, and they race home to tell her dad.

00:34.764 --> 00:39.856
Maria wears her baseball mitt to bed the night before her first game.

00:41.281 --> 00:45.644
She gets up to go to school, and her mitt is still on.

00:46.628 --> 00:50.121
At school, Amos gives Maria a note.

00:51.376 --> 00:55.057
The note asks her to come to his birthday party.

00:55.948 --> 00:58.795
"Oh, no! I can't come,"

00:59.650 --> 01:00.828
Maria says.

01:01.871 --> 01:04.377
"I have a big game that day."

01:05.279 --> 01:08.379
"Maybe I could come to your party instead."

01:10.116 --> 01:12.869
Maria asks the coach that night.

01:13.947 --> 01:15.393
"You can miss the game,"

01:16.157 --> 01:16.735
He says.

01:17.873 --> 01:20.619
"But the team will not have a shortstop."

01:22.726 --> 01:24.747
"I should not miss the game,"

01:25.759 --> 01:26.937
Maria says.

01:28.532 --> 01:30.191
"The team needs me."

01:31.611 --> 01:33.859
It is the day of the big game.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.531
All of Maria's family comes to watch.

01:38.581 --> 01:42.937
After the game, Amos comes to give Maria a balloon.

01:44.075 --> 01:46.093
He brings her cake, too!
