Hi, Sarah. How are you?

00:07.015 --> 00:08.299
I'm so happy.

00:09.006 --> 00:11.616
My mom bought me a notebook yesterday.

00:12.404 --> 00:14.592
Wow. Show me the new notebook.

00:16.731 --> 00:19.005
Oh, I left it at home.

00:19.641 --> 00:23.175
I'll bring it to school and show it to you tomorrow.

00:24.449 --> 00:26.387
OK. Don't forget to bring it.

00:27.587 --> 00:28.736
Never ever!

00:29.321 --> 00:31.975
Anyway, how was your weekend, Daniel?

00:32.949 --> 00:34.544
Umm, not so good.

00:35.011 --> 00:37.102
Dad took us to a Chinese restaurant.

00:37.409 --> 00:39.260
The noodles we had were terrible.
