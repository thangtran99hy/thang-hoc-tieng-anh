Who is the boy who helped you with the books?

00:06.913 --> 00:08.314
He is my brother Dave.

00:08.737 --> 00:11.255
He always helps me carry heavy things.

00:13.852 --> 00:15.484
How do you like your soup?

00:16.403 --> 00:18.279
This soup is so yummy!

00:19.451 --> 00:21.604
Dad helped me make this soup.

00:22.642 --> 00:27.007
Did he? I can't believe it! He never helps me with cooking.

00:29.804 --> 00:33.224
I can't solve this problem which is very difficult.

00:34.309 --> 00:38.324
Let me see. I can help you with math problems.

00:39.645 --> 00:40.497
Thanks, Jeff.
