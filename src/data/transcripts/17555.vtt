I don't know where to have a birthday party for Sam.

00:07.647 --> 00:10.579
You had better ask him where he wants to go.

00:11.482 --> 00:13.005
That's a good idea.

00:15.636 --> 00:19.197
Do you know what we should eat to celebrate Thanksgiving?

00:20.574 --> 00:22.067
I don't know what to eat.

00:22.473 --> 00:25.803
We'd better ask mom. She knows everything!

00:26.836 --> 00:30.142
No way. We'd better not bother her now.

00:30.564 --> 00:33.906
She is busy taking care of the twin babies.

00:36.815 --> 00:38.561
Mom, can I play outside?

00:39.789 --> 00:43.247
No, you'd better not play outside after 7.

00:43.779 --> 00:46.360
You can watch cartoons on TV instead.
