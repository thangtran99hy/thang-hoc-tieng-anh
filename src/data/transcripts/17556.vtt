00:02.633 --> 00:04.855
I climbed the mountain yesterday.

00:06.467 --> 00:08.393
Did you have a good time there?

00:09.359 --> 00:09.998
Yes.

00:10.513 --> 00:13.671
There were so many clouds above the mountain.

00:14.364 --> 00:16.217
What did you do yesterday?

00:17.685 --> 00:20.330
I went to the river and caught fish.

00:21.063 --> 00:23.929
There was a small bridge over the river.

00:24.535 --> 00:26.940
And there were many ducks on the river.

00:28.313 --> 00:28.956
Wow.

00:29.391 --> 00:30.903
I want to go there.

00:36.965 --> 00:40.605
Polly got out of her cage and flew out the door.

00:40.725 --> 00:44.172
What did she fly over and what did she see?

00:44.421 --> 00:47.835
She saw some houses when she flew over the trees.

00:48.189 --> 00:51.435
She saw a path when she flew over the houses.

00:51.938 --> 00:55.129
She saw a pond when she flew over the path.

00:55.683 --> 00:58.928
She saw a playground when she flew over the pond.

00:59.369 --> 01:02.797
She saw some flowers when she flew over the playground.

01:03.166 --> 01:05.817
Now Polly flew into her cage.

01:06.945 --> 01:09.241
Phew, she was safe.
