00:02.982 --> 00:05.303
I can't find my cell phone.

00:06.989 --> 00:08.802
Did you look under the table?

00:10.437 --> 00:11.240
I did.

00:11.533 --> 00:12.686
It wasn't there.

00:13.448 --> 00:16.765
Oh, my cell phone is under the sofa!

00:20.000 --> 00:21.911
I can't find my kids.

00:24.102 --> 00:26.503
I saw them playing below the deck.

00:27.991 --> 00:29.696
Oh, thanks a lot.

00:32.786 --> 00:33.668
Oh, no!

00:34.177 --> 00:36.827
There is a roach beneath the table.

00:38.595 --> 00:38.923
What?

00:39.307 --> 00:40.435
I hate roaches.

00:40.809 --> 00:42.666
Let's get out of this room.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.110
Lily walked through the door.

00:51.291 --> 00:52.551
What did Lily see?

00:52.961 --> 00:56.339
A room, a room, she saw a room.

00:56.879 --> 00:58.732
Lily crossed the room.

00:58.816 --> 00:59.997
What did Lily see?

01:00.428 --> 01:03.847
A chair, a chair, she saw a chair.

01:04.346 --> 01:06.168
Lily circled the chair.

01:06.279 --> 01:07.544
What did Lily see?

01:07.929 --> 01:11.349
A table, a table, she saw a table.

01:11.909 --> 01:13.684
Lily jumped up on the couch.

01:13.793 --> 01:15.047
What did she do?

01:15.575 --> 01:18.850
She curled up and took a nap!
