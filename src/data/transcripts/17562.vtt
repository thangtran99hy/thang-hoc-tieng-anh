Part of preparing for a job interview...

00:07.919 --> 00:11.331
...is to make sure you look like you would be a good addition to your prospective company.

00:11.881 --> 00:15.732
Monster is here to help with the ultimate guide on what to wear to a job interview.

00:19.821 --> 00:22.809
Think about the company and the industry you're hoping to work in.

00:23.166 --> 00:25.596
Is it a casual or a more formal environment?

00:26.583 --> 00:29.810
There's no shame in phoning up the HR department to ask about dress code.

00:30.269 --> 00:32.887
It's a good idea to dress as if you're already part of the team.

00:36.653 --> 00:41.891
Dressing the part alone won't get you the job regardless of how clean your shirt or shiny your shoes.

00:42.563 --> 00:46.384
However, it could put the employer off if you fail to follow some basic rules.

00:50.843 --> 00:53.422
Most importantly, don't dress too casually.

00:53.707 --> 00:56.747
Stay away from tracksuits, trainers and t-shirts.

00:57.851 --> 01:01.579
A smart pair of trousers and a shirt are the absolute minimum expected of you.

01:02.593 --> 01:04.967
Women should be wary of showing too much flesh.

01:05.303 --> 01:08.531
Your cleavage and midriff have no place in the interview room.

01:09.664 --> 01:12.267
You should be relying on your other assets to get you the job.

01:13.159 --> 01:14.469
Careful when it comes to headgear.

01:14.844 --> 01:17.019
Hats can make you look like you have something to hide.

01:18.285 --> 01:21.679
And be wary of too many accessories as these can be a distraction.
