There are lots of things that regular people can do but dads can't.

00:08.933 --> 00:12.905
Dads can't pitch a baseball very hard or hit one very far.

00:14.495 --> 00:19.309
When dads play hide-and-seek they always get found, but they have a hard time finding you.

00:20.805 --> 00:22.305
They aren't very good wrestlers.

00:22.935 --> 00:26.281
Dads lose at checkers and cards and almost every other game.

00:27.991 --> 00:30.843
Dads like to go fishing but they don't like to go alone.

00:31.321 --> 00:33.809
And they need extra practice baiting the hook.

00:35.221 --> 00:37.827
Dads don't seem to be able to drive very fast.

00:38.957 --> 00:41.381
Dads seem to have trouble holding on to their money.

00:43.609 --> 00:48.080
Dads can't see you hiding your lima beans at dinnertime or feeding them to the cat.

00:49.675 --> 00:53.066
Dads like to give baths but they can't help getting all wet.

00:54.708 --> 00:56.690
Dads can't read a book by themselves.

00:57.203 --> 01:00.113
And dads really need to be kissed good night at bedtime.

01:02.643 --> 01:06.553
There are so many things dads can't do, it's a wonder they make it through life at all!

01:07.159 --> 01:08.767
But dads can't give up.

01:09.108 --> 01:14.494
No matter how tired a dad gets or how hard life gets, a dad never quits.

01:15.444 --> 01:16.072
Thanks, Dad!

01:17.325 --> 01:18.317
Happy Father's Day!
