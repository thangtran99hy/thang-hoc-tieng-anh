How to answer the question "Tell me about yourself."

00:06.595 --> 00:10.031
Job interviews can be intimidating and open-ended questions like...

00:10.347 --> 00:12.667
..."tell me about yourself" make it even scarier.

00:12.908 --> 00:17.449
Give an answer that will impress your interviewers and set your interview off on the right foot.

00:18.029 --> 00:21.511
You will need the job description and your resume.

00:22.530 --> 00:25.587
Step one: Carefully read over the job description...

00:25.717 --> 00:28.549
...and make note of important keywords that will help you learn more about...

00:28.619 --> 00:30.154
...what the employers are looking for.

00:30.450 --> 00:33.855
Step two: Prepare for this question in advance of the interview.

00:34.172 --> 00:37.834
Review your resume and make a list of at least five or six words...

00:37.898 --> 00:39.729
...that define your professional strengths.

00:39.967 --> 00:43.188
Step three: Think of a professional success you have had,...

00:43.359 --> 00:47.541
...where you've helped solve a problem or added value to a former employer's project.

00:47.830 --> 00:52.723
Step four: Write out a 30-second response to the question "Tell me about yourself"...

00:52.971 --> 00:56.997
...that combines your professional strengths and discusses a past professional success.

00:57.301 --> 01:01.074
Never complain about current or former employers during your job interview.

01:01.233 --> 01:05.470
Step five: Focus your response on positive professional experiences.

01:05.641 --> 01:09.727
Don't talk about personal information like marriage, children or pets.

01:10.253 --> 01:14.323
Step six: Practice your response until you can remember the main points.

01:14.559 --> 01:17.269
Focus on sounding natural and conversational.

01:17.530 --> 01:21.037
Prepare a list of questions about the job that you want to ask during the interview.

01:21.207 --> 01:25.247
Show the employer that you've done research on the organization and have thought about the job.

01:25.983 --> 01:28.715
Step seven: Arrive at the interview prepared,...

01:28.961 --> 01:33.719
...giving an answer that is concise and truthful when the interviewers ask you to tell them about yourself.

01:34.391 --> 01:38.272
Let your professional strengths shine and set the stage for a successful interview,...

01:38.419 --> 01:39.464
...and maybe a new job.

01:40.069 --> 01:40.826
Did you know?

01:40.972 --> 01:43.855
According to estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics,...

01:44.151 --> 01:49.259
...half of the top 20 fastest growing occupations in the US are related to the health care industry.
