How's the weather today, Mom?

00:04.587 --> 00:05.623
It's rainy.

00:06.054 --> 00:08.321
Put on your raincoat and rain boots.

00:09.445 --> 00:10.630
Okay, Mom.

00:13.803 --> 00:16.105
Can I put on my pink dress today?

00:17.150 --> 00:20.569
No, you'd better put on your jacket and pants.

00:21.619 --> 00:23.870
It's cold and windy outside.

00:24.981 --> 00:27.895
Then I'll put on my dress and a warm coat.

00:34.341 --> 00:39.482
How, how, how, how does a clown put on a face?

00:41.849 --> 00:46.993
First, she puts on white face paint, white face paint.

00:49.257 --> 00:53.804
Next, she paints around her mouth and paints her eyelids.

00:56.763 --> 01:03.137
Next, she puts on big eyebrows, and paints big circles on her cheeks.

01:04.275 --> 01:09.499
Next, she puts on her red nose. It honks if you squeeze it.

01:11.839 --> 01:17.398
After putting on a red nose, she puts on a silly wig.

01:19.352 --> 01:25.056
Then she puts on a polka-dot jacket, striped pants, floppy shoes.

01:26.762 --> 01:30.310
Now, it is time to make kids laugh!
