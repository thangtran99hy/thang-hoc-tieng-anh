My grandma gets weaker and weaker as she gets old.

00:08.480 --> 00:09.988
Sorry to hear that.

00:10.289 --> 00:12.015
I wish she would be healthier.

00:15.131 --> 00:16.945
I wish I were a bird.

00:18.050 --> 00:19.785
A bird? Why?

00:20.876 --> 00:25.157
I want to fly in the sky just as a bird does.

00:26.290 --> 00:28.876
You can't as you don't have wings.

00:31.939 --> 00:36.708
My dad always comes home from work just as I fall asleep.

00:37.217 --> 00:39.199
I wish he came earlier.

00:40.352 --> 00:43.381
Umm. He must be busy all the time.
