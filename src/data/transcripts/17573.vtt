I met Sam on my way home yesterday.

00:06.949 --> 00:08.589
What was he doing then?

00:09.652 --> 00:12.157
He was walking his dog in the park.

00:15.369 --> 00:17.504
What were you doing when I called you?

00:18.619 --> 00:20.701
I was doing my art homework.

00:21.811 --> 00:24.349
Was your brother doing his homework, too?

00:25.403 --> 00:29.479
No, he wasn't doing his homework. He was watching TV.

00:32.575 --> 00:35.213
We saw your mom on our way to school.

00:36.314 --> 00:37.705
What was she doing?

00:38.807 --> 00:41.661
She was waiting for a bus at the bus stop.
