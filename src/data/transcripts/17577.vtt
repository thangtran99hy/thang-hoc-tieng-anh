00:02.835 --> 00:04.658
How's the weather today, Mom?

00:05.817 --> 00:08.378
It is very cold and windy outside.

00:10.567 --> 00:13.646
I'd better put on a warm coat and pants.

00:16.792 --> 00:20.033
Oops, I can't get into this dress.

00:21.064 --> 00:23.846
You gained some weight during the vacation.

00:24.949 --> 00:25.779
You're right.

00:26.115 --> 00:28.104
I need to go on a diet.

00:31.227 --> 00:32.535
Where is your sister?

00:33.655 --> 00:35.501
She is next to the door.

00:35.929 --> 00:38.250
She is wearing a green sweater.

00:45.919 --> 00:48.922
The bear was cold, cold, very cold.

00:49.738 --> 00:53.817
Squish, squash, squeeze, he got into the warm mitten.

00:57.204 --> 01:00.201
The fox was cold, cold, very cold.

01:01.017 --> 01:05.475
Squish, squash, squeeze, he got into the mitten with the bear.

01:08.409 --> 01:11.400
The rabbit was cold, cold, very cold.

01:12.233 --> 01:16.511
Squish, squash, squeeze, she got into the warm mitten.

01:17.803 --> 01:20.755
The blue jay was cold, cold, very cold.

01:21.573 --> 01:26.909
Squish, squash, squeeze, he got into the mitten after the rabbit.
