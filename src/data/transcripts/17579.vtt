00:02.892 --> 00:04.702
Winter is almost here.

00:05.439 --> 00:08.695
The day gets shorter and the night gets longer.

00:09.865 --> 00:10.535
Right.

00:10.805 --> 00:12.723
And the weather is getting colder.

00:15.866 --> 00:18.019
It is time to go back home.

00:18.350 --> 00:18.867
Hurry up.

00:19.958 --> 00:21.421
What time is it now?

00:22.451 --> 00:23.578
It's six thirty.

00:23.957 --> 00:25.127
It gets dark.

00:28.379 --> 00:30.380
The snowflakes get bigger.

00:30.860 --> 00:32.811
Let's go out and make a snowman.

00:33.897 --> 00:35.345
That's a good idea!

00:42.893 --> 00:49.197
Dark clouds begin to gather, they get darker and darker.

00:50.188 --> 00:53.821
A storm is coming, coming, coming.

00:57.713 --> 01:04.194
Strong winds begin to blow and the sky gets darker.

01:05.403 --> 01:11.613
Clouds move over the house and lightning flashes all around.

01:12.947 --> 01:19.446
Thunder crashes loudly, and the rain begins to fall, fall, fall.

01:20.171 --> 01:26.447
The rain falls, falls, falls and the winds blow, blow, blow.

01:27.833 --> 01:34.064
Then, the rain stops falling and the winds stop blowing.

01:35.191 --> 01:40.050
The sun comes out and Tim and Pam come out, too.
