00:03.004 --> 00:04.997
Giraffe was very hungry.

00:06.091 --> 00:07.972
I don't want to eat leaves.

00:08.663 --> 00:09.395
He said.

00:10.529 --> 00:12.397
I always eat leaves.

00:13.488 --> 00:16.445
Giraffe tried eating grass just like a deer.

00:17.467 --> 00:19.201
But bending down hurt his neck.

00:20.251 --> 00:23.297
Giraffe tried to eat ants just like an anteater.

00:24.457 --> 00:26.159

00:27.225 --> 00:29.900

00:30.984 --> 00:32.800

00:33.860 --> 00:37.103
Giraffe tried to eat fish just like an otter.

00:38.221 --> 00:41.255

00:42.402 --> 00:45.720
Giraffe tried eating bugs just like a frog.

00:54.377 --> 00:57.391

00:58.533 --> 01:00.201
Giraffe was still hungry.

01:01.303 --> 01:04.617
He bit into the green leaves hanging from the tree.

01:05.622 --> 01:07.030

01:07.586 --> 01:08.366
He said.

01:09.454 --> 01:11.781
Leaves are the best food.
