00:02.666 --> 00:04.845
I try to jump rope every day.

00:05.586 --> 00:08.323
I believe that it will help me grow faster.

00:09.360 --> 00:11.037
You are tall enough.

00:14.127 --> 00:16.345
I want to know a lot about space.

00:17.027 --> 00:19.494
How many science books do we have?

00:20.664 --> 00:21.479
Don't worry.

00:21.618 --> 00:22.989
We have enough books.

00:26.146 --> 00:28.268
Bill tries to run faster.

00:28.738 --> 00:30.802
He wants to be the fastest!

00:31.915 --> 00:33.561
He runs fast enough.

00:33.947 --> 00:37.227
He runs 100 meters within 11 seconds.

00:45.323 --> 00:51.692
Giraffe was very hungry, but doesn't want to eat leaves.

00:52.727 --> 00:56.523
He tried to eat ants just like an anteater.

01:00.277 --> 01:03.875
But ants bit his tongue, ouch, ouch, ouch!

01:04.039 --> 01:07.428
He tried eating honey just like a bear.

01:07.755 --> 01:11.227
But bees stung his nose, ouch, ouch, ouch!

01:11.529 --> 01:15.137
He tried to eat fish just like an otter.

01:15.483 --> 01:20.255
But he fell in the water and got very wet, oops!

01:22.893 --> 01:28.938
Finally, he bit into the leaves hanging from the tree, yum, yum, yum!
