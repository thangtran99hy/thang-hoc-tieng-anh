00:02.147 --> 00:04.637
My dad makes time for me, even when he's busy.

00:05.631 --> 00:07.047
Our dad takes us camping...

00:07.501 --> 00:09.062
...and he lets us set up the tent.

00:10.114 --> 00:12.471
My favorite date is going to the park.

00:13.870 --> 00:15.169
He teaches me about life.

00:16.919 --> 00:18.874
My dad lets me be his helper.

00:19.954 --> 00:22.250
He's not just my dad, he's my friend.

00:23.480 --> 00:24.609
I think I have a great dad.

00:25.029 --> 00:29.884
This Father's Day, Scheels encourages you to think about and thank all the special dads in your life.
