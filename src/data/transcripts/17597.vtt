I like to learn about things.

00:05.347 --> 00:07.191
How do I learn about things?

00:08.295 --> 00:10.105
I use my five senses.

00:11.226 --> 00:13.155
I use my eyes to see.

00:14.295 --> 00:15.998
I see birds and bees.

00:17.105 --> 00:19.040
I use my ears to hear.

00:20.164 --> 00:21.807
I hear birds singing.

00:22.915 --> 00:24.631
I hear bees buzzing.

00:25.751 --> 00:27.803
I use my nose to smell.

00:28.831 --> 00:30.932
I smell pretty flowers.

00:31.909 --> 00:34.140
I use my fingers to touch.

00:35.213 --> 00:37.368
I touch the fuzzy caterpillar.

00:38.485 --> 00:40.598
I use my tongue to taste.

00:41.707 --> 00:43.807
I taste sweet berries.

00:44.869 --> 00:46.916
I like to go to my garden.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.907
I use my five senses.

00:51.018 --> 00:53.300
I use them to see and hear.

00:54.363 --> 00:56.935
I use them to smell and taste.

00:58.025 --> 00:59.597
I use them to touch.

01:00.716 --> 01:03.332
I learn a lot from my senses.
