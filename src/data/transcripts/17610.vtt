Let's make a cheese cake for Dad.

00:05.103 --> 00:06.383
That's a good idea.

00:07.049 --> 00:09.189
Then what do we need to make cake?

00:10.404 --> 00:14.788
We need a bag of flour and five slices of cheese.

00:15.198 --> 00:16.585
What else do we need?

00:17.765 --> 00:21.272
We need a dozen eggs, a glass of milk and 

00:22.479 --> 00:24.513
Do we need so many eggs?

00:25.720 --> 00:29.157
Umm, I'm not sure. We'd better ask Mom.

00:35.062 --> 00:38.457
A pig in a wig and a dog in a bog.

00:38.995 --> 00:43.166
How many rhymes, how many rhymes each day?

00:46.269 --> 00:49.771
A flag in a bag and a nag with a tag.

00:50.198 --> 00:54.715
How many rhymes, how many rhymes did I say?

00:57.566 --> 01:00.999
A cat on a mat and a rat in a hat.

01:01.516 --> 01:05.710
How many rhymes, how many rhymes each day?

01:08.821 --> 01:12.273
A bat in a flat and Nat in a gat.

01:12.771 --> 01:16.978
How many rhymes, how many rhymes did I say?
