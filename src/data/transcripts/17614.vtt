Did you have lunch, Sarah?

00:05.181 --> 00:08.447
Yes, I had a hamburger and Coke for lunch.

00:08.931 --> 00:10.284
What about you, Andy?

00:11.369 --> 00:12.940
I had rice and soup.

00:13.266 --> 00:17.157
I don't like instant food such as hamburgers and French fries.

00:18.277 --> 00:21.537
I know eating instant food is not good for our health.

00:21.909 --> 00:24.717
But it is yummy and easy to get.

00:25.843 --> 00:28.329
I know you don't like eating vegetables.

00:28.977 --> 00:31.781
Eating lots of vegetables is good for our health.

00:32.895 --> 00:34.063
That's not true!

00:34.563 --> 00:38.405
I enjoy eating vegetables such as cucumbers and lettuce.

00:39.371 --> 00:42.385
You do? I thought you don't eat vegetables.

00:43.479 --> 00:46.569
I eat most vegetables except spinach.
