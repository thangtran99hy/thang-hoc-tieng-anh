Kevin, where are you?

00:05.109 --> 00:06.439
I'm in the kitchen.

00:06.779 --> 00:08.555
I'm eating some snack, Mom.

00:09.539 --> 00:11.163
Did you finish your math homework?

00:12.135 --> 00:13.453
No, not yet.

00:14.481 --> 00:16.821
You had better finish your homework before 5.

00:17.397 --> 00:19.986
It's Dad's birthday, and we're going out for dinner.

00:20.910 --> 00:24.595
I know, but I never have time to do my homework today.

00:25.627 --> 00:27.477
What did you do after school?

00:28.485 --> 00:32.530
I went to the library to borrow books that I need for my papers.

00:33.475 --> 00:37.055
Anyway, you'd better try to finish your homework before dinner.

00:38.047 --> 00:39.625
Okay, I will.
