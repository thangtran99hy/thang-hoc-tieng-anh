Hi, Sam.

00:04.604 --> 00:06.975
Hi, Paula. What are you doing here?

00:07.993 --> 00:09.891
I'm looking for Amy's house.

00:10.224 --> 00:12.313
I know she lives in this apartment.

00:12.624 --> 00:15.161
But I don't know which floor she lives on.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.433
I can help you find Amy's house.

00:18.774 --> 00:21.143
She lives on the same floor with me.

00:22.141 --> 00:23.317
Oh, thanks.

00:24.359 --> 00:26.766
Then how come you are visiting Amy?

00:27.709 --> 00:30.903
She promised that she would give me some game CDs.

00:31.355 --> 00:34.071
I can't wait for her to come to my place.

00:35.020 --> 00:36.767
Wow, how nice!

00:37.372 --> 00:39.706
Here we are. Push the bell.
