Hi, Brian. What did you do last weekend?

00:06.697 --> 00:08.993
I went to my cousin's birthday party.

00:10.018 --> 00:12.642
Wow! Did you have a good time there?

00:13.683 --> 00:16.402
Yes, I enjoyed myself at the party.

00:17.382 --> 00:19.548
What did you give her for her birthday?

00:20.536 --> 00:23.303
I made a special card and cookies myself.

00:24.255 --> 00:25.289
How nice!

00:26.323 --> 00:27.897
How was your weekend, Betty?

00:28.941 --> 00:31.706
I went to the amusement park with my family.

00:32.261 --> 00:35.189
And I saw a woman in a polka-dot dress there.

00:36.240 --> 00:38.543
A woman in a polka-dot dress?

00:39.621 --> 00:42.650
Yes. She was our English teacher!
