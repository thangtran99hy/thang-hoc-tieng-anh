Dad, what time did you come home last night?

00:06.533 --> 00:08.193
I came home at 11:00.

00:09.217 --> 00:10.422
Aren't you tired?

00:11.467 --> 00:15.037
Of course I am. I'm really tired with hard work.

00:16.120 --> 00:18.941
Then can't you take us to the zoo today?

00:20.035 --> 00:23.501
Umm. Why don't we watch cartoons instead?

00:24.551 --> 00:28.417
I'm sick and tired of watching cartoons at home, Dad.

00:29.009 --> 00:31.547
Jeff and I watched cartoons yesterday.

00:32.624 --> 00:34.775
How about playing video games then?

00:35.243 --> 00:37.210
Don't you like playing video games?

00:38.195 --> 00:40.560
Yes, I do like video games.

00:40.843 --> 00:42.132
Let's play games!
