00:02.533 --> 00:05.215
My dad wants nothing for Father's Day.

00:06.371 --> 00:07.907
"Nothing at all?"

00:08.545 --> 00:09.383
I asked.

00:10.451 --> 00:11.594
"Not a thing,"...

00:12.197 --> 00:13.036
...said Dad.

00:14.223 --> 00:17.106
Last year, I gave him a funny tie.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.209
It made everyone laugh.

00:21.255 --> 00:23.372
Dad says he has enough ties.

00:24.467 --> 00:27.420
Last year, my sister gave him a hat.

00:28.483 --> 00:30.903
It made him look like a big rabbit.

00:31.938 --> 00:34.195
Dad says he has enough hats.

00:35.305 --> 00:38.416
Last year, my brother gave him socks.

00:39.513 --> 00:40.912
Dad wore them once.

00:42.013 --> 00:44.253
I think Dad has enough socks.

00:45.353 --> 00:48.434
Last year, Mom gave him a computer game.

00:49.543 --> 00:51.841
It made his computer crash.

00:52.944 --> 00:53.935
Dad said,..

00:54.411 --> 00:56.453
"Enough computer games!"

00:57.529 --> 01:00.421
This year, Dad wants to watch TV.

01:01.451 --> 01:04.026
He wants to take it easy and play.

01:05.071 --> 01:08.403
He wants nothing, but we have a plan.

01:09.329 --> 01:11.213
We will watch TV.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.269
We will play.

01:14.347 --> 01:18.860
And we will give him the biggest hug just for Father's Day.
