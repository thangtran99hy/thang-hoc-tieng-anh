Last Saturday was my mom's birthday.

00:05.957 --> 00:08.157
Did you buy anything special for her?

00:09.261 --> 00:11.945
No, I didn't buy anything for her.

00:12.549 --> 00:15.822
I cleaned the house and cooked dinner instead.

00:16.923 --> 00:19.870
Then did your mom get nothing for her birthday?

00:21.007 --> 00:24.465
My brother gave her a bunch of flowers and a hair pin.

00:25.195 --> 00:29.070
My dad bought her a beautiful dress and a scarf!

00:30.199 --> 00:30.821
Wow.

00:31.286 --> 00:33.042
She might be very happy.

00:39.839 --> 00:43.029
My dad wants nothing for Father's Day.

00:43.836 --> 00:50.109
Last year I gave him a tie and now he has enough ties.

00:51.077 --> 00:57.593
My sister gave him a hat and now he has enough hats.

00:58.588 --> 01:05.089
My brother gave him socks and now he has enough socks.

01:06.309 --> 01:12.679
Mom gave him a computer game and now he has enough games.

01:13.801 --> 01:19.990
This year, Dad wants nothing but we have a plan.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.757
We will watch TV, watch TV.

01:25.029 --> 01:27.349
We will play, play, play.

01:28.789 --> 01:34.394
And we will give him the biggest hug just for Father's Day.
