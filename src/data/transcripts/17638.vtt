00:02.667 --> 00:07.971
The Owl and the Pussycat went to sea in a beautiful pea-green boat.

00:08.885 --> 00:13.221
They took some honey and plenty of money, wrapped in a five-dollar note.

00:14.143 --> 00:16.904
The Owl looked up at the stars above.

00:17.831 --> 00:19.950
He sang with a small guitar.

00:21.174 --> 00:24.574
Oh, lovely Kitty, oh Kitty, my love.

00:25.093 --> 00:28.896
What a beautiful Kitty you are. You are. You are.

00:29.281 --> 00:31.421
What a beautiful Kitty you are.

00:32.850 --> 00:34.341
Kitty said to the Owl.

00:35.343 --> 00:37.025
You're such a nice fowl.

00:37.375 --> 00:39.733
And how wonderfully sweet you sing.

00:40.670 --> 00:42.555
Then the lovely Kitty said.

00:43.679 --> 00:45.259
I think we should wed.

00:45.659 --> 00:47.875
But what shall we do for a ring.

00:48.931 --> 00:54.314
They then sailed away for a year and a day to the land where the Pong tree grows.

00:55.352 --> 00:58.365
And there in the wood a piggy wig stood.

00:59.167 --> 01:03.295
She had a ring at the end of her nose, her nose, her nose.

01:04.417 --> 01:06.853
She had a ring at the end of her nose.

01:07.702 --> 01:09.657
Then they asked the fat pig.

01:10.882 --> 01:13.345
Will you trade the ring for a wig?

01:14.601 --> 01:15.771
Said the fat piggy.
