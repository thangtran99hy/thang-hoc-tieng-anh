Once, many years ago, all the birds of the world met together.

00:08.177 --> 00:09.358
They had a problem.

00:10.589 --> 00:14.880
It all started when foxes began to chase robins.

00:15.821 --> 00:18.403
Foxes normally chased chickens.

00:19.597 --> 00:23.113
One day, a fox followed the tracks of a chicken.

00:23.879 --> 00:25.073
Or so it thought.

00:26.169 --> 00:28.847
The tracks really belonged to a robin.

00:29.901 --> 00:33.606
At that time, all the birds had the same tracks.

00:34.567 --> 00:37.021
Chickens knew to run from foxes.

00:38.217 --> 00:39.670
Robins did not.
