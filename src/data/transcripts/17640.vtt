00:02.704 --> 00:05.509
One day, Leopard went out hunting.

00:06.397 --> 00:08.311
He came upon Ram's house.

00:09.017 --> 00:13.609
Leopard was a great hunter, but he had never seen Ram in his life.

00:14.325 --> 00:16.517
Leopard was a little afraid of him.

00:17.259 --> 00:19.258
He went to Ram and said meekly.

00:20.405 --> 00:23.277
Good day, friend. Who might you be?

00:24.337 --> 00:25.895
I am Ram.

00:27.092 --> 00:29.197
said Ram in a gruff voice.

00:30.271 --> 00:31.529
Who are you?

00:32.509 --> 00:34.149
I am only Leopard.

00:35.305 --> 00:36.923
said Leopard softly.

00:37.782 --> 00:40.981
Leopard was so scared, he ran straight home.

00:41.777 --> 00:44.940
As soon as Leopard got home, he went to Jackal.

00:45.777 --> 00:47.793
Jackal's house was close by.

00:48.701 --> 00:50.481
I had such a fright!

00:51.507 --> 00:52.601
panted Leopard.

00:53.565 --> 00:55.801
I saw such a fierce fellow!

00:56.311 --> 01:00.624
He had a large head, terrible horns, and a rough voice!

01:01.207 --> 01:03.075
He said his name was Ram.

01:04.047 --> 01:06.039
How foolish you are!

01:07.044 --> 01:08.083
Jackal laughed.

01:09.307 --> 01:14.151
Ram cannot hurt a flea, and his meat is juicy and sweet.

01:14.441 --> 01:16.289
I thought you were a hunter.

01:16.691 --> 01:19.391
Tomorrow we shall go and eat him.

01:20.739 --> 01:22.681
Leopard was still afraid.

01:23.207 --> 01:26.770
He wanted to seem brave, so he said he would go.

01:27.417 --> 01:31.399
The next day, Jackal tied Leopard to his leg with a string.

01:32.057 --> 01:34.833
This way, Leopard could not run away.

01:35.489 --> 01:39.029
Ram saw the two friends as they came to the top of the hill.

01:39.699 --> 01:41.417
Ram ran into his house.

01:42.261 --> 01:44.473
Wife, what shall we do?

01:45.137 --> 01:45.894
he asked.

01:46.630 --> 01:49.497
Jackal and Leopard are both after us.

01:50.579 --> 01:52.023
Have no fear.

01:52.675 --> 01:53.632
said his wife.

01:54.443 --> 01:57.223
Take our child in your arms and go outside.

01:57.547 --> 02:00.606
Pinch her to make her cry as if she were hungry.

02:01.660 --> 02:04.344
Ram took the child and did as he was told.

02:05.201 --> 02:08.715
He stepped outside just as Leopard and Jackal arrived.

02:09.851 --> 02:13.139
As soon as Leopard saw Ram, he grew afraid.

02:13.613 --> 02:16.758
He pulled back, but Jackal jerked the string.

02:17.695 --> 02:19.002
Come on.

02:19.993 --> 02:20.787
he said.

02:21.645 --> 02:23.743
He cannot hurt you.

02:24.734 --> 02:27.959
Ram saw Leopard's fear, and he pinched the child.

02:28.596 --> 02:32.837
The child began to cry, and Ram said in a rough voice.

02:33.828 --> 02:36.084
Jackal, you have done well.

02:36.313 --> 02:38.519
You have brought us the leopard to eat.

02:38.963 --> 02:40.543
You are just in time.

02:40.889 --> 02:43.351
My child is crying for food.

02:44.491 --> 02:47.301
These words were more than Leopard could stand.

02:47.890 --> 02:51.927
He leaped away and began to run, dragging Jackal with him.

02:52.603 --> 02:56.909
Leopard ran up and down hills, through bushes, and under rocks.

02:57.285 --> 03:01.664
He did not look back until poor Jackal was bruised from head to toe.
