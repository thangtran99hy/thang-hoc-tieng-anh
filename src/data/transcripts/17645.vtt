I think you eat too much meat.

00:06.105 --> 00:09.888
I know. Now I'm trying to eat more vegetables.

00:11.260 --> 00:14.274
And you had better do exercise every day.

00:16.528 --> 00:19.062
I heard Jamie has already left home.

00:19.531 --> 00:22.341
You had better start at once. You are getting late.

00:23.455 --> 00:24.839
What time is it, Betty?

00:26.113 --> 00:27.383
It's ten to three.

00:29.465 --> 00:32.349
Kate said that she gained 3 kilograms.

00:33.519 --> 00:36.247
She had better not eat after 7.

00:37.478 --> 00:41.301
I agree with you. She always eats snacks late at night.
