How nice the MP3 player is!

00:06.268 --> 00:09.923
Will you trade your MP3 player for my cell phone?

00:11.176 --> 00:13.343
Okay. I need a cell phone.

00:15.514 --> 00:18.344
Wow! Did you buy a new bike?

00:19.593 --> 00:24.113
No. Actually I traded my skateboard for my brother's bike.

00:25.345 --> 00:27.603
What a nice bike it is!

00:28.629 --> 00:29.545
Thanks.

00:31.705 --> 00:36.069
I'm thinking of trading my music CDs for Amy's game CDs.

00:36.357 --> 00:39.863
I don't need them anymore because I lost my CD player.

00:40.939 --> 00:42.639
What a good idea!
