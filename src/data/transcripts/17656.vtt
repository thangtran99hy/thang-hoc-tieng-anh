00:02.396 --> 00:06.248
Mr. Smith was a mailman, and he wore a mailman's hat.

00:07.253 --> 00:11.723
He carried a pouch full of letters for the people on Dew Melon Way.

00:12.806 --> 00:16.501
He also had a whistle that he would blow at every stop.

00:17.507 --> 00:23.701
When the whistle blew, people would come out of their homes to see if there was mail in their boxes.

00:24.733 --> 00:27.912
But there was one house where the whistle didn't blow.

00:28.917 --> 00:31.171
A dog named Duffy lived there.

00:32.176 --> 00:34.632
Duffy loved to bark and bite.

00:35.637 --> 00:41.244
Each day, Mr. Smith would tiptoe up the walk to the house where Duffy napped.

00:42.327 --> 00:46.611
Trying not to make a sound, he would put the mail in the box.

00:47.669 --> 00:49.763
Duffy was a very light sleeper.

00:50.691 --> 00:53.559
He would wake with a bark and a snap.

00:54.685 --> 00:58.820
Then he would chase Mr. Smith off the porch and down the block.

00:59.929 --> 01:01.868
Every day, rain or shine,...

01:02.770 --> 01:06.181
...Mr. Smith would bring the mail to Dew Melon Way.

01:07.265 --> 01:10.393
And every day, he would get chased by Duffy.

01:11.529 --> 01:14.835
That is, until one gusty day in March,...

01:15.801 --> 01:18.566
...the wind was blowing very hard that morning.

01:19.572 --> 01:24.817
Mr. Smith's hat flew off his head and into the air like a kite.

01:25.822 --> 01:29.303
His hat landed right on top of Duffy's dish!

01:30.257 --> 01:34.547
Duffy jumped up from a sound sleep, barking at the noise.

01:35.553 --> 01:43.326
Mr. Smith was sure that Duffy would chew his hat to shreds and that he would be a mailman without a hat.

01:44.203 --> 01:46.341
But he had an idea.

01:47.457 --> 01:51.361
When Mr. Smith came to the porch, Duffy was waiting.

01:52.399 --> 01:55.061
He had the mailman's hat in his mouth.

01:56.144 --> 01:59.328
Mr. Smith reached into his pouch for the mail.

02:00.347 --> 02:03.241
But what he pulled out was a dog biscuit.

02:04.318 --> 02:08.467
Duffy didn't shred the mailman's hat or bark at Mr. Smith.

02:09.525 --> 02:16.323
Instead, he dropped the hat at Mr. Smith's feet, sat quietly, and waited for his treat.

02:17.485 --> 02:23.265
From that day forward, Mr. Smith brought more than just the mail to Dew Melon Way.

02:24.284 --> 02:31.081
He brought a biscuit for his friend, Duffy, who wagged his tail whenever the mail whistle blew.
