00:02.497 --> 00:05.252
Long ago, it grew very cold.

00:06.328 --> 00:08.972
Ice and snow covered the land.

00:10.052 --> 00:11.891
Corn could not grow.

00:12.955 --> 00:17.385
Glooskap, the leader of the people, had to do something.

00:18.495 --> 00:21.099
Glooskap went far to the north.

00:22.162 --> 00:24.693
Everything was white with snow.

00:25.728 --> 00:28.577
He came to a house made of ice.

00:29.631 --> 00:32.719
A giant named Winter lived there.

00:33.783 --> 00:36.817
Winter invited Glooskap inside.

00:37.876 --> 00:40.414
Winter began to tell stories.

00:41.532 --> 00:45.051
Glooskap fell asleep under Winter's spell.

00:46.061 --> 00:48.445
But Glooskap's bird woke him up.

00:49.538 --> 00:51.433
"Go south, Glooskap"...

00:52.507 --> 00:53.205
...said bird.

00:54.284 --> 00:57.477
You will find a woman who can help you.

00:58.561 --> 01:00.431
Glooskap went to the south.

01:01.400 --> 01:05.419
He came to a land where it was warm and sunny.

01:06.453 --> 01:09.430
Grass grew and flowers bloomed.

01:10.482 --> 01:14.186
Glooskap saw Summer dancing in the field.

01:15.189 --> 01:18.297
She had a crown of flowers in her hair.

01:19.400 --> 01:22.418
Glooskap asked Summer to come north.

01:23.459 --> 01:26.793
She came with him to Winter's house of ice.

01:27.875 --> 01:29.684
Winter invited them in.

01:30.709 --> 01:33.192
He began to tell stories again.

01:34.279 --> 01:37.434
But Winter's spells did not work on Summer.

01:38.475 --> 01:40.913
She began to sing her own spell.

01:41.975 --> 01:45.090
Winter's house of ice began to melt.

01:46.183 --> 01:48.789
"I am stronger than you."

01:49.891 --> 01:50.647
...said Summer.

01:51.709 --> 01:53.630
"You must leave this land"...

01:54.655 --> 01:55.351
...she said.

01:56.268 --> 01:57.847
Old Winter cried.

01:58.869 --> 02:02.540
His tears became rivers of melted snow.

02:03.643 --> 02:04.754
The corn grew.

02:05.811 --> 02:07.773
The flowers bloomed again.

02:08.799 --> 02:10.529
Summer spoke to Winter.

02:11.625 --> 02:13.223
You will live in the north.

02:13.796 --> 02:15.755
You may visit the other lands.

02:16.207 --> 02:19.687
But in the spring, I will make you leave.

02:20.731 --> 02:25.277
Since that day Winter rules for part of the year.

02:26.346 --> 02:29.883
But every spring Summer drives him away.

02:30.909 --> 02:34.620
Sometimes it seems like winter will never end.

02:35.668 --> 02:38.003
But spring will always come.
