A line connects two points.

00:05.728 --> 00:07.889
A line is longer than it is wide.

00:08.977 --> 00:11.667
Lines can be short, and lines can be long.

00:12.723 --> 00:15.536
Lines can be straight, and lines can be curved.

00:16.582 --> 00:18.442
You can bend lines to make a shape.

00:19.459 --> 00:22.167
You can join straight lines together to make a shape.

00:23.203 --> 00:25.695
You can join curved lines together to make a shape.

00:26.723 --> 00:28.511
There are many kinds of shapes.

00:29.549 --> 00:34.236
Circles, squares, rectangles, and triangles are geometric shapes.

00:35.291 --> 00:38.307
We can use geometric shapes to draw many things.

00:39.347 --> 00:42.745
When a line goes all the way around, it makes a circle.

00:43.797 --> 00:48.753
You can use a circle, three small circles and a curved line to make a face.

00:49.871 --> 00:52.607
On another piece of paper, draw a circle.

00:53.659 --> 00:57.005
Then make it a mouse with eyes, ears, and whiskers.

00:58.084 --> 01:00.019
Use lines and more circles.

01:01.109 --> 01:04.865
If we cut a circle in half, we get two half circles.

01:05.927 --> 01:09.102
You can use four half circles to draw a caterpillar.

01:10.113 --> 01:13.339
On another piece of paper, draw a half circle.

01:14.339 --> 01:18.577
Then make it into a fish with eyes, a tail, and fins.

01:19.711 --> 01:24.054
When a line turns a corner three times, it makes a triangle.

01:25.095 --> 01:27.770
Triangles have three sides and three corners.
