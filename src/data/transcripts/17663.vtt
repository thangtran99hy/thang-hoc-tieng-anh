00:02.737 --> 00:07.981
Anna looked out her grandmother's window as dark clouds piled up in the sky.

00:08.961 --> 00:12.469
"I hope it doesn't rain, Oma.",  Anna said.

00:13.515 --> 00:17.196
"Remember what Opa told you.",  Oma said.

00:18.273 --> 00:21.309
"A little rain makes all things better,...

00:22.349 --> 00:25.681
...not school picnics.", said Anna.

00:26.674 --> 00:32.770
"True.", Oma nodded, "Rain and picnics are not so good.".

00:33.805 --> 00:37.327
Anna looked at the box of cupcakes with pink icing.

00:38.310 --> 00:40.667
Oma and Anna had worked hard on them.

00:41.689 --> 00:45.913
"Rain is not good for cupcakes, either.", said Anna.

00:46.942 --> 00:48.516
Oma tapped her chin.

00:49.500 --> 00:53.014
"I wonder if you could.", she murmured.

00:53.983 --> 00:55.914
"What?", asked Anna.

00:56.946 --> 01:02.024
"No.", Oma said, "You are too young.".

01:03.027 --> 01:03.981
"Tell me!"

01:04.920 --> 01:12.106
"I was thinking," said Oma, "about Opa's magic coat."

01:13.096 --> 01:15.975
"Magic coat?" asked Anna.

01:16.888 --> 01:23.793
"It's the long coat, gray as a cloud, that hangs by the door," Oma said.

01:24.795 --> 01:28.295
Quick as lightning, Anna ran to get the coat.

01:29.317 --> 01:33.939
"A sailor gave it to Opa long ago," said Oma.

01:34.879 --> 01:38.506
"Whoever wears it can choose the weather."

01:39.476 --> 01:41.249
Anna put on the coat.

01:42.223 --> 01:46.734
"Oof, magic coats are heavy," she said.

01:47.683 --> 01:54.336
She took her cupcakes, ran outside, and shouted at the rain clouds, "Be gone!"

01:55.284 --> 01:58.587
At once, a wind played at Anna's feet.

01:59.578 --> 02:04.309
It lifted the bottom of Opa's coat and spun up into the sky.

02:05.277 --> 02:09.406
The wind sliced through the clouds, and the sky turned blue.

02:10.384 --> 02:13.330
"It works!" sang Anna.

02:14.309 --> 02:19.495
"Wait!" called Oma, but Anna was too far away to hear.

02:20.511 --> 02:23.211
Anna set her cupcakes on the picnic table.

02:24.211 --> 02:27.309
"Tag! You're it!" said Jayda.

02:28.329 --> 02:33.021
Anna tried to run after Jayda, but Opa's coat wrapped around her feet.

02:34.037 --> 02:37.991
"You could run better without your coat," Ms. Storm said.

02:38.975 --> 02:40.707
Anna peeked at the blue sky.

02:41.717 --> 02:46.137
She undid the top button of Opa's coat, and a breeze tickled her cheek.

02:47.151 --> 02:50.989
She undid the second button, and the breeze blew stronger.

02:51.943 --> 02:55.767
She undid the third, and a black cloud went over the sun.

02:56.773 --> 03:01.068
"Oh well, I don't like tag anyway," said Anna.

03:02.023 --> 03:05.026
She buttoned up the coat, and the sun came back.

03:05.924 --> 03:09.232
"Hide-and-seek!" shouted the children.

03:10.279 --> 03:12.017
"Ms. Storm is it!"

03:13.021 --> 03:14.739
Anna hid behind a tree.

03:15.640 --> 03:20.300
But Opa's magic coat stuck out, and Ms. Storm found her right away.

03:21.289 --> 03:23.114
At last, it was time to eat.

03:24.056 --> 03:27.660
But Anna was so hot in the magic coat that her tummy hurt.

03:28.677 --> 03:30.239
She couldn't eat one bite.

03:31.249 --> 03:34.571
"Darn this magic coat!" Anna said.

03:35.528 --> 03:38.883
"What fun is a picnic with no games or food?"

03:39.879 --> 03:43.407
Anna undid the buttons of Opa's coat and took it off.

03:44.345 --> 03:48.145
The wind swirled around her feet and up into the sky.

03:49.126 --> 03:53.063
Black clouds piled up, and fat raindrops fell.

03:54.039 --> 03:57.803
"Everyone run into the gym!", shouted Ms. Storm.

03:58.811 --> 04:01.601
The children grabbed their plates and ran inside.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.275
Anna hung Opa's magic coat on a hook.

04:06.250 --> 04:09.641
"Who wants to play Red Rover?", Jayda asked.

04:10.631 --> 04:15.680
"I do!", said Anna, and she ran, quick as lightning, to play.
