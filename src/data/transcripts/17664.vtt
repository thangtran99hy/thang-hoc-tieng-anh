Let's draw various things using geometric shapes.

00:07.379 --> 00:08.497
That sounds fun.

00:09.559 --> 00:13.207
First, we need a sketchbook and crayons to draw them.

00:14.261 --> 00:17.388
OK. I'll go get a sketchbook and crayons.

00:18.402 --> 00:20.905
Can you draw a bus using rectangles?

00:21.923 --> 00:22.973
Yes, I can.

00:23.357 --> 00:27.101
I can draw a bus using rectangles and circles.

00:28.078 --> 00:31.045
What can you make using four triangles?

00:32.079 --> 00:35.972
I can make a face on a pumpkin using four triangles.

00:36.975 --> 00:40.309
That's right. Then, what do you use to make a truck?

00:41.358 --> 00:44.985
I use squares and half circles to make a truck.

00:46.027 --> 00:47.106
Good job.
