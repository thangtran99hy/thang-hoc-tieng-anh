My brother told me what he wants.

00:05.664 --> 00:07.365
He wants to go to school.

00:08.357 --> 00:10.975
What your brother wants is to go to school?

00:11.743 --> 00:12.733
How old is he?

00:13.684 --> 00:15.235
He is five years old.

00:16.223 --> 00:18.555
He is too young to go to school.

00:19.509 --> 00:22.153
I know, but he doesn't understand it.

00:23.223 --> 00:24.625
What else does he want?

00:25.714 --> 00:27.151
This is what he wants.

00:28.169 --> 00:28.971
What's that?

00:29.983 --> 00:31.431
It is my cell phone.

00:32.503 --> 00:36.515
Oh, no. He is too young to use a cell phone.

00:37.535 --> 00:42.797
That's what I think. If I let him use it, he'll probably break it.
