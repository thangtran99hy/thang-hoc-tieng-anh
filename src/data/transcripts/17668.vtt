Jackie, it's time to go to bed!

00:05.667 --> 00:09.871
Mom, I want to play computer games. Tomorrow is Sunday!

00:10.316 --> 00:12.897
Sunday is the day when I don't go to school.

00:15.952 --> 00:17.565
What are you doing, Alex?

00:18.615 --> 00:20.412
I'm doing my English homework.

00:21.392 --> 00:23.252
Try to finish it before dinner.

00:24.333 --> 00:25.776
OK. I'll try, Mom.

00:28.850 --> 00:31.049
Mom, can I watch cartoons?

00:32.141 --> 00:34.679
No way. Dad is sleeping now.

00:35.218 --> 00:37.023
You need to try not to wake him up.
