00:02.448 --> 00:04.021
People call me Eggy.

00:05.117 --> 00:06.905
But that's not my real name.

00:07.918 --> 00:12.435
When my brother Jordan first saw me when I was a baby, he said,

00:13.519 --> 00:15.437
"His head looks like an egg!"

00:16.587 --> 00:19.711
My head is normal now, but the nickname stuck.

00:20.810 --> 00:25.141
Jordan has always liked to throw things, especially at me.

00:26.213 --> 00:29.102
Mom says I could catch even before I could walk.

00:30.143 --> 00:34.172
Now that he's twelve, Jordan has a super strong arm.
