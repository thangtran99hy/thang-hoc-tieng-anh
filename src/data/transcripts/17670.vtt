Come here, Emma.

00:03.798 --> 00:06.008
I'll show you some pictures of my friends.

00:07.089 --> 00:08.539
Who is this guy, Kevin?

00:09.653 --> 00:11.553
I think you know him, don't you?

00:12.561 --> 00:14.441
No, I don't. Who's he?

00:15.505 --> 00:16.592
He is Sam.

00:16.948 --> 00:18.767
Don't you remember meeting him before?

00:19.851 --> 00:22.411
No, I don't. When did I see him?

00:23.429 --> 00:26.031
Do you remember going to the bookstore last month?

00:27.094 --> 00:30.587
Of course. I remember going to the bookstore with you.

00:31.667 --> 00:33.203
That's when we met Sam.

00:34.299 --> 00:36.538
Oh, I do remember now.
