00:04.422 --> 00:09.423
This is the new Microsoft Surface.

00:11.257 --> 00:18.270
It embodies the notion of hardware and software really pushing each other.

00:19.306 --> 00:23.341
People do want to create and consume.

00:24.153 --> 00:28.015
They want to work and they want to play.

00:28.681 --> 00:32.513
They want to be on their couch, they want to be at their desk...

00:33.099 --> 00:34.843
...and they want to be on the go.

00:35.738 --> 00:43.674
Surface is super thin at 9.3 millimeters. It's just thin enough for this full-size USB port,...

00:44.358 --> 00:47.476
...for peripherals or just charging your phone while you're at the hotel.

00:48.353 --> 00:54.914
The edges are beveled away at 22 degrees so the PC itself fades into the background.

00:55.613 --> 00:57.583
It feels natural in your hands.

00:58.691 --> 01:03.522
Surface is the first PC with a full magnesium case.

01:04.143 --> 01:11.406
Through a unique process, the liquid metal is formed into an ultra rigid yet ultralight frame.

01:12.112 --> 01:19.350
It is incredibly strong. And it's airy at under 1.5 pounds, just 676 grams.

01:19.877 --> 01:21.203
And it's finely balanced.

01:21.716 --> 01:26.598
We think that a stand should be integral so we built a stand into the device.

01:27.949 --> 01:32.456
Let me attach the cover. Click. You heard that, it's solid.

01:34.259 --> 01:34.611
Click.

01:35.634 --> 01:38.072
Close the cover, it's integrated into the device.

01:38.710 --> 01:41.690
It's made from a fine Northwest polar tech.

01:43.975 --> 01:47.076
It feels great in your hand, like a book. It just fits there.

01:47.691 --> 01:51.666
Why shouldn't we just take this surface and make it a full multi-touch keyboard?

02:01.670 --> 02:05.443
This touch cover is not just a multi-touch keyboard,...

02:05.817 --> 02:08.699
...but it's a modern trackpad with left and right buttons.

02:08.962 --> 02:12.029
It even has the keys for the Windows 8 Metro style UI.

02:12.817 --> 02:18.669
This keyboard, combined with the kickstand, form the hallmark of just hands-on creativity.
