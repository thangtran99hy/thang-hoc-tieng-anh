00:02.404 --> 00:06.059
The mice and the men ate the same food.

00:07.142 --> 00:09.607
They lived in the same houses.

00:10.649 --> 00:14.190
But they did not like each other at all.

00:15.251 --> 00:18.979
The mice said the men ate too much food.

00:20.024 --> 00:24.371
The men said the mice gnawed the walls of the houses.

00:25.448 --> 00:29.264
The mice and men decided to go to war.

00:30.314 --> 00:32.598
The men were sure they would win.

00:33.615 --> 00:36.316
They were so much bigger than the mice.

00:37.383 --> 00:41.217
The men did many things to get ready for the war.

00:42.227 --> 00:44.763
They put new strings on their bows.

00:45.753 --> 00:48.237
They put feathers on their arrows.

00:49.289 --> 00:52.497
They made slings to throw rocks at the mice.

00:53.585 --> 00:57.631
Before the war, the men had a big war dance.

00:58.707 --> 01:01.520
The dancing made them very tired.

01:02.569 --> 01:03.841
They all fell asleep.

01:04.893 --> 01:07.995
Then the little mice crept into the room.

01:09.044 --> 01:11.447
They gnawed the strings of the bows.

01:12.515 --> 01:15.123
They cut the feathers from the arrows.

01:16.190 --> 01:18.817
They broke the slings with their sharp teeth.

01:19.896 --> 01:22.479
Then they gave a great war yell.

01:23.548 --> 01:25.722
Squeak!

01:26.826 --> 01:29.883
The men woke up, and they saw the mice.

01:30.951 --> 01:34.578
They reached for their bows, but the strings were gnawed.

01:35.611 --> 01:37.520
They picked up their arrows.

01:38.587 --> 01:40.265
The feathers were all cut.

01:41.280 --> 01:42.895
They took up their slings.

01:43.933 --> 01:45.958
Every sling was broken.

01:46.986 --> 01:49.448
The men had nothing to fight with.

01:50.503 --> 01:52.771
They could not drive the mice away.

01:53.826 --> 01:58.041
The mice won the war, even though they were smaller.

01:59.097 --> 02:02.752
Mice have been in men's houses ever since.
