00:02.590 --> 00:04.745
It is Mexican Independence Day!

00:05.834 --> 00:09.351
Maria and Luis are getting ready for a big party.

00:10.445 --> 00:13.633
"We can decorate the house," says Maria.

00:14.737 --> 00:17.138
"Let's paint a picture of our family."

00:18.117 --> 00:22.691
"Mama was born first. She is the oldest," says Maria.

00:23.707 --> 00:26.683
"Papa was born second," Maria says.

00:27.772 --> 00:29.413
"He is one year younger."

00:30.511 --> 00:33.393
"Next is Emily," says Maria.

00:34.410 --> 00:37.185
"She is Mama and Papa's first child."

00:38.240 --> 00:41.566
"After Emily, you were born," says Luis.

00:42.657 --> 00:44.875
"That's right!" says Maria.

00:45.950 --> 00:48.657
"I am Mama and Papa's second child."

00:49.736 --> 00:52.315
"What about me?" asks Luis.

00:53.420 --> 00:56.880
"You were the last to be born," says Maria.

00:57.941 --> 00:59.529
"You are the youngest."

01:00.631 --> 01:02.475
"There!" says Maria.

01:03.622 --> 01:05.710
"Our family picture is done!"

01:06.732 --> 01:12.310
"Green, white, and red are the colors of the Mexican flag," says Maria.

01:13.387 --> 01:16.756
Maria and Luis blow up five green balloons.

01:17.843 --> 01:22.089
They blow up five white balloons and five red balloons, too.

01:23.113 --> 01:26.057
"I'm out of breath!" says Luis.

01:27.047 --> 01:29.407
"Let's see," says Maria.

01:30.497 --> 01:32.347
"We painted a picture first.

01:32.899 --> 01:34.751
We blew up balloons second.

01:35.881 --> 01:39.482
The third thing we can do is fill the pinata.

01:40.603 --> 01:43.865
Maria gets the striped fish pinata from the shelf.

01:44.971 --> 01:48.299
Maria and Luis stuff the pinata with candy.

01:49.361 --> 01:54.805
When Luis thinks Maria isn't looking, he pops a piece of candy into his mouth.

01:55.908 --> 01:57.445
Maria gives him a hug.

01:58.507 --> 02:00.969
"You are silly," she says.

02:02.015 --> 02:03.588
Papa hangs the pinata.

02:04.657 --> 02:07.515
"We need a blindfold," says Maria.

02:08.548 --> 02:11.421
"We need a stick to break the pinata, too."

02:12.486 --> 02:17.631
Abuela finds a red-checked scarf for Maria and a long stick for Luis.

02:18.710 --> 02:21.517
"The pinata is ready!" says Maria.

02:22.610 --> 02:26.105
"The fourth thing to do is practice dancing, Luis!"

02:27.157 --> 02:29.978
Maria and Luis dress in their party clothes.

02:31.057 --> 02:33.203
Then, they dance and spin.

02:34.288 --> 02:38.186
Soon, the house fills up with food, family, and music.

02:39.259 --> 02:44.403
There are six cousins, two aunts, three uncles, and three grandparents.

02:45.496 --> 02:49.565
There is Papa, Mama, Emily, Maria, and Luis, too.

02:50.669 --> 02:54.553
"There is one last thing we can do," Maria says.

02:55.644 --> 02:57.846
"And it's the most fun!"

02:58.800 --> 03:01.382
"What is it?" asks Luis.

03:02.483 --> 03:05.202
"CELEBRATE!" says Maria.
