Hi, Jamie.

00:03.419 --> 00:05.704
Hi, Sandy. Where are you going?

00:06.642 --> 00:07.868
I'm going shopping.

00:08.931 --> 00:10.862
Is your sister going shopping, too?

00:11.801 --> 00:15.487
No, she isn't. She is going fishing with my dad.

00:16.091 --> 00:18.383
Anyway, where are you going, Jamie?

00:19.489 --> 00:21.323
I'm going hiking with my brother.

00:22.411 --> 00:24.743
Wow! Have a good time, Jamie.

00:30.572 --> 00:33.780
I'm going camping with my mom and dad.

00:34.276 --> 00:37.912
We pack our tent, sleeping bags, and cooking gear.

00:38.144 --> 00:41.294
We drive to the lake, and we set up camp.

00:41.809 --> 00:45.231
We build a fire to cook hamburgers and hotdogs.

00:45.377 --> 00:48.933
We get into our sleeping bags and look at the stars.

00:49.317 --> 00:52.549
We see a bear eating berries in the morning.

00:53.068 --> 00:56.305
Mom catches three fish, and I catch a turtle.

00:56.606 --> 01:00.058
Our camping trip is over, and it's time to go home!
