00:02.535 --> 00:05.431
A dog and a cat got into a spat.

00:06.488 --> 00:09.329
Now, what do you think the cat thought of that?

00:10.415 --> 00:13.749
The dog chased the cat through a field of flowers.

00:14.782 --> 00:18.257
They ran, and they ran for hours and hours.

00:19.365 --> 00:22.847
The dog chased the cat through deep, deep mud.

00:23.915 --> 00:27.397
His hair and her fur were covered with crud.

00:28.472 --> 00:31.433
The cat leapt over a wall with a dash.

00:32.444 --> 00:36.202
But over the wall came the dog in a flash.

00:37.206 --> 00:40.793
And into the water went the cat with a splash.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.597
The cat swam quickly from shore to shore.

00:45.660 --> 00:48.859
The dog swam behind to chase her some more.

00:49.945 --> 00:52.679
The cat crawled out and shook off the water.

00:53.749 --> 00:56.956
The dog kept swimming as fast as an otter.

00:58.097 --> 01:01.027
The cat ran through the tall grass of a meadow.

01:02.030 --> 01:05.392
The dog that chased her was one angry fellow.

01:06.409 --> 01:09.718
She hid under a car with her tail sticking out.

01:10.794 --> 01:13.960
But the dog found her there, after looking about.

01:15.044 --> 01:18.205
From under the car the cat ran like a shot.

01:19.289 --> 01:22.668
She ran into a ditch, hoping not to get caught.

01:23.747 --> 01:25.554
But the dog followed after.

01:26.588 --> 01:28.227
The ditch stopped him not.

01:29.402 --> 01:32.331
The chase then finally came to a stop.

01:33.385 --> 01:36.540
The cat climbed a tree straight up to the top.

01:37.591 --> 01:40.592
The dog just sat beneath her and growled.

01:41.615 --> 01:42.951
The cat had escaped.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.947
The dog sat there and howled.
