What are you doing, Andy?

00:04.239 --> 00:06.257
I'm taking pictures of my puppy.

00:07.060 --> 00:08.489
What about you, Jenny?

00:09.748 --> 00:12.311
I am studying math for 2 hours.

00:13.349 --> 00:14.842
What is your sister doing?

00:16.031 --> 00:17.687
She is swimming in the pool.

00:18.445 --> 00:22.131
She learned how to swim during last summer vacation.

00:22.780 --> 00:25.525
And she continues to practice to swim.

00:32.236 --> 00:37.802
A dog and a cat, a dog and a cat got into a spat.

00:39.763 --> 00:43.360
The dog chased the cat through a field of flowers.

00:43.535 --> 00:46.877
The dog chased the cat through deep, deep mud.

00:47.268 --> 00:50.857
The cat leapt, leapt over a wall with a dash.

00:51.041 --> 00:54.433
The cat swam quickly from shore to shore.

00:54.770 --> 00:58.238
The cat ran through the tall grass of a meadow.

00:58.535 --> 01:01.986
The cat ran into a ditch, hoping not to get caught.

01:02.269 --> 01:05.727
The ditch stopped him not and the cat had escaped.
