00:04.423 --> 00:06.592
From the beginning, she was different.

00:07.681 --> 00:12.052
The moment she hatched from her tiny pink egg, she tried to leap.

00:13.129 --> 00:17.787
But she couldn't! The yolk from her egg hung from her belly.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.115
It slowed her down.

00:21.292 --> 00:27.316
For a while, the yolk was her food. As she ate, it got smaller and smaller.

00:28.218 --> 00:29.467
Then it was gone.

00:30.618 --> 00:36.469
Now she was a fry. She was slim, silver and one inch long.

00:37.550 --> 00:40.076
Oh, now how she could leap!

00:41.166 --> 00:45.591
All salmon are great leapers, but her leaping was special.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.364
"I love to leap!"...

00:49.037 --> 00:51.900
...she said, flinging herself into the air.

00:52.964 --> 00:55.975
"You'll never grow big, leaping like that,"...

00:56.627 --> 00:57.849
...said another salmon.

00:59.977 --> 01:06.395
But she did grow, just like the others. Soon, they knew it was time to leave home.

01:07.523 --> 01:14.405
They swam downstream and headed for the ocean. On the trip, she practiced her leaps.

01:15.551 --> 01:17.503
"I was born to leap!"...

01:17.924 --> 01:20.573
...she said, jumping higher and higher.

01:21.609 --> 01:24.453
"You'll hurt yourself, leaping like that,"...

01:24.975 --> 01:26.173
...said the other salmon.

01:27.251 --> 01:28.652
But she never did.

01:29.813 --> 01:33.073
In the ocean, she practiced her special leaps.

01:34.241 --> 01:35.885
She did a sideways roll!

01:37.078 --> 01:38.751
She did a double twist!

01:39.835 --> 01:41.937
She did a triple backward flip!

01:43.071 --> 01:44.407
"I must say,"...

01:45.032 --> 01:46.135
...said another salmon,...

01:46.637 --> 01:48.641
..."she is a lovely leaper."

01:51.414 --> 01:59.391
Years later, the salmon knew it was time to go home. It was time to go upstream to spawn.

02:00.551 --> 02:04.351
Soon, they would lay the eggs that would become baby salmon.

02:05.452 --> 02:07.925
They swam against the current of the stream.

02:09.020 --> 02:15.653
They struggled through rapids, leaped over waterfalls, and darted away from hungry predators.

02:16.813 --> 02:20.115
Then, at one waterfall they met a bear!

02:21.247 --> 02:22.898
"We'll never make it,"..

02:23.560 --> 02:24.655
...said one salmon.

02:25.815 --> 02:27.132
"We're done for,"...

02:27.787 --> 02:28.525
..said another.

02:29.721 --> 02:30.861
"Maybe not,"...

02:31.393 --> 02:32.892
...said the lovely leaper.

02:34.079 --> 02:40.635
She gathered all her strength and swam forward. She leaped with all her might.

02:41.750 --> 02:48.899
The bear had never seen anything like it! He watched her go up and up, higher and higher.

02:49.982 --> 02:57.215
He watched her twist one way, then another. He watched her flip end over end, and then backward!

02:58.341 --> 03:05.319
What the bear didn't see was the other salmon as they jumped the waterfall and swam safely away.

03:06.500 --> 03:13.885
Quickly, she followed! With one last mighty flip, she was over the falls and gone.

03:16.816 --> 03:19.922
Home at last, she dug a hole with her tail.

03:20.999 --> 03:25.081
As her final task, she laid hundreds of tiny pink eggs.

03:26.222 --> 03:29.325
Before long, the baby salmon would hatch.

03:30.449 --> 03:34.135
Like all salmon, they would be great leapers.

03:35.308 --> 03:39.353
And maybe one would be a really lovely leaper!
