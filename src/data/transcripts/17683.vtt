00:00.257 --> 00:01.859
Do you know where Brian is?

00:03.011 --> 00:05.683
I saw him waiting for a bus at the bus stop.

00:06.189 --> 00:06.831
Why?

00:07.847 --> 00:10.480
I need to ask him about our math homework.

00:11.033 --> 00:14.167
I called him several times, but he didn't answer.

00:15.271 --> 00:17.488
He said that he was going to the hospital.

00:18.233 --> 00:20.111
Coming back home, he will call you.

00:21.156 --> 00:21.993
Will he?

00:22.463 --> 00:25.019
But I can't wait until he comes back.

00:26.128 --> 00:27.969
Why don't you call Dana then?

00:28.961 --> 00:32.056
I watched her walk into her house 5 minutes ago.

00:33.055 --> 00:34.653
She must be at home.

00:35.601 --> 00:36.700
Thanks, Bobby.
