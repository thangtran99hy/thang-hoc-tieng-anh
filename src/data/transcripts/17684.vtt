00:02.451 --> 00:04.579
Roads, roads go everywhere.

00:05.624 --> 00:08.575
Roads go here, and roads go there.

00:09.597 --> 00:10.767
Look at the road.

00:11.803 --> 00:12.896
What do you see?

00:13.941 --> 00:16.421
I see a road going around corners.

00:17.471 --> 00:20.351
Twisting and turning, the road goes on.

00:21.445 --> 00:23.491
It winds around and around.

00:24.541 --> 00:26.263
Roads go through the country.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.988
They go to big cities.

00:30.110 --> 00:31.289
Look at the road.

00:32.313 --> 00:33.657
What do you see?

00:34.490 --> 00:37.029
I see a road going up the hill.

00:37.963 --> 00:40.346
I see a road going down the hill.

00:41.276 --> 00:45.523
Like a roller coaster, the road goes up and down.

00:46.465 --> 00:48.369
Roads go over mountains.

00:49.322 --> 00:51.045
They go through forests.

00:52.077 --> 00:53.349
Look at the road.

00:54.257 --> 00:55.471
What do you see?

00:56.481 --> 00:58.961
I see a road going into the tunnel.

00:59.971 --> 01:02.461
I see a road coming out of the tunnel.

01:03.471 --> 01:06.741
In and out of the tunnel, the road keeps going.

01:07.796 --> 01:09.665
Roads cross over rivers.

01:10.664 --> 01:11.969
They are on bridges.

01:12.979 --> 01:14.216
Look at the road.

01:15.203 --> 01:16.305
What do you see?

01:17.270 --> 01:19.411
I see a road that goes nowhere.

01:20.307 --> 01:22.392
I see a road that just stops.

01:23.435 --> 01:25.598
Wow, it is a dead end.
