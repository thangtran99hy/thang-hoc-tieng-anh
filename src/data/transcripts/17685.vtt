Let's read this storybook. Can you find a bear?

00:06.018 --> 00:10.421
Yes, Dad. Look at this! A bear goes into the tunnel.

00:11.391 --> 00:13.303
Then, can you find boys?

00:14.331 --> 00:16.938
I see a boy coming out of the tunnel.

00:17.538 --> 00:20.703
And there is another boy that goes through the forest.

00:21.723 --> 00:24.367
Where are rabbits? Can you find them?

00:25.387 --> 00:29.153
Yes, I see a rabbit that goes over the hill.

00:30.231 --> 00:34.583
Good. And I see another one that goes around the corner!

00:40.986 --> 00:44.149
Roads, roads, roads, roads go everywhere.

00:44.721 --> 00:50.979
I see a road going around corners, and it winds around.

00:52.219 --> 00:59.090
Roads go through the country, and they go to big cities.

00:59.739 --> 01:05.531
I see a road going up and down the hill like a roller coaster.

01:07.210 --> 01:13.745
Roads go over mountains, and they go through forests.

01:14.742 --> 01:21.005
I see a road going into and coming out of the tunnel.

01:22.177 --> 01:28.633
Roads cross over rivers, and they are on bridges.

01:29.737 --> 01:36.358
I see a road that just stops. Wow, it is a dead end.
