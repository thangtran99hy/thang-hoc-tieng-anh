00:02.391 --> 00:04.601
Gordon stood alone in the hall.

00:05.618 --> 00:07.966
He hadn't heard the bell to go inside.

00:09.064 --> 00:13.254
He had to go to music class, but he didn't know where to go.

00:14.291 --> 00:16.568
Gordon was a new kid at school.

00:17.627 --> 00:20.920
He knew the music room wasn't on the first floor.

00:21.947 --> 00:24.019
His classroom was on the first floor.

00:25.039 --> 00:27.374
So, Gordon went up the stairs.

00:28.459 --> 00:29.837
He knew he had to hurry.

00:30.870 --> 00:32.350
His teacher would be worried.

00:33.403 --> 00:37.647
At the top of the stairs, Gordon turned right down the hall.

00:38.719 --> 00:40.637
On the left, he saw a door.

00:41.715 --> 00:43.877
It might be the music room, he thought.

00:44.910 --> 00:47.136
No, it was the art room.

00:48.195 --> 00:49.765
Gordon asked the teacher,...

00:50.760 --> 00:52.859
..."Do you know where the music room is?"

00:53.827 --> 00:54.523
"Sure."

00:54.984 --> 00:56.143
The teacher said.

00:57.241 --> 01:07.495
"Turn right out of this room. Go past the stairs. On your left, you'll see a door like this one. That is the music room."

01:08.613 --> 01:11.411
Gordon thanked her and hurried down the hall.

01:12.412 --> 01:15.981
Gordon's teacher, Mr. Lewis, was outside the music room.

01:17.053 --> 01:18.083
"There you are!"

01:18.603 --> 01:19.781
Mr. Lewis said.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.853
"Mr. Green asked me to find you."

01:23.893 --> 01:25.097
Gordon smiled.

01:26.148 --> 01:27.971
"I found you first!"
