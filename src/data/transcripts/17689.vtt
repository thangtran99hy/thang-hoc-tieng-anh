Excuse me, do you know where the art room is?

00:05.819 --> 00:08.107
Sure. It is on the fifth floor.

00:08.675 --> 00:11.122
Use the elevator and go to the fifth floor.

00:12.121 --> 00:15.141
Is it easy for me to find it on the fifth floor?

00:16.285 --> 00:18.616
You have to turn right out of the elevator.

00:19.133 --> 00:20.372
Then go past the stairs.

00:21.030 --> 00:23.085
On your left, you will see the art room.

00:24.165 --> 00:25.069
Thanks a lot.

00:26.157 --> 00:28.653
It is easy to find. You can't miss it.

Gordon was a new kid at school, and he stood alone in the hall.

00:42.427 --> 00:48.377
He had to go to music class, but he didn't know where to go.

00:49.745 --> 00:56.320
The music room wasn't on the first floor. He went up the stairs.

00:57.197 --> 01:03.469
He knew he had to hurry cause his teacher would be worried.

01:04.933 --> 01:10.922
At the top of the stairs, he turned right down the hall.

01:12.425 --> 01:18.900
On the left, he saw a door. Oh, No! It was the art room.

01:19.934 --> 01:26.212
He turned right out of that room, and went past the stairs.

01:27.413 --> 01:32.969
On the left, he saw a door. That is the music room!
