00:01.473 --> 00:03.927
Everybody, sit down and open your book.

00:04.526 --> 00:06.461
Paul, why are you standing there?

00:07.496 --> 00:09.455
I have no chair to sit on.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.646
There is an empty seat next to Sally.

00:13.745 --> 00:15.219
Oh, there is one.

00:15.769 --> 00:17.439
May I sit next to you, Sally?

00:18.577 --> 00:19.919
Of course you can.

00:20.993 --> 00:21.683
Thanks.

00:27.573 --> 00:34.073
I am a detective. And I have my first mystery to solve.

00:34.817 --> 00:41.304
My sister Clare left her bear in the chair and she can't find it.

00:42.579 --> 00:49.025
I look on the chair, under the chair, and behind the chair.

00:50.071 --> 00:56.093
I follow our dog Chomps, and look in Chomps' bed.

00:57.570 --> 01:03.605
I see a sock, a ball, and Danny's rabbit. But no bear.

01:05.121 --> 01:10.651
I open Danny's old blanket, and I see Clare's bear!

01:12.478 --> 01:17.886
Chomps did not take the bear. It was Danny.

01:20.005 --> 01:26.533
Now Clare thinks I'm the best detective in the world.
