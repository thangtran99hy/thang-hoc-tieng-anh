Hi, Jake.

00:03.492 --> 00:06.170
Hi, Dora. What are you doing here?

00:07.203 --> 00:10.373
My puppy is missing. I'm looking for him.

00:10.604 --> 00:12.291
Have you seen my puppy?

00:13.309 --> 00:14.924
No, I haven't seen him.

00:15.323 --> 00:16.843
What does he look like?

00:17.709 --> 00:20.253
He is a small puppy with white fur.

00:21.215 --> 00:23.662
Do you want me to help you look for your puppy?

00:24.664 --> 00:25.819
Yes, please.

00:31.834 --> 00:37.266
Mother Bear wakes up. Her cub is missing.

00:39.275 --> 00:44.823
She looks for her cub in the cave. She can't find him.

00:46.864 --> 00:53.889
Mother Bear goes to Fox, Deer, Rabbit and Raccoon.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.715
"Have you seen my cub?

00:58.122 --> 01:01.236
He is missing, and I am worried.",...

01:01.875 --> 01:08.128
...Mother Bear asks them, but they say, "No, I have not.".

01:09.423 --> 01:15.626
Mother Bear hears a bee buzzing, and goes to the bee to ask,...

01:16.930 --> 01:24.113
..."Have you seen my cub? He is missing, and I am worried.".

01:24.435 --> 01:30.246
"Yes, I have. He is eating our honey.", says the bee.
