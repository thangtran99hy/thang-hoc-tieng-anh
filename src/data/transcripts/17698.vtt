00:02.645 --> 00:05.231
The winter holidays were here at last!

00:06.243 --> 00:10.007
It was Nami's job to make a special gift for everyone.

00:11.161 --> 00:12.947
It was her family's tradition.

00:14.547 --> 00:16.807
Grandma Kato loves plants.

00:17.831 --> 00:20.609
Nami made her grandma a flowerpot.

00:21.870 --> 00:24.077
Then, she put it in a red box.

00:25.220 --> 00:27.902
Grandpa Kato loves sugar cookies.

00:29.021 --> 00:31.418
Nami made her grandpa cookies.

00:32.547 --> 00:34.944
Then, she put them in a red box.

00:36.158 --> 00:38.270
Cousin Mika loves elephants.

00:39.365 --> 00:42.509
So Nami wrote her cousin an elephant story.

00:43.636 --> 00:45.938
Then, she put it in a red box.

00:47.390 --> 00:49.549
Uncle Yuri collects coins.

00:50.692 --> 00:54.327
So Nami made her uncle a large clay coin.

00:55.612 --> 00:57.819
Then, she put it in a red box.

00:59.295 --> 01:02.671
Nami didn't know what to make for Aunt Hoshi!

01:04.122 --> 01:06.898
She didn't know what was special to her aunt.

01:08.113 --> 01:09.654
Nami looked for clues.

01:11.319 --> 01:15.736
First, Nami saw that Aunt Hoshi had a baseball key ring.

01:17.140 --> 01:19.993
Then, Nami saw Aunt Hoshi's socks.

01:21.088 --> 01:23.295
They had tiny baseballs on them.

01:24.651 --> 01:29.542
Next, Nami saw Aunt Hoshi watching baseball on TV.

01:30.945 --> 01:33.011
Nami knew just what to do.

01:35.080 --> 01:38.523
At last, it was time for Nami to give her gifts.

01:39.936 --> 01:44.085
Each person smiled when they opened the gift made just for them.

01:45.338 --> 01:49.158
Aunt Hoshi jumped up when she took hers out of the box.

01:50.505 --> 01:52.051
"Let's play ball!"

01:53.184 --> 01:53.976
she called.

01:54.801 --> 01:58.373
Then she went to the basement holding her baseball and bat.

01:59.043 --> 02:02.681
The family played baseball late into the holiday night.
