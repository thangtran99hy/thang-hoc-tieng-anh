00:02.979 --> 00:04.227
Dong! Dong!

00:04.565 --> 00:06.442
There goes the grandfather clock.

00:06.817 --> 00:09.205
It's 2 a.m. Time to get up.

00:10.005 --> 00:12.329
I wonder what Becky and Dan are doing.

00:13.399 --> 00:15.869
Look at this! They're sound asleep.

00:16.091 --> 00:19.115
Lazy people! It's time to get up.

00:19.745 --> 00:20.875
I want to play.

00:21.727 --> 00:23.221
Come on! Wake up!

00:24.107 --> 00:25.134
Where's my mouse?

00:25.552 --> 00:27.534
I want to play with my mouse.

00:28.815 --> 00:30.493
"Go away, Alistair,"

00:31.337 --> 00:32.264
says Becky.

00:33.249 --> 00:36.002
Oh, you'd rather play What's Under the Blanket?

00:36.421 --> 00:39.143
Okay. Pounce! Pounce! Pounce!

00:40.287 --> 00:41.609
"Stop it, Alistair!"

00:43.027 --> 00:44.055
Says Dan.

00:45.267 --> 00:47.856
Hey! You just pushed me off the bed.

00:48.417 --> 00:50.222
I know you didn't mean to do that.

00:50.796 --> 00:54.302
Let's play something else, something that isn't so rough.

00:55.726 --> 00:57.999
"Okay, Alistair! Out you go."

00:59.463 --> 01:01.422
What? You can't put me out.

01:01.872 --> 01:03.257
I don't want to go out.

01:03.799 --> 01:05.166
I want to be with you!

01:06.179 --> 01:07.435
It's lonely out here.

01:08.343 --> 01:09.965
Come on. Let me in!

01:10.653 --> 01:14.768
If you don't let me in, I'll find another way to entertain myself.

01:16.133 --> 01:17.868
Don't say I didn't warn you.

01:18.555 --> 01:20.956
I know I'm not supposed to be up here.

01:21.686 --> 01:23.747
But you're not entertaining me.

01:25.005 --> 01:25.521
Oops.

01:26.082 --> 01:27.803
Don't worry, I'm okay.

01:28.604 --> 01:30.345
As for that vase, well.

01:30.919 --> 01:32.825
It was kind of ugly, don't you think?

01:33.795 --> 01:35.651
Now I'll find something else to do.

01:36.294 --> 01:38.497
Something that isn't so dangerous.

01:39.397 --> 01:42.193
I know! I'll play Kitty Super Hero!

01:43.475 --> 01:44.997
I'm watching for burglars.

01:46.137 --> 01:49.613
All clear to the east, but there's trouble to the west.

01:50.146 --> 01:51.371
Oh. It's you.

01:52.455 --> 01:53.030
"Honey?"

01:53.985 --> 01:54.902
Says Dan.

01:56.108 --> 01:57.165
"Where are you going?"

01:57.843 --> 01:59.238
"I can't sleep,"

01:59.840 --> 02:00.655
Says Becky.

02:01.688 --> 02:03.027
"I'm going to read."

02:03.601 --> 02:04.897
"Come on, Alistair,"

02:05.555 --> 02:06.449
Says Becky.

02:07.431 --> 02:08.817
"You can come with me."

02:10.023 --> 02:12.821
Well, okay, if you really want me to.

02:13.296 --> 02:16.184
But no love stories. I hate love stories.

02:17.481 --> 02:19.759
"Hey! Look what I found,"

02:20.233 --> 02:21.274
Becky says.

02:22.599 --> 02:24.301
My mouse. How nice.

02:24.951 --> 02:26.417
But I've had a tough night.

02:26.835 --> 02:28.070
I'm ready to sleep.
