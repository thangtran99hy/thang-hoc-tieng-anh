I wonder what Jack is doing.

00:05.503 --> 00:07.841
It is time that he should go to school.

00:08.852 --> 00:11.026
I'll find out what he is doing, Mom.

00:11.733 --> 00:15.990
Jack, what are you doing? Time to go to school!

00:17.227 --> 00:21.107
It's already 4 p.m. It's time to take a swimming lesson.

00:21.799 --> 00:24.484
I wonder how we are going to the swimming pool.

00:25.956 --> 00:28.661
Don't worry. Dad will give you a ride.

00:29.633 --> 00:31.881
Let's go out and play soccer, Jeff.

00:33.435 --> 00:38.171
Sorry, but I can't. It is time to do my math homework.

00:39.550 --> 00:44.129
Umm, you are always busy. I wonder when you can play with me.
