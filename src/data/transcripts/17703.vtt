Mom, there's a letter in the mail box.

00:06.584 --> 00:10.425
That's strange. We don't usually get mail on Sunday.

00:11.027 --> 00:13.561
Pass me the letter. I will look it up.

00:15.795 --> 00:17.276
What are you doing, Kevin?

00:18.280 --> 00:20.313
I'm playing computer games now.

00:21.141 --> 00:24.349
You don't usually play computer games on Monday.

00:24.877 --> 00:29.033
You'd better turn off the computer, and put the game CDs back.

00:29.896 --> 00:33.455
I was thinking of stopping playing games before Mom gets home.

00:36.103 --> 00:39.267
Mom, can I put on my pink dress today?

00:40.616 --> 00:42.967
You'd better not put on your dress today.

00:43.285 --> 00:44.703
It's windy outside.
