00:02.721 --> 00:03.910
Feeling Lonely

00:04.913 --> 00:10.583
Long ago and far away, a rich squire rode out to look over his land.

00:11.647 --> 00:14.267
He watched his field workers harvesting hay.

00:15.331 --> 00:20.148
The squire smiled, for he would soon be able to sell the hay for gold.

00:21.209 --> 00:24.001
A red leaf landed on the squire's nose.

00:25.066 --> 00:28.145
Then, more and more leaves floated on the air.

00:29.166 --> 00:33.111
He frowned, remembering how long and lonely winter was.

00:34.175 --> 00:36.914
The squire spotted a lovely girl in the field.

00:38.013 --> 00:40.952
"I shall make her my wife," he thought.

00:42.017 --> 00:44.630
"Will you marry me?" he asked.

00:45.645 --> 00:52.439
"You will have a big house and wear beautiful clothes," he said, but the girl refused his offer.

00:54.457 --> 00:55.689
A Promise Made

00:56.755 --> 00:58.193
The squire was angry.

00:59.097 --> 01:04.779
He promised to pay her father's debt if the father could get his daughter to marry the squire.

01:05.761 --> 01:12.009
"Arrange the wedding," said her father, "and when you are ready, send for my daughter."

01:12.929 --> 01:19.077
The squire's cooks spent days making a feast, and the maids cleaned his big house to a shine.

01:19.954 --> 01:22.929
He invited all the neighbors and hired the parson.

01:23.843 --> 01:27.455
When everything was ready, he sent a boy to the girl's father.

01:28.411 --> 01:33.876
"Tell him to send what he promised," the squire ordered, "and be quick."

01:35.829 --> 01:37.350
A Promise Fulfilled

01:38.341 --> 01:40.415
The boy hurried to the farmer's house.

01:41.394 --> 01:45.002
"My master said to send what you promised, and hurry."

01:45.948 --> 01:51.778
"Yes, yes," said the man, "she's in the field. Take her with you."

01:52.779 --> 01:55.001
The boy found the girl raking hay.

01:55.942 --> 02:00.457
He said, "I'm here to fetch what your father promised my master."

02:01.465 --> 02:08.489
"Oh, yes," she said, with a smile, "He means the little bay mare. She's at the edge of the field."

02:09.468 --> 02:13.549
The boy jumped on the mare's back and rode fast to the squire's home.

02:14.515 --> 02:18.300
"She's outside by the door," he told the squire.

02:19.257 --> 02:22.811
"Take her upstairs to her room," the squire said.

02:23.654 --> 02:27.897
The lad shook his head, but he knew better than to argue with the squire.

02:28.876 --> 02:32.725
He got seven men to push and pull the mare up the stairs.

02:34.690 --> 02:35.787
The Big Event

02:36.769 --> 02:41.497
When the women came to dress the bride, they stretched and tugged on the gown.

02:42.476 --> 02:46.192
They put flowers around her neck and a crown on her head.

02:47.091 --> 02:50.049
They pulled satin slippers on her front hooves.

02:50.987 --> 02:52.577
The music began to play.

02:53.528 --> 02:58.493
The guests turned to watch the door where the squire waited for his bride.

02:59.520 --> 03:05.207
There was a great clatter on the stairs, for the bride had only two satin slippers.

03:06.141 --> 03:07.235
The door opened.

03:08.207 --> 03:11.198
The squire never went courting again.
