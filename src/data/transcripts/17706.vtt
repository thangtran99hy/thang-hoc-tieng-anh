Hi, Karen. I saw you shopping for clothes the other day.

00:07.446 --> 00:10.880
You did? Why didn't you come to me and say hello?

00:11.944 --> 00:14.017
I was in a hurry to get somewhere.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.517
Anyway, how much do you spend on your clothes?

00:18.536 --> 00:22.776
Umm... I usually spend just 20 dollars buying my clothes.

00:25.803 --> 00:27.383
What are you doing, Brian?

00:28.333 --> 00:30.867
I'm trying to solve these math problems.

00:31.961 --> 00:34.390
Do you want me to help you with the math problems?

00:35.454 --> 00:36.464
Yes, please.

00:36.960 --> 00:39.413
I spent two hours on these problems.

00:39.765 --> 00:42.652
But I still don't know how to solve them.
