00:04.319 --> 00:08.288
A few nights passed and only half of the moon was left.

00:09.125 --> 00:12.262
The animals feared the moon would soon disappear.

00:13.290 --> 00:16.115
After a week their fears came true.

00:16.678 --> 00:18.365
The moon disappeared.

00:19.537 --> 00:24.691
They all ran to wise old Owl to tell him that the moon had disappeared.

00:25.582 --> 00:28.013
"You're all very silly,"...

00:29.217 --> 00:30.181
...said Owl.

00:31.412 --> 00:35.770
"Gather around and I will teach you a lesson about the moon."

00:36.793 --> 00:40.413
"There are two things you need to know about the moon,"...

00:41.791 --> 00:42.563
...said Owl.

00:43.400 --> 00:47.045
"First, the moon does not shine on its own.

00:47.678 --> 00:49.717
The sun lights up the moon.

00:50.486 --> 00:54.867
Second, the moon does not sit still in the sky.

00:55.359 --> 00:57.673
It moves around Earth."

00:58.709 --> 00:59.779
"Oh, yes,"...

01:00.791 --> 01:01.687
...said Owl.

01:02.273 --> 01:05.341
"There is one more thing you need to know.

01:06.054 --> 01:08.144
The moon is like a ball."

01:09.566 --> 01:13.515
"The sun can only light up one side of the moon

01:14.174 --> 01:22.023
So when the moon moves around Earth, you see only the part of the side that the sun lights up."

01:23.133 --> 01:28.801
Owl went on to say that sometimes you only see half of the lighted side.

01:29.313 --> 01:32.027
"This is called a half moon,"...

01:32.829 --> 01:33.558
...he said.

01:34.306 --> 01:38.272
"At other times you see all of the lighted side.

01:38.836 --> 01:41.226
This is called a full moon."

01:42.127 --> 01:46.471
"And sometimes you do not see the lighted side at all.

01:47.257 --> 01:48.923
You see the dark side.

01:49.581 --> 01:51.874
This is called the new moon."

01:52.554 --> 01:53.797
"But don't worry.

01:54.223 --> 01:56.372
The moon did not disappear,"...

01:57.597 --> 01:58.588
...said Owl.

01:59.659 --> 02:06.484
"Soon after a new moon, you will see a small part of the lighted side come back."

02:07.540 --> 02:12.368
The other animals began to feel better after listening to Owl talk.

02:13.620 --> 02:17.947
A few nights after Owl's lesson, the animals were out playing.

02:18.589 --> 02:22.903
Squirrel looked up and saw a small sliver of the moon.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.491
"Owl was right,"...

02:26.452 --> 02:27.637
...Squirrel yelled.

02:28.745 --> 02:31.011
"The moon is coming back!"

02:32.080 --> 02:34.387
The moon grew bigger each night.

02:34.931 --> 02:37.361
Soon there was a full moon again.

02:38.105 --> 02:40.965
The animals had a full moon party!
