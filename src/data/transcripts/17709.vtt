Do you know if Andy passed the exam or not?

00:07.391 --> 00:10.162
He feared that he couldn't pass the exam.

00:11.185 --> 00:11.603
No.

00:11.821 --> 00:13.958
He didn't say anything to me.

00:14.417 --> 00:16.689
But I'm pretty sure that he passed it.

00:19.949 --> 00:22.513
It suddenly starts raining heavily.

00:23.188 --> 00:25.232
I fear that it won't stop.

00:26.135 --> 00:28.305
Don't you have an umbrella with you?

00:29.557 --> 00:31.065
No, I don't.

00:31.881 --> 00:35.441
Call your mom and tell her that you need an umbrella.

00:38.145 --> 00:40.223
I broke my sister's crayons.

00:40.853 --> 00:43.513
I fear that she will be angry with me.

00:44.486 --> 00:48.156
Why don't you tell her that you are so sorry about it.
