00:02.322 --> 00:06.873
There was once a very rare creature called a pterodactyl.

00:07.777 --> 00:10.393
She had big, leathery wings.

00:11.367 --> 00:13.477
She had a big, bony beak.

00:14.294 --> 00:16.876
But her name she could barely speak.

00:17.919 --> 00:20.030
Her name was Pterodactyl.

00:21.039 --> 00:24.212
The pterodactyl couldn't say "Pterodactyl."

00:25.203 --> 00:28.377
The word got caught between her beak and tongue.

00:29.351 --> 00:31.497
She would take a big breath.

00:32.453 --> 00:34.807
She would scrunch up her beak and blurt,...

00:35.816 --> 00:38.206
..."Patero Whack Datal!"

00:39.214 --> 00:44.305
Now, if you can't say your name, it is very hard to meet someone new.

00:45.383 --> 00:48.749
One day, as she was flying along, she met a duck.

00:49.775 --> 00:50.823
The duck said,...

00:51.221 --> 00:54.465
..."Hi, I'm Duck. Who are you?"

00:55.543 --> 00:57.514
She took a deep breath.

00:58.471 --> 01:00.999
She scrunched up her beak and said,...

01:02.113 --> 01:09.033
... "Patero Patero Whack Whack Datal!"

01:10.024 --> 01:14.052
The duck thought she was making a rude noise and flew away.

01:14.991 --> 01:19.441
Later that day, she happened upon a small bird in a tree.

01:20.452 --> 01:22.019
The little bird chirped,...

01:23.079 --> 01:25.930
"Hi, I'm Wren. Who are you?"

01:27.059 --> 01:30.283
The pterodactyl took a really big breath.

01:31.322 --> 01:34.007
This time she was going to get it right.

01:34.979 --> 01:37.360
This time she was going to make a friend.

01:38.400 --> 01:43.291
Only this time, she said her name louder and worse than before.

01:44.291 --> 01:52.877
"Paw Paw Tero Tero Wrack Wrack Tow Tow Whack Whack Tile Tile Tattle!"

01:53.917 --> 01:57.092
Even worse, she burped at the same time.

01:58.063 --> 02:01.915
She blasted the little bird right off the branch.

02:02.896 --> 02:06.228
The pterodactyl was as sad as she could be.

02:07.239 --> 02:11.619
She had been sitting for a time when an owl landed beside her.

02:12.601 --> 02:13.874
"Who are you?"

02:14.218 --> 02:15.139
He asked.

02:16.179 --> 02:20.539
"I'm nobody because I can't pronounce my name."

02:21.011 --> 02:21.921
She said.

02:22.952 --> 02:25.382
"But you must be somebody."

02:25.755 --> 02:26.884
Chuckled Owl.

02:27.931 --> 02:29.494
"Because I know your name."

02:30.509 --> 02:33.204
"When you rip something, what do you do?"

02:33.617 --> 02:34.508
He asked.

02:35.538 --> 02:37.086
"You tear it."

02:37.371 --> 02:38.474
She answered.

02:39.547 --> 02:40.242
"Good."

02:40.606 --> 02:41.448
Said Owl.

02:42.557 --> 02:45.987
"And you use what to pin a paper to the wall?"

02:47.046 --> 02:48.543
"A tack."

02:49.575 --> 02:51.055
She answered brightly.

02:52.103 --> 02:59.951
"Now make the T in tack a D and set it next to this tree, which is really what?"

03:00.946 --> 03:01.729
"Tall!"

03:03.161 --> 03:04.052
She laughed.

03:05.063 --> 03:06.954
"Now put it all together."

03:07.407 --> 03:08.250
He whooed.

03:09.474 --> 03:14.370
"Tear Tear-A A-Dack Dack-Tall."

03:15.421 --> 03:16.434
"You got it."

03:18.836 --> 03:21.099
Laughed Owl as he flew away.

03:22.100 --> 03:29.353
"I'm an owl and you are a pterodactyl. Tear A Dack Tall!"

03:30.305 --> 03:36.126
From then and thereafter, the pterodactyl had lots of friends.

03:37.088 --> 03:41.165
Together they sat on the bending branch and sipped tea.

03:42.215 --> 03:43.360
She would murmur,...

03:44.371 --> 03:55.309
..."You are Wren. You are Duck. I am the Tear Tear-A A-Dack Dack-Tall, Pterodactyl!"

03:56.415 --> 04:00.669
And she was, and she is to this very day.
