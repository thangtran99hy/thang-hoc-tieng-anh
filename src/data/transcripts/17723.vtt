Japan's female wrestlers take to the mat ahead of the Olympics.

00:08.571 --> 00:15.887
Now, despite her small stature, wrestler Saori Yoshida could be the most intimidating athlete in her sport.

00:16.747 --> 00:22.563
She's never tasted defeat at an Olympics before and she certainly doesn't plan to later this year.

00:24.087 --> 00:28.221
She says, "I felt fear before and I remember it in a positive way;...

00:28.450 --> 00:31.807
...that's how I turn myself into someone who doesn't lose."

00:33.193 --> 00:37.578
Well, whoever comes up against Yoshida and her team in London had better be prepared,...

00:37.771 --> 00:40.251
...it looks like they have a fight on their hands.
