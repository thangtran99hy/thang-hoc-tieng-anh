In the history of the Olympic games, no athlete has been more dominant than Michael Phelps...

00:09.606 --> 00:12.513
...with an unprecedented 14 gold medals.

00:12.899 --> 00:15.484
Being able to represent your country and wear the stars and stripes...

00:15.607 --> 00:17.676
...is something that I'm happy and had the privilege to do.

00:17.905 --> 00:21.978
A powerful force in the pool with an arm span of over six and a half feet,...

00:22.383 --> 00:25.229
...he has shattered over 37 world records.

00:26.540 --> 00:31.143
If I want to achieve something, nothing is going to stand in my way, nothing.

00:31.997 --> 00:38.010
Michael Phelps, the man they call the "Baltimore Bullet" is ready to blow the competition away.
