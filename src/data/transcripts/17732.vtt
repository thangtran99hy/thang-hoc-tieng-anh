It's great to see so many people out and beautiful Cornish morning here at Land's End and a very special moment for everybody.

00:16.919 --> 00:21.354
It was an amazing moment and they're just proud to cooperate when involved with bringing the Olympics here.

00:21.550 --> 00:25.349
Hopefully this can build up throughout the country and that's one of the great things about the torch,...

00:25.449 --> 00:29.917
...it gives everyone the chance to feel a part of the olympics and really build that up to the games.

00:32.384 --> 00:36.174
Accepting the flame off Ben Ainslie was one of the best things that ever happened to me.

00:42.815 --> 00:47.595
To be part of something that you couldn't ever imagine that you were gonna take part in,...

00:47.791 --> 00:52.195
...and here you are at Land's End, holding this torch, it's just remarkable.

01:07.819 --> 01:13.971
The only way to describe it is like a carnival act: everyone's happy, everyone's chanting, everywhere I look there are children with...

01:14.311 --> 01:17.009
...homemade torches that they've made at home or in the classroom.

01:17.391 --> 01:20.174
And for me that sums up what the torch relay is all about.

01:20.931 --> 01:22.967
It's a huge privilege, a massive honor.

01:27.564 --> 01:30.767
Four, three, two, one.
