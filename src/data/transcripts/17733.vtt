00:01.642 --> 00:03.585
Ponce de Leon was way off.

00:03.697 --> 00:06.045
The fountain of youth is clearly in Japan.

00:06.505 --> 00:09.692
What's up everybody? I'm Patrick Jones. This is your Buzz 60.

00:10.108 --> 00:14.759
70-year-old equestrian Hiroshi Hoketsu has qualified for the London Olympics.

00:14.827 --> 00:21.653
He's made Olympic appearances before in '64 and '88, and was the oldest Olympian in Beijing in 2008.

00:21.826 --> 00:26.880
If Japan sends Hoketsu this summer, he'll again have that honor at the ripe age of 71.

00:27.090 --> 00:29.873
However, that won't make him the oldest Olympian ever.

00:30.077 --> 00:38.633
That honor goes to Oscar Swahn of Sweden, who competed in the 1920 single shot running deer rifle event at the age of 72.

00:38.876 --> 00:41.417
Hoketsu hasn't seen too much success in the Games,...

00:41.504 --> 00:45.735
...but he comes from a country that honors their elders and doesn't have this mentality.

00:45.919 --> 00:53.446
Hey, I guess they're right. Senior citizens, although slow and dangerous behind the wheel, can still serve a purpose.

00:55.054 --> 00:55.838
I'll be right back.

00:55.941 --> 00:57.211
Don't you go dying on me!

00:59.017 --> 01:00.178
That's success enough.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.436
Buzz 60. Now you know, pass it on.
