00:03.062 --> 00:07.299
I'm Nastia Liukin, we're here at WOGA Gymnastics in Plano, Texas.

00:09.035 --> 00:10.920
I'm so over the hill at 22.

00:11.813 --> 00:18.851
I think it just makes it that much more of a challenge to prove to people that I still can be competing at that level.

00:19.469 --> 00:20.578
For me in 2008,...

00:20.959 --> 00:24.217
...I definitely achieved that lifelong dream of winning the all-around gold medal.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.464
Now, it's like a whole different journey.

00:26.569 --> 00:29.975
I really feel like I can help out the team on my two strongest events,...

00:30.269 --> 00:31.160
...which are the bars and beam.

00:31.945 --> 00:36.264
I definitely feel like my dad being my coach gave me a little bit of an advantage.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.250
Not only did he compete at the Olympic games,...

00:38.563 --> 00:40.019
...but he won two gold and two silver medals.

00:40.145 --> 00:42.294
So it was like he knew exactly what it took.

00:42.892 --> 00:46.235
We're both perfectionists: we both always want to win.

00:46.679 --> 00:50.577
Second place is not gonna cut for me. Never did, never will.

00:50.795 --> 00:52.575
I always say that we're Team Liukin.

00:52.741 --> 00:55.133
It's like a triangle: there's three parts of it.

00:55.397 --> 00:58.416
Team Liukin is the strongest in the world; number one.

00:58.693 --> 00:59.907
And that's why it'll happen.

01:00.115 --> 01:02.440
It was a team effort: Larry was the coach,...

01:02.754 --> 01:05.116
...I was the supporter; kind of like a cheerleader, you know.

01:06.163 --> 01:10.024
Coming back to 2012, it's different for me than it was in 2008.

01:10.298 --> 01:16.565
I think about where I am today and what I need to get to to have another one of those golden moments in London.

01:17.465 --> 01:20.075
All those people cheering at once just gives me goose bumps.

01:20.346 --> 01:23.366
And you know, those are the moments that we kind of live for and that we train for it.

01:23.637 --> 01:24.941
There's no greater feeling than that.
