00:03.047 --> 00:03.868
Impossible?

00:07.327 --> 00:09.720
What is impossible?

00:14.374 --> 00:20.056
Was it impossible for the humble son of an Alabama cotton farmer...

00:20.721 --> 00:23.388
...to enter the politically charged arena of Berlin,...

00:24.619 --> 00:27.918
...win four gold medals, the hearts of the world...

00:28.384 --> 00:33.249
...and become the true message and lasting memory of the 1936 Olympics?

00:41.701 --> 00:45.635
Was it impossible for a young girl...

00:46.610 --> 00:50.612
...who, at the age of six, was diagnosed with incurable polio,...

00:52.665 --> 00:56.734
...whose doctors told her she would require leg braces for the rest of her life,...

00:58.033 --> 01:00.947
...to go on to win three gold medals in Rome?

01:08.332 --> 01:15.772
Was it impossible for an athlete who one day decided...

01:15.962 --> 01:19.019
...to jump over the bar backwards instead of forwards,...

01:19.859 --> 01:22.751
...who was laughed at and booed at every track meet,...

01:23.724 --> 01:27.911
...to go on to win gold and revolutionize his sport in the process?

01:36.396 --> 01:42.100
Was it impossible for a man who barely qualified for the Olympic finals...

01:42.745 --> 01:45.905
...to take off into the thin air of Mexico City...

01:47.161 --> 01:52.353
...and land somewhere in the next century, shattering a world record...

01:52.820 --> 01:57.353
...that had hardly changed over four decades by 55 centimeters?

02:05.233 --> 02:10.656
Was it impossible that the first gymnast to score a perfect ten...

02:11.819 --> 02:19.943
...would also be the second to score a perfect ten, the third, the fourth,...

02:21.366 --> 02:29.447
...the fifth, the sixth and the seventh at the age of 13?
