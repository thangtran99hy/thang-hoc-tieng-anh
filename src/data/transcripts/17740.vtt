My name is Lauren Mitchell and I'm an Australian gymnast.

00:04.040 --> 00:09.494
I've been doing gymnastics for about 14 years now, going towards London 2012 Olympics.

00:10.433 --> 00:13.782
A normal training day for me would be getting up at 5:30 in the morning,...

00:14.237 --> 00:16.860
...having breakfast, going to training for about three hours,...

00:17.457 --> 00:20.126
...and then I either have Pilates, or work or uni.

00:20.675 --> 00:23.241
And then go back in the afternoon for about three and a half hours,...

00:23.309 --> 00:26.349
...and then go home, eat dinner, go to bed, ready for the next day.

00:26.749 --> 00:32.169
I guess the one thing that I sacrifice is probably my schooling and my social life, a little bit.

00:32.651 --> 00:35.583
I guess what drives me to compete is I'm kind of a perfectionist.

00:36.031 --> 00:39.007
And I always want to be better than the person before me.

00:40.163 --> 00:44.503
Our training regime at the moment, I'm preparing for little competitions here and there.

00:44.711 --> 00:48.711
But overall, we'll have a really good solid six weeks right before London...

00:48.818 --> 00:51.223
...where we just knuckle down and do routine, routine, routine and...

00:51.779 --> 00:54.392
...just kind of get it all perfect and perfect it just then.

00:54.946 --> 00:56.822
For me, I think it's a real mental game,...

00:57.048 --> 00:59.773
...because you have the training and the workload is all behind you.

00:59.841 --> 01:04.601
It's just how you can handle yourself in the competition and performance phase.

01:06.480 --> 01:10.996
A sponsor like Visa has been fantastic, not only for me but for my family...

01:11.059 --> 01:14.503
...and for my coaches and the whole gymnastics community.

01:14.577 --> 01:17.944
Just so that we are able to get recognized and I'm able to get recognized.

01:18.007 --> 01:22.393
And help us get on with our job and just focus on what we need to do...

01:22.471 --> 01:24.796
...rather than all the other outside factors.

01:25.381 --> 01:26.959
Yeah, it's been really helpful in that way.
