00:00.406 --> 00:01.964
On the uneven bars.

00:02.624 --> 00:05.703
Chris, this could be the highlight of the compulsory event.

00:05.787 --> 00:10.509
She is one of the technically strongest, best gymnasts that I have ever seen.

00:11.638 --> 00:12.262
Watch this.

00:13.601 --> 00:15.898
Beautiful rhythm, right to a handstand.

00:17.105 --> 00:18.405
Oh, look at that amplitude.

00:21.638 --> 00:22.941
She is really moving well.

00:24.980 --> 00:26.453
Another handstand, look at that!

00:26.529 --> 00:27.701
Right to the handstand.

00:28.869 --> 00:31.795
Gorgeously shaped. Beautiful, and the crowd loves it.

00:32.465 --> 00:33.964
It wasn't just the crowd that loved it.

00:35.029 --> 00:35.868
There it is!

00:36.125 --> 00:38.780
A perfect ten for the first time.

00:39.087 --> 00:41.959
No gymnast in Olympic history had ever received a perfect score.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.935
And to do it with a compulsory routine was phenomenal.

00:45.269 --> 00:49.457
It brought the crowd to its feet and brought Nadia back onstage for a curtain call.
