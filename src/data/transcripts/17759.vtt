00:04.692 --> 00:10.691
Thank you, President Christ, so much. The board of trustees, distinguished alumnae,...

00:11.356 --> 00:16.474
...my fellow honorary degree recipients, who I am so proud to be in the company of,...

00:17.361 --> 00:23.958
...we have an architect, a climate scientist, a writer and I get to talk because I'm on Glee.

00:25.872 --> 00:27.009
What a world we live in.

00:28.802 --> 00:33.647
Parents and friends, and of course, all of you, the Smith College, Class of 2012!

00:37.777 --> 00:42.154
You ladies are about to receive a piece of paper...

00:42.212 --> 00:45.479
...that proves to the world you are now fit to join the ranks...

00:45.942 --> 00:50.275
...of an elite and tremendously powerful group of game-changing women.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.972
The Smith Class of 2012.

00:56.796 --> 01:05.481
Smith women have transformed cuisine, spearheaded social movements, created great literature...

01:06.149 --> 01:10.509
...and, in the case of my friend Piper, class of '92, even gone to prison.

01:12.833 --> 01:15.153
But damn it! When a Smithie goes to prison,...

01:15.219 --> 01:17.625
...she writes a clever and compelling book about it.

01:22.260 --> 01:26.749
Just know, the fact that you sit here on a chair assigned to you,...

01:27.279 --> 01:31.871
...with your bright, shiny faces, looking gorgeous in your caps and gowns,...

01:32.910 --> 01:34.599
...just know, you're welcome.

01:36.974 --> 01:41.670
You've actually done far more than I was able to accomplish back...

01:41.770 --> 01:45.068
...on my college graduation day back in 1982.

01:45.531 --> 01:48.331
You are women of Smith.

01:48.933 --> 01:52.557
You are fiercely independent, you are wickedly smart,...

01:52.851 --> 01:57.457
...trailblazing, uber confident and shockingly entitled.

01:59.483 --> 02:03.725
But in this moment, young ladies and Ada Comstocks,...

02:06.308 --> 02:11.119
...on this most auspicious of days, I want you to take a breath and reflect.

02:11.691 --> 02:13.339
Don't blow through this day,...

02:13.393 --> 02:16.427
...even if you are overwhelmed with family or maybe you're just a little bit drunk.

02:19.245 --> 02:20.125
Take a breath.

02:21.075 --> 02:26.228
You have successfully completed a journey at an exceptional institution of learning,...

02:26.702 --> 02:28.211
...and attention must be paid.

02:29.117 --> 02:31.690
I tell you, If I could do so much of my life over,...

02:31.790 --> 02:34.244
...I would have taken more moments like this to breathe.

02:34.716 --> 02:37.870
I would have spent more time focusing on what was right in front of me,...

02:38.111 --> 02:43.657
...instead of recoiling from what is because it didn't look or feel exactly as I imagined it.

02:44.221 --> 02:49.129
I wouldn't have been forever trying to look around the corner to see, "What's next, what's next?"

02:49.785 --> 02:51.640
I'd have taken in the beauty of the moment,...

02:52.327 --> 02:56.877
...and greeted everything in my life with a big "YES, AND",...

02:57.319 --> 03:04.010
...which leads me to what I'd like to talk to you about today, and today is all about you.

03:05.125 --> 03:06.503
But just a little bit about me.
