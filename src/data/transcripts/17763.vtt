We're gonna start discussing men's brains, women's brains...

00:07.959 --> 00:09.623
...and how they're very different from each other.

00:09.709 --> 00:12.696
Now, I wanna start with men's brains, all right?

00:12.821 --> 00:15.174
Now, men's brains are very unique.

00:15.307 --> 00:17.429
Men's brains are made up of little boxes.

00:18.465 --> 00:20.465
And we have a box for everything.

00:21.027 --> 00:24.092
We've got a box for the car, we've got a box for the money.

00:24.317 --> 00:27.862
We've got a box for the job, we've got a box for you, we've got a box for the kids,...

00:27.968 --> 00:30.424
...we've got a box for your mother somewhere in the basement.

00:33.769 --> 00:35.177
We got boxes everywhere.

00:36.183 --> 00:39.147
And the rule is: the boxes don't touch.

00:40.776 --> 00:46.332
When a man discusses a particular subject, we go to that particular box,...

00:47.212 --> 00:56.931
...we pull that box out, we open the box, we discuss only what is in that box, all right?

01:00.457 --> 01:02.851
And then we close the box and put it away,...

01:02.932 --> 01:08.073
...being very, very careful not to touch any other boxes.

01:08.906 --> 01:11.553
Now, women's brains are very, very different from men's brains.

01:12.010 --> 01:14.682
Women's brains are made up of a big ball of wire.

01:17.228 --> 01:21.246
And everything is connected to everything.

01:24.024 --> 01:26.529
The money's connected to the car and the car's connected to your job...

01:26.640 --> 01:30.435
...and your kids are connected to your mother and everything's connected to everything.

01:30.715 --> 01:30.980
And it's like...

01:39.616 --> 01:42.357
It's like the Internet superhighway, okay?

01:43.584 --> 01:47.001
And it's all driven by energy that we call emotion.

01:47.315 --> 01:51.995
It's one of the reasons why women tend to remember everything.

01:55.063 --> 01:59.669
Because if you take an event and you connect it to an emotion,...

02:00.033 --> 02:02.531
...it burns in your memory and you can remember it forever.

02:03.182 --> 02:05.669
The same thing happens for men, it just doesn't happen very often...

02:05.923 --> 02:07.901
...because, quite frankly, we don't care.

02:08.873 --> 02:12.731
Women tend to care about everything!
