When I was growing up, girls just didn't run in public.

00:04.501 --> 00:06.603
No one on my all boys team would pass to me.

00:06.754 --> 00:10.338
Dad told me I couldn't be a boxer, he said I was too small.

00:10.600 --> 00:14.053
There was a guy who tried to spit on me and then pushed me out of his way.

00:15.002 --> 00:17.139
There comes a point where you have to be sure of yourself.

00:17.359 --> 00:19.494
People aren't used to women being so passionate.

00:20.596 --> 00:21.232
It scares them.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.752
One day, I just said it doesn't matter what other people think.

00:25.097 --> 00:27.091
I'm a fashion model who can dunk.

00:27.259 --> 00:27.978
I'm a girl.

00:28.310 --> 00:29.886
That doesn't mean I have to wear a skirt.

00:30.170 --> 00:31.891
It doesn't mean I can't get all fired up.

00:32.433 --> 00:33.956
They used to say that girl is crazy.

00:34.320 --> 00:35.714
But then, I just kept winning.

00:36.025 --> 00:38.303
I didn't set out to dominate, I just did.

00:38.561 --> 00:40.181
Somebody has got to be the best.

00:40.459 --> 00:41.269
So why not me?

00:41.902 --> 00:45.284
I'm 55 years old and I run close to 70 miles a week.

00:45.833 --> 00:47.192
I never felt like quitting.

00:47.706 --> 00:51.335
There's something telling me to do it every single day.

00:55.509 --> 00:56.653
Just want to play ball.
