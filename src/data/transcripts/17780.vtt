Hi, this video is focused on the /z/ sound.

00:05.609 --> 00:08.908
/z/ is a voiced fricative consonant sound.

00:09.359 --> 00:15.399
So you should feel some friction or vibration between the tip of your tongue and the gum ridge.

00:16.502 --> 00:22.647
You make the /z/ sound by raising the tip of your tongue toward the gum ridge, but not touching.

00:23.273 --> 00:28.257
You should feel a vibration and buzzing between the tongue and the gum ridge.

00:28.815 --> 00:29.809
/z/

00:30.251 --> 00:38.692
One of the most common mistakes in making the /z/ sound is devoicing and turning it into a /s/ sound.

00:39.507 --> 00:42.586
This usually happens at the end of a word.

00:42.931 --> 00:47.561
So the word like "knees" ends up sounding like "niece".

00:48.351 --> 00:58.590
By the way, you should be aware that the /z/ sound is sometimes spelled with a letter 'Z' in English, but it is often spelled with a letter 'S'.

00:58.993 --> 01:01.432
So this can certainly be confusing.

01:02.777 --> 01:07.861
Let's work together and develop the energy we need for the /z/ sound.

01:08.843 --> 01:11.348
D, N, Z.

01:12.126 --> 01:14.655
D, N, Z.

01:15.349 --> 01:17.516
D, N, Z.

01:18.053 --> 01:20.825
Now, add the vowel e.

01:21.635 --> 01:24.335
Dee, Nee, Zee.

01:24.929 --> 01:27.930
Dee, Nee, Zee.

01:28.820 --> 01:34.675
Great! Now, let's try some words comparing /s/ and /z/ endings.

01:37.369 --> 01:40.027
Peas, Peace.

01:41.550 --> 01:44.021
His, Hiss.

01:45.135 --> 01:47.841
Pays, Pace.

01:48.964 --> 01:51.661
Plays, Place.

01:52.715 --> 01:55.295
Fleas, Fleece.

01:56.441 --> 02:04.120
Great! Now, let's try some words that are spelled with the letter 'S' but end with the /z/ sound.

02:04.661 --> 02:14.099
Remember, if the sound before the letter 'S' is voiced then the 'S'  is pronounced like /z/.

02:15.824 --> 02:17.104
Trees.

02:18.103 --> 02:19.101
Beds.

02:20.165 --> 02:21.359
Maids.

02:22.521 --> 02:24.107
Leagues.

02:24.681 --> 02:26.365
Hums.

02:27.234 --> 02:28.460
Pays.

02:29.197 --> 02:30.783
Sneezes.

02:31.917 --> 02:36.869
