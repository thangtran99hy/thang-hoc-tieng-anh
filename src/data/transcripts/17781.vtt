00:09.080 --> 00:12.597
As a competitor and an athlete, I never really look at anything stopping me.

00:16.325 --> 00:18.548
You know, you always fear the injuries.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.700
But where I am now in my career,...

00:20.900 --> 00:23.810
...I know how much work I got to put in to be prepared for things like that.

00:28.147 --> 00:29.897
As a team, you always push each other.

00:30.041 --> 00:32.659
I think we have the character and the guys to push each other so,...

00:33.150 --> 00:36.753
...I think the ultimate goal this year for me is to definitely win a championship.
