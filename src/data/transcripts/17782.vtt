For the London 2012 Games,...

00:08.801 --> 00:12.570
...Adidas has appointed one of Britain's most respected and accomplished designers,...

00:12.793 --> 00:16.187
...Stella McCartney, as our creative director for the British teams.

00:17.697 --> 00:20.459
I've been working with Adidas for nearly eight years.

00:21.063 --> 00:25.017
And it's been a really successful collaboration and being a British designer,...

00:25.157 --> 00:30.489
...working on the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics seem like such a natural thing to do.

00:35.271 --> 00:37.451
The Olympic first is that she's designed...

00:37.729 --> 00:41.405
...the actual performance kit the athletes will wear during the Games.

00:41.748 --> 00:43.094
Now that's never been done before.

00:43.606 --> 00:45.601
It's funny when you start to work in a project like this,...

00:45.675 --> 00:48.560
...you sort of go, "Oh my god. Where do you start?"

00:48.725 --> 00:52.653
And obviously the first place that you look is the Union Flag.

00:54.187 --> 01:00.851
I think that something that was really important to me was to try and use that iconic image...

01:00.964 --> 01:05.271
...and try and break it down and make it more graphic and more fashionable in a sense.

01:09.317 --> 01:14.340
Stella as a creative director brought in all the style and the fashion aspect,...

01:14.461 --> 01:17.094
...whereas Adidas had the technical expertise.

01:17.271 --> 01:21.899
The three key apparel innovations are our latest ClimateCool technology,...

01:22.164 --> 01:25.471
...ensuring the athletes keep cool and dry when they're performing.

01:26.054 --> 01:30.033
Our Techfit PowerWeb technology improves an athlete's stability,...

01:30.299 --> 01:32.577
...making them stronger and giving them more power.

01:33.101 --> 01:38.225
And also the Adizero footwear, making athletes even lighter and faster than ever before.

01:41.735 --> 01:44.840
There's 600 athletes, over 26 disciplines.

01:45.226 --> 01:48.467
Everyone is wearing a very different piece of kit.

01:48.669 --> 01:51.812
To bring it all together and make them look and feel like a team...

01:52.062 --> 01:54.178
...is an incredibly important part of the process.

01:56.690 --> 01:58.261
I think the kit looks fantastic,...

01:58.344 --> 02:01.981
...and then there's a bit of twist with the design to have the Union Flag incorporated in.

02:02.193 --> 02:03.255
I think its really classy.

02:03.383 --> 02:05.566
This kit, not only does it feel great but it also looks great,...

02:05.791 --> 02:07.199
...so it makes our job a lot easier.

02:07.357 --> 02:12.503
It's such a unique and special opportunity for us, and we are going to look amazing.

02:12.695 --> 02:14.507
I think everyone is going to be super envious.

02:17.727 --> 02:21.120
I'm gonna be watching the Olympic Games like every other person in the world...

02:21.208 --> 02:25.487
...and I'm going to be just proud of the athletes.

02:25.631 --> 02:29.907
And then if they win, I'm probably gonna be pinching myself, actually.
