He slaughtered our men.

00:15.813 --> 00:16.507
Our brothers.

00:19.591 --> 00:20.217
Our sons.

00:23.529 --> 00:24.321
We will find him.

00:29.753 --> 00:31.249
We will have our revenge.

00:38.830 --> 00:39.621
Surprise!

00:39.701 --> 00:40.307
My god!

00:40.463 --> 00:41.852
I was just leaving you a message.

00:41.960 --> 00:42.981
We wanted to surprise you.

00:43.098 --> 00:44.515
Well, you succeeded.

00:48.292 --> 00:49.372
Welcome to Istanbul.

00:49.564 --> 00:50.619
Mom! Look at this.

00:50.823 --> 00:52.346
Oh! It's beautiful.

00:54.489 --> 00:55.742
Dad's the best, huh?

00:55.855 --> 00:56.946
Yes, he is.

01:01.303 --> 01:02.107
He's here.

01:06.924 --> 01:08.225
I want two or three of them.

01:08.443 --> 01:08.972
Alive.

01:11.258 --> 01:12.322
Listen to me carefully, Kim.

01:12.516 --> 01:13.971
Your mother is gonna be taken.

01:15.907 --> 01:17.291
And people are gonna come for you too.

01:17.479 --> 01:18.234
What are you going to do?

01:21.536 --> 01:22.307
What I do best.

01:27.849 --> 01:28.505
Where is she?

01:42.983 --> 01:44.129
You have 30 minutes.

01:44.254 --> 01:45.038
This is not a game.

01:46.933 --> 01:48.083
I will finish this thing.

01:48.691 --> 01:49.699
You'll just have to die.
