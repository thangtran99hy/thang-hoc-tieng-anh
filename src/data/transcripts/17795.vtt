It makes the brain feel as if time has passed about one percent its normal speed.

00:34.707 --> 00:37.049
If we play this right, we could take the whole city.

00:49.201 --> 00:52.556
800 million people living in the ruin of the old world.

00:55.359 --> 00:58.041
Only one thing fighting for order in the chaos.

01:00.757 --> 01:02.719
The men and women of the Hall of Justice.

01:05.716 --> 01:09.425
Peach Trees is the manufacturing base for all of the Slo-Mo in Mega City One.

01:09.643 --> 01:11.947
You know how often we get a judge up in Peach Trees?

01:12.871 --> 01:14.168
Well, you got one now.

01:16.476 --> 01:17.845
She has control of everything.

01:19.972 --> 01:21.457
Levels one to 200.

01:22.677 --> 01:25.875
This is Ma-Ma. Somewhere in this block are two judges.

01:25.977 --> 01:26.680
That's not good.

01:27.563 --> 01:28.371
I want them dead.

01:29.897 --> 01:31.326
We're gonna have to go through them.

01:31.660 --> 01:32.689
Rookie, you ready?

01:35.249 --> 01:35.586
Yeah.

01:35.803 --> 01:36.577
You look ready.

01:38.112 --> 01:38.729
Fire!

01:43.069 --> 01:44.419
Judgment time.

01:44.499 --> 01:45.287
Let's finish this.

01:48.294 --> 01:49.823
Ma-Ma is not the law.

01:50.941 --> 01:51.747
I'm the law.

02:11.943 --> 02:13.105
Negotiation is over.

02:17.078 --> 02:18.700
The sentence is death.
