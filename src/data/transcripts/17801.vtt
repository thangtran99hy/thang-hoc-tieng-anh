On a typical day at school, endless hours are spent learning the answers to questions.

00:14.312 --> 00:16.408
But right now we'll do the opposite.

00:17.799 --> 00:21.953
We're gonna focus on questions where you can't learn the answers because there are none.

00:22.745 --> 00:25.449
I used to puzzle about a lot of things as a boy.

00:26.999 --> 00:30.019
For example, what would it feel like to be a dog?

00:30.571 --> 00:32.098
Do fish feel pain?

00:32.776 --> 00:34.119
How about insects?

00:35.297 --> 00:38.119
Was the big bang just an accident?

00:39.027 --> 00:40.131
Is there a God?

00:40.953 --> 00:44.259
And if so, how are we so sure that it's a him, not a she?

00:45.017 --> 00:48.289
Why do so many innocent people and animals suffer terrible things?

00:48.981 --> 00:50.928
Is there really a plan for my life?

00:51.997 --> 00:53.350
Is the future yet to be written?

00:53.795 --> 00:56.739
Or is it already written? We just can't see it.

00:57.208 --> 00:58.621
But then, do I have free will?

00:58.939 --> 01:01.639
Who am I anyway? Am I just a biological machine?

01:02.693 --> 01:04.389
But then, why am I conscious?

01:05.027 --> 01:06.288
What is consciousness?

01:07.098 --> 01:09.167
Will robots become conscious one day?

01:10.728 --> 01:16.051
Well, I kind of assume that someday, I would be told the answers to all these questions.

01:16.915 --> 01:18.813
Someone must know, right?

01:19.907 --> 01:22.190
Guess what? No one knows.

01:23.499 --> 01:25.819
Most of those questions puzzle me more now than ever.

01:26.328 --> 01:33.876
But, diving into them is exciting because it takes you to the edge of knowledge, and you never know what you'll find there.
