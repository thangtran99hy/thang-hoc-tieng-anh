Hi! This video focuses on the /ɛ/ sound.

00:05.686 --> 00:08.073
/ɛ/ is a front vowel sound.

00:08.511 --> 00:15.671
The tip of the tongue is relaxed and touching behind the lower front teeth for all vowel and diphthong sounds.

00:16.971 --> 00:22.702
To make the /ɛ/ sound, you need to release your jaw to a slightly open place...

00:22.772 --> 00:26.973
...and feel the front of the tongue a bit lower than the middle or the back.

00:27.902 --> 00:28.585
/ɛ/.

00:29.912 --> 00:38.193
A common challenge with the /ɛ/ sound is replacing it with the /ɪ/ sound or the /i/ sound.

00:38.611 --> 00:43.977
So, "Pet" sounds like "Pit" or "Pete".

00:44.951 --> 00:50.105
I've found that one of the ways that can help you correctly produce the /ɛ/ sound...

00:50.555 --> 00:54.940
...is feeling it in relation to the other three vowel sounds.

00:55.625 --> 00:57.653
Here's a little drill that you can try.

00:58.253 --> 01:03.585
Imagine that your mouth is a building and that the front of your tongue is an elevator.

01:04.081 --> 01:08.077
Note that the /ɛ/ sound is at the beginning of the word "Elevator".

01:08.943 --> 01:15.839
There are four floors to stop on and each floor corresponds with a front vowel sound.

01:16.379 --> 01:18.004
So, try this along with me.

01:18.349 --> 01:26.294
Use your hands to help remind your tongue what to do and to match your mouth with what my mouth is doing.

01:26.877 --> 01:31.945
So, the first floor is very high and that's your /i/ sound.

01:32.548 --> 01:34.259
/i/ very high.

01:35.091 --> 01:43.377
The /ɪ/ sound is the second floor, it's still high but a bit more open. /ɪ/.

01:43.834 --> 01:51.727
The /ɛ/ sound is the third floor. Now, notice how we're opening up here. /ɛ/, /ɛ/.

01:52.380 --> 01:58.797
And then the /ae/ sound is the fourth floor, the most open American front vowel sound. /ae/.

01:59.468 --> 02:05.085
So we can go /ae/, /ɛ/, /ɪ/, /i/.

02:05.710 --> 02:10.583
Let's try going up and down the front vowel elevator a few times together...

02:10.835 --> 02:13.575
...and try to match your sound with my sound.

02:14.237 --> 02:21.261
Here we go, /i/, /ɪ/, /ɛ/, /ae/.

02:21.955 --> 02:26.487
/ae/, /ɛ/, /ɪ/, /i/.

02:27.053 --> 02:28.359
/i/, /ɪ/, /ɛ/, /ae/.

02:28.926 --> 02:30.771
/ae/, /ɪ/, /ɛ/, /i/.

02:32.041 --> 02:37.310
Great! Now let's try some /ɛ/ sound sentences.

02:38.415 --> 02:40.562
Please check your cheek.

02:41.534 --> 02:44.287
She wants to sell the seal.

02:45.878 --> 02:48.795
He paid less rent on the lease.

02:50.315 --> 02:52.704
Ed won't miss this mess.

02:53.943 --> 02:56.511
She will rest her broken wrist.

02:57.777 --> 03:03.193
Be sure to try more /ɛ/ practice on EnglishCentral and good luck.
