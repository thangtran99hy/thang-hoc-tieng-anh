Hi! This video focuses on the /ɑ/ sound.

00:05.079 --> 00:10.169
A challenge with the /ɑ/ sound is that the speaker might not open the mouth enough...

00:10.290 --> 00:15.534
...so a word like "Hop" closes off to sound like "Hope".

00:16.493 --> 00:19.756
Let's try comparing some /ɑ/ and /oʊ/ words.

00:20.689 --> 00:23.581
Smock, Smoke.

00:25.011 --> 00:27.624
Rod, Road.

00:28.947 --> 00:31.436
Cop, Cope.

00:32.821 --> 00:35.372
Got, Goat.

00:36.652 --> 00:38.375
And now, a few sentences.

00:39.277 --> 00:41.147
John likes Joan.

00:42.331 --> 00:44.821
He has a clock in his cloak.

00:45.710 --> 00:47.800
That's not my note.

00:49.041 --> 00:52.644
