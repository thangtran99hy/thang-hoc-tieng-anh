Hi! This video focuses on the /ɔ/ sound.

00:05.341 --> 00:08.820
/ɔ/ is a back vowel sound where the lips are rounded.

00:09.258 --> 00:15.895
The tip of the tongue is relaxed and touching behind the lower front teeth for all vowel sounds.

00:16.951 --> 00:25.043
To make the /ɔ/ sound, you need to release the back of your tongue and bring your lip corners slightly forward like this.

00:25.891 --> 00:26.699
/ɔ/.

00:27.823 --> 00:33.036

00:44.705 --> 00:45.956

00:47.001 --> 00:48.561

00:49.720 --> 00:52.252
And, a few sentences.

00:53.938 --> 00:57.139

00:58.441 --> 01:01.983
