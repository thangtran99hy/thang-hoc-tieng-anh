Hi, this video focuses on the /aɪ/ sound.

00:05.380 --> 00:08.095
/aɪ/ is a front diphthong sound.

00:08.588 --> 00:16.258
Now remember, a diphthong is two vowel sounds that blend together so they almost feel like one.

00:16.981 --> 00:19.127
Notice the movement in my tongue.

00:19.724 --> 00:20.743
/aɪ/.

00:21.330 --> 00:27.965
To make the /aɪ/ sound, you need to start with the front of your tongue very released in the /ɒ/ position.

00:29.009 --> 00:29.665
/ɒ/.

00:30.385 --> 00:35.540
And then move the front of the tongue up toward the gum ridge to the /ɪ/ position.

00:36.533 --> 00:44.574
The second part of the diphthong is always shorter than the first, but you must make both sounds correctly.

00:45.079 --> 00:47.531
So let's try it together.

00:48.080 --> 00:51.418
We'll start slow and then we'll blend them to a normal pace.

00:51.710 --> 00:52.338
Here we go.

00:53.617 --> 01:00.865
/aɪ/, /aɪ/, /aɪ/, /aɪ/, /aɪ/, /aɪ/, /aɪ/, /aɪ/.

01:01.343 --> 01:01.905
Got it?

01:02.492 --> 01:07.889
Alright, there are a couple of challenges that can come up with the /aɪ/ sound.

01:08.432 --> 01:15.877
In one case, you might not be making both sounds of the diphthong so the /aɪ/ can sound like /æ/.

01:16.483 --> 01:21.561
That can cause a problem if you are trying to fly a "cat" rather than flying a "kite".

01:22.645 --> 01:27.667
The next challenge that can come up is the /aɪ/ sound becomes /ɔɪ/.

01:28.075 --> 01:32.567
So, do you want to buy new "ties" or new "toys"?

01:33.581 --> 01:41.667
Let's practice together. So in the first case, we're going to compare the /aɪ/ sound to the /ɒ/ sound.

01:42.392 --> 01:51.013
Notice that the tongue moves for the /aɪ/ sound but it holds the position for the /æ/ sound.

01:51.735 --> 01:53.793
So first, let's do a few word pairs.

01:54.939 --> 01:57.549
Vine, van.

01:59.005 --> 02:02.112
Fight, fat.

02:03.761 --> 02:06.804
Might, mat.

02:08.047 --> 02:11.141
Sight, sat.

02:12.547 --> 02:15.043
Alright, let's do a few sentences now.

02:16.300 --> 02:18.655
I got a bite from a bat.

02:19.913 --> 02:22.389
He lied to the lad.

02:23.781 --> 02:25.529
That side looks sad.

02:27.029 --> 02:33.655
Alright. Now, let's try comparing the /aɪ/ sound with the /ɔɪ/ sound.

02:34.464 --> 02:41.133
Now if this is your challenge, you need to move your initial vowel sound forward and relax your lips.

02:41.628 --> 02:42.764
So, watch my tongue.

02:43.691 --> 02:46.099
/aɪ/, /aɪ/

02:46.648 --> 02:49.910
Alright, let's try a few words comparing the two sounds.

02:50.705 --> 02:53.020
Buy, boy.

02:54.653 --> 02:57.643
Tie, toy.

02:59.149 --> 03:02.421
Vice, voice.

03:03.568 --> 03:09.055
