Hi! This segment is focused on the /b/ sound.

00:05.445 --> 00:07.734
/b/ is a voiced consonant sound.

00:07.873 --> 00:11.657
The /p/ sound is made in the same place, but without voice.

00:12.216 --> 00:18.052
/b/ is a plosive and that means that there is a lot of energy behind the sound.

00:19.167 --> 00:25.663
The /b/ sound is produced by bringing your lips tightly together and releasing a voice.

00:25.901 --> 00:27.739
Like this /b/.

00:29.269 --> 00:37.741
Two common challenges with this sound are either a lack of muscularity, so you lose the energy of the /b/...

00:38.347 --> 00:44.344
...or a devoicing of the sound so that it sounds like a /p/ rather than a /b/.

00:45.011 --> 00:48.687
Listen to the differences when I pronounce a few word pairs.

00:49.657 --> 00:51.974
Cap, cab.

00:53.282 --> 00:55.602
Rip, rib.

00:56.863 --> 00:59.286
Pup, pub.

01:00.841 --> 01:02.749
Alright. Now, let's practice.

01:03.577 --> 01:06.117
/p/, /p/, /p/, /p/, /p/, /p/, /p/, /p/, /p/, /p/.

01:06.293 --> 01:07.422
That's your voiceless.

01:07.804 --> 01:10.395
/b/, /b/, /b/, /b/, /b/, /b/, /b/, /b/, /b/, /b/.

01:10.609 --> 01:12.127
That's your voice to /b/ sound.

01:12.391 --> 01:13.565
Now let's try them together.

01:14.113 --> 01:19.693
/p/, /p/, /p/, /b/, /b/, /b/, /p/, /p/, /p/, /b/, /b/, /b/, /p/, /p/, /p/, /b/, /b/, /b/.

01:20.559 --> 01:25.489
Now, here are a few sentences comparing /b/ and /p/.

01:27.175 --> 01:28.647
I sat in your lab.

01:29.929 --> 01:31.423
I sat on your lap.

01:32.597 --> 01:34.267
What a beautiful robe.

01:34.965 --> 01:36.333
What a beautiful rope.

01:37.732 --> 01:39.144
The cab is yellow.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.339
The cap is yellow.

01:43.104 --> 01:47.912
Put this into play as you practice on EnglishCentral and good luck!
