Hi! This video is focused on the /tʃ/ sound.

00:06.394 --> 00:14.407
/tʃ/ is a voiceless consonant sound, and /tʃ/ is a combination of two different sounds, /t/ and /ʃ/.

00:14.826 --> 00:19.738
They blend together to create a sound that is felt and heard as one sound.

00:20.550 --> 00:28.071
So the way you can make this sound is taking the /t/ sound, which is produced by the tip of your tongue touching the gum ridge,...

00:28.728 --> 00:36.489
...and blending that into the blade of your tongue pointing toward the gum ridge but not touching to the /ʃ/ part of the sound.

00:37.385 --> 00:37.559
/tʃ/.

00:39.030 --> 00:44.630
The most common challenge with this sound is turning it into the /ʃ/ sound.

00:45.067 --> 00:49.655
So, a word like "cherry" sounds like "sherry".

00:50.475 --> 00:54.878
Now, let's practice. For this exercise you'll need a chopstick.

00:55.865 --> 00:59.604
So, please take a chopstick and scratch the tip of your tongue.

01:00.381 --> 01:02.949
Next, press on the gum ridge.

01:03.263 --> 01:07.445
That's the place where the gum starts, just behind your front teeth.

01:08.354 --> 01:14.925
Now let's try five tongue ups, touching the tip of your tongue to the gum ridge and releasing.

01:15.262 --> 01:15.879
Here we go.

01:16.262 --> 01:24.135
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

01:25.025 --> 01:31.589
Great! Now, let's move between the /t/ sound and the /ʃ/ sound.

01:31.995 --> 01:32.703
Here we go!

01:34.098 --> 01:38.884
/t/, /ʃ/, /t/, /ʃ/, /t/, /ʃ/.

01:39.539 --> 01:45.006
Can you feel the tip of your tongue touch and release, touch and release?

01:45.859 --> 01:51.668
This slow and specific work will help you find the placement of the /tʃ/ sound.

01:52.145 --> 01:54.467
So now, let's speed it up and put it together.

01:55.409 --> 01:58.951
/t/, /ʃ/, /t/, /ʃ/, /t/, /ʃ/, /t/, /ʃ/, /t/, /ʃ/, /ʃ/.

01:59.983 --> 02:04.062
Okay. Finally, we can combine them completely. It's almost like a train, right?

02:04.459 --> 02:05.244
So, here we go.

02:06.906 --> 02:11.698
/t/, /ʃ/, /t/, /ʃ/, /t/, /ʃ/, /tʃ/, /tʃ/, /tʃ/, /tʃ/, /tʃ/, /tʃ/, /tʃ/, /tʃ/.

02:12.481 --> 02:13.205
Great!

02:14.057 --> 02:21.241
Alright. Now, let's try some words contrasting the /ʃ/ sound with the /tʃ/ sound.

02:22.433 --> 02:26.023
Here are a few examples at the beginning of a word.

02:27.329 --> 02:30.191
Shore, chore.

02:31.933 --> 02:35.401
Shoes, choose.

02:36.719 --> 02:39.631
Shop, chop.

02:41.011 --> 02:44.053
Chin, shin.

02:45.568 --> 02:48.943
Now, let's try them at the end of a word.

02:50.449 --> 02:53.019
Leash, leach.

02:54.725 --> 02:57.229
Dish, ditch.

02:58.520 --> 03:01.233
Marsh, march.

03:02.318 --> 03:07.285
Try this out as you practice on EnglishCentral and good luck.
