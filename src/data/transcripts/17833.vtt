Hi! This video is focused on the /d/ sound.

00:05.184 --> 00:12.057
/d/ is a voiced plosive consonant and that means that there is a lot of energy behind the sound.

00:12.363 --> 00:21.857
The /d/ sound is produced by bringing the tip of your tongue to your gum ridge and releasing it like this /d/.

00:23.094 --> 00:28.080
One of the most common challenges with this sound is a lack of muscularity,...

00:28.541 --> 00:37.435
...so you lose the energy of the /d/ or a devoicing of the sound so that it sounds like a /t/ rather than a /d/.

00:37.805 --> 00:41.471
So listen to the difference when I pronounce a few word pairs:...

00:42.381 --> 00:44.439
Add, At.

00:45.958 --> 00:48.399
Bad, Bat.

00:49.749 --> 00:52.521
Planned, Plant.

00:53.717 --> 01:02.945
Also, the /d/ is a voiced sound, so you need to make sure that you carry your voice through the articulation of the sound.

01:05.036 --> 01:06.606
Okay, let's practice.

01:07.997 --> 01:10.615
/t/, /t/, /t/, /t/, /t/, /t/, /t/, /t/, /t/, /t/.

01:10.967 --> 01:12.034
That's the voiceless.

01:12.632 --> 01:15.217
/d/, /d/, /d/, /d/, /d/, /d/, /d/, /d/, /d/, /d/.

01:15.613 --> 01:16.511
That's the voiced.

01:16.711 --> 01:17.751
And let's put them together.

01:18.330 --> 01:23.793
/t/, /t/, /t/, /d/, /d/, /d/, /t/, /t/, /t/, /d/, /d/, /d/, /t/, /t/, /t/, /d/, /d/, /d/, /t/, /t/, /t/, /d/, /d/, /d/.

01:24.497 --> 01:30.913
Alright, now we're gonna try a few sentences together, comparing /d/ and /t/.

01:32.379 --> 01:33.785
I don't want to wade.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.290
I don't want to wait.

01:37.515 --> 01:39.123
She bought a card.

01:40.035 --> 01:41.471
She bought a cart.

01:42.699 --> 01:43.903
She made her bed.

01:44.835 --> 01:46.111
She made her bet.

01:47.537 --> 01:50.599
