Hi! This segment will focus on the /f/ sound.

00:06.890 --> 00:09.976
/f/ is a voiceless consonant sound.

00:10.547 --> 00:23.861
The /f/ sound is produced by placing your top teeth against your lower lip like this and releasing the air out like this /f/.

00:24.807 --> 00:31.283
I would say the most common challenge with this sound is a tendency to try to make it without enough tension...

00:31.538 --> 00:35.497
...between the teeth and the lower lip, so the sound lacks energy.

00:36.191 --> 00:37.495
Now, let's practice.

00:38.053 --> 00:46.301
Here's a nice exercise that will help you clarify your /f/ sound while also practicing your front vowel sounds.

00:46.728 --> 00:47.951
Let's try this together.

00:49.465 --> 00:56.386
/f/, /iy/, fee, /iy/, fee, if.

00:57.463 --> 01:02.637
/f/, /eh/, f, Fe, f.

01:03.631 --> 01:09.295
/f/, /eh/, f, /eh/, f.

01:10.266 --> 01:16.136
/f/, /ah/, f, /ah/, f.

01:17.092 --> 01:19.654
And now, let's try some words.

01:20.683 --> 01:21.862
Fan.

01:23.139 --> 01:23.985
Fill.

01:25.265 --> 01:26.077
Felt.

01:27.436 --> 01:28.571
Laughing.

01:29.553 --> 01:30.546
Sniffle.

01:31.340 --> 01:32.188
Fluffy.

01:33.838 --> 01:34.673
Goof.

01:35.454 --> 01:36.553
Stuff.

01:37.713 --> 01:38.485
Half.

01:39.981 --> 01:44.114
Try this out as you practice on EnglishCentral and good luck.
