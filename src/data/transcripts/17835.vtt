Hi. This video is going to focus on the /k/ sound.

00:05.373 --> 00:08.021
/k/ is a voiceless consonant sound.

00:08.403 --> 00:14.643
The /k/ sound is produced by bouncing the back of your tongue off of the soft palate.

00:15.234 --> 00:20.936
Think of it like a trampoline action in the back of your tongue, /k/,...

00:21.453 --> 00:26.338
...feel the back of your tongue jumping to touch the soft palate and release.

00:27.219 --> 00:31.616
The most common challenge with this sound is a lack of muscularity...

00:31.957 --> 00:37.040
...so you lose the energy of the /k/ and you might even drop the sound altogether.

00:37.737 --> 00:42.763
This can lead to a mumbling quality or can even change the meaning of the word.

00:43.565 --> 00:46.607
This tends to happen toward the end of words.

00:47.290 --> 00:50.659
Listen to the difference when I pronounce a few word pairs.

00:51.633 --> 00:54.064
Stack, sta.

00:55.493 --> 00:57.628
Pick, pih.

00:59.165 --> 01:01.325
Lock, la.

01:02.209 --> 01:05.235
Can you hear and feel the energy of /k/?

01:05.811 --> 01:10.035
You see, there is a big bounce happening and a release of air on the sound.

01:10.587 --> 01:12.314
Now, let's practice together.

01:12.805 --> 01:18.629
Here's an exercise that can help you develop more energy and action in the back of the tongue.

01:19.310 --> 01:21.684
I call it, "Trampoline for the K".

01:22.871 --> 01:27.341
Try using your hands like I do to mirror what is happening in your mouth.

01:28.019 --> 01:33.545
The goal for this is to actually inhale and exhale on the /k/ sound.

01:33.962 --> 01:36.026
Let's try that together a few times.

01:36.784 --> 01:41.730
/k/, /k/, /k/, /k/, /k/, /k/.

01:42.117 --> 01:49.307
You can actually do this 10 or 20 times on your own and feel that trampoline bounce each time.

01:50.443 --> 01:54.161
Now, let's try a few words with that action of the /k/

01:56.046 --> 01:56.844
Cat.

01:58.090 --> 01:58.949
Kick.

02:00.456 --> 02:01.336
Kept.

02:03.361 --> 02:04.311
Prickle.

02:05.015 --> 02:06.221
Snacking.

02:06.938 --> 02:08.106
Slacker.

02:09.887 --> 02:10.529
Back.

02:11.919 --> 02:12.612
Tech.

02:13.906 --> 02:14.664
Flick.

02:16.739 --> 02:21.110
Try this out as you practice on EnglishCentral and good luck!
