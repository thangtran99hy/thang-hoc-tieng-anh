So English mania is a turning point.

00:03.696 --> 00:08.043
Like the harnessing of electricity in our cities or the fall of the Berlin Wall.

00:08.585 --> 00:12.178
English represents hope for a better future.

00:12.804 --> 00:16.157
A future where the world has a common language...

00:16.751 --> 00:18.960
...to solve its common problems.

00:19.601 --> 00:20.196
Thank you very much.
