How to Buy a First-Year Wedding Anniversary Gift.

00:06.502 --> 00:10.473
A first-year wedding anniversary is an important celebration for you and your spouse.

00:10.657 --> 00:14.113
Use this guide to make sure the gift is as memorable as the past year.

00:14.533 --> 00:25.271
You will need a wall map, a picture, a frame, board games, a tree, a star, a love note, and a shoebox.

00:25.844 --> 00:27.357
Optional: pushpins.

00:27.887 --> 00:30.122
Step one: Give them the world.

00:30.344 --> 00:32.491
Get your spouse a wall map to hang on the wall,...

00:32.762 --> 00:35.447
...a fun way to chronicle all your future adventures together.

00:36.057 --> 00:40.973
Since paper is the traditional first anniversary gift, you'll be killing two birds with one stone.

00:42.301 --> 00:44.235
Use pushpins to mark all your trips.

00:44.766 --> 00:48.365
Step two: Blow up a funny picture of the two of you and frame it.

00:49.009 --> 00:51.478
Every time you walk by the picture, you will both smile.

00:52.314 --> 00:57.860
Step three: Slip a note in their pocket telling them to meet you where your first encounter took place.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.685
The surprise and subtlety will bring you both back.

01:01.423 --> 01:05.715
Step four: Get a collection of board games so you can play on cold or rainy days...

01:05.923 --> 01:07.799
...or with friends and family for a game night.

01:08.198 --> 01:11.103
Step five: Plant a tree together in your backyard.

01:11.385 --> 01:14.237
Watch your love grow and the tree grow over the years.

01:14.890 --> 01:20.558
Step six: Show your love is as wide as the universe by naming a star after your spouse.

01:21.093 --> 01:23.134
You'll always be able to see it glimmering.

01:24.214 --> 01:26.692
You can search online for a company that names stars.

01:27.047 --> 01:31.367
Terms like "star naming" or "name your own star" will yield several results.

01:31.807 --> 01:35.886
Step seven: Write a love note for your spouse and store it in a shoebox.

01:36.127 --> 01:38.509
Add a new love note to the box each year.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.115
Happy first anniversary!

01:40.599 --> 01:47.976
Did you know? In 2008, the average age for first-time marriages in the United States was 26 for women and 28 for men.
