Make your romance an affair to remember with a surprise marriage proposal.

00:10.564 --> 00:12.983
These ideas will help you catch your love off guard.

00:13.703 --> 00:18.207
You will need: Secrecy, randomness, timing and creativity.

00:19.208 --> 00:21.838
Step one: Tell no one.

00:22.365 --> 00:24.927
Even if friends and family don't slip up with words,...

00:25.182 --> 00:27.393
...they could give away the surprise with their behavior.

00:27.911 --> 00:32.026
If you need help with your surprise proposal, ask people who don't know your intended.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.960
Step two: Propose during an unplanned moment:...

00:36.366 --> 00:40.880
...a random day at a nothing special location that holds no meaning for either of you.

00:41.218 --> 00:44.038
It's an easy way to pull off a surprise marriage proposal.

00:44.300 --> 00:45.331
They won't be expecting it.

00:46.561 --> 00:49.887
Step three: Plan a romantic evening or weekend getaway.

00:50.241 --> 00:52.859
Something that has "wedding proposal" written all over it...

00:53.270 --> 00:55.659
...and then pop the question the day after you're back.

00:56.079 --> 00:57.843
Step four: Be creative.

00:58.258 --> 01:01.279
Make an online video proposal and have a friend send the link,...

01:01.423 --> 01:03.938
...saying it's a hysterical video they've got to watch.

01:04.269 --> 01:06.875
Or try a twist on the restaurant proposal.

01:07.278 --> 01:11.935
Arrange for the server to bring dinner on a plate that has "Will You Marry Me?" written on it.

01:12.410 --> 01:16.963
The message will slowly reveal itself as your future spouse makes her way through her meal.

01:17.959 --> 01:23.819
90 percent of women surveyed do not want to be proposed to at a sports event via Jumbotron.

01:24.273 --> 01:28.180
Step five: Incorporate your proposal into their daily routine.

01:28.464 --> 01:32.533
A marriage proposal will be the last thing on their mind, so it's sure to be a surprise.

01:32.950 --> 01:33.327
Good luck!

01:34.122 --> 01:34.820

01:35.180 --> 01:39.503
