We all know this scene.

00:16.046 --> 00:19.222
Dorothy closes her eyes and repeats the good witch's mantra:...

00:19.391 --> 00:27.890
..."No coordinates exist like one's domicile."

00:28.370 --> 00:32.162
Only Dorothy doesn't say that; she says five one-syllable words:...

00:32.335 --> 00:33.918
..."There's no place like home."

00:35.123 --> 00:39.920
Each a word you probably learned in your first year of speaking, each perfectly concise.

00:40.339 --> 00:43.116
It's not that L. Frank Baum didn't have a thesaurus,...

00:43.795 --> 00:46.507
...it's that in most cases, ten-dollar words fail.

00:47.527 --> 00:50.599
Would Aerosmith have had a hit with "Ambulate This Direction"?

00:51.299 --> 00:52.067
Probably not.

00:52.717 --> 00:55.433
Would Patrick Henry have ignited a revolution by saying...

00:55.887 --> 00:58.935
..."Provide me with liberty or bestow upon me fatality." 

00:59.465 --> 00:59.992
Unlikely.

01:01.101 --> 01:03.631
When it comes to words, bigger isn't always better.

01:04.746 --> 01:07.641
Ten-dollar words are rendered worthless if they're not understood.

01:08.385 --> 01:12.519
That's not to say every piece of literature should be written out of fourth grade reading level,...

01:13.099 --> 01:15.046
...but it is important to know your audience.

01:15.759 --> 01:20.644
If you're a novelist, your audience is probably expecting 300 pages of vivid descriptors.

01:21.181 --> 01:25.351
...at the very least, they're expecting you won't use the same 50 words to fill those pages.

01:26.110 --> 01:28.711
But most of us don't have the luxury of a captive audience.

01:29.291 --> 01:32.034
We're competing against a whole world of distractions,...

01:32.543 --> 01:37.255
...and we're fighting for space in an attention span that continues to shrink across generations.

01:37.969 --> 01:39.197
So get to the point already.

01:39.989 --> 01:43.721
Variety may be the spice of life, but brevity is its bread and butter.

01:44.479 --> 01:48.275
So when it comes to ten-dollar words, save your money and buy a Scrabble board.
