00:00.948 --> 00:02.779
Work on these four assumptions.

00:05.821 --> 00:07.556
They deal with the four parts of our nature.

00:07.810 --> 00:13.831
For the body: assume you had a heart attack, now live accordingly.

00:14.123 --> 00:18.717
For the heart: assume that everything you say about another person they can overhear,...

00:19.274 --> 00:20.332
...now speak accordingly.

00:21.007 --> 00:27.041
Always be loyal to the absent, if you want to retain the loyalty of those who are present.

00:28.473 --> 00:32.927
Integrity means you live by the same set of principles in the totality of your life.

00:35.713 --> 00:42.216
For the mind: assume the half-life of your profession is two years, now prepare accordingly.

00:43.539 --> 00:46.586
As we move into this knowledge economy in great speed,...

00:47.497 --> 00:50.445
...a constant need to invest in your education.

00:51.515 --> 00:55.906
Experiences like this, online education,...

00:57.204 --> 01:01.865
...getting back in the different training programs, school constant need for it.

01:04.384 --> 01:09.710
And then for the spirit, assume you had a one-on-one communication...

01:10.465 --> 01:13.574
...with your Creator, now live accordingly.

01:17.931 --> 01:25.407
The cultivation of these four parts to our nature develops at its highest level,...

01:25.531 --> 01:27.847
...what I call "vision for the mind."

01:28.039 --> 01:31.608
"Vision" means you have the sense of what's out there,...

01:32.165 --> 01:35.636
...you cannot see it, but you see it in your mind's eye.

01:36.141 --> 01:38.101
You see the potential in another person.
