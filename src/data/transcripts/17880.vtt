00:00.955 --> 00:02.575
Are you idealistic?

00:03.797 --> 00:04.693
Are you a dreamer?

00:05.761 --> 00:08.747
Do you see potential in others?

00:09.249 --> 00:12.625
Then you have some of the key qualities for creating vision.

00:12.954 --> 00:17.958
Each of us has immeasurable power to reinvent our own lives.

00:18.365 --> 00:19.677
So let's start at the beginning.

00:20.797 --> 00:24.273
What is your destiny? What is your unique mission in life?

00:24.689 --> 00:28.374
To develop your vision, simply use your imagination.

00:28.898 --> 00:36.087
You see, all things are created twice; first, in the mind and second, in physical reality.

00:36.573 --> 00:42.542
As you develop your vision, make sure it taps into your energies and gives you a sense of calling.

00:42.950 --> 00:47.907
Sometimes we let our history or our emotional scars limit our vision.

00:48.371 --> 00:52.711
But vision is more powerful than that, it is infinite.

00:52.971 --> 00:58.281
Remember, you do not have to know how to execute a vision in order to create it.

00:58.420 --> 01:03.013
As Einstein put it, imagination is more important than knowledge.

01:03.445 --> 01:10.663
You can free your mind to start envisioning a future which is defined by expressing your voice.
