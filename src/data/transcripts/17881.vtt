Hi! This segment video is focused on the /m/ sound.

00:05.910 --> 00:11.589
/m/ is a voiced nasal consonant sound and that means the sound comes out the nose.

00:12.358 --> 00:22.500
You make the /m/ sound by bringing your lips together and sending vibration and voice out your nose like this /m/.

00:23.205 --> 00:32.414
A common mistake with the /m/ sound is adding what's called an off-glide or an /É™/ sound at the end of a word.

00:32.937 --> 00:36.075
So that "team" becomes "team-uh".

00:37.022 --> 00:46.693
Occasionally, some speakers will shorten the /m/ and release the sound too quickly so it comes out sounding a bit like a /b/ sound.

00:47.064 --> 00:53.137
That would mean a word like  "me" sounds like "be" or a word like "hum" sounds like "hub".

00:54.549 --> 00:58.807
Let's try a few sentences keeping these challenges in mind.

01:00.085 --> 01:03.221
Mom likes the rhythm of the anthem.

01:04.921 --> 01:08.061
Adam filmed the game in the storm.

01:09.501 --> 01:12.945
Moody phantoms came out of the tombs.

01:14.031 --> 01:20.165
Have fun with the /m/ sound as you practice on EnglishCentral and good luck.
