Hi! This video is focused on the /n/ sound.

00:06.051 --> 00:10.433
The /n/ sound is a voiced nasal consonant sound.

00:10.879 --> 00:13.924
And that means the sound comes out the nose.

00:14.955 --> 00:23.821
You make the /n/ sound by releasing your jaw and bringing the blade of your tongue up toward your gum ridge and creating a seal.

00:24.537 --> 00:30.906
It's extremely important that the back of your tongue and the soft palate are relaxed.

00:32.543 --> 00:39.487
A common challenge with the /n/ sound is mixing it up with the /ŋ/ sound.

00:39.979 --> 00:44.763
So a word like "Gone" can end up sounding like "Gong".

00:46.692 --> 00:53.950
To help you find the correct placement of the /n/, let's take an easy yawn together like this.

00:54.927 --> 01:01.655
Notice the back of the tongue relaxing and notice the space between the back of the tongue and the soft palate.

01:02.285 --> 01:05.727
Now try the yawn again and this time when you finish,...

01:06.411 --> 01:14.005
...breathe in through the mouth and feel the cool air across the tongue and the space between the back of the tongue and the soft palate.

01:14.827 --> 01:22.458
Now, keep that space as you gently guide the blade of the tongue up for the /n/ sound.

01:23.498 --> 01:24.741
/n/.

01:25.176 --> 01:32.529
Let's try comparing the /n/ sound with the /ŋ/ sound at the ends of words.

01:33.003 --> 01:39.302
Remember, the back of your tongue must be relaxed for the /n/ sound.

01:40.166 --> 01:40.979
Here we go.

01:42.039 --> 01:45.199
Sun, sung.

01:46.817 --> 01:50.120
Ton, tongue.

01:51.921 --> 01:55.273
Done, dung.

01:56.425 --> 01:59.830
Thin, thing.

02:01.551 --> 02:07.844
Look out for the /n/ sound as you practice on EnglishCentral and good luck!
