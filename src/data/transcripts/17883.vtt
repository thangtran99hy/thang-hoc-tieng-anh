ï»¿Hi! This video is focused on the /p/ sound.

00:05.333 --> 00:07.986
/p/ is a voiceless consonant sound,...

00:08.320 --> 00:12.233
...and the /b/ sound is also made in the same place, but with voice.

00:13.080 --> 00:18.484
/p/ is a plosive and that means there's a lot of energy behind the sound.

00:19.094 --> 00:28.351
The /p/  sound is produced by bringing your lips tightly together and releasing a puff of air like this /p/.

00:29.481 --> 00:35.771
A common challenge involves adding an extra vowel sound after the /p/ sound.

00:36.084 --> 00:43.471
So for example the word "rip" becomes "rip uh" or "stop" becomes "stop uh".

00:44.387 --> 00:48.615
The key here is not to add the extra sound "uh" at the end,...

00:48.881 --> 00:51.830
...just let the voiceless /p/ end the word.

00:52.654 --> 00:58.988
Another challenge that could come up is replacing the /p/ sound with the /f/ sound.

00:59.382 --> 01:03.625
So a word like "cap" sounds like "calf".

01:04.347 --> 01:11.633
Here is one of my favorite tongue twisters for practicing both the /p/ and the /b/ sound.

01:12.191 --> 01:13.169
Here it goes.

01:14.623 --> 01:17.980
Paper poppy, baby bubble.

01:18.626 --> 01:21.680
Okay, you start slow and then you speed it up.

01:21.973 --> 01:23.307
So try it along with me.

01:24.425 --> 01:32.749
Paper poppy, baby bubble. Paper poppy, baby bubble. Paper poppy, baby bubble. Paper poppy, baby bubble. Paper poppy, baby bubble.

01:34.300 --> 01:36.751
Hopefully, your lips are warmed up now.

01:37.213 --> 01:39.261
And we can try a few words together.

01:40.761 --> 01:42.975
Pad, fad.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.175
Pig, fig.

01:47.197 --> 01:49.266
Pit, fit.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.537
Leaped, leafed.

01:53.461 --> 01:55.983
Sipped, sift.

01:56.874 --> 01:59.550
Lapping, laughing.

02:00.383 --> 02:02.657
Leap, leaf.

02:03.471 --> 02:06.066
Snip, sniff.

02:07.073 --> 02:09.345
Wipe, wife.

02:10.677 --> 02:15.178
Try this out as you practice on EnglishCentral and good luck!
