ï»¿Hi! This video focuses on the /v/ sound.

00:05.465 --> 00:14.503
/v/ is a voiced sound, which means you can feel some friction or vibration between your upper teeth and your lower lip.

00:15.289 --> 00:26.277
You make the /v/ sound by placing your top teeth against your lower lip like this, /v/, and you'll release your voice out of that shape.

00:26.770 --> 00:34.199
You should feel the sound vibrating between your upper teeth and your lower lip like this, /v/.

00:35.241 --> 00:42.337
The first common mistake in making the /v/ sound is to confuse it with the /w/ sound.

00:42.857 --> 00:47.698
The /w/ sound is more relaxed than the /v/ sound.

00:48.057 --> 00:49.986
And also, there are no teeth involved.

00:50.322 --> 00:52.769
Let's compare the two, take a look.

00:53.113 --> 00:57.827
/w/, /v/, /w/, /v/.

00:58.518 --> 01:00.775
And now, let's try some words.

01:01.709 --> 01:04.473
Vine, wine.

01:05.583 --> 01:08.301
Viper, wiper.

01:09.439 --> 01:12.175
Vent, went.

01:13.226 --> 01:16.384
Verse, worse.

01:17.774 --> 01:20.779
Vow, wow.

01:21.739 --> 01:24.771
Veered, weird.

01:25.981 --> 01:33.841
Another common mistake in making the /v/ sound is to confuse it with the /f/ sound.

01:34.352 --> 01:41.277
The /f/ sound is made in the same place as the /v/ sound but without voice.

01:41.728 --> 01:42.934
Let's compare the two.

01:43.665 --> 01:48.799
/f/, /v/, /f/, /v/.

01:49.571 --> 01:58.024
So why don't you practice along with me now, and we'll focus on feeling the lip vibrations that you need to make for the /v/ sound.

01:58.628 --> 02:01.937
We're going to compare /v/ with /f/.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.447
Let's try the sound at the beginning of words.

02:05.576 --> 02:08.183
Van, fan.

02:09.105 --> 02:11.547
Very, ferry.

02:12.723 --> 02:15.731
Vine, fine.

02:16.685 --> 02:22.096
And now, let's feel the difference between /v/ and /f/ in the middle of words.

02:23.085 --> 02:26.219
Invested, infested.

02:27.121 --> 02:29.693
Leaving, leafing.

02:31.108 --> 02:33.631
Waiver, wafer.

02:34.766 --> 02:38.017
And finally, here's the sound at the end of words.

02:39.020 --> 02:41.413
Save, safe.

02:43.019 --> 02:45.562
Live, life.

02:46.660 --> 02:49.365
Relieve, relief.

02:50.343 --> 02:55.298
