Hi! This video focuses on the /w/ sound.

00:05.105 --> 00:07.976
/w/ is a voiced consonant sound.

00:08.397 --> 00:16.649
And you make the /w/ by rounding your lips slightly and releasing voice like this, /w/.

00:17.648 --> 00:22.578
A challenge that can come up with the /w/ is mixing it up with the /v/.

00:23.171 --> 00:25.655
So "wine" sounds like "vine".

00:26.276 --> 00:32.379
It's helpful to remember that you will never feel your teeth against your lips for the /w/ sound.

00:33.401 --> 00:39.274
Let's try some sentences that compare the /w/ sound to the /v/ sound.

00:39.861 --> 00:42.868
Watch my lips and practice along with me.

00:44.338 --> 00:46.838
His verse is worse.

00:48.097 --> 00:50.808
We bought the vest out west.

00:51.995 --> 00:55.367
Walt put the wine in the vault.

00:56.745 --> 00:59.310
She went near the vent.

01:01.123 --> 01:04.883
Keep practicing on EnglishCentral and good luck!
