﻿Hi! This video is focused on the /j/ sound.

00:04.994 --> 00:08.039
/j/ is a voiced consonant sound.

00:08.691 --> 00:14.343
You make the /j/ sound by relaxing the tip of the tongue behind your lower front teeth,...

00:14.727 --> 00:22.319
...and feeling the sides of your tongue on your molars or side teeth like this: /j/, /j/.

00:23.413 --> 00:31.507
A common error with the /j/ sound is turning it into the /dʒ/ sound by bringing the blade of the tongue up.

00:31.929 --> 00:36.439
So, a word like "yolk" ends up sounding like "joke".

00:37.143 --> 00:43.761
Remember: for the /j/ sound, the front of the tongue is always relaxed down.
