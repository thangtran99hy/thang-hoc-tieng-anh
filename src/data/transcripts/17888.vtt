Longtime Google executive Marissa Mayer is trading one search company for another.

00:09.868 --> 00:14.189
On Tuesday, Mayer begins a new job as CEO at Yahoo.

00:14.593 --> 00:17.669
On Monday, she resigned from her VP post at Google.

00:17.889 --> 00:20.145
She was the company's first female hire.

00:20.303 --> 00:23.481
Right now is a great time to be a woman in tech, but there's not enough women in tech.

00:23.592 --> 00:28.625
During her 13-year tenure, Mayer oversaw many of Google's most successful products.

00:28.719 --> 00:31.671
She's credited with making the simplistic look of Google's home page...

00:31.783 --> 00:36.129
...with Gmail, with maps now, with location, with doing things in a very clean,...

00:36.227 --> 00:39.552
...elegant style, and that is something Yahoo certainly can use.

00:39.637 --> 00:44.608
Yahoo, a one-time tech darling, now ranks a distant third in market share for search.

00:45.122 --> 00:49.613
Mayer will be the sixth person to occupy the CEO office in the past five years.

00:50.064 --> 00:54.819
And though she is experienced, charismatic, well-spoken and has the technical chops,...

00:55.153 --> 00:58.415
...turning Yahoo around will require a Herculean effort.

00:58.623 --> 01:05.329
She's 37, she was number 20 employee at Google, I think she's worth quite a bit of money.

01:07.391 --> 01:09.247
What kind of better challenge could there be?

01:09.363 --> 01:13.430
To me, it seems like a huge opportunity. This could be a total career-defining moment for her.

01:13.512 --> 01:15.745
In a press release from Yahoo, Ms. Mayer said,...

01:15.897 --> 01:18.995
..."There is a lot to do and I can't wait to get started."

01:19.124 --> 01:21.509
The hiring news surprised many tech analysts...

01:21.612 --> 01:26.435
...who assumed Interim CEO Ross Levinsohn would be appointed to take the helm permanently.

01:26.963 --> 01:29.947
And Mayer's name never appeared on any shortlist.

01:30.047 --> 01:33.726
