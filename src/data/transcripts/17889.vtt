Hi, my name is Alex Taylor.

00:16.837 --> 00:20.729
And I'm Amy Mitano, and today we're in...

00:21.518 --> 00:22.404
...Spain.

00:23.609 --> 00:27.509
This is Madrid, my uncle and aunt live in Madrid.

00:27.723 --> 00:28.191
Really?

00:28.479 --> 00:28.961
Uh-huh.

00:29.796 --> 00:33.113
Madrid is a big city and it's really fun.

00:33.677 --> 00:36.008
Great food, great music.

00:36.367 --> 00:37.843
Amy, what's that?

00:38.129 --> 00:39.512
It's the royal palace.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.688
Wow! That's a big building.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.945
And this is Barcelona.

00:45.333 --> 00:48.005
Barcelona is my favorite city in Spain.

00:50.767 --> 00:52.455
It has a lot of great buildings.

00:56.635 --> 00:57.773
Hey, what's that?

00:58.299 --> 01:02.611
It's called "Sagrada Familia", it's my favorite building in Barcelona.

01:03.599 --> 01:04.617
Where are those people?

01:05.211 --> 01:06.042
In a restaurant.

01:06.693 --> 01:08.687
Oh, I love Spanish food.

01:11.457 --> 01:13.247
Now, we're in Andalucia.

01:24.647 --> 01:25.977
This is flamenco.

01:26.504 --> 01:29.518
Flamenco is music and it's dancing.

01:39.793 --> 01:41.301
Hey, is that a guitar?

01:42.063 --> 01:43.177
Uh-huh, it is.

01:43.333 --> 01:46.123
And that's my uncle, he makes guitars.

01:46.765 --> 01:47.352
Cool.

01:48.899 --> 01:50.883
And this is a flamenco singer.

02:00.302 --> 02:01.951
Now, we're in Granada.

02:02.821 --> 02:05.052
Wow! Those buildings are amazing.

02:09.812 --> 02:12.925
And this is Cordoba, it's in the south of Spain.

02:13.535 --> 02:14.883
Hmmm, it's beautiful.

02:17.443 --> 02:20.482
Well, those are some of my favorite places in Spain.

02:20.926 --> 02:22.628
Yeah, it's an amazing country.
