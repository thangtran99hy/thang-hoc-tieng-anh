Hi! This video is focused on the /g/ sound.

00:06.383 --> 00:09.059
/g/ is a voiced consonant sound.

00:09.298 --> 00:13.562
/g/ is a plosive sound, so there is a lot of energy behind it.

00:14.393 --> 00:20.023
The /g/ sound is produced by bouncing the back of your tongue off of the soft palate.

00:20.880 --> 00:29.315
I like to think of it like a trampoline action in the back of your tongue and the /g/ jumping to touch the soft palate and releasing.

00:29.828 --> 00:32.663
There are a couple of common challenges with this sound.

00:33.049 --> 00:38.277
One being the lack of muscularity, so you lose the energy of the /g/ sound.

00:38.668 --> 00:44.525
And another being a devoicing of the sound, so it sounds more like a /k/ rather than a /g/.

00:45.650 --> 00:50.006
This can lead to a mumbling quality or even a change in the meaning of the word.

00:50.313 --> 00:52.436
And it usually happens at the end of a word.

00:53.071 --> 00:56.587
Listen to the difference when I pronounce a few word pairs.

00:57.763 --> 01:00.367
Back, bag.

01:02.085 --> 01:04.728
Buck, bug.

01:06.232 --> 01:08.850
Dock, dog.

01:09.280 --> 01:13.392
Can you hear and feel the energy of both the /g/ and the /k/ sound?

01:14.064 --> 01:16.414
There was a big bounce happening back there.

01:17.297 --> 01:21.780
Also, as I mentioned before, the /g/ is a voiced sound...

01:22.118 --> 01:27.356
...so you need to make sure that you carry your voice through the articulation of the sound.

01:28.119 --> 01:29.867
So now, let's practice.

01:30.473 --> 01:35.605
Here is an exercise that can help you develop more energy and action in the back of your tongue.

01:36.027 --> 01:38.896
And this exercise will help with the /k/ sound, too.

01:39.484 --> 01:41.935
I call it, "Trampoline for the G".

01:42.661 --> 01:47.961
See when you try using your hands like I do to mirror what is happening in your mouth.

01:48.584 --> 01:52.699
The goal is to inhale and exhale on a /g/ sound.

01:52.951 --> 01:54.862
So, let's try this a few times together.

01:56.273 --> 02:05.453
/g/, /g/, /g/, /g/, /g/, /g/.

02:06.329 --> 02:10.555
You can actually do this exercise ten or 20 times.

02:10.769 --> 02:17.720
So, you can really get the action of /g/, /g/, /g/, /g/, /g/, /g/ as you practice.

02:18.109 --> 02:20.296
Now, let's try a few words together.

02:22.004 --> 02:22.619
Good.

02:24.123 --> 02:24.879
Got.

02:26.275 --> 02:26.939
Guy.

02:28.697 --> 02:30.004
Suggest.

02:31.079 --> 02:31.842
Yoga.

02:33.001 --> 02:33.783
Argue.

02:35.635 --> 02:36.309
Big.

02:37.071 --> 02:37.919
Fatigue.

02:39.229 --> 02:39.963
Dog.

02:41.987 --> 02:45.973
Try this out as you practice on EnglishCentral and good luck!
