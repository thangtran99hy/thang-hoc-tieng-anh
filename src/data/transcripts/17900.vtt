﻿Hi! This video covers the /h/ sound.

00:05.758 --> 00:09.268
As you might have guessed, /h/ is a voiceless sound.

00:09.698 --> 00:15.041
It is a fricative, which means, you may feel some friction or airflow on the back of your tongue.

00:16.231 --> 00:22.481
You make the /h/ sound by relaxing the back of your tongue and releasing air.

00:23.251 --> 00:30.808
You will feel the air between the back of your tongue and the soft palate. Like this, /h/.

00:31.473 --> 00:43.113
Some English learners will find that they make the /h/ sound a bit further back, so it sounds more like this, /h/ or this, /h/.

00:44.101 --> 00:49.523
In this case, you'll want to move the sound forward and relax the back of your throat a bit more.

00:49.946 --> 00:54.083
So think about sighing, like this.

00:54.622 --> 00:57.591
And then take away the vowel, /h/.

00:58.959 --> 01:05.276
Another challenge comes into play depending on the vowel sound that follows the /h/ .

01:06.007 --> 01:13.582
Sometimes, when it's followed by a /u/ or /ʊ/ sound, it can be a bit more challenging.

01:13.809 --> 01:21.105
And the reason for this is that the consonant /h/ is placed closely to these two back vowel sounds.

01:21.979 --> 01:31.468
So let's try practicing the /h/ sound in relation to the /u/ sound and the /ʊ/ sound.

01:32.266 --> 01:40.291
Your challenge is to gently release your breath on the /h/ and then add the voice of the vowel sound.

01:40.595 --> 01:41.802
So try this with me.

01:42.864 --> 01:46.365
/h/, /u/, who.

01:48.079 --> 01:51.810
/h/, /u/, whose.

01:53.371 --> 01:57.134
/h/, /u/, hoot.

01:58.379 --> 02:01.509
/h/, /u/, hoop.

02:02.859 --> 02:05.857
/h/, /ʊ/, hook.

02:06.909 --> 02:09.927
/h/, /ʊ/, hooked.

02:11.133 --> 02:14.201
Can you feel the /h/ before the vowel?

02:15.007 --> 02:22.115
Now, for an extra challenge, let's try the /h/ before the yu sound.

02:22.757 --> 02:24.759
First, let's try the combination together.

02:25.695 --> 02:34.213
/h/, yu, hu, /h/, yu, hu, /h/, yu, hu, /h/, yu, hu.

02:34.647 --> 02:36.802
And now let's try a few words.

02:38.024 --> 02:39.207
Human.

02:40.670 --> 02:42.021
Huge.

02:43.351 --> 02:44.615
Humane.

02:46.122 --> 02:47.415
Humility.

02:48.889 --> 02:49.743
Humor.

02:51.461 --> 02:55.366
Keep up your practice on EnglishCentral and good luck!
