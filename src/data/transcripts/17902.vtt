﻿Hi! This video focuses on the /ŋ/ sound.

00:06.335 --> 00:12.261
/ŋ/ is a voiced nasal consonant sound and that means the sound comes out the nose.

00:13.108 --> 00:22.624
You make the /ŋ/ sound by releasing your jaw and bringing the back of your tongue onto the soft palate and creating a seal.

00:23.539 --> 00:24.409
/ŋ/.

00:25.063 --> 00:30.935
People sometimes confuse the /ŋ/ sound with the /n/ sound.

00:31.407 --> 00:42.070
So the word "sung" can sound like "sun"  or they can add a "g" into the middle, so a word like "singer" sounds like "sing-ger."

00:42.632 --> 00:54.231
To help you find the placement of the /ŋ/, raise the back of your tongue up to the place where you make the /k/ or the /g/ sound, like this.

00:55.567 --> 01:04.356
Keep the contact between the back of your tongue and the soft palate and send your voice over that. /ŋ/.

01:05.411 --> 01:14.941
Great! Now, let's try a few words where the /ŋ/ is in the middle of the word, but make sure not to add a /g/ sound in there.

01:16.373 --> 01:20.121
Bringing not bring-ging.

01:21.483 --> 01:25.553
Belonging not belong-ging.

01:26.821 --> 01:31.331
And swinging not swing-ging.

01:31.741 --> 01:38.903
Now, let's try comparing the /ŋ/ sound with the /n/ sound at the ends of words.

01:39.517 --> 01:45.948
Remember, that the back of the tongue must be like a ski slope and touching the soft palate.

01:46.276 --> 01:52.775
The front of the tongue is relaxed, like this /ŋ/. Here we go.

01:53.885 --> 01:57.037
King, kin.

01:58.415 --> 02:01.706
Wing, win.

02:03.168 --> 02:06.118
Rung, run.

02:07.408 --> 02:10.285
Ping, pin.

02:11.782 --> 02:16.109
Keep practicing on EnglishCentral and good luck!
