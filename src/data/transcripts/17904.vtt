﻿Hi! This segment is focused on the /ɔɪ/ sound.

00:06.519 --> 00:16.276
/ɔɪ/ is a diphthong sound, and remember a diphthong is two vowel sounds that blend together so they almost feel like one.

00:16.881 --> 00:21.212
Notice the movement in my tongue. /ɔɪ/, /ɔɪ/.

00:21.985 --> 00:29.365
The tip of the tongue is relaxed and touching behind the lower front teeth for all vowel and diphthong sounds.

00:30.899 --> 00:35.075
To make the /ɔɪ/ sound, you need to start by releasing your jaw.

00:35.813 --> 00:42.857
Release the back of your tongue and bring the lip corners slightly forward like this, /ɔ/.

00:43.446 --> 00:48.915
And then, move the front of the tongue up toward the gum ridge to the /ɪ/ position.

00:49.444 --> 00:56.583
The second part of the diphthong is always shorter than the first, but you must make both sounds.

00:57.460 --> 01:01.912
We'll start slowly and then we'll blend them to a normal pace.

01:02.823 --> 01:09.809
/ɔɪ/, /ɔɪ/, /ɔɪ/, /ɔɪ/, /ɔɪ/, /ɔɪ/, /ɔɪ/.

01:11.351 --> 01:18.182
A common challenge with the /ɔɪ/ sound is that the speaker will neglect the second part of the diphthong.

01:18.998 --> 01:22.686
This results in the /ɔɪ/ sounding like /oʊ/.

01:23.326 --> 01:29.042
So let's practice each of the two sounds in the diphthong, separately and then together.

01:29.567 --> 01:37.540
Drop your jaw and the back of your tongue and bring your lip corners forward /ɔ/, /ɔ/, /ɔ/.

01:38.163 --> 01:45.458
Now, let's try the /ɪ/ sound. Match your sound with mine /ɪ/, /ɪ/, /ɪ/.

01:46.086 --> 01:52.845
Now, let's put them together. /ɔɪ/, /ɔɪ/, /ɔɪ/, /ɔɪ/, /ɔɪ/.

01:53.900 --> 01:56.884
Now, let's compare /ɔɪ/  with /oʊ/.

01:57.474 --> 02:02.737
Feel the difference between the two sounds as we try them together.

02:04.127 --> 02:07.068
She sold the soiled clothes.

02:08.106 --> 02:10.661
Most cookies are moist.

02:11.563 --> 02:14.546
That cold snake coiled up.

02:15.928 --> 02:19.665
Keep practicing on EnglishCentral and good luck!
