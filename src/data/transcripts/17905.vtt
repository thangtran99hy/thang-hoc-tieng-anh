﻿Hi! This video focuses on the /ʊ/ sound.

00:05.893 --> 00:10.581
/ʊ/ is a back vowel sound made with the lips slightly rounded.

00:11.044 --> 00:17.037
The tip of the tongue is relaxed and touching behind the lower front teeth for all vowel sounds.

00:18.209 --> 00:24.135
To make the /ʊ/ sound, the back of the tongue needs to be a bit higher than the front of the tongue...

00:24.495 --> 00:31.045
...and the lip corners are slightly forward like this: /ʊ/, /ʊ/.

00:32.599 --> 00:40.543
A common challenge with the /ʊ/ sound is that the speaker will overround the lips and bring the tongue up too high.

00:40.975 --> 00:43.786
This creates the /u/ sound.

00:44.159 --> 00:48.980
So a word like "could" ends up sounding like "cooed."

00:49.975 --> 00:55.726
A great way to practice the /ʊ/ sound is in relation to the /u/ sound.

00:56.537 --> 01:02.498
So use your hands to mirror what the tongue is doing and try this along with me.
