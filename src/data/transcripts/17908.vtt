﻿Hi! This video is focusing on the /ʒ/ sound.

00:07.313 --> 00:16.533
/ʒ/ is a voiced consonant sound and you'll feel friction as your voice buzzes between the blade of your tongue and your gum ridge.

00:17.595 --> 00:27.461
You make the /ʒ/ sound by directing the blade of your tongue toward the gum ridge without touching it like this, /ʒ/.

00:27.998 --> 00:31.782
The sides of the tongue should be touching the sides of your upper teeth.

00:33.345 --> 00:36.908
Here are two common mistakes with the /ʒ/ sound.

00:37.503 --> 00:44.666
The first is devoicing, so you turn the /ʒ/ sound into a /ʃ/ sound.

00:45.017 --> 00:49.751
And the result is a word like "garage" sounds like "garach".

00:50.915 --> 01:00.805
The second challenge is turning the /ʒ/ sound into a /s/ sound, so a word like "treasure" sounds like "treassure".

01:01.857 --> 01:06.345
Let's work together to find the correct placement of the /ʒ/ sound.

01:06.709 --> 01:12.835
We'll do that by pressing the blade of the tongue on the gum ridge to make the /n/ sound...

01:13.214 --> 01:18.630
...and then releasing to feel the buzzing flow of air for the /ʒ/ sound.

01:18.900 --> 01:20.780
Okay, try along with me.

01:21.639 --> 01:28.475
/n/, /ʒ/, /n/, /ʒ/, /n/, /ʒ/.

01:29.054 --> 01:34.323
Now, let's add the /j/ sound, so you could feel the sides of your tongue on your upper teeth.

01:34.777 --> 01:38.895
And you can do it with your hands as well, mirroring what's going on in your mouth.

01:39.703 --> 01:46.003
/j/. Feel the sides of your tongue and hold them there, and now move the blade up for /ʒ/.

01:46.210 --> 01:55.171
Let's do that together. /j/, /ʒ/, /j/, /ʒ/, /j/, /ʒ/.

01:55.897 --> 02:00.734
Good. Now that you have the placement, let's try some phrases.

02:02.163 --> 02:03.857
Beige garage.

02:05.225 --> 02:07.157
Casual massage.

02:08.197 --> 02:10.174
Envision pleasure.

02:11.138 --> 02:13.644
Unusual camouflage.

02:14.599 --> 02:18.969
Be sure to put this into practice on EnglishCentral and good luck!
