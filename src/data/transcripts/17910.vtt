00:00.869 --> 00:03.103
You're so far away.

00:03.314 --> 00:05.295
You're so far away.

00:06.048 --> 00:08.391
Ain't got too much pride.

00:08.909 --> 00:11.015
Want you back by my side.

00:11.851 --> 00:14.103
Well baby I want that, too.

00:14.209 --> 00:17.157
Baby I would run, run to you.

00:18.145 --> 00:19.433
I would run to you.

00:20.196 --> 00:21.854
And, I would run to you.

00:27.498 --> 00:29.666
The first time you talked to me.

00:29.853 --> 00:31.942
I knew we were meant to be.

00:32.724 --> 00:35.020
When we finally embraced.

00:35.201 --> 00:37.605
Baby, I can't keep this pace.

00:37.951 --> 00:40.182
I love you, there I said it.

00:40.322 --> 00:42.805
I think I'm gonna need a medic.

00:43.055 --> 00:45.398
You filled the hall with flower petals.

00:45.497 --> 00:48.033
Why does my mouth taste like metal?

00:48.343 --> 00:50.684
Baby, I might die without you.

00:50.805 --> 00:52.631
Baby, I might die.

00:54.649 --> 00:56.083
I would run to you.

00:56.667 --> 00:59.164
I'm not as strong as you.

00:59.463 --> 01:00.729
I would run to you.

01:00.838 --> 01:04.192
I... to you.

01:14.464 --> 01:16.645
Love is a speeding comet.

01:17.059 --> 01:19.221
I'm in a pool of my own vomit.

01:19.635 --> 01:21.949
Love is a perfect vision.

01:22.099 --> 01:24.624
This is such a bad decision.

01:24.975 --> 01:27.089
Love makes everything serene.

01:27.229 --> 01:29.697
Give me all your morphine.

01:32.780 --> 01:35.921
Baby, I know we said we'd run across the country to be together,...

01:36.002 --> 01:37.637
...but I thought we were being symbolic.

01:37.900 --> 01:39.984
Why can't we fly and meet somewhere in the middle?

01:40.510 --> 01:41.317
Like Kansas City? 

01:41.889 --> 01:43.401
It's the Paris of the Plains.

02:04.997 --> 02:09.209
Baby, I love you so much that I would run to you.

02:09.575 --> 02:10.799
You would run to me?

02:12.223 --> 02:13.751
You would run to me!

02:15.387 --> 02:19.527
Baby, I love you so much that I would run to you.

02:20.309 --> 02:21.586
I would run to you.
