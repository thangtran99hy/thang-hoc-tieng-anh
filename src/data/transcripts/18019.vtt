In less than 20 days, Wimbledon will host the Olympic tennis tournament.

00:06.513 --> 00:10.047
You would be 34 in Rio.

00:10.404 --> 00:16.933
So is this the last time that you think you can realistically win an Olympic singles?

00:17.923 --> 00:22.765
Yeah, this is gonna be my best chance I would think, particularly now winning Wimbledon just before.

00:23.067 --> 00:26.244
Even though I was world number one in Athens and also in Beijing.

00:26.637 --> 00:30.650
So I had a lot of heartbreak there as well, not coming through.

00:30.973 --> 00:35.900
But I did get Olympic gold in doubles in Beijing, which was an amazing dream come true for me...

00:36.000 --> 00:40.629
...and actually takes some pressure off this Olympics coming up now here at Wimbledon.

00:40.900 --> 00:43.566
And actually as we speak, banners are going up behind us, you know.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.950
And the Olympic spirit is already kicking in here.

00:46.200 --> 00:50.805
So I'm very excited to be coming back. And I mean, Rio, who knows what's gonna happen?

00:51.571 --> 00:54.738
Health will decide, family, there's so many moving parts here.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.370
But this is obviously a big occasion and a big moment for tennis.
