This Olympics means the most to me because I think I'm taking it most serious.

00:03.530 --> 00:06.412
Not that I didn't take Beijing serious but, I did.

00:06.913 --> 00:13.191
But this time I'm a little older and I understand more just the importance of the Olympics.

00:13.748 --> 00:14.809
It takes guts.

00:15.327 --> 00:16.625
It takes hard work.

00:17.031 --> 00:20.367
And it takes a lot of determination to do really well at the Olympics.

00:20.845 --> 00:22.681
Standing on the podium is amazing.

00:22.766 --> 00:26.323
And winning the gold medal, it's really no better feeling.

00:27.142 --> 00:31.256
The first thing I'm gonna do if I win a medal is go to McDonald's and have a fish fillet.

00:32.127 --> 00:34.204
I am Serena Williams, I am a tennis player...

00:34.285 --> 00:38.347
...and I'm really excited to represent the United States of America at the Olympics.
