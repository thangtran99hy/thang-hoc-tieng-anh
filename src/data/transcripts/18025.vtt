Hi, I'm Maria Sharapova and I'm a professional tennis player.

00:03.523 --> 00:07.851
And I can't wait to represent my country of Russia at the Summer Olympic Games.

00:09.912 --> 00:12.521
What makes Summer Olympic Games special, personally for me,...

00:12.597 --> 00:16.669
...is that I don't think there's anything like being part of the whole Olympics experience...

00:16.743 --> 00:19.243
...where you're there simply to represent your country.

00:20.019 --> 00:22.917
It meant a lot for me just to participate and even more to win a medal.

00:24.086 --> 00:28.218
I think I'm mostly just looking forward to being part of all these different sports...

00:28.317 --> 00:30.381
...and the parade and the opening ceremony.

00:30.500 --> 00:35.031
And although we always travel and represent our countries in so many different sports,...

00:35.099 --> 00:38.959
...to be in one place all of us together, I think that would be the most memorable experience.
