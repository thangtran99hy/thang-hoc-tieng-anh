Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen has continued her startling rise to glory by taking her second gold at London 2012...

00:08.492 --> 00:10.476
...in the 200 meters individual medley.

00:10.939 --> 00:16.379
And like any superstar, Ye is attracting quite a following amongst swimmers in her home nation.

00:19.360 --> 00:20.188
I like swimming.

00:20.573 --> 00:25.193
I want to be like big brother Sun Yang and big sister Ye Shiwen and do the Olympics.

00:25.585 --> 00:26.797
I'm very jealous of them.

00:27.983 --> 00:33.263
Some fans however are upset at the controversy surrounding the superpower's new super swimmer.

00:36.067 --> 00:42.276
We feel very angry that a small number of people in the West would say this about young Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen.

00:42.682 --> 00:44.134
They're being so irresponsible.

00:44.273 --> 00:49.483
Our young girl relied on her perseverance and talents to gain glory for the country and to win the race.

00:49.749 --> 00:52.771
We're very angry over what certain people in the West said.

00:53.639 --> 00:59.013
Either way, the goals, aspirations, and performances of one young girl thousand of miles from home...

00:59.483 --> 01:01.451
...are set to inspire a generation.
