00:17.245 --> 00:17.653
See.

00:17.923 --> 00:19.168
Reality is gross.

00:19.381 --> 00:21.206
It so is.

00:23.323 --> 00:26.769
Hey, have you ever heard of the fourth wall?

00:26.935 --> 00:27.337
No.

00:27.855 --> 00:29.346
Oh, I have.

00:29.695 --> 00:31.626
Don't just google it!

00:31.875 --> 00:33.831
Oh, never mind.

00:34.499 --> 00:40.573
Anyways, the fourth wall is this imaginary wall that the audience sees through.

00:40.800 --> 00:41.017
What?

00:41.170 --> 00:42.537
Like on a sitcom?

00:42.759 --> 00:42.983
Yeah.

00:43.178 --> 00:43.719
Exactly.

00:44.208 --> 00:46.394
That's the world I want to live in.

00:46.770 --> 00:48.974
That's where real happiness is.

00:49.104 --> 00:50.101
Totally.

00:50.723 --> 00:50.900
Wait.

00:51.469 --> 00:52.071
What do you mean?

00:52.844 --> 00:53.393
Think about it.

00:53.742 --> 00:56.031
When you have an audience, everything's better.

00:56.210 --> 00:56.663
Right?

00:56.992 --> 01:02.547
Like everything that's dumb and boring, and ugly becomes like cool and part of your story.

01:03.028 --> 01:07.494
Like this stinky bus, it would be way better if it was on TV.

01:07.811 --> 01:08.401
Right?

01:09.076 --> 01:10.489
You're totally right, Letty.

01:10.869 --> 01:15.109
All these people would be like way better versions of themselves.

01:15.320 --> 01:15.778
Exactly.

01:16.085 --> 01:18.393
They'd be like the same, but way cooler.

01:21.607 --> 01:21.875
Yeah.

01:22.210 --> 01:24.241
And they have like real products that we actually want.

01:24.457 --> 01:24.708
Right?

01:24.933 --> 01:25.539
Totally.

01:25.707 --> 01:29.955
The reason TV is so much better for us is 'cause it's packed with everything we want.

01:30.237 --> 01:31.533
You're totally right, Letty.

01:31.753 --> 01:34.323
Life would be like way better if it were TV.

01:34.467 --> 01:34.942
I know.

01:35.465 --> 01:37.036
Reality is bad for us.
