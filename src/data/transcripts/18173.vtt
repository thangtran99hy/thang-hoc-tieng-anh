Hello and welcome to this special edition of SciShow news.

00:04.029 --> 00:07.805
Neil Armstrong died this morning of complications after a medical procedure.

00:08.773 --> 00:12.938
He was not the only man to walk on another world, 12 other men have done that.

00:13.693 --> 00:18.455
But this isn't about whose footprints are where, this is about what a world accomplished.

00:19.533 --> 00:25.886
Neil Armstrong started his career as a navy pilot. But unlike many of his pilot colleagues, he then went on to get an engineering degree.

00:26.457 --> 00:31.970
This knowledge would be extremely useful as Armstrong started his career as a test pilot for a top secret aircraft.

00:33.092 --> 00:40.524
Through this training and his love of science and math and exploration, his path took him to NASA and eventually to the moon.

00:41.818 --> 00:45.127
Armstrong, over a cast of thousands of potential candidates...

00:45.196 --> 00:49.811
...was selected to be the first man on the moon because people knew that he would become a symbol.

00:50.079 --> 00:52.278
And they wanted a man who had been many things...

00:52.638 --> 00:58.667
...and yet remained even-tempered, levelheaded, and with a substantially smaller ego than many of his colleagues.

00:59.151 --> 01:05.571
Armstrong, they knew, would understand that this wasn't something he had done but instead something we had done.

01:06.298 --> 01:10.000
After returning to Earth, Armstrong took a position teaching engineering.

01:10.439 --> 01:17.004
He declined all offers of public office and kept his political views private and refused to profit unduly from his position.

01:17.765 --> 01:23.325
He became his mission, he captured that spirit, he took it to heart, he was the world's accomplishment.

01:23.487 --> 01:28.840
A face and a name to put to one of the most marvelous things humanity has ever accomplished.

01:29.247 --> 01:36.810
Neil Armstrong was an engineer, a pilot, a soldier, a leader, a captain, a nerd, but most of all he was all of us.

01:37.194 --> 01:41.313
He was a symbol of what we can do when we work together toward a common goal.

01:41.922 --> 01:47.286
He was a symbol of the power of America, of science, of engineering and of the unity of mankind.

01:47.922 --> 01:52.029
We will never lose that symbol, but we are all sad to have lost the man.
