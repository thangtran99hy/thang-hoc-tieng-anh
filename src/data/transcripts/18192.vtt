00:02.159 --> 00:02.847
What's up everybody?

00:02.925 --> 00:04.449
Daemon Hatfield here with IGN News.

00:04.706 --> 00:07.276
In the highly publicized Apple versus Samsung case,...

00:07.505 --> 00:10.005
... the jury has ruled largely in favor of Apple,...

00:10.341 --> 00:13.413
...finding Samsung guilty of willfully infringing Apple patents.

00:13.796 --> 00:16.711
The jury arrived at the decision after a very short deliberation.

00:17.165 --> 00:19.971
More than a few wild developments surfaced during the case,...

00:20.146 --> 00:22.805
including a 130-page document that Samsung used...

00:22.896 --> 00:24.452
...to compare their phones to the iPhone...

00:24.768 --> 00:27.497
...and a judge asking an Apple attorney if he was on crack.

00:27.995 --> 00:31.019
The court claims that Samsung slavishly copied the iPhone.

00:31.748 --> 00:34.618
The jury has ruled that many Samsung devices from the S2...

00:34.695 --> 00:37.493
...to the Infuse 4G were infringing on Apple's patents,...

00:37.769 --> 00:40.952
...patents which Apple argued added perceived value to its phones.

00:41.577 --> 00:44.245
Samsung will owe Apple more than one billion in damages.

00:44.337 --> 00:46.549
You heard that right: one billion dollars.

00:46.771 --> 00:48.153
An appeal is all but inevitable.

00:48.527 --> 00:51.193
On September 20th, there will be a ruling on injunctions...

00:51.354 --> 00:53.635
which will determine if and which Samsung phones...

00:53.830 --> 00:55.082
...will need to be pulled from the market.

00:55.619 --> 00:58.786
This isn't the first time that Samsung has been found infringing on patents.

00:59.145 --> 01:01.234
In 2009, in the major case versus Sharp,...

01:01.612 --> 01:03.579
...Samsung was banned from selling and advertising...

01:03.649 --> 01:05.845
...a wide variety of its LCD devices.

01:06.257 --> 01:09.511
No word yet on whether or not that Apple attorney was actually on crack.

01:09.868 --> 01:12.781
As soon as I have confirmation either way, I'll let you know right here at IGN.
