00:01.143 --> 00:05.701
Following the verdict by a California jury, financial markets deliver their own,...

00:05.953 --> 00:08.849
...sending Samsung shares down as much as eight percent...

00:09.135 --> 00:11.713
...and pushing Apple stock prices to a new high.

00:12.158 --> 00:15.822
But even bigger than the billion-dollar penalty is the message it sends.

00:16.170 --> 00:18.949
Sascha Segan is lead analyst for PC Magazine.

00:19.079 --> 00:23.590
Well, all the other phone manufacturers are now scared that Apple is going to sue them...

00:23.900 --> 00:28.306
...based on these newly validated and quite powerful patents,...

00:28.631 --> 00:31.730
...especially that design patent for the front face of the iPhone.

00:31.837 --> 00:33.200
A lot of phones look like that.

00:33.683 --> 00:38.693
Apple has submitted a list of eight Samsung devices it wants banned for patent infringement,...

00:38.985 --> 00:42.175
...a move analysts say could cause Samsung billions more.

00:42.589 --> 00:47.560
But MacWorld editor Armando Rodriguez says Samsung is not the only company affected.

00:47.640 --> 00:53.145
It's also a smack to Google and Android too because that's what they're competing against.

00:53.659 --> 00:57.801
In a written statement, Samsung called the verdict, "a loss for the American consumer."

00:58.180 --> 01:00.249
Law professor Robin Feldman agrees.

01:00.595 --> 01:06.069
She says the verdict will lead to less innovation, fewer choices and higher prices for consumers.

01:06.379 --> 01:09.820
When companies spend this kind of money on global battles,...

01:10.044 --> 01:14.535
...they have less to spend on innovation and it's always the consumer who loses when that happens.

01:15.297 --> 01:18.589
Apple, now the world's biggest company, is currently embroiled...

01:18.685 --> 01:21.830
...in a number of patent infringement cases against various companies,...

01:22.057 --> 01:23.545
...from Google to Microsoft.

01:23.891 --> 01:26.232
And the legal arguments could go on for years.

01:26.545 --> 01:30.019
At stake, says Feldman, is domination of the smartphone industry,...

01:30.321 --> 01:34.139
...now worth more than 200 billion dollars a year and still growing.
