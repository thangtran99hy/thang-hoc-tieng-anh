00:01.543 --> 00:04.623
Well, it's an unsettled picture as we head towards the end of the week.

00:05.729 --> 00:09.487
This afternoon it'll be cold, wet and windy across most of Scotland.

00:10.201 --> 00:13.153
We're under the influence of low pressure...

00:13.377 --> 00:18.554
...and this weather front pushing northwest is bringing cloud and outbreaks of rain.

00:19.109 --> 00:23.398
The rain, of course, will be heaviest over the borders and around Edinburgh,...

00:23.804 --> 00:26.310
...where it could lead to difficult conditions on the roads.

00:27.313 --> 00:29.894
In the west, rain will be lighter and patchier.

00:29.971 --> 00:33.871
There would, maybe a few drier interludes over Dumfries House in Ayrshire.

00:35.311 --> 00:39.473
There will be snow for the higher ground of the highlands and Aberdeenshire.

00:40.053 --> 00:42.067
The potential for a few flurries over Balmoral...

00:42.314 --> 00:43.219
Who the hell wrote this script?

00:43.960 --> 00:45.375
...as the afternoon goes on.

00:46.115 --> 00:52.379
The best of the drier and brighter weather will, of course, be over the northern isles and the far north of the mainland.

00:52.485 --> 00:56.211
So, a little hazy sunshine for the Castle of Mey and Caithness,...

00:56.769 --> 01:01.649
...but a cold day everywhere with temperatures of just eight Celsius and a brisk, northeasterly wind.

01:02.081 --> 01:03.507
Thank God it isn't a bank holiday!
