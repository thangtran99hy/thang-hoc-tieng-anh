Some people will tell you that a great relationship is based on the attraction of opposites.

00:04.910 --> 00:10.411
Others say you have to have taste, interest and personality types in common or your marriage will fail.

00:10.928 --> 00:11.919
So which one is true?

00:12.063 --> 00:13.760
Well, neither guarantees success.

00:14.388 --> 00:18.059
What does matter is that you and your partner share identical core values.

00:18.479 --> 00:20.479
Yes, I said identical.

00:20.671 --> 00:22.232
Not similar, identical.

00:22.821 --> 00:27.701
The closer you match your partner's values, the better your chances of making it in your marriage.

00:28.154 --> 00:32.527
Values are the principles that guide our actions, particularly in relation to others.

00:33.225 --> 00:36.022
They express how we think people should behave.

00:36.554 --> 00:39.809
When we act out of value, we're doing our part to make the world...

00:39.999 --> 00:42.901
...the way we think it should be, not just the way it is.

00:43.453 --> 00:46.435
Values inspire us to attempt that very lofty goal.

00:46.906 --> 00:50.063
Another thing about values, they're not situation specific.

00:50.643 --> 00:53.771
No matter what the circumstance is, values hold.

00:54.239 --> 00:56.854
Goals can change, desires can adjust.

00:57.367 --> 01:00.951
But our sense of what is right on a gut level cannot be altered.

01:01.229 --> 01:06.521
So discover your values and your partner's values and start finding common ground.
