So a noun is a person, place or thing.

00:05.738 --> 00:07.859
A verb is an action word...

00:08.757 --> 00:09.318
Max?

00:10.361 --> 00:11.654
Something to share with the class?

00:12.539 --> 00:13.087
Come on.

00:19.575 --> 00:20.251
Thank you.

00:24.965 --> 00:29.555
How tired I am of this unbearable distance between us.

00:30.163 --> 00:32.785
How I long for the toll of the recess bell.

00:33.933 --> 00:35.104
Have you forgotten me?

00:36.071 --> 00:37.301
Grown mindless of me?

00:38.655 --> 00:44.688
Tell me I am not writing into an abyss or that is what will become of my heart.
