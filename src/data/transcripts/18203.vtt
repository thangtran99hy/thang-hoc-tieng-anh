Bacon's not hard to cook but we found a way to make sure it's cooked well every time.

00:08.771 --> 00:12.193
Here's a simple technique for making it crisp and tender instead of dry and crumbly.

00:12.993 --> 00:16.001
Place the bacon in just enough water and cover it in a skillet over high heat.

00:16.595 --> 00:21.468
The additional water keeps the initial cooking temperature low and gentle so the meat retains its moisture and stays tender.

00:22.156 --> 00:24.215
When the water reaches to a boil, lower the heat to medium.

00:24.831 --> 00:30.576
Once all the water simmered away, turn the heat down to medium low and continue cooking until the bacon is crisp and well brown.

00:31.297 --> 00:35.749
By the time the water reaches its boiling point at 212 degrees, the bacon fat is almost completely rendered,...

00:36.247 --> 00:39.387
...so you're also much less likely to burn the meat while waiting for the fat to cook off.

00:40.376 --> 00:44.569
And what you're left with is plump bacon that's pleasantly crisp and not tough or brittle.
