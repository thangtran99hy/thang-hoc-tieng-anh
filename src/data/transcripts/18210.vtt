I think the truly innovative ideas come from two places:...

00:03.379 --> 00:06.017
...number one, culture; and number two, a process.

00:06.355 --> 00:07.244
So, let's look at those.

00:07.673 --> 00:11.859
By culture, I really mean the environment in which we innovate, both internally and externally.

00:12.368 --> 00:14.179
How safe do we feel to create?

00:14.241 --> 00:16.205
How safe do we feel to be our best selves?

00:16.896 --> 00:21.031
We found that the culture and the environment in which we innovate have a direct correlation...

00:21.274 --> 00:24.114
...to the amount and quality of the ideas that a group can produce.

00:24.335 --> 00:25.617
Second, our process.

00:26.188 --> 00:28.713
Although creating a team full of talent obviously is important,...

00:29.025 --> 00:34.349
...the truly innovative, executable ideas that we produce are often more a result of our process...

00:34.695 --> 00:36.381
...than the individuals who produce those ideas.

00:36.889 --> 00:39.899
Our funnel process takes raw ideas that we come up with...

00:40.125 --> 00:44.559
...and funnels them down using reaction and integration to create new and hybrid ideas...

00:44.881 --> 00:48.370
...that have a level of innovation that's way more than the sum of their parts.

00:49.044 --> 00:54.847
We found that's it's rare for an individual or group to consistently be able to produce innovative ideas on command.

00:55.213 --> 00:59.598
So, we work hard at creating a culture that allows people to feel motivated and safe,...

00:59.836 --> 01:05.299
...and a process that takes volumes of ideas through several steps and leads to true innovation.
