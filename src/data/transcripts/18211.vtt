One of the core beliefs that we have as improvisors is that all of us were created innovatively perfect and equal.

00:06.805 --> 00:11.703
We believe that over the course of a lifetime, because of things like parenting, socialization and perhaps education,...

00:12.214 --> 00:15.555
...that we all stray in different degrees from our most innovative self.

00:16.205 --> 00:17.588
We believe this because of kids.

00:17.890 --> 00:20.250
It's so easy to observe how creative children are.

00:20.727 --> 00:24.970
For the most part, all five-year-olds can improvise, innovate and pretend...

00:25.409 --> 00:26.884
...at about the same level of perfection.

00:27.579 --> 00:29.991
So the process we use to help people to become more innovative...

00:30.332 --> 00:34.703
...is to simply help them unlearn some of the things that have become innovative inhibitors...

00:35.471 --> 00:39.852
...and help them gently retrace their steps back to their most innovative self.

00:40.511 --> 00:44.613
We think that the path to innovation is a long, patient, inward journey.

00:45.083 --> 00:47.431
But we also think there's some things that can help you get there faster.

00:48.015 --> 00:52.411
Some of them are broad like learning how to accept new ideas and learning how to defer judgment.

00:52.947 --> 00:54.780
And others are just ridiculously simple.

00:55.264 --> 01:00.229
Like increasing the amount of times you use the conjunction "Yes, and" instead of "No, but".

01:00.971 --> 01:04.815
Like any good athlete, improvisors consistently practice the skills and behaviors...

01:05.132 --> 01:09.319
...that are needed to increase their ability to come up with more and better ideas.
