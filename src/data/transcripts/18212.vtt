I believe that the best way to increase your ability to come up with more and better ideas...

00:04.295 --> 00:06.559
...is to simply practice, practice, practice.

00:07.044 --> 00:10.101
If we compare the world of business to the worlds of athletics and the arts,...

00:10.403 --> 00:11.965
...one glaring difference shines through.

00:12.292 --> 00:16.285
In athletics and in most artistic endeavors, we practice much more than we perform.

00:16.735 --> 00:19.852
As a college football player, I would practice for two months before the first game...

00:20.145 --> 00:22.362
...and then five times a week for one game on Saturday.

00:22.706 --> 00:27.119
As an actor and improvisor, I've learned that practicing and warming up before I perform...

00:27.475 --> 00:29.696
...is as important as my performance skills or talents.

00:30.081 --> 00:31.347
One of the simple things we can do...

00:31.411 --> 00:34.582
...to make sure that we take the time to practice our innovation skills...

00:34.875 --> 00:38.310
...is to create project models and schedules that have built-in components...

00:38.573 --> 00:41.355
...and time allotments for idea generation and refinement.

00:41.825 --> 00:44.896
Too often I see groups moving directly to the implementation stage...

00:44.970 --> 00:46.385
...or the action steps of the process.

00:46.491 --> 00:48.082
Practicing innovation can be easy.

00:48.453 --> 00:52.184
You can simply commit to a two-minute brainstorming session before each meeting.

00:52.699 --> 00:54.074
Warming up for innovation,...

00:54.328 --> 00:57.212
...it can be as utilitarian as asking everyone to turn off their cell phones...

00:57.287 --> 01:00.424
...and engaging in a non-work conversation before the meeting begins.

01:00.906 --> 01:02.109
You'll be surprised at what can happen.
