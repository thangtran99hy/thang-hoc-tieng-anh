For me, it's a cause of some upset that more anglophones don't enjoy language.

00:09.382 --> 00:14.365
Music is enjoyable it seems, so are dance and other athletic forms of movement.

00:14.938 --> 00:21.435
People seem to be able to find sensual and sensuous pleasure in almost anything but words these days.

00:21.767 --> 00:26.579
Words it seems, belong to other people, anyone who expresses themselves with originality,...

00:26.672 --> 00:32.686
...delight and verbal freshness is more likely to be mocked, distrusted or disliked than welcomed.

00:33.455 --> 00:38.273
The free and happy use of words appears to be considered elitist or pretentious.

00:38.628 --> 00:48.007
Sadly, desperately sadly, the only people who seem to bother with language in public today bother with it in quite the wrong way.

00:48.288 --> 00:54.271
They write letters to broadcasters and newspapers in which they are rude and haughty about other people's usage...

00:54.345 --> 00:59.139
...and in which they show off their own superior 'knowledge' of how language should be.

00:59.619 --> 01:05.855
I hate that, and I particularly hate the fact that so many of these pedants assume that I'm on their side.

01:06.506 --> 01:14.603
When asked to join in a "let's persuade this supermarket chain to get rid of their ' five items or less ' sign," I never join in.

01:14.738 --> 01:19.590
Yes, I am aware of the technical distinction between 'less' and 'fewer',...

01:19.865 --> 01:27.293
...and between 'uninterested' and 'disinterested' and 'infer' and 'imply', and all the rest of them but none of these are of importance to me.

01:27.418 --> 01:37.435
"None of these are of importance," I said there, you'll notice the old pedantic me would have insisted on "none of them is of importance".

01:41.118 --> 01:45.111
Well, I'm glad to say I've outgrown that silly approach to language.

01:45.524 --> 01:51.195
Oscar Wilde, and there have been few greater and more complete lords of language in the past thousand years,...

01:51.507 --> 01:58.026
...once included with a manuscript he was delivering to his publishers a compliment slip in which he had scribbled the injunction:...

01:58.571 --> 02:05.325
..."I'll leave you to tidy up the woulds and shoulds, wills and shalls, thats and whiches, etc."

02:05.895 --> 02:09.431
Which gives us all encouragement to feel less guilty, don't you think?
