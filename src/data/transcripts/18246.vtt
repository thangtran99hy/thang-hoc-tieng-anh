00:36.880 --> 00:40.397
There were a couple of days each year you were allowed to take your children to work.

00:40.778 --> 00:41.808
And Joe loved it.

00:41.993 --> 00:45.416
That was his birthday present, and he would spend the night in the firehouse.

00:46.146 --> 00:47.277
We'd have a cake.

00:47.517 --> 00:53.183
And the guys I worked with, they would take a milk container and they'd cut out the facsimile of a building.

00:53.821 --> 00:56.631
And they'd put it on the top of the cake and then they would light it up.

00:56.967 --> 01:00.259
And they would tell Joe to put it out and he would throw a pot of water on it.

01:00.709 --> 01:03.998
The birthday cake was a little soggy, but this was what he wanted.

01:04.791 --> 01:08.275
Joe started dating a young lady whose father was a police officer.

01:08.395 --> 01:11.923
And he came home one day and he said, "I'm taking the police test."

01:12.228 --> 01:14.257
I said, "Joe, you're only 17 years old."

01:14.457 --> 01:15.771
He said, "No big deal."

01:16.839 --> 01:21.473
On the other side of the room, my son John wanted to be the next Donald Trump.

01:21.768 --> 01:24.807
He was gonna make a million dollars and take care of his mother and father.

01:25.568 --> 01:28.889
But in 1984, I came down with throat cancer.

01:29.723 --> 01:33.075
He noticed then how my unit took care of us.

01:33.472 --> 01:35.355
And he said, "I'm gonna become a fireman."

01:35.629 --> 01:36.582
I said, "You're kidding me."

01:36.963 --> 01:38.710
Firemen don't make millions of dollars.

01:39.085 --> 01:40.638
How am I gonna live it like a king?

01:41.760 --> 01:43.818
But I was very happy, very proud.

01:44.415 --> 01:50.806
My father had been on the fire department and he was the first one to be issued badge number 3436.

01:51.295 --> 01:56.690
And they reissued it to my son John, so the badge is only used by two.

01:58.341 --> 02:01.348
Both the boys would call me when they were working.

02:02.257 --> 02:05.510
John would always call around 3:30, four o'clock.

02:05.945 --> 02:11.182
And that particular night, September 10th, we spoke for a few minutes.

02:11.562 --> 02:13.249
And I said, "I love you."

02:14.334 --> 02:16.050
And he said, "I love you."

02:17.709 --> 02:23.746
Joe called me in the morning and told me to turn on the television, that a plane just hit the Trade Center.

02:24.177 --> 02:26.840
And he said, "I'm heading south on West Street."

02:27.463 --> 02:28.203
"This is a big one."

02:28.767 --> 02:30.449
And I just said, "Be careful, I love you."

02:30.612 --> 02:31.377
He said, "I love you too."

02:32.074 --> 02:32.547
That was it.

02:34.055 --> 02:38.543
We had the boys for, John for 36 years, Joe for 34 years.

02:39.115 --> 02:42.111
Ironically, badge number 3436.

02:43.591 --> 02:46.591
I don't have any could've, should've or would'ves.

02:47.451 --> 02:48.711
I wouldn't have changed anything.

02:51.038 --> 02:56.353
It's not many people that the last words they said to their son or daughter was "I love you."

02:57.073 --> 02:59.696
And the last words that they heard was "I love you."

03:01.238 --> 03:03.922
So that makes me sleep at night.
