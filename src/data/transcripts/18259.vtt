00:04.583 --> 00:07.857
People have been curious about this for a while so you go back,...

00:07.958 --> 00:10.748
...and here's a beautiful example, to the 1920s.

00:10.968 --> 00:14.184
A young scientist by the name of Asa Schaeffer asked a friend,...

00:14.745 --> 00:16.133
 ..."Could you put on a blindfold?"

00:16.267 --> 00:17.913
"I'm going to take you to the edge of a field."

00:17.977 --> 00:22.811
And he said, "What I'd like you to do is walk across this field in a straight line."

00:22.906 --> 00:26.130
"Just stay as straight on course as you possibly can."

00:26.339 --> 00:31.721
So the man headed off and here is Asa's map of what happened next.

00:31.799 --> 00:34.930
The man starts to walk and his route as you see here...

00:35.063 --> 00:37.838
...begins to tilt ever so slightly to the right.

00:38.281 --> 00:39.612
I'm gonna speed this up just a bit.

00:39.725 --> 00:43.965
Notice that the blindfolded man now starts to turn dramatically,...

00:44.067 --> 00:46.681
...taking him back to the road where he started from,...

00:46.751 --> 00:52.245
...and then across the road and then around again and then back again and around again.

00:52.313 --> 00:58.333
And increasingly he's moving in smaller curls until finally he hits a tree and stops.

00:58.952 --> 01:02.784
All the while he thought he was walking in a perfectly straight line.

01:02.958 --> 01:03.447
Strange?

01:03.571 --> 01:06.275
Well, there are many studies just like this.

01:06.915 --> 01:11.913
From 1928, here are three people who leave a barn on a very foggy day...

01:12.008 --> 01:15.534
...and what they want to do is go to a point about a half mile away.

01:16.190 --> 01:19.037
Here's what happened, the map version.

01:19.187 --> 01:20.280
The barn is here.

01:21.367 --> 01:22.769
The destination is here.

01:23.456 --> 01:25.282
Now watch this, off they go.

01:25.833 --> 01:30.478
They think they're walking straight, but instead what they actually do is that they start to turn...

01:30.973 --> 01:38.605
...and turn and turn and end up, weirdly, back in the very place they started, the barn!

01:39.625 --> 01:42.317
This experiment has been done in all kinds of situations.

01:42.374 --> 01:44.027
Here's another 1928 study.

01:44.485 --> 01:47.737
A man is blindfolded and then asked to jump into a lake...

01:48.668 --> 01:51.479
...and swim in a straight line to the other side.

01:51.559 --> 01:54.547
And here is where he swam.

01:55.152 --> 02:01.191
There is apparently a profound inability in humans to stick to a straight line when blindfolded...

02:01.949 --> 02:07.893
...or when there is no fixed point, no sun, no moon, no mountaintop, to guide them.

02:08.455 --> 02:12.310
In this last case, a blindfolded man is asked to get into a car...

02:13.111 --> 02:19.340
...and is told to drive in a straight line across a totally empty Kansas field.

02:19.488 --> 02:23.427
Now the driver is not in any danger, all he has to do is hold course.

02:23.539 --> 02:26.044
But here is the map that shows what happened next.

02:27.135 --> 02:31.033
For 80 years, scientists have been trying to explain this tendency...

02:31.147 --> 02:33.394
...to turn when you think you're going straight.

02:33.942 --> 02:38.576
They thought maybe this is some form of handedness, like being a righty or a lefty.

02:38.631 --> 02:40.581
Or maybe it's a right-left brain thing,...

02:40.646 --> 02:45.487
...where one side of you is slightly dominant and then the dominance builds over time.

02:45.938 --> 02:48.191
Maybe it's just simple asymmetry.

02:48.255 --> 02:52.702
Some people are stronger on one side or have different-sized arms or legs...

02:52.823 --> 02:56.904
But try as they might, and we're still trying these experiments,...

02:57.193 --> 03:01.626
...nobody has really figured out why we can't go straight.
