WEBVTT

00:05.323 --> 00:13.400
We do not work isolated or in an individual way in order to make an exchange happen.

00:14.842 --> 00:22.979
In general, we are groups, or we have groups of volunteers working together in a community.

00:23.883 --> 00:32.665
Through those volunteers, we reach out to schools, we reach out to participants, and we reach out to families.

00:33.421 --> 00:40.309
So all of them, at some point, work together and relate to each other.

00:41.166 --> 00:51.541
We are more of a social movement, rather than just isolated people doing isolated things.

00:51.977 --> 00:57.365
And this structure doesn't only happen in our way of working, it doesn't only happen here in the US.

00:57.814 --> 01:08.596
It also happens in all of the countries where we operate, and where we have been operating during the past 60 years or more.

01:09.161 --> 01:14.514
So, that is what makes AFS very unique and very special.

01:15.269 --> 01:22.814
On behalf of the board of directors of AFS-USA, our national council, and staff of the organization,...

01:23.415 --> 01:28.159
...I want to thank all and each of you during this National Volunteer Week.
