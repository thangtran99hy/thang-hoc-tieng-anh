The Think Results Communications presents:...

00:13.210 --> 00:17.471
...Blended Learning or How to Always Stay Two Steps Ahead.

00:19.075 --> 00:23.449
This is Mark, the human resource manager of a big international bank.

00:24.949 --> 00:28.733
He has recently been assigned to lead a project orientated around...

00:28.845 --> 00:32.597
...increasing the motivation of company employees all over the world.

00:34.037 --> 00:38.321
Mark realizes that standard motivational seminars are too expensive...

00:38.905 --> 00:41.257
...and require too much time from the learners.

00:41.405 --> 00:44.763
Moreover, many employees are simply bored of them.

00:46.439 --> 00:50.023
After some time-consuming efforts to find the best solution for his problem,...

00:50.673 --> 00:53.686
...Mark finally discovered blended learning.

00:56.037 --> 00:59.971
He found that blended learning is a mix of different learning environments...

01:00.458 --> 01:04.079
...such as face-to-face, e-learning, and self-education.

01:08.507 --> 01:11.177
Mark has agreed to have a meeting with Swiss Management School,...

01:11.539 --> 01:13.099
...the company that specializes in it.

01:14.489 --> 01:22.165
During the meeting, Mark finds out that his company will save time and money, as most of the education takes place online.

01:23.077 --> 01:27.965
Diverse learning materials make the learning process enjoyable, interesting, and varied.

01:28.981 --> 01:35.397
Mark, along with Swiss Management School, goes on to develop a number of tests, quizzes, and role-plays...

01:35.615 --> 01:38.265
...alongside other materials in different languages.

01:39.442 --> 01:43.979
These become available to every employee through a specially designed learning platform.

01:46.773 --> 01:50.173
Online webinars take place weekly with a qualified trainer.

01:52.419 --> 01:55.753
Trainers were also able to physically visit learners once a month...

01:56.328 --> 01:57.833
...to assist with any concerns.

01:59.587 --> 02:05.709
By the time the project was finished, Mark found that the employees' motivation had increased by 40%.

02:06.275 --> 02:10.993
Teamwork was much smoother, and even economic indicators increased.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.588
The board of directors were astonished.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.645
They were, to start with, skeptical.

02:18.301 --> 02:20.837
As for Mark, he was named "Employee of the Year."

02:21.448 --> 02:22.394
What a smart guy!

02:23.295 --> 02:24.602
This was blended learning,...

02:25.237 --> 02:27.089
...helping you always stay two steps ahead.
