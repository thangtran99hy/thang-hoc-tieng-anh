00:00.835 --> 00:04.337
New York is close to putting back what the terrorist took away.

00:04.805 --> 00:12.699
Workers on the new tower rising near Ground Zero are erecting steel for the 100th floor, on their way to 104.

00:14.553 --> 00:18.103
When 9/11/01 happened, I didn't know exactly what I could do.

00:18.822 --> 00:21.917
And then within a year later, my daughter was born on 9/11/02,...

00:22.554 --> 00:28.757
...and I got this huge thing that I wanted to have my daughter grow up knowing her birthday, what happened on that day,...

00:29.200 --> 00:31.002
...and then knowing her father was like a hero.

00:31.134 --> 00:32.010
He did something for it.

00:32.463 --> 00:35.541
So I waited until her second birthday: on 9/11/04, I swore in.

00:36.173 --> 00:39.448
And now I get to work here; it brings like another sense of pride.

00:40.045 --> 00:42.279
I joined right out of high school; I shipped off in 2000...

00:42.413 --> 00:45.598
...and the last thing I said to my family was, "Don't worry, it's not like anything is gonna happen."

00:46.233 --> 00:51.251
And I had just arrived at my duty station when September 11 happened.

00:51.621 --> 00:56.472
Being from New York, and going through what I've gone through, it's just an honor.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.688
It's a point of personal pride to be here now,...

01:00.973 --> 01:02.990
...working on any part of the World Trade Center.

01:03.341 --> 01:06.295
Once the towers came down, I knew it was inevitable I was gonna be deployed.

01:06.939 --> 01:07.669
They sent me out.

01:07.918 --> 01:08.633
I came back.

01:09.197 --> 01:10.868
Out of the whole city, this is where I wanted to work.

01:11.692 --> 01:14.623
It's almost my way of, I guess, giving back in a way.

01:15.252 --> 01:20.819
Being a soldier and going overseas, fighting for the country after it was under attack here...

01:21.109 --> 01:26.173
...means a lot to work here at the World Trade Center because I know people who lost parents here,...

01:26.992 --> 01:34.038
...siblings, friends; and I'm glad that I could be here, helping to bring back what we lost.
