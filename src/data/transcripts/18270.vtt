00:10.733 --> 00:15.033
Students end up being better qualified for whatever comes next,...

00:15.477 --> 00:18.716
...more enriched as individuals, cross-culturally aware.

00:19.781 --> 00:21.906
And that's what we wanna do as educators,...

00:22.239 --> 00:26.319
...is have our students as well-positioned as possible for the lives that they will lead.

00:26.822 --> 00:31.405
You are America's critical leaders to the global exchange community.

00:31.947 --> 00:37.885
You ensure a positive exchange experience by identifying host families in schools...

00:38.459 --> 00:44.154
...and by providing cross-cultural training, guidance, support, and so much more.

00:50.033 --> 00:57.100
The purpose of this conversation and the conference that we're here in today is to pull schools into the forefront...

00:57.340 --> 01:01.029
...and set up that partnership because they're in the education business.

01:01.393 --> 01:05.171
They're concerned about global competencies and other cultural education,...

01:05.455 --> 01:09.593
...but it enables us to build a partnership that makes all those kinds of things work together.

01:14.393 --> 01:20.506
I think it's very important now that you start a relationship with the school district on who is the contact person...

01:20.785 --> 01:23.739
...and then ask them some questions about what is their perception of...

01:23.868 --> 01:28.545
...what a foreign exchange student is and what is the role of a volunteer,...

01:28.898 --> 01:31.801
...and see what their perceptions are, and you can work with those.

01:32.207 --> 01:33.896
Walking the halls was not enough.

01:34.036 --> 01:35.273
They needed engagement.

01:35.866 --> 01:42.933
And so, not only did I have them engaged in my classes as far as speaking on particular topics,...

01:43.369 --> 01:48.382
...but I invited the faculty to have them for their classes.

01:48.472 --> 01:52.030
To be able to get to that at the middle school age is vital.

01:52.219 --> 01:55.700
They can go and be an exchange student, and they can go learn that new language,...

01:56.029 --> 01:59.316
...and yes, it's okay that they don't know it all before they go.

01:59.700 --> 02:01.882
So if this is something that they really wanna consider,...

02:01.989 --> 02:05.457
...not only do we need to talk to them, but we need to get it in front of their parents.

02:12.846 --> 02:18.955
I wish more people would see it as an essential component to life and to education.

02:19.243 --> 02:25.651
Our young people are our new policy makers, and so they need to be incorporated in this...

02:26.108 --> 02:30.154
...and have some experience of exchange and understanding at a young age.

02:30.634 --> 02:41.643
We need, as an organization, to do much better in not only reaching out but listening and learning from our own teachers.

02:42.165 --> 02:47.444
The goodwill, generosity, and mutual understanding fostered through exchange programs...

02:47.694 --> 02:50.731
... are critical to meeting the challenges of today's world.
