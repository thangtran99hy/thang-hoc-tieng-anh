We know that fire results from the combustion of organic material and oxygen,...

00:04.025 --> 00:06.205
...but don't you still sometimes wonder what fire is?

00:06.538 --> 00:08.813
Why are gas flames blue and wood fire orange?

00:09.040 --> 00:11.356
And why do flames move in such a mesmerizing way?

00:11.777 --> 00:15.904
Chemistry may tell us the recipe for combustion, but the light show is all physics.

00:16.231 --> 00:19.940
When a flame burns cleanly like a gas flame, blowtorch or the base of a candle,...

00:20.356 --> 00:24.824
...the heat excites the molecules to release light, usually pale blue, from atomic transitions.

00:25.133 --> 00:26.408
That's quantum mechanics.

00:26.739 --> 00:32.480
Now, when the fuel isn't as pure and doesn't entirely burn like wood fire or coal fire or the top of a candle flame,...

00:32.889 --> 00:33.855
...there's still some blue light,...

00:34.051 --> 00:37.848
...but you don't see it because it's overpowered by light from all the particles of soot and smoke.

00:38.165 --> 00:39.274
They're glowing red-hot!

00:39.581 --> 00:41.061
So why do hot objects glow?

00:41.443 --> 00:46.969
A process called black body radiation makes all objects glow with light of a color depending on their temperature.

00:47.254 --> 00:51.687
The reason that you don't see your friends glowing though, is because we're too cool to glow with visible light.

00:51.999 --> 00:53.195
We glow in infrared.

00:53.604 --> 00:59.035
But lava, a hot piece of iron, or soot in a flame are all hot enough to glow with that familiar red-orange light.

00:59.327 --> 01:02.519
And the reason flames are shaped like tongues snaking skywards?

01:02.926 --> 01:03.447
Gravity!

01:03.877 --> 01:05.833
The Earth's pull is what makes hot air rise,...

01:06.113 --> 01:09.109
...and this convection shapes flames into their familiar form.

01:09.401 --> 01:12.864
If you light a match in zero gravity, the flame spreads outwards like a balloon.

01:13.178 --> 01:14.595
There's nothing to tell it which way to go,...

01:14.974 --> 01:16.551
...so it goes in all directions.
