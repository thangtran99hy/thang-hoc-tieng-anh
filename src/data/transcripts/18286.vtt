00:06.225 --> 00:09.213
A vacation can be relaxing, exciting, and fun...

00:09.668 --> 00:12.081
...unless you and your travel partner spend the entire time...

00:12.215 --> 00:14.574
...arguing about where to go and what to do.

00:15.688 --> 00:18.739
You will need: an agenda, a budget,...

00:19.369 --> 00:23.771
...an ability to compromise, breaks and a sense of humor.

00:24.885 --> 00:26.787
Optional: an overnight trip.

00:27.373 --> 00:32.925
Step 1: Understand that different people like to experience traveling in different ways.

00:33.536 --> 00:36.856
One person may prefer to have a meticulously detailed schedule,...

00:37.063 --> 00:38.569
...while another may prefer to wing it.

00:39.643 --> 00:43.908
Test the waters by going away for only one night on your first trip with a travel partner.

00:44.960 --> 00:50.717
Step 2: Make an agenda, itemizing what each of you wants to see or do on the trip.

00:51.683 --> 00:56.311
Be open to any situations that arise on the trip that may be more fun or interesting...

00:56.531 --> 00:58.381
...than what is outlined in the itinerary.

00:59.449 --> 01:03.197
Step 3: Set up a budget for the trip that clearly outlines...

01:03.333 --> 01:05.181
...how much the trip is going to cost.

01:05.919 --> 01:09.977
Specify every expense and determine how much each person is responsible for.

01:11.069 --> 01:14.271
Step 4: Be willing to compromise.

01:14.823 --> 01:17.535
Compromise means that sometimes both parties have to give up...

01:17.644 --> 01:20.211
...a little of something they want to make each other happy.

01:21.339 --> 01:24.047
Step 5: Take a break from each other.

01:24.442 --> 01:28.189
If you have travel plans that conflict, or one of you wants to stay in the hotel,...

01:28.667 --> 01:30.489
...split off and meet back together later.

01:31.667 --> 01:35.685
Step 6: Work off each other's strengths and weaknesses.

01:36.244 --> 01:39.902
If your partner is better at planning, and you are better at taking pictures,...

01:40.315 --> 01:41.429
...then do what you are good at.

01:42.477 --> 01:45.435
Step 7: Have a sense of humor.

01:45.987 --> 01:47.508
It is often easier to get along...

01:47.629 --> 01:50.880
...when you and your partner can share a laugh about your travel experiences.

01:51.808 --> 01:52.515
Did you know?

01:52.853 --> 01:55.920
According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization,...

01:56.119 --> 02:01.767
...in 2008, international tourism generated 944 billion dollars.
