Visiting Paris can be rather expensive if you don't plan ahead.

00:05.285 --> 00:08.407
Here are a few money saving tricks that can help you stretch your budget...

00:08.568 --> 00:11.791
...and maximize the money you do spend while visiting Paris.

00:12.949 --> 00:14.121
Free, free, free.

00:14.657 --> 00:16.693
Just because places charge admission...

00:16.903 --> 00:18.443
...doesn't mean that they are worth your money.

00:19.196 --> 00:20.459
Want a great view of the city?

00:20.845 --> 00:23.041
Consider going to Montmartre in Sacre-Coeur,...

00:23.282 --> 00:25.377
...which is the highest point in all of Paris,...

00:25.701 --> 00:26.970
...rather than spending money...

00:27.073 --> 00:30.037
...and a lot of time going to the top of the Eiffel Tower.

00:30.908 --> 00:33.813
And speaking of free, there are a number of attractions...

00:34.017 --> 00:36.551
...in and around Paris that offer free admission.

00:36.921 --> 00:41.123
Like Notre Dame and Sacre-Coeur and other attractions like Versailles...

00:41.319 --> 00:44.925
...that offer discount entrance fees if you visit for half a day.

00:45.525 --> 00:49.991
So, plan ahead to find out about all the ways you can save money...

00:50.130 --> 00:51.755
...before your trip to Paris.

00:52.503 --> 00:54.935
You could purchase the attraction combo cards,...

00:55.062 --> 00:56.362
...which have various prices...

00:56.463 --> 00:58.785
...depending on how many days you plan to use them.

00:59.528 --> 01:03.053
The card offers free entrances to Paris's main attractions.

01:03.333 --> 01:07.021
One of their advantages is their free red bus tour offer,...

01:07.399 --> 01:09.177
...which is a great way to see the city.

01:09.769 --> 01:11.857
Use its hop off, hop on service...

01:11.984 --> 01:14.471
...to visit all the attractions that you plan to see.

01:17.103 --> 01:20.199
Picnics are a great alternative to spending money in restaurants.

01:20.660 --> 01:21.635
Once you're hungry,...

01:21.734 --> 01:24.915
...you can stop for a quick picnic at one of the fabulous gardens...

01:25.003 --> 01:27.824
...located throughout the entire city, saving your money...

01:27.989 --> 01:30.760
...to dine in one of the more popular restaurants in the evening.

01:31.201 --> 01:33.859
Finally, save money by saving time.

01:34.395 --> 01:37.399
Attractions in Paris often have long wait times...

01:37.599 --> 01:40.645
...and you didn't spend all the money and effort to visit the city...

01:40.748 --> 01:42.823
..only to see it from long wait lines.

01:43.451 --> 01:44.844
So, plan ahead.

01:45.416 --> 01:47.309
Good luck and bon voyage!
