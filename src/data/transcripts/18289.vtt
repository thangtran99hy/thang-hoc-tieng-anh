I'm Scott Stein and this is a very quick look at the brand-new iPhone 5...

00:04.207 --> 00:05.971
...that'll be available on September 21st.

00:06.345 --> 00:10.226
Now true to expectations, this is a larger four-inch screen,...

00:10.481 --> 00:11.519
...keeps the retina display,...

00:11.767 --> 00:17.795
...but it stretches out to a 16 : 9 aspect ratio and that does mean wider, larger movie playback.

00:18.305 --> 00:22.811
But it also should mean a lot of apps that are gonna be optimized for the extra screen real estate.

00:23.233 --> 00:24.985
Is a little bit of extra screen space a big deal?

00:25.087 --> 00:28.288
Well, it is if you want to have extra room above the keyboard.

00:28.647 --> 00:30.039
If you're gonna be pulling up messages,...

00:30.115 --> 00:31.753
...it means seeing more space up there.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.710
And the same is true for anything that uses a virtual keyboard.

00:35.319 --> 00:39.061
Plus, there may be new apps to take advantage of the extra space for buttons, or who knows what else.

00:39.488 --> 00:41.201
But that's not it, it's a top to bottom redesign.

00:41.283 --> 00:42.613
You're looking at a new connector port,...

00:42.907 --> 00:44.373
...a faster A6 processor,...

00:44.656 --> 00:46.442
...a speedier 4G LTE.

00:46.891 --> 00:49.562
It's thinner, 18% thinner; 20% lighter.

00:49.654 --> 00:51.707
And it feels really light in your hands,...

00:51.997 --> 00:53.619
...especially if you've held an iPhone 4.

00:54.247 --> 00:56.104
And the prices are the same as before.

00:56.223 --> 01:01.506
Plus, you get your fancy black or white but with metal backs now, slate or silver.

01:01.977 --> 01:06.730
I'm Scott Stein and that's a quick look with a lot more to come in Apple's new iPhone 5.
