00:00.217 --> 00:06.092
So, I danced to this new song, that I don't know if you all know about this "Gangnam Style"...

00:06.305 --> 00:11.199
...but this video is blowing up all over the place, and you tweeted out about it.

00:11.319 --> 00:11.531
Right?

00:11.617 --> 00:11.971
Yes!

00:12.112 --> 00:16.441
Alright, if you haven't seen it, let's just show them a little bit of this video, of how great this guy is.

00:16.513 --> 00:17.019
It's brilliant.

00:35.459 --> 00:36.820
He's fantastic, isn't he?

00:36.901 --> 00:37.093
Yes.

00:37.358 --> 00:37.767
Amazing!

00:37.850 --> 00:38.225
Alright!

00:41.264 --> 00:45.650
So, you actually tweeted out that you wanna learn that dance, right?

00:45.803 --> 00:46.131
Yes.

00:46.200 --> 00:49.163
Alright, so I got somebody here to teach you that dance.

00:49.242 --> 00:49.706
Oh!

00:49.977 --> 00:51.168
Psy, come on out!

00:58.755 --> 00:59.833
Oh my god!

01:00.465 --> 01:01.441
Oh my god!

01:03.140 --> 01:03.802
Oh my god!

01:08.259 --> 01:08.994
Nice to see you.

01:09.225 --> 01:09.873
Nice to see you.

01:14.373 --> 01:15.188
Fantastic!

01:16.176 --> 01:16.727
Alright!

01:19.096 --> 01:19.750
Go on!

01:20.286 --> 01:20.856
Show me!

01:22.095 --> 01:25.584
It looks easier than it is, but it's like a two and then one, right?

01:25.661 --> 01:26.323
How do you do it?

01:27.380 --> 01:29.778
You have to take your shoes off; you're not gonna be able to dance like that.

01:29.967 --> 01:39.921
This is fine because the mindset of this dance is to dress classy and dance cheesy, so there's a trend there.

01:40.672 --> 01:41.351
This is nice.

01:42.315 --> 01:42.661
Alright.

01:43.431 --> 01:46.625
And by the way, can I introduce myself?

01:46.776 --> 01:47.515
Yes, please do.

01:47.639 --> 01:48.405
Not just dancing?

01:48.510 --> 01:48.872
Okay.

01:49.121 --> 01:50.713
I'm Psy from Korea, how are you?

01:53.681 --> 01:54.758
Psy from Korea!

01:55.319 --> 01:55.853
We love you!

01:56.653 --> 01:57.070
Oh, really?

01:57.288 --> 01:59.904
We love you. You are amazing!

02:00.103 --> 02:00.403
Alright.

02:00.475 --> 02:04.685
Alright, so it goes like, one, and two, and three, and four.

02:05.725 --> 02:08.488
One, and two, and three, and four.

02:09.274 --> 02:09.971
Why don't you try?

02:10.505 --> 02:12.738
One, and two, and three, and four.

02:13.131 --> 02:20.547
And your hands have gotta be soft like this, and bounce like you're riding an invisible horse.

02:21.152 --> 02:24.483
Bounce like this, and then it goes like this.

02:26.751 --> 02:30.099
Alright. Theme of the music. One, two, three, four!

02:40.534 --> 02:40.995
Okay.

02:41.917 --> 02:42.963
That is Psy!
