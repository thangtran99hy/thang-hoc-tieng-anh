Hello, Ellen DeGeneres.

00:01.266 --> 00:05.447
This is your personalized weather forecast from the brand-new weather.com.

00:05.541 --> 00:09.470
Today, you can expect partly cloudy skies in the morning with the marine layer hanging around,...

00:09.575 --> 00:11.114
...mostly sunny by the afternoon.

00:11.379 --> 00:12.737
Looking good in Los Angeles,...

00:12.935 --> 00:19.111
...not quite merengue weather, but perhaps a good day for some calypso and a little pop and lock.

00:19.385 --> 00:21.645
High temperatures will reach the mid-60s.

00:21.717 --> 00:25.910
Temperatures like this will make you want to straddle your studio coffee table maybe,...

00:25.995 --> 00:29.407
...run into the audience and do some krumping with a random audience member.

00:29.778 --> 00:32.481
Overnight, lows are gonna drop into the low teens.

00:32.814 --> 00:33.653
Seriously, I'm kidding.

00:33.968 --> 00:35.647
The low will only be 55.

00:35.921 --> 00:41.068
If you don't have plans, you can always just stay home, rearrange your closet full of daytime Emmy statues,...

00:41.166 --> 00:43.910
...and spend the rest of the night reading bizarre Craigslist ads.

00:44.269 --> 00:49.632
And don't forget, check back anytime, weather.com, to see what's in store for Socal this weekend.
