A new hostel built inside a jumbo jet plane has now opened in Sweden's capital.

00:05.492 --> 00:11.103
And for those romantics who like flying high, a honeymoon suite is available in the jet's cockpit.

00:12.548 --> 00:18.417
The new jumbo jet hostel at Stockholm's Arlanda Airport offers flyers a whole new departure.

00:18.918 --> 00:22.285
Opening this week, the decommissioned Boeing 747...

00:22.507 --> 00:25.703
...has been completely refurbished to accommodate travelers,...

00:26.045 --> 00:28.831
...but this time under different circumstances.

00:29.483 --> 00:32.111
The 450 seats have been stripped out,...

00:32.542 --> 00:35.994
...and instead, there are now 25 bedrooms and nine bathrooms.

00:37.011 --> 00:42.102
Like any other self-respecting establishment, the Jumbo Hostel also boasts a honeymoon suite,...

00:42.393 --> 00:47.767
...sited in the cockpit naturally, and the only room on the plane with en suite bathroom facilities.

00:48.234 --> 00:50.061
And the wedding theme doesn't stop there.

00:50.367 --> 00:52.214
So, we're going to have their "wing walk,"...

00:52.473 --> 00:54.951
...and at the end of the wing walk, you can get married.

00:56.231 --> 00:59.175
Sited within walking distance of the airport terminals,...

00:59.288 --> 01:02.503
...where up to 18 million passengers pass through every year,...

01:02.878 --> 01:07.118
...the hostel's owner, Oscar Dios, is confident the enterprise will take off,...

01:07.447 --> 01:09.887
...now that the biggest challenge has been overcome.

01:10.269 --> 01:15.541
The most challenging with this project was trying to build something inside a metal hull;...

01:15.621 --> 01:18.125
...it's just really, really tight.

01:19.587 --> 01:22.471
It's very different from building a house.

01:22.927 --> 01:24.715
The construction issues resolved,...

01:24.874 --> 01:26.374
...the sky's the limit for Dios,...

01:26.648 --> 01:30.409
...who says he wants to build a fleet of jumbo jet hostels around the world.
