00:00.886 --> 00:05.786
On September 22nd, just five days after the battle of Antietam,...

00:06.117 --> 00:09.035
...the President issued his emancipation proclamation.

00:10.279 --> 00:13.425
"If my name ever goes into history," Lincoln said...

00:13.957 --> 00:15.505
..."it will be for this act."

00:17.847 --> 00:19.553
The South was outraged.

00:19.845 --> 00:24.750
Jefferson Davis called it, "the most execrable measure recorded in the history of guilty man."

00:36.633 --> 00:40.979
At a Washington dinner, John Hay, the President's 23-year-old secretary...

00:41.427 --> 00:45.387
...noted that everyone seemed to feel a new sort of exhilarating life.

00:46.131 --> 00:50.199
The President's proclamation had freed them as well as the slaves.

00:53.160 --> 00:58.813
"It was no longer a question of the Union, as it was that was to be reestablished.

00:59.219 --> 01:01.725
It was the Union as it should be,...

01:02.593 --> 01:06.862
...that is to say, 'washed clean from its original sin.'

01:08.135 --> 01:11.763
We were no longer merely the soldiers of a political controversy,...

01:12.508 --> 01:15.308
...we were now the missionaries of a great work of redemption;...

01:15.734 --> 01:17.725
...the armed liberators of millions.

01:18.923 --> 01:20.817
The war was ennobled.

01:21.917 --> 01:23.113
The object was higher."

01:26.405 --> 01:29.017
That December, Lincoln spoke to congress.

01:31.171 --> 01:35.533
"The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present.

01:36.462 --> 01:41.326
As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew.

01:42.245 --> 01:46.711
We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.

01:49.109 --> 01:52.669
Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history.

01:53.421 --> 01:59.225
The fiery trials through which we pass will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation.

02:01.016 --> 02:02.989
We say we are for Union.

02:04.035 --> 02:06.591
The world will not forget that we say this.

02:08.814 --> 02:13.651
In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free;...

02:14.649 --> 02:18.911
...honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve.

02:19.966 --> 02:26.195
We shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of earth."
