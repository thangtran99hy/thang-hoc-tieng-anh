Hello, I'm Negar Mortazavi with VOA 60 elections.

00:06.643 --> 00:11.667
For days, the media have been hurling tough questions at Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

00:12.172 --> 00:15.201
Yesterday, President Obama came in for some tough questioning.

00:15.599 --> 00:19.859
At a town hall meeting hosted by the Spanish language network Univision,...

00:20.107 --> 00:26.769
...CBS News says Obama was repeatedly asked why he broke promise of introducing comprehensive immigration reform...

00:27.115 --> 00:29.287
...during his first year in office.

00:29.708 --> 00:36.879
"A promise is a promise," said a Univision interviewer, "and with all due respect, but you didn't keep that promise."

00:37.114 --> 00:40.920
The president responded by blaming his Republican opposition in congress.

00:41.295 --> 00:47.718
Meanwhile, Fox News reports Obama had about 89 million dollars at the end of August to spend on his campaign.

00:48.056 --> 00:50.741
That's nearly twice as much as Romney had.

00:51.101 --> 00:56.668
And a new poll finds Obama leads Romney in battleground states of Colorado, Iowa and Wisconsin.

00:56.996 --> 01:03.597
In Colorado and Wisconsin, NBC News says Obama is ahead by five points and in Iowa, eight points.

01:03.695 --> 01:04.463
That's all for today.

01:04.562 --> 01:05.088
See you next time.
