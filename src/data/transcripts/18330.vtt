00:00.305 --> 00:04.543
You've worked hard all week: meetings, presentations, e-mails.

00:04.935 --> 00:06.212
More e-mails.

00:06.617 --> 00:08.409
And it's finally the weekend.

00:09.229 --> 00:12.755
Here's the trouble: we spend all week learning how to be productive,...

00:13.405 --> 00:15.676
...so it's hard to break the seal when Friday comes.

00:19.018 --> 00:20.639
You can try to avoid work,...

00:22.420 --> 00:23.647
...but you're still in work mode.

00:24.271 --> 00:28.717
See, the key to having a real break during the weekend is to do things that are not productive.

00:29.001 --> 00:33.415
So while turning off the phone is good, creating something with your bare hands is better.

00:34.071 --> 00:36.241
And while turning off the e-mail may be helpful,...

00:36.562 --> 00:40.909
...taking your family on a hiking trip to a state park will actually help you disconnect.

00:41.253 --> 00:45.206
So, do something this weekend that makes you focus on being unproductive,...

00:45.676 --> 00:48.223
...and it might just feel like a weekend again.
