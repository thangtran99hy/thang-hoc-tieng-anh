They are bitter rivals both gunning for America's top job.

00:09.161 --> 00:12.843
And with weeks to go before their first face-to-face presidential debate,...

00:13.269 --> 00:18.446
...the war of words between Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney is heating up.

00:20.305 --> 00:24.449
This country does not succeed when only a very few do well.

00:24.757 --> 00:30.791
We can't move forward if we've got leaders who write off half the nation,...

00:31.668 --> 00:33.189
...calling them a bunch of victims,...

00:33.402 --> 00:35.639

His slogan, of course, is "Forward."

00:42.906 --> 00:45.527

00:50.610 --> 00:51.935
We've seen this before.

00:52.533 --> 00:53.692
We can see it here.

00:54.004 --> 00:55.827
We can see it in Europe.

00:56.449 --> 00:58.555
We have to get America working again.

00:58.825 --> 01:00.857
We know how to make America work again.

01:01.383 --> 01:02.085
He doesn't.
