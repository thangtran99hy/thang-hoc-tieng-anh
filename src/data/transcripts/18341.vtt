Fewer Americans are working today than when President Obama took office.

00:04.413 --> 00:06.062
It doesn't have to be this way...

00:06.519 --> 00:08.398
...if Obama would stand up to China.

00:08.979 --> 00:12.007
China is stealing American ideas and technology,...

00:12.354 --> 00:14.673
...everything from computers to fighter jets.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.760
Seven times, Obama could have taken action.

00:18.019 --> 00:19.715
Seven times, he said no.

00:20.145 --> 00:22.645
His policies cost us two million jobs.

00:23.035 --> 00:25.203
Obama had years to stand up to China.

00:25.617 --> 00:27.551
We can't afford four more.

00:27.798 --> 00:29.871
I'm Mitt Romney, and I approve this message.
