Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!

00:02.100 --> 00:06.309
But, we're here in Korea and it's time to start Chuseok.

00:06.781 --> 00:10.749
Now, Chuseok is often billed as the Korean Thanksgiving.

00:11.125 --> 00:13.509
It is the autumn harvest festival...

00:14.102 --> 00:21.109
...and it always takes place on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar.

00:21.260 --> 00:27.186
Now it has its old history, surrounding a monthlong basket weaving competition.

00:27.425 --> 00:29.157
But today, it's not really celebrated that way.

00:29.232 --> 00:35.691
It's celebrated as, well, a great time for families to get together.

00:35.976 --> 00:37.149
So, this is what happens.

00:38.011 --> 00:41.225
You go to your ancestral hometown...

00:41.432 --> 00:49.146
...or the hometown of the oldest living family member, and everyone goes there.

00:49.475 --> 00:52.074
Now, it's typically celebrated over three days.

00:52.184 --> 00:58.370
However, the actual holiday can be looked at as a five-day festival and it's a lot of fun.

00:58.479 --> 01:01.315
During this time, families get together...

01:01.601 --> 01:06.064
...and they go to their ancestral burial grounds and pray for their ancestors.

01:06.913 --> 01:09.001
And they treat them with the utmost respect.

01:09.493 --> 01:12.974
In addition, families also get together and exchange gifts.

01:13.173 --> 01:16.768
I'm talking about a pretty interesting gift.

01:17.382 --> 01:21.811
Because it's a harvest festival, there are a lot of special fruit packages...

01:21.933 --> 01:24.131
...that are available this time of year.

01:24.815 --> 01:31.401
And on a daily basis, you may go to your grocer and get a few apples for maybe 5,000 won.

01:32.143 --> 01:35.697
During Chuseok, the apples are a little bit more special.

01:36.057 --> 01:37.418
They're huge!

01:37.935 --> 01:41.129
They're specially wrapped and cared for.

01:41.450 --> 01:45.827
And they're really grown specifically for the Chuseok gift exchange.

01:46.077 --> 01:52.474
As such, their prices are maybe 35, 45, 50,000 won for a box set.

01:52.911 --> 01:54.294
You may be asking yourself,...

01:54.625 --> 02:01.307
..."Can you taste the difference of 45,000 won in these two different types of fruits?"

02:02.532 --> 02:03.438
Yes, you can.

02:03.895 --> 02:09.961
The fruit that is grown and exchanged during Chuseok, it's amazing.

02:10.119 --> 02:13.483
The taste, the flavor is awesome!
