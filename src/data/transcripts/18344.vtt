Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan get it.

00:02.071 --> 00:03.273
Medicare's going broke.

00:03.665 --> 00:05.529
That's not politics, it's math.

00:06.153 --> 00:09.676
Anyone who wants to leave Medicare like it is, is for letting it go bankrupt.

00:10.289 --> 00:12.473
My mother's 81 and depends on Medicare.

00:12.937 --> 00:15.298
We can save Medicare without changing hers,...

00:15.651 --> 00:21.594
...but only if younger Americans accept that our Medicare will be different than our parents' when we retire in 30 years.

00:22.213 --> 00:23.764
But after all they did for us,...

00:24.447 --> 00:25.753
...isn't that the least we can do?

00:27.692 --> 00:29.819
I'm Mitt Romney, and I approve this message.
