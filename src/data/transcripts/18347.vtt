00:00.144 --> 00:03.197
This week on Extreme Makeover: Campaign Edition,...

00:03.733 --> 00:07.747
...Mitt Romney is faced with one of his most implausible makeovers yet:...

00:08.424 --> 00:12.557
...making his extreme policies seem appealing to Latino voters.

00:12.945 --> 00:15.305
I'm running for office, for Pete's sake; I can't have illegals.

00:15.442 --> 00:19.066
Romney only has a few short weeks to overhaul his positions...

00:19.194 --> 00:22.500
...and slow his declining popularity with Latino voters.

00:22.719 --> 00:27.961
Can he cover up his belief in self-deportation with a bold new wallpaper choice?

00:28.090 --> 00:32.409
The answer is self-deportation, which is people decide that they can do better by going home...

00:32.471 --> 00:33.861
...because they can't find work here.

00:34.155 --> 00:37.915
Could a new support beam handle the weight of Romney's plans...

00:38.003 --> 00:41.025
...to cut college scholarships for millions of students?

00:41.111 --> 00:43.527
The best thing I can do for you is to tell you to shop around.

00:43.640 --> 00:47.124
Can he dress up his economic plan with a new paint job...

00:47.602 --> 00:51.735
...to distract from the fact that he'd raise taxes for middle class Americans?

00:51.815 --> 00:56.875
Romney's proposal would provide large tax cuts to high-income households...

00:57.271 --> 01:02.350
...and increase the tax burdens on middle and/or lower income taxpayers.

01:03.209 --> 01:05.893
If he does something amazing with spackle,...

01:06.483 --> 01:09.645
...can he patch up his promise to repeal Obamacare...

01:10.019 --> 01:14.569
...and deny nine million Latinos access to comprehensive health care coverage?

01:14.702 --> 01:18.194
I will repeal Obamacare, and I'd kill it dead on its first day.

01:19.161 --> 01:21.515
And on his promise to veto the DREAM Act,...

01:21.903 --> 01:24.981
...well, duct tape can't fix everything, can it?

01:25.125 --> 01:29.565
The question is, if I were elected and Congress were to pass the DREAM Act, would I veto it?

01:29.639 --> 01:30.757
And the answer is yes.

01:31.135 --> 01:34.533
Tune in this week to Extreme Makeover: Campaign Edition...

01:34.727 --> 01:36.673
...to see what Mitt Romney will say,...

01:37.089 --> 01:40.549
...and learn more about how his policies hurt Latinos,...

01:40.871 --> 01:44.324
...not to mention seniors, young people, and middle class families.

01:44.524 --> 01:46.217
Move that bus!

01:46.420 --> 01:48.017
Move that bus!
