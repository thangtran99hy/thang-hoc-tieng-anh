So, you may have heard about Ponzi schemes in the news.

00:03.959 --> 00:07.477
Everybody knows they're illegal, but you might not understand how they work.

00:07.863 --> 00:09.255
So, Ben is here to show us.

00:09.516 --> 00:13.128
To start off, Ben gets a few people to invest their money with him.

00:13.469 --> 00:17.101
At the end of the year, he gives those clients amazing returns...

00:17.197 --> 00:19.199
...that beats every other investor in the market.

00:19.692 --> 00:22.061
Needless to say, the investors are thrilled.

00:23.069 --> 00:26.533
In fact, they're so ecstatic about all the money they're making...

00:27.047 --> 00:29.510
...that they tell all their friends and family about it too.

00:29.878 --> 00:32.524
Who tell their friends, who tell their friends.

00:33.096 --> 00:38.103
In the stock market, most investors make money some years and lose money others.

00:38.445 --> 00:39.753
But Ben's Ponzi scheme?

00:40.251 --> 00:42.085
Yeah, it never loses money.

00:42.480 --> 00:45.575
In fact, it always beats the market by a huge margin.

00:46.011 --> 00:50.375
But the returns he pays to these people aren't from actual profits.

00:50.711 --> 00:54.825
He just takes the money these new guys invest and gives it to these guys.

00:55.249 --> 00:59.755
But as soon as you can't get enough new money from this group to pay these people,...

01:00.148 --> 01:03.868
...then the whole pyramid starts to crumble because they're not getting paid anymore.

01:04.343 --> 01:07.602
Ben and these guys who invested first made a killing...

01:07.903 --> 01:09.701
...but these folks lost all their money.

01:10.595 --> 01:12.219
So the next time a guy like Ben...

01:12.297 --> 01:15.407
...tries to get you to invest in something that sounds too good to be true,...

01:15.779 --> 01:16.863
...it probably is.

01:17.439 --> 01:18.305
Just ask Ben.
