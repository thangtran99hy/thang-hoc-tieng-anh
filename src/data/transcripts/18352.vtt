00:27.767 --> 00:30.242
Maybe I won't make it, but if it's up to me I think I can do it.

00:32.352 --> 00:35.453
Terry Fox was an 18-year-old from British Columbia...

00:35.960 --> 00:39.294
...when he was diagnosed with bone cancer in his right knee.

00:40.736 --> 00:44.519
Amputation and chemotherapy left him with an artificial leg...

00:45.305 --> 00:48.246
...and memories of those still in the cancer ward.

00:49.515 --> 00:50.643
Kids my age and younger...

00:51.489 --> 00:55.937
...and you just can't leave something like that and forget it and I couldn't anyway.

00:56.385 --> 00:57.649
I had to try and do something about it.

00:59.035 --> 00:59.831
And so he did.

01:00.809 --> 01:03.451
Terry trained on his new leg for 14 months.

01:04.515 --> 01:08.545
Then told his family that he would run east to west across Canada,...

01:09.259 --> 01:12.666
...hoping to raise one million dollars for cancer research.

01:14.845 --> 01:19.701
On April 12, 1980 at the eastern most point of Canada, it began.

01:20.672 --> 01:21.959
The marathon of hope.

01:23.215 --> 01:26.387
And Terry would do it by running 26 miles.

01:27.659 --> 01:31.653
A marathon every single day.

01:33.777 --> 01:38.061
With his best friend Doug Alward and brother Darrell following in a support van,...

01:38.568 --> 01:42.947
...21-year-old Terry would rise at 4 AM to run 12 miles,...

01:43.401 --> 01:46.626
...rest, and do 14 miles in the afternoon,...

01:47.848 --> 01:51.555
...seeking donations across lowly expanses of highway.

01:55.651 --> 01:57.666
In Toronto, thousands cheered him.

01:58.343 --> 02:01.944
For Canadians, Terry had become an inspirational hero,...

02:03.667 --> 02:07.975
...but what inspired Terry were the children he was trying so hard to help,...

02:08.902 --> 02:10.600
...children like Greg Scott.

02:11.884 --> 02:15.191
I'm crying now because there's so many here right now...

02:15.720 --> 02:17.448
...that's going through the same thing that I went through,...

02:18.604 --> 02:20.514
...exact same thing, and he's only ten years old,...

02:23.911 --> 02:27.237
...and I had the most inspirational day of my life today.

02:29.507 --> 02:34.394
And so Terry gave himself an afternoon off from the marathon of hope to swim with Greg.

02:35.588 --> 02:39.757
It was just the fourth day off in 137 days on the road.

02:41.059 --> 02:48.953
As he approached the city of Thunder Bay on September 1st, Terry Fox had run 3,339 miles.

02:50.402 --> 02:56.317
He was on this stretch of road at this white marker when he asked to be taken to the hospital.

02:58.079 --> 03:02.011
From a stretcher, Terry shared the news of his diagnosis.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.295
The cancer had spread...

03:03.940 --> 03:05.425
...and now I've got cancer in my lungs.

03:06.257 --> 03:13.537
And I got to go home and try to do some more treatment,...

03:14.539 --> 03:23.767
...but all I can say is that if there's any way I can go out there again and finish it, I will.
