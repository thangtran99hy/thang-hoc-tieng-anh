I see the moon, and I know it sees me.

00:08.737 --> 00:11.569
But do you know what some people see on the moon?

00:15.458 --> 00:18.615
My mom says she sees a man on the moon.

00:20.912 --> 00:23.926
My grandma sees a rabbit on the moon.

00:24.642 --> 00:26.140
Ha ha, cute little bunny.

00:29.271 --> 00:33.998
I even have a book about a kitty cat who thinks the moon is a bowl of milk.

00:36.782 --> 00:42.517
My dad told me how some people throughout Asia have fun stories about the moon.

00:43.903 --> 00:47.536
Some people think flowers fall from the moon when it is full.

00:48.743 --> 00:50.547
Wow, I like that.

00:51.580 --> 00:53.911
He said the flowers bring good luck.

00:57.053 --> 01:00.549
But the most famous story is about the goddess of the moon...

01:00.937 --> 01:05.671
...who magically flew to the moon and lived there in a jade palace.

01:09.123 --> 01:13.950
My parents took me to the Harvest Moon Festival in San Francisco, California.

01:16.778 --> 01:21.603
Some people think this is like a giant birthday party for the goddess.

01:23.888 --> 01:26.249
There were all kinds of dancers.

01:32.620 --> 01:34.984
Look at those pretty dresses.

01:38.128 --> 01:40.297
The kung fu looked really cool.

01:46.210 --> 01:49.958
I want to know how to do that, then I'd be awesome.

01:52.425 --> 01:54.821
I even got to see the lion dancers.

01:55.918 --> 01:58.230
It might look scary, but it's not.

01:59.733 --> 02:03.211
See, there's a man underneath the costume holding up the head...

02:03.568 --> 02:06.983
...making it look like the lion's mouth is opening and closing.

02:08.915 --> 02:14.073
Then, other people hold up the rest of the costume to make up the lion's body.

02:14.704 --> 02:18.135
They say the lion's visit gives us all good luck.

02:19.623 --> 02:22.646
My favorite though, was the drummers.

02:27.452 --> 02:31.402
Other than all of that fun stuff, I just like playing around.

02:33.117 --> 02:35.561
Plus, did I mention the mooncakes?

02:35.779 --> 02:36.847
Yum!

02:38.508 --> 02:41.505
So, I had a lot of fun at the Harvest Moon Festival.

02:44.324 --> 02:49.000
And now every time I see the moon, I think about how much fun it is...

02:49.335 --> 02:51.270
...to have these special stories to share.
