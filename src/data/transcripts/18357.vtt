With dozens of reasons to love 'em, eggs are one of our best food buys.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.899
So today, we came to an egg farm...

00:09.229 --> 00:15.971
...to get a behind-the-scenes look at just how one of our most preferred foods gets from the hen houses to our houses.

00:16.635 --> 00:19.426
And it all starts in a temperature-controlled hen house,...

00:19.939 --> 00:25.241
...where hens are treated to a healthy blend of feed that's packed with vitamins and corn and soy bean.

00:25.453 --> 00:28.819
Well, in fact, they probably eat a better balanced diet than most people.

00:29.468 --> 00:31.821
And apparently the hens are early risers,...

00:32.233 --> 00:34.101
...because most of the eggs are laid in the morning.

00:34.503 --> 00:38.033
You see, the eggs drop automatically onto the conveyor belt...

00:38.408 --> 00:39.798
...before being moved down the line..

00:40.097 --> 00:41.790
...where they're washed and sanitized,...

00:42.191 --> 00:43.959
...making sure that they're nice and clean.

00:44.420 --> 00:49.857
And here alone, they produce more than one and a half million eggs every single day.

00:50.651 --> 00:53.387
Now next, the cameras take photos of every egg...

00:53.450 --> 00:57.393
...and computers check them out to make sure that each meets strict standards,...

00:57.977 --> 01:01.779
...before every egg is rated based on size and quality.

01:02.237 --> 01:07.312
And finally, the eggs are carefully packed, and boxed and delivered to our markets.

01:07.935 --> 01:14.647
Did you know that the average egg is in our market within 24 hours of being laid?

01:15.103 --> 01:17.231
Now, that's farm fresh.
