00:00.839 --> 00:03.408
My family has worked in the coal industry for over 60 years.

00:03.506 --> 00:04.765
This is the way of life we know.

00:06.395 --> 00:11.478
Policies that the current administration's got is attacking my livelihood.

00:12.893 --> 00:16.815
Obama, I bet he was going bankrupt to any new power plants that opened up that's coal-fired...

00:17.125 --> 00:18.210
...and he's keeping his promise.

00:19.587 --> 00:23.312
I got two young grandsons and I'm scared for their future, let alone mine.

00:24.340 --> 00:25.512
I support Mitt Romney.

00:26.767 --> 00:29.101
I'm Mitt Romney and I approve this message.
