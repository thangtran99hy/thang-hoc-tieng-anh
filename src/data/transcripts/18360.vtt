Mitt Romney attacked 47 percent of Americans who pay no income tax,...

00:04.566 --> 00:07.266
...including veterans, elderly, the disabled.

00:07.423 --> 00:10.076
My job is not to worry about those people.

00:10.272 --> 00:12.647
Doesn't the President have to worry about everyone?

00:13.024 --> 00:16.791
Mitt Romney paid just 14.1 percent in taxes last year.

00:17.071 --> 00:19.691
He keeps millions in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.

00:19.925 --> 00:22.783
He won't release his tax returns before 2010.

00:23.036 --> 00:27.632
Maybe instead of attacking others on taxes, Romney should come clean on his.

00:27.966 --> 00:29.875
I'm Barack Obama, and I approve this message.
