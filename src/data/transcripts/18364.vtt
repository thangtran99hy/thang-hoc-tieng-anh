00:00.581 --> 00:02.558
My plan is to help the middle class.

00:03.279 --> 00:04.760
Trade has to work for America.

00:05.191 --> 00:07.200
That means crack down on cheaters like China.

00:07.301 --> 00:08.697
It means open up new markets.

00:08.958 --> 00:10.743
Next, you've got to balance the budget.

00:11.119 --> 00:12.513
You've got to cut the deficit.

00:12.721 --> 00:15.377
You've got to stop spending more money than we take in.

00:15.725 --> 00:18.237
And finally, champion small business.

00:18.490 --> 00:23.499
Have tax policies, regulations and healthcare policies that help small business.

00:23.655 --> 00:27.397
We put those in place, we'll add 12 million new jobs in four years.

00:27.505 --> 00:29.436
I'm Mitt Romney and I approve this message.
