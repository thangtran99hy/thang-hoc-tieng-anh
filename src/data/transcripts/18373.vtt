There's someone who works in our building here...

00:03.667 --> 00:06.186
...who has a disability, who's been with us 16 years.

00:06.819 --> 00:13.641
His name is Kenny and I take Kenny out to lunch about two, three times a year...

00:14.347 --> 00:21.181
...and whenever I walk back after that lunch, that day is very different for me.

00:22.115 --> 00:27.681
I find myself taking a step back and really appreciating all that we have...

00:27.861 --> 00:35.296
...and also valuing the company in a way because of the way in which we've opened the doors for Kenny,...

00:35.375 --> 00:38.757
...and I think brought him something in his life that he probably won't have had.

00:39.384 --> 00:43.841
And also, I'm amazed how many people celebrate Kenny in this building...

00:45.359 --> 00:47.362
...whether it's his birthday, his anniversary.

00:47.755 --> 00:49.939
People know his family, his coach.

00:51.337 --> 00:54.565
It's added a dimension to the company...

00:54.943 --> 00:59.227
...in a way that I can't properly explain, but it's made us better people.
