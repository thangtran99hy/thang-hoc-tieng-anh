Hey, Laura Roeder here...

00:01.869 --> 00:06.421
...and I just wanted to give you a really quick, simple, easy answer to the question...

00:06.715 --> 00:10.231
..."How can I use Facebook to market my small business?"

00:10.590 --> 00:13.747
So, I have a three-step strategy for using Facebook.

00:14.264 --> 00:19.478
The first step is tell people that your Facebook page exists.

00:19.919 --> 00:21.519
That step seems pretty obvious...

00:21.623 --> 00:23.787
...but I'm guessing you could do a much better job with it.

00:24.066 --> 00:26.645
So, most entrepreneurs make a Facebook page,...

00:26.911 --> 00:30.545
...they send out one email that says, "Like my page!"

00:30.996 --> 00:32.903
And if people don't respond to that email...

00:32.981 --> 00:35.686
...or if someone comes to your world after you send that email,...

00:35.837 --> 00:37.214
...they never find out about your page.

00:37.499 --> 00:41.927
So, you need to think about your prospect and then customer timeline,...

00:42.021 --> 00:44.509
...all the different ways and places they can interact with you...

00:44.571 --> 00:48.415
...and put regular touchpoints sending people to Facebook.

00:48.879 --> 00:51.830
Step two is just schedule your status updates.

00:51.909 --> 00:53.820
Schedule your content on Facebook.

00:54.249 --> 00:55.684
You can automate this.

00:55.753 --> 00:58.903
You do not need to spend a lot of live time on social media,...

00:59.028 --> 01:00.251
...really doesn't take that much time.

01:00.647 --> 01:06.227
So, I want you to schedule... First of all, if you have content going out like videos and blog posts,...

01:06.752 --> 01:10.105
...there's no reason for you to be manually updating Facebook without this,...

01:10.259 --> 01:14.712
...it's really easy using tools like Hootsuite or Ping.fm....

01:14.966 --> 01:18.996
...to automatically feed your new blog posts and your new videos into Facebook.

01:19.073 --> 01:20.249
So first, set that up...

01:20.551 --> 01:23.788
...and then you can use Hootsuite to schedule out status updates.

01:24.189 --> 01:27.330
You can ask questions, get people involved,...

01:27.509 --> 01:29.410
...get people talking on your Facebook page.

01:30.122 --> 01:31.597
Schedule all that stuff up.

01:31.761 --> 01:34.859
Again, you don't need to spend a lot of live time updating Facebook.

01:35.387 --> 01:37.851
The third step where you should be spending your time...

01:38.009 --> 01:40.437
...is engaging with your Facebook community.

01:40.956 --> 01:44.827
Post answers to questions people ask.

01:45.138 --> 01:48.967
That seems obvious but again, are you doing it systematically?

01:49.246 --> 01:53.318
Are you saying "thanks for stopping by" when people post on your page?

01:53.646 --> 01:59.382
Do you have a strategy and a plan and a schedule for interacting with people on Facebook?

01:59.727 --> 02:03.164
The simple act of responding and engaging and interacting,...

02:03.489 --> 02:08.445
...gets you much more customers communicating with you on Facebook.

02:08.757 --> 02:12.251
So, now you know a really simple three-step strategy...

02:12.546 --> 02:15.212
...for using Facebook to market your small business.
