Tomorrow, in a very real sense, your life,...

00:05.912 --> 00:10.435
...the life you author from scratch on your own, begins.

00:12.281 --> 00:13.620
How will you use your gifts?

00:14.263 --> 00:15.630
What choices will you make?

00:16.849 --> 00:22.307
Will inertia be your guide or will you follow your passions?

00:24.371 --> 00:28.004
Will you follow dogma or will you be original?

00:30.325 --> 00:35.982
Will you choose a life of ease or a life of service and adventure?

00:38.126 --> 00:44.103
Will you wilt under criticism or will you follow your convictions?

00:45.624 --> 00:49.898
Will you bluff it out when you're wrong or will you apologize?

00:52.492 --> 00:59.791
Will you guard your heart against rejection or will you act when you fall in love?

01:01.650 --> 01:05.940
Will you play it safe or will you be a little bit swashbuckling?

01:08.017 --> 01:13.681
When it's tough, will you give up or will you be relentless?

01:17.199 --> 01:21.874
Will you be a cynic or will you be a builder?

01:25.782 --> 01:33.709
Will you be clever at the expense of others or will you be kind?

01:39.633 --> 01:40.916
I will hazard a prediction.

01:42.551 --> 01:49.690
When you are 80 years old and in a quiet moment of reflection,...

01:50.857 --> 01:52.814
...narrating for only yourself,...

01:53.935 --> 01:57.524
...the most personal version of your life story,...

02:00.021 --> 02:04.627
...the telling that will be most compact and meaningful,...

02:05.705 --> 02:08.314
...will be the series of choices you have made.

02:09.768 --> 02:12.753
In the end, we are our choices.

02:13.989 --> 02:16.803
Build yourself a great story.

02:17.816 --> 02:19.222
Thank you and good luck.
