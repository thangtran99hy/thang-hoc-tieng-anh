00:00.482 --> 00:02.545
Come, travel back in time with me...

00:02.986 --> 00:06.845
...as we explore the brief history of Halloween.

00:09.627 --> 00:12.555
Today, children still go trick-or-treating,...

00:12.939 --> 00:17.067
...a descendant of souling and many other customs that came to us...

00:17.445 --> 00:19.325
...all the way back to the ancient Celts.

00:20.116 --> 00:21.939
Today, we carve pumpkins,...

00:22.345 --> 00:26.787
...put out symbols of witches, ghosts, black cats, and fortune-tellers.

00:27.665 --> 00:31.589
We tell scary ghost stories, watch scary horror movies,...

00:32.057 --> 00:34.619
...and dress up in all kinds of costumes,...

00:34.991 --> 00:37.195
...not just scary ones or animal ones.

00:38.329 --> 00:42.883
Because of safety issues, as well as some conservative religious beliefs,...

00:43.291 --> 00:47.431
...some communities, churches, and civic organizations...

00:47.825 --> 00:50.842
...have been offering alternatives to trick-or-treating...

00:51.149 --> 00:52.854
...or even Halloween itself,...

00:53.355 --> 00:55.351
...from simple fall celebrations...

00:55.755 --> 00:58.687
...to costume parties replete with food and candy.

00:59.772 --> 01:01.329
Over the past ten years,...

01:01.645 --> 01:05.612
...Halloween has gone from a children's night of free candy and games,...

01:05.949 --> 01:07.235
...spooks and scares...

01:07.777 --> 01:11.246
....to one of the most profitable days of the year for costumers...

01:11.561 --> 01:13.135
...and sellers of costume makeup,...

00:00.000 --> 01:18.373
...as adults, young and old, have become enamored with this special day.
