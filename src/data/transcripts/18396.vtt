Nicely done, show-off.

00:38.704 --> 00:41.161
Zoe, I know how you feel.

00:41.628 --> 00:45.113
I can't think of anything harder than a girl losing her father.

00:46.121 --> 00:47.956
But nothing we do can bring him back.

00:50.877 --> 00:52.243
Alright everyone, pay attention.

00:52.679 --> 00:54.015
Victor Costa.

00:56.193 --> 00:56.898
Yes, sweetie.

00:57.607 --> 00:59.199
That's the man who shot your father.

01:00.141 --> 01:01.097
Mommy's gonna find him.

01:05.711 --> 01:06.851
Wilfred, shut up!

01:07.997 --> 01:09.386
Ah, there you are.

01:09.747 --> 01:10.437
What kept you?

01:12.119 --> 01:14.184
Now then, what have you got for me?

01:16.632 --> 01:17.429
Get her, boys!

01:17.763 --> 01:19.137
What are you waiting for?

01:21.115 --> 01:22.209
I need you to trust me.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.161
Just climb on my back and hold on.

01:28.179 --> 01:29.103
They kidnapped her.

01:32.491 --> 01:34.319
Get off me, you filthy beast!

01:41.374 --> 01:43.518
Ah, we haven't been introduced.

01:44.057 --> 01:45.067
I'm Nico.

01:45.918 --> 01:46.593
What's the matter?

01:47.521 --> 01:48.371
Cat got your tongue?
