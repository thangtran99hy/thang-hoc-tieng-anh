It could be said that the two most influential Britons of the past 30 years...

00:04.277 --> 00:06.745
...are Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web,...

00:07.068 --> 00:11.578
...and you, who have given us the iPod and all the train of Apple products.

00:11.976 --> 00:13.878
And yet you both choose to live and work in America.

00:13.961 --> 00:17.534
I wonder if that says something about Britain, or more importantly about America.

00:17.851 --> 00:29.940
I think that there's just a conspicuous lack of cynicism and skepticism.

00:30.193 --> 00:33.107
And ideas are so fragile, aren't they?

00:34.053 --> 00:37.322
It's so easy to sort of miss an idea...

00:38.764 --> 00:42.007
...because they can be so quiet, or to snuff an idea out.

00:42.378 --> 00:57.279
I think that the sense of the inquisitiveness and the willingness to try is so important for design,...

00:57.377 --> 01:02.788
...for developing those tentative, fragile ideas into a real product.
