00:03.199 --> 00:05.501
This is the story of a girl named Annie...

00:06.429 --> 00:07.849
...who dreamed she could fly.

00:09.124 --> 00:11.628
There were the doubters, the nonbelievers,...

00:12.098 --> 00:13.883
...the no-way-you-can-do-it-ers.

00:18.749 --> 00:20.851
But like others that braved the sky before her,...

00:21.619 --> 00:22.885
...it took a mighty machine,...

00:24.503 --> 00:25.706
...brilliant ingenuity,...

00:28.267 --> 00:32.306
...and plain old stubbornness, to go where no fifth grader had gone before.

00:42.955 --> 00:44.751
And she flew, and she soared...

00:45.077 --> 00:49.821
...above the school yard and even over that Eliza Jones, and beyond.

00:50.418 --> 00:53.328
My name is Annie and I'm the girl who dreamed she could fly.
