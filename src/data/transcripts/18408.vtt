00:02.244 --> 00:07.591
One of the first political debates in the US took place in Illinois in 1858.

00:07.993 --> 00:14.560
Senatorial candidates Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas stood on this rock and argued over slavery.

00:15.084 --> 00:18.865
Lincoln lost the race, but went on to win the presidency two years later.

00:19.353 --> 00:22.023
10,000 people watched the debate in this park.

00:22.677 --> 00:30.421
Fast-forward 100 years, and many more would watch a presidential debate on a fairly young technology called television.

00:30.744 --> 00:32.503
Are we doing as much as we can do?

00:32.805 --> 00:39.921
A tanned Senator John F. Kennedy visually overpowered an uncomfortable and sweaty Vice President Richard Nixon.

00:40.521 --> 00:43.277
Journalist Howard K. Smith moderated the debate.

00:43.601 --> 00:48.851
We offered Nixon makeup, but in those days television was still new to politicians,...

00:49.344 --> 00:54.327
...and it was considered effeminate to have makeup, so he refused it.

00:54.769 --> 00:58.431
Kennedy won the election, some say partially due to the debate.

00:59.021 --> 01:04.822
It was 16 years before another presidential debate would be held, and it appeared costly for the incumbent.

01:05.258 --> 01:12.603
President Gerald Ford made an understatement about Russia when facing challenger Jimmy Carter, and he eventually lost the election.

01:12.787 --> 01:20.238
There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration.

01:20.619 --> 01:21.489
Senator Bentsen.

01:22.078 --> 01:29.626
In 1988, Democratic Vice Presidential Candidate Lloyd Bentsen scored high in this retort to his Republican rival Dan Quayle.

01:29.921 --> 01:30.659
First, Quayle.

01:30.973 --> 01:37.043
I have as much experience in the congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency.

01:37.917 --> 01:39.605
I served with Jack Kennedy.

01:40.139 --> 01:41.285
I knew Jack Kennedy.

01:42.366 --> 01:43.954
Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine.

01:45.177 --> 01:46.850
Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.

01:47.688 --> 01:49.751
The Republicans won the election anyway.

01:50.031 --> 01:52.013
George H. W. Bush became president.

01:52.449 --> 01:54.913
In 1992, he ran for reelection.

01:55.425 --> 02:00.700
In one debate, television cameras caught him glancing at his wristwatch as if uninterested.

02:01.020 --> 02:02.157
He lost the election.

02:02.755 --> 02:05.773
Debates can be the tipping point in close elections.

02:06.101 --> 02:11.628
That's because it's the first time Americans see both candidates together on the same stage,...

02:11.928 --> 02:17.390
...debating the same issues, but explaining why their ideas are better than their opponent's.

02:18.099 --> 02:23.746
Every four years, presidential candidates spar at three debates; the first debate attracts the largest audience.

02:24.066 --> 02:26.965
Another is a town hall with questions from the floor.

02:27.527 --> 02:30.712
President Obama appeared relaxed in that debate four years ago.

02:30.927 --> 02:34.123
I understand your frustration and your cynicism.

02:34.639 --> 02:36.968
I have credibility in the economy when he doesn't

02:37.353 --> 02:41.929
But many agree Mitt Romney is a skilled speaker, especially when he's prepared.

02:42.540 --> 02:45.771
