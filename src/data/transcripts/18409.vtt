While most jewelry comes from precious stones and jewels found in the earth,...

00:03.664 --> 00:06.758
...you've heard that pearls all round and shiny, come from oysters...

00:06.831 --> 00:12.227
...which just so happen to gracefully open their mouths and let us take the perfectly formed gem for our own use.

00:12.457 --> 00:13.593
Sounds right, right?

00:14.099 --> 00:15.846
Well, if not, why did they make pearls?

00:16.128 --> 00:21.573
As it turns out, shelled mollusks such as oysters create pearls as an immune response to foreign objects.

00:21.975 --> 00:24.988
Oysters are bivalves which means their shell has two parts.

00:25.064 --> 00:27.335
Inside these shells is an organ called the mantle,...

00:27.409 --> 00:31.146
...which releases a substance called nacre made primarily of calcium carbonate.

00:31.425 --> 00:34.114
This nacre is responsible for the production of the shell.

00:34.309 --> 00:38.883
Pearls are formed when a foreign substance or parasite makes its way between the shell and the mantle.

00:39.015 --> 00:41.945
This usually happens when the oyster has opened its shell for feeding.

00:42.285 --> 00:44.053
The foreign object gets into the mollusk,...

00:44.269 --> 00:46.595
...which then releases nacre as a protective measure,...

00:46.725 --> 00:48.857
...wrapping the foreign object up many times over.

00:49.219 --> 00:51.417
This process is similar to when you get a splinter.

00:51.617 --> 00:54.593
And happens over years, eventually forming a beautiful pearl.

00:54.874 --> 00:57.410
Unfortunately for you, splinters don't make pearls.

00:57.659 --> 01:00.481
Over the years, scientists have taken advantage of this phenomenon...

01:00.557 --> 01:03.994
...by harvesting oysters and inserting foreign objects into their mantle.

01:04.429 --> 01:09.032
But these cultured pearls aren't nearly as valuable as their rare natural counterparts,...

01:09.397 --> 01:10.765
...one of nature's many gems.
