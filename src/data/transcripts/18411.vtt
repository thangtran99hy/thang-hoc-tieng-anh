I don't want to spread no more of that violence in the air.

00:04.700 --> 00:06.677
I just want to hang out and entertain now.

00:07.171 --> 00:08.014
I want to dance and sing.

00:08.101 --> 00:09.313
I want to be like Billy Madison.

00:09.383 --> 00:10.497
Remember that show? Anybody see that?

00:10.703 --> 00:13.214
Billy Madison is a boxer, and he turns into a ballet singer,...

00:13.815 --> 00:14.583
...ballet dancer.

00:16.660 --> 00:18.941
I just don't have the desire to be that guy anymore.

00:19.215 --> 00:22.106
I was explaining before, me being that guy, I couldn't have lived well...

00:22.169 --> 00:24.445
...I could never have a relationship with my wife and my children.

00:24.745 --> 00:26.819
That guy takes up so much of my life,...

00:27.196 --> 00:31.829
...that I, Mike, whoever the hell that guy is, he just takes up too much and not in a good perspective either.

00:31.985 --> 00:34.167
I do have some plans to play characters and stuff.

00:34.229 --> 00:35.407
I play myself pretty good.

00:35.483 --> 00:37.187
I'm a pretty interesting character.

00:37.443 --> 00:38.241
You know, I am a character.

00:38.320 --> 00:39.373
Mike Tyson is a character,...

00:39.440 --> 00:41.258
...and playing myself is playing a character.

00:42.431 --> 00:44.287
I get paid like I'm playing somebody else too.

00:44.359 --> 00:46.785
So, if the show is gonna play Mike Tyson,...

00:46.869 --> 00:50.512
...other guys are being paid much money being me...

00:50.789 --> 00:53.191
...so being me is pretty profitable.
