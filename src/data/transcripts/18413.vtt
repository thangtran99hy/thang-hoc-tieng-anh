Come on, Katie! Time to brush our teeth before we go to bed.

00:05.613 --> 00:07.482
Why do I have to brush my teeth?

00:08.597 --> 00:11.755
You need to brush your teeth to keep them clean and healthy.

00:12.371 --> 00:13.222
Why?

00:13.710 --> 00:17.073
When you eat, food can get stuck between your teeth.

00:17.763 --> 00:18.693
Is that bad?

00:19.909 --> 00:22.909
Well, it can make your teeth go bad.

00:23.444 --> 00:25.061
And then they fall out!

00:25.516 --> 00:29.505
Hmm... like the way your teeth fell out?

00:30.650 --> 00:37.567
Well, my teeth fell out, well, my baby teeth, everybody loses their baby teeth when they're growing up.

00:38.510 --> 00:40.931
And then they get more teeth, like you did.

00:41.177 --> 00:43.511
Yes! You get grown-up teeth.

00:44.883 --> 00:47.046
But they have to last forever.

00:48.147 --> 00:49.503
You don't get any more.

00:50.311 --> 00:53.746
Oh, how can I stop my teeth from going bad?

00:54.351 --> 01:00.554
Well, when you brush your teeth you can clean away all bits of food that might be stuck between them.

01:01.192 --> 01:01.977
Like this?

01:03.312 --> 01:03.819
Yes.

01:04.590 --> 01:08.347
Make sure you clean all your teeth even the ones at the back...

01:08.763 --> 01:10.461
...and don't forget your gums.

01:10.896 --> 01:12.037
What are gums?

01:12.253 --> 01:18.041
Your gums hold your teeth onto your mouth so it's really important to look after them too.

01:19.625 --> 01:22.082
I think all my teeth are clean now, look.

01:22.285 --> 01:23.469
They're very clean.

01:24.328 --> 01:26.601
Keep brushing your teeth every day...

01:27.320 --> 01:30.844
...and you'll be able to keep that lovely, shiny white smile.
