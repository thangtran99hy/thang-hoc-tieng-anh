00:11.011 --> 00:11.506
Right.

00:12.093 --> 00:14.772
Let's get going or we'll be late for school.

00:14.992 --> 00:16.598
Why do I have to go to school?

00:16.822 --> 00:19.338
There are lots of reasons why we have to go to school.

00:19.618 --> 00:23.421
The main reason for going to school is to learn new things.

00:23.528 --> 00:26.001
Like I learned how to count to 20 yesterday?

00:26.085 --> 00:26.602
Yes!

00:26.801 --> 00:27.628
Or how to read,...

00:27.975 --> 00:28.809
...how to write,...

00:29.134 --> 00:30.111
...play music,...

00:30.375 --> 00:31.533
...to use the computer.

00:31.856 --> 00:34.787
I learned a new dance in school and a new song.

00:34.969 --> 00:36.434
What else do you do in school?

00:36.542 --> 00:38.152
I play with my friends.

00:38.337 --> 00:41.971
So school also helps you to meet new friends and play with them.

00:42.266 --> 00:47.075
Sometimes I share my crayons with Julie and she shares her markers with me.

00:47.282 --> 00:50.067
So school gives us a chance to share things together.

00:50.357 --> 00:52.833
Sometimes I work on a picture by myself...

00:53.103 --> 00:56.654
...and sometimes I work hard with my friends to make things.

00:56.757 --> 01:03.303
So in school we learn how to work together with our friends and how to work on our own.

01:03.516 --> 01:07.737
Sometimes we have teams and I have to wait till it's my turn to run.

01:08.061 --> 01:10.403
I get very excited when I'm doing sports.

01:10.535 --> 01:12.149
It's important to exercise.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.585
And school helps us to exercise in a fun way.

01:16.401 --> 01:18.048
Do you know what else I like doing in school?

01:18.197 --> 01:18.765
What's that?

01:18.928 --> 01:21.126
Next week I'm going to be in a concert...

01:21.314 --> 01:24.520
...and I'm going to be the wolf and you can come watch me, yeah!

01:24.975 --> 01:25.766
I'd love to.

01:26.039 --> 01:30.097
And then you can come and watch me on my sports day, running and jumping.

01:30.671 --> 01:33.907
So there's lots of things I can do in school with my friends...

01:34.069 --> 01:36.341
...that I might not be able to do at home on my own.

01:36.417 --> 01:37.121
That's true.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.349
It's great to come home from school,...

01:39.588 --> 01:43.365
...to have your dinner and to play and talk and have a rest!

01:43.520 --> 01:43.961
Yes.

01:44.196 --> 01:48.795
And it's also great to go into school and meet your teachers and your friends.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.980
And all the new things you can learn,...

01:51.235 --> 01:55.580
...like answers to some of these questions you keep asking me!
