00:13.273 --> 00:15.031
It's time for us to go to bed now.

00:15.845 --> 00:18.394
Oh! Why do I have to go to bed now?

00:18.491 --> 00:19.870
To go to sleep, of course.

00:19.948 --> 00:21.530
But why do I have to go to sleep?

00:21.654 --> 00:24.426
You don't really do anything when you're asleep, do you?

00:24.505 --> 00:25.411
You do, actually.

00:26.307 --> 00:28.753
And sleeping is important for everybody.

00:28.834 --> 00:30.633
Why is it important to sleep?

00:31.151 --> 00:33.116
Well, for a few reasons.

00:33.951 --> 00:38.163
When you're asleep, your brain helps to sort out different things you've been doing;...

00:38.734 --> 00:40.992
...thinking and learning during the day.

00:41.377 --> 00:43.815
My brain does all of that when I'm asleep?

00:44.401 --> 00:45.154
Yes, it does!

00:45.704 --> 00:48.267
And you do even more things than that when you're asleep.

00:48.403 --> 00:49.611
What else do I do?

00:49.889 --> 00:52.650
Well, your body gets tired during the day,...

00:52.983 --> 00:56.308
...and it needs time to slow down and have a rest,...

00:56.844 --> 00:58.948
...so that you'll be ready for the next day.

00:59.457 --> 01:03.199
Even your breathing slows down and has to rest while you're sleeping.

01:04.207 --> 01:06.679
Oh! But what if I don't feel tired?

01:07.169 --> 01:09.137
Do I still need to go to sleep then?

01:09.481 --> 01:15.234
Oh yes! All people, and especially children, need to go to sleep every night.

01:15.401 --> 01:19.410
And what would happen if I stay there all night tonight?

01:19.727 --> 01:23.848
All night the next night, all night the next night, and all night!

01:25.459 --> 01:30.625
Well, you will get too tired to play, too tired to learn new things, you might get sick,...

01:30.902 --> 01:33.375
...and you would certainly get cross and cranky.

01:33.605 --> 01:37.683
So, even if I'm not tired now, I'd better go to sleep.

01:37.929 --> 01:38.921
Yes, you better.

01:39.358 --> 01:42.377
Then your body will have enough energy for tomorrow,...

01:42.575 --> 01:48.664
...for thinking, playing, laughing, eating, running and growing.

01:48.755 --> 01:49.825
Well, let's go then.

01:50.150 --> 01:51.355
Race you to the bedroom!

01:54.699 --> 01:55.628
Beat you!

01:55.938 --> 01:56.805
Good night!
