00:00.123 --> 00:01.699
Governor Romney, your two-minute closing.

00:01.980 --> 00:03.388
Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President.

00:03.573 --> 00:05.414
And thank you for tuning in this evening.

00:05.803 --> 00:08.171
This is an important election and I'm concerned about America.

00:08.969 --> 00:12.664
I'm concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years.

00:13.321 --> 00:17.845
I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us, as individuals.

00:18.179 --> 00:19.836
It's bigger than our respective parties.

00:20.355 --> 00:21.882
It's an election about the course of America.

00:21.961 --> 00:25.192
What kind of America do you wanna have for yourself and for your children.

00:26.043 --> 00:29.203
And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening,...

00:29.299 --> 00:33.667
...and over the course of this month we're gonna have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate.

00:33.757 --> 00:35.086
We'll talk about those two paths.

00:35.527 --> 00:37.297
But they lead in very different directions.

00:37.839 --> 00:41.715
And it's not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go.

00:41.822 --> 00:42.720
You can look at the record.

00:43.200 --> 00:47.765
There's no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you'll continue to see a middle class squeeze...

00:48.263 --> 00:50.653
...with incomes going down and prices going up.

00:51.156 --> 00:52.299
I'll get incomes up again.

00:52.930 --> 00:54.282
You'll see chronic unemployment.

00:54.380 --> 00:57.992
We've had 43 straight months with unemployment above eight percent.

00:58.469 --> 01:04.529
If I'm president I will create, help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.

01:05.004 --> 01:08.208
The president's reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed.

01:08.859 --> 01:14.245
In my view, that's gonna mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past.

01:14.490 --> 01:15.247
Many will lose it.

01:15.759 --> 01:19.838
You're gonna see health premiums go up by some 2,500 dollars per family.

01:20.311 --> 01:22.087
If I'm elected, we won't have Obamacare.

01:22.428 --> 01:25.582
We'll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state...

01:25.995 --> 01:32.068
...and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we'll focus on getting the cost of healthcare down.

01:32.867 --> 01:38.206
If the president were to be reelected, you're gonna see a 716 billion dollars cut to Medicare.

01:38.759 --> 01:41.308
You'll have four million people who will lose Medicare Advantage.

01:41.642 --> 01:44.887
You'll have hospitals and providers that'll no longer accept Medicare patients.

01:45.357 --> 01:48.721
I'll restore that 716 billion dollars to Medicare.

01:49.149 --> 01:50.721
And finally, military.

01:51.264 --> 01:54.373
The president's reelected, you'll see dramatic cuts to our military.

01:54.706 --> 01:57.494
The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating.

01:57.908 --> 02:00.421
I will not cut our commitment to our military.

02:00.805 --> 02:04.453
I will keep America strong and get America's middle class working again.

02:04.837 --> 02:05.359
Thank you, Jim.

02:05.636 --> 02:06.301
Thank you, Governor.

02:06.427 --> 02:07.382
Thank you, Mr. President.
