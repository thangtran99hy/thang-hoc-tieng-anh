00:00.721 --> 00:04.347
Cat Face was accompanying Box Cat to his children's sports day.

00:05.895 --> 00:07.148
So, what happens here?

00:07.433 --> 00:08.704
Running and the jumping?

00:11.889 --> 00:14.998
When is it finishing time so I can go flip above my chair at them.

00:17.454 --> 00:17.826
What?

00:18.085 --> 00:19.579
Relative's participation?

00:19.743 --> 00:21.444
Well then, that is the job for me.

00:21.708 --> 00:23.503
I thrive on the competition.

00:23.725 --> 00:24.695
Is there a prize?

00:26.062 --> 00:26.850
A chocolate medal?

00:27.038 --> 00:31.397
Well, come on! I will be covering my face in success before the day is through.

00:31.591 --> 00:32.200
Yes.

00:32.464 --> 00:33.279
What is first?

00:34.603 --> 00:35.625
The egg and the spoon.

00:35.826 --> 00:37.865
Well, I am all over this. Yes!

00:38.111 --> 00:40.571
Come on, you ovoid, let's get with the balancing.

00:41.925 --> 00:43.199
That's it, my little egg friend.

00:43.335 --> 00:46.774
Nice and easy with delicious little thing.

00:50.409 --> 00:52.471
What is it with the bad-mouthing there, honestly.

00:52.742 --> 00:53.922
What is up next Box Cat?

00:55.397 --> 00:56.358
A sack race, you say?

00:56.814 --> 00:59.373
Well, that might be a bit more up my street.

00:59.943 --> 01:01.481
Look at this funny little sack.

01:06.457 --> 01:09.338
Look, Box Cat, I am the ghost of sporty past.

01:11.831 --> 01:13.709
No. What? I can't see!

01:17.855 --> 01:19.741
Yes, I have seen your chocolate medal.

01:19.923 --> 01:22.387
I hope you choke on the victory, you sack monkey!

01:23.969 --> 01:25.569
What do you mean take it more seriously?

01:25.770 --> 01:28.524
What does one have to do to get the delicious melty medally treat?

01:29.491 --> 01:30.508
A big surprise?

01:30.806 --> 01:32.935
I'm sure I have a muffin somewhere.

01:33.025 --> 01:36.822
The next race for the relatives will be the three-legged race.

01:36.927 --> 01:41.296
That's the three-legged race over by the starting line thank you.

01:41.421 --> 01:43.514
Right. This one must be mine!

01:43.655 --> 01:44.183
Old lady?

01:44.441 --> 01:45.430
Yes Possums?

01:45.567 --> 01:46.287
Limber up!

01:46.420 --> 01:48.159
This race, we cannot lose.

01:49.793 --> 01:51.144
Quick!

01:52.297 --> 01:53.967
Possums!
