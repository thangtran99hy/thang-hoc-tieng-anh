00:00.457 --> 00:03.092
I think I'd like to talk to myself in the future.

00:04.615 --> 00:06.310
Yes, that's something that I'll do.

00:09.409 --> 00:11.323
I wonder what my past is up to.

00:16.867 --> 00:18.243
Hi, Jeremiah.

00:19.254 --> 00:19.965
Hello, Jeremiah.

00:20.808 --> 00:21.624
You look different.

00:22.640 --> 00:22.987
Do I?

00:23.497 --> 00:23.983
Yes.

00:24.170 --> 00:25.151
I'm 12 years old.

00:25.229 --> 00:25.744
How are you?

00:26.231 --> 00:26.827
How old are you?

00:27.151 --> 00:27.785
26.

00:28.741 --> 00:31.972
Ah, well you look older.

00:33.060 --> 00:33.454
Thanks.

00:33.744 --> 00:34.317
Yes.

00:34.467 --> 00:36.983
It goes to show how much things have changed, yes.

00:37.059 --> 00:37.871
Yes, I suppose so.

00:38.228 --> 00:39.018
Ah, yes.

00:39.199 --> 00:41.313
Well, me of the future?

00:42.293 --> 00:45.419
Well, so how are things?

00:46.933 --> 00:50.783
Things are okay, working at a general store.

00:51.373 --> 00:53.405
Trying out what you expected to be doing at this age...

00:53.531 --> 00:56.679
...but hope that you hadn't really given it much thought at all.

00:58.090 --> 00:59.855
As far as I can see, is Molly still alive?

01:00.731 --> 01:01.632
The dog Molly?

01:04.260 --> 01:08.216
No, she would be about 30 years old if she were still alive.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.325
Well yes, okay.

01:12.943 --> 01:15.202
Yes, and what about Leon?

01:16.639 --> 01:17.345
The cat got him.

01:20.477 --> 01:21.140
Very interesting.

01:21.895 --> 01:28.876
Now, don't you realize that you're kind of messing up time?

01:29.005 --> 01:29.577
Excuse me?

01:29.910 --> 01:30.840
Do you still like Doctor Who?

01:31.513 --> 01:31.863
Yeah.

01:33.784 --> 01:34.915
Yes, good.

01:35.971 --> 01:36.557
I like it.

01:37.471 --> 01:37.739
I know.

01:38.147 --> 01:40.809
Anyway, well I guess that's all I want to ask of you.

01:41.644 --> 01:42.230
Well, thank you.

01:43.789 --> 01:45.054
I see a resemblance.
