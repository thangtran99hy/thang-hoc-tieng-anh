Scare the crap out of people this Halloween...

00:07.849 --> 00:10.327
...by sporting some very realistic fake blood.

00:11.389 --> 00:13.740
You will need a bottle of light corn syrup...

00:14.109 --> 00:15.982
...and red, blue and yellow food coloring.

00:16.377 --> 00:19.185
Optional: cough syrup and chicken livers.

00:19.602 --> 00:23.350
Step one: Pour 16 ounces of light corn syrup into a bowl.

00:23.753 --> 00:26.951
Step two: Add one tablespoon of red food coloring.

00:27.237 --> 00:29.142
Step three: Mix thoroughly.

00:29.441 --> 00:32.305
You can substitute clear cough syrup for the corn syrup.

00:32.711 --> 00:34.593
Step four: To darken the blood,....

00:34.737 --> 00:37.070
...mix in one drop of blue and yellow food coloring.

00:37.434 --> 00:40.227
Need some guts to take the gore level over the top?

00:40.572 --> 00:42.006
Mix in some chicken livers.

00:42.398 --> 00:45.878
Step five: Smear it on your hands and let the bloodbath begin.

00:46.091 --> 00:46.983
You're deranged.

00:47.154 --> 00:47.891
You're a zombie.

00:48.108 --> 00:49.699
You're a psycho killer on the loose.

00:49.973 --> 00:50.994
And if you're not careful,...

00:51.299 --> 00:53.488
...you're going to stain something with that red dye.

00:53.848 --> 00:54.568
Did you know?

00:54.837 --> 00:57.398
Hemophobia is the abnormal fear of blood.
