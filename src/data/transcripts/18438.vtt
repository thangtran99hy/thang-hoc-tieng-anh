When I was growing up, I definitely wanted to be a pilot,...

00:12.273 --> 00:14.617
...and I still actually think about it day-to-day.

00:14.677 --> 00:16.116
I think about taking lessons or something,...

00:16.256 --> 00:18.230
...but I like being on the ground, it's safer.

00:18.571 --> 00:19.539
I created Instagram.

00:20.509 --> 00:24.348
Instagram actually grew out of a company we had started before.

00:24.502 --> 00:25.475
That didn't work out so well.

00:25.591 --> 00:26.659
No one was using it, but...

00:26.812 --> 00:29.190
...the one feature they were using was posting photos.

00:29.263 --> 00:33.359
And they were using apps, other apps to filter their photos,...

00:33.451 --> 00:35.433
...and we realized there was a pattern there.

00:35.497 --> 00:37.613
So we decided to build it all together in one app...

00:38.175 --> 00:39.457
...and see what people would do.

00:39.805 --> 00:41.877
The first day we had over 25,000 sign-ups,...

00:41.949 --> 00:43.187
...so it was really exciting for us.

00:43.331 --> 00:45.369
There isn't so much an "aha" moment as...

00:46.727 --> 00:48.519
...this feeling that if we didn't do this idea,...

00:48.583 --> 00:49.664
...someone else was going to.

00:49.891 --> 00:53.809
And we realized the power of mobile photography and the opportunity at hand...

00:53.872 --> 00:55.438
...and what was to come in the coming year...

00:55.509 --> 00:59.193
...with all the cameras that were being installed on all these phones,...

00:59.933 --> 01:03.387
...and how many people would love taking photos with their smartphones.

01:03.453 --> 01:04.918
That was something we wanted to capture.

01:05.011 --> 01:08.163
I left my job to start a startup because that's what I wanted to do.

01:08.734 --> 01:10.095
It was a long slog actually,...

01:10.165 --> 01:12.601
...we had been working about a year before Instagram came around.

01:12.671 --> 01:15.873
But once we had the idea, it was about eight weeks until we launched...

01:16.001 --> 01:17.953
...and obviously the rest is history now.
