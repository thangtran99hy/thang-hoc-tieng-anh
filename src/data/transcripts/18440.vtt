Hi, I'm Chef Joe and we're here at Serendipity 3...

00:27.140 --> 00:29.294
...making the world's most expensive dessert.

00:29.403 --> 00:30.972
There's a lot of gold involved in this.

00:31.071 --> 00:36.278
Now, we're also going to plate the frozen hot chocolate goblet...

00:36.724 --> 00:40.649
...with 23 karat edible gold.

00:41.373 --> 00:46.071
This dessert in total has about five grams of edible gold.

00:46.435 --> 00:51.239
We found 14 of the rarest, most exotic cocoas.

01:07.551 --> 01:10.480
And then, we have the world's most expensive truffle.

01:11.114 --> 01:14.205
This is $2,600 dollars a pound.

01:14.748 --> 01:20.224
This is 23 karat edible gold from Switzerland.

01:21.907 --> 01:26.997
And here, we have Serendipity's $25,000 dessert.

01:27.513 --> 01:29.713
And of course, you keep the spoon.

01:31.293 --> 01:32.299
I never ate gold before.

01:40.021 --> 01:40.845
It's really good.
