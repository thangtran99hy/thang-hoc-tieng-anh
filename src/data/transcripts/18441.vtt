Today, 1.3 billion people live on less than one dollar and 25 cents a day.

00:07.224 --> 00:08.559
That's one in five of us.

00:10.473 --> 00:12.075
True, we've made a lot of progress,...

00:12.743 --> 00:16.093
...but extreme poverty remains a worldwide scourge...

00:16.463 --> 00:18.895
...that we must work together to eradicate.

00:21.084 --> 00:24.726
So, what will it take for all families to have enough to eat?

00:25.411 --> 00:28.935
What will it take for your children to get a good education?

00:29.519 --> 00:32.891
What will it take for everyone to earn a decent living?

00:33.628 --> 00:34.543
Join the conversation.

00:34.783 --> 00:35.139
Tell us.

00:35.473 --> 00:35.999
Write us.

00:36.363 --> 00:37.797
Send us your comments and ideas...

00:38.160 --> 00:41.457
...on Facebook or on Twitter with a hashtag "what will it take."

00:42.577 --> 00:45.509
For me, I believe it will take all of us working together,...

00:46.039 --> 00:47.734
...so I'm excited to hear your ideas.
