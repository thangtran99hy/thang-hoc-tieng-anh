I live, eat, and breathe sports.

00:03.321 --> 00:06.673
And the new Samsung Smart TV with Smart Interaction, Smart Content...

00:06.861 --> 00:07.905
...is in a league of its own.

00:08.891 --> 00:09.487
Hi, TV.

00:10.995 --> 00:11.757
Smart Hub.

00:12.766 --> 00:13.155
See that?

00:13.799 --> 00:15.837
This TV actually recognizes my voice...

00:15.924 --> 00:17.465
...and pulls up the Samsung Smart Hub,...

00:17.889 --> 00:21.029
...giving me instant access to my favorite apps like ESPN ScoreCenter,...

00:24.047 --> 00:27.054
...so I can keep track of the latest news without missing a second of the action.

00:27.449 --> 00:29.518
It's how you keep track of hoop scores across the country.

00:31.900 --> 00:33.898
Fighting Lemurs won in overtime!

00:35.947 --> 00:36.346
What's a lemur?

00:38.114 --> 00:38.861
Hi, TV!

00:39.571 --> 00:40.241
Smart Hub.

00:41.681 --> 00:42.063
Browser.

00:46.716 --> 00:47.673
It looks like a squirrel.

00:48.464 --> 00:49.105
Intimidating.

00:50.259 --> 00:50.977
Hi, TV!

00:52.365 --> 00:52.930
Smart Hub.

00:54.765 --> 00:56.722
Okay, so the best part about this TV...

00:56.789 --> 00:59.935
...is that it features this incredibly cool voice and gesture control.

01:00.233 --> 01:02.667
It's never been easier to explore a world of content.

01:03.345 --> 01:06.197
