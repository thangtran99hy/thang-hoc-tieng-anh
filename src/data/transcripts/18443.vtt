00:23.955 --> 00:25.130
Are we going to have our prayer?

00:25.546 --> 00:26.747
It's Thanksgiving, you know.

00:27.251 --> 00:29.422
Before we're served, shouldn't we say grace?

00:34.039 --> 00:38.313
Year 1621, the Pilgrims held their first Thanksgiving feast.

00:38.747 --> 00:41.515
They invited the great Indian chief Massasoit,...

00:41.866 --> 00:45.703
...who brought 90 of his brave Indians and a great abundance of food.

00:46.353 --> 00:50.566
Governor William Bradford and Captain Miles Standish were honored guests.

00:51.066 --> 00:53.681
Elder William Brewster, who was a minister,...

00:54.031 --> 00:56.118
...said a prayer that went something like this:..

00:56.829 --> 01:00.954
"We thank God for our homes and our food, and our safety in a new land.

01:01.537 --> 01:06.135
We thank God for the opportunity to create a new world for freedom and justice."

01:06.943 --> 01:07.609
Amen.
