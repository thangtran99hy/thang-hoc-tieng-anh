00:08.935 --> 00:10.675
My daddy was my hero.

00:10.798 --> 00:12.984
He was always there for me when I needed him.

00:13.293 --> 00:15.862
He listened to me and taught me so many things,...

00:16.140 --> 00:17.995
...but most of all, he was fun.

00:18.327 --> 00:20.529
I know that Daddy had an important job.

00:20.881 --> 00:25.204
He was working to change the world so everyone would love wildlife like he did.

00:25.627 --> 00:27.740
He built a hospital to help animals...

00:28.004 --> 00:31.649
...and he bought lots of land to give animals a safe place to live.

00:31.959 --> 00:36.282
He took me and my brother, and my mum with him all the time.

00:36.543 --> 00:41.495
We filmed together, caught crocodiles together, and loved being in the bush together.

00:41.785 --> 00:44.128
I don't want daddy's passion to ever end.

00:44.384 --> 00:47.673
I want to help endangered wildlife just like he did.

00:48.101 --> 00:52.541
I have the best daddy in the whole world and I will miss him every day.

00:52.869 --> 00:55.541
When I see a crocodile, I will always think of him...

00:55.905 --> 01:02.082
...and I know that daddy made this zoo so everyone could come and learn to love all the animals.

01:02.507 --> 01:05.003
Daddy made this place his whole life...

01:05.327 --> 01:07.356
...and now, it's our turn to help daddy.

01:07.662 --> 01:08.313
Thank you.
