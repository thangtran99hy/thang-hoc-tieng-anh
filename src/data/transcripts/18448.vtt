00:11.915 --> 00:12.554
Chairs.

00:15.086 --> 00:17.765
Chairs are made so that people can sit down and take a break.

00:18.979 --> 00:23.814
Anyone can sit on a chair, and if the chair is large enough, they can sit down together...

00:25.613 --> 00:26.563
...and tell jokes,...

00:27.066 --> 00:28.162
...or make up stories...

00:28.893 --> 00:29.585
...or just listen.

00:31.886 --> 00:32.829
Chairs are for people,...

00:34.167 --> 00:36.184
...and that is why chairs are like Facebook.

00:38.909 --> 00:39.669
Doorbells,...

00:40.154 --> 00:40.894
...airplanes,...

00:41.649 --> 00:42.254
...bridges;...

00:42.883 --> 00:44.787
...these are things people use to get together...

00:45.230 --> 00:51.417
...so they can open up and connect about ideas and music and other things that people share.

00:56.275 --> 00:57.085
Dance floors,...

00:57.987 --> 00:58.660
...basketball,...

01:00.335 --> 01:01.324
...a great nation;...

01:02.984 --> 01:07.228
...a great nation is something people build so they can have a place where they belong.

01:10.549 --> 01:11.387
The universe.

01:12.175 --> 01:14.253
It is vast and dark,...

01:14.901 --> 01:16.853
...and makes us wonder if we are alone,...

01:19.878 --> 01:25.852
...so maybe the reason we make all of these things is to remind ourselves that we are not.
