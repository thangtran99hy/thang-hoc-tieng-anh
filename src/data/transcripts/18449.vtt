What is bicycle travel?

00:04.153 --> 00:06.070
Bicycle travel isn't about the bike.

00:07.806 --> 00:09.038
It's about going slowly,...

00:09.462 --> 00:11.749
...exploring your country, and seeing it for the first time.

00:14.217 --> 00:16.819
It's about doing something you didn't think you could do before.

00:20.345 --> 00:22.627
It's about riding to some place you've never been.

00:24.275 --> 00:26.423
It's about slowly climbing a mountain,...

00:27.896 --> 00:29.397
...then flying down the other side.

00:31.899 --> 00:33.669
It's about traveling with friends...

00:34.995 --> 00:36.333
...and making new ones.

00:42.081 --> 00:43.753
It's about roadside fruit stands...

00:44.626 --> 00:46.612
...or finding the best meal you've ever had...

00:47.911 --> 00:49.061
...then getting seconds.

00:50.489 --> 00:52.891
It's about getting lost to find yourself.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.749
But most of all, bicycle travel is about people,...

01:01.599 --> 01:05.125
...swapping stories with other travelers and laughing with the locals.

01:06.158 --> 01:08.539
Because when you travel on a bike, you can't help but smile...

01:09.110 --> 01:10.835
...and people can't help but smile back.

01:12.345 --> 01:13.275
Travel by bike.

01:13.618 --> 01:14.242
 Live more.
