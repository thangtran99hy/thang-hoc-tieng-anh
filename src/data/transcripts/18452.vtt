To build rapport with your audience is a very, very important part of giving a good presentation or speech.

00:11.147 --> 00:13.440
That is, first of all, to the research you do.

00:13.767 --> 00:14.877
So you know the audience,...

00:14.973 --> 00:16.369
...you know what's important to them.

00:16.985 --> 00:20.483
Second, it's about what you say in the first two or three minutes.

00:20.807 --> 00:25.275
Those little things that you say that show that you care about the audience,...

00:25.407 --> 00:26.809
...you understand their issues,...

00:27.069 --> 00:29.614
...and you're gonna help them over the next few minutes.
