00:02.043 --> 00:03.169
We had no competition.

00:03.664 --> 00:07.294
Hooters had no competition back in 1983 when it was developed.

00:07.377 --> 00:09.859
We were the first of our kind.

00:11.435 --> 00:15.695
Casual dining really was just, sort of, getting started back then,...

00:15.771 --> 00:19.203
...and there was nothing in the sports theme area that we were sort of in.

00:19.515 --> 00:23.062
I mean, you had mom and pops at their own restaurants and everything,...

00:23.125 --> 00:26.226
...but it didn't have the sex appeal,...

00:26.506 --> 00:27.895
...it didn't have the cold beer.

00:27.963 --> 00:31.282
There just wasn't a lot of options for people to choose from.

00:32.267 --> 00:34.448
And it does, sort of, what's held true today.

00:34.528 --> 00:35.982
We've got a lot more competition.

00:36.055 --> 00:38.907
But it, sort of, was unique to people's taste.

00:38.977 --> 00:40.008
And I think they relate well.

00:40.241 --> 00:43.973
They have really enjoyed it because we're around, going on 30 years sort of.

00:45.170 --> 00:48.575
Right now, if you're gonna start a new business, be very prepared.

00:49.923 --> 00:50.905
Be very patient.

00:51.702 --> 00:55.242
And treat whatever customers you start out with very well...

00:55.791 --> 00:59.924
...because hopefully, you'll have those customers when you're 5 years, 10 years, 15 years.

01:00.005 --> 01:05.741
So, just be true to yourself and take care of the first customers you get...

01:05.946 --> 01:07.309
...because hopefully they'll stay around with you.

01:07.757 --> 01:08.370
Be patient.
