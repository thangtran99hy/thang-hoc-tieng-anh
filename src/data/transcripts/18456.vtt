WEBVTT

00:00.079 --> 00:01.624
And now we are gonna play Celebrity.

00:02.017 --> 00:03.926
And we have 30 seconds on the clock.

00:04.446 --> 00:04.935
That's it?

00:05.524 --> 00:05.943
30 seconds.

00:05.999 --> 00:06.431
I can do it.

00:06.501 --> 00:08.750
You have to guess really fast so you'll go first.

00:09.091 --> 00:09.295
Alright.

00:09.423 --> 00:09.842
You'll pick it up.

00:09.917 --> 00:13.773
And then when I say start the clock and then I'll start giving you clues...

00:13.839 --> 00:16.017
...and you have to guess who I'm telling you and then I'll be next.

00:16.143 --> 00:16.463
Okay?

00:16.564 --> 00:16.873
Yes.

00:16.985 --> 00:17.342
Alright.

00:17.489 --> 00:17.873
Are you ready?

00:17.989 --> 00:18.401
Yes, go.

00:19.413 --> 00:20.698
Oh, she's a beautiful actress.

00:20.759 --> 00:22.079
She was in Catwoman.

00:22.151 --> 00:22.579
Halle Berry.

00:22.731 --> 00:23.575
Wow, that's fast.

00:24.159 --> 00:27.801
Oh, he was a judge on American Idol but now he's on X Factor.

00:27.891 --> 00:28.664
I worked with him.

00:28.755 --> 00:29.401
Jennifer Lopez?

00:29.802 --> 00:30.741
No, a guy.

00:32.802 --> 00:34.377
He was on American Idol now he's on X Factor.

00:34.956 --> 00:38.184
He's British, he's very very pompous and he judges everybody harshly.

00:38.885 --> 00:40.425
Oh my god, Dakota Fanning!

00:40.613 --> 00:41.225
No, it's a man.

00:42.030 --> 00:43.573
No, you're not helping me, you're not helping me.

00:43.670 --> 00:44.907
Next, next, next, next, next!

00:45.696 --> 00:46.926
Oh, sexiest man alive.

00:47.026 --> 00:48.780
Oh, Ocean's Eleven, Ocean's...

00:48.909 --> 00:49.690
Jennifer Lopez!

00:52.025 --> 00:53.019
Really, that's it?

00:53.187 --> 00:53.925
That's what you give me?

00:55.825 --> 00:56.831
That's what you gave me?

00:57.498 --> 00:58.493
And you said Jennifer Lopez.

01:00.068 --> 01:00.716
I'm sorry.

01:01.942 --> 01:02.862
That's the clue that you give?

01:02.971 --> 01:04.411
This is not how you play the game.

01:05.368 --> 01:07.267
That's not how you play the game.

01:07.354 --> 01:08.875
That's not how you play the game.

01:08.973 --> 01:10.527
Somebody's a sore loser!

01:12.364 --> 01:12.677
Alright.

01:12.811 --> 01:14.365
It's not how I play it.

01:14.709 --> 01:15.507
You're ready for my turn?

01:15.875 --> 01:16.027
Yes, yes.

01:16.651 --> 01:16.981
Alright.

01:17.839 --> 01:18.841
I just thought you were good at it.

01:19.040 --> 01:20.435
No, I'm actually really good at it.

01:20.493 --> 01:21.968
I'm a little worried about you.

01:22.355 --> 01:23.843
But it's your show so let's go.
