Hi, my name is Matt Cail and on behalf of Expert Village I'm gonna show you how to make a princess costume.

00:07.221 --> 00:12.243
The most challenging part of our princess costume hunt is going to be the dress.

00:12.793 --> 00:14.874
The dress is the centerpiece of your costume...

00:15.108 --> 00:19.449
...and it's also gonna be the most difficult to find just the right dress that's going to work for you.

00:19.753 --> 00:23.203
Now, don't build this up into a wedding, it's not like your wedding dress after all.

00:23.513 --> 00:25.736
But it is still a very important element of your costume.

00:25.808 --> 00:28.446
It will be the one people remember about your princess costume.

00:28.967 --> 00:31.478
So, what can we do to find a good dress?

00:31.729 --> 00:32.877
There are a couple of options.

00:33.031 --> 00:34.689
First off, the longest one.

00:35.151 --> 00:38.149
If you are very talented in terms of clothes making,...

00:38.480 --> 00:42.683
...if you have a lot of time and if you have access to some good fabrics,...

00:42.765 --> 00:44.119
...either fabrics that you already own...

00:44.479 --> 00:49.104
...or through a fabric store nearby to get some good material, you can always make a dress.

00:49.391 --> 00:50.252
People have done this.

00:50.779 --> 00:52.949
They've often turned out into really great costumes.

00:53.015 --> 00:55.419
The people that take them on generally know what they're doing.

00:55.883 --> 00:58.899
But again, this is gonna take a lot of time.

00:59.010 --> 01:04.635
A lot of time, a lot of patience and probably a lot of fittings on whoever's gonna be the princess.

01:05.044 --> 01:08.407
Oddly enough, a lot of people who end up being princesses rarely make their own dresses.

01:08.852 --> 01:13.391
So a more practical idea is as I previously mentioned, consider getting a dress from somewhere.

01:13.643 --> 01:14.713
You can even rent some.

01:15.013 --> 01:18.081
This could be a good option to get something that is very neat looking...

01:18.317 --> 01:20.436
...that you're only gonna really be wearing for one evening.
