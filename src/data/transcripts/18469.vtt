If you grew up anywhere near Winston-Salem, North Carolina...

00:04.614 --> 00:09.934
...then you've known since 1937 how delicious Krispy Kreme donuts are.

00:10.651 --> 00:17.048
Gradually in the 40s and 50s, they expanded from just selling to local restaurants...

00:17.172 --> 00:18.631
...to opening a few stores.

00:19.251 --> 00:24.792
In the 1960s, the company again expanded, a little bit more geographically,...

00:25.569 --> 00:32.313
...then the founder died; and in the 70s the company was bought by Beatrice, the large conglomerate.

00:33.219 --> 00:38.086
In the early 90s, the company was bought back by the managers of Krispy Kreme...

00:38.411 --> 00:41.650
...and taken public; and since then it's been a public company.

00:42.157 --> 00:47.323

...and up should come all of the historical financial data on the company while it's been public.

00:55.625 --> 00:58.325
Krispy Kreme became public with a bang...

00:58.826 --> 01:03.131
...and was quickly the darling of Wall Street and eaters alike.

01:03.673 --> 01:08.326
Since then, they've had a difficult time managing their stores profitably...

01:08.424 --> 01:11.966
...and managing the distribution side of their business profitably.

01:12.539 --> 01:17.029
As a result today with the share price in the dollar and a half range,...

01:17.957 --> 01:19.973
...you'll have to make your own investment decision...

01:20.040 --> 01:24.858
...on whether you'd like to participate in the future growth of Krispy Kreme.

01:25.317 --> 01:26.767
They're delicious no matter what.

01:27.865 --> 01:29.251
May the Kreme be with you.

01:29.699 --> 01:33.128
