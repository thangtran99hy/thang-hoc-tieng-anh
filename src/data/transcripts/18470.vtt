For women and to some degree, men today,...

00:03.178 --> 00:04.619
...there's lots of polls on you.

00:04.766 --> 00:06.217
I don't know that I can be the perfect CEO,...

00:06.285 --> 00:06.898
...the perfect wife,...

00:07.124 --> 00:07.831
...the perfect mother,...

00:07.917 --> 00:09.063
..the perfect hostess,...

00:09.350 --> 00:13.715
...and have my house look fabulous all the time, I mean, that's a lot for one person.

00:14.331 --> 00:18.097
And finally, I sort of gave up the notion that I could be perfect at all those things.

00:18.317 --> 00:20.540
It was a little bit like triage in an emergency room.

00:20.870 --> 00:22.230
What's the most important thing?

00:22.329 --> 00:25.657
I said I'm gonna focus on the children, my husband and my job...

00:26.217 --> 00:27.799
...and everything else is gonna have to go.

00:28.027 --> 00:30.710
You just have to kind of figure out what's most important,...

00:30.781 --> 00:31.691
...what you're good at,...

00:32.029 --> 00:33.551
...what you can let go of.

00:33.957 --> 00:36.528
And I think that's the only way to manage all of this.
