Well, it's Halloween again and tonight our neighborhoods...

00:03.868 --> 00:07.925
...will be full of all kinds of little ghosts, and goblins, and creatures of the night.

00:08.440 --> 00:10.748
But have you ever wondered where those ideas came from?

00:11.221 --> 00:13.141
Like so many of our celebrations,...

00:13.494 --> 00:16.473
...the traditions of Halloween are deeply rooted in our past.

00:16.983 --> 00:18.988
This all got started with the ancient Irish.

00:19.059 --> 00:22.505
They celebrated the end of their pastoral year on October 31st.

00:22.959 --> 00:25.187
They called this festival Samhain.

00:25.646 --> 00:27.212
And they believe that on this night,...

00:27.365 --> 00:30.033
...spirits came from the underworld and roamed the Earth.

00:30.672 --> 00:34.440
When Christianity began to influence Irish tradition around the 6th century,...

00:34.503 --> 00:39.154
...October 31st was made into a harvest festival, celebrating Saint Martin.

00:39.585 --> 00:43.477
And the day after this was called All Saints' Day or All Hallows' Day.

00:43.886 --> 00:47.116
So, the night before was Hallows' Eve or Halloween,...

00:47.427 --> 00:51.351
...a combination of ancient Celtic or Irish lore, and a harvest festival.

00:51.871 --> 00:55.229
I suppose the real symbol of Halloween these days is the jack-o'-lantern.

00:55.502 --> 00:56.987
Its history is also Irish.

00:57.265 --> 00:58.691
You see, there was this guy named Jack...

00:58.759 --> 01:02.227
...and he had a terrible reputation for playing practical jokes on people.

01:02.661 --> 01:06.336
When he died, he went to the underworld and he dared to play a trick on the devil.

01:06.803 --> 01:08.533
The devil got so mad he kicked him out...

01:08.731 --> 01:12.442
...and made him wander over the Earth at night with only the light of a lantern...

01:12.579 --> 01:14.178
...to search for his lost soul.

01:14.544 --> 01:19.118
Some say old Jack only had a pumpkin to carry his light in, hence the name jack-o'-lantern.

01:19.717 --> 01:23.035
Now, we also have Jack to thank for the tradition of trick or treat...

01:23.126 --> 01:24.545
...because he was such a trickster.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.315
Have a safe and happy Halloween.

01:26.531 --> 01:27.449
I'm Allen Smith.
