Hi, my name's David Hartmann.

00:08.651 --> 00:11.449
I work for Walt Disney Entertainment in the art department as art director.

00:11.572 --> 00:15.825
This time of year, we're decorating the Magic Kingdom for fall and for Halloween.

00:16.113 --> 00:17.949
So if you look around on Main Street USA,...

00:18.017 --> 00:19.405
...you'll notice there are lots of pumpkins.

00:19.481 --> 00:21.665
There's actually 182 pumpkins.

00:21.801 --> 00:24.807
This year, we got to redesign all the hand carved pumpkins...

00:24.880 --> 00:26.260
...that you see all over the buildings.

00:26.363 --> 00:29.705
The designs, we got to go crazier; we have different colors, different shapes.

00:30.135 --> 00:32.111
The designs vary from Disney characters...

00:32.280 --> 00:34.586
...to theming in the buildings, theming in the windows.

00:35.041 --> 00:37.437
So, if you're looking for new ideas to design your pumpkins,...

00:37.585 --> 00:40.222
...don't stick to the same old square, rectangles.

00:40.472 --> 00:42.409
Do think something different, do it something exciting.

00:42.515 --> 00:43.307
Do something like I did.

00:43.379 --> 00:44.505
There's a snowman pumpkin.

00:44.608 --> 00:45.836
I did a clown pumpkin,...

00:45.961 --> 00:48.258
...so you can do all kinds of creative and exciting things.

00:48.335 --> 00:50.520
I even have some pumpkins that resemble some of my friends.

00:52.867 --> 00:54.600
Casey's Corner has a hotdog.

00:54.823 --> 00:57.140
Over at the ice cream shop, there is a sundae.

00:57.505 --> 01:01.142
There's even an ice cream cone that's falling off of the cone and laying down on the side.

01:01.373 --> 01:02.654
Growing up in Saint Louis, Missouri....

01:02.972 --> 01:06.305
...and coming here, living my dream of decorating the Magic Kingdom for fall...

01:06.682 --> 01:08.243
...it's one of the most exciting things.

01:08.555 --> 01:10.987
Standing here on Main Street and watching someone walk by...

01:11.359 --> 01:13.217
...and smile as they look at the pumpkin...

01:13.772 --> 01:15.928
...brings me all kinds of excitement and joy...

01:16.261 --> 01:18.081
...and makes me feel like the four-year-old I was...

01:18.168 --> 01:19.477
...when I used to come here as a little kid.

01:20.151 --> 01:21.091
Happy Halloween everybody.
