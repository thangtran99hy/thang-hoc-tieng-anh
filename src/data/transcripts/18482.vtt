Halloween is just a few days away and you're probably trying to nail down the perfect costume.

00:07.761 --> 00:11.395
So we've got some dos and don'ts from Hollywood's hottest celebs.

00:13.182 --> 00:15.773
Katy Perry can look cute in just about anything.

00:16.024 --> 00:19.163
But with a cheesetastic mustache? Not so much.

00:19.559 --> 00:23.925
We give Katy credit for getting the look of Queen frontman Freddie Mercury spot-on,...

00:24.047 --> 00:26.957
...but overall, this costume didn't exactly rock us.

00:27.576 --> 00:30.020
Heidi Klum as Betty Boop? Do!

00:30.481 --> 00:33.469
Heidi Klum as a scary blue Indian goddess? Don't!

00:33.835 --> 00:34.915
Do not!

00:35.645 --> 00:37.304
Couple's costumes are always fun,...

00:37.381 --> 00:38.591
...but they can be tricky.

00:38.913 --> 00:42.711
Rick Fox and Eliza Dushku look badass as undead gangsters.

00:42.913 --> 00:45.826
And we dig on Nick and Mariah as imperfect angels.

00:46.031 --> 00:47.681
It says it right on her glove.

00:48.228 --> 00:52.761
Kelly Osbourne and her then boyfriend Luke Worrall went the silly route as bacon and eggs,...

00:53.271 --> 00:57.839
...but Ice-T and his wife Coco scared us not in a good way with this getup.

00:58.187 --> 00:59.703
What's up with that ball gag?

01:00.036 --> 01:06.047
Finally, check out this twitpic from "Modern Family" star Sofia Vergara and her on-screen son Rico Rodriguez.

01:06.279 --> 01:07.423
Too cute!

01:08.071 --> 01:09.913
So, what are you gonna be for Halloween?

01:10.272 --> 01:12.051
Send us a tweet and let us know.
