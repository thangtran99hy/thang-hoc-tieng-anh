00:01.465 --> 00:03.127
Meet an all-American kid.

00:03.207 --> 00:05.357
Quarterback of his middle school football team.

00:05.941 --> 00:10.193
President of the student council and one of the strongest students in his class.

00:10.654 --> 00:16.777
A 12-year-old with a face arching back to those warriors of the Lakota Sioux past...

00:17.224 --> 00:21.036
...like Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, James Lone Elk.

00:21.939 --> 00:26.126
A boy who has their face and is trying to find their strength.

00:26.996 --> 00:32.001
His name is Robert Looks Twice, his long hair an Indian symbol of honor.

00:33.400 --> 00:38.867
And at the tribal dance, he has mastered the fierce precision to every beat of the drum:...

00:39.217 --> 00:41.999
...the hunter echoing the movements of his prey.

00:45.202 --> 00:49.907
At the dances, Robert wears the highest honor given by the tribal elders:...

00:50.086 --> 00:53.395
...eagle feathers, because they reach toward the sky.

00:56.786 --> 00:59.487
At the competition, he wins prize money...

00:59.644 --> 01:03.419
...which he shares with the grandmother who gave him a home.

01:03.771 --> 01:07.374
It's like, I'm just happy to be with the family that loves me, right now.

01:07.937 --> 01:11.429
And when he gets to the White House, he promises...

01:12.277 --> 01:16.255
...he'll make sure his grandmother Blossom has one of her favorite foods...

01:16.473 --> 01:19.957
...dough cooked in oil, they call it Indian fry bread.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.229
And grandma said she wants a whole floor to herself,...

01:22.879 --> 01:23.857
...smelling like fry bread.
