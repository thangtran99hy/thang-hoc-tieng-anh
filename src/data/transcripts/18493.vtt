00:00.407 --> 00:03.251
Mechanical engineers know about machines.

00:03.815 --> 00:06.395
They design engines, robots and generators.

00:06.773 --> 00:11.161
But they also design everyday items like kitchen appliances and power tools.

00:11.765 --> 00:17.963
Whatever the device, if it has moving parts, mechanical engineers were almost certainly involved with its creation.

00:18.571 --> 00:21.712
That's because this is the broadest of all engineering disciplines.

00:22.425 --> 00:26.905
Some mechanical engineers, for example, do the research needed to create a product.

00:27.335 --> 00:32.481
Others design the product itself, while still others design the machines to make the product.

00:33.035 --> 00:38.159
When an item is highly technical, mechanical engineers may even be involved in selling the product.

00:38.672 --> 00:43.561
You'll need excellent math and science skills, plus the ability to think analytically...

00:43.849 --> 00:45.686
...and to deal with abstract ideas.

00:46.192 --> 00:48.754
A knack for creative problem solving is also helpful.

00:49.632 --> 00:55.903
The work can be demanding but mechanical engineers often get to see their designs turn into new products or machines,...

00:56.270 --> 00:58.504
...which can be very satisfying indeed.
