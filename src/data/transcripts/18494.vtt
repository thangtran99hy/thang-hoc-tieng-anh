00:00.273 --> 00:02.129
We face a very big choice.

00:04.025 --> 00:05.354
What kind of country are we going to be?

00:06.388 --> 00:08.924
What kind of country are we going to give our kids?

00:10.090 --> 00:12.099
President Obama, he had his chance.

00:12.249 --> 00:13.143
He made his choices.

00:14.331 --> 00:19.752
His economic agenda: more spending, more borrowing, higher taxes, a government takeover of health care.

00:21.246 --> 00:21.904
It's not working.

00:23.265 --> 00:24.686
It's failed to create the jobs we need.

00:24.945 --> 00:27.458
23 million Americans are struggling for work today.

00:27.913 --> 00:30.194
15% of Americans are in poverty.

00:31.828 --> 00:33.734
This is not what a real recovery looks like.

00:34.511 --> 00:35.768
You deserve better.

00:36.901 --> 00:39.843
Mitt Romney and I want to earn your support.

00:41.381 --> 00:45.205
We're offering real reforms for a real recovery for every American.

00:45.904 --> 00:54.258
Mitt Romney - his experience, his ideas, his solutions - is uniquely qualified to get this job done.

00:54.800 --> 00:58.993
At a time when we have a jobs crisis in America, wouldn't it be nice to have a job creator in the White House?

01:00.031 --> 01:01.117
The choice is clear:...

01:02.133 --> 01:10.812
...a stagnant economy that promotes more government dependency or a dynamic, growing economy that promotes opportunity and jobs.

01:11.804 --> 01:18.361
Mitt Romney and I will not duck the tough issues and we will not blame others for the next four years.

01:18.459 --> 01:19.567
We will take responsibility.

01:20.073 --> 01:23.837
And we will not try to replace our founding principles.

01:24.660 --> 01:26.633
We will reapply our founding principles.

01:27.383 --> 01:31.423
The choice is clear and the choice rests with you.

01:32.020 --> 01:33.200
And we ask you for your vote.

01:33.917 --> 01:34.216
Thank you.
