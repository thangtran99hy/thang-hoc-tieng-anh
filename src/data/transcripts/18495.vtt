00:00.103 --> 00:06.526
The fact is that we're in a situation where we inherited a god-awful circumstance.

00:08.050 --> 00:09.115
People are in real trouble.

00:09.461 --> 00:14.253
We acted to move to bring relief to the people who need the most help now.

00:15.610 --> 00:20.450
And in the process, we, in case you haven't noticed, we have strong disagreements.

00:20.943 --> 00:27.578
You probably detected my frustration with their attitude about the American people.

00:28.193 --> 00:31.380
My friend says that 30 percent of the American people are takers.

00:32.762 --> 00:37.265
Romney points out 47 percent of the people won't take responsibility.

00:37.376 --> 00:38.750
He's talking about my mother and father.

00:38.843 --> 00:42.272
He's talking about the places I grew up in, my neighbors in Scranton and Claymont.

00:44.367 --> 00:46.836
He's talking about the people that have built this country.

00:47.143 --> 00:50.596
All they're looking for, Martha, all they're looking for is an even shot.

00:51.050 --> 00:53.185
Whenever you give them the shot, they've done it.

00:53.823 --> 00:54.288
They've done it.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.746
Whenever you've leveled the playing field, they've been able to move.

00:56.823 --> 00:58.407
And they want a little bit of peace of mind.

00:58.880 --> 01:03.537
And the president and I are not going to rest until that playing field is leveled.

01:04.124 --> 01:07.295
They, in fact, have a clear shot, and they have peace of mind...

01:07.555 --> 01:10.393
...until they can turn to their kid and say with a degree of confidence,...

01:10.656 --> 01:12.782
"...Honey, it's going to be okay."

01:13.283 --> 01:14.476
It's going to be okay.

01:15.007 --> 01:17.129
That's what this is all about.
