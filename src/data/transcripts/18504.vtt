Nuclear tests must end to help ensure a safer world.

00:04.434 --> 00:08.134
That was the message at United Nations headquarters on Thursday...

00:08.257 --> 00:14.359
...at a special meeting of the General Assembly marking the International Day against Nuclear Tests.

00:14.755 --> 00:16.458
In a video message to the gathering,...

00:16.519 --> 00:20.579
...Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon remembers visiting Semipalatinsk,...

00:20.971 --> 00:25.157
...once one of the world's largest nuclear test sites in Kazakhstan.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.546
I visited the site two years ago.

00:28.453 --> 00:30.866
I learned more about the terrible impact,...

00:31.399 --> 00:36.126
...but also about how people are working together to restore the area...

00:36.509 --> 00:38.455
...and improve the health of the people.

00:39.567 --> 00:43.007
I came away with a feeling of hope for the future.

00:44.183 --> 00:48.387
Nuclear tests are a threat to human health and global stability.

00:49.097 --> 00:52.431
The effects are both harmful and long lasting.

00:53.065 --> 00:56.811
As we mark this International Day against Nuclear Test,...

00:57.012 --> 01:04.541
...let us strengthen our efforts to achieve the widely shared goal of a world free of nuclear weapons.
