00:04.368 --> 00:05.668
Use brown sugar.

00:06.203 --> 00:08.837
Take a little bit of brown sugar, say half teaspoon,...

00:09.473 --> 00:12.767
...and then crushed black pepper, half teaspoon.

00:12.976 --> 00:14.926
Mix it together and you put it in your mouth,...

00:15.507 --> 00:17.239
...and you salivate them very slowly.

00:17.819 --> 00:20.906
Okay, let's see what happens if they have phlegm.

00:21.233 --> 00:24.969
You take turmeric, ground the turmeric, ground the pepper.

00:25.219 --> 00:28.615
Now, you boil milk and you reduce it to half.

00:29.079 --> 00:30.770
It has to be really, really hot...

00:30.913 --> 00:32.472
...and mix these two powders together.

00:32.735 --> 00:35.915
Stir it until it becomes like yellow in color,...

00:36.575 --> 00:39.568
...and take half a cup twice a day.

00:39.975 --> 00:42.231
And that goes to your chest of phlegm.
