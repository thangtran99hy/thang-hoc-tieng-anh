I remember her, not a girl but the girl.

00:06.287 --> 00:09.021
The brains behind the all-time top ten comic book vixens...

00:09.090 --> 00:12.793
...only wish they could conjure a siren the likes of Susan Glenn.

00:15.961 --> 00:20.044
Beneath my feet my own private earthquake registered an eight when Susan Glenn was near.

00:21.361 --> 00:25.239
In her presence all that was beautiful before she arrived turned grotesque,...

00:25.678 --> 00:29.032
...and in her shadow others became goblinesque.

00:30.820 --> 00:34.594
If she approached, Susan Glenn didn't walk - she floated,...

00:34.957 --> 00:38.861
...accompanied by pyrotechnic spectacles that left me feeling a foot taller.

00:40.535 --> 00:43.632
She embodied every desirable quality I'd ever wanted.

00:44.357 --> 00:46.863
In my mind, I was a peasant before a queen...

00:47.561 --> 00:50.747
...and so Susan Glenn and I were never a thing.

00:52.250 --> 00:56.218
If I could do it again, I'd do it differently.
