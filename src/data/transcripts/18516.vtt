Why do cats stare when you're pouring milk?

00:07.295 --> 00:09.457
It's like they know it's only a matter of time.

00:10.749 --> 00:15.754
Time: the only thing between them and opposable thumbs.

00:17.494 --> 00:21.596
Imagine that, cats with thumbs!

00:23.710 --> 00:25.012
And what if they got together?

00:25.438 --> 00:27.797
Gangs of cats with thumbs,...

00:28.194 --> 00:31.536
...an organized army with one thing on their mind:...

00:35.571 --> 00:36.689
Cravendale.

00:37.154 --> 00:39.425
Well, jog on, kitties.
