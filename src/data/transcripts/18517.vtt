Hi Mike, what are you up to?

00:01.747 --> 00:04.843
Oh, just diagramming this accident with my State Farm Pocket Agent app.

00:05.136 --> 00:07.427
You can also get a quote and pay your premium with this thing.

00:07.535 --> 00:08.992
I thought State Farm didn't have all those apps.

00:09.079 --> 00:09.759
Where'd you hear that?

00:09.871 --> 00:10.263
The Internet.

00:10.377 --> 00:11.086
And you believed it?

00:11.275 --> 00:13.356
Yeah. They can't put anything on the Internet that isn't true.

00:13.609 --> 00:14.267
Where'd you hear that?

00:14.883 --> 00:15.425
The Internet.

00:16.435 --> 00:17.835
Oh look, here comes my date.

00:18.257 --> 00:19.105
I met him on the Internet.

00:19.456 --> 00:20.264
He's a French model.

00:22.306 --> 00:23.123
Bonjour!

00:25.521 --> 00:27.365
State Farm: more mobile than ever.

00:27.834 --> 00:28.966
Get to a better state.
