While social networking is a useful tool for communication,...

00:06.162 --> 00:09.519
...allowing people to integrate further with like-minded individuals,...

00:09.997 --> 00:12.765
...occasionally, overuse can lead to an inability...

00:12.831 --> 00:15.054
...to cope with elements of normal life.

00:15.523 --> 00:19.385
Knowing if you are an overuser involves identifying key signs of addiction.

00:19.731 --> 00:21.285
This can vary from person to person,...

00:21.359 --> 00:24.885
...but typically indicates a strong dependence on the social network.

00:25.827 --> 00:28.581
The solution is to wean yourself back into real life slowly...

00:28.861 --> 00:31.596
...as sudden moves can be dangerous.

00:32.111 --> 00:33.549
Once you are back in the real world,...

00:33.658 --> 00:36.776
...genuine face to face networking can take place.

00:37.291 --> 00:40.299
Note : You will have to temper your previously unfiltered opinions.

00:40.635 --> 00:44.794
When visiting someone, writing on their actual wall is not acceptable.

00:45.359 --> 00:48.704
By now, you'll be slowly remembering how normal people operate...

00:48.909 --> 00:53.162
...and remembering that sometimes, actions are more important than opinions.

00:53.862 --> 00:55.610
Once you're socializing in the real world,...

00:55.875 --> 00:57.766
...you can move on to finding that special someone,...

00:58.078 --> 01:00.783
...though do remember: do not insert your credit card...

01:01.021 --> 01:03.385
...in order to convince them to get naked.

01:03.693 --> 01:07.984
By now, you would have successfully spent less time on social networking sites.
