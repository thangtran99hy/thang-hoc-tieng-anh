Like all of you, I was shocked and saddened by the deaths of several young people who were bullied and taunted for being gay,...

00:06.773 --> 00:08.468
...and who ultimately took their own lives.

00:09.219 --> 00:12.081
As a parent of two daughters, it breaks my heart.

00:12.744 --> 00:14.960
It's something that just shouldn't happen in this country.

00:16.164 --> 00:23.858
And we've got to dispel this myth that bullying is just a normal rite of passage; that it's some inevitable part of growing up.

00:24.564 --> 00:25.041
It's not.

00:25.984 --> 00:30.540
We have an obligation to ensure that our schools are safe for all of our kids.

00:31.583 --> 00:38.500
And to every young person out there, you need to know that if you're in trouble, there are caring adults who can help.

00:39.929 --> 00:43.247
I don't know what it's like to be picked on for being gay.

00:43.423 --> 00:47.767
But I do know what it's like to grow up feeling that sometimes you don't belong.

00:48.637 --> 00:49.112
It's tough.

00:50.016 --> 00:55.640
And for a lot of kids, the sense of being alone or apart, I know, can just wear on you.

00:56.213 --> 01:02.345
And when you're teased or bullied, it can seem like somehow you brought it on yourself for being different,...

01:02.452 --> 01:04.657
...or for not fitting in with everybody else.

01:05.339 --> 01:06.516
What I want to say is this.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.197
You are not alone.

01:09.059 --> 01:10.133
You didn't do anything wrong.

01:10.883 --> 01:13.020
You didn't do anything to deserve being bullied.

01:13.738 --> 01:17.406
And there is a whole world waiting for you, filled with possibilities.

01:17.963 --> 01:21.753
There are people out there who love you and care about you just the way you are.

01:22.620 --> 01:29.859
And so, if you ever feel like, because of bullying, because of what people are saying, that you're getting down on yourself;...

01:30.282 --> 01:32.777
...you've got to make sure to reach out to people you trust.

01:33.286 --> 01:39.675
Whether it's your parents, teachers; folks that you know care about you just the way you are,...

01:39.935 --> 01:44.130
...you've got to reach out to them; don't feel like you're in this by yourself.

01:45.187 --> 01:47.837
The other thing you need to know is, things will get better.

01:48.409 --> 01:54.471
And more than that, with time you're going to see that your differences are a source of pride and a source of strength.

01:55.250 --> 02:00.091
You'll look back on the struggles you've faced with compassion and wisdom.

02:00.377 --> 02:06.543
And that's not just going to serve you, but it will help you get involved and make this country a better place.

02:07.743 --> 02:10.971
It will mean that you'll be more likely to help fight discrimination...

02:11.565 --> 02:16.316
...not just against LGBT Americans, but discrimination in all its forms.

02:17.108 --> 02:23.711
It means you'll be more likely to understand personally and deeply why it's so important that as adults, we set an example...

02:24.045 --> 02:27.102
......in our own lives and that we treat everybody with respect,...

02:27.649 --> 02:32.150
...that we are able to see the world through other people's eyes and stand in their shoes,...

02:32.736 --> 02:35.504
...that we never lose sight of what binds us together.

02:36.524 --> 02:43.400
As a nation, we're founded on the belief that all of us are equal and each of us deserves the freedom to pursue our own version of happiness;...

02:43.761 --> 02:51.287
...to make the most of our talents, to speak our minds, to not fit in; most of all, to be true to ourselves.

02:52.175 --> 02:53.889
That's the freedom that enriches all of us.

02:54.009 --> 02:55.231
That's what America is all about.

02:56.217 --> 02:58.077
And every day, it gets better.
