00:03.214 --> 00:07.202
The sun has set not long ago.

00:07.289 --> 00:11.225
Now everybody goes below...

00:11.649 --> 00:15.193
...to take a bath in one big tub...

00:15.510 --> 00:19.327
...with soap all over, scrub, scrub, scrub!

00:19.635 --> 00:23.052
They hang their towels on the wall,...

00:23.241 --> 00:27.057
...and find pajamas, big and small,...

00:27.136 --> 00:30.881
...with some on top and some beneath,...

00:31.203 --> 00:35.175
...they brush and brush and brush their teeth.

00:35.386 --> 00:39.139
And when the moon is on the rise,...

00:39.596 --> 00:43.194
...they all go up to exercise!

00:43.539 --> 00:46.989
And down once more, but not so fast,...

00:47.383 --> 00:51.108
...they're on their way to bed at last.

00:51.556 --> 00:53.049
The day is done.

00:53.528 --> 00:55.031
They say good night,...

00:55.394 --> 00:58.969
...and somebody turns off the light.

00:59.454 --> 01:01.034
The moon is high.

01:01.361 --> 01:02.774
The sea is deep.

01:03.391 --> 01:06.999
They rock and rock and rock to sleep.
