00:00.035 --> 00:02.859
We have to figure out a way I think as educators...

00:02.959 --> 00:05.115
...to harness the power of these technologies,...

00:05.531 --> 00:07.843
...which children have a natural attraction to.

00:08.294 --> 00:11.733
Figure out a way that they can be used as learning devices,...

00:11.831 --> 00:13.769
...which is really what they are after all.

00:14.342 --> 00:17.610
And we're working at Sesame Street...

00:17.709 --> 00:21.617
...to try to use all kinds of technologies including mobile phones...

00:21.950 --> 00:23.027
...to teach the alphabet...

00:23.451 --> 00:28.685
...and maybe in developing countries even leapfrog over a lot of the inadequacies in formal schooling.

00:29.093 --> 00:31.110
Well, the role of the teacher will inevitably change...

00:31.195 --> 00:32.958
...maybe a little more of a mentor,...

00:33.309 --> 00:34.563
...a little more of a coach.

00:35.705 --> 00:40.747
A guide, someone who can edit the endless amounts of information...

00:40.824 --> 00:43.037
...that is available now to all of us on the web.

00:43.567 --> 00:49.443
Figure out a way to point children towards answers without giving them the answers...

00:49.531 --> 00:52.437
...so that they can really build problem solving skills...

00:52.513 --> 00:56.475
...which is a huge part I think of any successful education program in the world.

00:56.895 --> 01:03.107
So technology and the teachers will find a different way I think to interact with each other.
