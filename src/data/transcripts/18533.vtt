00:07.283 --> 00:08.951
It gets all the nations together...

00:09.065 --> 00:12.594
..and they make decisions, hopefully good decisions.

00:12.693 --> 00:15.517
One of the first peacekeeping missions were in my country.

00:16.375 --> 00:20.529
So for me, the UN is not a distant kind of organization.

00:20.686 --> 00:23.647
I think it is now perceived as null and void...

00:24.315 --> 00:29.281
...because in essence, I think the US is making all the vital decisions.

00:32.539 --> 00:34.512
On a rudimentary basis, yes...

00:34.736 --> 00:40.677
But maybe their strategy would be to refocus what their goals and objectives are.

00:40.857 --> 00:44.239
Absolutely, at this point I think the world is globalizing more and more...

00:44.482 --> 00:50.164
...and we need to kind of pull together to govern the world more as one unified whole.

00:50.356 --> 00:52.838
How the UN is structured right now, it's ineffective...

00:52.935 --> 00:59.095
...but I think that it's important that countries continue to create and enhance dialogues...

00:59.175 --> 01:00.835
...so that there is effective interplay.

01:01.087 --> 01:02.785
The world needs the UN more than ever.

01:03.037 --> 01:07.962
And it's a question of how you define who is part of the UN.

01:10.711 --> 01:14.837
It's good for humanitarian aid...

01:14.907 --> 01:18.873
...and going in there but even their peacekeeping troops don't do anything.

01:19.337 --> 01:20.933
They can't keep the peace.

01:21.081 --> 01:21.935
Not effective.

01:22.436 --> 01:26.598
Ultimately, it has not been as effective as it's initially set up to be.

01:27.090 --> 01:30.015
You know it's really, in my view, seen as more as an impotent body.

01:30.277 --> 01:37.589
It is effective but it needs to take more, it needs to be more noticed.
