Governor Romney: Pay Equity for Women

00:03.103 --> 00:03.453
Thank you.

00:03.653 --> 00:07.333
And important topic and one which I learned a great deal about,...

00:07.908 --> 00:10.320
...particularly as I was serving as governor of my state...

00:11.042 --> 00:13.953
...because I had the chance to pull together a Cabinet...

00:14.557 --> 00:17.526
...and all the applicants seemed to be men.

00:18.661 --> 00:19.790
And I went to my staff and I said,...

00:19.857 --> 00:21.908
..."How come all the people for these jobs are all men?"

00:21.987 --> 00:24.013
They said, "Well, these are the people that have the qualifications."

00:24.093 --> 00:28.346
And I said, "Well, gosh, can't we find some women that are also qualified?"

00:29.741 --> 00:32.915
And so we took a concerted effort to go out and find women...

00:33.629 --> 00:36.956
...who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our Cabinet.

00:37.485 --> 00:39.159
I went to a number of women's groups and said,...

00:39.248 --> 00:40.197
..."Can you help us find folks?"...

00:40.257 --> 00:42.835
...and they brought us whole binders full of women.

00:43.345 --> 00:47.363
I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff,...

00:47.986 --> 00:52.313
...that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states...

00:53.001 --> 00:56.141
....and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions...

00:56.233 --> 00:57.281
...than any other state in America.
