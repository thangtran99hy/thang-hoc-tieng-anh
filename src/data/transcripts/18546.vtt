What do you believe is the biggest misperception that the American people have about you as a man and a candidate?

00:09.566 --> 00:16.803
Using specific examples, can you take this opportunity to debunk that misperception and set us straight?

00:18.429 --> 00:21.232
Thank you, and that's an opportunity for me, and I appreciate it.

00:22.441 --> 00:27.862
In the nature of a campaign, it seems that some campaigns are focused on attacking a person...

00:27.946 --> 00:31.335
...rather than prescribing their own future and the things they'd like to do.

00:31.979 --> 00:32.845
In the course of that,...

00:32.915 --> 00:38.071
...I think the president's campaign has tried to characterize me as someone who's very different than who I am.

00:39.010 --> 00:40.987
I care about 100 percent of the American people.

00:41.689 --> 00:44.660
I want 100 percent of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future.

00:45.399 --> 00:46.696
I care about our kids.

00:47.623 --> 00:52.088
I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future for America again.

00:52.545 --> 00:55.027
I spent my life in the private sector, not in government.

00:55.809 --> 00:59.745
I'm a guy who wants to help, with the experience I have, the American people.

01:01.762 --> 01:04.279
My passion probably flows from the fact that I believe in God.

01:05.220 --> 01:07.007
And I believe we're all children of the same God.

01:07.988 --> 01:10.406
I believe we have a responsibility to care for one another.

01:11.392 --> 01:13.259
I served as a missionary for my church.

01:13.829 --> 01:16.828
I served as a pastor in my congregation for about ten years.

01:17.295 --> 01:20.347
I've sat across the table from people who were out of work...

01:20.936 --> 01:24.137
...and worked with them to try and find new work or to help them through tough times.

01:24.719 --> 01:27.989
I went to the Olympics when they were in trouble to try and get them on track.

01:28.443 --> 01:32.744
And as governor of my state, I was able to get 100 percent of my people insured,...

01:33.165 --> 01:36.201
...all my kids, about 98 percent of the adults.

01:36.916 --> 01:40.109
I was able also to get our schools ranked number one in the nation,...

01:40.205 --> 01:43.033
...so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright opportunity for a future.

01:43.975 --> 01:47.650
I understand that I can get this country on track again.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.237
We don't have to settle for what we're going through.

01:49.849 --> 01:52.071
We don't have to settle for gasoline at four bucks.

01:52.513 --> 01:56.665
We don't have to settle for unemployment at a chronically high level.

01:57.061 --> 02:00.247
We don't have to settle for 47 million people on food stamps.

02:00.831 --> 02:04.565
We don't have to settle for 50 percent of kids coming out of college not able to get work.

02:05.256 --> 02:09.375
We don't have to settle for 23 million people struggling to find a good job.

02:10.001 --> 02:12.596
If I become president, I'll get America working again.

02:13.145 --> 02:15.102
I will get us on track to a balanced budget.

02:15.465 --> 02:16.313
The president hasn't.

02:16.431 --> 02:17.038
I will.

02:17.456 --> 02:22.978
I'll make sure we can reform Medicare and Social Security to preserve them for coming generations.

02:23.045 --> 02:24.129
The president said he would.

02:24.360 --> 02:24.971
He didn't.

02:25.174 --> 02:25.546
Governor.

02:25.635 --> 02:26.631
I'll get our incomes up.

02:26.800 --> 02:29.008
And by the way, I've done these things.

02:29.343 --> 02:31.642
I served as governor and showed I could get them done.
