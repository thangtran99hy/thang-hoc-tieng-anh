00:00.751 --> 00:03.079
I think a lot of this campaign,...

00:03.438 --> 00:07.989
...maybe over the last four years, has been devoted to this notion that I think government creates jobs,...

00:08.831 --> 00:10.200
...that that somehow is the answer.

00:10.540 --> 00:11.585
That's not what I believe.

00:12.767 --> 00:17.401
I believe that the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of prosperity the world has ever known.

00:18.621 --> 00:25.477
I believe in self-reliance and individual initiative and risk takers being rewarded.

00:26.907 --> 00:29.297
But I also believe that everybody should have a fair shot...

00:30.672 --> 00:31.929
...and everybody should do their fair share...

00:32.065 --> 00:34.463
...and everybody should play by the same rules,...

00:35.587 --> 00:37.493
...because that's how our economy has grown.

00:38.177 --> 00:40.576
That's how we built the world's greatest middle class.

00:42.970 --> 00:45.448
And that is part of what's at stake in this election.

00:45.529 --> 00:49.334
There's a fundamentally different vision about how we move our country forward.

00:50.887 --> 00:52.493
I believe Governor Romney is a good man,...

00:54.181 --> 00:56.558
...loves his family, cares about his faith.

00:58.400 --> 01:02.175
But I also believe that when he said, behind closed doors,...

01:02.247 --> 01:10.190
...that 47 percent of the country considered themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility,...

01:11.521 --> 01:12.845
...think about who he was talking about,...

01:14.224 --> 01:16.599
...folks on Social Security who've worked all their lives,..

01:18.484 --> 01:20.825
...veterans who sacrificed for this country,...

01:22.403 --> 01:28.697
...students who are out there trying to hopefully advance their own dreams, but also this country's dreams,...

01:29.465 --> 01:32.119
...soldiers who are overseas fighting for us right now,...

01:33.500 --> 01:35.325
...people who are working hard every day,...

01:35.879 --> 01:39.477
...paying payroll tax, gas taxes, but don't make enough income.

01:40.391 --> 01:41.722
And I wanna fight for them.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.815
That's what I've been doing for the last four years...

01:43.907 --> 01:47.761
...because if they succeed, I believe the country succeeds.

01:48.260 --> 01:53.141
When my grandfather fought in World War II and he came back and he got a G.I. Bill...

01:53.211 --> 01:54.395
...and that allowed him to go to college,...

01:55.315 --> 01:56.209
...that wasn't a handout.

01:57.150 --> 01:59.697
That was something that advanced the entire country.

01:59.853 --> 02:03.965
And I wanna make sure that the next generation has those same opportunities.

02:04.195 --> 02:05.459
That's why I'm asking for your vote.

02:05.537 --> 02:07.222
And that's why I'm asking for another four years.
