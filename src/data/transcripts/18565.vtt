We all know that words change their meaning according to the context they're used in.

00:09.126 --> 00:12.249
This change in meaning can sometimes be quite significant.

00:13.019 --> 00:18.017
The word pitch, for example, can be used to refer to the field area available...

00:18.116 --> 00:19.401
...for playing football or cricket.

00:20.031 --> 00:24.946
However, in phonology, it is the range of voice level available through the vocal cords.

00:25.792 --> 00:28.963
As language users, it is important for us to understand...

00:29.260 --> 00:32.284
...how words are used differently in different situations.

00:33.355 --> 00:37.442
The understanding that language usage adapts to the context and environment...

00:37.741 --> 00:41.095
....leads us to the broader definition of the word language,...

00:41.333 --> 00:42.819
....which we linguists prefer.

00:43.850 --> 00:48.327
This definition is not restricted to the 6,000 distinct communication systems...

00:48.393 --> 00:52.101
....including key languages such as English, Chinese and French.

00:52.641 --> 00:56.842
It includes any form of speech within these categories, including dialect.

00:57.549 --> 01:02.775
Dialect, by the way, is the variety of a language used in a particular part of a country.
