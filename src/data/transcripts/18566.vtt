00:04.198 --> 00:06.651
No animals can communicate through a medium,...

00:06.715 --> 00:09.049
...which includes all the features of human language,...

00:09.266 --> 00:10.671
...but all humans can.

00:11.385 --> 00:14.239
Human activity is complex and varied,...

00:14.576 --> 00:17.259
...and so is the study of language and linguistics.

00:17.805 --> 00:20.538
I shall now return to the different branches of linguistics,...

00:20.605 --> 00:22.582
....which you will encounter in this faculty.

00:23.417 --> 00:27.313
These range from morphology and syntax to the study of areas...

00:27.387 --> 00:30.451
...such as psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics.

00:31.136 --> 00:33.691
These areas may seem unfamiliar to you now,...

00:34.039 --> 00:37.389
...but if you use your knowledge of affixes and combining forms,...

00:37.672 --> 00:40.567
...then you can work out the meanings of some of these branches.

00:40.977 --> 00:45.301
For example, psycholinguistics is concerned with psychology...

00:45.555 --> 00:47.323
...and how language affects learning.

00:48.105 --> 00:52.410
Sociolinguistics involves society and people's attitudes...

00:52.487 --> 00:55.094
...to standard and nonstandard forms of language.

00:55.850 --> 00:58.961
The ology in morphology brings us back...

00:59.052 --> 01:02.225
...to the concept of linguistics as a scientific study.

01:03.003 --> 01:07.192
In this case, morphology refers to the study of word structure,...

01:07.496 --> 01:11.177
...in other words, how different elements or morphemes,...

01:11.447 --> 01:13.807
...combine to form what we call words.

01:14.368 --> 01:17.253
Oh and the 'syn' in syntax means 'together.'

01:17.629 --> 01:23.061
So, syntax means the way words are combined or arranged in sentences.
