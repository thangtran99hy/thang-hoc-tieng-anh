00:00.450 --> 00:01.056
Here we go.

00:02.089 --> 00:04.675
One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish.

00:04.751 --> 00:07.524
Black fish, blue fish, old fish, new fish.

00:07.599 --> 00:09.635
This one has a little star.

00:09.727 --> 00:11.725
And this one has a little car.

00:11.837 --> 00:12.326
Say!

00:12.569 --> 00:15.302
What a lot of little fish there are, yeah.

00:16.547 --> 00:18.707
Some are red and some are blue.

00:18.789 --> 00:20.958
Some are old and some are new.

00:21.070 --> 00:23.332
Some are sad and some are glad.

00:23.447 --> 00:25.772
And some are very, very bad.

00:25.905 --> 00:28.113
Why are they sad and glad and bad?

00:28.224 --> 00:29.028
I do not know.

00:29.322 --> 00:30.777
Go ask your dad.

00:35.995 --> 00:38.065
Some are thin and some are fat.

00:38.187 --> 00:40.377
The fat one has a yellow hat.

00:40.468 --> 00:42.554
From there to here, and here to there,...

00:42.624 --> 00:44.243
...funny things are everywhere.

00:44.426 --> 00:46.063
Here are some who like to run.

00:46.166 --> 00:48.449
They run for fun in the hot, hot sun.

00:48.551 --> 00:49.500
Oh me! Oh my!

00:49.604 --> 00:50.501
Oh me! Oh my!

00:50.613 --> 00:52.644
What a lot of funny things go by.

00:54.078 --> 00:54.546
Yeah.

00:55.794 --> 00:57.915
Some have two feet and some have four.

00:58.106 --> 01:00.383
Some have six feet and some have more.

01:00.500 --> 01:01.623
Where do they come from?

01:01.734 --> 01:02.679
I can't say.

01:02.813 --> 01:05.225
But I bet they have come a long, long way.

01:09.365 --> 01:10.235
We see them come.

01:10.430 --> 01:11.457
We see them go.

01:11.546 --> 01:13.779
Some are fast and some are slow.

01:13.890 --> 01:15.977
Some are high and some are low.

01:16.133 --> 01:17.837
Not one of them is like another.

01:17.923 --> 01:19.057
Don't ask us why.

01:19.161 --> 01:20.846
Go ask your mother.
