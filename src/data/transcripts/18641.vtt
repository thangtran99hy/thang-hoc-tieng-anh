00:05.171 --> 00:06.496
Things started looking up.

00:06.881 --> 00:11.221
One of the first orders of business was to build a peace with the local Indians.

00:11.680 --> 00:13.969
The Indians were suspicious of the Pilgrims...

00:14.068 --> 00:18.006
...because there were previous run-ins with Englishmen that ended badly.

00:18.343 --> 00:20.599
Some Indians have been kidnapped and killed,...

00:20.917 --> 00:25.525
...and diseases brought by visiting English had even wiped out entire villages.

00:26.215 --> 00:29.322
But to their credit, the Pilgrims were wise in diplomacy...

00:29.462 --> 00:31.457
...and had a high view of the Indians.

00:31.581 --> 00:34.179
They sought long-term peace with their neighbors,...

00:34.597 --> 00:38.005
...and with the help of Squanto, an English-speaking Indian,...

00:38.349 --> 00:42.422
...they reached an accord with Wampanoag chief Massasoit,...

00:42.904 --> 00:46.284
...an agreement honored by both sides for their lifetimes.

00:46.875 --> 00:51.810
That summer was filled with building homes, planting crops, hunting, and fishing.

00:52.267 --> 00:55.846
Squanto and other Indians were helpful in teaching the Pilgrims...

00:55.965 --> 00:58.063
...the skills that they needed to survive.

00:58.751 --> 01:03.471
The first fall delivered a super abundance of every kind of food.

01:04.129 --> 01:07.815
It had been an amazing year, and finally, things were looking up,...

01:08.329 --> 01:10.829
...and, well, it was time to party.
