Did you know Thanksgiving and many of its modern traditions can be traced back almost 400 years?

00:07.587 --> 00:10.386
In search of religious freedom from the Church of England,...

00:10.701 --> 00:18.011
...a group of English settlers known as the Pilgrims washed up on the shore of Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1620.

00:18.906 --> 00:21.143
Unprepared for the harsh New England winter,...

00:21.463 --> 00:25.917
...tragedy struck as crops died and many of the settlers did not survive.

00:26.919 --> 00:32.878
What saved the Pilgrims was a Native American man from the Wampanoag tribe by the name of Squanto.

00:33.772 --> 00:39.405
Squanto befriended the settlers and taught them how to grow corn, squash and beans:...

00:40.339 --> 00:42.157
...crops that could survive in the climate.

00:43.451 --> 00:46.860
By the fall of 1621, the crops were thriving.

00:47.130 --> 00:50.539
It was truly a miracle and one worth celebrating.

00:51.535 --> 00:57.187
So the settlers asked the local Native Americans to join them in a harvest home celebration,...

00:57.451 --> 00:59.154
...a custom they brought from Europe.

01:00.239 --> 01:05.259
The two cultures joined in a new world harvest home that lasted for three days...

01:05.436 --> 01:09.899
...and included games, songs, and of course, a memorable feast.

01:11.094 --> 01:14.507
We commonly refer to this feast as the first Thanksgiving.

01:14.898 --> 01:19.439
But many things, including the food, were quite different from our celebrations today.

01:20.959 --> 01:23.779
While the settlers may have feasted on wild turkey,...

01:24.067 --> 01:29.129
...it's likely they also dined on goose, rabbit, codfish, and lobster.
