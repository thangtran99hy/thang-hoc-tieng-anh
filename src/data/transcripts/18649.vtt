00:01.125 --> 00:02.526
Good evening, my fellow citizens.

00:03.879 --> 00:13.363
This government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military buildup on the island of Cuba.

00:14.348 --> 00:19.040
Within the past week, unmistakable evidence has established the fact...

00:19.937 --> 00:26.663
...that a series of offensive missile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island.

00:27.754 --> 00:36.021
The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western hemisphere.

00:37.034 --> 00:42.660
Only last Thursday, as evidence of this rapid offensive buildup was already in my hand,...

00:43.547 --> 00:50.264
...Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko told me in my office that he was instructed to make it clear once again,...

00:50.957 --> 00:55.882
...as he said his government had already done, that Soviet assistance to Cuba, and I quote,...

00:56.665 --> 01:02.439
"...pursued solely the purpose of contributing to the defense capabilities of Cuba,..."

01:03.232 --> 01:12.723
...that, and I quote him, "Training by Soviet specialists of Cuban nationals in handling defensive armaments was by no means offensive,..."

01:13.596 --> 01:22.823
"...and if it were otherwise," Mr. Gromyko went on, "the Soviet government would never become involved in rendering such assistance."

01:23.529 --> 01:25.459
That statement also was false.

01:26.636 --> 01:31.853
Acting, therefore, in the defense of our own security and of the entire Western hemisphere,...

01:33.021 --> 01:39.178
...and under the authority entrusted to me by the constitution as endorsed by the resolution of the congress,...

01:40.107 --> 01:43.893
...I have directed that the following initial steps be taken immediately.

01:44.830 --> 01:53.142
To halt this offensive buildup, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated.

01:54.021 --> 02:03.027
All ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation or port will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back.

02:03.915 --> 02:12.190
It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western hemisphere...

02:12.907 --> 02:21.435
...as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union.

02:22.437 --> 02:30.665
I call upon Chairman Khrushchev to halt and eliminate this clandestine, reckless, and provocative threat to world peace...

02:31.465 --> 02:33.597
...and the stable relations between our two nations.

02:34.595 --> 02:40.609
I call upon him further to abandon this course of world domination, and to join in a historic effort...

02:41.303 --> 02:45.583
...to end the perilous arms race and to transform the history of man.

02:46.420 --> 02:50.972
Our goal is not the victory of might, but the vindication of right;...

02:51.810 --> 02:56.279
...not peace at the expense of freedom, but both peace and freedom...

02:57.050 --> 03:00.435
...here in this hemisphere, and we hope, around the world.

03:01.509 --> 03:04.210
God willing, that goal will be achieved.
