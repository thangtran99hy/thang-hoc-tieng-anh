There's something that I've heard you say.

00:02.418 --> 00:08.547
While others have said this could be the century for India and the century for China,...

00:08.675 --> 00:10.829
...you have said this is the century, not the year,...

00:10.903 --> 00:12.311
...the century for the woman.

00:13.780 --> 00:14.852
Why have you said that,...

00:14.923 --> 00:18.048
...and what is your belief in making that a reality?

00:18.903 --> 00:22.595
I said it because of the huge amount of potential.

00:23.765 --> 00:30.751
Just simple statistics that are written not by one organization, necessarily the World Bank or IMF,...

00:30.837 --> 00:35.669
...but many different organizations look at, say, if we can empower more women,...

00:36.139 --> 00:37.911
...especially in the emerging world,...

00:38.096 --> 00:39.783
...but also in the developed world,...

00:41.193 --> 00:43.547
...that there is a huge increase in productivity,...

00:43.934 --> 00:46.607
...25 to 40 percent increase in productivity.

00:47.370 --> 00:54.419
There will be a jump in GDP in emerging markets by 14 percent between now and 2020...

00:54.617 --> 00:58.409
...if we can have much better equality, gender equality.

00:58.657 --> 01:05.817
So, those are the kind of reasons why I say that this is not the century of the BRICS...

01:06.121 --> 01:07.348
...but the century of women.
