You're obviously famous for having a very good voice.

00:08.453 --> 00:09.939
But Morgan Freeman is in this.

00:10.055 --> 00:11.545
Now that's the voice of God, baby.

00:12.603 --> 00:14.212
In this changing world.

00:14.417 --> 00:15.918
In this changing world.

00:15.988 --> 00:17.434
In this changing world.

00:17.493 --> 00:20.482
It's harder than ever to find something extraordinary.

00:20.576 --> 00:21.619
My voice ain't like that.

00:21.693 --> 00:22.579
One thing I can tell you.

00:22.653 --> 00:28.071
If you're looking to improve the sound of your voice, yawn a lot.

00:29.762 --> 00:30.439
Yawn a lot?

00:30.610 --> 00:31.863
Yawn a lot.

00:32.929 --> 00:33.236
Why?

00:33.339 --> 00:33.844
Tell me why.

00:34.255 --> 00:37.247
It relaxes your throat muscles.

00:37.326 --> 00:39.031
It relaxes your vocal cords.

00:39.471 --> 00:42.660
And as soon as they relax, the tone drops.

00:44.161 --> 00:46.432
The lower your voice is, the better your sound.

00:47.102 --> 00:50.824
So if I yawned a lot, I might start sounding like Morgan Freeman.

00:50.907 --> 00:52.964
No, but you would certainly get a deeper voice.

00:53.681 --> 00:57.435
But every once in a while, a symbol of hope breaks through.

00:57.573 --> 00:59.327
Were you annoyed that he got the trailer voice-over?

00:59.926 --> 01:03.611
Man, look, I mean, I've done voice-over work.

01:04.729 --> 01:06.205
It's Morgan Freeman, man.

01:06.469 --> 01:07.503
What are you gonna do?

01:07.642 --> 01:08.841
You know, like, take it bro.

01:09.156 --> 01:10.357
I can't compete with that.

01:10.621 --> 01:13.267
Do you ever talk just to hear the sound of your own voice?

01:13.423 --> 01:17.733
If you're talking just to hear the sound of your own voice, you don't have anything really to say.

01:17.889 --> 01:19.087
Have you got a Morgan Freeman impression?

01:21.239 --> 01:23.781
If you see Harry, ask him because he's got a really good one.

01:24.271 --> 01:25.631
No, I don't.

01:25.936 --> 01:29.407
I would try to but it's terrible.

01:29.825 --> 01:31.991
I would always go, "Be soft," like that.

01:32.356 --> 01:33.064
It's terrible.
