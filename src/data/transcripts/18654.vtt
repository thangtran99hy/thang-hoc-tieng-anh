00:00.163 --> 00:02.785
Germany's Oktoberfest is well underway...

00:02.881 --> 00:05.226
...with millions enjoying the annual beer festival,...

00:05.503 --> 00:08.929
...but it's not only Munich that is hosting a special beer festival.

00:09.139 --> 00:11.469
In the tiny Palestinian village of Taybeh,...

00:11.673 --> 00:16.465
...thousands of locals and visitors have enjoyed their own German inspired Oktoberfest,...

00:16.664 --> 00:20.940
...and descended on the village which claims to produce the only Palestinian beer.

00:21.829 --> 00:25.485
And my friend Simon told me about this festival here,...

00:26.385 --> 00:30.117
...and he said it's like the Oktoberfest in Germany,...

00:30.585 --> 00:32.965
...and I thought if something here is like in Germany,...

00:33.027 --> 00:33.757
...I will go here.

00:34.296 --> 00:36.987
The Taybeh Festival, which began in 2005,...

00:37.056 --> 00:39.179
...is a world away from the Gaza Strip,...

00:39.425 --> 00:42.521
...the other area Palestinians want for their future state,...

00:42.677 --> 00:46.062
...where the Islamic militant group Hamas has forbidden alcohol...

00:46.145 --> 00:49.230
...and imposed severe rules for men and women in public.

00:50.293 --> 00:52.871
Today, many Palestinians see the Taybeh Festival...

00:52.937 --> 00:55.891
...as an opportunity to boost the sagging local economy,...

00:56.033 --> 00:59.325
...and many go to enjoy Palestinian music and dance troupes,...

00:59.405 --> 01:03.165
...and quite a few more simply want to quaff the local ale.
