00:00.275 --> 00:01.624
I'm optimistic about the future.

00:01.833 --> 00:03.839
I'm excited about our prospects as a nation.

00:04.453 --> 00:05.529
I want to see peace.

00:05.773 --> 00:07.855
I want to see growing peace in this country.

00:07.926 --> 00:08.538
It's our objective.

00:09.189 --> 00:11.139
We have an opportunity to have real leadership.

00:11.615 --> 00:13.385
America's going to have that kind of leadership...

00:13.503 --> 00:16.008
...and continue to promote principles of peace...

00:16.465 --> 00:18.208
...to make a world a safer place...

00:18.573 --> 00:22.925
...and make people in this country more confident that their future is secure.

00:23.851 --> 00:25.905
I also want to make sure that we get this economy going.

00:26.729 --> 00:28.824
And there are two very different paths the country can take.

00:29.653 --> 00:31.505
One is a path represented by the president,...

00:31.618 --> 00:36.530
...which at the end of four years would mean we'd have 20 trillion dollars in debt heading towards Greece.

00:37.263 --> 00:38.984
I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.

00:39.629 --> 00:43.428
The president's path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay.

00:44.071 --> 00:46.822
I want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow.

00:47.456 --> 00:51.927
The president's path means 20 million people out of work struggling for a good job.

00:52.195 --> 00:55.232
I'll get people back to work with 12 million new jobs.

00:55.748 --> 00:59.985
I'm going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps, not by cutting the program,...

01:00.047 --> 01:01.489
...but by getting them good jobs.

01:02.151 --> 01:04.517
America's going to come back, and for that to happen,...

01:05.003 --> 01:07.831
...we're going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle.

01:08.721 --> 01:11.941
I was in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat.

01:12.587 --> 01:15.138
I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle.

01:15.231 --> 01:16.679
We've got to do that in Washington.

01:17.191 --> 01:18.399
Washington is broken.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.817
I know what it takes to get this country back...

01:20.911 --> 01:24.249
...and will work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that.

01:24.963 --> 01:26.789
This nation is a hope of the Earth.

01:27.928 --> 01:32.017
We've been blessed by having a nation that's free and prosperous,...

01:32.116 --> 01:34.302
...thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation.

01:34.845 --> 01:37.189
They've held a torch for the world to see;...

01:37.643 --> 01:39.633
...the torch of freedom and hope and opportunity.

01:40.229 --> 01:42.401
Now, it's our turn to take that torch.

01:43.067 --> 01:44.113
I'm convinced we'll do it.

01:44.629 --> 01:45.639
We need strong leadership.

01:46.297 --> 01:48.331
I'd like to be that leader with your support.

01:48.978 --> 01:49.750
I'll work with you.

01:50.327 --> 01:52.064
I'll lead you in an open and honest way.

01:52.536 --> 01:53.589
And I ask for your vote.

01:53.883 --> 01:55.681
I'd like to be the next president of the United States...

01:55.772 --> 01:57.595
...to support and help this great nation...

01:57.975 --> 02:01.794
...and to make sure that we all together maintain America as the hope of the Earth.

02:02.125 --> 02:02.954
Thank you so much.
