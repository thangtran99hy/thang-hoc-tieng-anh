You've now heard three debates, months of campaigning and way too many TV commercials.

00:08.459 --> 00:09.555
And now you've got a choice.

00:10.723 --> 00:15.701
Over the last four years, we've made real progress digging our way out of policies that...

00:16.640 --> 00:22.437
...gave us two prolonged wars, record deficits and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.

00:23.607 --> 00:26.419
And Governor Romney wants to take us back to those policies.

00:27.315 --> 00:29.452
A foreign policy that's wrong and reckless.

00:30.383 --> 00:33.905
Economic policies that won't create jobs, won't reduce our deficit,...

00:34.489 --> 00:39.278
...but will make sure that folks at the very top don't have to play by the same rules that you do.

00:40.273 --> 00:41.887
I've got a different vision for America.

00:42.737 --> 00:43.993
I want to build on our strengths.

00:44.765 --> 00:49.179
And I've put forward a plan to make sure that we're bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores...

00:50.025 --> 00:54.522
...by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas.

00:55.187 --> 00:57.904
I want to make sure we've got the best education system in the world.

00:57.999 --> 01:01.253
And we're retaining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.

01:02.152 --> 01:06.629
I want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas...

01:06.753 --> 01:08.515
...but also the energy sources of the future.

01:09.987 --> 01:13.145
Yes, I want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending that we don't need...

01:13.293 --> 01:15.755
...but also by asking the wealthy to do a little bit more...

01:16.777 --> 01:19.199
...so that we can invest in things like research and technology...

01:19.493 --> 01:22.097
...that are the key to a 21st century economy.

01:23.360 --> 01:26.756
As Commander in Chief, I will maintain the strongest military in the world,...

01:27.118 --> 01:31.080
...keep faith with our troops and go after those who would do us harm.

01:32.015 --> 01:34.660
But after a decade of war,...

01:34.785 --> 01:37.529
...I think we all recognize we've got to do some nation building here at home:...

01:37.769 --> 01:39.081
...rebuilding our roads, our bridges,...

01:39.519 --> 01:43.182
...and especially caring for our veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom.

01:44.467 --> 01:45.755
And we've been through tough times,...

01:46.291 --> 01:49.173
....but we always bounce back because of our character,...

01:49.641 --> 01:50.855
...because we pull together.

01:51.406 --> 01:54.306
And if I have the privilege of being your president for another four years,...

01:54.401 --> 01:56.538
...I promise you I will always listen to your voices.

01:56.674 --> 01:58.009
I will fight for your families.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.594
And I will work every single day...

02:00.667 --> 02:03.589
...to make sure that America continues to be the greatest nation on Earth.

02:04.592 --> 02:04.785
Thank you.
