Let's see, our next question is from Joanne S. from Toronto, Ontario who's asking,...

00:06.303 --> 00:08.583
..."Why is the food at McDonald's so cheap?"

00:09.331 --> 00:13.106
Well, hi Joanne, I'm John Betts, president of McDonald's here in Canada.

00:13.434 --> 00:14.697
You ask a great question.

00:15.444 --> 00:17.485
And if you think about when you go out and shop for the family,...

00:17.598 --> 00:22.031
...when you buy those large containers with lots of whatever it is that you're buying,...

00:22.132 --> 00:24.783
...you know you can often get them at a cheaper price...

00:24.976 --> 00:26.116
...because you're buying in bulk.

00:26.977 --> 00:29.545
Well, when you buy for 1400 restaurants in Canada,...

00:30.053 --> 00:33.684
...you get some great deals that we love to pass along to our customers.

00:34.720 --> 00:38.300
Last year, we bought 70 million pounds of ground beef,...

00:39.257 --> 00:44.290
...65 million Canadian grade A eggs.

00:44.990 --> 00:46.314
That's a lot of buying power.

00:46.877 --> 00:51.550
We're buying from some of the great suppliers that you have an opportunity to buy from here in Canada as well,...

00:52.022 --> 00:57.839
...such as Renee's, Cargill, Saputo, Coke, Heinz, and many more.

00:59.064 --> 01:05.485
The opportunity to pass along these savings to our customers is one of the things that we pride ourselves at McDonald's.

01:05.699 --> 01:09.707
It's about providing great quality, great tasting food at a great value.

01:09.993 --> 01:14.583
And when you buy in bulk like we do, you can pass along the savings and that's exactly what we do.

01:14.970 --> 01:16.312
Thanks for the question, Joanne!
