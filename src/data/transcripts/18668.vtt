In "Love Works," I write about seven timeless principles for effective leaders.

00:09.194 --> 00:13.215
We actually defined "love" and how to use it in the workplace.

00:14.028 --> 00:20.301
Now, in my thirty years experience, most recently as CEO of Saab North America and CEO of Herschend Entertainment,...

00:20.922 --> 00:25.723
...I've found that we're all very quick as leaders to talk about love and our personal lives,...

00:26.260 --> 00:28.695
...but we're loathe to talk about it in the workplace.

00:29.547 --> 00:32.296
It's because I think we see it as soft.

00:32.665 --> 00:33.952
We see it as an emotion.

00:34.823 --> 00:37.249
But in "Love Works," we show that it's a verb.

00:37.661 --> 00:38.687
It's how you behave.

00:38.770 --> 00:39.944
It's not how you feel,...

00:40.798 --> 00:44.413
...and it also gets the very best results out of those you lead...

00:44.694 --> 00:49.015
...because it builds healthy relationships that brings out the very best in people...

00:49.334 --> 00:51.994
...and makes them incredibly loyal employees.

00:52.635 --> 00:56.939
By reading "Love Works," you'll find that you don't have to leave your heart at home.

00:57.093 --> 00:58.308
You can bring it to work,...

00:58.544 --> 01:01.009
...and you can also get great results while you're doing it.

01:02.645 --> 01:09.531
You'll learn to invest in your company by investing in the relationships of those you work with as the leader.
