People ask me often about how to conduct themselves in a Japanese business meeting.

00:12.751 --> 00:15.497
First thing is the bow or shake question.

00:16.173 --> 00:22.588
You know, bowing is very important and you should definitely learn how to bow sincerely in Japan...

00:23.421 --> 00:27.176
...but often Japanese businessmen want to shake your hand, of course.

00:28.083 --> 00:33.514
But bowing for them is second nature so they might bow and shake at the same time.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.145
Be flexible.

00:35.943 --> 00:40.933
Bow, shake, do whatever your counterpart wants you to do.

00:42.367 --> 00:47.650
But then, when you sit down, pay attention because you will be directed to a proper seat.

00:48.033 --> 00:51.098
There's a proper seat for everyone in a Japanese business meeting:...

00:51.411 --> 00:54.811
...according to position and whether you're the host or the guest.

00:55.321 --> 00:59.195
So look and you'll be guided, take your proper seat.

00:59.878 --> 01:02.856
And of course, business cards are always important.

01:02.953 --> 01:04.877
You get a business card, you study it.

01:05.101 --> 01:06.254
You don't just put it away.

01:06.529 --> 01:08.307
Give yours graciously.

01:08.816 --> 01:13.650
Take the one from your counterpart and study it.

01:13.750 --> 01:15.100
Take note of his position.

01:15.657 --> 01:18.035
Even make conversation out of it if you can.

01:19.304 --> 01:21.774
Finally, giving and receiving gifts.

01:23.046 --> 01:26.478
Gifts are great, Japanese people like to present you with something...

01:26.795 --> 01:29.828
...and it will be really good for you to have something.

01:30.374 --> 01:35.419
Any little gift is appreciated and it shows you understand Japanese customs.
