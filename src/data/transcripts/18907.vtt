00:07.137 --> 00:08.959
Because your charm may not be enough to save you,...

00:09.195 --> 00:11.011
...try some other ways to stop the laughter.

00:11.424 --> 00:17.595
You will need: common sense, sad thoughts, physical pain, and an apology.

00:18.708 --> 00:20.424
Optional: acting skills

00:28.299 --> 00:31.302
Step one: Know when it is inappropriate to laugh.

00:31.857 --> 00:35.047
If you are unsure, ask your mother or someone you can trust.

00:35.579 --> 00:39.699
Step two: Check out others in the room to see if they share your impulse.

00:40.563 --> 00:44.354
If they don't, divert your attention quickly by starting another conversation.

00:48.055 --> 00:51.663
Step three: Think negative or sad thoughts to dampen your mood.

00:52.743 --> 00:56.017
It's usually tension that precedes outbreaks of inappropriate laughter.

00:56.522 --> 01:00.321
Step four: Pinch yourself or bite the inside of your mouth or your lip...

01:00.431 --> 01:01.270
...to contain yourself.

01:01.797 --> 01:03.544
Physical pain can quell laughter.

01:04.813 --> 01:08.577
Step five: Disguise your reaction by faking a coughing fit,...

01:08.742 --> 01:10.281
...using your hand to cover your grin.

01:10.606 --> 01:12.793
This allows you to leave the room and compose yourself.

01:21.430 --> 01:25.080
Step six: Clamp a hand over your mouth and exhale quickly...

01:25.154 --> 01:26.481
...to rob the laugh of fuel.

01:26.820 --> 01:30.704
If caught, apologize without trying to explain, which may add insult to injury.

01:31.427 --> 01:35.610
A laugh can appear to be a crying fit if you are at a funeral or in a sad situation,...

01:35.779 --> 01:37.009
...but it will take good acting.

01:37.251 --> 01:40.814
Step seven: Grit your teeth while pushing your tongue against your palate.

01:41.305 --> 01:43.480
If you have to release it, do it without a smile...

01:43.577 --> 01:45.529
...so people aren't sure what you're responding to.

01:50.033 --> 01:50.769
Did you know?

01:51.570 --> 01:54.895
Pathologic laughing or crying can result from severe brain injury.
