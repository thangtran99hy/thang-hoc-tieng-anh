This is Ian Sherr for the Wall Street Journal in San Francisco.

00:06.392 --> 00:09.318
We've heard from some of the component suppliers in Asia that...

00:09.442 --> 00:14.112
...as many as 10 million units of the smaller tablet that Apple is building...

00:14.204 --> 00:15.685
...are gonna be built during the fourth quarter.

00:16.793 --> 00:20.386
What we know so far is that it's a 7.85-inch screen diagonally,...

00:20.473 --> 00:24.519
...which is smaller than the 9.7-inch screen diagonally that the iPad is right now.

00:25.168 --> 00:27.495
We also know that the screen will be a lower resolution.

00:27.717 --> 00:29.724
What we don't know yet is the release date,...

00:30.493 --> 00:32.075
...and we also don't know what the price will be.

00:32.705 --> 00:34.329
There's a lot of competition right now...

00:34.410 --> 00:37.964
...and pressure on Apple to release a smaller and also cheaper tablet,...

00:38.474 --> 00:41.029
...and that's what a lot of the analysts are expecting.

00:41.319 --> 00:43.367
But of course, this is Apple, we don't know for sure.
