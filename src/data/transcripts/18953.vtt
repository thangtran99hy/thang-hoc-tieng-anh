We'd started the Cartoon Network or were in the process of doing it...

00:03.800 --> 00:11.093
...and I said, you know, there ought to be a cartoon series that has some meat on the bones.

00:11.948 --> 00:17.287
And I said, "We need a superhero for the Earth,"...

00:18.049 --> 00:24.739
...and I came up with kind of a Superman type, Superman, Batman type character...

00:24.817 --> 00:32.328
...who was green and really we decided that...

00:32.543 --> 00:37.997
...but at that point I got a woman named Barbara Pyle who worked with me in the environmental area.

00:38.694 --> 00:48.163
And I got her involved, and she and a fellow named Nick Boxer really produced the show, they took it to the next steps...

00:48.333 --> 00:52.253
...but I came up with the idea of Captain Planet: we had to have a name for him.

00:53.028 --> 00:57.075
And Superman wouldn't do it, that was already taken so...

00:58.049 --> 00:59.183
...Captain Planet was a good name.

00:59.657 --> 01:05.086
There's a lesson and message as well as great entertainment in every episode.

01:05.539 --> 01:09.782
I was an environmentalist when I was a little kid; the natural world fascinated me.

01:10.777 --> 01:15.225
I was reading books before I could read, looking at the pictures of animals and birds and flowers.
