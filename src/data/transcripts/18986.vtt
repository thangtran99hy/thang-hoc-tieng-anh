Thanksgiving for my family used to be a big to-do and...

00:04.463 --> 00:08.848
...you know, as probably everyone else's does whenever grandparents pass away,...

00:08.942 --> 00:13.958
...it kind of becomes on your parent's shoulders, and we really don't do any big traditions.

00:15.923 --> 00:20.975
It was last year or the year before, my sister and I went and volunteered at a shelter and ordered pizza afterwards.

00:21.343 --> 00:25.745
So, we just kind of do whatever, and football is definitely a big part of that,...

00:25.825 --> 00:27.353
...and the parade is definitely a big part of that,...

00:27.806 --> 00:30.819
...and it's just all about being with some people that you love.

00:31.273 --> 00:32.986
What are your plans for Thanksgiving this year?

00:33.235 --> 00:35.144
I don't know yet, that's too far away.

00:35.448 --> 00:37.638
I'm just right here tonight, and that's all I know.

00:38.005 --> 00:41.391
I'm making my own traditions right now; I'm hosting Thanksgiving for the first time.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.501
I've just had to deal with the classic Thanksgiving conundrum of...

00:46.114 --> 00:49.472
...there's too many people coming for this sized turkey I can fit in my oven,...

00:49.849 --> 00:53.561
...so I've decided to make one turkey the traditional way and deep-fry it.

00:53.781 --> 00:55.616
Turkeys shrink, you know that right?

00:56.443 --> 00:57.018
They shrink.

00:57.085 --> 00:58.479
Yeah, but the pan doesn't.

00:58.575 --> 01:01.461
Okay, but I'm just saying, just be aware that they shrink.

01:01.549 --> 01:02.159
That's what I'm gonna do.

01:02.418 --> 01:03.668
Okay, oh yeah, okay, good.

01:04.832 --> 01:07.517
I'm gonna be with my family, and we're all gonna cook together,...

01:07.629 --> 01:11.186
...and I'm super excited about it.

01:13.142 --> 01:18.345
There's actually nothing that I love more than getting together with my family around a dinner table...

01:18.422 --> 01:19.765
...because that's sort of what we're best at.

01:20.213 --> 01:22.581
Canadian, we've had Canadian Thanksgiving,...

01:24.017 --> 01:28.872
...but I mean, it's all about food isn't it, really, so and you know, giving thanks of course,...

01:28.947 --> 01:34.269
...but food seems to be the number one thing we do at my house.

01:34.705 --> 01:39.870
So, it's like three days all towards this like 30-minute meal.

01:40.401 --> 01:44.705
My mom always says that "It takes so long to make it" and then we eat it in two seconds,...

01:44.811 --> 01:49.069
..and we told her she's not allowed to say that anymore, so yeah, that's our tradition.
