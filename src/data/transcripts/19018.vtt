00:08.470 --> 00:10.081
Hi and welcome back to Breakfast Club.

00:10.190 --> 00:11.893
You are still with me, Shah Shamshiri.

00:11.957 --> 00:17.229
And I promised you earlier the very beautiful and talented young woman I have next to me: Shila Amzah.

00:17.296 --> 00:17.757
Good morning, Shila.

00:17.832 --> 00:18.238
How are you?

00:18.296 --> 00:19.141
Hello, good morning.

00:19.316 --> 00:19.879
Okay.

00:20.103 --> 00:20.588
Feeling good?

00:20.891 --> 00:21.951
Yeah, I feel great.

00:22.014 --> 00:23.277
Okay, because I always feel bad.

00:23.837 --> 00:24.272
I'm sorry.

00:24.355 --> 00:26.139
I repeat this every time with my guest because it's true.

00:26.213 --> 00:29.189
I always feel bad taking people out of bed early in the morning.

00:30.488 --> 00:31.413
I already got used to it.

00:31.546 --> 00:32.751
Oh, you already got used to it.

00:33.144 --> 00:34.330
Are you a morning person by the way?

00:34.891 --> 00:36.499
I'm not really a morning person,...

00:36.587 --> 00:39.309
...but my mom always forces me to get out of my bed.

00:39.423 --> 00:40.121
Okay, that's good.

00:40.273 --> 00:40.988
That's a good mother.

00:41.118 --> 00:42.605
We were talking about empowering women,...

00:42.673 --> 00:44.591
...so women should wake up early in the morning.

00:44.813 --> 00:45.271
Oh yeah.

00:45.361 --> 00:49.485
Okay, but I know that of course, it's very different for people in the entertainment world particularly singers,...

00:49.583 --> 00:53.343
...because I know a lot of entertainers, singers, morning is not really a good time.

00:53.418 --> 00:56.777
They're usually more night people because you guys have shows, you guys record at night.

00:57.765 --> 00:58.692
A lot of things are done at night.

00:58.768 --> 01:01.059
Okay, anyway, now we've met Shila Amzah.

01:01.167 --> 01:05.655
You may have remembered her from the reality show 'One in a Million' a few years ago,...

01:05.750 --> 01:06.899
...and she got second place.

01:07.151 --> 01:07.295
Yeah.

01:07.359 --> 01:11.618
And now, a lot of people keep calling you Shila One in a Million, Shila OIAM.

01:11.689 --> 01:13.985
So now, do we address you as Shila or Shila Amzah?

01:14.040 --> 01:14.703
Shila Amzah.

01:15.086 --> 01:15.719
Shila Amzah.

01:16.743 --> 01:17.810
She preferred to be Shila Amzah.

01:17.880 --> 01:23.365
Now for your information, Shila's father was a very famous actor in the 80s particularly.

01:23.423 --> 01:26.860
I remember when I was still a kid watching him on this show.

01:26.937 --> 01:28.687
I forgot he placed his hair stylist...

01:29.707 --> 01:30.242
That is.

01:30.370 --> 01:31.090
I forgot, yeah.

01:31.239 --> 01:33.933
But her father is ND Lala.

01:34.054 --> 01:37.673
He's a very well-known actor and he was also a singer for a while, I remember.

01:37.749 --> 01:38.581
A singer.

01:39.055 --> 01:41.323
Actor, and then now he's a businessman.

01:41.718 --> 01:44.867
And now, his daughter is one of the top singers in the country.

01:44.937 --> 01:46.059
Everybody's talking about her.

01:46.363 --> 01:47.653
Young, upcoming, it's true.

01:48.092 --> 01:49.714
She's got a very beautiful voice.

01:49.780 --> 01:51.010
So you know, very, very beautiful.
