Every year on November 11th, our nation pays respect to Veterans Day,...

00:12.875 --> 00:16.627
...a day when we honor our military veterans and thank them for their service...

00:16.755 --> 00:19.201
...with songs, ceremonies, and festive parades.

00:19.641 --> 00:22.907
It's a proud day filled with meaning for everyone who has served:

00:25.027 --> 00:27.051
the great grandfather at Iwo Jima,...

00:28.773 --> 00:30.609
...low crawling in volcanic ash;...

00:35.373 --> 00:38.011
...the uncle who overcame fear for his own life,...

00:38.889 --> 00:41.791
...fighting an unseen enemy in the jungles of Vietnam;...

00:43.147 --> 00:47.565
...the sister on the streets of Baghdad during civil affairs missions;...

00:48.947 --> 00:51.729
...the friend scanning the valley below for the enemy...

00:51.847 --> 00:53.555
...from a mountaintop in Afghanistan;...

00:54.717 --> 00:58.313
...even higher still, the neighbor who patrols the skies.

01:00.352 --> 01:04.229
Veterans Day is a time to hear the stories of combat and sacrifice...

01:04.302 --> 01:05.650
...from those who served our country,...

01:06.245 --> 01:08.735
...and each has a powerful story to tell.

01:09.659 --> 01:11.156
We have another story to share with you.

01:11.676 --> 01:14.847
It's also a story of honor, integrity, and sacrifice.

01:15.994 --> 01:20.762
Thousands of civilian volunteers, some without any direct connection to the military,...

01:21.039 --> 01:25.977
...are giving their time, effort, and resources in support of our veterans every day.

01:26.583 --> 01:29.488
The World War II Memorial here in Washington, DC...

01:29.829 --> 01:33.241
...is the center of the grassroots effort happening all across this country.

01:36.202 --> 01:40.450
Volunteers for the Honor Flight Network want to make sure World War II veterans...

01:40.748 --> 01:44.209
...get a chance to experience this monument built in their honor.
