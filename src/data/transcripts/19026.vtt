00:00.960 --> 00:02.483
Three teens were arrested today...

00:02.553 --> 00:05.516
...for defacing the Kensington Park War Memorial overnight.

00:06.081 --> 00:09.099
The destruction includes painted messages against the military...

00:09.171 --> 00:10.448
...and the war in the Middle East.

00:11.335 --> 00:13.973
The three teens were picked up in the early morning hours...

00:14.059 --> 00:15.544
...after evidence was left at the scene.

00:18.284 --> 00:19.457
Grandpa, is something wrong?

00:21.037 --> 00:24.279
Some people sure have short memories,...

00:24.983 --> 00:29.455
...and those who are too young to know need to be taught.

00:32.595 --> 00:34.737
Come on, I wanna show you guys something.

00:48.181 --> 01:00.350
Yesterday, December 7th, 1941, a date that will live in infamy.

01:01.451 --> 01:06.735
The United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked...

01:07.849 --> 01:12.403
...by naval and air forces of the empire of Japan.

01:14.183 --> 01:17.952
At dawn, on the morning of the 6th of June 1944,...

01:18.695 --> 01:22.157
...225 rangers jumped off the British landing craft...

01:22.228 --> 01:23.855
...and ran to the bottom of these cliffs.

01:24.873 --> 01:27.039
225 came here.

01:27.675 --> 01:32.022
After two days of fighting, only 90 could still bear arms.

01:32.748 --> 01:35.081
These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc.

01:37.036 --> 01:39.931
These are the men who took the cliffs.

01:40.921 --> 01:43.467
These are the champions who helped free a continent.

01:44.432 --> 01:47.128
These are heroes who helped end a war.

01:48.077 --> 01:51.509
Your men who in your "lives fought for life...

01:52.127 --> 01:55.552
...and left the vivid air signed with your honor."

02:00.725 --> 02:04.719
In the name of God and country, I learned to defy gravity...

02:05.460 --> 02:06.630
...to honor my family.

02:07.099 --> 02:08.977
I lived in the belly of the beast.

02:11.225 --> 02:14.101
I fixed the hearts of iron monsters.

02:14.674 --> 02:17.398
I became a worm in the mud for dignity,...

02:17.745 --> 02:18.598
...for honor,...

02:19.177 --> 02:20.253
...for righteousness' sake.

02:20.925 --> 02:22.267
For God and country,...

02:22.575 --> 02:24.475
...I fought for you.

02:24.723 --> 02:25.858
I fought for you,...

02:26.891 --> 02:27.234
...for you.

02:27.723 --> 02:28.852
I fought for you.
