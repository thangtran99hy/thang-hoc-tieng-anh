All of the defenders of freedom and their families pay a high price;...

00:09.284 --> 00:11.449
...some of those never return home,...

00:12.157 --> 00:17.295
...and a few are never identified, never to be reunited with their families.

00:19.685 --> 00:23.945
Since July 2nd, 1937, the Tomb of the Unknowns...

00:24.049 --> 00:29.308
...has been guarded 24 hours a day, 365 days a year...

00:29.735 --> 00:32.989
...to honor those fallen defenders of our way of life.

00:37.604 --> 00:42.777
This is retired Marine and NRA Secretary Major Jim Land,...

00:43.029 --> 00:46.616
...reminding you to take a few moments this Veterans Day...

00:46.837 --> 00:48.907
...to tell a vet, "Thank you."

00:49.757 --> 00:54.479
Courageous men and women like them continue to stand on the front lines of freedom...

00:54.703 --> 00:58.451
...so that the values we cherish remain secure.
