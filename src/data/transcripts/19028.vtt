Hey, this is Joshua with The Verge,...

00:02.726 --> 00:06.480
...and we are looking at and holding the new iPad Mini.

00:07.113 --> 00:08.378
It is incredibly small.

00:08.503 --> 00:12.307
You can actually see, as a comparison with the original iPad or the new iPad,...

00:13.305 --> 00:14.852
...very big difference in size.

00:15.210 --> 00:18.004
It's obviously a more of a one-handed device for reading.

00:19.313 --> 00:22.034
I'll be taking it to bed with me romantically.

00:22.432 --> 00:27.083
And as you could see, it's extremely thin, 7.2 millimeters,...

00:27.461 --> 00:30.223
...and it's very light, 0.68 pounds.

00:30.288 --> 00:34.344
The screen is a 7.9 inch, 1024 by 768 display,...

00:34.427 --> 00:37.281
...but at the smaller size, the resolution looks higher...

00:37.391 --> 00:39.305
...than if you look at an iPad 2 in comparison.

00:39.559 --> 00:42.610
This definitely looks a lot tighter as far as pixel density is concerned.

00:43.161 --> 00:44.735
It does feel incredibly light in the hand.

00:45.335 --> 00:48.066
This version that I'm holding has an LTE option,...

00:48.345 --> 00:49.919
...and as I mentioned in my write-up,...

00:50.418 --> 00:54.441
...the build quality of this is, you know, you expect from Apple a great build quality,...

00:54.539 --> 00:56.945
...but in comparison to other 7-inch tablets on the market,...

00:57.278 --> 00:58.243
...it's night and day.

00:58.367 --> 00:59.741
Compared to something like the Nexus 7,...

00:59.841 --> 01:04.225
...this just feels like a really high-end piece of technology.

01:05.312 --> 01:07.615
You see here speakers on the bottom, Lightning connector...

01:08.509 --> 01:12.797
...and it is exactly what you expect, the smaller iPad.

01:13.253 --> 01:15.491
329 is the starting price for 16 gig,...

01:16.167 --> 01:18.487
...and it goes up from there depending what kind of storage...

01:18.568 --> 01:20.942
...and whether or not you're adding wireless options,...

01:21.259 --> 01:22.255
...cellular options.

01:22.687 --> 01:24.519
So, that's a quick look at the Mini,...

01:24.622 --> 01:27.845
...and we'll have more information and more photos and more video coming soon.
