The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle.

00:11.860 --> 00:13.435
For my sister Crista.

00:16.077 --> 00:19.766
In the light of the moon, a little egg lay on a leaf.

00:21.485 --> 00:24.832
One Sunday morning, the warm sun came up...

00:24.944 --> 00:30.711
...and popped out of the egg came a tiny and very hungry caterpillar.

00:33.403 --> 00:35.638
He started to look for some food.

00:36.367 --> 00:38.689
On Monday, he ate through one apple.

00:38.828 --> 00:40.607
But he was still hungry.

00:41.568 --> 00:44.388
On Tuesday, he ate through two pears.

00:44.831 --> 00:46.964
But he was still hungry.

00:47.822 --> 00:50.811
On Wednesday, he ate through three plums.

00:51.089 --> 00:53.063
But he was still hungry.

00:53.662 --> 00:56.940
On Thursday, he ate through four strawberries.

00:57.176 --> 00:59.181
But he was still hungry.

00:59.827 --> 01:03.280
On Friday, he ate through five oranges.

01:03.379 --> 01:05.142
But he was still hungry.

01:06.545 --> 01:11.488
On Saturday, he ate through: one piece of chocolate cake, one ice cream cone,...

01:11.583 --> 01:15.415
...one pickle, one slice of Swiss cheese, one slice of salami,...

01:15.554 --> 01:19.000
...one lollipop, one piece of cherry pie, one sausage,...

01:19.265 --> 01:22.519
...one cupcake, and one slice of watermelon.

01:23.121 --> 01:25.274
That night, he had a stomachache.

01:26.580 --> 01:28.351
The next day was Sunday again.

01:28.949 --> 01:31.945
The caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf.

01:32.275 --> 01:34.867
And after that, he felt much better.

01:36.247 --> 01:38.291
Now, he wasn't hungry anymore.

01:38.547 --> 01:41.525
And he wasn't a little caterpillar anymore.

01:41.955 --> 01:44.473
He was a big, fat caterpillar.

01:45.125 --> 01:48.938
He built a small house, called a cocoon, around himself.

01:49.426 --> 01:51.991
He stayed inside for more than two weeks.

01:52.141 --> 01:54.580
Then, he nibbled a hole in the cocoon,...

01:55.267 --> 01:57.991
...pushed his way out and...

01:58.709 --> 02:00.989
...he was a beautiful butterfly.
