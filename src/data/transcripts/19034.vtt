My name is Adam Garone.

00:03.268 --> 00:07.379
I'm CEO and one of the co-founders of Movember, the month formerly known as November...

00:07.463 --> 00:10.959
...where we get men to grow mustaches to raise awareness and funds for men's health,...

00:11.024 --> 00:12.406
...specifically prostate cancer.

00:12.653 --> 00:14.607
Essentially, I'm a mustache farmer,...

00:14.825 --> 00:16.342
...and our season is November.

00:16.403 --> 00:18.987
In Australia, "mo" is slang for mustache.

00:19.120 --> 00:23.137
Movember started in a really nontraditional way, but in a very traditional Australian way.

00:23.223 --> 00:26.743
It was over beers on a Sunday afternoon with my brother and another mate,...

00:26.829 --> 00:31.516
...and we're all talking about 70s fashion and how everything comes back into style,...

00:31.730 --> 00:33.984
...and the conversation turned to, you know, what hasn't come back...

00:34.453 --> 00:35.729
...and whatever happened to the mustache?

00:35.831 --> 00:38.221
And the day ended with a challenge to bring back the mustache.

00:38.346 --> 00:40.953
Let's choose November, rename it Movember...

00:41.262 --> 00:43.904
...and create the basic rules, which start the month clean-shaven,...

00:44.311 --> 00:45.938
...grow a mustache for 30 days,...

00:46.432 --> 00:47.786
...and raise awareness and funds.

00:47.996 --> 00:49.947
It really is a grassroots movement.

00:50.285 --> 00:52.452
At its heart, it is a little bit rebellious.

00:52.518 --> 00:56.268
A lot of guys do Movember to annoy their girlfriends, to annoy their bosses,...

00:56.393 --> 00:59.080
...and it's validated because they're doing it for a good cause.

00:59.431 --> 01:03.005
I get comments ranging from, "Wow! That's a killer mustache."...

01:03.189 --> 01:07.092
...or something like, "Wow! What are you doing?"

01:08.033 --> 01:11.735
And that one's the best because I say, "Well, I'm participating in Movember."

01:11.808 --> 01:12.830
"Have you heard of Movember?"

01:12.937 --> 01:15.362
The best thing about being a Mo Bro is doing my part.

01:15.501 --> 01:16.803
I don't think we have a choice.

01:17.025 --> 01:18.249
You have to do something.

01:18.701 --> 01:20.198
Everybody has to do something.

01:20.404 --> 01:23.572
During Movember 2004, which was our first fundraising year,...

01:23.668 --> 01:25.613
...we had 450 guys in Australia,...

01:25.675 --> 01:28.181
...and together we raised 54,000 dollars.

01:28.338 --> 01:34.238
With the advent of social media, you'll reach personally so much greater through Twitter and through Facebook.

01:34.369 --> 01:39.322
Cut to Movember 2010, we had 450,000 guys spread across the world,...

01:39.623 --> 01:41.563
...and we raised 81 million dollars.

01:45.529 --> 01:49.572
Ten years from now, I firmly believe that through the power of Movember...

01:50.105 --> 01:52.319
...that we can effectively cure prostate cancer.
