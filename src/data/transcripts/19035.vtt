00:10.963 --> 00:13.491
I probably would make a time machine.

00:14.330 --> 00:16.615
I would make medicine for the sick.

00:17.141 --> 00:18.735
I'd probably invent something new.

00:21.770 --> 00:24.159
If I could have an extra five years to live,...

00:24.251 --> 00:25.209
You said five, right?

00:25.485 --> 00:26.417
Five years?

00:27.281 --> 00:28.702
It's a long time.

00:28.815 --> 00:31.713
...I would try to fix everything I did bad.

00:31.863 --> 00:34.475
I would bring my uncle back 'cause I miss him very much.

00:34.551 --> 00:36.607
I would get more hamsters.

00:36.790 --> 00:39.404
I would probably wanna go looking for dark matter.

00:39.593 --> 00:41.605
I think I'd go looking for aliens.

00:41.993 --> 00:44.239
If I could live an extra five years,...

00:44.309 --> 00:49.108
...I was thinking about making like a helicopter, like a wooden helicopter,...

00:50.314 --> 00:51.307
...but I don't have any wood.

00:51.837 --> 00:54.249
I wanna go check out the moon sometime.

00:54.739 --> 00:57.893
I'd probably teach my sister not to hate tuna.

00:58.078 --> 01:02.598
I would try to invent a machine that lets you run at light speed.

01:02.853 --> 01:06.566
If I have five more extra years to live,...

01:08.715 --> 01:11.946
...I would be the boss of all the chipmunks.

01:15.915 --> 01:17.953
I don't really know, I think I'd do anything.

01:18.217 --> 01:19.583
Why are you asking me that?
