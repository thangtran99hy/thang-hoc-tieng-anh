00:01.403 --> 00:04.091
Drawing poppies between the crosses row on row,...

00:04.363 --> 00:08.011
...reciting "In Flanders Fields" while visualizing a time so long ago.

00:08.339 --> 00:12.024
Years before reason, rationalization, and political bias sets in,...

00:12.513 --> 00:15.087
...these children here at Ottawa's Mindware Academy...

00:15.377 --> 00:17.605
...create their own ideas of Remembrance Day:...

00:17.818 --> 00:22.513
...sadness, but also happiness, for the people that survived;...

00:22.679 --> 00:27.334
...a time to remember all the people who gave their lives...

00:27.415 --> 00:30.067
...to make a world a better place today;...

00:30.229 --> 00:35.839
...remembering soldiers that passed away in World War II or World War I.

00:35.911 --> 00:38.165
He goes on to say he also thinks about soldiers...

00:38.297 --> 00:39.485
...who are currently at war.

00:41.384 --> 00:43.801
They kind of fight for us...

00:44.220 --> 00:49.639
...so the other team doesn't get to our place and take over our school.

00:49.847 --> 00:51.425
These children all wear poppies...

00:51.508 --> 00:53.927
...and more importantly, know why they're wearing them:...

00:54.161 --> 00:56.643
...because it represents the people that passed away...

00:56.729 --> 00:58.857
...and the people that fought and survived.

00:59.003 --> 01:02.643
You have to remember about the soldiers in your heart.

01:03.067 --> 01:04.131
That's the reason why.

01:05.854 --> 01:07.457
Kyle here made his own poppy.

01:07.577 --> 01:11.071
Right now, it's made of Lego, that's my favorite.

01:11.509 --> 01:13.622
I have tons of Lego at my house,...

01:14.050 --> 01:16.550
...so I have good designs in my head.

01:16.856 --> 01:17.826
Do you think it'll ever catch on...

01:17.905 --> 01:19.867
...and everyone will be walking around with Lego poppies?

01:20.420 --> 01:23.600
Well, I'm not sure because I don't have a lot of Lego pieces...

01:23.737 --> 01:25.645
...left of red and black pieces,...

01:26.145 --> 01:27.799
...so I have to see about that one.

01:28.036 --> 01:30.586
Like many schools across the region, Mindware Academy....

01:30.693 --> 01:34.385
...will offer Remembrance Day ceremony and moment of silence later this morning.

01:34.553 --> 01:36.573
They did a whole bunch of things for us,...

01:36.925 --> 01:39.405
...so it's not that hard to take one minute out of your time...

01:39.473 --> 01:43.089
...to bow your heads and think of the people who sacrificed their lives for us.

01:44.086 --> 01:46.040
In Ottawa, Laura Lowe, A Morning.
