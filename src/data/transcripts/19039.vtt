00:02.315 --> 00:03.059
Thank you.

00:05.299 --> 00:09.419
I have just called President Obama to congratulate him on his victory.

00:10.085 --> 00:14.495
His supporters and his campaign also deserve congratulations.

00:15.099 --> 00:20.663
I wish all of them well, but particularly the President, the First Lady and their daughters.

00:21.367 --> 00:23.781
This is a time of great challenges for America...

00:24.279 --> 00:28.559
...and I pray that the President will be successful in guiding our nation.

00:35.471 --> 00:40.339
I want to thank Paul Ryan for all that he has done for our campaign and for our country.

00:41.713 --> 00:46.571
Besides my wife Ann, Paul was the best choice I've ever made.

00:50.866 --> 00:55.449
And I trust that his intellect and his hard work and his commitment to principle...

00:55.913 --> 00:58.744
...will continue to contribute to the good of our nation.

01:01.125 --> 01:03.468
I also want to thank Ann, the love of my life.

01:11.475 --> 01:13.350
She would have been a wonderful First Lady.

01:17.469 --> 01:20.563
She has been that and more to me and to our family...

01:21.087 --> 01:25.541
...and to the many people that she has touched with her compassion and her care.

01:26.183 --> 01:28.222
The nation, as you know, is at a critical point.

01:28.896 --> 01:32.837
At a time like this, we can't risk partisan bickering and political posturing.

01:33.435 --> 01:36.488
Our leaders have to reach across the aisle to do the people's work.

01:37.418 --> 01:38.606
I believe in America.

01:39.366 --> 01:40.840
I believe in the people of America.

02:04.417 --> 02:07.364
And I ran for office because I'm concerned about America.

02:08.078 --> 02:11.641
This election is over, but our principles endure.

02:12.393 --> 02:15.393
I believe that the principles upon which this nation was founded...

02:15.841 --> 02:20.234
...are the only sure guide to a resurgent economy and to a new greatness.

02:21.155 --> 02:25.124
Like so many of you, Paul and I have left everything on the field.

02:25.367 --> 02:27.609
We have given our all to this campaign.

02:34.557 --> 02:35.829
I so wish,...

02:36.763 --> 02:41.632
...I so wish that I had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead the country in a different direction.

02:42.143 --> 02:43.851
But the nation chose another leader.

02:44.363 --> 02:50.003
And so Ann and I join with you to earnestly pray for him and for this great nation.

02:50.397 --> 02:52.214
Thank you and God bless America.

02:52.674 --> 02:53.623
You guys are the best.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.010
Thank you so much.
