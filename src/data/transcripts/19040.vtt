President Barack Obama has won a second term,...

00:03.263 --> 00:05.667
...overcoming a fierce challenge from Mitt Romney...

00:05.953 --> 00:10.151
...and in the process, becoming the third President in a row to win a second term.

00:10.572 --> 00:14.249
The President surpassed the magic number of 270 electoral votes...

00:14.544 --> 00:18.721
...by winning key states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Iowa, and New Hampshire.

00:19.165 --> 00:23.131
He won despite coming under withering fire from Romney and other Republicans...

00:23.379 --> 00:26.577
...for his handling of the ailing economy and the soaring debt.

00:26.922 --> 00:29.144
The jobless rate during the president's first term...

00:29.423 --> 00:32.120
...was more than 8 percent until just recently.

00:32.543 --> 00:37.369
Exit polls show that 6 of 10 voters cited rising prices and unemployment...

00:37.467 --> 00:42.102
...as their chief concerns, but more blamed George W. Bush than Obama.
