00:14.842 --> 00:17.404
In Flanders Fields, the poppies blow...

00:18.210 --> 00:22.365
...between the crosses, row on row...

00:23.680 --> 00:25.581
...that mark our place.

00:26.055 --> 00:29.213
And in the sky, the larks, still bravely singing, fly,...

00:30.229 --> 00:33.215
...scarce heard amid the guns below.

00:34.581 --> 00:35.659
We are the dead.

00:36.764 --> 00:38.883
Short days ago, we lived,...

00:39.662 --> 00:44.549
...felt dawn, saw sunset glow,...

00:45.113 --> 00:48.141
...loved and were loved.

00:49.799 --> 00:53.391
And now we lie in Flanders Fields.

01:05.261 --> 01:07.507
Take up our quarrel with the foe,...

01:08.481 --> 01:12.064
...to you from failing hands, we throw the torch;...

01:12.473 --> 01:14.435
...be yours to hold it high.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.805
If ye break faith with us who die,...

01:18.345 --> 01:20.492
we shall not sleep,...

01:21.664 --> 01:25.841
...though poppies grow in Flanders Fields.
