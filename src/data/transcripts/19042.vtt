00:00.269 --> 00:01.499
Tonight,...

00:02.918 --> 00:10.121
...more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny,...

00:11.809 --> 00:15.990
...the task of perfecting our union moves forward.

00:22.654 --> 00:24.941
It moves forward because of you.

00:27.657 --> 00:34.806
It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression,...

00:36.202 --> 00:39.623
...the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair...

00:39.717 --> 00:41.053
...to the great heights of hope,...

00:43.237 --> 00:47.629
...the belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams,...

00:48.401 --> 00:54.757
...we are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation and as one people.

01:04.305 --> 01:06.329
Tonight, in this election,...

01:07.094 --> 01:14.158
...you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard,...

01:15.793 --> 01:22.103
...while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back...

01:22.791 --> 01:25.103
...and we know in our hearts...

01:25.921 --> 01:29.177
...that for the United States of America the best is yet to come.
