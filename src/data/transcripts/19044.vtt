00:07.519 --> 00:10.356
No matter how long it may take us...

00:11.495 --> 00:14.736
...to overcome this premeditated invasion,...

00:15.650 --> 00:18.335
...the American people in their righteous might,...

00:19.758 --> 00:22.720
...will win through to absolute victory.

00:32.846 --> 00:34.824
In the long history of the world,...

00:36.040 --> 00:42.489
...only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom...

00:43.333 --> 00:44.997
...in its hour of maximum danger.

00:46.023 --> 00:48.860
I do not shrink from this responsibility.

00:49.022 --> 00:49.923
I welcome it.

00:55.425 --> 01:01.807
The energy, the faith, the devotion, which we bring to this endeavor,...

01:02.940 --> 01:05.521
...will light our country and all who serve it,...

01:10.171 --> 01:14.747
...and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.

01:16.062 --> 01:18.056
And so, my fellow Americans,...

01:18.993 --> 01:23.321
ask not what your country can do for you,...

01:23.951 --> 01:26.205
...ask what you can do for your country.

01:39.569 --> 01:43.997
Winston Churchill said, "the destiny of man is not measured by material computations."

01:44.657 --> 01:46.612
"When great forces are on the move in the world,...

01:46.684 --> 01:48.601
...we learn we're spirits, not animals."

01:49.094 --> 01:52.948
And he said, "There's something going on in time and space and beyond time and space,...

01:53.389 --> 01:55.987
...which whether we like it or not, spells duty."
