00:01.047 --> 00:02.793
How very clumsy of me!

00:05.101 --> 00:08.500
One fine morning, a young click beetle decided to go for a walk.

00:13.169 --> 00:16.145
In the afternoon, it rummaged through a pile of pebbles.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.980
I'm king of the mountain!

00:18.771 --> 00:21.726
In the evening, it crawled among the tall blades of grass.

00:22.003 --> 00:24.787
I can see my burrow from here!

00:25.797 --> 00:28.605
And when it turned night, the young click beetle crept up a tree.

00:29.241 --> 00:31.907
After a while, it got tired and fell to the ground.

00:32.757 --> 00:33.995
It landed on its back.

00:34.799 --> 00:38.116
The young click beetle tried very hard to turn over onto its feet.

00:38.641 --> 00:39.214
But it couldn't.

00:39.304 --> 00:42.131
Help! Help!

00:42.429 --> 00:45.872
All along, a wise old click beetle had been watching the young click beetle.

00:46.385 --> 00:51.045
Tomorrow morning, I will teach you how to click and flip through the air and land on your feet.

00:51.569 --> 00:53.891
In the meantime, you might as well go to sleep.

00:54.241 --> 00:54.759
Good night!

00:57.047 --> 00:59.451
The next morning, the wise old click beetle said,...

00:59.710 --> 01:00.591
"Look at me."

01:00.929 --> 01:02.189
"This is how it is done."

01:04.034 --> 01:06.132
It flipped through the air and landed on its feet.

01:06.555 --> 01:07.720
Now, you try it.

01:08.315 --> 01:09.023
Thank you.

01:09.521 --> 01:10.504
That looks easy.

01:11.538 --> 01:12.596
Look at me!

01:14.285 --> 01:16.786
It flipped through the air but it landed on its back.

01:17.402 --> 01:19.114
How very clumsy of me!

01:19.682 --> 01:21.463
Just then, a turtle ambled by.

01:22.159 --> 01:23.953
Better luck next time.

01:24.356 --> 01:25.521
Keep on trying!

01:26.351 --> 01:27.389
"Look at me!"...

01:27.816 --> 01:29.233
...said the young click beetle.

01:30.675 --> 01:32.869
It flipped through the air but landed on its back.

01:33.904 --> 01:35.623
How very clumsy of me!

01:36.024 --> 01:37.337
"You'll get there,"...

01:37.643 --> 01:38.585
...said the snail.

01:38.853 --> 01:39.876
Look at me!

01:41.374 --> 01:43.764
It flipped through the air but it landed on its back.

01:44.267 --> 01:45.080
Just then,...

01:51.991 --> 01:53.592
"Quick! Click and flip!"...

01:53.749 --> 01:56.243
...cried the wise old click beetle who is watching.

01:57.534 --> 02:01.297
But this time, it did three graceful somersaults and landed on its feet.

02:01.767 --> 02:03.189
Look at you!

02:03.403 --> 02:04.617
You have done it!
