When I say Labor Day, what do you think about?

00:07.897 --> 00:08.396
Barbecues?

00:08.837 --> 00:09.475
Parades?

00:09.959 --> 00:12.631
The end of summer or the beginning of football season?

00:13.184 --> 00:15.083
Well, we at Adecco think about those things too,...

00:15.462 --> 00:17.837
...but we also think about, well, work.

00:18.489 --> 00:21.319
Hey, we connect more people to more jobs than anyone else in the world,...

00:21.601 --> 00:23.219
...so labor is a big part of what we do.

00:23.771 --> 00:24.938
Well, getting back to Labor Day.

00:25.519 --> 00:28.323
Did you know that Labor Day began in New York City in 1882?

00:28.933 --> 00:30.925
It started with sort of a parade.

00:31.601 --> 00:33.137
Actually, it's more like a rally.

00:33.587 --> 00:36.910
20,000 people marched up Broadway to demand an eight-hour work day.

00:37.449 --> 00:40.281
They carried banners that read "Labor creates all wealth"...

00:40.601 --> 00:44.112
...and "8 hours for work, 8 hours for rest, 8 hours for recreation!"...

00:44.615 --> 00:46.559
...and "Adecco totally rocks!"

00:47.572 --> 00:49.815
Okay, maybe not that last one, but you get the idea.

00:50.495 --> 00:52.663
After the parade, there were picnics all around the city.

00:53.132 --> 00:56.748
Workers and celebrants ate Irish stew, homemade bread and apple pie,...

00:57.029 --> 00:58.281
...and enjoyed fireworks at night.

00:58.922 --> 01:00.141
The day was a big hit.

01:00.779 --> 01:02.525
Two years later, the Central Labor Union...

01:02.596 --> 01:05.203
...designated the first Monday in September as Labor Day.

01:05.558 --> 01:09.574
And on June 28th, 1894, Congress made it a national holiday.

01:11.285 --> 01:14.507
So to all of you who work, either on the job, looking for a job,...

01:14.700 --> 01:17.565
...at home with the kids, or wherever you may be, here's to you.

01:17.943 --> 01:19.130
You're what Labor Day's all about.
