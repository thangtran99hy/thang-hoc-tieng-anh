I think I was supposed to talk about my new book, which is called "Blink,"...

00:20.398 --> 00:22.943
...and it's about snap judgments and first impressions...

00:23.483 --> 00:26.978
...and it comes out in January and I hope you all buy it in triplicate.

00:28.681 --> 00:29.793
But I was thinking about this...

00:29.913 --> 00:33.785
...and I realized that although my new book makes me happy,...

00:34.737 --> 00:38.737
...and I think will make my mother happy, it's not really about happiness.

00:39.197 --> 00:45.190
So I decided instead, I would talk about someone who I think has done as much...

00:45.277 --> 00:49.985
...to make Americans happy as perhaps anyone over the last 20 years,...

00:50.431 --> 00:53.359
...a man who is a great personal hero of mine,...

00:54.228 --> 00:59.435
...someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz, who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce.

01:02.538 --> 01:06.910
Howard's about this high, and he's round, and he's in his 60s,...

01:07.002 --> 01:11.615
...and he has big huge glasses and thinning grey hair,...

01:11.677 --> 01:15.289
...and he has a kind of wonderful exuberance and vitality,...

01:15.387 --> 01:19.109
...and he has a parrot and he loves the opera,...

01:19.202 --> 01:23.062
...and he's a great aficionado of medieval history.

01:23.595 --> 01:26.032
And by profession, he's a psychophysicist.

01:26.274 --> 01:30.773
Now, I should tell you that I have no idea what psychophysics is,...

01:30.904 --> 01:32.204
...although at some point in my life,...

01:32.521 --> 01:35.829
...I dated a girl for two years, who was getting her doctorate in psychophysics,...

01:36.879 --> 01:39.237
...which should tell you something about that relationship.

01:42.261 --> 01:45.003
As far as I know, psychophysics is about measuring things.
