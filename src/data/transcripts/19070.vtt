00:05.727 --> 00:06.635
I have a dream.

00:07.514 --> 00:10.769
The time had just come when I had been pushed...

00:10.905 --> 00:14.059
...as far as I could stand to be pushed, I suppose.

00:14.353 --> 00:15.579
I shook up the world!

00:16.103 --> 00:17.037
I shook up the world!

00:17.174 --> 00:21.627
My presence here is one additional bit of evidence...

00:22.825 --> 00:26.913
...that the American dream need not forever be deferred.

00:29.651 --> 00:34.155
I think it made all of us realize that we had a voice.

00:34.268 --> 00:38.396
When radical movements emerge, they create their own temporalities.

00:38.509 --> 00:40.527
They create their own sense of help.

00:40.751 --> 00:41.524
Race isn't real.

00:42.187 --> 00:45.371
It's a concept we invented to divide and separate people, you know what I'm saying?

00:46.089 --> 00:49.651
And I realized that greatness of something beyond yourself.

00:50.482 --> 00:53.748
Amidst all this chaos and turbulence,...

00:54.459 --> 00:59.327
...there's an opportunity to create a new vision of the American dream.

01:00.039 --> 01:02.243
We have not ended racial castes in America,...

01:02.729 --> 01:04.249
...we have merely redesigned it.

01:04.511 --> 01:05.463
Fight the power!

01:07.439 --> 01:08.430
Fight the power!

01:09.093 --> 01:09.398
Fight!

01:09.698 --> 01:11.353
Others have succeeded before me.

01:11.861 --> 01:13.517
I know I can get through this.

01:14.541 --> 01:17.471
They were gonna show America what they could be...

01:17.819 --> 01:20.571
...and in doing so, show America what it could be.
