Misereor, one of Europe's biggest children's charities, fights for destitute children and youths in the developing countries.

00:10.677 --> 00:19.737
But year after year, Misereor faces a much bigger challenge: raising donations, however, small.

00:21.710 --> 00:27.812
But how do you show that as little as two euros can move a lot in the third world.

00:29.536 --> 00:34.189
Misereor presents the power of a coin.

00:42.819 --> 00:47.901
With just two euros, you can support health care in India...

00:52.097 --> 00:54.929
...or agricultural project in South Africa,...

00:59.707 --> 01:01.849
...education for farm children,...

01:04.233 --> 01:08.892
...electricity supply and sponsoring sports in Liberia,...

01:12.661 --> 01:15.066
...or cultural funding in Argentina.

01:19.487 --> 01:22.240
At the end, your photo appears...

01:23.141 --> 01:26.665
...ready to be shared with all of your friends on Facebook.

01:39.264 --> 01:44.749
A myriad of blogs and press articles were dedicated to this interactive billboard.

01:45.849 --> 01:46.587
The message?

01:47.454 --> 01:53.679
No matter how small your donation, there's a power in every coin.
