Bullwinkle's Corner.

00:02.488 --> 00:03.323
Hello there.

00:03.863 --> 00:06.675
Today's poem is called, "My Shadow."

00:07.389 --> 00:08.233
Okay, Rock.

00:10.129 --> 00:10.837
Thank you.

00:11.643 --> 00:14.643
I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,...

00:15.067 --> 00:18.337
...and what can be the use of him is more than I can see.

00:18.921 --> 00:20.703
He stays so close behind me.

00:20.979 --> 00:22.718
He's a coward, you can see.

00:23.066 --> 00:25.465
I'd think shame to stick to nursie like,...

00:29.176 --> 00:30.313
...all right, wise guy.

00:30.395 --> 00:30.776
Put 'em up!

00:30.871 --> 00:31.343
Put 'em up!

00:32.051 --> 00:35.165
Anytime a dingbusted shadow gets flipped with me.

00:37.583 --> 00:39.634
Okay, you've been asking for it.

00:42.865 --> 00:44.642
Well, I still got my secret weapon.

00:45.147 --> 00:47.624
Okay, Rocky, turn off the light.

00:49.161 --> 00:51.435
Oh, fiddle-faddle.
