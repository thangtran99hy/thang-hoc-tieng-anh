If you could somehow look into the future and you found out that two years from now,...

00:06.896 --> 00:10.727
...you would develop a disease that would confine you to a hospital bed until the day you died,...

00:11.875 --> 00:14.775
...would you change anything about the way you're living your life right now?

00:16.356 --> 00:19.647
Have you ever stopped and asked yourself if you're truly living each day to the fullest?

00:20.412 --> 00:22.051
Or are you letting your life pass you by?

00:23.563 --> 00:26.338
My name is Duane and I'd say I have a pretty good life.

00:27.773 --> 00:30.285
I've got a fun career doing something that I really enjoy.

00:31.758 --> 00:33.108
I'm young and in good health.

00:34.534 --> 00:35.964
And I've got some great friends and family.

00:37.015 --> 00:41.125
But recent events have caused me to ask myself if I've truly been making the most of my life.

00:41.845 --> 00:47.645
And one of the biggest things I've realized is that I've been so wrapped up in the pursuit of material wealth and building my career,...

00:47.984 --> 00:51.632
...but I haven't taken many opportunities to sit back and appreciate the world around me.

00:52.605 --> 00:57.495
I've let the fear of being unsuccessful get in the way of doing many of the things that I've always wanted to do.

00:58.658 --> 01:00.365
So, I figured it's time to make a change.

01:03.640 --> 01:06.529
I've come up with a concept of reset, live, and grow.

01:08.709 --> 01:13.429
I'm gonna start by completely resetting my approach to life and reevaluating how I spend my time.

01:14.125 --> 01:19.367
Then, I'm gonna do my best to live in the present moment and challenge myself to try new things that I was too afraid to do in the past.

01:19.985 --> 01:23.351
And I think ultimately these things are gonna help me grow into a bigger person.

01:24.192 --> 01:25.955
So, I've decided to put my career on pause...

01:26.326 --> 01:28.620
...to travel the world and gain a new perspective on life.

01:29.518 --> 01:30.743
It's sort of like a mini retirement.

01:31.747 --> 01:34.747
I'm gonna take my video camera with me to document the whole process...

01:35.171 --> 01:38.654
...as I experience all kinds of new things in various countries around the world.

01:39.625 --> 01:44.922
This is gonna be a huge journey for me and I'm making a big sacrifice to do it but in the end I know it's gonna be worth it.
