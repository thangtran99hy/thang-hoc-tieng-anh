00:00.179 --> 00:03.621
Now, imagine a city that's growing by half a million people in a month.

00:03.952 --> 00:05.267
This is Second Life.

00:05.596 --> 00:08.020
Not a real place but a virtual online world...

00:08.121 --> 00:10.552
...where participants lead fantasy lives.

00:10.745 --> 00:13.554
In total, one and a half million people have created...

00:13.732 --> 00:15.810
...fictional versions of themselves here.

00:16.322 --> 00:19.247
That's enough people to fill Birmingham and Edinburgh.

00:19.752 --> 00:23.027
And here is where fiction meets reality: they're spending real money.

00:23.581 --> 00:26.291
From Second Life, Rory Cellan-Jones reports.

00:31.273 --> 00:33.473
Fly with me into a whole new world.

00:33.581 --> 00:38.617
This rather strange-looking fellow is my avatar, my virtual me in Second Life.

00:40.391 --> 00:42.090
Let's drop in on one of the residents.

00:43.888 --> 00:48.275
Andy spends a lot of time in this world which the residents build for themselves.

00:48.856 --> 00:51.820
Here's what he looks like in real life, where he is a college lecturer.

00:52.408 --> 00:55.021
At first, it's difficult to see the point of Second Life,...

00:55.367 --> 00:57.467
...but Andy says there's an awful lot you can do.

00:58.469 --> 01:02.066
It's an escape for creativity, for exploration, for building friendships there.

01:02.383 --> 01:05.065
They're pushing the boundaries of possibilities, really.

01:05.204 --> 01:05.682
A little bit, yes.

01:05.757 --> 01:08.817
If you can imagine it, you can do it in Second Life, and that's the fun.

01:09.713 --> 01:14.790
Residents pay real money to buy land and can earn cash by selling virtual goods.

01:15.305 --> 01:17.899
Justin here has built a whole business in this world.

01:18.214 --> 01:23.177
His firm in London's East End designs virtual offices and equipment for companies...

01:23.473 --> 01:26.275
...now rushing to establish a presence in Second Life.

01:26.892 --> 01:29.965
People are in there, they're making real livings by buying and selling virtual land...

01:30.045 --> 01:31.623
...and creating product for people...

01:31.890 --> 01:34.977
...so they can adorn their own avatars and clothing or performing services.

01:35.340 --> 01:37.075
For instance, there's wedding planners in there.

01:37.393 --> 01:39.953
There's people who actually do live performance of music in there.
