00:03.290 --> 00:05.087
There are no grand celebrations here.

00:05.965 --> 00:06.986
No speeches.

00:07.350 --> 00:08.464
No bright lights.

00:11.414 --> 00:12.902
But there are great athletes.

00:15.679 --> 00:17.951
Somehow, we've come to believe that greatness...

00:18.073 --> 00:19.718
...is reserved for the chosen few:...

00:21.341 --> 00:22.273
...for the superstars.

00:24.333 --> 00:27.144
The truth is, greatness is for all of us.

00:28.873 --> 00:30.879
This is not about lowering expectations.

00:32.724 --> 00:35.167
It's about raising them for every last one of us...

00:39.377 --> 00:41.823
...because greatness is not in one special place,...

00:44.415 --> 00:46.419
...and it is not in one special person.

00:49.172 --> 00:52.991
Greatness is wherever somebody is trying to find it.
