Today, I am proud to announce the Walt Disney Company is acquiring Lucasfilm,...

00:08.449 --> 00:11.945
...the global entertainment company founded by George Lucas,...

00:12.505 --> 00:15.389
...and the home of the legendary Star Wars franchise.

00:31.408 --> 00:38.267
Fans can expect a new feature film, Star Wars Episode 7, in theaters worldwide in 2015.

00:39.092 --> 00:42.573
And there will be more feature films, as well as consumer products,...

00:42.906 --> 00:46.428
...television projects, games, and theme park attractions.

00:46.699 --> 00:52.715
We've got a plan for 7, 8, 9, which is the end of the trilogy...

00:53.118 --> 00:54.875
...and other films also.

00:55.316 --> 01:04.424
So, we have a large group of ideas and characters and books and all kinds of things.

01:04.499 --> 01:07.176
We could go on making Star Wars for the next hundred years.

01:08.174 --> 01:10.333
I realized, at some point, I needed to retire,...

01:11.031 --> 01:12.926
...and I wanted to go on and do other things,...

01:13.819 --> 01:17.479
...things in philanthropy and doing more experimental kinds of films,...

01:17.565 --> 01:20.276
...but I couldn't really drag my company into that.

01:20.869 --> 01:22.917
I've been a big fan of Disney all my life,...

01:23.767 --> 01:28.804
...from when I was born, first day at Disneyland.

01:30.324 --> 01:31.451
I love Disney movies.

01:31.563 --> 01:36.932
I look at it as I'm investing in Disney 'cause that's my retirement funds.
