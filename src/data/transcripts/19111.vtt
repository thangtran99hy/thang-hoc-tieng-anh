00:00.441 --> 00:01.163
Get in.

00:02.930 --> 00:04.839
Wouldn't we be more comfortable inside the house?

00:05.327 --> 00:07.715
If you're so comfortable in there, why do you want to move?

00:09.337 --> 00:11.608
Okay. We're interested in some flexible home loan options.

00:11.941 --> 00:12.548
Options?

00:13.173 --> 00:14.872
How many homes are you buying, Superman?

00:15.660 --> 00:16.327
Just one.

00:16.714 --> 00:18.806
Then it will be option one.

00:19.116 --> 00:21.775
We just don't want to get stuck with the wrong loan if things change.

00:23.016 --> 00:25.201
You'll have 25 odd years to get used to it.

00:25.609 --> 00:28.147
How about a loan that's half fixed, half variable.

00:28.723 --> 00:30.101
In case we have more kids.

00:30.413 --> 00:30.886
More?

00:31.542 --> 00:32.136
Of them?

00:33.706 --> 00:35.073
Barbara lives in bank world.

00:36.067 --> 00:37.789
