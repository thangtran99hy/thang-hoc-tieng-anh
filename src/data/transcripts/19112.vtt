Hello, I'm Kenneth Powers.

00:04.629 --> 00:07.306
People ask me what's it like being the CEO of K-Swiss.

00:07.783 --> 00:10.809
Well, it's basically the same as being the CEO of any other sports company...

00:11.228 --> 00:12.471
...only 100 times better.

00:13.211 --> 00:16.938
I didn't just sign the baddest athletes; I hired them to run the company.

00:17.613 --> 00:19.971
Like Matt Cassel, my new VP of Marketing.

00:20.131 --> 00:22.541
K-Swiss Tubes: We Let the Dogs Out.

00:22.735 --> 00:23.967
Emphasis on "we".

00:24.539 --> 00:24.863
Who did it?

00:25.120 --> 00:25.510
We did it.

00:26.222 --> 00:26.792
It's good, Cassel.

00:26.973 --> 00:29.336
I brought in Jon "Bones" Jones to run HR.

00:29.420 --> 00:31.817
Shorter lunches, what is that? I'm taking a long lunch.

00:32.635 --> 00:32.894
Oh, wait!

00:35.052 --> 00:39.548
For Director of Community Outreach, I got the ultimate people person: Jillian Michaels.

00:39.623 --> 00:42.313
You want to look like a burrito on your prom dress huh, blondie?

00:42.373 --> 00:44.881
But being the CEO isn't just about firing people,...

00:45.025 --> 00:46.252
...I'm changing the sports world.

00:46.456 --> 00:49.008
Gentlemen, I present to you the athlete of the future...

00:50.551 --> 00:51.700
Kill him, Patrick Willis.

00:51.921 --> 00:53.875
...wearing the training shoe of the future.

00:54.380 --> 00:58.047
Tubes: lightweight, breathable upper top part where the laces are.

00:59.887 --> 01:01.431
I'm changing the business world.

01:01.518 --> 01:08.408
Mark Cuban, I will pay you 25 million dollars if you change your team's name to the Dallas K-Swiss Tubes.

01:09.233 --> 01:09.551
Hell no.

01:09.863 --> 01:11.726
I'm even changing the whole world, world.

01:18.845 --> 01:21.762
Now that is how you run a company like Kenny Powers.

01:22.141 --> 01:24.279
Hot secretary, give me the president on the line.

01:25.053 --> 01:26.612
I just got tired of paying taxes.
