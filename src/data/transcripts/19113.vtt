00:02.894 --> 00:03.163
Oh!

00:07.047 --> 00:08.099
It swam out.

00:08.203 --> 00:09.173
I think you've got a fish.

00:11.353 --> 00:11.747
Pull it up.

00:13.401 --> 00:14.770
Hey!

00:16.049 --> 00:17.179
That's a fishy.

00:17.269 --> 00:17.754
Bring him in.

00:21.093 --> 00:22.526
Hey!

00:23.346 --> 00:24.581
I caught one!

00:25.943 --> 00:26.798
Oh fishy.

00:27.697 --> 00:28.566
Can we touch him?

00:29.637 --> 00:30.404
You can touch him.

00:33.820 --> 00:34.982
Can you touch him?

00:35.225 --> 00:36.151
This is your first fish.

00:38.959 --> 00:40.155
Yeah, I caught some.

00:40.974 --> 00:41.833
What name has he?

00:42.899 --> 00:44.505
I don't know, what do you want to name him?

00:47.759 --> 00:48.441
Hmm, Free.

00:49.549 --> 00:50.329

00:50.882 --> 00:51.032
Free.

00:51.746 --> 00:51.997
Free?

00:53.883 --> 00:55.560
He's a nice fishy.

00:56.032 --> 00:57.102
He's beautiful.

00:57.513 --> 00:58.567
Can you touch him?

00:59.218 --> 01:00.147
Touch him, dad.

01:00.452 --> 01:02.164
You can touch him, I'm holding him up.

01:03.869 --> 01:06.131
I can't, do you wanna touch him?

01:06.436 --> 01:09.133
This is your first fish, you can pet him, give him a little touch.

01:11.755 --> 01:12.025
But...

01:12.458 --> 01:13.019
He likes you.

01:15.331 --> 01:16.185
I touched him.

01:17.677 --> 01:19.399
Okay, we're gonna put him back in the water, okay?

01:19.785 --> 01:20.328
Okay.
