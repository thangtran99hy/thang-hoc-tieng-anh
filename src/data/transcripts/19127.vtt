Chip, do you think that today might be the most perfect day ever?

00:19.579 --> 00:20.739
I think that it might be.

00:21.589 --> 00:22.481
Just look around.

00:23.491 --> 00:24.786
Everything is in its place.

00:27.599 --> 00:31.312
I love sitting here with you, watching the world go by.

00:35.049 --> 00:36.240
It's nice, isn't it?

00:38.331 --> 00:41.417
I've just remembered, Chip, I've got a gift for you.

00:42.679 --> 00:44.135
Yes, it's for you.

00:46.033 --> 00:47.600
Take it, it's nothing.

00:48.187 --> 00:50.435
Take it please, it's really nothing.

00:54.213 --> 00:56.078
See, I told you it was nothing.

00:56.948 --> 00:57.585
Do you like it?

01:03.073 --> 01:04.229
What a perfect day.
