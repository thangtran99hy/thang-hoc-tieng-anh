00:02.339 --> 00:04.879
There are those who walk among us...

00:05.385 --> 00:07.385
...who are champions of discovery,...

00:08.177 --> 00:09.737
...agents of change,...

00:10.695 --> 00:12.532
...and curators of passion.

00:13.787 --> 00:19.202
They challenge us to ask questions like "what," "why" and "how."

00:20.377 --> 00:23.697
They encourage us to explore beyond our backyard,...

00:24.274 --> 00:28.345
...and they captivate our minds and nurture our curiosities.

00:28.811 --> 00:32.283
Because of them, we better understand our world.

00:33.827 --> 00:35.893
We know what causes an earthquake,...

00:36.445 --> 00:38.017
...why a light bulb lights,...

00:38.579 --> 00:40.179
...how clouds produce rain.

00:40.977 --> 00:44.641
They reassure us that it is okay to think without boundary...

00:45.065 --> 00:48.063
...and explore the possibilities of what could be.

00:49.501 --> 00:52.560
There are those who walk among us who inspire us...

00:53.026 --> 00:57.381
...to investigate, to create, to find solutions,...

00:58.873 --> 01:02.554
...to become part of and ultimately, change our world.

01:03.127 --> 01:04.649
For all the things you do,...

01:05.155 --> 01:08.855
...for who you are and for who you inspire us to become,...

01:09.197 --> 01:14.658
...we offer our most sincere thank you to you, our teachers.

01:17.253 --> 01:23.799
The GLOBE Program is proud to partner and interact with a worldwide community of inspiring teachers...

01:23.917 --> 01:28.025
...who cultivate interest and the love of learning through interaction...

01:28.222 --> 01:31.601
...and hands-on engagement and investigation of Earth.

01:32.441 --> 01:35.164
