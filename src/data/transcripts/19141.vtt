Several memorials were established in Pearl Harbor...

00:02.548 --> 00:07.658
...to remember the Japanese air strike on US naval forces on December 7th, 1941.

00:08.633 --> 00:14.523
These memorials now draw in several million people from the US and other nations each year.

00:16.012 --> 00:19.886
The most well-known of these attractions is the USS Arizona Memorial.

00:20.559 --> 00:22.718

00:23.042 --> 00:25.273

00:32.029 --> 00:34.728
Oil from the Arizona still rises from the wreckage.

00:35.745 --> 00:38.982
The oil is referred to as 'The Tears of the Arizona.'

00:39.537 --> 00:43.896
Arizona was declared a national historic landmark in May 1989.

00:45.236 --> 00:48.998

00:57.200 --> 01:00.467
It was dedicated as a memorial in 1972...

01:00.655 --> 01:04.347
...and declared a national historic landmark in 1989.

01:06.169 --> 01:08.290
Although the ship is no longer at Pearl Harbor,...

01:08.565 --> 01:14.294
...the legacy of USS Oklahoma lives on in a memorial dedicated in December 2007.

01:14.535 --> 01:17.351
The black granite wall suggests the hull of the Oklahoma,...

01:18.074 --> 01:21.347
...while the aligned marble represents the crew manning the rails.

01:23.316 --> 01:28.209
USS Missouri was the last US battleship launched and the last to be decommissioned.

01:29.015 --> 01:33.032
The 'Mighty Mo' served as the platform where Japan signed its unconditional surrender...

01:33.098 --> 01:38.342
...to allied forces on September 2nd, 1945, ending the Second World War.

01:39.675 --> 01:42.165
After its final decommissioning in 1992,...

01:42.505 --> 01:46.131
