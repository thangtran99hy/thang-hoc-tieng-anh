Yesterday, December 7th, 1941,...

00:35.328 --> 00:39.106
...a date which will live in infamy.

00:40.908 --> 00:46.142
The United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked...

00:47.325 --> 00:51.653
...by naval and air forces of the empire of Japan.

00:54.095 --> 01:00.775
The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves.

01:02.156 --> 01:05.699
With confidence in our armed forces,...

01:06.579 --> 01:10.820
...with the unbounding determination of our people,...

01:12.070 --> 01:15.932
...we will gain the inevitable triumph.

01:16.421 --> 01:17.824
So help us God.

01:21.160 --> 01:25.110
I ask that the congress declare...

01:26.353 --> 01:39.565
...that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December 7th, 1941,...

01:40.559 --> 01:50.595
...a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese empire.
