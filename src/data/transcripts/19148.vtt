The only thing worse than forgetting someone's name is calling them by the wrong one.

00:09.969 --> 00:13.231
Learn how to lock people's names into your brain with these tricks.

00:13.774 --> 00:19.792
You will need: deep breathing, eye contact, visualization and imagination.

00:20.505 --> 00:24.287
Step one: Take a few deep breaths before you're introduced to someone.

00:24.637 --> 00:28.903
When you're stressed out, the brain activates an enzyme that impairs short-term memory,...

00:29.215 --> 00:31.777
...reducing the chances that you'll remember what you hear.

00:32.980 --> 00:36.446
Step two: Look the person in the eye as they say their name.

00:36.850 --> 00:40.501
Research shows that making eye contact with the speaker doubles your retention.

00:42.297 --> 00:46.626
If you're at a party, wait until all the introductions are made before you hit the buffet.

00:47.025 --> 00:50.302
A Yale study found that memory is best on an empty stomach.

00:51.019 --> 00:54.577
Step three: Say the person's name out loud when you first learn it,...

00:54.749 --> 00:56.726
...as in, "Nice to meet you, John."

00:57.282 --> 01:00.131
Repeating the name activates the auditory part of the brain,...

01:00.415 --> 01:04.323
...and the more senses you use the better chance you have of retaining information.

01:05.323 --> 01:11.089
Step four: When you are told a name, say to yourself, "I will remember that his name is John."

01:11.597 --> 01:15.337
Our brains have a filter that purges information they consider unimportant.

01:15.749 --> 01:19.853
By giving the name extra significance, your brain will be more likely to retain it.

01:20.527 --> 01:24.770
Exercising your brain with games like Scrabble, crossword puzzles and Sudoku...

01:24.955 --> 01:28.544
...improves memory by strengthening neural pathways and creating new ones.

01:29.034 --> 01:34.107
Step five: Take a tip from President Teddy Roosevelt, who was renowned for his name recall.

01:34.587 --> 01:35.160
His secret?

01:35.557 --> 01:39.137
Picturing the person's name written across their forehead when he was first told it.

01:40.228 --> 01:44.290
Step six: Think up a word association that will help you recall the name.

01:44.942 --> 01:47.956
Remember Mrs. Lion by picturing her with a mane and a tail.

01:48.578 --> 01:50.745
Envision a guy named Arnold as the Terminator...

01:51.357 --> 01:52.485
...especially if he's scrawny.

01:52.887 --> 01:55.503
The sillier the association, the better it'll stick.

01:56.403 --> 01:57.036
Did you know?

01:57.486 --> 02:01.677
The average person forgets half of what he's heard within 30 minutes.
