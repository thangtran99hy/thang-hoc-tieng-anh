When you present the facts to your audience,...

00:03.434 --> 00:09.349
...the audience immediately begins to analyze your presentation content.

00:09.826 --> 00:12.504
And when a person is analyzing something,...

00:12.863 --> 00:16.565
...they are generally not excited by that thing.

00:17.255 --> 00:22.446
What this means is that the person becomes bored almost instantly.

00:23.007 --> 00:23.797
So what do you do?

00:24.341 --> 00:27.045
What you should do when you are given a presentation topic...

00:27.143 --> 00:29.274
...and criteria for your presentation...

00:29.781 --> 00:33.903
...is to immediately begin thinking in terms of a story...

00:34.091 --> 00:36.533
...with a beginning, middle and end...

00:36.888 --> 00:41.147
...and some sort of problem or situation to overcome.

00:41.857 --> 00:44.979
Even better is to make that problem or situation...

00:45.065 --> 00:48.490
...something that is dramatic, that has a time restriction,...

00:48.829 --> 00:51.703
...and where the consequences are very severe.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.472
If you can't do that or it's too difficult,...

00:54.950 --> 00:59.233
...then tell a human story of where you were, where you wanted to go...

00:59.355 --> 01:02.931
...and how you got there or are still working at getting there.

01:03.813 --> 01:08.865
This type of presentation style, no matter what the topic or criteria,...

01:09.009 --> 01:10.253
...is definitely possible.

01:10.837 --> 01:13.536
But the major benefit of this presentation style...

01:13.731 --> 01:17.036
...is to draw the audience into your presentation.

01:17.485 --> 01:21.937
Keep their attention and not allow them to analyze your presentation.
