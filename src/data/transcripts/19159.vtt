00:00.172 --> 00:03.754
God may well be with us in our mansions on the hill.

00:04.505 --> 00:05.195
I hope so.

00:05.975 --> 00:09.607
He may well be with us in all manner of controversial stuff.

00:09.853 --> 00:11.267
Maybe, maybe not.

00:11.921 --> 00:15.923
But the one thing we can all agree, all faiths, all ideologies,...

00:16.007 --> 00:18.219
...is that God is with the vulnerable and the poor.

00:18.638 --> 00:22.529
God is in the slums, in the cardboard boxes where the poor play house.

00:22.969 --> 00:28.900
God is in the silence of a mother who has infected her child with a virus that will end both their lives.

00:29.129 --> 00:31.947
God is in the cries heard under the rubble of war.

00:32.117 --> 00:35.271
God is in the debris of wasted opportunity and lives,...

00:35.724 --> 00:38.666
...and God is with us if we are with them.
