To the beautiful and talented and dance gifted Ellen DeGeneres,...

00:04.097 --> 00:05.611
...I give a piece of my past:...

00:06.249 --> 00:09.975
...the original towel from the first time we saw each other. Remember?

00:11.451 --> 00:16.045
We looked deep into each other's eyes, and I was forever trapped in the gorgeous sand pit that is your love.

00:16.951 --> 00:20.783
To commemorate our relationship that transcends the laws of the space-time continuum,...

00:21.011 --> 00:24.237
...which I consider more like suggestions rather than actual laws,...

00:25.550 --> 00:30.000
...I give you this towel, that I will now chew on seductively for a full 15 seconds...

00:30.050 --> 00:31.518
...while thinking of no one but you.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.633
Happy holidays, Ellen, my Ellen.
