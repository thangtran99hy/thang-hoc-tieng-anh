I'm Jennifer Kulina-Lanese,...

00:04.643 --> 00:07.579
...I'm a field responder for the Humane Society of the United States,...

00:08.766 --> 00:14.899
...from Monmouth County, New Jersey, taking care of some of the victims of Hurricane Sandy.

00:15.691 --> 00:16.742
This is Moxie.

00:17.639 --> 00:19.733
Her family was displaced; they were actually,...

00:19.898 --> 00:20.597
Hi Moxie!

00:21.894 --> 00:23.809
They actually had to be rescued.

00:26.685 --> 00:29.050
It's essential that we have pet-friendly shelters.

00:29.505 --> 00:31.078
We know and we've learned from Katrina...

00:31.151 --> 00:33.763
...that folks are not going to leave and abandon their animals.

00:36.189 --> 00:41.534
There is over 25 dogs, almost 20 cats, three birds and a rabbit.

00:44.607 --> 00:45.883
They are here for the long term.

00:46.241 --> 00:49.695
However long it takes, HSUS is committed to providing support.

00:50.322 --> 00:52.765
We don't see this as a short-term cleanup.

00:53.041 --> 00:54.840
We don't know when power is gonna be back on.

00:54.940 --> 00:57.440
We know for sure it's gonna be weeks, maybe even months.

00:58.313 --> 01:00.966
It's heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time.

01:01.827 --> 01:03.195
You see everybody,...

01:04.965 --> 01:07.307
...they've lost everything, but they still have their pets,...

01:08.060 --> 01:09.849
...and I know that gives them a lot of comfort.

01:12.075 --> 01:13.056
But it's heart-wrenching.

01:20.175 --> 01:21.931
We're just happy that we're able to assist.
