Hi, I'm Mallory Jackson, I've been a vegetarian since I was 13...

00:04.169 --> 00:07.165
...so I wanted to share some tips for anyone who's trying to give up meat.

00:08.087 --> 00:11.171
The first thing is learning the benefits of being a vegetarian...

00:11.242 --> 00:14.583
...because this is really what's gonna keep you motivated and on track.

00:14.980 --> 00:21.061
Some of the benefits of being a vegetarian is it lowers your risks of getting certain types of cancers,...

00:21.124 --> 00:29.414
...heart disease, stroke, diabetes, gallstones, obesity, osteoporosis, high blood pressure and a lot more.

00:29.979 --> 00:35.074
The second thing that helped me out a lot was telling people that I was becoming a vegetarian.

00:35.170 --> 00:36.841
You know, trying to get support from them.

00:37.173 --> 00:39.913
I mean, you're not always gonna get it from people but...

00:39.991 --> 00:42.197
...you know the facts, you know the benefits,...

00:42.300 --> 00:44.745
...and you know you're trying to better your health,...

00:44.825 --> 00:47.487
...and why should anyone, you know, put you down for that?

00:47.677 --> 00:54.537
Many celebrities are vegetarians such as Brad Pitt, Ellen DeGeneres, Kelly Clarkson, Kelly Osbourne,...

00:54.907 --> 00:56.617
...Michael Jackson was a vegetarian,...

00:56.728 --> 00:59.835
...Steve-O, Pam Anderson and even Albert Einstein.

00:59.954 --> 01:05.663
The third thing is grocery shopping and figuring out which foods don't have animal product in them.

01:05.974 --> 01:12.591
Some of my favorite vegetarian products are Gimme Lean, Boca Burgers, Tofurky,...

01:12.671 --> 01:16.267
...Garden Burgers, MorningStar or Smart Menu.

01:16.573 --> 01:22.973
You can find these products usually at Stater Brothers, Albertsons, Super A or Trader Joe's.

01:23.760 --> 01:24.783
Since you're giving up meat,...

01:25.148 --> 01:29.738
...you're gonna need a lot of other sources of proteins besides, you know, soy meats.

01:30.008 --> 01:34.615
So it's really important to be eating beans and nuts and seeds...

01:34.685 --> 01:40.148
...because you need to be getting the vitamin B protein that you no longer get from meat.

01:40.442 --> 01:41.602
Hopefully, this helped you out.

01:41.663 --> 01:46.079
If you have any further questions, feel free to message me and contact me.

01:46.164 --> 01:47.944
So, hopefully this helped you out.

01:48.034 --> 01:49.397
Thank you and good luck.
