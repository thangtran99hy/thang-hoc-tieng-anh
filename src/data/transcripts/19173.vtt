00:01.203 --> 00:02.445
They call us gamblers.

00:03.730 --> 00:05.229
They say we depend on luck.

00:06.504 --> 00:08.579
They claim that no one can beat the market...

00:09.020 --> 00:10.653
...and we're wasting our time.

00:11.824 --> 00:13.171
This isn't a real job.

00:13.841 --> 00:15.487
We should give up our hobby, they say.

00:16.979 --> 00:21.839
But if they only knew that we are the masters of risk,...

00:22.408 --> 00:24.647
...the essence of entrepreneurial spirit,...

00:24.975 --> 00:26.836
...the liquidity of the economy.

00:27.697 --> 00:30.813
We live by our wits, eating what we hunt,...

00:31.300 --> 00:35.279
...adapting to the ever-changing jungle landscape that is the market.

00:36.282 --> 00:39.475
We trade the currency you circulate when you shop.

00:40.877 --> 00:43.578
We trade the companies you work for each day.

00:44.636 --> 00:47.759
We trade the gold on the watch on your wrist.

00:48.605 --> 00:51.638
While you wilt at the sight of failure and loss,...

00:53.292 --> 00:54.820
...we relish adversity.

00:56.893 --> 01:00.913
We are not afraid to take losses, to talk about our losses,...

01:01.466 --> 01:03.165
...to rebound from our losses.

01:04.004 --> 01:06.664
Those are our defining moments.

01:07.668 --> 01:11.068
Discipline and self-awareness are our companions.

01:13.007 --> 01:15.906
We are what you've always wished you could be.

01:18.091 --> 01:19.999
And we're coming out of the shadows.

01:24.207 --> 01:25.824
We are traders.
