WEBVTT

00:00.109 --> 00:02.713
So this is pretty much the spread for all four quarters.

00:02.825 --> 00:03.442
We're excited.

00:04.137 --> 00:04.517
Yeah.

00:04.589 --> 00:07.241
I've gotta tell you, this is very aggressive for...

00:07.345 --> 00:07.661
You think?

00:07.783 --> 00:08.468
...what we're trying to do.

00:08.543 --> 00:11.002
Yeah, you know, we had a tough quarter.

00:11.507 --> 00:12.745
Right, I understand.

00:12.863 --> 00:16.415
Now we're trying to amortize it from here to here.

00:16.510 --> 00:18.177
You know, the thing is I like it,...

00:18.321 --> 00:18.543
Right.

00:18.689 --> 00:19.977
...I just don't love it.

00:20.413 --> 00:21.590
Sure, sure, sure.

00:22.890 --> 00:23.565
I understand.

00:27.256 --> 00:28.349
Hey, by the way, it's good to see you.

00:29.201 --> 00:30.019
It's been a while, right?

00:30.447 --> 00:31.036
Long time, yeah.

00:31.395 --> 00:32.063
How is Maureen?

00:32.174 --> 00:32.690
She's good.

00:32.854 --> 00:36.387
She took the kids up to the mountains for the week.

00:36.595 --> 00:37.653
Nice. Camping?

00:38.324 --> 00:38.907
Car camping.

00:39.451 --> 00:40.557
Is there any other kind?

00:41.269 --> 00:41.778
Apparently not.

00:42.037 --> 00:43.404
Yeah. And Chris likes Saint Matthew's?

00:44.094 --> 00:45.253
Yeah, he loves it.

00:45.492 --> 00:46.548
Well, great school.

00:46.787 --> 00:48.211
Yeah, I know, he's having a good time.

00:51.155 --> 00:51.780
Let me ask you.

00:52.978 --> 00:54.358
Did you finally get rid of that rash?

00:56.395 --> 00:58.475
Yeah, it's clearing up.

00:59.513 --> 01:00.593
Good, good, good, good.

01:00.937 --> 01:03.765
Speaking of clearing up, let me clear up some of these numbers here for you.

01:04.903 --> 01:05.671
I'm listening.

01:07.601 --> 01:10.432
I think you will find that the bottom line makes a lot of sense.

01:11.194 --> 01:12.062
Now it does.
