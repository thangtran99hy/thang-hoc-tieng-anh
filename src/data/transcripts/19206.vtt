Mr. Tanaka, thank you for coming.

00:02.789 --> 00:03.155
Please.

00:06.414 --> 00:10.603
Well Maurice, I think you're going to be really happy with our new platform.

00:10.877 --> 00:12.699
I don't know, I looked at the numbers.

00:12.911 --> 00:16.129
Maurice, we both know they are great numbers.

00:16.452 --> 00:18.067
Well, they're okay.

00:18.479 --> 00:22.349
It's exactly the type of lift that your company needs, Maurice.

00:25.227 --> 00:27.579
Oh yeah, now we could use a lift.

00:28.184 --> 00:31.402
It's worked wonders for other departments, Maurice.

00:32.325 --> 00:32.876
Oh yeah?

00:33.387 --> 00:37.515
And Maurice, we'll put your team on top.

00:39.925 --> 00:40.688
Let's do it.

00:41.427 --> 00:43.869
Great choice, Maurice.

00:47.895 --> 00:49.083
Maurice.
