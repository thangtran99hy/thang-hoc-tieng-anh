What do you think of Malcolm Gladwell's theory...

00:04.451 --> 00:12.651
...that the years 1953 to 1955 were the perfect ones in which to be born for the computer revolution?

00:16.087 --> 00:19.437
Yeah, his book makes a lot of great points,...

00:20.653 --> 00:27.896
...that is that in all success stories, there are significant elements of luck and timing.

00:30.011 --> 00:33.703
You know, I wasn't the only kid born between 1953 and 1955.

00:35.250 --> 00:43.196
But absolutely, to be young and open-minded at a time when the microprocessor was invented.

00:43.305 --> 00:48.898
In my case, I have a friend, Paul Allen, who's more open-minded about hardware-type things.

00:49.629 --> 00:54.101
And he literally brought me the obscure article that talked about that first microprocessor and said,...

00:54.611 --> 00:56.983
..."You know, this is going to improve exponentially."

00:57.064 --> 00:58.129
"What does that mean?"

00:58.803 --> 01:02.779
And I said, well that means we can do anything we want.

01:03.201 --> 01:05.893
And then he was bugging me the rest of the time.

01:05.961 --> 01:09.597
Every time there'd be a new microprocessor he said, "Can we do something yet?"

01:10.051 --> 01:13.209
And when we were in high school, that didn't happen.

01:13.562 --> 01:16.333
So he came back to Boston, took a job there.

01:17.037 --> 01:23.721
Actually, the microprocessor that was finally good enough came out in early 1975...

01:23.833 --> 01:26.025
...and that's why I dropped out.

01:26.091 --> 01:28.078
So the timing was pretty important.

01:30.144 --> 01:31.817
Why didn't older people see it?

01:32.179 --> 01:34.449
Well, they weren't just open-minded.

01:34.857 --> 01:37.265
They didn't think about software as the key ingredient.

01:37.729 --> 01:44.235
Now, you know a lot of kids started doing software and it's not...

01:44.715 --> 01:48.692
If somebody reads the book to say that if you spend 10,000 hours doing something,...

01:48.785 --> 01:53.350
...you'll be super good at it, I don't think that's quite as simple as that.

01:53.615 --> 01:55.549
What you do is you do about 50 hours,...

01:56.064 --> 01:59.914
...and 90% dropped out because they don't like it or they're not good.

02:00.265 --> 02:02.739
You do another 50 hours and 90% dropped out.

02:02.818 --> 02:04.640
So there's this constant cycles.

02:05.035 --> 02:10.822
And you do have to be lucky enough but also fanatical enough to keep going.

02:11.183 --> 02:13.211
And so the person who makes it to 10,000 hours...

02:13.296 --> 02:16.213
...is not just somebody who's done it for 10,000 hours,...

02:16.592 --> 02:21.987
...there's somebody who've chosen and been chosen in many different times.

02:22.133 --> 02:29.352
And so all these magical things came together, including who I knew at that time.

02:29.431 --> 02:33.677
And I think that's very important.

02:33.797 --> 02:37.431
When you look at somebody who's good and say, "Could I do it like them?"

02:38.623 --> 02:41.787
They've gone through so many cycles that it may fool you, that,...

02:42.419 --> 02:48.537
"Yes, yes you could with the right luck, imagination and some talent."
