00:03.825 --> 00:06.191
I got something to talk to you about, which is how you greet people.

00:06.276 --> 00:10.596
Now, a lot of people don't know about the "hell zone" and I'm here to tell you the secret.

00:10.903 --> 00:13.452
Now, do you know where the "hell zone" is in your store?

00:14.141 --> 00:15.679
You're sure? No idea?

00:16.090 --> 00:16.610
Think about it.

00:16.919 --> 00:19.162
Where does your employee hate to be?

00:20.046 --> 00:22.023
Where do your customers hate to be?

00:23.467 --> 00:25.539
That's right, it's the first eight feet of your store.

00:25.853 --> 00:28.759
Customers don't want to go there because they know you're employees are gonna go up to them and say,...

00:28.985 --> 00:29.977
..."Hi, can I help you?"

00:30.191 --> 00:30.990
And then they're going to say what?

00:31.361 --> 00:33.446
"No, thank you," and leave and they'll never see him again.

00:34.183 --> 00:38.399
Employees don't want to go up there because they're gonna say, "Hi, can I help you?" to the customer,...

00:38.693 --> 00:40.679
...and they're gonna say, "No, just looking."

00:40.999 --> 00:44.062
...and they're going to retreat because they feel wounded.

00:44.436 --> 00:47.732
And they're gonna go back to the castle of the counter where they will never be seen again.

00:48.330 --> 00:50.987
Here's a way to get past that and it's really important for a gift store:...

00:51.499 --> 00:52.421
...find a prop.

00:53.097 --> 00:54.020
Now, a prop can be anything.

00:54.291 --> 00:55.589
In my case, I'm using my book...

00:55.981 --> 00:59.548
..."You Can Compete: Double Sales Without Discounting," shameless plug.

01:00.473 --> 01:01.524
But that's not the point.

01:02.141 --> 01:05.178
If I was here in a store and I can't move out of the frame here,...

01:05.494 --> 01:09.166
...but if a customer walked into my store,...

01:09.420 --> 01:12.677
...I would just walk over, I'd say, "Good morning, welcome to Bob's Gift Store."

01:12.847 --> 01:14.953
"Feel free to look around and I'll be right back."

01:15.173 --> 01:17.122
Now, by me having this prop in my hand,...

01:17.574 --> 01:20.204
...it looks like I have a reason to go past them.

01:20.484 --> 01:23.489
So it kind of looked like, "Good morning, welcome to Bob's Gift Store."

01:23.694 --> 01:25.554
"Feel free to look around and I'll be right back."

01:25.659 --> 01:28.718
And I would continue walking past them and the customer will be going this way.

01:29.231 --> 01:31.418
And I'll guarantee if you try this in your gift store today,...

01:31.793 --> 01:33.642
...you're gonna hear the customer say, "Thank you."

01:34.861 --> 01:35.702
Now, why do they say "thank you?"

01:36.000 --> 01:38.954
Because to their knowledge, you're moving on, there's something more important to do.

01:39.215 --> 01:43.159
They don't have to worry about you coming up and saying, "Can I help you?" and then having to decide.

01:43.855 --> 01:44.886
And it relaxes everybody.

01:45.511 --> 01:48.564
And then you can sit or stand over there and you can notice what they're picking up...

01:48.660 --> 01:50.401
...and then go back and have some more information.

01:50.985 --> 01:52.448
You can have some more talk with them.

01:52.807 --> 01:55.476
But the point is, a prop gives you the way to deal with the "hell zone."

01:55.862 --> 01:59.591
You greet them at about a 45 degree angle, letting them move past.

01:59.727 --> 02:01.726
Now, some of you are saying, "But what if they've got something?"

02:01.850 --> 02:03.941
Well, if they have a real need, they'll stop you.

02:04.254 --> 02:06.589
And they'll say "Can you help me, I'm looking for..." and that's great.

02:06.939 --> 02:08.761
But a lot of times, particularly in a gift store,...

02:09.119 --> 02:12.013
...we want people to feel free to look around, not be bothered,...

02:12.232 --> 02:15.307
...and then about two minutes later we may come back and have further information.

02:15.713 --> 02:19.393
So that's my tip for you here, always use a prop when greeting a customer.

02:19.755 --> 02:22.376
And thanks for joining me, Bob Phibbs, Retail Doctor.
