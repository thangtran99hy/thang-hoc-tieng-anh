00:05.385 --> 00:07.273
I have no idea when did it start.

00:10.368 --> 00:11.002
Who am I?

00:12.025 --> 00:12.816
Why am I here?

00:15.999 --> 00:20.899
I was diagnosed with tuberculosis meningitis, which complicated into hydrocephalus.

00:23.769 --> 00:26.753
And then, that's when I started forgetting things.

00:30.742 --> 00:33.676
I just remember waking up with no memory.

00:39.852 --> 00:41.599
I couldn't even recognize my own reflection.

00:42.430 --> 00:44.761
I had to get used to this idea that this is how I look.

00:46.323 --> 00:48.011
Absolutely nothing made sense.

00:49.226 --> 00:51.409
I had no idea what relationships meant,...

00:51.899 --> 00:54.879
...that you are my father, that she was my mother, this was my brother.

00:56.059 --> 00:59.531
I did not speak to anybody because I didn't recognize them,...

01:01.708 --> 01:02.737
...and I didn't know what to say.

01:06.039 --> 01:08.299
I lost 27 years of experiences.

01:14.427 --> 01:16.845
It's the past that makes you who you are, right?

01:17.688 --> 01:19.677
So, who am I?

01:27.739 --> 01:31.763
When I was well enough to use and work on a computer,...

01:31.991 --> 01:34.683
...I started browsing through my history list,....

01:34.945 --> 01:37.263
...and there was this website called Facebook on it.

01:37.912 --> 01:40.710
And then it suggested that these are the people you may know,...

01:41.685 --> 01:42.742
...and that's how it started.

01:52.427 --> 01:56.843
Memories : They're not lost; they're there somewhere.

01:58.624 --> 02:02.709
If I can recognize one thing, I can identify the pieces of the puzzle.

02:15.715 --> 02:17.278
Imagine if that too aren't there.

02:18.132 --> 02:20.260
How would I feel or connect with anything?

02:22.570 --> 02:24.241
That's how I've been building my whole life.
