How's that work?

00:03.759 --> 00:06.059
Who wants to lug around a big, heavy suitcase?

00:06.887 --> 00:08.935
Well, there's a new product concept out there...

00:09.028 --> 00:10.761
...that may replace your old suitcase.

00:11.143 --> 00:13.401
Dubbed "Hop, The Following Suitcase,"...

00:13.595 --> 00:15.716
...the luggage piece essentially follows its owner.

00:16.543 --> 00:19.209
The suitcase reportedly utilizes a Bluetooth signal...

00:19.333 --> 00:21.057
...that is hooked up to the owner's cell phone.

00:21.493 --> 00:22.809
As the individual walks,...

00:22.951 --> 00:26.145
...the suitcase trails after the person using the cell phone signals.

00:26.747 --> 00:27.753
The inventor states...

00:27.886 --> 00:31.774
..."A microcontroller operates a caterpillar system based on compressed air,..."

00:31.944 --> 00:34.205
"...which follows the user at a constant distance."

00:35.211 --> 00:38.065
As a nice security feature, if the phone loses signal,...

00:38.212 --> 00:42.151
...the piece of luggage will automatically lock and vibrate the phone to alert the owner.

00:43.041 --> 00:44.229
According to the designer,...

00:44.368 --> 00:48.723
..."With current technology that is present today in lawn mowers or automatic vacuum cleaners,..."

00:48.869 --> 00:51.209
"...a suitcase can embed the function of a bellhop."

00:52.096 --> 00:55.892
While it may take some time for the moving suitcase to become commercially available,...

00:56.059 --> 00:59.535
...many fliers can appreciate not being bogged down by heavy luggage.

01:00.263 --> 01:01.255
Would you want to use it?
