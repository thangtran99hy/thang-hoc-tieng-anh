Hi! I'm Naomi, and I'm very excited to show you the world's greatest attractions.

00:10.358 --> 00:12.811
The Kansas City Library Parking Garage,...

00:12.928 --> 00:15.897
...located in the heart of downtown Kansas City, Missouri,...

00:15.991 --> 00:19.055
...signifies extraordinary architectural design.

00:20.411 --> 00:23.051
It was built to rejuvenate the metropolis area...

00:23.135 --> 00:28.432
...and encourage residents young and old alike to take advantage of its books and further knowledge.

00:29.141 --> 00:34.164
The exterior portrays book bindings of several of the world's most famous writings...

00:34.333 --> 00:36.323
...made to depict a large bookshelf.

00:37.578 --> 00:42.889
The building stands approximately 25 feet tall and each book is nine feet in width.

00:44.655 --> 00:46.629
There are 22 books in total,...

00:46.981 --> 00:50.347
...the widely ranged titles chosen by Kansas City citizens...

00:50.473 --> 00:53.267
...for an entirely personified approach to design.

00:54.594 --> 00:57.307
Thank you for watching our travel video series.

00:57.547 --> 00:58.545
See you next time.
