00:00.215 --> 00:01.044
Tell me about yourself.

00:01.356 --> 00:03.547
It's often the first question in a job interview...

00:03.772 --> 00:05.814
...and one of the most difficult to answer.

00:06.025 --> 00:08.611
Just because it's an open-ended question doesn't mean...

00:08.739 --> 00:10.185
...there aren't any wrong answers.

00:10.537 --> 00:13.295
The first trap to avoid is asking "What do you want to know?"

00:13.561 --> 00:15.634
It might be tempting to ask for clarification.

00:16.001 --> 00:16.257
Don't.

00:16.795 --> 00:18.886
Another misconception is that the interviewer...

00:18.982 --> 00:20.568
...is asking about your personal life.

00:20.821 --> 00:22.741
You're not being asked to discuss your childhood,...

00:22.869 --> 00:24.338
...your political or religious beliefs...

00:24.514 --> 00:26.170
...or how you're managing a medical crisis.

00:26.339 --> 00:28.780
Leave these personal details out of your answer.

00:29.437 --> 00:31.024
How should you answer the question?

00:31.241 --> 00:33.450
Use recent work experiences to show...

00:33.607 --> 00:35.604
...why you'll be good at the job you're applying for.

00:36.190 --> 00:36.760
Be brief.

00:37.004 --> 00:38.142
Don't take more than a minute.

00:38.481 --> 00:40.877
And most importantly, rehearse your answer.

00:41.115 --> 00:43.093
Practice speaking your answer over and over...

00:43.251 --> 00:44.559
...so you can repeat it naturally,...

00:44.966 --> 00:46.639
...even under the stress of an interview.

00:47.311 --> 00:49.617
Tell me about yourself is a vague question,...

00:49.902 --> 00:53.736
...but having a concise answer can get your interview off to a great start.
