Writing letters to Santa Claus just got a Web 2.0 upgrade this holiday season.

00:04.677 --> 00:07.751
This is called "All I Want from Santa", it's an application.

00:08.212 --> 00:11.255
Once you have your child registered, you create a wish list;...

00:11.435 --> 00:14.797
...for instance, my son, he would like a remote-controlled monster truck.

00:14.922 --> 00:17.774
You type in your wish list, you can alter it if you need to,...

00:18.268 --> 00:19.974
...and then you can send it straight to Santa.

00:20.561 --> 00:22.606
It's a new software application for your phone.

00:22.719 --> 00:25.488
Users can let their children type in their wish lists...

00:25.837 --> 00:27.594
...and go back to update them if necessary,...

00:27.885 --> 00:31.271
...then mom or dad can send it on to Santa like a gift registry,...

00:31.622 --> 00:34.904
...or children can type a letter to Santa in their own words if they want to.

00:35.208 --> 00:41.701
Also, it has a countdown till Christmas, so I'm on the main screen, here you can see 24 days till Christmas.

00:42.004 --> 00:44.910
Some parents say it could make their Christmas season a little easier,...

00:45.293 --> 00:47.507
...but Santa says it's just a tool he's using.

00:47.823 --> 00:50.455
It doesn't replace his one-on-one time with children.

00:51.022 --> 00:57.019
Well, I doubt that it could because that can't create the interpersonal magic...

00:57.553 --> 01:00.539
...that occurs when a child looks at Santa.

01:00.853 --> 01:01.839
A doll.

01:02.136 --> 01:02.875
A doll?

01:03.808 --> 01:09.899
Each letter and list is archived, so the messages to Santa will be available long after the Christmas season ends.

01:10.306 --> 01:12.273
