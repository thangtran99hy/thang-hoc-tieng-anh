When I ask people in Hamilton, "What is culture?"

00:02.836 --> 00:04.504
I get a lot of different answers.

00:04.993 --> 00:06.206
But what is it really?

00:06.356 --> 00:07.299
What is its value?

00:07.448 --> 00:08.708
And why does it matter?

00:09.061 --> 00:10.276
So, where to start?

00:10.367 --> 00:11.478
I live in this city.

00:11.843 --> 00:16.510
It has roads, clean water, electricity, police stations, hospitals, schools,...

00:16.602 --> 00:18.018
...but every city has these.

00:18.145 --> 00:19.719
What makes Hamilton different?

00:19.872 --> 00:22.222
Well, this could be where culture comes in.

00:22.376 --> 00:26.659
Let's see: festivals and events, a thriving art scene,...

00:27.292 --> 00:31.231
...stories and customs, a sense of history,...

00:32.167 --> 00:35.300
...cool architecture, creative talent, public art,...

00:35.391 --> 00:39.276
...and even outdoor places like parks, farms and waterfalls.

00:39.401 --> 00:41.941
These are all considered to be part of culture.

00:42.170 --> 00:44.704
All of these things create activity and buzz,...

00:44.809 --> 00:47.514
...a positive energy known as cultural vibrancy.

00:47.615 --> 00:50.231
And this vibrancy helps to build community,..

00:50.465 --> 00:51.651
...define neighborhoods,...

00:51.798 --> 00:54.754
...and make the place we live in have a unique identity.

00:54.986 --> 00:56.589
It also leads to attachment.

00:56.751 --> 00:59.443
People that are attached to Hamilton want to live here.

00:59.589 --> 01:01.937
They get involved, and they talk about it.

01:02.043 --> 01:05.098
As the word spreads, people come, and businesses too.

01:05.281 --> 01:08.065
This attracts more people and then more businesses.

01:08.183 --> 01:10.297
Creative talent is drawn to Hamilton,...

01:10.458 --> 01:13.807
...and is already one-third of the labor force and growing.

01:13.997 --> 01:16.399
I guess you could say that culture is all the things...

01:16.467 --> 01:19.412
...that make life in a place meaningful and interesting.

01:19.654 --> 01:25.018
It's valuable because it can promote identity, creativity, tourism, jobs, and growth,...

01:25.494 --> 01:28.655
...and it matters because it contributes to quality of life,...

01:28.891 --> 01:30.857
...creating attraction and attachment,...

01:30.940 --> 01:34.126
...revitalizing neighborhoods, transforming cities,...

01:34.189 --> 01:38.798
...and making communities attractive, open, welcoming, and vibrant.

01:39.343 --> 01:43.736
So, if you take away culture, then what do we have left?

01:44.903 --> 01:45.738
Get culture.

01:46.056 --> 01:47.073
Love your city.
