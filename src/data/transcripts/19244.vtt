They say that life is better here in the Philippines,...

00:03.613 --> 00:06.689
...and on Boracay, it's certainly easy to see why.

00:07.151 --> 00:10.451
We have amazing resorts, fantastic food,...

00:10.691 --> 00:13.437
...and some of the friendliest people you'll find anywhere.

00:13.678 --> 00:15.159
Mabuhay!

00:15.243 --> 00:18.059
But why show you that when I can show you this.

00:18.142 --> 00:21.807
Along the white beach of Boracay, you'll find hundreds of tour operators.

00:22.254 --> 00:24.149
Picking one or the other really doesn't matter...

00:24.223 --> 00:26.530
...since they essentially take you to the same place.

00:26.919 --> 00:28.895
Today, Jo and I hopped aboard a speedboat,...

00:29.215 --> 00:31.727
...and before we knew it, we were hoisted up into the air,...

00:31.825 --> 00:34.602
...soaring above the sea more than 100 feet,...

00:34.931 --> 00:37.351
...taking in Boracay's spectacular views.

00:40.333 --> 00:42.701
Our next adventure also had us harnessed in...

00:42.777 --> 00:46.041
...as we soar through the treetops on a fantastic zip line.

00:58.849 --> 01:03.400
But by far one of the most memorable experiences we had was at zorb park.

01:03.812 --> 01:08.675
Imagine being placed inside a giant rubber ball and then being pushed down the hill.

01:09.031 --> 01:10.965
That's exactly what you'll find here.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.664
Now, there are two options: the dry and the wet.

01:13.756 --> 01:18.135
And for my money, the most fun you can have is inside the wet zorb ball.

01:28.816 --> 01:32.540
As a tropical paradise, Boracay has some amazing dives.

01:32.913 --> 01:36.803
Dive gurus on station number three operates about five dives per day.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.078
If you don't have any gear, don't worry.

01:39.203 --> 01:41.468
They can rent it out to you for very cheap.

01:41.909 --> 01:45.969
If you're not a certified diver, they also have classes running at your convenience...

01:46.045 --> 01:49.408
Where you can become a certified scuba diver in as little as three days.

01:49.900 --> 01:51.297
The diving is fantastic,...

01:51.415 --> 01:54.395
...allowing you to get close to corals and fish.

01:55.781 --> 01:56.624
So there you have it.

01:56.707 --> 01:59.801
Some awesome activities here in Boracay.

01:59.875 --> 02:01.193
Thank you very much for watching.

02:01.848 --> 02:02.963
I'll see you next time.
