00:05.503 --> 00:08.851
We know Tony is gonna fight bad guys and robots and that kind of thing,...

00:08.937 --> 00:10.825
...but what's his internal struggle this time around?

00:14.515 --> 00:17.578
We are not as serious as the Dark Knight...

00:17.802 --> 00:22.295
...but Tony definitely has, and always has historically in the comic books,...

00:22.359 --> 00:24.935
...even more so, his inner demons.

00:25.270 --> 00:26.707
We did a little of that in Iron Man 2,...

00:26.831 --> 00:29.168
...but if you think about someone who saw the skies open up...

00:29.635 --> 00:34.057
...and came through a wormhole and fought off alien species,...

00:34.658 --> 00:36.542
...suffice to say he's a little rattled.

00:37.313 --> 00:40.419
Robert, we heard that you're signed up to do a big stunt...

00:40.514 --> 00:43.319
...where you're going to be running across some major high point.

00:43.415 --> 00:44.959
Are you giving Tom Cruise a run for his money here?

00:45.323 --> 00:46.143
Oh, well I don't know.

00:46.225 --> 00:51.664
I just said while I'm still physically able, I'd like to leave it all on the field.

00:51.845 --> 00:54.589
And I would like there to be ten moments where people wonder...

00:55.030 --> 00:58.044
...how I was stupid enough to actually do that stunt, most of all me.

00:58.620 --> 01:01.094
What is Rhodes's relationship with Tony in this film?

01:01.192 --> 01:02.307
Are they on good terms now?

01:04.440 --> 01:06.685
They kind of kissed and made up at the end of Iron Man 2...

01:06.789 --> 01:08.351
...and this one starts off with him.

01:08.593 --> 01:15.642
There's still some, there's always this underlying sort of competitiveness and suit envy...

01:15.723 --> 01:17.443
...between both of them which is kind of fun.

01:18.079 --> 01:21.065
As Shane is fond of saying, they're kind of two Iron Men,...

01:21.201 --> 01:24.817
...one of them who's private sector Iron Man and the other one is this military Iron Man...

01:24.889 --> 01:28.299
...and what's their jurisdiction and where's the overlap happening...

01:28.404 --> 01:29.489
...how does it make each of them feel.

01:29.576 --> 01:31.980
So a lot more of that gets looked into in this film.
