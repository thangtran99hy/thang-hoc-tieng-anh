One of the funny things about owning a brain...

00:15.842 --> 00:19.329
...is that you have no control over the things that it gathers and holds on to,...

00:19.411 --> 00:20.857
...the facts and the stories.

00:20.913 --> 00:22.649
And as you get older, it only gets worse.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.400
Things stick around for years sometimes before you understand why you're interested in them,...

00:27.450 --> 00:29.135
...before you understand their import to you.

00:29.485 --> 00:30.399
Here's three of mine.

00:31.007 --> 00:34.095
When Richard Feynman was a young boy in Queens,...

00:34.358 --> 00:37.511
...he went for a walk with his dad and his wagon and a ball.

00:38.031 --> 00:40.978
And he noticed that when he pulled the wagon, the ball went to the back of the wagon.

00:41.038 --> 00:43.606
And he asked his dad, "Why does the ball go to the back of the wagon?"

00:43.664 --> 00:45.890
And his dad said, "That's inertia."

00:46.223 --> 00:47.517
He said, "What's inertia?"
