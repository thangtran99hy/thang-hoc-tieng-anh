I know you're not as quick as a vampire, but how quick are you at your multiple choice?

00:04.047 --> 00:04.950
So do an either or.

00:05.013 --> 00:05.463
Not quick.

00:05.700 --> 00:06.305
Are you ready?

00:06.855 --> 00:09.100
Christmas shopping, sorted or the last minute?

00:09.586 --> 00:10.051
Last minute.

00:10.278 --> 00:12.920
Christmas present, like the surprise or need to know?

00:14.814 --> 00:15.503
Like the surprise.

00:15.831 --> 00:18.023
Christmas Eve, family and friends...

00:18.211 --> 00:20.830
...or friends outside, big night out?

00:21.774 --> 00:22.605
Family and friends.

00:23.083 --> 00:23.523
Okay.

00:23.663 --> 00:24.722
I mean Christmas is...

00:25.318 --> 00:26.572
Pecan or pumpkin pie?

00:27.251 --> 00:27.564
Pecan.

00:28.198 --> 00:29.997
Hollywood smile or British gnashes?

00:31.833 --> 00:32.767
What's a gnash?

00:32.905 --> 00:33.978
Gnashes are your teeth!

00:34.522 --> 00:34.804
Oh!

00:35.045 --> 00:37.751
We apparently have really bad teeth compared to Americans.

00:38.423 --> 00:40.181
British gnash, people sometimes say that I have buckteeth,...

00:40.246 --> 00:41.817
...I grew up with rabbit teeth.

00:44.486 --> 00:45.517
So yeah, British gnashes.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.768
High street or high fashion?

00:49.067 --> 00:49.789
What's high street?

00:50.139 --> 00:51.639
High street, you know, like rags.

00:52.669 --> 00:54.557
Seriously, I like vintage rags.

00:55.344 --> 00:56.807
Really, you like your vintage shopping?

00:56.967 --> 01:01.834
Yeah, I'm much more comfortable in old clothes that had been worn by other people for many years.

01:02.087 --> 01:05.821
So if I'm in a perfect date movie, "Twilight" or "Four Christmases"?

01:06.934 --> 01:07.378
"Twilight"?

01:07.920 --> 01:10.024
I think I would get in a lot of trouble if I said the other.
