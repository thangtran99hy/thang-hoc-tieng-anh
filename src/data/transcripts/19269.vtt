00:11.270 --> 00:13.685
Welcome aboard this Air Middle-earth flight.

00:14.324 --> 00:18.816
Before we set out on our journey, I would like to impart a story of safety.

00:22.804 --> 00:26.503
Even if you fly with us often, be sure to keep a sharp eye on the briefing.

00:26.660 --> 00:31.409
Make sure your belongings are hidden away in the compartments above or under the seat before you.

00:33.127 --> 00:38.421
All travelers must keep a watchful eye on the lighted signs and follow crew instructions.

00:38.549 --> 00:42.955
If the seat belt sign is on, sit yourself down and fasten your seat belt quick smart.

00:43.194 --> 00:47.154
Be sure that it's snug across your hips, but not so tight as to lose the feeling in your legs.

00:47.323 --> 00:51.291
If you're in the Skycouch row, there are special seat belt instructions in your seat pocket.

00:51.394 --> 00:54.241
We recommend keeping your seat belt fastened throughout the journey.

00:54.317 --> 00:56.762
Should you need to explore, it can always be undone.

01:04.997 --> 01:09.435
If an oxygen mask should fall before you, simply pull down on the mask, place over your nose and mouth...

01:09.523 --> 01:12.198
...and tighten by pulling the elastics on both sides.

01:12.290 --> 01:14.785
Oxygen will flow through the mask automatically.

01:14.946 --> 01:18.427
If there are young ones around you, be sure to put your mask on before helping them.

01:18.535 --> 01:21.201
Keep a sharp eye as there may be others who need your help.

01:21.275 --> 01:21.968
Mordor.

01:22.085 --> 01:23.257
Mordor.

01:23.397 --> 01:24.161
Mordor.

01:24.273 --> 01:24.731
Mordor.

01:26.329 --> 01:29.349
Should an emergency occur during takeoff or landing, place your hands on your head,...

01:29.437 --> 01:32.435
...with your elbows on the outside of your thighs, whilst keeping your feet flat on the floor.

01:32.616 --> 01:34.437
You can also brace yourself on the seat in front of you.

01:40.171 --> 01:41.273
My precious.
