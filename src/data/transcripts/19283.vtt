Far to the east, over ranges and rivers, lies a single, solitary peak.

00:14.245 --> 00:16.566
The dwarves are determined to reclaim their homeland.

00:19.843 --> 00:22.297
I like visitors as much as the next hobbit.

00:23.429 --> 00:26.231
But I do like to know them before they come visiting.

00:26.308 --> 00:26.996
Mr. Baggins.

00:27.133 --> 00:28.318
At your service.

00:29.355 --> 00:30.871
I'm surrounded by dwarves.

00:31.045 --> 00:31.833
What are they doing here?

00:31.993 --> 00:33.804
Oh, they're quite a merry gathering.

00:35.227 --> 00:36.825
So, this is the Hobbit.

00:37.243 --> 00:41.747
You asked me to find the 14th member of this company and I have chosen Mr. Baggins.

00:42.004 --> 00:43.099
Me? No. No, no, no.

00:43.190 --> 00:48.527
Hobbits can pass unseen by most if they choose, which gives us a distinct advantage.

00:48.736 --> 00:51.251
We will seize this chance to take back Erebor!

00:52.265 --> 00:53.413
You! Mr. Bilbo!

00:53.689 --> 00:54.601
Where are you off to?

00:54.683 --> 00:56.517
I'm going on an adventure!

00:58.517 --> 01:00.683
Mithrandir, why the halfling?

01:01.089 --> 01:02.819
Why Bilbo Baggins?

01:03.941 --> 01:05.487
Perhaps it is because I'm afraid...

01:07.581 --> 01:09.124
...and he gives me courage.

01:13.276 --> 01:16.467
So this is your purpose: to enter the mountain.

01:16.740 --> 01:17.377
What of it?

01:17.830 --> 01:20.538
There are some who would not deem it wise.

01:22.072 --> 01:26.080
A dark part has found a way back into the world.

01:28.011 --> 01:30.402
Why don't we have a game of riddles.

01:30.634 --> 01:32.969
And if it loses, what then?

01:33.745 --> 01:37.319
Well, if it loses, Precious, then we eat it.

01:38.519 --> 01:41.521
If Baggins loses, we eat it whole.

01:44.074 --> 01:44.438
Fair enough.

01:50.351 --> 01:53.479
I will take each and every one of these dwarves over the mightiest army.

01:57.956 --> 02:02.495
Loyalty, honor, a willing heart.

02:03.002 --> 02:04.398
I can ask no more than that.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.566
Home is now behind you.

02:10.847 --> 02:12.581
The world is ahead.

02:22.160 --> 02:23.214
Well, that could have been worse.

02:26.205 --> 02:28.837
You've got to be joking!
