00:03.146 --> 00:06.082
South Korea's presidential race has officially started...

00:06.201 --> 00:10.703
...as presidential hopefuls registered their candidacies for the December 19th election.

00:11.025 --> 00:15.832
With less than a month away, South Korea's presidential candidates kicked off their official campaigns.

00:16.051 --> 00:20.958
Nominees from the ruling and main opposition party are expected to dominate this year's elections...

00:21.206 --> 00:25.157
...with Park Geun-hye of the ruling New Frontier Party currently leading all candidates.

00:25.540 --> 00:28.531
Park, who is aiming to be South Korea's first female president,...

00:28.850 --> 00:31.949
...vowed to completely step out of politics if not elected.

00:32.713 --> 00:35.819
Moon Jae-in, the main opposition Democratic United Party candidate,...

00:36.093 --> 00:38.973
...served as a chief of staff to former President Roh Moo-hyun.

00:39.437 --> 00:44.977
Moon and Park Geun-hye have a history as Moon was jailed for leading protests against Park's father, Park Chung-hee,...

00:45.142 --> 00:47.035
...who ruled the country for 18 years.

00:48.962 --> 00:52.527
I, Moon Jae-in, will be the first president to open the new era.

00:53.219 --> 00:56.553
Today, the official 18th presidential election has started.

00:57.069 --> 01:01.731
This election will determine not only the next five years, but the next 10 to 20 years...

01:02.113 --> 01:06.466
...as to whether South Korea will move into the future or go back into the past.

01:08.695 --> 01:11.559
Moon's nomination comes at the expense of Ahn Cheol-soo,...

01:11.730 --> 01:16.659
...who unexpectedly withdrew from the presidential race last week in fear of splitting the liberal vote,...

01:16.869 --> 01:19.191
...which would guarantee an easy victory for Park.

01:19.597 --> 01:21.854
Many however, still believe in Ahn's politics,...

01:22.148 --> 01:25.913
...especially to voters who are tired of outdated conventional parties.

01:27.436 --> 01:28.818
One thing is still lacking:...

01:28.979 --> 01:34.823
...the reform of South Korean politics and the Democratic United Party that Ahn Cheol-soo represented.

01:35.278 --> 01:37.203
We should fire that flag up again.

01:37.713 --> 01:42.117
The combination of Moon, the representative of the Democratic United Party's government...

01:42.484 --> 01:45.713
...and Ahn Cheol-soo is a strategy for certain victory.

01:47.481 --> 01:51.135
While polls are showing that the backlash of Ahn's withdrawal mostly hurts Moon,...

01:51.428 --> 01:54.493
...analysts say it negatively affects both major candidates.

01:55.809 --> 01:58.411
To an extent, we now have a unified candidate.

01:58.873 --> 02:03.693
Park Geun-hye and her party didn't want this as they hoped for a three-way competition.

02:04.162 --> 02:09.657
And although Moon is now the unified candidate, the merger process also wasn't ideal for him.

02:10.175 --> 02:15.387
Ahn one-sidedly gave up his candidacy without mutual consent or negotiations,...

02:15.779 --> 02:17.684
...not achieving a synergy effect.

02:19.105 --> 02:24.012
Still, Ahn Cheol-soo's supporters, which poll shows to make up one-third of eligible voters,...

02:24.308 --> 02:27.632
...are now the deciding factor in an uncertain presidential race.

02:29.178 --> 02:33.729
The media has reported that 20 percent of Ahn supporters now support Park,...

02:34.182 --> 02:36.219
...and less than 50 percent back Moon.

02:36.728 --> 02:40.000
However, I think currently Ahn's supporters are in shock...

02:40.234 --> 02:43.131
...and in a state which they can't decide whom to vote for.

02:44.966 --> 02:47.308
Both candidates will need to rally the undecided...

02:47.636 --> 02:51.287
...despite the challenge of swaying voters who oppose traditional politics.

02:51.613 --> 02:53.757
