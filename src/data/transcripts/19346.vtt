00:00.385 --> 00:00.924
A beauty, huh?

00:01.137 --> 00:01.721
It's dependable.

00:01.859 --> 00:02.662
Long-lasting, too.

00:02.758 --> 00:04.499
Yeah, I could really use a silver auto.

00:04.627 --> 00:05.285
I'm a big hunter.

00:05.430 --> 00:06.075
Oh, what do you hunt?

00:06.241 --> 00:06.677
Deer.

00:07.959 --> 00:08.517
Fish.

00:09.538 --> 00:10.193
I hunt fish.

00:10.515 --> 00:11.599
How's that work exactly?

00:12.314 --> 00:18.605
Just put a bunch of camouflage on and just look in the water,...

00:19.063 --> 00:23.295
...walk around the stream or the river.

00:23.451 --> 00:25.523
I saw a catfish the other day.

00:26.541 --> 00:27.833
Hunted them real good.

00:30.005 --> 00:38.899
Then, I just write down what I hunted and log it in my hunting booklet.

00:40.307 --> 00:44.697
I'm part of the Hunting Fish Organization, the HFO.

00:46.370 --> 00:46.938
I haven't heard of that.

00:47.688 --> 00:48.750
Yeah, we're new.

00:49.139 --> 00:49.996
It's just me.

00:54.653 --> 00:57.895
I just said deer for no reason,...

00:58.380 --> 00:59.566
...but I meant fish.
