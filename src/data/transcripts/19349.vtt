My biggest tips for an entrepreneur would be to differentiate yourself.

00:03.933 --> 00:06.387
Why are you different? What's important about you?

00:06.497 --> 00:07.870
Why does the customer need you?

00:08.167 --> 00:11.562
And really have that really rehearsed and ready to go.

00:11.619 --> 00:14.372
You got to visualize where you are headed and be very clear about it.

00:14.478 --> 00:17.741
Take a Polaroid picture of where you're gonna be in a few years.

00:17.817 --> 00:23.060
You've got to trust your gut even through the process of being able to afford advisers...

00:23.143 --> 00:25.110
...and people with all this experience.

00:25.203 --> 00:27.411
Still, check in with your gut along the way.

00:27.712 --> 00:29.603
It's very important to be authentic,...

00:29.855 --> 00:33.755
...and to be truly who you are from the beginning, all through the process.

00:33.848 --> 00:35.396
The consumer will react to that;...

00:35.579 --> 00:36.824
...treating people kindly...

00:36.921 --> 00:39.408
...and being fair throughout the process,...

00:39.544 --> 00:44.569
I believe in karma in business and it's really worked out for us here at Spanx.

00:44.775 --> 00:48.009
I also think you should embrace what you don't know especially in the beginning...

00:48.072 --> 00:50.805
...because what you don't know can become your greatest asset.

00:50.971 --> 00:54.988
It ensures that you'll absolutely be doing things different from everybody else.

00:55.225 --> 01:00.631
Don't solicit feedback on your product, your idea or your business just for validation purposes.

01:00.758 --> 01:01.979
Be really careful about that.

01:02.315 --> 01:05.028
You want to tell the people that can help move your idea forward.

01:05.415 --> 01:09.272
But if you're just looking to your friend, co-worker, husband, wife for validation,...

01:09.630 --> 01:14.325
...be careful because out of love and concern, a lot of people will express some concerns,...

01:14.693 --> 01:19.581
...and it can stop a lot of multimillion-dollar ideas right in their tracks in the beginning.
