00:00.775 --> 00:01.885
My dear friends.

00:06.019 --> 00:10.303
You have honored me this evening to a degree I feel I don't yet deserve.

00:11.546 --> 00:20.223
When I read about the work of my fellow honorees, I felt humbled and certain that among us, I am the one with much to prove.

00:21.504 --> 00:27.528
I believe I have received this award not so much because of what I've done, but because of the way I was born and raised.

00:28.231 --> 00:32.099
I was born the younger sister of a gay man, my older brother Mike,...

00:32.460 --> 00:37.829
...and the daughter of parents who were both empathetic to and loving of the LGBT community.

00:38.774 --> 00:42.894
In my household, being gay was, and is, no big deal.

00:43.941 --> 00:47.964
When my brother came out, we hugged him, said we loved him, and that was that.

00:49.105 --> 00:50.820
When he brought home his first boyfriend,...

00:57.800 --> 01:03.192
...when he brought his first boyfriend, now husband, home for a couple of weeks one Christmas,...

01:03.627 --> 01:05.809
...my father's only comment to my mother was,...

01:06.581 --> 01:07.501
..."Please."

01:09.012 --> 01:10.667
"Try not to mix up our underwear."

01:18.809 --> 01:22.745
We had no idea that I would become recognizable because of my work...

01:23.356 --> 01:28.921
...and that we would become publicly labeled as having an "alternative family lifestyle."

01:30.055 --> 01:34.616
Just for the record, we don't feel that there is actually anything "alternative" about our family values.

01:43.611 --> 01:52.200
So for semantic reasons only, it's with some hesitation that I accept the HRC Ally Award.

01:52.752 --> 01:58.258
I don't consider myself just an ally to the LGBT community, I consider myself your family.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.371
And so, I'm doing what we should all do with our families.

02:07.001 --> 02:09.065
I'm loving you, I support you.

02:09.774 --> 02:12.998
I completely accept you as you are, as I hope you do me.

02:13.679 --> 02:18.476
And if anyone ever tries to hurt you, I'm gonna give them hell.

02:24.131 --> 02:26.324
There are many people who, did I just say many?

02:26.395 --> 02:27.394
That's such a jerk thing to say.

02:27.469 --> 02:33.740
There are people who have said that that I'm being brave for being openly supportive of gay marriage,...

02:33.811 --> 02:39.811
... gay adoption, basically of gay rights, but with all due respect, I humbly dissent.

02:40.549 --> 02:42.996
I'm not being brave, I'm being a decent human being.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.187
And I don't think I should receive an award for that.

02:51.741 --> 02:53.868
Or for merely stating what I believe to be true:...

02:54.431 --> 02:58.935
...that love is a human experience, not a political statement.

02:59.950 --> 03:04.234
However, I acknowledge that sadly, we live in a world where not everybody feels the same.

03:05.769 --> 03:10.480
My family and I will help the good fight continue until that long awaited moment arrives:...

03:10.905 --> 03:15.088
...when our rights are equal and when the political limits on love have been smashed.

03:16.300 --> 03:17.185
This award does not,...

03:21.403 --> 03:26.761
...this award does not in any way represent the pinnacle of my relationship with the LGBT community.

03:27.443 --> 03:32.817
Rather, it is a triumphant roar to announce that we are just beginning our fight together.

03:40.066 --> 03:47.445
In closing, to paraphrase Ennis Del Mar who was unforgettably embodied by the late, the great, Heath Ledger,...

03:48.370 --> 03:53.785
...I swear HRC, I swear, I have not yet done enough to deserve this award.

03:53.925 --> 03:56.149
But don't worry, the best is yet to come.

03:56.661 --> 03:59.649
Thank you so much, really thank you from the bottom of my heart.

03:59.925 --> 04:02.413
I love you all, thank you so much.

04:02.539 --> 04:03.323
Kiss each other!
