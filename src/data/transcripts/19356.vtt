00:13.986 --> 00:14.753
I love you.

00:25.203 --> 00:25.951
Hey.

00:33.838 --> 00:35.661
How many were there before me?

00:37.095 --> 00:38.185
What do you mean?

00:42.885 --> 00:47.253
Like how many girls did you love before me?

00:49.085 --> 00:49.835
Love?

00:54.913 --> 00:55.711
Five.

00:57.495 --> 00:59.011
I loved five women before you.

01:03.117 --> 01:04.404
What are their names?

01:07.912 --> 01:11.994
Who, what, when, where, why.

01:16.527 --> 01:18.061
Can you tell me about them?

01:23.885 --> 01:26.742
Who I loved was a girl from college.

01:27.766 --> 01:29.676
I wasn't exactly close to her but...

01:30.045 --> 01:33.631
...with some superficial facts and a few interactions over semester...

01:34.421 --> 01:37.371
...like most guys fantasizing over a girl they barely know.

01:37.975 --> 01:40.978
I filled in the blanks like a fairy tale author.

01:41.724 --> 01:45.705
And who she became in my head was probably more than the reality.

01:46.539 --> 01:49.749
She was a third year, sorority girl.

01:50.505 --> 01:50.767
Yeah!

01:51.065 --> 01:56.879
And I was the infatuated freshman, sure, but the several times we got to spend together outside of class...

01:57.459 --> 02:01.849
...It really allowed me to see, she also had a good heart and a bright spirit.

02:02.784 --> 02:06.167
The only problem was, so did just about every other guy.

02:07.447 --> 02:09.258
And while she turned me down nicely,...

02:10.497 --> 02:14.842
...I swear, there were times when it seemed like the cliche sorority girl...

02:15.494 --> 02:18.799
...may have felt something for the typical awkward freshman.
