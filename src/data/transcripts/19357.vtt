New Year's resolutions.

00:05.123 --> 00:05.759
Oh, hi!

00:05.967 --> 00:11.220
I'm Teri and in this segment, we're going to be talking about how to make a New Year's resolution.

00:11.913 --> 00:13.700
It's about that time of year again, folks,...

00:14.159 --> 00:18.097
...and we've got to start making our New Year's resolution lists.

00:18.595 --> 00:22.030
So what I recommend, first of all, is take out a piece of paper and a pen...

00:23.057 --> 00:28.353
...and write down all the things that you would like to change about yourself or your situation.

00:29.459 --> 00:37.578
So whether it be a financial goal, a physical goal, a spiritual goal, choose one thing.

00:38.464 --> 00:40.485
Or you could choose one from each category.

00:40.849 --> 00:43.853
The big thing is you don't wanna have ten or fifteen goals.

00:43.956 --> 00:45.200
It's a little overwhelming.

00:45.913 --> 00:48.392
Get through one goal and then focus on the next one.

00:49.365 --> 00:53.772
So, write out a list of all the different things that you wanna change...

00:54.464 --> 00:58.087
...and choose one and make sure it's realistic.

00:58.178 --> 01:01.008
That's the number one thing I can tell you: be realistic.

01:01.133 --> 01:04.711
If you want to lose weight, don't go with an unrealistic amount,...

01:05.086 --> 01:08.541
...you know, maybe say, "I want to lose ten pounds" or "I want to lose twenty pounds."

01:09.681 --> 01:11.754
And start with that goal and then go from there.

01:12.510 --> 01:14.092
You want to break down your objectives.

01:14.161 --> 01:16.258
So let's say eventually you want to lose a hundred pounds.

01:16.333 --> 01:21.427
Start with ten or twenty so that you can see your progress happening.

01:22.513 --> 01:24.749
Also, do something that's going to make you feel good,...

01:24.829 --> 01:27.311
...something that you can imagine would make your life better.

01:28.658 --> 01:29.939
So, those are a couple of hints.

01:30.650 --> 01:32.620
You know, if it's a bad habit or something,...

01:34.121 --> 01:36.387
...choose something that you want to just get rid of in your life...

01:36.460 --> 01:40.347
...and you will feel so good about making this resolution that it'll have to stick.

01:40.684 --> 01:42.283
And that's how you make a New Year's resolution.
