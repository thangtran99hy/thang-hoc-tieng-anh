I'm Jaleh Sadravi and I'm an alumna of Valparaiso University.

00:07.972 --> 00:13.472
I think that Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a great time to reflect and remember the legacy of a man...

00:13.805 --> 00:16.293
...that taught this country about peace and justice.

00:16.522 --> 00:19.436
If you want to be great, wonderful!

00:19.906 --> 00:26.179
But recognize that he who is greatest among you shall be your servant.

00:27.381 --> 00:30.183
My favorite speech of Dr. King is "The Beloved Community."

00:30.725 --> 00:35.927
In this speech, he encourages everyone to come together no matter their race or their creed.

00:36.624 --> 00:40.613
While I was a student at Valpo, I enjoyed the events that honored his legacy.

00:41.190 --> 00:43.763
Valpo had four weeks of celebration,...

00:44.006 --> 00:47.318
...offering the campus community a chance to embrace diversity...

00:47.516 --> 00:50.141
...and to learn more about social justice issues.

00:50.847 --> 00:54.283
Every year, MLK Day is highlighted by a convocation.

00:55.069 --> 00:58.610
There is a keynote speaker who inspires the campus with their own story.

00:59.479 --> 01:03.211
There are also awards given to those on campus that encourage diversity.

01:04.469 --> 01:07.971
Lively music is sung and I would encourage everyone to attend,...

01:08.261 --> 01:10.839
...for this is truly an enjoyable experience.

01:11.415 --> 01:13.755
So come be a part of our celebration here at Valpo,...

01:14.067 --> 01:16.795
...and see for yourself what MLK Day is all about.
