00:00.321 --> 00:05.735
Five score years ago, I have a dream.

00:06.381 --> 00:12.145
On January 15, 1929, an African-American boy was born to his mother and father.

00:12.629 --> 00:15.206
His name was Michael Luther King, Jr.

00:15.710 --> 00:18.671
As a young boy, Michael grew up in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:19.216 --> 00:20.834
It was a difficult time in the world.

00:21.357 --> 00:24.335
He always found it difficult to play with some of the other boys in town.

00:25.019 --> 00:27.810
Their parents never let poor Michael play with their kids.

00:28.221 --> 00:29.823
He didn't realize it at that time,...

00:30.190 --> 00:34.637
...but the color of his skin would be the cause of many injustices for the rest of his life.

00:34.928 --> 00:39.803
Michael's father took over his father's job as pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church.

00:39.886 --> 00:44.155
His family had always had an active role in the church since before Michael was born.

00:44.751 --> 00:47.846
At the age of six, Michael and his family traveled to Europe.

00:48.473 --> 00:55.418
While visiting Germany, Michael and his father changed their names to Martin Luther King and Martin Luther King, Jr.

00:55.950 --> 00:59.062
At the age of 15, Martin graduated from high school.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.843
Years later after attending many colleges,...

01:02.198 --> 01:05.815
...Martin moved to Boston where he graduated from Boston University.

01:06.524 --> 01:09.791
While living in Boston, he met and married Coretta Scott.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.593
And two sons and two daughters were born into the family.

01:14.215 --> 01:16.906
While having a happy life at home with his wife and kids,...

01:17.228 --> 01:20.127
...he still felt he had a calling larger than himself.

01:20.649 --> 01:24.179
Over the years, Martin was part of many peace protests.

01:24.445 --> 01:28.669
He preached for peace and for equal rights for not only African-Americans,...

01:28.907 --> 01:30.809
...but for every person in the world.
