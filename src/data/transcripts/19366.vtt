South Korea has its first ever woman president.

00:04.639 --> 00:08.158
The electoral commission has confirmed that the conservative Park Geun-hye...

00:08.560 --> 00:09.939
...has won the presidential election.

00:10.655 --> 00:13.677
The 60-year-old will return to the presidential palace in Seoul,...

00:13.805 --> 00:16.755
...where she was effectively the first lady in the 1970s.

00:17.216 --> 00:19.238
Her father was the military ruler at the time,...

00:19.595 --> 00:21.857
...and she stepped in when her mother was assassinated.

00:23.614 --> 00:27.376
There was little to choose between Park and her left wing opponent Moon Jae-in,...

00:27.869 --> 00:30.760

One priority will be the economy,...

00:47.015 --> 00:49.323
