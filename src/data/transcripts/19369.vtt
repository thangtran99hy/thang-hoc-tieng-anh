I think the biggest competitive advantage that young people have when starting an organization...

00:10.740 --> 00:16.860
...is that a lot of the way things are right now is taken for granted,...

00:16.935 --> 00:20.398
...in the sense that if you start a company now in technology,...

00:20.853 --> 00:25.079
...you take for granted that we have persistent Wi-Fi connections and that everyone is online.

00:27.743 --> 00:32.963
And you take for granted as well the values of your generation.

00:33.036 --> 00:37.561
I think sometimes your competitors will be much larger, older organizations...

00:37.821 --> 00:40.043
...and now have a mindset that it's about the old way.

00:40.387 --> 00:45.721
So as a media company, a lot of our competitors were in the newspaper business or the magazine industry.

00:45.929 --> 00:51.591
They have a lot of legacy stuff that not only holds them back in terms of them being able to move as fast as we are,...

00:51.875 --> 00:55.789
...but in terms of their thinking and understanding that the world is completely different now.

00:56.022 --> 00:59.641
...that being online makes for a completely different media experience.

00:59.949 --> 01:02.393
And you know, for me and for us as an organization,...

01:02.733 --> 01:07.528
...we didn't have the legacy understanding of, "Hey, we're a magazine."

01:07.705 --> 01:10.424
We had the understanding of, "Hey, we're a blog," as we started out.

01:10.775 --> 01:15.949
And that we just took everything that was already part of our generation as a norm.

01:16.239 --> 01:18.117
And actually it wasn't the norm, it was a very new thing.

01:18.393 --> 01:22.481
And we were building a very, very new company that was completely different from the ones that have been before.
