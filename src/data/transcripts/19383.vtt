00:01.661 --> 00:05.248
It's International Holocaust Remembrance Day.

00:05.626 --> 00:12.319
And at Auschwitz, survivors of Hitler's Final Solution were among those marking 67 years...

00:12.449 --> 00:16.475
...exactly since the death camps liberation by the Red Army.

00:17.162 --> 00:24.517
The Nazis murdered about one and a half million people at Auschwitz and occupied Poland; most of them were Jews.

00:25.444 --> 00:29.342
Victims of the Holocaust were remembered in Germany's parliament.

00:29.787 --> 00:34.890
Literary critic and Warsaw ghetto survivor Marcel Reich-Ranicki...

00:35.083 --> 00:41.280
...told how Jews there were rounded up and deported in what the Nazis called "relocation".

00:42.616 --> 00:53.110
Now age 91, he said the relocation from Warsaw only had one goal, only had one purpose: death.

00:54.703 --> 00:58.929
And Germany has plenty to think about this Holocaust Remembrance Day.

00:59.245 --> 01:03.940
One survey suggests anti-Semitism remains entrenched in the country.

01:04.091 --> 01:09.912
Another that up to one in five young Germans don't know what happened at Auschwitz.
