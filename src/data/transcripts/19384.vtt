Hello, scholars.

00:01.531 --> 00:02.215
Look at your grades.

00:02.459 --> 00:03.065
Now look at mine.

00:03.501 --> 00:05.647
Now back at your grades, now back to mine.

00:06.105 --> 00:07.686
Sadly, they're not like mine.

00:07.971 --> 00:11.533
But if you stopped studying in a cave and started studying like me, they could be like mine.

00:11.813 --> 00:12.370
Look at your shirt.

00:12.597 --> 00:13.159
Now back at mine.

00:13.486 --> 00:14.471
Look down, back up.

00:14.692 --> 00:15.178
Where are you?

00:15.315 --> 00:18.213
You're in the library, with the man your grades could be like!

00:18.708 --> 00:21.601
Did you know that eight out of five dentists say that studying in the library...

00:21.669 --> 00:24.511
...is six bajillion times more effective than studying in your shower?

00:25.855 --> 00:26.438
Close your eyes.

00:26.717 --> 00:27.495
Now open your eyes.

00:27.639 --> 00:28.062
Where are you?

00:28.241 --> 00:30.165
You're in a beautifully quiet place where you can study.

00:30.393 --> 00:30.991
Look at your hand.

00:31.118 --> 00:31.965
Now back to me.

00:32.193 --> 00:32.557
I have it.

00:32.752 --> 00:35.931
It's a laptop with access to bucketloads of library databases.

00:36.117 --> 00:36.671
Look again.

00:36.771 --> 00:39.928
The laptop is now a celestial sandwich here in the snack zone.

00:40.273 --> 00:42.357
Anything is possible when you're in the library.

00:42.583 --> 00:43.345
I'm on a cart.
