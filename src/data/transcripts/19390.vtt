This man is Rob Spence and he makes films.

00:04.385 --> 00:08.839
No, literally, his body makes films.

00:09.195 --> 00:11.339
After a shooting accident when he was nine,...

00:11.840 --> 00:14.181
...Rob had to have his eye surgically removed.

00:14.834 --> 00:19.246
But after joking with friends about having a robotic cyborg one installed instead,...

00:19.807 --> 00:23.240
...documentary maker Rob actually went and did it.

00:23.692 --> 00:28.939
Pretty much anyone who loses an eye will make a joke.

00:29.066 --> 00:30.889
At least I should get a camera put in there.

00:31.407 --> 00:34.333
It's not a wacky, out of this world concept.

00:35.119 --> 00:37.823
Years of hard work and research have left him with this.

00:38.219 --> 00:42.871
A tiny camera implanted in his eye socket which transmits video wirelessly...

00:42.948 --> 00:45.585
...to screens, TVs, hard drives and cameras.

00:46.181 --> 00:48.543
And it has opened up a whole new perspective for him,...

00:48.958 --> 00:52.727
...even getting him offers of, and surprisingly secret, camera work.

00:53.051 --> 00:57.137
One very high up news executive said would I like to go to Iraq...

00:57.765 --> 01:01.885
...with my prosthetic eye and see what I could see there...

01:02.579 --> 01:08.524
...because sometimes when you have a giant camera, it's not such a great idea in a war zone.

01:10.099 --> 01:14.823
But instead, sci-fi fan Rob went around the world making a documentary on cyborgs...

01:15.268 --> 01:18.206
...alongside the makers of the computer game Deus Ex.

01:18.665 --> 01:21.071
That game features a cyborg from the future.

01:21.523 --> 01:23.479
Here's one from today.
