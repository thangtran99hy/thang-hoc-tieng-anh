00:01.911 --> 00:07.148
Three, two, one, boom!

00:16.431 --> 00:21.062
There was a time when everything was played by my rules.

00:22.607 --> 00:24.168
Father Time's rules.

00:26.540 --> 00:27.201
The sun.

00:29.869 --> 00:30.579
The moon.

00:32.262 --> 00:33.009
The tides.

00:33.707 --> 00:35.733
All were under my control.

00:37.346 --> 00:39.081
Time marched onwards.

00:41.035 --> 00:42.555
Tick followed tock.

00:44.342 --> 00:45.975
No monkey business.

00:47.993 --> 00:54.025
But after thousands of years of service, it seems time has caught up with me.

00:58.637 --> 01:01.748
It's nighttime, not playtime.

01:08.353 --> 01:09.232
Do you fix these?

01:10.471 --> 01:11.433
Not those.

01:17.602 --> 01:19.471
There's been a shift in power.

01:26.709 --> 01:27.911
Gets me every time.
