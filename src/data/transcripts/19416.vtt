Today I'm going to talk about word stress and questions versus statements.

00:05.780 --> 00:11.289
In English, statements generally tend to go down in pitch throughout the phrase.

00:12.163 --> 00:15.227
Questions, on the other hand, tend to go up at the end.

00:15.687 --> 00:17.911
For example, "You know what I mean."

00:18.477 --> 00:22.947
This can be a statement if you're talking to somebody and you're explaining something...

00:23.435 --> 00:27.815
...but you know that they understand, maybe because they've had the same experience.

00:28.352 --> 00:30.431
You might say, "You know what I mean."

00:31.095 --> 00:31.816
Statement.

00:32.537 --> 00:36.773
But if you're talking and you wanna make sure that the person is understanding you,...

00:37.011 --> 00:38.924
...you might say, "You know what I mean?"

00:39.539 --> 00:40.670
Asking a question.

00:41.310 --> 00:45.255
Statement: You know what I mean, you know what I mean.

00:45.667 --> 00:46.601
Voice goes down.

00:47.356 --> 00:49.405
Question:  You know what I mean?

00:50.143 --> 00:51.006
You know what I mean?

00:52.001 --> 00:53.213
Voice goes up at the end.

00:53.849 --> 00:54.784
"See you tomorrow."

00:55.339 --> 01:00.423
Let's say you're at work and you know that you're going to be at work tomorrow and so is your colleague.

01:00.950 --> 01:03.849
When you part ways, you might say, "See you tomorrow."

01:04.308 --> 01:04.981
Statement.

01:05.731 --> 01:08.105
But maybe you're not sure that your colleague will be there.

01:08.398 --> 01:10.602
Then you might say, "See you tomorrow?"

01:11.033 --> 01:11.707
Question.

01:12.060 --> 01:15.177
That would be like asking, "Are you going to be in tomorrow?"

01:15.583 --> 01:16.628
See you tomorrow?

01:17.797 --> 01:19.645
Statement: See you tomorrow.

01:20.034 --> 01:20.952
Voice goes down.

01:21.433 --> 01:23.363
Question: See you tomorrow?

01:23.847 --> 01:25.104
Voice goes up at the end.
