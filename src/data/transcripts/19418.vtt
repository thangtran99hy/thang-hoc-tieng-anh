Word stress is the idea that any word with more than one syllable,...

00:04.344 --> 00:09.175
...one or more than one syllable will be stressed or accented...

00:09.699 --> 00:13.103
..and the rest will be unstressed or unaccented.

00:13.724 --> 00:18.155
Notice that I'm using the words "stress" and "accent" interchangeably.

00:18.656 --> 00:22.466
So, in English, not all syllables are created equal.

00:22.945 --> 00:28.177
Stressed or accented syllables will be higher in pitch, longer in duration...

00:28.487 --> 00:33.067
...and generally a little louder than unstressed or unaccented syllables.

00:34.269 --> 00:35.839
So let's look at some examples.

00:36.219 --> 00:36.962
Chapter.

00:37.817 --> 00:43.613
A two-syllable word, "chapter". Which syllable do you think is stressed?

00:44.313 --> 00:46.756
It's the first syllable, chapter.

00:47.099 --> 00:49.717
Can you hear that it's louder and that it's higher in pitch?

00:50.091 --> 00:51.764
The word "imagination".

00:52.356 --> 00:58.073
Imagination. "Na" has a primary stress.

00:58.307 --> 01:00.713
But there is a secondary stress in this word.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.879
Ima, on the second syllable.

01:04.614 --> 01:06.628
Imagination.

01:07.040 --> 01:09.010
So, what is a secondary stress?

01:09.321 --> 01:13.365
This means that it will be a little higher in pitch, maybe a little longer in duration,...

01:13.831 --> 01:18.469
...but not quite as much as the syllable in the word that has the primary stress.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.125
Does word stress really matter?

01:21.436 --> 01:22.282
Absolutely.

01:22.814 --> 01:26.746
It can affect the pronunciation, it can affect the meaning of a word.

01:27.211 --> 01:29.012
Let's take for example this word.

01:30.217 --> 01:34.698
As an adjective or a noun, the stress falls on the first syllable.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.171
Present, present.

01:37.923 --> 01:43.384
As a verb, the stress falls on the second syllable. Present, present.

01:44.441 --> 01:48.075
So as a noun or adjective, the first vowel is the /ɛ/ as in "bed",...

01:48.571 --> 01:51.251
...and the second syllable, unaccented, is the schwa.

01:51.934 --> 01:56.143
In the verb form, however, "present", the first vowel,...

01:56.321 --> 02:00.145
...in the unaccented syllable, is the /ɪ/ as in "sit" vowel...

02:00.709 --> 02:05.086
...and the second vowel in the stressed syllable is the /ɛ/ as in "bed".

02:05.921 --> 02:07.676
Present. Present.
