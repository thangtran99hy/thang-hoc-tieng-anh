00:16.515 --> 00:17.912
The world is too big, mom.

00:21.081 --> 00:22.099
Then make it small.

00:26.299 --> 00:27.527
Focus on my voice.

00:28.664 --> 00:32.070
Pretend it's an island, out in the ocean.

00:33.383 --> 00:34.125
Can you see it?

00:36.716 --> 00:37.399
I see it.

00:41.339 --> 00:43.373
My son was in the bus.

00:46.053 --> 00:47.924
He saw what Clark did.

00:51.533 --> 00:54.097
You have to keep this side of yourself a secret.

00:54.738 --> 00:55.844
What was I supposed to do?

00:56.779 --> 00:57.587
Just let them die?

01:01.625 --> 01:02.153
Maybe.

01:07.723 --> 01:09.187
I have so many questions.

01:10.464 --> 01:11.414
Where do I come from?

01:20.163 --> 01:22.907
You just have to decide what kind of man you want to grow up to be, Clark.

01:25.781 --> 01:27.165
Whoever that man is,...

01:31.711 --> 01:33.059
...he's gonna change the world.

02:04.795 --> 02:09.017
My father believed that if the world found out who I really was, they'd reject me.

02:09.985 --> 02:14.022
He was convinced that the world wasn't ready.

02:16.186 --> 02:16.989
What do you think?
