00:09.129 --> 00:11.399
New York, 1922.

00:12.486 --> 00:15.062
The tempo of the city had changed sharply.

00:15.432 --> 00:16.612
The buildings were higher.

00:17.930 --> 00:19.191
Parties were bigger.

00:19.593 --> 00:21.997
The morals were looser and the liquor was cheaper.

00:23.109 --> 00:26.619
The restlessness approached hysteria.

00:26.722 --> 00:27.066
Shall we?

00:28.264 --> 00:29.449
Who is this Gatsby?

00:29.969 --> 00:30.517
Do you know him?

00:30.597 --> 00:31.399
War hero.

00:31.474 --> 00:33.441
Mr. Gatsby doesn't exist.

00:33.543 --> 00:34.141
Gatsby?

00:34.626 --> 00:35.268
What Gatsby?

00:39.593 --> 00:40.455
I beg your pardon.

00:40.823 --> 00:44.566
Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you, alone.

00:52.905 --> 00:54.846
I'm certainly glad to see you again.

00:55.941 --> 00:58.045
I'm certainly glad to see you as well.

01:00.092 --> 01:02.640
When I made the pleasure of Mr. Gatsby's acquaintance,...

01:02.745 --> 01:05.175
...I discovered a man of fine breeding.

01:05.834 --> 01:06.573
Very interesting.

01:07.074 --> 01:07.944
Everything alright?

01:08.509 --> 01:09.085
Oh yes.

01:16.845 --> 01:18.549
You always look so cool,...

01:19.450 --> 01:21.561
...the man in the cool, beautiful shirt.

01:25.620 --> 01:28.064
She has to tell him she never loved him.

01:29.889 --> 01:31.879
I've just heard the most shocking thing.

01:32.946 --> 01:34.887
It all makes sense.

01:34.995 --> 01:35.998
Will you come, old sport?

01:37.223 --> 01:37.760
We need you.

01:38.774 --> 01:40.513
I wish we could just run away.

01:41.830 --> 01:43.119
Mr. Gatsby, sir.

01:45.067 --> 01:45.683
Not now.

02:00.772 --> 02:02.116
What kind of a row...

02:02.184 --> 02:03.719
...are you trying to cause in my house?

02:06.358 --> 02:07.635
Get the hell out of here!

02:15.422 --> 02:18.038
I wish I had done everything on Earth with you.
