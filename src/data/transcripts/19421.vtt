00:08.215 --> 00:09.164
What kind of bird are you?

00:10.453 --> 00:12.232
I'm a sparrow, she's a dove.

00:12.309 --> 00:13.405
No, I said,...

00:14.731 --> 00:16.421
...what kind of bird are you?

00:20.882 --> 00:22.493
Dear Suzy, here is my plan.

00:22.924 --> 00:24.611
Dear Sam, my answer is yes.

00:25.038 --> 00:26.011
Dear Suzy, when?

00:26.481 --> 00:27.609
Dear Sam, where?

00:27.941 --> 00:34.111
Dear Suzy, walk 400 yards due north from your house to the dirt path which has not got any name on it,...

00:34.437 --> 00:36.055
...turn right and follow to the end.

00:36.461 --> 00:37.831
I will meet you in the meadow.

00:41.350 --> 00:41.762
Who's missing?

00:42.863 --> 00:44.001
Shakusky, you in there?

00:45.775 --> 00:47.345
Jiminy Cricket, he flew the coop!

00:53.646 --> 00:55.000
Walt, where the hell are you?

00:55.452 --> 00:56.046
Right here.

00:57.027 --> 00:59.369
Does it concern you that your daughter has just ran away from home?

01:01.723 --> 01:02.645
That's a loaded question.

01:03.847 --> 01:07.226
Until help arrives, I'm deputizing the little guy, the skinny one...

01:07.446 --> 01:10.007
...and the boy with the patch on his eye to come with me in the station wagon.

01:16.392 --> 01:17.163
What am I looking at?

01:17.979 --> 01:21.347
He does watercolors, mostly landscapes but a few nudes.

01:21.942 --> 01:25.215
If we find him I'm not gonna be the one who forgot to bring a weapon.

01:26.701 --> 01:27.188
Me neither.

01:35.034 --> 01:35.952
Where's the boy?

01:36.223 --> 01:38.445
I'm told that he's just been struck by lightning.

01:39.300 --> 01:39.949
It's true.

01:49.213 --> 01:50.039
I'll be out back.

01:52.179 --> 01:53.581
I'm gonna find a tree to chop down.
