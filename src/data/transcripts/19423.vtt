Put away your "The end is near" signs, all you apocalypse predictors.

00:08.485 --> 00:14.435
That 2012 date you thought the ancient Mayans set for the big adios appears to be bogus.

00:15.124 --> 00:18.229
Archaeologists working at Mayan ruins in Guatemala...

00:18.701 --> 00:22.039
...discovered a six-foot square room whose walls are covered...

00:22.115 --> 00:26.323
...with 12,000-year-old astronomical records of Mayan scribes,...

00:26.659 --> 00:31.513
...who used these observations to accurately chart their culture's famous calendar.

00:32.221 --> 00:36.026
The newly discovered calculations suggest Mayan math geeks...

00:36.112 --> 00:39.958
...were actually projecting 6,000 years into the future,...

00:40.469 --> 00:46.142
...scrambling everyone's doomsday plans and rendering John Cusack thriller plots moot.

00:46.871 --> 00:50.503
At 600 years older than any other Mayan calculations,...

00:50.811 --> 00:53.009
...this new discovery is the original.

00:53.703 --> 00:55.603
So maybe we can rest a little easier...

00:56.251 --> 01:02.085
...and maybe Saturday Night Live was right after all about the reason for the 2012 fearmongering.

01:02.708 --> 01:05.152
Man, you just ran out of space and stopped didn't you?

01:05.249 --> 01:06.951
No, that is not the case.

01:07.016 --> 01:07.872
That's a lie.

01:08.995 --> 01:10.429
Okay, yes, you got us.

01:10.498 --> 01:11.251
We ran out of space.
