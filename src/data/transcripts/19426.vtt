Yeah, everyone likes to eat.

00:04.192 --> 00:08.227
But the truth is, it's not often I find people who love food...

00:08.522 --> 00:09.107
...like I do.

00:11.279 --> 00:17.227
So it's great that I found a place where I can talk about things that I usually wouldn't share anywhere else.

00:17.965 --> 00:22.734
Like how farm fresh eggs taste a billion times better than the grocery store stuff.

00:23.652 --> 00:25.900
And I can spend an afternoon hanging out,...

00:25.976 --> 00:31.435
...learning how to prep radicchio or how to make the perfect Neapolitan crust.

00:32.861 --> 00:37.446
It's this wonderful group of people that are genuinely happy when I share a favorite recipe.

00:40.633 --> 00:43.866
It almost feels like I've known this group of people forever...

00:44.043 --> 00:47.763
...because we're all connected around this thing we really love.
