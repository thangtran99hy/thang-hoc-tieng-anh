So, you've just begun your road trip with some friends when you decide to read a book in the backseat.

00:04.785 --> 00:08.677
But after only moments of reading, you start feeling dizzy, fatigued, and nauseous.

00:09.100 --> 00:10.516
Sounds like motion sickness.

00:10.795 --> 00:15.442
The surprising truth is that about 30 percent of the population experiences motion sickness,...

00:16.000 --> 00:19.700
...with over 66 percent of people experiencing it in extreme conditions.

00:19.752 --> 00:23.528
This happens when your eyes and inner ear are sending different signals to the brain.

00:23.786 --> 00:28.211
The vestibular system inside your ear contribute to balance and spatial orientation.

00:28.603 --> 00:32.040
Tiny hairs inside the canal detect the movement of a fluid inside it,...

00:32.430 --> 00:33.821
...allowing you to orient yourself.

00:34.267 --> 00:39.112
If you lean to the side, the fluid moves, and signals are sent to your brain to help you understand this.

00:39.470 --> 00:42.559
But oftentimes, in a car, on a boat, or in the IMAX theater,...

00:42.769 --> 00:46.553
...your vestibular system is transmitting a different signal from your other senses.

00:46.840 --> 00:51.197
In the case of your car, your eyes see that everything in the car is seemingly stationary...

00:51.587 --> 00:53.042
...particularly when you stare at a book.

00:53.603 --> 00:55.570
But your ears feel the movement of the car.

00:56.045 --> 00:59.244
Conversely, in the IMAX theater, your eyes see a lot of motion,...

00:59.523 --> 01:01.891
...while your ear is experiencing very little movement at all.

01:02.185 --> 01:04.929
This mismatch of signals tells the brain something's wrong.

01:05.216 --> 01:06.693
So, why does it induce vomiting?

01:07.064 --> 01:12.503
The leading theory suggests that evolutionarily, if the input signals from your ears and eyes weren't matching,...

01:12.820 --> 01:14.633
...you'd likely ingested a neurotoxin.

01:14.972 --> 01:16.073
The easiest way to get rid of it?

01:16.568 --> 01:16.969
Throw it up.

01:17.370 --> 01:22.872
This was a fairly useful and accurate system before the advent of technology and advanced transportation.

01:23.451 --> 01:25.091
Too bad the brain never got the memo.
