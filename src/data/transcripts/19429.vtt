Have you ever gotten a flat or had to patch a hole in your bike tire?

00:05.196 --> 00:07.931
Well, that may be a thing of the past if designer Brian Russell's...

00:08.047 --> 00:10.463
...airless and puncture proof tires get licensed.

00:11.143 --> 00:13.948
Britek Tire and Rubber, Russell's Colorado company,...

00:14.025 --> 00:16.979
...has spent years working on an airless tire for automobiles,...

00:17.188 --> 00:19.649
...but have shifted its attention recently to bike tires.

00:20.167 --> 00:23.838
The concept, named "Energy Return Wheel" or ERW,...

00:24.049 --> 00:26.433
..."uses rubber that's stretched over a series of carbon...

00:26.536 --> 00:29.792
...nanotube-reinforced composite rods to provide cushioning.

00:30.235 --> 00:34.309
These rods can be adjusted to change the tension in the tire to suit different terrain."

00:35.045 --> 00:37.569
The company hopes to literally "reinvent the wheel" by...

00:37.653 --> 00:40.246
...providing tires that are not only puncture proof and airless,...

00:40.455 --> 00:42.567
...but provide a more even and efficient ride.

00:43.269 --> 00:46.129
Designers are contemplating adding sidewalls on the bike tires...

00:46.346 --> 00:48.731
...so that mud and dirt will not plug up the frame.

00:49.578 --> 00:52.007
The design is still currently in the prototype phase,...

00:52.089 --> 00:53.747
...and the company notes that they are looking for...

00:53.813 --> 00:56.511
...companies and sponsors to help in licensing the product.

00:57.127 --> 00:59.272
What do you think of the airless tire concept?
