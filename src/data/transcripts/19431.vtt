Companies used to view us as demographics...

00:05.330 --> 00:07.142
...because they couldn't see what made people different.

00:09.350 --> 00:15.187
Today, retailers from the US to Japan are using analytics to find insight in social chatter,...

00:15.352 --> 00:17.189
...reviews and sales transactions,...

00:18.087 --> 00:21.248
...helping some companies increase online revenue up to 50 percent...

00:21.684 --> 00:24.609
...by offering customers an experience as unique as they are.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.573
That's what I'm working on.

00:26.729 --> 00:29.421
I'm an IBMer. Let's build a smarter planet.
