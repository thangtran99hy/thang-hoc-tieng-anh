Welcome to another edition of Truth or Fail where our demographics analysts have told me...

00:04.779 --> 00:08.233
...that the audience for this show really enjoys Sherlock Holmes.

00:08.335 --> 00:13.558
And hey, I love Sherlock Holmes as well, but I'm not just talking about the BBC Sherlock...

00:13.661 --> 00:18.788
...or other recent interpretations that we may not want to go into with Robert Downey Jr.

00:18.862 --> 00:21.515
As much as I love those, there is an amazing history behind...

00:21.613 --> 00:24.685
...Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's legendary literary creation.

00:25.080 --> 00:30.515
So today, we're going to delve into all things Sherlock and maybe, if you're lucky,...

00:30.901 --> 00:33.377
...I'll even throw in a question about the Cumberbatch show.

00:33.461 --> 00:38.311
So, put on your deerstalker cap and cape and as always, pay attention to the clues.

00:38.628 --> 00:39.048
Let's play.

00:39.158 --> 00:41.185
Round number one: Origins.

00:41.493 --> 00:46.160
Fact number one: Sherlock Holmes may be fictitious but Arthur Conan Doyle hinted many times...

00:46.253 --> 00:50.674
...during his lifetime that the detective was based on a family friend named Dr. Charles House.

00:50.732 --> 00:53.972
House was actually a medical doctor but he loved detective work...

00:54.065 --> 00:56.489
...and often assisted the local police in solving crimes.

00:56.621 --> 01:00.997
And yes, he's the reason that we had a Dr. House on the popular television series...

01:01.134 --> 01:02.438
...or it could be fact number two.

01:02.875 --> 01:06.798
Sherlock Holmes is the subject of 56 short stories and four novels by Conan Doyle...

01:07.088 --> 01:10.367
...and all but four of the stories were narrated by Dr. John Watson:...

01:10.489 --> 01:13.307
...Holmes' friend, assistant and occasional roommate.

01:13.428 --> 01:18.096
But did you know that in all those stories Watson's first name is only mentioned three times...

01:18.449 --> 01:20.161
...and never by Holmes himself.
