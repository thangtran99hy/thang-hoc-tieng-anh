Pulling into Brooklyn was a very important person, none other than Elvis Presley.

00:08.145 --> 00:11.133
Private Presley, soldier nowadays in Uncle Sam's service.

00:11.775 --> 00:16.019
The wonderful fans and an army of press men went on hand; this was indeed an occasion.

00:16.915 --> 00:20.813
The rock and roll king was about to embark for foreign service: 18 months in Germany.

00:21.501 --> 00:25.460
How the army would stand the impact of Mr. Presley was a big question months ago,...

00:25.669 --> 00:28.039
...but not now as Elvis explains.

00:28.177 --> 00:32.911
Elvis, since you've been in the army, have the boys given you kind of a rough time in the barracks...

00:33.036 --> 00:34.972
...because of your past career, would you say?

00:35.203 --> 00:36.815
No sir, I was very surprised.

00:37.903 --> 00:41.901
I've never met a better group of boys in my life.

00:42.013 --> 00:44.974
They probably would have.

00:46.881 --> 00:48.333
If it had been like everybody thought,...

00:48.433 --> 00:51.327
...I mean, everybody thought I wouldn't have to work...

00:51.429 --> 00:53.959
...and I would be given special treatment in this and that.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.198
But when they looked around and saw I was on KP...

00:57.274 --> 00:59.555
...and I was pulling guard and everything just like they were,...

00:59.648 --> 01:02.407
...well they figured, "Well, he's just like us."

01:03.458 --> 01:07.231
When he is demobbed, Elvis hopes to develop his talent as a movie actor.

01:07.900 --> 01:10.851
Meanwhile, it's the army for Elvis the Pelvis.
