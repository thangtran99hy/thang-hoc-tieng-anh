ï»¿Listen to me, Burt.

00:03.961 --> 00:04.703
Nobody likes you.

00:05.015 --> 00:06.182
Nobody will ever like you.

00:09.701 --> 00:12.253
Welcome to the amazing world of magic.

00:14.561 --> 00:16.397
Everyone loves a magician.

00:16.731 --> 00:17.765
And they'll love you too.

00:17.969 --> 00:19.095
Do you want to be my partner?

00:19.181 --> 00:20.639
More than anything!

00:26.371 --> 00:27.813
I'm Burt Wonderstone!

00:27.889 --> 00:29.343
And I'm Anton Marvelton!

00:29.419 --> 00:31.097
But of course, you already knew that!

00:35.172 --> 00:36.262
Your ticket sales suck.

00:37.850 --> 00:38.025
What?

00:39.949 --> 00:42.843
Steve Gray: they're calling him the future of magic.

00:43.387 --> 00:45.435
The guy is a magician and he doesn't even have a costume.

00:46.573 --> 00:49.453
I'm sure you've seen people walk on red-hot coals.

00:49.585 --> 00:52.876
But I doubt you've seen anyone spend the night on red-hot coals.

01:00.225 --> 01:01.751
You need to do something fresh.

01:01.813 --> 01:04.040
So, this is where old entertainers go to die?

01:05.143 --> 01:06.498
And some, not so old.

01:07.197 --> 01:08.424
May I see that for a minute?

01:08.500 --> 01:09.303
Watch this!

01:10.455 --> 01:11.651
What have you done?

01:11.747 --> 01:12.582
I'm a magician.

01:12.665 --> 01:14.632
I should have explained that to you earlier.

01:15.959 --> 01:16.931
You're Rance Holloway.

01:17.127 --> 01:18.713
I had your magic kit as a kid.

01:18.949 --> 01:20.151
I'll give you your money back.

01:22.372 --> 01:23.897
What you're feeling right now.

01:24.011 --> 01:25.569
That's why you became a magician.

01:25.666 --> 01:26.403
How did you do that?

01:26.522 --> 01:28.037
It's partially deboned.

01:29.879 --> 01:31.486
What you do is not magic.

01:31.549 --> 01:34.157
It's natural for a dying leaf to be frightened by the autumn wind.

01:34.685 --> 01:35.631
Your skin makes me cry.

01:36.450 --> 01:38.359
We need some sort of grand illusion!

01:38.519 --> 01:41.230
You and Burt Wonderstone plan to stay in the box for an entire week?

01:43.567 --> 01:44.274
I can't breathe!

01:44.343 --> 01:45.469
It's only been 20 minutes!

01:47.715 --> 01:49.326
This is the best trick ever!

02:00.957 --> 02:03.981
For 12 days, he's held his urine.

02:04.327 --> 02:06.479
What is going through your mind?

02:06.605 --> 02:07.706
I really have to pee, Richard.

02:10.424 --> 02:12.995
It's time for my final disappearing act.

02:14.652 --> 02:15.625
Where did he go?

02:15.819 --> 02:17.457
He has gone to a better place.

02:17.626 --> 02:18.743
Goodbye, Rance.

02:18.933 --> 02:19.807
He's under the bed.

02:19.897 --> 02:20.261
I know.
