It's an interesting thing to be at a place and to feel invested in that place...

00:15.158 --> 00:18.676
...and then to have people outside come in and do such work.

00:19.185 --> 00:21.482
And this is what Martin Luther King Day is about.

00:21.559 --> 00:24.486
It's about getting into the community and helping...

00:24.710 --> 00:26.105
...and everybody working together.

00:26.177 --> 00:29.891
And this is a good example of Lancaster at work.

00:30.142 --> 00:35.406
This really shows the commitment to service that is the spirit of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

00:35.469 --> 00:39.091
And it's always just a joy to see the people coming together and taking care of our community...

00:39.158 --> 00:40.282
...and taking pride in our community.

00:40.347 --> 00:45.333
It's been really a healthy thing, I think, to serve together, and it's through collaborative efforts like this...

00:45.403 --> 00:46.603
...that things get accomplished...

00:46.663 --> 00:50.441
...as different parts of our community come together with some leadership from our city.

00:50.591 --> 00:55.690
And that is exactly what Dr. Martin Luther King would say or do.

00:56.015 --> 01:00.240
He didn't pick color, he didn't pick religion, he didn't pick gender.

01:00.683 --> 01:01.943
He just said, "Can I help?"
