I think what we're seeing right now is people are going to college,...

00:09.762 --> 00:12.225
...they're spending 200,000 dollars on an education for four years...

00:12.297 --> 00:17.395
...and leaving without practical skills that they can apply immediately for a job opportunity.

00:17.847 --> 00:20.889
Those people may need something that will give them what they need to find employment.

00:21.587 --> 00:22.537
I'm Zach Sims.

00:22.662 --> 00:24.828
I'm the co-founder of a company called Codecademy,...

00:25.173 --> 00:26.993
...and we teach people to program online.

00:28.109 --> 00:30.916
My name is Ryan, I'm the technical co-founder of Codecademy.

00:31.486 --> 00:37.491
Programming or code in general is something that isn't immediately accessible to a lot of people.

00:37.591 --> 00:41.127
They're either not really comfortable with it or they don't know where to begin...

00:41.231 --> 00:44.573
...so we're trying to make getting started as easy as possible...

00:44.843 --> 00:47.465
...and actually strike the imagination by showing them magic.

00:47.671 --> 00:50.942
You can show them what a program is capable of before you have to explain it.

00:51.196 --> 00:53.365
We start you off by typing your name in, right?

00:53.807 --> 00:56.800
And then we walk you through, like, how to do addition in a terminal,...

00:57.071 --> 00:59.367
...how you can write a program to do really simple things like that.

00:59.578 --> 01:02.201
We explain, like, what the language is, why you need to learn it on.

01:02.273 --> 01:04.669
It's really simple for people that have never done something before.
