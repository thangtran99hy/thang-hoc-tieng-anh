Yes, the new iPhone 5 you got for Christmas is pretty cool,...

00:06.420 --> 00:07.457
...but can it dance?

00:07.744 --> 00:11.648
One of the iPhone 5's most useful features is the panorama camera mode,...

00:11.811 --> 00:14.335
...which lets you take 240-degree photos.

00:14.527 --> 00:19.623
CNET reports that the new app, Cycloramic, takes that idea one step further...

00:19.807 --> 00:25.871
...by using the iPhone's vibration and sensors to spin itself 360 degrees while taking video.

00:26.057 --> 00:29.253

00:29.485 --> 00:31.992

00:32.113 --> 00:35.546
...but that's a small price to pay to show off your phone's moves.
