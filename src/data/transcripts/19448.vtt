00:03.475 --> 00:08.092
Right now in Central Park, we are assembling to receive instructions...

00:08.189 --> 00:11.389
...from strangers about how we should take our pants off in the subway.

00:11.883 --> 00:14.886
This is the Ninth Annual No Pants Subway Ride.

00:16.391 --> 00:19.938
Basically, we have a large group of people in six different spots in New York...

00:20.405 --> 00:26.213
...get on the train, take their pants off and ride it down to Union Square to meet with everyone else.

00:26.649 --> 00:30.792
It's really just to create scenes of joy and chaos...

00:30.871 --> 00:32.239
...and put a smile on New Yorkers' faces.

00:34.899 --> 00:38.723
We're here to be courteous and have fun and just share a smile with other New Yorkers.

00:38.937 --> 00:42.213
Originally, the first No Pants Subway Ride had seven people,...

00:42.294 --> 00:45.309
...and this year, we're expecting a couple of thousand,...

00:45.379 --> 00:47.948
...so they kind of have to split it up into multiple locations.

00:48.031 --> 00:52.322
We're starting all over the place, and hopefully we're gonna all meet at one place.

00:56.545 --> 00:59.049
If they ask us what are we doing...

01:00.049 --> 01:01.579
...we'll just say we left our pants at home...

01:02.192 --> 01:03.724
...or something stupid.

01:04.343 --> 01:06.862
We don't reveal the prank 'cause you never reveal a prank.

01:06.975 --> 01:10.399
Yeah, I started and I took the E train up to 53rd,...

01:10.672 --> 01:14.123
...transferred onto the Six train, and here I am in Union Square.

01:14.632 --> 01:18.479
A lot of questions, a lot of questions like, "Where are your pants?"

01:18.615 --> 01:20.015
"What's with the no pants?"

01:22.516 --> 01:24.240
Yeah, basically something like that.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.586
So, here's a little kid that was looking over and goes,...

01:26.695 --> 01:28.415
..."Mommy, why don't these people have pants on?"

01:28.527 --> 01:30.931
She was, "Just stop looking. Look away, look away!"

01:31.028 --> 01:31.459
"Don't look at them."

01:32.346 --> 01:35.655
You know, personally I woke up this morning, I was in a really big hurry to meet my friends in the city,...

01:36.061 --> 01:39.947
...and I just forgot my pants, and this is my last pair of underwear, my last pair of socks.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.307
So frankly, being the scatterbrained person I am, I'm not surprised that I forgot my pants,...

01:44.979 --> 01:48.208
...but then I came and like all my friends also didn't have their pants on,...

01:48.292 --> 01:50.506
...so it was a little strange, but I don't know.
