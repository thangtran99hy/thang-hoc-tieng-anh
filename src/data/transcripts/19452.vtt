Gene Menzies saved more than 400 dollars on this computer...

00:07.990 --> 00:10.723
...and 150 dollars on this audio system.

00:11.253 --> 00:15.315
When he bought his new TV, he got a 100-dollar gift certificate thrown in.

00:15.670 --> 00:19.170
And he got all that by bargaining online.

00:19.379 --> 00:23.920
When I buy online and do some of this bargaining, I'm probably saving...

00:24.757 --> 00:28.087
...10 to 20 percent over what I find in the store.

00:28.257 --> 00:31.105
Gene is one of more than 26,000 subscribers...

00:31.197 --> 00:34.138
...Consumer Reports surveyed on buying electronics.

00:34.303 --> 00:36.299
We found that people who bargained online...

00:36.563 --> 00:39.997
...were just as successful as those who bargained inside the stores themselves.

00:40.375 --> 00:42.620
Whether you're online or in a store,...

00:42.888 --> 00:46.479
...people had the most success haggling for prices on TVs,...

00:46.817 --> 00:49.877
...saving an average of 165 dollars,...

00:50.354 --> 00:54.755
...and computer buyers saved an average of 105 dollars in another survey.

00:55.450 --> 00:57.380
So, how do you get the prices down?

00:57.828 --> 01:00.366
First, check online for the lowest price,...

01:00.739 --> 01:03.979
...then print out what you found and take it to the store.

01:04.449 --> 01:06.633
Or if you're bargaining online like Gene,...

01:07.005 --> 01:09.278
...call the website's customer service number.

01:09.380 --> 01:12.573
I'd say I found it at X Y Z store for this amount.

01:13.567 --> 01:14.157
Can you beat it?

01:14.413 --> 01:18.586
And if you're buying more than one item, Gene's got another bargaining trick.

01:18.989 --> 01:21.844
I just said, "Look, I want two of these things. What can you do?"

01:21.975 --> 01:23.321
And so they gave me 10 percent off.

01:23.549 --> 01:26.585
Those negotiating techniques work in stores too,...

01:27.003 --> 01:31.480
...and if you can't get the price down, ask for free accessories or free shipping.
