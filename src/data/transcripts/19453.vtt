00:04.068 --> 00:05.793
Election night in Chicago,...

00:06.095 --> 00:09.037
...and Obama supporters celebrate their victory.

00:10.136 --> 00:12.628
I return to the White House more determined...

00:12.970 --> 00:16.081
...and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do...

00:16.384 --> 00:17.908
...and the future that lies ahead.

00:20.733 --> 00:24.388
But Mr. Obama had little time to enjoy his triumph.

00:25.449 --> 00:29.788
The president once again assumed the role of national healer-in-chief...

00:30.215 --> 00:33.616
...in the wake of the tragic school shootings in Newtown, Connecticut.

00:34.613 --> 00:35.939
We can't tolerate this anymore.

00:39.547 --> 00:40.675
These tragedies must end,...

00:43.563 --> 00:44.991
...and to end them, we must change.

00:46.575 --> 00:49.225
Mr. Obama is also trying to find a compromise...

00:49.297 --> 00:52.329
...on deficit reduction with congressional Republicans...

00:52.798 --> 00:58.507
...to head off a half-trillion dollars' worth of tax hikes and budget cuts by the end of the year.

00:59.365 --> 01:02.420
The president's reelection is a chance to start over,...

01:02.791 --> 01:06.201
...says former Reagan White House Chief of Staff Ken Duberstein.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.899
People are giving President Obama a second chance,...

01:11.310 --> 01:15.261
...perhaps to validate the promise he made in 2008,...

01:16.244 --> 01:19.225
...which was fundamentally to transform Washington...

01:19.298 --> 01:21.976
...in the way we work together or not work together.

01:22.260 --> 01:25.855
It's also a chance for Republicans to make a fresh start,...

01:26.294 --> 01:28.881
...says Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution.

01:29.154 --> 01:34.816
It's not tenable for Republicans simply to stay in opposition...

01:35.321 --> 01:39.307
...for the whole second term of President Obama.

01:39.657 --> 01:46.981
And if they are seen as the obstacle to doing anything to solve our problems,...

01:50.587 --> 01:53.205
...they're writing their own death certificate.

01:53.308 --> 01:55.863
But tough decisions on taxes and spending...

01:56.211 --> 02:01.865
...could also see the president demand concessions from his own party, says Duberstein.

02:02.365 --> 02:08.809
The major part of leadership is occasionally saying no to your strongest allies...

02:09.531 --> 02:12.709
...and yes to some of your fiercest opponents.

02:13.354 --> 02:14.661
You got to bring people together.

02:15.195 --> 02:20.231
President Obama will be officially sworn in for a second term on January 20th,...

02:20.578 --> 02:24.150
...with the public inauguration ceremony the following day.

02:24.681 --> 02:27.509
