00:00.050 --> 00:01.495
You are amazing at your job,...

00:02.659 --> 00:04.093
...and so one day you had an epiphany.

00:04.550 --> 00:07.695
Why am I working for some other dude who I don't even like that much...

00:07.974 --> 00:09.559
...when I can start my own business?

00:09.893 --> 00:10.853
Congratulations!

00:11.046 --> 00:12.031
You're an entrepreneur.

00:12.723 --> 00:14.375
Wait, hold it right there, muchacho.

00:14.617 --> 00:17.139
Starting a business doesn't actually make you an entrepreneur.

00:17.507 --> 00:19.392
And like many so-called entrepreneurs,...

00:19.693 --> 00:22.037
...you'll soon find yourself working 15-hour days.

00:22.389 --> 00:23.789
You'll be hiring the wrong people...

00:23.970 --> 00:25.688
...and getting frustrated trying to manage them.

00:26.301 --> 00:29.168
And you won't know how to fix the systems that make a great business grow.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.787
Suddenly, you realize you didn't create a business.

00:32.016 --> 00:33.956
You really just created yourself a new job,...

00:34.333 --> 00:36.082
...and this new job kinda sucks.

00:36.719 --> 00:37.389
Here's the problem.

00:37.693 --> 00:39.374
The first thing you should have asked yourself is:...

00:39.543 --> 00:41.057
..."Am I actually an entrepreneur?"

00:41.529 --> 00:43.011
Because not everyone is.

00:43.518 --> 00:46.351
Yeah, see, people generally fall into one of three buckets.

00:46.809 --> 00:49.269
Technicians, people who are good at doing the work,...

00:49.757 --> 00:53.157
...managers, people who are good at managing the systems people work in,...

00:53.644 --> 00:58.273
...and entrepreneurs, people who love building new opportunities out of, well, nothing.

00:58.759 --> 01:02.001
Now, most people fall into the first two categories, right?

01:02.213 --> 01:03.358
Like take Mike for example.

01:03.851 --> 01:07.278
The reason Mike wanted his own shop was because he was a great cupcake baker.

01:07.841 --> 01:09.637
But then he found out a very hard lesson.

01:10.197 --> 01:13.895
When a technician tries to be a manager or an entrepreneur, it just doesn't work.

01:14.530 --> 01:17.777
So if you want to start a business, first decide what kind of person are you,...

01:18.293 --> 01:21.017
...then find partners who can help you in the other areas.
