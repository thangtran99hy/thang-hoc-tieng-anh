All the things that you need to get done are stored all over:...

00:03.000 --> 00:04.174
...in your e-mail inbox,...

00:04.251 --> 00:06.040
...on random pieces of paper,...

00:06.281 --> 00:07.221
...or in your brain.

00:07.489 --> 00:09.279
You often forget to do things.

00:09.361 --> 00:11.540
You get overwhelmed by big tasks,...

00:11.610 --> 00:13.953
...and overall, your mind feels cluttered.

00:14.407 --> 00:16.858
If you want to be a ninja at getting things done,...

00:16.931 --> 00:17.861
...you need a system.

00:18.123 --> 00:19.265
Here are some tips.

00:19.488 --> 00:22.139
First, collect everything you have to do in one place.

00:22.361 --> 00:26.288
This is a big brain dump where you can write down any task that comes to mind.

00:26.740 --> 00:28.683
Whenever you think of something you have to do,...

00:28.791 --> 00:31.126
...don't store it in your prefrontal cortex.

00:31.411 --> 00:32.237
Write it down.

00:32.738 --> 00:34.495
We call this your "inbox."

00:34.668 --> 00:36.283
Next, put things from your inbox...

00:36.399 --> 00:39.141
...into a place you know you will look at, at the right time.

00:39.512 --> 00:42.456
This might be your calendar, a shopping list,...

00:42.619 --> 00:43.929
...or in a project folder.

00:44.173 --> 00:45.277
Speaking of projects,...

00:45.350 --> 00:48.050
...if a task can't be done without a series of steps,...

00:48.153 --> 00:50.490
...then you need to turn that task into a project...

00:50.713 --> 00:54.778
...by brainstorming every individual step required to complete that project.

00:55.021 --> 00:56.842
Start practicing these simple things...

00:56.917 --> 00:58.604
...and you'll find that your mind is clear,...

00:58.858 --> 01:01.617
...and you're knocking out tasks one at a time.
