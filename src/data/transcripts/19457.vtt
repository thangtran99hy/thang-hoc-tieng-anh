In this recession, don't stop spending.

00:06.329 --> 00:08.095
Haggle your way to better prices.

00:08.462 --> 00:11.334
A Consumer Reports poll says that 81 percent of consumers...

00:11.509 --> 00:13.980
...haggle their way to cheaper clothes.

00:14.332 --> 00:18.431
Retailers want to sell their inventory and will give discount on the spot.

00:18.569 --> 00:20.473
And yes, even you can do it.

00:20.643 --> 00:22.451
First, look them in the eye.

00:22.667 --> 00:27.693
If you find the perfect jeans, find the best price then bargain.

00:27.845 --> 00:30.719
Tell them you will walk if they don't give you a better price.

00:30.797 --> 00:33.057
Buy in bulk, save money.

00:33.208 --> 00:35.215
Buying shoes, slacks and a sweater?

00:35.751 --> 00:36.557
Tell them you want a discount.

00:36.772 --> 00:39.468
Because remember, salespeople work on commission.

00:39.634 --> 00:40.603
Be friendly.

00:40.687 --> 00:43.804
Salespeople will be more likely to give you a discount, tell you about sales...

00:43.893 --> 00:45.902
...and might even let you use their employee discount.

00:46.190 --> 00:48.563
Don't pay full price, all you got to do is ask.
