Clutter, clutter everywhere,...

00:08.186 --> 00:10.125
...not a drop of free space anywhere.

00:10.544 --> 00:13.555
Dawn Sandomeno was drowning in her messy home office,...

00:13.789 --> 00:16.943
...so she and her partner were forced to work at the dining room table.

00:17.292 --> 00:19.373
My clutter issue is basically paper,...

00:20.421 --> 00:23.427
...things that I need to file away, and the other thing in the room...

00:23.538 --> 00:27.739
...is I think we're having an issue of whether it's a gym or an office,...

00:27.837 --> 00:29.551
...and really, it's some sort of bedroom.

00:29.704 --> 00:32.448
So, the whole issue is stressing us out.

00:32.675 --> 00:35.421
Good Housekeeping sent in clutter expert Lorie Marrero...

00:35.551 --> 00:39.311
...with an organizing program designed to get Dawn's space in shape,...

00:39.675 --> 00:43.598
...beginning with this vision board purchased from a used furniture store.

00:43.821 --> 00:46.818
This is for you to manage your to-do list and your projects,...

00:47.639 --> 00:50.649
...and we've set it up here with some of your stuff from your business.

00:50.879 --> 00:52.139
This is exactly what I needed,...

00:52.213 --> 00:54.887
...and the fact that I can close it up is even better.

00:55.185 --> 00:55.699
Terrific!

00:56.272 --> 00:59.513
Marrero says, "Keep a to-be-filed box on your desk,...

00:59.601 --> 01:03.243
...and once it fills up, you've got a physical cue to file the material."

01:03.657 --> 01:06.089
I'm Terry Anzur for Good Housekeeping Reports.
