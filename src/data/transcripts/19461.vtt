00:06.173 --> 00:08.923
With the holidays and guests fast approaching,...

00:09.032 --> 00:11.837
...Good Housekeeping's Cleaning Director Carolyn Forte...

00:11.925 --> 00:14.757
...has a few steps to a cleaner kitchen fast.

00:15.083 --> 00:17.783
You'll need all your counter space this holiday season for cooking...

00:17.903 --> 00:21.705
...so make sure you gather any mail, catalogs, takeout menus...

00:21.843 --> 00:25.651
...and hide them in a drawer or a cabinet until your guests leave.

00:26.297 --> 00:30.666
Next, stash the kitchen appliances you don't use a lot in an out-of-the-way spot.

00:31.055 --> 00:31.967
On to the oven.

00:32.213 --> 00:35.684
It's a good idea to find a little time before the holidays to self clean your oven.

00:35.863 --> 00:37.823
It's guaranteed your guests are gonna be peeking in.

00:38.203 --> 00:40.942
If you don't have time, just clean the oven glass,...

00:41.197 --> 00:44.065
...remove all of the grease with a little baking soda on a sponge...

00:44.349 --> 00:45.788
...and go over the handle as well.

00:46.307 --> 00:47.467
And in the refrigerator.

00:47.655 --> 00:50.791
Extra shelf space in the refrigerator is crucial this time of year...

00:50.889 --> 00:54.666
...so make sure that you toss any half-used bottles of barbecue sauce,...

00:55.059 --> 00:58.161
...grilling marinades, things that you really won't be using 'til next summer.

00:58.726 --> 01:02.499
Rinse a sponge in plain water and go over the shelves,...

01:02.659 --> 01:05.067
...clean the glass shelves of any spots or spills...

01:05.973 --> 01:09.069
...and make sure you do the same with the fronts of the vegetable bins.

01:10.515 --> 01:12.190
And pop in a fresh batch of baking soda.

01:12.475 --> 01:16.424
Just finish up with a quick wipe of the refrigerator fronts and the door handles.

01:16.793 --> 01:20.871
And finally, use a disposable electrostatic sweeper like a Swiffer...

01:21.005 --> 01:23.845
...to quickly pick up crumbs, dust and hair from the floor.

01:24.106 --> 01:26.823
As you mop, keep a damp paper towel in your hand...

01:26.922 --> 01:29.171
...to zap any stains and sticky drips.

01:29.785 --> 01:32.318
I'm Elizabeth McGuire for Good Housekeeping Reports.
