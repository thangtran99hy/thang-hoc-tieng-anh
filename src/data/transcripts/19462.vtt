00:00.667 --> 00:01.396
What are you?

00:01.977 --> 00:03.193
I'm Gotham's reckoning.

00:03.893 --> 00:08.086
When Chris Nolan's film, "The Dark Knight Rises" came out in July,...

00:08.599 --> 00:11.982
...the on-screen death and destruction served as the backdrop...

00:12.184 --> 00:16.197
...to a mass shooting during its premiere in Aurora, Colorado.

00:16.813 --> 00:19.375
The shooter, 24-year-old James Holmes,...

00:19.495 --> 00:24.015
...had dyed his hair red to resemble the Batman character, "The Joker."

00:24.611 --> 00:27.965
Holmes killed 12 people and wounded 58.

00:29.453 --> 00:32.697
Production of violent films continued after the massacre.

00:34.376 --> 00:38.358
One of them, Andrew Dominik's graphic drama, "Killing Them Softly,"

00:38.763 --> 00:42.934
...about a hired gun with feelings, was released late November.

00:43.555 --> 00:47.100
I like to kill them softly from a distance,...

00:47.558 --> 00:49.049
...not close enough for feelings.

00:49.139 --> 00:50.737
Don't like feelings. Don't wanna think about them.

00:51.716 --> 00:56.288
The Hollywood premiere this week of Quentin Tarantino's bloody western,...

00:56.565 --> 01:01.415
..."Django Unchained," was canceled out of respect for those killed in Connecticut,...

01:01.893 --> 01:03.970
...though the movie will be released.

01:04.037 --> 01:07.202
You kill people, and they give you a reward?

01:07.530 --> 01:08.952
The badder they are, the bigger the reward.

01:11.238 --> 01:14.275
Criminal defense attorney Rene Sandler says...

01:14.501 --> 01:18.065
...on-screen gunfights can inspire real-life shootings.

01:18.216 --> 01:20.656
The perpetrator becomes a character,...

01:20.993 --> 01:27.403
...takes on the persona of an aggressive or violent individual or superhero.

01:27.830 --> 01:30.747
And in Aurora, it's a perfect example of just that.

01:31.465 --> 01:34.156
But Sandler says, even more than films,...

01:34.379 --> 01:37.848
...violent video games are at the core of brutal behavior,...

01:38.463 --> 01:40.740
...and she says they should be regulated.

01:42.643 --> 01:48.714
I've seen clients who have engaged in that interactive video experience,...

01:48.813 --> 01:51.293
...where they're killing, where they're using guns,...

01:51.635 --> 01:58.531
...where they're gaining points and winning, given the more bodies that they amass.

02:01.783 --> 02:05.715
Sandler says on-screen violence itself is not dangerous,...

02:05.943 --> 02:10.215
...but it can be "weaponized" in the hands of people with mental issues.

02:10.902 --> 02:14.554
Law enforcement authorities in the Connecticut shooting have said very little...

02:14.863 --> 02:18.896
...about the 20-year-old shooter Adam Lanza's mental health.

02:19.467 --> 02:22.006
But the elementary school attack has raised the issue,...

02:22.425 --> 02:25.689
...and many are calling on society to be more vigilant.

02:27.061 --> 02:32.276
A gaming industry group calls any link between video games and violence a myth.

02:32.709 --> 02:35.306
And following the movie theater massacre in July,...

02:35.719 --> 02:39.805
...a movie industry mogul suggested a summit on violence and film,...

02:40.219 --> 02:42.138
...which has not yet been convened.

02:43.668 --> 02:45.346
Doesn't Kevin go to Gladstone High?

02:45.905 --> 02:50.755
Still, an Oscar-nominated movie last year, "We Need to Talk About Kevin,"...

02:51.249 --> 02:53.603
...eerily mirrors the Newtown shooting.

02:54.384 --> 02:56.738
The 16-year-old upper-class Kevin,...

02:56.996 --> 03:00.917
...goes on a killing spree at his high school after murdering his family.

03:01.701 --> 03:06.276
The movie raises noted questions about teen mental health,...

03:06.700 --> 03:10.348
...family breakdown and violence in American society.

03:11.539 --> 03:14.791
