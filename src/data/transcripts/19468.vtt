The Hope Diamond has long been the undisputed star of the museum,...

00:05.903 --> 00:10.315
...but it was upstaged recently at the unveiling of a new gem:...

00:10.788 --> 00:12.814
...the Dom Pedro Aquamarine.

00:17.077 --> 00:21.217
Visitors vied with the media to get a photo of the iridescent obelisk,...

00:21.574 --> 00:26.854
...which stands more than 35 centimeters high and weighs two kilograms.

00:28.187 --> 00:33.048
It is the largest cut and polished gem aquamarine in the world.

00:34.118 --> 00:37.699
Jeffrey Post is curator of the museum's mineral collection.

00:38.803 --> 00:42.069
It's very rare, very unusual for any mineral...

00:42.688 --> 00:45.483
...to produce a crystal the size and the quality...

00:45.877 --> 00:49.432
...that could result in cutting a stone like the Dom Pedro.

00:49.801 --> 00:53.242
And most would be cut into wearable gems like these,...

00:54.003 --> 00:56.817
...and that ultimately would've been the fate of the Dom Pedro,...

00:57.174 --> 01:02.859
...had it not been for wealthy gem collectors Jane Mitchell and her husband Jeffrey Bland.

01:03.295 --> 01:05.591
I thought that would be such a loss,...

01:06.048 --> 01:08.515
...so that's when my husband and I stepped forward and said,...

01:08.589 --> 01:10.003
"Well, we'd like to purchase it."

01:10.389 --> 01:13.029
We had no desire to hold on to it privately.

01:13.421 --> 01:18.051
We felt it should strike awe in as many people as could be...

01:18.127 --> 01:20.067
...because that's how we felt when we looked at it.

01:20.259 --> 01:26.161
That's why they donated the Dom Pedro to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.

01:26.865 --> 01:29.742
With 7.4 million visitors last year,...

01:29.898 --> 01:31.137
Whoa, that's weird.

01:31.323 --> 01:34.406
...it is the most popular museum in the United States,...

01:34.749 --> 01:36.985
...due in large part, to the Hope Diamond.

01:37.770 --> 01:41.484
Now, visitors have another breathtaking reason to come here.
