00:16.221 --> 00:16.909
Picture this.

00:17.449 --> 00:19.294
Your friend and you are watching a sitcom...

00:19.806 --> 00:24.070
...and a sassy sidekick walks into a room, carrying a four-tiered wedding cake.

00:24.653 --> 00:27.400
He trips, falls, and face-plants into the cake.

00:28.168 --> 00:30.569
Your friend doubles over with laughter and says,...

00:30.899 --> 00:32.101
..."So ridiculous!"

00:32.223 --> 00:33.193
"So ironic!"

00:34.167 --> 00:35.461
Well, quick, what do you do?

00:35.905 --> 00:37.641
Do you laugh along with the laugh track...

00:37.727 --> 00:40.493
...and let this grievous misinterpretation of irony go,...

00:40.952 --> 00:44.249
...or you throw caution to the wind and explain the true meaning of irony?

00:44.875 --> 00:46.949
If you're me, you'd choose the latter.

00:48.242 --> 00:51.442
Unfortunately, irony has been completely misunderstood.

00:52.223 --> 00:56.706
We tend to throw out that term whenever we see something funny or coincidental.

00:57.123 --> 00:59.983
And while many examples of true irony can be funny,...

01:00.519 --> 01:02.936
...that is not the driving factor of being ironic.

01:03.801 --> 01:09.341
A situation is only ironic if what happens is the exact opposite of what was expected.

01:10.059 --> 01:14.060
If you expect A, but get B, then you have irony.

01:14.355 --> 01:17.120
Let's take the slapstick cake situation as an example.

01:17.391 --> 01:21.791
When someone walks in, precariously balancing something that shouldn't be carried alone,...

01:22.222 --> 01:24.355
...trips, falls, and makes a mess,...

01:24.581 --> 01:26.715
...it is funny, but it's not ironic.

01:26.987 --> 01:31.871
In fact, you probably expect someone who is single-handedly carrying a huge cake to trip.

01:32.075 --> 01:35.369
When he does, reality aligns with expectations,...

01:35.837 --> 01:37.533
...and so that is not irony.
