00:00.025 --> 00:01.139
It's payday!

00:01.369 --> 00:04.249
Put that check in the bank and get ready to party.

00:04.724 --> 00:06.926
Now you can finally pay some overdue bills,...

00:07.263 --> 00:08.839
...buy that gear you've been eyeing...

00:09.037 --> 00:10.695
...and stock the refrigerator.

00:11.077 --> 00:14.877
That is, until the end of the month when the next payday is still days away.

00:15.186 --> 00:16.453
More bills are piling up.

00:16.721 --> 00:17.924
The refrigerator is empty.

00:18.184 --> 00:21.834
Checks are bouncing and you don't have money in the bank to put gas in the car.

00:22.245 --> 00:24.623
Living paycheck to paycheck is tough,...

00:24.953 --> 00:28.290
...but there is a system that will make sure you always have the cash you need.

00:28.604 --> 00:30.153
It's called the envelope system.

00:30.580 --> 00:32.956
Instead of depositing that check into your bank account,...

00:33.105 --> 00:34.733
...cash that check and bring it home.

00:35.099 --> 00:37.271
Make envelopes for every budget item you have...

00:37.641 --> 00:40.895
...like gas, food, rent and so on.

00:41.187 --> 00:43.719
Then put the appropriate amount of cash in each envelope.

00:44.017 --> 00:47.724
When you want to buy something, only use cash from the correct envelope.

00:48.121 --> 00:51.138
This makes it so you won't overspend in any one category,...

00:51.543 --> 00:53.852
...and you always have money for things you need.
