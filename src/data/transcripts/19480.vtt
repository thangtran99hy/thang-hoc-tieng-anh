00:00.071 --> 00:05.589
Throughout the Asia Pacific region, most businesses are quite optimistic, going forward.

00:05.836 --> 00:06.633
It's a very good reading.

00:06.842 --> 00:09.908
When you break down this survey, it gets quite interesting...

00:09.980 --> 00:15.513
...the Philippines was the most positive country with an index reading of 100.

00:15.950 --> 00:17.627
Is business booming there?

00:19.391 --> 00:22.755
Absolutely, I think that there is something happening in the Philippines,...

00:22.821 --> 00:26.179
...it has been quite positive for the past few observations.

00:26.639 --> 00:30.217
And I think that if you look at the data there is a good reason to think that...

00:30.516 --> 00:33.171
...this is not just some crazy optimism,...

00:33.624 --> 00:36.924
...indeed the Philippines has been growing at about five percent.

00:37.043 --> 00:39.621
We expect it to grow again five percent this year.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.659
The first quarter was amazing.

00:41.983 --> 00:44.422
Inflation seems to be under control.

00:44.500 --> 00:45.975
The peso is appreciating.

00:46.620 --> 00:51.760
The stock market has been going up so we have about 13 percent return year-to-date...

00:52.206 --> 00:58.407
...so I think this optimism is backed by solid economic data at least so far...

00:58.561 --> 01:01.813
...and we might be up for a very positive surprise in the near future.
