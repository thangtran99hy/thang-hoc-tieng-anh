00:02.617 --> 00:05.022
For 13 years, you didn't just deny it;...

00:05.144 --> 00:10.547
...you brazenly and defiantly denied everything you just admitted just now.

00:10.619 --> 00:12.389
So, why now admit it?

00:12.564 --> 00:13.542
That's the best question.

00:13.996 --> 00:15.269
It's the most logical question.

00:19.064 --> 00:20.602
I don't know that I have a great answer.

00:22.169 --> 00:26.087
I will start my answer by saying that this is too late.

00:27.216 --> 00:32.065
It's too late for probably most people,...

00:33.817 --> 00:36.092
...and that's my fault.

00:40.796 --> 00:47.549
I viewed this situation as one big lie that I repeated a lot of times,...

00:47.792 --> 00:52.863
...and as you said, it wasn't as if I just said no and I moved off it.

00:52.996 --> 00:54.420
Right, you were defiant.

00:54.493 --> 00:54.854
Oh yes.

00:56.649 --> 00:58.380
You called other people liars.

00:58.774 --> 00:59.531
I understand that.

01:00.309 --> 01:05.055
And while I've lived through this process,...

01:05.123 --> 01:09.441
...especially the last two years; one year, six months; two, three months,...

01:12.523 --> 01:13.253
...I know the truth.

01:15.531 --> 01:16.951
The truth isn't what was out there.

01:17.031 --> 01:18.572
The truth isn't what I said.

01:21.049 --> 01:22.237
And now, it's gone.

01:23.950 --> 01:25.959
This story was so perfect for so long.

01:28.132 --> 01:32.837
And I mean that, as I try to take myself out of the situation and I look at it.

01:33.245 --> 01:34.526
You overcome the disease,...

01:35.096 --> 01:36.960
...you win the Tour de France seven times.

01:37.049 --> 01:38.841
You have a happy marriage, you have children.

01:38.910 --> 01:42.509
I mean, it's just this mythic, perfect story,...

01:42.692 --> 01:42.863
Yes.

01:42.937 --> 01:43.594
...and it wasn't true.

01:44.234 --> 01:45.179
And that wasn't true.

01:45.665 --> 01:47.787
And that was not true on a lot of levels.
