00:02.661 --> 00:04.255
So, here we are in Austin, Texas.

00:05.311 --> 00:09.003
A few days ago, you texted it to the Associated Press and said,...

00:09.879 --> 00:14.741
..."I told her to go wherever she wants", "her" meaning me,...

00:15.489 --> 00:20.123
..."and I'll answer the questions directly, honestly, and candidly."

00:20.639 --> 00:21.501
"That's all I can say."

00:22.165 --> 00:22.828
Those are your words.

00:24.001 --> 00:24.683
Those are my words.

00:25.119 --> 00:29.523
When we first met a week ago today, we agreed that there would be no holds barred,...

00:29.695 --> 00:31.899
...there would be no conditions on this interview,....

00:31.997 --> 00:33.591
...and that this would be an open field.

00:35.388 --> 00:36.721
I think that's best for both of us.

00:36.893 --> 00:37.657
Alright, I agree.

00:38.165 --> 00:39.755
So, here we go open field.

00:41.165 --> 00:43.703
So, let's start with the questions that people around the world...

00:43.799 --> 00:45.271
...have been waiting for you to answer,...

00:45.381 --> 00:49.240
...and for now, I just like a "yes" or "no".

00:49.379 --> 00:49.552
Okay.

00:49.774 --> 00:50.102
Okay?

00:50.728 --> 00:54.357
This whole conversation, we have a lot of time, will be about the details.

00:55.048 --> 00:59.788
Yes or no: did you ever take banned substances to enhance your cycling performance?

01:00.010 --> 01:00.265
Yes.

01:02.641 --> 01:06.259
Yes or no: was one of those banned substances EPO?

01:06.601 --> 01:06.819
Yes.

01:08.474 --> 01:13.539
Did you ever blood dope or use blood transfusions to enhance your cycling performance?

01:13.708 --> 01:13.897
Yes.

01:15.979 --> 01:18.467
Did you ever use any other banned substances...

01:18.578 --> 01:22.171
...like testosterone, cortisone, or human growth hormone?

01:23.086 --> 01:23.413
Yes.

01:25.421 --> 01:30.614
Yes or no: in all seven of your Tour de France victories,...

01:31.017 --> 01:34.372
...did you ever take banned substances or blood dope?

01:34.573 --> 01:34.881
Yes.

01:36.698 --> 01:42.664
In your opinion, was it humanly possible to win the Tour de France without doping...

01:43.522 --> 01:44.601
...seven times in a row?

01:46.305 --> 01:47.204
Not in my opinion.

01:49.051 --> 01:51.623
So, when did you first start doping?

01:52.339 --> 01:53.405
We're done with the yes and nos?

01:53.779 --> 01:54.898
We're done with the yes and nos.

01:56.543 --> 02:00.619
I suppose earlier in my career there was cortisone,...

02:00.700 --> 02:06.476
...and then the EPO generation began.

02:08.276 --> 02:08.817
Began when?

02:10.105 --> 02:11.001
For me or for?

02:11.195 --> 02:11.581
For you.

02:12.642 --> 02:13.257
Mid 90s.

02:13.610 --> 02:14.296
Mid 90s.
