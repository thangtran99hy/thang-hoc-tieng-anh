Ultrabook: Inspired by Intel.

00:04.625 --> 00:08.648
...unicorns, zebras, you in your underwear, in space.

00:08.879 --> 00:11.118
This is the perfect project for you right now.

00:11.394 --> 00:11.938
Where are you going?

00:13.667 --> 00:15.381
We all have our hidden passions.

00:16.182 --> 00:19.776
For Megan Fox, this is a passion for marine life.

00:20.236 --> 00:23.699
That's why we designed the new Acer Aspire S7 Ultrabook,...

00:23.933 --> 00:27.342
...so Megan could follow her dream and talk to dolphins.

00:27.421 --> 00:31.387
...that would enable us to start to hear dolphins in an entirely new way.

00:31.777 --> 00:32.527
Brilliant!

00:32.740 --> 00:33.605
You're brilliant.

00:35.707 --> 00:36.441
Hi, everybody!

00:36.709 --> 00:37.927
Oh, welcome!

00:39.291 --> 00:40.601
And this is Zenya.

00:42.170 --> 00:42.615
Hi!

00:43.801 --> 00:44.374
How's it going?

00:44.636 --> 00:46.709
Try increasing the high frequency by ten percent.

00:47.313 --> 00:48.549
Are the microphones in position?

00:50.409 --> 00:50.715
Egg.

00:51.297 --> 00:51.603
Oh yeah.

00:54.189 --> 00:54.577
Fish.

00:57.739 --> 00:58.801
I don't know what this one is either.

00:59.898 --> 01:03.631
She stopped close to him, her hands rose, and dropped on his shoulder.

01:04.173 --> 01:05.435
Hey, should we try this again?

01:05.782 --> 01:06.029
Let's go.

01:06.442 --> 01:06.980
Zenya?

01:09.545 --> 01:11.295
We need to adjust there.

01:12.805 --> 01:13.287
Hello.

01:14.860 --> 01:16.139
Hello Megan.

01:25.428 --> 01:26.586
Don't I get a hug?
