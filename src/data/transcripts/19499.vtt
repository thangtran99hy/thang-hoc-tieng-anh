00:01.829 --> 00:02.627
This summer...

00:04.879 --> 00:06.359
...a dragon is coming.

00:07.421 --> 00:08.983
Come on you beast!

00:11.427 --> 00:13.137
Stay together and we live!

00:14.311 --> 00:16.283
No, a slightly smaller dragon.

00:17.205 --> 00:18.050
Tiny really.

00:19.473 --> 00:21.595
But faster, way faster.

00:23.209 --> 00:25.549
And cuter, but not that cute.

00:27.833 --> 00:29.077
A dragon that's smarter,...

00:30.644 --> 00:31.389
...more advanced;...

00:33.939 --> 00:36.371
...can multitask and doesn't waste power.

00:37.754 --> 00:40.165
This summer, a dragon is coming,...

00:40.591 --> 00:41.372
...not to a theater,...

00:41.839 --> 00:43.523
...not to an enchanted little village.

00:43.925 --> 00:47.285
Nope, this dragon is coming to your phone.

00:49.443 --> 00:51.652
Well technically, in your phone.

00:52.041 --> 00:55.331
Make sure your next phone has the blockbuster speed and performance...

00:55.447 --> 00:56.783
...hundreds of millions already love.

00:56.921 --> 00:59.581
Make sure it has a Snapdragon processor.
