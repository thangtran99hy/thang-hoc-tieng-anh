Vice President Biden, Mr. Chief Justice,...

00:05.977 --> 00:08.267
...members of the United States Congress,...

00:09.460 --> 00:13.083
...distinguished guests and fellow citizens.

00:16.442 --> 00:19.229
Each time we gather to inaugurate a President...

00:21.033 --> 00:25.497
...we bear witness to the enduring strength of our constitution.

00:28.167 --> 00:30.615
We affirm the promise of our democracy.

00:32.808 --> 00:37.513
We recall that what binds this nation together is not the colors of our skin,...

00:38.283 --> 00:40.267
...or the tenets of our faith,...

00:41.687 --> 00:43.835
...or the origins of our names.

00:46.140 --> 00:47.363
What makes us exceptional,...

00:49.151 --> 00:50.691
...what makes us American,...

00:52.499 --> 00:58.537
...is our allegiance to an idea articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago.

01:01.548 --> 01:04.118
"We hold these truths to be self-evident,..."

01:06.338 --> 01:08.459
"...that all men are created equal,..."

01:13.865 --> 01:19.255
"...that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights..."

01:21.473 --> 01:27.561
"...that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."

01:30.616 --> 01:34.444
Today, we continue a never-ending journey...

01:35.173 --> 01:39.917
...to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time.
