Today, I'm gonna show you how to make chicken kebabs.

00:05.577 --> 00:08.835
It sounds delicious, and believe me, it tastes delicious.

00:09.305 --> 00:12.263
So watch this video and have a go at making them.

00:13.369 --> 00:18.716
So, in this plate, we have one teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon of coriander powder,...

00:19.157 --> 00:25.665
...one teaspoon of cumin powder, one teaspoon of red chili powder, and one teaspoon of garam masala.

00:26.389 --> 00:28.817
In this plate, we have two green chilies, finely chopped,...

00:29.317 --> 00:34.348
...two teaspoons of crushed garlic and ginger, some coriander,...

00:34.755 --> 00:40.279
...one slice of bread, broken into small pieces, and half an onion, finely chopped,...

00:41.077 --> 00:42.583
...and in the middle, we have an egg,...

00:43.752 --> 00:47.105
...and in this bowl, we have one pound of chicken mince.

00:47.684 --> 00:54.355
Okay, so first of all, we're going to add all the spices into the bowl of minced chicken,...

00:54.501 --> 00:57.059
...so I'll put the spices in there.

01:01.643 --> 01:10.063
Then we're going to add the bread crumbs, the coriander, ginger paste, green chilies, and onion.

01:11.915 --> 01:13.981
And finally, we're also going to add in the egg,...

01:17.487 --> 01:21.691
...and then we're going to stir the whole mixture around.

01:25.959 --> 01:27.804
So, after a few minutes of mixing,...

01:28.837 --> 01:32.887
...the kebab mix should be ready for me to now start making the kebabs.

01:33.199 --> 01:36.951
Using a clean pair of hands, I'm now going to begin making the kebabs,...

01:37.051 --> 01:45.769
...so you get the minced meat in your hands, squeeze it, and then roll it out into a circular shape.

01:47.087 --> 01:48.523
There you go, and put it onto a plate.

01:48.986 --> 01:52.936
And here, I've got several chicken kebabs ready for me to fry.

01:53.755 --> 01:58.187
So, put some oil into a pan and turn the cooker on, so the oil is now hot.

01:58.855 --> 02:01.310
I will now add the kebabs into the pan.

02:19.709 --> 02:23.174
So, let this cook 'til one side becomes a golden brown color.

02:25.317 --> 02:28.635
You can see the kebabs are getting cooked.

02:29.121 --> 02:32.997
After about a minute or so, you turn the kebabs around,...

02:34.215 --> 02:37.129
...and you can see, it's turned to a nice brown color,...

02:38.504 --> 02:44.299
...so you just do the same with the other kebabs. Like this.

02:46.238 --> 02:47.174
Just turn them all around,...

02:49.549 --> 02:51.591
...and this I will cook for about two more minutes.

02:52.424 --> 02:54.842
So you can see the kebabs are cooking very nicely there.

02:56.571 --> 02:57.251
Almost done.

02:59.498 --> 03:02.627
Okay, so the kebabs are now ready to be served,...

03:02.712 --> 03:07.977
...so put a plate here, and I'm going to empty the kebabs into the plate.

03:15.236 --> 03:20.843
And there, you can see the kebabs are nicely cooked and ready for me to eat and enjoy.
