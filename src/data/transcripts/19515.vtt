00:00.462 --> 00:01.615
Where are you from originally?

00:01.783 --> 00:02.225
Kentucky.

00:02.422 --> 00:02.973
Kentucky.

00:03.367 --> 00:05.289
And how is your mother enjoying your success?

00:05.707 --> 00:07.299
Oh, she's very happy.

00:07.384 --> 00:08.284
She has more fun than I do.

00:08.355 --> 00:09.289
She called me one time.

00:09.775 --> 00:12.606
Recently I've just gotten into the Academy which was really exciting for me.

00:12.697 --> 00:14.059
That's exciting for any actor.

00:14.100 --> 00:16.695
And then, I got a call from my mother while I was in England...

00:16.745 --> 00:19.818
...and she goes, "I did something hilarious!"

00:19.900 --> 00:21.257
And I was like, "What?"

00:21.587 --> 00:23.207
She was like, "I voted!"

00:23.587 --> 00:24.698
And I was like, "You voted for what?"

00:24.875 --> 00:25.813
"The Oscars!"

00:26.517 --> 00:28.577
And I was like, "You voted for the Oscars?"

00:28.661 --> 00:29.092
"What do you mean?"

00:29.177 --> 00:31.441
She was like, "The ballot came here, and I voted."

00:33.279 --> 00:35.469
Because she thought I'd be like,  "Ah! Ha ha ha."

00:35.705 --> 00:38.285
"That's hilarious, I'm gonna get kicked out of the Academy."

00:39.003 --> 00:42.615
Fortunately, she did it wrong and I think she mailed it back to herself.

00:43.101 --> 00:44.591
So, I got to do it again.

00:45.013 --> 00:45.705
That's horrible.

00:45.801 --> 00:48.347
So, she just thought anybody who receives the ballot can vote?

00:48.791 --> 00:50.728
Like it's the people's choice award or something.

00:50.847 --> 00:51.429
Exactly.

00:51.809 --> 00:52.773
I'm one of the people.

00:52.842 --> 00:54.341
You have to be in the Academy.

00:54.547 --> 00:56.778
Wow, so did you see who she voted?

00:57.025 --> 00:58.633
Did you agree with whom she voted for?

00:58.847 --> 00:59.164
No.

00:59.397 --> 00:59.726
Okay.

01:00.366 --> 01:01.011
No, I didn't.
