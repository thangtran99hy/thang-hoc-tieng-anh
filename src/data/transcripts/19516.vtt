Fear of speaking is a common thing that everyone goes through.

00:12.193 --> 00:15.961
And so I decided that Toastmasters, give it a shot,...

00:16.127 --> 00:17.717
...and teach myself to speak in public.

00:18.002 --> 00:20.247
My club, they said, "Why don't you go in competitions?"

00:20.482 --> 00:24.148
I don't even know there were such a thing as competitions for public speaking,...

00:24.319 --> 00:26.225
...but then the bug sort of bit...

00:26.552 --> 00:28.247
...and I really liked the sport of competing.

00:29.360 --> 00:32.908
It's 30,000 people all over the world who all have a message, who all have a speech.

00:33.206 --> 00:35.995
It goes from the club, then the area, then the division,...

00:36.081 --> 00:37.680
...then the district, then the semifinals,...

00:37.745 --> 00:40.229
...and now it's the top nine speakers.

00:40.303 --> 00:41.225
Best speakers in the world.

00:45.116 --> 00:50.914
Before I even do a speech, I have to really have a reason for giving that speech.

00:51.022 --> 00:53.433
I don't just randomly throw speeches together.

00:53.871 --> 00:57.729
Anybody can do a speech, but I think the passion that you have behind it...

00:57.805 --> 01:01.516
...and connecting with your audience makes a great speech.

01:01.948 --> 01:04.388
Trust is a Must, Ryan Avery.

01:06.298 --> 01:07.805
Oh, he's so handsome.

01:08.097 --> 01:11.051
You have an obligation as a speaker to go up there...

01:11.195 --> 01:13.183
...and not just send something that you care about,...

01:13.253 --> 01:15.811
...but something that can really change the lives of people.
