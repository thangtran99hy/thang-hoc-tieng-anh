00:00.233 --> 00:01.733
It's hauntingly beautiful.

00:01.853 --> 00:05.091
Unborn Nevaeh Atkins reaches out of her mother's womb...

00:05.446 --> 00:09.362
...and holds the finger of the doctor performing her C-section delivery.

00:09.642 --> 00:12.198
He showed it to me and I was just like, "Oh my God, this is amazing."

00:13.149 --> 00:16.185
Few lives will be as well documented as little Nevaeh's.

00:16.289 --> 00:21.865
Her mother is a professional photographer, however, it was her dad Randy who snapped the pic.

00:22.016 --> 00:25.256
Doctor called me over and said, "Hey, she's grabbing my finger."

00:25.417 --> 00:27.278
So I just ran over there and just grabbed the shot...

00:27.863 --> 00:32.119
...and I was just in awe looking at it, it was such an amazing picture.

00:32.310 --> 00:33.667
I heard you were nervous that you were gonna miss it.

00:34.103 --> 00:34.619
Very nervous.

00:35.097 --> 00:37.941
Alicia gave her doctor a canvas print of the photo.

00:38.165 --> 00:40.482
The doctor knew it was an amazing photo right away.

00:41.816 --> 00:43.897
The next day, that's all he could talk about for weeks.

00:44.121 --> 00:48.501
And after a thousand likes on Facebook, she's even gotten a few offers to buy the picture.

00:48.745 --> 00:55.072
A couple of them has said that they would love to have the photo for their organization...

00:55.145 --> 00:57.069
...for when they're against abortion.
