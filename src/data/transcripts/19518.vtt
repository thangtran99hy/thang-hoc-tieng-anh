00:05.359 --> 00:06.403
They didn't say anything,...

00:07.018 --> 00:07.978
...but I knew it was hard.

00:10.286 --> 00:12.044
They felt like they had to be brave for me,...

00:12.654 --> 00:14.086
...said I had enough to worry about.

00:16.112 --> 00:16.965
Shaun stepped up.

00:17.572 --> 00:20.065
You wouldn't get a complaint out of that boy for a hundred dollars.

00:21.013 --> 00:22.059
I know he missed me.

00:24.505 --> 00:26.771
Sometimes when we ride to school, we can't stop talking,...

00:27.401 --> 00:28.466
...asking me questions.

00:29.683 --> 00:31.767
Other times, it's quiet.

00:33.149 --> 00:34.903
It's just the two of us, and we ride.

00:36.747 --> 00:37.679
I know what it means.

00:38.033 --> 00:38.971
It means that he needs me.

00:39.779 --> 00:40.590
And I'm here for him.

00:44.240 --> 00:45.840
He had to wait for his father.

00:46.555 --> 00:47.225
And now that I'm here,...

00:48.342 --> 00:49.611
...he's going to learn everything I know.
