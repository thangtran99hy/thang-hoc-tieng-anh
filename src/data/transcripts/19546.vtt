Hi, this is Josh Lowensohn with CNET.com...

00:07.670 --> 00:10.933
...here at Samsung's post keynote demo of Youm.

00:11.347 --> 00:15.605
This is a flexible display technology that's going to be in tablets, smartphones...

00:15.683 --> 00:18.706
...and all sorts of new devices that Samsung hopes the companies are gonna make.

00:19.249 --> 00:20.783
So let me show you what's cool about this.

00:21.199 --> 00:22.981
The display can actually wrap around.

00:23.132 --> 00:26.958
So on these two reference designs for basically concepts,...

00:27.309 --> 00:30.339
...you get a display that wraps around the side.

00:30.644 --> 00:34.258
Here it's on the bottom, and over here it's actually on the side of the device.

00:34.652 --> 00:38.344
And what this lets you do is see a display or a notification or some sort of message...

00:38.705 --> 00:40.951
...without actually having to open up the device or see it.

00:41.816 --> 00:44.077
Samsung's example is that you can have it on a table...

00:44.283 --> 00:46.084
...and flat and still see that kind of stuff.

00:46.831 --> 00:48.805
So they kind of envision some products...

00:48.889 --> 00:51.541
...that wrap around like binders or bifold wallets...

00:52.113 --> 00:53.941
...and still have all your displays going.

00:54.689 --> 00:56.686
So there's no price or release date on this yet,...

00:57.109 --> 01:00.752
...but Samsung says it intends to ship into its partners in the future.

01:01.457 --> 01:05.020
So again, this is a first look at Youm, Samsung's new flexible technology.

01:05.454 --> 01:07.281
