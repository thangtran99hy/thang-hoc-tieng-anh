February is home to one of the most important holidays of the year not to forget.

00:03.939 --> 00:04.589
Groundhog Day.

00:05.079 --> 00:08.186
If you live outside of Can-merica, then you might not know what a groundhog is, so...

00:08.322 --> 00:08.777
...here you go.

00:09.107 --> 00:10.202
This is a groundhog.

00:10.561 --> 00:13.331
They're basically giant grumpy squirrels who dig burrows underground.

00:13.620 --> 00:16.049
Burrows large enough in fact to occasionally make their comfy home...

00:16.141 --> 00:17.847
...a structural hazard to your comfy home.

00:18.150 --> 00:19.532
This explains the first half of their name.

00:19.679 --> 00:21.297
The second half is because they're kind of fat.

00:21.532 --> 00:23.083
Though unlike their fellow Can-mericans,...

00:23.152 --> 00:26.062
...when winter arrives they need their excess weight to go into hibernation.

00:26.305 --> 00:28.211
The story of the holiday is that on February 2nd...

00:28.278 --> 00:31.799
...the wise groundhogs wake from hibernation to peek out of their burrow and look at the world.

00:31.951 --> 00:35.137
If they see their shadow, they go back inside, which predicts six more weeks of winter.

00:35.261 --> 00:36.799
If they don't, then spring will come early.

00:37.091 --> 00:40.621
The holiday started in the 1800s as a Pennsylvania Dutch custom of weather prediction,...

00:40.681 --> 00:43.551
...and today is celebrated in Canada and 49 of the 50 states.

00:43.728 --> 00:45.880
The exception being Alaska, which in 2009...

00:45.896 --> 00:48.531
...decided to forego Groundhog Day in favor of Marmot Day.
