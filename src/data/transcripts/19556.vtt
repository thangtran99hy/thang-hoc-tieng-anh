00:02.066 --> 00:04.409
The world is full of amazing rivers and lakes,...

00:04.609 --> 00:06.571
...but one in particular really stands out.

00:07.139 --> 00:11.255
Cano Cristales, commonly referred to as "the river that ran away to paradise,"...

00:11.405 --> 00:13.472
...is a famous body of water in Colombia.

00:13.855 --> 00:15.671
The river has a clear and calm current,...

00:15.910 --> 00:18.621
...allowing visitors to see life underneath the water's surface.

00:18.959 --> 00:22.229
Residing underwater is a range of rocks covered in green moss.

00:22.872 --> 00:25.330
But for a period of time from September to November,...

00:25.499 --> 00:27.949
...the water level dips, allowing the sun's natural heat...

00:28.047 --> 00:31.169
...to warm that moss covering the rocks and other algae formations...

00:31.319 --> 00:32.274
...beneath the surface.

00:32.714 --> 00:35.687
The effect of the warmth results in a stunning transformation:...

00:36.063 --> 00:39.261
...blooms grow beneath the water, ranging in all shades of colors.

00:39.752 --> 00:42.098
A plant on the river floor turns vibrant red,...

00:42.318 --> 00:44.879
...while the moss turns from slightly dull to bright green.

00:45.533 --> 00:48.753
Algae plants that cover rocks turn shades of purple and magenta.

00:49.060 --> 00:52.390
The water is so clear, it casts a sparkling blue appearance.

00:53.061 --> 00:55.519
The river spans roughly 100 kilometers long.

00:55.797 --> 00:57.939
The natural specimen is not easily accessible,...

00:58.114 --> 01:00.827
...as visitors must venture through La Macarena and hike...

01:01.033 --> 01:03.257
...or ride horses through unmarked trails.
