Chocolate.

00:02.724 --> 00:04.781
Chocolate is a favorite at Valentine's Day.

00:04.931 --> 00:06.400
It's rumored to be an aphrodisiac.

00:06.495 --> 00:09.913
That goes all the way back to the ancient Incas and the Mayas and Montezuma.

00:10.089 --> 00:12.113
Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, white chocolate,...

00:12.262 --> 00:13.595
...making it rain with chocolate.

00:13.806 --> 00:14.818
We're gonna chop up the chocolate.

00:14.903 --> 00:16.087
You can use your serrated knife.

00:16.451 --> 00:18.311
You can use this crazy thing...

00:18.723 --> 00:20.503
...and just rock it back and forth like that,...

00:20.613 --> 00:24.307
...and really break up the chocolate into small pieces so you can melt it quickly and easily.

00:24.417 --> 00:25.535
So, we're gonna beat up our egg whites.

00:25.619 --> 00:27.323
We want them to get them till they're nice and frothy...

00:27.522 --> 00:28.276
...and you gotta beat 'em.
