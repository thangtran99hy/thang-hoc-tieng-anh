Any questions?

00:09.819 --> 00:10.853
Not bad, not bad.

It's going to be like that, huh?

Someone wants to play.

00:16.625 --> 00:18.000
Just trying to keep up with the old guy, you know?

00:18.190 --> 00:19.097
Dude, is that your real hair?

00:23.784 --> 00:24.412
Is that all you got?

00:29.633 --> 00:30.665
I just can't miss today.

00:31.141 --> 00:32.033
Did you ever get days like that?

00:35.683 --> 00:37.120

00:37.400 --> 00:37.756
Are you looking?

00:42.831 --> 00:43.410

00:55.021 --> 00:55.564
How did you do that?

00:56.095 --> 00:56.565
You'll learn.
