00:02.647 --> 00:05.371
Residing in Japan is the Jigokudani Monkey Park.

00:05.733 --> 00:08.758
The area is very cold, resulting in frozen grounds.

00:09.272 --> 00:12.133
However, a unique aspect of the park is the boiling water,...

00:12.277 --> 00:14.699
...which bubbles up from cracks in the ground's surface.

00:15.287 --> 00:19.813
The park is referred to as "Hell's Valley" due to the hot springs and surrounding steep cliffs.

00:20.032 --> 00:23.359
It has an elevation of nearly 2,790 feet,...

00:23.466 --> 00:26.327
...and snow covers the ground for roughly four months of the year.

00:27.005 --> 00:30.334
The harsh environment keeps it generally uncrowded when it comes to humans.

00:30.452 --> 00:32.572
However, monkeys find the park to be a haven.

00:33.109 --> 00:36.665
Japanese macaques, also known as snow monkeys, inhabit the park...

00:36.788 --> 00:39.683
...commonly gathering around a man-made pool near the entrance.

00:40.327 --> 00:43.164
The monkeys usually stick together, staying in large groups...

00:43.293 --> 00:45.477
...and they have become accustomed to human guests.

00:45.907 --> 00:49.295
The monkeys mostly ignore people, but allow them to get close-up views.

00:49.704 --> 00:54.088
The large population of Japanese macaques descends from the cliffs to reside in the park...

00:54.216 --> 00:57.829
...during the days of the winter months in order to bathe in the hot springs.

00:58.409 --> 01:01.681
During the evening hours, they return to the safety of the nearby forests.

01:02.298 --> 01:06.066
These red-faced, long-haired monkeys calmly relax or play in the pools,...

01:06.197 --> 01:07.963
...which seem to serve as jacuzzis to them.
