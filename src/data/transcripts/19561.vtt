China is full of architectural gems.

00:06.607 --> 00:10.605
A prime example is "The Hanging Temple" located in Shanxi province.

00:10.795 --> 00:14.045
As the name implies, it simply appears to be hanging in midair,...

00:14.246 --> 00:16.879
...set up high amidst the gorgeous backdrop of a mountain.

00:18.187 --> 00:20.905
In reality, the temple is supported from wooden pillars,...

00:21.090 --> 00:23.817
...which are placed into holes that were cut into the side of the cliff.

00:24.465 --> 00:27.185
The structure was constructed more than 1,000 years ago...

00:27.356 --> 00:30.291
...and it stands nearly 250 feet above the ground.

00:30.641 --> 00:33.602
The temple itself is more than 160 feet tall.

00:34.416 --> 00:38.239
The temple faces a gorgeous valley and serves as a unique tourist attraction.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.330
Visitors can walk upwards with the help of a stone walkway.

00:42.187 --> 00:45.631
The temple houses more than 40 cabinets, corridors and pavilions,...

00:45.853 --> 00:48.483
...which all connect by both boardwalks and bridges.

00:49.096 --> 00:53.084
The interior of the temple contains clay sculptures and stone carvings.

00:53.374 --> 00:55.639
The unique layout and location attract visitors,...

00:55.759 --> 00:58.779
...but lovers of architecture can appreciate the varying design elements.

00:59.651 --> 01:03.277
The temple showcases Taoist, Buddhist and Confucian characteristics.
