WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:05.350
You might not remember us but we met in the 90s.

00:07.142 --> 00:13.027
We are members of Generation Y, as in yin yang, yo-yo.

00:15.677 --> 00:17.551
Life moved a little slower.

00:18.792 --> 00:19.755
Disks were square.

00:20.417 --> 00:22.210
Desktop folders had personality.

00:23.279 --> 00:25.643
Extra storage space was just a zipper away.

00:26.832 --> 00:28.308
There is only one social network,...

00:28.917 --> 00:31.339
...but most of your friends died of dysentery.

00:32.157 --> 00:34.102
The only thing buzzing in your pocket was a pet.

00:35.377 --> 00:36.530
Until that died too.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.679
But at least the troll was still a friend.

00:42.270 --> 00:44.815
Lunch was a puzzle, not a picture.

00:45.885 --> 00:48.954
You were pumping jams, water, shoes.

00:50.815 --> 00:53.545
You didn't have to worry about a news feed full of farm animals.

00:55.805 --> 00:58.172
You were busy feeding wild animals.

00:59.355 --> 01:01.479
A haircut didn't cost 60 dollars.

01:02.833 --> 01:04.167
It cost four minutes.

01:05.983 --> 01:07.978
You really had nothing to lose.

01:11.188 --> 01:16.133
Unless, of course, you were playing for keeps.

01:18.541 --> 01:19.623
The future was bright.

01:22.664 --> 01:27.189
You grew up and so did we.
