I'm a designer and an educator.

00:18.671 --> 00:20.249
I'm a multitasking person...

00:20.383 --> 00:27.214
...and I push my students to fly through a very creative, multitasking design process.

00:27.806 --> 00:31.851
But how efficient is, really, this multitasking?

00:32.709 --> 00:37.349
Let's consider for a while the option of monotasking.

00:38.836 --> 00:39.897
A couple of examples.

00:41.225 --> 00:41.881
Look at that.

00:42.569 --> 00:45.116
This is my multitasking activity result.

00:46.277 --> 00:49.903
So trying to cook, answering the phone, writing SMS...

00:50.011 --> 00:53.965
...and maybe uploading some pictures about this awesome barbecue.

00:56.183 --> 00:59.347
So someone tells us the story about supertaskers,...

01:00.563 --> 01:06.345
...this two percent of people who are able to control a multitasking environment.

01:07.643 --> 01:11.543
But what about ourselves and what about our reality?

01:12.126 --> 01:16.537
When was the last time you really enjoyed just the voice of your friend?

01:17.600 --> 01:25.285
So this is a project I'm working on, and this is a series of front covers...

01:26.116 --> 01:30.840
...to downgrade our super, hyper....

01:35.362 --> 01:40.394
...to downgrade our super, hyper mobile phones into the essence of their function.

01:41.159 --> 01:42.121
Another example.

01:42.631 --> 01:43.871
Have you ever been to Venice?

01:44.197 --> 01:49.442
How beautiful it is to lose ourselves in these little streets on the island.

01:50.963 --> 01:56.445
But our multitasking reality is pretty different and full of tons of information.

01:58.432 --> 02:03.738
So what about something like that to rediscover our sense of adventure?

02:05.056 --> 02:12.497
I know that it sounds pretty weird to speak about mono when the number of possibilities is so huge.

02:13.903 --> 02:20.061
But I push you to consider the option of focusing on just one task...

02:20.703 --> 02:24.241
...or maybe turning your digital senses totally off.

02:26.533 --> 02:31.994
So nowadays, everyone could produce his mono product.

02:32.620 --> 02:33.159
Why not?

02:33.806 --> 02:38.264
So find your monotask spot within the multitasking world.

02:39.135 --> 02:39.647
Thank you.
