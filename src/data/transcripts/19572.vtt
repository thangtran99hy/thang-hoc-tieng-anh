This is the first IKEA catalog.

00:07.205 --> 00:11.542
It was born in the woods of Sweden, a long time ago.

00:13.099 --> 00:17.060
Back then, we were a small company with a big idea:...

00:18.073 --> 00:21.081
...to create a better everyday life for the many people.

00:21.650 --> 00:24.327
The idea spread and our little company grew.

00:24.733 --> 00:25.802
So did our catalog.

00:26.466 --> 00:31.989
Every year, it inspires more and more people around the world to create homes they love.

00:32.616 --> 00:35.957
Now, we're taking the inspiration one step further.

00:36.514 --> 00:39.254
This year, the IKEA catalog is alive;...

00:40.100 --> 00:46.577
...alive with smart ideas, fun stories, and beautiful products.

00:47.617 --> 00:52.101
Every page marked with this symbol is a door to a world of additional content.

00:53.508 --> 00:56.640
Download the IKEA Catalogue App for your smartphone or tablet...

00:57.563 --> 01:05.377
...and scan to unlock films, interactive experiences, photo galleries...

01:06.301 --> 01:08.674
...and more home furnishing inspiration.

01:09.606 --> 01:13.081
With this year's IKEA catalog, there are endless possibilities...

01:13.534 --> 01:16.768
...to make your life at home just a little bit better.
