Key Technical Matters: How to Leave a Meeting.

00:04.492 --> 00:06.001
No matter how contentious the meeting,...

00:06.209 --> 00:09.281
...always shake hands with your counterparts while looking them in the eye...

00:09.364 --> 00:10.834
...and saying something positive.

00:11.497 --> 00:12.255
No hugs.

00:12.502 --> 00:13.531
No high fives.

00:13.776 --> 00:14.729
No butt slaps.

00:15.543 --> 00:16.587
If you're hosting the meeting,...

00:16.977 --> 00:20.160
...see your guests out as far as the door or elevator.

00:20.965 --> 00:23.630
Talk about anything except what you just met about.

00:24.365 --> 00:26.735
After a great meeting, don't say, "Great meeting!"

00:27.141 --> 00:29.663
After a bad meeting, don't say, "Bad meeting!"

00:30.453 --> 00:33.664
After a ho-hum meeting, don't say, "Ho-hum meeting."

00:34.287 --> 00:38.745
In fact, never under any circumstances say "ho-hum" ever.

00:39.824 --> 00:42.188
Do not say, "Hey, let's be careful out there,"...

00:42.647 --> 00:45.954
...unless you just wrapped up a meeting with your fellow police officers.

00:47.245 --> 00:50.286
Do not hand out gold stars to those who did a good job.

00:50.720 --> 00:51.779
Even metaphorically.

00:52.500 --> 00:55.979
The best attitude to have while leaving a meeting room is hopeful.

00:56.309 --> 00:59.189
The second best attitude to have is kind of hopeful.

00:59.981 --> 01:02.041
Do not tout the quality of your doodling...

01:02.552 --> 01:07.017
...unless it's of remarkably high quality with fine lines and a certain panache.

01:09.783 --> 01:11.865
Leave the last doughnut.

01:12.903 --> 01:16.885
You can go back in a few minutes and grab it after everyone's walked away,...

01:17.177 --> 01:20.049
...but for now, just walk away from the doughnut.
