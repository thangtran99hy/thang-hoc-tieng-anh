Key Technical Matters: How to Pitch.

00:07.195 --> 00:11.405
The fact that you're amped is not something that needs to be pointed out to the "pitchee."

00:12.035 --> 00:14.569
Related: Never use the word "pitchee."

00:15.766 --> 00:18.788
In business, a pitch should not involve a pitching motion.

00:19.428 --> 00:21.709
It should also not involve a batting motion.

00:22.821 --> 00:28.019
At no point should you say, "Now bear with me here or please."

00:28.804 --> 00:33.240
At no point should you ask if anyone is "picking up" what you're "putting down" ...

00:33.724 --> 00:37.666
...unless someone is literally picking up objects that you're placing on a surface.

00:38.883 --> 00:41.047
If your pitch is veering in the "spiel" territory,...

00:41.181 --> 00:43.700
...remind yourself that you're not a carnival barker.

00:44.753 --> 00:47.279
If your pitch is veering in the "claptrap" territory,...

00:47.574 --> 00:51.341
...remind yourself that you're not in a screwball comedy from the 1930s.

00:52.322 --> 00:54.777
If your pitch is veering in the "jibber jabber" territory,...

00:55.050 --> 00:57.842
...wrap the pitch while backing out of the room quietly...

00:58.255 --> 01:01.949
...because this partnership will probably not be flowering.

01:03.722 --> 01:04.947
Leave your card anyway.
