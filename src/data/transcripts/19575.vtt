00:11.640 --> 00:17.089

00:18.011 --> 00:21.120
Connotations of a great business gift, in descending order:

00:21.473 --> 00:21.856
Thank you.

00:22.369 --> 00:23.417
It's great being your partner.

00:24.133 --> 00:24.904
Please.

00:25.646 --> 00:26.699
I'm begging you here.

00:27.456 --> 00:30.287
I spent hours whittling your likeness into a piece of oak.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.257
No gift cards.

00:32.998 --> 00:36.841
No coupons for "Free hugs to be redeemed at any time."

00:38.057 --> 00:40.930
Anything with your company's logo on it is not a gift.

00:41.614 --> 00:43.312
A promotional watch is not a gift.

00:43.525 --> 00:45.443
A promotional shirt is not a gift.

00:45.783 --> 00:47.603
A promotional pen is not a gift.

00:47.969 --> 00:53.395
A promotional stress relief hand globe is absolutely not a gift.

00:53.746 --> 00:56.287
It's also not an effective weapon against stress.

01:00.003 --> 01:03.578
At the end of the day, an employee only really wants one kind of gift:...

01:04.117 --> 01:04.943
...a day off.

01:05.756 --> 01:07.734
Investors only want one kind of gift, too:...

01:08.399 --> 01:09.019
...a return...

01:09.999 --> 01:11.914
...and maybe an interesting bottle of whiskey.

01:12.471 --> 01:15.776
Oh, what the hell, maybe throw in a couple of those shirts for the kids,...

01:16.869 --> 01:18.298
...but mostly, a return.
