Hi, I'm Kevin Allocca.

00:17.246 --> 00:20.885
I'm the trends manager at YouTube, and I professionally watch YouTube videos.

00:21.492 --> 00:22.121
It's true.

00:23.451 --> 00:25.921
So, we're gonna talk a little bit today about how videos go viral...

00:25.985 --> 00:27.382
...and then why that even matters.

00:28.437 --> 00:32.301
We all wanna be stars: celebrities, singers, comedians...

00:32.893 --> 00:35.904
...and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do.

00:36.449 --> 00:39.821
But now, Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things...

00:39.940 --> 00:43.211
...that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world's culture.

00:44.297 --> 00:47.205
Anyone of you could be famous on the Internet by next Saturday.

00:47.620 --> 00:51.273
But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute.

00:52.160 --> 00:54.965
And of that, only a tiny percentage ever goes viral...

00:55.032 --> 00:57.175
...and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment.

00:57.270 --> 00:58.624
So, how does it happen?

00:59.663 --> 01:04.934
Three things: tastemakers, communities of participation and unexpectedness.

01:05.316 --> 01:05.798
All right, let's go.

01:20.567 --> 01:25.673
Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this video that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park.

01:26.089 --> 01:28.913
In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times.

01:30.687 --> 01:34.357
This is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer.

01:35.638 --> 01:38.318
But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video, Bear.

01:38.711 --> 01:40.218
He just wanted to share a rainbow.

01:40.663 --> 01:42.913
Because that's what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear.

01:45.455 --> 01:48.065
And he had posted lots of nature videos, in fact.

01:48.184 --> 01:51.312
And this video had actually been posted all the way back in January.

01:52.379 --> 01:53.729
So, what happened here?

01:55.063 --> 01:56.103
Jimmy Kimmel actually.

01:57.250 --> 02:00.675
Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video...

02:00.739 --> 02:02.006
...to be as popular as it would become.

02:02.477 --> 02:06.689
Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things...

02:06.771 --> 02:07.999
...and bring them to a larger audience.

02:21.719 --> 02:24.568
So, you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation...

02:24.639 --> 02:26.147
...without talking about this video, I hope.

02:27.268 --> 02:29.991
Rebecca Black's "Friday" is one of the most popular videos of the year.

02:30.223 --> 02:32.777
It's been seen nearly 200 million times this year.

02:34.025 --> 02:35.323
This is a chart of what it looked like.

02:35.428 --> 02:39.377
And similar to "Double Rainbow," it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere.

02:40.821 --> 02:42.487
So, what happened on this day?

02:43.253 --> 02:45.140
Well it was a Friday, this is true.

02:45.926 --> 02:48.739
And if you're wondering about those other spikes, those are also Fridays.

02:54.147 --> 02:56.637
But what about this day, this one particular Friday?

02:57.841 --> 03:00.951
Well Tosh.0 picked it up, a lot of blogs starting writing about it.

03:01.081 --> 03:04.051
Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater was one of the first people...

03:04.125 --> 03:06.098
...to post a joke about the video on Twitter.

03:06.494 --> 03:10.475
But what's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view...

03:10.876 --> 03:13.796
...and they shared that with a larger audience, accelerating the process.

03:14.196 --> 03:17.723
And so then, this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke...

03:17.823 --> 03:20.531
...and they started talking about it and doing things with it.

03:20.989 --> 03:24.256
And now, there are 10,000 parodies of "Friday" on YouTube.

03:24.981 --> 03:28.577
Even in the first seven days, there was one parody for every other day of the week.

03:33.709 --> 03:36.054
Unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century,...

03:36.257 --> 03:40.240
...this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon...

03:40.325 --> 03:42.677
...either by spreading it or doing something new with it.
