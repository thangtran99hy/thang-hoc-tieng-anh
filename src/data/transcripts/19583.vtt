You're looking at the new thing in toys.

00:05.153 --> 00:09.814
Not really the tanks themselves, but how they're being controlled by smartphones.

00:10.040 --> 00:10.742
Right now here,...

00:11.012 --> 00:17.403
...the global market trend is to integrate technology and electronics with toys...

00:17.552 --> 00:22.096
...in order to explore more playing possibilities.

00:22.347 --> 00:26.389
And at this fair in Hong Kong, it's the smarter toys that are drawing the attention.

00:26.927 --> 00:29.920
That includes this toy gun that has an iPhone attached to it.

00:29.979 --> 00:32.050
We see the potential of augmented reality...

00:32.391 --> 00:37.560
...and we thought this technology will enhance the toy's playing level...

00:37.848 --> 00:42.761
...or enhance the game of the toy.

00:42.936 --> 00:44.684
Traditionalist, be not afraid.

00:45.059 --> 00:47.142
Despite all of these high-tech gadgets,...

00:47.223 --> 00:49.818
...the fair was still dominated by stuffed animals,...

00:49.983 --> 00:52.189
...regular remote-controlled cars and helicopters,...

00:52.561 --> 00:55.511
...and of course, the little plush toys for babies.
