What's happened is in the last decade or so,...

00:09.625 --> 00:12.174
...we've just been able to collect lots and lots of data in places...

00:12.229 --> 00:13.519
...we've never been able to collect before.

00:14.009 --> 00:15.701
Now the question is what do we do with all these data?

00:18.757 --> 00:20.489
Basketball is kind of a dance.

00:20.611 --> 00:22.852
There's always sort of moves and countermoves.

00:23.425 --> 00:24.585
Pick and rolls and screens.

00:25.482 --> 00:29.138
The statistics that we have right now are the best we can do as a function of the box score.
