Good news for coffee lovers and environmentalists alike.

00:03.582 --> 00:06.750
Starbucks is making another move to help the world look a little greener.

00:07.159 --> 00:08.112
Here's WJBK.

00:08.279 --> 00:10.592
The coffee chain is continuing its push to go green.

00:10.930 --> 00:16.201
Starting today, the coffee giant will offer customers a reusable plastic cup for one dollar.

00:16.617 --> 00:17.673
The goal of these new cups?

00:17.775 --> 00:21.027
To make sure fewer grande and venti cups wind up in landfills.

00:21.372 --> 00:25.753
The reusable tumblers will mimic Starbucks paper cups, showcasing its traditional logo.

00:26.175 --> 00:27.427
As with any reusable cup,...

00:27.599 --> 00:32.387
...Starbucks customers will continue getting ten cents off each time they bring it in for a refill.

00:32.790 --> 00:34.247
And you can even have them cleaned.

00:34.863 --> 00:37.415
Going green has been a longtime focus for Starbucks,...

00:37.555 --> 00:41.495
...but Fox business says the company appears to have set its goals a little too high.

00:41.773 --> 00:44.472
They're hoping that will increase the habit for other people and...

00:44.813 --> 00:45.612
...go green, the whole thing.

00:45.692 --> 00:52.468
In 2008, Starbucks had said it wanted to serve 25 percent of all drinks in reusable cups by 2015.

00:52.965 --> 00:54.847
The goal now has been reduced to five percent.

00:55.029 --> 00:59.411
In reality, Starbucks served 1.9 percent of its drinks in personal tumblers...

00:59.546 --> 01:02.609
...in its global company-owned stores in 2011.
