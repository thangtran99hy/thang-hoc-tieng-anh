Adele will perform 'Skyfall' live for the first time at the 85th Academy Awards.

00:05.225 --> 00:08.413
The British singer co-wrote the hit song with Paul Epworth...

00:08.623 --> 00:12.417
...and saw it become the first Bond tune to debut in the Billboard Top 10...

00:12.789 --> 00:18.079
...and the first nominated for Best Song since Sheena Easton's 'For Your Eyes Only' in 1981.

00:18.425 --> 00:23.637
The performance will likely be a ratings boon for the broadcast in the coveted younger demographic...

00:23.894 --> 00:27.200
...that led to the selection of Family Guy's Seth MacFarlane as host.

00:27.431 --> 00:32.359
The film 'Skyfall' will vie for five Oscars in all when the show airs February 24th.

00:32.810 --> 00:37.572
Adele said it would be terrifyingly wonderful to perform on Hollywood's biggest night,...

00:37.747 --> 00:41.685
...hopefully not so scary that her performance ends in rumors of lip-synching,...

00:42.025 --> 00:44.223
...as one did for a fellow diva this week.
