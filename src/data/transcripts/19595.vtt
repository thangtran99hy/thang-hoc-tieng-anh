Hi everyone, I'm Mimi.

00:04.340 --> 00:06.076
Hi everyone, I'm Myung-myung.

00:06.452 --> 00:07.193
Hi, Myung-myung.

00:07.391 --> 00:08.607
Can I ask you a question?

00:09.143 --> 00:10.813
What's your zodiac sign?

00:11.627 --> 00:13.147
Yeah, I know, I'm the Dragon.

00:13.957 --> 00:15.651
Do you know why you are a Dragon?

00:16.703 --> 00:17.518
No, I don't know.

00:18.093 --> 00:21.811
As a Chinese you should know about the history of zodiacs.

00:22.335 --> 00:24.786
Let me tell you a story about it now.

00:25.403 --> 00:26.669
Okay, sure, why not?

00:27.394 --> 00:32.620
Once upon a time, the 12 animals quarreled about the order of the cycle...

00:33.045 --> 00:35.418
...because everyone wanted to take the lead.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.087
No decision was made.

00:37.517 --> 00:40.943
Finally, the animals agreed to ask the Jade Emperor,...

00:41.293 --> 00:46.069
...the ruler of the gods in Chinese mythology, to decide the order.

00:46.885 --> 00:48.434
Let's hold a competition.

00:48.578 --> 00:51.164
The animals will run across a river...

00:51.479 --> 00:56.794
...and each animal's position in the circle will be set by its place in the race.

00:57.716 --> 01:01.459
At that time, the cat and the rat were very close friends.

01:01.949 --> 01:05.013
The cat wanted to take up the position in the cycle...

01:05.444 --> 01:06.956
...but he was a sleepyhead.

01:07.345 --> 01:13.731
So the cat told the rat, "Rat, rat, please wake me up tomorrow morning."

01:14.217 --> 01:17.279
The rat said, "Of course, we are good friends."

01:17.459 --> 01:22.013
But the next morning, he did not wake up the cat and went to the race by himself.

01:22.579 --> 01:26.320
All the other animals gathered at the bank of the river in the morning,...

01:26.646 --> 01:27.600
...and the race began.

01:27.750 --> 01:33.641
When the rat was swimming, he found that the ox was swimming faster than anyone else.

01:34.155 --> 01:38.557
Then the rat jumped onto the ox's back without being noticed.

01:39.145 --> 01:42.482
Just as the ox was about to reach the destination,...

01:42.963 --> 01:46.667
...the rat jumped out of his back and won the race.

01:47.127 --> 01:49.879
The rat became the lead sign of the cycle.

01:50.314 --> 01:51.901
The ox falls to the second.

01:52.251 --> 01:55.851
The pig, lazy and slow, became the last.

01:56.363 --> 01:59.409
The cat didn't wake up until the race was over,...

01:59.892 --> 02:04.376
...but it was too late and he was not able to make it in the cycle.

02:05.359 --> 02:07.773
This is the story of our zodiacs.

02:07.965 --> 02:11.385
Now you know about the history of zodiacs, Myung-myung?

02:11.855 --> 02:12.699
Yes, I do.

02:13.155 --> 02:14.664
Thank you so much, Mimi.

02:16.135 --> 02:18.419
That's an interesting folktale, eh?

02:18.884 --> 02:24.930
Actually, I know there are still so many young people in China that don't know about the story...

02:25.033 --> 02:28.401
...and many other Chinese traditional culture as well.

02:29.551 --> 02:30.891
Wow, that's not cool.

02:31.065 --> 02:34.395
We should cherish and protect our traditional culture.

02:34.974 --> 02:38.206
They're a precious treasure for us and our country.
