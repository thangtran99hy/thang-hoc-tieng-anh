00:05.699 --> 00:09.350
I am not abdicating because the position was too hard on me,...

00:10.158 --> 00:13.719
...but because of my belief that the responsibility of this country...

00:13.870 --> 00:16.423
...has to be in the hands of a new generation.

00:19.731 --> 00:24.895
With complete trust, I will transfer the throne to my son, the Prince of Orange.

00:25.416 --> 00:30.007
He and Princess Maxima are fully prepared for their future task.

00:33.347 --> 00:37.197
Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands has abdicated in favor of her son,...

00:37.351 --> 00:40.149
...Prince Willem-Alexander, age 45.

00:41.025 --> 00:45.176
The Dutch Prime Minister made a statement shortly after the queen's announcement.

00:51.824 --> 00:55.304
On this special moment for the queen and for the Netherlands,...

00:55.448 --> 00:59.723
...I want to give my respect and admiration for her outstanding services...

00:59.853 --> 01:01.773
...both in and for our country.

01:03.945 --> 01:08.478
From the moment she was crowned in 1980, she has given her heart and soul.

01:12.349 --> 01:15.945
Beatrix assumed the throne after her mother, Queen Juliana,...

01:16.235 --> 01:19.477
...stepped aside in her favor 33 years ago.
