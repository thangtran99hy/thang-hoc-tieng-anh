Mardi Gras is the greatest free show on Earth.

00:02.783 --> 00:03.952
But if you've never done it before,...

00:04.019 --> 00:06.200
...there might be some things you'll wanna know before heading out.

00:06.291 --> 00:08.674
So we've all come together, the people who have lived here forever,...

00:08.737 --> 00:10.653
...to tell you how we do Mardi Gras.

00:15.764 --> 00:17.576
Definitely wear comfortable shoes.

00:17.848 --> 00:21.966
The best advice I can give is, is you make sure you find a bathroom.

00:27.599 --> 00:30.212
I would definitely tell 'em it's a marathon, not a sprint.

00:30.307 --> 00:32.908
We used to do alcohol, water, alcohol, water.

00:32.995 --> 00:34.881
Pace yourself; it's a long ride.

00:35.381 --> 00:38.122
Bring something to put your beads in.

00:44.450 --> 00:47.503
And last piece of advice, wear clothes you don't mind getting dirty...

00:47.567 --> 00:49.331
...and get ready to have a great time.

00:49.501 --> 00:52.081
I'm Fleurty Girl and that wraps up another edition of GoNOLA TV...

00:52.156 --> 00:53.599
...and we'll see you next time, darling.
