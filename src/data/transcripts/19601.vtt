00:00.199 --> 00:02.175
Carl, what did you bring for show-and-tell?

00:02.540 --> 00:03.063
One second.

00:05.641 --> 00:06.061
Dad!

00:06.784 --> 00:09.851
I brought the Nissan Pathfinder my family took on vacation.

00:10.170 --> 00:16.575
This mud is from the Okefenokee Swamp, deep inside Georgia.

00:17.349 --> 00:19.193
We even towed a local out of the swamp.

00:19.539 --> 00:20.178
He was cool.

00:21.297 --> 00:24.665
These hoof prints are from some mountain goats we met in White Fish, Montana.

00:25.196 --> 00:27.602
I beat their leader in a staring contest.

00:28.566 --> 00:30.416
We then went off the beaten path,...

00:31.051 --> 00:32.345
...complete isolation,...

00:32.689 --> 00:34.112
...living off the land.

00:34.843 --> 00:37.773
This red clay is from an ancient Indian mud ritual.

00:39.106 --> 00:42.247
It granted me access into the fourth world.

00:42.977 --> 00:43.725
No way.

00:43.871 --> 00:44.551
Yes way.

00:47.089 --> 00:47.961
Where's that from?

00:49.081 --> 00:49.505
The mall.

00:50.261 --> 00:51.833
The all-new Nissan Pathfinder.

00:52.005 --> 00:54.163
It's our most innovative Pathfinder ever.

00:54.563 --> 00:56.893
Nissan: Innovation that Excites.
