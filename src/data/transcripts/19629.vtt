You may think of this place as just a small town in the middle of Ohio.

00:13.915 --> 00:16.209
But this is the place that makes the Super Bowl possible.

00:18.661 --> 00:21.842
This is Wilson, and this is where football is born.

00:24.207 --> 00:28.482
When I see the kickoff, especially at the Super Bowl,....

00:28.759 --> 00:33.689
...it's hard to conceive that I actually had a part in it.

00:34.408 --> 00:38.191
I hand-lace every Super Bowl ball and I am going to be making the footballs...

00:38.379 --> 00:40.633
...for Colin Kaepernick and Joe Flacco.

00:41.910 --> 00:44.261
Football is what puts dinner on my family's table.

00:45.506 --> 00:48.676
Born and raised in Ada, Ohio, and this is where footballs were born.

00:49.672 --> 00:51.504
I work at the Wilson's football factory...

00:51.721 --> 00:54.733
...and I'm proud to be part of the family that makes football possible.

00:57.233 --> 00:58.558
You're welcome, Colin Kaepernick.

01:00.067 --> 01:02.443
My hands to your hands, Joe Flacco.

01:03.933 --> 01:06.615
49ers, Ravens, ball's in your hands now.
