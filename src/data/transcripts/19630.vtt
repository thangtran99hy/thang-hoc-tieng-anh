00:08.909 --> 00:10.987
There will be a seat left open,...

00:12.621 --> 00:14.209
...a light left on,...

00:16.616 --> 00:18.259
...a favorite dinner waiting,...

00:21.440 --> 00:22.912
...a warm bed made.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.674
There will be walks to take,...

00:29.475 --> 00:30.685
...swings to push,...

00:32.602 --> 00:33.840
...and baths to give...

00:36.227 --> 00:37.079
...on your block,...

00:39.621 --> 00:40.526
...at the school,...

00:42.995 --> 00:44.110
...in your church...

00:45.637 --> 00:52.333
...because in your home, in our hearts, you've been missed.

00:55.012 --> 00:56.164
You've been needed.

01:00.097 --> 01:01.617
You've been cried for,...

01:03.607 --> 01:04.419
...prayed for.

01:12.856 --> 01:16.275
You've been the reason we push on.

01:19.349 --> 01:21.318
Half the battle is just knowing...

01:22.213 --> 01:24.526
...this is half the battle...

01:27.356 --> 01:32.125
...because when you're home, we're more than a family.

01:35.445 --> 01:46.062
We are a nation that is whole again.
