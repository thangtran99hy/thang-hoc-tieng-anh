00:00.318 --> 00:02.427
Dad, where do babies come from?

00:05.208 --> 00:07.497
Well, there's a planet.

00:07.903 --> 00:10.189
It's called Babylandia.

00:10.612 --> 00:12.324
That's right, it's filled with babies,...

00:13.663 --> 00:14.907
...babies of all kinds.

00:15.437 --> 00:20.147
And when the time is just right, there's a space launch.

00:20.345 --> 00:21.352
All systems go.

00:24.434 --> 00:29.220
They wave goodbye, and then they board these big, shiny rocket ships.

00:29.375 --> 00:29.577
Right?

00:30.589 --> 00:32.625
They shoot off high in the sky,...

00:32.842 --> 00:37.117
...and they fly through space, and then they penetrate the atmosphere.

00:40.523 --> 00:43.597
And then they're released all over the place,...

00:43.911 --> 00:46.559
...yeah, Africa and the Indian Ocean.

00:47.193 --> 00:47.938
They were everywhere.

00:48.334 --> 00:53.707
After an amazing nine-month journey, they find their mommies and daddies.

00:54.003 --> 00:56.512
And that, son, is where babies come from.

00:59.539 --> 01:02.955
But Jake said babies are made when mommies and daddies...

01:04.777 --> 01:10.057
The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round.

01:10.133 --> 01:15.380
The wheels on the bus go round and round all through the town.
