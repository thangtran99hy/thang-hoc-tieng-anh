Ladies and gentlemen, we proudly present...

00:04.744 --> 00:08.344
...the BlackBerry Z10 and the BlackBerry Q10.

00:10.469 --> 00:14.262
Two brand new devices, and perhaps a fresh start for a company...

00:14.491 --> 00:18.519
...that has seen its global market share plummet from 20 percent three years ago...

00:18.742 --> 00:20.497
...to just over three percent today.

00:20.935 --> 00:26.204
For BlackBerry CEO Thorsten Heins, it's another chance to remake a faded brand.

00:26.421 --> 00:29.612
We have definitely been on a journey of transformation,...

00:30.832 --> 00:34.340
...a journey to not only transform our business and our brand,...

00:35.203 --> 00:42.706
...but one which I truly believe will transform mobile communications into true mobile computing.

00:43.366 --> 00:48.040
The company promises the same high level of network security the BlackBerry is known for,...

00:48.417 --> 00:52.239
...along with a fast new browser, a more intuitive operating system,...

00:52.496 --> 00:56.278
...and a revamped library featuring more than 70,000 apps.

00:56.646 --> 01:00.732
The Z10 looks much like the touchscreen phones popularized by its rivals,...

01:01.045 --> 01:05.691
...but the Q10 maintains the "qwerty" keyboard that has become BlackBerry's trademark.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.165
Besides the technical and cosmetic updates,...

01:08.519 --> 01:12.785
...Heins says the company will no longer be called RIM, or Research in Motion.

01:13.111 --> 01:18.723
Our customers use a BlackBerry, our employees work for BlackBerry,...

01:19.507 --> 01:22.607
...and our shareholders are owners of BlackBerry.

01:23.785 --> 01:28.470
From today on, we are BlackBerry everywhere in the world.

01:29.955 --> 01:33.343
Shareholders will be watching if customers adopt the new devices.

01:33.657 --> 01:37.465
The company's stock has dropped as much as 90 percent in the last four years...

01:37.684 --> 01:39.457
...as it lost ground to competitors,...

01:39.823 --> 01:42.299
...but company shares have doubled in the last four months...

01:42.547 --> 01:44.681
...as anticipation grew for the new models.

01:45.137 --> 01:47.763
Analysts say the new devices could make or break a company...

01:48.085 --> 01:52.319
...that many credit for starting the technological revolution in smartphones.
