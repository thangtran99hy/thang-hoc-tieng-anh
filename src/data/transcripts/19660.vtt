'GI Joe: Retaliation' is the kind of film that earns money for Hollywood...

00:06.107 --> 00:10.581
...by appealing to teenage boys with action, fighting, and explosions.

00:12.087 --> 00:15.460
Tim Gray edits the entertainment business publication, 'Variety.'

00:15.873 --> 00:18.315
He says the debate over violent entertainment...

00:18.413 --> 00:22.663
...goes back to the paper's founding 100 years ago, and even further.

00:22.925 --> 00:28.201
It actually goes back 2,000 years. If you look at the plays that the Greeks wrote,...

00:28.347 --> 00:32.843
...the Greek tragedies, if you think about the gladiators in the Colosseum,...

00:33.533 --> 00:39.452
...violence and entertainment have always gone together, but it's so pervasive now.

00:39.544 --> 00:40.533
That's the big difference.

00:42.039 --> 00:46.041
The scene from Alfred Hitchcock's film, 'Psycho', was one short segment,...

00:46.106 --> 00:50.131
...in a highly crafted film that relied on dialog to tell the story.

00:50.608 --> 00:53.963
Still, in 1960, it shocked audiences.

00:54.168 --> 00:57.172
The upcoming Sylvester Stallone film, 'Bullet to the Head',...

00:57.471 --> 00:59.805
...uses action to hold the viewer's attention.

01:01.054 --> 01:04.618
The science fiction film, 'Pacific Rim', about an alien invasion,...

01:04.825 --> 01:07.812
...should also draw its share of adolescent boys.

01:08.063 --> 01:12.278
One producer, whose credits include the early Martin Scorsese film, 'Mean Streets' ,...

01:12.627 --> 01:14.157
...is now a media analyst.

01:14.343 --> 01:21.190
Jonathan Taplin says guns, explosions, and exciting chases sometimes substitute for careful storytelling.

01:21.479 --> 01:25.876
Action films are action films, and that's one of the things that Hollywood does well,...

01:26.103 --> 01:36.597
...and I'm not positive they know how to sustain a teenage audience without a lot of violence.

01:37.619 --> 01:41.759
Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association, the powerful gun lobby,...

01:42.049 --> 01:46.379
...has blamed game and movie makers for the ongoing violence in the real world.

01:46.747 --> 01:49.442
He rejects calls for stricter gun controls,...

01:49.685 --> 01:54.211
...but much of the world watches Hollywood entertainment without a problem, says Taplin.

01:54.693 --> 02:01.730
You don't see mass shootings of children in many, many countries...

02:01.870 --> 02:07.259
...where Hollywood movies are the key source of entertainment.

02:08.688 --> 02:12.652
Still, Taplin is disturbed by the violence that pervades American films,...

02:12.896 --> 02:15.049
...especially those from Quentin Tarantino.

02:15.475 --> 02:17.889
Tarantino's new release, 'Django Unchained' ,...

02:18.203 --> 02:23.259
...tells a story of slavery and retribution in the American South before the Civil War.

02:23.809 --> 02:26.721
The recent school shootings have many in Hollywood asking...

02:26.807 --> 02:31.576
...whether movie makers need to tone down the violence, says Variety editor Tim Gray.

02:31.964 --> 02:35.157
People are talking about the Connecticut shootings as if it's the tipping point;...

02:35.555 --> 02:36.756
...that could make a difference.

02:37.721 --> 02:40.485
Maybe, but we have heard that before.

02:40.798 --> 02:43.837
But young audiences show no signs they are losing interest...

02:43.935 --> 02:45.757
...in viewing violent films.

02:46.036 --> 02:48.899
