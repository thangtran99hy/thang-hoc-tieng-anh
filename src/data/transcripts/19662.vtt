00:08.977 --> 00:13.350
With "Lincoln", Steven Spielberg created not only an Oscar-worthy film...

00:13.669 --> 00:14.809
...but a new classic.

00:16.546 --> 00:19.461
His meticulous research and his subtle direction...

00:19.819 --> 00:24.515
...bring to life the 16th president of the United States in all his complexity.

00:31.093 --> 00:35.233
Spielberg has been a force in Hollywood for nearly four decades.

00:44.177 --> 00:46.519
His first big success was "Jaws",...

00:46.666 --> 00:51.083
...about the hunt for a killer shark off the coast of New York's Long Island.

00:51.781 --> 00:56.845
It won three Academy Awards and established Spielberg as a master of suspense:...

00:57.025 --> 01:02.998
...a title he reclaimed with his science fiction film "Close Encounters of the Third Kind".

01:06.100 --> 01:10.893
A few years later, Spielberg returned with "E.T. the Extraterrestrial";...

01:11.227 --> 01:15.395
...the poignant story of a boy who befriends an alien stranded on earth.

01:16.023 --> 01:18.887
It became the top grossing film of all time.

01:23.609 --> 01:27.568
Other blockbusters like the "Indiana Jones" trilogy followed.

01:34.275 --> 01:40.119
His crowning achievement was the 1993 holocaust epic "Schindler's List"...

01:40.419 --> 01:42.429
...based on the story of Oscar Schindler...

01:42.861 --> 01:47.167
...who risked his life to save more than a thousand Jews from the gas chambers.

01:49.640 --> 01:55.248
The film earned Spielberg his first Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture.

02:05.365 --> 02:09.422
In "Saving Private Ryan", Spielberg again focused on the second World War...

02:09.776 --> 02:12.425
...and won another Academy Award for Best Director.

02:19.149 --> 02:21.597
Now, fifteen years later with "Lincoln",...

02:21.903 --> 02:24.634
...Spielberg is a continuing force in cinema,...

02:25.122 --> 02:27.857
...crafting history for millions of moviegoers.

02:31.020 --> 02:35.908
Ang Lee's Oscar nominated film "Life of Pi" about an Indian boy adrift...

02:36.242 --> 02:39.809
...with a Bengal tiger is a visual masterpiece.

02:40.489 --> 02:43.176
Lee's cinematography and special effects...

02:43.327 --> 02:46.866
...make the sea and the kinetic tiger supporting characters.

02:51.653 --> 02:53.971
For Ang Lee, success came late in life.

02:54.757 --> 02:59.989
He won acclaim for his 1995 British period piece "Sense and Sensibility".

03:00.693 --> 03:06.704
From then on, he became famous for his nuanced treatment of culturally diverse stories.

03:08.653 --> 03:11.925
In 1997, he directed the "Ice Storm"...

03:12.370 --> 03:16.437
...about dysfunctional families in the affluent New York suburbs.

03:29.435 --> 03:34.759
In 1999, his "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" about Chinese martial arts...

03:35.207 --> 03:37.917
...won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.

03:38.971 --> 03:43.715
But Lee's climactic moment came in 2005 with "Brokeback Mountain"...

03:43.979 --> 03:48.827
...about the forbidden love between two gay cowboys in the American West.

03:49.526 --> 03:54.189
Lee's tender story put gay romance into the American mainstream.

03:58.879 --> 04:02.585
The film was nominated for Best Picture but lost to another,...

04:02.837 --> 04:05.414
...many say because of its subject matter,...

04:06.025 --> 04:09.475
...yet Ang Lee received the Oscar for Best Director.

04:10.781 --> 04:17.049
This year with Life of Pi, Lee focuses on an Indian family and the universality of faith...

04:17.151 --> 04:19.437
...as a source of strength and courage.

04:20.761 --> 04:27.202
Ang Lee and Steven Spielberg go toe-to-toe as master filmmakers of their generation.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.839
