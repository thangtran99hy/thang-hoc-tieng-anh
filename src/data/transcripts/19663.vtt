00:08.176 --> 00:13.145
Steven Spielberg's 'Lincoln' leads the pack with 12 Academy Award nominations,...

00:13.463 --> 00:18.417
...including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Daniel Day-Lewis.

00:19.462 --> 00:23.681
Few of the other contenders could pose a threat to the 16th US president,...

00:24.083 --> 00:26.262
...but there can be surprises.

00:30.525 --> 00:34.823
Director Ang Lee's 'Life of Pi' trails with 11 nominations...

00:35.161 --> 00:38.632
...and has all the ingredients for an Oscar in the Best Picture category.

00:39.139 --> 00:47.177
Lee's phantasmagoric cinematography enhances the story of an Indian boy adrift at sea with a Bengal tiger.

00:47.784 --> 00:51.437
The superb editing and music make for an on-screen magic...

00:51.839 --> 00:55.567
...and the Academy's voters may be swayed by this fairy tale.

01:00.113 --> 01:04.283
Tom Hooper's remake of 'Les MisÃ©rables' follows with eight nominations.

01:04.875 --> 01:07.803
Hugh Jackman would be eschewing for Best Actor...

01:08.143 --> 01:10.224
...if Daniel Day-Lewis were not running.

01:15.804 --> 01:18.273
And despite her barely adequate vocals,...

01:18.471 --> 01:21.891
...Anne Hathaway is considered a favorite for Best Supporting Actress...

01:22.269 --> 01:24.831
...for her depiction of the dying Fantine.

01:25.339 --> 01:30.367
But the sets are stilted, and Russell Crowe's 'Javert' is weak.
