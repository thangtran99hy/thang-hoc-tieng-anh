What I'm doing is called beat juggling.

00:03.775 --> 00:07.964
So, essentially you're taking one record and putting it on both turntables.

00:08.040 --> 00:13.097
So while this one plays, I'm getting this one ready to start back over the beginning of a loop.

00:13.928 --> 00:18.943
Sean Johnson is in an advanced mixing class, his final course at the Beat Refinery.

00:19.382 --> 00:24.081
He's been taking evening classes at the DJ school outside Washington for about two years.

00:24.571 --> 00:26.907
By day, he works as an audio engineer.

00:27.805 --> 00:29.018
I don't do that full-time anymore.

00:29.299 --> 00:31.875
I'm slowly working my way into being a full-time DJ.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.617
It is really just kind of making a dream come to life.

00:35.457 --> 00:39.310
Twelve-year-old Ethan Feinberg has been taking classes here for a year and a half.

00:39.706 --> 00:44.263
Well, I want to be a DJ when I am older, and I really like music.

00:45.077 --> 00:45.749
And it's fun.

00:46.169 --> 00:49.603
We have 10-year-olds all the way up to 50-year-olds.

00:49.780 --> 00:55.404
Women, men, all nationalities, sometimes we've had students that can't even speak English...

00:55.667 --> 00:58.323
...but there is the music that brings them together.

00:58.679 --> 01:03.059
Longtime DJ Chris Stiles cofounded the Beat Refinery in 2010.

01:03.346 --> 01:06.361
It is the only DJ school in the Washington area.

01:07.070 --> 01:08.705
We felt that there was a need to have the school...

01:08.993 --> 01:13.425
...because in today's world you see a lot of different places where people use DJs...

01:13.695 --> 01:18.049
...whether it's at weddings or at bars, clubs or clothing stores.

01:18.674 --> 01:24.115
The profession of a DJ has become a very sought-after job.

01:26.701 --> 01:30.049
The school offers classes for those wanting to become professionals...

01:30.361 --> 01:33.161
...as well as those who just want to mix party music for friends.
