00:06.275 --> 00:11.071
Dear Brothers, I have convoked you to this consistory, not only for the three canonizations,...

00:11.178 --> 00:15.928
...but also to communicate to you a decision of great importance for the life of the Church.

00:16.694 --> 00:20.038
After having repeatedly examined my conscience before God,...

00:20.117 --> 00:24.491
...I have come to the certainty that my strengths, due to an advanced age,...

00:24.924 --> 00:28.769
...are no longer suited to an adequate exercise of the Petrine ministry.

00:29.455 --> 00:32.952
I am well aware that this ministry, due to its essential spiritual nature,...

00:33.100 --> 00:37.978
...must be carried out not only with words and deeds, but no less with prayer and suffering.

00:38.548 --> 00:42.297
However, in today's world, subject to so many rapid changes...

00:42.787 --> 00:46.604
...and shaken by questions of deep relevance for the life of faith,...

00:47.128 --> 00:50.299
...in order to govern the barque of Saint Peter and proclaim the Gospel,...

00:50.431 --> 00:55.419
...both strength of mind and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months,...

00:55.497 --> 01:01.012
...has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity...

01:01.091 --> 01:03.923
...to adequately fill the ministry entrusted to me.

01:04.773 --> 01:08.004
For this reason, and well aware of the seriousness of this act,...

01:08.109 --> 01:13.087
...with full freedom I declare that I renounce the ministry of Bishop of Rome,...

01:13.158 --> 01:18.937
...Successor of Saint Peter, entrusted to me by the cardinals on the 19th of April 2005,...

01:19.413 --> 01:25.429
...in such a way, that as from 28 February 2013, at 8 PM,...

01:26.035 --> 01:31.015
...the See of Rome, the See of Saint Peter, will be vacant and the conclave...

01:31.130 --> 01:37.077
...to elect a new Supreme Pontiff will have to be convoked by those whose competence it is.

01:37.757 --> 01:41.420
Dear Brothers, I thank you most sincerely for all the love and work...

01:41.637 --> 01:44.481
...with which you have supported me in my ministry...

01:45.137 --> 01:47.640
...and I ask pardon for all my defects.

01:48.305 --> 01:52.835
And now, let us entrust the Holy Church to the care of our Supreme Pastor,...

01:54.161 --> 01:58.153
...our Lord Jesus Christ, and implore his Mother Mary,...

01:58.742 --> 02:02.960
...so that she may assist the cardinal Fathers with her maternal solicitude,...

02:03.439 --> 02:05.897
...in electing a new Supreme Pontiff.

02:06.802 --> 02:11.278
With regard to myself, I wish to also devotedly serve the Holy Church of God...

02:11.351 --> 02:14.769
...in the future through a life dedicated to prayer.
