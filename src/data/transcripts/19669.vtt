00:01.751 --> 00:07.549
From the start, Pope Benedict faced a difficult road following the popular Pope John Paul II.

00:08.349 --> 00:09.414
Embraced by some,...

00:12.311 --> 00:13.385
We are very happy.

00:13.628 --> 00:15.569
We're hoping it would be him, definitely.

00:16.169 --> 00:17.456
...shunned by others.

00:17.593 --> 00:20.489
I was frankly devastated when I heard the choice of Ratzinger.

00:21.019 --> 00:25.620
The pope was born Joseph Ratzinger in a small town in Germany in 1927,...

00:26.014 --> 00:27.413
...the son of a police officer.

00:27.907 --> 00:30.318
As a young man, he studied at a seminary.

00:30.619 --> 00:33.967
In World War II, he said, he was forced to join the Hitler Youth,...

00:34.521 --> 00:37.243
...though he said he defected as the war neared an end.

00:37.852 --> 00:43.477
He was ordained in 1951 and taught theology before working his way up the Church hierarchy.

00:44.125 --> 00:48.419
The further up the ranks he climbed, the more conservative his views became.

00:49.004 --> 00:54.233
When he became pope in 2005, his first message was one of humility.

00:58.257 --> 01:02.305
The cardinals have elected me, a simple, humble worker in the vineyard of the Lord.

01:03.063 --> 01:07.210
The fact that the Lord can work and act even with insufficient means consoles me.

01:07.758 --> 01:10.395
And above all, I entrust myself to your prayers.

01:11.105 --> 01:14.141
At times, Pope Benedict's papacy was rocky.

01:16.247 --> 01:21.120
In 2006, he enraged Muslims during a speech at a German university...

01:21.631 --> 01:24.165
...when he quoted the words of a medieval emperor.

01:28.549 --> 01:30.517
"Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new..."

01:30.777 --> 01:34.196
"...and there you will find things only evil and inhuman,..."

01:34.669 --> 01:37.848
"...such as his command to spread by the sword of the faith he preached."

01:38.521 --> 01:40.677
Reaction was swift and angry.

01:41.450 --> 01:45.079
Later that year, the pope traveled to Turkey and prayed at the Blue Mosque.

01:45.587 --> 01:48.428
He met with Muslim and Arab leaders through the years.

01:49.309 --> 01:51.501
For much of his reign, the Church was embroiled...

01:51.585 --> 01:54.809
...in what seemed to be an ever widening priest sex abuse scandal.

01:55.653 --> 02:00.853
In 2010, the pope apologized and promised, "Never again."

02:05.597 --> 02:09.435
"We too insistently beg forgiveness from God and from the persons involved,..."

02:10.017 --> 02:15.035
"...while promising to do everything possible to ensure that such abuse will never occur again."

02:15.862 --> 02:21.017
Pope Benedict was known for his conservative views on abortion, homosexuality and birth control.

02:21.688 --> 02:23.755
But he created a stir about a year ago,...

02:24.134 --> 02:27.786
...when he wrote that condoms could be justified in cases of prostitution...

02:28.234 --> 02:32.573
...to reduce the risk of HIV, though some said it came too late.

02:33.208 --> 02:36.223
The pope also moved the Catholic Church into the Digital Age,...

02:36.625 --> 02:38.493
...sending his first tweet in December.

02:39.180 --> 02:44.326
He also got the Vatican its first electric car, having expressed concerns about the environment.

02:45.218 --> 02:49.459
At the start of his papacy, Pope Benedict was seen as a choice for continuity.

02:49.903 --> 02:54.752
It now will be up to history to determine whether he fulfilled that role as caretaker...

02:55.353 --> 02:58.379
...or whether his impact on the Church will be greater.

02:59.724 --> 03:01.898
