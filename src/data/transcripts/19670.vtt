A foreign army invaded the United States in last year's remake of 'Red Dawn',...

00:08.603 --> 00:11.750
...but producers made a change before the film was released.

00:12.061 --> 00:14.563
The story of Americans fighting off invaders...

00:14.821 --> 00:17.674
...originally had Chinese soldiers as the villains.

00:17.965 --> 00:19.449
Now, they're North Koreans,...

00:19.619 --> 00:22.775
...so Chinese audiences or censors are not offended.

00:23.731 --> 00:26.669
Some big action films also have a China connection.

00:27.048 --> 00:30.358
The upcoming Iron Man 3 was partly filmed in China,...

00:30.601 --> 00:34.293
...and its script was subject to scrutiny by Chinese officials.

00:35.211 --> 00:39.354
And Chinese sensibilities influence the disaster epic '2012',...

00:39.607 --> 00:42.951
...says Stanley Rosen of the University of Southern California.

00:43.313 --> 00:45.237
He studies China's film industry.

00:45.714 --> 00:49.143
Even if you're not shooting in China, a film like '2012' will be very careful...

00:50.082 --> 00:52.259
...to include positive references to China.

00:53.558 --> 00:56.359
Negative references will simply kill the market.

00:56.659 --> 01:01.341
The reason spy thriller 'Skyfall' had scenes cut for Chinese audiences,...

01:01.632 --> 01:04.023
...and the science fiction film 'Cloud Atlas'...

01:04.203 --> 01:07.417
...lost 40 minutes of its action on the cutting room floor.

01:07.845 --> 01:11.292
But Chinese audiences love big movies with special effects,...

01:11.481 --> 01:15.888
...so Hollywood films account for half of the receipts from Chinese theaters.

01:16.297 --> 01:19.889
Chinese-born actress Lisa Lu played China's dowager empress...

01:20.113 --> 01:23.920
...in Bernardo Bertolucci's 1987 epic, 'The Last Emperor',...

01:24.330 --> 01:26.959
...a Chinese co-production mostly filmed in China.

01:27.307 --> 01:31.447
She says today's market has created solid roles for Asian actors.

01:31.568 --> 01:33.838
That wasn't true in the 1950s.

01:34.039 --> 01:41.225
So, all they wrote were either laborers or wash women...

01:41.610 --> 01:44.939
...or a dragon lady who has a restaurant.

01:45.067 --> 01:49.539
China's expanding middle class has given a boost to the country's own film industry.

01:49.893 --> 01:53.338
Last year's comedy 'Lost in Thailand' from director Xu Zheng...

01:53.640 --> 01:56.547
...was a huge box office success, coming in second...

01:56.624 --> 02:00.170
...in all-time Chinese film revenues after Hollywood's 'Avatar.'

02:00.725 --> 02:06.690
China is also an attractive film location with low production costs and many sets, says Lisa Lu.

02:07.157 --> 02:10.968
Streets of Europe, streets of New York, streets of China,...

02:11.424 --> 02:14.504
...you go there and you can have everything you need.

02:14.707 --> 02:18.385
Hollywood studios are finding Chinese partners for co-productions,...

02:18.603 --> 02:20.647
...and Disney and DreamWorks Animation...

02:20.869 --> 02:24.754
...are investing in tourist attractions in Shanghai, says Stanley Rosen.

02:25.223 --> 02:28.601
It's an evolving relationship, and Hollywood needs China,...

02:28.900 --> 02:30.882
...as the North American market has been flat.

02:32.059 --> 02:33.761
But China needs Hollywood as well,...

02:34.021 --> 02:36.643
...as you see with DreamWorks going in, Disney going in.

02:36.913 --> 02:38.743
And China is coming to Hollywood.

02:39.024 --> 02:42.204
The Chinese company TCL has purchased naming rights...

02:42.287 --> 02:45.820
...to the historic Grauman's Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard,...

02:46.230 --> 02:48.830
...and the Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group...

02:49.087 --> 02:52.281
...has bought a major American theater chain, AMC.

02:52.852 --> 02:56.767
The ties between China and Hollywood are expected to grow in the future.

02:57.155 --> 03:00.053
