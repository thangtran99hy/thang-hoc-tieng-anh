When we invented the smartphone we didn't quite appreciate what we'd started.

00:06.823 --> 00:10.525
Liberating people from their desks was a defining moment in technology...

00:10.652 --> 00:14.074
...that proved to be the kind of leap that would inspire a generation.

00:14.793 --> 00:18.095
Over the years we remained focused on creating the tools...

00:18.303 --> 00:21.123
...used by the people who make and build our world.

00:21.660 --> 00:27.543
We stayed true to our values of security, productivity, and best in class communications.

00:28.999 --> 00:31.795
There comes a time when every company has to evolve,...

00:32.185 --> 00:36.166
...to become re-inspired by that which first made them great...

00:36.569 --> 00:39.059
...and create a vision for the next leap.

00:40.167 --> 00:44.829
We have been quietly pouring our heart and soul into the foundation of this next evolution...

00:45.165 --> 00:48.763
...and have invested in world-class innovators to help us realize it.

00:49.411 --> 00:53.737
From QNX, the operating system so stable, secure, and fast...

00:54.117 --> 00:58.204
...that is relied upon by the likes of NASA to ensure the safety of human life,...

00:58.561 --> 01:00.127
...to the astonishing tribe...

01:00.371 --> 01:04.130
...who designed the most beautiful and functional interfaces the world has ever seen.

01:05.010 --> 01:08.102
Years of investment, innovation, hard work...

01:08.452 --> 01:10.423
...in the intense pursuit of our passion.

01:10.995 --> 01:13.227
It's finally about to bear its fruit.

01:13.892 --> 01:16.832
An all new flawless mobile experience:...

01:17.251 --> 01:20.175
...solid, secure, beautiful.

01:20.821 --> 01:25.578
Best in class communications backed by thousands of the apps and games you love...

01:25.827 --> 01:30.233
...and a lightning-fast web browser capable of viewing every website in the world...

01:30.491 --> 01:32.282
...with no compromises or limits.

01:32.872 --> 01:36.120
Blackberry 10 has arrived.
