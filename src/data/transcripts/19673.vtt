00:00.083 --> 00:02.725
Fast, accurate, and effortless typing.

00:03.695 --> 00:06.052
The new BlackBerry Z10 smartphone,...

00:06.161 --> 00:07.503
...powered by BlackBerry 10,...

00:07.729 --> 00:10.797
...introduces the most intuitive touchscreen typing experience.

00:11.568 --> 00:14.019
We've created a keyboard that, for the first time,...

00:14.289 --> 00:17.861
...enables you to type with speed, accuracy, and confidence.

00:18.730 --> 00:19.328
Design.

00:20.365 --> 00:23.569
The keyboard position makes one or two thumb typing easy...

00:23.807 --> 00:26.117
...at the same time as maximizing the screen area.

00:26.671 --> 00:30.781
We've used a QWERTY keyboard to maximize the width of keys and stagger the rows...

00:31.100 --> 00:36.018
...and created high contrast between dark keys and white characters for better legibility.

00:36.309 --> 00:39.261
Frets visually organize rows and improve targeting.

00:39.909 --> 00:42.839
We've also positioned the contact targets for better accuracy.

00:43.248 --> 00:44.235
You'll never miss a letter.

00:45.111 --> 00:47.253
Next, word suggestions appear in key,...

00:47.769 --> 00:50.799
...so the word appears where your eyes and fingers are headed next.

00:52.024 --> 00:55.664
The animation and audio feedback creates a near physical feedback...

00:55.906 --> 00:58.433
....that builds confidence and assists muscle memory.

00:59.592 --> 01:00.348
Performance.

01:01.301 --> 01:05.534
For faster two thumb typing, reduced latency means you can press the next key...

01:05.649 --> 01:09.081
...as you release the last one, as you would on any QWERTY keyboard.

01:09.638 --> 01:12.161
A keyboard that understands and adapts to you.

01:12.969 --> 01:14.728
After just six to eight keystrokes,...

01:14.822 --> 01:18.243
...our heat mapping technology starts to recognize where you hit keys...

01:18.401 --> 01:20.084
...and learns to correct missed strikes.

01:21.229 --> 01:24.635
When you set up your new BlackBerry Z10 device on BlackBerry 10,...

01:24.929 --> 01:28.255
...the powerful engine scans your messages from the last seven days...

01:28.532 --> 01:31.550
...and starts to create a language model that's specific to you.

01:31.973 --> 01:34.917
You can also enable up to three languages to be active at once...

01:35.233 --> 01:36.385
...so you can move between them...

01:36.831 --> 01:39.899
...with word suggestions and corrections keeping up as you go.

01:40.742 --> 01:42.656
Only on the new BlackBerry Z10.

01:43.106 --> 01:44.667
Powered by BlackBerry 10.

01:45.208 --> 01:45.961
Keep moving.
