North Korea's nuclear program is moving ahead despite years of international sanctions.

00:06.954 --> 00:10.143
Newly confirmed Secretary of State John Kerry said this week...

00:10.490 --> 00:14.463
...that North Korean nuclear tests only increase the potential for conflict.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.001
And the people of North Korea are starving.

00:18.666 --> 00:24.334
They desperately need to become more open and connected to the world...

00:24.868 --> 00:28.823
...instead of harboring some of the worst gulags in the world...

00:29.541 --> 00:32.472
...where people are tortured and forced labor...

00:33.149 --> 00:36.149
State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the US...

00:36.233 --> 00:40.578
...will make sure last month's Security Council resolution, broadening sanctions...

00:40.656 --> 00:44.499
...against Pyongyang for its nuclear weapons program, will be enforced.

00:44.755 --> 00:47.175
We can ensure that that's not just a piece of paper,...

00:47.268 --> 00:50.401
...that those sanctions are implemented around the international community.

00:50.967 --> 00:54.044
But Georgetown University professor Balbina Hwang says...

00:54.145 --> 00:57.031
...this approach doesn't sway North Korea's leaders.

00:57.353 --> 01:04.892
That only works if the regime views integration into the international community as a positive goal.

01:05.441 --> 01:09.245
The problem is North Korea has never wanted to join the international community.

01:09.382 --> 01:13.122
North Korea won't even be deterred by threatened penalties from China,...

01:13.273 --> 01:16.029
...its main source of food and fuel, she says.

01:16.575 --> 01:18.251
It will basically be calling China's bluff.

01:18.549 --> 01:22.058
At a time of domestic unrest in China and a slowing economy,...

01:22.242 --> 01:25.438
...Beijing views the test as a destabilizing factor....

01:25.519 --> 01:29.375
...says Professor Jin Canrong of the Renmin University of China.

01:31.069 --> 01:33.080
There were too many problems for the leadership.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.311
They do not want to have problems abroad.

01:36.360 --> 01:41.773
Experts say the North Korean test will make it more difficult to halt Iran's nuclear program...

01:41.927 --> 01:44.054
...because the two nations share technology.

01:44.454 --> 01:47.429
