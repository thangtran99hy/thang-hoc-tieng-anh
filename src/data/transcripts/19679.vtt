00:09.916 --> 00:10.483
Time.

00:13.003 --> 00:14.257
So much to answer for.

00:16.439 --> 00:17.748
Never enough hours in the day.

00:19.717 --> 00:21.323
Not enough days in the week.

00:22.880 --> 00:24.853
Everyone wants a little piece of you.

00:27.079 --> 00:28.186
It's time you stopped,...

00:29.397 --> 00:30.189
...switched off,...

00:31.469 --> 00:32.599
...forgot about time.

00:35.397 --> 00:38.093
Put down your phone and hold your loved one's hand.

00:39.673 --> 00:40.561
Nice, isn't it?

00:43.216 --> 00:46.847
Those close to you, share with them a week or two,...

00:47.360 --> 00:49.406
...and they'll cherish it forever.

00:54.302 --> 00:55.880
The time you spent on holiday,...

00:57.169 --> 00:59.129
...the time when nothing matters.

01:00.548 --> 01:03.867
When there's just you, the sky, the sea...

01:04.751 --> 01:07.559
...and the people who mean everything in the world to you.

01:12.885 --> 01:15.571
Holidays are the most precious time of all.

01:18.777 --> 01:20.003
Let this be a lesson.
