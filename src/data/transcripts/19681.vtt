00:04.033 --> 00:04.319
Whoa!

00:04.587 --> 00:07.221
Hey there Henderson family, I'm your RAV4 genie.

00:07.349 --> 00:08.503
Your wish is my command.

00:09.395 --> 00:10.840
Wish the old spare tire was gone.

00:10.949 --> 00:12.092
Really, out of everything in the...

00:12.248 --> 00:12.537
Okay.

00:14.063 --> 00:14.452
Oh no.

00:14.715 --> 00:15.718
I wish animals could talk.

00:15.800 --> 00:16.450
Much better.

00:16.895 --> 00:18.497
I wish the old spare tire was gone.

00:19.436 --> 00:21.230
Oh, I wish I could eat as much chocolate as I want.

00:21.425 --> 00:23.201
Well, your chocolate levels are dangerously low.

00:23.319 --> 00:26.279
Now Gladys is gonna start you on a chocolate IV and here's some free samples.

00:26.450 --> 00:27.468
I wish I was a princess.

00:27.590 --> 00:29.463
I want you to avenge my father's death.

00:30.367 --> 00:30.921
Yeah!

00:31.479 --> 00:32.117
I'm right here.

00:32.535 --> 00:34.122
I wish I was an astronaut.

00:37.192 --> 00:37.893
I wish...

00:37.958 --> 00:39.611
May I please have a turn?

00:43.497 --> 00:45.436
I said infinite wishes.

00:45.679 --> 00:46.643
I heard witches.

00:47.302 --> 00:48.288
Can I at least have my first wish?

00:48.560 --> 00:50.191
Now with Sirius XM...

00:51.345 --> 00:52.685
Is the dog really necessary?

00:53.146 --> 00:53.288
Yup.

00:54.852 --> 00:55.409
Knees up.

00:55.867 --> 00:56.967
The all new RAV4.

00:57.924 --> 00:58.423
Toyota.

00:58.734 --> 00:59.885
Let's go places.
