On Saint Peter's Square, visitors were eager to talk about the historic announcement.

00:07.637 --> 00:13.103
The first papal resignation in nearly 600 years drew news crews from around the world,...

00:13.444 --> 00:15.636
...who peppered tourists with questions.

00:15.879 --> 00:17.550
Most people were sympathetic.

00:18.616 --> 00:23.657
In one way I'm shocked because popes have quite often gone until they die...

00:23.785 --> 00:27.841
...but on another side, I have admiration for his choice.

00:28.321 --> 00:30.803
My parents called me all the way from Colombia to tell me.

00:30.940 --> 00:32.327
My parents are also very Catholic.

00:32.719 --> 00:35.315
So we are all a bit shocked like, why?

00:35.597 --> 00:36.799
I actually do understand.

00:36.869 --> 00:45.121
I think the past pope, John Paul, was very frail and infirm when he was in the office.

00:45.204 --> 00:49.020
And I think Pope Benedict has set a new standard, really.

00:49.318 --> 00:52.973
But one university student from a South Korean Catholic family...

00:53.121 --> 00:55.050
...thought the Pope made a bad decision.

00:55.319 --> 00:58.620
Well, the God selected him from the first time...

00:58.745 --> 01:02.665
...so I think he knew to do his duty 'til his death.

01:03.249 --> 01:07.296
Pope Benedict's papacy has been a difficult period for the Catholic Church...

01:07.643 --> 01:12.463
...particularly due to the continuing scandal over priests who abused young people.

01:12.940 --> 01:17.989
For that reason, Vatican correspondent Alessandro Speciale of the Religion News Service...

01:18.231 --> 01:20.405
...says the Church needs a strong leader.

01:20.655 --> 01:23.271
The Church is booming and is very young...

01:23.653 --> 01:26.822
...both as priests and as believers in the southern part of the world.

01:27.079 --> 01:30.294
And so this means there's a risk of cases such as this.

01:30.390 --> 01:31.667
It's still very high there,...

01:31.820 --> 01:34.625
...and both are potentially devastating for the Church.

01:34.839 --> 01:38.389
Speciale says tough guidelines and enforcement are needed...

01:38.555 --> 01:41.493
...to prevent the Church from losing the moral high ground...

01:41.580 --> 01:45.333
...in its main growth areas Africa and Latin America.

01:45.851 --> 01:48.759
On the Square, Tuesday, there was lots of speculation about...

01:48.894 --> 01:51.745
...whether the new Pope might come from one of those areas.

01:52.071 --> 01:54.771
Most visitors said they would welcome such a move,...

01:55.112 --> 02:00.144
...but they also said the Pope's ethnicity is not as important as his spirituality...

02:00.454 --> 02:03.338
...and his ability to inspire faith in others.
