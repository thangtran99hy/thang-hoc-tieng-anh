00:09.973 --> 00:13.712
At first glance, the Focus Electric looks like any other Ford Focus.

00:14.140 --> 00:18.050
You can really only tell by the few badges that are on the exterior of the vehicle.

00:18.531 --> 00:20.321
Instead of running on gasoline,...

00:20.676 --> 00:24.189
...there's an electric motor up-front and a battery pack in the back.

00:24.771 --> 00:27.711
Inside are lots of displays like a brake coach feature...

00:27.957 --> 00:30.335
...that help you get the most from regenerative braking.

00:30.856 --> 00:33.246
Inside, it's like any top-level Focus.

00:33.531 --> 00:34.477
Nicely finished.

00:34.878 --> 00:36.860
Optional leather seats are supportive.

00:37.369 --> 00:39.119
MyFord Touch is standard.

00:39.557 --> 00:43.243
It's overcomplicated and annoying with some busy screens.

00:43.781 --> 00:45.327
The backseat is pretty snug...

00:45.565 --> 00:46.876
...like the normal Focus.

00:47.188 --> 00:51.964
However, in the Focus EV, the battery pack takes up quite a bit of cargo space.

00:52.845 --> 00:56.202
The Focus Electric is an enjoyable, efficient car to drive.

00:56.477 --> 00:59.014
It finally shows that going green can be fun.
