00:06.393 --> 00:09.905
Nurturing a long-distance romance takes patience, understanding...

00:10.154 --> 00:12.473
...and a working knowledge of the latest technology.

00:12.794 --> 00:17.091
You will need: a camera phone, thoughtfulness and imagination.

00:17.431 --> 00:20.296
Optional: the ability to share live video.

00:20.766 --> 00:25.570
Step 1: Squeeze in daily chats about the mundane aspects of each other's lives,...

00:25.669 --> 00:27.224
...like how your respective days are going.

00:27.627 --> 00:29.801
Don't underestimate the importance of the small stuff...

00:30.148 --> 00:31.786
...that's what relationships are built on.

00:33.859 --> 00:36.199
Dash off short text messages throughout the day,...

00:36.416 --> 00:39.033
...rather than sending one long-winded one at night.

00:39.427 --> 00:43.843
Step 2: Exchange pictures every day, not just of yourselves,...

00:43.989 --> 00:45.781
...but of interesting things you saw or did.

00:46.059 --> 00:48.815
Send video of your office, dorm, or new hangout.

00:49.109 --> 00:52.555
It's easier to handle being apart when you can picture each other's surroundings.

00:52.968 --> 00:56.234
Step 3: Assure your partner that you ain't misbehaving...

00:56.359 --> 00:58.375
...by sending proof of your whereabouts.

00:59.913 --> 01:03.177
Step 4: Celebrate occasions big and small...

01:03.309 --> 01:06.254
...by picking a time to have a simultaneous celebratory drink...

01:06.603 --> 01:09.282
...and send each other photos or video of you toasting.

01:10.073 --> 01:13.426
If your phones have live video share, you can toast each other live.

01:13.919 --> 01:17.379
Step 5: Download your song as your ringtone,...

01:17.473 --> 01:20.621
...so you're romantically reminded every time your phone rings.

01:21.839 --> 01:26.017
Step 6: Before you buy something pricey or do anything drastic,...

01:26.191 --> 01:28.905
...check in with your partner so you can make decisions as a team...

01:29.132 --> 01:30.636
...even though you're miles apart.

01:34.203 --> 01:37.672
Step 7: Distance can magnify hurt feelings,...

01:37.881 --> 01:41.255
...so if you screw up, go the extra mile to apologize.

01:54.492 --> 01:55.193
Did you know?

01:55.551 --> 01:58.259
Research shows that couples in long-distance relationships...

01:58.375 --> 02:01.403
...are no more likely to cheat than those who are geographically close,...

02:01.646 --> 02:04.115
...but they fret more about their partner straying.
