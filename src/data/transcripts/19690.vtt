00:06.503 --> 00:09.777
Mardi Gras is a mid winter revelry that has ancient origins.

00:09.993 --> 00:12.691
Here are some ways to make meaning of the madness.

00:13.373 --> 00:18.308
You will need: a trip to Rome, a medieval cathedral, a feast,...

00:18.711 --> 00:21.598
...a trip to New Orleans, and a king cake.

00:21.999 --> 00:24.197
Step one: take a trip to Rome.

00:24.371 --> 00:28.247
The ancient Romans celebrated a raucous festival known as Lupercalia...

00:28.379 --> 00:29.951
...each year in mid February.

00:30.250 --> 00:34.595
The festival was marked by cakes and the sacrifices of goats and a dog.

00:35.373 --> 00:39.082
Step two: to a medieval cathedral while you are in Italy.

00:39.943 --> 00:43.505
Just as the early Church found new interpretations for pagan rituals...

00:43.649 --> 00:45.951
...honoring the winter solstice and spring equinox,...

00:46.114 --> 00:48.822
...it transformed the Lupercalia into Mardi Gras.

00:49.967 --> 00:53.391
Mardi Gras is tied to Easter, which falls on the first Sunday...

00:53.530 --> 00:56.192
...after the full moon following the spring equinox.

00:57.326 --> 01:00.561
Step three: enjoy a feast the day before Lent.

01:01.043 --> 01:03.932
In medieval Europe, Mardi Gras was a day of feasting.

01:04.515 --> 01:07.081
It was marked by the slaughter of a bull or ox,...

01:07.352 --> 01:10.741
...and became known as Fat Tuesday, or Mardi Gras in French.

01:11.766 --> 01:14.587
Step four: hop a flight to New Orleans.

01:14.873 --> 01:18.975
French settlers brought Mardi Gras to Louisiana in the late 17th century,...

01:19.202 --> 01:23.227
...and the holiday was deeply rooted in New Orleans culture by the 1830s.

01:23.476 --> 01:26.582
A secret society called the Mistick Krewe of Comus...

01:26.723 --> 01:31.205
...staged the first large-scale Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans in 1857.

01:31.606 --> 01:35.053
Step five: enjoy a Mardi Gras king cake.

01:35.299 --> 01:40.253
These cakes are decorated in traditional Mardi Gras colors: purple, green, and gold.

01:40.629 --> 01:45.855
Purple represents justice; green represents faith; and gold represents power.

01:46.324 --> 01:50.461
Now, you can have your cake and make sense out of one of the best parties in the US.

01:51.624 --> 01:52.309
Did you know?

01:52.629 --> 01:57.576
Kern Studios was established in 1947 to create floats for Mardi Gras,...

01:57.845 --> 02:01.006
...and is now one of the largest float builders in the world.
