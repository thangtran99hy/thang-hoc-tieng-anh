00:00.088 --> 00:02.863
If you like bikes, then you should come to Copenhagen, Denmark...

00:03.105 --> 00:04.432
...because there are lots of them.

00:04.651 --> 00:06.597
Bikes, bikes, bikes, bikes, bikes, everywhere.

00:11.055 --> 00:13.750
Since I love bikes, I'm in a very good city to be.

00:13.939 --> 00:17.668
And if you happen to arrive in Denmark without your trusty bicycle, have no fear.

00:17.891 --> 00:19.219
You can rent one for free.

00:19.288 --> 00:20.261
All you need is...

00:20.521 --> 00:21.571
...20 crowns right here.

00:22.151 --> 00:24.103
It's this easy, stick it right in the little thing.

00:24.436 --> 00:25.498
Push it in, oh!

00:26.106 --> 00:28.591
You got yourself a happy face bicycle.

00:32.582 --> 00:35.785
There is no better way to see Copenhagen than by bike.

00:36.423 --> 00:37.622
Let's cruise!

00:48.781 --> 00:51.053
They take their biking so seriously in Copenhagen...

00:51.127 --> 00:54.329
...that the bikes have their own lane right next to the cars...

00:54.567 --> 00:56.342
...and right next to the sidewalk where everybody walks.

00:56.754 --> 00:59.921
If you step foot into the bike lane, get ready to get run over.

01:02.357 --> 01:04.677
And the great thing is people of all ages ride bikes.

01:04.747 --> 01:09.773
Moms, dads, old guys, young guys, and even the postman or woman.

01:11.037 --> 01:13.275
And to go along with the special bike lanes,...

01:13.593 --> 01:15.974
...there are also special bike traffic lights.

01:16.273 --> 01:17.207
Green means go!

01:23.459 --> 01:25.701
Bicycles are used for just about everything in Denmark...

01:25.814 --> 01:31.003
...like carrying kids and taking out the trash and newspapers and taxis.

01:31.323 --> 01:34.263
And whoa! What was that crazy Jetson-looking thing?

01:36.297 --> 01:38.996
So after you've ridden circles around this beautiful city of Copenhagen,...

01:39.072 --> 01:41.458
...you bring your bike back to one of these special bike racks,...

01:41.755 --> 01:43.451
...get your money back and you're ready to roll.

01:44.292 --> 01:46.946
Stick this thing in there, money pops out,...

01:47.333 --> 01:48.969
...you get a nice and shiny 20 crowns.

01:49.053 --> 01:49.983
You know what this is good for?

01:50.411 --> 01:50.926
A beer.

01:51.247 --> 01:51.969
Let's go get a beer.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.337
Cheers!

01:54.275 --> 01:55.177
Thanks for riding with me.
