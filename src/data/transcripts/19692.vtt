Hey guys.

00:02.572 --> 00:06.083
My name is Shallon and I'm here to help you with all the questions you might have...

00:06.161 --> 00:09.225
...about love, lust, romance, and everything in between.

00:09.558 --> 00:12.615
For more, visit me on Twitter @downtownshallon...

00:12.881 --> 00:16.871
...or be sure to check out my website, shallononline.com.

00:19.976 --> 00:23.704
There's nothing creepy or sketchy about meeting somebody on an online dating site,...

00:23.902 --> 00:27.201
...but that doesn't mean that there's not creepy and sketchy people...

00:27.546 --> 00:29.328
...on the online dating site.

00:29.677 --> 00:30.891
Here's a few things to look out for.

00:31.286 --> 00:34.423
Remember, there's no limit to how much somebody can lie.

00:34.748 --> 00:36.139
If a guy says he's 17,...

00:36.224 --> 00:38.979
...a lot of girls are like, "Well, he's you know maybe 18 or 19."

00:39.382 --> 00:40.739
No, he could be 50.

00:41.102 --> 00:42.991
People lie and they lie big.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.331
Also, don't give out too much of your personal information.

00:46.595 --> 00:49.741
A guy doesn't need your e-mail, your address, your phone number,...

00:49.979 --> 00:51.929
...your Twitter handle, your Facebook page,...

00:52.093 --> 00:54.158
...real in the contact that someone can have.

00:54.276 --> 00:56.249
You never know where something is going to lead...

00:56.545 --> 00:59.555
...and once you give someone that info it can't be taken back.

00:59.684 --> 01:02.581
It's really important to listen to your gut and your instinct,...

01:02.682 --> 01:05.539
...if you get kind of a bad feeling about somebody or anything.

01:05.936 --> 01:09.081
A respectable guy isn't gonna get mad that you want to postpone the meeting...

01:09.173 --> 01:11.048
...or maybe talk on the phone a little bit first...

01:11.133 --> 01:12.461
...or bring one of your friends along.

01:12.810 --> 01:15.695
A real man understands that it's important for a woman to feel safe,...

01:16.284 --> 01:19.012
...so don't be afraid to set limits and listen to your instincts...

01:19.232 --> 01:20.149
...because if you don't...

01:20.571 --> 01:22.653
...and you're just so flattered that he's giving you attention,...

01:22.891 --> 01:24.433
...it might be the wrong kind of attention.

01:24.923 --> 01:28.845
He might have a van with a tiger airbrushed on the side of it.

01:30.059 --> 01:31.205
Is that a chance you wanna take?

01:32.253 --> 01:33.084
I don't think so.
