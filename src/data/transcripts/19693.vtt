The Reverend John Gardiner delivering mass...

00:06.051 --> 00:09.273
...to followers at Saint Matthew's Cathedral in Washington.

00:09.730 --> 00:12.165
Some Catholics here pray for Pope Benedict...

00:12.295 --> 00:15.359
...after learning he was resigning because of failing health.

00:15.927 --> 00:19.696
Father Gardiner says he was not surprised the pope is stepping down.

00:20.203 --> 00:23.129
But it's going to be one heck of a job and I think that he's being realistic...

00:23.241 --> 00:27.985
...and he accepts the resignation of other bishops at age 75.

00:28.636 --> 00:31.150
I think in my mind this is the ultimate good example...

00:31.374 --> 00:34.292
...that he's not just talking the talk but walking the walk.

00:34.451 --> 00:38.749
Kate Courtien, a parishioner, says she was stunned when she heard the news.

00:38.923 --> 00:39.817
I think it's shocking.

00:40.668 --> 00:44.305
It's been 600 years since one has resigned.

00:44.715 --> 00:47.936
I'm sure people want to make sure that he's able to fulfill his job...

00:48.029 --> 00:50.999
...and if they felt that that wasn't done in the past,...

00:51.922 --> 00:54.953
...he may have just wanted to not cause any controversy.

00:55.279 --> 00:59.501
In New York with one of the largest Catholic populations in the United States,...

00:59.595 --> 01:03.476
...Cardinal Timothy Dolan said he was startled by the announcement.

01:03.715 --> 01:08.416
And I just always admired him as a scholar, as a priest, as a holy man.

01:09.102 --> 01:13.371
And now my admiration for him is even higher because of his humility.

01:13.821 --> 01:17.028
Others like Wayne gave a special prayer for the pope.

01:17.373 --> 01:20.193
I think Pope Benedict has done a great job...

01:20.285 --> 01:22.945
...and I just feel that we're blessed to have had him as pope...

01:23.103 --> 01:26.344
...and just thank him for his service to the Church.

01:27.297 --> 01:30.050
I just trust the Lord will help them make the right decision.

01:30.211 --> 01:33.999
Some Catholics say they hope the next pope will come from a developing nation,...

01:34.329 --> 01:36.777
...but others like John Vahey disagree.

01:37.526 --> 01:40.620
That's not as important to me as having a pope...

01:41.010 --> 01:48.525
...with potentially slightly more moderate views than the current Pope Ratzinger.

01:48.897 --> 01:54.016
Some US Catholics say the pope's resignation creates excitement and anticipation...

01:54.359 --> 01:57.417
...to see who will be the next leader of the Catholic Church.
