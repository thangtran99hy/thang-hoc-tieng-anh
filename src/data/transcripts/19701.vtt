Welcome to "An Introduction to Banking."

00:06.961 --> 00:09.180
What do we mean by the term "banking"?

00:09.786 --> 00:14.124
We all associate banking with banks, of course, so let's start there.

00:15.212 --> 00:20.295
The English word "bank" has 13th century origins in both German and Italian.

00:20.962 --> 00:24.073
When you hear the word "bank," you generally think of money, right?

00:24.834 --> 00:29.317
But actually, the word "bank" is derived from the Italian word "banca,"...

00:29.682 --> 00:32.435
...which evolved from a German word meaning "bench."

00:33.470 --> 00:35.566
What has banking got to do with benches?

00:36.184 --> 00:40.789
Well, in the past, Italian moneylenders used a bench or table...

00:40.879 --> 00:43.787
...in a large open area to conduct their business.

00:44.413 --> 00:48.997
So the word originally referred to the place where money lending transactions occurred.

00:50.099 --> 00:55.147
Today, the word "bank" refers to the institution which carries out banking services.

00:55.847 --> 00:59.271
It also refers to a building where banking services are provided.

01:00.007 --> 01:03.133
That is, the offices or buildings in which a bank is located.

01:04.102 --> 01:05.929
It can also be a verb.

01:06.487 --> 01:09.058
We can say "Who do you bank with?"

01:09.715 --> 01:14.877
Incidentally, the English term "bankrupt" is used to describe a person...

01:15.095 --> 01:18.904
...who has gone out of business because they could not meet all their liabilities.

01:19.675 --> 01:22.905
This term comes from the expression "banca rotta,"...

01:23.103 --> 01:25.123
...meaning "a physically broken bench."

01:26.353 --> 01:31.484
The English words cash, debtor, creditor, ledger,...

01:31.895 --> 01:34.913
...and the symbols for English currency, pounds and pence,...

01:35.247 --> 01:37.922
...all originate from the 13th century, too.
