There is no doubt that fraud is a global concern.

00:06.633 --> 00:09.384
In 2005, Unisys conducted a survey...

00:09.497 --> 00:12.650
...into the increasing prevalence of online identity theft.

00:13.502 --> 00:20.306
At that time, 17% of US and 11% of UK consumers reported being a victim.

00:21.353 --> 00:24.493
In 2006, a Gartner research survey...

00:24.633 --> 00:29.113
...found a 50% increase in ID theft victims compared to 2003.

00:30.115 --> 00:31.513
All the evidence shows that...

00:31.913 --> 00:35.548
...as the acceptance of financial products such as credit cards grows,...

00:36.055 --> 00:38.257
...the risk of ID fraud also increases.

00:38.997 --> 00:42.048
What seems obvious is that banks and their customers...

00:42.320 --> 00:45.180
...have a responsibility for remaining vigilant and up-to-date...

00:45.271 --> 00:49.655
...with online security measures in order to protect themselves from Internet hackers.

00:51.198 --> 00:55.584
Some people claim that biometric data, such as iris scans and fingerprints,...

00:55.888 --> 00:57.053
...could provide the answer.

00:57.707 --> 01:01.123
However, it could be argued that this will not solve the problem,...

01:01.416 --> 01:04.371
...as the usefulness of biometrics depends on the quality...

01:04.690 --> 01:08.309
...and therefore the cost of the machine and the technology used.

01:09.237 --> 01:12.207
Other people favour "two-factor identification."

01:12.779 --> 01:16.741
In addition to a password, confirmation by cellphone is required.

01:17.551 --> 01:20.915
Two-factor identification puts another step in the way of criminals.
