Welcome to the Law Faculty.

00:05.400 --> 00:09.049
I want to start my first lecture by asking a simple question.

00:09.623 --> 00:10.735
What is law?

00:11.701 --> 00:13.217
That's a very simple question, isn't it?

00:13.345 --> 00:14.835
We all know the answer, don't we?

00:15.455 --> 00:16.192
Let's see.

00:17.005 --> 00:19.875
We know that the law provides a set of rules...

00:19.946 --> 00:23.589
...that allows people to live in an organized and civilized way.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.731
If someone breaks a rule, there's a system of punishment...

00:27.101 --> 00:28.614
...that not only protects people...

00:28.965 --> 00:30.520
...but also provides a deterrent.

00:31.358 --> 00:34.386
That is, it deters or stops people from breaking the rule.

00:34.621 --> 00:35.127
Okay.

00:35.621 --> 00:38.546
But what are these rules and who decides what they are?

00:39.447 --> 00:43.773
For example, most people would agree that you should wash your hands before you eat a meal.

00:44.103 --> 00:46.168
If you don't, have you broken the law?

00:46.779 --> 00:50.397
In my household, my mother imposed this rule and if any of the children broke it,...

00:50.510 --> 00:51.369
...they were punished.

00:52.080 --> 00:56.015
But has someone who hasn't washed their hands before dinner broken the law?

00:56.907 --> 00:57.320
Well.

00:57.661 --> 01:00.095
Yes and no, or it depends.

01:00.901 --> 01:02.002
So what is law?

01:02.309 --> 01:04.998
What is the intrinsic meaning of the word?

01:05.510 --> 01:08.857
A word that we use every day and think we understand.
