In this week's lecture, we're going to be looking at the advantages...

00:05.785 --> 00:07.903
...and disadvantages of the jury system.

00:09.255 --> 00:12.446
A jury is a group of usually 12 ordinary people...

00:12.822 --> 00:15.845
...who have been selected to listen to the facts in a trial in a law court...

00:16.338 --> 00:18.505
...and decide on whether the case has been proved.

00:19.707 --> 00:22.089
It's claimed that the advantage of the jury system...

00:22.369 --> 00:26.037
...is that it ensures a fair trial, especially in criminal cases.

00:27.467 --> 00:31.858
People who are accused of an offence are tried by their peers, the general public,...

00:32.058 --> 00:35.480
...rather than trained lawyers, who used their common sense to reach a verdict...

00:35.623 --> 00:37.939
...based solely on the evidence they have heard in the case.

00:39.537 --> 00:42.077
However, in recent years many lawyers have argued...

00:42.170 --> 00:47.503
...that the disadvantage of the jury system is that in some cases, such as serious fraud,...

00:48.008 --> 00:51.643
...the facts are generally too complex for the ordinary person in the street to follow.
