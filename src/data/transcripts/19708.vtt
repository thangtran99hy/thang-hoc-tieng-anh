Last week, I talked about the composition and origins of the Earth's atmosphere.

00:08.175 --> 00:12.837
We also briefly looked at how biological processes have created an atmosphere...

00:12.915 --> 00:15.059
...that is conducive to terrestrial life.

00:16.051 --> 00:21.053
Today, we'll look at where ozone is found, how it's formed, how it's destroyed...

00:21.568 --> 00:23.237
...and the problems this may cause.

00:24.134 --> 00:27.203
Finally, we'll look at what actions have been taken by governments...

00:27.271 --> 00:30.298
...and international bodies to stop this destruction.

00:32.115 --> 00:37.227
Let's concentrate first on the ozone layer, which was briefly covered in last week's lecture.

00:38.189 --> 00:40.865
It's important because it acts as a shield,...

00:41.069 --> 00:45.309
...protecting animal and plant life from harmful ultraviolet radiation.

00:46.389 --> 00:48.335
There are actually two ozone layers:...

00:48.965 --> 00:52.683
...one of them occurs in the stratosphere, the other in the troposphere.

00:53.579 --> 00:58.389
The one in the stratosphere is by far the bigger of the two and is formed naturally.

00:59.447 --> 01:02.759
The ozone layer in the troposphere is anthropogenic.

01:03.688 --> 01:08.961
By this, I mean that the ozone that occurs in this layer has been produced by human activity.

01:10.549 --> 01:13.322
What are the chemical processes that create ozone?

01:14.157 --> 01:19.960
To start with, UV radiation splits an oxygen molecule into oxygen atoms.

01:20.743 --> 01:26.234
Then, one of these atoms combines with another oxygen molecule to form an ozone molecule.

01:27.301 --> 01:31.776
What's more, ozone is constantly being formed and destroyed;...

01:32.709 --> 01:37.783
...a natural balance between the production and destruction of these molecules seems to exist.

01:39.004 --> 01:40.983
This, however, has changed.

01:41.763 --> 01:44.146
From the beginning of the 20th century onwards,...

01:44.392 --> 01:47.250
...human industrial activity has upset this balance...

01:47.515 --> 01:52.167
...by producing chlorine-based chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons,...

01:52.878 --> 01:55.552
...more commonly abbreviated to CFCs.

01:56.683 --> 02:00.188
These compounds have accelerated the destruction of the ozone layer,...

02:00.711 --> 02:02.611
...especially in the polar regions.
