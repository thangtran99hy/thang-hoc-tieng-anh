00:03.195 --> 00:05.823
However, it's not all doom and gloom.

00:06.593 --> 00:11.184
In 1987, over 30 countries signed the Montreal Protocol,...

00:11.628 --> 00:17.569
...in which the signatories agreed to cut CFC use by 50 percent by the year 2000.

00:18.617 --> 00:21.614
This protocol was further extended two years later,...

00:22.079 --> 00:27.418
...when over 80 countries agreed to stop using CFCs completely by the year 2000.

00:28.657 --> 00:33.664
Also, in 1991, a fund was set up to help developing countries...

00:33.784 --> 00:38.832
...change over to non-CFC technologies, and it has met with some success.

00:39.729 --> 00:43.672
Hopefully, new technologies will continue to provide safer alternatives...

00:43.815 --> 00:49.049
...to CFCs, HCFCs and other gases that harm the atmosphere.

00:50.318 --> 00:54.745
One current example is the increase in use of coolants in air conditioning units...

00:54.834 --> 00:57.548
...which break down into relatively harmless compounds...

00:57.637 --> 00:59.498
...before they can reach the stratosphere.

01:00.859 --> 01:04.529
However, there is still some use of ozone-depleting gases...

01:04.957 --> 01:07.849
...such as methyl bromide in some pesticides,...

01:08.372 --> 01:13.292
...and some countries who haven't signed the Montreal Protocol are still using CFCs.

01:14.282 --> 01:18.207
Because of this, and because of the long lifespan of the CFCs...

01:18.301 --> 01:20.064
...that are already in the stratosphere,...

01:20.643 --> 01:25.077
...it's estimated that it will take several lifetimes for the ozone layer to recover.
