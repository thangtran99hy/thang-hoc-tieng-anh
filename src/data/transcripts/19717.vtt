The original idea behind MyFC was to see if a large group of football fans...

00:25.936 --> 00:29.195
...could run a football club better than a millionaire, billionaire owner.

00:29.751 --> 00:32.201
And do the Roman Abramovich thing, come in and...

00:32.286 --> 00:36.678
..."Can we, as a collective, run a football club in a better way for the fans?"

00:37.087 --> 00:41.144
The guy who had the idea was a guy called Will Brooks and he was a journalist.

00:41.335 --> 00:45.487
And that is how he sold his vision, that "Can the fans run a football club?"

00:46.099 --> 00:49.810
He got some sponsorship money from Electronic Arts,...

00:50.216 --> 00:51.945
...a video game company and sports company.

00:52.588 --> 00:56.629
And put this idea together and sold it on the Internet,...

00:57.433 --> 00:59.649
...and got interest from 50,000 people,...

00:59.773 --> 01:02.249
...just expressing an interest and they would like to be involved.

01:02.793 --> 01:05.007
And originally 33,000 people signed up...

01:05.495 --> 01:07.948
...and put their money where their mouth was and joined up.

01:08.769 --> 01:13.315
They paid 35 pounds each, with a proportion of that going to running the society...

01:14.070 --> 01:16.504
...and the large bulk of that going straight to the football club.

01:16.967 --> 01:21.803
The club was purchased for around somewhere between one million and 1.5 million pounds,...

01:22.268 --> 01:25.853
...and that pretty much ate up all of the subscription money for that first year.

01:27.119 --> 01:28.847
Members renew on an annual basis.

01:31.611 --> 01:33.021
Most of the money went to buying the club.

01:33.141 --> 01:35.393
We made a lot of improvements in a short space of time,...

01:36.174 --> 01:38.063
...buying new training equipment for the players...

01:38.236 --> 01:40.268
...and sorted out a new kit deal, things like that.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.309
The club went on a fantastic Cup run.

01:43.521 --> 01:45.559
They made it all the way to the Wembley and won the FA Trophy.
