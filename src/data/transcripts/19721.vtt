00:01.393 --> 00:03.963
As our world becomes increasingly complex,...

00:04.211 --> 00:07.881
...rapidly growing cities face unprecedented new challenges.

00:13.164 --> 00:19.223
Rio de Janeiro, while known for its rich culture, active lifestyles, and stunning natural beauty,...

00:19.503 --> 00:24.247
...is also burdened with crime, aging infrastructure, and natural disasters.

00:26.096 --> 00:28.761
Already a burgeoning city of six million,...

00:28.887 --> 00:31.214
...Rio now prepares for millions more...

00:31.516 --> 00:36.889
...as they get ready to host the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.303
Like other forward-thinking cities,...

00:39.665 --> 00:43.249
...Rio realized it was in need of a new city operations plan...

00:43.319 --> 00:47.539
...to improve emergency response coordination, manage increased traffic,...

00:47.613 --> 00:49.469
...and improve services for citizens.

00:51.051 --> 00:54.351
Rio turned to IBM to create a "Smarter City".

00:54.785 --> 00:59.091
...by integrating more than 30 agencies into one centralized command center.

01:01.887 --> 01:06.348
The new Smarter City system gathers data from sectors across city operations...

01:06.411 --> 01:11.783
...making it easy for security officials and crisis managers to monitor and respond to problems quickly.

01:13.735 --> 01:17.776
Data from sensors and video feeds create real-time maps and graphs,...

01:18.117 --> 01:20.785
...working to predict problems and counteract them.

01:21.937 --> 01:26.143
Weather monitoring systems forecast heavy rains with state-of-the-art accuracy,...

01:26.437 --> 01:29.894
...giving city officials the ability to anticipate floods and mudslides,...

01:30.223 --> 01:32.697
...alert the public and send emergency support.

01:34.371 --> 01:38.693
The Smarter City system has improved emergency response time by 30 percent,...

01:38.991 --> 01:40.789
...making Rio a safer city.

01:41.549 --> 01:43.363
The result is a visionary city...

01:43.524 --> 01:47.804
...equipped to react, predict, and plan for current and future events.

01:50.546 --> 01:51.731
But this is just the beginning.

01:52.110 --> 01:58.025
Rio's Smarter City transformation is set to expand the transportation, public works and utilities.

02:03.717 --> 02:07.060
Every city, large or small, has its own unique challenges.

02:07.484 --> 02:10.060
Working with forward-thinking cities like Rio...

02:10.127 --> 02:13.727
...and more than 2,000 other Smarter Cities projects around the world,...

02:14.119 --> 02:17.247
...IBM is able to help make cities smarter.
