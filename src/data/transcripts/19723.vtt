00:00.177 --> 00:02.843
A ten-ton meteor slammed into Russia last night.

00:03.232 --> 00:03.873
How big was it?

00:04.057 --> 00:05.267
How much damage did it cause?

00:05.368 --> 00:07.743
And why was it caught on so many cameras?

00:13.718 --> 00:16.716
I'm Anthony for DNews, and last night, Trace talked about an asteroid...

00:16.821 --> 00:20.144
...that was flying by Earth today, 2012 DA14.

00:20.307 --> 00:24.461
Now, right after we reported on it, a totally different, unrelated meteor...

00:24.730 --> 00:29.397
...hit Chelyabinsk, Russia, causing massive damage and over a thousand injuries.

00:29.492 --> 00:32.006
Now, the meteor was estimated to weigh about ten tons,...

00:32.298 --> 00:34.653
...and it entered the Earth's atmosphere over the Ural Mountains...

00:34.729 --> 00:37.615
...at a speed of 33,000 miles per hour.

00:37.949 --> 00:39.391
That is hypersonic speed.

00:39.587 --> 00:40.846
It was six and a half feet long,...

00:40.947 --> 00:44.229
...but shattered into pieces about 20 to 30 miles above the ground,...

00:44.527 --> 00:46.525
...releasing several kilotons of energy.

00:46.617 --> 00:49.588
Now, that's basically the same amount as a small nuclear bomb.

00:49.963 --> 00:53.279
Just the shockwave from the meteor entering our atmosphere...

00:53.387 --> 00:58.429
...damaged over 3,000 buildings and shattered over a million square feet of glass,...

00:58.575 --> 01:01.285
...and that shattered glass is the cause of most of the injuries in the area.

01:01.417 --> 01:04.845
At the time I'm recording this, anywhere from 900 to 1,200 people,...

01:04.934 --> 01:09.939
...there were conflicting reports, have gone in for medical care for shockwave-related injuries.

01:10.023 --> 01:14.411
Right now, there are no reports of deaths or people actually being hit by space debris.

01:14.539 --> 01:19.454
This is the largest recorded explosion of a space object hitting the Earth since 1908.

01:19.569 --> 01:23.152
Now, that impact was also in Russia, 3,000 miles away from this one...

01:23.218 --> 01:28.443
...in an area called Tunguska and was estimated to be somewhere around ten megatons in force.

01:28.555 --> 01:33.835
Yesterday's meteor's descent was recorded by a large number of dashboard cameras in Russian cars,...

01:33.915 --> 01:37.057
...and the reason for that is that a lot of Russian drivers have them installed...

01:37.461 --> 01:41.187
...because of high instances of insurance fraud and hit-and-run accidents in the country.

01:41.271 --> 01:45.236
So, it may seem coincidental, but it's a very standard practice over there.
