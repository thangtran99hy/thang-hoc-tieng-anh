00:20.957 --> 00:24.578
Roger, Trans Air 275, we are two miles on final for 14.

00:27.776 --> 00:31.394
It's not only aircraft that can wander onto an active runway.

00:32.922 --> 00:35.815
Our Truck 20 leaving garage for Air Eastern hangar.

00:37.644 --> 00:41.029

Hold short of runway 14, traffic on final.

00:46.084 --> 00:46.497
Roger.

00:47.109 --> 00:51.633

Truck 20, that's CHARLIE ECHO.

00:55.532 --> 00:55.917
Roger.

00:58.761 --> 00:59.931
The driver of this truck...

01:00.121 --> 01:03.891
...doesn't understand the directions he's been given by the Flight Service Specialist.

01:04.350 --> 01:07.147
He thinks he'll annoy him by asking for clarification.

01:10.233 --> 01:14.104
The Flight Service Specialist hears the uncertainty in the driver's messages,...

01:14.626 --> 01:16.758
...but he assumes the driver is fully aware...

01:17.036 --> 01:18.733
...he's approaching the active runway,...

01:19.064 --> 01:20.810
...and that there is an aircraft on final.

01:22.557 --> 01:24.324
Preoccupied with finding his way,...

01:24.849 --> 01:28.647
...the vehicle operator rolls through the hold line at runway one-four...

01:31.159 --> 01:32.735
Truck 20, get off the runway.

01:32.882 --> 01:33.223
Now!

01:42.013 --> 01:45.889
This time, the Flight Service Specialist noticed the truck approaching the runway,...

01:47.249 --> 01:50.667
...but it could be a different story at night or in poor visibility.
