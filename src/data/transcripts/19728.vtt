A dog walker curious and daring enough to take home a smelly lump of rock he found on the beach...

00:08.917 --> 00:11.461
...is on the path to becoming a much richer man.

00:11.950 --> 00:16.431
Ken Willman, whose dog discovered a chunk of rare whale vomit on Morecambe Beach...

00:16.774 --> 00:22.341
...was stunned to learn the unimpressive and smelly rock could be worth up to a hundred grand.

00:22.841 --> 00:25.711
So as I'm walking along, she was messing about with this.

00:26.178 --> 00:27.898
I got a bit closer, I thought, "No, it's a big stone."

00:27.972 --> 00:29.345
"Why is she messing with a big stone?"

00:30.755 --> 00:32.708
And then when I picked it up I thought, "That's not a stone."

00:33.333 --> 00:34.769
And then I smelt it, I thought, "Oh!"

00:35.137 --> 00:42.267
And I got home, I put the Internet on and Googled whale vomit, and up comes ambergris.

00:42.509 --> 00:46.534
Ambergris is used to make perfume, and it's extremely rare.

00:46.914 --> 00:50.067
But not many people know that except for perfume experts.

00:50.308 --> 00:53.148
The reason why it becomes so valuable is that it starts off...

00:53.266 --> 01:00.229
...with this sticky, liquid, viscous substance, but then over time, the waves,...

01:00.358 --> 01:04.549
...the sunshine beating down on the sea, the sea salt,...

01:04.919 --> 01:11.608
...these all combine to oxidize the sticky substance into a ball, into a rock.

01:11.946 --> 01:15.317
So if you smell something pungent on a beach in the future,...

01:15.694 --> 01:17.301
...make sure you pick it up.
