I have about 4,000 dollars right there.

00:03.693 --> 00:07.451
Ever heard of someone accidentally finding an object worth thousands of dollars?

00:07.683 --> 00:10.097
Usually, it's either artwork or antiques.

00:10.335 --> 00:11.814
But how about whale vomit?

00:12.707 --> 00:16.695
While at a headland in Dorset, England, a school-age boy, Charlie Naysmith,...

00:17.029 --> 00:21.580
...found a piece of whale vomit that may have a value of 40,000 British pounds.

00:22.326 --> 00:25.553
Whale vomit is high in demand for its use in creating perfumes.

00:25.844 --> 00:29.820
It is rare to see on the shore, as it could remain in the sea for decades.

00:30.633 --> 00:33.535
The young boy is trying to decide what to do with the whale vomit,...

00:34.054 --> 00:38.371
...but if it is sold, he would like to build a home designated for animals with the proceeds.

00:39.192 --> 00:42.355
It is not the first time that a whale vomit discovery made news.

00:42.646 --> 00:46.494
Several years ago, an Australian couple stumbled across a large piece.

00:47.259 --> 00:49.497
The couple initially left the lump on the beach,...

00:49.839 --> 00:52.721
...but weeks later, they saw it again, so they took it home.

00:53.038 --> 01:00.103
The lump, weighing 14.75 kilograms, was estimated to have a value of 295,000 dollars.
