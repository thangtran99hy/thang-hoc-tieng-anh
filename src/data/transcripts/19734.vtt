Is a smart wristwatch really the next frontier for Apple?

00:03.196 --> 00:05.534
The New York Times reported over the weekend that Apple...

00:05.593 --> 00:10.655
...was experimenting with a so-called iWatch, banking on the company's curved glass technology...

00:10.777 --> 00:13.825
...to deliver an iOS operated, wearable mini computer.

00:14.175 --> 00:17.707
Noting the place of such device is in James Bond and comic book lore.

00:17.825 --> 00:21.155
Reports said that advances in easily bendable Willow glass...

00:21.266 --> 00:24.225
...had helped bring the product closer than ever to reality.

00:24.585 --> 00:27.475
A Chinese gadget blog had previously reported on rumors...

00:27.563 --> 00:32.663
...that Apple plans to create a wristwatch computer with Bluetooth and a 1.5-inch display.

00:32.942 --> 00:36.183
The new reports caution that there was no timeline for the watches...

00:36.280 --> 00:39.058
...or even a guarantee they would ever make it to the market.

00:39.397 --> 00:43.081
Google, meanwhile, is forging ahead with computers wearable as glasses,...

00:43.172 --> 00:47.285
...which it hopes to account for three percent of its revenue by 2015.
