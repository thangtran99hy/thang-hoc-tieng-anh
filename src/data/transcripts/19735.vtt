The scene is Washington's Dupont Circle Park: two penguins dance to electronic music.

00:08.635 --> 00:10.839
The people around them don't seem to notice.

00:13.491 --> 00:15.979
Suddenly, the place is filled with dancers.

00:17.817 --> 00:21.843
Flash mobs like this are part of a global wave of YouTube enthusiasts...

00:22.074 --> 00:25.844
...who use the song 'Harlem Shake' by a man who calls himself DJ Baauer...

00:27.083 --> 00:31.667
...to transform seemingly normal occasions into dance-filled chaos.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.458
Thank you so much everybody for coming.

00:34.745 --> 00:38.078
Jordin's Paradise, a dance and fitness studio in Washington,...

00:38.385 --> 00:42.224
...organized the event through Facebook and found eager participants.

00:42.407 --> 00:44.383
I think the song is really catchy,...

00:44.666 --> 00:47.641
...and since 'Gangnam Style' was very difficult for everybody to get,...

00:47.955 --> 00:49.061
...this is really simple.

00:49.167 --> 00:52.668
So, even if you can't even dance, just do whatever, and it's so awesome.

00:52.879 --> 00:56.620
In early February, five Australian teenagers were among the first...

00:56.713 --> 00:58.839
...to post their Harlem Shake video on YouTube,...

00:59.207 --> 01:03.620
...creating the most popular version where the dancers ignored by those around him...

01:05.197 --> 01:06.721
...until everyone joins in.

01:08.650 --> 01:12.245
YouTube says thousands of versions have been uploaded in February,...

01:12.475 --> 01:15.649
...generating more than 175 million views.

01:16.685 --> 01:21.207
The most popular iterations feature a swim and diving team at the University of Georgia,...

01:21.819 --> 01:27.341
...Norwegian army officers, a media company, and a comedian named Filthy Frank.

01:30.445 --> 01:34.605
American rock duo Matt & Kim came up with one widely watched version...

01:34.748 --> 01:36.314
...with the concert hall as their venue...

01:37.568 --> 01:40.695
...and 5,000 fans as their backup dancers.

01:42.905 --> 01:47.975
Cynics say the flood of Harlem Shake imitations means people will eventually tire of it.

01:48.843 --> 01:51.401
Vocalist Matt Johnson told VOA via Skype,...

01:51.770 --> 01:54.350
...he is surprised the craze has lasted this long.

01:54.521 --> 01:57.615
And, but that's the thing, the nature of these Internet memes...

01:57.709 --> 02:01.064
...is that they can be so large so quickly.

02:01.460 --> 02:03.179
It's not like you can maintain it.

02:03.588 --> 02:05.962
Everything is about doing it right then and moving forward.

02:06.151 --> 02:10.033
Rania Jaziri of Jordin's Paradise hopes the fad will endure.

02:10.456 --> 02:11.791
People need an outlet.

02:11.903 --> 02:15.867
People need to be able to just dance and not care about any choreography...

02:15.975 --> 02:18.494
...and just have fun and come together.

02:19.203 --> 02:23.850
These dancers in Washington have shown that it's not too late to join the Harlem Shake fun,...

02:24.303 --> 02:26.880
...as they prepare to share their creation on the Internet...

02:27.347 --> 02:29.465
...in hope of achieving some YouTube glory.

02:30.176 --> 02:32.361
