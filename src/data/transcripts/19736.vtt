00:01.336 --> 00:04.485
I went around the world for five weeks with just one razor.

00:05.104 --> 00:07.355
Every day, I got ready to start something new.

00:08.465 --> 00:09.667
This one taught me respect.

00:12.353 --> 00:15.167
It's amazing and you can just tell like he's his master.

00:15.291 --> 00:17.878
He just gives off this presence about him...

00:17.947 --> 00:19.420
...that you really get to sense that...

00:20.159 --> 00:21.192
...he knows what he's doing...

00:21.271 --> 00:23.527
...and he takes what he's doing extremely serious.

00:26.429 --> 00:30.339
I try not to expect anything, like, going into a situation like this.

00:30.617 --> 00:35.108
I just try and gain a little perspective as to who he is...

00:35.175 --> 00:36.881
...and why he does the things he does...

00:36.945 --> 00:39.282
...and maybe learn something from that.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.635
It's a very strict process,...

00:44.319 --> 00:47.059
...him saying that it takes him about one month to complete a sword...

00:47.178 --> 00:49.315
...which is unbelievable.

00:49.401 --> 00:52.635
I mean, it's truly a craft; you start hitting it...

00:53.347 --> 00:58.193
...and the smallest missed hit and it throws the entire shape off.

00:58.488 --> 01:01.211
He had younger guys who were studying under him.

01:01.757 --> 01:03.457
All these people work diligently...

01:03.965 --> 01:06.380
...day in and day out for months to make that sword.

01:07.081 --> 01:10.261
We kind of feel like that's a dying thing.

01:10.747 --> 01:12.500
It's just so easy to go out and buy things,...

01:12.611 --> 01:14.847
...and that there's something to be said about...

01:15.140 --> 01:18.873
...working with your hands and going out and building something.

01:19.661 --> 01:23.186
And when it's all finished, standing back and looking at it,...

01:23.751 --> 01:26.586
...and be like, "Wow, I did that!"
