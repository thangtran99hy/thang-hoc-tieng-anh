00:03.485 --> 00:05.817
Barbie has gone binary.

00:06.779 --> 00:11.095
Mattel has transformed the world's most famous plastic person...

00:11.813 --> 00:13.313
...into a digital doll...

00:13.397 --> 00:16.982
...with the addition of a computer-enhanced version of its best-selling toy.

00:17.591 --> 00:21.163
Introduced at this year's Toy Fair Convention in New York City,...

00:21.639 --> 00:26.337
...the teched out and decked out darling dubbed the "Barbie Digital Dress Doll".

00:26.594 --> 00:32.482
...is rocking new threads, featuring a touch panel with 114 tricolored LEDs.

00:33.273 --> 00:36.194
A pre-programmed light show of designs and shapes...

00:36.487 --> 00:38.342
...can be displayed on the front of the dress,...

00:38.691 --> 00:41.767
...and its flashing activity can even respond to music.

00:42.267 --> 00:46.773
And if that isn't enough to make you want to drop 50 bucks for a bedazzled Barbie,...

00:47.223 --> 00:50.037
...you can use a stylist to channel your inner Chanel...

00:50.121 --> 00:52.547
...by drawing your own custom designs.

00:53.104 --> 00:55.457
But wait, there's more!

00:55.990 --> 00:59.073
Mattel also showed off the Barbie Digital Makeover Mirror,...

00:59.380 --> 01:03.147
...a kid-sized accessory that incorporates dad's iPad...

01:03.420 --> 01:05.282
...and facial tracking technology,...

01:05.568 --> 01:09.369
...allowing its fashion-forward user to apply virtual makeup.

01:10.263 --> 01:11.250
What's next?

01:11.667 --> 01:12.827
Barbie Borg?

01:13.669 --> 01:16.561
Resistance will be fashionably futile.
