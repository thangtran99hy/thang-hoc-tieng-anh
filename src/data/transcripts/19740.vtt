Organizing a computer desktop is really important...

00:12.509 --> 00:15.315
...and becoming a growing need for most business owners...

00:15.653 --> 00:18.145
...who are doing more and more work on the computer.

00:18.743 --> 00:22.006
The first tip I have for you is don't overcrowd your desktop.

00:22.571 --> 00:26.295
The more icons and shortcuts you have right in front of you,...

00:26.393 --> 00:29.583
...it's going to be harder to find what you need quickly and easily.

00:30.029 --> 00:34.440
The next thing to do is to create shortcuts and folders for frequently used items.

00:34.785 --> 00:38.209
This will help keep you organized and get you to where you need to be quicker.

00:38.621 --> 00:44.047
Third, use a similar filing system for your physical and your electronic files.

00:44.374 --> 00:46.713
Most people are not 100% paperless,...

00:46.788 --> 00:50.370
...so you are probably gonna have a filing system somewhere in your office.

00:50.927 --> 00:54.293
If your electronic system and your physical system mirror each other...

00:54.605 --> 00:58.099
...it will be a lot easier for you to find things offline and on.

00:58.603 --> 01:01.208
Last, do a periodic desktop cleanup.

01:01.671 --> 01:06.963
It can be really easy to add shortcuts, icons and folders to your desktop...

01:07.373 --> 01:10.753
...and you'll end up with the overcrowding problem that we talked about a little earlier.

01:11.187 --> 01:16.360
So every month or six months, depending on the speed at which you add things to your computer,...

01:16.870 --> 01:19.790
...do a periodic cleanup, throw things away,...

01:20.063 --> 01:23.390
...do a little reorganizing to keep things fresh and organized.

01:23.969 --> 01:27.327
We all know that having an organized desktop and workspace...

01:27.624 --> 01:29.458
...is really important as a business owner.

01:29.810 --> 01:32.069
So your virtual desktop should be no exception.
