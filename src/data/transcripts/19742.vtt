The desk is the main hub of any workspace,...

00:13.546 --> 00:16.039
...so the key thing to do before organizing your desk...

00:16.108 --> 00:20.165
...is to figure out what the main purpose is of that micro workspace...

00:20.245 --> 00:22.423
...that you're gonna be sitting at for most of your day.

00:23.136 --> 00:25.438
What are the main activities you're gonna be doing,...

00:25.519 --> 00:27.432
...and what are you gonna need close at hand?

00:28.050 --> 00:30.424
The next thing to do is start with a clean slate.

00:30.662 --> 00:34.502
Clear off your desktop, clear out any drawers, anything around the desk.

00:34.897 --> 00:37.505
Start with a clean slate and build up from there.

00:38.373 --> 00:42.410
The next thing to do is keep frequently used items close at hand.

00:42.520 --> 00:48.642
Whether that's an inbox, an outbox, action files, a stapler, a pen,...

00:49.023 --> 00:51.918
...whatever you're gonna need on a day-to-day basis.

00:52.816 --> 00:55.983
Next, file anything unnecessary out of sight.

00:56.313 --> 00:59.480
If you don't need them on a daily or a regular basis,...

00:59.799 --> 01:01.985
...you don't need it within arm's reach.

01:02.261 --> 01:05.755
Keep that space free and clear so you can get in and out easily...

01:05.841 --> 01:08.812
...and do your job without any extra stress or headaches.

01:09.713 --> 01:13.540
Lastly, preserve your desk as a work-only space.

01:14.189 --> 01:17.645
It's really important that the things on and around your desk...

01:17.969 --> 01:22.141
...are all there to help you get your job done and be efficient and effective.

01:22.977 --> 01:24.392
If you keep these tips in mind,...

01:24.467 --> 01:29.027
...you'll be able to keep your desk and your workspace as a whole, more organized,...

01:29.101 --> 01:32.099
...and you'll be able to have a much more productive work experience.
