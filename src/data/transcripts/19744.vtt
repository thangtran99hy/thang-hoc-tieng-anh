00:08.602 --> 00:12.691
Most people agree that this is the ugliest mammal in Africa.

00:14.083 --> 00:17.413
Warthog mothers and their piglets often visit mudholes.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.526
They're one of the only pigs active during the day,...

00:20.748 --> 00:24.895
...so like the rhino, they need to protect their skin from the fierce sun.

00:29.468 --> 00:33.846
And protection is part of the reason for that strange, disproportionate head.

00:36.098 --> 00:40.166
It's rock-hard, a helmet that even a leopard's teeth can't penetrate.

00:41.486 --> 00:43.295
But it has other uses, too.

00:44.303 --> 00:46.831
The warthog's muzzle is shaped like a shovel...

00:46.937 --> 00:50.587
...so it can turn over hard earth for tasty bulbs and roots,...

00:51.629 --> 00:55.769
...but they often have to get down on their knees to support that heavy armored head.

01:00.013 --> 01:01.966
No one would call warthogs handsome,...

01:02.379 --> 01:05.925
...but to add injury to insult, this one's lost an eye,...

01:06.437 --> 01:08.505
...probably escaping from a hungry lion.

01:11.869 --> 01:14.209
Fortunately, warthogs are well-armed.

01:15.038 --> 01:17.110
These tusks are formidable weapons.

01:17.616 --> 01:21.289
The biggest ones ever seen were two feet long on the outside edge.

01:24.463 --> 01:27.493
But it's the smaller, lower tusks that are the danger.

01:28.569 --> 01:35.413
They can be very sharp, and they're the main weapon in attack.

01:44.107 --> 01:46.951
And what about the warts that give these pigs their name?

01:48.380 --> 01:49.573
Males have four.

01:49.735 --> 01:50.651
Females, two.

01:51.292 --> 01:55.499
They're not really warts, but protective pads of cartilage and gristle.

01:59.401 --> 02:04.139
In battle, the strategically placed pads deflect thrusting tusks...

02:04.233 --> 02:06.330
...away from soft parts of the face,...

02:06.764 --> 02:08.391
...shielding the eyes and mouth.

02:34.320 --> 02:38.490
For warthogs, an ugly snout can literally be a lifesaver.
