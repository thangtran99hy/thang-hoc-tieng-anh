00:01.243 --> 00:04.293
Beijing's smoggy days are literally off the charts...

00:04.659 --> 00:08.869
...with small airborne particles that reduce visibility and threaten health.

00:09.209 --> 00:11.955
It has been a persistent concern in recent years,...

00:12.234 --> 00:16.910
...but spiking pollution levels in January are sparking a public outcry.

00:17.276 --> 00:19.825
Emissions from coal-fired electricity plants...

00:19.967 --> 00:23.878
...and busy factories are part of the problem that officials hope to reign in...

00:24.108 --> 00:26.133
...through carbon trading platforms.

00:26.541 --> 00:30.321
Seven cities are expected to open carbon markets later this year,...

00:30.595 --> 00:31.793
...including Tianjin.

00:32.223 --> 00:35.886
David Tang is secretary of the board of the Tianjin Carbon Exchange.

00:36.117 --> 00:39.674
...And their government has decided to start with pilots...

00:40.051 --> 00:42.753
...because carbon trading is something new to China,...

00:43.039 --> 00:45.295
...so we want to have a number of pilots...

00:45.619 --> 00:47.379
...to explore the use of the market,...

00:47.708 --> 00:50.173
...and then on the basis of the experience gained...

00:50.452 --> 00:52.848
...create a national market for this instrument.

00:53.217 --> 00:57.374
China wants to launch a national carbon trading program by 2016.

00:57.839 --> 01:02.350
If it's successful, analysts say the program would be one of the largest in the world....

01:02.617 --> 01:06.537
...and help the country meet its target of cutting carbon dioxide emissions...

01:06.778 --> 01:09.665
...by 45 percent within seven years.

01:10.167 --> 01:12.533
The platforms allow companies to earn credits...

01:12.614 --> 01:16.370
...for lowering greenhouse gas emissions, which can then be traded.

01:16.768 --> 01:19.419
If it works, it would encourage for-profit businesses...

01:19.725 --> 01:21.663
...to invest in green technology.

01:22.053 --> 01:24.701
Kevin Tu is a China climate analyst.

01:24.925 --> 01:32.684
They probably need to work to replace coal use by other types of energy carriers...

01:32.879 --> 01:36.302
...such as nuclear, hydro, natural gas,...

01:36.521 --> 01:38.053
...and in the longer future,...

01:38.343 --> 01:42.721
...renewable should be the way for the country to move forward in energy development.

01:43.485 --> 01:46.256
Although carbon trading in the country's booming economy...

01:46.490 --> 01:49.679
...could be a windfall for the still struggling global emissions markets,...

01:50.092 --> 01:53.583
...critics say government intervention, state ownership of companies,...

01:53.811 --> 01:57.788
...and lack of transparency pose big hurdles to its success.

01:58.602 --> 02:02.271
As public concern builds pressure for the government to find a solution,...

02:02.665 --> 02:05.656
...Wu Changhua, Greater China Director of The Climate Group,...

02:05.913 --> 02:07.738
...says there is a broad shift under way...

02:07.825 --> 02:10.270
...in how Chinese weigh their quality of life.

02:10.391 --> 02:14.259
The public basically started to realize actually it's not jobs,...

02:14.507 --> 02:18.819
...and I want to have a better environment quality there as well.

02:19.183 --> 02:23.205
China has long put economic growth ahead of environmental concerns,...

02:23.511 --> 02:25.732
...making it the world's biggest polluter.

02:26.166 --> 02:28.854
Carbon trading supporters hope that the markets...

02:29.076 --> 02:32.815
...could be one way to curb pollution and keep the economy growing.
