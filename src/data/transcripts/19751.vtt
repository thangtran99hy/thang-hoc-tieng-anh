My fellow Americans,...

00:04.168 --> 00:07.325
...I seek to look beyond the doors of the White House...

00:07.719 --> 00:12.361
...into the hopes and fears of men and women in their homes.

00:14.662 --> 00:18.893
Our capacity is limited only by our ability to work together.

00:20.717 --> 00:23.265
I am determined to do my share.

00:25.048 --> 00:28.312
Now, it is your turn.
