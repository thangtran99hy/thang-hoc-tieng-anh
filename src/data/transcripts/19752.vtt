00:00.842 --> 00:04.842
So your company has been losing customers and you don't know what else to do.

00:04.974 --> 00:07.871
You've bombarded your customers with a zillion messages:...

00:08.027 --> 00:12.765
...e-mails, postcards, daily deals, Tweets, Facebook messages, text messages.

00:12.952 --> 00:17.469
Unfortunately, these generic and inefficient messages just didn't deliver as promised.

00:17.632 --> 00:21.277
So you invest thousands of dollars in dashboard reports to find...

00:21.551 --> 00:23.261
...actionable insights...

00:23.349 --> 00:25.225
...to understand why customers are leaving.

00:25.688 --> 00:27.789
You're looking at more and more charts every day.

00:27.997 --> 00:29.955
Charts by region, country and customer.

00:30.102 --> 00:30.621
Pie charts.

00:30.753 --> 00:31.324
Bar charts.

00:31.387 --> 00:32.027
Line charts.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.297
Charts you've never seen before.

00:33.490 --> 00:34.644
They look pretty, all right,...

00:34.897 --> 00:38.147
...but having data at your fingertips does not guarantee success.

00:38.340 --> 00:41.079
Finding ways to keep customers coming back to your store...

00:41.305 --> 00:43.122
...is like finding a needle in a haystack.

00:43.333 --> 00:45.958
And it might cost you 787 clicks.

00:46.127 --> 00:47.936
And once that needle is found...

00:48.079 --> 00:49.849
...the customer is long gone.

00:50.223 --> 00:53.583
So, what's the best way to bring customers back to your store?

00:55.135 --> 00:55.829
Mineful.

00:56.735 --> 01:01.238
Mineful integrates with your e-commerce or CRM data and uses statistics...

01:01.310 --> 01:05.253
...to look at your customers' behavior and predict which customers are at risk.

01:05.353 --> 01:07.994
Then it gives you a list of customers you need to get in touch with...

01:08.131 --> 01:10.367
...along with tools to easily communicate with them.

01:10.634 --> 01:11.326
Take this guy.

01:11.514 --> 01:13.843
He runs a business and uses Mineful to connect...

01:13.950 --> 01:15.685
...with his customers when they need him the most.

01:15.886 --> 01:17.191
Now he knows that Mary,...

01:17.290 --> 01:20.395
...who used to purchase 5,000 dollars worth of goods, is off track.

01:20.603 --> 01:24.995
He calls Mary, offers her a discount on a new product and Mary happily purchases.

01:25.196 --> 01:28.871
So we know, we know, you really love your pretty charts.

01:29.096 --> 01:31.291
But really now, isn't it time to take action?

01:31.690 --> 01:35.722
