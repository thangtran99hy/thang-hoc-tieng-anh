Hi, welcome to WatchMojo.

00:02.919 --> 00:05.325
I'm Ashley and today is International Women's Day.

00:05.683 --> 00:07.673
Observed since the 1900s,...

00:07.740 --> 00:12.340
...tradition sees that men honor their wives, mothers, girlfriends, colleagues, etc...

00:12.386 --> 00:14.058
...with flowers and small gifts.

00:14.263 --> 00:17.852
In some countries, International Women's Day has the same status as Mother's Day,...

00:17.926 --> 00:20.250
...where children give small gifts to their mothers and grandmothers.

00:21.332 --> 00:25.128
The new millennium has witnessed a significant change and shift in attitude...

00:25.160 --> 00:29.069
...in both women's and society's thoughts about women's equality and liberation.

00:29.319 --> 00:33.137
Many from the younger generation feel that all the battles had been won for women,...

00:33.270 --> 00:36.472
...while many feminists from the 1970s know only too well...

00:36.514 --> 00:39.246
...the endurance and ingrained complexity of patriarchy.

00:39.402 --> 00:41.067
With more women in the boardroom,...

00:41.200 --> 00:43.444
...greater equality in legislative rights...

00:43.601 --> 00:46.579
...and an increased critical mass of women's visibility...

00:46.662 --> 00:49.454
...as impressive role models in every aspect of life,...

00:49.674 --> 00:52.406
...one could think that women have gained true equality.

00:52.587 --> 00:55.505
The unfortunate fact is that women are so not paid equally...

00:55.545 --> 00:57.055
...to that of their male counterparts.

00:57.319 --> 01:00.872
Women still are not present in equal numbers in business or politics.

01:01.383 --> 01:04.673
And globally, women's education, health and the violence against them...

01:04.773 --> 01:06.143
...is worse than that of men.

01:06.303 --> 01:08.217
Great improvements have been made, however.

01:08.390 --> 01:10.863
We do have female astronauts and prime ministers.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.007
Schoolgirls are welcomed into university,...

01:13.129 --> 01:14.651
...women can work and have a family.

01:14.789 --> 01:16.129
Women have real choices.

01:16.207 --> 01:20.540
And so the tone and nature of International Women's Day has, for the past few years,...

01:20.621 --> 01:22.730
...moved from being a reminder about the negatives...

01:22.856 --> 01:24.584
...to a celebration of the positives.

01:24.636 --> 01:27.586
Annually on March 8th, thousands of events are held throughout the world...

01:27.739 --> 01:29.766
...to inspire women and celebrate their achievements.

01:29.838 --> 01:32.982
Ranging from business conferences, political rallies, government activities,...

01:33.113 --> 01:35.634
...and networking events through the local women's craft markets,...

01:35.697 --> 01:37.977
...theatrical performances, fashion parades and more.

01:38.161 --> 01:40.909
So to make a difference, think globally and act locally.

01:41.157 --> 01:43.563
Make every day International Women's Day,...

01:43.693 --> 01:47.789
...and do your bit to ensure that the future for women is bright, equal, safe and rewarding.
