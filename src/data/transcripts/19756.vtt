I'm a professional organizer.

00:02.308 --> 00:07.026
When I work with clients, I often say what I'm selling is time.

00:07.642 --> 00:10.237
In your home, everything has a place.

00:10.459 --> 00:14.195
And if it doesn't have a place, is it because, maybe it doesn't belong there.

00:14.500 --> 00:15.114
Maybe you don't need it.

00:15.627 --> 00:18.351
And I think it's important to really see what you have.

00:18.633 --> 00:20.147
I think it's important to go through your stuff.

00:20.459 --> 00:22.951
If everything's got a place, then it's easier to find them.

00:23.300 --> 00:25.135
You're not spending a lot of time looking for stuff.
