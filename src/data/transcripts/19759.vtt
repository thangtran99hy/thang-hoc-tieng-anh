00:05.696 --> 00:06.459
Come in closer.

00:07.616 --> 00:09.320
Because the more you think you see,...

00:13.047 --> 00:14.879
...the easier it will be to fool you.

00:16.365 --> 00:17.153
Ladies and gentlemen!

00:17.260 --> 00:18.345
For our final trick...

00:18.460 --> 00:19.567
We are going to rob a bank.

00:20.684 --> 00:24.635
On the count of three you will be teleported through space and time...

00:24.789 --> 00:26.187
...to your bank in Paris.

00:26.378 --> 00:26.773
One,..

00:26.995 --> 00:27.343
...two,...

00:27.579 --> 00:27.809
...three.

00:29.470 --> 00:32.133
Everyone in this room was a victim of hard times.

00:32.218 --> 00:34.237
Some of you lost your home, your car...

00:34.385 --> 00:34.907
And so tonight,...

00:35.097 --> 00:37.307
We're gonna return some of that money back to you.

00:40.453 --> 00:41.196
Thank you, everyone.

00:41.385 --> 00:42.121
Good night!

00:44.655 --> 00:45.083
Freeze!

00:45.378 --> 00:46.230
Hands where I can see them.

00:46.895 --> 00:50.871
Can you explain to me how you went from Las Vegas to Paris in three seconds?

00:51.062 --> 00:52.343
What do the kids call it these days?

00:52.541 --> 00:53.031
Oh, magic.

00:53.134 --> 00:54.445
I'm gonna nail your ass.

00:55.899 --> 00:56.781
First rule of magic:...

00:56.983 --> 00:58.237
...always be the smartest guy in the room.

01:00.053 --> 01:01.723
Your bank was the distraction.

01:03.499 --> 01:05.051
Now they set up the real trick.

01:06.401 --> 01:08.515
Expose them now and destroy them.

01:11.021 --> 01:11.913
Hang on, hang on.

01:12.736 --> 01:13.504
I've got nothing.

01:13.722 --> 01:14.256
Okay, thank you.

01:14.617 --> 01:15.391
Thank you for the delay.

01:18.234 --> 01:19.841
Whatever this grand trick is,...

01:20.474 --> 01:22.543
...it was designed a long time ago.

01:24.497 --> 01:26.506
And I believe that what's about to follow...

01:29.225 --> 01:30.869
...is really going to amaze.

01:35.377 --> 01:39.086
Look closely, because the closer you think you are,...

01:39.817 --> 01:41.621
...the less you'll actually see.
