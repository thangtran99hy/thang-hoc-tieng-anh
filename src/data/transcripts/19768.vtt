The European Graduate Programme lasts for 24 months,...

00:17.987 --> 00:21.187
...so as a graduate you would join on the 1st of September,...

00:21.808 --> 00:25.427
...and you would do your first assignment for 12 months in one part of the business.

00:26.241 --> 00:29.838

00:30.247 --> 00:31.379
...in a different part of the business,...

00:31.472 --> 00:33.187
...and more than likely in a different country as well.

00:33.494 --> 00:35.337
