I'm about to introduce you to one of the grossest creatures on Earth.

00:17.507 --> 00:21.255
It's the tongue-eating isopod, Cymothoa exigua.

00:22.172 --> 00:25.311
Isopods are crustaceans like lobsters and crabs.

00:25.883 --> 00:29.855
This particular isopod happens to live in the ocean and is a parasite.

00:30.570 --> 00:34.507
It's a sort of marine louse, only it's way creepier.

00:34.622 --> 00:34.953
Hey!

00:35.769 --> 00:38.248
Anyway, the first crazy thing to know about these guys...

00:38.352 --> 00:42.063
...is that they're what's called protoandritic hermaphrodites.

00:42.575 --> 00:46.557
That means that when they're adults, the males can become females.

00:47.161 --> 00:48.660
These isopods infest fish.

00:48.973 --> 00:53.017
So, what happens is that a number of juveniles enter through the fish's gills...

00:53.306 --> 00:55.271
...and all mature into males.

00:55.849 --> 01:01.746
Then, one of the isopods will become a female, and that's when things get really freaky.

01:02.370 --> 01:04.545
The female will crawl into the fish's mouth...

01:04.731 --> 01:08.791
...and attach herself to the base of the fish's tongue using her back legs.

01:09.336 --> 01:13.762
Then, she'll suck blood from the tongue until it withers and dies.

01:14.287 --> 01:18.431
This procedure is quite unpleasant for the fish, but it doesn't kill it.

01:19.076 --> 01:23.313
In fact, it starts using the parasite like a prosthetic tongue.

01:24.117 --> 01:27.379
Meanwhile, the isopod just continues to hang out in the fish's mouth,...

01:27.933 --> 01:30.613
...sucking its blood or feeding on fish mucus.

01:30.675 --> 01:31.451
Mucus!

01:31.859 --> 01:34.107
We don't know a ton about the parasite's life cycle,...

01:34.529 --> 01:38.597
...but based on other mouth-infesting isopods, and yes, there are others,...

01:39.106 --> 01:41.473
...the female may even mate while in the fish's mouth...

01:41.682 --> 01:44.854
...with male isopods living in the fish's gill chamber.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.155
I know this doesn't sound real,...

01:47.448 --> 01:51.188
...so here's a photograph of a mouth-infesting isopod to prove it.

01:56.351 --> 01:58.886
Thankfully, these guys don't infest humans,...

01:59.160 --> 02:00.930
...but they do infest fish that we eat.

02:01.671 --> 02:04.330
Cymothoa exigua has a preference for snapper,...

02:04.703 --> 02:08.685
...and other mouth-infesting isopods prey upon mahi-mahi or barramundi.

02:09.461 --> 02:11.303
So, the next time you're at the grocery store,...

02:11.598 --> 02:13.500
...take a look inside that red snapper's mouth.

02:14.284 --> 02:16.182
You might find a tasty treat inside.
