00:04.034 --> 00:05.106
I am a princess.

00:06.798 --> 00:08.127
I am brave sometimes.

00:09.983 --> 00:11.537
I am scared sometimes.

00:14.091 --> 00:18.001
Sometimes, I am brave even when I am scared.

00:21.243 --> 00:24.429
I believe in loyalty and trust.

00:25.947 --> 00:28.250
I believe loyalty is built on trust.

00:29.169 --> 00:30.337
I try to be kind.

00:30.915 --> 00:32.207
I try to be generous.

00:32.685 --> 00:35.557
I am kind even when others are not so generous.

00:37.562 --> 00:38.867
I am a princess.

00:42.258 --> 00:44.433
I think standing up for myself is important.

00:45.407 --> 00:47.781
I think standing up for others is more important.

00:48.491 --> 00:51.278
But standing with others is most important.

00:58.045 --> 00:59.599
I am a princess.

01:00.377 --> 01:02.511
I believe compassion makes me strong.

01:04.451 --> 01:05.836
Kindness is power.

01:08.807 --> 01:12.284
And family is the tightest bond of all.

01:17.705 --> 01:18.956
I have heard I am beautiful.

01:21.488 --> 01:22.524
I know I am strong.

01:23.420 --> 01:24.508
I promise.

01:25.047 --> 01:29.792
And when I promise something, I never ever break that promise.

01:36.077 --> 01:37.549
I am a princess.

01:40.149 --> 01:41.620
Long may I reign.
