You think I would be bothered by this, but I'm not.

00:09.238 --> 00:11.530
Toshiba's product team tests the Satellite Ultrabook...

00:11.621 --> 00:14.515
...to withstand a four-kilovolt electrostatic discharge.

00:14.901 --> 00:17.507
Let's see what happens when we kick it up a notch or seven.

00:19.081 --> 00:19.829
Let loose!

00:20.080 --> 00:21.295
Let loose!

00:21.427 --> 00:23.107
Nope, like, put it on the computer.

00:23.220 --> 00:25.065
Put it on the computer!

00:25.201 --> 00:27.192
You can't just repeat what I'm saying, Matt.

00:27.287 --> 00:28.969
You got to do the test, man.

00:31.788 --> 00:34.100
Begin field test.

00:50.152 --> 00:50.681
Take them off.

00:52.639 --> 00:53.344
There you go.

00:57.970 --> 01:00.491
Looking good and looking good.
