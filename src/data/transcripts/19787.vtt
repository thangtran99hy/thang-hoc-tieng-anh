At Honda, we know some people are never happy with the way things are,...

00:09.098 --> 00:11.165
...and are always dreaming of the way they could be.

00:15.004 --> 00:15.447
Smarter.

00:17.389 --> 00:17.949
Faster.

00:19.225 --> 00:19.711
Simpler.

00:20.822 --> 00:21.086
Better.

00:22.481 --> 00:23.649
What if it had a thing for that,...

00:25.389 --> 00:26.599
...and a that for this?

00:27.237 --> 00:29.125
Or could do what this one doesn't...

00:30.279 --> 00:31.309
...and they make it that way.

00:32.224 --> 00:33.660
Because while the old one was good,...

00:34.183 --> 00:35.905
...things can always be better.

00:37.085 --> 00:38.013
We like those people.

00:38.965 --> 00:39.811
They think like us.

00:41.067 --> 00:43.451
Introducing the best Honda Civic yet.

00:44.484 --> 00:45.937
The redesigned Civic Hybrid,...

00:48.557 --> 00:49.483
...Civic sedan...

00:51.835 --> 00:52.862
...and Civic SI.

00:57.157 --> 00:59.566
Made possible by Honda.
