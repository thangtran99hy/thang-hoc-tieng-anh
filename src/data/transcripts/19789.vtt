Companies across the world talk about employee relations,...

00:07.435 --> 00:10.295
...and they talk about employees are their most important product.

00:10.732 --> 00:12.043
Most of it is hogwash.

00:13.177 --> 00:20.219
But most of them don't really believe in training, in building teams and investing in people.

00:20.872 --> 00:23.879
Investing in people is the whole ball game.

00:24.417 --> 00:28.599
When you invest in people and when you give them your trust,...

00:28.751 --> 00:34.220
...and they give you their trust, and you both drive towards a common vision...,

00:34.715 --> 00:37.044
...and you explain to them what's in it for them,...

00:37.847 --> 00:40.779
...not just where you're going, where you're going, yes,...

00:41.070 --> 00:42.862
...but what's in it for them to go there.

00:43.682 --> 00:46.775
You build great teams with great results.

00:47.291 --> 00:48.687
And that's what this is all about.

00:48.779 --> 00:50.002
And people don't get that.

00:50.407 --> 00:53.994
People don't understand that you've got to invest in training.

00:54.579 --> 00:58.239
You've got to invest, you've got to get the culture that's common,...

00:58.584 --> 01:00.179
...the values that are common,...

01:00.481 --> 01:03.540
...so that people know where they're going and why they're going there.
