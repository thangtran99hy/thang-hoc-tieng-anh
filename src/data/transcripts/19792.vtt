Hugo Chavez took office as Venezuela's president in 1999,...

00:09.961 --> 00:14.044
...hailed by the country's poor, who believed that he championed their interests.

00:16.518 --> 00:19.661
But he had burst on the world political scene years earlier,...

00:20.053 --> 00:24.346
...when in 1992, as an army paratrooper, he led a failed coup attempt...

00:24.515 --> 00:25.682
...for which he was jailed.

00:26.289 --> 00:30.899
When released, he pursued power legitimately, forming a political movement,...

00:31.218 --> 00:33.992
...running for president and winning in 1998.

00:34.921 --> 00:38.341
I swear before my people on this moribund constitution...

00:38.707 --> 00:41.361
...that I will work to make the democratic transformation.

00:42.841 --> 00:46.605
But experts say Venezuela became increasingly undemocratic...

00:46.711 --> 00:49.801
...under President Chavez's growing authoritarian rule.

00:53.609 --> 00:55.803
We rediscovered the needs of the poor classes.

00:56.266 --> 00:59.272
We rediscovered that it was necessary to tend to their problems.

01:03.630 --> 01:04.626
What are the negatives?

01:04.881 --> 01:06.791
Well, I think the most important of all is that...

01:06.949 --> 01:10.019
...Venezuela's democracy nowadays is quite a poor democracy.

01:14.655 --> 01:17.045
He used election and referendum victories...

01:17.129 --> 01:19.810
...to increase his power and abolish term limits.

01:20.341 --> 01:26.034
In 2012, Mr. Chavez won a fourth term as president with 54 percent of the vote,...

01:26.437 --> 01:30.219
...which he considered a mandate to continue his socialist policies.

01:34.789 --> 01:37.959
The country voted for the continuation of a political agenda...

01:39.073 --> 01:44.813
...and economic agenda, the social agenda; in short, a socialist agenda.

01:46.937 --> 01:50.491
Abroad, Hugo Chavez became an irritant to the United States...

01:50.593 --> 01:52.130
...with his constant criticism.

01:52.598 --> 01:55.884
In 2006, he gave a speech at the United Nations...

01:55.943 --> 01:59.779
...in which he referred to then President George W. Bush as the devil.

02:03.608 --> 02:06.205
Yesterday, the devil was here at this very spot.

02:06.803 --> 02:11.098
This podium, where it is now my turn to speak, still smells of sulfur.

02:11.559 --> 02:15.745
Mr. Chavez teamed up with other leaders antagonistic to the United States,...

02:16.133 --> 02:21.223
...including Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Cuban leader Fidel Castro,...

02:21.689 --> 02:24.045
...and then Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.

02:24.549 --> 02:28.707
Michael Shifter is an analyst with the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington.

02:29.171 --> 02:33.507
He says the president's socialist policies hurt long-term economic development...

02:33.901 --> 02:37.391
...and contributed to the rising rate of violent crime in the country.

02:37.904 --> 02:39.417
But to his supporters he says,...

02:39.813 --> 02:42.957
...Hugo Chavez will be remembered as a champion of the people,...

02:43.414 --> 02:45.452
...who used the country's vast oil wealth...

02:45.619 --> 02:48.297
...to provide the poor with free housing and healthcare.

02:48.589 --> 02:50.853
There's nobody around who has the charisma...

02:50.953 --> 02:54.527
...and the ability to connect with Venezuelans like Chavez did.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.921
Chavez is a figure and the memory of Chavez won't disappear.

02:58.305 --> 03:00.742
That will help sustain the movement.

03:05.273 --> 03:08.236
Even President Chavez's most ardent detractors say...

03:08.307 --> 03:11.683
...he was extremely charismatic, a master communicator.

03:12.384 --> 03:15.141
He was diagnosed with cancer in June 2011...

03:15.577 --> 03:19.561
...and underwent chemotherapy and a series of other treatments and surgeries.

03:20.205 --> 03:25.758
But he displayed vitality during his 2012 campaign, insisting that he was fine.
