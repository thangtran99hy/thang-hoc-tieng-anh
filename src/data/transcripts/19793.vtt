Hi, I am Naomi and I am very excited to show you...

00:06.100 --> 00:08.305
...the world's greatest attractions.

00:12.109 --> 00:18.280
Imagine an army over 8,000 strong, built by men for conquest after death.

00:19.977 --> 00:23.877
That is what you will see if you travel to visit the Terracotta Army.

00:25.887 --> 00:29.494
This enormous force rests in hundreds of ranks,...

00:29.572 --> 00:31.703
...no two soldiers exactly the same.

00:33.543 --> 00:38.252
Besides the infantry, the army consists of hundreds of cavalry and chariots.

00:39.880 --> 00:42.507
The first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang,...

00:42.673 --> 00:45.700
...ordained its construction in roughly 210 B.C.

00:46.719 --> 00:49.467
The Terracotta Army was supposed to continue...

00:49.541 --> 00:51.696
...the Emperor's conquest in the afterlife.

00:52.973 --> 00:56.519
The army is only one part of an enormous grave complex.

00:57.757 --> 01:00.604
Archaeologists are still excavating the site,...

01:00.721 --> 01:02.907
...but there are areas that are open to visitors.

01:03.474 --> 01:06.256
Thank you for watching our travel video series.

01:06.436 --> 01:07.360
See you next time.
