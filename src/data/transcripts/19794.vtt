Hi, this is your host Naomi.

00:02.627 --> 00:06.427
I'd like to show you the world's most remote monasteries.

00:07.318 --> 00:12.963
In the Trabzon region of Turkey lies the archaic and secluded Sumela Monastery.

00:13.592 --> 00:18.426
It stands on rather unusual grounds, having been built into a rocky cliff.

00:18.975 --> 00:24.999
Inside the monastery are several noteworthy places, including a library, a rock church...

00:25.223 --> 00:28.209
...and a spring venerated by the Greek Orthodox religion.

00:29.399 --> 00:32.221
Among the most awe-inspiring treasured sites...

00:32.284 --> 00:35.077
...amidst the green of western Bhutan's mountains...

00:35.191 --> 00:37.191
...is the Tiger's Nest Monastery.

00:37.762 --> 00:43.193
A cultural symbol of Bhutan, this Buddhist temple has a 1200-year history...

00:43.383 --> 00:46.181
...and a rich sense of art, religion and culture.

00:46.705 --> 00:51.657
Today, it continues its illustrious beginnings by still serving as a monastery.

00:51.917 --> 00:56.239
The monastery is built in a cave where an ancient guru once meditated.

00:57.447 --> 01:00.642
Built into the sheer, rocky cliff face of Montenegro...

01:00.732 --> 01:04.438
...is the Serb Orthodox Church, Ostrog Monastery.

01:05.005 --> 01:09.203
This sacred structure is Montenegro's primary pilgrimage site,...

01:09.353 --> 01:12.006
...and is dedicated to Saint Basil of Ostrog.

01:12.542 --> 01:15.805
The immaculate whitewash which covers part of this edifice...

01:15.894 --> 01:19.650
...creates clean lines and stands out against the gray-red rock.

01:20.733 --> 01:23.327
Resting at a height of 3,600 meters,...

01:23.441 --> 01:27.591
...Thiksey Monastery graces Northern India's Indus Valley region.

01:28.027 --> 01:30.433
It is an elaborate 12-story building...

01:30.533 --> 01:33.437
...which sits magnanimously on a hilltop in Ladakh...

01:33.611 --> 01:38.379
...and is also called ''Mini Potala" due to its close resemblance to Potala Palace.

01:38.824 --> 01:43.607
It has been especially acclaimed for its intricate and rich collection of Buddhist art.

01:44.925 --> 01:46.903
Set against the stunning backdrop...

01:46.992 --> 01:50.553
...of trenchant mountains is the mystic Tatev Monastery.

01:50.994 --> 01:53.857
Bearing a magical ambience of pure divinity,...

01:53.987 --> 01:58.651
...this monastery has blessed Armenian lands since the 9th century.

01:59.057 --> 02:02.534
After the region's best school was built here in the 10th century,...

02:02.637 --> 02:06.635
...Tatev Monastery became a focal point for scholars and the arts.
