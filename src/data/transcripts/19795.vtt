Google Drive is the place to store all of your stuff.

00:05.646 --> 00:09.741
Everything that used to be trapped on a single computer at home or in the office...

00:10.003 --> 00:14.015
...is available for you to view, edit and share from any device.

00:14.507 --> 00:16.195
And now with the Google Drive mobile app,...

00:16.487 --> 00:18.502
...your stuff is also available wherever you are.

00:19.809 --> 00:24.459
You can search for, open and share files, and even make them available offline.

00:28.599 --> 00:30.190
When you take photos and videos,...

00:30.710 --> 00:34.265
...just upload them to Drive for safekeeping, organizing and sharing...

00:34.585 --> 00:35.816
...right from your phone or tablet.

00:36.403 --> 00:40.859
And with our editors built right into Google Drive, mobile collaboration is easy.

00:41.221 --> 00:47.669
You can create new documents, make edits, change formatting, and even leave comments.

00:52.445 --> 00:56.202
In spreadsheets you can edit cells, add new rows and columns...

00:56.643 --> 00:58.292
...or create completely new files.

01:01.979 --> 01:05.148
You can even view your presentations, see animations...

01:05.435 --> 01:06.943
...and rehearse speaker notes on the go.

01:08.912 --> 01:11.248
To get the most out of your files from wherever you are,...

01:11.513 --> 01:17.929
