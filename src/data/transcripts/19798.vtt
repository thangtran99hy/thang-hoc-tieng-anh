00:01.153 --> 00:03.843
With across the board budget cuts all but guaranteed,...

00:04.115 --> 00:07.584
...some government agencies have already placed a freeze on hiring.

00:08.086 --> 00:11.519
At the Federal Aviation Administration, up to 40,000 workers...

00:11.670 --> 00:13.663
...expect to see their hours reduced.

00:13.911 --> 00:19.584
It means that I will probably be late on a house payment, not buy enough groceries,...

00:19.902 --> 00:23.113
...and then you throw that with gas prices going up, it's devastating.

00:23.382 --> 00:28.712
The same is true for Customs and Border Security agents, for meat inspectors and educators.

00:29.220 --> 00:32.970
Low-income families and the long-term unemployed will also lose benefits.

00:33.410 --> 00:35.723
The net effect, says budget expert Scott Collender,...

00:36.027 --> 00:39.113
...is negative stimulus for an economy that's barely growing.

00:39.443 --> 00:42.281
Without businesses spending, without consumers spending, without trade helping,...

00:42.980 --> 00:45.678
...lower government spending is going to hurt and hurt substantially.

00:46.503 --> 00:50.819
Estimates say the cuts could shave more than half a percent from gross domestic output.

00:51.358 --> 00:56.215
That's enough for the International Monetary Fund to revise earlier estimates for US growth.

00:56.627 --> 00:58.353
IMF spokesman William Murray.

00:58.907 --> 01:05.210
A lot of it depends upon how aggressively or how fully sequestration is implemented.

01:05.893 --> 01:09.385
But there will be an impact on global growth.

01:09.603 --> 01:12.803
Analysts say the spending cuts could cause delays in shipping...

01:13.043 --> 01:15.314
...and cut US demand for imported goods.

01:15.729 --> 01:18.196
Most frustrating, says economist Charles Konigsberg,...

01:18.518 --> 01:20.552
...is that the crisis could have been avoided.

01:20.793 --> 01:23.089
I think it's a lose-lose situation.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.070
Everyone loses.

01:24.758 --> 01:28.066
The cuts come as the economy was showing signs of progress.

01:28.485 --> 01:33.343
Despite the setback, President Barack Obama said negotiations with Congress would continue.

01:33.767 --> 01:36.402
If Congress comes to its senses,...

01:37.459 --> 01:40.997
...a week from now, a month from now, three months from now,...

01:41.896 --> 01:47.394
...then there's a lot of open running room there for us to grow our economy much more quickly.

01:48.072 --> 01:50.831
