My son, Flint Lockwood, always loved to invent things.

00:11.815 --> 00:13.693
Cheeseburger.

00:14.179 --> 00:16.327
Sometimes his inventions were great.

00:17.270 --> 00:20.865
And other times, well, not so much.

00:21.914 --> 00:22.185
Help!

00:22.351 --> 00:22.669
Help!

00:22.745 --> 00:23.121
Help!

00:26.397 --> 00:29.333
We had to leave Swallow Falls so things could get cleaned up.

00:30.846 --> 00:37.097
But when we returned, something big was left over.

00:46.219 --> 00:48.951
I can't believe my machine created all of this!

00:49.373 --> 00:51.297
Are those shrimpanzees?

00:51.550 --> 00:52.181
Butter.

00:52.313 --> 00:53.853
Look! Mosquitoast.

00:54.331 --> 00:54.969
Perky.

00:55.234 --> 00:57.224
Those are some tasty-looking jellyfish.

00:57.397 --> 00:57.995
Hungry!

00:58.259 --> 01:00.579
It's enough to make a grown man cry.

01:00.974 --> 01:02.394
But not this man.

01:02.567 --> 01:03.989
Get back in there, tear.

01:05.893 --> 01:07.009
This September.

01:07.425 --> 01:08.270
Did you hear something?

01:12.903 --> 01:14.649
What was that?

01:20.603 --> 01:22.650
Tacodile Supreme.

01:24.619 --> 01:25.601
It's no picnic.

01:25.751 --> 01:26.511
Hold on, everyone!

01:27.066 --> 01:28.143
There's a leek in the boat!

01:32.717 --> 01:33.967
Saving the world.

01:34.173 --> 01:36.629
We have to shut down the machine before the food animals...

01:36.710 --> 01:38.527
...get off the island and invade the mainland.

01:39.050 --> 01:43.317
All we have to do is cross the breakfast bog, brave the food animal jungle...

01:43.509 --> 01:45.639
...and scale the big rock candy mountain.

01:46.499 --> 01:46.984
Piece of cake.

01:50.019 --> 01:52.433
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs Two.

01:52.543 --> 01:53.897
I think I'll name him Berry.

01:54.045 --> 01:55.107
Sam, don't touch it!

01:55.233 --> 01:55.827
Put it down!

02:01.246 --> 02:01.988
Seriously?
