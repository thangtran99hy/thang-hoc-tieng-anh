00:00.255 --> 00:03.335
What if the next big thing isn't a thing at all?

00:04.501 --> 00:07.814
It's lots of things all waking up,...

00:12.348 --> 00:16.765
...becoming part of the global phenomenon we call the "Internet of everything."

00:19.213 --> 00:23.637
Trees will talk to networks who'll talk to scientists about climate change.

00:24.364 --> 00:29.125
Cars will talk to road sensors who'll talk to stoplights about traffic efficiency.

00:30.290 --> 00:35.302
The ambulance will talk to patient records who'll talk to doctors about saving lives.

00:36.319 --> 00:39.115
It's going to be amazing and exciting.

00:39.819 --> 00:45.103
And maybe, most remarkably, not that far away.

00:46.065 --> 00:47.483
The next big thing?

00:48.301 --> 00:49.757
We're going to wake the world up...

00:51.239 --> 00:55.096
...and watch with eyes wide as it gets to work.

00:56.522 --> 00:57.186
Cisco.

00:58.126 --> 00:59.633
Tomorrow starts here.
