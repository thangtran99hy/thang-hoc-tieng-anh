What is your best day ever?

00:06.469 --> 00:08.823
Go roller skating, I love roller skating.

00:09.980 --> 00:12.694
Riding a giraffe with monkeys.

00:13.499 --> 00:15.308
Driving a Ferrari.

00:20.512 --> 00:24.049
First I'd do a couple, like, five or six arcade games,...

00:24.177 --> 00:27.801
...and I might even want to find new animals.

00:27.996 --> 00:32.102
I'll go to my grandma's with my monkeys and my giraffe...

00:32.861 --> 00:34.681
...and ride on the roof with it.

00:37.707 --> 00:38.953
Going to the moon,...

00:39.923 --> 00:42.965
...and maybe some other planets?

00:44.222 --> 00:46.367
Yeah, awesome day.

00:47.733 --> 00:50.873
