One of the Earth's natural beauties, yet we rarely hear about it.

00:09.706 --> 00:13.757
But now, the world's biggest salt desert, the Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia,...

00:14.107 --> 00:16.339
...is attracting tourists like never before.

00:16.761 --> 00:21.882
A private air service on an antique plane opened flights over the area in November,...

00:22.121 --> 00:24.833
...and it's fast proving to be a popular attraction.

00:25.311 --> 00:27.567
Around 60,000 people visited last year.

00:28.013 --> 00:31.376
But since the new flight service was launched, the bookings have shot up,...

00:31.687 --> 00:34.369
...and it's totally full for this month and February.

00:34.965 --> 00:38.464
Hercules de Souza is manager of the Aerosur Airline.

00:42.665 --> 00:47.025
Now, tourists from the United States are going to arrive directly to the salt plant.

00:47.271 --> 00:49.796
Before, they had to pass through the towns along the way...

00:50.094 --> 00:53.219
...and take different forms of transport to arrive to this wonder.

00:56.017 --> 00:58.467
The area is around 4,000 square miles,...

00:58.562 --> 01:01.563
...situated in the southwest of the country near the Chilean border.

01:02.090 --> 01:06.202
Around 40,000 years ago, the Salar de Uyuni was part of a lake...

01:06.307 --> 01:08.665
...that covered a huge part of the Andean Highlands.

01:09.125 --> 01:13.338
Then it dried up, leaving a salt desert and moonlike landscapes.

01:13.815 --> 01:17.481
There is so much salt there that locals even make buildings out of it.

01:17.867 --> 01:20.025
In fact, the airport is built of the stuff.

01:20.473 --> 01:25.843
Pink flamingos, one-thousand-year-old cacti, and rare hummingbirds make their home here.

01:26.251 --> 01:29.883
At night, it freezes, and in the day, there's a blazing sun.

01:30.109 --> 01:32.059
But, it's still worth the trip.
