00:01.121 --> 00:02.911
Ever wonder how a new pope is chosen?

00:03.333 --> 00:06.478
Here are ten facts pertaining to the pope's selection process.

00:07.142 --> 00:07.779
Number ten.

00:08.325 --> 00:12.413
The College of Cardinals in Vatican City is responsible for choosing an elected pope...

00:12.714 --> 00:14.480
...by a process known as conclave.

00:14.903 --> 00:18.174
Only cardinals under the age of 80 are able to cast their vote.

00:18.709 --> 00:19.354
Number nine.

00:19.969 --> 00:24.033
This may surprise you, but there are a few qualifications for a person to become pope.

00:24.511 --> 00:28.244
Cardinals can elect any baptized man, and even that is negotiable,..

00:28.365 --> 00:32.247
...as the chosen male must be willing to be baptized if he accepts the election.

00:32.869 --> 00:33.434
Number eight.

00:33.975 --> 00:36.203
As per tradition for the past few centuries,...

00:36.333 --> 00:39.513
...the chosen elected male is usually among the College of Cardinals.

00:39.952 --> 00:40.625
Number seven.

00:41.137 --> 00:44.251
The voting cardinals have to write their choice for pope on a ballot...

00:44.414 --> 00:48.183
...and disguise their handwriting to prevent others from knowing who they are in favor of.

00:48.621 --> 00:49.337
Number six.

00:49.739 --> 00:53.421
The electoral conclave must meet for discussions at least 15 days...

00:53.587 --> 00:57.169
...but no more than 20 days following a pope's death or resignation.

00:57.739 --> 00:58.448
Number five.

00:58.903 --> 01:03.259
The new pope will be officially elected after a two-thirds plus one majority is counted,...

01:03.481 --> 01:04.798
...following the voting process.

01:05.220 --> 01:05.892
Number four.

01:06.375 --> 01:08.979
The cardinals gather in Rome and reside at the Vatican...

01:09.077 --> 01:11.209
...in a Santa Maria house during the election.

01:11.521 --> 01:16.179
Phones, computers, newspapers and televisions are banned during the proceedings.

01:16.634 --> 01:17.221
Number three.

01:17.761 --> 01:21.950
Besides the cardinals, about 70 other people are allowed in the Santa Maria house,...

01:22.082 --> 01:23.862
...including housekeepers and doctors.

01:24.355 --> 01:24.971
Number two.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.703
As the rectangular ballot papers are counted,...

01:27.901 --> 01:30.563
...the names of the cardinals who have received votes are announced.

01:30.849 --> 01:34.567
Each paper is pierced with a needle, putting all of the ballots on a single thread.

01:35.100 --> 01:35.772
Number one.

01:36.227 --> 01:38.252
Following the voting, the ballots are burned.

01:38.492 --> 01:42.081
Chemicals are added to the mixture which creates either black or white smoke.

01:42.521 --> 01:45.849
Black signifies that there were not enough votes for someone to be elected pope,...

01:46.089 --> 01:48.482
...while white means a new pope had been elected.

01:48.732 --> 01:51.272
The colored smoke alerts onlookers outdoors.
