00:07.728 --> 00:10.011
The last Super Bowl was played right here.

00:10.415 --> 00:11.621
Please don't tell me it was a classic.

00:12.041 --> 00:12.879
Classic game.

00:13.320 --> 00:14.865
80,000 people on their feet.

00:15.017 --> 00:16.361
Seconds left on the clock,...

00:16.837 --> 00:18.445
...so Hubie throws a Hail Mary.

00:19.165 --> 00:19.808
Touchdown!

00:23.545 --> 00:25.417
166 back online.

00:28.438 --> 00:30.435
60 years ago, Earth was attacked.

00:31.546 --> 00:34.319
We won the war, but they destroyed half the planet.

00:35.327 --> 00:36.682
Everyone's been evacuated.

00:37.015 --> 00:38.311
Nothing human remains.

00:40.161 --> 00:41.587
We're here for drone repair.

00:42.265 --> 00:43.224
We're the mop-up crew.

00:46.947 --> 00:48.044
This is Jack Harper.

00:50.265 --> 00:51.025
I'm good to go.

00:52.177 --> 00:55.989
Two more weeks Jack, then we can finally leave and join the others.

00:56.452 --> 00:57.795
Don't take any chances.

01:22.575 --> 01:23.735
I've been watching you, Jack.

01:24.690 --> 01:25.584
You're curious.

01:26.333 --> 01:28.179
What are you looking for in those books?

01:29.771 --> 01:31.537
Do they bring back old memories?

01:33.562 --> 01:35.148
We have an unidentified impact.

01:35.525 --> 01:37.375
Don't ask too many questions.

01:37.859 --> 01:38.697
They are human.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.841
This is ordering you to return to tower.

01:43.079 --> 01:43.617
Jack.

01:44.841 --> 01:45.791
How do you know my name?

01:46.406 --> 01:47.677
They're firing on survivors.

01:48.452 --> 01:49.424
Stand down!

01:52.118 --> 01:52.852
What have you done?

01:53.471 --> 01:54.335
You can't protect you.

01:57.149 --> 01:58.841
They won't stop until they find me.

02:00.154 --> 02:03.762
If you're looking for the truth, that's where you'll find it.

02:04.938 --> 02:06.235
You need to know what happened.

02:08.135 --> 02:09.300
What aren't you telling me?

02:09.568 --> 02:10.747
Who are you?

02:14.441 --> 02:16.149
Jack, this is ordering you to stand down.

02:16.573 --> 02:17.630
I'm not gonna do that.

02:20.443 --> 02:21.367
This is the only way.
