00:06.099 --> 00:09.919
I will move forward step by step on the basis of credible deterrence...

00:09.975 --> 00:12.185
...to build trust between the South and the North.

00:14.045 --> 00:18.360
Trust can be built through dialog and by honoring promises that have already been made.

00:20.501 --> 00:23.803
It is my hope that North Korea will abide by international norms...

00:24.177 --> 00:26.937
...and make the right choice so that the trust building process...

00:27.011 --> 00:29.579
...of the Korean Peninsula can move forward.

00:37.592 --> 00:41.505
The era of happiness that I envision is one that simultaneously unlocks...

00:41.575 --> 00:46.107
...an era of happiness on the Korean Peninsula while also contributing...

00:46.213 --> 00:49.726
...to ushering in an era of happiness throughout the global community.

00:50.670 --> 00:54.949
To ease tensions and conflicts and further spread peace and cooperation in Asia,...

00:55.364 --> 00:59.183
...I will work to strengthen trust with countries in the region...

00:59.270 --> 01:05.066
...including the United States, China, Japan, Russia and other Asian and Oceanic countries.

01:09.921 --> 01:14.918
Moreover, I envision a Korea that shares more deeply the suffering of others...

01:15.271 --> 01:19.422
...while also contributing to the resolution of key global issues.

01:24.570 --> 01:25.556
Fellow citizens.

01:27.025 --> 01:32.098
Today, I assume my duties as the 18th-term President of the Republic of Korea.

01:33.141 --> 01:37.284
Let me assure you that I will journey with the people who have bestowed...

01:37.622 --> 01:43.375
...this tremendous responsibility upon me to truly open a new era of hope.

01:49.990 --> 01:54.129
The responsibility for governing the nation falls on the shoulders of the President,...

01:54.539 --> 01:57.075
...and the fate of the nation is determined by the people.

01:57.768 --> 02:03.935
I ask for your strength and support as we take the Republic of Korea on a new path.

02:12.231 --> 02:16.740
We stand on the threshold of a new era where our nation and people must walk in unity...

02:17.163 --> 02:22.731
...and where the nation's development and the people's happiness jointly form a virtuous cycle.

02:26.179 --> 02:30.448
The success of our journey hinges on mutual confidence and trust...

02:30.575 --> 02:32.383
...between the government and the people,...

02:32.729 --> 02:36.278
...and their ability to move forward in partnership.

02:38.955 --> 02:41.907
I will earn the trust of the people by ensuring that our government...

02:42.003 --> 02:44.858
...remains clean, transparent and competent.

02:45.345 --> 02:48.515
I will endeavor to shed popular distrust of government...

02:48.774 --> 02:51.696
...and strive to elevate the capital of trust.

02:53.125 --> 02:57.349
I humbly ask for your support, wherever you may be,...

02:58.035 --> 03:02.398
...not only in the service of your own individual interests,...

03:03.078 --> 03:07.199
...but also in answering the call of the common good.
