Turners is a family business.

00:14.403 --> 00:19.097
It actually started with two Turner brothers in 1930.

00:19.382 --> 00:23.020
One drove a lorry when he was eighteen, and the other one was sixteen...

00:23.108 --> 00:27.154
...and he helped to load the lorry, and they took produce that was grown locally...

00:27.261 --> 00:31.096
...to the flower markets and the vegetable markets in London.

00:32.239 --> 00:33.713
They developed it from there.

00:34.392 --> 00:40.663
And in 1952, it became a limited company and the name Turner Soham Limited was founded then,...

00:41.437 --> 00:47.968
...and they slowly grew the vehicles and started refrigerated transport in the early 70s...

00:48.047 --> 00:50.466
...when right at the foundation of that.

00:51.042 --> 00:54.050
And really by the time I joined the business in the 80s,...

00:54.567 --> 00:59.011
...we were a relatively large East Anglian based haulage company.

00:59.097 --> 01:06.939
We operated 120 vehicles and we had a good foundation to try and develop,...

01:08.571 --> 01:09.859
...grow the company from there.

01:11.076 --> 01:18.949
Well, during the 80s we continued to try and develop and grow the business...

01:19.071 --> 01:24.522
...and we were becoming more and more known as a refrigerated transport company.

01:25.207 --> 01:26.366
And then, we had the opportunity...

01:26.449 --> 01:30.215
...to buy a small business that was involved in powder tankers,...

01:30.485 --> 01:38.939
... and by the early 90s, it was clear that we needed to specialise in, and really we were...

01:39.057 --> 01:41.479
...our core strength was the refrigerated market.

01:42.197 --> 01:45.935
We were gaining new business in the tanker market...

01:46.615 --> 01:52.025
...and really we decided to focus on those two areas to develop the business further.

01:52.721 --> 01:58.687
In this century, about five years ago, I had always wanted to go into fuel,...

02:00.346 --> 02:03.490
...and we got an opportunity to run a few fuel tankers...

02:04.119 --> 02:07.984
...and that has proved to be very successful for Turners,...

02:08.057 --> 02:10.283
...and we have managed to grow that in five years...

02:10.945 --> 02:16.035
...to have around about 200 vehicles now operating on fuel deliveries.

02:16.906 --> 02:22.094
So, we are the third biggest in the UK now in fuel after five years.

02:22.229 --> 02:25.576
So, I think we have done very well in that sector.
