Hi! I'm Naomi and I'm very excited to show you the world's greatest attractions.

00:13.101 --> 00:18.775
Called the first wonder of the world, China's Stone Forest spans 96,000 acres.

00:19.503 --> 00:24.438
Ancient rock formations, about 270 million years old, dominate the landscape.

00:25.247 --> 00:28.899
Many legends surround the different shapes and arrangements of the forest.

00:29.510 --> 00:34.248
The stones resemble an unimaginable variety of humans, animals and trees.

00:34.839 --> 00:38.783
The phenomenon can also be observed underground and within several lakes.

00:39.541 --> 00:43.688
Visitors hold festivals and pay tribute to the mythology of this natural wonder.

00:44.681 --> 00:47.442
Thank you for watching our travel video series.

00:47.763 --> 00:48.630
