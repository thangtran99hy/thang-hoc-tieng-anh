Former NBA star Dennis Rodman left Pyongyang Friday,...

00:03.797 --> 00:07.037
...singing the praises of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un.

00:07.202 --> 00:07.843
He's proud.

00:08.987 --> 00:12.662
His country likes him. Not likes him, love him.

00:13.505 --> 00:14.531
Love him and guess what?

00:15.751 --> 00:16.966
Yes, yes, I love him.

00:17.263 --> 00:18.567
I love, the guy's awesome.

00:19.009 --> 00:21.773
In an unexpected round of basketball diplomacy,...

00:22.146 --> 00:25.747
...Rodman spent time with Kim during his visit to North Korea this week.

00:26.287 --> 00:29.783
Together, they watched the Harlem Globetrotters play and ate sushi.

00:30.461 --> 00:34.783
They mostly do one thing. You know what, it was at least how they were so honest.

00:35.729 --> 00:41.391
And then one thing that, guess what? His grandfather and his father were great leaders.

00:42.585 --> 00:43.855
He's such a proud man.

00:45.055 --> 00:48.928
The basketball star is the most high profile American to meet Kim...

00:49.052 --> 00:51.887
...since he took power back in December 2011.

00:52.525 --> 00:56.666
He arrived Monday with a television crew and three members of the Harlem Globetrotters.

00:57.327 --> 01:01.487
The meeting took place amidst high tension between Washington and Pyongyang,...

01:01.971 --> 01:06.131
...following the communist nation's underground nuclear test two weeks ago.
