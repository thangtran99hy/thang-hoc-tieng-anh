The whole universe depends on everything fitting together just right.

00:19.735 --> 00:24.008
Can we choose to be born or we fit into the times we're born into?

00:30.174 --> 00:32.255
And finally, we are pleased to announce...

00:32.342 --> 00:35.827
...that the films selected as the Best Picture nominees for 2012 are:...

00:40.193 --> 00:40.737
What's your name?

00:41.112 --> 00:41.517
Django.

00:41.801 --> 00:43.560
Then you're exactly the one I'm looking for.

00:47.147 --> 00:48.915
We're responsible for these people.

00:49.193 --> 00:50.031
I'm responsible.

00:52.454 --> 00:54.471
007 reporting for duty.

00:54.661 --> 00:55.535
Where the hell have you been?

01:00.579 --> 01:01.360
It's awesome!

01:01.991 --> 01:05.273
I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure.

01:05.578 --> 01:07.897
My mother warned me about getting into cars with strange men.

01:08.279 --> 01:09.467
This isn't a car.

01:09.763 --> 01:11.457
What's your name, rather than Batman?

01:12.009 --> 01:12.443
Lenny.

01:12.853 --> 01:12.915
Lenny.

01:25.755 --> 01:28.403
Let me tell ya, when life reaches out at a moment like this,...

01:28.489 --> 01:29.833
...it's a sin if you don't reach back.

01:29.961 --> 01:32.319
I'm telling you, it's a sin if you don't reach back.
