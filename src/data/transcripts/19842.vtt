00:03.106 --> 00:07.831
The Vatican Sistine Chapel in Rome is where cardinals meet in secret to choose a new pope.

00:08.119 --> 00:12.165
Their election system varies depending on rules sometimes modified by the outgoing pope.

00:12.479 --> 00:16.819
A two-thirds majority of cardinal votes is required to elect Benedict XVI's successor.

00:17.731 --> 00:20.467
120 cardinals under the 80-year-old age limit...

00:20.560 --> 00:23.161
...form the College of Cardinals taking part in the ballot.

00:24.119 --> 00:27.048
Their deliberations traditionally begin between 15 and 20 days...

00:27.113 --> 00:29.419
...after the previous pope's death or resignation.

00:30.637 --> 00:34.389
When they enter the papal conclave, the cardinals must take an oath of secrecy...

00:34.519 --> 00:37.005
...which, if broken, means automatic excommunication.

00:37.271 --> 00:40.433
They remain there in total isolation until the new pope is chosen.

00:41.686 --> 00:44.473
Two secret ballots are held each morning and each afternoon.

00:45.307 --> 00:47.201
The papers are destroyed after each count.

00:50.156 --> 00:52.122
As long as the two-thirds majority is not reached,...

00:52.269 --> 00:54.586
...they're burnt with a substance giving off black smoke.

00:54.876 --> 00:57.773
Once a new pope has been elected, white smoke is given off.

00:58.580 --> 01:01.240
Having accepted and chosen the name he wishes to be known by...

01:01.495 --> 01:05.202
...the appointment of the Pontifex Maximus, the Holy Roman Pontiff, is official.

01:06.176 --> 01:09.511
The traditional announcement is then made from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica,...

01:09.980 --> 01:10.866
..."Habemus papam."

01:11.064 --> 01:11.824
"We have a pope."
