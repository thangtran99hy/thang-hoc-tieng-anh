April Fools' Day or All Fools' Day is the one day of the year...

00:03.431 --> 00:06.669
...when you are allowed to mercilessly prank your friends, family and coworkers.

00:06.877 --> 00:08.683
How exactly did this day come about?

00:08.934 --> 00:11.923
We don't actually know for sure what started the celebration of April Fools' Day.

00:12.145 --> 00:14.357
References can be found as early as the 1500s...

00:14.637 --> 00:16.935
...but these accounts are infrequent and not very detailed.

00:17.206 --> 00:20.580
The most popular theory is that it began around 1582 in France...

00:20.717 --> 00:22.224
...during the reformation of the calendar.

00:22.392 --> 00:24.440
Before France adopted the Gregorian calendar,...

00:24.554 --> 00:26.297
...they celebrated New Year's for eight days,...

00:26.549 --> 00:29.439
...beginning on March 25th and ending on April 1st.

00:29.756 --> 00:33.954
When they switched calendar systems, the eighth day moved from April 1st to January 1st.

00:34.187 --> 00:37.981
Because they didn't have Internet, phones, social media and a mail system,...

00:38.236 --> 00:40.900
...a lot of people didn't hear about this change until years later.

00:41.171 --> 00:44.591
Those that did not hear about the change continued to celebrate New Year's in April.

00:44.843 --> 00:46.795
Others refused to celebrate it out of rebellion.

00:46.997 --> 00:49.677
Those that had been informed of the change and adjusted their calendars...

00:49.772 --> 00:52.636
...began to make fun of these fools who are uninformed or rebellious.

00:52.812 --> 00:56.461
These harassment evolved into a tradition of playing pranks on the first day of April,...

00:56.735 --> 00:58.003
...and this spread to other countries.

00:58.403 --> 01:00.848
However, April Fools' Day was already established in England...

01:01.007 --> 01:03.658
...which didn't switch calendar systems until 1752.

01:03.905 --> 01:07.597
Also, people were already engaging in pranks and lightheartedness around this time of year,...

01:07.881 --> 01:09.996
...long before the French switched their calendar systems.

01:10.325 --> 01:13.049
Such is in the case of the ancient Roman festival of Hilaria.

01:13.393 --> 01:16.657
Other celebrations of April Fools' Day have slightly different traditions...

01:16.754 --> 01:17.987
...depending on the country you are in.

01:18.197 --> 01:21.485
But they all have the similar theme of pranking or humiliating individuals.

01:21.679 --> 01:24.817
In France, they try to tape an image of a fish to your back without you noticing.

01:24.943 --> 01:26.468
And in Portugal, they throw flour at you.

01:26.653 --> 01:28.943
In England, you are only supposed to pull jokes until noon.

01:29.155 --> 01:31.700
If you pull a joke after noon, you are called an April fool.

01:31.965 --> 01:33.138
In the United States and Britain,...

01:33.293 --> 01:36.697
...even popular media outlets and companies have been known to get involved in the fun.

01:37.279 --> 01:41.812
In 1996, Taco Bell announced that it had purchased the Liberty Bell from the city of Philadelphia...

01:42.108 --> 01:44.105
...and was going to rename it the Taco Liberty Bell.

01:44.309 --> 01:47.846
In 1992, NPR claimed that Richard Nixon will be running again for President.

01:48.009 --> 01:51.556
British publication The Guardian famously pranked the public in 1977,...

01:51.683 --> 01:55.038
...when they said that a semicolon-shaped island in the Indian Ocean had been discovered.

01:55.275 --> 01:59.351
This hoax is credited for launching the trend of April Fools' Day pranks by British tabloids.

01:59.711 --> 02:02.475
So hopefully, you now know a little more about the history of April Fools' Day.

02:02.755 --> 02:05.081
Or, at least what we think the history of it is.
