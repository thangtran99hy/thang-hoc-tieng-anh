Tessa Youngner sees walking to school as a chance to do what she likes best:...

00:07.219 --> 00:08.191
...listen to music.

00:08.357 --> 00:11.047
There is a lot of work to be done, especially in high school.

00:11.135 --> 00:15.086
When you take harder classes, there is not always a lot of free time to listen to music...

00:15.180 --> 00:17.003
...or watch TV or be with friends.

00:17.139 --> 00:21.384
We want to talk to you about what you think about walking safely.

00:21.723 --> 00:23.967
But after attending a workshop at her school,...

00:24.246 --> 00:27.856
...Youngner now knows what getting absorbed in music might cause her.

00:27.996 --> 00:30.297
I knew that it might distract me a little bit,...

00:30.406 --> 00:35.071
...but I did not know that it could be as serious as getting hit by a car.

00:35.647 --> 00:38.087
Youngner is not the only distracted walker.

00:38.408 --> 00:41.626
I usually text or go on the Internet while I'm walking.

00:41.863 --> 00:45.678
My phone can do everything, and I guess it's just about how it is for any teenagers.

00:45.942 --> 00:49.205
What if I told you that teens are more likely to get hit by a car...

00:49.280 --> 00:50.999
...when crossing the street than younger kids.

00:51.275 --> 00:54.641
Linda Watkins, an instructor with Safe Kids Worldwide,...

00:55.022 --> 01:00.478
...understands why teens don't see a problem with walking while texting or listening to music.

01:00.712 --> 01:03.893
Kids these days think that they can really multitask.

01:04.333 --> 01:07.779
So they think that I can listen to my music.

01:07.870 --> 01:12.551
I can watch for traffic, and then I can cross the street all at the same time.

01:14.003 --> 01:17.869
But often, they don't realize how dangerous crossing the street has become.

01:18.525 --> 01:21.428
There is the problem with a distracted driver, too.

01:21.667 --> 01:24.615
So you're a distracted driver, you're a distracted pedestrian,...

01:24.967 --> 01:26.929
...and that's just a recipe for disaster.

01:27.055 --> 01:30.281
I'm gonna ask you some questions about pedestrian safety.

01:30.473 --> 01:33.469
This workshop organized by Safe Kids Worldwide...

01:33.835 --> 01:36.588
...made the participating teens part of the solution.

01:37.065 --> 01:40.129
They say, they need to be reminded all the time.

01:40.378 --> 01:44.380
They need PSAs, they need posters,...

01:44.473 --> 01:47.477
...maybe banners on their cellphones or things like that...

01:47.959 --> 01:51.733
...that's going to remind them that this is important.

01:52.111 --> 01:58.393
The group spokesperson, Angela Mickalide, says giving teenagers the facts raises their awareness.

01:58.581 --> 02:03.488
Today in the United States, 61 children will be hit while crossing the street.

02:03.830 --> 02:10.060
And this year, 500 children, 19 and under, will be killed from a pedestrian incident.

02:10.555 --> 02:14.375
Research shows that distracted walking has become a global problem...

02:14.566 --> 02:18.480
...due to increasing cell phone use in cities and urbanization.

02:18.787 --> 02:20.767
This is a particular problem in India.

02:21.249 --> 02:26.539
And in China, we have many people moving from the rural areas to the more urban areas...

02:26.810 --> 02:31.165
...while at the same time we're not providing them with the necessary education.

02:31.739 --> 02:36.390
Linda Watkins says she doesn't ask teens to stop using their hand-held devices...

02:36.487 --> 02:40.143
... or earbuds whenever they walk, just some of the time.

02:40.499 --> 02:42.981
She says the golden rule remains the same:...

02:43.323 --> 02:47.251
...look both ways, then again, before crossing the street.

02:48.432 --> 02:52.315
