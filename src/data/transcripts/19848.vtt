Oil, Gas and Petrochemicals.

00:06.900 --> 00:12.724
When oil wells get older, it becomes more difficult to pump oil efficiently,...

00:13.386 --> 00:14.978
...as the pressure decreases.

00:16.219 --> 00:20.905
The recovery of oil can be improved by using water injection.

00:21.863 --> 00:26.898
It can be improved from 15 percent to as much as 50 percent.

00:28.175 --> 00:34.298
Water injection wells are usually located at the periphery or edge of the field...

00:35.101 --> 00:37.991
...and by forcing water below the accumulation,...

00:38.701 --> 00:42.922
...the crude oil is pushed towards the producing wells near the center.

00:44.488 --> 00:46.715
As well as raising the pressure in the wells,...

00:47.412 --> 00:51.132
...water injection also keeps oil below its bubble point.

00:52.256 --> 00:57.126
This is the point when gas can escape from the crude oil in great quantities...

00:57.749 --> 00:59.409
...and is produced more than oil.

01:00.795 --> 01:03.233
Before water is injected into a well though,...

01:03.861 --> 01:09.104
...it must be treated to remove solids, bacteria and oxygen...

01:09.537 --> 01:12.413
...that might cause damage or corrode the equipment.

01:13.417 --> 01:17.266
Sea water can be used for injection on offshore platforms,...

01:18.117 --> 01:22.063
...but it needs to be desalinated, to have the salt removed,...

01:22.871 --> 01:26.375
...because untreated sea water can be highly corrosive.
