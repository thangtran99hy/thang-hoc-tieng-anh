The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, sometimes known as the BTC pipeline,...

00:14.458 --> 00:18.041
...transports crude oil 1,000 miles...

00:18.549 --> 00:22.912
...from the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli oil field in the Caspian Sea...

00:23.661 --> 00:25.209
...to the Mediterranean Sea.

00:26.577 --> 00:33.104
The length of the pipeline itself is 1,760 kilometers,...

00:34.079 --> 00:37.565
...so it's one of the longest pipelines in the world.

00:39.038 --> 00:43.655
It passes through Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey.

00:45.198 --> 00:49.795
The pipeline has a 42-inch diameter for most of its length,...

00:50.629 --> 00:55.492
...narrowing to a 36-inch diameter when it gets near Ceyhan.

00:56.999 --> 01:03.967
Normal capacity, from 2009 onwards, is expected to be 1,000,000 barrels,...

01:04.825 --> 01:10.588
...in other words, 160,000 cubic metres of oil per day.

01:11.929 --> 01:15.608
It has a capacity of 10 million barrels of oil.

01:16.939 --> 01:21.610
It is hoped that the pipeline will be in use for 50 years.
