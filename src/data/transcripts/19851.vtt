My name is Tia Kratter, I've been at Pixar 16 years,...

00:06.240 --> 00:10.085
...and I have quit every year for the past 11 years.

00:10.918 --> 00:13.944
Tia Kratter: she's one of the most amazing, talented artists here.

00:14.079 --> 00:15.659
She's worked on just about every film.

00:17.288 --> 00:20.325
I grew up in a family of practical jokesters.

00:25.577 --> 00:29.773
It's April 1st, 1998; something like that.

00:30.581 --> 00:35.793
So I e-mailed the entire company and said I'm leaving Pixar.

00:36.328 --> 00:36.959
Goodbye.

00:39.683 --> 00:43.023
And I got about 20 to 30 people that bit.

00:43.887 --> 00:46.248
A couple of women in the production office...

00:46.731 --> 00:50.857
...actually went out and ordered this beautiful little chocolate cake.

00:52.011 --> 00:55.925
The benefits were so good that I just thought, "I have to do this every year."

00:56.999 --> 00:57.798
I just fell for it.

00:58.042 --> 01:01.851
She said a nice goodbye, but it was April 1st that she sent the mail...

01:01.928 --> 01:04.963
...and halfway through the mail you realize, she's not quitting...

01:05.026 --> 01:06.728
...because she's usually in the mail, off to do...

01:06.805 --> 01:09.880
...some super bizarre thing like art direct "Tron 2."

01:11.163 --> 01:14.219
I've quit to go airbrush monster trucks.

01:14.367 --> 01:17.905
I've quit because I went to work in a wax museum,...

01:18.603 --> 01:21.075
...and one year, I had an affair.

01:24.291 --> 01:28.395
There's just enough truth in her e-mail that if you didn't know her, you would buy it...

01:28.471 --> 01:30.307
...and it always causes a stir.

01:30.689 --> 01:35.272
Steve Jobs believed my letter on three separate occasions.

01:35.620 --> 01:36.166
Fact.

01:37.480 --> 01:40.490
We finally got Tia back, she sent a mail; it was obviously April Fools' Day.

01:40.788 --> 01:42.947
It must have been on a Friday or something; she wasn't there.

01:43.288 --> 01:45.801
So what we did is we had her whole office packed up.

01:46.858 --> 01:48.039
We even changed the door.

01:48.967 --> 01:50.750
She came back; the key didn't work.

01:51.259 --> 01:52.684
Then when she finally got it open and went in,...

01:52.929 --> 01:55.947
...and all her stuff was literally boxed up, floor to ceiling.

01:58.545 --> 01:59.515
But it didn't stop.

01:59.774 --> 02:00.821
She quit again this year.

02:04.924 --> 02:06.230
It is so much fun.
