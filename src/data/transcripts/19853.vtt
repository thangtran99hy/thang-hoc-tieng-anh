I'm Joy Behar and you've got Easter traditions.

00:06.201 --> 00:08.251
When I was a kid, it was a major holiday.

00:08.816 --> 00:12.377
The whole family, the Italian family, would gather around my Aunt Rosa's table...

00:12.777 --> 00:16.107
...and stuffed themselves into oblivion with all the food she would cook.

00:16.265 --> 00:18.165
Well, there was an Easter pie that was made.

00:18.276 --> 00:20.660
My Aunt Rose, she would make, it's called the pizza rustica.

00:21.054 --> 00:24.998
And it's this big Italian pie and it consists of, basically, cholesterol.

00:25.335 --> 00:28.253
You have tons of cheese, you have about a dozen eggs in there,...

00:28.401 --> 00:31.733
...heavy cream, salami, and she would bake this thing.

00:31.805 --> 00:35.535
We would eat it on Good Friday and Easter Sunday we would rise from the dead.

00:36.349 --> 00:39.337
Egg hunting was left for American types.

00:39.690 --> 00:42.833
We were Italian Americans and we had a meatball hunt.

00:43.472 --> 00:44.712
We didn't do an egg hunt.

00:45.931 --> 00:47.153
Now I like an egg hunt...

00:47.241 --> 00:49.293
...because I don't have any eggs of my own anymore.

00:50.419 --> 00:53.192
My grandchild has just been born, his name is Luca.
