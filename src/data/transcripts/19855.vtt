00:00.754 --> 00:03.887
If I ride, I will know the way the trees smell after the rain.

00:06.113 --> 00:09.999
I will grow a heart so strong that hospitals will take Tuesdays off.

00:12.317 --> 00:15.995
If I ride uphill, I will eventually get to ride downhill.

00:17.212 --> 00:18.271
That's how it works.

00:19.693 --> 00:22.527
If I ride, road rage will turn into laughter.

00:25.349 --> 00:29.115
And I won't be a boy or a girl,...

00:30.388 --> 00:31.425
I will just be a rider.

00:34.329 --> 00:38.769
If I ride, I will be strong.
