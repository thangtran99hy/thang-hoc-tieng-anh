00:07.077 --> 00:11.997
I was 13 when I first got access to a computer.

00:12.114 --> 00:16.328
My parents bought me a Macintosh in 1984 when I was eight years old.

00:16.411 --> 00:17.647
I was in the sixth grade.

00:17.730 --> 00:19.359
I learned to code in college.

00:19.485 --> 00:23.707
Freshman year first semester, Intro to Computer Science.

00:23.849 --> 00:26.709
I wrote a program that played tic-tac-toe.

00:26.789 --> 00:27.954
I think it was pretty humble beginnings.

00:28.025 --> 00:32.039
I think the first program I wrote asked things like, "What's your favorite color?"...

00:32.583 --> 00:33.514
...or, "How old are you?"

00:33.722 --> 00:38.642
I first learned how to make a green circle and a red square appear on the screen.

00:38.851 --> 00:41.987
The first time I actually had something come up and say, "Hello world"...

00:42.304 --> 00:45.559
...and I made a computer do that; it was just astonishing.

00:45.645 --> 00:47.227
Learning how to program didn't start off as...

00:47.511 --> 00:50.121
...wanting to learn all of computer science...

00:50.203 --> 00:53.307
...or trying to master this discipline or anything like that.

00:53.375 --> 00:56.514
It just started off because I wanted to do this one simple thing.

00:56.606 --> 00:59.320
I wanted to make something that was fun for myself and and my sisters.

00:59.855 --> 01:03.099
I wrote this little program, and then basically just added a little bit to it.

01:03.177 --> 01:04.617
And then when I needed to learn something new...

01:04.839 --> 01:06.892
...I looked it up either in a book or on the Internet...

01:06.963 --> 01:08.109
...and then added a little bit to it.

01:08.228 --> 01:10.856
It's really not unlike playing an instrument or something...

01:11.205 --> 01:12.978
...or you know, playing a sport.

01:15.442 --> 01:16.884
It starts out being very intimidating,...

01:16.965 --> 01:18.649
...but you kind of get the hang of it over time.

01:19.352 --> 01:21.151
Coding is something that can be learned...

01:21.357 --> 01:25.574
...and I know it can be intimidating, a lot of things are intimidating,...

01:26.166 --> 01:28.530
...but you know, what isn't?

01:28.699 --> 01:30.935
A lot of the coding that people do is actually fairly simple.

01:32.124 --> 01:35.059
It's more about the process of breaking down problems...

01:35.133 --> 01:38.563
...than coming up with complicated algorithms...

01:38.633 --> 01:40.243
...as people traditionally think about it.
