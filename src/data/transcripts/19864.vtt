I'm Baauer.

00:01.363 --> 00:01.982
And I'm Rosa.

00:02.375 --> 00:03.073
And you're watching...

00:03.299 --> 00:04.335
...Music Talks.

00:24.607 --> 00:26.889
Hey everybody, we're Music Talks, we're here with Baauer,...

00:26.947 --> 00:28.851
...we're gonna sit down and ask him some questions.

00:29.157 --> 00:29.495
How are you doing?

00:29.798 --> 00:30.505
Good, how are you?

00:30.727 --> 00:31.629
I'm good, thanks.

00:32.360 --> 00:33.052
Alright so,...

00:34.617 --> 00:38.370
...could you have imagined the kind of attention you were gonna get from Harlem Shake?

00:39.294 --> 00:40.224
No, definitely not.

00:40.577 --> 00:43.363
When I was making it, it was just for fun, just fooling around...

00:43.663 --> 00:48.233
...and I had no idea we'll get that kind of crazy attention so it was definitely a surprise.

00:48.443 --> 00:49.315
That will be a good surprise, right?

00:49.424 --> 00:49.570
Yeah.

00:49.741 --> 00:50.739
A very good surprise.

00:52.119 --> 00:54.317
What's your favorite part of the production process?

00:55.913 --> 00:59.408
I like searching for sound or samples to use,...

00:59.737 --> 01:03.660
...looking for a crazy sound that I have never ever heard used in a song before.

01:04.083 --> 01:04.789
That's my favorite part.
