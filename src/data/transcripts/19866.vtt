You have to move into a new place,...

00:02.063 --> 00:05.583
...so it's time to call all your friends and offer to buy them pizza,...

00:06.093 --> 00:11.178
...if they'll just help get all your junk from here into here, then to here.

00:12.031 --> 00:14.650
They all remember the last time you asked for help moving,...

00:14.927 --> 00:17.048
...when they showed up and you weren't even done packing.

00:17.431 --> 00:20.527
Everyone stuffed everything into their cars and it took all day.

00:21.141 --> 00:23.155
That's not even worth a slice of pepperoni.

00:24.191 --> 00:28.694
The secret to making moving a breeze for you and your friends are three simple tips.

00:29.017 --> 00:31.715
First, no such thing as too many boxes.

00:32.179 --> 00:35.197
Secondly, there's no such thing as too many boxes.

00:35.701 --> 00:39.803
And number three, there's no such thing as too many boxes.

00:40.198 --> 00:44.154
Seriously, packing is a breeze when everything is in a box.

00:44.393 --> 00:46.933
Now, don't pay for them at the car rental place.

00:47.409 --> 00:49.365
Get them from stores who are recycling them.

00:49.722 --> 00:50.546
Here's a pro tip.

00:51.083 --> 00:54.292
Liquor stores have perfect boxes for protecting glasses.

00:54.709 --> 00:57.062
Start collecting weeks before you have to move,...

00:57.411 --> 01:00.987
...and stop at every recycling bin that might contain a good score.

01:01.573 --> 01:03.057
Now, pack everything up...

01:03.374 --> 01:06.168
...and get that move done in an hour instead of ten.

01:06.617 --> 01:07.903
Your friends will thank you.
