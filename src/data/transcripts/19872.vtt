If you do anything creative like program or design or write,...

00:04.495 --> 00:08.253
...you know that it's hard to keep your creative energy up and stay focused.

00:08.531 --> 00:11.513
Something as simple as a meeting scheduled here...

00:11.684 --> 00:13.923
...will break your afternoon into two pieces...

00:14.025 --> 00:16.413
...which are both too small to do anything creative in.

00:16.652 --> 00:18.037
And the rest of your day is blown.

00:18.321 --> 00:22.229
When you know your entire day is free, you soar like a creative eagle;...

00:22.553 --> 00:25.411
...yet people are constantly asking to get things scheduled in,...

00:25.863 --> 00:28.691
...even when those meetings are not important to what you're creating.

00:29.161 --> 00:32.093
What you need to do is plan your day like a maker.

00:32.652 --> 00:34.852
You see, managers rule the world...

00:35.185 --> 00:37.163
...and they go from meeting to meeting no sweat.
