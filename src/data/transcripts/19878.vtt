00:08.897 --> 00:11.995
The world is using the equivalent of one and a half planets...

00:12.249 --> 00:13.825
...to support life on Earth.

00:16.554 --> 00:19.473
Earth Hour was born out of a hope that this could change.

00:27.051 --> 00:28.255
People are turning out their lights...

00:28.407 --> 00:32.304
...to signal their concern about the future of our life on this Earth.

00:52.284 --> 00:55.002
Introducing "I Will If You Will":...

00:55.789 --> 00:58.768
...taking the passion of Earth Hour beyond the hour.

00:59.717 --> 01:04.357
If 5,000 people agree to take public transportation instead of their cars for one week,...

01:04.869 --> 01:07.755
...we'll climb 96 stories of this building.

01:07.854 --> 01:09.691
I will conduct a free yoga class...

01:09.811 --> 01:13.340
...if 500 people upload their own "I Will If You Will" challenge.

01:13.445 --> 01:19.425
I will be dyeing this beard green if 10,000 people commit to supporting Earth Hour.

01:31.098 --> 01:33.131
It's the one thing that we all share is the place that we live.

01:33.503 --> 01:35.073
It's kind of common sense to look after it.

01:46.565 --> 01:51.923
Together, we can find the energy to turn the inspiration of one hour...

01:52.589 --> 01:55.017
...into the actions of every hour.
