00:13.425 --> 00:16.510
We've got a full load of salads,...

00:17.171 --> 00:24.035
...and that's lettuces, radishes, onions, spring onions, and Chinese lettuces.

00:37.661 --> 00:39.657
In this room, it is our operation centre.

00:39.891 --> 00:45.189
The map on the wall is a tracking system that we use on our vehicles.

00:45.917 --> 00:49.553
It shows us where they are, it updates at every ninety seconds...

00:49.653 --> 00:53.082
...and we use it to make sure that we are running to schedule.

00:53.175 --> 00:55.400
If there's any problems, we then inform the customer,...

00:56.640 --> 01:00.778
...and if we have any problems, say with a breakdown or traffic issues,...

01:00.863 --> 01:04.325
...we use it to locate the vehicle and see which ones can help...

01:04.464 --> 01:07.445
...or to direct vehicles around any problems.

01:09.483 --> 01:13.534
That shows our current delivery on time status for our main customers.

01:14.144 --> 01:18.672
The main customer we do from this site is supermarket destination Tesco's,...

01:18.749 --> 01:19.829
...so we show that separately,...

01:20.551 --> 01:23.843
...but we also show a separate set of figures for all the other work that's done...

01:23.981 --> 01:25.609
...within this part of the operation.

01:26.075 --> 01:32.283
So that the guys can focus making sure we achieve at least ninety percent delivery on time.

01:32.436 --> 01:35.858
Which doesn't sound that much but that doesn't take into account...

01:35.952 --> 01:40.281
...any road problems, any breakdowns, any of that comes out of our ten percent.

01:42.135 --> 01:44.369
One little accident causes us a lot of problems.

01:46.179 --> 01:50.111
Basically, from this site here we operate all the temperature-controlled trailers.

01:50.192 --> 01:50.833
We control them.

01:50.918 --> 01:53.348
There is about 440.

01:54.140 --> 01:56.661
We utilise them through our other sites, throughout the country...

01:56.740 --> 01:58.573
...that also work on the same operation.

01:58.665 --> 02:05.402
But any information that is put into any of our traffic management systems feeds onto that board,...

02:05.507 --> 02:10.015
...it shows what vehicle, what trailers are available, which ones are due for service,...

02:10.103 --> 02:13.921
...which ones are released and due for service shortly.
