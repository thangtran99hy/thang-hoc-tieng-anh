Hi, I'm Jessica Alba.

00:07.140 --> 00:08.095
I'm Christopher Gavigan.

00:08.151 --> 00:08.707
I'm Brian Lee.

00:08.813 --> 00:09.635
And I'm Sean Kane.

00:09.971 --> 00:12.154
Together, we are the founders of The Honest Company.

00:12.551 --> 00:15.258
And we believe that the simplest of actions can have a big impact.

00:15.629 --> 00:20.197
So please join us in our "I Will If You Will" challenge for Earth Hour 2013.

00:20.358 --> 00:24.504
So here it is: If 10,000 of you pledge to use nontoxic products in your home,...

00:24.691 --> 00:28.227
...we will let our kids dress all Honest employees for the day.

00:28.285 --> 00:30.721
And you know how creative kids can get with dress-up.

00:31.119 --> 00:34.795
And as parents, we believe that we have the responsibility to safeguard our children's future...

00:35.005 --> 00:37.970
...by creating the safest and most sustainable environment for them.

00:38.314 --> 00:42.579
You could learn more about our story and join the conversation by visiting Honest.com.

00:42.869 --> 00:45.781
And don't forget to turn off your lights for Earth Hour...

00:45.882 --> 00:49.921
...on Saturday, March 23rd, 2013 at 8:30 PM.

00:50.572 --> 00:52.805
Together, we can make it better.
