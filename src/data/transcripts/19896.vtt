If we start acting now on climate change,...

00:03.823 --> 00:06.121
...then we can still be in for a bright future.

00:06.838 --> 00:11.571
But it is important that each and everyone of us continues to fight against climate change...

00:11.877 --> 00:13.211
...and what it does to our world.

00:14.173 --> 00:18.625
When I travel, I see many original, innovative,...

00:18.726 --> 00:21.367
...smart climate solutions in every member state.

00:21.874 --> 00:23.989
They are put in place by innovative people,...

00:24.447 --> 00:27.988
...who just happen to have a great idea which saves greenhouse gas emissions...

00:28.357 --> 00:30.113
...and at the same time money.

00:30.935 --> 00:37.107
To encourage all the innovators amongst you, I've just launched a Europe-wide contest...

00:37.181 --> 00:41.131
...as part of "A World You Like with the Climate You Like" campaign.

00:41.920 --> 00:46.819
I'm looking for the best solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, big or small.

00:47.387 --> 00:50.758
Whether you are an individual or an organization.

00:51.296 --> 00:55.860
Because the engagement of every single one of us counts.

00:56.341 --> 01:00.609
Because the actions of every single one of us will make the difference.

01:01.347 --> 01:04.222
For a start, you can turn off your lights.

01:06.536 --> 01:10.361
This certainly is not the solution, but it is a reminder...

01:10.779 --> 01:13.751
...and a good opportunity for you to stop and think.

01:14.447 --> 01:17.757
So, I would like to invite you to participate in Earth Hour...

01:18.100 --> 01:20.918
...for one hour on Saturday, the 23rd of March,...

01:21.159 --> 01:23.061
...starting at 8:30 in the evening.

01:23.577 --> 01:26.761
You will have time to think about what you can do...

01:27.178 --> 01:30.316
...to secure a world you like with the climate you like.
