ï»¿When it comes down to the expertise of running transport operations,...

00:10.056 --> 00:18.637
...I think then it comes down to you need the right people, coupled with the right IT systems...

00:19.397 --> 00:26.453
...to run that and find the optimum solution and understand the logic behind it.

00:26.516 --> 00:35.071
So I mean when we started, we looked for people with mathematical ability in the transport office,...

00:36.247 --> 00:39.641
...actually making decisions as to what's the right thing to do.

00:39.723 --> 00:45.001
So they were able to have an understanding, they have some ability to think logically.

00:45.333 --> 00:48.851
You tend to find the guys actually really enjoy it.

00:50.121 --> 00:53.461
There's a sense of achievement at the end of the day, when you've come in in the morning,...

00:54.201 --> 00:59.999
...the A14 is closed, you've got all these suppliers that are chasing where the vehicles are.

01:00.316 --> 01:04.571
And you're having to change your plan around live time, on the day, because things have gone wrong.

01:05.018 --> 01:06.856
Once you have actually made all those changes...

01:06.923 --> 01:10.061
...and at the end of the day the plan has then still been finished,...

01:10.196 --> 01:13.200
...you have got all the deliveries made, everything is done and dusted,...

01:13.363 --> 01:16.445
...you get a sense of achievement when you go home in the evening that it was a good day.

01:17.105 --> 01:21.132
You wouldn't want it every day but, yeah, it is very challenging.

01:21.729 --> 01:24.043
Well, once you are on the road you are your own boss,...

01:24.522 --> 01:30.359
...and then you make all decisions of how you're going to get from A to B.

01:32.669 --> 01:34.225
And that's what I like about it.

01:36.150 --> 01:40.745
And you just seem to be so free in what you want to do.

01:41.150 --> 01:44.716
You haven't got the pressure once you get going,...

01:45.921 --> 01:49.177
...only when you get caught with traffic, that's the only thing.
