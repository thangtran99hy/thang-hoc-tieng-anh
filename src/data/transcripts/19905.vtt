PowerPoint or any other program like that...

00:05.719 --> 00:08.910
...is one of the big problems that people have.

00:09.591 --> 00:12.407
So often I've heard people say, "This is my presentation,"...

00:12.811 --> 00:15.302
...and they show me this big stack of slides.

00:15.691 --> 00:16.953
That's not your presentation.

00:17.267 --> 00:18.947
You are the presentation.

00:19.178 --> 00:20.829
Those are just visual aids.

00:21.791 --> 00:23.543
When we work with people at Benjamin Ball Associates...

00:23.649 --> 00:26.382
...we often take away their PowerPoint to start with,...

00:26.949 --> 00:30.729
...get them to deliver their presentation, just them talking,...

00:31.076 --> 00:35.605
...and then afterwards, then we introduce the visual aids.

00:36.064 --> 00:39.746
So if you've got a speech coming up, or a talk or a presentation coming up,...

00:39.922 --> 00:42.388
...the worst thing you can do is switch on PowerPoint.

00:42.887 --> 00:46.242
Get a blank sheet of paper, plan what you're going to say,...

00:46.668 --> 00:48.860
...and then the very last thing you do is think,...

00:49.227 --> 00:53.901
..."What visual aids can I use to help me get my point across?"

00:54.428 --> 01:00.902
If you want an example of really bad use of PowerPoint, just go to any conference.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.531
Just sit there for a while,...

01:02.981 --> 01:06.754
...and very quickly you will see how not to do it.

01:07.039 --> 01:12.162
And if you're lucky you might get one or two speakers in a day who got it right.

01:12.481 --> 01:16.565
Your job, if you're trying to do something, is to emulate that one or two.

01:17.175 --> 01:20.227
Don't fall into the trap of producing lots of PowerPoint.
