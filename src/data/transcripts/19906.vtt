ï»¿Here's a tip for you.

00:06.031 --> 00:08.381
Don't use white backgrounds.

00:08.947 --> 00:13.205
If you've ever taken a walk through a park and seen a glint of a gum wrapper off in the distance,...

00:13.333 --> 00:18.514
...or more likely today a beer can, and been completely distracted, you're gonna understand this.

00:19.125 --> 00:21.241
We see it light, not dark.

00:21.618 --> 00:26.112
In fact, we have 128 million rods and cones in each eye...

00:26.645 --> 00:28.711
...and that's what they do, they look for light.

00:29.339 --> 00:32.753
When light hits them, they send electric currents to the brain.

00:33.323 --> 00:35.496
More light produces more electric current.

00:36.119 --> 00:40.453
So think about the last time you tried to stare at a bright, glaring light.

00:41.064 --> 00:43.459
After a short time, it's really tiring.

00:43.980 --> 00:45.571
Too much electric current to the brain.

00:46.363 --> 00:48.897
Now think about the presentation situation:...

00:49.643 --> 00:53.507
...a semidark room with a projector shooting bright light...

00:53.902 --> 00:57.547
...onto a reflective screen and back into the eyes of the audience.

00:58.934 --> 01:01.050
Electric current to the brain like crazy.

01:01.655 --> 01:07.803
After a half hour of looking into white light, your audience is gonna look like this.

01:09.343 --> 01:14.695
Do this experiment: create a slide with black text on a white background...

01:15.197 --> 01:21.669
...then have your audience look at it, then reverse it and listen to the sigh of relief.

01:22.723 --> 01:27.105
Bright white reflected light is distracting, there's no two ways about it.

01:27.231 --> 01:29.312
In fact, it's electrifying.

01:29.854 --> 01:32.645
I call white backgrounds, "white death."

01:33.476 --> 01:34.083
Don't go there.
