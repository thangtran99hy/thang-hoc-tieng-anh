00:02.514 --> 00:04.075
How's this for sun and fun?

00:04.285 --> 00:08.511
At least 15,000 sharks are swimming off the South Florida coast,...

00:08.665 --> 00:12.069
...just in time for the annual influx of spring breakers.

00:12.265 --> 00:16.365
The huge migration of blacktip and spinner sharks is happening later this year,...

00:16.460 --> 00:19.319
...putting the sharks at odds with the vacationing crowds.

00:19.476 --> 00:23.560
Researchers estimate that tourists brave enough to swim in the waters near the migration...

00:23.629 --> 00:27.445
...are on average just 60 feet away from travelling sharks.

00:27.623 --> 00:31.222
Some beaches are on high alert, but of course the risk remains low.

00:31.450 --> 00:36.715
Blacktip and spinner sharks only account for about 25% of annual attacks on Florida...

00:36.835 --> 00:40.931
...and just 26 attacks were recorded there last year, none of them fatal.

00:41.077 --> 00:44.161
Still, you can imagine some revelers aren't quite convinced...

00:44.240 --> 00:46.299
...that it's safe to go back in the water.
