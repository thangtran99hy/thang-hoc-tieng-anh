00:02.569 --> 00:03.779
Oh, it's my wife.

00:03.994 --> 00:05.131
You got to answer this for me.

00:05.244 --> 00:06.101
Tell her I'm not here.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.330
I can't do that.

00:07.487 --> 00:08.445
Tell her we're working late.

00:08.704 --> 00:09.898
We don't work together.

00:10.011 --> 00:11.360
Tell her you cast me on a movie.

00:11.435 --> 00:12.077
A movie?

00:12.699 --> 00:13.671
Do you even act?

00:13.797 --> 00:15.355
What kind of part would you play?

00:15.485 --> 00:16.891
I don't know, leading man?

00:16.976 --> 00:19.116
I don't see you as the leading man type.

00:19.208 --> 00:23.543
Wait, how about a hard-boiled police detective with a chip on his shoulder?

00:23.919 --> 00:24.333
Fine.

00:24.509 --> 00:25.898
Or no, I've got it.

00:26.393 --> 00:29.472
A quiet bus driver with a shady past he keeps to himself...

00:29.748 --> 00:31.970
...until one day he has to stand up for what he believes in.

00:32.056 --> 00:32.623
Answer it!

00:32.893 --> 00:33.418
No, no, I've got it.

00:33.893 --> 00:37.327
A former basketball star who saves his alma mater from the wrecking ball...

00:37.408 --> 00:40.546
...by doing the one other thing he loves: party clown.

00:41.978 --> 00:42.270
No!

00:42.579 --> 00:45.001
An ex-basketball star who's abducted by aliens...

00:45.243 --> 00:48.751
...and leads a ragtag team of Martians to the intergalactic championship!

00:49.589 --> 00:50.211
Give me that phone.

00:51.287 --> 00:53.308
Charles, give me that phone.
