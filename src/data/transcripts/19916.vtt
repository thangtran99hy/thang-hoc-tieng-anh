00:02.571 --> 00:02.947
Kara.

00:03.218 --> 00:04.577
It was only a couple of months ago.

00:04.794 --> 00:05.229
Tell me.

00:10.529 --> 00:11.334
We were helpless.

00:11.793 --> 00:15.617
Our army threw everything we had at them, but they were unstoppable.

00:20.372 --> 00:21.219
No!

00:24.634 --> 00:25.595
You've seen these before?

00:25.683 --> 00:26.307
A lot of them.

00:26.424 --> 00:26.952
On Krypton?

00:27.057 --> 00:29.561
In Kandor, the capital; the day it disappeared.

00:30.185 --> 00:31.642
A whole city disappeared?

00:33.648 --> 00:35.085
It calls itself Brainiac.

00:35.154 --> 00:37.009
I am flesh and machine.

00:38.108 --> 00:41.269
I am the strength of 10,000 worlds.

00:43.269 --> 00:45.442
These probes must be how he searches for planets.

00:45.516 --> 00:48.525
If that thing is here, it's all going to happen again.

00:48.705 --> 00:50.097
No, we can beat him.

00:50.683 --> 00:52.837
Millions of lives; they all need to be freed.

00:53.031 --> 00:53.443
Go!

00:53.737 --> 00:55.110
You have already failed.

00:57.917 --> 00:59.897
Soon, Earth will be mine.

00:59.973 --> 01:00.947
We'll see about that.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.851
Such a savage world.

01:05.095 --> 01:06.530
It gives me strength.

01:11.244 --> 01:12.251
Welcome to Earth.
