It's working, fully operational and human words are coming out.

00:13.729 --> 00:14.043
Hi!

00:14.847 --> 00:15.777
I'm Mr. Wolfdog.

00:16.659 --> 00:20.308
Old Spice was looking for someone to market their new wild collection of scents.

00:21.102 --> 00:23.497
Someone from the wild, and I guess that's me.

00:23.821 --> 00:26.538
Director Wolfdog, New Executive Director of Marketing.

00:27.214 --> 00:30.069
Did you notice I have this cliche businessman decorations?

00:30.785 --> 00:31.491
I have them to show...

00:31.595 --> 00:35.466
...I am definitely successful in business and definitely not just a wild animal.

00:36.257 --> 00:37.664
Also, look at this calculator.

00:38.063 --> 00:40.125
Would a dangerous wild animal use a calculator?

00:41.572 --> 00:42.229
I think not.

00:43.079 --> 00:45.045
You see, I fully understand marketing.

00:45.724 --> 00:47.497
Wild Collection Smell products.

00:47.706 --> 00:47.985
Boom!

00:48.394 --> 00:50.079
You've been seduced by my marketing.

00:51.125 --> 00:53.269
That's marketing that I just did to you,...

00:53.800 --> 00:55.979
...and it's how I get business done.

00:56.935 --> 00:57.933
Stamp, stamp, stamp!

00:58.536 --> 00:59.799
I just made a million dollars.

01:00.669 --> 01:01.391
That's what I just did.

01:01.890 --> 01:03.537
Bring in more business looking awards.

01:04.387 --> 01:05.048
Here's a tough one.

01:05.189 --> 01:06.607
How does a business leader resist...

01:06.679 --> 01:10.645
...the strong, stomach-oriented urge to eat his staff members?

01:13.336 --> 01:14.359
The hard fact is you don't.

01:14.971 --> 01:15.415
Where's John?

01:18.053 --> 01:19.781
Sometimes you got to eat people, America.

01:20.057 --> 01:21.339
That's how business works.

01:21.630 --> 01:23.653
And that's why I'm successful.

01:24.275 --> 01:28.344
Listen, my point is this, follow my twitters or read my blog writings...

01:28.433 --> 01:30.737
...because I'm about to make Old Spice Wild Collection...

01:30.867 --> 01:32.332
...the wildest brand in the world.

01:34.657 --> 01:35.181
You're welcome.

01:36.390 --> 01:37.702
Bring in the meat sacks!
