Cambridge Angels started back in about 2001.

00:15.737 --> 00:21.645
Those of you with long memories will remember this wasn't exactly the best time to start...

00:21.749 --> 00:24.885
...because shortly after that everything collapsed.

00:25.743 --> 00:28.913
But, there was a small group of people in Cambridge...

00:29.259 --> 00:34.223
...who had all made a reasonable amount of money by starting and selling companies.

00:34.729 --> 00:37.426
And that was enough to start a small group together,...

00:38.069 --> 00:41.619
...probably only about 12 or 15 in the first meeting,...

00:42.041 --> 00:48.505
...who then managed to get people coming to them with lots of ideas.

00:48.881 --> 00:51.104
And gradually over the next three or four years,...

00:51.471 --> 00:55.773
...Cambridge Angels became quite an interesting and important organisation.

00:56.023 --> 01:02.664
We have grown from those initial dozen or so people to around about 45.

01:03.791 --> 01:08.180
We invest something between two and three million pounds per year.

01:08.667 --> 01:12.754
And at the moment we have two very large deals going on,...

01:13.099 --> 01:16.309
...which together amount to nearly two million pounds of investment.
