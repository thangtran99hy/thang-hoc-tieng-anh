00:15.694 --> 00:16.664
It is a one-year MBA.

00:17.156 --> 00:21.176
It is distinct from the two-year MBAs, which is the normal model in the States.

00:22.117 --> 00:25.109
It is a pedagogical model which works very well...

00:25.235 --> 00:30.695
...because the students we have tend to be somewhat older, so the average age is 30, 31,...

00:30.859 --> 00:34.372
...so people need at least five years of experience before they come to us.

00:35.695 --> 00:40.133
The normal model is one in which they are highly talented, high calibre people...

00:40.719 --> 00:42.097
...often from blue-chip organisations...

00:42.925 --> 00:45.567
...but who have been specialising up to that point in their career,...

00:46.505 --> 00:50.409
...and they need to develop more general management skills in order to move to the next level.

00:51.235 --> 00:55.092
And effectively, the MBA is a very intensive crash course...

00:55.208 --> 00:58.229
...in getting that very general base in management and leadership.
