00:10.708 --> 00:12.093
This is what a hundred million buys, huh?

00:15.437 --> 00:16.994
It wasn't that hard to find you, Toretto.

00:17.581 --> 00:18.173
I wasn't hiding.

00:19.949 --> 00:25.597
Last week, a team of highly coordinated drivers took down an entire military convoy.

00:28.053 --> 00:29.745
You're going to help me catch the team responsible.

00:29.934 --> 00:30.689
And why is that?

00:31.391 --> 00:33.237
I've been chasing this crew across 12 countries.

00:34.773 --> 00:35.755
This was taken a week ago.

00:39.701 --> 00:40.499
It's impossible.

00:41.106 --> 00:42.023
I need your help, Dom.

00:42.779 --> 00:43.497
I need your team.

00:47.857 --> 00:50.283
You got the best crew in the world standing right in front of you.

00:51.801 --> 00:52.953
Give them a reason to stay.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.216
Our target is Owen Shaw.

00:55.801 --> 00:57.461
For years, he's been running jobs in Europe.

00:57.850 --> 01:00.503
But the most recent job has graduated them to a whole new level.

01:05.450 --> 01:06.994
You get us close to Letty and we'll give you Shaw.

01:07.157 --> 01:08.905
And you give us full pardons all the way around.

01:09.980 --> 01:10.882
That's the deal.

01:11.293 --> 01:11.965
Take it or leave it.

01:17.931 --> 01:18.683
Ride to die.

01:22.018 --> 01:23.871
We're not dealing with cops or drug dealers.

01:23.949 --> 01:24.891
I've never seen this before.

01:26.015 --> 01:27.315
This code you live by...

01:27.957 --> 01:28.679
...makes you predictable.

01:30.203 --> 01:32.401
I can reach out and break you whenever I want to.

01:35.034 --> 01:35.920
You believe in ghosts?

01:39.810 --> 01:41.301
Maybe the Letty we once knew is gone.

01:41.950 --> 01:43.336
You don't turn your back on family,...

01:44.363 --> 01:45.502
...even when they do.

01:57.169 --> 01:57.791
Guys,...

01:58.790 --> 01:59.431
...they got a tank.

01:59.735 --> 02:00.169
Damn.

02:03.112 --> 02:04.737
We're talking vehicular warfare.

02:06.243 --> 02:07.310
This is not what we do.
