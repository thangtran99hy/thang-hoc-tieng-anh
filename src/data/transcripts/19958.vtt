00:07.461 --> 00:10.397
Easter, the holiest day of the Christian calendar.

00:10.763 --> 00:13.861
A celebration of Jesus Christ's Resurrection from the dead.

00:15.332 --> 00:19.079
So what does this miracle have to do with a bunny delivering painted eggs?

00:19.523 --> 00:23.051
The answer lies in a hundred generations of rituals and customs.

00:23.650 --> 00:25.519
According to the Gospels of the New Testament,...

00:25.796 --> 00:29.483
...Jesus Christ and his apostles entered Jerusalem to observe Passover,...

00:29.975 --> 00:33.357
...the Jewish holy season that celebrates the Hebrews' release from slavery.

00:34.211 --> 00:36.726
After the Passover supper, Jesus was arrested...

00:37.311 --> 00:40.375
...and on what is now called Good Friday, he was crucified.

00:41.263 --> 00:43.201
Two days later, he rose from the dead.

00:44.077 --> 00:47.202
Those of Jewish origin were the first to celebrate the Resurrection,...

00:47.703 --> 00:50.147
...likely as a new facet of the Passover festival.

00:50.628 --> 00:53.429
In fact, the Easter celebration was called Pascha.

00:53.971 --> 00:58.155
It's derived from the word Pesach, the Jewish translation for Passover.

00:59.976 --> 01:05.375
Originally, Easter was celebrated two days after Passover, so it fell on any day of the week.

01:05.881 --> 01:08.068
But "Easter Wednesday" just didn't feel right.

01:09.123 --> 01:13.903
In 325 A.D., Roman emperor Constantine and the Council of Nicaea...

01:14.257 --> 01:18.649
...ruled that Easter must fall only on a Sunday, the day when Christ rose.

01:19.366 --> 01:23.842
Easter Sunday would be the first Sunday to follow the full moon after the spring equinox.

01:24.189 --> 01:27.303
It could occur anywhere between March 22nd and April 25th.

01:28.886 --> 01:30.181
Around this same time...

01:30.539 --> 01:34.835
...Christians began one of the first recorded rituals of the modern Easter celebration:...

01:35.275 --> 01:36.927
...the lighting of the Paschal candle.

01:37.302 --> 01:41.474
Its flame, a reminder of Christ's Resurrection, light out of darkness.

01:41.949 --> 01:43.861
As Christianity spread throughout Europe,...

01:44.334 --> 01:46.978
...different pagan customs blended into the holidays.

01:47.311 --> 01:50.847
In fact, the actual word Easter may have come from Eostre,...

01:51.117 --> 01:52.841
...the goddess of spring and fertility.

01:53.421 --> 01:54.923
Which brings us to the Easter egg.

01:56.897 --> 02:00.307
Eggs have been a mythological symbol of birth for thousands of years.

02:00.857 --> 02:05.128
Christians adopted the egg as an Easter custom sometime around the 13th century.

02:05.661 --> 02:09.161
The yolk inside a shell represented Christ's emergence from the tomb.

02:09.716 --> 02:13.310
Eggs were painted red to represent the blood Christ shed on the cross.

02:14.872 --> 02:17.715
The colorful Easter eggs soon hatched its own traditions.

02:18.223 --> 02:19.960
A popular one was egg rolling.

02:21.059 --> 02:25.753
In 1876, Congress prohibited kids from playing on the Capitol grounds.

02:26.169 --> 02:30.823
So President Rutherford B. Hayes opened the White House lawn to the little rollers.

02:31.447 --> 02:34.407
After that, the White House Easter Egg Roll became a tradition.

02:35.427 --> 02:37.783
So when did that Easter bunny hop into the scene?

02:38.664 --> 02:43.585
The fertile rabbit had long been a symbol of new life in European pagan celebrations.

02:43.985 --> 02:48.415
Beginning around the 16th century, parents told children that if they behaved,...

02:48.637 --> 02:52.725
...on the eve of Easter the Osterhase would come and lay colorful eggs.

02:53.373 --> 02:56.575
Children built nests in their homes to entice the rabbit to visit.

02:57.211 --> 03:00.985
And so began the customs of the Easter egg hunt and the Easter basket.

03:02.195 --> 03:03.925
To help fill out those baskets,...

03:04.041 --> 03:08.541
...19th century European chocolatiers began making egg shaped chocolates.

03:08.760 --> 03:11.019
The sweet trend quickly spread throughout the world.

03:11.412 --> 03:15.083
Today, billions of dollars are spent each year on Easter candy.

03:17.248 --> 03:21.089
Easter: it's a joyful day when Christians celebrate the Resurrection.

03:21.698 --> 03:26.165
For 2,000 years, customs have been at it, some spiritual and some fun.

03:27.287 --> 03:30.853
But Easter is also the time for families to gather and welcome spring,...

03:31.333 --> 03:33.821
...when new life emerges after the dead of winter.
