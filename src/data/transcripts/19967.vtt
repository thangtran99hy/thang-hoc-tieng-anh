My god.

00:15.351 --> 00:16.501
He's got a voice of an angel.

00:16.575 --> 00:17.311
It's breathtaking.

00:31.143 --> 00:33.263
I told myself I would never come back.

00:34.750 --> 00:36.250
Don't worry, it all ends tonight.

00:38.019 --> 00:40.793
Someone needs to burn this place to the ground.

00:42.371 --> 00:42.926
I like that!

01:19.371 --> 01:20.977
We've been in a lot of adventures together.

01:21.220 --> 01:22.777
But it seems like you haven't learned anything.

01:23.859 --> 01:24.259
Anything.

01:25.149 --> 01:25.672
I'll be in the limo.

01:34.002 --> 01:36.071
My name's Alan and I bought a giraffe.

01:36.804 --> 01:38.555
Oh, my life is great!
