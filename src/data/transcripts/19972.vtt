If you want to make sure that your food is safe and fresh and good for you,...

00:19.877 --> 00:24.575
...I think the number one awesome thing you can do is go to your local farmer's market.

00:25.230 --> 00:26.181
I just think that's key.

00:26.553 --> 00:32.703
I think it's one of the things that really can make a huge impact on helping the world right now.

00:33.189 --> 00:36.432
But I get it's difficult too because organic food costs more.

00:37.576 --> 00:41.194
When you go to your farmer's market, you're actually getting it directly from the farm.

00:41.285 --> 00:44.305
You don't have those costs that are put on that are at a supermarket.

00:44.503 --> 00:45.706
It's something that you should really look out for.

00:45.845 --> 00:50.730
Don't just go for the organic apple you see because it could be grown in New Zealand.

00:50.841 --> 00:55.389
And does it really make sense to buy an organic apple from New Zealand?

00:57.278 --> 00:58.018
I don't think so.
