00:03.237 --> 00:05.152
Well, the show is called "Around the World in 80 Plates."

00:05.289 --> 00:07.891
We're going around the world in 80 plates.

00:09.073 --> 00:14.271
12 chefs are about to embark on a culinary adventure of over 60,000 miles.

00:14.371 --> 00:17.702
They're cooking in a foreign place, a foreign cuisine, serving it to the locals.

00:17.847 --> 00:21.100
The locals decide who did a better job of the overall experience,...

00:21.187 --> 00:23.781
...interpreting the local cuisine, the service, the food, of course.

00:23.918 --> 00:26.090
So Cat and I deliver that news, a little bit of fun.

00:26.685 --> 00:29.923
And then Cat and I also decide who we thought was the most valuable chef.

00:30.066 --> 00:34.349
So we give that person an award, which is immunity in the next city that they move directly on to.

00:34.417 --> 00:35.097
Hello, chefs!

00:35.309 --> 00:35.973
Welcome to London!

00:38.053 --> 00:40.572
And welcome to "Around the World in 80 Plates."

00:40.675 --> 00:43.271
We don't want Bravo to know how good a job this was, okay?

00:43.982 --> 00:45.652
We're going to ask for more money for Season Two.

00:45.720 --> 00:46.190
Exactly.

00:46.323 --> 00:48.218
It was tough, rigorous.

00:48.525 --> 00:49.871
We had to travel a lot.

00:50.506 --> 00:53.025
And we're away from our families for long periods of time.

00:53.231 --> 00:53.601
Horrible.

00:54.431 --> 00:55.259
Horrible conditions!

00:55.583 --> 00:55.907
Very tough.

00:56.193 --> 00:56.849
Very tough for us.

00:56.928 --> 00:57.439
Very hard job.

00:57.613 --> 00:57.889
Very hard.

00:58.005 --> 00:59.263
We got to travel the world.

00:59.413 --> 01:03.813
Of course, we saw the most amazing sites and got to see this incredible competition...

01:03.895 --> 01:06.174
...unfold right under our noses and be a part of it.

01:06.299 --> 01:08.646
We literally watched it, tasted and smelled it.

01:08.888 --> 01:09.571
It was a dream job.

01:09.993 --> 01:10.291
Dream job.

01:10.443 --> 01:10.775
Okay, you got me.
