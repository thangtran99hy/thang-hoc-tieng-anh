Advances in genealogical DNA testing have raised existential questions for many,...

00:05.156 --> 00:08.063
...but not much compares to the experience of Albert Perry,...

00:08.265 --> 00:12.300
...whose genetic material offers new clues about the origin of the human species.

00:12.715 --> 00:15.012
An African-American man from South Carolina,...

00:15.264 --> 00:18.096
...Perry let a relative send in his DNA for analysis.

00:18.497 --> 00:22.458
But when the testing company tried to track his Y chromosome, they simply couldn't.

00:22.820 --> 00:25.162
Further research reveal that Perry's Y chromosome...

00:25.230 --> 00:30.135
...came from a lineage that broke off from other species about 338,000 years ago.

00:30.376 --> 00:36.664
That's long before the first Homo Sapiens or modern humans evolved some 195,000 years ago,...

00:36.943 --> 00:40.821
...making our Y chromosome lineage much longer than geneticists believed.

00:41.040 --> 00:45.124
Researchers eventually linked Perry's DNA to other men in a village in Cameroon,...

00:45.401 --> 00:47.588
...leading them to speculate that modern humans...

00:47.687 --> 00:52.572
...and a since extinct species interbred in Central Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago.
