ï»¿Cracked iPhone screens may soon become a thing of the past.

00:03.360 --> 00:05.996
Apple has filed a patent for a series of components...

00:06.075 --> 00:09.427
...that can detect your iPhone's orientation when it's falling midair,...

00:09.686 --> 00:11.063
...and change its center of mass...

00:11.144 --> 00:14.333
...to ensure your screen doesn't shatter when the phone hits the ground.

00:14.658 --> 00:17.897
It could, for example, rotate the phone on its back every time.

00:18.163 --> 00:20.439
After you drop your phone and it's in free fall,...

00:20.745 --> 00:23.300
...gyroscopes, image sensors and accelerometers...

00:23.389 --> 00:25.686
...would calculate how fast your phone is falling,...

00:25.999 --> 00:28.569
...how far it is from the ground and other reference points.

00:28.969 --> 00:33.903
Hopelessly clumsy people worldwide will be overjoyed if Apple implements the technology,...

00:34.170 --> 00:37.901
...because they know firsthand that the cost of fixing a broken iPhone screen...

00:37.971 --> 00:39.862
...can be as much as the phone itself.
