00:00.326 --> 00:01.072
Alright, guys!

00:01.388 --> 00:05.703
"Unicorn Apocalypse" promises to be the biggest mobile game we've ever launched.

00:05.789 --> 00:06.173
Yes!

00:07.495 --> 00:09.729
We'd also like to announce a new smartphone policy.

00:09.859 --> 00:12.225
To make things simple, you can now use any phone you want at work.

00:12.545 --> 00:13.805
So you're finally gonna retire that thing?

00:14.236 --> 00:14.831
That's cute.

00:15.311 --> 00:16.860
You're not even working, you're watching basketball.

00:16.971 --> 00:19.520
Actually, I'm closing deals with clients and watching the game.

00:19.697 --> 00:20.981
Modern business, my friend.

00:21.513 --> 00:22.346
This is business.

00:22.679 --> 00:23.260
What, the jacket?

00:23.563 --> 00:25.001
Did you have the partners' Note 2's ready?

00:25.317 --> 00:26.213
Yep, here you go.

00:26.319 --> 00:26.884
All set up.

00:26.973 --> 00:27.396
Alright.

00:27.691 --> 00:29.077
Are you sure these are secure enough?

00:29.227 --> 00:34.261
These have on device AES 256-bit encryption plus support for VPN and NDM.

00:34.395 --> 00:37.707
Now we need to decide, did the unicorns start the apocalypse or are they trying to prevent it?

00:40.137 --> 00:41.987
What about you, are you gonna consolidate your phones?

00:42.411 --> 00:43.527
Oh, no, I have a system.

00:44.179 --> 00:46.228
This one is for work, this one is for home.

00:46.536 --> 00:47.629
Great, but with the GS3...

00:47.703 --> 00:49.652
Valerie, respect my system.

00:50.691 --> 00:50.891
Right.

00:51.273 --> 00:53.070
Yeah, I want it to look like a real unicorn.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.829
The way they look in real life.

00:55.029 --> 00:56.954
Okay, but real-life unicorns have rainbow blood.

00:57.555 --> 00:58.404
Got the new game trailer?

00:58.685 --> 00:59.103
Yeah.

01:00.149 --> 01:00.601
Hold still.

01:01.419 --> 01:03.188
Hey, what about glitter for the mane?

01:05.553 --> 01:07.990
Really like how the horn's decayed but still lethal.

01:08.684 --> 01:11.657
Oh, by the way guys, we're launching in four weeks.

01:11.819 --> 01:12.046
What?

01:12.165 --> 01:12.963
Four weeks people.

01:13.306 --> 01:14.397
No one is gonna sleep this month.

01:14.831 --> 01:17.139
I know a guy who can get us the Swedish energy drinks.

01:17.338 --> 01:18.115
The ones from Sweden?

01:18.309 --> 01:19.647
Oleg, it's Dave.

01:20.294 --> 01:20.848
It's go time.

01:21.904 --> 01:22.356
Oh boy.

01:22.847 --> 01:24.395
The next big thing for business is here.

01:24.919 --> 01:27.649
The Galaxy S3 and Note 2 with Safe Technology.
