00:00.075 --> 00:03.700
Finally, a use for that 20 million dollars stuffed in your couch.

00:04.057 --> 00:07.589
The world's largest known white diamond will go up for auction in Switzerland this week...

00:07.858 --> 00:12.823
...where it could eclipse the record 21.5 million paid for a colorless stone last year.

00:13.227 --> 00:19.328
The 101.73-carat pear shaped diamond was cultivated last year at Botswana's Jwaneng mine,...

00:19.701 --> 00:21.901
...co-owned by the government and De Beers.

00:22.260 --> 00:24.546
The stone took 21 months to polish.

00:24.733 --> 00:27.712
And the first-time buyer at the auction will be allowed to name it.

00:27.992 --> 00:29.296
Whatever the diamond earns...

00:29.474 --> 00:33.293
...the all-time record will likely remain with the much rarer colored diamond,...

00:33.573 --> 00:38.615
..."Fancy Intense Pink," which nabbed 45.6 million in 2010.

00:39.051 --> 00:42.109
For the peasants of the world without 20 million dollars tucked away,...

00:42.339 --> 00:46.395
...the diamond will go on tour in New York and Hong Kong after the auction.
