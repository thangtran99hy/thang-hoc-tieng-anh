00:00.497 --> 00:04.051
Our conscience: it's what helps us choose right from wrong,...

00:04.457 --> 00:08.037
...good from bad, and fair trade bananas from the rest.

00:08.802 --> 00:12.473
So to convince shoppers that All Good fair trade bananas were the way to go,...

00:12.942 --> 00:15.604
...we became their inner voice, literally.

00:16.410 --> 00:19.638
We used a new sound device called the audio spotlight.

00:20.336 --> 00:25.588
Unlike a regular speaker, the audio spotlight emits a narrow high frequency beam of sound.

00:26.173 --> 00:30.335
Because its audio is focused, it's heard by you and you alone.

00:30.972 --> 00:32.110
Like that voice in your head.

00:32.731 --> 00:35.668
We positioned this device over a floor sticker in a store,...

00:36.332 --> 00:39.973
...and when shoppers stood on it they heard their own private message.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.711
No one else heard a thing.

00:42.056 --> 00:42.775
Here's how it worked.

00:43.716 --> 00:45.866
Hi, you can hear me, can't you?

00:46.931 --> 00:47.570
You're the only one.

00:47.937 --> 00:48.333
Is it cool?

00:48.714 --> 00:50.433
Look around, no one else can.

00:51.448 --> 00:51.675
See?

00:52.739 --> 00:53.424
Know who I am?

00:54.401 --> 00:55.291
I'm that inner voice.

00:56.591 --> 00:58.019
I want to talk to you about something.

00:59.050 --> 00:59.583
Fair trade.

01:00.775 --> 01:04.357
Look at them all, those bananas in front of you; which should you buy?

01:05.415 --> 01:07.277
I know, and you do too.

01:08.106 --> 01:09.259
They're all good bananas.

01:10.115 --> 01:11.391
They're the only fair trade ones.

01:12.034 --> 01:15.008
So now you know which ones to choose, make a good choice.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.901
Man, it was so weird but it was real cool.

01:18.459 --> 01:21.151
It sounded like there was a voice actually in my head.

01:22.725 --> 01:24.151
I can't really explain it, it was awesome.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.681
Yeah, how did they do it?

01:25.989 --> 01:30.176
I know, it freaked me out a little bit, it felt like someone was inside my head.

01:31.201 --> 01:31.935
Can I go on it again?

01:32.919 --> 01:36.352
Over two weeks, thousands of shoppers listened to their conscience...

01:36.615 --> 01:39.672
...and All Good sales went up a hundred and thirty percent,...

01:40.198 --> 01:41.995
...which was all good.
