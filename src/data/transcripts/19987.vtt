ï»¿Irena Sendler was a Polish, Catholic nurse who worked in Warsaw...

00:09.167 --> 00:10.893
...during the Nazi occupation of Poland...

00:11.345 --> 00:15.297
...and saved 2,500 Jewish children from certain death.

00:16.032 --> 00:19.595
During that time, she worked for the Warsaw social services.

00:20.369 --> 00:22.363
After the creation of the Warsaw ghetto,...

00:22.880 --> 00:25.457
...Irena Sendler was able to save many children...

00:25.899 --> 00:30.085
...by smuggling them out of the ghetto to save them from being deported...

00:30.497 --> 00:31.855
...to the concentration camps.

00:32.709 --> 00:37.227
She transported the children in ambulances as if they were sick from typhus,...

00:37.735 --> 00:42.319
...hid them in the trash cans, tool chests, supply boxes or coffins,...

00:42.736 --> 00:45.946
...and later put them in convents and Polish Catholic families.

00:46.799 --> 00:50.719
She created an archive with the real identities of the children...

00:51.107 --> 00:54.987
...so one day they could be reunited with their family members.

00:55.645 --> 00:59.613
She wrote on a strip of paper the Jewish names of the children...

00:59.963 --> 01:03.832
...with the new Polish name and addresses where they were taken.

01:04.275 --> 01:08.720
All of them she put in a jar, which she buried by a tree in her garden.

01:09.631 --> 01:13.109
In 1943, she was detained by the Gestapo...

01:13.455 --> 01:16.922
...and taken to prison where she was brutally tortured.

01:17.301 --> 01:20.623
She never betrayed her mission and she was sentenced to death...

01:21.190 --> 01:25.665
...but a soldier freed her, thanks to the intervention from the Polish resistance.

01:26.488 --> 01:30.578
At the end of the war, she was able to recover her archives...

01:31.049 --> 01:36.594
...although most of the families of children she saved had died in concentration camps.

01:37.138 --> 01:41.949
In 1965, the organization Yad Vashem in Jerusalem...

01:42.256 --> 01:45.695
...granted her the title "Righteous Among the Nations".

01:46.607 --> 01:51.502
During the last year of her life, she received thanks from many children she had saved...

01:51.997 --> 01:54.503
...and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.
