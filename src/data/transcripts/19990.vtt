00:00.165 --> 00:02.459
I've been sitting here for nearly a minute without entertainment.

00:02.940 --> 00:04.491
Change the battery in the remote.

00:05.113 --> 00:05.893
The one on the left.

00:06.259 --> 00:07.289
The one on the left?

00:07.967 --> 00:09.124
Well, that's just spooky.

00:09.422 --> 00:09.935
Not really.

00:10.593 --> 00:11.545
I have the knack.

00:11.904 --> 00:12.366
The knack?

00:13.051 --> 00:13.995
For technology.

00:14.725 --> 00:15.984
My mom says I always have.

00:17.336 --> 00:19.013
I'm worried about little Dilbert.

00:19.487 --> 00:20.889
He's not like other kids.

00:21.386 --> 00:21.919
What do you mean?

00:22.333 --> 00:29.235
Yesterday, I left him alone for a minute and he disassembled the TV, our clock and the stereo.

00:29.702 --> 00:30.708
That's perfectly normal.

00:31.244 --> 00:32.323
Kids take things apart.

00:34.273 --> 00:39.159
The part that worries me is he used the components to build a ham radio set.

00:40.288 --> 00:40.879
Oh dear.

00:42.681 --> 00:43.598
Is that bad?

00:44.178 --> 00:47.717
Normally, I'd want to run an EEG on him but the machine isn't working.

00:52.651 --> 00:53.411
It's worse than I feared.

00:54.621 --> 00:55.179
What is it?

00:55.360 --> 00:57.939
I'm afraid your son has the knack.

00:59.291 --> 00:59.967
The knack?

01:00.760 --> 01:01.166
The knack.

01:01.492 --> 01:04.303
It's a rare condition characterized by an extreme intuition...

01:04.430 --> 01:06.334
...about all things mechanical and electrical.

01:07.003 --> 01:08.929
And utter social ineptitude.

01:09.499 --> 01:11.158
Can he lead a normal life?

01:11.876 --> 01:12.019
No.

01:12.934 --> 01:13.781
He'll be an engineer.

01:18.090 --> 01:18.419
There, there.

01:19.129 --> 01:19.913
Don't blame yourself.

01:20.376 --> 01:22.140
Will it go away over time?

01:22.495 --> 01:22.879
It might.

01:23.308 --> 01:23.949
But pray it doesn't.

01:24.878 --> 01:28.532
If an engineer loses the knack, the results can be devastating.

01:34.132 --> 01:37.861
Thanks for filling in for our regular doctor on such short notice.

01:38.277 --> 01:38.979
I was in the neighborhood.
