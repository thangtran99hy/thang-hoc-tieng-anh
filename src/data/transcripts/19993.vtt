Hi, this is Mat Bussler for About.com,...

00:03.411 --> 00:06.166
...and today we're going to be talking about what is an internship.

00:06.561 --> 00:10.761
An internship is a fantastic way for people to gain experience in a desired field.

00:11.207 --> 00:13.659
Basically, an internship is a form of job training...

00:13.831 --> 00:16.431
...usually reserved for newcomers in an organization.

00:17.153 --> 00:20.866
Assistant positions are one of the most common kinds of internship opportunities.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.777
Think of an internship as a kind of apprenticeship...

00:24.136 --> 00:26.305
...where you work alongside existing employees...

00:26.368 --> 00:28.570
...and do not compete for regular positions.

00:29.161 --> 00:31.149
There are many different types of internships.

00:31.327 --> 00:35.965
Some internships offer pay, though it is more often for them to be unpaid positions.

00:36.505 --> 00:38.936
Some internships offer benefits in lieu of pay,...

00:39.079 --> 00:41.145
...such as paid housing or college credit.

00:41.567 --> 00:44.948
Different states have different laws regarding internship compensation.

00:45.579 --> 00:48.217
Internships are generally not permanent positions.

00:48.439 --> 00:52.231
They exist for a summer or six months or some other set period of time.

00:52.542 --> 00:54.942
Internships tend to be very popular with college students...

00:55.034 --> 00:58.028
...because they can fit in the opportunity during a break or a hiatus.

00:58.365 --> 01:00.462
Summer internships tend to be the most popular.

01:01.007 --> 01:04.697
Interns do not necessarily expect a job at the conclusion of their internship.

01:05.205 --> 01:07.375
Besides gaining hands-on job experience,...

01:07.460 --> 01:11.535
...another huge benefit of internships is networking contacts and business associates.

01:11.971 --> 01:15.476
Interns are able to build relationships that help them hit the job market running.

01:15.945 --> 01:18.149
Many different kinds of industries offer internships,...

01:18.356 --> 01:21.009
...from financial institutions to government facilities.

01:21.208 --> 01:24.440
And they also exist in volunteer and non-profit organizations.

01:24.995 --> 01:27.149
Internships are most common among college students,...

01:27.235 --> 01:30.340
...though there are also opportunities for students as young as high school age.

01:30.662 --> 01:31.415
Thanks for watching.
