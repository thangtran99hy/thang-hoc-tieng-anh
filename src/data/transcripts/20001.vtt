00:03.478 --> 00:07.890
For five years during the Second World War, a group of young Polish women,...

00:08.210 --> 00:11.526
...some barely out of their teens, outfoxed the Nazis.

00:13.187 --> 00:15.943
They saved the lives of thousands of Jewish children,...

00:16.395 --> 00:19.264
...smuggling them out of the Warsaw ghetto to safety.

00:20.572 --> 00:28.589
Any Jew that was caught with a non-Jew, the non-Jew's family and himself were killed.

00:29.356 --> 00:29.865
On the spot.

00:35.616 --> 00:37.069
This is Irena Sendler.

00:38.653 --> 00:40.995
Few people outside Poland have heard of her.

00:55.805 --> 01:01.051
After the war, these women were silenced by the Communist authorities.

01:07.661 --> 01:09.463
Now their story can be told.

01:13.267 --> 01:22.289
I sit here as a testament to those people who were committed to saving a Jewish child's life.
