There are many ways to deal with a close-minded boss.

00:03.599 --> 00:06.120
Some are right and some are simply wrong.

00:06.902 --> 00:08.974
Here are three things you should avoid doing.

00:09.406 --> 00:14.625
Number one: Don't ignore your boss as this will only emphasize a lack of interest and respect...

00:14.864 --> 00:17.236
...and will ultimately create a gap between the two of you.

00:17.682 --> 00:20.755
Number two: Don't push your point of view with aggression...

00:20.967 --> 00:23.479
...as this will only put your boss in a defensive state,...

00:23.818 --> 00:26.223
...and he will less likely be open to your ideas.

00:26.619 --> 00:29.962
Number three: Don't try to prove that you are better than your boss.

00:30.223 --> 00:33.875
This is counterproductive and will leave your boss feeling inadequate.

00:34.479 --> 00:37.771
Instead, think about these three suggestions.

00:37.988 --> 00:40.678
Number one: Consider the fact that you may be wrong.

00:41.038 --> 00:44.519
Take the time to reflect on your thoughts and find middle ground.

00:45.033 --> 00:47.931
Number two: Patience goes a long way.

00:48.379 --> 00:50.873
So, keep that smile on your face and be cool.

00:51.489 --> 00:55.075
And finally, incorporate your ideas with your boss' ideas.

00:55.388 --> 00:58.592
This way, both of you can eventually come together and agree.

00:58.975 --> 01:00.901
Never stop pursuing common ground...

01:01.183 --> 01:03.956
...as this can be the foundation for a better relationship.

01:04.302 --> 01:06.830
