Hi, this is Brittany for About.com...

00:05.133 --> 00:08.003
...and these are some tips on how to pack your suit for business travel.

00:08.137 --> 00:14.443
Start by putting your right hand to the jacket's right side sleeve...

00:15.651 --> 00:16.925
...and pull it inside out.

00:18.147 --> 00:20.535
Now take your right hand again...

00:22.343 --> 00:27.983
...and stick the jacket's left sleeve back through the right sleeve...

00:29.499 --> 00:31.144
...so that the cuffs are even.

00:36.711 --> 00:38.089
Then, shake out the wrinkles.

00:39.020 --> 00:43.138
Find the tag and use that as your center point to line up the collars.

00:43.344 --> 00:48.079
Run your fingers down the length of the jacket to assure they are even.

00:49.774 --> 00:54.123
Now bring the combined sleeves up on top of the jacket,...

00:55.563 --> 00:58.655
...and from top to bottom, start to roll the jacket.

01:00.395 --> 01:04.029
Remember to try and make each roll as smooth as possible...

01:04.425 --> 01:05.815
...by pulling the wrinkles out.

01:15.145 --> 01:16.439
And here's what it should look like.

01:21.213 --> 01:25.203
Next, we will show you how to fold your pants without wrinkles.

01:28.159 --> 01:30.976
Start by rolling from the bottom to the top.

01:35.737 --> 01:39.571
As you're rolling, make sure to smooth out all the wrinkles.

01:48.877 --> 01:49.742
Thanks for watching.
