Here at Optimum, we recently found out...

00:01.849 --> 00:04.514
...that our phone number is one number different than Michael Bolton's.

00:04.779 --> 00:07.123
How many calls do you actually get, say, perhaps in a day?

00:08.436 --> 00:12.602
Sometimes 742 phone calls in one day.

00:13.416 --> 00:13.764
Hello?

00:14.237 --> 00:14.512
Hello?

00:14.881 --> 00:15.269
Hello?

00:15.458 --> 00:16.585
It's just maddening.

00:17.057 --> 00:19.963
So Optimum and Michael Bolton got together to clear things up...

00:20.465 --> 00:21.952
...for the sanity of Michael Bolton.

00:32.457 --> 00:34.425
How is it actually affecting your personal life?

00:34.947 --> 00:39.539
I don't have a personal life since my number became so close with Optimum.

00:39.629 --> 00:41.558
I tried to have dinner the other night....

00:42.415 --> 00:47.893
...with a lovely woman who has never heard the phone ring as much in her life.

00:48.200 --> 00:48.913
This is too much.

00:49.273 --> 00:49.758
It's too much.

01:04.013 --> 01:06.608
So if you could tell all those people that are calling you right now,...

01:06.676 --> 01:08.959
...that are calling you by accident, what would you say to them?

01:10.537 --> 01:11.232
Please don't call me.

01:12.509 --> 01:13.055
Please.
