Don't say I didn't warn you,...

00:02.605 --> 00:05.570
...but this next Kardashian story might make you a little queasy...

00:05.699 --> 00:07.570
...and not for all the normal reasons.

00:07.756 --> 00:10.198
On the latest episode of Kourtney and Kim Take Miami,...

00:10.423 --> 00:14.911
...Kim decides to get a "vampire facial" and document it for all her viewers.

00:15.031 --> 00:16.897
Hey guys, I'm Kristina Behr with Buzz60.

00:17.058 --> 00:19.229
So, what is that on her face?

00:19.495 --> 00:22.577
Basically, doctors take a giant needle, stick it in your arm,...

00:22.650 --> 00:25.136
...spin the blood around in a machine to remove platelets,...

00:25.340 --> 00:29.749
...and then that blood is splattered on your face using little acupuncture-like needles.

00:29.849 --> 00:33.000
She was aiming to look more youthful and smooth out wrinkles,...

00:33.101 --> 00:36.019
...but if anything, she looks more like something out of a horror movie.

00:36.205 --> 00:37.519
You think my skin looks better?

00:38.365 --> 00:38.678
No.

00:39.115 --> 00:43.257
After the treatment, Kim vowed she's never gonna get a face-lift because of the pain.

00:43.453 --> 00:46.965
Though this procedure usually only lasts for about 15 months,...

00:47.350 --> 00:49.426
...it's about 1500 bucks per session.

00:49.569 --> 00:51.253
I'm not sure what could be worse,...

00:51.439 --> 00:55.136
...this True Blood procedure or getting a bird poop facial.

00:55.256 --> 00:59.350
It proves celebs will do just about anything to stay looking young.

00:59.937 --> 01:00.626
Buzz60.

01:01.007 --> 01:02.485
Now you know, pass it on.
