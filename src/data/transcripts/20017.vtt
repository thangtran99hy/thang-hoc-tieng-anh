ï»¿Gleadell is a large grain trading business,...

00:11.869 --> 00:16.214
...also a large seller of seed and fertiliser to UK farmers.

00:17.319 --> 00:21.271
We are owned by Toepfer International...

00:21.795 --> 00:27.325
...and InVivo, who are respectively based in Hamburg and Paris...

00:27.473 --> 00:31.301
...and are large international trading entities.

00:32.545 --> 00:37.403
We import and we export throughout the EU...

00:38.162 --> 00:41.889
...and into the Mediterranean and occasionally further afield.

00:45.177 --> 00:48.176
The grain we trade is wheat,...

00:49.184 --> 00:56.069
...both for feed production, i.e. feed wheat, biscuit manufacture, flour milling.

00:56.839 --> 00:59.109
We also trade malting barley for beer.

01:00.148 --> 01:03.675
We also are large traders in oilseed rape,...

01:04.566 --> 01:07.590
...which nowadays goes into two markets: one is vegetable oils...

01:07.923 --> 01:09.673
...and the other is biodiesel production.

01:11.433 --> 01:17.955
Also, we trade pulses, both for human consumption and for feed,...

01:18.361 --> 01:21.358
...and they trade internationally throughout the Mediterranean.

01:21.883 --> 01:26.649
Volatile markets mean that farmers can get it wrong just as much as they can get it right,...

01:27.861 --> 01:29.768
...and getting it wrong can cost them,...

01:30.203 --> 01:35.749
...you know, 50, 60 pounds a ton on 3,000 tons of wheat, it's a big difference.

01:36.147 --> 01:42.332
So, we're selling our advisory services to farmers in return for doing their business.
