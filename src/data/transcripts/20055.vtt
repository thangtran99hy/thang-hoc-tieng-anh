ï»¿Is saving money better than not saving money?

00:02.153 --> 00:02.952
Yeah!

00:03.073 --> 00:04.749
Okay, if you save enough money, what would you do with it?

00:04.871 --> 00:07.267
I'll buy an island made out of candy.

00:07.517 --> 00:08.449
An island made out of candy?

There will be, like, sand full of sugar.

Sand full of sugar?

The water can be made of, like, soda.

The shower can be made of, like, hot fudge.

What about the animals, what would they be made of?

00:20.135 --> 00:21.537
I'm assuming they'll be made out of candy.

00:21.634 --> 00:22.579
It's not complicated.

00:22.790 --> 00:23.489
Saving is better.
