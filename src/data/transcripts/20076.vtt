00:00.070 --> 00:03.629
She may have divided Britain, but around the world leaders loved her.

00:04.229 --> 00:08.485
Margaret Thatcher thrust Britain back to the center of international politics.

00:10.125 --> 00:12.714
She joined forces with US President Ronald Reagan...

00:12.781 --> 00:17.416
...to pioneer a new type of free market economics, which then swept the world.

00:18.016 --> 00:21.234
Former Secretary of State Colin Powell knew her for 30 years.

00:21.457 --> 00:24.949
I think she was one of the unique leaders of this past century,...

00:26.054 --> 00:29.448
...and I think she did a great deal for her own country,...

00:29.573 --> 00:32.179
...in changing the economic balance within the country...

00:32.713 --> 00:34.319
...and putting it on a growth path.

00:35.575 --> 00:38.648
It was a young Russian journalist who dubbed her the "Iron Lady"...

00:38.777 --> 00:43.373
...after she made a speech warning that the Soviet Union was bent on world dominance.

00:43.851 --> 00:46.335
Her old foes are now more ready to forgive.

00:48.911 --> 00:52.562
She made a significant contribution to the development of British Soviet...

00:52.661 --> 00:56.434
...and British Russian relations for which we will always be grateful,...

00:56.656 --> 00:59.292
...and we will always remember her work with gratitude.

00:59.735 --> 01:02.171
I believe we have lost a major political figure.

01:03.333 --> 01:07.263
Thatcher's relationship with Europe was fractious, usually weary.

01:08.954 --> 01:12.861
She had an unshakable will, that's why she was called the Iron Lady.

01:13.269 --> 01:16.901
She did not have very much consideration for other people in the conversation...

01:17.039 --> 01:18.989
...because she thought they were weaker than her...

01:19.139 --> 01:23.457
...which wasn't necessarily true, but they could be open to some of her demands.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.441
But she bitterly opposed the reunification of Germany.

01:27.865 --> 01:32.077
Her relationship with the chancellor Helmut Kohl was, to say the least, tense.

01:33.469 --> 01:36.492
She's one of the most exceptionally gifted prime ministers there ever was.

01:37.247 --> 01:41.116
In many situations and in many confrontations, she stood her ground.

01:41.738 --> 01:43.731
You could only speak of her with great respect,...

01:44.252 --> 01:46.328
...even if on some things you have a different opinion.

01:46.497 --> 01:48.609
Meryl, can I get eyes on the one in red, please?

01:49.827 --> 01:52.807
Hollywood couldn't resist the magnetic pull of the Iron Lady.

01:53.169 --> 01:54.455
Steady the buffs, old girl.

01:55.811 --> 01:59.181
Watch your actions for they become your character.

01:59.281 --> 02:01.934
Actress Meryl Streep who became Thatcher for the film...

02:02.181 --> 02:05.316
...has praised her as a pioneer for the role of women in politics.

02:06.317 --> 02:10.391
Margaret Thatcher may have infuriated the world statesmen with her stubbornness...

02:10.773 --> 02:14.972
...but the reaction of global leaders demonstrates that the world will not readily forget...

02:15.067 --> 02:17.987
...the legacy of a greengrocer's daughter from Grantham.

02:18.369 --> 02:20.163
