00:03.831 --> 00:09.713
Britain's first, and so far only, female prime minister deserved her nickname, the "Iron Lady".

00:10.705 --> 00:14.284
Margaret Thatcher was a formidable politician at home and abroad...

00:14.657 --> 00:18.050
...and her 11-and-a-half year premiership changed the face of Britain.

00:18.923 --> 00:22.659
Her tough economic reforms and brand of individualistic capitalism...

00:22.963 --> 00:26.617
...would come to be known as "Thatcherism", ensuring her place in the history books.

00:27.178 --> 00:30.694
However, her divisive legacy has as many detractors as fans.

00:32.869 --> 00:37.966
The greengrocer's daughter and former chemist became Conservative Party leader in 1975...

00:38.321 --> 00:39.899
...and prime minister four years later.

00:40.525 --> 00:44.987
Her popularity and uncompromising reputation grew after a tough military response...

00:45.055 --> 00:49.251
...to Argentina's invasion of the British Falkland Islands in 1982.

00:50.085 --> 00:53.091
The rest of that decade would be defined by the Thatcher government's...

00:53.189 --> 00:56.519
...restructuring of the industrial and social fabric of Britain.

00:57.312 --> 01:01.813
She crushed a miners' strike and took on the trade unions, reigning in their strength.

01:02.486 --> 01:05.068
Her policies saw a decline in traditional manufacturing...

01:05.398 --> 01:09.086
...and created a decade synonymous with unashamed moneymaking.

01:09.649 --> 01:13.293
Unemployment and social deprivation were also rife under Thatcher.
