Hello?

00:11.920 --> 00:13.484
My dad always told me stories,...

00:14.660 --> 00:19.684
...about a hidden world where brave warriors watch over and protect us.

00:20.435 --> 00:21.584
Isn't that cool?

00:22.859 --> 00:23.475
He always said,...

00:23.930 --> 00:26.966
..."Just because you haven't seen something, doesn't mean it's not there".

00:34.554 --> 00:34.998
Dad?

00:48.545 --> 00:49.924
What's going on, baby girl?

00:50.153 --> 00:50.981
Talking snails.

00:51.151 --> 00:53.001
Actually, I'm a slug.

00:53.118 --> 00:54.285
No shell over here, baby.

00:56.786 --> 00:57.526
Who are you people?

00:59.063 --> 00:59.717
We are the Leaf Men.

01:00.135 --> 01:01.170
Protectors of the forest.

01:03.159 --> 01:03.957
Wow!

01:05.481 --> 01:06.304
My dad was right.

01:11.774 --> 01:13.907
I am going to destroy the forest.

01:14.291 --> 01:17.576
But I'm only going to do it once so try to pay attention.

01:18.651 --> 01:19.229
Run!

01:25.151 --> 01:26.144
Come on, you're with us now.

01:46.091 --> 01:48.893
Dad, I had the most messed up dream.

01:49.514 --> 01:53.918
There were talking slugs and tiny, little soldiers.

01:55.465 --> 01:55.997
Hello.

01:56.794 --> 01:58.367
Oh, man.

02:02.623 --> 02:03.087
Dad!

02:03.791 --> 02:04.489
I'm here.

02:07.863 --> 02:08.717
Ozzy.

02:08.997 --> 02:10.315
No kisses.

02:10.428 --> 02:11.002
Run!
