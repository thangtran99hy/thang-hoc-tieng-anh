00:01.354 --> 00:07.806
US police and law enforcement agencies are investigating the deadly bomb attacks Monday...

00:07.916 --> 00:10.201
...during the annual Boston Marathon.

00:10.641 --> 00:14.833
President Obama promised every single federal resource necessary...

00:14.963 --> 00:17.784
...to care for the victims and counsel the families.

00:18.215 --> 00:23.127
Boston police, firefighters and first responders as well as the National Guard...

00:23.334 --> 00:27.188
...responded heroically and continue to do so as we speak.

00:27.996 --> 00:32.365
It's a reminder that so many Americans serve and sacrifice on our behalf every single day...

00:32.783 --> 00:37.067
...without regard to their own safety in dangerous and difficult circumstances.

00:37.273 --> 00:41.239
And we salute all those who assisted and responded so quickly...

00:41.468 --> 00:43.537
...and professionally to this tragedy.

00:44.761 --> 00:49.333
The president also vowed that the perpetrators of the attacks will be found...

00:49.745 --> 00:52.713
...and will feel the full weight of justice.

00:53.323 --> 00:57.045
Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis told the news conference...

00:57.151 --> 01:01.578
...investigators are trying to determine where the bombs were planted.

01:01.861 --> 01:05.957
After this incident occurred, there were certainly a lot of people...

01:06.027 --> 01:07.128
...who were running from the scene.

01:07.601 --> 01:10.903
Some of them deposited bags and parcels that they were carrying.

01:11.499 --> 01:16.115
Each one of those bags and parcels is being treated as suspicious device at this point in time.

01:16.594 --> 01:19.927
We have multiple EOD teams that are checking each one of these bags.

01:20.366 --> 01:23.359
But at this point, we have not found another device.

01:24.198 --> 01:27.673
Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick said the FBI...

01:27.811 --> 01:33.593
...and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are helping with the investigation...

01:33.939 --> 01:37.877
...and he called on people to contribute any information they may have.

01:38.288 --> 01:42.853
Again, if people have information, please use those tip lines.

01:42.979 --> 01:48.085
This is very, very important that we get as current information as we can,...

01:48.247 --> 01:49.680
...as quickly as possible.

01:50.307 --> 01:51.378
Happy to take any questions.

01:53.557 --> 01:58.722
Security was boosted across the United States after the Boston Marathon blasts.

01:59.149 --> 02:03.940
A White House official said the incidents in Boston were clearly acts of terror.

02:04.944 --> 02:07.967
