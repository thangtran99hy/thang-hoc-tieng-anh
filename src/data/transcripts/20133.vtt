00:05.725 --> 00:08.164
The shock has been felt around the world.

00:08.773 --> 00:12.177
Flowers and notes turned up outside the US embassy in Moscow.

00:13.199 --> 00:16.089
From South Africa, an expression of solidarity.

00:16.506 --> 00:21.105
We take strong exception to instances where people or groups...

00:21.361 --> 00:24.249
...resort to violence to settle whatever their difference.

00:24.982 --> 00:26.598
And one from China as well.

00:29.269 --> 00:33.868
China strongly condemns and opposes all violent attacks against civilians,...

00:34.173 --> 00:37.345
...and feels grieved about those killed in the incident.

00:38.115 --> 00:41.334
From Afghanistan, which has had more than its share of bombings,...

00:41.672 --> 00:46.124
...came condolences from President Hamid Karzai through his deputy spokesman.

00:46.705 --> 00:50.365
He was saddened to hear that innocent people were hurt.

00:50.774 --> 00:55.449
The people of Afghanistan can very well understand better than any other country in the world...

00:55.900 --> 01:00.061
...the suffering and the pains that arise from such incidents.

01:00.898 --> 01:03.841
In Berlin, German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle...

01:03.922 --> 01:08.327
...expressed what has been on the minds of many in Boston and across the US.

01:08.875 --> 01:17.049
What was intended as a great event of joy turned into a terrible tragedy.

01:17.813 --> 01:23.999
I hope that the perpetrators of this cruel act will be found and brought to justice.

01:24.523 --> 01:27.177
London is set to hold its own marathon in days.

01:27.649 --> 01:29.499
Boris Johnson is London's mayor.

01:29.792 --> 01:32.977
The events in Boston were absolutely horrific...

01:33.065 --> 01:36.688
...and obviously our thoughts are with the victims and their families.

01:37.135 --> 01:41.887
Johnson says security in London will be stepped up and that the race will go on.

01:43.021 --> 01:48.461
For now, going on is all that many affected by the Boston Marathon bombings can do.
