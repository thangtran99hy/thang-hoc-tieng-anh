Larry, the CEO of a major computer parts manufacturer, has been feeling frustrated.

00:18.339 --> 00:22.701
Business was good thus far because he offered high-quality products at a fair price...

00:23.028 --> 00:25.610
...and he maintained a close relationship with his clients.

00:27.987 --> 00:31.181
But the number of competitors increased because of globalization.

00:31.520 --> 00:36.349
Because of their strong offerings, Larry could no longer compete on price and quality.

00:39.438 --> 00:43.171
He can't find any other way to lower cost or improve on quality.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.473
How can he overcome this crisis?

00:57.421 --> 00:59.055
Hello everyone, my name is Rich Scott.

00:59.546 --> 01:03.370
Many B2B companies face similar problems as that of Larry's company.

01:04.278 --> 01:06.857
In the past, all B2B companies had to focus on...

01:06.944 --> 01:11.112
...was offering good quality products at a fair price with on time delivery.

01:11.492 --> 01:12.852
Simply put, QCD.

01:13.285 --> 01:17.831
And building a good relationship with clients through good sales skills put the cherry on top.

01:18.669 --> 01:20.248
However, that's not enough anymore.

01:20.533 --> 01:25.474
As technology levels off, competitors are making similar products at similar prices.

01:25.903 --> 01:29.621
In other words, the era of competing with quality and price has ended.
