What's up? Jaden Smith here and I've got one word for you: trees.

00:08.728 --> 00:11.280
Not just any trees, but the kind that can save the world.

00:12.176 --> 00:14.064
Earth is our home, and we've got to treat it right...

00:14.185 --> 00:15.275
...or else it's going to kick us out.

00:16.411 --> 00:18.063
If not this generation, then the next.

00:19.854 --> 00:21.868
But you have the chance to keep that from happening.

00:22.406 --> 00:24.229
Support Earth Day in The Canopy Project.

00:24.531 --> 00:27.395
The program that plants trees in communities all over the world.
