ï»¿My name is Zachary Quinto.

00:22.803 --> 00:24.339
I'm Alanis Morissette.

00:24.779 --> 00:31.031
The inspiration for my label is the convergence of a few things.

00:31.135 --> 00:38.066
First of all, some time that I spent in South America, which was the most connected I ever felt to the Earth.

00:42.528 --> 00:45.040
The inspiration for my label was the idea of...

00:45.143 --> 00:48.692
...2013 for me, personally being about the divine feminine...

00:48.774 --> 00:52.484
...and there's no better place that the divine feminine is evidenced than in the planet.

01:02.595 --> 01:08.629
Well, I mean the thing about saving the environment is it seems like such an impossibly huge task.

01:10.575 --> 01:14.611
But the reality is that it's the small things that make a difference.

01:15.253 --> 01:18.928
I choose to be socially conscious because there's no other direction to go in...

01:18.997 --> 01:24.923
...and I like moving toward a North Star that benefits me personally...

01:25.006 --> 01:27.803
...and my connection with other people and the planets.

01:27.995 --> 01:29.921
And I live for connection.

01:32.926 --> 01:38.861
I was really grateful when the opportunity presented itself to get involved...

01:39.767 --> 01:45.488
...because I feel like you have a responsibility, and as someone that's in the public eye,...

01:46.097 --> 01:49.132
...I'm always happy to be able to get behind the causes that I believe in...

01:49.215 --> 01:53.396
...and I think that it's important to invite other people into a dialog...

01:53.548 --> 01:55.163
...and invite other people to take action.

01:55.675 --> 01:59.259
Kiehl's is incredible in that way.

01:59.809 --> 02:04.035
I think recycling and being rewarded is very smart for us creatures who like gifting.

02:04.725 --> 02:11.693
And we like to be celebrated, and so just to serve and then be recognized for that is really amazing.

02:13.235 --> 02:18.831
So, at 950,000 recycled jars, that's only 50,000 away from a million.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.245
Let's make it happen.

02:21.019 --> 02:22.579
Recycle and be rewarded.

02:23.285 --> 02:23.741
Are you on Twitter?

02:23.820 --> 02:24.476
You guys on Twitter?

02:25.169 --> 02:25.247
Yeah!

02:25.319 --> 02:25.536
Yeah?

02:26.595 --> 02:32.063
Follow Kiehl's on Twitter, like us on Facebook, Instagram Kiehl's...

02:33.032 --> 02:35.501
