ï»¿I'm Mitch Hedlund.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.840
I'm the founder of Recycle Across America.

00:23.824 --> 00:28.389
Recycle Across America is a non-profit organization that is developed...

00:28.462 --> 00:30.828
...to simplify recycling in the US.

00:31.321 --> 00:33.621
We've introduced a standardized labeling system...

00:33.705 --> 00:38.407
...that is helping people become better recyclers out in public and it's making a difference.

00:40.041 --> 00:44.906
For 2013, we are so honored to be chosen by Kiehl's again for a donation...

00:44.992 --> 00:50.671
...that will allow us to give 65,000 pre-standardized labels to public schools throughout the US.

00:50.875 --> 00:54.041
We are grateful to Alanis Morissette and Zach Quinto...

00:54.266 --> 00:59.519
...for donating their time and their effort in bringing awareness to this important initiative.

00:59.861 --> 01:04.023
If there's one thing that we can do for the environment, it is recycling.

01:04.274 --> 01:09.721
Recycling impacts our land, our air, our water, our energy usage.

01:10.393 --> 01:14.563
If we can improve our recycling rates to 75 percent in the US,...

01:14.645 --> 01:17.943
...it will generate 1.5 million new jobs.

01:18.690 --> 01:20.707
And it will be the environmental equivalent...

01:20.864 --> 01:24.965
...of removing 55 million cars off US roads each year.

01:26.019 --> 01:27.590
Recycle and be rewarded.
