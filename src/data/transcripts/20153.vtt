Is Facebook about to unveil an Android-based phone?

00:05.689 --> 00:07.715
So goes the speculation on tech blogs...

00:07.862 --> 00:11.205
...sparked by a press event the company just scheduled for April 4.

00:11.485 --> 00:13.950
Dubbed "Come See Our New Home on Android",

00:14.071 --> 00:16.289
...the event has been pegged by a Techcrunch source...

00:16.452 --> 00:20.625
...as the launch of an HTC handset with a distinctly Facebook twist.

00:20.787 --> 00:23.779
The new device may feature an altered Android operating system...

00:23.903 --> 00:25.685
...with deep Facebook integration,...

00:25.830 --> 00:29.202
...including a mobile home screen driven by Facebook services and apps.

00:29.322 --> 00:31.560
The rumored name is Facebook Home,...

00:31.708 --> 00:35.592
...and it could bring an end to years of whispers about Facebook's mobile intentions.

00:35.737 --> 00:38.384
Alas, for like, happy, true believers...

00:38.538 --> 00:41.647
...the result appears to be more of a phone inundated with Facebook...

00:41.767 --> 00:43.691
...than the mythic Facebook phone.
