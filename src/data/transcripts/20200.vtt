Many people ask me, "Mr. Duncan what is the best way to speak English?"

00:06.100 --> 00:10.179
Is it with an American accent or a British accent?

00:11.097 --> 00:14.429
I think this is a very interesting question indeed.

00:15.183 --> 00:17.558
But my answer to this question is quite simple.

00:18.259 --> 00:22.145
You use the English that you feel the most comfortable with.

00:22.843 --> 00:26.309
You don't have to sound like an American when you're speaking.

00:26.673 --> 00:29.555
You don't have to sound like a British person when you're speaking.

00:29.907 --> 00:33.337
As long as you feel comfortable with the way you use English.

00:33.840 --> 00:36.071
That is the most important thing of all.

00:36.414 --> 00:41.683
Of course, it's also important that the other person understands what you're saying as well.

00:42.086 --> 00:47.252
So don't worry too much about sounding like somebody else.

00:47.761 --> 00:50.745
Don't try to copy somebody else's way of speaking.

00:51.198 --> 00:54.780
What you have to do is develop your own way of using English.

00:55.031 --> 00:59.359
Don't forget English is an emotional language, it's a personal language.

00:59.821 --> 01:03.909
It's a language that you use to express the way you feel.

01:04.261 --> 01:08.715
So don't worry about sounding like somebody else.
