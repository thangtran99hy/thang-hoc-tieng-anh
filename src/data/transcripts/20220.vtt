00:00.273 --> 00:05.387
The science is clear that man-made emissions of air pollution and global warming gases...

00:05.539 --> 00:07.651
...are changing our atmosphere.

00:07.723 --> 00:10.759
...still an issue that the scientists are still debating, and you know it and I know it.

00:18.530 --> 00:21.765
The debate on the causes of climate change are far from settled.

00:21.945 --> 00:23.059
Well, the climate's always changing.

00:23.221 --> 00:24.392
That's not the fundamental question.

00:24.461 --> 00:28.749
The fundamental question is whether man-made activity is what's contributing most to it.

00:32.669 --> 00:35.865
I understand that people said there's a significant scientific consensus on that issue,...

00:36.177 --> 00:38.838
...but I've actually seen reasonable debate on that principle.

00:38.937 --> 00:42.821
You looked at this last year, it was the warmest year in the last decade,...

00:42.951 --> 00:44.653
...I think, with the numbers that came out.

00:47.118 --> 00:47.889
I accept that.

00:48.760 --> 00:50.861
I did not say that it is man-made.

00:51.247 --> 00:56.073
I don't think CO2 is a problem, and therefore, I don't think it needs to be regulated.

00:56.275 --> 00:58.962
We all breathe CO2, and climate changes,...

00:59.062 --> 01:04.836
...but there's no evidence at all that it's man-made CO2 that causes the climate to change.

01:05.011 --> 01:06.016
It's almost comical.

01:06.891 --> 01:11.039
Every time we exhale, we exhale carbon dioxide.

01:11.907 --> 01:17.859
Every cow in the world, when they do what they do, you've got more carbon dioxide.

01:20.800 --> 01:21.629
It could be secular.

01:22.135 --> 01:23.919
It could be just a shift on the axis.

01:25.569 --> 01:28.546
The ice caps are melting, which we see over and over again.

01:28.731 --> 01:30.703
Yeah, they're melting on Mars too!

01:32.009 --> 01:35.703
I'd like to have somebody to look at the lesser optimum, which is a little closer in time...

01:35.797 --> 01:37.187
...and how much did the temperature rise,...

01:37.286 --> 01:41.967
...then we know that that led to the Vikings dominating Europe for several hundred years.

01:48.709 --> 01:52.647
The idea of human-induced global climate change...

01:53.127 --> 01:59.356
...is one of the greatest hoaxes perpetrated out of the scientific community.

01:59.549 --> 02:00.461
It is a hoax.

02:05.588 --> 02:08.152
We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy,...

02:08.804 --> 02:10.817
...and the most severe drought in decades,...

02:11.425 --> 02:13.831
...and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen,...

02:13.967 --> 02:15.497
...were all just a freak coincidence,...

02:17.493 --> 02:21.091
...or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science...

02:21.231 --> 02:22.609
...and act before it's too late.
