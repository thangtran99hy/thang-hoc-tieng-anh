ï»¿My name is Branson, Sir Richard Branson.

00:11.535 --> 00:15.755
And as founder of the Virgin Group, I've been in my share of compromising positions.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.813
I've usually gotten out of them with a little luck.

00:19.813 --> 00:23.925
People ask me "Your Excellency, how do you always end up on top?"

00:24.617 --> 00:26.065
And the answer is, I don't.

00:26.537 --> 00:29.772
Sometimes I end up in the mouth of a whale shark.

00:30.687 --> 00:32.195
But enough about me.

00:33.121 --> 00:36.611
Here is my guide to getting lucky at 35,000 feet.

00:37.845 --> 00:41.454
First, pinpoint the object of your affection.

00:42.763 --> 00:47.491
Once the seatbelt sign is off, approach her with a check for her favorite charity.

00:48.121 --> 00:51.563
Carry it in the mouth of a puppy that you've given the power of speech to.

00:52.703 --> 00:55.131
Direct her attention to the window where she will see...

00:55.234 --> 00:59.355
...your suborbital spaceship, composing a haiku in sky writing.

01:00.928 --> 01:05.140
Drive to your launch pad, pole vault her into the basket of your hot air balloon,...

01:05.849 --> 01:07.981
...and take flight to your private island.

01:09.304 --> 01:11.605
If you need a more cost-effective alternative,...

01:12.393 --> 01:15.255
...try treating her or him to something delicious...

01:15.377 --> 01:17.839
...using the new seat-to-seat feature of Red,...

01:18.321 --> 01:20.786
...the Virgin America in-flight entertainment system.

01:21.681 --> 01:23.773
Just order a drink, meal or snack.

01:24.339 --> 01:25.835
Select his or her seat....

01:26.401 --> 01:30.022
...and don't forget to seal the deal with a suggestive seat-to-seat chat.

01:31.033 --> 01:34.569
I'm not a betting man but I say your chances of deplaning with a plus-one...

01:34.910 --> 01:36.503
...are at least 50 percent.

01:37.570 --> 01:38.575
Best of luck out there.

01:38.981 --> 01:39.288
Cheers.
