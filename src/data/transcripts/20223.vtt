00:02.572 --> 00:04.006
ï»¿There were once three brothers...

00:04.771 --> 00:08.800
...who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight.

00:11.844 --> 00:15.883
In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass.

00:17.511 --> 00:19.143
But being learned in the magical arts,...

00:19.327 --> 00:23.335
...the three brothers simply waved their wands and made a bridge.

00:25.903 --> 00:31.232
Before they could cross, however, they found their path blocked by a hooded figure.

00:32.561 --> 00:35.401
It was Death, and he felt cheated.

00:36.653 --> 00:39.149
Cheated because travelers would normally drown in the river.

00:39.767 --> 00:40.854
But Death was cunning.

00:42.454 --> 00:45.407
He pretended to congratulate the three brothers on their magic,...

00:45.805 --> 00:49.787
...and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him.

00:51.609 --> 00:55.815
The oldest asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence.

00:56.341 --> 00:59.779
So Death fashioned him one from an elder tree that stood nearby.

01:02.363 --> 01:06.419
The second brother decided he wanted to humiliate Death even further,...

01:06.871 --> 01:09.964
...and asked for the power to recall loved ones from the grave.

01:11.683 --> 01:14.735
So Death plucked a stone from the river and offered it to him.

01:16.698 --> 01:19.469
Finally, Death turned to the third brother.

01:21.806 --> 01:27.059
A humble man, he asked for something that would allow him to go forth from that place...

01:27.829 --> 01:29.701
...without being followed by Death.

01:31.975 --> 01:36.740
And so it was that Death reluctantly handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.
