00:01.784 --> 00:04.335
The first brother traveled to a distant village...

00:05.073 --> 00:06.821
...where with the Elder Wand in hand,...

00:07.343 --> 00:09.780
...he killed a wizard with whom he had once quarreled.

00:13.222 --> 00:16.351
Drunk with the power that the Elder Wand had given him,...

00:16.998 --> 00:18.745
...he bragged of his invincibility.

00:22.896 --> 00:26.625
But that night, another wizard stole the wand,...

00:26.720 --> 00:28.679
...and slit the brother's throat for good measure.

00:29.999 --> 00:32.165
And so Death took the first brother for his own.

00:34.205 --> 00:35.870
The second brother journeyed to his home,...

00:36.205 --> 00:38.497
...where he took the stone and turned it thrice in hand.

00:39.446 --> 00:43.288
To his delight, the girl he had once hoped to marry before her untimely death...

00:44.141 --> 00:45.279
...appeared before him.

00:46.887 --> 00:51.423
Yet soon she turned sad and cold for she did not belong in the mortal world.

00:52.532 --> 00:56.429
Driven mad with hopeless longing, the second brother killed himself so as to join her.

00:58.651 --> 01:00.904
And so Death took the second brother.

01:01.990 --> 01:03.342
As for the third brother,...

01:03.792 --> 01:07.149
...Death searched for many years but was never able to find him.

01:08.285 --> 01:11.096
Only when he attained a great age did the youngest brother...

01:11.327 --> 01:14.325
...shed the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son.

01:16.806 --> 01:20.703
He then greeted Death as an old friend and went with him gladly,...

01:21.106 --> 01:23.717
...departing this life as equals.
