00:00.050 --> 00:01.595
What's better, faster or slower?

00:01.732 --> 00:02.801
Faster.

00:02.906 --> 00:03.721
Okay, what's fast?

00:04.241 --> 00:05.728
My mom's car and a cheetah.

00:06.051 --> 00:06.377
Okay.

00:06.455 --> 00:07.097
A spaceship.

00:07.211 --> 00:08.717
Spaceship, and what's slow?

00:09.149 --> 00:10.145
My grandma is slow.

00:10.320 --> 00:11.805
Would you like it better if she was fast?

00:12.059 --> 00:13.965
I bet she would like it if she was fast.

00:15.241 --> 00:16.891
Maybe give her some turbo boosters.

00:17.429 --> 00:18.692
Tape a cheetah to her back.

00:18.921 --> 00:20.007
Tape a cheetah to her back?

00:21.035 --> 00:22.694
Seems like you've thought about this before.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.760
It's not complicated, faster is better.

00:24.975 --> 00:28.009
And iPhone 5 downloads fastest on AT&T 4G.
