00:02.249 --> 00:06.953
Love. It's the most powerful thing on the planet.

00:09.940 --> 00:13.063
Love is there to hold us in the beginning.

00:14.267 --> 00:20.653
They are to comfort us as we grow old and there for all the times in between.

00:21.829 --> 00:23.611
Love is family.

00:25.654 --> 00:27.819
Love is life.

00:30.004 --> 00:33.759
And for that love, you sacrifice it all.

00:35.322 --> 00:38.022
Love is the reason you care,...

00:38.987 --> 00:41.933
...for the tiny and the fragile,...

00:42.533 --> 00:45.613
...for the wise and irreplaceable,...

00:46.337 --> 00:52.653
...for all the things in your life that make life worth living.
