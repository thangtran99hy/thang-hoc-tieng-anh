My mum always says that whenever I win a race,...

00:07.848 --> 00:09.611
...it's never done through my hard work and my training...

00:10.417 --> 00:12.178
...but it's due to her cooking and her support.

00:12.661 --> 00:13.889
And who knows, she's probably right.

00:14.401 --> 00:17.117
One of the best things about my mum is she would always tell me,...

00:17.188 --> 00:19.787
..."You can only do your best and we love you no matter what."

00:20.245 --> 00:21.635
Which I think was really important...

00:21.805 --> 00:23.866
...because even when the competition was very stressful...

00:23.964 --> 00:26.520
...and I was worried about my performance, she would remind me of that.

00:26.771 --> 00:30.758
I remember my mum always being there, supporting me on those wet and cold days.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.934
I'd like to thank my mum for all the time she spent...

00:33.053 --> 00:35.636
...ferrying me backwards and forwards from athletics clubs.

00:35.990 --> 00:39.272
I'd like to thank my mum for all of the hot dinners she put on the table for me.

00:39.511 --> 00:41.671
There are many things I want to thank my mum for...

00:42.042 --> 00:44.364
...and possibly the most important one for me...

00:44.531 --> 00:47.252
...was her moving in with me after my knee surgery.

00:47.575 --> 00:50.961
I'd like to thank my family for having the loudest cheer in the stadium.

00:51.417 --> 00:53.365
When I ran the 200 meters earlier this year,...

00:53.438 --> 00:54.997
...I was worried that I wouldn't be able to hear them.

00:55.324 --> 00:59.637
As I came out of the 200-meter bend, I heard this almighty noise that was my family.

00:59.874 --> 01:03.220
Mum, I'd like to thank you for buying me the Guinness Book of World Records every year...

01:03.293 --> 01:05.501
...and actually inspire me to pursue my swimming career.

01:05.818 --> 01:09.303
Thank you, mum, for taking me to all the competitions.

01:09.995 --> 01:13.318
Every year, my mum and I would travel hundreds and hundreds of miles...

01:13.405 --> 01:15.852
...to all these different competitions all over the country.

01:17.154 --> 01:19.076
My mum would do this without complaining.

01:19.235 --> 01:22.008
From sewing my first solo costume for 12 hours,...

01:22.334 --> 01:24.564
...I appreciate it so much and you're amazing.

01:24.719 --> 01:25.633
So thank you, mum.

01:26.904 --> 01:27.331
Thank you, mum.

01:28.317 --> 01:28.866
Thank you, mum.

01:29.521 --> 01:30.044
Thank you, mum.

01:30.761 --> 01:31.265
Thank you.

01:32.394 --> 01:33.059
Thank you, mum.

01:34.201 --> 01:34.591
Thank you, mum.

01:35.227 --> 01:35.801
Thank you, mum.

01:36.522 --> 01:37.112
Thank you, mum.

01:37.379 --> 01:38.126
Thank you, mum.
