00:04.017 --> 00:07.989
ï»¿The primary flight controls are the ailerons, rudder and elevator.

00:08.797 --> 00:12.705
Ailerons control roll about the airplane's longitudinal axis,...

00:12.818 --> 00:14.657
...which runs through the nose and tail.

00:15.327 --> 00:18.987
The ailerons are attached to the outboard trailing edge of each wing...

00:19.058 --> 00:21.421
...and move in opposite directions from each other.

00:23.022 --> 00:26.431
The rudder controls movement of the airplane about its vertical axis,...

00:26.540 --> 00:28.841
...which runs to the top and bottom of the airplane.

00:29.575 --> 00:31.457
This motion is referred to as yaw.

00:33.163 --> 00:38.395
Elevator controls pitch about the lateral axis which runs through the wing tips.

00:39.628 --> 00:44.031
In most small airplanes, the ailerons, rudder and elevators are connected...

00:44.107 --> 00:47.989
...to the airplane's control wheels mechanically through cables and pulleys...

00:51.734 --> 00:54.599
Secondary flight controls include flaps and trim.

00:55.949 --> 01:00.257
Flaps extend from the lower surface of the wings, increasing lift and drag.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.577
There are four common flap types:...

01:03.288 --> 01:06.140
...plain, which simply angles downward on a hinge,...

01:06.756 --> 01:10.609
...split flaps, which increase lift and drag more than plain flaps,...

01:11.099 --> 01:15.500
...slotted flaps, which increase lift a great deal more than plain or split flaps...

01:15.613 --> 01:19.418
...by allowing high-pressure air from below, up and over the flaps...

01:20.225 --> 01:25.193
...and Fowler flaps, a type of slotted flap which extends rearward and downward.

01:26.861 --> 01:31.625
Trim consists of a small tab attached to the primary flight control by a hinge.

01:32.513 --> 01:36.065
Airplanes have roll trim, rudder trim and or elevator trim.

01:36.841 --> 01:39.901
As the airplane is flown in different speeds and configurations,...

01:39.971 --> 01:44.932
...it will tend to pitch, roll or yaw, requiring the pilot to place a continuous force...

01:45.320 --> 01:48.978
...on the controls in order to keep the airplane in the desired orientation.

01:50.373 --> 01:54.249
By using trim, the pilot is able to relieve these flight control pressures,...

01:54.493 --> 01:55.759
...which reduces workload.
