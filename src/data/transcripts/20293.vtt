Autism is a disorder where people have problems in three areas.

00:09.655 --> 00:11.483
One is in communication,...

00:11.836 --> 00:16.629
...the second area is in social interaction, how they get along with other people,...

00:17.150 --> 00:21.049
...and the third area is their range of interests.

00:24.097 --> 00:28.851
There are grades of each of these, ranging from mild to severe.

00:29.388 --> 00:32.340
So, for this reason we call it a spectrum.

00:35.218 --> 00:38.241
The latest estimates from the Centers for Disease Control...

00:38.716 --> 00:43.936
...are that one in 88 people are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.

00:44.590 --> 00:46.985
The risk is even higher in males,...

00:47.120 --> 00:52.651
...where one in 54 males are getting a diagnosis on the autism spectrum.

00:55.762 --> 00:58.390
We don't know what causes autism right now.

00:58.879 --> 01:02.705
We do know that it has a strong genetic tendency.

01:03.244 --> 01:08.689
There are several genes that have been identified as having an increased risk,...

01:09.036 --> 01:14.603
...but that doesn't begin to explain all the cases of autism that we are seeing nowadays.

01:14.853 --> 01:19.431
But since we don't know what causes autism, we aren't really able to prevent it.
