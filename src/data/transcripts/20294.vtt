00:00.250 --> 00:03.104
Today, my ambulance knew all about a bike accident...

00:03.444 --> 00:04.663
...just by talking to a helmet.

00:05.242 --> 00:07.757
It grabbed the patient's record before we even picked him up.

00:08.601 --> 00:11.058
It found out the doctor we needed was at St. Anne's.

00:12.011 --> 00:14.356
And they got his okay on treatment from miles away.

00:15.049 --> 00:16.654
It even pulled strings with the stoplights.

00:17.658 --> 00:20.489
My ambulance talks with smoke alarms and pilots...

00:20.949 --> 00:24.148
...and stadiums, but of course, it's a good listener too.

00:24.567 --> 00:27.489
Today, Cisco is connecting the Internet of everything.

00:27.905 --> 00:29.949
So everything works like never before.
