In this tutorial, I'm going to go over pronunciation of the phonetic alphabet...

00:05.817 --> 00:08.409
...as according to Airman's Information Manual.

00:08.957 --> 00:14.942
In addition, I will play for you a sample recording of the morse code for that letter...

00:15.349 --> 00:22.503
...because when we tune and identify to a navigational aid, be it a VOR or NDB,...

00:22.967 --> 00:28.047
...the beeping sound that we hear will be the morse code for the three-letter identifier.

00:28.485 --> 00:32.128
So, let's continue and see the letters of the alphabet.
