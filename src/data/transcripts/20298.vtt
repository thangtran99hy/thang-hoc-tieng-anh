00:03.555 --> 00:05.146
So let me go over a few things with you.

00:05.889 --> 00:07.056
Here are some items to remember.

00:08.636 --> 00:12.279
You need to listen before you transmit and make sure that no one else is speaking.

00:12.382 --> 00:15.479
So before you key that mic, just listen for a moment,...

00:15.587 --> 00:17.626
...make sure no one else is talking at the same time.

00:18.971 --> 00:23.191
Another thing is that you need to always use your call sign when you're using the radio,...

00:23.379 --> 00:27.571
...because if you don't use your call sign, air traffic control is not going to know who's speaking.

00:29.114 --> 00:33.269
And also you want to try to make your transmission as quick as possible.

00:33.423 --> 00:34.891
Think about what you're gonna say first.

00:35.547 --> 00:39.795
Try to make that transmission as quick as possible because while you're transmitting,...

00:40.191 --> 00:42.432
...no other pilot or controller can transmit.

00:44.835 --> 00:49.841
Now, if you want to say "no" on the radio, you don't say "no," you say "negative."

00:50.671 --> 00:53.583
If you want to say "yes," you say "affirmative."

00:54.649 --> 00:58.867
Now, the word "roger," what that means is, it doesn't mean "yes" or "no."

00:59.226 --> 01:02.625
What "roger" means is, "I received your message."

01:04.465 --> 01:07.230
Now, "nine" in German means "no."

01:07.624 --> 01:12.323
So to avoid any confusion, if you want to say the number "nine,"...

01:12.659 --> 01:15.476
...you need to say "niner" while you're on the radio.

01:17.315 --> 01:22.339
And also to avoid confusion because some letters sound similar to one another,...

01:22.459 --> 01:24.939
...let's say there was static on the radio and I said "B,"...

01:25.551 --> 01:28.669
...you might have thought I said "V" and that could cause a problem.

01:29.213 --> 01:33.220
So, instead of saying any letter, you use the phonetic alphabet.

01:33.339 --> 01:36.533
So each letter is assigned a word in the phonetic alphabet.
