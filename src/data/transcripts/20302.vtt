Hey everyone, Jason Schappert of MzeroA.com.

00:05.526 --> 00:09.061
This video on VFR flight following comes from...

00:09.291 --> 00:13.982
...an idea by an MzeroA fan, Scott Coute in Vermont.

00:14.285 --> 00:16.046
All Scott did was shoot me an email saying,...

00:16.113 --> 00:21.129
..."Hey Jason, I notice you really don't have a video on VFR flight following."

00:21.333 --> 00:22.145
"Could you make one?"

00:22.307 --> 00:26.207
I said, "Scott, as long as I can use your first and last name and where you're from,..."

00:26.498 --> 00:28.697
"...I'll be more than happy to make a video about it."

00:28.769 --> 00:34.861
Guys, if you have any video ideas, maybe something I haven't talked about yet...

00:34.939 --> 00:37.754
...or something you would like to see explained a bit better,...

00:38.101 --> 00:42.963
...all you have to do is shoot me an email, Jason at MzeroA.com.

00:43.157 --> 00:47.177
I'll be more than happy to take some time to make a video for you guys.

00:47.279 --> 00:49.835
That's what I'm here for, to create better pilots.

00:50.134 --> 00:53.301
So, Scott, here's your video on VFR flight following.

00:53.555 --> 00:55.061
I hope all you guys enjoy.

00:55.620 --> 00:59.738
Hey everyone, Jason Schappert here of MzeroA.com,...

01:00.025 --> 01:05.771
...and this week I want to show you guys a little bit about flight following.

01:05.832 --> 01:10.662
VFR flight following and what a great service it can be to you guys,...

01:11.886 --> 01:13.421
...even on your short cross-country flights...

01:13.493 --> 01:15.961
...most especially on your longer cross-country flights.

01:16.321 --> 01:20.106
So, what I'm going to do is I'm gonna go ahead and let you guys listen to me...

01:22.341 --> 01:23.473
...pick up some flight following.

01:23.534 --> 01:26.042
Let's wait for a second here, we can try them on the radio.

01:27.866 --> 01:30.965
77287 maintain 7000.

01:31.457 --> 01:34.421
79 for 7000, 4773.

01:35.908 --> 01:39.180
Good afternoon, Jax Approach! Cessna 512 Romeo.

01:40.399 --> 01:42.658
512 Romeo, you said?

01:43.263 --> 01:44.900
Yes sir, Cessna 512 Romeo.

01:45.576 --> 01:46.941
512 Romeo, go ahead.

01:47.562 --> 01:51.649
Afternoon, sir, 512 Romeo, just off of Dunnellon Xray 35.

01:51.981 --> 01:54.784
Passing through 2,000 for 3,500.

01:55.047 --> 01:57.825
I'd like VFR flight following up to Saint Augustine...

01:57.929 --> 01:59.861
...Sierra Golf Juliett if you have a moment.

02:01.808 --> 02:04.970
November 512 Romeo Squawk 0427.

02:05.553 --> 02:07.978
0427 for 12 Romeo.

02:10.379 --> 02:13.617
And now all I'll be waiting for is him to come back and say his magic words,...

02:13.898 --> 02:17.551
..."radar contact", and he'll probably give me an altimeter setting for the local area.

02:33.937 --> 02:37.746
73 Mike, descending, maintain 5,000.

02:39.047 --> 02:41.223
73 Mike out of 745, thank you.

02:47.121 --> 02:50.557
November 512 Romeo radar contact 5 southwest of Ocala.

02:52.531 --> 02:53.901
12 Romeo, roger, thank you.

02:54.909 --> 02:56.369
Well, he didn't give us an altimeter setting.

02:56.504 --> 02:59.162
Typically they will, but hey, it changes every time.

02:59.238 --> 03:05.265
I really wanted you guys to see a little bit about VFR flight following...

03:05.567 --> 03:09.301
...and what a great service it can be to you guys as a pilot.

03:09.575 --> 03:13.441
So, go back and rewatch that transmission that I gave a few more times...

03:13.741 --> 03:20.382
...to help you guys better understand radio communications in the approach system...

03:20.682 --> 03:22.268
...and pick up VFR flight following.

03:22.336 --> 03:25.315
Hey, that's all I have for you guys this week, I hope you enjoyed it.

03:25.617 --> 03:27.721
Hope you have a chance to swing by while I'm at Southern fun.

03:27.799 --> 03:29.663
And most importantly guys, remember:...

03:30.273 --> 03:32.035
...a good pilot is always learning.

03:32.101 --> 03:33.299
Have a great day guys, see you!
