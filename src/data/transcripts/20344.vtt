00:08.387 --> 00:09.226
ï»¿Quiet on the set!

00:10.282 --> 00:11.757
Scene 4E, take two!

00:25.225 --> 00:30.396
The Hothouse is Boston University's student-run, client driven production company.

00:41.297 --> 00:46.415
The Hothouse assignment was to create a video for the client, "The NO Project"...

00:46.787 --> 00:49.711
...about human trafficking in modern society.

00:49.830 --> 00:53.095
The illegal slave industry is a 32-billion-dollar slave industry.

00:53.528 --> 00:54.527
It's a huge market.

00:54.791 --> 00:58.691
On a daily basis, we as consumers will buy products...

00:59.265 --> 01:03.406
...that contribute to slave trade and the slave problem.

01:03.557 --> 01:05.961
Well, slaves are involved from the very start...

01:06.062 --> 01:08.943
...of making most of the products that we use today like cell phones or,...

01:09.118 --> 01:11.618
...when it comes to a lot of the foods we eat.

01:12.365 --> 01:12.989
They farm it.

01:13.152 --> 01:13.814
They mine it.

01:14.276 --> 01:19.379
The idea of a slavery footprint originally came from a website called the slaveryfootprint.org.

01:19.959 --> 01:23.024
And on this website, you go through a series of survey questions...

01:23.123 --> 01:27.645
...that ask "Do you own an iPad?, Do you wear leather boots?, Do you buy coffee?"...

01:27.767 --> 01:33.653
...and at the end, it shows you how many slaves you actually own based on the things that you buy.

01:34.167 --> 01:37.953
It's something that we didn't know about until we were given this assignment.

01:38.299 --> 01:42.594
And it's just the idea that the simple day-to-day things that you do...

01:42.680 --> 01:45.965
...have a huge impact and a human impact behind them.

01:46.516 --> 01:50.589
What we're trying to do is spread awareness of modern-day slavery...

01:51.836 --> 01:56.656
...and one thing that we have to keep in mind is that we can't use words...

01:56.746 --> 01:59.778
...because this is an international PSA.

02:00.393 --> 02:03.665
There were a lot of challenges in writing a script without dialog...

02:04.628 --> 02:07.566
...primarily, the fact that I couldn't use dialogs.

02:07.653 --> 02:08.192
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

02:09.415 --> 02:10.754
Writing a script without dialog,...

02:10.825 --> 02:16.955
...I had to find a way to convey the exact message we want just through images.

02:17.317 --> 02:18.375
You have to see this!

02:18.661 --> 02:21.703
We couldn't literally like, have a rope attached to the product,...

02:21.937 --> 02:24.351
...like a little product that's really attached to it.

02:24.458 --> 02:29.237
We were surprised and shocked about the slaves behind all these day-to-day actions,...

02:29.299 --> 02:33.185
... and thought we should show the simple actions such as buying a cup of coffee...

02:33.698 --> 02:36.740
...and you walk out, and you literally just bought three slaves.

02:36.863 --> 02:40.239
And we just showed that to our viewer through the rope.

02:40.343 --> 02:45.903
We thought the ropes spoke for themselves and we didn't have to explain it as much.

02:45.989 --> 02:51.787
And it would have been something that was a little metaphoric of the whole situation...

02:51.863 --> 02:55.526
...of the bondage of keeping people enslaved...

02:55.656 --> 02:57.161
...and the ropes were a good symbol of that.

02:57.285 --> 03:00.381
It makes you feel like ashamed.

03:01.066 --> 03:02.277
We got used to the rope pretty quick.

03:02.762 --> 03:07.287
When we had to cut it all up, untie it, retie it, knot it,...

03:08.379 --> 03:11.889
...get it around a USB port to plug into a computer;...

03:12.413 --> 03:14.505
...all sorts of nifty things with the rope.

03:14.768 --> 03:19.252
The message of this video is spreading awareness of the situation,...

03:19.645 --> 03:24.469
...of the human trafficking issues that we deal with every day unknowingly.
