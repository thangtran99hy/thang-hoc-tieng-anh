00:16.373 --> 00:19.830
When I was young, I thought my country was the best on the planet,...

00:20.513 --> 00:23.402
...and I grew up singing a song called "Nothing to Envy."

00:24.375 --> 00:25.923
And I was very proud.

00:26.633 --> 00:30.123
In school, we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il-Sung,...

00:30.209 --> 00:32.942
...but we never learned much about the outside world,...

00:34.334 --> 00:38.342
...except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.

00:39.186 --> 00:41.863
Although I often wondered about the outside world,...

00:42.583 --> 00:45.863
...I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea,...

00:46.289 --> 00:48.431
...until everything suddenly changed.

00:49.978 --> 00:54.247
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution,...

00:54.969 --> 00:57.467
...but I thought my life in North Korea was normal.

00:58.153 --> 01:03.286
My family was not poor, and myself, had never experienced hunger.

01:03.760 --> 01:10.006
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from a coworker's sister.

01:10.388 --> 01:17.481
It read, "When you read this, all five family members will not exist in this world,...

01:18.281 --> 01:21.404
...because we haven't eaten for the past two weeks."

01:22.365 --> 01:30.275
"We are lying on the floor together, and our bodies are so weak we are ready to die."

01:33.969 --> 01:35.646
I was so shocked.

01:37.019 --> 01:41.046
This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering.

01:43.550 --> 01:46.468
Soon after, when I was walking past a train station,...

01:46.561 --> 01:50.111
...I saw something terrible that I can't erase from my memory.

01:51.760 --> 01:54.405
A lifeless woman was lying on the ground,...

01:54.884 --> 02:01.029
...while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother's face.

02:02.832 --> 02:04.191
But nobody helped them,...

02:04.761 --> 02:09.758
...because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families.

02:11.401 --> 02:14.933
A huge famine hit North Korea in the mid-1990s.

02:15.491 --> 02:19.859
Ultimately, more than a million North Koreans died during the famine,...

02:20.240 --> 02:25.413
...and many only survived by eating grass, bugs and tree bark.

02:27.055 --> 02:30.173
Power outages also became more and more frequent,...

02:30.333 --> 02:34.495
...so everything around me was completely dark at night...

02:34.781 --> 02:39.175
...except for the sea of lights in China, just across the river from my home.

02:39.854 --> 02:43.668
I always wondered why they had lights but we didn't.

02:45.583 --> 02:50.655
This is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night compared to neighbors.

02:53.027 --> 02:59.058
This is the Amrok River, which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China.

02:59.853 --> 03:03.494
As you can see, the river can be very narrow at certain points,...

03:03.908 --> 03:06.741
...allowing North Koreans to secretly cross.

03:08.339 --> 03:09.753
But many die.

03:10.086 --> 03:14.171
Sometimes, I saw dead bodies floating down the river.

03:17.685 --> 03:21.691
I can't reveal many details about how I left North Korea,...

03:22.538 --> 03:26.483
...but I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine...

03:26.553 --> 03:31.068
...I was sent to China to live with distant relatives.

03:31.897 --> 03:37.339
But I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time.

03:38.013 --> 03:42.988
I could have never imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
