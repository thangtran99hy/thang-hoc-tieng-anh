00:00.109 --> 00:00.680
Not good at math?

00:00.883 --> 00:04.220
Maybe 10,000 volts will motivate you to get better.

00:10.373 --> 00:13.359
Anthony here for DNews, and guess who's terrible at math.

00:13.659 --> 00:14.536
Hi, it's me.

00:14.827 --> 00:18.303
But it turns out there is a simple way to double your mental math abilities.

00:18.434 --> 00:20.043
Electric shocks to the brain!

00:20.991 --> 00:22.769
Okay, it is not quite as severe as it sounds.

00:23.002 --> 00:26.154
It's a process called Transcranial Random Noise Stimulation.

00:26.459 --> 00:28.218
And it's not anything you can really feel.

00:28.659 --> 00:31.607
A team led by Roi Cohen Kadosh at the University of Oxford...

00:31.743 --> 00:36.039
...grabbed 50 people and put some spooky looking electrode helmets on them.

00:36.133 --> 00:40.929
Twenty-five of the people had very low fluctuating electrical signals run through the helmets...

00:41.216 --> 00:45.007
...into specific parts of the brain including the prefrontal cortex,...

00:45.087 --> 00:47.055
...which is basically your math nerve region.

00:47.446 --> 00:50.677
The other 25 people had no current run through their helmet.

00:50.859 --> 00:55.431
And after five 40-minute brain shock sessions, the people who received TRNS...

00:55.516 --> 00:58.881
...showed crazy huge improvements in the ability to do math in their heads.

00:59.238 --> 01:01.495
They were twice as fast at doing calculations.

01:01.769 --> 01:03.912
They were also five times better at drill learning,...

01:04.167 --> 01:06.559
...which is stuff like memorizing multiplication tables.

01:06.763 --> 01:11.279
Even six months later, with no further treatment, the group that had TRNS...

01:11.392 --> 01:15.181
...could still do mental calculations 28 percent faster than the other group.

01:15.351 --> 01:16.781
So, what's going on?

01:16.956 --> 01:20.409
After measuring the flow of oxygen in the brain of both groups as they worked,...

01:20.741 --> 01:25.355
...Kadosh's team found out that TRNS makes the stimulated parts of the brain...

01:25.644 --> 01:28.955
...use their supply of oxygen and nutrients more efficiently.

01:29.262 --> 01:32.448
The shock makes your brain feed itself better.

01:32.703 --> 01:34.677
So, how do I do this at home?

01:34.829 --> 01:36.751
With a car battery and some chicken wire.

01:36.968 --> 01:37.795
No, wait.

01:37.991 --> 01:39.597
Let's talk about downsides first.

01:39.749 --> 01:40.842
Let's be smart for once.

01:41.189 --> 01:45.497
Kadosh says that even though the brain stimulation can improve certain cognitive functions,...

01:45.813 --> 01:48.835
...it could come at a cost to other functions.

01:48.903 --> 01:52.556
So, I guess if you boost the use of resources in one part of the brain,...

01:52.686 --> 01:54.673
...the other parts have to give some up.

01:55.103 --> 01:58.975
Now, Kadosh's team did check their participants for any unintended consequences,...

01:59.059 --> 02:01.719
...to non-math related tasks, and they didn't find any.

02:01.855 --> 02:05.670
But they want to do a more in-depth study on a larger group just to be sure.

02:05.785 --> 02:08.537
And I want to be a part of that study.
