For MSN News, I'm Candice Aviles.

00:05.852 --> 00:06.984
Here's a new one for you.

00:07.263 --> 00:12.307
A homeless man is 3,000 dollars richer today all because of his dancing moustache.

00:12.595 --> 00:14.315
This man identified as Clydesdale...

00:14.403 --> 00:17.914
...was captured by a prank group "whatever" making his moustache dance.

00:18.289 --> 00:20.965
As you might have guessed, his moustache isn't actually dancing;...

00:21.070 --> 00:22.950
...he is instead using his tongue to make it move.

00:23.229 --> 00:26.565
After the video went viral, the group set up a donation page for Clydesdale.

00:26.958 --> 00:30.221
The public responded to raise about 3,000 dollars for the homeless man.

00:31.396 --> 00:31.669
How are you?

00:33.691 --> 00:34.581
You've got to be kidding me.

00:35.193 --> 00:36.265
No, I'd rather not.

00:37.095 --> 00:38.054
I'm really speechless.

00:38.243 --> 00:38.914
I don't know what to do.

00:38.977 --> 00:39.858
I've got to go to my bank.

00:40.177 --> 00:40.662
I think so.

00:40.728 --> 00:41.469
We'll find a bank!

00:41.626 --> 00:44.067
Many YouTube commenters applauded the group's gesture.

00:44.208 --> 00:47.560
One commenter says, "That warmed my heart. You guys did a great job."

00:47.852 --> 00:49.549
We wouldn't be surprised if this reminds you...

00:49.652 --> 00:52.357
...of another YouTube field story of a homeless man.

00:52.599 --> 00:55.194
Remember Ted Williams, the man with the golden voice?

00:55.470 --> 00:57.687
When you're listening to nothing but the best of oldies,...

00:57.765 --> 00:59.886
...you're listening to Magic 98.9.

01:00.045 --> 01:04.132
The viral video led to job offers, talk show appearances and much, much more.

01:04.368 --> 01:09.371
The Huffington Post reports Williams now has a job doing voice overs for Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.

01:09.628 --> 01:13.030
In addition to the 3,000 dollars, the "whatever" group also gave Clydesdale...

01:13.099 --> 01:15.675
...a hat, two shirts and a smoothie gift card.

01:15.956 --> 01:18.190
Thanks for watching MSN News, I'm Candice Aviles.
