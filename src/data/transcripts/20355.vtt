ï»¿Technology giant IBM has created the tiniest film ever made,...

00:09.575 --> 00:14.388
...which involved shifting the location of individual carbon atoms to create the movie's frames.

00:14.730 --> 00:20.542
Guinness World Records has certified the 250-frame movie as the "Smallest Stop-Motion Film."

00:21.125 --> 00:23.583
To make this movie, essentially what we did,...

00:24.205 --> 00:28.498
...was we used a spectacularly sensitive type of microscope, the scanning tunneling microscope.

00:29.018 --> 00:32.167
We literally moved individual atoms rapidly around the surface...

00:32.615 --> 00:35.533
...and put them in one of the figures we wanted of a sequence,...

00:35.994 --> 00:37.117
...and then took a picture of that.

00:37.461 --> 00:39.929
We then moved them to a new position, took a picture of that,...

00:40.355 --> 00:42.830
...and each new position was a little different than the previous.

00:43.369 --> 00:47.871
That's how you make a movie a la the 1900s using technology a la the next century.

00:48.390 --> 00:50.827
The entire film, titled "A Boy and His Atom,"...

00:50.955 --> 00:55.517
...is made on a piece of material measuring only 45 by 25 nanometers.

00:55.805 --> 00:59.312
Some ten million nanometers fit into a single centimeter.

01:00.143 --> 01:03.042
In today's technology we've shrunken things so much, believe it or not,...

01:03.570 --> 01:06.539
...at the level of the transistors and all the devices we care about in the world...

01:06.599 --> 01:09.279
...as one example, we're down to the scale of atoms.

01:09.856 --> 01:12.821
Some of these elements are so small, some of the parts of the transistors...

01:12.886 --> 01:15.618
...and parts of technology, they're just atoms across.

01:16.255 --> 01:18.363
We need to think about what are we going to do in ten years...

01:18.427 --> 01:20.442
...when they become so small they no longer work.

01:21.109 --> 01:24.053
With current technology shrinking at such a rapid pace,...

01:24.117 --> 01:28.348
...it seems likely that the ability to move individual atoms in a precise manner...

01:28.426 --> 01:31.499
...will become crucial for the future of electronics manufacturing.
