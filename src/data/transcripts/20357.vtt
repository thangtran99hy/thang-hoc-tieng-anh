Hello!

00:06.995 --> 00:07.280
Check!

00:08.538 --> 00:10.243
Check and mate, my young friend.

00:13.789 --> 00:14.719
How about another challenge?

00:14.924 --> 00:16.883
You want to play a round of golf at the club and get some lunch?

00:17.088 --> 00:19.427
Whoever gets to the club last buys lunch.

00:19.799 --> 00:22.625
Stand by to have your wallet emptied by a tractor beam.

00:24.039 --> 00:26.077
Anything is possible but probably not that.

01:09.392 --> 01:11.672
In the middle of the Earth, in the land of the Shire...

01:11.751 --> 01:14.031
...lives a brave little hobbit whom we all admire.

01:14.899 --> 01:17.284
With his long wooden pipe, fuzzy, woolly toes,...

01:17.902 --> 01:20.137
...he lives in a hobbit hole and everybody knows him.

01:20.491 --> 01:21.003
Bilbo.

01:22.235 --> 01:23.335
Bilbo Baggins.

01:23.439 --> 01:25.051
The bravest little hobbit of them all.

01:25.556 --> 01:27.088
Yeah!

01:32.276 --> 01:33.725
Go, Bilbo!

01:34.859 --> 01:35.530
Call Leonard.

01:37.147 --> 01:37.691
Go!

01:38.228 --> 01:39.006
Hey, where are you?

01:39.370 --> 01:40.695
Use your sensors!

01:42.334 --> 01:43.044
No need.

01:43.573 --> 01:44.385
I'm already here.

01:44.815 --> 01:45.791
You're there already?

01:46.430 --> 01:47.916
I feel like I'm stuck in a black hole.

01:48.304 --> 01:51.309
No worries, I can practice my swing if you need to pull over and take a nap.

01:51.707 --> 01:52.474
Smart-ass.

02:01.645 --> 02:06.227
I have been and always shall be your friend.

02:07.051 --> 02:07.333
Really?

02:08.089 --> 02:08.455
I had you!

02:08.598 --> 02:09.186
Nice try.

02:09.278 --> 02:09.691
You missed.

02:09.766 --> 02:11.154
No, no, no, I definitely had you!

02:11.223 --> 02:11.871
Not for a second.

02:11.976 --> 02:14.029
Obviously, you're buying lunch.

02:14.121 --> 02:15.571
Technically, we are not inside yet.

02:17.675 --> 02:18.619
I'll see you inside.

02:40.875 --> 02:41.795
Fascinating.
