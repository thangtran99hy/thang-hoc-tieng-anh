My name is Mattias and I'm eight years old.

00:05.248 --> 00:07.701
My brother is Christian and he's ten, and he has autism.

00:08.139 --> 00:10.439
What I like about Christian is his sense of humor.

00:10.819 --> 00:12.147
He makes me laugh a lot.

00:12.526 --> 00:18.417
The most fun I have with Christian is when we go into the ocean and play.

00:19.231 --> 00:23.670
When Christian and I are in the ocean, you can't really tell Christian has autism.

00:24.017 --> 00:25.721
Chris would like to swim across the ocean.

00:25.987 --> 00:28.382
It's hard for him to talk and when he does,...

00:28.614 --> 00:32.406
...it's like, it just comes out not right.

00:32.528 --> 00:35.369
He has the words locked inside of him.

00:35.808 --> 00:39.101
Sometimes people stare and it's a little uncomfortable.

00:39.547 --> 00:45.643
At night, there's always a loud sound of Christian crying in the other room.

00:46.256 --> 00:49.725
It's one of the times that its hard to have a brother with autism.

00:50.021 --> 00:55.899
I would like the world to actually find something that could help Christian with his autism.

00:56.108 --> 00:57.869
April is Autism Awareness Month.
