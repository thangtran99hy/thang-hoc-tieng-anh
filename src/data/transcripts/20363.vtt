00:25.388 --> 00:26.839
Many hundreds of years ago,...

00:27.263 --> 00:30.335
...the good King Richard, known as Richard the Lionhearted,...

00:30.811 --> 00:33.079
...left England to take part in the Crusades,...

00:33.405 --> 00:36.421
...the war against the heathens who had captured the holy city.

00:37.305 --> 00:40.830
In his absence, he placed his brother John on the throne.

00:41.569 --> 00:46.191
As soon as he was king, John turned on the good nobles of the kingdom,...

00:46.341 --> 00:49.209
...stole their goods, and drove them out of England.

00:52.880 --> 00:57.623
Among these nobles were the old Earl of Huntingdon and his son, Robin.

00:58.371 --> 01:00.455
Father, I've come to say goodbye.

01:00.601 --> 01:02.231
Robin, where are you going?

01:02.357 --> 01:03.505
To Sherwood Forest.

01:03.627 --> 01:07.549
King John has declared me an outlaw, and an outlaw I will be!

01:11.500 --> 01:15.834
In Sherwood Forest, Robin Hood banded together with other young men like himself,...

01:16.053 --> 01:17.648
...banished by the wicked king,...

01:18.259 --> 01:19.820
...men like Will Scarlet.

01:20.421 --> 01:22.047
Outlaws we are, Will Scarlet,...

01:22.558 --> 01:26.189
...but outlaws such as never were before, and never will be.

01:26.373 --> 01:27.577
Just how do you mean, Robin Hood?

01:27.750 --> 01:30.693
I mean this Will, no let me show you.

01:31.731 --> 01:34.827
Do you see those two fat men coming down the road?

01:34.997 --> 01:35.781
I see them.

01:36.080 --> 01:36.903
A couple of merchants.

01:37.005 --> 01:38.194
Rogues and wealthy.

01:38.430 --> 01:42.679
And do you see that old woman in rags, weeping in sheer hunger?

01:43.189 --> 01:44.257
I see her, too.

01:44.501 --> 01:48.363
Well watch, and keep a hand to your arrow in case I need help.

01:51.712 --> 01:55.582
And so quickly, they became known far and wide.

01:56.097 --> 01:59.034
Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood Forest,...

01:59.631 --> 02:01.859
...taking from the evil to give to the poor,...

02:02.420 --> 02:04.435
...defenders of the weak and oppressed,...

02:05.057 --> 02:07.414
...the one hope of England's people!

02:10.365 --> 02:13.999
Sometime later, Robin set off by himself in the forest.

02:17.389 --> 02:20.299
He started across a bridge which lay across a stream,...

02:20.625 --> 02:23.430
...a bridge consisting of a single log of wood.

02:24.115 --> 02:27.425
But facing him, blocking the way, was a stranger,...

02:27.649 --> 02:30.785
...a tall man with broad powerful shoulders.

02:31.069 --> 02:34.237
I'm afraid there's only room for one of us to cross at a time.

02:34.531 --> 02:36.383
I think it ought to be the better man.

02:36.937 --> 02:38.177
Stand and fight!

02:42.096 --> 02:45.871
With only wooden sticks as weapons, they fought long and hard.

02:46.353 --> 02:48.843
Finally, with one quick powerful motion,...

02:49.167 --> 02:51.533
...the stranger knocked Robin Hood into the stream.

02:57.099 --> 02:59.079
Well, well done sir.

03:01.439 --> 03:02.581
What do they call you?

03:02.797 --> 03:04.254
John Little is my name.

03:04.377 --> 03:05.271
John Little.

03:06.451 --> 03:09.411
Well, I'll call you Little John.

03:10.210 --> 03:14.581
And I want you to join my band as my next in command!
