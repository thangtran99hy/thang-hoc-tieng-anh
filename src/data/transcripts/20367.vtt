00:02.947 --> 00:03.945
We're sort of like a team.

00:05.543 --> 00:07.506
"Earth's mightiest heroes" type of thing.

00:09.195 --> 00:10.477
Let's do a head count here.

00:10.805 --> 00:14.995
There's me, handsome billionaire genius, the prince of thunder,...

00:15.496 --> 00:19.926
...a super soldier, a few super spies and the new guy.

00:21.089 --> 00:25.411
Oh, and yeah, we have a Hulk.

00:26.669 --> 00:29.482
The Avengers, that's what we call ourselves.

00:31.571 --> 00:32.915
We're gonna need a team effort here.

00:34.113 --> 00:34.874
Let's do it!

00:41.493 --> 00:43.025
Avengers assemble!

00:45.742 --> 00:48.406
Do I know how to pick a team or what?

00:49.163 --> 00:49.966
I'm impressed.

00:50.039 --> 00:50.877
Of course you are.

00:52.323 --> 00:53.021
Show-off!
