00:06.589 --> 00:07.989
I've just had an apostrophe.

00:08.345 --> 00:09.909
I think you mean an "epiphany".

00:12.297 --> 00:13.944
How do you feel about apostrophes?

00:14.463 --> 00:17.265
A mountain naming committee in Thurman, New York recently learned...

00:17.340 --> 00:21.057
...that there's been a silent war of sorts being waged against the apostrophe.

00:21.591 --> 00:23.756
The specific name they wanted was being debated,...

00:23.921 --> 00:27.316
...but all of the top suggestions ended with apostrophe s,...

00:27.450 --> 00:31.927
...as the peak was being named to honor the local 1700s settler James Cameron.

00:32.643 --> 00:34.759
Apparently, that kind of punctuation use...

00:34.846 --> 00:39.521
...doesn't fly with The Domestic Names Committee of the US Board on Geographic Names.

00:40.173 --> 00:41.318
According to the agency,...

00:41.445 --> 00:46.505
...naming public places with an apostrophe s at the end implies too much individual possession,...

00:46.650 --> 00:49.353
...rather than giving an air of belonging to all of the people.

00:50.013 --> 00:52.926
In the 113-year history of the organization,...

00:53.109 --> 00:56.407
...a handful of possessive apostrophe attempts have made it through.

00:56.885 --> 01:00.571
Their most steadfast adherence to their rule doesn't mean that people approve of it.

01:01.005 --> 01:05.797
In 2009, the group was criticized at a meeting for its "isolationist stance".

01:06.357 --> 01:08.242
The British have encountered similar troubles,...

01:08.330 --> 01:12.827
...but in 2001, the Apostrophe Protection Society was founded in England...

01:12.917 --> 01:14.859
...to fight for the apostrophe's rights.
