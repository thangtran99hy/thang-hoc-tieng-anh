00:00.428 --> 00:04.807
So, our students have a facility with digital technology.

00:04.978 --> 00:09.670
And it's right and proper, therefore that we should build them into the heart of education.

00:10.285 --> 00:13.996
But it's also important we do it because the tools themselves...

00:14.333 --> 00:20.697
...are creating cultural change and possibilities which are really quite new.

00:21.258 --> 00:24.171
Our students are connected not just with the people in the room around them...

00:24.277 --> 00:26.751
...but with literally anybody on the planet they care to be connected to.

00:27.343 --> 00:31.743
And that's an entirely new cultural proposition, I think, and it changes the game.

00:32.449 --> 00:37.523
And my argument is that one of the reasons we have to transform education and we already do,...

00:38.019 --> 00:41.970
...is because the technologies have changed the whole context of education.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.749
But there are also among the ways in which the transformation itself will take place.

00:46.209 --> 00:52.154
So this shift, to me, is much more than a shift in the way we do art...

00:52.237 --> 00:54.695
...or the way we do design, although that's certainly the case.

00:54.920 --> 00:56.028
These tools are extraordinary there.

00:56.844 --> 00:59.833
They affect the way we think in all disciplines.

00:59.905 --> 01:01.655
They affect the way we think of disciplines.

01:01.721 --> 01:03.733
They affect the way disciplines interact.

01:04.266 --> 01:09.677
So these new tools seem to me, to be providing opportunities in the palette of possibilities...

01:09.900 --> 01:12.683
...which should be available to every single student, not just to a few.
