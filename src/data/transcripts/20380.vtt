Have you noticed your favorite celebs choosing high-tops over high heels lately?

00:06.343 --> 00:08.017
I'm Victoria Keelan with Buzz 60.

00:08.499 --> 00:12.637
A-list celebs like Jennifer Lopez are rocking a much more casual look these days...

00:12.719 --> 00:13.726
...when they hit the streets.

00:14.111 --> 00:17.741
It may be surprising to see supermodels like Gisele and Miranda Kerr...

00:17.957 --> 00:22.443
...ditching their stilettos in favor of sneakers, but these aren't just any sneakers.

00:22.839 --> 00:25.091
These high-tops have a built-in wedge heel...

00:25.303 --> 00:28.056
...that gives the height of a stiletto, but with total comfort.

00:28.607 --> 00:33.465
Some daring fashionistas like Kate Bosworth even pair them with skirts and dresses.

00:33.894 --> 00:38.057
Alicia Keys is such a fan of the trend, she launched her own pair with Reebok,...

00:38.193 --> 00:41.791
...and unlike some of the pricier versions, hers are less than a hundred bucks.

00:42.060 --> 00:46.456
Sporty brands like Lacoste and Puma have even gotten in on the wedge sneaker trend as well.

00:46.852 --> 00:48.627
Now, if you've got big bucks to spend,...

00:48.722 --> 00:53.850
...the Isabel Marant wedge sneakers are a celeb favorite but they run over $500.

00:54.115 --> 00:58.369
If you want to try the trend on the cheap, check out these styles from Steve Madden.

00:58.627 --> 01:02.714
The wedge sneaker trend definitely gives a whole new meaning to pumped up kicks.

01:02.976 --> 01:03.674

01:03.831 --> 01:05.188
Now you know, pass it on.
