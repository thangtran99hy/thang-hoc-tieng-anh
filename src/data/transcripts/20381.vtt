00:00.750 --> 00:03.128
Well, I was thrilled that "Lincoln" was a success...

00:03.297 --> 00:06.657
...and as I was thinking about what to do next,...

00:08.010 --> 00:09.794
...in the middle of the night, I woke up and it hit me.

00:10.553 --> 00:11.159
Obama.

00:12.115 --> 00:15.083
Picking the right actor to play Obama, that was the challenge.

00:15.219 --> 00:16.485
I mean, who is Obama really?

00:16.599 --> 00:17.119
We don't know.

00:17.697 --> 00:21.023
So I needed someone who can dive in and really become Barack Obama.

00:21.869 --> 00:24.671
And as it turns out, the answer was right in front of me all along.

00:25.747 --> 00:26.696
Daniel Day-Lewis.

00:27.533 --> 00:28.733
He becomes his characters.

00:28.969 --> 00:33.109
Hawkeye from "Last of the Mohicans" and Bill the Butcher from "Gangs of New York"...

00:33.201 --> 00:35.457
...and Abraham Lincoln in "Lincoln."

00:36.913 --> 00:37.332
And you know what?

00:37.622 --> 00:38.746
He nailed it.

00:40.280 --> 00:41.349
Was it hard playing Obama?

00:42.233 --> 00:43.227
I'll be honest, yeah, it was.

00:43.971 --> 00:45.311
This accent took a while.

00:45.594 --> 00:46.626
Hello, Ohio!

00:46.845 --> 00:47.793
Hello, Ohio!

00:48.061 --> 00:48.606
I love you back.

00:49.049 --> 00:49.174
Look.

00:49.816 --> 00:49.978
Look.

00:50.537 --> 00:51.671
Let me be clear about this.

00:52.223 --> 00:53.316
The cosmestics were challenging.

00:53.783 --> 00:56.034
You wouldn't believe how long it takes to put these ears on in the morning.

00:56.527 --> 00:58.015
I don't know how he walks around with these things.

00:59.895 --> 01:03.219
Once we had Daniel to play Obama, we had to cast the rest of his team.

01:03.742 --> 01:06.137
And I think we've got some pretty terrific performances.

01:06.521 --> 01:08.911
Working with a legend like Daniel is intimidating.

01:09.409 --> 01:10.919
But he makes everyone better.

01:11.292 --> 01:15.224
Without him, I never could have played Joe Biden, literally.

01:15.896 --> 01:17.377
Hi, I'm Joe Biden.
