ï»¿Hello.

00:05.597 --> 00:06.840
Kate, come check this out.

00:07.976 --> 00:08.505
Tennis player.

00:19.575 --> 00:20.506
You're eating my chocolate.

00:20.884 --> 00:22.193
We're gonna have to confiscate these.

00:22.261 --> 00:22.567
Why is that?

00:22.644 --> 00:23.309
It's a new policy.

00:23.437 --> 00:24.207
No chocolate balls.

00:24.721 --> 00:25.114
Okay.

00:25.439 --> 00:26.513
I think we should do a strip search.

00:26.660 --> 00:27.045
Excuse me?

00:27.151 --> 00:27.543
Definitely.

00:27.823 --> 00:28.569
Definitely a strip search.

00:28.631 --> 00:31.457
So if you could take off your pants, turn around.

00:31.667 --> 00:32.619
Is this really necessary?

00:32.686 --> 00:33.605
Stop. Right there.

00:33.740 --> 00:34.121
What's wrong?

00:34.271 --> 00:35.452
Nothing. Everything's right.

00:35.721 --> 00:36.503
You move very well.

00:37.056 --> 00:37.966
You must work out a lot.

00:38.701 --> 00:39.917
Oh yeah, that's the spot.

00:39.973 --> 00:40.773
People are watching this.

00:40.855 --> 00:41.730
Anyway, you're all done.

00:42.362 --> 00:42.743
Carry on.

00:44.178 --> 00:44.729
My chocolate?

00:44.929 --> 00:45.157
No.

00:45.412 --> 00:45.969
My chocolate.

00:46.563 --> 00:47.367
You ladies are crazy.

00:47.943 --> 00:48.446
Have a nice flight.

00:50.807 --> 00:51.131
Love you.
