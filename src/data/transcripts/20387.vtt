00:06.270 --> 00:07.115
Good night, Edith.

00:08.122 --> 00:08.905
Good night, Margo.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.327
Hold your horses.

00:10.436 --> 00:11.352
Who are you texting?

00:11.607 --> 00:12.197
My friend Avery.

00:12.566 --> 00:14.881
Avery, Avery?

00:15.087 --> 00:17.201
Is that a girl's name or a boy's name?

00:17.678 --> 00:18.661
Does it matter?

00:18.807 --> 00:21.683
No, no, it doesn't matter unless it's a boy!

00:21.799 --> 00:23.421
I know what makes you a boy.

00:24.315 --> 00:25.511
You do?

00:26.053 --> 00:27.144
Your bald head.

00:27.262 --> 00:28.659
Oh, yes.

00:28.850 --> 00:32.759
Sometimes I stare at it and imagine a little chick popping out.

00:35.155 --> 00:36.340
Good night, Agnes.

00:37.855 --> 00:38.897
Never get older.

00:42.405 --> 00:43.017
Mr. Gru?

00:43.197 --> 00:45.284
Agent Lucy Wilde of the Anti-Villain League.

00:46.095 --> 00:46.867
You're gonna have to come with me.

00:47.035 --> 00:48.867
Oh, sorry, I... Freeze Ray!

00:50.983 --> 00:53.826
You know, you really should announce your weapons after you fire them.

00:53.987 --> 00:59.673
For example, Lipstick Taser!

01:01.091 --> 01:02.905
Get in there.

01:28.365 --> 01:29.259
Hey! What the...

01:36.698 --> 01:42.747
We are the Anti-Villain League, dedicated to fighting crime on a global scale.

01:45.734 --> 01:47.565
A new villain has surfaced.

01:48.461 --> 01:52.151
You know how a villain thinks, that's why we brought you here.

01:54.913 --> 01:56.399
Pins and needles.

01:58.017 --> 02:01.371
I am the league's director, Silas Ramsbottom.

02:02.435 --> 02:02.793
Bottom!

02:05.744 --> 02:06.519
Hilarious.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.259
Are you really gonna save the world?

02:10.406 --> 02:11.725
That's right, baby!

02:11.846 --> 02:18.021
Gru is back in the game with cool cars, gadgets and weapons.
