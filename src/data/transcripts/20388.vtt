00:06.035 --> 00:11.463
When I interned with Citigroup in summer of 2005, I was in the Financial Entrepreneurs Group.

00:11.631 --> 00:12.644
It was a great experience.

00:12.813 --> 00:13.846
I got to learn a lot.

00:14.399 --> 00:17.311
I was actually able to work on some live transactions.

00:17.773 --> 00:21.348
Everyone wants to be on that live media, buy-side transaction,...

00:21.431 --> 00:23.082
...and to the extent that that's possible,...

00:23.232 --> 00:26.207
...you had to be at a firm where they're doing a lot of different types of deals.

00:26.563 --> 00:30.969
As long as you understand what you're doing and are interested in the work,...

00:31.371 --> 00:34.079
...you'll have a great summer experience and you'll get a full-time offer.

00:34.611 --> 00:37.005
We have one of the highest offer rates on Wall Street.

00:37.135 --> 00:40.808
We have about 80 to 90 percent of our summer interns, depending on the program,...

00:41.092 --> 00:43.295
...will be extended offers to join us full-time.

00:43.757 --> 00:48.366
It's a very select process that we go through to identify the best interns we can.

00:48.763 --> 00:50.811
And we want them here to work as analysts...

00:50.872 --> 00:52.856
...to see what it's like to be in the job full-time.

00:52.936 --> 00:53.808
They're not guests.

00:53.890 --> 00:54.965
They're not making copies.

00:55.341 --> 00:56.270
They're working on models.

00:56.364 --> 00:57.860
They're working on live transactions.

00:57.941 --> 01:00.953
They really get to see what the job of an investment banker will be like...

01:01.383 --> 01:03.105
...during the course of their ten-week internship.

01:03.640 --> 01:07.349
We have an incredibly robust social calendar for our interns over the summer.

01:07.672 --> 01:10.595
Part of what we want them to do is get to know the organization and our people,...

01:10.673 --> 01:12.862
...so we'll run lots of events for them to do that.

01:13.179 --> 01:14.920
But we also want them to get to know New York City,...

01:15.123 --> 01:18.227
...if they're going to be staffed here, or the branch offices where they're living.

01:18.553 --> 01:22.407
So it'll be a lot of opportunities to see the city, go to Broadway plays, et cetera.

01:22.833 --> 01:26.748
Our most senior professionals, including our CEO Chuck Prince and Bob Rubin,...

01:26.854 --> 01:29.341
...will come and speak to our interns over the course of the summer.

01:29.686 --> 01:32.741
So anything we can do to get them comfortable with the organization as a whole...

01:32.836 --> 01:34.155
...we're absolutely trying to do.

01:34.495 --> 01:37.279
We have upwards of 12 different opportunities...

01:37.359 --> 01:39.610
...a student might be able to choose from for the summer.

01:40.051 --> 01:45.799
Sales and trading, investment banking, corporate banking, capital markets, technology,...

01:46.100 --> 01:52.387
...operations, GTS, private banking, investment research, our finance division...

01:52.725 --> 01:56.412
...as well as various other programs within our Citibank consumer businesses.

01:56.965 --> 01:59.385
I think the most important thing is just to hit the ground running.

02:00.745 --> 02:03.386
You have to be ready for anything that comes up.

02:03.485 --> 02:06.748
You have to be excited and very passionate about the industry.

02:07.214 --> 02:10.186
You want to make sure that people give you a good rep...

02:10.272 --> 02:14.143
...going into your first and second week on the job because you only have ten weeks.

02:14.573 --> 02:17.202
And that ten weeks is up in a flash...

02:17.271 --> 02:20.047
...especially when you're working the top hours that we work in investment banking.

02:20.775 --> 02:23.701
I think the first thing any student has to do applying for an internship...

02:23.793 --> 02:26.711
...is to make sure their entire application is submitted online.

02:27.083 --> 02:28.477
In this technology-driven age,...

02:28.547 --> 02:31.269
...it's important that you have all of your information in the right place.

02:31.535 --> 02:32.773
Online is the first start.
