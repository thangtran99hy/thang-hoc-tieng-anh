I think my favorite thing about the concept for the diet Coke TV ad that we just shot...

00:03.837 --> 00:08.246
...is that one of the most amazing things about what I get to do...

00:08.328 --> 00:10.302
...is watching the process of writing a song.

00:11.510 --> 00:16.638
And then all the next steps that happen resulting in someone singing it in their car,...

00:16.712 --> 00:18.024
...someone singing it in their bedroom.

00:20.425 --> 00:22.132
I write on whatever I can find.

00:22.601 --> 00:24.343
I write wherever I am,...

00:24.442 --> 00:25.387
...whenever I get an idea.

00:25.472 --> 00:26.979
In the middle of the day, in the middle of the night.

00:27.371 --> 00:31.726
And I like that the commercial just really showcased that.

00:32.634 --> 00:34.575
I think one of my favorite things about the red tour is that...

00:35.007 --> 00:38.883
...one of the main focuses I had was incorporating the element of surprise...

00:38.955 --> 00:41.079
...and incorporating the unexpected.

00:41.639 --> 00:44.635
I like to think that a good concert can be like a good book.

00:44.783 --> 00:45.682
It can take you away.

00:45.760 --> 00:47.809
It can take you to a different place and help you escape.

00:48.362 --> 00:50.951
And I think that's the main goal for me:...

00:51.038 --> 00:55.323
...helping the fans to escape if only just for one night, you know.
