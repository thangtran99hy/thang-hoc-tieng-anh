00:05.847 --> 00:08.867
"ï»¿Typical" is a word I never use at Google in any context.

00:09.297 --> 00:13.231
We currently have over 900 students in our internship program.

00:13.483 --> 00:17.682
They can come through in the winter or the fall, the spring or the summer.

00:17.837 --> 00:21.187
We ask people to do at least three months here in their internship.

00:21.315 --> 00:25.981
We feel that gives them the best knowledge base of what a full-time employee does here,...

00:26.044 --> 00:27.739
...which is the goal of our internship program.

00:27.827 --> 00:31.226
I was an intern here at Google in the summer of 2006...

00:31.350 --> 00:33.904
...and then I returned full-time January 2007.

00:34.067 --> 00:35.715
I was in the software engineering department.

00:36.049 --> 00:40.266
And as an intern, I got to work on improving one of the products...

00:40.349 --> 00:41.539
...that they were working on at the time.

00:41.660 --> 00:42.591
It was really exciting,...

00:43.027 --> 00:47.763
...live code, actual work that would end up in production here at Google.

00:47.855 --> 00:50.025
I was an intern and it's still in production now.

00:50.106 --> 00:53.963
The two main areas are engineering and non-engineering.

00:54.118 --> 00:59.711
The requirements are very different depending on the position that you are interning in.

00:59.845 --> 01:06.274
As a general rule, we require people to be flexible, incredibly smart and creative,...

01:06.387 --> 01:07.625
...work in a team environment.

01:07.777 --> 01:12.258
For engineering, most of our interns have a computer science background,...

01:12.358 --> 01:16.320
...applied math background, know at least one coding language...

01:16.407 --> 01:18.047
...if they're going to work in development.
