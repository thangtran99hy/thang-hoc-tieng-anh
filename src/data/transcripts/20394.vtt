Ryan Martinez knows how to encourage his students.

00:06.297 --> 00:08.820
If there is silence, there is an opportunity for music.

00:09.083 --> 00:11.711
If there is a white surface, there's an opportunity for color.

00:14.775 --> 00:20.321
Martinez teaches French at Walter Johnson High School in Bethesda, Maryland outside Washington.

00:20.825 --> 00:24.597
His classroom is decorated with colorful ceiling tiles.

00:24.842 --> 00:28.041
As a teacher, you want to make your classroom space...

00:28.407 --> 00:31.463
...one that reflects your own approach to teaching.

00:31.533 --> 00:34.905
And when you make that an inviting, stimulating type of atmosphere,...

00:35.233 --> 00:37.657
...it makes it a more pleasurable learning experience.

00:38.081 --> 00:40.953
It started with one tile a year ago.

00:41.172 --> 00:41.828
I brought it home.

00:42.200 --> 00:47.011
I just had some blue paint and sort of just covered it, and then I installed it.

00:47.305 --> 00:48.188
The students noticed it.

00:48.347 --> 00:51.588
I mean, immediately, it jumped out because, in an otherwise white ceiling,...

00:51.704 --> 00:53.179
...all of a sudden you have some color.

00:53.472 --> 00:58.853
Martinez paints at home for ten hours each weekend and brings the tiles back to school.

00:59.421 --> 01:02.109
He has expanded the project to other classrooms.

01:03.103 --> 01:05.123
Maggie Mesorly teaches math.

01:05.623 --> 01:10.709
Students often think that math is boring, but they come in and see this art and they think,...

01:11.719 --> 01:13.331
"...maybe math isn't gonna be so boring."

01:13.607 --> 01:16.471
It can inspire creativity in their problem solving.

01:16.849 --> 01:20.377
Students can participate in the painting during their lunch breaks.

01:20.720 --> 01:22.190
This is a new experience for me.

01:22.382 --> 01:26.344
I think it's fantastic, and I can't wait 'til it's done.

01:26.834 --> 01:31.398
I've felt that if I painted ceiling tiles and saw how people reacted to it in the classroom,...

01:32.283 --> 01:37.373
...that it would probably boost my confidence a little bit about my drawing.

01:37.775 --> 01:42.066
Martinez says it helps students feel, in a sense, that they own the classroom.

01:42.739 --> 01:43.384
That's too much.

01:43.744 --> 01:46.279
He has expanded his project outside the school.

01:46.652 --> 01:48.936
Now, he regularly goes to Inwood House,...

01:49.068 --> 01:52.149
...a residential community for adults with disabilities.

01:52.718 --> 01:55.093
Meg Marshall is the community's manager.

01:55.405 --> 02:01.340
First it brightened up the room, and then it brightened up everyone's feelings.

02:01.534 --> 02:06.147
And then, they see their own artwork up on the ceiling; it's a very awesome feeling.

02:06.729 --> 02:07.484
Happy.

02:08.385 --> 02:10.851
Most of them have never painted before.

02:11.513 --> 02:14.384
What I would tell them was, "Just do it until you think it's done..."

02:14.548 --> 02:16.034
"...because that's what the most important thing is."

02:16.109 --> 02:19.567
And when you can get people to build that confidence in themselves,...

02:19.836 --> 02:23.610
...it's something that they can then apply in other facets of life as well.

02:25.559 --> 02:29.813
Ryan Martinez hopes his project will catch on in schools and beyond...

02:30.166 --> 02:32.475
...and bring more color to the world.

02:33.026 --> 02:34.565
For Producer June Soh,...
