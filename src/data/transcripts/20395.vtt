00:00.030 --> 00:02.147
So do you think we're alone in the universe?

00:03.041 --> 00:04.145
Are we the only intelligent life?

00:05.502 --> 00:05.883
No.

00:06.217 --> 00:12.440
I think there probably are many different kinds of life forms, a thousand organisms.

00:12.872 --> 00:16.884
Some may not be visible, some may not have been discovered...

00:16.991 --> 00:20.041
...and some may be on places we can't go.

00:20.763 --> 00:24.741
And they all might have the same perspective as we do on this:...

00:25.077 --> 00:30.933
...that there might be others and that maybe they can find them someday.

00:31.028 --> 00:34.727
But at the moment they don't know.

00:36.305 --> 00:37.749
They're part of a big world.

00:38.280 --> 00:41.381
Well, what do you think about the idea of alternate universes?

00:43.349 --> 00:48.062
I think it's realistic at the same time as it is fantasy.

00:49.464 --> 00:50.909
That's exactly what scientists think.

00:51.841 --> 00:53.669
They're not sure, they have the math to prove it...

00:53.809 --> 00:55.545
...but they haven't observed it so they don't know.

00:56.313 --> 00:59.150
Yeah, it's just very complicated...

00:59.726 --> 01:04.640
...because you have no proof that there's anything out there.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.828
The only proof is yourself.

01:07.297 --> 01:07.561
Right.

01:07.702 --> 01:10.611
And where you are in the universe.

01:12.454 --> 01:16.208
And you can only make theories, you can never know the truth.

01:16.380 --> 01:19.239
So what's the meaning of our lives here on Earth then?

01:20.757 --> 01:23.658
That's one of the hardest questions there is.

01:25.460 --> 01:30.085
I would say what the meaning of your life is, is what you make it.

01:30.721 --> 01:33.839
What you think, what you want your life to be.

01:34.609 --> 01:39.497
Nobody can decide what you will do except for you.
