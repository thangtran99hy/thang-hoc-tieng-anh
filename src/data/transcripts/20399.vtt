Hi, my name is Adam Elkins.

00:06.601 --> 00:11.087
I was an intern for PwC in the winter of '06 and I'm currently a tax associate.

00:11.867 --> 00:15.467
I found out about the internship through my career services at Ohio State.

00:16.033 --> 00:18.602
One of the most important things about my internship was...

00:19.200 --> 00:21.915
...it gave me a look at what it was really gonna be like when I was working here.

00:22.400 --> 00:25.735
It wasn't just making copies or scanning.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.623
I was actually doing tax returns for large hedge funds.

00:30.100 --> 00:34.089
My favorite thing about the internship was getting the real-life experience.

00:34.659 --> 00:36.912
My internship had a great impact on my career.

00:37.299 --> 00:39.134
The people here are wonderful too.

00:40.269 --> 00:42.623
The advice I have for future interns at PWC is...

00:42.975 --> 00:44.977
...take full advantage of the opportunities you have here.

00:45.530 --> 00:47.843
You can learn so much in so little time...

00:48.384 --> 00:51.076
...and you can apply that to your career later on with PricewaterhouseCoopers.

00:52.005 --> 00:55.462
The internship at PricewaterhouseCoopers is really a chance for...

00:56.100 --> 01:00.058
...students to come in and experience what a first-year associate would do.

01:00.795 --> 01:06.063
It's typically an eight-to-ten-week type of on-the-job training experience for them...

01:06.823 --> 01:09.279
...where they are able to work in one of our service lines.

01:09.602 --> 01:12.522
Ideally, we hire people between their junior and senior year...

01:13.200 --> 01:15.804
...or between their senior year and their fifth year master's.

01:16.491 --> 01:19.571
So we have interns that will come in to client service...

01:20.600 --> 01:23.017
...in the three service lines: Advisory, Tax and Assurance.

01:23.491 --> 01:26.197
We have about 2,700 interns each year.

01:26.850 --> 01:29.100
Our program is pretty robust between winter and summer...

01:29.437 --> 01:34.350
...and right now we average about 85 percent of those receiving full-time offers.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.831
To apply for an internship at PWC, you can go to our website.

01:39.624 --> 01:45.749
There's a careers website, pwc.com/lookhere that directs you into an online career profile.

01:46.150 --> 01:47.983
So once you complete your online career profile,...

01:48.398 --> 01:52.275
...any of the recruiters and any of our markets nationwide would be able to see your information...

01:52.800 --> 01:55.505
...and help to get you slotted into the appropriate interview process.
