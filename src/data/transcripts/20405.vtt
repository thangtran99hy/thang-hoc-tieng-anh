Climbing is a popular hobby among adrenaline junkies.

00:05.579 --> 00:09.291
The tower called the Excalibur is the world's tallest climbing wall.

00:09.953 --> 00:14.679
Located in Groningen, The Netherlands, the vertical structure stands 121 feet high.

00:15.423 --> 00:18.590
However, the most notable aspect is a bend in the design.

00:18.969 --> 00:21.747
From a distance, it appears as though the tower is tipping over.

00:22.244 --> 00:26.293
The curve tips 36 feet away from the base, serving as an overhang.

00:26.693 --> 00:30.478
That aspect replicates the grueling twists of climbing a real peak.

00:31.176 --> 00:34.901
The freestanding Excalibur was built in 2004 at a climb center.

00:35.318 --> 00:38.956
An employee at the facility stated, "The wall offers a unique experience...

00:39.030 --> 00:42.283
...for anyone interested in climbing and doesn't want to travel too far.

00:42.567 --> 00:45.939
The routes are of varying difficulty so beginners can climb on it, too.

00:46.347 --> 00:49.095
But don't expect to reach the top on your very first time."

00:49.856 --> 00:53.951
The outdoor tower is strategically set among the flat, picturesque countryside,...

00:54.115 --> 00:58.275
...which means adventure seekers can take in the beautiful views while scaling the structure.
