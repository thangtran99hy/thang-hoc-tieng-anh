Yet another awe-inspiring project has been completed in Dubai.

00:05.925 --> 00:12.401
It's called the Dubai Miracle Garden and covers a 72,000 square meter area in Dubailand.

00:13.023 --> 00:17.903
So how do you keep 45 million flowers hydrated in the middle of the desert?

00:18.442 --> 00:23.006
The garden's landscaper said the drip irrigation system uses recycled waste water.

00:23.588 --> 00:26.387
Residents and visitors have thronged to the garden.

00:26.794 --> 00:31.587
Kate Holbrooke, who has been a resident of Dubai for nine years, remarked to the Gulf News,...

00:32.027 --> 00:33.942
"...Why aren't they telling people about this?

00:34.213 --> 00:36.833
I've never seen such a beautiful sight as this."

00:37.479 --> 00:39.567
CNN notes the attraction isn't complete.

00:40.014 --> 00:43.086
Shopping outlets, restaurants and plant nurseries will be added...

00:43.208 --> 00:46.815
...during the second development phase, which kicks off mid-2013.

00:47.519 --> 00:49.334
The attraction is open to visitors now,...

00:49.451 --> 00:52.759
...but it will be closing during the hot summer months of June through September.

00:53.471 --> 00:57.432
Those who are happier pursuing winter activities and find out being in Dubai's sun...

00:57.521 --> 01:02.325
...can be too uncomfortable can head over to the Mall of Emirates and hang out at Ski Dubai.

01:02.799 --> 01:07.279
The snow-covered theme park has ski hills, a snow park, and, yes, real snow.
