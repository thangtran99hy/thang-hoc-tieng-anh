As many restaurants play the hospitality angle, it's important to remember that at large,...

00:07.420 --> 00:11.481
...their business is designed to get you to order as much food and drink as possible...

00:11.743 --> 00:15.446
...and then, of course, get you to leave quickly so they can seat the table again.

00:15.763 --> 00:20.284
As the host guides you to a tiny table located two inches away from another party,...

00:20.713 --> 00:24.363
...do you wonder why anybody would ever put tables that close together?

00:24.833 --> 00:29.191
There's a very good reason for the uncomfortable proximity: to make you uncomfortable.

00:29.755 --> 00:32.317
Diners who don't feel relaxed don't stick around.

00:32.663 --> 00:35.120
More table turns equals more profits.

00:35.615 --> 00:38.959
Sure, being offered a drink when you sit down is just plain polite.

00:39.211 --> 00:41.570
It's also a way to get you to order more.

00:42.013 --> 00:44.037
Alcohol stimulates the appetite.

00:44.489 --> 00:49.203
When you do open the menu, your eye is likely to gravitate towards the items on the right.

00:49.427 --> 00:51.955
That's probably where the most expensive ones are, too.

00:52.357 --> 00:55.763
Boxes and shaded areas serve to call attention to extras.
