Hello!

00:02.547 --> 00:02.879
Yeah, yeah. Hello.

00:03.243 --> 00:03.525
Hello.

00:04.452 --> 00:04.752
Who is this?

00:05.168 --> 00:05.490
It's me.

00:05.951 --> 00:06.135
Me who?

00:06.441 --> 00:06.656
Me who?

00:07.318 --> 00:07.784
Me, me.

00:09.719 --> 00:11.124
Want to have a better recall rate?

00:12.014 --> 00:15.741
A new study carried out by an associate professor at Montclair State University...

00:16.017 --> 00:18.353
...has found out by simply clenching your fist,...

00:18.567 --> 00:21.319
...memories and small details can be more easily recalled.

00:22.109 --> 00:25.026
Researchers asked more than 50 right-handed study participants...

00:25.109 --> 00:27.261
...to memorize 72 different words.

00:27.877 --> 00:30.429
They were assigned at random into varying hand clenching groups...

00:30.719 --> 00:32.477
...and then there was one group that did nothing.

00:33.278 --> 00:35.780
The researchers found that participants had better memory....

00:35.878 --> 00:37.937
...while clenching the right hand for memorizing...

00:38.167 --> 00:41.367
...and balling up the other hand while attempting to recall certain facts.

00:42.109 --> 00:45.428
The lead author states, "I would say that it would be worth trying."

00:45.799 --> 00:47.465
"Take parking your car in the parking lot."

00:47.986 --> 00:51.453
"As you park you can clench your right hand and when you're trying to find it,"...

00:51.792 --> 00:52.627
...clench your left hand."

00:54.032 --> 00:57.229
In another experiment, researchers from the University of Northumbria,...

00:57.810 --> 01:00.833
...found that the scent of rosemary might actually improve memory function.

01:01.275 --> 01:04.492
Research subjects performed better in a room that had a rosemary scent in it...

01:04.825 --> 01:05.777
...than rooms with no scent.
