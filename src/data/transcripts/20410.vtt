Researchers from the National Research Agency in France...

00:05.060 --> 00:07.468
...have found that infants as young as five months old...

00:07.548 --> 00:09.090
...show signs of conscious thought.

00:10.029 --> 00:12.277
By attaching electrodes to an infant's head,...

00:12.605 --> 00:16.397
...the neuroscientists were able to measure changes in electrical brain activity...

00:16.677 --> 00:19.688
...called event-related potentials, or ERP.

00:20.676 --> 00:27.017
The studies tried to use a sample group of 240 babies age five, ten, and 15 months,...

00:27.497 --> 00:29.922
...but only 80 of them were able to complete the study.

00:31.016 --> 00:33.181
The subjects who were one year or older...

00:33.385 --> 00:37.271
...had an ERP that was three times slower than an adult's reaction time.

00:38.240 --> 00:42.062
Younger subjects also exhibited ERPs that were slower...

00:42.334 --> 00:45.253
...and a little bit different from adult ERP patterns.

00:46.011 --> 00:48.789
Results of the study show that the basis for conscious thought...

00:49.143 --> 00:50.697
...might be present in infants,...

00:51.059 --> 00:54.251
...and the researchers think that the same electrical brain patterns...

00:54.345 --> 00:57.427
...might be happening to children as young as two months old.

00:58.646 --> 01:00.999
Some scientists think that the actual results...

01:01.297 --> 01:04.247
...may not warrant the presence of consciousness as we know it.

01:04.977 --> 01:05.915
According to critics,...

01:06.085 --> 01:09.870
...using data on brain activity and functional magnetic resonance imaging...

01:10.007 --> 01:14.243
...is not enough to definitively say that the babies possess consciousness.
