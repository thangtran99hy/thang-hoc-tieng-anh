Ever notice that country rain smells so much better than city rain,...

00:13.051 --> 00:14.803
...especially after a long dry spell?

00:15.601 --> 00:19.338
In short, it's because the smell of rain isn't in the droplets themselves but...

00:19.434 --> 00:21.782
...is a blend of environmental contributions.

00:22.530 --> 00:27.361
For nature to produce that sweet, clean, fresh smell, it needs, well, nature.

00:28.092 --> 00:31.459
Plants are a key contributor, especially after periods of drought.

00:31.717 --> 00:35.576
In arid times, some plants secrete essential oils into the environment.

00:35.825 --> 00:39.137
When the rain finally comes, the aromas are released into the air.

00:39.947 --> 00:43.057
These airborne scents mix with those wafting from forests...

00:43.185 --> 00:45.836
...where moist conditions foster the growth of geosmin,...

00:46.045 --> 00:48.688
...a chemical produced by soil-loving bacteria.

00:49.004 --> 00:52.360
The pounding of the rain releases their musty yet pleasing aroma.

00:53.192 --> 00:58.054
The third major ingredient is ozone, which provides the clean, almost chlorine-like, notes.

00:58.950 --> 01:02.959
Beyond its chemistry what makes it so appealing could be explained by evolution.

01:03.768 --> 01:08.426
Anthropologist Diana Young, based on her cultural studies in West Australia,...

01:08.657 --> 01:11.485
...found that people associated rain with the promise of growth...

01:11.608 --> 01:13.059
...and replenished food supplies.
