It's Taipei's newest hotspot: a ninja-themed restaurant.

00:09.650 --> 00:11.231
From the outside, you can't miss it:...

00:11.501 --> 00:14.011
...orange-clad ninjas crawl up the side of the building,...

00:14.486 --> 00:17.681
...but enter the dining room and you may have trouble locating the door,...

00:17.920 --> 00:19.586
...it's hidden under a waterfall.

00:23.271 --> 00:26.474
I think the idea is really cool, normal people wouldn't think about it.

00:26.934 --> 00:29.024
The door we came through though, is really special.

00:29.481 --> 00:31.956
You can only see the waterfall and you wonder what to do,...

00:32.491 --> 00:33.517
...then you realize it's a door.

00:35.367 --> 00:38.849
Once inside, customers can choose from a menu of Japanese cuisine...

00:38.969 --> 00:40.477
...listed on paper scrolls.

00:40.965 --> 00:43.759
Patrons are served by waitresses in ninja outfits...

00:43.833 --> 00:47.343
...who wield swords and pens that look like throwing darts.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.323
Some of the customers take the swords,...

00:52.761 --> 00:54.625
...so we are going to write something on them,...

00:54.987 --> 00:58.199
...for example, sea cucumber or maybe drinks,...

00:58.454 --> 01:00.412
...and you will get what you see on the sword.

01:00.867 --> 01:05.160
But if it says 200 in tips, then you have to tip us 200.

01:07.569 --> 01:10.135
Big tips or not, Taiwan's Ninja Restaurant...

01:10.207 --> 01:12.760
...is giving new meaning to eating on the edge.
