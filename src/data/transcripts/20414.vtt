00:00.437 --> 00:04.685
Imagine boarding a plane without security checks, turbulence or even ticketing.

00:05.080 --> 00:06.849
And there's more than just peanuts for dinner.

00:07.297 --> 00:11.596
Since last November, an entrepreneur in Taipei has been providing this sort of service...

00:11.864 --> 00:13.462
...to people who love to fly.

00:15.852 --> 00:20.218
Packing in the passengers, the restaurant looks and almost functions like an airliner...

00:20.425 --> 00:23.093
...but sells a full menu's worth of Western food.

00:23.568 --> 00:28.069
Diners at A380 in-flight kitchen sit in soft speckled blue seats...

00:28.381 --> 00:31.207
...graced with white napkins under oval-shaped windows.

00:31.431 --> 00:34.089
Locked white baggage compartments hang overhead.

00:34.463 --> 00:39.217
Waitresses dressed as flight attendants take meal orders for filet mignon or waffles...

00:39.453 --> 00:42.270
...as well as the customary fish and chicken standbys.

00:42.535 --> 00:45.542
Customers say they love the in-flight experience.

00:48.419 --> 00:50.683
This restaurant looks like a real airplane.

00:50.808 --> 00:52.065
It's fun and amusing.

00:54.536 --> 00:57.077
We come here often, this is quite special.

00:57.371 --> 01:01.594
My daughter likes going on airplanes, but we don't have that many opportunities to,...

01:01.810 --> 01:04.347
...so coming here gives her that experience.

01:04.863 --> 01:07.312
While airline food doesn't usually taste good,...

01:07.479 --> 01:10.449
...this restaurant has the food problem fixed on the ground.

01:13.139 --> 01:16.169
Initially we saw A380, the luxury Airbus,...

01:16.375 --> 01:19.861
...and wished to combine the food on the ground and the flight experience.

01:20.020 --> 01:24.617
We had the concept of dining in a passenger compartment, then came up with the menu.

01:24.975 --> 01:29.397
After the interior renovation, we extended the idea to in-flight services.

01:30.026 --> 01:33.095
The diner decor cost about $200,000.
