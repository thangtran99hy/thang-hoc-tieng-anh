Where would science be without the occasional accidental discovery?

00:03.459 --> 00:05.363
Hey guys, I'm Patrick Jones for Buzz 60.

00:05.581 --> 00:07.271
Especially when it comes to medicine.

00:07.463 --> 00:13.325
Penicillin was discovered when Sir Alexander Fleming left his experiments for a two-week vacation...

00:13.583 --> 00:17.365
...only to come back and find that a Petri dish culture of bacteria...

00:17.445 --> 00:20.203
...was contaminated with a fungus that was killing it.

00:20.447 --> 00:22.983
He decided to call it mold juice,...

00:23.211 --> 00:26.911
...but a few months later decided to get all sciency and call it penicillin.

00:27.177 --> 00:31.401
Viagra was accidentally found when looking for a high blood pressure cure.

00:31.638 --> 00:33.288
Now it facilitates the opposite.

00:33.548 --> 00:35.281
The microwave was stumbled upon...

00:35.361 --> 00:40.038
...when a magnetron inspector felt a candy bar all of a sudden melt in his pocket.

00:40.305 --> 00:45.420
Alfred Nobel, yes, the Nobel Prize Nobel, discovered dynamite the hard way...

00:45.573 --> 00:51.272
...after several experiments in tending to learn how best to store explosives went wrong.

00:51.452 --> 00:55.065
One attempt even ended in fatalities including Nobel's brother.

00:55.276 --> 00:57.488
Nobel figured out the idea behind dynamite...

00:57.553 --> 01:01.256
...after nitroglycerin powder leaked onto some damp sediment.

01:01.427 --> 01:06.117
Meaning the Nobel Prize is named after a guy who despite several accidents...

01:06.206 --> 01:08.347
...still had explosive powder leaking.

01:08.516 --> 01:10.330
Buzz 60 now you know, pass it on.
