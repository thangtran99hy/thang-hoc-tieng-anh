These are the voyagers of the Starship Enterprise.

00:04.745 --> 00:09.444
Star Trek's starship is well-known to viewers of the iconic TV series...

00:09.638 --> 00:13.272
...and visitors to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum's gift shop...

00:13.699 --> 00:15.667
...where the original model is on display.

00:16.185 --> 00:20.409
The fictional craft even inspired the name of NASA's prototype space shuttle...

00:20.547 --> 00:22.997
...says museum curator Margareth Weitekamp.

00:23.362 --> 00:26.684
Well, the very first space shuttle was actually named the "Enterprise"...

00:26.833 --> 00:31.706
...as a result of a writing campaign orchestrated by Star Trek fans of the 1970s.

00:31.843 --> 00:35.875
That is just one indication of Star Trek's influence, says Weitekamp,...

00:36.173 --> 00:39.921
...who recently appeared on the panel at the museum about Star Trek's relevance.

00:40.333 --> 00:46.869
She notes the TV series began airing in the 1960s as women and minorities pressed for equal rights.

00:47.471 --> 00:53.907
Star Trek has been a really important vision, not only of what future space flight could look like,...

00:54.031 --> 00:58.767
...but also a reflection of what the hopes were, especially in the 1960s,...

00:59.093 --> 01:00.748
...for what human society could look like.

01:00.829 --> 01:03.602
So, very importantly in 1966,...

01:03.914 --> 01:10.177
...it's a mixed-sex, racially integrated, multinational space crew that even includes an alien.

01:10.479 --> 01:14.432
The original series also showed technologies that have become reality,...

01:14.585 --> 01:18.253
...says Nancy Reagin, editor of the book "Star Trek and History."

01:18.417 --> 01:21.595
You see the first depiction of a plasma screen TV.

01:21.751 --> 01:24.865
You see the first depiction of what I would call a cell phone,...

01:25.187 --> 01:28.583
...the communicators, they sort of flip open just like the first cell phone that I ever had.

01:29.341 --> 01:32.215
You see the first example of Bluetooth technology...

01:32.311 --> 01:34.777
...where Uhura is wearing the little Bluetooth in her ear.

01:35.259 --> 01:38.605
You see the first use of tablets where they're using multi-touch pads.

01:38.845 --> 01:43.770
Star Trek still inspires engineers, says Mike Gold of Bigelow Aerospace,...

01:43.905 --> 01:47.627
...a Nevada-based company that is developing next generation spacecraft.

01:47.823 --> 01:50.417
I'd like to think that our entire program...

01:50.534 --> 01:53.217
...is again very much in keeping with the spirit of Star Trek,...

01:53.344 --> 01:57.157
...which is to push the boundaries for human exploration.

01:57.396 --> 02:00.029
He says the Bigelow Expander Activity Module...

02:00.141 --> 02:03.503
...will be tested on the International Space Station in 2015.

02:03.868 --> 02:06.886
Its acronym BEAM harkens back to Star Trek.

02:08.083 --> 02:09.057
Scotty, beam me up!

02:09.653 --> 02:14.435
The newest movie "Star Trek Into Darkness" appeals to fans old and new.

02:15.088 --> 02:18.896
The film's stars and writer, NASA astronauts and fans...

02:22.007 --> 02:26.098
Star Trek fires up the imagination, says astronaut Kjell Lindgren.

02:26.467 --> 02:30.217
That's one of the real fun things about these movies and science fiction in general.

02:30.285 --> 02:34.145
It's just that opportunity to imagine what the future could be like...

02:34.218 --> 02:35.787
...and what technology is going to be like.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.341
Star Trek has been a part of popular culture for nearly 50 years.

02:39.541 --> 02:41.948
And with yet another movie in the planning stages,...

02:42.258 --> 02:46.381
...it will continue to inspire people to think about space, the final frontier.
