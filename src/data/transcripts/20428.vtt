00:01.639 --> 00:10.208
On behalf of the great state of Illinois, "Crossroads of the Nation", "Land of Lincoln",...

00:11.580 --> 00:16.529
...let me express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention.

00:18.325 --> 00:21.181
Tonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it,...

00:22.004 --> 00:25.056
...my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely.

00:26.736 --> 00:31.823
My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya.

00:33.434 --> 00:37.281
He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin roof shack.

00:37.631 --> 00:43.031
His father, my grandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant to the British.

00:44.476 --> 00:46.947
But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son.

00:47.580 --> 00:49.530
Through hard work and perseverance,...

00:49.996 --> 00:54.255
...my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America,...

00:54.927 --> 00:59.644
...that's shown as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before him.

01:03.049 --> 01:06.324
While studying here, my father met my mother.

01:07.552 --> 01:11.271
She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas.

01:16.966 --> 01:20.815
Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression.

01:21.873 --> 01:26.177
The day after Pearl Harbor, my grandfather signed up for duty,...

01:27.076 --> 01:29.129
...joined Patton's army, marched across Europe.

01:30.065 --> 01:35.194
Back home, my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line.

01:36.537 --> 01:43.100
After the war, they studied on the GI Bill, bought a house through FHA and later moved west,...

01:43.431 --> 01:45.823
...all the way to Hawaii, in search of opportunity.
