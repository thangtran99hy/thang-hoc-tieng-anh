00:17.719 --> 00:23.976
Most of us have abandoned our home in hopes of finding a new life among the stars.

00:24.597 --> 00:28.769
We do not know how many of our brothers escaped Megatron's blockade.

00:29.723 --> 00:31.496
I can only be certain of this:...

00:32.502 --> 00:34.868
...just one transport remains.

00:35.533 --> 00:36.330
I'm Peter Cullen.

00:36.417 --> 00:38.296
I'm playing the part of Optimus Prime.

00:38.385 --> 00:43.134
We're recording a video game called "Transformers: Fall of Cybertron."

00:43.583 --> 00:44.979
The characters are so rich.

00:45.245 --> 00:47.289
And they're so very, very true.

00:48.022 --> 00:52.863
The constant skirmish between good and evil, and Megatron and Prime;...

00:53.420 --> 00:55.303
...the Decepticons and the Autobots.

00:55.768 --> 01:00.139
You see where it was born, and you become really entrenched in it.

01:00.332 --> 01:01.773
You become involved; you want to know.

01:02.343 --> 01:03.812
Everybody loves playing as Optimus Prime,...

01:03.944 --> 01:05.138
...leader of the Autobots...

01:05.312 --> 01:09.064
...and he's arguably one of the most powerful Transformers that's ever been created.

01:09.149 --> 01:12.808
When you take control of Optimus, you're going to feel super powerful.

01:12.915 --> 01:15.349
He is the leader of the Autobots for a reason...

01:15.586 --> 01:17.497
...and we've designed a game to make you feel that way.

01:18.111 --> 01:19.175
I love the way he's written.

01:21.468 --> 01:25.179
He brings to life so many great character principles:...

01:26.048 --> 01:31.211
...the trustworthiness and courage; the integrity, honor, dignity.

01:31.921 --> 01:36.950
It's important to me that those elements remain very, very rich and alive.

01:37.260 --> 01:40.607
Doing Prime, although he's consistent, doing a movie,...

01:40.736 --> 01:45.217
....and doing an episodic television series and then doing a video game;...

01:46.613 --> 01:49.067
...although the character remains the same,...

01:49.684 --> 01:53.144
...there's a different intensity and different approaches.

01:53.443 --> 01:57.186
But this "Transformers: Fall of Cybertron" is a lot different.

01:57.587 --> 02:02.475
It has the elements of emotion, and there's a lot of relation to character.

02:02.913 --> 02:05.223
And so this game is not only fun to do,...

02:05.785 --> 02:09.909
...but it seems much more of an involvement into a story...

02:10.213 --> 02:14.251
...and I think that is going to be the real kick for it, I think.

02:15.073 --> 02:16.935
Till all are one.
