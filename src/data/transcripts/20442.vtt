Okay, we've all been told that losing weight is simple.

00:09.031 --> 00:10.827
All we need to do is eat less.

00:11.590 --> 00:16.793
This brilliant idea is based on the belief that the human body is also simple.

00:17.308 --> 00:19.327
But unfortunately, it's not.

00:20.157 --> 00:23.236
Let's take a look at what happens when you do eat less.

00:24.109 --> 00:27.929
If we eat fewer calories, let's say 500 calories less each day,...

00:28.563 --> 00:31.621
...the first thing that happens is that our bodies feel hungry.

00:32.585 --> 00:34.995
To replace the missing energy from lack of calories,...

00:35.332 --> 00:40.389
...the body will start to look for energy elsewhere and it turns to muscle mass first.

00:40.837 --> 00:45.223
Because muscle is easier for the body to burn, muscle will be used before fat.

00:45.711 --> 00:50.005
So eating less drives the body to break down muscle which means we are losing weight.

00:50.379 --> 00:55.723
But in the long term, losing muscle makes maintaining weight loss really difficult.

00:56.335 --> 01:00.443
After a while, burning muscle as energy and eating less on a low-calorie diet,...

01:00.791 --> 01:04.144
...the body's metabolism slows down.

01:04.732 --> 01:10.075
Now, once the body's metabolic rate has slowed down, we can only retain our new weight...

01:10.299 --> 01:13.583
...by holding our calorie intake at the new reduced level.

01:14.075 --> 01:17.195
So if we do return to our normal diet, we'll regain weight.

01:17.744 --> 01:21.137
And the weight we regain will be fat rather than muscle.

01:21.869 --> 01:24.924
However, if we follow a diet high in protein...

01:25.004 --> 01:29.192
...like a real food ketogenic diet and cut out sugar and starch,....

01:29.576 --> 01:34.819
...our bodies will burn fat as energy and we won't damage our metabolic rate,...

01:35.096 --> 01:38.805
...as the protein in the diet will replenish any muscle the body may have burned.

01:39.411 --> 01:44.531
Even better, the high protein will keep us feeling fuller for longer.

01:45.212 --> 01:50.601
So, by following our low starch, low sugar, high protein diet, we feel full.

01:51.049 --> 01:57.408
Our metabolic rate is protected, we sustain our inch loss, and we burn fat and not muscle.

01:57.933 --> 01:58.990
And that's good.
