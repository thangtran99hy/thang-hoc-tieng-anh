What do you think when I say the 80s?

00:04.251 --> 00:04.771
Big hair?

00:05.092 --> 00:05.863
Shoulder pads?

00:06.461 --> 00:08.803
Some people think it was a decade we could have done without.

00:09.545 --> 00:12.160
But without the 80s, you wouldn't have your smartphone.

00:12.959 --> 00:14.115
You'd have no Internet.

00:14.851 --> 00:16.909
Video games would still be stuck in arcades.

00:17.297 --> 00:19.428
Music would have never made it out of your home...

00:19.797 --> 00:22.134
...and hip-hop would have never made it out of the Bronx.

00:24.273 --> 00:27.344
In the 80s, a disaster made NASA think differently.

00:28.128 --> 00:29.775
And he made us all think different.

00:31.639 --> 00:32.863
Sure, you'd have seen a moonwalk,..

00:34.449 --> 00:37.803
...but you wouldn't have seen the moonwalk or the "Hand of God."

00:40.527 --> 00:42.577
Germany would still be in two halves.

00:43.277 --> 00:47.937
And if a Russian officer named Stanislav had pressed that button, we wouldn't exist at all.

00:49.110 --> 00:51.868
See how ten dramatic years defined our world.

00:52.542 --> 00:54.744
Watch "The 80s: The Decade that Made Us."

00:55.375 --> 00:57.378
Coming soon on National Geographic.
