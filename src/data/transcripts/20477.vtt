ï»¿Most of us eat a diet which is based on potatoes, wheat, rice and sweet things.

00:11.202 --> 00:13.743
Whilst starch and sugar may look very different,...

00:14.055 --> 00:16.916
...they're actually digested by the body in a similar way.

00:17.447 --> 00:22.228
They both turn into glucose in the bloodstream, which is known as blood sugar,...

00:22.553 --> 00:24.953
...and it's just cheap, fast energy for the body.

00:25.486 --> 00:28.426
Some of these foods turn into glucose faster than others...

00:28.548 --> 00:31.359
...but ultimately they all turn into blood sugar.

00:31.780 --> 00:35.601
Now the problem with blood sugar is that if we don't use it relatively quickly,...

00:35.763 --> 00:37.235
...it becomes toxic.

00:37.984 --> 00:40.313
So the body has developed a very effective way...

00:40.397 --> 00:43.401
...to remove excess blood sugar from the bloodstream.

00:43.805 --> 00:46.827
It has a faithful dog called Insulin to fetch it.

00:49.183 --> 00:52.612
Insulin retrieves the excess, unused blood sugar in the bloodstream...

00:52.679 --> 00:55.835
...and then stores a little as glycogen in our muscles and liver,...

00:56.317 --> 01:01.295
...but stores most of it as fat in our bodies, mostly around our tummies.

01:02.063 --> 01:04.479
Now, as long as we keep eating starch and sugar,...

01:04.757 --> 01:09.763
...Insulin will keep retrieving unused blood sugar and store it as fat as fast as it can.

01:11.175 --> 01:14.531
And we get fatter and fatter and, well, fatter.

01:15.193 --> 01:15.961
Poor old Insulin.

01:16.476 --> 01:18.342
He's a very tired dog.

01:19.792 --> 01:24.505
If we keep eating starch and sugar and, poor old us, we'll have a large store of fat...

01:24.652 --> 01:28.899
...which is actually just unused blood sugar from eating starch and sugar.

01:29.295 --> 01:34.109
So, hopefully you can now see how foods that don't actually look like fat...

01:34.493 --> 01:37.081
...can become fat in our bodies.
