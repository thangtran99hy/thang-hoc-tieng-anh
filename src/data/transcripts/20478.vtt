I'm Dr. Mike Roizen with a simple smart tip if you're trying to lose weight.

00:08.573 --> 00:10.058
Try a new fruit.

00:10.670 --> 00:12.948
Fill up your fruit bowl and get creative.

00:13.263 --> 00:16.557
These are three fruits that are a great place to start.

00:17.059 --> 00:20.466
Guava: It's rich in disease-fighting polyphenols...

00:20.743 --> 00:23.789
...and can fill you up faster than blueberries or raspberries.

00:24.288 --> 00:29.047
Just one 37-calorie guava has three grams of fiber.

00:29.413 --> 00:32.416
Lychee is also packed with polyphenols.

00:32.741 --> 00:36.468
And this tiny fruit has only six calories.

00:36.705 --> 00:40.507
You can add it to celeries for extra flavor and dimension.

00:40.787 --> 00:45.090
Papaya has loads of Vitamin C, which is great for your skin.

00:45.617 --> 00:50.176
Vitamin C helps your body produce collagen, which makes your skin resilient.

00:50.395 --> 00:52.561
These help keep your skin smoother.

00:53.267 --> 00:55.095
Add a medium-sized papaya.

00:55.353 --> 00:57.800
It's only 119 calories.

00:58.019 --> 01:01.170
