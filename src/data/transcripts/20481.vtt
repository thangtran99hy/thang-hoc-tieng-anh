In a recent interview with Charlie Rose on "60 Minutes",...

00:05.609 --> 00:08.939
...Microsoft founder and chairman Bill Gates spoke emotionally...

00:09.023 --> 00:12.726
...about his last visit with Apple founder and CEO Steve Jobs.

00:12.813 --> 00:16.866
Gates welled up at the memory of his last conversation with Jobs in May 2011.

00:16.959 --> 00:17.991
And talked about what?

00:18.452 --> 00:23.522
All about what we've learned, about families, anything.

00:23.655 --> 00:27.093
The conversation was positive for the two friends and former rivals.

00:27.465 --> 00:32.302
No, he was not being melancholy like you know, "Oh, I've been gypped."

00:32.391 --> 00:37.613
He was very forward-looking about, "Oh, we haven't really improved education with technology."

00:37.735 --> 00:38.541
You know, "What do you think?"

00:38.629 --> 00:41.215
Gates also admitted Jobs was the better designer...

00:41.320 --> 00:44.649
...after Rose asked what Jobs had that he wished he'd had.

00:44.724 --> 00:48.964
Oh, his sense of design, that everything had to fit a certain aesthetic.

00:49.466 --> 00:53.625
The fact that he, with his little engineering background as he had,...

00:53.794 --> 00:57.615
...it shows that design can lead you in a good direction.

00:57.870 --> 01:00.905
And so, phenomenal products came out of it.
