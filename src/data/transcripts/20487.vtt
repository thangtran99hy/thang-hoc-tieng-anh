So you're all set to do your audition for the You Generation.

00:03.535 --> 00:04.723
But practice makes perfect,...

00:04.983 --> 00:08.325
...so you're gonna want to rehearse it beforehand with your friends over Skype.

00:08.423 --> 00:08.965
Mine are here.

00:09.297 --> 00:09.748
Hello.

00:09.841 --> 00:10.559
Hi, Matt.

00:10.757 --> 00:14.494
Now, it's important to think about some of the technical issues that you may face.

00:14.568 --> 00:18.865
For example, you'll want to frame your shots nicely so that you look good.

00:19.159 --> 00:20.731
You want to make sure that you're heard,...

00:20.877 --> 00:23.367
...so your sound is working or whatever device you're recording on.

00:23.529 --> 00:27.527
And think about lighting as well because obviously, it's your talent that counts,...

00:27.791 --> 00:31.360
...but we want to give it the best possible opportunity to shine.

00:31.685 --> 00:34.289
For example, at the moment, this is pretty good.

00:34.437 --> 00:36.821
But this, not so good.

00:37.530 --> 00:40.504
Also, a little bit scary; can we turn the light back on, please?
