00:01.944 --> 00:04.603
So, I asked my dad where he wanted to go for his 60th birthday.

00:06.637 --> 00:09.356
"Norway," he said, "the land of our ancestors."

00:12.977 --> 00:14.865
We drank a pint at Ibsen's favorite pub.

00:16.895 --> 00:18.385
We sampled the local fare.

00:21.301 --> 00:22.417
We saw the fjords.

00:24.890 --> 00:25.878
We got new sweaters.

00:27.536 --> 00:28.076
We bonded.

00:31.331 --> 00:33.125
It was the trip of a lifetime, dad said,...

00:37.033 --> 00:39.579
...until we went to the hall of records to trace our family tree...

00:41.454 --> 00:44.751
...and discovered we were actually Swedish.

00:46.423 --> 00:47.925
Two tickets to Stockholm please.

00:50.679 --> 00:53.236
From visiting old worlds to making new discoveries;...

00:53.536 --> 00:56.768
...whatever your story is, your Citi Card can help you write it.

00:57.674 --> 00:59.479
Citi: let's get it done.
