00:02.365 --> 00:03.303
Cheer up, Grumpy Cat!

00:03.365 --> 00:04.359
You're gonna be in a movie.

00:04.711 --> 00:06.055
Hey, I'm Jillian on Buzz60.

00:06.155 --> 00:09.591
For someone so cantankerous, Grumpy Cat is doing pretty well for herself.

00:10.127 --> 00:13.665
Grumpy Cat, who's real name is Tardar Sauce, will play herself in a movie...

00:13.730 --> 00:16.103
...where not unlike Garfield, she'll be able to talk.

00:16.338 --> 00:19.657
Deadline reports that Broken Road Productions is behind the feature film.

00:19.922 --> 00:23.120
You know, the guys who brought us the Zookeeper and Jack and Jill.

00:23.907 --> 00:25.761
Come on, it's a movie about a talking cat.

00:25.839 --> 00:28.799
I know she's super famous, but who are you expecting? Scorsese?

00:29.441 --> 00:31.629
But seriously, Grumpy Cat has a huge fanbase.

00:31.874 --> 00:35.777
20 million Youtube views, close to one million fans on Facebook,...

00:35.951 --> 00:37.875
...lots of TV appearances under her belt,...

00:38.083 --> 00:41.455
...and she was voted meme of the year at the 2013 Webby Awards.

00:41.669 --> 00:44.031
And this won't be her first time in a leading role.

00:44.171 --> 00:46.284
Grumpy cat is the face of Friskies Cat Food.

00:46.728 --> 00:49.659
Still, with all this success, Grumpy Cat is still as grouchy as ever.

00:49.949 --> 00:52.352
Well, I guess she learned from her celebrity doppelganger.

00:52.575 --> 00:54.123
That is just uncanny.

00:54.501 --> 00:56.349
Buzz60, now you know, pass it on.
