00:02.856 --> 00:10.055
For that little invisibility trick he does, Harry may have to ditch the cloak and go with fishnets.

00:11.069 --> 00:13.601
Scientists have created a new cloaking technique...

00:14.029 --> 00:17.910
...that not only can hide three-dimensional objects from microwave detection...

00:18.652 --> 00:24.724
...but is light, thin and flexible, traits lacking in previous attempts at invisibility.

00:25.638 --> 00:30.806
The new material called a Metascreen is constructed of strips of copper tape...

00:30.951 --> 00:34.711
...just 66 micrometers thick, the thickness of a human hair,...

00:35.289 --> 00:40.933
...attached to 100-micrometer-thick polycarbonate film in a fishnet design.

00:41.744 --> 00:46.590
When hit by microwaves, the new metamaterial scatters and cancels the waves,...

00:47.034 --> 00:49.143
...rendering anything the cloak is hiding,...

00:49.257 --> 00:54.285
...like an 18-centimeter cylinder in the test case, invisible from all angles.

00:55.218 --> 01:02.161
Dubbed "mantle cloaking" by its creators, this furtive fishnet would be easy to manufacture...

01:02.458 --> 01:06.699
...and could, in principle, be scaled to cloak objects from light.

01:07.818 --> 01:08.932
But with a caveat.

01:09.629 --> 01:13.727
Mantle cloaking scales inversely to the operational wavelength.

01:14.357 --> 01:20.755
So Harry, already a pretty small dude, would need to be a micrometer in size.
