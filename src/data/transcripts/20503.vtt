It's been said that the best songs don't give answers but instead ask questions.

00:14.049 --> 00:15.921
So, why?

00:17.144 --> 00:19.145
Why can a song change the world?

00:21.077 --> 00:22.784
Because music is a force.

00:24.010 --> 00:24.405
For good.

00:25.389 --> 00:26.072
For change.

00:27.052 --> 00:27.593
For whatever.

00:29.522 --> 00:30.429
It's bigger than us.

00:31.387 --> 00:32.764
It lives inside us.

00:33.930 --> 00:36.923
Because we were all conceived to a 4/4 beat.

00:38.781 --> 00:42.091
Because music can't be stopped, can't be contained.

00:43.435 --> 00:44.363
It's never finished.

00:46.216 --> 00:50.573
Because music makes us scream "Coo coo ca choo" and mean it.

00:52.755 --> 00:55.793
Because music is worth fighting for.

00:57.093 --> 00:57.400
Why?

00:58.811 --> 00:59.645
Because it's music.
