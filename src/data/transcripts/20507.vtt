A scientist from the University of Nottingham has discovered a new human body part.

00:07.590 --> 00:11.775
The layer of the cornea in a human eyeball that science was previously unaware of...

00:11.870 --> 00:14.041
...is only 15 microns thick.

00:14.737 --> 00:19.149
That thin layer of the cornea has been named Dua's layer, after Harminder Dua,...

00:19.311 --> 00:22.829
...a professor of ophthalmology and visual scientist who discovered it.

00:23.588 --> 00:26.506
Dua said, "This major discovery will mean that...

00:26.634 --> 00:29.618
...ophthalmology textbooks will literally need to be rewritten.

00:29.953 --> 00:32.658
There are many diseases that affect the back of the cornea...

00:32.819 --> 00:36.881
...which clinicians across the world are already beginning to relate to the presence,...

00:37.088 --> 00:39.017
...absence or tear in this layer."

00:39.827 --> 00:42.379
Researchers confirmed the existence of Dua's layer...

00:42.517 --> 00:45.064
...when they were doing a simulation corneal transplant.

00:45.366 --> 00:48.242
They injected bubbles into the cornea to separate the layers,...

00:48.369 --> 00:50.940
...and then put the layers under an electron microscope,...

00:51.137 --> 00:53.666
...which lets the scientists look at images magnified...

00:53.751 --> 00:56.036
...to thousands of times their actual size.

00:56.706 --> 00:59.215
The discovery will help scientists and doctors...

00:59.287 --> 01:02.417
...to better understand and treat different corneal diseases.
