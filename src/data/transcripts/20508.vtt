A major disease can be debilitating for anyone.

00:03.711 --> 00:08.050
However, optimism and tenacity can help overcome many associated challenges.

00:08.582 --> 00:13.357
Kristine Barnett's 15-year-old son named Jacob was diagnosed with a severe form of autism...

00:13.600 --> 00:14.482
...when he was just a toddler.

00:14.889 --> 00:19.564
The child had encountered lost speech and psychologists initially believed he would never talk again.

00:20.415 --> 00:22.829
The concerned mom placed Jacob in a developmental program...

00:23.050 --> 00:25.041
...which included meetings with numerous therapists.

00:25.371 --> 00:27.606
Although he was different from the other children his own age,...

00:27.872 --> 00:29.787
...Kristine noticed his high intelligence level.

00:30.486 --> 00:34.114
She took him on trips to a planetarium and sat outside, watching the stars with him,...

00:34.520 --> 00:36.758
...encouraging Jacob to take on hobbies and interests.

00:37.015 --> 00:39.394
And she also put a stop to the therapist meetings.

00:39.715 --> 00:43.377
She took on the role of teaching and educationally interacting with him on her own.

00:44.158 --> 00:47.760
Amazingly, by the age of three, Jacob began talking again.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.225
Six months later, he taught himself how to read.

00:50.866 --> 00:54.255
These days, the now teenage boy is working on obtaining a PhD.

00:54.922 --> 00:58.449
Kristine says, "If somebody had drive, they can accomplish anything."
