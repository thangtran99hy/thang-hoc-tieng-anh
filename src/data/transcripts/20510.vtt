00:08.888 --> 00:11.499
No one can say for certain where he came from.

00:12.833 --> 00:15.101
But they're certain he was born to clean.

00:17.454 --> 00:21.222
See, while most little boys always find ways to make messes,...

00:21.837 --> 00:23.551
...he'd always find ways to get rid of them.

00:24.952 --> 00:26.210
He had plenty of friends,...

00:27.822 --> 00:29.529
...but a different idea of fun.

00:31.269 --> 00:33.962
As he grew older, his curiosity grew with him,...

00:35.448 --> 00:38.461
...so he left the home he loved to learn more.

00:40.727 --> 00:43.249
And when he learned everything he could in the classroom,...

00:45.164 --> 00:47.011
...his passion drove him further.

00:50.123 --> 00:51.958
Until the day finally came.

00:52.412 --> 00:54.493
He learned everything there was to learn...

00:55.321 --> 00:56.657
...about getting rid of grime.

00:59.372 --> 01:00.495
The amazing part?

01:01.191 --> 01:02.805
He wasn't doing it for himself.

01:03.713 --> 01:05.349
He was doing it to help others.

01:07.517 --> 01:11.444
No matter who they were, where they lived or how big the mess was.

01:12.087 --> 01:14.624
It's hard to say what might have been exaggerated over time.

01:15.129 --> 01:20.250
But one thing's for sure: when it comes to clean, there's only one mister.
