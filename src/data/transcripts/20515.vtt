00:05.374 --> 00:07.376
ï»¿Where does your journey end?

00:09.556 --> 00:13.309
You seek that which would bestow upon you the right to rule.

00:16.850 --> 00:21.309
"The quest to reclaim our homeland and slay a dragon."

00:37.574 --> 00:39.034
Do not think I won't kill you, dwarf.

00:41.412 --> 00:44.194
When did we allow evil to become stronger than us?

00:45.267 --> 00:46.369
It is not our fight.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.009
It is our fight.

00:51.953 --> 00:53.383
What if it's a trap?

00:54.925 --> 00:57.244
It's undoubtedly a trap.

01:02.351 --> 01:04.610
Such is the nature of evil.

01:06.023 --> 01:09.196
In time all foul things come forth.

01:14.669 --> 01:19.035
If you awaken that beast, you will destroy us all.

01:31.107 --> 01:32.405
Was that an earthquake?

01:32.666 --> 01:38.096
That, my lad, was a dragon.
