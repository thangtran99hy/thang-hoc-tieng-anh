Hi Susan, mind if I join you?

00:03.631 --> 00:04.213
No.

00:05.504 --> 00:06.259
Do I know you?

00:06.511 --> 00:08.094
I'm Brian, IT Brian.

00:08.328 --> 00:10.610
Oh right, IT Brian.

00:14.932 --> 00:19.989
Many times, I've been wanting to ask you out for a long time now.

00:20.621 --> 00:24.531
Rebecca in HR gave me your number, and I don't think you have mine.

00:24.649 --> 00:25.456
Now you do.

00:27.317 --> 00:28.505
You love me?

00:30.589 --> 00:32.009
This is making me very uncomfortable.

00:32.100 --> 00:32.954
I'm sorry.

00:34.757 --> 00:35.651
I'm sorry.

00:39.652 --> 00:41.801
Keep the night of the 13th open.

00:42.234 --> 00:42.808
Why?

00:43.126 --> 00:44.051
For our parents to meet.

00:45.475 --> 00:46.863
We'll show them our new apartment.

00:47.799 --> 00:48.557
Here's your key.
