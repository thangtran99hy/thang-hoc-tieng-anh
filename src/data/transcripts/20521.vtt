ï»¿When words just aren't enough,...

00:08.300 --> 00:10.275
...say it with bacon.

00:18.069 --> 00:20.705
Fall in love with the original strip.

00:21.719 --> 00:22.053
Bacon.

00:23.562 --> 00:25.213
Is there any meat more noble?

00:28.049 --> 00:28.610
There isn't.

00:31.055 --> 00:38.049
What is superior flavor but the marriage of perfection and how something tastes.

00:40.289 --> 00:42.408
I always challenge my team to cut smarter...

00:43.221 --> 00:50.425
...because every strip of bacon has its own unique symmetry, like a snowflake.

00:51.605 --> 00:55.861
The bacon, it will tell you how it wants to be cut.

00:56.626 --> 00:59.722
All you have to do is listen and the bacon will show you the way.

01:01.865 --> 01:05.427
Nature, she provides the bacon strip,...

01:07.217 --> 01:08.750
...but our cure perfects it.

01:09.573 --> 01:12.719
Because while liquid smoke says, "I'm not that into you,"...

01:13.637 --> 01:20.341
...real, hardwood smoke says, "Take me to the symphony."

01:21.641 --> 01:25.090
Cut, color, cure, consistency.

01:25.537 --> 01:29.050
These are the four facets of the Oscar Mayer Original Strip.

01:30.398 --> 01:35.433
When it's time for the ultimate expression of love, say it on a plate.

01:36.102 --> 01:39.439
Give a gift from the Oscar Mayer Original Collection.
