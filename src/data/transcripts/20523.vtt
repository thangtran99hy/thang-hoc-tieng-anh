Online dating can be tough, but if you're not meeting anyone,...

00:04.983 --> 00:06.891
...maybe you're just not looking in the right places.

00:07.202 --> 00:08.487
Hey, I'm Gillian on Buzz60.

00:08.769 --> 00:13.709
The Internet is filled with dating websites, but in the midst of the eHarmonies and Match.coms,...

00:13.920 --> 00:17.022
...there are some really specific sites I bet you didn't even know existed...

00:17.660 --> 00:22.214
...like dating sites for farmers: Cowboy Cowgirl is "Where country meets country",...

00:22.512 --> 00:26.122
...and Farmers Only boasts thousands of down-to-earth country folks.

00:26.549 --> 00:27.347
Love to sail?

00:27.478 --> 00:28.739
Try Sea Captain Date.

00:29.075 --> 00:32.053
Or if you're a big fan of horses, check out Equestrian Cupid.

00:32.327 --> 00:35.232
Sometimes it's hard to find someone who can understand your restricted diet,...

00:35.549 --> 00:39.897
...but sites like Singles with Food Allergies and the Vegan Dating Service have you covered.

00:40.189 --> 00:45.581
If you care a lot about looks, ditch the Beautiful People only sites and give Find Your FaceMate a shot.

00:45.904 --> 00:48.262
It makes matches based on similar facial features.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.547
And there is Stache Passions for all the mustache lovers out there.

00:51.769 --> 00:56.725
Or you can try the UglyBugBall.com, dating for the aesthetically average.

00:56.878 --> 01:00.391
So maybe it should be called DatingForTheAestheticallyAverage.com

01:00.659 --> 01:01.151
Just a thought.

01:01.518 --> 01:02.001
Buzz60.

01:02.080 --> 01:03.290
Now you know, pass it on.
