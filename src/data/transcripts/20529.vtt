Last year, UK charity donations fell by 1.7 billion over previous years.

00:10.839 --> 00:16.289
And with charity collection boxes disappearing, there's even fewer opportunities for people to give.

00:16.701 --> 00:18.815
Pennies offers a new source of funding.

00:19.182 --> 00:23.117
It takes the old-fashioned habit of dropping a few coins in the charity box...

00:23.497 --> 00:28.233
...and brings it up-to-date to reflect the fact we're all shopping using debit and credit card.

00:28.523 --> 00:30.082
I think Pennies is absolutely fantastic.

00:30.191 --> 00:31.164
I'm always using my card.

00:31.250 --> 00:32.500
I never carry any cash with me.

00:32.869 --> 00:34.568
Now that we've proven it in a store,...

00:34.797 --> 00:38.887
...we really want to focus on taking it into the mobile and the online channels,...

00:39.363 --> 00:41.349
...the fastest-growing aspects of a retailer.

00:41.870 --> 00:43.851
I'd definitely donate pennies again this way.

00:44.096 --> 00:47.227
With the Global Impact Award, over the next three years...

00:47.490 --> 00:50.790
...we'd like to bring Pennies to the mobile and Internet channel,...

00:51.013 --> 00:54.292
...raising seven million pounds for many UK charities.

00:54.621 --> 00:59.165
Our vision: whether you'll be shopping in a store, online, using your mobile device,...

00:59.320 --> 01:02.165
...you should be given the option to donate a few pennies to charity.
