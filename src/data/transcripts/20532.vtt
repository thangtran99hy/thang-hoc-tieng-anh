ï»¿Impressions on the costume?

00:02.337 --> 00:02.631
I love it.

00:03.198 --> 00:07.635
I think it's a really good modernization of something very classic.

00:09.720 --> 00:12.173
It's got a very alien feel to it...

00:12.369 --> 00:16.717
...while being recognizable as the suit that we know and love.

00:19.358 --> 00:25.545
I think it brings a sort of, almost like a testosterone energy to something,...

00:26.415 --> 00:31.136
...which I think is required in today's movie world...

00:31.302 --> 00:41.249
...because everyone is so used to things being so high-octane and visceral in the news.

00:41.825 --> 00:45.953
Movies are fantasies that have to be even bigger and better...

00:46.072 --> 00:50.097
...and I think the suit lends something of that to this.

00:50.229 --> 00:55.790
It's something which is exceptionally cool and otherworldly at the same time.
