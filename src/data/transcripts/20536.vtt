00:09.784 --> 00:14.248
One of the best ways to get around Dublin is to ride on this double-decker, the hop-on hop-off.

00:14.352 --> 00:14.611
Let's go.

00:14.912 --> 00:16.215
You've arrived at Dublin City, folks.

00:16.312 --> 00:16.689
Welcome aboard.

00:20.580 --> 00:22.165
Okay, I've just gotten off the bus.

00:22.258 --> 00:23.769
I'm here on Grafton Street.

00:23.842 --> 00:26.893
There are shops everywhere, live music on every block.

00:27.236 --> 00:27.907
It's a lot of fun.

00:28.304 --> 00:29.513
You're pretty tall for a leprechaun.

00:29.579 --> 00:30.468
I thought you're supposed to be short.

00:30.674 --> 00:33.865
Probably Ireland's first great rock superstar.

00:42.889 --> 00:44.207
Alright, here we go, getting off the bus,...

00:44.516 --> 00:45.690
...seeing some other exciting spots.

00:47.101 --> 00:48.450
Okay, we're at St. Stephen's Green.

00:48.557 --> 00:51.003
We're right here in the very epicenter of the park.

00:51.298 --> 00:53.140
Just behind us here is the ornamental duck pond.

00:53.491 --> 00:57.532
It's very popular in the summer months with Spanish students feeding the ducks in the pond.

01:13.939 --> 01:16.829
I'm here in Ireland at the Guinness factory.

01:17.401 --> 01:18.091
Time to try it out.

01:19.023 --> 01:20.120
Guinness!

01:21.613 --> 01:26.004
I'm at Trinity College which is one of the best universities in the entire world.

01:26.358 --> 01:28.934
And it's also home to the Book of Kells.

01:30.381 --> 01:31.458
Wow, what a fun day!

01:31.588 --> 01:33.995
But you know all this bus riding is making me tired.

01:34.074 --> 01:36.225
I think it's time, time to find a pub.
