Hi there, I'm Jennifer Murphy and welcome to "Let's Move It."

00:09.419 --> 00:12.005
I'm here with Dr. Michael Roizen from Cleveland Clinic.

00:12.075 --> 00:12.643
Hey, Doctor.

00:12.763 --> 00:14.018
And you're moving it every day?

00:14.128 --> 00:15.783
You're gonna run a marathon, is that right?

00:15.854 --> 00:16.659
This is true.

00:16.735 --> 00:20.583
I am moving it every day, but the problem is Christian from Beachwood is not.

00:20.691 --> 00:22.271
He sits at his desk every day...

00:22.349 --> 00:25.279
...and he wants to know what can he do to burn some calories while at work.

00:25.713 --> 00:27.333
One, Christian, don't fall asleep.

00:27.720 --> 00:32.045
Your brain uses about 25% of your energy but you have to be awake.

00:32.153 --> 00:34.445
It really decreases when you fall asleep.

00:34.836 --> 00:38.056
We caught you at your desk the other day, so stay awake.

00:38.233 --> 00:40.685
Second thing is do walking meetings.

00:40.757 --> 00:44.051
If you ever have a meeting, don't do it at a desk or a table.

00:44.202 --> 00:45.144
Walk around.

00:45.577 --> 00:49.541
Third is go to the farthest bathroom every time you have to get up.

00:49.813 --> 00:51.172
Don't use the nearby one.

00:51.535 --> 00:53.831
Pass that by, go to the farther bathroom. 

00:54.151 --> 00:58.860
Anything you can do to move, but especially stay awake, is great.
