Hi, I'm Dr. Clark.

00:04.179 --> 00:06.497
You know that great mood you get from your daily workout?

00:06.863 --> 00:10.366
Here's an easy way to ratchet up those feel-good feelings a notch or two.

00:10.524 --> 00:11.331
Invite a friend.

00:11.683 --> 00:16.073
One study suggests that exercising with a fitness-minded buddy is more fun...

00:16.189 --> 00:21.241
...and boosts the level of happy chemicals, endorphins, your body produces when you exercise.

00:21.411 --> 00:25.505
Research has shown for years that exercise helps improve people's mood...

00:25.671 --> 00:28.334
...because it boosts the level of endorphins in your body.

00:28.617 --> 00:31.701
This study, which focused on university crew team members,...

00:31.944 --> 00:37.051
...showed that 45-minute workouts done in groups helped increase the rowers' pain threshold...

00:37.334 --> 00:39.963
...and their endorphin levels better than when they exercised alone.

00:40.279 --> 00:43.128
But you don't have to join a team to benefit from the buddy system.

00:43.545 --> 00:45.773
Just invite a friend to join you on a walk or a run.

00:46.221 --> 00:48.735
Or schedule a date with a pal to do a circuit at the gym.

00:49.057 --> 00:50.336
You'll both feel better for it.

00:50.637 --> 00:54.606
