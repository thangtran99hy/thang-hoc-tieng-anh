Hi, I'm Dr. Clark with a Smart Tip to burn more calories.

00:05.859 --> 00:09.217
When it comes to burning the most calories, which is the best, walking or running?

00:09.440 --> 00:11.670
Running generally burns more calories than walking.

00:11.932 --> 00:16.073
That's because when you run, your body recruits more muscles, which requires more energy.

00:16.217 --> 00:19.598
And the higher the intensity of your activity, the higher your heart rate rises.

00:19.706 --> 00:22.959
You'll also need more energy to keep up that activity during your workout.

00:23.119 --> 00:26.569
But if you run consistently, your body adapts to the stress put on it.

00:26.867 --> 00:31.535
And over time, running at the same intensity level for the same distance or duration,...

00:31.611 --> 00:35.672
...allows your body to keep up that level of activity while burning fewer calories.

00:36.104 --> 00:37.569
You might feel like you've plateaued.

00:37.868 --> 00:41.653
The solution is to shake up your program and keep it from becoming a routine.

00:41.809 --> 00:45.043
The more you challenge your body, the more calories your body will burn.

00:45.161 --> 00:48.444
Whether you walk, run or participate in another activity,...

00:48.751 --> 00:54.570
...rotate low, medium and high intensity workouts every week to help your body burn the most calories.

00:55.046 --> 00:58.495
