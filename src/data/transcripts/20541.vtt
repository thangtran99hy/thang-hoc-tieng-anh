I have an autistic son named Gavin.

00:03.606 --> 00:04.517
He's 16.

00:05.301 --> 00:08.872
Video gaming for him has been very positive.

00:10.847 --> 00:15.439
He loves Xbox and it has helped him with processing.

00:15.719 --> 00:17.632
It's helped him with language.

00:17.725 --> 00:20.001
It's helped him with numbers.

00:20.423 --> 00:22.437
It's helped him in so many ways.

00:22.619 --> 00:25.659
And he just got this game and he's navigating it pretty well.

00:25.743 --> 00:26.307
He's pretty good.

00:26.385 --> 00:28.779
He has taught himself French and Spanish...

00:28.880 --> 00:33.249
...and there's a big difference between him just watching a TV show or a movie...

00:33.476 --> 00:36.028
...and actually playing a game because his mind is engaged.

00:36.109 --> 00:37.665
He's using problem-solving skills.

00:37.755 --> 00:39.519
He's trying to figure out how to get past this wall.

00:40.317 --> 00:41.285
There you go, you did it!

00:41.909 --> 00:46.041
I think the moment that I discovered Gavin really took to video gaming...

00:46.142 --> 00:48.937
...was when I could see how he could problem-solve without me.

00:49.405 --> 00:54.442
I didn't realize just how smart or how deep his intellect was...

00:54.609 --> 00:56.321
...until he started video gaming.

00:57.855 --> 01:01.898
My name is Nori Fox and "kilaM0Mjaro" is my gamer tag.
