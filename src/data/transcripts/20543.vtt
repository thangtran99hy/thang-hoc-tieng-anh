On December 17, 1903, the Wright Brothers became the first in flight.

00:08.839 --> 00:10.914
I refused to give up the seat.

00:11.001 --> 00:11.931
I said, "No."

00:13.852 --> 00:18.560
I think the most amazing thing is how like us these chimpanzees are.

00:18.902 --> 00:19.917
Remember Lucy.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.245
All right, all right.

00:24.959 --> 00:25.757
Can you hear me?

00:26.676 --> 00:27.823
Can you hear your voice?

00:28.705 --> 00:29.777
That's exciting!

00:29.966 --> 00:31.273
Right a little higher.

00:31.374 --> 00:34.230
We work as a team so blindness is not a barrier.

00:37.699 --> 00:40.297
Touchdown confirmed; we're safe on Mars.

00:47.343 --> 00:48.299
Hi.
