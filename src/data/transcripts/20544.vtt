Gamers' Ground Zero, the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles...

00:05.094 --> 00:07.190
...and Sony and Microsoft go head-to-head.

00:07.421 --> 00:10.730
In an aggressive move, Sony has priced its new PlayStation 4...

00:10.926 --> 00:13.513
...substantially below its rival's Xbox One.

00:13.799 --> 00:18.199
The Japanese company also said that its console will run secondhand games...

00:18.335 --> 00:22.481
...and won't require an always on internet connection, unlike Microsoft's.

00:22.627 --> 00:24.212
Allowing Sony to crow,...

00:24.289 --> 00:27.259
PlayStation is synonymous with gaming, that's our DNA.

00:27.751 --> 00:31.577
We've always put the consumer first and obviously we're for-profit company,...

00:31.687 --> 00:32.882
...we're in business to make money,...

00:32.973 --> 00:36.884
...but if you make the consumers happy, the consumers will respond with loyalty.

00:37.546 --> 00:40.920
And I really think we focused on that consumer value...

00:41.008 --> 00:43.087
...from the first PlayStation that we ever put out there...

00:43.170 --> 00:44.877
...and we've never wavered from that.

00:44.975 --> 00:47.324
The markets reacted in a similar way to the gamers.

00:47.409 --> 00:50.141
Sony's shares rose, Microsoft's fell.

00:50.429 --> 00:52.364
Both companies are hoping their latest offerings...

00:52.460 --> 00:55.023
...will attract new fans and retain users...

00:55.093 --> 00:59.152
...who are increasingly playing games on smartphones and other mobile devices.

00:59.437 --> 01:04.550
Both will have their consoles in the shops before the year-end holidays.
