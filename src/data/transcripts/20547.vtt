Welcome to "English in a Minute."

00:06.885 --> 00:10.531
Do you find American idioms hard to understand?

00:11.162 --> 00:15.284
It's our goal to make learning them "a piece of cake."

00:16.090 --> 00:19.859
Everyone in America knows this idiom because it's so easy.

00:20.373 --> 00:20.603
Hey!

00:20.717 --> 00:21.978
How did you do on that exam?

00:22.197 --> 00:22.960
I got an A.

00:23.112 --> 00:24.470
The exam was a piece of cake.

00:25.655 --> 00:33.116
In American English, when you say something is a "piece of cake," it means it is very easy to do.

00:33.791 --> 00:40.489
In the 19th and early 20th century, African-Americans started "cakewalks."

00:41.216 --> 00:47.763
They walked or danced around a cake in pairs and the best couple won the cake.

00:48.591 --> 00:53.344
This is how the idioms "cakewalk" and "piece of cake" came about,...

00:53.988 --> 00:57.435
...both meaning that something is very easy to do.

00:58.232 --> 00:59.944
And that's "English in a Minute."
