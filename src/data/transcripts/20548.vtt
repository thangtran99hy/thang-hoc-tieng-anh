Welcome to "English in a Minute",...

00:07.353 --> 00:11.961
...where we teach you all about idioms in American English.

00:12.941 --> 00:15.572
You probably have heard someone say,...

00:16.683 --> 00:17.590
..."Break a leg."

00:18.291 --> 00:18.939
Don't worry.

00:19.292 --> 00:21.263
She isn't going to break someone's leg.

00:21.960 --> 00:25.085
This is an expression that means good luck!

00:25.529 --> 00:28.366
Let's listen to a conversation to find out.

00:29.699 --> 00:30.743
I'm so nervous.

00:30.852 --> 00:32.538
Tonight is the first night of the play.

00:32.947 --> 00:33.367
Is it?

00:34.003 --> 00:35.895
Well, go out there and break a leg!

00:36.871 --> 00:40.689
This phrase began as a way to wish actors good luck.

00:41.245 --> 00:47.177
Theater people said that if they wished each other something bad, good might happen.

00:47.715 --> 00:52.391
So when you hear "break a leg," it really means "do well."

00:53.211 --> 00:57.143
Also, it can mean to work really hard at something.

00:57.587 --> 00:59.830
And that's English in a Minute.
