Welcome to "English in a Minute",...

00:07.266 --> 00:11.809
...where we teach you all about idioms in American English.

00:12.511 --> 00:16.889
We have some phrases that sound a little painful, like this one:...

00:17.904 --> 00:19.265
...I am going to bite my tongue.

00:19.707 --> 00:22.819
This does not sound good, like it might hurt.

00:23.811 --> 00:24.579
Let's listen again.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.063
I couldn't believe that happened!

00:27.489 --> 00:27.985
I know.

00:28.085 --> 00:29.456
Are you going to say something?

00:29.565 --> 00:31.275
No, I am going to bite my tongue.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.891
I can't believe you are not going to say something.

00:34.221 --> 00:39.191
In American English, if I say that I'm going to bite my tongue,...

00:39.564 --> 00:42.559
...it means that I won't talk about something.

00:43.173 --> 00:44.865
I am going to keep quiet.

00:47.757 --> 00:51.576
This is an informal phrase, not one for business.

00:52.224 --> 00:53.570
I am going to bite my tongue.

00:57.639 --> 00:59.343
And that's "English in a Minute".
