Welcome to "English in a Minute",...

00:07.141 --> 00:11.963
...where we teach you all about idioms in American English.

00:12.273 --> 00:18.796
Imagine you are standing outside after a rainstorm and you take a deep breath.

00:21.691 --> 00:24.869
It's new, fresh and it smells good.

00:25.429 --> 00:28.565
But what does this have to do with American English?

00:29.041 --> 00:31.012
I love the new baseball coach.

00:31.221 --> 00:34.052
He's got great ideas for making us better players.

00:34.285 --> 00:34.805
He does.

00:34.975 --> 00:37.213
He's like a breath of fresh air for the team.

00:38.573 --> 00:41.261
A "breath of fresh air" means something new.

00:41.539 --> 00:44.587
It's a nice change from the way things used to be.

00:45.281 --> 00:50.310
You can use this phrase to describe an event, a place or even a person.

00:50.989 --> 00:54.377
And you can use this phrase in any situation.

00:57.665 --> 00:59.498
And that's "English in a Minute".
