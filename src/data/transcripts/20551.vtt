Welcome to "English in a Minute".

00:06.726 --> 00:14.024
America, the land of Hollywood, can sometimes be too concerned with things looking pretty.

00:14.553 --> 00:16.554
This is going to cost a pretty penny.

00:17.147 --> 00:19.872
Is she worried about making her money look good?

00:20.477 --> 00:23.675
Sometimes American English does not make any sense.

00:24.587 --> 00:25.675
Did you see that car?

00:26.124 --> 00:28.509
Oh my gosh! That car is awesome.

00:28.963 --> 00:31.118
Yes, I bet it is really fast.

00:31.421 --> 00:33.774
That car must have cost a pretty penny!

00:34.183 --> 00:39.241
Ah, it means that something costs a lot of money.

00:40.152 --> 00:46.083
Some say the phrase came from a special coin a British king had made long ago.

00:46.613 --> 00:52.948
American English is very descriptive, and sometimes we put a colorful word...

00:53.165 --> 00:56.847
...in front of a noun to get our meaning across.

00:57.213 --> 00:59.004
And that's "English in a Minute".
