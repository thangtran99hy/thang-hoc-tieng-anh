Welcome to English in a Minute.

00:06.814 --> 00:12.331
Usually, when people say "get out of here," it's because they want you to leave.

00:12.846 --> 00:16.463
But in American English, when you say it in a certain way,...

00:16.705 --> 00:19.376
...it can mean something completely different.

00:20.083 --> 00:22.963
I just moved to Washington, D.C. to start a new job.

00:23.498 --> 00:24.563
Where are you from originally?

00:24.981 --> 00:25.983
Dallas, Texas.

00:26.174 --> 00:27.263
Get out of here!

00:27.422 --> 00:29.246
I'm from Dallas, Texas, too!

00:30.145 --> 00:35.073
The phrase "get out of here" is a way to say something is very surprising,...

00:35.383 --> 00:38.185
...interesting or totally unexpected.

00:38.907 --> 00:43.021
If you say it in an angry tone, it's telling someone to go away.

00:43.738 --> 00:44.545
Get out of here!

00:44.659 --> 00:45.625
Get out of here!

00:45.707 --> 00:49.446
But if you say it in an excited tone with a happy face,...

00:49.612 --> 00:53.323
...it's a friendly way of saying you can't believe what you're hearing.

00:53.783 --> 00:54.522
Get out of here!

00:55.489 --> 00:56.750
Get out of here!

00:57.525 --> 00:59.114
And that's English in a Minute.
