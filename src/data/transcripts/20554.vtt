Welcome to "English in a Minute", where we teach you all about idioms in American English.

00:11.842 --> 00:14.818
Have you ever heard the American English idiom...

00:15.609 --> 00:16.689
..."Once in a blue moon".

00:17.324 --> 00:19.243
It doesn't mean that the moon is blue.

00:19.703 --> 00:25.133
So, let's listen to this American English conversation to find out how it is used.

00:25.535 --> 00:27.189
Where did you say your brother lives?

00:27.601 --> 00:30.869
He lives all the way in Minnesota so I never get to see him.

00:31.188 --> 00:33.064
I only get to see him once in a blue moon.

00:33.525 --> 00:38.563
"Once in a blue moon" is a common way of saying that something does not happen often.

00:38.953 --> 00:40.543
But what is a "blue moon"?

00:40.847 --> 00:44.057
We typically see a full moon once a month.

00:44.509 --> 00:48.277
And seeing two full moons in the same month is rare.

00:48.925 --> 00:53.619
The second full moon in a particular month is called the "blue moon".

00:54.413 --> 00:57.711
"Once in a blue moon" is an informal phrase.

00:57.979 --> 00:59.669
And that's "English in a Minute".
