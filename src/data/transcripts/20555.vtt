Welcome to English in a Minute.

00:07.015 --> 00:10.479
Have you ever heard this American English phrase?

00:10.819 --> 00:12.086
What's the game plan?

00:13.064 --> 00:16.224
This expression is very common in American English,...

00:16.561 --> 00:20.069
...but it does not have anything to do with playing a game.

00:20.352 --> 00:22.821
It's a way to ask for information.

00:24.040 --> 00:25.549
So, what's the game plan?

00:25.691 --> 00:26.824
What are we doing tonight?

00:27.507 --> 00:28.551
We're not sure yet.

00:28.765 --> 00:29.669
What do you want to do?

00:30.152 --> 00:32.363
When you say, "What's the game plan?",...

00:32.614 --> 00:36.175
...it's another way to ask someone for the details of a plan.

00:36.619 --> 00:39.214
It's the strategy for accomplishing something.

00:41.096 --> 00:46.368
In sports, a game plan is a set of instructions for the players to follow...

00:46.494 --> 00:48.266
...so they can win the game.

00:48.783 --> 00:52.237
Outside of sports, it could be a plan for going to dinner,...

00:52.481 --> 00:55.230
...seeing a play, or even watching a game.

00:56.177 --> 00:57.977
And that's English in a Minute.
