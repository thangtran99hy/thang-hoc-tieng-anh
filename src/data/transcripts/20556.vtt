I just can't believe her.

00:02.451 --> 00:04.729
She said that I look sloppy and bad,...

00:05.010 --> 00:07.065
...and that my clothes don't fit well.

00:07.253 --> 00:10.978
She said that I look like I live in a garbage can.

00:11.129 --> 00:13.483
Well, if the shoe fits, wear it.

00:14.681 --> 00:18.329
If someone says to you, "If the shoe fits, wear it,"...

00:18.747 --> 00:23.305
...they're saying that if something applies to you, then you should accept it.

00:24.159 --> 00:26.357
It can be unkind to say.

00:26.717 --> 00:31.559
So you should use this phrase only with people you know very well.

00:34.014 --> 00:35.955
And that's "English in a Minute".
