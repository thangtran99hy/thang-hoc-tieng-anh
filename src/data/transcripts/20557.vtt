Welcome to "English in a Minute."

00:07.238 --> 00:11.817
If you have ever heard people saying goodbye in American English,...

00:12.011 --> 00:16.043
...you probably have heard this: "Make sure to stay in touch."

00:16.268 --> 00:21.287
People who don't see each other often like to find ways to "stay in touch."

00:21.685 --> 00:23.039
But what does that mean?

00:25.143 --> 00:27.342
It was great to see you at the class reunion.

00:27.443 --> 00:29.033
Now make sure to stay in touch.

00:29.319 --> 00:31.417
I want to talk to you before our next reunion.

00:31.713 --> 00:32.245
I will.

00:32.327 --> 00:34.577
I'll stay in touch and I'll call you sometime next week.

00:37.834 --> 00:42.968
"Staying in touch" or "keeping in touch" says that you want to communicate with someone.

00:43.198 --> 00:47.427
It means you want to keep in contact, maybe by phone or e-mail,...

00:47.631 --> 00:49.845
...even though you don't see that person often.

00:51.267 --> 00:52.834
Make sure to stay in touch.

00:55.602 --> 00:58.051
And that's "English in a Minute."
