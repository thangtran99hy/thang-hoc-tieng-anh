Welcome to "English in a Minute."

00:08.061 --> 00:13.467
In American English, when someone responds to you by saying, "In your dreams,"...

00:13.787 --> 00:16.863
...does he mean that you're actually dreaming?

00:19.187 --> 00:19.855
Guess what?

00:20.197 --> 00:22.516
This weekend, I caught a fish this big.

00:22.625 --> 00:23.560
No way.

00:23.825 --> 00:25.546
Yeah, it was huge!

00:25.720 --> 00:26.791
In your dreams!

00:26.917 --> 00:29.370
There's no way you caught a fish that big.

00:29.707 --> 00:36.673
"In your dreams" is a different way of saying "I don't believe you" or "There's no way that's true."

00:37.198 --> 00:41.773
It is a way to tell people that you think they are making up a story.

00:42.365 --> 00:47.043
And this phrase is used in a playful manner, usually with a smile.

00:49.055 --> 00:50.222
In your dreams!

00:50.822 --> 00:52.487
In your dreams!

00:53.207 --> 00:55.333
In your dreams!

00:56.803 --> 00:58.628
And that's "English in a Minute."
