Welcome to "English in a Minute" where we teach you all about idioms in American English.

00:12.057 --> 00:16.039
If you have ever heard American English before, you may have heard this:...

00:16.931 --> 00:17.905
..."Keep your chin up."

00:19.314 --> 00:20.169
What does this mean?

00:20.758 --> 00:23.976
Let's find out by listening to an American English conversation.

00:27.192 --> 00:28.358
I don't know if I can take any more.

00:28.932 --> 00:30.141
First, my car broke down.

00:30.483 --> 00:31.463
Then I was late for work.

00:31.836 --> 00:33.738
And now my boss is mad at me for being late.

00:34.637 --> 00:36.198
You'll have a better day tomorrow.

00:36.432 --> 00:37.389
Just keep your chin up.

00:40.105 --> 00:45.751
"Keep your chin up" means to keep your spirits high and remain cheerful in a difficult situation.

00:47.822 --> 00:48.533
"Keep your chin up."

00:50.841 --> 00:55.211
This is an informal expression that can be used in any situation...

00:55.476 --> 00:57.703
...and everybody in America will understand you.

00:57.971 --> 00:59.487
And that's "English in a Minute."
