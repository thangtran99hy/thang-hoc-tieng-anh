Welcome to "English in a Minute",...

00:06.769 --> 00:11.035
...where we teach you all about idioms in American English.

00:11.835 --> 00:15.084
If I told you it was "raining cats and dogs" today,...

00:15.446 --> 00:18.802
...I don't think you would see this little kitten falling from the sky.

00:19.825 --> 00:21.639
But what would you see?

00:22.363 --> 00:23.665
Let's watch and find out.

00:26.919 --> 00:29.051
The rain is coming down so hard!

00:29.187 --> 00:31.649
I know, it's raining cats and dogs today!

00:34.311 --> 00:37.527
This is a very common expression in American English.

00:38.091 --> 00:42.025
When you say that it's "raining cats and dogs" in a conversation,...

00:42.414 --> 00:47.095
...it's another way to say that it's raining very hard or it's raining a lot.

00:47.788 --> 00:52.371
You can use this expression anytime and everybody will understand you.

00:52.899 --> 00:55.385
So, until the next time, stay dry!

00:56.990 --> 00:58.630
And that's English in a Minute.
