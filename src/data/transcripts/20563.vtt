Welcome to "English in a Minute",...

00:06.099 --> 00:10.475
...where we teach you all about idioms in American English.

00:11.030 --> 00:15.138
Sometimes, American English doesn't seem to make sense.

00:15.469 --> 00:16.277
Like this.

00:16.586 --> 00:18.945
Gloria has a lot of things going on in her life right now.

00:19.356 --> 00:20.509
Yes, she does.

00:20.641 --> 00:21.619
Her parents are sick.

00:21.693 --> 00:23.237
Her car is not working.

00:23.331 --> 00:26.876
She's building a new house and she just got a new job.

00:27.011 --> 00:28.756
Wow! That's a lot of stress.

00:29.087 --> 00:31.448
One more thing and she's going to be a basket case!

00:32.179 --> 00:35.921
Will Gloria really become a container for baskets?

00:36.497 --> 00:37.315
I don't think so.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.680
If you experience a lot of stress or try to handle too many things at the same time,...

00:44.105 --> 00:46.321
...your life might become very difficult.

00:46.759 --> 00:50.567
The nervous strain or tension might wear you out...

00:50.858 --> 00:53.302
...and leave you with a sense of hopelessness.

00:53.605 --> 00:55.629
That's what a basket case means.

00:56.683 --> 00:58.610
And that's "English in a Minute".
