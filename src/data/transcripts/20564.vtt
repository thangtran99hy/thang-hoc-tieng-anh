ï»¿Welcome to English in a Minute,...

00:06.733 --> 00:11.120
...where we teach you all about idioms in American English.

00:11.709 --> 00:15.204
There are times when something occurs and you might say,...

00:15.704 --> 00:17.995
..."This left a bad taste in my mouth."

00:18.343 --> 00:20.145
What does this phrase mean?

00:20.595 --> 00:22.735
A bad taste in my mouth.

00:23.259 --> 00:24.661
Hey, how was your vacation?

00:25.051 --> 00:25.931
It was great.

00:26.124 --> 00:29.155
But we had all of the money stolen from our hotel room.

00:29.625 --> 00:31.129
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

00:31.945 --> 00:35.613
I know, the whole thing left a really bad taste in my mouth.

00:35.961 --> 00:38.653
If something leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth,...

00:39.048 --> 00:41.969
...you feel there is something wrong about the situation.

00:42.575 --> 00:45.379
It gives you an unpleasant feeling or memory.

00:45.892 --> 00:51.188
Of course, you also can eat something that literally leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

00:51.573 --> 00:56.159
Either way, if something leaves a bad taste in your mouth, it isn't good.

00:57.173 --> 00:59.026
And that's English in a Minute.
