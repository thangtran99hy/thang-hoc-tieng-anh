Welcome to "English in a Minute" where we teach you all about idioms in American English.

00:11.827 --> 00:15.167
Idioms in American English can be hard to understand.

00:15.725 --> 00:19.518
So let's see if we can figure out what this idiom means.

00:22.733 --> 00:23.800
"Miss the point."

00:24.647 --> 00:26.589
Okay, so now do you understand?

00:27.523 --> 00:28.343
I'm not sure.

00:28.797 --> 00:29.842
Can you explain it again?

00:30.405 --> 00:31.846
I think I missed the point.

00:32.285 --> 00:34.405
Okay, I'll explain it one more time.

00:37.499 --> 00:44.485
It sounds like someone does not understand something and that's exactly what "miss the point" means.

00:44.903 --> 00:48.723
When you miss the point, it means that you don't understand something.

00:49.391 --> 00:54.191
You can use this phrase in any situation and everybody in America will understand you.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.128
"Miss the point."

00:56.740 --> 00:58.468
And that's "English in a Minute."
