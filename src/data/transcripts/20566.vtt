ï»¿Welcome to English in a Minute,...

00:06.843 --> 00:11.015
...where we teach you all about idioms in American English.

00:11.529 --> 00:14.531
What do you think this means?

00:15.498 --> 00:16.188
Let's listen.

00:16.819 --> 00:17.791
Keep my fingers crossed.

00:20.383 --> 00:21.309
Hey, how are you?

00:21.404 --> 00:22.431
Hey, I'm doing great.

00:22.930 --> 00:25.698
Actually, I just had a great job interview the other day.

00:26.197 --> 00:27.319
I really hope they hire me.

00:27.487 --> 00:29.059
Oh, have you heard back from them?

00:29.145 --> 00:31.380
No, not yet, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

00:31.831 --> 00:33.094
Hopefully, they'll call me today.

00:33.469 --> 00:38.441
They sound very hopeful, and that's exactly  what it means.

00:39.086 --> 00:42.644
In American English, keeping your fingers crossed...

00:42.907 --> 00:46.210
...means that you are hoping for the best possible outcome.

00:46.869 --> 00:50.721
This is a happy expression and you can use it in any situation,...

00:51.291 --> 00:55.304
...formal and informal, and everybody will understand what you mean.

00:56.928 --> 00:58.729
And that's English in a Minute.
