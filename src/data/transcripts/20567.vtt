Welcome to English in a Minute, where we teach you all about idioms in American English.

00:11.973 --> 00:13.846
Have you ever heard this before?

00:14.403 --> 00:16.787
I'm starving, let's grab a bite.

00:17.061 --> 00:21.523
If someone has ever told you in English that they were going to grab a bite,...

00:21.719 --> 00:25.630
...and you were confused, this is the right program for you.

00:29.273 --> 00:31.848
All this talk about food is making me hungry.

00:32.157 --> 00:34.389
Yeah, I'm starving too.

00:34.689 --> 00:35.730
Do you wanna grab a bite?

00:36.097 --> 00:36.895
Sounds good.

00:39.577 --> 00:43.309
In American English, when you say you want to grab a bite,...

00:43.645 --> 00:48.576
...it means that you want to eat right away, or that you're interested in eating quickly.

00:48.961 --> 00:53.867
If you want to make plans or sit down and have a nice, fancy meal at a restaurant,...

00:54.217 --> 00:56.322
...you may want to say something else instead.

00:56.725 --> 00:58.684
And that's English in a Minute.
