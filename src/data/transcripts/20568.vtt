What's up?

00:15.329 --> 00:16.033
What's up?

00:19.893 --> 00:22.216
Let's take a look at this conversation.

00:23.923 --> 00:24.835
Hey, what's up?

00:24.903 --> 00:25.232
What's up?

00:25.335 --> 00:26.068
How are you?

00:26.151 --> 00:27.389
I'm doing fine, thanks.

This phrase is a casual expression and is normally used when you're talking to friends,...

00:34.719 --> 00:36.220
...family, or colleagues.

00:36.733 --> 00:40.189
You would not want to use it in a formal business situation.

00:40.716 --> 00:42.202
"What's up?" is a greeting.

00:42.562 --> 00:44.825
It's a different way of saying "What's happening?".

00:45.311 --> 00:48.493
When you ask someone, "What's up?" in a conversation,...

00:48.763 --> 00:54.024
...it's another way to say hello, ask how things are going, how the person is feeling.

00:54.137 --> 00:57.747
It's a common greeting used by just about everybody in America.

00:58.219 --> 01:00.159
And that's English in a Minute.
