ï»¿Welcome to English in a Minute.

00:07.631 --> 00:12.959
Sometimes, American English is confusing and hard to understand, like:...

00:13.752 --> 00:15.063
...burn the midnight oil.

00:15.856 --> 00:18.659
Everybody knows Americans burn a lot of oil,...

00:19.202 --> 00:22.421
...but is there a special oil that they burn in the middle of the night?

00:23.350 --> 00:24.933
I have a big exam tomorrow.

00:26.019 --> 00:26.681
Are you prepared?

00:27.226 --> 00:28.313
No, not at all!

00:28.511 --> 00:30.243
I have to burn the midnight oil.

00:30.638 --> 00:32.214
I need to do well on this exam.

00:32.901 --> 00:37.034
Americans are not burning special oil reserved for the middle of the night.

00:37.493 --> 00:39.667
They are just staying up very late.

00:40.533 --> 00:44.097
This actually makes sense if you think of a candle or a lantern,...

00:44.501 --> 00:48.557
...and you have a lot of work to do that may take you all night.

00:49.419 --> 00:51.715
This is a phrase everybody will understand,...

00:52.357 --> 00:55.552
...and you can use this phrase when you have a lot of work to do...

00:55.725 --> 00:57.293
...and not that much time to do it in.

00:57.587 --> 00:59.486
And that's English in a Minute.
