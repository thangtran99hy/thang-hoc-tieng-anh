ï»¿Welcome to English in a Minute.

00:07.157 --> 00:12.699
If you have ever heard American English before, you had probably heard this phrase:...

00:13.006 --> 00:14.519
..."That's just my two cents."

00:15.893 --> 00:20.589
Does it make you wonder what pennies have to do with giving someone advice?

00:21.183 --> 00:22.511
Let's listen and find out.

00:24.434 --> 00:25.617
I love Nickelback.

00:26.030 --> 00:30.090
I think their music is really boring and everybody doesn't like them,...

00:30.223 --> 00:32.087
...but that's just my two cents.

00:33.161 --> 00:38.998
"My two cents" is a different way of saying "my opinion" or "my thoughts on the subject."

00:39.941 --> 00:41.829
Two cents isn't a lot of money.

00:42.313 --> 00:45.384
So saying something is "just my two cents worth,"...

00:45.966 --> 00:50.022
...is saying that your opinion might not be worth that much to someone else...

00:50.450 --> 00:53.774
In life, everyone will not always agree with you.

00:54.225 --> 00:56.660
So saying this lets people know that.

00:56.886 --> 00:59.490
And that's English in a Minute.
