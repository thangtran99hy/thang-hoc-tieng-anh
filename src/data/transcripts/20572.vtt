If you're speaking American English...

00:07.071 --> 00:11.525
...and you see an old friend or colleague you haven't seen in a while, you can say,...

00:11.741 --> 00:13.328
"It's been ages since we've talked."

00:14.081 --> 00:15.199
What does this mean?

00:15.576 --> 00:18.859
To find out, let's listen to an actual conversation.

00:19.696 --> 00:22.276
How are you? I haven't seen you for a few years!

00:22.369 --> 00:23.335
I'm doing great!

00:23.445 --> 00:25.523
It's been ages since we've talked, hasn't it?

00:25.899 --> 00:27.744
It's been a long time, that's for sure.

00:28.609 --> 00:33.993
In American English, "it's been ages" is another way of saying, "it's been a long time"...

00:34.217 --> 00:38.102
...or a long time has passed since you've seen each other.

00:38.692 --> 00:43.957
You may remember the word "ages" being used to talk about different periods of history,...

00:44.093 --> 00:47.933
...like the Ice Age or the Stone Age or the Bronze Age.

00:48.231 --> 00:51.817
Saying "it's been ages" uses exaggeration...

00:52.018 --> 00:57.153
...by saying that it's been many of those long stretches of time since something has happened.

00:57.598 --> 00:59.619
And that's English in a Minute.
