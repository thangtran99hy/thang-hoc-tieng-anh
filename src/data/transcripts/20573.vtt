Welcome to English in a Minute.

00:06.688 --> 00:09.803
Now, what would you think if you heard this?

00:10.224 --> 00:12.158
Actions speak louder than words.

00:12.312 --> 00:16.416
If you are just beginning to learn English, this might not make sense.

00:16.878 --> 00:20.277
Let's listen and see if we can find out what this phrase means.

00:20.829 --> 00:22.313
You keep saying that you'll help me.

00:22.753 --> 00:23.736
I'm going to help you.

00:23.925 --> 00:24.699
Really, I am.

00:24.959 --> 00:26.329
You just have to wait a little while.

00:26.835 --> 00:28.385
Well, we'll just wait and see.

00:28.679 --> 00:30.619
Actions speak louder than words.

00:31.515 --> 00:34.875
It sounds like she needs to see action instead of words.

00:35.037 --> 00:37.856
And that's exactly what this phrase means.

00:38.353 --> 00:44.400
'Actions speak louder than words' means what you do is more important than what you say.

00:44.757 --> 00:49.681
And if you say you are going to do something, then you need to do it.

00:50.015 --> 00:51.388
This is a casual phrase.

00:51.658 --> 00:53.492
But it does have a strong meaning,...

00:53.730 --> 00:57.973
...especially in American business, where results are important.

00:58.074 --> 00:59.912
And that's English in a Minute.
