If you have ever heard someone say that they were "dressed to kill",...

...don't worry, you're not in any danger.

00:07.343 --> 00:08.664
It's just the opposite.

00:10.183 --> 00:11.623
Do you see that couple over there?

00:12.067 --> 00:15.112
Yeah, it looks like they are going to that new restaurant.

00:15.271 --> 00:16.155
They look great!

00:16.548 --> 00:17.370
Oh, yeah!

00:17.579 --> 00:19.311
They are dressed to kill.

00:20.561 --> 00:24.599
In American English, "dressed to kill" is a different way of saying...

00:24.803 --> 00:29.371
..."dressed very attractively" or "dressed to impress".
