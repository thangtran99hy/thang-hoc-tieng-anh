Getting to know you has made me feel very protective of you,...

00:04.631 --> 00:10.276
...especially because I have two daughters who are about your age, college-aged kids.

00:11.091 --> 00:16.153
And it has also made me realize that you don't need protection...

00:16.250 --> 00:20.877
...because you're absolutely ready and prepared to take on the world.

00:23.529 --> 00:27.154
And if you have attended the Wurtele Center for Work and Life,...

00:27.421 --> 00:30.073
...you even have a "Passport to Life after Smith,"...

00:32.233 --> 00:36.223
...with the opportunity to learn things like job interviewing skills,...

00:36.476 --> 00:40.554
...how to balance a budget, cook a healthy meal, and even change a tire.

00:41.755 --> 00:47.633
So you can consider my speech today a continuation of the "Passport to Life after Smith,"...

00:48.092 --> 00:53.866
...though in the interest of full disclosure, I can't cook and definitely cannot change a tire.

00:56.129 --> 01:01.686
But part of life after Smith will be deciding what things do you want to put your energy into...

01:01.810 --> 01:03.355
...and what things you don't.

01:03.925 --> 01:05.920
It was a big revelation for me...

01:06.393 --> 01:10.677
...when I realized that I didn't have to complete everything I thought I wanted to do,...

01:10.797 --> 01:14.429
...like learning German or becoming a good skier or learning to cook.

01:15.005 --> 01:20.049
Indeed, I realized that you can complete a project by dropping it.

01:27.932 --> 01:32.509
Now, commencement speakers are traditionally expected to tell graduates...

01:32.792 --> 01:36.259
...how to get out there and climb the ladder of success.

01:37.147 --> 01:41.117
But I want to ask you instead to redefine success...

01:42.117 --> 01:45.951
...because the world you are headed into desperately needs it...

01:46.534 --> 01:48.323
...and because you are up to it.

01:49.207 --> 01:52.722
Your education at Smith has made it unequivocally clear...

01:53.322 --> 01:57.501
...that you are entitled to take your place in the world on equal footing...

01:57.605 --> 02:00.299
...in every field and at the top of every field.

02:01.293 --> 02:02.883
But what I urge you to do...

02:03.359 --> 02:08.616
...is not just to take your place at the top of the world, but to change the world.
