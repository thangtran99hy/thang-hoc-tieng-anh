So, you tap the video icon and all of a sudden, you'll go into video mode.

00:05.365 --> 00:07.692
Slide over, you've got a separate capture button.

00:08.169 --> 00:11.160
All you have to do is hold down the button to start recording the video.

00:11.240 --> 00:11.937
So let's do that.

00:12.672 --> 00:14.295
So, let's say we're at Blue Bottle Coffee.

00:14.665 --> 00:17.841
They're using a Japanese siphon machine that makes some really beautiful coffee.

00:17.931 --> 00:21.263
We're recording our first clip here of the barista at Blue Bottle.

00:22.667 --> 00:25.237
Now, we wanna add some color of pulling a shot of the espresso.

00:26.409 --> 00:27.507
This is making me thirsty.

00:28.173 --> 00:31.703
So, we see the next shot of pulling some espresso,...

00:32.799 --> 00:36.131
...and then finally, let's see the barista applying a beautiful latte.

00:36.863 --> 00:40.510
So, here we are pouring the beautiful latte and I'm recording it by holding down that button.

00:40.778 --> 00:43.708
All we gotta do is touch the little delete button on the bottom left.

00:43.809 --> 00:45.884
It highlights the last clip and deletes it.

00:46.377 --> 00:49.424
So, let's re-record that last one to get a better collage.

00:50.195 --> 00:52.855
My friends are gonna be way more excited about watching this video,...

00:53.067 --> 00:54.760
...if they get to see the really cool latte.

00:56.119 --> 00:58.309
So, when I click next, you'll see the preview.

00:59.091 --> 01:00.719
This is what people are gonna see in the feed.

01:01.372 --> 01:05.048
I can fill out my caption that I want my friends to see.

01:05.655 --> 01:07.609
Hashtags work just the same way.
