Hello! I'm Emmett.

00:30.024 --> 00:30.963
I'm just gonna come right out.

00:31.241 --> 00:33.723
I have no idea what's going on at all.

00:35.623 --> 00:40.555
My fellow master builders, including but not limited to, Superman, Wonder Woman,...

00:40.628 --> 00:43.773
...The Mermaid, Green Ninja, 1980-something space guy...

00:43.861 --> 00:44.031
Hello!

00:44.107 --> 00:48.486
...Michelangelo, Michelangelo, and the 2002 NBA All-Stars.

00:48.559 --> 00:53.239
We have learned that Lord Business plans to end the world as we know it.

00:54.019 --> 00:55.212
There is yet one hope.

00:55.495 --> 00:57.290
The Special has arisen.

00:59.216 --> 01:00.135
I think I got it.

01:00.638 --> 01:03.613
But just in case, tell me the whole thing again, I wasn't listening.

01:13.347 --> 01:15.489
I'm freaking out!

01:20.169 --> 01:21.467
Relax, everybody, I'm here.

01:21.569 --> 01:23.416
Batman? Awesome!

01:23.725 --> 01:25.159
Could you make one of these in orange?

01:25.395 --> 01:26.611
I only work in black.

01:26.937 --> 01:29.128
And sometimes very very dark gray.

01:39.951 --> 01:43.275
Hey, pal, I hate to tell you this, but I don't think you're supposed to be here.

01:43.762 --> 01:45.974
Well, I guess I'm gonna have to report....

02:00.887 --> 02:01.521
No, wait!

02:01.699 --> 02:02.048
Wait up!
