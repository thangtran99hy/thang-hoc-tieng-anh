Wanna see something scary?

00:03.625 --> 00:05.143
I mean, worse than scary, like, disgusting?

00:06.179 --> 00:06.534
Okay.

00:07.175 --> 00:09.447
This will turn your stomach but you asked for it.

00:10.059 --> 00:13.363
Prepare yourself for the worst advice in the history of the world.

00:14.955 --> 00:16.600
"Work smart, not hard."

00:17.283 --> 00:19.545
You've heard the expression back in the early 70s;...

00:19.621 --> 00:23.423
...when college needed a PR campaign, somebody put this on a poster,...

00:24.080 --> 00:26.680
...and you can see at a glance what they were suggesting.

00:27.300 --> 00:30.507
If you're not this guy, you might wind up like this guy.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.330
Today, skilled trades are in demand.

00:33.509 --> 00:35.477
In fact, there are 3 million jobs out there...

00:35.549 --> 00:38.004
...that companies in this country are having a hard time filling,...

00:38.065 --> 00:41.628
...so we thought the skilled trades could do with a PR campaign.

00:41.964 --> 00:44.781
So, we took the same idea and went ahead and vandalized it.

00:45.736 --> 00:47.783
"Work smart and hard."

00:48.981 --> 00:50.959
The rest, I believe, speaks for itself.

00:51.933 --> 00:53.025
And that's the lesson from the dirt.

00:54.149 --> 00:54.425
Thank you.
