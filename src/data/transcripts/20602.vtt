00:01.464 --> 00:03.800
ï»¿This was the best year of my life.

00:05.501 --> 00:10.405
Now, I can understand everything and I can say whatever I need to say.

00:13.887 --> 00:16.879
This is my fourth summer in a work and travel program.

00:18.271 --> 00:20.608
I met so many people here, so many friends.

00:20.703 --> 00:21.599
I like my job.

00:24.389 --> 00:25.200
It's totally worth it.

00:26.131 --> 00:27.131
We help each other.

00:27.563 --> 00:30.797
And I meet a lot of people from different countries.

00:35.679 --> 00:36.707
This is really different.

00:36.956 --> 00:37.578
I like it.

00:41.139 --> 00:42.138
I like this job.

00:42.449 --> 00:46.863
You know that you'll really make a difference, and you'll feel very honored to do this.

00:52.743 --> 00:55.816
When I got here, I was like, "Wow!"

00:57.819 --> 01:00.733
What it does for me is help me know what to do when I get in real life.

01:02.894 --> 01:05.829
My colleagues here are a ton of fun.

01:06.431 --> 01:07.889
Our domestic employees love it...

01:07.961 --> 01:10.797
...'cause they have the opportunity to make friends from all around the world.

01:11.257 --> 01:14.759
And the international students really get an opportunity to immerse themselves...

01:14.829 --> 01:16.409
...and learn about American culture.
