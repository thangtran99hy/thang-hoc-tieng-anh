After reviewing 20 years of research,...

00:07.702 --> 00:13.145
...a scientist from Bristol University has concluded that chickens are smarter than human toddlers.

00:13.913 --> 00:16.354
Skills including numeracy and self-control...

00:16.484 --> 00:18.621
...are among those in which chickens show mastery,...

00:19.017 --> 00:22.208
...whereas humans don't get the hang of them until about their fourth year.

00:22.873 --> 00:24.848
It's not just any chickens, by the way.

00:25.222 --> 00:28.471
Freshly hatched chicks show that they can track up to five numbers...

00:28.661 --> 00:32.309
...by consistently picking the group of plastic eggs with a larger number...

00:32.503 --> 00:34.663
...even after the egg groupings were moved around.

00:35.384 --> 00:39.166
In the review, it was also learned that not only do chickens excel at math,...

00:39.469 --> 00:42.182
...they show promise in the area of structural engineering.

00:42.887 --> 00:46.763
In other words, the test chicks were more interested in diagrams of objects...

00:46.833 --> 00:50.610
...that were structurally feasible rather than those that were physically impossible.

00:51.393 --> 00:56.633
Several of the studies also showed young chickens were capable of both empathy and showing self-control,...

00:56.869 --> 01:00.543
...two additional abilities not present in toddlers until around four.

01:01.285 --> 01:03.943
This isn't to say that chickens are any better than toddlers,...

01:04.195 --> 01:07.621
...just that it appears chicks are a lot more complex than most think.
