00:02.475 --> 00:07.633
The American Medical Association has decided to officially classify obesity as a disease.

00:08.403 --> 00:13.143
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over 1/3 of Americans are obese.

00:13.878 --> 00:19.405
Although obesity is associated with a variety of different health problems like diabetes or heart condition,...

00:19.645 --> 00:25.281
...until now it was not recognized as a disease, but rather a condition that caused other diseases.

00:26.009 --> 00:30.520
The AMA's decision might influence both health care professionals and insurance providers...

00:30.800 --> 00:32.615
...to start treating obesity in a different way,...

00:32.895 --> 00:35.503
...which includes reimbursements for treatment of the disease.

00:36.315 --> 00:40.833
One potential issue with the decision is that it will change the treatment from lifestyle choices...

00:41.100 --> 00:42.407
...to a more clinical approach.

00:43.124 --> 00:46.915
The AMA's decision addresses the myriad of issues surrounding obesity, saying,...

00:47.176 --> 00:52.505
..."There are hormonal and metabolical abnormalities not reversible by lifestyle interventions..."

00:52.900 --> 00:56.957
"...that will likely require multiple different risk stratified interventions for patients."
