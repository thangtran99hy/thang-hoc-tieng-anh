00:08.895 --> 00:10.390
ï»¿There was a time when I had it all.

00:11.117 --> 00:13.589
People would ask me, "What was it like being untouchable?"

00:17.593 --> 00:21.224
The question they really should have asked was, "What happens when it's all over?"

00:27.914 --> 00:31.016
You set a good example by snitching on your friends in the mob.

00:31.745 --> 00:32.780
We're not in Brooklyn anymore.

00:33.041 --> 00:35.267
I don't think there's anywhere further from Brooklyn than this rat hole.

00:36.075 --> 00:37.926
I'm sick of being in witness protection.

00:38.362 --> 00:39.334
Welcome to France.

00:39.471 --> 00:40.026
Try to fit in.

00:40.099 --> 00:42.469
I'm getting tired of finding you a new place to live every 90 days.

00:43.887 --> 00:45.200
So, do we still have the same names?

00:45.428 --> 00:46.735
No, we are the Blake family.

00:47.271 --> 00:48.097
Anything to report?

00:49.097 --> 00:49.650
Kids, school?

00:52.413 --> 00:53.636
They always adjust better than we do.

00:55.755 --> 00:56.501
You're a maniac.

00:57.376 --> 00:57.814
Thank you.

00:59.188 --> 01:01.569
Let's talk about the complaints I have received.

01:01.630 --> 01:02.251
Complaints?

01:02.472 --> 01:04.775
Corruption, theft, bribery.

01:05.850 --> 01:06.733
I want to see my lawyer.

01:10.679 --> 01:11.095
Peanut butter.

01:11.293 --> 01:12.865
On the right, after the dog food.

01:14.149 --> 01:15.319
Stupid American.

01:18.366 --> 01:18.911
How was your day?

01:21.599 --> 01:22.191
Fine.

01:24.547 --> 01:26.375
Who knows what'd happen to you and your family when they find you.

01:27.057 --> 01:28.609
You're here to make sure that don't happen, right?

01:30.639 --> 01:31.880
Try not to make my job impossible.

01:33.415 --> 01:33.952
They're there somewhere.

01:34.161 --> 01:34.468
Find them.

01:35.883 --> 01:37.980
It's a clean up operation, get that family out of there.

01:39.129 --> 01:41.765
I confess, it's been years since I went to confession.

01:42.806 --> 01:45.264
Your family's the incarnation of evil.

01:45.718 --> 01:47.121
What is all this grief about?

01:48.289 --> 01:48.933
Can I use your phone?

01:49.063 --> 01:49.980
You don't lend your phone to...

01:51.582 --> 01:52.655
I gotta find my kids.

01:55.704 --> 01:56.237
You're insane.

01:56.558 --> 01:56.810
I know.

02:09.403 --> 02:10.211
How was the first day?

02:10.674 --> 02:12.018
Nothing special.

02:17.303 --> 02:18.424
Why'd you kill the plumber?

02:18.658 --> 02:19.139
I didn't kill him.

02:20.175 --> 02:21.115
I took him to the hospital.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.463
Who's gonna fix the pipes now?

02:22.767 --> 02:25.633
Who's gonna rebuild the supermarket that burned down the day we got here?
