00:00.127 --> 00:03.081
This is a pomodoro.

00:03.949 --> 00:05.629
This is a pomodoro timer.

00:06.290 --> 00:08.435
This is the Pomodoro Technique.

00:09.197 --> 00:12.607
The Pomodoro Technique is a simple yet very effective way...

00:12.687 --> 00:15.096
...to improve your work and study habits.

00:16.381 --> 00:21.431
The basic requirement of this technique is to set a kitchen timer to 25 minutes.

00:23.542 --> 00:25.514
But this is just the beginning.

00:26.417 --> 00:29.126
In order to become a certified Pomodoro master,...

00:29.487 --> 00:32.266
...you need to achieve the following six objectives.

00:33.019 --> 00:36.611
First: Find out how much effort an activity requires you...

00:36.954 --> 00:39.289
...by monitoring how many pomodoros you need...

00:39.588 --> 00:42.201
...in order to accomplish a specific task.

00:43.775 --> 00:49.189
Second: Learn to protect your pomodoro from the internal and external interruptions.

00:50.282 --> 00:54.765
Third: Make accurate estimations of how many pomodoros you need...

00:54.967 --> 00:56.229
...for a certain activity.

00:57.499 --> 01:01.980
Fourth: Use your pomodoro time not just to work on your task,...

01:02.351 --> 01:06.139
...but spend a few minutes for recap and the last ones for review.

01:07.785 --> 01:15.106
Fifth: Set a timetable according to your to-dos, to your time or even to the season.

01:15.600 --> 01:20.028
This is good for organizing work and also for creating more free time.

01:21.272 --> 01:26.587
Sixth: Once you have completed these objectives, find your own personal objective,...

01:27.081 --> 01:31.163
...such as being more efficient or improving the quality of your work.

01:31.553 --> 01:34.402
For example, a writer could track more accurately...

01:34.557 --> 01:36.243
...what he's doing during a pomodoro.

01:36.897 --> 01:40.020
Or a team may want to find out how good its cooperation is.

01:40.600 --> 01:45.028
But remember, you have to choose your own final objective.

01:45.887 --> 01:50.143
In order to achieve the best results, the objective should be done incrementally.

01:50.651 --> 01:53.300
In other words, if you didn't complete an objective,...

01:53.707 --> 01:55.114
...don't move ahead to the next one.

01:55.575 --> 01:58.386
Continue trying to do better with the current objective...

01:58.862 --> 02:00.325
...until you feel that you've mastered it.

02:01.264 --> 02:04.095
For more in-depth tips, read the original book,...

02:04.529 --> 02:08.847
...record your progress and become a certified pomodoro master.
