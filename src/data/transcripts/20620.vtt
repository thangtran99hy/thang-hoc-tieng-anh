00:19.588 --> 00:22.287
Here we are at one of the country's most interesting zoos.

00:38.096 --> 00:40.860
Here we find the wolf in his natural setting.

00:42.615 --> 00:44.610
Next, a pack of camels.

00:47.641 --> 00:49.069
A North American greyhound.

00:54.317 --> 00:56.839
And here, two bucks.

00:58.030 --> 00:59.161
And five scents.

01:02.109 --> 01:04.471
And here, two friendly Elks.

01:04.845 --> 01:05.464
Hello, Bill.

01:05.739 --> 01:06.796
Hello, Bill.

01:06.961 --> 01:07.797
Hello, Bill.

01:08.008 --> 01:08.851
Hello, Bill.

01:09.278 --> 01:11.962
No zoo would be complete without a monkey cage.

01:55.206 --> 01:56.339
Hey sister!

01:56.718 --> 01:58.135
Can't you read?

02:05.054 --> 02:10.648
Mother Nature's own weatherman: the little groundhog and his shadow.

02:15.089 --> 02:16.573
Over here, we find...

02:21.034 --> 02:21.841
Hey son, hey!

02:22.147 --> 02:23.371
Hey, don't annoy that lion!

02:23.771 --> 02:24.557
It's dangerous.

02:25.130 --> 02:26.120
Can't you read that sign?

02:26.929 --> 02:28.931
You'd better take my advice and leave him alone.

02:29.271 --> 02:30.617
Shame, shame.

02:30.712 --> 02:32.140
You're a bad boy.

02:34.053 --> 02:38.013
The skunk cage is always a center of interest.

02:46.897 --> 02:48.376
Well, we're lucky.

02:48.986 --> 02:50.881
It's feeding time for the giraffe.

03:08.570 --> 03:09.268
Listen now, fella.

03:09.707 --> 03:12.092
This is the second time I've had to speak to you.

03:12.485 --> 03:13.517
Leave that lion alone.

03:13.595 --> 03:14.361
I'm warning you.

03:15.866 --> 03:18.182
I'm a bad boy.

03:21.009 --> 03:23.795
And here we come to a family of white rabbits.

03:24.681 --> 03:27.831
Of course, you all know how fast they multiply.

03:36.490 --> 03:40.897
Now over here in the bird house, we find the wise old owl.

03:41.375 --> 03:42.085
Who?

03:42.215 --> 03:42.532
You.

03:43.002 --> 03:43.837
Me?

03:44.299 --> 03:44.781
Yes.

03:49.245 --> 03:52.159
An interesting bird is the South African talking parrot.

03:53.177 --> 03:53.866
Polly want a cracker?

03:55.709 --> 03:57.538
I said, Polly want a cracker?

03:57.884 --> 04:00.395
Nah, give me a short beer.
