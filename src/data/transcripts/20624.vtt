00:05.037 --> 00:05.969
ï»¿Meet Jack.

00:08.291 --> 00:15.857
Tracking all of work and life's information has turned Jack into a note monster.

00:17.081 --> 00:19.153
Now meet Jack's friend, Jill.

00:19.894 --> 00:22.140
Jill is an awesomeness machine.

00:23.783 --> 00:27.587
Jill always seems to remember the slightest bit of data.

00:29.628 --> 00:31.885
Information doesn't control Jill.

00:32.483 --> 00:34.430
Jill controls information.

00:35.127 --> 00:40.269
Jill has so much extra time on her hands that she can nurture her secret love:...

00:40.773 --> 00:44.379
...collecting farm animals in origami.

00:46.763 --> 00:48.068
What's Jill's secret?

00:48.739 --> 00:51.855
Evernote: the superhuman maker.

00:54.275 --> 00:57.230
If only everyone could use Evernote.

01:01.453 --> 01:02.671
Idea, Jill?

01:05.050 --> 01:11.204
Evernote grabs your information from anywhere and transports it to the magical cloud of elephants.

01:16.591 --> 01:19.913
Whether text note, snapshot, web clip or audio,...

01:20.412 --> 01:26.550
...Evernote's tireless elephants automatically categorize and index your information,...

01:27.079 --> 01:32.073
...preparing it all for instant retrieval whenever and wherever you need it.

01:32.574 --> 01:37.812
Evernote transforms the common note monster into a superhuman.

01:42.147 --> 01:43.215
Idea, Jack?

01:47.539 --> 01:50.487
And so ends our story of Jack and Jill.

01:50.881 --> 01:55.166
Another happy ending, another note monster vanquished.

01:55.725 --> 01:57.559
All thanks to Evernote.

01:58.416 --> 01:59.215
Evernote.

01:59.572 --> 02:01.487
Remember everything.
