People change their e-mail addresses for lots of reasons.

00:03.203 --> 00:05.595
Some decide they need a more professional sounding address.

00:05.843 --> 00:08.840
Others change their name when they get married and want a new address to match.

00:09.225 --> 00:11.412
Others just want to switch e-mail services altogether.

00:11.881 --> 00:14.803
To change your e-mail address, first sign up for a new one.

00:15.757 --> 00:18.611
Fill out the online form, make sure everything is correct,...

00:18.739 --> 00:21.330
...and then click "I accept, create my account."

00:22.554 --> 00:26.874
Then, e-mail your contacts from this new account to let them know you changed addresses.

00:33.680 --> 00:38.328
Some Webmail services, including Gmail, let you forward mail from one account to another.

00:38.837 --> 00:43.199
To do this, sign in to your old account, visit the Forwarding section of Settings,...

00:43.493 --> 00:46.192
...and set up your old account to forward mail to your new one.

00:52.388 --> 00:54.894
That way, you won't miss anything as you make the switch.
