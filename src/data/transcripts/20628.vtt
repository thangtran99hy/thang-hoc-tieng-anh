Strong passwords help to prevent malicious people from accessing your information.

00:04.355 --> 00:08.309
A good password is hard for other people to guess, but easy for you to remember.

00:08.912 --> 00:12.958
Variations on words like "password" or "secret," dictionary words...

00:13.197 --> 00:16.738
...and patterns on the keyboard like QWERTY or 12345,...

00:16.973 --> 00:20.003
...generally don't make good passwords because they're too easy to guess.

00:20.342 --> 00:26.812
Using a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols makes your password harder to guess.

00:27.357 --> 00:30.876
Try starting with a random word or phrase like "I love sandwiches"...

00:31.109 --> 00:34.958
...and inserting symbols, letters and numbers to make your password more secure.

00:35.892 --> 00:38.225
But don't use that one because we have it in this video.

00:38.761 --> 00:43.144
Be sure to use unique passwords for your different accounts, like your e-mail and online bank account.

00:43.452 --> 00:45.159
And keep your password a secret, too.

00:45.523 --> 00:46.778
It's something only you should know.
