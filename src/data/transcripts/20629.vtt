I'm Jorgette Grosso and I'm from Boonton, New Jersey,...

00:05.701 --> 00:10.565
...and my major is a bachelor's in electronics and computer engineering technology.

00:11.461 --> 00:14.350
There is a big stereotype that women can't do math,...

00:14.464 --> 00:18.767
...or can't, you know, work with high-tech stuff.

00:19.775 --> 00:24.527
But I've taken the hardest level math course that this school offers,...

00:24.623 --> 00:27.185
...and I'm here to attest that that's not true.

00:28.311 --> 00:32.484
In this major, basically with the computers, we do a lot of digital programming.

00:33.037 --> 00:39.199
Without them we'll do basic circuitry design and actually building circuits.

00:43.748 --> 00:45.839
Yep, the number of pixels that it's seeing...

00:46.094 --> 00:48.668
...so that it will be able to judge how far away the object is.

00:49.039 --> 00:53.574
This major is definitely a mix between theory and lab:...

00:53.740 --> 00:56.595
...one hour of theory and three hours of lab.

00:57.057 --> 00:57.976
That's why I liked it.

00:58.062 --> 00:59.189
That's why I came here.

01:00.168 --> 01:03.151
I learn a lot better doing.

01:04.294 --> 01:07.219
My project is an autonomous color tracking robot.

01:07.665 --> 01:11.109
Autonomous meaning that it doesn't have a remote control.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.419
Nothing is controlling it except for itself.

01:13.732 --> 01:17.924
Color tracking basically will follow a specific color that you choose.

01:18.010 --> 01:19.303
...in this case I chose red.

01:19.884 --> 01:25.794
And then robot, it's just the thing that goes along with it; it's working on its own.
