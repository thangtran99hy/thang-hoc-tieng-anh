Today, I'm gonna show you how to fold a shirt in under two seconds.

00:08.076 --> 00:11.275
Start by taking a short-sleeved shirt and lying it out on its back.

00:11.893 --> 00:13.590
Then we need to draw an imaginary line...

00:13.719 --> 00:16.538
...halfway between the top and the bottom of the shirt, roughly here...

00:16.972 --> 00:19.384
...and another one a halfway between the centre line of the shirt...

00:19.449 --> 00:21.121
...and the outside edge, about here.

00:21.658 --> 00:26.401
We'll call the point where the lines cross A, the top point B, and the bottom point C.

00:27.585 --> 00:30.112
Start by pinching the shirt at point A with your left hand,...

00:30.382 --> 00:31.938
...pick up point B with your right hand,...

00:32.189 --> 00:34.455
...then cross your right hand over to pick up point C.

00:35.321 --> 00:40.681
Next, quickly unfold your arms and finally, use the table to fold the shirt back on itself.

00:40.869 --> 00:44.691
This method works with any short-sleeved top, from T-shirts, polo tops and shirts...

00:44.988 --> 00:47.157
...and with a bit of practice can be done very quickly.
