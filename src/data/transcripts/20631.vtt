00:02.437 --> 00:06.030
The search has begun for volunteers for a mission to fly to Mars.

00:06.330 --> 00:09.967
The only slight catch is that if you go, you can't come back.

00:10.329 --> 00:14.226
It's part of a plan by a not-for-profit Dutch company called Mars One...

00:14.517 --> 00:18.197
...who wants to establish a permanent human colony on the Red Planet.

00:18.564 --> 00:24.346
Today, the Mars One foundation starts to search for Mars inhabitants,...

00:25.768 --> 00:30.655
...the search for people from all nations who want to settle on Mars.

00:32.848 --> 00:34.801
Mars One is a not-for-profit organization.

00:35.780 --> 00:39.425
It is working on landing the first crew on Mars in 2023...

00:40.428 --> 00:42.644
...and another crew every two years after that.

00:42.854 --> 00:46.743
Takeoff, landing, and various parts of the mission will be streamed on the Internet...

00:47.043 --> 00:51.035
...with Mars One claiming an estimated potential audience of four billion.

00:51.403 --> 00:55.793
Successful applicants will have to undergo seven years training before the flight...

00:55.886 --> 00:57.307
...which will take seven months.

00:57.569 --> 01:01.060
The one-way nature of the mission has raised questions from some...

01:01.405 --> 01:03.163
...over whether or not it's ethical.

01:03.707 --> 01:07.958
Any big step that you take will always mean that there is risk.

01:08.529 --> 01:12.666
Space missions always include risk and this mission will not be different.

01:12.743 --> 01:14.701
When you send humans to Mars, there will be risks.

01:15.326 --> 01:19.295
But we will select the people and we will tell those people the risks.

01:19.374 --> 01:22.754
They will understand the risks and they will have to weigh the risks.

01:23.289 --> 01:27.046
Do I want to take these risks to make my dream come true or do I not?

01:27.542 --> 01:31.113
And it's up to the people who are going to determine if it's worth it for them.
