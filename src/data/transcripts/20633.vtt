Throughout history, map makers have helped us discover where we were,...

00:03.749 --> 00:04.749
...and where we were going.

00:04.999 --> 00:07.200
But while it may seem like every corner of the world...

00:07.269 --> 00:08.866
...has been surveyed and charted,...

00:09.219 --> 00:12.709
...navigating the world of indoor spaces can still be somewhat vexing.

00:13.304 --> 00:15.813
A map may help you get from your house to the airport...

00:16.275 --> 00:18.613
...but oftentimes it leaves you at the front door.

00:19.312 --> 00:21.923
Many places provide a "You are here" directory.

00:22.463 --> 00:25.475
But if you don't know where "here" is in relation to "there,"...

00:25.832 --> 00:27.087
...you can quickly become lost...

00:27.177 --> 00:30.134
...in a veritable labyrinth of unknown twists and turns.

00:31.012 --> 00:34.429
This is why the mapping folks at Google added indoor Google Maps.

00:35.465 --> 00:37.364
Now it's easy to figure out where you are,...

00:37.915 --> 00:40.717
...orient yourself and even know what floor you're on.

00:41.546 --> 00:43.559
Best of all, this feature now appears...

00:43.708 --> 00:45.926
...right within Google Maps on Android devices,...

00:46.387 --> 00:48.661
...meaning you can plan your trip the whole way through...

00:48.881 --> 00:51.649
...and never worry about getting lost in the wrong department again.
