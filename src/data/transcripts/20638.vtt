00:00.445 --> 00:03.667
We're all taught to eat healthy and be aware of our calorie intake through the day.

00:03.824 --> 00:06.738
But have you ever stopped to think about what those calories look like?

00:07.227 --> 00:10.087
For example, this is 200 calories worth of apple.

00:10.577 --> 00:13.213
On the other hand, if we take 200 calories of cheese,...

00:13.375 --> 00:15.750
...it doesn't look quite the same in terms of volume.

00:16.168 --> 00:19.569
Throw 200 calories of wine into the mix for a nice wine and cheese...

00:19.868 --> 00:23.083
...and you have three very different looking versions of 200 calories.

00:23.577 --> 00:25.974
Now compare that wine to beer or rum...

00:26.286 --> 00:28.938
..and you have three very different party nights for your stomach.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.163
Or how about the eggs you had for breakfast?

00:31.406 --> 00:34.583
Compare that to 200 calories of sweet cereal you had the other day...

00:34.927 --> 00:37.939
...or even some oatmeal and they're bound to seem a bit different.

00:38.201 --> 00:42.515
But if you had gotten a sausage and egg breakfast sandwich, you'll be looking at even less.

00:42.758 --> 00:43.279
Broccoli?

00:43.547 --> 00:46.657
You may be surprised by the amount you can eat before you hit 200 calories,...

00:46.908 --> 00:50.201
...not to mention the stuff is packed with nutrients and a great source of fiber.

00:50.575 --> 00:51.377
A slice of pizza?

00:51.920 --> 00:53.897
Less than a slice if it has pepperoni on it.

00:54.279 --> 00:55.985
And what about the classic Big Mac?

00:56.337 --> 00:58.771
Try a 200-calorie small Mac.

00:58.919 --> 01:03.665
And since calories are simply units of energy, with the calories of 217 Big Macs,...

01:03.879 --> 01:06.147
...you could drive your car 35 kilometers.

01:06.648 --> 01:08.459
So wait, what is a calorie?

01:08.699 --> 01:11.886
Specifically, a calorie is the amount of energy or heat it takes...

01:11.961 --> 01:15.697
...to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius.

01:16.125 --> 01:18.652
We need energy to survive and we get it from food.

01:18.901 --> 01:21.850
Carbohydrates, protein and fats are the building blocks of our food...

01:21.923 --> 01:24.575
...and each contributes a different amount of energy to our bodies.

01:24.973 --> 01:29.407
The average person needs somewhere between 2,000 to 2,700 calories a day...

01:29.727 --> 01:32.515
...depending on factors like height, weight, gender and age.

01:32.761 --> 01:36.467
And some foods like peanut butter are calorie-dense, filling this requirement faster.

01:36.859 --> 01:38.629
Or that muffin you ate as a snack?

01:39.022 --> 01:41.666
Chances are its calorie content is higher than you thought.

01:41.965 --> 01:43.643
And those irresistible Doritos?

01:44.145 --> 01:45.546
Don't lie, you ate the whole bag.

01:45.831 --> 01:50.545
Unlike celery which has very few calories, giving you lots to munch on, or carrots.

01:50.907 --> 01:52.516
Not so much Hershey's Kisses.

01:52.763 --> 01:54.651
And if you're eating salad to limit calories,...

01:54.928 --> 01:58.045
...watch out for creamy dressing, particularly French dressing.

01:58.514 --> 02:01.037
On its own, black coffee is quite low in calories.

02:01.161 --> 02:03.116
You can have a lot before you hit 200 calories.

02:03.435 --> 02:06.978
But once you add one cream and one sugar, those calories quickly add up.

02:07.359 --> 02:10.494
Turn it into a specialty drink like an Iced Peppermint White Mocha...

02:10.840 --> 02:12.617
...and you might be shocked at the amount left.

02:12.918 --> 02:15.039
But just because something has less calories...

02:15.169 --> 02:17.727
...doesn't necessarily mean it's healthier or better for you.

02:18.105 --> 02:22.368
Take for example this 200 calories of Coke versus 200 calories of whole milk.

02:22.857 --> 02:25.708
While it's true that the Coke contains fewer calories per liter,...

02:26.011 --> 02:29.196
...you can't forget that milk contains many nutrients and healthy fats.

02:29.613 --> 02:31.404
Or like brown bread versus white bread.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.764
Yes, whole wheat bread often contains more calories per slice...

02:35.095 --> 02:37.399
...but it also contains more nutrients and fiber.

02:37.716 --> 02:40.619
So counting calories isn't the be-all and end-all.

02:40.808 --> 02:43.941
But thinking about what goes into your body is bound to make a difference.

02:44.247 --> 02:47.181
At the end of the day, eat a healthy and balanced diet.
