Socotra Island is home to some pretty weird animal and plant life,...

00:05.995 --> 00:08.926
...which could raise some questions about which planet it's really on.

00:09.709 --> 00:12.042
It looks more like a 1960s Star Trek set...

00:12.239 --> 00:14.554
...than an island a couple hundred miles off the coast of Yemen.

00:15.282 --> 00:17.562
Likely because Socotra's native plants and animals...

00:17.772 --> 00:19.745
...have had to do some serious adapting...

00:19.819 --> 00:23.036
...to keep up with the island's brutally hot and windy conditions,...

00:23.397 --> 00:26.096
...making many of them completely unique to the locale.

00:26.975 --> 00:30.790
Once the destination for Egyptians and Greeks looking for frankincense, aloe,...

00:30.919 --> 00:32.981
...and the red sap of the dragon's blood tree,...

00:33.320 --> 00:36.002
...the island is now mostly visited by devotees of the weird.

00:36.687 --> 00:39.852
And looking part like an umbrella and part like a giant mushroom,...

00:40.003 --> 00:42.271
...the dragon's blood tree is certainly weird.

00:43.037 --> 00:47.069
Another eye-catching yet eyebrow-raising specimen is Socotran desert rose,...

00:47.235 --> 00:50.242
...which resembles a gargantuan, misshapen root vegetable...

00:50.333 --> 00:52.396
...wearing a tiara of pink flowers.

00:53.215 --> 00:56.775
With 90 percent of its reptiles existing nowhere other than the island,...

00:57.079 --> 00:59.340
...they're bound to be the subjects of some fierce lore.

01:00.022 --> 01:02.792
One endemic chameleon is fabled to render voiceless...

01:02.963 --> 01:04.417
...anyone who hears its hiss.
