00:02.687 --> 00:05.139
ï»¿It's one of the most dreaded announcements on an airplane.

00:05.424 --> 00:08.304
"Please turn off and stow all electronic devices."

00:08.537 --> 00:12.014
And according to the Wall Street Journal, we may soon hear them a lot less.

00:12.193 --> 00:15.749
Federal Aviation Administration advisers are moving to relax rules...

00:15.812 --> 00:20.998
...against cell phones, tablets and other devices on planes travelling at low altitudes.

00:21.108 --> 00:24.512
But passengers will likely soon have more leeway during taxiing...

00:24.633 --> 00:25.933
...and during takeoff and landing.

00:26.114 --> 00:28.841
The recommendations from top-level FAA advisers...

00:29.049 --> 00:32.484
...follow reports that at least one-third of recent airline passengers...

00:32.550 --> 00:36.808
...say they have "accidentally" left an electronic device on in flight.

00:37.051 --> 00:39.995
The Journal says the eventual goal is to enable e-readers...

00:40.068 --> 00:43.073
...and similar contraptions during entire flights.
