00:08.661 --> 00:09.186
ï»¿Steve!

00:09.511 --> 00:11.403
It takes guts to drop out like you did.

00:11.540 --> 00:13.901
Higher education comes at the expense of experience.

00:16.096 --> 00:17.027
Woz!

00:17.185 --> 00:17.773
What are you working on?

00:17.895 --> 00:21.347
It's a computer terminal that hooks up to the TV for the display.

00:27.080 --> 00:27.309
Steve?

00:27.964 --> 00:28.255
Wow!

00:31.556 --> 00:32.670
These are state-of-the-art.

00:32.769 --> 00:34.133
Nobody's making anything like this.

00:38.513 --> 00:39.647
Welcome to Apple Computer.

00:42.481 --> 00:43.127
This is everything?

00:43.805 --> 00:44.431
Sort of.

00:44.744 --> 00:46.749
I think we should start with around 90 grand.

00:47.047 --> 00:47.944
Could you repeat that?

00:48.299 --> 00:49.359
If you'll have me aboard.

00:53.068 --> 00:54.997
Apple Incorporated went public this morning.

00:58.930 --> 01:01.718
We got to make the small things unforgettable.

01:01.900 --> 01:03.707
Typeface isn't a pressing issue.

01:03.915 --> 01:04.162
Get out!

01:05.751 --> 01:08.027
He's trying to start a war with IBM!

01:09.584 --> 01:12.560
Steve's been doing the impossible ever since he was in a garage.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.491
I'm trying to build Apple and they're taking it away from me?

01:15.959 --> 01:18.938
If you keep heading down this path, I will not protect you.

01:19.288 --> 01:20.317
It's a blatant rip-off.

01:20.409 --> 01:22.727
I'm going to sue you for every cent!

01:22.874 --> 01:25.311
You are your own worst enemy.

01:27.334 --> 01:28.427
The board is unanimous.

01:28.690 --> 01:31.213
Steve will no longer be involved in this company.

01:35.547 --> 01:39.437
Ten years after Steve Jobs' departure, the future of Apple Computer is in jeopardy.

01:40.229 --> 01:42.738
In life, you'll only get to do so many things.

01:45.393 --> 01:46.972
We're making Apple cool again.

01:50.287 --> 01:51.537
Here's to the crazy ones,...

01:53.047 --> 01:53.746
...the misfits,...

01:54.448 --> 01:55.035
...the rebels.

01:58.217 --> 02:01.805
Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world...

02:02.539 --> 02:03.457
...are the ones who do.

02:08.464 --> 02:10.484
If we're going to do this thing, we need to come up with a name.

02:11.246 --> 02:11.644
Apple!

02:12.244 --> 02:15.611
That is so much better than Phaser Beam Computers.
