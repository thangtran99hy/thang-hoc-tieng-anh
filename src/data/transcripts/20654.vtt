00:03.505 --> 00:06.226
I think that there's definitely somebody out there.

00:06.455 --> 00:10.070
Taking a page from the speculative dreams of Carl Sagan,...

00:10.287 --> 00:14.014
...a group of scientists and entrepreneurs are devising a system...

00:14.178 --> 00:16.703
...to take earthly messages deep into space.

00:16.880 --> 00:18.895
And they want you to join in.

00:19.291 --> 00:21.032
Yeah, I think there is something up there.

00:21.404 --> 00:26.383
The Lone Signal Project will be the first continuous transmission from Earth,...

00:26.641 --> 00:29.490
...beamed with a hope there's someone out there to listen.

00:29.608 --> 00:31.598
We should send messages to aliens.

00:31.670 --> 00:39.281
Aimed at Gliese 526, a possible habitable star system about 17.6 light years from Earth,...

00:39.519 --> 00:44.531
...the communications will be blasted from a Jamesburg Earth Station dish in California.

00:44.961 --> 00:50.759
The team has invited everyone to participate with one free text message-sized contribution,...

00:50.779 --> 00:53.177
I hope they realize I'm one of them.

00:53.357 --> 00:56.917
...offering more sizable custom transmissions for a fee.

00:57.105 --> 01:00.445
I mean, really, I'm in love with this one man.

01:00.875 --> 01:04.493
Lone Star will even allow people to track the progress of their messages...

01:04.713 --> 01:07.995
...as they hurdle toward Gliese 526.

01:08.534 --> 01:13.867
Apparently, not everyone is charmed by the open-sourced, extraterrestrial life-seeking mission.

01:14.145 --> 01:14.930
So why not?

01:15.376 --> 01:18.185
A headline in The Verge asked ominously,...

01:18.648 --> 01:23.977
..."Are alien hunting scientists going to trigger a planetary invasion?"

01:24.237 --> 01:25.363
Please don't hurt us.
