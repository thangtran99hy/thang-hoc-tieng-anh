Britain, isn't it time you said goodbye to your unloved rooms?

00:05.244 --> 00:06.497
We've all got one.

00:08.755 --> 00:11.093
A cupboard that used to be a bedroom.

00:11.445 --> 00:15.446
A kitchen that's slowly become an assault course.

00:15.728 --> 00:18.404
A jungle that should've been a lawn.

00:19.245 --> 00:22.138
The room with no name.

00:23.635 --> 00:26.773
And the barbecue that time forgot.

00:27.439 --> 00:28.963
You can do it Britain.

00:29.170 --> 00:34.712
Take up your wallpaper brushes, your wood stain, and your barbecue charcoals.

00:35.021 --> 00:38.823
Fire up those lawn mowers and grab your grout guns.

00:39.509 --> 00:43.561
And turn the unloved into the unbelievable.

00:44.309 --> 00:50.491
So we can once more love our living rooms, bedazzle our bedrooms,...

00:50.775 --> 00:54.096
...and make our spare rooms feel special again.

00:54.397 --> 00:58.786
