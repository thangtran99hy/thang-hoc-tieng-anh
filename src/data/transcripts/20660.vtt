ï»¿Welcome back to the Seat Pleasant 2:35 PM Draft.

00:03.235 --> 00:06.307
Shirts have the first pick, but the question is will they go with Kevin Durant...

00:06.548 --> 00:09.286
...a four-time NBA all-star; he's back in town to play,...

00:09.556 --> 00:13.709
...or with local spark plug Anton Barrels; he's a regular here.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.715
He can't ball; he's just tall.

00:16.868 --> 00:17.904
Have you seen my highlights?

00:18.255 --> 00:21.218
Durant's got guard-like skills in a big man's body.

00:21.345 --> 00:23.499
He's got a wingspan that goes on for days.

00:23.629 --> 00:25.874
But Anton Barrels has scouts intrigued.

00:26.190 --> 00:28.893
This guy is like a bowling ball; he's got a low center of gravity...

00:28.969 --> 00:31.499
...so you can't get up underneath him, and he never backs down.

00:31.725 --> 00:34.082
Well the moment has come, let's go to the podium.

00:36.092 --> 00:42.499
And with the first pick in the 2:35 Seat Pleasant Draft, the Shirts select...

00:48.687 --> 00:49.633
...Kevin Durant.

00:49.829 --> 00:50.265
What?
