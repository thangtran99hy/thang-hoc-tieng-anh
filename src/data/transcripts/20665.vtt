Area 51, Roswell, New Mexico, crop circles and unidentified flying objects.

00:06.796 --> 00:09.081
Does life exist outside planet Earth?

00:09.477 --> 00:12.921
And if so, have we been visited by alien beings?

00:13.505 --> 00:14.591
Let's take a look.

00:15.211 --> 00:18.832
A case for the existence of alien life forms has been made for millennia...

00:19.025 --> 00:22.118
...but definitely gained steam in the United States in 1947...

00:22.316 --> 00:28.915
...when the Roswell army airfield issued a press release that it had recovered a crashed flying disc.

00:29.521 --> 00:32.565
The Air Force quickly made the retraction explaining that the flying disc...

00:32.663 --> 00:35.156
...was actually a radar tracking weather balloon,...

00:35.545 --> 00:37.397
...which is a little fishy, don't you think?

00:37.788 --> 00:43.169
The government also said it recovered a couple alien bodies, I mean, dead weathermen.

00:43.840 --> 00:45.977
While declassified information about Roswell...

00:46.300 --> 00:49.604
...continues to be debated by UFO skeptics and proponents alike,...

00:50.123 --> 00:55.683
...another highly contested phenomenon suggesting the existence of alien life is crop circles.

00:56.110 --> 00:59.178
Some UFO supporters claim that these elaborate formations...

00:59.251 --> 01:02.165
...may be communications from extraterrestrial beings.

01:02.699 --> 01:06.785
Although hoaxes involving crop circles had been rampant since the 1970s.

01:07.267 --> 01:12.501
While things like flying saucers and alien abductions are largely discredited by scientists,...

01:12.972 --> 01:16.882
...many high-profile astrophysicists like Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking...

01:17.091 --> 01:20.695
...have suggested that alien life is not only possible throughout the universe...

01:21.102 --> 01:24.036
...but probable due in part to its immense size.

01:24.593 --> 01:27.478
But rather than gangly oblong-headed greenies,...

01:27.987 --> 01:31.772
...these arguments were more in favor of organic life such as bacteria.

01:32.203 --> 01:35.651
No matter how you slice it, making contact with extraterrestrials...

01:35.716 --> 01:38.429
...is a subject that continually fascinates us all.

01:38.667 --> 01:40.845
And ever since people have walked the face of the Earth,...

01:40.987 --> 01:44.481
...we've had our heads turned skyward marveling at the wonder of it all.

01:45.104 --> 01:48.359
And whether strange lights turned out to be nothing more than helicopters...

01:48.494 --> 01:51.829
...or cases of alien abductions turned out to be fabrications,...

01:52.471 --> 01:55.284
...wondering whether or not we're alone in the universe,...

01:55.493 --> 01:59.491
...is one thing that makes us utterly and totally human.
