00:06.304 --> 00:07.303
So, here's a common question.

00:09.370 --> 00:10.541
Can you cry in space?

00:10.811 --> 00:11.477
Do tears work?

00:13.083 --> 00:13.957
Well, let's try it out.

00:14.557 --> 00:18.438
I can't cry on command, but I'm gonna take some water, drinking water,...

00:20.363 --> 00:21.881
...put it in my eye just as if I was crying.

00:21.989 --> 00:22.755
Let's see what happens.

00:23.301 --> 00:25.112
Get myself nice and stable for you here.

00:26.567 --> 00:26.855
Here we go.

00:31.774 --> 00:36.109
So, just as if I've started crying, my eye is full of tears.

00:38.537 --> 00:40.901
But you can see, it just forms a ball on my eye.

00:41.359 --> 00:42.785
In fact, I can put more water in.

00:46.534 --> 00:52.225
And so if you keep crying, you'll just develop with a bigger and bigger ball of water in your eye,...

00:53.269 --> 00:57.825
...until eventually, it crosses across your nose and gets into your other eye,...

00:58.421 --> 01:02.122
...or evaporates or maybe spreads over your cheek or...

01:03.067 --> 01:04.224
...you grab a towel and dry it up.

01:06.801 --> 01:08.155
So yes, I've gotten things in my eye.

01:09.014 --> 01:10.637
Your eyes will definitely cry in space.

01:11.375 --> 01:14.008
But the big difference is, tears don't fall.

01:16.307 --> 01:17.041
So grab a hanky.
