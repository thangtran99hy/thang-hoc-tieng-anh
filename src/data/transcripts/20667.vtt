00:04.641 --> 00:06.243
What will tomorrow look like?

00:07.275 --> 00:08.905
Our world is at its limits.

00:09.629 --> 00:11.721
And yet we all want more.

00:12.773 --> 00:13.485
And why not?

00:14.171 --> 00:16.034
Why shouldn't the future be brighter than today?

00:16.983 --> 00:18.119
But where will it come from?

00:19.135 --> 00:19.535
Simple.

00:22.341 --> 00:28.421
Our tiny planet sits in a vast sea of resources, including millions of asteroids...

00:28.752 --> 00:31.987
...bathed in the sun's free energy 24 hours a day.

00:33.109 --> 00:35.159
The same rocks that could fall from our skies...

00:35.251 --> 00:37.735
...also contain everything we could ever need.

00:38.762 --> 00:40.871
Both out there and down here.

00:41.943 --> 00:44.390
It's time someone seized the opportunity.

00:47.550 --> 00:48.959
Deep Space Industries.

00:51.508 --> 00:54.569
Deep Space is a new kind of company with a new kind of plan.

00:55.105 --> 00:56.219
We don't build rockets.

00:56.441 --> 00:57.440
We don't do astronomy.

00:57.787 --> 01:01.370
We are explorers and harvesters, makers and suppliers.

01:03.403 --> 01:05.841
As they say, "timing is everything".

01:06.403 --> 01:09.228
And for space, right now is that time.

01:10.532 --> 01:13.099
In fact, some of the planet's most successful people...

01:13.179 --> 01:15.485
...are placing their bets on this new frontier.

01:18.822 --> 01:22.915
Meanwhile, NASA and others are planning new missions to the Moon and Mars...

01:23.087 --> 01:25.113
...and new space facilities in free space,...

01:25.209 --> 01:29.156
...joining the billions of dollars worth of communication satellites already in orbit.

01:30.771 --> 01:35.533
And as they reach beyond Earth orbit, Deep Space Industries will be there...

01:35.755 --> 01:39.287
...with the fuel, air and materials they need to succeed and grow.
