Hi, my name is Andrea from Elegant Affairs,...

00:09.203 --> 00:11.535
...and these are foods for Bastille Day.

00:14.517 --> 00:19.156
To my right, I have French fries; in French they are called "pommes frites".

00:19.397 --> 00:21.239
The perfect choice for Bastille Day.

00:21.345 --> 00:25.025
But what makes them interesting is we put them in these little paper cones,...

00:25.139 --> 00:30.315
...which you can easily make yourself by buying French-themed craft paper at the store.

00:30.872 --> 00:33.451
Secondly, French onion soup.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.863
Just take a little bit of French onion soup,...

00:35.943 --> 00:38.954
...you can make your own or serve it from the can,...

00:39.209 --> 00:43.239
...and make it interesting by putting them in these little white sake cups.

00:44.015 --> 00:48.421
Then you can make grilled cheese in the oven, but not just ordinary grilled cheese:...

00:48.603 --> 00:52.547
...a croque-monsieur, which is ham and Swiss and a little bit of mustard.

00:52.868 --> 00:56.285
Cut them into bars and put them right on top of the sake cups.

00:56.446 --> 00:59.333
They make a really fun Bastille Day treat.

00:59.853 --> 01:03.363
And last but not least, we have French macaroons.

01:03.673 --> 01:08.824
French macaroons are the perfect ending to a Bastille Day celebration.

01:09.245 --> 01:11.913
I'm Andrea Correale from Elegant Affairs,...

01:12.231 --> 01:14.979
...and these are fun food ideas for Bastille Day.
