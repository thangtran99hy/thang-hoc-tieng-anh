Taiwan's coffee drinkers are more discriminating than ever,...

00:03.454 --> 00:07.133
...and coffee shops are looking for new ways to win their loyalty,...

00:07.503 --> 00:10.543
...including coming up with some innovative flavors.

00:14.432 --> 00:16.429
Consumers are lined up to take advantage of this...

00:16.525 --> 00:19.033
...coffee chain's "Buy one, get one free" promotion.

00:19.515 --> 00:22.581
It's been so successful that the store ran out of regular milk...

00:22.871 --> 00:24.882
...and had to use soy milk in its place.

00:27.487 --> 00:29.604
I've never had soy milk in coffee before.

00:29.957 --> 00:31.165
Today is the first time.

00:31.468 --> 00:34.914
It has as an extra taste of soy, and I'm pretty surprised that I can accept it.

00:35.243 --> 00:38.405
In fact, soy milk has been used in coffee for a long time,...

00:38.878 --> 00:42.513
...but there are a number of other unusual coffee brews that are appearing on the market.

00:43.755 --> 00:47.273
A few ginger slices, some ice and freshly brewed coffee,...

00:47.608 --> 00:49.498
...all poured into a half a cup of Sprite.

00:50.063 --> 00:53.127
Sprinkle a few ginger slivers for decoration and voila,...

00:53.461 --> 00:55.301
...a spicy and fragrant ginger coffee.

00:57.424 --> 00:59.829
After drinking it, your whole body heats up.

01:00.158 --> 01:01.324
I'm already starting to sweat.

01:01.907 --> 01:04.946
The coffee shop has also developed a red bean milk coffee...

01:05.148 --> 01:07.456
...and a fruit coffee with strawberry jam and cocoa.

01:08.149 --> 01:11.313
This trend toward more innovative flavors is likely to continue...

01:11.687 --> 01:15.053
...as coffee shops try to appeal to more discriminating consumers.
