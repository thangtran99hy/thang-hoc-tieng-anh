ï»¿What's up everybody, Daemon here with IGN News.

00:04.297 --> 00:07.045
Christian Bale is in talks to reprise his role as Batman,...

00:07.106 --> 00:09.097
...in DC's upcoming "Justice League" movie.

00:09.508 --> 00:11.919
If a new report from "Latino Review" is to be believed,...

00:12.178 --> 00:13.823
...Christopher Nolan will oversee the project...

00:14.041 --> 00:17.469
...and "Man of Steel" director Zack Snyder will produce and possibly direct.

00:18.329 --> 00:22.555
The website claims that Nolan is now in charge of the entire DC Universe at Warner Bros...

00:22.799 --> 00:25.762
...and is in discussions to act as a sort of "godfather" to the project.

00:26.107 --> 00:29.079
The studio allegedly wants the film to be set in the same universe...

00:29.325 --> 00:30.684
...as Nolan's "Dark Knight" trilogy,...

00:30.956 --> 00:33.034
...which naturally means a return of Bale's Batman.

00:33.476 --> 00:37.513
Not only that, but "Justice League" would also tie in with Snyder's gritty "Man of Steel"...

00:37.829 --> 00:39.229
...which means, you guessed it,...

00:39.512 --> 00:42.796
...Bale's Batman and Henry Cavill's Superman would appear in the same universe...

00:42.895 --> 00:44.529
...in the same movie at the same time.

00:45.135 --> 00:48.356
Bale wouldn't be against reprising the role as long as the story was right.

00:48.769 --> 00:50.816
"I would love the challenge of making a fourth one work,"...

00:51.139 --> 00:53.063
...he told "Empire Magazine" last summer.

00:53.391 --> 00:56.049
Considering Marvel hit the billion-dollar jackpot with "The Avengers,"...

00:56.239 --> 00:58.525
...Warner Bros. is certainly imagining what it could achieve...

00:58.747 --> 01:01.037
...by crossing over its top two DC properties.

01:01.365 --> 01:04.221
"Avengers" is the third highest grossing movie of all time.

01:04.921 --> 01:07.449
If "Justice League" is released in 2015 as planned,...

01:07.557 --> 01:10.182
...it will go up against "The Avengers 2" in the same year.

01:10.887 --> 01:14.351
As soon as we know more about Batman, "Justice League", and all things DC Universe...

01:14.589 --> 01:15.879
...we'll let you know right here at IGN.
