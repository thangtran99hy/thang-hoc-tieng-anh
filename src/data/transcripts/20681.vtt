00:06.517 --> 00:09.795
Ramadan is a time of spiritual purification and fasting,...

00:10.165 --> 00:12.554
...but the fasting can take a toll on your body.

00:13.414 --> 00:16.037
Follow these steps to stay healthy during Ramadan.

00:16.933 --> 00:23.763
You will need water, nutritious food, light exercise and normal portion sizes.

00:24.352 --> 00:26.656
Optional: wheat bran or oatmeal.

00:27.225 --> 00:31.286
Step one: Drink plenty of water during fasting breaks.

00:31.931 --> 00:34.731
When you are fasting, it is easy to become dehydrated.

00:35.190 --> 00:39.318
Dehydration can cause headaches, fatigue, dizziness and irritability.

00:40.363 --> 00:44.969
To determine the amount of water your body needs daily, divide your body weight in half.

00:45.779 --> 00:49.178
Half of your body weight is the amount of water you need in ounces.

00:49.718 --> 00:53.145
Step two: Eat nutritious food when you break the fast.

00:53.894 --> 00:55.339
Stick to the major food groups...

00:55.406 --> 01:01.340
...including bread and cereal, milk and dairy products, fish, meat and vegetables and fruit.

01:02.375 --> 01:05.510
Fruit assists with digestion and helps prevent constipation.

01:06.142 --> 01:08.449
Step three: Eat slowly.

01:09.096 --> 01:10.452
The longer you chew your food,...

01:10.570 --> 01:14.557
...the less work your digestive tract needs to do, absorbing more nutrients.

01:15.222 --> 01:18.037
Step four: Don't skip Suhur.

01:18.571 --> 01:21.710
Suhur, the pre-dawn meal, will give you the energy you need...

01:21.853 --> 01:23.908
...for your daily activities while fasting.

01:24.866 --> 01:27.020
Eat wheat bran or oatmeal at Suhur.

01:27.416 --> 01:30.590
Wheat bran and oatmeal are great sources of dietary fibers.

01:30.971 --> 01:34.361
Dietary fibers help dissolve harmful toxins from the body.

01:34.968 --> 01:38.901
Step five: Exercise, but be careful not to overdo it.

01:39.587 --> 01:43.643
Light exercise helps maintain your energy level when you are not consuming food.

01:44.213 --> 01:48.111
Step six: Eat normal portion sizes at Iftar.

01:48.830 --> 01:51.575
Iftar should consist of a normal serving or less.

01:52.381 --> 01:53.964
Stay healthy during Ramadan.

01:54.242 --> 01:57.472
Eating too much at Iftar can create an overload of sugar in the blood...

01:57.539 --> 01:59.029
...and cause damage to the body.

01:59.859 --> 02:00.399
Did you know?

02:00.823 --> 02:02.516
In most Muslim parts of the world,...

02:02.619 --> 02:06.386
...restaurants and coffee shops are closed from dusk to dawn during Ramadan.
