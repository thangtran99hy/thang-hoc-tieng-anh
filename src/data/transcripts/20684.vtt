00:02.668 --> 00:05.181
World War III: maybe I could've stopped it...

00:05.727 --> 00:07.908
...if I just ran a little faster.

00:09.544 --> 00:10.591
Faster!

00:13.500 --> 00:16.799
The speed force allows the Reverse-Flash to travel through time.

00:20.511 --> 00:22.123
He changed something in the past.

00:22.237 --> 00:26.255
We have to find out what he changed and change it back before they kill everyone on the planet.

00:32.665 --> 00:34.440
In my world, I'm a hero.

00:34.991 --> 00:36.466
You mean like Batman?

00:37.751 --> 00:41.354
No matter how fast you run, you can't save everyone.

00:41.496 --> 00:42.419
We're running out of time.

00:43.025 --> 00:43.884
War is over.

00:44.183 --> 00:45.345
Everybody lost.

00:45.439 --> 00:46.275
No!

00:49.396 --> 00:52.551
You'd be amazed at the monsters this world can create.
