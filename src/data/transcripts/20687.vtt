00:01.795 --> 00:02.544
Meet Carl.

00:02.751 --> 00:05.819
Carl just purchased a Toshiba Satellite S Series laptop.

00:06.089 --> 00:10.123
He was initially attracted to the premium brushed aluminum ice blue finish,...

00:10.213 --> 00:13.105
...which to Carl is a symbol of power and domination.

00:13.779 --> 00:15.213
From empowering employees...

00:15.287 --> 00:16.070
Sure thing, boss.

00:16.269 --> 00:18.347
...to power trips and power lunches.

00:18.826 --> 00:22.358
Carl demands power and performance in everything he does.

00:22.511 --> 00:27.550
Which is why he elected for the Satellite S Series with an Intel i7 quad-core processor.

00:27.648 --> 00:29.943
Its power and performance perfected.

00:31.029 --> 00:33.565
And when Carl puts in a late night,...

00:33.706 --> 00:39.331
...the full-size raised tile backlit keyboard will illuminate that ten key like a beacon in the night.

00:39.626 --> 00:41.508
Calculate those calculations, Carl.

00:41.739 --> 00:43.487
Nothing can stop you now.

00:44.041 --> 00:47.255
He's closing deals at all hours without ever leaving his desk...

00:47.344 --> 00:50.877
...with his high-def webcam and chambered Harman/Kardon speakers.

00:51.280 --> 00:56.056
This kind of firepower is like Carl can be anywhere, almost real life.

00:56.251 --> 00:58.317
It looks like that meeting paid off, Carl.

00:58.664 --> 01:03.631
Time to grab that HD display with LED backlighting and meet the boys for Happy Hour.

01:03.894 --> 01:07.611
For Carl, it's always Happy Hour with his Toshiba Satellite S Series.

01:07.783 --> 01:10.550
Well played sir, well played.
