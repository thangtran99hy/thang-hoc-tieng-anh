We've all seen the flashy intro, the catchy music, and some great special effects,...

00:06.452 --> 00:10.380
...but in real life, a crime lab isn't anything like what you see on CSI.

00:10.727 --> 00:13.420
This instrument on television will tell you everything...

00:13.566 --> 00:16.363
...from someone's DNA profile to what kind of metal is in something.

00:16.647 --> 00:20.503
Corey Winar manages the Oregon State Police crime lab in Central Point.

00:20.775 --> 00:23.513
He says what you see on CSI can be deceiving.

00:23.823 --> 00:27.439
This would say something like 'lipstick', which it doesn't really do.

00:27.644 --> 00:32.356
Winar says the limitations of reality and the expectations driven by television...

00:32.428 --> 00:34.841
...are problems he deals with all the time.

00:35.219 --> 00:38.874
It has impacted what the expectation from our customers are from us,...

00:39.393 --> 00:44.043
...and a lot of it is for us to educate them on what we can't even do that analysis.

00:44.169 --> 00:46.798
The customers he's talking about are law enforcement...

00:47.074 --> 00:49.233
...and while there is a lot of technology out there,...

00:49.350 --> 00:51.905
...it doesn't work the way it does on the silver screen.

00:52.269 --> 00:56.857
Not every criminal leaves a key piece of physical evidence linking them alone to the crime.

00:57.157 --> 01:01.376
We find prints at a lot of scenes that don't necessarily match the suspect...

01:01.481 --> 01:03.410
...or anybody else that we've been able to locate.

01:03.647 --> 01:06.858
Keith Ostrander is a forensic technician for Medford Police.

01:07.004 --> 01:08.916
His specialty is fingerprints.

01:09.349 --> 01:12.385
He says, unfortunately, in real life, there's no magic machine...

01:12.503 --> 01:16.321
...where police can scan in a print and pop out a match in five seconds.

01:16.731 --> 01:18.691
So what it does, it actually gives a list of candidates,...

01:18.777 --> 01:23.427
...it's in a way on-screen, we go through there and look at them and say yes or no on those candidates.
