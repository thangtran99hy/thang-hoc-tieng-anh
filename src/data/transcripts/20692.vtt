Here's Doctor James Dobson with Family Talk.

00:03.637 --> 00:07.924
Why do some children love to work and others get depressed just thinking about it?

00:08.479 --> 00:10.797
Well, some of the difference can be traced to temperaments...

00:10.916 --> 00:14.181
...but generally speaking, children learn what they've been taught.

00:14.269 --> 00:18.422
Some well-meaning parents think childhood should not be encumbered by work.

00:18.818 --> 00:23.272
Life is hard enough, they conclude, without making children do what they don't want to do.

00:23.990 --> 00:27.299
But if children aren't at least exposed to work at a young age,...

00:27.611 --> 00:32.213
...they may fail to develop the persistence and initiative required for successful living.

00:32.745 --> 00:37.677
Author Jean Lush says household chores should be divided into two general categories:...

00:38.053 --> 00:40.663
...routine contributions and extra jobs.

00:41.091 --> 00:44.368
The routine, such as making beds or emptying trash cans,...

00:44.761 --> 00:47.626
...should be part of the children's unpaid responsibilities.

00:47.991 --> 00:51.899
But extra jobs should provide opportunities to earn additional money.

00:52.463 --> 00:57.258
Furthermore, children learn by imitation so concentrate on hands-on instruction.

00:57.697 --> 00:59.779
Instead of saying, "Go make your bed!"...

01:00.189 --> 01:01.858
...do the task with the child.

01:02.229 --> 01:07.639
Working with an adult is the most enriching form of play for a child if it's handled right.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.898
Find things to laugh about.

01:10.323 --> 01:15.599
If you nag or constantly correct your child, he'll build up a negative attitude toward work.

01:15.911 --> 01:19.916
Of course, teaching children how to work is itself difficult for parents.

01:20.357 --> 01:23.145
But the benefits of your time and effort would be evident...

01:23.244 --> 01:26.387
...when your child is productive and responsible later on.
