ï»¿Dear Madison, the weekend is coming and I'm thinking of spending some quiet time alone.

00:19.913 --> 00:22.419
Being out here helps me see things more clearly.

00:23.349 --> 00:27.443
I can't say I miss city life. Your brother on the other hand,...

00:29.704 --> 00:33.484
...I think that you and the family need to think of something else as far as his occupation.

00:35.204 --> 00:37.637
He quite realistically could never amount to anything.

00:38.501 --> 00:40.653
Sometimes, I wonder if he is learning disabled.

00:40.812 --> 00:41.424
Lab coat?

00:42.623 --> 00:44.090
Or has a bad disease.

00:44.702 --> 00:45.729
There's birds in here.

00:46.539 --> 00:46.753
What?

00:48.963 --> 00:50.571
Not that I dislike him or anything.

00:53.028 --> 00:54.935
You're the worst person in the world!

00:55.720 --> 00:56.744
He's totally fine.
