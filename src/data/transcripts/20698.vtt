Chefs are the world's worst delegators; so we have these sort of recipes in our mind...

00:16.335 --> 00:18.220
...that we're not very good at writing down and becoming consistent.

00:18.616 --> 00:23.175
The importance of putting recipes together establishes a consistent high mark...

00:23.249 --> 00:24.563
...in terms of cooking standards.

00:24.928 --> 00:28.147
So putting a recipe together, fine tuning it is paramount.

00:28.265 --> 00:30.381
Teaching somebody that recipe is even greater.

00:30.741 --> 00:33.968
The art of success in terms of business is delegation.

00:34.519 --> 00:40.705
I've got 1,750 chefs and waiters in my team and I need to teach young chefs...

00:40.811 --> 00:42.860
...the importance of how to cook properly.

00:43.239 --> 00:44.722
The first thing you do is teach them how to taste.

00:45.115 --> 00:48.028
If you don't understand how it tastes perfectly, then you shouldn't be cooking it.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.921
But if you know how something tastes perfectly, you cook it ten times better.

00:50.985 --> 00:55.478
So, we have a bit of an old-fashioned scenario: you focus on taste, and then we cook.
