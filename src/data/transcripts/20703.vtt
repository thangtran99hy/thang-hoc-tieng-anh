If you're heading to Pamplona, Spain to take part in the running of the bulls,...

00:10.343 --> 00:11.784
...bone up on these racing tips.

00:13.060 --> 00:17.550
You will need: bravery, sobriety, alertness,...

00:17.903 --> 00:21.628
...comfortable clothes, running shoes and common sense.

00:21.828 --> 00:25.626
Participating in the running of the bulls can lead to serious injury or death.

00:26.548 --> 00:28.562
Step 1: Get the background.

00:29.046 --> 00:32.779
The running of the bulls is a half-mile race through the streets of Pamplona, Spain...

00:32.876 --> 00:36.589
...to the town's bullring, featuring the six bulls who'll be fighting that evening,...

00:36.685 --> 00:38.561
...and anyone who dares to run with them.

00:39.202 --> 00:42.527
Runs take place every morning during the annual eight-day festival...

00:42.597 --> 00:45.420
...honoring San Fermin, the town's patron saint.

00:45.865 --> 00:51.279
The festival runs from July 7 through July 14th every year, and anyone over 18 may participate.

00:52.263 --> 00:57.558
Step 2: Understand what you're up against: six one-ton bulls that can outrun most humans,...

00:58.033 --> 00:59.753
...and eight oxen that herd them along.

01:00.286 --> 01:04.465
Different breeds run on different days; some are considered more dangerous than others.

01:05.221 --> 01:09.115
The website "sanfermin.com" lists which breeds are running each day...

01:09.249 --> 01:12.716
...and information about the history of injuries during the running of the bulls.

01:13.377 --> 01:18.412
Step 3: Get a good night's sleep the night before the running of the bulls and stay sober,...

01:18.787 --> 01:21.429
...otherwise you'll be a danger to yourself and others.

01:21.569 --> 01:24.894
Wear comfortable clothes and running shoes and don't carry anything.

01:25.404 --> 01:27.641
Don't run with friends; they might distract you.

01:28.222 --> 01:33.608
Step 4: Enter the Plaza Consistorial before 7:30 am via the gates on the square.

01:33.951 --> 01:36.378
When the police barriers open to the bull run route,...

01:36.547 --> 01:38.759
...go to any spot you like to await the bulls.

01:39.073 --> 01:43.217
The Santo Domingo and callejon sections of the route are considered the most dangerous,...

01:43.342 --> 01:45.150
...as most fatalities have occurred there.

01:46.230 --> 01:49.131
Step 5: Listen for the sound of the rockets.

01:49.491 --> 01:52.459
The first one indicates the gate to the corral is being opened;...

01:52.741 --> 01:56.417
...the second alerts runners that all the bulls are out of the pen and on their way.

01:56.760 --> 01:59.001
In other words, it's time to start running!

01:59.843 --> 02:04.517
Step 6: If you fall, stay down, cover your head, and remain still.

02:05.097 --> 02:09.160
If you remain on the ground, the bulls are likelier to just run by or over you.

02:09.541 --> 02:12.143
If you attempt to get up, they may try to gore you.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.450
Beware of pileups around turns.

02:15.079 --> 02:17.819
Bulls are most dangerous when they separate from the herd,...

02:17.944 --> 02:20.099
...either by running in front or lagging behind.

02:21.284 --> 02:25.386
Step 7: If you make it to the bullring without getting gored or trampled,..

02:25.779 --> 02:28.071
...fan out to its edges as soon as you're inside,...

02:28.329 --> 02:31.550
...running to the middle of the ring is like putting a bull's-eye on your back.

02:32.049 --> 02:32.728
Did you know?

02:33.281 --> 02:36.331
The running of the bulls, called "El Encierro" in Spanish,...

02:36.456 --> 02:41.159
...has been going on informally since the Middle Ages, but was regulated in 1867.
