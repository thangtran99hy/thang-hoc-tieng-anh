In the Washington suburbs, salespeople at this grocery store selling halal foods...

00:05.747 --> 00:09.471
...are trying to keep up with demand right before the beginning of Ramadan.

00:09.999 --> 00:12.100
For Muslims, it's a special time of the year.

00:12.330 --> 00:17.584
It's a peaceful month and a month of mercy and it gives me a lot of energy.

00:17.877 --> 00:20.427
Several million Muslims make the US their home.

00:20.926 --> 00:25.124
Many observe the fast in America as Muslims do overseas.

00:25.451 --> 00:27.505
In my opinion there is not any difference.

00:27.753 --> 00:28.569
That the rule is one.

00:29.489 --> 00:31.625
There is no different kind of rule, Ramadan is Ramadan.

00:32.294 --> 00:33.884
So maybe the difference is the time.

00:34.676 --> 00:38.573
In our country, the time is 12 hours of night, 12 hours of day.

00:38.981 --> 00:43.342
But here, it's maybe a little bit longer that we fast.

00:43.475 --> 00:46.065
That is the only one I see is the difference.

00:46.595 --> 00:49.687
Muslims fast during the day and break the fast at nightfall.

00:50.185 --> 00:52.453
Many like foods that are special for Ramadan.

00:52.817 --> 00:55.331
While these shoppers are trying to wrap up their shopping...

00:55.499 --> 00:56.705
...before the start of Ramadan,...

00:57.145 --> 01:00.159
...the shop owner is trying to stock everything they want.

01:00.423 --> 01:04.945
During the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan,....

01:06.135 --> 01:16.514
...mostly Muslims focus on fresh dates, meats,...

01:16.682 --> 01:22.391
...all kinds of meats, halal meat, plus spices, fruits.

01:22.568 --> 01:28.542
I already got enough dates and all kinds of supplies for Ramadan.

01:28.996 --> 01:32.508
Many stores adjust their hours to suit the needs of their customers.

01:32.663 --> 01:35.477
During the Ramadan, of course,...
