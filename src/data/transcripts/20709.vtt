00:01.337 --> 00:05.646
In 2009, the country of Samoa prohibited the sale of alcohol for three days...

00:05.899 --> 00:07.738
...to keep people safe while the island nation...

00:07.819 --> 00:09.671
...switched from driving on the right side of the road...

00:09.868 --> 00:10.854
...to driving on the left.

00:11.112 --> 00:14.001
The switch was so Samoans could get cheap hand-me-down cars...

00:14.137 --> 00:16.656
...from nearby left-side driving New Zealand and Australia.

00:16.869 --> 00:18.337
But Samoans weren't too pleased...

00:18.490 --> 00:21.252
...since most of the cars they owned were designed to drive on the right.

00:21.448 --> 00:24.585
In fact, two out of three Earthlings drive on the right.

00:24.778 --> 00:25.484
But why?

00:25.765 --> 00:28.840
There aren't clear and obvious reasons to choose one side over the other.

00:29.035 --> 00:31.893
So the origin of driving conventions is a perfect opportunity...

00:31.995 --> 00:34.235
...for the mathematics of game theory and symmetry breaking.

00:34.377 --> 00:36.045
Or we can just look at historical evidence.

00:36.289 --> 00:40.542
Today's rules evolved from driving livestock and carts on the earliest roads.

00:40.755 --> 00:43.435
Archaeologists view deeper grooves on the left lane...

00:43.515 --> 00:45.223
...leaving an ancient Roman quarry in England...

00:45.313 --> 00:49.127
...as evidence for left-side traffic, since departing wagons would've had heavier loads.

00:49.535 --> 00:52.328
And it's possible that this left side convention was in place...

00:52.406 --> 00:54.922
...so right-handed soldiers and knights could draw their weapons....

00:55.007 --> 00:56.625
...more quickly against passing enemies.

00:56.992 --> 01:01.111
Whatever the reason, keeping to the left was eventually made into law in England in 1835.

01:01.329 --> 01:04.189
And today, most people who drive on the left side live in countries...

01:04.269 --> 01:07.540
...like India, South Africa and Australia, which were once British colonies.

01:07.815 --> 01:10.756
But that doesn't explain why the rest of the world drives on the right.

01:10.917 --> 01:13.030
Some claim that following the French Revolution,...

01:13.165 --> 01:17.510
...drivers there switched to the right to reject the practices of their overthrown aristocracy,...

01:17.648 --> 01:20.616
...while others suggest the French drove on the right all along.

01:20.829 --> 01:24.502
Regardless, driving on the right side of the road did spread across much of Europe...

01:24.621 --> 01:26.053
...when Napoleon and later Hitler...

01:26.155 --> 01:29.332
...imposed their national driving rules on conquered territory.

01:29.517 --> 01:31.528
Other countries voluntarily switched to the right...

01:31.750 --> 01:34.252
...to align with their neighbors, like Sweden in 1967,...

01:34.533 --> 01:38.557
...or to veer away from their colonial pasts, like Nigeria and Ghana in the 1970s.

01:38.927 --> 01:39.891
And in the US?

01:40.247 --> 01:42.852
Well, America owes its right-sided habit in part...

01:42.953 --> 01:45.343
...to the carts and postilion wagons of its early days.

01:45.642 --> 01:47.573
Driving either from the ground or from horseback,...

01:47.824 --> 01:50.949
...right-handed men preferred to walk or ride on the left side of the horses...

01:51.013 --> 01:53.082
...so they could control the animals with their right hand.

01:53.286 --> 01:55.507
As a result, they drove their wagons to the right...

01:55.594 --> 01:57.164
...so they could be closer to the center of the road...

01:57.251 --> 01:59.437
...to see and steer clear of oncoming traffic.

01:59.664 --> 02:01.788
And that's ultimately the point of driving laws:...

02:01.940 --> 02:06.186
...to keep us safe from the high-speed, two-ton metal projectiles we call cars.
