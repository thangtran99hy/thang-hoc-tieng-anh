Have you ever felt like you could think more clearly after exercising?

00:08.155 --> 00:14.138
According to Justin Rhodes, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Illinois...

00:14.363 --> 00:16.447
...at Urbana-Champaign, exercising helps blood flow to the brain,...

00:16.614 --> 00:17.838
...and throughout the rest of the body.

00:18.249 --> 00:22.199
When our blood flow and blood pressure increase in a healthy way like from exercising,...

00:22.404 --> 00:24.866
...it gives us more oxygen in our blood and more energy.

00:25.374 --> 00:28.313
Or it could be the hippocampus part of the brain that is used for learning...

00:28.405 --> 00:30.213
...and memory is stimulated during a workout.

00:31.053 --> 00:34.136
Research shows that cognitive function improves when a person exercises,...

00:34.386 --> 00:36.033
...even if it's just for 20 minutes.

00:36.889 --> 00:40.834
Older people who do aerobic exercises can actually counteract memory loss,...

00:41.035 --> 00:45.335
...and students who exercise get better test scores than those who aren't as athletic.

00:46.049 --> 00:49.175
According to research from the University of California Los Angeles,...

00:49.621 --> 00:53.879
...exercise increases the brain's growth of neuronal connections, which make learning possible.

00:54.571 --> 00:58.299
Another study that looked at the effects of exercise on the hippocampus part of the brain...

00:58.613 --> 01:01.605
...showed that running reduces the production of stress hormones.
