00:11.667 --> 00:12.195
Thank you.

00:19.943 --> 00:27.197
In the name of God, the most beneficent, the most merciful.

00:29.530 --> 00:36.964
Today, it is an honor for me to be speaking again after a long time.

00:38.570 --> 00:44.079
Being here with such honorable people is a great moment in my life...

00:45.147 --> 00:51.323
...and it is an honor for me that today I am wearing a shawl of Benazir Bhutto Shaheed.

00:55.800 --> 00:58.372
I don't know where to begin my speech.

01:00.331 --> 01:03.113
I don't know what people would be expecting me to say.

01:05.501 --> 01:13.011
But first of all, thank you to God for whom we all are equal...

01:14.228 --> 01:21.438
...and thank you to every person who has prayed for my fast recovery and a new life.

01:24.240 --> 01:28.462
I cannot believe how much love people have shown me.

01:31.457 --> 01:36.557
I have received thousands of good wish cards and gifts from all over the world.

01:38.013 --> 01:39.760
Thank you to all of them.

01:41.033 --> 01:46.744
Thank you to the children whose innocent words encouraged me.

01:47.582 --> 01:52.095
Thank you to my elders whose prayers strengthened me.

01:53.618 --> 02:04.573
Dear brothers and sisters, do remember one thing: "Malala Day" is not my day.

02:07.027 --> 02:15.071
Today is the day of every woman, every boy and every girl...

02:16.683 --> 02:19.416
...who have raised their voice for their rights.

02:22.461 --> 02:27.715
There are hundreds of human rights activists and social workers...

02:28.839 --> 02:31.187
...who are not only speaking for their rights,...

02:32.401 --> 02:39.845
...but who are struggling to achieve their goal of peace, education and equality.

02:42.111 --> 02:47.324
Thousands of people have been killed by the terrorists and millions have been injured.

02:48.071 --> 02:49.299
I'm just one of them.

02:52.685 --> 02:54.047
So here I stand.

02:55.775 --> 02:59.042
So here I stand, one girl among many.

03:01.171 --> 03:07.905
I speak not for myself, but so those without a voice can be heard.

03:10.955 --> 03:13.622
Those who have fought for their rights.

03:16.116 --> 03:18.852
Their right to live in peace.

03:20.405 --> 03:24.252
Their right to be treated with dignity.

03:25.731 --> 03:29.033
Their right to equality of opportunity.

03:30.097 --> 03:32.145
Their right to be educated.

03:34.247 --> 03:45.055
Dear friends, on the 9th of October 2012, the Taliban shot me on the left side of my forehead.

03:46.699 --> 03:48.169
They shot my friends, too.

03:50.271 --> 03:57.514
They thought that the bullets would silence us, but they failed.

04:00.253 --> 04:04.136
And out of that silence came thousands of voices.

04:05.624 --> 04:10.438
The terrorists thought that they would change my aims and stop my ambitions.

04:11.242 --> 04:19.617
But nothing changed in my life except this: weakness, fear and hopelessness died.

04:20.183 --> 04:23.485
Strength, power and courage were born.
