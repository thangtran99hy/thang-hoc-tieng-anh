Thank you for asking.

00:23.877 --> 00:28.118
Amanda, it's our first lesson, so can you tell me about yourself?

00:28.747 --> 00:29.389
Okay.

00:29.813 --> 00:33.613
My name is Amanda and I'm 29 years old.

Do you have a hobby?

That's great.

00:39.995 --> 00:41.731
Can you recommend me a good book?

00:42.307 --> 00:42.815
Sure.

00:43.319 --> 00:45.139
What about the novel, "Perfume"?

00:45.809 --> 00:46.475
Is it good?

00:46.947 --> 00:48.266
I wanted to read it, too.

00:48.557 --> 00:49.904
Oh, believe me.

00:50.185 --> 00:51.656
You will just love it.

00:52.107 --> 00:53.591
Do you like watching movies?

00:53.793 --> 00:54.651
Of course!

00:55.095 --> 00:57.287
I go to the movies every weekend.

00:57.871 --> 00:58.404
Good.

00:58.758 --> 01:00.793
Let me recommend you a movie this time.
