00:01.981 --> 00:08.476
In the year 2030, 58% of adults will be overweight according to statistics.

00:10.918 --> 00:14.752
Thanks to lifts, escalators, cars, chairs, computers,...

00:15.067 --> 00:17.177
...we will be more and more sedentary.

00:20.935 --> 00:25.003
By the year 2030, 60% of the world's population will live in cities...

00:28.002 --> 00:31.351
...and we'll spend most of our time sitting or lying down.

00:35.741 --> 00:41.159
In spite of all this, we will still feel stressed and 20% will have trouble sleeping.

00:46.224 --> 00:50.217
By that year, 60% of all children are likely not to have seen a cow...

00:50.749 --> 00:53.189
...and bad dietary habits will continue to increase.

00:56.028 --> 01:01.766
This is what our world will be like in the year 2030 according to statistics.

01:05.087 --> 01:10.987
But the only real statistic is that 100% of statistics are made by us...

01:13.465 --> 01:15.719
...and we are going to change them.

01:19.710 --> 01:21.095
What if we stand up?
