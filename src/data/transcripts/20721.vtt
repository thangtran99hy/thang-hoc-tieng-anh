00:01.253 --> 00:04.905
By now, you've probably heard that pearls start off as a foreign granule of something,...

00:05.021 --> 00:09.310
...and through time and the magic of certain mollusks become perfectly polished pearls.

00:09.907 --> 00:12.000
Some then also come out perfectly round.

00:12.772 --> 00:17.097
It's been thought that the perfectly spherical specimens are a result of natural rotation,...

00:17.375 --> 00:20.759
...but the missing link in the process was exactly how they were rotating.

00:21.526 --> 00:23.709
Round and oblong pearls start the same way.

00:24.075 --> 00:26.365
When a clam, oyster or mussel detects an intruder,...

00:26.439 --> 00:29.988
...its defense mechanism is activated and the intruder is coated with nacre,...

00:30.203 --> 00:33.109
...a crystalline substance also known as mother-of-pearl.

00:33.777 --> 00:37.158
As the substance builds, it creates terraces around the growing object.

00:37.388 --> 00:40.044
As the terraces build up, they release a warm energy.

00:40.696 --> 00:45.001
Meanwhile, the water molecules in the surrounding liquid drop on the little pearl steps...

00:45.073 --> 00:47.094
...and build up some thermal energy of their own.

00:47.902 --> 00:50.025
A small force in the opposite direction is created,...

00:50.147 --> 00:52.591
...and the pearl begins to spin ever so slowly.

00:53.369 --> 00:56.324
When the crystallization process stops, so does the rotating.

00:57.112 --> 00:59.250
Naturally round pearls are incredibly rare.

00:59.639 --> 01:01.253
Most pearls on the market are cultured;...

01:01.530 --> 01:04.514
...they're still from mollusks, but the process has been manipulated.
