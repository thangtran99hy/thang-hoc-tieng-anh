00:01.161 --> 00:04.283
Welcome to "This is Madness:..."

00:04.476 --> 00:06.751
"...The Star Wars Character Tournament."

00:07.209 --> 00:13.567
We would be honored if you would join us in "This is Madness!"

00:13.743 --> 00:17.621
You will be presented with matchups featuring heroes on the light side...

00:17.801 --> 00:22.277
...and quote, unquote "villains" on the dark side.

00:22.615 --> 00:27.673
You don't know the power of the... sorry where was I?

00:28.056 --> 00:30.135
Oh yes, the tournament.

00:30.589 --> 00:34.638
You must vote for your favorite hero or villain in each matchup.

00:35.324 --> 00:39.017
Whoever receives the most votes will advance in the tournament...

00:39.237 --> 00:45.093
...until he or she is crowned champion of "This is Madness!"

00:45.474 --> 00:47.021
Now for my pitch.

00:49.565 --> 00:55.431
With your backing, I will win this competition and crush all who stand in my way.

00:55.935 --> 01:00.835
Together, we will unleash the power of the dark side...

01:01.119 --> 01:08.575
...and I will have bragging rights over both Obi-Wan and the emperor which is pretty awesome.

01:09.259 --> 01:16.676
So, as much as I hate democracy, vote now, vote often and vote Vader.

01:17.265 --> 01:19.509
It is the only way.
