Bangkok, Thailand is the new tourist go-to destination,...

00:05.449 --> 00:08.340
...edging out London, last year's most popular place on Earth.

00:09.081 --> 00:12.513
That's according to MasterCard's Global Destination Cities Index.

00:12.714 --> 00:14.254
The report is now on its third year.

00:15.041 --> 00:16.574
One reason Bangkok is on top...

00:16.730 --> 00:18.601
...is that tourism is gaining popularity...

00:18.672 --> 00:20.795
...among the upper middle class in Southeast Asia...

00:20.926 --> 00:22.508
...and travelers like to keep it local.

00:23.217 --> 00:25.098
There are also fun things to see and do,...

00:25.231 --> 00:29.024
...and it's not all stunning temple after stunning temple and breathtaking architecture.

00:29.791 --> 00:32.892
There's more shopping in Bangkok than most humans could physically endure,...

00:33.019 --> 00:35.631
...including floating food sellers and an outdoor market...

00:35.722 --> 00:37.352
...with over 8,000 stalls.

00:38.044 --> 00:41.913
Other eastern destinations in the top ten are Singapore, Istanbul,...

00:42.041 --> 00:44.745
...Dubai, Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong.

00:45.494 --> 00:49.453
Tokyo didn't make the top tier, but people who go there spend way more money,...

00:49.700 --> 00:52.989
...the average being almost 2,200 dollars per tourist.

00:53.785 --> 00:57.433
New York City is the world's favorite place to blow through some cash, though.

00:58.013 --> 01:02.501
This year, its visitors are expected to spend 18.6 billion dollars,...

01:02.699 --> 01:04.462
...more than any other destination.
