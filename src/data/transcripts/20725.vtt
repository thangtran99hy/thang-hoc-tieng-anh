Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, has some mesmerizing natural sights.

00:05.330 --> 00:08.167
In addition to the beaches, hiking trails and mountains,...

00:08.351 --> 00:10.743
...there's a man-made attraction that shouldn't be missed.

00:11.456 --> 00:15.161
The Escadaria Selaron is a set of stunning outdoor steps...

00:15.242 --> 00:16.835
...comprised of colorful tiles.

00:17.289 --> 00:19.749
Created by the Chilean artist Jorge Selaron,...

00:19.922 --> 00:22.553
...he began renovating the stairs in 1990...

00:22.650 --> 00:25.470
...and finally completed the work over 20 years later.

00:26.193 --> 00:29.797
The 250 steps are in front of what used to be Selaron's house.

00:30.452 --> 00:33.801
It began as a sort of hobby, since painting was his first priority,...

00:34.056 --> 00:37.129
...but the tile stair project soon took over as his main interest.

00:37.681 --> 00:40.435
Monetary funds were a major issue with the project.

00:41.245 --> 00:43.563
Selaron didn't have any assistance from the city.

00:44.216 --> 00:46.957
He began collecting old bathtubs and using planters.

00:47.460 --> 00:50.577
Over time, neighbors and residents began donating tiles,...

00:50.675 --> 00:52.779
...which represent cultures from around the world.

00:53.476 --> 00:55.591
Eventually, the vibrant steps were completed,...

00:55.736 --> 00:59.494
...covered in blue, green, yellow and red tiles and ceramics.

00:59.951 --> 01:01.179
Even mirrors were added.

01:01.940 --> 01:06.220
More than 2,000 tiles from over 60 different countries were used on the stairs.

01:06.719 --> 01:08.971
Next time you happen to be in Rio de Janeiro,...

01:09.142 --> 01:12.603
...be sure to check out these steps, along with the city's stunning landscape.
