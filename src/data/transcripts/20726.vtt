Life is a tomato right off the vine.

00:07.051 --> 00:10.079
With the popularity of tomato-based dishes throughout parts of Europe,...

00:10.387 --> 00:14.493
...one would imagine it's enjoyed a long, celebrated history across the continent...

00:14.777 --> 00:16.716
...at very least, in Spain and Italy.

00:17.454 --> 00:19.977
That would be no and primarily for two reasons.

00:20.627 --> 00:23.985
One is that the tomato didn't even get there until the early 1500s.

00:24.279 --> 00:27.092
It finally arrived thanks to some conquistadors,...

00:27.341 --> 00:30.829
...people can't agree on which ones who brought it back from Mesoamerica.

00:31.568 --> 00:34.911
Some European gardeners dabbled with them for ornamental purposes,...

00:35.058 --> 00:37.318
...but foodwise they weren't a popular item.

00:38.110 --> 00:39.893
The second is the hit taken to their image...

00:39.996 --> 00:45.092
...because of their perceived involvement in the deaths of upper class Europeans by the late 1700s.

00:45.415 --> 00:47.611
Even though history later cleared its reputation,...

00:47.880 --> 00:51.419
...for a long time it was blamed when lead poisoning was actually the culprit.

00:51.720 --> 00:54.411
The tomato's acid leached lead from their pewter plates...

00:54.591 --> 00:57.095
...and it ended up being consumed in dangerous quantities.

00:58.055 --> 01:00.179
The Italians were among the first to accept it,...

01:00.369 --> 01:02.106
...as it grew so well in their climate.

01:02.914 --> 01:07.751
The world didn't follow suit until the pizza was invented in Naples in mid to late 1800s.

01:08.549 --> 01:11.064
By the 20th century its time had finally come...

01:11.146 --> 01:14.180
...and it became a staple in soups, sauces, and salads.
