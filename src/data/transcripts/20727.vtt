00:02.453 --> 00:05.267
The Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters haven't budged...

00:05.377 --> 00:09.097
...from their demand that ousted President Muhammad Morsi be reinstated.

00:09.407 --> 00:12.571
Even though Egypt's interim leadership has forged ahead...

00:12.687 --> 00:17.373
...by nominating a new prime minister and announcing a timetable for elections.

00:18.351 --> 00:23.330
Clashes between the Brotherhood and the military as well as those supporting Mr. Morsi's ouster...

00:23.419 --> 00:26.286
...have left dozens dead and many more injured.

00:26.799 --> 00:31.939
Reconciliation is only possible if Mr. Morsi is reinstated as President...

00:32.198 --> 00:35.679
...says senior Brotherhood member Abdel-Rahman El-Barr.

00:39.622 --> 00:42.771
What is acceptable is that legitimacy is restored once again,...

00:42.873 --> 00:45.243
...and the legitimately elected president returns,...

00:45.313 --> 00:49.400
...and matters proceed once again according to the constitution and Egyptian law.

00:49.633 --> 00:52.518
In this case, it is possible to consider reconciliation...

00:52.599 --> 00:55.577
...and in this condition it will be possible to move forward.

00:55.752 --> 00:58.213
And this is the logical solution to the crisis.

00:59.939 --> 01:03.987
Soldiers are still positioned around Cairo's most sensitive buildings.

01:04.452 --> 01:09.054
The military would be ready to return them to their barracks when security improves,...

01:09.381 --> 01:12.925
...says analyst and retired general Sameh Seif Elyazal.

01:13.081 --> 01:15.567
It's their choice, it's the choice of the Muslim Brotherhood now.

01:15.660 --> 01:21.405
If they want to join the new political forces in Egypt or even as an opposition group, no problem at all.

01:21.703 --> 01:25.334
Or they will stay carrying weapons, carrying Kalashnikovs, and killing people.

01:25.521 --> 01:26.049
It's up to them.

01:27.793 --> 01:33.021
The military says it ousted President Morsi because millions rose up to demand his departure...

01:33.242 --> 01:38.122
...after he failed to fix the country's struggling economy and unify the country.

01:39.195 --> 01:46.189
Now, says Mahmoud Badr, a founder of the Tamarod Campaign that sparked the civilian uprising, the people are united.

01:50.394 --> 01:54.947
It is impossible that the big and great Egypt, and anyone concerned about its stability,...

01:55.034 --> 01:58.446
...would allow a group of terrorists to govern us by force or by threats.

01:58.711 --> 02:00.966
We will not allow terrorism to rule us.

02:01.129 --> 02:04.319
Egypt overcame terrorism before and will do so again,...

02:04.535 --> 02:07.944
...even if they try to rule us by force, regardless of who it is.

02:08.078 --> 02:14.783
However, reports on Tuesday said Tamarod had dismissed the constitutional changes proposed by the interim leadership.
