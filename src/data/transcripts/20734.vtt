The Pamplona Bull Run attracts up to a million thrill seekers each year from all over the world,...

00:18.192 --> 00:23.219
...hoping to combine the heavy-duty adrenaline fix with a hint of traditional Spanish culture.

00:24.018 --> 00:28.148
But the reality of the Pamplona Bull Run is a far cry from the apparent fun...

00:28.291 --> 00:32.241
...and frolics so often portrayed by tour operators and in the media.

00:32.935 --> 00:38.176
Behind the festivities, there is a darker side, involving hideous animal cruelty.

00:43.569 --> 00:45.892
The origins of the Pamplona Bull Run aren't clear,...

00:46.207 --> 00:48.226
...but it may have begun in the 19th century...

00:48.659 --> 00:52.774
...when local residents would run alongside the bulls as they were herded through the streets.

00:54.019 --> 00:57.768
These days, however, the bull run has morphed into a huge tourist trap,...

00:58.387 --> 01:01.911
...bearing absolutely no resemblance to traditional Spanish culture.

01:02.773 --> 01:06.487
Many of the tourists are lured there by cheap package holiday deals...

01:06.935 --> 01:09.801
...which promote the bull runners a boozy holiday with a difference.
