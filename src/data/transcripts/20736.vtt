There are many common mistakes made when wearing heels, such as wobbly ankles,...

00:16.041 --> 00:17.073
...stiff knees,...

00:22.319 --> 00:24.066
...and gripping of the thighs.

00:27.367 --> 00:29.842
Here are some tips to avoid those mistakes.

00:30.184 --> 00:33.936
First of all, stand up straight, with your chest reaching to the sky.

00:34.444 --> 00:36.129
This will give the impression of confidence,...

00:36.273 --> 00:39.465
...as well as counterbalance the weight shift from wearing heels.

00:40.062 --> 00:42.661
Secondly, engage the lower abs.

00:43.059 --> 00:46.518
This will activate the lower back, which is helpful for stabilization.

00:47.131 --> 00:50.262
And finally, relax through the hips and knees.

00:50.637 --> 00:52.477
This will help you glide through the foot.

00:53.533 --> 00:54.743
Alright, there you go.

00:55.065 --> 00:55.560
That's it.

00:56.809 --> 01:01.450
Chest up, lower abs in and relax through those hips and knees.

01:01.875 --> 01:04.843
In no time at all, you'll be walking sexy and sassy.
