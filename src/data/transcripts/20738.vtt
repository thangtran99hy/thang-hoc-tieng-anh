Oh, it says here you guys are from Foster Farms.

00:02.537 --> 00:04.829
Raised right here in sunny California.

00:05.134 --> 00:08.359
Sorry, my friend here was just looking for some corn, like in Foster Farms.

00:08.422 --> 00:09.073
Hey, Shenisse.

00:09.270 --> 00:10.308
Hey, baby.

00:10.520 --> 00:13.328
You guys wouldn't happen to have your American Humane certification?

00:14.009 --> 00:16.105
...no nasty chemicals or nothing.

00:16.443 --> 00:20.222
Then you won't mind taking a little test for me then, would you?

00:23.291 --> 00:23.707
Gotta go.

00:23.910 --> 00:25.908
Foster Farms, no added hormones or steroids.

00:26.045 --> 00:28.571
Raised right and certified by the American Humane Association.

00:28.671 --> 00:30.120
Always natural, always fresh.
