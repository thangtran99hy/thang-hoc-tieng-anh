00:06.303 --> 00:19.104
I would like to express firstly my admiration for a great man, Nelson Mandela.

00:19.892 --> 00:25.095
You're an example to us all of perseverance, forgiveness, strength, wisdom and grace.

00:25.417 --> 00:31.936
Never before in history was one human being so universally acknowledged in his lifetime...

00:32.426 --> 00:37.993
...as the embodiment of magnanimity and reconciliation as Nelson Mandela.

00:38.194 --> 00:41.693
We have all equally been awed by his dedication to others...

00:43.097 --> 00:45.845
...and by his inspiration to serve as he did.

00:46.716 --> 00:49.398
We're here to build a more just and peaceful world.

01:18.415 --> 01:22.493
Please, please, please, on the 18th of July let's stand together.

01:22.829 --> 01:25.546
Give 67 minutes of your time to do what you can.

01:25.739 --> 01:31.983
I would like to encourage everyone to do something worthy for someone else on Mandela Day.

01:32.507 --> 01:35.019
I will also be giving my 67 minutes...

01:35.431 --> 01:38.892
...to make the world a better place one small step at a time.

01:39.310 --> 01:42.298
I ask you to celebrate by following his example...

01:43.138 --> 01:49.237
...by doing your best to help others with a full, happy, grateful heart.

01:49.749 --> 01:50.519
Take action.

01:51.669 --> 01:52.887
Inspire change.

01:53.577 --> 01:55.775
Make every day Mandela Day.

01:56.398 --> 01:58.715
We're made for one another.

01:59.649 --> 02:03.332
Together, we can create a better world.

02:03.862 --> 02:05.639
Thank you for your example, Madiba.
