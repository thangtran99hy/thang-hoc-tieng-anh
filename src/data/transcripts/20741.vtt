On behalf of the American people, including Muslim communities in all 50 States,...

00:04.851 --> 00:08.319
...I want to extend best wishes to Muslims in America and around the world.

00:08.949 --> 00:09.840
Ramadan Kareem.

00:10.865 --> 00:13.295
Ramadan is the month in which Muslims believe...

00:13.373 --> 00:15.545
...the Koran was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad,...

00:16.153 --> 00:18.617
...beginning with a simple word, iqra.

00:19.492 --> 00:21.570
It is therefore a time when Muslims reflect...

00:21.683 --> 00:23.935
...upon the wisdom and guidance that comes with faith,...

00:24.404 --> 00:28.006
...and the responsibility that human beings have to one another and to God.

00:29.209 --> 00:30.831
Like many people of different faiths...

00:30.897 --> 00:33.357
...who have seen Ramadan through our communities and families,...

00:33.628 --> 00:38.144
...I know this to be a festive time, a time when families gather and meals are shared;...

00:38.900 --> 00:42.664
...but I also know that Ramadan is a time of intense devotion and reflection,...

00:43.272 --> 00:48.255
...a time when Muslims fast during the day and perform tarawih prayers at night,...

00:48.667 --> 00:51.932
...reciting and listening to the entire Koran over the course of the month.

00:52.880 --> 00:56.170
These rituals remind us of the principles that we hold in common,...

00:56.711 --> 00:59.519
...and Islam's role in advancing justice, progress,...

00:59.894 --> 01:02.408
...tolerance, and the dignity of all human beings.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.746
For instance, fasting is a concept shared by many faiths,...

01:06.121 --> 01:07.497
...including my own Christian faith,...

01:07.984 --> 01:10.039
...as a way to bring people closer to God...

01:10.588 --> 01:13.704
...and to those among us who cannot take their next meal for granted.

01:14.431 --> 01:16.491
And the support that Muslims provide to others...

01:16.861 --> 01:21.458
...recalls our responsibility to advance opportunity and prosperity for people everywhere.

01:22.095 --> 01:25.183
...for all of us must remember that the world we want to build...

01:25.675 --> 01:27.399
...and the changes that we want to make...

01:27.875 --> 01:30.979
...must begin in our own hearts and our own communities.

01:31.813 --> 01:34.757
This summer, people across America have served in their communities:...

01:35.164 --> 01:37.237
...educating children, caring for the sick,...

01:37.570 --> 01:40.694
...and extending a hand to those who have fallen on hard times.

01:41.503 --> 01:44.871
Faith-based organizations, including many Islamic organizations,...

01:45.169 --> 01:48.226
...have been at the forefront in participating in this summer of service.

01:48.817 --> 01:52.451
And in these challenging times, this is a spirit of responsibility...

01:52.783 --> 01:55.192
...that we must sustain in the months and years to come.

01:55.755 --> 01:57.044
Beyond America's borders,...

01:57.249 --> 02:00.530
...we're also committed to keeping our responsibility to build a world...

02:00.840 --> 02:02.390
...that is more peaceful and secure.

02:03.136 --> 02:05.796
That's why we're responsibly ending the war in Iraq.

02:06.323 --> 02:08.753
That's why we are isolating violent extremists...

02:08.995 --> 02:12.266
...while empowering the people in places like Afghanistan and Pakistan.

02:13.001 --> 02:17.493
And that is why we strongly and actively support a two-state solution...

02:17.648 --> 02:22.625
...that recognizes the rights of Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security.

02:23.469 --> 02:27.425
That's also why America will always stand for the universal rights of all people...

02:27.600 --> 02:32.307
...to speak their mind, practice their religion, contribute fully to their society,...

02:32.653 --> 02:34.690
...and to have confidence in the rule of law.
