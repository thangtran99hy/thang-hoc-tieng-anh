Parkour is spreading so fast,...

00:02.487 --> 00:04.799
...it has reached out to nearly every country in the world.

00:06.157 --> 00:09.006
And as a result of this, different styles are popping up everywhere.

00:09.505 --> 00:12.713
You know, I studied martial arts and media where I've met some absolute geniuses:...

00:12.871 --> 00:17.061
...Parkour athletes who are studying biochemistry, designing new cures for cancer,...

00:17.313 --> 00:23.035
...athletes who are studying philosophy, business studies, media; actors, stuntmen, even politics.

00:23.123 --> 00:25.199
You know, parkour athletes who wanna fight the system.

00:28.309 --> 00:29.373
Some people are here to compete.

00:29.444 --> 00:31.029
Some people are here to express themselves.

00:31.267 --> 00:34.639
Some people are here to just surround themselves with other parkour athletes...

00:34.721 --> 00:37.831
...and gain our experience, and that's where I really like to be.

00:37.904 --> 00:44.565
The fact that Red Bull Art of Motion is compact with so many athletes with amazing abilities...

00:44.682 --> 00:47.377
...is that being around them influences your style again.

00:49.921 --> 00:52.719
You can't learn parkour by just watching YouTube videos.

00:53.193 --> 00:56.878
The fastest way, it seems, is to surround yourself with other parkour athletes.

00:58.127 --> 01:01.993
But remember one thing: don't listen to what any of the guys say, don't listen to what anyone else says.

01:02.431 --> 01:04.219
Just be inspired to figure it out for yourself.

01:07.495 --> 01:08.774
What's next for Ryan Doyle?

01:09.347 --> 01:12.774
I really don't know what the future has in store for me and I think that's the best part.

01:13.168 --> 01:14.009
I'd rather not know.

01:14.847 --> 01:15.859
It's just an adventure.
