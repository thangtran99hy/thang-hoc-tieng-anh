00:07.245 --> 00:09.441
We carry our phones wherever we go.

00:11.926 --> 00:14.714
They're with us almost every second of the day.

00:17.505 --> 00:21.714
We reach for them when we have a free moment or we're curious.

00:22.810 --> 00:27.105
More than anything, we use our phones to connect with the people we care about.

00:30.916 --> 00:32.045
This is Facebook Home.

00:34.520 --> 00:37.887
From the moment you turn on your phone, you see what friends are sharing.

00:39.183 --> 00:42.591
Your latest messages, calls, and updates are right up front.

00:45.273 --> 00:49.231
And you can keep chatting from any app, so no matter what you're doing,...

00:49.699 --> 00:51.781
...your friends are always right there with you.

00:55.309 --> 00:55.854
Home.

00:56.850 --> 00:58.955
A whole new experience for your phone.
