Introducing Photo Filters.

00:03.607 --> 00:06.751
Ah, San Francisco: Land of a million vacation photos.

00:07.104 --> 00:07.765
And here's Phil!

00:08.049 --> 00:11.624
Phil has filled his phone with photos and is using Twitter's photo editor to tweet them out.

00:12.109 --> 00:12.900
Let's learn how.

00:13.333 --> 00:15.773
While composing a tweet, Phil taps on the camera icon...

00:15.853 --> 00:18.150
...and then navigates to the photo he would like to use.

00:18.823 --> 00:19.604
That's the one!

00:20.009 --> 00:21.175
And now he's ready to edit.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.429
As you can see, there are three icons at the bottom.

00:23.625 --> 00:26.481
The first one automatically enhances your image for a quick fix.

00:27.179 --> 00:29.095
The icon on the right allows you to crop the image,...

00:30.049 --> 00:32.947
...move and scale your photo and select either original or square.

00:35.235 --> 00:38.565
Finally, clicking the center option allows you to choose a filter for your photo.

00:39.105 --> 00:42.759
Tap one of the filters to see it up close or swipe the image to try another.

00:43.140 --> 00:43.877
There we go!

00:44.367 --> 00:46.067
Phil's finished, so he clicks "Done",...

00:46.357 --> 00:48.501
...and he's ready to send his tweet and share the photo.

00:49.132 --> 00:51.924
All of his fabulous filtered photos show up on his home timeline,...

00:52.520 --> 00:54.402
...wonderful memories from the City by the Bay.

00:55.908 --> 01:00.278
We here at Twitter hope that you enjoy these new features, and as always, happy tweeting!
