For most people, Venice is a must-see destination.

00:04.660 --> 00:09.580
To be here on this unique island amid all this culture and history is truly a wonder.

00:09.918 --> 00:15.099
But with its popularity, St. Mark's Square in midday can come with overwhelming crowds.

00:15.943 --> 00:18.841
It'll take an hour for these folks to get into the church.

00:19.555 --> 00:24.249
With so many people traveling these days, if you're not on the ball, crowds can be a real problem.

00:26.789 --> 00:28.623
To me, there are two kinds of travelers:...

00:28.762 --> 00:33.838
...those who waste valuable time waiting in long lines like this and smarter travelers who don't.

00:35.175 --> 00:38.623
Most lines you see, like this one at the Uffizi gallery in Florence,...

00:38.887 --> 00:40.533
...are not people waiting to get in.

00:41.461 --> 00:43.347
They are waiting to buy tickets to get in.

00:43.799 --> 00:45.771
But there are other ways to get tickets.

00:46.361 --> 00:50.577
For example, these people at the Louvre in Paris could avoid this notorious line...

00:50.807 --> 00:55.652
...if they simply bought the city museum pass, which lets you go directly through the turnstile.

00:56.669 --> 01:00.420
You can also make reservations in places like Rome's Borghese gallery...

01:00.521 --> 01:03.851
...to get directly into crowded sites by phone or on the Web.

01:04.483 --> 01:07.434
Or you can arrange your schedule to avoid crowds altogether.

01:08.221 --> 01:13.410
The ancient Pantheon is mobbed through the day but literally all yours early or late.
