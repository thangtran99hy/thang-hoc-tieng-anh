The year 2013 also promises to see triple-digit year-on-year growth of this trend.

00:20.391 --> 00:24.047
Google India and TNS Australia undertook a study...

00:28.073 --> 00:31.845

00:32.540 --> 00:34.487
Validating the growth in trends,...

...nine out of ten e-commerce buyers intend to spend more on online shopping this year.

00:40.927 --> 00:46.071
The areas that would contribute to growth include a greater contribution from non-metros.
