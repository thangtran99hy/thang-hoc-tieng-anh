00:08.879 --> 00:09.903
Being here in Dublin,...

00:10.411 --> 00:11.417
...the people are so nice.

00:11.530 --> 00:13.538
You literally can't stop for more than ten seconds...

00:13.628 --> 00:14.923
...without someone coming over and saying,...

00:15.219 --> 00:17.199
..."Do you need help? Where are you going? What do you need? Anything!"

00:27.739 --> 00:30.457
It's even more green than I expected and it's beautiful.

00:30.923 --> 00:32.694
We're in Saint Patrick's Cathedral.

00:32.921 --> 00:36.929
There's so much to see in here, from the stained glass to the statues...

00:37.039 --> 00:38.949
...or just the floors and the ceiling itself.

00:46.134 --> 00:47.681
That's my first bite of fish and it was good!

00:47.834 --> 00:50.594
It was crazy to leave the city of Dublin for a day trip,...

00:50.692 --> 00:54.842
...and suddenly being in a countryside where it's breathtakingly beautiful.

00:55.191 --> 00:57.686
I think it's, overall, a very eye-opening experience...

00:57.773 --> 00:59.911
...to have a tour guide there to tell you about everything...

01:00.020 --> 01:02.392
...rather than walking around and having to figure it out by yourself.

01:02.618 --> 01:03.969
We're here at Trinity College right now.

01:04.075 --> 01:05.567
It's a gorgeous campus.

01:05.664 --> 01:09.179
It's older than the entirety of United States, which is pretty remarkable.

01:11.194 --> 01:12.591
The Irish dinner was so great,...

01:12.667 --> 01:15.313
...and it was just a night of laughing and having fun...

01:15.385 --> 01:17.818
...and watching great traditional music.

01:18.051 --> 01:21.348
Being loud and being crazy just made us all bond even more,...

01:21.431 --> 01:22.303
...and it was a great time.
