Zombies don't just exist in science fiction movies and music videos.

00:10.004 --> 00:13.728
They're for real and we can find them all over the animal kingdom.

00:14.048 --> 00:16.865
It's not because animals have come back from the dead.

00:17.159 --> 00:22.031
It's because parasites have figured out how to control the behavior of their animal hosts.

00:22.449 --> 00:26.451
For example, a parasitic fly lays eggs on a honeybee's body.

00:26.773 --> 00:32.730
The beset bee leaves the hive one night, then crawls in zombie-like circles before dying.

00:33.158 --> 00:37.243
The fly larvae hatch from the bee's body to seek their own victims.

00:37.850 --> 00:41.789
Then, there's the parasitic hairworm that lives inside crickets.

00:42.937 --> 00:47.541
Crickets can't swim, but the worm forces the cricket to jump into water...

00:47.628 --> 00:50.511
...when it's ready to emerge and start its next phase of life.

00:51.369 --> 00:55.053
And then there's the fungus that can infect tropical tree-dwelling ants.

00:56.184 --> 00:58.167
When the ants are infected by the fungus,...

00:58.246 --> 01:01.128
...they crawl out to a spot on the tree where the fungus can thrive.

01:01.529 --> 01:05.459
Then the fungus kills the ant and eats its body from the inside out,...

01:05.702 --> 01:08.433
...sprouting spores from the ant's head.

01:09.454 --> 01:11.387
Other ants pick up these spores.

01:11.647 --> 01:13.458
Now they're doomed as well.

01:14.353 --> 01:16.839
So how do these dastardly parasites do it?

01:17.174 --> 01:23.624
Scientists think these parasites can control or mimic molecules in the animals' brains that influence behavior.

01:23.805 --> 01:28.062
And no, humans are not immune to getting zombified by parasites.

01:28.561 --> 01:35.760
Researchers think the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii might actually change people's personalities,...

01:36.017 --> 01:38.810
...making them more sociable but also reckless.

01:39.089 --> 01:44.287
It's thought that the parasite alters hormone levels and boosts dopamine, making us feel good.

01:44.469 --> 01:51.666
More than 22% of Americans might be infected with Toxoplasma gondii which we catch from house cats.

01:53.225 --> 01:58.261
