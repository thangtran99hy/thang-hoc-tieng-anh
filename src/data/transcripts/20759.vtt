00:05.365 --> 00:06.683
How long can you hold your breath?

00:07.044 --> 00:09.540
Science says without training, it's gonna be about a minute.

00:09.726 --> 00:10.528
Let's give it a shot.

00:11.725 --> 00:15.506
Some people such as free divers can hold their breath for a few minutes with training.

00:15.705 --> 00:17.494
But scientists have no idea why this is.

00:17.584 --> 00:23.287
Or why most of us gasp for air long before we turn blue in the face or pass out.

00:23.573 --> 00:26.496
In theory, we should be fine holding our breath for much longer.

00:26.841 --> 00:30.029
After all, our lungs can hold about four minutes' worth of air.

00:30.489 --> 00:33.234
But at some point, our body forces us to inhale.

00:33.697 --> 00:36.254
Researchers call this the "breakpoint".

00:37.249 --> 00:39.509
How does our body force this breakpoint?

00:39.843 --> 00:44.843
Maybe, a sensor in our arteries tells our brain that our blood is getting low on oxygen.

00:45.376 --> 00:50.207
Or perhaps, our lungs are warning us they're low on air and forcing us to inhale.

00:50.684 --> 00:53.075
Science has rejected both of these theories.

00:53.400 --> 00:57.817
We now think it's actually our diaphragm signaling our body to take a breath.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.630
Test this out yourself.

01:00.082 --> 01:03.266
Next time you hold your breath and you're about to burst,...

01:03.947 --> 01:06.769
...try relaxing your diaphragm with a partial exhale.

01:07.814 --> 01:10.539
This little trick should help delay your personal breakpoint.

01:12.233 --> 01:16.703
Okay, 52 seconds; that's obviously not gonna break any records.
