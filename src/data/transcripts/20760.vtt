Hi everyone, I'm Shay Mitchell and today, I'm here shooting for People Magazine's shoot.

00:09.602 --> 00:14.284
What makes me feel most beautiful is probably when I get home from the gym,...

00:15.241 --> 00:16.847
...or any form of workout actually.

00:16.993 --> 00:20.383
It clears up my mind, and my body feels good and strong,...

00:21.370 --> 00:23.653
...and there's just a different kind of confidence and happiness.

00:24.878 --> 00:26.877
One of my favorite beauty tips is from my mom...

00:27.130 --> 00:30.015
...and her thing to me was always moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.

00:30.147 --> 00:32.361
And then, she added in the coconut oil.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.251
And my mom being from the Philippines,...

00:34.521 --> 00:37.520
...they use a lot of that over there for their hair and for their skin.

00:37.656 --> 00:40.169
So if you have some coconut oil, that's my beauty trick.

00:40.261 --> 00:41.912
Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.

00:42.791 --> 00:44.219
Working with three other girls,...

00:44.293 --> 00:47.151
...everybody always asks what other tips do you pick out from the other girls.

00:47.631 --> 00:51.671
And even though I play this athletic character on the show, outside of it...

00:52.761 --> 00:54.240
...I'm probably the girliest; no, I am.

00:55.035 --> 00:56.950
I'm always kind of sending out numbers back and forth...

00:57.030 --> 00:59.274
...and I'm like try this person, try this person, I just got my nails done.

00:59.867 --> 01:04.477
I'm kind of the beauty tipster for that, out of our little group.
