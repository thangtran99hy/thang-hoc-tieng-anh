Have you been wondering why you can't sit still and study?

00:09.757 --> 00:12.467
Do you always fall asleep or get distracted by other things?

00:13.005 --> 00:15.419
Well, don't worry because we all do it.

00:16.349 --> 00:18.984
But there are ways to avoid slacking off while studying.

00:19.424 --> 00:21.652
And we will show you how to do that in this video.

00:22.630 --> 00:25.376
First, don't spend too many hours studying straight.

00:26.004 --> 00:28.591
Your mind will become congested and everything will just look boring.

00:29.304 --> 00:33.347
Take regular breaks after each hour or after each task is completed.

00:34.839 --> 00:37.685
Put away distractions like your mobile phone or magazines.

00:38.244 --> 00:40.168
Just try to focus on one thing at a time.

00:42.017 --> 00:43.918
Keep your study environment clean and bright.

00:44.529 --> 00:46.433
Your mind will absorb more information this way.

00:47.141 --> 00:49.701
Also, keep your notes and folders organized.

00:50.248 --> 00:53.074
That way, you wouldn't have to waste your time finding things.

00:54.769 --> 00:57.645
And remember to eat and drink well to give your brain some energy.

00:58.962 --> 01:04.655
Regular walks to the cafeteria or to your kitchen might also help your brain relax.

01:13.158 --> 01:14.707
Another distraction is the environment.

01:15.507 --> 01:20.285
If there are too many people around or if it is too noisy, move to a different place.

01:22.513 --> 01:25.470
Remember to keep track of the time and take your regular breaks.

01:25.983 --> 01:30.927
That way, you will avoid falling asleep or slacking off to do other unproductive things.
