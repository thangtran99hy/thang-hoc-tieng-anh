00:07.236 --> 00:07.900
I'm Brittany.

00:08.045 --> 00:10.653
I'm 18 and I live in Florida in the USA.

00:22.961 --> 00:26.266
Almost every day, I read the latest science news and research advances...

00:26.389 --> 00:29.020
...because it is so exciting to see the breakthroughs being made.

00:30.761 --> 00:33.682
I became fascinated by an article on artificial intelligence,...

00:34.089 --> 00:35.757
...and I decided to learn how to program.

00:36.815 --> 00:40.093
Coding was a real challenge and it took a few attempts to get it to work.

00:41.345 --> 00:44.739
Back when I was little, I really grew to idolize the men and women in scrubs...

00:44.864 --> 00:47.256
...who were using science every day to save lives.

00:48.141 --> 00:52.780
My brother was born premature and we spent a lot of time in the hospital for his first few years.

00:53.815 --> 00:56.945
Then when I was 15, my cousin was diagnosed with breast cancer...

00:57.210 --> 01:00.579
...and I saw firsthand the impact it has on a woman and her family.

01:01.289 --> 01:03.055
I decided I wanted to make a difference...

01:03.170 --> 01:06.370
...by trying to make the experience a little bit better for those involved.

01:06.991 --> 01:10.018
I was able to teach the computer how to diagnose breast cancer...

01:10.181 --> 01:15.419
...by making it think like the brain to detect patterns far too complex for humans to recognize.

01:15.857 --> 01:19.126
This means it could determine if a breast mass is malignant or benign.

01:19.850 --> 01:23.133
It's really important because the least invasive test for breast cancer...

01:23.539 --> 01:25.079
...is also the least conclusive.

01:25.843 --> 01:28.209
Most doctors refuse to use these biopsies.

01:28.493 --> 01:32.659
If they could be used, it could lead to earlier detection and a better process for the patient.

01:33.377 --> 01:37.061
I spent hundreds upon hundreds of hours researching for over two years,...

01:37.521 --> 01:41.129
...creating a neural network tool for doctors to use when analyzing results.

01:41.811 --> 01:45.788
When the application actually diagnosed masses successfully, it was very exciting.

01:46.207 --> 01:49.441
It diagnoses over ninety-nine percent of cancer patients correctly.

01:49.905 --> 01:51.879
And since it is deployed as a cloud service,...

01:52.002 --> 01:54.867
...it has the potential to be accessed by any hospital in the world.

01:55.753 --> 01:59.213
It has been amazing to see how people, including cancer survivors,...

01:59.663 --> 02:02.056
...are responding to my program and its potential.

02:03.383 --> 02:07.067
Cancer touches all of us, and unfortunately, the rates are rising.

02:07.764 --> 02:10.279
Helping find the cure to cancer is a real goal of mine,...

02:10.506 --> 02:14.155
...and one day, I would love to be working on breakthroughs that can save lives.
