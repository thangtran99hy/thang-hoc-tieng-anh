I'm Lauren Hodge.

00:01.780 --> 00:03.990
I live in York, Pennsylvania and I'm 14 years old.

00:07.253 --> 00:08.519
York is a great place to live.

00:09.546 --> 00:11.669
There's a lot of nature and things to do outdoors.

00:11.989 --> 00:13.010
And a lot of exploring.

00:13.867 --> 00:16.435
Maybe that's why I started exploring the world around me.

00:17.355 --> 00:18.678
I play the piano and violin.

00:19.503 --> 00:23.203
Music allows me to challenge myself creatively, and it also inspires my work.

00:28.746 --> 00:30.148
I love problem-solving.

00:30.347 --> 00:32.933
I love asking questions and then working to find the answers,...

00:33.226 --> 00:34.953
...and that's why science is so appealing to me.

00:35.357 --> 00:36.581
It all starts with a question.

00:37.622 --> 00:40.751
Last year, I was sitting in the doctor's office, leafing through a magazine,...

00:40.972 --> 00:44.142
...and I came upon an article about the carcinogens in grilled chicken.

00:44.876 --> 00:48.141
Later that night, my mom was actually grilling chicken, so it got me thinking.

00:48.585 --> 00:52.003
It was like everyday life presented me with a problem, and now I needed to solve it.

00:54.805 --> 00:57.393
So I started wondering about what caused the carcinogens...

00:57.558 --> 00:59.132
...and if there's any way to deal with it.

00:59.994 --> 01:02.456
I thought marinades might provide a practical solution,...

01:02.639 --> 01:05.288
...so I devised a way to test different marinades on chicken...

01:05.540 --> 01:07.415
...and see whether they reduced carcinogens.

01:08.471 --> 01:11.188
After a lot of testing, I found that several marinades...

01:11.357 --> 01:13.664
...did reduce the carcinogenic effects of grilling.

01:15.749 --> 01:19.905
If you can decrease anything dangerous like carcinogens in something normal like chicken,...

01:20.633 --> 01:22.595
...it can really help increase the quality of life for people...

01:22.665 --> 01:24.565
...that aren't really aware of anything dangerous.

01:25.439 --> 01:29.009
Being a winner in the 2011 Google Science Fair opened a lot of doors for me.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.049
It all started with one question.

01:31.877 --> 01:34.708
And I would encourage other kids out there to ask their own questions,...

01:35.162 --> 01:37.442
...and then embark on their journey to find an answer.
