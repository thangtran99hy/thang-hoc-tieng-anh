00:01.995 --> 00:04.293
Browsing eclectic street markets and stalls...

00:04.717 --> 00:07.883
...is an enduring memory of any visit to the world's favorite city.

00:08.724 --> 00:13.474
It is said you can buy almost anything in Paris without ever entering a store.

00:16.469 --> 00:22.269
From the flower growers and booksellers of Saint-Germain to the artists of Boulevard Edgar Quinet,...

00:27.454 --> 00:29.455
...the market culture thrives.

00:30.254 --> 00:32.483
And at the center of it all is food.

00:33.338 --> 00:38.865
The French passion for gastronomy has seen entire streets declared food markets permanently,...

00:39.481 --> 00:41.259
...open only to pedestrian traffic.

00:42.378 --> 00:47.943
One of the most popular amongst Parisians is Rue Cler and Davoli is their favorite shop.

00:55.851 --> 01:00.687
Named after the family who runs it, dropping in to this frantically busy delicatessen...

01:01.090 --> 01:04.680
...is a daily ritual for the locals of the 7th arrondissement.

01:11.436 --> 01:16.651
We're serving the embassy, actors and everybody.

01:17.470 --> 01:22.238
Stephane Davoli is continuing a family tradition that began in Italy.

01:23.051 --> 01:24.799
My god, it's a long, long story.

01:25.268 --> 01:32.976
My grandfather migrated to France and he opened his first shop in the 16th district.

01:33.563 --> 01:38.688
So I'm the fourth generation of the Italian delis in Paris.

01:44.053 --> 01:46.380
The family spends 11 hours a day in the shop...

01:46.993 --> 01:50.156
...preparing, cooking, cleaning and serving customers.

01:52.124 --> 01:56.441
Their reputation guarantees there are always hungry locals to feed.
