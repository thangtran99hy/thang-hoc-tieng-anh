Couchsurfing can bring an element of safety to traveling...

00:07.476 --> 00:09.491
...which some people may not think of immediately.

00:09.801 --> 00:13.508
Your host knows your environment so well in that local area.

00:13.950 --> 00:15.269
They can show you around.

00:15.401 --> 00:16.795
They know where the hospitals are.

00:17.041 --> 00:20.921
Make you aware of which street is safe to go.

00:21.033 --> 00:25.606
You can see things and be exposed to things that are off the beaten trail.

00:26.047 --> 00:29.035
You are surfing to have a different experience.

00:42.377 --> 00:44.148
I've couchsurfed single.

00:44.403 --> 00:47.352
I met my husband through couchsurfing.

00:47.739 --> 00:51.189
I've couchsurfed pregnant and I'm couchsurfing with our toddler now.

00:53.929 --> 00:56.520
I think sometimes we forget how great people are.

01:01.473 --> 01:05.942
We have all the horror stories in the media and you get a little bit protective...

01:06.029 --> 01:07.551
...and worried about the outside world.

01:08.111 --> 01:11.303
But couchsurfing reminds you how great the outside world can be.
