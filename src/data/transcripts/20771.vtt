If you wake up one morning with 1,000 times the strength you had the night before...

00:12.145 --> 00:15.371
...how will you handle delicate day-to-day tasks?

00:15.899 --> 00:18.263
Everything must seem so fragile to you...

00:18.527 --> 00:23.086
...since the scale of your strength has expanded 1,000 times.

00:23.409 --> 00:26.527
You'd have to be very careful when you're shaking someone's hands...

00:26.581 --> 00:30.764
...so you don't end up breaking their bones or crushing everyone you hug.

00:33.198 --> 00:36.602
And using a fork to pick up a piece of broccoli from a Styrofoam plate...

00:36.865 --> 00:41.943
...without driving the fork through the plate is going to be as difficult as brain surgery.

00:43.253 --> 00:44.545
Say the day comes...

00:44.629 --> 00:49.059
...and you get the chance to save a damsel in distress falling from a helicopter.

00:52.578 --> 00:54.767
So you hold out your arms hoping to catch her;...

00:55.083 --> 00:59.143
...seconds later you will find yourself holding her lifeless body.

00:59.677 --> 01:00.446
What happened?

01:00.699 --> 01:05.793
Well, pressure is force divided by area; the smaller the area, the bigger the pressure.

01:06.191 --> 01:09.273
This is why we can lift heavy objects without breaking our skin,...

01:09.551 --> 01:12.573
...but a tiny needle can make us bleed with just a little poke.

01:14.237 --> 01:17.769
The pressure that will be exerted on her body can be calculated by force,...

01:18.151 --> 01:21.881
...divided by the area on the top of your arms that comes in contact with her.

01:22.030 --> 01:23.741
It doesn't matter if your arms are strong enough...

01:23.813 --> 01:25.833
...to catch her body without breaking your bones.

01:26.086 --> 01:29.569
Her spine is not strong enough to be caught by you without being damaged.

01:30.108 --> 01:33.761
Even if you rip off the nearest door to provide a bigger area to catch her with,...

01:36.055 --> 01:38.355
...you still wouldn't be able to save her anyway.

01:40.117 --> 01:44.359
Remember, it's not the fall that kills her, but the sudden stop at the bottom.

01:45.150 --> 01:49.700
Let's say she's falling from a 32-story building, about 300 feet and you are six feet tall,...

01:49.908 --> 01:52.549
...maybe ten feet on your tippytoes with your arms above your head,...

01:52.605 --> 01:55.985
...holding a door in hopes of distributing the pressure across a larger surface area.

01:57.003 --> 02:00.361
But all you're doing is essentially moving the ground up by ten feet.

02:00.837 --> 02:04.294
So she's now falling from 290 feet instead of 300 feet,...

02:04.548 --> 02:08.148
...reaching the speed of a hundred and thirty-seven feet per second just before impact...

02:08.511 --> 02:09.961
...not counting air resistance.

02:10.851 --> 02:15.768
It's the equivalent of crashing at 94 miles per hour into a wall with a door in front of it.

02:17.631 --> 02:19.362
That doesn't feel good.
