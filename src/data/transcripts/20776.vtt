ï»¿In this age of social media and instant worldwide communication,...

00:06.603 --> 00:12.827
...the royal birth was announced in the traditional way with a brief notice posted outside Buckingham Palace.

00:13.219 --> 00:19.331
"Her Royal Highness, the Duchess of Cambridge, was safely delivered of a son at 4:24 pm today."

00:19.829 --> 00:22.665
"Her Royal Highness and the child are both doing well."

00:23.351 --> 00:26.229
Five characters shorter and it could have been a tweet.

00:26.786 --> 00:30.961
The baby's name has not yet been announced and no photo has been made public.

00:31.488 --> 00:36.293
As soon as he was born Monday afternoon, he became third in line to the British throne.

00:36.861 --> 00:40.795
The baby was born to the Duchess of Cambridge, the former Kate Middleton,...

00:41.071 --> 00:43.579
...wife of the queen's grandson Prince William.

00:44.007 --> 00:48.293
She spoke about the importance of family and her desire to have children...

00:48.359 --> 00:53.559
...during a Reuters interview shortly after she and the prince were engaged three years ago.

00:53.999 --> 01:01.389
It is very important to me and I hope we'll be able to have a happy family ourselves.

01:01.724 --> 01:06.407
Prince William is second in line to the throne after his father, Prince Charles.

01:06.691 --> 01:10.747
The royal baby is also the grandson of the late Princess Diana.

01:11.333 --> 01:15.755
The pomp and ceremony of a monarchy and its system of hereditary succession...

01:16.084 --> 01:18.307
...seem hopelessly outdated to some.

01:18.633 --> 01:22.441
But not to historian Miles Taylor at the University of London.

01:22.637 --> 01:24.875
I think there is still a place for monarchy.

01:25.449 --> 01:30.391
It is the most visible and familiar symbol of our national identity,...

01:30.851 --> 01:35.787
...whether that's British or English, or formerly imperial, now Commonwealth.

01:36.380 --> 01:41.406
People not only respect it, I think they are enthralled to it.

01:41.847 --> 01:45.301
Indeed, the royal baby was a celebrity before he was born,...

01:45.614 --> 01:48.413
...complete with his own unofficial souvenirs.

01:48.779 --> 01:51.397
But the role he will inherit will be very different...

01:51.556 --> 01:55.447
...from the one his great-grandmother took on more than 60 years ago.

01:55.899 --> 01:59.443
Queen Elizabeth presided over the evolution of the royal family...

01:59.747 --> 02:05.142
...from an unapproachable imperial ideal to a modern, less formal "First Family."

02:05.676 --> 02:12.093
Still, someday, barring unforeseen tragedy or political upheaval, the new royal baby will become king,...

02:12.333 --> 02:17.164
...head of state in more than a dozen countries, leader of the 54-nation Commonwealth...

02:17.481 --> 02:23.043
...and symbol of Britain's national identity, with a lineage dating back hundreds of years.

02:23.292 --> 02:28.491
It's a heavy responsibility, one the child will spend a lifetime preparing to take on.
