00:00.153 --> 00:01.781
Think back to your time in high school.

00:02.505 --> 00:04.303
Did you ever feel that you were in a prison?

00:05.287 --> 00:08.835
Did you ever feel that you were in a machine that had its own purposes and goals...

00:09.240 --> 00:12.197
...and had no relation to what you actually wanted to do or achieve?

00:12.970 --> 00:15.127
If you did, then you shouldn't be surprised...

00:15.373 --> 00:17.874
...because this reflects the nature of what the modern school is.

00:22.171 --> 00:26.444
The modern school was invented by the Prussians after 1806.

00:27.103 --> 00:29.892
Before then, education was delivered in many different ways.

00:30.119 --> 00:33.727
What we think of as a school was invented in that particular time and place.

00:34.079 --> 00:36.573
And it was invented for a very particular purpose,...

00:36.771 --> 00:39.713
...which was to produce loyal, obedient subjects and soldiers...

00:40.101 --> 00:43.693
...and people who would also be productive and obedient workers.

00:44.575 --> 00:48.969
It's this that explains why school is the way it is and has the features that it has.

00:49.377 --> 00:54.919
It explains why it is that the school day is divided up into rigid, time-structured blocks.

00:55.436 --> 01:00.507
It explains why it is that the organization of the school is hierarchical and highly structured.

01:01.138 --> 01:04.553
It explains why it is that people are taught with people their own age...

01:04.646 --> 01:07.955
...instead of people who are at the same stage of interest or ability as themselves.

01:08.399 --> 01:12.225
And it explains why in many school systems, one of the functions of the system...

01:12.493 --> 01:15.577
...is to direct people into particular life paths,...

01:15.717 --> 01:19.382
...to sort out young people into different kinds of career groups.

01:19.693 --> 01:22.508
To the extent that education actually does take place in schools,...

01:22.649 --> 01:24.609
...it's a happy accident or a by-product.

01:25.439 --> 01:28.435
Now, there are many people who work in schools who believe that education...

01:28.505 --> 01:30.578
...in fact is the main point of what they're doing,...

01:30.830 --> 01:33.669
...and who are trying very hard to educate the people in their charge.

01:34.437 --> 01:37.946
However, the problem is that the whole system they're working in, the way it's set up,...

01:38.027 --> 01:41.081
...and the way it's organized, is hostile to that goal and endeavor.

01:41.609 --> 01:46.049
So that they're in the unfortunate position of constantly trying to push water uphill, if you will.

01:46.414 --> 01:49.432
And any success they have is gained against the odds.

01:50.067 --> 01:54.188
What we need to realize is education and schooling are not the same thing.

01:54.997 --> 01:58.541
In fact, because we think that schooling is the same thing as education,...

01:58.683 --> 02:02.491
...we have a radically impoverished idea of what education is and could be.

02:03.335 --> 02:06.304
Why, for example, do we assume that education should only take place...

02:06.402 --> 02:08.009
...at one stage of a person's life?

02:08.500 --> 02:12.587
Education is something that can take place at any stage in someone's life, and indeed should do.

02:13.355 --> 02:16.567
Why assume that we have to educate people the same age all together?

02:16.755 --> 02:18.563
Surely this is a crazy way of doing it.

02:19.252 --> 02:22.959
Why do we have to deliver education in the highly structured and formalized way...

02:23.244 --> 02:24.903
...that schools require us to do it in?

02:25.834 --> 02:29.142
Education is something which is central to most people's lives.

02:29.666 --> 02:32.041
What we need to do is to get away from the idea...

02:32.300 --> 02:35.612
...that schools are the only way in which we can deliver education.
