Getting your daily exercise can feel like a chore, but with plenty of sun,...

00:07.250 --> 00:11.921
...it's time to start taking advantage of popular activities only summer can offer.

00:12.621 --> 00:16.333
Water sports like kayaking, canoeing, rafting and crew...

00:16.698 --> 00:19.467
...are ideal for an upper body and core workout.

00:19.960 --> 00:22.087
Rowing machines are great for cold weather,...

00:22.434 --> 00:26.076
...but there's nothing like hitting the water to engage every muscle in the body.

00:26.613 --> 00:30.357
Enjoy a solo adventure or invite friends to make it a group activity.

00:30.955 --> 00:33.978
Explore one of the country's dozens of national parks...

00:34.063 --> 00:36.369
...and hike your way into a smaller size.

00:36.784 --> 00:41.811
Rugged terrain confuses your muscles and the spectacular views are always changing.

00:42.209 --> 00:45.767
Make sure you wear supportive shoes and stay hydrated during your hike.

00:46.706 --> 00:48.827
Swimming can be fun all year round,...

00:48.957 --> 00:52.843
...but a swim in the ocean, a river or lake will really get the blood flowing.

00:53.123 --> 00:55.459
Improve muscle tone and condition your body...

00:55.549 --> 00:58.745
...without the bone-jarring effects some exercises have.

00:59.232 --> 01:02.421
Rollerblading is a simple physical activity for all ages.

01:02.899 --> 01:04.581
It works nearly every muscle group...

01:04.761 --> 01:07.631
...and kicks your butt with cardio at the same time.

01:08.155 --> 01:12.404
If you have the space, summer games like Frisbee, badminton or volleyball...

01:12.481 --> 01:15.473
...are engaging for groups and offer a fun way to get fit.

01:16.098 --> 01:18.264
Even a rigorous game of catch with the neighbors...

01:18.385 --> 01:20.836
...is better than spending summer on the couch.

01:21.312 --> 01:23.377
Being active every day can be a challenge,...

01:23.519 --> 01:27.629
...but keeping your physical activities fresh make staying fit fun.

01:28.029 --> 01:32.065
Find an activity you enjoy and make fitness a priority in your life.
