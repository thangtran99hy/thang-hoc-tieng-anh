00:00.963 --> 00:01.541
What are you gonna do?

00:02.439 --> 00:03.510
Take away my skates?

00:04.189 --> 00:05.029
Take away my puck?

00:05.869 --> 00:06.799
Take away my stick?

00:07.556 --> 00:08.626
You can borrow one of mine.

00:09.256 --> 00:09.687
Thanks.

00:10.958 --> 00:11.887
Take away my pads?

00:12.885 --> 00:14.125
I'll just wear thicker socks.

00:15.129 --> 00:16.221
Take away our rinks?

00:16.707 --> 00:17.883
We got a lot of lakes.

00:19.877 --> 00:21.045
A lot of cold lakes.

00:21.385 --> 00:22.673
A lot of cold lakes.

00:23.154 --> 00:23.847
And ponds.

00:24.213 --> 00:24.937
And streets.

00:25.413 --> 00:26.287
And tables.

00:27.765 --> 00:28.677
Take away Canada?

00:29.261 --> 00:30.089
I'll just go to Russia.

00:30.575 --> 00:32.192
I'd rather not, but I will.

00:36.904 --> 00:40.140
If you wanna take away hockey, you better take Canada and everything in it.

00:40.771 --> 00:43.084
Because if not, I'll strap rollers to my feet.

00:43.353 --> 00:44.599
I'd build a rink with my freezer.

00:44.977 --> 00:46.782
Find a patch of ice in the middle of the road.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.752
Make a puck out of frozen hamburgers.

00:50.012 --> 00:52.285
And hit at rocks with a fallen branch if I have to.

00:53.135 --> 00:55.492
And I will call it hockey.
