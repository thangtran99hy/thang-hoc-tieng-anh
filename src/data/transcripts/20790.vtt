When you think about your longer-term goals and how your age relates to those longer-term goals,...

00:11.508 --> 00:13.647
...you have a very different perspective than most.

00:14.299 --> 00:14.691
Right.

00:15.915 --> 00:19.105
I think when we start counting our age, we count up, right?

00:19.322 --> 00:21.363
We start zero when you're born and you count up.

00:21.569 --> 00:26.276
And it has this sort of built-in assumption that it is never going to end.

00:26.382 --> 00:28.447
It just goes on and on and on and you just keep counting up, right?

00:28.862 --> 00:32.925
But there are statistical realities that you are going to die.

00:33.396 --> 00:35.749
And you are going to die at some statistically average age.

00:37.023 --> 00:40.370
If I stay in good shape and I eat well, I'll probably live to around 85,...

00:40.451 --> 00:42.708
...and I can probably be a productive member of society...

00:42.795 --> 00:45.621
...in some way, shape or form until I'm about 75 or 80.

00:46.706 --> 00:52.655
So I don't report my age as 35, I report my age as 45.

00:53.345 --> 00:56.641
I have 45 years left to do something good in this world.

00:56.881 --> 01:00.260
I have 45 years left to achieve what I need to get done in this world.

01:00.574 --> 01:03.669
And so I very much count down,...

01:03.787 --> 01:05.877
...even though it might sound depressing, it's just the reality.

01:06.223 --> 01:09.533
But the inspiration is that it gives me a kick in the ass.
