00:07.108 --> 00:07.884
What do you want to trade?

00:08.896 --> 00:11.769
3,000 cash for this plus those three statues right there.

00:11.983 --> 00:13.455
Frank, Sammy, and Dean.

00:14.445 --> 00:17.233
The art of negotiation is an acquired skill.

00:17.934 --> 00:19.419
You acquire it over years.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.895
I think that you're well within the ballpark.

00:22.194 --> 00:24.641
It's just something that we couldn't use.

00:25.237 --> 00:29.269
The first offer that people offer you normally is pipe dreams.

00:29.429 --> 00:30.728
What are you trying to get out of that thing?

00:30.877 --> 00:32.626
I think it might be worth around nine?

00:33.077 --> 00:34.855
It's what they think they want.

00:35.245 --> 00:39.490
That might be worth nine in retail, but I'm not in the retail business.

00:39.906 --> 00:41.553
What you have to do is convince them.

00:42.193 --> 00:44.920
This is what it's worth and this is what you'll pay for.

00:45.315 --> 00:46.703
What do you think is the fair price?

00:46.889 --> 00:48.247
I'll give you 400 for it.

00:49.091 --> 00:50.265
400 sounds fair.

00:50.345 --> 00:50.830
I'll take it.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.357
Never take the first offer...

00:54.544 --> 00:55.323
How's 12 grand sound?

00:56.917 --> 00:57.458
15?

00:58.446 --> 00:58.819
12?

00:59.422 --> 01:02.595
...because if you take the first offer, you're not negotiating.

01:03.642 --> 01:04.875
You just ask what the guy will give you.

01:05.255 --> 01:07.287
We've got all kinds of hundred-dollar bills in the back, man.

01:07.395 --> 01:08.831
We'll make a nice little trade right now.

01:09.419 --> 01:13.020
The reason when you're haggling with someone you don't ever want to take the first offer...

01:13.765 --> 01:17.306
...is because you want to get it for your price, in a price you feel comfortable with.

01:17.880 --> 01:18.820
Yeah, I'd give you eight grand for it.

01:19.398 --> 01:20.065
Eight grand?

01:20.268 --> 01:20.709
Eight grand.

01:21.468 --> 01:22.723
I need to get at least 14 out of it.

01:23.209 --> 01:24.699
Do you know if the other guy is gonna capitulate?

01:25.549 --> 01:26.550
There is no negotiation.

01:27.332 --> 01:28.094
He takes what you offer.

01:28.839 --> 01:29.265
Two grand.

01:30.745 --> 01:32.089
2,000 it is, cash money.

01:32.359 --> 01:32.605
All right.

01:32.903 --> 01:33.663
Let's go do some paperwork.

01:33.747 --> 01:33.826
OK.

01:34.503 --> 01:38.010
The key to haggling is you've got to be willing to walk away from it.

01:38.451 --> 01:41.775
If you really love something, then that shows and you'll end up buying it,...

01:41.839 --> 01:42.690
...and you'll end up overpaying.

01:43.399 --> 01:43.657
Okay.

01:43.846 --> 01:44.423
Well, I thank you.

01:46.253 --> 01:46.767
Take your ring with you.

01:48.360 --> 01:48.873
I have to.

01:49.477 --> 01:50.051
Unfortunately.
