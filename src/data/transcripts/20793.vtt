How was it to kind of slip back into Xerxes' skin again?

00:10.716 --> 00:12.019
It was different.

00:12.143 --> 00:15.553
I've never done that before, never revisited a character.

00:16.899 --> 00:17.822
It was very interesting.

00:18.639 --> 00:24.967
It's been six years since the first one and the technology has advanced...

00:25.353 --> 00:29.180
...and things were a little different in terms of how we shot it.

00:29.743 --> 00:34.975
It's still like all blue screen and it's still a very, very challenging way of working.

00:36.293 --> 00:39.581
But I had fun and I think we'll look really, really good.

00:39.936 --> 00:43.285
I think the little things that I saw was really, really cool.
