Hello?

00:01.121 --> 00:01.891
Hi, Amanda.

00:02.364 --> 00:03.699
How's everything going with you?

00:03.961 --> 00:04.960
Everything is okay.

00:05.251 --> 00:05.854
Cool.

00:06.312 --> 00:09.091
Today, we're going to talk about our interests.

00:09.774 --> 00:11.445
I like learning languages.

00:11.907 --> 00:13.529
How many languages can you speak?

00:14.083 --> 00:16.241
I can speak three different languages:...

00:16.511 --> 00:19.691
...Korean, Japanese, and a little bit of English.

00:19.907 --> 00:22.144
Wow! What about Spanish?

00:22.303 --> 00:23.573
It's similar to English.

00:24.047 --> 00:26.905
No. Let me master English first.

00:27.108 --> 00:28.003
Good thinking.

00:28.357 --> 00:29.658
What else are you interested in?

00:30.189 --> 00:33.034
I enjoy outdoor activities like soccer.

00:33.551 --> 00:35.275
I remember you said that before.

00:35.632 --> 00:37.112
Do you like baseball, too?

00:37.471 --> 00:40.290
Yes, but soccer is more exciting than baseball.

00:40.656 --> 00:41.495
How about you?

00:41.827 --> 00:45.483
Me? I prefer indoor activities, like reading.

00:46.117 --> 00:47.469
Do you like watching TV?

00:47.737 --> 00:50.990
Not really, but I do watch historical documentaries.

00:51.314 --> 00:51.862
Like what?

00:52.681 --> 00:53.984
"The Death of JFK."

00:54.511 --> 00:56.290
I saw it on TV last night!

00:56.485 --> 00:59.395
I seriously think that the CIA was involved.
