Hello?

00:01.155 --> 00:01.997
Hi, Amanda.

00:02.253 --> 00:03.024
How's it going?

00:03.248 --> 00:04.019
Great!

00:04.495 --> 00:05.086
You know what?

00:05.353 --> 00:07.505
I'm looking at the map of Korea right now.

00:07.831 --> 00:10.780
Really? What part of Korea are you looking at now?

00:11.157 --> 00:12.387
Of course, Seoul.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.729
It's the biggest city in Korea, isn't it?

00:15.068 --> 00:17.727
Yeah, what part of Seoul would you like to visit?

00:18.245 --> 00:19.717
Insa-dong seems attractive.

00:20.106 --> 00:21.537
That's a perfect place!

00:21.975 --> 00:24.523
You can find all kinds of traditional stuff there.

00:24.753 --> 00:25.608
That's great.

00:25.846 --> 00:29.341
I always wanted to show my family some unique, traditional stuff.

00:30.230 --> 00:33.233
Insa-dong will be the best place to get souvenirs.

00:33.728 --> 00:36.157
How can I get there from Jamsil subway station?

00:36.931 --> 00:39.314
Take subway line number two, green line.

00:39.808 --> 00:43.261
Transfer at City Hall to line number three, orange line.

00:43.575 --> 00:45.090
Hold on, let me write it down.

00:45.909 --> 00:48.108
You get off at An-gook station.

00:48.518 --> 00:49.769
Is Insa-dong near there?

00:50.070 --> 00:52.379
Yes, it takes ten minutes on foot.

00:52.823 --> 00:55.295
Take exit number two and go straight.

00:55.806 --> 00:57.632
The street will lead you to Insa-dong.

00:58.325 --> 00:59.917
Okay, I got it.

01:00.211 --> 01:01.360
Thanks for the directions.

01:01.619 --> 01:02.552
You are welcome.
