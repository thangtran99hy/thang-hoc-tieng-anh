Hello?

00:01.162 --> 00:01.973
Hi, Amanda!

00:02.277 --> 00:02.774
What's up?

00:03.107 --> 00:03.869
Not much.

00:04.366 --> 00:05.747
You sound very excited!

00:05.976 --> 00:09.245
Yeah, I ran into one of my old friends on the street.

00:09.703 --> 00:10.517
By accident?

00:10.939 --> 00:12.310
What a pleasant surprise.

00:12.576 --> 00:15.874
Yes! We went to the same school six years ago.

00:16.327 --> 00:17.629
How did you keep in touch with her?

00:18.180 --> 00:18.889
I couldn't.

00:19.174 --> 00:21.144
She and her family moved to Canada.

00:21.485 --> 00:23.524
Then, is she moving back to Korea?

00:23.847 --> 00:26.558
No. She's just staying here for a few days.

00:26.967 --> 00:29.099
She wants to see her relatives and friends.

00:29.415 --> 00:31.626
She seems like a very special friend to you.

00:32.057 --> 00:34.128
Yes, she's like my sister.

00:34.457 --> 00:35.901
What makes her so special?

00:36.660 --> 00:39.436
She's not only sweet but also thoughtful.

00:39.759 --> 00:41.367
What else can you remember about her?

00:41.819 --> 00:43.566
She used to play tennis.

00:44.192 --> 00:46.050
Is she a professional tennis player?

00:46.673 --> 00:50.322
No, but she is a professional mom of two lovely kids.

00:50.504 --> 00:51.657
That's wonderful!
