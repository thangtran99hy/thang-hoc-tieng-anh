On August the 6th, 1945,...

00:09.164 --> 00:13.863
...two American Superfortress bombers arrived over the Japanese city of Hiroshima...

00:14.264 --> 00:17.035
...on the world's most devastating military mission.

00:17.669 --> 00:23.386
The Enola Gay, with Colonel Paul Tibbets at the controls, was about to drop the first atomic bomb:...

00:23.764 --> 00:26.973
...a weapon conceived by a group of international scientists...

00:27.343 --> 00:29.627
...based at Los Alamos in the United States.

00:29.975 --> 00:33.566
So far, no one knew exactly what effect the bomb would have...

00:33.935 --> 00:39.133
...either on the unsuspecting inhabitants below or on the crew of the plane itself.

00:39.581 --> 00:40.731
They were soon to find out.

00:41.095 --> 00:44.553
The bomb went off, the whole inside of the airplane just lit up...

00:44.681 --> 00:46.465
...as if someone had set off a flashbulb.

00:46.687 --> 00:50.411
And then we had to wait, and this was our big worry, is what would the blast do...

00:50.554 --> 00:52.068
...when the blast got to the airplane.

00:52.749 --> 00:57.172
And finally, the blast did arrive, it was like being in an ash can and getting someone kicking.

00:58.153 --> 01:05.565
Then we crowded to the window and saw just a whole city completely covered in smoke...

01:05.666 --> 01:09.425
...with this very tall mushroom cloud rising from it.

01:16.961 --> 01:21.834
President Truman had already threatened the Japanese with a rain of ruin from the air,...

01:21.920 --> 01:24.423
...the like of which has never been seen on this Earth.

01:24.847 --> 01:28.373
When the truth was revealed, his words seemed an understatement.

01:35.671 --> 01:39.504
Buildings vaporized, so did the clothes on people's backs.

01:39.849 --> 01:41.977
Was it a bomb that should never have been dropped?

01:42.276 --> 01:43.523
Some people thought so.

01:43.731 --> 01:47.365
Others argued that it shortened the war and kept the subsequent peace.

01:47.751 --> 01:48.933
One thing was not in doubt.

01:49.391 --> 01:53.249
Hiroshima taught mankind the awful truth about nuclear weapons...

01:53.507 --> 01:55.742
...and just what horror they could bestow.
