Hello?

00:01.937 --> 00:02.821
Hi, Amanda!

00:03.079 --> 00:03.870
How have you been?

00:04.838 --> 00:05.831
Not so good.

00:06.097 --> 00:07.607
I'm on my way back home.

00:07.911 --> 00:08.695
Are you sick?

00:09.342 --> 00:11.035
I think I caught a cold.

00:11.337 --> 00:12.392
That's not good.

00:12.767 --> 00:14.005
What symptoms do you have?

00:14.386 --> 00:16.415
I keep coughing and sneezing.

00:16.845 --> 00:18.330
Do you have a fever, too?

00:18.685 --> 00:21.193
Not only a fever but also a headache!

00:21.644 --> 00:22.756
Did you see a doctor?

00:23.117 --> 00:25.499
Yes. He prescribed me some medicine.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.239
Don't forget to take a rest.

00:27.465 --> 00:28.688
That always helps.

00:29.146 --> 00:29.737
Thank you.

00:29.987 --> 00:31.193
I'll keep that in mind.

00:31.731 --> 00:35.135
Oh! I forgot about the appointment with the dentist!

00:35.564 --> 00:37.085
Do you have a toothache, too?

00:37.351 --> 00:40.749
Yes. I think my wisdom tooth is breaking through.

00:41.297 --> 00:42.083
Does it hurt?

00:42.675 --> 00:43.680
A little bit.

00:44.031 --> 00:46.253
I think I'm going to have it pulled out.

00:46.514 --> 00:47.417
Good thinking.

00:47.700 --> 00:49.338
You'd better find a good dentist.

00:49.789 --> 00:51.329
Is it that painful?

00:51.693 --> 00:53.719
It depends on the dentist's skill.
