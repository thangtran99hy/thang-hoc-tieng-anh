Hello?

00:01.549 --> 00:02.285
Hi, Amanda.

00:02.799 --> 00:03.631
How are you doing?

00:03.857 --> 00:04.967
I'm doing fine.

00:05.061 --> 00:05.648
Thank you.

00:06.181 --> 00:07.161
Guess what I'm doing?

00:07.323 --> 00:08.012
I don't know.

00:08.265 --> 00:08.981
What are you doing?

00:09.212 --> 00:10.585
I'm preparing breakfast.

00:11.014 --> 00:12.637
I'm making scrambled eggs!

00:13.096 --> 00:14.246
Do you know how to make it?

00:14.587 --> 00:16.450
Of course. It's very easy.

00:16.789 --> 00:19.241
First, beat two eggs with a fork.

00:19.469 --> 00:20.384
Go on, please.

00:20.567 --> 00:21.195
I'm listening.

00:21.642 --> 00:25.174
In a pan, melt butter and cook the eggs over low heat.

00:25.522 --> 00:27.189
That doesn't sound too difficult.

00:27.367 --> 00:28.745
No, not at all.

00:29.121 --> 00:30.869
Don't forget to keep stirring though.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.543
Okay. What about chicken soup?

00:33.705 --> 00:34.819
Do you know how to make it?

00:35.316 --> 00:35.897
Sure!

00:36.789 --> 00:40.015
Place chicken pieces in a large pot, then cover with water.

00:40.289 --> 00:41.210
I can do that.

00:41.766 --> 00:44.051
Boil for 15 to 20 minutes.

00:44.543 --> 00:45.823
Do you have any vegetables?

00:47.261 --> 00:48.331
Will carrots do?

00:48.675 --> 00:50.299
Sure, that's good enough.

00:50.941 --> 00:52.552
Add carrots and spices.

00:53.019 --> 00:54.514
I usually use salt.

00:55.119 --> 00:56.567
Do I have to boil again?

00:56.968 --> 00:58.813
Just simmer for an hour and a half.

00:59.433 --> 01:01.714
I should invite my friends over for dinner tonight.
