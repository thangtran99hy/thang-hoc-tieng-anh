Hello?

00:01.213 --> 00:02.054
Hi, Amanda.

00:02.180 --> 00:03.181
How are you doing?

00:03.450 --> 00:04.617
I'm doing great.

00:04.890 --> 00:06.643
What were you doing before I called you?

00:06.991 --> 00:08.694
I just came back home.

00:09.099 --> 00:10.145
Did you go somewhere?

00:10.432 --> 00:12.178
I went shopping with my brother.

00:12.757 --> 00:14.433
Did you buy anything for yourself?

00:14.553 --> 00:15.583
Yes, I did.

00:15.929 --> 00:17.311
I bought some clothes.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.005
What kind of clothes did you buy?

00:19.312 --> 00:25.171
I bought a jacket, a pair of blue jeans, a skirt and a red t-shirt.

00:25.297 --> 00:25.950
Wow.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.051
That's a lot.

00:27.221 --> 00:28.235
You must be rich!

00:28.414 --> 00:29.375
Not really.

00:29.655 --> 00:31.707
They were having a big sale.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.373
What about your brother?

00:33.557 --> 00:34.589
Did he buy anything?

00:34.741 --> 00:35.355
Yes.

00:35.607 --> 00:39.261
He bought a baseball cap, a belt, and sneakers.

00:39.502 --> 00:41.761
I guess you guys like to dress down, don't you?

00:42.121 --> 00:45.412
Well, I do, but I'm not so sure about my brother.

00:45.709 --> 00:47.022
Does he like to dress up?

00:47.261 --> 00:50.741
Yes, and he looks good in a suit, indeed.

00:50.933 --> 00:52.633
Oh, I want to see him.
