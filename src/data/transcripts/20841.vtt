Hello?

00:01.162 --> 00:02.026
Hi, Amanda.

00:02.183 --> 00:02.919
How are you?

00:03.345 --> 00:05.124
I'm tired and sleepy.

00:05.290 --> 00:06.857
I'm still in the office.

00:06.974 --> 00:07.571
Really?

00:07.707 --> 00:08.625
Go home!

00:08.743 --> 00:11.148
I want to, but I can't!

00:11.408 --> 00:12.234
Why not?

00:12.426 --> 00:14.655
I have some paperwork to do tonight.

00:14.826 --> 00:15.690
What a pity!

00:15.953 --> 00:17.558
Can we have our lesson today?

00:17.732 --> 00:18.381
Yes.

00:18.602 --> 00:20.067
I need a break anyway.

00:20.211 --> 00:21.085
Okay, then.

00:21.420 --> 00:23.302
What are you going to do after your work?

00:23.661 --> 00:27.144
I'm so tired, so I will just go home.

00:27.489 --> 00:29.220
Do you always go straight home?

00:30.190 --> 00:31.004
Not really.

00:31.239 --> 00:33.687
Sometimes, I hang out with my friends.

00:33.953 --> 00:36.155
What do you usually do with your friends?

00:36.373 --> 00:38.645
We go for dinner or a drink.
