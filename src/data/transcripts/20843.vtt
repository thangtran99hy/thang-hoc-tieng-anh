ï»¿Hello?

00:01.057 --> 00:01.750
Hi, Amanda.

00:02.277 --> 00:02.923
How's it going?

00:03.195 --> 00:04.313
It's going great.

00:04.587 --> 00:05.659
You sound excited.

00:05.948 --> 00:06.795
What's going on?

00:07.189 --> 00:09.077
I am preparing a surprise party.

00:09.265 --> 00:10.281
How fun!

00:10.581 --> 00:11.624
What is the party for?

00:12.065 --> 00:13.825
A friend of mine is pregnant.

00:14.019 --> 00:15.155
That's lovely.

00:15.569 --> 00:16.577
So, what is your plan?

00:17.300 --> 00:20.092
First of all, we're inviting all of her friends.

00:20.394 --> 00:21.110
What else?

00:21.559 --> 00:25.265
We'll be decorating a party room and then wrapping all the gifts.

00:25.651 --> 00:26.679
What are you getting for her?

00:27.297 --> 00:28.923
I got her packs of diapers.

00:29.539 --> 00:30.945
Are you getting any munchies?

00:31.463 --> 00:33.993
I think we are going to bring our own dishes.

00:34.489 --> 00:35.450
That's a good idea.

00:35.727 --> 00:36.899
It will save you some time.

00:37.457 --> 00:40.133
And of course, we will hide ourselves.

00:40.382 --> 00:41.488
That's the fun part.

00:41.799 --> 00:44.491
Yes, but remember not to shout, "Surprise!"

00:44.869 --> 00:45.900
You know, she's pregnant.

00:46.323 --> 00:46.807
Right.

00:47.125 --> 00:48.404
I almost forgot.

00:48.879 --> 00:49.561
Have fun!
