It was a Saturday afternoon in May...

00:19.480 --> 00:24.527
...and I suddenly realized that the next day was Mother's Day,...

00:24.979 --> 00:26.757
...and I hadn't gotten anything for my mom.

00:27.062 --> 00:30.327
So I started thinking about what should I get my mom for Mother's Day.

00:30.799 --> 00:35.121
I thought, why don't I make her an interactive Mother's Day card...

00:35.659 --> 00:41.313
...using the Scratch software that I'd been developing with my research group at the MIT Media Lab?

00:42.355 --> 00:45.132
We developed it so that people could easily create...

00:45.313 --> 00:49.281
...their own interactive stories and games and animations,...

00:49.897 --> 00:52.451
...and then share their creations with one another.

00:53.757 --> 00:59.618
So I thought this would be an opportunity to use Scratch to make an interactive card for my mom.

01:00.334 --> 01:05.779
Before making my own Mother's Day card, I thought I would take a look at the Scratch website.

01:06.120 --> 01:12.235
So over the last several years, kids around the world ages eight and up have shared their projects.

01:12.931 --> 01:15.852
And I thought, well I wonder if of those three million projects,...

01:15.928 --> 01:18.755
...whether anyone else has thought to put up Mother's Day cards.

01:19.565 --> 01:23.017
So in the search box I typed in "Mother's Day."

01:23.851 --> 01:29.553
And I was surprised and delighted to see a list of dozens and dozens of Mother's Day cards...

01:29.758 --> 01:31.375
...that showed up on the Scratch website,...

01:31.877 --> 01:36.408
...many of them just in the past 24 hours by procrastinators just like myself.

01:37.527 --> 01:39.175
So I started taking a look at them.

01:40.607 --> 01:44.668
I saw one of them that featured a kitten and her mom....

01:45.363 --> 01:47.200
...and wishing her mom "Happy Mother's Day."

01:49.724 --> 01:54.069
And the creator very considerately offered a replay for her mom.

01:56.240 --> 01:58.163
Another one was an interactive project...

01:58.286 --> 02:01.271
...where when you moved the mouse over the letters of "Happy Mom Day,"...

02:01.657 --> 02:05.301
...it reveals a special "Happy Mother's Day" slogan.

02:07.880 --> 02:12.182
In this one, the creator told a narrative about how she had Googled...

02:12.610 --> 02:15.047
...to find out when Mother's Day was happening.

02:17.783 --> 02:20.044
And then once she found out when Mother's Day was happening,...

02:20.491 --> 02:24.641
...she delivered a special Mother's Day greeting of how much she loved her mom.

02:26.493 --> 02:30.307
So I really enjoyed looking at these projects and interacting with these projects.

02:30.718 --> 02:34.105
In fact, I liked it so much that instead of making my own project,...

02:34.513 --> 02:37.670
...I sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects.

02:38.970 --> 02:42.463
And actually, she reacted exactly the way that I hoped that she would.

02:42.836 --> 02:47.190
She wrote back to me and she said, "I'm so proud to have a son that created the software..."

02:47.414 --> 02:50.248
"...that allowed these kids to make Mother's Day cards for their mothers."

02:51.791 --> 02:54.991
So my mom was happy and that made me happy.

02:55.844 --> 02:59.201
But actually, I was even happier for another reason.

02:59.823 --> 03:03.567
I was happy because these kids were using Scratch...

03:03.943 --> 03:05.853
...just in the way that we had hoped that they would.
