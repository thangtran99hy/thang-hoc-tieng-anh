Hello?

00:01.836 --> 00:02.567
Hi, Amanda.

00:02.901 --> 00:03.327
What's up?

00:03.688 --> 00:04.536
Nothing much.

00:04.778 --> 00:05.228
And you?

00:05.488 --> 00:06.199
Same here.

00:06.433 --> 00:07.217
Same as usual.

00:08.028 --> 00:10.249
Oh, hey, do you like soccer?

00:11.051 --> 00:14.512
Well, I don't play soccer but I like watching the games.

00:14.940 --> 00:15.610
How about you?

00:16.093 --> 00:16.851
I love it.

00:17.247 --> 00:18.997
I played soccer this morning, too.

00:19.433 --> 00:20.246
Aren't you tired?

00:20.588 --> 00:21.993
How often do you play soccer?

00:22.651 --> 00:23.323
Twice a week.

00:23.659 --> 00:25.544
Wednesday and Sunday morning.

00:25.994 --> 00:27.494
I might have to do that, too.

00:27.728 --> 00:28.861
I'm getting fat.

00:29.420 --> 00:31.571
Well, try yoga then.

00:31.873 --> 00:34.007
It's the best way to lose weight.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.933
I know but I prefer outdoor activities.

00:37.491 --> 00:38.742
How about cycling?

00:39.475 --> 00:41.709
I used to do cycling and I'll tell you this.

00:41.961 --> 00:43.269
It can be boring.

00:43.603 --> 00:46.541
How about this, I'm going to the gym tonight.

00:46.858 --> 00:48.149
We can work out together.

00:48.550 --> 00:49.702
That sounds fun!

00:50.025 --> 00:51.715
I always wanted to get a six-pack.

00:52.522 --> 00:52.984
Pardon?

00:53.536 --> 00:55.079
What is a "six-pack"?

00:55.464 --> 00:56.829
Muscles in your abs.

00:57.063 --> 00:59.663
Oh, my brother has a six-pack.

00:59.933 --> 01:00.801
It's not hard.

01:01.167 --> 01:02.265
It just takes time.

01:02.570 --> 01:03.546
Are you serious?

01:03.696 --> 01:05.361
Yes, give it a try.
