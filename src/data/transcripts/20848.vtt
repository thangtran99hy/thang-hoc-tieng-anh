Hello?

00:01.461 --> 00:02.524
Hello, Amanda.

00:02.735 --> 00:04.004
How are you doing this evening?

00:04.245 --> 00:04.748
Good.

00:04.835 --> 00:05.679
How about you?

00:05.811 --> 00:06.744
I'm fine, too.

00:06.824 --> 00:07.327
Thank you.

00:08.157 --> 00:09.854
I'm so excited.

00:10.136 --> 00:12.733
I'm making a plan for the summer vacation.

00:12.877 --> 00:13.536
Really?

00:13.791 --> 00:14.941
Sounds great!

00:15.223 --> 00:16.241
What is your plan?

00:16.399 --> 00:18.810
I'm planning to go to New Zealand!

00:18.921 --> 00:19.869
Wow.

00:19.994 --> 00:21.064
That's great!

00:21.325 --> 00:22.551
So, when are you leaving?

00:22.835 --> 00:23.547
In a month.

00:23.723 --> 00:25.655
I can't wait to go.

00:25.865 --> 00:27.373
How long are you staying there?

00:27.532 --> 00:29.467
I'll be there for three weeks.

00:29.664 --> 00:31.004
That's pretty long.

00:31.242 --> 00:32.982
Where in New Zealand are you staying?

00:33.245 --> 00:34.992
I will stay in Queenstown.

00:35.333 --> 00:36.621
Oh, I see.

00:36.873 --> 00:38.593
What will you do in Queenstown?

00:39.122 --> 00:41.145
I will go bungee jumping.

00:41.439 --> 00:44.117
It's a very popular activity there.

00:44.458 --> 00:45.426
Aren't you scared?

00:45.621 --> 00:46.877
I'm quite brave!

00:47.249 --> 00:48.275
It will be fun!

00:48.428 --> 00:49.179
Yeah.

00:49.295 --> 00:50.815
It sounds very exciting.

00:51.195 --> 00:53.031
Don't forget to bring me a souvenir.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.864
Do you have anything particular in mind?

00:55.946 --> 00:57.567
Anything traditional will do!
