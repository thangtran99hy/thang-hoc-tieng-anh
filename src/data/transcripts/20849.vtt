Hello?

00:01.311 --> 00:03.360
Hi, can I speak to Amanda?

00:03.529 --> 00:04.405
Speaking.

00:04.644 --> 00:05.923
How are you feeling today?

00:06.177 --> 00:07.333
So-so.

00:07.685 --> 00:08.489
What happened?

00:08.601 --> 00:09.745
Is everything all right?

00:10.157 --> 00:13.431
Well, my sister's not talking to me.

00:13.619 --> 00:14.521
Oh no.

00:14.774 --> 00:16.696
What happened between you and your sister?

00:17.029 --> 00:18.470
Ok, hear me out.

00:19.131 --> 00:21.545
You know my cat died a long time ago.

00:22.083 --> 00:23.331
Yes, I remember.

00:23.518 --> 00:24.870
So you got a new puppy.

00:25.171 --> 00:30.201
Yesterday, I gave him some snacks, and he got sick last night.

00:30.427 --> 00:31.442
Oh no!

00:31.561 --> 00:32.539
Is he okay?

00:32.784 --> 00:35.585
Yes, but my sister isn't.

00:35.744 --> 00:36.583
Of course not!

00:36.667 --> 00:38.111
You almost killed the puppy!

00:38.337 --> 00:41.566
I know, but it's not only my fault.

00:41.907 --> 00:43.956
She did the same the other day.

00:44.118 --> 00:45.348
Oh, come on.

00:45.633 --> 00:47.215
Why don't you talk to her first?

00:47.494 --> 00:49.450
Yeah, I'm thinking about it.

00:49.607 --> 00:50.249
Good!

00:50.352 --> 00:51.547
I'm glad to hear that.

00:51.872 --> 00:53.254
Thanks for your advice.

00:53.365 --> 00:55.003
Hey, anytime.
