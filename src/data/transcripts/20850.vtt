ï»¿Hello?

00:01.273 --> 00:01.981
Hi, Amanda.

00:02.470 --> 00:03.181
How's it going?

00:03.607 --> 00:04.789
Everything is fine.

00:04.886 --> 00:05.999
It's Easter today!

00:06.291 --> 00:06.709
Yes.

00:07.073 --> 00:09.349
My daughter got me a chocolate egg from her church.

00:09.803 --> 00:10.961
That's so sweet of her.

00:11.323 --> 00:13.721
What kind of holidays do you have in your country?

00:14.182 --> 00:17.493
Well, we have New Year's Day in January, of course.

00:17.811 --> 00:18.487
Same here.

00:18.837 --> 00:20.285
Do you make resolutions, too?

00:20.570 --> 00:23.821
Yeah, I think that is the common tradition all around the world.

00:24.060 --> 00:25.158
I think so, too.

00:25.586 --> 00:26.961
How about in February?

00:27.187 --> 00:28.540
Do you have Valentine's Day?

00:28.867 --> 00:29.381
Yes.

00:29.769 --> 00:34.127
By the way, I heard that you have White Day in March and Black Day in April.

00:34.392 --> 00:35.156
Is that right?

00:35.568 --> 00:38.763
Yes, but I think they're celebrated only in Korea.

00:39.089 --> 00:40.148
That's interesting.

00:40.527 --> 00:41.839
Have you seen any parades?

00:42.231 --> 00:44.767
Not in person, but on TV.

00:45.331 --> 00:46.755
What was the most impressive one?

00:47.217 --> 00:49.230
A street parade in Switzerland.

00:49.522 --> 00:51.197
Did you find anything interesting?

00:51.588 --> 00:54.303
Yes, they were dancing with techno music.

00:54.637 --> 00:55.553
Techno music?

00:55.894 --> 00:57.905
Wow, I want to see that, too.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.460
I just can't picture it.

01:00.138 --> 01:00.781
What else?

01:01.105 --> 01:02.579
Do you celebrate Thanksgiving?

01:02.841 --> 01:03.528
Sure.

01:03.879 --> 01:06.961
That reminds me of turkey and homemade gravy sauce.
