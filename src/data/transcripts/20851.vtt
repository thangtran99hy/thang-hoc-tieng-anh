ï»¿Hello?

00:01.040 --> 00:01.844
Hey, Amanda.

00:02.089 --> 00:02.650
How are you?

00:03.147 --> 00:04.221
Not so good.

00:04.615 --> 00:05.275
Why not?

00:06.275 --> 00:06.916
What happened?

00:07.453 --> 00:11.644
We had a big storm last night and my house is damaged badly.

00:12.153 --> 00:12.982
Oh my god.

00:13.303 --> 00:14.768
Are you and your family okay?

00:15.295 --> 00:18.545
We are all right but there are things that need to be fixed.

00:18.857 --> 00:21.028
It must have been a really huge storm.

00:21.227 --> 00:22.485
Yes, it was.

00:22.839 --> 00:25.096
All the windows are broken, first of all.

00:25.545 --> 00:26.958
Every single one of them?

00:27.236 --> 00:27.763
Yes.

00:28.041 --> 00:31.481
Second, the roof is leaking and the wall is cracked.

00:31.779 --> 00:33.293
Oh my god.

00:33.457 --> 00:35.052
That's worse than I expected.

00:35.678 --> 00:38.326
We had a blackout for the past eight hours.

00:38.543 --> 00:40.352
I'm so sorry to hear that.

00:40.949 --> 00:42.463
Did you call up a repair person?

00:43.164 --> 00:43.640
Yes.

00:43.797 --> 00:45.671
He's looking around the house right now.

00:46.125 --> 00:47.727
Hope everything turns out okay.

00:48.586 --> 00:49.815
Oh my goodness!

00:49.946 --> 00:50.302
What?

00:50.944 --> 00:52.736
The pipes are broken!

00:53.219 --> 00:53.790
Okay.

00:54.033 --> 00:55.543
Why don't we stop our lesson here?

00:55.856 --> 00:57.423
Call a plumber right now.
