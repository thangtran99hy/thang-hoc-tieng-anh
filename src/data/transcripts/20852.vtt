So in case you haven't noticed,...

00:03.423 --> 00:05.243
...work is a bit different these days.

00:05.553 --> 00:08.913
It's not just jobs changing; the whole culture is different.

00:09.243 --> 00:13.297
Everything from Ted, who's 24, and can't believe you'd actually want him...

00:13.529 --> 00:15.533
...to fill out the whole status report,...

00:15.656 --> 00:20.152
...to Jimbo, who's 35 and busy working anywhere but the office.

00:20.326 --> 00:24.741
And Sharon, aged 50, who just might be the best juggler of all things...

00:24.915 --> 00:26.513
...and most addicted one of the batch.

00:26.663 --> 00:29.634
These days, things are moving at the speed of a tweet,...

00:29.913 --> 00:33.751
...and people want access to company systems and data at all times.

00:34.027 --> 00:38.047
Basically, our work styles have become as unique as our people.

00:38.623 --> 00:39.801
