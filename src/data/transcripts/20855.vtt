Well, Muslims around the world have celebrated one of the biggest holidays on the Islamic calendar.

00:06.284 --> 00:11.619
Eid al-Fitr begins with the new moon and marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan.

00:13.157 --> 00:16.099
Despite heavy rain across much of Southern Asia,...

00:16.494 --> 00:21.435
...people braved the wet to pack into local mosques like this one in Bangladesh.

00:24.610 --> 00:28.776
By the grace of God, we have successfully performed the fasting during Ramadan.

00:29.189 --> 00:31.931
Today, I've attended the first prayer session in this mosque,...

00:32.437 --> 00:36.519
...and now we'll go meet with friends and relatives to exchange Eid greetings.

00:37.025 --> 00:43.979
The celebration is a key milestone marking three days of feasting and joy after a month of discipline.

00:44.577 --> 00:47.660
In India, the army even hosted an Iftar reception...

00:47.757 --> 00:51.953
...with the hope of fostering harmony in India's troubled Kashmir region.

00:55.165 --> 01:00.281
We're praying for peace, prosperity and brotherhood, and we must foster the spirit of brotherhood.

01:00.646 --> 01:03.887
We must consider others' lives as precious as our own.

01:04.195 --> 01:09.488
This is a message spread by Islam and whatever we do must be in the interest of the nation.

01:10.285 --> 01:12.985
Millions are celebrating Eid across Pakistan,...

01:13.357 --> 01:16.778
...though in Karachi, tight security measures are being imposed.

01:17.246 --> 01:22.764
But there and in other areas, Pakistanis are determined to enjoy their days of celebration.

01:24.718 --> 01:28.596
Eid is a festival for all Muslims and it is collective happiness.

01:28.977 --> 01:32.260
Muslims around the world celebrate Eid with passion.

01:32.859 --> 01:36.477
Muslims in Malaysia and Indonesia have also held their prayers,...

01:36.746 --> 01:40.699
...with Malaysians practicing the custom of cleaning the graves of family members...

01:41.004 --> 01:44.480
...in the hope of passing on piousness to the next generation.
