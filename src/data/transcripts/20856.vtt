Welcome to the University of Nottingham and the Department of Theology and Religious Studies.

00:06.125 --> 00:09.317
Welcome to another in the series "Sacred Calendars",...

00:09.867 --> 00:13.702
...where we look at festivals and feasts in different religious traditions.

00:14.847 --> 00:20.492
With me today, we have Mr. Shujahat Aslam, who is an imam here in Nottingham,...

00:21.251 --> 00:26.216
...who occasionally also gives the Friday sermon at the University of Nottingham's mosque.

00:26.770 --> 00:27.903
Shujahat, welcome.

00:28.138 --> 00:28.444
Thank you.

00:29.351 --> 00:32.573
Today we'll be talking with you about Eid al-Fitr.

00:33.558 --> 00:37.473
First of all, can you tell us a little bit about what Eid al-Fitr is?

00:37.646 --> 00:37.861
Sure.

00:38.517 --> 00:41.251
The word "eid" in Arabic means celebration or festivity.

00:41.769 --> 00:45.154
So Eid al-Fitr is the first festivity in the Islamic calendar.

00:46.267 --> 00:48.041
It's linked to the blessed month of Ramadan.

00:48.326 --> 00:50.996
Ramadan is a month in which Muslims the world over fast.

00:51.441 --> 00:54.327
That means that they don't have anything to eat or drink throughout daylight hours.

00:54.993 --> 00:57.922
Fasting in the month of Ramadan lasts for 29 or 30 days.

00:58.583 --> 01:02.531
After 29 days, Muslims go out to seek if it's the day of Eid al-Fitr or not.

01:03.112 --> 01:05.567
This is determined by whether the new moon is sighted,....

01:06.030 --> 01:08.411
...which shows that the Islamic month of Ramadan has finished.

01:09.725 --> 01:11.981
If the new moon is sighted, it means that it's the day of Eid,...

01:12.048 --> 01:13.773
...so all the fasting ends on that day.

01:14.513 --> 01:16.977
And in the Islamic calendar, the night precedes the day.

01:17.318 --> 01:21.677
So therefore first of all, you have the night of the day of Eid al-Fitr, followed by the day.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.867
So you're looking for the moon when?

01:24.140 --> 01:24.371
Yeah.

01:24.559 --> 01:24.907
Tonight?

01:25.253 --> 01:26.618
Yeah, that's right, so in the evening.

01:26.703 --> 01:29.338
So once the 29th fast is finished, you open your fast,...

01:29.536 --> 01:29.792
Okay.

01:30.428 --> 01:34.108
...so this is kind of evening time, therefore people will go out and see if the moon is sighted.

01:34.240 --> 01:37.057
If there's a new moon there, it means that the month of Ramadan has finished...

01:37.156 --> 01:41.283
...and the new month has started, therefore this indicates that's the beginning of Eid al-Fitr.

01:42.435 --> 01:45.224
So you go through the night which is pretty much the same as previous nights,...

01:45.291 --> 01:48.732
...except that you don't pray the kind of night prayer, the tarawih prayer.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.943
But really, Eid starts in the morning.

01:51.667 --> 01:55.465
And the first and most important thing as a kind of religious ritual or festival...

01:55.527 --> 01:58.382
...that you have to do is to be charitable on the day of Eid.

01:58.937 --> 02:02.543
So you have to pay a certain amount of money called "Zakat al-Fitr".

02:02.759 --> 02:03.045
Okay.

02:03.200 --> 02:07.692
This is given generally in foodstuff, there's kind of grain or wheat or barley,...

02:08.473 --> 02:11.619
...the equivalent of about five pounds worth of foodstuff is given to the poor.

02:12.805 --> 02:16.001
So in an Islamic country, you'd go before the time of the Eid prayer,...

02:16.355 --> 02:19.305
...and the poor people would be gathered and you'd give that foodstuffs to them.

02:19.690 --> 02:22.199
Clearly in the UK, it's quite not easy to do that.

02:22.535 --> 02:25.020
So generally what Muslims would do during the month of Ramadan,...

02:25.311 --> 02:27.073
...they would give the money to an Islamic charity,...

02:27.563 --> 02:31.300
...where they arrange to spend that money on their behalf to the poor wherever they may be.

02:31.657 --> 02:32.810
On the morning of the Eid?

02:32.926 --> 02:35.465
Yeah, generally it should be done before the Eid Salah.

02:35.703 --> 02:39.598
So generally, they try and do it as soon as possible, up to the time of the Eid Salah.

02:40.601 --> 02:45.217
The benefit of this is the poor can participate in Eid along with the rest of society as well.
