Hello?

00:01.347 --> 00:02.092
Hey, Amanda.

00:02.327 --> 00:02.821
What's up?

00:03.120 --> 00:03.923
Nothing much.

00:04.337 --> 00:04.987
Where are you?

00:05.545 --> 00:07.414
I'm at a hair salon to dye my hair.

00:07.819 --> 00:08.525
Really?

00:08.905 --> 00:10.291
What color are you changing it to?

00:10.633 --> 00:11.925
I want it blonde.

00:12.400 --> 00:13.964
It will be cute with my bangs.

00:14.319 --> 00:16.656
Are your friends and family okay with your decision?

00:17.107 --> 00:17.884
Why not?

00:18.117 --> 00:19.735
Besides, it'll grow back.

00:20.061 --> 00:20.785
That's right.

00:21.134 --> 00:22.655
Is anybody with you at the salon?

00:23.057 --> 00:23.900
With my friend.

00:24.331 --> 00:25.477
He is waiting for me.

00:25.811 --> 00:27.742
By the way, how long is your hair?

00:28.129 --> 00:28.419
Me?

00:28.994 --> 00:30.464
I've got shoulder length hair.

00:30.724 --> 00:31.532
That's pretty.

00:31.893 --> 00:32.951
Do you have wavy hair?

00:33.173 --> 00:34.465
Yes, that's right.

00:34.951 --> 00:36.777
I think wavy hair makes you look younger.

00:37.228 --> 00:38.275
Do you think so?

00:38.764 --> 00:41.579
I thought straight hair makes you look much younger.

00:43.165 --> 00:45.621
Should I straighten my hair or not?

00:46.223 --> 00:48.885
Well, either way, I'm sure you'll look beautiful.
