Hello?

00:01.941 --> 00:02.736
Hi, Amanda.

00:02.982 --> 00:03.667
How are you?

00:04.073 --> 00:05.231
Good. How about you?

00:05.447 --> 00:06.143
I'm fine.

00:06.232 --> 00:07.180
Thank you for asking.

00:07.575 --> 00:08.542
How was your weekend?

00:09.032 --> 00:10.592
I moved into a new house.

00:10.760 --> 00:11.519
Really?

00:11.744 --> 00:12.952
Did you finish unpacking?

00:13.209 --> 00:13.895
Not yet.

00:14.110 --> 00:15.325
I'm still working on it.

00:15.531 --> 00:17.349
There must be a lot of things to do.

00:17.720 --> 00:18.264
Yes.

00:18.556 --> 00:23.464
In the morning, I vacuumed the carpet, took out the garbage, and polished the furniture.

00:23.729 --> 00:25.962
Wow. You must be tired now.

00:26.385 --> 00:27.423
Do you like your house?

00:27.592 --> 00:29.319
Yes, it's just lovely.

00:29.617 --> 00:31.146
I like its location, too.

00:31.459 --> 00:32.291
That's good.

00:32.768 --> 00:34.269
It's near a subway station.

00:34.783 --> 00:35.762
How convenient!

00:35.938 --> 00:36.363
Right.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.380
It takes only ten minutes to get to a local park.

00:39.677 --> 00:42.095
Wow! You can go jogging every morning!

00:42.337 --> 00:43.015
That's right.

00:43.369 --> 00:44.958
I'm starting from tomorrow morning.

00:45.323 --> 00:46.335
That's good for your health.

00:46.717 --> 00:48.734
That is a very nice place to live!

00:49.030 --> 00:49.605
Thank you.

00:50.111 --> 00:51.834
You should come over to my house someday.
