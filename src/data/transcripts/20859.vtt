Hello?

00:01.201 --> 00:01.923
Hi, Amanda.

00:02.381 --> 00:03.521
How are you feeling this morning?

00:04.240 --> 00:07.028
I'm tired. I can barely talk.

00:07.328 --> 00:08.125
What's wrong?

00:08.370 --> 00:10.237
I couldn't get a good night's sleep.

00:10.681 --> 00:11.331
Why not?

00:12.005 --> 00:14.252
I've just started a part-time job.

00:14.603 --> 00:16.457
Oh, what kind of job is that?

00:17.121 --> 00:20.302
I actually have two different part-time jobs.

00:20.804 --> 00:23.737
One is babysitting, and the other is tutoring.

00:24.149 --> 00:25.975
Wow, those will keep you busy.

00:26.417 --> 00:28.745
Yes, that's why I'm so tired.

00:29.213 --> 00:30.943
How old is the kid you're babysitting?

00:31.449 --> 00:33.029
I'm babysitting two kids.

00:33.502 --> 00:36.755
One is 3 years old, and the other is 5 years old.

00:37.273 --> 00:39.933
Isn't it hard to handle two of them at the same time?

00:40.415 --> 00:44.057
Yes, it can be very difficult, but they are cute.

00:44.509 --> 00:46.314
Are you also teaching them as a tutor?

00:46.795 --> 00:49.321
No, I'm tutoring a high school student.

00:49.826 --> 00:51.155
What subject are you teaching?

00:51.470 --> 00:53.162
I'm teaching mathematics.

00:53.803 --> 00:55.489
I didn't know you're good with numbers.
