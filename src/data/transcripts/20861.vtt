Hello.

00:01.849 --> 00:02.789
Hi, Amanda.

00:02.933 --> 00:03.595
What's up?

00:04.039 --> 00:05.041
Nothing much.

00:05.312 --> 00:06.795
I'm on the way home right now.

00:06.903 --> 00:07.631
Are you?

00:07.771 --> 00:09.419
Do you take the bus or subway?

00:09.867 --> 00:13.397
I take both because my house is very far from my office.

00:13.513 --> 00:15.237
How long does it take to get home?

00:15.371 --> 00:17.229
It takes about an hour.

00:17.499 --> 00:18.787
It is far!

00:18.994 --> 00:19.963
I told you.

00:20.157 --> 00:21.533
It's very tiring.

00:21.743 --> 00:22.723
How about you?

00:23.001 --> 00:24.499
It's very near my house.

00:24.719 --> 00:26.565
I walk to my office every day.

00:26.907 --> 00:28.317
I envy you.

00:28.621 --> 00:30.313
Walking is good for your health.

00:30.600 --> 00:31.463
I guess so.

00:31.993 --> 00:34.199
By the way, don't you have a car?

00:34.894 --> 00:37.697
I do, but I don't really drive much.

00:38.063 --> 00:40.161
The traffic is terrible in the morning.

00:40.466 --> 00:42.025
Can you avoid the rush hour?

00:42.224 --> 00:43.727
It's just impossible.

00:44.018 --> 00:48.096
One time, it took me three hours to get to the office!

00:48.222 --> 00:49.587
That's not good.

00:49.805 --> 00:51.430
When do you get up in the morning?

00:51.783 --> 00:54.833
I usually get up at 5:30 am.

00:55.033 --> 00:56.373
That early?

00:56.591 --> 00:57.620
For what?

00:57.841 --> 00:59.503
I work out in the morning.

00:59.765 --> 01:01.933
That's how you stay so healthy!
