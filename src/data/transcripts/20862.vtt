Hello?

00:02.149 --> 00:02.841
Hello?

00:02.975 --> 00:04.025
Hi, Amanda.

00:04.423 --> 00:05.744
Hold on a second.

00:06.090 --> 00:07.115
No problem.

00:08.069 --> 00:10.455
Sorry, I was in a library.

00:10.629 --> 00:12.456
Oh, were you studying?

00:12.575 --> 00:13.785
Yes, I was.

00:13.945 --> 00:16.688
I'm taking a very important exam soon.

00:16.849 --> 00:18.982
Oh, what kind of exam is it?

00:19.431 --> 00:21.175
It's a national exam.

00:21.417 --> 00:25.119
I want to work in public schools and I need to pass the exam.

00:25.306 --> 00:26.417
Oh, wonderful!

00:26.518 --> 00:27.862
You want to be a teacher?

00:27.970 --> 00:28.773
Since when?

00:28.979 --> 00:30.409
Not too long ago.

00:30.611 --> 00:32.138
Why do you want to be a teacher?

00:32.487 --> 00:33.474
Do you like kids?

00:33.581 --> 00:34.645
Yes, I do.

00:34.883 --> 00:37.425
Besides, my mother is a teacher, too.

00:37.891 --> 00:39.923
I think she inspired me a lot.

00:40.115 --> 00:41.515
You'll make a good teacher.

00:41.905 --> 00:43.831
Thank you for your encouragement.

00:44.084 --> 00:47.625
Besides becoming a teacher, what are you interested in trying?

00:48.137 --> 00:51.408
Actually, I wanted to be a musician, too.

00:51.669 --> 00:53.626
Can you play any musical instruments?

00:53.938 --> 00:56.355
I can play the guitar and the violin.

00:56.603 --> 00:58.006
You are very talented.
