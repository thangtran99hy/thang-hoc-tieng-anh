Few people know about this ancient forest.

00:06.657 --> 00:11.139
Maybe because the Cape is known more for its famed boats than its woodlands.

00:12.225 --> 00:15.022
Or maybe as the cities and farms expand,...

00:15.421 --> 00:18.991
...the woods came to be a resource rather than a refuge.

00:19.723 --> 00:22.491
Fortunately, Platbos forest remains,...

00:22.849 --> 00:27.686
...threatened now only by alien vegetation and our lack of knowledge.

00:29.239 --> 00:34.679
When you walk through Platbos for the first time, you feel a sense of magic.

00:35.583 --> 00:40.736
Lights streaming through the leaves of low canopy, rich forested fragrances...

00:41.152 --> 00:44.578
...and the sense that time stands still.

00:45.704 --> 00:47.951
A positive journey has begun in this forest.

00:48.627 --> 00:53.242
Every year, a tribe assembles to open their hearts and to use their hands.

00:53.713 --> 00:59.953
They come to give back to the forest its trees and to celebrate, in joy and song.

01:00.634 --> 01:03.874
Enjoy a weekend of connecting with nature and each other.

01:06.087 --> 01:06.984
Join the rhythm.

01:07.293 --> 01:10.953
Come plant trees and dance under the ancient stinkwood tree.

01:11.723 --> 01:16.039
Rediscover. Reconnect. Reforest.
