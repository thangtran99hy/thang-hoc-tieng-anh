Once you've decided the vision of your business,...

00:05.207 --> 00:09.141
...the most important thing is to find employees to help you bring that vision to life.

00:09.685 --> 00:12.219
When you're hiring employees, you need to really figure out...

00:12.299 --> 00:14.478
...what the most important trait for your company is.

00:15.040 --> 00:16.123
Wine can be intimidating.

00:16.248 --> 00:18.701
We need to have employees that are approachable to our clients.

00:19.081 --> 00:23.383
A willingness to learn is so important because it helps your employees grow within your company,...

00:23.443 --> 00:25.815
...and that ultimately helps your company to grow too.

00:26.380 --> 00:29.126
You can always teach your employees more about your product,...

00:29.379 --> 00:32.481
...but they have to have the passion within them to sell it for you.

00:33.494 --> 00:35.045
It's your business, it's your vision.

00:35.299 --> 00:38.233
You need to hire great employees that help you meet those goals.
