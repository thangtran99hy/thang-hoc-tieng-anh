Hi, there.

00:01.267 --> 00:04.297
My name's Holly and this is my human, Nancy Campbell.

00:04.397 --> 00:04.952
Sit, Holly.

00:05.412 --> 00:05.674
Sit.

00:05.782 --> 00:08.525
She's really nice and gives me lots of treats.

00:08.593 --> 00:09.259
Good girl.

00:09.519 --> 00:11.129
How are you doing, Holly?

00:11.423 --> 00:13.955
Nice to see you and your coming to visit all the children.

00:14.625 --> 00:15.691
Oh! You're a good girl.

00:16.327 --> 00:19.453
As you can clearly see, I have a really rough life.

00:19.568 --> 00:21.377
Would you like to see Holly do a trick?

00:21.945 --> 00:23.217
There she goes.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.641
What do you think about that?

00:26.205 --> 00:30.014
I get to spend quality time with some really special kids.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.755
Would you like to give Holly a treat?

00:31.998 --> 00:32.619
Okay.

00:36.049 --> 00:38.166
Now you have dog slobber on your hand, don't you?

00:40.631 --> 00:44.235
I'm trained and certified to be around little kids in the hospital.

00:44.338 --> 00:45.936
Hunter, have you seen Holly before?

00:46.041 --> 00:46.274
No.

00:46.426 --> 00:46.752
No.

00:46.833 --> 00:49.744
And I only ever get as close as they want.

00:49.875 --> 00:50.814
This is Noah.

00:51.424 --> 00:52.294
Hey, Noah!

00:52.409 --> 00:54.048
Which is sometimes pretty close.

00:55.444 --> 00:56.256
Does she need some help?

00:58.717 --> 01:00.679
Doggy hugs are my specialty.

01:01.333 --> 01:05.192
Because really generous humans like you support the children's miracle network,...

01:05.385 --> 01:08.856
...the kids at the hospital can smile a little more during their day.

01:16.050 --> 01:17.165
So give what you can....

01:17.657 --> 01:23.246
...and I promise I'll keep working hard to keep all these wonderful little patients happy.

01:24.097 --> 01:24.845
Bye, bye.

01:25.710 --> 01:26.393
Come on, Hol.

01:27.183 --> 01:27.887
We're going home.
