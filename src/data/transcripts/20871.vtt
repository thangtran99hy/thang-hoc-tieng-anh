Hello, everyone.

00:07.141 --> 00:10.533
My name is Benjamin but you can call me Uncle Ben.

00:11.080 --> 00:18.950
Zambia today is one of the highest deforestation area in Africa and in the world in general.

00:19.561 --> 00:25.727
We are, therefore, trying to work with Greenpop to see if there is something that can be done.

00:25.922 --> 00:32.769
In 2012, Greenpop came to Livingstone in Zambia to set up a conference...

00:33.200 --> 00:36.023
...on what we called "Trees for Zambia".

00:37.098 --> 00:39.032
The event was very successful.

00:39.617 --> 00:42.087
We had people from all over the globe.

00:42.702 --> 00:49.857
And we really enjoyed ourselves because we're everywhere, in schools, in communities, in farms,...

00:50.251 --> 00:52.289
...and we planted a lot of trees.

00:53.131 --> 00:59.209
Greenpop is again organizing this year from 7th to 28th of July.

00:59.989 --> 01:06.169
And this time, we hope to have a lot of you come along to join us in Livingstone...

01:06.661 --> 01:09.463
...which is the home of the mighty Victoria Falls.

01:10.093 --> 01:15.776
We are all welcoming you to this event and I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself.

01:16.473 --> 01:20.371
Let's come together and find a solution to the deforestation...

01:20.457 --> 01:22.272
...that is taking place in Livingstone.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.233
You're welcome, all of you.

01:24.677 --> 01:26.689
So please come along and join us.

01:27.091 --> 01:29.165
Let's all say, "Treevolution".

01:29.763 --> 01:30.151
Thank you.
