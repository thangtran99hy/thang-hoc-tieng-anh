Studies have suggested that we spend as much as half of our hours awake lost in a daydream.

00:10.447 --> 00:13.171
A computer model recently revealed some pretty interesting things...

00:13.238 --> 00:15.959
...about what's happening when we're mentally a million miles away.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.391
For one, parts of the brain shut off.

00:18.792 --> 00:21.903
While it often has to pick between its analytic and empathetic modes,...

00:22.194 --> 00:25.160
...which one is employed is usually determined by the task at hand.

00:25.763 --> 00:28.991
Daydreaming, on the other hand, allows the brain to cycle on its own...

00:29.224 --> 00:32.867
...and eventually both the analytic and empathetic aspects are disengaged.

00:33.485 --> 00:36.081
The brain also determines the structure of the mental getaways.

00:36.442 --> 00:39.433
While it makes sense to think that daydreams are controlled by our consciousness,...

00:39.578 --> 00:42.055
...it's actually fluctuations in the brain's neural networks.

00:42.617 --> 00:45.871
Another phenomenon about the experience is that waking dreams...

00:46.069 --> 00:48.790
...help people free up previously frozen and tucked away information,...

00:49.015 --> 00:52.558
...paving the way for new associations and possible solutions to problems.

00:52.888 --> 00:55.755
An unfortunate side effect is that upon the return to reality,...

00:56.027 --> 00:59.193
...memories of what was going on prior to departure are often lost.

00:59.527 --> 01:03.520
Oddly, the further we mentally travel in time or space, the more we forget.
