Coffee tables are no longer just slabs of wood made for feet to rest upon.

00:06.079 --> 00:09.255
Instead, many furniture designers are choosing to incorporate art...

00:09.369 --> 00:11.347
...into the once standard living room staple.

00:12.046 --> 00:16.255
A French interior designer has created a coffee table which performs double duty...

00:16.446 --> 00:18.194
...as it also serves as a birdcage.

00:18.713 --> 00:23.631
While the table itself is somewhat traditional, constructed of solid wood and standing on four legs,...

00:23.917 --> 00:26.805
...three clear vessels emerge from the furniture piece's tabletop.

00:27.597 --> 00:31.472
Underneath that same surface is additional space comprised of see-through glass...

00:31.637 --> 00:34.356
...which encompasses about half the length of the coffee table.

00:34.946 --> 00:37.068
These areas are solely for the birds.

00:37.949 --> 00:41.867
Fake tree branches which are made from steel can be seen inside of the glass,...

00:41.981 --> 00:43.578
...giving the birds a place to perch.

00:44.253 --> 00:47.959
The branches are coated with polyester putty, giving it a real-life look...

00:48.131 --> 00:50.981
...and softening the constructed material for the birds' comfort.

00:51.767 --> 00:56.631
The designer stated, "The idea was to develop a cage that would break conventional codes."

00:56.879 --> 00:58.601
"The bird is staged as in a theater."

00:59.201 --> 00:59.989
What do you think?

01:00.721 --> 01:01.747
Do you like the table?
