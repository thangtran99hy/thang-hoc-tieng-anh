Hello everyone, Neal Browne with Bill Decker in the International Business Minute.

00:03.752 --> 00:06.584
Bill, a lot of people have their company, they want to expand overseas,...

00:06.881 --> 00:10.172
...they have the best intentions but they make a lot of American faux pas,...

00:10.243 --> 00:11.529
...not even knowing what they're doing.

00:11.791 --> 00:13.166
That's right, Neal, I'm making one right now.

00:13.699 --> 00:17.305
If you look at the way I'm sitting, I'm pointing the bottom of my foot directly at you,...

00:17.763 --> 00:21.771
...which throughout the Muslim world, throughout the Buddhist world and several African countries,...

00:22.243 --> 00:27.583
...this is the dirtiest and most unclean part of the body and I'm pointing it directly at you.

00:27.915 --> 00:30.179
Offending you, it's tantamount to cursing you out.

00:30.454 --> 00:33.013
And Americans would just say, "I'm getting comfortable, I'm crossing my legs".

00:33.157 --> 00:33.947
"What's the big deal?"

00:34.003 --> 00:35.659
Well, exactly, and culture is that way.

00:35.765 --> 00:37.396
Culture is very personal, culture is very local.

00:37.623 --> 00:40.301
Here's another one: the two-handed handshake which we do in America...

00:40.377 --> 00:42.733
...to show how much we appreciate meeting people.

00:42.848 --> 00:43.102
Yes.

00:43.450 --> 00:46.921
In the Muslim world and the same world I mentioned, this is the bathroom hand.

00:47.492 --> 00:48.836
This is the hand we use in the bathroom.

00:48.896 --> 00:51.774
So by ingratiating myself to you and touching you,...

00:51.832 --> 00:55.327
...I've actually nauseated you and hurt my chances of doing business.

00:55.451 --> 00:58.719
So Americans don't even know that they're making insults all the time...

00:59.115 --> 01:00.165
...without them being conscious.

01:00.225 --> 01:01.454
And advice is available.

01:01.658 --> 01:02.781
And very good advice to know.

01:03.338 --> 01:05.698

01:05.785 --> 01:06.558
We'll see you next time.
