Hello everyone.

00:00.815 --> 00:03.048
Neal Browne with Bill Decker in the International Business Minute.

00:03.439 --> 00:06.567
Bill, in America, we speak English, we also speak American,...

00:06.681 --> 00:09.415
...which is sort of a lot of colloquialisms and figures of speech.

00:09.692 --> 00:11.273
They don't understand that internationally.

00:11.469 --> 00:11.693
No.

00:11.807 --> 00:14.599
When you say, "This is going off the wall" and...

00:14.683 --> 00:18.126
..."The person took the project belly up and we ran it up the flagpole"...

00:18.183 --> 00:21.177
...and "We needed a ballpark figure" and "Let's dance with them"...

00:21.239 --> 00:22.710
...and "Let's get into bed with that company"...

00:23.011 --> 00:25.554
...no, most cultures do not understand what we mean by that,...

00:25.747 --> 00:27.451
...and Americans make that mistake all the time.

00:27.595 --> 00:28.124
All the time.

00:28.762 --> 00:32.105
Sports analogies are very vague when we ask for a ballpark figure or we hit a home run...

00:32.363 --> 00:36.081
...or we can't get to first base, these are all analogies that...

00:36.187 --> 00:38.373
...unless you grew up here, you just don't understand what they mean.

00:38.751 --> 00:41.340
And so, what does that mean for international business when people do that?

00:42.100 --> 00:43.739
It shows, once again, cultural insensitivity.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.729
It's almost like having bad grammar.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.581
One I used to use all the time is "ain't."

00:49.095 --> 00:50.708
Europeans hate the word "ain't."

00:50.936 --> 00:53.755
It sounds cute, but "ain't" is not correct English,...

00:54.130 --> 00:56.235
...so when we say "I ain't gonna do that!", it offends.

00:56.802 --> 00:58.661
And that sinks your business chances potentially.

00:58.727 --> 00:59.897
You ain't gonna get the deal.

01:00.325 --> 01:01.433
Okay, good thing to know.

01:01.823 --> 01:03.889
Neal Browne with Bill Decker in the International Business Minute.

01:03.969 --> 01:04.706
We'll see you next time.
