Lose your smartphone?

00:01.894 --> 00:07.944
Professor Masatoshi Ishikawa from the University of Tokyo says those days are numbered.

00:08.447 --> 00:11.519
He's developing interactive projection technology...

00:11.593 --> 00:15.099
...that will keep mobile devices close at hand literally.

00:18.247 --> 00:22.852
I think it will be such that we could just open our palms and that can become the smartphone...

00:23.270 --> 00:27.811
...or we could even be notified of an incoming e-mail just by stretching out our arms.

00:31.146 --> 00:35.881
The system comprises tracking technology, computer vision and rotational mirrors...

00:36.233 --> 00:41.368
...that ensure a projected image always stays centered on its target in three-dimensional space.

00:43.488 --> 00:46.320
The technology is based on high-speed motion tracking...

00:46.762 --> 00:49.716
...which is about tracking the world faster than the human eye can.

00:50.307 --> 00:53.809
By doing that, humans won't even know they're being assisted by technology.

00:56.241 --> 00:59.057
The computer will not only keep a keypad in position,...

00:59.517 --> 01:03.417
...it will sense finger movement on individual numbers and dial them for you.

01:04.129 --> 01:08.157
But Ishikawa also wants people to actually feel the projections.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.691
So, he fitted the system with oscillators...

01:10.771 --> 01:14.137
...that beam ultrasonic waves along with the projected image.

01:14.474 --> 01:19.233
The waves generate pressure on the skin much like the tactile sensation people feel...

01:19.302 --> 01:21.731
...when pressing buttons on a smartphone screen.

01:22.170 --> 01:27.058
The research team is now focused on bringing the system out of the lab and into the real world...

01:27.463 --> 01:30.970
...with the hopes of developing a commercial product within a decade.
