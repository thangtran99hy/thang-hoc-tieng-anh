Normally, we think of using water to put out a fire.

00:11.390 --> 00:14.498
But in this video, you'll learn how to use water to start them.

00:30.604 --> 00:34.716
If you're ever lost in a survival situation, here's a little trick you're gonna be so glad to know.

00:35.281 --> 00:38.819
To practice this technique, we'll use three sheets of paper and a water bottle.

00:39.419 --> 00:41.505
Paper with black ink is easy to practice with.

00:41.681 --> 00:44.353
So let's get started making this top sheet into a platform...

00:44.427 --> 00:46.512
...by folding it in half three different ways.

00:47.108 --> 00:49.120
The black ink is showing and that's a good thing.

00:49.245 --> 00:52.633
So now, we can prepare these other two sheets by cutting or ripping them in half.

00:53.150 --> 00:54.527
This gives us four pieces...

00:54.623 --> 00:57.263
...and we can fold each of them in half so that they're creased down the middle.

00:57.709 --> 00:58.901
All right, time for the action.

00:59.178 --> 01:01.147
We'll need to remove the label from this little bottle...

01:01.237 --> 01:05.431
...and use the convex edge as a makeshift magnifying glass to focus the sunlight.

01:06.021 --> 01:10.470
It only takes a few seconds to get this paper smoking and pretty soon, we've got it smoldering.

01:10.981 --> 01:15.141
When the hole is about the size of a quarter, we'll need to slowly add multiple layers of papers.

01:15.567 --> 01:18.331
Swinging it around gently will help the air get to the embers...

01:18.449 --> 01:20.757
...and when they get hot enough, a flame appears.

01:21.227 --> 01:23.119
That's it in a nutshell, but in practice,...

01:23.201 --> 01:25.415
...you'll probably find that it's not quite as easy as it looks.
