00:06.599 --> 00:09.478
Coffee: It's the lifeblood of your average day.

00:09.954 --> 00:14.161
Grind the beans, load the filter, add water, brew and enjoy.

00:14.624 --> 00:17.549
But do you know what's inside that cup of coffee you're drinking?

00:18.084 --> 00:21.354
Mostly it's water, over 98 percent of a cup.

00:22.047 --> 00:24.729
But the other two percent is the really good stuff.

00:25.732 --> 00:28.068
The first thing you notice is the aroma.

00:28.683 --> 00:30.577
Actually, some of the compounds in coffee...

00:30.686 --> 00:33.983
...would be pretty repulsive if they were present in higher concentrations,...

00:34.173 --> 00:38.122
...like 2-Ethylphenol, which has a tar-like medicinal odor.

00:38.772 --> 00:41.005
It also happens to be a cockroach pheromone.

00:41.306 --> 00:43.399
The bugs use it to warn each other of danger.

00:43.922 --> 00:46.125
There's also dimethyl disulfide.

00:46.285 --> 00:48.661
It's just barely detectable in your cup of joe,...

00:48.962 --> 00:51.763
...which is lucky since it smells a bit like rotting meat.

00:52.137 --> 00:55.226
But of course, coffee still tastes pretty darn good.

00:55.754 --> 00:58.862
Rich acetylmethylcarbinol lends a buttery taste.

00:59.166 --> 01:01.970
No surprise since it's a component of actual butter.

01:02.443 --> 01:05.900
Trigonelline gives coffee its sweet, earthy taste....

01:06.325 --> 01:10.493
...and it also battles cavity-causing bacterium Streptococcus mutans,...

01:10.886 --> 01:13.021
...keeping the critters from attaching to your teeth.

01:13.632 --> 01:17.760
But the real health superstar is 3,5 dicaffeoylquinic acid...

01:18.085 --> 01:20.567
...which protects your brain from free radical damage.

01:21.090 --> 01:21.700
That's right.

01:22.069 --> 01:23.691
Coffee is an antioxidant.

01:24.499 --> 01:28.876
Once you've had a few slugs, your favorite ingredient kicks in, caffeine.

01:29.247 --> 01:32.583
It's actually an alkaloid plant toxin like nicotine and cocaine.

01:32.863 --> 01:34.235
But don't let that scare you.

01:34.632 --> 01:38.504
In your brain, it blocks receptors for the neurotransmitter adenosine.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.622
Result: you, awake.

01:41.003 --> 01:42.263
Want milk and sugar with that?

01:42.757 --> 01:44.545
Well, that's a whole other episode.
