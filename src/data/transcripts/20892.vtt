Actually, I didn't try to solve the development problem that we had.

00:06.550 --> 00:09.543
Brand new hardware, brand new software, you're testing the stuff out,...

00:09.900 --> 00:10.891
...it would hang up all the time.

00:11.323 --> 00:14.631
So the only solution you have is to turn the power off, wait a few seconds,...

00:14.900 --> 00:18.725
...turn the power back on, and wait for it to go through the power-on self test.

00:18.793 --> 00:22.877
I said, "I'm writing all these codes for the keyboard, let's just shortcut it."

00:23.343 --> 00:26.934
I originally intended for it to be what we would now call an Easter egg,...

00:27.250 --> 00:30.105
...just something we were using in development, it wouldn't be available elsewhere.

00:30.319 --> 00:32.109
But then the pubs people found out about it,...

00:32.400 --> 00:33.933
...and they're trying to figure out how to tell somebody...

00:34.200 --> 00:36.626
...to start up one of their programs and they had the answer,...

00:36.900 --> 00:41.005
...just put the diskette in, hit ctrl+alt+delete, and by magic your program starts.

00:41.573 --> 00:44.701
So it was like a five-minute job in doing it,...

00:44.785 --> 00:47.626
...I didn't realize that I was gonna create a cultural icon when I did it.

00:49.431 --> 00:51.351
But I have to share the credit.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.931
I may have invented it, but I think Bill made it famous.
