Waiters and waitresses take orders and serve food...

00:10.706 --> 00:13.707
...in restaurants, coffee shops, and other establishments.

00:13.797 --> 00:18.742
The quality of service they deliver helps determine whether or not the patron will return.

00:19.423 --> 00:21.565
That's because service sells.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.866
The food may be completely ordinary,...

00:24.199 --> 00:27.107
...but if the waiters and waitresses are friendly and attentive,...

00:27.417 --> 00:29.709
...customers will come back again and again.

00:30.320 --> 00:35.067
Job opportunities can range from local diners to national chains...

00:35.263 --> 00:38.871
...to expensive restaurants in major cities and resort areas.

00:39.301 --> 00:42.053
The key to success is always the same:...

00:42.447 --> 00:44.657
...put yourself in the customer's shoes.

00:45.287 --> 00:49.347
Tips are a major share of the take-home pay of a waiter or waitress,...

00:49.727 --> 00:51.761
...and the ones who receive the biggest tips...

00:51.984 --> 00:54.317
...are the ones who make their customers feel special...

00:54.633 --> 00:58.859
...by anticipating their wants and needs before they have to ask for anything.

00:59.345 --> 01:02.338
In addition, depending on the type of restaurant,...

01:02.485 --> 01:05.570
...waiters and waitresses may perform additional duties...

01:05.739 --> 01:09.435
...that are generally associated with other food and beverage occupations,...

01:09.695 --> 01:14.112
...such as escorting guests to tables, setting up or clearing tables,...

01:14.239 --> 01:16.021
...or operating the cash register.

01:16.736 --> 01:21.867
Waiting tables isn't just about serving food; it's about serving people.
