When you think of natural resources, maybe you think of forests, minerals or fertile soil.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.842
Plants and animals can be precious resources too,...

00:10.236 --> 00:15.096
...especially in regions with undeveloped rainforests like parts of Central America...

00:15.612 --> 00:18.047
...or unique animals like East Africa.

00:19.282 --> 00:22.704
But protecting these plants and animals is a big challenge.

00:23.265 --> 00:25.259
Take the example of East Africa.

00:26.038 --> 00:29.404
Many East African animals face the threat of poachers,...

00:29.729 --> 00:35.267
...people who steal animals to sell to collectors or kill them for their tusks or hides.

00:36.695 --> 00:42.493
In addition, animals require land resources that people could use for farming or houses.

00:44.169 --> 00:50.119
Protecting wildlife and setting aside land for animals to roam and graze is expensive,...

00:50.855 --> 00:54.521
...and the nations of East Africa don't have any extra money.

00:55.232 --> 01:01.107
So how can a country protect its wildlife resources and generate money and jobs for people?

01:01.809 --> 01:04.649
The answer in part is ecotourism.

01:05.602 --> 01:08.889
Ecotourism is a growing trend in the tourist industry.

01:09.448 --> 01:14.359
Tourists spend their vacation with wildlife in the animals' natural habitat.

01:15.125 --> 01:18.505
The money the tourists spend helps the host country's economy...

01:18.999 --> 01:23.667
...and helps the host country acquire the money it needs to protect its wildlife.
