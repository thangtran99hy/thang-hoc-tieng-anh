00:05.385 --> 00:08.291
This is the sleepy island of St. Kitts in the Caribbean.

00:13.160 --> 00:17.348
300 years ago, vervet monkeys were brought here from West Africa,...

00:17.411 --> 00:19.726
...along with slaves serving the rum industry.

00:21.555 --> 00:27.339
Escaped monkeys acquired a taste for alcohol by eating fermented sugarcane left in the fields.

00:28.747 --> 00:32.599
Today, they satisfy their thirst by raiding local bars.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.495
They have learned to be sneaky.

00:39.692 --> 00:41.645
Picking the right moment is everything.

00:55.269 --> 01:00.167
For years, the monkeys have been studied for insights into our own drinking habits.

01:04.752 --> 01:08.901
Just as we vary in our taste for alcohol, so do the monkeys.

01:12.261 --> 01:14.901
Some do anything for an alcoholic cocktail.

01:24.341 --> 01:28.442
But just as some people are teetotalers, so are some monkeys.

01:30.642 --> 01:33.536
These reject alcohol in favor of soft drink.

01:41.313 --> 01:44.585
Significantly, the percentage of teetotal monkeys...

01:44.935 --> 01:47.574
...matches the nondrinkers in the human population.

01:54.981 --> 01:58.683
In line with human habits, most drink in moderation.

01:59.130 --> 02:03.407
12% are steady drinkers, and 5% drink to the last drop.

02:08.249 --> 02:13.937
This similarity between us shows that a liking for alcohol is determined mainly by our genes.

02:23.621 --> 02:28.339
After each daily raid, other human parallels soon appear.

02:35.721 --> 02:41.667
But unlike us, monkeys that are heavy drinkers make better leaders, respected by other monkeys.

02:48.162 --> 02:50.991
They seem to tolerate leaders that monkey around.

02:57.109 --> 03:02.799
Like monkeys, our taste for alcohol began when we scoured the forest for ripe fermenting fruit.

03:08.533 --> 03:12.027
Food and alcohol became linked with intoxicating effect.
