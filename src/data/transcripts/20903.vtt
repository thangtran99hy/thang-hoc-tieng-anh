00:00.440 --> 00:04.014
Like all of you, I was shocked and saddened by the deaths of several young people...

00:04.109 --> 00:08.429
...who were bullied and taunted for being gay, and who ultimately took their own lives.

00:09.297 --> 00:12.177
As a parent of two daughters, it breaks my heart.

00:12.821 --> 00:14.916
And it's something that just shouldn't happen in this country.

00:16.193 --> 00:20.667
And we've got to dispel this myth that bullying is just a normal rite of passage,...

00:21.339 --> 00:23.811
...that it's some inevitable part of growing up.

00:24.605 --> 00:25.113
It's not.

00:26.007 --> 00:30.539
We have an obligation to ensure that our schools are safe for all of our kids.

00:31.641 --> 00:36.253
And to every young person out there, you need to know that if you're in trouble,...

00:36.673 --> 00:38.571
...there are caring adults who can help.

00:39.848 --> 00:43.293
I don't know what it's like to be picked on for being gay,...

00:43.453 --> 00:47.777
...but I do know what it's like to grow up feeling that sometimes you don't belong.

00:48.705 --> 00:49.169
It's tough.

00:50.049 --> 00:53.901
And for a lot of kids, the sense of being alone or apart,...

00:54.506 --> 00:55.736
...I know it can just wear on you.

00:56.241 --> 01:01.440
And when you're teased or bullied, it can seem like somehow you brought it on yourself...

01:01.722 --> 01:04.688
...for being different or for not fitting in with everybody else.

01:05.417 --> 01:08.188
But what I want to say is this, you are not alone.

01:09.061 --> 01:10.132
You didn't do anything wrong.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.957
You didn't do anything to deserve being bullied.

01:13.769 --> 01:17.369
And there is a whole world waiting for you, filled with possibilities.

01:17.957 --> 01:21.838
There are people out there who love you and care about you just the way you are.

01:22.639 --> 01:27.987
And so if you ever feel like because of bullying, because of what people are saying...

01:28.437 --> 01:29.788
...that you're getting down on yourself,...

01:30.286 --> 01:32.745
...you've got to make sure to reach out to people you trust.

01:33.314 --> 01:39.675
Whether it's your parents, teachers; folks that you know care about you just the way you are,...

01:39.987 --> 01:41.090
...you've got to reach out to them.

01:41.681 --> 01:43.867
Don't feel like you're in this by yourself.

01:45.247 --> 01:47.792
The other thing you need to know is things will get better.

01:48.454 --> 01:51.810
And more than that, with time you're going to see that your differences...

01:52.233 --> 01:54.432
...are a source of pride and a source of strength.

01:55.295 --> 02:00.133
You'll look back on the struggles you've faced with compassion and wisdom...

02:00.397 --> 02:05.048
...and that's not just going to serve you, but it'll help you get involved...

02:05.130 --> 02:06.511
...and make this country a better place.

02:07.767 --> 02:11.005
It'll mean that you'll be more likely to help fight discrimination...

02:11.537 --> 02:16.326
...not just against LGBT Americans, but discrimination in all its forms.

02:17.151 --> 02:20.649
That means you'll be more likely to understand personally and deeply why...

02:20.974 --> 02:24.845
...it's so important that as adults, we set an example in our own lives...

02:24.937 --> 02:27.150
...and that we treat everybody with respect,...

02:27.678 --> 02:32.149
...that we are able to see the world through other people's eyes and stand in their shoes,...

02:32.771 --> 02:35.544
...that we never lose sight of what binds us together.

02:36.474 --> 02:39.503
As a nation, we're founded on the belief that all of us are equal...

02:39.592 --> 02:43.467
...and each of us deserves the freedom to pursue our own version of happiness,...

02:43.808 --> 02:47.870
...to make the most of our talents, to speak our minds, to not fit in.

02:49.095 --> 02:51.235
Most of all, to be true to ourselves.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.946
That's the freedom that enriches all of us.

02:54.073 --> 02:55.259
That's what America is all about.

02:56.241 --> 02:58.067
And every day, it gets better.
