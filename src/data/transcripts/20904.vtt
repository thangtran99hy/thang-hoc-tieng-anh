00:00.414 --> 00:03.917
We searched the world for different brands, different companies...

00:04.305 --> 00:07.161
...that make the highest quality of this type of furniture.

00:07.798 --> 00:12.826
In addition to beds, we have many different product lines and types of furniture.

00:13.481 --> 00:16.339
We have a new product which is the transformable ottoman,...

00:16.523 --> 00:21.285
It's your essential ottoman and it's on small wheels so it's easy to move around.

00:21.731 --> 00:26.681
And the entire ottoman deconstructs itself and turns into five different stools.

00:27.829 --> 00:30.147
The next new item we have is the Goliath's table.

00:30.449 --> 00:37.197
It's like an aluminum bridge and the table extends from 17 inches deep to 10 feet deep...

00:37.546 --> 00:39.309
...and seats 12 to 14 people.

00:39.449 --> 00:41.973
Now, this space that can be dedicated to something...

00:42.059 --> 00:44.785
...it is actually functional day in and day out.

00:45.174 --> 00:47.255
We have a new system, it's called the Poppi board.

00:47.488 --> 00:51.982
It's unique because, first you have in a one single seven foot space,...

00:52.356 --> 00:56.309
...you have hanging closet or shelf closet whichever you prefer.

00:56.397 --> 00:59.671
It's two feet deep so you can hang seven feet of clothing in it...

01:00.057 --> 01:03.627
...and the same space that you would put this closet you also have a bed.

01:04.067 --> 01:06.302
Aside from the bed, you have a seven foot desk and then...

01:06.614 --> 01:09.481
...behind the bed, when you open the bed, you have 14 feet of shelving.

01:10.206 --> 01:15.259
In seven feet by three feet deep, you've got an entire room.
