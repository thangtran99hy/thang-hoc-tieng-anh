This man right here is my great-grandfather.

00:02.329 --> 00:03.955
He's the first cat herder in our family.

00:06.721 --> 00:09.913
Herding cats: don't let anybody tell you it's easy.

00:11.939 --> 00:13.125
Anybody can herd cattle.

00:13.525 --> 00:18.117
Holding together 10,000 half wild short hairs, now that's another thing altogether.

00:18.600 --> 00:22.441
Being a cat herder is probably about the toughest thing I think I've ever done.

00:22.857 --> 00:25.298
I got this one this morning, right here.

00:25.847 --> 00:30.357
And if you look at his face, it's just ripped to shreds, you know.

00:30.859 --> 00:33.176
You see the movies, you hear the stories,...

00:35.299 --> 00:36.231
...I'm living a dream.

00:36.999 --> 00:38.661
Not everyone can do what we do.

00:39.426 --> 00:40.745
I wouldn't do nothing else.

00:41.491 --> 00:45.605
It ain't an easy job but when you bring a herd into town and you ain't lost one of them,...

00:46.191 --> 00:47.660
...ain't a feeling like it in the world.
