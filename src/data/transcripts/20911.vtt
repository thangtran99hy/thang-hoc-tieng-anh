00:01.720 --> 00:02.292
Bad dog.

00:03.557 --> 00:04.119
Bad home.

00:05.345 --> 00:05.996
Bad owner.

00:06.082 --> 00:07.032
Shut up!

00:11.195 --> 00:11.939
Bad treatment.

00:12.835 --> 00:13.451
I need to look at her.

00:13.978 --> 00:16.097
What do you need to examine her for you're not a doctor.

00:16.773 --> 00:18.024
That's careless.

00:19.491 --> 00:20.040
Bad health.

00:22.307 --> 00:22.987
Bad bed.

00:23.978 --> 00:24.659
Bad food.

00:27.850 --> 00:29.503
Let me have a look at this leg.

00:32.195 --> 00:32.752
Good food.

00:34.207 --> 00:34.794
Good bed.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.221
Mojo, come on.

00:37.616 --> 00:38.112
Stay.

00:38.179 --> 00:38.805
Good health.

00:39.332 --> 00:39.974
Come on, Mojo.

00:42.336 --> 00:43.081
Good treatment.

00:46.591 --> 00:47.310
Good owner.

00:48.527 --> 00:49.333
Good home.

00:50.527 --> 00:51.282
Good dog.

00:52.539 --> 00:56.145
For rescued dogs, the right nutrition is the first step to a brighter future.

00:56.469 --> 00:58.923
So we're donating one million meals this year.
