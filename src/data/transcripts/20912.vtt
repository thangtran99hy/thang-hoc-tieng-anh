Coolhaus is an architecturally-themed ice cream sandwich company.

00:07.594 --> 00:10.241
Our sandwiches are made-to-order on our trucks.

00:10.469 --> 00:13.409
We use technology like Twitter, Facebook and Foursquare...

00:13.466 --> 00:18.614
...to get the word out to all our customers and with 13,000 Twitter followers...

00:18.786 --> 00:22.787
...we're able to actually sell a lot of ice cream sandwiches and grow.

00:24.435 --> 00:31.315
We disseminate information to everyone in our staff in LA and also Austin and in New York.

00:31.556 --> 00:33.685
So things like our standard operating procedures...

00:33.741 --> 00:37.020
...to how to tweet out our location is all in this one hub.

00:37.658 --> 00:41.033
Yeah, mobile technology makes sense for us because we are a mobile business...

00:41.112 --> 00:43.985
...and there's not one location that is Coolhaus.

00:44.349 --> 00:49.868
So having a mobile device that contains all of these documents and all these information...

00:49.941 --> 00:53.108
...in one consolidated place that people can then take with them on the road.

00:53.545 --> 01:00.145
I honestly don't think our business would be as successful without the technology that we use.
