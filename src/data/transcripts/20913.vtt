Malnutrition may not make headlines like a famine does...

00:03.121 --> 00:06.085
...but not having proper nutrients can be just as deadly.

00:06.741 --> 00:09.415
You see, hunger isn't just a stomach thing.

00:09.816 --> 00:14.159
It affects every part of the body and these effects can last for a lifetime.

00:14.961 --> 00:18.878
For instance, a healthy brain uses 20% of the body's energy...

00:19.122 --> 00:20.341
...and that energy comes from?

00:20.738 --> 00:22.011
You guessed it, food.

00:22.694 --> 00:25.779
When a child is hungry the brain is starved, the result?

00:26.415 --> 00:30.061
Malnourished kids fall behind in school because they can't concentrate.

00:30.693 --> 00:32.977
Skin and bones are also affected by nutrition.

00:33.633 --> 00:37.431
Healthy skin is like armor, shielding the body from infection.

00:37.979 --> 00:40.853
And healthy bones get bigger and stronger as a child grows.

00:41.588 --> 00:44.517
But when a child is malnourished, their skin cracks...

00:44.915 --> 00:46.401
...allowing infections to get in.

00:47.694 --> 00:49.745
We need to catch hunger before it starts...

00:50.175 --> 00:54.273
...by making sure kids aren't just getting enough food, but the right food...

00:54.905 --> 00:58.348
...so that they have the best possible chance at a healthy, successful life.
