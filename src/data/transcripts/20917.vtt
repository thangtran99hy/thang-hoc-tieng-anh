00:00.050 --> 00:05.263
So you are relatively poor while other people seem to be incredibly rich.

00:05.736 --> 00:10.027
But getting rich seems like a mysteriously complicated feat, right?

00:10.784 --> 00:14.028
Maybe win the lottery someday, become a movie star,...

00:14.430 --> 00:19.873
...or maybe end up in the right place at the right time and get that once in a lifetime opportunity.

00:20.285 --> 00:22.712
Otherwise you're just good at being poor.

00:23.118 --> 00:24.273
Hey, here's the thing.

00:24.500 --> 00:27.113
Becoming rich is very similar to becoming poor.

00:27.502 --> 00:29.936
See, the way you get poor is like this.

00:30.241 --> 00:32.673
You work hard and buy things that take money out of your pocket.

00:33.441 --> 00:37.306
These are what richy pants financial people call liabilities.

00:37.528 --> 00:41.890
And if you keep acquiring these liabilities, eventually you will be poor.

00:42.187 --> 00:42.997
Guaranteed.

00:43.435 --> 00:45.549
Now, becoming rich is pretty similar.

00:45.849 --> 00:48.338
You still work hard, you still buy things,...

00:48.465 --> 00:51.604
...except you buy things that put money in your pocket.

00:51.869 --> 00:53.029
Things like real estate.

00:53.262 --> 00:54.090
Businesses.

00:54.211 --> 00:54.839
Stock.

00:55.105 --> 00:56.686
Things called assets.

00:57.021 --> 00:59.957
And assets generate money for you even when you're not working...

01:00.314 --> 01:02.951
...which grows exponentially with the more assets you buy.

01:03.325 --> 01:07.543
And if you keep buying these assets, soon you will be rich.
