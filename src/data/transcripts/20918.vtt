Fresh-baked bread, chocolate chip cookies and freshly-mown grass.

00:05.937 --> 00:10.142
For sure, at least one of these things reminds you of a pleasant memory and more importantly, a pleasant smell.

00:10.337 --> 00:12.588
Hi, I'm Rebecca Brayton and welcome to WatchMojo.com...

00:12.871 --> 00:16.005
...and today we'll be looking at the connection between scent and spending.

00:16.242 --> 00:17.961
What effect does scent have on humans?

00:18.067 --> 00:22.729
So, if you ask the average person, you know, how do you think scent impacts you in a store, in a shopping mall?

00:22.831 --> 00:24.090
They think, "Oh, it must change your mood."

00:24.337 --> 00:26.699
But actually, most of the research suggests it doesn't change your mood,...

00:26.867 --> 00:28.945
...but it can make you spend more money.

00:29.087 --> 00:30.671
It can make you linger longer...

00:30.749 --> 00:36.003
...and it can impact how positively you evaluate products or the store you're in.

00:36.139 --> 00:39.962
How important is one's sense of smell to our everyday life?

00:40.114 --> 00:42.531
Most people underestimate the importance of scent.

00:42.641 --> 00:45.672
People who lose their sense of smell actually go into depression...

00:45.744 --> 00:49.188
...and they, you know, describe their world as being kind of dull and lifeless.

00:49.764 --> 00:52.025
They lose much of their sense of taste,...

00:52.125 --> 00:54.830
...because much of what we taste is actually a function of what we're smelling,...

00:54.921 --> 00:58.445
...so a lot of things that we take for granted in terms of our sense of smell,...

00:58.973 --> 01:04.523
...if it's taken away from us, then we suddenly notice it and it makes life a lot less pleasurable.

01:04.759 --> 01:06.339
Can we talk about scent and memory?

01:06.461 --> 01:13.241
Scent is very capable of enhancing our memory for associated things after a time delay.

01:13.350 --> 01:15.831
What kind of questions does the study of scent bring out?

01:15.955 --> 01:22.955
Sometimes there's this concern that marketers are like out there manipulating us by pumping in scent and stuff.

01:23.229 --> 01:26.965
And there is the potential for that because in a lot of my studies,...

01:27.035 --> 01:32.490
...what I find is the vast majority of the participants in my studies never remember having been exposed to a scent,...

01:33.485 --> 01:34.691
...and yet I find effects.

01:34.766 --> 01:37.688
There's a concern from a consumer protection point of view.

01:37.847 --> 01:39.738
Can you explain to us the idea of scent marketing?

01:39.891 --> 01:44.278
More and more retailers are trying the use of ambient scent,...

01:44.355 --> 01:48.511
...which means pumping in an odor that's not attached to one particular thing, it's just in the atmosphere.

01:48.662 --> 01:51.680
I think it's becoming a more popular marketing tactic...

01:51.749 --> 01:55.802
...or a way to enhance people's experience, you know, in the space.

01:56.041 --> 01:58.323
And where might we be seeing it eventually?

01:58.395 --> 02:01.250
It's probably in more spaces than you know now.

02:01.322 --> 02:04.859
In fact, I would encourage consumers to be conscious of their environment...

02:04.978 --> 02:09.857
...and try to notice whether they think something is being introduced in the atmosphere to make them more relaxed.

02:09.953 --> 02:12.199
What should we expect in the future from scent marketing?

02:12.415 --> 02:16.348
Going forward, we need to be conscious of people who don't like scent.

02:16.429 --> 02:17.927
They might have a physical reaction to it,...

02:18.011 --> 02:21.544
...and so we need to be really sensitive to the possibility of, you know, doing them harm.

02:21.675 --> 02:22.482
Thank you very much.

02:22.569 --> 02:23.033
You're welcome.
