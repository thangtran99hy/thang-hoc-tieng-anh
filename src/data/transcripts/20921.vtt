Today, we're gonna talk about Gwangbokjeol.

00:04.320 --> 00:06.087
Gwangbokjeol. 

00:06.539 --> 00:11.358
Gwangbokjeol literally means "Restoration of Light Day,"...

00:12.385 --> 00:18.445
...celebrated annually on August 15th as one of the public holidays in South Korea.

00:19.025 --> 00:25.201
It commemorates Victory over Japan Day which liberated Korea from colonial rule.

00:25.971 --> 00:31.753
The South Korean government was created three years later on August 13, 1948...

00:32.461 --> 00:37.805
...when Rhee Syngman was sworn in as the first President of South Korea.

00:38.282 --> 00:46.229
And Gwangbokjeol was officially designated a public holiday on October 1, 1949.

00:48.213 --> 00:53.444
The official Independence Day of South Korea is celebrated on August 15,...

00:54.281 --> 01:01.079
...although the actual day of the independence was on August 13th, 1948.

01:01.526 --> 01:05.708
The official date, which is the 15th of August 1945,...

01:05.973 --> 01:11.150
...was not the day the South Koreans attained final autonomy from Japan.

01:11.527 --> 01:18.409
It was only on the 13th of August 1948 that South Korea was fully liberated...

01:18.731 --> 01:22.339
...from any sort of outside administration.

01:22.978 --> 01:27.601
For political reasons, the first president of the country, Rhee Syngman,...

01:28.193 --> 01:35.170
...chose the 15th of August instead of the 13th as the official Independence Day of South Korea.

01:36.942 --> 01:41.623
As a public holiday, many activities and events happen during the day...

01:42.124 --> 01:48.506
...including an official ceremony with the president in attendance that takes place...

01:48.707 --> 01:57.607
...at the Independence Hall of Korea in Cheonan or at the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts.

01:58.722 --> 02:05.336
All buildings and homes are encouraged to display the national flag or Taegeukgi.

02:08.315 --> 02:13.765
And most public museums and places are open free of charge...

02:14.184 --> 02:19.422
...to the descendants of independence activists on the holiday.

02:20.203 --> 02:25.623
The official Gwangbokjeol song is sung at the official ceremony.

02:26.526 --> 02:34.694
The song's lyrics are written by Jeong Inbo and the melody by Yoon Yong-ha.

02:35.805 --> 02:42.143
The lyrics speak of "to touch the Earth again" and how "the sea dances."

02:42.897 --> 02:50.833
How "this day is the remaining traces of 40 years of passionate blood solidified"...

02:51.527 --> 02:55.179
...and to "guard us forever and ever."

02:56.097 --> 03:01.201
The government traditionally issues special pardons on Gwangbokjeol.
