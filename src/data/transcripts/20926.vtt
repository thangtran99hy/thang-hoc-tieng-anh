Today's business school bit...

00:01.646 --> 00:03.809
...is taking a look at the difference between the Chairman of the Board,...

00:04.029 --> 00:07.815
...the CEO, which is the Chief Executive Officer and the President of a company.

00:08.210 --> 00:11.835
Well, first off the Chairman of the Board is not actually a member of the executive team.

00:12.135 --> 00:16.166
He sits on the board of directors and basically represents all the shareholders of a firm.

00:16.490 --> 00:21.045
The CEO is the person who is responsible for setting out the strategic vision of the company.

00:21.266 --> 00:24.019
And finally, the President is the person that has to go out...

00:24.129 --> 00:26.798
...and on a day-to-day basis execute the business plan.

00:26.991 --> 00:29.580
So, in a nutshell, the President reports to the CEO...

00:29.808 --> 00:32.113
...and the CEO has the chairman to answer to.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.281
And that has been today's business school bit.
