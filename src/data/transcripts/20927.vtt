00:06.195 --> 00:07.649
Great weather we're having!

00:07.851 --> 00:09.167
Awesome job!

00:09.700 --> 00:11.891
You're a tremendous athlete!

00:12.835 --> 00:14.665
Compliments, right?

00:15.644 --> 00:17.180
Well, maybe.

00:18.057 --> 00:21.366
Depending on the attitude and tone of voice behind these lines,...

00:21.461 --> 00:23.631
...they very well may be compliments.

00:24.427 --> 00:27.708
They may also be, though, pointed and attacking lines.

00:28.383 --> 00:34.089
This slight change of attitude behind the lines reveals what we call "verbal irony."

00:35.351 --> 00:38.615
So when someone says, "Great weather we're having,"...

00:38.947 --> 00:41.853
...it is quite possible that person really means that...

00:42.378 --> 00:46.144
...if the sun is shining, the birds are singing and the wind is calm.

00:46.864 --> 00:51.264
But if the weather is horrible, the clouds are looming and the wind is a raging tempest,...

00:51.547 --> 00:55.263
...and someone says, "Great weather we're having,"...

00:56.038 --> 00:57.843
...he probably doesn't actually mean that.

00:58.157 --> 01:00.551
He probably means that the weather is horrible,... 

01:00.917 --> 01:02.625
...but he has said the opposite.

01:03.224 --> 01:04.884
This is verbal irony:...

01:05.333 --> 01:07.949
...when the speaker says the opposite of what he means.

01:08.365 --> 01:09.121
I know what you're thinking.

01:09.305 --> 01:10.355
Isn't this sarcasm?

01:10.587 --> 01:12.191
Isn't the speaker being sarcastic?

01:12.788 --> 01:13.217
Yes.

01:13.655 --> 01:17.865
When a speaker says the opposite of what he means, that is verbal irony.

01:18.609 --> 01:22.447
When the speaker then goes the step farther to mean the opposite of what he says...

01:22.636 --> 01:27.222
...and seeks to be a little pointed and mean, like he's making fun of something,...

01:27.464 --> 01:28.664
...then you have sarcasm.
