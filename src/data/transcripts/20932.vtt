00:00.247 --> 00:05.325
So this is an area of interest to me and my lab's been studying this for a while,...

00:06.023 --> 00:09.928
...is why time is rubbery and can speed up or slow down.

00:10.216 --> 00:16.804
And, the experiment had never been done about why time seems to move in slow motion...

00:16.902 --> 00:19.391
...when you're in a life threatening situation.

00:19.919 --> 00:25.203
But I talked to so many people and I'd experienced it myself that I wanted to study that.

00:25.283 --> 00:30.682
So I found a way to study it by dropping people from 150 foot tall tower...

00:31.024 --> 00:33.341
...and measuring their time perception on the way down.

00:33.795 --> 00:36.752
And that, plus several other experiments we did in my lab,...

00:37.516 --> 00:42.974
...led me to understand that people don't actually see time in slow motion during an event.

00:43.059 --> 00:46.415
Instead, it's a completely retrospective assessment.

00:46.493 --> 00:49.292
In other words, when you're in a life threatening situation,...

00:49.608 --> 00:52.259
...your brain writes down memory much more densely,...

00:52.784 --> 00:57.807
...and then retrospectively, when you look at that, you have so many details that you don't normally have...

00:58.125 --> 01:00.968
...that it seems as though it must have lasted a very long time.

01:01.051 --> 01:03.466
That's the only interpretation your brain can make.

01:03.737 --> 01:07.278
So time, your assessment of how long something took,...

01:07.493 --> 01:11.839
...has a lot to do with how much energy your brain has to burn during the event...

01:11.994 --> 01:15.473
...and how much footage you have of the event.
