Fallen Fruit began in 2004,...

00:03.365 --> 00:07.252
...and what we did was we mapped the neighborhood between our houses...

00:07.471 --> 00:10.269
...for all the fruit trees that exist in public space.

00:10.403 --> 00:14.935
What we've learned is that over 100 trees existed within five city blocks...

00:15.021 --> 00:18.247
...and those trees gave organic fruit all year long.

00:18.363 --> 00:21.349
What we're really interested in is how you walk through a neighborhood...

00:21.439 --> 00:23.866
...or how you might experience something in a different way.

00:24.134 --> 00:27.941
Which is why we're very interested in using social networking and media...

00:28.021 --> 00:30.603
...along with the act of walking and picking.

00:30.765 --> 00:32.634
But these two things have to go together.

00:33.485 --> 00:36.687
Fallen Fruit is very interested in the idea of public space.

00:37.077 --> 00:39.495
And what we're really particularly excited about...

00:39.583 --> 00:42.647
...is the space between the alleys, the staircases,...

00:42.838 --> 00:44.835
...and these spaces that kind of get overlooked.

00:45.555 --> 00:49.129
And when you walk through a neighborhood and start looking at the world in a different way,...

00:49.437 --> 00:51.357
...you see how much it really has to offer.
