You are just about to upload something to the Internet,...

00:03.380 --> 00:06.253
...and suddenly, an error message on your browser pops up.

00:06.835 --> 00:10.165
You then start to panic and hit the refresh button like crazy,...

00:10.412 --> 00:12.757
...only to realize that your Internet connection is down.

00:13.355 --> 00:17.206
You call tech support, who asked you to reset both the modem and the router.

00:17.709 --> 00:18.523
That sounds easy, right?

00:19.326 --> 00:24.013
Wait, you're upstairs, and your modem and router is somewhere in the jungle below.

00:24.492 --> 00:27.777
You get your flashlight, find the right cable, unplug the modem,...

00:27.920 --> 00:30.687
...unplug the wireless router, wait for 60 seconds,...

00:31.037 --> 00:36.483
...plug in the modem, wait for the lights, then plug the wireless router and you're done.

00:37.223 --> 00:38.020
Congratulations!

00:38.457 --> 00:41.813
You then go back upstairs and hope the Internet is back online.

00:43.220 --> 00:44.785
That sure took a lot of your precious time.

00:45.487 --> 00:50.293
Why hasn't somebody invented a magic jelly bean that can fix everything with just the push of a button?

00:50.784 --> 00:51.427
Guess what?

00:51.851 --> 00:52.791
We just did.

00:53.239 --> 00:55.487
Introducing the Amazing Jelly Bean.

00:55.906 --> 00:59.143
The Amazing Jelly Bean is a device that allows you to reset your Internet connection...

00:59.229 --> 01:00.847
...with just one push of a button.

01:01.529 --> 01:04.893
You simply plug your modem and router into the magic jelly bean once.

01:05.197 --> 01:09.235
And the next time you lose your internet connection, press the button and you're done.

01:09.804 --> 01:10.819
Internet connection down?

01:11.155 --> 01:11.724
No problem.

01:12.241 --> 01:14.677
Your modem and wireless router in hard-to-reach places?

01:15.133 --> 01:15.875
No problem.

01:16.458 --> 01:17.345
Can't see this video?

01:17.986 --> 01:20.351
Then you need the Amazing Jelly Bean now.

01:20.805 --> 01:23.819
Now resetting your Internet connection is a treat.
