What is hope?

00:03.829 --> 00:07.956
Hope is when a family who had to walk miles for water now has it pumped to their village.

00:13.827 --> 00:15.408
What is joy?

00:16.909 --> 00:21.174
Joy is when a young boy from the slums goes to school for the first time.

00:29.449 --> 00:30.713
What is pride?

00:31.845 --> 00:36.491
Pride is when a child you helped to read and write sends you a letter to say thank you.

00:40.084 --> 00:43.751
You can become a World Vision child sponsor for just 60p a day.

00:44.287 --> 00:47.294

00:47.591 --> 00:49.573
