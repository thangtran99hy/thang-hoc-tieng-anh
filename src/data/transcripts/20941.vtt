00:12.527 --> 00:14.455
ï»¿Test question alert.

00:15.427 --> 00:17.346
Test question alert.

00:18.016 --> 00:19.190
Enough from the big giant head.

00:20.061 --> 00:21.577
I don't fall asleep in his class.

00:22.014 --> 00:27.175
I just don't and it's weird because I can remember falling asleep in every other class.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.125
I've never had a teacher like him at all.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.740
He's the epitome of what I think a teacher should be.

00:32.678 --> 00:33.297
That's what I was afraid of.

00:33.645 --> 00:33.895
Okay.

00:34.297 --> 00:36.206
Go ahead and go get that table for me please.

00:37.103 --> 00:38.325
Mr. Wright has a key to the city.

00:40.811 --> 00:42.280
I just tend to fall asleep a lot.

00:42.540 --> 00:44.056
It's a bad thing, but I do.

00:44.148 --> 00:48.957
But this class just keeps me interested so there's no room for napping 'cause you're learning.

00:49.074 --> 00:49.896
It's smoking!

00:51.901 --> 00:52.594
Be careful.

00:57.315 --> 00:58.909
It's like this guy is just crazy.

00:59.006 --> 01:01.008
He's just exploding with fun.

01:05.596 --> 01:09.593
School's happening for six hours a day and then they, the kids go home.

01:09.699 --> 01:14.957
And whatever atmosphere they have around for the other 18 affects them.

01:15.563 --> 01:18.526
And so schools can change a lot.

01:19.121 --> 01:23.419
But we also have to realize that they go home to a completely different environment.

01:23.701 --> 01:26.784
I think he could tell with me that I had stuff going on.

01:27.297 --> 01:28.771
So he kind of reached out to me at first.

01:29.099 --> 01:32.807
At first I was like, "Dude, you're a teacher, I'm not gonna talk to you."

01:33.953 --> 01:34.715
But I did.

01:34.846 --> 01:39.193
What I went to when I was young is very different than what some of these kids go home to,...

01:39.256 --> 01:40.841
...where they don't have a mom and dad.

01:41.449 --> 01:45.411
Or some of these kids, I hear them talk about all the time were they heard gunshots at night.

01:45.795 --> 01:49.095
I'd have a hard time sleeping or studying if I ever hear gunshots outside the room.

01:49.759 --> 01:51.544
I've pretty much been on my own since I was 15.

01:52.385 --> 01:56.792
So, yeah, I talk to him about a lot of stuff like at home and stuff and he works with me.

01:57.757 --> 02:03.203
I've had everything from, "Mr. Wright, we're pregnant" to...

02:03.579 --> 02:08.407
..."I've had an abortion" to "I've run away" and...

02:08.753 --> 02:13.685
..."Here's what I'm saying, my father is beating me and here's pictures of the holes in the walls."

02:13.779 --> 02:16.790
And you can see where the makeup is trying to cover up bruises.

02:19.817 --> 02:22.696
It's just very different than where some of the rest of us are.

02:23.593 --> 02:25.565
That's why one size fits all doesn't work.
