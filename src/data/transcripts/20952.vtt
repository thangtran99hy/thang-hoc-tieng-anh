I'm professor Larry Foulke and I teach courses in nuclear engineering at the University of Pittsburgh.

00:14.239 --> 00:16.294
Nuclear energy is relatively new.

00:16.950 --> 00:21.863
It's based on remarkable scientific discoveries made in the early 20th century.

00:22.510 --> 00:26.082
In this course, I'll introduce you to those discoveries...

00:26.192 --> 00:31.065
...and how they have been translated into a capability to generate electricity.

00:31.664 --> 00:36.337
A global resource that will increase in need as the world population grows...

00:36.745 --> 00:40.100
...to between nine and ten billion people by 2050.

00:41.248 --> 00:44.449
Now in spite of the recent event at Fukushima in Japan,...

00:45.005 --> 00:49.909
...there are over 435 nuclear reactors operating in the world today.

00:50.556 --> 00:55.707
And that population is growing with 62 reactors under construction worldwide.

00:56.265 --> 00:57.763
What exactly is nuclear energy?

00:58.295 --> 00:59.483
What is its history?

00:59.805 --> 01:01.550
Why is it so controversial?

01:02.045 --> 01:03.752
How do nuclear power plants work?

01:03.982 --> 01:05.480
What about nuclear weapons?

01:05.885 --> 01:08.452
What are the stereotypes and misconceptions?

01:09.106 --> 01:13.129
I believe that citizens everywhere need to understand nuclear energy...

01:13.443 --> 01:18.780
...so they can either recognize that it represents an immensely valuable technology...

01:19.205 --> 01:23.644
...or determine it's a threat to the health and safety of the world's population.

01:24.412 --> 01:26.963
Or perhaps the truth lies somewhere in between.
