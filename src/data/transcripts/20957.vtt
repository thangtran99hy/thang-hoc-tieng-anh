The myth of overpopulation originated in England in 1798,...

00:04.051 --> 00:07.663
...when a vicar named Thomas Malthus who fancied himself something of a mathematician,...

00:08.041 --> 00:12.329
...saw that food production increased incrementally, but people reproduced exponentially.

00:13.287 --> 00:14.866
He sat down and did some simple math...

00:15.177 --> 00:18.497
...and summarily decided that the world would be out of food by 1890.

00:18.925 --> 00:21.912
He blamed reduced mortality rates and recommended killing off...

00:22.025 --> 00:24.894
...the have-nots of society, lest the haves starve to death.

00:25.885 --> 00:30.330
This cry was taken up by Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University in 1968,...

00:30.787 --> 00:33.929
...who claimed that reckless human reproduction had overwhelmed the Earth.

00:34.641 --> 00:38.055
Massive famines would result, which would destroy, best case scenario,...

00:38.263 --> 00:40.468
...one-fifth of humanity by the end of the 70s,...

00:40.749 --> 00:41.907
...and the planet would follow.

00:42.679 --> 00:46.277
This fear produced large donations for the newly created UNFPA,...

00:46.548 --> 00:49.311
...which thrives on an imagined crisis that has been both imminent...

00:49.467 --> 00:52.545
...and rescheduled again and again over the past two centuries.

00:52.820 --> 00:57.823
The truth of the matter is that every family on this planet could have a house with a yard...

00:58.334 --> 01:00.933
...and all live together on a landmass the size of Texas,...

01:01.765 --> 01:03.553
...which is really just a small corner of the planet.

01:04.030 --> 01:08.274
The population growth will peak in 30 years and then start to go back down.

01:08.824 --> 01:09.858
We're not overpopulated.

01:10.424 --> 01:10.881
Do the math.
