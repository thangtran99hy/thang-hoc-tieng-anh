What is viral marketing?

00:02.315 --> 00:06.641
It's like a word of mouth or a buzz; sometimes it's called marketing buzz.

00:07.356 --> 00:11.475
Like, for example, you do something funny, your mother shared this with a neighbor...

00:11.608 --> 00:15.793
...and the neighbor shared it with your teacher, who in turn told his class.

00:16.136 --> 00:21.415
In less than a month, the whole city, yeah, the whole city, knows your embarrassing experience.

00:21.733 --> 00:25.313
Now, let's take out the embarrassing experience in the equation...

00:25.395 --> 00:27.543
...and replace it with your idea.

00:27.757 --> 00:30.379
Imagine how effective this kind of marketing would be.

00:31.183 --> 00:35.505
Why are people so compelled to share, for example, your embarrassing moment?

00:35.984 --> 00:36.423
It's simple.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.147
People are social.

00:38.469 --> 00:42.349
If you find something interesting, you tend to share it with your close friends...

00:42.797 --> 00:44.753
...and your friends have friends and so on.

00:45.097 --> 00:49.258
And interesting is not just limited to an "embarrassing moment."

00:49.481 --> 00:54.005
With today's internet technology, the word of mouth strategy has just gotten better.

00:54.481 --> 00:56.657
The internet has become more social than ever.

00:56.845 --> 01:01.038
With a variety of social networking sites, you are not only connected to your city...

01:01.453 --> 01:03.046
...but the whole world.

01:03.525 --> 01:06.655
To have a successful viral marketing, you need to have two things:...

01:07.037 --> 01:09.963
...the right message and the right connection.

01:10.519 --> 01:15.013
Take, for example, these two guys watching a very cool yet complicated video.

01:15.528 --> 01:19.042
Yo bro, take a look at this very cool video; cool effect, man!

01:19.408 --> 01:20.247
What's it about?

01:21.599 --> 01:24.711
Well, some cool robots.

01:25.781 --> 01:27.130
Not very useful.

01:27.305 --> 01:30.909
If this was a plainly simple video, it would have been like this.

01:31.439 --> 01:35.406
Yo bro, take a look at this cool video, I can really understand it now.

01:36.181 --> 01:38.895
Now, that's the first step in viral marketing.

01:39.245 --> 01:42.309
Second is to utilize the right connections,...

01:42.521 --> 01:44.501
...for example, posting the video on YouTube.

01:44.691 --> 01:49.411
And let's say it gets viewed by someone who, in turn, posts it in his Facebook account...

01:49.523 --> 01:53.867
...and that gets seen by a famous blogger who embeds the video in his blog...

01:54.139 --> 01:56.965
...just like how you found this video of ours.
