00:04.300 --> 00:06.288
According to believers in overpopulation,...

00:06.385 --> 00:10.193
...there are so many of us on the planet that food production cannot possibly keep up.

00:11.919 --> 00:17.574
However, according to both the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization and the World Food Programme,...

00:17.741 --> 00:21.133
...there is currently enough food on the planet for everyone to be well-fed.

00:21.859 --> 00:25.677
Not only that, but we're growing this food on less land than we did in the past.

00:26.071 --> 00:30.478
Agricultural experts even believed that Africa, if cultivated using modern farming methods,...

00:30.701 --> 00:33.223
...could eventually feed the whole world all by itself.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.958
Then why are people in many parts of the world starving?

00:36.200 --> 00:39.080
The World Food Programme lists key causes of hunger.

00:39.529 --> 00:41.644
And overpopulation is not on that list.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.771
War, one of the leading causes of world hunger,...

00:44.944 --> 00:47.078
...destroys crops and disrupts relief efforts.

00:47.591 --> 00:51.139
Widespread poverty prevents many from buying the food that they need.

00:51.735 --> 00:57.008
And the lack of infrastructure means that there isn't a reliable way to transport food to areas that need it.

00:58.339 --> 01:02.940
This is why reducing the number of hungry people will not make the remaining people less hungry.

01:03.287 --> 01:05.977
Those who have access to the food will continue to have access to it,...

01:06.205 --> 01:08.075
...and those who don't will still be hungry.

01:08.451 --> 01:12.031
Reducing population will not magically cause food to be spread around equally.

01:12.709 --> 01:18.970
And blaming overpopulation for everything does nothing but distract us from the real problems that we actually have.

01:20.322 --> 01:21.017
Think about it.
