ï»¿I think when 8th grade girls hear the term engineering,...

00:07.191 --> 00:13.185
...it's a very broad term that they may not fully understand and so being able to come here...

00:13.241 --> 00:16.960
...and meet engineers and be able to have the hands-on experience...

00:17.029 --> 00:22.738
...where they can see and learn everything that encompasses engineering is very beneficial.

00:23.443 --> 00:27.145
To inspire these young minds, we're giving them an opportunity...

00:27.209 --> 00:29.463
...to really understand what's possible.

00:29.958 --> 00:31.749
They're gonna learn to do in this activity,...

00:31.825 --> 00:34.485
...it's a very hands-on activity that they're doing today.

00:34.927 --> 00:37.046
They're gonna make mistakes and that's okay.

00:37.549 --> 00:41.602
Because in engineering, sometimes we don't get it right the first time.

00:41.905 --> 00:45.820
We would love to have it right the first time all the time, but sometimes we don't.

00:46.564 --> 00:48.464
But you learn from it and that's what's important...

00:48.695 --> 00:52.631
...is that you go through the process of thinking about, "What's the problem I'm gonna solve?"

00:52.999 --> 00:53.991
"How do you solve it?"

00:54.379 --> 00:57.569
You work in a team environment that allows you to...

00:57.650 --> 01:00.423
...talk and work with other people who will help solve your problems.

01:00.803 --> 01:02.132
You don't have to do it by yourself.

01:02.569 --> 01:05.548
They're thinking of new problems, they want new capabilities.

01:06.145 --> 01:07.638
They're our future engineers.

01:07.773 --> 01:11.651
I saw a lot of excitement from the girls when they were putting the hands together,...

01:11.725 --> 01:14.364
...and seeing their hands on, seeing them putting the little pieces together.

01:14.761 --> 01:17.917
And mostly when they saw the finished product and actually could see...

01:18.255 --> 01:21.765
...how the hand works and how it can benefit a person.

01:22.254 --> 01:24.747
I just want to thank Rockwell Collins for allowing us to come...

01:24.846 --> 01:28.533
...and allowing us to be a part of such a cool event that the kids can experience.

01:28.611 --> 01:32.083
And again, just have that hands-on experience and meet the engineers,...

01:32.167 --> 01:36.107
...to get excited and be inspired to possibly become an engineer.
