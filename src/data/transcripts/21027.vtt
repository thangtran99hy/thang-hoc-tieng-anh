00:20.594 --> 00:22.346
I still have a dream.

00:24.377 --> 00:27.587
It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

00:33.449 --> 00:34.557
I have a dream...

00:37.909 --> 00:44.660
...that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged...

00:44.783 --> 00:48.310
...by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

00:48.579 --> 00:50.069
I have a dream today.

00:59.617 --> 01:02.829
I have a dream that I will go to school.

01:03.467 --> 01:07.830
I have a dream that I will provide the best life possible for my family.

01:08.143 --> 01:13.169
I have a dream that people will open their hearts and minds to those who are different from them.

01:13.559 --> 01:17.191
I have a dream that all people will be able to express their opinions...

01:17.391 --> 01:18.754
...and share ideas freely.

01:19.310 --> 01:24.185
I have a dream that we'll learn to appreciate and protect our environment,...

01:24.651 --> 01:29.272
...enjoying what it offers us, while preserving it for future generations.

01:29.579 --> 01:33.863
We have a dream that we will one day live in a peaceful and harmonious world,...

01:34.224 --> 01:39.205
...where everyone will be given the opportunity to be happy, safe and healthy.

01:40.055 --> 01:44.821
I have a dream that Dr. King's dream of equality will no longer be a dream...

01:45.383 --> 01:48.621
...and that it will come true for everyone, everywhere.

01:56.183 --> 02:02.694
When we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet,...

02:03.059 --> 02:05.483
...from every state and every city,...

02:06.907 --> 02:13.361
...we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men,...

02:13.727 --> 02:16.633
...Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics,...

02:17.033 --> 02:22.049
...will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:...

02:22.347 --> 02:23.250
..."Free at last!"

02:23.765 --> 02:24.673
"Free at last!"

02:25.091 --> 02:27.709
"Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!"
