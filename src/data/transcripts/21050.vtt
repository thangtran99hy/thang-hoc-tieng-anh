00:00.231 --> 00:04.005
ï»¿Dr. King and A. Philip Randolph, John Lewis and Bayard Rustin,...

00:05.398 --> 00:08.522
...Dorothy Height, Myrlie Evers, Daisy Bates...

00:09.139 --> 00:11.817
...and all the others who led this massive march...

00:12.679 --> 00:15.084
...knew what they were doing on this hallowed ground.

00:17.386 --> 00:19.760
In the shadow of Lincoln's statue,...

00:21.975 --> 00:28.421
...the burning memory of the fact that he gave his life to preserve the union and end slavery,...

00:30.193 --> 00:36.592
...Martin Luther King urged his crowd not to drink from the cup of bitterness...

00:38.645 --> 00:40.995
...but to reach across the racial divide...

00:42.649 --> 00:46.177
...because, he said, we cannot walk alone.

00:47.301 --> 00:49.769
Their destiny is tied up with our destiny.

00:50.470 --> 00:54.907
Their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.

00:56.486 --> 01:03.451
He urged the victims of racial violence to meet white Americans with an outstretched hand,...

01:04.039 --> 01:05.321
...not a clenched hand,...

01:06.052 --> 01:12.153
...and, in so doing, to prove the redeeming power of unearned suffering.

01:13.761 --> 01:16.983
And then he dreamed...

01:18.365 --> 01:22.215
...of an America where all citizens would sit together at the table of brotherhood,...

01:23.289 --> 01:27.608
...where little white boys and girls and little black boys and girls would hold hands...

01:27.828 --> 01:28.979
...across the color line.

01:30.357 --> 01:34.381
Where his own children would be judged not by the color of their skin...

01:34.493 --> 01:36.269
...but by the content of their character.

01:37.943 --> 01:42.810
This march and that speech changed America.

01:43.945 --> 01:50.833
They opened minds, they melted hearts and they moved millions,...

01:51.832 --> 01:57.754
...including a 17-year-old boy watching alone in his home in Arkansas.
