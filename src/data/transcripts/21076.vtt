00:00.773 --> 00:02.932
ï»¿Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our call this afternoon.

00:03.826 --> 00:10.064
Google had a great quarter, over 14 billion in revenue, up 19 percent year-on-year;...

00:11.097 --> 00:15.748
...amazing performance for a company that has yet to celebrate its 15th birthday.

00:17.589 --> 00:19.333
We live in a world of abundant computing,...

00:20.113 --> 00:23.891
...with multiple operating systems and increasing numbers of devices.

00:24.815 --> 00:28.153
It is a very different environment from when Google started.

00:29.233 --> 00:33.639
There was essentially one OS and one device category, the PC.

00:35.207 --> 00:40.429
These kinds of changes don't happen that often; once a decade, maybe even less frequently.

00:41.846 --> 00:46.153
But the shift from laptop to mobiles, from one screen to multiple screens...

00:46.936 --> 00:48.975
...creates a tremendous opportunity for Google.

00:50.470 --> 00:55.381
With more devices, more information, and more activity online than ever,...

00:56.147 --> 00:58.822
...the potential to improve people's lives is immense:...

01:00.180 --> 01:02.938
...getting you the right information just when you need it;...

01:03.729 --> 01:08.586
...creating the tools to make everyone more effective at home and in work;...

01:09.532 --> 01:13.381
...and helping you share and remember the moments that matter in life.

01:14.359 --> 01:20.660
It's why I am so excited about the velocity and execution on our platforms, apps, and devices.

01:21.861 --> 01:28.105
First, platforms: with hindsight, Android and Chrome were no-brainers.

01:29.250 --> 01:31.587
At the time, they were big bets.

01:32.932 --> 01:35.303
The momentum across these platforms is tremendous,...

01:36.161 --> 01:38.813
...as you saw at our annual I/O developer conference in May.

01:39.903 --> 01:43.747
I was astounded we had over one million people tuning in live...

01:44.505 --> 01:46.224
...just to watch our developer keynote.

01:48.041 --> 01:52.667
We've now activated more than 900 million Android devices worldwide,...

01:53.790 --> 01:58.887
...and we're lighting up over 1.5 million devices every day.

02:00.823 --> 02:05.711
That's pretty amazing given that the first Android phone launched less than five years ago.

02:07.393 --> 02:09.111
And apps usage is increasing fast.

02:10.119 --> 02:14.857
Over 50 billion apps have been now downloaded from the Google Play store.

02:16.035 --> 02:19.027
In fact, we've already paid out more money to Android developers this year...

02:19.893 --> 02:22.193
...than in the whole of 2012.

02:23.957 --> 02:27.909
I love the ability to access your stuff on Play anywhere.

02:29.563 --> 02:31.332
Take our new music subscription service.

02:31.969 --> 02:35.673
Launched in May, it is an easy, fun way to discover new music...

02:36.413 --> 02:38.807
...with all the songs there ready to go.

02:40.109 --> 02:42.099
You never have to think about the device you are using.
