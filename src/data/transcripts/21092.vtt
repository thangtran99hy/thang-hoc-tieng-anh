00:00.215 --> 00:04.293
ï»¿I remember being very fearful of the unknown of what might happen next.

00:05.279 --> 00:07.763
I remember it being like a bad dream.

00:08.042 --> 00:10.432
I remember the plane flying over my head.

00:10.773 --> 00:13.979
I remember kind of hiding my eyes and not looking at the television.

00:14.152 --> 00:18.461
I remember the faces of my colleagues as the building sways so violently...

00:18.527 --> 00:19.466
....after the plane crashed.

00:19.555 --> 00:22.630
I remember fliers of all the missing people.

00:22.735 --> 00:24.991
That is an image that seared in my mind.

00:25.223 --> 00:27.317
I remember seeing people helping one another.

00:27.469 --> 00:29.065
I think it's pulled the community together.

00:29.166 --> 00:31.408
I remember people talking to each other.

00:31.492 --> 00:33.475
...an unbelievable sense of community.

00:33.689 --> 00:35.944
I remember all of us coming together.

00:36.215 --> 00:37.731
It wasn't just a New York thing.

00:37.811 --> 00:39.500
We all were affected in some way.

00:39.573 --> 00:40.887
You just wanna do something.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.643
I will remember by planting a tree.

00:42.734 --> 00:45.426
I will continue to serve as a volunteer firefighter.

00:45.521 --> 00:48.291
I will remember by taking my daughter to the Bronx Zoo.

00:48.493 --> 00:49.582
I will call my grandmother.

00:49.663 --> 00:50.649
I will clean up my room.

00:50.903 --> 00:51.366
I will...

00:51.509 --> 00:51.927
I will...

00:51.997 --> 00:52.459
I will...

00:52.558 --> 00:54.545
I will make a difference.
