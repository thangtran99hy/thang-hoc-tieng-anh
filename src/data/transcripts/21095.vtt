00:01.646 --> 00:04.599
Situated on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe,...

00:04.800 --> 00:10.323
...the Victoria Falls rise 420 feet high and extend one mile wide.

00:10.646 --> 00:16.258
Named in 1855 by Scottish explorer David Livingston after Queen Victoria,...

00:16.457 --> 00:21.252
...the name locally of the falls translates into "the smoke that thunders."

00:21.625 --> 00:23.373
Particularly unique and beautiful...

00:23.452 --> 00:26.281
...because of the narrow chasm that the water falls into,...

00:26.572 --> 00:29.741
...Victoria Falls is the largest single sheet of water in the world...

00:29.873 --> 00:32.089
...with Niagara Falls pale in comparison.

00:32.445 --> 00:35.425
Located about midway down the Zambezi River,...

00:35.635 --> 00:38.538
...the chasm is about 400 feet wide...

00:38.643 --> 00:41.315
...and was carved along a fracture in the Earth's crust.

00:41.652 --> 00:46.308
Every minute, about 500 million liters of water go over the falls' edges.

00:46.518 --> 00:49.109
And the fast force of all this falling water...

00:49.301 --> 00:52.722
...creates spray that rises hundreds of feet into the air.
