ï»¿What do Harry Potter, Katniss Everdeen and Frodo....

00:17.620 --> 00:20.517
...all have in common with the heroes of ancient myths?

00:21.406 --> 00:24.522
What if I told you they are all variants of the same hero?

00:25.715 --> 00:26.413
Do you believe that?

00:27.503 --> 00:28.452
Joseph Campbell did.

00:29.085 --> 00:31.067
He studied myths from all over the world...

00:31.170 --> 00:34.335
...and published a book called, "The Hero with a Thousand Faces",...

00:34.691 --> 00:35.975
...retelling dozens of stories...

00:36.279 --> 00:40.381
...and explaining how each represents the "monomyth" or "hero's journey".

00:42.051 --> 00:43.775
So, what is the hero's journey?

00:44.687 --> 00:45.918
Think of it as a cycle.

00:46.716 --> 00:50.009
The journey begins and ends in a hero's ordinary world,...

00:50.677 --> 00:54.474
...but the quest passes through an unfamiliar, special world.

00:55.105 --> 00:56.651
Along the way, there are some key events.

00:57.577 --> 00:59.405
Think about your favorite book or movie.

01:00.134 --> 01:01.302
Does it follow this pattern?

01:03.412 --> 01:05.173
Status quo, that's where we start.

01:07.172 --> 01:09.241
One o'clock: Call to Adventure.

01:09.635 --> 01:11.850
The hero receives a mysterious message.

01:12.038 --> 01:12.695
An invitation?

01:13.159 --> 01:13.789
A challenge?

01:14.491 --> 01:16.027
Two o'clock: Assistance.

01:16.543 --> 01:20.509
The hero needs some help, probably from someone older, wiser.

01:21.055 --> 01:22.399
Three o'clock: Departure.

01:22.673 --> 01:25.946
The hero crosses the threshold from his normal, safe home,...

01:26.175 --> 01:28.510
...and enters the special world and adventure.

01:28.945 --> 01:30.167
We're not in Kansas anymore.

01:30.951 --> 01:32.293
Four o'clock: Trials.

01:32.662 --> 01:33.805
Being a hero is hard work.

01:34.099 --> 01:37.583
Our hero solves a riddle, slays a monster, escapes from a trap.

01:39.140 --> 01:40.951
Five o'clock: Approach.

01:41.585 --> 01:45.029
It's time to face the biggest ordeal, the hero's worst fear.

01:48.205 --> 01:49.880
Six o'clock: Crisis.

01:50.671 --> 01:52.225
This is the hero's darkest hour.

01:52.841 --> 01:57.335
He faces death and possibly even dies, only to be reborn.

01:58.745 --> 02:00.372
Seven o'clock: Treasure.

02:02.375 --> 02:07.077
As a result, the hero claims some treasure, special recognition or power.

02:08.161 --> 02:09.431
Eight o'clock: Result.

02:09.919 --> 02:11.454
This can vary between stories.

02:12.147 --> 02:14.125
Do the monsters bow down before the hero,...

02:14.541 --> 02:17.371
...or do they chase him as he flees from the special world?

02:18.358 --> 02:19.834
Nine o'clock: Return.

02:20.522 --> 02:23.801
After all that adventure, the hero returns to his ordinary world.

02:25.009 --> 02:26.756
Ten o'clock: New Life.

02:27.238 --> 02:28.718
This quest has changed the hero.

02:29.666 --> 02:30.906
He has outgrown his old life.

02:32.170 --> 02:34.069
Eleven o'clock: Resolution.

02:34.685 --> 02:36.643
All the tangled plotlines get straightened out.

02:38.092 --> 02:42.058
Twelve o'clock: Status Quo, but upgraded to a new level.

02:42.851 --> 02:44.728
Nothing is quite the same once you are a hero.
