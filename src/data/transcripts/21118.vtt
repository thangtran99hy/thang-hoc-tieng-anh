It's September 19th, and as many of you ought to know, today is Talk like a Pirate Day.

00:05.143 --> 00:08.348
For most of us land lovers, it's been a year or more since we spoke properly,...

00:08.672 --> 00:12.261
...so here are a few simple suggestions that can help make you the toast of the crew.

00:13.742 --> 00:15.036
Start with simple word replacement,...

00:15.228 --> 00:17.084
...changing the following words in your vocabulary:...

00:17.371 --> 00:18.974
..."My" to "me", "you" to "ye",...

00:19.144 --> 00:22.423
..."I am", "you are", "he is", "she is" to "I be", "you be", "he be", "she be",...

00:22.701 --> 00:26.389
..."yes" and "yeah" to "aye", "hello" and "hey" to "ahoy", "of" to "o'"...

00:26.629 --> 00:28.855
...and "buddy" or "friend" to "matey" or "me hartey".

00:29.778 --> 00:31.559
Throw in a gravelly, chain-smoker voice,...

00:31.621 --> 00:33.777
...and it will change mundane everyday things like,...

00:34.017 --> 00:38.775
..."Hey buddy, how are you?" into the pirate worthy, "Ahoy matey, how be ye?"

00:39.221 --> 00:42.793
Now, squinting and contorting your face doesn't really help you speak pirate any better,...

00:43.193 --> 00:44.662
...but it may help you feel the part...

00:44.775 --> 00:47.013
...and make the whole experience more believable for others.

00:47.579 --> 00:50.119
Another important aspect to talking like a pirate is "argh".

00:50.531 --> 00:54.151
Surprise, delight, anger, lust, "argh" can pretty much fit any emotion,...

00:54.645 --> 00:57.828
...but you might want to practice in front of the mirror to get your pirate face just right.

00:59.635 --> 01:00.966
You see, the meaning of "argh" is determined...

01:01.033 --> 01:03.711
...almost entirely by context and facial expression.

01:05.825 --> 01:09.111
Also, try using the word "treasure" when discussing anything of value.

01:09.519 --> 01:11.143
Old school pirates called it "booty",...

01:11.428 --> 01:14.947
...but ordering someone to give up their "booty" can be a little questionable in mixed company.

01:15.379 --> 01:17.084
If you need safer words for "treasure",...

01:17.184 --> 01:21.105
...try "swag", "coin", "plunder", "pieces of eight", "doubloons" or "cargo".

01:22.024 --> 01:25.515
Down in the hold, we've left ye a treasure trove of piratey things to say.

01:26.099 --> 01:26.795
Here's a taste of them.

01:27.409 --> 01:29.116
Heave to and prepare to be boarded.

01:29.259 --> 01:30.863
Rattle me bones, avast ye swabs.

01:30.959 --> 01:32.891
Look lively, ship shape, big as a whale.

01:33.003 --> 01:35.062
Not worth but two bits, weather the Lizard.

01:35.419 --> 01:39.177
That's it, flibber your gibbets and have a happy Talk like a Pirate Day.
