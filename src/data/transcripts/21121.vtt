Mysteries of Vernacular.

00:08.920 --> 00:12.669
Bewilder: To confuse or puzzle completely.

00:13.671 --> 00:18.191
The root of the word "bewilder" can be traced back to the Old English word "wilde,"...

00:18.763 --> 00:25.965
...which was used to refer to something that was in a natural state, uncultivated or undomesticated.

00:26.667 --> 00:31.399
Over time, the word "wilde" was often linked to the Old English word "deor."

00:32.323 --> 00:37.980
"Deor," which was derived from an early Indo-European root that meant "breathe,"...

00:38.455 --> 00:42.370
...was initially used to describe any untamed animal or beast.

00:43.743 --> 00:50.687
This eventually morphed into the modern word "deer," meaning a ruminant of the family Cervidae.

00:51.754 --> 00:56.937
The two Old English words when mashed together became "wilderness,"...

00:57.319 --> 01:03.718
...meaning a tract of uncultivated land primarily inhabited by undomesticated beasts.

01:04.277 --> 01:08.285
From the word "wilderness," the word "wilder" was born.

01:08.799 --> 01:14.050
To "wilder" someone was to lead him astray or lure him into the woods.

01:14.739 --> 01:21.711
In the 1600s, the prefix "be," meaning "thoroughly," was compounded with "wilder"...

01:22.075 --> 01:25.153
...as a way of tacking on a little extra punch.

01:26.089 --> 01:30.280
Someone who was "bewildered" was thoroughly lost in the wild.

01:30.989 --> 01:36.939
From this winding background, "bewilder" eventually evolved into our current definition:...

01:37.247 --> 01:39.225
...to be completely confused.
