The iPhone 5c is in many ways the distillation of what people love about the iPhone 5.

00:07.427 --> 00:13.313
It's simpler, more essential, yet it's more capable, and certainly more colorful.

00:14.938 --> 00:17.228
We believe the iPhone is an experience.

00:17.626 --> 00:22.732
An experience is defined by hardware and software working harmoniously together.

00:23.836 --> 00:26.444
We continue to refine that experience,...

00:26.653 --> 00:31.383
...dramatically blurring the boundaries between the two, making it more powerful,...

00:31.583 --> 00:34.359
...more intuitive, and ultimately more useful.

00:38.781 --> 00:43.169
iPhone 5c is beautifully, unapologetically plastic.

00:45.025 --> 00:50.501
Multiple parts have been reduced to a single polycarbonate component...

00:50.811 --> 00:54.341
...whose service is continuous and seamless.

00:55.338 --> 00:58.681
I think the designs with the real coherence...

00:59.276 --> 01:04.591
...are the result of developing form, material, and color in unison.

01:05.413 --> 01:09.236
Each element informing and in many ways defining the other,...

01:09.593 --> 01:12.675
...creating a significant and a meaningful design.

01:13.650 --> 01:18.201
Just as with its appearance we took the same fanatical care...

01:18.714 --> 01:21.572
...with how the iPhone 5c feels in your hand.

01:22.158 --> 01:26.783
That sense of quality and integrity that's synonymous with the iPhone.

01:27.334 --> 01:32.504
That meant developing the design by creating a whole new structure architecture.

01:35.637 --> 01:38.301
It starts with a single piece of polycarbonate.

01:41.261 --> 01:47.363
Into which we install a steel reinforced frame creating a bespoke assembly...

01:47.780 --> 01:49.252
...that doubles as an antenna.

01:50.196 --> 01:51.629
We then add the rear plate.

01:52.243 --> 01:54.397
We then machine holes for the buttons,...

01:54.827 --> 01:56.835
...ensuring perfect alignment.

01:57.193 --> 02:01.469
And then, the entire assembly goes through multiple finishing processes...

02:02.277 --> 02:08.161
...including a clear lacquer hard coat that creates a durable and incredibly glassy surface.

02:09.065 --> 02:13.355
This whole process culminates in an extraordinarily rigid structure...

02:13.679 --> 02:19.045
...and a solid dense feel that you would not expect from a plastic product.

02:19.893 --> 02:24.019
From the beginning, we wanted to design cases as colorful...

02:24.351 --> 02:26.857
...and as well-made as the iPhone itself.

02:27.773 --> 02:34.703
The soft mat, micro fiber line silicon is a very intentional contrast...

02:35.137 --> 02:38.318
...to the glossy hard coat finish of the iPhone.

02:40.153 --> 02:45.099
The result is a case that extends and complements the product...

02:45.559 --> 02:48.726
...while offering dozens of colorful combination.

02:51.649 --> 02:56.964
I think it's quite remarkable when something feels familiar...

02:57.478 --> 02:59.177
...and yet it's new at the same time.

03:00.531 --> 03:01.983
That's the iPhone 5c.

03:03.637 --> 03:11.365
It's the vivid realisation of hardware and software together in one device.
