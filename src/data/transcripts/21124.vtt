iPhone 5c is built on a foundation of features that people know and love.

00:06.169 --> 00:08.066
With a beautiful four-inch retina display,...

00:08.572 --> 00:12.135
...blazing-fast performance and console level graphics from the a6 chip,...

00:12.782 --> 00:16.693
...the eight-megapixel iSight camera and an impressive battery life.

00:17.613 --> 00:22.273
And now we've added more LTE bands than any other smartphone in the world.

00:23.001 --> 00:28.950
And we've given it a new FaceTime HD camera for even better FaceTime calls and self-portraits.

00:30.413 --> 00:32.666
Beyond that, it comes with iOS 7...

00:33.313 --> 00:37.987
...which includes new features like Control Center, AirDrop and iTunes Radio.

00:38.308 --> 00:40.565
Combined with a ton of other great features,...

00:40.821 --> 00:46.691
...IOS 7 creates an experience that's even simpler, more useful and more enjoyable.

00:47.093 --> 00:51.291
iOS 7 is designed to complement the iPhone 5c beautifully.

00:52.002 --> 00:54.487
The wallpapers are color-matched to the exterior...

00:54.930 --> 01:00.031
...and the translucency inherent in iOS 7 carries this color through everything you do.

01:01.096 --> 01:06.775
This is just another great example of how we design and engineer our products in concert.

01:07.787 --> 01:12.448
It really is the only way that we believe provides the right experience.
