A startup of the year, in order to be a great startup, to be a great entrepreneur,...

00:13.829 --> 00:16.379
...you've got to be in this 25/7.

00:17.385 --> 00:20.685
That you're on this, this is your full-time passion and your love.

00:21.028 --> 00:24.459
This isn't, "Well, I'm working at Google and on the side I've got this little project."

00:24.543 --> 00:26.682
Or, "I'm at an ad agency but I'm dabbling in this."

00:27.013 --> 00:30.819
This is you know, you'd sell your mother for a shot at this.

00:32.079 --> 00:34.418
Not, I don't mean this, it's "Startup of the Year."

00:34.553 --> 00:35.754
I would think that would be the other thing,...

00:35.841 --> 00:39.394
...that "Startup of the Year" wouldn't be considered a win to this person.

00:39.602 --> 00:42.674
That's like nice, but the win to this person is this company.

00:42.744 --> 00:45.989
And that there's just no other distraction from this company...

00:46.075 --> 00:48.143
...kind of has to make and then not do anything.
