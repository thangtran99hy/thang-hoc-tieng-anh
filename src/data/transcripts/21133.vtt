...each leg having a separate tubular piece.

00:26.607 --> 00:28.997
We also know them as trousers.

00:30.253 --> 00:36.935
The history of the word "pants" begins in the 4th century with the Roman Catholic saint, Pantaleon.

00:38.069 --> 00:44.935
Because Pantaleon was the patron saint of Venice, Venetians were commonly called "Pantaleonis."

In 16th century Italy, a type of comedy theater called commedia dell'arte was born.

The masked characters of the theater were based on stock types...

00:58.463 --> 01:06.955
...like the comic servant Harlequin, the clown Scaramouch and the miserly Venetian merchant Pantalone.

01:08.060 --> 01:13.398
The Venetian trader's costume was distinguished by the particular cut of his trousers...

01:14.073 --> 01:17.024
...which the French began to call "pantaloons."

01:17.802 --> 01:23.917
By the late 1700s, the word "pantaloons" had come to describe any style of trousers.

01:25.503 --> 01:30.705
As the word migrated to Britain, the lower classes shortened "pantaloons" to "pants."

01:31.933 --> 01:35.659
Though the upper class initially considered the abbreviation vulgar,...

01:36.367 --> 01:40.304
...by the time Edgar Allan Poe printed the word in 1840,...

01:41.111 --> 01:45.353
..."pants" was a generally accepted term with the meaning we know today.
