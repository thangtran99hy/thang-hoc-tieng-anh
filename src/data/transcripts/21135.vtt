In 2011, the northeast of Japan was struck by an earthquake and the tsunami.

00:09.408 --> 00:14.355
The IOC along with the whole sports family held out a hand of support.

00:17.334 --> 00:19.855
Japan will never forget this generosity.

00:20.717 --> 00:25.737
And as a mark of its gratitude, it would like to be a stepping stone to the future.

00:28.407 --> 00:34.673
And now to ensure that I am understood, please allow me to continue in English.

00:37.754 --> 00:43.893
I imagine that the members of the Evaluation Commission are surprised to see me here.

00:45.495 --> 00:49.472
Well, I can assure them that I am just as surprised as they are.

00:51.450 --> 00:55.973
What I said in Tokyo regarding the role and position of our family still holds true.

00:57.083 --> 01:03.232
However, I am more than pleased that it has befallen me to personally convey...

01:03.567 --> 01:09.222
...our heartfelt thanks to each and every member of the IOC.

01:11.817 --> 01:13.789
The IOC special aid program,...

01:14.271 --> 01:18.946
...the Tsubasa project has brought smiles to the faces of many children...

01:19.301 --> 01:21.206
...and given hope to young athletes.

01:22.294 --> 01:25.508
Tsubasa means 'wing' in Japanese.

01:27.542 --> 01:34.903
And we hope that these young people will take wing and fly into the future of their dreams.

01:36.961 --> 01:40.449
You have in the spirit of the Olympic movement,...

01:42.015 --> 01:44.643
...given them something about which to dream.

01:45.556 --> 01:47.215
Given them motivation.

01:48.775 --> 01:54.115
You have shown them that they should move forward with courage and conviction.

01:56.087 --> 02:01.715
I have heard that an important aspect of the Olympics is the leaving of legacies.

02:02.775 --> 02:07.755
Well, your legacy will certainly live on in the hearts of these young people.

02:10.847 --> 02:15.254
This maybe the first time a member of our family has addressed you,...

02:16.063 --> 02:22.491
...but the imperial family of Japan has always been very active in supporting sport.
