It's Thursday night and the Jaffa Flea Market is rocking.

00:08.741 --> 00:12.140
Street vendors have set up tables laden with homemade crafts,...

00:12.288 --> 00:15.149
...locally made clothes and unique accessories.

00:15.726 --> 00:22.687
The Shuk is an attraction night or day for Israelis and tourists alike and especially in summer.

00:23.306 --> 00:26.755
We read in the book that it's a good place to visit.

00:27.032 --> 00:32.338
The most strong compliment that we can receive is when people buy our stuff...

00:32.501 --> 00:38.818
...and when somebody is passing and just smiling by looking at one of the sculptures,...

00:39.115 --> 00:39.849
...that makes my day.

00:40.199 --> 00:45.503
This is one of the oldest markets in the world and whereas it used to be a place to find knickknacks...

00:45.593 --> 00:51.169
...and secondhand furniture or clothing, today, it is also one of the trendiest spots in Israel.

00:52.065 --> 00:55.505
Fashion designers, artists and gourmet chefs have all moved in...

00:55.884 --> 01:00.057
...making it a destination for both bargain hunters and the stylish alike.
