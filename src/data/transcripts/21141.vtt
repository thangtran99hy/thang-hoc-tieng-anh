Dear friends, that feeling that only sports can give touches the whole world.

00:12.396 --> 00:19.702
Mr. President, the Olympic movement has enjoyed a golden era of more than 20 years...

00:20.709 --> 00:24.713
...because of clear and strong leadership,...

00:25.743 --> 00:33.621
...because of the strategic decisions of its members and because of its timeless values.

00:35.131 --> 00:42.355
New generations of young people have benefited and I'm delighted that one of them is here.

00:43.108 --> 00:48.403
The first ever Youth Olympic Games gold medalist, triathlete Yuka Sato.

00:54.457 --> 01:01.079
We are proud that our athletes have competed since Stockholm in 1912.

01:01.799 --> 01:07.759
And prouder still that they have competed in the true spirit of Olympism,...

01:09.064 --> 01:17.966
...with not a single Japanese athlete ever failing a doping test at the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

01:18.917 --> 01:22.491
Not just because of legislation,...

01:23.598 --> 01:33.115
...but because of a long-standing and unified approach by government, the NOC and national federations,...

01:34.500 --> 01:41.969
...who all agree that we must support athletes and uphold the integrity of the Olympic values.

01:43.693 --> 01:50.811
That commitment to the Olympic values is at the heart of this, our second consecutive bid,...

01:52.181 --> 01:57.863
...a bid in which we have focused on what matters to you today.

01:59.163 --> 02:06.543
First, which city will best continue the financial and sporting success of the movement?

02:07.575 --> 02:12.757
Second, which city offers guaranteed delivery of superb games?

02:14.234 --> 02:20.380
And finally, which city goes beyond a national agenda and has a global vision...

02:20.999 --> 02:25.087
...to promote the Olympic values in this challenging era for sports?

02:27.982 --> 02:36.555
These days, sport itself is in competition, and too often, its credibility is at stake...

02:37.869 --> 02:43.102
...because of doping, illegal betting and match fixing.

02:45.182 --> 02:51.342
In Japan, in the last two years, we have seen the best of sport.

02:52.261 --> 03:00.839
It has inspired our global vision and fed our determination to share the inspiration,...

03:01.946 --> 03:07.623
...so that the entire Olympic family benefits from our three core strengths.

03:08.569 --> 03:16.559
Delivery, because Tokyo can be trusted to be the safe pair of hands and much more.

03:18.278 --> 03:26.264
Celebration, because Tokyo will host an incredible city center party like never before.

03:27.995 --> 03:37.111
And innovation, because Tokyo will offer all its creativity and technology to benefit sport worldwide.
