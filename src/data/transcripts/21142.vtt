Dear friends, those three strengths add up to one word: opportunity.

00:09.519 --> 00:15.601
Tokyo 2020 offers a gateway to the vast, young continent of Asia.

00:16.805 --> 00:22.633
Home to more than four billion people, including more than one billion young people.

00:23.499 --> 00:28.470
In fact, more young people live inside of this circle than outside.

00:29.673 --> 00:36.786
Tokyo will offer seven years for your sport to grow in this important market.

00:38.231 --> 00:44.080
The games will deliver the biggest live primetime TV audience in history,...

00:45.455 --> 00:51.980
...the biggest local ticketing market, and the greatest possible commercial success.

00:53.477 --> 00:57.589
Already, our bid has 21 corporate sponsors,...

00:58.435 --> 01:03.454
...and the JOC is experiencing record sponsorship levels.

01:04.845 --> 01:07.319
Corporate Japan will support the games,...

01:08.129 --> 01:16.639
...and ensure the IOC can focus on your own crucial programs to promote Olympism worldwide.

01:18.411 --> 01:26.323
Our pioneering plan also offers a model of how to host the games in the center of a major city.

01:27.813 --> 01:32.533
The starting point was our strong proposal from the 2016 bid,...

01:33.836 --> 01:40.535
...which we improved, thanks to input from the IOC, athletes, IFs and NOCs.

01:42.154 --> 01:44.539
I will give three examples.

01:45.467 --> 01:51.903
First, the village, which is now in a much better place and bigger...

01:53.233 --> 01:56.182
...and with a bed for every athlete.

01:57.411 --> 02:03.847
Second, the new Olympic stadium, which will be a major new landmark,...

02:05.269 --> 02:10.503
...and where every athlete can have a seat to enjoy the Opening Ceremony.

02:11.531 --> 02:15.486
And third, an even more compact venue plan.

02:17.289 --> 02:19.900
I will conclude in French.

02:27.226 --> 02:33.012
I have already said this several times in the past but I've never said it in French.

02:34.799 --> 02:38.615
We have kept the best and improved the rest.

02:43.401 --> 02:53.017
Lastly, let me say what emotion and gratitude I feel...

02:54.536 --> 03:00.286
...for the friendships we've been able to forge over the last 20 years.

03:01.160 --> 03:10.495
Today, on behalf of these friendships, I call upon your trust.

03:11.061 --> 03:13.361
And also in the name of these friendships.
