00:00.489 --> 00:04.099
Imagine living in the heart of that city.

00:05.215 --> 00:08.805
Waking up to stunning waterfront views,...

00:09.621 --> 00:13.203
...competing in venues you can see from your bedroom.

00:14.119 --> 00:19.099
All just a short walk from some of the coolest parts of a city...

00:19.830 --> 00:22.855
...that is a world capital of youth culture.

00:24.032 --> 00:27.860
This is what athletes can look forward to in Tokyo.

00:29.093 --> 00:33.318
As an athlete, I am proud to say our views have been taken on board.

00:33.809 --> 00:42.803
So, for example, the village will be the center of our games both in spirit and geography.

00:44.458 --> 00:48.837
Athletes from every country will also enjoy passionate support...

00:49.562 --> 00:53.363
...from Japanese fans who really know sport, and appreciate fair play.

00:54.431 --> 01:02.151
Last summer, more than five hundred thousand took to the streets of Tokyo on a weekday...

01:02.697 --> 01:05.685
...to celebrate with us London 2012 athletes.

01:06.409 --> 01:13.000
Just look at the pictures and imagine that passion in 2020.

01:14.345 --> 01:15.961
Every venue will be filled.

01:16.473 --> 01:18.237
Every sport will sparkle.

01:18.910 --> 01:25.187
Tokyo will deliver an incredible platform for the promotion of the Olympic movement.

01:26.266 --> 01:32.490
Promotion that will go hand in hand with worldwide appeal of Japan's youth culture...

01:33.420 --> 01:42.139
...whose animated heroes inspired real life stars such as Messi, Kaka and Uchimura,...

01:42.654 --> 01:48.366
...as well as many children, in many countries, to take up their favorite sport.

01:50.219 --> 01:53.533
And promotion also based on innovation.

01:54.426 --> 02:00.420
Imagine technology such as next generation motion tracking...

02:01.461 --> 02:06.578
...in sports presentation, in live sites and more.

02:08.084 --> 02:16.967
All to connect more young people with sport so that they, like me,...
