Mr. President, distinguished members of the IOC.

00:05.564 --> 00:13.195
It would be a tremendous honor for us to host the games in 2020 in Tokyo,...

00:14.687 --> 00:22.893
...one of the safest cities in the world, now and in 2020.

00:23.758 --> 00:29.082
Some may have concerns about Fukushima.

00:30.063 --> 00:37.040
Let me assure you, the situation is under control.

00:38.592 --> 00:46.632
It has never done and will never do any damage to Tokyo.

00:49.481 --> 00:59.796
I can also say, from a new stadium that will look like no other to confirmed financing,...

01:00.454 --> 01:05.611
...Tokyo 2020 will offer guaranteed delivery.

01:07.405 --> 01:13.982
Now, I am here today with a message that is even more important.

01:15.297 --> 01:22.047
We in Japan are true believers in the Olympic movement.

01:23.417 --> 01:27.242
I, myself, am just one example.

01:28.377 --> 01:38.573
When I entered college in 1973, I began practicing archery.

01:39.528 --> 01:40.717
Can you guess why?

01:42.230 --> 01:50.539
The year before, in Munich, archery returned as an Olympic event after a long time.

01:51.289 --> 01:56.199
My love of the Olympics was already well-established.

01:57.591 --> 02:10.362
When I close my eyes, vivid scenes from the opening ceremony in Tokyo in 1964 come back to me.

02:11.643 --> 02:15.898
Several thousand doves, all set free at once.

02:16.393 --> 02:23.821
High up in the deep blue sky, five jet planes making the Olympic rings.

02:24.931 --> 02:30.492
All amazing to me, only ten years old.

02:31.777 --> 02:36.990
We in Japan learned that sports connect the world,...

02:37.489 --> 02:42.049
...and sports give an equal chance to everyone.

02:43.525 --> 02:51.994
The Olympic spirit also taught us that legacy is not just about buildings,...

02:52.807 --> 02:57.203
...not even about national projects.

02:57.948 --> 03:05.062
It is about global vision and investment in people.

03:05.885 --> 03:10.987
So, the very next year, Japan made a volunteer organization...

03:11.225 --> 03:18.194
...and began spreading the message of sports far and wide.

03:18.890 --> 03:23.500
Young Japanese, as many as three thousand,...

03:24.061 --> 03:30.780
...have worked as sports instructors in over 80 countries to date,...

03:31.431 --> 03:39.945
...and they have touched the hearts of well over a million people through their work.

03:41.381 --> 03:49.971
Distinguished members of the IOC, I say that choosing Tokyo 2020...

03:51.121 --> 03:57.615
...means choosing a new, powerful booster for the Olympic movement.

03:58.595 --> 04:01.889
Under our new plan, "Sport for Tomorrow,"...

04:02.451 --> 04:08.538
...young Japanese will go out into the world in even larger numbers.

04:09.096 --> 04:19.295
They will help build schools, bring in equipment, and create sports education programs.

04:20.315 --> 04:25.201
And by the time the Olympic torch reaches Tokyo in 2020,...

04:25.863 --> 04:38.877
...they will bring the joy of sports directly to ten million people in over 100 countries.

04:40.527 --> 04:49.276
Choose Tokyo today and you choose a nation that is a passionate, proud,...

04:49.957 --> 04:53.033
...and a strong believer in the Olympic movement,...

04:53.398 --> 04:58.259
...and which strongly desires to work together with the IOC...

04:58.795 --> 05:07.243
...in order to make the world a better place through the power of sport.

05:08.533 --> 05:10.765
We are ready to work with you.

05:11.405 --> 05:12.958
Thank you very much.
