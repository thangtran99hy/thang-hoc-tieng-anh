00:00.637 --> 00:10.077
I stand here after a lifetime of education and inspiration through sport.

00:11.739 --> 00:17.886
When I was a teenager, it was sport that opened my eyes to the world.

00:19.541 --> 00:27.620
When I became an Olympian, it was sport that taught me about competing at the very highest level...

00:28.204 --> 00:35.616
...in a unique spirit, making enduring friendships, including with many of you.

00:38.096 --> 00:48.073
And in the last two years, sports has shown me time and again how it can connect and inspire,...

00:49.617 --> 00:58.458
...from the visits of Mami Sato and others to the smiling volunteers of 2012 London...

00:58.669 --> 01:02.054
...and the massive crowd for the athletes' parade in Tokyo.

01:04.205 --> 01:14.800
I am lucky, so lucky, to have seen great athletes, inspiring performances...

01:15.341 --> 01:18.494
...and the Olympic values made real.

01:20.785 --> 01:29.227
My goal and that of my entire team is to do everything we can to promote sport,...

01:29.771 --> 01:37.735
...faithful to the Olympic values, to as many people as possible in this challenging era.

01:40.695 --> 01:50.996
In my travels in support of this bid, I have spoken with many of you about the issues we face.

01:52.707 --> 01:57.911
And I'm optimistic that our shared desire to move forward together...

01:59.253 --> 02:03.955
...will safeguard sports for new generations.

02:06.541 --> 02:15.707
Mr. President, dear friends, that journey starts here in Buenos Aires.

02:17.805 --> 02:24.247
These next few days will help set the course of the movement for many years to come.

02:26.141 --> 02:32.268
Which is why there is a huge responsibility to make crucial decisions...

02:33.271 --> 02:38.969
...for the right reason: the benefit of global sport.

02:42.035 --> 02:44.744
Our case today is simple.

02:46.853 --> 02:52.415
Vote for Tokyo and you vote for guaranteed delivery.

02:53.483 --> 03:00.865
Vote for Tokyo and you vote for the superb games experience in every possible sense.

03:02.092 --> 03:10.545
Vote for Tokyo and you vote for the global vision to benefit sport from today to 2020...

03:10.845 --> 03:12.865
...and the many decades afterwards.

03:14.531 --> 03:20.229
Tokyo is the right partner at the right time.

03:22.023 --> 03:25.101
A city that will deliver,...

03:26.597 --> 03:31.230
...a nation that shares and upholds Olympic values,...

03:32.453 --> 03:40.210
...and the people who will work tirelessly with you in support of those precious values.

03:42.539 --> 03:52.852
Today, on behalf of my team and all Japan, I am proud to submit our bid.

03:54.658 --> 04:06.487
And also to give you my personal guarantee that Tokyo 2020 will see major legacies delivered,...

04:07.662 --> 04:10.403
...massive opportunities realized...

04:13.367 --> 04:20.596
...and sport, the Olympic movement itself, as the biggest winner!

04:25.059 --> 04:29.066
Mr. President, this concludes our presentation.

04:30.363 --> 04:30.821
Thank you.
