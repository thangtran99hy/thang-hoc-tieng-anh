ï»¿Hello.

00:00.774 --> 00:07.124
My name is Brian and today we are going to talk about introductions and making friends.

00:07.474 --> 00:10.800
An introduction is when you introduce yourself to someone.

00:11.245 --> 00:15.247
Usually the other person will also introduce themselves as well.

00:17.838 --> 00:19.200
Hi, my name is Brian.

00:19.281 --> 00:20.223
Nice to meet you.

00:20.631 --> 00:21.685
What's your name?

00:21.959 --> 00:23.197
My name is Joey.

00:23.575 --> 00:26.606
When you make a new friend or when you see somebody you know,...

00:26.915 --> 00:28.831
...you may want to shake hands.

00:29.245 --> 00:31.610
You will then have a conversation with the person.

00:32.051 --> 00:34.199
I am going to show you how it is done.

00:39.434 --> 00:40.933
Do you go to school here?

00:41.307 --> 00:41.749
Yes.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.979
I am in Mrs. Guzman's class.

00:44.431 --> 00:45.721
What class are you in?

00:45.941 --> 00:47.887
I am in Mrs. Pollard's class.

00:48.228 --> 00:49.063
She is nice.

00:49.513 --> 00:50.719
Do you like her class?

00:50.994 --> 00:52.429
Yeah, she is cool.

00:52.702 --> 00:56.109
Now I am going to invite Joey to play on the playground.

00:56.523 --> 00:58.023
You don't have to do this.

00:58.491 --> 01:02.962
You may say something like, "Nice to meet you. See you around," and walk away.

01:03.215 --> 01:08.533
Or you can say, "See you around. Maybe we can hang out some time."

01:08.977 --> 01:12.731
For our demonstration, I am going to invite Joey to play.

01:13.254 --> 01:15.797
Do you want to play with me on the playground?

01:16.191 --> 01:16.562
Sure.

01:16.899 --> 01:17.599
Let's go.

01:23.791 --> 01:25.171
It was fun playing with you.

01:25.262 --> 01:26.405
We should be friends.

01:26.689 --> 01:28.344
I would love to be your friend.

01:28.766 --> 01:29.778
See you tomorrow.
