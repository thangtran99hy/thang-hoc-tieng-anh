ï»¿Hi!

00:10.363 --> 00:11.081
I'm Jade.

00:11.651 --> 00:12.099
I'm Nikki.

00:12.379 --> 00:12.750
Hi.

00:12.825 --> 00:13.060
Hi.

00:13.291 --> 00:15.969
I have never ever been in a ball pit before.

00:16.113 --> 00:16.506
What?

00:16.686 --> 00:17.659
You've never been in a ball pit?

00:17.727 --> 00:17.899
No.

00:18.241 --> 00:19.266
Okay, this is a good one.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.251
Share three things on your bucket list.

00:23.173 --> 00:24.773
The first one is to go skydiving.

00:25.013 --> 00:26.189
Actually, I play the drums.

00:26.296 --> 00:27.282
You play any instruments?

00:27.953 --> 00:29.332
I quit everything I ever tried.

00:29.893 --> 00:30.214
All right.

00:31.756 --> 00:33.583
Actually fun fact, these aren't real teeth.

00:37.383 --> 00:38.368
I have a flipper tooth.

00:38.452 --> 00:38.861
Really?

00:39.383 --> 00:39.963
Oh my god!

00:40.378 --> 00:41.271
No, no, no, I can't.

00:41.355 --> 00:41.524
Wait, wait, wait.

00:43.287 --> 00:43.696
What?

00:43.842 --> 00:44.705
My front tooth!

00:45.200 --> 00:45.914
Oh my gosh!

00:48.607 --> 00:49.523
You don't even understand.

00:49.704 --> 00:52.059
I swear to God I feel like someone planted us here for this reason.

00:52.149 --> 00:52.677
Destiny.

00:53.499 --> 00:55.637
Describe the first time you fell in love.

00:56.851 --> 00:57.839
I think it was kindergarten.

00:58.671 --> 01:00.934
I don't remember his name, but he was beautiful.

01:01.717 --> 01:03.429
I was in the Navy.

01:04.030 --> 01:05.175
You were in the Navy?

01:05.269 --> 01:06.561
And my husband was in the Navy.

01:07.333 --> 01:12.147
Long story short, before he ever kissed me or we were ever really together,...

01:12.217 --> 01:13.335
...he told me he loved me.

01:14.122 --> 01:16.923
24 years later, we're more in love...

01:17.022 --> 01:20.753
...and we're better friends than even from the very beginning.

01:21.083 --> 01:22.575
That's true love in its finest.
