00:00.498 --> 00:06.717
Image is powerful but also image is superficial.

00:08.211 --> 00:12.357
I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds.

00:13.173 --> 00:17.101
And in this picture, I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life.

00:18.292 --> 00:21.211
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer was telling me to arch my back...

00:21.302 --> 00:23.381
...and put my hand in that guy's hair.

00:26.313 --> 00:30.907
And of course, barring surgery or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work,...

00:31.730 --> 00:35.030
...there's very little that we can do to transform how we look.

00:35.494 --> 00:41.099
And how we look, though it is superficial and immutable, has a huge impact on our lives.

00:41.463 --> 00:45.761
If the photographer is right there and the light is right there, like a nice HMI,...

00:45.982 --> 00:47.679
...and the client says, "Cameron, we want a walking shot."

00:47.755 --> 00:50.974
Well then, this leg goes first, nice and long, this arm goes back, this arm goes forward,...

00:51.041 --> 00:53.977
...the head is at three quarters, and you just go back and forth. Just do that.

00:54.294 --> 00:59.258
And then you look back at your imaginary friends, 300, 400, 500 times.

01:01.177 --> 01:02.606
It will look something like this.

01:05.679 --> 01:07.645
Hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle.

01:07.709 --> 01:08.883
That was, I don't know what happened there.

01:10.835 --> 01:14.031
Unfortunately, after you've gone to school and you have a resume and you've done a few jobs,...

01:14.124 --> 01:15.640
...you can't say anything anymore.

01:15.720 --> 01:19.033
So if you say you want to be the President of the United States...

01:19.253 --> 01:22.643
...but your resume reads "Underwear Model: 10 years," people give you a funny look.

01:23.432 --> 01:25.792
The next question people always ask me is "Do they retouch all the photos?"

01:25.872 --> 01:27.545
And yeah, they pretty much retouch all the photos...

01:27.811 --> 01:30.861
...but that is only a small component of what's happening.

01:31.611 --> 01:33.788
This picture is the very first picture that I ever took...

01:34.163 --> 01:36.529
...and it's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini...

01:37.017 --> 01:38.916
...and I didn't even have my period yet.

01:39.025 --> 01:42.185
I know we're getting personal but you know, I was a young girl.

01:42.273 --> 01:45.418
This is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier.

01:46.612 --> 01:48.795
Here's me on the same day as this shoot.

01:48.879 --> 01:50.049
My friend got to come with me.

01:50.616 --> 01:53.480
Here's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue.

01:54.874 --> 01:57.007
Here's me on the soccer team and in V Magazine.

01:58.450 --> 01:59.643
And here's me today.

02:00.149 --> 02:03.988
And I hope what you're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me.

02:04.100 --> 02:08.766
They are constructions. And they are constructions by a group of professionals,...

02:08.861 --> 02:11.759
...by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and...

02:11.917 --> 02:15.344
...all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production, and they build this.

02:15.427 --> 02:16.080
That's not me.
