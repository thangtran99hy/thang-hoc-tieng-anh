I'm Naomi Shah, I'm 16 and I live in Portland, Oregon.

00:09.335 --> 00:13.779
I see science as a means of improving people's lives, of helping,...

00:14.056 --> 00:15.702
...and that's what's really important to me.

00:16.491 --> 00:17.730
I enjoy doing sports.

00:18.129 --> 00:18.920
I swim.

00:19.467 --> 00:22.983
One of the best things about swimming is you see yourself improve over time,...

00:23.184 --> 00:24.276
...and that's one of the things I love.

00:25.063 --> 00:29.165
My heritage is very important, and my family and I are very close.

00:30.632 --> 00:33.863
Both my dad and my brother have year-round allergy symptoms,...

00:34.149 --> 00:37.990
...and I wanted to understand the external factors that were exacerbating it.

00:39.165 --> 00:41.429
I guess that's what inspired my project.

00:42.939 --> 00:46.322
A lot of people don't realize that the air pollutants in their home...

00:46.669 --> 00:48.399
...might have an effect on their lung health.

00:49.052 --> 00:53.515
I've studied indoor air quality and the various ways it affects asthmatic patients.

00:53.949 --> 00:57.671
I was very surprised to find out that many of the factors I studied...

00:57.852 --> 01:00.752
...are not being addressed by air quality regulations.

01:01.161 --> 01:03.933
So I'm hoping to impact policy more directly.

01:04.800 --> 01:08.451
I recently met with Lisa Jackson, the administrator of the EPA,...

01:08.761 --> 01:11.527
...to discuss indoor air quality in our public buildings.

01:11.923 --> 01:14.790
Like schools and hospitals, and I'm planning to do more.

01:15.479 --> 01:18.147
My dream is to become an inventor and entrepreneur,...

01:18.249 --> 01:20.947
...with a passionate focus on environmental public health.

01:22.277 --> 01:25.887
It's hard for one person, especially a student, to make a difference,...

01:27.165 --> 01:31.740
...but I feel like the science fair has given me a platform I never would have had before.

01:32.570 --> 01:36.491
I want to make the world a better place and now I believe I can do it.
