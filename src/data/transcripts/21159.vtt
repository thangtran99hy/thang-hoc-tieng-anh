And today we're gonna talk about how to find more happiness in your life.

00:07.516 --> 00:09.955
Happiness is a state of well-being and joy.

00:10.416 --> 00:13.459
When you are feeling happy, everything in your life seems better.

00:13.925 --> 00:16.074
So how do you find more happiness?

00:16.581 --> 00:20.805
First, spend time each day thinking about how you want your day to be.

00:21.395 --> 00:22.620
What do you wanna do?

00:23.183 --> 00:24.389
How do you wanna feel?

00:25.000 --> 00:27.885
How will you find joy in everything you do?

00:28.676 --> 00:31.888
Take extra time each day to visualize what you want.

00:32.150 --> 00:37.377
You will be amazed at how much fun and joy, you will be aware of throughout your day.

00:38.127 --> 00:40.217
Second, take care of your body.

00:40.697 --> 00:43.588
It is hard to feel happy if your body feels miserable.

00:44.463 --> 00:48.145
Spend time each day eating foods packed with nutrition.

00:48.775 --> 00:52.871
Plan your meals ahead of time so that you will be less inclined to eat junk food.

00:53.524 --> 00:56.239
Also plan when you're gonna exercise.

00:56.722 --> 00:59.803
In order to make sure your body will function fully for you...

01:00.093 --> 01:02.158
...make sure you are using it well.

01:02.661 --> 01:07.943
Daily walks are a nice way to get your exercise in and enjoy nature at the same time.

01:08.685 --> 01:11.348
You will feel better and be happier because of it.

01:12.201 --> 01:14.194
Third, focus on the solution.

01:14.657 --> 01:16.155
Life is full of challenges...

01:16.250 --> 01:20.193
...and I can guarantee that if you are looking for a problem you will find it.

01:20.713 --> 01:24.239
However it is not the problem that defines a situation.

01:24.656 --> 01:26.121
It is how you handle it.

01:26.658 --> 01:30.867
You will be so much happier if you focus on the solution instead of the problem.

01:31.747 --> 01:35.564
When you focus on the problem, all you will see is more problems.

01:36.033 --> 01:38.080
However when you focus on the solution,...

01:38.438 --> 01:42.235
...you will begin to see the opportunities to make the situation better.
