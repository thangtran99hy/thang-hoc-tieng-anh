Carved by the classical sculptor Phidias in 435 B.C.,...

00:06.008 --> 00:09.488
...the Statue of Zeus sat in the ancient town of Olympia, Greece.

00:09.655 --> 00:14.681
A simple temple did not seem good enough for the King of Gods, Zeus, so this statue was built.

00:14.908 --> 00:18.734
It stood 40 feet tall, and Zeus sat on a throne of cedar wood...

00:18.913 --> 00:22.710
...and in his right hand was a small statue of Nike, the goddess of victory.

00:22.961 --> 00:25.683
It now attracted tourists from all over the world.

00:25.906 --> 00:28.515
It is at debate how the statue was destroyed.

00:28.659 --> 00:33.406
Some say it remained in the temple until the 5th century A.D. when the temple was destroyed,...

00:33.503 --> 00:37.954
...while others say it was carried away to Constantinople where it was destroyed in a fire.

00:38.358 --> 00:43.199
However, in 1958, the workshop of the Statue of Zeus was discovered...

00:43.411 --> 00:47.784
...and here, many secrets into the building of the statue were also found out.
