Millions of of South Koreans will be on the move this weekend...

00:03.847 --> 00:07.189
...as the country celebrates "Chuseok," the Korean thanksgiving holiday.

00:07.560 --> 00:11.618
Chuseok is South Korea's biggest holiday, when Koreans reunite with families...

00:11.699 --> 00:15.816
...to celebrate a good harvest and pay respects to their elders and ancestors.

00:16.143 --> 00:19.897
And as with any holiday, there are lots of traditional foods prepared.

00:21.782 --> 00:25.117
These foreign students have come to Korea to study the language.

00:25.612 --> 00:27.647
They're also learning how to cook "songpyeon"...

00:27.992 --> 00:33.233
...because they know how important it is to Koreans during Chuseok, which is Korean Thanksgiving Day.

00:33.879 --> 00:35.769
Songpyeon is a type of rice cake.

00:36.346 --> 00:41.675
It's made by kneading rice powder with hot water and stuffing the dough with healthy ingredients...

00:42.070 --> 00:45.188
...like beans, sesame, chestnuts and other fillings

00:45.807 --> 00:48.475
The songpyeon is steamed for about 20 to 30 minutes.

00:48.720 --> 00:52.888
Now in the past, what was special about songpyeon was that it was steamed together with pine leaves.

00:53.223 --> 00:55.445
But these days, that's no longer the case.

00:56.503 --> 00:58.261
According to the cooking instructor,...

00:58.565 --> 01:03.017
...pine needles are not as fresh as they used to be because of rising pollution.

01:03.887 --> 01:07.534
After steaming, it's important to rinse the rice cakes in cold water.

01:08.481 --> 01:10.565
Another special feature about the rice cake....

01:10.879 --> 01:14.754
...is that the skin used to wrap the filling looks like a full moon.

01:15.571 --> 01:19.425
But when it's cooked and ready to eat, it resembles a half moon.

01:20.275 --> 01:24.689
It's common on the eve of Chuseok for family members to gather around the table...

01:24.905 --> 01:28.046
...to make the most perfectly shaped rice cakes possible.

01:28.848 --> 01:34.435
They say if you make pretty songpyeon, you will find a beautiful partner or have a beautiful baby.

01:35.335 --> 01:39.123
But for these students, perfection was not in their minds.

01:39.650 --> 01:43.565
Some even have their own ideas of what songpyeon should look like.

01:44.533 --> 01:48.205
Whatever the shape, this rice cake will always be a traditional food...

01:48.518 --> 01:51.900
...enjoyed by all Koreans during the Chuseok holidays.
