I think that what I love about New York City, there's a little bit of everything.

00:11.224 --> 00:14.687
And every day when you get up and walk to school,...

00:15.275 --> 00:18.265
...you might see something you've never seen before.

00:20.486 --> 00:21.929
I love exploring.

00:22.580 --> 00:24.229
Every street is different.

00:24.829 --> 00:28.172
You're experiencing the real world with the college life.

00:29.223 --> 00:31.468
What I love about New York is the diversity.

00:32.339 --> 00:33.719
I like everything mixed together.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.603
When I'm walking on the street I don't wanna see one of the few things.

00:37.722 --> 00:40.075
I wanna see things that I don't even know what I'm seeing.

00:44.831 --> 00:47.244
New Yorkers are busy not unfriendly.

00:48.437 --> 00:50.324
They're really kind people and they know what's up.

00:54.851 --> 00:57.277
What I find is that a lot of people that grew up...

00:57.381 --> 01:02.263
...in those towns with triple-digit populations and everything...

01:02.355 --> 01:03.182
...and then they come here.

01:04.449 --> 01:05.268
They stay here.

01:07.825 --> 01:10.300
I love this city and I'll always love this city...

01:10.391 --> 01:12.057
...and it's going to be a part of me forever.
