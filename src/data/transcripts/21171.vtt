The metro is the most efficient way to get around.

00:03.089 --> 00:05.589
And it shows a real local side to Paris.

00:05.976 --> 00:08.131
Take a ride from one side of town to the other...

00:08.500 --> 00:10.607
...and you'll feel the diversity of the city.

00:11.611 --> 00:15.005
But do note Parisians think it is rude to make eye contact...

00:15.364 --> 00:17.854
...or even smile with strangers in the metro.

00:18.358 --> 00:21.369
And it is impolite to talk loudly among your friends.

00:22.206 --> 00:25.807
Follow those rules and you'll have a more authentic experience.

00:27.199 --> 00:31.107
To buy a ticket for the metro, you can buy one ride for a euro 70.

00:31.287 --> 00:36.300
Or you can buy a billet en carnet for ten tickets at a euro 25 each.

00:36.723 --> 00:41.093
Those tickets work on the bus too, in case you like to travel above ground.

00:41.729 --> 00:44.483
And of course you can always splurge on taxis...

00:44.793 --> 00:46.101
...but if your French is rusty...

00:46.424 --> 00:50.283
...be sure to have your destination written down in French on a piece of paper.

00:52.168 --> 00:56.449
All right, let's talk about my favorite form of transportation in Paris...

00:56.885 --> 01:00.161
...and that is the public bike system called Velib.

01:00.787 --> 01:05.668
There are close to 1800 Velib docking stations, like this one, all around the city...

01:05.778 --> 01:08.641
...with 20,000 bikes in circulation.

01:08.813 --> 01:11.761
That means every 1,000 feet there's a station.

01:12.191 --> 01:14.857
You can purchase a one-day or seven-day pass...

01:15.314 --> 01:19.495
...but sometimes non-European credit cards don't work at the consoles.

01:19.739 --> 01:22.774
So to be safe, I'd book online in advance.
