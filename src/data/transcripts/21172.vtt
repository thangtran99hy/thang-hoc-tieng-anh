00:05.637 --> 00:08.058
In the US, the thumbs-up sign means "well done,..."

00:08.503 --> 00:10.170
...or is commonly used by hitchhikers.

00:10.659 --> 00:13.985
But don't use it in Greece, Russia, Sardinia or West Africa...

00:14.485 --> 00:17.559
...because you'll be insulting the recipient with a hearty "up yours."

00:18.963 --> 00:19.827
Be careful with this.

00:21.142 --> 00:24.335
In the US, this sign means everything is hunky-dory.

00:24.903 --> 00:27.965
But in Russia, Brazil, Turkey and the Mediterranean,...

00:28.411 --> 00:29.727
...it means something very different,...

00:30.325 --> 00:33.033
...something along the lines of, "You are a homosexual."

00:33.682 --> 00:37.142
In France and Belgium, it means the recipient is a worthless zero.

00:38.677 --> 00:42.975
If you're in Greece, don't tell someone to stop by also holding up your hand...

00:43.285 --> 00:45.309
...palm out in all five fingers at attention...

00:46.045 --> 00:47.961
...you'd be telling them to go straight to hell.

00:49.509 --> 00:52.251
Jenna Bush was televised flashing this symbol in Norway...

00:52.363 --> 00:53.654
...to show her pride for Texas,...

00:54.388 --> 00:58.238
...not realizing that she was inadvertently telling the entire Mediterranean...

00:58.543 --> 01:00.285
...that their spouses were being unfaithful.

01:00.951 --> 01:06.514
The sign means "cuckold" and is popular in Spain, Portugal, Greece, Colombia,...

01:06.892 --> 01:09.495
...Brazil, Albania and Slovakia.

01:11.141 --> 01:15.555
If you go to the Philippines, whatever you do don't tell someone to "come here..."

01:16.042 --> 01:19.206
...by curling your finger forward and motioning repeatedly...

01:19.597 --> 01:21.026
...unless you want to get arrested.

01:21.295 --> 01:24.722
It's considered to be a gesture befitting only usage on a dog...

01:25.039 --> 01:27.722
...and is punishable with jail time if used on a person.

01:29.309 --> 01:33.709
Placing both hands out, palms down, fingers outstretched to settle a crowd...

01:33.787 --> 01:36.625
...or to tell people to wait is commonplace in the US.

01:37.605 --> 01:40.522
So be careful using those seven hand gestures abroad.
