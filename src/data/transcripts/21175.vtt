00:07.909 --> 00:10.033
Hong Kong bustles at any time of year,...

00:10.148 --> 00:14.828
...but the Mid-Autumn Festival brings out the best and brightest of this vibrant city.

00:21.128 --> 00:23.999
The celebration is also known as the Moon Festival,...

00:24.105 --> 00:27.295
...and the traditional dessert is exchanged as holiday gifts.

00:27.484 --> 00:30.123
Modern mooncakes come in all shapes and flavors,...

00:30.233 --> 00:34.217
...but purists prefer thin-crusted cakes made with lotus seed paste...

00:34.331 --> 00:37.267
...and salted egg yolks that symbolize the full moon.

00:38.985 --> 00:42.489
Chinese lanterns are also integral to the party atmosphere.

00:43.063 --> 00:48.382
Local artist and master Chan creates festive masterpieces with nothing more than bamboo,...

00:48.733 --> 00:51.519
...colored paper and a fertile imagination.

00:53.046 --> 00:55.811
For kids, the festival's a chance to stay up late...

00:56.154 --> 00:58.949
...and marvel at the citywide display of lanterns.

01:01.699 --> 01:06.251
The fire dragon dances are arguably the hottest attraction of the entire festival.

01:06.373 --> 01:11.450
The 220-foot-long dragon winds its way through the Tai Hang neighborhood...

01:11.557 --> 01:13.986
...amid much fanfare and scented smoke.

01:15.166 --> 01:20.863
The three-day dance was originally performed to drive plague from Tang Hai in the 19th century.

01:27.656 --> 01:32.791
It's noisy and it's smoky, but this holiday will not fail to ignite all your senses.
