00:02.879 --> 00:04.639
Scientists believe they have an explanation...

00:04.745 --> 00:07.856
...for the mysterious, bare and grassless patches called "fairy circles"...

00:07.941 --> 00:11.456
...that appear regularly throughout the Namib desert in Namibia and South Africa.

00:11.640 --> 00:12.463
And surprise!

00:12.573 --> 00:13.576
It's not fairies.

00:13.919 --> 00:16.119
Biologist Norbert Juergens suggests termites,...

00:16.199 --> 00:18.833
...the only creatures found consistently at the majority of the patches...

00:18.981 --> 00:20.475
...are responsible for the formations.

00:20.841 --> 00:23.542
Study in water content and consistency of the circles' soil,...

00:23.648 --> 00:25.712
...as well as forged plant material under the surface,...

00:26.004 --> 00:29.180
...Juergens concluded that termites consume the roots of the grass within the circle,...

00:29.274 --> 00:31.907
...causing the clearing while letting the grass at the rim survive.

00:32.135 --> 00:35.074
His theory does not, however explain why the patches are circle-shaped,...

00:35.167 --> 00:37.315
...so the theory still has holes as it were.

00:37.653 --> 00:40.067
Furthermore, termites are usually known to enrich soil,...

00:40.204 --> 00:42.631
...making it more hospitable for plants, not less.

00:42.821 --> 00:45.546
So wait, did we officially rule out this fairy thing yet?
