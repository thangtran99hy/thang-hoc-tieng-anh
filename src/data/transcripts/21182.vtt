You want to always make sure that your guests are at ease,...

00:03.720 --> 00:05.281
...and the only way to do that, I think,...

00:05.353 --> 00:07.196
...is if you kind of pull them into the process.

00:07.321 --> 00:10.367
For example, the new girlfriend of a friend who nobody knows,...

00:10.490 --> 00:12.143
...I have her come in the kitchen,...

00:12.533 --> 00:16.503
...help me sort of rip up some bread or prepare hors d'oeuvres.

00:16.589 --> 00:19.569
And that way, she gets involved, we start talking,...

00:19.663 --> 00:20.715
...it takes a lot of the pressure off.

00:20.791 --> 00:25.391
She gets the idea that we're trying to produce something beautiful,...

00:25.506 --> 00:27.225
...but it is not make-or-break.
