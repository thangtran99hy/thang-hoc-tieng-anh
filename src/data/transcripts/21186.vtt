ï»¿The public transportation in Switzerland is just incredible.

00:08.506 --> 00:10.741
The ticket system is based on the honor system.

00:10.843 --> 00:15.307
So after you buy an all-day pass or a one-hour ticket, that's it, you're done.

00:15.539 --> 00:18.149
No one's standing there to check your ticket at the door.

00:18.233 --> 00:20.634
Just hop onto the bus or tram and you're good to go.

00:20.857 --> 00:22.850
I was just baffled by this.

00:22.981 --> 00:26.021
Obviously, some people take advantage and don't pay for tickets,...

00:26.142 --> 00:28.929
...but that's why they do occasionally have workers checking for tickets.

00:29.125 --> 00:32.441
A whole ten days of traveling around and we never got checked once.

00:32.564 --> 00:34.937
I've heard you can go years without being checked.

00:35.308 --> 00:37.995
But the one day you figure it's safe to not buy a ticket...

00:38.094 --> 00:39.437
...because you're only going a short distance...

00:39.573 --> 00:42.045
...would of course be the day there are two guys on the tram...

00:42.292 --> 00:44.134
...waiting for you to check your ticket.

00:44.389 --> 00:47.691
And it's a very serious 100-franc fine if you get caught.

00:47.806 --> 00:50.676
So, don't get caught.
