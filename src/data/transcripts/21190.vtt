ï»¿Hey, this is Abraham for Samsung Tomorrow TV and I'm at the Samsung...

00:10.674 --> 00:11.915
Just five more minutes, you're not my mom.

00:13.497 --> 00:14.320
All right, fine!

00:15.379 --> 00:15.559
Hey!

00:15.965 --> 00:18.063
This is the Samsung Mobile Console.

00:18.955 --> 00:22.821
It's designed for the Galaxy Note 3 and it turns your Note 3 into an even better gaming device.

00:23.747 --> 00:24.273
Excuse me.

00:24.651 --> 00:26.277
This works with other devices too, right?

00:28.521 --> 00:29.181
So it does!

00:29.957 --> 00:31.275
So, let me show how this works.

00:31.441 --> 00:33.537
It has a clamp on the top for your devices.

00:34.183 --> 00:37.221
So you can place your Galaxy Note 3 in the clamp.

00:37.712 --> 00:40.467
Press the game button and it brings up the games that it has...

00:40.543 --> 00:43.739
...so you can just pick between those and just go.

00:53.857 --> 00:57.260
So the larger the screen, the better the gaming experience, right?

00:57.641 --> 01:01.827
So Samsung put together something called Smart Dock or the Multimedia Dock.

01:02.198 --> 01:07.315
This hooks up your mobile console through that dock into the TV...

01:08.045 --> 01:11.632
...so the dock and the controller are put together by Bluetooth...

01:12.177 --> 01:17.093
...and the dock feeds HDMI into the TV so you can have it on the big screen.

01:17.643 --> 01:21.673
Samsung is all about integrating technology, and this is just pure awesomeness.

01:22.627 --> 01:25.684
So, Abraham for Samsung Tomorrow TV, I'll see you next time.
