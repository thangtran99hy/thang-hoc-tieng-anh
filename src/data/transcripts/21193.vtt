ï»¿Nintendo visionary Hiroshi Yamauchi has died at the age of 85.

00:06.732 --> 00:10.165
He passed away Thursday from pneumonia at a hospital in central Japan.

00:10.577 --> 00:16.217
Yamauchi transformed Nintendo from a small card playing company into a video game giant.

00:16.705 --> 00:19.783
He led the company for more than 50 years, serving as its CEO.

00:20.211 --> 00:24.443
He was once the richest man in Japan with a net worth of more than five billion dollars.

00:24.725 --> 00:28.838
He oversaw some of the most successful and revolutionary game consoles of his time.

00:29.144 --> 00:31.809
We all remember the Super Nintendo in 1991,...

00:32.211 --> 00:37.955
....the Game Boy, the first mainstream portable gamer, and the Nintendo 64, the first 3D console.

00:38.345 --> 00:42.497
We'll also remember the iconic games Nintendo brought to households around the world.

00:42.898 --> 00:46.841
Games like Super Mario, Zelda and Donkey Kong were legendary.

00:47.081 --> 00:50.169
Not only was he famous for the games and consoles he helped pioneer,...

00:50.279 --> 00:54.191
...but perhaps one of his greatest achievements was the N64 controller.

00:54.535 --> 00:57.328
It was the first to include a joystick alongside buttons.

00:57.411 --> 01:00.859
It was highly praised and became the model for future gaming consoles.

01:01.353 --> 01:03.931
An editor for Computer and Video Games magazine said...

01:04.410 --> 01:07.652
..."You cannot overestimate the influence the man had on the games industry."

01:07.943 --> 01:10.829
The company said a funeral for Yamauchi will take place Sunday.

01:11.025 --> 01:13.745
