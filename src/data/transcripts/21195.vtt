00:07.123 --> 00:07.698
You ready?

00:10.471 --> 00:12.679
This is Detective Alex Murphy, officer down!

00:13.875 --> 00:16.808
We are on the eve of a technological revolution.

00:20.339 --> 00:22.277
We need a product with a conscience.

00:24.353 --> 00:25.212
Give your mom a kiss.

00:25.422 --> 00:25.991
Good night, baby.

00:26.084 --> 00:27.075
Too slow, boy!

00:33.845 --> 00:35.695
We're gonna put a man inside a machine.

00:39.443 --> 00:42.959
He's suffered fourth degree burns over 80% of his body.

00:43.734 --> 00:48.678
If he survives, he'll be paralyzed from the waist down, confined to a wheelchair.

00:49.121 --> 00:51.187
You say you could save him, but what does that mean?

00:52.549 --> 00:54.142
What kind of life will he have?

00:56.653 --> 00:58.342
What kind of suit is this?

00:58.544 --> 00:59.667
It's not a suit.

00:59.759 --> 01:00.413
It's you.

01:00.527 --> 01:01.502
What the hell did you do to me?

01:04.867 --> 01:06.211
Make him more tactical.

01:06.311 --> 01:06.950
Make him look...

01:08.131 --> 01:08.985
Let's go with black.

01:13.577 --> 01:16.257
I've selected 13 targets, all wanted for murder.

01:18.343 --> 01:20.348
This is the future of justice.

01:25.062 --> 01:25.762
Alex!

01:26.648 --> 01:28.249
You need to speak to your son.

01:39.601 --> 01:42.918
Somehow, he's overriding the system's priorities.

01:43.187 --> 01:44.931
The human element will always be present.

01:45.015 --> 01:46.721
Compassion, fear, instinct.

01:46.795 --> 01:48.688
They will always interfere with the system.

01:54.058 --> 01:57.235
Dead or alive, you're coming with me.
