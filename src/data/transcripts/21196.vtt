00:03.629 --> 00:05.908
Former Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi died today.

00:06.008 --> 00:06.949
He was 85.

00:07.295 --> 00:11.742
Yamauchi  was the 3rd president of Nintendo, taking the position in 1949 while in his early 20s.

00:11.872 --> 00:14.515
At that time, Nintendo was mostly manufacturing playing cards.

00:14.691 --> 00:17.154
Under Yamauchi's leadership, the company entered the electronics market,...

00:17.240 --> 00:19.335
...and became a global leader in the video game industry.

00:19.773 --> 00:23.995
In the 70s, Nintendo started creating toys and opening amusement shooting galleries around Japan.

00:24.567 --> 00:26.491
Yamauchi was almost 50 when Pong was released,...

00:26.585 --> 00:28.842
...and he inked a deal to distribute home Pong machines.

00:29.065 --> 00:31.564
The next step was for Nintendo to start creating its own video games,...

00:31.695 --> 00:34.121
...which led to the Famicom and the Nintendo Entertainment System.

00:34.677 --> 00:38.773
Yamauchi oversaw a time of incredible profit for Nintendo during the 8 and 16-bit eras,...

00:38.887 --> 00:41.933
...although the company faced challenges and stiff competition during the 90s.

00:42.311 --> 00:45.605
He was succeeded by current Nintendo president Satoru Iwata in 2002.

00:45.791 --> 00:48.033
Yamauchi  continued to serve as a special adviser.

00:48.418 --> 00:53.383
He retired at 75, but still came up with the idea for the Nintendo DS while serving as chairman of the board.
