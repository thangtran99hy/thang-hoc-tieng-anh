It is by observing the world around them and having conversations with adults...

00:13.755 --> 00:15.278
...that children learn to communicate.

00:16.739 --> 00:19.695
As caregivers, we are a child's first teachers.

00:20.281 --> 00:24.664
And because having strong speaking and listening skills is key to being an early reader,...

00:25.210 --> 00:27.249
...this makes our job incredibly important.

00:30.138 --> 00:32.839
So what can we do to prepare strong readers?

00:34.168 --> 00:38.763
When having conversations with children, we should ask open-ended questions.

00:39.455 --> 00:41.833
Ones that require more than a yes or no answer.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.410
Listen, wait and observe.

00:46.519 --> 00:49.140
Have patience and give the child time to respond.

00:50.145 --> 00:51.817
Build on what was said or observed.

00:52.791 --> 00:56.142
Repeat, rephrase or expand on the child's response.

00:57.751 --> 01:00.799
These three techniques can be done anywhere at any time.

01:01.522 --> 01:02.967
Let's see some examples.

01:03.793 --> 01:05.341
They have animals with them.

01:06.208 --> 01:07.929
What kind of animals do you see with them?

01:12.921 --> 01:15.842
Yes, there's a monkey, a butterfly.

01:15.944 --> 01:17.090
What else do you see?

01:19.364 --> 01:20.166
What's that?

01:20.560 --> 01:20.824
A fish.

01:20.899 --> 01:21.831
A fish!

01:21.939 --> 01:22.837
You're right.

01:22.919 --> 01:23.735
You want to see the book?

01:23.810 --> 01:24.745
Watch.

01:27.451 --> 01:29.211
Do you like that story?

01:31.397 --> 01:34.118
Sometimes it feels like a one-way conversation.

01:35.298 --> 01:38.638
But notice that by being patient and building on what is observed,...

01:39.133 --> 01:42.827
...the child still participates even if they don't use words.

01:43.191 --> 01:44.351
Very good.

01:44.427 --> 01:46.443
That's a very good circle.

01:46.841 --> 01:48.523
And what else are you going to draw?

01:48.614 --> 01:50.553
What are you gonna do with this circle?

01:54.461 --> 01:55.385
Rayona?

01:56.215 --> 01:58.343
Do you know what you're gonna do with this circle?

02:01.091 --> 02:04.085
You made a bigger circle.

02:04.642 --> 02:06.177
What color is your circle?

02:09.363 --> 02:11.511
That's close, it's purple.
