Once you're into the mall proper, the disorientation techniques kick in.

00:03.649 --> 00:08.258
The most obvious things to look out for are: Number one, there are no clocks in here.

00:08.341 --> 00:12.229
Number two, you rarely ever see the outside world clearly from the inside.

00:12.442 --> 00:15.539
They're both classic methods for skewing your perception of time.

00:15.793 --> 00:19.225
Next, the lighting and color schemes are both harsh and bright,...

00:19.387 --> 00:22.673
...the floor is tiled and reflective, which also means it's loud in here...

00:22.739 --> 00:25.601
...with that muzak and people talking and kids yelling.

00:25.717 --> 00:29.771
All of the designs make you yearn for the relative comfort of a store.

00:30.189 --> 00:33.206
You probably turn right as soon as you enter 'cause that's what most people do.

00:33.347 --> 00:36.317
In fact, so many of us do it they actually call it the invariant right.

00:36.567 --> 00:40.717
That's why all the bargain bins, specials, and recommended books and DVDs are always here.

00:40.935 --> 00:42.867
It's much nicer in here.

00:42.940 --> 00:48.899
The lighting is calmer, the music is quieter, the carpet is soft like a baby zebra.

00:49.096 --> 00:50.855
It all makes you feel just a little bit more open...

00:50.913 --> 00:54.851
...to the idea of spending three grand on a flat-screen TV.
