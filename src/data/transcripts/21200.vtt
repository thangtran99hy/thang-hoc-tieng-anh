Hey, what's the story?

00:05.188 --> 00:06.669
Oh, okay.

00:07.785 --> 00:08.377
Third date.

00:09.027 --> 00:11.181
First one was okay, second one was bad.

00:11.487 --> 00:14.271
She's giving him one more chance to prove that he's not boring.

00:14.858 --> 00:16.073
And he is not succeeding.

00:16.823 --> 00:21.156
Hi, I have a potato on my fork.

00:21.773 --> 00:24.472
I like to eat potatoes;...

00:24.998 --> 00:31.397
...they're delicious, but I don't actually ever put them in my mouth.

00:34.153 --> 00:39.049
That's amazing, Jeremy, but I'm gonna go home now and fart into a shoebox.
