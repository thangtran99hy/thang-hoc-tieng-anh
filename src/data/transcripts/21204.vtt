00:00.313 --> 00:00.919
I'm gonna take a nap.

00:01.229 --> 00:01.695
Awesome.

00:02.098 --> 00:05.753
Naps have been proven to make some people more alert and give their brains a power boost.

00:06.693 --> 00:09.369
If you're not experiencing those results, you might be doing it wrong.

00:10.180 --> 00:12.269
Sleep scientists say that there's a right way to nap,...

00:12.533 --> 00:16.609
...and understanding the body's natural sleep cycle is a key factor in reaping the benefits.

00:17.404 --> 00:21.278
There are two kinds of sleep which together last approximately 90 to 120 minutes,...

00:21.623 --> 00:25.133
...namely non-rapid eye movement followed by rapid eye movement.

00:25.883 --> 00:28.697
During non-rapid eye movement, you experience two phases.

00:28.950 --> 00:32.747
The first is light and intermediate, and the second is a deep slow-wave sleep.

00:33.134 --> 00:36.337
Wake up during a deep sleep, and you may take some time to feel alert.

00:37.077 --> 00:40.783
Rapid eye movement is where dreams happen, and if you're experiencing that in a brief nap,...

00:40.922 --> 00:43.364
...you've got a bigger problem because that means you're sleep deprived.

00:43.992 --> 00:47.710
Experts say that 10 to 20 minutes is the right duration to make a person feel awake.

00:48.411 --> 00:50.428
The next increments are 60 and 90 minutes,...

00:50.531 --> 00:53.661
...as those are in sync with the stage duration of the sleep cycle.

00:54.441 --> 00:58.251
Regardless of the duration, it's best if the nap occurs between 1 and 4 PM...

00:58.340 --> 01:00.427
...in line with your body's natural circadian rhythms.
