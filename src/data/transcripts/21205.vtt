Life forms can exist on Earth in extreme conditions like ice cores, caves,...

00:06.713 --> 00:08.252
...and in the deepest parts of the ocean.

00:08.978 --> 00:12.567
Scientific researchers from the British Antarctic Survey have found what they believe...

00:12.674 --> 00:15.781
...to be the lowest temperature under which life can still survive and grow.

00:16.559 --> 00:20.244
To test this, the researchers put single cell organisms in a watery environment...

00:20.464 --> 00:23.461
...and lowered the temperature to see when the organisms became vitrified,...

00:23.612 --> 00:27.309
...or unable to reproduce, which the scientists considered to be no longer living.

00:27.865 --> 00:30.735
The researchers determined that negative 20 degrees Celsius...

00:30.836 --> 00:34.579
...is the lowest temperature the organisms could reproduce before becoming vitrified.

00:35.132 --> 00:37.263
Lead author of the study, Professor Andrew Clarke said:...

00:37.607 --> 00:41.239
..."The interesting thing about vitrification is that in general a cell will survive,...

00:41.368 --> 00:42.571
...where it wouldn't survive freezing."

00:42.927 --> 00:45.618
But if you can do a controlled vitrification you can survive.

00:45.941 --> 00:50.484
Once a cell is vitrified it can continue to survive right down to incredibly low temperatures.

00:51.268 --> 00:54.388
The results of the study help explain why deep freezing food preserves it...

00:54.506 --> 00:58.850
...and stops it from rotting, because bacteria and mold cannot multiply in such cold temperatures.
