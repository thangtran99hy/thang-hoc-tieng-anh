00:00.539 --> 00:02.151
When did you know that grandma was the one?

00:02.672 --> 00:03.587
When her sister dumped me.

00:04.567 --> 00:06.011
Grandpa, was my dad a good athlete?

00:06.685 --> 00:07.103
No.

00:07.597 --> 00:09.402
Oh dad, you remember my friend Alex?

00:09.653 --> 00:10.109
Yeah.

00:10.447 --> 00:11.400
The one that had the work done.

00:12.169 --> 00:12.897
Good to see you.

00:13.148 --> 00:14.213
Where do we go when we die?

00:14.547 --> 00:15.021
The ground.

00:16.045 --> 00:17.083
Who's your girlfriend?

00:17.963 --> 00:18.811
His name is Chad.

00:19.191 --> 00:20.892
And that's where babies come from.

00:21.330 --> 00:23.494
Sometimes being too transparent can be a bad thing.

00:23.843 --> 00:24.555
This looks good.

00:24.831 --> 00:26.907
But not with the Oscar Mayer Deli Fresh clear pack.

00:27.264 --> 00:28.875
It's what you see is what you get food.

00:29.100 --> 00:29.815
It's Oscar Mayer.
