Uh-oh. Guess what day it is?

00:03.146 --> 00:05.069
Guess what day it is?

00:06.073 --> 00:06.653
Anybody?

00:07.023 --> 00:08.873
Julie, hey. Guess what day it is?

00:09.380 --> 00:10.695
Come on, I know you can hear me.

00:11.033 --> 00:12.845
Mike. What day is it, Mike?

00:14.403 --> 00:15.732
Leslie, guess what today is?

00:17.029 --> 00:17.761
It's hump day.

00:19.360 --> 00:22.149
Bonnie, how happy are folks  who save hundreds of dollars switching to GEICO?

00:23.073 --> 00:24.931
I'd say happier than a camel on Wednesday.

00:25.042 --> 00:26.085
Hump day!

00:26.139 --> 00:27.465
Get happy, get GEICO.

00:27.582 --> 00:29.920
15 minutes could save you 15 percent or more.
