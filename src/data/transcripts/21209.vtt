Clothing is more than just decoration to the body or protection from the elements.

00:05.861 --> 00:10.217
Clothes have powers over your mind.

00:12.164 --> 00:15.960
Scientists have demonstrated this in experiments in which they divided people into two groups.

00:16.315 --> 00:22.604
Group A wore their normal street clothes while Group B wore their normal clothes and lab coats.

00:22.903 --> 00:25.740
When those people went on to perform tests of mental agility...

00:26.120 --> 00:31.101
...the group wearing lab coats made about half as many mistakes as the group not wearing lab coats.

00:32.279 --> 00:37.077
Stranger still, in a similar experiment in which both groups wore lab coats,...

00:37.236 --> 00:39.365
...but one was told they were wearing painters' smocks...

00:39.474 --> 00:41.953
...and the other told they were wearing doctors' coats,...

00:42.210 --> 00:45.938
...the doctors' clothes group performed much better in brain games...

00:46.276 --> 00:47.879
...than did the painters' clothes group.

00:49.043 --> 00:52.747
Scientists call this weird phenomenon "enclothed cognition"...

00:52.933 --> 00:56.040
...and they say it depends on both the symbolic meaning of the clothing...

00:56.175 --> 00:59.168
...and the psychological experience of wearing the clothes,...

00:59.250 --> 01:01.621
...constantly reminding you of what those clothes represent.

01:02.072 --> 01:05.836
The symbolic power of a white coat changes depending on what you call it.

01:06.172 --> 01:12.985
And then wearing it prepares you to be more attentive, or more careful, or more artistic.

01:13.426 --> 01:18.290
That feeling can then translate into actual changes in your behavior and performance,...

01:18.438 --> 01:19.763
...depending on the situation.

01:20.196 --> 01:24.764
So remember, the clothes you wear don't just change the way other people see you.

01:25.114 --> 01:27.409
They change the way you see yourself.

01:27.818 --> 01:31.144
And wearing certain kinds of clothes can affect the way you behave...

01:31.327 --> 01:33.575
...and even change the way you think.

01:34.113 --> 01:38.110
That means wearing a pair of glasses not only makes you look smart...

01:38.446 --> 01:44.353
...it also makes you feel and act like you are now less dumb.
