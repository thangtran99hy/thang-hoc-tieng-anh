Planning a business lunch with a client, coworker or boss?

00:03.331 --> 00:05.579
Well, here are a few things to consider before you do.

00:05.773 --> 00:07.071
You must know the restaurant.

00:07.308 --> 00:08.967
If you're inviting a client for lunch...

00:09.146 --> 00:11.599
...then it should definitely not be your first visit to the restaurant.

00:12.136 --> 00:13.297
Be familiar with the seating.

00:13.561 --> 00:18.047
Ask if it's possible to reserve a certain table away from the restroom, kitchens or front door.

00:19.302 --> 00:20.975
Introduce yourself to the maitre d'.

00:21.327 --> 00:22.703
Know him or her by name.

00:23.098 --> 00:25.049
Know what the noise level's like at lunchtime.

00:25.479 --> 00:28.876
You don't wanna have to shout or raise your voice when speaking about a sensitive deal.

00:29.777 --> 00:32.890
Also, you don't want to take a vegetarian to a steak house.

00:33.287 --> 00:38.169
If anything, you'll be the one making the sacrifice over the meal choices, not your client or boss.

00:39.403 --> 00:41.527
Eat first, talk business after.

00:41.791 --> 00:42.788
Have a little small talk.

00:42.984 --> 00:43.902
Get to know each other.

00:44.458 --> 00:47.910
Then dive into business before the meal or after dessert.

00:48.210 --> 00:51.158
If your client wants to dive right in, by all means, do so.

00:52.221 --> 00:53.965
A few things to remember about the table.

00:54.835 --> 00:57.803
Pass the salt and pepper together; they are married.

00:59.104 --> 01:03.357
Do not touch your nose, teeth, mouth, hair or head at the table.

01:04.087 --> 01:08.337
Leave your handbag, keys, cell phone, notes, folders off the table.

01:08.670 --> 01:13.283
If you're expecting a call relevant to your meeting, notify the table prior to starting lunch.

01:13.689 --> 01:16.946
After using sugar, place the packets underneath the saucer...

01:17.263 --> 01:19.019
...and don't tuck the napkin in your shirt.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.248
It must always be placed on your lap.

01:21.689 --> 01:24.579
Don't push your plate away or start stacking for the waitstaff.

01:24.715 --> 01:28.862
If it's a large party, wait until five or six people have been served then you may begin.

01:29.799 --> 01:32.359
If passing food, offer to your neighbor first.

01:32.951 --> 01:34.545
And remember, enjoy yourself.

01:35.246 --> 01:35.897
Thank you.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.146
And always put grace first.
