Assuming the fanboys are all over sequels to World War Z,...

00:06.723 --> 00:08.338
...I mean, is there one planned?

00:09.177 --> 00:10.622
We're certainly talking about it, yes.

00:11.825 --> 00:16.379
We have so many ideas on the table from the time we spent just developing this thing...

00:16.439 --> 00:18.161
...and figuring out how the zombie worlds work.

00:18.779 --> 00:21.269
We have so many ideas and so much information...

00:21.355 --> 00:26.169
...that we think we got a lot of stuff to mine from or two.

00:26.610 --> 00:29.837
So we're gonna do our best and see what we get out of it.

00:29.961 --> 00:32.558
We've got to get the script right first to determine if we go further.
