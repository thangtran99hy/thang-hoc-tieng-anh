ï»¿There are five keys to building rock-solid partnerships.

00:13.059 --> 00:14.671
The first is how you get in the door.

00:14.735 --> 00:16.722
Make sure you get a warm intro.

00:16.809 --> 00:20.289
Use your network and get somebody to link you into that person.

00:20.375 --> 00:23.150
It builds a nice common ground to start the partnership.

00:23.555 --> 00:25.273
The second is know their business.

00:25.399 --> 00:28.747
You want to know the business or the partner that you're going into...

00:28.853 --> 00:31.174
...almost as much as you know your own business...

00:31.529 --> 00:34.298
...and that segues in to understand their needs.

00:34.533 --> 00:36.694
You really want to understand what their needs are...

00:36.771 --> 00:38.637
...just as much as you understand your needs...

00:38.924 --> 00:42.425
...so that you can negotiate the best possible deal.

00:42.727 --> 00:44.983
The fourth is really solving their pain-point.

00:45.095 --> 00:50.341
Once you understand their needs, you can really better quantify, clarify,...

00:50.399 --> 00:53.355
...and communicate how you can solve their pain-point.

00:53.617 --> 00:58.333
And the last is you're cultivating a long-term relationship when you're building a partnership,...

00:58.665 --> 01:01.493
...so this is not a deal that you close and that you move on.

01:01.849 --> 01:04.657
You need to cultivate this relationship for the long term,...

01:04.721 --> 01:08.016
...which includes the small things like holiday cards,...

01:08.256 --> 01:13.360
...but also keeping up with where that company is and sending notes on important events...

01:13.445 --> 01:16.569
...like financing or other partnerships that they've entered into.

01:17.056 --> 01:19.255
If you stick with these five core tips,...

01:19.507 --> 01:22.676
...you will be on your way to building great rock-solid partnerships.
