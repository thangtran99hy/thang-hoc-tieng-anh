00:01.949 --> 00:02.534
Can I help you?

00:03.404 --> 00:04.066
Excuse me, hi.

00:04.660 --> 00:07.719
I wanted to find out about the unlimited for life guarantee.

00:07.799 --> 00:11.135
Sure, Sprint is guaranteeing unlimited talk, text and data for life.

00:11.216 --> 00:11.935
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

00:12.159 --> 00:15.019
And what if, say, technically, you were not alive?

00:15.139 --> 00:17.223
Like maybe you were undead?

00:17.365 --> 00:18.149
Like a zombie.

00:18.251 --> 00:18.933
Whoa.

00:19.027 --> 00:20.822
Let's not go putting labels on people.

00:23.714 --> 00:24.351
I'm a zombie.

00:24.998 --> 00:26.110
Unlimited from Sprint.

00:26.187 --> 00:27.400
It's guaranteed for life.

00:27.565 --> 00:29.397
Now for only 80 dollars a month.
