World's Weirdest Restaurants takes you to a roadhouse in Florida...

00:07.487 --> 00:09.767
...where you can eat exotic game or feed it.

00:10.329 --> 00:13.657
I've seen some wild menus before, but not quite as literal as this.

00:15.892 --> 00:19.387
We'll travel to a cafe in Japan where maids are the masters.

00:20.555 --> 00:21.675
My god!

00:22.455 --> 00:23.343
I'm in love.

00:23.427 --> 00:26.349
Then, we'll head to Vancouver for culinary matchmaking.

00:26.437 --> 00:28.621
If you can mix food with romance, why not.

00:28.701 --> 00:30.974
There's no question that the dating game, you got it.

00:32.978 --> 00:37.209
And finally, we'll travel to the American Midwest with the clear alibi.

00:37.295 --> 00:38.195
It feels like a maze.

00:38.275 --> 00:41.187
Every time you turn a corner, you expect to run into Dr. No.
