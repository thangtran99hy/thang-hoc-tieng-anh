00:04.920 --> 00:06.335
So you don't want to go play Ping-Pong?

00:07.746 --> 00:08.209
It's fine.

00:09.158 --> 00:11.849
Let's talk about what kind of restaurant you should be picking.

00:12.167 --> 00:15.911
So, obviously you have to pick something that you can actually have a conversation in.

00:16.061 --> 00:21.138
So, if you're gonna go to a restaurant, find something kind of middle-of-the-road, you know.

00:21.516 --> 00:23.303
You wanna make sure your date feels comfortable,...

00:23.385 --> 00:26.633
...but at the same time, you probably shouldn't be taking her to McDonald's for the first date.

00:27.365 --> 00:31.475
So, somewhere in the middle, there lies a nice little Italian,...

00:31.585 --> 00:36.680
...or whatever place that you can actually have a conversation and connect at.

00:36.769 --> 00:37.969
I think that's the biggest thing.

00:38.153 --> 00:43.847
It needs to feel romantic, and it needs to feel like you can have an intimate conversation.

00:43.914 --> 00:45.925
Don't go anywhere too fancy.

00:46.041 --> 00:48.934
You're not putting on your tuxedo on the first date.

00:49.023 --> 00:52.266
You're not gonna make your date feel uncomfortable if she shows up in jeans and heels.

00:52.782 --> 00:55.890
So, you need to find something that's kind of middle-of-the-road,...

00:56.016 --> 00:57.786
...a bunch of different outfits would work for it.

00:57.865 --> 00:59.872
Not that you are guys are thinking of this, but we are.

01:00.714 --> 01:06.027
Anything above a chain restaurant and below, like the Four Seasons is pretty much doable for a first date.

01:06.125 --> 01:07.855
You need to have a conversation.

01:07.967 --> 01:09.652
You need to be able to hear each other.

01:09.749 --> 01:13.133
So yeah, a little Italian restaurant where you can bring your own bottle of wine...

01:13.238 --> 01:18.235
...and maybe having a little story about how you picked it out, just to give something to talk about...

01:18.310 --> 01:23.893
...or something that kind of lends itself to a good environment.

01:24.015 --> 01:28.961
You want it to feel intimate and romantic but not too over-the-top.
