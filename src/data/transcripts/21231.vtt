Some of the things we're gonna need when we're gonna clean the cut are some sterile water...

00:05.237 --> 00:06.589
...and some gauze bandages.

00:07.755 --> 00:11.868
The first step when we're going to clean a cut is to make sure that the bleeding has stopped.

00:12.451 --> 00:15.820
Once the bleeding has stopped, what we're gonna do is we're gonna take some sterile water.

00:16.857 --> 00:19.950
And with this sterile water, we're gonna take it and we're gonna flush the wound out.

00:20.931 --> 00:23.751
We can either do that by pouring the water over the cut...

00:24.085 --> 00:28.461
...or we can take a gauze bandage and soak the gauze bandage with water.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.861
Once we do that, we'll clean the wound out good,...

00:33.373 --> 00:37.167
...make sure that there's no debris or dirt or anything like that inside the cut.

00:38.413 --> 00:42.006
After we finish getting that out, making sure that there's no dirt left in the cut...

00:42.504 --> 00:46.729
...we'll take a new clean gauze dressing, and we'll make sure that the cut is dry.

00:47.966 --> 00:51.097
Before we bandage the cut, we don't want to have any water left on there...

00:51.182 --> 00:52.937
...because water can breed germs.

00:53.529 --> 00:56.287
So, we wanna make sure that the dirt is all cleaned out the cut...

00:56.361 --> 00:58.711
...and that everything is dry before we start bandaging.
