00:00.182 --> 00:04.875
CPR is a combination of rescue breathing and chest impressions.

00:05.211 --> 00:10.212
It involves the compression of the heart between the breastbone and the backbone...

00:10.641 --> 00:15.503
...and supplying oxygen to the lungs by blowing into the casualty's mouth.

00:16.043 --> 00:22.356
Position yourself in a way that will allow you to apply vertical pressure during compressions.

00:22.677 --> 00:29.115
Visualize the center of the casualty's chest and place the palm of one hand on that point.

00:29.630 --> 00:33.851
Place the other palm on top of the first and interlock the fingers.

00:34.323 --> 00:38.561
Alternatively, you can also grasp around the wrist of the first hand.

00:38.961 --> 00:40.733
Either method is acceptable.

00:41.217 --> 00:47.287
Deliver 30 chest compressions at the rate of not less than 100 compressions per minute.

00:47.816 --> 00:52.733
Each compression should depress the chest 1.5 to 2 inches.

00:53.257 --> 00:59.151
After each compression, release the pressure completely, allowing the chest to recoil.

00:59.611 --> 01:03.937
After the 30 compressions, open the airway by lifting the chin...

01:04.259 --> 01:07.192
...and tilting the casualty's head backwards.

01:07.690 --> 01:12.835
Pinch the nostrils to close the nose and open the mouth with the help of the chin...

01:13.355 --> 01:15.225
...to give two rescue breaths.

01:15.654 --> 01:19.129
The two breaths should not take more than five seconds.

01:19.859 --> 01:26.177
Continue CPR until the casualty wakes up, or advanced medical aid arrives.
