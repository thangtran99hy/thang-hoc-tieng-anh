Welcome to English in a Minute,...

00:06.613 --> 00:11.098
...where we teach you all about idioms in American English.

00:11.817 --> 00:16.453
If you have ever heard American English, you might have heard this.

00:16.871 --> 00:17.571
Hit the sack.

00:18.320 --> 00:19.269
What does this mean?

00:19.907 --> 00:22.887
Let's find out by listening to this conversation.

00:24.696 --> 00:27.251
I'm exhausted and can't stay up another minute.

00:27.956 --> 00:28.894
I'm gonna go hit the sack.

00:29.517 --> 00:31.944
I probably should do the same, it's been a long day.

00:32.329 --> 00:35.355
It sounds like they are tired and ready to sleep.

00:35.903 --> 00:39.669
That's what "hit the sack" means; you are going to bed.

00:40.483 --> 00:45.991
During World War II, American soldiers called their sleeping bags "sacks".

00:46.345 --> 00:49.494
So, "hit the sack" meant "to go to bed".

00:50.021 --> 00:53.073
Today, people use this phrase all the time.

00:53.519 --> 00:54.366
Hit the sack.

00:55.455 --> 00:57.660
And that's English in a Minute.
