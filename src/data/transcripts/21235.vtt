Welcome to English in a Minute, where we teach you all about idioms in American English.

00:10.084 --> 00:16.017
Like most people, Americans want to look good,...

00:16.204 --> 00:19.869
...and many people exercise every day.

00:20.745 --> 00:22.644
Have you ever heard this phrase?

00:23.035 --> 00:24.382
No pain, no gain.

00:24.861 --> 00:26.079
Hey, you look great.

00:26.179 --> 00:27.443
Have you been exercising?

00:27.588 --> 00:29.900
Yeah, every day for the last three months.

00:29.988 --> 00:32.706
Well, it must be so hard to exercise for so long.

00:33.165 --> 00:35.231
Yeah, but I want to look good.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.516
And you know, no pain, no gain.

00:37.735 --> 00:41.700
In American English, "to gain" something means "to get something".

00:41.927 --> 00:46.660
And often, it takes hard work, especially when you are exercising.

00:46.767 --> 00:52.104
So, in our example, although it might be hard to exercise so much,...

00:52.233 --> 00:55.279
...in the end, she gained the look she wanted.

00:55.574 --> 00:57.784
No pain, no gain.

00:58.040 --> 01:00.019
And that's English in a Minute.
