Welcome to English in a Minute, where we teach you all about idioms in American English.

00:10.271 --> 00:14.463
Let's pretend you are in a major US city.

00:15.205 --> 00:20.429
You are listening to an American English conversation and you hear this.

00:21.100 --> 00:21.679
Hey, Bob.

00:21.833 --> 00:24.696
Ever since you opened your coffee shop, you have been very busy.

00:24.791 --> 00:26.970
Is the business going well and making money?

00:27.137 --> 00:28.390
Yeah! I can't believe it.

00:28.476 --> 00:29.761
It's going really well.

00:29.854 --> 00:32.838
In fact, my coffee shop has become a real cash cow for me.

00:33.360 --> 00:36.159
How does a cow produce cash?

00:36.361 --> 00:38.695
Everyone knows cows make milk.

00:38.996 --> 00:43.865
But in American English, a "cash cow" is a product or service...

00:43.969 --> 00:46.878
...that makes a lot of money for a business.

00:47.187 --> 00:52.529
This common phrase is used in casual and business conversations.

00:52.770 --> 00:57.311
And when you use it, everyone will understand what you are saying.

00:57.531 --> 00:59.276
And that's English in a Minute.
