Welcome to English in a Minute, where we teach you about idioms in American English.

00:09.891 --> 00:13.284
Our language is full of fun expressions.

00:13.684 --> 00:21.913
And here at the Voice of America, we offer you high-quality English lessons twenty-four seven.

00:22.999 --> 00:24.137
But what does this mean?

00:24.358 --> 00:26.340
I'm learning English at the university.

00:26.703 --> 00:28.158
Where are you learning English?

00:28.279 --> 00:30.314
I'm learning English with Voice of America.

00:30.792 --> 00:34.117
Their Learning English website is available twenty-four seven.

00:34.507 --> 00:36.500
Twenty-four seven? Wow!

00:36.799 --> 00:39.690
Maybe I should learn English at VOA, too.

00:39.963 --> 00:44.669
There are 24 hours in a day, and seven days in a week.

00:45.146 --> 00:53.201
When you say twenty-four seven in a conversation, it refers to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

00:53.691 --> 00:58.590
It is another way of saying all day and all night, every day of the week.

00:58.781 --> 01:00.589
And that's English in a Minute.
