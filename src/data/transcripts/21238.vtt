Welcome to "English in a Minute," where we teach you about idioms in American English.

00:11.640 --> 00:16.011
If you have heard American English, you have probably heard this:...

00:16.785 --> 00:17.783
..."It's a dime a dozen."

00:19.151 --> 00:20.571
What does this phrase mean?

00:21.321 --> 00:22.547
Let's find out.

00:24.525 --> 00:28.515
There's no need for you to pay 20 dollars for that hairbrush, it's too expensive.

00:28.598 --> 00:29.114
Why not?

00:29.181 --> 00:30.194
I really need it.

00:30.942 --> 00:33.248
The store down the street has them at a dime a dozen.

00:33.353 --> 00:34.333
Come on, I'll show you.

00:36.485 --> 00:39.531
When you say something is "a dime a dozen,"...

00:40.006 --> 00:46.829
...it means that there's a lot of it, it doesn't cost much or that it isn't special.

00:47.904 --> 00:48.818
"It's a dime a dozen."

00:49.773 --> 00:56.028
This is a common way of saying that something is so easy to get that it doesn't have much value.

00:56.655 --> 00:58.463
And that's "English in a Minute."
