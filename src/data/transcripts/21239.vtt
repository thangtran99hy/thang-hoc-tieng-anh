Welcome to "English in a Minute."

00:07.045 --> 00:11.653
If you have ever heard American English, you have probably heard this before:...

00:12.488 --> 00:14.201
"I'm a jack of all trades."

00:15.108 --> 00:19.244
This expression can tell you a lot about a person in American English.

00:19.585 --> 00:22.084
It means a person can do anything.

00:22.731 --> 00:23.746
So what do you do for a living?

00:24.188 --> 00:25.083
I'm a handywoman.

00:25.287 --> 00:29.572
I fix and replace just about anything, from computers to shower drains.

00:29.928 --> 00:32.283
I guess you could say I'm a jack of all trades.

00:32.865 --> 00:37.181
Basically, when you say "jack of all trades" in a conversation,...

00:37.417 --> 00:41.005
...it's another way to say that someone has many professional talents.

00:41.711 --> 00:46.677
You may also hear this phrase used: "Jack of all trades, master of none."

00:47.263 --> 00:52.295
It was used to describe people who learned how to do a lot of different things.

00:52.518 --> 00:56.275
But they weren't able to focus on doing one thing correctly.

00:57.111 --> 00:59.094
And that's "English in a Minute."
