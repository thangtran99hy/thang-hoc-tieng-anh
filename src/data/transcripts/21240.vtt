ï»¿Welcome to English in a Minute.

00:07.493 --> 00:12.047
Where we teach you all about idioms in American English.

00:12.827 --> 00:16.568
If people tell you that you need to make up your mind,...

00:16.911 --> 00:18.011
...what do you think they mean?

00:18.663 --> 00:19.712
Let's listen.

00:20.737 --> 00:23.370
I'd like to go to France to see the Eiffel Tower...

00:24.067 --> 00:26.033
...or Italy for the awesome food.

00:26.712 --> 00:29.299
Or maybe Spain for the amazing beaches.

00:29.391 --> 00:31.345
OK, OK, make up your mind!

00:31.977 --> 00:33.019
Make up your mind!

00:34.483 --> 00:39.627
"Make up your mind" is a way of saying make a decision or pick something.

00:40.299 --> 00:44.804
It might mean making a choice from two or more things.

00:45.377 --> 00:47.985
Some people have trouble making a decision...

00:48.217 --> 00:52.534
...so others might tell them, "Make up your mind and pick one."

00:53.589 --> 00:54.735
Make up your mind!

00:56.487 --> 00:58.399
And that's English in a Minute.
