00:12.109 --> 00:18.055
Let's say you have worked all day, and you are really tired, like these people:...

00:21.088 --> 00:22.291
I am exhausted.

00:22.402 --> 00:24.807
I have been working at this since 7:00 AM this morning.

00:25.459 --> 00:26.105
Me, too.

00:26.467 --> 00:28.019
I think it's time we call it a day.

00:28.183 --> 00:28.594
I agree.

00:28.760 --> 00:29.376
Let's go home.

00:29.973 --> 00:30.923
Call it a day!

00:33.527 --> 00:36.832
When you "call it a day" in American English,...

00:37.053 --> 00:42.587
...it means you are ending work, play or something you are doing that day.

00:43.691 --> 00:47.965
Often, it means you have finished your work and you are going home.

00:48.660 --> 00:53.613
You can use this phrase in any situation, and everybody in America will understand you.

00:54.164 --> 00:55.947
And that's English in a Minute.

00:56.276 --> 00:58.905
So, I'm calling it a day and going home.
