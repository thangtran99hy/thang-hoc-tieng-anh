Welcome to English in a Minute.

00:06.328 --> 00:11.949
If you have ever heard American English, you probably have heard this saying.

00:12.566 --> 00:15.079
Hey man, just go with the flow.

00:15.222 --> 00:19.312
This is a fun expression that can be used in many ways.

00:20.064 --> 00:24.221
Let's listen to this idiom in an actual conversation.

00:25.213 --> 00:28.575
Should we stop and grab something to eat before we get to the movie theater...

00:28.643 --> 00:30.715
...or do you just want to grab something at the movies?

00:30.824 --> 00:31.420
What do you think?

00:31.940 --> 00:32.975
I like to go with the flow.

00:33.037 --> 00:34.339
Whatever you decide is cool with me.

00:35.303 --> 00:38.241
This phrase makes you think of watching water.

00:38.997 --> 00:43.617
When you "go with the flow", you swim in the direction that the water's moving.

00:43.897 --> 00:44.841
It's easy.

00:45.221 --> 00:51.895
In the same way, a person who "goes with the flow" easily fits in to a given situation.

00:52.368 --> 00:54.049
Plus, it rhymes.

00:54.453 --> 00:54.977
Go.

00:55.246 --> 00:55.725
Flow.

00:56.375 --> 00:57.158
Sounds nice.

00:57.635 --> 00:59.329
And that's English in a Minute.
