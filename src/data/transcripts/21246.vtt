Welcome to English in a Minute, where we teach you about idioms in American English.

00:13.069 --> 00:18.167
Making decisions is important, and it can be difficult.

00:18.979 --> 00:24.015
When you ask people to decide something, you might hear them say:...

00:25.417 --> 00:26.384
...It's up to you!

00:27.491 --> 00:32.159
To find out what this one means, let's listen to this conversation.

00:33.370 --> 00:34.583
What do you want for dinner tonight?

00:34.732 --> 00:35.359
I'm not sure.

00:35.446 --> 00:36.041
What do you want?

00:36.304 --> 00:37.117
It's up to you.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.619
Whatever you want, we will have.

00:40.175 --> 00:44.558
When you say, "It's up to you," it's another way to say...

00:44.720 --> 00:47.557
...that you want the other person to choose.

00:48.024 --> 00:50.851
That might be because you can't decide,...

00:51.241 --> 00:54.799
...or you are being nice and are letting someone else choose.

00:55.665 --> 00:56.504
It's up to you!

00:57.879 --> 01:00.021
And that's English in a Minute.
