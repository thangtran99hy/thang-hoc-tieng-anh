ï»¿To start this bubbling bowl of beauty,...

00:03.401 --> 00:07.623
...we're gonna go ahead and remove the kale leaves from the thick stems.

00:10.087 --> 00:13.306
Then we're gonna take our green onions and we're gonna cut the bottoms off.

00:14.741 --> 00:16.198
We're gonna slice up the bottom part.

00:17.933 --> 00:19.488
Then we're gonna slice up the top part.

00:21.568 --> 00:23.162
Chop up half a white onion.

00:25.123 --> 00:26.669
Chop up a couple cloves of garlic.

00:28.961 --> 00:36.692
We got our garbanzo beans, also known as chickpeas, and our black beans here.

00:36.767 --> 00:38.431
I'm draining them and rinsing them...

00:39.026 --> 00:42.272
...because I don't want the black bean juice to overpower the rest of the soup.

00:44.179 --> 00:46.626
Into a pan goes the onions with some olive oil.

00:49.741 --> 00:56.123
Once they cook down, follow with some garlic and our spices, paprika and Italian seasoning.

01:00.508 --> 01:02.081
Then we add the bottoms of our green onions.

01:05.795 --> 01:11.829
Salt and some pepper to taste.

01:13.866 --> 01:14.890
Three cups of water.

01:20.177 --> 01:21.935
Our can of garbanzo beans.

01:23.761 --> 01:27.137
Our can of drained and rinsed black beans.

01:29.402 --> 01:31.431
Give it a mix and we're gonna bring this to a boil.

01:32.806 --> 01:38.499
Now that we've brought our soup to a boil, we're just gonna let it simmer for about 45 minutes.

01:40.183 --> 01:43.633
We want our beans to get nice and soft and then we'll add our kale.

01:46.473 --> 01:47.663
Okay, we're done simmering.

01:47.761 --> 01:49.240
Let's go ahead and throw our kale in.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.072
Simmer for ten more minutes.

01:55.494 --> 01:56.350
Here's what you get.

01:59.495 --> 02:09.711
We're gonna garnish this with the tops of our green onions, some croutons and Parmesan cheese.
