00:09.979 --> 00:14.203
Four common mistakes that I see, sort of on the other side of the table...

00:14.603 --> 00:18.509
...for folks that are wanting to do a business development deal or in negotiations.

00:18.929 --> 00:21.158
The first one is really being too aggressive.

00:21.607 --> 00:26.762
There is definitely a difference between persistence and pestering in business development.

00:27.118 --> 00:28.087
It's a fine line.

00:28.212 --> 00:32.112
You can really turn somebody off if you're aggressively pursuing them.

00:32.295 --> 00:34.733
The second one is talking more than listening.

00:34.908 --> 00:37.100
This is also just very true in sales.

00:37.441 --> 00:42.737
You really want to listen to the partner that you're potentially working with...

00:42.831 --> 00:45.346
...and really understand what is their pain point...

00:45.449 --> 00:47.276
...and what are they looking to get out of the deal.

00:47.667 --> 00:50.741
The third angle is really structuring a bias deal.

00:51.127 --> 00:52.280
You do not want to do that.

00:52.395 --> 00:54.656
Every deal, honestly, should be a win-win.

00:54.990 --> 00:57.297
I hate using that statement, it's a little overused...

00:57.398 --> 00:59.883
...but when you're doing a business development deal,...

01:00.280 --> 01:03.345
...both sides of the table need to walk away extremely happy.

01:03.510 --> 01:06.101
The fourth is premature discussion of terms.

01:06.465 --> 01:11.848
Oftentimes we haven't even gone through the listening and talking and how is this gonna work...

01:12.291 --> 01:14.905
...and somebody will send me an e-mail with a term sheet.

01:15.279 --> 01:19.173
Again, that is very aggressive and often that term sheet's a bias deal.

01:19.518 --> 01:20.937
You really want to avoid that.

01:21.168 --> 01:24.629
If you avoid those four common mistakes of business negotiations,...

01:24.693 --> 01:27.061
...you'll be well on your way to making great partnerships.
