Self-defense is the best defense, but accidents do happen.

00:06.077 --> 00:09.068
Which is why the smart thing to do is always be prepared.

00:09.927 --> 00:13.779
And that is why I carry with me the first aid box.

00:14.659 --> 00:15.214
Always.

00:17.725 --> 00:19.827
So what's in my first aid box?

00:20.724 --> 00:21.555
I'll show you.

00:25.441 --> 00:27.912
Adhesive bandages in different sizes.

00:29.799 --> 00:32.191
Gauze and gauze pads.

00:32.863 --> 00:34.347
Latex gloves.

00:36.017 --> 00:38.548
To protect you from those bodily fluids.

00:41.152 --> 00:42.258
Tweezers.

00:44.958 --> 00:45.741
Thermometer.

00:47.606 --> 00:50.598
Antibiotic cream such as Neosporin.

00:51.669 --> 00:53.935
Antihistamines and pain relievers.

00:56.396 --> 00:57.536
Crepe bandages.

00:59.435 --> 01:00.279
And the clips.

01:02.723 --> 01:04.253
Antiseptic liquid.

01:08.108 --> 01:08.955
Safety pins.

01:11.007 --> 01:11.605
Burn cream.

01:13.474 --> 01:14.082
Scissors.

01:15.724 --> 01:17.945
So that's what's in my first aid kit.

01:26.613 --> 01:31.011
Just ensure that all your medicines are well within the expiry date.
