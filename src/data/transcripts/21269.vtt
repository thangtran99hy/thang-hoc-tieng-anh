Hey Jammers! Dr. Brady here.

00:08.467 --> 00:10.243
I got a question from General Brave Claw.

00:10.423 --> 00:15.010
And they ask, "Have you ever heard of the chupacabra? And what is it?"

00:15.668 --> 00:16.859
It's an interesting question.

00:17.244 --> 00:19.055
I have heard of the chupacabra.

00:19.635 --> 00:23.058
The chupacabra is like a mythical beast...

00:24.057 --> 00:30.648
...like say Bigfoot, or the Abominable Snowman, or the Loch Ness Monster.

00:32.393 --> 00:35.360
It's supposedly found in Latin America...

00:35.816 --> 00:41.003
...and it's this creature which supposedly kills goats and other animals...

00:41.080 --> 00:42.920
...and sucks their blood.

00:43.569 --> 00:47.153
You know, a lot of people claimed to have seen it or seen its footprints...

00:47.209 --> 00:51.889
...or maybe found some fur, kind of like Bigfoot or the Abominable Snowman...

00:51.959 --> 00:53.683
...but there's no scientific proof.

00:54.978 --> 00:58.500
In my opinion, it's just a mythical beast, the chupacabra.
