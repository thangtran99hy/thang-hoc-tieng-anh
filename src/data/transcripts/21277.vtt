00:00.516 --> 00:00.837
Ready?

00:02.221 --> 00:03.620
If you can find your toes,...

00:05.299 --> 00:07.116
...you can find your head with your toes.

00:07.730 --> 00:09.396
Here? With those guys?

00:10.683 --> 00:11.806
You know what, say hi to Jessie.

00:12.551 --> 00:13.644
Find your rhythm.

00:15.871 --> 00:16.965
Now, find the spotlight.

00:17.936 --> 00:18.590
Deep breath.

00:21.749 --> 00:22.635
Yep, nailed it.

00:24.141 --> 00:26.029
If you can run late, run the block.

00:26.542 --> 00:27.739
Oh, it's too easy?

00:27.999 --> 00:28.824
Well, outrun them.

00:29.925 --> 00:30.707
Outrun him.

00:31.368 --> 00:32.377
Adios, Pique.

00:32.895 --> 00:33.807
Now, run a race.

00:34.274 --> 00:36.905
Not that kind, a real race.

00:38.255 --> 00:39.606
Now, that's how you run.

00:42.823 --> 00:46.017
If you can swim a lap, swim deeper.

00:47.054 --> 00:47.700
Not bad.

00:50.552 --> 00:51.467
Don't let up now.

00:54.623 --> 00:55.987
You might wanna get moving.
