00:07.567 --> 00:10.815
So what would be your perfect weapon of choice for the zombie apocalypse?

00:10.894 --> 00:11.609
Grenade launcher.

00:11.684 --> 00:13.365
Double cannon with a chain attached to it.

00:13.443 --> 00:16.919
Acid sprayer so that you can like melt their brains.

00:17.004 --> 00:18.579
A sentry gun on top.

00:18.668 --> 00:21.354
And I'd get up and just start shooting all the zombies.

00:21.477 --> 00:24.304
A rotor from a helicopter, do some decapitation.

00:29.938 --> 00:31.311
Both have their ups and downs.

00:31.384 --> 00:33.893
I like the idea of the flamethrower just for distance.

00:33.959 --> 00:34.771
The cattle gun's cooler.

00:34.970 --> 00:36.331
I would go with the flamethrower.

00:39.689 --> 00:42.317
Can you put the cattle gun and the flamethrower on the car?

00:42.387 --> 00:43.412
I didn't say you can have all of them.

00:43.539 --> 00:46.593
You get the flames on them, their bodies melting.

00:46.779 --> 00:48.023
I'd probably go with the cattle gun.

00:51.057 --> 00:52.793
I probably would use my signals.

00:52.882 --> 00:54.031
I'd be the last one.

00:54.427 --> 00:56.449
That would probably just tell the zombies where you were going.

00:57.051 --> 00:57.784
Politeness.

00:57.916 --> 01:00.037
I can't even drive as a human being.

01:00.269 --> 01:03.193
But I mean, we're talking about zombie apocalypse.

01:03.335 --> 01:06.737
If you were to stop and, you know, put your window down,...

01:06.990 --> 01:09.349
...the cop that's gonna come over and pull you, he's probably gonna be a zombie.

01:10.723 --> 01:12.629
Yeah, that's not a smart move.

01:15.749 --> 01:16.523
10,000.

01:16.785 --> 01:17.473
50

01:17.563 --> 01:19.636
If we're going, I might be able to do 30, 40 an hour.

01:19.767 --> 01:22.144
Realistically speaking, I would go with seven.

01:22.379 --> 01:24.384
I would just run over zombies all freaking day.

01:24.497 --> 01:25.735
You're not worried about ammo?

01:28.829 --> 01:33.801
Design and build your Hyundai zombie survival machine now at walkingdeadchopshop.com.

01:34.081 --> 01:36.727
And who would be in charge of cleaning off the horde plow?

01:36.842 --> 01:37.152
He would.

01:37.272 --> 01:38.056
Oh, okay.
