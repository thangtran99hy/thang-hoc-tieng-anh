Hi, I'm Merrin from The Small Business Geeks and I'm gonna show you some technical tips...

00:04.620 --> 00:06.334
...and how to present yourself on video.

00:08.589 --> 00:09.973
Technical Tip: Audio.

00:11.090 --> 00:14.773
If you're wearing a microphone, make sure that you don't play around with it...

00:15.007 --> 00:19.456
...and be real mindful of things like jewelry that will be very distracting if, for some reason,...

00:20.271 --> 00:21.417
...they knock against the microphone.

00:23.548 --> 00:27.899
Presentation Tip: Use language that everyone can understand.

00:28.286 --> 00:34.137
Simple words, nothing too long, nothing too big unless that's your specific target audience.

00:34.644 --> 00:39.167
For example, a doctor might need to use technical terms but otherwise keep it simple,...

00:39.520 --> 00:40.440
...don't use too much slang.

00:41.397 --> 00:43.261
Well, hopefully you find those tips helpful.
