I'm not going to lie. Anytime you hear the term "economy rice,"...

00:06.695 --> 00:09.620
...it doesn't exactly make the food sound overly appealing.

00:10.267 --> 00:12.281
That is, if you're not in Malaysia.

00:13.635 --> 00:17.351
Economy rice is the Chinese style of Malay nasi campur,...

00:17.865 --> 00:20.952
...a plate of rice topped with a variety of different dishes.

00:21.763 --> 00:27.223
During the lunch time rush in Kuala Lumpur, many economy rice stalls set up along the streets,...

00:27.466 --> 00:29.995
...serving home-cooked Chinese Malaysian food.

00:30.425 --> 00:35.528

00:36.111 --> 00:39.152
Got a plate of rice and a few different mixed dishes.

00:40.055 --> 00:41.703
Braised tofu I think this is.

00:42.823 --> 00:44.054
Let me taste that.

00:48.808 --> 00:49.683
Yeah, that's good.
