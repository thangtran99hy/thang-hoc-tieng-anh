00:13.871 --> 00:16.353
Today's global snack comes from Cape Town.

00:17.394 --> 00:22.561
With three and a half million residents, it's South Africa's second largest city after Johannesburg.

00:25.261 --> 00:29.154
Edwin and Mervin Collins run a snack bar right in the center of town.

00:30.956 --> 00:35.782
I'm grilling lamb and lovely jumbo boerewors rolls freshly flame-grilled today.

00:44.204 --> 00:47.417
There's chicken or pork on offer, but the traditional item here...

00:47.823 --> 00:52.741
...is a uniquely South African grilled sausage invented by the first European settlers.

00:53.462 --> 00:54.891
It's called boerewors.

00:57.631 --> 01:02.112
It has a distinct taste, like it's from the farm...

01:02.136 --> 01:04.164
...because that's what it is, farm sausage boerewors.

01:04.461 --> 01:05.557
"Boer" are farmers.

01:09.161 --> 01:14.449
The sausage consists of 30 percent pork, twice as much beef and lots of fat,...

01:14.871 --> 01:19.086
...but the distinct taste comes from the spices used to flavor the meat and the sauces.

01:21.897 --> 01:23.682
We put five different spices.

01:23.922 --> 01:27.334
Spices that you don't normally associate with boerewors...

01:27.552 --> 01:34.523
...like coriander, cumin, vinegar, obviously salt, pepper and African dahlia too.
