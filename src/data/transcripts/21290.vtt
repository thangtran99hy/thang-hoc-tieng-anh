We live in a wonderful world, full of life, full of color, full of beauty.

00:10.639 --> 00:18.263
But in recent years, our world has been devastated by hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and droughts.

00:19.149 --> 00:24.145
What does the future hold for planet earth, the place we all call home?

00:25.269 --> 00:27.731

00:28.299 --> 00:35.072
Scientists predict that within 50 years, many parts of our world could be under 20 centimeters of water.

00:35.493 --> 00:38.461
We can prevent this if we all work together.

00:39.236 --> 00:41.328
There is still time for us to save our world!

00:42.020 --> 00:47.931
Solar panels, wind farms and underwater turbines are being used to produce renewable energy.

00:49.053 --> 00:51.696
These are sources that can be used again and again.

00:52.354 --> 00:55.873
Although there are still many more things that we can be doing.

00:56.465 --> 00:59.184
Things that you and your family can do together.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.532
You can reduce the amount of waste you produce.

01:04.135 --> 01:08.196
This can be done by being more resourceful with the things that you use and buy.

01:09.967 --> 01:13.171
You and your family can recycle many items in your home.

01:14.403 --> 01:16.205
Just look at what you can reuse.
