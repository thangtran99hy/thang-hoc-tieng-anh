00:02.855 --> 00:04.381
Freddy Footprint's garden.

00:07.757 --> 00:09.167
Freddy works with his feet.

00:09.865 --> 00:10.829
Feet are clumsy.

00:11.348 --> 00:12.537
The flowers are trodden.

00:12.842 --> 00:15.894
The trees are bare and the branches broken.

00:20.399 --> 00:23.337
The air is dirty and the pond is full of rubbish.

00:28.257 --> 00:29.543
Harry Handprint's garden.

00:29.927 --> 00:32.392
Seeds had been sown, trees planted,...

00:32.809 --> 00:34.575
...oxygen pumped into the water.

00:35.659 --> 00:38.291
We know about reducing our negative carbon footprint.

00:38.791 --> 00:41.783
Do you know the power you hold in your positive handprint?

00:42.036 --> 00:44.019
Sow some seeds, plant a tree.

00:44.321 --> 00:45.932
Turn a patio into a flower bed.

00:46.235 --> 00:50.609
Better still, get involved in an eco-restoration project or start your own.

00:51.061 --> 00:53.896
Give the Earth a chance and watch her grow.

00:55.285 --> 00:57.712
Freddy Footprint or Harry Handprint?

00:57.905 --> 00:58.772
Who are you?

01:00.128 --> 01:01.835
Hands up for restoring the Earth.

01:02.924 --> 01:08.491
Text the word "Earth" to 83023 to put your hand up for restoring the Earth.
