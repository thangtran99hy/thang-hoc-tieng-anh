Justin Timberlake: this guy, he really broke out as a solo artist.

00:11.160 --> 00:14.504
Do you ever sit back and think, "You know, anyone of us could have done that."...

00:14.614 --> 00:16.990
...or is it that he was just a special guy...

00:17.087 --> 00:19.831
...that he was able to go so far as a solo artist.

00:21.683 --> 00:24.133
I think that was his honest-to-God destiny.

00:24.327 --> 00:31.034
I really do, I think being part of a group was a great stepping stone for him...

00:31.133 --> 00:35.893
...but I think somewhere in the cards, he was destined to be on his own...

00:36.011 --> 00:38.911
...and to have as much success that he has...

00:38.996 --> 00:41.522
...because he honestly deserves it, he's an amazing artist.

00:43.102 --> 00:49.395
I think with us, if any of us would have had equal or comparable success just like him,...

00:50.212 --> 00:52.197
...I still think we'd still be doing this as well.

00:52.567 --> 00:52.777
Right.

00:52.861 --> 00:54.957
I think that's just the kind of bond that we have.

00:55.691 --> 00:56.852
Everybody gets along.

00:57.077 --> 00:59.895
Yeah, I mean we've all gone out there and kind of got our feet wet.

01:00.002 --> 01:03.497
I mean, obviously none of us have had that type of solo success...

01:03.851 --> 01:06.962
...but we have had success as solo artists here and there.

01:07.698 --> 01:10.067
And yet, this is what's most important to us.

01:10.149 --> 01:13.371
I always say Backstreet Boys are larger than the sum of their parts.

01:13.747 --> 01:14.009
Yeah.

01:14.088 --> 01:18.934
Because all five of us together are obviously larger than one individual.

01:19.995 --> 01:20.517
Larger than life.
