Hey, this is Robert Lamb from Stuff to Blow Your Mind,...

00:02.406 --> 00:04.396
...and I'm here to talk to you about space suits.

00:04.660 --> 00:08.377
Now everybody wants to go on a spacewalk, but you cannot do it naked.

00:08.446 --> 00:09.851
I can't stress that enough.

00:10.068 --> 00:11.799
You're gonna need to invest in a good space suit,...

00:12.014 --> 00:14.957
...and you're gonna want that space suit to do three things for you.

00:15.291 --> 00:17.005
First, the suit has to provide oxygen,...

00:17.077 --> 00:18.832
...all right, you're gonna have to be able to breathe in that thing.

00:19.301 --> 00:22.825
All right, and then it's gonna have to provide pressurized air all around your body.

00:22.909 --> 00:24.326
The problem in some of the earlier suits...

00:24.725 --> 00:26.563
...is that it created something called the balloon effect.

00:26.721 --> 00:30.547
Modern suits control the balloon effect by using low pressure inside the suit...

00:30.796 --> 00:32.831
...and a hard fiberglass torso section.

00:33.261 --> 00:36.318
The third thing that the suit has to do is control the astronaut's temperature.

00:36.571 --> 00:39.887
Now out in space, it is a balmy 250 degrees in the sun...

00:39.952 --> 00:42.550
...and a chilly minus 150 degrees in the shade.

00:43.075 --> 00:44.539
So you're gonna wear long underwear...

00:44.633 --> 00:48.760
...laced with tubing that's flowing with cooling water to keep everything chill.
