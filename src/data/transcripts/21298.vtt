Hi, I'm Nick Phillips with Hikes You Can Do.

00:14.609 --> 00:16.078
Hi, I'm Kevin with Hikes You Can Do.

00:16.175 --> 00:20.097
Hello everyone and welcome to a very special edition of Hikes You Can Do.

00:20.240 --> 00:23.123
Today, we find ourselves in the Big Santa Anita Canyon.

00:23.211 --> 00:25.846
We're gonna be doing a four to five-mile loop hike.

00:26.058 --> 00:28.687
And we're gonna be hiking on the Solstice Canyon trail.

00:29.942 --> 00:31.139
So, let's go check it out.

00:32.491 --> 00:36.429
We created Hikes You Can Do as a video information source...

00:36.776 --> 00:41.022
...for people to get a little bit of inspiration, a little bit of information.

00:41.131 --> 00:43.962
From the bridge, if you climb up towards the river,...

00:44.218 --> 00:47.126
...you get your own private bigger waterfall.

00:48.001 --> 00:54.664
It's okay to get away for physical fitness, for mental fitness; get out and go hiking.

00:54.914 --> 00:57.245
Get away from the city, get away from the traffic.

00:57.683 --> 01:02.238
Because when they go outside, they have this life-altering experiences.

01:02.372 --> 01:06.457
And then they share those experiences with their friends, their family.

01:06.770 --> 01:12.656
They come out and it all happened because of one little video that they saw online.

01:12.911 --> 01:14.663
We're trying to meld the technology.

01:14.969 --> 01:17.330
Use the computer to get you outside.

01:17.661 --> 01:22.071
You get the inspiration, you get in the car and then you go on a hike.
