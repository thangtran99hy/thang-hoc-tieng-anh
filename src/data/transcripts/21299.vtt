ï»¿Elisany Silva towers above her sisters.

00:07.951 --> 00:11.146
The 14-year-old measures in at six feet and nine inches...

00:11.358 --> 00:14.381
...or just over two meters and she wants to be a model.

00:19.253 --> 00:23.315
I think my size, my body which is very slim, my tiny waist,...

00:23.677 --> 00:27.646
...everyone who sees me tells me I could either be a basketball player or a model.

00:28.089 --> 00:29.344
But I'd rather be a model.

00:34.360 --> 00:38.419
But life for the Brazilian teen in a poor beachside neighborhood in Braganza...

00:38.679 --> 00:40.573
...is not without serious challenges.

00:41.145 --> 00:44.863
Silva was forced to quit school because she's too tall to ride the bus...

00:45.371 --> 00:47.951
...and constant headaches and muscle pain plague her.

00:48.915 --> 00:54.265
Silva's mother Ana Maria Cruz noticed her daughter's rapid growth when she was 11 years old.

00:56.279 --> 00:59.457
The doctors suspect I have a tumor in my pituitary gland...

00:59.771 --> 01:04.043
...and suggest that I undergo a laser tomography, but I never got a chance to do it.

01:08.217 --> 01:11.197
Silva's runway debut is scheduled for late September.

01:11.616 --> 01:16.487
The teen's story has attracted a massive media attention and she's basking in the limelight.

01:17.103 --> 01:18.929
Now I like to be a tall girl.

01:19.249 --> 01:20.814
It calls people's attention.

01:21.178 --> 01:24.072
Everyone looks at me, takes photos, films.

01:24.449 --> 01:28.527
And with any luck, her modeling career could soar to amazing heights.

01:28.991 --> 01:30.859
