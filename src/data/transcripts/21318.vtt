Thanksgiving Day.

00:04.467 --> 00:08.083
The very first Thanksgiving celebration in North America took place in Canada...

00:08.210 --> 00:13.585
...when Martin Frobisher, an explorer from England, arrived in Newfoundland in 1578.

00:15.049 --> 00:17.882
He wanted to give thanks for his safe arrival to the New World.

00:19.135 --> 00:21.784
For many Canadian families, the tradition has shifted...

00:21.875 --> 00:25.600
...and the focus is now to eat a large turkey dinner and get together with family.
