00:02.805 --> 00:06.564
Eid al-Adha, the Feast of Sacrifice, is upon us once again.

00:07.476 --> 00:10.469
People of all faiths and none can all take this opportunity,...

00:10.736 --> 00:13.296
...alongside Muslims in Britain and around the world,...

00:13.805 --> 00:18.549
...to reflect on the sacrifices we can make for the good of our communities.

00:19.435 --> 00:21.657
Sacrifices are being made all over the world,...

00:22.281 --> 00:25.557
...but our thoughts are particularly with the people of Syria.

00:26.533 --> 00:30.245
I recently went to Turkey where I met with representatives of the Red Crescent.

00:30.887 --> 00:33.453
I saw firsthand the vital work they're doing...

00:34.026 --> 00:36.686
...and I announced the British government will provide extra support...

00:37.004 --> 00:39.813
...to help 10,000 Syrian refugees this winter.

00:40.871 --> 00:43.779
This year, the Red Crescent are helping thousands of innocent people...

00:44.131 --> 00:47.799
...who've been caught in the fighting and who stand to lose so much.

00:48.743 --> 00:53.863
I look forward to continuing to work with the Muslim community here in Britain and abroad...

00:54.213 --> 00:58.537
...on the most important issues we face: helping people through the economic crisis,...

00:58.927 --> 01:03.999
...protecting and creating jobs, and bringing peace to Syria and Afghanistan.

01:04.917 --> 01:08.394
I would like to wish you all a sincere Eid Mubarak.
