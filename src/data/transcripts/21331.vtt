Is privacy looked at differently in Silicon Valley than in the rest of...

00:04.669 --> 00:06.600
No, Silicon Valley is not monolithic.

00:07.233 --> 00:13.068
We've always had a very different view of privacy than some of our colleagues in the Valley.

00:13.222 --> 00:15.865
We take privacy extremely seriously.

00:16.492 --> 00:21.989
As an example, we worry a lot about location in phones.

00:22.882 --> 00:28.060
And we worry that some 14-year-old is gonna get stalked...

00:28.241 --> 00:30.983
...and something terrible is gonna happen because of our phone.

00:32.275 --> 00:37.557
And so as an example, before any app can get location data,...

00:38.742 --> 00:42.352
...we don't make it a rule that they have to put up a panel and ask...

00:42.491 --> 00:44.798
...because they might not follow that rule.

00:45.140 --> 00:48.263
They call our location services and we put up the panel...

00:48.754 --> 00:53.317
...saying, "This app wants to use your location data, is that okay with you?"

00:53.746 --> 00:55.765
Every time they wanna use it.

00:56.855 --> 01:01.802
And we do a lot of things like that...

01:02.563 --> 01:08.208
...to ensure that people understand what these apps are doing.

01:08.514 --> 01:11.261
That's one of the reasons we have the curated app store.

01:11.574 --> 01:16.764
We have rejected a lot of apps that wanna take a lot of your personal data...

01:17.134 --> 01:21.077
...and suck it up into the cloud, a lot.

01:26.477 --> 01:29.820
A lot of people in the Valley think we're really old-fashioned about this.

01:30.961 --> 01:34.083
And maybe we are, but we worry about stuff like this.

01:34.160 --> 01:37.897
But aren't you also going to be moving more into cloud-based things?

01:38.967 --> 01:40.844
Are we gonna be moving more into cloud-based things?

01:41.039 --> 01:41.442
Sure.

01:43.077 --> 01:44.490
Doesn't that inevitably...

01:44.588 --> 01:53.910
No, privacy means people know what they're signing up for in plain English and repeatedly.

01:54.901 --> 01:55.853
That's what it means.

01:56.647 --> 01:58.939
I'm an optimist, I believe people are smart...

01:59.329 --> 02:01.902
...and some people want to share more data than other people do.

02:02.163 --> 02:02.801
Ask them.

02:03.643 --> 02:05.155
Ask them every time.

02:05.817 --> 02:09.790
Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them.

02:10.899 --> 02:14.349
Let them know precisely what you're gonna do with their data.
