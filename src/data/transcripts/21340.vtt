ï»¿Welcome to English in a Minute.

00:07.511 --> 00:12.582
What would you think if you're talking with an American and she said,...

00:13.149 --> 00:14.149
"...A heart of gold."

00:14.937 --> 00:15.785
Is she rich?

00:16.515 --> 00:17.552
Is she famous?

00:18.141 --> 00:20.137
Is her heart made of gold?

00:20.858 --> 00:24.420
Let's listen to see whether we can find out.

00:25.341 --> 00:28.233
Who helped you clean up after the big party the other night?

00:28.695 --> 00:29.437
Bob did.

00:29.537 --> 00:31.570
And he drove two other guests home.

00:32.054 --> 00:33.917
Wow! That was really nice.

00:34.276 --> 00:36.144
Bob definitely has a heart of gold.

00:36.590 --> 00:40.148
It sounds like Bob did something very nice.

00:40.813 --> 00:45.119
People who have a heart of gold are kind and caring.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.509
Gold is very valuable.

00:47.829 --> 00:52.324
And if you have a heart of gold, your actions have great value, too.

00:53.013 --> 00:55.687
This is a nice way to praise someone.

00:56.089 --> 00:58.127
And that's English in a Minute.
