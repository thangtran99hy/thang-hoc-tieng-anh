ï»¿The hands are the one missing piece in the puzzle still.

00:06.025 --> 00:09.039
There are a couple of different ways in which you can do the hands on a werewolf.

00:09.917 --> 00:15.347
Some people will put makeup on them, very similar to the face, exact same coloration,...

00:15.784 --> 00:18.597
...similar segments of design overshadowing over the knuckles.

00:19.056 --> 00:23.267
I prefer gloves which you can find for sale in a lot of various stores.

00:23.540 --> 00:24.206
Why is this?

00:24.461 --> 00:27.180
Well, gloves on the inside will have this cloth padding...

00:27.793 --> 00:29.890
...which will allow you to much more easily grip things...

00:30.003 --> 00:32.027
...and you won't have to worry about makeup coming off.

00:32.587 --> 00:37.359
Gloves, you can also easily take off if you want to be able to have a nice, bare clean hand,...

00:37.474 --> 00:42.445
...no makeup, no costume on, to open doors or even drive a car, say.

00:42.869 --> 00:47.063
So in general, gloves are a nice alternative to makeup...

00:47.343 --> 00:49.974
...and they can make for still a very, very effective show,...

00:50.180 --> 00:53.185
...and you won't have to worry about going out and getting Lee press-on nails either.

00:53.257 --> 00:57.627
I've seen some werewolves do that too, where they combine makeup with nail effects.
