There's been a little bit of distance now since the passing of Steve Jobs and...

00:05.935 --> 00:09.807
...you address some of the rivalry in the past.

00:09.891 --> 00:14.595
But I'm really intrigued by the anecdote at the end of Walter Isaacson's book...

00:14.666 --> 00:20.937
...you spoke about how in his final months you came to his house, came in through the kitchen,...

00:21.462 --> 00:24.159
...and the two of you spent a couple of hours together reminiscing...

00:24.238 --> 00:28.880
...and really made peace despite years of your ideological differences.

00:29.047 --> 00:30.607
What do you remember about that time?

00:32.247 --> 00:38.547
Well, Steve and I about four years ago had a joint interview at the D Conference...

00:38.621 --> 00:40.932
...where we talked about how exciting it had been.

00:41.193 --> 00:45.446
And in our career, the Macintosh work, the early work...

00:45.911 --> 00:52.458
...I'd bet Microsoft's future on and Steve had kind of bet his career on it.

00:53.351 --> 00:55.677
And that was our most intense working together.

00:56.125 --> 00:58.136
Before that, I'd done the BASIC for the Apple II,...

00:58.205 --> 01:01.189
...but that was more with Wozniak than with Steve.

01:01.646 --> 01:05.329
And so Steve had a very different set of skills than I did.

01:05.413 --> 01:12.794
He was every bit as intense, believed in revolutionary ways of using computers,...

01:13.637 --> 01:18.369
...but in a not kind of an engineer approach, more of a design approach.

01:18.453 --> 01:24.650
And that had huge strengths, particularly the last episode where he ran Apple,...

01:24.765 --> 01:27.213
...he was able to do incredible work.

01:27.444 --> 01:29.231
So he and I always enjoyed talking.

01:29.382 --> 01:35.409
He would throw some things out, some stimulating things.

01:35.521 --> 01:37.706
We talked about the other companies that had come along.

01:38.146 --> 01:44.009
We talked about our families and how lucky we've both been in terms of the women we married.

01:44.257 --> 01:47.552
It was great, relaxed conversation.
