We're here with Josh, one of the co-creators and producer of Halloween Haunted House.

00:04.354 --> 00:05.924
Josh, what are we about to get into?

00:06.099 --> 00:07.623
Some pretty hard-core stuff.

00:08.269 --> 00:12.197
We tried to create a new kind of haunted house where you have to walk through alone.

00:12.467 --> 00:15.991
Basically test your limits, push you as far as you can go...

00:16.083 --> 00:19.491
...and try to be as radically different from any of the other haunted houses in the city.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.906
And what is the best reaction you've seen so far?

00:22.225 --> 00:28.779
People crying, shaking, panic attacks, anxiety attacks.

00:30.573 --> 00:31.557
That's good for us.

00:31.638 --> 00:32.218
That's success.

00:32.290 --> 00:33.195
I think that's solid.

00:33.498 --> 00:35.383
I have no idea about any of this.

00:36.084 --> 00:36.554
All right.

00:43.623 --> 00:44.121
Oh god!

00:44.349 --> 00:45.705
Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god!
