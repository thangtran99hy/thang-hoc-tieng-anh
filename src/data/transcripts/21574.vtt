ï»¿It wasn't that long ago that little Prince George captured the world's attention with his arrival.

00:08.512 --> 00:13.653
Now, the third heir to the throne is set to make his second official appearance at his christening.

00:14.389 --> 00:18.772
The royal baby will be blessed in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace tomorrow...

00:19.109 --> 00:21.637
...and preparations are underway for his big day.

00:23.441 --> 00:27.274
The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who will baptize the prince,...

00:27.486 --> 00:30.309
...has released a special message ahead of the event.

00:32.313 --> 00:38.385
As a nation, we're celebrating the birth of someone who in due course will be the head of state.

00:39.025 --> 00:39.891
That's extraordinary.

00:39.995 --> 00:43.801
It gives you this sense of forward looking, of the forwardness of history,...

00:43.885 --> 00:50.267
...as well as the backwardness of history and what a gift to have this new life and to look forward.

00:50.661 --> 00:54.015
Taking a break from royal tradition, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge...

00:54.112 --> 00:59.571
...are having a private ceremony for their little one and are keen to keep the occasion as low-key as possible.

01:00.101 --> 01:01.910
Even the guest list has not been released.

01:02.291 --> 01:05.795
But Kensington Palace has said that close family members will attend.
