WEBVTT

00:01.959 --> 00:03.583
And without further ado,...

00:04.418 --> 00:08.335
...Mrs. Daughtry, would you like to present the MVP trophy for the American League?

00:09.620 --> 00:12.231
Koji, this award is for you.

00:15.515 --> 00:20.623
Koji Uehara was responsible in four of the wins in this series.

00:21.086 --> 00:25.699
He won one game and he saved three and he struck out nine batters.

00:25.789 --> 00:27.141
We're all very proud of you.

00:30.357 --> 00:32.231
Kaz, join your dad.

00:41.585 --> 00:47.183
I wanted to ask, what was it about this year that made Koji so dominant?

00:56.817 --> 01:00.282
All the credit goes to the staff, the players that supported me.

01:01.635 --> 01:04.533
What kind of pressure was on him every single night?

01:04.642 --> 01:06.743
Jon Lester told me after game five...

01:07.084 --> 01:10.179
...he was biting his nails when he was on the mound pulling for this guy.

01:10.365 --> 01:11.445
What pressure did he feel?

01:22.211 --> 01:24.912
To tell you the truth, I almost threw up.

01:28.191 --> 01:32.023
Kaz, let me ask you, your dad says he almost threw up out there.

01:32.331 --> 01:33.999
How did you feel when he was pitching?

01:34.961 --> 01:35.693
I don't know.

01:36.131 --> 01:36.861
You don't know?

01:37.133 --> 01:39.502
Did you get sick when he was out there or were you excited?

01:40.129 --> 01:40.840
Excited.
