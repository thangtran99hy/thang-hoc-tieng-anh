00:00.030 --> 00:03.791
So imagine, if you will, you've been dropped into an enchanted forest...

00:03.899 --> 00:05.959
...inhabited by an elderly witch.

00:06.339 --> 00:08.955
She's invited us for dinner and here's what's on the menu.

00:09.921 --> 00:12.822
We're gonna kick things off with a homemade pumpkin punch...

00:12.890 --> 00:15.495
...served in a real fairy tale pumpkin.

00:15.996 --> 00:18.565
Now I'll show you how to make my spooky bug bites...

00:18.799 --> 00:23.803
..which are broiled dates with salty Gorgonzola cheese topped with a crunchy walnut.

00:24.623 --> 00:28.943
Then, it's spider bites created with herbed cheese and black olives.

00:30.045 --> 00:32.921
For our main course, it's a yummy witch's stew...

00:33.061 --> 00:37.086
...made with wild mushrooms, roasted chicken and fresh rosemary.

00:38.007 --> 00:42.019
Then I'll show you my easy cheat for making cheesy corn bread muffins.

00:43.154 --> 00:47.310
Then, one of my favorite recipes for a crunchy fall harvest salad.

00:47.821 --> 00:51.525
And for dessert, it's my wickedly good chocolate fallen cake...

00:51.917 --> 00:55.955
...served with an eerie chocolate whipped cream and spooky meringue mushrooms.
