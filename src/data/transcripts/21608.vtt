ï»¿To get everyone in the Halloween mood,...

00:02.799 --> 00:07.229
...start off with a spooky gooey game and the kids love this one.

00:07.588 --> 00:09.793
It's called "Guess the Monster Parts."

00:10.117 --> 00:11.935
The kids put their hands inside the boxes...

00:12.249 --> 00:14.253
...and guess which part of the monster they're touching.

00:14.619 --> 00:18.235
So this one right here, grapes for the eyeballs.

00:18.632 --> 00:22.601
And this one here is some chopped up Jell-o for the monster's brains.

00:23.322 --> 00:26.507
And the monster's teeth are candy corn.

00:27.191 --> 00:30.631
The monsters got ears and those are dried apricots.

00:30.797 --> 00:35.566
And then this one is positively gross and the kids love it.

00:36.049 --> 00:39.030
Spaghetti for the intestines.

00:39.433 --> 00:43.413
The kids have a really fun time digging their hands in and guessing all the parts.
