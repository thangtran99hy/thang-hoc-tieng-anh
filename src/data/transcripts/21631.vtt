My name is Misa Kuranaga.

00:16.984 --> 00:18.586
I'm the principal dancer with Boston Ballet.

00:19.604 --> 00:20.619
I'm from Japan.

00:21.311 --> 00:24.535
I started taking ballet lessons at age seven.

00:25.664 --> 00:30.671
My friends were taking ballet classes so I asked my mom to take me to the ballet class.

00:31.283 --> 00:37.861
My mom didn't want me to dance so she took me to English class.

00:38.568 --> 00:42.509
But right in front of English class, there was this ballet class going on...

00:42.581 --> 00:47.061
...and I just didn't leave and I asked my mom to sign me up.

00:48.669 --> 00:55.143
I knew right away this is what I like to do and I felt comfortable.

00:55.849 --> 01:01.575
And somehow I knew, I had a feeling that I'm gonna be a professional dancer.

01:02.773 --> 01:08.122
When I first got to Boston Ballet, I had still training from the School of American Ballet,...

01:08.757 --> 01:12.199
...so I was very much Balanchine influenced.

01:13.013 --> 01:16.783
And then in Boston Ballet, we do a lot of Balanchine...

01:17.121 --> 01:19.945
...but of course we do a lot of classical and contemporary.

01:20.378 --> 01:26.419
So we're really a wide range repertoire company and I needed to learn all that.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.601
And I really enjoyed doing everything.

01:30.235 --> 01:32.245
When you do a full-length ballet,...

01:32.858 --> 01:38.069
...I think it's really important to really understand the role you are working on...

01:38.305 --> 01:42.787
...and when I don't do that, I just feel like I'm faking something.

01:42.869 --> 01:43.949
I do not like that.

01:44.469 --> 01:48.963
And I really enjoy the process of getting to know the role...

01:49.071 --> 01:56.689
...and getting into the role and then thinking about all the details and I just enjoy it very much.

01:58.097 --> 02:01.950
Performance, definitely, will keep you going.

02:02.749 --> 02:05.692
All the rehearsals that we are doing, of course they're hard.

02:06.031 --> 02:08.035
Every day is a hard life for us.

02:08.116 --> 02:09.283
It's not normal.

02:09.676 --> 02:12.865
We have to go through so much pain, so much dedication.

02:13.027 --> 02:16.864
You have to be really focused every day.

02:17.139 --> 02:21.305
But once you get onstage and feel the energy from the audience...

02:21.425 --> 02:23.799
...and the atmosphere of the theater and everything,...

02:23.929 --> 02:30.725
...you just forget everything about pain and suffering and everything in the rehearsal.

02:31.299 --> 02:32.977
That's how I keep going.
