On those cold, rainy days when you forget your rain jacket or umbrella...

00:03.178 --> 00:04.657
...and you want to stay as dry as possible,...

00:05.026 --> 00:07.138
...should you walk and spend more time in the rain?

00:07.453 --> 00:10.744
Or should you run, which means you'll be hitting more raindrops from the side?

00:11.098 --> 00:12.696
Assuming you haven't been fully soaked yet...

00:12.790 --> 00:15.331
...and you aren't jumping into puddles, the answer is simple.

00:15.659 --> 00:19.027
As you move out of the way of one falling raindrop, you move into the way of another.

00:19.232 --> 00:21.431
So the amount of rain hitting the top of you is constant,...

00:21.528 --> 00:22.735
...regardless of how fast you're going.

00:22.881 --> 00:25.375
If you're not moving, the rain from the top is all you'll get.

00:25.647 --> 00:28.393
But if you are moving, you'll also run into raindrops from the side...

00:28.476 --> 00:29.309
...and you'll get wetter.

00:29.546 --> 00:32.261
So in any given second, you stay driest by standing still,...

00:32.427 --> 00:34.445
...and the faster you move, the wetter you become.
