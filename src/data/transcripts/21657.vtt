00:04.637 --> 00:10.982
First, Koji, let me ask you, you said after the ALCS, all the pressure made you wanna throw up,...

00:11.470 --> 00:13.659
...the pressure of the World Series feel?

00:14.275 --> 00:17.859
Last time I almost threw up, this time I almost cried.

00:21.392 --> 00:27.250
Koji, you actually put in your blog after you won the ALCS, "I'm afraid this isn't real."

00:27.675 --> 00:29.948
How real does winning a World Series feel now?

00:36.459 --> 00:39.301
I still feel that I'm in a dream.

00:41.677 --> 00:45.933
All right, Kaz, you were the rock star of the ALCS trophy presentation.

00:46.150 --> 00:47.665
You haven't been to school in quite a while.

00:47.861 --> 00:51.946
You said you were excited for your dad, how proud are you of your dad tonight?

00:52.751 --> 00:53.351
Good.

00:54.961 --> 00:57.302
How hard are you gonna celebrate tonight, Kaz?

00:58.963 --> 00:59.594
Crazy!

01:02.413 --> 01:03.425
Congratulations!

01:03.630 --> 01:04.977
Thank you guys so much.
