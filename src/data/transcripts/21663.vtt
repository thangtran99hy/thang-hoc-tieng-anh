00:00.651 --> 00:06.964
ï»¿When the aliens first invaded, they nearly destroyed us.

00:11.113 --> 00:12.232
They will be back.

00:14.690 --> 00:16.273
There's greatness in you, Ender.

00:17.959 --> 00:19.223
The world needs you.

00:21.046 --> 00:22.295
You are bred for this.

00:23.627 --> 00:25.883
You see things in a way we can't.

00:27.100 --> 00:29.621
You alone can understand the enemy.

00:31.595 --> 00:35.407
You will be the one to save mankind.

00:38.736 --> 00:41.160
Unless we act now, Earth will be annihilated.

00:41.665 --> 00:42.463
We're out of time.

00:46.133 --> 00:46.834
He's not ready.

00:47.319 --> 00:48.134
You're never ready.

00:48.696 --> 00:49.784
You'll know when you're ready enough.

00:51.024 --> 00:52.080
Track them from below the ice.

00:52.682 --> 00:53.180
Shoot straight.

00:53.918 --> 00:54.449
Stay calm.

00:54.769 --> 00:55.230
Here we go.

00:55.620 --> 00:56.095
Fire!

01:00.461 --> 01:01.727
I've never seen anyone do that.

01:06.023 --> 01:06.953
They should tell him the truth.

01:07.427 --> 01:07.806
Why?

01:11.925 --> 01:13.709
When it's over, what would be left of the boy?

01:14.005 --> 01:15.858
What does it matter if there's nothing left at all?

01:17.040 --> 01:19.555
If you don't try then we will all be lost.

01:20.093 --> 01:21.938
I'll do everything I can to win this war.

01:23.113 --> 01:25.905
If you succeed, you will be remembered as a hero.

01:26.818 --> 01:28.777
He's abandoning his entire fleet.

01:29.969 --> 01:32.113
He's in command, there's no stopping him now.

01:33.496 --> 01:37.074
In three, two, one!

01:38.095 --> 01:38.771
Now!
