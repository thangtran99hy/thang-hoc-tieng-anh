The A, number one most critical thing at a party is to have good lighting.

00:04.304 --> 00:06.183
First of all, turn off the overheads.

00:06.319 --> 00:08.561
Number one rule: just turn them all off.

00:08.913 --> 00:12.378
Additionally, I would say candles everywhere.

00:12.697 --> 00:16.747
When you fill a room with candles, little magical things happen,...

00:16.963 --> 00:22.364
...like little reflections. If you have a mirror and you've got candles in front of it...

00:22.451 --> 00:25.310
...and you've got a lot of silver and maybe some mixed metals,...

00:25.384 --> 00:28.568
...that creates all that sparkle and reflection.

00:28.725 --> 00:30.097
It feels so festive.

00:30.163 --> 00:31.643
It feels like you really tried.
