00:01.085 --> 00:04.443
The situation determines the type of greeting or introduction,...

00:04.796 --> 00:07.022
...formal or informal, that you should use.

00:07.839 --> 00:11.033
A ball game gives us an example of an informal greeting.

00:13.665 --> 00:14.574
Hello, Johnny.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.675
Hi, have I missed much of the game?

00:16.788 --> 00:17.963
Only three to four minutes.

00:18.048 --> 00:22.834
In some situations, with people that you know well, informal behavior is correct.

00:24.563 --> 00:29.040
Even in informal introductions, a girl's name is usually mentioned first.

00:29.381 --> 00:31.115
Kathy, this is my best friend Bruce.

00:31.694 --> 00:33.501
Kathy is my cousin from Colorado.

00:33.583 --> 00:34.315
How are you?

00:34.502 --> 00:38.349
It's a good idea to supply some information about each person you are introducing.

00:44.651 --> 00:47.851
You use the formal type of greeting or introduction in situations...

00:47.952 --> 00:50.974
...that are outside your family or circle of very close friends.

00:51.237 --> 00:51.995
For example:...

00:52.775 --> 00:55.384
Dr. Phil, I want you to meet my son Stewart.

00:55.995 --> 00:57.425
How do you do, Dr. Phil?

00:57.873 --> 00:58.555
Hi, Stewart.

00:58.876 --> 01:00.192
It's real nice to meet you, son.

01:02.339 --> 01:05.305
Formal introductions are necessary in many situations.

01:05.725 --> 01:08.405
Let's look at a few typical examples that you may encounter.

01:08.845 --> 01:11.488
Suppose your school is having an open house for parents.

01:11.859 --> 01:16.219
If your teacher and your parents have never met, it's up to you to make the introductions.

01:16.684 --> 01:17.955
Hi Janet, how are you?

01:18.244 --> 01:18.747
Fine.

01:19.015 --> 01:22.807
Mrs. Stevens, I'd like you to meet my parents, Mr. and Mrs. Sanders.

01:22.958 --> 01:23.537
How do you do?

01:24.079 --> 01:27.414
It's proper to mention first the name of the person you wish to honor.

01:27.690 --> 01:31.338
Since the teacher is outside of your family, her name is mentioned first.
