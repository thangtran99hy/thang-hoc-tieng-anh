Happy birthday!

00:01.085 --> 00:01.617
Anniversary.

00:01.699 --> 00:03.213
Happy Anniversary Christmas.

00:04.395 --> 00:05.653
We'd like to talk to you about something.

00:07.655 --> 00:09.311
We haven't been entirely honest with you.

00:10.037 --> 00:12.313
We aren't only spending time with you.

00:13.687 --> 00:16.063
We didn't see each other as an item so we didn't see any harm.

00:16.639 --> 00:22.391
We're spending time with YouTube but also with Twitter.

00:25.337 --> 00:26.797
You had your chance at wine and you blew it.

00:27.174 --> 00:29.055
We're not spending any more time with them than we are with you.

00:29.132 --> 00:31.210
It's just, well, they're easier.

00:31.919 --> 00:32.485
But we didn't do much.

00:32.568 --> 00:33.903
No, no nothing bad.

00:34.165 --> 00:35.445
Just tap some buttons.

00:35.513 --> 00:37.199
Just watching mostly.

00:37.449 --> 00:39.618
Yeah. You can join in if you like.

00:39.694 --> 00:41.061
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the more the merrier.

00:41.974 --> 00:42.369
Yeah?

00:42.628 --> 00:46.661
No? No. Nein to that.

00:46.841 --> 00:47.551
No, bad.

00:50.519 --> 00:51.235
But there's more.

00:55.331 --> 01:01.027
I don't want to be the one to tell you this, so Dean.

01:02.119 --> 01:03.709
What? I can't.

01:03.837 --> 01:04.794
Don't make it any worse.

01:08.249 --> 01:09.228
We have a second channel.

01:09.321 --> 01:11.986
And don't think it's because you're not good enough because that's not why.

01:12.412 --> 01:13.657
She just lets us do different things.

01:13.730 --> 01:15.585
Things that you don't let us do.

01:15.843 --> 01:16.806
Yeah, what's that all about?

01:17.381 --> 01:18.055
Don't cry.

01:19.155 --> 01:20.005
There's good news as well.

01:20.079 --> 01:21.455
Hey, we're starting a podcast.

01:22.060 --> 01:23.195
Why are you still crying?

01:23.266 --> 01:24.189
No, it's not a bad thing.

01:24.256 --> 01:25.109
We're not leaving you to do it.

01:25.491 --> 01:26.705
We're doing it alongside.

01:26.901 --> 01:28.321
It's more things for you.

01:28.837 --> 01:30.607
Why is this so difficult?

01:32.849 --> 01:35.855
You see, this is what happens when you get in a relationship with 60,000 people, Jack.

01:36.012 --> 01:36.779
They get all clingy.
