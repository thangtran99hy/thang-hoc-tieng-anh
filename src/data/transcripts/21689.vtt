00:05.490 --> 00:06.363
Good evening, my lady.

00:07.503 --> 00:09.022
Good evening, good sir.

00:09.298 --> 00:10.655
How are you this evening?

00:10.859 --> 00:14.788
I find myself to be most excellent this evening, yes I do.

00:14.892 --> 00:19.512
And how do you find the tidings at Downton Abbey?

00:19.946 --> 00:20.619
My god.

00:21.535 --> 00:23.839
Please don't tell me that you should practice this accent.

00:24.590 --> 00:25.011
How are you?

00:25.725 --> 00:26.457
I'm good, thanks.

00:26.587 --> 00:27.089
How are you?

00:27.250 --> 00:27.514
No.

00:27.988 --> 00:30.837
Come on now, enough of this "I'm good, thanks" stuff.

00:31.618 --> 00:32.090
How you doin'?

00:32.853 --> 00:33.286
Honestly.

00:33.878 --> 00:34.464
Honestly?

00:34.769 --> 00:35.389
Yes.

00:36.287 --> 00:38.662
Honestly, I don't know.

00:40.482 --> 00:42.307
You know, this is our fourth date and what does it mean?

00:43.275 --> 00:48.153
And this is a risk I'm willing to take because I like you.

00:49.521 --> 00:51.339
And I really don't want to screw this up.

00:59.282 --> 01:00.018
I like you too.

01:02.289 --> 01:02.655
I do.

01:05.767 --> 01:06.585
Shall I come in, or...

01:07.328 --> 01:08.916
I'm actually, I'm ready to go.

01:09.447 --> 01:09.593
Okay.

01:10.757 --> 01:11.740
My British accent is not that bad.

01:12.039 --> 01:12.789
Oh, it's real bad.
