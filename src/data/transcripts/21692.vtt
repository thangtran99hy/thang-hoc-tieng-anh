Zoosk presents "From the Heart".

00:02.748 --> 00:03.334
Welcome.

00:03.969 --> 00:06.118
Today's topic is wooing.

00:06.621 --> 00:10.889
One of you asked, "Can someone use flattery and still seem to be honest?"

00:11.783 --> 00:13.985
Entirely too smart of a question I think.

00:14.815 --> 00:17.303
But of course, if it comes from an honest place,...

00:17.739 --> 00:20.360
...if you mean it and are sincere, she'll know.

00:20.897 --> 00:23.409
It's all in the voice, the intonation.

00:24.318 --> 00:28.477
Like if you wanna tell her she has beautiful eyes, just say it like this,...

00:29.983 --> 00:32.689
"Your eyes are like the stars,"...

00:33.191 --> 00:36.361
"...pinpricks in the curtain of your night face."

00:37.479 --> 00:39.147
Anyway, hope that helps.
