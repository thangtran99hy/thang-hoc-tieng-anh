By the time "Innuendo" was released in 1991,...

00:06.149 --> 00:09.097
...it was impossible to disguise that Freddie was seriously ill.

00:09.438 --> 00:13.596
Despite his frail appearance, the band continued to make videos in support of the album.

00:15.221 --> 00:20.006
We made a whole album, "Innuendo", knowing that this was happening.

00:20.221 --> 00:24.190
If you listen to it now, it's made with the knowledge that we don't have much longer.

00:25.013 --> 00:27.261
And Freddie doesn't have much longer on the planet.

00:31.059 --> 00:33.797
Freddie retired to the privacy of his Kensington Estate.

00:34.699 --> 00:37.531
Britain's tabloid press stalked him night and day,...

00:37.682 --> 00:39.823
...turning him into a prisoner in his own home.

00:40.523 --> 00:42.663
His friends insisted that nothing was wrong.

00:42.899 --> 00:45.609
But finally, Freddie could no longer hide his secret.

00:51.171 --> 00:54.197
On Saturday, November 23, 1991,...

00:54.433 --> 00:57.853
...he released a statement to the press acknowledging that he had AIDS.

01:02.930 --> 01:07.119
A little over 24 hours after issuing the statement, Freddie Mercury died.

01:07.408 --> 01:08.837
He was 46 years old.

01:21.349 --> 01:24.827
Freddie left a bulk of his estate to his soul mate Mary Austin.

01:25.639 --> 01:28.265
Fans from all over the world sent cards and flowers.

01:28.822 --> 01:32.072
A small cremation service was held three days after his death,..

01:32.299 --> 01:35.647
...conducted in the ancient Zoroastrian faith of Freddie's parents.

01:40.811 --> 01:43.336
Farrokh Bulsara had finally come home.
