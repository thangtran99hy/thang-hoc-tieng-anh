00:01.791 --> 00:07.056
ï»¿It was at the 11th  hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918...

00:07.438 --> 00:09.784
...that the guns fell silent around Europe.

00:10.327 --> 00:13.926
The legacy of the devastating loss of life in the First World War...

00:14.259 --> 00:16.456
...has shaped the way we remember our dead.

00:16.894 --> 00:21.955
Many of the traditions now so familiar come from the determination of one generation:...

00:22.148 --> 00:24.579
...not to forget what they've lived through.

00:25.751 --> 00:27.391
The idea of the two-minute silence,...

00:27.448 --> 00:31.076
...observed at that 11th hour came in a letter to a newspaper.

00:31.391 --> 00:34.357
Published in a London evening news in May 1919,...

00:34.631 --> 00:37.167
...it caught the imagination of King George V.

00:37.492 --> 00:40.545
A royal proclamation was issued, calling for the silence...

00:40.835 --> 00:42.459
...so that the thoughts of everybody...

00:42.528 --> 00:46.585
...should be concentrated on reverent remembrance of the glorious dead.
