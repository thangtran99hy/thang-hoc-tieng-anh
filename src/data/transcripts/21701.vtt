Hey Lisa, it's Kip.

00:03.458 --> 00:06.836
We should chat on the phone sometime soon, smiley face.

00:06.911 --> 00:08.075
That's not a smiley face.

00:08.335 --> 00:09.543
That's a winky face.

00:09.646 --> 00:13.613
You're gonna e-mail her your phone number and think that's gonna get you somewhere.

00:13.857 --> 00:15.304
Why didn't he ask for my number, though?

00:16.433 --> 00:17.814
He must have a pager.

00:18.462 --> 00:20.118
You obviously don't understand women.

00:20.327 --> 00:21.744
What I just did was brilliant.

00:21.843 --> 00:23.217
I can't call him right away 'cause that'd be weird and...

00:23.298 --> 00:26.091
...I can't respond right away because then he'd be like, "Why didn't you just call me?"

00:26.189 --> 00:28.622
I made the first contact, that's aggressive.

00:28.703 --> 00:31.088
And then I just gave her my contact for my phone.

00:31.201 --> 00:32.786
That's like, whatever, I don't care.

00:33.021 --> 00:36.521
Oh wait hold on, I got an e-mail. It looks like it's Lisa.

00:36.659 --> 00:37.551
Let's open that.

00:37.651 --> 00:38.011
All right.

00:38.136 --> 00:43.654
Oh well, she e-mailed me her number.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.577
But before... hey, shut up.

00:50.395 --> 00:51.369
So, should I call him?

00:51.493 --> 00:51.779
No.

00:51.993 --> 00:53.182
So then what am I supposed to do?

00:53.279 --> 00:54.261
You can't call him.

00:54.376 --> 00:55.587
Text before call.

00:56.263 --> 00:58.660
You don't go from e-mail to phone call.

00:59.018 --> 01:02.495
You go from e-mail to text to third-party messenger.

01:02.594 --> 01:04.750
How about, "Hey Lisa, yo what's up?"

01:04.933 --> 01:06.431
No, keep "yo" out of this.

01:06.617 --> 01:07.407
"Hey, Lisa."

01:07.547 --> 01:08.738
"Hey, Lisa." That's a good start.

01:09.043 --> 01:12.355
"Hey Kip, it's Lisa. How you doing?"

01:13.104 --> 01:14.134
"How are you doing?"
