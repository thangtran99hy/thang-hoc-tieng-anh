Stress is a part of life, and it's not always a bad part of life.

00:05.632 --> 00:08.357
Most of us enjoy good stress in small doses...

00:08.690 --> 00:12.535
...like roller coasters, watching sports or even a scary movie.

00:13.256 --> 00:17.063
That's the kind of stress that keeps us young and on our toes.

00:17.562 --> 00:21.315
Then there's bad stress, or worse, chronic stress.

00:21.759 --> 00:26.733
Negative stress isn't just in your head, it can affect us both mentally and physically.

00:28.074 --> 00:32.980
Stress hormones in the body for extended periods of time can physically age our cells.

00:34.281 --> 00:37.919
So when you're stressed at work or home, your cells look and act older,...

00:38.255 --> 00:41.415
...making you look older and even impacting your immune system.

00:42.213 --> 00:46.197
Not only does it add years to your appearance, it can also affect your memory,...

00:46.520 --> 00:48.646
...making brain cells shrink permanently.

00:49.281 --> 00:52.741
Even short-term stress can make it hard for you to remember simple things.

00:53.277 --> 00:55.817
The good news is, you can manage stress now...

00:55.947 --> 00:58.507
...to prevent more damage to your body and mind tomorrow.

00:59.049 --> 01:01.797
Stress management is a skill that can be learned.
