00:02.686 --> 00:05.996
Stand tall, walk tall, drive tall?

00:06.481 --> 00:07.261
What's up everyone?

00:07.334 --> 00:09.327
I'm Andrew Dymburt with Buzz60.

00:09.685 --> 00:13.948
With car companies' everlasting competition to create more sleek automotives,...

00:14.249 --> 00:17.793
...tall drivers are left asking, "Does this thing even come in my size?"

00:18.291 --> 00:23.413
Balancing comfort, luxury and space is a difficult task for car manufacturers.

00:23.978 --> 00:26.629
Designers use government standards to make vehicles for people...

00:26.711 --> 00:29.822
...within a height span of four foot eleven to six foot two.

00:30.171 --> 00:32.850
That's about 90% of the driving population.

00:33.289 --> 00:34.795
But what about that other 10%?

00:35.104 --> 00:38.342
I may have retired from the game, but not from being big.

00:38.848 --> 00:41.006
Good thing one car gives me full-size luxury.

00:41.466 --> 00:44.945
More cars are offering features like telescoping steering wheels....

00:45.192 --> 00:48.668
...and movable foot pedals to make traditionally small cars...

00:48.851 --> 00:52.401
...like the Kia Soul and Fiat 500L surprisingly roomy.

00:52.664 --> 00:57.241
And other features such as rearview back up cam now make it easier for shorter drivers,...

00:57.436 --> 00:59.105
...to compensate for blind spots.

00:59.537 --> 01:03.116
These items once considered a luxury now typically come standard.

01:03.417 --> 01:06.595
Whatever your size needs may be when shopping for a new ride,...

01:06.981 --> 01:08.843
...it's no longer one tall order.

01:09.230 --> 01:10.027
Buzz60.

01:10.249 --> 01:11.753
Now you know, pass it on.
