00:05.552 --> 00:06.641
This is Tony.

00:06.950 --> 00:08.343
He grows apples,...

00:09.024 --> 00:10.965
...but he was having a little problem.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.406
Apples are very small,...

00:13.701 --> 00:15.261
...but the trees are very big,...

00:15.363 --> 00:19.519
...so they take up lots of land and it's getting quite costly to grow them in Britain.

00:20.557 --> 00:24.546
Soon, we might have to fly them all in from faraway places,...

00:24.743 --> 00:27.459
...and there wouldn't be as many jobs for British farmers.

00:27.887 --> 00:29.633
So Tony had to ask himself,...

00:29.828 --> 00:33.969
..."How do you make lots of big things fit in one small space?"

00:35.963 --> 00:39.695
Well, in all my years, I've never seen anything like it.

00:40.181 --> 00:43.001
One day, Tony remembered being on holiday in France...

00:43.099 --> 00:45.779
...and seeing all the grapes growing in lines.

00:46.731 --> 00:51.175
And also, apple trees stretched out across the walls at Versailles.

00:51.770 --> 00:53.835
He thought, "How flat they were!"

00:54.702 --> 00:56.572
Then he had an amazing idea.

00:56.737 --> 00:59.408
What if he could make his trees grow in lines too?

00:59.663 --> 01:02.589
Then he'd have room for plenty more apples.

01:03.406 --> 01:06.342
Tony called some of his friends at a place called Sainsbury's,...

01:06.442 --> 01:09.109
...and together, he spoke to some very clever people...

01:09.235 --> 01:12.610
...who worked out that you can grow flat apple trees.

01:12.754 --> 01:15.855
Then they realized, these trees don't just save space,...

01:16.381 --> 01:18.979
...they drink much, much less water too.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.746
And believe me, trees like to drink.

01:21.892 --> 01:27.275
Soon, Tony and other Sainsbury's farmers had planted whole fields of flat trees,...

01:27.366 --> 01:28.419
...which means at Sainsbury's,...

01:28.489 --> 01:34.271
...you can have a choice of 57 varieties of British apple for years to come.
