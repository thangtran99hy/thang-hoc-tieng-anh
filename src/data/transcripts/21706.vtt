Hi, I'm Jordan DeFrank from Family Fun,...

00:07.337 --> 00:09.744
...here to show you how to make marshmallow Pilgrim hat treats.

00:10.580 --> 00:11.897
For this recipe, you'll need:...

00:12.136 --> 00:16.091
...chocolate striped shortbread cookies, a 12-ounce package of chocolate chips,...

00:16.696 --> 00:22.449
...marshmallows, skewers, white fruit chew and yellow decorator's frosting.

00:23.069 --> 00:26.034
You can find the complete recipe at familyfunmag.com.

00:26.797 --> 00:30.284
Set the chocolate striped cookies stripes down on a wax paper-covered tray,...

00:30.435 --> 00:31.413
...spacing them well apart.

00:32.108 --> 00:34.729
Melt the chocolate chips in a microwave or double boiler.

00:35.407 --> 00:37.900
One at a time, stick a skewer into a marshmallow.

00:38.379 --> 00:42.467
Dip the marshmallow into the melted chocolate and promptly center it atop a cookie.

00:43.394 --> 00:45.826
Set the hats in the refrigerator until the chocolate sets.

00:46.669 --> 00:50.748
Using scissors, cut a quarter-inch strip of white fruit chew and wrap it around the hat.

00:51.809 --> 00:54.905
Pipe a yellow decorator's frosting buckle on the front of each hat.

00:56.651 --> 00:59.612
Crunchy and sweet, these marshmallow Pilgrim hat treats ...

00:59.690 --> 01:02.574
...are a great way to cap a Thanksgiving classroom party.
