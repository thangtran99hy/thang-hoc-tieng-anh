00:02.777 --> 00:05.286
Ma'am, are you okay?

00:05.580 --> 00:08.541
It didn't seem real because of what was going on around.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.612
You know, traffic was going as normal.

00:11.036 --> 00:12.487
Pedestrians were going by as normal.

00:12.666 --> 00:13.861
Ma'am, are you okay?

00:14.459 --> 00:15.703
She was distraught.

00:15.798 --> 00:16.331
She was distant.

00:16.394 --> 00:17.933
She was really disconnected.

00:18.047 --> 00:23.751
I grabbed her and I grabbed her arm and I put my arm around her and I said,...

00:23.828 --> 00:26.087
..."Do you wanna come on this side of the guardrail?"

00:27.357 --> 00:30.205
And that was actually the first time she actually spoke to me.

00:30.297 --> 00:31.441
She said, "Yes."

00:31.652 --> 00:32.291
It was meant to be.

00:32.639 --> 00:36.891
I was supposed to be there for her at that moment.

00:37.041 --> 00:38.156
And I was.

00:38.281 --> 00:40.915
I wanted to convey that whatever it was...

00:41.805 --> 00:43.599
...we're gonna help you through whatever it is.

00:43.671 --> 00:47.490
And it's not as serious as jumping onto the 198.

00:52.191 --> 00:53.849
I felt like I did what I was supposed to do at the time.

00:56.171 --> 01:00.007
I'm a football guy, so when you sit on a bench and the coach calls your number,...

01:00.091 --> 01:01.397
...you gotta go in there and make a play...

01:01.491 --> 01:07.060
...and you gotta do what the play calls for and I think that's what I did.
