00:00.005 --> 00:02.875
ï»¿The sun and Jupiter have a lot in common.

00:03.063 --> 00:07.845
The sun is made almost entirely of hydrogen and helium.

00:08.421 --> 00:10.827
There's a sprinkling of the other elements,...

00:11.263 --> 00:13.320
...but mostly hydrogen and helium.

00:14.893 --> 00:20.459
But Jupiter is made of almost exactly the same stuff as the sun.

00:20.621 --> 00:25.469
And yet Jupiter has a higher concentration of these heavier elements in it.

00:26.037 --> 00:28.189
These elements are heavier.

00:28.612 --> 00:31.044
They're more massive than hydrogen or helium.

00:31.664 --> 00:36.342
So, you might have expected them to fall into the center of the solar system,...

00:36.428 --> 00:39.929
...but no, they are stuck way out here at Jupiter.

00:40.047 --> 00:41.417
Now, these elements are significant,...

00:41.556 --> 00:45.553
...because these are the elements that make up the earth and you and me.

00:45.807 --> 00:47.721
And you know why they're out here in Jupiter?

00:48.481 --> 00:51.501
Nobody knows why, that's why we're sending the Juno mission out there.
