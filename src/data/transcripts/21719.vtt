Skillshare is a learning community...

00:03.437 --> 00:07.877
...where people can learn real-world skills from anyone, anywhere, all over the world.

00:12.731 --> 00:17.038
When I happened upon Skillshare, I was sort of blown away by this idea...

00:17.121 --> 00:20.641
...that learning can mean so many different things to so many different people.

00:21.041 --> 00:22.985
We started with offline local classes...

00:23.089 --> 00:26.473
...where people can just raise their hand and say they wanna teach something...

00:26.907 --> 00:30.591
...and gather people locally in their community to teach them that skill.

00:31.131 --> 00:34.611
Before going online, we really studied the local classes...

00:34.665 --> 00:36.286
...and the behavior of the students and the teachers...

00:36.359 --> 00:39.823
...and we took that behavior to inform the classroom model online.

00:40.674 --> 00:44.337
The real hurdle or challenge, if you wanna say it that way,...

00:44.394 --> 00:46.187
...was getting people to learn from total strangers...

00:46.294 --> 00:49.285
...who weren't accredited in any specific thing.

00:49.424 --> 00:53.252
Learning how to make fried chicken from just a great fried chicken maker...

00:53.335 --> 00:55.453
...as opposed to the chef of XY and Z restaurant...

00:56.094 --> 00:58.007
...is a little bit of a paradigm shift.

00:58.695 --> 01:00.097
But once it took off, it took off.

01:00.527 --> 01:02.549
The premise of Skillshare is to learn real-world skills...

01:02.712 --> 01:07.015
...so not academic, History 101.

01:07.327 --> 01:10.797
This is, "I want to learn how to cook."

01:10.904 --> 01:12.007
"I wanna learn how to make jewelry."

01:12.085 --> 01:13.071
"I wanna learn design."

01:13.593 --> 01:16.837
I don't think that Skillshare will ever replace traditional education.

01:16.907 --> 01:18.300
That's definitely not the goal.

01:18.929 --> 01:20.443
The goal is to shake things up a little bit.
