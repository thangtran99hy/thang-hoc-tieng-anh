ï»¿Losing weight properly usually means losing it slowly,...

00:03.386 --> 00:05.537
...by making real changes in your daily life.

00:06.016 --> 00:10.154
Losing weight fast is possible, but it's usually not the healthiest way.

00:10.789 --> 00:15.673
That said, there are definitely times in your life when you want to lose a few pounds fast.

00:15.929 --> 00:19.229
And in those cases, there are ways to do it in a healthy manner.

00:19.912 --> 00:25.139
For four days, get rid of all refined and processed carbs, sugar, artificial sweeteners,...

00:25.279 --> 00:28.165
...and even your healthy carbs like whole grains.

00:28.419 --> 00:30.389
This is a temporary abstention.

00:30.966 --> 00:34.384
Whole grains are really good for you and should be a part of your regular diet.

00:34.995 --> 00:38.425
Remove all carbonated drinks because bubbles can lead to bloat.

00:38.909 --> 00:42.304
Cut out as much sodium as possible and no alcohol either.

00:42.734 --> 00:44.491
What can you eat for those four days?

00:44.689 --> 00:46.114
Stick to regular meals,...

00:46.387 --> 00:50.258
...three meals and two snacks of lean protein like fish and eggs,...

00:50.601 --> 00:54.253
...loads of green veggies and small portions of healthy fats...

00:54.357 --> 00:55.897
...from nuts, avocado and olive oil.

00:56.259 --> 00:58.227
And drink lots of water and green tea.

00:58.847 --> 01:01.635
So remember, losing a few pounds fast isn't ideal...

01:01.845 --> 01:04.288
...but it can be done safely if you do it right...

01:04.409 --> 01:07.215
...and do not make this way of eating a regular habit.

01:07.566 --> 01:11.112
You can cut a few pounds while still feeling just a little bit better.
