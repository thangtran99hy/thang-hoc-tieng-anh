Hello guys.

00:01.427 --> 00:02.572
Glad to meet you.

00:02.751 --> 00:03.798
Do you know who I am?

00:04.045 --> 00:06.434
I'm part of an army that's everywhere.

00:06.729 --> 00:07.249
What?

00:07.438 --> 00:09.193
You don't see us around you?

00:09.396 --> 00:11.892
We're very, very, very tiny.

00:12.276 --> 00:14.518
You can't see us with open eyes.

00:14.755 --> 00:17.279
You can only see us under a microscope.

00:17.537 --> 00:18.965
But we're everywhere.

00:19.103 --> 00:24.316
On the doorknob, on the table, on your skin, everywhere.

00:24.686 --> 00:28.659
We're also called microbes as we can only be seen under a microscope.

00:28.911 --> 00:31.041
And some people call us germs, too.

00:31.415 --> 00:33.247
Germs, yes, germs!

00:33.327 --> 00:35.852
We can cause many diseases.
