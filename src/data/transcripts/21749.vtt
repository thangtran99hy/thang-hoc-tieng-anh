The Filipiniana Restaurant is a popular gathering spot in Houston for Filipinos...

00:06.727 --> 00:08.850
...and the many Americans who like their food.

00:09.251 --> 00:10.433
But when business slows,...

00:10.501 --> 00:15.600
...manager Carlos Chavez and his friends keep an eye on news reports from the Philippines.

00:15.968 --> 00:21.241
It's unimaginable and the only thing is, sometimes you cry,...

00:21.316 --> 00:27.536
...and it's kind of hard to think of what happened.

00:28.367 --> 00:33.505
The restaurant is hosting fundraising events to help people left homeless by the storm.

00:34.060 --> 00:39.926
Fundraising for victims is also a priority for the Philippine Nurses Association of America,...

00:40.232 --> 00:43.548
...one of the largest Philippine organizations in the United States.

00:43.945 --> 00:48.193
Members from the Houston area are also planning fundraising events.

00:48.879 --> 00:51.077
We already have 5,000 dollars in the bank.

00:51.120 --> 00:54.700
Pam Windle is the organization's regional vice president.

00:54.947 --> 01:00.297
A lot of people are interested in joining us, and a lot of people are wanting to give money...

01:00.423 --> 01:04.418
...because we are trying to donate the money back home,...

01:04.553 --> 01:06.619
...to send some money to help them out.

01:06.951 --> 01:11.479
One event is a walk in a park where each participant is funded by donors.

01:11.874 --> 01:14.997
Even though the organizers are not from the stricken areas,...

01:15.079 --> 01:18.299
...some, like Gina Shankar, have close friends there.

01:18.589 --> 01:21.566
It took her four days to contact her friends in Tacloban.

01:21.880 --> 01:29.053
They're doing fine, but they are really in need of food and the place is really a mess.

01:29.325 --> 01:32.716
Of foreign-born nurses working in US health facilities,...

01:32.789 --> 01:35.357
...nearly one-third are from the Philippines.

01:35.853 --> 01:40.025
Pam Windle says they cannot help but think of those in need back home.

01:40.257 --> 01:46.261
But it is so hard to go home because it is an 18 to 20-hour flight.

01:46.911 --> 01:49.039
Plus you can't go through the province...

01:49.100 --> 01:52.021
...unless you have the military people to help you.

01:52.669 --> 01:54.201
She says, in the months ahead,...

01:54.525 --> 01:59.110
...medical services and personnel will still be in great need in the disaster zone...

01:59.419 --> 02:02.871
...and many Philippine nurses plan to return as volunteers.

02:03.426 --> 02:06.192
