00:03.220 --> 00:08.788
I've had my ups and downs, my fair share of bumpy roads and heavy winds.

00:10.175 --> 00:12.551
That's what made me what I am today.

00:13.734 --> 00:15.720
Now, I stand here before you.

00:17.142 --> 00:19.605
What you see is a body crafted to perfection,...

00:20.890 --> 00:24.400
...a pair of legs engineered to defy the laws of physics...

00:25.549 --> 00:29.831
...and a mindset to master the most epic of splits.
