I'm sorry, it's a little bit out of line, isn't it?

00:25.157 --> 00:26.775
I'm so sorry for everything.

00:30.583 --> 00:33.959
Oh, please forgive me for doubting you, my prince.

00:36.855 --> 00:39.191
I just hope you can find it in your heart to forgive us.

00:42.878 --> 00:46.549
I apologize sir, ma'am. I'll have this ready in a few.

00:48.842 --> 00:52.995
I apologize for the service outages this week. We've let many of you down.

00:56.362 --> 00:59.237
My apologies in advance, Rob. I'm just reading what's on the card.

01:01.062 --> 01:06.209
Yes, I am. My apologies for not writing my age on the application form.

01:09.988 --> 01:14.229
Are these your bananas? My bad! I thought they were mine.
