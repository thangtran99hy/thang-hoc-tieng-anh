How much money do you think people who are in YouTube might make?

00:05.995 --> 00:06.725
Nine dollars?

00:06.872 --> 00:08.827
If it's a really good video that lots of people like,...

00:08.977 --> 00:13.037
...they would probably get a million dollars or ten million dollars.

00:13.516 --> 00:20.795
Probably about 10,000 or 25, like, 60 grand or something.

00:21.268 --> 00:22.327
500 grand.

00:22.620 --> 00:24.021
100 million maybe?

00:24.284 --> 00:25.975
Maybe a billion.

00:26.163 --> 00:27.355
Harlem Shake.

00:27.532 --> 00:30.057
Oh yeah, I wasn't gonna say anything about it.

00:30.137 --> 00:32.985
I was just thinking about it and I don't know why I was.

00:33.093 --> 00:33.896
I was just thinking.

00:34.767 --> 00:36.185
The word's Harlem Shake.

00:36.407 --> 00:37.171
I don't know why.
