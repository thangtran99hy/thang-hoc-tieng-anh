I've always been an admirer of the Kennedy family and JFK in particular.

00:09.569 --> 00:11.343
I've always had a connection to him.

00:11.524 --> 00:13.991
And so throughout my life, I've read a lot, a lot.

00:14.060 --> 00:17.022
If there's a book about him or his presidency, I've probably read it.

00:17.569 --> 00:22.856
So when this came my way, I was honored to be asked and it's been an amazing experience.

00:26.052 --> 00:33.836
I think for known figures the key is inhabitation, not imitation.

00:34.087 --> 00:40.919
"I am today announcing my candidacy for the presidency of the United States."

00:41.267 --> 00:47.231
My goal was to play a husband, a father, a brother, a man with a big job.

00:48.070 --> 00:49.199
Responsibility is mine.

00:52.048 --> 00:53.233
I am the president.

00:54.228 --> 00:59.846
That was the stuff that I was looking to capture about him.

01:00.884 --> 01:04.575
All of that stuff, I think, you find in your research and you bring to the set...

01:04.683 --> 01:11.028
...and you try to infuse it whenever you can, and that's what makes it authentic.

01:13.921 --> 01:22.117
The goal is just to make him an honest, real man.

01:22.691 --> 01:25.162
He did things nobody ever dreamed possible...

01:25.327 --> 01:30.496
...and his ability to inspire people, we've never seen since.
