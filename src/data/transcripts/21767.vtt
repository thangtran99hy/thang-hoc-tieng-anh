Getting ready for Black Friday requires months of planning.

00:03.463 --> 00:07.088
Leadership meetings and getting every single point from where guests walk in,...

00:07.254 --> 00:09.167
...to where every single item will be in our store.

00:09.506 --> 00:12.639
And then there's tons of communication down to every single team member,...

00:12.924 --> 00:15.633
...so that when guests come in for that magical Black Friday holiday,...

00:15.927 --> 00:18.168
...it runs nice and smooth and they leave with a smile.

00:19.870 --> 00:21.718
Black Friday isn't just magical for guests.

00:21.941 --> 00:24.507
Black Friday is also magical for the team here at Target as well.

00:24.813 --> 00:28.504
In fact, one of our yearly traditions is everybody brings in a Thanksgiving recipe,...

00:28.744 --> 00:31.242
...and we all sit on Black Friday and have a family meal.

00:31.510 --> 00:34.420
That's how we celebrate our Black Friday holiday as a team here at Target.

00:35.027 --> 00:36.346
Black Friday takes a lot of prep.

00:36.619 --> 00:39.710
Prep for the store, prep for the team and of course, prep for the guests.

00:39.819 --> 00:41.907
But I can't do that without my trusted megaphone.

00:42.039 --> 00:43.527
Let's get started with the wave!

00:44.119 --> 00:47.415
One, two, three!
