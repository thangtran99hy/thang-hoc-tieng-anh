00:05.639 --> 00:09.343
Drivers know that accidents, construction, stalled vehicles...

00:09.422 --> 00:12.947
...and just the sheer number of people on the road all contribute to traffic.

00:13.343 --> 00:15.388
The real culprit, however, is speed...

00:15.700 --> 00:18.711
...or rather, sudden random fluctuations in speed.

00:19.424 --> 00:22.815
When drivers travel at a constant rate, traffic flows freely.

00:24.719 --> 00:27.847
But when even a single driver hits the brakes, the flow is interrupted,...

00:28.121 --> 00:30.777
...causing a chain reaction among the vehicles behind that driver.

00:31.565 --> 00:34.338
A traffic jam occurs when drivers brake abruptly.

00:34.567 --> 00:37.938
This causes the vehicles behind them to slow down or even come to a stop.

00:38.817 --> 00:41.615
Vehicles enter the back of the jam at a faster rate...

00:41.829 --> 00:44.610
...than the slower moving lead vehicles can accelerate out of it.

00:45.333 --> 00:49.628
The result: a traffic jam persists until the volume of incoming vehicles...

00:49.887 --> 00:52.767
...drops low enough to allow the lead vehicles to restore the flow.
