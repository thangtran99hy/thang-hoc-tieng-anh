00:00.731 --> 00:03.359
Design engineers work hard to solve problems.

00:03.703 --> 00:07.541
They often share certain characteristics which make them really good at their job.

00:08.191 --> 00:10.008
Frustration can be seen as a bad thing,...

00:10.751 --> 00:14.171
...but for design engineers, it can be the starting point for a really good idea.

00:15.545 --> 00:19.763
Identifying what frustrates you about an existing product can help you make it better.

00:20.231 --> 00:23.661
A successful and well-designed product is something that's easy to use.

00:24.145 --> 00:27.899
James Dyson's frustration with the vacuum bag encouraged him to rethink it...

00:28.045 --> 00:30.242
...and then use a cyclone design instead.

00:30.986 --> 00:33.525
Wrong thinking is allowing yourself to think differently...

00:33.847 --> 00:36.585
...and to not be afraid of trying new and crazy ideas.

00:37.471 --> 00:41.232
Keeping an open mind can lead to a solution that no one has ever thought of before.

00:41.314 --> 00:43.517
It's about thinking your way around a problem...

00:43.609 --> 00:45.899
...and seeing solutions that other people might not.

00:46.384 --> 00:50.515
To answer his brief of creating a small car that could still carry four adults,...

00:51.017 --> 00:54.209
...Alec Issigonis decided to put the engine in the opposite way round.

00:56.966 --> 00:59.353
A perfect design doesn't happen straightaway.

00:59.621 --> 01:00.719
Design is a process.

01:01.455 --> 01:04.776
When something doesn't work first time, it's about sticking with it,...

01:05.086 --> 01:08.903
...making small changes and ultimately, making your design stronger.

01:11.508 --> 01:13.477
You have to learn from things that went wrong,...

01:13.697 --> 01:15.080
...work out why they went wrong,...

01:15.175 --> 01:18.124
...and using that experience, find out how to make them better.

01:18.923 --> 01:22.371
It took Thomas Edison thousands of attempts to invent the light bulb.

01:22.656 --> 01:25.735
And now, it's still used by millions of people every day.

01:28.217 --> 01:30.780
All new designers need to have a bit of fighting spirit...

01:30.897 --> 01:33.777
...and be prepared to keep going in the face of competition.

01:34.041 --> 01:36.892
If you're designing a new product or improving someone else's,...

01:37.117 --> 01:39.912
...you have to convince people that your product is better.

01:40.445 --> 01:43.751
You'll have to explain your product clearly and talk passionately about it.

01:43.915 --> 01:45.971
Design engineers need to be determined.
