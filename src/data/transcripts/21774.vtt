The numbers of foster children in Arizona have really spiked in the last few years.

00:08.350 --> 00:13.875
And right now, there are well an excess of 13,000 children in care.

00:14.309 --> 00:20.130
Of those children, there are approximately 4,000 children freed for adoption,...

00:20.222 --> 00:21.187
...waiting for homes.

00:21.398 --> 00:26.234
National Adoption Day is a celebration of all families who adopt children,...

00:26.492 --> 00:31.163
...but there's a particular emphasis on children being adopted through the foster care system.

00:31.435 --> 00:33.888
Adoption is truly a life-changing experience.

00:34.065 --> 00:36.585
It's not only something that will change your life.

00:36.698 --> 00:39.843
It's something that will change the life of the child that you adopt.

00:40.005 --> 00:45.683
Our adoptive families often tell us what joy that these children have brought into their lives...

00:45.781 --> 00:48.583
...and you hear it all the time that they're the ones that's being changed,...

00:48.713 --> 00:50.817
...and they're the ones that's being helped through adoption.

00:51.065 --> 00:55.994
It is nothing but a positive experience for the children...

00:56.643 --> 01:01.770
...who now have forever homes where they are safe and loved and well cared for,...

01:01.907 --> 01:08.224
...and have a celebration at National Adoption Day to finalize that forever home for them.

01:08.349 --> 01:11.708
Our families that come forward and adopt foster children...

01:11.989 --> 01:14.983
...are literally giving these children a new chance at life.

01:15.175 --> 01:16.997
Even though you would think it would be the same,...

01:17.167 --> 01:19.565
...having lived there for awhile as a foster child,...

01:19.646 --> 01:22.469
...there is definitely something different about being adopted.

01:22.807 --> 01:25.863
Taking that family's last name if the child chooses to do so,...

01:25.955 --> 01:30.128
...and just really feeling, being able to say, "This is my mom. This is my dad."...

01:30.230 --> 01:32.789
...not, "This is my foster mom. This is my foster dad."

01:33.044 --> 01:35.244
There is never a dry eye in the court room...

01:35.346 --> 01:38.647
...because the adoptive parents, whatever their journey has been,...

01:38.763 --> 01:43.065
...those adoptive parents have wanted children, have wanted this child.

01:43.340 --> 01:47.997
And so, it really is kind of a celebration of the journey they've been on...

01:48.360 --> 01:52.272
...to actually finalize their adoption and provide a forever home.
