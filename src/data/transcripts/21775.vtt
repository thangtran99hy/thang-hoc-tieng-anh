Hey everyone, Trace here for DNews answering a long-held question in a lot of people's minds.

00:05.061 --> 00:07.301
What's the difference between a hurricane and a typhoon?

00:07.673 --> 00:08.549
We hear both words a lot.

00:08.779 --> 00:10.346
They're both storms that get names.

00:10.740 --> 00:15.000
The super typhoon hitting Asia right now is named Haiyan or Yolanda, by the way.

00:15.212 --> 00:17.375
The main difference between a hurricane and a typhoon,...

00:17.619 --> 00:20.223
...believe it or not, is simply where the storm occurs.

00:20.391 --> 00:23.065
According to NOAA, hurricanes form in the Northern Atlantic,...

00:23.176 --> 00:24.805
...Northeastern Pacific and South Pacific.

00:25.285 --> 00:28.629
Typhoons form in the Northwestern Pacific specifically.

00:28.923 --> 00:31.422
There are also cyclones, I forgot all about them,...

00:31.609 --> 00:35.105
...which form in the Southwest Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean.

00:35.247 --> 00:37.311
Science likes naming things and they're very thorough.

00:37.507 --> 00:40.628
Basically, there are three names for the same big spinny storms.

00:40.854 --> 00:45.003
And one cool fact, the word "hurricane" comes from the name of one of the Mayan gods,...

00:45.279 --> 00:47.603
...Huracan, who helped create the world, no big deal.

00:47.900 --> 00:51.011
Other than location, is there anything unique about each type of storm?

00:51.143 --> 00:51.571
Not really.

00:51.708 --> 00:54.664
All three storms share humble beginnings as tropical storms.

00:55.154 --> 00:59.345
Each begin over warm oceans where there are high levels of air moisture and wind.

00:59.607 --> 01:03.092
If the right conditions persist, then these spinning storms will grow.

01:03.241 --> 01:06.541
And when they reach sustained internal wind speeds of 74 miles an hour,...

01:06.889 --> 01:11.346
...they can bring torrential rain, flooding and all the other hallmarks of a big storm like that.

01:11.727 --> 01:15.395
The location of the typhoon, cyclone or hurricane determines the direction it spins.

01:15.479 --> 01:19.475
Just being a typhoon doesn't mean it will spin in a specific direction.

01:19.665 --> 01:20.453
Same with a hurricane.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.240
Storms can spin either way.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.945
All storms forming in the Northern Hemisphere spin counterclockwise,...

01:26.271 --> 01:29.074
...while those forming in the Southern Hemisphere spin clockwise.

01:29.354 --> 01:29.927
Easy peasy.
