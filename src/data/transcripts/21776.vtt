00:00.053 --> 00:00.616
Parents.

00:00.913 --> 00:01.572
Parents.

00:01.947 --> 00:03.052
Hello, parents.

00:03.258 --> 00:04.721
The holidays are upon us.

00:05.009 --> 00:06.792
And it's time for some good cheer.

00:07.177 --> 00:08.400
And some straight talk.

00:08.841 --> 00:10.654
So let's dispense with the pleasantries...

00:10.791 --> 00:11.515
...and have at it.

00:12.255 --> 00:14.901
First, don't overtape the presents.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.128
It's no fun for the person to rip up.

00:17.304 --> 00:18.971
Believe me, I've been there.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.165
Secondly,...

00:20.353 --> 00:23.259
...it's been said, "Buy a kid a gift and they'll play with the box."

00:23.473 --> 00:24.793
Well, that's a myth.

00:24.930 --> 00:27.187
And frankly, it's a little insulting.

00:27.473 --> 00:30.347
Maybe kids played with boxes in the old days.

00:30.626 --> 00:32.961
Back then, all they had to play with was a stick.

00:33.229 --> 00:33.871
Or a rock.

00:34.277 --> 00:36.101
Then maybe a box felt like a step up.

00:36.341 --> 00:37.247
Not today!

00:37.569 --> 00:38.511
No, no, no.

00:38.734 --> 00:41.632
Today I'll take a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, thank you.

00:42.168 --> 00:42.963
Thirdly,...

00:43.440 --> 00:45.621
...it's better to give than to receive.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.824
You hear that a lot this time of year.

00:48.044 --> 00:48.869
Well, you know what?

00:49.242 --> 00:50.149
We're kids.

00:50.365 --> 00:51.733
Receiving is what we do.

00:52.003 --> 00:54.120
We'd receive all day if we could.

00:55.003 --> 00:56.405
What leads me to point four...

00:57.249 --> 00:57.997
...it's three.

00:58.899 --> 00:59.629
Point four:...

00:59.989 --> 01:01.597
...regarding Christmas lists.

01:01.791 --> 01:04.510
We will be changing our minds until the morning of.

01:04.924 --> 01:06.993
So I might suggest that you overshop.

01:07.355 --> 01:08.485
An extra Barbie here,...

01:08.601 --> 01:09.948
...a razor scooter there,...

01:10.097 --> 01:11.419
...never hurt anyone.

01:11.645 --> 01:13.354
It's called damage control.

01:13.543 --> 01:16.105
'Cause no one wants a Christmas morning meltdown.

01:16.637 --> 01:17.964
Least of all us.

01:18.373 --> 01:21.258
And finally, at the end of the gift receiving,....

01:21.460 --> 01:22.298
...we will say,...

01:22.465 --> 01:23.134
"That's all?"

01:23.293 --> 01:23.919
"That's it?"

01:24.092 --> 01:25.731
"There's gotta be more, right?"

01:26.068 --> 01:27.313
"Isn't there any more gifts?"

01:28.249 --> 01:28.612
"No?"

01:29.353 --> 01:31.084
Sorry, but we will say that.

01:31.309 --> 01:32.103
We're kids.

01:32.301 --> 01:33.059
That's what kids say.

01:33.396 --> 01:35.357
It's not because we don't love what you got us.

01:35.626 --> 01:37.409
It's because we love it so much,...

01:37.588 --> 01:38.363
...we want more.

01:38.863 --> 01:39.265
Kmart.

01:39.695 --> 01:40.304
Get in.

01:40.733 --> 01:41.917
Get more Christmas.
