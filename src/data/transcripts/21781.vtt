00:04.382 --> 00:08.442
The greatest threat to loss of life during a hurricane doesn't come from the wind,...

00:08.514 --> 00:11.489
...it comes from the water that the wind pushes ashore.

00:11.725 --> 00:13.901
This is something that we call storm surge.

00:14.322 --> 00:18.089
You can think of it this way, you're standing on the beach on a bright, summer, sunny afternoon...

00:18.191 --> 00:22.010
...and you watch the tides go out and you watch the tides come in.

00:22.430 --> 00:26.792
Everyone knows that tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the sun and the moon,....

00:26.883 --> 00:29.733
...but add to the mix a powerful storm or hurricane.

00:30.246 --> 00:34.891
When a hurricane moves onshore, its strong winds push water toward the coast...

00:35.049 --> 00:40.105
...piling up water near shore and the water has nowhere to go but up and inland,...

00:40.184 --> 00:44.479
...and it's that water on top of the normal tide that we call the storm surge.

00:44.902 --> 00:49.285
A storm surge can reach as high as 20 feet and extend miles inland,...

00:49.631 --> 00:55.202
...causing devastation, devastating flooding and life-threatening storm surge up and down the coast.

00:55.855 --> 00:57.913
Now that's your Hurricane IQ.
