When sporting teams and work teams,...

00:03.065 --> 00:06.179
...have plans to improve themselves or simply have a vacancy,...

00:06.631 --> 00:10.377
...the coach or manager usually calls in a specialist to find new talents.

00:11.043 --> 00:15.337
In companies, that specialist is the HR or human resources manager.

00:15.947 --> 00:18.660
Recruiting is a huge part of making great teams.

00:19.341 --> 00:22.959
From the group of  wannabes, HR staff use their knowledge and experience...

00:23.035 --> 00:24.905
...to find the best person for the job.

00:25.272 --> 00:29.142
HR managers are a vital link in the company's overall structure,...

00:29.300 --> 00:32.061
...making sure that the people match the company's purpose.

00:32.915 --> 00:36.912
But human resources staff do much more than find stars for the team.

00:37.833 --> 00:40.030
They provide expert advice to managers...

00:40.094 --> 00:42.553
...about how they can improve their team's performance...

00:42.977 --> 00:45.981
...and suggest training options to optimize staff potential.

00:46.590 --> 00:50.199
HR staff also monitor well-being, look after safety needs...

00:50.417 --> 00:52.495
...and sometimes act as intermediaries.

00:52.968 --> 00:56.047
And importantly, they make sure people get paid fairly.

00:56.887 --> 01:00.431
They then follow up to ensure when jobs change, so does the pay.

01:01.026 --> 01:04.337
Keeping capable staff saves time and money in the long run,...

01:04.618 --> 01:07.975
...so HR managers play a big part in staff retention.

01:08.503 --> 01:13.779
In a big company, helping people along a successful career path is part of this responsibility.

01:14.759 --> 01:18.407
HR managers can make a big difference when they connect the right people.

01:19.346 --> 01:23.853
They help shape the business by facilitating change, then everyone benefits.
