It wasn't so long ago that if you wanted to share music,...

00:02.741 --> 00:05.296
...you did it with physical objects called cassettes.

00:05.434 --> 00:06.637
We call these mixtapes.

00:06.837 --> 00:10.303
And you are not going to believe how difficult it was to make one.

00:11.084 --> 00:13.225
The first thing you needed was a blank tape.

00:13.443 --> 00:16.435
A package of blank tapes was like a box of potential.

00:16.673 --> 00:22.871
The songs had to be painstakingly recorded one by one in real time.

00:23.078 --> 00:27.983
Some people would even listen to the radio all day, waiting for their song to come on...

00:28.117 --> 00:29.797
...just so they could capture it on a mixtape.

00:29.963 --> 00:32.650
If you didn't plan, you might run out of tape in the middle of a song.

00:32.935 --> 00:36.162
And then, you had to do that whole side over again.
