Many legends surround the beginnings of Christmas tree decorations.

00:04.097 --> 00:08.403
One of the most popular such legends proposes that it began with Saint Boniface,...

00:08.510 --> 00:10.469
..in Germany around the 1st century.

00:10.939 --> 00:15.145
St. Boniface happened upon a pagan ritual involving an oak tree,...

00:15.274 --> 00:17.041
...and enraged, cut it down.

00:17.835 --> 00:21.529
A miracle occurred when out of the roots rose a young fir tree.

00:21.790 --> 00:25.141
St. Boniface then believed the tree to be a gift from God...

00:25.297 --> 00:27.701
...and as such, deserving of adoration.

00:28.060 --> 00:31.557
Another purports Martin Luther is "The Father of the Christmas tree".

00:31.997 --> 00:36.155
And still others credit the Egyptians with this well-loved tradition.

00:36.671 --> 00:40.636
Regardless of origin though, it is clear that the custom has changed...

00:40.715 --> 00:42.439
...and evolved throughout  the centuries...

00:42.508 --> 00:45.635
...and become the family affair we look forward to today.
