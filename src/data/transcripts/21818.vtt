00:00.275 --> 00:01.168
My clubs are here, right?

00:01.253 --> 00:02.037
Yes, Mr. Chambers.

00:02.131 --> 00:03.229
FedEx delivered them this morning.

00:03.389 --> 00:05.039
Yeah, I thought it was okay to golf on this trip.

00:05.471 --> 00:06.019
Why wouldn't it be?

00:06.083 --> 00:08.361
Because Mr. Chambers is checking in without his clubs.

00:19.750 --> 00:20.591
Golf, Ted?

00:21.845 --> 00:25.607
Mr. Chambers and I are flabbergasted at you!

00:26.434 --> 00:28.688
Let FedEx Office pack and ship your clubs, luggage and more.

00:28.771 --> 00:30.094
FedEx, solutions that matter.
