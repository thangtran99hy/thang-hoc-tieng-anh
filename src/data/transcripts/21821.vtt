Hi, I'm Erica Clark, Food Editor for Parents Magazine.

00:05.798 --> 00:10.071
I'm gonna show you how to make adorable, edible snow globes out of chocolate sandwich cookies.

00:10.494 --> 00:15.031
All you need is a White Fudge Covered Oreo, a Grasshopper Fudge Mint Cookie,...

00:15.487 --> 00:21.041
...vanilla Candy Melts and assorted cookie icy decorations such as sprinkles and edible glitter.

00:21.530 --> 00:24.594
You can also use food-safe markers if you'd like to draw on your snow globe.

00:25.215 --> 00:29.503
Spoon on some warm Candy Melts, sprinkle the sugar to form a snowbank,...

00:29.749 --> 00:31.417
...and perch the penguin on top of it.

00:34.427 --> 00:35.969
Once you've finished decorating your Oreo,...

00:36.059 --> 00:38.301
...you can use Candy Melt to attach it to the mint cookie.

00:38.735 --> 00:41.544
The Oreo will be vertical and the cookie will be horizontal,...

00:42.077 --> 00:43.348
...so it looks like a real snow globe.

00:43.839 --> 00:46.153
And there you have it, a snack-worthy snow globe.
