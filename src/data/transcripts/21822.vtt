What is Google re-marketing?

00:02.121 --> 00:05.444
What if you could continue to promote to customers that came to your site...

00:05.757 --> 00:06.916
...but weren't ready to purchase?

00:07.286 --> 00:11.374
What if your advertisement could show up all over the internet wherever they were browsing...

00:11.723 --> 00:14.993
...including major sites like CNN, YouTube and more!

00:15.311 --> 00:18.432
The visitors you generated from advertising didn't buy anything...

00:18.871 --> 00:20.903
...and now you don't have any way of following up with them.

00:21.333 --> 00:22.641
That's not a problem anymore!

00:23.012 --> 00:25.263
Google re-marketing knows who that visitor is...

00:25.539 --> 00:28.349
...and will display your ads to them even after they leave your site.

00:29.091 --> 00:32.965
Google re-marketing knows what products and services your visitors look at on your site.

00:33.297 --> 00:38.069
After they leave, re-marketing continues to show them ads of the products or services they're interested in.

00:38.357 --> 00:41.843
So you stay in the conversation that's going on in your prospect's mind...

00:41.983 --> 00:43.440
...without having to lift a finger.

00:44.258 --> 00:45.658
How does Google re-marketing work?

00:46.536 --> 00:52.073
98% of people visiting any given website at anytime will leave the site without purchasing anything.

00:52.520 --> 00:56.293
The natural tendencies of the consumers is that they'll eventually buy something...

00:56.395 --> 00:58.043
...if they see it over and over again.

00:58.569 --> 01:02.577
This is why re-marketing is one of the most effective ways of increasing sales.

01:03.189 --> 01:07.291
Re-marketing is a new form of advertising designed to re-engage your customer.

01:07.701 --> 01:11.231
Re-marketing takes note of each and every visitor who lands on your website.

01:11.643 --> 01:14.639
It remembers the visitor and then follows them to the next website,...

01:14.747 --> 01:17.591
...and serves them with another advertisement from your company...

01:17.838 --> 01:20.899
...giving them more incentive to return to your website and purchase.
