00:03.493 --> 00:09.323
Ladies and gentlemen, the victors of the 74th Hunger Games:...

00:09.587 --> 00:12.573
...Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark.

00:19.129 --> 00:20.671
She's not who they think she is.

00:21.892 --> 00:24.642
She just wants to save her skin, simple as that.

00:25.851 --> 00:28.211
She has become a beacon of hope for them.

00:28.956 --> 00:30.157
She has to be eliminated.

00:31.192 --> 00:31.757
What do you think?

00:32.537 --> 00:36.291
I agree she should die, but in the right way, at the right time.

00:37.291 --> 00:38.919
Katniss Everdeen is a symbol.

00:39.141 --> 00:41.435
We don't have to destroy her, just her image.

00:42.091 --> 00:44.314
Show them that she is one of us now.

00:44.899 --> 00:46.369
Let them rally behind that.

00:50.519 --> 00:52.883
They're gonna hate her so much, they just might kill her for you.

00:54.854 --> 00:55.469
No!

01:00.185 --> 01:02.683
Haymitch please, please, just help me get through this trip.

01:02.899 --> 01:05.313
This trip doesn't end when you get back home.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.117
So what do we do?

01:06.268 --> 01:12.113
From now on, your job is to be a distraction so people forget what the real  problems are.

01:13.211 --> 01:15.505
Chins up, smiles on.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.189
There she is, Katniss Everdeen, the girl on fire!

01:24.266 --> 01:25.839
People are looking at you, Katniss.

01:26.061 --> 01:28.804
You've given them an opportunity, they just have to be brave enough to take it.

01:30.329 --> 01:31.271
You saved my life.

01:31.475 --> 01:32.355
You gave me a chance.

01:32.521 --> 01:33.255
Yes, to live.

01:33.495 --> 01:34.752
No, to do something.

01:36.321 --> 01:38.331
We have to go, Gale, before they kill us.

01:38.471 --> 01:39.544
They will kill us.

01:43.599 --> 01:44.007
No!

01:45.067 --> 01:45.856
No, no!

01:52.980 --> 01:53.551
Go ahead.

01:57.395 --> 02:00.751
Her entire species must be eradicated.

02:01.135 --> 02:02.200
Her species, sir?

02:02.572 --> 02:03.389
The other victors.

02:03.721 --> 02:06.015
Because of her, they all pose a threat.

02:06.495 --> 02:09.559
Because of her, they all think they're invincible.
