We started Twitter with a very simple idea.

00:04.017 --> 00:05.407
We started because we wanted to see it.

00:05.543 --> 00:06.027
We loved it,...

00:06.147 --> 00:10.193
...and we kept building it because we wanted to see other people use it.

00:10.357 --> 00:12.771
There's a series of moments, there's no one big moment.

00:12.874 --> 00:15.520
And each time is like, "Oh, that's happening?"

00:15.624 --> 00:17.967
Well, that means this other thing may happen,...

00:18.059 --> 00:20.011
...and then who knows what might happen next.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.365
We just never thought it would go this way,...

00:22.477 --> 00:26.313
...and I honestly think that's part of the reason why we succeeded.

00:26.658 --> 00:32.501
It's such a simple tool, yet people have done so many amazing things with it.

00:38.189 --> 00:41.382
You're able to have these multi-directional conversations.

00:41.567 --> 00:44.759
You're not just broadcasting, you're there in the middle of it.

00:48.633 --> 00:52.653
I'm gonna make history here as the first president to live tweet.

00:52.792 --> 00:56.611
I'm using Twitter to send pictures and thoughts from space.

00:56.769 --> 01:00.480
And every day, I really enjoy reading your tweets.

01:07.024 --> 01:09.762
There's an incredible leveling of the playing field...

01:09.869 --> 01:13.920
...that gives every voice the ability to act all around the world instantly.

01:14.065 --> 01:17.855
And that democratization of content creation and sharing...

01:18.237 --> 01:22.227
...facilitates these connections that we see every day around the world...

01:22.377 --> 01:23.892
...that we would have never seen before.

01:24.355 --> 01:29.767
The possibilities and the opportunities afforded by the platform are limitless.
