ï»¿For birds, the first priority is to safeguard their eggs.

00:09.561 --> 00:11.466
To them, their prized offspring.

00:12.217 --> 00:14.835
To other animals, they're a desirable snack.

00:21.245 --> 00:23.589
The eggs themselves are minor miracles.

00:27.247 --> 00:30.305
A microscopic egg cell is planted on a globule of yolk.

00:31.151 --> 00:34.002
Waiting for it in the egg duct are stored sperm.

00:34.403 --> 00:37.170
One of which fertilizes the egg as it passes.

00:46.136 --> 00:50.535
After several hours, it reaches the line producing section of the duct.

00:51.244 --> 00:53.915
Over 24 hours, the hard shell is built up.

00:54.665 --> 01:01.969
Finally, a pigment gland squirts out spots of color and an avocet produces her egg.
