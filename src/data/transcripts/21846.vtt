I've been here for a good few years so, I'm happy to be here.

00:30.993 --> 00:34.428
I'm happy that I get to do what I wanna do.

00:37.627 --> 00:39.395
Yeah, so I'm happy. I think it's a wonderful job.

00:44.035 --> 00:46.665
And I confess I am excited to see Mickey.

00:49.957 --> 00:53.717
I'm excited because my family is gonna come from Morocco.

00:58.329 --> 01:01.989
I'm worried about little Dilbert. He's not like other kids.

01:05.605 --> 01:09.601
Abby, I'm worried you're running around with the wrong crowd.

01:14.598 --> 01:17.015
I am very sad and very ashamed of what I've done.

01:22.960 --> 01:29.437
I was very angry! I left and I went to the restaurant.
