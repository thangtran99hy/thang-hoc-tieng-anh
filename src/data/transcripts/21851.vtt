00:01.615 --> 00:10.197
At his trial in 1964, Nelson Mandela closed his statement from the dock saying,...

00:11.416 --> 00:17.405
..."I have fought against white domination and I have fought against black domination."

00:18.729 --> 00:23.860
"I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons..."

00:24.451 --> 00:27.333
"...live together in harmony and with equal opportunities."

00:28.469 --> 00:32.055
"It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve."

00:33.525 --> 00:38.311
"But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die."

00:40.842 --> 00:44.926
And Nelson Mandela lived for that ideal and he made it real.

00:46.596 --> 00:50.237
He achieved more than could be expected of any man.

00:51.689 --> 00:52.691
Today, he has gone home.

00:53.777 --> 00:59.818
And we have lost one of the most influential, courageous, and profoundly good human beings...

00:59.944 --> 01:02.696
...that any of us will share time with on this Earth.

01:04.315 --> 01:07.614
He no longer belongs to us; he belongs to the ages.

01:10.109 --> 01:12.561
Through his fierce dignity and unbending will...

01:12.682 --> 01:15.512
...to sacrifice his own freedom for the freedom of others,...

01:16.145 --> 01:20.322
...Madiba transformed South Africa and moved all of us.

01:21.703 --> 01:27.038
His journey from a prisoner to a president embodied the promise...

01:27.131 --> 01:30.857
...that human beings and countries can change for the better.

01:32.957 --> 01:37.547
His commitment to transfer power and reconcile with those who jailed him...

01:38.218 --> 01:41.671
...set an example that all humanity should aspire to,...

01:42.428 --> 01:45.040
...whether in the lives of nations or our own personal lives.

01:46.400 --> 01:50.074
The fact that he did it all with grace and good humor,...

01:51.141 --> 01:53.478
...and an ability to acknowledge his own imperfections,...

01:53.553 --> 01:55.807
...only makes the man that much more remarkable.

01:57.445 --> 01:59.913
As he once said, "I am not a saint,..."

02:00.825 --> 02:03.849
"...unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying."

02:07.409 --> 02:11.245
I am one of the countless millions who drew inspiration from Nelson Mandela's life.

02:13.109 --> 02:15.108
My very first political action,...

02:16.879 --> 02:22.760
...the first thing I ever did that involved an issue or a policy or politics,...

02:23.495 --> 02:25.025
...was a protest against apartheid.

02:27.917 --> 02:30.175
I would study his words and his writings.

02:31.545 --> 02:36.820
The day he was released from prison gave me a sense of what human beings can do...

02:36.903 --> 02:39.239
...when they're guided by their hopes and not by their fears.

02:40.805 --> 02:42.285
And like so many around the globe,...

02:42.425 --> 02:47.432
...I cannot fully imagine my own life without the example that Nelson Mandela set,...

02:48.601 --> 02:52.651
...and so long as I live I will do what I can to learn from him.

02:54.770 --> 03:03.965
To Graca Machel and his family, Michelle and I extend our deepest sympathy and gratitude...

03:04.068 --> 03:06.257
...for sharing this extraordinary man with us.

03:07.620 --> 03:12.086
His life's work meant long days away from those who loved him most.

03:12.756 --> 03:15.765
And I only hope that the time spent with him these last few weeks...

03:16.353 --> 03:18.893
...brought peace and comfort to his family.

03:20.237 --> 03:24.913
To the people of South Africa, we draw strength from the example of renewal...

03:25.081 --> 03:28.830
...and reconciliation and resilience that you made real.

03:30.623 --> 03:34.023
A free South Africa at peace with itself.

03:35.129 --> 03:40.779
That's an example to the world and that's Madiba's legacy to the nation he loved.

03:43.550 --> 03:46.826
We will not likely see the likes of Nelson Mandela again.

03:48.573 --> 03:53.800
So it falls to us as best we can to forward the example that he set.

03:55.430 --> 03:58.210
To make decisions guided not by hate, but by love,...

03:59.473 --> 04:02.360
...to never discount the difference that one person can make,...

04:03.970 --> 04:07.529
...to strive for a future that is worthy of his sacrifice.

04:09.253 --> 04:14.441
For now, let us pause and give thanks for the fact that Nelson Mandela lived.

04:15.785 --> 04:23.281
A man who took history in his hands and bent the arc of the moral universe toward justice.
