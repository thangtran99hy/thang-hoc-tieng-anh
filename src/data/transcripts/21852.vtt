00:00.207 --> 00:12.239
I, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, do hereby swear to be faithful to the Republic of South Africa.

00:13.879 --> 00:14.979
So help me God.

00:19.021 --> 00:20.425
To many, he was a hero.

00:20.741 --> 00:23.392
A man of courage, conviction and vision.

00:23.999 --> 00:28.597
He was often called humble, charming, loyal, and a man who cared about others.

00:29.233 --> 00:34.925
Nelson Mandela was born on July 18th, 1918 and grew up in Transkei,...

00:35.237 --> 00:37.308
...a former South African black homeland.

00:38.366 --> 00:42.169
As a young man, he became active in the anti-apartheid movement...

00:42.459 --> 00:45.619
...and joined the African National Congress or ANC.

00:46.221 --> 00:50.313
And in the 1940s, became head of the ANC's youth wing.

00:51.613 --> 00:57.249
The government banned the ANC in 1960 but the group continued to operate secretly.

00:57.957 --> 01:01.049
Mr. Mandela was constantly evading the police...

01:01.413 --> 01:04.043
...and forced to live apart from his second wife, Winnie,...

01:04.459 --> 01:07.859
...who later also became active in the anti-apartheid movement.

01:08.731 --> 01:12.843
When the ANC decided stronger action must be taken to end apartheid,...

01:13.280 --> 01:16.633
...Mr. Mandela became head of the group's new military wing,...

01:17.193 --> 01:22.483
...coordinating a sabotage campaign against South African military and government targets.

01:23.243 --> 01:29.462
In 1962, Mr. Mandela was arrested and put on trial for his actions against the government.

01:30.087 --> 01:35.218
He defended his actions as part of the struggle of the African people for a free society.

01:35.952 --> 01:41.539
Two years later, he was sentenced to life in prison on Robben Island off the coast of Cape Town.

01:42.125 --> 01:48.785
He spent 18 years in the notorious prison, refusing a government offer in 1989 to release him...

01:49.258 --> 01:51.815
...if he would renounce the ANC's armed struggle.

01:52.621 --> 01:58.447
But he finally was freed in 1990 after the white government, led by President Frederick de Klerk,...

01:59.017 --> 02:03.562
...legalized all political parties and discharged most political prisoners.

02:04.309 --> 02:10.019
In 1991, Mr. Mandela was elected president of the African National Congress.

02:10.731 --> 02:16.395
And in 1994, when the ANC won South Africa's first all-race elections,...

02:16.883 --> 02:21.177
...he became the country's first black president at the age of 75.

02:21.825 --> 02:31.282
Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land...

02:31.983 --> 02:36.919
...will again experience the oppression of one by another.

02:37.711 --> 02:41.039
President Mandela said he would stay for only one term.

02:41.355 --> 02:44.801
Cohen says during Mr. Mandela's five years as president,...

02:45.288 --> 02:49.837
...he earned international respect for South Africa's national reconciliation.

02:50.574 --> 02:53.960
Mr. Mandela received hundreds of awards during his lifetime...

02:54.400 --> 03:00.526
...and he shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 with his once bitter enemy, Mr. de Klerk.

03:01.126 --> 03:05.037
They were honored for their contribution to the peace process in South Africa.

03:05.647 --> 03:08.249
Mr. Mandela praised the South African people.

03:08.605 --> 03:15.777
We will have created a society which recognizes that all people are born equal.

03:16.764 --> 03:23.273
In 1999 at the age of 85, Nelson Mandela said he was retiring from public life...

03:23.488 --> 03:26.517
...but he continued his work fighting for children's rights.

03:27.048 --> 03:33.543
In a country torn apart by years of racial conflict, Nelson Mandela is considered a remarkable leader.

03:34.041 --> 03:37.278
A man who turned South Africa away from violence and hatred,...

03:37.743 --> 03:40.443
...into a country of greater peace and understanding.

03:41.258 --> 03:42.745
