Christmas time.

00:02.825 --> 00:06.833
The trees, colorful decorations, the carols, such a festive season.

00:07.093 --> 00:09.505
And let's not forget every parent's favorite part:...

00:09.867 --> 00:11.404
...taking the kids to see Santa Claus.

00:15.046 --> 00:16.161
Happens to a lot of kids.

00:16.219 --> 00:19.562
Suzy's kids were okay this year but she definitely remembers last year.

00:19.684 --> 00:20.536
It was a very bad photo.

00:20.956 --> 00:23.661
So, some people say that those are some of the cutest photos, you wouldn't agree?

00:23.749 --> 00:26.986
It was cute but, yeah, he's sad and crying in it.

00:27.363 --> 00:29.365
Pause. See the smirk on her face?

00:30.195 --> 00:32.933
I told you, the parents love it; the kiddies, not so much.

00:32.995 --> 00:36.039
Just have a quick browse online and you'll find all kinds of photos and videos...

00:36.123 --> 00:38.651
...of kids freaking out when they meet jolly old Saint Nick.

00:38.893 --> 00:40.681
Occasionally you'll get the ones that are really frightened,...

00:40.802 --> 00:42.424
...usually around the ages of two.

00:42.875 --> 00:46.946
They're just not comfortable with Santa so they just start crying, screaming sometimes.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.168
Whether it's the beard, the big costume, the pressure of meeting a star,...

00:50.487 --> 00:53.024
...even your local mall Santa can set some kids off.

00:53.552 --> 00:57.593
She was scared, terrified, screamed the whole time, reaching out for me.

00:58.049 --> 01:01.841
She was acting like she just saw a rock star and was like, in awe.

01:02.040 --> 01:04.692
Every good photographer has their own tricks to calm kids down.

01:04.951 --> 01:07.459
We come in with some bells and some puppets, stuffed toys,...

01:07.537 --> 01:09.157
...and trying giving them some noises.

01:09.281 --> 01:11.162
And parents always try to pitch in on the effort.

01:11.296 --> 01:14.199
We sat on either side of Santa and then Dean sat on my knee,...

01:14.644 --> 01:16.744
....and I think that was easier with mommy there.

01:17.174 --> 01:18.621
So, mommy and daddy there.

01:19.073 --> 01:20.974
Just let the mother take charge.

01:22.453 --> 01:25.898
I gotta ask you, there's a lot of kids who are afraid to come sit on your lap.

01:26.111 --> 01:26.715
Why is that?

01:27.540 --> 01:30.136
I don't know really, because when they see me,...

01:30.622 --> 01:32.960
...they're out there and they're laughing and waving to me...

01:33.027 --> 01:34.769
...and when they come up to me, they're frightened.

01:34.957 --> 01:36.539
Sometimes I think it's just the lower age.

01:36.649 --> 01:38.930
Santa wants all the kids to know there's nothing to fear...

01:39.204 --> 01:40.751
...except the lump of coal if you've been bad.

01:41.125 --> 01:43.008
Don't be afraid, I'm pretty gentle.

01:43.323 --> 01:45.001
Now to work on that Easter bunny phobia.

01:45.915 --> 01:47.531
