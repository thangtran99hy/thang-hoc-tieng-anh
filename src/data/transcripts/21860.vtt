ï»¿Our mission is to make the world more open and connected...

00:09.425 --> 00:11.756
...and the people who work at Facebook really believe that.

00:15.035 --> 00:18.325
I'm really proud for Facebook to be number one...

00:18.424 --> 00:20.761
...on the list of great places to work on Glassdoor.

00:23.540 --> 00:29.147
I am constantly inspired by the people I work with every day...

00:29.267 --> 00:34.447
...and the caliber of talent all concentrated in one place brings on this infectious energy.

00:38.318 --> 00:43.142
I see people that are focused on a goal, are committed and will not stop for anything.

00:43.374 --> 00:45.793
The passion that they bring to the company and the energy,...

00:46.225 --> 00:47.997
...it's one of the things I love the most about working here.

00:48.632 --> 00:51.859
The common theme that I've always seen through the whole time is just...

00:51.998 --> 00:56.120
...us being really focused on our mission to make the world more open and connected...

00:56.547 --> 00:58.827
...and to really make an impact with our product.

00:59.219 --> 01:01.387
And that's something that you know will always be a...

01:01.670 --> 01:06.308
...like a core part of our culture and just our thumbprint as a company.

01:07.413 --> 01:09.452
Knowing that you can put out a feature today...

01:09.554 --> 01:12.436
...and that it will be in front of a billion people next week...

01:12.579 --> 01:15.689
...is just something that is really hard to find in the industry...

01:15.779 --> 01:20.316
...and something that I'm happy to take advantage of every day I come to work.
