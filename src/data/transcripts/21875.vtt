ï»¿I think there's two main things that teachers are responsible for,...

00:08.080 --> 00:10.940
...one of those things is obviously getting the material across to your students.

00:11.061 --> 00:15.389
I think the second thing that's just as important is helping these students...

00:15.687 --> 00:17.663
...and these kids grow up to be young adults.

00:18.302 --> 00:20.531
Teaching them those life skills and those life lessons.

00:20.618 --> 00:25.139
The role of a teacher in a student's life is actually get them to be problem solvers.

00:25.213 --> 00:29.131
I think the content is important but I think they need to learn how to solve problems.

00:29.355 --> 00:30.201
History's a story.

00:30.833 --> 00:35.987
And if you can get them hooked on the story and how all the pieces and puzzle parts fit together...

00:36.371 --> 00:37.725
...then they're gonna be interested in it.

00:37.825 --> 00:42.057
My favorite teachers are great at making the content in class relatable...

00:42.143 --> 00:44.733
...and making it applicable to the real world.

00:44.978 --> 00:48.078
A secret weapon that I use is to use hands-on activities...

00:48.739 --> 00:53.908
...to get the students engaged by actually being a part of the lesson and taking ownership to it.

00:54.161 --> 00:57.295
A great teacher interacts with the students.

00:57.411 --> 01:03.047
I think the role of a teacher in a student's life is to inspire them to be a lifelong learner.

01:03.301 --> 01:04.919
I can teach you the strategies of reading the book.

01:05.004 --> 01:06.832
I can teach you the strategies of how to write.

01:07.111 --> 01:10.366
I can teach the problem solving strategies of tackling multiple choice questions...

01:10.445 --> 01:12.300
...but ultimately you're the one doing it.

01:12.579 --> 01:17.313
I think one thing that is crucial is developing relationships with your students.

01:17.675 --> 01:21.785
That they can rely on you when they have an issue with material,...

01:21.851 --> 01:24.203
...or when they have an issue at home or when they have an issue whatever.

01:24.339 --> 01:26.816
I think the relationship that you build with your students is very important.

01:26.921 --> 01:31.813
I think it's the most key in really kind of getting them to be comfortable in taking those risks.

01:32.320 --> 01:34.710
You have to take an interest in your students...

01:35.551 --> 01:38.245
...and what their lives are like, and what their interests are.

01:38.436 --> 01:42.557
From when the school day ends until when they come back into your room the next day.

01:42.741 --> 01:44.024
The great teachers are the ones...

01:44.149 --> 01:49.496
...who are engaged in their job and their students' lives 24 hours a day.

01:49.746 --> 01:54.201
Knowing your students, respecting them, knowing that they have lives outside of school,...

01:54.339 --> 01:57.993
...trying to learn a little bit about that and also just setting those goals high...

01:58.303 --> 01:59.334
...and helping them to meet them.

01:59.571 --> 02:03.796
More than just the cognitive piece of that child,...

02:03.899 --> 02:07.107
...I want to know them socially, emotionally and academically.

02:07.341 --> 02:08.816
To really know them and to be present...

02:08.975 --> 02:12.725
...and to challenge them to do a little bit more than they think they can do.

02:12.946 --> 02:15.302
The great teacher I think makes connections with people...

02:15.721 --> 02:18.557
...and realizes that it's not the subject matter at all but that we're all learners.
