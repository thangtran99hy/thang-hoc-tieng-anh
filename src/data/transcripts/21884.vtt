What does it mean to be a hero?

00:09.007 --> 00:13.090
It's more than just super powers and costumes.

00:14.422 --> 00:18.537
It's being scared but standing tall anyway.

00:20.573 --> 00:27.549
It's digging deeper and pushing further, than you ever thought you could.

00:30.983 --> 00:33.746
In the face of unthinkable evil,...

00:35.145 --> 00:40.232
...true heroes band together to do what's right.

00:43.973 --> 00:44.739
Oh dear!

01:01.297 --> 01:08.349
Sometimes it takes extraordinary circumstances to prove that maybe,...

01:09.071 --> 01:13.923
...just maybe, there's a hero in all of us.

01:14.066 --> 01:15.839
Gentlemen, the situation is dire.

01:16.843 --> 01:18.369
I welcome any ideas.

01:20.185 --> 01:21.541
Maybe the bad guys can help.
