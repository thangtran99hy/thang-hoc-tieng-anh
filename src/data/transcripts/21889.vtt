So peppermint is a flavor that's big during the holidays, pretty much every year.

00:05.573 --> 00:07.652
We're creating a bigger statement with it this year.

00:07.714 --> 00:11.915
It kind of cues the season so we're hoping it will get the guest excited about the holidays.

00:12.205 --> 00:16.422
And one thing about peppermint that really has going for is its great color and great shape.

00:16.529 --> 00:18.793
It can be pink, it can be fun red tones.

00:18.989 --> 00:21.543
Even when it's white, it's really sort of wintery and neat.

00:22.129 --> 00:23.971
And then it also brings a lot of texture I feel...

00:24.073 --> 00:27.354
...like when you do some crumbling of the candies like on the cookies here.

00:27.763 --> 00:29.787
To me, that really is a feast for the eyes...

00:29.869 --> 00:32.757
...which I think is a part of the reason peppermint is just bigger than ever.
