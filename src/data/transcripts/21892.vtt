00:02.271 --> 00:06.933
This building in Hamburg, Germany, is entirely powered by algae.

00:08.071 --> 00:10.847
Inside these glass panels is a green liquid...

00:11.115 --> 00:14.157
...in which you can see the bubbles rising to the surface.

00:15.167 --> 00:18.903
This is the result of having a bioreactor built into the facade,...

00:19.216 --> 00:21.555
...which heats the 15 flats in the building.

00:22.419 --> 00:27.655
The motor is microalgae, and the principle is photosynthesis.

00:34.059 --> 00:37.850
Heat is produced here in this facade by the bioreactors,...

00:38.453 --> 00:41.806
...then it is stored here before being redistributed.

00:43.656 --> 00:48.819
The heat is used to power the central systems supplying heating and hot water.

00:50.958 --> 00:53.665
The building, therefore, effectively heats itself.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.506
Laura is one of the people who live here.

00:57.281 --> 01:01.077
Her balcony looks like an aquarium with all the algae growing there.

01:01.585 --> 01:04.890
Also, this passive construction means that the building...

01:04.984 --> 01:08.220
...maintains a comfortable interior temperature without heating.
