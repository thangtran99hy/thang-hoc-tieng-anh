00:02.747 --> 00:04.061
I just don't get it.

00:04.374 --> 00:07.474
Yesterday, he picked me twice in Duck Duck Goose.

00:07.734 --> 00:10.767
Today, when we were coloring he wouldn't even look at me.

00:11.419 --> 00:16.096
Maggie, you are a beautiful, strong-willed, independent girl...

00:16.466 --> 00:19.261
...and if Johnny doesn't see that, it's his loss.

00:19.395 --> 00:22.559
And he told Dick Rafferty that I have cooties.

00:22.717 --> 00:24.704
Why would he say that I have cooties?

00:25.054 --> 00:26.951
You can't read so much into that Maggie.

00:27.126 --> 00:30.555
Michael said that I had cooties for like all of kindergarten...

00:30.681 --> 00:33.888
...and now we're crazy happy. We're going on three weeks now.

00:33.956 --> 00:36.977
I just want what you guys have. I want a Tommy in my life.

00:37.430 --> 00:38.509
Oh, no you don't.

00:38.695 --> 00:44.975
I mean, sometimes yeah, it's great but with Tommy it's like I give and I give and I give.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.957
And all he does is take.

00:47.184 --> 00:48.549
I think I'm in the friend zone.

00:48.895 --> 00:49.899
What makes you say that?

00:50.009 --> 00:54.033
Well, yesterday at lunch he asked, "Do you wanna be friends?"

00:54.369 --> 00:59.575
Oh yeah! If he asked you if you wanna be friends, you're in the friend zone.

00:59.763 --> 01:00.921
You just gotta be direct.

01:01.176 --> 01:05.636
When Michael started acting all weird, I was like, "Listen, either we're a thing or we're not a thing."

01:05.736 --> 01:09.789
It was the same way with Tommy, he's like, "I'm not ready for a relationship."

01:10.200 --> 01:12.133
And I'm like, "If not now, when?"

01:12.423 --> 01:13.875
We are not getting any younger.

01:14.089 --> 01:15.144
I hear you girl.
