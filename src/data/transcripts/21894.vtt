ï»¿Hi, I'm Sally and I'm going to give you some tips...

00:07.095 --> 00:09.393
...on how to make the perfect meringue this Christmas.

00:09.787 --> 00:13.711
First of all, you have to have a very clean bowl, and into it, egg whites.

00:14.172 --> 00:19.498
Now, I always crack my eggs like this and then separate them through my hand.

00:20.070 --> 00:22.466
Much, much less risk of breaking the yolk.

00:22.550 --> 00:24.693
Now I'm going to start adding the caster sugar.

00:25.225 --> 00:27.358
Just want to add very little at a time.

00:28.229 --> 00:32.493
Sprinkle in some sugar and then whisk it in.

00:40.378 --> 00:41.847
Look how glossy that is.

00:42.103 --> 00:43.633
Really, really thick.

00:43.867 --> 00:50.121
Now, my tip for knowing when you've really got that sugar mixed in it is just to feel it,...

00:50.546 --> 00:54.132
...and if it isn't grainy anymore, you know you've whisked it perfectly.

00:54.511 --> 00:56.179
That's gonna make great meringue.
