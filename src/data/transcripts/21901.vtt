I'm sure he'll be fantastic and above all else,...

00:07.119 --> 00:12.334
...and as a filmmaker, he's got his own style.

00:12.922 --> 00:14.092
He's not copying anyone else.

00:14.645 --> 00:17.223
And he's also sort of being tenacious in his career.

00:17.356 --> 00:21.182
He's had ups followed by downs and now, he's very up again.

00:21.256 --> 00:26.905
And I think that requires and shows a very special strength of character.

00:27.421 --> 00:30.688
And it's something which I enjoy working with because...

00:30.994 --> 00:32.598
...jobs like this requires strength of character.

00:32.675 --> 00:37.487
They require a dedication to the work and the belief in oneself...

00:37.797 --> 00:40.225
...and Ben has that clearly.
