ï»¿So you're dating, I assume you're dating.

00:02.289 --> 00:03.226
I don't know if you're in a relationship.

00:03.511 --> 00:07.961
But there's got to be a difference between English guys and American guys, right?

00:09.641 --> 00:13.697
Yeah, there's definitely one or two differences that I've noticed.

00:14.983 --> 00:18.644
English guys are very well put together and they dress really well...

00:18.711 --> 00:20.155
...and they're very well-mannered.

00:22.682 --> 00:29.122
But they're also very restrained usually in the whole courting situation.

00:29.221 --> 00:33.217
I'm used to being first of all, ignored for like the first two months of the ritual.

00:34.233 --> 00:36.401
And then, maybe they'll acknowledge my presence.

00:36.468 --> 00:40.007
And then, they'll probably be a little mean to me and then, maybe well, whatever.

00:40.384 --> 00:41.541
And then, I arrive in America!

00:41.975 --> 00:45.696
I remember few nights into Brown, this guy's just being like,...

00:46.483 --> 00:48.927
..."I like you, you're great. Let's go out on a date; let's do it."...

00:48.999 --> 00:51.547
...and I'm like, "I'm sorry, what just happened?"

00:53.168 --> 00:55.626
This is a huge culture shock for me,...

00:55.757 --> 00:59.566
...it's that they're very open and very straightforward.

00:59.840 --> 01:00.840
But they wear flip-flops...

01:00.919 --> 01:01.823
...so I don't know if I like that.

01:05.948 --> 01:06.773
You gotta figure it out.

01:07.010 --> 01:07.307
It's hard.
