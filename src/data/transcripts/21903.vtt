00:14.175 --> 00:15.375
Hello there!

00:15.867 --> 00:17.679
Is that, is that Cohen?

00:19.485 --> 00:21.691
What are you looking for Christmas this year, Cohen?

00:23.312 --> 00:24.600
A choo-choo train?

00:25.822 --> 00:28.827
And what would Mommy and Daddy like for Christmas?

00:28.913 --> 00:29.599
A big TV.

00:29.864 --> 00:32.250
What I need is new socks and underwear.

00:32.867 --> 00:34.367
An Android tablet.

00:37.694 --> 00:41.451
While the guests told their Christmas wishes to good old Saint Nick,...

00:41.727 --> 00:45.255
...WestJetters took notes and got ready to shop quick.

00:45.613 --> 00:49.090
It was a great rush, with the two flights in the air,...

00:49.347 --> 00:52.622
...to get all those presents, not a moment to spare!

01:02.348 --> 01:03.668
Thanks for flying with us at WestJet.

01:03.986 --> 01:06.195
Sit back, relax and enjoy the rest of your flight.

01:11.777 --> 01:13.353
But was everything ready?

01:13.530 --> 01:19.200
We all had to wait for the moment of truth at carousel eight.

01:26.991 --> 01:28.886
Merry Christmas!

01:50.007 --> 01:50.916
No way!

01:53.460 --> 01:58.905
The guests never expected what they asked of Saint Nick would actually appear.

01:59.287 --> 02:00.881
It was all quite a trick.

02:01.899 --> 02:05.083
A WestJetter would say, "It was more than mere fun."

02:05.420 --> 02:09.541
"Miracles do happen when we all work as one."

02:10.395 --> 02:14.313
We'll give Santa the last word on this most special night.

02:14.947 --> 02:19.271
Merry Christmas to all and to all a good flight!
