Time chose Pope Francis this year it said...

00:26.309 --> 00:32.407

00:57.769 --> 01:01.323
...and speaks effectively in favor of peace and greater justice.

01:02.138 --> 01:05.844

01:10.658 --> 01:14.085

01:14.436 --> 01:17.139

01:23.726 --> 01:28.386
...if the magazine's decision means that many have understood this message of hope.
