00:00.040 --> 00:06.970
The winner of the $75,000, 2012 Gordon E. Moore Award,...

00:07.547 --> 00:09.395
...in the category of medicine and health sciences.

00:13.515 --> 00:15.961
Congratulations, Jack Thomas Andraka.

00:20.540 --> 00:22.173
"Maybe if we'd caught it earlier."

00:24.050 --> 00:27.481
That's what the doctors said about my uncle's pancreatic cancer.

00:30.009 --> 00:32.569
Like that was even possible with the testing they had.

00:36.761 --> 00:37.537
But what did I know.

00:38.833 --> 00:42.851
I was too young to understand things like cancer or how to test for it,...

00:45.504 --> 00:47.299
...too young to be taken seriously.

00:51.658 --> 00:55.049
One hundred and ninety-nine experts told me I was too young,...

00:55.917 --> 00:58.797
...that they didn't have time for my little science fair project.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.483
But the way I saw it,...

01:03.117 --> 01:08.375
...if the key was early detection, maybe someone just needed to start looking earlier,...

01:11.189 --> 01:13.339
...like during fifth period freshman biology.
