Four-year-old Gavin isn't taking any chances.

00:03.068 --> 00:06.261
He's going straight to Santa with his list of Christmas wishes.

00:06.559 --> 00:08.159
Yes, lots of toys.

00:08.759 --> 00:10.701
You want lots of toys from Santa?

00:11.354 --> 00:14.091
It's the time of year when Santa gets lots of letters.

00:14.343 --> 00:16.115
This year, there's been some confusion...

00:16.187 --> 00:19.739
...about whether a stamp is needed to send a letter to the North Pole.

00:19.904 --> 00:23.071
You don't have to put a stamp on it, if you're sending a letter to Santa,...

00:23.325 --> 00:25.839
...it'll still be sent to the North Pole.

00:25.974 --> 00:28.897
We are prepared and ready for the letters for Santa.

00:28.999 --> 00:29.932
He's waiting for them.

00:30.069 --> 00:32.579
And we've been helping him do that for 30 years.

00:32.756 --> 00:38.131
Writing letters to Santa is a tradition that predates Canada Post, dating back 200 years.

00:38.332 --> 00:44.245
In England for instance, for a long time young children would burn the letters in a fireplace,...

00:44.323 --> 00:46.777
...thinking that somehow, through some kind of magic,...

00:46.894 --> 00:50.689
...the smoke from the embers would send their wishes to Santa.

00:50.848 --> 00:53.870
Now, mailing a letter isn't the only way to reach Santa.

00:54.009 --> 00:55.951
Turns out he's pretty high-tech.

00:56.285 --> 01:01.185
At emailsanta.com, you can send your Christmas list in an instant with the click of a button.

01:01.464 --> 01:05.254
As for reaching Santa these days, of course there's an app for that.

01:05.521 --> 01:06.791
If kids live in a digital age,...

01:06.890 --> 01:10.031
...it just makes sense to reach them where they're already playing.

01:10.130 --> 01:13.522
And I think an app is always gonna be very easy to use.

01:13.595 --> 01:16.617
Brooklyn's mom says it's not hard to imagine for her little one.

01:16.828 --> 01:19.035
I'm sure she would be in a few years,...

01:19.321 --> 01:22.409
...rather than writing a letter, she'd be typing, right?

01:23.713 --> 01:28.743
But whether it's on paper or online, Santa says he reads all of his mail.

01:28.886 --> 01:30.530
We have a big bag of mail every night...

01:30.636 --> 01:34.795
...and the computer is just full of all these letters and everything.

01:34.913 --> 01:36.172
You must be very busy.

01:36.264 --> 01:36.715
Oh, I am.

01:36.817 --> 01:38.202
I'm very busy all the time.

01:38.373 --> 01:40.171
