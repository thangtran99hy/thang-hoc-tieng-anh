00:00.281 --> 00:02.178
Is it fresh or is it fake?

00:02.491 --> 00:03.515
Tough to tell right?

00:04.099 --> 00:06.411
Artificial trees aren't what they used to be.

00:06.530 --> 00:09.039
They're more realistic and they're easier to set up.

00:09.227 --> 00:10.329
Well, before you buy,...

00:10.422 --> 00:13.716
...here are some things to think about when you choose your artificial tree.

00:15.831 --> 00:17.040
The material matters.

00:18.049 --> 00:19.888
You can choose shredded PVC,...

00:20.113 --> 00:23.185
...which used to be the main material used for artificial trees.

00:23.703 --> 00:27.555
Not very realistic-looking, but it is easy on the budget.

00:28.391 --> 00:31.299
Or you can choose PE or polyethylene.

00:31.505 --> 00:34.346
PE can be molded to look more like a real tree.

00:34.754 --> 00:38.535
It gives the branches and needles more substance and they're more pliable.

00:38.863 --> 00:43.102
Finally, the choice of material influences the time it takes to set up the tree.

00:44.952 --> 00:48.333
Trees made from shredded PVC do need some shaping,...

00:48.642 --> 00:52.494
...while trees made from PE are basically ready to go right out of the box.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.793
Wanna save even more time?

00:56.022 --> 00:59.913
Choose a pre-lit tree so you can just pop it together and plug it in.

01:00.895 --> 01:03.206
Remember to shop with some measurements in hand.

01:03.772 --> 01:06.595
You need to know the height of the space where you'll place the tree...

01:06.706 --> 01:08.085
...and available width too.

01:08.368 --> 01:11.119
And don't forget to account for a tree topper when you're measuring.
