00:00.127 --> 00:01.900
Do you know what is a heart attack?

00:02.041 --> 00:03.299
Let us understand it.

00:03.381 --> 00:06.472
Heart attack means "when a heart stops working".

00:06.752 --> 00:07.915
How does it happen?

00:08.055 --> 00:08.757
Let's see.

00:09.067 --> 00:13.931
Sometimes, inside arteries, some sticky things get stuck to the walls,...

00:14.064 --> 00:15.946
...and the way becomes blocked.

00:16.374 --> 00:21.160
It's like a road where if there is some blockage, cars start coming back.

00:21.359 --> 00:22.163
You are right!

00:22.315 --> 00:24.234
When blood can't move further,...

00:24.334 --> 00:26.759
...it starts coming back into the heart.

00:26.860 --> 00:30.572
Also, the whole circulation of the blood stops.

00:30.865 --> 00:33.931
So if the circulatory system does not work,...

00:34.011 --> 00:36.159
...the heart can't get fresh oxygen.

00:36.446 --> 00:37.809
You're a genius boy!

00:37.892 --> 00:38.583
You are right!

00:38.751 --> 00:44.309
When the circulatory system stops working, the heart can't get fresh oxygen.

00:44.746 --> 00:49.390
And without fresh oxygen, it slowly, slowly dies.

00:49.768 --> 00:52.819
Yes, sometimes it does not die fully.

00:53.008 --> 00:55.473
Some part of it becomes inactive.

00:55.811 --> 00:57.581
So when blood flow is restored,...

00:57.713 --> 01:01.047
...the heart again gets oxygen and it again starts working.

01:01.154 --> 01:01.844
You are right.

01:02.042 --> 01:05.974
If blood circulation starts again, heart starts working again,...

01:06.085 --> 01:07.827
...but it has become weak.

01:07.897 --> 01:10.760
Yes, so you need to take some extra care.

01:10.931 --> 01:13.441
So it does not get attacked again.
