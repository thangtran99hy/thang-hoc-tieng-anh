They always say there is that moment...

00:06.333 --> 00:09.599
...when you know you're doing what you're supposed to be doing because it's fun.

00:09.794 --> 00:11.021
I wasn't gonna be a teacher.

00:11.104 --> 00:13.250
I was gonna go into business and do all those sorts of things,...

00:13.325 --> 00:15.697
...and I took a history class at James Madison University...

00:16.180 --> 00:18.289
...and I had a professor who inspired me to be a teacher.

00:18.501 --> 00:21.125
Having a teacher who is passionate about her research...

00:21.442 --> 00:24.732
...and her work made me realize that's really what I wanted to do.

00:24.811 --> 00:29.345
The person that made me want to become a teacher was my seventh grade French teacher.

00:29.477 --> 00:34.185
She was very energetic and always came into our class and had just this spark about her...

00:34.260 --> 00:37.362
...that made me want to have the same spark with working with kids.

00:37.496 --> 00:40.487
Two separate teachers inspired me to become a science teacher.

00:40.762 --> 00:45.357
They really geared it to a college level class, and I just found that very engaging.

00:45.445 --> 00:47.077
I think as I matured a little bit,...

00:47.169 --> 00:50.737
...and started to understand what it meant to really be passionate about your work...

00:50.822 --> 00:52.119
...and not just get a paycheck.

00:52.206 --> 00:56.041
To see the change in them, the growth in their thinking,...

00:56.129 --> 01:00.759
...the development in their ability to have conversations and to think deeply...

01:01.289 --> 01:04.206
...has relit the fire that I have as a teacher.

01:04.315 --> 01:07.727
To see that they think back at something that we've done in class...

01:07.805 --> 01:10.851
...has really inspired them to go on to do some kind of career or something.

01:11.035 --> 01:13.154
I think that's a powerful connection I don't think you have...

01:13.233 --> 01:15.815
...if you're a lawyer or a doctor or something like that,...

01:15.897 --> 01:17.258
...and I think it makes the career worth it.
