00:18.953 --> 00:22.570
The peace between our houses will be sealed when my heir,...

00:22.647 --> 00:26.149
...Prince Iphicles, will take the Princess of Crete to be his wife.

00:34.166 --> 00:36.847
My mother once gave this as a parting gift to my father.

00:37.133 --> 00:38.351
I want you to have it.

00:41.014 --> 00:43.805
I understand you're having some trouble with the arrangements we've made.

00:44.768 --> 00:46.443
You sail to Egypt tomorrow.

00:47.675 --> 00:50.925
I wish you endless victories in the battlefield, brother.

00:52.433 --> 00:55.911
Because if you return here, I will kill you.

01:01.556 --> 01:03.327
I paid good money for you.

01:03.945 --> 01:05.773
I expect a return.

01:07.677 --> 01:12.690
I give you Hercules!

01:19.906 --> 01:25.261
I will not stop until I've returned the princess and avenged my loyal friends.

01:26.721 --> 01:29.117
Hercules, you are the son of Zeus.

01:29.344 --> 01:34.158
Embrace your father and you will discover powers that you've never imagined.

01:41.511 --> 01:44.903
Tonight, we fight for our lives!

01:49.421 --> 01:51.734
How will you offer these people their salvation...

01:51.863 --> 01:53.565
...when you cannot even save yourself?

01:54.869 --> 01:57.493
Where is your strength now, half god?
