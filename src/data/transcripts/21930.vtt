00:00.819 --> 00:02.607
Check out the "Play the Road" app...

00:02.808 --> 00:07.040
...created by Volkswagen and British electronic music legends "Underworld."

00:07.179 --> 00:11.255
This app turns cars into your own personal DJ on wheels.

00:11.379 --> 00:14.177
It makes music directly to the beat of your drive.

00:14.461 --> 00:17.375
Accelerate and you might hear some fast-moving drums.

00:18.932 --> 00:22.319
Make a sharp turn and maybe you'll hear cascading scales.

00:27.705 --> 00:30.801
The app uses data from the car's on-board computer...

00:30.947 --> 00:34.176
...and even uses GPS to play specific sounds.

00:34.433 --> 00:36.488
Drive through the countryside, for example,...

00:36.637 --> 00:39.064
...and you'll hear birds in your personal soundtrack.

00:41.349 --> 00:44.581
You'll have to wait a while before becoming your very own composer.

00:44.939 --> 00:47.382
VDubs is worried about safety implications,...

00:47.493 --> 00:50.168
...so it's not yet available for commercial use.

00:50.401 --> 00:53.818
Still, it gives a whole new meaning to "pedal to the metal."
