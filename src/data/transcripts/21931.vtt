For people living in hurricane or tornado country,...

00:03.727 --> 00:07.091
...a simple weather app does little good in the event of a major storm.

00:07.465 --> 00:10.601
A good extreme weather app to start with is Radar Cast Pro,...

00:10.679 --> 00:12.904
...two dollars in the app store for iPhones only.

00:13.182 --> 00:15.919
The app gives you the option of checking maps and satellites.

00:16.044 --> 00:20.261
Users also appreciate how the app will forecast the weather patterns an hour out.

00:20.695 --> 00:23.733
For more serious storm watchers, try downloading Radar Scope.

00:24.102 --> 00:26.508
This ten-dollar app works on both iPhones and Androids...

00:26.583 --> 00:29.947
...and gives you the most precise and accurate storm data available.

00:30.192 --> 00:32.769
Handy color codes are used to indicate thunderstorm warnings,...

00:32.851 --> 00:35.009
...tornadoes and flash flood warnings.

00:35.545 --> 00:39.819
Finally, Radar Alive is a great app for people seriously interested in tracking storms...

00:39.913 --> 00:41.307
...versus preparing for them.

00:41.604 --> 00:43.793
It costs five bucks and runs only on Androids...

00:43.890 --> 00:46.969
...and even offers a tool for actual weather chasers.

00:47.359 --> 00:50.324
I hope these apps can keep you better prepared this hurricane season.
