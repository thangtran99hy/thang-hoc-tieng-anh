Mysteries of Vernacular.

00:09.025 --> 00:12.855
Odd: different from what is usual or expected.

00:13.720 --> 00:18.154
Though the modern word "odd" has many meanings, mathematical and not,...

00:18.765 --> 00:25.503
...they can all be traced back to the Indo-European root "uzdho," meaning "pointing upwards."

00:26.792 --> 00:30.058
Inspired by the idea of a vertical pointed object,...

00:30.535 --> 00:35.722
...speakers of Old Norse modified this root into a new word, "oddi,"...

00:36.314 --> 00:42.549
...which was used to refer to a triangle, the simplest pointed object, geometrically speaking.

00:43.450 --> 00:49.573
A triangle with a long point, like an arrowhead or a piece of land jutting out into the sea,...

00:50.320 --> 00:55.247
...was recognized to have two paired angles and a third that stood alone.

00:56.393 --> 01:01.737
And over time, "oddi" began to refer to something that wasn't matched or paired.

01:02.775 --> 01:08.142
In Old Norse, "oddi" also came to mean any number indivisible by two.

01:08.672 --> 01:14.375
And "odda mathr," the "odd man," was used to describe the unpaired man...

01:14.466 --> 01:16.229
...whose vote could break a tie.

01:17.730 --> 01:20.255
Though the English never called a triangle "odd,"...

01:20.842 --> 01:24.537
...they did borrow the "odd" number and the "odd" man.

01:25.152 --> 01:30.054
And finally, in the 16th century, the notion of the "odd man out"...

01:30.456 --> 01:33.189
...gave rise to our modern meaning "peculiar."
