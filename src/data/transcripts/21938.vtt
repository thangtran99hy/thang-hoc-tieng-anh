Mysteries of Vernacular.

00:09.756 --> 00:14.007
Yankee: a New England resident or, more generally,...

00:14.335 --> 00:17.462
...a person who lives in or is from the United States.

00:18.420 --> 00:24.215
Though the origin of "Yankee" is uncertain, this all-American word most likely descended from...

00:24.286 --> 00:31.020
...the Dutch moniker "Janke," a diminutive meaning "little Jan" or "little John."

00:31.990 --> 00:38.476
In the 17th century, "Janke" was the common nickname of Dutch sailors, pirates in particular.

00:39.212 --> 00:44.326
A Dutch pirate ship operating in the West Indies was even called the Yankey.

00:45.031 --> 00:51.395
Over the years, "Yankee" transformed from a pirate's nickname into a general term of contempt.

00:52.099 --> 00:58.540
In 1758, British general James Wolfe used "Yankee" as a pejorative term...

00:58.849 --> 01:01.107
...for the colonists under his supervision.

01:01.747 --> 01:04.118
But the insult wasn't limited to soldiers.

01:04.845 --> 01:07.647
"Yankee" quickly came to mean "New Englander,"...

01:08.469 --> 01:13.166
...and by the 1780s, it was used to look down upon any American.

01:14.345 --> 01:18.185
During the Revolution, colonists co-opted "Yankee"...

01:18.645 --> 01:21.319
...and transformed it into a mark of national honor.

01:22.225 --> 01:26.512
The Civil War, however, intensified the derisive definition...

01:26.839 --> 01:30.441
...when it was used by Southerners to mock members of the Union.

01:31.117 --> 01:33.617
Today, it carries much less emotion.

01:34.276 --> 01:37.201
Unless, of course, we're talking about baseball.
