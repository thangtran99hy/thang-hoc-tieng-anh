So what were you like as a kid?

00:05.261 --> 00:07.811
I remember when I was just a few years older than you,...

00:08.139 --> 00:12.003
...your great grandpa Abe and your great grandma Rose and her sisters...

00:12.371 --> 00:14.379
...came over to our apartment for Thanksgiving.

00:15.566 --> 00:18.048
After dinner, I found this tape recorder lying around...

00:18.342 --> 00:20.216
...and somehow I got the idea to interview them.

00:20.834 --> 00:23.626
A few years later, your great grandpa and your great grandma...

00:23.698 --> 00:25.169
...and all her sisters passed away...

00:26.043 --> 00:27.781
...but I remembered I'd made that tape.

00:28.128 --> 00:30.965
So I went looking for it but I couldn't find it.

00:32.085 --> 00:34.322
I don't get it, why do you keep looking for it?

00:35.383 --> 00:37.772
You know, doing that recording really taught me something.

00:38.184 --> 00:41.387
You can find the most amazing stories from regular people.

00:42.007 --> 00:45.159
All you have to do is ask them about their lives and listen.

00:45.701 --> 00:48.185
We can learn so much about the people all around us,...

00:48.655 --> 00:50.349
...even about the people you already know...

00:50.804 --> 00:53.329
...just by taking the time to have a conversation.

00:53.691 --> 00:58.576
And if you pay just a little attention, you'll find wisdom and poetry in their words.

00:58.976 --> 01:03.292
Most people love to be listened to because it tells them how much their lives matter.

01:03.951 --> 01:06.801
When you're curious, treat people with respect...

01:06.910 --> 01:09.801
...and have just a little courage to ask the important questions.

01:10.204 --> 01:11.430
Great things are gonna happen.
