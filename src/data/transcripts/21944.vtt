00:12.671 --> 00:20.911
Every day I wake up knowing that the more people I try to save, the more enemies I will make.

00:22.967 --> 00:30.752
And it's just a matter of time before I face those with more power than I can overcome.

00:35.001 --> 00:36.093
I'm so sorry, I'm late.

00:37.675 --> 00:38.717
I had a traffic thing.

00:39.023 --> 00:44.132
Did your traffic jam have anything to do with being, I don't know, shot at by machine guns.

00:46.599 --> 00:49.327
Yeah, yeah that was implied, I was implying that.

00:52.248 --> 00:52.970
Peter Parker.

00:53.297 --> 00:54.239
Harry Osborn.

00:54.563 --> 00:55.677
You're gonna want to see this.

00:56.179 --> 00:58.686
Oscorp had you under surveillance.

00:59.201 --> 00:59.592
Why?

00:59.739 --> 01:01.077
Isn't that the question of the day.

01:03.249 --> 01:05.173
There's something you're not telling me, Aunt May.

01:05.763 --> 01:08.856
I once told you secrets have a cost.

01:09.979 --> 01:10.979
The truth does too.

01:12.719 --> 01:18.000
My name is Richard Parker, I have discovered what Oscorp was going to use my research for.

01:18.260 --> 01:22.179
I have a responsibility to protect the world from what I know they're capable of.

01:24.220 --> 01:25.274
What is all this?

01:26.057 --> 01:27.105
The future.

01:28.354 --> 01:31.942
We literally can change the world.

01:33.873 --> 01:34.993
What about Peter?

01:35.211 --> 01:37.704
Not everyone has a happy ending.

01:46.371 --> 01:47.640
This is bigger than you, Peter.

01:49.943 --> 01:50.831
I made a choice.

01:51.671 --> 01:52.491
This is my path.

01:54.758 --> 01:59.597
Soon, everyone in this city will know how it feels to live in a world...

02:01.109 --> 02:09.939
...without power, without mercy, without Spider-Man.
