00:00.131 --> 00:02.129
As an exercise, picture this:...

00:02.651 --> 00:05.783
...you turn the world upside down and you give it a shake.

00:06.577 --> 00:08.568
Watch his lunch money fall out of his pockets.

00:09.019 --> 00:11.065
Imagine what you could do with the world's lunch money.

00:11.696 --> 00:13.044
So much chocolate milk.

00:13.557 --> 00:14.554
So many cookies.

00:15.261 --> 00:18.493
So you just keep shaking and shaking and shaking...

00:19.638 --> 00:23.109
...'cause the thing is, no one's just gonna give it to you.

00:23.896 --> 00:24.907
So come on, world.

00:25.654 --> 00:26.456
How much you got?
