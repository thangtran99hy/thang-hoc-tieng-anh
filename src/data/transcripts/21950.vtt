00:00.040 --> 00:02.392
ï»¿With more than 1,000 patents to his name,...

00:02.631 --> 00:06.382
...Thomas Edison is one of the most celebrated inventors in history.

00:06.830 --> 00:11.047
But does he really deserve credit for his most famous invention, the light bulb?

00:11.424 --> 00:14.227
The real story is more complicated than you might imagine.

00:14.881 --> 00:19.017
Almost 40 years before Edison was granted a patent for an electric lamp in 1880,...

00:19.289 --> 00:21.284
...an Englishman named Frederick de Moleyns...

00:21.824 --> 00:24.466
...claimed the first patent for a filament-based incandescent lamp.

00:24.881 --> 00:28.823
In de Moleyns's patented design, an electric current heated powdered charcoal...

00:29.300 --> 00:32.050
...between two platinum wires in an evacuated glass tube.

00:32.816 --> 00:36.220
Unfortunately, such early light bulbs weren't commercially viable.

00:36.637 --> 00:40.323
The platinum filaments were too expensive and burned out too quickly.

00:40.935 --> 00:44.684
De Moleyns was just one of the inventors working on lighting up the world.

00:45.141 --> 00:49.258
Another Englishman named Joseph Swan actually demonstrated a working lamp...

00:49.746 --> 00:51.741
...with a carbon filament in early 1879,...

00:52.529 --> 00:54.874
...nearly a year before Edison's version debut.

00:55.149 --> 00:59.163
But despite Swan's successes, his bulbs were not useful for consumers either...

00:59.523 --> 01:02.317
...as they still burned out too quickly to be an affordable solution.

01:03.100 --> 01:06.994
Finally, in October 1879, Edison had a breakthrough...

01:07.493 --> 01:11.115
...when he realized that a very thin carbon filament with high electrical resistance...

01:11.507 --> 01:13.011
...was needed to make a light bulb practical.

01:13.722 --> 01:16.371
After testing as many as 6,000 different materials,...

01:16.955 --> 01:19.433
...he settled on carbonized bamboo to make his filaments.

01:19.645 --> 01:23.895
And by early 1880, Edison's bulbs could last some 600 hours.

01:24.286 --> 01:28.591
In fact, the bulb he created is very similar to the light bulbs we use today.
