00:06.643 --> 00:10.106
One of the most improbable experiences for me is just the career that I've had.

00:10.201 --> 00:11.873
I grew up in a small town in Viriginia.

00:12.013 --> 00:14.986
When I began my job, I'm not sure I even thought about what innovation was,...

00:15.266 --> 00:18.273
...and I think now, I look at innovation as just an ongoing journey.

00:18.411 --> 00:20.054
One of the things, I feel very passionately,...

00:20.131 --> 00:22.266
...that I've learned and that we're trying to do more of at GE,...

00:22.336 --> 00:24.057
...is that innovation comes in many forms.

00:24.135 --> 00:25.303
It's a quest to be better.

00:25.637 --> 00:30.927
It's a quest to delight, surprise, find the solutions for big, vexing problems.

00:31.045 --> 00:36.507
I think it's much more of a calling than when I first started my career.

00:36.603 --> 00:40.203
I'm very happy to be able to participate in that kind of scaling innovation...

00:40.281 --> 00:41.789
...that a company like mine does.

00:41.865 --> 00:43.455
And you're never really done.
