00:01.076 --> 00:02.068
I had a black dog.

00:02.925 --> 00:04.015
His name was Depression.

00:07.067 --> 00:08.859
Whenever the black dog made an appearance,...

00:09.073 --> 00:11.565
...I felt empty and life just seemed to slow down.

00:12.663 --> 00:15.998
He would surprise me with a visit for no reason or occasion.

00:17.471 --> 00:20.606
The black dog made me look and feel older than my years.

00:22.087 --> 00:23.989
When the rest of the world seemed to be enjoying life,...

00:24.448 --> 00:26.316
...I could only see it through the black dog.

00:27.601 --> 00:31.192
Activities that usually brought me pleasure suddenly ceased to.

00:32.910 --> 00:34.738
He liked to ruin my appetite.

00:36.897 --> 00:39.635
He chewed up my memory and my ability to concentrate.

00:41.131 --> 00:46.485
Doing anything or going anywhere with the black dog required superhuman strength.

00:47.760 --> 00:51.863
At social occasions, he'd sniff out what confidence I had and chase it away.

00:53.071 --> 00:55.073
My biggest fear was being found out.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.841
I worried that people would judge me.

00:57.513 --> 01:00.136
Because of the shame and stigma of the black dog,...

01:00.321 --> 01:02.519
...I was constantly worried that I'd be found out,...

01:02.923 --> 01:06.287
...so I invested vast amounts of energy into covering him up.

01:06.721 --> 01:09.401
Keeping up an emotional lie is exhausting.

01:10.725 --> 01:14.184
Black dog could make me think and say negative things.

01:16.087 --> 01:18.995
He could make me irritable and difficult to be around.

01:20.969 --> 01:24.275
He would take my love and bury my intimacy.

01:27.591 --> 01:31.967
Eventually, I felt totally isolated from everything and everyone.

01:33.767 --> 01:37.359
The black dog had finally succeeded in hijacking my life.

01:37.704 --> 01:41.579
When you lose all joy in life, you can begin to question what the point of it is.
