00:00.050 --> 00:02.703
Some of the latest advancements in robotics are pretty impressive.

00:03.228 --> 00:07.217
Just look at Atlas, a humanoid robot built for the US defense department.

00:07.607 --> 00:10.926
Atlas is remarkable because it's built to look and act like a person.

00:11.147 --> 00:13.799
But sometimes, engineers get a little carried away.

00:14.186 --> 00:17.041
They end up with a creation that drifts into a no-man's-land...

00:17.203 --> 00:20.737
...between something that's lifelike and something that's actually alive.

00:21.062 --> 00:24.198
This void is commonly referred to as the "uncanny valley."

00:24.525 --> 00:27.829
Journeying into the valley often elicits an emotional response...

00:27.917 --> 00:30.597
...that's somewhere between uncomfortable and creeped out.

00:31.055 --> 00:35.671
Japanese robotics professor Masahiro Mori coined the phrase way back in 1970.

00:35.853 --> 00:40.354
He noted that a positive reaction toward a humanlike robot can quickly turn to disgust.

00:40.747 --> 00:41.996
Mori thought this response...

00:42.065 --> 00:44.973
...was triggered by subtle imperfections in the robot's appearance.

00:45.321 --> 00:48.061
Another hypothesis has to do with our expectations...

00:48.145 --> 00:51.056
...of how people and robots are supposed to look and act.

00:51.288 --> 00:53.855
Atlas, for example, clearly looks like a robot.

00:54.128 --> 00:56.525
You'd have no problem leaving him in your garage overnight.

00:57.008 --> 01:00.769
Animation also provides us with some examples of the uncanny valley effect.

01:01.188 --> 01:04.817
Movies like The Polar Express and Beowulf were widely panned...

01:04.917 --> 01:07.569
...because their characters ventured in the uncanny territory.

01:07.908 --> 01:10.562
It's especially difficult for roboticists and animators...

01:10.641 --> 01:13.151
...to render lifelike hair, eyes and skin tone.

01:13.381 --> 01:15.436
It's even harder when you introduce motion.

01:16.045 --> 01:20.091
New technologies promise to bridge the gap between the lifelike and the living,...

01:20.558 --> 01:22.031
...but they're trying to hit a moving target.

01:22.798 --> 01:26.398
The uncanny valley begins and ends in different places for different people.

01:26.985 --> 01:29.703
And besides, we like to think that humans can't be replicated.
