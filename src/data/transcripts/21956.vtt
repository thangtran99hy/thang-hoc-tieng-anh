Hello, I'm Natasha Bedingfield.

00:01.974 --> 00:02.245
What's going on?

00:02.617 --> 00:03.203
This is Drizzy Drake.

00:03.281 --> 00:05.991
Hey, I'm Pat and I'm here with Jimmy and Scott and we're Train.

00:06.091 --> 00:10.005
What's up? This is yours truly, Mike Posner wishing everyone a happy New Year.

00:10.289 --> 00:11.050
Happy New Year to everyone.

00:11.323 --> 00:12.557
Happy New Year everybody!

00:13.601 --> 00:14.739
New Year's traditions?

00:14.818 --> 00:17.535
As far as traditions go, I don't really have any actually.

00:17.844 --> 00:20.300
I hang out with my friends and rage.

00:20.746 --> 00:23.628
My New Year's tradition just usually involve drinking.

00:23.950 --> 00:24.768
Not get too drunk.

00:25.101 --> 00:26.365
That's quite a good tradition.

00:26.657 --> 00:27.232
Trouble.

00:27.645 --> 00:33.031
The next day, on New Year's Day, I always get a really big breakfast, American style.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.438
Basically, trying to make the New Year better than the year before.

00:35.707 --> 00:37.617
My New Year's tradition is to kiss every girl in the room.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.596
Drink a lot, have fun and sing Auld Lang Syne.
