These are the space cadets,...

00:06.815 --> 00:10.983
...young engineers with a job that's quite literally out of this world.

00:11.332 --> 00:15.582
They've turned their dreams of working in space into a down-to-earth career.

00:16.069 --> 00:20.248
I love working in the Mars Rover mission because it is very cool.

00:21.214 --> 00:25.013
And I think most people in the world would agree that working on a mission...

00:25.105 --> 00:28.107
...that's ultimately going to trundle around on Mars is pretty cool.

00:31.355 --> 00:38.622
The coolest thing about this job is that you are driving a spacecraft...

00:39.215 --> 00:40.352
...which is in another planet.

00:41.161 --> 00:42.678
I mean, how cool is that?

00:45.081 --> 00:49.195
Just, I think, five years ago, my biggest dream would be,...

00:49.826 --> 00:54.152
...was actually, just to touch something that was going to space.

00:54.597 --> 00:57.575
And now I'm working with instruments that are going to space.

00:57.899 --> 00:58.800
It's unbelievable.
