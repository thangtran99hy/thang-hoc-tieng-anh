I think everybody has their sort of unique characteristics.

00:10.636 --> 00:15.479
And I think portraying that in an interview is talking about what brings you to that interview.

00:15.717 --> 00:20.347
It's important for each candidate to leave me with what are the two or three or four things...

00:20.451 --> 00:21.807
...that are truly unique about them.

00:22.282 --> 00:26.090
But then, in addition to that, helping me understand how those two or three or four...

00:26.651 --> 00:29.340
...unique things are relevant for Steward Health Care.

00:29.720 --> 00:34.370
So, it's how are they different and how does that difference apply to the job at hand.

00:34.853 --> 00:39.087
The idea that you have a sort of a mission, that you have a way of packaging,...

00:39.860 --> 00:41.326
...what it is that you do is important.

00:41.431 --> 00:45.459
There's nothing wrong with trying to build a construct around what you do,...

00:45.559 --> 00:50.098
...it's just a personal "brand" to make it sound like you're gonna make a logo for yourself.

00:50.234 --> 00:51.278
And that's probably a bit much.
