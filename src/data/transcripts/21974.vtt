ï»¿All you have to do is to look at a newborn child and watch their eyes move around.

00:13.315 --> 00:16.992
We want to see, to explore.

00:17.841 --> 00:20.362
We, as human beings, we need that.

00:23.179 --> 00:26.011
I wasn't one of those absolute naturals,...

00:26.151 --> 00:30.407
...but since childhood I've seen pictures of the great explorers...

00:30.623 --> 00:33.682
...and I felt that I'd like to plant the flag.

00:34.861 --> 00:38.028
The three of us, we were weary fiery people.

00:38.866 --> 00:41.179
The bug was on our back to perform.

00:43.305 --> 00:48.164
We really had, with the backpacks, what we needed to survive.

00:52.920 --> 00:56.561
There's a little bit of danger in the unknown.

00:57.061 --> 01:03.969
But human beings, I find, are just not apt to back away from something that is a challenge.

01:06.581 --> 01:08.056
Took eight days altogether.

01:09.048 --> 01:12.418
Yeah, we barely made it, but we did make it.

01:12.730 --> 01:15.664
We were pushing the limits pretty close.

01:18.802 --> 01:23.009
Feelings are not something that we have recorders for.

01:25.955 --> 01:32.305
People will always have a desire to explore what they haven't seen:...

01:32.384 --> 01:38.617
...whether it's above us, on the surface or down in the depths of the ocean.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.051
We feel that this stands as a symbol...

01:42.415 --> 01:47.267
...of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown.
