Why does the world need the new weekly publication covering Asian business?

00:04.700 --> 00:07.626
Because there are stories in Asia that are yet to be told.

00:07.977 --> 00:12.109
Stories that will transform the way we do business and the way we live.

00:12.649 --> 00:17.041
There are stories that are only told to locals, stories that cross borders,...

00:17.263 --> 00:23.161
...stories that connect one side of Asia to another in ways that are not always obvious.

00:23.578 --> 00:25.944
We're here to tell those stories.

00:26.091 --> 00:29.314
With reporters on the ground and more locations across Asia...

00:29.633 --> 00:31.446
...than any other business publication,...

00:31.734 --> 00:36.723
...and with a network of contributors, that includes captains of industry, academics,...

00:36.957 --> 00:39.320
...and political leaders from across the region,...

00:39.671 --> 00:43.932
...all backed by Nikkei's extensive editorial unit in Tokyo,...

00:44.226 --> 00:48.533
...this English language publication would bring you analysis and insights from Asia...

00:49.208 --> 00:57.138
...from the inside out, in print, on our website and our new tablet and mobile device.

00:57.771 --> 01:01.527
So, when it comes to business in Asia, see what others don't.

01:01.955 --> 01:03.075
Nikkei Asian Review.
