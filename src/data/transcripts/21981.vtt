The way I dealt with uncertainty is I just stayed the course.

00:05.120 --> 00:08.289
I really believed in my vision, I believed in my product...

00:08.631 --> 00:10.599
...and I believed in our company.

00:11.055 --> 00:16.739
And even though we had to struggle, we stayed true to our vision and our integrity.

00:18.769 --> 00:23.469
You don't want to keep changing your mode based on what's happening outside...

00:23.543 --> 00:27.099
...because then you get lost, because you don't have a true identity,...

00:27.926 --> 00:30.359
...and most likely you won't have long-term success.
