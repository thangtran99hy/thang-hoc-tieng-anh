In 1963, Jack Welch had been working for three years as a chemical engineer for GE Plastics.

00:06.493 --> 00:10.916
One day while sitting in his office, he heard an explosion from the chemical plant.

00:11.984 --> 00:13.079
Jack's heart sank.

00:13.453 --> 00:15.449
Instead of through the roof profits,...

00:15.635 --> 00:19.373
...his team was responsible for literally blowing the roof off a lab.

00:22.205 --> 00:25.795
As the manager, Jack had to drive out and explain what had happened.

00:27.240 --> 00:30.520
By the end of the 100-mile trip, he was a nervous wreck.

00:38.949 --> 00:42.147
But Charlie Reed, the corporate group executive, didn't fire Jack.

00:42.569 --> 00:46.237
He was more interested in learning from the experience than laying blame.

00:46.847 --> 00:49.089
Jack learned a valuable lesson that day.

00:49.391 --> 00:52.872
When people make mistakes, the last thing they need is discipline.

00:53.267 --> 00:55.197
What they need is encouragement.

00:55.897 --> 00:59.056
Charlie Reed was responsible for keeping Jack Welch in the company...

00:59.370 --> 01:01.550
...where he would later become CEO.

01:01.987 --> 01:05.252
The influence of Charlie Reed as well as that of countless others,...

01:05.389 --> 01:07.759
...changed not only the destiny of Jack Welch...

01:08.099 --> 01:10.825
...but through him, the destiny of GE.

01:12.987 --> 01:15.798
Welcome to the relationship revolution.
