What is strong?

00:06.069 --> 00:09.155
Is it muscle or something more?

00:11.975 --> 00:14.830
Is it measured in miles or milliseconds?

00:18.195 --> 00:21.281
Is it your best time or your worst day?

00:22.573 --> 00:25.156
Maybe strong is just what you have left...

00:26.900 --> 00:28.380
...when you've used up all your weak.
