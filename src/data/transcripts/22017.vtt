ï»¿I'm Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Google.

00:03.012 --> 00:06.811
The biggest change for consumers is going to be that everyone's gonna have a smartphone.

00:06.943 --> 00:10.731
And the fact that so many people are connected to what is essentially a supercomputer...

00:10.806 --> 00:14.687
...means a whole new generation of applications around entertainment,...

00:15.316 --> 00:17.588
...education, social life, those kinds of things.

00:17.901 --> 00:21.445
The trend has been that mobile was winning; it's now won.

00:21.758 --> 00:24.777
There are more tablets and phones being sold than personal computers,...

00:25.063 --> 00:27.667
...people are moving to this new architecture very fast.

00:27.909 --> 00:30.059
The biggest disruptor that we're sure about...

00:30.229 --> 00:33.505
...is the arrival of big data and machine intelligence everywhere.

00:33.931 --> 00:37.239
So the ability to find people, to talk specifically to them,...

00:37.389 --> 00:39.404
...to judge them, to rank what they're doing,...

00:39.463 --> 00:43.393
...to decide what to do with your products, changes every business globally.

00:44.117 --> 00:47.526
The biggest disruption that we don't really know what's gonna happen...

00:47.637 --> 00:49.300
...is probably in the genetics area.

00:49.950 --> 00:52.556
The ability to have personal genetic records...

00:52.633 --> 00:56.326
...and ability to start gathering all of the gene sequencing into places...

00:56.662 --> 01:01.207
...will yield discoveries in cancer treatment and diagnostics over the next year...

01:01.497 --> 01:03.272
...that are unfathomably important.
