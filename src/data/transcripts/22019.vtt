ï»¿It's Bob's first day to walk alone in 26 years.

00:05.735 --> 00:10.240
His therapists at Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Center are measuring Emilio...

00:10.349 --> 00:12.178
...and adjusting a high-tech suit.

00:12.291 --> 00:17.426
That suit will lift him out of his wheelchair and prompt his legs to move.

00:17.698 --> 00:21.226
The hardware is an Ekso bionic exoskeleton:...

00:21.591 --> 00:23.065
...a wearable robot.

00:23.263 --> 00:28.237
When a therapist pushes the button, the Ekso guides the patient forward and up.

00:28.645 --> 00:33.528
Then these battery-powered motors take over like muscles, encouraging the legs to move.

00:33.694 --> 00:36.709
Russ Angold is the co-founder of Ekso Bionics.

00:36.819 --> 00:39.771
They still bear their own weight on their bone structure.

00:40.163 --> 00:43.578
The Ekso just provides the support and the ability to move.

00:46.343 --> 00:48.860
Kevin Oldt is an Ekso success story.

00:49.306 --> 00:52.574
He says Ekso brings more than physical changes.

00:52.895 --> 00:55.110
When you put hope into somebody that lost hope,...

00:55.892 --> 00:59.121
...it changes their whole way of living and life...

00:59.881 --> 01:00.451
...a hundred percent.
