00:03.827 --> 00:09.474
We're here at a local shelter organizing for Martin Luther King Lend a Hand Project.

00:10.032 --> 00:14.069
It's fitting with UPMC's corporate culture to volunteer and give back.

00:14.329 --> 00:18.002
We are cleaning and we are trying to organize this.

00:19.943 --> 00:24.121
I'm here today because I got a personal invitation from Michelle Obama...

00:24.246 --> 00:27.285
...to dedicate some time today on Martin Luther King Day,...

00:27.368 --> 00:31.199
...and it is my pleasure to be here at the Center for Victims.

00:32.687 --> 00:34.272
Well, I'm actually new to UPMC.

00:34.354 --> 00:35.873
I just started in October.

00:35.947 --> 00:39.463
And when I saw the e-mail about Dignity and Respect...

00:39.735 --> 00:44.433
...and the event on Martin Luther King Jr. Day that happened to be at my church...

00:44.742 --> 00:49.474
I was really excited today about Martin Luther King Day and the inauguration fell on today,...

00:49.796 --> 00:53.151
...and I wanted to do something besides just watching the inauguration on TV.

00:53.275 --> 00:56.637
So I'm gonna be part of the UPMC family today,...

00:56.719 --> 00:59.047
...lending a hand for Dignity and Respect.

00:59.622 --> 01:02.947
We get the volunteers from UPMC to come out and participate with us.

01:03.299 --> 01:06.500
And then from there, we bring our children and our family members,...

01:06.587 --> 01:08.727
...and we have a great time together.
