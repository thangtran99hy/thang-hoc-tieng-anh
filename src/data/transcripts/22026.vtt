00:04.351 --> 00:06.776
Unfortunately, Tokyo is always expensive,...

00:06.886 --> 00:08.754
...but some seasons are worse than others.

00:09.696 --> 00:13.231
Summer sees the most visitors so prices will be at their highest.

00:14.373 --> 00:16.378
Tokyo summers are sweltering as well,...

00:16.492 --> 00:19.547
...so if you don't like heat, it's best to visit in a different season.

00:20.594 --> 00:23.145
On the other hand, winter can be quite cold,...

00:23.394 --> 00:26.303
...but it doesn't freeze often and snow is uncommon.

00:26.641 --> 00:31.199
Since there's plenty to do indoors in Tokyo, the winter isn't a bad time to visit.

00:32.004 --> 00:34.041
If you do choose to visit during the winter,...

00:34.207 --> 00:38.217
...just keep in mind that most restaurants, shops and museums will be closed...

00:38.293 --> 00:40.007
...for the days surrounding the New Year.

00:41.050 --> 00:45.567
The Golden Week holidays in early May should also be avoided for the same reason,...

00:45.930 --> 00:48.298
...but if you visit earlier in the spring,...

00:48.733 --> 00:52.125
...you may have a chance of seeing the cherry blossoms bloom.

00:52.434 --> 00:54.717
This is a very popular time to visit,...

00:54.980 --> 00:56.688
...so you may need to book in advance.

00:57.135 --> 00:59.405
The cherry blossom season doesn't last long,...

00:59.531 --> 01:03.464
...so research exactly when it's predicted to happen to make sure you don't miss it.

01:04.319 --> 01:06.837
Tokyo's fall foliage is also stunning...

01:06.915 --> 01:09.909
...and the fall lasts longer in Tokyo than many other places.

01:10.381 --> 01:14.142
It will also be less crowded, as the summer tourists will have cleared out.

01:15.051 --> 01:16.987
Spring and fall both have mild weather.

01:17.261 --> 01:20.141
They may be the most pleasant times to visit Tokyo,...

01:20.356 --> 01:22.695
...but it's easy to enjoy the city year-round.
