What do Samsung Electronics CEO Lee Kun-hee,...

00:03.301 --> 00:08.390
...figure skater Kim Yuna and Girls' Generation members Yoona and Sooyoung have in common?

00:09.017 --> 00:10.887
They were all born in the Year of the Horse,...

00:11.097 --> 00:13.648
...and people born under this sign in the Chinese zodiac...

00:13.977 --> 00:18.819
...are said to be outgoing, energetic and clever with ingenious communication techniques.

00:19.148 --> 00:22.511
But there's more to it than that and if you want to know more,...

00:22.823 --> 00:25.607
...you can head over to the National Folk Museum of Korea,...

00:25.880 --> 00:28.399
...which is marking the Year of the Horse with an exhibition...

00:28.487 --> 00:31.158
...to help visitors understand what it's all about.

00:33.225 --> 00:35.146
The New Year will be the Year of the Horse.

00:35.244 --> 00:39.485
The horse is a dynamic animal, so with that in mind, we devised this exhibition...

00:39.733 --> 00:44.106
...to help people understand what a big part of our lives and culture horses are.

00:44.599 --> 00:47.227
Visitors will have a chance to see how horses in Korea...

00:47.341 --> 00:49.661
...from the Joseon Dynasty to the present day...

00:49.952 --> 00:52.605
...were used and what they looked like on different occasions.

00:54.132 --> 00:56.133
Through this exhibition, we had a chance...

00:56.209 --> 00:59.928
...to learn about different types of horses and their characteristics.

01:01.080 --> 01:04.653
There are dozens of artifacts, tools and other implements on display,...

01:04.896 --> 01:08.376
...with detailed information about each piece and how it was used.

01:08.619 --> 01:11.913
The exhibition is scheduled to run through February 17th.

01:13.103 --> 01:15.213
The Year of the Horse gives us a fresh start,...

01:15.359 --> 01:19.027
...a clean slate to make up for our mistakes and fulfill our goals.
