It's possible to enjoy San Francisco year-round,...

00:07.280 --> 00:11.411
...but you might want to consider the city's unusual weather when planning your trip.

00:12.113 --> 00:15.984
Summers are usually chilly, with daily highs often below 70.

00:16.728 --> 00:19.144
Fog keeps it from getting sunny for most of the day...

00:19.241 --> 00:22.063
...and winds coming off the Pacific will make you shiver.

00:22.605 --> 00:25.187
Spring will be better in terms of crowds and prices,...

00:25.438 --> 00:28.403
...but don't expect dry, warm, comfortable days.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.060
If you don't mind carrying an umbrella,...

00:31.246 --> 00:33.500
...winter is a great time to visit San Francisco.

00:33.860 --> 00:38.674
It will be windy and rainy, but it rarely actually freezes and storms are unusual.

00:40.033 --> 00:42.261
But the very best time to visit is in the fall,...

00:42.411 --> 00:45.035
...which is often the warmest and sunniest season.

00:45.529 --> 00:48.132
Fall is also outside of peak tourist season,...

00:48.315 --> 00:50.683
...making it less expensive and less crowded.

00:51.775 --> 00:54.179
Whenever you visit, you'll need to bring a jacket.

00:54.729 --> 00:58.754
Even in the warmer months, it tends to get cold quickly as evening sets in.
