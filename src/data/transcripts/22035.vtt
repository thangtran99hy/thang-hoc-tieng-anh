Hello, I'm Alex Villareal with VOA 60 America for January 9th.

00:07.047 --> 00:12.373
The US military is investigating two deadly crashes that occurred within 24 hours.

00:12.716 --> 00:17.235
The Navy says two of five sailors aboard a helicopter that crashed Wednesday...

00:17.571 --> 00:23.207
...during a training mission off the coast of Virginia have died, and one is still missing.

00:23.675 --> 00:26.575
Two other sailors are being treated for injuries.

00:26.930 --> 00:30.435
Another helicopter crashed during a training exercise in Britain Wednesday,...

00:30.733 --> 00:32.968
...killing all four crew members.

00:33.771 --> 00:38.346
A scandal continues to unfold as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie says...

00:38.443 --> 00:43.642
...it is unacceptable that his aide allegedly orchestrated traffic mayhem...

00:43.880 --> 00:46.062
...to pursue a political vendetta.

00:47.002 --> 00:51.630
Finally, retired American basketball star Dennis Rodman apologized...

00:51.752 --> 00:54.649
...for an incoherent, profanity-filled rant...

00:54.953 --> 00:59.451
...in which he appeared to blame a US citizen for being held by North Korea.

00:59.900 --> 01:02.418
State Department and White House officials have stressed...

01:02.716 --> 01:06.865
...that Rodman's trip to North Korea was not sanctioned by the US.

01:07.333 --> 01:08.371
That's all for today.

01:08.613 --> 01:09.437
Thanks for watching.
