00:01.238 --> 00:05.924
The second labor challenges Hercules to kill another monstrous freak of nature,...

00:06.975 --> 00:13.302
...the dreaded nine-headed Hydra, a poison-spitting serpent that devours men in one bite.

00:16.493 --> 00:19.173
Hercules draws his sword and attacks.

00:20.737 --> 00:23.305
He slices through one of the Hydra's necks,...

00:25.945 --> 00:31.584
...then another, decapitating the monster one head at a time.

00:33.783 --> 00:37.943
But as soon as each head is cut off, two more grow in its place.

00:39.150 --> 00:41.717
This represents the human lust for pleasure,...

00:41.942 --> 00:44.907
...which the Greeks believe to be unkillable.
