ï»¿Sometimes our mind wanders.

00:10.089 --> 00:11.962
And when we snap back to reality,...

00:12.434 --> 00:15.315
...we have no idea what we missed or how long we were gone.

00:16.376 --> 00:20.104
Daydreaming isn't the only thing that causes this inattention blindness.

00:20.480 --> 00:22.202
When we talk on the phone while driving,...

00:22.731 --> 00:26.731
...there are periods when we go blind to our environment without realizing them.

00:27.334 --> 00:33.844
So billboards, cars, kids playing, even stop signs and red lights can pass us by unnoticed.

00:35.016 --> 00:37.062
Certain things may seem harmless.

00:37.753 --> 00:43.743
But some activities just aren't safe to combine.

00:44.831 --> 00:49.459
Our brain is not wired to pay attention to more than one complex task at a time.

00:49.846 --> 00:52.722
What we're actually doing when we think we're multitasking...

00:52.997 --> 00:56.342
...is quickly shifting our focus from one activity to another.

00:56.742 --> 01:01.163
So while our mind is engaged in applying makeup, arguing with a backseat driver,...

01:01.529 --> 01:05.763
...fumbling for a water bottle, or a conversation, it's blind to the road.

01:06.300 --> 01:10.512
In fact, drivers are four times more likely to crash while talking on the phone...

01:11.187 --> 01:13.718
...and 23 times more likely while texting.

01:14.769 --> 01:17.144
Driving can feel uneventful,...

01:17.419 --> 01:20.723
...but it really takes our full attention to keep the car on the road.

01:21.126 --> 01:24.388
We're surrounded by distractions that can hijack our focus.

01:25.197 --> 01:28.561
Whether we let them is up to us.
