ï»¿Who in here likes soccer?

00:01.513 --> 00:02.565
Me, me!

00:02.881 --> 00:03.597
All right, Leo.

00:03.779 --> 00:04.358
Yeah!

00:05.000 --> 00:07.342
You have to work really hard to be good at teaching.

00:07.441 --> 00:10.703
And the best teachers are the teachers who are always learners.

00:10.879 --> 00:14.252
It's been so eye-opening to see how many are struggling.

00:14.463 --> 00:15.915
Meet four teachers...

00:16.050 --> 00:18.870
When I went in, I wanted to be in the most urban school.

00:19.006 --> 00:21.017
...who have 180 days...

00:21.081 --> 00:23.877
A lot of them don't know anyone who's graduated from highschool.

00:24.106 --> 00:26.822
...to make a 180-degree change.

00:27.063 --> 00:31.249
Their well-being and their future really depend on how well I prepare them for the next level.

From Academy Award winner Davis Guggenheim and Participant Media.

00:35.791 --> 00:38.385
I will always be a learner and a teacher.

00:38.536 --> 00:39.782
It's not a job,...

00:40.060 --> 00:42.499
I think sometimes we forget what it's like to be the student.

00:42.681 --> 00:43.664
...it's a mission.

00:44.117 --> 00:48.851
In terms of the ideal teacher, I don't know if I will ever get there 100 percent,...

00:49.124 --> 00:50.811
...but I'm just gonna keep on going for it.

00:52.169 --> 00:52.944
Teach.
