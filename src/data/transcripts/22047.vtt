00:01.037 --> 00:02.673
Another parking ticket.

00:03.215 --> 00:06.746
Here in New York, one of these will cost you 115 bucks,...

00:06.996 --> 00:11.993
...which is why it might seem crazy that UPS and Fedex shrug off thousands of them every year...

00:12.207 --> 00:13.703
...and millions in fines.

00:15.385 --> 00:17.893
That's the thing about fines in corporations.

00:18.213 --> 00:19.580
The numbers sound really big.

00:19.831 --> 00:22.415
One billion, three billion, 13 billion?

00:22.703 --> 00:25.651
But for a lot of companies, that's just the cost of doing business.

00:25.925 --> 00:27.836
It makes you wonder, do fines really matter?

00:28.144 --> 00:29.223
I'll give you three examples.

00:29.350 --> 00:30.721
Remember the Gulf oil spill?

00:31.219 --> 00:35.631
BP agreed to pay 7.8 billion dollars to settle all sorts of claims over that.

00:36.180 --> 00:39.035
But for BP, that's about eight days of revenue.

00:40.941 --> 00:42.896
Shape-ups are revolutionary.

00:43.033 --> 00:45.451
Skechers claimed that shoes would tone your butt.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.102
Did anyone believe that?

00:47.508 --> 00:48.892
It doesn't matter, they don't.

00:49.359 --> 00:52.158
Skechers was slapped with a 40 million dollar penalty,...

00:52.507 --> 00:56.320
...but they sold nearly 1.6 billion dollars worth of shoes in 2012.

00:56.608 --> 00:59.795
Google paid up the biggest fine in Federal Trade Commission history.

01:00.137 --> 01:04.121
They had to pay 22.5 million dollars for violating online privacy.

01:04.595 --> 01:08.391
But this is Google, it takes all five hours to rake in that much money.

01:08.926 --> 01:12.739
But for executives, for the people in charge, all those billions could be worth it.

01:13.086 --> 01:17.147
That's because the cost is nothing next to the profits that their companies stand to make...

01:17.427 --> 01:18.913
...by doing stuff that gets them in trouble.
