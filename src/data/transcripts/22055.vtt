00:02.821 --> 00:03.948
ï»¿The people love their king.

00:06.655 --> 00:08.243
They know I saved the city.

00:08.322 --> 00:09.689
They know I won the war.

00:16.615 --> 00:17.649
The war is not won.

00:21.045 --> 00:23.280
It's tempting to see your enemies as evil.

00:25.283 --> 00:28.131
But there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought.

00:32.851 --> 00:33.939
They have a choice:...

00:34.320 --> 00:38.371
...they can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.

00:40.147 --> 00:42.203
Things are intense right now.

00:42.373 --> 00:44.315
I don't think I'm talking my way out of this one.

00:47.083 --> 00:48.557
The Wildlings breach the Wall,...

00:48.768 --> 00:50.447
...they'll roll over everything and everyone.

00:52.410 --> 00:56.223
Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love?

00:59.059 --> 01:00.688
I want to know which side you're on.

01:04.128 --> 01:05.219
Tell your father I'm  here.

01:05.738 --> 01:08.601
And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts.

01:10.503 --> 01:13.305
You'll fight over him like beasts until you tear him apart.

01:13.654 --> 01:16.212
I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen.

01:18.369 --> 01:19.008
Wildlings!

01:19.621 --> 01:20.949
Tonight, we fight!

01:22.259 --> 01:23.786
There's only one hell.

01:25.662 --> 01:26.797
The one we live in now.

01:32.989 --> 01:36.979
If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place.
