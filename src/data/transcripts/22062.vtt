ï»¿What happens to a dream deferred?

00:12.340 --> 00:18.487
It leads to bewildering frustration and corroding bitterness.

00:21.312 --> 00:25.568
But somewhere I read of the freedom of assembly.

00:26.143 --> 00:29.615
Somewhere I read of the freedom of speech.

00:30.054 --> 00:33.577
Somewhere I read of the freedom of press.

00:34.229 --> 00:40.920
Somewhere I read that the greatness of America is the right to protest for a right.

00:49.631 --> 00:50.509
Free at last!

00:51.078 --> 00:51.922
Free at last!

00:52.451 --> 00:55.151
Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!

00:57.811 --> 01:00.356
Deep rumblings that we hear today.

01:01.935 --> 01:08.313
Rumbling of discontent is the thunder of disinherited masses,...

01:09.163 --> 01:14.983
...rising from dungeons of oppression to the bright hills of freedom.

01:16.228 --> 01:18.257
All over the world like a fever,...

01:18.455 --> 01:23.153
...freedom is spreading in the widest liberation movement in history.

01:27.554 --> 01:32.444
Martin Luther, stand up for righteousness!

01:35.273 --> 01:36.313
Stand up for justice!

01:38.617 --> 01:39.738
Stand up for truth!

01:41.009 --> 01:45.423
And lo, I will be with you, even until the end of the world.

01:50.837 --> 01:54.241
And I've seen the promised land.

01:55.751 --> 01:59.933
I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight...

02:01.148 --> 02:05.076
...that we as a people will get to the promised land.

02:07.994 --> 02:09.802
I have a dream that one day...

02:10.418 --> 02:15.195
...this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed:...

02:15.505 --> 02:20.993
..."We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal."
