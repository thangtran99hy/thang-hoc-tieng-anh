ï»¿I have the audacity to believe...

00:02.971 --> 00:08.104
...that peoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies,...

00:08.495 --> 00:11.835
...education and culture for their minds,...

00:12.195 --> 00:15.721
...and dignity, equality, and freedom for their spirits.

00:16.219 --> 00:20.000
I believe that what self-centered men have torn down,...

00:20.350 --> 00:22.573
...men other centered can build up.

00:23.605 --> 00:27.224
I still believe that we shall overcome.
