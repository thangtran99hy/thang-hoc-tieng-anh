00:04.109 --> 00:07.661
I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure.

00:08.029 --> 00:08.881
What? No, no.

00:09.157 --> 00:12.357
We do not want any adventures here.

00:12.661 --> 00:12.946
Good morning.

00:17.251 --> 00:17.676
Fair enough.

00:19.483 --> 00:23.217
You are invited on an extraordinary journey...

00:24.129 --> 00:28.373
...through the darkest forest and the deepest caves...

00:29.831 --> 00:37.019
...pursued by the angriest orcs and the hungriest trolls.

00:37.221 --> 00:38.827
Can we cook him?

00:39.189 --> 00:41.277
We can try.

00:43.311 --> 00:45.235
So, gather your strength,...

00:46.687 --> 00:48.205
...gather your friends,...

00:50.181 --> 00:52.495
...and gather your courage.

00:55.828 --> 00:56.889
My name is Bilbo Baggins.

00:57.340 --> 00:58.871
I'm a hobbit from the Shire.

01:01.365 --> 01:02.658
Oh, that could've been worse.
