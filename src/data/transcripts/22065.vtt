00:05.428 --> 00:10.523
With Hammond robotics, you've seen the latest advances in military personnel hardware,...

00:11.175 --> 00:15.563
...supply base defense systems, and suborbital targeting systems.

00:16.595 --> 00:19.375
And of course, the latest in Titan technology.

00:20.429 --> 00:23.825
But the future in Titan Tech is closer than you think.

00:28.041 --> 00:33.031
We present, the Stryder.

00:40.045 --> 00:43.661
In field testing, the Stryder outperforms all other Titans...

00:43.746 --> 00:50.455
...in speed, acceleration, and agility.

00:52.631 --> 00:55.845
But direct action missions is where the Stryder excels.

00:56.535 --> 01:00.063
As the first to strike, Stryder destroys class A defenses...

01:00.163 --> 01:02.373
...with a 63 percent higher success rate.

01:04.155 --> 01:06.370
And it can secure rapid deployment objectives...

01:06.647 --> 01:09.030
...faster than any other Titan on the frontier.

01:15.335 --> 01:18.614
At Hammond robotics, we're bringing the future home.
