There are many qualities necessary in order to be a professional musician,...

00:09.142 --> 00:11.347
...not the least of which are passion and determination,...

00:11.803 --> 00:14.320
...which can manifest themselves in many different ways.

00:15.133 --> 00:18.289
It must be remembered that there are invariably numerous people...

00:18.750 --> 00:22.198
...vying for the same, often underpaid work or opportunities.

00:22.845 --> 00:26.348
And there will inevitably be disappointment along the road to success.

00:27.590 --> 00:32.815
Music gives much fulfillment and pleasure, but should not be regarded as an easy option.

00:33.973 --> 00:37.247
A strong conviction in what one is doing and self-belief...

00:37.802 --> 00:40.591
...are indispensable tools of the professional musician.

00:41.636 --> 00:43.662
However, one also has to be realistic.

00:44.277 --> 00:47.443
And it would be kinder to oneself not to embark on this career path...

00:48.151 --> 00:50.781
...unless you're totally sure that this is what you want to do.

00:51.862 --> 00:55.493
Seek advice from as many people in the profession as is reasonably possible.

00:56.114 --> 00:59.385
And consider consultation lessons from a range of teachers.
