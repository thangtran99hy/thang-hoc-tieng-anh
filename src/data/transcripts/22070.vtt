A lot of companies try to take their construction toys...

00:04.041 --> 00:06.220
...and make them pink to appeal to girls.

00:06.653 --> 00:09.784
And while, yeah, it's true, girls do like pink,...

00:09.869 --> 00:12.048
...I think there's a lot more to us than that.

00:12.381 --> 00:15.453
So, I've spent the last year researching this.

00:15.533 --> 00:18.114
How do you get girls to like a construction toy?

00:18.349 --> 00:20.514
It all kinda came down to one simple thing:...

00:20.664 --> 00:22.811
...boys like building and girls like reading.

00:23.295 --> 00:25.049
It says here, "Do you know the girl named Goldieblox?"

00:25.550 --> 00:27.420
"She likes to think outside the box."

00:27.829 --> 00:30.442
So I came up with a really simple idea:...

00:30.701 --> 00:32.586
...what if I put those two things together?

00:32.703 --> 00:36.234
Spatial plus verbal, book series plus building set.

00:36.457 --> 00:37.431
How long's the ribbon?

00:40.416 --> 00:45.131
I took the story and my prototype and I tested it with over a hundred kids.

00:45.725 --> 00:46.922
We got it!

00:48.565 --> 00:51.198
Daddy! You have to watch this.

00:51.993 --> 00:53.863
And that's how Goldieblox was born.
