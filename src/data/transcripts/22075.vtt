ï»¿What's the worst bug on the planet?

00:09.235 --> 00:11.792
You might vote for the horsefly or perhaps the wasp,...

00:12.311 --> 00:15.694
...but for many people, the worst offender is by far the mosquito.

00:16.309 --> 00:18.570
The buzzing, the biting, the itching.

00:18.977 --> 00:22.008
The mosquito is one of the most commonly detested pests in the world.

00:22.375 --> 00:24.138
But it's not just that mosquitoes are annoying.

00:24.669 --> 00:25.603
They're also deadly.

00:26.031 --> 00:28.705
Mosquitoes can transmit everything from malaria to yellow fever,...

00:28.798 --> 00:30.366
...to West Nile virus to dengue.

00:30.874 --> 00:34.877
Over a million people worldwide die every year from mosquito-borne diseases.

00:35.313 --> 00:36.138
And that's just people.

00:36.636 --> 00:39.812
Horses, dogs, cats, they can all get diseases from mosquitoes too.

00:40.592 --> 00:44.267
So if these bugs are so dastardly, why don't we just get rid of them.

00:44.742 --> 00:47.797
We are humans after all and we're pretty good at getting rid of species.

00:48.457 --> 00:49.931
Well, it's not quite so simple.

00:50.451 --> 00:52.990
Getting rid of the mosquito removes a food source for lots of organisms,...

00:53.083 --> 00:54.721
...like frogs and fish and birds.

00:55.125 --> 00:57.061
Without them, plants will lose a pollener.

00:57.497 --> 01:00.962
But some scientists say that mosquitoes aren't actually all that important.

01:01.439 --> 01:04.695
If we got rid of them, they argue, another species would simply take their place.

01:04.839 --> 01:07.368
And we'd probably have far fewer deaths from malaria.

01:08.574 --> 01:12.463
The problem is that nobody knows what would happen if we killed off all the mosquitoes.

01:13.110 --> 01:17.227
Something better might take their spot or perhaps something even worse.

01:17.825 --> 01:20.332
The question is, are we willing to take that risk?
