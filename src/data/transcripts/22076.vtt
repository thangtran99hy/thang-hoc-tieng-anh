A new technology called "PulseWallet" syncs your credit card to the palm of your hand.

00:06.506 --> 00:12.403
Using a biometric palm reader, this cardless payment service allows you to pay...

00:12.667 --> 00:17.045
...by simply scanning your veins; giving a whole new meaning to blood money.

00:17.185 --> 00:22.043
PulseWallet seems to have the upper hand on other NFC payment systems.

00:22.411 --> 00:26.923
For example, unlike Google Wallet, where you scan your phone for payment,..

00:27.089 --> 00:31.657
...PulseWallet doesn't require you to present anything to make a transaction,...

00:32.235 --> 00:33.156
...other than yourself.

00:33.299 --> 00:36.435
The system was unveiled at CES in Las Vegas...

00:36.645 --> 00:39.209
...and will reportedly go on sale in February.

00:39.436 --> 00:43.455
Something tells me it will have businesses eating out of the palm of its hand.
