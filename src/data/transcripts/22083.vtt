Hi, I'm Michelle Klug with Cooking Light and this is the latest in health news.

00:04.560 --> 00:07.003
A new study all over 80,000 men and women...

00:07.129 --> 00:09.927
...found that drinking green tea or coffee on a regular basis...

00:10.343 --> 00:12.841
...may reduce the risk of stroke by 20 percent.

00:13.376 --> 00:17.597
The Japanese study was published in the American Heart Association's journal "Stroke"...

00:17.967 --> 00:21.863
...and recommended drinking four cups of green tea or one cup of coffee daily...

00:21.961 --> 00:22.933
...to reap the benefits.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.997
While coffee and tea aren't a cure-all, they can improve health...

00:26.135 --> 00:28.175
...when combined with exercise and a healthy diet.
