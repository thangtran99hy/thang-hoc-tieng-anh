Grandpa, grandpa, tell us a story.

00:04.052 --> 00:08.667
Grandpa will tell you a story why we celebrate Chinese New Year.

00:09.220 --> 00:13.038
A long time ago, there lived a monster called Nian.

00:13.508 --> 00:17.747
He came out at the end of every year to terrorize the villagers.

00:21.266 --> 00:23.506
The villagers tried to hide.

00:24.075 --> 00:30.511
One time, the villagers found that the cracking sound of bamboo burning terrified the Nian.

00:30.959 --> 00:34.265
This tradition was later replaced by firecrackers.

00:34.808 --> 00:38.285
Nian was never seen again.
