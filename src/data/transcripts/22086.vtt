ï»¿Who ordered the double cheese and sausage?

00:03.032 --> 00:03.753
Right here, dude.

00:09.055 --> 00:10.895
How do you get your pizza delivered?

00:11.354 --> 00:16.213
Last month, Domino's Pizza teamed up with a creative ad agency titled T + Biscuits...

00:16.321 --> 00:20.537
...to test down a prototype for a flying drone that can deliver cheese pies.

00:21.027 --> 00:25.163
Described as an octocopter, the device carried two large pepperoni pizzas...

00:25.268 --> 00:27.863
...and conducted a flight over a city near London.

00:28.247 --> 00:32.331
The pizzas, both contained in an insulated bag, were secured to the drone.

00:32.655 --> 00:34.319
They were delivered in perfect condition...

00:34.440 --> 00:37.154
...and it only took about ten minutes to venture four miles.

00:37.339 --> 00:41.333
The founder of T + Biscuits stated, "If anything it went quicker than a pizza boy,..."

00:41.485 --> 00:43.819
"...we were amazed at how easy it was going to be."

00:44.347 --> 00:46.754
The drone is being called the DomiCopter.

00:46.942 --> 00:50.987
Although the device won't take the place of human delivery drivers anytime soon,...

00:51.131 --> 00:55.037
...Domino's is reportedly experimenting with the drone at their UK headquarters.

00:55.657 --> 00:58.299
Federal Aviation Administration authorities estimate...

00:58.427 --> 01:03.350
...that private drones will make up a 90-billion-dollar industry within ten years.
