Instagram, in some ways, was an improbable success.

00:09.147 --> 00:12.301
You look at my cofounder and I, and we'd never done a company before.

00:12.737 --> 00:14.145
We were first time entrepreneurs.

00:14.677 --> 00:16.453
We were telling people about what we're working on, and they're like,...

00:16.642 --> 00:18.802
..."No, people have done photo apps before, this is never gonna work."

00:19.313 --> 00:22.439
We showed it to some investors, and they're like, "I'm not interested in photos.

00:22.516 --> 00:24.048
That's kind of been done before, you're gonna fail...

00:24.121 --> 00:26.158
...especially public photos, people aren't gonna like that."

00:26.480 --> 00:29.519
So it's really satisfying and great to launch and...

00:29.795 --> 00:31.624
...actually have this community response of people being like,...

00:31.775 --> 00:32.356
..."No, no, this is good...

00:32.451 --> 00:34.363
...and it actually fills a need that I really had in my life."

00:34.865 --> 00:37.455
Hearing "no" a lot of times usually tells you either you're crazy...

00:37.537 --> 00:40.419
...or you're on the right track and you don't know which one it is until you finally launch.
