00:04.843 --> 00:06.296
I'm a very aesthetic person.

00:06.645 --> 00:10.063
So, I'm very visual.

00:13.003 --> 00:14.562
I definitely always cared about style.

00:15.016 --> 00:18.125
I started working in design when I was 21 and never looked back.

00:18.193 --> 00:20.402
It was one of the best decisions I've ever made, I really love it.

00:22.039 --> 00:24.181
I'm only 30 but I've been doing it for nine years.

00:24.627 --> 00:25.865
Sometimes people are surprised.

00:27.488 --> 00:31.555
I love working with different craftsmen and architects and contractors,...

00:31.979 --> 00:33.551
...and we've always had a good relationship.

00:33.778 --> 00:35.822
Yeah, the first meeting can be intimidating.

00:37.685 --> 00:40.208
If I'm going to meet with someone for the first time,...

00:40.276 --> 00:43.176
...I like to put on a professional and polished outfit.

00:44.057 --> 00:45.917
It just helps me feel more confident.

00:46.809 --> 00:50.065
I'm ready to meet someone new and I'm ready to make a good first impression.

00:50.535 --> 00:55.477
I think hopefully it helps them see that I'm not too young for the job.

00:56.233 --> 00:58.062
I'm a big fan of wrap dresses.

00:58.269 --> 01:00.961
They're professional, they're put together, all in one fell swoop.

01:01.577 --> 01:02.747
What is so me?

01:03.256 --> 01:08.355
So me is just probably, I mean the idea of not taking my style on dressing too seriously.

01:08.577 --> 01:10.695
Not spending hours getting ready in the morning,...

01:11.002 --> 01:13.277
...not meticulously picking everything out.

01:13.376 --> 01:15.905
What I hope it looks like is kind of effortlessly chic.

01:16.131 --> 01:19.803
Just pulling the pieces together quickly and having them represent you well.
