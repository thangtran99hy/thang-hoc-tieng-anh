00:03.911 --> 00:05.406
Well, this is probably the biggest question.

00:05.490 --> 00:07.325
How many miles do I train for a 5K?

00:07.614 --> 00:09.669
Anyone from eight to 80 ask me this question.

00:10.039 --> 00:12.151
And unfortunately, it varies for everybody.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.747
If you're running your very first 5K of your life,...

00:14.873 --> 00:17.115
...you might only be running five or six miles a week...

00:17.327 --> 00:18.621
...and building up to that point.

00:18.982 --> 00:23.608
The elite competitive 5K runners might train 100 to 140 miles per week.

00:23.980 --> 00:28.709
So the question is, really, how much can your body handle without breaking down?

00:28.969 --> 00:32.793
And that means for people who are beginners but have done a 5K before,...

00:33.033 --> 00:34.948
...probably 10 to 20 miles a week.

00:35.215 --> 00:36.884
For those who are a bit more of an intermediate,...

00:37.059 --> 00:38.877
...you're looking at 20 to 30 miles a week.

00:39.071 --> 00:42.877
And local studs and elites are probably moving to 40 to 50 range.

00:43.188 --> 00:46.837
But really, you need to just sort of play with it and see what your body can handle...

00:47.020 --> 00:48.024
...and build from there.

00:48.257 --> 00:51.277
So the lesson is, whatever your body can handle is best for you.
