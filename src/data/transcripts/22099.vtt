ï»¿One thing that's always on my mind is...

00:04.375 --> 00:07.473
...what if, in my deepest, worst moments of self-doubt, I'm right?

00:07.868 --> 00:09.427
What if I really am hideous?

00:12.219 --> 00:13.609
I know owl's feathers are beautiful,...

00:13.702 --> 00:16.207
...but every time I think of myself from a third person perspective,...

00:16.303 --> 00:18.116
...it's like I'm back in middle school.

00:18.535 --> 00:20.534
I know I'm not an awkward, hideous mess now,...

00:20.641 --> 00:23.271
...but if I really think about it, can I be sure?

00:23.703 --> 00:24.180
Can I?

00:24.784 --> 00:26.431
And I'm not talking about how owls eat.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.877
We all rip our prey apart with our talons or just swallow them whole.

00:30.255 --> 00:33.029
It's gross, but we don't have teeth, so it's not our fault.

00:33.719 --> 00:34.990
Plus, we always eat alone.

00:35.296 --> 00:37.672
Okay, maybe I'm not okay with the whole eating thing.

00:37.855 --> 00:41.819
I do think I'm okay with the whole poltergeist, head spinning thing.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.307
Yeah, it's off-putting,...

00:43.375 --> 00:46.047
...but the first time you see it, it's kind of cool.

00:46.111 --> 00:47.541
It's like the tablecloth trick.

00:47.929 --> 00:49.509
Do it all the time and you're a weirdo,...

00:49.603 --> 00:52.279
...but the first time you do it, you're a freaking magician.

00:52.575 --> 00:55.531
I mean, I'd rather be cool once than a mess all the time.

00:55.917 --> 00:56.719
But you know what gets me?

00:57.018 --> 00:59.604
The fact that I'm a mess all the time.

01:00.670 --> 01:03.050
Fun fact: I have three sets of eyelids,...

01:03.250 --> 01:06.453
...one for sleeping, one for blinking and one for cleaning.

01:06.646 --> 01:08.952
I have cleaning eyelids, can you believe it?

01:09.115 --> 01:11.318
It's like biological proof that I'm hideous.

01:11.433 --> 01:12.989
I hate being an owl.
