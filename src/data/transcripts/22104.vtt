You've heard the talk about bringing cloud from the server room to the board room.

00:05.693 --> 00:08.666
Well, cloud is no longer an IT buzzword,...

00:09.205 --> 00:10.373
...it's a business reality.

00:11.035 --> 00:13.329
It isn't just critical for big data and analytics,...

00:13.563 --> 00:17.019
...it's critical to customer engagement initiatives like mobile and social.

00:17.757 --> 00:22.553
We surveyed cloud decision makers and users from around the world, more than 800 of them,...

00:22.908 --> 00:25.676
...to find out how organizations are really using cloud.

00:26.063 --> 00:26.735
I'll give you a hint;...

00:27.222 --> 00:30.243
...it's not just for operational efficiency in workflow optimization.

00:30.575 --> 00:34.189
What we found is that forward-thinking companies across industries...

00:34.284 --> 00:36.509
...are using cloud for strategic reinvention.

00:36.785 --> 00:40.253
They're making better decisions and engaging with customers in smarter ways.

00:40.691 --> 00:44.079
These pacesetters know it's about collaborating across the enterprise...

00:44.160 --> 00:46.885
...and being responsive to the market and ultimately,...

00:46.985 --> 00:48.727
...it's all about the customer experience.

00:48.984 --> 00:55.703
In fact, pacesetters are 136 percent more likely to reinvent customer relationships using cloud.

00:56.133 --> 00:58.191
It's time to get serious about your cloud strategy...

00:58.601 --> 01:01.215
...because those who don't will be left behind.
