One of the biggest perks of owning a 60,000-dollar-plus Tesla...

00:06.545 --> 00:10.309
...is that you get free access to their supercharger stations for life.

00:10.649 --> 00:12.593
So if you wanna take this model S on a road trip,...

00:12.716 --> 00:15.703
...you can fully recharge the battery in just half an hour.

00:16.009 --> 00:18.342
And what's at this supercharger stations anyway?

00:18.493 --> 00:21.221
We're at one in Darien, Connecticut and we're here to find out.

00:25.533 --> 00:26.650
How does this work?

00:29.934 --> 00:31.337
Okay, I got a button.

00:31.574 --> 00:31.887
Alright.

00:36.271 --> 00:40.015
Now we pulled in with about 160 miles of range left on the battery,...

00:40.343 --> 00:43.735
...which leaves us about 70 miles short of a full charge.

00:44.244 --> 00:48.863
And now that we're fully charged, let's get out of here.
