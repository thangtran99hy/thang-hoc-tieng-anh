00:00.495 --> 00:02.315
The best thing I ever read, I saw on the Web.

00:02.543 --> 00:06.753
And quite concisely, it said, "Being happy is better than not being happy.",...

00:06.862 --> 00:10.357
...which is a criminally simplistic composition of thoughts that should be painfully obvious.

00:11.162 --> 00:12.325
Of course, it's not that easy.

00:12.647 --> 00:15.070
How do we even achieve this abstract idea of happiness?

00:15.131 --> 00:17.169
And the key is a simple smile.

00:18.257 --> 00:19.649
See, when you flash those pearly whites...

00:19.728 --> 00:22.433
...your brain reacts the exact same way it would if you took cocaine.

00:22.771 --> 00:25.451
And the endorphins addict you to happiness and your heart beats slower...

00:25.716 --> 00:28.327
...and the cortisol that makes you stressed slips away like a dress on prom night,...

00:28.426 --> 00:32.501
...showing nothing but those pearly white teeth with the message, "Hey, I won't bite."

00:33.020 --> 00:34.813
You could put seven years on your life...

00:34.943 --> 00:38.008
...and you don't have to adhere to some crazy diet; just give in to the addiction.

00:38.854 --> 00:41.569
But unlike most fixations, your dependency is contagious...

00:41.683 --> 00:44.287
...like a USB to a PC with 3 GBs powering it out.

00:44.358 --> 00:46.026
Each smile makes another mouth widen...

00:46.382 --> 00:47.979
...and another frown turns upside down.

00:48.131 --> 00:51.127
Hell, I bet you're smiling now.
