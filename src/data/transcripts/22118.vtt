00:12.093 --> 00:17.504
Beneath, his flying footsteps froze the ground;...

00:18.503 --> 00:23.687
...And with his garments' rustling fell the snow;...

00:24.703 --> 00:28.578
...His lightest touch made icicles abound;...

00:29.163 --> 00:33.380
...His breath, as when the keenest north winds blow.

00:34.239 --> 00:39.593
He paused above the river, dull and gray,...

00:39.959 --> 00:44.176
...turbid and chafing with a restless pain.

00:44.435 --> 00:48.225
And soon in icy quietness it lay,...

00:49.041 --> 00:55.363
...bound, bank to bank, within his Arctic chain.
