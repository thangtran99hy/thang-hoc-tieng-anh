00:07.799 --> 00:10.655
Behold, the miracle called Velcro.

00:10.947 --> 00:12.123
But where did it come from?

00:12.348 --> 00:15.983
Meet George De Mestral born in 1907.

00:16.388 --> 00:19.035
Imagine George who loved the outdoors,...

00:19.305 --> 00:21.980
...walking through fields and forests with his dog.

00:22.433 --> 00:25.684
One day, he noticed how burrs stuck to his clothes...

00:25.975 --> 00:27.336
...and to his dog's fur.

00:28.052 --> 00:30.786
When George looked at a burr under his microscope,...

00:30.988 --> 00:33.731
...he discovered it was covered with many small hooks...

00:34.000 --> 00:38.715
...that caught on tiny natural loops in surfaces like fabric or fur.

00:39.073 --> 00:42.869
George experimented until he managed to reproduce this effect.

00:43.095 --> 00:46.097
When he succeeded, he named the product Velcro,...

00:46.409 --> 00:47.919
...and founded a company to sell it.

00:48.360 --> 00:53.446
The name comes from a combination of the French words velours or velvet,...

00:53.811 --> 00:55.117
...and crochet or hook.
