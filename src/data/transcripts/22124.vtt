00:00.053 --> 00:03.746
So, as it turns out, our brain signals the release of different compounds...

00:03.833 --> 00:04.501
...when we're in love.

00:05.419 --> 00:07.322
Really, there's a whole lot of compounds,...

00:07.617 --> 00:09.627
...but I'm going to tell you today about the main three.

00:09.875 --> 00:12.825
They're all neurotransmitters which means it's affecting our nervous system.

00:13.543 --> 00:14.830
And yes, they're a little bit addicting.

00:15.457 --> 00:16.699
First, dopamine.

00:17.475 --> 00:19.211
Dopamine is part of the reward system.

00:19.552 --> 00:20.995
It makes you feel really happy.

00:21.365 --> 00:22.195
It's addictive too.

00:22.463 --> 00:23.151
You crave it.

00:23.503 --> 00:26.143
In this case, it makes you want to be with that person a lot.

00:26.491 --> 00:27.773
Next, serotonin.

00:28.154 --> 00:32.419
Serotonin helps us regulate appetite as well as mood and muscle contraction.

00:32.865 --> 00:35.614
It results in extra focus and compulsive thinking.

00:36.117 --> 00:39.130
Basically, it causes you to think about that person all the time.

00:40.451 --> 00:41.422
Finally, adrenaline.

00:41.929 --> 00:44.511
Adrenaline is released in the brain's adrenal gland.

00:44.797 --> 00:48.369
It circulates quickly in the blood and makes you focus on the task at hand,...

00:49.416 --> 00:51.258
...elevates your heart and makes you sweat.

00:52.243 --> 00:53.320
It's a stress molecule, right?

00:53.779 --> 00:55.436
And of course, the fight-or-flight drug.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.181
All right, now let's review.

00:57.877 --> 01:00.891
The feeling of love comes from the hormones released from your brain.

01:01.337 --> 01:03.764
These hormones affect your mood and actions.

01:04.185 --> 01:06.412
If you understand this, you'll make wiser decisions.

01:06.707 --> 01:10.042
For instance, scientists suggest not to make life-changing decisions...

01:10.167 --> 01:12.402
...when you're under the influence of love chemicals.

01:13.119 --> 01:13.943
So, there you have it.

01:14.690 --> 01:15.818
The chemistry of love.
