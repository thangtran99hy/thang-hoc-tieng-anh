00:03.672 --> 00:04.774
We heard it was lovely here.

00:05.515 --> 00:06.809
It's even better than we thought.

00:07.337 --> 00:07.975
You know what?

00:08.084 --> 00:09.161
It really was.

00:09.733 --> 00:12.117
It's so hard to think of one standout thing that we did.

00:15.329 --> 00:16.957
I think I like the scenery most.

00:18.259 --> 00:19.945
I thought it was sharing it with me.

00:20.876 --> 00:23.017
Well, obviously that was the best thing.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.731
That view was pretty good though.

00:26.451 --> 00:29.175
There's a few things we'd go back for, wouldn't you say?

00:29.452 --> 00:30.418
I'd say so.

00:30.605 --> 00:32.085
That surf was amazing.

00:32.613 --> 00:34.933
Well, it certainly wore you out anyway.

00:35.251 --> 00:39.411
And as for that final sunset, I felt like I was a million miles away.

00:39.968 --> 00:41.869
Good job it's only down the road then.
