As you spend the majority of your time with your coworkers,...

00:10.475 --> 00:12.189
...love is bound to flourish.

00:13.093 --> 00:15.962
Not only are you more aware of their personalities,...

00:16.636 --> 00:19.943
...but you have an established chemistry and lots in common.

00:21.063 --> 00:25.393
Here are some helpful tips on making sure love's labor's not lost.

00:26.506 --> 00:27.905
Avoid the boss.

00:28.305 --> 00:31.497
While dating a colleague is something you might be considering,...

00:32.042 --> 00:35.320
...going for your boss is something we cannot recommend.

00:36.333 --> 00:40.259
They may be attractive and just the type of person you've been searching for,...

00:40.727 --> 00:42.814
...but there could be serious fallout.

00:43.851 --> 00:46.729
You don't want every promotion or opportunity you're given...

00:47.015 --> 00:51.819
...to be waved off by your coworkers as simply a perk of going steady with the chief.

00:53.123 --> 00:54.794
Discretion is your friend.

00:55.629 --> 00:58.240
Yes, the gooey feeling of finding the right someone...

00:58.427 --> 01:02.871
...can make us want to grab a megaphone and connect it to an amp turned up to 11.

01:04.165 --> 01:07.243
But sometimes being discreet is the proper way to go.

01:07.874 --> 01:12.205
There may be some past romantic conflicts between colleagues that you are unaware of.

01:12.903 --> 01:17.433
And creating an environment of jealousy and resentment is something best avoided.

01:18.189 --> 01:21.125
Similarly, favoring your newly found friend...

01:21.399 --> 01:24.564
...could lead to political problems further down the line.

01:25.127 --> 01:27.836
Finally, keep your intentions honest.

01:28.699 --> 01:32.177
You don't want to get into something with the promise of it being serious...

01:32.470 --> 01:35.310
...if you're not quite ready for that level of commitment.

01:36.371 --> 01:40.076
Calling it off after a short run may be fine for you,...

01:40.630 --> 01:43.879
...but it could leave the other party confused and lost.

01:44.986 --> 01:50.113
Be honest from the start and you're bound to not only have a less stressful time,...

01:50.583 --> 01:55.711
...but in case it doesn't work out, the dark cloud of pure tension won't be an issue.
