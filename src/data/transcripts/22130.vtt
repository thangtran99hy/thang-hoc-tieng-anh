The Silk Road was the first true communications network...

00:04.051 --> 00:05.677
...that dates back 2,000 years.

00:06.137 --> 00:09.686
Its land route start from Xian, China to Istanbul, Turkey...

00:10.008 --> 00:11.457
...and then to Greece and Italy.

00:12.473 --> 00:13.907
My research begins at Xian.

00:14.451 --> 00:18.837
It's a land of diverse ethnic identities, and the Silk Road's eastern gateway.

00:22.808 --> 00:26.352
Like the Internet, information and ideas spread rapidly along it...

00:26.793 --> 00:29.634
...and this includes religious philosophy and teachings.

00:33.590 --> 00:39.021
As the story goes, a Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang traveled 17 arduous years to India...

00:39.189 --> 00:41.123
...in search of sacred Buddhist sutras.

00:41.591 --> 00:45.682
Upon his return, the sutras he had found were placed in this magnificent pagoda.

00:49.065 --> 00:53.673
Built in the 7th Century, the great mosque is one of the largest and best preserved.

00:54.532 --> 00:59.437
You'll be even surprised to find as I was that it's completely Chinese in its architecture.

01:06.183 --> 01:08.417
As I discover more about Xian and the Silk Road,...

01:08.955 --> 01:11.903
...I realize that it shares some qualities with the modern Internet.

01:13.020 --> 01:16.863
It's the first information highway where trade, art, and philosophy flourished.

01:17.409 --> 01:19.196
And in addition to commercial exchanges,...

01:19.560 --> 01:23.275
...it encouraged the historic multicultural exchange of epic proportions.
