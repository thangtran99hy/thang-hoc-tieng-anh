00:01.667 --> 00:02.542
ï»¿You need a machine.

00:05.860 --> 00:08.269
A machine that lives and breathes.

00:10.430 --> 00:11.804
Something you don't start.

00:14.218 --> 00:15.371
Something you awaken.

00:18.556 --> 00:19.312
Unleash...

00:23.168 --> 00:24.398
...and then believe in.

00:28.843 --> 00:30.061
Define the line...

00:32.264 --> 00:33.313
...to thread the needle.

00:34.315 --> 00:36.661
Something engineered to respond in an instant,...

00:38.023 --> 00:39.237
...to adapt and react.

00:41.433 --> 00:44.255
You need a machine so sharp,...

00:44.863 --> 00:51.412
...if you had to make a snap decision right now between heartbeats, it would deliver.

00:53.351 --> 00:54.777
Meet your machine.
