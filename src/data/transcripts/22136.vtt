Bread Day is a beautiful day.

00:03.200 --> 00:09.949
It is our opportunity to work with the children through song...

00:10.028 --> 00:12.450
...and the grains that grow in the fields.

00:12.781 --> 00:20.523
And so the children are actually taking part in the beginnings of a magical creation...

00:20.637 --> 00:22.681
...or a science experiment.

00:22.813 --> 00:24.134
They watch the yeast grow.

00:24.208 --> 00:25.264
How does that grow?

00:25.335 --> 00:25.933
What is that?

00:26.225 --> 00:27.307
Why does it do that?

00:27.547 --> 00:33.410
This is one of the ways in Waldorf education that we are teaching...

00:33.933 --> 00:39.939
...adult principles for later in life, for flexibility in thinking.

00:40.217 --> 00:45.788
And then once we have the dough, we gently roll it together.

00:45.915 --> 00:47.492
Each one makes a bun.

00:47.858 --> 00:53.116
In this, there's that opportunity to experience the life in that...

00:53.289 --> 00:58.233
...so that food is not an object but is an experience.

00:58.531 --> 01:04.068
And so we're taking part in the care of feeding our cozy cottage,...

01:05.099 --> 01:06.956
...which is what I call our kindergarten.

01:07.079 --> 01:11.176
We are really enjoying the love of each other...

01:11.278 --> 01:14.455
...and in rolling the bread and experiencing community.
