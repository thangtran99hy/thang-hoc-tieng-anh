ï»¿I've come to realize the greatest discoveries aren't out here.

00:11.761 --> 00:12.613
They're inside you.

00:16.514 --> 00:18.831
One of the shortfalls I think many people have...

00:19.049 --> 00:24.039
...is that they allow all these distractions and fears and doubts...

00:24.250 --> 00:26.923
...to get into their head and sabotage them.

00:32.209 --> 00:34.603
Is there a way to make that difficult thing...

00:35.563 --> 00:41.077
...a catalyst to moving on to something different...

00:43.869 --> 00:45.725
...rather than just allowing it to crush you?

00:50.053 --> 00:54.656
I'm one of 118 people in history to have reached the top of all Seven Summits.

00:59.147 --> 01:00.903
But I'm the only person to do it blind.

01:08.141 --> 01:09.359
I may not be able to see,...

01:11.035 --> 01:13.069
...but I could still show others what's possible.

01:13.878 --> 01:14.243
Hey, buddy.

01:14.511 --> 01:15.852
Thanks for carrying my bag out.
