Dating in the workplace is pretty common.

00:03.235 --> 00:06.421
You spend a lot of time together, have similar career interests...

00:06.803 --> 00:08.518
...and may even work on projects together.

00:09.347 --> 00:13.886
However, dating a coworker can create certain legal and professional challenges.

00:14.404 --> 00:17.173
Many employers forbid dating among coworkers,...

00:17.401 --> 00:20.250
...especially between supervisors and their subordinates,...

00:20.701 --> 00:22.951
...and they often have a legal right to do so.

00:23.575 --> 00:28.625
Workplace romances may result in a breach of confidentiality, reduced objectivity,...

00:29.117 --> 00:33.545
...slowed productivity, claims of preferential treatment, arguing on the job...

00:33.887 --> 00:36.128
...and even charges of sexual harassment.
