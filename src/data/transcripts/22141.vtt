ï»¿Is there anything more American than America?

00:22.217 --> 00:23.901
'Cause you can't import original.

00:26.493 --> 00:29.102
You can't fake true cool.

00:31.057 --> 00:32.746
You can't duplicate legacy.

00:36.837 --> 00:39.170
Because what Detroit created was a first...

00:39.881 --> 00:43.307
...and became an inspiration to the rest of the world.

00:46.115 --> 00:50.419
Yeah, Detroit made cars and cars made America.

00:52.701 --> 00:56.912
Making the best, making the finest takes conviction.

01:01.175 --> 01:06.913
And you can't import the heart and soul of every man and woman working on the lab.

01:09.311 --> 01:12.037
You could search the world over for the finer things,...

01:12.929 --> 01:17.527
...but you won't find a match for the American road and the creatures that live on it.

01:19.972 --> 01:23.125
Because we believe in the zoom and the roar and the thrust.

01:26.457 --> 01:27.855
And when it's made here,...

01:28.306 --> 01:35.521
...it's made with the one thing you can't import from anywhere else: American pride.

01:37.689 --> 01:39.290
So let Germany brew your beer.

01:41.134 --> 01:42.624
Let Switzerland make your watch.

01:43.955 --> 01:45.773
Let Asia assemble your phone.

01:51.031 --> 01:53.637
We will build your car.
