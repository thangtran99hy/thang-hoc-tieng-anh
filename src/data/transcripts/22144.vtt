Have you ever noticed how in Hollywood movies all the villains are played by Brits?

00:05.877 --> 00:07.039
Maybe we just sound right.

00:07.167 --> 00:07.881
Good evening, sir.

00:08.051 --> 00:08.759
Thank you, Mary.

00:16.925 --> 00:18.199
We're more focused.

00:19.910 --> 00:20.998
More precise.

00:21.153 --> 00:22.865
We're always one step ahead.

00:23.084 --> 00:24.671
With a certain style.

00:25.322 --> 00:26.498
An eye for detail.

00:27.822 --> 00:30.605
And we're obsessed by power.

00:40.131 --> 00:42.318
Stiff upper lip is key.

00:46.785 --> 00:48.518
And we all drive Jaguars.

00:54.835 --> 00:57.855
Oh yes, it's good to be bad.
