00:04.632 --> 00:06.232
They told me it couldn't be done.

00:07.003 --> 00:09.001
That I was a lost cause.

00:09.935 --> 00:14.038
I was picked on and picked last.

00:15.190 --> 00:16.877
Coaches didn't know how to talk to me.

00:21.165 --> 00:25.253
They gave up on me, told me I should just quit.

00:35.013 --> 00:36.295
They didn't call my name.

00:36.631 --> 00:38.066
Told me it was over.

00:39.245 --> 00:43.349
But I've been deaf since I was three so I didn't listen.

00:47.141 --> 00:51.927
And now I'm here, with the loudest fans in the NFL cheering me on,...

00:52.460 --> 00:54.060
...and I can hear them all.
