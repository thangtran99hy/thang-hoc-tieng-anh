We do get a piece of advice from a friend...

00:07.782 --> 00:09.947
...when we told them that we're gonna open Soul Cycle.

00:10.043 --> 00:12.577
And he said, you know, "I don't have the heart to tell you this,..."

00:12.659 --> 00:13.825
"...but you know spinning is dead.

00:14.228 --> 00:17.220
So, indoor cycling business is probably not a good idea.

00:17.951 --> 00:19.715
And we were like, "Well, I think we could still do it."

00:19.777 --> 00:20.947
"I think we could still reinvent it."

00:21.035 --> 00:23.809
"I think we can still create something that we want as the user."

00:23.888 --> 00:27.001
So people looked at us and said, "You're gonna charge what per class?"

00:27.078 --> 00:31.099
"And somebody could get that included in their gym membership for as much as they wanted?"

00:31.651 --> 00:35.498
But we really decided that pay per class model was a challenge to ourselves.

00:35.788 --> 00:39.877
We thought that if we charge each time people came that we will be challenging ourselves...

00:39.950 --> 00:42.940
...to create an incredible experience each and every time.

00:43.365 --> 00:45.871
And so we went for it and it worked out really well for us.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.737
There will always be naysayers around,...

00:48.159 --> 00:51.719
....and the truth is that when you put into act together with your gut,...

00:51.797 --> 00:52.465
...you're gonna get there.

00:52.713 --> 00:57.002
I think the lesson when people give you advice is that you need to trust your own instincts.

00:57.355 --> 00:59.003
You know your business best.
