00:06.870 --> 00:09.085
The world is full of giants.

00:13.166 --> 00:17.799
They have always been here, lumbering in the schoolyards,...

00:18.569 --> 00:20.173
...limping through the alleys.

00:21.161 --> 00:25.901
We had to learn how to deal with them, how to overcome them.

00:27.985 --> 00:31.519
We were small but fast, remember?

00:32.313 --> 00:34.855
We were like a wind appearing out of nowhere.

00:37.013 --> 00:39.426
We knew that being clever was more important...

00:39.660 --> 00:42.095
...than being the biggest kid in the neighborhood.

00:43.891 --> 00:48.521
As long as we keep our heads down, as long as we work hard,...

00:48.747 --> 00:53.665
...trust what we feel in our guts, our hearts, then we're ready.

00:54.901 --> 01:00.559
We wait until they get sleepy, wait until they get so big they can barely move,...

01:01.659 --> 01:09.479
...and then walk out of the shadows, quietly walk out of the dark and strike.
