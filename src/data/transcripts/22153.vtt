Hey Darcy, look! 100,000 miles.

00:04.577 --> 00:04.916
So?

00:06.183 --> 00:06.999
It's a big deal.

00:08.523 --> 00:11.511
What if I told you that every time a Volkswagen hits 100,000 miles...

00:11.917 --> 00:13.995
...a German engineer gets his wings.

00:42.147 --> 00:43.985
I hate these wingy thingies.

00:45.097 --> 00:48.804
Yeah dad, and I'm sure at 200,000 miles, rainbows shoot out of their butts.

00:54.226 --> 00:57.869
Volkswagen has the most vehicles on the road with over 100,000 miles.

00:58.151 --> 00:59.997
That's the power of German engineering.
