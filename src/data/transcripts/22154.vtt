ï»¿Tim Tebow here.

00:01.433 --> 00:05.217
Everyone thinks I want a contract, but without one, I've done so much this year.

00:05.449 --> 00:06.703
Nervous father's to Mike!

00:06.821 --> 00:07.868
Wide 20 in motion!

00:07.933 --> 00:08.601
Is that Tim Tebow?

00:08.685 --> 00:10.508
Wide 80 breathe, hut hut!

00:10.595 --> 00:11.316
Without a contract,...

00:11.400 --> 00:11.916
There he is.

00:12.060 --> 00:13.071
...I've tackled the unknown,...

00:15.036 --> 00:15.935
...worked on my delivery...

00:16.014 --> 00:18.607
I mean, talk about illegal use of the hands, right?

00:19.066 --> 00:20.391
...and improved my mental game.

00:22.541 --> 00:24.158
If I had a contract, could I do this?

00:26.382 --> 00:27.116
Gotcha.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.083
If I had a contract, I couldn't do my own stunts.

00:30.880 --> 00:31.969
Or save these puppies.

00:32.446 --> 00:33.189
If I had a contract,...

00:33.356 --> 00:35.757
...I wouldn't be with all you fine people tonight.

00:35.987 --> 00:37.878
You might wanna hold on to those doughnuts.

00:39.880 --> 00:40.977
I've accomplished so much.

00:44.863 --> 00:46.575
Even fulfilled a childhood dream.

00:48.963 --> 00:50.985
Bottom line, contracts hold you back.

00:51.407 --> 00:52.338
Am I right, Iceland?

00:52.663 --> 00:53.579
You know what I'm talking about.

00:53.867 --> 00:56.293
Switch to T-Mobile and we'll buy you out of yours.

00:58.840 --> 00:59.813
A little help?
