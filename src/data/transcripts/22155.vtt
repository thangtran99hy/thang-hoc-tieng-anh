ï»¿Great game, right?

00:02.367 --> 00:04.891
So you're probably expecting me to crash a car or blow something up.

00:05.685 --> 00:07.600
But really, I'm here to talk about car safety.

00:08.560 --> 00:09.078
Look around you.

00:09.814 --> 00:10.287
Who do you see?

00:11.198 --> 00:13.893
Friends, family, neighbors, all your loved ones.

00:14.440 --> 00:15.559
Everyone you care about.

00:16.861 --> 00:18.041
And here's what I want you to do.

00:18.873 --> 00:21.305
I want you to give each and every one of them a hug.

00:24.149 --> 00:24.498
I'll wait.

00:30.591 --> 00:31.108
Thank you.

00:32.227 --> 00:34.754
Those people you just hugged, they're real.

00:35.551 --> 00:36.937
They're not crash test dummies.

00:37.372 --> 00:38.659
They're not engineering data.

00:39.291 --> 00:41.969
And their safety matters as much to Honda as it matters to you.

00:42.886 --> 00:46.989
And it's why Honda builds more top safety rated cars in America than any other brand.

00:49.551 --> 00:50.601
You can let go now, friend.

00:53.777 --> 00:54.628
That's a great hug.

00:54.817 --> 00:55.413
Oh, thanks.

00:55.972 --> 00:56.387
Thank you.
