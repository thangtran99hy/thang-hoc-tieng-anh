Hi, I'm Naomi and I'm very excited to show you the world's greatest attractions.

00:11.088 --> 00:15.983
Sochi, on the coast of the Black Sea, is one of the warmer Russian cities.

00:16.624 --> 00:20.858
It is a beautiful place and an important spot for naval trade and traffic.

00:21.390 --> 00:23.621
It was in part to celebrate this fact,...

00:23.713 --> 00:27.489
...that the Sochi Maritime Terminal was built in 1955.

00:28.147 --> 00:31.007
The terminal's key feature is its tall spire...

00:31.230 --> 00:33.233
...nearly 235 feet tall.

00:33.963 --> 00:36.847
It also has four statues built around the tower.

00:37.173 --> 00:39.508
One for each of the cardinal directions.

00:40.162 --> 00:41.886
Located right on the water,...

00:42.025 --> 00:45.613
...the Sochi Maritime Terminal is a key landmark for the city.

00:46.795 --> 00:49.422
Thank you for watching our travel video series.

00:49.762 --> 00:50.709
See you next time.
