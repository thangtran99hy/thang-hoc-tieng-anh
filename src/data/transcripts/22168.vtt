ï»¿The importance of Black History Month is very simple.

00:03.219 --> 00:08.962
It's a time that we really need to reflect on the "where we've been" and "where we're going".

00:09.825 --> 00:12.487
It's a journey that we have all taken...

00:13.400 --> 00:16.232
...and we need to pass that on from generation to generation.

00:16.610 --> 00:22.357
So with every generation, we have that lovely message and history to pass on.

00:23.159 --> 00:25.707
And for those 28 days in February,...

00:26.019 --> 00:30.893
...we really must take that time to really pass the message on...

00:31.287 --> 00:37.273
...and pass the word of being proud of our heritage and where we've come from.

00:38.432 --> 00:43.261
And what better way to do it than to celebrate in every facet possible?

00:44.022 --> 00:47.635
Through poetry, through music, through dance, through theater.

00:48.435 --> 00:50.646
It's a really special, special time,...

00:51.267 --> 00:52.883
...and I'm so glad to be a part of it.

00:53.529 --> 00:57.009
As the spokesperson this year, I'm very, very proud.
