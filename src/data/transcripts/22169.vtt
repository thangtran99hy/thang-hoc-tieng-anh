The Cherry Tree Shopping Center in Scaggsville has a new tenant.

00:03.735 --> 00:07.806
Kelsey's Kloset offers secondhand designer clothes, accessories and handbags.

00:08.127 --> 00:10.550
People can bring their goods in to sell them for cash...

00:10.651 --> 00:13.009
...or come to shop for them at discount prices.

00:13.321 --> 00:16.679
The store started with Kelsey and her sisters' own gently used clothes...

00:16.940 --> 00:19.797
...and has grown in the nearly two months it's been open.

00:20.084 --> 00:21.970
The store is open seven days a week...

00:22.150 --> 00:24.951
...and there's a learning curve to running a small business, of course,...

00:25.273 --> 00:28.997
...but Kelsey is picking it up quickly because it's something she's passionate about.

00:29.519 --> 00:31.819
It's really hard, you live and you learn.

00:31.919 --> 00:36.427
So, as you make mistakes, you just get right back up and keep trying.

00:36.633 --> 00:39.956
Kelsey graduated at the age of 16 from an online high school...

00:40.030 --> 00:43.041
...in order to free herself up to start pursuing her dreams.

00:43.411 --> 00:46.470
She encourages any other young entrepreneur to do the same.

00:46.733 --> 00:52.495
I hope to open another Kelsey's Kloset somewhere in the future.
