An enduring myth says we use only 10% of our brain,...

00:03.505 --> 00:06.905
...the other 90% standing idly by for spare capacity.

00:07.487 --> 00:10.087
Hucksters promised to unlock that hidden potential...

00:10.388 --> 00:15.107
...with methods based on neuroscience, but all they really unlock is your wallet.

00:15.834 --> 00:21.293
Two-thirds of the public and nearly half of science teachers mistakenly believe the 10% myth.

00:21.759 --> 00:26.122
In the 1890s, William James, the father of American psychology, said,...

00:26.457 --> 00:28.604
..."Most of us do not meet our mental potential."

00:29.273 --> 00:33.106
James meant this as a challenge, not an indictment of scant brain usage.

00:33.539 --> 00:35.075
But the misunderstanding stuck.

00:35.621 --> 00:40.957
Also, scientists couldn't figure out for a long time the purpose of our massive frontal lobes...

00:41.216 --> 00:43.362
...or broad areas of the parietal lobe.

00:43.750 --> 00:46.422
Damage didn't cause motor or sensory deficits,...

00:46.761 --> 00:49.493
...so authorities concluded they didn't do anything.

00:50.216 --> 00:54.297
For decades, these parts were called silent areas, their function elusive.

00:54.737 --> 00:58.263
We've since learned that they underscore executive and integrative ability,...

00:58.631 --> 01:00.347
...without which we would hardly be human.

01:00.879 --> 01:04.231
They're crucial to abstract reasoning, planning, weighing decisions...

01:04.521 --> 01:06.779
...and flexibly adapting to circumstances.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.955
The idea that nine-tenths of your brain sits idly by in your skull...

01:11.192 --> 01:14.199
...looks silly when we calculate how the brain uses energy.

01:14.655 --> 01:18.909
Rodent and canine brains consume 5% of total body energy.

01:19.325 --> 01:20.777
Monkey brains use 10%.

01:21.306 --> 01:25.311
An adult human brain, which accounts for only 2% of the body's mass,...

01:25.606 --> 01:28.969
...consumes 20% of daily glucose burned.

01:29.437 --> 01:33.865
In children, that figure is 50% and in infants, 60%.

01:34.561 --> 01:37.584
This is far more than expected for their relative brain sizes,...

01:37.851 --> 01:39.799
...which scale in proportion to body size.

01:40.291 --> 01:46.171
Human ones weigh 1.5 kilograms, elephant brains 5 kilograms and whale brains 9 kilograms,...

01:46.434 --> 01:51.694
...yet on a per weight basis, humans pack in more neurons than any other species.

01:52.046 --> 01:54.533
This dense packing is what makes us so smart.
