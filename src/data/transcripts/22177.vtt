00:00.151 --> 00:01.353
We're all getting old.

00:01.849 --> 00:03.209
Yes, even you.

00:04.086 --> 00:06.415
More and more of our population are over sixty,...

00:06.705 --> 00:08.459
...some living well into their nineties.

00:09.275 --> 00:14.089
And as we live longer, our joints, organs and tissues begin to fail,...

00:14.993 --> 00:17.367
...thereby diminishing the quality of our old age,...

00:17.932 --> 00:23.002
...not to mention the societal cost of lost productivity and long-term care.

00:23.771 --> 00:27.874
Our current medical technologies allow for extraordinary feats...

00:27.994 --> 00:34.807
...of augmentation and replacement: transplantation, pacemakers and artificial joints.

00:36.179 --> 00:38.689
Regenerative medicine goes further,...

00:39.073 --> 00:43.995
...promising the repair of dysfunctional body parts with our own living tissue.

00:44.771 --> 00:46.509
Many species can regenerate.

00:46.975 --> 00:51.305
A salamander can regrow its limbs, tail and even its eye.

00:53.290 --> 00:58.412
But sadly, only a few bits of us, like a healthy liver, can perform that trick.

00:58.956 --> 01:02.490
Coaxing the rest of our body to do it requires more effort.

01:02.899 --> 01:09.163
3D-printed biomaterial scaffolds coated with layers of the patient's cells...

01:09.520 --> 01:11.575
...and cooked up in a body-mimicking oven...

01:11.817 --> 01:15.692
...can produce viable veins, bladders and bone.

01:16.235 --> 01:20.167
And more complex organs like kidneys aren't far away.
