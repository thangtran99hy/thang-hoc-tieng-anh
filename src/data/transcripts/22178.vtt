00:04.295 --> 00:06.247
What I would say, "Relax and don't be so driven."

00:06.347 --> 00:07.804
"Enjoy the journey a little bit more."

00:08.631 --> 00:09.759
Secondly, I would say,...

00:09.871 --> 00:12.579
"Find what you love and do that because you're gonna be successful doing it."

00:12.660 --> 00:13.271
Be patient.

00:14.955 --> 00:15.547
Hang in there.

00:15.973 --> 00:17.527
Keep doing the things that matter.

00:18.839 --> 00:19.923
It will pay off in the long run.

00:20.087 --> 00:20.841
Lose some weight.

00:22.067 --> 00:23.441
Probably relax a little bit,...

00:24.435 --> 00:25.199
...but not too much.

00:25.329 --> 00:26.243
You're 25.

00:26.623 --> 00:28.609
You know, take a chance and don't be afraid to do that.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.216
You know, you go to school and you bury yourself in debt.

00:31.683 --> 00:34.573
There's nothing wrong with taking a chance on starting your business.

00:34.825 --> 00:36.253
Keep going, you're doing pretty good.

00:36.396 --> 00:39.162
Grow a few more inches, gain a few more pounds...

00:39.349 --> 00:41.156
...and try to make it in the NFL.
