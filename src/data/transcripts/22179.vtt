00:07.640 --> 00:11.060
Most of the Intelligence Community doesn't believe he exists.

00:13.493 --> 00:15.945
But ones who do call him, "The Winter Soldier".

00:18.278 --> 00:19.181
He's a ghost.

00:20.774 --> 00:22.147
You'll never find him.

00:30.777 --> 00:32.485
I joined S.H.I.E.L.D. to protect people.

00:35.249 --> 00:40.091
Captain, to build a better world, sometimes means tearing the old one down...

00:40.660 --> 00:41.742
...and that makes enemies.

00:52.777 --> 01:00.803
He's fast, strong; had a metal arm.

01:06.133 --> 01:06.923
Are you ready?

01:07.674 --> 01:09.217
All it takes is one step.

01:10.284 --> 01:11.313
People are gonna die.

01:13.051 --> 01:14.110
I can't let that happen.

01:16.202 --> 01:17.973
Captain America needs my help.

01:21.333 --> 01:22.307
When do we start?

01:23.147 --> 01:23.829
We just did.

01:34.585 --> 01:36.245
The price of freedom is high.

01:38.089 --> 01:39.772
And it's a price I'm willing to pay.

01:42.704 --> 01:44.133
You told me not to trust anyone.

01:45.536 --> 01:46.595
This is how it ends.

01:46.799 --> 01:47.867
Everything goes.

01:55.401 --> 01:57.455
It looks like you're giving the orders now, Captain.

01:58.180 --> 01:58.961
Damn right.

02:11.997 --> 02:13.759
How do we know the good guys from the bad guys?

02:14.111 --> 02:15.519
If they're shooting at you, they're bad.
