00:01.266 --> 00:04.787
If there is ever a case to be made for self-education, it's Lincoln.

00:05.269 --> 00:07.919
He's like the antithesis of the advertisement for your college.

00:08.233 --> 00:11.193
He taught himself the Bible, he taught himself Shakespeare,...

00:11.884 --> 00:14.496
...he memorized Euclid's geometry.

00:14.597 --> 00:16.837
This was a guy who had no background in the military,...

00:16.934 --> 00:20.892
...but when he got to Washington as president, he quickly read books on strategy...

00:21.137 --> 00:25.062
...and grasped ideas that the generals who were trained at West Point didn't have.

00:25.215 --> 00:26.041
I don't know how he did it.

00:26.157 --> 00:31.107
I don't know how a mind could be that sharp and that open to new ideas....

00:31.241 --> 00:33.920
...when you're in your fifties, but he was clearly extraordinary.

00:35.050 --> 00:38.811
Lincoln had an enormous ability to concentrate, much to the annoyance of his wife.

00:38.982 --> 00:43.013
So when she called for dinner or said someone's at the door, he was still reading.

00:43.253 --> 00:44.471
He also read out loud,...

00:44.753 --> 00:48.562
...which is the way he told people that things got cemented into his memory.

00:48.845 --> 00:51.498
Another area that must have tortured a lot of people around him.

00:52.216 --> 00:54.811
He could read in a law office that was busy.

00:55.470 --> 00:56.621
He could read at home.

00:57.510 --> 01:01.164
Even with his kids climbing all over him, I guess you gotta have that.

01:03.530 --> 01:07.959
Probably the most amazing thing about Lincoln is not only that he advocated opportunity,...

01:08.172 --> 01:09.973
...but that he lived the American dream.

01:10.061 --> 01:12.578
He almost created it and came to symbolize it.

01:13.721 --> 01:20.003
The idea that you could rise from a log cabin to the White House was new in America.

01:20.469 --> 01:22.043
William Henry Harrison had done it,...

01:22.344 --> 01:23.704
...but Harrison was also a general.

01:24.111 --> 01:27.774
He got himself trained in the army and he was a slave owner.

01:28.337 --> 01:31.907
So he didn't understand that the opportunity to rise...

01:32.344 --> 01:35.136
...should be extended to black people as well as white people.

01:35.440 --> 01:37.095
Lincoln was the first to understand that.

01:37.482 --> 01:40.714
The first to care about education even if he had no access to it.

01:41.239 --> 01:43.783
The first to believe that opportunity was universal...

01:43.893 --> 01:46.164
...and people of any color had the right to it.

01:46.761 --> 01:48.051
And I think he became a great symbol.
