I know you've heard about the new hand-tossed pizza from Pizza Hut.

00:02.917 --> 00:05.087
It is good to the last, garlic, buttery bite.

00:05.567 --> 00:09.711
In case you need to save a little for later and reheating pizza is your thing as it should be,...

00:10.156 --> 00:12.458
...make sure you check out the new instructions on their new box.

00:12.573 --> 00:13.828
I will read them for you now.

00:14.270 --> 00:17.233
Number one: preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

00:17.677 --> 00:19.271
This is very important.

00:19.680 --> 00:24.233
Number two: remove the pizza from the box 'cause otherwise at 350 degrees the box...

00:26.069 --> 00:29.519
Number three: resist picking off the toppings if you can.

00:30.080 --> 00:30.783
And I can't.

00:31.349 --> 00:34.517
Number four: transfer the cheesy goodness to the baking sheet.

00:35.195 --> 00:38.291
Number five: bake for 5 to 10 minutes.

00:38.630 --> 00:40.793
Spend time reflecting on your life, like this.

00:44.506 --> 00:48.226
Number six: remove from oven and are you seriously still reading this?

00:48.557 --> 00:49.030
Let's eat.

00:49.886 --> 00:50.560
That's fun.

00:51.055 --> 00:51.945
Go for greatness people.
