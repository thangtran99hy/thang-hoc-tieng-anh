I'm Caroline Moore and I'm a junior at Warwick Valley High School in Warwick, New York.

00:07.992 --> 00:11.562
Since I was a little girl, I've always been curious about the world around me...

00:11.997 --> 00:15.129
...and I think that definitely plays a big part in my interest in astronomy.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.100
It's a hobby I share with my Dad.

00:18.584 --> 00:21.952
When she got more and more involved, I decided to build an observatory,...

00:22.475 --> 00:25.359
...where we could have all the equipment permanently mounted and start observing.

00:27.017 --> 00:29.219
So, I'm what they call a supernova hunter.

00:29.612 --> 00:33.403
I take pictures of the night sky and I scan them looking for noticeable changes.

00:34.686 --> 00:36.687
One night, I was looking at some images...

00:37.107 --> 00:40.074
...and I came across something that looked kind of interesting.

00:40.439 --> 00:43.629
So, that's when I Googled the galaxy to see what I could find.

00:44.885 --> 00:46.035
After searching for a while,...

00:46.117 --> 00:48.937
...I realized that I might have discovered my first supernova.

00:50.278 --> 00:53.629
So, I sent it into the International Astronomical Union.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.741
And it was late one evening, and a friend of ours called up...

00:56.843 --> 00:58.695
...and said he needed to speak to Caroline...

00:59.374 --> 01:01.577
...and then he broke the news to her that she had discovered...

01:01.662 --> 01:04.795
...and become the youngest person ever to discover a supernova.

01:05.652 --> 01:08.963
And I would just start jumping up and down, screaming and everything.

01:09.085 --> 01:09.599
It was great.

01:09.905 --> 01:13.620
I would just come in to school and kids would chant, "Supernova, supernova!"

01:14.189 --> 01:15.886
So yeah, I'm very proud.

01:16.072 --> 01:17.563
But again, a little jealousy.

01:17.905 --> 01:19.227
There's competition between us.

01:19.643 --> 01:22.079
He's out in the observatory every night, too...

01:22.390 --> 01:24.451
...so I definitely need to find another one.
