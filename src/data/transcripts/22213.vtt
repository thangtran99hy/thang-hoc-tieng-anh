00:03.193 --> 00:08.036
In my classroom, I'll grasp onto any technology that can expand the kids' possibilities.

00:08.193 --> 00:12.325
Learning comes from a teacher that's willing to take a risk and do something new...

00:12.417 --> 00:14.159
...and bring in these powerful tools.

00:14.275 --> 00:19.078
One of the key tools we're using right now is Skype to connect with other classrooms.

00:19.203 --> 00:22.371
It's so powerful to connect them beyond these four walls.

00:22.448 --> 00:27.829
Mystery Skype is a chance for the kids to connect with other students around the world.

00:27.915 --> 00:29.412
It's a challenging game for them.

00:29.516 --> 00:30.568
They have to critically think.

00:30.681 --> 00:31.744
Are you in the US?

00:31.845 --> 00:32.654
No, we're not.

00:32.991 --> 00:34.664
Are you somewhere in Mexico?

00:34.767 --> 00:35.381
Yes.

00:35.676 --> 00:38.031
It's a powerful tool to see kids learning from each other.

00:38.253 --> 00:42.385
To see their critical thinking process is far better than any test I could give them.

00:42.775 --> 00:45.527
I mean, really, it takes a team to do anything in life...

00:45.686 --> 00:48.071
...and it's a chance for them to experience that collaboration.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.571
Are you in Baja California?

00:49.655 --> 00:50.338
No.

00:50.410 --> 00:51.705
Are you in Mexico City?

00:52.354 --> 00:53.001
Yes, we are.

00:56.111 --> 00:58.725
Great game!
