ï»¿John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr.

00:06.363 --> 00:11.391
Together they form The Beatles, perhaps the greatest rock band ever.

00:11.913 --> 00:16.796
Fans emulated their style from the Beatle cut to their ever evolving wardrobe.

00:17.739 --> 00:21.391
But it was their music that will capture generations around the world.

00:22.798 --> 00:27.099
The Beatles would help shape the decade of the 60s like no other band before them...

00:27.835 --> 00:30.969
...and possibly since they arrived on the worldwide stage...

00:31.509 --> 00:34.555
...some 50 years ago in late 1963.

00:36.472 --> 00:38.475
But The Beatles didn't gain fame overnight.

00:38.889 --> 00:43.374
In fact, they endured numerous rejections before they broke through.

00:43.905 --> 00:46.673
The Beatles persevered and would eventually be signed...

00:46.744 --> 00:51.466
...to EMI studio's Parlophone Record label in May of 1962.

00:52.183 --> 00:55.836
They created a small ripple with their first single released that October.

00:56.964 --> 01:01.464
"Love Me Do" was not a major hit initially but their next single was.

01:02.706 --> 01:06.968
Released in January 1963 and the title of their first album,...

01:07.987 --> 01:10.995
..."Please, Please Me" was The Beatles first number one hit.

01:12.457 --> 01:17.643
In autumn of that same year, following performances at the London Palladium...

01:18.142 --> 01:20.421
...and then later at the Royal Command Performance,...

01:21.159 --> 01:23.174
...a full-blown virus would break out.

01:23.799 --> 01:27.685
In this case, it was Beatlemania that would infect millions.

01:28.381 --> 01:31.467
But while millions across Europe were under the spell of The Beatles,...

01:32.102 --> 01:33.255
...it would take a little longer...

01:33.349 --> 01:36.531
...before the band would encounter success across the Atlantic.

01:37.765 --> 01:42.187
And when "I Want To Hold Your Hand" reached the airwaves in late December 1963,...

01:42.891 --> 01:45.677
...The Beatles were on their way to conquering the US.

01:46.222 --> 01:49.052
50 years after bursting on the worldwide scene...

01:49.445 --> 01:51.603
...and over 40 years after their breakup,...

01:52.403 --> 01:56.630
...The Beatles and their music continue to bring in new generations of fans.

01:57.113 --> 01:59.683
Why does their music continue to strike a chord?

02:00.498 --> 02:05.463
People today are absolutely convinced without a doubt...

02:05.973 --> 02:09.721
...that there's no group in the history of the music,...

02:09.909 --> 02:13.608
...music as we know it, that ever has provided such a rage.

02:14.114 --> 02:19.442
They were all these tremendous personalities that attracted us and kept us interested.

02:20.054 --> 02:25.492
And you couple that with their great experimentation as a group...

02:26.497 --> 02:31.328
...that had this fantastic influence on subsequent bands.

02:31.928 --> 02:34.926
You put that all together and you just have this irresistible force.
