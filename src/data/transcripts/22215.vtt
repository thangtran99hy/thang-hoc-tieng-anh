Hi, my name is Jason Richelson.

00:10.023 --> 00:12.580
I'm the CEO of Shopkeep and we're here at One Girl Cookies...

00:12.681 --> 00:14.943
...talking about Valentine's Day Tips.

00:15.568 --> 00:17.383
Tip number one is start early.

00:18.043 --> 00:21.836
Start running reports from your point of sales system to see what you sold last year...

00:21.910 --> 00:25.329
...to make sure that this year you have just enough but not too much.

00:25.806 --> 00:29.173
Also remember, Valentine's Day is on Friday this year...

00:29.256 --> 00:31.929
...so you have a full week of sales, so be prepared.

00:33.257 --> 00:34.997
Tip number two is be original.

00:35.508 --> 00:38.902
Try and sell new and different products so that you can be selling on value...

00:38.990 --> 00:40.613
...instead of competing on price.

00:40.977 --> 00:43.618
That's how you can set yourself apart from the competition.

00:45.189 --> 00:48.627
Tip number three is also to start early with your customers.

00:48.957 --> 00:53.589
Use that all-important e-mail list, your Twitter feed and your Facebook page...

00:53.871 --> 00:56.253
...to make sure you're letting customers know what kind of products...

00:56.337 --> 00:57.975
...you're gonna have for Valentine's Day...

00:58.179 --> 01:00.701
...so that they're prepared and know what to come look for.

01:02.287 --> 01:05.881
Tip number four is to offer a really great in-store experience.

01:06.215 --> 01:08.423
You should have sections set up for him or her...

01:08.712 --> 01:10.832
...so that customers can quickly find what they need.

01:11.847 --> 01:14.206
Tip number five is to work with your neighbors.

01:14.325 --> 01:18.435
Work with some stores on your street or in your neighborhood to help bundle products.

01:18.594 --> 01:20.483
Maybe you sell some of their products in your store...

01:20.583 --> 01:22.413
...and they sell some of your products in their store.

01:22.745 --> 01:25.429
It can make for an interesting changeup for Valentine's Day.
