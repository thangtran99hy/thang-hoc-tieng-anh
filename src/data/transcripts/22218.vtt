You know, this business of ours is an exciting business.

00:05.706 --> 00:08.299
And one of the core things that we've got to realize...

00:08.415 --> 00:11.247
...is that this business does not really respect tradition.

00:12.029 --> 00:15.397
What it respects is innovation on a "go forward" basis.

00:15.759 --> 00:22.500
So it's really our collective challenge that we now need to make Microsoft thrive...

00:22.667 --> 00:25.264
...in a mobile first and a cloud first world.

00:25.589 --> 00:29.017
That's the core challenge that we collectively have to face up to.

00:29.236 --> 00:33.022
And I cannot be more honored, more humbled and more excited...

00:33.129 --> 00:34.834
...about Microsoft and our opportunity.

00:35.015 --> 00:35.436
Thank you all.
