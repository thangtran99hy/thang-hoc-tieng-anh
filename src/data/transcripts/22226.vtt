Satya, let me start by asking you, "Who is Satya Nadella?"

00:03.791 --> 00:05.021
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

00:05.865 --> 00:10.707
I'm 46 years old; I've been at Microsoft for 22 of those 46 years.

00:10.786 --> 00:14.371
I've been married for 22 years to a wife I've known ever since high school.

00:14.455 --> 00:15.567
We have three kids.

00:16.096 --> 00:23.572
Like anyone else, my experience and how I think, have all been shaped by my life's experience.

00:23.644 --> 00:27.442
And the one thing that I would say that defines me is, I love to learn.

00:28.227 --> 00:29.761
I get excited about new things.

00:30.193 --> 00:33.385
I buy more books than I read or finish.

00:34.245 --> 00:38.153
I sign up for more online courses than I can actually finish.

00:38.283 --> 00:42.163
But the thing about being able to watch people do great things,...

00:42.429 --> 00:45.411
...learn new concepts, is something that truly excites me.

00:46.311 --> 00:51.375
Now, CEO of Microsoft, tell me, tell us, why did you want this role?

00:52.202 --> 00:56.535
It's a question I asked myself very deeply when the opportunity came up.

00:57.495 --> 01:04.832
And when I think about the core of why I'm here, it is about impact.

01:06.633 --> 01:11.686
And in a software-powered world, what's a better place than Microsoft...

01:11.870 --> 01:17.046
...in terms of being able to take all of this human potential that we have...

01:17.169 --> 01:20.715
...in 100 and 130, soon to be 130,000 people,...

01:21.593 --> 01:26.414
...and apply it to a world that's rapidly becoming more software-driven.

01:26.925 --> 01:29.564
And the opportunity is what fundamentally drives me...

01:29.675 --> 01:32.517
...and got me to take this, raise my hand for this job.
