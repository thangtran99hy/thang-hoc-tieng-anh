00:03.068 --> 00:03.739
You.

00:04.983 --> 00:05.733
Your smile.

00:06.459 --> 00:07.096
Your eyes.

00:07.707 --> 00:10.616
Your stubborn curl that you got from your dad...

00:11.038 --> 00:12.363
...and that he got from his mom.

00:13.089 --> 00:16.700
How you look like when you listen to me and when you're trying to ignore me.

00:17.519 --> 00:21.400
The way you laugh about bad jokes and hide yourself when you're sad.

00:23.702 --> 00:29.715
The way you look before you kiss me and when you say, "I love you."

00:30.335 --> 00:33.617
You have really strict principles but only to drop them.

00:36.161 --> 00:41.602
And in your wonderful world, order and chaos is no contradiction at all.

00:43.563 --> 00:46.485
I've known you for so many years, but still you surprise me.

00:48.861 --> 00:51.482
Every morning, you really test my nerves.

01:06.928 --> 01:08.961
For all of that, I love you.
