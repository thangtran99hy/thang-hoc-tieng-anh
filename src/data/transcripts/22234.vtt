The athletes of today are not only much better than those of the past,...

00:07.500 --> 00:09.189
...they also look incredibly different.

00:09.396 --> 00:10.749
The weird thing is, scientists note...

00:11.000 --> 00:14.504
...that the human body hasn't evolved that dramatically in the past 100 years.

00:14.780 --> 00:16.971
So why do Olympic athletes look so different now...

00:17.264 --> 00:19.830
...compared to the first Winter Olympics in 1924?

00:20.081 --> 00:24.413
In the early 1900s, the ideal athlete was based on classical human proportions.

00:24.853 --> 00:26.953
If we imagine body types distributed as a bell curve...

00:27.400 --> 00:29.035
...with extreme body types being on the far ends,...

00:29.407 --> 00:32.500
...it was the middle of the curve that was considered the best physical build.

00:32.850 --> 00:37.000
Athletes who are not too tall but not too short, not too bulky but not too skinny,...

00:37.394 --> 00:40.500
...and well, average were deemed as ideal for the Olympic pursuit.

00:40.929 --> 00:41.900
But this has all changed.

00:42.304 --> 00:45.199
Now athletes succeed based on their highly specialized body types,...

00:45.301 --> 00:48.171
...which allow them to excel in a world of growing competitiveness.

00:48.496 --> 00:51.000
For example, athletes who are required to spin in the air,...

00:51.361 --> 00:54.200
...such as figure skaters or gymnasts, have been getting smaller.

00:54.519 --> 00:59.125
These athletes with short specialized body types have an advantage over average or tall athletes,...

00:59.425 --> 01:00.600
...weeding them out at the elite level.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.273
In fact in 30 years, the average professional gymnast has shrunk from 5'3" to 4'9".
