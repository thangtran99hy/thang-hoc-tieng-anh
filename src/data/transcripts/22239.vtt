00:07.159 --> 00:11.109
Well, there've been a lot but I can come up with one that,...

00:11.669 --> 00:15.477
...if there's time I can just go through it and let you know how I got into it...

00:15.562 --> 00:16.405
...and how I got out of it.

00:16.861 --> 00:18.136
It was definitely challenging.

00:19.364 --> 00:24.757
One of the things that I've tried to do all my life, it was one of my life goals...

00:24.840 --> 00:27.195
...was to be become a master instrument pilot...

00:28.177 --> 00:32.954
...and that's all; I loved flying on instruments, everything about it.

00:33.387 --> 00:35.465
And I used to do quite a bit of it.

00:36.933 --> 00:41.770
One time, coming back on a trip from the Bay Area to LA at night,...

00:42.308 --> 00:45.279
...I ran into a thunderstorm at night so you can't see.

00:45.370 --> 00:46.597
I was just in clouds.

00:46.975 --> 00:47.899
And then wham!

00:48.331 --> 00:53.661
I was just in a reciprocating airplane so it's probably only at 11, 12, 13,000 feet,...

00:53.739 --> 00:54.864
...I couldn't tell you the altitude.

00:55.516 --> 00:58.428
And I hit this thing and it just slammed the heck out of the airplane.

00:58.728 --> 01:02.751
But it caused my artificial horizon, which is the reference...

01:02.830 --> 01:06.097
...you use to stay level and to turn;...

01:06.399 --> 01:11.513
...it caused that thing to actually break and I lost my horizon reference.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.446
And it happened semi slowly.

01:15.931 --> 01:18.310
And as I watched the other instruments,...

01:18.373 --> 01:20.784
...you just kind of watched the instruments as a group...

01:21.285 --> 01:24.233
...and you see things going on and you put it together in your head.

01:25.076 --> 01:29.453
This is the all original, what I call "steam gauge instruments"; just dials basically.

01:29.841 --> 01:31.723
But you learn to put it together in your head...

01:32.161 --> 01:36.022
...and I realized that I had rolled the airplane upside down following that bad thing...

01:36.389 --> 01:40.504
...and I was starting to come out like this which was gonna cost me a lot of altitude.

01:41.283 --> 01:43.125
But I remember my dad's saying.

01:43.458 --> 01:44.284
What did he say?

01:44.758 --> 01:46.884
Needle, ball, and airspeed.

01:47.789 --> 01:50.483
Needle meaning get the left, right corrected first.

01:50.593 --> 01:52.146
Don't worry if you're headed for the ground.

01:52.409 --> 01:54.802
The ball, get it straightened out from slipping.

01:56.509 --> 01:57.947
And then correct your airspeed.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.421
What a lot of people try to do is they see the airspeed,...

02:00.503 --> 02:03.795
...increasing the horse back on the wheel while they're on a tight turn,...

02:03.873 --> 02:05.434
...they pull the wings right off the airplane.

02:05.860 --> 02:09.443
So I remember I said, "I'm either gonna get out of this"...

02:09.511 --> 02:12.837
..."or I'm gonna hit the ground trying but I'm gonna break the airplane."

02:12.982 --> 02:14.575
I just remembered that going through my head.

02:14.961 --> 02:16.391
Needle, ball,...

02:16.631 --> 02:18.829
Oh, I reached up and closed the throttles right away.

02:19.705 --> 02:21.348
Needle, ball, airspeed.

02:21.844 --> 02:25.804
And as I pulled out, I was going exactly the opposite direction...

02:26.409 --> 02:28.509
...2,000 feet below where I started.

02:30.103 --> 02:33.724
You learn to fly on what's called "partial panel"; without that primary instrument,...

02:34.175 --> 02:36.701
...the needle, the ball, and the airspeed is all you have...

02:36.941 --> 02:38.920
...and you learn to fly instruments on that alone.

02:39.032 --> 02:42.799
That's one of the skills that a really good instrument pilot has.

02:43.710 --> 02:46.504
I'd learned that as a young boy from my dad.

02:48.286 --> 02:51.260
Then I got control of the airplane and talked to air traffic control.
