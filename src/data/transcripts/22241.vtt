00:35.344 --> 00:39.219
Wow, that guy is very attractive. Oh, too bad. He's taken.

00:41.413 --> 00:45.672
That's too bad. I'm glad I'm not in his class.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.680
I'm very disappointed. You're in the penalty box.

00:53.833 --> 00:58.411

01:18.280 --> 01:21.713
"That's all? That's it? There's gotta be more, right?"

01:24.919 --> 01:29.946
It's a pity that this beautiful garden has been deserted like this.
