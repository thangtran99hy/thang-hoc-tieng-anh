ï»¿Texting, sharing photos, instant messaging.

00:14.713 --> 00:17.149
This is how so many of today's kids socialize.

00:17.705 --> 00:23.652
But they can also use these digital tools to threaten, gang up on and cyber bully other kids.

00:24.704 --> 00:27.023
What you may not realize about cyberbullying...

00:27.345 --> 00:30.167
...is that it's not always just one bully and one victim.

00:30.720 --> 00:33.409
Often, many other kids are present too.

00:34.051 --> 00:35.469
Some stand by silently.

00:35.895 --> 00:39.153
Some join in and some may even stand up for the bully.

00:40.117 --> 00:43.125
Experts say that kids standing up for other kids...

00:43.295 --> 00:46.463
...is one of the single most powerful ways to stop cyberbullying.

00:46.847 --> 00:49.821
So how can you help your kids learn to be upstanders?

00:50.856 --> 00:52.521
First, teach respect.

00:53.011 --> 00:55.851
Kids' online communication is often purposely vague.

00:56.414 --> 01:01.967
Your best bet is to teach them how to text, IM and post respectfully and responsibly.

01:02.598 --> 01:04.874
And if they say something inappropriate online,...

01:05.362 --> 01:07.982
...then make sure that they apologize immediately.

01:08.533 --> 01:10.431
Second, encourage empathy.

01:11.200 --> 01:14.933
Ask your kids to put themselves in another person's shoes.

01:15.538 --> 01:18.055
If they can understand what someone else is going through,...

01:18.493 --> 01:21.237
...then they're far less likely to bully another person...

01:21.609 --> 01:24.003
...or to watch quietly as others get bullied.

01:24.624 --> 01:26.382
Finally, tell them to speak up.

01:27.467 --> 01:30.696
Encourage your kids to let an adult know what's actually happening.

01:31.271 --> 01:33.651
If they don't feel comfortable confiding in you,...

01:34.203 --> 01:38.861
...then let them know that they can also talk to a teacher or any other trusted adult.

01:39.371 --> 01:43.465
The bottom line is to never say or never do something online...

01:43.595 --> 01:46.721
...or in a text message that you wouldn't say or do in person.
