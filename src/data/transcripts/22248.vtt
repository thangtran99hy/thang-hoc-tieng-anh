People say that there's nothing left to discover in this world,...

00:03.356 --> 00:05.058
...but there are new species to be discovered,...

00:05.155 --> 00:06.790
...lost worlds to be found.

00:07.010 --> 00:10.084
We concentrate so much on thinking about going into space,...

00:10.397 --> 00:14.456
...and yet, on our doorstep, there's pockets of habitat that hardly anyone has been to.

00:14.621 --> 00:17.307
I was working on an isolated mountain in Malawi,...

00:17.447 --> 00:20.699
...and I noticed there were similar mountains over the border in Mozambique.

00:20.849 --> 00:22.615
There was nothing written about these mountains.

00:23.235 --> 00:27.859
So when I returned to the UK, I was able to see Mount Mulanje in southern Malawi,...

00:28.100 --> 00:29.535
...which is a site I knew very well.

00:30.585 --> 00:33.224
I was then able to look across northern Mozambique.

00:33.781 --> 00:37.819
And then as I zoomed in, I saw this dark green patch suddenly emerge.

00:38.300 --> 00:41.574
That was tremendously exciting because this could be a lost rainforest.

00:48.976 --> 00:51.484
When you enter into a forest, everything changes.

00:51.825 --> 00:53.680
Life is buzzing all around you.

00:53.879 --> 00:55.196
Look at the size of the trees.

00:56.447 --> 01:00.265
We've discovered approximately 12 new species from Mount Mabu.

01:01.055 --> 01:02.825
This is Nadzikambia baylissi.

01:03.185 --> 01:05.237
I was lucky enough to find the first one of these.

01:07.279 --> 01:10.736
The knowledge information that we could benefit from as humankind...

01:11.000 --> 01:12.751
...could be sitting here all around us.

01:14.505 --> 01:16.251
You're always asking questions.

01:16.659 --> 01:19.879
As soon as you think you have the answers to the new questions, new doors open.

01:20.665 --> 01:21.724
That's the beauty of life.
