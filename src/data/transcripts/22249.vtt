The DIY aspects of skateboarding started from day one.

00:04.264 --> 00:07.687
So I entered a competition for a three-month lease on a piece of land in East London.

00:08.415 --> 00:09.323
After I won the project,...

00:09.419 --> 00:12.669
...I suddenly realized I had no budget and only four weeks to build it.

00:13.731 --> 00:17.297
I threw away a job in engineering and started all again to have a go at this.

00:19.915 --> 00:20.691
Welcome to Frontside.

00:21.109 --> 00:24.014
We've got the main sort of street course on this left here.

00:24.148 --> 00:26.625
The white boards are from a local art exhibition.

00:26.724 --> 00:29.342
The ply we managed to get from McGrath's around the corner.

00:31.275 --> 00:34.267
Standing in the park now watching it well-used is a massive buzz.

00:34.789 --> 00:35.759
I love the vibes here.

00:35.856 --> 00:37.511
This is where we spend most of our days at.

00:37.957 --> 00:41.217
We think this place is amazing considering it's all built by hand and stuff.

00:41.725 --> 00:43.305
Yeah, the skate park's only temporary.

00:43.533 --> 00:45.389
I just hope that some of the things the kids have learned...

00:45.498 --> 00:48.349
...and some of the memories they've got are a little bit more permanent.
