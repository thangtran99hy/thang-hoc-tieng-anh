00:00.839 --> 00:02.116
It's not about the shoes,...

00:07.427 --> 00:08.869
...it's about knowing where you are going,...

00:10.377 --> 00:11.954
...not forgetting where you started.

00:17.521 --> 00:19.323
It's about having the courage to fail,...

00:22.700 --> 00:25.011
...not breaking when you're broken,...

00:26.507 --> 00:31.706
...taking everything you have been given and making something better.

00:33.746 --> 00:38.045
It's about work before glory...

00:40.321 --> 00:41.580
...and what's inside of you.

00:43.079 --> 00:45.249
It's doing what they say you can't.

00:46.951 --> 00:51.281
It's not about the shoes, it's about what you do in them.

00:52.123 --> 00:56.226
It's about being who you were born to be.
