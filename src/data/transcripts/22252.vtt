We all invite you to come to Slovenia and explore our lakes,...

00:10.493 --> 00:13.288
...and we would be happy to provide you our escort and service.

00:26.332 --> 00:27.806
I'm from Putnik in London...

00:27.957 --> 00:31.216
...and I'm here on a swimming holiday in Slovenia with my mum.

00:31.855 --> 00:33.305
She's a really keen swimmer.

00:33.410 --> 00:35.356
And so she was really keen on doing this.

00:35.458 --> 00:36.821
And I'm not such a strong swimmer,...

00:36.908 --> 00:39.639
...but you know, I swim a bit and then get in the boat.

00:39.728 --> 00:41.977
And the view everywhere, it's lovely.

00:42.421 --> 00:44.761
Would you tell your friends how beautiful Slovenia is?

00:44.860 --> 00:47.493
It's absolutely beautiful. It's incredible, stunning.

00:54.819 --> 00:55.633
It's fantastic.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.643
Yeah, I swim in salt water at home.

00:59.641 --> 01:04.897
And so I really like the idea of coming to the Slovenian lakes to swim in the fresh water.

01:05.415 --> 01:08.807
The water is so pure and it's the right temperature too.

01:10.727 --> 01:15.616
And the itinerary that we've been on has been really, really good too.

01:15.883 --> 01:19.843
In over three days, we've done three lakes and a river.

01:27.771 --> 01:33.009
It's peaceful, it's quiet, it's calm, it's incredibly clear.

01:33.077 --> 01:34.645
And it's just the best place to swim.

01:35.179 --> 01:38.108
It's amazing to be in between the mountains.

01:38.839 --> 01:42.267
I'm accustomed to the pool which is always the same thing.

01:42.367 --> 01:44.336
This is incredible.

01:45.158 --> 01:45.935
This is really good.

01:46.067 --> 01:47.951
You should all try it.

01:48.363 --> 01:49.090
It's worth it!
