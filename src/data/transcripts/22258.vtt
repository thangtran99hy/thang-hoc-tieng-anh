A killer still roams in the guts of this city and you let him walk away.

00:11.165 --> 00:13.032
Have you done your best to stop him?

00:13.275 --> 00:15.699
To bring this murderer to justice?

00:20.878 --> 00:23.900
You are gifted with wonderful powers,...

00:24.553 --> 00:28.935
...but still you are unable to track down the prey who matters most to you.

00:30.612 --> 00:32.576
Allow me to help you.

00:33.869 --> 00:37.420
I will make you what you are meant to be:...

00:38.138 --> 00:40.019
...the ultimate hunter.

00:59.399 --> 01:04.751
Never forget: what you do defines who you are.

01:05.529 --> 01:11.252
Let's see if a hero or a menace will crawl from the dark.
