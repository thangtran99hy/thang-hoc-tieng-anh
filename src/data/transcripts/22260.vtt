00:03.328 --> 00:04.259
You breathe in air.

00:04.925 --> 00:05.786
It goes down there...

00:06.523 --> 00:09.033
...into your lungs, yeah, you have a pair.

00:09.673 --> 00:12.297
Now to your blood, the oxygen...

00:12.961 --> 00:15.572
...the heart and muscle pumps it to your organs.

00:16.101 --> 00:20.147
They couldn't do without each other 'cause your body acts as one system.

00:22.398 --> 00:23.506
You eat some food.

00:24.161 --> 00:25.099
It's tasting good.

00:25.765 --> 00:28.821
Now down the tube to your stomach and small intestine...

00:28.937 --> 00:31.444
...where it digests and passes through.

00:32.071 --> 00:35.257
It's taken up by your veins and your arteries...

00:35.407 --> 00:39.469
...to all the organs in your body that need some energy.

00:41.753 --> 00:44.283
You stand up tall, you rarely fall...

00:44.846 --> 00:47.355
...because there's bones inside it all.

00:48.091 --> 00:50.657
Your skeleton is made of bones...

00:51.374 --> 00:53.682
...and ligaments connect them all.

00:54.479 --> 00:58.554
You know your body wouldn't stand up if you didn't have a skeleton.

01:00.849 --> 01:03.421
Oh silly me, almost forgot...

01:04.121 --> 01:06.631
...the most important little part.

01:07.253 --> 01:09.933
It's in your head, controls it all.

01:10.518 --> 01:11.496
It's called your brain,...

01:12.085 --> 01:13.089
...if I recall.

01:13.714 --> 01:18.130
Yes, your brain makes it all possible for you to live right now at all.
