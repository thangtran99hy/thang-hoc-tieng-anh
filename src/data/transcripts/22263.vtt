00:00.050 --> 00:02.512
So I feel like the big issue with today's generation is bullying.

00:02.730 --> 00:05.581
Why does bullying continue and why doesn't anybody put a stop to it?

00:05.796 --> 00:07.453
So I thought let's put a crime...

00:07.593 --> 00:11.000
...and let it happen right in front of people's faces and see what they would do.

00:11.168 --> 00:13.395
Because of course, change starts with the people, right?

00:13.801 --> 00:14.225
Yes, it does.

00:14.307 --> 00:14.610
Let's go.

00:15.807 --> 00:16.992
So you're really not gonna help me with my paper?

00:17.067 --> 00:17.281
No.

00:17.355 --> 00:18.407
You're really not gonna help me with my paper?

00:18.476 --> 00:20.277
Let me go. No. I'm sorry.

00:20.409 --> 00:21.211
You remember what happened last time?

00:21.435 --> 00:21.835
Please.

00:21.916 --> 00:22.739
You remember what happened last time?

00:22.841 --> 00:24.131
Stop, stop, no.

00:24.208 --> 00:24.512
Why?

00:25.502 --> 00:26.140
Are you gonna help me?

00:26.209 --> 00:26.899
No, no.

00:27.463 --> 00:28.774
Hey, everybody looking right now.

00:29.383 --> 00:32.479
There's a camera right there and you guys just walked away from a guy getting brutally beat...

00:32.550 --> 00:34.022
...and you guys did nothing to help him.

00:34.479 --> 00:36.946
To stop bullying in America would be really sincere...

00:37.022 --> 00:40.222
...and kind of you guys to try to do something and stop something like that at hand,...

00:40.705 --> 00:44.055
...instead of just walking away and acting like blind victims to something that's going on.

00:44.927 --> 00:46.131
He was about to get really hurt.

00:46.221 --> 00:46.977
I was about to beat him up.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.697
I'm sorry but I don't think this might be a nuisance.

00:49.793 --> 00:51.175
I don't really want to get in any trouble...

00:51.286 --> 00:52.236
...so I'm so sorry about that.

00:53.825 --> 00:54.178
What?

00:54.377 --> 00:55.317
What's going on here?

00:55.598 --> 00:56.651
What is it to you?

00:56.941 --> 00:57.629
What is it for me?

00:57.703 --> 00:58.095
Yeah.

00:58.395 --> 01:01.743
Someone's beating up somebody else, in my university, that's something to do with me.

01:02.023 --> 01:02.961
Is it your problem?

01:03.310 --> 01:03.725
Yes it is.

01:03.809 --> 01:04.414
Can I tell you something?

01:04.546 --> 01:06.496
We just wanted to see what would happen in this kind of predicament.

01:06.591 --> 01:07.505
The camera's right there.

01:07.641 --> 01:09.417
Please don't kill me because you're scaring me right now.
