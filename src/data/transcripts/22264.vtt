This 16-year-old sophomore was born with a brain disorder.

00:02.805 --> 00:05.314
And bullies have always been a part of life.

00:05.730 --> 00:09.037
Until this year, when her mom called on a family friend for help.

00:09.392 --> 00:10.151
It was Carson.

00:10.485 --> 00:12.426
Starting quarterback Carson.

00:12.721 --> 00:16.063
I e-mailed Carson and told him Chy was having some issues.

00:16.386 --> 00:18.029
I just wanted names...

00:18.293 --> 00:22.730
...and he took it a step further and went and gathered Chy at lunch.

00:22.799 --> 00:24.696
And she's been eating with them ever since.

00:24.889 --> 00:26.899
From first hour through the end of the day,...

00:26.985 --> 00:29.569
...Chy's guys make it a point to look after her.

00:29.784 --> 00:32.630
And this group's newfound friendship has changed the game.

00:32.840 --> 00:34.337
They're modest about their small act,...

00:34.413 --> 00:36.925
...but to Chy, high school is a new world,...

00:37.146 --> 00:38.019
...a safe one.

00:38.146 --> 00:40.629
You say, "My team, these are my boys," right?

00:40.756 --> 00:41.279
Yeah.

00:41.413 --> 00:42.103
And why is that?

00:42.252 --> 00:45.559
Because they saved me.

00:46.083 --> 00:48.626
Because I won't get hurt again.

00:48.945 --> 00:52.783
All because a group of boys broke those silly social rules.

00:52.874 --> 00:55.242
And through it, earned a loyal friend.
