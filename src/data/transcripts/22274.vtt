ï»¿Maybe we've been drilling for the wrong thing.

00:04.580 --> 00:08.983
The Iceland Deep Drilling Project bores holes up to three miles deep...

00:09.397 --> 00:13.784
...in an attempt to make geothermal energy a more viable commodity.

00:14.461 --> 00:20.046
But on a 2009 dig, the initiative struck magma just more than a mile down...

00:20.535 --> 00:24.937
...where temperatures can reach as high as 1800 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:25.595 --> 00:29.676
Several deep drilling reports in the journal Geothermics this month...

00:29.925 --> 00:34.175
...suggest the accidental encounter with molten rock could be a breakthrough.

00:34.961 --> 00:40.736
Engineers cemented a steel casing down the well, sending super hot steam up...

00:41.171 --> 00:45.751
...and in the process blowing away the returns of other geothermal projects.

00:46.367 --> 00:50.777
The well delivered moderate energy compared to other resources like coal...

00:51.295 --> 00:53.629
...and had to be closed after a valve failed.

00:54.038 --> 00:58.849
But its biggest achievement was demonstrating the potential for an untapped resource.

00:59.447 --> 01:03.371
Iceland already gets a quarter of its power from geothermal sources...

01:03.700 --> 01:08.650
...and this technology could one day become a huge export in renewable energy.
