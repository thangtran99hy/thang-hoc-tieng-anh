El Nido is a very interesting place at night.

00:09.243 --> 00:13.773
And I'm currently in the Lonesome Carabao Lounge.

00:13.953 --> 00:14.561
I got it right?

00:14.769 --> 00:16.231
And a carabao is like a,...

00:16.403 --> 00:17.515
...how would you describe it, Marco?

00:17.729 --> 00:18.745
You actually run the bar.

00:18.877 --> 00:19.439
I do, yes.

00:19.528 --> 00:22.488
A carabao is a water buffalo, Southeast Asian water buffalo.

00:22.571 --> 00:24.157
It's the national animal of the Philippines.

00:24.368 --> 00:26.259
I come here every two or three months.

00:26.897 --> 00:29.014
I have a local manager to run the bar when I'm not here.

00:30.151 --> 00:31.605
But yeah, we opened two years ago.

00:32.874 --> 00:35.603
El Nido since then has been growing quickly.

00:35.691 --> 00:38.400
But it's still an intimate place where...

00:39.009 --> 00:42.692
...you know, you can have peace on the islands and fantastic nature.

00:42.761 --> 00:44.850
But then at night, you've got, you know, places like this...

00:44.924 --> 00:47.985
...and other places in town that has some good food and some good drinks.

00:49.432 --> 00:50.237
Why El Nido?

00:50.315 --> 00:51.439
Why did you choose El Nido?

00:52.196 --> 00:54.492
Well I first came here three years ago just as a tourist...

00:55.213 --> 00:56.803
...because I was looking for the frontier.

00:56.894 --> 00:58.736
I wanted a place that was unspoiled,...

00:59.206 --> 01:04.238
...beaches where you could be alone and not too commercialized.

01:04.314 --> 01:05.309
And I found that in El Nido.

01:05.879 --> 01:08.120
But I also felt it had potential to grow.

01:08.229 --> 01:09.982
And every time that I've traveled,...

01:10.065 --> 01:12.269
...I've always looked for a place where maybe I could buy some land...

01:12.353 --> 01:13.189
...or settle down or something.

01:13.261 --> 01:15.562
And this really seemed to be a promising spot.

01:15.654 --> 01:19.473
Something that I could see taking off in the next five, ten years or something.
