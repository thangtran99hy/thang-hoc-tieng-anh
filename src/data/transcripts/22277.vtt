00:00.792 --> 00:03.765
Heracleion was once believed to be a myth like Atlantis.

00:04.095 --> 00:04.736
But it's real.

00:05.244 --> 00:09.725
The city disappeared beneath the Mediterranean Sea around 1,200 years ago,...

00:09.804 --> 00:14.135
...and was found during a survey of the Egyptian shore at the beginning of the last decade.

00:14.489 --> 00:19.361
The city was believed to have been a very important place of knowledge, trade, and religion...

00:19.686 --> 00:22.509
...and had even been visited by Helen of Troy.

00:23.494 --> 00:28.905
Scientists have discovered the remains of more than 64 ships, gold coins,...

00:29.071 --> 00:34.710
...giant 16-foot statues and hundreds of smaller statues of minor gods on the sea floor.

00:35.308 --> 00:40.122
The city is submerged under 150 feet of water in the bay of Abu Qir.

00:40.474 --> 00:44.213
It is believed that in the eighth century B.C. when the city was built,...

00:44.581 --> 00:47.063
...it would have sat at the mouth of the river Nile.

00:48.543 --> 00:52.249
Scientists still have little idea what caused the city to sink.

00:52.714 --> 00:54.671
But a number of things could have caused it.

00:55.038 --> 00:57.747
From an earthquake, gradual sea level rise,...

00:57.827 --> 01:01.532
...or sudden collapse of the unstable sediment that the city was built on.

01:02.867 --> 01:07.371
The pictures taken of the statues beneath the water are truly amazing.

01:07.597 --> 01:11.469
And I for one cannot wait to hear about what they find next at Heracleion.
