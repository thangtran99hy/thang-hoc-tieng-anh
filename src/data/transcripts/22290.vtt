ï»¿An electronic cigarette is just like a regular cigarette...

00:04.990 --> 00:08.669
...except instead of using tobacco it uses oil.

00:08.799 --> 00:13.101
This oil is held in a cartridge or in some e-cigarettes known as a tank,...

00:13.225 --> 00:18.531
...and is heated by an atomizer which creates vapor not smoke which you then inhale.

00:18.866 --> 00:25.048
The earliest e-cigarette was patented in 1963 as a smokeless non-tobacco cigarette.

00:25.425 --> 00:26.987
But it wasn't until 40 years later...

00:27.073 --> 00:30.698
...when a Chinese pharmacist perfected the device that it really took off.

00:30.999 --> 00:35.133
E-cigarette sales increase from about 50,000 units sold in 2008...

00:35.433 --> 00:38.459
...to almost 3.5 million sold in 2012.

00:38.871 --> 00:43.445
E-cigarettes have been touted as a viable alternative to help people quit smoking.
