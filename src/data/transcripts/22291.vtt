ï»¿So three weeks of jungle and ocean adventure take out its toll on your feet.

00:07.491 --> 00:10.025
So in this eco fact, we're paying a visit to Dr. Fish.

00:11.915 --> 00:16.100
Well, Dr. Fish isn't actually a real doctor, but definitely a fish,...

00:16.592 --> 00:17.810
...well, in fact, two species,...

00:18.211 --> 00:20.923
...both native to the Middle East that have made their way into society...

00:21.169 --> 00:23.853
...because of their somewhat strange feeding preferences.

00:24.248 --> 00:24.635
Hold on.

00:28.043 --> 00:28.695
That's tickly.

00:31.900 --> 00:39.114
These fish are members of the family Cyprinidae, which includes the minnows and the carps.

00:42.120 --> 00:46.923
So this is a freshwater fish, and they've been called Dr. Fish...

00:47.057 --> 00:50.622
...because they're extremely efficient in removing dead skin cells...

00:50.727 --> 00:54.601
...and treating certain skin diseases such as psoriasis.

00:57.063 --> 01:00.495
I don't think my feet have ever been this popular.
