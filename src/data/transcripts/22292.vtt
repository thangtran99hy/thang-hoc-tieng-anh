One of my least popular ideas was for a completely germfree hot dog stand.

00:04.622 --> 00:08.896
At outdoor food carts, it's easy for germs to transfer from money to your food.

00:09.105 --> 00:10.687
So to completely eliminate this,...

00:10.770 --> 00:14.338
...I designed a hands-free method to apply condiments to the wiener.

00:14.564 --> 00:18.294
Also, there would be a second employee whose only job is to handle the money.

00:18.519 --> 00:19.319
What are you doing with the wallet?

00:19.639 --> 00:22.797
We're doing a germfree experience so you don't handle your own money.

00:22.946 --> 00:23.500
Oh, really?

00:23.635 --> 00:26.231
But people were a bit annoyed with the money handling part.

00:26.457 --> 00:27.027
Can I have my wallet back?

00:27.134 --> 00:30.477
And the hands-free onion dispenser proved to be problematic as well.

00:30.548 --> 00:31.876
So you have to up, one up, one down.

00:31.957 --> 00:33.387
When it hits the table, the onions will fall.

00:33.702 --> 00:34.896
Now drop it, keep dropping it.

00:35.007 --> 00:36.585
Up and down, drop it fast.

00:40.647 --> 00:41.901
This is not gonna work.

00:42.266 --> 00:44.071
That's nothing to do with the contraption.

00:44.133 --> 00:45.815
If you drop a hot dog, you drop a hot dog.

00:45.996 --> 00:49.443
The public just wasn't ready for the germfree hot dog experience,...

00:49.639 --> 00:51.451
...so I laid the concept to rest.
