Wanna save some time and microwave two bowls at once but there's no room?

00:03.987 --> 00:07.203
Place one bowl on top of a coffee mug and the other on the bottom.

00:07.570 --> 00:08.203
You're welcome.

00:08.447 --> 00:10.651
Is your SD card stuck in lock mode?

00:11.065 --> 00:15.283
Grab a small piece of tape and wrap it around the lock area and it's business as usual.

00:15.577 --> 00:19.926
And speaking of removable media, if you ever lose your flash drive or SD card,...

00:20.151 --> 00:24.033
...always name the drive your phone number so whoever finds it can give you a call.

00:24.428 --> 00:27.791
It's hot outside and the flies are sneaking into your house to stay cool.

00:28.047 --> 00:29.909
Don't waste your time swatting them down.

00:30.137 --> 00:33.273
Grab some glass cleaner and pump a light mist into the air.

00:33.502 --> 00:36.097
The ammonia will knock them out and you can clean up the mess.

00:36.387 --> 00:39.169
Be sure to give them the proper Viking funeral they deserve.

00:42.974 --> 00:45.398
How about a simple way to make a stand for your tablet?

00:45.866 --> 00:48.319
Grab two clothes hangers and a paper towel roll.

00:48.944 --> 00:53.343
Glue the paper towel roll to both ends of the hangers and voila, a simple stand.

00:53.741 --> 00:57.012
And while we're on stands, if you wanna do the same thing with your smartphone,...

00:57.388 --> 00:59.159
...all you need is a pair of sunglasses.

00:59.513 --> 01:02.243
Fold them out a bit and place your phone right into the middle.

01:02.523 --> 01:04.407
Now you can play Candy Crush in style.

01:04.561 --> 01:07.063
Wanna make a nifty hidden storage compartment for your home?

01:07.513 --> 01:10.592
Find an old VHS tape case and remove the insert.

01:10.858 --> 01:13.709
Replace it with a normal photo and attach it to the wall.

01:14.126 --> 01:16.323
You now have a photo frame hiding spot.
