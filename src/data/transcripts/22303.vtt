I get asked a lot, "How do you patent an idea?"

00:12.702 --> 00:18.049
And I read a terrific book called "Patent It Yourself."

00:18.742 --> 00:23.959
Fantastic book, very straightforward and I wrote GoPro's first patent.

00:25.463 --> 00:32.700
And the 60-page tome that I went maniacal on, and then, when I took it to attorneys...

00:32.959 --> 00:37.650
...to get their opinion on it, they told me that I saved a ton of money...

00:37.749 --> 00:40.955
...because I have done all this work myself and they could polish it up...

00:42.046 --> 00:42.877
...and finish it off.

00:43.012 --> 00:47.707
And so, I save myself a bunch of money but more importantly it gave me an understanding of...

00:48.380 --> 00:49.807
...what is patentable and what not.

00:50.911 --> 00:56.028
And I think any entrepreneur that is inventing something, that book is phenomenal.

00:57.397 --> 00:59.349
That's, I think, the only book that I read...

01:00.099 --> 01:01.305
...was "Patent It Yourself."
