How does GoPro not become just kind of a fad?

00:04.524 --> 00:10.303
I think we have an unfair advantage as far as consumer product company goes anyway...

00:10.718 --> 00:15.049
...in that we're really building these products for ourselves.

00:15.617 --> 00:18.183
GoPro has somewhat been a selfish company from the beginning.

00:18.260 --> 00:21.481
It started with me wanting to capture photos of myself and my friends surfing.

00:22.185 --> 00:25.076
And now that we're where we are now,...

00:25.243 --> 00:28.168
...we're still just engineering products for ourselves.

00:28.234 --> 00:31.907
Only, we're able to do so much more now than we ever were before.
