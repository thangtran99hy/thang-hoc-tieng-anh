Locals in Mexico City do not only appreciate the Manuel Gea Gonzalez Hospital for its beauty,...

00:06.623 --> 00:11.013
...they are also indebted to its designers for its ability to help purify the air...

00:11.354 --> 00:13.582
...in one of the most polluted towns on earth.

00:14.147 --> 00:19.106
Designed by Berlin-based Elegant Embellishments, the 2,500 square meter facade...

00:19.372 --> 00:21.829
...is constructed from Prosolve modules.

00:22.207 --> 00:27.219
These are coated with a special pigment which, when hit by ambient ultraviolet light,...

00:27.526 --> 00:32.354
...reacts with urban air pollutants, breaking them down into less noxious compounds...

00:32.587 --> 00:34.500
...like carbon dioxide and water.

00:35.663 --> 00:39.993
The pigment itself remains unchanged, which means the modules can keep purifying the air...

00:40.125 --> 00:44.137
...for up to a decade or until their coating wears off.

00:45.287 --> 00:50.939
With a technology like ours, the great thing is you put a Prosolve facade somewhere...

00:51.070 --> 00:55.153
...and it may not lower the macro levels of air pollution...

00:55.400 --> 00:57.510
...for a place like Mexico City right away,...

00:57.932 --> 01:04.828
...but what it can do is lower the levels in having a direct and local effect on the ground.

01:04.969 --> 01:08.939
Elegant Embellishments have already used Prosolve in small structures...

01:09.048 --> 01:12.015
...placed inside a shopping center in Perth, Australia,...

01:12.257 --> 01:15.391
...and are currently working on a hotel project in Abu Dhabi.
