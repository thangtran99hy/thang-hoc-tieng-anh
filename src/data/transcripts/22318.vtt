With so many feel-good chemicals in every bite, it could seem like our hankerings are purely physiological.

00:05.965 --> 00:07.515
But scientists say, probably not.

00:07.947 --> 00:11.884
In a study from the 1990s, volunteers were given either chocolate...

00:12.355 --> 00:15.175
...or a pill with almost all the same active compounds.

00:15.425 --> 00:17.473
The pill alone did not satisfy.

00:17.747 --> 00:19.977
White chocolate, however, did satisfy.

00:20.411 --> 00:24.213
It's made from the fat of chocolate and has the same calorie load in sweetness...

00:24.493 --> 00:28.408
...but it lacks most of the pharmacological ingredients that are in milk or dark chocolate.

00:28.656 --> 00:32.554
Though we can't say that white and milk chocolate satisfy because of the sugar alone.

00:32.907 --> 00:35.987
Because in general, other sweets don't satiate those cravings.

00:36.119 --> 00:39.323
Then there's anandamide, which was not studied in the pill experiment.

00:39.737 --> 00:42.631
But it's fat-soluble, so it could have been in both the white chocolate...

00:42.964 --> 00:45.722
...and the milk chocolate, explaining some of our cravings.

00:45.989 --> 00:48.999
But there's not enough in chocolate to achieve a noticeable high.

00:49.452 --> 00:52.543
Current calculation suggests that a 70-kilogram person...

00:52.745 --> 00:54.511
...would have to eat about a third of his weight,...

00:54.715 --> 00:57.697
...25 kilograms, in order to feel much of anything.

00:57.961 --> 01:01.460
And what about the fact that women reach for chocolate more often than men,...

01:01.785 --> 01:03.607
...especially around monthly menstruation?

01:04.123 --> 01:05.475
That could be culturally mediated.

01:05.713 --> 01:08.889
Scientists say our cocoa desires are more about dealing with stress...

01:09.203 --> 01:12.843
...in a culturally accepted and delicious way than about anything else.
