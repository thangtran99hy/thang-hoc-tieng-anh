ï»¿It's on the brief.

00:08.315 --> 00:09.426
Check paragraph five.

00:10.831 --> 00:11.712
Late night grind, huh?

00:12.489 --> 00:13.215
Just trying to be like you.

00:13.635 --> 00:14.218
What are you studying?

00:14.618 --> 00:15.363
Statistics.

00:16.315 --> 00:16.811
I flunked that.

00:17.509 --> 00:17.906
Have a good night.

00:18.837 --> 00:19.533
Hey, you forgot something.

00:20.137 --> 00:20.470
No, man.

00:21.100 --> 00:21.222
That's for you.

00:21.817 --> 00:22.925
Big Mac extra sauce, right?

00:23.770 --> 00:23.665
Right.

00:24.487 --> 00:25.917
Sometimes being deeply-rooted...

00:26.588 --> 00:26.839
Thanks!

00:27.753 --> 00:28.571
...means simply connected.
