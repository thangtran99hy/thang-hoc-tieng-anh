Extend the first finger of your dominant hand.

00:10.270 --> 00:14.935
And now you've got five seconds to trace a capital Q on your forehead.

00:18.865 --> 00:22.516
Some people draw the Q in a way that can be read by someone facing them,...

00:22.865 --> 00:25.505
...with the tail on the left side of their forehead.

00:26.275 --> 00:29.894
If you did that, then you tend to be aware of how other people see you...

00:30.314 --> 00:33.655
...you're happy being the center of attention and you're a good liar.

00:34.541 --> 00:37.833
Other people draw the Q so they themselves can read it...

00:38.105 --> 00:40.513
...with the tail on the right-hand side of their forehead.

00:40.829 --> 00:44.594
If you did that then you tend to be more of an introvert and not very good at lying.

00:45.233 --> 00:48.124
So if you want to gain a quick and fun insight into somebody,...

00:48.447 --> 00:50.848
...just ask them to draw a Q on their forehead.
