What do you think about the role of hype?

00:04.227 --> 00:09.868
I mean, we've gone through several companies now, Tumbler, Twitter, Foursquare, Zynga;...

00:10.277 --> 00:15.247
...all very hyped at different times, then all have struggled with that hype at times.

00:16.076 --> 00:19.086
What do you do now when you see one of your companies getting hyped?

00:20.775 --> 00:21.911
Well, it's a drug.

00:22.536 --> 00:24.383
As the entrepreneur, you can't resist it.

00:25.725 --> 00:28.017
But it will bite you in the ass every time.

00:29.997 --> 00:32.653
So if you choose to build your company on hype,...

00:33.160 --> 00:34.961
...then you're gonna have to live with the consequences.
