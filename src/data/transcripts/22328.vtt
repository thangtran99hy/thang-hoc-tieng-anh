00:07.218 --> 00:09.103
Let's start with a quick exercise.

00:09.558 --> 00:12.353
I'd like you to force your face into a smile.

00:12.750 --> 00:15.131
Don't just sit there, actually give it a go.

00:15.366 --> 00:17.364
Force your face into a smile.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.412
Now hold that expression.

00:19.791 --> 00:22.529
Everyone knows that when they feel happy they smile,...

00:22.884 --> 00:25.451
...but research shows the opposite is also true.

00:25.956 --> 00:29.455
When you force your face into a smile you start to feel happier.

00:29.549 --> 00:30.750
Keep smiling.

00:31.395 --> 00:34.041
The same is true of how you talk and even walk.

00:34.310 --> 00:37.332
If you put energy into your voice and a spring in your step...

00:37.601 --> 00:39.103
...you'll suddenly feel much better.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.876
Okay, you can stop smiling now.

00:42.337 --> 00:43.311
How do you feel?

00:43.531 --> 00:44.676
Did it work for you?

00:44.996 --> 00:45.856
I hope so.

00:46.149 --> 00:48.569
And next time you want a quick dose of delight,...

00:48.754 --> 00:52.549
...just spend thirty seconds or so behaving like a happy person.
