Now, I'd like to share with you some information about Mardi Gras traditions.

00:05.761 --> 00:07.323
We'll start off with the hurricane,...

00:07.393 --> 00:10.652
...which is probably the most famous cocktail of the French Quarter.

00:11.023 --> 00:14.241
It's a fruit punch-based drink with light rum...

00:14.428 --> 00:17.393
...and we usually garnish it with oranges and cherries.

00:17.777 --> 00:20.543
So during Mardi Gras in the French Quarter you'll see quite a bit of this.

00:21.045 --> 00:23.999
The king cake is also another big tradition.

00:24.385 --> 00:27.860
It symbolizes Kings Day which is usually January 6...

00:27.967 --> 00:30.299
...and signals the beginning of the Mardi Gras season.

00:30.793 --> 00:34.582
The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras are purple, green and gold.

00:35.077 --> 00:40.033
Purple represents justice, green represents space and gold represents power,...

00:40.419 --> 00:45.249
...and are traditionally representative of the three wise men that found the baby Jesus.

00:45.899 --> 00:50.912
And inside the cake, there is usually a little plastic infant.

00:51.107 --> 00:55.012
And whoever gets the cake with the infant inside...

00:55.335 --> 00:57.676
...usually has to throw the next king cake party.

00:58.257 --> 00:59.990
Parades are really big for Mardi Gras.

01:00.146 --> 01:03.684
Usually people are parading around in satin costumes,...

01:04.109 --> 01:05.253
...and are throwing throws,...

01:05.395 --> 01:09.525
...usually beads and doubloons in the different Mardi Gras colors.

01:10.020 --> 01:16.800
And then the second line dance is probably one of the most well-known traditions.

01:16.898 --> 01:20.034
People will parade around the floats with umbrellas.

01:20.150 --> 01:23.335
And that signifies into the parade.

01:23.843 --> 01:25.859
Laissez les bons temps rouler.

01:25.965 --> 01:27.168
Let the good times roll.

01:27.393 --> 01:31.062
Grab your hurricane, your Mardi Gras beads, your king cakes and your good friends,...

01:31.167 --> 01:32.462
...and have a happy Mardi Gras.
