00:01.019 --> 00:04.951
Reunited after being separated for over six decades,...

00:05.543 --> 00:09.646
...South Koreans have crossed the border with the North to meet with family members.

00:10.263 --> 00:13.486
The Korean War in the early 1950s divided the country...

00:13.561 --> 00:15.941
...between a communist North and capitalist South.

00:17.599 --> 00:19.922
Many families became permanently separated,...

00:20.073 --> 00:22.559
...unable to contact each other even by phone.

00:24.102 --> 00:26.634
The reunion waiting list has thousands of names.

00:27.110 --> 00:29.933
These are the lucky few, selected through a lottery.

00:30.563 --> 00:32.001
But the reunions are short.

00:32.685 --> 00:37.300
After just a few days, the elderly, sad Koreans say tearful goodbyes.

00:39.033 --> 00:41.220
For many, the long-awaited reunions...

00:41.299 --> 00:45.495
...will be the last time they'll ever see their separated loved ones.
