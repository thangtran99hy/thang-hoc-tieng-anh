I think when people see a Carnival, they don't realize how much work goes behind it.

00:05.383 --> 00:10.124
People are working all year long on every Carnival season...

00:10.527 --> 00:15.765
...and one of the hardest working people of Carnival are the costume makers.

00:15.888 --> 00:17.259
This is really the tip of the iceberg.

00:17.365 --> 00:23.614
We have 25,000 costumes, uniforms and dresses in our collection.

00:23.687 --> 00:25.806
So this is just a very, very small piece...

00:26.987 --> 00:31.536
...of the Louisiana State Museum Carnival and textile and costume collection.

00:32.158 --> 00:35.047
What we try to show is that Carnival is really an art form,...

00:35.818 --> 00:40.286
...and it's almost like grand opera in that it combines music and costumes...

00:40.359 --> 00:44.292
...and set design and all kinds of different kind of theatrics.

00:44.997 --> 00:47.142
And that's what visitors to the museum will see.

00:47.447 --> 00:51.672
They'll see another side of Carnival, they'll see it going all the way back to the 1700s.

00:52.087 --> 00:55.636
They'll see all of the artistry that goes into the Carnival celebration.

00:55.947 --> 00:59.033
There's nothing like this museum, I don't think, on the planet,...

00:59.836 --> 01:01.224
...just like there's nothing like Carnival.
