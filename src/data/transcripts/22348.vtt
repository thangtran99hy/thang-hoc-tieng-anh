Give yourself a reality check when you go to the dealer to buy a new car.

00:07.422 --> 00:12.429
If you have nine kids and a Saint Bernard, and it's gonna be your daily driver,...

00:12.773 --> 00:15.800
...don't go look at the cute little Mini, sorry.

00:16.379 --> 00:18.019
This is how you need to think:...

00:19.591 --> 00:21.163
...who's in your car most of the time?

00:21.335 --> 00:22.085
Do you have kids?

00:22.170 --> 00:23.683
So you made bad life choices.

00:24.001 --> 00:26.547
Do they need car seats, do they need a booster seat?

00:26.651 --> 00:27.674
Or are they teenagers?

00:27.943 --> 00:30.069
Or maybe you have older parents...

00:30.418 --> 00:33.955
...or people with special needs or handicaps to think about.

00:34.955 --> 00:37.748
Second consideration is fuel economy.

00:38.042 --> 00:39.473
Do you really care...

00:39.875 --> 00:42.278
...if you drive a lot of miles? You probably do.

00:42.494 --> 00:45.193
Last consideration, how do you use your car?

00:45.444 --> 00:49.441
Are you in a car pool rotation or can you live with just two doors?

00:49.879 --> 00:51.556
Do you need cargo space?

00:51.907 --> 00:56.139
Are you in stop-and-go traffic or do you live in the Great White North?

00:56.355 --> 00:57.857
Do you need four-wheel drive...

00:58.218 --> 01:02.824
...or will front drive work just as well as that gas-sucking four-wheeler?
