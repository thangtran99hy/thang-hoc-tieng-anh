00:00.205 --> 00:05.981
Point A to point B, for some that's all a car was ever meant to connect.

00:06.794 --> 00:10.840
But as we know a lot can happen between point A and point B.

00:12.168 --> 00:15.989
So the way a car connects had to change, it had to evolve.

00:17.496 --> 00:20.435
Which is why we created the new Audi connect.

00:21.531 --> 00:26.287
A revolutionary innovation that seamlessly keeps drivers in touch with the world around them.

00:27.067 --> 00:30.439
Audi connect is about giving drivers the quickest route possible...

00:31.167 --> 00:34.823
...and uncovering the last available parking spot once they get there.

00:37.639 --> 00:42.469
It's about making sure drivers are in touch with their destination long before they arrive.

00:43.065 --> 00:45.958
All while listening to their personalized radio station.

00:48.323 --> 00:52.063
Audi connect has even changed what it means to be sent a simple photograph.

00:52.452 --> 00:55.109
As a picture can now transmit a location.

00:56.271 --> 01:00.267
Combine this with the only cars powered with 4G LTE.

01:00.627 --> 01:02.670
And Audi drivers aren't just connected.

01:03.343 --> 01:06.449
They're connected faster than anyone else on the road.

01:08.901 --> 01:09.684
Audi connect.

01:10.130 --> 01:11.310
It's how we connect.

01:14.807 --> 01:17.807
Now available in the all-new Audi A3.
