00:00.040 --> 00:04.450
Tight loops, soft ringlets or ribbony spirals,...

00:04.973 --> 00:07.772
...curly hair has a dynamic all its own.

00:08.627 --> 00:12.671
And now, science has quantified its unique characteristics...

00:12.875 --> 00:17.094
...with applications that far outstrip a curly coif.

00:17.781 --> 00:22.551
Researchers at MIT and the University Pierre and Marie Curie...

00:22.890 --> 00:27.847
...have created the world's first model of the 3-D shape of curly hair,...

00:28.131 --> 00:33.241
...utilizing lab experimentation, existing theory and computer simulation...

00:33.452 --> 00:36.455
...to identify the main parameters for curls.

00:37.054 --> 00:40.894
These were then simplified into two dimensionless parameters:...

00:41.161 --> 00:43.122
...one for curvature, the other for weight.

00:43.829 --> 00:46.203
When factored in with length and thickness,...

00:46.517 --> 00:51.649
...these can predict the shape of any curled strands suspended under its own weight.

00:52.326 --> 00:54.232
How does a curl, curl?

00:54.956 --> 01:01.061
From the bottom it seems, where the hooklike curve becomes unstable under its own weight...

01:01.223 --> 01:04.651
...and falls out of a two-dimensional plane into a helix.

01:05.199 --> 01:09.261
And because these dimensionless parameters are infinitely scalable,...

01:09.704 --> 01:14.515
...they can be used to predict the curliness of anything even remotely flexible,...

01:15.068 --> 01:18.959
...from a spool of wire to miles of oil pipeline.
