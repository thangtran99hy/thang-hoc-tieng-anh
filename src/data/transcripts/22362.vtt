ï»¿Could it be the most star-studded selfie ever taken?

00:12.654 --> 00:18.301
As the most photographed people in the world photograph themselves at the Oscars.

00:18.508 --> 00:21.431
So right now, I'm gonna take a picture of us.

00:21.548 --> 00:21.700
Okay.

00:21.971 --> 00:24.344
And then, we'll see if we can break the record for the most retweets.

00:24.453 --> 00:24.693
Okay.

00:24.869 --> 00:25.309
And then...

00:25.658 --> 00:25.959
Get her in.

00:26.028 --> 00:27.363
...yeah, you should get in here too, Julia.

00:28.049 --> 00:29.473
Channing, if you can get in also.

00:30.330 --> 00:31.622

00:32.266 --> 00:33.237

00:33.861 --> 00:34.811
Brad, get in here.

00:35.140 --> 00:35.585
Hey, that's good.

00:35.661 --> 00:36.157
Look at us.

00:37.741 --> 00:38.239
Nice!

00:38.539 --> 00:38.931
Not bad.

00:39.981 --> 00:41.018
Oh, yes!

00:41.973 --> 00:42.729
We did it!

00:42.849 --> 00:43.347
Thank you!

00:43.859 --> 00:45.531
Oh, I've never tweeted before!

00:46.436 --> 00:46.972
Retweet it!

00:47.417 --> 00:49.000
This is the most retweets in the history!
