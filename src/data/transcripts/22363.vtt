00:02.975 --> 00:03.454
Come on, kid.

00:03.693 --> 00:05.677
The best thing about being a veterinary technician,...

00:05.750 --> 00:08.799
...the thing that I love the most, is to be able to help animals.

00:08.927 --> 00:14.071
To see them come in very sick, and then a few days later, they're going home.

00:14.465 --> 00:17.293
And they're happy and the tails are wagging or they're meowing.

00:18.037 --> 00:18.921
It's a wonderful feeling.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.143
It really helps mend your heart.

00:22.424 --> 00:27.347
On a daily basis, a veterinary technician does whatever is asked of him or her.

00:27.795 --> 00:31.242
We tend to do a lot of restraint, holding animals and such.

00:31.577 --> 00:33.449
We do do IV catheters.

00:34.361 --> 00:38.923
We take blood from the animals and we often run the blood tests on the animals.

00:39.647 --> 00:44.838
We do help to prep for surgeries, clipping and scrubbing and such.

00:45.189 --> 00:48.497
We clean up after the animal, whatever needs to be cleaned up.

00:48.988 --> 00:51.847
If we have time, we like to play with the animals...

00:52.300 --> 00:56.762
...just to help have them be more comfortable in the hospital.
