Welcome to English in a Minute.

00:07.162 --> 00:12.145
If you listen to American English, you probably have heard this phrase:...

00:12.725 --> 00:13.654
...play it by ear.

00:14.557 --> 00:15.242
What does it mean?

00:15.954 --> 00:19.729
Let's find out by listening to an American English conversation.

00:20.691 --> 00:21.807
Hey, what do you want to do this weekend?

00:22.433 --> 00:22.897
I don't know.

00:22.977 --> 00:24.644
We could see a movie or have dinner.

00:24.838 --> 00:25.959
Why don't we play it by ear?

00:26.455 --> 00:26.674
Sure.

00:27.508 --> 00:31.687
"Play it by ear" means you aren't going to make a firm plan,...

00:32.151 --> 00:35.486
...but will decide what to do as you go along.

00:36.143 --> 00:38.599
This idiom has a musical meaning too.

00:39.173 --> 00:42.089
When you don't have the written music for a song,...

00:42.710 --> 00:48.087
...but you play the notes that you think you've heard, you play it by ear.

00:48.641 --> 00:53.275
So when you are in a situation where you make a plan as you go,...

00:53.655 --> 00:56.137
...you're playing it by ear.

00:57.403 --> 00:58.973
And that's English in a Minute.
