00:00.050 --> 00:02.886
Korean singles commonly begin dating in college.

00:02.995 --> 00:05.903
They go on mee-ting, group blind dates.

00:06.027 --> 00:08.354
Mee-ting, mee-ting.

00:08.545 --> 00:12.797
Mee-ting usually involves a lot of alcohol, drinking games, and laughter.

00:12.897 --> 00:16.419
These group blind dates have an equal number of females and males.

00:16.559 --> 00:19.695
Participants privately discuss who they're most interested in.

00:20.011 --> 00:22.161
And hopefully pair up with their preferred choice.

00:22.331 --> 00:23.877
Even if you don't find romance,...

00:24.207 --> 00:26.888
...mee-ting is a wonderful opportunity to network...

00:27.018 --> 00:29.243
...and to make some unforgettable memories.

00:29.471 --> 00:33.175
On the other hand, so-gae-ting are one-on-one blind dates.

00:33.361 --> 00:36.235
A mutual friend or acquaintance will play matchmaker,...

00:36.309 --> 00:38.945
...and set you up with someone they believe is fitting to you.

00:39.052 --> 00:41.030
They may know the individual personally,...

00:41.273 --> 00:43.698
...or know them through a series of mutual friends.

00:43.831 --> 00:47.623
By the way, it's not "so getting", it's so-gae-ting.

00:48.191 --> 00:51.503
So-gae-ting, so-gae-ting.

00:51.849 --> 00:53.903
Seon is another type of blind date.

00:54.256 --> 00:56.186
But this one's arranged by parents.

00:56.296 --> 00:58.635
Because the potential in-laws are prescreened,...

00:58.950 --> 01:01.325
...parents feel more comfortable with this option.

01:01.489 --> 01:05.027
Family approval in marriage or dating can make or break a couple.

01:05.201 --> 01:10.645
In ideal cases, individuals find their husband or wife after several seon blind dates.

01:10.787 --> 01:14.663
Needless to say, arranged dates are widely accepted in Korea.
