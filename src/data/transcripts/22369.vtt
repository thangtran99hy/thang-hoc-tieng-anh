One of the best things about being a scientist is you get to spend your day solving puzzles.

00:07.819 --> 00:09.371
You have this interesting scientific question...

00:09.745 --> 00:12.071
...and you spend years sometimes trying to get the answer.

00:12.482 --> 00:15.505
And the prize when you solve the puzzle is you get a new puzzle.

00:15.918 --> 00:19.405
Each new discovery branches out into all these new and interesting ideas.

00:23.549 --> 00:26.425
My name is Steve Buratowski, I'm a professor at Harvard Medical School...

00:26.500 --> 00:28.903
...and my lab works on the punctuation of the genome.

00:29.556 --> 00:32.648
If you look at your DNA sequence, it's just this long string of letters.

00:32.946 --> 00:37.567
It's like a book that has no spaces between the words, no punctuation, no title page.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.369
It turns out your genome does have all that...

00:39.739 --> 00:41.514
...and we're trying to figure out how that works.

00:46.150 --> 00:51.036
So, it turns out that a lot of diseases, things like cancer, developmental defects...

00:51.304 --> 00:54.279
...are caused by problems in either writing or reading this punctuation...

00:54.667 --> 00:56.789
...and so by figuring out the basic mechanisms,...

00:57.300 --> 01:00.271
...we're gonna contribute to developing therapeutics for patients.
