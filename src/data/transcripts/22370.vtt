00:00.113 --> 00:04.611
On average, Earth orbits about 93 million miles from the sun.

00:05.162 --> 00:11.967
An international team has now found a planet orbiting 650 times further than that,...

00:12.468 --> 00:16.149
...leading astronomers to wonder how it exists at all?

00:17.180 --> 00:23.669
11 times Jupiter's mass, the planet called "H D 106906 b"...

00:23.973 --> 00:28.095
...orbits at 60 billion miles from its sun-like star.

00:28.749 --> 00:35.155
The mysterious world is quite young, just 13 million years old, making it a puzzle.

00:35.859 --> 00:39.079
Typically, researchers believe planets that orbit stars...

00:39.387 --> 00:43.993
...are created from the gas, dust, and other debris around a young star...

00:44.707 --> 00:47.969
...which would make such a distant, young formation impossible.

00:48.753 --> 00:54.065
In this case, astronomers suspect the pair began forming as binary stars...

00:54.519 --> 00:57.423
...but the planet never quite became a star itself.
