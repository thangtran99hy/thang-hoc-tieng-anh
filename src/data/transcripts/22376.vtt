Every day when I wake up, I still can't believe I'm at Harvard.

00:11.995 --> 00:14.603
Like every freshman, I get to live in Harvard Yard...

00:17.220 --> 00:19.121
...and I get to eat breakfast in Annenberg Hall.

00:22.048 --> 00:25.297
I really enjoy my freshman seminar "The Evolution of Aging."

00:25.909 --> 00:29.275
It's just me, 15 other students and a faculty member.

00:30.661 --> 00:33.797
And I get to work directly with my professor on research projects.

00:34.987 --> 00:39.175
I'm able to visit any of the other great Harvard schools like the School of Engineering...

00:40.023 --> 00:42.907
...or the Kennedy School where I've heard world leaders speak...

00:43.879 --> 00:48.473
...or the medical school, which is pretty cool because I'm also training to become an EMT. 

00:49.225 --> 00:50.249
I wanna become a doctor.

00:51.449 --> 00:54.983
Every day, I get to hang out with my friends and try something new.

00:56.838 --> 00:59.877
Harvard is one university with a million things to explore...

01:00.785 --> 01:03.693
...and I'm glad I've got the next three years to try them all.

01:04.578 --> 01:07.429
My name is Anthony and I'm from Tucker, Georgia.
