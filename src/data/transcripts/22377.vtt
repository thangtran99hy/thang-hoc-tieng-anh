In 1988, I was running my own restaurant and I came down with a severe cough.

00:06.613 --> 00:11.635
And after numerous tests, I got diagnosed with HIV.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.675
Managing the daily tasks required to live well with a chronic disease is challenging.

00:17.084 --> 00:22.246
Sharon Thomas credits much of her success to a cold, wet nose and a warm, fuzzy cuddle.

00:24.877 --> 00:27.437
I can't imagine life without having pets.

00:27.741 --> 00:29.596
I think that that's why God has them here.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.437
Pets can be a wonderful support for adults living with chronic illness.

00:34.751 --> 00:39.671
Allison Webel of the Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing at Case Western Reserve University...

00:40.052 --> 00:42.608
...led a new study of nearly 50 participants...

00:42.991 --> 00:46.268
...to better understand how women manage their HIV AIDS.

00:46.750 --> 00:52.161
We were really surprised by the central role that pets really seem to have...

00:52.293 --> 00:55.145
...in helping them to manage their day-to-day health tasks,...

00:55.341 --> 00:59.159
...such as adhering to medications and following a healthy lifestyle.

00:59.479 --> 01:02.871
It's someone who kind of gives them a way of organizing their day,...

01:03.100 --> 01:08.081
...so the routine work of feeding the pet and walking the pet...

01:08.262 --> 01:09.370
...and coming home to the pet.

01:09.542 --> 01:15.053
And all of those positive responsibilities lead women to best manage their health.

01:15.354 --> 01:16.153
It's almost vital.

01:16.271 --> 01:19.684
Taking care of the two of them takes care of me automatically.
