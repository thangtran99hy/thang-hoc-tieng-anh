Hi, I'm Miranda Kerr...

00:06.130 --> 00:11.663
...and I'm so excited to be the newest face and hair of Clear Scalp and Hair here in the US.

00:12.169 --> 00:13.579
Today, we're here in New York City...

00:13.687 --> 00:16.890
...and we're filming the new television commercial for Clear Scalp and Hair.

00:17.511 --> 00:21.600
The ad is all about building resilience from the foundation,...

00:21.709 --> 00:23.728
...for hair that feels strong and unbreakable.

00:27.708 --> 00:33.159
Resilient hair is the hair that can handle all kinds of daily torture,...

00:33.331 --> 00:37.151
...that I know about between photo shoots, and runway shows and events,...

00:37.271 --> 00:39.449
...I have put my hair through a lot of torture.

00:39.557 --> 00:44.937
And I must say that using Clear products has really helped my hair be more resilient...

00:45.018 --> 00:47.374
...so it can bounce back and come out looking gorgeous.

00:51.779 --> 00:54.191
I really love Clear's total hair collection.

00:54.270 --> 00:56.265
It's like a one-stop shop for your hair.

00:56.471 --> 01:01.859
The range is great for dryness, for flyaways, for frizziness, or for damaged hair.

01:01.961 --> 01:05.551
So it's my go-to shampoo for every day.
