00:02.237 --> 00:04.657
Actors, directors, screenwriters.

00:04.783 --> 00:08.635
Tomorrow morning, they'll all find out if they land a coveted Oscar nomination.

00:09.280 --> 00:13.890
But there's another industry group anxiously awaiting the press conference: Accountants.

00:14.317 --> 00:17.339
And the Oscar goes to "The King's Speech".

00:17.745 --> 00:21.199
An Oscar can have significant financial ramifications for a film.

00:21.535 --> 00:23.497
They say it's an honor just to be nominated.

00:23.805 --> 00:26.596
And when it comes to cashing in at the box office, that's true.

00:26.792 --> 00:30.689
Several studies have demonstrated a bump in post-nomination box office,...

00:30.877 --> 00:33.265
...sometimes increasing ticket sales by up to a third.

00:33.687 --> 00:36.689
Of course, a lot of that growth depends on when the film was released.

00:36.888 --> 00:40.945
A newer movie like "Her" can expect a bigger percentage bump from a nomination...

00:41.013 --> 00:43.840
...than something like "Gravity", which came out months earlier.

00:44.071 --> 00:46.066
Winning gives an even bigger boost.

00:46.208 --> 00:51.910
Research firm IBIS World tracked the Best Picture race from 2007 to 2011.

00:52.179 --> 00:56.697
Best Picture winners made an extra 17.9 million dollars after the show.

00:57.127 --> 01:01.985
Best Picture nominees that didn't win only made an extra 4.2 million afterwards.

01:02.248 --> 01:06.452
Last year, Best Picture winner "Argo" jumped 21 percent at the box office...

01:06.526 --> 01:08.069
...the weekend after its Oscar win.

01:08.507 --> 01:10.763
It was its 21st week in theaters.

01:10.865 --> 01:12.498
It was already out on DVD at that point.

01:12.882 --> 01:15.625
That's another way Oscar nominations boost finances...

01:15.912 --> 01:17.208
...although it's a little harder to track.

01:17.491 --> 01:22.497
Academy Award Winner, Best Picture Nominee, you'll see this on DVD boxes forever,...

01:22.663 --> 01:26.267
...or at least for the next two or three years that DVD boxes exist.

01:26.845 --> 01:28.539
It's a permanent marketing tool,...

01:28.689 --> 01:31.867
...and more actors and actresses can brag about their Oscar status.

01:32.213 --> 01:34.918
They experience less of a reliable financial bump.

01:35.415 --> 01:38.789
Sure, they might get considered for more roles, which might lead to more money,...

01:39.194 --> 01:40.632
...but ultimately, they're gonna be judged...

01:40.839 --> 01:43.161
...on the box office of their most recent outing.

01:43.623 --> 01:44.206
Show me the money.

01:44.714 --> 01:46.842
Not after he showed his "Boat Trip" and "Daddy Day Camp".
