00:00.324 --> 00:03.189
One day, the hare and the tortoise decided to have a race.

00:03.895 --> 00:05.697
The hare was making fun of the tortoise.

00:05.888 --> 00:06.279
He said,...

00:06.719 --> 00:07.668
..."You are so slow."

00:07.941 --> 00:09.747
"It will take you days to reach anywhere."

00:10.505 --> 00:12.383
Is that so, you arrogant hare.

00:12.897 --> 00:15.279
Let's have a race and see who is faster.

00:16.726 --> 00:20.782
The angry tortoise decided to challenge the hare and teach him a lesson.

00:22.215 --> 00:24.833
The hare was amused and looked at the whole thing as a joke.

00:25.638 --> 00:29.288
They decided on the racing path and chose the fox as the umpire.

00:30.132 --> 00:31.799
The rivals started as expected.

00:32.299 --> 00:35.119
The speedy hare soon left the tortoise far behind.

00:36.212 --> 00:39.549
Having reached halfway, the hare decided to take a break.

00:40.713 --> 00:42.356
What a lovely summer day it is.

00:42.649 --> 00:45.666
I will eat some grass and rest before I restart the race.

00:46.524 --> 00:49.319
So he began to nibble on the green grass of the meadows.

00:50.619 --> 00:52.927
Soon after, he decided to take a nap.

00:53.342 --> 00:53.899
He thought,...

00:54.398 --> 00:58.422
..."Even if the tortoise passes me, I will overtake him and reach the finish line."

00:58.870 --> 01:01.182
"There's nothing to worry about with the slow tortoise."

01:02.071 --> 01:03.358
The tortoise prodded on.

01:03.697 --> 01:08.447
Unwavering, unhesitating towards his goal in his resolve to beat the hare.

01:10.240 --> 01:12.174
The hare, in the meantime, had overslept.

01:12.781 --> 01:17.102
When he awoke, he realized that the tortoise had overtaken him by quite a distance.

01:17.798 --> 01:19.935
He cursed and ran as fast as he could.

01:21.298 --> 01:24.412
When he reached the finish line, the tortoise was already there,...

01:24.595 --> 01:26.417
...waiting for the hare's late arrival.

01:27.272 --> 01:28.700
The hare learnt his lesson.

01:29.437 --> 01:31.721
Never make fun of anyone's weakness.

01:32.921 --> 01:35.885
Pride and arrogance will always lead to your downfall.

01:36.667 --> 01:39.470
The hare accepted his defeat graciously...

01:39.819 --> 01:43.521
...and apologized to the tortoise for his rude behavior.
