ï»¿Is your desktop looking a little cluttered?

00:04.042 --> 00:05.873
Here are a few tips to help you gain control.

00:06.497 --> 00:09.628
First things first, if you're just moving files into documents...

00:09.774 --> 00:13.361
...create shortcut folders on your desktop but limit the number of folders.

00:13.553 --> 00:18.288
For example, create an "Actions" folder for items such as forms to fill out or files to upload.

00:18.527 --> 00:23.131
Create a "Current Projects" folder for containing long-term items such as presentations for work.

00:23.359 --> 00:25.411
Once the project is done, move it to "Archives."

00:25.739 --> 00:28.361
Choose a clean or attractive wallpaper you wouldn't want to clutter...

00:28.522 --> 00:31.545
...and consider putting your shortcuts elsewhere, like the menu or launch bar.

00:31.773 --> 00:35.750
But if you're the kind of person who wants everything at your fingertips, check out Fences.

00:36.171 --> 00:40.093
This free program lassoes your icons and puts them into little boxes that you can label.

00:40.301 --> 00:43.932
Or try Dexpot, a program that turns your desktop into four,...

00:44.118 --> 00:46.290
...categorized by different wallpapers of your choice,...

00:46.539 --> 00:48.767
...so you can put your icons on whatever screen you like.

00:49.175 --> 00:51.255
For Macs, try "Otto the Automator,"...

00:51.728 --> 00:54.679
...the Mac's native application for setting up automated tasks.

00:54.881 --> 00:56.354
Check it out in your "Applications" folder.

00:56.611 --> 00:59.644
And if you like the sound of Fences, you can build your own version in Photoshop.

00:59.815 --> 01:03.106
Choose your wallpaper, create a new layer and add boxes or lines.
