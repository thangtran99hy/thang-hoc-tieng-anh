Today, we're going to see what happens when you put Ivory soap in the microwave.

00:10.848 --> 00:16.042
Ask your parents to take a bar of Ivory soap and cut it into little pieces like this one.

00:17.815 --> 00:21.994
Now we're going to put it in the microwave for about 80 seconds to see what happens.

00:32.878 --> 00:34.985
As you can see, the soap has expanded.

00:35.883 --> 00:39.195
Ivory soap is the only soap that will float in water.

00:40.149 --> 00:42.959
This is because of all the air pockets inside of it.

00:43.698 --> 00:47.034
When heated, steam is created in those air pockets,...

00:47.233 --> 00:50.305
...which is pushing out the soap, making the soap expand.

00:51.570 --> 00:55.299
The soap is not hot, it feels really cool when you touch it.

01:00.117 --> 01:02.937
This is a really fun experiment to try at home.
