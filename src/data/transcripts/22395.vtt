Dogs are not usually relaxed in a lab environment...

00:04.363 --> 00:06.378
...but with a little petting and lots of treats,...

00:06.507 --> 00:09.706
...they can be trained to sit still even in an MRI scanner.

00:10.051 --> 00:13.229
That's how researchers at Hungary's ELTE University...

00:13.540 --> 00:15.643
...were able to get images of their brains at work.

00:16.087 --> 00:17.978
Research fellow Attila Andics says...

00:18.091 --> 00:21.187
...it helped them better understand the dogs' relationship with humans.

00:21.425 --> 00:27.318
We have known for a long time that dogs and humans share similar social environment,...

00:27.717 --> 00:34.823
...but now our results show that dogs and humans also have similar brain mechanisms...

00:35.057 --> 00:37.115
...to process social information.

00:37.486 --> 00:41.139
After training 11 dogs to stay motionless while their brains were scanned,...

00:41.619 --> 00:44.003
...the researchers checked their neurological responses...

00:44.154 --> 00:46.691
...to about 200 emotionally relevant sounds,...

00:47.037 --> 00:49.620
...from whining and crying to playful barking and laughing.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.423
They then compared the responses from human subjects.

00:52.735 --> 00:54.222
They found striking similarities.

00:54.503 --> 00:57.326
Andics says it opens new possibilities for research.

00:57.642 --> 01:01.800
The canine mind is also being studied at Duke University in North Carolina.

01:02.363 --> 01:05.869
Co-Director of the school's Canine Cognition Center, Evan MacLean,...

01:06.269 --> 01:09.139
...says that the Hungarian results are an important step forward.

01:09.410 --> 01:13.024
And what that tells ordinary dog owners, the Hungarian scientists say,...

01:13.484 --> 01:16.911
...is to treat your canine companions as friends, not mere animals,...

01:17.241 --> 01:19.763
...because they evidently understand human feelings.

01:20.159 --> 01:23.284
