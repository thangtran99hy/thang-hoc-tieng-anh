00:01.085 --> 00:04.193
The so-called Exosuit is made of aluminum alloy,...

00:04.378 --> 00:09.192
...stands about two meters tall and weighs more than 240 kilograms.

00:09.375 --> 00:13.251
It is designed to protect divers below 300 meters,...

00:13.480 --> 00:17.196
...where the pressure is 30 times greater than on the surface.

00:17.700 --> 00:22.368
The Exosuit, unveiled at the American Museum of Natural History in New York,...

00:22.556 --> 00:28.456
...has 18 rotary joints, providing better freedom of movement than similar suits.

00:28.960 --> 00:34.649
Still, says Michael Lombardi, the museum's diving safety officer who tested the suit,...

00:34.920 --> 00:37.203
...it takes some time to get used to.

00:37.379 --> 00:42.162
The Exosuit has four 1.6 horsepower water-jet thrusters,...

00:42.419 --> 00:45.213
...controlled by pressure-sensitive pads in the boots.

00:45.571 --> 00:50.073
The oxygen supply allows the diver to stay underwater for hours,...

00:50.269 --> 00:52.637
...with up to 50 hours of life support.

00:53.075 --> 00:56.339
A special tether will provide contact with the surface...

00:56.535 --> 01:00.297
...and send high-quality video of underwater organisms.

01:00.753 --> 01:03.957
Scientists are especially excited about the possibility...

01:04.029 --> 01:09.679
...of studying bioluminescent and biofluorescent animals in their own habitat.

01:09.923 --> 01:14.339
It took 14 years for the Canadian firm Nuytco Research Ltd...

01:14.592 --> 01:17.430
...to design and construct a single Exosuit,...

01:17.728 --> 01:20.636
...at the cost of more than one million US dollars.

01:20.891 --> 01:23.195
It is scheduled to be tested in July,...

01:23.398 --> 01:27.792
...about 160 kilometers off the coast of New England.
