Take a look at these two blue circles.

00:09.535 --> 00:13.742
The blue circle on the right looks slightly larger than the blue circle on the left.

00:13.956 --> 00:15.727
Actually, this is an illusion.

00:16.010 --> 00:20.006
When something is surrounded by large objects, it looks relatively small.

00:20.532 --> 00:22.156
Take away the surrounding objects...

00:22.302 --> 00:26.073
...and you can see that the blue circles are actually the same size.

00:26.709 --> 00:29.352
The same type of illusion affects your waistline.

00:29.878 --> 00:32.576
When you place a portion of food onto a small plate,...

00:32.718 --> 00:37.190
...it looks relatively large, and so you often end up putting less on the plate.

00:37.747 --> 00:40.502
In fact, psychologist Brian Wansink has discovered...

00:40.580 --> 00:43.725
...that just moving from a 12-inch to a ten-inch plate....

00:44.035 --> 00:46.972
...causes people to eat around 20% less.

00:47.447 --> 00:51.860
So if you want to lose weight the easy way, simply switch to smaller plates.
