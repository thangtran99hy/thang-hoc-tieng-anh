Malaysian authorities say about 40 ships and 22 planes...

00:06.793 --> 00:11.409
...are aiding an intensive search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

00:11.863 --> 00:16.667
The search has broadened to include land and sea off Malaysia's west coast...

00:16.877 --> 00:20.131
...because there are signs the plane may have turned around.

00:20.339 --> 00:24.301
Aviation safety experts say turning back at cruising altitude...

00:24.651 --> 00:27.089
...is a sign that something may have gone wrong.

00:27.497 --> 00:31.052
And the plane may have been trying to make an emergency landing.

00:31.502 --> 00:35.649
Most plane crashes occur during takeoff or landing says Daniel Tsang,...

00:36.107 --> 00:39.449
...an airline safety expert who spoke with VOA via Skype.

00:39.614 --> 00:44.141
Although a large oil slick was spotted after a second day of searching,...

00:44.249 --> 00:47.482
...there were still no signs of wreckage of the plane.

00:47.896 --> 00:51.585
Wreckage debris could help shed light on what might have happened.

00:51.928 --> 00:56.361
The revelation that at least two of the passengers were using stolen passports...

00:56.517 --> 01:01.943
...and questions about the identity of two others has raised concerns about terrorism.

01:02.347 --> 01:06.971
Malaysia's Transportation and Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein says...

01:07.086 --> 01:09.983
...authorities are checking the names of those on board.

01:10.200 --> 01:14.981
Analysts say the fact that two passengers got on board using stolen documents...

01:15.417 --> 01:17.418
...will raise some difficult questions.

01:18.059 --> 01:22.547
Malaysian authorities are reviewing security camera footage of the two individuals...

01:22.939 --> 01:25.517
...who got on board with falsified documents.
