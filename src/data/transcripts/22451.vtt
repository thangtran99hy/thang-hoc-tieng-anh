Well, I've got my teams but I also can appreciate greatness.

00:02.735 --> 00:04.487
I've always been a big Bulls fan.

00:04.684 --> 00:07.749
I actually didn't mind when they would beat the Celtics.

00:11.233 --> 00:13.717
You know, Michael Jordan was just, not only the greatest player of all time,...

00:13.830 --> 00:15.132
...but one of the most charismatic guys.

00:15.353 --> 00:16.166
I loved Rodman.

00:16.729 --> 00:18.227
I loved Pax, what a great guy he is, too.

00:18.417 --> 00:21.604
It just had so many great teams and I certainly can't deny greatness;...

00:21.689 --> 00:23.051
...I'm one of those guys that appreciates it.

00:23.221 --> 00:25.679
And it's great to see that kind of talent at that level.

00:26.232 --> 00:29.039
Like, "I'm so happy that Derrick Rose is back, let's see what you guys can do."

00:29.146 --> 00:31.718
And made the run that he made last year without Derrick Rose.

00:31.949 --> 00:32.933
It was pretty remarkable.

00:33.266 --> 00:34.613
You know, when I think of him coming back,...

00:34.744 --> 00:37.075
...I think he's arguably the best player in the league,...

00:37.159 --> 00:38.473
...I think I'd put him out there with LeBron.

00:38.851 --> 00:41.321
Hopefully somebody to beat the Heat, but no, I'm excited.

00:42.310 --> 00:43.085
I just love the game.
