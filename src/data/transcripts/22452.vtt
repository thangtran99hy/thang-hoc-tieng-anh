ï»¿I'm Alexa von Tobel  the founder and CEO of LearnVest.com,...

00:05.619 --> 00:07.029
...the leading site for women and their money.

00:07.553 --> 00:10.165
When you're getting married, how are you really supposed to join your finances?

00:10.281 --> 00:12.680
Some people opt to completely join their accounts entirely.

00:12.945 --> 00:14.837
Others opt to keep them completely separate.

00:15.173 --> 00:17.014
My favorite option though is a hybrid model.

00:17.336 --> 00:18.106
Here's how I think about it.

00:18.561 --> 00:22.485
Let's say you take home 4,000 dollars a month and he takes home 3,000 dollars a month.

00:22.914 --> 00:27.287
What you would do is each puts 75 percent of what you take home into an "our" account.

00:27.875 --> 00:32.571
That would give you about 5,250 dollars each month for rent, utilities,...

00:32.871 --> 00:34.241
...a vacation that you're striving for,...

00:34.529 --> 00:37.261
...but that really lets you live your lives together and spend together.

00:37.693 --> 00:40.797
Each of you would then take 25 percent of what you take home and that would mean...

00:40.885 --> 00:43.716
...you would have about 1,000 dollars in your own separate "fun" fund...

00:44.083 --> 00:45.781
...and he would have about 750.

00:46.359 --> 00:47.765
With that, you can do whatever you want.

00:47.933 --> 00:49.504
That's the money for you to go out with your friends,...

00:49.614 --> 00:53.027
...to go for drinks at bars, to buy him a present, to pay for your pet,...

00:53.451 --> 00:54.833
...whatever it is that you wanna do...

00:54.933 --> 00:57.574
...and frankly, why you work so hard to make your own money.

00:57.919 --> 01:01.095
This is a great way to join your finances that keeps you free from fights...

01:01.258 --> 01:04.481
...has a solid foundation and ultimately lets you live your richest life.
