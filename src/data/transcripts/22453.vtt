00:00.127 --> 00:01.784
Which game matters most?

00:01.975 --> 00:03.916
One played under a million lights...

00:04.079 --> 00:06.021
...or another beneath the suburban sun?

00:06.523 --> 00:10.797
Does it matter whether ten, or ten to the power of ten people watch?

00:12.243 --> 00:13.698
Not in the heat of battle.

00:15.075 --> 00:19.121
Not when you've given everything to give even more.

00:19.557 --> 00:21.811
Every kick has a consequence.

00:22.453 --> 00:25.817
The game that matters most is the one you're playing.
