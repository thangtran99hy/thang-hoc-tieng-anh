The stadiums are a very essential part of the FIFA World Cup...

00:03.716 --> 00:08.411
...and definitely are not only the heart and soul of an event like the World Cup...

00:08.493 --> 00:11.617
...but also an important part of a legacy of this event...

00:12.015 --> 00:14.924
...in terms of the infrastructure left in the host country.

00:15.043 --> 00:16.887
That's why it's an essential part...

00:17.015 --> 00:19.696
...and a very important element of our sustainability strategy.

00:19.819 --> 00:23.638
With this, our responsibility and the responsibility of the local organizing committee...

00:24.071 --> 00:27.273
...to take measures, in order to, as much as possible...

00:27.399 --> 00:29.680
...increase the positive impact that the World Cup has...

00:29.769 --> 00:34.157
...and reduce the negative impact that it has on both society and the environment.

00:34.260 --> 00:36.998
Most of the stadiums underwent that certification...

00:37.201 --> 00:39.825
...and that is the basis upon which we build on...

00:40.085 --> 00:44.074
...with the training for the stadium operators in terms of sustainability.

00:44.220 --> 00:49.134
Beyond the World Cup, it's not for the World Cup, but also to provide lessons to them,...

00:49.243 --> 00:55.091
...and let it to be a legacy to our country to manage this in a good way.
