00:01.492 --> 00:03.675
I know one thing for sure about genius.

00:04.207 --> 00:04.977
I know I'm not that.

00:05.777 --> 00:09.121
I know I'm blessed, and I know I may have that gene...

00:09.197 --> 00:10.736
...that just sort of seizes the moment.

00:11.557 --> 00:14.953
But other than that, I know nothing about genius.

00:15.243 --> 00:18.299
I do have intuitive moments, but they're all based off of...

00:19.751 --> 00:22.311
...noticing the rhythms of repetition and experiences...

00:22.382 --> 00:23.581
...of things that I've seen before.

00:23.819 --> 00:26.624
I don't know if there's anything genius about just sort of pointing things out.

00:26.770 --> 00:29.219
Honestly, it's just a teaspoon of audacity...

00:29.302 --> 00:31.931
...to at least work up the nerve to just ask for it.

00:32.913 --> 00:36.123
But the ambition to like sort of really dream super elaborately...

00:36.263 --> 00:40.249
...so that if the opportunity ever comes around, I go for it.
