As your career progresses, you may be looking to gain a pay rise...

00:03.395 --> 00:05.894
...but there are a few things you need to do in order to secure it.

00:06.407 --> 00:09.471
Taking on extra work is a prudent way to get noticed in the workplace.

00:09.830 --> 00:13.838
Taking on more responsibility and projects will show that you're dedicated to the company...

00:14.135 --> 00:15.882
...and interested in career progression.

00:16.377 --> 00:18.431
Keep a log of any extra work you take on...

00:18.679 --> 00:21.976
...and assure you raise this in meetings to support your case for a pay rise.

00:22.657 --> 00:25.993
Networking, whether it's an industry events or internal company events...

00:26.395 --> 00:28.682
...is definitely worth doing if you're looking for a pay rise.

00:29.129 --> 00:32.495
Heading out to networking events is a great way to meet industry contacts...

00:32.859 --> 00:34.902
...and to find out about new opportunities.

00:35.454 --> 00:39.551
Attending internal networking events is also a great way to build rapport with colleagues...

00:39.851 --> 00:41.158
...and senior members of staff.

00:41.929 --> 00:45.398
The only way you can secure a pay rise is by letting your boss know about your progress...

00:45.533 --> 00:48.801
...and work, and by telling them that you are looking for a salary increase.

00:49.237 --> 00:50.999
Gather together your career portfolio...

00:51.283 --> 00:54.651
...and ensure you arrange regular meeting to keep your boss updated.
