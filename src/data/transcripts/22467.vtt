ï»¿Hey, I'm Luke.

00:03.767 --> 00:05.255
I'm traveling around with my friends...

00:05.613 --> 00:08.395
...and we've got a lot of good tips for you on your travel in Africa.

00:08.703 --> 00:10.909
In Africa, everything is relaxed...

00:11.501 --> 00:12.903
...so adapt and enjoy.

00:13.127 --> 00:15.379
Don't forget to bring a hat and sunglasses.

00:15.579 --> 00:17.117
So remember to bring a headlight;...

00:17.532 --> 00:20.422
...you will see how to put on makeup...

00:20.708 --> 00:23.993
...or find a toilet or eat or anything else.

00:24.729 --> 00:27.551
The nights in the deserts can be very cold...

00:27.755 --> 00:30.415
...therefore don't forget warm clothes.

00:30.719 --> 00:32.504
So make sure you bring enough money...

00:32.747 --> 00:34.481
...because they have good local beers, man.

00:35.293 --> 00:39.630
Don't forget to take a plug for the African plug sockets...

00:40.013 --> 00:41.925
...otherwise you can't recharge your material...

00:42.227 --> 00:45.099
...like your video camera or your photo camera or your mobile phone.

00:45.321 --> 00:48.075
If you go to Africa, don't forget about your camera.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.104
There are loads of stuff to take pictures of.

00:50.345 --> 00:52.459
You know, take the big thing with you.

00:52.816 --> 00:55.666
Remember to bring your binoculars so you can see the animals better.

00:56.140 --> 00:56.953
I am a guide.

00:57.725 --> 01:01.185
When you come to the bush, you need a guide like me.

01:02.837 --> 01:05.592
I can show you some animals.

01:06.573 --> 01:09.249
I can show you the directions of the delta.

01:09.644 --> 01:14.330
Don't forget to check if there is malaria in the area you are traveling to.

01:14.866 --> 01:17.324
You cannot get lost when you are with me...

01:17.478 --> 01:18.789
...'cause I'm the guide in the delta.
