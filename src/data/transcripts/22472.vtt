ï»¿Forests are part of our life.

00:07.019 --> 00:08.827
They protect us as we grow.

00:16.531 --> 00:19.018
They clean the air we breathe.

00:21.683 --> 00:25.382
They give us food, water, and health.

00:26.824 --> 00:31.409
They provide shelter, employment, and income.

00:35.769 --> 00:36.668
Look around.

00:39.012 --> 00:40.749
Can you imagine your life without them?

00:42.681 --> 00:46.484
On the 21st of March, think about our forests.

00:48.917 --> 00:50.021
Sustain them.

00:54.386 --> 00:55.937
They are our future.
