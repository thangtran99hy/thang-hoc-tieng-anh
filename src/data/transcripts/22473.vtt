When I first came here, I didn't go out when it was raining.

00:12.131 --> 00:14.636
I thought that if it's raining, I should stay at home...

00:15.185 --> 00:17.185
...because that's what I usually do in Kyrgyzstan...

00:17.282 --> 00:19.790
...because Kyrgyzstan is a very sunny country.

00:20.305 --> 00:24.225
But then I realized that if I stay at home when it's raining,...

00:24.382 --> 00:26.937
...I will not be able to socialize with people at all.

00:27.022 --> 00:29.015
So I started to go out when it's raining.

00:29.333 --> 00:33.421
What I really liked was English breakfast when I first tried it...

00:33.499 --> 00:36.867
...because in my country, in the morning, we don't really eat much.

00:36.953 --> 00:40.406
It's just like, I don't know, sandwiches, like salad and stuff like that.

00:41.267 --> 00:42.953
But when I first tried English breakfast,...

00:43.023 --> 00:45.091
...the whole day, I didn't want to eat anything else.

00:45.206 --> 00:48.297
I was so full and full of energy as well.

00:48.819 --> 00:54.275
To be honest, London is such a multicultural city that I get kind of lost and...

00:55.239 --> 00:58.195
...I don't really see British food that much because I eat so much different food.
