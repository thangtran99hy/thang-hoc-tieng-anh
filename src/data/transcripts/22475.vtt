ï»¿What should we all carry in our wallet?

00:02.127 --> 00:05.804
When I went through Lauren's wallet, I noticed that she was carrying about 45 dollars in cash.

00:06.102 --> 00:07.425
This is exactly appropriate.

00:07.799 --> 00:09.217
Don't carry a lot of cash in your wallet.

00:09.485 --> 00:12.503
The average person who loses their wallet will lose a few times throughout their lifetime.

00:12.847 --> 00:14.626
Next up, we are going through your credit cards.

00:14.782 --> 00:19.135
You won't need to carry no more than two in your wallet and ideally from two different vendors.

00:19.304 --> 00:22.890
A lot of people, and I've been guilty of this myself, carry receipts around in their wallet.

00:23.232 --> 00:25.171
They have a lot of identifying information on them.

00:25.337 --> 00:29.184
They have the last four digits of your credit card and worse they have your signature.

00:29.509 --> 00:31.388
That means that they could actually use your credit card...

00:31.509 --> 00:34.355
...and sign your name almost exactly as you signed it.

00:34.599 --> 00:38.525
And lastly, something that was so interesting that you did that I was so proud of is...

00:38.788 --> 00:40.686
...Lauren has a picture of her when she's little.

00:40.931 --> 00:43.019
Is she not the most precious child?

00:43.473 --> 00:47.044
It's just an interesting fact to know that if you have a baby photo or even a puppy photo,...

00:48.075 --> 00:50.628
...you have a much higher likelihood of someone returning your wallet.

00:51.084 --> 00:53.191
So that's all the tips that we have for you today.

00:53.507 --> 00:56.885
I hope you look through your own wallet and make sure that you're not a big offender.
