My dad knew me as being a crybaby and being really fragile.

00:05.654 --> 00:07.391
He thought I would get beat up and quit,...

00:08.093 --> 00:09.837
...but I proved him wrong.

00:14.270 --> 00:17.793
A lot of people on my mom's side of the family was like, what is she doing?

00:18.588 --> 00:20.199
Nobody really understood it but me.

00:23.916 --> 00:25.539
Yes, there has been times in boxing when I was like,...

00:25.674 --> 00:27.585
..."Oh, I hate this, I don't wanna do this anymore",...

00:28.262 --> 00:30.512
...but I always find my way back to the gym...

00:30.914 --> 00:32.077
...and everything works out.

00:34.433 --> 00:36.903
Whoever wants it more, then that's where you'd wanna put in the most work.

00:37.401 --> 00:39.261
And the faster are those that don't always win the race,...

00:39.481 --> 00:40.195
...and that's true.
