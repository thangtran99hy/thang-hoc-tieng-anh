My dad was in the restaurant industry for 30 years, and he worked really hard...

00:05.835 --> 00:09.551
...and he didn't want any of his children to work in the restaurant industry.

00:13.446 --> 00:17.245
I thought that the only thing I'd ever be is be honest and truthful,...

00:17.531 --> 00:20.501
...and cooking wound up being something I love to do.

00:23.044 --> 00:27.809
It was the first time in my life where I was like, I wanna wake up early.

00:27.915 --> 00:30.127
I wanna get to work and I wanna be a sponge,...

00:30.260 --> 00:32.209
...and I wanna help out as much as possible.

00:32.783 --> 00:36.194
And it sort of dawned on me that, you know,...

00:36.329 --> 00:38.275
...like very few people ever get to experience that.
