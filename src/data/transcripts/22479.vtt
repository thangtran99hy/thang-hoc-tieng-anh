Coughing, sneezing, aches and pains: all normal symptoms of the dreaded flu.

00:05.745 --> 00:08.942
But did you know you can actually have no symptoms at all?

00:09.579 --> 00:13.548
A new study out of England found that about three-quarters of infected people...

00:13.668 --> 00:18.189
...showed no signs of the seasonal flu or swine flu in recent years,...

00:18.541 --> 00:21.809
...potentially making the spread of the virus all the more likely.

00:22.196 --> 00:25.447
To get the results, researchers looked at data during the winter flu seasons...

00:25.555 --> 00:30.867
...between 2006 and 2011, including the 2009 outbreak of swine flu.

00:31.111 --> 00:32.698
The results, published in The Lancet,...

00:32.794 --> 00:37.038
...showed about 18 percent of people without a vaccine got the virus,...

00:37.161 --> 00:41.105
...but only 23 percent of those people actually developed symptoms.

00:41.333 --> 00:45.459
Fewer than one in five people were sick enough to see a doctor or stay home from work.

00:45.575 --> 00:47.226
That's not really getting the flu though, is it?

00:47.417 --> 00:49.827
Well, it's not like any flu I've ever had...

00:50.056 --> 00:52.560
...or at least one I knew I had.
