Jonathan, my dog needs to go to yoga and then go to his therapist so make that happen.

00:03.401 --> 00:04.365
Don't sit down.

00:04.697 --> 00:06.139
Where did you get those amazing pants?

00:06.221 --> 00:07.233
Oh, I got them at Old Navy.

00:07.394 --> 00:08.277
Can you spin, please?

00:08.648 --> 00:08.869
Sure.

00:10.043 --> 00:10.489
Double time.

00:10.610 --> 00:10.918
Again?

00:11.753 --> 00:12.039
Sure.

00:13.591 --> 00:15.496
Are all these questions gonna be about my pants?

00:15.581 --> 00:16.789
This is a law firm so yes.

00:16.943 --> 00:17.761
Tell me about your shirt.

00:18.157 --> 00:19.481
It came for free with the pants.

00:19.579 --> 00:20.919
You know, I don't like when people lie to me.

00:21.118 --> 00:21.481
It's true.

00:21.578 --> 00:22.242
How much are the pants?

00:22.324 --> 00:23.125
25 dollars.

00:23.269 --> 00:23.486
What?

00:23.646 --> 00:24.271
But not for long.

00:24.348 --> 00:26.175
Congratulations, whatever your name is, you got the job.

00:26.773 --> 00:28.111
Make sure to lock up on your way out.

00:28.485 --> 00:28.819
Move!

00:29.352 --> 00:29.725
Sorry!
