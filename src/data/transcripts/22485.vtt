00:03.213 --> 00:05.723
What I am about to tell you sounds crazy,...

00:07.719 --> 00:09.229
...but you have to listen to me.

00:12.225 --> 00:14.935
Your very lives depend on it.

00:27.105 --> 00:29.037
You see, this isn't the first time...

00:36.352 --> 00:37.788
...that we've had this conversation.

00:38.887 --> 00:39.637
What day is it?

00:40.173 --> 00:41.082
Judgment Day.

00:41.455 --> 00:43.467
You just came in with the fresh recruits.

00:50.187 --> 00:53.499
The invasion will fail along with every soldier you are sending.

00:54.212 --> 00:56.853
We lose everything.

01:01.240 --> 01:03.333
Come find me when you wake up!

01:15.531 --> 01:16.931
You do know what's happening to me.

01:17.659 --> 01:19.301
What happened to you happened to me.

01:22.444 --> 01:23.865
You hijacked their power.

01:26.714 --> 01:27.454
I need your help.

01:27.852 --> 01:28.985
With what, exactly?

01:29.151 --> 01:29.840
Winning the war.

01:31.299 --> 01:32.234
We can do this.

01:32.438 --> 01:34.587
Just come here every day and I'll train you.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.479
No matter what I do, this is as far as you go.

01:46.598 --> 01:48.313
Why does it matter what happens to me?

02:07.567 --> 02:09.314
I'm not a soldier.

02:12.957 --> 02:14.851
Of course you're not; you're a weapon.
