00:00.136 --> 00:03.059
As a scientist, one is a citizen of the world.

00:03.421 --> 00:05.931
And as a citizen of the world, you have certain responsibilities.

00:06.287 --> 00:09.025
There's an old Quaker saying: "You do what you can where you are."

00:09.583 --> 00:13.117
And I think that's a mantra for scientists, too.

00:14.339 --> 00:16.447
A tireless activist since college,...

00:16.644 --> 00:21.287
...Mary-Claire King has blended her career as a geneticist with her deep sense of humanity,...

00:21.564 --> 00:25.211
...becoming a role model for generations of young women scientists everywhere.

00:26.523 --> 00:30.057
Her first breakthrough came in 1975 at UC Berkeley,...

00:30.381 --> 00:35.565
...where she proved the genetic link between humans and chimpanzees was 99% identical:...

00:35.757 --> 00:38.097
...a revolutionary and controversial discovery.

00:38.845 --> 00:42.835
In the 80s, King's passion for human rights took her down a different path.

00:43.244 --> 00:47.347
After the six-year Dirty War left hundreds of Argentinian children orphaned,...

00:47.567 --> 00:50.812
...it was King's development of mitochondrial DNA sequencing...

00:50.975 --> 00:54.386
...that allowed grandmothers to legally reclaim their lost grandchildren.

00:54.555 --> 00:58.715
Our development of mitochondrial DNA sequencing as a tool for identification...

00:58.997 --> 01:00.475
...was at the demand of the abuelas.

01:00.755 --> 01:05.129
They said, "There must be a way of following lineages through women."

01:05.336 --> 01:07.367
And I said, "Well, yes."

01:07.853 --> 01:10.533
And they said, "All right, nina, go back to Berkeley and figure it out."

01:11.429 --> 01:13.029
"Vamonos when you've figured it out."

01:14.613 --> 01:15.230
So I did.

01:15.993 --> 01:19.755
While this discovery has had monumental effects on families worldwide,...

01:20.140 --> 01:22.991
...Mary-Claire King's crowning achievement was yet to come.

01:23.412 --> 01:26.547
In 1990, after a 15-year-long hunt,...

01:26.816 --> 01:30.691
...she traced breast cancer to a single gene, BRCA1:...

01:30.917 --> 01:34.963
...a monumental first step in the continuing battle against the disease.

01:35.515 --> 01:39.504
The women who have developed this condition want it to be solved.

01:39.950 --> 01:43.787
So I feel absolutely in solidarity, to use an old 60s term,...

01:44.181 --> 01:46.680
...with the women who are the participants in our work.

01:47.184 --> 01:50.775
It's much easier, much more fun, much more productive...

01:51.086 --> 01:53.209
...to work with a community that wants you to work with them.
