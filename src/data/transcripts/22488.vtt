00:00.072 --> 00:03.949
Scientists are saying they found gravitational waves from the big bang,...

00:04.119 --> 00:10.725
...giving us a look into what our universe was like only 380,000 years into its existence.

00:10.837 --> 00:14.038
They're calling the discovery as big as it gets.

00:14.335 --> 00:17.135
Hey everybody, I'm Patrick Jones and welcome to Buzz 60.

00:17.297 --> 00:20.397
The discovery and analyzing of these gravitational waves...

00:20.469 --> 00:24.332
...are proof the big bang was really the kickoff of it all.

00:24.517 --> 00:28.419
Gravitational waves are very tiny ripples in space-time,...

00:28.569 --> 00:33.611
...originally predicted by Mr. Albert Einstein in 1916.

00:33.748 --> 00:36.706
They've never been detected before now.

00:36.847 --> 00:39.721
Researchers from Harvard University made the discovery...

00:39.805 --> 00:42.769
...using the BICEP2 telescopes in Antarctica.

00:42.949 --> 00:46.204
The waves supposedly line up with the sudden brief...

00:46.509 --> 00:51.796
...and very violent period of our universe's expansion called "inflation".

00:51.976 --> 00:54.682
More than one scientist is saying the work is Nobel-worthy.

00:54.887 --> 01:00.071
We'll see, but it's definitely a "we'll open the good bottle of wine" discovery.
