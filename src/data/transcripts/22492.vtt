ï»¿It all started with a picture and a Facebook page.

00:04.719 --> 00:07.903
I put Karrie's picture on Facebook, the first day of school,...

00:08.533 --> 00:12.572
...and I came home from work that day and had a ton of e-mails from parents of kids,...

00:13.100 --> 00:16.337
...daughters with Down syndrome who said, "Where do you get her clothes?"

00:16.867 --> 00:17.950
That's where Wet Seal comes in.

00:18.166 --> 00:19.703
See, this is Karrie's favorite store,...

00:20.393 --> 00:24.091
...so Sue set up a Facebook page with Karrie wearing a different outfit from here every day.

00:24.663 --> 00:25.950
Because she wants to be a model for Wet Seal,...

00:26.365 --> 00:27.515
...maybe this will work.

00:27.900 --> 00:29.497
Maybe we can catch their attention this way.

00:29.900 --> 00:31.209
You might say she caught their attention.

00:31.881 --> 00:34.925
They said if she can get 10,000 likes by 5:00 on Friday,...

00:35.630 --> 00:36.828
...that they would have a surprise for her.

00:37.460 --> 00:41.006
She had over 11,000 by noon on Thursday.

00:41.421 --> 00:41.817
The surprise?

00:43.359 --> 00:46.201
Wet Seal flew Karrie and her mom to California for a photo shoot.

00:46.843 --> 00:49.303
She kinda comes to life when the camera's on her.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.501
To watch Karrie, you'd never believe that when she was born,...

00:52.897 --> 00:57.964
...I was told by this geneticist when she was a week old to never expect anything from her.

00:58.387 --> 00:59.230
Sue never bought into that.

00:59.700 --> 01:03.894
There's a level of expectation that we all do our best where it concerns her.

01:04.326 --> 01:05.775
And that's what got Karrie where she's going.

01:06.804 --> 01:08.119
Well, that and a lot of personality.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.287
Bunny ears on Mom?

01:10.408 --> 01:12.371
