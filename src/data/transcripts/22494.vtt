This is a tip that was actually shared with us by a realtor friend of mine.

00:04.167 --> 00:08.851
And he told me, "Just remember the word FORD when you're in a conversation with anyone..."

00:09.364 --> 00:11.229
"...and it will help you spark up conversations."

00:11.673 --> 00:15.182
The way this works is basically just remember the acronym FORD.

00:15.846 --> 00:19.370
F stands for family, so ask people first about their family.

00:19.468 --> 00:20.865
People love to talk about their family.

00:22.035 --> 00:23.486
The O is for occupation.

00:24.258 --> 00:26.328
You can ask them about their job or how their job is going.

00:27.241 --> 00:31.714
R is for recreation, so you can ask them about their hobbies.

00:32.201 --> 00:34.005
People love to talk about that stuff, of course.

00:34.459 --> 00:35.586
And then D is dreams.

00:36.113 --> 00:41.952
So if you always remember that acronym: Family, Occupation, Recreation and Dreams,...

00:42.353 --> 00:43.343
...just remember the word FORD.
