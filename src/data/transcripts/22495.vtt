ï»¿Well, if you have facts and figures that you have to present,...

00:03.257 --> 00:06.954
...look at what is really, really important within those facts and figures.

00:07.403 --> 00:11.029
Figure out: "Well, why should people listen to what I have to say here?"

00:11.450 --> 00:13.557
And only choose the things that are really important.

00:13.941 --> 00:15.027
The rest of the information,...

00:15.149 --> 00:18.157
...the audience can simply just look at it and pretty much understand it.

00:18.521 --> 00:22.983
But what they don't know is the why or how behind those facts and figures.

00:23.379 --> 00:26.669
So what you have to do then is choose the most important thing...

00:26.752 --> 00:29.488
...or the main point from that particular slide...

00:30.009 --> 00:34.458
...and talk about the why and how from that particular item,...

00:34.941 --> 00:37.495
...and give a little background story and information about that.

00:37.995 --> 00:42.619
That will make that information much more interesting and relevant to your audience.

00:43.178 --> 00:46.383
That's how you can make facts or figures that may be boring...

00:46.654 --> 00:49.634
...into something a lot more interesting for your audience.
