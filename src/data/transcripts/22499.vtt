Imagine that you are in charge of a company and are hiring for a new position.

00:10.712 --> 00:11.817
Here are the candidates.

00:12.427 --> 00:15.400
Without thinking about it too much, which one would you choose?

00:16.167 --> 00:18.632
My guess is that you went for one of those in the middle...

00:18.834 --> 00:20.689
...and avoided the people on the ends.

00:21.378 --> 00:21.901
Why?

00:22.107 --> 00:24.878
Because research shows that we tend to unconsciously think...

00:25.109 --> 00:27.573
...those towards the middle of a group are more important.

00:28.008 --> 00:31.242
Some of the work has examined the TV quiz show "The Weakest Link",...

00:31.674 --> 00:35.104
...in which contestants stand in a semicircle and vote one another off.

00:35.733 --> 00:38.103
Those standing towards the middle of the semicircle...

00:38.190 --> 00:41.352
...won the game on average 45 percent of the time,...

00:41.927 --> 00:45.169
...whilst those standing on one of the ends won just ten percent of the time.

00:45.719 --> 00:47.953
So if you want to make a good impression during a meeting,...

00:48.183 --> 00:50.464
...make certain you sit towards the middle of the group.
