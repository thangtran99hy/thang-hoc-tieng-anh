Hi, I'm Richard Bartrem, Vice President Communications for WestJet.

00:03.980 --> 00:07.409
Today, we're announcing the easing of restrictions on pets in the cabin.

00:07.815 --> 00:11.851
We recognize that a growing number of our guests wanna travel with their extended family...

00:12.094 --> 00:14.947
...and we're proud to be the first airline to offer this type of service.

00:15.615 --> 00:19.157
WestJet's new service, "Furry Family", now allows for any type of animal...

00:19.252 --> 00:20.519
...that fits safely on board.

00:21.863 --> 00:24.951
What's more, we will no longer require animals to be kept in the kennels...

00:25.026 --> 00:25.857
...while they're travelling with us.

00:26.325 --> 00:27.953
After all, they're part of the family.

00:32.323 --> 00:34.775
WestJet's in-flight crews have received special training...

00:35.037 --> 00:38.245
...on how to care for the diverse family members we'll now be welcoming on board.

00:47.268 --> 00:51.557
And don't worry, our lavatory is a bit modified to meet the needs of our special guests.

00:53.529 --> 00:56.247
So if you are looking to travel with your pet, whatever it is,...

00:56.658 --> 01:00.537
...learn more about our new program at westjet.com/furryfamily.

01:01.787 --> 01:04.804
Happy April Fools' from your friends at WestJet!

01:07.403 --> 01:08.282
