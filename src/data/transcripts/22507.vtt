00:01.861 --> 00:03.733
Say you're helping plan a friend's party,...

00:03.917 --> 00:07.793
...and he sends you a text asking you to bring Bob, a DJ and a clown.

00:08.137 --> 00:09.142
You're pretty impressed.

00:09.314 --> 00:11.539
You had no idea Bob was so multitalented.

00:11.927 --> 00:14.845
But when the day arrives, it turns out that he's not,...

00:15.077 --> 00:17.872
...and you were supposed to bring three different people.

00:18.715 --> 00:21.285
As you and Bob sit at the silent, clownless party,...

00:21.597 --> 00:24.281
...it occurs to you that the confusion could've been avoided...

00:24.474 --> 00:27.269
...simply by using another comma after DJ.

00:28.208 --> 00:30.052
This final comma in a list,...

00:30.217 --> 00:35.053
...placed directly before the main conjunction, such as "and", "or" or "nor",...

00:35.257 --> 00:38.079
...is called the serial comma or Oxford comma.

00:38.649 --> 00:41.119
And it has long driven grammar nerds crazy...

00:41.271 --> 00:45.573
...because even major language institutions can't agree on whether it should be used.

00:45.977 --> 00:49.041
Ironically, the Oxford comma is more common in the United States,...

00:49.252 --> 00:52.303
...where it's recommended by the MLA, the Chicago Style Manual...

00:52.463 --> 00:56.424
...and the US Government Printing Office, though not by the AP Stylebook.

00:56.851 --> 00:59.021
In the UK and other English-speaking countries,...

00:59.111 --> 01:01.508
...most style guides do not support the comma's use,...

01:01.786 --> 01:05.149
...with the exception of its namesake: the Oxford University Press.

01:05.805 --> 01:07.405
Why not use the serial comma?

01:08.111 --> 01:09.209
One of the main arguments...

01:09.293 --> 01:12.429
...is that the conjunction is usually enough to denote a separate entity.

01:12.726 --> 01:15.463
And where it's not, like in your ill-fated invite list,...

01:15.756 --> 01:18.395
...changing the order of terms will usually do the job.

01:18.861 --> 01:20.797
Journalists also dislike the comma...

01:20.887 --> 01:24.230
...because it takes up precious space and can make text look cluttered.

01:24.553 --> 01:26.779
Sometimes it can even create confusion of its own.

01:27.322 --> 01:31.140
For example, if your friend had asked for Bob, a DJ and a puppy,...

01:31.479 --> 01:34.043
...you'd probably figure out that they're three separate beings.

01:34.330 --> 01:36.527
Puppies are cute but they don't make great DJs.

01:37.355 --> 01:39.953
With the comma, you may think Bob is the DJ...

01:40.055 --> 01:41.883
...and all you need is him and a puppy.
