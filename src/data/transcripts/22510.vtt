Flies and mosquitoes can be a nuisance around the home.

00:04.727 --> 00:07.309
So here's a quick tip on how to create an effective trap...

00:07.425 --> 00:09.823
...using household ingredients and a plastic water bottle.

00:10.151 --> 00:12.434
First, you wanna cut off the top of your water bottle.

00:12.701 --> 00:15.552
Then you invert the top and tape the two pieces together.

00:18.775 --> 00:22.281
Next, you wanna add simple syrup made from equal parts sugar and water,...

00:22.921 --> 00:25.206
...leaving about an inch between the spout and the fluid.

00:25.641 --> 00:28.237
Insects will travel inside and get caught in the liquid.

00:28.609 --> 00:32.861
For an even stronger attractant, use a solution of warm water, sugar, and yeast...

00:32.959 --> 00:36.293
...which creates more carbon dioxide and works really well with mosquitoes.

00:36.509 --> 00:38.632
If you have an effective liquid bait that you use,...

00:38.755 --> 00:40.667
...we'd love to hear about it in the comments below.
