Snakes are cold-blooded reptiles that depend on the heat from their surroundings...

00:06.249 --> 00:08.531
...to control the temperature of their bodies.

00:10.429 --> 00:14.617
This is why most snakes are found in tropical regions of the world.

00:16.743 --> 00:20.335
There are no snakes in Iceland, Greenland and Antarctica.

00:22.167 --> 00:26.270
The venom of the king cobra, the world's largest poisonous snake,...

00:26.597 --> 00:28.879
...is strong enough to kill an elephant.

00:31.059 --> 00:33.938
Snakes have highly stretchable jaws...

00:34.261 --> 00:38.620
...and can swallow a prey three times larger than their mouth.

00:40.975 --> 00:46.387
Snakes shed their skins every once in a while so they are usually very, very clean.
