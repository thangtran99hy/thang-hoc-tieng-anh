ï»¿Incredible.

00:01.735 --> 00:02.645
Ellen, I love you.

00:03.410 --> 00:10.001
To my fellow nominees, I'm so proud to share this journey with you.

00:10.107 --> 00:13.390
I'm in awe and I have so much respect for you all.

00:14.323 --> 00:16.347
To the Academy, thank you.

00:18.366 --> 00:23.581
In 1971, Bossier City, Louisiana, there was a teenage girl...

00:24.413 --> 00:27.818
...who was pregnant with her second child.

00:28.854 --> 00:35.879
She was a high school dropout and a single mom.

00:36.761 --> 00:41.835
But somehow, she managed to make a better life for herself and her children.

00:41.880 --> 00:49.176
She encouraged her kids to be creative, to work hard and to do something special.

00:49.681 --> 00:53.407
That girl is my mother and she's here tonight.

00:57.200 --> 01:00.216
And I just want to say I love you, mom.

01:00.299 --> 01:01.848
Thank you for teaching me to dream.

01:04.814 --> 01:07.607
To my brother Shannon, the best big brother in the world,...

01:07.670 --> 01:08.524
...you're a true artist.

01:08.567 --> 01:13.206
Thank you so much for sharing this insane and amazing adventure that is 30 Seconds to Mars...

01:13.406 --> 01:15.165
...and for being my best friend.

01:15.443 --> 01:15.826
I love you.

01:15.963 --> 01:16.200
Thank you.

01:19.822 --> 01:23.343
To all the dreamers out there around the world watching this tonight...

01:23.774 --> 01:26.697
...in places like the Ukraine and Venezuela.

01:28.633 --> 01:32.630
I wanna say we are here...

01:33.573 --> 01:41.100
...and as you struggle to make your dreams happen, to live the impossible,...

01:41.369 --> 01:42.843
...we're thinking of you tonight.
