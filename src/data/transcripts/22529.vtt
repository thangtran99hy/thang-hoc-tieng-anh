00:00.985 --> 00:05.687
There's a few things, about three things to my account that I need each day.

00:06.979 --> 00:10.687
One of them is something to look up to, another is something to look forward to,...

00:10.903 --> 00:13.384
...and another is someone to chase.

00:14.723 --> 00:19.537
Now, first off, I wanna thank God 'cause that's who I look up to.

00:20.534 --> 00:22.879
He has graced my life with opportunities...

00:23.682 --> 00:25.947
...that I know are not of my hand or any other human hand.

00:27.090 --> 00:33.406
He has shown me that it's a scientific fact that gratitude reciprocates.

00:34.619 --> 00:38.665
In the words of the late Charlie Laughton who said,...

00:39.025 --> 00:42.376
..."When you got God, you got a friend and that friend is you."

00:44.967 --> 00:49.159
To my family, that's who and what I look forward to.

00:49.835 --> 00:53.655
To my father who I know is up there right now with a big pot of gumbo.

00:53.913 --> 00:55.512
He's got a lemon meringue pie over there.

00:55.572 --> 00:58.031
He's probably in his underwear and he's got a cold can of Miller Lite...

00:58.137 --> 00:59.491
...and he's dancing right now.

01:01.285 --> 01:04.055
To you, Dad, you taught me what it means to be a man.

01:05.068 --> 01:06.115
To my mother who's here tonight,...

01:07.785 --> 01:12.225
...who taught me and my two older brothers, demanded that we respect ourselves.

01:13.074 --> 01:16.039
And what we in turn learned was then we were better able to respect others.

01:16.898 --> 01:17.657
Thank you for that, mama.

01:18.054 --> 01:21.905
To my wife Camila and my kids Levi, Vida and Mr. Stone,...

01:22.324 --> 01:26.073
...the courage and significance you give me every day I go out the door is unparalleled.

01:26.242 --> 01:31.119
You are the four people in my life that I want to make the most proud of me.

01:32.347 --> 01:32.687
Thank you.

01:33.784 --> 01:36.851
And to my hero.

01:37.800 --> 01:38.766
That's who I chase.

01:39.248 --> 01:40.624
Now, when I was 15 years old,...

01:41.037 --> 01:43.268
...I had a very important person in my life come to me and say, "Who's your hero?"...

01:43.349 --> 01:44.487
...and I said, "I don't know, I gotta think about that."

01:44.588 --> 01:45.261
"Give me a couple of weeks."

01:45.336 --> 01:47.899
I come back two weeks later, this person comes up and says, "Who's your hero?"

01:48.234 --> 01:49.524
I said, "I thought about it, you know who it is?"

01:49.594 --> 01:51.247
I said, "It's me in ten years."

01:52.509 --> 01:53.746
So I turned 25.

01:53.869 --> 01:57.207
Ten years later, that same person comes to me and goes, "So, are you a hero?"

01:57.329 --> 01:59.113
And I was like, not even close.

01:59.867 --> 02:00.502
No, no, no.

02:00.687 --> 02:01.192
She said, "Why?"

02:01.253 --> 02:03.303
I said, "Because my hero's me at 35."

02:03.804 --> 02:06.620
So you see, every day, every week, every month and every year of my life,...

02:08.199 --> 02:09.319
...my hero's always ten years away.

02:09.459 --> 02:10.765
I'm never gonna be my hero.

02:11.266 --> 02:12.236
I'm not gonna attain that.

02:12.303 --> 02:14.039
I know I'm not, and that's just fine with me...

02:14.113 --> 02:17.083
...'cause that keeps me with somebody to keep on chasing.

02:18.038 --> 02:21.828
So, to any of us, whatever those things are, whatever it is we look up to,...

02:22.735 --> 02:26.493
...whatever it is we look forward to and whoever it is we're chasing, to that I say amen.

02:27.064 --> 02:29.003
To that I say all right, all right, all right.

02:31.105 --> 02:32.269
To that I say just keep living.

02:33.369 --> 02:33.749
Thank you.
