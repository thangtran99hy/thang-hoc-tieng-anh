ï»¿My name is Greg Vernick.

00:01.203 --> 00:04.706
I'm the chef and owner of Vernick Food and Drink here in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

00:05.527 --> 00:07.497
The food is very approachable, very simple,...

00:07.949 --> 00:08.695
...very seasonal.

00:09.519 --> 00:13.227
The CIA puts a huge emphasis on product knowledge.

00:13.509 --> 00:17.835
Produce, meat, fish, it's really about starting with the freshest product,...

00:18.363 --> 00:19.307
...the best in season,...

00:19.896 --> 00:20.851
...the best that we can find.

00:21.554 --> 00:23.330
The CIA teaches you that.

00:24.336 --> 00:26.572
People think simple is easy, and simple is not.

00:27.171 --> 00:28.746
You know, we don't have anything to hide behind.

00:29.963 --> 00:34.121
The CIA taught me to respect both the vocation and the ingredients,...

00:34.520 --> 00:36.987
...and I think about those things every day.
