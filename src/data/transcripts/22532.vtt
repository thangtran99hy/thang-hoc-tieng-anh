Technology businesses are like sharks, too.

00:03.006 --> 00:07.113
You either move forward ambitiously or poof!

00:07.754 --> 00:11.058
You become either small or irrelevant or both.

00:11.828 --> 00:13.803
I don't want either of those for Microsoft.

00:13.929 --> 00:18.310
My greatest joy in the long run for Microsoft...

00:18.761 --> 00:23.810
...well, to see it achieve even greater heights in the next five or ten years.

00:24.177 --> 00:27.413
I'm probably the biggest shareholder in Microsoft today.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.514
So what's my greatest wish?

00:30.699 --> 00:33.681
That Microsoft change in the way that keeps it successful.

00:34.391 --> 00:39.791
I think it is hard for technology companies to be successful if they are not ambitious.

00:40.399 --> 00:44.698
So the one thing I talk to everybody who we were considering to replace me...

00:45.297 --> 00:48.104
...is how ambitious they were for Microsoft.

00:48.596 --> 00:50.983
We had discussions with Facebook about buying Facebook.

00:51.108 --> 00:54.255
But Zuckerberg knew what he viewed as an outcome.

00:54.639 --> 00:59.127
That he really desired and was willing to put in the blood sweat and tears just like we were.

00:59.705 --> 01:01.928
So execution and measurement...

01:02.314 --> 01:07.015
...are hugely important yet people let themselves off the hook.
