My advice to young chefs from the age of 16 to sort of 29, 30 is:...

00:08.192 --> 00:11.347
...14 years of a sponge, you're absorbing knowledge.

00:11.728 --> 00:13.050
Don't take a job for the sake of money.

00:13.659 --> 00:17.607
Don't worry about earning 500 pounds a month or year, more, somewhere else.

00:18.051 --> 00:18.955
Go and get knowledge.

00:19.354 --> 00:22.055
'Cause that becomes a bigger passport for everything.

00:22.473 --> 00:26.149
The money will come once you've mastered your craft and you've become incredibly talented.

00:26.792 --> 00:31.567
Work for big chefs and find a different level of comfort.

00:32.177 --> 00:33.312
When things get too comfortable,...

00:33.384 --> 00:36.183
...when you're still living with your parents and you still got your first job and...

00:36.334 --> 00:38.471
...you don't wanna move out because everything is too comfortable, get out.

00:39.012 --> 00:41.346
Put yourself in a strange situation in the middle of Barcelona.

00:41.773 --> 00:42.727
Put yourself in the middle of Paris.

00:42.838 --> 00:45.305
Put yourself in the middle of Belgium and see what's available.

00:45.645 --> 00:47.667
And it's amazing how much confidence it gives you and more importantly,...

00:48.029 --> 00:50.642
...it's great to eat and travel at the same time.

00:51.140 --> 00:51.697
Fantastic.
