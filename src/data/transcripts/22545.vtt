ï»¿So Michael, you make some of the most amazing swords we've ever seen.

00:04.515 --> 00:05.692
It's an epic thing.

00:06.299 --> 00:07.343
How'd you get involved in this?

00:07.899 --> 00:11.969
Well, I was born in the 80s, so there was lots of fantasy movies when I was young and...

00:13.659 --> 00:15.921
...it was very hard in Ireland to buy a sword.

00:16.241 --> 00:19.447
I'm lucky that way that there was no Amazon.com or there was no...

00:19.512 --> 00:21.685
...I mean, I came from a small town so if I wanted a sword,...

00:22.101 --> 00:25.814
...the only way to make it was, the only way to get it was to make it.

00:26.064 --> 00:29.999
I have become the giant sword guy because you can't get them anywhere else.

00:30.116 --> 00:33.796
I'm the guy on planet Earth you have to come to if you want a big, giant sword.

00:34.346 --> 00:36.623
Who's your average customer and what are they looking for?

00:37.015 --> 00:38.339
They all like video games.

00:40.429 --> 00:42.163
They're looking for a giant sword but they can't buy it...

00:42.253 --> 00:44.811
...because they're too big to be mass-produced by China.

00:45.507 --> 00:47.935
And these are video game swords or weapons...

00:48.011 --> 00:50.819
...that people see and play these video games with...

00:50.901 --> 00:52.981
...and then they say, "I want the real thing."

00:53.391 --> 00:53.581
Yeah!

00:53.844 --> 00:57.258
So usually it's weird ones and the Buster Sword is too big,...

00:57.595 --> 00:58.595
...that's the mean one I make.

00:58.802 --> 01:00.193
That was 54 pounds.

01:00.451 --> 01:03.725
A historical sword whose been between three and five pounds.

01:04.817 --> 01:08.869
I got a bodybuilder here on the island to try and use this in the video,...

01:09.303 --> 01:11.521
...and I thought he'd be better at using it than me.

01:11.597 --> 01:16.126
But it turns out that at that weight and size, that the human body,...

01:16.673 --> 01:19.791
...54 pounds' worth of metal doesn't care how long you've been at the gym.
