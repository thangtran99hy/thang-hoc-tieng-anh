Ozlem sent me this Â£6 postcard from Turkey...

00:08.710 --> 00:13.005
...where she asked me if I had ever tried authentic Turkish coffee.

00:13.967 --> 00:14.684
And I hadn't.

00:16.259 --> 00:18.322
So I headed over to Izmir, Turkey...

00:18.645 --> 00:22.763
...to try the coffee that Ozlem says she absolutely adores.

00:30.933 --> 00:35.277
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city with three million people.

00:36.233 --> 00:39.431
It's known to ancient history as the City of Smyrna...

00:39.883 --> 00:44.398
...with 3,500 years of recorded human history.

00:45.400 --> 00:50.332
It's a center of art, culture, modernity and progressivism within Turkey.

00:51.053 --> 00:55.148
And it's considered one of Turkey's most forward-thinking cities.

00:55.981 --> 01:01.401
I chose it because its old town has a very high concentration of cafes and shops,...

01:01.708 --> 01:04.927
...many of which serve authentic Turkish coffee.
