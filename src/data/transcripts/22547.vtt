Trash versus garbage, is there a difference?

00:04.063 --> 00:08.869
Well, my grandmother taught me that trash means plastic, leaves, metal, tires, wood, etc....

00:09.091 --> 00:12.910
...and garbage means food waste, I guess what we might now call compost.

00:13.217 --> 00:16.297
This linguistic distinction wasn't something I'd ever learned in school.

00:16.575 --> 00:19.959
I mean, to me, this is a trash can and this is a garbage can.

00:20.231 --> 00:24.102
But the Oxford English Dictionary records "trash" as originally meaning broken...

00:24.209 --> 00:28.263
...or torn pieces of wood, twigs, splinters, cuttings from a hedge, straw, etc.,...

00:28.509 --> 00:33.156
...while "garbage" originally meant giblets of a fowl or entrails and waste parts of an animal.

00:33.351 --> 00:34.815
So grandma was right!

00:34.981 --> 00:39.825
These days, however, many of us in the US use the words "garbage" and "trash" interchangeably.

00:40.032 --> 00:43.188
And if you live in the British Isles, well, "rubbish."
