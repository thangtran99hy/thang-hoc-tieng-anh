00:03.961 --> 00:05.470
This is a country in motion.

00:09.428 --> 00:12.621
The land of hard work and independence.

00:14.103 --> 00:16.646
Its people bound only by their imagination.

00:17.485 --> 00:21.549
In Detroit, companies like Shinola are reconnecting with the past,...

00:22.163 --> 00:23.365
...building a better future.

00:24.140 --> 00:28.926
Because of entrepreneurship, Detroit is coming back one step at a time.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.909
By working with their hands, people are dreaming again.

00:33.925 --> 00:38.939
These are our people, our product, our power.

00:40.209 --> 00:41.183
This is our time.

00:46.051 --> 00:50.646
Shinola represents America at some level, I believe.

00:50.738 --> 00:54.785
It represents the notion that anything is possible.

00:54.965 --> 00:59.265
It shows that what this country was built on is real and is still here.

00:59.485 --> 01:03.670
The people of this city are what Shinola is so excited about...

01:03.743 --> 01:08.783
...and what really brought us here is the people's tenacity...

01:08.875 --> 01:13.689
...and they're willing to be part of such an interesting comeback.

01:14.139 --> 01:18.052
Bicycles and watches are an extension of oneself.

01:18.517 --> 01:21.263
I hope the legacy of Shinola would be that...

01:21.343 --> 01:26.629
...we're able to sustain and grow this great idea of making things in America...

01:26.699 --> 01:28.943
...and we can get more people on that bandwagon...

01:29.033 --> 01:30.205
...to support what we're doing.

01:30.663 --> 01:34.539
And that this is just the beginning of a stronger revival of Detroit...

01:34.677 --> 01:36.903
...and US manufacturing, not just in Detroit.

01:37.474 --> 01:39.586
It's that thing that's coming back:...

01:40.466 --> 01:43.807
...the reinvigoration of manufacturing in America...

01:43.906 --> 01:47.359
...and showing the world that it might have left our shores,...

01:47.454 --> 01:51.443
...but it's still here and we're still here and we're doing it again.
