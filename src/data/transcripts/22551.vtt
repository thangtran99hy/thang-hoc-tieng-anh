00:00.104 --> 00:03.852
These are the type of dragons from myths and legends across Asia.

00:03.939 --> 00:06.477
In contrast to their Western counterparts,...

00:06.781 --> 00:10.935
...these dragons are not known to eat people or attack a castle...

00:11.031 --> 00:13.816
...or chase a bunch of dwarves out of their homes for their gold.

00:13.971 --> 00:18.523
In Western culture, the dragons represent evil and darkness.

00:18.612 --> 00:21.185
Unlike the celestial images of the Eastern dragon,...

00:21.264 --> 00:24.258
...the Western dragon has sharp teeth and strong legs.

00:24.556 --> 00:28.485
It is said to bring harm, suffering, and fear to humankind.

00:28.649 --> 00:32.735
In China, as well as in most places in Asia, the dragon or "long",...

00:32.941 --> 00:39.452
...as said in Chinese, is commonly the symbol of nobility, solemness, holiness, and good fortune.

00:39.820 --> 00:42.151
Throughout the history of China, Korea, and Japan,...

00:42.220 --> 00:47.973
...the dragon, or the concept of the dragon, has been a part of people's daily lives.

00:48.285 --> 00:52.495
The dragon has existed wherever Chinese culture existed.

00:52.931 --> 00:58.001
And the Chinese eventually began calling themselves the descendants of the dragon.
