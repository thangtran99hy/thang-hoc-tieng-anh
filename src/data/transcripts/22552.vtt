00:00.022 --> 00:04.429
My first job on Wall Street was a summer internship at Credit Suisse First Boston.

00:04.543 --> 00:07.177
And I was 22 and I was like a total mess.

00:11.127 --> 00:13.543
I ended up getting sober from drugs and alcohol...

00:13.635 --> 00:18.128
...and calling this counselor who started working with me on the spiritual path.

00:18.309 --> 00:21.704
I started on Wall Street and my first bonus was 40,000 dollars.

00:21.835 --> 00:23.075
And I was so excited.

00:23.163 --> 00:26.470
I mean, can you imagine like for the first time getting this check...

00:26.692 --> 00:29.498
...that all of a sudden, it means I'm not living paycheck to paycheck...

00:29.601 --> 00:32.595
...and I just felt like okay for the first time in my life.

00:32.730 --> 00:34.231
I had this super cool life...

00:34.311 --> 00:37.760
...and I was kind of making more and more money and rising up the ranks,...

00:38.212 --> 00:41.489
...but at the same time, five years into my career on Wall Street,...

00:41.563 --> 00:46.974
...I'd come in and I'd sit at my desk and I would just be consumed with envy and jealousy.

00:47.199 --> 00:51.144
And I would look at these guys around me that made so much more money than I did.

00:51.229 --> 00:55.601
And even though all of a sudden I was making 500,000 dollars or 1,000,000 dollars that year,...

00:55.885 --> 00:58.776
...I'd look at the guys that were making 2 million or 10 million.

00:58.880 --> 01:00.507
And I'd just like burn with envy.

01:03.499 --> 01:09.567
So, that's when I started to get a sense that, "Maybe this is like an addiction."

01:09.687 --> 01:10.829
So, what's the point of this?

01:11.084 --> 01:14.566
You know, you're spending your whole life being really smart...

01:14.652 --> 01:16.733
...and making these really crucial decisions,...

01:16.821 --> 01:21.939
...but at the end of the day, all you're doing is sort of making more money with money.

01:22.168 --> 01:25.499
When I was on Wall Street, the most important thing in the world for me...

01:25.567 --> 01:28.840
...was whether or not I was gonna make one or two million dollars that year.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.836
And the longer I've spent away from Wall Street,...

01:30.919 --> 01:34.616
...the more I've come to see how sort of distorted that was.

01:34.747 --> 01:36.608
And I'm not saying that money is bad.

01:36.694 --> 01:40.063
Money is great and it's always better to have more money than less money.

01:40.165 --> 01:43.263
If you're like me and you have this hole in your heart,...

01:43.338 --> 01:45.350
...this sort of brokenness inside,...

01:45.745 --> 01:50.787
...and are trying to fix it by proving to the world that you or I is valuable,...

01:51.135 --> 01:52.344
...it just doesn't work.
