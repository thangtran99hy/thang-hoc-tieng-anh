00:06.768 --> 00:08.324
It's a beautiful fall evening.

00:09.624 --> 00:10.387
The sun is setting.

00:11.407 --> 00:13.065
The dog finally stopped barking.

00:15.114 --> 00:15.647
Life is good.

00:17.665 --> 00:22.355
But inside, there's trouble brewing and Emma has no idea.

00:23.181 --> 00:25.524
Although she feels fine, like her father,...

00:25.973 --> 00:31.170
...Emma is one of the 67 million adults in the US with high blood pressure or hypertension.

00:32.445 --> 00:34.457
Just like her radiator that's on the fritz,...

00:35.104 --> 00:37.805
...Emma's heart is working overtime to get the job done.

00:38.533 --> 00:39.119
Let's have a look.

00:40.126 --> 00:42.143
The heart is the pump in our bodies,...

00:42.562 --> 00:48.430
...delivering blood to the entire system through a set of pipes or blood vessels of all sizes.

00:49.119 --> 00:55.370
Smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity, family history,...

00:55.452 --> 00:58.666
...and increased age all contribute to these blood vessels...

00:58.932 --> 01:01.287
...or our pipes becoming less elastic.

01:01.646 --> 01:05.476
The more blood our heart has to pump through stiff narrowing arteries,....

01:05.937 --> 01:07.143
...the higher our blood pressure.

01:07.605 --> 01:10.907
When the force on the blood against our artery walls is too high,...

01:11.280 --> 01:13.628
...life-threatening health problems can result.

01:14.014 --> 01:18.747
Problems like kidney disease, heart disease, stroke, even heart attack.

01:19.341 --> 01:22.125
Can Emma get her pressure down before it's too late?
