ï»¿Long before any birds were angry or candy was crushed,...

00:05.393 --> 00:08.449
...Tetris was among the first habit-forming puzzle games.

00:08.647 --> 00:12.024
But a new study in the journal Appetite suggests the classic block game...

00:12.115 --> 00:15.053
...could actually break some of your other habits.

00:15.283 --> 00:18.709
The theory of elaborated intrusion holds that our cravings...

00:18.797 --> 00:21.333
...come from visual cues that pop into our heads.

00:21.418 --> 00:25.584
So, researchers at Plymouth University decided to test if other visual stimulus,...

00:25.691 --> 00:28.812
...like a heavy game of Tetris, could help curb our desire...

00:28.981 --> 00:31.929
...for a drink, cigarette or an unhealthy snack.

00:32.254 --> 00:35.130
After two groups of volunteers reported similar cravings,...

00:35.210 --> 00:36.650
...they had one group play the game...

00:36.674 --> 00:39.400
...while the other sat with a screen that never finished loading.

00:39.588 --> 00:43.667
Afterward, the participants who had actually played Tetris for at least three minutes...

00:43.722 --> 00:46.673
...reported as much as 24% fewer cravings,...

00:46.855 --> 00:50.182
...suggesting the game helped keep out those unwanted visuals.
