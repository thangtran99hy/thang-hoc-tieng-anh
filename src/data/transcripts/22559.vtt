00:00.050 --> 00:01.731
Is your job about to get automated?

00:02.035 --> 00:02.796
Yes, probably.

00:02.860 --> 00:04.937
It's already happening in some unexpected places.

00:05.070 --> 00:06.593
See if your occupation is safe.

00:09.024 --> 00:11.252
In an interview last week with the American Enterprise Institute,...

00:11.385 --> 00:14.123
...Bill Gates confirmed that yes, the rumors are true.

00:14.320 --> 00:15.862
Robots will be taking your jobs.

00:16.198 --> 00:23.288
Software substitution, whether it's for drivers or waiters or nurses...

00:23.436 --> 00:25.421
...or even whatever it is you do.

00:25.632 --> 00:28.075
But what occupations specifically are at risk?

00:28.196 --> 00:30.941
Well, let's take a look at where some automation is already happening.

00:31.183 --> 00:34.235
First up, you may have heard there was an earthquake in LA earlier this week.

00:34.353 --> 00:37.456
Breaking the story unwittingly were these anchors from KTLA.

00:37.577 --> 00:38.680
We're having an earthquake.

00:39.774 --> 00:41.761
But the first article published about the quake...

00:41.829 --> 00:44.727
...was actually generated by an algorithm from the LA Times,...

00:44.851 --> 00:46.087
...plugging in just the key facts.

00:46.337 --> 00:51.328
4.7 quake, Monday morning, Westwood, California, 6:25 AM, etc.

00:51.489 --> 00:54.119
That robo article posted just a short few minutes after the quake...

00:54.210 --> 00:58.735
...and the LA Times says that they use algorithms for homicides or other breaking news stories,...

00:58.857 --> 01:00.631
...and you can probably expect this trend to continue.

01:00.781 --> 01:05.493
But nothing can ever replace the pure sensitivity and emotion of human reporters, right?

01:06.298 --> 01:06.699
Right?
