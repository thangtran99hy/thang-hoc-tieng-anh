Have you ever wondered what the difference is between the words "between" and "among"...

00:10.329 --> 00:13.864
...and if you can use them interchangeably or if you need to choose one?

00:14.072 --> 00:16.102
Well, the answer is that they are different...

00:16.268 --> 00:20.019
...and you use them in a different way in different sentences.

00:20.551 --> 00:26.986
As a rule of thumb, "between" is used when you're talking about two people or two things.

00:27.579 --> 00:32.415
You use "among" if you're talking about more than two people or more than two things.

00:32.673 --> 00:36.577
And I like to remember this by thinking of two cliches actually.

00:36.977 --> 00:40.909
We tend to not like cliches in writing but sometimes they can be good memory devices.

00:47.296 --> 00:50.679
One is the phrase "Just between you and me."

00:51.051 --> 00:56.369
Well, "between" is correct here because we're talking about you and me.

00:56.487 --> 00:59.538
We're just two people so it's just between you and me.

00:59.843 --> 01:04.197
And that's one way that you can remember that "between" is used for two people.

01:09.808 --> 01:14.053
On the other hand, we have a sentence like "You are among friends."

01:14.582 --> 01:18.884
In this case, you might picture a large group of friends more than two.

01:19.231 --> 01:21.569
And that's why we use the word "among"...

01:21.692 --> 01:24.572
...to indicate that we're talking about a bigger group of people.

01:24.945 --> 01:28.811
So again, if you're wondering about the difference between "between" and "among",...

01:29.024 --> 01:31.989
...remember that "between" is used for two people,...

01:32.088 --> 01:35.964
...and "among" is used for a larger group, more than two people.
