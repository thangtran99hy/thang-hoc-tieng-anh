A lot of people think that "each other" and "one another" can be used interchangeably.

00:11.113 --> 00:14.818
But actually, they mean different things and they're used in different ways.

00:15.229 --> 00:16.787
The easiest way to remember it...

00:17.071 --> 00:22.766
...is that "each other" is used when we're talking about two people or two things,...

00:23.153 --> 00:28.195
...and "one another" is used when we're talking about more than two people or a group of things.

00:29.868 --> 00:34.710
Here's an example of how the two of these phrases would function in a sentence.

00:35.867 --> 00:38.036
My mom and I talk to each other.

00:38.458 --> 00:43.158
Well, my mom and I are just two people, so we talk to each other.

00:45.956 --> 00:49.196
However, my family members write to one another.

00:49.443 --> 00:52.023
In this case, I'm talking about my entire family,...

00:52.121 --> 00:53.837
...more than two family members.

00:54.229 --> 00:57.763
And when we correspond, we correspond with one another.

00:59.916 --> 01:03.359
So I hope that clears up the difference between "each other" and "one another",...

01:03.493 --> 01:05.464
...and helps you choose the right one for you.
