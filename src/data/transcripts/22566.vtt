Hi, I'm Sally and I'm gonna show you how to make the gooeiest of brownies.

00:07.306 --> 00:09.839
These are the ingredients you're going to need.

00:10.561 --> 00:14.127
The chocolates and butter I've melted in the microwave for two minutes on high.

00:14.716 --> 00:17.463
You want to whisk the eggs with the sugar.

00:19.089 --> 00:22.575
You got a nice, creamy, ribbony texture there.

00:23.502 --> 00:24.140
Perfect!

00:26.447 --> 00:34.358
Now, in goes the flour and the cocoa powder.

00:36.368 --> 00:41.087
Using a spatula, just fold that through in a figure of eight.

00:43.174 --> 00:47.674
And at this point, start pouring in the butter and chocolate.

00:48.789 --> 00:54.001
And then, it's gonna go into greased and lined baking tin,...

00:54.226 --> 00:59.585
...cooked at 180 degrees centigrade for between 30 and 35 minutes..
