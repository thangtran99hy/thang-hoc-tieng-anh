I know you mentioned lately that you'd be quite excited...

00:02.626 --> 00:06.225
...to slip back on the Jedi robes for Mace Windu.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.126
Is that something that you think might happen?

00:08.214 --> 00:09.663
Is that something you'd like to talk to J.J. about?

00:10.132 --> 00:12.502
Yeah, I'd like to be in a new "Star Wars".

00:12.639 --> 00:14.167
I don't know if it will happen or won't happen.

00:15.541 --> 00:20.897
There's a huge debate about whether they should create a whole bunch of new characters...

00:21.013 --> 00:25.049
...and not deal with the old or there's another school of thought...

00:25.167 --> 00:28.322
...where it's easier to bring people into the new "Star Wars" fold...

00:28.421 --> 00:32.052
...by introducing, reintroducing some of the older characters and bringing them in.

00:33.843 --> 00:34.398
I don't know.

00:36.389 --> 00:37.493
I'd love to be a part of it.

00:37.587 --> 00:39.157
If I'm not, I'll still go see it.

00:40.388 --> 00:44.225
But it would be great to be something in it, yeah.
