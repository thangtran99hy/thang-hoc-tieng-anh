By working with Lady Gaga, obviously, you know...

00:02.231 --> 00:08.032
...her fans open up and a lot of them like my music and go to my shows.

00:08.905 --> 00:10.604
And that's a great thing for me...

00:10.703 --> 00:16.255
...because I don't always want to stick with the small amount of fans that like, go and try dance music.

00:16.595 --> 00:19.977
I wanted the metalheads to love my songs and be able to go to my shows...

00:20.065 --> 00:24.719
...and I want older people that probably have never heard electronic music before...

00:25.165 --> 00:27.410
...to at least be able to find something interesting...

00:27.502 --> 00:31.141
...because my music is, you can play it on the piano, that's what I sometimes do.

00:31.741 --> 00:35.059
So I do acoustic versions to show that there's a whole another layer...

00:35.151 --> 00:37.017
...that you don't probably hear because the kick drum is loud.
