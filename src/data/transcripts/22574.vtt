Healthcare.gov works great now.

00:02.812 --> 00:06.613
And millions of Americans have already gotten health insurance plans...

00:06.735 --> 00:11.584
...and what we want is for people to know that you can get affordable healthcare.

00:11.677 --> 00:14.400
And most young Americans right now, they're not covered.

00:15.094 --> 00:18.002
And the truth is that they can get coverage,...

00:18.144 --> 00:23.242
...all for what it costs you to pay your cell phone bill.

00:23.370 --> 00:25.104
Is this what they mean by drones?

00:25.194 --> 00:29.097
The point is that a lot of young people, they think they're invincible.

00:29.595 --> 00:31.317
Did you say invisible?

00:32.719 --> 00:36.123
No, no, not invisible; invincible,...

00:37.501 --> 00:39.398
...meaning that they don't think they can get hurt.

00:39.521 --> 00:42.289
I'm just saying that nobody could be invisible, if you had said invisible.

00:42.363 --> 00:43.119
I understand that.

00:44.479 --> 00:47.023
If they get that health insurance, they can really make a big difference,...

00:47.099 --> 00:49.029
...and they've got until March 31st to sign up.

00:49.141 --> 00:50.807
I don't have a computer so how does...

00:51.036 --> 00:55.087
Well, then you can call 1-800-318-2596.

00:55.427 --> 00:57.006
I don't have a phone, I'm off the grid,...

00:57.377 --> 01:00.171
...I don't want you people like, looking at my texts, if you know what I mean?
