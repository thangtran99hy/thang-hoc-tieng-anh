Have you ever heard your parents say that a penny saved is a penny earned?

00:06.998 --> 00:11.740
Like most kids, I'm sure you're getting the point where you have lots of pennies.

00:14.879 --> 00:18.176
I bet you even have a piggy bank where you keep all your pennies.

00:33.247 --> 00:38.024
And from time to time, daydream about what to spend your pennies on.

00:49.965 --> 00:54.570
I remember my father telling me that money is like toothpaste in a tube.

00:55.177 --> 00:59.723
It's easy to squeeze out and use but almost impossible to put back in.

01:02.185 --> 01:07.865
So before running out and spending your saved money on something that won't last, think twice.

01:15.076 --> 01:17.868
After all, a hundred pennies makes a dollar.

01:18.291 --> 01:22.739
And it takes considerable work to make or save a dollar in today's world.

01:23.671 --> 01:27.617
Make sure you spend your money on things that are important and will last.

01:28.443 --> 01:30.962
This is the first lesson of saving and spending;...

01:31.557 --> 01:33.449
...and often the most difficult to learn.
