What do Nintendo, Garmin, Anheuser-Busch InBev and Bloomberg all have in common?

00:09.655 --> 00:10.977
They all are recognizable brands,...

00:11.142 --> 00:16.163
...but what you might not know is that all of them have been founded or run by billionaires.

00:16.393 --> 00:18.391
Billionaires you may never have heard of.

00:18.634 --> 00:22.919
Hiroshi Yamauchi from Japan turned Mario and Luigi into household names.

00:23.303 --> 00:26.829
Yamauchi is credited with turning Nintendo from a small card company...

00:27.052 --> 00:30.127
...into a multibillion dollar video console entertainment system.

00:30.513 --> 00:33.866
The former president is currently the largest individual shareholder.

00:34.042 --> 00:36.782
For a lot of these people, they're just normal people, down-to-earth people...

00:37.129 --> 00:40.034
...and they want to keep their families and their children out of the limelight...

00:40.206 --> 00:42.928
...so they actively avoid giving interviews...

00:43.073 --> 00:45.207
...and that's part of the reason why you haven't heard of them.

00:45.659 --> 00:49.409
Then, there's Brazilian beer brewing billionaire, Jorge Paulo Lemann.

00:49.579 --> 00:51.737
A strategic investment in 1989...

00:51.839 --> 00:55.779
...allowed this billionaire to have a controlling stake in Anheuser-Busch InBev,...

00:56.037 --> 01:00.853
...which produces famous global brands like Stella, Becks and of course Budweiser.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.993
And everyone knows billionaire Mike Bloomberg,...

01:03.112 --> 01:06.423
...but his cofounder Thomas Secunda flies under the radar.

01:06.716 --> 01:10.627
Thomas Secunda was more of a programmer and he helped to build the prototype...

01:10.737 --> 01:13.907
...that became the now ubiquitous Bloomberg terminal.
