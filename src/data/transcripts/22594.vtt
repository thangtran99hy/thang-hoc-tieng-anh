Today, we boarded a ferry to Gorée Island which is just off the coast of Senegal.

00:14.932 --> 00:18.851
Now for roughly 300 years until the mid-1840s,...

00:19.465 --> 00:22.329
...millions of men, women, and children from Africa...

00:22.441 --> 00:24.953
...were kidnapped from their homes and communities...

00:25.368 --> 00:29.094
...and brought to this island to be sold as slaves.

00:30.546 --> 00:32.661
Now on the island, we saw cells...

00:32.831 --> 00:36.743
...where dozens of people were packed together for months on end.

00:37.458 --> 00:40.975
We saw the courtyard where they were forced to stand naked...

00:41.523 --> 00:44.995
...while buyers examined them, negotiated a price,...

00:45.184 --> 00:48.109
...and bought them as if they were nothing but property.

00:48.534 --> 00:51.727
There is no way to undo what happened on Gorée Island,...

00:51.852 --> 00:56.030
...and no way to erase the stain of slavery from our nation's past.

00:56.659 --> 01:02.843
But there is also no denying the course that history has taken since that time.

01:03.965 --> 01:09.678
Since then, we've seen so many brave men and women rise up against slavery...

01:09.911 --> 01:14.658
...and segregation and injustice and inequality of all kinds.

01:15.501 --> 01:21.758
People who came through this island could never have imagined how history would unfold...

01:22.669 --> 01:26.371
...and they certainly could never have imagined that someone like me,...

01:27.062 --> 01:33.307
...a descendant of slaves, would come here and look back through that door of no return.
