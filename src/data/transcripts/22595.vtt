There I was being a regular kid until I was nine.

00:09.503 --> 00:14.891
And one weekend, we went to the Hayden Planetarium right here in New York City.

00:15.745 --> 00:18.175
And right, it's just another museum...

00:18.260 --> 00:22.815
...until they turn out the lights and the stars come out.

00:24.348 --> 00:28.233
Back then, space shows were live and so there's this voice,...

00:28.798 --> 00:31.882
..."We are now in the universe and here are the stars."

00:32.936 --> 00:35.035
You're looking up, you don't see anybody, you just hear this voice...

00:35.101 --> 00:36.591
...so it's like, "The universe is talking to me."

00:37.601 --> 00:40.653
And there was a sky unlike that which I've ever seen,...

00:41.153 --> 00:42.942
...having been born and raised in New York.

00:43.694 --> 00:47.871
And there you are, immersed, bathed in the cosmos.

00:48.989 --> 00:53.307
And that can be quite influential on a nine-year-old, as it was on me.
