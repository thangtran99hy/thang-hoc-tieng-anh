00:00.669 --> 00:02.677
Humanity has come to an important decision.

00:03.507 --> 00:04.835
Two futures stand before us.

00:05.847 --> 00:07.550
We can continue on our current path...

00:08.041 --> 00:11.523
...where we rely on outdated electricity grids, inefficient buildings...

00:11.850 --> 00:16.449
...and dirty power plants that contaminate our air, or we can change.

00:17.009 --> 00:21.832
We can create greener cities where solar panels and wind turbines power our homes,...

00:22.280 --> 00:24.559
...where buildings use less energy and save money...

00:25.212 --> 00:28.751
...where our air and water are cleaner, our quality of life is better...

00:29.065 --> 00:30.366
...and our economy is stronger.

00:31.569 --> 00:36.904
And here's the thing: this cleaner, more sustainable future is within our grasp.

00:37.771 --> 00:40.589
To get there, we need to rethink old conventions,...

00:40.943 --> 00:44.610
...improve energy efficiency and invest in green technology.

00:45.470 --> 00:48.898
Most of all, we need to stand up for the future we deserve.

00:49.920 --> 00:50.423
Join us.

00:51.085 --> 00:53.099
It's time to green our cities.
