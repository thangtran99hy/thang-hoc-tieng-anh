I played piano when I was four until I was 18 and then I started violin,...

00:08.651 --> 00:16.890
...and it's a really beautiful way to express passion and it's a great communicator.

00:18.521 --> 00:21.961
I think it's probably the closest instrument you can get...

00:22.030 --> 00:23.275
...to sounding like the human voice.

00:24.175 --> 00:27.157
It's incredibly beautiful and romantic and expressive.

00:28.213 --> 00:30.169
I went to a concert the other day and I found myself...

00:30.294 --> 00:33.703
...silently sitting in the audience crying because it was so incredibly beautiful.

00:35.284 --> 00:38.399
As a performer, you can stand up on the stage...

00:38.457 --> 00:41.304
...and really make people feel things that you want them to feel,...

00:41.635 --> 00:42.995
...and that's what I love about it.

00:44.081 --> 00:48.031
My violin is probably my best friend, it's there for me through everything.

00:48.116 --> 00:54.012
And whenever I'm feeling iffy, I can go play my violin and...

00:54.083 --> 00:57.844
...it distracts me from everything day-to-day.
