I just moved in to a new house, so I've just been enjoying the pad.

00:07.978 --> 00:12.081
There's three of us that live here, and we are all artists, so that's pretty rad.

00:12.431 --> 00:16.639
We have a lot of extra room to work on music, do art, paint,...

00:17.043 --> 00:18.381
...whatever you can get your hands on.

00:18.919 --> 00:20.401
I actually majored in photography,...

00:20.729 --> 00:22.596
...but mostly I've been getting into music lately.

00:25.851 --> 00:26.831
This is really out of tune.

00:28.343 --> 00:31.053
I'm learning to play the drums, it's going poorly.

00:32.115 --> 00:35.365
But sooner rather than later hopefully, I'll be pretty good.

00:38.395 --> 00:42.916
I'm just thinking about my past relationships and how poorly they've all gone.

00:44.360 --> 00:51.016
I've been single for like, four months now, and that's pretty great, I guess.
