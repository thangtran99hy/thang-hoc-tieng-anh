00:00.555 --> 00:01.340
I don't even know.

00:01.927 --> 00:04.961
Very spontaneous, it just happens as it goes, I guess.

00:05.231 --> 00:06.319
I can be in a routine though.

00:06.894 --> 00:11.986
So typically for me, it's work, nine to whenever I get off, I guess.

00:12.123 --> 00:16.913
And sometimes I'll go out, and then other times, I'll just go home...

00:17.027 --> 00:18.417
...because I don't feel like going out.

00:18.875 --> 00:22.759
And then on the weekends, that's when I come back to life.

00:24.515 --> 00:26.651
So there's a thing called "cuffing season."

00:27.833 --> 00:32.557
And that's when basically it gets cold outside, and you don't really want to be out late...

00:32.669 --> 00:35.832
...because the sun goes down early, and you just want to be at home.

00:36.045 --> 00:37.161
You don't want to be home by yourself,...

00:37.675 --> 00:44.145
...so you get with someone and I guess, you kind of hibernate with them in a way.

00:44.350 --> 00:47.257
So my relationships seem a little short.

00:49.109 --> 00:51.035
I'm not proud to admit that, but I don't know why.

00:51.146 --> 00:53.039
I think it's because I'm always busy, I'm always on the go,...

00:53.099 --> 00:58.187
...so I don't really give them as much attention as I probably should.

00:58.583 --> 01:01.257
But I'm getting a little older and a little bit more mature,...

01:01.319 --> 01:06.895
...so I think I'm starting to be able to like, balance work life and having fun...

01:07.022 --> 01:09.308
...and being like, serious and committed.

01:09.398 --> 01:10.958
So hopefully this season, I'll change.
