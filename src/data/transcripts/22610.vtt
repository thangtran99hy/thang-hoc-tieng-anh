00:02.152 --> 00:05.061
So many battles waged over the years.

00:07.461 --> 00:10.767
And yet, none of them like this.

00:12.097 --> 00:14.550
Are we destined to destroy each other?

00:15.224 --> 00:19.100
Or can we change who we are and unite?

00:19.804 --> 00:22.133
Is the future truly set?

00:34.354 --> 00:38.941
Mutants, we now find ourselves on the edge of extinction.

00:42.072 --> 00:43.956
You'll need to go into the past.

00:44.385 --> 00:47.634
To end this war before it ever begins.

00:56.503 --> 00:59.753
Use your power bring the X-Men together.

01:04.427 --> 01:05.810
It's going to take the two of us...

01:06.918 --> 01:09.883
...side by side, at a time when we couldn't be further apart.

01:15.047 --> 01:17.045
You took the things that mean the most to me.

01:19.121 --> 01:21.261
Maybe you should have fought harder for them.

01:24.366 --> 01:26.156
There is a new enemy out there.

01:26.233 --> 01:26.939
Mutants.

01:27.062 --> 01:28.637
You'll need a new weapon for this war.

01:28.723 --> 01:29.909
I know what I have to do.

01:30.136 --> 01:31.036
It's us or them.

01:38.365 --> 01:41.745
All those years wasted fighting each other, Charles.

01:44.293 --> 01:45.747
I've watched a lot of people die.

01:46.432 --> 01:47.069
Friends.

01:53.351 --> 01:55.141
We've been given a second chance.

02:00.615 --> 02:01.345
Guide us.

02:01.981 --> 02:02.685
Lead us.

02:04.029 --> 02:06.198
I don't want your future!

02:07.506 --> 02:09.447
We were supposed to protect them.

02:13.780 --> 02:14.869
You're afraid.

02:15.596 --> 02:16.622
I remember.
