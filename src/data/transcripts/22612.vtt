00:00.260 --> 00:04.233
The Easter Island moai are absolutely magnificent.

00:04.313 --> 00:09.221
They're huge carved structures, they're carved out of solid rock.

00:09.576 --> 00:15.042
The largest erected moai are about 10 meters or 33 feet tall.

00:15.211 --> 00:19.693
They've been estimated, the large ones, to weigh up to 75 tons or more.

00:20.181 --> 00:26.479
And how the Easter Islanders did this is absolutely startling and enigmatic.

00:27.339 --> 00:29.061
They even had bigger plans actually.

00:29.322 --> 00:32.461
In the quarry, you can observe an unfinished moai.

00:32.816 --> 00:41.435
And that unfinished moai is under order of 21 meters long, about 69 feet...

00:41.565 --> 00:44.803
...and estimated to weigh over 250 tons.

00:45.501 --> 00:50.233
How they erected these, how they carved them, is still a mystery.

00:51.002 --> 00:54.500
If you ask the native Easter Islanders how it was done,...

00:55.113 --> 01:00.080
...as Europeans have asked for the last 200 plus years,...

01:00.799 --> 01:04.405
...they don't give you a, quote, "rational, Western" explanation.

01:04.865 --> 01:06.769
They say it was done by mana...

01:07.309 --> 01:10.819
...and that statues walked to their locations,...

01:11.166 --> 01:13.273
...or that it was simply mana.

01:13.374 --> 01:17.131
What they mean by that is there's a supernatural or spiritual...

01:17.206 --> 01:20.460
...or we might call psychic force that moved,...

01:20.747 --> 01:23.397
...somehow transported the statues.
