00:00.349 --> 00:02.120
What are you interested in in science?

00:02.407 --> 00:03.833
Well, I like genetics.

00:04.048 --> 00:06.923
My high school teacher actually started my interest in genetics...

00:07.063 --> 00:09.319
...but I still have a lot to learn about the field.

00:09.582 --> 00:11.241
Well, I started my own career in genetics...

00:11.400 --> 00:14.347
...and then I decided that the brain was where all the action was...

00:14.449 --> 00:16.324
...so I became a neurogeneticist.

00:16.449 --> 00:20.768
Still to this day, study genes that control brain, behavior, activity...

00:20.880 --> 00:22.273
...and especially Alzheimer's disease.

00:22.483 --> 00:24.151
So what would you say your motivation is?

00:24.590 --> 00:25.899
I think after you live your whole life...

00:25.971 --> 00:29.959
...and you develop all these memories and personality and who you are,...

00:30.028 --> 00:33.185
...it's not fair that a disease comes and robs exactly that from you.

00:33.497 --> 00:35.953
And robs it from everyone who loves you and knows you.

00:36.223 --> 00:40.411
So I'm motivated by the need to just eradicate this disease from the planet.

00:40.907 --> 00:44.042
What is the best advice that anyone has ever given you?

00:44.767 --> 00:47.525
Don't be afraid to think wildly...

00:47.623 --> 00:51.640
...and speculate wildly in the privacy and silence of your own brain...

00:52.163 --> 00:55.447
...'cause you can then decide what you're going to say out to others.

00:55.550 --> 00:57.953
So, allow yourself to make free associations...

00:58.027 --> 00:59.715
...'cause that's where some of the best ideas come from.

00:59.869 --> 01:02.287
The second part of that is that when you go into the lab,...

01:02.671 --> 01:03.893
...if you wanna do good science,...

01:04.095 --> 01:06.767
...your only job is to disprove what you think.

01:07.110 --> 01:09.367
My original mentor at Harvard told me,...

01:09.561 --> 01:11.511
..."Date your hypothesis, never marry it."

01:12.305 --> 01:15.497
Always be open to revising what you think.
