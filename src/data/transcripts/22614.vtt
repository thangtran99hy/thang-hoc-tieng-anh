I think Earth Day is important...

00:01.831 --> 00:05.224
...because we have to try and work to keep the world beautiful.

00:05.307 --> 00:07.647
You know, with all the machines and all the technology,...

00:07.891 --> 00:09.150
...we kind of forget about nature.

00:09.441 --> 00:12.765
So I think it's important to keep the green things alive,...

00:12.864 --> 00:14.521
...to keep the beautiful things alive.

00:14.731 --> 00:15.699
I love nature.

00:15.918 --> 00:16.687
I love plants.

00:16.764 --> 00:17.639
I love flowers.

00:18.007 --> 00:22.710
They're great and just to help nature out, to help Earth.

00:22.902 --> 00:25.612
I think it's important, firstly,  to give back to your community.

00:26.046 --> 00:28.499
It helps create a better community to be a part of.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.544
If we don't get out into the community, then we're stuck in our own world,...

00:31.633 --> 00:34.831
...and we don't really experience life in college,...

00:34.902 --> 00:36.609
...and we don't really learn as much as we could.

00:37.083 --> 00:40.613
It brings an awareness to people that plants are needed,...

00:40.703 --> 00:42.763
...there's Earth that we live on.

00:43.065 --> 00:45.979
And without that place, we won't be living anywhere else.

00:46.087 --> 00:49.622
So we need to take care of our place and Mother Nature.
