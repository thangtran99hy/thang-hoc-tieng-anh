Hey guys, summer's here and it's my favorite time of year.

00:03.876 --> 00:07.532
I love to entertain in the summer 'cause the days are hot and the nights are warm,...

00:07.763 --> 00:10.672
...and you can have people hanging out at your house super late into the night.

00:11.001 --> 00:14.609
I've put together a really simple menu that's great for entertaining.

00:14.959 --> 00:17.623
You're using your grill, lots of fresh herbs,...

00:17.727 --> 00:20.712
...and it's gonna be your guests' best meal of the summer.

00:21.281 --> 00:24.304
We're gonna kick things off with my Paloma cocktail,...

00:24.580 --> 00:27.317
...a refreshing drink that comes together in minutes.

00:27.727 --> 00:31.745
Then, I'll show you how to make my delicious herb-marinated feta,...

00:32.035 --> 00:34.601
...the perfect first course to set the summer mood.

00:35.149 --> 00:39.527
Then, for our main course, it's grilled skirt steak with a chimichurri sauce,...

00:39.719 --> 00:41.575
...a classic summertime flavor.

00:41.991 --> 00:47.403
And for our side dish, a summery watermelon salad with cucumber, lime and basil.

00:47.673 --> 00:52.885
And for dessert, it's plum clafoutis with amaretto whipped cream and toasted almonds.
