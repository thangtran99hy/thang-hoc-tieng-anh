It's not hard to imagine why people flock to Holland on foot, by bike,...

00:04.923 --> 00:07.259
...and well, on pretty much anything with wheels...

00:07.397 --> 00:10.761
...when winter is finally over and the country springs to life.

00:11.347 --> 00:16.473
This legendary land of water and windmills is after all the tulip capital of the world.

00:16.933 --> 00:19.581
And nowhere are they more brilliant and beautiful...

00:19.724 --> 00:24.809
...than along the 40-kilometer route of Holland's flower parade, the Bloemencorso,...

00:25.195 --> 00:27.634
...or at the famed Keukenhof Gardens.

00:28.257 --> 00:32.715
Each year at the end of April, more than a million people, many of them tourists,...

00:33.004 --> 00:36.681
...line the roads of the Dutch countryside south of Amsterdam.

00:37.185 --> 00:40.065
They're here to welcome what's known as the "Face of Spring."

00:40.920 --> 00:43.265
It's a phenomenal show of flower power:...

00:43.410 --> 00:46.461
...from fire-breathing dragons to flights of fancy.

00:46.986 --> 00:50.659
Its massive floats and marching bands take all day to wend their way...

00:50.750 --> 00:52.890
...through well over a dozen Dutch villages,...

00:53.403 --> 00:55.771
...sometimes to a distinctly tropical beat.

00:57.033 --> 01:01.221
But where green thumbs really go big each spring is at the Keukenhof...

01:01.790 --> 01:05.702
...where some 7 million bulbs are hand planted each fall...

01:05.793 --> 01:09.156
...and erupt into elaborate shows of color come spring.
