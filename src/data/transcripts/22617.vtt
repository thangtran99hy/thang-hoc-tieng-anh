I became a singer-songwriter, I guess it was in high school.

00:14.123 --> 00:17.181
I had a great music teacher in high school, and she kind of encouraged me...

00:17.268 --> 00:21.541
...to start taking guitar lessons and piano lessons and start to write songs.

00:22.481 --> 00:27.827
We kind of like the spontaneity of life that being in a band, you get to be in.

00:31.357 --> 00:33.218
Everything about Nashville, I love.

00:33.704 --> 00:36.076
There's something about Nashville that just, I don't know,...

00:36.135 --> 00:37.325
...it just feels good to people.

00:37.793 --> 00:39.831
It just inspires more creativity.

00:45.669 --> 00:48.446
I could just not handle a nine-to-five desk job.

00:48.603 --> 00:50.461
Every day for me is totally different.

00:50.687 --> 00:51.743
It's kind of a daily adventure.

00:51.845 --> 00:53.697
You never know what your schedule looks like.

00:53.912 --> 00:55.828
Our day just changes each day.

01:02.231 --> 01:02.537
Yeah!
