00:00.563 --> 00:04.341
ï»¿Sarah and I actually met in high school.

00:04.753 --> 00:06.993
We've been together for about 12 years.

00:07.769 --> 00:12.286
We sat next to each other in freshman year of high school, math class but...

00:13.411 --> 00:16.461
...this is when Stefaan was, like, probably my height at the time.

00:16.539 --> 00:17.943
We don't have to go into those details.

00:18.181 --> 00:23.704
We just made this decision that we were gonna take a year off and travel...

00:23.767 --> 00:26.707
...and we started saving probably two years before we left.

00:26.909 --> 00:28.326
We have these drawers underneath.

00:29.987 --> 00:34.447
It's even a platform; pop this open, we grill dinner.

00:35.135 --> 00:36.423
We got electricity,...

00:36.595 --> 00:37.651
...we have running water...

00:37.814 --> 00:39.504
...with a 20-gallon tank up in the front.

00:42.736 --> 00:44.221
And then we got all our tools.

00:46.435 --> 00:48.096
We're kind of living like nomads right now.

00:49.465 --> 00:52.615
We didn't wanna plan it too much in a way that was really,...

00:53.247 --> 00:54.338
...we just wanted to keep it open...

00:54.465 --> 00:58.742
...so that we had the freedom to do what we wanted and just explore...

00:58.992 --> 01:01.119
...and be able to get up and leave at a moment's notice,...

01:01.257 --> 01:03.553
...which is really what the adventure was all about.
