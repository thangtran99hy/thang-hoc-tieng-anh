ï»¿My name is Joshua Jean Baptiste.

00:04.000 --> 00:04.780
I'm 24 years old.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.089
I'm a born and raised Miami resident.

00:07.283 --> 00:08.681
I'm Haitian-American.

00:09.252 --> 00:13.814
I'm an actor, rapper, recent writer, overall artist.

00:14.270 --> 00:14.583
I love Miami.

00:15.004 --> 00:17.038
I don't plan on going anywhere for quite some time.

00:17.660 --> 00:20.199
I think it's a bubbling pot of potential.

00:21.321 --> 00:29.177
So I have to say that my biggest goal is to be successful with positivity and not negativity.

00:29.901 --> 00:30.884
It's cheesy as it sounds.

00:32.215 --> 00:34.379
I always had an interest in rap when I was younger.

00:35.044 --> 00:40.525
I did poetry as well, so words were always something that I was rather expressive with.

00:40.878 --> 00:43.019
...and "8 Mile" kinda sealed the deal for me.

00:44.234 --> 00:47.177
I was actually like one of the best rappers in my school.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.012
I'd walk down the halls and be high-fived.

00:50.650 --> 00:52.708
I'm trying to grow my own signature style.

00:53.450 --> 00:56.619
The educated hip-hop star now is kind of coming into the limelight.

00:57.087 --> 00:59.526
I like the juxtaposition of professionalism and hood.

01:00.421 --> 01:03.642
I do wear gold chains 'cause I do think it's awesome.

01:04.300 --> 01:06.043
However, I will wear a gold chain with a cardigan.
