Hey, I'm Sara from Los Angeles.

00:05.785 --> 00:06.578
I love kittens.

00:06.957 --> 00:10.965
It's my biggest aspiration to have a kiddie pool full of kittens.

00:11.765 --> 00:13.721
I recently moved here from Austin, Texas.

00:14.113 --> 00:16.306
I was born and raised there so it's time to get out.

00:17.188 --> 00:18.447
I've always done hair.

00:18.592 --> 00:19.935
I cut people's hair in high school...

00:20.014 --> 00:23.246
...and then right out of high school I went to beauty school.

00:24.127 --> 00:24.563
It was great.

00:24.928 --> 00:27.929
I kept getting kicked out of beauty school for various reasons.

00:28.353 --> 00:31.983
One of them would be because I started working for a corporation...

00:32.843 --> 00:33.979
...when I was still in school.

00:34.730 --> 00:38.614
They didn't really care too much for not being able to say that they taught me my craft.

00:39.813 --> 00:40.650
And when I graduated,...

00:40.725 --> 00:44.581
...I was one of the few that I've ever known that graduated with a full portfolio.

00:45.748 --> 00:46.942
I'm trying to get back in the swing of it,...

00:47.025 --> 00:52.389
...but I've been really busy with modeling and running a lot to castings and stuff like that.

00:53.279 --> 00:56.318
I love change 'cause if I sit still too long I start to go crazy.
