Well, I'm a 22-year-old performance artist based in Austin, Texas.

00:06.775 --> 00:13.759
The kind of people that I gravitate towards tend to have lived like a multitude of lives.

00:13.872 --> 00:21.698
I've been all over the place in the world or internally in their life.

00:22.586 --> 00:25.324
But yeah, interesting people with stories.

00:28.135 --> 00:33.745
Oh, I am in a wholehearted, committed relationship to my art.

00:33.904 --> 00:40.883
I like to explore identity and culture and history and legacy.

00:41.288 --> 00:49.174
All these things that I am, and will be and have been, they come out.

00:51.304 --> 00:54.621
And a lot of the time, I guess some people would call that drag,...

00:54.734 --> 00:55.927
...but I don't call it drag,...

00:56.011 --> 00:57.131
...I call it performance art.
