I'm born and raised in LA.

00:03.866 --> 00:05.051
I'm 19.

00:05.815 --> 00:07.699
I'm working, I'm not going to college.

00:08.429 --> 00:11.821
It's a big choice to make, but I'm satisfied with it.

00:12.463 --> 00:17.131
I'm working for a fashion company and I'm doing celebrity PR for them.

00:17.311 --> 00:18.711
It has its ups and downs.

00:19.239 --> 00:21.557
It's definitely a challenging job.

00:22.888 --> 00:25.939
We do our best to dress everyone.

00:26.309 --> 00:31.723
And we're constantly filtering through requests that we get from different stylists...

00:31.821 --> 00:38.797
...for premieres or for award shows or photocalls, things like that.

00:38.936 --> 00:41.639
It's a lot of emailing, but it's fun.

00:42.497 --> 00:45.352
I think that fashion is a really cool thing...

00:45.445 --> 00:50.288
...because it's constantly changing and it doesn't really ever take a break.

00:50.685 --> 00:53.679
Once you've seen one season or one collection,...

00:53.922 --> 00:55.725
...within a couple of months there's a new one.

00:55.959 --> 00:58.364
So, it's fun to just always have something new.
