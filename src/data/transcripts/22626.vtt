Hey, I'm Sami Kriegstein.

00:03.593 --> 00:06.899
I live in Venice, California and I'm 27.

00:07.077 --> 00:08.762
And I'm very busy.

00:09.184 --> 00:10.442
I'm a producer.

00:10.519 --> 00:13.456
I'm producing a feature-length documentary film.

00:13.751 --> 00:16.205
I am a voice-over artist.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.336
I run a film festival for music videos.

00:19.744 --> 00:24.416
And I consult for YouTube and Web companies.

00:25.718 --> 00:30.169
Probably the one thing that is consistent across everything that I do is my cell phone.

00:30.332 --> 00:32.104
I have to have it with me at all times.

00:32.224 --> 00:33.334
It's a part of my body.

00:33.555 --> 00:35.666
I guess in that sense, it's kind of like a child...

00:35.769 --> 00:39.291
...like, I have to know where it is and I need to make sure it's charged,...

00:39.389 --> 00:43.137
...like, I wanted to make sure I fed it or something.

00:43.230 --> 00:45.105
It's like my little baby.

00:45.710 --> 00:49.700
I love going on Instagram and just hitting the "Explore" button,...

00:49.855 --> 00:51.137
...especially really late at night.

00:51.453 --> 00:53.727
Seeing photos from different countries...

00:53.827 --> 00:57.559
...and you know, people from worlds that I have no concept of...

00:58.003 --> 01:00.058
...and kind of getting to dive deep into those,...

01:00.251 --> 01:05.093
...that kind of inspires me and helps me stay creative I think.
