00:00.262 --> 00:02.671
As a young boy, Bruce witnessed his parents' murder...

00:02.795 --> 00:04.839
...at the hands of an unidentified mugger.

00:05.056 --> 00:07.306
Bruce's life was dramatically changed from then on...

00:07.544 --> 00:09.361
...as he vowed to avenge his parents' death.

00:09.934 --> 00:12.947
Longtime butler of the Wayne family Alfred Pennyworth...

00:13.153 --> 00:16.415
...arranged so that Bruce would not be taken into social service care.

00:16.743 --> 00:20.063
As a teenager, Bruce Wayne departs on a journey around the world...

00:20.240 --> 00:23.599
...to learn all the skills needed to become the crusader he envisioned.

00:23.795 --> 00:27.892
Bruce Wayne then returned to Gotham City, a city rampant with crime and corruption.

00:28.062 --> 00:32.540
A bat flying through his window gave him the inspiration to transform himself into Batman.

00:32.859 --> 00:34.386
Batman has no superpowers.

00:34.517 --> 00:37.799
Instead, he uses his fighting skills, scientific knowledge...

00:37.928 --> 00:40.545
...and exceptional detective abilities to fight crime.

00:41.072 --> 00:45.303
Perhaps the most famous bat-inspired object used by Batman is his Batmobile.

00:45.586 --> 00:49.959
During the day, Bruce Wayne plays up a lifestyle of a superficial wealthy playboy...

00:50.127 --> 00:52.597
...in order to hide his crime-fighting alter ego.
