ï»¿This is Grayson.

00:02.073 --> 00:03.721
This is my third-grade friend.

00:04.112 --> 00:06.039
We've gone through the major life moments together:...

00:06.138 --> 00:09.053
...traveling to the Europe, going through puberty.

00:09.442 --> 00:11.087
We went to boarding school so it got really weird.

00:11.203 --> 00:14.962
People do bizarre things like run through the dining hall completely naked during dinner.

00:15.485 --> 00:18.047
We were hanging out and both of our girlfriends were out of town...

00:18.123 --> 00:23.401
...and it was a Saturday night, so we're like, "We're men, let's do things, let's be crazy."

00:23.899 --> 00:26.675
And so the extent of our craziness was eating banana bread...

00:26.793 --> 00:29.136
...and that was where our craziness ended.

00:29.269 --> 00:33.349
It was banana bread and taking photos of ourselves in bathrobes to send to our girlfriends...

00:33.405 --> 00:36.141
...saying we miss them because we're pathetic.

00:36.992 --> 00:40.377
We're really fortunate they're not jealous people because I think at times,...

00:40.443 --> 00:43.584
...Grayson and I are better boyfriends to each other than we are to them.

00:45.264 --> 00:46.919
What are we gonna do today, Grayson?

00:47.537 --> 00:48.398
It is your birthday.

00:49.012 --> 00:52.977
We already had a Belgian waffle with strawberries and whipped cream this morning.

00:53.995 --> 00:54.625
It was lovely.

00:54.693 --> 00:55.872
We're gonna be fat kids together.

00:55.963 --> 00:57.685
And that's really what any relationship is based off,...

00:57.759 --> 01:01.729
...of this how fat you can be in front of the other person without feeling bad about yourself.

01:02.269 --> 01:04.221
It works out really well too 'cause we have the same sunglasses...

01:04.282 --> 01:06.858
...so anytime I lose mine I can steal his and it's wonderful.

01:06.916 --> 01:09.333
So every day it's my birthday even though today is his.
