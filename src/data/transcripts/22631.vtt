ï»¿Keezy started as an experiment.

00:03.597 --> 00:06.183
We wasted many, many hours just playing with it.

00:06.291 --> 00:09.119
I would say more hours playing with it than making it.

00:09.451 --> 00:13.848
We like saying it's for kids of all ages and we mean like, 30-year-old kids, too.

00:15.573 --> 00:17.753
We created a music toy called Keezy.

00:18.023 --> 00:20.635
It's an app that has eight colored tiles.

00:20.941 --> 00:24.635
You can record any sound you want into it and play those sounds back.

00:25.661 --> 00:29.207
You really just have an instrument in your hand, which is so cool.

00:29.332 --> 00:30.038
We made an instrument.

00:31.107 --> 00:34.195
Yeah, it's really fun showing off Keezy at parties.

00:34.555 --> 00:37.513
Seeing people who are normally awkward around music play with it...

00:37.688 --> 00:39.521
...and really feel like they're making music.

00:40.621 --> 00:44.558
My partners and I got to do so much to not only just building the interface...

00:44.751 --> 00:48.791
...but working on all the marketing stuff, directing the live-action commercials,...

00:48.881 --> 00:51.434
...so working with Reggie Watts was really awesome.

00:52.779 --> 00:55.161
So Death by South West was around the corner.

00:55.525 --> 01:00.852
We really wanted to build a giant Keezy with freakin' huge tiles.

01:01.263 --> 01:03.683
Yeah, to see a really fun, popular thing that,...

01:03.984 --> 01:07.315
...like, some of our favorite musicians are using and having a lot of fun with...

01:07.491 --> 01:12.048
...to then becoming this giant centerpiece in an installation...

01:12.112 --> 01:17.640
...is such a crazy thing to see happen to something as humble as a phone app...

01:17.758 --> 01:19.015
...with eight squares on it.
