ï»¿My name is Bryan.

00:05.359 --> 00:06.405
I'm 20 years old.

00:06.733 --> 00:08.096
I live in Los Angeles.

00:08.826 --> 00:09.539
I'm a musician.

00:09.609 --> 00:11.653
I play in bands around L.A.

00:12.661 --> 00:14.594
We had a pretty good year.

00:14.737 --> 00:18.177
Last year, we did a full US with Paramore.

00:19.337 --> 00:24.930
We do this thing where we'll all split up and explore whatever city we're in.

00:25.327 --> 00:27.118
While we're there, we'll take pictures of like,...

00:27.547 --> 00:32.032
...if there's a little miniature gnome or just some weird statue.

00:32.915 --> 00:35.975
We'll literally just take a picture of that and send it in a group text...

00:36.251 --> 00:39.834
...so everyone else in the band would be like, "Oh look, it's Bryan!"...

00:39.903 --> 00:41.063
...or "Oh look, it's Lucas!"

00:41.811 --> 00:43.590
It's just like, we mess with each other that way,...

00:43.669 --> 00:44.635
..."Oh look, I found you!"...

00:44.720 --> 00:49.333
...and "It's a statue of some naked little angel baby or something."

00:51.113 --> 00:52.873
Yeah, at least.

00:53.578 --> 00:55.449
There's time for fun with the ladies.

00:56.091 --> 00:56.411
Yeah.
