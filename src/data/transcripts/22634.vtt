When I was in high school, this interesting thing happened where I made a decision...

00:11.810 --> 00:15.975
...that I was forever gonna do exactly what it is that I want with my life...

00:16.078 --> 00:21.945
...which is creativity, painting, drawing, sculpting, building, making.

00:22.136 --> 00:23.961
I don't consider myself a street artist.

00:24.042 --> 00:28.458
I consider myself a fine artist that likes to dabble in the street.

00:29.169 --> 00:32.874
I mean, ever since I was a little kid, I was in love with Buzz Lightyear.

00:33.149 --> 00:38.703
And then when I grew up, I kind of just made him a metaphor to me.

00:39.359 --> 00:44.059
You have the hand of God embracing what Buzz means to me.

00:44.635 --> 00:47.807
So in my eyes, it just kind of a symbol for doing things...

00:47.903 --> 00:50.611
...that others think aren't possible at the time.

00:51.725 --> 00:54.351
Yeah, I'm just kind of treating life as a playground...

00:54.449 --> 00:58.950
...and waking up and doing everything that I want to do every day.
