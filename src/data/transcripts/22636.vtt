00:04.682 --> 00:06.490
This is a voiced consonant.

00:06.860 --> 00:09.483
You can hear it at the beginning of the word joke,...

00:10.087 --> 00:12.029
...in the middle of the word lodger,...

00:12.605 --> 00:14.660
...at the end of the word bridge,...

00:15.103 --> 00:18.126
...and at the beginning and end of the word judge.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.123
Did you notice the shape of my mouth?

00:23.191 --> 00:23.937
Judge.

00:25.473 --> 00:26.219
Judge.

00:27.508 --> 00:28.420
Now let's practice.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.198
Listen and repeat after me.

00:31.161 --> 00:31.708
Joke.

00:33.529 --> 00:34.232
Lodger.

00:36.216 --> 00:36.963
Bridge.

00:38.561 --> 00:39.279
Judge.

00:40.933 --> 00:41.417
Okay.

00:47.513 --> 00:51.787
You may find it difficult to hear the difference between the voiced sound...

00:52.065 --> 00:54.633
...that you hear at the beginning of the word joke,...

00:55.372 --> 00:59.702
...and its voiceless partner that you hear at the beginning of the word choke.

01:00.542 --> 01:02.427
Listen carefully to hear the difference.

01:03.006 --> 01:07.482
For each example, I'll say the word with the voiced sound first.

01:09.121 --> 01:09.625
Joke.

01:10.476 --> 01:11.166
Choke.

01:11.907 --> 01:12.418
Junk.

01:13.284 --> 01:13.974
Chunk.

01:14.556 --> 01:15.473
Lunge.

01:16.099 --> 01:16.731
Lunch.

01:17.575 --> 01:18.443
Surge.

01:19.240 --> 01:19.987
Search.

01:21.216 --> 01:21.984
Now you try.

01:22.295 --> 01:23.611
Listen and repeat.

01:24.187 --> 01:24.684
Joke.

01:26.615 --> 01:27.261
Choke.

01:29.316 --> 01:29.988
Junk.

01:31.858 --> 01:32.547
Chunk.

01:34.165 --> 01:35.065
Lunge.

01:36.631 --> 01:37.293
Lunch.

01:39.149 --> 01:40.009
Surge.

01:41.752 --> 01:42.489
Search.

01:44.236 --> 01:44.812
Okay.
