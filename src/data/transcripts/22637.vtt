ï»¿I'm a freelance stylist.

00:05.096 --> 00:08.096
I became a stylist because I was a terrible model.

00:09.079 --> 00:11.664
As soon as the camera comes up, I get really nervous...

00:11.796 --> 00:16.137
...and I would overthink the situation, and it's just kind of not really for me.

00:16.292 --> 00:17.837
I'm better at dressing the girls.

00:19.716 --> 00:21.148
I love not having a boss.

00:21.516 --> 00:24.203
You get to take your own vacation, you live your life.

00:24.336 --> 00:26.385
You can run off if you want to.

00:28.378 --> 00:31.306
Recently, I just went off to London, my first time in Europe,...

00:31.781 --> 00:33.515
...and that was an amazing experience.

00:34.004 --> 00:36.846
It's really empowering to be like your own person...

00:36.911 --> 00:40.179
...and make your own decisions, and you're kind of in charge of your own destiny.
