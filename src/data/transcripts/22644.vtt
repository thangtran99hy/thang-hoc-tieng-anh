I think of it as a mutual kind of idea that we all came up with and all love.

00:13.187 --> 00:18.131
We're all kind of nerds, and people just made us giggle, so we went for it.

00:18.601 --> 00:24.744
"Splat" is a game that allows up to 115 players to play at the same time on the same screen.

00:25.173 --> 00:28.952
We basically wanted to make a game, something that was really interactive...

00:29.195 --> 00:31.054
...that uses mobile devices to connect to it...

00:31.271 --> 00:34.406
...that also worked with a large group or a large crowd.

00:34.675 --> 00:38.511
Basically, when you walk up to the game, you log in using a mobile URL.

00:38.842 --> 00:42.251
There's a button on your phone that says, "Poop", and all you do is just poop away.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.878
Poop on all the targets below.

00:44.496 --> 00:45.375
Poop on all the cars.

00:45.459 --> 00:48.390
Poop on all, everything that goes by, to get points.

00:50.051 --> 00:55.258
Eventually, we want to be able to do this in sporting arenas and huge conferences...

00:55.366 --> 00:59.015
...and have tens of thousands of people potentially pooping in cars at the same time.

00:59.337 --> 01:02.986
So far, we've only been able to show "Splat" just once to an audience.

01:03.102 --> 01:06.499
So, we're extremely excited to be down at South By...

01:06.843 --> 01:09.730
...and get a bunch of people playing the game...

01:09.811 --> 01:11.746
...and giving us feedback and just having fun with it.

01:12.577 --> 01:13.826
It's a dream, a dream come true.
