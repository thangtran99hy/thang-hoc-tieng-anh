I'm 25 years old,...

00:03.780 --> 00:08.182
...I live in Los Angeles, and I design socks for a living.

00:09.135 --> 00:12.054
They're cut and sew, which is different than most socks.

00:12.363 --> 00:17.077
It creates these like really beautiful seams on the back of the foot and around the foot.

00:17.332 --> 00:20.941
I'm happy that I get to do what I want to do,...

00:21.059 --> 00:25.405
...and stressed out whether or not it's actually gonna work out.

00:26.713 --> 00:31.123
When I was at a bar with my friends dancing and I was really drunk,...

00:31.607 --> 00:34.415
...and I dropped my phone into the toilet.

00:34.558 --> 00:39.184
And when I fished it out, I rinsed it off with water...

00:39.397 --> 00:44.158
...and I put it in a bag of rice to try to save it.

00:44.585 --> 00:47.851
And it totally worked, but the only thing that was wrong with the phone...

00:48.010 --> 00:51.363
...is it would repeatedly text people the letter P.

00:52.035 --> 00:55.414
And so I thought it was kind of ironic that I like dropped it in pee.

00:55.983 --> 00:57.351
It was texting people P.

00:57.523 --> 00:58.011
You know what I mean?
