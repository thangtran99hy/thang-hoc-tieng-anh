It is wonderful to be back in Japan.

00:07.890 --> 00:09.575
This is my third visit as president.

00:10.297 --> 00:15.813
I'm deeply honored to be making the first state visit by a US President in nearly two decades.

00:16.795 --> 00:20.841
I'm grateful to Their Majesties, the emperor and empress,...

00:21.100 --> 00:23.265
...for their gracious welcome this morning.

00:24.278 --> 00:28.466
And I've once again been touched by the kindness and hospitality of the Japanese people.

00:29.158 --> 00:33.858
I'm pleased that we continue to deepen the extraordinary ties between our people,...

00:34.501 --> 00:39.241
...especially our young people, like the Japanese students that I'll be meeting later today.
