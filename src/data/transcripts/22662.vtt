WEBVTT

00:00.540 --> 00:02.363
It's not just a job.

00:02.453 --> 00:04.597
It's sort of, probably the most important job.

00:05.705 --> 00:09.528
The title that we have going right now is Director of Operations,...

00:09.729 --> 00:11.799
...but it's really kinda so much more than that.

00:12.050 --> 00:15.450
Responsibilities and requirements are really quite extensive.

00:15.857 --> 00:19.327
First category for the requirements would be mobility.

00:19.529 --> 00:21.651
This job requires that you must be able to work,...

00:21.771 --> 00:24.676
...standing up most or really all of the time,...

00:25.109 --> 00:27.705
...constantly on your feet, constantly bending over,...

00:28.073 --> 00:30.824
...constantly exerting yourself, a high level of stamina.

00:34.113 --> 00:34.478
Okay.

00:35.113 --> 00:35.606
That's a lot.

00:37.761 --> 00:38.669
For how many hours?

00:39.030 --> 00:41.896
135 hours to unlimited hours a week.

00:41.979 --> 00:44.477
It's basically 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

00:44.761 --> 00:46.393
I'm sure you'll have a chance from time to time...

00:46.481 --> 00:47.961
...to maybe just sit down here and there, yeah?

00:48.881 --> 00:49.456
You mean, like a break?

00:50.327 --> 00:51.609
No, there are no breaks available.

00:53.798 --> 00:55.094
Is that even legal?

00:55.165 --> 00:55.960
Yeah, of course, yeah.

00:56.197 --> 00:56.539
Okay.

00:56.787 --> 00:57.894
So like, no lunch?

00:57.951 --> 01:01.282
You can have lunch, but only when the associate is done eating their lunch.

01:04.033 --> 01:05.699
I think that's a little intense.

01:06.725 --> 01:08.106
Also, let's cover the salary.

01:08.389 --> 01:10.555
The position is gonna pay absolutely nothing.

01:11.909 --> 01:12.411
Excuse me?

01:13.298 --> 01:13.969
No!

01:15.185 --> 01:16.207
Nobody's doing that for free!

01:16.277 --> 01:16.962
Yeah, pro bono.

01:17.091 --> 01:17.983
Completely for free.

01:18.181 --> 01:18.763
No!

01:18.858 --> 01:20.391
What if I told you there's someone that actually...

01:20.587 --> 01:23.695
...currently holds this position right now?

01:24.645 --> 01:25.711
Billions of people actually.

01:25.859 --> 01:26.275
Who?

01:26.874 --> 01:27.461
Moms.

01:30.254 --> 01:30.774
That's awesome.
