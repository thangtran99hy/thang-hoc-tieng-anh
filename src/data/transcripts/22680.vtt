00:00.040 --> 00:03.635
My mum is the best at catching the bus...

00:03.781 --> 00:05.057
...'cause she's the best runner.

00:05.298 --> 00:11.240
My mum's favorite thing to do is listen to the TV while she's sleeping.

00:11.474 --> 00:16.953
The funniest thing my mum has ever said was that my brother has bushy eyebrows.

00:17.091 --> 00:18.257
She can't dance.

00:20.853 --> 00:26.653
If I had 100 pounds, I'll give her a trip to Disneyland.

00:26.858 --> 00:28.512
She really wants to go there.

00:28.760 --> 00:33.505
I'll buy my mum a real dinosaur so she can ride in there...

00:33.597 --> 00:35.417
...and doesn't have to catch a bus.

00:35.570 --> 00:39.487
On Mother's Day morning, I'm gonna make breakfast for my mum.

00:39.642 --> 00:43.717
I'm gonna see if there's a chili competition because she loves chili.

00:44.293 --> 00:47.001
Without her knowing, I'm gonna sign her in.

00:47.295 --> 00:48.789
Mum, Happy Mother's Day!

00:49.449 --> 00:50.609
Guess what I got you.

00:50.833 --> 00:52.427
A chili contest!

00:52.704 --> 00:54.497
You're doing a great job, mum.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.193
You're doing a great job, mum.

00:56.327 --> 00:57.958
You're doing a great job, mum.

00:58.135 --> 01:00.021
You're doing a great job, mum.
