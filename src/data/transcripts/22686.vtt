They're not fooling anybody that what happened was a natural disaster.

00:10.941 --> 00:12.415
It was not an earthquake.

00:14.067 --> 00:15.470
It wasn't a typhoon.

00:16.895 --> 00:17.840
They're lying!

00:20.141 --> 00:21.137
I'm not crazy.

00:22.142 --> 00:24.026
Whatever it is they're guarding so carefully,...

00:24.465 --> 00:28.457
...I need to be able to prove that it's real.

00:36.081 --> 00:39.589
The arrogance of man is thinking nature is in their control,...

00:41.747 --> 00:43.243
...and not the other way around.

00:45.265 --> 00:47.644
I know many of you have family and loved ones,...

00:50.187 --> 00:51.409
...and that you want to help them.

00:52.471 --> 00:53.786
Now, this is your chance.
