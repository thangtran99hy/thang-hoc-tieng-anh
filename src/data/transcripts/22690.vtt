00:00.453 --> 00:02.013
You are the world champion.

00:02.223 --> 00:02.828
What a comeback.

00:03.494 --> 00:05.095
What a resolve in every throw.

00:05.199 --> 00:06.141
How do you feel at the moment?

00:08.431 --> 00:11.189
First of all, of course I'm happy to be a champion...

00:11.212 --> 00:15.526
And also, I'm happy to be standing here, compete with my rivals...

00:15.658 --> 00:18.813
...here in the World Championship stage and I'm so happy about it.

00:19.442 --> 00:21.692
When did you know that you are in this good shape,...

00:21.735 --> 00:24.353
...that you can be so consistent in this competition...

00:24.399 --> 00:26.441
...and throw that kind of, what you did today?
