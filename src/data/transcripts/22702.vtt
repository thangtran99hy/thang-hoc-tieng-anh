00:02.963 --> 00:04.775
I am not a data point...

00:05.189 --> 00:06.779
...to be bought and sold.

00:07.595 --> 00:09.240
I am not a threat.

00:09.823 --> 00:12.592
Why are my baby pictures under surveillance?

00:13.317 --> 00:15.579
My identity is mine.

00:16.055 --> 00:17.061
You don't own it.

00:17.483 --> 00:18.375
I'm a citizen...

00:18.705 --> 00:19.792
...who lives in the world...

00:20.151 --> 00:21.269
...and on the Web.

00:21.839 --> 00:23.063
I need rights,...

00:23.353 --> 00:24.758
...rights I could understand.

00:25.521 --> 00:27.756
I need technology I can trust...

00:28.088 --> 00:29.809
...from people who respect me.

00:31.388 --> 00:33.809
I'm grateful for what you've given the world.

00:34.128 --> 00:36.601
I'm scared how powerful you've become.

00:37.363 --> 00:39.022
Remember to put me first.

00:39.287 --> 00:40.716
Balance commercial profit...

00:40.905 --> 00:42.282
...and public benefit.

00:42.546 --> 00:44.921
Keep the Web free and open.

00:45.511 --> 00:47.067
Give me the tools I need...

00:47.414 --> 00:49.178
...to build a future I dream.

00:50.294 --> 00:53.229
The Internet is our largest shared resource.

00:53.528 --> 00:54.678
Let's take care of it.

00:55.103 --> 00:57.021
There's never been a better time.
