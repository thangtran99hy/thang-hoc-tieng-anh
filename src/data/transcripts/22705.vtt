00:00.713 --> 00:01.780
You're from Brazil, huh?

00:01.901 --> 00:02.077
Yeah.

00:02.309 --> 00:03.855
Don't worry man, this is your year.

00:03.930 --> 00:05.141
You're gonna win the whole thing.

00:05.211 --> 00:07.203
You just have to avoid Spain.

00:08.372 --> 00:10.021
Yeah, but they don't have Ronaldo.

00:10.332 --> 00:11.394
I love Ronaldo.

00:11.489 --> 00:12.855
I don't care about Ronaldo.

00:13.146 --> 00:14.532
We got a stronger defense.

00:14.665 --> 00:15.934
He's not gonna score on Tim Howard.

00:16.014 --> 00:17.232
Nobody can stop Messi.

00:17.330 --> 00:18.239
Nobody can beat...

00:18.325 --> 00:18.647
...Italy.

00:18.761 --> 00:19.256
Argentina.

00:19.354 --> 00:19.758
France.

00:19.937 --> 00:20.214
Belgium.

00:20.319 --> 00:21.791
Germany has got a strong team.

00:21.879 --> 00:23.251
He blew a great qualifier.

00:23.588 --> 00:26.382
But if it goes to penalties, we are doomed.
