Hello, I'm Sara Zaman with VOA 60 America for May 15th.

00:07.654 --> 00:09.969
President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama...

00:10.051 --> 00:12.280
...joined family members, survivors and rescuers...

00:12.377 --> 00:15.709
...for the dedication of the National September 11 Memorial Museum...

00:15.909 --> 00:17.611
...ahead of next week's public opening.

00:17.887 --> 00:19.715
The museum has been years in the making.

00:19.948 --> 00:22.309
It contains parts of the World Trade Center towers...

00:22.537 --> 00:26.669
...and nearly 2,000 oral histories and personal items that belong to the victims.

00:27.647 --> 00:29.999
Wildfires continue to rage in Southern California...

00:30.085 --> 00:33.107
...after thousands of people were forced to evacuate their homes.

00:33.343 --> 00:35.846
Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency...

00:35.932 --> 00:38.443
...to bring more resources in to fight the fires.

00:38.895 --> 00:41.418
And finally, at least fifty thousand gallons of oil...

00:41.496 --> 00:43.633
...have spilled onto the streets of Los Angeles.

00:43.843 --> 00:48.061
A 20-inch pipe developed a leak, spewing oil that is knee-deep in some areas.

00:48.568 --> 00:52.237
Workers are trying to contain the spill before it seeps into sewers and storm drains...

00:52.340 --> 00:53.633
...and pollutes groundwater.

00:54.463 --> 00:56.205
That's all for today, thanks for watching.
