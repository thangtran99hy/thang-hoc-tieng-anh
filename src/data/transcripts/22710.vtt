ï»¿What's your name?

00:01.348 --> 00:01.711
Hazel.

00:02.089 --> 00:02.748
What's your full name?

00:03.177 --> 00:04.419
Hazel Grace Lancaster.

00:05.124 --> 00:06.239
Why are you staring at me?

00:07.009 --> 00:07.611
'Cause you're beautiful.

00:09.933 --> 00:10.961
So, what's your story?

00:11.499 --> 00:12.922
I was diagnosed when I was 13.

00:13.585 --> 00:14.334
Your real story.

00:15.311 --> 00:17.583
I am quite unextraordinary.

00:17.909 --> 00:19.279
I reject that on the hand.

00:20.810 --> 00:22.347
You know, Gus talks about you all the time.

00:23.089 --> 00:23.964
We're just friends.

00:24.507 --> 00:26.668
I hope you realize, you trying to keep your distance from me...

00:26.741 --> 00:28.459
...in no way lessens my affection for you.

00:28.697 --> 00:29.441
Gus, I'm a grenade.

00:31.311 --> 00:32.257
One day, I'm gonna blow up,...

00:33.918 --> 00:35.703
...and I'm gonna obliterate everything in my wake,...

00:36.759 --> 00:38.402
...and I don't want to hurt you.

00:41.055 --> 00:42.797
You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world,...

00:43.008 --> 00:44.793
...but you do have a say in who hurts you.

00:45.117 --> 00:46.747
I am in love with you, Hazel Grace.

00:47.180 --> 00:50.779
And I know that love is just to shout into the void and that oblivion is inevitable,...

00:51.299 --> 00:52.588
...and I am in love with you.

00:53.449 --> 00:55.225
All your efforts to keep me from you are gonna fail.

00:59.721 --> 01:02.081
You gave me a forever within the numbered days,...

01:02.289 --> 01:05.961
...and I can't tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity.

01:06.611 --> 01:07.942
It's a good life, Hazel Grace.

01:08.520 --> 01:08.935
Okay?

01:11.107 --> 01:11.525
Okay.
