According to research from Internet monitoring company DeepField,...

00:05.506 --> 00:09.292
...Google makes up for 25 percent of consumer Internet traffic in North America.

00:10.089 --> 00:13.544
It's more traffic than Facebook, Netflix and Instagram added together.

00:14.238 --> 00:18.671
DeepField's research found that over 62 percent of devices connected to the Internet in North America...

00:18.917 --> 00:21.083
...use Google servers at least once a day.

00:21.776 --> 00:25.706
In 2010, Google reportedly accounted for six percent of Internet traffic,...

00:25.917 --> 00:28.405
...so they have shown significant growth over that short time.

00:29.216 --> 00:33.728
To facilitate their growth, Google has the second highest bandwidth capabilities after Netflix,...

00:33.971 --> 00:36.409
...and they have increased the number of servers that they are operating.

00:37.048 --> 00:40.859
Eighty percent of Internet Service Providers in North America have Google Global Cache...

00:41.241 --> 00:45.834
...or GGC servers attached to them, processing information being used on the Internet.

00:46.593 --> 00:48.400
DeepField co-founder Craig Labovitz said,...

00:48.620 --> 00:50.924
"...The odds are, if you have an Internet-connected device,..."

00:51.159 --> 00:54.236
"...at the end of the day it will be exchanging information with a Google server."

00:54.987 --> 00:57.853
The GGC servers speed up the data recovery process...

00:58.006 --> 01:00.315
...so that popular websites and videos can be accessed...

01:00.517 --> 01:04.085
...without having to go all the way from Google's data center to stream the content.
