ï»¿I took my retirement savings and I risked it all and it worked.

00:13.040 --> 00:15.572
When kids were doing other stuff, I was out surfing.

00:15.689 --> 00:20.664
I was like really into video games and, you know, super nerd geek culture stuff.

00:21.668 --> 00:26.067
I think it was my second shoulder surgery, I ended up losing one of my main sponsors.

00:26.389 --> 00:30.148
Even though I had never hosted anything a day before in my life,...

00:30.643 --> 00:33.896
...because of who I was they were able to embrace me.

00:34.012 --> 00:35.855
Whether it's mopping the floors,...

00:35.961 --> 00:39.279
...whether it's painting signs, you really need to get your hands dirty.

00:39.499 --> 00:42.198
I knew I kind of had one chance to give it my all.

00:42.998 --> 00:44.979
It's like I had to make the decision to be who I am.

00:45.247 --> 00:47.367
I went from 101 to number one.

00:47.741 --> 00:49.094
So I'm just gonna keep going.

00:49.202 --> 00:49.941
I never look back.

00:50.064 --> 00:50.831
I never look back.
