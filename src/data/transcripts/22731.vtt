00:00.015 --> 00:01.823
Today is a traditional Chinese holiday.

00:01.925 --> 00:04.129
We celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival by holding...

00:04.241 --> 00:06.071
...yup, you guessed it, dragon boat races.

00:06.166 --> 00:09.704
Oh and of course, we eat Zongzi, kind of like a Chinese version of a Tamale.

00:09.878 --> 00:14.138
The history of Dragon Boat Festival dates back to as early as 484 BCE...

00:14.244 --> 00:15.933
...which is almost like 2,500 years ago.

00:16.029 --> 00:20.782
During that time, the famous Chinese general Wu Zixu was unjustly accused...

00:20.853 --> 00:22.825
...of essentially giving bad advice to the king,...

00:22.904 --> 00:25.880
...who was then forced to commit suicide by the king, not emperor.

00:26.030 --> 00:28.265
His body was thrown into the river near Suzhou...

00:28.384 --> 00:29.948
...which is kind of like the Venice of China.

00:30.081 --> 00:33.873
But a decade later, people realized that Wu was actually right about his advice.

00:34.145 --> 00:35.745
And was wrongly sentenced to death.

00:35.875 --> 00:38.390
The result was that Wu became a celebrated hero...

00:38.489 --> 00:42.805
...and the King, Fuchai actually committed suicide when he realized that he was wrong.

00:42.927 --> 00:44.899
Oh yeah, and his kingdom was taken over.

00:45.211 --> 00:49.251
Anyways, nowadays people generally associate this festival with another famous figure,...

00:49.572 --> 00:51.240
...Qu Yuan, who is a famous poet.

00:51.383 --> 00:53.183
He committed suicide in the Miluo river.

00:53.317 --> 00:56.854
After Qu Yuan's death, local residents wanted to collect the poet's body...

00:57.104 --> 00:59.890
...so they paddled out on boats while beating on drums...

01:00.176 --> 01:02.718
...to scare the fish and evil spirits away, naturally.

01:02.799 --> 01:05.478
They also threw rice snacks wrapped in bamboo leaves into the water...

01:05.557 --> 01:07.727
...to distract the fish from eating his body.

01:07.873 --> 01:11.445
Since then, on the fifth of May of each year on the Chinese Lunar calendar,...

01:11.592 --> 01:14.188
...Chinese people do dragon boat racing and eat Zongzi...

01:14.265 --> 01:16.390
...to commemorate these two historic figures.
