Before we get to EnglishCentral, lots to talk about there,...

00:09.633 --> 00:11.745
...what can you tell us about your life before EnglishCentral?

00:11.858 --> 00:12.413
What were you doing?

00:12.647 --> 00:15.655
From the English language learning perspective, I actually was a teacher in China....

00:16.626 --> 00:17.677
...over 20 years ago.

00:18.153 --> 00:24.233
And I did a two-year stint in both Beijing and in Guangzhou.

00:25.237 --> 00:28.427
And from that point on, I went back to the US...

00:28.511 --> 00:31.319
...and I actually spent over 10 years in the speech recognition industry.

00:32.752 --> 00:38.107
And that was kind of the inspiration for EnglishCentral was to really combine two things:...

00:38.420 --> 00:42.654
...speech recognition technology and authentic media and video.

00:43.119 --> 00:45.337
So, kind of the combination of those two technologies:...

00:45.415 --> 00:50.834
...advancing the proliferation of great Web video content and the advancements of speech recognition.

00:50.944 --> 00:52.767
All right, I wanna get back to speech recognition...

00:52.848 --> 00:54.639
...but go ahead and tell us what is EnglishCentral.

00:55.620 --> 00:59.926
In a phrase, it's YouTube for language learning on speed.

01:01.033 --> 01:08.351
So, again we try to make the initial experience motivating and immersive...

01:08.474 --> 01:12.476
...by presenting the user with a ton of content...

01:12.891 --> 01:15.852
...that they find matches their interests.

01:16.225 --> 01:20.631
The content is leveled based on vocabulary and sentence complexity...

01:20.739 --> 01:23.883
...so they can find video clips that match their level.

01:25.179 --> 01:30.589
And the unique aspect of it from the technology side is this concept of speaking videos.

01:31.033 --> 01:37.335
So, if you're watching an Obama speech or Angelina Jolie on human rights,...

01:38.271 --> 01:44.611
...you can pause, stop the video and mimic their speech at any time during a video,...

01:44.753 --> 01:50.664
...and get feedback and scoring and points based on how well you spoke the line.

01:51.489 --> 01:56.313
It really is a very impressive piece of educational tech.

01:57.365 --> 02:01.764
Students watch a video, sentence by sentence, they can repeat what the speaker said.

02:02.175 --> 02:06.184
They get assessed, they can then listen to their own audio,...

02:06.254 --> 02:07.977
...they can listen to the original audio.

02:09.689 --> 02:12.061
You did a much better job presenting it than I did.

02:13.305 --> 02:16.895
Because it's one, I have to say, as someone in the classroom,...

02:17.379 --> 02:21.095
...it is one of the most usable sites out there where you can say,...

02:21.155 --> 02:22.211
..."Okay students,"...

02:22.507 --> 02:23.499
..."here's EnglishCentral."

02:23.687 --> 02:24.595
"This is how to use it."

02:24.751 --> 02:25.197
"Go."

02:25.892 --> 02:28.022
And they're happy using it the whole period.

02:28.411 --> 02:30.527
Let's say a teacher didn't wanna prepare anything,...

02:30.611 --> 02:32.010
...they could just say, "Go to EnglishCentral."
