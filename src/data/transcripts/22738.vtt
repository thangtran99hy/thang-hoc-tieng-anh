Every kid loves music.

00:02.822 --> 00:07.980
The idea of this is, "Why does it have to be just after school?"

00:08.847 --> 00:10.707
"Why not enjoy it in school?"

00:11.343 --> 00:15.620
A young person can tell you more about who they are through their music...

00:15.881 --> 00:17.563
...than through anything else.

00:18.525 --> 00:22.431
My favorite classes are the ones that help me in my everyday life...

00:22.691 --> 00:25.793
...because they have something to do with your life.

00:26.056 --> 00:34.074
The whole idea is to connect thoughts using the popular music of whatever period of time,...

00:34.759 --> 00:38.813
...to connect to what was happening historically.

00:43.511 --> 00:49.097
The thing that really resonated for me and Steven's original conception was that...

00:49.952 --> 00:52.772
...we wanted to study this musical context.

00:53.131 --> 00:57.350
We wanted to see that this was much more than entertainment.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.395
They're learning from that music.

01:05.775 --> 01:08.763
This curriculum is really an opportunity to take that learning...

01:09.160 --> 01:10.831
...and bring it to a whole other level.

01:11.171 --> 01:13.836
So if you want students to be successful,...

01:14.164 --> 01:18.879
...you as the teacher, as the educator, have to go to where they are at.

01:19.705 --> 01:22.179
And music is such a big part of where they are at.
