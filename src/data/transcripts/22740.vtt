The way I approached interviewing was that I left my ego at the door.

00:05.852 --> 00:08.347
What Larry King thought about something really didn't matter...

00:09.095 --> 00:10.195
...but the guest mattered.

00:10.287 --> 00:12.288
I didn't know more about law than the lawyer,...

00:12.347 --> 00:14.353
...I didn't know more about medicine than the doctor,...

00:14.585 --> 00:15.809
...I didn't know more than my guest...

00:15.892 --> 00:17.225
...and I respected the guest.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.347
I could have disagreed.

00:19.380 --> 00:22.337
But I wanted to be the conduit, from me.

00:23.170 --> 00:26.763
If you're not giving your opinion, the guest is more comfortable...

00:27.005 --> 00:28.110
...'cause you're more interested.

00:28.598 --> 00:30.291
They're not there in a confrontational state...

00:30.767 --> 00:31.804
...and I'm there to learn.

00:34.063 --> 00:36.312
We made the front page of the New York Times,...

00:36.945 --> 00:38.771
...I think more than any other talk show ever...

00:39.492 --> 00:41.281
...because I was getting good quotes.

00:41.860 --> 00:46.348
I also won a Peabody for the radio,...

00:46.429 --> 00:50.811
...the only Peabody ever for a lifetime work on radio talk shows.

00:51.189 --> 00:52.450
Why I never gave an opinion.
