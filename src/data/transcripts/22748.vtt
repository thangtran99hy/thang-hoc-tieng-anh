00:00.113 --> 00:02.643
We need to stay focused on what really matters: baseball.

00:12.827 --> 00:13.877
Listen, grasshoppers.

00:13.968 --> 00:15.085
There's no crying in baseball.

00:16.575 --> 00:18.217
Because if you start, you'll never stop.

00:19.744 --> 00:21.699
You're gonna strike out and you're gonna lose,...

00:22.158 --> 00:23.316
...and you're gonna get cut from the team.

00:23.685 --> 00:25.871
Or even worse, you're gonna make the team but who cares?

00:25.933 --> 00:26.685
It's the lacrosse team.

00:27.956 --> 00:28.494
Don't be ashamed.

00:29.652 --> 00:30.989
Failure happens to the best of us.

00:31.671 --> 00:35.378
But life is about getting up, dusting yourself off, pounding an energy drink,...

00:35.529 --> 00:39.693
...hitting homers, running through walls, making the show, winning the World Series...

00:39.865 --> 00:41.135
...and touring Canada as a DJ.

00:41.755 --> 00:43.892
Because the best bounce back up and do this.

00:47.035 --> 00:49.387
So go ahead and cry, but make sure they're tears of joy.

00:49.768 --> 00:50.705
Because baseball is better.

00:51.797 --> 00:53.967
Baseball is better.
