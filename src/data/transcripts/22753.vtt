ï»¿When I worked in the shipyards and I worked next to a journeyman welder man,...

00:05.117 --> 00:07.404
...we made the same, it was equal pay.

00:12.046 --> 00:13.521
I couldn't be prouder to be here today.

00:14.565 --> 00:16.066
Not only did you help win the war,...

00:16.931 --> 00:20.481
...but you also helped to open up opportunities for women.

00:21.069 --> 00:23.961
Ultimately, equal pay is not just an economic issue...

00:24.101 --> 00:25.498
...for millions of Americans and their families;...

00:26.027 --> 00:29.400
...it's also about whether we're willing to build an economy that works for everybody,...

00:29.643 --> 00:31.879
...whether we're gonna do our part to make sure that our daughters...

00:31.959 --> 00:34.295
...have the same chances to pursue their dreams as our sons.

00:34.827 --> 00:37.151
Part of that is fighting for fair pay for women.

00:38.713 --> 00:42.205
Because when women succeed, America succeeds.

00:43.785 --> 00:45.342
When women succeed, America succeeds.

00:45.441 --> 00:45.811
It's true.

00:46.501 --> 00:51.935
America should be a level playing field, a fair race for everybody,...

00:52.435 --> 00:55.864
...a place where anybody who's willing to work hard has a chance to get ahead.

00:56.280 --> 00:59.529
And restoring that opportunity for every American, men and women,...

00:59.779 --> 01:03.679
...has to be a driving focus for our country.

01:07.600 --> 01:12.777
And it can be the same today if the women just keep at it and stick to it.
