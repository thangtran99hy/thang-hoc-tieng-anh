As long as you're clear about your goals, you're gonna succeed.

00:04.565 --> 00:06.129
We've got a collective responsibility...

00:06.217 --> 00:08.285
...to make sure that you're getting those opportunities.

00:09.050 --> 00:12.504
And there are resources out there that we've got to pull in to the school center.

00:13.729 --> 00:16.115
Businesses, foundations around the country,...

00:16.229 --> 00:20.261
...they wanna fund more career connect programs 'cause it's in their interest.

00:20.721 --> 00:21.232
When you can say,....

00:21.321 --> 00:24.895
..."Hey, the math that I'm doing here could change the way the business operates,"...

00:24.991 --> 00:28.522
...or "I see how this biology experiment could help develop a drug that cures a disease,"...

00:29.355 --> 00:31.271
...that's a door opening in your imagination.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.993
It's also good for our economy, it's good for our businesses.

00:34.559 --> 00:36.388
That's a new career path you're thinking about.

00:36.485 --> 00:39.414
It allows you to pursue higher education in that field...

00:39.966 --> 00:41.799
...or the very training you need to get a good job,...

00:41.940 --> 00:44.099
...or create a new business that changes the world.

00:44.589 --> 00:45.751
That's good for our economy.

00:45.895 --> 00:47.409
It's good for business, it's good for you.

00:48.746 --> 00:49.521
It's good for America.
