00:00.439 --> 00:03.668
To the beholders that I thought mattered, I was still unbeautiful.

00:04.335 --> 00:07.921
And my mother again would say to me, "You can't eat beauty."

00:08.284 --> 00:09.355
"It doesn't feed you."

00:10.320 --> 00:12.105
And these words plagued and bothered me.

00:12.226 --> 00:14.744
I didn't really understand them until finally I realized...

00:14.858 --> 00:19.212
...that beauty was not a thing that I could acquire or consume,...

00:19.783 --> 00:21.875
...it was something that I just had to be.

00:23.087 --> 00:26.744
And what my mother meant when she said, "You can't eat beauty," was that...

00:27.201 --> 00:29.695
...you can't rely on how you look to sustain you.

00:32.501 --> 00:38.488
What actually sustains us, what is fundamentally beautiful is compassion...

00:39.292 --> 00:41.873
...for yourself and for those around you.

00:42.085 --> 00:45.853
That kind of beauty inflames the heart and enchants the soul.

00:46.529 --> 00:50.097
It is what got Patsey in so much trouble with her master...

00:50.533 --> 00:54.054
...but it is also what has kept her story alive to this day.

00:54.833 --> 00:56.864
We remember the beauty of her spirit...

00:57.449 --> 01:00.381
...even after the beauty of her body has faded away.

01:02.955 --> 01:07.430
And so I hope that my presence on your screens...

01:07.851 --> 01:12.401
...and in magazines may lead you, young girl, on a similar journey.

01:13.241 --> 01:16.228
That you will feel the validation of your external beauty...

01:16.633 --> 01:20.902
...but also get to the deeper business of being beautiful inside.

01:21.794 --> 01:27.779
That there is no shade in that beauty.

01:28.215 --> 01:28.661
Thank you.
