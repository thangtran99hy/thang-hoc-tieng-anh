Hi, I'm Jennifer Rizzi and I'm here at the brand-new Nutella Bar in Eataly.

00:06.265 --> 00:09.447
Now, let me tell you this is pretty much a chocolate lover's paradise.

00:09.749 --> 00:14.525
You can get all kinds of Nutella-inspired treats here, from muffins to bread to crepes.

00:14.830 --> 00:18.885
In fact, I'm just about to try one of these delicious-looking Nutella crepes right now.

00:19.618 --> 00:20.578
Hmm, that smells pretty good.

00:20.857 --> 00:22.049
I'll let you know how it goes.

00:22.409 --> 00:26.467
Today, we will open our first Nutella Bar in New York.

00:27.421 --> 00:31.562
We opened our first Nutella Bar in December in Chicago...

00:31.878 --> 00:37.147
...and we decided to open also for the summer our first store here.

00:37.439 --> 00:40.455
It's really important to create a new concept every time.

00:40.867 --> 00:45.971
But most of all, we want to serve to our customer what we love, and we love Nutella.

00:46.194 --> 00:49.690
The taste is so good but is not too sweet,...

00:50.042 --> 00:57.475
...and it's easy to put over everything like cookies, bread, crepes, muffin.

00:57.698 --> 01:00.969
You can spread it over everything.

01:01.278 --> 01:05.377
We are a little bit scared to have a line, a huge line today, outside,...

01:05.511 --> 01:09.933
...but fortunately today is a beautiful day and it's not raining.

01:10.162 --> 01:15.053
This is, I think, the best way to serve and to produce the food in front of the people.

01:15.129 --> 01:16.088
We don't have a secret.

01:16.457 --> 01:19.510
The only secret is Nutella, what they put inside.

01:20.009 --> 01:21.777
All right, time for the moment of truth.

01:22.099 --> 01:23.187
Here's the taste test.

01:26.717 --> 01:28.595
Now, that is a chocolate lover's dream.

01:28.866 --> 01:31.419
Reporting for the New York Daily News, I'm Jennifer Rizzi.
