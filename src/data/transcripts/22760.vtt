I think this is a good time to tell you, "You're doing okay, mom."

00:12.902 --> 00:14.227
I can call you mom, right?

00:15.256 --> 00:19.105
I know we haven't known each other very long, but you seem like a real keeper.

00:20.037 --> 00:21.065
You're not perfect.

00:21.761 --> 00:24.769
There was that strained carrots incident but you're trying.

00:26.351 --> 00:29.327
You pick up my bottle every time I toss it out of my stroller,...

00:30.908 --> 00:32.533
...that's high comedy to an eight-month-old.

00:33.633 --> 00:37.491
You hum the Barber of Seville when you wash my hair, so cool.

00:39.219 --> 00:41.203
And your rubdowns are out of this world.

00:42.632 --> 00:45.879
Anyway, I want you to know how much I appreciate you.

00:47.007 --> 00:47.891
You know, right?

00:50.556 --> 00:51.460
How much I love you?

00:54.774 --> 00:55.809
You're doing okay, mom.
