00:00.513 --> 00:03.868
ï»¿Of all the games in the world, which matters most?

00:04.505 --> 00:06.793
One caught in the glare of a million flashes...

00:07.253 --> 00:10.106
...or another in the hazy light of a suburban sun?

00:14.032 --> 00:19.791
Does it matter whether two or ten or ten to the power of ten people watch?

00:26.285 --> 00:27.486
Not in the heat of battle.

00:33.284 --> 00:37.293
Not when you've given everything, to give even more.

00:38.806 --> 00:44.195
Whether the pitch is a pitch, or a square of dust, every kick has a consequence.

00:44.791 --> 00:48.390
And a goal, is a goal, is a beautiful goal.

00:50.388 --> 00:54.140
The game that matters most is the one you're playing.
