"Tilt", a new feature at 360 CHICAGO, the observation deck at John Hancock Center,...

00:07.316 --> 00:10.071
...allows participants a more immersive viewing experience...

00:10.157 --> 00:12.097
...than just looking out a wall of windows.

00:12.481 --> 00:14.739
The attraction tilts downward 30 degrees,...

00:14.911 --> 00:17.932
...giving sightseers a fresh perspective on what lies below.

00:18.079 --> 00:22.075
From 1,000 feet in the air, viewers are treated to unique vistas of Lake Michigan,...

00:22.172 --> 00:24.717

In total, the metal box weighs 31,000 pounds.

Adventurers take their place, hold on...

00:39.040 --> 00:42.133
...and watch as the logic-defying angle adjustment begins.

00:42.493 --> 00:45.833
All the while, the hydraulic system and the three pistons it powers...

00:45.943 --> 00:47.849
...emit a bit of an industrial roar.

00:48.137 --> 00:52.475

00:52.635 --> 00:54.317
The experience prompted him to tweet,...

00:54.429 --> 00:56.847
"Yikes, a thousand feet up and the window's moving!"
