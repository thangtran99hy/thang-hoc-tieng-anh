Hi guys, I'm Krystin Goodwin with Buzz60,...

00:12.909 --> 00:16.695
...and here are a few tips to infuse your water with flavor and stay hydrated this summer.

00:16.961 --> 00:19.852
Fruit is a healthy and easy way to add taste to your water.

00:19.980 --> 00:21.494
Just rinse and slice the fruit,...

00:21.582 --> 00:25.530
...and use as much or as little as you'd like to create the taste you're looking for.

00:25.633 --> 00:27.049
For a light flavor with a kick,...

00:27.119 --> 00:30.985
...throw pieces of ginger root, mint leaves and lime juice into a blender.

00:31.193 --> 00:33.977
Then just add water for a crisp and refreshing taste.

00:34.303 --> 00:35.923
If you're looking for a citrusy blend,...

00:36.007 --> 00:39.527
...mix oranges, grapefruit, lemon and lime into a blender.

00:39.647 --> 00:43.991
Then add the mixture to your water for a robust taste that's loaded with vitamin C.

00:44.170 --> 00:46.427
But if you're looking for a full-on fruity taste,...

00:46.511 --> 00:48.434
...take cherries, lime and mint.

00:48.717 --> 00:52.709
Mix in to your water for a cherry lime drink with a minty twist.

00:53.018 --> 00:58.383
So stay refreshed this season and spice up your water with these spa-tastic blends.

00:58.631 --> 01:00.762
It'll taste great to hydrate.

01:01.133 --> 01:03.846
Buzz60, now you know, pass it on.
