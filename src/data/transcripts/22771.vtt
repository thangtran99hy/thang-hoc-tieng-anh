00:00.144 --> 00:04.406
Brazilian music is all about passion and joy and today we find out why.

00:07.829 --> 00:13.753
We teach the instruments that are very popular in the north of Brazil,...

00:13.911 --> 00:14.778
...in Salvador da Bahia.

00:14.962 --> 00:17.175
It's separated between two categories.

00:17.298 --> 00:20.777
The low, very low sound and the high sounds.

00:20.997 --> 00:25.479
Salvador da Bahia is known for the low sounds we call the "fondo," the background.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.623
It's like an earthquake.

00:28.491 --> 00:29.983
We're specializing in groove.

00:30.353 --> 00:35.242
We have one groove and we go from one site to another following the musical director.

00:35.338 --> 00:37.403
So, do you think anyone could learn these instruments?

00:37.603 --> 00:38.062
Of course!

00:38.277 --> 00:42.682
Here, we're living in North America and we tend to think too much,...

00:43.107 --> 00:45.166
...and rhythm is all about forgetting.

00:45.411 --> 00:49.803
In order to be good at what you do, you have to be completely free to your instruments.

00:50.141 --> 00:51.430
You have to learn from the inside.

00:51.750 --> 00:54.011
In that way, what we do is a kind of meditation.

00:54.127 --> 00:58.177
It's purely rhythm and we can play for two, three hours.

00:58.426 --> 01:02.309
We teach these instruments all in relation to one another.

01:02.790 --> 01:04.623
This instrument answers to this other one.

01:04.900 --> 01:06.025
This one and this one and this one.

01:06.103 --> 01:10.405
It's really a collective mentality where everybody is making the whole.
