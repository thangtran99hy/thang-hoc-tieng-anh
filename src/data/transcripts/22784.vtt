Spotlight on Brazil: Spain team profile.

00:04.763 --> 00:08.513
Defending champion Spain will be the team to beat in Brazil...

00:08.775 --> 00:10.174
...as they attempt to make history...

00:10.445 --> 00:15.261
...by becoming the first European nation to win the World Cup on South American soil.

00:15.554 --> 00:18.437
The Spaniards have already become the first European side...

00:18.546 --> 00:21.027
...to win three consecutive major tournaments...

00:21.579 --> 00:24.941
...and haven't conceded a goal in ten knockout matches,...

00:25.149 --> 00:28.123
...stretching back to the 2006 World Cup.

00:28.589 --> 00:32.891
In qualifying, they soar off the challenge of France to claim top spot in their group...

00:33.452 --> 00:36.877
...and will be severely tested from their very first game in Brazil,...

00:37.061 --> 00:40.508
...having been drawn to face 2010 runners-up the Netherlands.

00:40.731 --> 00:46.247
Fortunately, they have a formidable squad, including Barcelona's Andres Iniesta,...

00:47.002 --> 00:49.207
...while Boss Vicente del Bosque...

00:49.311 --> 00:54.184
...is the only manager to win the World Cup, Euros and Champions League.
