ï»¿It really makes a difference what we say.

00:04.350 --> 00:07.044
I learned this from a woman who survived Auschwitz.

00:07.300 --> 00:09.289
She went to Auschwitz when she was 15 years old,...

00:09.600 --> 00:12.296
...and her brother was eight and the parents were lost.

00:12.687 --> 00:15.973
And she told me this, "We were in the train going to Auschwitz..."

00:16.466 --> 00:18.709
"...and I looked down and I saw my brother's shoes were missing."

00:19.127 --> 00:20.552
And I said, "Why are you so stupid?"

00:20.750 --> 00:22.100
"Can't you keep your things together?"

00:22.325 --> 00:23.215
"For goodness' sake!"

00:23.499 --> 00:25.658
The way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother.

00:25.980 --> 00:29.006
Unfortunately, it was the last thing she ever said to him 'cause she never saw him again.

00:29.960 --> 00:30.896
He did not survive.

00:32.047 --> 00:34.468
And so when she came out of Auschwitz, she made a vow.

00:34.836 --> 00:37.073
She said, "I walked out of Auschwitz into life."

00:37.369 --> 00:38.372
And the vow was,...

00:38.600 --> 00:43.344
..."I will never say anything that couldn't stand as the last thing I ever say."

00:43.850 --> 00:44.993
Now, can we do that?

00:45.093 --> 00:45.350
No.

00:45.550 --> 00:47.606
But it is a possibility to live into.

00:48.086 --> 00:48.457
Thank you.
