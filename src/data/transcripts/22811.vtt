My dad can't fly.

00:06.633 --> 00:11.931
He doesn't have heat vision or even wear a cape.

00:14.297 --> 00:16.078
He doesn't battle evil villains.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.471
He's not invincible.

00:20.207 --> 00:21.869
And he can't save the universe.

00:25.881 --> 00:27.817
He doesn't have superhuman strength.

00:33.399 --> 00:37.097
He's just super because he's my dad.

00:37.760 --> 00:41.125
