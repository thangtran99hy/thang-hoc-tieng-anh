With summer sun rays, you wanna take extra care of your skin.

00:04.562 --> 00:07.435
From sunscreen application tips to key ingredients,...

00:07.533 --> 00:10.625
...you can find the best products to protect your skin this season.

00:10.788 --> 00:12.545
Hi guys, I'm Krystin Goodwin with Buzz60,...

00:12.665 --> 00:14.616
...and here are a few helpful reminders and tricks...

00:14.698 --> 00:16.747
...to protect your skin without skipping a beat.

00:16.885 --> 00:20.872
Choose a broad spectrum sunscreen with UVB and UVA protection.

00:21.005 --> 00:24.171
This will protect against burns and other skin damage.

00:24.316 --> 00:27.490
Make sure to apply sunscreen in the shade or at home 15 minutes...

00:27.581 --> 00:29.907
...before going in the sun to allow it to set.

00:30.028 --> 00:32.383
For your lips, use an SPF 30 balm.

00:32.498 --> 00:34.339
Do not use lip gloss.

00:34.446 --> 00:38.077
Gloss intensifies sun exposure and the effects of UV rays.

00:38.237 --> 00:40.160
It's like baby oil on your lips.

00:40.321 --> 00:44.174
To avoid watery eyes, use sunscreen with zinc oxide on your face.

00:44.299 --> 00:47.123
This will reduce the irritation to the skin and the eyes .

00:47.292 --> 00:51.986
While waterproof or sweatproof sunscreens are helpful, you will still need to reapply.

00:52.118 --> 00:55.983
Be sure to bring a bottle along for touch-ups and reapply every two to three hours.

00:56.126 --> 00:58.793
So protect your skin from head to toe this season.

00:58.927 --> 01:02.701
With the right skin care products, you can keep calm and put that sunscreen on.

01:03.129 --> 01:05.597
Buzz60, now you know, pass it on.
