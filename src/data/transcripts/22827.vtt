What I wanted to ask is what Phil's up to?

00:10.208 --> 00:10.585
Jack!

00:12.423 --> 00:14.444
Jack, have you seen who that is?

00:15.555 --> 00:16.484
No, it's not him, is it?

00:18.765 --> 00:19.271
It is him.

00:21.137 --> 00:22.906
He's much taller in reality, isn't he?

00:23.693 --> 00:24.406
Such a legend.

00:24.859 --> 00:26.979
He's probably the best player of his generation.

00:27.789 --> 00:28.728
Well, I'd say the best ever.

00:28.844 --> 00:30.508
I mean, winning three World Cups.

00:30.577 --> 00:30.827
I know.

00:31.901 --> 00:32.754
Oh look, here he comes.

00:41.689 --> 00:44.334
Mr. Ronaldo, could I have a picture please?

00:44.919 --> 00:45.127
Yeah!

00:45.749 --> 00:46.126
Thanks!

00:50.264 --> 00:50.615
Thank you!

00:50.951 --> 00:51.319
You're welcome.

00:55.129 --> 00:57.161
Connecting every fan of the game.

00:57.592 --> 00:58.537
Fly Emirates.

00:58.804 --> 01:00.118
Hello Tomorrow.
