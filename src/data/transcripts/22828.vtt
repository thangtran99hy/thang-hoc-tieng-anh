ï»¿To be a part of something like this is something you would never be able to recreate...

00:03.169 --> 00:04.160
...once you're done playing the game.

00:04.251 --> 00:05.887
And I'm blessed to be a part of something like this.

00:06.231 --> 00:10.627
I know we've seen the championship board already out there and the yellow tape...

00:11.421 --> 00:16.380
...and that's why you play the game to the final buzzer.

00:17.125 --> 00:19.021
James catches, puts up a three!

00:19.407 --> 00:24.449
Won't go, rebound Bosh, back out to Allen, his three-pointer. Bang!

00:25.034 --> 00:27.740
Tie game with five seconds remaining!

00:28.391 --> 00:34.820
It's back-to-back titles for the Heat, the 2013 NBA Champions yet resides once again in Miami.

00:35.909 --> 00:40.071
Parker the other way, the spin, and he puts it through.

00:40.429 --> 00:41.438
Tony Parker!

00:42.882 --> 00:44.440
Look at the speed of Leonard!

00:44.982 --> 00:46.228
He drops it in high.

00:46.474 --> 00:47.531
Oh my goodness.

00:48.455 --> 00:51.643
James on the attack to the rim and a foul!

00:52.621 --> 00:56.259
Here's Chalmers gives it up, Ray Allen will take a three for the lead.

00:56.371 --> 00:56.895
It's in!

00:57.651 --> 00:58.275
Ray Allen!
