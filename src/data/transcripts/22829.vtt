Let's face it, job hunting is, well, kind of terrible.

00:03.885 --> 00:06.976
There are so many things to look for in a potential employer...

00:07.428 --> 00:11.261
...but perhaps the most important is pay and benefits.

00:11.399 --> 00:13.333
Hey guys, I'm Andrew Dymburt for Buzz 60,...

00:13.431 --> 00:17.007
...and here are the top companies for compensation and benefits.

00:17.169 --> 00:19.652
The list was compiled by glassdoor.com,...

00:19.858 --> 00:23.891
...a job review site that used feedback from employees over the past year...

00:24.240 --> 00:28.310
...who rated their satisfaction with salary and bennies on a five-point scale.

00:28.486 --> 00:30.437
Coming in at number 25 is eBay.

00:30.591 --> 00:33.671
"Good company, great job security," reads the description,...

00:34.043 --> 00:37.206
...and pharmaceutical company Pfizer ranked 20th on the list...

00:37.554 --> 00:39.475
...as they not only provide great benefits,...

00:39.882 --> 00:44.295
...but also give employees a gym, clinic, cafeteria and a day care.

00:44.677 --> 00:47.551
There are a couple of cell phone carriers that made the list, too:...

00:47.955 --> 00:50.703
...T-Mobile at 17 and Verizon at 15.

00:50.909 --> 00:54.145
Highlighting the top five are a few familiar faces.
