ï»¿Krispy Kreme outdoes itself and every other bakery in the world.

00:04.980 --> 00:07.065
I'm Mara Montalbano for Buzz60.

00:07.170 --> 00:09.625
We've all heard of the 300-dollar burger,...

00:09.697 --> 00:12.101
...the 1,000-dollar ice cream sundae...

00:12.190 --> 00:14.049
...and the 10,000-dollar martini.

00:14.553 --> 00:18.207
Well, here's the latest edible treat that just might be too rich for your blood...

00:18.440 --> 00:19.814
...in more ways than one.

00:20.117 --> 00:23.043
It almost looks too good to eat. Almost.

00:23.304 --> 00:25.654
It actually doesn't even look like a donut at all,...

00:25.900 --> 00:28.392
...more like something you'd wear on your head to a royal wedding.

00:28.541 --> 00:32.903
Krispy Kreme in the UK has unveiled the most expensive donut in the world.

00:33.248 --> 00:36.950
The costly confection is made with edible 24-karat gold leaf,...

00:37.502 --> 00:43.105
...decorated with edible diamonds and filled with a vintage Dom Perignon champagne jelly.

00:43.323 --> 00:46.858
And to wash it down, a cocktail made with that same champagne...

00:47.129 --> 00:49.925
...and a 500-year-old Courvoisier cognac.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.340
So what does it cost?

00:52.027 --> 00:56.054
About 1,000 British pounds or $1,600 US.

00:56.156 --> 01:01.363
It was an exclusive for a charity event and was presented to a lucky contest winner...

01:01.689 --> 01:03.387
...who is probably trying to figure out...

01:03.517 --> 01:06.065
...how to wear it for a little while before she eats it.

01:06.409 --> 01:08.781
Buzz60, now you know, pass it on.
