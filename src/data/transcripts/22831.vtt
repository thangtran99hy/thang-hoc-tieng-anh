Look out leggings and yoga pants!

00:02.459 --> 00:05.659
A new jeans company is upping the comfortable legwear game...

00:05.782 --> 00:08.100
...with a denim targeted at athletes.

00:08.223 --> 00:11.357
Behold the "anti-thigh gap" jeans.

00:11.503 --> 00:13.954
Hey everybody, I'm Lisa D'Souza with Buzz60.

00:14.261 --> 00:19.257
A group of  fitness buffs in Nevada is designing jeans for the muscular body type.

00:19.675 --> 00:23.143
The co-owner of Barbell Apparel says the group was, quote,...

00:23.377 --> 00:27.697
..."tired of struggling with jeans that didn't fit and restricted our ability to move,"...

00:27.885 --> 00:31.356
...adding these jeans are very much anti-thigh gap,...

00:31.629 --> 00:36.791
...referring to a recent trend where girls strive to have a space between their upper thighs.

00:37.004 --> 00:41.784
And Barbell Apparel says its pants do much more than just fit the athletic body type.

00:42.109 --> 00:46.734
The jeans, made partially with spandex, are supposed to be comfy and flexible.

00:46.838 --> 00:51.537
The ad claims you can do yoga, lift weights, kick a ball around,...

00:51.669 --> 00:54.078
...even go for a run, all in the pants.

00:54.308 --> 00:56.627
No word yet on what they smell like after that.

00:56.870 --> 01:01.663
But the company's Kickstarter page is already raking in hundreds of thousands of dollars.

01:01.817 --> 01:05.104
Who knew denim could prove to be competition for our sweats?

01:05.295 --> 01:05.904
Buzz60.

01:06.079 --> 01:07.567
Now you know, pass it on.
