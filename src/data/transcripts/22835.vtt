I'm here to pass on some travel tips that will help make your next trip a lot easier.

00:05.161 --> 00:08.382
Let's begin with what to do before you head to the airport.

00:09.820 --> 00:13.053
Here's a phrase that will save you time: online check-in.

00:13.665 --> 00:19.131
Many airlines now allow you to check in on your computer at home up to 24 hours in advance.

00:20.023 --> 00:21.915
You can even print your boarding pass at home...

00:22.159 --> 00:24.973
...so when you arrive at the airport, you're ready for takeoff.

00:27.818 --> 00:29.087
Now, for what to bring.

00:29.654 --> 00:31.049
Be a strategic packer.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.889
That too will get you through the airport faster.

00:34.274 --> 00:38.075
If you are not planning on checking your suitcase, pack it carefully.

00:38.491 --> 00:42.467
There are strict regulations when it comes to what is an acceptable carry-on item.

00:43.997 --> 00:45.979
Think before you pack liquids and gels,...

00:46.220 --> 00:51.287
...including makeup like liquid eyeliners, lip gloss, foundation and perfumes.

00:52.588 --> 00:54.521
Whether you plan on checking luggage or not,...

00:54.869 --> 00:58.628
...do yourself a favor and bring a carry-on containing your essential items...

00:58.871 --> 01:03.939
...like medication, eyeglasses, expensive jewelry and maybe even a change of clothes.

01:04.467 --> 01:06.819
You never know if your luggage will land when you do.

01:07.198 --> 01:11.355
Having some must-haves on you may save the day and your vacation.

01:11.960 --> 01:15.301
And make sure you have identification on the luggage you do check.

01:15.665 --> 01:19.152
It's a foolproof way to be sure you're grabbing your own suitcase.

01:19.451 --> 01:22.367
And it ensures a way for others to get in touch with you...

01:22.707 --> 01:24.692
...should you and your luggage get separated.
