Spring and summer is the perfect time to have an outdoor picnic.

00:13.567 --> 00:17.129
It's a great time to get out of the house, smell the fresh air.

00:17.428 --> 00:19.426
It's also kind of romantic, too.

00:19.741 --> 00:23.674
Today, I'm gonna show you a few things I like to pack in my picnic basket.

00:23.863 --> 00:24.827
Let's get started!

00:25.049 --> 00:28.757
So for a light snack, I always like to pack a fruit and cheese platter.

00:29.090 --> 00:33.496
I usually use grapes and strawberries 'cause they go really well with cheese.

00:33.685 --> 00:36.764
Salads make a really great side dish for a picnic.

00:36.931 --> 00:41.225
Today I packed a pasta orzo salad in these cute little jars.

00:41.357 --> 00:45.654
They're portable, really fun-looking, and really cute to eat out of too.

00:46.173 --> 00:49.007
And then for the main dish I like to pack sandwiches.

00:49.177 --> 00:52.269
Sandwiches are great for picnics because you can customize them,...

00:52.370 --> 00:53.913
...you can pack them individually,...

00:54.162 --> 00:56.915
...and then also for the toppings, you can pack them on the side...

00:57.008 --> 00:59.267
...so that people can pick and choose whatever they like.

00:59.920 --> 01:02.494
Today I packed a chicken pesto sandwich.

01:02.685 --> 01:05.009
And then for desserts, my favorite part.

01:05.199 --> 01:07.326
I like to bring some cookies or brownies...

01:07.414 --> 01:11.489
...'cause they're easy to pack and they're like finger foods.

01:11.684 --> 01:15.646
Today I packed a dark chocolate with white chocolate chunk cookie.

01:15.789 --> 01:16.741
And then for the drinks.

01:16.966 --> 01:20.850
Today I brought some sparkling water and some sparkling bubblies.

01:21.037 --> 01:23.663
But a really great addition to your picnic basket...

01:23.759 --> 01:27.748
...would be some sparkling fruit juice, juice, or even soda.

01:27.913 --> 01:29.968
And then to add some final touches.

01:30.332 --> 01:34.833
I like to use real silverware and plates because it adds that homey touch to it.

01:35.182 --> 01:39.058
And then some fabric napkins because it adds a pop of color.

01:39.313 --> 01:42.448
And always have a fresh bouquet of flowers to liven things up.

01:43.152 --> 01:44.809
And there's my picnic basket!

01:44.924 --> 01:46.410
What do you like to pack in yours?
