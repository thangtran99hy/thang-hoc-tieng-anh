Tonight, we're in the hallowed halls of the United Nations.

00:04.710 --> 00:07.490
And one of the key principles in the UN Charter...

00:08.125 --> 00:12.284
...is to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights,...

00:12.682 --> 00:15.137
...in the dignity and worth of the human person,...

00:15.714 --> 00:20.589
...in the equal rights of men and women and nations large and small.

00:22.123 --> 00:26.019
These are very simple yet very powerful words...

00:26.811 --> 00:30.671
...and they are at the core of my beliefs and values.

00:31.933 --> 00:38.483
Growing up in Alabama in the 1960s, I saw the devastating impacts of discrimination.

00:39.837 --> 00:45.601
Remarkable people were denied opportunities and treated without basic human dignity...

00:46.061 --> 00:48.451
...solely because of the color of their skin.

00:50.207 --> 00:54.739
And not far from where I lived, I remember very vividly...

00:55.579 --> 00:59.949
...witnessing a cross burning at such a remarkable family.

01:01.787 --> 01:09.067
This image was permanently imprinted in my brain and it would change my life forever.

01:10.979 --> 01:14.033
For me, the cross burning was a symbol of ignorance,...

01:14.509 --> 01:18.391
...of hatred and a fear of anyone different than the majority.

01:19.715 --> 01:21.112
I could never understand it...

01:22.361 --> 01:28.471
...and I knew then that America's and Alabama's history would always be scarred...

01:29.227 --> 01:30.730
...by the hatred that it represented.

01:32.134 --> 01:38.432
Since these early days, I have seen and I've experienced many other types of discrimination...

01:39.528 --> 01:46.259
...and all of them were rooted in the fear of people that were different than the majority.

01:48.236 --> 01:50.752
In my office, if you were so to come visit me,...

01:51.614 --> 01:55.485
...and I encourage you to do it, you would see three photos.

01:57.021 --> 02:01.683
Two are of Robert Kennedy and one is of Reverend Martin Luther King.

02:02.891 --> 02:06.408
They sacrificed everything, including their lives,...

02:06.926 --> 02:09.645
...as champions of human rights and human dignity.

02:10.769 --> 02:12.691
Their images inspire me.

02:13.748 --> 02:19.442
They serve as a reminder to me every day that regardless of the path that one chooses,...

02:19.875 --> 02:23.962
...there are fundamental commitments that should be a part one's journey.

02:25.683 --> 02:27.823
For this reason and many others,...

02:28.360 --> 02:32.394
...I was very fortunate that my life's journey took me to Apple.

02:33.489 --> 02:38.146
In addition to finding a company and a founder unlike any other,...

02:39.067 --> 02:44.171
...I found in Apple a company that deeply believed in advancing humanity...

02:44.727 --> 02:49.140
...through its products and through the equality of all of its employees.

02:50.215 --> 02:52.663
Now much has changed since my early days at Apple,...

02:53.658 --> 02:59.715
..but these values, which are at the very heart of our company, remain the same.
