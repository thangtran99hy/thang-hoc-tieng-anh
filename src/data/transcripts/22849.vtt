You can spend your whole life imagining ghosts, worrying about the pathway to the future...

00:05.293 --> 00:08.265
...but all there will ever be is what's happening here...

00:09.137 --> 00:13.441
...and the decisions we make in this moment which are based in either love or fear.

00:14.718 --> 00:18.452
So many of us choose our path out of fear disguised as practicality.

00:20.833 --> 00:24.426
What we really want seems impossibly out of reach and ridiculous to expect...

00:24.541 --> 00:26.615
...so we never dare to ask the universe for it.

00:26.783 --> 00:31.912
I'm saying I'm the proof that you can ask the universe for it.

00:33.427 --> 00:35.751
And if it doesn't happen for you right away,...

00:35.839 --> 00:39.706
...it's only because the universe is so busy fulfilling my order.

00:41.146 --> 00:42.582
Party size!

00:45.844 --> 00:47.605
My father could have been a great comedian...

00:47.699 --> 00:49.815
...but he didn't believe that that was possible for him.

00:50.230 --> 00:52.178
And so, he made a conservative choice.

00:52.575 --> 00:54.704
Instead, he got a safe job as an accountant.

00:55.126 --> 00:58.932
And when I was 12 years old, he was let go from that safe job...

00:59.610 --> 01:01.653
...and our family had to do whatever we could do to survive.

01:02.356 --> 01:04.383
I learned many great lessons from my father,...

01:04.901 --> 01:08.513
...not the least of which was that you can fail at what you don't want.

01:08.900 --> 01:12.099
So, you might as well take a chance on doing what you love.
