One of the hardest things when you're trying to effect change...

00:06.365 --> 00:13.497
...is that people like this gentleman are right in some areas.

00:13.783 --> 00:17.319
And, one of the things I've always found is...

00:17.799 --> 00:25.771
...that you've got to start with the customer experience...

00:25.868 --> 00:28.357
...and work backwards to the technology.

00:29.201 --> 00:31.389
You can't start with the technology...

00:31.537 --> 00:34.533
...and try to figure out where you're gonna try to sell it,...

00:34.611 --> 00:37.573
...and I've made this mistake probably more than anybody else in this room.

00:38.049 --> 00:46.033
And as we have tried to come up with a strategy and a vision for Apple,...

00:48.854 --> 00:55.213
...it started with, "What incredible benefits can we give to the customer?"

00:55.305 --> 00:56.973
"Where can we take the customer?"

00:58.580 --> 01:02.277
Not starting with, "Let's sit down with the engineers"...

01:03.097 --> 01:06.319
..."and figure out what awesome technology we have"...

01:06.417 --> 01:07.975
..."and then how are we gonna market that?"

01:10.837 --> 01:13.574
And I think that's the right path to take.

01:13.967 --> 01:19.063
There's a whole lot of people working super, super hard right now at Apple.

01:19.211 --> 01:22.588
The whole team is working, burning the midnight oil,...

01:22.720 --> 01:24.030
...and they're doing their best.

01:24.221 --> 01:26.153
Some mistakes will be made along the way.

01:26.445 --> 01:29.925
That's good because at least some decisions are being made along the way...

01:30.293 --> 01:33.029
...and we'll find the mistakes, we'll fix them.

01:33.745 --> 01:36.791
Mistakes we made, some people will be pissed off,...

01:37.214 --> 01:39.353
...some people will not know what they're talking about,...

01:39.645 --> 01:45.911
...but I think it is so much better than where things were not very long ago.

01:46.271 --> 01:47.460
And I think we're gonna get there.
