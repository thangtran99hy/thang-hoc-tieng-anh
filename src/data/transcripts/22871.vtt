ï»¿So Abby, fresh off the plane I hear.

00:01.982 --> 00:03.305
Two weeks, actually.

00:03.491 --> 00:03.957
Cheers!

00:04.175 --> 00:05.175
Welcome to Japan!

00:07.494 --> 00:07.851
Ethan?

00:08.319 --> 00:09.912
The rent's paid off for the next six months.

00:09.980 --> 00:11.257
You can stay, it's all right with me.

00:11.606 --> 00:12.347
For Abby...

00:12.638 --> 00:13.267
What should I do?

00:13.825 --> 00:14.463
What should I do?

00:14.653 --> 00:16.955
...what seemed like the bitter end...

00:17.063 --> 00:19.981
I thought it was so brave coming to Tokyo,...

00:20.169 --> 00:22.218
...but Ethan left me.

00:23.605 --> 00:24.479
...was the beginning...

00:25.000 --> 00:25.741
Ramen.

00:26.331 --> 00:27.457
Ramen.

00:27.679 --> 00:28.922
...of a new journey.

00:34.475 --> 00:35.667
I wanna cook ramen.

00:37.789 --> 00:39.806
I wanna make people happy the way you do.

00:44.755 --> 00:45.093
Hi!

00:45.977 --> 00:47.117
I will clean for you.

00:47.418 --> 00:50.261
I'll clean the windows, the pots, the floors.

00:51.459 --> 00:53.879
I'm training to become a ramen chef.

01:00.343 --> 01:01.699
I think I know, let me try.

01:06.057 --> 01:08.038
I did everything I saw you do.

01:13.084 --> 01:17.047
There's something about the Japanese and making the perfect bowl of soup.

01:17.751 --> 01:18.926
It's kind of beautiful.

01:20.235 --> 01:22.818
You are my successor.

01:23.299 --> 01:24.382
I'd be honored.
