I started off on the baby slopes and surprisingly, I was actually able to stand up on the board.

00:16.218 --> 00:18.145
I was so thinking I was gonna fall.

00:19.857 --> 00:24.858
And then I felt pretty confident and somehow I got talked into going to this big mama sand dune.

00:25.330 --> 00:27.099
Okay boys, what's next?

00:27.191 --> 00:29.243
That is like a death warrant, basically.

00:31.019 --> 00:32.275
But I don't know what came over me...

00:33.015 --> 00:37.333
...but somehow I mustered up the courage to go flying down this huge sand dune.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.589
No, I'm so scared!

00:40.939 --> 00:41.943
I'm so scared.

00:47.097 --> 00:50.860
I was flying down and I just heard someone say, "Just relax and enjoy the feeling."

00:50.932 --> 00:52.904
And I'm like, "That's a really good idea, maybe I'll just do that."

00:53.422 --> 00:57.010
And I was just flying and flying and I felt...

00:57.614 --> 00:59.406
...I'm scraped here and I'm scraped here.

00:59.481 --> 01:03.332
And I hit my chin but it was just like, it was awesome.

01:04.035 --> 01:07.215
I've discovered something about myself today that I didn't know I had in me.

01:07.407 --> 01:07.909
That's for sure.

01:07.979 --> 01:14.449
I didn't know that I could have the guts to do that and then actually do it,...

01:15.680 --> 01:16.829
...and still be in one piece.
