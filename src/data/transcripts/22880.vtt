My name is Mary Yuan...

00:05.111 --> 00:09.677
...and I'm a senior public relations manager in corporate communications at AT&T.

00:10.473 --> 00:15.601
I think my favorite part about working here is probably the environment.

00:15.695 --> 00:20.421
It's a really, really fast-paced environment, but it's also really collaborative.

00:20.791 --> 00:26.487
And so you have a lot of people with different expertise all working together...

00:26.593 --> 00:31.837
...and so you really get a taste of different parts of corporate communications.

00:32.192 --> 00:36.751
And so when you're putting together a plan, you have all of these unique perspectives...

00:36.821 --> 00:40.661
...that really makes the overall plan a much better one.

00:40.931 --> 00:44.295
So, I think the collaborative environment and all of these people...

00:44.392 --> 00:47.581
...who are coming from different backgrounds really make it fun to work here.
