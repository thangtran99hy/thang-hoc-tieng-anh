00:02.807 --> 00:05.709
Listen, if you can run a mile, run a race.

00:08.133 --> 00:08.547
You know what?

00:09.183 --> 00:10.164
Run a marathon.

00:11.958 --> 00:13.326
Outrun a movie star.

00:16.376 --> 00:19.259
If you can ride a bike, ride that thing.

00:20.308 --> 00:20.881
Ride a bull.

00:21.443 --> 00:22.437
Ride a tougher bull.

00:23.314 --> 00:24.091
Let's watch this.

00:25.059 --> 00:25.961
What kind of bull is that?

00:26.697 --> 00:29.207
If you can move your hips, if you can dance,...

00:29.386 --> 00:31.779
...move your legs, move your feet, move the ball.

00:31.903 --> 00:32.706
Is that Pique?

00:33.101 --> 00:33.893
Score the goal.

00:34.403 --> 00:35.255
Yeah, that is Pique.

00:38.039 --> 00:38.922
You like to fight?

00:39.691 --> 00:41.267
Well, pick on someone your own size.

00:41.399 --> 00:43.039
Pick on someone twice your size.

00:43.567 --> 00:44.275
Pick on him.

00:44.805 --> 00:45.442
That's not good.

00:47.238 --> 00:47.885
Lesson learned.

00:48.948 --> 00:51.671
If you can play table tennis, serve like that.

00:52.233 --> 00:52.921
Beat the champ.

00:53.736 --> 00:54.737
Beat her mentor.

00:55.103 --> 00:55.987
Come on, you got this.

00:57.167 --> 00:57.928
Beat Serena.

01:00.772 --> 01:03.789
If you can beat your friend one-on-one, beat him.

01:04.195 --> 01:04.742
Steal it.

01:05.213 --> 01:05.577
Take it.

01:05.972 --> 01:06.780
Sorry, girls.

01:07.523 --> 01:09.236
Now, take your talents to the streets.

01:09.470 --> 01:10.921
Beat the street court legend.

01:11.497 --> 01:11.971
That's good.

01:12.520 --> 01:13.387
Beat that guy.

01:13.713 --> 01:14.040
Hold on.

01:14.857 --> 01:15.773
We've been waiting for this.

01:22.041 --> 01:22.569
That was nice.

01:24.631 --> 01:25.290
Good luck with that.
