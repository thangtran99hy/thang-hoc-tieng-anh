I love traveling because it allows me to have an open mind...

00:07.993 --> 00:11.356
...and it gives me a new perspective on life.

00:12.495 --> 00:17.879
I started my blog because I wanted to help other deaf people to travel...

00:18.006 --> 00:20.729
...and to enjoy traveling as much as I do.

00:24.279 --> 00:27.756
My iPad is one of my traveling companions.

00:28.651 --> 00:30.583
I always have it with me.

00:32.159 --> 00:36.813
iPad has given me the tools that I need to get out there and see the world.

00:39.359 --> 00:43.858
I tell people not to be afraid, to not let anything hold them back.

00:43.941 --> 00:45.939
I never let anything hold me back.

00:47.633 --> 00:49.347
I don't want to miss anything.

00:52.062 --> 00:53.377
Hi Cherie.

00:54.659 --> 00:56.487
Where are you going next?
