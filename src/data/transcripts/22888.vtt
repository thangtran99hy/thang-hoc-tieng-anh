00:00.262 --> 00:01.577
This is what I wanna share.

00:02.505 --> 00:08.391
It doesn't matter how far you might rise, at some point you are bound to stumble...

00:08.485 --> 00:14.011
...because if you're constantly doing what we do, raising the bar,...

00:14.275 --> 00:19.351
...if you are constantly pushing yourself higher, higher, the law of averages,...

00:19.489 --> 00:25.889
...not to mention the myth of Icarus, predicts that you will at some point fall.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.805
And when you do, I want you to know this, remember this:...

00:30.410 --> 00:32.522
....There is no such thing as failure.

00:32.952 --> 00:37.949
Failure is just life trying to move us in another direction.

00:38.035 --> 00:41.028
Now, when you're down there in a hole, it looks like failure.

00:42.053 --> 00:46.270
So, this past year I had to spoon-feed those words to myself.

00:47.107 --> 00:49.873
And when you're down in a hole, when that moment comes,...

00:49.990 --> 00:53.287
...it's really okay to feel bad for a little while.

00:53.584 --> 00:58.274
Give yourself time to mourn what you think you may have lost.

00:58.841 --> 01:04.439
But then, here's the key: learn from every mistake...

01:04.864 --> 01:10.610
...because every experience, encounter and particularly your mistakes...

01:10.924 --> 01:15.959
...are there to teach you and force you into being more of who you are.

01:16.647 --> 01:21.382
And then, figure out what is the next right move.

01:21.888 --> 01:28.437
And the key to life is to develop an internal moral, emotional GPS...

01:28.699 --> 01:31.451
...that can tell you which way to go.

01:32.066 --> 01:34.804
Because now and forevermore, when you Google yourself,...

01:37.232 --> 01:42.985
...your search results will read "Harvard 2013".

01:43.921 --> 01:48.797
And in a very competitive world, that really is a calling card...

01:48.906 --> 01:53.225
...'cause I can tell you, as one who employs a lot of people, when I see "Harvard"...

01:53.315 --> 01:56.241
...I sit up a little straighter and say, "Where is he or she?"

01:56.387 --> 01:57.445
"Bring them in."
