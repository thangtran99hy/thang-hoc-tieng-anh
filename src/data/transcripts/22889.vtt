Today we have something extra special for you guys,...

00:09.497 --> 00:12.703
...and you guys will be some of the first people outside of our team...

00:12.768 --> 00:14.709
...and outside of Google to ever ride in it.

00:19.677 --> 00:20.984
Oh, there it is!

00:21.328 --> 00:22.818
Isn't that cute?

00:23.527 --> 00:25.419
There's no steering wheel in the way.

00:30.207 --> 00:34.017
It was a big decision for us to go and start building our purpose-built vehicles first...

00:34.242 --> 00:36.471
...and really they're prototype vehicles.

00:36.716 --> 00:39.185
They were a chance for us to explore...

00:39.348 --> 00:41.952
...what does it really mean to have a self-driving vehicle.

00:42.489 --> 00:44.747
But in the small amount of time we've been working on it,...

00:44.941 --> 00:47.244
...now we have functional prototypes and that's exciting.

00:48.759 --> 00:50.133
Oh, it's really cool!

00:50.225 --> 00:53.759
It was really kind of a space-age experience.

00:56.221 --> 00:57.445
We're like queens.

00:59.029 --> 01:02.484
You sit, relax, you don't have to do nothing.

01:02.669 --> 01:05.632
It knows when it needs to stop, it knows when it needs to go.

01:06.917 --> 01:09.629
It actually rides better than my own car.

01:09.715 --> 01:11.025
Yes, it's true.

01:11.239 --> 01:15.362
What she really liked was that it slowed down before it went around a curve...

01:15.659 --> 01:18.033
...and then accelerated in the curve.

01:18.119 --> 01:20.490
She's always trying to get me to do it that way.

01:20.625 --> 01:22.797
That's the way I learned in a high school driver's ed.

01:26.084 --> 01:30.017
So, if I had a self-driving car, I could spend more time hanging out with my kids...

01:30.132 --> 01:31.621
...or helping them with their homework,...

01:31.783 --> 01:34.326
...even just tending to them, finding out how their day was...

01:34.413 --> 01:36.917
...and not having to wait 'til you get home and have dinner and all that...

01:37.037 --> 01:38.082
...so it'll be good.
