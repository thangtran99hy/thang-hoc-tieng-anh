00:00.227 --> 00:01.487
So in your annual letter this year,...

00:01.573 --> 00:04.827
...you talk about myths that block progress for poor people.

00:04.915 --> 00:05.849
What are some of those?

00:06.252 --> 00:09.289
Well, first I'd say is the myth that poor countries stay poor...

00:09.442 --> 00:13.426
...when in fact we've gone from most countries being poor when I was born...

00:13.531 --> 00:16.892
...to in the next 25 years we'll have very, very few.

00:17.002 --> 00:20.864
Melinda, you address the common perception that saving children's lives...

00:20.960 --> 00:22.615
...would somehow lead to overpopulation.

00:22.705 --> 00:24.480
How could that be a so-called myth?

00:24.573 --> 00:28.038
The fact is that as a country's child mortality rate decreases,...

00:28.155 --> 00:30.848
...so does the number of children that women choose to have.

00:30.999 --> 00:31.785
How do you know?

00:31.869 --> 00:34.165
How can you prove that these are myths?

00:34.258 --> 00:35.337
I mean, is there evidence?

00:35.443 --> 00:40.185
We've got some really bright and amazing people that look at these figures and chart it out...

00:40.267 --> 00:43.912
...and they're the ones who can show you how busted these myths are.

00:44.116 --> 00:45.813
So, you have experts on this?

00:46.164 --> 00:50.893
I guess my next question is can our viewers get a look at these so-called experts?

00:51.226 --> 00:52.237
Yeah, I think so.

00:52.328 --> 00:53.178
Yeah, absolutely.

00:53.255 --> 00:53.617
Follow us.

00:53.759 --> 00:54.335
All right.

00:55.574 --> 00:56.599
Where'd we put them?

00:56.861 --> 00:58.650
Yeah, they're back here somewhere.

00:58.735 --> 00:59.717
I know they're back here.

00:59.841 --> 01:01.168
Yeah, yeah, I think this is it.

01:02.719 --> 01:04.422
This one is totally busted, dude.

01:04.669 --> 01:05.053
Yeah.

01:05.177 --> 01:06.209
Oh, hi guys.

01:06.320 --> 01:06.835
Hey!

01:06.908 --> 01:08.026
Hi Melinda. Hi Bill.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.562
We are rapidly working our way through this stack of myths you sent down.

01:12.320 --> 01:14.033
People believe the craziest stuff.

01:14.302 --> 01:16.077
We got some really interesting results.

01:16.155 --> 01:17.252
Oh, right, the results.

01:17.621 --> 01:20.235
So far, poor countries doomed to stay poor: busted,...

01:20.588 --> 01:22.653
...aid is a big waste: totally busted,...

01:22.746 --> 01:25.788
...and saving lives will contribute to overpopulation: totally busted.

01:25.983 --> 01:27.011
We had a little extra time...

01:27.108 --> 01:30.463
...so right now, we're testing whether mosquitoes can be hit by lasers.

01:30.574 --> 01:33.881
Yeah, that one was confirmed.

01:34.835 --> 01:36.065
You guys look really busy.

01:36.155 --> 01:37.243
We'll let you get back to it.

01:37.833 --> 01:38.111
Okay.

01:38.183 --> 01:39.025
Thanks for all your help.

01:39.221 --> 01:40.203
Yes, thanks!

01:40.793 --> 01:43.759
Hey, could we maybe get a cup of coffee or a sandwich or something?
