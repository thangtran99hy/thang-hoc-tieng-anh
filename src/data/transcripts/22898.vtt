ï»¿Hello everyone!

00:04.473 --> 00:05.389
I'm Jimmy Conrad.

00:05.465 --> 00:06.537
I'm Hugh Wizzy.

00:06.625 --> 00:10.153
And after a rigorous qualification process, three tough games in the group...

00:10.307 --> 00:13.454
...and survival in the first two rounds of the knockout stages,...

00:13.735 --> 00:15.545
...there are four countries left in the World Cup.

00:15.641 --> 00:19.427
Three of whom won 10 of the 19 World Cups have been played all time...

00:19.701 --> 00:21.724
...and a country that has been to the final three times.

00:21.809 --> 00:22.220
That's right!

00:22.537 --> 00:24.526
I'm talking about Brazil, Argentina, Germany...

00:24.589 --> 00:27.330
...and everyone's favorite second place team, the Netherlands.

00:27.418 --> 00:30.997
So let's kick things off with the mouth-watering tie between the host and Germany.

00:31.254 --> 00:35.011
A repeat of the 2002 final where El Phenomeno scored in magical ways...

00:35.119 --> 00:36.880
...to give Brazil their 5th World Cup title.

00:37.262 --> 00:39.655
This time around though they have Fred in the sacred number nine...

00:40.051 --> 00:43.369
...and they also have been missing the injured Neymar and Captain Thiago Silva,...

00:43.448 --> 00:45.693
...arguably their two most important players.

00:45.811 --> 00:48.914
Without Neymar and Thiago Silva, Germany's class will shine through...

00:49.004 --> 00:52.711
...and I even expect Miroslav Klose to break the record he shares with Ronaldo...

00:52.816 --> 00:56.253
...for most goals scored in the World Cup against Brazil in Brazil.

00:56.588 --> 00:57.739
Germany 2, Brazil 1.

00:58.393 --> 01:00.835
The Netherlands will look to prove the history and the staff...

01:00.969 --> 01:06.081
...that no European team has ever won a World Cup on South American soil before is nothing to fear.

01:06.215 --> 01:08.335
Now, despite my admiration for the Dutch this tournament,...

01:08.513 --> 01:11.565
...I don't believe that two European teams are going to make the final.

01:11.667 --> 01:13.375
And since I think Germany to get past Brazil...

01:13.653 --> 01:16.755
...then that means by our superior logic because I agree with you,...

01:17.065 --> 01:19.268
...Leo Messi is going to find a way to win this game...

01:19.545 --> 01:23.321
...and get one step closer to the World Cup trophy and immortality...

01:23.727 --> 01:25.211
...as Argentina wins this 1-0.

01:25.301 --> 01:27.649
So that's who we like to win this semifinals.

01:27.861 --> 01:28.957
Who do you guys like and why?
