00:01.503 --> 00:01.831
ï»¿Better.

00:03.867 --> 00:08.083
It's a powerful word and a powerful ideal.

00:10.085 --> 00:14.389
It makes us look at the world and want more than anything to change it for the better.

00:15.545 --> 00:17.720
To innovate, improve.

00:18.933 --> 00:19.945
To reinvent.

00:20.874 --> 00:23.118
To make it better.

00:24.214 --> 00:25.423
It's in our DNA.

00:26.647 --> 00:30.650
And better can't be better if it doesn't consider everything.
