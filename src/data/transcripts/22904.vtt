A century ago, our foreparents marched off to the First World War.

00:10.031 --> 00:15.540
We're honoring their sacrifice by creating four centenary woods across the UK.

00:16.731 --> 00:21.565
Peaceful woods that will stand in tribute to all those who took part in the war effort.

00:22.248 --> 00:26.535
Life-giving woods that will provide a home for all sorts of plants and animals...

00:26.807 --> 00:28.734
...for future generations to enjoy.

00:29.832 --> 00:34.203
It's an ambitious, unique woodland project and we really need your help.

00:34.721 --> 00:35.940
Will you stand with us?

00:38.319 --> 00:41.548
The Centenary Woods will stand for generations to come.

00:42.512 --> 00:46.067
A living, breathing tribute to all those who served in the First World War...

00:46.768 --> 00:51.408
...which our children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren can hope to enjoy.

00:52.459 --> 00:57.866
An inspiring woodland conservation opportunity which you can be part of.

00:58.520 --> 01:00.649
So please stand with us.
