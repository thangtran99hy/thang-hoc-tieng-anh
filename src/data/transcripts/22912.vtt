People, when they say, "You're an inspiration,"...

00:04.998 --> 00:06.427
...they mean it as a compliment.

00:07.043 --> 00:08.141
They mean it as a compliment.

00:08.549 --> 00:09.769
And I know why it happens.

00:09.851 --> 00:11.122
It's because of the lie,...

00:11.251 --> 00:15.435
...it's because we've been sold this lie that disability makes you exceptional.

00:16.172 --> 00:17.425
And it honestly doesn't.

00:18.343 --> 00:19.455
And I know what you're thinking.

00:19.529 --> 00:22.844
You know, I'm up here bagging out inspiration, and you're thinking,...

00:22.945 --> 00:27.105
..."Jeez, Stella, aren't you inspired sometimes by some things?"

00:28.137 --> 00:29.977
And the thing is, I am.

00:30.253 --> 00:32.709
I learn from other disabled people all the time.

00:33.288 --> 00:39.069
I really wanna live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.

00:39.582 --> 00:43.175
I want to live in a world where a 15-year-old girl sitting in her bedroom...

00:43.484 --> 00:45.355
...watching "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"...

00:45.598 --> 00:50.189
...isn't referred to as achieving anything because she's doing it sitting down.

00:50.566 --> 00:56.254
I wanna live in a world where we don't have such low expectations of disabled people...

00:56.517 --> 00:58.847
...that we are congratulated for getting out of bed...

00:58.918 --> 01:00.973
...and remembering our own names in the morning.

01:01.815 --> 01:06.401
I wanna live in a world where we value genuine achievement for disabled people.

01:06.891 --> 01:11.705
And I wanna live in a world where a kid in year 11 in a Melbourne high school...

01:11.943 --> 01:17.013
...is not one bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair user.

01:17.319 --> 01:20.220
Disability doesn't make you exceptional,...

01:20.391 --> 01:23.076
...but questioning what you think you know about it does.

01:23.701 --> 01:24.447
Thank you.
