Since the dark days, our great nation has known only peace.

00:16.306 --> 00:22.003
Ours is an elegant system, conceived to nourish and protect.

00:23.600 --> 00:29.227
Your districts are the body, the Capitol is the beating heart.

00:31.686 --> 00:38.475
Your hard work feeds us, and in return we feed and protect you.

00:39.984 --> 00:42.873
But if you resist the system, you starve yourself.

00:43.449 --> 00:47.141
If you fight against it, it is you who will bleed.

00:48.551 --> 00:55.049

Panem today, Panem tomorrow, Panem forever.
