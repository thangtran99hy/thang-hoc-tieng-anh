ï»¿Lebron James is going back to the Cleveland Cavaliers.

00:03.635 --> 00:06.803
James tells Sports Illustrated that he's decided to go home.

00:07.143 --> 00:09.637
James is from Akron, Ohio not far from Cleveland.

00:09.861 --> 00:12.530
It's a move that would have seemed unfathomable four years ago...

00:12.928 --> 00:16.931
...after the venomous fallout that followed his decision to leave Cleveland for the Miami Heat.

00:17.234 --> 00:21.435
James told SI, "My relationship with Northeast Ohio is bigger than basketball."

00:21.920 --> 00:24.754
"I didn't realize that four years ago, I do now."

00:24.882 --> 00:27.504
He spent his first seven NBA seasons in Cleveland.

00:27.892 --> 00:32.573
In four years with the Heat, he went to the NBA finals four times, winning two championships.

00:32.986 --> 00:36.277
And now, he heads back to Cleveland to see if he can finally deliver on his promise...

00:36.617 --> 00:38.895
...of winning the crown for that title-starved city.
