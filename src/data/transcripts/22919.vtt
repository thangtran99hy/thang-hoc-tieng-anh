00:00.067 --> 00:04.445
ï»¿Germany's players and supporters could barely tear themselves away from the Maracana...

00:04.525 --> 00:09.399
...as Brazil's World Cup got the winners it deserved and the winning goal it deserved.

00:09.973 --> 00:13.545
It was a joyous scene and one in which no luck was involved.

00:14.049 --> 00:17.037
This was a World Cup victory, their fourth...

00:17.333 --> 00:19.895
...by German design and years in the making...

00:20.126 --> 00:25.549
...the 1-0 final win over Argentina was merely confirmation of the success of a strategy...

00:25.623 --> 00:31.313
...forged on embarrassments at successive Euros in 2000 and 2004.

00:31.800 --> 00:35.399
When Mario Gotze took Andre Schurrle's pass on his chest...

00:35.484 --> 00:37.704
...with only seven minutes of extra time left...

00:37.771 --> 00:41.665
...and volleyed his finish past Argentine keeper Sergio Romero,...

00:41.873 --> 00:44.190
...it was not simply a German win for now,...

00:44.393 --> 00:48.133
...it could be one that sets the platform for years of success.
