00:00.813 --> 00:04.169
It goes without saying therefore that you have to be supremely fit...

00:04.373 --> 00:05.933
...to compete in the Tour de France.

00:06.402 --> 00:10.007
Many experts rated the toughest of all major sporting events...

00:10.210 --> 00:13.633
...and participants burn up to 7,000 calories per stage.

00:13.983 --> 00:17.621
Bear in mind that an average person in a day would burn 2,000.

00:18.069 --> 00:20.774
Heart rates can also reach dangerous limits...

00:20.979 --> 00:24.775
...when climbing stages reaching upwards of 200 beats per minute.

00:25.001 --> 00:27.087
But aside from being a supreme athlete...

00:27.214 --> 00:30.576
...and having to overcome the physical and mental challenges of the race...

00:30.773 --> 00:32.816
...as well as having a good team behind you,...

00:33.054 --> 00:34.950
...you need to also have a bit of luck...

00:35.035 --> 00:37.436
...and nerves of steel as there are many hazards...

00:37.725 --> 00:41.790
...that can reduce any rider's dream of winning the Tour into a nightmare.

00:42.100 --> 00:46.517
There's a lot to the Tour de France that all of it makes for one of the most amazing...

00:46.624 --> 00:50.259
...and memorable sporting events and spectacles on the face of the planet.
