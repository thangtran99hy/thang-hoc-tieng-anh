ï»¿Oh my!

00:03.695 --> 00:04.604
Hello out there.

00:04.965 --> 00:06.705
I'm Mr. Sulu of Star Trek.

00:06.916 --> 00:10.239
As far as I can remember, I have always been me.

00:11.040 --> 00:15.036
I have to tell you that in my e-mail, no one gets more positives than George.

00:15.211 --> 00:17.889
I totally love your smart humor on Facebook.

00:18.488 --> 00:21.235
I was the best helmsman in the galaxy,...

00:21.589 --> 00:26.079
...and put to rest all that stereotype about Asian drivers.

00:26.433 --> 00:27.747
Aye, aye, sir, warp three.

00:34.975 --> 00:38.778
My father told me, "Look at the kind of roles that Asians are playing."

00:39.915 --> 00:42.295
And I said "Daddy, I'm gonna change it."

00:43.065 --> 00:46.691
There weren't many Asians on television, so when George would come on,...

00:46.777 --> 00:48.287
...it would be a special thing.

00:48.696 --> 00:50.761
And he was kind of a sex symbol.

00:57.965 --> 01:01.124
In order for me to have a viable career, I was closeted.

01:01.577 --> 01:05.247
I can't imagine what it would be like to have to hide that identity.

01:07.023 --> 01:09.879
We're a good fit because Brad is detail-oriented,...

01:10.107 --> 01:13.285
...but he sometimes gets a little overwhelmed.

01:13.442 --> 01:14.427
This is, it's all right.

01:14.591 --> 01:15.339
This is our house.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.147
We're not filming in front of our house.

01:18.822 --> 01:23.385
My life has been transformed as fantastically as science fiction.

01:23.921 --> 01:26.294
As a boy, I looked out on the world,...

01:26.761 --> 01:31.033
...imprisoned behind the barbed wire fences of American internment camps.

01:31.561 --> 01:34.988
It was a painful moment there.

01:35.231 --> 01:37.487
I don't believe in negativity.

01:38.005 --> 01:40.121
You determine your destiny.

01:42.491 --> 01:43.877
George is the love of my life.

01:44.031 --> 01:45.174
I'm proud of him.

01:45.460 --> 01:46.419
I've heard that before.

01:48.747 --> 01:52.412
What makes it appealing is that people feel like they have a very real connection to him.

01:54.064 --> 01:56.804
I hope he realizes what he has succeeded in doing.

01:56.948 --> 01:59.783
It's okay to be Takei.

02:01.521 --> 02:03.073
Could you open the Fritos, please?
