On July 16th 1969, the nation watched...

00:03.947 --> 00:04.879
Liftoff.

00:05.053 --> 00:06.320
We have a liftoff.

00:06.477 --> 00:08.956
...as US astronauts blasted off into space...

00:09.074 --> 00:11.544
...on a mission to land on the surface of the moon.

00:11.933 --> 00:16.438
Four days and a quarter of a million miles later, the nation's dream became reality.

00:16.967 --> 00:18.035
The Eagle has landed.

00:18.363 --> 00:19.689
Man made it to the moon.

00:20.010 --> 00:23.508
The moment so surreal, veteran news anchors left without words.

00:24.855 --> 00:25.140
Boy!

00:26.311 --> 00:28.832
45 years later outside Space Center Houston,...

00:29.307 --> 00:30.219
Yet today, I was speechless.

00:30.599 --> 00:33.309
...Houstonians that witnessed the feat are still in awe.

00:33.730 --> 00:40.159
I just remember being glued to the TV, to just being able to see the events unfold,...

00:40.747 --> 00:43.353
...that it was larger than life.

00:43.647 --> 00:46.725
To get from Earth to the moon, that's a huge thing...

00:46.822 --> 00:54.065
...and so you just appreciate everybody who sacrificed to get us there.
