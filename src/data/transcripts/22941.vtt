XXX: when one X isn't enough.

00:07.896 --> 00:13.311
Me, Kobe, LeBron, we're in another stratosphere.

00:13.489 --> 00:15.370
I hear people talk about me so much.

00:15.953 --> 00:19.188
And I forget, I really am great.

00:19.919 --> 00:22.615
I'm just like you but ten times better.

00:23.773 --> 00:26.618
When you think of MJ, what's the first thing that comes to your mind?

00:26.761 --> 00:27.109
Me.

00:28.693 --> 00:29.179
I know.

00:30.401 --> 00:33.309
It's, like, people say, "Hey, you don't wanna swim with sharks,"...

00:33.414 --> 00:35.948
...but I'm faster than sharks so it's not a big deal.

00:37.504 --> 00:41.483
I think sometimes I hear people talk about me so much...

00:41.617 --> 00:44.575
...that I forget, like, "Hey, open your ears, listen to these people."

00:44.811 --> 00:45.261
They're smart.

00:45.464 --> 00:46.303
They know you're great.

00:47.797 --> 00:49.969
Why do companies ask me to push products?

00:50.938 --> 00:52.244
Because I move products.

00:52.683 --> 00:58.369
XXX: full of antioxidants when I need to make love to the camera.
