00:00.355 --> 00:01.351
ï»¿Where are you, Ralph?

00:01.812 --> 00:03.856
We'll be late for soccer practice, hurry!

00:04.558 --> 00:05.407
Sorry, Larry.

00:05.926 --> 00:08.058
I can't find the ball and my soccer gear.

00:09.099 --> 00:09.665
I see.

00:10.303 --> 00:12.794
We still have thirty-three minutes before practice.

00:13.591 --> 00:15.631
We'll run some drills according to Coach Carl.

00:16.442 --> 00:19.033
Weren't you looking forward to doing this last Thursday?

00:20.123 --> 00:20.780
I was.

00:21.369 --> 00:26.246
We'll be doing dribbling, long passes and a short field penalty box game.

00:26.733 --> 00:30.328
Coach also wants us to practice on trapping and ball control.

00:30.900 --> 00:31.453
Really?

00:31.969 --> 00:35.819
We rarely practice drills on Thursdays but I guess it's for the better.

00:37.453 --> 00:37.843
Right.

00:38.650 --> 00:41.864
Then on Saturday, we'll do recovery runs...

00:42.085 --> 00:45.649
...and practice striking long and close-range shots.

00:46.707 --> 00:47.867
Hmm, interesting.

00:48.604 --> 00:51.089
All right, I'll be waiting for you at the bleachers.

00:51.650 --> 00:54.037
Hurry up if you don't want to run laps around the field.

00:54.849 --> 00:55.629
Don't worry.

00:55.985 --> 00:57.391
I'll be right over quickly.
