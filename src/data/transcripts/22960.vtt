00:00.766 --> 00:03.465
Our world is facing an unstoppable threat.

00:04.962 --> 00:06.213
We can't do this alone.

00:06.567 --> 00:07.893
I know someone who can help.

00:09.113 --> 00:11.344
They call themselves the Guardians of the Galaxy.

00:13.124 --> 00:14.563
They're a band of mercenaries.

00:15.447 --> 00:16.581
The best in the business.

00:16.875 --> 00:21.549
12 billion people are depending on criminals, misfits and thugs?

00:21.621 --> 00:23.819
That's some of the nicer things I've heard said about them.

00:26.315 --> 00:28.195
So here we are, whether we like it or not,...

00:28.699 --> 00:30.308
...we're the only ones who can stop this.

00:30.402 --> 00:32.063
Why would you wanna save the galaxy?

00:32.263 --> 00:33.819
'Cause I'm one of the idiots who lives in it!

00:33.916 --> 00:34.596
Oh!

00:37.202 --> 00:37.921
That's a big gun.

00:38.075 --> 00:39.635
Oh, yeah.

00:48.803 --> 00:49.591
I have a plan.

00:49.738 --> 00:50.492
You've got a plan?

00:50.591 --> 00:52.687
I have part of a plan.

00:54.311 --> 00:55.116
That's a fake laugh.

00:55.199 --> 00:56.078
It's real!

00:57.697 --> 00:59.025
Guardians of the Galaxy.
