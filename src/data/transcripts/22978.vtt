ï»¿Go, go, go!

00:21.817 --> 00:22.826
Great to have you back.

00:23.075 --> 00:24.395
No better place to be.

00:29.467 --> 00:30.081
He can't be.

00:32.766 --> 00:33.824
We were close once.

00:34.005 --> 00:37.927
We started this whole expendables thing together but we had a falling-out.

00:41.756 --> 00:42.429
What are you gonna do?

00:43.053 --> 00:43.777
Reload.

00:47.419 --> 00:48.878
Welcome to the 21st century.

00:51.079 --> 00:51.639
I could do that.

00:53.351 --> 00:54.779
Wanna slip on a dress and give it a shot?

00:56.499 --> 00:56.996
This is it?

00:57.398 --> 00:58.193
This is your team?

00:59.969 --> 01:00.835
Short notice.

01:01.565 --> 01:02.591
Yeah, very short.

01:11.811 --> 01:12.771
What the hell is that?

01:20.544 --> 01:21.379
Darn it, Barney!

01:21.574 --> 01:22.978
You should've killed me when you had the chance.

01:24.718 --> 01:25.473
You wanted the kids?

01:25.953 --> 01:26.489
Come get them.

01:31.009 --> 01:34.040
You were stupid enough to get yourself into this mess!

01:34.849 --> 01:37.413
We're the only ones crazy enough to get you out of it!

01:44.412 --> 01:45.315
Didn't take the stairs?

01:50.069 --> 01:51.715
How hard can it be to kill ten men?

01:56.240 --> 01:56.963
Insane.

01:57.197 --> 01:59.209
Courageous but insane.

02:05.095 --> 02:06.515
These guys are nuts.
