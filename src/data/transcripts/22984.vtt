ï»¿Visitors from around the world...

00:02.427 --> 00:05.513
...paid their respects along this section of Hollywood Boulevard...

00:05.795 --> 00:10.556
...which is lined with sidewalk plaques to the major stars, including Robin Williams.

00:10.883 --> 00:15.182
One found the news hard to believe Monday, after a friend sent a message.

00:15.363 --> 00:17.789
My reaction was like, "This has to be a joke."

00:18.318 --> 00:20.057
"It has to be a joke, no way."

00:20.436 --> 00:24.511
As the news sank in, fans looked back on the actor's varied career,...

00:24.697 --> 00:26.377
...including Melinda Martinez.

00:26.474 --> 00:30.642
He was just an amazing actor and comedian and I'm very touched,...

00:30.719 --> 00:33.673
...and I was very saddened yesterday like probably the whole world.

00:34.013 --> 00:36.721
Williams rose to fame more than 30 years ago.

00:37.065 --> 00:40.794
Many fans grow up with Williams' work like Daniel Hammond of New Zealand.

00:41.234 --> 00:44.471
He was a big part of my childhood, I think, growing up,...

00:44.639 --> 00:49.603
...a lot of the movies like silly kind of kids' movies, "Jumanji" and things...

00:49.687 --> 00:54.807
...were a big part of my childhood and it's really sad to see him go.

00:55.223 --> 00:59.892
Charlene Houdashell, a visitor from Texas, loved the comic's upbeat humor.

01:00.245 --> 01:02.226
He always seemed to be able to make everybody else laugh...

01:02.499 --> 01:05.359
...and forget about whatever problems they had in their life.

01:05.811 --> 01:08.645
Others like John Linville loved his spontaneity.

01:09.081 --> 01:10.712
He's off-the-cuff, he's very quick.

01:10.861 --> 01:11.671
He's quick with it.

01:12.931 --> 01:15.262
You know, he can come up with ideas very, very fast.

01:15.673 --> 01:18.275
The actor won an Oscar for a serious role.

01:18.417 --> 01:20.050
Robin Williams in "Good Will Hunting."

01:20.674 --> 01:26.125
Some fans prefer the actor's many comic roles, including German visitor Angelique Hoffman.

01:26.320 --> 01:31.625
Because I think that there are less actors who can brighten up the day...

01:31.697 --> 01:36.248
...and make movies that kind of special that people remember it.

01:36.666 --> 01:39.969
These fans say Robin Williams will be remembered as an actor...

01:40.151 --> 01:43.286
...who brought laughter and entertainment to millions of people.

01:43.743 --> 01:46.787
