00:00.445 --> 00:02.921
ï»¿I was brought up in the Betty Crocker era.

00:03.061 --> 00:05.225
You had to get married and you had to have a child.

00:06.247 --> 00:08.683
That's what it was about, to meet the guy,...

00:08.886 --> 00:12.411
...to get married, to have babies, to be the president of the PTA.

00:12.509 --> 00:14.778
Every place I went for interviews,...

00:14.866 --> 00:17.294
...the only thing they wanted to know was, "Can you type?"

00:17.630 --> 00:20.579
Your high score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test...

00:20.730 --> 00:23.102
...indicates that you can become a good secretary.

00:29.292 --> 00:35.397
It was as if a great floodlight had gone on and it illuminated everything.

00:36.797 --> 00:41.167
We were so idealistic, we were so energetic, we were so in-your-face...

00:41.269 --> 00:42.701
...and there were so many of us!

00:43.547 --> 00:45.559
We had to change the system.

00:46.039 --> 00:48.727
Everything in the workplace, everything in the political sphere,...

00:48.832 --> 00:50.213
...everything in the domestic sphere.

00:50.451 --> 00:55.009
What we are talking about is a revolution and not a reform.

00:55.281 --> 00:56.707
It was exhilarating!

00:57.093 --> 01:01.109
It was also somewhat torturing because we were breaking new ground.

01:01.918 --> 01:03.590
Our message was "Family!"

01:04.227 --> 01:06.607
Appreciate the woman, appreciate the mother...

01:07.469 --> 01:10.705
...and her role in developing the next generation.

01:11.415 --> 01:16.205
Somehow you end up doing all the laundry and 90 percent of the grocery shopping.

01:16.304 --> 01:20.241
We need to live in a world where men do half, women let them do half...

01:20.593 --> 01:24.173
...and being a parent is not a full-time job for a woman and a part-time job for a man.

01:25.489 --> 01:30.558
What women were looking for is not that guarantee that they would succeed...

01:30.913 --> 01:33.790
...but at least the opportunity to try.
