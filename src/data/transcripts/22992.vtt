00:00.877 --> 00:05.051
I consider Paige like a long-lost sister that I never had that I should have had.

00:06.111 --> 00:10.014
The crazy thing is, me and Paige have been so close but we actually have never met.

00:14.687 --> 00:16.066
My mom was pregnant with me...

00:16.206 --> 00:19.739
...and just found out that I had one arm at 20 weeks, I think.

00:20.009 --> 00:23.460
She wanted to find someone else that was experiencing the same thing.

00:23.616 --> 00:26.893
So she went on a website and found Teresa and Paige.

00:27.427 --> 00:28.643
When me and Sarah were born,...

00:28.715 --> 00:31.417
...our parents were sending letters and pictures to each other and stuff,...

00:31.576 --> 00:32.783
...so they became close.

00:33.863 --> 00:37.316
When I first saw Paige, it was like I'd seen a mirror image of me.

00:37.637 --> 00:40.944
When I saw Sarah, it was kind of like oh, this is how people see me.

00:41.491 --> 00:45.196
We'd talk about boys and life, and compare things.

00:45.321 --> 00:47.397
She doesn't really worry about what other people think about her.

00:47.514 --> 00:49.708
She can walk around happily in a short sleeve top.

00:51.767 --> 00:53.895
She helped me a lot and gave me a lot of confidence.

00:54.146 --> 00:57.763
I could tell Sarah things that I wouldn't be able to tell my friends.

00:58.239 --> 00:59.651
I trust her with my life.

01:03.017 --> 01:06.039
We have been so close for eight years...

01:06.365 --> 01:08.305
...but thousands of miles away from each other.

01:08.809 --> 01:10.193
We definitely wouldn't be very close...

01:10.267 --> 01:12.855
...if it wasn't for Skype and how it's brought us together.

01:14.111 --> 01:15.537
Some best friends come and go.

01:15.938 --> 01:18.391
I feel like Paige will always be my best friend no matter what.

01:19.116 --> 01:21.427
It's crazy that we've never met.

01:21.709 --> 01:24.665
We've always dreamed of it, but it's just never happened yet.

01:25.057 --> 01:26.191
I can't believe it.

01:27.667 --> 01:28.879
It doesn't seem real.

01:39.141 --> 01:40.200
You're so beautiful!

01:40.807 --> 01:41.408
So are you!

01:42.984 --> 01:45.001
I'm sure we'll always find time for each other...

01:45.073 --> 01:47.953
...because it's one of those friendships that you don't find twice.

01:48.987 --> 01:52.351
We're like two needles in a haystack that just found each other.
