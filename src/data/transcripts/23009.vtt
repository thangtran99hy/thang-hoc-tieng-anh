I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history...

00:19.092 --> 00:24.787
...as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.

00:28.939 --> 00:39.357
Five score years ago a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today...

00:40.581 --> 00:44.627
...signed the Emancipation Proclamation.

00:46.315 --> 00:52.124
This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope...

00:52.227 --> 01:00.531
...to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice.

01:01.959 --> 01:10.270
It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.

01:12.177 --> 01:21.486
But 100 years later, the Negro still is not free.

01:22.623 --> 01:24.735
100 years later,...

01:26.374 --> 01:33.122
...the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation...

01:33.873 --> 01:36.725
...and the chains of discrimination.

01:37.236 --> 01:44.297
100 years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty...

01:45.280 --> 01:49.724
...in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.

01:49.910 --> 02:01.977
100 years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society...

02:02.431 --> 02:06.591
...and finds himself an exile in his own land.

02:07.297 --> 02:13.959
And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.

02:15.169 --> 02:20.068
In a sense, we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check.

02:20.905 --> 02:28.161
When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the constitution...

02:28.260 --> 02:30.542
...and the Declaration of Independence,...

02:31.881 --> 02:38.943
...they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.

02:40.591 --> 02:43.385
This note was a promise that all men,...

02:44.473 --> 02:47.893
...yes black men as well as white men,...

02:48.859 --> 02:56.603
...would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
