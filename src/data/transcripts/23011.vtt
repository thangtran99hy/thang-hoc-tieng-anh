00:00.434 --> 00:02.321
And after I dump this bucket of ice on my head,...

00:02.383 --> 00:04.848
...I get to nominate three new people to challenge.

00:05.311 --> 00:09.357
So I'm gonna challenge Bill Gates, my partner at Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg,...

00:09.467 --> 00:12.308
...and Netflix's founder and CEO, Reed Hastings.

00:17.695 --> 00:19.182
I'm glad to give to ALS.

00:19.519 --> 00:21.758
It's a great cause, but I wanna accept this challenge.

00:21.834 --> 00:25.452
I wanna do it better than it's been done.

00:26.294 --> 00:27.775
I've been working on this.

00:28.643 --> 00:30.069
I got this design.

00:30.826 --> 00:32.589
There we go, yeah.

00:34.003 --> 00:34.755
It's gonna be great.

00:35.911 --> 00:40.469
I'm here to join the people bringing attention to Lou Gehrig's disease...

00:40.643 --> 00:44.265
...by taking the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.

00:45.214 --> 00:46.945
I'm gonna challenge three more people.

00:47.632 --> 00:54.085
Elon Musk, Ryan Seacrest and Chris Anderson of TED, consider yourself challenged.

00:54.643 --> 00:56.966
You have 24 hours.

00:57.653 --> 00:58.283
Good luck.
