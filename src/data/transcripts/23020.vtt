We don't read and write poetry because it's cute.

00:15.145 --> 00:19.156
We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race,...

00:19.495 --> 00:22.631
...and the human race is filled with passion.

00:25.397 --> 00:27.415
Medicine, law, business, engineering,...

00:27.739 --> 00:30.401
...these are noble pursuits necessary to sustain life,...

00:32.520 --> 00:41.451
...but poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.

00:47.831 --> 00:48.627
To quote from Whitman,...

00:48.925 --> 00:53.089
..."O me, o life, of the questions of these recurring,...

00:54.899 --> 00:57.204
...of the endless trains of the faithless,...

00:57.590 --> 00:59.383
...of cities filled with the foolish.

01:00.609 --> 01:03.345
What good amid these, O me, O life?"

01:04.240 --> 01:10.444
Answer: "That you are here, that life exists, and identity;...

01:12.309 --> 01:16.005
...that the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse;...

01:19.934 --> 01:25.246
...that the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse."

01:27.067 --> 01:28.231
What will your verse be?
