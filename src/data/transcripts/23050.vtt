00:00.128 --> 00:04.129
Born in 1890, Hendrikje van Andel-Schipper was in remarkable health...

00:04.235 --> 00:07.719
...until she died in 2005 at age 115.

00:08.205 --> 00:10.307
She then donated her body to scientists...

00:10.453 --> 00:13.704
...who looked deep into her blood to learn the secrets of her longevity.

00:14.183 --> 00:18.742
Researchers found that much comes down to stem cells and their ability to replenish tissues.

00:19.004 --> 00:22.493
When they wear down with age, becoming less long-lived and productive,...

00:22.727 --> 00:25.831
...we lose the ability to regenerate blood and vital cells.

00:26.250 --> 00:29.920
Our cells can only replicate themselves for so long before they burn out.

00:30.262 --> 00:32.056
And by the time van Andel-Schipper died,...

00:32.400 --> 00:35.969
...two-thirds of her white blood cells originated from just two stem cells,...

00:36.355 --> 00:40.591
...suggesting nearly all the blood stem cells she was born with had worn out and died.

00:41.077 --> 00:45.343
The research shows that genetic and biological factors trounce lifestyle factors...

00:45.460 --> 00:47.325
...when it comes to supercentenarians.

00:47.539 --> 00:51.215
And of course, it points to the potential of reviving bodies in decline...

00:51.335 --> 00:53.658
...with injections of stem cells saved from birth,...

00:53.949 --> 00:56.782
...which cautious researchers said is a real possibility.
