Natto is a traditional Japanese food made from fermented soybeans.

00:04.118 --> 00:06.022
Studies have indicated vast health benefits...

00:06.135 --> 00:08.488
...from the consumption of this unique breakfast dish.

00:09.458 --> 00:09.816
Okay.

00:10.419 --> 00:10.695
Alright.

00:10.771 --> 00:11.483
It looks innocent.

00:11.579 --> 00:12.354
Is it bugs?

00:13.759 --> 00:15.365
Oh, gross!

00:16.072 --> 00:17.337
I hope that's cheese.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.267
Oh, it does not taste good.

00:21.391 --> 00:22.773
This tastes like rotten beans.

00:22.859 --> 00:24.040
Bitter, definitely.

00:24.180 --> 00:24.783
Peanut poop.

00:24.885 --> 00:27.049
And it tastes like it's fermented, but it's not bad.

00:27.156 --> 00:30.625
I cannot possibly say enough horrible things about it.

00:30.815 --> 00:33.605
Many Southeast Asians regard durian as the king of fruits.

00:33.780 --> 00:35.950
Its most distinctive feature is its powerful aroma,...

00:36.049 --> 00:39.077
...making it a difficult delicacy to find in stores and restaurants.

00:44.590 --> 00:45.857
Oh my god!

00:45.925 --> 00:47.447
It smells like rotten fruit.

00:47.517 --> 00:48.045
So we're done, right?

00:48.133 --> 00:49.959
We don't have to eat it, we've smelled it, so we're good.

00:50.075 --> 00:51.442
It's the same color as this tablecloth.

00:51.549 --> 00:53.292
This is not a pretty tablecloth.

00:53.436 --> 00:53.922
To the left.

00:54.033 --> 00:54.785
To the left!

00:55.235 --> 00:56.739
Oh god, he doesn't like it.

00:56.899 --> 00:57.815
Now I'm scared.

00:57.932 --> 00:59.149
It tastes good, right?

00:59.571 --> 00:59.803
No.

00:59.913 --> 01:02.183
The taste is not as bad as the smell,...

01:02.371 --> 01:04.231
...but it is not a good taste.

01:04.301 --> 01:05.656
I'm telling you, it's mango mixed with garlic.

01:05.862 --> 01:06.952
I like mango and I like garlic.
