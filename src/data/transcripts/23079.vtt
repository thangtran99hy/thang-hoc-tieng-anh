For a sexy dinner date, turn up the volume with your look.

00:04.051 --> 00:05.661
Let your eyes do all the talking.

00:09.105 --> 00:11.066
Start out with the taupe eye shadow color...

00:11.335 --> 00:14.302
...and add this on your lids to neutralize your eyes.

00:18.123 --> 00:22.787
Next step: select this vanilla shade and cover your entire lids with this color.

00:25.569 --> 00:27.478
Select the taupe eye shadow color again...

00:27.952 --> 00:31.446
...and use this to contour your lids to add more definition to your eyes.

00:35.611 --> 00:39.353
Now with the matte dark cocoa bean color, use this to line your eyes.

00:39.551 --> 00:42.507
You wanna make little dash marks and connect the lines together...

00:42.823 --> 00:44.449
...to create one continuous line.

00:46.493 --> 00:48.290
Select the darkest color in your palette...

00:48.691 --> 00:50.725
...and start around the outer third of your eyes,...

00:51.106 --> 00:54.203
...build up the intensity to create the sexy smoldering shape.

01:00.294 --> 01:02.297
Take this antique silver eye shadow color...

01:02.760 --> 01:05.291
...and use it to highlight the inner corners of your eyes.

01:05.668 --> 01:07.612
This will help bring more brightness to your eyes.

01:10.393 --> 01:14.526
With the darkest color again, lightly brush this along the lower lash line...

01:14.857 --> 01:16.585
...and then connect with the top lid.

01:16.997 --> 01:18.893
And now, just even out both eyes.
