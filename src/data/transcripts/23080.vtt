So when they're in that vulnerable time between ten and twelve,...

00:04.633 --> 00:08.777
...how do you think it affects them when somebody uses "like a girl" as an insult?

00:08.951 --> 00:13.975
I think it definitely drops their self-confidence and really puts them down...

00:14.364 --> 00:17.996
...because during that time, they're already trying to figure themselves out.

00:18.513 --> 00:21.421
And when somebody says, "You hit like a girl",...

00:22.215 --> 00:24.112
...it's like, well, what does that mean?

00:24.269 --> 00:26.943
'Cause they think they're a strong person.

00:27.281 --> 00:30.901
It's kind of like telling them that they're weak and they're not as good as them.

00:31.489 --> 00:35.778
And what advice do you have to young girls who are told...

00:35.985 --> 00:37.827
...they run like a girl, kick like a girl,...

00:37.917 --> 00:39.411
...hit like a girl, swim like a girl?

00:40.544 --> 00:41.975
Keep doing it 'cause it's working.

00:42.719 --> 00:44.727
If somebody else says that running like a girl...

00:44.833 --> 00:47.265
...or kicking like a girl or shooting like a girl....

00:47.644 --> 00:49.849
...is something that you shouldn't be doing, that's their problem.

00:50.200 --> 00:53.152
Because if you're still scoring and you're still getting to the ball in time...

00:53.434 --> 00:56.466
...and you're still being first, you're doing it right.

00:56.599 --> 00:57.573
It doesn't matter what they say.

00:57.741 --> 01:01.263
I mean, yes, I kick like a girl and I swim like a girl...

01:01.757 --> 01:03.798
...and I walk like a girl and I wake up in the morning like a girl...

01:04.000 --> 01:04.783
...because I am a girl.

01:05.234 --> 01:08.245
And that is not something that I should be ashamed of,...

01:08.443 --> 01:09.607
...so I'm gonna do it anyway.

01:17.421 --> 01:20.101
Why can't "run like a girl" also mean "win the race"?
