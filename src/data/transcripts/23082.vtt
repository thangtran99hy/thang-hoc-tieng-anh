The reading program is a community outreach program.

00:03.385 --> 00:06.945
It enables children in our community to come in, read to the cats,...

00:07.123 --> 00:11.310
...earn prizes and spend some extra loving on our cats here at the shelter.

00:11.638 --> 00:15.470
It helps improve the children's reading skills as well as their self-esteem.

00:15.879 --> 00:21.291
I'm reading Bruce and Juliet, the dragon story.

00:21.873 --> 00:24.553
I'm reading to some of the cats.

00:25.467 --> 00:30.764
And before the one cat went up there and was just sitting there...

00:31.390 --> 00:34.521
...and I was reading and it was staring at me.

00:35.367 --> 00:39.674
I like coming here because my favorite type of animal is cats,...

00:39.780 --> 00:42.632
...big cats, small cats, medium cats.

00:45.240 --> 00:50.908
My favorite type of cat is a tiger and I have a Siamese.

00:51.290 --> 00:54.007
I've been getting e-mails and phone calls from parents,...

00:54.145 --> 00:57.151
...thanking us for having this program at the shelter.

00:57.259 --> 00:59.757
It's improved their children's skills at school.

00:59.919 --> 01:02.372
It's boosted their self-esteem through the roof.

01:02.473 --> 01:04.258
So it's been well received all around.
