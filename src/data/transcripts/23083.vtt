Imagine you're at a football game when this obnoxious guy sits next to you.

00:11.103 --> 00:14.694
He's loud, he spills his drink on you and he makes fun of your team.

00:15.123 --> 00:19.397
Days later, you're walking in the park, when suddenly it starts to pour rain.

00:19.931 --> 00:22.271
Who should show up at your side to offer you an umbrella?

00:22.427 --> 00:24.426
The same guy from the football game.

00:25.003 --> 00:28.037
Do you change your mind about him based on this second encounter...

00:28.304 --> 00:30.871
...or do you go with your first impression and write him off?

00:31.943 --> 00:34.617
Research in social psychology suggests that...

00:34.699 --> 00:38.485
...we're quick to form lasting impressions of others based on their behaviors.

00:39.031 --> 00:41.086
We manage to do this with little effort,...

00:41.324 --> 00:44.459
...inferring stable character traits from a single behavior...

00:44.647 --> 00:46.589
...like a harsh word or a clumsy step.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.704
Using our impressions as guides,...

00:48.903 --> 00:52.323
...we can accurately predict how people are going to behave in the future.

00:53.307 --> 00:55.371
Armed with the knowledge the guy from the football game...

00:55.470 --> 00:57.042
...was a jerk the first time you met him,...

00:57.363 --> 00:59.586
...you might expect more of the same down the road.

00:59.887 --> 01:02.511
If so, you might choose to avoid him the next time you see him.

01:03.055 --> 01:06.988
That said, we can change our impressions in light of new information.

01:07.750 --> 01:11.000
Behavioral researchers have identified consistent patterns...

01:11.209 --> 01:14.516
...that seem to guide this process of impression updating.

01:15.134 --> 01:19.675
On one hand, learning very negative, highly immoral information about someone...

01:19.941 --> 01:21.707
...typically has a stronger impact...

01:21.883 --> 01:24.905
...than learning very positive, highly moral information.

01:25.543 --> 01:28.665
So, unfortunately for our new friend from the football game,...

01:28.813 --> 01:32.892
...his bad behavior at the game might outweigh his good behavior at the park.

01:33.227 --> 01:37.289
Research suggests that this bias occurs because immoral behaviors...

01:37.555 --> 01:41.697
...are more diagnostic or revealing of a person's true character.
