ï»¿Dear kitten, since I have hissed at you the customary 437 times,...

00:08.293 --> 00:13.243
...it is now my duty as the head of the household to begrudgingly welcome you.

00:13.505 --> 00:15.209
Perhaps you are here to replace me...

00:15.403 --> 00:19.515
...but I must do my duty and educate you on your new surroundings...

00:19.807 --> 00:23.309
...as Maximillian once did for me, rest in peace.

00:23.507 --> 00:27.430
Dear kitten, you should be aware that there are two kinds of food.

00:27.636 --> 00:30.918
The first is sort of a dehydrated brown nibblet.

00:31.219 --> 00:35.154
I think they give us these because they are training us to be astronauts.

00:35.465 --> 00:36.151
Just a guess.

00:36.335 --> 00:38.099
The second kind is wet food.

00:38.361 --> 00:43.725
It is so special they keep it in little armored metal casings that no claw can penetrate.

00:43.855 --> 00:47.636
Dear kitten, I should warn you of the monster known as Vacuum.

00:47.783 --> 00:50.746
It can eat and yell at the same time.

00:51.075 --> 00:55.268
To hide from Vacuum, you may use the curtains of invisibility.

00:56.849 --> 00:58.271
Oh yeah, you're good.

00:58.579 --> 00:59.283
Good hiding.

00:59.746 --> 01:00.341
Oh boy.

01:00.543 --> 01:02.760
Dear kitten, one final note.

01:03.069 --> 01:06.154
Once in a while, you might see a little red dot.

01:06.304 --> 01:07.929
I'm going to tell you this right now:...

01:08.475 --> 01:11.050
...it is real and it can be caught.

01:11.489 --> 01:12.344
I did it once.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.044
I held it for a full minute.

01:14.354 --> 01:16.917
But when I lifted my paws, it was gone.

01:17.872 --> 01:20.699
So kitten, welcome to the household.

01:22.508 --> 01:23.615
You'll do just fine.
