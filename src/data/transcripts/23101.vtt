00:00.385 --> 00:02.881
Over time, the amount of energy humans use has increased.

00:02.963 --> 00:05.965
This is happening because there are more and more people that need energy...

00:06.049 --> 00:09.333
...to power their cars, TVs and lots of other stuff.

00:10.053 --> 00:13.323
The energy sources we use emit gases called greenhouse gases.

00:13.443 --> 00:15.985
Like a greenhouse traps heat to keep plants warm,...

00:16.153 --> 00:19.121
...greenhouse gases trap heat from the sun to keep us warm.

00:19.299 --> 00:22.569
Too much of this can cause the Earth some big problems.

00:22.931 --> 00:24.165
When the sun heats the Earth,....

00:24.352 --> 00:27.855
....that heat is trapped in greenhouse gases, which are in the atmosphere.

00:28.459 --> 00:30.465
These greenhouse gases keep the Earth warm.

00:30.689 --> 00:32.959
But too many of them and the Earth can't cool.

00:33.372 --> 00:36.603
You might ask, "Can we fix it?" or "Can we help?"

00:37.973 --> 00:39.200
Yes, you can.

00:39.579 --> 00:44.025
Make sure to recycle and just do all around good environmental things for the Earth.
