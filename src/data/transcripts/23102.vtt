ï»¿What I love the most about reading is that it helps you think for yourself...

00:05.384 --> 00:09.638
...and create characters and places and ideas for yourself.

00:09.796 --> 00:13.949
She's trying to see if Mr. Todd is going to be in love.

00:15.392 --> 00:17.711
And to make potions to make her in love.

00:18.183 --> 00:19.593
So what are you reading?

00:19.933 --> 00:21.692
Lovable characters.

00:21.780 --> 00:24.535
You need lovable characters to tell the story.

00:24.723 --> 00:26.164
It's fun to read.
