00:03.336 --> 00:04.860
This is about us.

00:06.495 --> 00:07.017
All of us.

00:08.607 --> 00:11.461
Right now, a couple billion of us have access to the Internet...

00:12.327 --> 00:13.764
...and amazing things have come from it.

00:15.821 --> 00:17.937
So what happens when the rest of us get access?

00:19.670 --> 00:20.919
It doesn't get twice as good.

00:21.766 --> 00:23.959
It gets like a bazillion times as good.

00:25.133 --> 00:29.625
Imagine it, for the first time in history, humanity firing on all cylinders.

00:30.591 --> 00:32.296
Everyone, everywhere.

00:33.869 --> 00:38.105
New voices, new dreams, new inspirations.

00:39.585 --> 00:41.855
And here's the thing: we can do it.

00:43.877 --> 00:48.472
It starts up here at 60,000 feet with planes powered by the sun,...

00:48.881 --> 00:50.757
...opening up the Internet to people everywhere.

00:53.262 --> 00:55.563
So what happens now when we all have the Internet?

00:58.761 --> 00:59.823
That falls to us.

01:02.213 --> 01:02.777
All of us.
