It's called GRE / SAT Vocab Lock.

00:03.927 --> 00:06.718
This is an Android app and it's available in the Google Play Store...

00:06.905 --> 00:10.245
...that lets you learn a new word every time you unlock your phone.

00:10.649 --> 00:14.478
A normal person will unlock their smartphone over 100 times a day.

00:14.576 --> 00:15.291
That's a lot!

00:15.651 --> 00:19.102
So what if you could use that time to learn a new vocabulary word?

00:19.611 --> 00:22.387
This app will make you learn up to 20 different words a day.

00:22.836 --> 00:26.187
You will receive a word and you have to drag it over to its synonym.

00:26.545 --> 00:30.584
If you get it right, it turns green and if you get it wrong, it turns red.

00:31.024 --> 00:31.927
If you don't have a clue,...

00:32.037 --> 00:35.384
...you can drag the word to the little "d," which stands for "define."

00:35.850 --> 00:38.949
GRE / SAT Vocab Lock will repeat the same word...

00:39.047 --> 00:41.141
...until the app feels that you've learned that word.

00:41.504 --> 00:46.332
Today, I learned the word "sanguine," which means "cheerfully optimistic" or "happy."
