00:00.043 --> 00:04.545
Despite being huge and having the ability to open canned goods,...

00:04.679 --> 00:09.379
...humans are frail in both body and mind and we must care for them.

00:11.204 --> 00:13.685
Perhaps from ennui or a malaise,...

00:13.767 --> 00:18.155
...humans often stare at random inanimate objects for hours at a time.

00:18.507 --> 00:20.903
Your duty is to break this spell...

00:21.059 --> 00:23.967
...to remind them that there is life out there to live.

00:24.188 --> 00:28.231
Perhaps the worst offender of these objects is the light box.

00:28.505 --> 00:31.565
You must remind them that boxes don't need light.

00:31.787 --> 00:34.525
You just need the light of your imagination.

00:34.719 --> 00:35.660
See what I did there?

00:36.420 --> 00:38.569
Look, I'm an astronaut now.

00:38.832 --> 00:42.337
And now I'm a rocket ship and the box is the astronaut.

00:42.675 --> 00:44.489
I just blew your mind.

00:45.009 --> 00:49.226
They insist on using water bowls that are too narrow for their heads,...

00:49.770 --> 00:53.019
...which means they cannot drink in the civilized fashion:...

00:53.235 --> 00:55.177
...with your face and your tongue.

00:55.569 --> 00:59.558
Speaking of tongues, humans don't seem to use theirs for anything.

00:59.681 --> 01:01.424
You must lick them every morning,...

01:01.577 --> 01:04.713
...and remind them that a tongue is a terrible thing to waste.

01:05.162 --> 01:07.243
I have no clue how they keep clean.

01:08.331 --> 01:10.888
Besides that cute little tuft on their heads,...

01:11.061 --> 01:14.396
...humans are, for the most part, sadly, hairless.

01:14.771 --> 01:18.419
During the day, they cover themselves with little body blankets.

01:19.053 --> 01:23.042
You must donate your fur to these articles whenever possible.

01:23.784 --> 01:28.796
Each night, you must curl up on their faces or they will freeze to death.

01:29.460 --> 01:33.533
For all of this we only ask the occasional help opening cans,...

01:33.659 --> 01:36.283
...and a clean place to do our kitty business.
