When I started the project,...

00:02.033 --> 00:05.282
...I started thinking about how we could actually automate the process.

00:11.466 --> 00:12.851
There are a variety of ways you can automate.

00:12.941 --> 00:15.729
You could buy a very, very expensive kit off the shelf,...

00:15.931 --> 00:17.994
...but Legos seemed like the simplest way.

00:19.124 --> 00:21.897
The great thing about the robots is that once you tell them what to do,...

00:22.103 --> 00:25.039
...they can just do it very precisely over and over again.

00:25.195 --> 00:30.168
So a day later, I can come back and see a fully made sample.

00:34.629 --> 00:35.840
Research is a funny thing...

00:35.956 --> 00:39.630
...because you might think that we order everything up out of scientific catalogs,...

00:39.733 --> 00:43.548
...but actually, a lot of the things that we use around the lab are household items,...

00:43.634 --> 00:46.407
...things we've picked up at the local home goods store.

00:46.487 --> 00:49.806
And so, our robots just fit in with that mindset.

00:51.299 --> 00:54.393
The importance in its science is the creativity and going forward,...

00:54.473 --> 00:57.371
...it's not exactly what tools you used to get there.
