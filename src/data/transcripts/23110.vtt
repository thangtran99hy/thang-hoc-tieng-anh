Death sucks!

00:04.733 --> 00:07.533
But what happens to your body after you die is fascinating,...

00:07.998 --> 00:09.200
...so we're going to show you.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.596
Don't worry, it won't be gross, much.

00:12.487 --> 00:16.590
Once a person's breathing stops, the cells in their body stop receiving oxygen,...

00:17.024 --> 00:20.971
...but the cells continue to live for several minutes, generating carbon dioxide.

00:21.251 --> 00:26.208
Carbon dioxide is acidic and it builds up, rupturing sacs inside the cells.

00:27.025 --> 00:31.982
These sacs contain enzymes that begin to digest the cells from the inside out.

00:32.333 --> 00:35.526
This creates a blister-like fluid rich in nutrients.

00:35.917 --> 00:39.895
After about a week, those nutrients fuel an army of bacteria and fungi...

00:39.985 --> 00:42.353
...that further liquefy organs and muscles.

00:42.817 --> 00:44.402
The microbes that attack the tissue...

00:44.527 --> 00:48.040
...produce a bewildering array of more than 400 chemicals and gases.

00:48.305 --> 00:52.028
They include Freon, that's right, the coolant found in refrigerators;...

00:52.253 --> 00:54.821
...benzene, a powerful component in gasoline;...

00:55.291 --> 00:58.142
...sulfur, which smells of swamps and rotten eggs;...

00:58.661 --> 01:01.513
...and a molecule known as "carbon tetrachloride,"...

01:01.935 --> 01:04.501
...which was used in fire extinguishers and dry cleaning...

01:04.589 --> 01:06.943
...until scientists discovered it's highly toxic.

01:07.184 --> 01:09.121
At this point, there's very little flesh left...

01:09.229 --> 01:13.531
...and it's consumed by, here it comes, maggots and beetles.

01:13.953 --> 01:16.205
Insects leave only bones behind.

01:17.524 --> 01:20.496
Over time, the protein in bone decomposes too,...

01:20.601 --> 01:23.795
...leaving just the bone mineral called hydroxyapatite,...

01:24.297 --> 01:25.897
...which eventually turns to dust.

01:26.838 --> 01:30.407
We can take some solace in the fact that all those nutrients and chemicals,...

01:30.491 --> 01:34.543
...even the dust, provide vital substances that make soils fertile,...

01:34.867 --> 01:38.738
...sprouting plants and other new life after our lives have ended.

01:40.263 --> 01:43.171
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
