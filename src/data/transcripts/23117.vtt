There's no denying that human babies are cute,...

00:02.641 --> 00:05.665
...but even other species tend to have adorable infants.

00:05.867 --> 00:09.443
So, why has science conditioned us to find babies so precious?

00:09.771 --> 00:13.047
Is there something specific that triggers our urge to hold and squeeze them?

00:13.451 --> 00:14.716
Interestingly, studies have found...

00:14.809 --> 00:17.526
...that macaque monkeys pay little attention to newborn faces,...

00:17.627 --> 00:21.355
...leading researchers to believe that the "cute feeling" may be an entirely human trait.

00:21.843 --> 00:23.062
Unlike many other species,...

00:23.205 --> 00:27.053
...once born, human babies are completely dependent on their parents for survival.

00:27.370 --> 00:29.728
As a result, humans have adapted to find certain traits...

00:29.833 --> 00:31.779
...aesthetically pleasing and downright adorable...

00:31.902 --> 00:35.315
...in an effort to increase interaction, care and protection from parents.

00:35.573 --> 00:39.479
This, in turn, enhances offspring survival and perpetuates our species.
