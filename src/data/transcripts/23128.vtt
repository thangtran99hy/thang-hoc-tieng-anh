I am not referring to the absolute, infinite concept of universal peace and goodwill...

00:09.348 --> 00:12.048
...of which some fantasies and fanatics dream.

00:13.998 --> 00:18.847
Let us focus instead on a more practical, more attainable peace.

00:20.167 --> 00:25.579
This will require a new effort, a new context for world discussions.

00:26.167 --> 00:28.185
It will require increased understanding...

00:28.551 --> 00:32.114
...and increased understanding will require increased contact.

00:33.560 --> 00:36.291
So let us not be blind to our differences...

00:37.041 --> 00:40.777
...but let us also direct attention to our common interests.

00:41.315 --> 00:47.059
Our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.

00:48.035 --> 00:49.566
We all breathe the same air.

00:50.327 --> 00:52.371
We all cherish our children's future.

00:53.075 --> 00:54.339
And we are all mortal.
