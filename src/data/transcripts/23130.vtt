00:01.027 --> 00:06.455
This is the human test: a test to see if you are a human.

00:07.498 --> 00:11.495
Please raise your hand if something applies to you.

00:11.991 --> 00:13.079
Are we agreed?

00:14.299 --> 00:14.959
Yes?

00:15.742 --> 00:16.772
Then let's begin.

00:17.629 --> 00:21.377
Have you ever purposely lowercased the first letter of a text...

00:21.801 --> 00:25.224
...in order to come across as sad or disappointed?

00:27.662 --> 00:28.712
Okay.

00:30.609 --> 00:35.030
Have you ever ended a text with a period as a sign of aggression?

00:36.183 --> 00:38.497
Okay, period.

00:39.472 --> 00:43.259
Have you ever seemed to lose your airplane ticket a thousand times...

00:43.331 --> 00:45.680
...as you walked from the check-in to the gate?

00:47.147 --> 00:48.217
Yes.

00:49.223 --> 00:53.178
Have you ever put on a pair of pants and then much later realized...

00:53.232 --> 00:56.298
...that there was a loose sock smooshed up against your thigh?

00:58.383 --> 00:59.013
Good.

01:00.698 --> 01:04.630
Have you ever tried to guess someone else's password so many times...

01:04.667 --> 01:06.111
...that it locked their account?

01:09.626 --> 01:14.614
Have you ever had a nagging feeling that one day you will be discovered as a fraud?

01:16.992 --> 01:18.681
Yes, it's safe here.

01:20.736 --> 01:24.392
Have you ever hoped that there was some ability you hadn't discovered yet...

01:24.614 --> 01:27.070
...that you were just naturally great at?

01:29.227 --> 01:33.858
Have you ever marveled at how someone you thought was so ordinary...

01:34.025 --> 01:36.301
...could suddenly become so beautiful?

01:38.602 --> 01:43.276
Have you ever stared at your phone smiling like an idiot while texting with someone?

01:45.912 --> 01:48.920
Have you ever subsequently texted that person the phrase...

01:49.402 --> 01:52.453
..."I'm staring at the phone smiling like an idiot."

01:54.868 --> 01:57.566
Have you ever woken up blissfully...

01:57.758 --> 02:01.888
...and suddenly been flooded by the awful remembrance that someone had left you?

02:03.794 --> 02:07.630
Have you ever lost the ability to imagine a future without a person...

02:08.119 --> 02:09.977
...that no longer was in your life?

02:13.029 --> 02:16.665
Have you ever looked back on that event with the sad smile of autumn...

02:16.937 --> 02:21.153
...and the realization that futures will happen regardless?

02:23.607 --> 02:24.785
Congratulations.

02:25.529 --> 02:27.128
You have now completed the test.

02:27.867 --> 02:29.072
You are all human.
