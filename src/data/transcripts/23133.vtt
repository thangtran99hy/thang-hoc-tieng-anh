ï»¿Karen Voght, founder and CEO of Wellness Incorporated...

00:03.624 --> 00:08.864
...and creator of the Alphabet Fitness program, gets kids on their feet to learn their ABCs.

00:09.201 --> 00:11.761
Being a literacy champion is an honor to me.

00:12.045 --> 00:15.486
What we see are children sitting more and more nowadays...

00:15.621 --> 00:19.377
...and little children in the age range that we're working with, three to six-year olds,...

00:19.773 --> 00:21.243
...they are designed to move.

00:21.333 --> 00:25.259
That's how they strengthen and develop their full body and their brains together.

00:25.858 --> 00:31.904
We just simply let them go and learn their ABCs by mimicking these 26 chimp letters...

00:32.229 --> 00:35.785
...and then starting to write the words together as a group.

00:39.214 --> 00:43.464
We have so much obesity and stress in our world...

00:43.747 --> 00:47.946
...that simply stretching their body when they're learning their ABCs....

00:48.313 --> 00:52.384
...reduces their stress levels and makes them receptive children.
