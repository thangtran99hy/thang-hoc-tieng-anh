00:00.041 --> 00:03.803
Curiosity is one of humankind's most beautiful traits.

00:04.027 --> 00:06.993
We want to know as much as possible about the world around us.

00:07.216 --> 00:10.253
But to satisfy our need to know about the world around us,...

00:10.491 --> 00:12.944
...our eyes just aren't good enough anymore.

00:13.354 --> 00:16.767
With the power of engineering, we have been able to take a look at worlds...

00:16.853 --> 00:20.927
...hidden inside and outside the narrow range of our human senses.

00:21.170 --> 00:25.927
We can take a look at the smallest life forms, our own cells and even molecules...

00:26.022 --> 00:27.793
...using electron microscopes.

00:28.229 --> 00:31.905
Complex machines that make invisible things visible,...

00:32.254 --> 00:37.665
...so we can discover worlds inside of worlds, inside of worlds, inside of worlds.

00:38.100 --> 00:42.771
Discoveries at the nanolevel have changed how we perceive the universe around us forever...

00:42.958 --> 00:45.184
...and led to countless discoveries.

00:45.448 --> 00:50.316
On the other hand, just a few centuries ago, engineers developed powerful tools of science...

00:50.420 --> 00:55.246
...that gave us the ability to look deep into space and spot countless wonders of the universe.

00:55.659 --> 00:58.287
Later came spacecraft and satellites.

00:58.633 --> 01:01.627
The Hubble Telescope was one of these wonders of technology.

01:02.021 --> 01:03.731
Without it, we would never have known...

01:03.830 --> 01:07.506
...that our galaxy is one of billions in an enormous universe.
