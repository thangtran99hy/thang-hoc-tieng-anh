The cognitive benefits of speaking a second language have been touted for years.

00:04.879 --> 00:08.195
But many monolingual adults think that their moment has passed.

00:08.591 --> 00:11.955
A new study in the analysis of neurology says it's not the case.

00:12.183 --> 00:18.573
Researchers studied 853 people who took an intelligence test in 1947 at age 11...

00:18.847 --> 00:21.446
...and then were tested again recently in their 70s.

00:21.715 --> 00:24.908
They found that bilingual speakers perform much better than expected...

00:25.197 --> 00:29.715
...on the later cognitive tasks given their scores on the 1947 test,...

00:30.067 --> 00:32.890
...and people who spoke three languages performed even better.

00:33.232 --> 00:34.963
That was true no matter their IQs...

00:35.127 --> 00:38.873
...or if the speakers had learned the languages before or after they were 18.

00:39.318 --> 00:42.195
Researchers concluded that learning an additional language...

00:42.313 --> 00:45.793
...may have brain benefits comparable to physical fitness and not smoking.
