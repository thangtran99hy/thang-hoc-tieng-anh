Kei, incredible match, congratulations.

00:03.375 --> 00:03.803
Thank you.

00:04.357 --> 00:08.023
Can you describe your emotions after this big win?

00:10.563 --> 00:11.939
I don't know what's going on.

00:13.626 --> 00:18.909
You know, I was a little bit tired, especially it was my first semifinal in a Grand Slam.

00:23.339 --> 00:27.154
Oh, it's just amazing, an amazing feeling, beating the number one player,...

00:27.242 --> 00:33.507
...and also playing much better than these couple of matches, I'm so happy.

00:34.082 --> 00:37.064
Well, your last few matches went the distance to five-set matches,...

00:37.559 --> 00:39.495
...it's hot today, the conditions are rough.

00:39.657 --> 00:41.327
How were you able to manage it to pull it off?

00:41.909 --> 00:45.021
Yeah, it was really a tough condition today, I always felt a little bit heavy,...

00:45.150 --> 00:49.665
...and humid too, but I guess I love to play long matches.

00:51.604 --> 00:54.021
I hope I can recover well for the final.

00:54.933 --> 00:57.588
How were you able to recover after losing the second set 6 - 1...

00:57.793 --> 00:59.472
...and then win that third one in the tie-break?

00:59.635 --> 01:00.358
What was the difference?

01:00.851 --> 01:03.225
Yeah, he started to play much better,...

01:03.309 --> 01:05.489
...very consistent and really more aggressive,...

01:06.047 --> 01:11.516
...but I try to forget about these first and second set and try to concentrate again.

01:12.743 --> 01:15.304
Kei, you added Michael Chang to your coaching team this season.

01:15.391 --> 01:16.917
What kind of advice did Michael give you,...

01:17.671 --> 01:19.779
...playing in your first semifinal at a Grand Slam?

01:21.146 --> 01:23.319
Yeah, he's been helping me a lot...

01:23.787 --> 01:26.426
...him and Dante communicate a lot...

01:26.504 --> 01:29.295
...and we've been working super well.

01:29.796 --> 01:30.889
That's why I'm here.

01:31.597 --> 01:34.387
You're the first Japanese male to be in a final of a major.

01:34.489 --> 01:36.881
What does this do to you back home in Japan?

01:40.257 --> 01:42.265
I hope it's big news in Japan.

01:44.241 --> 01:49.150
I feel the support from Japan even from the TV.

01:49.249 --> 01:54.286
It's four o'clock in the morning, but I hope a lot of people are watching.

01:54.641 --> 01:56.966
I bet you everybody's up watching this great run.

01:57.069 --> 01:59.093
Kei, congratulations, best of luck in the final.

01:59.200 --> 01:59.525
Thank you.
