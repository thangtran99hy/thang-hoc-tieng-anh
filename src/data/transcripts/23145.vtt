00:03.207 --> 00:04.289
What is this place?

00:05.857 --> 00:06.549
Can you tell me your name?

00:07.875 --> 00:08.989
I can't remember anything.

00:10.496 --> 00:11.209
Who put us here?

00:13.694 --> 00:14.159
We don't know.

00:16.250 --> 00:16.936
What's out there?

00:19.195 --> 00:19.894
The maze.

00:20.671 --> 00:24.613
Every morning, when those doors open, the runners look for a way out.

00:25.764 --> 00:27.736
No one has ever survived a night in the maze.

00:30.179 --> 00:31.194
What happens to them?

00:34.801 --> 00:35.597
We don't belong here.

00:36.357 --> 00:38.351
I think it's time we find out what we're really up against.

00:41.109 --> 00:43.561
Everything started changing the moment you showed up.

00:45.470 --> 00:46.083
It's a girl.

00:46.991 --> 00:47.533
Thomas!

00:50.687 --> 00:51.647
Why are we different?

00:52.046 --> 00:53.495
What if we were sent here for a reason?

00:54.633 --> 00:55.689
You're not like the others.

00:56.315 --> 00:56.952
You're curious.

00:59.508 --> 01:06.887
But if you wanna stay here, I need to know that you're gonna follow the rules.
