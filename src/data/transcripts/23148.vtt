00:06.699 --> 00:07.387
Yeah, for sure.

00:09.189 --> 00:14.391
There's a lot of positive things that I learned from these two weeks.

00:16.878 --> 00:21.340
Yeah, it was one of the worst matches I played today,...

00:21.457 --> 00:27.245
...but also he was very aggressive and very fast...

00:27.336 --> 00:32.383
...and I have to say I was a little bit nervous.

00:32.476 --> 00:37.993
A little bit, first final and even semis, but very excited these two weeks.

00:40.800 --> 00:46.485
I didn't expect anything, coming here before, I was injured and had little practice.

00:48.722 --> 00:54.873
There are so many positive things for sure that I can have from these two weeks,...

00:54.981 --> 00:59.255
...beating Stan and Novak again...

00:59.410 --> 01:07.319
...and I'm very disappointed, of course, today, but a very good two weeks.

01:17.054 --> 01:20.880
It's great to bring great news to Japan...

01:20.952 --> 01:25.688
...and you know, tennis has not been the biggest sport in Japan.

01:26.880 --> 01:31.491
Women's, yes, but men's never made this far.

01:31.721 --> 01:37.335
So, I'm very happy to make history and great accomplishments...

01:37.435 --> 01:45.199
...and hopefully, I can win next time and have something, more good results like this.

01:51.867 --> 02:00.322
First of all, I played long three matches, played two five sets...

02:00.411 --> 02:04.791
...and another three hours, I don't know, two hours, against Novak.

02:04.935 --> 02:12.604
And now I'm here, my body's heavy still, but I am able to play.

02:13.603 --> 02:16.795
I don't think, a few years ago, it didn't happen like this.

02:16.977 --> 02:21.774
So, I think I showed my potential.

02:21.865 --> 02:23.447
I can beat anybody now.

02:24.693 --> 02:34.053
So, if I can keep training hard and also practice hard, I think I have more chances coming up.

02:43.385 --> 02:47.628
I mean, beating top guys this week.

02:49.365 --> 02:51.351
It's always fun to play here,...

02:51.841 --> 02:56.929
...a lot of people, very loud.

02:57.954 --> 03:01.529
It's always exciting to play here.
