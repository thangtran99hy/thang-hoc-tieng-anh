00:00.261 --> 00:01.600
This is an office.

00:02.175 --> 00:06.687
It is where many of you will spend the majority of your waking life.

00:07.313 --> 00:11.199
And these are the things that will inevitably happen while you're there.

00:11.430 --> 00:16.345
Regardless of your best intentions, you will develop an addiction to caffeine.

00:16.805 --> 00:19.383
No matter what your relationship status,...

00:19.691 --> 00:22.827
...you will develop some sort of crush on a coworker.

00:23.520 --> 00:28.403
You will fall into one of two camps: the people who are always freezing...

00:28.635 --> 00:31.325
...or the people who are constantly hot.

00:31.727 --> 00:35.447
You will start with one personal item in your office drawer...

00:35.723 --> 00:40.363
...and then one day you'll open it up and realize your entire life is in there.

00:40.583 --> 00:43.009
Someone in your office will creep you out.

00:45.905 --> 00:50.128
And you will bond with someone else over mutually being creeped out.

00:50.640 --> 00:54.899
You will get exceptionally good at hiding Facebook on your computer.

00:55.859 --> 00:59.515
At some point, you will hear one of your coworkers pooping.

01:00.135 --> 01:01.477
That will be a low point.

01:02.657 --> 01:05.604
You'll come face to face with a coworker in a restroom...

01:05.698 --> 01:09.842
...and realize that they don't wash their hands and that will change everything.

01:11.042 --> 01:15.742
You'll gain at least five pounds of fat from all the birthday cookies,...

01:16.088 --> 01:19.864
...cakes and red velvet cupcakes that keep floating around.

01:20.291 --> 01:23.458
And just when you try to cut down on the sweets,...

01:23.578 --> 01:26.419
...your coworkers will pull you back in.

01:27.295 --> 01:33.082
You will fantasize about doing unspeakably strange things to your coworkers.

01:33.329 --> 01:36.408
At some point, you'll bring a personal friend to visit...

01:36.769 --> 01:42.545
...and it will be unexpectedly awkward to introduce them to anyone you work with.

01:43.027 --> 01:47.825
You will get really excited about being good at some small task...

01:48.092 --> 01:52.722
...and then hate it once everyone else starts asking you to do it for them.

01:53.499 --> 01:57.165
And you will form a group of friends in that office...

01:57.443 --> 02:00.539
...who will make every day a whole lot better.
