How much coffee is too much coffee?

00:02.683 --> 00:06.543
Legend holds that "kaffa" or "coffee" was discovered in Western Ethiopia...

00:06.645 --> 00:10.278
...by a man who noticed that his goats were more active after eating coffee beans.

00:10.469 --> 00:14.431
Today, caffeine is the most widely used brain stimulant in the world.

00:14.959 --> 00:18.059
Caffeine works by blocking another chemical in your brain called "adenosine"...

00:18.334 --> 00:20.218
...from bonding to receptors on your neurons.

00:21.117 --> 00:23.817
When adenosine is blocked, this region goes into overdrive,...

00:23.899 --> 00:26.142
...sending a wake-up call to the rest of your brain.

00:26.736 --> 00:28.891
So actually, coffee doesn't stimulate your brain;...

00:28.965 --> 00:31.104
...it just suppresses the part that makes you drowsy.

00:31.925 --> 00:33.299
Is caffeine addictive?

00:33.636 --> 00:35.018
Some scientists think so.

00:35.161 --> 00:36.559
But it's not as bad as other drugs...

00:36.624 --> 00:40.109
...because it doesn't strongly affect the dopamine pathways related to addiction.

00:40.675 --> 00:43.225
Your brain does learn to balance the caffeine though,...

00:43.301 --> 00:46.092
...which is why stopping cold can be a real headache.

00:46.378 --> 00:49.573
And while the equivalent of a hundred cups of coffee can kill you,...

00:49.645 --> 00:51.249
...studies have found that in moderation,...

00:51.335 --> 00:54.225
...it may help protect against Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

00:54.459 --> 00:58.040
So, perhaps our craving for coffee isn't all that bad.
