In the morning and you're making a movie, you get up real early.

00:04.069 --> 00:06.178
So you need all the help you can get.

00:06.954 --> 00:09.335
When I'm reading the script, when I'm rehearsing,...

00:09.436 --> 00:12.005
...coffee goes with my line of work.

00:12.350 --> 00:15.536
Without coffee, I'm gonna feel like something is missing in the day.

00:15.900 --> 00:18.117
I'm gonna feel awkward, I'm not gonna feel the same.

00:19.038 --> 00:21.979
Most of my scripts have coffee stains on them.

00:22.498 --> 00:24.252
That's how you know it's a Pacino script.

00:25.455 --> 00:26.348
This is good coffee.
