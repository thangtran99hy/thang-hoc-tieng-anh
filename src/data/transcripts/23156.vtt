00:00.333 --> 00:01.672
You're at memorial park,...

00:01.785 --> 00:05.271
...a place where those who paid the ultimate price are never forgotten.

00:05.642 --> 00:08.337
And on this day, that's a goal of dozens of people.

00:08.679 --> 00:09.489
This way a little bit.

00:09.719 --> 00:12.521
Their hands placing symbols of freedom in the grass,...

00:12.687 --> 00:15.059
...row after row of red, white and blue.

00:15.407 --> 00:16.856
On each flag, a name.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.776
My brother died on 9/11.

00:19.340 --> 00:21.387
He was in New York City.

00:21.955 --> 00:26.491
Leonard Castrianno worked on the 105th floor of the World Trade Center's North Tower.

00:26.820 --> 00:29.971
It fell at 9:28 in the morning, 13 years ago.

00:30.365 --> 00:35.154
As the dust settled, there, rising out of the ashes, the American flag.

00:35.356 --> 00:39.867
The same colors now dotting this lawn in Omaha, a real-life memorial.

00:40.073 --> 00:44.301
Leonard's sister Lynn from Omaha has been doing this for ten years now.

00:44.722 --> 00:45.644
And she's got some help.

00:46.041 --> 00:48.703
I've been talking to some people and they're like going, "Oh, that's coming up."

00:48.959 --> 00:50.515
So, people are already forgetting.

00:50.678 --> 00:54.246
So, it's always a nice reminder for people to not to forget the tragedy that happened.

00:54.337 --> 00:59.064
So, look at this field of 2,977 flags.

00:59.422 --> 01:01.126
Always remember those we lost.

01:01.564 --> 01:04.441
And from time to time, summon the strength of community...

01:04.835 --> 01:06.557
...that came as our nation healed.
