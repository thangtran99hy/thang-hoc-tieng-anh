00:02.656 --> 00:06.711
A truly great product is ultimately defined...

00:07.150 --> 00:10.212
...by the integration of its hardware and software.

00:11.431 --> 00:16.118
Developing an iPhone with a larger and more advanced display...

00:16.356 --> 00:20.467
...launched one of the most significant design and engineering efforts...

00:20.638 --> 00:22.777
...since we introduced the original product.

00:23.984 --> 00:28.975
With a 4.7 inch display, iPhone 6 becomes taller and wider.

00:29.592 --> 00:32.383
We made the design dramatically thinner...

00:32.700 --> 00:35.777
...while developing a smooth, continuous surface...

00:35.918 --> 00:38.724
...that is comfortable to both hold and use.

00:39.922 --> 00:45.857
We are also introducing iPhone 6 Plus with a larger 5.5 inch display.

00:46.833 --> 00:49.699
And with the same continuous surfaces...

00:49.950 --> 00:53.063
...and seamless material transitions as iPhone 6,...

00:53.416 --> 00:54.565
...it's very thin.

00:57.107 --> 00:59.868
With iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus,...

01:00.147 --> 01:03.501
...we've taken the time to do the deep engineering,...

01:03.961 --> 01:08.186
...to design and develop two entirely new iPhones...

01:08.741 --> 01:11.903
...more significant than just bigger and better displays.

01:12.357 --> 01:15.379
The design has never been so compelling,...

01:15.742 --> 01:19.457
...undoubtedly making this the biggest advance in the iPhone...

01:19.900 --> 01:21.281
...since we launched the original.
