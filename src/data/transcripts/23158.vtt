They say that humans are a dog's best friend and I think that's true.

00:04.637 --> 00:06.819
Hey Gus, tonight is very important to me, okay?

00:06.889 --> 00:08.495
I haven't had a date in a very long time.

00:08.568 --> 00:09.912
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:10.117 --> 00:11.073
He overthinks it.

00:11.393 --> 00:14.553
You chase each other around and then you lick each other's faces.

00:14.632 --> 00:16.108
And it's on. Simple.

00:16.389 --> 00:17.787
Now here's the part that kills me.

00:17.887 --> 00:22.425
They're hungry, there's food in front of them and they just blab for hours.

00:22.917 --> 00:25.167
What do you like to do on the weekends?

00:25.799 --> 00:26.189
Uh-oh!

00:26.971 --> 00:27.629
Don't say it.

00:27.847 --> 00:28.263
Taxes.

00:28.418 --> 00:29.405
Oh, you said it.

00:29.569 --> 00:30.116
Really? That's...

00:30.425 --> 00:31.800
I just do taxes like, all the time.

00:31.997 --> 00:32.501
All right.

00:33.753 --> 00:34.983
Oh my god, Gus!

00:35.081 --> 00:35.811
I love him.

00:36.228 --> 00:37.207
Oh! Awesome.

00:37.317 --> 00:38.133
Yes, it's true.

00:38.343 --> 00:42.152
Part of being a best friend does mean you have to run interference when it's needed.

00:42.236 --> 00:43.121
He is so cool.

00:43.484 --> 00:45.100
Yeah, yeah, he's a good dog.

00:45.277 --> 00:50.382
Well, in any case, if anyone out there wants a dinner date with me, I keep it simple.

00:50.737 --> 00:55.211
Set the table, fill your plates with healthy, delicious food and then we eat.

00:55.403 --> 00:57.603
We can save the talking for when we're full.
