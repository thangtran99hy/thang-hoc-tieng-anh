The fruit of the cacao tree is a football-shaped pod that comes in a variety of colors.

00:08.615 --> 00:14.495
Inside each pod is a sweet, white, fruity pulp that covers 50 to 60 seeds.

00:15.093 --> 00:17.733
It is from these seeds that chocolate is made.

00:18.658 --> 00:23.172
Once the pods are ripe, they are harvested in the same way they have been gathered...

00:23.349 --> 00:25.803
...for thousands of years: by hand.

00:26.253 --> 00:29.405
After collecting the pods, each one is split open.

00:30.048 --> 00:33.902
Then the farmer scoops out the white pulp and separates the seeds,...

00:34.347 --> 00:36.371
...commonly known as "cocoa beans."

00:37.007 --> 00:41.366
The beans are covered with banana leaves or burlap while they ferment in the pulp.

00:42.234 --> 00:46.600
After fermenting, the beans are uncovered and dried in the hot sun.

00:47.291 --> 00:51.549
When the beans have achieved maximum dryness, it's time to go to market.

00:52.519 --> 00:55.945
The farmer puts them in burlap sacks in which they will be sold...

00:56.163 --> 00:59.240
...and shipped to chocolate factories around the world.
