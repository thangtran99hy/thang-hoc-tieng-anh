What's in a logo?

00:01.963 --> 00:04.915
When the Gap went for a radical redesign of their classic logo,...

00:05.122 --> 00:07.209
...the backlash was fast and furious.

00:07.621 --> 00:09.657
When you're thinking about a logo for your business,...

00:09.825 --> 00:13.180
...follow these basic guidelines to make sure you're headed in the right direction.

00:13.688 --> 00:15.609
Go for classic instead of trendy,...

00:15.747 --> 00:19.289
...because constantly changing your logo won't do any favors for your branding.

00:20.015 --> 00:21.600
Stick with clean and streamlined.

00:21.934 --> 00:24.144
Focus on a key image and company name.

00:24.932 --> 00:28.087
Keep in mind that your logo has to translate in lots of different sizes,...

00:28.228 --> 00:30.045
...from a product label to a billboard.

00:30.493 --> 00:31.991
Choose your colors carefully...

00:32.219 --> 00:35.761
...and make sure they jive with everything from your website to product packaging.

00:36.220 --> 00:38.111
Don't be afraid to nitpick over details...

00:38.201 --> 00:40.999
...or go back to the drawing board if you just aren't feeling it.
