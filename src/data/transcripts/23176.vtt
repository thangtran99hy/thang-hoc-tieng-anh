Well, about my guest tonight, he is the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

00:04.163 --> 00:06.905
Please welcome to the program, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

00:07.093 --> 00:09.953
It's a great pleasure for me to be participating in this.

00:14.459 --> 00:16.217
I want to make sure that you're comfortable.

00:16.310 --> 00:18.557
I have been traveling to all these hotspots...

00:19.247 --> 00:21.573
...without exception all around the world.

00:22.239 --> 00:24.789
Sometimes, I have to protect myself...

00:25.214 --> 00:30.695
...and I know that you conduct a lot of difficult interviews,...

00:30.851 --> 00:32.169
...meeting with different people.

00:32.500 --> 00:38.325
I'd like to give you this UN peacekeeping helmet to protect yourself.

00:48.711 --> 00:50.073
Keep it handy.

00:51.017 --> 00:52.537
I may need it for my protection.

00:53.797 --> 00:56.706
Is this your way of telling me I'm being shipped out somewhere?

00:57.751 --> 00:58.305
Oh yeah.

01:02.428 --> 01:03.500
That's very kind of you.

01:03.579 --> 01:08.037
You still believe in the idealism that can rise up...

01:08.357 --> 01:11.572
...and snuff out the types of extremism that we've been seeing.

01:11.682 --> 01:12.921
You're still an optimist.

01:14.535 --> 01:17.866
We have to work, and we have to address and we have to be united.

01:18.105 --> 01:22.241
This is unacceptable in the name of humanity.

01:22.630 --> 01:24.594
How can it be so brutal?

01:25.187 --> 01:27.218
How can it be so cruel?

01:28.191 --> 01:31.531
As a human being, we have to address this one.

01:31.633 --> 01:37.395
I'm asking the whole world regardless of political ideology one may have.

01:37.563 --> 01:39.817
We have to unite in the name of humanity.

01:40.061 --> 01:43.053
Well, you would hope that we will soon reach that tipping point...

01:43.337 --> 01:45.823
...and there will be that type of groundswell,...

01:45.911 --> 01:47.325
...and I appreciate you very much for being here.

01:47.395 --> 01:49.335
I know you have a tremendous amount of work to do.

01:49.595 --> 01:50.531
You may keep this.

01:51.091 --> 01:52.533
Thank you very much.

01:52.713 --> 01:53.435
I will keep this.
