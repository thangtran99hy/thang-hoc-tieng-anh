I've been waiting to upgrade because I knew this was coming along.

00:09.407 --> 00:10.331
This is the 6 Plus.

00:11.077 --> 00:15.559
Yeah, it's big, it's the size of my entire hands and I do not have small hands.

00:15.899 --> 00:16.830
I just feel like I would break this.

00:16.911 --> 00:19.375
This is like holding an envelope or something.

00:19.471 --> 00:21.001
It's kind of like a brick.

00:21.304 --> 00:25.402
I'm not afraid of breaking it, I am afraid that it's just gonna get swiped...

00:25.536 --> 00:28.271
...because it's so big, like it's never gonna fit in my pocket.

00:28.420 --> 00:33.267
It fits in my hand but it's definitely a stretch to get my thumb to the other side.

00:34.545 --> 00:35.467
I can't get in the corner.

00:35.544 --> 00:38.010
The one thing about being big that I do like is that...

00:38.081 --> 00:39.825
...I'll be able to see a little bit better.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.422
I think this is cool 'cause I definitely do a lot of e-mails and stuff on my phone.

00:43.494 --> 00:46.600
And if I have to file stories on my phone or write things on my phone,...

00:46.977 --> 00:47.625
...it can be a little tough.

00:47.702 --> 00:49.755
I was kinda thinking the bigger phone might be good for that.

00:49.833 --> 00:51.787
There is no way it can fit this to my pocket or my purse.

00:51.903 --> 00:55.010
I'm probably going to buy the iPhone 6.

00:55.075 --> 00:57.178
I think I'll have to test it out in the store first.

00:57.355 --> 01:00.227
I think I have to like actually use it to see for sure.
