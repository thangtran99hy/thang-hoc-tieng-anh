00:00.045 --> 00:04.381
No: 139,788.

00:05.843 --> 00:09.836
The announcement of the Fife result made it a mathematical certainty.

00:10.664 --> 00:12.385
The naysayers had won the day.

00:12.707 --> 00:16.175
Scotland voted against independence by a small majority.

00:17.577 --> 00:19.884
Amid relief and happiness for "No" voters,...

00:20.135 --> 00:23.946
...those in charge of the "Yes" campaign were forced to accept defeat.

00:24.087 --> 00:27.223
Scotland has by majority decided not,...

00:27.580 --> 00:30.549
...at this stage, to become an independent country.

00:31.233 --> 00:37.345
I accept that verdict of the people and I call on all of Scotland to follow suit.

00:37.869 --> 00:40.803
It was a win for Alistair Darling's "Better Together" campaign...

00:40.969 --> 00:43.403
We have chosen unity over division...

00:43.775 --> 00:47.205
...and positive change rather than needless separation.

00:47.444 --> 00:49.226
...but also a win for democracy.

00:49.676 --> 00:52.785
Turnout was high, very high, across the board.

00:53.049 --> 00:56.257
The turnout is 87.9 percent.

00:56.693 --> 01:00.868
Prime Minister David Cameron campaigned heavily to keep the United Kingdom together,...

01:01.314 --> 01:03.670
...but he was pragmatic once the results were in.

01:04.113 --> 01:08.929
While delighted that Scotland voted no, he also promised new powers for Scotland.

01:09.119 --> 01:12.645
To all of those who did vote for independence, we hear you.

01:13.609 --> 01:16.753
We now have a chance, a great opportunity,...

01:17.185 --> 01:21.707
...to change the way the British people are governed and change it for the better.

01:22.079 --> 01:25.455
As David Cameron claimed, the Scottish independence debate...

01:25.791 --> 01:27.921
...has been settled for a generation.
