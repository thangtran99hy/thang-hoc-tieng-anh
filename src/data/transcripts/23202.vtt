I was appointed as Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women six months ago...

00:07.281 --> 00:09.280
...and the more I've spoken about feminism,...

00:10.057 --> 00:14.301
...the more I have realized that fighting for women's rights...

00:14.737 --> 00:18.783
...has too often become synonymous with man-hating.

00:20.808 --> 00:28.666
If there is one thing I know for certain, it is that this has to stop.

00:30.147 --> 00:33.858
For the record, feminism by definition...

00:34.700 --> 00:40.453
...is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities.

00:41.264 --> 00:48.382
It is the theory of the political, economic and social equality of the sexes.

00:50.676 --> 00:53.796
I started questioning gender-based assumptions a long time ago,...

00:54.927 --> 00:59.997
...when I was eight, I was confused at being called "bossy"...

01:00.492 --> 01:04.652
...because I wanted to direct the plays that we would put on for our parents...

01:05.543 --> 01:06.915
...but the boys were not.

01:08.394 --> 01:12.952
When at 14, I started to be sexualized by certain elements of the media.

01:14.241 --> 01:19.112
When at 15, my girlfriends started dropping out of their beloved sports teams...

01:19.551 --> 01:21.833
...because they didn't want to appear "muscly".

01:23.049 --> 01:28.745
When at 18, my male friends were unable to express their feelings.

01:30.317 --> 01:36.155
I decided that I was a feminist and this seemed uncomplicated to me.

01:37.215 --> 01:43.707
But my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular word.

01:46.255 --> 01:51.639
Women are choosing not to identify as feminists.

01:53.960 --> 01:59.270
Apparently, I am among the ranks of women whose expressions...

01:59.611 --> 02:08.578
...are seen as too strong, too aggressive, isolating, and anti-men.

02:09.987 --> 02:11.587
Unattractive even.

02:13.809 --> 02:18.595
Why has the word become such an uncomfortable one?
