00:00.459 --> 00:03.399
"Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth..."

00:03.652 --> 00:06.212
Teachers have to answer millions of questions.

00:06.460 --> 00:08.141
How big is outer space?

00:08.283 --> 00:09.869
Where did my sister come from?

00:09.971 --> 00:11.776
Is the sun following me?

00:12.436 --> 00:14.941
Teachers have to deal with every type of emergency.

00:15.197 --> 00:18.309
No one is gonna know that you had an accident.

00:18.937 --> 00:22.433
Okay, let's wrap this around you here.

00:22.669 --> 00:25.327
Teachers have to know everything about everything.

00:25.546 --> 00:26.179
Give it a second.

00:28.499 --> 00:31.655
So in a way, this is a very realistic portrayal of a volcano...

00:31.794 --> 00:34.353
...'cause everybody thought it was gonna explode, but it didn't explode.

00:34.593 --> 00:36.549
Teachers ought to be like a courtroom judge.

00:36.723 --> 00:38.358
They must be honest and fair.

00:38.555 --> 00:41.041
I'm gonna read you the answer you put on your math test.

00:41.309 --> 00:43.011
"I forgot to study last night."

00:43.190 --> 00:46.514
"Here's a drawing of a donkey wearing roller skates."

00:46.891 --> 00:49.547
It's a good drawing, but you gotta study.

00:49.969 --> 00:53.697
In conclusion, teachers have the hardest job in the world.

00:54.606 --> 00:57.635
What amazing things did your teacher do for you?

00:58.405 --> 00:59.224
Tree is here, yes.

00:59.450 --> 01:02.449
Mr. Jeffries!
