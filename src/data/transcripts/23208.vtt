If you think there's more to teaching than multiplication tables and "i" before "e."

00:06.993 --> 00:11.721
If you believe that learning to share makes us better adults, not just better children.

00:12.587 --> 00:17.317
If you understand that when students go home, a teacher's day is far from done.

00:18.272 --> 00:19.758
Lessons need tailoring.

00:20.211 --> 00:21.755
Resources need organizing.

00:23.589 --> 00:28.317
If you believe that teaching is a calling, capable of shaping lives for the better.

00:29.505 --> 00:32.413
If you know our future depends on what we teach today.

00:34.201 --> 00:38.930
If you think teachers deserve recognition and rewards designed just for them.

00:40.001 --> 00:41.373
And above all else,...

00:41.640 --> 00:45.573
...if you believe that teachers do one of the most important jobs in the world,...

00:48.306 --> 00:49.704
...the feeling's mutual.
