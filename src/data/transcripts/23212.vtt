This is a Robobee.

00:09.966 --> 00:14.356
These miniature robots are inspired by the biology of bees and hive behavior,...

00:15.937 --> 00:20.161
...new materials, compact high energy power sources and new control systems...

00:20.739 --> 00:23.927
...and a new method of self-assembly and pop-up manufacturing.

00:24.827 --> 00:27.573
I'm Elizabeth Farrell, a PhD student at SEAS.

00:28.279 --> 00:32.108
I am energized by the potential of an autonomous device that thinks on its own.

00:32.717 --> 00:36.155
It could impact everything from crop pollination to search and rescue.

00:36.829 --> 00:38.631
And that's science not fiction.
