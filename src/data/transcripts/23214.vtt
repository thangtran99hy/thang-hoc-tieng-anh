We've all heard the saying "painting on a smile."

00:06.769 --> 00:11.185
Well, one Japanese artist has taken that phrase to a whole new level.

00:12.167 --> 00:17.635
Nobumichi Asai has found a way to project and map expressions onto people's faces,...

00:17.820 --> 00:20.443
...effectively creating a facial mask.

00:21.131 --> 00:25.745
He and his team displayed their three-dimensional facial projection mapping system...

00:25.839 --> 00:28.471
...to a select group of spectators in Tokyo.

00:30.359 --> 00:32.926
The team drew inspiration from the sense of beauty...

00:33.006 --> 00:37.365
...inherent in traditional Japanese culture, animation and technology.

00:37.802 --> 00:41.579
But they quickly discovered that simply projecting a totally symmetrical face...

00:41.717 --> 00:45.315
...seen typically in video games would produce a Barbie doll look,...

00:45.529 --> 00:46.731
...killing the realism,...

00:46.990 --> 00:51.904
...so they instead designed a face asymmetrically, introducing subtle flaws.
