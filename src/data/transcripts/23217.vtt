I remember looking into her eyes...

00:01.986 --> 00:05.469
...and feeling like our lives would always be connected from that moment on.

00:05.566 --> 00:09.601
It was this strange in sync connection that was overwhelming.

00:09.703 --> 00:12.359
And I remembered feeling like this person...

00:12.547 --> 00:15.328
...is going to be an important person in my life.

00:15.651 --> 00:19.671
There was not a doubt in my mind that she would be the girl that I'd marry someday.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.545
No, really?

00:28.371 --> 00:29.731
Oh, no.

00:31.715 --> 00:33.509
I can't believe!

00:49.657 --> 00:51.263
This is really surreal right now.

00:51.369 --> 00:53.075
I'm in Florence, Italy...

00:53.405 --> 00:56.231
...and the love of my life just proposed to me.

00:58.044 --> 00:58.851
Do you like the ring?

00:59.685 --> 01:00.814
It's so perfect.

01:00.901 --> 01:02.529
It's so perfect.
