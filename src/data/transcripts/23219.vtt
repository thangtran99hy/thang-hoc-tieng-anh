00:01.064 --> 00:03.465
Since I was born I wanted to do something meaningful,...

00:04.717 --> 00:07.035
...and not waste my time on this planet.

00:08.020 --> 00:11.295
You feel every emotion all in one time.

00:12.696 --> 00:16.727
I think it's the greatest challenge you'll ever face in life.

00:17.570 --> 00:20.716
You try it and then you cannot stop.

00:22.467 --> 00:26.053
The joy that comes from seeing something that you thought about...

00:26.295 --> 00:28.685
...and then now you see it starting to take off.

00:28.918 --> 00:30.923
There is nothing that can parallel this.

00:32.351 --> 00:34.397
It's really almost like a very primal thing.

00:35.021 --> 00:37.289
We've been doing it since the beginning of time.

00:41.733 --> 00:46.905
Entrepreneurs start small and they aim high.

00:47.551 --> 00:50.353
And of course, most of them fail on their way.

00:50.729 --> 00:55.877
But once they achieve the goal, they change the world.
