Finally, you don't have to lay eyes on an ad or a baby, or an ad about a baby...

00:05.690 --> 00:08.211
...or wonder if you should unfriend that lady from high school...

00:08.331 --> 00:09.601
...but you're not sure if she'll get upset.

00:09.961 --> 00:15.221
No, these mildly annoying issues are ones that you never have to worry about again.

00:15.483 --> 00:19.061
You see, two things separate Ello from other social networking sites.

00:19.193 --> 00:22.512
One, there are no ads, and two, it's invite only.

00:22.878 --> 00:26.523
You either know someone already on the network or you request an invitation.

00:26.847 --> 00:31.075
Ello was created by a US collective of artists and designers a few months ago.

00:31.161 --> 00:34.399
The reason, according to its manifesto, is this:...

00:34.643 --> 00:36.405
..."We believe in audacity."

00:36.691 --> 00:41.022
"We believe in beauty, simplicity and transparency."

00:41.705 --> 00:46.208
Ello capitalizes on Facebook's faults, priding itself on less ads and more privacy.

00:46.631 --> 00:47.877
You don't need a real name to sign up...

00:48.024 --> 00:50.045
...and you can disable the company's analytics software.

00:50.419 --> 00:53.424
It makes money by charging users for additional features...

00:53.573 --> 00:57.269
...and it has a very minimalist interface, kind of like a Tumblr-Twitter hybrid.

00:57.680 --> 00:59.999
You can post pics, links, vids, vines, whatever.

01:00.339 --> 01:03.801
The news feed is filtered into two streams: friends and noise.

01:04.029 --> 01:05.703
Oh, and there's no "Like" button.
