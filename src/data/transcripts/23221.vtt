Hello, Cosmopolitan Hong Kong.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.353
This is Jessica.

00:14.485 --> 00:15.375
I love Hong Kong.

00:15.466 --> 00:20.815
It's such a vibrant city and I think shopping and food is amazing here.

00:22.658 --> 00:24.535
I'd love to come back often.

00:26.145 --> 00:33.861
So, my fashion tip could be wearing sunglasses as I do at airports or at public places...

00:34.167 --> 00:37.895
...and I'm actually launching a fashion brand called Blanc.

00:38.225 --> 00:40.607
And I hope you guys enjoy it.

00:41.594 --> 00:50.525
I try to drink a lot of water to hydrate myself and I get facials.

00:51.339 --> 01:01.703
And I think cleansing is the most important part, so I use very nice products.

01:04.055 --> 01:13.457
Because I'm always in cities, I like to relax in resorts and swim.
