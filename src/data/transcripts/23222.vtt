In case you haven't heard,...

00:02.179 --> 00:05.030
...there's yet another social media network launching.

00:05.715 --> 00:09.227
Called Ello, it aims to be the world's first social media site...

00:09.308 --> 00:11.145
...that doesn't track your movements on the net...

00:11.283 --> 00:14.135
...or shove advertisements in your face all the time.

00:15.179 --> 00:17.111
Now, of course there's that other huge network...

00:17.198 --> 00:21.159
...that everyone and their mom, dog, and even some inanimate objects use.

00:21.621 --> 00:24.967
The big FB gets its billions by auctioning off your profile...

00:25.061 --> 00:28.852
...and choices to the highest bidder in exchange for ad revenues.

00:30.202 --> 00:34.675
Ello wants to change that by delivering a transparent, smooth experience.

00:35.025 --> 00:37.820
Their slogan, quote, "You are not a product,"...

00:38.203 --> 00:42.818
...is echoed by the simple design that pushes interaction between friends to the forefront.
