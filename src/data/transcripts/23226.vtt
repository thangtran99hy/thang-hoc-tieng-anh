ï»¿Is Mars really red?

00:05.648 --> 00:08.707
When you see Mars in the night sky, it definitely has a reddish tint to it.

00:09.607 --> 00:11.358
People have been noticing that for a long time.

00:11.953 --> 00:14.218
Even the ancient Egyptians called Mars "The Red One."

00:15.396 --> 00:16.593
So where does that redness come from?

00:17.396 --> 00:19.202
Well, a lot of rocks on Mars are full of iron.

00:19.744 --> 00:23.007
And when they're exposed to the great outdoors, they oxidize and turn reddish;...

00:23.455 --> 00:25.977
...the same way an old bike left out in the yard gets all rusty.

00:27.091 --> 00:29.994
When rusty dust from those rocks gets kicked up in the atmosphere,...

00:30.396 --> 00:31.813
...it makes the Martian sky look pink.

00:32.717 --> 00:35.253
From a long way away, the whole planet looks kind of reddish.

00:35.697 --> 00:38.911
But if you get a close-up view with an orbiter, lander or rover,...

00:39.523 --> 00:42.157
...you'll see that a lot of Mars is actually more of a butterscotch color.

00:43.238 --> 00:44.563
Depending on what minerals are around,...

00:44.910 --> 00:49.647
...some landscapes can be more golden, brown, tan or even a little greenish.

00:50.353 --> 00:53.575
So in fact, there are a lot of different colors on what we call the "Red Planet."
