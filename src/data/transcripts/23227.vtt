A real-life Batman has been spotted in Japan.

00:02.849 --> 00:04.087
We've heard of Batman superfans...

00:04.194 --> 00:08.183
...but one individual in Japan is taking their fandom to a whole new level.

00:08.455 --> 00:11.727
The Dark Knight impersonator was recently spotted speeding down the highway...

00:11.883 --> 00:15.190
...wearing all the Bat gear while riding their very own Batcycle.

00:15.558 --> 00:17.657
From the mask to the suit, to the belt and the shoes,...

00:17.811 --> 00:20.097
...this Batman's Bat duds look pretty legit.

00:20.419 --> 00:23.199
After reportedly being spotted outside of the city of Chiba,...

00:23.425 --> 00:27.709
...Japan's Caped Crusader copycat has apparently earned the nickname "Chibatman."

00:28.041 --> 00:30.429
But despite the resemblance to the Batman in the movies,...

00:30.629 --> 00:34.062
...it's clear that Chibatman's superhero powers are much more limited...

00:34.206 --> 00:38.775
...because like the rest of us, he is no match against the forces of traffic.
