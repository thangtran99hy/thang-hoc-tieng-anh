You think you know the story of Dracula.

00:08.393 --> 00:09.925
You have no idea.

00:11.386 --> 00:14.695
Before the legend there was the man, Vlad the Impaler.

00:14.811 --> 00:16.415
He was a warrior, he was a leader,...

00:16.993 --> 00:21.025
...but also he was a family man trying to do right by his people.

00:22.325 --> 00:26.181
He's in that really diabolical situation, giving his son away...

00:26.398 --> 00:30.161
...or fighting a war which is almost impossible to win.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.139
You can't protect us.

00:32.841 --> 00:37.292
It becomes about keeping their family together at all costs.

00:37.524 --> 00:41.823
What Vlad is about to enter into is the ultimate sacrifice.

00:42.214 --> 00:44.005
Because men do not fear swords,...

00:45.944 --> 00:46.943
...they fear monsters.

00:50.160 --> 00:56.664
It's a story of torment and sacrifice and love and violence and power.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.173
They will not be defeated!

01:00.945 --> 01:02.853
This is not who you are.

01:03.766 --> 01:06.921
It's so much fun to be taken on this ride.

01:07.863 --> 01:10.599
There's always a price for power.

01:11.083 --> 01:15.357
People will know the real person behind Dracula and not just the man with the fangs.
