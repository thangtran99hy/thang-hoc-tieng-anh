00:01.084 --> 00:02.518
Welcome to Yotel.

00:02.629 --> 00:05.873
Step inside with me as we take a tour of this trendy,...

00:06.043 --> 00:08.205
...high-tech hotel in Times Square.

00:08.288 --> 00:12.309
The whole design, the whole decor, is very sci-fi.

00:12.406 --> 00:14.617
The idea is really to use technology...

00:14.809 --> 00:17.598
...to get away with this sort of boring administrative task.

00:17.695 --> 00:19.224
Guests check themselves in.

00:19.340 --> 00:23.664
Touch screen, check in, much the same, put your credit card in.

00:24.874 --> 00:27.709
The same as the airlines, it will bring up your booking and give you a room key.

00:28.030 --> 00:29.484
And meet Yobot.

00:29.576 --> 00:32.394
He'll store your luggage and you don't even have to tip him.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.893
The spacious fourth floor lobby includes the club lounge...

00:35.979 --> 00:40.635
...complete with private cabins and a 7,000-square-foot outdoor terrace.

00:40.758 --> 00:45.862
Dojo, the restaurant, features motorized tables transforming into a dance floor...

00:45.946 --> 00:47.197
...at the flick of a switch.

00:47.357 --> 00:50.679
The rooms or cabins as they're called are small but stylish,...

00:50.934 --> 00:54.197
...and at $200 a night, you get pretty much everything you need,...

00:54.381 --> 00:55.577
...plus a moving bed.

00:55.755 --> 00:58.652
Now, if you're a big spender, there's a place for you too:...

00:58.757 --> 01:03.042
...a two-bedroom VIP suite for a cool $1,500 per night.

01:03.273 --> 01:07.241
There's a table here that converts to a pool table, a fireplace.

01:08.999 --> 01:10.180
This is our rotating round bed.
