WEBVTT

00:00.579 --> 00:04.930
From the very beginning, we have been a collective of individuals,...

00:07.115 --> 00:10.077
...different kinds of people from different kinds of places,...

00:11.789 --> 00:14.650
...an intersection of technology and the liberal arts,...

00:16.204 --> 00:18.778
...diverse backgrounds all working together.

00:20.939 --> 00:26.272
One powerful thing we share is the belief that we can make a difference in this world...

00:27.054 --> 00:29.267
...through our products and through our values,...

00:30.275 --> 00:31.411
...through who we are.

00:32.777 --> 00:37.209
For this reason, we put inclusion and diversity at our very center.

00:38.205 --> 00:42.661
We honor individuality, human dignity and equality.

00:45.069 --> 00:47.419
We want people to be themselves...

00:49.270 --> 00:52.713
...and contribute through their own individual experiences...

00:55.925 --> 00:59.861
...because this environment inspires creativity and innovation...

01:01.554 --> 01:05.255
...and empowers us all to do the best work of our lives...

01:07.027 --> 01:07.670
...together.
