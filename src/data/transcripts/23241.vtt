00:06.032 --> 00:07.213
Why do you go away?

00:09.455 --> 00:11.030
It's so you can come back...

00:13.085 --> 00:18.276
...so that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors.

00:19.475 --> 00:22.497
And the people there see you differently too.

00:24.093 --> 00:30.737
After all, coming back to where you started is not the same thing as never leaving.

00:32.980 --> 00:37.267
We won't always know where we are going, only that we should go.

00:39.014 --> 00:43.617
And no matter where we end up, we will land there with open eyes,...

00:45.429 --> 00:51.963
...forever looking for life, for love and for colors.
