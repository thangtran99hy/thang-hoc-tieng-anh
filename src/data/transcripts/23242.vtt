00:01.295 --> 00:05.073
This year's Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to three scientists...

00:05.141 --> 00:09.836
...for an invention that has started to reshape how we light our lives: the blue LED.

00:10.118 --> 00:12.909
The prize was awarded to a trio of Japanese scientists...

00:12.987 --> 00:15.331
...who in the 1990s developed the blue LED...

00:15.741 --> 00:19.491
...which, when combined with red and green LEDs, led to white LED light.

00:19.784 --> 00:22.557
That enabled the use of LED lighting to light homes...

00:22.637 --> 00:24.837
...which could greatly reduce energy consumption,...

00:25.109 --> 00:29.156
...as LED lights last much longer and are much more efficient than traditional light bulbs.

00:29.377 --> 00:34.290
The initial invention of the high brightness blue LED is credited to Professor Shuji Nakamura,...

00:34.403 --> 00:36.628
...who developed it at Nichia Corporation Japan,...

00:36.960 --> 00:39.771
...one of the world's largest manufacturers of LED lights.

00:39.916 --> 00:43.011
Nakamura eventually left Japan and gained American citizenship,...

00:43.159 --> 00:44.735
...which led a number of American outlets...

00:44.803 --> 00:47.567
...to describe the prize's announcement Tuesday like this.

00:47.698 --> 00:50.304
The Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded this morning.

00:50.634 --> 00:53.425
It's gone to two Japanese and one American scientist.

00:53.562 --> 00:58.189
An American scientist is among the recipients of this year's Nobel Prize in Physics.

00:58.378 --> 01:01.949
Well, we're not disputing the fact that Nakamura is an American citizen.

01:02.034 --> 01:04.389
...outlets seemed pretty eager to claim him as such,...

01:04.663 --> 01:08.236
...neglecting the fact that Nakamura has spent almost all his life in Japan,..

01:08.516 --> 01:10.261
...where he created his award-winning invention.

01:10.559 --> 01:13.682
Anyway, if you need proof of the wide reach of Nakamura's invention...

01:13.748 --> 01:17.472
..and you have a smartphone, the light it uses as a flash for your pictures...

01:17.547 --> 01:21.409
...or as a flashlight comes from that combination of red, blue and green light.
