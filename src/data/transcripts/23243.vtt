00:01.163 --> 00:05.835
Praise should not begin with the phrase, "You da..." as in, "You da man."

00:06.919 --> 00:13.184
Ending an expression of praise with the phrase, "and stuff" nullifies the praise.

00:13.945 --> 00:18.485
Ending an expression of praise with the phrase, "Now get back to work!"...

00:18.656 --> 00:20.426
...also nullifies the praise.

00:21.225 --> 00:23.023
In ascending order of forcefulness:

00:23.229 --> 00:29.039
E-mail, face-to-face conversation, handwritten note, bear hug.

00:30.127 --> 00:31.333
No bear hugs.

00:32.523 --> 00:36.171
A handwritten note is worth more than $100 gift card.

00:37.111 --> 00:39.109
But probably not a $200 gift card.

00:40.389 --> 00:41.553
Easy on superlatives:...

00:41.981 --> 00:46.539
...hardest working, most glorious, awesomest, best smelling.

00:48.549 --> 00:51.457
Praise followed by criticism is not praise.

00:52.507 --> 00:56.496
Praise followed by praise is probably a little too much praise.

00:57.401 --> 01:02.243
Praise followed by criticism followed by praise is a sandwich.
