ï»¿Where were you born?

00:01.157 --> 00:02.745
I was born in Seoul, South Korea.

00:02.859 --> 00:05.521
We moved to Regina, Saskatchewan.

00:05.955 --> 00:07.147
It's so cold over there. 

00:07.413 --> 00:08.813
We moved there and then moved to Michigan.

00:09.159 --> 00:10.805
And so your parents,...

00:11.793 --> 00:15.034
...then your parents were not happy that you chose this profession.

00:15.764 --> 00:21.895
No, my parents are Korean and traditionally, that first generation of Korean-Americans...

00:22.036 --> 00:27.007
...aren't too happy with the little curveball that you throw them when you're a kid so,...

00:27.119 --> 00:28.513
And now they must be so proud of you.

00:28.599 --> 00:30.467
Oh, now they just have so much advice.

00:30.589 --> 00:31.091
They're so sweet.

00:31.159 --> 00:32.281
Yeah, they must be so proud.
