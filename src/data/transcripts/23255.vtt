Can you please never release an album on iTunes...

00:03.487 --> 00:07.087
...that automatically downloads to people's playlists ever again?

00:07.180 --> 00:08.562
It's really rude.

00:12.975 --> 00:17.292
Oops, I'm sorry about that.

00:18.624 --> 00:23.144
I had this beautiful idea but I got carried away with ourselves.

00:25.461 --> 00:27.339
Artists are prone to that kind of thing,...

00:28.238 --> 00:32.577
...drop of megalomania and touch of generosity.

00:33.848 --> 00:38.873
Dash of self-promotion and deep fear...

00:39.012 --> 00:44.475
...that these songs that we poured our life into over the last few years might not be heard.

00:45.799 --> 00:46.991
It's a lot of noise out there.

00:47.961 --> 00:53.343
I guess we got a little noisy ourselves to get through it.
