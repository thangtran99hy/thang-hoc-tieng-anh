00:01.315 --> 00:02.339
I'm a statistic.

00:02.552 --> 00:06.655
I'm one in five children that came in contact with the Ebola virus in the United States.

00:11.189 --> 00:16.738
I was solving a math problem when I became a statistic.

00:17.499 --> 00:19.667
I was thinking about what to have for lunch.

00:20.113 --> 00:21.884
I was hanging out with my friends.

00:22.987 --> 00:25.213
I don't want to become a statistic.

00:26.450 --> 00:28.229
I don't wanna be a statistic.

00:28.721 --> 00:30.207
Me neither.

00:32.123 --> 00:33.939
I still haven't finished my book yet.

00:34.461 --> 00:36.517
And I have a basketball game to catch.

00:38.953 --> 00:42.316
What are you going to do to prevent me from becoming another statistic?
