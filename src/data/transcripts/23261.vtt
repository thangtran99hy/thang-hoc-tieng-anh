A visit to Denmark is a journey.

00:05.881 --> 00:09.511
So why not make the most of it and use the journey to the congress...

00:09.576 --> 00:11.910
...to show some different aspects of Denmark?

00:12.917 --> 00:17.192
We have an excellent modern infrastructure with efficient public transport...

00:17.559 --> 00:19.049
...and distances are short.

00:20.003 --> 00:22.348
They could get an understanding of our way of life,...

00:22.851 --> 00:24.403
...rub shoulders with the natives...

00:24.845 --> 00:27.393
...and maybe even do a little sightseeing en route.

00:28.781 --> 00:29.933
We could show them examples...

00:30.008 --> 00:33.265
...of the cutting-edge technology Denmark excels in...

00:33.675 --> 00:36.033
...like our robot and welfare technology...

00:36.283 --> 00:40.480
...and green tech solutions such as our offshore windmills and solar panels.

00:40.875 --> 00:44.001
And finally, you can use Lego in your meetings...

00:44.262 --> 00:46.969
...to help encourage great new ways of thinking.
