ï»¿I feel very privileged, lucky that I have had a wonderful life...

00:11.179 --> 00:13.817
...and that I have been always allowed to do what I love.

00:16.023 --> 00:18.791
I always say that to me, my role as a designer...

00:18.853 --> 00:21.275
...is to do the very best I can for that woman,...

00:22.213 --> 00:23.895
...to make her feel her very best.

00:24.197 --> 00:27.845
The foundation of his work is great dressmaking and craftsmanship.

00:28.125 --> 00:31.581
Yet, when you see an Oscar de la Renta dress, you'd see the woman first...

00:31.751 --> 00:34.802
...and the dress only complements her beauty and her personality.

00:34.939 --> 00:35.649
Good smile.

00:36.727 --> 00:40.942
I always tell the girls to smile because I hate sad faces.

00:44.643 --> 00:47.955
Oscar has had a great history of dressing first ladies.

00:48.795 --> 00:53.609
Fashion is nonpolitical and nonpartisan.

00:53.995 --> 00:55.872
To me, it's a tremendous privilege...

00:55.971 --> 00:58.834
...that I have been able to dress all these extraordinary ladies.

00:59.904 --> 01:03.623
What counts is now and the immediate future, not the past.

01:03.700 --> 01:05.671
I never look back, I always look forward.

01:05.897 --> 01:11.338
I am lucky that I am part of that movement to understand the power of a woman today.
