In the wake of the two nurses diagnosed with Ebola in Dallas...

00:05.396 --> 00:07.650
...and the subsequent fear and fallout,...

00:07.901 --> 00:10.145
...one measure that's been floated consistently...

00:10.225 --> 00:13.797
...is that of a travel ban on the worst affected West African countries.

00:14.252 --> 00:16.627
We should not be allowing these folks in, period.

00:16.725 --> 00:17.941
Now is that time.

00:18.039 --> 00:21.785
Let's put in place those travel restrictions that we're looking for.

00:21.882 --> 00:23.800
So why all of this talk about a ban?

00:24.031 --> 00:25.739
Fear could be one motivating factor.

00:25.820 --> 00:29.972
After it was revealed that one of the nurses diagnosed with Ebola took a flight to Cleveland,...

00:30.096 --> 00:33.472
...fears escalated that more people could have been exposed to the virus.

00:33.637 --> 00:36.468
But another factor seems more and more to be politics,...

00:36.536 --> 00:38.345
...with elections only a couple of weeks away.

00:38.534 --> 00:43.398
Reporting for NPR, Juana Summers looks at how Ebola response has become a political debate,...

00:43.638 --> 00:46.681
...getting wrapped up into the issue of national security and ISIS.

00:46.785 --> 00:49.741
The coverage has overshadowed the original source of the outbreak.

00:50.028 --> 00:52.489
Now, all of a sudden because there are cases in the West,...

00:52.578 --> 00:54.134
...here in the United States, in Europe,...

00:54.913 --> 00:57.666
...we're spending a lot of time covering those cases...

00:57.733 --> 01:01.457
...and we're not talking about where the epicenter is, in Western Africa.

01:01.617 --> 01:06.313
There, the CDC says close to 4500 people have died of the virus...

01:06.606 --> 01:09.542
...and the number of total cases is nearing 9000.

01:09.805 --> 01:11.537
For Newsy, I'm Sebastian Martinez.
