Halloween is such a fun holiday.

00:02.513 --> 00:06.649
Here's a unique "At Home" idea to help wow your guest and your trick-or-treaters.

00:07.165 --> 00:11.511
Today I'm gonna show you how to transform your entryway table into a candy bar.

00:11.735 --> 00:13.011
You can choose a table runner.

00:13.368 --> 00:14.945
Here I've got some really cool gauze.

00:15.226 --> 00:17.605
It's an easy way to add tone and texture...

00:17.903 --> 00:21.611
...and then this serves as your foundation so you can start layering your display.

00:22.244 --> 00:25.209
Next, add some height for that visual punch.

00:25.464 --> 00:27.721
These glass jars do just the trick...

00:28.076 --> 00:31.707
...and the treat when you fill them with colorful candy just for show.

00:32.083 --> 00:36.743
Now, a really easy design tip for adding depth is to vary the heights of your jars.

00:37.055 --> 00:40.029
You can do that by stacking them on books or boxes.

00:40.123 --> 00:43.285
Fill in any empty spaces you see with small decorative items.

00:43.594 --> 00:49.199
You can throw in some spooky spiders, creepy cobwebs or some scary skeletons.

00:49.477 --> 00:52.613
And then for ambience, I've just added these votive candles.

00:52.833 --> 00:55.702
These are actually very realistic-looking LED lights.
