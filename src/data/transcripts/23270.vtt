Some years ago, one of my colleagues was doing a tour...

00:12.302 --> 00:15.740
...when one of the members of his tour, a young man, fell down,...

00:16.027 --> 00:19.356
...but when the man got up, he was actually looking quite angry.

00:19.499 --> 00:22.900
When asked how he was, he said he would have been okay...

00:23.437 --> 00:25.297
...if someone hadn't just walked through him.

00:28.751 --> 00:32.399
One of the most famous stories about Dover Castle is that of our drummer boy,...

00:32.483 --> 00:34.167
...our headless drummer boy.

00:34.475 --> 00:36.497
And from time to time over the centuries,...

00:36.615 --> 00:39.199
...his form has been seen walking along the battlements...

00:39.410 --> 00:42.437
...and more often a drumming sound foretelling war.
