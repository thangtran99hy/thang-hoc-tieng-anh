Well, my name is Florentijn Hofman.

00:07.193 --> 00:10.479
I live and work in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and I work in public space.

00:10.709 --> 00:12.793
My sculptures are huge most of the time.

00:14.391 --> 00:16.509
Well, the size of my objects are very important...

00:16.575 --> 00:19.661
...because I have to compete with architecture...

00:19.821 --> 00:22.346
...and I have to compete with humans.

00:22.471 --> 00:25.767
I have to compete with squares of a city.

00:26.108 --> 00:28.189
And I have to compete with advertisement.

00:28.547 --> 00:32.941
If you scale like a fly, like this size, you see a fly.

00:33.452 --> 00:39.443
And it changes the city, so I think scale is very important.
