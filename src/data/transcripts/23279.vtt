00:00.674 --> 00:01.559
"For."

00:02.320 --> 00:03.967
"For" is an attitude.

00:05.289 --> 00:08.703
Only three letters, but the start of everything great.

00:09.348 --> 00:12.656
"For" is a force that challenges the status quo.

00:14.193 --> 00:19.811
"For" means, "We are going to the moon" instead of "Let's stay at home."

00:20.613 --> 00:22.573
"For" is always optimistic.

00:22.933 --> 00:25.225
"For" is in all of us.

00:28.460 --> 00:30.069
Be for something.

00:30.653 --> 00:34.172
For in life with more wow and more now.

00:34.929 --> 00:37.343
For more space and less waste.

00:38.637 --> 00:41.145
For loving your city even more.

00:41.512 --> 00:43.555
Being against something is the easy way,...

00:44.559 --> 00:51.069
...but being for something is an attitude that can change the world.
