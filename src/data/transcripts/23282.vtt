So what's new with the iPad?

00:02.124 --> 00:04.431
Well, the most important new spec is that it's thinner than ever.

00:04.589 --> 00:05.945
And I mean super thin.

00:06.395 --> 00:09.879
6.1 millimeters: thinner than the thinnest tablet we've had in our labs,...

00:09.977 --> 00:12.860
...the 6.4-millimeter Sony Xperia Z2.

00:13.169 --> 00:17.253
The new 8-megapixel camera has improved specs over previous iPads, which had five.

00:17.647 --> 00:20.083
But it still doesn't match the camera specs on the iPhone 6.

00:20.329 --> 00:21.349
It has a new processor.

00:21.597 --> 00:23.372
They claim it should be 40% faster.

00:23.635 --> 00:26.253
But it also uses 802.11ac Wi-Fi,...

00:26.357 --> 00:30.015
...which our tests confirm can be faster than conventional Wi-Fi connections.
