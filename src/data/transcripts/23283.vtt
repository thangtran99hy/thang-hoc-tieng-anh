The video of "I Won't Let You Down," we shot the whole thing in Japan.

00:08.505 --> 00:11.815
There's an incredible, incredible creative director named Mori Harano...

00:11.977 --> 00:15.915
...and I'd seen his work years ago and I met him in France.

00:16.169 --> 00:17.949
Finally, we found a way to work with Mori,...

00:18.036 --> 00:22.726
...we came to Japan and worked with Honda, so we spent a month in Japan.

00:23.008 --> 00:27.995
This video was largely inspired by the legendary choreographer Busby Berkeley...

00:28.109 --> 00:33.187
...who did, in the early 20th century, did these amazing musical numbers...

00:33.367 --> 00:35.821
...with dozens or sometimes hundreds of dancers.

00:37.046 --> 00:39.851
Another inspiration for this video were the big mass games that,...

00:40.932 --> 00:43.398
...you know, there are some of these crazy North Korean mass games.

00:43.473 --> 00:49.832
But there's also, there's an old Japanese sport of mass games,...

00:50.337 --> 00:54.892
...where groups of people do this crazy choreography and routines together.

00:55.603 --> 00:59.092
So to try to come up with our own version of that,...

00:59.807 --> 01:02.063
...and to imagine big patterns and big shapes,...

01:02.159 --> 01:05.576
...we used a computer program to previsualize it.

01:05.699 --> 01:08.739
It was so fun to play with that we're gonna try to actually...

01:09.093 --> 01:12.541
...make a version of the video that you can, that's interactive...

01:12.738 --> 01:15.048
...and users can actually make their own version of the video.
