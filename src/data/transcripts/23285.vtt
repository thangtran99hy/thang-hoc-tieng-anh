Hi, ï»¿I'm Dan Costa with PCMag and this is what's new now.

00:08.679 --> 00:11.731
After 14 years dominating the online marketplace together,...

00:12.097 --> 00:13.645
...Ebay and Paypal are splitting up.

00:14.033 --> 00:15.808
The break will happen in early 2015...

00:15.875 --> 00:18.037
...and will result in two independent public companies.

00:18.374 --> 00:20.036
The board said the move will allow both companies...

00:20.119 --> 00:22.730
...to focus on their core businesses and grow more quickly.

00:23.175 --> 00:26.306
At the moment, Paypal contributes about half of all of Ebay's revenues,...

00:26.729 --> 00:29.597
...but it's projected to grow much faster than the online retailer.
