Well, the bulk of you will end this month with something atrocious on your lip.

00:04.136 --> 00:05.881
The rest of you will be passable.

00:06.217 --> 00:10.353
But in the spirit of awareness, I wanted to offer a few simple ideas of my own...

00:10.423 --> 00:13.573
...that can help a novice grow a full and thicker mustache.

00:13.862 --> 00:14.787
Hammer a nail.

00:15.952 --> 00:17.948
Send a regular handwritten letter.

00:18.278 --> 00:21.002
Capture a household bug then set it free.

00:21.278 --> 00:22.820
Tolerate a crying baby.

00:22.946 --> 00:23.764
Smell wood.

00:25.249 --> 00:26.488
Gain the trust of a dog.

00:27.017 --> 00:27.705
Sweat.

00:28.066 --> 00:29.099
Eat a raw onion.

00:30.518 --> 00:34.574
And finally and most importantly, don't shave your upper lip.

00:34.775 --> 00:38.408
So get ready for the single manliest journey of your life.

00:38.923 --> 00:44.309
And be sure to tell your friends, this mustache is a Movember mustache.
