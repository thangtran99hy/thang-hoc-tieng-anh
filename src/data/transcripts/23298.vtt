00:03.182 --> 00:06.345
I'm very happy to win the first match for me today.

00:07.460 --> 00:11.432
I never beat Andy before so I was very excited to play today.

00:11.548 --> 00:14.099
And I'm very happy the way I played today.

00:17.843 --> 00:20.069
I had more confidence, obviously.

00:20.759 --> 00:25.357
I was a different player than last year and I had good results.

00:25.677 --> 00:26.782
Best year so far.

00:27.907 --> 00:30.876
I think I was hitting more aggressively...

00:30.973 --> 00:35.073
...and I had more confidence and everything worked well today.

00:35.383 --> 00:38.003
I was a little bit nervous when I got into the stadium,...

00:38.134 --> 00:40.029
...because this is a huge stadium,...

00:40.121 --> 00:44.122
...a lot of people, almost packed, and playing Andy first match.

00:44.255 --> 00:47.118
So I was nervous, a little bit,...

00:47.199 --> 00:51.326
...but at the same time I was really excited for today's match...

00:51.467 --> 00:55.731
...and this is the first opportunity for me to play London Tour Finals.

00:56.478 --> 00:59.964
I was a bit excited to play today.

01:03.693 --> 01:05.832
Yeah, I knew this is a very important match.

01:06.209 --> 01:10.059
First match is always a struggle, a little bit.

01:10.177 --> 01:15.474
But I'll try to play a little bit relaxed, maybe for the second and third match,...

01:15.583 --> 01:18.819
...but hopefully I can qualify for the semifinal.
