So, rumination disorder or rumination syndrome is an unusual type of eating problem...

00:11.683 --> 00:15.003
...that's somewhat related to bulimic type eating problems...

00:15.094 --> 00:18.224
...where a person spontaneously regurgitates...

00:18.965 --> 00:21.687
...part of what they've eaten at the course of a meal or a snack.

00:22.049 --> 00:24.491
The food spontaneously regurgitates into the mouth...

00:24.679 --> 00:29.193
...and the person with rumination syndrome then either spits it out or reswallows the food.

00:29.411 --> 00:33.678
We don't know everything about how to treat rumination syndrome when it emerges.

00:34.110 --> 00:38.669
There are some strategies that can be employed, psychotherapy strategies,...

00:38.788 --> 00:44.531
...some relaxation techniques can be employed to try to limit the extent of that behavior.
