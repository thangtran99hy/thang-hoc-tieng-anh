All right, FashionTV.

00:08.260 --> 00:11.030
So we've got with me the lovely Jessica Michibata...

00:11.117 --> 00:14.357
...who's causing quite a commotion here in Isetann.

00:14.492 --> 00:14.801
Yes.

00:15.133 --> 00:20.203
As a talented designer, tell me, what goes into creating these lovely bags?

00:20.781 --> 00:25.438
Well, I always try to come up with a theme, first of all,...

00:25.555 --> 00:31.589
...and obviously, I wanna design a bag that I'll actually use as well.

00:31.941 --> 00:36.607
So I always come up with, I would say, I don't know, some kind of icon...

00:36.781 --> 00:40.654
...and also try to make it useful as well at the same time.

00:41.139 --> 00:43.831
And Samantha Thavasa is such an iconic Japanese brand...

00:43.907 --> 00:46.193
...so I wanna keep that "kawaii," you know, cute.

00:47.464 --> 00:48.618
"Kawaii" means "cute."

00:48.629 --> 00:48.898
Yes.

00:48.976 --> 00:50.175
I learnt that when we were in Japan.

00:50.969 --> 00:56.973
Exactly, so I wanna keep that feel as well in my bag collection.

00:56.975 --> 00:59.367
They're quite girlie and quite feminine bags, aren't they?

00:59.624 --> 00:59.950
Oh yes.

01:00.038 --> 01:04.798
Lots of pink, lots of bows and hearts and lots of all the cute stuff.
