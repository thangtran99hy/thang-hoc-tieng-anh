How's it going?

00:03.706 --> 00:04.906
Stephen with Kiwibox.com.

00:05.015 --> 00:08.520
We're up in Island Def Jam Records in New York City where I'm hanging out with Utada.

00:08.635 --> 00:09.264
How are you today?

00:09.860 --> 00:11.056
I'm doing very well, thank you.

00:11.131 --> 00:11.576
How are you?

00:11.661 --> 00:12.213
I'm doing good.

00:12.329 --> 00:14.772
So, your English breakout album is about to come out.

00:14.863 --> 00:16.605
How excited are you to have it out there?

00:16.941 --> 00:20.881
I've been getting a really good response from everyone who's heard it so far.

00:21.537 --> 00:24.093
I've just begun doing all these interviews, and now I'm really like,...

00:25.771 --> 00:26.867
..."When is it going to end?"

00:27.240 --> 00:30.420
Well, I listened to the single "Come Back to Me" and surprisingly,...

00:30.495 --> 00:34.131
...you seem to go with a more club-friendly, up-tempo kind of song.

00:34.210 --> 00:35.776
You went with more of a "ballady" song.

00:36.019 --> 00:37.382
What was the decision behind that?

00:37.645 --> 00:45.015
The whole song, the words and the singing, it sort of enters you naturally.

00:46.057 --> 00:47.957
It comes into you easily.

00:48.645 --> 00:53.414
That was the opinion and so it should be good as the first single.

00:53.529 --> 00:56.547
You know what, honestly, I think the music scene is lacking a bit of,...

00:57.171 --> 00:57.875
...what's the term, like...

00:58.119 --> 00:58.679
Pizzazz?

00:58.790 --> 00:59.681
Pizzazz, yes.

01:00.047 --> 01:05.658
Maybe that's why it seems like a good time for these foreign forces to invade.

01:06.638 --> 01:08.921
Hi, this is Utada; you're watching Kiwibox.

01:09.675 --> 01:10.763
Very cute, by the way.
