ï»¿Bob Geldof and a host of stars doing what the musician and campaigner claims...

00:05.247 --> 00:08.487
...many governments are failing to do effectively: tackle Ebola.

00:08.965 --> 00:10.741
The charity single was released on Monday.

00:11.085 --> 00:13.036
The response, says Geldof, has been "manic."

00:13.511 --> 00:16.201
The organizers insist that a hundred percent of the proceeds...

00:16.292 --> 00:17.775
...will go towards the relief effort.

00:18.081 --> 00:21.396
Ebola has killed more than 5,000 people, mostly in West Africa.

00:22.416 --> 00:24.284
The song was first recorded 30 years ago,...

00:24.555 --> 00:26.967
...a unique moment in the history of pop in Britain:...

00:27.200 --> 00:28.897
...creating the charity single.

00:30.367 --> 00:31.278
Can you spot the lineup?

00:31.545 --> 00:33.230
It includes global stars like Bono.

00:33.419 --> 00:36.612
But critics point out only one African-born performer is in the lineup,...

00:36.971 --> 00:39.941
...while interest is also focused on those who turned down their invitations...

00:40.067 --> 00:41.325
...like Adele and David Bowie.

00:41.925 --> 00:43.668
Who will turn up for the European versions?

00:44.021 --> 00:46.732
It's rumored Carla Bruni will appear on the French recording.
