00:04.858 --> 00:08.083
Rosetta had been traveling in space towards a comet...

00:08.407 --> 00:13.461
...called 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko for ten years.

00:13.891 --> 00:16.755
The journey was long and she fell into a deep sleep...

00:17.179 --> 00:20.792
...that lasted for 2 years, 7 months and 12 days.

00:21.343 --> 00:27.368
But on the 20th of January 2014, with the help of everyone on Earth shouting,...

00:27.669 --> 00:30.905
..."Wake up, Rosetta," she opened her eyes...

00:31.052 --> 00:34.464
...and let everyone back home know she was okay.

00:36.111 --> 00:37.889
There was no time to lose.

00:38.287 --> 00:41.682
All of the experiments that were packed on board had to be woken up...

00:42.434 --> 00:44.849
...along with a lander, Philae.

00:46.177 --> 00:49.629
Before long, Rosetta was able to see the comet in the distance.

00:50.077 --> 00:54.975
She was getting closer and closer, but there were still many challenges ahead.

00:56.117 --> 00:59.936
There were ten maneuvers to complete, but Rosetta was determined.

01:00.650 --> 01:05.103
As she checked them off one by one, the comet got closer and closer.

01:06.017 --> 01:09.922
It was the most wonderful sight that Rosetta had ever seen.
