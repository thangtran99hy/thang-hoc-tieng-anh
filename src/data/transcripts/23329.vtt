00:06.917 --> 00:09.055
ï»¿Apple is saving up for something big.

00:09.273 --> 00:12.541
With a cash stockpile of roughly 158 billion dollars,...

00:12.666 --> 00:15.715
...a lot of people are wondering what Apple will do with all that money.

00:16.187 --> 00:20.922
And today's Top 5, I'm counting down the five most disruptive yet plausible companies...

00:21.186 --> 00:23.176
...that Apple could buy with their billions.

00:23.754 --> 00:26.697
Starting off at number 5: Netflix.

00:27.065 --> 00:31.043
Valued at around 26 billion dollars, Apple could scoop up Netflix...

00:31.135 --> 00:32.719
...and still have plenty of money in the bank.

00:33.089 --> 00:34.074
How about number 4?

00:34.649 --> 00:35.581
Starbucks!

00:35.949 --> 00:40.453
For around 57 billion dollars, Apple could own every street corner in America...

00:40.729 --> 00:43.819
...and control access to one of our favorite legal drugs.

00:45.087 --> 00:48.623
Back on more plausible ground at number 3: Tesla.

00:49.037 --> 00:50.635
Heck, you could throw in Ford, too.

00:50.999 --> 00:53.379
With combined value of under 100 billion dollars,...

00:53.481 --> 00:57.847
...Apple could take the bad boy of automakers and the mom jeans of automakers...

00:58.095 --> 01:02.061
...and create something as disruptive to cars as the iPhone was to smartphones.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.681
At number 2: buy a carrier.

01:05.161 --> 01:07.902
Big guns like AT&T and Verizon are just out of budget...

01:08.001 --> 01:11.582
...so I propose Deutsch Telecom aka T. Mobile.

01:11.897 --> 01:18.602
And now, my number 1 pick for the company Apple should acquire with their giant pile of cash: Comcast.

01:19.171 --> 01:19.831
So, there you go.

01:19.981 --> 01:23.321
Five companies Apple could easily snatch up with their billions.
