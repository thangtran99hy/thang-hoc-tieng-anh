00:00.843 --> 00:02.843
I'm really proud of you for going on this trip.

00:03.301 --> 00:04.390
You're gonna have so much fun.

00:05.259 --> 00:08.500
And remember, if something chases you, run.

00:10.699 --> 00:13.497
We have learned more in the past decade from genetics...

00:13.932 --> 00:15.986
...than a century of digging up bones.

00:16.885 --> 00:18.817
A whole new frontier has opened up.

00:19.215 --> 00:22.724
We have our first genetically modified hybrid.

00:25.796 --> 00:27.622
You just went and made a new dinosaur?

00:28.402 --> 00:29.397
Probably not a good idea.

00:32.352 --> 00:33.609
The wall's 40 feet high.

00:33.959 --> 00:35.083
You really think she climbed out?

00:35.945 --> 00:36.613
Depends.

00:37.307 --> 00:37.891
On what?

00:39.407 --> 00:41.645
What kind of dinosaur they cooked up in that lab.

00:45.879 --> 00:46.916
Evacuate the island.

00:49.527 --> 00:51.029
She's a highly intelligent animal.

00:53.463 --> 00:56.213
She will kill anything that moves.

00:58.341 --> 00:58.883
Oh god.
