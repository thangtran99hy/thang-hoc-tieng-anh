Sardinia's beautiful Costa Smeralda is also known as...

00:03.719 --> 00:05.292
..."The billionaire's playground of opulence."

00:05.441 --> 00:08.445
The drinks are just astronomical.

00:08.530 --> 00:10.932
I mean, the prices are insane.

00:11.234 --> 00:14.342
The up-and-comer on the list is the Croatian island of Hvar,...

00:14.600 --> 00:16.775
...said to be the sunniest spot in all of Europe...

00:16.871 --> 00:20.263
...and is a favorite party spot among the royals including Prince Harry.

00:20.707 --> 00:23.075
You know it's a good spot if Prince Harry is partying there.

00:23.634 --> 00:25.748
It's a little town, it's gorgeous.

00:25.861 --> 00:27.205
The water is beautiful.

00:27.804 --> 00:30.115
The party scene is all along the harbor,...

00:30.210 --> 00:32.473
...so you kind of go to one club to the next, to the next.

00:32.639 --> 00:33.559
It's not pretentious.

00:35.435 --> 00:36.495
It's still new.
