00:00.050 --> 00:01.236
When it comes to the big day,...

00:01.435 --> 00:04.429
...we'll label and check your pet into our dedicated animal zone...

00:04.745 --> 00:07.028
...and make sure that they're perfectly fit to fly.

00:07.237 --> 00:10.742
Inside, it's fully air-conditioned, heated and ventilated.

00:11.003 --> 00:14.822
Most importantly, it's calm and peaceful so there's no need to worry.

00:14.923 --> 00:18.667
They're in safe hands and you can come all the way to the doors to say goodbye.

00:19.314 --> 00:22.415
When it's time to board, one of our dedicated animal vehicles...

00:22.512 --> 00:24.183
...will chauffeur your pet to the aircraft.

00:24.549 --> 00:26.532
They'll be the last on and the first off,...

00:26.775 --> 00:30.395
...ensuring that there's minimum exposure to any hustle and bustle outside.

00:31.148 --> 00:36.501
Before boarding, our captains are notified of our feathered, furry and fishy passengers on board,...

00:36.683 --> 00:39.933
...and they'll set a comfortable temperature so that they feel right at home.

00:40.901 --> 00:44.251
Once in the air, it's time to relax and enjoy the flight.

00:44.555 --> 00:46.373
On board, it's nice and peaceful,...

00:46.474 --> 00:49.669
...allowing your pet to relax and snooze throughout the journey.

00:49.853 --> 00:52.895
When the plane lands, we know you'll be eager to see them.

00:53.063 --> 00:54.225
But we're almost there.

00:54.843 --> 00:59.743
It's just a short journey from the aircraft to the animal zone before you're finally reunited.
