What is flow?

00:01.223 --> 00:04.241
Flow is the experience you have on these really satisfying days...

00:04.323 --> 00:07.631
...when you're productive, confident and operating at your full potential.

00:08.062 --> 00:11.626
When a team is in flow it is innovative, harmonious and productive.

00:12.100 --> 00:14.577
Being part of it improves the performance of each member.

00:15.038 --> 00:17.709
Psychologist, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi...

00:17.962 --> 00:20.911
...writes that team flow is characterized by five things:...

00:21.201 --> 00:23.251
...Clarity, knowing what's expected of you.

00:23.468 --> 00:26.746
Centering, knowing that your teammates are interested in what you're doing.

00:27.112 --> 00:29.379
Choice, knowing that you have options.

00:29.667 --> 00:33.608
Commitment, a sense of trust in your team that lets you feel unselfconscious.

00:33.999 --> 00:37.229
Challenge, increasingly complex challenges to tackle.

00:37.873 --> 00:40.669
From revolutionary self-managed teams with no leaders...

00:40.890 --> 00:42.690
...to virtual teams spanning the globe...

00:42.772 --> 00:45.257
...while working around the clock to collaborate digitally,...

00:45.646 --> 00:48.533
...new technology has opened up a wealth of possibilities...

00:48.727 --> 00:51.173
...and put traditional limitations into retirement.

00:51.819 --> 00:54.602
We want you to harness the power of collaboration.

00:54.841 --> 00:59.812
Find better ways to create via technology and work smarter every day as a team,...

01:00.014 --> 01:02.939
...stronger and more powerful than any lone ranger.
