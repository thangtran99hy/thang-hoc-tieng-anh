00:05.731 --> 00:07.226
Just a little pouch of pudding.

00:07.313 --> 00:08.276
They're squishy.

00:08.432 --> 00:10.727
It looks like a half-and-half.

00:13.651 --> 00:14.801
That is really gross.

00:16.853 --> 00:18.113
Pocari Sweat.

00:18.968 --> 00:20.508
This drink is named "sweat."

00:20.677 --> 00:22.535
Like a little bit lemony, like really flat Sprite.

00:22.664 --> 00:24.722
You thought it was gonna be carbonated.

00:25.050 --> 00:25.615
It's not.

00:25.707 --> 00:27.545
I could be drinking someone's sweat right now.

00:29.159 --> 00:30.428
Kit Kat, that's fun.

00:30.589 --> 00:33.031
Ooh, it looks awful on the inside.

00:33.439 --> 00:34.987
What flavor is green?

00:35.152 --> 00:37.404
Why would you do this to Kit Kats?

00:37.695 --> 00:40.804
I'm gonna assume that maybe it's healthier for you since it's green.

00:40.891 --> 00:42.765
The color can throw you off, but it's actually pretty good.

00:45.261 --> 00:46.369
I can smell it through the bag.

00:46.451 --> 00:47.871
I don't think I can do this one.

00:47.990 --> 00:50.214
No one eats this as a snack.

00:50.426 --> 00:51.687
I don't think I can eat the head.
