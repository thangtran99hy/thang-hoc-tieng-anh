Psy's hit 2012 single "Gangnam Style" has amassed so many views on YouTube that it,...

00:08.309 --> 00:09.359
...well, broke YouTube.

00:09.733 --> 00:11.742
That is, it exceeded the maximum view counter.

00:12.069 --> 00:14.972
According to Youtube, the technology behind its view counter couldn't keep up...

00:15.081 --> 00:16.420
...with the popularity of the pop song.

00:16.917 --> 00:21.118
Quote, "We never thought a video would be watched in numbers greater than a 32-bit integer,..."

00:21.495 --> 00:22.724
"...but that was before we met Psy."

00:23.013 --> 00:26.613
"Gangnam Style has been viewed so many times we had to upgrade to a 64-bit integer."

00:26.930 --> 00:29.217
The "Gangnam Style" YouTube video currently features an Easter egg...

00:29.354 --> 00:30.710
...if you hover over the video's view counter.

00:30.855 --> 00:34.073
When the YouTube video breaks the new 9.2 quintillion limit,...

00:34.287 --> 00:35.197
...we'll be sure to let you know.

00:35.552 --> 00:37.051
I hope it involves cats.

00:37.343 --> 00:39.499
