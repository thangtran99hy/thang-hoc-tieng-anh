'Twas the season for all to gather and decorate...

00:09.187 --> 00:12.372
...as family and friends cluster to celebrate.

00:12.801 --> 00:15.752
But when decorating your tree this holiday season,...

00:16.520 --> 00:19.805
...use these safety tips with good reason.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.852
Choose a tree that is fresh and green...

00:23.587 --> 00:26.551
...and water it daily to maintain its sheen.

00:27.170 --> 00:29.553
Use only lights with the "UL" mark...

00:30.125 --> 00:33.525
...and follow the instructions to prevent a spark.

00:34.019 --> 00:36.769
And never have your tree near a heat source...

00:37.307 --> 00:40.715
...because a tree fire would be devastating, of course.

00:40.949 --> 00:44.519
Use these tips this November and December...

00:45.119 --> 00:48.372
...for a magical holiday to always remember.
