00:02.547 --> 00:06.991
So you may be thinking, "How does Santa get around the whole world in one night?"

00:07.539 --> 00:12.011
Let's say that Santa needs to visit every one of the two billion children in the world.

00:12.661 --> 00:14.631
The average home has two and a half children,...

00:14.981 --> 00:18.202
...so that means he has to visit around 800 million homes.

00:18.870 --> 00:21.807
Because it becomes night at different times all around the globe,...

00:22.030 --> 00:25.166
...he actually has 48 hours to deliver all the presents.

00:25.425 --> 00:30.201
So that means he needs to get to around five houses every single second.

00:30.673 --> 00:36.284
The most likely explanation is that he uses an antimatter rocket on the back of his sleigh.

00:37.157 --> 00:39.750
Antimatter has the opposite charge to normal matter.

00:40.163 --> 00:43.753
And when they combine together, they create a huge explosion of energy,...

00:44.946 --> 00:47.949
...blasting the sleigh forward at nearly the speed of light.

00:49.191 --> 00:51.873
NASA is studying this to use in their rocket engines,...

00:52.138 --> 00:54.790
...but it looks like Santa has already beaten them to it.
