00:01.811 --> 00:02.205
Yes!

00:02.796 --> 00:03.991
Let the holiday season begin.

00:04.457 --> 00:05.422
I'm on the roof, you're in the attic.

00:05.629 --> 00:07.697
Hon, I can't even tie my shoes at this point.

00:07.883 --> 00:10.379
Okay, I'll tie your shoes, I'll go to the attic and I'm on the roof.

00:13.072 --> 00:13.820
How's it going up there?

00:14.150 --> 00:14.997
Do you have enough lights?

00:15.336 --> 00:17.393
Yeah, I don't know if we have enough roof.

00:17.844 --> 00:19.660
You think a little more snow would make it look real?

00:20.100 --> 00:21.330
Okay, so a full blizzard?

00:26.460 --> 00:28.185
Hey, don't eat the decorations.

00:28.755 --> 00:29.197
You're supposed to be helping.

00:29.653 --> 00:30.025
I am.

00:30.316 --> 00:31.133
I'm making a fire.

00:33.014 --> 00:34.573
Well, that might be too close to the tree, huh?

00:34.980 --> 00:35.107
Ready?

00:35.682 --> 00:35.886
Ready.

00:37.487 --> 00:39.129
Oh, it's beautiful.

00:39.651 --> 00:41.276
You know what this gets me in the mood for.

00:42.221 --> 00:43.196
Oh, absolutely.

00:44.382 --> 00:46.009
I can watch this a thousand times.

00:46.447 --> 00:47.479
Me too.
