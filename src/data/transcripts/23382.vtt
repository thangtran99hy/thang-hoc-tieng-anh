Today, we're gonna make a keg out of a watermelon.

00:05.783 --> 00:09.195
Place a nice-sized watermelon on a flat surface and remove the top.

00:09.485 --> 00:11.495
Now, cut in deep and loosen up the fruit inside,...

00:11.705 --> 00:14.596
...then with a large spoon, scoop out most of the insides,...

00:14.777 --> 00:18.222
...leaving just enough to help flavor whatever beverage you decide to put inside.

00:18.596 --> 00:21.006
After we have the melon hollowed out, it's ready to tap.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.394
And then we'll get our beverages going.

00:22.927 --> 00:26.227
Cut a hole about half the size of the tap directly into the watermelon.

00:26.828 --> 00:28.820
Pop it out with your finger and clear out any fruit.

00:29.375 --> 00:31.011
Be careful not to make it too large,...

00:31.177 --> 00:33.297
...as you want it to be a very tight fit to form a seal.

00:33.683 --> 00:37.013
After the hole was ready, I took my valve and slowly worked it into the melon.

00:37.781 --> 00:38.783
Looks like we're ready to go.

00:39.781 --> 00:42.313
Fill up the watermelon with lots of ice to keep things chilled...

00:42.772 --> 00:44.417
...and then pour beverage of your choice.
