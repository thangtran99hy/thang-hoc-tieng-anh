00:01.211 --> 00:04.917
Time is a tool you can put on a wall or wear it on your wrist.

00:05.383 --> 00:07.399
The past is far behind us.

00:07.589 --> 00:09.185
The future doesn't exist.

00:09.969 --> 00:10.769
What's the time?

00:10.830 --> 00:11.852
It's quarter to nine.

00:12.097 --> 00:13.557
Time to have a bath.

00:14.267 --> 00:15.205
What do you mean?

00:15.289 --> 00:16.294
We're already clean.

00:16.358 --> 00:18.457
Scrub, scrub, scrub till the water's brown.

00:18.573 --> 00:20.656
Time is a ruler to measure the day.

00:20.763 --> 00:22.917
It doesn't go backwards, only one way.

00:23.038 --> 00:25.107
Watch it go round like a merry-go-round,...

00:25.235 --> 00:27.300
...going so fast like a merry-go-round.
