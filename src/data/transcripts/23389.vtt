00:01.242 --> 00:03.257
140. Just another number, right?

00:03.469 --> 00:04.108
Think again.

00:04.302 --> 00:06.307
It could mean all sorts of bad things.

00:06.655 --> 00:07.633
Swimming is great.

00:07.809 --> 00:11.114
But swimming with 140 sharks is a bad idea.

00:11.322 --> 00:14.338
Drinking 140 proof alcohol might harm your health.

00:14.461 --> 00:16.601
It's also flammable at room temperature.

00:17.259 --> 00:19.749
Ever been on a bus with 140 school children?

00:19.948 --> 00:21.662
You could be scarred for life.

00:22.665 --> 00:26.172
Gain 140 pounds and get ready for serious health problems.

00:26.309 --> 00:27.937
And you might need a new scale.

00:28.420 --> 00:31.056
140 is too much of a lot of things.

00:31.314 --> 00:33.345
And it's too high for blood pressure.

00:33.578 --> 00:36.941
A blood pressure reading of 140/90 or higher...

00:37.211 --> 00:39.692
...means you're more likely to have a stroke or heart attack.

00:40.365 --> 00:46.166
