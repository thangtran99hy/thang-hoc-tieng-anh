00:00.141 --> 00:03.334
This is your life, nobody else's.

00:03.912 --> 00:07.119
No matter how much the society, your parents,...

00:07.620 --> 00:11.041
...your friends want you to live, the way they want you to live,...

00:11.393 --> 00:12.823
...you run the show.

00:13.159 --> 00:17.097
This is your life, you're in control.

00:17.650 --> 00:21.421
You got to do what feels right in your heart.

00:21.760 --> 00:24.299
But greatness ain't about being cool,...

00:24.647 --> 00:29.945
...and great men or women would never fit in, 'cause they stand out.
