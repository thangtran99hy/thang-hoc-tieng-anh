ï»¿Why do we gossip?

00:07.677 --> 00:08.291
Good question.

00:08.999 --> 00:10.851
We gossip 'cause we have nothing better to do.

00:10.971 --> 00:11.843
Make time pass.

00:12.276 --> 00:12.933
Why do we gossip?

00:13.321 --> 00:15.491
I think to feel better about ourselves...

00:15.575 --> 00:20.282
...and to attach ourselves to the other person that we're gossiping with.

00:20.867 --> 00:26.494
It makes people feel better to talk about other people's damage and brokenness.

00:26.856 --> 00:29.578
When people gossip about me, it's hurt my feelings...

00:29.691 --> 00:32.825
...and I didn't wanna get hurt and I don't wanna hurt other people.

00:33.197 --> 00:37.297
It's talking about someone in no way or shape or form helps you or helps them,...

00:37.586 --> 00:40.013
...but if you talk to the person as opposed to talking about them,...

00:40.268 --> 00:41.333
...you actually get somewhere.
