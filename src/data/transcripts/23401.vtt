00:00.269 --> 00:03.543
We are in a film studio in Turkey, in Istanbul.

00:04.107 --> 00:06.391
We are shooting a feature film here now.

00:07.089 --> 00:10.330
My last film, it's called "Winter Sleep."

00:10.569 --> 00:11.559
It's about humans.

00:13.059 --> 00:16.297
It's a drama set in the Middle Anatolia.

00:16.481 --> 00:21.404
We finished the location shoots and now we are in the studio section, the last part.

00:21.749 --> 00:26.320
On location, we spent about two months and another month here in the studio.

00:27.066 --> 00:29.607
We shot it in the Cappadocia in the winter time.

00:29.984 --> 00:36.926
There are many kinds of landscapes, humanscapes and portraits and many kind of images...

00:37.011 --> 00:40.139
...sometimes in snow, sometimes in cloudy weather,...

00:40.302 --> 00:44.969
...sometimes more seldomly in the sunny images as well.
