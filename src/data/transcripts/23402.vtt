00:02.348 --> 00:04.644
Kayla Montgomery, a high school senior, is considered to be...

00:04.737 --> 00:07.843
...one of the country's fastest long distance runners in her age group.

00:08.150 --> 00:09.650
She also has multiple sclerosis.

00:09.818 --> 00:11.776
And when a race ends, she collapses to the ground.

00:12.324 --> 00:15.169
Incredibly, the same MS that leaves her unable to remain standing...

00:15.293 --> 00:18.539
...at the end of a race, could be what helps make her race times so good.

00:19.146 --> 00:20.725
It blocks the pain receptors in her brain,...

00:21.065 --> 00:23.146
...so when most runners begin to feel pain and slow down,...

00:23.375 --> 00:24.887
...Montgomery can keep sailing along.
