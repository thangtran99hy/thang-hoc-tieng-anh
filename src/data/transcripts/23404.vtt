Miss Nunez is a really great teacher.

00:03.429 --> 00:05.001
She's always there to help you.

00:05.985 --> 00:07.721
I've had to have some surgery.

00:07.864 --> 00:11.305
My first thought was, "I'm not gonna be here for the week of finals."

00:11.459 --> 00:14.216
"So if they had a question, I wouldn't even be here to answer it."

00:14.733 --> 00:16.521
I'm like, "Everybody, just calm down."

00:16.613 --> 00:18.993
"I've come to a conclusion on how to fix this."

00:22.053 --> 00:23.941
Good morning ladies, how are you guys doin'?

00:24.577 --> 00:28.584
The interaction and the rapport that I build with the kids: that's what gives me my passion.

00:28.708 --> 00:29.945
That's what gives me my drive.
