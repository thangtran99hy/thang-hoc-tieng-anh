00:00.173 --> 00:02.211
Taking a trip on an airplane anytime soon?

00:02.522 --> 00:05.946
A new computer simulation shows just how far sneeze particles...

00:06.029 --> 00:07.945
...travel in a crowded airplane cabin.

00:08.111 --> 00:12.766
Engineers simulated the airflow to show how a sneeze spreads in the enclosed space...

00:12.885 --> 00:15.206
...to help public health officials better understand...

00:15.287 --> 00:18.278
...and potentially combat airborne infectious diseases.

00:18.529 --> 00:23.153
The engineers identified the zone most likely to be infected by a nearby sneezer.

00:23.488 --> 00:24.167
The good news?

00:24.340 --> 00:27.729
Researchers say the risk of catching something isn't as high as you think.

00:27.985 --> 00:30.591
While it's certainly possible to get sick from another passenger,...

00:30.730 --> 00:34.717
...it doesn't happen nearly as often as it could, given the high volume of air traffic.
