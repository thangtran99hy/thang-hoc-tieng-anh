ï»¿I am 106 years old and I know a lot about life.

00:07.100 --> 00:10.200
I want to tell the world what I have learned.

00:11.048 --> 00:13.439
Learn from your mistakes.

00:14.000 --> 00:14.487
Be strong.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.268
Always tell the truth.

00:16.614 --> 00:21.391
Keep your eyes open and sometimes your mouth shut.

00:24.736 --> 00:25.817
Don't complain.

00:26.837 --> 00:27.513
Don't be afraid.

00:27.975 --> 00:29.647
Don't always do what you're told to do.

00:30.504 --> 00:32.397
Put the pedal to the metal.

00:33.253 --> 00:34.827
Live fast.

00:35.622 --> 00:39.743
And never ever forget where you came from.
