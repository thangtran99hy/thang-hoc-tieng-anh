To my ten-year-old self Caroline.

00:06.047 --> 00:08.043
Things are a little rough for you right now.

00:08.270 --> 00:10.139
I know it's lonely where you are, but don't worry.

In ten years, you're gonna be even more awesome.

You're gonna travel the world and meet a lot of really cool people.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.871
Every year you are alive will be better than the one that came before.

Remember that it's always going to turn out alright.

00:21.581 --> 00:23.251
You're going to be proud of who you are one day.
