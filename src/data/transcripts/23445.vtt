With temps fluctuating, it looks like it's officially cold season.

00:03.678 --> 00:06.480
But there are foods that can help you boost your immunity.

00:06.654 --> 00:07.852
Load up on the garlic.

00:08.177 --> 00:11.172
These cloves may have an odor but they contain a sulfuric compound...

00:11.271 --> 00:13.318
...that provides the body with antioxidants.

00:13.501 --> 00:15.277
They'll help defend against colds.

00:15.392 --> 00:18.769
Sweet potatoes are in season and they're loaded with beta-carotene,...

00:18.981 --> 00:21.623
... a compound our bodies convert into Vitamin A,...

00:21.758 --> 00:23.821
...which helps keep a strong immune system.

00:24.085 --> 00:28.927
Although blueberries aren't really in season, these are also powerful antioxidants.

00:29.096 --> 00:30.774
And I love Brazil nuts.

00:30.945 --> 00:34.023
Not only are they delicious but they are high in protein and nutrients...

00:34.125 --> 00:36.269
...that help your immune system function properly,...

00:36.403 --> 00:38.819
...guarding you against infections and the flu.

00:39.029 --> 00:41.485
So eat well to ward off sickness.
