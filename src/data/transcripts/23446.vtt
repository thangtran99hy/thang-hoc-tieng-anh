This bike path is in the Netherlands.

00:02.515 --> 00:04.969
It's called the Van Gogh-Roosegaarde Bicycle Path.

00:05.208 --> 00:07.469
It is based on the "Starry Night" painting,...

00:07.569 --> 00:09.069
...the one that we're all so very familiar with.

00:09.151 --> 00:10.424
Have you ever seen this painting online?

00:10.488 --> 00:11.242
I'm sure you have.

00:11.737 --> 00:13.741
It's a one-kilometer long section of a route...

00:13.813 --> 00:16.519
...that goes through the province where Van Gogh was born and raised.

00:16.634 --> 00:19.317
So it's very near where he was brought up.

00:19.876 --> 00:20.694
It is extremely bright.

00:20.787 --> 00:22.329
So they're coated with special paint...

00:22.415 --> 00:25.943
...and it grabs daylight almost like something that's glow-in-the-dark or solar-powered.

00:26.064 --> 00:26.645
Right.

00:26.962 --> 00:29.469
But this is kind of a cool thing.

00:29.575 --> 00:34.883
There are also extra LEDs along the sides of, parts of the curves of the bike path.

00:34.998 --> 00:40.157
So they help illuminate them when maybe it's overcast...

00:40.321 --> 00:43.434
...and there's not enough energy to actually power these.

00:43.537 --> 00:44.603
It's so beautiful...

00:44.689 --> 00:47.854
...and this is a really great kind of example...

00:47.931 --> 00:51.669
...of how technology can make the world just a prettier place.

00:51.863 --> 00:56.933
What a fantastic and whimsical way of giving people a beautiful, well-lit bike path.
