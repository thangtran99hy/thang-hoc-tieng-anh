Cats love boxes because they're cryptic animals.

00:08.375 --> 00:11.711
They like to hide, and a box gives them a place of safety and security.

00:12.038 --> 00:13.167
They can get into that box...

00:17.415 --> 00:20.969
...and they can't be approached from the side or the back where they're not aware of it.

00:21.224 --> 00:23.372
The other thing is they can sit in that box, feeling safe,...

00:23.471 --> 00:25.499
...and they can watch the world go around in front of them.

00:25.903 --> 00:28.262
And if something interesting comes by, they can dash out.
