Dubai already boasts the world's tallest building,...

00:03.037 --> 00:03.999
...Burj Khalifa,...

00:04.080 --> 00:05.752
...the biggest flower garden,...

00:05.816 --> 00:06.834
...Miracle Gardens,...

00:06.945 --> 00:09.021
...one of the world's largest aquariums;...

00:09.162 --> 00:11.597
...yeah, America's got the title for that one!

00:11.676 --> 00:12.964
Nope, China just beat it.

00:13.069 --> 00:15.596
And now they plan on building the world's biggest mall,...

00:15.700 --> 00:18.286
...and they'll call it, the Mall of the World.

00:18.353 --> 00:20.729
They'll be stealing the title from themselves...

00:20.813 --> 00:24.239
...as they already own the title with the massive Dubai Mall.

00:24.329 --> 00:26.611
But let's put some things into perspective everybody.

00:26.670 --> 00:30.311
The Mall of America in Minnesota is 4.87 million square feet.

00:30.401 --> 00:33.716
The Dubai Mall is 12.1 million square feet,...

00:33.796 --> 00:40.215
...but the Mall of the World will be a city-sized 48 million square feet,...

00:40.755 --> 00:44.326
...and we literally mean city because it will be an indoor city.

00:44.422 --> 00:46.650
The promenade will be seven kilometers long;...

00:46.719 --> 00:49.751
...eight million square feet will be dedicated to shopping centers,...

00:49.821 --> 00:55.222
...and it will be home to 100 hotels and apartment buildings with over 20,000 rooms.
