00:00.087 --> 00:03.409
ï»¿Russian scientists have found an asteroid the size of a mountain...

00:03.511 --> 00:07.423
...that supposedly crosses the Earth's orbit every three years.

00:07.545 --> 00:10.262
So that plus a lot of time means...

00:12.813 --> 00:13.890
I know this stuff could be heavy,...

00:14.213 --> 00:15.776
...but at least you got to see a watermelon blow up.

00:16.073 --> 00:22.090
As of right now, the rock called "2014 UR116" is not coming right for us,...

00:22.278 --> 00:25.327
...and we're not sure if it would ever actually hit us.

00:25.542 --> 00:27.321
But its discovery is a surprise!

00:27.751 --> 00:31.687
The Russian scientists explained it's really difficult to track these types of objects...

00:31.829 --> 00:34.240
...since we're not sure how their routes will be affected...

00:34.365 --> 00:36.495
...by the gravity of the other planets in our system.

00:36.697 --> 00:40.830
And we're discovering objects, not always this big, every day.
