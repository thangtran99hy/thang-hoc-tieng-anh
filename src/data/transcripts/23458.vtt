Now, for that tent, "The Cave."

00:02.103 --> 00:02.988
That thing was cool.

00:03.442 --> 00:06.061
It has these inflatable geometric support braces...

00:06.168 --> 00:07.755
...that make it look kind of like a spider.

00:08.130 --> 00:09.994
All you have to do is plug in the pump and pump it up.

00:10.727 --> 00:13.342
However, it wasn't quite as easy to set up as it should have been.

00:13.829 --> 00:15.711
The tent has these air valves around the base...

00:15.837 --> 00:17.915
...which are kind of tough to spot when the tent is deflated.

00:18.241 --> 00:20.873
And if you miss one, you just pump forever and never get anywhere.

00:21.483 --> 00:24.393
But after I found and closed all of them, the tent went up with just a few pumps.

00:24.781 --> 00:26.081
So the first time might be a little tough,...

00:26.227 --> 00:28.557
...but once you know what you're doing, The Cave is a great tent.

00:28.758 --> 00:31.130
And it ought to be since it's about 750 dollars.
