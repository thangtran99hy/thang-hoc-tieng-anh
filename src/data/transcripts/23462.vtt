Today, wearable technology is embedded into something.

00:07.417 --> 00:10.220
Whereas long-term, we really have to think about...

00:10.343 --> 00:12.855
...how do you make the fabric itself smart.

00:14.844 --> 00:18.026
For example, think about a garment you don't have to wash.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.780
They can change their shape, their color.

00:21.933 --> 00:27.602
Fabrics that have a metallic coating or yarns that are conductive.

00:28.533 --> 00:35.397
We want to make the actual fiber smart so that through nanotechnology,...

00:35.811 --> 00:38.831
...we can create a textile that can sense.

00:39.732 --> 00:42.685
To me, garments are the node of a digital system.

00:42.805 --> 00:49.271
So, imagine that everything we wear becomes part of a digital environment,...

00:49.375 --> 00:50.316
...a digital network.
