ï»¿I'm Gary.

00:01.383 --> 00:01.945
I'm Allen.

00:02.551 --> 00:05.421
We are the owners and founders of Cereal Killer Cafe.

00:05.776 --> 00:07.664
So we're a speciality cereal cafe...

00:07.767 --> 00:10.814
...and we are selling 120 different cereals from around the world.

00:11.313 --> 00:15.437
And we have 13 different milks and 20 toppings.

00:15.647 --> 00:19.331
I bet on what we wanted today was just to cause a reaction in people...

00:19.415 --> 00:20.454
...and that's exactly what we've done.

00:20.781 --> 00:24.005
We want people to leave whether they leave thinking that was ridiculous.

00:24.284 --> 00:26.673
Leave on a sugar high going "Oh, it's great!"

00:27.362 --> 00:30.233
Then, we want people to leave thinking, "That was ridiculous. I absolutely loved it!"...

00:30.329 --> 00:33.211
...or "That was ridiculous. I absolutely despise it."

00:33.431 --> 00:35.065
Either or that's what we would go for.
