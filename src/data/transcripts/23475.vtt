It's very easy to take roles for financial reasons or for whatever reason,...

00:07.568 --> 00:09.307
...but that's gonna stop for that progression,...

00:09.829 --> 00:12.136
...or that trajectory for you to become a leading man for sure.

00:12.837 --> 00:19.869
Charisma, integrity, talent and being transparent as an actor.

00:20.465 --> 00:23.157
People being able to relate to you on-screen,...

00:23.255 --> 00:26.875
...not being put off or intimidated or offended by you,...

00:27.364 --> 00:28.610
...but being able to relate to you.

00:28.717 --> 00:29.636
And that's hard to do.
