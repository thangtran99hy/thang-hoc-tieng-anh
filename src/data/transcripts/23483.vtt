00:01.612 --> 00:07.002
Imagine you're trapped in a cell with a killer and he asked you to play a game.

00:07.984 --> 00:12.377
Place your finger or the cursor on any of the green squares.

00:13.441 --> 00:15.044
You're going to make four moves.

00:15.436 --> 00:18.733
Each move may involve going across one square or several.

00:19.759 --> 00:23.591
Now move left or right to the nearest pink square.

00:25.174 --> 00:28.307
Now, move up or down to the nearest green square.

00:30.101 --> 00:32.813
Now move diagonally to the nearest pink square...

00:33.481 --> 00:39.075
...and now move either down or to the right to the nearest green square.

00:40.033 --> 00:45.849
If you've chosen any of these squares, the killer is going to let you go free.

00:52.861 --> 00:55.901
Any of these squares are absolutely fine.

00:57.190 --> 01:01.302
But if you've chosen this square, then your time has come.
