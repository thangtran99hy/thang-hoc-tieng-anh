When I'm working, things can get so hectic.

00:02.398 --> 00:05.789
So sometimes, I need to find an easy way to express what's most important to me.

00:06.100 --> 00:08.831
Like with my crew, I use shorthand to tell them what I need...

00:10.015 --> 00:12.065
And when I need to talk directly to my fans...

00:13.067 --> 00:18.583
But the most meaningful shorthand of all, is the one I use when I'm about to drive: #X.

00:18.953 --> 00:21.358
It's an easy way to tell everyone that I'm about to drive.

00:21.524 --> 00:24.063
And I do it every time before I get behind the wheel.

00:24.323 --> 00:27.625
Use #X to pause the conversation before you drive.

00:27.898 --> 00:29.666
Because no text is worth a life.
