Music's a very personal experience.

00:02.204 --> 00:04.471
It means something different to everyone.

00:07.571 --> 00:11.582
The first time I saw the prototype, I was astonished like anyone else...

00:11.652 --> 00:16.561
...because there's something levitating above the surface that doesn't happen in nature.

00:16.689 --> 00:20.879
We're also including the latest technology inside the final version of the OM/ONE.

00:21.331 --> 00:23.132
We're using Bluetooth 4.0....

00:23.318 --> 00:27.935
...which can basically pair with most devices that are out there today.

00:28.275 --> 00:30.497
Another really cool thing about Bluetooth 4.0...

00:30.630 --> 00:33.672
...is that you can stereo pair two OM/ONEs together...

00:33.985 --> 00:37.887
...and it just makes for an incredible audio experience.

00:38.073 --> 00:41.606
There's also a Type 1 microphone in the orb, so you can use it as a speakerphone.

00:41.835 --> 00:44.379
We actually use it all the time for conference calls and meetings.

00:44.659 --> 00:46.456
And the orb has a 15-hour battery life.

00:46.559 --> 00:49.332
So when you take it with you, it requires no recharging.

00:49.705 --> 00:52.479
It truly, truly is a revolutionary piece of hardware.
