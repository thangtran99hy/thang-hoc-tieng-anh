Hello, I'm Maria Madelo with VOA 60 America.

00:07.457 --> 00:12.113
President Barack Obama is proposing new cyber security legislation making it easier...

00:12.207 --> 00:16.895
...for private and public entities to share information with federal officials.

00:17.269 --> 00:20.660
The goal is to prevent cyber threats before they happen.

00:21.179 --> 00:24.041
Mr. Obama said that it is too hard for companies...

00:24.172 --> 00:26.811
...especially those controlling the power grid...

00:27.256 --> 00:29.655
...to share critical security information.

00:30.109 --> 00:34.039
Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to Geneva, Switzerland...

00:34.125 --> 00:40.173
...in a bid to revive stalled talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif...

00:40.525 --> 00:42.753
...regarding Iran's nuclear program.

00:43.240 --> 00:49.593
Kerry said the meeting is a chance for the diplomats to assess where the two sides stand.

00:50.214 --> 00:54.211
An Ohio man with a history of psychiatric illness was arrested...

00:54.325 --> 00:58.067
...for plotting to poison House Speaker John Boehner.

00:58.465 --> 01:03.551
The man was a bartender at an Ohio country club where the Speaker is a member.

01:04.317 --> 01:05.275
That's all for today.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.397
Thanks for watching.
