So, Running Man has a lot of physical things you have to do.

00:04.550 --> 00:07.544
Do you think that will stop you from doing "Running Man" in the future?

00:09.343 --> 00:09.905
I don't know.

00:10.338 --> 00:13.559
Actually, we have a lot of injuries from the TV show "Running Man,"...

00:13.959 --> 00:14.801
...but it's okay.

00:17.308 --> 00:19.025
We can sing on the chair.

00:20.127 --> 00:21.255
So, we don't need to move.

00:21.901 --> 00:23.119
We don't need to walk around.

00:23.215 --> 00:23.793
In a wheelchair.

00:27.997 --> 00:32.585
Because "Running Man" is really good for us to contact our fans...

00:32.975 --> 00:36.527
...and we just wanna make our fans happy and laugh.
