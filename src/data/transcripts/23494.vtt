My name is Ronald Corbin and I am a street photographer.

00:06.508 --> 00:15.244
32 years ago, on January 10th 1980, I became sober.

00:19.031 --> 00:21.741
I'm the proverbial fly on the wall with a camera.

00:23.349 --> 00:25.765
I photograph what I see, okay.

00:26.287 --> 00:29.351
And what I see is not always beautiful.

00:30.767 --> 00:38.221
I love to shoot people that people turn a blind eye to when they walk down the street.

00:38.998 --> 00:41.337
Like, "I don't want to look at that."

00:41.533 --> 00:43.923
Well, I want to throw that in your face...

00:44.187 --> 00:46.693
...because this is what is out there.

00:51.625 --> 00:53.680
This was my life's goal.

00:53.843 --> 00:55.479
I am far from wealthy.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.884
I live paycheck to paycheck, hand-to-mouth,...

00:59.058 --> 01:07.285
...but at least I hope in some small way it has some meaning to other people.
