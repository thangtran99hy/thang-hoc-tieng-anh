When an employee is crying at work, your main goals are:...

00:03.571 --> 00:04.713
...One: discretion.

00:05.549 --> 00:08.258
Don't change what you're doing, only what you're saying.

00:08.778 --> 00:10.776
Don't call any attention to the employee.

00:12.356 --> 00:13.874
And two: understanding.

00:14.942 --> 00:18.818
With your words and actions, make them feel like it's normal to be emotional.

00:20.739 --> 00:22.784
Never try to stop someone from crying.

00:24.545 --> 00:27.738
No hugs, but stay professional.

00:28.460 --> 00:29.798
Composure is important.

00:31.389 --> 00:33.023
Ask if they would like to talk later.

00:34.639 --> 00:36.950
If they want to talk now, let them.

00:37.911 --> 00:38.626
And listen.

00:40.461 --> 00:41.662
No, really, listen.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.140
Okay, you can stop listening now.

00:50.707 --> 00:52.079
Seriously, say something.
