00:10.049 --> 00:13.071
Flying through the night, I watch over this world.

00:13.464 --> 00:14.709
A silent guardian.

00:15.237 --> 00:16.681
A watchful protector.

00:17.302 --> 00:18.512
A dark knight.

00:18.800 --> 00:19.512
I'm...

00:22.544 --> 00:24.295
Okay fine, so I'm not Batman.

00:24.437 --> 00:25.214
I'm just a bat.

00:25.667 --> 00:28.632
But like Batman, I'm often misunderstood.

00:28.768 --> 00:31.358
People think I'm scary, strange and dangerous.

00:31.869 --> 00:35.429
If they only knew my story though, I'd be cheered as a hero.

00:35.645 --> 00:38.131
Vampire bats can be a great help to humans.

00:39.129 --> 00:42.944
A chemical known as desmoteplase found in vampire bat's saliva...

00:43.200 --> 00:47.923
...helps break down blood clots and is being tested by recovering stroke victims.

00:49.435 --> 00:54.617
Of the remaining thousand plus species of bats, about 70% feed on insects.

00:54.887 --> 00:58.533
These bats help control the real vampires: mosquitoes,...

00:58.677 --> 01:03.939
...whose nasty bites are not just annoying, but spread diseases like West Nile Virus.

01:04.298 --> 01:07.093
Batman might want to keep his identity secret,...

01:07.306 --> 01:10.905
...but a great way to help real bats is by continuing to learn about them...

01:11.149 --> 01:13.944
...and spreading the truth that they are real heroes...

01:14.887 --> 01:17.738
...even if their good deeds are often unseen.
