00:00.772 --> 00:04.562
So tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals...

00:04.797 --> 00:08.388
...and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us.

00:09.222 --> 00:10.538
It begins with our economy.

00:10.726 --> 00:16.281
We've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds,...

00:16.654 --> 00:18.261
...a stock market that has doubled...

00:18.336 --> 00:21.480
...and health care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years.

00:24.137 --> 00:25.282
So the verdict is clear.

00:27.079 --> 00:29.020
Middle-class economics works.

00:30.033 --> 00:32.183
Expanding opportunity works.

00:33.360 --> 00:37.690
And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don't get in the way.

00:38.627 --> 00:41.820
So what does middle-class economics require in our time?

00:44.245 --> 00:49.457
First, middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure...

00:50.047 --> 00:51.735
...in a world of constant change.

00:53.182 --> 01:00.044
That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement.

01:01.761 --> 01:06.008
Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road,...

01:07.124 --> 01:09.890
...we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills.

01:10.735 --> 01:13.123
Finally, as we better train our workers,...

01:13.219 --> 01:17.408
...we need the new economy to keep churning out high wage jobs for our workers to fill.

01:19.898 --> 01:22.409
I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership.

01:24.467 --> 01:28.229
We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy.

01:29.409 --> 01:34.479
First, we stand united with people around the world who've been targeted by terrorists...

01:34.627 --> 01:36.868
...from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris.

01:37.979 --> 01:42.480
Second, we're demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy.

01:44.503 --> 01:48.278
We're upholding the principle that bigger nations can't bully the small...

01:49.231 --> 01:52.935
...by opposing Russian aggression and supporting Ukraine's democracy...

01:53.079 --> 01:55.205
...and reassuring our NATO allies.
