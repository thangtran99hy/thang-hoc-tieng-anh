Do you always get to sit with the winner of Korean American Idol?

00:04.775 --> 00:06.306
'Cause if that's the case, I'm coming.

00:06.546 --> 00:08.761
I think a lot of girls would come too, right?

00:10.655 --> 00:12.456
Now, you live in Korea obviously.

00:12.587 --> 00:12.877
Yeah.

00:13.343 --> 00:13.601
Yes?

00:13.747 --> 00:13.933
Right.

00:14.333 --> 00:15.860
But born and raised in Chi-town.

00:16.059 --> 00:16.465
Exactly.

00:16.567 --> 00:17.077
Yay.

00:17.193 --> 00:19.006
Is there any way we could get you to sing for us?

00:20.493 --> 00:20.875
Yeah.

00:21.060 --> 00:23.345
My favorite song karaoke is Bad Romance.

00:23.501 --> 00:23.745
Uh-huh.

00:23.859 --> 00:24.333
By Lady Gaga.

00:24.464 --> 00:24.921
Yes.
