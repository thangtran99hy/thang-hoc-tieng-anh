...when prosecutors in South Korea indicted the company's CEO, Travis Kalanick,...

00:10.252 --> 00:13.786
...on the grounds that the service violates the country's transportation law.

00:13.901 --> 00:17.862

00:18.015 --> 00:20.111
...and those of its competitors are unsafe...

00:20.252 --> 00:22.946
...and violate a law that bans rental car operators...

00:23.018 --> 00:25.951
