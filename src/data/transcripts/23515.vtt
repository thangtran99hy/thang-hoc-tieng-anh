Our number one biggest snub of the 2015 Oscars: The Lego Movie!

00:05.802 --> 00:08.441
The fan favorite was not only expected to get nominated...

00:08.527 --> 00:12.914
...but was actually a front-runner to win on many people's Oscar ballot this year.

00:13.110 --> 00:16.757
Instead, the Academy decided to nominate two lesser-known films:...

00:16.857 --> 00:20.796
Song of the Sea from Belgium and The Tale of Princess Kaguya from Japan.

00:21.157 --> 00:24.577
At least The Lego Movie was somewhat vindicated last night...

00:24.680 --> 00:28.242
...taking home the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Film.
