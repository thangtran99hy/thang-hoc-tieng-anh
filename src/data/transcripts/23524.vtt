00:00.140 --> 00:01.826
We're all moving so fast.

00:02.229 --> 00:05.481
What if, just for a moment, we stopped.

00:12.070 --> 00:15.733
There are problems with everything and nothing's yet perfect,...

00:16.153 --> 00:18.778
...but that shouldn't be cause to bemoan.

00:19.489 --> 00:21.095
That should be cause to achieve.

00:21.391 --> 00:24.461
We're living at an all-time high for health and wellness,...

00:24.911 --> 00:28.428
...and literacy has been sharply on the rise for decades.

00:29.222 --> 00:30.883
More people are living longer.

00:31.349 --> 00:35.009
And during childbirth, both infant and maternal mortality rates...

00:35.083 --> 00:39.282
...have plummeted in the last century, saving the lives of millions.

00:39.585 --> 00:43.803
We live the way we do because people chose to tackle their problems head-on.

00:44.466 --> 00:47.298
When thinking if you're going to be optimistic this year, remember:...

00:47.879 --> 00:50.141
...nobody changes the world on their own.

00:53.105 --> 00:54.826
It all starts with a resolution.

00:55.695 --> 00:56.409
What's yours?
