00:00.255 --> 00:03.194
So one day, we decided to take a little trip to the beach.

00:03.681 --> 00:06.298
You know, it was just a regular day, it wasn't too sunny.

00:06.664 --> 00:08.860
Eliana has always been afraid of the water.

00:09.459 --> 00:11.083
I thought there were sharks in the water.

00:12.739 --> 00:15.517
Your sister was like, "Just jump in the water and see what happens."

00:15.935 --> 00:16.625
"You're gonna be fine."

00:16.813 --> 00:20.827
So, Eliana, she goes in the water and she panics like crazy.

00:22.929 --> 00:25.829
But eventually she starts getting braver and...

00:26.000 --> 00:28.169
...at one point, she was even playing in the water.

00:28.580 --> 00:31.220
She finally started seeing that she was gonna be okay.

00:31.526 --> 00:33.882
And she hasn't been scared of water since then.
