ï»¿A lot of people who, I think will relate to this song...

00:06.755 --> 00:10.614
...are people who are dealing with not ever really feeling cool with themselves...

00:10.691 --> 00:13.774
...because other people make them feel like they don't fit in.

00:14.185 --> 00:17.311
One thing I learned in this whole process is,...

00:17.771 --> 00:21.289
...is you can get everything you want in life without ever feeling like you fit in.

00:22.721 --> 00:27.967
Selling millions of records doesn't make me feel cool, it makes me feel proud...

00:28.050 --> 00:30.931
...and I have a lot of people on my side and I've worked really hard but...

00:32.547 --> 00:35.931
...I don't think it's the most important thing in life to fit in.

00:36.155 --> 00:41.857
I think it's the most important thing in life to dance to the beat of your own drum...

00:42.596 --> 00:46.597
...and to look like you're having more fun than the people who look cool like they fit in.
