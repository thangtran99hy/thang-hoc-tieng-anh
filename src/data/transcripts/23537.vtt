Dear kitten, you see how some of the humans are wearing traditional robes of some sort.

00:05.325 --> 00:08.471
I can't tell what they signify in terms of status.

00:08.803 --> 00:11.267
But I am pretty sure that one is the idiot.

00:11.846 --> 00:14.184
The humans seem to have some sort of a ritual.

00:14.662 --> 00:16.483
When the light box suddenly gets loud,...

00:16.575 --> 00:20.813
...all of the humans try to be the first to jump up and shout louder than anyone else.

00:21.299 --> 00:23.623
The person who gets up the fastest is the winner...

00:23.752 --> 00:26.048
...and gets to hit people with his paws.

00:26.405 --> 00:30.653
The slowest people to get up are then taunted for their inadequacies...

00:30.819 --> 00:32.231
...and they become very sad.

00:32.423 --> 00:34.063
It's actually quite a cruel game.

00:34.576 --> 00:35.708
But it's a cruel world.

00:36.101 --> 00:40.237
If you can find someone who sneezes every time you get near them, get near them.

00:40.697 --> 00:43.913
And when it's time, you just walk right in front of the light box...

00:43.972 --> 00:46.329
...and sit down like you don't know what's going on...

00:46.679 --> 00:50.530
...and then 3, 2, 1, that's right.

00:50.739 --> 00:52.039
Kitty get an airplane ride.

00:52.329 --> 00:55.471
A little private jet to the only prize worth competing for.

00:55.585 --> 00:57.770
A can of moist, delicious wet food.

00:58.255 --> 00:59.399
And touchdown.

01:00.525 --> 01:01.448
Works every time.

01:03.107 --> 01:04.655
Kitty gets what he wants.
