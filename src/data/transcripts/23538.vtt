That daily habit we call eating may seem like a simple fact of life.

00:06.937 --> 00:09.848
But the way we bring food to our plates is changing faster than ever.

00:10.031 --> 00:13.299
Believe it or not, today's youngest adults are preparing more food at home...

00:13.433 --> 00:15.719
...than their parents ever have, thanks to the Internet.

00:15.951 --> 00:19.827
And twenty-four seven food delivery is also driving this explosion of home chefs.

00:20.273 --> 00:24.490
This phenomenon is rapidly changing the rules about how food is marketed and sold.

00:24.845 --> 00:26.396
We're seeing that small market items,...

00:26.569 --> 00:30.691
...products that were once relegated to specialty stores are now moving front and center.

00:30.859 --> 00:32.753
But there's more to it than health concerns.

00:32.983 --> 00:35.919
Millennials have a taste for complex flavors and local charm...

00:36.116 --> 00:39.081
...which has led to a 14-billion-dollar craft beer market.

00:39.424 --> 00:41.360
And artisanal trends don't stop there.

00:41.609 --> 00:45.029
Popular smoked foods like bacon will be even bigger in 2015.

00:45.271 --> 00:49.829
Don't be surprised if smoked flavors show up in vegetables, chocolate or cocktails too.
