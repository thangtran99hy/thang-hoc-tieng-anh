I have some breathtaking video this morning that you have to see.

00:02.600 --> 00:07.897
This is from Slovakia, where two hikers discovered a frozen lake so crystal clear,...

00:08.284 --> 00:10.675
...it appeared that they were walking on water.

00:10.765 --> 00:11.915
Isn't that amazing?

00:12.238 --> 00:13.680
Look, you can see the rocks down below.

00:13.759 --> 00:16.544
Well, turns out, snowy conditions forced the hikers...

00:16.645 --> 00:18.601
...to abandon their planned route in the mountains,...

00:19.043 --> 00:23.405
...so instead they hiked down that stunning, beautiful lake below.

00:23.487 --> 00:26.111
That is a detour worth taking there.
