Hey dad, who is that man?

00:02.451 --> 00:03.187
He's our broker.

00:03.425 --> 00:04.626
He helps look after all our money.

00:07.085 --> 00:07.857
Do you pay him?

00:08.849 --> 00:09.302
Of course.

00:10.165 --> 00:10.727
How much?

00:11.037 --> 00:12.036
I don't know exactly.

00:13.326 --> 00:14.334
What if you're not happy?

00:14.609 --> 00:15.773
Does he have to pay you back?

00:15.955 --> 00:16.249
Nope.

00:16.609 --> 00:17.100
Why not?

00:18.527 --> 00:19.391
It doesn't work that way.

00:19.859 --> 00:20.467
Why not?

00:21.737 --> 00:24.956
Are you asking enough questions about the way your wealth is managed?

00:25.976 --> 00:28.250
Wealth management at Charles Schwab.
