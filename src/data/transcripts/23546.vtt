What is the greatest contribution of your country to the entire world?

00:04.270 --> 00:08.575
I feel like the contribution is just that we have a wonderful influence on the world,...

00:08.649 --> 00:11.497
...and we can always help other countries if they need our help.

00:11.729 --> 00:13.430
And we can give back as much as we can.

00:14.301 --> 00:19.826
I'm born and raised in Amsterdam, and Amsterdam is one of the most tolerant cities of the world.

00:22.731 --> 00:27.659
A lot of art and history and I'm very proud of it, thank you.

00:32.064 --> 00:35.143
So now, we have a very difficult situation in our country.

00:40.667 --> 00:43.969
And right now the very most important contribution...

00:52.895 --> 00:58.534
...is to direct all of our energies to support our army and our people.

00:58.703 --> 01:05.224
As we all know, we have the home to the legendary Usain Bolt, Bob Marley,...

01:05.731 --> 01:08.966
...who have contributed such great music to this world,...

01:09.173 --> 01:13.679
...and we have the fastest man alive who has been trailblazing the Jamaican flag.

01:13.783 --> 01:15.235
Thank you so much.

01:21.376 --> 01:26.275
I believe that my country has been an example to be followed by the rest of the countries.

01:34.113 --> 01:38.073
We are persevering people no matter what obstacle we have in our way,...

01:38.259 --> 01:41.907
...and we continue fighting for that which we want to accomplish...

01:49.611 --> 01:52.178
...notwithstanding many difficulties we have gone through.

01:52.324 --> 01:56.257
Today, we are world leaders in many different matters.

02:00.569 --> 02:05.013
And I am quite proud to represent it before all of you.
