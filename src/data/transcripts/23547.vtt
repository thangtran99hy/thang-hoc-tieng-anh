00:04.823 --> 00:11.713
Seventy years on, 300 elderly survivors gathered before Auschwitz-Birkenau's gate of death.

00:12.067 --> 00:16.496
This is where the trains came, to a camp where over a million were killed:...

00:16.824 --> 00:18.643
...the vast majority Jews,...

00:18.797 --> 00:24.009
...but also Roma, homosexuals, Polish dissidents and Soviet prisoners of war.

00:24.560 --> 00:28.151
This is the last anniversary with so many living witnesses.

00:28.679 --> 00:32.911
Outside, the railway sidings where selection took place,...

00:33.174 --> 00:36.139
...to work as slaves or to be gassed.

00:37.233 --> 00:40.084
Wreaths were laid against the wall where prisoners were shot.

00:40.404 --> 00:45.055
Those that could paid tribute to families and friends wiped out.

00:45.665 --> 00:47.863
This anniversary will be the last one...

00:48.105 --> 00:51.787
...in which a significant number of survivors will be present.

00:51.879 --> 00:52.995
And there is a concern,...

00:53.523 --> 00:59.095
...that without living witnesses, keeping the memories alive of what happened here...

00:59.620 --> 01:04.723
...and the lessons it teaches us and future generations will be much harder.
