ï»¿Hi there.

00:03.547 --> 00:06.434
I've had a lot of people ask me how I wash my hair in space...

00:06.920 --> 00:09.225
...and I thought I'd show you how I do it.

00:09.640 --> 00:12.271
What I like to do is start by just putting some hot water,...

00:13.092 --> 00:14.524
...squirting it onto my scalp.

00:16.606 --> 00:19.039
And I have a mirror here so I can kinda watch what I'm doing.

00:23.097 --> 00:24.728
Sometimes the water gets away from you,...

00:26.099 --> 00:27.723
...and you try and catch as much as you can.

00:28.848 --> 00:33.365
Then I just work the water up through to the ends of my hair.

00:36.131 --> 00:40.243
Then I take my no rinse shampoo and squirt it also on the scalp...

00:40.982 --> 00:41.603
...just a little bit.

00:43.146 --> 00:43.680
And rub it in.

00:44.661 --> 00:45.761
There, I think that's pretty good.

00:45.895 --> 00:48.847
And now as my hair dries, as the water evaporates from my hair,...

00:49.537 --> 00:51.661
...it will become humidity in the air...

00:51.757 --> 00:56.135
...and then our air conditioning system will collect that into condensate.

00:56.366 --> 00:59.513
And it won't be long and our water processing system...

00:59.965 --> 01:01.093
...will turn that into drinking water.
