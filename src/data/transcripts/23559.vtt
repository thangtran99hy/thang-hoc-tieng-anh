At Central Elementary in Union, Missouri, the best teachers may just be two students.

00:06.236 --> 00:10.506
First graders Vincent Butterfield and Zac Gossage are very good friends.

00:10.621 --> 00:13.478
Last June, after feeling ill and tired for weeks,...

00:13.824 --> 00:17.325
...Zac was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

00:17.575 --> 00:21.744
Still, while everybody around him took it hard, Zac took it in stride.

00:21.827 --> 00:25.897
As for Vincent, he started asking questions and learning about cancer.

00:26.034 --> 00:31.372
Vincent also found out that Zac might lose his hair because of the chemotherapy treatments.

00:31.463 --> 00:36.044
One day, he showed up to Mrs. Koester's first grade class wearing a stocking cap.

00:36.212 --> 00:37.634
"I have a surprise for Zac."

00:37.723 --> 00:38.976
And I said, "Well, you do."

00:39.131 --> 00:42.288
And he pulls off his stocking cap and here I see that he shaved his head.

00:42.371 --> 00:43.311
"I cut it off."

00:43.935 --> 00:44.983
"You cut off your hair?"

00:45.386 --> 00:45.559
"Yeah."

00:45.643 --> 00:45.961
"How come?"

00:47.097 --> 00:52.029
"To make Zac feel like he's not the only one without any hair."

00:52.291 --> 00:58.341
And Vincent, well he may be young, but he's teaching us the oldest lessons.

00:59.025 --> 00:59.849
What is friendship?

01:00.545 --> 01:01.700
"A beautiful thing."

01:02.117 --> 01:03.344
Indeed it is.
