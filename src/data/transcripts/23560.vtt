Hello there.

00:03.623 --> 00:05.849
What have you got your wife today?

00:06.376 --> 00:09.597
It's the 14th, Valentine's Day!

00:10.323 --> 00:11.908
You better get her something good.

00:12.119 --> 00:16.336
Some nice flowers at least or she'll know you forgot.

00:18.995 --> 00:20.954
You can't be serious!

00:21.451 --> 00:22.993
She'll know!

00:26.534 --> 00:28.064
That's still not good enough.

00:28.694 --> 00:30.215
And they smell of petrol.

00:30.830 --> 00:32.313
She'll know!

00:36.266 --> 00:38.081
You wouldn't dare!

00:38.347 --> 00:39.936
She'll know!

00:41.315 --> 00:43.273
Why not try the florists.

00:43.431 --> 00:48.160
It might be last minute, but they are used to dealing with men like you.

00:54.541 --> 00:56.235
Look at those.

00:58.592 --> 01:02.809
Now when you tell her you love her, she'll know!
