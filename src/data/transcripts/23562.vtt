Introducing PrintSnap.

00:11.200 --> 00:14.137
The PrintSnap camera brings back the excitement of instant pictures.

00:16.714 --> 00:22.859
Simply load, flip and shoot.

00:30.454 --> 00:31.821
Within a few short seconds,...

00:31.985 --> 00:35.990
...you'll have a photo that you can share with your friends or post to your wall.

00:36.890 --> 00:40.793
Just like digital pictures, PrintSnap photos can be easily edited and cropped.

00:41.161 --> 00:42.424
And if you're worried about privacy,...

00:42.517 --> 00:45.241
...rest assured that PrintSnap photos are easy to delete securely.

00:46.809 --> 00:48.098
If you like Instagram filters,...

00:48.234 --> 00:50.943
...there are dozens of great filters that are compatible with PrintSnap.

00:51.160 --> 00:52.419
You can even make your own.

00:56.077 --> 01:01.547
And with its optional time-lapse add-on, you can take stunning time-lapse videos.

01:06.495 --> 01:09.339
Because the PrintSnap uses low-cost thermal paper for printing,...

01:09.448 --> 01:11.731
...each exposure costs just three tenths of a cent.

01:12.761 --> 01:14.115
And it doesn't use any ink.

01:16.132 --> 01:18.201

...PrintSnap can take hundreds of pictures on a single charge.
