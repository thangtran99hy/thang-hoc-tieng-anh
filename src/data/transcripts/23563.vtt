00:02.143 --> 00:03.828
Interesting seating choice, sir.

00:04.465 --> 00:07.103
Why did he sit next to me when there are all these empty chairs?

00:07.480 --> 00:08.843
This definitely means something.

00:08.964 --> 00:10.223
You know what this meeting is about?

00:10.933 --> 00:12.825
Yeah, I prepared a little bit.

00:13.879 --> 00:14.450
Hey, Chris!

00:14.879 --> 00:15.661
Come on, sit over here.

00:16.099 --> 00:17.408
Whatever, I'm super busy.

00:21.199 --> 00:22.487
He's always touching me.

00:23.887 --> 00:24.159
Hey!

00:25.077 --> 00:26.237
Ned was looking for you.

00:26.546 --> 00:26.719
Oh?

00:26.851 --> 00:27.091
Yeah.

00:27.481 --> 00:29.743
He's finally ready to tell me his true feelings.

00:29.978 --> 00:32.048
I think he just wanted you to e-mail him notes on that meeting.

00:33.098 --> 00:33.562
Oh, okay.

00:34.232 --> 00:37.589
I bet he planned his exit so it would be at the same time as me.

00:37.993 --> 00:39.788
That's so romantic!

00:40.817 --> 00:41.422
You're walking this way?

00:41.618 --> 00:41.751
Yeah!

00:42.047 --> 00:42.411
Nice.
