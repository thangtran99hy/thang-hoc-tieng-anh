In 1998, a paper in a major medical journal proposed a link between autism...

00:04.529 --> 00:06.705
...and the vaccination for measles, mumps and rubella.

00:06.933 --> 00:08.855
The popular press and some celebrities...

00:08.969 --> 00:11.764
...fueled anxiety about vaccinations based on this report.

00:12.187 --> 00:17.057
In fact, over a dozen studies have failed to find any connection between autism and vaccines...

00:17.178 --> 00:21.565
...and that original paper was retracted amid allegations of fraud and conflicts of interest.

00:21.819 --> 00:25.211
Yet the actions of celebrities and the media can have a lasting effect.

00:25.447 --> 00:29.415
More than half of Americans still suspect there's a link between vaccines and autism.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.443
The consequences can be serious.

00:31.588 --> 00:34.241
In Ireland, vaccinations dropped about 30%,...

00:34.356 --> 00:38.715
...resulting in 1500 new cases of measles and mumps, including three deaths.

00:39.006 --> 00:41.492
And in the US, states with lower vaccination rates...

00:41.573 --> 00:45.903
...are currently experiencing outbreaks of measles and epidemic levels of whooping cough.

00:46.139 --> 00:47.851
So don't be immune to good advice;...

00:48.031 --> 00:50.599
...better a sore bottom, than a deadly bottom line.
