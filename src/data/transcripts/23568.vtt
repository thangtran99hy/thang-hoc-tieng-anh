I think Taylor, as a musician, as a person and as an entity,...

00:04.809 --> 00:08.615
...is one of the biggest exports from the United States of America,...

00:08.884 --> 00:13.443
...so to have her seal of approval enough to take me on tour for six months with them...

00:13.686 --> 00:16.193
...you know, instrumental to me breaking the States.

00:16.935 --> 00:20.351
I'd been over to the States a lot, I'd had a bit of success there...

00:20.469 --> 00:25.018
...but just having that stamp of approval took me from a theatre artist to an arena artist...

00:25.111 --> 00:29.328
...and took me from a one-hit to a household name.

00:29.541 --> 00:34.099
If someone has aims, dreams and aspirations to become a superstar,...

00:34.511 --> 00:38.771
...she'd be the best example of it,...

00:38.889 --> 00:40.040
...of how to keep it together.
