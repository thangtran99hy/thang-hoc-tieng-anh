00:08.749 --> 00:10.676
...Australia selects the kangaroo.

00:11.043 --> 00:11.405

Brazil selects the sloth.

00:15.134 --> 00:17.717
United States selects wheat.

Wheat.

00:19.766 --> 00:21.945
Madagascar selects lemur.

00:22.429 --> 00:24.256
China: Ginkgo biloba.

00:24.759 --> 00:26.457

Beach, beach, beach, beach.

00:42.081 --> 00:42.946

00:43.837 --> 00:44.114
I love it.

00:44.187 --> 00:45.461

00:45.596 --> 00:46.658
Rich volcanic soil.

00:46.736 --> 00:47.425
Perfect weather.

00:47.500 --> 00:50.849

...since the beginning of time.
