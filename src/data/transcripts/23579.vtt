00:01.718 --> 00:03.093
Marcia, what happened?

00:03.275 --> 00:05.021
Peter hit me in the nose with a football.

00:05.148 --> 00:06.613
I can't go to the dance like this.

00:06.981 --> 00:08.976
Well, I'm sure it was an accident, sweetheart.

00:09.049 --> 00:10.015
An eye for an eye.

00:10.244 --> 00:11.473
That's what dad always says.

00:11.869 --> 00:12.667
I never said that, honey.

00:12.753 --> 00:13.341
Shut up!

00:13.861 --> 00:15.232
It's time to teach Peter a lesson.

00:15.339 --> 00:16.710
Marcia, eat a Snickers.

00:16.834 --> 00:17.392
Why?

00:17.687 --> 00:19.659
You get a little hostile when you're hungry.

00:20.535 --> 00:20.820
Better?

00:21.409 --> 00:21.787
Better.

00:22.136 --> 00:23.577
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.

00:23.674 --> 00:25.002
Jan, this isn't about you.

00:25.242 --> 00:26.116
It never is!
