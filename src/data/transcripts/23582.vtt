Pierce, I'm so glad you're here because I got a role that is perfect for you, man.

00:03.737 --> 00:05.836
Don't tell me. Action adventure.

00:05.870 --> 00:06.437
Sort of.

00:06.535 --> 00:08.393
All right, picture this: we open on you.

00:09.043 --> 00:12.353
You're driving in a beautiful car up a snowy mountain road.

00:12.464 --> 00:13.149
You're going...

00:13.244 --> 00:14.133
200 miles an hour?

00:15.905 --> 00:17.135
No, 30.

00:18.825 --> 00:19.483
What's the mission?

00:19.595 --> 00:20.476
There is no mission.

00:20.565 --> 00:21.259
Top secret, huh?

00:21.657 --> 00:22.470
Yeah, sort of.

00:22.581 --> 00:25.163
So you keep going towards the summit, your destination,...

00:25.271 --> 00:27.287
...and there it is: a cabin.

00:28.866 --> 00:30.151
And it explodes.

00:30.629 --> 00:32.674
What? No, it's just a cabin.

00:33.041 --> 00:33.900
No explosions?

00:34.219 --> 00:37.699
No explosions, but there are fireworks.

00:37.907 --> 00:40.111
Oh, I like fireworks.
