The real question that needs to be asked, as well as answered...

00:08.583 --> 00:16.433
...is, "What is it that we can do that is unique; that is impactful?"

00:17.833 --> 00:21.255
When Bray was 11 months old he was fitted for his first pair of prosthesis.

00:23.479 --> 00:25.839
We're going to empower every individual...

00:26.366 --> 00:30.493
...and every organization to do more and achieve more.

00:31.617 --> 00:35.431
We use Microsoft technology to analyze Braylon's gait mechanics.

00:36.815 --> 00:44.503
It's this process of continuous renewal of showing courage in the face of reality...

00:45.255 --> 00:49.252
I think the technology has changed Braylon's life by opening up the world for him.

00:52.437 --> 00:56.378
Showing that courage in the face of opportunity.
