ï»¿I'm Julie Charlton and I'm a wheelchair racer.

00:03.607 --> 00:07.381
I was born with spina bifida which means I spend most of my time in a wheelchair.

00:09.119 --> 00:12.110
In 2012, I was introduced to wheelchair racing.

00:13.039 --> 00:16.039
Wheelchair racing has helped me boost my self-confidence...

00:16.203 --> 00:20.196
...and helped me feel more positive and more happy in general.

00:20.735 --> 00:22.233
After winning multiple championships...

00:22.487 --> 00:24.484
...and being the recent Junior Athlete of the Year,...

00:24.934 --> 00:27.365
...I have my sights set on Rio in 2016.
