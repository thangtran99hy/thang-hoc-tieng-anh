Bill, this is a big day for Microsoft with Windows 10.

00:03.433 --> 00:06.515
Are you finding yourself checking your phone?

00:07.153 --> 00:11.831
How does it feel when you see your former company go through a day like today...

00:12.015 --> 00:14.725
...and a bit of a resurgence over there in many ways?

00:15.226 --> 00:20.005
Yeah, Satya Nadella, the new CEO has been in charge about a year now.

00:20.743 --> 00:21.348
It's exciting.

00:22.258 --> 00:26.507
He's taking the company, having an embrace and lead on some new areas...

00:27.529 --> 00:31.223
...that's got some influence on the new products that are coming out there.

00:32.326 --> 00:34.325
He's had me come in and consult with some of the groups.

00:34.409 --> 00:35.579
So it's exciting.

00:36.012 --> 00:39.117
I think it's not just a one day thing and the months ahead...

00:39.193 --> 00:40.642
...as we see how developers react...

00:40.738 --> 00:43.653
...as we get out later this year on the product they're shipping.

00:44.525 --> 00:49.481
Windows is core and so the breakthrough things they've done there,...

00:51.107 --> 00:52.531
...I'm excited to see the reaction.
