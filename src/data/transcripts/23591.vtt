00:00.321 --> 00:02.241
Onto Venezia.

00:02.851 --> 00:07.963
The city of winding canals, secret alleys and mystery,...

00:08.576 --> 00:17.207
...but the average tourists here only sees this: people, more people and more people.

00:17.677 --> 00:20.633
You can easily feel like you're in a herd of cattle.

00:20.937 --> 00:22.113
Moo!

00:22.698 --> 00:26.603
And if you break away, be prepared to get lost.

00:27.003 --> 00:28.583
Of course, there is Romans here.

00:28.838 --> 00:30.747
It is Italia after all.

00:31.198 --> 00:34.693
But your view of the Veneto might be obstructed by this.

00:36.573 --> 00:40.191
And as for coming with young kids, stairs and carriages?

00:40.795 --> 00:41.690
Not a good mix.

00:42.154 --> 00:43.077
Not romantic.

00:43.498 --> 00:45.277
You might end up splitting up.

00:45.779 --> 00:50.855
So, unless you're going to stay far away from Piazza San Marco...

00:50.937 --> 00:56.629
...and take some serious time to explore Venice, I'm afraid, you are busted.
