ï»¿My wife Julie and I are medical students and we got married last year.

00:03.902 --> 00:06.385
When you talk about soul mates, that's Julie for me.

00:07.039 --> 00:07.967
Hey, can you come outside?

00:08.371 --> 00:08.605
I'm here.

00:09.867 --> 00:10.581
What is this?

00:10.721 --> 00:13.504
We wanted to have some nice dates together and we haven't had time...

00:13.631 --> 00:16.965
...so I planned this really amazing day for her...

00:17.037 --> 00:19.141
...and I just hope she has a really big surprise.

00:19.277 --> 00:20.665
They prepared a special meal for us.

00:21.101 --> 00:22.197
I'm so excited.

00:22.618 --> 00:22.988
Cheers!

00:23.549 --> 00:24.190
Thank you.

00:27.039 --> 00:30.313
I wanted to tell you I love you very much and I have something for you.

00:30.651 --> 00:31.506
Something very special.

00:31.990 --> 00:34.711
He's always trying so hard to keep me happy.

00:34.830 --> 00:36.227
This was really special.

00:36.751 --> 00:38.843
Every kiss begins with Kay.
