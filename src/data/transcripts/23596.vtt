My name is Ann Bingley Gallops.

00:02.051 --> 00:04.770
I'm the owner of Open Spaces Feng Shui in New York.

00:04.855 --> 00:10.239
I help people create nourishing, inspiring and supportive spaces for their life and work.

00:10.466 --> 00:16.723
I discovered feng shui in the mid 90s when I was going through a hard time in my life.

00:16.927 --> 00:20.608
I started looking around, I discovered feng shui and I thought,...

00:20.816 --> 00:25.156
..."This thing has such a funny name, but it's about your space."

00:25.294 --> 00:29.379
So I thought, "Well, I'll see if my space can actually support my life."

00:29.550 --> 00:32.008
I started putting some of the principles into place,...

00:32.167 --> 00:35.445
...and the more I did that, the better my life became.
