00:07.021 --> 00:08.324
How did we get this far?

00:11.121 --> 00:24.725
Human beings have an immeasurable desire to discover, to invent, to build.

00:30.309 --> 00:34.731
Our future depends on us furthering these ideas.

00:37.501 --> 00:44.675
Our responsibility, it rests on the shoulders of generations to come.

00:52.924 --> 01:00.253
But with every new discovery, there is risk,...

01:03.801 --> 01:09.439
...there is sacrifice and there are consequences.
