ï»¿Thank you so much!

00:05.560 --> 00:08.094
I just want to say, first of all, thank you to the Academy...

00:08.167 --> 00:10.703
...and to Stephen Fitzmaurice who I forgot in my last one.

00:12.081 --> 00:14.511
...I just want to say that before I made this record,...

00:14.587 --> 00:17.808
...I was doing everything to try and get my music heard.

00:17.871 --> 00:21.837
I tried to lose weight and I was making awful music...

00:21.921 --> 00:28.069
...and it was only until I started to be myself that the music started to flow and people started to listen..

00:28.211 --> 00:32.033
So thank you guys for accepting me for being just me.

00:32.167 --> 00:32.543
Thank you.
