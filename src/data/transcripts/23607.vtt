00:00.132 --> 00:03.945
So, how would you describe your feelings without using the word "love?"

00:04.337 --> 00:05.901
Without using the word "love?"

00:10.235 --> 00:11.855
When they say that two become one?

00:12.451 --> 00:13.394
We've really done that.

00:13.575 --> 00:16.191
And that just says it all.

00:17.698 --> 00:19.483
He's part of me.

00:20.175 --> 00:21.370
He really is part of me.

00:22.282 --> 00:26.337
I can't imagine myself without him, which is scary but real.

00:27.058 --> 00:28.561
She is everything.

00:29.798 --> 00:33.045
I can tell that he loves me because I can see it in his eyes,...

00:33.187 --> 00:36.781
...and I can tell in the way we talk to each other, the way we relate to each other.

00:37.297 --> 00:39.373
What do you see in his eyes when you look at each other?

00:39.847 --> 00:42.789
I see me in his eyes.

00:44.775 --> 00:47.601
I'm grateful for what you do and I'm grateful for who you are.

00:48.699 --> 00:52.485
When all is said and done and all the music is gone and the noise is gone,...

00:52.560 --> 00:57.214
...and the conversations are gone, there's still that bond between us.

00:57.359 --> 01:00.296
And that's the best way I can describe it.
