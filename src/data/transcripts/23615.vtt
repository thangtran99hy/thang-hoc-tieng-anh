I live in Brooklyn, New York.

00:08.581 --> 00:11.944
I am Cuban/Nicaraguan and I work in book publishing.

00:13.010 --> 00:15.011
I love taking pictures when I travel,...

00:15.178 --> 00:20.106
...and it's incredibly important to capture all the moments that you're seeing.

00:21.169 --> 00:24.184
Whenever I come back from a trip, I check all of my photos...

00:24.281 --> 00:29.309
..and what's really exciting about Google Stories is that it kind of creates a memory,...

00:29.656 --> 00:31.515
...sometimes better than I remember it.

00:33.456 --> 00:39.024
In Europe, that was the first time I really felt the exhilaration you feel when you travel.

00:39.553 --> 00:42.263
In Paris, I kissed Oscar Wilde's grave.

00:42.630 --> 00:48.396
It's covered in like pink and red lips and I knew that I wanted my lip to be on there too.

00:50.139 --> 00:53.275
When I travel, I feel like the ultimate version of myself.

00:53.498 --> 00:57.759
It's about not holding yourself back, being excited and wanting to see everything...

00:57.853 --> 01:00.904
...and just really understanding what it means to be alive.
