The first time I saw the campus was...

00:01.988 --> 00:02.777
It was incredible.

00:03.083 --> 00:07.176
There's volleyball nets and colorful umbrellas and you see people walking their dogs.

00:07.545 --> 00:08.853
It feels kind of like a playground.

00:09.093 --> 00:10.148
A big playground.

00:11.721 --> 00:15.736
The atmosphere around Google is definitely very eccentric but also very academic.

00:16.052 --> 00:19.587
At Google, we actually do have the ability to make more of an impact on people...

00:19.683 --> 00:22.775
...and more of a change in one year than many people do in their lifetimes.

00:23.352 --> 00:27.113
It's an environment in which very few limitations are placed on...

00:27.239 --> 00:29.109
...where your mind can be during the day.

00:31.113 --> 00:32.629
You're all starting your teams this week,...

00:33.015 --> 00:35.706
...and some great advice is to not be afraid to fail.

00:36.252 --> 00:39.132
But we wanna flip that around a little bit and say, "Don't be afraid to succeed."
