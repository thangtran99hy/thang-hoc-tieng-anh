We all love a trip down to our local cafe, cups of tea,...

00:04.204 --> 00:06.125
...a bit of cake and some sheep.

00:06.872 --> 00:07.827
Yes, sheep.

00:08.135 --> 00:12.660
A little cafe in South Korea has its own unique way of attracting new people,...

00:13.071 --> 00:15.611
...two sheep that can be petted by customers.

00:17.467 --> 00:20.971
According to the lunar calendar, February 19th this year...

00:21.033 --> 00:23.021
...marks the start of the year of the sheep...

00:23.419 --> 00:25.188
...and the young couple at the cafe said...

00:25.262 --> 00:28.952
...it was a convenient alternative to visiting a sheep ranch.

00:30.150 --> 00:33.747
The owner of the cafe said he opened up in 2011...

00:34.049 --> 00:36.092
...but the place has never been busier.

00:37.351 --> 00:42.701
In South Korea, the sheep symbolizes kindness, humility and respect for parents.
