ï»¿Who did this?

00:03.429 --> 00:04.383
Remember Owen Shaw?

00:05.528 --> 00:06.731
This is his big bad brother.

00:08.312 --> 00:09.896
He's a special forces assassin.

00:10.664 --> 00:11.653
They created a monster.

00:13.031 --> 00:15.216
Looks like the sins of London have followed us home.

00:16.691 --> 00:17.531
We're being hunted.

00:20.261 --> 00:23.077
Shaw lives in a world that doesn't play by your rules.

00:24.357 --> 00:27.073
Like it or not, you and your friends are a part of it now.

00:27.781 --> 00:28.963
I don't have friends.

00:31.483 --> 00:32.365
I got family.

00:35.663 --> 00:38.171
This time it ain't just about being fast.

00:42.752 --> 00:45.297
Can somebody just walk me through what we're supposed to be doing?

00:48.246 --> 00:49.811
Yo, Roman, you need some fresh air?

00:52.241 --> 00:54.192
Just when you didn't think it could get any better, huh?
