When you think about how you experience technology today, it's like behind this glass screen.

00:05.265 --> 00:06.611
And you're kind of stuck.

00:06.707 --> 00:07.786
It feels cold.

00:09.013 --> 00:10.699
We've unlocked the screen.

00:12.634 --> 00:17.647
Really what we're trying to do is break down the walls between technology and people.

00:18.597 --> 00:21.501
It's basically a see-through display that you wear.

00:21.807 --> 00:25.881
And it lets you see holograms in your world, in your space all around you.

00:27.311 --> 00:33.911
The ability to draw with your hand or to take an asset, an image and move it or scale it.

00:34.005 --> 00:36.461
It's a very natural way of interacting with it.

00:38.096 --> 00:40.577
Here's what you can do with holographic video.

00:41.116 --> 00:46.186
Here's what you can do with using your world as a game level.

00:46.819 --> 00:53.226
Here's what you can do with taking the power of 3D modeling and creation.

00:54.001 --> 00:54.593
And guess what?

00:54.685 --> 01:00.153
Point it out of the screen into real 3D, and then sharing what you've created with others.
