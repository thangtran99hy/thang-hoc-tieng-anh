What did you do during the war?

00:03.677 --> 00:05.181
I worked in a radio factory.

00:05.462 --> 00:06.885
What did you really do during the war?

00:08.680 --> 00:09.950
Welcome to Enigma.

00:10.130 --> 00:14.161
I'm designing a machine to break every German message instantly.

00:14.379 --> 00:15.559
What is it that we're doing?

00:15.671 --> 00:18.493
We're going to break an unbreakable Nazi code and win the war.

00:24.996 --> 00:29.011
You'll never understand the importance of what I'm creating here!

00:29.137 --> 00:30.878
Our patience has expired.

00:31.787 --> 00:34.513
Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of...

00:35.457 --> 00:39.901
...who do the things that no one can imagine.
