Authentic love does not silence, shame or abuse.

00:07.873 --> 00:13.085
If you're in a relationship with someone who does not honor and respect you,...

00:13.365 --> 00:17.541
...I want you to know that you are worthy of love.

00:18.077 --> 00:20.154
Please reach out for help.

00:20.439 --> 00:22.665
Your voice will save you.

00:22.932 --> 00:24.844
Let it extend into the night.

00:25.139 --> 00:26.763
Let it part the darkness.

00:26.989 --> 00:30.669
Let it set you free to know who you truly are:

00:31.094 --> 00:34.871
valuable, beautiful, loved.
