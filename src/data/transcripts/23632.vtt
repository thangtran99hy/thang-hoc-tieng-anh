Contact lenses have been a revolution for many people.

00:07.972 --> 00:11.111

00:20.465 --> 00:24.597
Well, now they can, thanks to the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.

00:24.967 --> 00:28.483
The organization has developed lenses with a three times optical zoom,...

00:28.896 --> 00:33.131
...allowing the users to focus in on hard-to-spot details with eagle-eyed precision.

00:33.825 --> 00:36.751

00:36.837 --> 00:39.995
...which activate or deactivate the zoom, and for the moment,...

00:40.141 --> 00:44.139
...they're only good enough to aid the eyesight of people with degenerative conditions.
