00:01.545 --> 00:01.827
ï»¿Alright.

00:02.250 --> 00:03.539
I'm gonna figure this out right now.

00:06.584 --> 00:08.943
Okay, step 1: Physical contact.

00:09.246 --> 00:10.591
Do they ever touch or hit you?

00:11.025 --> 00:11.483
Yes!

00:11.757 --> 00:14.061
That's a thing she does like a lot.

00:14.609 --> 00:17.908
Usually, when I've said something hilarious, which is all the time.

00:18.521 --> 00:22.237
But, I've seen her doing it to other people like this one time with this guy Jonathan.

00:23.275 --> 00:24.575
Okay, that doesn't prove anything.

00:24.897 --> 00:26.438
2. Acting Differently.

00:26.745 --> 00:31.137
Well, how do I know what she's like when I'm not around if I'm never there to see it?

00:32.855 --> 00:33.991
Oh, there's this one thing.

00:35.211 --> 00:37.281
When I say something unexpectedly hilarious,...

00:37.611 --> 00:41.768
...she seems to purposely not laugh and kind of avoids looking at me.

00:42.865 --> 00:43.555
That's something, right?

00:44.226 --> 00:45.999
Number 3: Familiarity.

00:46.283 --> 00:48.127
Do they share personal information with you?

00:48.677 --> 00:50.052
Do they trust you with secrets?

00:50.449 --> 00:50.865
Yeah!

00:51.498 --> 00:53.033
She tells me weird secrets all the time.

00:53.455 --> 00:56.558
Sometimes, I don't even know why she tells me them but she does.

00:56.925 --> 00:57.861
This is looking good.

00:58.107 --> 01:00.033
Okay, number 4: Body Language.

01:00.377 --> 01:03.130
Sometimes, she ignores me altogether.

01:04.041 --> 01:06.551
Moving on, number 5: Special Attention.

01:06.835 --> 01:08.810
Do they take interest in your interests?

01:08.929 --> 01:11.661
Oh, this one time she got me my favorite kind of candy.

01:12.207 --> 01:14.133
I mean, this isn't any kind of candy either.

01:14.401 --> 01:16.773
You have to go to a specific part of the city to get it because...

01:17.335 --> 01:19.227
...they don't even make this kind of candy in America.

01:19.447 --> 01:21.269
That has to mean she likes me a little bit, right?

01:21.616 --> 01:25.901
And if she likes me a little, it's enough to ask her if she could like me a lot.

01:28.777 --> 01:32.519
Or I could be wrong and I could ruin a perfectly good friendship...

01:32.856 --> 01:34.640
...and regret it forever.
