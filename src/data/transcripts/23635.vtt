00:00.611 --> 00:01.216
What's up, guys?

00:01.694 --> 00:04.126
Ready to join Dom and I on our adventure in Korea?

00:05.451 --> 00:08.063
Welcome to the heart and soul of Korea.

00:08.659 --> 00:11.730
The only thing I was looking forward to was this.

00:12.247 --> 00:15.277
Let me show you how Korea shows their hospitality.

00:15.578 --> 00:21.545
You get a nail file, cotton pads, toothbrush and toothpaste with mouthwash...

00:21.778 --> 00:23.800
...long hair must-have, they hooked it.

00:25.040 --> 00:29.163
Whenever I'm visiting a new country, I like to try their traditional food.

00:29.774 --> 00:31.204
They gave us lotus tea to start.

00:31.758 --> 00:33.601
It was so good.

00:39.355 --> 00:43.157
We decided to hit up one of the most famous districts in Korea.

00:43.607 --> 00:44.591
Can you guess?

00:48.977 --> 00:50.474
Yup, Gangnam.

00:53.373 --> 00:57.707
Like Beverly Hills or Fifth Avenue, this is the place to shop and play.

01:00.949 --> 01:03.267
Korea is innovating the beauty space.

01:03.722 --> 01:06.658
Their products and formula are unique and forward-thinking.

01:07.843 --> 01:11.177
We spent the entire afternoon sampling everything.
