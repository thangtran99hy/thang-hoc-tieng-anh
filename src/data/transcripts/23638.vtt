00:00.889 --> 00:03.880
Looking to January, comparable sales are expected to be negative...

00:03.975 --> 00:06.455
...due in part to the shift in Chinese New Year...

00:06.843 --> 00:09.477
...and consumer perception issues in Japan.

00:11.612 --> 00:15.163
The changes we're making are designed to refocus our system on those areas...

00:15.235 --> 00:18.503
...that matter most to our customers today and for the future.

00:19.839 --> 00:22.626
And that starts with deepening our relationship with customers...

00:22.702 --> 00:25.212
...to increase relevance, drive traffic...

00:25.456 --> 00:27.823
...and position McDonald's for longer-term growth.

00:28.788 --> 00:31.283
At the same time, we're strengthening the menu pipeline...

00:31.389 --> 00:34.011
...to create greater choice at the local levels...

00:34.083 --> 00:37.914
...that reflect attributes like taste preferences and demographics...

00:38.611 --> 00:41.184
...and those things that make each market unique.

00:42.791 --> 00:45.231
You'll also see changes in our customer service models...

00:45.311 --> 00:47.933
...as we work to create more memorable experiences...

00:48.288 --> 00:50.619
...and to deliver unparalleled convenience.

00:51.728 --> 00:53.992
We're also strengthening the value proposition.

00:54.963 --> 00:59.079
We're strategically evaluating pricing relationships across the entry-level,...

00:59.278 --> 01:01.245
...core and premium tiers of our menu.

01:01.855 --> 01:05.509
At the same time, we're thinking differently about how to encourage customers...

01:05.889 --> 01:08.335
...to bundle products and use add-on purchases...

01:08.910 --> 01:11.115
...to create a satisfying, affordable meal.

01:13.411 --> 01:16.858
Collectively, these changes create the McDonald's experience of the future,...

01:16.925 --> 01:21.048
...which brings the work that's happening within each strategic priority together...

01:21.172 --> 01:23.954
...to deliver changes our customers will notice.

01:25.036 --> 01:28.437
It builds on the investments we've already made in technology,...

01:28.611 --> 01:31.763
...reimaging our restaurants and operations improvement...

01:32.112 --> 01:36.081
...with an increased emphasis on tangible customer-centric innovations...

01:36.523 --> 01:40.052
...for menu and service to profitably grow the business.
