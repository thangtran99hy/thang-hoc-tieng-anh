You hungry?

00:05.098 --> 00:06.583
I'm starving.

00:07.817 --> 00:08.166
Hello.

00:09.741 --> 00:10.671
We're very lucky.

00:10.852 --> 00:11.679
Yeah, you are.

00:11.840 --> 00:12.740
But you deserve it.

00:12.839 --> 00:14.235
You're both such lovely people.

00:16.431 --> 00:17.957

This is Tom and Gerri.

00:19.593 --> 00:19.933
Hello.

00:20.195 --> 00:21.683
Tom and Gerri, that's brilliant!

00:28.305 --> 00:29.678
This is for you, Tom.

00:29.812 --> 00:31.113
Buenos Aires!

00:31.195 --> 00:32.054
Yeah, 'cause I thought...

00:32.149 --> 00:34.883
...but oh, you went there, didn't you, the two of you, Argentina?

00:35.032 --> 00:36.198
No, I didn't, no.

00:36.753 --> 00:37.395
Didn't you?

00:39.993 --> 00:41.401
Eat, drink, be merry.

00:41.558 --> 00:43.205
It was lovely having your dinner cooked for you.

00:43.901 --> 00:46.330
You don't really bother when you're by yourself, do you? I don't, anyway.

00:46.690 --> 00:48.273
He was a good-looking man when he was young.

00:48.365 --> 00:48.732
Was he?

00:50.654 --> 00:52.025
Life's not always kind, is it?

00:52.539 --> 00:53.444
Oh, the baby!

00:53.509 --> 00:54.635
Oh, you have a baby!

00:54.706 --> 00:55.817
Yeah, I'm sorry, Tanya.
