Now, sometimes when people are trying to decide whether a word is good or bad,...

00:14.021 --> 00:15.083
...they don't really have a good reason.

00:15.150 --> 00:17.352
So they say something like, "Because grammar!"

00:17.943 --> 00:19.447
But that makes no sense to me.

00:19.648 --> 00:20.403
Words are great.

00:20.646 --> 00:21.903
We should have more of them.

00:22.144 --> 00:25.479
I want you to make as many new words as possible.

00:26.246 --> 00:31.055
And I'm gonna tell you six ways that you can use to make new words in English.

00:31.539 --> 00:33.180
The first way is the simplest way.

00:33.589 --> 00:35.551
Basically, steal them from other languages.

00:39.462 --> 00:43.117
Linguists call this borrowing, but we never give the words back,...

00:43.245 --> 00:45.661
...so I'm just gonna be honest and call it stealing.

00:46.743 --> 00:49.979
We usually take words for things that we like, like delicious food.

00:50.085 --> 00:53.535
We took "kumquat" from Chinese, we took "caramel" from French.

00:53.806 --> 00:56.543
We also take words for cool things like "ninja," right?

00:56.617 --> 00:57.709
We took that from Japanese,...

00:57.934 --> 01:00.693
....which is kind of a cool trick 'cause ninjas are hard to steal from.

01:03.427 --> 01:06.560
So, another way that you can make words in English...

01:06.679 --> 01:09.627
...is by squishing two other English words together.

01:09.732 --> 01:10.976
This is called "compounding."

01:11.341 --> 01:12.863
Words in English are like Lego:...

01:12.967 --> 01:15.527
...if you use enough force, you can put any two of them together.

01:18.583 --> 01:20.480
We do this all the time in English.

01:20.574 --> 01:25.720
Words like "heartbroken," "bookworm," "sand castle," all are compounds.

01:25.817 --> 01:29.316
Another way that you can make words in English is kind of like compounding,...

01:30.263 --> 01:34.484
...but instead you use so much force when you squish the words together...

01:34.989 --> 01:36.564
...that some parts fall off.

01:36.859 --> 01:41.807
So these are blend words, like "brunch" is a blend of "breakfast" and "lunch."
