ï»¿It's our time to have wage equality once and for all...

00:04.649 --> 00:08.559
...and equal rights for women in the United States of America.

00:08.716 --> 00:09.261
Wow!

00:12.107 --> 00:12.830
This Oscar...

00:16.077 --> 00:22.145
This belongs to all of those people around the world battling ALS.

00:22.483 --> 00:31.200
I read an article that said that winning an Oscar could lead to living five years longer.

00:33.336 --> 00:36.493
If that's true, I'd really like to thank the Academy...

00:36.585 --> 00:38.313
...because my husband is younger than me.

00:39.540 --> 00:45.210
Maybe next year the government will inflict some immigration rules to the Academy.

00:46.150 --> 00:47.131
Two Mexicans in a row?

00:47.219 --> 00:48.442
That's suspicious, I guess.
