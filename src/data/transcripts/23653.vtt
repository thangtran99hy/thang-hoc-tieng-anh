00:00.986 --> 00:04.349
Scientists, technologists, innovators, they're just like you.

00:04.511 --> 00:06.140
They love trying things.

00:06.431 --> 00:07.411
Uncertain things.

00:07.497 --> 00:08.451
Ambitious things.

00:08.910 --> 00:11.647
Things that sound as crazy in our heads as they do out loud.

00:11.863 --> 00:14.168
Those are the things that make us get up, brush our teeth,...

00:14.330 --> 00:16.318
...and go risk our reputation on a hunch.

00:17.930 --> 00:21.297
Trying something new is the only way to make the next great, whatever!

00:22.502 --> 00:25.015
And the best part is we all know how to do it.

00:25.411 --> 00:28.456
When you were a baby you unsuccessfully tried that new walking thing,...

00:28.600 --> 00:32.000
...for like, four months, and now you walk like a champion.

00:32.723 --> 00:34.948
Same with talking, swimming, riding a bike,...

00:35.737 --> 00:38.360
..the desire to try new things is built into you.

00:39.343 --> 00:43.788
Now take that desire, apply some science, and get ready to change the world.

00:45.757 --> 00:47.187
What will you try?
