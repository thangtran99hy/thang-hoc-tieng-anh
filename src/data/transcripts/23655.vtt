00:00.537 --> 00:01.606
ï»¿This is my mom.

00:01.744 --> 00:02.585
I love her.

00:02.980 --> 00:06.101
But during the holiday season, she gets a little chaotic.

00:08.140 --> 00:09.464
Merry Christmas.

00:09.884 --> 00:10.224
Why?

00:10.295 --> 00:10.768
Simple.

00:11.268 --> 00:13.386
She's in charge of getting the presents.

00:13.589 --> 00:19.440
For me, my sister, my brother, my dad, my grandma, grandpa, aunts and my uncles...

00:19.505 --> 00:20.930
...and so on and so on.

00:21.491 --> 00:23.718
She was always leaving herself notes.

00:24.118 --> 00:30.375
On the table, on the refrigerator, in the living room and even on her laptop.

00:31.388 --> 00:33.970
But this year, something is very different.

00:34.070 --> 00:39.852
Now when she sees something for us, she would use her new phone to just select...

00:39.929 --> 00:43.161
...select, select, select and select again.

00:44.314 --> 00:46.641
This way, everything is in one place.

00:46.747 --> 00:47.100
Boom!

00:47.311 --> 00:48.232
Right on her phone.

00:48.512 --> 00:49.329
Cool, right?

00:49.634 --> 00:52.242
She can send it to dad to see what he thinks.

00:52.513 --> 00:53.235
Where's mine?

00:53.362 --> 00:58.437
She can even view her lists on Scrapbook and order her favorites through mobile.

00:59.496 --> 01:00.223
And done.

01:00.628 --> 01:04.833
And that means she can have a peaceful holiday season like the rest of us.

01:04.954 --> 01:07.332
Ready, set, super-duper mom!
