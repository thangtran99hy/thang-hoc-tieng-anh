00:00.668 --> 00:01.059
No!

00:01.223 --> 00:02.713
The truth of the matter is,...

00:03.726 --> 00:04.105
No!

00:04.663 --> 00:06.027
...he's always in a bad mood.

00:06.433 --> 00:10.368
But when he was on his phone and got texts or calls...

00:10.509 --> 00:12.883
...or just about anything else interrupted him,...

00:14.235 --> 00:16.640
...really, really bad mood.

00:17.514 --> 00:19.275
He must be going through puberty.

00:20.177 --> 00:22.317
But lately, I've seen some changes.

00:22.717 --> 00:25.354
He texts with his friends while he's watching soccer.

00:25.582 --> 00:26.734
Amazing, right?

00:27.312 --> 00:31.471
And while he's watching movies, he follows his favorite team on Facebook.

00:32.137 --> 00:35.087
He can search the web while he plays games.

00:37.887 --> 00:39.475
And all that seems to make him happy.

00:40.040 --> 00:40.659
What are you looking at?

00:42.177 --> 00:45.440
Well, it makes him happier than before.

00:46.425 --> 00:48.683
So sometimes he shares his phone with me.

00:50.263 --> 00:52.056
It must be his hormones.

00:54.859 --> 00:56.277
You have a girlfriend?

00:56.665 --> 00:58.775
Ready, set, multiplayer!
