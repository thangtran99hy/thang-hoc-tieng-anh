ï»¿Live long and prosper.

00:03.350 --> 00:05.970
Is there a more famous TV gesture than the Vulcan salute?

00:06.601 --> 00:10.157
Leonard Nimoy, who popularized the gesture in his role as Mr. Spock...

00:10.290 --> 00:14.447
...on the 60s TV series Star Trek, both lived long and prospered...

00:14.959 --> 00:16.595
...before dying at the age of 83.

00:16.769 --> 00:18.359
In an age where the word is overused,...

00:18.959 --> 00:22.421
...a half man, half alien was truly an iconic character:...

00:22.884 --> 00:26.163
...pointy ears, upturned eyebrows, bowl haircut,...

00:26.665 --> 00:29.729
...maddeningly logical, frustratingly dispassionate.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.902
You'd make a splendid computer, Mr. Spock.

00:32.605 --> 00:34.669
He and his fellow Star Trek crew would go on to star...

00:34.733 --> 00:39.177
...in the first of six feature films based on the series, two of which Nimoy directed.

00:43.106 --> 00:45.513
Anyone who's ever been defined by a single accomplishment...

00:45.916 --> 00:49.365
...can understand why Nimoy was at points ambivalent about his legacy.

00:50.124 --> 00:53.840
This was a man who wrote two autobiographies and cheekily titled them...

00:54.369 --> 00:57.390
..."I Am Not Spock" and "I Am Spock."

00:58.525 --> 01:01.101
He appeared in both the Star Trek reboot and its sequel...

01:01.407 --> 01:04.287
...and happily attended fan convention after fan convention.

01:04.621 --> 01:08.975
To paraphrase one of the franchise's most famous, and come on, moving scenes,...

01:09.333 --> 01:12.949
...Leonard Nimoy was and always will be Mr. Spock.

01:16.436 --> 01:20.309
Live long and prosper.
