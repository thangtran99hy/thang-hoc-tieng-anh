Every day, countless documents are printed out.

00:04.077 --> 00:06.576
Yet, can we do it by reusing paper?

00:08.605 --> 00:12.049
The inspiration came from fading doodle pen for kids.

00:13.627 --> 00:17.947
We readjusted the ink formula and used it in printer ink box.

00:20.697 --> 00:23.302
With one simple setting change on the computer,...

00:23.804 --> 00:27.243
...the fading ink gives new life to used paper.

00:28.581 --> 00:32.803
After a few days, the contents on the page disappeared gradually...

00:33.300 --> 00:35.240
...and the paper could be used again.

00:35.991 --> 00:41.590
We printed fading letters so that more people would know about it and start using it.

00:42.532 --> 00:46.295

00:47.053 --> 00:51.375
