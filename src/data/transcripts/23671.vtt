ï»¿Growing up in a family with three generations,...

00:10.033 --> 00:11.934
...I've always been very close to my grandfather.

00:12.395 --> 00:15.613
When I was four years old, my grandfather and I were walking in a park in Japan...

00:15.902 --> 00:17.064
...when he suddenly got lost.

00:17.637 --> 00:20.109
It was one of the scariest moments I've ever experienced in my life,...

00:20.421 --> 00:22.596
...and it was also the first instance that informed us...

00:22.691 --> 00:24.689
...that my grandfather had Alzheimer's disease.

00:25.574 --> 00:28.787
Over the past 12 years, his condition got worse and worse,...

00:29.020 --> 00:32.167
...and his wandering in particular caused my family a lot of stress.

00:33.423 --> 00:35.376
Then one night, about two years ago,...

00:36.374 --> 00:39.348
...I was looking after my grandfather and I saw him stepping out of the bed.

00:39.805 --> 00:41.333
The moment his foot landed on the floor,...

00:41.445 --> 00:44.372
...I thought, "Why don't I put a pressure sensor on the heel of his foot?"

00:45.039 --> 00:46.869
Once he stepped onto the floor and out of the bed,...

00:47.186 --> 00:50.201
...the pressure sensor would detect an increase in pressure caused by body weight,...

00:50.519 --> 00:53.756
...and then wirelessly send an audible alert to the caregiver's smartphone.

00:54.261 --> 00:56.241
That way, my aunt could sleep much better at night...

00:56.475 --> 00:58.671
...without having to worry about my grandfather's wandering.

00:59.234 --> 01:01.220
So now I'd like to perform a demonstration of the sock.

01:03.186 --> 01:05.569
So, once the patient steps onto the floor,...

01:08.533 --> 01:10.307
...an alert is sent to the caregiver's smartphone.

01:12.537 --> 01:13.659
One thing I'll never forget...

01:13.933 --> 01:16.799
...is when my device first caught my grandfather's wandering out of bed at night.

01:17.419 --> 01:20.372
At that moment, I was really struck by the power of technology...

01:20.612 --> 01:21.730
...to change lives for the better.

01:22.507 --> 01:25.941
People living happily and healthily: that's the world that I imagine.

01:26.537 --> 01:27.131
Thank you very much.
