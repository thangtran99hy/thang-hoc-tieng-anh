00:01.373 --> 00:04.105
It's that point when someone became more than just another someone.

00:06.290 --> 00:08.014
When a friendship became official.

00:09.299 --> 00:10.479
Some we knew right away.

00:12.038 --> 00:15.901
Others were discovered slowly, excavated from time spent together.

00:17.530 --> 00:19.164
But it wasn't just a friend request.

00:20.797 --> 00:22.389
We were looking for an accomplice.

00:24.042 --> 00:25.067
A future best man.

00:27.323 --> 00:28.095
A sister.

00:29.573 --> 00:30.664
A choreographer.

00:32.658 --> 00:33.799
An ally in whatever.

00:36.035 --> 00:37.161
Someone to follow.

00:38.904 --> 00:40.831
Sometimes we didn't know what we were getting.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.289
Sometimes that was for the best.

00:45.569 --> 00:47.466
But we knew we wanted to hold onto them.

00:48.265 --> 00:49.476
For whatever reason.

00:50.265 --> 00:54.411
But mostly because we wanted to see what could happen when we became friends.
