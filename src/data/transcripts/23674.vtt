ï»¿First things first, you need fresh water and it needs to be boiling.

00:07.047 --> 00:09.741
But just before the kettle boils, warm the pot.

00:10.270 --> 00:13.911
You see, it's all about having the very best conditions for your tea.

00:14.247 --> 00:18.285
And since temperature is all important, don't let a chilly pot scupper you.

00:19.977 --> 00:22.450
Once emptied, put your tea in the pot.

00:24.261 --> 00:28.007
It may sound daft but if you're making a normal black tea like this,...

00:28.393 --> 00:31.203
...make sure the water is boiling when it hits the tea.

00:31.407 --> 00:34.721
Let the tea sit for between three and five minutes.

00:34.939 --> 00:38.780
We think the flavor peaks once it got down to around 60 degrees.

00:39.265 --> 00:42.800
For what it's worth, we like it with a little milk added up to it...

00:43.013 --> 00:44.368
...and we don't think it needs sugar.

00:45.883 --> 00:47.835
Whichever way, perfect.
