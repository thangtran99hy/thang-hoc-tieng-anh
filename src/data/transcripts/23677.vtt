ï»¿What's up everybody?

00:02.855 --> 00:05.999
I'm here in the kitchen in LA with my older brother, Josh.

00:06.353 --> 00:09.179
It's Chinese New Year and growing up we used to always cook Chinese food...

00:09.261 --> 00:10.283
...then bring it to a potluck.

00:11.335 --> 00:13.695
So, basically what we're going to do is, once we're done cooking this food,...

00:13.779 --> 00:16.808
...we're going to the nearby park, eat the food with some friends,...

00:16.930 --> 00:18.089
...and celebrate Chinese New Year.

00:20.746 --> 00:25.561
A big misconception about celebrities, or whatever, athletes or entertainers...

00:25.641 --> 00:27.387
...is that we have it all together.

00:28.391 --> 00:32.988
And then a big misconception about homelessness or homeless people is that...

00:33.543 --> 00:35.445
...they have nothing, like, together.

00:36.192 --> 00:40.111
People believe that those who are homeless don't want to do better for themselves.

00:40.183 --> 00:42.661
That they don't want to work or don't want to go to school...

00:42.758 --> 00:46.288
...or be closer to their family when, in reality, that's not true at all.

00:46.702 --> 00:49.282
I know, before I ended up on the streets, I kind of thought,...

00:49.413 --> 00:52.619
...well, these people must be all out here because they screwed up.

00:53.100 --> 00:57.558
People shouldn't be so hasty to judge and put people in categories...

00:57.912 --> 01:00.534
...because, what they say, "Never judge a book by the cover."

01:00.735 --> 01:05.162
So, the tradition for Chinese New Year is you always give a red envelope.

01:05.849 --> 01:08.177
It's supposed to, like, bring in the New Year and everything...

01:08.555 --> 01:10.402
...so, we got some for you guys.

01:12.443 --> 01:12.921
No worries.

01:16.596 --> 01:17.403
You heard it from them,...

01:17.558 --> 01:19.395
...there are a lot of assumptions about homeless people:...

01:19.820 --> 01:22.285
...it must be drugs, it must be alcohol, it must be some crime.

01:23.243 --> 01:28.435
But a lot of it oftentimes is things outside their control that are happening...

01:28.535 --> 01:33.696
...and so I just think it's a valuable thing to do,...

01:33.783 --> 01:35.963
...just to sit down and learn someone's story.
