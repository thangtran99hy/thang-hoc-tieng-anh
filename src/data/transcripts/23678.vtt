It's been an incredible journey for Netflix over the last 15 years,...

00:06.457 --> 00:11.927
...and I thought it might be helpful if I went through some of the nuance of that...

00:12.067 --> 00:15.363
...for all of you in terms of building your companies.

00:16.160 --> 00:24.393
And back in 1995, '96, I got a big late fee at a local video store.

00:24.775 --> 00:28.821
And back in the day, you could really rack up a late fee.

00:29.103 --> 00:31.035
So, it was a 40-dollar late fee.

00:31.611 --> 00:36.738
And what I remember about it is I really didn't wanna tell my wife about it.

00:37.703 --> 00:40.157
And I sat there thinking,...

00:40.523 --> 00:44.444
..."Am I gonna compromise the integrity of my marriage over this late fee?"

00:44.843 --> 00:45.696
I was like, "Yeah!"

00:46.769 --> 00:50.474
I do not wanna talk about this late fee 'cause it was all my fault.
