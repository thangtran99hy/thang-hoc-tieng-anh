00:00.220 --> 00:05.131
And then with the advent of cloud computing and search, people realized,...

00:05.520 --> 00:09.469
..."Wow, machine intelligence, adaptive learning, big data."

00:09.868 --> 00:11.667
Here's a new set of techniques.

00:12.042 --> 00:18.453
And now we're able to throw enormous computational resources at it with cloud computing.

00:18.766 --> 00:20.764
And we're starting to make real progress.

00:21.094 --> 00:25.965
And so when you think of voice recognition in Siri or in Android,...

00:26.153 --> 00:28.577
...it's really getting impressively good.

00:28.967 --> 00:33.354
And it's doing this through these large-scale statistical techniques.
