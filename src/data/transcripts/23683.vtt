00:01.496 --> 00:04.675
More than 130 pyramids have been discovered in Egypt,...

00:04.903 --> 00:07.967
...but the Pyramids of Giza are the most famous of all,...

00:08.251 --> 00:10.306
...attracting millions of visitors each year.

00:11.677 --> 00:16.861
Located on the outskirts of Cairo, the archaeological site is called the Giza Necropolis.

00:17.663 --> 00:19.803
The complex is made up of three pyramids,...

00:19.969 --> 00:24.128
...and sitting to the east is the guardian of them all: the Sphinx.

00:25.531 --> 00:28.061
Lying in Pharaoh Khafre's necropolis,...

00:28.327 --> 00:31.349
...the Sphinx is carved from a single block of stone...

00:31.823 --> 00:34.597
...and depicts the pharaoh as a human-headed lion.

00:35.788 --> 00:38.389
The pyramids are over 4,000 years old.

00:38.688 --> 00:42.379
It's estimated between 20 to 30,000 workers were needed...

00:42.524 --> 00:46.457
...to polish and shift the massive limestone blocks into place.

00:46.860 --> 00:50.195
They not only house the remains of the deceased pharaohs,...

00:50.454 --> 00:54.727
...but were also used as storage for the items they would need in the afterlife.

00:55.473 --> 00:59.007
Due to the perfect geometry and sheer structural size,...

00:59.328 --> 01:02.976
...many have argued that the pyramids could not have been built by humans.

01:03.339 --> 01:08.095
Some have claimed, they were variously constructed by angels, the devil,...

01:08.282 --> 01:10.985
...or even visitors from another planet.
