You mean staring at each other's, looking into each other's eyes?

00:10.952 --> 00:12.347
Doesn't seem natural.

00:13.304 --> 00:14.742
Four minutes is a long time.

00:15.077 --> 00:16.079
No other instructions?

00:16.158 --> 00:17.812
No, I have to look in your eyes.

00:17.923 --> 00:18.581
Yeah, that's it?

00:18.816 --> 00:19.419
That's it.

00:19.691 --> 00:20.603
How did you feel?

00:21.285 --> 00:21.791
Weird.

00:23.195 --> 00:29.959
In 55 years of marriage, we've never really looked into each other's eyes like that.

00:30.260 --> 00:34.591
But I do look at your eyes sometimes 'cause I'm checking your blood sugar.

00:35.633 --> 00:37.050
You check on me all the time.

00:37.142 --> 00:37.541
Yeah.

00:39.604 --> 00:40.969
I wondered what you were thinking.

00:41.416 --> 00:47.018
How wonderful it was to just sit here and look at my wife for a change.

00:48.131 --> 00:54.851
Without discussing work, business and situations.

00:55.697 --> 01:02.461
When I look at you really closely, I realize how much I need you and what you mean to me.

01:02.588 --> 01:04.497
And because that's the truth.

01:04.863 --> 01:09.999
And I couldn't imagine being with anybody else.
