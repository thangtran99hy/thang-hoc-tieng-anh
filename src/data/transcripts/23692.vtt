00:00.787 --> 00:02.128
He's got supporters.

00:04.232 --> 00:08.477
Detroit, New York, Los Angeles.

00:08.576 --> 00:12.320
Inciting large-scale arrests and sympathy marches.

00:12.531 --> 00:15.176
I am very aware of that, Mr. Hoover.

00:15.615 --> 00:17.812
What I do know is, he's nonviolent.

00:18.187 --> 00:22.830
What I need to know right now, what's Martin Luther King about to do next?

00:23.358 --> 00:25.051
Mr. President, Dr. King is here.

00:25.858 --> 00:30.499
We will not tolerate agitators attempting to orchestrate a disturbance in this state!

00:30.855 --> 00:35.747
It is unacceptable that they use their power to keep us voiceless!

00:36.250 --> 00:39.272
Those that have gone before us say, "No more!"

00:40.201 --> 00:41.276
We must march!

00:41.612 --> 00:42.614
We must stand up!

00:42.893 --> 00:45.347
We must make a massive demonstration!

00:45.555 --> 00:51.764
My eyes have seen the glory, glory, glory, hallelujah!

00:51.987 --> 00:54.952
What happens when a man stands up and says, "Enough is enough?"
