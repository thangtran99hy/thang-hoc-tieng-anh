Every single minute, eight people are forced to flee their homes to escape war.

00:06.503 --> 00:08.797
It's a reality that's unimaginable to many.

00:09.010 --> 00:13.230
But now there's an app designed to inform people about these hardships.

00:13.649 --> 00:16.251
It's called, "My Life as a Refugee."

00:16.943 --> 00:19.867
It's an app that sheds light on different social challenges...

00:19.924 --> 00:21.286
...people face around the globe.

00:21.941 --> 00:27.339
And so users can choose one of these characters to try and experience their reality.

00:28.116 --> 00:31.327
It poses questions like whether or not one should leave their home...

00:31.627 --> 00:35.481
...or stay despite the dangers which sometimes turn deadly.
