The new MacBook is the result of a collective obsession...

00:08.897 --> 00:14.733
...to simplify its essential components to create the most efficient design possible.

00:17.173 --> 00:22.175
It's a product that couldn't exist without invention across many disciplines.

00:29.163 --> 00:33.436
A Retina display delivers the very best viewing experience.

00:34.979 --> 00:40.811
To engineer the thinnest Retina screen for Mac, we've refined every component...

00:41.320 --> 00:43.818
...from the glass down to the pixels.

00:46.825 --> 00:52.378
The result of all of this is a product that's only 13.1 millimeters thick...

00:52.752 --> 00:54.823
...and weighs just two pounds.

00:58.891 --> 01:04.474
To create a new MacBook, we were uncompromising in its design and engineering.

01:05.657 --> 01:11.811
We set a new standard for portability while enhancing its fundamental components...

01:12.883 --> 01:17.690
...to deliver what we believe is the best MacBook yet.
