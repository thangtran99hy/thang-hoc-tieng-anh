It's one of the most visited places on earth,...

00:04.652 --> 00:06.313
...but hidden from the eyes of tourists,...

00:06.401 --> 00:09.941
...these people wait in line behind the Vatican's Bernini Columns.

00:10.253 --> 00:11.056
They're homeless.

00:11.303 --> 00:16.260
They're hoping to take a shower and get a haircut in the newly opened shower stalls.

00:17.099 --> 00:18.153
This really helps us out a lot.

00:18.318 --> 00:21.415
It's great for people like us who don't have a house or any belongings.

00:21.583 --> 00:23.491
It's a very difficult situation to be in.

00:23.690 --> 00:27.521

00:32.707 --> 00:34.166

00:34.233 --> 00:37.723
They've taught me to never make a distinction between those who have money and those who don't.

00:38.131 --> 00:42.069
They've shown me to look at people with integrity because everyone deserves to be listened to.

00:42.493 --> 00:44.979
He's been a hairdresser for the last 40 years.

00:45.079 --> 00:46.577
It's what he does for a living.

00:46.817 --> 00:50.806
But coming to Rome to help the homeless isn't about money or profit.

00:51.211 --> 00:55.485
Helping the needy, he says, is something that money just can't buy.
