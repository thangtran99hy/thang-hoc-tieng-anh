Plato once said, "Seek truth while you are young,..."

00:04.553 --> 00:07.121
"...for if you do not, it will later escape your grasp."

00:07.590 --> 00:11.636
Recently, a conference in Rome studied the broader implications of Plato's quote.

00:12.169 --> 00:14.623
The conference was called "Philosophy as Paideia,"...

00:14.975 --> 00:17.836
...a reference to the well-rounded education of ancient times.

00:18.104 --> 00:19.818
Participants discussed how to think...

00:20.007 --> 00:22.915
...but also how to teach the discipline in a more practical way.

00:23.665 --> 00:28.361
For example, for a doctor, philosophy is useful for reflecting on what makes someone human...

00:28.435 --> 00:29.865
...or what suffering means.

00:30.138 --> 00:32.159
Philosophy can even help an engineer.

00:32.497 --> 00:37.112
An engineer can use a different mindset to think about a technique or what it means.

00:37.560 --> 00:41.663
The professors believe that philosophy helps develop self-esteem and personality.

00:41.916 --> 00:44.255
They say it is crucial for a young person's formation.

00:44.373 --> 00:47.709
We see that there is a very present demand for philosophy,...

00:47.815 --> 00:49.985
...which is basically a desire to know.

00:50.241 --> 00:52.655
And you don't expect it but people need this.

00:53.135 --> 00:56.766
The Pontifical University of the Holy Cross organized the conference.

00:56.854 --> 01:01.042
It drew an international group of businesspeople, teachers and philosophers.
