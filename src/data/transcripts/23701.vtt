Hi Anne, thank you very much.

00:01.435 --> 00:03.199
Well, you know, it's actually been lighter than usual.

00:03.436 --> 00:06.578
People really took notice of the morning to stay away from Doyle Drive.

00:06.625 --> 00:08.736
We're going to show you some live look here in that area.

00:08.739 --> 00:10.623
Here's a live look at the Golden Gate Bridge...

00:10.627 --> 00:12.681
...where you can see traffic isn't doing too badly.

00:12.911 --> 00:15.517
We did see some slight delays in the right hand side there...

00:15.575 --> 00:18.773
...just as you approach the toll plaza but that's actually eased up quite a bit...

00:18.799 --> 00:20.508
...so again, it has been very light.

00:20.677 --> 00:23.149
Elsewhere, some of our alternates though have been quite busy.

00:23.262 --> 00:25.429
We were seeing delays across the Bay Bridge.

00:25.664 --> 00:27.401
At one point, they did turn the metering lights on...

00:27.472 --> 00:29.614
...so it has been busier than usual for the Bay Bridge.

00:29.656 --> 00:33.504
In fact, you can see the upper deck of the Bay Bridge crawling along into San Francisco,...

00:33.579 --> 00:35.777
...not too bad though out of San Francisco into Oakland.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.672
ï»¿Things have been lighter than usual.

00:37.710 --> 00:39.534
They do have traffic control on scene.

00:39.748 --> 00:42.422
Again, we have seen some slight delays in the turn lanes.

00:42.485 --> 00:44.586
Now, the turn lanes are available for commuters.

00:44.788 --> 00:48.623
Typically, they're only available for buses as you travel through there on to California and Geary...

00:48.670 --> 00:50.394
...but again, we are seeing some busy conditions...

00:50.463 --> 00:52.075
...on that southbound side of Park Presidio.

00:52.185 --> 00:55.072
So hopefully, things will wrap up by 5 AM as scheduled.
