Good morning, Sam, I'm on the road here,...

00:02.945 --> 00:05.980
...I-95 in New York and yes, already very crowded.

00:06.049 --> 00:09.671
I'm doing what tens of millions of people are going to be doing today,...

00:10.071 --> 00:14.136
...behind the wheel and sitting right here, seeing a whole lot of that.

00:14.406 --> 00:15.472
A lot of brake lights.

00:17.134 --> 00:21.590
This morning, the infamous Thanksgiving travel rush could come to an abrupt halt...

00:21.685 --> 00:23.109
...in one of the nation's hubs.

00:23.513 --> 00:26.881
That thick fog in Chicago that's creating zero visibility...

00:27.156 --> 00:29.441
...could cause chaos for the rest of the country.

00:29.739 --> 00:31.105
Now take a look at this.

00:31.367 --> 00:34.453
A 30-mile backup on a Massachusetts Turnpike last night,...

00:34.693 --> 00:38.599
...spreads snarls on all major highways in the eastern part of the state.

00:39.380 --> 00:42.575
The top 5 cities bracing for the worst traffic today:...

00:42.942 --> 00:47.190
...New York, Washington DC, Chicago, San Francisco...

00:47.401 --> 00:50.150
...and the most tangled roads, in Los Angeles,...

00:50.427 --> 00:55.387
...with holiday road trips there predicted to take 33% longer than usual.
