00:00.572 --> 00:03.765
This is the face at the center of a frantic search...

00:03.837 --> 00:05.551
...ten-month-old Lisa Irwin.

00:05.889 --> 00:09.535
She's got blue eyes, blonde hair, and just two bottom teeth.

00:09.987 --> 00:14.431
She was last seen wearing purple shorts and a purple shirt with kittens on it.

00:14.996 --> 00:18.755
Her mother Debbie told police she put Lisa down to sleep in her crib...

00:19.055 --> 00:20.834
...at around 10:30 Monday night.

00:21.015 --> 00:23.717
When her husband Jeremy came home at 4:00 AM...

00:23.796 --> 00:26.027
...after working an overnight job as an electrician,...

00:26.361 --> 00:28.701
...he found the baby missing and called police.

00:29.010 --> 00:32.339
We've got a five and a half window during which this child could have been taken.

00:32.415 --> 00:33.490
That's a pretty big window.

00:33.683 --> 00:34.669
That's right, yeah.

00:34.863 --> 00:36.944
From an investigative standpoint, that's a big challenge.

00:37.062 --> 00:37.525
It is.

00:37.701 --> 00:39.847
The police immediately issued an Amber Alert...

00:39.933 --> 00:42.316
...and launched a massive search with the FBI,...

00:42.392 --> 00:46.950
...the ATF, the Marshals Service, Mounted Patrols and K-9 units.

00:47.352 --> 00:50.625
The vast majority of child abductions in America are carried out...

00:50.883 --> 00:52.581
...by people who know the child.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.605
Lisa Irwin's parents who have two older children,...

00:55.679 --> 00:59.495
...each from previous marriages are not being called suspects right now...

00:59.580 --> 01:01.857
...but they are being questioned intensively.

01:02.221 --> 01:04.504
And police say they are cooperating.
