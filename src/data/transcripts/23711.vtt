ï»¿Add traffic lights to the long and growing list of electronic devices...

00:03.847 --> 00:05.329
...that have now been hacked.

00:05.779 --> 00:08.776
A security expert in New York says that he was able to take control...

00:08.855 --> 00:13.125
...of Manhattan's traffic light system and cause a traffic jam at will.

00:13.768 --> 00:15.500
And that he was inspired from movies...

00:15.623 --> 00:20.513
...because a cyber-terrorist in Die Hard, Die Hard 4: Live Free or Die,...

00:21.191 --> 00:23.694
...took control remotely of the traffic system.

00:24.038 --> 00:27.287
And so he started looking around to see if he could do it and he did.

00:28.034 --> 00:30.093
He could also take control of the same system,...

00:30.213 --> 00:34.665
...which is used in 40 different US cities and nine different countries.

00:35.077 --> 00:39.029
The same system is used in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York,...

00:39.354 --> 00:43.229
...Washington, D.C. and other cities around the world.

00:43.891 --> 00:45.795
And what makes it even more bizarre...

00:46.149 --> 00:51.910
...is he said he was able to do it from a drone that he flew over the systems.
