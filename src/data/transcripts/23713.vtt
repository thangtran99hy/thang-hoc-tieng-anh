I'm Bianca Currington.

00:01.429 --> 00:05.617
I am in America on an exchange program with Virgin America.

00:06.180 --> 00:09.603
Virgin Blue, Virgin America have swapped crew for one year,...

00:10.345 --> 00:14.634
...to experience each other's culture and differences in work.

00:16.869 --> 00:17.584
I'm Sarah.

00:17.654 --> 00:18.733
I'm 26 years old.

00:18.888 --> 00:21.303
I am from Western Australia, a place called Perth.

00:21.777 --> 00:23.959
Virgin America is such a great company to work for.

00:24.072 --> 00:27.698
They are so young, they're so fresh, they're so vibrant,...

00:28.074 --> 00:31.345
...and they make you want to support them in every single way,...

00:31.425 --> 00:33.250
...because you work in such a vibrant atmosphere,...

00:33.338 --> 00:35.218
...you can't help be that person as well.

00:35.439 --> 00:38.511
It's a fantastic opportunity to be able to live somewhere else for a year,...

00:38.881 --> 00:42.684
...and enjoy that time and see how the other Virgin brands work.
