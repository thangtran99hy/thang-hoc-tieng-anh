ï»¿I'm Tony Lepore.

00:06.948 --> 00:08.223
They call me the Dancing Cop.

00:08.295 --> 00:09.783
I'm from Providence, Rhode Island.

00:10.596 --> 00:14.594
I've been directing traffic my way for 27 years.

00:18.933 --> 00:24.743
I was kind of bored one day and plus I can dance and sing...

00:24.838 --> 00:27.605
...and I always wanted to be an entertainer when I was younger.

00:28.259 --> 00:33.825
And I just did a couple of spins and some hand movements and the people loved it.

00:35.508 --> 00:38.897
I think it would be more of a distraction if I was in a different town...

00:39.449 --> 00:40.783
...and they didn't know I was out there.

00:40.861 --> 00:44.684
But most in Providence, they even know me by the sound of my whistle.

00:44.805 --> 00:46.312
My joints take a beating, you're right.

00:47.234 --> 00:50.582
But like only my chiropractor knows.

00:52.999 --> 00:57.309
It's all rhythm or I'll go and interrupt it with one of these.

01:00.149 --> 01:05.266
Or like I told you before, my hands are tied up and I can't, I'll give them one of these.
