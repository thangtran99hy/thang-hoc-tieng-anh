00:00.193 --> 00:04.154
Good afternoon, this is your captain speaking with just a little flight information.

00:04.255 --> 00:07.573
Coming up on the left, we're going to be catching a glimpse of the Grand Canyon,...

00:07.653 --> 00:10.779
...on the right you can be able to see the Hoover Dam in just a few minutes.

00:11.125 --> 00:16.217
We're flying at an altitude of 37,000 feet and our airspeed is 400 miles an hour.

00:17.182 --> 00:18.128
Couple little facts here,...

00:18.187 --> 00:23.115
...I'm packing a Colt King Cobra, that's a .357 caliber firearm,...

00:23.465 --> 00:25.882
..with a black rubber grip and a six inch barrel.

00:26.218 --> 00:29.495
Also, the copilot is carrying a Kimber Custom Defense pistol...

00:29.573 --> 00:32.294
..with all the bells and whistles you'd expect from a custom gun of that kind,...

00:32.385 --> 00:34.878
...with an alloy frame and bevel treatment on the entire gun.

00:35.039 --> 00:38.107
And our chief flight attendant, Roger, has a Ruger Bearcat,...

00:38.191 --> 00:40.830
...a .22 with a hand-fluted cylinder.

00:40.962 --> 00:45.150
All three are capable of piercing body armor at a distance of up to 27 feet...

00:45.349 --> 00:48.465
...and can put a hole in human bone and flesh the size of the Grand Canyon,...

00:48.543 --> 00:51.141
...which, by the way, is coming up on the left hand side of the plane,...

00:51.217 --> 00:53.897
...so just sit back and relax and enjoy the rest of the flight.
