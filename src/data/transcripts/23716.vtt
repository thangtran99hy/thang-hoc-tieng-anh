00:00.102 --> 00:02.208
Welcome aboard Outdated Airlines everyone.

00:02.268 --> 00:04.637
My name is Brent and this is my colleague, Jim.

00:04.887 --> 00:09.447
We here at Outdated Air pride ourselves on maintaining the status quo of air travel.

00:09.575 --> 00:12.503
That means no Wi-Fi, no food and no legroom.

00:12.805 --> 00:16.226
Tie your seatbelts, sit forward and let's all get uncomfortable.

00:16.555 --> 00:19.577
Today's in-flight entertainment is "Captain Phillips."

00:19.774 --> 00:21.033
Captain!

00:26.448 --> 00:29.470
Does loyalty have you stuck in 1986?

00:29.972 --> 00:31.970
Break free with Virgin America.
