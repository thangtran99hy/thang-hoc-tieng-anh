There's nothing more horrifying than a plane plummeting from the sky.

00:04.153 --> 00:09.109
But for members of an exclusive club of 14 sole survivors of plane crashes,...

00:09.255 --> 00:12.277
...the experience is a lifelong badge of terror.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.271
At least one confirmed survivor.

00:14.350 --> 00:15.650
Yeah, one known survivor.

00:15.750 --> 00:20.224
This is Cecelia Cichan who in 1987 at just four years old,...

00:20.331 --> 00:23.187
...became the little girl known as America's orphan.

00:23.337 --> 00:25.470
The whole world is rooting for Cecelia.

00:25.613 --> 00:30.192
Flight 255 had just taken off from Detroit Metro Airport when it crashed,...

00:30.489 --> 00:33.853
...killing 154 on board, two on the ground.

00:34.087 --> 00:36.115
But out of tragedy, one miracle.

00:36.245 --> 00:39.804
Four-year-old Cecelia Cichan has now been told by relatives...

00:39.891 --> 00:43.424
...that her mother, father and six-year-old brother died in that crash.
