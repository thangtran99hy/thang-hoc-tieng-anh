00:00.715 --> 00:03.769
The ten-hour surgery was risky and delicate.

00:04.055 --> 00:06.783
Just separating the girls took more than two hours,...

00:07.037 --> 00:11.451
...nearly half of the operation was spent reconstructing their tiny bodies.

00:11.795 --> 00:15.457
But when it was finally over, these conjoined twins from the Philippines...

00:15.576 --> 00:20.813
...emerged in a California hospital as unique individuals for the very first time.

00:20.949 --> 00:21.910
We're very pleased.

00:22.086 --> 00:24.187
Things basically could not have gone better.

00:24.719 --> 00:29.799
Angelina and Angelica Sabuco have never spent a night without the other by her side.

00:30.167 --> 00:32.302
They have never taken a step alone.

00:32.525 --> 00:36.389
Their mother hopes today is the start of a healthy, ordinary life.

00:37.006 --> 00:39.887
The girls were born attached at the chest and abdomen,...

00:40.135 --> 00:42.877
...joined from the middle of the breastbone down to the navel.

00:43.208 --> 00:45.430
They had two hearts but shared a liver.

00:45.799 --> 00:49.655
Separating that organ was the most challenging part of the operation.

00:49.773 --> 00:54.173
It took 20 doctors and nurses from Stanford University's Children's Hospital...

00:54.255 --> 00:56.859
...to help conceive this double dose miracle.

00:57.243 --> 01:02.252
Doctor Gary Hartman who led the team is no stranger to this complicated operation.

01:02.633 --> 01:05.855
This was his sixth separation of conjoined twins.

01:06.019 --> 01:09.328
The girls will spend at least the next week in intensive care...

01:09.636 --> 01:12.250
...and the next few months, rehabilitating their strength.

01:12.563 --> 01:14.905
Their future remains bright.
