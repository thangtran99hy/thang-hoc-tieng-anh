ï»¿Hey Alex, how are you?

00:11.867 --> 00:12.445
Pleasure to meet you.

00:12.897 --> 00:15.760
I have another bionics expert on hand so I thought I'd drop by.

00:16.161 --> 00:16.605
Thank you.

00:16.803 --> 00:17.403
Yes, a pleasure.

00:17.579 --> 00:18.587
Nice bow tie, by the way.

00:18.913 --> 00:19.259
Thanks.

00:19.629 --> 00:20.398
How were your travels?

00:20.531 --> 00:21.216
It's very good.

00:21.589 --> 00:26.015
Well, I thought I'd bring one of my gauntlets and match it up with yours...

00:26.159 --> 00:28.069
...and see if everything is copacetic.

00:28.145 --> 00:28.745
Do you wanna have a look?

00:29.143 --> 00:29.382
Sure.

00:32.318 --> 00:32.633
Ready?

00:32.919 --> 00:33.118
Yup.

00:33.546 --> 00:33.704
Great.

00:37.039 --> 00:38.496
Each one looks the same.

00:39.284 --> 00:40.992
Actually, I think yours might be better than mine.

00:41.871 --> 00:45.461
What do you say we both try 'em on.

00:45.831 --> 00:46.685
Do a progress report.

00:47.375 --> 00:47.707
Okay.

00:48.450 --> 00:49.319
Do you know who that is?

00:49.687 --> 00:50.444
Iron Man.

00:52.994 --> 00:53.606
What's his name?

00:54.993 --> 00:55.605
Robert.

00:56.388 --> 00:57.053
Great!

01:00.677 --> 01:02.123
I'm having a technical glitch.

01:03.792 --> 01:05.625
As you can see, my light isn't working.

01:05.735 --> 01:09.896
Half the time, I design one of these, it winds up breaking on me.

01:10.183 --> 01:11.588
But what I do is I keep working on it.

01:11.731 --> 01:13.168
Kinda like you're working on it with Albert.

01:13.544 --> 01:15.867
He keeps working and working until he gets it right.

01:16.396 --> 01:16.607
Yeah.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.893
I think yours is still a little bit more right than mine because at least, you know.

01:20.694 --> 01:21.554
The lights work.

01:21.653 --> 01:22.664
Your light works, yeah.

01:24.010 --> 01:25.447
Ah, look at that then.

01:25.999 --> 01:29.240
It's a marriage of robotic technologies.

01:30.547 --> 01:31.335
Bang, nailed it!

01:32.059 --> 01:32.427
Love it.
