Mountain biking is an amazing sport.

00:05.375 --> 00:06.766
It gets people to the outdoors.

00:09.508 --> 00:10.741
It brings people together.

00:13.312 --> 00:14.765
It's healthy lifestyle living.

00:19.075 --> 00:21.157
Everybody asks us why our bikes are so special.

00:23.639 --> 00:26.181
There is no one thing you can do with a mountain bike that make it great.

00:26.279 --> 00:27.540
It's a piece of all of it:...

00:28.185 --> 00:29.424
...the geometry of the bike,...

00:29.678 --> 00:30.963
...the way the standover is set,...

00:31.044 --> 00:32.038
...the bottom bracket height,...

00:32.373 --> 00:37.025
...all those things make the bike special and it's changing those little formulas around...

00:37.285 --> 00:40.714
...and getting it just right that actually makes for an awesome riding experience.

00:42.079 --> 00:45.073
We pride ourselves on how well-made our bikes are...

00:45.127 --> 00:47.347
...and how much time we spend designing them.
