00:11.929 --> 00:12.960
ï»¿Why are we doing this?

00:13.523 --> 00:14.885
We've got some work to do.

00:24.445 --> 00:25.676
We shouldn't be up here, Drac.

00:26.377 --> 00:27.790
Who's ready to fly?

00:28.181 --> 00:30.411
Me, me like a superhero!

00:30.639 --> 00:31.285
Better!

00:31.496 --> 00:32.875
Like a vampire!

00:33.271 --> 00:34.125
I don't know about this.

00:34.398 --> 00:35.274
He's half human.

00:35.606 --> 00:37.155
Maybe the kid isn't supposed to fly.

00:37.293 --> 00:37.708
Quiet!

00:38.045 --> 00:39.072
This is how they learn.

00:39.429 --> 00:41.088
You throw them and they figure it out.

00:42.053 --> 00:43.112
It's how I was taught.

00:43.659 --> 00:46.897
Here we go!

00:52.679 --> 00:53.572
He's still not flying.

00:53.904 --> 00:54.384
He will.

00:56.393 --> 00:56.956
Still not.

00:57.352 --> 00:58.228
It will happen.

01:00.093 --> 01:01.030
This is a tall tower.

01:01.141 --> 01:02.121
That's why it's good.

01:03.277 --> 01:03.823
You should get him.

01:04.787 --> 01:05.391
Drac!

01:05.595 --> 01:07.212
I did that to my first time.

01:08.185 --> 01:09.807
He's getting too close to the ground!

01:11.157 --> 01:12.603
You know what, he's not gonna fly.

01:18.216 --> 01:19.144
Again, again!
