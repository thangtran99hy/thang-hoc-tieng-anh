Have you talked to Mary lately?

00:09.021 --> 00:10.711
Hey man, sorry to bring it up.

00:10.986 --> 00:12.439
We're just worried about you.

00:15.727 --> 00:17.202
I'll be honest with you, Tom.

00:17.467 --> 00:18.351
I'm angry.

00:19.223 --> 00:21.175
I feel foolish for having trusted her.

00:22.545 --> 00:24.245
I'm sure you've contemplated leaving...

00:24.348 --> 00:26.602
...but I realized, it can be hard when you're in the thick of it.

00:26.931 --> 00:29.680
Me, I didn't find out until after I left...

00:29.787 --> 00:31.501
...that she didn't think it was working either.
