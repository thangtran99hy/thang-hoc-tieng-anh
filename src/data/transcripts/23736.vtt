00:00.483 --> 00:01.895
The world goes green.

00:04.568 --> 00:08.654
But here in Ireland, every day is bathed in green.

00:10.123 --> 00:13.984
After all, this emerald isle is like nowhere else on Earth.

00:15.446 --> 00:17.845
A rugged coast and grassy hills collide.

00:19.359 --> 00:23.390
And time can stand still or fly by.

00:24.938 --> 00:28.256
It is a place where music flows as easily as conversations...

00:29.184 --> 00:32.684
...and welcomes are warm and delivered with a smile.
