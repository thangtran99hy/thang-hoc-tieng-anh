Hello, children.

00:06.332 --> 00:10.777
Five little monkeys jumping on the bed, one fell off and bumped his head.

00:11.786 --> 00:13.955
Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,...

00:14.527 --> 00:16.587
..."No more monkeys jumping on the bed."

00:21.243 --> 00:25.372
Four little monkeys jumping on the bed, one fell off and bumped his head.

00:26.221 --> 00:28.487
Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,...

00:31.838 --> 00:34.007
..."No more monkeys jumping on the bed."

00:42.863 --> 00:48.672
Three little monkeys jumping on the bed, one fell off and bumped his head.

00:50.628 --> 00:51.621
This is taking too long.

00:53.155 --> 00:55.243
So I will summarize, listen very carefully.

00:55.643 --> 00:57.218
All of the monkeys fall off the bed.

00:57.290 --> 00:58.957
The doctor is slightly frustrated,...

00:59.167 --> 01:03.385
...having repeatedly instructed their mother not to allow them to jump on the bed.

01:04.441 --> 01:07.283
Besides, why is she calling a doctor and not a vet?

01:08.605 --> 01:11.797
This woman is sick and should be committed to a mental institution.

01:12.602 --> 01:13.405
The end.

01:15.713 --> 01:16.972
Sweet dreams, kids.
