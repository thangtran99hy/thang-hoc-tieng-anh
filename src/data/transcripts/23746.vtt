Rise and shine.

00:07.967 --> 00:10.845
This is your train captain at the front of this train, speaking.

00:11.938 --> 00:15.493
We will soon be making a brief stop at Ang Mo Kio.

00:16.351 --> 00:18.901
The doors on the right side will open.

00:20.058 --> 00:23.563
As a gentle reminder, if you're planning to leave anything behind,...

00:24.029 --> 00:27.309
...please make sure that it's something I can either use or sell.

00:28.189 --> 00:32.299
If otherwise, please remember to take all your belongings with you,...

00:32.886 --> 00:35.138
...and watch your step when you leave the train.
