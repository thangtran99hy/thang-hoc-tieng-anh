ï»¿Music is the heart between the mind and the hands.

00:05.451 --> 00:08.220
It has no religion, no sexual orientation.

00:08.487 --> 00:09.595
It brings people together.

00:09.855 --> 00:14.067
In the music industry, I have definitely had to knock through some doors.

00:16.599 --> 00:20.896
When I first started out, I was told to dress a certain way,...

00:21.384 --> 00:22.585
...to wear my hair a certain way.

00:22.826 --> 00:24.691
"Girls can't dance like that."

00:24.867 --> 00:26.616
"That's not what sexy is."

00:26.997 --> 00:30.343
When people say we can't do something, I love proving people wrong.

00:32.253 --> 00:37.016
I just hope that some young girl sees this and they wanna take ownership of their powers,...

00:37.097 --> 00:40.242
...and use their superpowers to help change the world around them.

00:40.412 --> 00:42.538
Yes, I can be a woman of color.

00:42.803 --> 00:44.854
Now, I can own my own recording label,...

00:45.101 --> 00:46.736
...sell my music independently.

00:47.371 --> 00:48.872
I can be Janelle Monae...

00:49.675 --> 00:51.241
...and I didn't have to change who I was.
