00:03.897 --> 00:07.033
I was dating a Sicilian girl from Flushing, Queens.

00:07.487 --> 00:10.935
And the first time I went to her mom's house for dinner,...

00:11.292 --> 00:13.813
...she was over there at the chopping block, cutting onions.

00:13.937 --> 00:16.163
And she says, "You! Come here!"

00:16.270 --> 00:17.653
Real thick New York accent.

00:18.251 --> 00:21.728
She slaps me a couple times on the cheek, tells me to sit down...

00:21.825 --> 00:25.160
...and proceeds to feed me one of the best Italian meals I've ever had.

00:28.681 --> 00:34.405
I bought a ticket to Italy and I won an apprenticeship at La Vecchia Scuola Bolognese.

00:37.086 --> 00:40.455
Six days a week, 12 hours a day, nothing but handmade pasta.

00:40.647 --> 00:41.697
Pasta fatta a mano.

00:41.967 --> 00:43.717
We ate it for lunch, we ate it for dinner,...

00:43.803 --> 00:45.632
...we made it all day long.

00:46.809 --> 00:49.603
The perfect sheet of pasta is fleeting.

00:51.124 --> 00:54.380
It's an animal: it lives, it breathes, it sweats.

00:55.325 --> 00:57.065
Every day the pasta is different.

00:58.002 --> 01:01.593
And every single one is its own fingerprint.
