00:04.227 --> 00:05.156
Greatness.

00:06.472 --> 00:08.243
It's just something we made up.

00:11.317 --> 00:16.587
Somehow we've come to believe greatness is a gift reserved for a chosen few.

00:18.349 --> 00:19.581
For prodigies.

00:20.927 --> 00:22.242
For superstars.

00:23.567 --> 00:26.191
And the rest of us can only stand by watching.

00:28.263 --> 00:29.693
You can forget that.

00:31.891 --> 00:34.857
Greatness is not some rare DNA strand.

00:36.003 --> 00:38.001
It's not some precious thing.

00:39.763 --> 00:42.558
Greatness is no more unique to us than breathing.

00:44.609 --> 00:46.493
We're all capable of it.

00:49.147 --> 00:50.235
All of us.
