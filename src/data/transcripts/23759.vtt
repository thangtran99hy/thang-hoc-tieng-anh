When I smell roses, I think of my mother.

00:03.521 --> 00:05.524
When I was a little boy, we had a rose bush in the backyard.

00:05.727 --> 00:08.355
And I remember it was yellow with red tips.

00:08.770 --> 00:12.234
And I still see it today and I think, "Oh, it's so beautiful."

00:12.315 --> 00:16.925
But I think, "Wow, what wasn't I seeing in that rose?"

00:20.395 --> 00:25.479
If I were to see that rose and suddenly these other colors were there,...

00:25.566 --> 00:27.991
...I would think it would be kind of like poetic.

00:33.484 --> 00:36.423
First day of school, she would take me to the backyard,...

00:36.841 --> 00:40.944
...and she would cut a rose and give it to me to give to my teacher.

00:41.756 --> 00:46.250
I thought, "What if I suddenly saw all these colors that I never saw before?"

00:46.319 --> 00:51.247
It would be like in a way my mother was speaking again to me.
