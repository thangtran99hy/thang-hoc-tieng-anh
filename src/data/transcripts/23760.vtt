The lesson I've learned from working with stylists is...

00:09.561 --> 00:12.811
...there's only a little part of it that has actually to do with the clothes.

00:13.079 --> 00:15.395
It's about how you feel in the clothes.

00:17.076 --> 00:21.950
I've had people put me in things too tight or too big or just don't look good.

00:22.028 --> 00:23.873
They may look good but I don't feel good.

00:23.961 --> 00:26.659
I think the thing in my wardrobe which I always go to,...

00:26.755 --> 00:30.415
...that which I know is gonna look good is this designer coat that I have.

00:30.584 --> 00:33.947
It's black and it feels amazing.

00:34.154 --> 00:37.945
And even if I'm wearing tracksuit bottoms or trainers or anything,...

00:38.023 --> 00:40.275
...you just put that on the top and it looks great.
