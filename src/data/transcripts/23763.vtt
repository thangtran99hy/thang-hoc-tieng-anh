When I was 17, I got pregnant.

00:04.043 --> 00:10.827
And the light of my life is my father but he gave me 24 hours to leave town.

00:11.531 --> 00:20.641
And I gave this baby up for adoption and said at that time that I will adopt a child...

00:20.875 --> 00:23.360
...when I'm able to take care of a child.

00:25.408 --> 00:25.801
Wow.

00:26.901 --> 00:28.995
I just wasn't ready for that.

00:29.073 --> 00:29.828
I'm sure.

00:30.591 --> 00:34.817
So many times I would think, "Gosh, is this the time to tell him?"

00:35.404 --> 00:41.697
But I'm 73 now and it just seems like such a big secret.

00:43.165 --> 00:46.896
It's kind of funny, I think where you're concerned, I try not to be very emotional...

00:47.651 --> 00:51.321
...and I worry that you'll never know just how deeply I love you...

00:51.995 --> 00:58.113
...and how scary it is for me sometimes to imagine life without you.

00:59.152 --> 01:01.943
That's something I can't make better for you.

01:02.444 --> 01:06.210
And I don't doubt it'll be tough but you'll be okay.
