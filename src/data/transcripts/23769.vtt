Miss Nagasaki.

00:05.713 --> 00:08.195
Ariana Miyamoto's beauty wowed the judges.

00:08.543 --> 00:10.519
But her appearance has caused controversy...

00:10.627 --> 00:13.088
...after she won Japan's Miss Universe contest.

00:13.619 --> 00:15.777
And some feels she's not Japanese enough.

00:16.397 --> 00:18.737
The 20-year-old model is a Japanese citizen...

00:19.039 --> 00:22.070
...and a daughter of a Japanese woman and an African-American man,...

00:22.453 --> 00:24.188
...which the Japanese describe as "hafu",...

00:24.453 --> 00:28.791
...a word refers to a multiracial or multiethnic half Japanese person.

00:29.273 --> 00:33.182
A film called Hafu looked at the lives of multiracial Japanese citizens,...

00:33.747 --> 00:36.856
...pointing out that about 20,000 half Japanese people...

00:37.369 --> 00:41.599
...including multiethnic and multiracial people are born in Japan each year.

00:42.197 --> 00:45.491
As Japan is considered one of the most homogenous places on Earth,...

00:45.910 --> 00:50.875
...it seems Miyamoto's win may prompt many to question what it really means to be Japanese.
