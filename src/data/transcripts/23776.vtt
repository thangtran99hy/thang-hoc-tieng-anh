00:00.340 --> 00:03.175
Love arrives exactly when love is supposed to,...

00:03.807 --> 00:06.065
...and love leaves exactly when love must.

00:06.357 --> 00:08.763
When love arrives, say, "Welcome."

00:09.204 --> 00:10.587
"Make yourself comfortable."

00:11.210 --> 00:14.532
If love leaves, ask her to leave the door open behind her.

00:15.100 --> 00:21.493
Turn off the music, listen to the quiet, whisper, "Thank you for stopping by."
