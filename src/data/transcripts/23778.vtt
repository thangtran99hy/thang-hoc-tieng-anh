00:02.782 --> 00:05.355
The dos and don'ts of savvy airfare shoppers.

00:05.841 --> 00:08.559
Do start shopping about four months before departure.

00:08.884 --> 00:11.339
That's when the airlines start releasing the cheapest seats.

00:11.724 --> 00:14.839
But don't buy all your family's tickets in a single transaction.

00:15.614 --> 00:16.823
Airline reservation systems...

00:16.919 --> 00:20.225
...require everyone on the same booking to fly at the same price.

00:21.005 --> 00:24.375
So split your booking and you may find cheaper individual fares.

00:25.089 --> 00:26.745
Do check on connecting flights.

00:27.380 --> 00:30.647
They're starting to get a lot cheaper than those pricey nonstops.

00:31.213 --> 00:33.578
Don't take flights with connections that are too tight.

00:34.228 --> 00:36.146
Have at least one hour between flights...

00:36.715 --> 00:38.570
...and make that two hours in the winter time.

00:39.319 --> 00:42.250
Do set up flight status alerts for your cellphone...

00:42.479 --> 00:43.749
...and those that are picking you up.

00:44.164 --> 00:45.475
It'll save you a big hassle.
