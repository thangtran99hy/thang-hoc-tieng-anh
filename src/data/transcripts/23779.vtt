Earthquake proof, they claim, this is now the world's longest bridge to cross water.

00:08.621 --> 00:11.920
Up to 30,000 cars a day can now use its six lanes...

00:12.003 --> 00:15.687
...to travel between the port of Qingdao and its industrial suburbs.

00:16.527 --> 00:18.729
Chinese media reports were quick to highlight...

00:18.826 --> 00:21.303
...the sheer scale of their engineers' achievements.

00:22.147 --> 00:25.762
At 26 and a half miles long, the bridge is longer than the English Channel.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.980
It did take 17 years to plan...

00:29.417 --> 00:34.967
...but building only began in 2007 by 10,000 construction staff...

00:35.353 --> 00:36.564
...who worked around the clock.
