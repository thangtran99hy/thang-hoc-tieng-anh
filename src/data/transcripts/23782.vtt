Hello, I am a highly sophisticated robot and I write letters for Bond.

00:11.864 --> 00:13.165
This robot's a little different.

00:13.427 --> 00:16.366
This robot holds a pen and it writes like you do.

00:16.881 --> 00:19.588
Bond lets you send handwritten notes from your phone or your computer.

00:19.957 --> 00:23.341
Just type in your note and enter the address and we'll take care of the rest.

00:24.115 --> 00:30.173
We've built a robot that can do anything a human can do with a pen and output it exactly.

00:31.569 --> 00:33.397
Bond is something that everybody can use.

00:33.503 --> 00:36.269
Brides and grooms can personalize their own stationery...

00:36.376 --> 00:39.398
...and send out thank you notes in a matter of minutes instead of days.

00:39.741 --> 00:43.900
An organization can add a personal touch in a way that they've never been able to do before.

00:44.051 --> 00:45.593
If you want to use your own handwriting,...

00:45.710 --> 00:49.353
...our team will analyze it, save it so you can use it every time you want to send a note.

00:49.599 --> 00:51.257
We care about everything...

00:51.355 --> 00:57.279
...from the paper that we're writing on, to the ink that we're using, to the pen, to the wax.

00:57.621 --> 01:00.623
Our goal at Bond is to build technology that helps people connect...

01:00.697 --> 01:03.077
...and, in the end, makes people happy.
