Growing up, I wasn't the richest but I had a rich family in spirit and support.

00:13.995 --> 00:18.915
Standing here with 19 championships is something I never thought would happen.

00:19.979 --> 00:25.136
I went on the courts with just a ball and a racket and a hope and that's all I had.

00:26.142 --> 00:29.610
It's inspiring for all you guys out there that wanna do something...

00:29.689 --> 00:31.317
...and wanna be the best that you can be...

00:31.393 --> 00:33.291
...and wanna do the best that you can do.

00:33.407 --> 00:36.261
You just never give up 'cause you never know what can happen.

00:36.340 --> 00:40.747
You never know who you can inspire and who you can influence.

00:40.847 --> 00:43.015
So I'm so honored.
