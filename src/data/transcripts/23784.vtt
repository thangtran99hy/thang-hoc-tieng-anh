While some plants specialized in repulsing animals,...

00:06.931 --> 00:09.441
...many others needed their collaboration and touch...

00:09.725 --> 00:12.021
...to be able to conquer faraway territories,...

00:12.351 --> 00:13.955
...to grow in new places.

00:17.405 --> 00:19.403
Seeds do not move by themselves,...

00:19.891 --> 00:23.377
...but an animal can turn into a transport vehicle for a small seed.

00:26.009 --> 00:30.965
In 1948, the Swiss engineer Georges de Mestral noticed this fact.

00:33.459 --> 00:36.311
After his peaceful walks with his dog in the countryside,...

00:36.609 --> 00:39.109
...he was fascinated by the strength that certain seeds use...

00:39.213 --> 00:42.861
...to attach themselves to his clothes, or to his four-legged friend's fur.

00:44.767 --> 00:47.415
In summertime, after a walk in the countryside,...

00:47.659 --> 00:52.615
...he always had to spend time removing an incredible variety of seeds from his socks and clothes.

00:54.269 --> 00:56.949
His curiosity took the engineer to study in detail...

00:57.061 --> 01:00.577
...the device by which these clandestine voyagers attach themselves...

01:00.709 --> 01:02.508
...through dozens of hooks to clothes.

01:07.285 --> 01:12.412
Thanks to this research, Mestral designed a well-known attachment system called Velcro.
