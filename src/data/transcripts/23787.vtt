ï»¿Pterodactyl is just one of many flying reptiles plying the skies of the Mesozoic.

00:17.387 --> 00:21.698
Her long beak is perfect for hunting fish and other aquatic animals.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.067
She carefully selects her prey, watching intently.

00:30.431 --> 00:36.883
But in the Mesozoic, sometimes the hunter becomes the hunted.

00:38.997 --> 00:41.113
Pterodactyl is exclusively carnivorous.

00:41.477 --> 00:45.058
So the lush, fruit-bearing trees of the shore are of little help.

00:46.411 --> 00:48.886
Perhaps these rock pools harbor less aggressive prey...

00:50.725 --> 00:52.715
...or perhaps not.

00:53.707 --> 00:54.737
Her hunt's successful, this majestic queen of the skies makes for home.
