00:10.347 --> 00:15.457
A member of the ornithopod family, this strange creature is pachycephalosaurus.

00:16.848 --> 00:20.896
Their formidable skulls are extremely thick, hardened for combat.

00:21.934 --> 00:24.515
Their nimble legs are built for high speed.

00:25.570 --> 00:28.819
These fierce beasts use these attributes to great advantage...

00:29.153 --> 00:31.341
...when the males joust for supremacy.

00:32.455 --> 00:34.511
There is still a chance one will submit.

00:38.001 --> 00:38.214
No!

00:38.926 --> 00:39.692
They charge,...

00:46.273 --> 00:48.671
...and both live to fight another day.
