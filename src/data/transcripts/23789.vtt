Occasionally, people come along who are not content with simply moving things along.

00:09.735 --> 00:11.376
They want to take things further,...

00:14.535 --> 00:16.528
...tear up the plans and start again,...

00:18.101 --> 00:20.153
...then take another brave step.

00:21.421 --> 00:24.805
They will see the future and knock down the walls to reach it,...

00:26.109 --> 00:28.445
...insist the dream is possible,...

00:30.409 --> 00:32.283
...overcome all indecision...

00:35.711 --> 00:38.257
...and take a running jump into the uncharted.

00:39.852 --> 00:45.219
Bored by reinvention of the superficial kind, they want more...

00:47.018 --> 00:50.580
...because their goal isn't to improve on what has been done before...

00:52.015 --> 00:54.800
...but to totally reimagine it.
