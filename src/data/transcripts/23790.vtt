00:00.038 --> 00:01.011
When I grow up,...

00:01.531 --> 00:02.522
...I want to be me.

00:03.187 --> 00:04.310
Now, I'm growing up...

00:04.648 --> 00:06.237
...and I've seen many things.

00:06.521 --> 00:09.667
I've been many mes and crossed many seas.

00:09.889 --> 00:12.183
But now that I'm getting old, there's one thing I know:...

00:12.275 --> 00:14.303
...I'll never grow up 'cause I'll never let go...

00:14.499 --> 00:15.559
...of when I was a kid...

00:15.761 --> 00:17.068
...and I played and I played...

00:17.585 --> 00:19.935
...and looked up to others because they knew their ways.

00:20.090 --> 00:24.538
Now as I look back as to who I am now, I lift up my chin and I lift it up proud.

00:24.836 --> 00:28.818
'Cause I have spent time and gone many miles.

00:29.308 --> 00:30.917
But as I stand here,...

00:31.149 --> 00:32.584
...I remain a child...

00:32.755 --> 00:35.601
...with so much to learn and more to explore.

00:35.905 --> 00:39.120
One day I'll grow up but now I want more.

00:39.554 --> 00:42.465
One day I'll grow up, or maybe I won't.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.741
Because grown-ups are dumb.

00:45.319 --> 00:46.569
So today, I'll be young.
