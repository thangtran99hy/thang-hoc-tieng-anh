00:08.645 --> 00:12.606
The lumbering ankylosaurus has a near impenetrable bony shell.

00:13.436 --> 00:18.229
	 Consequently, she's unwieldy but capable of surprising grace.

00:25.210 --> 00:29.984
This row of bony plates belongs to one of the most recognizable dinosaurs:...

00:30.910 --> 00:32.086
...stegosaurus.

00:33.456 --> 00:36.830
While the long-necked apatosaurus can reach high-level foliage,...

00:37.373 --> 00:41.396
...stegosaurus feeds predominantly on low-lying bushes and shrubs,...

00:42.284 --> 00:44.833
...so the two can coexist without conflict.

00:46.371 --> 00:48.735
Triceratops is grazing here too.

00:50.039 --> 00:54.933
This myopic ceratopsian might be seeing a challenger or a mate.

00:55.527 --> 00:56.356
We can't tell.

00:57.566 --> 00:59.667
His reaction is the same regardless.

01:00.196 --> 01:01.025
He charges.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.268
Stegosaurus's bulk, bony plates, defensive spikes and truly tiny brain,...

01:08.443 --> 01:11.257
...ensure that he has very little to worry about.
