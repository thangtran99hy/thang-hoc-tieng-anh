00:03.879 --> 00:05.407
Forensics finally released this.

00:06.883 --> 00:07.445
What is it?

00:07.891 --> 00:10.181
Personal effects they recovered from Skyfall.

00:14.875 --> 00:15.873
You've got a secret.

00:18.455 --> 00:23.085
Something you can't tell anyone because you don't trust anyone.

00:25.451 --> 00:29.007
I always knew death would wear a familiar face,...

00:30.187 --> 00:31.467
...but not yours.

00:33.797 --> 00:36.581
I was at a meeting recently and your name came up.

00:37.907 --> 00:40.727
I'm flattered London is still talking about me.

00:42.433 --> 00:43.767
It wasn't MI6.

00:49.618 --> 00:53.805
You're a kite dancing in a hurricane, Mr. Bond.
