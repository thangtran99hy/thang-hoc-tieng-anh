ï»¿It was the 15th of August 2011.

00:03.986 --> 00:05.469
I've received my A-level exam results...

00:05.531 --> 00:07.477
...and failed to get into the university of my choice.

00:08.483 --> 00:10.780
It's fair to say I was feeling pretty sorry for myself.

00:11.061 --> 00:12.231
I was pretty down low.

00:13.650 --> 00:14.673
So the rational part of my brain decided...

00:14.750 --> 00:17.611
...that the only way to solve this problem would be to buy a pet.

00:17.875 --> 00:18.998
Not a normal pet though.

00:19.138 --> 00:20.480
No, it needed to be something different.

00:20.595 --> 00:21.830
Something exciting.

00:22.031 --> 00:24.608
So I went online and did a bit of research and came across this:...

00:25.021 --> 00:25.968
...a bearded dragon.

00:26.373 --> 00:27.147
It was perfect.

00:27.501 --> 00:30.347
I always remember that moment placing the box on my desk and opening it up.

00:31.226 --> 00:31.983
It was glorious.

00:32.274 --> 00:33.195
He was perfect.

00:33.329 --> 00:34.723
I called him Sid.
