00:00.389 --> 00:01.571
Are we weirdos?

00:02.418 --> 00:07.519
Can we be obsessive, fanatical, extreme?

00:08.118 --> 00:09.663
Okay, maybe just a little.

00:10.271 --> 00:16.251
But maybe you have to be crazy to want to spend every day beaten, and muddy, and sore.

00:16.953 --> 00:17.705
And for what?

00:17.861 --> 00:18.949
Why do we do it?

00:19.237 --> 00:22.563
Well we're not out here flipping tires to be better tire flippers.

00:23.427 --> 00:26.250
We're doing it to be better, period.

00:28.239 --> 00:31.830
Better leaders, better parents.

00:32.701 --> 00:38.227
Better, stronger, more determined humans.

00:39.101 --> 00:41.156
Capable of anything.

00:42.835 --> 00:47.706
To honor our bodies and sharpen our minds.

00:48.577 --> 00:52.111
To be more human.
