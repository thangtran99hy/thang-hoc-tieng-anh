Unlike many proverbs, the one about elephant memory is scientifically accurate.

00:11.620 --> 00:13.609
Elephants know every member in their herd,...

00:13.991 --> 00:17.835
...able to recognize as many as 30 companions by sight or smell.

00:18.897 --> 00:20.558
This is a great help when migrating...

00:20.651 --> 00:23.471
...or encountering other potentially hostile elephants.

00:24.163 --> 00:27.865
They also remember and distinguish particular cues that signal danger...

00:28.582 --> 00:31.897
...and can recall important locations long after their last visit.

00:32.886 --> 00:36.516
But it's the memories unrelated to survival that are the most fascinating.

00:37.505 --> 00:40.322
Elephants remember not only their herd companions...

00:40.785 --> 00:43.904
...but other creatures who have made a strong impression on them.

00:44.913 --> 00:48.923
In one case, two circus elephants that had briefly performed together...

00:49.331 --> 00:52.602
...rejoiced when crossing paths 23 years later.

00:53.843 --> 00:56.736
This recognition isn't limited to others of their species.

00:57.526 --> 01:01.661
Elephants have also recognized humans they've bonded with after decades apart.

01:02.325 --> 01:06.528
All of this shows that elephant memory goes beyond responses to stimuli.
