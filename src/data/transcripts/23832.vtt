We're obsessed with our cellphones.

00:02.993 --> 00:04.267
Sometimes for good reasons,...

00:05.329 --> 00:09.689
...other times, we check for likes and check and check.

00:10.407 --> 00:13.589
Or read intriguing articles about, well, never mind.

00:14.453 --> 00:15.692
And have you been out to dinner lately?

00:16.534 --> 00:18.213
We think we can't live without our phones.

00:19.047 --> 00:20.584
So why don't we use them to help provide...

00:20.647 --> 00:24.143
...something people actually can't live without: clean water.

00:24.666 --> 00:27.771
At uniceftapproject.org, you can do just that.

00:28.352 --> 00:30.112
Give clean water to a child in need...

00:30.485 --> 00:32.589
...by taking a challenge to not touch your phone.

00:33.324 --> 00:34.731
The longer you go without your phone,...

00:35.109 --> 00:37.282
...the more you can help UNICEF put children first...

00:37.757 --> 00:39.447
...by providing them with clean water.

00:40.233 --> 00:43.721
15 minutes can help provide a child with clean water for a day.

00:44.279 --> 00:45.977
Every minute counts, so keep going.
