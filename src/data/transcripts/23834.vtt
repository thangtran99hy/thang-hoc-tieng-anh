00:00.176 --> 00:05.600
If your dream is to ride the tallest, steepest and fastest water slide in the world,...

00:06.098 --> 00:08.340
...then feast your eyes on Verruckt.

00:08.627 --> 00:13.682
This 17-story thrill ride is now at Schlitterbahn Water Park in Kansas City.

00:14.354 --> 00:19.391
Coming in at around 170 feet, it's taller than Niagara Falls...

00:19.702 --> 00:21.875
...and steeper than any ski slopes.

00:22.593 --> 00:27.537
The only way up to the top is climbing up 264 stairs.

00:28.293 --> 00:31.198
Incidentally, "verruckt" means "insane" in German.

00:31.983 --> 00:35.834
I guess that really is the best word to describe these crazy rides.
