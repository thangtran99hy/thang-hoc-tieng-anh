00:00.565 --> 00:04.905
I was designed to save the world.

00:07.051 --> 00:12.331
People would look to the sky and see hope.

00:16.133 --> 00:18.063
I'll take that from them first.

00:21.036 --> 00:23.126
There's only one path to peace:...

00:25.213 --> 00:26.437
...their extinction.

00:31.463 --> 00:33.931
I tried to create a suit of armor around the world,...

00:34.945 --> 00:36.749
...but I created something terrible.

00:37.385 --> 00:38.727
Artificial intelligence.

00:41.715 --> 00:42.872
It's called the "Ultron Program."

00:48.415 --> 00:49.073
Here we all are,...

00:51.519 --> 00:54.764
...with nothing but our wit and our will to save the world.

00:55.274 --> 00:56.677
So stand and fight.

00:58.841 --> 01:00.199
We can tear them apart...

01:04.023 --> 01:05.188
...from the inside.
