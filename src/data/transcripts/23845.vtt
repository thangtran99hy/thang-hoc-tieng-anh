ï»¿The human population is constantly growing.

00:02.630 --> 00:06.064
And it maybe time to look into other places to live including underwater.

00:06.650 --> 00:09.039
A Japan-based construction company has unveiled its design...

00:09.350 --> 00:12.583
...for a subaquatic city that can accommodate up to 5,000 residents.

00:13.047 --> 00:15.607
The proposed city is being called the Ocean Spiral.

00:16.164 --> 00:17.684
Three sections will make up the structure.

00:17.883 --> 00:21.887
A floating sphere or pod that has a diameter of nearly 1650 feet...

00:22.200 --> 00:24.135
...will rest just beneath the surface of the ocean.

00:24.535 --> 00:27.026
The pod will contain both residences and businesses...

00:27.280 --> 00:29.677
...with a spiral path connecting the sphere to the seabed.

00:30.125 --> 00:33.600
This will allow scientists to utilize energy resources from the ocean floor.
