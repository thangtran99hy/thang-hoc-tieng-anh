00:01.416 --> 00:03.016
How do you hit it better than that?

00:03.407 --> 00:05.576
Well Rory, you could change drivers.

00:05.911 --> 00:06.600
But I don't want to.

00:06.899 --> 00:07.224
Yes, you do.

00:07.543 --> 00:08.895
But I already hit it far.

00:09.235 --> 00:09.702
Hit it farther.

00:09.829 --> 00:10.928
But I won the US Open.

00:11.081 --> 00:12.556
Awesome, win more Opens.

00:12.638 --> 00:13.667
But I've won 14 majors.

00:13.935 --> 00:14.965
15 sounds nice?

00:15.235 --> 00:16.329
But my swing is perfect.

00:17.175 --> 00:17.728
Get the club!

00:18.000 --> 00:18.771
Well, Bo knows.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.175
Yeah, we know, Bo.

00:20.476 --> 00:21.905
You can get a little better.

00:22.109 --> 00:23.777
You, sir, could get a big better.

00:24.100 --> 00:26.149
Now that I think about it, all of you can get better.

00:26.296 --> 00:27.768
The Nike Vapor Driver.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.257
There's always better.
