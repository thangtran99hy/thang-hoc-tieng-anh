I think my color blindness was discovered when I was at kindergarten.

00:05.837 --> 00:11.106
I was drawing my flowers brown and my oceans black and skies were purple.

00:11.682 --> 00:13.573
I was officially diagnosed first grade.

00:14.118 --> 00:16.967
I think it's like 0.5 percent that a girl is actually color-blind.

00:24.811 --> 00:27.037
So, this is what it really looks like to you guys?

00:27.994 --> 00:30.649
For a second I felt kind of sad, like wow.

00:31.470 --> 00:34.404
I kind of have been missing out on how vibrant everything has been.

00:34.529 --> 00:37.513
And then I thought, but how cool it is...

00:37.700 --> 00:41.037
...that I now get the opportunity to see the world in a completely different way,...

00:41.123 --> 00:42.325
...and it's special to me.
