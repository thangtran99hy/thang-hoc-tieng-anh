00:00.817 --> 00:02.275
ï»¿What's the point of travel?

00:02.670 --> 00:04.927
It's to help make us into better people.

00:05.427 --> 00:06.881
It's a sort of therapy.

00:07.406 --> 00:12.172
Without anything mystical being meant by this, all of us are, in one way or another,...

00:12.567 --> 00:14.991
...on what can be termed an "inner journey."

00:15.575 --> 00:18.263
That is, we're trying to develop in particular ways.

00:18.837 --> 00:22.067
In a nutshell, the point of travel is to go to places...

00:22.235 --> 00:24.806
...that can help us in our inner evolution.

00:25.253 --> 00:28.427
The outer journey should assist us with the inner one.

00:30.499 --> 00:33.210
Every location in the world contains qualities...

00:33.274 --> 00:37.065
...that can support some kind of beneficial change inside a person.

00:37.677 --> 00:43.019
In an ideal world, travel agencies will be manned by a new kind of psychotherapist.

00:43.575 --> 00:45.957
They'd take care not just of the flights and the hotels,...

00:46.246 --> 00:50.697
...they'd start by finding out what was wrong with us and how we might want to change.

00:51.305 --> 00:54.122
We need to relearn how to be ambitious about travel,...

00:54.586 --> 00:59.115
...seeing it as a way of helping us to grow into better versions of ourselves.
