There are many ways to make networking contacts.

00:05.055 --> 00:11.149
LinkedIn, which now has 170 million people worldwide is an excellent resource,...

00:11.298 --> 00:15.883
...so try to use LinkedIn as a proactive research tool.

00:16.054 --> 00:18.052
Join groups, connect with people.

00:18.241 --> 00:24.249
So the best way to keep up with your contacts is to conduct a series of informational meetings.

00:24.605 --> 00:29.475
Ideally, these would be face-to-face in person meetings, 20 to 30 minutes.

00:29.631 --> 00:33.991
What you're doing is you're not asking for a job, but you're trying to uncover needs.

00:34.487 --> 00:38.193
It's also important to develop a professional introduction.

00:38.468 --> 00:43.993
This is a brief, concise introductory message that markets and promotes you.

00:44.234 --> 00:45.939
It basically has three components.

00:46.265 --> 00:47.767
You're stating your name,...

00:48.100 --> 00:50.470
...your role, perhaps you're a student, you're a professional,...

00:50.850 --> 00:56.005
...your career interest, what you have to offer and most importantly, next steps.
