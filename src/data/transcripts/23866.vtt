00:02.102 --> 00:07.076
ï»¿I think I was always misunderstood.

00:07.857 --> 00:10.210
People just didn't seem to like me.

00:12.691 --> 00:14.641
I think I annoyed them.

00:15.105 --> 00:16.485
I got on their nerves.

00:19.580 --> 00:20.644
I don't know why.

00:23.236 --> 00:24.465
That's just the way it was.

00:29.084 --> 00:29.824
Yeah.

00:32.798 --> 00:36.711
Maybe I was too intense.

00:40.038 --> 00:43.237
Maybe I came on too strong.

00:47.845 --> 00:48.942
I don't know.

00:50.347 --> 00:51.612
I really can't say.

00:56.043 --> 00:59.940
Yeah, it was lonely, really lonely.

01:01.342 --> 01:08.539
But you'll get used to it after a while.

01:13.105 --> 01:17.659
And then one day, everything changed.

01:19.468 --> 01:25.494
Somebody finally accepted me for what I am.

01:28.743 --> 01:34.561
Since I've got this job, life is completely different.

01:35.283 --> 01:37.665
I finally feel useful,...

01:38.534 --> 01:40.523
...good at something.
