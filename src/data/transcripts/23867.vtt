We had an option of two pathways to walk.

00:04.058 --> 00:05.711
And they led to two doorways.

00:07.066 --> 00:12.093
Am I choosing because of what's constantly bombarded at me,...

00:12.276 --> 00:16.561
...what I'm being told that I should accept?

00:17.002 --> 00:19.862
Or am I choosing because that's what I really believe?

00:20.098 --> 00:24.197
I walked into that door that said "average" and I didn't feel really good after that.

00:25.401 --> 00:29.499
Because, obviously, I had rated myself average and nobody else.

00:31.685 --> 00:33.281
Beautiful is a great word.

00:35.203 --> 00:38.311
So, why not see what's on the other side of that?
