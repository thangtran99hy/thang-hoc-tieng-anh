00:00.703 --> 00:02.279
Curious how good your eyesight is?

00:02.498 --> 00:04.129
Take a look at this image.

00:04.437 --> 00:05.130
Who do you see?

00:05.409 --> 00:08.892
If you're at a normal viewing distance from the screen and have decent eyesight...

00:09.132 --> 00:11.370
...you should be seeing Albert Einstein.

00:11.625 --> 00:13.312
However, if you're seeing Marilyn Monroe...

00:13.460 --> 00:16.552
...you may wanna consider wearing glasses or contacts.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.327
Wearing your glasses right now?

00:18.601 --> 00:20.913
Try taking them off and the image may change.

00:21.213 --> 00:23.854
Or if you're near somebody else, ask them what they see.

00:24.092 --> 00:25.915
The effect can actually be seen by anyone...

00:26.016 --> 00:28.414
...if we change the distance or size of the picture.

00:28.825 --> 00:31.421
If it's far away, you're more likely to see Marilyn Monroe...

00:31.707 --> 00:34.831
...as our eyes only pick up the broader strokes of an image from a distance.

00:35.080 --> 00:38.985
But as you come closer to the image, you see the finer details of Einstein.

00:39.395 --> 00:41.425
We promise, we haven't changed anything digitally.

00:41.658 --> 00:45.383
In fact, pause this video now and try walking away from your computer screen.

00:45.740 --> 00:47.480
Chances are, the image will change...

00:47.803 --> 00:49.562
...and at a different distance than your friends...

00:49.667 --> 00:51.469
...because our eyes are all slightly different.

00:51.827 --> 00:54.104
The further away you can stand and still see Einstein...

00:54.440 --> 00:55.902
...the better your eyes likely are.

00:56.335 --> 00:59.590
You can achieve the same effect by squinting your eyes to blur the photo.
