Alright, you guys.

00:07.971 --> 00:08.546
Hey, here we go.

00:09.294 --> 00:09.827
Right there.

00:10.706 --> 00:11.148
Let me have that.

00:11.406 --> 00:13.434
You are going to be 20 minutes late.

00:13.700 --> 00:14.737
Is everyone gonna be there on time?

00:15.108 --> 00:15.485
Yes.

00:16.465 --> 00:17.278
Join the meeting for me.

00:18.753 --> 00:19.789
Alright, hey guys, I'm here.

00:20.696 --> 00:21.249
Good morning, Arthur.

00:21.361 --> 00:22.201
Thank you for joining us.

00:22.281 --> 00:23.326
We've got Mia in the field.

00:23.399 --> 00:23.895
Good morning.

00:24.255 --> 00:24.569
Mia,...

00:24.695 --> 00:25.775
...what section are you in again?

00:26.259 --> 00:27.336
I'm in the northwest section.

00:31.275 --> 00:31.857
Terry, come on.

00:33.779 --> 00:34.257
Hey guys.

00:34.766 --> 00:35.459
Good morning.

00:35.877 --> 00:36.175
Hey.

00:39.647 --> 00:42.215
Can you give us a quick pan of the area please?

00:44.585 --> 00:45.691
Hey Mia, can you hold that for a second?

00:46.727 --> 00:49.332
I think that's a peregrine falcon's nest.

00:52.988 --> 00:53.441
Could be.

00:54.071 --> 00:55.254
Let me get a picture real quick.
