Style is being able to wear what you want to wear...

00:09.890 --> 00:11.349
...because it makes sense to you.

00:11.458 --> 00:13.382
I mean when something is good, it's just good.

00:13.522 --> 00:14.488
This is your life.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.732
You can't let anyone else direct your life.

00:16.778 --> 00:17.639
Your life is your movie,...

00:17.740 --> 00:19.163
...and that's where the equality comes in.

00:19.347 --> 00:21.609
You should be able to do whatever it is that you want to do.

00:21.684 --> 00:23.402
As long as you're not harming anyone else,...

00:23.476 --> 00:25.411
...why shouldn't you be able to express yourself?
