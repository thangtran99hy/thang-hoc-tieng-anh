Sometimes, changes like a new school year can mean new feelings...

00:07.773 --> 00:09.391
...for an old person in your life.

00:09.861 --> 00:11.750
But what if you don't know how someone feels about you?

00:12.370 --> 00:14.285
It may take a little detective work.

00:14.828 --> 00:18.116
Take note of when this potential crush talks to you at school.

00:18.429 --> 00:21.497
If it's just in front of friends then it may be flirting for attention.

00:21.857 --> 00:24.923
But if no one else is around then it may be an effort on his part...

00:25.029 --> 00:26.087
...to get to know you more.

00:26.345 --> 00:28.090
Sometimes, the clues are online.

00:28.387 --> 00:31.139
Does he constantly like your selfies or comment on your post?

00:31.396 --> 00:33.325
That could mean he wants to know more.

00:33.593 --> 00:35.915
Create alone time that doesn't feel like a date.

00:36.350 --> 00:37.557
Plan a study session together.

00:37.963 --> 00:40.461
This way, if there isn't actual chemistry between you two,...

00:40.686 --> 00:42.837
...at least there will be progress on that chemistry homework.
