I'm Bradford Shellhammer and I travel the world helping businesses unleash their creativity.

00:11.987 --> 00:12.840
That's what I do for a living,...

00:12.943 --> 00:14.998
...which is not a real job but it works for me.

00:16.129 --> 00:19.397
I feel like I discover a creative solution to problems every single day,...

00:19.680 --> 00:21.000
...but the creative solution for me...

00:21.300 --> 00:24.289
...was to actually not control or micromanage everything in my life.

00:24.555 --> 00:29.423
And I realized that creative individuals and creative professionals are much better...

00:29.580 --> 00:32.300
...and much more productive when they empower people around them...

00:32.580 --> 00:35.900
...to actually do the work rather than try and hold everything so close to them.

00:36.283 --> 00:38.971
So, something I've really learned the last couple of years...

00:39.259 --> 00:44.698
..is how to unleash or allow the creativity of other people to outshine my own.

00:44.998 --> 00:49.671
And together we build something that one single designer and/or creative person couldn't do.
