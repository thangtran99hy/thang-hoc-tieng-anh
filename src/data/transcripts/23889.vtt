If you're a young person like I used to be,...

00:03.491 --> 00:07.343
...and you're at home watching and you're being called weird or you're being called different,...

00:07.563 --> 00:09.020
...or whatever the hell you're being called,...

00:09.095 --> 00:11.890
...I'm here tonight to tell you: your critics do not count.

00:12.266 --> 00:14.605
Their words will fade, you won't.

00:15.189 --> 00:18.820
Stay foolish, stay hungry, dream, work hard,...

00:18.897 --> 00:22.889
...and, who knows, maybe someday, you'll find yourself standing on a stage...

00:23.149 --> 00:27.935
...and maybe someday, somebody will be giving you an award, calling you an innovator.
