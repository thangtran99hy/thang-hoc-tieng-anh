ï»¿Being a dairy farmer is really hard.

00:04.276 --> 00:07.553
There're not as many young people wanting to become farmers.

00:08.279 --> 00:10.819
A man from Sainsbury's, he buys their milk,...

00:11.150 --> 00:12.517
...saw how tough it was.

00:17.823 --> 00:22.480
So, he got over 300 farmers together to see how he could help.

00:24.781 --> 00:26.897
They had lots of great ideas.

00:29.707 --> 00:31.359
A new way to trim our toenails.

00:32.637 --> 00:34.367
How to use less electricity.

00:36.944 --> 00:40.278
The Sainsbury's man was amazed and got lots of people together...

00:40.435 --> 00:42.161
...to help bring their ideas to life.

00:42.664 --> 00:44.158
That was six years ago.

00:44.905 --> 00:47.915
Now most cows are much happier and making lots more milk.

00:49.866 --> 00:54.188
Sainsbury's got our farmers a really good price for it, so they're happy.

00:54.682 --> 00:56.949
Now all their kids want to be farmers too.

00:58.938 --> 01:02.617
So, we'll have lots of lovely British milk for ages.

01:04.636 --> 01:05.342
Sainsbury's.

01:05.589 --> 01:07.468
You're welcome at the barn anytime.
