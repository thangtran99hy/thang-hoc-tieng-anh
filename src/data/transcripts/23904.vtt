00:00.702 --> 00:05.129
Los Angeles Griffith Observatory captured this stunning time-lapse footage...

00:05.213 --> 00:09.893
...of a total lunar eclipse that took place in the early hours of Saturday morning.

00:11.207 --> 00:15.980
The moon slipped fully into the Earth's shadow at 4:58 AM local time,...

00:16.296 --> 00:19.493
...starting an eclipse which lasted for nearly five minutes,...

00:20.008 --> 00:23.526
...but according to NASA will be the shortest eclipse for a century.

00:25.419 --> 00:30.265
As the moon passed into the Earth's shadow, it turned a sort of burnt orange in color...

00:30.679 --> 00:33.801
...which has earned this celestial event the nickname of a "Blood Moon."
