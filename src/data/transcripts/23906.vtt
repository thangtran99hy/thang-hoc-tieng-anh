So, the first universal principle of influence is reciprocity.

00:04.135 --> 00:08.114
Simply put, people are obliged to give back to others the form of behavior,...

00:08.277 --> 00:10.973
...gift or service that they have received first.

00:11.686 --> 00:14.665
If a friend invites you to their party, there's an obligation for you...

00:14.727 --> 00:17.010
...to invite them to a future party you are hosting.

00:17.491 --> 00:21.084
If a colleague does you a favor, then you owe that colleague a favor.

00:21.313 --> 00:23.604
And in the context of a social obligation,...

00:23.876 --> 00:27.053
...people are more likely to say "yes" to those that they owe.

00:27.913 --> 00:30.801
The second universal principle of persuasion is scarcity.

00:31.434 --> 00:34.533
Simply put, people want more of those things they can have less of.

00:35.419 --> 00:40.419
When British Airways announced in 2003 that they would no longer be operating...

00:40.496 --> 00:43.467
...the twice-daily Londonâ€‘New York Concorde flight...

00:43.889 --> 00:50.659
...because it had become uneconomical to run, sales the very next day took off.
