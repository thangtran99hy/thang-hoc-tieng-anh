00:00.134 --> 00:04.763
In yet another cue from nature, a German company has developed bionic butterflies...

00:05.020 --> 00:08.981
...that look and fly like the real thing even in proximity to each other.

00:09.565 --> 00:13.035
Weighing little more than an ounce but with a wingspan of around 20 inches,...

00:13.381 --> 00:17.264
...each butterfly is equipped with two motors, two batteries, infrared markers...

00:17.351 --> 00:19.656
...and wings made up of soft elastic material.

00:20.174 --> 00:22.390
Designed as a technology research platform,...

00:22.729 --> 00:25.125
...a demonstration shows them flying around a room,...

00:25.385 --> 00:27.759
...installed with ten cameras, infrared tracking...

00:28.008 --> 00:30.416
...and a central computer which coordinates their movement.

00:30.917 --> 00:33.607
Several are in motion simultaneously at the same time,...

00:33.890 --> 00:37.457
...and the real-time communications prevent potentially damaging collisions.

00:37.935 --> 00:41.827
The devices were not developed to sell but represent continued research efforts...

00:41.911 --> 00:45.021
...towards making ultralight networked robotic systems.
