00:01.541 --> 00:06.633
Hey kids, now we're going to write the letter A as in ant.

00:07.270 --> 00:09.207
A, a, ant.

00:10.739 --> 00:13.063
First, we'll write the capital A.

00:13.593 --> 00:14.807
That's the big A.

00:16.424 --> 00:19.589
Start at the top and make a line down.

00:21.573 --> 00:25.201
Go back to the top and make another line down.

00:27.235 --> 00:31.612
Now, go to the middle and make a line across.

00:33.781 --> 00:35.075
Let's try it again.

00:36.829 --> 00:41.431
Down, down, across.

00:42.657 --> 00:43.999
Now you try.

00:48.455 --> 00:50.959
Now, we're going to write the lowercase a.

00:51.955 --> 00:53.427
That's the small a.

00:54.945 --> 00:58.489
Start in the middle and go all the way around.

01:00.805 --> 01:04.623
Next, go up and then down.

01:06.953 --> 01:08.080
Let's try it again.

01:10.085 --> 01:14.325
Around, up and down.

01:15.948 --> 01:16.976
Now you try!
