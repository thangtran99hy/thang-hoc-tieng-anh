A while back, I was really angry at my little brother,...

00:02.207 --> 00:04.667
...so I started yelling at him and then I went and pushed him really hard.

00:05.252 --> 00:07.253
He got back up and started to cry and did nothing.

00:07.488 --> 00:09.388
All he did was run towards me and then hug me.

00:09.696 --> 00:12.327
When he hugged me, it awakened me and I felt so bad...

00:12.407 --> 00:13.743
...when I realized what I was doing.

00:14.035 --> 00:16.413
So I hugged him back tightly and I told him that I was really sorry.

00:16.643 --> 00:18.861
He fought back with love, and it worked.

00:19.131 --> 00:20.873
We're all built and ready to love.

00:21.171 --> 00:22.824
If a baby could do it, so can we.

00:23.163 --> 00:23.895
We need love.

00:24.049 --> 00:25.089
Love isn't selfish.

00:25.317 --> 00:26.293
It's for the other person.

00:26.601 --> 00:29.149
It's what we do for someone that brings out their happiness,...

00:29.831 --> 00:31.336
...in turn bringing out ours.

00:31.671 --> 00:34.321
Love was always about the other person, not ourselves.
