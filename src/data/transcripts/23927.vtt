Let's take a look inside the home of one of the many tech entrepreneurial giants...

00:04.155 --> 00:05.261
...living in the Mission District.

00:05.435 --> 00:06.109
Come on up!

00:06.442 --> 00:07.783
You're younger than I thought you'd be.

00:08.376 --> 00:08.814
What's your name?

00:08.996 --> 00:09.507
Max.

00:09.623 --> 00:09.895
Max?

00:12.132 --> 00:15.979
I bought the place in 2011 when the market was down.

00:16.251 --> 00:18.291
You must've been two or three when you made that deal.

00:18.502 --> 00:19.718
You have a lot of really nice stuff here.

00:19.803 --> 00:21.299
What's your favorite piece in the house?

00:21.384 --> 00:21.737
There.

00:22.093 --> 00:22.454
Over there?

00:23.093 --> 00:23.984
My friend made it,...

00:24.108 --> 00:24.782
...he's six.

00:25.306 --> 00:26.909
So, you have two guest bedrooms here?

00:26.999 --> 00:28.109
For sleepovers!

00:28.237 --> 00:29.188
This is your bedroom?

00:29.333 --> 00:29.711
Yeah.

00:30.223 --> 00:30.733
Wow!

00:30.900 --> 00:32.421
This is like the size of my apartment.

00:32.497 --> 00:34.089
This is where I like to meditate.

00:34.517 --> 00:35.864
Excuse me for a second.

00:37.368 --> 00:38.212
How are you so driven?

00:38.609 --> 00:38.927
What?

00:40.095 --> 00:41.342
I said, how are you so driven?

00:41.761 --> 00:43.873
I just want to make the world a better place.
