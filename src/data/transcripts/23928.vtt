In the current coffee industry, a coffee farmer has two big problems.

00:04.014 --> 00:08.027
First, they lose control of their product when they sell their coffee fruit.

00:08.719 --> 00:12.234
And afterwards, there is buying and selling between middlemen along the chain,...

00:12.836 --> 00:15.671
...from importers and exporters to roasters.

00:16.537 --> 00:19.853
But the farmer sees none of the revenue created by this buying and selling.

00:20.461 --> 00:23.686
What if we connect farmers to a supply chain where a farmer is involved...

00:23.769 --> 00:25.565
...from his crop all the way to the consumer.

00:26.291 --> 00:29.611
Provide a revenue sharing model with fixed percentages of revenue...

00:29.913 --> 00:33.115
...that are tied to quality and not tied to the commodities market.

00:33.686 --> 00:35.662
With Thrive Farmers, this is now possible.

00:35.949 --> 00:37.415
So, now it's time to do your part.

00:38.015 --> 00:40.441
Know the story of your coffee and where it comes from.

00:40.905 --> 00:45.259
Choose specialty grade roasters that deal directly with farmers, and spread the word.
