00:00.311 --> 00:01.699
Of course, this is so nice.

00:02.101 --> 00:03.705
You know, I actually walked here all the way from Brooklyn...

00:03.784 --> 00:04.941
...because it's so beautiful today.

00:05.159 --> 00:07.007
Oh yeah, New York is gorgeous in the spring.

00:07.511 --> 00:09.016
Spring has officially sprung.

00:10.909 --> 00:11.835
Winter is coming.

00:16.832 --> 00:18.050
Who's your new friend again, Seth?

00:18.833 --> 00:22.370
This is Jon and Jon actually I think winter is over and we're headed into spring now.

00:22.447 --> 00:23.501
Winter is coming.

00:25.779 --> 00:26.199
Okay.

00:26.987 --> 00:28.684
The snow fall a hundred feet deep.

00:30.269 --> 00:31.917
The ice wind'll howl out the north.

00:32.634 --> 00:34.570
And the sun hides its face for years...

00:34.648 --> 00:37.435
...and little children will all be born and die in the darkness.

00:40.804 --> 00:42.072
So much for global warming.
