ï»¿Is it really surprising...

00:12.374 --> 00:17.611
...that the most powerful man in the world should be a figure of controversy?

00:18.364 --> 00:21.881
We, as a population on this planet, have been looking for a savior.

00:22.803 --> 00:24.743
The world has been so caught up with what he can do,...

00:24.909 --> 00:26.589
...that no one has asked what he should do.

00:32.607 --> 00:34.001
That's how it starts:...

00:36.313 --> 00:38.799
...the fever, the rage,...

00:40.456 --> 00:48.543
...the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men cruel.

00:52.329 --> 00:54.553
Tell me, do you bleed?

00:58.473 --> 00:59.182
You will.
