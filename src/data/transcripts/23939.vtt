00:49.201 --> 00:53.826
"You, the mothers, who have sent your sons from faraway countries,..."

00:54.258 --> 00:55.525
"...wipe away your tears."

00:56.214 --> 00:59.581
"Your sons are now lying in our bosom and are at peace."

01:00.140 --> 01:04.606
After having lost their lives in this land, they have become our sons as well.
