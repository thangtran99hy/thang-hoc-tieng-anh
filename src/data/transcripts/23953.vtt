00:02.979 --> 00:04.677
I'm getting ready for a lot of things.

00:06.856 --> 00:07.590
A lot of things.

00:08.401 --> 00:11.199
It's spring so we're starting to get the gardens ready,...

00:11.416 --> 00:15.086
...and my tomatoes are legendary here in my own neighborhood.

00:16.985 --> 00:19.564
My daughter is about to start kindergarten next year,...

00:20.030 --> 00:23.349
...and so we're moving just so she can belong to a better school.

00:24.517 --> 00:26.108
I'm getting ready to do something, too.

00:26.965 --> 00:28.215
I'm running for president.

00:29.807 --> 00:33.220
Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times,...

00:33.521 --> 00:36.713
...but the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top.

00:37.545 --> 00:40.841
Every day Americans need a champion and I wanna be that champion.

00:41.183 --> 00:44.428
So you can do more than just get by; you can get ahead...

00:44.725 --> 00:45.716
...and stay ahead.

00:46.235 --> 00:49.295
Because when families are strong, America is strong.

00:53.001 --> 00:55.443
So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote.

00:56.165 --> 00:57.527
Because it's your time,...

00:58.437 --> 01:00.723
...and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
