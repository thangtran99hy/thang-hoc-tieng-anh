ï»¿If the place is beautiful, it seduces you.

00:08.036 --> 00:11.341
The ambience is set not just with comfortable furniture.

00:11.601 --> 00:15.647
Every detail from the pressed tablecloth and napkin, the candelabra,....

00:15.746 --> 00:19.424
...the flowers on the table and, of course, the silverware,...

00:20.109 --> 00:24.070
...where everything seems natural like it belongs, but crucial is the lighting.

00:25.899 --> 00:28.882
Lighting is probably the most imperceptible detail,...

00:29.397 --> 00:32.065
...that, if the lighting is great, you don't know it.

00:32.197 --> 00:33.785
If the lighting is awful, you sure know it.

00:34.978 --> 00:36.673
To me, flowers represent life.

00:37.096 --> 00:37.597
Quite simple.

00:38.171 --> 00:40.339
And it also makes you aware, even in the city,...

00:40.935 --> 00:44.367
...that it's possible to cultivate a garden even in the most urban of settings.
