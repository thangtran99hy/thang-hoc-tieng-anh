Okay, today I'm going to show you how to let yourself go.

00:05.531 --> 00:06.505
I hope you like it.

00:06.781 --> 00:08.609
And if you don't, I don't care.

00:09.293 --> 00:11.056
The first step to letting yourself go...

00:11.151 --> 00:14.931
...is finding a comfortable pair of sweatpants with an elastic waistband.

00:15.261 --> 00:16.977
You may want to skip washing them too.

00:17.113 --> 00:19.282
The more stains and cat hair, the better.

00:20.133 --> 00:22.388
Red lipstick always makes a statement...

00:22.934 --> 00:23.802
...like this one.

00:24.919 --> 00:28.681
If you really want to turn heads, you can use this new fragrance from France.

00:28.945 --> 00:30.943
Me? I just use fresh laundry.

00:34.354 --> 00:39.711
If you're too lazy to get the remote, I recommend fashioning a long poking device like this one.

00:43.882 --> 00:47.871
Oh, and I'm just obsessed with this new volumizing hair dryer I just bought.

00:49.036 --> 00:50.695
I just can't even...

00:51.145 --> 00:56.784
Now the trick to getting the perfect bedhead look is to basically not get out of bed.

00:57.027 --> 00:58.513
I think I'm just gonna take a nap.

00:58.850 --> 01:04.831
