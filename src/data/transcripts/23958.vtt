00:00.057 --> 00:00.968
Yeah, I'm married.

00:01.221 --> 00:02.024
Does it matter?

00:02.527 --> 00:03.356
You'd do that for me?

00:03.983 --> 00:06.081
Really? Yeah, I'd like that.

00:06.179 --> 00:06.896
Who are you talking to?

00:07.303 --> 00:09.133
It's Jake from State Farm.

00:09.214 --> 00:10.287
Sounds like a really good deal.

00:10.363 --> 00:12.321
Jake from State Farm, at 3:00 in the morning?

00:12.411 --> 00:12.869
Who is this?

00:13.019 --> 00:14.929
It's Jake from State Farm.

00:15.121 --> 00:17.680
What are you wearing, Jake from State Farm?

00:19.523 --> 00:20.270
Khakis.

00:20.874 --> 00:22.364
She sounds hideous.

00:22.445 --> 00:23.603
Well, she's a guy, so...

00:24.680 --> 00:27.247
Another reason more people stay with State Farm.

00:27.519 --> 00:28.949
Get to a better state.
