We're both graduating from the Electrical Computer Engineering Department...

00:03.728 --> 00:06.352
...at George Mason University this coming May.

00:06.767 --> 00:08.814
We're here, we're just gonna test out our device...

00:08.931 --> 00:12.364
...that we use that uses sound frequencies to extinguish flames.

00:13.803 --> 00:16.103
I see this device being applied to a lot of things.

00:16.201 --> 00:19.735
First off, I think in the kitchen, it can be on top of the stove top,...

00:20.585 --> 00:24.496
...but eventually I'd like to see this applied to, maybe, swarm robotics,...

00:24.569 --> 00:28.919
...where it'd be attached to a drone and that would be applied to forest fires...

00:29.005 --> 00:33.125
...or even building fires where you wouldn't want to sacrifice human life.

00:33.683 --> 00:35.823
Professor Brian Mark really stepped in to help us.

00:36.143 --> 00:37.539
He just gave us a lot of support.

00:38.075 --> 00:46.103
I think as a whole, engineering is really just finding simple solutions to complicated problems.
