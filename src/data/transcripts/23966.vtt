00:00.315 --> 00:02.780
You give your life away so others will live,...

00:03.975 --> 00:06.485
...and take life, where only God can give it.

00:11.306 --> 00:12.849
What the hell are they doing here?

00:15.027 --> 00:18.086
Government's found a compound that kills humans and nothing else.

00:18.569 --> 00:19.803
I hear you need a ship.

00:20.813 --> 00:21.838
I only work better alone.

00:22.516 --> 00:23.450
You shouldn't fear me.

00:25.513 --> 00:26.717
Ready to go to hell, colonel?

00:28.027 --> 00:30.077
Never thought we'd set foot on the Halo ring.

00:31.269 --> 00:32.087
I got something.

00:34.272 --> 00:35.379
What the hell are they?

00:36.319 --> 00:37.388
Fall back!

00:38.833 --> 00:40.447
We will not go out like this.

00:48.381 --> 00:51.887
How will you lead Commander Locke, and for what?
