We have a lot of lane closures and roadwork for this weekend,...

00:04.265 --> 00:05.407
...so let's get right to it.

00:05.507 --> 00:08.914
Now, first off, the Causeway's been causing quite a headache for drivers...

00:09.169 --> 00:10.807
...with that new elevated lane shift.

00:10.924 --> 00:14.904
Now, the good news is those two southbound exit lanes are open.

00:15.191 --> 00:19.751
And also, 6th street is open to make that right turn to southbound Causeway,...

00:19.813 --> 00:22.499
...so good news for those of you who usually take the Causeway.

00:22.792 --> 00:24.142
You still might hit some slowdowns...

00:24.232 --> 00:26.341
...so you might want to tack on maybe 10 extra minutes...

00:26.626 --> 00:28.347
...as you make your way across the Causeway.

00:28.653 --> 00:31.832
Also, a full closure of the Huey P. Long bridge this weekend,...

00:31.925 --> 00:34.654
...both Saturday and Sunday in both directions.

00:34.993 --> 00:39.101
Now, it will close Saturday night at 9 pm until noon at Sunday.

00:39.387 --> 00:42.321
If you're worried about delays, you can always take the Crescent City connection...

00:42.404 --> 00:44.908
...or I-310 as an alternate route.

00:45.207 --> 00:46.613
Also, we have a movie shoot.

00:46.687 --> 00:50.123
Now, this will happen on Sunday right there at US-90.

00:50.454 --> 00:54.098
It will be closed completely between Perdido St. and Poydras St.

00:54.173 --> 00:57.291
Now, if you usually travel that area and you're worried about delays,...

00:57.377 --> 01:01.320
...you can also take Tulane Avenue to Loyola as a detour.

01:01.642 --> 01:04.648
