00:00.645 --> 00:03.523
Pediatric surgeon Dr. James Stein is preparing to separate...

00:03.628 --> 00:07.542
...two of the world's rarest conjoined twins, Macy and Mackenzie Garrison.

00:07.845 --> 00:12.348
To be able to do this type of complex surgery is kind of a dream come true.

00:12.649 --> 00:14.853
But there were lots of things that could go wrong.

00:17.241 --> 00:21.415
Nine-month-old Macy on the left and Mackenzie on the right are a medical phenomenon.

00:22.136 --> 00:24.976
They're only the second known case in the world of conjoined twins...

00:25.073 --> 00:26.415
...born with a triplet sister.

00:27.416 --> 00:30.677
They were adopted by Darla and Jeff Garrison, as much longed for daughters,...

00:30.765 --> 00:32.093
...when they were just nine months old.

00:33.548 --> 00:34.748
Madeline came out last,...

00:35.286 --> 00:37.570
...five minutes after her conjoined twin sisters.

00:38.245 --> 00:42.222
To prepare for surgery, the medical team is stretching Macy and Mackenzie's skin.

00:43.114 --> 00:45.631
They'll use the extra tissue to help close their wounds.

00:46.714 --> 00:50.495
Although genetically identical, the twins separate personalities are already forming.

00:51.369 --> 00:53.973
Macy was maybe a little bit more timid.

00:54.139 --> 00:56.345
Mackenzie was a little bit more the hard charger.

00:56.646 --> 00:57.629
Macy would whimper.

00:57.705 --> 00:58.657
Mackenzie would scream.

00:59.073 --> 01:04.696
Macy and Mackenzie are also among the rarest types of conjoined twins: ischiopagus twins.

01:06.912 --> 01:10.568
They each have a full set of internal organs but share a single pelvis,...

01:11.346 --> 01:13.539
...and are conjoined up to the top of their rib cages.

01:14.310 --> 01:16.017
Oh, why are you making that funny face?

01:16.119 --> 01:16.891
What did I do wrong?

01:17.591 --> 01:20.167
This makes separation particularly dangerous.
