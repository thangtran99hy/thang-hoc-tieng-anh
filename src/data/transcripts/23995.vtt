00:00.057 --> 00:02.757
First question is, how old do I have to be to join Emirates?

00:02.857 --> 00:06.021
Minimum age for Emirates is 21 years of age.

00:07.133 --> 00:09.511
Do I need a diploma or a degree for Emirates?

00:09.693 --> 00:11.438
The answer to that is no.

00:11.795 --> 00:16.947
You need proof of finishing or completing secondary school.

00:16.994 --> 00:18.533
I think that's all that you need.

00:18.870 --> 00:22.553
When you're applying online, you tell them which city you would like to interview at.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.989
If you're in a situation where you just can't make it...

00:25.066 --> 00:27.955
...to the location that they set you on on that date,...

00:28.291 --> 00:30.672
..just write to them and they will offer you something else.

00:30.865 --> 00:34.494
You should treat your interview as any other job application...

00:34.577 --> 00:35.970
...because it's exactly the same.

00:36.095 --> 00:41.463
They are going to ask you about your previous working experience, what job role you had,...

00:41.645 --> 00:44.173
...what challenges you had in that job,...

00:44.297 --> 00:48.414
...and you won't get asked any of those questions until your final interview stage.

00:48.468 --> 00:51.808
If you're invited to a final interview, that's when they're gonna be asking these questions.

00:52.225 --> 00:54.487
Up until that stage, it's just group activity.

00:54.761 --> 00:57.742
What are the Emirates looking for in a cabin crew?

00:58.059 --> 00:59.814
Firstly, you should always be polite.

00:59.930 --> 01:03.892
Now, that should go without saying but you should always treat the recruiters...

01:04.004 --> 01:08.834
...and your possibly future colleagues with respect and be polite.

01:09.067 --> 01:11.119
The second thing I always say is to smile.

01:11.213 --> 01:12.766
You always need to smile.

01:13.077 --> 01:17.154
Always have inner confidence, so that on your open day,...

01:17.238 --> 01:20.650
...you can give everyone the impression that, "Yes, I am meant to be here..."

01:20.747 --> 01:21.940
"...and this job is meant for me."

01:22.073 --> 01:24.040
"I am meant for the job and I want this job."

01:24.235 --> 01:28.495
Politeness, always smile, quietly confident: that's the three things I'd say that...

01:28.631 --> 01:32.395
...they are looking for and that you should be on your open day.
