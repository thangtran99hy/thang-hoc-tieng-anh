00:00.440 --> 00:02.513
There was a lot of concern earlier this morning...

00:02.595 --> 00:05.962
...because this frightening standoff actually played out on live TV.

00:07.907 --> 00:12.398
Using LoJack, authorities manage to track the car to San Diego County.

00:12.747 --> 00:17.453
They chased it down, stopping at the ramp from Route 52 to Route 67.

00:18.084 --> 00:22.199
Just before 9 AM, two of the young boys got out of the Toyota Camry.

00:22.587 --> 00:27.706
One boy was first, got out, shut the door, and walked to the waiting officers.

00:28.205 --> 00:31.758
Shortly after, the second boy gets out quickly and runs.

00:32.061 --> 00:34.498
About an hour went by with no action...

00:34.589 --> 00:38.081
...but authorities say they were on the phone with Daniel Perez.

00:38.438 --> 00:43.089
And officers put themselves in strategic position with rifles at the ready.

00:43.629 --> 00:45.757
Finally, officers made their move.

00:46.002 --> 00:48.837
An armored vehicle pulls right up to the front of the car...

00:49.215 --> 00:51.181
...and then one pins it in from the back.

00:51.716 --> 00:54.045
Perez decided to make his own move.

00:54.351 --> 00:58.385
He got out of his car, on the phone, appearing to drag one of his sons with him.

00:58.738 --> 00:59.798
The other one followed.

01:00.068 --> 01:01.933
Quickly, the officers moved in.

01:02.289 --> 01:05.406
Perez even looks like he's trying to jump to his death.

01:05.775 --> 01:08.039
He's dragged down and put in handcuffs...

01:08.324 --> 01:12.644
...while more officers grabbed the boys and walked them to safety.

01:13.945 --> 01:17.940
So again, all of those boys, all four boys appeared to be physically okay.

01:18.014 --> 01:19.617
They're in protective custody right now.

01:19.936 --> 01:23.639
Perez, their father, was taken to the CHP office in El Cajon.
