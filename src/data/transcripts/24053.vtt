The 5th of May is traditionally known as Tango no Sekku.

00:08.233 --> 00:11.255
It's a day to pray for the healthy growth of boys.

00:14.073 --> 00:18.001
In households across Japan, parents display suits of armor...

00:18.566 --> 00:21.108
...and dolls modeled after legendary warriors,...

00:21.626 --> 00:23.738
...wishing that their sons will be strong.

00:26.209 --> 00:28.528
The celebration of Tango no Sekku is incomplete...

00:28.596 --> 00:32.101
...without carp-shaped streamers known as koinobori.

00:33.020 --> 00:34.848
Koinobori come in many sizes.

00:35.685 --> 00:38.445
There are small ones only a few dozen centimeters long,...

00:39.041 --> 00:41.704
...and also large ones over ten meters long.

00:44.733 --> 00:49.405
Tango no Sekku celebrated on May the 5th involves many traditions and customs.

00:50.372 --> 00:53.565
They reflect not just a wish for the healthy development of boys,...

00:53.955 --> 00:58.059
...but also Japanese people's attentiveness to seasonal changes.
