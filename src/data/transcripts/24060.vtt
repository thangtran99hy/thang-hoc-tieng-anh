00:02.143 --> 00:03.989
Gunfire ring out in London...

00:04.090 --> 00:09.900
...as royal fans celebrated the arrival of the newest heir, Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana.

00:10.197 --> 00:12.108
Fourth in line to the British throne,...

00:12.226 --> 00:17.410
...the newborn princess's name is seen as a tribute to Prince William's parents and grandmother.

00:17.532 --> 00:19.417
I'm surprised, I thought it would be Alice.

00:19.690 --> 00:23.452
And I didn't think they'd be allowed to use Diana but Charlotte sounds really nice.

00:23.627 --> 00:27.674
The last time there was a Princess Charlotte was in the early 1800s,...

00:27.988 --> 00:30.498
...and the name still remains popular with the public.

00:30.825 --> 00:34.132
The pint-sized princess made her public debut over the weekend,...

00:34.421 --> 00:36.818
...weighing in at eight pounds, three ounces.
