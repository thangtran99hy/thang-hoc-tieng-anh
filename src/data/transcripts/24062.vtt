Spending time at the airport can get expensive,...

00:03.069 --> 00:04.882
...but there are a few ways to save.

00:05.122 --> 00:06.979
Hey guys, I'm Krystin Goodwin with Buzz60,...

00:07.069 --> 00:09.931
...and here's how to spend 15 dollars or less at the airport.

00:10.117 --> 00:11.141
Don't check your bag.

00:11.385 --> 00:14.554
Even if I'm traveling for two weeks, I travel with a carry-on.

00:14.904 --> 00:18.184
I hate paying for bag fees and I've had the airline lose my bag.

00:18.454 --> 00:19.516
Avoid airport food.

00:19.709 --> 00:22.629
Not only is it pricey, but it's not that tasty or good for you.

00:22.818 --> 00:26.055
Bring a bag with a few snacks and plastic containers you can throw away.

00:26.315 --> 00:28.421
Most of the time, you can get these through security.

00:28.705 --> 00:31.631
You can't bring liquids, but you can bring an empty plastic bottle...

00:31.821 --> 00:35.445
...and fill up at a filtered water fountain instead of buying pricey drinks.

00:35.685 --> 00:38.311
Plus, once you get on the plane, drinks are pretty much unlimited.

00:38.509 --> 00:42.001
If you get stuck or have a long layover, head to a restaurant chain.

00:42.199 --> 00:45.818
A small meal will cost you around the same as that random kiosk sandwich,...

00:46.172 --> 00:47.554
...but it'll probably taste better.

00:47.771 --> 00:49.681
Bring your own travel medicines and gum.

00:49.913 --> 00:51.818
These are also costly at the airport.

00:52.025 --> 00:55.291
And bring headphones so you don't have to purchase the ones from the airline.

00:55.526 --> 00:56.723
So, make a plan to save.

00:56.983 --> 00:59.289
Traveling is wonderful, but so is saving money.

00:59.704 --> 01:01.603
Buzz60: Now you know, pass it on.
