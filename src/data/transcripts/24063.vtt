00:00.478 --> 00:01.563
The whip of the wind,...

00:02.105 --> 00:03.565
...the burn on my muscles,...

00:05.191 --> 00:10.121
...feet pedaling, heart pumping, wheels spinning, gasping for breath:...

00:13.779 --> 00:14.917
...this is being alive.

00:16.279 --> 00:17.059
This is freedom.

00:18.401 --> 00:20.180
In this moment, that's all that matters.

00:24.701 --> 00:27.826
My zone: it works for me.

00:29.282 --> 00:33.055
The focus and energy I feel on my morning ride stays with me all day.

00:34.696 --> 00:35.363
I'm the same person.

00:36.384 --> 00:37.441
I have the same job.

00:38.525 --> 00:39.455
I live in the same town.

00:41.064 --> 00:42.412
But everything feels new again.

00:43.964 --> 00:46.403
My eyes are open to what's in front of me.

00:54.564 --> 00:55.627
I needed the change.

00:56.562 --> 00:59.511
I don't wanna think about what life would be like if I hadn't found cycling.

01:00.799 --> 01:03.185
I'm just glad I did with enough time left to enjoy it.
