00:00.345 --> 00:02.007
So you have ten years experience?

00:02.075 --> 00:02.657
I do.

00:02.745 --> 00:03.721
But no PHD.

00:03.791 --> 00:06.218
I do have a master's in early childhood development.

00:06.423 --> 00:08.691
You don't mind if I just record this, do you?

00:08.816 --> 00:10.577
No, why would I?

00:13.505 --> 00:14.331
First kid?

00:14.482 --> 00:15.359
Here's all the numbers.

00:15.438 --> 00:16.141
Food is in the fridge.

00:16.351 --> 00:19.124
Oh, and Lucas likes to pawn jewelry so you might wanna lose the nose ring.

00:19.462 --> 00:20.116
Second kid.

00:20.306 --> 00:22.687
See you at elevenish.

00:22.756 --> 00:27.467
By their second kid, every mom is an expert and more likely to choose Luvs than first-time moms.

00:27.581 --> 00:29.095
Live, learn and get Luvs.
