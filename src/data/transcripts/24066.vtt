So, six months ago, I get an email from Stewart Butterfield...

00:04.613 --> 00:07.435
...who wants to talk about making a video for his new thing, Slack.

00:08.035 --> 00:10.615
It would change the way teams communicate.

00:10.766 --> 00:14.186
The truth is, I was spending all my time doing emails instead of making stuff...

00:14.361 --> 00:15.505
...and something had to change.

00:15.623 --> 00:17.600
So yeah, we tried Slack.

00:18.870 --> 00:21.576
Slack lets us do all our communication in one place.

00:21.679 --> 00:25.340
It's like combining multiple forms of messaging and file-sharing into one app.

00:25.748 --> 00:29.481
You make channels in Slack, which is perfect for discussing specific topics in groups.

00:29.610 --> 00:34.127
Slack integrates with Dropbox, which is amazing because we use Dropbox for everything.

00:34.500 --> 00:35.981
I like that Slack always keeps my place.

00:36.250 --> 00:39.022
I can switch from my laptop to my mobile and I never miss a thing.

00:39.137 --> 00:39.915
Is this your card?

00:40.690 --> 00:41.217
Yes. No.

00:41.295 --> 00:42.216
And Adam loves it.

00:42.387 --> 00:44.869
Slack really has changed the way his team communicates...

00:44.959 --> 00:48.323
...and all this open, efficient communication keeps his company happy,...

00:48.781 --> 00:50.047
...which makes Adam happy too.
