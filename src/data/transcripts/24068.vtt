Our founders never intended us to have a professional political class.

00:10.129 --> 00:13.436
They believed that citizens and leaders needed to step forward.

00:14.021 --> 00:19.376
We know the only way to reimagine our government is to reimagine who is leading it.

00:20.112 --> 00:23.191
I'm Carly Fiorina and I'm running for president.

00:23.773 --> 00:29.127
If you're tired of the sound bites, the vitriol, the pettiness, the egos, the corruption,...

00:29.752 --> 00:33.912
...if you believe that it's time to declare the end of identity politics,...

00:34.191 --> 00:38.294
...if you believe that it's time to declare the end of lowered expectations,...

00:38.772 --> 00:43.387
...if you believe that it's time for citizens to stand up to the political class...

00:43.482 --> 00:46.447
...and say: "Enough," then join us.

00:46.825 --> 00:49.331
It's time for us to empower our citizens,...

00:49.407 --> 00:51.461
...to give them a voice in our government,...

00:51.671 --> 00:56.912
...to come together to fix what has been broken about our politics and our government for too long,...

00:57.533 --> 01:00.068
...because we can do this together.
