Have you ever heard the phrase "bite off more than you can chew?"

00:06.178 --> 00:08.184
When you "bite off more than you can chew"...

00:08.843 --> 00:11.149
...that means that you try to do too much...

00:11.546 --> 00:13.770
...or you try to do something too difficult for you.

00:14.869 --> 00:20.531
For example, "I always bite off more than I can chew when I accept all those projects."

00:21.469 --> 00:26.299
In other words, I try to do something that is too much or too difficult for me.

00:27.595 --> 00:31.983
Let's check out the next few clips to learn and practice how to use this idiom.

00:35.067 --> 00:37.277
By purchasing that huge new house,...

00:37.721 --> 00:40.801
...John has bitten off way more than he can chew.

00:43.663 --> 00:46.538
You might say "don't bite off more than you can chew"...

00:47.154 --> 00:50.169
...because you might not be able to do either of your jobs properly.

00:52.891 --> 00:55.255
So don't take on any crazy projects that are...

00:55.692 --> 00:58.081
...don't bite off more than you can chew.
