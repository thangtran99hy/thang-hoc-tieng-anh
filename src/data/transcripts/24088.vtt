Salinization is reducing the world's irrigated lands by one to two percent annually,...

00:06.902 --> 00:11.244
...according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization.

00:11.627 --> 00:17.485
But that doesn't faze Dutch farmer Marc Van Rijsselberghe, who has used saline water...

00:17.565 --> 00:22.433
...to kill some plants in order to identify which ones are able to thrive.

00:22.565 --> 00:24.515
We put in a lot of plants in the fields,...

00:24.621 --> 00:31.811
...and then we put them in freshwater and in seawater and all the varieties between it.

00:32.187 --> 00:36.617
And then, we see which variety is surviving and which variety is dying.

00:36.775 --> 00:40.502
Working with scientists from the Free University of Amsterdam,...

00:40.797 --> 00:45.198
...Van Rijsselberghe and his team divided a farm into eight plots...

00:45.500 --> 00:48.330
...covered with a network of irrigation pipes.

00:48.891 --> 00:53.034
Separate pipes bring fresh and sea water to a distribution center...

00:53.281 --> 00:57.432
...where a computer-controlled system mixes irrigation water...

00:57.609 --> 01:00.317
...with eight different degrees of salinity.

01:00.571 --> 01:03.081
And then the computer says go,...

01:03.339 --> 01:06.883
...and then it goes to the fields and the dripping irrigation starts to work.

01:07.307 --> 01:08.684
And we're going to kill plants.

01:09.227 --> 01:09.775
That's it.

01:09.913 --> 01:14.808
Numerous sensors continuously control soil salinity and moisture.

01:15.081 --> 01:20.413
Van Rijsselberghe says they were able to harvest vegetables from most of the test plots.

01:20.784 --> 01:23.164
Although they were smaller than normal,...

01:23.371 --> 01:27.523
...he says they contain more sugar and salt, so they taste better.

01:27.683 --> 01:28.605
It's a miracle.

01:29.606 --> 01:30.697
It shouldn't be a carrot.

01:30.861 --> 01:37.161
It should be dying if we look at the data that are available in the world at the moment.

01:37.360 --> 01:41.235
The farm managed to grow carrots, cabbage, onions and beetroot,...

01:41.493 --> 01:45.710
...but potatoes proved to be the most tolerant to saline water.

01:46.139 --> 01:50.919
Van Rijsselberghe says four varieties of salt-tolerant potatoes...

01:51.105 --> 01:53.445
...were recently shipped to Pakistan...

01:53.693 --> 01:58.121
...where thousands of hectares of land damaged by salinization...

01:58.277 --> 02:01.897
...are being prepared for testing the Dutch potatoes.
