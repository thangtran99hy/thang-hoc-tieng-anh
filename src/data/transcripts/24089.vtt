Ralph Dineen was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes more than 30 years ago.

00:04.707 --> 00:08.451
He wears an insulin pump and tests his blood sugar five times a day.

00:08.575 --> 00:12.988
When I became diabetic, it was a very confusing moment in my life.

00:13.822 --> 00:18.607
I was about 30 years old and it came out of nowhere at me.

00:18.775 --> 00:24.231
Dineen participated in a study that lasted seven years starting in the mid-1980s.

00:24.631 --> 00:26.785
Half the participants, including Dineen,...

00:27.034 --> 00:30.692
...were instructed on how to maintain tight control of their blood sugar.

00:31.087 --> 00:33.729
The other half controlled their sugar more loosely.

00:33.992 --> 00:39.062
A new study looked at the data to determine whether this intensive blood sugar control...

00:39.479 --> 00:43.493
...would help reduce long-term complications of the disease like vision loss,...

00:43.932 --> 00:46.865
...kidney failure, nerve damage and heart disease.

00:47.297 --> 00:51.869
Dr. David Nathan at Massachusetts General Hospital led the study.

00:51.973 --> 00:57.214
Tighter blood sugar control reduced those complications by as much as 60 to 70 percent.

00:57.417 --> 01:04.129
The researchers continued to follow 99% of these participants after the study ended in 1993.

01:04.651 --> 01:08.903
They wanted to see whether maintaining tighter blood sugar control early on...

01:09.149 --> 01:11.340
...would result in a longer lifespan.

01:11.551 --> 01:15.427
And it turns out that, although the entire group is doing quite well,...

01:16.047 --> 01:19.175
...including those who were originally on conventional therapy,...

01:19.663 --> 01:24.808
...those with intensive therapy have a reduction in mortality by about 33%.

01:25.213 --> 01:29.302
There is no thickening of the lens, so there are no cataracts developing, which is great.

01:29.408 --> 01:33.718
People with type 1 diabetes are not only doing better if they have intensive therapy...

01:33.933 --> 01:38.688
...but that their lifespan is probably approximating that in the nondiabetic population.

01:38.869 --> 01:43.825
Researchers are now trying to identify genetic and environmental causes of the disease...

01:44.143 --> 01:47.108
...and to see if they can get cells to produce insulin.

01:47.602 --> 01:51.875
The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
