Have you ever heard the phrase "bear in mind?"

00:03.703 --> 00:05.219
No, it's not about the animal!

00:06.297 --> 00:08.551
"Bear in mind" means to remember something.

00:09.592 --> 00:14.621
For example, "They are twins so bear in mind that they have a lot in common."

00:15.675 --> 00:16.567
In other words,...

00:17.035 --> 00:20.339
...you must remember that they are twins so they share the same interests.

00:21.617 --> 00:25.505

"...and bear in mind that you have two small kids in the car so please be careful."

00:51.573 --> 00:55.705
Let us bear in mind that this task is not very easy.
