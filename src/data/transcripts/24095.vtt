This industrial section of West Oakland is dotted with tiny houses...

00:04.973 --> 00:07.270
...designed and built by a local artist.

00:07.487 --> 00:11.651
Greg Kloehn has built and given away at least 20 of these structures.

00:12.221 --> 00:13.007
I like to help them.

00:13.071 --> 00:15.106
Sure, sure. I mean, it's fun for me.

00:15.179 --> 00:20.627
I like to make things and to do something that makes a big impact on someone's life is good.

00:20.904 --> 00:24.738
Oscar Young got a home and relief from chilly nights on the street.

00:25.368 --> 00:27.513
It's better than living on the ground, to tell you the truth.

00:27.595 --> 00:30.973
Because if it wasn't for Greg, I would be still on the ground.

00:31.068 --> 00:35.288
Kloehn visits a friend called "Sweetpea" who also lives in one of the houses.

00:35.549 --> 00:38.655
Inside, she is safe and can protect her belongings.

00:38.849 --> 00:44.045
Kloehn scours the streets for construction materials, often dumped illegally at night.

00:44.281 --> 00:47.618
He brings them to his studio where he puts the homes together.

00:48.620 --> 00:51.527
I mean, I've been in the middle of the building process, run out of materials,...

00:52.134 --> 00:55.371
...gotten in my truck, drove around to look for something.

00:55.454 --> 00:56.244
That's my shopping.

00:57.917 --> 01:00.599
A discarded cabinet door makes a window cover.

01:00.872 --> 01:03.553
Shipping pallets become the walls of the structure.

01:04.827 --> 01:05.687
Here's a pallet.

01:05.963 --> 01:07.117
The top is a door.

01:07.383 --> 01:11.827
The artist has installed a small electrical unit powered by a solar cell.

01:11.980 --> 01:17.221
I put it on a light, an old lamp, so you could move it around.

01:17.904 --> 01:20.545
You can keep it optimum just to the sun.

01:20.917 --> 01:23.151
Empty coffee bags become shingles,...

01:23.244 --> 01:27.096
...and a washing machine door and refrigerator shelf become windows.

01:27.495 --> 01:30.526
Nails, screws and glue hold it all together.

01:31.065 --> 01:33.115
I kinda call them "the fruits of the urban jungle."

01:33.555 --> 01:34.475
Here's what's dropping.

01:34.563 --> 01:36.879
Here are these natural resources that we can use.

01:37.134 --> 01:39.665
Some on the streets once had houses of their own,...

01:39.815 --> 01:42.889
...but Sheila Williams has learned to live with less.

01:43.007 --> 01:46.058
I had it all just like you people do out there.

01:46.562 --> 01:48.049
But now, look at me now.

01:48.325 --> 01:52.087
I'm living in one of Greg's houses and I'm thankful to that man.

01:52.399 --> 01:57.634
The residents have collected discarded wood and other material for Kloehn's newest shelters.

01:59.381 --> 02:03.425
So yes, when I finish the homes off, sometimes they come with artwork, everything installed.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.110
The artist says this is not a social project,...

02:06.225 --> 02:09.787
...just someone using his skills to help his homeless neighbors.

02:09.935 --> 02:13.355
