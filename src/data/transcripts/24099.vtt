If you haven't seen him live and heard him live...

00:03.159 --> 00:06.326
...and you just hear that there's a young kid who can play jazz,...

00:06.468 --> 00:09.696
...there's no way to prepare you for what you're going to experience...

00:11.199 --> 00:13.017
...until you actually see it happen.

00:16.833 --> 00:18.946
He's listening to everything that's happening.

00:19.279 --> 00:20.322
He plays with dynamics.

00:21.286 --> 00:25.866
He comes in with fully formed arrangements of tunes that he's thought of.

00:26.235 --> 00:30.607
And he also comes in totally open to changing or forgetting those arrangements...

00:31.088 --> 00:32.195
...and coming up with new ones.

00:32.336 --> 00:36.034
Everything that Ulysses and I played, he was reacting to,...

00:37.291 --> 00:39.926
...which is what I get from the greatest musicians.

00:40.137 --> 00:41.647
It's so natural for him.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.134
He hears it the way we hear, like, English vocabulary...

00:46.421 --> 00:47.286
...where you like, learn a new word.

00:47.579 --> 00:48.032
He learns it.

00:48.305 --> 00:49.916
He doesn't only just learn material.

00:50.462 --> 00:54.077
Joey understands then how to use the material in a musical way.

00:54.665 --> 00:59.044
It's amazing when we play, like, I hear so many different influences.

00:59.185 --> 01:02.847
Maybe I'd love a mentor while I'm still learning every day.

01:03.580 --> 01:04.407
Well, that's music.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.658
You have to keep doing what you do.

01:08.780 --> 01:16.726
While playing, my brain transforms. My heart transforms. Technique or anything is from the heart,...

01:18.590 --> 01:20.619
...and that's jazz: it's from the groove.
