00:02.657 --> 00:04.165
Oh my god, Teddy, look at this!

00:04.257 --> 00:05.545
It says if we wanna have a baby,...

00:05.632 --> 00:08.247
...you're gonna have to prove you're a person in a court of law.

00:08.403 --> 00:09.304
This is a nightmare.

00:09.408 --> 00:09.988
We gotta fight this.

00:10.073 --> 00:12.579
We'll get a lawyer and we'll sue the government for your civil rights.

00:13.755 --> 00:14.705
I'm Samantha Jackson.

00:14.793 --> 00:15.477
You must be Ted.

00:15.907 --> 00:17.124
Yeah, Samantha Jackson.

00:17.341 --> 00:17.928
What's your middle name?

00:18.041 --> 00:18.459
Leslie.

00:18.549 --> 00:20.567
Oh my god, you're Sam L. Jackson!

00:20.681 --> 00:22.955
That's great, just like Sam L. Jackson!

00:23.774 --> 00:24.341
Who is that?

00:24.411 --> 00:25.759
You ever seen any movie ever?

00:25.920 --> 00:26.675
He's the black guy.

00:28.321 --> 00:30.447
You want to be human in the eyes of the law.

00:30.891 --> 00:34.659
The important thing about being human is making a contribution to society.
