ï»¿I'm gonna be cruising around Tokyo and I'm going to show you...

00:03.129 --> 00:07.612
...what I think are 25 of the top things to do when you're in Tokyo.

00:07.972 --> 00:09.207
So, keep watching this video.

00:09.596 --> 00:11.834
Let's explore Tokyo together right now.

00:26.427 --> 00:31.817
I am at the Ameya-Yokocho Market, just next to Ueno station and park.

00:32.393 --> 00:35.954
There is almost everything in this market you can imagine: from cosmetics,..

00:36.367 --> 00:44.223
...I've seen big piles of shoes, jackets, clothes, golf stores, like, army fatigues stores,...

00:44.880 --> 00:49.705
...and also it's very famous for buying snacks so, giant snack stores.

00:51.103 --> 00:54.997
You can pick yourself up some green tea kitkats.

00:56.023 --> 00:58.997
You can spend a few hours here wandering around and exploring, for sure.

01:03.755 --> 01:05.623
We just took a walk through the park...

01:06.074 --> 01:11.756
...and now we are about to enter the Meiji Shinto Shrine.

01:12.241 --> 01:16.114
So, this is one of the most famous places to visit when you're in Tokyo.

01:16.378 --> 01:19.955
Located in the center of Tokyo yet in the midst of a quiet forested area,...

01:20.199 --> 01:22.034
...Meiji Jingu is one of the landmarks...

01:22.093 --> 01:25.113
...and most important religious Shinto monuments in Tokyo.

01:25.636 --> 01:28.683
When I visited, I got lucky to see a wedding ceremony taking place.

01:32.429 --> 01:34.862
I am at the Sumo stadium.

01:34.993 --> 01:36.263
Pretty cool place to visit.

01:36.392 --> 01:41.096
I'm pretty bummed right now that I'm not here during a fight time.

01:41.255 --> 01:43.944
You can come here when it's not fight season.

01:44.291 --> 01:47.605
And, there's a little museum at the stadium.

01:48.033 --> 01:52.997
It's pretty small but there is a bunch of photographs of the different famous sumo wrestlers,...

01:53.353 --> 02:01.791
...as well as little 3D models of basically every kind of winning technique or position.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.273
After going to the museum,...

02:03.446 --> 02:07.629
...no visit to Tokyo's Sumo town would be complete without a proper sumo feast...

02:07.773 --> 02:09.430
...and a dish known as "chankonabe."

02:09.728 --> 02:12.171
This hearty stew tastes absolutely amazing...

02:12.407 --> 02:15.023
...and it will fill your belly with extreme satisfaction.
