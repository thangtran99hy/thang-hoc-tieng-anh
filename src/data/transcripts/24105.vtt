Start by grabbing a few single layer 2x4 Lego connectors...

00:04.197 --> 00:08.261
...and punch a small hole through the back side by any means necessary.

00:08.416 --> 00:13.405
Now, grab your keys and slide that small Lego over the key ring and nestle it into place.

00:13.556 --> 00:18.636
Now, get a large block connector and apply some strong double-sided adhesive to the back.

00:19.061 --> 00:24.045
Take the block and mount it firmly to a wall, making sure the adhesive has fully taken hold.

00:24.345 --> 00:27.083
Now, you've got yourself a simple Lego key rack.

00:27.353 --> 00:30.545
Plug them in every time you come home and never lose your keys again.
