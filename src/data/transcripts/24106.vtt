For this project, I will be using some vintage teacups, candle wicks,...

00:04.157 --> 00:07.793
...and to not waste any candles, I will be reusing some wax remnants...

00:07.921 --> 00:09.503
...that I have from previous candles.

00:09.841 --> 00:11.839
First step is to heat and melt the wax.

00:12.231 --> 00:16.448
Next, with a hot glue gun, glue the base of your wick to the bottom of your cup.

00:16.698 --> 00:20.607
To hold the wick up straight, I recommend for you to use a ruler or a stick...

00:20.699 --> 00:23.837
...to hold your wick up straight while pouring in the hot wax.

00:24.184 --> 00:26.648
If you will be pouring on more than one layer of wax,...

00:26.741 --> 00:29.533
...then I recommend for you to let your wax set for 30 minutes or so...

00:29.623 --> 00:34.051
...before pouring on the next layer of wax to give yourself more variety in scent.

00:34.375 --> 00:35.298
And there you have it.

00:35.389 --> 00:37.671
A short, simple, and sweet DIY.
