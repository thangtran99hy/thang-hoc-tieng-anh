Hello, I'm Berna Lidero with VOA 60 America.

00:06.450 --> 00:10.018
US Secretary of State John Kerry expressed confidence Monday...

00:10.097 --> 00:13.518
...that pro-government forces in Iraq would regain control...

00:13.626 --> 00:17.209
...of the provincial capital of Ramadi from Islamic State fighters.

00:17.735 --> 00:22.009
Speaking in South Korea a day after the militants claimed to have seized Ramadi,...

00:22.395 --> 00:24.955
...Kerry said it was a "target of opportunity"...

00:25.273 --> 00:29.731
...and that he was confident the situation there would be reversed in the days ahead.

00:30.501 --> 00:34.911
Amtrak trains began rolling early Monday on the busy Northeast Corridor...

00:34.985 --> 00:37.517
...that includes Boston, New York and Washington.

00:37.890 --> 00:42.389
It was the first time in almost a week that service had been fully operational...

00:42.737 --> 00:45.781
...since a deadly crash in Philadelphia that killed eight people...

00:45.851 --> 00:47.953
...and injured more than 200 others.

00:49.209 --> 00:54.865
Finally, police in Waco, Texas, said they were arresting 192 people Monday...

00:54.938 --> 00:58.334
...in connection with a shootout at a sports bar over the weekend...

00:58.441 --> 01:01.015
...that left nine dead and 18 injured.

01:01.368 --> 01:05.240
The deadly gun battle occurred Sunday when at least five rival gangs...

01:05.334 --> 01:08.957
...attacked each other outside the Twin Peaks Sports Bar and Grill.

01:09.839 --> 01:10.822
That's all for today.

01:10.921 --> 01:11.799
Thanks for watching.
