Hi! Everything okay?

00:02.093 --> 00:05.143
I wanted to tell you I was sorry for how I acted yesterday.

00:06.011 --> 00:07.290
No, Ray, really.

00:07.395 --> 00:08.260
No, Emma.

00:09.289 --> 00:11.515
Emma? Emma?

00:15.989 --> 00:17.463
Oh my God!

00:31.647 --> 00:34.584
This whole chunk of land will be decimated.

00:35.483 --> 00:37.823
Are you saying the whole San Andreas Fault might go off?

00:39.095 --> 00:40.456
Everybody down!

00:42.077 --> 00:43.733
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.
