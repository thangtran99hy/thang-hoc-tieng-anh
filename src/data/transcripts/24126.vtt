ï»¿Have you ever been waiting in line at the grocery store,...

00:09.592 --> 00:13.811
...innocently perusing the magazine rack, when a song pops into your head?

00:14.225 --> 00:18.451
Not the whole song, but a fragment of it that plays and replays...

00:18.683 --> 00:22.906
...until you find yourself unloading the vegetables in time to the beat.

00:23.773 --> 00:26.925
You've been struck by an earworm, and you're not alone.

00:27.542 --> 00:32.031
Over 90% of people are plagued by earworms at least once a week,...

00:32.432 --> 00:36.587
...and about a quarter of people experience them several times a day.

00:37.016 --> 00:40.949
They tend to burrow in during tasks that don't require much attention,...

00:41.446 --> 00:45.263
...say, when waiting on water to boil or a traffic light to change.

00:45.815 --> 00:48.809
This phenomenon is one of the mind's great mysteries.

00:48.985 --> 00:54.623
Scientists don't know exactly why it's so easy for tunes to get stuck in our heads.
