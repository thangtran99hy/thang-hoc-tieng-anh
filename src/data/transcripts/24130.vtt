00:00.049 --> 00:02.282
The road ahead is not going to be easy.

00:03.532 --> 00:06.681
It never is, especially for folks like you and me.

00:07.348 --> 00:12.047
We've both felt the sting of those daily slights throughout our entire lives.

00:12.597 --> 00:15.481
The folks who crossed the street in fear of their safety.

00:15.765 --> 00:19.559
The clerks who kept a close eye on us in all those department stores.

00:19.899 --> 00:22.913
The people at formal events who assumed we were the help.

00:23.880 --> 00:28.315
And those who have questioned our intelligence, our honesty,...

00:28.508 --> 00:30.652
...even our love of this country.

00:31.807 --> 00:35.526
And I know that these little indignities are obviously nothing...

00:35.605 --> 00:39.601
...compared to what folks across the country are dealing with every single day.

00:40.329 --> 00:42.629
Those nagging worries that you're gonna get stopped...

00:42.734 --> 00:45.340
...or pulled over for absolutely no reason.

00:45.917 --> 00:50.629
The fear that your job application will be overlooked because of the way your name sounds.

00:51.272 --> 00:56.327
The agony of sending your kids to schools that may no longer be separate,...

00:56.896 --> 00:58.078
...but are far from equal.

00:59.103 --> 01:03.612
The realization that no matter how far you rise in life,...

01:04.041 --> 01:08.779
...how hard you work to be a good person, a good parent, a good citizen,...

01:09.065 --> 01:12.319
...for some folks, it will never be enough.

01:12.809 --> 01:21.285
But graduates, today I wanna be very clear that those feelings are not an excuse...

01:21.503 --> 01:23.802
...to just throw up our hands and give up.

01:23.930 --> 01:24.941
Not an excuse.

01:25.245 --> 01:28.292
They are not an excuse to lose hope.
