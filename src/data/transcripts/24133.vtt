Here's that report you needed.

00:05.061 --> 00:06.320
I don't see anything.

00:07.354 --> 00:10.028
Oh, dang it, I forgot to attach it.

00:11.102 --> 00:12.926
Hey Beth, did you see all the submissions we got today?

00:13.041 --> 00:14.395
OMG, I know!

00:14.492 --> 00:15.921
Easy on the all caps.

00:16.157 --> 00:16.781
Sorry.

00:16.950 --> 00:19.460
It's okay, semicolon, closed parentheses.

00:21.597 --> 00:24.092
Hi Tripp, are you satisfied with...

00:27.125 --> 00:28.212
Inbox full.

00:32.127 --> 00:33.011
That's what he said.

00:34.489 --> 00:36.545
Hey, what's this poker game I hear about this weekend?

00:36.811 --> 00:37.659
Who's that guy?

00:37.847 --> 00:39.633
You need me to bring anything or...

00:40.618 --> 00:42.458
I meant to invite a different David.

00:43.622 --> 00:44.293
Rain check?
