Everyone loves a good combination.

00:05.375 --> 00:07.409
New York City is home to one breakfast treat...

00:07.483 --> 00:10.960
...that combines two popular goodies in one tasty menu item.

00:11.615 --> 00:14.783
Called the cronut, it is essentially a croissant and donut.

00:15.020 --> 00:19.237
The owner of the Dominique Ansel Bakery is responsible for the cronut's debut.

00:19.819 --> 00:23.922
Shaped like a standard donut, it is comprised of several layers of croissant dough,...

00:24.073 --> 00:26.696
...which are deep-fried and stuffed with vanilla cream.

00:27.278 --> 00:31.609
The outer shell is warm and crunchy while the inside layers are soft and airy.

00:32.173 --> 00:33.667
To finish off the masterpiece,...

00:33.788 --> 00:37.919
...bakery workers roll the cronut in rose sugar and cover it in a glaze.
