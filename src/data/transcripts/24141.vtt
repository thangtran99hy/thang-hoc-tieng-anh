Hey everyone! I'm in Shibuya, Tokyo now. So, I'm going to do a brief tour of my hotel room.

00:09.383 --> 00:13.038
I need to put this card in here so that the light stays on.

00:13.124 --> 00:15.043
Otherwise, it's going to turn off on its own.

00:16.321 --> 00:19.644
So first I'll do a quick 360.

00:22.313 --> 00:24.112
And then there's a little bit more back there.

00:24.554 --> 00:30.694
So I'm going to go to the... This is just a small restroom.

00:31.901 --> 00:34.202
We have a sink here.

00:34.328 --> 00:34.810
Hi.

00:35.455 --> 00:39.951
And, as you may know, Japanese toilets are extremely high tech...

00:40.099 --> 00:43.787
...where you can get various flushing sound effects, make the seat warm,...

00:43.902 --> 00:45.475
...all that kind of interesting stuff.

00:46.025 --> 00:50.471
So, on the other side, there is the closet along with the fridge, tea sets, etc.

00:51.118 --> 00:56.287
And continuing on, here is, I guess, the living room kind of space.

00:56.374 --> 00:59.422
We have a very long couch right here.

01:01.325 --> 01:06.773
And then, the chair, comfy chair and a table with some paintings...

01:06.919 --> 01:08.215
...and I love those lights.

01:08.877 --> 01:09.934
Here's my luggage.

01:10.264 --> 01:15.857
And then here I have my desk, where I'm probably going to be doing some desk work or makeup.

01:16.615 --> 01:18.872
Here's the TV. I'm going to angle it towards...

01:19.229 --> 01:22.110
...my two beds that I have here.

01:22.693 --> 01:25.609
And then this is what the bathroom looks like.

01:25.869 --> 01:27.563
And then over here,...

01:28.160 --> 01:32.708
...since we didn't have a shower earlier or a bathtub in the restroom,...

01:32.797 --> 01:34.109
...it was actually over here.

01:34.926 --> 01:37.594
I love Japanese baths because they are very deep,...

01:37.723 --> 01:39.742
...even though this doesn't look as deep in this video,...

01:39.848 --> 01:43.882
...but it was really a nice way to relax and refresh myself for the next day.
