00:04.694 --> 00:07.336
I want to change how people think about ballet.

00:08.113 --> 00:12.509
One, two, three, once more, five, six, seven.

00:12.633 --> 00:15.929
People see ballet and they think of it as old-fashioned or feminine.

00:16.141 --> 00:17.195
Watch your arms, see?

00:19.177 --> 00:20.497
I'm almost six-foot-seven.

00:21.916 --> 00:25.373
I look like I'm supposed to play basketball, not dance ballet.

00:27.073 --> 00:28.196
I'm just doing what I love.

00:29.623 --> 00:34.037
The truth about ballet is that it's actually very athletic.

00:35.625 --> 00:37.689
It's graceful but not delicate.

00:38.799 --> 00:42.761
I want to show the world that dancers are some of the best athletes.

00:43.549 --> 00:45.027
That is my life's work.

00:47.784 --> 00:51.965
You can never be afraid to change the way things have been done.
