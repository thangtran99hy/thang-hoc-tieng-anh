The unidentified elderly man was seen walking his giant African spurred tortoise...

00:04.309 --> 00:07.474
...in various locations in Tokyo's Tsukishima region.

00:07.737 --> 00:10.257
While the animal is native to the Southern Sahara Desert,...

00:10.360 --> 00:12.321
...it seems pretty content in Japan,...

00:12.623 --> 00:14.695
...often donning adorable outfits.

00:14.988 --> 00:16.919
And they're not just taking a stroll around the block.

00:17.039 --> 00:22.161
Residents reported seeing them in Ginza as well, 1.2 miles away from Tsukishima.

00:22.587 --> 00:25.598
Needless to say, these two are gaining quite a bit of attention.
