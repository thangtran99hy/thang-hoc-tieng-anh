A lot of people who might like to take a trip are intimidated by the idea,...

00:04.289 --> 00:07.385
...either afraid of being lonely or afraid for their safety.

00:08.387 --> 00:13.113
But every day around the world, travelers just like you are exploring places by themselves.

00:13.991 --> 00:15.134
These are some trips you can take:...

00:15.819 --> 00:17.702
You can take a train someplace new.

00:18.576 --> 00:21.582
The train journey itself can make for a thoughtful solo trip.

00:22.243 --> 00:24.038
It's comfortable, reflective...

00:24.267 --> 00:27.312
...and even if you don't speak to anyone, you have the view to keep you company.

00:27.859 --> 00:31.325
Go to a part of Asia where you don't speak the language or understand the culture.

00:32.273 --> 00:34.553
It's like giving yourself voluntary culture shock or...

00:35.807 --> 00:37.226
...visiting an alternate reality.

00:38.115 --> 00:40.697
Traveling alone is about breaking out of your comfort zone,...

00:41.009 --> 00:45.701
...and what better place to do that than a country that is completely foreign.

00:46.100 --> 00:47.887
Go volunteer someplace for a month.
