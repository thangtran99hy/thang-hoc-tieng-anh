When antibiotics were first introduced in 1944, they were considered a miracle cure.

00:14.479 --> 00:17.303
They were used to treat a wide variety of diseases,...

00:18.539 --> 00:25.117
...like tuberculosis, salmonella, and pneumonia.

00:27.793 --> 00:32.067
Antibiotics were intended to be used sparingly to preserve their effectiveness.

00:33.926 --> 00:38.598
Today, most of our antibiotics are fed to factory farm animals.

00:40.903 --> 00:43.527
Antibiotics make the animals grow faster...

00:46.096 --> 00:49.061
...and enable them to survive unhealthy conditions.

00:52.388 --> 00:56.093
This system is creating antibiotic-resistant superbugs,...

00:57.317 --> 01:00.738
...making us all vulnerable to diseases they once cured.

01:03.981 --> 01:10.530
These superbugs are contaminating our soil, our water, and the very food we eat.

01:12.372 --> 01:14.114
It doesn't have to be this way.

01:15.735 --> 01:19.155
You have a choice, and together, we can change the system.

01:21.416 --> 01:25.689
Support Meat Without Drugs and stop the superbugs.
