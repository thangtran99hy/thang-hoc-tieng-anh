Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen!

00:04.501 --> 00:08.664
My name is Ryan Wang, and I'm a representative from the Metropolitan Transit Authority.

00:08.790 --> 00:14.353
And it is my honor to announce that this subway car has been recognized officially...

00:14.461 --> 00:20.090
...as the most courteous subway car in the entire New York City subway system.

00:20.284 --> 00:21.232
We want to thank you.

00:21.337 --> 00:23.131
We are providing you a pizza party,...

00:23.297 --> 00:26.569
...so please give yourselves a round of applause for your outstanding behavior.

00:27.852 --> 00:30.412
You have worked hard to reduce the amount of trash,...

00:30.567 --> 00:35.694
...and this train has the lowest percentage of manspreading of any car...

00:35.833 --> 00:38.053
...throughout the entire subway system.

00:38.487 --> 00:42.347
Congratulations and please enjoy your pizza party.
