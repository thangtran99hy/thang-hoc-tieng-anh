Hi, I'm Maddy.

00:01.564 --> 00:07.032
Have you ever considered what would happen if the Earth stopped spinning?

00:07.357 --> 00:10.862
Just how important is the planet's rotation to our lives?

00:11.039 --> 00:16.747
The Earth rotates at 1670 km/h.

00:17.082 --> 00:21.505
If we stopped suddenly, the effects would be catastrophic.

00:21.877 --> 00:26.720
We, and everything not deeply rooted to the planet, would be thrown sideways.

00:26.926 --> 00:29.663
The oceans, too, will maintain momentum,...

00:29.871 --> 00:36.417
...and within just one minute, will spread nearly 28 kilometers inland in a giant tsunami.

00:36.515 --> 00:39.691
And, with nothing to stop them, the winds would sweep around the earth,...

00:39.771 --> 00:41.797
...whipping it up into a giant storm.

00:42.331 --> 00:46.036
In short, our planet would not fare well.
