These women jostling to get registered have been waiting since the early hours of the morning.

00:06.471 --> 00:09.607
This seven-meter-long trailer is a portable clinic.

00:09.923 --> 00:14.255
And for the women, it means they can get free tests and check up on their health.

00:14.534 --> 00:18.972
In this mother and baby unit, women can learn their pregnancy status...

00:19.057 --> 00:23.785
...and have an ultrasound, as well as getting tests for blood pressure and diabetes.

00:23.953 --> 00:28.824
Nchaupe Mathosa is a member of a partner NGO and is volunteering today.

00:28.933 --> 00:34.650
Most people travel miles towards the clinic or looking for assistance,...

00:34.728 --> 00:40.850
...so, basically, once you bring a unit like this towards the rural people...

00:41.057 --> 00:46.895
...or the people who are in need, it would be very, very, very important to have it close by.

00:47.061 --> 00:50.652
The mobile clinic is an initiative by Samsung Electronics.

00:50.827 --> 00:54.176
The company has funded four solar-powered mobile clinics,...

00:54.409 --> 01:00.133
...each of them specialized for health needs such as eye care, dental care or malaria testing.

01:00.298 --> 01:06.855
The solar panels, combined with battery, allow the trucks, in theory, to operate 24 hours a day.

01:07.097 --> 01:11.428
Kea Modimoeng is Samsung Africa's corporate citizenship manager.

01:11.640 --> 01:16.170
In some instances, you have a clinic which is well-run by an NGO,...

01:16.513 --> 01:19.512
...but they lack these kinds of specialized services.

01:19.742 --> 01:23.633
We then bring in the truck to give it as an add-on service,...

01:23.779 --> 01:27.018
...which is very integral to the health-care provision.

01:27.421 --> 01:31.055
The company partners with various aid groups, universities...

01:31.131 --> 01:34.267
...and local governments to know where to position its trucks.

01:34.510 --> 01:39.061
But the project is still in its infancy and sometimes, misunderstandings happen.

01:39.183 --> 01:44.595
Like today, when neither Samsung nor the partner NGO brought medical gloves or stethoscopes.

01:46.217 --> 01:47.479
The unit is quite good.

01:47.923 --> 01:48.846
It's got a lot of things.

01:48.930 --> 01:54.086
It's got sonar, but some of the basic things like gloves...

01:54.514 --> 02:00.155
...and working material was not actually readily available.

02:00.921 --> 02:03.629
For Annah Mushwena, it was worth waiting.

02:03.867 --> 02:07.571
She initially went to the clinic to find out her pregnancy status,...

02:07.797 --> 02:12.383
...but she also got tested for diabetes, which she knew little about before.

02:12.530 --> 02:13.871
I just heard about it.

02:13.960 --> 02:17.805
But to be honest, the details, how does it work, how to prevent it,...

02:17.894 --> 02:19.807
...I was not even sure about it.

02:19.916 --> 02:23.175
But as from today, I can even explain to you how it works.

02:24.409 --> 02:27.560
The project will go full-scale at the beginning of next year,...

02:27.649 --> 02:32.407
...with two trucks touring South Africa and other visiting countries across Africa.

02:32.565 --> 02:38.375
Samsung hopes to reach one million people in the rural part of Africa by 2015.

02:38.782 --> 02:41.691
