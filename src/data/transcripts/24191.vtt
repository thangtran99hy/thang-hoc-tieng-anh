It's easy to see that neutral repulsion between the same poles of two magnets...

00:05.801 --> 00:08.212
...can counteract the force of gravity...

00:08.423 --> 00:13.351
...and make an object levitate or hover in space like this magnetic toy.

00:13.981 --> 00:19.613
Since the 1980s, that principle has been employed in so-called maglev trains...

00:19.872 --> 00:23.861
...in Europe, Japan and China that hover above the track.

00:24.238 --> 00:28.910
With no contact between the carriage and the surface and hence no friction,...

00:29.048 --> 00:33.435
...maglev trains are almost noiseless and can move very fast.

00:34.057 --> 00:39.531
Architect Greg Henderson, who founded the company "Arx Pax" with his wife Jill,...

00:39.825 --> 00:44.043
...says the same technology can make anything hover, even buildings.

00:44.253 --> 00:49.324
Imagine that there's an earthquake and the early warning system turns on the hover systems...

00:49.900 --> 00:53.093
...and the supports fall away as the building starts to hover.

00:53.346 --> 00:55.943
The shaking stops, the supports return,...

00:56.051 --> 00:59.206
...and no one in that room or that building ever knew there was an earthquake.

00:59.591 --> 01:00.945
As a proof of the concept,...

01:01.165 --> 01:06.179
...Henderson's company created the first maglev hoverboard called "Hendo,"...

01:06.463 --> 01:12.715
...capable of holding a single person about 2.5 centimeters above a metal surface.

01:12.863 --> 01:15.145
We are creating a magnetic field.

01:15.883 --> 01:19.531
And then through a method of induction, that's part of our secret sauce,...

01:19.817 --> 01:26.338
...we're creating a secondary and equal magnetic field in this conductive surface.

01:26.784 --> 01:31.877
For now, batteries that power Hendo's four engines last only for a short time.

01:32.108 --> 01:37.438
But design engineer Kyle O'Neil says for experienced skateboarders,...

01:37.604 --> 01:40.913
...it is enough to learn how to control the hoverboard.

01:41.248 --> 01:42.766
Some people say it's like snowboarding.

01:43.127 --> 01:46.850
Some people say, "This is how I imagine a hoverboard is supposed to be,"...

01:46.924 --> 01:50.783
...which is kind of an interesting response 'cause no one's ever ridden one before.

01:51.011 --> 01:57.021
Hendo's creators say they do not expect to see their hoverboard on the streets anytime soon...

01:57.267 --> 01:59.967
...because it only works on a metal-covered surface.

02:00.363 --> 02:05.517
But they say larger hover engines could be used for transporting containers,...

02:05.629 --> 02:07.691
...for instance, within a warehouse.

02:08.321 --> 02:11.777
For now, their dream is to build a skateboard park...

02:12.023 --> 02:17.661
...where anyone can take a spin on a hoverboard straight out of science fiction.
