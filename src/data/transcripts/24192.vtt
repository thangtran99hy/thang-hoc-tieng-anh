The Huffer Family Farm is a busy place each October,...

00:04.271 --> 00:10.007
...as families wander through the six-hectare Jumbo's Pumpkin Patch, searching for the perfect pumpkin.

00:10.387 --> 00:12.292
It's a good one, I think it's looking good.

00:12.525 --> 00:17.651
Sarah Cosgrove has been coming to Jumbo's for several years with her husband and two sons.

00:18.065 --> 00:22.683
The landscape is really pretty and we usually are able to get our pumpkins right off the vine.

00:22.751 --> 00:26.667
We'll carve them up and stick them on our front porch to decorate our house.

00:26.752 --> 00:29.630
The Huffer family has farmed these 53 hectares...

00:29.698 --> 00:33.801
...near Maryland's Catoctin Mountains for more than 140 years.

00:34.259 --> 00:38.049
David Huffer and his brother are the seventh generation to run the farm...

00:38.326 --> 00:39.869
...with help from their families.

00:40.363 --> 00:43.243
The pumpkin patch was opened in 1994,...

00:43.386 --> 00:48.456
...and Huffer says it's a chance to see pumpkins on the vine instead of in a grocery store.

00:48.626 --> 00:51.563
A lot of kids don't realize how pumpkins grow.

00:51.849 --> 00:53.933
They're having fun and learning something at the same time.

00:54.041 --> 00:57.945
Other fun activities include taking pony rides and eating ice cream.

00:58.427 --> 01:00.153
Rodney Kline, a friend of Huffer's,...

01:00.392 --> 01:06.025
...churns the homemade treat in an ice cream maker connected to an old gas engine from 1918.

01:06.126 --> 01:12.561
Back in the day, the farmer would have used it to run a small corn grinder or corn sheller,...

01:13.073 --> 01:14.233
...maybe the well pump.

01:14.422 --> 01:18.584
Huffer says families also enjoy the hayride that brings them to the pumpkin patch.

01:18.721 --> 01:21.673
We have people who just like to ride the wagons because that's all they want to do.

01:21.763 --> 01:25.901
They just like to ride around and they'll do that all afternoon, which is fine,...

01:26.011 --> 01:28.205
...and they have a good time doing it.

01:32.191 --> 01:36.294
Diane Wilkerson is amused watching her grandchildren search for pumpkins.

01:36.537 --> 01:38.119
Especially when they try to pick them up,...

01:38.194 --> 01:41.187
...and then they go to the ground when they find out that they're too heavy.

01:42.047 --> 01:45.844
These kids already know what they're going to do with their pumpkins for Halloween.

01:46.129 --> 01:47.463
Paint a face on it.

01:47.562 --> 01:48.701
A scary face!

01:48.813 --> 01:52.537
Cameron Spinner was very excited about his first visit to Jumbo's.

01:55.432 --> 01:59.151
His mother, Cynthia, says the pumpkin patch is a lot of fun for her, too.

01:59.251 --> 02:02.077
I had a great time just finding the biggest pumpkins.

02:02.193 --> 02:03.799
There's huge pumpkins here.

02:04.045 --> 02:08.008
Six-month-old Aidan Cain was dressed for his first visit to a pumpkin patch.

02:08.191 --> 02:10.065
Say hi, smile!

02:10.182 --> 02:14.198
But his parents, Brian and Tammy Cain, look like they're having more fun.

02:14.283 --> 02:17.169
We decided to come out, have a good time, take him on a hayride.

02:17.419 --> 02:22.479
We had to celebrate with our son and do all the things that we love to as a kid and just enjoy it.

02:22.677 --> 02:27.690
The pumpkins are taken to their new homes to be painted, or carved, or just left plain.

02:28.137 --> 02:31.956
A familiar and festive decoration for the Halloween celebration.

02:32.165 --> 02:34.931
