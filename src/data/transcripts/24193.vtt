00:02.615 --> 00:05.979
Retired lawyer Maurice Mountain is using a CNC router...

00:06.185 --> 00:09.407
...to produce a prototype of his Presto Emergency Boat Ladder.

00:10.038 --> 00:12.262
He's planning to mass-produce his invention:...

00:12.541 --> 00:15.450
...a small folding ladder that can be clipped on the side of a boat...

00:15.561 --> 00:17.559
...to assist people who fall into the water.

00:18.264 --> 00:21.391
I think it encourages innovation.

00:21.485 --> 00:23.399
I think people who probably have had...

00:23.750 --> 00:26.954
...ideas rolling around in the back of their mind for years,...

00:27.291 --> 00:31.029
...but never have had the opportunity to actually put them into production...

00:31.823 --> 00:35.449
...or even experiment with them would find this place wonderful.

00:35.749 --> 00:38.259
The place that Mountain is referring to is TechShop,...

00:38.629 --> 00:41.821
...a studio that makes high-tech equipment available to its members.

00:42.149 --> 00:46.315
TechShop is a do-it-yourself maker space and fabrication studio.

00:46.476 --> 00:50.576
As you can see, when you come in, we have all these different areas of the shop,...

00:50.737 --> 00:56.883
...and we have a metal shop, wood shop, plastic slab, lasers, 3D printers, electronics, textiles.

00:56.963 --> 01:00.876
We have so many different areas and we have all this equipment...

01:00.991 --> 01:05.373
...that is available to anybody above the age of 12 and up.

01:05.613 --> 01:09.971
At TechShop, with membership fees starting at just over $100 per month,...

01:10.617 --> 01:13.250
...members have access to million-dollar equipment,..

01:14.280 --> 01:19.748
...3D modeling, laser cutters and water jets, all at their fingertips.

01:20.749 --> 01:25.147
Our motto is "Build your dreams here" because you can really come in with just an idea,...

01:25.427 --> 01:29.191
...and then, with the help of TechShop, make that leap from an idea...

01:29.259 --> 01:33.328
...to building your project or your prototype or even your business.

01:33.837 --> 01:38.481
One example is Square, which came out of the TechShop facility in San Francisco.

01:39.281 --> 01:44.749
Now, Square is used to charge about 8.8 billion dollars in transactions every year.

01:45.838 --> 01:50.709
The consumers of products that were created at TechShop even include President Obama,...

01:51.125 --> 01:53.837
...who thinks innovation is the first step to the future...

01:54.136 --> 01:59.718
...and that TechShop is giving ordinary people the tools they need to turn their ideas into reality.

01:59.922 --> 02:06.443
Because of advances in technology, part of the opportunity is now to make the tools...

02:07.763 --> 02:14.653
...that are needed for production, and prototypes are now democratized.

02:14.849 --> 02:16.961
They're in the hands of anybody who's got a good idea.

02:17.213 --> 02:19.097
Jim Newton is the founder of TechShop.

02:19.513 --> 02:24.263
He first introduced the idea at Maker Faire in San Mateo, California, in 2006.

02:25.245 --> 02:28.096
This idea attracted hundreds of members the first day.

02:28.815 --> 02:32.919
Now, there are eight US TechShop facilities with more than 6,000 members.

02:33.712 --> 02:39.349
In addition to TechShop, Fab Lab and GE Garages are also helping inventors and entrepreneurs...

02:39.464 --> 02:42.088
...to discover the latest manufacturing processes.

02:42.753 --> 02:45.870
