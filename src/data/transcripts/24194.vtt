00:10.165 --> 00:12.474
E-book readers are thin, like a magazine,...

00:12.708 --> 00:16.391
...and can store hundreds of titles on a device smaller than most paper books.

00:16.991 --> 00:21.768
They are also portable and allow readers to download books using a wireless Internet connection.

00:22.317 --> 00:25.481
Some devices even have a feature that reads the story out loud.

00:26.147 --> 00:28.997
Sales of both e-books and digital readers are rising,...

00:29.171 --> 00:31.681
...as American consumers continue to demand products...

00:31.753 --> 00:34.775
...that fit their increasingly mobile computerized society.

00:35.051 --> 00:37.219
I definitely would find it more convenient for myself...

00:37.357 --> 00:39.791
...if I had a whole bunch of books just on this little computer.

00:40.197 --> 00:44.981
Online retailer Amazon.com says it stocks more than 300,000 e-book titles.

00:45.347 --> 00:49.543
It charges about $10 each for bestsellers and new releases in e-book form.

00:50.134 --> 00:52.444
Hardback versions often cost much more.

00:53.207 --> 00:55.908
Some authors and publishers have moved to digital releases...

00:55.993 --> 01:00.523
...to save on the cost of producing a book such as printing, delivery and storage.

01:01.094 --> 01:05.024
These costs account for more than 12% of the retail price of a traditional book.

01:05.688 --> 01:09.251
Mystery novelist Debbi Mack's books are sold in electronic form.

01:09.617 --> 01:12.696
She says digital publishing is a valuable tool for authors.

01:12.968 --> 01:16.004
I think that it provides a lot of opportunities...

01:16.079 --> 01:21.263
...for people to get old, out of print work back out on the market.

01:21.587 --> 01:25.498
If you can't find a publisher, and you know you have a quality product,...

01:25.582 --> 01:27.422
...it gives you a means of doing that.

01:27.600 --> 01:31.205
But critics say e-books are not as engaging as traditional paper books.

01:31.659 --> 01:34.936
Author Eugenia Kim's new novel is available in both formats,...

01:35.402 --> 01:38.027
...but she says she prefers the feel of a traditional book.

01:38.293 --> 01:45.251
There is something wonderful about the tactile act of turning a page,...

01:45.333 --> 01:51.951
...and having that whole business of having a story reveal itself as you turn a page.

01:52.024 --> 01:55.543
I think it comes from a childhood experience with books.

01:55.996 --> 01:57.981
Others shun electronic book publishing.

01:58.461 --> 02:02.907
Richard Peabody publishes poetry and short stories in traditional form only.

02:03.102 --> 02:06.080
I really think that some people just don't want to read on the screen.

02:06.159 --> 02:10.348
If you work all day and you read screens all day long, it's like the last thing you want to do.

02:10.609 --> 02:13.575
Meanwhile, technology corporations are already battling over...

02:13.661 --> 02:15.801
...who should own the digital rights to many books.

02:16.480 --> 02:19.456
Amazon, Microsoft and Yahoo! oppose a legal settlement,...

02:19.557 --> 02:22.807
...giving rival Google the rights to millions of copyrighted titles.

02:23.402 --> 02:26.738
The companies say the settlement could hurt competition in the e-book market...

02:26.960 --> 02:29.660
...as more consumers choose to use electronic readers.
