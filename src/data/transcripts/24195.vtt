You know, it took radio 38 years to accumulate 50 million users.

00:16.593 --> 00:18.565
It took television 13 years.

00:18.804 --> 00:20.825
It took the Internet four years.

00:21.153 --> 00:26.413
But it took Facebook just one year to accumulate 200 million users.

00:26.824 --> 00:30.192
The media environment, to say the least, is totally changing.

00:30.665 --> 00:33.741
Online social gaming like Farmville and Mafia Wars...

00:33.951 --> 00:37.425
...is the second most popular online activity in the United States.

00:37.613 --> 00:40.659
Ahead of email, social networking is number one.

00:40.926 --> 00:45.102
But if you're on a social network, chances are, you or one of your friends is playing games.

00:45.313 --> 00:50.460
On Facebook, 40% of its 500 million users today play online games.

00:51.031 --> 00:54.075
Hundreds of millions of dollars in virtual products for social gaming...

00:54.319 --> 00:56.981
...will be sold in the United States in 2010.

00:57.509 --> 01:00.544
Greg Kihlstrom runs a web design and development firm.

01:00.859 --> 01:04.843
There's games that you can download free for the iPad or iPhone or things like that.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.404
But once you download them, in order to really unlock the secrets of the game...

01:11.492 --> 01:14.381
...or get new levels or things like that, you have to purchase an upgrade.

01:14.577 --> 01:19.698
George Washington University's Dianne Martin says the online gaming business model is brilliant...

01:19.997 --> 01:23.865
...because the gaming company takes advantage of a market that is already there.

01:24.202 --> 01:29.113
Part of their rationale for being on social media is to have this big group of friends.

01:29.731 --> 01:33.433
So, you've got the friend basis and you simply use that as a platform...

01:33.539 --> 01:38.411
...to then do 'farming' or whatever all these games are that they do.

01:38.667 --> 01:41.079
Greg Kilstrom says aside from being fun,...

01:41.172 --> 01:45.899
...another part of the genius behind the game like Farmville, the number one Facebook game,...

01:46.150 --> 01:49.654
...is that people can spend a short amount of time doing simple tasks...

01:50.065 --> 01:51.990
...which keeps them interested and challenged.

01:52.271 --> 01:54.919
They'll come back, they might be at work, they might be at school,...

01:54.987 --> 01:56.548
...they might be doing all sorts of other things,...

01:56.631 --> 02:00.009
...and they'll come, they'll play for ten minutes, see the ads on the screen,...

02:00.145 --> 02:03.761
...come back a few minutes later and they'll see more ads.

02:03.856 --> 02:06.310
They might click on the ads, they might do other things,...

02:06.457 --> 02:11.592
...but really it's a symbiotic relationship between the people who make the games...

02:11.731 --> 02:13.478
...and the social networks that they're hosted on.

02:13.677 --> 02:17.389
With millions of people playing games online and repeatedly,...

02:17.645 --> 02:20.302
...profits for game developers can really stack up.

02:20.513 --> 02:27.990
It seems that the primary way of monetization is through virtual goods or virtual features.

02:28.233 --> 02:31.649
So, if I want to buy special tools, then I can,...

02:32.153 --> 02:37.359
...I pay money to get special little things to help me in the process of the game.

02:38.366 --> 02:41.338
George Assimakopoulos is the founder of EyeTraffic Media,...

02:41.540 --> 02:45.920
...which helps companies identify their audiences and drive traffic to their websites.

02:46.215 --> 02:50.803
The consumers themselves have realized that the Internet and the web is now the media channel...

02:50.909 --> 02:54.981
...where they have self-expression and the ability to share in communities...

02:55.233 --> 02:56.715
...who have similar interests to them.

02:57.020 --> 03:01.401
In the past, you might sit down face-to-face with friends or family to play board games.

03:01.685 --> 03:05.958
Online gaming allows you to interact with people who might be anywhere in the world.

03:06.419 --> 03:10.599
Assimakopoulos says that online social games can create a viral activity,...

03:10.748 --> 03:12.945
...a naturally expanding social community.

03:13.325 --> 03:16.329
When you have somebody coming to a friend and saying, "Hey, you gotta be involved,..."

03:16.799 --> 03:20.331
...it has much more credibility than any kind of outside advertising...

03:20.585 --> 03:23.591
...because I'll believe a friend before I would any other form of media.

03:23.929 --> 03:26.085
Social games are so popular in Asia,...

03:26.242 --> 03:30.620
...more than seven billion dollars in virtual items were sold there last year.

03:30.951 --> 03:33.025
I'm Philip Alexiou, VOA News.
