Dogs are not usually relaxed in a lab environment,...

00:04.342 --> 00:06.377
...but with a little petting and lots of treats,...

00:06.503 --> 00:09.821
...they can be trained to sit still even in an MRI scanner.

00:10.056 --> 00:13.334
That's how researchers at Hungary's ELTE University...

00:13.482 --> 00:15.753
...were able to get images of their brains at work.

00:16.070 --> 00:18.075
Research fellow Attila Andics says...

00:18.162 --> 00:21.281
...it helped them better understand the dog's relationship with humans.

00:21.443 --> 00:27.594
We have known for a long time that dogs and humans share similar social environment,...

00:27.715 --> 00:32.131
...but now our results show that dogs and humans...

00:32.229 --> 00:37.299
...also have similar brain mechanisms to process social information.

00:37.493 --> 00:41.334
After training 11 dogs to stay motionless while their brains were scanned,...

00:41.627 --> 00:46.779
...the researchers checked their neurological responses to about 200 emotionally relevant sounds,...

00:47.017 --> 00:49.811
...from whining and crying to playful barking and laughing.

00:50.072 --> 00:52.525
They then compared the responses from human subjects.

00:52.741 --> 00:54.195
They found striking similarities.

00:54.485 --> 00:57.451
Andics says it opens new possibilities for research.

00:57.703 --> 01:01.621
It establishes a foundation of a new branch of comparative neuroscience,...

01:01.805 --> 01:07.216
...because until now it was not possible to measure the brain activities of a non-primate...

01:07.581 --> 01:10.489
...and the primate brain in a single experiment.

01:10.693 --> 01:14.967
The canine mind is also being studied at Duke University in North Carolina.

01:15.359 --> 01:19.029
Co-director of the school's Canine Cognition Center, Evan MacLean,...

01:19.303 --> 01:22.239
...says that the Hungarian results are an important step forward.

01:22.405 --> 01:26.101
And what that tells ordinary dog owners, the Hungarian scientists say,...

01:26.472 --> 01:29.919
...is to treat your canine companions as friends, not mere animals,...

01:30.237 --> 01:32.782
...because they evidently understand human feelings.

01:33.189 --> 01:36.584
