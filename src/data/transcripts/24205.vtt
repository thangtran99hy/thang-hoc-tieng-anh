For most travelers, visiting Japan is like visiting another planet.

00:10.144 --> 00:14.987
Tokyo's futuristic skyscrapers extend to every point on the horizon.

00:15.181 --> 00:19.797
Its colossal billboards pulse and shimmer, lighting up whole city blocks.

00:20.309 --> 00:23.147
Fantastic too, are the sleek bullet trains...

00:23.227 --> 00:26.762
...that race across pastoral landscapes at frightening speeds.

00:27.053 --> 00:29.677
And Kyoto's demure kimono-clad women...

00:29.893 --> 00:32.325
...strolling through the pine-shaded courtyards...

00:32.416 --> 00:36.405
...of ancient zen temples appear like visions from a dream.

00:38.293 --> 00:46.927
In all of its everyday expressions, Japan is enchanting, bewildering, and intimidating.

00:48.539 --> 00:53.211
But if you're a food professional, or simply an enthusiast, you need to go there.

00:53.953 --> 00:57.203
So, join us as we explore Japan from north to south.

00:57.655 --> 01:00.279
We'll stop at Tokyo's enormous Tsukiji market,...

01:00.643 --> 01:03.330
...known for its astonishing selection of seafood,...

01:03.505 --> 01:07.060
...and we'll dine at some of Kyoto's famed kaiseki restaurants...

01:07.229 --> 01:09.949
...like Hyotei, a first-class establishment...

01:10.178 --> 01:13.371
...serving customers for more than 400 years.
