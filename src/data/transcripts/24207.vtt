Dad told me, "Never give up on the ones that you care about,..."

00:06.775 --> 00:09.175
"...and always remember the good things."

00:13.521 --> 00:18.716
"Keep looking and the good things will find their way back to you."

00:19.834 --> 00:20.723
So I did.

00:21.215 --> 00:22.336
I looked everywhere.

00:23.295 --> 00:26.701
And the more I looked, the more I thought about you.

00:27.737 --> 00:29.489
All the good times that we had.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.164
Home isn't a home without you.

00:41.842 --> 00:46.141
Dad told me, "Never give up on the ones that you care about."

00:46.653 --> 00:50.302
"Keep looking and the good things will find their way back to you."

00:52.546 --> 00:53.395
They did.

00:55.758 --> 00:56.666
They did.
