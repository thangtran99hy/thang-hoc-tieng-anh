The British tradition of acting is part of our culture.

00:06.384 --> 00:09.905
I feel part of a collective who care about their art.

00:11.009 --> 00:16.278
For me, in order to become a successful performer, it's taking hard work, perseverance,...

00:16.723 --> 00:18.701
...and most of all, passion.

00:18.955 --> 00:20.210
Because you want it to be perfect.

00:21.384 --> 00:24.249
British craftsmen are at the top of their game.

00:24.643 --> 00:30.107
You only have to look at a film like Harry Potter to see the development that they made...

00:30.484 --> 00:31.547
...on special effects.

00:31.801 --> 00:35.452
They were creating things that nobody had ever seen before.

00:36.074 --> 00:38.155
And I figure that's something as Brits,...

00:38.647 --> 00:41.798
...once we set our mind to something, I think we really, really do go for it.
