00:00.704 --> 00:03.385
Welcome aboard and thanks for flying with Delta.

00:03.938 --> 00:06.910
Our first priority on every flight is safety.

00:07.125 --> 00:10.887
So before we depart, I'll be giving a brief safety presentation.

00:11.020 --> 00:14.973
Be sure all carry-on items are securely stowed in an overhead bin.

00:15.200 --> 00:18.913
And ensure your mobile phones and electronic devices are turned off.

00:23.058 --> 00:25.063
If you're seated at an emergency exit,...

00:25.244 --> 00:29.359
...please review the responsibilities on the emergency exit seating, oh.

00:29.548 --> 00:33.736
Please keep your seat belt fastened in case we experience unexpected rough air.

00:38.471 --> 00:42.005
Smoking is not allowed on any Delta flight,...

00:42.224 --> 00:47.469
...and federal law prohibits tampering with, disabling, or destroying a restroom smoke detector.

00:48.083 --> 00:50.458
Please take a moment to find the exits closest to you.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.851
And remember, they might be behind you.

00:57.547 --> 01:01.407
Life vests are located under the seats, under your seat in the economy cabin.

01:01.766 --> 01:06.731
Be sure your seat is upright, your aisle armrests are lowered, and your tray table is, ugh.

01:08.506 --> 01:11.215
And all carry-on items are properly stowed.

01:11.637 --> 01:13.692
Please let us know if you have any questions.

01:14.057 --> 01:17.250
Sit back, relax and enjoy the flight.
