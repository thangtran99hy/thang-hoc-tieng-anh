00:01.867 --> 00:03.377
Yes, the middle seat's open.

00:04.778 --> 00:06.350
They look so nonjudgmental.

00:07.561 --> 00:08.428
I don't trust that.

00:10.409 --> 00:13.586
No shame in running half a half marathon.

00:15.315 --> 00:16.207
Two miles?

00:17.931 --> 00:18.600
Oh, good.

00:18.985 --> 00:20.831
A bunch of models right in front of me.

00:22.103 --> 00:24.437
Okay yoga, change my life.

00:25.223 --> 00:29.485
And focus on something else.

00:31.701 --> 00:33.587
Why are there so many mirrors?

00:34.442 --> 00:38.379
Don't mind me over here with my little baby weights, baby arms.

00:38.869 --> 00:39.895
What am I even doing?

00:40.263 --> 00:41.667
This is actually really motivating.

00:42.255 --> 00:43.132
I love running.

00:43.315 --> 00:43.993
It's really fun.

00:44.388 --> 00:46.603
Exercise reduces stress.

00:47.837 --> 00:48.687
Steady.

00:48.951 --> 00:49.611
I got this.

00:49.763 --> 00:50.853
Oh, I can't.

00:51.028 --> 00:51.775
Almost there.

00:52.045 --> 00:52.549
I can't.

00:52.655 --> 00:53.039
Breathe!

00:53.361 --> 00:53.834
I can't!

00:55.839 --> 00:56.736
I did it!

00:59.137 --> 01:00.065
Let's go again.
