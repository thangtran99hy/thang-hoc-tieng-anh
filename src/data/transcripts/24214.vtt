00:09.639 --> 00:11.173

00:11.493 --> 00:15.619
...the lime-colored amphibian has translucent skin on its underside...

00:15.997 --> 00:19.519
...and has an eye that makes it look like the famous Muppet Kermit.

00:20.085 --> 00:24.093
The frog's translucent belly makes its internal organs easy to see,...

00:24.551 --> 00:27.667
...but those big, white eyes with perfect black centers...

00:28.007 --> 00:30.455
...give it a distinctive Muppet-like look.
