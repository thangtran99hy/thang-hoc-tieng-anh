How do you describe your mother?

00:02.949 --> 00:03.907
You know, what's she like?

00:04.125 --> 00:08.023
My mother is like an example of how to live your life to the fullest.

00:08.597 --> 00:09.401
She's bright.

00:09.592 --> 00:11.522
And not just smart, I mean, she's bright.

00:11.671 --> 00:14.573
She's like sunshine, like all the time.

00:14.888 --> 00:16.757
How often do you tell her how you feel?

00:17.000 --> 00:20.083
I don't think I've actually said the words "I love you" to my mom in a long time.

00:22.351 --> 00:24.387
She knows I love her, that goes without question.

00:25.031 --> 00:31.765
I would like her to know that I feel it's my duty to make sure...

00:31.840 --> 00:35.765
...she sees everything she wants to see in this life.

00:37.826 --> 00:40.476
And enjoys herself as much as humanly possible.
