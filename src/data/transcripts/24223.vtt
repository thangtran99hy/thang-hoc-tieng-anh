Mabuhay! Thank you for choosing Philippine Airlines, Asia's first airline.

00:06.672 --> 00:10.775
Before settling down, please put your bags in the overhead compartment...

00:10.952 --> 00:12.580
...or under the seat in front of you.

00:12.997 --> 00:14.256
Don't stand on your seat.

00:14.481 --> 00:16.251
Seats are for sitting, remember?

00:17.210 --> 00:19.179
To put your bags in the overhead compartment,...

00:19.632 --> 00:21.772
...please use the step board beside your seat.

00:25.501 --> 00:28.526
It's okay, sit back and relax.

00:28.790 --> 00:30.786
We're just going to show you a few things...

00:30.861 --> 00:34.565
...that will make your flight a safe and comfortable travel experience.

00:34.909 --> 00:38.102
Now, take the time to check the safety card in front of you.

00:38.791 --> 00:39.531
Excellent!

00:39.902 --> 00:43.436
You'll notice that the card is full of interesting pictures and instructions.

00:43.642 --> 00:47.574
These are designed to help you better understand the aircraft safety features,...

00:47.888 --> 00:50.825
...so in case of an emergency, you'll know what to do.

00:51.709 --> 00:55.016
About your seatbelt, it may look simple.

00:55.325 --> 01:00.233
But in case we experience turbulence, this will keep you safe and free from harm.

01:00.861 --> 01:05.430
Simply insert the metal end into the buckle until you hear a click.

01:05.590 --> 01:07.657
And pull the loose end to tighten it.

01:07.855 --> 01:10.479
To open, lift top of the buckle.

01:10.799 --> 01:16.552
It is Philippine Airlines' policy that you should always fasten your seatbelt whenever seated.
