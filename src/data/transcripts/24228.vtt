Dear kitten, imagine a cat.

00:02.817 --> 00:06.718
Now, take away independence, cleanliness and intelligence.

00:07.045 --> 00:09.683
What you have left is basically a dog.

00:10.461 --> 00:11.269
Here's an example.

00:11.467 --> 00:16.129
Yesterday, I saw the dog sitting on his butt, scooching forward with his front paws.

00:16.297 --> 00:17.356
And he looked over at me.

00:17.839 --> 00:18.462
And you know what he said?

00:18.562 --> 00:19.963
He said, "Check it out."

00:20.165 --> 00:23.633
"I'm walking on two legs, just like the peoples do."

00:24.775 --> 00:27.520
I mean, it gives you an idea on what we're dealing with here.

00:27.953 --> 00:30.765
Dear kitten, the dog is the sort of creature...

00:31.010 --> 00:33.974
...that will decide whether it should put something in its mouth...

00:34.202 --> 00:36.233
...by putting it in its mouth.

00:36.485 --> 00:38.569
That's the level of decision-making that goes on.

00:38.718 --> 00:39.911
They basically eat everything.

00:40.133 --> 00:41.445
Case in point: butt paper.

00:41.695 --> 00:45.889
They even eat those weird, brown, dehydrated, pip nuggets that the humans give us.

00:46.029 --> 00:46.925
Don't get mad.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.105
Let the dog eat all of our dry food.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.656
If it gets caught, it gets put in jail.

00:52.115 --> 00:56.613
And right then, we can enjoy the moist deliciousness of the can without interruption.

00:57.467 --> 00:58.214
It's a gambit.
