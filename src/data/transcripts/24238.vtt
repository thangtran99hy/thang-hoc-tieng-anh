Many of us have tried growing a plant at home...

00:05.946 --> 00:08.001
...and failed simply not knowing how.

00:11.245 --> 00:16.598
We should be using technology not to disconnect but to connect with nature.

00:17.635 --> 00:18.989
We introduce Planty,...

00:19.547 --> 00:21.539
...the world's smartest garden pot.

00:24.962 --> 00:27.148
Planty records and monitors your plant...

00:27.732 --> 00:31.125
...and also analyzes the data to help you learn how to grow the plant...

00:32.666 --> 00:34.541
...while being connected via Wi-Fi.

00:36.839 --> 00:39.963
Growing a plant, flower or herb has never been easier.

00:41.034 --> 00:45.631
Using the app, you can water your plant from anywhere at any time.

00:49.433 --> 00:52.272
Check the temperature and humidity of Planty's environment.

00:53.769 --> 00:58.852
And when you're busy, Planty will alert you when it's too cold, needs water or light.

01:04.179 --> 01:07.027
Have fun and stay connected with others through Planty.
