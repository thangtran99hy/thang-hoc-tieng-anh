Hey, it's Keri with Buzz60.

00:02.350 --> 00:05.507
A new app that originated in China is now trending on iTunes...

00:05.586 --> 00:06.939
...and it's called MyIdol.

00:07.179 --> 00:09.295
It is quickly taking over social media.

00:09.707 --> 00:14.293
It takes a selfie and then it turns it into this amazing cartoon, like this.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.547
You take a picture and then upload it to the app...

00:16.683 --> 00:18.981
...and you have all kinds of choices of hair and clothes.

00:19.308 --> 00:21.460
Then you get to choose the activity and soundtrack.

00:21.882 --> 00:23.355
Definitely avoid "Let It Go."

00:23.612 --> 00:25.515
Most people are choosing pole dancing.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.921
Then you get a picture like this, which you share with your friends.

00:29.261 --> 00:32.557
You can move on in creating MyIdol images with famous pictures too.

00:32.903 --> 00:35.081
Of course, the 1D fandom is loving this app...

00:35.190 --> 00:38.184
...that lets them be the puppet masters of their favorite boy band.

00:38.567 --> 00:41.237
Louis is dancing like a female pop star from the 90s...

00:41.352 --> 00:45.457
...and Niall is taking his turn on the pole or Vladimir Putin on a pole.

00:45.747 --> 00:47.391
Or Nick Jonas just hanging out.
