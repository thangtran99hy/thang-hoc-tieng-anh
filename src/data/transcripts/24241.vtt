A baby's eyes and blink reflexes continue to develop long after birth.

00:09.497 --> 00:12.187
In fact, they don't always know when to close their eyes during a bath.

00:12.744 --> 00:15.685
That's why over 50 years ago, the makers of Johnson's Baby...

00:15.763 --> 00:18.413
...used their unique understanding of a baby's developing eyes...

00:18.482 --> 00:21.647
...to create Johnson's Baby Shampoo with its "No More Tears" formula.

00:25.086 --> 00:26.613
Okay, champ, bath time.

00:26.894 --> 00:28.945
Come on, I've had her that time.

00:29.129 --> 00:32.307
Not having a blink reflex does have its advantages.

00:33.986 --> 00:34.836
That's two out of three.

00:35.461 --> 00:36.744
Johnson's Baby Shampoo.
