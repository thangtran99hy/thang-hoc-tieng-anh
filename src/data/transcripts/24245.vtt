ï»¿If you're struggling to land that dream job,...

00:02.113 --> 00:05.900
...there might be a secret culprit: the font on your resume.

00:06.113 --> 00:07.758
Hey, I'm Mike Janela for Buzz60.

00:07.765 --> 00:10.401
Now, you're not supposed to make Internet videos with too much text in them,...

00:10.495 --> 00:11.949
...but I'm trying to help you get a job here.

00:12.292 --> 00:13.677
And a new study is out,...

00:13.929 --> 00:17.695
...showing us which fonts are the best and worst to use on a resume.

00:17.963 --> 00:19.168
The best of the best?

00:19.421 --> 00:22.185
That's Helvetica according to the professional typographers...

00:22.256 --> 00:23.659
...consulted by Bloomberg Business.

00:23.860 --> 00:25.931
The pros describe the 60-year-old font as...

00:26.203 --> 00:29.907
...professional, lighthearted, honest and beautiful.

00:30.194 --> 00:31.699
Is Helvetica free Friday night?

00:31.827 --> 00:35.741
Other winners include Garamond, which is scientifically easy on the eyes,...

00:36.018 --> 00:38.859
...and Proxima Nova, a softer version of Helvetica,...

00:39.120 --> 00:41.611
...but one's gonna cost you about 30 bucks online.

00:41.852 --> 00:44.471
But these next fonts are ones you should avoid.

00:44.702 --> 00:45.733
Times New Roman?

00:46.051 --> 00:49.196
Yeah, same font you use for every book report in middle school...

00:49.348 --> 00:53.783
...can be seen as lazy and quote, "like putting on sweatpants for a job interview."

00:54.118 --> 00:57.393
You can also forget about Zapfino and anything else in script,...

00:57.671 --> 00:59.947
...Courier and other typewriter-looking fonts.

01:00.333 --> 01:03.269
And if you needed someone to tell you Comic Sans was a bad idea,...

01:03.337 --> 01:05.037
...we've got bigger problems.

01:05.130 --> 01:06.483
Now, go open up Word.

01:06.549 --> 01:08.345
That resume is not gonna Helvetica itself.

01:08.754 --> 01:10.689
Buzz60: Now you know, pass it on.
