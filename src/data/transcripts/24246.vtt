00:04.549 --> 00:06.604
I remember that it was very windy.

00:07.494 --> 00:09.549
As a typhoon bears down on Taiwan,...

00:10.040 --> 00:13.981
...a 747 hurdles down the runway at Chiang Kai-shek Airport.

00:16.991 --> 00:20.411
Your chances of being in an airplane crash are vanishingly small.

00:21.549 --> 00:24.913
At a certain time, the plane kind of lost it.

00:28.291 --> 00:34.157
On October 31st, 2000, 159 passengers could not beat the odds.

00:35.174 --> 00:40.529
The east section people, they were killed by the fire and smoke.

00:42.191 --> 00:43.521
Many are left wondering.

00:43.972 --> 00:46.483
I was in the rear section of the aircraft.

00:47.325 --> 00:52.370
Could the key to surviving a plane crash be a matter of choosing the right seat?

00:52.775 --> 00:54.836
Run as far away as you can!
