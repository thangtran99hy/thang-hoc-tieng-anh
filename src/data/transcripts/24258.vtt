ï»¿Ever wonder what a sunset on Mars is like?

00:08.899 --> 00:11.672
Using the images taken by the Rover Opportunity,...

00:11.839 --> 00:14.591
...NASA has put together a Vine showing what it looks like.

00:15.003 --> 00:16.456
And it has quickly gone viral.

00:21.991 --> 00:26.197
The footage, which was originally released sometime ago, was digitally enhanced.

00:26.477 --> 00:28.619
In addition, frames were added to the sequence...

00:28.678 --> 00:31.511
...for the purpose of smoothing out the descending sun's movement.
