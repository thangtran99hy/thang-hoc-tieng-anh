Mike, you're reporting that Michael Jordan...

00:02.389 --> 00:07.593
...is the first US professional athlete to become a billionaire.

00:07.707 --> 00:08.309
That's right.

00:08.477 --> 00:09.459
How did he get there?

00:09.664 --> 00:14.686
Well, the last several months Kurt, Jordan, who is the majority owner of the Hornets...

00:14.777 --> 00:20.360
...and has been since 2010 when he bought out Robert Johnson for 175 million dollars,...

00:20.559 --> 00:27.509
...has been slowly increasing his ownership stake in the Hornets from 80% to 89.5%.

00:27.596 --> 00:31.786
I've confirmed this from two sources familiar with the Hornets' financial documents.

00:32.239 --> 00:36.537
People say the Hornets are worth between 600 million and 625 million.

00:36.722 --> 00:39.288
We go with that lower conservative number,...

00:39.831 --> 00:44.275
...that leaves Jordan's equity stake after subtracting debt...

00:44.629 --> 00:49.359
...and cash he used to increase his stake worth 416 million.

00:49.687 --> 00:54.388
When I take that net to his outside Hornet net worth which you calculate,...

00:54.788 --> 00:57.850
...we get a total net worth of a billion dollars for Jordan.
