00:02.157 --> 00:04.042
There's a new boss in my life.

00:04.298 --> 00:05.171
You're looking at it.

00:05.398 --> 00:07.153
Yup, it's a desk.

00:07.315 --> 00:09.549
The Stir Kinetic M1 is a standing desk,...

00:09.738 --> 00:12.191
...the kind that gets you up out of the comfy office chair...

00:12.352 --> 00:15.585
...that doctors say can contribute to heart disease and obesity.

00:15.975 --> 00:18.923
In case you haven't heard, sitting is the new smoking.

00:19.655 --> 00:22.100
But this standing desk isn't like the others.

00:22.301 --> 00:23.348
It's part-robot.

00:23.813 --> 00:27.717
All day long, the M1 logs my ups and downs and coaxes me to get moving.

00:28.298 --> 00:29.905
They call it a smart desk.

00:30.285 --> 00:36.251
I also call it a luxury because the M1 costs a cool $2990.

00:36.559 --> 00:39.915
When the M1 wants me to stand up, it starts heaving.

00:40.538 --> 00:42.341
They call this move a whisper breath.

00:43.085 --> 00:45.225
I double-tap the screen and up we go.

00:45.635 --> 00:49.368
My reward for 20 minutes of standing is another whisper breath.

00:49.923 --> 00:51.751
Double-tap, and we're headed back down.

00:52.073 --> 00:53.389
This method is effective.

00:53.779 --> 00:59.362
The M1's makers say that only 30% of people with ordinary movable desks actually use them daily.
