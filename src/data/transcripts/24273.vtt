00:00.424 --> 00:02.466
Right, so we're all happy to send this then?

00:02.605 --> 00:03.500
Yup, looks good to me.

00:03.607 --> 00:04.277
Yeah, me too.

00:04.660 --> 00:04.889
And me.

00:05.003 --> 00:07.610
Brilliant, brilliant. Good, all done, all shared.

00:07.893 --> 00:10.249
Okay, so when can we all get together to discuss the final changes?

00:10.517 --> 00:11.905
How is Tuesday?

00:12.217 --> 00:12.623
Tuesday, that's...

00:12.941 --> 00:13.191
Tuesday's good to me.

00:13.541 --> 00:14.377
We've done the changes.

00:15.105 --> 00:15.815
I've just sent them off.

00:16.200 --> 00:16.985
So, what are the next steps?

00:17.055 --> 00:17.620
There are none.

00:17.702 --> 00:18.877
We are finished.

00:19.009 --> 00:20.230
Okay, but we should talk anyway.

00:20.309 --> 00:21.291
I'll give you a call a bit later.

00:21.737 --> 00:23.454
Can do if you want to but there's really no need.

00:23.928 --> 00:24.971
So, what's there left to do now?

00:26.097 --> 00:27.000
I'm gonna get lunch.

00:27.424 --> 00:28.991
Okay, where are you headed?

00:29.609 --> 00:31.015
Panini. Sounds good.
