00:06.184 --> 00:06.791
Welcome home.

00:08.033 --> 00:09.331
Should I call you King Charles?

00:12.219 --> 00:13.101
Queen Charles?

00:13.423 --> 00:15.095
I like to just keep it loose in this house.

00:15.933 --> 00:17.402
There's no wrong way to sit on the couch.

00:18.421 --> 00:21.148
Chloe! I kind of like the sound of that.

00:22.687 --> 00:23.393
Chloe it is.

00:25.473 --> 00:25.935
Check it out.

00:27.654 --> 00:29.684
This is like good soccer practice too, isn't it?

00:30.661 --> 00:30.997
I'm fine.

00:31.149 --> 00:31.511
I'm fine.

00:31.753 --> 00:32.493
See, you gotta be careful.

00:35.768 --> 00:36.333
Are you hungry?

00:37.492 --> 00:38.505
Can we get some breakfast?

00:46.462 --> 00:47.108
Nice!

00:50.615 --> 00:51.877
I think this is gonna work out great.
