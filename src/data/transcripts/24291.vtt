00:09.697 --> 00:12.662
What lurks beneath the planet Jupiter's cloud cover?

00:13.086 --> 00:15.997
Scientists hope to find out when NASA's Juno spacecraft...

00:16.093 --> 00:18.575
...begins its one-year orbit of the massive planet.

00:19.046 --> 00:21.157
Juno Project Manager, Jan Chodas.

00:21.428 --> 00:24.258
So, here I have a model of the Juno Spacecraft.

00:24.360 --> 00:28.045
The core structure contains our propulsion tanks...

00:28.151 --> 00:31.883
...and most of the instruments are mounted on the forward and aft decks.

00:33.232 --> 00:36.907
But obviously, the dominant feature here are the large solar arrays.

00:37.139 --> 00:39.735
Juno's wings are covered in solar cells.

00:39.947 --> 00:44.483
And the craft will rely on solar energy as it spins through space for the next five years.

00:45.063 --> 00:46.853
At its closest approach to Jupiter,...

00:47.153 --> 00:50.517
...Juno will be about 5,000 kilometers above the cloud tops...

00:50.809 --> 00:54.127
...and it will dip down below the planet's dangerous radiation belts.

00:54.797 --> 00:56.862
Juno will spend a year in polar orbit...

00:57.078 --> 01:00.669
...and its eight instruments will study Jupiter's magnetic and gravity fields,...

01:01.019 --> 01:03.973
...as well as the composition of the planet's atmosphere and core.

01:04.727 --> 01:09.277
NASA scientists say this information will help them answer key questions about the way Jupiter...

01:09.418 --> 01:11.359
...and the solar system evolved.

01:11.639 --> 01:17.110
Chodas uses an animation to explain the beginning of Juno's 640-million-kilometer track...

01:17.361 --> 01:20.298
...from NASA's Kennedy Space Center to the colossal planet.

01:20.455 --> 01:24.672
Shortly after launch, about five minutes, we start the solar array deploy sequence.

01:24.992 --> 01:25.995
There go the arrays.

01:26.078 --> 01:30.771
It should take probably about one to three minutes to get the arrays out.

01:31.031 --> 01:35.442
And then, if we are left at an attitude that is not directly sun-pointed,...

01:35.533 --> 01:38.211
...we will turn to within 20 degrees of the sun...

01:38.294 --> 01:41.203
...to illuminate the arrays and start recharging the battery.

01:41.575 --> 01:43.885
And that will be putting us on our way to Jupiter...

01:44.222 --> 01:47.642
...and possibly bringing us closer to a better understanding of the universe,...

01:47.839 --> 01:50.491
...once Juno reaches Jupiter in 2016.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.950
