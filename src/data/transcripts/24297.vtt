00:01.391 --> 00:03.731
ï»¿Welcome aboard and thanks for flying with Delta.

00:04.062 --> 00:06.419
Our first priority on every flight is safety.

00:06.605 --> 00:09.922
So before we depart, I'll be giving a brief safety presentation.

00:10.473 --> 00:14.851
Okay, be sure all carry-on items are securely stored in an overhead bin...

00:15.526 --> 00:18.113
...and place smaller items under the seat in front of you...

00:19.505 --> 00:23.074
...and ensure all aisles, exits and bulkhead areas are clear.

00:23.849 --> 00:27.615
And ensure your mobile phones and electronic devices are turned off.

00:30.355 --> 00:32.308
If you're seated at an emergency exit,...

00:32.751 --> 00:35.831
...please review the responsibilities for emergency exit seating...

00:35.989 --> 00:39.274
...on the back of the Safety Information Card, which is in your seat pocket.

00:39.522 --> 00:43.198
Are you willing and able to assist with the operation of the exit if necessary?

00:43.837 --> 00:44.340
Yes.

00:44.900 --> 00:45.300
Not really.

00:45.721 --> 00:47.631
If you are unable to perform these functions,...

00:47.851 --> 00:50.572
...please let us know and we'd be happy to find you another seat.

00:51.637 --> 00:51.957
Hey.

00:52.077 --> 00:52.355
Hey.

00:52.965 --> 00:55.784
As we leave the gate, make sure your seatbelt is fastened.

00:56.130 --> 00:59.613
To fasten, insert the metal tip into the buckle and adjust the strap...

00:59.701 --> 01:01.328
...so it's low and tight across your lap.

01:02.066 --> 01:04.253
To release the belt, just lift the top of the buckle.

01:04.862 --> 01:07.509
Please remain seated with your seatbelt securely fastened...

01:07.619 --> 01:09.075
..anytime the seatbelt sign is on,...

01:09.544 --> 01:10.714
...and even if the sign is off,...

01:10.955 --> 01:14.793
...please keep your seatbelt fastened in case we experience unexpected rough air.

01:18.935 --> 01:22.481
For everyone's safety, federal regulations require all passengers...

01:22.572 --> 01:25.542
...to comply with the posted placards and lighted information signs...

01:25.632 --> 01:29.386
...located throughout the cabin, in addition to any crew member instructions.

01:30.254 --> 01:33.596
Smoking is not allowed on any Delta flight,...

01:34.304 --> 01:35.431
...and federal law prohibits...

01:35.515 --> 01:38.731
...tampering with, disabling or destroying a restroom smoke detector.
