00:00.226 --> 00:02.604
I see trees of green,...

00:04.505 --> 00:05.982
...red roses too.

00:07.235 --> 00:11.319
I see them bloom for me and you.

00:13.071 --> 00:20.110
And I think to myself, "What a wonderful world."

00:26.493 --> 00:31.673
I see skies of blue, clouds of white,...

00:33.399 --> 00:38.889
...bright blessed days, dark sacred nights.

00:40.915 --> 00:46.970
And I think to myself, "What a wonderful world."

00:53.340 --> 00:58.175
The colors of a rainbow so pretty in the sky...

01:00.888 --> 01:04.416
...are also on the faces of people going by.

01:06.364 --> 01:12.078
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"

01:13.690 --> 01:17.755
They're really saying, "I love you."

01:19.692 --> 01:25.201
I hear babies cry, I watch them grow.

01:27.418 --> 01:31.743
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know.

01:32.985 --> 01:38.951
And I think to myself, "What a wonderful world."
