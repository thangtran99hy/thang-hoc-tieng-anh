00:00.369 --> 00:00.965
You know what's nice?

00:01.177 --> 00:06.434
I went backstage to say hi before the show and your mom was there.

00:06.621 --> 00:10.165
You introduced me and I always think it's nice...

00:10.252 --> 00:15.987
...when people bring their family along with them to showbiz occasions or events.

00:16.173 --> 00:16.941
I think it's kind of cool.

00:17.065 --> 00:18.375
Yeah, it's kind of fun.

00:18.777 --> 00:19.597
Who did you bring?

00:21.904 --> 00:24.162
You were nominated for a Golden Globe and you brought,...

00:24.301 --> 00:24.749
...who did you bring?

00:24.868 --> 00:25.472
I brought my mom.

00:26.107 --> 00:28.573
I brought that same lady and we sat,...

00:28.878 --> 00:30.047
...that same one.

00:30.955 --> 00:31.716
The same mom.

00:33.716 --> 00:36.661
We sat at a table next to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie,...

00:37.572 --> 00:39.669
...which is like, the ultimate thing to bring your mom to.

00:39.782 --> 00:40.169
Sure.

00:40.591 --> 00:45.065
Because she never drinks and there was this giant bottle of Moet Champagne,...

00:45.131 --> 00:46.636
...because they were sponsoring the event.

00:47.393 --> 00:52.381
And so, she had a lot of champagne and she was talking to them about their kids,...

00:52.807 --> 00:57.228
...which was really interesting and funny.

00:57.407 --> 00:59.599
So, your mom was getting pretty loose at the time.

01:00.322 --> 01:04.359
She was like, "Now, you guys must be so tired."

01:04.845 --> 01:05.766
"You two."

01:06.003 --> 01:09.121
And she was leaning over me to Angelina Jolie and I'm like,...

01:10.866 --> 01:13.414
...and Angelina was like, "Yeah, you know, all these kids."

01:13.511 --> 01:14.994
My mom was like, "No, how old is the old?"

01:15.077 --> 01:19.431
"They grow up so fast, you're gonna... it flies, it flies."

01:20.101 --> 01:23.039
And I was like, "Oh boy... Oh boy."
