ï»¿She's an amazing human being and she is caring...

00:03.293 --> 00:07.103
...and she also happens to be one of the smartest people I've ever met.

00:07.193 --> 00:08.509
And she's got a great sense of humor.

00:08.781 --> 00:14.379
There's a number of reasons why, but she does do some of the things she takes on.

00:14.815 --> 00:15.756
And I've always been very proud of her...

00:15.847 --> 00:18.607

00:18.711 --> 00:21.105
...in Strasbourg with her robe on.

00:21.719 --> 00:22.437

00:27.541 --> 00:32.681
She's always, since the day I met her, she's always had this insanely,...

00:33.852 --> 00:36.893
...it's eccentric but it's fun, sense of fashion.

00:37.110 --> 00:40.464
It has been sort of fascinating to watch and see...

00:40.551 --> 00:41.626
...because she has such great taste.
