00:04.511 --> 00:08.435
Long ago, we looked upon a foreboding sky.

00:10.755 --> 00:16.106
The memory of the star that threatened all burns eternal in our hearts.

00:22.347 --> 00:25.474
In its wake came an age of silence.

00:30.327 --> 00:34.502
But after the long calm, there are now the beginnings of a stir.

00:36.545 --> 00:40.612
The reunion at hand may bring joy, it may bring fear,...

00:41.375 --> 00:44.279
...but let us embrace whatever it brings.

00:48.875 --> 00:51.239
For they are coming back.

00:54.315 --> 00:58.131
At last, the promise has been made.
