00:01.237 --> 00:03.081
This time, things will be different.

00:03.853 --> 00:05.064
The new kid is coming.

00:05.798 --> 00:06.358
Wow!

00:06.439 --> 00:07.669
She is pretty.

00:07.785 --> 00:09.361
She's not that pretty.

00:13.272 --> 00:14.298
She looked at me!

00:16.121 --> 00:18.412
I can't believe I'm about to talk to the new girl.

00:18.545 --> 00:21.493
If there's one person you want by your side at a moment like this,...

00:21.645 --> 00:22.827
...it's your loyal dog.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.979
I'm going to change who I am and become a winner.

00:36.994 --> 00:38.418
Charlie Brown?

00:39.123 --> 00:42.209
Snoopy, what would I do without a good friend like you?

00:44.653 --> 00:46.319
The Peanuts Movie.

00:46.475 --> 00:48.577
A dog just loves you for who you are.

00:48.758 --> 00:50.993
It's nice to have someone that will listen to you.
