00:01.223 --> 00:04.063
So the phone itself, as we've all seen in the teaser and promo material,...

00:04.469 --> 00:05.683
...is pretty badass-looking.

00:05.900 --> 00:08.789
It's rocking that red coat of paint on the front and the back,...

00:09.091 --> 00:11.362
...with a gold color on the metal side bezels...

00:11.735 --> 00:14.407
...and that Iron Man helmet painted on the back.

00:14.753 --> 00:15.893
This is an awesome combo,...

00:16.126 --> 00:19.276
...obviously a pretty flashy-looking phone from pretty much every angle.

00:19.688 --> 00:23.609
And since the Galaxy S6 has so much reflective glass and metal,...

00:23.857 --> 00:25.915
...it's one of the most eye-catching phones I've ever seen.

00:26.338 --> 00:29.899
You may also notice that limited edition print on the bottom.

00:30.317 --> 00:31.976
Not sure how many of these were actually made,...

00:32.250 --> 00:33.403
...but there are only four digits.

00:33.728 --> 00:36.291
And yeah, this is just not your average-looking smartphone.

00:36.709 --> 00:38.393
And it's not just the hardware that's unique, too.

00:38.787 --> 00:42.397
You also have probably noticed the software is pretty special as well.

00:42.579 --> 00:45.107
The Iron Man Galaxy S6 is rocking an exclusive theme,...

00:45.400 --> 00:48.735
...actually a variant of the Iron Man theme that's already in the Samsung theme store,...

00:49.033 --> 00:50.825
...but with gold accents instead of silver.

00:51.471 --> 00:53.577
So, this theme affects the whole look of the phone,...

00:53.900 --> 00:57.127
...so the wallpaper, the lock screen, the icons,...

00:57.400 --> 00:59.893
...everything you look at on the home screen, all of that stuff.

01:00.052 --> 01:03.250
And it's made its way actually into stuff like the stock apps too,...

01:03.350 --> 01:06.207
...the dialer, it's in the contacts, the messages,...

01:06.500 --> 01:08.958
...and it basically gives them all of this red and gold look,...

01:09.580 --> 01:11.611
...or adds like a red and gold background everywhere.

01:11.900 --> 01:14.704
This is something a collector would buy and like, basically never use.

01:14.950 --> 01:17.797
They put it up in a glass case on display and never touch it.
