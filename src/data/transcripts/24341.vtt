Planet Traveler introduces the Space Case 1,...

00:03.902 --> 00:06.239
...the world's most advanced smart suitcase.

00:07.211 --> 00:10.765
When we designed the case, we wanted to give you the ultimate security.

00:11.291 --> 00:14.647
That's why we've added a biometric lock with fingerprint recognition...

00:15.049 --> 00:17.871
...that grants you access to opening or closing your suitcase...

00:18.147 --> 00:20.604
...simply with the touch of your finger or through the app.

00:23.174 --> 00:26.261
Space Case 1 is linked to a multifunctional smartphone app.

00:26.607 --> 00:28.801
The global tracker provides real-time tracking...

00:29.155 --> 00:32.315
...and maintains a record of your case's location throughout the world.

00:33.771 --> 00:36.206
You never need worry about overweight fees.

00:36.371 --> 00:40.656
Our digital self scale weighs your suitcase even without you lifting the case.

00:41.063 --> 00:45.720
Incredible innovation and design has led us to build the sensors into the wheels,...

00:46.019 --> 00:49.767
...so you are hands-free and the weight is visible on your Planet Traveler app.
