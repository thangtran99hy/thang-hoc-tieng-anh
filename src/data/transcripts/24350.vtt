ï»¿Barbara Walters interviewed me two years ago...

00:02.925 --> 00:04.767
...and she said, "Is that really your hair?"

00:08.800 --> 00:13.082
Donald Trump is a business tycoon, investor, television personality...

00:13.415 --> 00:15.107
...and now, a candidate for President.

00:16.109 --> 00:22.938
I am officially running for President of the United States.

00:23.697 --> 00:25.818
But when you think of the Donald's many attributes,...

00:26.006 --> 00:28.167
...one thing trumps 'em all: his hair.

00:28.918 --> 00:32.364
Swept back, shrouded in the shadows, or half hidden under a hat,...

00:32.676 --> 00:34.857
...over the years, Trump's hair has bobbed and weaved.

00:36.533 --> 00:38.494
While some believe he's wearing a hairpiece,...

00:38.694 --> 00:40.346
...Trump says his hair is au naturel.

00:41.171 --> 00:44.531
Is it true, because I'm looking at it and I'm close to pulling it.

00:44.656 --> 00:45.737
There is nothing but his own hair.

00:46.269 --> 00:47.215
It's actually my hair.

00:47.774 --> 00:50.227
He even used the ice bucket challenge to prove it was real.

00:50.914 --> 00:54.639
I guess they want to see whether or not it's my real hair.

00:59.180 --> 01:02.358
Through the years, Trump's golden locks have moved around.

01:02.792 --> 01:06.277
But one thing has stayed the same: his enthusiasm for his signature style.

01:06.767 --> 01:10.014
They say, "You wear the worst hairpiece I've ever seen."

01:10.428 --> 01:11.891
"What a horrible wig."

01:12.167 --> 01:14.521
No, I mean it's actually my hair.
