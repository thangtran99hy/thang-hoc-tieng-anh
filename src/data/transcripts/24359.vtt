I was setting up the bridal party...

00:01.707 --> 00:05.497
...to take the bridal party photographs like I do at every wedding,...

00:05.865 --> 00:08.992
...and so I took a few shots of that, and then I said,...

00:09.110 --> 00:10.691
"Okay, now I need the bride and groom to kiss."

00:11.240 --> 00:16.068
So when I said that, well naturally, she thought I was referring to her...

00:16.175 --> 00:18.180
...because she thought she was the bride.

00:18.263 --> 00:23.445
And so, naturally she just leaned in for a kiss and kissed that ring bearer.

00:23.741 --> 00:27.417
Guess what? When mom and Ike kissed, Ikey and I kissed.

00:28.118 --> 00:30.567
I was trying to get Ikey to kiss me.

00:31.113 --> 00:35.386
I said, "Okay, let's try that again. One more time, bride and groom kiss."

00:36.176 --> 00:39.397
And she really went for it that time and it was hilarious.

00:39.657 --> 00:42.735
I strive to capture the moment of the day,...

00:43.089 --> 00:45.297
...so for me to be able to capture that moment,...

00:45.513 --> 00:50.554
...that's a moment that the families can look back on for years to come...

00:50.857 --> 00:54.989
...and laugh and relive it over again.

00:55.345 --> 00:59.135
He was the best ring bearer ever.

00:59.589 --> 01:04.716
And he thought I was the best flower girl ever.

01:05.758 --> 01:07.017
We're best friends.
