00:00.050 --> 00:02.387
Are there fears left that you have not conquered yet?

00:02.785 --> 00:03.797
What are you afraid of?

00:03.892 --> 00:06.924
Oh, wow. Probably singing,...

00:07.711 --> 00:09.508
...singing would be a huge fear in a movie.

00:09.598 --> 00:10.224
Where's my microphone?

00:10.301 --> 00:11.901
No! No, no, I'm not doing that now.

00:11.976 --> 00:12.689
I'm way too afraid.

00:12.961 --> 00:14.276
But you're not scared of anything else?

00:15.311 --> 00:17.553
Yes, I actually am, in real life.

00:17.667 --> 00:18.623
Yes, that's what I mean.

00:18.754 --> 00:21.027
In real life, I'm terrified of porcelain dolls.

00:21.190 --> 00:21.902
I heard that.

00:22.531 --> 00:24.876
Now, did something happen to you when you were a child?

00:25.197 --> 00:27.473
Did a porcelain doll fall on you when you were sleeping?

00:28.749 --> 00:29.457
I don't think so.

00:29.841 --> 00:34.781
There was like a TV show that had like, it was Friday the 13th where there's a possessed porcelain doll,...

00:34.859 --> 00:36.327
...but I just think they're freaky.

00:36.683 --> 00:38.250
I just think they're really super freaky.

00:38.337 --> 00:40.268
They have like, real eyes and they look real.

00:40.382 --> 00:44.315
And I just imagine when I walk by them, their heads turn with you the whole time.
