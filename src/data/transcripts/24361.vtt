I first decided I would like to have a music career when I was about 14.

00:07.717 --> 00:11.857
And I remember I thought I could probably get a record deal in a year.

00:12.161 --> 00:13.242
That was what I thought.

00:13.387 --> 00:15.490
It takes a year, it's pretty easy.

00:15.897 --> 00:18.567
And I thought, all I had to do is see my potential.

00:18.661 --> 00:23.430
So, I'll record three songs and I'll send this three-song demo to a label.

00:23.511 --> 00:26.389
I'll send it to every label and one of them will pick me.

00:26.493 --> 00:31.273
That's what I thought in my insane mind when I was 14...

00:31.396 --> 00:33.003
...and I thought that would be a great idea,...

00:33.088 --> 00:37.085
...but I didn't get a record deal until I was 22, so it took a lot longer.

00:37.196 --> 00:38.638
But I had big dreams.
