Hi! I'm Rashida Jones and I'm at WIRED where it's all work and all play.

00:10.317 --> 00:14.353
I am co-writing Toy Story 4 with my writing partner Will McCormack.

00:14.648 --> 00:20.365
I just wrapped on a new TV show called "Angie Tribeca" for TBS, which comes out on the fall.

00:20.687 --> 00:25.034
Will and I have a TV production company which just finished a pilot for ABC,...

00:25.321 --> 00:27.152
...a family drama called "Mix."

00:29.115 --> 00:35.531
My dad gives really good advice but he told me to pick two things to pursue.

00:35.757 --> 00:39.403
Just get really good at those things and know everything you can about those two things.

00:39.645 --> 00:45.511
Feel lucky that you're able to do something that you love because that is a huge gift.
