Today, I'm gonna show you a great way to serve a watermelon.

00:03.448 --> 00:06.357
And we're gonna start by using a sharp knife to cut it in half.

00:08.264 --> 00:11.893
Rather than just cutting off a slice like this, which can be messy and awkward to eat,...

00:12.836 --> 00:15.347
...we're going to turn half the melon over onto a chopping board.

00:15.503 --> 00:20.204
Then, using our knife, cut strips about an inch wide all the way up the watermelon like this.

00:22.910 --> 00:26.046
Next, we're gonna turn it around and do exactly the same again.

00:27.887 --> 00:30.323
Try and hold the melon altogether while you're doing it.

00:31.637 --> 00:34.161
And there we have it: simple and ready to serve.

00:34.791 --> 00:37.017
Just pull a piece out and it's ready to eat.

00:38.927 --> 00:40.981
Great for parties and sharing with friends.
