We've been wanting to come to Lolla for years.

00:03.296 --> 00:06.125
It's a huge event with an incredible lineup of bands...

00:06.400 --> 00:08.897
...smack in the middle of a big, beautiful city.

00:09.617 --> 00:13.718
The days start off casual with front and center spots for the up-and-coming artists.

00:15.912 --> 00:20.167
And as the day progresses, the more insane everything gets.

00:25.447 --> 00:31.055
Over three days, we jammed for 30 hours, walked approximately 20 miles,...

00:31.400 --> 00:36.390
...drank a dozen or so Chicago beers and gorged ourselves on various types of street food.

00:43.177 --> 00:45.127
I'm proud of those stats for one weekend.

00:45.478 --> 00:49.201
But what really makes me happy is knowing that at the end of the day,...

00:49.459 --> 00:51.037
...I get to crash in my own bed.
