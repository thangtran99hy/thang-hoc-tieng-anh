ï»¿Marc Chagall's contemporaries banished God from their works.

00:05.759 --> 00:09.145
But for him, painting was inconceivable without transcendence.

00:09.610 --> 00:12.623
As he once said, "The artist is a messenger of God."

00:15.476 --> 00:19.186
His life is a reflection of much of the 20th century's biggest stories.

00:19.416 --> 00:22.732
A Russian Jew, he witnessed World War I and the Russian Revolution.

00:23.193 --> 00:26.616
He sought refuge in the United States after Nazi Germany's rise.

00:28.142 --> 00:30.901
Despite all the suffering, his painting never lost color.

00:31.337 --> 00:34.693
He said that it was because color is how he expressed his emotions.

00:35.467 --> 00:37.365
A fascination with this artistic giant...

00:37.471 --> 00:39.974
...has brought visitors from around the world to his exhibit.

00:42.041 --> 00:44.759
The message is extremely love.

00:44.948 --> 00:48.855
Love is the most important thing of life.

00:49.989 --> 00:53.614
And don't use too much your heads but your hearts.

00:53.833 --> 00:54.638
That's Chagall.

00:55.423 --> 00:59.856
The Love and Life exhibition will be in Rome until July 26th, 2016.

01:00.143 --> 01:04.383
It traces the life of the painter through what Chagall called the engine of life: love.

01:05.092 --> 01:09.015
If anything characterizes him, it is his famous scenes of lovers,...

01:09.165 --> 01:10.909
...all inspired by his wife Bella.

01:11.175 --> 01:14.127
The artist said in his autobiography that his country was his soul.

01:14.468 --> 01:16.843
He could travel without a passport whenever he wanted.

01:17.217 --> 01:18.968
Now, for a few weeks in Rome,...

01:19.319 --> 01:23.522
...one can join this unique artist for a short journey without carrying documents.
