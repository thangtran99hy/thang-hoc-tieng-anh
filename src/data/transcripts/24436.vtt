00:00.207 --> 00:01.645
My name is Ali Abu Awwad.

00:01.732 --> 00:08.417
I'm a Palestinian who was born in West Bank from a refugee family.

00:08.513 --> 00:10.097
I was born to a political family.

00:10.713 --> 00:16.163
My mother was in prison for resisting the Israeli occupation.

00:16.247 --> 00:21.453
I was in prison for four years and I have lost my older brother Youssef.

00:22.117 --> 00:23.625
He was 31 years old.

00:24.146 --> 00:25.971
He was killed by Israeli soldiers.

00:26.158 --> 00:32.559
From that background, I have decided to take the pain to another direction,...

00:32.795 --> 00:35.780
...investing it for a better future.

00:36.056 --> 00:39.300
When I was in prison, I started studying about nonviolence.

00:39.683 --> 00:43.693
Nonviolence is the best art, it's a human art.

00:44.043 --> 00:47.283
This is the most honest and difficult place.

00:48.022 --> 00:51.696
And when I say "painful hope", it is painful.

00:52.134 --> 00:55.382
Peace is painful because it is a solution,...

00:56.063 --> 00:57.773
...because it is a responsibility.

00:58.861 --> 01:01.805
It is a place to reconcile with yourself, first of all.

01:03.192 --> 01:08.603
After a process, after years, I found that the Palestinian freedom...

01:08.802 --> 01:14.003
...should pass through Jewish hearts and minds.

01:14.793 --> 01:18.335
If we can create trust and overcome the fear...

01:19.167 --> 01:25.390
...and really build a realistic partnership which can work on the ground together,...

01:26.401 --> 01:30.409
...we will be the happiest two nations on the planet.

01:30.645 --> 01:36.081
So this book is not another story about a nice Palestinian who's talking about peace.

01:36.417 --> 01:36.771
No.

01:38.464 --> 01:44.599
It's a Palestinian who has been involved and engaged in violence and knows very well...

01:45.319 --> 01:50.735
...that nonviolence is the best way to freedom and security for both sides.

01:51.677 --> 01:53.345
Just through reconciliation,...

01:53.723 --> 01:59.535
...you can create a bridge between the painful past and a better future.

02:00.384 --> 02:01.865
And this is what we need.

02:02.693 --> 02:07.305
So through your help, by supporting my book,...

02:07.575 --> 02:12.366
...I think we can really, together, make a difference in the Middle East.
