00:04.361 --> 00:10.114
He saw the universal capacity to carry out harms of great magnitude.

00:11.211 --> 00:13.225
Lemkin knew that no one was safe.

00:16.327 --> 00:20.915
Raphael Lemkin was a Polish Jew and when Hitler invaded Poland,...

00:21.033 --> 00:24.084
...47 members of his family were herded up and killed.

00:24.789 --> 00:28.713
I became interested in terrible suffering because it happened so many times.

00:29.113 --> 00:31.743
I said to myself, "I'm going to do something about it."

00:33.977 --> 00:37.533
Lemkin came up with a new idea to transform these massacres into a crime.

00:38.707 --> 00:39.887
Something clicked in him.

00:40.225 --> 00:42.165
Maybe if I had a better word,...

00:42.475 --> 00:46.328
...maybe then, governments would ban the mass murder of civilians.

00:47.397 --> 00:47.927
Genocide.

00:48.790 --> 00:49.753
So, he has a word.

00:50.135 --> 00:50.737
Now what?

00:52.217 --> 00:56.347
How did one little guy go about trying to reform the world?

00:56.564 --> 00:59.898
Lemkin turned himself into a one-man lobbying machine.

01:00.563 --> 01:03.532
The convention was adopted by unanimous fashion.

01:03.655 --> 01:06.854
Let's open up the world and let light and knowledge come in.

01:08.966 --> 01:10.304
Today is a milestone.

01:10.479 --> 01:14.222
No criminal court has filed genocide charges against the President of Sudan.

01:14.749 --> 01:17.111
This monstrous conflict has to come to an end.

01:17.965 --> 01:19.893
I am myself a survivor of genocide.

01:21.446 --> 01:23.146
These people are waiting for our protection.

01:23.454 --> 01:25.455
We don't need to wait until he's finished his work.

01:26.834 --> 01:27.883
That was Lemkin's point,...

01:28.471 --> 01:31.336
...that perpetrators will be watched, that they will be accountable.

01:34.045 --> 01:36.703
I think, at a certain time, we have to stop and say,...

01:37.219 --> 01:37.919
"We stop here."

01:41.279 --> 01:43.297
The law is the difference between life or death.

01:44.823 --> 01:45.509
I cannot fail.

01:45.741 --> 01:46.316
We cannot fail.

01:51.796 --> 01:55.179
I always think about the privilege of getting to try,...

01:55.651 --> 01:56.311
...just to try.
