00:00.029 --> 00:04.944
I'd started a business before that I raised four million bucks of other people's money,...

00:05.759 --> 00:08.860
...started a web marketing company,...

00:09.229 --> 00:11.983
..went boom and bust with the first dot-com boom and bust.

00:12.291 --> 00:15.421
I knew I wanted to make it as an entrepreneur and start another business,...

00:15.561 --> 00:17.189
...but I had no idea what I wanted to do.

00:18.043 --> 00:21.860
And so for inspiration, I went surfing...

00:22.173 --> 00:25.651
...and I planned a five-month surf trip around Australia and Indonesia.

00:26.011 --> 00:27.896
The inspiration came before I even left.

00:28.203 --> 00:32.627
I wanted to capture photos of myself and my friends...

00:32.738 --> 00:35.874
...that I was going on the trip with while we were surfing out in the water,...

00:36.515 --> 00:39.176
...and no camera existed that allowed you to do that.

00:39.727 --> 00:42.292
And so I set out to develop this wrist harness...

00:42.412 --> 00:45.784
...that I could put a single-use disposable camera into and surf with it.

00:47.541 --> 00:50.278
And I didn't even mean it to be a business idea.

00:50.501 --> 00:52.953
I just wanted to document my experience on this trip.

00:53.802 --> 00:57.849
And as soon as I got it working well, the light bulb went off and I realized,...

00:58.584 --> 01:01.949
"Oh my god, there must be so many other surfers in the world...

01:02.113 --> 01:03.258
...that want something like this."
