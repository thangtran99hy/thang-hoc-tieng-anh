Everyone's pretty clear that there are dog people and there are cat people.

00:03.799 --> 00:05.049
Yes, there are people that are both,...

00:05.167 --> 00:07.585
...but we're looking simplicity here so let's move on.

00:07.721 --> 00:09.971
And according to research from Carroll University,...

00:10.145 --> 00:12.737
...cat people are the smarter of those two groups.

00:12.943 --> 00:14.690
The researchers surveyed 600 students...

00:14.795 --> 00:17.515
...and aside from asking them questions about their personality,...

00:17.602 --> 00:20.631
...they also asked how they felt about dogs and cats.

00:21.017 --> 00:25.312
For the record, 60% are dog people, 11% are cat people.

00:25.641 --> 00:27.551
The rest liked either both or neither.

00:27.711 --> 00:32.383
Dog people valued the companionship from their pet while cat owners liked the affection.

00:32.758 --> 00:36.891
But when paired with the personality traits, these results got really interesting.

00:37.071 --> 00:41.239
Cat lovers scored higher on intelligence tests than dog lovers.

00:41.575 --> 00:45.832
They also tended to be introverted, nonconformist, open-minded, sensitive thinkers.

00:46.006 --> 00:51.364
Conversely, dog lovers were more energetic, outgoing, extroverted and meticulous.
