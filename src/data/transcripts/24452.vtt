If you just laughed out loud after watching that cat...

00:03.697 --> 00:06.179
...or countless other cat videos online, keep it up.

00:06.435 --> 00:07.428
They're good for your health.

00:07.603 --> 00:09.606
Hey everyone, I'm Sean Dowling from Buzz60...

00:09.787 --> 00:12.813
...and new research is basically telling me that how I spend my Friday nights...

00:12.904 --> 00:14.375
...is keeping the doctor away.

00:14.526 --> 00:18.734
Indiana University media school researchers surveyed nearly 7,000 people...

00:18.807 --> 00:20.985
...for a study in computers and human behavior,...

00:21.293 --> 00:23.810
...about viewing cat videos and how it affects their moods.

00:24.003 --> 00:24.850
What did they find?

00:26.960 --> 00:30.371
Participants reported cute cat videos like this had a positive effect on them,...

00:30.457 --> 00:32.576
...making them feel more energetic.

00:32.705 --> 00:35.561
They also had fewer negative emotions like sadness or anger.

00:35.731 --> 00:38.028
So turn that frown upside down, Grumpy Cat.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.933
The study also showed people watch cat videos when they're at work...

00:41.030 --> 00:44.385
...or supposed to be studying, but they didn't feel guilty procrastinating...

00:44.471 --> 00:46.017
...because they got a good laugh out of it.

00:46.121 --> 00:47.338
And how could you not?

00:49.775 --> 00:51.759
Researchers also point out that last year,...

00:51.861 --> 00:55.077
...cat videos were watched 26 billion times on Youtube,...

00:55.341 --> 00:57.355
...more than any other category on the site.

00:57.525 --> 01:00.477
But if everyone is watching cat videos while they're supposed to be working,...

01:00.729 --> 01:02.406
...how is anything actually getting done?

01:02.689 --> 01:03.477
Buzz60.

01:03.563 --> 01:04.780
Now you know, pass it on.
