ï»¿To diagnose tuberculosis, doctors must analyze an average of 100 images.

00:06.850 --> 00:10.240
It's a long process that requires identifying and counting the bacteria,...

00:10.331 --> 00:11.451
...which cause the disease.

00:12.242 --> 00:16.747
The researchers behind a new program called TuberSpot want to make the practice more attractive.

00:17.126 --> 00:20.587
That's why they've created a video game platform to diagnose the disease.

00:21.411 --> 00:24.421
Players can help analyze actual images of patient samples,...

00:24.516 --> 00:26.388
...and they don't have to be experts in medicine.

00:26.729 --> 00:30.401
The game requires them to seek and hunt bacteria before they run out of time.

00:31.568 --> 00:34.631
Tuberculosis affects the lungs and the disease spreads through the air.

00:34.861 --> 00:39.197
According to the World Health Organization, ten million people develop TB every year.

00:39.513 --> 00:42.145
It killed more than one million humans in 2013.

00:42.888 --> 00:46.723
Spanish researchers created TuberSpot for International Tuberculosis Day,...

00:46.835 --> 00:48.530
...which takes place on March 24th.

00:48.959 --> 00:51.159
The application is now available on Google Play...

00:51.398 --> 00:53.728
...and can be played on desktop web browsers too.
