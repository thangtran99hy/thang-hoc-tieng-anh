You named her after a girl who spoke out and was killed.

00:05.034 --> 00:07.268
It's almost as if you said, "She'll be different."

00:07.469 --> 00:07.845
You're right.

00:10.047 --> 00:14.691
I am those 66 million girls who are deprived of education.

00:15.569 --> 00:16.833
I am not a lone voice.

00:17.523 --> 00:18.303
I am many.

00:19.167 --> 00:21.976
And our voices are our most powerful weapons.

00:23.004 --> 00:29.069
One child, one teacher, one book, and one pen.

00:29.852 --> 00:31.744
They can change the world.

00:33.265 --> 00:35.787
My father only gave me the name Malala.

00:35.876 --> 00:37.263
He didn't make me Malala.

00:39.947 --> 00:42.840
I chose this life and now I must continue it.
