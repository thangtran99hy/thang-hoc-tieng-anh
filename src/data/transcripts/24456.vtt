00:00.050 --> 00:02.357
Every place has a secret code.

00:02.638 --> 00:03.953
I get a kick out of finding it.

00:04.293 --> 00:07.259
I'm Sonia Gil, and these are my travels.

00:12.449 --> 00:17.462
The Lower East Side is Manhattan's last frontier of cool.

00:18.894 --> 00:21.888
The promised land of old as well as new.

00:24.213 --> 00:26.175
Stand for a few minutes on any corner,...

00:26.375 --> 00:30.592
...and you'll see very different worlds coming together in the most beautiful way.

00:32.728 --> 00:38.339
Newcomers and old-timers, everyone's showing their different colors.

00:38.657 --> 00:41.494
And the streets, making them feel brand new.

00:49.199 --> 00:51.872
Different stories living side-by-side,...

00:56.045 --> 00:57.417
...moving on four wheels,...

00:59.018 --> 01:02.268
...playing soccer and football at the same time.

01:03.949 --> 01:09.076
This is where you walk around to feel the old and enjoy the new.
