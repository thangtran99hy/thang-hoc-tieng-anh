If there is a feeling that you are in the center of the world, this must be it.

00:07.220 --> 00:10.808
People visit from far away just to look up the buildings,...

00:11.013 --> 00:15.198
...gaze at the stores and stroll down the famous avenues.

00:15.706 --> 00:18.103
While many think of this place as a landmark,...

00:18.284 --> 00:23.553
...you can't forget that it is also one of Manhattan's most important neighborhoods.

00:24.629 --> 00:28.561
The vibe around here: think of the world's epicenter.

00:29.161 --> 00:31.943
Even the traffic police want in on the glamour.

00:32.515 --> 00:35.566
And that's the reason people actually live here.

00:35.903 --> 00:39.922
From billionaires to middle-class professionals in comfortable high-rises.

00:40.444 --> 00:45.828
From Fifth Avenue to Madison, it's all about finance, media, and retail.

00:48.191 --> 00:51.519
I wonder what it must feel like to live in the center of the universe.
