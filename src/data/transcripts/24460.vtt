This is the new Hero4 Session, and it's tiny.

00:03.697 --> 00:06.827
And it's completely waterproof without any special cases.

00:06.905 --> 00:10.554
This $400 camera measures only 1.5 inch cube.

00:10.925 --> 00:15.250
It's so small and so light that it can fit in places like under my penny board.

00:19.899 --> 00:21.067
Other GoPros cannot.

00:21.731 --> 00:25.616
To make it the easiest GoPro to use, there's only one main button on the camera.

00:26.122 --> 00:27.492
Press it once to start recording,...

00:27.797 --> 00:30.038
...and hold it down for three seconds to start a time lapse.

00:30.241 --> 00:34.453
Audio is also supposed to be clearer when the camera resurfaces from underwater.

00:34.659 --> 00:38.183
If there's one downside to the Session, it's the sealed battery.

00:38.569 --> 00:40.382
You can't swap it out if it dies.

00:40.726 --> 00:45.225
That said, the battery is good for two hours of video recording on a single charge.
