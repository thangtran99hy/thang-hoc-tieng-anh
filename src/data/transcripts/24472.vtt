We've all seen those doctor shows like Grey's Anatomy and Scrubs,...

00:05.346 --> 00:07.771
...but what is it really like to be a doctor?

00:08.185 --> 00:11.602
Today, I'm catching up with Dr. Tan, a local general practitioner,...

00:11.698 --> 00:14.921
...to find out what the reality of being a doctor is really like.

00:15.286 --> 00:15.701
Jesse.

00:15.957 --> 00:16.863
Dr. Tan.

00:16.977 --> 00:17.302
Hi.

00:20.749 --> 00:23.295
And so, as a GP, what's a typical day look like for you?

00:23.460 --> 00:25.030
Yeah, so it starts off in the morning.

00:25.237 --> 00:27.736
I come in, greet the staff, check my results,...

00:27.828 --> 00:30.865
...and to see if there's any urgent results that need action straightaway.

00:31.093 --> 00:32.858
And then I see the patients throughout the day,...

00:33.241 --> 00:36.157
...and deal with any walk-ins or any emergencies as they come along.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.315
And so, why did you wanna become a doctor?

00:38.540 --> 00:40.449
I really wanted to help patients and help people,...

00:40.563 --> 00:43.972
...and that's where I will find, being a doctor, you can help them the most.

00:44.518 --> 00:47.219
What characteristics does someone need to be a doctor?

00:47.527 --> 00:50.001
You need to be caring, show compassion,...

00:50.887 --> 00:54.160
...be a really good people's person and work hard at what you're doing.

00:54.685 --> 00:58.508
And so, from school to today, what does someone need to do to get to where you are?

00:58.685 --> 01:00.567
You have to really work hard in high school,...

01:00.876 --> 01:04.126
...do a bachelor's degree, do a postgraduate degree in medicine,...

01:04.507 --> 01:07.887
...and then spend a few years in the hospital as an intern, as a resident.

01:08.241 --> 01:10.477
And then you can apply to general practice,...

01:10.665 --> 01:13.441
...do three more years of training, before you can sit your exams...

01:13.532 --> 01:15.151
...and become a fully qualified GP.
