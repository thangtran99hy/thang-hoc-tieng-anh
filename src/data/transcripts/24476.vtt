To say Jordan Spieth gets it may be an understatement.

00:03.597 --> 00:05.578
But with two wins in his last two starts,...

00:05.716 --> 00:09.955
...it's safe to say the 21-year-old is clearly one of the game's future stars.

00:11.799 --> 00:15.615
Jordan is 39 under par in his last eight competitive rounds,...

00:16.007 --> 00:19.242
...including a final-round 63 to capture the Australian Open...

00:20.194 --> 00:23.731
...and a wire-to-wire 10-shot victory at the Hero World Challenge.

00:26.139 --> 00:29.929
The Texan hosted the inaugural Jordan Spieth Shootout and Charity concert,...

00:30.753 --> 00:34.986
...which helped raise awareness for his three key areas of philanthropic concern:...

00:36.007 --> 00:39.565
...junior golf, military families and special needs youths.

00:41.038 --> 00:45.511
The inspiration behind the foundation is Ellie Spieth, Jordan's younger sister.

00:47.145 --> 00:49.319
Ellie was born with neurological challenges...

00:49.462 --> 00:52.394
...and is a constant source of motivation for Jordan.

00:53.489 --> 00:55.243
I'm her biggest fan, she's my biggest fan.

00:55.893 --> 00:59.817
Mentally, she's learning to do new things and it really is something that's incredible...

00:59.923 --> 01:02.688
...and something that I wish a lot of people have the chance to experience.

01:02.787 --> 01:06.470
Maybe they can through this event and through the Spieth Family Foundation.

01:06.711 --> 01:10.037
Every time I step on the tee, I believe I have a chance to win that week.

01:10.649 --> 01:13.957
You gotta go in with utmost confidence in order to compete at PGA Tour...

01:14.081 --> 01:15.778
...and so I'd like to get a couple of wins...

01:16.196 --> 01:18.732
...and I think that that can happen and make it the best year yet.
