ï»¿An Italian artist is taking Easter to a whole new level...

00:05.743 --> 00:09.575
His canvas is open land and his brushes are tractors.

00:10.837 --> 00:15.951
For Holy Week, Dario Gambarin depicted a sacrificial lamb with the words "Happy Easter"...

00:16.277 --> 00:19.118
...out on a field near the Italian city of Verona.

00:19.753 --> 00:23.378
Covering a span of 27,000 square meters was no easy feat,...

00:23.808 --> 00:26.580
...but it's actually his area of expertise.

00:27.143 --> 00:32.291
Back in 2013, he also designed an image of Pope Francis shortly after his election,...

00:32.428 --> 00:34.495
...with the phrase "Love liberates."

00:35.057 --> 00:39.995
His list of designs also includes Nelson Mandela and even Barack Obama.

00:45.283 --> 00:46.812
To begin, I make a sketch.

00:47.017 --> 00:49.298
I try to find the essential lines of the face.

00:49.499 --> 00:52.353
It's as if I'm cutting a piece of cloth to place on a paper.

00:52.811 --> 00:56.799
Then I check out the feel on a tractor and try to find mental points of reference.

00:57.651 --> 01:00.323
It's a unique skill that few people can master.

01:00.650 --> 01:04.780
In fact, the only way he can check his work is through aerial photographs.

01:05.815 --> 01:08.012
He learned how to drive a tractor as a child.

01:08.359 --> 01:12.715
Now, he likes to combine his background with his unique, artistic skills.

01:13.293 --> 01:18.443
It's not your average work of art, but it's sure to catch people's attention.
