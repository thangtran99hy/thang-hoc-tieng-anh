He's known as one of the nicest guys in Hollywood,...

00:04.043 --> 00:06.423
...but Johnny Depp has excelled himself.

00:06.808 --> 00:10.603
The star donned his famous Jack Sparrow pirate costume in Australia...

00:10.915 --> 00:13.051
...to pay a visit to a children's hospital.

00:17.526 --> 00:18.049
Yes!

00:21.359 --> 00:24.603
Complete with the character's trademark dreadlocks and eyeliner...

00:24.920 --> 00:30.202
...and customary quirky British accent, Depp posed for selfies with beaming children.

00:31.441 --> 00:34.472
Now, if there's other people in it, why do you call it a selfie?

00:35.777 --> 00:39.025
He also recorded a special message for the patients.

00:39.455 --> 00:40.789
I've had a wonderful time.

00:41.221 --> 00:46.478
I've had a fantastic time meeting all the kids and everyone and the parents...

00:46.547 --> 00:47.806
...and the people and all that.

00:48.644 --> 00:50.231
And I stole a lot of things.

00:52.396 --> 00:59.409
And I want to salute you, all of you, for your bravery and your courage.
