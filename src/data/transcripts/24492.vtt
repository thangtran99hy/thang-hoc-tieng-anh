That's "peekaboo" in Japanese.

00:07.771 --> 00:08.747
How are you?

00:10.157 --> 00:11.466
This is my friend Jenna.

00:13.081 --> 00:14.908
Jenna's always going on crazy adventures...

00:14.985 --> 00:16.981
...and traveling places I wish I could go to.

00:17.313 --> 00:18.885
Travel is so important.

00:19.501 --> 00:20.888
It leaves you speechless,...

00:21.398 --> 00:22.989
...then makes you a storyteller.

00:23.466 --> 00:25.165
Wow, tell us a story.

00:25.262 --> 00:27.384
I took a picture with a donkey in Puerto Vallarta.

00:27.827 --> 00:28.772
So, what's your job?

00:29.211 --> 00:30.413
Professional nomad.

00:31.586 --> 00:32.627
Student of life.

00:32.692 --> 00:34.195
I got that from your Instagram.

00:34.291 --> 00:37.485
I think she means, what do you do that you can afford to travel so much?

00:37.630 --> 00:39.913
How can you afford not to?

00:40.494 --> 00:45.003
Travel is the one thing you buy that makes you richer.

00:45.154 --> 00:46.167
Her dad invented YouTube.

00:46.930 --> 00:48.967
Seriously, everyone should travel.

00:49.519 --> 00:50.551
I don't think I can.

00:50.669 --> 00:52.121
I have so many student loans.

00:52.257 --> 00:53.463
I'm poor.

00:53.592 --> 00:56.424
So was I, then I traveled.

00:56.753 --> 01:00.386
My boss says I can have two days off every week for my weekend.

01:01.536 --> 01:02.035
Where should I go?

01:02.453 --> 01:03.592
You have to go to Bali.

01:03.713 --> 01:06.213
Tickets are $1500 and 25 hours each way.

01:06.329 --> 01:11.362
The world is a book, and those who do not travel read but a page.

01:11.613 --> 01:12.189
You're right.

01:13.470 --> 01:14.039
I booked it!
