00:10.413 --> 00:11.713
Practical effects.

00:12.636 --> 00:16.106
You've been here, but you don't know this story.

00:17.134 --> 00:18.206
Nothing's changed, really.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.383
I mean, everything's changed, but nothing's changed.

00:21.183 --> 00:22.917
That's the way you want it to be, really,...

00:27.883 --> 00:30.841
...to think the way that technology has evolved...

00:31.108 --> 00:35.770
...and yet, keeping one foot in the pre-digital world.

00:39.714 --> 00:41.153

00:59.575 --> 01:00.316
I can die now.

01:03.380 --> 01:05.763
My whole life has led to this moment.

01:06.425 --> 01:07.167
I'm in heaven.
