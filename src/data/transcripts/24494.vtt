The one message that we're trying to get across is,...

00:13.120 --> 00:14.503
...as the oceans die, we die.

00:14.649 --> 00:18.233
So that's what we're trying to do: is make sure that the oceans don't die.

00:18.807 --> 00:24.342
You can take low-grade plastic debris and turn it into high-performance yarn.

00:24.613 --> 00:29.791
Bionic started out as a yarn that used recycled material.

00:29.990 --> 00:34.522
From bottle to chip, chip to fiber, fiber to yarn, yarn to Bionic.

00:35.217 --> 00:40.408
Bionic yarn and G-Star, we all happened to be very happy with each other.

00:40.513 --> 00:42.333
You know, we work alike.

00:43.065 --> 00:47.047
This is about moving things forward and going the next step beyond.

00:47.209 --> 00:49.561
You know, it's their intention.

00:49.673 --> 00:51.005
It's the DNA of the brand.

00:51.376 --> 00:53.704
Their intention and purpose has to make sense,...

00:54.131 --> 00:56.328
...and G-Star's does.
