00:06.276 --> 00:07.339
I am coral.

00:09.099 --> 00:10.926
Some people think I'm just a rock.

00:12.203 --> 00:15.168
When, in fact, I'm the largest thing alive on this planet.

00:17.599 --> 00:19.819
I'm so big, I can be seen from space.

00:21.859 --> 00:22.960
But for how long?

00:24.673 --> 00:27.752
I grew for almost 250 million years.

00:28.809 --> 00:31.945
And humans came along and now 1/5 of me is gone.

00:33.068 --> 00:35.777
Sure, I live at the bottom of the sea.

00:36.143 --> 00:37.914
And you might not see me that often.

00:38.987 --> 00:40.129
But you do need me.

00:42.085 --> 00:45.215
Do you realize that one quarter of all marine life depends on me?

00:46.477 --> 00:48.560
I am the nursery of the sea.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.575
Little fish depend on me for food.

00:52.283 --> 00:54.102
And to hide from the big fish.

00:55.091 --> 00:56.691
And guess who eats the big fish?

00:57.472 --> 00:59.385
That's right, you do.

00:59.753 --> 01:02.092
I'm the protein factory for the world.

01:03.017 --> 01:06.267
Yet you raise the temperature of the ocean so I can't live here anymore.

01:06.841 --> 01:10.887
And when big storms and tsunamis barrel through the ocean, I'm your fortress.

01:12.019 --> 01:15.837
Yet you tear me apart with dynamite and poison me with cyanide.

01:17.751 --> 01:22.935
Well, here's a crazy thought: Stop killing me.
