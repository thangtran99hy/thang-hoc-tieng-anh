00:03.799 --> 00:05.457
I am water.

00:07.104 --> 00:10.375
To humans, I am simply just there.

00:12.296 --> 00:14.451
I'm something they just take for granted.

00:17.300 --> 00:19.242
But there is only so much of me...

00:20.653 --> 00:23.505
...and more and more of them every single day.

00:26.223 --> 00:28.542
I start as rain in the mountains,...

00:29.432 --> 00:31.201
...flow to the rivers and streams,...

00:31.911 --> 00:33.281
...and end up in the ocean.

00:36.441 --> 00:38.667
Then the cycle begins again.

00:40.060 --> 00:44.391
And it will take me 10,000 years to get back to the state I'm in now.

00:47.317 --> 00:50.412
But to humans, I'm just water.

00:51.105 --> 00:51.939
Just there.

00:54.121 --> 00:58.337
Where will humans find me when there are billions more of them around?

00:59.137 --> 01:00.907
Where will they find themselves?

01:01.888 --> 01:04.000
Will they wage wars over me,...

01:04.614 --> 01:06.840
...like they do over everything else?

01:09.187 --> 01:10.673
That's always an option.

01:12.088 --> 01:14.314
But it's not the only option.
