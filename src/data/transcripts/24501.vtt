00:03.359 --> 00:05.073
I am a flower.

00:06.383 --> 00:08.325
Yes, I'm beautiful.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.018
I've heard it before.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.083
And it never grows old.

00:13.242 --> 00:18.426
I'm worshipped for my looks, my scent, my looks.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.255
But here's the thing.

00:21.134 --> 00:23.397
Life starts with me.

00:24.544 --> 00:26.305
You see, I feed people.

00:27.209 --> 00:28.923
Every fruit comes from me.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.573
Every potato, me.

00:31.817 --> 00:34.241
Every kernel of corn, me.

00:34.349 --> 00:37.002
Every grain of rice, me.

00:37.545 --> 00:40.472
Me, me, me, I know, but it's true.

00:41.812 --> 00:44.493
And sometimes I feed their souls.

00:45.484 --> 00:47.625
I am their words when they have none.

00:48.295 --> 00:50.776
I say "I love you" without a sound.

00:51.966 --> 00:54.163
"I'm sorry" without a voice.

00:56.026 --> 00:58.370
I inspire the greatest of them.

00:58.804 --> 01:03.989
Painters, poets, pattern makers, I've been a muse to them all.

01:05.909 --> 01:12.828
But in my experience, people underestimate the power of a pretty little flower.

01:15.287 --> 01:17.513
Because their life does start with me.

01:19.838 --> 01:21.950
And it could end without me.
