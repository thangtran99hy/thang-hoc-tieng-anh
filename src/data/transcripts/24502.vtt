00:03.808 --> 00:05.180
I am the ocean.

00:05.852 --> 00:07.110
I'm water.

00:07.567 --> 00:09.679
I'm most of this planet.

00:10.260 --> 00:11.803
I shaped it.

00:12.685 --> 00:16.788
Every stream, every cloud and every raindrop.

00:17.543 --> 00:20.622
It all comes back to me.

00:23.915 --> 00:30.237
One way or another, every living thing here needs me.

00:31.317 --> 00:32.751
I'm the source.

00:33.295 --> 00:35.521
I'm what they crawled out of.

00:37.675 --> 00:40.385
Humans? They're no different.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.267
I don't owe them a thing.

00:43.893 --> 00:46.403
I give; they take.

00:47.226 --> 00:49.509
But I can always take back.

00:51.691 --> 00:54.372
That's just the way it's always been.

00:55.029 --> 00:57.137
It's not their planet anyway.

00:57.577 --> 01:00.144
Never was, never will be.

01:01.304 --> 01:04.611
But humans, they take more than their share.

01:05.064 --> 01:08.087
They poison me then they expect me to feed them.

01:08.821 --> 01:10.421
Well, it doesn't work that way.

01:11.633 --> 01:18.711
If humans want to exist in nature with me and off of me, I suggest they listen close.

01:18.817 --> 01:21.101
I'm only gonna say this once.

01:22.353 --> 01:27.252
If nature isn't kept healthy, humans won't survive.

01:27.394 --> 01:28.653
Simple as that.

01:34.650 --> 01:36.227
That's all I have to say.
