A 14-time All-Star,...

...five-time Gold Glove Award winner,...

00:04.265 --> 00:06.369
...five-time Silver Slugger Award winner,...

00:06.819 --> 00:11.069
...the first player to win the All-Star Game MVP and World Series MVP...

00:11.429 --> 00:12.438
...in the same season,...

00:13.113 --> 00:15.102
...Derek is a five-time world champion...

00:15.481 --> 00:19.258
...and the face of the Yankees franchise for almost 20 years.

00:22.193 --> 00:23.778
I've had the greatest job in the world.

00:24.779 --> 00:27.416
I got a chance to be the shortstop for the New York Yankees...

00:27.866 --> 00:29.034
...and there's only one of those.

00:33.989 --> 00:36.020
And I always felt as though that my job...

00:37.041 --> 00:41.822
...was to try to provide joy and entertainment for you guys,...

00:42.545 --> 00:44.452
...but it can't compare to what you brought me.

00:45.510 --> 00:46.995
So, for that, thank you very much.

00:51.220 --> 00:52.424
I've loved what I've done.

00:53.049 --> 00:54.068
I loved what I do.

00:54.937 --> 00:56.925
More importantly, I've loved doing it for you.

00:57.027 --> 00:59.613
So, from the bottom of my heart, thank you very much.
