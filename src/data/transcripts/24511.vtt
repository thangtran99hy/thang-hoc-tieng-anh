I often make about 20 deliveries a day...

00:02.574 --> 00:04.173
...so it's crucial I can get around quickly...

00:04.254 --> 00:05.420
...and not get stuck in traffic.

00:06.145 --> 00:08.337
That's why we have yellow box junctions.

00:08.924 --> 00:13.097
The purpose of these are to keep road space free for road users like Anthony.

00:14.027 --> 00:17.232
So, how do you use a yellow box junction?

00:18.370 --> 00:21.305
You may enter a yellow box junction when your exit is clear...

00:21.739 --> 00:24.213
...and there is enough space on the other side of the junction...

00:24.324 --> 00:26.706
...for your vehicle to clear the box without stopping.

00:28.029 --> 00:31.032
You can only stop in a yellow box junction when turning right...

00:31.416 --> 00:33.999
...and are prevented from doing so by oncoming traffic...

00:34.585 --> 00:36.854
...or by other vehicles waiting to turn right.

00:37.867 --> 00:40.613
If your exit isn't clear and you're not turning right,...

00:40.955 --> 00:43.059
...no part of your vehicle should be in the box.

00:44.059 --> 00:47.051
Then, as soon as you're sure it's safe, you can proceed.

00:48.671 --> 00:51.259
Remember, blocking the yellow box junction...

00:51.391 --> 00:53.397
...means everyone else gets stuck with you.

00:55.581 --> 00:57.981
Yellow box junctions are here to keep the traffic flowing.

00:58.503 --> 01:00.749
If everyone did their bit and followed the simple rules,...

01:00.882 --> 01:02.494
...London would be an easier place to get around.
