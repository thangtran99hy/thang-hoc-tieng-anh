00:01.109 --> 00:02.177
She lives in Tokyo.

00:03.471 --> 00:04.513
He lives in Kyoto.

00:05.908 --> 00:06.939
She's a cab driver.

00:07.959 --> 00:08.933
He's a crab diver.

00:09.835 --> 00:12.800
Lately, she's been thinking she might be forever alone,...

00:13.355 --> 00:15.467
...and he feels as dull as a veneer floor.

00:15.886 --> 00:18.293
She longs to hear her ex's warm voice,...

00:18.881 --> 00:22.471
...whilst he stares at the microwave, remembering his ex's lasagna.

00:22.725 --> 00:24.325
She visits Dr. Koyshiro,...

00:24.906 --> 00:28.497
...he visits Dr. O'Yorkish, but nothing works.

00:29.592 --> 00:33.183
Until one day, her friend Dolly Dylan invites her to a costume party.

00:33.315 --> 00:36.622
Dolly is a friend of Lynda Lloyd, who in turn invites him.

00:36.862 --> 00:38.405
She dresses as an apple pie.

00:38.775 --> 00:40.603
He puts on a pineapple costume.

00:41.104 --> 00:43.329
And as she steps into that nasty old train,...

00:43.766 --> 00:46.617
...he drives miles down a tiny slant road.

00:47.093 --> 00:50.741
At the party, she walks away from a guy trying to negotiate moths.

00:51.576 --> 00:54.825
And bored as hell, he decides to get something to eat.

00:55.303 --> 00:57.585
And then they finally meet.

00:58.487 --> 01:02.760
Her name is Agostina, and his is Santiago.
