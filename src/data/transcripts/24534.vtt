Hey, mom.

00:00.800 --> 00:01.989
Good afternoon, Marissa.

00:02.141 --> 00:02.971
Do you have a minute?

00:03.190 --> 00:05.472
I'm here to assist you however I can.

00:05.605 --> 00:08.407
So, I'm seeing this guy and things are going really well,...

00:08.557 --> 00:11.779
...and then I texted him last night and he never wrote back.

00:12.083 --> 00:13.171
Should I text him again?

00:13.365 --> 00:14.794
Shall I text him for you?

00:15.171 --> 00:18.137
No. No, that would be totally weird.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.512
He mentioned something about a concert Friday night,...

00:20.752 --> 00:22.650
...but he hasn't actually invited me yet.

00:23.133 --> 00:24.575
Do you think I should make other plans?

00:24.710 --> 00:26.118
Let me check your calendar.

00:26.452 --> 00:29.675
At noon on Friday, you have a gynecologist appointment.

00:29.786 --> 00:30.876
Yeah, I know.

00:31.167 --> 00:32.239
The concert's at night.

00:32.630 --> 00:34.693
I've been dying to see Florence and the Machine again.

00:34.790 --> 00:36.366
They were so good last year.

00:36.449 --> 00:38.334
Okay, your washing machine is dying.

00:38.788 --> 00:42.599
The closest Sears Appliance Center is 0.5 miles away.

00:42.735 --> 00:45.221
What? Mom, why don't you ever listen to me?

00:45.347 --> 00:49.061
I'm really sorry about this, but I can't answer your question right now.

00:49.182 --> 00:51.510
I'm just having a bad day and you're not helping.

00:51.635 --> 00:54.458
I don't know what you mean by, "I'm having a bad day."

00:54.733 --> 00:56.050
Would you like me to search the web?

00:56.167 --> 00:58.109
Search the web for what?

00:58.356 --> 01:04.989
I found 9,544,110,700 entries for "what."
