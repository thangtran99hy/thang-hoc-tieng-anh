00:11.729 --> 00:13.105
This is for all the graduates.

00:13.249 --> 00:16.840
Whether if you're graduating from high school, college,...

00:17.099 --> 00:19.473
...talking with your mouth full, whatever, I don't know.

00:19.729 --> 00:22.011
Let's put on flat hats and dream!

00:22.159 --> 00:24.385
This sort of looks like a cat toy.

00:24.938 --> 00:25.912
Dream about life!

00:26.231 --> 00:27.403
Dream about what's next!

00:27.852 --> 00:30.700
Let's dream about a world where people get along!

00:30.941 --> 00:33.856
I mean, like, can't bass and treble be friends?

00:34.003 --> 00:35.517
I'm looking at you, Meghan Trainor!

00:35.716 --> 00:38.365
Life is like a really good sandwich.

00:38.603 --> 00:39.520
It's all in how you make it!

00:39.747 --> 00:41.859
So, fill it with the good stuff!

00:42.159 --> 00:43.985
Fill your life with the good stuff, people!

00:44.375 --> 00:47.209
We've been waiting for this moment and here we are.

00:47.639 --> 00:48.613
It's a good moment.

00:48.967 --> 00:50.753
All moments are if you take a moment.

00:51.360 --> 00:54.117
As I look out here today, I see potential.

00:54.270 --> 00:57.463
I see future surgeons and future teachers.

00:57.681 --> 00:58.809
Future Beyonces!

00:59.742 --> 01:01.968
I take that back; there's only one Beyonce.
