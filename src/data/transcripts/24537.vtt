Jessica Cox was born without arms due to a rare, nongenetic birth defect.

00:08.963 --> 00:13.980
But this hasn't held her back from driving a car, gaining a black belt in Taekwondo,...

00:15.445 --> 00:18.515
...playing the piano, scuba diving...

00:18.997 --> 00:22.350
...and becoming the world's first licensed armless pilot.

00:22.571 --> 00:28.663
Naturally, people saw the fact that I didn't have arms as a limiting factor.

00:28.841 --> 00:30.943
But I was there to prove them wrong.

00:31.474 --> 00:36.104
Now, she travels the world as a motivational speaker with her husband Patrick.

00:36.431 --> 00:38.896
If I had to describe Jessica in three words,...

00:39.029 --> 00:44.151
...it would be kind, positive and unstoppable.

00:46.244 --> 00:49.219
In 2008, her determination paid off...

00:49.590 --> 00:53.501
...when she became the first licensed armless pilot in the world.

00:53.953 --> 00:58.057
Three years, three different airplanes, three different flight instructors,...

00:58.256 --> 01:02.554
...80 hours of flying in three different states, I was a certified pilot.

01:02.804 --> 01:04.093
It was a long ordeal.
