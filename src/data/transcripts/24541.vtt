00:00.279 --> 00:02.286
She's clearly 24... 5?

00:02.802 --> 00:03.296
45.

00:03.825 --> 00:04.545
I can't tell anymore.

00:04.793 --> 00:07.597
I'm gonna go talk to her to prove to you guys how delusional you are.

00:09.701 --> 00:10.059
I'm sorry.

00:10.295 --> 00:11.047
Do you mind if I sit here?

00:12.743 --> 00:13.885
Yeah, be my guest.

00:16.121 --> 00:18.193
I'll put your service to the test.

00:18.554 --> 00:18.881
What?

00:19.402 --> 00:20.001
Beauty and the Beast?

00:20.630 --> 00:21.901
Oh, I've never seen it.

00:22.513 --> 00:25.059
My parents always said I was too mature for Disney movies.

00:27.680 --> 00:28.506
That's surprising.

00:29.143 --> 00:32.357
Yeah, I actually read the fairy tale before I ever even knew there was a movie.

00:34.341 --> 00:34.969
No way.

00:35.397 --> 00:36.427
I had a weird childhood.

00:37.801 --> 00:39.251
Oh, do you want some of my milk?

00:40.657 --> 00:41.354
You're drinking milk?

00:41.722 --> 00:46.475
Yeah, I have a bad calcium deficiency, which is also why sometimes I have to use this.

00:48.361 --> 00:49.013
What?

00:51.463 --> 00:52.523
Calcium supplements!

00:53.827 --> 00:55.728
It can get pretty painful sometimes.

00:56.028 --> 01:00.174
Like this year, for my 26th birthday, I had to be in a back brace.

01:02.046 --> 01:02.603
Thank God!

01:04.535 --> 01:08.742
Thank God for your fashion sense.

01:09.483 --> 01:13.508
You know, because you can probably wear whatever and still make it look good.

01:14.439 --> 01:14.855
Thank you.
