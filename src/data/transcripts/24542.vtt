Hi guys, this week on Uzoo,...

00:02.028 --> 00:04.613
...we'll be looking at the shocking story that has rocked the world this week:...

00:05.110 --> 00:08.150
...the killing of Cecil, Zimbabwe's most famous lion.

00:08.824 --> 00:11.675
Cecil was famous for his laid-back attitude towards humans.

00:12.070 --> 00:15.236
He'd often be seen walking near the roads, unfazed by tourists,...

00:15.535 --> 00:18.035
...giving them the opportunity to take some incredible photos.

00:18.867 --> 00:22.644
The hunter, Dr. Walter Palmer, is a dentist from Minnesota.

00:23.489 --> 00:26.222
He paid $50,000 for the right to hunt the lion,...

00:26.737 --> 00:28.823
...but claims he did not know that Cecil was protected...

00:29.131 --> 00:30.878
...and believed the hunt to be completely legal.

00:31.991 --> 00:35.318
Of course, this story is incredibly sad but it is not unheard of.
