00:04.297 --> 00:08.408
I'm going to tell you a story about a boy who would never grow up,...

00:09.801 --> 00:11.615
...about the pirate who wished to catch him,...

00:13.326 --> 00:15.443
...about the island where fairies roamed.

00:17.558 --> 00:19.594
But this isn't the story you've heard before.

00:20.587 --> 00:26.111
Because sometimes friends begin as enemies, and enemies begin as friends.

00:27.687 --> 00:33.185
Sometimes to truly understand how things end, we must first know how they begin.

00:35.477 --> 00:39.185
Welcome to Neverland!

00:41.811 --> 00:45.749
It was written, when you return you'd unite our people against the pirates.

00:47.661 --> 00:48.487
Mind if I cut in?

00:49.945 --> 00:51.849
What if I fail to fulfill the prophecy?

00:51.953 --> 00:53.277
And what if you fail to try?

00:54.571 --> 00:56.804
If you don't believe, Peter, then neither will they.

00:57.663 --> 01:00.573
You can't stay a kid forever even in Neverland.

01:01.181 --> 01:02.659
Wakey-wakey!

01:07.595 --> 01:08.291
Now, kneel.

01:08.433 --> 01:09.691
I will never bow to you.

01:11.926 --> 01:13.130
Do you know how to work a ship?

01:13.215 --> 01:14.232
How hard can it be?

01:17.481 --> 01:19.390
This is a lot harder than it looks!

01:20.382 --> 01:21.905
We're sailing now!
