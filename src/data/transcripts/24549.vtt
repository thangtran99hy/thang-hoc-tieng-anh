Parents are the most important thing.

00:05.341 --> 00:07.049
I don't know how she thinks she's doing as a mother,...

00:07.137 --> 00:12.377
...but sometimes you just don't really know the right words to say.

00:20.286 --> 00:21.147
Dear mom,...

00:21.492 --> 00:24.055
I often forget to tell you how much you mean to me.

00:24.277 --> 00:26.310
You always taught me to stay positive,...

00:27.493 --> 00:31.137
...even when it feels like the world has fallen down around me.

00:33.673 --> 00:35.817
I never really told you how much you mean to me.

00:35.941 --> 00:38.462
And that's because there aren't words powerful enough...

00:38.936 --> 00:40.991
...to describe how much you mean to me.

00:42.819 --> 00:44.834
I admire your strength and courage.

00:45.139 --> 00:46.455
I love you so much.

00:46.866 --> 00:47.669
Love, Claire.
