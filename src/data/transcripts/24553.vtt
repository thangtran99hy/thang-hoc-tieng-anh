00:08.560 --> 00:11.971
Imagine, these kids won't have to remember passwords,...

00:13.166 --> 00:14.730
...or obsess about security.

00:15.854 --> 00:18.429
For them, every screen is meant to be touched,...

00:19.311 --> 00:22.555
...and Web pages are meant to be scribbled on and shared.

00:23.497 --> 00:25.436
They'll expect their devices to listen to them.

00:26.373 --> 00:27.063
And talk.

00:27.552 --> 00:29.760
And sing, tell a funny joke.

00:31.038 --> 00:35.223
And as they grow and get better at things, their technology will too.

00:36.903 --> 00:39.238
They'll do things their parents never even dreamed of.

00:41.061 --> 00:44.031
Because these kids will grow up with Windows 10.

00:46.075 --> 00:49.512
The future starts now, for all of us.

00:51.437 --> 00:52.463
Get started today.

00:55.125 --> 00:55.972
Windows 10.

00:56.618 --> 00:58.067
A more human way to do.
