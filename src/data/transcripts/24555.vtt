One of my biggest revenue generators is my clothing line.

00:06.461 --> 00:10.093
And it wasn't until my followers on Facebook, actually...

00:10.176 --> 00:11.525
...this was like, three years ago,...

00:11.823 --> 00:13.869
...they asked me if I could make a t-shirt for them.

00:13.970 --> 00:17.539
And it was only then that I actually went out to Forever 21,...

00:17.637 --> 00:21.078
...bought some blank t-shirts, made a design on Adobe Illustrator,...

00:21.185 --> 00:24.967
...got it locally printed and sold my first 20 or 30 shirts.

00:25.338 --> 00:26.405
And then they asked for more.

00:26.509 --> 00:31.036
So, interestingly enough, even though I've always wanted to be a fashion designer and everything,...

00:31.195 --> 00:36.169
...the idea of merging fashion with Blogilates and fitness came from my fans.

00:36.262 --> 00:37.976
As long as my ears are open,...

00:38.167 --> 00:42.115
...and I'm open to changing and creating new things for them constantly,...

00:42.208 --> 00:43.694
...then it's a beautiful relationship.
