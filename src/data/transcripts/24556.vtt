There's a lot of rumors about the Apple logo and why the company is named Apple.

00:05.501 --> 00:07.373
For example, a popular misconception...

00:07.477 --> 00:11.983
...is that the logo is a representation of the forbidden fruit mentioned in the Bible.

00:12.156 --> 00:15.525
The truth, however, is far more unexceptional.

00:15.810 --> 00:18.231
Both Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak have said...

00:18.316 --> 00:22.189
...that the name Apple was randomly chosen because of its simplicity,...

00:22.386 --> 00:24.897
...and as they couldn't come up with a better name.

00:25.058 --> 00:27.906
At the time, personal computers were not that common,...

00:28.017 --> 00:33.352
...so they wanted a name that was easy to understand and not intimidating to the average person.

00:33.587 --> 00:36.449
The logo was also chosen because of its simplicity.

00:36.607 --> 00:37.722
At the very beginning though,...

00:37.837 --> 00:41.881
...they actually used a logo featuring Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree,...

00:42.091 --> 00:46.079
...but this was changed because it would be unrecognizable in small print.

00:46.424 --> 00:48.494
When they changed the logo to the current design,...

00:48.580 --> 00:51.659
...they considered using a logo with or without the bite,...

00:51.837 --> 00:54.229
...but, in the end, the logo with the bite was chosen...

00:54.328 --> 00:57.663
...to make smaller versions indistinguishable from a cherry.
