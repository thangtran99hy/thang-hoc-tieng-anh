Apple Computer was established in 1976 by Ronald Wayne, Steve Wozniak, and Steve Jobs.

00:07.095 --> 00:13.247
After only two weeks, Wayne left the company and sold his 10% stock for $800.

00:13.477 --> 00:18.946
If he'd kept those 10% to this day, it would be worth over 60 billion.

00:19.244 --> 00:23.062
A few months after Wayne's departure, Apple released the Apple I.

00:23.337 --> 00:27.491
Steve Wozniak developed and designed both the hardware and operating system.

00:27.678 --> 00:30.559
In fact, the Apple I was the first time in history...

00:30.655 --> 00:34.891
...that a character displayed on a TV screen was generated by a home computer.

00:35.067 --> 00:38.487
Only a year later, Wozniak developed the Apple II,...

00:38.672 --> 00:40.738
...the first PC with color.

00:40.959 --> 00:44.092
In 1984, Apple launched the first Macintosh.

00:44.261 --> 00:47.341
In 1985, something interesting happened.

00:47.458 --> 00:51.767
A power struggle developed between Jobs and then CEO John Sculley.

00:51.873 --> 00:56.333
As a result of this, Apple's board of directors removed Jobs from his management duties,...

00:56.543 --> 01:00.219
...which in turn led to his resignation from the company the same year.
