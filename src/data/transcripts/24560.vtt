If your website isn't mobile-friendly, prepare to see your Google Search rankings plummet.

00:05.121 --> 00:07.345
It's being called "Mobilegeddon."

00:07.499 --> 00:10.514
Google is tweaking its search results to give preference to sites...

00:10.651 --> 00:12.590
...optimized for mobile devices.

00:12.809 --> 00:15.818
Okay, so Mobilegeddon is a little dramatic,...

00:15.907 --> 00:19.483
...but the changes will certainly put some businesses at a disadvantage,...

00:19.599 --> 00:23.781
...specifically small and medium-size businesses that don't have the same tech resources...

00:24.042 --> 00:25.421
...that huge companies have.

00:25.529 --> 00:27.811
So now, the local mom-and-pop diner is...

00:27.874 --> 00:31.309
...even more likely to rank behind major chains in search results.

00:31.621 --> 00:34.233
And it's not just the little guys taking a hit here.

00:34.537 --> 00:37.841
Sites for the European Union, BBC and even Wikipedia,...

00:38.065 --> 00:40.936
...all rank low on Google's Mobile-Friendly Test.

00:41.166 --> 00:44.686
The test accounts for things like text size, amount of space between links...

00:44.939 --> 00:47.705
...and how the content displays on small screens.

00:47.901 --> 00:50.486
Google says it's simply adapting to the times.

00:50.595 --> 00:55.009
A 2014 study found that in the US, mobile devices account for 60%...

00:55.099 --> 00:56.703
...of time spent on digital media.

00:56.900 --> 01:01.018
But the changes are certainly bad news for sites not optimized for mobile.

01:01.187 --> 01:03.669
Research by online advertising analyst Jatika...

01:03.748 --> 01:05.927
...shows that the first result in the Google search...

01:06.253 --> 01:10.003
...gets almost a third of the traffic share and if a site doesn't rank in the top 10,...

01:10.242 --> 01:13.907
...then it can pretty much kiss any help for traffic from the search engine goodbye.
