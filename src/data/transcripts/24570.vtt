ï»¿If you get caught in the middle of a big, open field during a lightning storm,...

00:03.845 --> 00:06.911
...which of the following uniforms would be most likely to keep you safe?

00:07.299 --> 00:12.388
A thick wet suit, a superman costume, a medieval coat of armor or your birthday suit?

00:12.745 --> 00:16.047
If you answered "medieval coat of armor," you might be a little crazy,...

00:16.306 --> 00:17.599
...but you'd also be right.

00:18.019 --> 00:21.253
You'd be crazy, of course, because lightning is much more likely to strike metal...

00:21.351 --> 00:22.978
...than rubber, fabric or bare skin.

00:23.434 --> 00:27.392
The reason is that lightning bolts are just long streams of fast-flowing electrons...

00:27.495 --> 00:30.244
...looking for the easiest path from point A to point B,...

00:30.530 --> 00:33.969
...and no everyday material provides an easier path than metal.

00:34.511 --> 00:38.277
So why would a material that lures lightning bolts keep you safe during a thunderstorm?

00:38.611 --> 00:42.229
Ironically, for the exact same reason it attracts the lightning in the first place.

00:42.495 --> 00:44.735
Metal is a great conductor of electricity.

00:45.039 --> 00:49.315
Electrons glide so easily over metals that they barely penetrate into the surface.

00:49.745 --> 00:53.190
And if an electrical current happens to be moving over a hollow metal container,...

00:53.380 --> 00:56.055
...like a can or a box or even a welded coat of armor,...

00:56.294 --> 00:58.441
...the current won't reach the inside of the container.

00:58.613 --> 01:01.880
But actually, the real best thing to do is avoid lightning altogether,...

01:02.021 --> 01:04.861
...and head indoors when you spot a storm on the horizon.
