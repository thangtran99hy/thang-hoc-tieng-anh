00:00.015 --> 00:01.049
Here comes Lauren.

00:01.295 --> 00:02.161
Lauren works here.

00:02.260 --> 00:03.615
Always turn on the Nylon sign.

00:03.703 --> 00:04.053
Okay.

00:04.203 --> 00:06.003
Make sure that the newest issue is out.

00:06.198 --> 00:06.574
Right.

00:06.725 --> 00:09.313
And make sure that you are constantly smiling.

00:09.417 --> 00:10.288
It's gonna be rough.

00:12.056 --> 00:12.359
Hi.

00:12.852 --> 00:13.497
Hey!

00:13.986 --> 00:15.903
Hey, I have a meeting with Marissa.

00:16.384 --> 00:17.937
Marissa, yes I will...

00:18.555 --> 00:19.697
Take a seat.

00:20.263 --> 00:21.485
Dan, I've not said hi.

00:21.559 --> 00:21.848
Dan?

00:22.007 --> 00:22.358
Yeah.

00:22.463 --> 00:22.896
Are you new?

00:22.993 --> 00:23.682
I'm very new.

00:24.453 --> 00:26.975
I'm running late anyway, so I guess it's technically my fault.

00:27.954 --> 00:28.954
She's not picking up, Joe.

00:29.058 --> 00:29.683
I'm sorry, mate.

00:29.803 --> 00:31.300
I mean, I have a meeting, you know.

00:31.574 --> 00:32.567
One moment.

00:32.643 --> 00:33.180
Can you go find her?

00:33.300 --> 00:33.531
Yeah.

00:33.739 --> 00:34.031
Okay.

00:35.829 --> 00:37.247
This new guy sucks.
