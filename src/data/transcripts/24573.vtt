00:08.845 --> 00:09.409
Where?

00:09.911 --> 00:12.519
Let's just say I put them in a hole and threw away the hole.

00:15.231 --> 00:18.482
There's rumors, Amanda, that some of them have abilities.

00:18.620 --> 00:19.558
Oh yeah.

00:19.711 --> 00:21.385
I have seen things.

00:22.027 --> 00:26.111
Maybe Superman was some kind of beacon for them to creep back from the shadows.

00:27.675 --> 00:30.903
I want to assemble a task force of the most dangerous people on the planet...

00:31.895 --> 00:33.191
...who I think can do some good.

00:34.923 --> 00:35.764
They're bad guys?

00:36.136 --> 00:36.641
Exactly.

00:37.598 --> 00:40.774
And if anything goes wrong, we blame them. We have built-in deniability.

00:41.744 --> 00:43.249
What makes you think you can control them?

00:44.014 --> 00:46.679
Because getting people to act against their own self-interest...

00:46.761 --> 00:47.904
...is what I do for a living.

00:51.726 --> 00:53.682
All you need to know is you work for me.

01:03.832 --> 01:05.119
So, that's it, huh?

01:05.657 --> 01:06.891
We're the patsies.

01:08.301 --> 01:10.307
We're some kind of suicide squad.

01:12.149 --> 01:13.217
Let's go save the world.

01:18.005 --> 01:19.407
Oh, I'm not gonna kill you.

01:28.276 --> 01:29.768
I'm just gonna hurt you...

01:30.649 --> 01:33.890
...really, really bad.
