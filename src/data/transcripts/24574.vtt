00:00.855 --> 00:02.583
My dear Miss Everdeen.

00:04.962 --> 00:06.091
Make no mistake,...

00:07.572 --> 00:09.416
...the game is coming to its end.

00:13.101 --> 00:14.814
Snow has to pay for what he's done.

00:18.799 --> 00:20.363
Our lives were never ours.

00:22.058 --> 00:24.005
They belong to Snow and our deaths do, too.

00:26.237 --> 00:27.805
But if you kill him, Katniss,...

00:29.845 --> 00:31.161
...if you end all of this,...

00:32.727 --> 00:33.717
...all those deaths,...

00:37.085 --> 00:38.035
...they mean something.

00:42.118 --> 00:50.547
Tonight, turn your weapons to The Capitol.

00:53.635 --> 01:00.749
Turn your weapons to Snow.
