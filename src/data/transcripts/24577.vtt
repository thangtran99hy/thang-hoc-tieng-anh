One of the most notable differences between the two accents is the way we pronounce the letter R.

00:05.597 --> 00:11.920
In America, most of us pronounce the R in words like hard, card, ever, water, and dare,...

00:12.205 --> 00:16.137
...but Brits say, "hard, card, ever, water, and dare".

00:16.491 --> 00:20.537
This is the difference between what's called "rhotic" and "non-rhotic" speech.

00:20.711 --> 00:25.249
The interesting thing is that the first British that came to America did pronounce their Rs...

00:25.339 --> 00:28.316
...and it wasn't until later in Britain, around 1800,...

00:28.451 --> 00:33.106
...that the non-rhotic speech became popular among the upper classes in the south of England...

00:33.259 --> 00:37.115
...and eventually became the pronunciation that was taught in schools.

00:37.537 --> 00:43.190
Of course, there are some accents in the UK like those of Ireland and Scotland, which are rhotic,...

00:43.427 --> 00:48.959
...and there are those in America, like in Boston, "pack your car, Harvard yard" for example,...

00:49.282 --> 00:52.517
...and in the south that are non-rhotic and don't pronounce the R.

00:52.922 --> 00:54.361
So the interesting thing here is that...

00:54.551 --> 01:00.168
...the Brits may have more to do with the difference in accents than the Americans do.

01:00.583 --> 01:02.486
In other words, it's not our fault.
