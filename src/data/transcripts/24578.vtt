00:07.507 --> 00:08.481
Act tough.

00:09.783 --> 00:10.871
Be a man...

00:13.348 --> 00:15.568
Well I don't know what you mean by that.

00:16.008 --> 00:16.925
Unafraid.

00:17.461 --> 00:18.322
Courage.

00:18.660 --> 00:22.173
I feel it's kind of sexist when someone just says, "Be a man."

00:22.337 --> 00:23.881
Well, there's strong women as well.

00:24.720 --> 00:25.183
Strong.

00:26.357 --> 00:27.056
Stupid.

00:27.272 --> 00:28.957
It's almost a sexist phrase, too...

00:29.134 --> 00:34.631
...like if you're not being a man, it's kind of saying you're being a woman in a way too.

00:35.047 --> 00:36.305
Take responsibility.

00:37.467 --> 00:38.310
Sexist.

00:38.785 --> 00:40.877
It's a very accepted form of sexism.

00:41.078 --> 00:45.181
To be the man, it implies that you need to be something specific.

00:46.193 --> 00:46.826
Silly.

00:48.153 --> 00:49.363
Relative.

00:50.050 --> 00:50.853
Honest.

00:52.439 --> 00:55.792
Being true to yourself and your surroundings, the people you work with,...

00:56.292 --> 00:58.149
...the people you live with, the people you love.

00:58.925 --> 01:00.298
Trust your instincts.

01:01.903 --> 01:08.907
Be strong, don't let people push you around and be kind to women.
