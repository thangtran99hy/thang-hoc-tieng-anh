Remember back in school,...

00:02.290 --> 00:05.653
...when you either invited the new kid over to your table or you didn't?

00:06.723 --> 00:08.779
If you did, that was a cool move.

00:09.838 --> 00:10.983
That was an "and" move.

00:11.467 --> 00:14.603
"And" moves take guts, but they can mean everything.

00:15.335 --> 00:17.390
Their "and" move was to put wings on a bicycle.

00:17.874 --> 00:19.075
Now, we fly.

00:19.914 --> 00:24.359
When enough people have an "and" view, the world changes forever.

00:25.535 --> 00:28.613
If you think about it, you're only here because of an "and" moment.

00:29.383 --> 00:33.287
Opening yourself up isn't easy, but when you do, it's hard to forget...

00:33.829 --> 00:36.339
...because it leads to something new, something better.

00:37.265 --> 00:42.391
That's why we need this and this and them and you.

00:43.077 --> 00:45.061
Yeah, you, watching this right now.

00:45.492 --> 00:47.775
Because everyone doing the same thing won't move us forward,...

00:48.316 --> 00:53.329
...but everyone doing their own thing, together, can.
