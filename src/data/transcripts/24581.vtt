00:00.059 --> 00:02.526
Three, two, one!

00:02.822 --> 00:03.305
Date!

00:03.708 --> 00:04.619
So Julie...

00:04.748 --> 00:05.332
Julia.

00:05.428 --> 00:05.861
Julia!

00:06.135 --> 00:06.523
So!

00:06.756 --> 00:07.124
So...

00:08.638 --> 00:09.313
How do you do?

00:09.745 --> 00:11.515
I'm super nervous.

00:11.651 --> 00:12.723
I don't know, I've never done it before.

00:13.512 --> 00:15.145
Hmm... Someone's dressed up fancy.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.429
Ask him to steal pretzels from another table.

00:18.514 --> 00:19.716
Their pretzels are way better than ours.

00:19.805 --> 00:20.473
Can you steal me one?

00:20.574 --> 00:21.532
You want me to steal you a pretzel?

00:24.839 --> 00:28.371
Pretend your date's eyes are the most interesting things you've ever seen.

00:28.575 --> 00:30.921
Wow, I can see the universe in there.

00:33.274 --> 00:35.957
Put some pretzels up your nose and snort.

00:36.028 --> 00:36.567
Do you ever do the walrus?

00:37.372 --> 00:37.572
No!

00:38.137 --> 00:38.479
Double that.

00:38.789 --> 00:38.987
There.

00:42.352 --> 00:43.408
Bark like a dog now.

00:45.995 --> 00:47.990
Try to make the whole room bark like a dog.

00:53.638 --> 00:55.770
Today's dating was with a bit of a twist.

00:56.993 --> 00:57.726
Hey guys!

01:00.589 --> 01:02.318
You guys are awesome!
