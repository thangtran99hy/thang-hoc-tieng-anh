ï»¿Hannah's in trouble.

00:02.888 --> 00:04.881
She's locked in this house and her dad is a psychopath.

00:06.199 --> 00:06.873
Does she have a friend?

00:07.534 --> 00:09.061
The abominable snowman of Pasadena.

00:09.294 --> 00:10.860
These are all Goosebumps manuscripts.

00:10.993 --> 00:12.291
Why are these books locked?

00:13.997 --> 00:15.050
Did you unlock a book?

00:15.213 --> 00:15.549
Oh no.

00:15.701 --> 00:16.095
I'm sorry.

00:16.167 --> 00:17.016
I'll put it back where it belongs.

00:17.087 --> 00:17.532
Look, here it is.

00:17.605 --> 00:18.273
No, don't open it!

00:29.649 --> 00:31.946
Nobody make a sound.

00:36.175 --> 00:37.187
Goosebumps.

00:39.105 --> 00:39.771
Gnomes?

00:41.583 --> 00:42.567
Maybe they're friendly.

00:44.244 --> 00:44.834
Not friendly.

00:45.305 --> 00:46.429
Definitely not friendly!
