Panama City really is the most modern capital in all of Central America.

00:04.772 --> 00:06.889
The best way to see Panama City is by foot.

00:07.284 --> 00:07.884
And walking around,...

00:07.953 --> 00:11.073
...you certainly get to see what a vibrant metropolis the capital is.

00:11.698 --> 00:13.788
People come to Panama City to see the canal,...

00:13.865 --> 00:15.859
...but there's so much more to be found here.

00:16.756 --> 00:18.898
The gorgeous architecture of the old town...

00:18.979 --> 00:21.963
...is in stark contrast with the Miami-esque skyline,...

00:22.312 --> 00:25.885
...the perfect combination of old world charm and new world style.
