Lonely Planet presents: How to Survive Small Talk.

00:04.645 --> 00:06.168
Small talk should be small.

00:06.496 --> 00:08.494
Keep your topics light and your pace brisk.

00:08.841 --> 00:11.295
Have engaging answers ready for generic questions.

00:11.477 --> 00:15.238
For example, "How's work?" should be a springboard for a delightful anecdote.

00:15.429 --> 00:18.281
A simple, "Work's good." simply won't suffice.

00:18.582 --> 00:21.547
Monosyllabic responses didn't serve you well as a teenager,...

00:21.899 --> 00:23.635
...and it certainly won't stand as an adult.

00:24.155 --> 00:27.479
Unless you already know the answer to a question, don't ask it.

00:27.683 --> 00:30.079
"How's your boyfriend?" might seem like a great opener...

00:30.313 --> 00:32.880
...until you realize he ran off with the pool boy.

00:33.347 --> 00:37.678
"Catch me up!" or "What's new?" are less likely to lead you to a conversational cul-de-sac.

00:38.325 --> 00:41.783
Lastly,  you can master all this and become a small talk superstar,...

00:41.909 --> 00:43.402
...but you can't make people talk to you.

00:43.950 --> 00:47.022
If you get no response, cut your losses and head to the bar.
