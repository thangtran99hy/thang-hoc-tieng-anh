00:00.174 --> 00:03.253
There are two things in this world that I'm the best at,...

00:03.614 --> 00:07.859
...being a professional barista and being an unlicensed therapist.

00:08.313 --> 00:11.563
If I can do them at the same time, why wouldn't I?

00:12.375 --> 00:15.902
I do things that real therapists can't.

00:16.119 --> 00:17.735
I'm too old for this stool.

00:18.035 --> 00:19.223
Get me out of here!

00:19.353 --> 00:20.576
Get me out of here!

00:22.449 --> 00:22.859
You're welcome.

00:23.540 --> 00:27.472
I listen with my eyes, and I heal with my hands.

00:27.720 --> 00:32.335
They come for the brownies, but they stay because there are pills in them.

00:33.369 --> 00:34.343
Secret recipe.

00:34.951 --> 00:36.323
I love my job.

00:36.797 --> 00:39.933
I get to be a therapist without all the boring parts.

00:40.445 --> 00:42.650
Pouring coffee is beneath me.

00:43.519 --> 00:44.950
I have a higher calling.

00:45.466 --> 00:48.241
Have you heard about the healing powers of shock therapy?

00:48.329 --> 00:49.087
No, what's it about?

00:50.219 --> 00:54.037
I'm the baristapist, and you don't need a license for that...

00:54.727 --> 00:56.185
...except for the one that I embroider.
