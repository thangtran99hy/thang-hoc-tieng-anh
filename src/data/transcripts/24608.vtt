Mr. Trump's language is divisive.

00:04.163 --> 00:04.706
I want to win.

00:05.008 --> 00:07.920
I want one of these people here or the ones at 5 o'clock,...

00:08.001 --> 00:09.608
...to be the next president of the United States.

00:09.911 --> 00:11.920
I've had my issues with Donald Trump.

00:15.799 --> 00:20.397
You've called women you don't like "fat pigs," "dogs," "slobs,"...

00:20.795 --> 00:22.088
...and "disgusting animals."

00:22.967 --> 00:23.731
Your Twitter account...

00:23.799 --> 00:25.245
Only Rosie O'Donnell.

00:27.257 --> 00:28.041
No, it wasn't.

00:28.265 --> 00:31.512
Lenders to your companies lost billions of dollars.

00:32.476 --> 00:37.447
Question sir, with that record, why should we trust you to run the nation's business?

00:37.761 --> 00:39.808
I have never gone bankrupt, by the way.

00:39.904 --> 00:40.637
I have never.

00:42.133 --> 00:47.147
We need to build a wall and it has to be built quickly.

00:47.445 --> 00:51.045
And I don't mind having a big beautiful door in that wall...

00:51.139 --> 00:54.717
...so that people can come into this country legally.
