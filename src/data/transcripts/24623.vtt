Dear depression, we go way back.

00:04.617 --> 00:06.693
I remember the first time I met you.

00:07.081 --> 00:10.775
I was seven years old, a pigtailed lover of books,...

00:11.154 --> 00:14.176
...teased for the sneakers my mother could barely afford.

00:14.981 --> 00:17.690
When I was sad for the 49th day in a row,...

00:18.171 --> 00:21.535
...I begged you to go away, but you would not leave.

00:22.531 --> 00:25.753
You, depression, are my childhood friend.

00:26.190 --> 00:29.437
The midnight voices in my head, a slick tongue.

00:29.761 --> 00:33.650
You pretend to have the answers, but loving you got me sick.

00:33.792 --> 00:37.155
But dare yourself, extraordinary human,...

00:37.313 --> 00:41.929
...to run into joy screaming, "You cannot have me."

00:42.235 --> 00:44.152
You cannot have me.

00:44.468 --> 00:45.918
I am not my past.

00:46.097 --> 00:48.313
I am worthy of love, I am worthy.

00:48.627 --> 00:53.512
I am forgiving myself for not being strong enough to believe in myself.

00:53.854 --> 00:57.103
I can tell you, I do not know who my father is,...

00:57.370 --> 01:00.250
...but I would rather tell you I am letting go.

01:00.534 --> 01:02.248
I am letting failure go.

01:02.495 --> 01:04.323
I am letting loneliness go.

01:04.633 --> 01:06.005
I will not give up.

01:06.285 --> 01:07.847
You will not silence me.

01:08.299 --> 01:10.695
Sincerely, Tanya.
