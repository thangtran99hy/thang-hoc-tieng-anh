Today we're eating very fancy.

00:02.957 --> 00:04.577
We're at a Michelin star restaurant,...

00:04.738 --> 00:08.272
...but actually it's the cheapest Michelin star restaurant in the world.

00:08.435 --> 00:09.991
We're at Tim Ho Wan.

00:10.422 --> 00:13.627
Specialties here are pork buns that are baked.

00:13.875 --> 00:15.873
I think they're quite crispy on the outside.

00:16.301 --> 00:19.112
All the dishes are about two dollars, three dollars.

00:19.288 --> 00:23.191
We've got about 11 dishes coming up, and we're really excited.

00:23.679 --> 00:26.717
So these are the world-famous baked pork buns.

00:27.026 --> 00:31.540
It's a Cha Siu Bao but I think they baked it, and it looks amazing.

00:31.652 --> 00:32.449
I'm gonna give this a try.

00:35.440 --> 00:36.073
Oh, wow.

00:39.980 --> 00:43.969
It's like, the pastry is really nice and sweet, it's crumbly,...

00:45.303 --> 00:46.704
...and the inside is delicious.

00:47.604 --> 00:48.039
Look at that.

00:51.740 --> 00:54.817
It's like glazed pork. Yum!
