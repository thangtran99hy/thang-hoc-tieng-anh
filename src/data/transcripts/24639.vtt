Reverend Pinckney once said, "Across the South, we have a deep appreciation of history."

00:09.801 --> 00:12.744
"We haven't always had a deep appreciation of each other's history."

00:23.293 --> 00:25.785
What is true in the South is true for America.

00:28.320 --> 00:36.672
Clem understood that justice grows out of recognition of ourselves in each other.

00:38.877 --> 00:42.482
That my liberty depends on you being free, too.

00:46.217 --> 00:55.333
That history can't be a sword to justify injustice, or a shield against progress,...

00:57.469 --> 01:01.448
...but must be a manual for how to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.

01:02.906 --> 01:04.169
How to break the cycle.

01:05.252 --> 01:08.507
A roadway toward a better world.

01:11.399 --> 01:17.135
He knew that the path of grace involves an open mind...

01:19.070 --> 01:20.693
...but, more importantly, an open heart.

01:24.314 --> 01:27.731
That's what I've felt this week: an open heart.

01:30.479 --> 01:34.409
That, more than any particular policy or analysis,...

01:35.963 --> 01:37.898
...is what's called upon right now, I think.
