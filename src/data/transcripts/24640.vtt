00:00.901 --> 00:02.970
Just three feet of added sea level...

00:03.087 --> 00:06.897
...will eliminate up to 14,000 square feet of the Indian subcontinent.

00:07.231 --> 00:10.928
So a rise of 70 times that would be disastrous for the region.

00:12.014 --> 00:16.339
Mumbai and Calcutta would be underwater along with the entire country of Bangladesh,...

00:16.606 --> 00:18.570
...which is home to 160 million people.

00:20.642 --> 00:24.253
The coast of Southeast Asia and the surrounding islands will be pushed inland,...

00:24.809 --> 00:29.445
...drowning Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Singapore, Manila and Hong Kong.

00:30.366 --> 00:34.478
Land that's currently home to 600 million Chinese would disappear underwater,...

00:34.835 --> 00:36.777
...wiping out Shanghai and Beijing.

00:37.603 --> 00:41.645
Sea level in Japan will rise 10 to 20% faster than the global average.

00:42.413 --> 00:43.690
After all is said and done,...

00:43.925 --> 00:46.806
...hundreds of millions of people will be forced to retreat inland,...

00:47.099 --> 00:50.255
...leaving behind the continent's largest and most prosperous cities...

00:50.668 --> 00:51.927
...to be buried by the ocean.
