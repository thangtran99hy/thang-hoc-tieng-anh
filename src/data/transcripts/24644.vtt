ï»¿Selfies are beautiful.

00:03.165 --> 00:05.549
Who hasn't been thrilled by the self photographer?

00:05.771 --> 00:10.619
Those fabulous narc-artists who allow us to bask in the brightness of their shine.

00:11.235 --> 00:15.931
But these egotastic specimens of visual self-obsession are in danger.

00:16.723 --> 00:18.972
Danger caused by this.

00:21.628 --> 00:25.553
They used to be focused on just themselves like how their hair was the bomb...

00:25.779 --> 00:28.012
...or how adorbs their new shoes were.

00:28.426 --> 00:30.623
Just hashtag, hashtag, hashtag.

00:31.033 --> 00:35.824
Now they realized they can take pictures that capture so much more.

00:36.307 --> 00:40.217
Given their propensity to compare, compete and outdo each other,...

00:40.497 --> 00:46.077
...selfie sticks in the hands of these vain glorious Van Goghs are growing in size,...

00:46.246 --> 00:48.285
...doubling and tripling in length.

00:52.489 --> 00:56.877
Please warn those you love about the dangers of selfie stick abuse.

01:04.531 --> 01:06.198
Please selfie responsibly.
