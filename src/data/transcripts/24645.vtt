Do you think IBM can ever be as cool as a Google, as Apple?

00:05.828 --> 00:09.065
Monica, this question... Cool?

00:09.154 --> 00:11.826
If you think solving cancer is cool, then we're cool.

00:12.234 --> 00:16.508
If you think predicting a train or a plane having an outage ahead of time...

00:16.569 --> 00:18.809
...so there's not a problem is cool, then we're cool.

00:19.147 --> 00:22.677
If you think going all about trying to reinvent health care, then we're cool.

00:23.104 --> 00:25.041
And so, that to me is the definition of cool.

00:25.430 --> 00:28.930
And in fact, if anything, you know what's more important than just being cool,...

00:29.371 --> 00:30.525
...to me what's more important,...

00:30.710 --> 00:31.720
...is to be essential.
