ï»¿I have 422 friends, yet I am lonely.

00:05.479 --> 00:09.021
I speak to all of them every day, yet none of them really know me.

00:12.367 --> 00:14.368
The problem I have sits in the spaces between.

00:14.672 --> 00:16.865
Looking into their eyes or at a name on a screen.

00:17.570 --> 00:18.941
I took a step back and opened my eyes.

00:19.223 --> 00:23.265
I looked around and realized this media we call social is anything but.

00:23.937 --> 00:26.835
When we open our computers and it's our doors we shut.

00:27.767 --> 00:30.585
All this technology we have, it's just an illusion.

00:30.962 --> 00:33.324
Community, companionship, a sense of inclusion.

00:33.465 --> 00:36.805
Yet when you step away from this device of delusion.

00:37.449 --> 00:39.933
You awaken to see a world of confusion.

00:40.435 --> 00:42.279
So don't give in to a life where you follow the hype.

00:42.676 --> 00:44.646
Give people your love, don't give them your 'like'.

00:45.357 --> 00:47.657
Disconnect from the need to be heard and defined.

00:48.376 --> 00:50.988
Go out into the world, leave distractions behind.

00:54.733 --> 00:55.684
Look up from your phone.

00:56.299 --> 00:57.223
Shut down that display.

00:57.753 --> 00:58.743
Stop watching this video.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.296
Live life the real way.
