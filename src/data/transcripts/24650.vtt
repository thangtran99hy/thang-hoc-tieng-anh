What if your wallet was a Google Wallet?

00:03.311 --> 00:05.659
It would start with your cards: credit and debit.

00:06.299 --> 00:09.834
Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover,...

00:10.405 --> 00:12.573
...all stored securely in the cloud.

00:13.104 --> 00:16.899
All your cards, all together, in a virtual wallet that goes anywhere.

00:17.665 --> 00:22.222
Use it on your phone and tap to pay for a double shot macchiato at your favorite cafe.

00:24.491 --> 00:26.213
Or a taxi ride to the club.

00:27.622 --> 00:29.393
Or gummy bears at the movie theater.

00:31.593 --> 00:33.917
And when you go online, your wallet goes with you.

00:34.482 --> 00:38.073
So it's easier than ever to order everything you need for your next vacation.

00:38.976 --> 00:42.396
And that new song from your favorite band is just a single click away.

00:48.477 --> 00:50.788
Whether you're shopping in-store or online,...

00:51.068 --> 00:54.176
...Google Wallet keeps all your payment info safe and secure.

00:55.280 --> 00:57.790
It's everything you love all in one wallet.
