I started using Tinder after me and my last girlfriend broke up.

00:02.923 --> 00:06.849
I've matched with a few people but have no idea what to say to any of them...

00:07.017 --> 00:08.036
...to get the conversation going.

00:08.297 --> 00:09.952
What's a good, non-creepy opening line?

00:10.215 --> 00:11.697
I would say just don't be on Tinder,...

00:12.220 --> 00:14.657
...and like, go to a bar or do something else.

00:14.929 --> 00:16.683
Go out there into the world.

00:16.763 --> 00:19.615
It's much more challenging to go and talk to somebody in person.
