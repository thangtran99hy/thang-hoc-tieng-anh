00:00.186 --> 00:02.209
If we do this, there's no turning back.

00:03.081 --> 00:04.851
Your old life is over.

00:07.412 --> 00:08.011
What's that?

00:08.367 --> 00:09.550
Something to stop your heart.

00:09.929 --> 00:10.469
What?

00:10.821 --> 00:12.565
It's something to stop your heart!

00:29.056 --> 00:32.806
There is no science, no progress, without sacrifice.

00:33.481 --> 00:35.280
I never wanted others to suffer.

00:37.025 --> 00:38.568
I gave you what you wanted.

00:39.223 --> 00:40.177
You took a man's life!

00:40.387 --> 00:41.873
No, I did!

00:44.258 --> 00:47.081
Soon, I'll be gone. I can already feel myself fading.

00:47.755 --> 00:50.095
Without me, your mind will relapse.

00:55.315 --> 00:57.114
And we both know who takes over.

00:59.276 --> 01:02.810
I'm the only one standing between you and oblivion.
