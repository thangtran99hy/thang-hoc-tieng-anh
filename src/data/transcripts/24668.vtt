ï»¿A new device allows you to hear with your tongue.

00:04.843 --> 00:08.249
Researchers at Colorado State University are developing the technology...

00:08.342 --> 00:12.192
...which uses a bluetooth-enabled earpiece to detect sound...

00:12.341 --> 00:15.189
..and then send the electrical impulses to a retainer...

00:15.289 --> 00:17.997
...that wearers press against their tongue to hear.

00:18.095 --> 00:20.413
They're currently mapping the nerves on the tongue...

00:20.539 --> 00:23.330
...and they say it could take two to three months of wearing the device...

00:23.435 --> 00:28.671
...to teach your brain to interpret the signals on your tongue as words or sounds.

00:28.896 --> 00:32.179
Eventually, those with substantial hearing loss could use this...

00:32.277 --> 00:37.388
...as a significantly simpler and less expensive alternative to cochlear implants.
