A couple of weeks ago, we got an e-mail with a video in it...

00:03.742 --> 00:06.229
...of a self-piloted, waterproof drone.

00:07.720 --> 00:08.861
Would we like to see it work?

00:09.938 --> 00:10.410
You bet.

00:12.045 --> 00:15.756
Antoine Balaresque is a 24-year-old software engineer and roboticist...

00:15.833 --> 00:19.117
...who invited us to Central Park so his quadcopter drone called "Lily"...

00:19.384 --> 00:20.966
...could take pictures and video of us.

00:22.269 --> 00:24.062
The Lily camera is, for the first time,...

00:24.607 --> 00:26.755
...the camera flies and autonomously follows you around...

00:27.027 --> 00:29.428
...and getting great shots and footage of your life.

00:30.202 --> 00:31.817
The promo video looked amazing.

00:32.737 --> 00:36.839
What I look as cool is the people skiing down the slope in slow motion or even cooler.

00:37.650 --> 00:39.913
I'll never know because the footage never came out.

00:40.593 --> 00:42.205
I assume I looked fantastic.
