00:01.369 --> 00:02.853
Welcome to the Scorch!

00:05.274 --> 00:08.243
The world outside is hanging on by a very thin thread.

00:08.521 --> 00:12.781
Beyond this door lies the beginning of your new lives.

00:13.674 --> 00:15.941
I remember watching my friends die in front of me.

00:16.313 --> 00:17.884
Don't you want to understand?

00:18.055 --> 00:18.859
Understand what?

00:19.069 --> 00:20.199
Why this all happened?

00:21.172 --> 00:24.193
I just need to know, whose side are you on?

00:26.622 --> 00:27.696
They're hiding something.

00:27.833 --> 00:28.810
Come on, you don't know that!

00:29.955 --> 00:30.747
They lied to us.

00:30.897 --> 00:31.793
We never escaped.

00:32.109 --> 00:33.478
It's all just been part of their plan.

00:33.569 --> 00:34.565
What do they want from us?

00:37.235 --> 00:38.235
Thomas!

00:38.517 --> 00:39.590
The Maze is one thing.

00:40.005 --> 00:42.517
But you kids won't last one day out in the Scorch.
