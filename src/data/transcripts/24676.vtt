Singing on a stage in front of thousands of employees,...

00:03.410 --> 00:07.095
...Alibaba's Jack Ma is not your average corporate chairman.

00:08.419 --> 00:10.989
He flunked his college entrance exam twice.

00:11.369 --> 00:15.825
That may have been the last time Jack Ma set out to do something and failed.

00:17.255 --> 00:20.756
Ma is 49 years old and was trained as an English teacher.

00:21.031 --> 00:25.011
He learned the language by working as a tour guide and listening to Voice of America.

00:25.391 --> 00:28.827
Since then, he started one of China's first Internet companies.

00:29.473 --> 00:33.837
Later, Ma persuaded 80 people to give him $60,000.

00:34.088 --> 00:37.768
And that was the beginning of what is now the Alibaba Group.

00:38.671 --> 00:43.337
Alibaba is known for e-commerce both consumer and business-to-business.

00:43.565 --> 00:45.921
But Ma has broadened the company's interests.

00:46.159 --> 00:50.090
Alibaba is involved in cloud computing, banking, TV production...

00:50.165 --> 00:52.544
...and even has an online music service.

00:52.877 --> 00:57.528
Ma's personal fortune is valued around $13 billion.
