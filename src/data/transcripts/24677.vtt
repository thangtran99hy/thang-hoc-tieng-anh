Germans emigrating to the United States in the mid-19th century...

00:02.841 --> 00:04.317
...had to leave out of the port of Hamburg...

00:04.511 --> 00:06.521
...and would sometimes have to wait months for passage.

00:06.665 --> 00:09.806
It would have been at this point that they developed the fondness for a local dish...

00:09.937 --> 00:11.253
...called the Hamburg steak,...

00:11.433 --> 00:15.086
...which was chopped, cooked beef, served on a plate with potatoes and gravy.

00:15.275 --> 00:18.300
Upon arriving in New York City, the Germans found that their familiar food...

00:18.387 --> 00:21.354
...also made its way to America, and was already hugely popular,...

00:21.512 --> 00:25.108
...from high-end restaurants like Delmonico's to food carts all over Lower Manhattan.

00:25.347 --> 00:29.137
News of the Hamburg steak spread, and soon it was available all across America.

00:30.252 --> 00:31.677
Now, things get interesting.

00:32.007 --> 00:34.749
It took another 20 to 30 years for the Hamburg steak...

00:34.817 --> 00:36.547
...to be served between two slices of bread.

00:36.722 --> 00:40.643
From that point on, a patty between two buns became recognized around the world...

00:40.747 --> 00:43.285
...as a distinctly American dish called the hamburger.
