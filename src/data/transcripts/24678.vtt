Here are some tips to help you get through like a pro.

00:08.962 --> 00:11.475
Give yourself plenty of time to go through security...

00:12.467 --> 00:15.653
...and have your boarding pass ready to present to a screening officer.

00:19.530 --> 00:23.586
Families or passengers with special needs who need a little more time...

00:23.983 --> 00:27.540
...can take advantage of the dedicated Family Special Needs line.

00:29.815 --> 00:32.893
To avoid alarming, remove metal objects...

00:32.991 --> 00:35.571
...like keys and spare change from your pockets.

00:35.986 --> 00:39.369
Put them in your coat or carry-on bag before passing through.

00:40.731 --> 00:44.843
Cell phones, tablets and other electronics can stay in your carry-on.

00:47.072 --> 00:51.140
If you have a laptop, take it out of the case and put it in a bin.

00:52.246 --> 00:56.493
Your clear, plastic resealable bag of liquids, aerosols and gels,...

00:56.810 --> 00:59.689
...your coat and your purse also go in the bin.

01:00.996 --> 01:04.188

01:04.390 --> 01:05.815
...belts with metal buckles,...

01:06.146 --> 01:09.891
...steel-toed shoes or shoes with metal arches or shanks.

01:11.041 --> 01:14.037
Following these tips can save you time during screening.

01:15.415 --> 01:18.325
