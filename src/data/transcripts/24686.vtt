Hello, I'm Tony Butney with VOA60 America for August 21st.

00:07.894 --> 00:10.094
Defense Secretary Ashton Carter urged Turkey...

00:10.201 --> 00:13.223
...to do more in fighting Islamic State and controlling its border.

00:13.930 --> 00:18.829
Turkey agreed last month to allow US jets to attack Islamic State using an air base,...

00:19.366 --> 00:22.303
...but has focused its increased military participation in the region...

00:22.526 --> 00:25.265
...on its own long-running fight against Kurdish guerrillas.

00:25.995 --> 00:28.997
The US is hoping equal attention is given to Islamic State fighters...

00:29.139 --> 00:31.251
...crossing into Iraq and Syria from Turkey.

00:31.913 --> 00:36.095
A deadly forest fire in Washington State has grown to nearly 40,000 hectares.

00:36.420 --> 00:39.044
Three firefighters were killed Wednesday during their efforts.

00:40.740 --> 00:44.296
Finally, the first two women to graduate from the grueling Army Ranger program...

00:44.414 --> 00:46.078
...answered questions about their accomplishment.

00:46.695 --> 00:49.533
West Point graduates Kristen Griest and Shaye Haver...

00:49.664 --> 00:52.989
...say they hope their historic achievement will open doors for other women.
