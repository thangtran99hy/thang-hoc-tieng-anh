Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.

00:06.609 --> 00:08.251
Don't be trapped by dogma,...

00:08.510 --> 00:11.037
...which is living with the results of other people's thinking.

00:11.763 --> 00:15.312
Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.

00:16.565 --> 00:18.533
You've got to find what you love.

00:18.785 --> 00:21.598
And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.

00:22.687 --> 00:24.935
Your work is gonna fill a large part of your life...

00:25.183 --> 00:29.149
...and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.

00:29.505 --> 00:34.421
And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

00:35.089 --> 00:37.288
If you haven't found it yet, keep looking.

00:37.700 --> 00:38.796
And don't settle.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.227
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.

00:42.767 --> 00:46.331
They somehow already know what you truly want to become.
