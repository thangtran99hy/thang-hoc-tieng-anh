I feel a little scared about if I, you know, just walk down the street.

00:04.868 --> 00:07.706
Cops might just think I'm doing something bad.

00:07.774 --> 00:12.829
And then, if I try to explain to them, they won't listen and just start beating me up...

00:13.279 --> 00:14.596
...and doing terrible things to me.

00:15.091 --> 00:18.309
I think there's like, this anxiety that kind of comes with being biracial,...

00:18.421 --> 00:19.961
...like the kind that eats away at you.

00:21.882 --> 00:24.525
Almost like you have to prove yourself like you're one of the other.

00:25.478 --> 00:30.396
For example, I hate the phrase "you're not black" all the time.

00:30.712 --> 00:36.079
People sometimes think like, I'm supposed to talk ghetto or whatever that is.

00:36.539 --> 00:39.947
"Oh, she uneducated because she's African-American."

00:40.443 --> 00:44.501
Because I'm Hispanic or Latino, I can't have a lot of money.

00:44.946 --> 00:49.827
Just this weekend, I went with my friend to Urban Outfitters and we went shopping...

00:49.961 --> 00:51.835
...and I really wanted to try on this dress.

00:52.397 --> 00:56.716
And then, this lady there, she's kinda like watching me...

00:57.176 --> 01:00.411
...and it's like, I'm not gonna steal it or anything.
