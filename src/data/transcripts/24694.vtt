00:00.183 --> 00:01.458
Oh, dogs!

00:01.611 --> 00:03.841
A best friend that always has your back.

00:03.924 --> 00:06.541
In fact, studies have shown that men are three times...

00:06.616 --> 00:10.231
...more likely to get a girl's phone number if they have a dog by their side.

00:10.357 --> 00:12.923
And do you ever feel like your dog just gets you?

00:13.069 --> 00:16.716
It turns out that humans and dogs both respond to emotional sounds.

00:16.897 --> 00:19.070
When your dog hears you crying or laughing,...

00:19.189 --> 00:22.053
...the response in their brain is similar to that of a human's.

00:22.186 --> 00:23.976
You've probably heard of drug-sniffing dogs,...

00:24.065 --> 00:26.528
...but did you know that dogs can sense seizures,...

00:26.602 --> 00:29.389
...detect low blood sugar and can sniff out cancer?

00:29.555 --> 00:34.477
In one study, dogs were able to identify 30 of 33 cases of prostate cancer...

00:34.567 --> 00:36.101
...by smelling participants' urine.

00:36.345 --> 00:39.412
It's believed that dogs' highly sophisticated sense of smell...

00:39.599 --> 00:43.180
...can detect variation and the presence of volatile organic compounds.

00:43.321 --> 00:47.769
Their sense of smell is 10,000 to 10,000,000 times more sensitive than humans...

00:47.924 --> 00:48.941
...depending on the breed.

00:49.175 --> 00:52.043
On top of it all, humans really do love dogs!

00:52.192 --> 00:55.341
A recent study found that dogs activate the same hormonal response...

00:55.416 --> 00:57.987
...that triggers us to love and care for our own babies.

00:58.179 --> 01:01.016
Accompany that with studies showing decreased stress and anxiety,...

01:01.277 --> 01:04.414
...and it's clear why they have become such an important part of our lives.

01:04.650 --> 01:07.107
They truly are woman and man's best friend.
