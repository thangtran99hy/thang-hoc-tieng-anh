00:06.442 --> 00:08.019
Maybe we could restructure?

00:08.114 --> 00:10.175
Here's an idea, how about we restructure?

00:10.259 --> 00:11.977
Yes, great idea, Joanna.

00:16.389 --> 00:18.451
So, how do you manage the work-life balance?

00:21.191 --> 00:22.041
You like to bake?

00:22.134 --> 00:24.161
How about you handle the cake for Gina's birthday?

00:26.483 --> 00:28.528
Is work less of a priority for you now?

00:29.623 --> 00:32.123
Does your wife help with the kids?

00:34.753 --> 00:36.865
Wow, are you gonna eat all that yourself?

00:40.652 --> 00:44.271
Well, we shouldn't have too many men on the project, you know how that could be.

00:45.053 --> 00:47.803
I'm assuming you two can work together without getting catty.

00:51.303 --> 00:53.206
And then I said, "Well, I didn't know that."

00:53.987 --> 00:55.463
Look at you being funny.

00:55.606 --> 00:57.040
I didn't know men could be funny.
