Well, one of the definitions is that condition of a state...

00:05.282 --> 00:07.971
...where the happiness of another is essential to one's own.

00:08.342 --> 00:11.525
I think love is just a form of God.

00:11.681 --> 00:14.764
Well, if you're talking family wise it means everything,...

00:14.846 --> 00:20.243
...but if you're talking marriage, I mean you could be single,...

00:20.348 --> 00:22.189
...and that's kinda what I want to do.

00:22.679 --> 00:24.265
Wow, love is deep.

00:26.023 --> 00:27.467
You know, you're asking the wrong age group...

00:27.572 --> 00:30.777
...because the first thing I want to do is say love means never having to say you're sorry.

00:30.879 --> 00:32.791
Love means never having to say you're sorry,...

00:33.111 --> 00:35.729
...but I don't believe that at all cause I feel like you say you're sorry a lot.

00:36.203 --> 00:41.148
Love to me is the greatest marketing campaign ever invented.

00:41.298 --> 00:44.823
Love for me is being 100% vulnerable and all the way in you know.

00:44.973 --> 00:46.691
You can love yourself first.

00:47.623 --> 00:51.614
Once you learn how to love yourself, you can love anything in this world.

00:51.955 --> 00:55.394
Someone that loves you, loves you because you're you.

00:55.573 --> 00:57.551
Love means accepting people the way they are.

00:57.753 --> 00:59.051
It has to be a two-way street.

00:59.396 --> 01:04.429
It can't just be, I'm accepting you, you got to accept me too.
