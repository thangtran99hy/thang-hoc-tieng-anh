00:00.126 --> 00:01.528
Heck, let's brown bag that idea.

00:02.227 --> 00:03.293
I'll put it on the back burner.

00:03.417 --> 00:04.566
I'm gonna have to marinate on that.

00:04.711 --> 00:06.281
I don't think that's in the foreseeable future.

00:06.395 --> 00:07.557
That doesn't sound actionable.

00:07.732 --> 00:09.023
I'm not ready to get in bed with this.

00:09.715 --> 00:10.835
That's not mission-critical.

00:10.990 --> 00:12.325
I think that's sideways energy.

00:12.464 --> 00:13.889
That's not even in our wheelhouse.

00:14.044 --> 00:14.789
I don't have a wheelhouse.

00:15.481 --> 00:16.325
I mean, I have a house.
