My question for you is: at this point in your life,...

00:02.389 --> 00:04.327
...what is the one best piece of advice...

00:04.425 --> 00:06.639
...you could give to someone watching this video right now?

00:07.297 --> 00:07.702
Okay.

00:07.934 --> 00:09.476
My best piece of advice...

00:09.597 --> 00:10.618
Always to be yourself.

00:10.736 --> 00:11.930
Just to be kind.

00:12.207 --> 00:13.691
Just to be honest always.

00:13.861 --> 00:15.615
Just being comfortable in your own skin.

00:15.851 --> 00:19.852
I know that's really hard to do in a society that's so judgmental.

00:19.960 --> 00:24.184
It's the most important thing to not let anyone tell you who you have to be.

00:24.329 --> 00:28.761
If you're not cool with yourself, if you're not happy with who you are,...

00:28.895 --> 00:31.736
...how will other people see you the way you want to be seen?

00:31.833 --> 00:34.937
Stay true to yourself, and follow what you believe.
