The Internet needs a refresher course on words and what they mean.

00:04.613 --> 00:05.651
And we're here to help.

00:05.854 --> 00:07.340
I don't need no word refreshments.

00:07.858 --> 00:08.627
Yes, you do.

00:09.779 --> 00:11.321
Okay, this one's pretty easy.

00:11.677 --> 00:13.463
Let's start with "they're."

00:13.809 --> 00:16.301
"They're" is a contraction of two words.

00:16.615 --> 00:19.330
So it can only mean one thing: they are.

00:19.610 --> 00:22.919
So if you break the words apart in a sentence and it doesn't make sense,...

00:23.033 --> 00:25.361
...he is going over they are?

00:25.666 --> 00:26.785
Try again.

00:27.335 --> 00:30.065
Okay, so this leaves "there" and "their."

00:30.530 --> 00:31.897
"There" is a place.

00:32.497 --> 00:33.771
Here's an easy way to remember it.

00:34.292 --> 00:35.949
Here, there.

00:36.754 --> 00:37.543
Wait, where?

00:38.055 --> 00:39.711
Yeah, that's a good way to remember it too.

00:40.273 --> 00:40.676
What?

00:41.123 --> 00:41.731
Stop it.

00:42.564 --> 00:43.227
Why?

00:44.541 --> 00:46.656
So the only one left is "their,"...

00:46.837 --> 00:48.310
...which means it's this.

00:48.744 --> 00:52.037
Yeah, think for a second to make sure you're using the right one.

00:52.309 --> 00:55.341
You will learn this in the third grade, dummy!

00:55.433 --> 00:56.241
Don't say that!

00:56.328 --> 00:56.692
Why?
