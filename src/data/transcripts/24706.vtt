00:00.306 --> 00:03.556
Here's the rub: it's gonna be four years for another mission to reach me.

00:05.488 --> 00:07.653
And I'm in a Hab designed to last 31 days.

00:08.997 --> 00:12.538
So I got to make water and grow food on a planet where nothing grows.

00:13.967 --> 00:16.244
But if I can't figure out a way to make contact with NASA,...

00:16.409 --> 00:17.629
...then none of this matters anyway.

00:17.781 --> 00:19.234
We've got an incoming message.

00:23.032 --> 00:24.611
Mark Watney is still alive.

00:25.225 --> 00:26.427
NASA rejected the mission.

00:26.548 --> 00:27.715
So, if we do this?

00:28.063 --> 00:29.182
We're talking mutiny.

00:29.427 --> 00:32.324
If anything goes wrong, we die.

00:32.994 --> 00:34.657
Do you realize how crazy this is?

00:35.690 --> 00:36.981
We have no other options.

00:41.359 --> 00:42.684
No matter what happens,...

00:45.349 --> 00:46.255
...tell the world,...

00:49.173 --> 00:54.267
...tell my family that I never stopped fighting to make it home.
