00:00.129 --> 00:02.971
It's been a busy couple of days for the space flight community.

00:03.345 --> 00:07.865
NASA's New Horizons spacecraft made its closest approach to the dwarf planet Pluto...

00:07.965 --> 00:10.558
...on Tuesday at 7:50 AM Eastern.

00:10.912 --> 00:14.206
New Horizons has already sent back a ton of interesting images and data.

00:14.595 --> 00:18.817
The spacecraft recently solved a long-standing debate within the scientific community.

00:19.147 --> 00:20.959
How big is Pluto really?

00:21.770 --> 00:26.015
Turns out it's around 1,473 miles in diameter.

00:26.317 --> 00:29.605
That makes Pluto the largest object that we know of in the Kuiper Belt,...

00:29.969 --> 00:33.055
...the big region of icy bodies at the edge of our solar system.

00:33.568 --> 00:36.909
There's also a lot of excitement surrounding Pluto's surface features.

00:37.221 --> 00:40.276
On one side, Pluto has what it looks like a large white heart.

00:40.570 --> 00:43.311
On either side of the heart are two big dark splotches,...

00:43.617 --> 00:47.003
...recently given the terrifying names Cthulhu and Balrog.

00:47.282 --> 00:50.235
But scientists still aren't sure what kind of formations they are.

00:50.750 --> 00:55.747
High-resolution imaging of Pluto's surface revealed icy mountains over 11,000 feet high,...

00:56.135 --> 00:58.191
...that's six times One World Trade.

00:58.532 --> 01:01.973
Right now, New Horizons is moving even farther away from Pluto,...

01:02.319 --> 01:04.127
...but it's still studying the tiny world.

01:04.641 --> 01:08.732
After that, New Horizons is faded with wandering the cosmos forever.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.334
Well, until it breaks down.
