In the beginning, Jim was a small town player.

00:05.503 --> 00:08.248
He's a very smart, disciplined man.

00:08.577 --> 00:09.372
Take your shot.

00:09.841 --> 00:12.423
But make it your best, cause I get up, I eat you.

00:14.170 --> 00:16.036
Then, the next thing you know he's a damn kingpin.

00:16.966 --> 00:17.480
You know why?

00:18.031 --> 00:19.369
Because the FBI let it happen.

00:19.517 --> 00:22.249
I grew up with Jimmy and his brother Billy, the senator.

00:22.404 --> 00:24.673
And that is a bond that doesn't get broken.

00:24.817 --> 00:27.514
Your brother is wading into some very dark waters.

00:27.679 --> 00:29.804
Jimmy's business is Jimmy's business.

00:29.983 --> 00:30.994
We all need friends.

00:31.857 --> 00:34.005
Even Jimmy, even you.

00:37.706 --> 00:40.705
Bulger's playing us, making a fool of the Bureau.

00:41.348 --> 00:44.127
We're in too deep, and he knows it.

00:47.022 --> 00:47.819
God help us.

00:48.053 --> 00:50.021
How come no one has nailed Whitey Bulger?

00:50.407 --> 00:54.939
He seems to be involved in every crime in the city and yet the Bureau keeps saying he's clean.

00:55.099 --> 00:56.317
Well, what's Bulger done?

00:56.717 --> 00:58.277
What's he done?

00:59.275 --> 01:00.153
Everything.
