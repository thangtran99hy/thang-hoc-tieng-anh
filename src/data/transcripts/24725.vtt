Laughter is one of those rare and beautiful things shared by people all over Earth,...

00:12.776 --> 00:17.927
...a human experience that transcends borders of language, geography, and lifestyle.

00:18.383 --> 00:22.419
No one has to teach us to laugh, and people everywhere do it pretty much the same way.

00:23.384 --> 00:25.997
But it's also really, really strange.

00:27.583 --> 00:29.721
Humans laugh for a number of reasons,...

00:29.847 --> 00:32.930
...but most of the time it has nothing to do with funny business.

00:33.471 --> 00:35.441
Researchers like Robert Provine have found,...

00:35.559 --> 00:38.829
...after listening to hundreds of people laugh in social situations,...

00:39.066 --> 00:41.926
...less than one in five chuckles are in response to humor,...

00:42.117 --> 00:43.677
...and when a joke is involved,...

00:43.944 --> 00:47.009
...the person telling it is far more likely to be the one laughing.

00:47.419 --> 00:51.828
We're also 30 times more likely to laugh with other people around than if we're alone.

00:52.138 --> 00:55.865
If laughter is a form of communication, then what are we trying to say?

00:56.299 --> 01:00.211
We do it to communicate understanding, to show we like and accept others,...

01:00.485 --> 01:02.107
...to diffuse awkward situations,...

01:02.503 --> 01:04.695
...and yes, sometimes even to be mean.
