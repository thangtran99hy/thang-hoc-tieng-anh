You say I don't know I'm beautiful, but what if I did?

00:03.658 --> 00:07.239
What if I looked in the mirror and actually liked what I saw?

00:07.519 --> 00:10.345
Makeup or no makeup, flaws and all.

00:10.421 --> 00:12.647
What if I woke up really feeling myself...

00:13.192 --> 00:17.165
...and could post a selfie to Instagram without any self doubt?

00:17.496 --> 00:20.688
No questions, contemplations or hesitations...

00:20.928 --> 00:25.862
...because the only person's confirmation I would need is my own.

00:27.187 --> 00:31.344
You say I don't know I'm beautiful, but what if I did?

00:31.709 --> 00:34.357
What if I accepted compliments at face value...

00:34.447 --> 00:39.025
...instead of constantly feeling the need to devalue myself for the sake of someone else.

00:39.298 --> 00:39.991
No, stop.

00:40.395 --> 00:41.781
You're just saying that to be nice.

00:42.181 --> 00:44.096
You're just saying that because you're my friend.

00:44.503 --> 00:49.593
If you've ever caught yourself saying these words, please take a moment and think again.

00:50.130 --> 00:53.205
Please, take a moment to marvel at the radiance of your beauty,...

00:53.306 --> 00:55.477
...both from the outside and from within.
