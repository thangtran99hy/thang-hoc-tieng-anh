There's a new wave of Android Wear watches coming out this fall,...

00:05.457 --> 00:06.611
...and they're gonna have a new trick.

00:06.875 --> 00:08.579
They're gonna work with the iPhone,...

00:08.830 --> 00:11.704
...that means the Apple watch is gonna have a lot more competition pretty soon.

00:12.097 --> 00:13.268
But the big question is,...

00:13.450 --> 00:16.676
...how much can Google's watches do when they're paired with iOS?

00:17.012 --> 00:18.759
We went to Google's Headquarters to find out.

00:21.421 --> 00:26.445
So today, we're announcing that we're bringing Android Wear to iOS.

00:26.825 --> 00:29.551
So if you have an iPhone, you can also use these watches.

00:29.791 --> 00:32.866
I actually got a chance to set up Android wear with my own iPhone,...

00:33.017 --> 00:34.582
...and the setup was actually really simple.

00:34.854 --> 00:38.195
You just download the Android Wear app from the App Store, install it on your phone,...

00:38.517 --> 00:40.767
...pair it with an Android Wear watch and you're done.

00:41.348 --> 00:45.617
But Google can't dig down deep into the bones of iOS the way that the Apple watch can...

00:45.738 --> 00:48.221
...and that introduces some complications.

00:48.774 --> 00:52.193
Google actually manage to work around a lot of them especially with notifications,...

00:52.645 --> 00:55.379
...but the problem is, there are few things that the Android Wear app...

00:55.487 --> 00:56.848
...just can't do with iOS.

00:56.963 --> 01:00.445
At launch, Android Wear is only gonna work for few watches with the iPhone.

01:00.788 --> 01:04.780
The Huawei Watch, the Asus Zen Watch 2, and the LG Watch Urbane.

01:05.047 --> 01:07.147
But a lot more are coming very, very soon.

01:07.241 --> 01:09.545
And that's gonna mean a lot of competition for the Apple watch.

01:09.758 --> 01:12.875
They might not be able to match it on features but they can definitely be competitive...

01:13.131 --> 01:15.588
...on the numbers of styles and on price.
