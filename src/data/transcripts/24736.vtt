00:00.313 --> 00:03.503
Leaving the temple, on our way to Skytree, we saw a rickshaw.

00:03.975 --> 00:07.497
It's kind of cool because you get to see the modern cars passing behind it.

00:07.826 --> 00:10.323
We're gonna challenge ourselves at Tokyo Skytree.

00:10.527 --> 00:16.147
It is new and it's also the largest broadcasting tower built in 2008.

00:16.555 --> 00:16.886
Here.

00:21.817 --> 00:23.224
And here's our ticket.

00:23.468 --> 00:28.222
After a smooth but heart-accelerating elevator ride, we arrived at the dock.

00:30.489 --> 00:31.451
Can you believe this?

00:31.647 --> 00:35.380
We are now officially 450 meters above the ground.

00:35.671 --> 00:39.973
And we have to tell you that the city outside these windows is amazing.

00:40.225 --> 00:42.565
Wow! Things are so tiny down there.

00:44.101 --> 00:48.543
It is really amazing how a neighborhood around a traditional temple...

00:48.742 --> 00:51.366
...could quickly transform into a bustling city.

00:51.769 --> 00:55.860
Indeed, modernization is not an excuse to eradicate our heritage,...

00:56.295 --> 00:59.373
...and we think that Japan has just proven that to the world.
