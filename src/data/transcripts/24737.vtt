00:01.077 --> 00:03.777
Now, my friends always tell me that a Japanese...

00:03.901 --> 00:06.873
...is really good at balancing tradition and modernity.

00:07.327 --> 00:10.269
So today, we would like to see whether this is true or not.

00:10.459 --> 00:12.400
And our first stop will be Senso-ji.

00:13.683 --> 00:15.002
So we're now at Senso-ji.

00:15.312 --> 00:17.522
It's one of the oldest temples in Tokyo,...

00:17.973 --> 00:20.723
...and dates back to 1,400 years ago.

00:20.977 --> 00:23.828
So to my upper right, you see a big, red lantern.

00:25.307 --> 00:28.500
You can't leave a temple without trying some local food.

00:28.778 --> 00:32.198
So we are now on our way to try out some tasty snacks.

00:32.505 --> 00:33.825
Are you ready?

00:40.499 --> 00:46.162
Ningyo-yaki. These are Japanese traditional sweets, and I'm trying it now.

00:48.023 --> 00:48.678
Oh, it's packed.

00:50.847 --> 00:51.653
Look at this thing.

00:53.543 --> 00:55.717
Actually, there are a variety of shapes,...

00:56.646 --> 01:00.504
...so it's fun to discover different types of shapes.

01:03.642 --> 01:04.470
How does it taste like?

01:06.768 --> 01:08.189
I like this, it's really nice.

01:08.295 --> 01:09.567
What's inside? Can you show it to me?

01:09.936 --> 01:10.141
Yeah.

01:11.891 --> 01:13.594
So I see there's red beans.

01:13.675 --> 01:19.230
Yeah, it's filled with anko, which is sweet, smooth red bean paste.

01:19.641 --> 01:21.935
And I like it so please try it.

01:22.107 --> 01:23.943
It's popular in Asakusa.

01:24.917 --> 01:25.946
Oh, this is funny.

01:26.183 --> 01:27.641
Before entering the temple,...

01:27.829 --> 01:31.653
...we saw a boy trying to get the smoke of incense onto his head.

01:31.945 --> 01:34.677
This is a spirit cleansing ritual, I guess.

01:36.232 --> 01:39.197
In the temple, we did a prayer in Buddhist style.

01:39.536 --> 01:42.615
You know, when you're in Rome, you gotta do what the Romans do.
