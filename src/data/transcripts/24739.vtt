We always call APAC as a region as being on the rocket ship...

00:07.260 --> 00:09.271
...because we have just started our journey...

00:09.348 --> 00:11.551
...that's truly one percent done.

00:11.625 --> 00:15.113
If you look at the way technology is evolving,...

00:15.307 --> 00:17.215
...I think there is a massive opportunity...

00:17.286 --> 00:20.907
...to get the rest of like, the 2, 3, 4, 5 billion people, online.

00:21.025 --> 00:22.600
We've got a front seat with a window...

00:22.961 --> 00:25.533
...in that this is where a lot of the growth is actually happening.

00:25.987 --> 00:29.297
The single largest region in the world for Facebook is Asia-Pacific.

00:29.551 --> 00:33.631
At Facebook, we have the mission to give power to people...

00:34.049 --> 00:36.097
...and make the world more open connected.

00:36.454 --> 00:38.381
And the reason we think about it as a mission is...

00:38.467 --> 00:41.691
...because we commit and deliver value not only to who we work with...

00:42.005 --> 00:46.327
...but also to people outside of Facebook across the world.

00:46.853 --> 00:49.743
One of the things I love about working on Facebook is that...

00:49.864 --> 00:51.557
...we are a mission-led company.

00:52.107 --> 00:56.018
It's a very exciting time to be in this region for Facebook...

00:56.122 --> 01:00.358
...because there's so much growth potential, so much opportunity to be filled.

01:00.586 --> 01:04.639
If you wanna work in an environment that you have a strong sense of ownership,...

01:04.890 --> 01:08.492
...you get to work with a bunch of elite, smart people on high-impact projects...

01:08.623 --> 01:11.871
...that have a massive impact on billions of people, then this is the place to work.
