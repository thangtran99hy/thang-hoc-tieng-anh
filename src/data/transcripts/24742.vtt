Hey guys. So I probably should've made this video...

00:03.749 --> 00:05.891
...before I went mixing in apples for about three weeks.

00:05.991 --> 00:08.476
But the reason I haven't posted in a while is because,...

00:08.647 --> 00:10.015
...well, there's actually three reasons why.

00:10.145 --> 00:13.176
The first reason is because I recently just got back from Singapore and Malaysia...

00:13.284 --> 00:14.369
...because I had a couple of shows.

00:14.478 --> 00:15.399
It looked something like this.

00:18.885 --> 00:20.161
The second reason is pretty obvious.

00:20.271 --> 00:22.931
I'm sure you guys can hear it but I got pretty sick on that trip.

00:23.028 --> 00:24.261
And it looks something like this.

00:25.403 --> 00:26.997
And finally, last but not least,...

00:27.094 --> 00:31.443
...the third reason is because well, I'm filming a movie!

00:31.687 --> 00:32.675
Listen to my voice.

00:32.919 --> 00:33.666
Let me do another take.

00:33.817 --> 00:36.467
The last reason is because I'm filming a movie,...

00:36.574 --> 00:37.919
...since you couldn't understand what I just said.

00:38.035 --> 00:41.053
That's right, I'm a freaking mainstream Hollywood movie star now.

00:41.161 --> 00:43.503
Well I mean, I'm not exactly the star of the film...

00:43.644 --> 00:45.003
...so I guess you can't really call me a movie star.

00:45.093 --> 00:47.818
And it's not exactly mainstream because it's an independent film.

00:47.935 --> 00:49.271
And it's not even shot in Hollywood.

00:49.357 --> 00:50.605
It's shot in Downtown LA.

00:50.723 --> 00:52.415
But it's still a real movie, okay.

00:52.523 --> 00:54.289
And I'm still a real movie star, okay.

00:54.761 --> 00:57.340
I had so many lines, it looked just like this.

00:59.225 --> 01:02.134
No buttons, guess they really don't want us to leave.

01:02.945 --> 01:03.862
Who'd wanna leave?

01:06.583 --> 01:07.885
I'm a movie star.
