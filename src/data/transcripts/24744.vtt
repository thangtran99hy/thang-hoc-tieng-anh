So, you want to ride the New York City subway?

00:12.328 --> 00:13.022
Great idea!

00:13.119 --> 00:15.023
It's the preferred way for locals to get around.

00:15.447 --> 00:19.520
But with 468 subway stations and 24 separate lines,...

00:19.865 --> 00:21.693
...you'll need to know a few things first.

00:22.874 --> 00:26.015
The New York City subway lines are organized by letter, number, and color.

00:26.679 --> 00:28.059
Know which direction you are going.

00:28.435 --> 00:32.699
Some stations like Union Square and Times Square have an entrance that leads to all lines.

00:33.102 --> 00:36.653
But some smaller entrances are one-way: uptown or downtown.

00:37.094 --> 00:38.901
Make sure you know you're going in the right direction.

00:39.793 --> 00:43.371
A standard ride on the subway is 2.50 for a single ride MetroCard.

00:43.730 --> 00:46.804
As long as you stay underground, you can ride numerous lines on the same card...

00:47.175 --> 00:49.433
...and even transfer to a bus for no additional fee.

00:50.258 --> 00:53.359
If you're in New York for a week, it pays to buy the weekly pass.

00:55.413 --> 00:57.139
There's only one way to swipe the card:...

00:57.553 --> 00:59.836
...with the black stripe facing towards you and down.
