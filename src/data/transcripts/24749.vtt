You're gonna change somewhere in the neighborhood of 5,000 diapers,...

00:04.069 --> 00:09.623
...tie something like 1,200 pairs of shoelaces, blow on about 65 uh-ohs...

00:10.336 --> 00:12.964
...and then, reach a point in time where you don't do any of that...

00:13.439 --> 00:14.263
...and miss it all.

00:15.659 --> 00:18.262
There are only a few things you should truly worry about.

00:19.260 --> 00:21.683
Most of them aren't what people tell you to worry about.

00:22.956 --> 00:25.373
Parenting is 95% intent...

00:26.471 --> 00:28.129
...and 95% luck...

00:28.900 --> 00:30.488
...and 0% math.

00:31.059 --> 00:32.647
Make the best decisions you can.

00:33.165 --> 00:34.609
Things will work out fine.
