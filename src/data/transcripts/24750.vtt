00:00.416 --> 00:04.491
In the end, there are really just four gifts you give your children...

00:04.577 --> 00:06.153
...that nobody can ever take away.

00:07.592 --> 00:08.735
Time is the first.

00:10.123 --> 00:10.940
Give it liberally,...

00:12.461 --> 00:15.987
...and know that time speeds up every year until it learns to fly.

00:18.104 --> 00:19.620
The second is education.

00:20.670 --> 00:22.873
They'll take learning as seriously as you do.

00:24.177 --> 00:25.495
The third is spiritual.

00:26.463 --> 00:29.306
Knowing there's something larger than us keeps us grounded.

00:30.435 --> 00:32.639
And the fourth is love.

00:33.247 --> 00:35.265
The other three pale in comparison.

00:36.563 --> 00:38.507
If you remember nothing else but these,...

00:39.463 --> 00:42.745
...you'll have gone a long way toward doing all any parent ever hopes...

00:42.811 --> 00:44.019
...to do for their child.

00:45.263 --> 00:46.252
Protect tomorrow.
