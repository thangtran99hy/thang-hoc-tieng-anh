00:01.559 --> 00:02.970
I love you, Wade Wilson.

00:03.597 --> 00:04.629
We can fight this.

00:05.526 --> 00:05.911
You're right.

00:06.344 --> 00:08.520
The cancer's only in my liver, lungs, prostate and brain,...

00:08.962 --> 00:10.177
...all things I can live without.

00:12.551 --> 00:15.385
What if I told you we can make you better?

00:17.876 --> 00:18.702
You're a fighter.

00:19.021 --> 00:22.604
We can give you abilities most men only dream of,...

00:23.134 --> 00:25.246
...make you a superhero.

00:26.063 --> 00:27.665
You just promise you'll do right by me,...

00:28.360 --> 00:29.972
...so I can do right by someone else.

00:30.679 --> 00:33.701
And please don't make the super suit green, or animated.

00:34.583 --> 00:37.361
Oh God, you are hard to look at.

00:37.672 --> 00:39.955
You look like the topographical map of Utah.

00:40.657 --> 00:41.165
Exactly.
