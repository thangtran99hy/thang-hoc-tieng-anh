00:02.779 --> 00:04.535
Out here in the wild,...

00:06.057 --> 00:14.142
...when you don't fit in, life can be a real bear.

00:14.763 --> 00:16.069
Especially for Norm.

00:16.153 --> 00:18.339
What good is a bear if he can't even hunt, huh?

00:18.453 --> 00:21.120
Why don't you take a picture? It'll last longer.

00:22.646 --> 00:24.560
But when his home is threatened...

00:24.697 --> 00:26.553
Humans are invading our land.

00:27.094 --> 00:29.345
Read them and weep, boys! Caribou yeah!

00:29.585 --> 00:31.032
I want one!

00:31.132 --> 00:32.617
He'll finally discover...

00:32.731 --> 00:33.791
Humans are moving here now!

00:33.945 --> 00:35.447
Look! From Florida.

00:36.677 --> 00:38.863
...what he was born to do.

00:38.979 --> 00:42.124
Go to the city Norm, and convince them not to move here.

00:42.489 --> 00:44.060
We need to convince people to help you,...

00:44.309 --> 00:45.654
...and I have an idea.

00:46.822 --> 00:50.583
Backup dancers, let's show them who we really are.

00:50.712 --> 00:54.397
Ladies and gentlemen, Norm of the North!

00:55.985 --> 00:57.503
Fleming, look out!

00:59.327 --> 01:00.642
Wait for it...

01:01.164 --> 01:03.512
Geez, they don't call this place a concrete jungle for nothing.

01:04.191 --> 01:05.695
Norm of the North.
