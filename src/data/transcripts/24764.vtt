It's often culturally and socially reinforced...

00:02.951 --> 00:06.502
...that there's something wrong or shameful about feeling sad.

00:06.998 --> 00:11.039
We tend to have this cultural bias towards valuing positive thinking.

00:11.445 --> 00:14.595
But studies have shown that those who try and suppress negative thoughts...

00:14.708 --> 00:16.934
...actually experience more of them,...

00:17.116 --> 00:20.867
...which can lead to overeating and stronger stress responses.

00:21.167 --> 00:25.863
Inside Out shows us that our negative emotions can guide our rational thinking.

00:26.279 --> 00:29.415
Sadness is a trigger for seeking comfort and bonding.

00:29.754 --> 00:34.399
We're often tough on sadness, but it's important to our understanding of who we are.

00:34.868 --> 00:38.149
In his 1621 work "Anatomy of Melancholy",...

00:38.251 --> 00:43.793
...Robert Burton wrote, in experiencing melancholy, "increaseth sorrow, increaseth wisdom."

00:44.393 --> 00:49.492
Even those emotions that we consider as negative can help guide us to good, rational decisions.

00:50.283 --> 00:55.091
So, even if you're riding down or inside out the emotional roller coaster,...

00:55.408 --> 01:00.165
...remember that your positive and negative emotions can and do team up.

01:00.772 --> 01:02.486
There's always an upside.
