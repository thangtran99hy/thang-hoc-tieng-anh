Is there intelligent life beyond our galaxy?

00:07.465 --> 00:12.643
Or the one question that has puzzled mankind since the beginning of time:...

00:16.959 --> 00:20.290
...if God exists, then why did he make ugly people?

00:23.579 --> 00:24.827
200 lander?

00:24.992 --> 00:27.218
No, Derek, Zoolander.

00:27.481 --> 00:28.625
It's like a pun.

00:28.815 --> 00:30.559
But I don't spell my name with a 2.

00:30.811 --> 00:32.153
Fine. How about...

00:34.249 --> 00:36.020
Zoolander I I?

00:36.199 --> 00:39.704
No, Zoolander 2 but with Roman numerals.

00:39.868 --> 00:40.899
But I'm not Italian.

00:41.575 --> 00:45.394
Jesus. You are so freaking stupid, it's insane.
