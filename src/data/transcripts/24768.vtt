Have you ever been told, because you're a girl, that you should not do something?

00:07.315 --> 00:07.939
Yes.

00:09.249 --> 00:09.707
All the time.

00:09.931 --> 00:10.426
All the time.

00:10.515 --> 00:11.657
It's a constant.

00:17.890 --> 00:20.867
I want you to go grab one of those boxes over there.

00:22.024 --> 00:23.818
This represents your limitation.

00:24.217 --> 00:28.549
So I'd like you to write on each one, one of the things that you said.

00:31.298 --> 00:35.682
I told myself that I should stop if I'm not good.

00:35.933 --> 00:36.899
And did you quit?

00:38.153 --> 00:39.075
For a week.

00:40.211 --> 00:41.281
And then what happened?

00:42.155 --> 00:45.159
I proved them wrong by trying harder to get better.

00:45.281 --> 00:48.485
I think that you need to keep going with whatever you love to do...

00:48.561 --> 00:49.852
...and do anything you want.

00:49.922 --> 00:53.900
You can conquer any fear you've had and just live your dream...

00:53.966 --> 00:55.683
...and do whatever you want to do and...

00:56.432 --> 00:58.279
That's why I love the word "unstoppable."
