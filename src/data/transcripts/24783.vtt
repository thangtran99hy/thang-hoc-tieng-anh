00:00.053 --> 00:01.521
When I decided to do this,...

00:02.535 --> 00:05.835
...I first talked to my wife who is sitting here in the audience.

00:05.912 --> 00:10.725
And she had married a relatively stable, goofy...

00:10.863 --> 00:15.087
...but still relatively stable person working at a Wall Street firm.

00:15.311 --> 00:19.635
I worked at a quantitative hedge fund and this was a hard decision.

00:19.761 --> 00:22.760
And I was looking for the right framework...

00:23.073 --> 00:25.975
...in which to make that kind of important decision.

00:26.603 --> 00:32.012
And the right framework I found is a Regret Minimization Framework.

00:32.207 --> 00:37.673
And that's just a nerdy way of saying that you wanna project yourself to age 80,...

00:38.675 --> 00:42.587
...and then think back over your life and if you're 80,...

00:42.692 --> 00:46.392
...you wanna minimize the number of regrets you have throughout that period of time.

00:46.471 --> 00:51.953
I think this is something a lot of people do maybe subconsciously, they probably...

00:52.053 --> 00:55.055
...very few people probably name it Regret Minimization Framework...

00:55.199 --> 00:56.840
...because most people are healthier than that.

00:57.615 --> 01:04.425
But it was a very clear way for me to think about making that kind of life decision.

01:05.246 --> 01:10.553
And the way it helped was I thought, okay, if I go do this thing...

01:10.640 --> 01:12.661
...and participate in this thing called the Internet...

01:12.755 --> 01:15.079
...that I genuinely believe is gonna be a big deal.

01:15.731 --> 01:19.180
And if I fail, am I gonna regret having tried and failed?

01:19.271 --> 01:20.989
I knew the answer to that was no.
