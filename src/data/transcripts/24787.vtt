00:00.015 --> 00:01.082
I'm in meetings a lot.

00:01.207 --> 00:03.679
My calendar gets very full with those.

00:03.869 --> 00:06.365
And then at night, after the kids have gone to bed,...

00:06.436 --> 00:08.357
...I'm on email a great deal.

00:08.453 --> 00:10.320
I get messages during the day.

00:10.385 --> 00:13.116
That's my chance to give long responses and then, over the weekend,...

00:13.702 --> 00:16.783
...I send a lot of mail as well.

00:17.151 --> 00:20.490
I take two weeks a year to just go off and read and think...

00:20.607 --> 00:22.919
...where I'm not interrupted by work or anything else.

00:22.991 --> 00:26.446
I'm just solidly trying to think about the future and...

00:26.886 --> 00:30.607
...people get to send me things to read as part of that so-called "Think Week,"...

00:30.747 --> 00:32.527
...so it's a nice mix of things.

00:32.923 --> 00:36.819
About 25% of the time that I'm out, traveling around,...

00:36.939 --> 00:39.627
...meeting with customers in Europe, Asia.

00:39.777 --> 00:43.385
And that sort of helps me think, "Okay, do we have the right priorities?"

00:43.490 --> 00:45.545
What are people responding well to...

00:45.620 --> 00:48.013
...and what would they like to see us do better?
