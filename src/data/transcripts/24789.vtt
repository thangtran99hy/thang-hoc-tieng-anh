00:00.111 --> 00:06.019
I had one habit that I developed when I was at college.

00:06.134 --> 00:08.097
It was actually a very bad habit which was...

00:08.625 --> 00:11.400
...I liked to show people that I didn't do any work.

00:12.301 --> 00:16.732
And that I didn't go to classes and I didn't care, and then at the very last minute,...

00:17.757 --> 00:20.541
...like, two days before the test, I get serious about it.

00:20.861 --> 00:23.605
And people thought that was funny.

00:24.297 --> 00:25.411
You know, that was my positioning:...

00:25.561 --> 00:27.653
...the guy who did nothing until the last minute.

00:27.953 --> 00:31.970
Then when I went into business, that was a really bad habit.

00:32.923 --> 00:35.207
And it took me a couple years to get over that.

00:35.301 --> 00:39.298
Nobody praised me because I would do things at the last minute.

00:39.653 --> 00:42.704
And I tried the reverse to students I'd actually...

00:43.697 --> 00:48.074
...I didn't think that highly of, who were always organized and had things done on time.

00:48.328 --> 00:49.137
I'm still working on it,...

00:49.250 --> 00:52.417
...but procrastination is not a good habit.
