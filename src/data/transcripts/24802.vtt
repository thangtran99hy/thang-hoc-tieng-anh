Last September, I launched a campaign at the UN in New York called HeForShe,...

00:10.455 --> 00:14.332
...which is about men coming in support of women,...

00:14.446 --> 00:17.232
...and women supporting men to achieve gender equality.

00:20.153 --> 00:26.827
I want to get this conversationalist dialogue happening specifically within the fashion industry...

00:26.924 --> 00:30.970
...to ask the leading voices about gender equality.

00:31.561 --> 00:35.096
I have big hopes for gender equality in the fashion industry.

00:35.737 --> 00:37.472
I think it's really improving.

00:37.567 --> 00:41.982
I've seen some very positive steps towards equality in the industry,...

00:42.101 --> 00:46.375
...but I think there's still a lot of racism, I think there's still a lot of sexism.

00:46.538 --> 00:53.770
I'd really, really love to see a more diverse representation of women and men...

00:53.935 --> 00:58.949
...in any way that makes them feel empowered.
