Booking.com, this is Brad speaking.

00:02.437 --> 00:03.291
How may I help you?

00:04.785 --> 00:09.211
Ah, you're locked out of your hotel in the middle of the night after a 12-hour flight?

00:09.399 --> 00:14.356
Ah, I see. Okay, so you've booked a hotel in Manchester, Vermont instead of Manchester, England.

00:14.619 --> 00:17.812
So, they gave you a view of the kitchen instead of the mountains?

00:18.879 --> 00:21.417
Don't worry, we'll sort it out for you.

00:21.721 --> 00:24.529

Are you a superhuman communicator with a passion for friendly service?

00:59.994 --> 01:03.562
And are you an ace in English on top of your mother tongue?

01:04.115 --> 01:07.593
It's the operating language of the company, so you need to be fluent.

01:08.074 --> 01:11.709
