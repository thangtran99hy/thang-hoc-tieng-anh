This is Green Beat for a healthier planet.

00:03.178 --> 00:05.090
Most people go to a hotel to relax,...

00:05.228 --> 00:08.047
...but these permanent guests are keeping busy making honey...

00:08.138 --> 00:10.206
...and pollinating the rooftop herb garden...

00:10.386 --> 00:12.782
...at Vancouver's Fairmont Waterfront Hotel.

00:13.285 --> 00:16.200
Bee butler Michael King is enthusiastic about his charges...

00:16.321 --> 00:19.486
...because of their role in pollinating much of the world's agriculture.

00:19.713 --> 00:23.301
Their ability to navigate, their ability to feed themselves,...

00:23.531 --> 00:26.382
...their ability to feed us as a result of what they do.

00:27.155 --> 00:29.760
The Fairmont Waterfront Hotel is a green hotel...

00:29.867 --> 00:31.798
...certified by Green Key Global,...

00:32.112 --> 00:35.135
...an environmental group that specializes in the hotel industry.

00:35.620 --> 00:37.985
There's a complimentary parking for electric vehicles...

00:38.254 --> 00:40.878
...and guests are served the honey produced on-site.

00:41.518 --> 00:44.716
The hotel also promotes sustainability with its rooftop garden,...

00:44.931 --> 00:48.169
...which helps save rainwater and insulates the interior of the building.

00:48.383 --> 00:51.325
The hotel says it's on a mission to be certified zero waste...

00:51.469 --> 00:55.743
...by the end of next year through reusing, repurposing and recycling.
