00:00.535 --> 00:04.077
ï»¿When I graduated from the university...

00:04.227 --> 00:07.928
...and for three years I tried to fill in the universities.

00:08.287 --> 00:12.290
So I applied for jobs 30 times and got rejected.

00:13.126 --> 00:14.325
I went for the police.

00:14.452 --> 00:15.717
They said, "No, you're not good."

00:16.051 --> 00:18.603
I went even to KFC.

00:18.691 --> 00:20.549
 When KFC came to China, came to my city,...

00:22.109 --> 00:22.497
You applied?

00:23.061 --> 00:25.657
...twenty-four people went for the job.

00:26.571 --> 00:28.213
Twenty-three people were accepted.

00:28.329 --> 00:29.095
I was the one guy.

00:30.709 --> 00:31.943
And we went for the police.

00:32.057 --> 00:34.198
Five people, four of them got accepted.

00:34.315 --> 00:36.229
I was the only guy who did not receive it.

00:36.721 --> 00:39.599
So to me, being turned down, rejected...

00:39.963 --> 00:44.089
Oh by the way, I told you that I applied to Harvard ten times.

00:44.175 --> 00:44.662
Rejected.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.705
I know I'll be rejected, I just wanna say that.

00:48.040 --> 00:48.878
They're sorry now.

00:50.571 --> 00:53.176
Ten times you wrote them and said, "I'd like to come to Harvard."

00:53.960 --> 00:54.092
Yeah.

00:54.637 --> 00:57.035
And then I told myself, "Someday I should go teach there maybe."
