For centuries, humans have stared at cats and wondered, "What are they thinking?"

00:05.461 --> 00:08.766
When a cat purrs, we tend to assume it's saying, "I'm happy."

00:09.437 --> 00:10.042
Wrong.

00:10.267 --> 00:11.340
It's more complicated.

00:11.843 --> 00:14.503
Research shows cats do purr when they're happy...

00:14.623 --> 00:16.567
...but also when they're injured or sick.

00:17.111 --> 00:20.961
It means they want you to stick around whether it's for cuddling or for care.

00:21.293 --> 00:25.117
In other words, a purr means something like, "Don't go anywhere, please!"

00:25.450 --> 00:29.101
How about when your cat rubs against your legs after you come home from work?

00:29.374 --> 00:31.847
You might think it's just asking for food or attention.

00:32.583 --> 00:33.446
Not exactly.

00:33.894 --> 00:37.983
In the wild, cats who have finished up a hunt will come back and rub their pals...

00:38.055 --> 00:40.315
...like Vikings giving warrior hugs.

00:40.497 --> 00:43.543
A rub means something like, "We are reunited, old friend!"

00:43.675 --> 00:44.779
"I have missed thee!"

00:45.443 --> 00:46.420
What about meowing?

00:46.751 --> 00:50.871
It turns out that cats almost never meow to communicate with other cats.

00:51.335 --> 00:55.226
It's a behavior they seem to have adopted as a way of trying to talk to humans.

00:55.635 --> 00:58.412
In fact, there's no universal "meow" language.

00:58.603 --> 01:00.213
It's tailored to a cat's owner.

01:00.873 --> 01:04.891
A 2003 study showed that only a cat's owner can correctly guess...

01:04.983 --> 01:06.897
...what his or her cat is meowing about.

01:07.317 --> 01:11.282
So, if you hang out with your cat enough, you, and basically only you...

01:11.576 --> 01:15.829
...will know if it's begging for food, asking for help or just saying it's bored.
