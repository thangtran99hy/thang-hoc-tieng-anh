You focus on signal over noise.

00:04.271 --> 00:05.711
A lot of companies get confused.

00:06.101 --> 00:09.673
They spend money on things that don't actually make the product better.

00:10.220 --> 00:15.120
For example, at Tesla, we've never spent any money on advertising.

00:16.245 --> 00:20.861
We've put all the money into R & D and manufacturing and design,...

00:21.189 --> 00:23.244
...to try to make the car as good as possible.

00:24.965 --> 00:28.287
And I think that's the way to go.

00:28.538 --> 00:29.516
For any given company,...

00:29.633 --> 00:35.111
...just keep thinking about: are these efforts that people are expending,...

00:35.225 --> 00:37.745
...are they resulting in a better product or service?

00:38.054 --> 00:39.700
And if they're not, stop those efforts.
