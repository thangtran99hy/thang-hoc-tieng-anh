Well, our story starts in 1981.

00:02.829 --> 00:06.977
A small software company called Microsoft hit it big with a text-based operating system...

00:07.097 --> 00:10.199
...called MS-DOS for IBM's new personal computers.

00:10.397 --> 00:11.687
DOS was efficient for the time,...

00:11.878 --> 00:14.331
...but the average computer user wanted something more accessible.

00:14.675 --> 00:17.873
	 So, Microsoft used an internal product called Interface Manager...

00:18.025 --> 00:19.767
...to put a graphical face on DOS.

00:20.615 --> 00:23.161
Cut to 1985 and you got Windows 1.0.

00:23.336 --> 00:24.769
This really is a great product.

00:24.887 --> 00:28.103
It may look crude but this first version of Windows was pretty revolutionary.

00:28.452 --> 00:31.133
It brought us the things we know and love to this day:...

00:31.614 --> 00:34.712
...drop-down menus, scroll bars, icons and dialog boxes.

00:35.255 --> 00:37.575
It also used this new device called a mouse.

00:37.826 --> 00:42.288
To help users practice their mousing skills, version 1.1 included the game Reversi.

00:42.588 --> 00:44.690
Can you believe it? Reversi!

00:44.868 --> 00:49.568
In 1987, Windows 2.0 arrived with better graphics, including overlapping windows.

00:49.898 --> 00:55.139
One year later, Microsoft became and stayed the largest PC software maker.

00:55.361 --> 00:58.213
Vista ended up being a terrible mess of glitches.

00:58.515 --> 01:01.825
It took Microsoft two years to fix the mess it had made with Windows 7,...

01:02.068 --> 01:05.319
...a product finally good enough to convince most people to move from XP.

01:07.787 --> 01:11.201
In 2012, Microsoft tried to be radical again with Windows 8.

01:11.449 --> 01:14.703
It did away with the traditional desktop and replaced it with tiles,...

01:14.816 --> 01:18.094
...which attempted to bridge PCs, laptops, tablets and smartphones.

01:18.341 --> 01:21.705
Most people were confused and went back to the familiar desktop.

01:22.323 --> 01:23.340
And what about Windows 9?

01:23.833 --> 01:25.091
I don't know, what about it?

01:25.313 --> 01:26.542
Today, we have Windows 10.

01:26.681 --> 01:29.704
It takes us back to the familiar desktop and start menu.

01:29.877 --> 01:31.078
And it's free.

01:31.449 --> 01:35.495
This will also probably be the last time Microsoft puts a number on Windows.

01:36.027 --> 01:40.130
Going forward, Windows will just be Windows.
