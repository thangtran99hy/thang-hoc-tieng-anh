As Amazon celebrates its 20th anniversary,...

00:03.209 --> 00:07.284
...let's take a look at four major challenges it faces on its road ahead.

00:07.779 --> 00:11.882
One: slow international growth particularly in China,...

00:12.079 --> 00:16.865
...where it's failed to make meaningful headway against Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba...

00:17.040 --> 00:18.526
...and other local players.

00:18.875 --> 00:21.139
Two: new challengers in the US,...

00:21.359 --> 00:26.600
...with online marketplace Jet.com offering a variety of products at a discount to members,...

00:26.893 --> 00:31.223
...and Instacart, a direct competitor to Amazon's Prime Fresh service.

00:31.751 --> 00:35.285
Three: the lack of a desirable mobile phone in its portfolio,...

00:35.477 --> 00:39.875
...which leaves it completely dependent on others as more shopping moves to mobile.

00:40.070 --> 00:44.279
And four: the strong chance that brick-and-mortar retailers like Walmart...

00:44.439 --> 00:48.123
...finally develop cohesive and successful e-commerce strategies.

00:48.616 --> 00:51.280
Amazon has been enjoying double-digit revenue growth,...

00:51.466 --> 00:53.692
...but that growth has slowed in recent years.

00:53.866 --> 00:59.073
Its 2010 to 2011 growth of 41% went down to more than half...

00:59.257 --> 01:03.411
...to only 20% growth from 2013 to 2014,...

01:03.641 --> 01:07.289
...suggesting that some of these headwinds may be impacting the company.
