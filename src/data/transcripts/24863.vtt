My name is Erdem.

00:04.519 --> 00:10.442
I am a fashion designer, and we're here at the Marianne North Gallery in Kew Gardens.

00:10.921 --> 00:17.043
And I'm on my way to meet Judd Crane, who is the womenswear director at Selfridges.

00:17.731 --> 00:18.175
Hi Judd.

00:18.271 --> 00:18.904
Hey Erdem.

00:19.369 --> 00:20.174
Glad we could be here today.

00:20.274 --> 00:21.801
Yeah, I'm so excited.

00:21.933 --> 00:24.582
It was very much the starting point for my spring/summer collections.

00:24.741 --> 00:27.560
So I thought it would be a nice place to walk you through my inspiration.

00:27.949 --> 00:28.485
Can we have a look?

00:28.626 --> 00:29.254
Yeah, let's go!

00:30.175 --> 00:35.080
I really, if I'm being totally honest, looked more at the actual botanical studies...

00:35.227 --> 00:36.451
...towards the very end of the collection.

00:36.539 --> 00:40.012
The starting point was really this idea of this woman and who she was,...

00:40.108 --> 00:46.505
...and this idea of this strong, independent person who had a great sense of adventure,...

00:46.611 --> 00:50.079
...and also this idea of something becoming quite undone.

00:50.171 --> 00:54.415
I loved the idea of Victorian strictness,...

00:54.500 --> 00:58.094
...and there's certainly a kind of buttoned-upness to the collection.

00:58.451 --> 01:01.730
But then also contracted with something that feels really kind of undone,...

01:01.852 --> 01:06.581
...and she became more and more wild as the show progressed.
