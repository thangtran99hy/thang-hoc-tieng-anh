00:00.596 --> 00:02.326
We know customers like low prices.

00:02.452 --> 00:04.558
We know customers like big selection.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.905
And we know that customers like fast delivery.

00:07.961 --> 00:09.891
And those things are gonna be true ten years from now.

00:09.993 --> 00:11.345
They're gonna be true 20 years from now,...

00:11.412 --> 00:13.987
...so we can count on those things and we can put energy into them.

00:14.116 --> 00:16.796
We know customers like their products fast.

00:16.913 --> 00:19.787
And so we work on things that we know customers like.

00:19.902 --> 00:22.818
What has worked at Amazon is focusing on the customer,...

00:24.293 --> 00:27.359
...putting the customer first which is easy to say but difficult to do.

00:27.837 --> 00:31.045
If you really are customer-centric, it's like being the host of a party.

00:31.460 --> 00:33.200
You're holding the party for your guest.

00:33.862 --> 00:37.217
Sometimes the host of the party is holding the party for the host of the party...

00:38.164 --> 00:40.400
...and that leads to a different kind of party.
