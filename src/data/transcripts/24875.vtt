Six-year-old Jaden Hayes is counting on making you smile,...

00:03.883 --> 00:06.686
...and then counting every smile he collects.

00:08.546 --> 00:12.336
And taking pictures and documenting his smile experiment.

00:12.432 --> 00:13.727
Can I get a hug, too?

00:16.022 --> 00:16.989
Thank you.

00:17.093 --> 00:17.698
You're welcome.

00:19.205 --> 00:23.241
Everyone: from shop owners to tourists, even TV news anchors.

00:23.799 --> 00:26.721
How big of a smile does that give you when you make other people smile?

00:28.081 --> 00:32.756
Well, it makes me kind of really proud.

00:33.227 --> 00:35.431
And I like it when people smile.

00:35.535 --> 00:39.610
But behind this little boy's grin is a very painful story.

00:40.005 --> 00:41.661
He lost his father two years ago.

00:42.117 --> 00:44.847
And last Sunday, Jaden's mom put him to bed.

00:45.283 --> 00:48.324
Both went to sleep, but she never woke up.

00:49.014 --> 00:51.374
Now this little boy who's feeling such a loss,...

00:51.445 --> 00:55.804
...is pulling his aunt in the summer heat in Savannah to spread some sunshine.

00:55.951 --> 01:00.161
He was tired of seeing frowning, craggy faces.

01:00.281 --> 01:01.063
Here, ma'am.

01:01.445 --> 01:02.760
You did a good job!

01:02.930 --> 01:05.949
Little Jaden is trying to be someone else's sunshine,...

01:06.239 --> 01:08.004
...being the reason they smile.

01:08.147 --> 01:11.596
Why is a smile a good thing to see?
