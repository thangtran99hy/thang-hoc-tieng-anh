One of the things you've done so well at Amazon is you've undercut all of your rivals...

00:04.988 --> 00:05.965
...by keeping the prices low.

00:06.360 --> 00:08.443
Does that same strategy apply to tablets?

00:08.737 --> 00:12.293
Yes, our approach is premium products at nonpremium prices.

00:12.361 --> 00:15.679
So, we sell the hardware at break-even.

00:15.781 --> 00:18.235
So we don't try to make any money when we sell this hardware.

00:18.505 --> 00:22.516
And we hope to make money when people use the devices, not when they buy the devices.

00:23.039 --> 00:26.319
And so that's a very different approach from most companies.

00:26.772 --> 00:30.576
Most companies are building quite a bit of profit into the sale of these devices.
