My hobby is to invent stuff and I do a lot of stuff.

00:06.400 --> 00:12.497
For example, inventing this type of stuff, right here, transformers.

00:12.713 --> 00:15.741
You get what I'm trying to say here, but I made a clock.

00:16.112 --> 00:16.745
That was really easy.

00:16.812 --> 00:18.873
I want to show her something small at first.

00:19.350 --> 00:21.297
But it took a wrong point, and when they saw it was a bomb,...

00:21.365 --> 00:23.288
...so I got arrested for a hoax bomb.

00:24.681 --> 00:27.050
An officer and the principal came and took me up,...

00:27.585 --> 00:31.308
...and they took me to a room filled with five officers, which they interrogated me.

00:31.722 --> 00:34.638
And searched through my stuff and took my tablet and my invention.

00:35.099 --> 00:40.403
And then later that day, I was taken to a Juvenile Center detention center,...

00:40.955 --> 00:42.889
...where they searched me, they took a fingerprint.

00:43.170 --> 00:46.599
No, I never said anything about... I have a bomb, never.

00:47.377 --> 00:49.409
It made me feel like I wasn't human.

00:50.013 --> 00:51.180
It made me feel like a criminal.
