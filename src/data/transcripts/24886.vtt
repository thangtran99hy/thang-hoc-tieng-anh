Mark Zuckerberg has finally announced that the homies over at Facebook...

00:03.813 --> 00:06.852
...have indeed been working on a dislike button.

00:07.027 --> 00:09.396
He cited events like the recent refugee crisis...

00:09.465 --> 00:12.425
...or posts that users make about family members who have passed away...

00:12.529 --> 00:15.669
...to give examples of incidents where friends want to show that they care,...

00:15.799 --> 00:17.967
...but it's not like they "like" what is going on.

00:18.099 --> 00:19.434
Instead of showing disapproval,...

00:19.507 --> 00:22.051
...the dislike button will be more like saying "I'm sorry".
