00:01.222 --> 00:04.301
So, did you ever end up hooking up with Jean?

00:04.678 --> 00:05.822
Oh yeah, you know it, bub.

00:06.307 --> 00:07.455
She is a fiery one.

00:07.752 --> 00:08.534
Oh, good for you.

00:08.899 --> 00:09.453
Good for you.

00:09.545 --> 00:10.182
Good for me.

00:10.284 --> 00:12.003
I've always liked the idea of you two together.

00:12.715 --> 00:13.906
How's your Aunt May doing?

00:14.392 --> 00:15.470
She is good.

00:15.709 --> 00:19.559
She just got a new sewing kit and it's awesome.

00:20.138 --> 00:24.782
I heard that Bruce Banner is having some marital issues with Betty, which is too bad.

00:24.860 --> 00:25.565
And I don't really know how to...

00:25.701 --> 00:26.390
How's it going, troops?

00:26.984 --> 00:27.705
Hey, Cap!

00:28.335 --> 00:29.587
Not another boy scout.

00:29.751 --> 00:30.829
Hey Steve, how's it going?

00:31.128 --> 00:32.377
I feel pretty good, how about you, Peter?

00:32.875 --> 00:34.575
It's going good, glad to have you here.

00:34.703 --> 00:35.364
How's school going?

00:35.632 --> 00:36.590
It's wonderful.

00:36.685 --> 00:38.610
Oh god, kill me now!

00:38.921 --> 00:42.126
For my own curiosity, both of you have fought in the war.

00:42.504 --> 00:44.647
Which wars have you guys fought in before?

00:45.053 --> 00:45.567
Civil.

00:46.389 --> 00:48.082
The greatest war ever: World War II.

00:49.215 --> 00:50.058
That's cute.
