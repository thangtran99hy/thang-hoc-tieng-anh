Tea is an integral part of the Turkish breakfast ritual.

00:13.708 --> 00:15.709

00:16.234 --> 00:19.939
Actually, they drink more tea than any nation in the world.

00:22.447 --> 00:24.401
Tea is made in a two-piece pot.

00:24.801 --> 00:26.405
Boiled water from the lower pot...

00:26.539 --> 00:29.213
...is added to the upper pot with tea leaves to brew.
