So this is all new to me, you know.

00:03.409 --> 00:06.614
To step onto a film set like this is very daunting...

00:06.766 --> 00:11.095
...you know, because it's not my area of expertise.

00:11.189 --> 00:13.229
That probably was the most challenging part for me.

00:14.655 --> 00:17.593
I was nervous but they've been incredible.

00:17.817 --> 00:21.151
They've made me feel very welcomed and I'm very comfortable.

00:21.863 --> 00:23.507
I think I've done okay.

00:26.895 --> 00:32.249
To be able to walk on a set and see Harvey, to see Katherine and then to see Cathy,...

00:32.560 --> 00:35.267
...they've all been part of movies that I've loved over the years,...

00:35.337 --> 00:38.466
...so to actually work with them was a huge honor.

00:39.927 --> 00:43.392
My lasting memories have to be working with a great team.

00:43.767 --> 00:45.450
Everyone on set has been incredible.

00:46.112 --> 00:49.991
Just being here with everyone and being part of this, it's been a great memory.
