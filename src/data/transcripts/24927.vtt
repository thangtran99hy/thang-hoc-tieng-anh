Not long ago, in a galaxy not so far away, Star Wars toys were just lifeless plastic.

00:06.189 --> 00:09.609
Enter BB-8, the new real-life Star Wars droid...

00:09.765 --> 00:12.389
...who rolls around your house like the sidekick you always wanted.

00:12.931 --> 00:16.073
BB-8 is the spiritual successor to our beloved R2-D2,...

00:16.339 --> 00:20.585
...and will make his big screen debut in the coming Star Wars movie "The Force Awakens."

00:21.249 --> 00:22.465
Just like the Hollywood version,...

00:22.649 --> 00:27.372
...the 150-dollar take-home BB-8 boops and bops around with this mushroom-shaped head...

00:27.464 --> 00:28.926
...that magically stays on top.

00:29.315 --> 00:31.768
Made by a toy robot startup called "Sphero,"...

00:31.971 --> 00:34.595
...BB-8 takes commands via Bluetooth from your smartphone.

00:35.059 --> 00:38.821
It's like a little remote control car you can drive around or send off on patrol.

00:39.577 --> 00:41.005
Watch him react to your voice.

00:41.344 --> 00:42.033
It's a trap!

00:42.560 --> 00:43.307
Look around.

00:43.910 --> 00:45.857
He can even beam holographic messages...

00:45.936 --> 00:49.214
...via augmented reality visualizations on your phone screen.

00:49.457 --> 00:52.308
The Incom T-70 X-Wing fighter.

00:52.615 --> 00:54.954
BB-8's personality comes from this little head.

00:55.841 --> 00:59.433
As he bobs, twists and at times drunkenly struggles to keep upright,...

00:59.678 --> 01:01.221
...it's hard not to fall in love.

01:01.661 --> 01:03.375
If you do manage to knock off his head,...

01:03.625 --> 01:08.082
...thankfully it pops back on with the force of magnetism.
