00:01.313 --> 00:05.789
And I tried hard to be proud of my service but all I could feel was shame.

00:06.493 --> 00:09.325
And racism could no longer mask the reality of the occupation.

00:09.437 --> 00:10.197
These were people.

00:10.462 --> 00:11.681
These were human beings.

00:12.069 --> 00:15.013
I've since been plagued by guilt anytime I see an elderly man,...

00:15.307 --> 00:18.272
...like the one who couldn't walk, who we rolled onto a stretcher,...

00:18.417 --> 00:20.217
...and told the Iraqi police to take him away.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.941
I feel guilt anytime I see a mother with her children,...

00:23.346 --> 00:26.777
...like the one who cried hysterically and screamed that we were worse than Saddam...

00:26.880 --> 00:28.169
...as we forced her from her home.

00:28.813 --> 00:30.840
I feel guilt anytime I see a young girl...

00:31.579 --> 00:34.526
...like the one I grabbed by the arm and dragged into the street.

00:35.783 --> 00:37.479
We were told we were fighting terrorists,...

00:38.213 --> 00:41.868
...but the real terrorist was me and the real terrorism is this occupation.

00:43.135 --> 00:46.122
Racism within the military has long been an important tool...

00:46.215 --> 00:49.166
...to justify the destruction and occupation of another country.

00:49.603 --> 00:53.820
It has long been used to justify the killing, subjugation and torture of another people.

00:54.391 --> 00:57.158
Racism is a vital weapon employed by this government.

00:57.681 --> 01:02.296
It is a more important weapon than a rifle, a tank, a bomber or a battleship.

01:02.543 --> 01:07.613
It is more destructive than an artillery shell or a bunker buster or a Tomahawk missile.
