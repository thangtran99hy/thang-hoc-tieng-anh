Thanks everyone, for being here.

00:14.874 --> 00:16.258
My name is Mike Prysner.

00:17.595 --> 00:20.525
I'm a co-founder of an organization of soldiers,...

00:20.764 --> 00:23.440
...active duty soldiers and veterans called March Forward...

00:23.561 --> 00:26.543
...and I'm also a former member of the US army...

00:26.659 --> 00:30.790
...and deployed to Iraq in March of 2003 as a part of the initial invasion...

00:32.336 --> 00:33.618
...when I was 19 years old.

00:33.889 --> 00:38.247
And I think the pictures we saw moments ago...

00:38.945 --> 00:43.817
...kind of speak for me, going to Iraq in 2003,...

00:43.915 --> 00:46.997
...believing what I was told that we're going to help the Iraqi people...

00:47.109 --> 00:51.155
...to bring them a better life, to defend our friends and family back at home.

00:51.523 --> 00:54.494
It took 12 months occupying that country,...

00:54.601 --> 01:00.525
...of seeing young children crying hysterically as we ripped them from their homes,...

01:00.777 --> 01:04.863
...of seeing a man shot through the neck,...

01:05.000 --> 01:08.421
...brought to a prison cell instead of being brought to a hospital,...

01:08.593 --> 01:11.403
...seeing men sob uncontrollably and...

01:11.528 --> 01:15.245
...urinate themselves in detention facilities during interrogation.

01:15.487 --> 01:17.073
All of that pain and suffering...

01:17.491 --> 01:22.661
...made me see that there is no way in hell that this was a war of liberation.

01:23.216 --> 01:24.402
This was something else.

01:25.129 --> 01:30.169
And what I was a part of was defined at the Nuremberg trials...

01:30.652 --> 01:33.075
...as the most supreme crime against humanity.

01:33.608 --> 01:37.654
And that's the illegal war of aggression against a sovereign nation.
