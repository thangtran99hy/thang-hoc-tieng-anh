ï»¿Hello Caroline, I'm Guy.

00:02.934 --> 00:05.673
It's nice to finally meet you in person after talking on the phone.

00:06.383 --> 00:07.927
It's a pleasure to meet you too.

00:08.149 --> 00:09.531
I hope business is going well?

00:10.367 --> 00:14.298
Yes, we have several new products in the pipeline, so it's pretty hectic.

00:15.352 --> 00:16.565
Before we go any further,...

00:16.845 --> 00:19.337
...I'd like you to meet Christina Pyle from our legal department.

00:20.159 --> 00:21.737
She's going to be part of today's discussion...

00:21.816 --> 00:24.071
...on revising the licensing agreement with your company.

00:24.887 --> 00:26.403
Good to meet you, Ms. Pyle.

00:26.904 --> 00:28.177
I've asked Christina to join us...

00:28.374 --> 00:30.707
...so that she can approve any amendments to the agreement.

00:31.176 --> 00:33.837
We want to make sure the changes do not conflict with our interests.

00:34.659 --> 00:37.965
From our perspective, there are a few points of concern,...

00:38.284 --> 00:42.085
...but I'm confident we can work out a new agreement that suits both parties.
