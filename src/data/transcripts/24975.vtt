00:01.622 --> 00:06.003
The first ever atomic bomb to be used in war was dropped here on the city of Hiroshima...

00:06.083 --> 00:08.121
...on the 6th of August 1945.

00:08.512 --> 00:11.118
Well over 100,000 citizens were killed.

00:11.377 --> 00:14.145
Those in the hypocenter were instantly turned into dust,...

00:14.451 --> 00:17.977
...while countless others died from the burns and high dose of radiation they received.

00:21.391 --> 00:25.423
Over 50,000 survivors or "hibakusha" still live in the city.

00:25.933 --> 00:29.298
Each one of them has their own story to tell of the day the bomb fell.

00:29.699 --> 00:31.296
And I was on my way to meet one.
