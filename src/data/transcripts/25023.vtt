00:03.668 --> 00:07.460
What if the computer was a beautiful object,...

00:08.209 --> 00:10.358
...something you wanna look at and have in your home?

00:10.905 --> 00:14.700
And what if, instead of it being in the right hands,...

00:15.427 --> 00:16.734
...it was in everyone's hands?

00:17.739 --> 00:21.631
We'd be talking about the most tectonic shift in the status quo since...

00:21.806 --> 00:22.227
Ever.

00:22.479 --> 00:26.767
We will know soon enough if you are Leonardo da Vinci or just think you are.

00:27.529 --> 00:29.534
You're the only one who sees the world same way I do.

00:30.503 --> 00:32.341
No one sees the world the same way you do.

00:33.227 --> 00:35.403
You're issuing contradictory instructions,...

00:35.822 --> 00:38.701
...you're insubordinate, you make people miserable.

00:39.228 --> 00:42.121
The board believes you're no longer necessary to this company.

00:42.356 --> 00:43.749
A comeback of a superstar.

00:43.874 --> 00:45.255
Co-founder Steven Jobs...

00:45.957 --> 00:48.362
Steve Jobs is returning to Apple.

00:50.757 --> 00:53.255
Two most significant events of the 20th century:...

00:53.685 --> 00:55.693
...the Allies win the war and this.

00:56.053 --> 01:00.357
Ladies and gentlemen, Steve Jobs.
