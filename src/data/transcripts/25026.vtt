It was my dream to be able to produce an adorable bobtail cat...

00:03.961 --> 00:05.452
...that everyone would be able to enjoy.

00:05.761 --> 00:07.980
April Arguin of Jacksonville, Florida...

00:08.100 --> 00:11.238
...has successfully introduced two new cat breeds to the world:...

00:11.611 --> 00:14.659
...the SphynxieBob and the BamBob.

00:14.823 --> 00:20.955
The SphynxieBob looks identical to a regular Sphynx, has the gorgeous, big, round ears,...

00:21.065 --> 00:22.445
...and the hairless features.

00:22.553 --> 00:27.507
The only difference that makes them superior and unique is the short, little bobtail.

00:31.611 --> 00:35.941
The unique feature of the BamBob is they're identical to the Bambino cat,...

00:36.007 --> 00:39.233
...which is a hairless cat that carries the gene for short legs.

00:39.473 --> 00:43.843
...so they have the same awesome look and short, cute little swagger...

00:43.999 --> 00:45.629
...but they have a short bobtail.

00:45.817 --> 00:47.352
You are the world's first ever!

00:49.817 --> 00:51.070
It's definitely a passion.

00:51.143 --> 00:55.569
It's not a business or something I do with the goal or intention to make money.

00:55.941 --> 00:58.425
We do this for the betterment of the breed,...

00:58.562 --> 01:02.053
...and really just the passion of sharing these amazing creatures with the world.
