00:04.389 --> 00:08.875
Imagine what it would be like if you left the Earth for an entire year.

00:10.646 --> 00:15.039
Away from your friends, your family, everything you love and care about.

00:17.228 --> 00:21.125
Two of Earth's bravest are making that sacrifice right now.

00:22.373 --> 00:26.476
They've traveled beyond our atmosphere for a yearlong stay...

00:26.615 --> 00:29.036
...aboard the International Space Station.

00:30.319 --> 00:34.673
Here they'll study the effects of prolonged weightlessness on the human body.

00:35.711 --> 00:41.685
Their discoveries will allow humans to travel farther into space than ever before.

00:42.409 --> 00:45.876
The conditions are harsh, the risk is great,...

00:46.439 --> 00:50.237
...but the potential payoff is huge.

00:50.841 --> 00:54.129
We could stay on Earth, but that's not who we are.

00:54.923 --> 00:57.929
We're scientists and we're explorers.

00:58.522 --> 01:04.003
We'll always venture into the unknown and seek to expand our knowledge.

01:04.826 --> 01:08.804
One day soon, humans will step foot on Mars.

01:09.071 --> 01:14.174
And it's the science being conducted today aboard the International Space Station...

01:14.620 --> 01:16.525
...that will help us get there.

01:17.947 --> 01:21.467
We explore the universe because we must,...

01:22.241 --> 01:28.009
...because humankind's future doesn't belong on Earth alone.
