ï»¿The letter's 20 years old.

00:02.707 --> 00:06.153
After we were married and trying to have children, we couldn't have kids...

00:06.585 --> 00:13.282
...so we adopted a son and then 11 years later, God sent Brooke to us.

00:14.318 --> 00:18.499
Being adopted, I wanted them to know how much I loved her.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.825
And I just thought it would be extremely precious...

00:20.939 --> 00:23.191
...when she opened it up and read it on her wedding day.

00:30.693 --> 00:32.677
This is a piece of my wedding dress.

00:35.824 --> 00:37.260
And it's the letter that I wrote you.

00:38.805 --> 00:41.168
December the 15th, 1994.

00:41.824 --> 00:43.287
Our dear little baby Brooke.

00:43.845 --> 00:47.323
As I write this to you, you're sleeping soundly in your baby bed.

00:48.021 --> 00:52.181
We just want you to know how much love and happiness you brought to our family.

00:52.927 --> 00:57.858
A precious little baby girl to Daddy and me, and a baby sister to Brian.

00:58.750 --> 01:02.770
Before Daddy and I were married, we always said if we had a little girl,...

01:02.933 --> 01:06.845
...she would be our little Brooke and you were our little baby Brooke.
