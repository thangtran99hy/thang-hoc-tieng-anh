00:00.046 --> 00:01.844
So, how is Apple making all of this money?

00:02.038 --> 00:04.737
These figures are such extreme profits for a company...

00:04.818 --> 00:08.650
...that only releases two phones at the same time, once a year.

00:10.201 --> 00:14.838
The reason can mostly be summed up in two words: premium price.

00:15.209 --> 00:17.813
Apple is focused on the high-end premium market,...

00:18.134 --> 00:21.909
...selling their phones at a high price to gain a wider profit margin.

00:22.169 --> 00:26.771
This, coupled with world-class branding, marketing and functional simplicity,...

00:26.975 --> 00:28.637
...make for a deadly combination.

00:29.591 --> 00:33.653
It can be said that a lot of what makes the iPhone so profitable for Apple...

00:33.914 --> 00:38.631
...has more to do with the consumer's mind and what they perceive the iPhone as being,...

00:38.780 --> 00:40.779
...rather than the physical product itself.

00:41.269 --> 00:43.670
Apple's advertising and strong brand...

00:43.743 --> 00:47.375
...also makes iPhones a cultural icon and a status symbol.

00:47.739 --> 00:51.075
An iPhone is instantly recognizable and distinguished...

00:51.171 --> 00:54.475
...from the slew of Windows phones and Android phones out there.
