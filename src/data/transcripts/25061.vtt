Eastern Europe in the 18th century was a pretty grim place,...

00:06.045 --> 00:10.985
...with many deaths occurring from unknown diseases and plagues.

00:11.393 --> 00:15.821
Without medical explanations, people searched for supernatural causes...

00:16.419 --> 00:21.697
...and found what looked like evidence in the corpses of the victims.

00:22.003 --> 00:26.636
When villagers dug up bodies to discern the cause of the mysterious deaths,...

00:27.225 --> 00:31.618
...they would often find the cadavers looking very much alive.

00:32.118 --> 00:39.259
Longer hair and fingernails, bloated bellies, and blood at the corners of mouths.

00:40.105 --> 00:41.789
Grisly stuff!

00:43.116 --> 00:47.561
But what the villagers interpreted as unholy reanimation...

00:48.065 --> 00:51.327
...were actually normal symptoms of death.
