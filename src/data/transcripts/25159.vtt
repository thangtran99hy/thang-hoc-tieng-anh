A great Halloween party is nothing to get spooked about.

00:04.692 --> 00:06.611
Check out these simple ways to trick out your treats...

00:06.709 --> 00:08.297
...and make this year's party memorable.

00:09.511 --> 00:11.063
Halloween calls for cupcakes, right?

00:11.473 --> 00:15.416
Just place some zombie hands on the icing to take them from fun to frightening.

00:16.259 --> 00:17.540
And how about these cookies?

00:17.655 --> 00:19.970
Use cake mix to make them monstrously good.

00:20.328 --> 00:24.489
And add some eerie eyeballs to make them a big hit with boys and ghouls.

00:25.357 --> 00:28.357
Here's how to make your Halloween party punch creepy cool.

00:28.533 --> 00:29.792
Just grab a latex glove.

00:30.050 --> 00:32.557
Make sure it's not the powdered kind and fill it with water.

00:33.434 --> 00:34.030
Freeze it.

00:34.529 --> 00:37.836
Cut away the glove and float it in a bowl of fruit punch.

00:38.511 --> 00:42.410
And that's how to scare up a Halloween party without spending too much time or money.

00:42.729 --> 00:44.617
Your guests are in for a real treat.
