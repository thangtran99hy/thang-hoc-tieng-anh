Nearly two billion people are living without reliable access to power.

00:06.138 --> 00:08.636
When the sun goes down, that's the end of your day.

00:08.816 --> 00:10.433
You're not reading any books.

00:10.593 --> 00:12.322
You're not doing any math problems.

00:12.645 --> 00:16.695
If you think about how many hours a child loses, over the span of a year,...

00:16.911 --> 00:20.667
...and you compare that to the rest of the kids in the world who do have access to power,...

00:20.981 --> 00:24.584
...you start to see how you can be left back on that path...

00:24.928 --> 00:26.783
...towards creating the world that you want.

00:30.308 --> 00:31.210
This is a Soccket.

00:31.559 --> 00:34.184
It looks like a soccer ball, plays a lot like a soccer ball,...

00:34.309 --> 00:35.467
...but it's actually a lot more.

00:36.851 --> 00:40.015
It's an airless ball that generates electricity when you play with it.

00:41.033 --> 00:44.133
Inside the Soccket, there's a pendulum, a generator motor,...

00:44.418 --> 00:46.007
...and a lithium ion rechargeable battery.

00:46.442 --> 00:52.396
When the ball rolls, the pendulum turns the generator that then powers up the battery.

00:53.118 --> 00:59.437
After 30 minutes of play, you can get over three hours of clean, renewable light.

01:01.513 --> 01:05.289
So the idea here is we're providing a platform for play...

01:05.398 --> 01:08.252
...to make the journey towards the solution that much happier.
