With their independently rotating eyes, color change abilities,...

00:08.368 --> 00:12.202
...their pincer-like feet, their long tongue that they project out of their mouth,...

00:12.934 --> 00:14.765
...and their slow, deliberate movements.

00:15.469 --> 00:18.923
Chameleons are animals that most people would regard as highly charismatic.

00:24.793 --> 00:28.027
One of the old theories as to why chameleons change color...

00:28.096 --> 00:30.152
...was that they were changing color to match their background.

00:31.496 --> 00:34.996
But what we now know is that it's actually a communication strategy.

00:36.510 --> 00:41.061
Male-male combat will elicit some of the most impressive colorations from males.

00:41.519 --> 00:44.129
From females, on the other hand, if a female's gravid...

00:44.243 --> 00:46.709
...or she has eggs and is not interested in breeding,...

00:47.133 --> 00:49.704
...if a male starts to try and court her,...

00:49.790 --> 00:52.581
...she will display some very intense, vibrant colorations...

00:52.657 --> 00:54.565
...to let the male know that she's not interested.

00:56.379 --> 00:59.451
Chameleons have fascinated scientists and naturalists for centuries.

00:59.656 --> 01:01.591
It's something that we're still learning a lot about.
