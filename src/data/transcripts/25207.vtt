00:04.960 --> 00:06.579
So, my name is Iain Kerr.

00:06.672 --> 00:08.791
I'm the CEO of Ocean Alliance.

00:09.439 --> 00:14.511
And since 1971, Ocean Alliance has been developing benign research techniques.

00:14.956 --> 00:19.850
These are tools that prove you don't have to kill a whale to learn about whales.

00:20.041 --> 00:25.807
So, what we're trying to do is build a cheap drone that can be used by,...

00:25.917 --> 00:30.701
...let's say, a seasick novice, to collect data from whales.

00:35.444 --> 00:36.195
I'm Matt Rush.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.401
I just graduated from Olin College.

00:38.802 --> 00:42.701
We've been partnering with Ocean Alliance to develop a little air vehicle...

00:42.769 --> 00:45.186
...that can be launched from the boat as soon as the whale is on the surface,...

00:45.569 --> 00:49.052
...fly out to the whale, and then collect all of the blow which isn't water.

00:49.436 --> 00:51.430
It's snot.

00:51.523 --> 00:52.537
It's mucus and lung lining...

00:52.667 --> 00:55.117
...and all sorts of good stuff that Ocean Alliance can get.

00:55.275 --> 01:01.651
Stress hormones and toxins and DNA, all the good stuff that the scientists wanna see.

01:05.388 --> 01:09.252
We live on planet ocean, not on planet Earth.

01:09.487 --> 01:12.413
So, understanding what's going on in our oceans,...

01:12.671 --> 01:17.361
...having these animals show us all the ups and downs, whether it be related to...

01:17.599 --> 01:21.253
...acidification or potentially climate change or pollution,...

01:21.532 --> 01:26.034
...they're a great bioindicator species, and we have a lot to learn from them.
