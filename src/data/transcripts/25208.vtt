Hi! Bill Nye here, explaining evolution with Emoji.

00:05.562 --> 00:08.864
Take a look at this one: it's a molecule, and molecules just happen.

00:08.957 --> 00:09.985
Look at any asteroid.

00:10.070 --> 00:13.231
It's loaded with amino acids: a carbon, an oxygen and an oxygen.

00:13.623 --> 00:19.861
Well somehow, probably with energy from the sun, these molecules hooked together...

00:19.961 --> 00:23.130
...and accidentally found ways to reproduce themselves,...

00:23.235 --> 00:26.452
...the same way crystals reproduce if you leave them alone for a while.

00:26.831 --> 00:32.008
Anyway, these self-replicating molecules could not make perfect copies of themselves...

00:32.096 --> 00:36.723
...and the imperfections that helped them make more copies stayed there,...

00:37.195 --> 00:39.621
...kept getting reproduced and reproduced and reproduced.

00:40.317 --> 00:44.609
And pretty soon, you have complicated things like bacteria...

00:45.156 --> 00:47.384
...and then you've got multiple bacteria,...

00:47.457 --> 00:53.269
...becoming multiple multiple multicellular organisms like poison ivy plants,...

00:53.581 --> 00:58.139
...and barnacles and sea jellies and even my old boss.

00:58.651 --> 01:00.733
And the key to this is time.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.517
Time, time, time.

01:02.883 --> 01:06.004
People used to think the Earth was a few thousand years old,...

01:06.463 --> 01:09.848
...then they realized it was at least a few hundreds of millions of years old.

01:09.931 --> 01:16.825
Well now, using radioactivity, we can tell you that the Earth is 4.54 billion years old.

01:17.446 --> 01:19.846
A lot can happen in four and a half billion years.

01:20.135 --> 01:20.820
Get a mirror.

01:21.052 --> 01:22.140
Take a look at yourself.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.871
We are all the result of evolution.
