If you want to climb the corporate ladder, you'll need connections.

00:06.479 --> 00:10.879
That's why Timmy, Margaret, Jerry and Betty are getting together for a work lunch.

00:11.115 --> 00:12.133
Let's see how it goes.

00:14.851 --> 00:16.045
Not a good start.

00:16.285 --> 00:17.634
Betty is late for lunch.

00:19.145 --> 00:21.677
Timmy, Margaret and Jerry pretend to be okay with it.

00:21.928 --> 00:24.135
But they can barely hide their furious anger.

00:24.417 --> 00:25.923
Their mouths say, "Nice to see you,"...

00:26.203 --> 00:27.837
...but their eyes scream, "Burn in hell."

00:30.213 --> 00:32.924
Look, Timmy ordered a double martini.

00:33.475 --> 00:35.207
He's on his second drink already.

00:35.429 --> 00:36.249
What a lush.

00:36.613 --> 00:38.793
If he doesn't ease up, he'll pass out at the table,...

00:38.898 --> 00:41.540
...which is rarely acceptable at a casual lunch.

00:43.892 --> 00:44.723
Good idea!

00:45.061 --> 00:47.042
Jerry tells a joke to lighten the mood.

00:47.631 --> 00:50.035
Oh Timmy, Jerry's joke isn't that funny.

00:50.318 --> 00:53.498
Timmy's almost pathological laughter is making everyone uncomfortable.

00:54.027 --> 00:56.297
Don't be like Timmy, Margaret, Jerry and Betty.

00:56.429 --> 00:59.429
Work lunch the right way, and you'll be climbing the corporate ladder all the way to the top.
