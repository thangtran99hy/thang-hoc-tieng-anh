00:01.327 --> 00:02.569
Why do we play?

00:03.529 --> 00:08.462
We play for jumpers, passers and shooters.

00:08.775 --> 00:14.546
We play for driveway one-on-ones, playground heroes and the clutch vet at the Y.

00:14.963 --> 00:21.892
We play for ballers, shot callers, game changers, life changers.

00:22.059 --> 00:27.303
We play for the East side, West side, North side and South side.

00:27.909 --> 00:32.495
We play for the drama, the suspense and even the comedy.

00:33.377 --> 00:38.618
We play for comebacks, paybacks and givebacks.

00:39.799 --> 00:44.157
For breaking through, breaking barriers and paradigms.

00:44.657 --> 00:49.293
We play for chasing the dream, on and off the court.

00:49.569 --> 00:52.932
We play for all that and whatever comes.

00:55.677 --> 00:57.675
This is why we play.
