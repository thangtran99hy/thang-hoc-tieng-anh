Like it or not, Facebook's trademark "Like" button is set to get more expressive.

00:06.425 --> 00:08.733
The social network has announced plans...

00:08.827 --> 00:13.186
...to launch a new set of emoticons to replace the traditional button.

00:13.858 --> 00:15.777
The "Reactions" will allow users...

00:15.879 --> 00:21.176
...to express a range of emotions including love, happiness, anger, and sadness.

00:21.483 --> 00:24.164
However, dislike will not be one of them.

00:24.764 --> 00:28.889
It comes after CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was working on...

00:29.004 --> 00:32.197
...adding a button other than "Like" to express empathy.
