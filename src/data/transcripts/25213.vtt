00:02.197 --> 00:03.319
The stage is set.

00:03.777 --> 00:04.781
The curtain rises.

00:06.123 --> 00:07.395
We are ready to begin.

00:13.432 --> 00:15.165
You promised to keep him safe!

00:15.285 --> 00:16.437
You promised!

00:18.483 --> 00:19.151
Well, Holmes?

00:19.841 --> 00:22.132
Surely you must have some theory.

00:22.808 --> 00:24.985
We all have a past, Watson. Ghosts.

00:25.278 --> 00:27.902
They are the shadows that define our every sunny day.

00:31.306 --> 00:32.825
Every great cause has martyrs.

00:35.131 --> 00:39.014
Every war has suicide missions, and make no mistake, this is war.

00:39.145 --> 00:40.011
Why are you doing this?

00:40.253 --> 00:41.227
Tell me who you are!

00:41.615 --> 00:42.820
What made you like this?

00:43.083 --> 00:47.017
Oh Watson, nothing made me.

00:49.992 --> 00:50.898
I made me.

00:51.374 --> 00:52.103
Who are you?

00:53.209 --> 00:55.150
I demand you speak, who are you?

00:56.228 --> 01:01.727
The name is Sherlock Holmes, and the address is 221B Baker Street.
