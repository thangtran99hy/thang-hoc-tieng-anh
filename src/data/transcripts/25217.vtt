Every day we experience the world through touch.

00:04.327 --> 00:05.706
It saves us time in the morning.

00:06.799 --> 00:09.001
It's how we use most of our technology.

00:09.669 --> 00:14.639
And it comes to us naturally even if it's just to play or explore.

00:15.873 --> 00:20.212
Touch removes barriers and allows us to truly interact.

00:21.743 --> 00:24.691
So, why do these barriers exist in the classroom?

00:25.330 --> 00:27.336
A pen can be a great tool,...

00:29.281 --> 00:32.521
...but it doesn't allow you to truly interact with content.

00:34.256 --> 00:37.311
Only a touch-enabled interactive projector can.

00:39.037 --> 00:43.805
Introducing the world's first touch-enabled Interactive Projector.
