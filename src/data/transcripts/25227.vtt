Dear kitten, I need to give you a little history lesson.

00:04.606 --> 00:08.333
Hundreds of thousands of years ago, we cats were given a choice.

00:09.075 --> 00:12.926
Either we could learn the art of swimming and become a seafaring creature,...

00:13.160 --> 00:16.638
...or we could choose the gift of the art of massage.

00:17.283 --> 00:20.578
I think it's obvious which one we chose: massage.

00:21.139 --> 00:25.493
To this day, we must exercise our duty to massage everything.

00:26.007 --> 00:30.030
We alone can exercise this alternating gentle touch...

00:30.221 --> 00:33.093
...with a little aftertaste of claws digging in the flesh.

00:33.386 --> 00:36.377
It is a reminder that all joy is birthed from pain.

00:36.641 --> 00:39.045
And that all love will end in bloodshed.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.666
Actually, I don't know if I agree with that last part.

00:41.789 --> 00:43.475
But, you know, I was on a roll.

00:44.531 --> 00:45.544
It sounded good.

00:45.898 --> 00:47.825
I mean, I guess one way of thinking about it is that...

00:48.400 --> 00:53.167
...a good massage is like a very very slow fight that you're winning.

00:54.015 --> 00:56.773
It's like that mixture of loving something,...

00:57.009 --> 01:01.913
...but then also wanting to check if it's still alive by clawing it.

01:02.419 --> 01:06.091
From time to time, you may need to teach the humans about massage.

01:06.303 --> 01:08.943
I mean, if it's all just "touchy touchy, rub my tummy"...

01:09.170 --> 01:11.547
...and no pain, you have to bite them.

01:11.945 --> 01:13.496
It's kind of a yin and yang thing.

01:13.665 --> 01:15.525
It restores balance to the universe.
