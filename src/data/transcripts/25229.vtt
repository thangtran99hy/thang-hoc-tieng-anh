"The Science of Us" presents "The Positives of Negative Thinking."

00:05.141 --> 00:08.019
Everywhere you look, people are urging you to be positive.

00:08.359 --> 00:10.955
Telling you that you're more likely to achieve your goals...

00:11.031 --> 00:13.308
...if you think you're definitely going to achieve them.

00:13.427 --> 00:15.774
But here's a surprise in scientific finding.

00:16.042 --> 00:21.578
Optimism can actually hold you back, and a little bit of pessimism can be a big help.

00:22.128 --> 00:24.884
That idea comes from the work of Gabriele Oettingen,...

00:25.075 --> 00:28.943
...a German psychologist who's been studying optimism since the 1980s.

00:29.729 --> 00:33.606
In 1991, she studied a group of women in a weight loss program.

00:33.889 --> 00:37.669
Before the program began, she asked them to predict how well they'd do...

00:37.853 --> 00:41.765
...and she was shocked to find that the women who were pessimistic about losing weight,...

00:41.918 --> 00:45.460
...who thought the process would be difficult and that they might not succeed,...

00:45.817 --> 00:50.624
...actually ended up losing an average of 24 more pounds than the positive thinkers.

00:51.351 --> 00:54.421
Over and over again, she found that positive fantasies...

00:54.548 --> 00:56.477
...didn't help people achieve their goals.

00:56.649 --> 00:58.449
And in fact, often got in the way.

00:58.793 --> 01:00.227
Here's her theory about why.

01:00.644 --> 01:03.844
When you indulge in starry-eyed dreaming about the future,...

01:04.123 --> 01:06.241
...you start ignoring the tasks in front of you.

01:06.605 --> 01:09.839
Instead of pushing yourself to go to the gym or study for a test,...

01:10.211 --> 01:13.743
...you just happily imagine having big muscles or good grades,...

01:13.911 --> 01:16.143
...and don't feel much motivation to get to work.
