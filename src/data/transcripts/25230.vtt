00:00.626 --> 00:01.445
Is it over here?

00:02.078 --> 00:02.890
How about over here?

00:03.856 --> 00:04.077
Here!

00:04.427 --> 00:05.199
How about over here?

00:05.569 --> 00:06.101
It's here?

00:06.389 --> 00:07.647
Are you sure it's that one?

00:08.196 --> 00:08.920
Are you sure?

00:09.345 --> 00:15.838
Even in a small amount of disease in a bee colony, Klinker's gonna detect that...

00:16.188 --> 00:19.432
...long before a human would ever detect it.

00:22.904 --> 00:28.469
Klinker inspects bees for the odor of American foulbrood.

00:28.755 --> 00:31.871
It's a very contagious disease that bees get.

00:35.309 --> 00:40.501
Klinker is the only certified dog in the continental United States,...

00:40.623 --> 00:47.646
...probably Alaska and Hawaii, that is certified to detect American foulbrood.

00:51.014 --> 00:55.878
The Maryland Department of Agriculture has had a dog program since '82.

00:56.231 --> 00:59.203
We know the effectiveness of it.

00:59.417 --> 01:03.519
We certainly are going to try to employ more dogs throughout the state...

01:03.755 --> 01:05.270
...to help us be more efficient.

01:05.466 --> 01:06.603
We're gonna go to the next place.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.487
We're gonna go to the next bee yard.

01:10.164 --> 01:11.169
Okay, good girl.

01:11.437 --> 01:13.229
Good job, good job, Klinker.

01:13.767 --> 01:14.567
Good job, yeah.

01:15.007 --> 01:15.820
You did good, girl.
