Now I'm gonna show you the right way to eat sushi, which begins at the sushi bar...

00:06.729 --> 00:10.092
...where you can sit and interact with the chef and ask him what's good to eat.

00:19.539 --> 00:22.269
Once you've found the sushi bar you like, don't order rolls.

00:22.577 --> 00:26.231
Ask for "nigiri", the hand-squeezed rectangles of fish and rice.

00:26.543 --> 00:27.580
That's real sushi.

00:27.874 --> 00:30.245
The chef will serve it to you on a small plate...

00:30.421 --> 00:34.043
...where you can pick it up with your fingers and put it directly in your mouth.

00:34.228 --> 00:37.609
Good sushi should be packed nice and loose...

00:37.873 --> 00:40.388
...so it falls apart on your tongue when you eat it.

00:40.666 --> 00:45.460
The best sushi chefs will season all the sushi for you before they serve it to you.

00:45.691 --> 00:49.101
You don't need to add extra soy sauce or anything else.

00:49.249 --> 00:52.378
Sometimes, a chef might serve it to you without seasoning,...

00:52.668 --> 00:56.997
...in which case, you can dip a corner of sushi in a little bit of sauce.

00:57.308 --> 01:03.180
The ginger is there as a palate cleanser to be eaten between each piece of sushi.

01:03.384 --> 01:04.877
You can eat it with your chopsticks.
