Some people may long to wipe the boss out of their lives in a heartbeat...

00:05.277 --> 00:09.249
...as Jonah Hill did as Donnie Azoff in "The Wolf of Wall Street."

00:09.487 --> 00:11.723
He literally phones in his resignation.

00:11.849 --> 00:12.938
Hey Paulie, what's up?

00:13.808 --> 00:15.139
No, everything's fine.

00:15.340 --> 00:16.314
Hey listen, I quit!

00:16.807 --> 00:18.666
Don't come looking for a reference from me.

00:19.149 --> 00:20.659
Okay, I won't.

00:21.644 --> 00:27.136
In most real-life situations, however, making such an outburst doesn't pay off.

00:27.349 --> 00:31.062
One of the best known illustrations is Tom Cruise's departure scene...

00:31.332 --> 00:34.013
...in the 1996 film "Jerry Maguire."

00:34.449 --> 00:37.626
If anybody else wants to come with me,...

00:38.787 --> 00:44.289
...this moment will be the moment of something real and fun...

00:44.797 --> 00:50.541
...and inspiring in this godforsaken business, and we will do it together.

00:53.722 --> 00:54.474
Who's coming with me?

00:55.907 --> 00:56.670
Who's coming with me?

00:58.526 --> 00:59.411
Who's coming with me?

00:59.803 --> 01:03.085
After the spectacle is over, bosses and former colleagues...

01:03.427 --> 01:07.289
...can hurt your reputation through gossip or bad references.

01:08.098 --> 01:08.973
The bottom line?

01:09.137 --> 01:12.540
Leave your ex-employer with nothing to use against you.

01:12.975 --> 01:17.719
Make goodwill the goal and leave drama to the movies.
