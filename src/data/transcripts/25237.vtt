See that cute little dog in the pet store window?

00:03.089 --> 00:05.220
Chances are it came from a puppy mill,...

00:06.160 --> 00:10.539
...a breeding facility that forces caged, neglected, and often sick dogs...

00:10.638 --> 00:13.888
...to churn out puppy after puppy to be sold for profit.

00:14.297 --> 00:16.343
That's how nearly all pet stores work.

00:16.860 --> 00:20.632
Meanwhile, millions of wonderful healthy pets end up in animal shelters...

00:20.720 --> 00:24.355
...because of divorce, money trouble, or simply not having a home.

00:24.906 --> 00:28.248
Animal shelters are full of amazing pets looking for a home.

00:28.567 --> 00:32.197
Mixed, pure breed, big or small, puppies to adults,...

00:32.709 --> 00:35.340
...you can find that faithful companion you've always wanted.

00:36.041 --> 00:40.401
A fluffy snuggler, your new hiking buddy, or even one that looks good in hats.

00:40.967 --> 00:44.287
When you adopt your new best friend, not only are you saving a life,...

00:44.413 --> 00:46.495
...you're taking a stand against puppy mills.
