My name is Mihir.

00:05.444 --> 00:09.449
I'm 15 years old, and I'm a sophomore at Fox Chapel Area High School in Pittsburgh.

00:10.240 --> 00:13.243
I started visiting the Carnegie Science Center from an early age.

00:13.831 --> 00:15.856
It's full of fun and interactive exhibits,...

00:16.063 --> 00:19.363
...which helped spark my interest in science and develop a love for robotics.

00:20.197 --> 00:23.029
Last summer, my family and I went to India on vacation.

00:24.611 --> 00:26.838
We returned to find our house filled with fruit flies,...

00:27.160 --> 00:29.383
...as we had left some bananas on the kitchen counter.

00:29.841 --> 00:31.940
After many failed attempts trying to swat them,...

00:32.210 --> 00:34.811
...I started to realize how amazing the fruit fly's escape is.

00:35.701 --> 00:39.354
I had been reading about flying robots at the time, and one thing that struck me...

00:39.517 --> 00:42.451
...was the similarities in the environments in which both fruit flies...

00:42.573 --> 00:44.193
...and flying robots have to operate.

00:45.279 --> 00:47.372
I wanted to see whether we could draw from biology...

00:47.543 --> 00:49.401
...to make flying robots truly autonomous,...

00:49.705 --> 00:52.914
...so they could potentially be used in robot-assisted rescue missions...

00:53.061 --> 00:54.771
...in environments like collapsed buildings.

00:55.284 --> 00:58.035
I wanted to apply my learnings from fruit fly escape behaviors...

00:58.187 --> 00:59.877
...to a multirotor helicopter.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.388
I used a sheet of plywood to simulate an approaching threat...

01:02.569 --> 01:03.679
...while testing different algorithms.

01:04.328 --> 01:06.849
And I was really excited when my robot managed to escape...

01:07.120 --> 01:10.071
...with a success rate of a hundred percent across 20 attempts.

01:10.392 --> 01:12.373
I'm really optimistic about the world of tomorrow.

01:12.709 --> 01:14.477
I want to save lives with flying robots...

01:14.780 --> 01:17.561
...and use computer science and robotics to make a difference.

01:18.090 --> 01:19.777
This is a world that I'd like to be a part of,...

01:20.095 --> 01:22.621
...but more importantly, one that I'd like to help create.
