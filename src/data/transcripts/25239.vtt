Festival tip number 805: There will be mud.

00:09.633 --> 00:11.291
It's really, really beautiful from up here.

00:11.463 --> 00:14.373
I'm gonna show you how you can take an incredible photo using the rule of thirds.

00:16.141 --> 00:19.881
So essentially, the rule of thirds means you're putting your subject in the third of the screen.

00:20.410 --> 00:23.218
It creates a way more dramatic sense of mood.

00:23.466 --> 00:27.704
I know you wanna take a photo like this and put them in the entire frame,...

00:27.953 --> 00:32.335
...but you're gonna bring it back, you're gonna use these amazing grid lines here...

00:32.484 --> 00:33.965
...to line up their eyes.

00:34.457 --> 00:38.084
This way I can see the bridge, and I'm gonna line the top line up with the bridge.

00:38.179 --> 00:40.633
Now we have her in three of the boxes.

00:41.902 --> 00:42.329
Perfect!

00:42.501 --> 00:44.597
Let's see which one I like the best for Instagram.

00:44.887 --> 00:45.570
These are all cute.

00:45.666 --> 00:47.101
Oh, that is definitely the one.

00:47.783 --> 00:48.383
Bring it in.

00:48.621 --> 00:51.669
I think I'm gonna make this black-and-white to make it even more dramatic.

00:52.664 --> 00:53.971
Actually, I like this black and white.

00:54.131 --> 00:54.485
Perfect!

00:57.431 --> 00:59.167
Rule of thirds works every time.
