00:03.039 --> 00:05.465
Robots seem magical at times.

00:07.281 --> 00:10.444
They can move and act as if they have a life of their own.

00:11.748 --> 00:15.725
In movies like "Star Wars," they seem almost human.

00:18.103 --> 00:22.256
But in reality, everything a robot does is programmed in advance by the engineers...

00:22.355 --> 00:24.223
...who created it.

00:25.979 --> 00:29.879
Chad Jenkins of Brown University explains that useful robots...

00:30.059 --> 00:33.147
...must be able to sense, plan and act.

00:33.536 --> 00:36.715
We have to have robots that can sense and perceive the world,...

00:37.116 --> 00:39.730
...that can make decisions that will lead them to a goal,...

00:40.038 --> 00:42.989
...and then be able to act in a way that's going to perform that plan.

00:44.533 --> 00:48.985
By sensing, the robot takes in information from the world around it.

00:49.329 --> 00:52.767
They have to be able to perceive all of those things that we take for granted as humans.

00:52.889 --> 00:55.565
Being able to recognize a variety of different objects.

00:57.632 --> 01:00.729
Once the robot has gathered information from its senses,...

01:00.915 --> 01:04.461
...it needs to analyze that data in its onboard computer...

01:04.884 --> 01:06.489
...and plan a response.

01:07.667 --> 01:13.651
Finally, once it's sensed the situation and planned a response, the robot needs to act.

01:14.552 --> 01:19.105
We essentially are sending commands to the motors of the robot, and the robot is executing that.

01:20.139 --> 01:25.251
Variations of this sense, plan, act paradigm power many modern robots.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.933
And this loop goes around over and over and over,...

01:28.364 --> 01:30.536
...then you're continually sensing, planning and acting.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.426
And hopefully, if you've done everything right,...

01:32.509 --> 01:35.034
...it should produce the kind of behavior that you wanna see in a robot.
