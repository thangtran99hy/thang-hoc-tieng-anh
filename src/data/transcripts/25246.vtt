Dear six-year-old, training wheels are for babies.

00:05.611 --> 00:06.927
Just let go already.

00:07.307 --> 00:08.915
Regards, a seven-year-old.

00:09.316 --> 00:14.270
Dear seven-year-old, no matter what anyone says, stay weird.

00:14.718 --> 00:16.038
Signed, an eight-year-old.

00:16.295 --> 00:18.887
Dear twelve-year-old, ask her to dance.

00:19.557 --> 00:20.857
Just trust me on this one.

00:21.404 --> 00:23.065
Signed, a sixteen-year-old.

00:23.543 --> 00:27.347
Dear sixteen-year-old, don't let your mom throw away your legos.

00:27.756 --> 00:29.361
Signed, an eighteen-year-old.

00:29.634 --> 00:32.403
Dear eighteen-year-old, go easy on the makeup.

00:32.627 --> 00:33.978
You are not as ugly as you think.

00:34.502 --> 00:36.175
Love, a nineteen-year-old.

00:36.875 --> 00:39.285
Your parents have better interest rates than your credit card.

00:39.379 --> 00:43.109
If he says he has a weekend home in the suburbs, he's married.

00:43.204 --> 00:45.902
That rust protection undercoating, it's actually a great deal.

00:45.990 --> 00:49.229
Whatever you do, never order the salad from a truck stop.

00:49.313 --> 00:50.740
Back up your hard drive.

00:51.485 --> 00:52.016
Now.

00:52.181 --> 00:53.587
I mean, who even does that?

00:53.709 --> 00:55.865
Getting laid off can be a blessing in disguise.

00:55.945 --> 00:59.748
Being a starving artist only works if you actually make art.

00:59.846 --> 01:01.299
Always be kind to your family.

01:02.161 --> 01:03.905
You'll need each other when things get tough.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.753
Always tell the truth.

01:06.103 --> 01:08.323
Except when it comes to your online dating profile.

01:08.522 --> 01:09.707
Dear fifty-one-year-old,...

01:10.176 --> 01:12.933
...one cat is enough cats.

01:13.619 --> 01:17.606
Dear eighty-eight-year-old, cultivate younger friends.

01:18.509 --> 01:21.242
Otherwise, yours will all die off.

01:23.379 --> 01:25.565
Sincerely, ninety-one years old.
