00:00.751 --> 00:04.165
Here is a bee egg as it hatches into a larva.

00:08.185 --> 00:11.265
Those newly hatched larvae swim around their cells,...

00:11.645 --> 00:15.168
...feeding on a liquid food that nurse bees secrete for them.

00:17.331 --> 00:23.197
Then, their head and their legs start to differentiate as they transform into pupae.

00:25.925 --> 00:28.735
Here's that same pupation process seen from above,...

00:28.956 --> 00:31.424
...with varroa mites running around in the cells.

00:33.903 --> 00:37.143
Next, a tissue reorganizes in their body...

00:37.336 --> 00:39.978
...and the pigment slowly develops in their eyes.

00:47.567 --> 00:51.505
In the last step, their skin shrivels up and they sprout hair.
