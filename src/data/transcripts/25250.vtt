ï»¿I'm really nervous for my date.

00:02.544 --> 00:03.647
Have you ever gone on a first date?

00:04.641 --> 00:04.967
No.

00:05.289 --> 00:06.983
What do you think I should wear?

00:07.201 --> 00:09.299
I think you should not wear something itchy.

00:10.459 --> 00:11.454
What are you gonna make me look like?

00:11.578 --> 00:13.926
You know, like Barbie, you know?

00:15.294 --> 00:16.449
Should I close my eyes for you to do it?

00:17.295 --> 00:18.208
I think so.

00:18.331 --> 00:18.675
Okay.

00:19.011 --> 00:20.081
What should I get to eat?

00:20.252 --> 00:22.535
I think you should get steak and mashed potatoes.

00:23.212 --> 00:26.427
Don't stuff food in your mouth or else it would be messy.

00:26.503 --> 00:27.411
Okay. I won't do that.

00:27.515 --> 00:28.888
Have you ever been on a date before?

00:29.210 --> 00:29.842
With my daddy.

00:29.972 --> 00:31.920
Yeah? Where does he take you?

00:32.399 --> 00:33.365
I have no idea.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.639
What should I do if he doesn't like me?

00:35.877 --> 00:37.988
You know, get used to him...

00:38.140 --> 00:40.036
...like mom gets used to me.

00:41.100 --> 00:42.523
Okay, can I see the mirror?

00:43.113 --> 00:44.938
Wow!
