00:00.515 --> 00:01.601
Get your resume set.

00:01.713 --> 00:02.516
Here is mine!

00:02.873 --> 00:04.947
No, this is 30 pages long.

00:05.093 --> 00:07.293
Make it one page and keep it simple.

00:07.446 --> 00:07.937
Got it!

00:08.663 --> 00:11.483
A good resume has your background info and skills,...

00:11.640 --> 00:12.909
...but don't put in everything.

00:13.068 --> 00:15.008
No one cares if you're a prom king,...

00:15.544 --> 00:17.906
...unless your job interview is for prom kings.

00:18.161 --> 00:18.921
Here is resume!

00:19.638 --> 00:21.807
No, you wrote this in crayon.

00:22.095 --> 00:23.484
But you said keep it simple.

00:23.607 --> 00:26.117
A good resume has to be presentable.

00:26.697 --> 00:27.067
Got it.

00:27.771 --> 00:30.335
That means no typos and easy to read,...

00:30.671 --> 00:32.249
...but not too easy to read.

00:32.547 --> 00:35.285
Don't just write Hodor over and over again,...

00:35.555 --> 00:39.855
...unless you're applying for a job carrying around a little psychic kid with no legs.

00:40.081 --> 00:40.850
Here is resume.

00:41.057 --> 00:43.533
There are no typos, and it is easy to read.

00:45.011 --> 00:46.749
This just says, "My name is Mario."

00:46.870 --> 00:48.997
But I have no background or skills!

00:49.611 --> 00:52.059
Just print out my resume and put your name on it.

00:52.303 --> 00:52.646
Got it!

00:53.501 --> 00:55.527
For the record, you should never do that.

00:55.735 --> 00:57.953
But we'd never get through this video otherwise.
