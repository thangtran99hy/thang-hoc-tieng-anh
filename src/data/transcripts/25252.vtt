One of the first Skypes we ever did was to connect my Tanzanian students...

00:06.061 --> 00:10.491
...with my other passion, which is the Covenant Preparatory School in Hartford, Connecticut.

00:10.804 --> 00:14.297
I thought that these kids and my kids here had so much in common...

00:14.375 --> 00:17.539
...that I wanted them to meet each other, not just through letters.

00:18.110 --> 00:20.507
So, we tried Skype and it worked.

00:25.427 --> 00:28.731
And the first time they saw each other was wonderful because...

00:28.843 --> 00:34.254
...my students here in Tanzania thought that all American students looked like me.

00:34.396 --> 00:36.913
And they were like, "Wow, these kids look like us."

00:37.211 --> 00:38.470
"They talk like us."

00:38.813 --> 00:41.153
"They're not as different as we thought."

00:41.978 --> 00:45.853
They're learning both what's different and much more, what's alike.

00:47.264 --> 00:49.831
When I'm home, my heart's here.

00:51.026 --> 00:54.446
Every minute of the day when I wake up, I can do whatever I have to do...

00:54.705 --> 00:56.633
...because then I know what I'm doing is nothing...

00:56.747 --> 00:58.801
....compared to what they're doing for their education.

00:59.225 --> 01:00.489
They're doing all the hard work.

01:01.284 --> 01:02.713
I'm just supporting them.

01:05.005 --> 01:07.227
We're just blessed with where we're born, it's not...

01:08.362 --> 01:09.631
I didn't choose my parents.

01:10.392 --> 01:12.361
I didn't choose to be born in the United States...

01:12.456 --> 01:15.251
...any more than my students chose to be born where they are.

01:15.745 --> 01:18.482
But they all deserve an education, everybody does.
