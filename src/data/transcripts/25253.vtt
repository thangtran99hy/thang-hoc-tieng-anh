I think it's really important to have some kind of routine...

00:04.262 --> 00:07.219
...that you can count on from the minute you wake up in the morning.

00:07.449 --> 00:09.176
So, that means setting an alarm.

00:09.294 --> 00:11.986
If you don't get up at exactly the same time every day,...

00:12.109 --> 00:15.484
...you wanna make sure it's somewhere around the same time every day.

00:23.519 --> 00:29.101
I know it is so tempting to just sit around in your pajamas all day,...

00:29.263 --> 00:32.127
...not get ready because, I mean, why not?

00:32.239 --> 00:36.056
Doing something as simple as just getting dressed in like a t-shirt and jeans...

00:36.359 --> 00:40.529
...will help you so much because that's almost like, your little work uniform.

00:40.639 --> 00:44.739
This process makes me feel more put together and I'm able to separate...

00:44.863 --> 00:47.015
..."I am working and getting stuff done"...

00:47.237 --> 00:50.681
...from "I'm comfy and cozy in my pajamas watching Netflix."

00:58.567 --> 01:02.835
When you have your designated workspace, it almost becomes like your little office...

01:02.945 --> 01:04.023
... within your home.

01:04.129 --> 01:07.961
So when you walk into that space, you subconsciously know...

01:08.213 --> 01:10.360
...I am turning on for work right now.

01:10.444 --> 01:11.527
This is my work zone.

01:11.755 --> 01:15.973
And when you step out of that space, it's like, "Okay, I'm finished working...

01:16.153 --> 01:18.700
...and now, I am stepping into my life."
