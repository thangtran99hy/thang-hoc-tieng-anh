00:00.030 --> 00:04.126
That morning, we loaded into the vehicle, and I get tapped on the shoulder.

00:04.403 --> 00:07.908
And I got told that I need to bounce up to the next vehicle.

00:08.446 --> 00:10.455
And I said, "Catch you guys on the flip side."

00:11.030 --> 00:14.025
And that was the last thing I ever said to 'em.

00:15.299 --> 00:19.628
Next thing I know, I just hear the loudest explosion.

00:20.159 --> 00:23.743
And I see that's my squad's vehicle that got hit.

00:24.715 --> 00:28.181
The bomb flipped it upside down and ripped it completely in half.

00:28.664 --> 00:31.652
And everything inside of it was just parts.

00:32.487 --> 00:35.323
I am most proud of not blowing my head off by now.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.296
It's just a whole lot easier if you're dead.

00:38.931 --> 00:43.064
But that shouldn't be your tribute to your dead friends.

00:43.941 --> 00:45.305
When they are looking down on you,...

00:45.759 --> 00:48.721
...they don't want you to be living in the moment that killed them.

00:49.648 --> 00:50.106
You made it.

00:50.273 --> 00:51.191
You got home.

00:51.761 --> 00:57.761
You should honor their memory by living the life that they didn't get to live.
