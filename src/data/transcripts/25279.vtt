00:00.032 --> 00:04.337
From 1996 to early 2000, we had one product.

00:04.636 --> 00:08.019
Great entrepreneurs take one product and say, "We're gonna be great for this."

00:08.851 --> 00:12.669
And most importantly, "We're going to be famous for one thing."

00:13.491 --> 00:15.588
And that is like the greatest advice I can give you...

00:15.660 --> 00:19.027
...because so often, you get caught up with trying to "keep up with the Joneses",...

00:19.461 --> 00:21.200
...and going, "But they're doing this and they're doing that."

00:21.280 --> 00:24.637
It's like, they're also like, a 150 times your size.

00:25.128 --> 00:26.541
You're not in the same league.

00:26.875 --> 00:29.840
You need to become great at one thing and that's where Under Armour,...

00:30.327 --> 00:34.958
...when the first five years, today we're on, I think it's over the 60th different iteration...

00:35.213 --> 00:39.641
...of that first short-sleeved, wicking, compression t-shirt that I made.

00:40.088 --> 00:42.759
And so often, you see people going, "You've got to make a long sleeve."

00:42.843 --> 00:43.987
"You've got to make one for women."

00:44.073 --> 00:45.072
"You've got to make one here."

00:45.148 --> 00:48.376
It's like, I have to make this product great.
