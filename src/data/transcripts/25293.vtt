Well, it seems to me that 18s and 19s are more interested in having fun...

00:06.491 --> 00:09.115
...and not thinking about the future.

00:09.853 --> 00:14.297
So, I don't think that they are particularly participating in politics.

00:22.827 --> 00:26.142
It's much more fun to go shopping with friends than going to vote.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.709
I'm interested in politics just like everyone else.

00:31.895 --> 00:34.291
I'm going to go to the election.

00:34.717 --> 00:38.763
It's not enough for the government to change this institution.

00:39.293 --> 00:42.693
The government should also think about the education reform.
