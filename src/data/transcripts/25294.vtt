00:00.050 --> 00:03.164
We gotta get to this next thing because it has been burning up our heat index.

00:03.601 --> 00:05.996
The zesty guy we've been showing you all morning,...

00:06.249 --> 00:07.364
...he's gone viral.

00:07.464 --> 00:08.096
You ask why?

00:08.195 --> 00:09.129
Well, keep watching.

00:09.223 --> 00:13.488
Undressing to sell salad dressing, ABC's Linsey Davis is here with that.

00:13.647 --> 00:14.840
Tough assignment, Linsey.

00:14.936 --> 00:16.681
It is tough stuff. Good morning, Amy.

00:16.803 --> 00:23.111
Kraft, the Midwestern-based company known for being conservative in its advertising is going sexy.

00:23.195 --> 00:27.185
The new ad campaign is the sexiest, or should I say 'zestiest', they've ever gone...

00:27.484 --> 00:30.771
...as they experiment with a new way to sell salad dressing to women.

00:32.755 --> 00:35.791
Ladies, let's make a salad, shall we?

00:38.988 --> 00:41.065
This is the most beautiful pepper I've ever held.

00:44.557 --> 00:46.066
How zesty do you want it?

00:46.371 --> 00:50.773
You've probably never thought of salad dressing as hot, sizzling or spicy.

00:50.931 --> 00:52.992
But Kraft is pouring it on thick.

00:53.115 --> 00:54.231
How about a lot more?

00:56.673 --> 00:59.468
With an ultimately shirtless hunk of a chef.

00:59.605 --> 01:00.224
A little more.

01:01.917 --> 01:05.959
This guy, Anderson Davis, is the one people are talking about.

01:06.108 --> 01:10.733
It's really nice to have people come up and say, "Dude, you're super zesty."

01:11.049 --> 01:12.493
Whatever they're gonna say to you.
