00:03.910 --> 00:06.622
I don't really know much about the political parties...

00:06.778 --> 00:09.516
...or what their policies are so I don't think I'll go to vote.

00:10.023 --> 00:11.068
Not right away anyway.

00:15.165 --> 00:17.144
Yes, I'm very excited.

00:20.436 --> 00:27.389
It's a very important way for me to express my opinion in politics.

00:27.973 --> 00:30.966
Unfortunately, I didn't expect to see any big change...

00:31.089 --> 00:38.670
...because the 18 and 19 years old only covers 2% of the entire list of voters.

00:44.150 --> 00:47.719
I oppose today a lower age of voting system...

00:48.049 --> 00:50.043
...because, as I've told before,...

00:50.141 --> 00:53.433
...18-year-old high school students don't have the education...

00:53.681 --> 00:56.361
...or don't have the information about politics.
