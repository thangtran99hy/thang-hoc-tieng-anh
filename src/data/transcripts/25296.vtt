A new print ad for Kraft salad dressing is drawing quite the controversy,...

00:06.097 --> 00:09.062
...with some saying it's just a little too "zesty."

00:09.315 --> 00:11.365
Kraft released a new series of TV commercials...

00:11.439 --> 00:15.908
...and a print ad that featured this hunky guy cooking food with Zesty salad dressing.

00:16.121 --> 00:18.194
You could say they're suggestive.

00:18.367 --> 00:21.838
Despite its "zesty" approach, the commercials have garnered praise online...

00:21.953 --> 00:25.065
...and attracted more than 1.5 million views on YouTube.

00:25.364 --> 00:28.341
But on May 24, Kraft might have crossed the line...

00:28.473 --> 00:32.149
...when it sent out this tweet of the print ad from the Zesty guy's account.

00:32.269 --> 00:34.832
The Zesty guy is pretty much naked and writes,...

00:34.939 --> 00:38.153
"Me, you and a picnic blanket inside this week's @peoplemag."

00:38.295 --> 00:40.919
"I've been waiting for you. #getzesty"

00:41.214 --> 00:44.633
Just in case you forgot, this is still an ad for salad dressing.

00:44.793 --> 00:48.679
But a Christian advocacy group, One Million Moms, which is often known to speak out,...

00:48.972 --> 00:51.766
...cried foul, saying the ad is way too provocative.

00:52.045 --> 00:53.985
The group calls the print ad "disgusting"...

00:54.072 --> 00:56.810
...and says, "It's easy to see what the ad is really selling."

00:57.014 --> 00:59.667
It's demanding people to take action and contact Kraft,...

00:59.776 --> 01:03.424
...urging the company to discontinue the "Let's Get Zesty" campaign.

01:03.825 --> 01:06.211
No word from Kraft yet on the controversy.

01:06.303 --> 01:08.203
But as the story hit the media circuit,...

01:08.327 --> 01:12.431
...many anchors had their own thoughts on the TV commercial versus the print ad.
