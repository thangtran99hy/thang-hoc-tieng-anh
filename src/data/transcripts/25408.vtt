Kobe Bryant announced in The Players' Tribune, Sunday, that the 2015-16 season...

00:04.699 --> 00:05.973
...will be his very last.

00:06.509 --> 00:12.061
Being the artistic soul that he is, he decided to do so via a poem titled, "Dear Basketball."

00:12.772 --> 00:15.128
"I'm ready to let you go, I want you to know now..."

00:15.283 --> 00:19.090
"...so we both can savor every moment we have left together," Kobe writes.

00:19.541 --> 00:23.446
Last night, the Lakers took on the Indiana Pacers at Staples Center, Los Angeles.

00:23.715 --> 00:27.398
When fans entered the arena, the ushers were handing out Kobe's poem saying...

00:27.540 --> 00:29.077
..."This is from Kobe to you."
