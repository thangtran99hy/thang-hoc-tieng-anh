00:01.705 --> 00:02.330
Captain.

00:03.515 --> 00:06.846
While a great many people see you as a hero,...

00:07.511 --> 00:10.601
...there are some who'd prefer the word vigilante.

00:11.761 --> 00:15.088
You've operated with unlimited power and no supervision.

00:16.533 --> 00:18.953
That's something the world can no longer tolerate.

00:20.567 --> 00:22.412
I know how much Bucky means to you.

00:24.675 --> 00:25.715
Stay out of this one.

00:26.113 --> 00:26.563
Please.

00:27.753 --> 00:29.152
You'll only make this worse.

00:29.909 --> 00:30.982
You're saying you'll arrest me?

00:32.065 --> 00:34.787
There will be consequences.

00:37.546 --> 00:39.631
Captain, you seem a little defensive.

00:40.007 --> 00:40.971
Well, it's been a long day.

00:41.787 --> 00:44.686
If we can't accept limitations, we're no better than the bad guys.

00:45.545 --> 00:46.677
That's not the way I see it.

00:48.275 --> 00:50.465
Sometimes I want to punch you in your perfect teeth.

00:52.981 --> 00:53.701
I'm sorry, Tony.

00:55.060 --> 00:56.932
You know I wouldn't do this if I had any other choice.

00:58.417 --> 00:59.597
But he's my friend.

01:00.721 --> 01:01.371
So was I.
