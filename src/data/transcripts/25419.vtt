If you lined up all the blood vessels in your body,...

00:11.041 --> 00:14.570
...they'd be 95,000 kilometers long...

00:15.048 --> 00:21.435
...and every day, they carry the equivalent of over 7,500 liters of blood,...

00:21.705 --> 00:26.809
...though that's actually the same four or five liters recycled over and over,...

00:27.009 --> 00:32.135
...delivering oxygen and precious nutrients like glucose and amino acids...

00:32.419 --> 00:33.632
...to the body's tissues.

00:34.223 --> 00:39.653
All that blood exerts a force on the muscular walls of the blood vessels.

00:40.184 --> 00:42.436
That force is called blood pressure...

00:42.722 --> 00:46.373
...and it rises and falls with the phases of the heartbeat.
