A, C, E, D, B, K.

00:10.833 --> 00:13.997
No, this isn't some random, out-of-order alphabet.

00:14.161 --> 00:15.629
These are vitamins,...

00:15.830 --> 00:17.771
...and just like letters build words,...

00:17.985 --> 00:20.901
...they're the building blocks that keep the body running.

00:21.545 --> 00:26.589
Vitamins are organic compounds we need to ingest in small amounts to keep functioning.

00:27.176 --> 00:30.483
They're the body's builders, defenders and maintenance workers,...

00:30.652 --> 00:33.845
...helping it to build muscle and bone, make use of nutrients,...

00:34.047 --> 00:36.841
...capture and use energy and heal wounds.

00:37.429 --> 00:39.712
If you need convincing about vitamin value,...

00:39.937 --> 00:42.789
...just consider the plight of olden-day sailors,...

00:42.968 --> 00:46.021
...who had no access to vitamin-rich fresh produce.

00:46.215 --> 00:47.416
They got scurvy.

00:47.606 --> 00:50.425
But vitamin C, abundant in fruits and vegetables,...

00:50.570 --> 00:52.682
...was the simple antidote to this disease.

00:53.268 --> 00:56.631
While bacteria, fungi and plants produce their own vitamins,...

00:56.785 --> 01:00.375
...our bodies can't, so we have to get them from other sources.
