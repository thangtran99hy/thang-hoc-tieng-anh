Has anyone ever told you, "Stand up straight!"

00:10.966 --> 00:13.647
Or scolded you for slouching at a family dinner?

00:14.435 --> 00:17.827
Comments like that might be annoying, but they're not wrong.

00:18.263 --> 00:22.309
Your posture, the way you hold your body when you're sitting or standing,...

00:22.533 --> 00:25.555
...is the foundation for every movement your body makes,...

00:25.849 --> 00:29.895
...and can determine how well your body adapts to the stresses on it.

00:30.213 --> 00:35.227
These stresses can be things like carrying weight, or sitting in an awkward position.

00:35.415 --> 00:40.258
And the big one we all experience all day every day: gravity.

00:40.938 --> 00:42.600
If your posture isn't optimal,...

00:42.781 --> 00:46.485
...your muscles have to work harder to keep you upright and balanced.

00:46.677 --> 00:49.112
Some muscles will become tight and inflexible

00:49.382 --> 00:50.869
Others will be inhibited.

00:51.302 --> 00:54.432
Over time, these dysfunctional adaptations...

00:54.581 --> 00:57.974
...impair your body's ability to deal with the forces on it.

00:58.431 --> 01:02.364
Poor posture inflicts extra wear and tear on your joints and ligaments,...

01:02.593 --> 01:04.761
...increases the likelihood of accidents,...

01:05.163 --> 01:08.499
...and makes some organs, like your lungs, less efficient.

01:09.167 --> 01:14.521
Researchers have linked poor posture to scoliosis, tension headaches, and back pain,...

01:14.755 --> 01:17.539
...though it isn't the exclusive cause of any of them.

01:18.190 --> 01:22.975
Posture can even influence your emotional state and your sensitivity to pain.

01:23.689 --> 01:26.716
So, there are a lot of reasons to aim for good posture.
