00:07.380 --> 00:14.949
It's 4 a.m. and the big test is in eight hours followed by a piano recital.

00:15.637 --> 00:18.305
You've been studying and playing for days,...

00:18.506 --> 00:21.159
...but you still don't feel ready for either.

00:21.731 --> 00:22.819
So, what can you do?

00:23.195 --> 00:25.125
Well, you can drink another cup of coffee...

00:25.216 --> 00:27.727
...and spend the next few hours cramming and practicing.

00:27.893 --> 00:31.939
But believe it or not, you might be better off closing the books,...

00:32.165 --> 00:35.016
...putting away the music, and going to sleep.

00:35.543 --> 00:38.109
Sleep occupies nearly a third of our lives,...

00:38.381 --> 00:42.199
...but many of us give surprisingly little attention and care to it.

00:42.866 --> 00:46.287
This neglect is often the result of a major misunderstanding.

00:46.683 --> 00:51.697
Sleep isn't lost time or just a way to rest when all our important work is done.

00:52.294 --> 00:54.264
Instead, it's a critical function,...

00:54.529 --> 00:58.325
...during which your body balances and regulates its vital systems,...

00:58.773 --> 01:01.357
...affecting respiration and regulating everything...

01:01.430 --> 01:04.721
...from circulation to growth and immune response.

01:05.743 --> 01:09.958
That's great, but you can worry about all those things after this test, right?

01:10.474 --> 01:11.929
Well, not so fast.

01:12.119 --> 01:15.339
It turns out that sleep is also crucial for your brain,...

01:15.628 --> 01:20.222
...with a fifth of your body's circulatory blood being channeled to it as you drift off.

01:20.759 --> 01:23.039
And what goes on in your brain while you sleep...

01:23.292 --> 01:28.447
...is an intensely active period of restructuring that's crucial for how our memory works.
