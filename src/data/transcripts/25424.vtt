Vitamins come in two types: lipid-soluble and water-soluble.

00:04.545 --> 00:08.819
And the difference between them determines how the body transports and stores vitamins,...

00:09.081 --> 00:10.567
...and gets rid of the excess.

00:10.978 --> 00:15.261
The water solubles are vitamin C and B complex vitamins...

00:15.452 --> 00:18.702
...that are made up of eight different types that each do something unique.

00:19.085 --> 00:23.244
These are dissolved in the watery parts of fruits, vegetables and grains,...

00:23.457 --> 00:26.707
...meaning their passage through the body is relatively straightforward.

00:27.091 --> 00:29.411
Once inside the system, these foods are digested...

00:29.564 --> 00:32.889
...and the vitamins within them are taken up directly by the bloodstream.

00:33.309 --> 00:35.349
Because blood plasma is water-based,...

00:35.570 --> 00:39.639
...water-soluble vitamins C and B have their transport cut out for them...

00:39.837 --> 00:42.091
...and can move around freely within the body.

00:42.557 --> 00:48.367
For lipid-soluble vitamins, dissolved in fat and found in foods like dairy, butter and oils,...

00:48.609 --> 00:51.461
...this trip into the blood is a little more adventurous.

00:51.809 --> 00:54.604
These vitamins make it through the stomach and the intestine,...

00:54.898 --> 00:57.920
...where an acidic substance called bile flows in from the liver,...

00:58.141 --> 01:02.244
...breaking up the fat and preparing it for absorption through the intestinal wall.

01:02.725 --> 01:06.543
Because fat-soluble vitamins can't make use of the blood's watery nature,...

01:06.798 --> 01:08.910
...they need something else to move them around,...

01:09.260 --> 01:11.898
...and that comes from proteins that attach to the vitamins...

01:11.974 --> 01:17.157
...and act like couriers, transporting fat solubles into the blood and around the body.

01:18.044 --> 01:23.541
So, this difference between water or fat-soluble vitamins determines how they get into the blood.
