Well, I appreciate your interest in wanting to be a Fort Worth police officer.

00:07.762 --> 00:09.100
What makes you think you're qualified?

00:09.886 --> 00:16.605
If you could see on my resume, I have ruled over the Imperial Force for sometime.

00:17.387 --> 00:20.753
It had great success in ruling the galaxies.

00:21.370 --> 00:25.995
What is this about a Death Star blowing up under your command?

00:26.911 --> 00:28.420
I was cleared of that.

00:28.870 --> 00:30.044
Not my fault.

00:31.184 --> 00:36.544
You can see per my resume, I'm quite proficient at using the Force.

00:37.827 --> 00:40.506
Well, we refer to it as use of force...

00:40.781 --> 00:43.814
...and I don't think that's quite the same thing you think it is.

00:54.495 --> 00:58.265
Also, we require our recruits to pass a physical assessment test...

00:58.377 --> 01:02.209
...and quite honestly, you sound like you have a deep breathing issue.

01:02.507 --> 01:03.877
Do you think that's gonna be a problem?

01:15.049 --> 01:21.149
You don't have to worry about my breathing because I can disarm a suspect...

01:21.608 --> 01:23.246
...without having to chase him.

01:23.972 --> 01:24.985
How can you do that?

01:30.235 --> 01:31.195
Give me that.

01:38.650 --> 01:40.078
Okay, I think we're done here.

01:41.347 --> 01:43.014
You want to hire me.

01:44.152 --> 01:44.681
What?

01:45.501 --> 01:48.477
I am the recruit you are looking for.

01:49.161 --> 01:49.881
Okay.

01:50.321 --> 01:52.082
Thanks for your time, we'll let you know.

02:01.441 --> 02:03.592
Do you, by chance, validate?

02:04.834 --> 02:05.512
Please leave.
