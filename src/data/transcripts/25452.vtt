Tens of millions of young Americans are drowning in student loan debt.

00:05.591 --> 00:08.450
But one person is trying to reinvent higher ed...

00:08.525 --> 00:11.841
...and the outrageous cost associated with getting a degree.

00:12.103 --> 00:14.235
And he's an MIT dropout.

00:16.271 --> 00:20.180
Our mission is to provide the most accessible, highest quality CS education...

00:20.487 --> 00:23.441
...that is really out there in higher ed.

00:23.765 --> 00:26.275
And a big part of that is not taking tuition from students up front,...

00:26.387 --> 00:28.026
...and instead taking a percentage of their salaries.

00:28.182 --> 00:31.964
'Cause there should not be a way for a school to succeed...

00:32.084 --> 00:34.232
...other than producing successful students.

00:34.601 --> 00:37.917
What really differentiates Make School from the traditional college?

00:38.555 --> 00:39.418
Several factors.

00:39.508 --> 00:40.061
There's no grades.

00:40.131 --> 00:40.656
There's no tests.

00:40.723 --> 00:43.857
There's no traditional problem-based homework.

00:44.155 --> 00:48.545
It's all about building things as you would in the real world.

00:48.987 --> 00:55.005
Do you think that students are taking too big of a risk to give up formal education?

00:55.233 --> 00:57.551
I think culturally we've mixed up the cause and effect...

00:57.896 --> 01:01.180
...between getting your degree and having a good life afterwards.

01:01.684 --> 01:05.970
It's not the degree that got it for you.

01:06.060 --> 01:09.019
It's what you will learn in the name of the school and the connections it brought you.
