There has been a lot of buzz about Apple poaching engineers from Tesla...

00:04.181 --> 00:06.999
...to work on a project rumored to be an automobile.

00:07.113 --> 00:09.361
But Musk apparently doesn't care.

00:09.621 --> 00:12.957
He told the paper that Apple is the "Tesla graveyard."

00:13.249 --> 00:15.097
They have hired people we've fired.

00:15.197 --> 00:17.763
If you don't make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple.

00:17.909 --> 00:18.812
I'm not kidding.

00:19.046 --> 00:22.758
Musk was pretty dismissive about Apple's rumored car plans overall,...

00:22.882 --> 00:26.329
...saying, "Designing a car isn't like designing smartphones."

00:26.550 --> 00:29.769
Despite what Musk says, he does seem a little agitated...

00:29.841 --> 00:33.318
...about all the attention the company is getting from the electric car rumors.

00:33.459 --> 00:38.326
Musk could be worried about a company with that much clout entering into the competition.

00:38.449 --> 00:42.918
In the interview, Musk also touched on Tesla's profits or lack of profits.

00:43.281 --> 00:47.012
He says he hopes the company will be profitable sometime in 2016,...

00:47.317 --> 00:50.885
...but he won't adjust plans for growth just to turn a profit.

00:51.467 --> 00:53.036
For Newsy, I'm Mikah Sargent.
