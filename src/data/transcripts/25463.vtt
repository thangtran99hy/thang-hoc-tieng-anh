Everybody loves apples.

00:05.664 --> 00:11.274
An apple is a smooth, shiny, round fruit with the top and bottom pushed in.

00:13.067 --> 00:16.658
It is green when it's raw but a deep red when it's ripe.

00:19.487 --> 00:21.712
It tastes tangy and sweet normally.

00:24.583 --> 00:27.518
It has a few seeds in the middle which are thrown away.

00:30.475 --> 00:34.976
If you haven't eaten an apple so far, folks, you have missed something in life.
