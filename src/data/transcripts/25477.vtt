I can imagine that seeing someone smile could be,...

00:03.576 --> 00:05.283
...is probably a really pretty thing to see.

00:05.502 --> 00:10.099
When I could see, I loved, I loved having eye contact with people.

00:10.520 --> 00:13.625
And I loved it when people smiled you could see the smile in their face...

00:13.700 --> 00:14.984
...and the smile in their eyes.

00:26.795 --> 00:29.042
Oh my god, it just vibrated!

00:29.465 --> 00:32.811
Oh, that's really cool!

00:33.202 --> 00:34.448
It's vibrating!

00:35.339 --> 00:37.463
When I first got it, I just thought it's gonna be a bit of fun.

00:37.737 --> 00:39.437
But actually it's like, it's really special.

00:40.219 --> 00:41.615
It's something that people just take for granted,...

00:41.703 --> 00:42.881
...knowing that they're being smiled at.

00:43.279 --> 00:46.089
But when you don't know that, you're kind of missing that interaction.

00:46.483 --> 00:48.629
So, when you know, through this, that you're being smiled at,...

00:48.729 --> 00:51.504
...it kind of makes you feel that, "Oh that's nice, someone's smiling at me."
