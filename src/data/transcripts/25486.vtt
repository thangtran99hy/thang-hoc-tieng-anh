Koreatown in Los Angeles is the biggest one in the States.

00:06.812 --> 00:10.501
It's literally a piece of Korea just kind of planted in the middle of LA.

00:11.356 --> 00:15.177
But it's not just Koreans living in Koreatown.

00:15.359 --> 00:17.383
There's a huge Latino population.

00:17.478 --> 00:20.078
There's a huge young professional population...

00:20.191 --> 00:22.890
...that chooses to live here because of its central location.

00:23.344 --> 00:26.707
So, it's really cool to see that interaction between cultures.

00:27.163 --> 00:28.979
If you are a big food person,...

00:29.099 --> 00:32.576
...Koreatown is totally a destination spot you have to come and try.

00:33.431 --> 00:36.492
When the sun goes down, it's a very exciting place.

00:36.805 --> 00:38.881
A lot of people come here to have fun.

00:39.074 --> 00:41.674
Bars are open, karaokes are open.

00:43.529 --> 00:46.023
I love that Koreatown is 24 hours.

00:46.273 --> 00:49.266
You can go and have a mud bath literally at 5:00 AM.
