00:00.580 --> 00:02.627
Ever since the world found out about mutants,...

00:02.818 --> 00:04.645
...there have been secret societies...

00:04.765 --> 00:08.391
...who see them as some kind of second coming or sign of God.

00:08.895 --> 00:12.979
They believe that tens of thousands of years ago, an ancient being was born.

00:13.316 --> 00:14.338
The world's first...

00:14.824 --> 00:15.419
...mutant.

00:16.661 --> 00:17.783
The world needs the X-Men.

00:18.079 --> 00:18.917
That's why I'm here,...

00:19.229 --> 00:19.823
...to fight.

00:21.078 --> 00:22.905
Not all of us can control our powers.

00:23.061 --> 00:23.659
Then don't.

00:24.339 --> 00:25.221
This is war.

00:28.024 --> 00:33.091
Everything they've built will fall!

00:34.001 --> 00:39.763
And from the ashes of their world, we'll build a better one.

00:47.872 --> 00:50.529
I've never felt power like this before.
