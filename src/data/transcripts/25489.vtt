"Follow that cat!"

00:28.633 --> 00:33.231
As the neighbors gathered, the fireman told everyone how Mog had saved the day.

00:33.369 --> 00:34.825
"She deserves a medal."

00:35.088 --> 00:36.840
"I think she'd rather have an egg."

00:38.071 --> 00:40.104
But there was no egg for Mog.

00:41.981 --> 00:43.626
There was no Christmas at all.

00:51.735 --> 00:53.490
At least that's what they thought.

00:56.633 --> 01:00.714
But everyone else thought that if the Thomases and Mog can't have a Christmas,...

01:01.402 --> 01:03.263
...they can share ours.

01:11.447 --> 01:14.801
So that's exactly what they all did.

01:18.397 --> 01:19.663
"There you go Mog."
