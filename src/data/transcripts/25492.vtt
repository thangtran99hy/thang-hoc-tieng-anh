00:00.157 --> 00:01.928
Now, take the typical comedy,...

00:02.539 --> 00:05.584
...there will probably be some type of misunderstanding.

00:05.998 --> 00:08.954
Again, we know more of what is going on than the characters do.

00:09.360 --> 00:12.975
Picture two characters making a plan for a birthday surprise for their roommate...

00:13.369 --> 00:17.027
...while that roommate overhears the entire conversation from the hallway.

00:17.356 --> 00:21.815
From there, confusion and misunderstanding occur and the tension builds.

00:22.179 --> 00:26.177
But this isn't the same tension as the horror film since it is probably pretty funny...

00:26.524 --> 00:29.027
...as the character try to figure out the who's and the what's.

00:29.674 --> 00:34.243
But it serves as a great example of the tension and suspense of dramatic irony.

00:34.786 --> 00:37.289
This tension or suspense in both genres...

00:37.369 --> 00:40.622
...drives the story and keeps the plot progressing the audience wants.

00:41.010 --> 00:45.037
No, needs to see the tension of the dramatic irony broken...

00:45.321 --> 00:48.034
...either by the scary person jumping out of the shadows...

00:48.363 --> 00:51.622
...or by someone finally revealing someone's true identity...

00:51.927 --> 00:53.399
...and clearing up the confusion.

00:53.806 --> 00:58.118
So when you feel like you are in on a secret that is dramatic irony.

00:58.626 --> 01:03.005
A hallmark of all the great writers from Shakespeare to Hitchcock.
