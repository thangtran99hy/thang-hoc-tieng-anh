Sir, I must advise against this.

00:09.386 --> 00:11.635
The odds of survival are 608:1.

00:11.732 --> 00:12.832
No choice, 3PO.

00:12.935 --> 00:13.795
My sister's in trouble.

00:14.921 --> 00:15.601
R2 gets it.

00:26.487 --> 00:27.660
Everything okay, bud?

00:27.857 --> 00:28.680
I'm not sure yet.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.998
Hurry, you're our only hope.

00:33.398 --> 00:34.145
Lisa!

00:34.697 --> 00:35.815
What took you so long?

00:39.789 --> 00:41.355
Well this just got interesting.

00:41.709 --> 00:42.506
Follow my lead.

00:53.125 --> 00:56.205
Never underestimate the power of imagination.
