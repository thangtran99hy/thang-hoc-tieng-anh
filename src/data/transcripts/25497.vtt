00:02.264 --> 00:07.771
But there's one thing that just about every dog does: bark.

00:11.842 --> 00:13.185
So why do they bark?

00:14.330 --> 00:15.645
Where does it come from?

00:17.443 --> 00:18.815
Wolves don't bark.

00:19.419 --> 00:20.453
They howl.

00:22.630 --> 00:26.563
Some scientists think that barking has evolved just for our benefit.

00:27.811 --> 00:30.589
So does this mean that they're talking to us?

00:30.891 --> 00:33.201
And if so, what are they saying?

00:34.309 --> 00:36.421
They seem to understand our words.

00:37.038 --> 00:37.609
Dig, dig.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.146
Come on, speak.

00:42.613 --> 00:43.438
Good boy.

00:43.701 --> 00:46.496
But can dogs really talk to us by barking?

00:46.625 --> 00:48.670
I don't think anybody ever understands dogs.

00:49.034 --> 00:49.913
They understand you.

00:49.995 --> 00:51.848
I don't think you'll ever understand a dog.

00:52.888 --> 00:55.339
It's been identified that dogs can communicate...

00:55.401 --> 00:58.765
...at least six different emotions to us through their barks.

01:00.697 --> 01:01.815
That's why I know what you're thinking.

01:03.095 --> 01:08.733
That just proves, doesn't it, that dogs can talk by barking.
