You might wonder if your dog could qualify to be a guide dog.

00:05.696 --> 00:07.807
You can get an idea by observing them.

00:08.981 --> 00:12.515
Research has shown that dogs are left or right-pawed.

00:13.066 --> 00:14.535
Are you a left-footer, Max?

00:15.065 --> 00:16.438
Hey, are you a left-footer?

00:16.571 --> 00:16.944
No?

00:17.337 --> 00:21.212
You can test this by watching closely to see which paw they step off with.

00:21.427 --> 00:23.017
I think that was a right foot starter.

00:23.333 --> 00:23.667
Yeah.

00:24.495 --> 00:26.068
Yeah, she's left-footed, isn't she?

00:26.634 --> 00:27.801
You're left-handed.

00:27.969 --> 00:28.773
Okay, let's go.

00:31.263 --> 00:36.265
I think we've proven there in that unbiased test that it was his right foot that came forward.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.621
Preliminary research has shown that right-pawed dogs...

00:40.704 --> 00:43.755
...are statistically more likely to pass the guide dog test.

00:44.177 --> 00:46.418
You'd get run over by the bus, you would, wouldn't you?

00:49.308 --> 00:51.733
There's another clue to the chances of them passing:...

00:51.986 --> 00:54.098
...in the swirls of hair on your dog.

00:54.865 --> 00:57.080
And it all depends which way they turn.

00:57.806 --> 00:58.609
Clockwise.

01:00.663 --> 01:01.645
Anticlockwise.

01:02.640 --> 01:06.359
If your dog is right-pawed and the swirl goes anticlockwise,...

01:06.538 --> 01:10.129
...then your dog is more likely to be calm, confident and self-assured.

01:11.385 --> 01:14.072
Exactly the traits that a guide dog needs.
