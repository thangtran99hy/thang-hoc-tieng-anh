ï»¿I'm gonna lose 10 pounds and then gain 20.

00:09.183 --> 00:12.821
I'm gonna start flossing more two days before my dentist appointment.

00:12.905 --> 00:15.304
I'm gonna cut down on beer except for happy hour.

00:16.049 --> 00:16.582
I love beer.

00:16.666 --> 00:18.683
I'm going to start being more eco-friendly...

00:19.284 --> 00:22.570
...unless I can't figure out if something's recyclable like this.

00:23.203 --> 00:24.170
This is going in the trash.

00:24.277 --> 00:27.886
I'm gonna keep my house cleaner but probably only when I'm having people over.

00:27.987 --> 00:31.359
I'm gonna pick up piano unless it's really hard then I'm over it.

00:31.435 --> 00:33.136
I'm gonna start reading more literature.

00:34.260 --> 00:38.156
Well, probably only if it's going to be made into a movie like 50 Shades.

00:38.224 --> 00:42.253
You know, I'm going to be a vegetarian probably until I smell bacon.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.578
I'm gonna stop checking Facebook.

00:46.611 --> 00:48.283
Oh, Mary got engaged.

00:49.252 --> 00:49.840
Congrats.
