Hi!

00:01.033 --> 00:01.478
Hello!

00:01.627 --> 00:02.421
Hey, how are you doing?

00:02.497 --> 00:03.054
Good, how are you?

00:03.437 --> 00:04.221
Go ahead and have a seat.

00:04.422 --> 00:05.421
Thanks for coming today.

00:05.522 --> 00:06.446
Thanks for having us.

00:06.825 --> 00:10.034
We are a marketing research company, so I need to collect your phones...

00:10.098 --> 00:12.921
...so you can't take pictures, can't instagram, can't tweet about things.

00:13.195 --> 00:13.791
Thank you.

00:13.963 --> 00:16.470
Go ahead and put your safety goggles on at this time.

00:45.692 --> 00:46.633
Okay.

00:58.895 --> 01:00.189
That's my phone.

01:01.431 --> 01:02.081
Yeah.

01:04.144 --> 01:06.541
What was your reaction when I threw your phone on the wood chipper?

01:06.777 --> 01:07.663
A little bit lost.

01:07.805 --> 01:08.412
It's scary.

01:08.557 --> 01:11.107
It's kind of terrifying how many things are connected to my phone...

01:11.205 --> 01:12.436
...and I wanna punch you in the face.

01:14.863 --> 01:16.331
How does it feel to not be connected?

01:17.847 --> 01:18.847
My chest hurts.

01:18.993 --> 01:19.491
Broke.

01:19.708 --> 01:21.525
I feel like I'm in the pioneer days or something.

01:22.819 --> 01:23.802
Why do you think that is?

01:24.562 --> 01:25.971
'Cause you're so connected with it.

01:26.102 --> 01:28.441
Like, I have to have it on me at all times.

01:28.735 --> 01:32.172
Well, let me ease your mind when I give you your phones back.

01:36.785 --> 01:37.828
Everyone can breathe now.

01:40.988 --> 01:41.879
So, how does that feel?

01:42.114 --> 01:44.965
Yeah, much better, much better.

01:45.044 --> 01:45.712
A sigh of relief.

01:45.903 --> 01:48.573
What's more important, the phone or having the connection?

01:48.677 --> 01:49.645
The connection.

01:49.849 --> 01:50.889
I don't wanna disconnect.

01:51.033 --> 01:54.127
I live in this modern age and I'm very happy with it.

01:54.306 --> 01:55.907
Now, you wanna see a better way to keep connected?

01:56.463 --> 01:57.267
Alright.

01:58.461 --> 02:00.191
This is the 2016 Chevy Cruze.

02:00.529 --> 02:00.982
Wow!

02:01.996 --> 02:04.239
Cruze offers built-in 4G LTE Wi-Fi...

02:04.343 --> 02:07.027
...with a reliable connection more powerful than your smartphone.

02:07.189 --> 02:08.049
Nice!

02:08.195 --> 02:10.055
So, this thing puts out its own signal?

02:10.149 --> 02:10.493
Yes.

02:10.620 --> 02:11.430
What?

02:11.523 --> 02:13.473
It does connect up to seven devices.

02:13.539 --> 02:13.935
Seven?

02:14.607 --> 02:16.603
This is awesome, I love this.

02:16.696 --> 02:18.751
This is like, next level Chevy.

02:18.937 --> 02:19.957
Thank you guys for coming today.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.526
Thanks for not really killing our phones.
