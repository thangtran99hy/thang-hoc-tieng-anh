WEBVTT

00:09.096 --> 00:12.857
We are an endangered species, you and I.

00:13.244 --> 00:15.375
We lovers of speed.

00:15.589 --> 00:19.806
We devotees of power, performance and noise.

00:21.036 --> 00:22.409
"Go away," we are told,...

00:22.725 --> 00:26.863
..."and take your carbon fiber and your fire-spitting V12s with you."

00:28.070 --> 00:30.413
There's hardly a place for us out here anymore.

00:31.147 --> 00:34.451
Not amongst all the commuters and congestion.

00:38.746 --> 00:42.451
Not in this growing age of safety and restraint,...

00:46.839 --> 00:49.350
...where practicality trumps adrenaline.

00:50.563 --> 00:56.031
Where the ratio of miles to the gallon is championed over horsepower to the weight.

00:59.107 --> 01:00.917
The evidence is everywhere.

01:01.208 --> 01:08.041
You and I are being squeezed out, pushed aside and hunted down at every hairpin turn.

01:11.707 --> 01:13.591
And yet there is hope.

01:13.979 --> 01:15.806
There is a safe haven,...

01:15.992 --> 01:20.513
...a place where we are free to challenge conventions, push the laws of physics...

01:20.595 --> 01:25.153
...and drive our powerful, our beautiful machines hard.

01:29.259 --> 01:32.699
It's not a racetrack in Germany or even a highway in Montana.

01:34.508 --> 01:36.535
It's not even a real place, actually.

01:37.820 --> 01:39.193
It's more than that.

01:41.451 --> 01:48.171
It's a communal celebration of horsepower, torque, grip, leather, technology, beauty.

01:49.073 --> 01:54.200
It is the last bastion of automotive lust.

01:57.682 --> 02:00.704
And it's right there, in your living room.
