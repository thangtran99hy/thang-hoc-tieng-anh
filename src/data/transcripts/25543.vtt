For many Canadians like eight-year-old Maya Ray, it's kind of a ritual:...

00:04.494 --> 00:07.374
...winding down and curling up with a good book.

00:07.722 --> 00:12.167
Reading is great, but Maya's mom has one little problem with this.

00:12.412 --> 00:13.514
I get upset at her.

00:13.581 --> 00:16.153
I'm like, "Maya! Stop reading in the dark!"

00:16.473 --> 00:19.745
So, does reading in low light really damage your eyes?

00:20.009 --> 00:22.177
We asked optometrist Nayeem Abdullah.

00:22.423 --> 00:23.147
I hear it all the time.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.691
His answer may surprise you.

00:24.861 --> 00:27.055
It's best to get the lights to be bright.

00:27.304 --> 00:29.189
It just makes reading easier,...

00:29.343 --> 00:32.350
...but it doesn't harm the eye in the long run, as far as we can tell for now.

00:32.477 --> 00:37.031
Reading goes well beyond books these days, from laptops and tablets to cell phones.

00:37.399 --> 00:40.141
Screens are getting smaller and so is the type.

00:40.379 --> 00:42.545
For some, it's a pain in the eye.

00:42.775 --> 00:45.057
So, we tell people to do the 20-20-20 rule.

00:45.797 --> 00:49.241
Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and look 20 feet.

00:49.327 --> 00:55.763
So, that forces your eyes to go from that converged, a status like this, to further out.

00:56.073 --> 00:57.181
It just relaxes the eyes.

00:57.307 --> 00:58.907
So then, you can go back to doing your job.

00:59.391 --> 01:01.518
You can also help your eyes from the inside.

01:01.621 --> 01:05.281
A diet high in antioxidants, berries and beans work well.

01:05.648 --> 01:11.714
And Omega-3s, things like fish, nuts and green leafy vegetables, are great for your eyes.

01:12.344 --> 01:15.567
And while reading in dim light isn't necessarily harmful,...

01:15.694 --> 01:20.953
...I would tell moms to get a good light in their kid's rooms for sure.

01:21.273 --> 01:22.121
It doesn't hurt.
