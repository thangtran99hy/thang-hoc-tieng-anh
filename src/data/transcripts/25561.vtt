The Tree of 40 Fruit is a single fruit tree...

00:06.606 --> 00:09.361
...that grows over 40 different types of stone fruit,...

00:09.655 --> 00:13.781
...including peaches, plums, apricots, nectarines, cherries and almonds.

00:15.107 --> 00:18.943
The idea came from just sort of a fascination with the process of grafting.

00:22.881 --> 00:27.225
When I'd seen it done as a child, it was Dr. Seuss and Frankenstein...

00:27.301 --> 00:28.953
...and just about everything fantastic.

00:33.636 --> 00:36.619
I started traveling around Central New York and New York State...

00:37.119 --> 00:39.791
...to look for different varieties of stone fruit.

00:40.839 --> 00:45.662
Eventually, I was able to find these different heirloom and antique varieties,...

00:45.871 --> 00:49.533
...but they are very rare so I would bring 'em back here to my nursery,...

00:49.639 --> 00:53.468
...graft them onto a tree so that I could continue to use them.

00:54.509 --> 00:57.870
Now I have a huge collection of plums and apricots.

01:00.526 --> 01:03.822
Unlike any other artworks that I've made,...

01:04.083 --> 01:05.883
...these things continuously evolve.

01:07.510 --> 01:11.247
I think one of the reasons why I've been able to keep it going for so long...

01:11.845 --> 01:15.589
...is that every year, it's something new.

01:18.795 --> 01:21.368
And when you come out here and the trees are all in blossom,...

01:22.069 --> 01:24.452
...it's really kind of an amazing experience.
