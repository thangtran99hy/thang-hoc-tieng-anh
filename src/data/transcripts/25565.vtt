Hey guys, Dean here, and this week we will be heading over to Boryeong, South Korea...

00:06.491 --> 00:08.199
...where we meet a handful of humans...

00:08.491 --> 00:11.889
...who are seeking an especially slimy kind of fun this summer.

00:12.299 --> 00:16.184
Visitors in their millions flock to the city's annual mud festival,...

00:16.386 --> 00:20.894
...where the aim is to arrive clean and then get as muddy as humanly possible.

00:21.249 --> 00:25.182
As you can see, it looks both mental and quite liberating,...

00:25.548 --> 00:30.249
...although I'm not sure if these are screams of laughter or absolute terror.

00:30.942 --> 00:34.981
Perfect for either a romantic date or just a day out with the boys,...

00:35.295 --> 00:38.439
...the Mud Festival offers an array of muddy memories.

00:38.819 --> 00:41.313
These include being pushed down a slide...

00:41.405 --> 00:43.475
...and then have mud thrown in your face at the bottom,...

00:43.866 --> 00:48.164
...being trapped in a weird, sadistic, prisoner of war, muddy torture chamber,...

00:48.499 --> 00:54.529
...sliding away through tiny, muddy plastic holes and even a sort of muddy rave.
