00:00.922 --> 00:02.499
I judge people all the time.

00:02.829 --> 00:04.201
I judge working moms.

00:04.297 --> 00:06.713
Why do you have to leave every night by this certain time?

00:06.859 --> 00:08.261
Why aren't you married?

00:08.349 --> 00:10.829
Now that you have a baby, are you going to get married?

00:10.995 --> 00:12.371
I will never let my kid do that.

00:12.457 --> 00:15.960
My kid will never misbehave in a restaurant.

00:16.074 --> 00:17.507
I think I'm desensitized almost...

00:17.620 --> 00:20.900
...because people talk about whether or not I breastfeed or bottle feed so much.

00:21.019 --> 00:25.023
A lot of the choices that I make for my baby I have to fight for it...

00:25.154 --> 00:29.077
...so when I see someone doing the opposite I definitely find myself judging them.

00:29.180 --> 00:31.475
It's very easy to be judgmental of others...

00:31.551 --> 00:35.370
...and I think that's why people are judgmental because it really is easy.
