Ciao from Roma.

00:07.748 --> 00:12.098
I'm at the foot of St. Peter's Basilica, about to get on the hop on, hop off bus.

00:12.379 --> 00:15.303
I'm Trish from Trip Styler and Expedia Viewfinder.

00:15.589 --> 00:16.760
Welcome to Rome.

00:22.649 --> 00:26.263
I'm in front of St. Peter's Basilica, the largest Christian Church in the world...

00:26.537 --> 00:30.538
...where I just skipped the line and found out that it took 109 years to build...

00:30.817 --> 00:32.587
...and 63 years to decorate.

00:34.759 --> 00:37.407
There's a gelateria every ten steps in Rome,...

00:37.613 --> 00:40.970
...so make sure you get a gelato to cool down between every activity.

00:43.325 --> 00:48.959
Now, I'm at the Colosseum with Walks of Italy for the VIP Ceasar's Forum and Colosseum tour.

00:49.261 --> 00:51.897
This is one of the largest amphitheaters ever built,...

00:52.423 --> 00:54.255
...and one of the Seven Wonders of the World.
