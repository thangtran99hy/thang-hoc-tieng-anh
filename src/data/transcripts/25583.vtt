00:03.625 --> 00:04.973
Alright, thanks for coming guys.

00:05.075 --> 00:06.599
I just wanted to take a few minutes...

00:06.659 --> 00:09.613
...and talk about some ideas for the marketing strategy this year.

00:09.718 --> 00:12.377
So, if you got one, just throw it out there.

00:12.462 --> 00:12.893
I'd love to hear them.

00:12.993 --> 00:16.077
Yeah, how long is this meeting supposed to last?

00:16.171 --> 00:18.444
The schedule wasn't exactly clear.

00:19.291 --> 00:20.242
We should be out of here in 30.

00:20.458 --> 00:22.137
Is that approximate or...

00:22.380 --> 00:22.803
Hey guys!

00:22.933 --> 00:24.152
Sorry, I'm a couple of minutes late.

00:24.308 --> 00:25.263
I got caught in traffic.

00:25.959 --> 00:26.941
Seven minutes actually.

00:27.057 --> 00:27.391
What's that?

00:27.926 --> 00:28.502
A couple is two.

00:28.698 --> 00:32.065
So, what we're doing is we're just coming up with some ideas for our new marketing strategy so...

00:32.300 --> 00:33.009
...anyone?

00:33.129 --> 00:35.073
I think we should implement Pinterest.

00:35.195 --> 00:36.368
Oh, that's a fun idea!

00:36.474 --> 00:38.341
What about a publicity event in the park?

00:38.544 --> 00:39.184
Interesting.

00:39.643 --> 00:41.239
But, how are you gonna plan around the weather?

00:41.852 --> 00:42.551
What if it rains?

00:43.321 --> 00:44.867
So, we'll party in the rain.

00:44.978 --> 00:47.350
Okay, I just wanna emphasize, there's no bad ideas here.

00:47.470 --> 00:48.532
We're just brainstorming.

00:48.708 --> 00:51.100
Yeah, I'm just really thinking it'll be a huge waste of money...

00:51.179 --> 00:52.206
...to try to plan around the weather.

00:52.366 --> 00:54.645
Yeah! Okay we get your concerns, Nancy!

00:55.059 --> 00:55.506
Thank you!

00:57.617 --> 00:58.239
Hey, where are you all going?

00:59.523 --> 01:02.726
We still have 100% of the things to accomplish.
