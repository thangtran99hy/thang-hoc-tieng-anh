Allrecipes member Janice shares her recipe for iced coffee,...

00:04.487 --> 00:08.306
...saying it makes for a cooling pick-me-up of a coffee chocolate milkshake.

00:08.859 --> 00:12.149
Start by pouring half a cup of warm water into a small bowl.

00:16.636 --> 00:21.933
Add in two teaspoons of instant coffee granules and stir until the granules have dissolved.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.883
Pour the coffee into your blender.

00:27.316 --> 00:29.084
Add in one tray of ice cubes,...

00:33.208 --> 00:35.043
...together with a half cup of milk,...

00:40.476 --> 00:43.141
...two and a half ounces of sweetened condensed milk,...

00:51.511 --> 00:53.736
...and one tablespoon of chocolate syrup.

00:58.199 --> 01:00.083
Blend this mixture until smooth.

01:00.931 --> 01:03.469
Pour it into a glass and serve immediately.

01:04.048 --> 01:07.696
Garnish the iced coffee with whipped cream and chocolate shavings if desired.

Allrecipes member Lisa comments:

01:12.174 --> 01:14.891
"This is the best iced coffee I have ever had.

01:15.213 --> 01:18.577
I served this at a dinner party and everybody raved about it.

01:18.923 --> 01:20.864
No other recipe even compares."
