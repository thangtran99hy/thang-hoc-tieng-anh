00:01.245 --> 00:03.539
So, imagine a world parliament.

00:03.837 --> 00:10.158
Imagine 193 voices gathering together in New York to deliberate over matters of peace and security.

00:10.843 --> 00:15.770
The United Nations was established in 1945 with the signatory of 50 countries...

00:16.119 --> 00:22.270
...for the express purpose of preventing the outbreak of war and averting a world war.

00:22.713 --> 00:25.584
The United Nations has many parts to it.

00:26.029 --> 00:29.499
It deals, for instance, with matters of economics and social policy.

00:29.761 --> 00:32.815
It deals with matters of human rights, it deals with matters of culture.

00:33.313 --> 00:37.071
But the most important parts of the UN are the Security Council...

00:37.371 --> 00:41.655
...which has five permanent members who are responsible for controlling its policy.

00:41.875 --> 00:46.775
These are France, Britain, the United States, China and Russia.

00:47.621 --> 00:51.595
The other body that is very important is where all the nations meet and come together...

00:51.721 --> 00:53.207
...and that is the General Assembly.

00:53.476 --> 00:56.298
Both the General Assembly and the Security Council pass...

00:56.379 --> 00:59.429
...what are called resolutions to make policy for the world.

00:59.883 --> 01:04.129
The UN has been responsible for eradicating polio in Africa, for instance,...

01:04.593 --> 01:09.350
...of dealing with problems of debt or problems of other diseases spreading.

01:09.693 --> 01:13.568
The UN has been very important in making sure that human rights are observed.

01:13.897 --> 01:17.830
The most famous document is the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights,...

01:18.139 --> 01:20.934
...which has been ratified and kept by many countries.
