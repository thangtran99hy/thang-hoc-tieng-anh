00:00.532 --> 00:03.161
And the pitch, lined hard deep down the right field line.

00:03.309 --> 00:06.576
It is a fair ball, goes into the right field corner.

00:07.381 --> 00:09.434
Ichiro rounding third; they're gonna wave him.

00:09.637 --> 00:11.549
Here comes the throw home; he's gonna be out.

00:14.257 --> 00:14.631
Safe!

00:15.217 --> 00:17.919
Ichiro couldn't get tagged by Wieters.

00:18.225 --> 00:21.669
He ran around him, reached back for the plate and hit it.

00:21.857 --> 00:25.221
Unbelievable baserunning by Ichiro.

00:25.375 --> 00:27.459
It's a RBI double for Cano.

00:27.639 --> 00:29.681
And the Yankees take a 1-0 lead.

00:29.806 --> 00:32.500
Ichiro went around him, standing up.

00:32.787 --> 00:34.247
Wieters missed the tag.

00:34.502 --> 00:38.582
Now, Ichiro's on the other side of the plate, Wieters had another chance to tag,...

00:38.769 --> 00:42.587
...and Ichiro kind of dodged away from him and put his hand on the plate.

00:42.825 --> 00:44.575
A phenomenal bit of baserunning.
