Hi everyone!

00:01.303 --> 00:02.474
Welcome!

00:03.021 --> 00:08.655
Today, I'm gonna talk about how to train your dog and it's a very important lesson.

00:09.114 --> 00:11.743
So, pay attention everybody.

00:12.280 --> 00:16.935
With me today is my dog Kitsu.

00:18.207 --> 00:20.004
She is a Shiba Inu.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.095
Isn't she adorable?

00:23.054 --> 00:24.873
Hi Kitsu!

00:26.140 --> 00:29.923
The first thing that you have to know about training your dog...

00:30.008 --> 00:32.071
...is that you are the master...

00:33.463 --> 00:35.548
...and the dog has to listen to you.

00:36.152 --> 00:39.418
In order to show that you are the master,...

00:40.228 --> 00:46.562
...you have to stand straight and talk in a commanding voice like this.

00:47.209 --> 00:49.260
Kitsu, up!

00:53.563 --> 00:58.601
And you also have to give the dog rewards when they're doing good.

00:59.359 --> 01:02.641
And that's called positive reinforcement.
