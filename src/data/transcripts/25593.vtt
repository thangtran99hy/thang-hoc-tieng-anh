I walked into the kitchen yesterday and I said to my dad,...

00:05.802 --> 00:11.201
..."Hey, I'm hungry!" and my dad said, "Hi hungry, I'm Dad."

00:26.235 --> 00:30.355
Dad asked me, "Have you heard about the new movie 'Constipation'?"

00:31.755 --> 00:33.276
I was like, "What?"

00:33.812 --> 00:34.032
No.

00:35.949 --> 00:39.280
And he said, "It never came out."

00:42.072 --> 00:44.739
Who even calls a movie Constipation?

00:49.681 --> 00:52.801
My dad and I were going past the aquarium and he said to me,...

00:53.337 --> 00:56.078
..."How many tickles does it take to make an octopus laugh?"...

00:57.161 --> 00:58.893
...and he said, "Tentacles."

00:59.445 --> 01:00.569
Like what?

01:01.881 --> 01:04.307
Ah, tentacles.

01:08.109 --> 01:09.865
Hey Dad, can you make me a sandwich?

01:10.725 --> 01:11.533
And what did Dad say?

01:14.173 --> 01:18.191
Abracadabra, you are the sandwich.

01:25.385 --> 01:26.730
I guess I am a sandwich.
