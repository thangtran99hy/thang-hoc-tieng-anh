You are gonna have the most amazing birthday weekend.

00:13.710 --> 00:14.120
Wow!

00:15.865 --> 00:19.178
I haven't had the opportunity to come to New York and just enjoy it...

00:19.305 --> 00:21.325
...in a way that I got to with this trip.

00:22.093 --> 00:24.181
And certainly, New York is a strong city.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.629
We were there to try to find survivors...

00:26.757 --> 00:30.379
...and when our task force arrived in Ground Zero,...

00:30.702 --> 00:32.314
...I just couldn't believe the magnitude.

00:33.193 --> 00:37.807
I was just so grateful to have a canine partner that helped me get through it.

00:41.756 --> 00:45.314
We're so thrilled to have you here at 1 Hotel Central Park...

00:45.682 --> 00:50.583
...and we are even more excited to have Bretagne as our first Pup of Honor here.

00:50.967 --> 00:51.902
Happy birthday.

01:01.883 --> 01:03.209
Bretagne, look!

01:04.325 --> 01:05.553
Happy birthday, sweetie.

01:07.670 --> 01:08.796
Wow!

01:10.237 --> 01:11.872
Surprise!

01:12.605 --> 01:14.073
Happy birthday, Bretagne!

01:16.459 --> 01:18.752
Oh my gosh, what have you got here, Bretagne?

01:22.059 --> 01:28.110
A lot of dog handlers say you get that one dog and I've had several canine partners,...

01:28.239 --> 01:29.975
...but Bretagne is that one dog for me.
