00:00.050 --> 00:03.480
Around here, I'm lucky to get through a shift without a disaster.

00:03.881 --> 00:04.380
Heads up!

00:08.598 --> 00:10.216
You know what, don't worry about it.

00:10.392 --> 00:12.504
My bargain detergent couldn't keep up.

00:12.700 --> 00:14.073
It was mostly water.

00:14.291 --> 00:15.847
So, I switched to Tide PODS.

00:16.057 --> 00:18.909
They're super concentrated so I get a better clean.

00:19.739 --> 00:21.778
I mean, I give away water for free.

00:22.239 --> 00:24.352
I'm not about to pay for it in my detergent.

00:24.530 --> 00:27.157
15% cleaning ingredients or 90%?

00:27.257 --> 00:28.971
Don't pay for water, pay for clean.

00:29.106 --> 00:30.030
That's my Tide.
