My name's Marco Calzini and I live in Durham.

00:09.833 --> 00:13.097
My business is Adventure Valley in the Northeast of England.

00:14.156 --> 00:15.961
We've had Bertie just over four years.

00:16.167 --> 00:20.820
He was given to us by a lady who emigrated to a different country.

00:21.198 --> 00:23.079
And he's been with us ever since.

00:26.079 --> 00:27.501
Bertie loves his girlfriend Shelly.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.548
He lives with her all the time.

00:39.534 --> 00:41.389
And he loves to meet people, most of all.

00:41.575 --> 00:44.394
That's what he looks forward to, and that's when he puts on a good show.

00:49.101 --> 00:51.317
A lot of people noticed that he was very fast.

00:51.574 --> 00:54.711
So we then started to think, "Yeah, we might have something here."

00:55.297 --> 01:00.221
And we actually looked it up and realized, yes, he is an unusually fast tortoise.

01:01.018 --> 01:05.457
Everybody here is so proud, especially my wife Janine and all the staff.

01:05.655 --> 01:09.513
We're overwhelmed, and most of all, we're so proud of Bertie...

01:09.631 --> 01:11.209
...to be a Guinness World Record holder.
