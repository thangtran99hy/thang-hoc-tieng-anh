00:09.003 --> 00:10.862
ï»¿This is my new backpack.

00:11.495 --> 00:13.404
It really shows my personality.

00:13.513 --> 00:14.856
It has a lot of hearts.

00:20.717 --> 00:22.740
It's important to have a backpack...

00:22.845 --> 00:28.007
...because you go to school with lots of stuff to carry.

00:28.096 --> 00:32.624
You don't have a hundred arms, so how could you carry all of the things?

00:32.866 --> 00:34.286
You want to see what's in my backpack?

00:34.725 --> 00:35.921
There's a lot of stuff in it.

00:36.315 --> 00:37.413
I have my pens.

00:37.571 --> 00:38.661
Colored crayons.

00:38.943 --> 00:39.672
It's a troll.

00:40.352 --> 00:40.921
A worm.

00:41.809 --> 00:42.981
My butterfly.
