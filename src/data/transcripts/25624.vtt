The UN is in the news this week but not for keeping the peace.

00:06.766 --> 00:09.901
It was revealed this week that one of the UN's unpaid interns...

00:10.133 --> 00:11.771
...couldn't afford housing in Geneva,...

00:11.999 --> 00:14.245
...so he did what any adventurous soul would do.

00:14.679 --> 00:15.636
He slept in a tent.

00:16.275 --> 00:20.202
Although David Hyde, the 22-year-old intern from New Zealand, knew the circumstances...

00:20.274 --> 00:22.527
...when he accepted the role at the UN Conference...

00:22.835 --> 00:25.758
...he's now calling for interns around the world to unite...

00:25.824 --> 00:27.285
...to be counted and heard for their work,...

00:27.743 --> 00:31.847
...even citing the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights as to why.

00:32.117 --> 00:33.642
Now, maybe I'm a bit jaded.

00:33.906 --> 00:36.357
I worked in the media industry for my entire career,...

00:36.770 --> 00:39.469
...and the only way to break in was through unpaid internships.

00:39.639 --> 00:43.713
You found stipends, you had side jobs, you babysat, you made it work.
