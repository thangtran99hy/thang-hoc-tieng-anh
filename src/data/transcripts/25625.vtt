What do you look for in an antiperspirant?

00:02.541 --> 00:03.644
It just has to work.

00:03.941 --> 00:05.659
Dry is everything.

00:05.735 --> 00:07.733
Have you tried new Dove Advanced Care?

00:08.520 --> 00:09.519
Advanced Care?

00:09.605 --> 00:11.255
48 hours, wow.

00:11.550 --> 00:13.031
Just give it a try.

00:13.915 --> 00:14.653
It feels nice.

00:14.750 --> 00:16.093
Oh my gosh, okay.

00:16.197 --> 00:17.724
This is very, very smooth.

00:17.890 --> 00:19.483
I'm not messing around, it's soft.

00:19.801 --> 00:23.421
I did not know that antiperspirant could actually make my skin feel good.

00:23.739 --> 00:26.511
Your antiperspirant should give you more than just protection.

00:26.605 --> 00:27.921
New Dove Advanced Care.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.805
For softer, smoother underarms.
