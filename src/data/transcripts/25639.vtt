We'll not know enough to know which stocks to buy.

00:02.753 --> 00:04.780
They won't know enough to know when to buy them.

00:05.087 --> 00:05.986
But they don't have to...

00:06.478 --> 00:09.599
...because they can buy all of America through an index fund.

00:09.834 --> 00:12.751
And then they just have to be sure they don't jump in at exactly the wrong time.

00:12.831 --> 00:14.289
And they won't know what's exactly the wrong time...

00:14.418 --> 00:17.123
...so therefore, they should put their money in over a period of time.

00:17.211 --> 00:19.963
And they'll have some periods that are wonderful and some that weren't so good...

00:20.069 --> 00:22.135
...but overall, they will do fine over time.
