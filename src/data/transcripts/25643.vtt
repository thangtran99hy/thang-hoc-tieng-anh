When I'm looking for  the freshest apples in the store,...

00:02.545 --> 00:07.133
...I'm looking for something with no bruising, no scarring or frost marks down the side.

00:07.411 --> 00:09.160
I'm looking for uniformity in color.

00:09.409 --> 00:11.826
Generally, they're the ones that are on more on the outside of the tree,...

00:11.965 --> 00:16.457

00:17.143 --> 00:19.830
If you get a fresh apple and you love the smell of it,...

00:19.913 --> 00:21.206
...I think you're gonna love the flavor of it.
