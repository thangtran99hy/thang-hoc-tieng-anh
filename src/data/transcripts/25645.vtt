Hi, I'm Ian Somerhalder for the Humane Society of the United States.

00:04.959 --> 00:06.673
People love animals.

00:07.059 --> 00:11.385
And it's that shared value that malicious cruelty toward these creatures is just wrong.

00:11.860 --> 00:15.195
However, not too long ago, our laws didn't match our values.

00:16.584 --> 00:20.431
In the 1980s, only four states had felony penalties for animal cruelty.

00:21.353 --> 00:23.733
Only a dozen states had felony dogfighting laws...

00:23.836 --> 00:26.208
...and in some, cockfighting was still legal.

00:27.724 --> 00:30.936
That's why the Humane Society of the United States marched state by state...

00:31.193 --> 00:34.021
...and closed these gaps in the legal framework for animals.

00:35.403 --> 00:40.017
Protecting animals from the worst forms of cruelty is a part of a civil society.

00:40.976 --> 00:41.669
All right!

00:41.753 --> 00:42.447
There you go!

00:43.063 --> 00:45.368
And it's time for every nation in the world to have that.

00:46.668 --> 00:47.915
Help us make a reality.

00:48.710 --> 00:50.221
A humane society starts with you.
