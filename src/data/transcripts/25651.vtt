00:00.389 --> 00:00.767
No, no.

00:00.835 --> 00:01.725
It was the craziest thing because...

00:02.783 --> 00:04.480
The first idea was to do it in English,...

00:04.722 --> 00:07.726
...and I thought that I could speak English with an accent.

00:08.367 --> 00:11.668
I thought that I could do that.

00:11.801 --> 00:12.743
I was super skinny.

00:13.373 --> 00:13.494
Yeah.

00:13.861 --> 00:15.954
I was 40 pounds lighter.

00:16.193 --> 00:16.462
Yeah.

00:16.685 --> 00:18.575
And I didn't speak a word of Spanish.

00:18.727 --> 00:23.434
So, when they decided to do it, I was like, "These guys are crazy!"

00:24.453 --> 00:26.980
What I did was I flew myself.

00:28.315 --> 00:32.283
Netflix didn't even know I was being considered to play the part.

00:32.723 --> 00:37.069
But I flew myself to Medellin, to Colombia, in order to learn Spanish.

00:37.135 --> 00:40.665
And I booked myself in a university, in a Spanish course for foreigners.

00:41.199 --> 00:44.106
So, I was in a classroom with Japanese teenagers and...

00:45.251 --> 00:46.341
How crazy is that?

00:46.724 --> 00:47.767
And how much weight did you gain?

00:48.000 --> 00:48.751
40 pounds.

00:49.019 --> 00:49.410
Wow!

00:49.627 --> 00:49.865
Yeah.

00:50.011 --> 00:53.249
So, it's like being in school, learning things and eating delicious...

00:53.992 --> 00:54.937
...freshman ice cream, yeah.
