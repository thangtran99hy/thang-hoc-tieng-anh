Long ago, the town of Hamelin had a big problem of too many rats.

00:05.991 --> 00:09.315
The people tried every way to get rid of them, but in vain.

00:09.875 --> 00:13.731
The chief of the town declared to give ten sacks of gold...

00:14.079 --> 00:17.183
...to anyone who saved them from the rats.

00:19.210 --> 00:23.907
One day, a stranger from a faraway land came and told the chief...

00:24.316 --> 00:25.957
...that he would get rid of the rats.

00:26.660 --> 00:30.456
The stranger took out his pipe and played an odd tune.

00:30.855 --> 00:35.397
All the rats in the town heard the music and began to follow him.

00:37.259 --> 00:42.711
The clever man took them all to the river where all rats fell and drowned.

00:43.224 --> 00:46.099
Finally, Hamelin was free of rats.

00:46.717 --> 00:52.160
The pied piper went to collect his reward, but now that the problem was solved,...

00:52.526 --> 00:56.038
...the greedy chief refused to pay him any money.

00:58.036 --> 01:04.006
He immediately played his pipe again, this time every boy and girl of Hamelin...

01:04.315 --> 01:06.527
...began to follow the magical music.

01:06.930 --> 01:12.692
The pied piper took them all to a cave and closed it with a huge rock.

01:14.527 --> 01:19.235
Two children who were left behind went to the chief and told them what happened.

01:19.869 --> 01:23.973
The chief was very scared and ashamed of breaking his promise.

01:24.583 --> 01:27.577
He went to the cave and begged for forgiveness.

01:29.247 --> 01:33.535
He even promised to give the pied piper 20 sacks of gold.

01:34.200 --> 01:37.020
Finally, the pied piper let the children go.

01:37.574 --> 01:41.379
The town of Hamelin had learned never to be ungrateful again.
