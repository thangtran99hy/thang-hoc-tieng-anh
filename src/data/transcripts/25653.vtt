00:00.195 --> 00:05.465
There once lived a poor woodcutter, his wife and two children Hansel and Gretel.

00:06.143 --> 00:09.645
The woodcutter and his wife could not take care of the children anymore.

00:10.078 --> 00:12.771
They decided to leave them in the middle of the forest.

00:14.663 --> 00:18.216
Hansel and Gretel heard this and were very scared.

00:18.772 --> 00:23.181
They came up with a plan of dropping pebbles along the way their father took them.

00:23.872 --> 00:27.634
All they had to do was follow the line of pebbles back home.

00:29.573 --> 00:33.859
Their parents were surprised to see them and decided to take them again.

00:34.389 --> 00:39.577
Hansel and Gretel decided to drop bread crumbs this time as their pebbles were gone.

00:40.120 --> 00:44.841
But sadly for the children, the animals and birds ate up all the crumbs.

00:46.867 --> 00:50.535
They walked and walked but couldn't find their way back home.

00:51.157 --> 00:57.513
Suddenly, they saw a strange house made up of cookies, candies and chocolates.

00:57.983 --> 01:03.098
Just as Hansel and Gretel were eating the yummy door, a witch pounced on them.

01:04.867 --> 01:09.352
She locked up Hansel in a cage and asked Gretel to help her heat the oven.

01:09.747 --> 01:11.855
She would cook them and eat them up.

01:12.161 --> 01:15.666
But just as the witch bent to check the oven's temperature,...

01:15.877 --> 01:19.637
...Gretel pushed her from behind and locked the oven door.

01:21.385 --> 01:25.762
Gretel rescued Hansel, and they filled their pockets with the witch's jewels.

01:26.062 --> 01:28.796
Finally, they managed to find their way back home...

01:29.065 --> 01:30.968
...and gave the jewels to their parents.

01:31.505 --> 01:35.972
Thanks to the clever children, the family was never poor and hungry again.
