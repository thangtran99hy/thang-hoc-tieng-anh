ï»¿What makes you itch?

00:05.706 --> 00:08.969
What sort of a situation would you like?

00:11.501 --> 00:15.483
Let's suppose I do this often in vocational guidance of students.

00:16.272 --> 00:20.300
They come to me and say, "Well, we're getting out of college...

00:20.383 --> 00:22.629
...and we haven't the faintest idea what we want to do."

00:24.448 --> 00:28.869
So, I always ask the question, "What would you like to do if money were no object?"

00:31.266 --> 00:33.798
"How would you really enjoy spending your life?"

00:36.057 --> 00:39.371
Well, it's so amazing, as a result of our kind of educational system,...

00:39.467 --> 00:42.429
...crowds of students say "Well, we'd like to be painters."

00:42.531 --> 00:43.595
"We'd like to be poets."

00:43.713 --> 00:44.632
"We'd like to be writers."

00:44.733 --> 00:46.985
"But as everybody knows, you can't earn any money that way."

00:47.882 --> 00:51.116
Another person says, "Well, I'd like to live an out of doors life and ride horses."

00:52.356 --> 00:54.038
I said, "You want to teach in a riding school?"

00:57.109 --> 00:57.904
Let's go through with it.

00:58.023 --> 00:58.651
What do you want to do?
