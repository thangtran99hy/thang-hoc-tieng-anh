ï»¿Welcome to the wonderful Iguazu Falls.

00:04.048 --> 00:09.307
The splendor of the falls with its misty rainbows is almost overwhelming.

00:10.035 --> 00:13.306
There is simply nothing else like it in the world.

00:23.898 --> 00:27.944
Millions of years ago, natural forces split up the Earth's crust,...

00:28.331 --> 00:32.525
...creating what the indigenous Guarani people called "The Great Waters".

00:33.879 --> 00:42.898
Iguazu Falls is 1.7 miles wide and is not one but an astonishing 275 waterfalls.

00:43.857 --> 00:48.536
Eighty percent of the falls lies in Argentina and 20% in Brazil.

01:00.777 --> 01:03.119

01:03.368 --> 01:05.737

01:05.867 --> 01:08.562
...or, if you're feeling brave, on the top of the falls.

01:09.179 --> 01:12.569
Feel humbled by the power of the tumbling water mass below you.

01:13.153 --> 01:18.325
In the wet season, a maximum of nearly 13,000 cubic meters of water,...

01:18.531 --> 01:24.909
...that's 450,000 cubic feet, thunders over the combined falls each second.
