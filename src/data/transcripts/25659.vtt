If you doubt America's commitment or mine to see that justice is done,...

00:04.602 --> 00:05.941
...just ask Osama Bin Laden.

00:14.478 --> 00:18.633
Ask the leader of Al-Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year.

00:19.256 --> 00:23.615
Or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.899
When you come after Americans, we go after you.

00:28.110 --> 00:32.697
And it may take time, but we have long memories and our reach has no limits.
