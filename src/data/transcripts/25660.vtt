So, tonight I'm announcing a new national effort to get it done,...

00:06.042 --> 00:08.537
...and because he's gone to the mat for all of us...

00:08.645 --> 00:10.614
...on so many issues over the past 40 years,...

00:10.984 --> 00:12.925
...I'm putting Joe in charge of mission control.

00:15.790 --> 00:17.902
For the loved ones we've all lost.

00:18.929 --> 00:21.439
For the families that we can still save.

00:21.632 --> 00:24.717
Let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.
