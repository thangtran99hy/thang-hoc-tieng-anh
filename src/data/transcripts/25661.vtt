I wouldn't change the 10-dollar bill or the 20-dollar bill.

00:03.185 --> 00:04.851
I think honestly it's a gesture.

00:04.935 --> 00:06.933
I don't think it helps to change our history.

00:07.041 --> 00:10.184
What I would think is that we ought to recognize...

00:10.263 --> 00:11.977
...that women are not a special interest group.

00:12.489 --> 00:14.625
Women are the majority of this nation.

00:15.032 --> 00:16.948
We are half the potential of this nation.

00:17.283 --> 00:19.712
And this nation will be better off when every woman...

00:19.999 --> 00:22.369
...has the opportunity to live the life she chooses.
