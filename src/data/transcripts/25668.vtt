Hi, I'm really excited to meet you.

00:08.625 --> 00:10.918
I saw in your daughter's blog that she has a gluten allergy...

00:11.035 --> 00:13.117
...so I got these gluten-free cookies. I hope she likes them.

00:13.783 --> 00:14.657
I'm a crazy stalker.

00:14.740 --> 00:15.546
Don't let me into your life.

00:16.482 --> 00:19.823
I'm sorry, I didn't bring any copies of my resume with me.

00:20.578 --> 00:22.479
I actually care so little about this job...

00:22.557 --> 00:24.243
...I didn't even bother to print something out.

00:25.105 --> 00:26.654
Sorry I'm late, dude. Traffic.

00:28.055 --> 00:29.551
I just don't care about your time.

00:32.647 --> 00:34.255
What kind of medical insurance do you provide?

00:34.587 --> 00:36.363
I have cholera and I want you to pay for it.

00:36.944 --> 00:38.647
What's your vacation policy like?

00:39.214 --> 00:41.265
I can't wait to not be at my new job.

00:42.056 --> 00:43.347
Do you think I'll get an office?

00:43.736 --> 00:46.105
I want all the things I don't deserve.

00:48.024 --> 00:50.088
I really want this job.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.890
I'm the most desperate person you've ever met..

00:51.957 --> 00:54.691
...and I'm like five seconds away from grabbing your hand and begging.

00:55.307 --> 00:57.359
I'm a team player and I'm a people person.

00:57.592 --> 01:00.386
All I have to offer you are cliches.

01:00.836 --> 01:03.927
I'm not really looking right now but I would consider taking it...

01:04.150 --> 01:05.117
...if the price is right.

01:05.417 --> 01:07.975
Yeah, I'm gonna start looking for a job from my desk...

01:08.084 --> 01:08.870
...the second you hire me.

01:09.237 --> 01:10.248
Do you know anyone, actually?
