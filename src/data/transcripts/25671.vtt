One of the best loved British actors of all time, Alan Rickman,...

00:05.957 --> 00:07.783
...has passed away at his home in London.

00:08.047 --> 00:11.057
Rickman was 69 and had been suffering from cancer.

00:11.282 --> 00:14.779
Although he turned to professional acting fairly late in life,...

00:15.009 --> 00:18.055
...Rickman had a phenomenal career spanning 30 years...

00:18.161 --> 00:21.763
...and delivered some tremendous performances both on stage and screen.

00:21.952 --> 00:24.956
He first came to the public's attention in 1988,...

00:25.083 --> 00:27.825
...playing the role of Hans Gruber in "Die Hard."

00:28.075 --> 00:31.445
His starring role as Jamie in "Truly, Madly, Deeply"...

00:31.657 --> 00:34.584
...and then his turn as the Sheriff of Nottingham in "Robin Hood:...

00:34.739 --> 00:38.899
...Prince of Thieves" cemented his status as a sublimely talented actor.

00:39.252 --> 00:42.847
Of all his work, it was perhaps his role as Snape in "Harry Potter"...

00:42.926 --> 00:44.134
...which stood out the most.

00:44.413 --> 00:46.683
Although Rickman disliked being cast as a villain,...

00:46.838 --> 00:50.957
...he made Snape a character we all loved to hate and hated to love.
