Today, I'm starting a new series.

00:01.709 --> 00:04.229
I'm gonna be talking about tough topics with grownups.

00:04.331 --> 00:06.439
Today's tough topic: how to be a hero.

00:06.617 --> 00:10.322
And today's grownup: Tim Honks!

00:10.591 --> 00:11.119
Yes.

00:12.323 --> 00:14.094
Excuse me, Mr. Kid President.

00:14.489 --> 00:16.067
My name is not Tim Honks.

00:16.177 --> 00:17.939
I have a couple questions for you.

00:18.043 --> 00:20.439
Wow. That is a lot of questions.

00:20.561 --> 00:23.369
This is a tough question and I got to figure this out.

00:23.482 --> 00:25.935
How can I be a hero to somebody and what can I do today?

00:26.567 --> 00:27.655
That's interesting.

00:29.711 --> 00:32.448
The option is probably there, Mr. Kid President.

00:33.006 --> 00:36.909
Now maybe, it would just be cutting somebody some slack.

00:37.101 --> 00:38.825
They've had a tough day and they need a break...

00:39.039 --> 00:42.120
..and you could say, "Hey it's alright, don't worry. I'm okay, I can wait."

00:42.280 --> 00:46.582
Something else might be something bigger than that, like returning something that was lost.

00:46.967 --> 00:50.834
I found this and rather than rifle the contents of this wallet or purse,...

00:50.907 --> 00:53.621
...I'm gonna look at one thing in it, one thing only,...

00:53.705 --> 00:55.960
...and that is the driver's license of who it belongs to.

00:56.297 --> 00:59.356
And then, you'd somehow get it back to them.

00:59.506 --> 01:03.097
Those are small little acts of heroism but they're the right things to do.
