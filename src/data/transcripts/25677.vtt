The guy texts you really late at night.

00:06.821 --> 00:07.721
Why would he do that?

00:07.931 --> 00:09.488
'Cause maybe he likes you?

00:09.646 --> 00:12.924
I think maybe he is sleeping.

00:14.471 --> 00:15.800
And he's a sleepyhead?

00:15.901 --> 00:16.254
Cool!

00:17.402 --> 00:18.757
Do you guys know what ghosting is?

00:19.030 --> 00:23.075
Like, if you have one boy and if you're scaring him,...

00:23.175 --> 00:25.111
...it's like you're both scaring each other.

00:25.343 --> 00:29.404
If I like a boy, should I take a selfie and send it to him?

00:29.585 --> 00:31.298
And then he might text you back.

00:31.391 --> 00:35.989
If he doesn't text me back, should I text him and say,...

00:36.099 --> 00:37.469
"You're being totally rude."

00:37.774 --> 00:40.439
You could just say, "You used to talk to me."

00:40.543 --> 00:42.356
"You're ghosting me."

00:42.990 --> 00:44.134
And then he would know.

00:44.240 --> 00:45.487
You guys are best friends, right?

00:45.649 --> 00:45.919
Yeah.

00:49.744 --> 00:51.167
Okay. Well, I'll let you have a moment.

00:51.465 --> 00:53.961
Do you think it's okay for girls to ask guys on dates?

00:54.245 --> 00:55.555
Of course it is.

00:55.673 --> 01:00.860
The guys say they should go out on a date, so both of it's okay.

01:00.959 --> 01:02.407
So, yes, it is okay.
