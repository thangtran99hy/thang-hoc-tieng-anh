Soccer fans in Japan are surprised and disappointed at the news that...

00:04.093 --> 00:07.431
...Homare Sawa is going to retire at the end of this season.

00:08.037 --> 00:10.767
She's been on the national team for more than 20 years.

00:12.601 --> 00:15.705
Sawa first played for the national squad at age 15.

00:15.989 --> 00:19.643
She went to the United States in 1999, pioneering the practice...

00:19.708 --> 00:23.033
...of Japanese female players signing to foreign clubs.

00:24.406 --> 00:29.166
Sawa was the team's captain in the Women's World Cup finals in Germany four years ago.

00:29.783 --> 00:34.189
Japan won the championship with Sawa becoming the tournament's top scorer...

00:34.275 --> 00:35.673
...and most valuable player.

00:36.693 --> 00:40.337
I did my utmost, feeling this could be my last World Cup.

00:40.779 --> 00:42.479
So, I don't have any regrets.
