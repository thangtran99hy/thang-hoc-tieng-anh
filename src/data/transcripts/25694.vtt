There, in the largest dictionary of English which is the Oxford English Dictionary,...

00:05.054 --> 00:09.863
...there is more than 600,000 word families in the dictionary.

00:10.108 --> 00:13.242
And "word families" means all of the different kinds of a word.

00:13.309 --> 00:16.983
So, "accept," "accepting," "acceptable," "accepts," that's all one word.

00:17.070 --> 00:20.301
So, there's actually millions of words in the English language.

00:20.370 --> 00:23.136
It's an enormous, almost incomprehensible number.

00:24.269 --> 00:29.424
But fortunately, for us, not all words are created equally.

00:30.210 --> 00:36.416
Fortunately for us, native speakers on average use far less than 600,000.

00:37.211 --> 00:42.674
If, for example, you were to measure the vocabulary size of a native speaker of English...

00:42.759 --> 00:44.694
...who grew up in an English-speaking country,...

00:45.131 --> 00:49.257
...somebody who's gone on all the way through to college,...

00:49.715 --> 00:51.291
...by the time they've graduated college,...

00:51.367 --> 00:55.284
...they've mastered somewhere between 25 and 30,000 words of English.

00:55.400 --> 01:00.015
So, in other words, only about 5% of the English language.

01:00.801 --> 01:02.727
Now, that's really good.

01:03.237 --> 01:08.650
30,000 is a lot less than 600,000, but what about second language learners of English?

01:09.113 --> 01:12.971
I'm working here in Japan, and I'm always worried about the needs of my students.

01:13.049 --> 01:17.407
And the news is not quite as good here.

01:18.064 --> 01:20.443
If we look at, for example, Japanese students...

01:20.778 --> 01:24.569
...after they've studied English for a total of 14 years:...

01:24.672 --> 01:27.455
...two years in elementary school, three years in junior high,...

01:27.565 --> 01:29.431
...three in senior high and four in college.

01:29.842 --> 01:34.771
After 14 years of study, they only know about 2,000 words of English.

01:35.924 --> 01:39.932
That's far less than the 30,000 that native speakers know.

01:40.373 --> 01:43.899
And this is not a problem that is just only happening in Japan.

01:43.971 --> 01:47.314
I mean, second language learners of English all around the world...

01:47.440 --> 01:48.824
...suffer from the same kind of numbers.

01:48.890 --> 01:52.439
After hundreds of hours of study and years of study,...

01:52.789 --> 01:57.202
...they are still not even close to the level of native speakers.
