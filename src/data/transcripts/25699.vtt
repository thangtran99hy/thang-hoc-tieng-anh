My name is Angela and I am a freelance consultant specializing in digital analytics.

00:10.535 --> 00:11.968
Data can't talk to you, right?

00:12.053 --> 00:14.267
It's not a person you can go like, "How are you feeling today?" ...

00:14.357 --> 00:17.265
...and says, "I feel like I'm under the weather and I kinda have a cough."

00:17.503 --> 00:18.744
I make things easier to find.

00:18.831 --> 00:20.134
I make information accessible.

00:20.217 --> 00:22.088
I help companies serve their customers better.

00:22.923 --> 00:27.133
I know this sounds ridiculous, but I wake up in the morning thinking about math all the time.

00:27.261 --> 00:31.503
I'm thinking of this sphere of data that you can turn around in your mind...

00:31.577 --> 00:33.417
...and get all these different perspectives on it.

00:34.878 --> 00:36.245
People would ask me what I did for a living...

00:36.407 --> 00:39.527
...and somewhere it just dawned on me like, I'm kinda like a math detective,...

00:39.605 --> 00:42.030
...like I'm solving mysteries but with math.

00:42.535 --> 00:45.557
My job is just completely in sync with how I see the world.

00:46.167 --> 00:46.690
I just love it.

00:46.779 --> 00:47.869
I love every second of it.
