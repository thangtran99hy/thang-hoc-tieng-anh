Your LinkedIn headline is your personal billboard.

00:05.250 --> 00:06.837
It describes what you do.

00:06.963 --> 00:08.335
So, make it count.

00:08.785 --> 00:10.464
Say, you're a landscape designer.

00:10.593 --> 00:12.541
Your first thought might be to use your title,...

00:13.377 --> 00:17.329
...but he's also a landscape designer and so is she.

00:17.811 --> 00:20.151
So, how can you stand out from the crowd?

00:20.585 --> 00:25.428
Use your LinkedIn headline to show off your unique expertise like ecological design.

00:27.136 --> 00:30.898
While you're at it, why not add your passions like beekeeping?

00:32.481 --> 00:37.665
Congratulations, you now have a LinkedIn headline that sets you apart from your peers.
