A few years ago, a new kind of pop star burst onto the music scene in Japan.

00:04.523 --> 00:08.096
They're called Vocaloids, and they're basically singers made out of software.

00:08.861 --> 00:10.479
Vocaloids aren't human at all.

00:10.747 --> 00:15.016
They're crowdsourced creations made by their fans who use special music programs...

00:15.090 --> 00:16.801
...to write songs in a synthetic voice...

00:17.157 --> 00:20.201
...and perform them using animated avatars or holograms.

00:21.363 --> 00:25.989
The most famous Vocaloid, Hatsune Miku, has become a national celebrity in Japan...

00:26.197 --> 00:29.552
...with sold-out concerts and millions of dollars in merchandise sales.

00:29.989 --> 00:33.215
Some Vocaloid fans are trying to bring the phenomenon to the US,...

00:33.529 --> 00:36.397
...but can Americans be charmed by synthetic pop stars?
