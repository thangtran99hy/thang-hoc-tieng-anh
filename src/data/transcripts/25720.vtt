00:00.740 --> 00:01.701
Take a look at this chart.

00:02.280 --> 00:05.871
On the left, several nations like Luxembourg, Norway and Switzerland...

00:06.211 --> 00:08.265
...save 1/3 or more of their GDP a year...

00:08.603 --> 00:13.530
...while on the right, countries like the US, Portugal and Greece save less than 1/5.

00:14.277 --> 00:17.527
So, what is it about some countries that make them more frugal than others?

00:18.353 --> 00:20.983
Chen thinks the answer may be language.

00:21.554 --> 00:24.117
The highlighted countries speak "futureless" languages,...

00:24.425 --> 00:26.667
...meaning they aren't forced to grammatically differentiate...

00:26.768 --> 00:28.851
...between the present and future when speaking.

00:29.479 --> 00:33.259
For example, if I were telling you the forecast for tomorrow in English, I'd say...

00:33.763 --> 00:35.215
"It's going to rain tomorrow."

00:36.131 --> 00:38.357
Whereas, if I were speaking in German, I'd say...

00:38.473 --> 00:41.771
"Morgen regnet es" or "Tomorrow, it rains."

00:42.685 --> 00:44.658
In a "futured" language like English,...

00:44.972 --> 00:48.060
...speakers form a verbal distinction between "now" and "later"...

00:48.245 --> 00:50.783
...by saying "it's going to" or "it will."

00:51.289 --> 00:54.229
Chen thinks that speakers who aren't forced to make this separation...

00:54.638 --> 00:56.409
...subconsciously associate the two.

00:57.030 --> 00:59.824
And if you think identically about the present and future,...

01:00.139 --> 01:03.205
...you're probably going to make smarter, future-oriented decisions...

01:03.309 --> 01:05.820
...about things like say, saving money.

01:06.435 --> 01:08.379
And the difference can be significant too.

01:08.926 --> 01:10.981
The Chinese who speak a "futureless" language...

01:11.293 --> 01:15.680
...have saved an average of 25% more than Americans over the last 30 years.
