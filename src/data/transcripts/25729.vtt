Ninh explains the rules of kabaddi.

00:02.977 --> 00:06.460
Kabaddi is an Indian sport played with two teams of 12 players,...

00:06.693 --> 00:09.349
...with seven players taking to the court at any one time.

00:09.977 --> 00:11.527
The game is played on a rectangular court...

00:11.616 --> 00:14.991
...that's generally a maximum of 30 meters by 10 meters.

00:15.141 --> 00:17.657
This is a midline that divides the court into two,...

00:17.863 --> 00:21.561
...and these are the baulk lines, the end lines, the bonus lines...

00:21.849 --> 00:23.412
...and this is the lobby area.

00:23.847 --> 00:25.389
I'll explain what these are shortly.

00:26.475 --> 00:29.654
The object of the game is for your team to score more points than the opposing team.

00:30.089 --> 00:33.357
To score, a team must send a player, known as a raider,...

00:33.609 --> 00:35.201
...into the opposing half of the court...

00:35.483 --> 00:37.713
...whilst chanting the word "kabaddi" repeatedly.

00:38.839 --> 00:42.733
A raider must only use one breath and chant the word "kabaddi" repeatedly...

00:42.978 --> 00:46.183
...to show the referee that he is exhaling and not holding his breath.

00:47.517 --> 00:50.102
The first goal of the raider is to reach the baulk line.

00:50.931 --> 00:53.357
Failure to do this results in the raider being out,...

00:53.513 --> 00:55.896
...and cannot participate in the next part of the game.

00:56.980 --> 00:59.572
The second goal of the raider is to touch as many players as he can...

00:59.707 --> 01:03.668
...and make it back to the midline before he is caught and tackled by the defenders.

01:04.599 --> 01:06.215
He can do this in several ways.

01:06.679 --> 01:10.283
With a hand touch, a toe touch, a kick...

01:10.716 --> 01:13.368
...or by trying to escape a tackle and reaching for the midline.

01:14.183 --> 01:17.101
He gets one point for every opposing defender that he touches...

01:17.279 --> 01:18.867
...so long as he makes it back to the midline,...

01:19.145 --> 01:21.478
...all whilst repeatedly chanting the word "kabaddi."

01:22.441 --> 01:27.056
And any touched defenders are out and cannot participate in the next round of play.
