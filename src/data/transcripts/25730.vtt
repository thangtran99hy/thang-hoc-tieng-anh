Despite the stereotypically female following,...

00:05.730 --> 00:08.731
...yoga has been used by professional athletes for years...

00:08.861 --> 00:12.793
...to increase flexibility, improve balance and focus the mind.

00:13.209 --> 00:15.925
No athlete wants to be an inflexible mess,...

00:16.064 --> 00:19.911
...but it can be hard for men to imagine themselves in complicated poses.

00:20.143 --> 00:23.933
So, here are my favorite yoga moves for the physically active man.

00:24.499 --> 00:28.573
Downward-facing dog strengthens the arms, legs and core...

00:28.832 --> 00:31.229
...while stretching your shoulders, hamstrings and calves.

00:31.602 --> 00:35.721
Make sure that your weight is evenly distributed between your legs and your arms...

00:35.839 --> 00:37.383
...to get the full effect of the move.

00:37.696 --> 00:41.515
If you can do only one pose a day, start with downward dog.

00:42.037 --> 00:47.024
The bridge is easy for beginners and stretches the chest, neck, spine and hips.

00:47.487 --> 00:50.947
Tight chest muscles can limit lung capacity, and over time,...

00:51.232 --> 00:54.397
...this pose can improve performance in all physical activities...

00:54.597 --> 00:57.363
...and help relieve symptoms of upper respiratory issues.

00:57.854 --> 01:01.483
The boat is ideal for strengthening your core and back muscles...

01:01.768 --> 01:05.039
...as well as promoting healthy thyroid and prostate gland function.

01:05.327 --> 01:07.853
While beginners may need to use a hand on the floor,...

01:08.119 --> 01:10.572
...your balance will improve before you know it.
