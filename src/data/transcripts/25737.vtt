00:00.661 --> 00:03.779
ï»¿Imagine there's no heaven.

00:06.701 --> 00:09.917
It's easy if you try.

00:13.279 --> 00:16.323
No hell below us,...

00:20.219 --> 00:25.238
...above us only sky.

00:25.873 --> 00:29.133
Imagine all the people...

00:31.537 --> 00:38.733
...living for today.

00:39.218 --> 00:42.437
Imagine there's no countries.

00:45.110 --> 00:48.693
It isn't hard to do.

00:51.643 --> 00:54.957
Nothing to kill or die for...

00:57.795 --> 01:00.941
...and no religion, too.

01:04.109 --> 01:07.527
Imagine all the people...

01:09.673 --> 01:14.449
...living life in peace.

01:17.253 --> 01:20.405
You may say I'm a dreamer,...

01:23.343 --> 01:25.891
...but I'm not the only one.

01:29.326 --> 01:35.401
I hope someday you will join us.

01:36.267 --> 01:41.536
And the world will be as one.
