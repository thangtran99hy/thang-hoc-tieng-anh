Now that you've entered the presidential race and started raising money,...

00:03.779 --> 00:05.301
...how can you tell if you are succeeding?

00:05.985 --> 00:08.985
One way is through polls, which measure public opinion.

00:09.984 --> 00:11.982
Polling data is collected in part by...

00:12.275 --> 00:15.827
...phone calls, online surveys and social media traffic.

00:16.749 --> 00:19.593
But what determines whether a candidate will do well in the polls?

00:20.546 --> 00:23.431
One way to gain support is through televised debates.

00:24.106 --> 00:26.993
Depending on how well candidates express their views on topics...

00:27.096 --> 00:30.802
...such as the economy, foreign policy and social issues,...

00:31.234 --> 00:33.541
...their poll numbers will go up or down.

00:34.165 --> 00:37.347
Some candidates may not be popular in every area of the US,...

00:37.849 --> 00:41.291
...which means they'll have to travel to strategic locations across the country...

00:41.387 --> 00:42.883
...to strengthen their poll numbers.

00:43.301 --> 00:47.492
If they're successful, all that campaigning will result in improved popularity...

00:47.788 --> 00:49.201
...and positive media coverage.

00:49.784 --> 00:52.560
And if they're not, they may not make it to the next stage...

00:52.767 --> 00:55.066
...when voters actually begin the election process,...

00:55.231 --> 00:58.426
...during the primaries and caucuses that are held in each state.
