00:01.234 --> 00:05.158
ï»¿The process of choosing a president formally begins with the primary election...

00:05.500 --> 00:07.385
...when each party chooses a nominee.

00:08.041 --> 00:13.846
During this process, each state holds its own vote called either a "primary" or a "caucus."

00:14.617 --> 00:17.367
The first caucus is traditionally in Iowa.

00:18.203 --> 00:23.286
In a caucus, citizens gather in a public space to debate issues and share concerns.

00:23.811 --> 00:25.076
They then choose a candidate.

00:25.836 --> 00:27.917
The results from each district are then tallied...

00:28.123 --> 00:29.752
...to determine a statewide outcome.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.835
The first primary is in New Hampshire.

00:33.526 --> 00:38.026
A primary is like a regular election, where citizens cast ballots at a voting center.

00:38.848 --> 00:43.591
One important date is "Super Tuesday," when lots of states vote on the same day.

00:44.379 --> 00:47.911
These state primaries and caucuses then continue until around mid-year.

00:48.878 --> 00:52.743
A winner usually emerges even before all the nominating contests are over.

00:53.275 --> 00:57.701
But it's not official until later at each party's national political convention.
