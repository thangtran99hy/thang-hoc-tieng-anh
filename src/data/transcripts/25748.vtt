00:00.355 --> 00:02.768
ï»¿Fashion used to be sold in four seasons.

00:02.935 --> 00:05.456
Zara wants you to buy for 104.

00:05.786 --> 00:08.335
New clothes arrive in every store twice a week...

00:08.473 --> 00:10.663
...days known by fans as "Z Days."

00:11.501 --> 00:16.091
Customers visit Zara on average six times more often than its competitors...

00:16.279 --> 00:19.463
...causing rival stores to dread its arrival on their turf.

00:19.917 --> 00:22.305
When Zara opened a store in China last year,...

00:22.648 --> 00:26.685
...one industry commentator noted, "It just murdered everything around it."

00:27.052 --> 00:31.046
And when the doors of Zara's first Australian store opened in Sydney in April,...

00:31.353 --> 00:34.987
...80% of the stock was snapped up within three minutes.

00:35.640 --> 00:39.319
Shoppers might love Zara but fashion's elite are not so happy.

00:39.791 --> 00:41.570
One unnamed designer complained...

00:41.915 --> 00:45.059
..."we spend a fortune researching and working up ideas,...

00:45.285 --> 00:48.192
...then Zara comes along and walks off with them for nothing."

00:49.194 --> 00:53.193
Zara has achieved global success with almost zero advertising...

00:53.624 --> 00:56.221
...which its founder calls a "pointless distraction."

00:56.989 --> 01:00.389
Zara: fast, affordable, pre-packaged fashion.

01:00.655 --> 01:02.083
A business built on speed.

01:02.404 --> 01:03.793
Designed for addiction.
