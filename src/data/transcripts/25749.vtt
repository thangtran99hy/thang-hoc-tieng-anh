00:08.877 --> 00:15.329
This is your first win in any Grand Slam Main Draw on the 15th attempt.

00:22.101 --> 00:24.467
I want to say thank you to my coach, my parents.

00:27.587 --> 00:30.416
Thank you everybody who came to support me.

00:30.534 --> 00:31.119
Thank you.

00:32.353 --> 00:34.463
I just try to focus.

00:35.378 --> 00:38.177
I don't want to think about winning or losing...

00:38.478 --> 00:43.092
...because always, you think, "Okay, last point."

00:43.327 --> 00:45.568
"If you win this point, you win the match."

00:45.995 --> 00:47.975
Sometimes you lose the whole match.

00:48.154 --> 00:52.935
So, I don't want to lose the focus.

00:53.175 --> 00:55.859
And I want to concentrate on the last point.

00:56.505 --> 01:00.619
I just want to show the best of Zhang Shuai in this match.

01:03.402 --> 01:08.623
Before the match I think this is, in my life, maybe the last match.

01:09.427 --> 01:14.197
I try to do my best in the match.

01:14.465 --> 01:15.763
I want to try my best.

01:15.907 --> 01:18.267
I want to show the best of Zhang Shuai.

01:21.230 --> 01:23.967
I think I did a great job today.
