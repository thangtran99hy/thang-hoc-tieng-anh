If you're an average CEO in the 1950s,...

00:02.648 --> 00:05.507
...you're making about 20 times more than a typical worker.

00:06.061 --> 00:08.352
In the 1980s, about 42 times more.

00:08.816 --> 00:11.968
Today, between 200 and 270 times more...

00:12.043 --> 00:16.786
...and last year's most unequal CEO was JCPenney's Ron Johnson.

00:17.334 --> 00:21.616
He earned 1900 times more than his typical worker.

00:22.333 --> 00:25.898
CEO pay has exploded in the last few decades, that's obvious.

00:26.508 --> 00:31.626
But is it because CEOs are more valuable or because they are just being paid more?

00:32.693 --> 00:34.179
Well, the answer is both.

00:35.156 --> 00:39.621
America's corporations are bigger and more complicated than they were 50 years ago.

00:40.421 --> 00:43.289
The biggest U.S. Company in 1955 was General Motors.

00:43.470 --> 00:45.688
Its revenue was 90 billion in today's dollars...

00:45.813 --> 00:49.805
...and it had hundreds of thousands of employees, mostly in North America.

00:50.883 --> 00:55.025
Today, there are 20 American companies with more than 90 billion in revenue.

00:55.519 --> 00:59.853
And many of them like Walmart or GE have half or more of their employees...

00:59.938 --> 01:01.161
...working outside the US.

01:01.837 --> 01:05.379
If you're at the helm of one of America's most important corporations these days,...

01:05.913 --> 01:07.658
...you're acting on the world stage.

01:08.268 --> 01:09.175
It's a bigger job.

01:09.936 --> 01:14.237
But the second reason CEOs are paid more is that they're paid differently.

01:14.979 --> 01:16.594
They're more likely to be compensated...

01:16.687 --> 01:19.825
...with something a little more valuable than old-fashioned salary.

01:20.611 --> 01:24.921
Stock options now account for half the typical pay package...

01:25.288 --> 01:27.011
...of America's leading CEOs.
