OptiKey is a piece of software that I've developed for Windows.

00:04.678 --> 00:06.649
When paired with an eye tracking device,...

00:06.744 --> 00:11.131
...it allows you full computer control and speech generation using only your eyes.

00:11.294 --> 00:14.952
It's designed for people with motor and speech limitations,...

00:15.039 --> 00:18.004
...specifically people with motor neuron disease or ALS.

00:19.013 --> 00:20.567
OptiKey is free, a hundred percent.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.988
It's fully free, fully open source forever.

00:23.233 --> 00:27.449
I decided very early on that this wasn't gonna be a profit-making exercise.

00:28.808 --> 00:33.885
I had an aunt who died about four and a bit years ago from motor neuron disease,...

00:33.991 --> 00:37.137
...and I sort of took two things away from the whole experience.

00:37.370 --> 00:40.707
One was how horrible these sort of degenerative diseases can be.

00:41.151 --> 00:44.970
And the second thing was that the solutions available to help people communicate...

00:45.404 --> 00:48.193
...as they're losing their faculties and losing control of their body,...

00:48.949 --> 00:52.551
...they're either sort of insufficient or they're very, very expensive.

00:52.672 --> 00:55.338
And that struck me as being fiercely unfair...

00:55.409 --> 00:57.477
...and I thought I had a shot of doing something about it.
