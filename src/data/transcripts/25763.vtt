ï»¿When I go back to India, I feel at home.

00:10.623 --> 00:12.638
There's always a worry in the back of my head...

00:12.823 --> 00:15.573
...that this will be the last time I see my grandma.

00:16.799 --> 00:20.349
Every chance that I get, I want to cherish it.

00:22.351 --> 00:26.578
I was 12 when we moved, so I still have those memories of India.

00:26.999 --> 00:29.116
India is a beautiful chaos.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.903
In Canada, it's much more ordered.

00:34.516 --> 00:39.409
No matter how many years I've been away, home will always be India.
