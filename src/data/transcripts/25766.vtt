00:01.335 --> 00:03.822
ï»¿Everything that we do, we've learned.

00:04.879 --> 00:08.317
Not from a training manual or a technical school,...

00:10.679 --> 00:14.219
...but from the previous generation and the one before that.

00:16.305 --> 00:18.979
It wasn't taught but inherited.

00:20.855 --> 00:23.686
Never explained but always lived.

00:25.169 --> 00:29.273
A consideration for others that anticipates needs.

00:31.041 --> 00:36.636
Flavors that open your eyes and aromas that awaken your senses.

00:39.148 --> 00:42.505
Delicate beauty inherent in every detail.

00:45.907 --> 00:52.629
Virtues of welcome and hospitality born in every Thai.

00:53.702 --> 00:55.241
Welcoming the world.

00:55.557 --> 00:57.650
Yours to experience always.

00:57.991 --> 01:00.048
Thai: Smooth as silk.
