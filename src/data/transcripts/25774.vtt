The first thing we're gonna talk about is getting a board that's right for you.

00:04.013 --> 00:05.936
We want you to have a board that's great to learn on,...

00:06.175 --> 00:08.774
...but also good enough for you to surf well on when you improve.

00:09.448 --> 00:11.411
The best board for this is a "fish."

00:12.705 --> 00:17.343
Alrighty now, basically a "fish" is a mix between a longboard and a shortboard.

00:17.498 --> 00:20.745
These boards are a little bit thicker and thus more buoyant,...

00:20.835 --> 00:22.325
...meaning they make you float better.

00:22.539 --> 00:26.361
Now, the reason we're steering away from the shortboards for now...

00:26.494 --> 00:27.909
...is because they're a little bit thin,...

00:28.057 --> 00:30.417
...and it's gonna be hard to paddle and hard to catch waves.

00:30.625 --> 00:34.494
The reason we're staying away from the longboards is although they're easy to catch waves on,...

00:34.667 --> 00:37.359
...they're hard to paddle and negotiate the waves with.

00:37.518 --> 00:40.139
So, we got you something in the middle, the "fish."
