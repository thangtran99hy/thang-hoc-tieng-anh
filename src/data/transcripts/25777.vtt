00:00.985 --> 00:02.214
Alright, it's game time.

00:02.301 --> 00:03.845
We're ready to ride a motorcycle.

00:04.001 --> 00:05.743
I'm gonna start off just like I showed you.

00:05.966 --> 00:08.406
I'm gonna pull this clutch in, down into first gear,...

00:08.544 --> 00:11.675
...and now you're gonna notice me releasing the clutch and then coming on with the gas.

00:12.096 --> 00:13.234
Boom, we're under way.

00:13.421 --> 00:16.632
One of the things I want you to notice is how fast I picked up my foot over there.

00:16.892 --> 00:20.911
Sometimes rookies have this instinct to keep their feet down to help keep their balance.

00:21.032 --> 00:23.843
It can be dangerous if you have a foot come down while the bike's at speed.

00:23.937 --> 00:26.635
So, make a conscious effort to get your feet up as soon as it's practical.

00:26.937 --> 00:28.617
Now, I'm getting ready to come to a stop here.

00:28.702 --> 00:30.667
So, what I'm gonna do is the reverse of what we just did.

00:30.799 --> 00:34.357
Clutch in, throttle off, and brake smoothly to a stop.

00:34.650 --> 00:36.205
At this point, that's it.

00:36.438 --> 00:37.924
This is how you ride a motorcycle.
