So, there are few different types of logos.

00:02.398 --> 00:05.771
You can have an icon that's representative of the product or company name...

00:05.849 --> 00:07.441
...like Red Cross or Apple.

00:07.535 --> 00:10.872
Or you can have an icon that's purely symbolic and abstract...

00:11.031 --> 00:14.855
...like the Nike swoosh or the Twitter bird thingy.

00:14.979 --> 00:19.624
You can have a purely typographic logo which might just be written out in a typeface...

00:19.707 --> 00:21.427
...like Charity: Water or Google.

00:21.512 --> 00:26.277
Or the letter forms might become the unique logo itself like eBay or Subway.

00:26.423 --> 00:30.310
And then sometimes you'll have clever logos with hidden symbols or messages,...

00:30.447 --> 00:35.011
...like the arrow in FedEx or the arrow going from A to Z in Amazon.

00:35.129 --> 00:38.902
So, before you even think about starting to design your own logo,...

00:39.007 --> 00:41.919
...think about what really makes a logo successful.
