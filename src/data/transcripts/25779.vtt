My knowledge and experience from both past and present...

00:03.578 --> 00:05.757
...influence how I see the world around me.

00:05.972 --> 00:08.693
And therefore, I get inspired by observing things...

00:08.774 --> 00:12.075
...like a human-built environment or geometrical shapes.

00:13.215 --> 00:15.841
I also receive inspiration from the abstract world.

00:16.507 --> 00:19.915
From things like nature or even the concept of energy.

00:21.093 --> 00:25.832
And when I get inspired, ideas spontaneously arise from my imagination.

00:26.625 --> 00:29.998
Some of which I then have a desire to develop into paintings.

00:30.661 --> 00:32.517
So, I show up at my easel.

00:33.767 --> 00:39.406
A blank canvas is like an eager invitation for me to express and realize those ideas.

00:40.485 --> 00:42.063
To bring my expression to life,...

00:42.390 --> 00:47.460
...I use painting tools to give my hands and mind the opportunity to work together.

00:48.557 --> 00:49.911
For the paint medium itself,...

00:50.028 --> 00:54.187
...I love using a professional artist quality acrylic made right here in Canada.

00:55.121 --> 00:59.406
Masking tape is something I find totally fun and exciting to use as a tool.

01:00.163 --> 01:03.839
And even a regular hardware store paintbrush is one of my favorites.

01:04.835 --> 01:08.255
Using the simplest things is a rewarding creative experience.
