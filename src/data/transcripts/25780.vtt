I started playing guitar when I was, I think, about eight years old.

00:03.786 --> 00:05.809
I wasn't super dedicated to it for a long time.

00:05.920 --> 00:09.411
When I joined School of Rock like, it kinda made me wanna practice more...

00:09.505 --> 00:11.604
...and I got to start performing and that was a lot more fun...

00:11.695 --> 00:13.423
...than just sitting at home doing nothing.

00:13.671 --> 00:18.800
The first time I performed was at Toby Keith's Bar and Grill.

00:18.939 --> 00:20.043
I only got to play one song.

00:20.126 --> 00:24.433
I got to play "The Immigrant Song" by Led Zeppelin and, I mean, I probably sucked.

00:25.543 --> 00:28.215
I just had a lot of fun with it and enjoyed it a lot.

00:28.461 --> 00:31.154
I sometimes get nervous if I'm playing in front of a bigger crowd.

00:31.407 --> 00:34.526
But normally it doesn't stress me out too much anymore.

00:35.213 --> 00:37.019
And a lot of shows can be really exciting.
