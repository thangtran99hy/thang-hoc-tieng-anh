My dad is a musician, and so my dad bought me my first guitar for Christmas.

00:05.895 --> 00:09.915
He got me a Fender Strat. It was black.

00:10.232 --> 00:13.719
I was always a fan of female musicians that played guitars.

00:13.991 --> 00:16.098
I'm not very good at playing the guitar...

00:16.576 --> 00:20.114
...but I feel like the way that I play, I play well.

00:20.678 --> 00:31.192
I would say my guitar playing style is sloppy yet effective.

00:31.831 --> 00:32.611
Does that make sense?
