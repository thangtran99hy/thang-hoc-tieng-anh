Alright guys, so let's make these emoji and Minion eggs,...

00:03.085 --> 00:04.728
You will need some plastic eggs...

00:04.936 --> 00:09.199
...either spray paint or craft paint would do, a paint brush, some eyeballs...

00:09.348 --> 00:10.994
...and some Sharpie markers.

00:11.164 --> 00:13.185
Alright, so the first step is to paint the eggs...

00:13.271 --> 00:16.053
...and you can use spray paint or craft paint, whatever you like.

00:16.167 --> 00:19.146
Start with a primer and then paint on your main coat.

00:19.273 --> 00:22.549
For my little Minion guy, I'm painting on the pants with some blue craft paint.

00:22.651 --> 00:24.303
Then, let it set dry on a little cap.

00:24.707 --> 00:27.797
On the top part of your egg, draw a black line around.

00:28.145 --> 00:31.612
Now for the mouth, eyebrows, then glue on one or two eyeballs.

00:31.937 --> 00:34.195
For the emoji part, I just look at the picture for guidance...

00:34.283 --> 00:37.171
...and I use my Sharpie markers to draw in the face.

00:37.286 --> 00:41.497
After that I would use a red, white and blue paint to add in the details.
