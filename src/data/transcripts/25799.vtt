My name is Samantha Kallis, and I'm a visual development artist.

00:03.863 --> 00:08.340
A visual development artist will design anything from characters, props,...

00:08.484 --> 00:11.139
...textures, background paintings,...

00:11.418 --> 00:14.191
...pretty much anything that shows up on screen, somebody designed.

00:14.843 --> 00:16.505
Today, I chose the theme of adventure.

00:16.811 --> 00:21.881
I chose adventure because to me it's important to live your life adventurously...

00:21.965 --> 00:23.861
...but also be adventurous in your art.

00:24.273 --> 00:26.971
As an artist, if you're not adventurous and you don't take chances,...

00:27.069 --> 00:31.131
...then you end up just drawing the same, old, tired thing that you're comfortable with,...

00:31.233 --> 00:32.455
...then you never do anything new.

00:32.644 --> 00:33.551
You never grow.

00:33.914 --> 00:37.147
I guess the big adventure for me in the last couple of months...

00:37.253 --> 00:40.503
...has been getting to work at Sony and working at Nickelodeon...

00:40.593 --> 00:45.993
...and actually getting my hands dirty with animated television shows and features.

00:46.469 --> 00:49.299
Learning from professionals who I really admire,...

00:49.770 --> 00:51.290
...that's been the big adventure for me.
