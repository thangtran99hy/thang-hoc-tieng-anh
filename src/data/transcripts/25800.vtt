00:01.423 --> 00:02.411
That is my sister, Lily.

00:02.691 --> 00:04.702
She jumps around on YouTube for a living.

00:05.173 --> 00:07.040
Hearts and smarts!

00:07.747 --> 00:09.681
And that's my sister, Margot.

00:10.045 --> 00:12.835
She has a more sedentary lifestyle.

00:13.347 --> 00:16.677
By the way, I don't normally sit around watching videos of my sister working out.

00:17.420 --> 00:18.631
This is research for a bet.

00:19.221 --> 00:21.407
I dare you to start your own fitness channel.

00:21.795 --> 00:25.287
Okay, well, I would like to see you get more than zero friends.

00:25.533 --> 00:25.976
You're on.

00:30.439 --> 00:31.936
Let's do this, Vikings!

00:32.011 --> 00:32.738
Cruel world!

00:33.117 --> 00:34.105
How does dinner sound?

00:34.804 --> 00:35.037
Alright.

00:35.181 --> 00:37.199
Why would I ever watch you when I could just watch her?

00:38.477 --> 00:40.158
You wanna be my friend?

00:40.583 --> 00:41.979
This is completely impossible.

00:42.101 --> 00:43.253
I can talk fitness all day.

00:44.656 --> 00:46.025
Allie, can you help me up?

00:46.102 --> 00:47.411
I'm not on the grid.

00:47.551 --> 00:49.931
I have an idea that will totally reinvent book club.

00:50.001 --> 00:50.576
Please leave.

00:51.449 --> 00:54.273
Why can't running be more like walking or napping?

00:54.683 --> 00:55.809
I think I might be jacked!
