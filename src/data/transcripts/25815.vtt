00:01.775 --> 00:13.720
O say can you see by the dawn's early light...

00:14.731 --> 00:27.644
...what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?

00:28.642 --> 00:41.137
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight...

00:41.761 --> 00:56.307
...o'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?

00:58.025 --> 01:10.227
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,...

01:10.429 --> 01:25.449
...gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.

01:25.829 --> 01:41.367
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave...

01:46.095 --> 02:08.517
...o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
