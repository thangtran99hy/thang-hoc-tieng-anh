ï»¿And as the first woman to win Album of the Year at the Grammys twice,...

00:09.319 --> 00:12.451
I want to say to all the young women out there,...

00:13.998 --> 00:15.734
...there are going to be people along the way...

00:15.927 --> 00:19.226
...who will try to undercut your success...

00:20.041 --> 00:24.595
...or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.756
But if you just focus on the work...

00:28.978 --> 00:31.229
...and you don't let those people sidetrack you,...

00:31.524 --> 00:33.367
...someday when you get where you're going...

00:33.875 --> 00:36.781
...you'll look around and you will know that it was you...

00:37.029 --> 00:39.605
...and the people who love you who put you there.

00:39.974 --> 00:42.361
And that would be the greatest feeling in the world.

00:43.246 --> 00:45.003
Thank you for this moment.
