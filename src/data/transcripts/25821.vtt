00:00.681 --> 00:06.301
I am the grandson of immigrants from Japan who went to America.

00:07.069 --> 00:15.001
I was four years old when Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7th, 1941 by Japan.

00:15.508 --> 00:20.541
And overnight, the world was plunged into a world war.

00:22.637 --> 00:26.792
My brother and I were in the living room looking out the front window,...

00:27.450 --> 00:30.590
...and we saw two soldiers marching up our driveway.

00:31.237 --> 00:34.425
They carried bayonets on their rifle.

00:34.809 --> 00:38.765
They stomped up the front porch and banged on the door.

00:39.460 --> 00:44.854
My father answered it, and the soldiers ordered us out of our home.

00:45.723 --> 00:47.081
We were taken from our home...

00:47.731 --> 00:52.569
...and loaded on to train cars with other Japanese-American families.

00:52.889 --> 00:58.356
There were guards stationed at both ends of each car as if we were criminals.

00:58.919 --> 01:05.249
We were taken on that train for four days and three nights to the swamps of Arkansas.

01:05.624 --> 01:09.297
I still remember the barbed wire fence that confined me.

01:10.389 --> 01:15.659
I remember the tall sentry tower with the machine guns pointed at us.

01:16.299 --> 01:20.527
I remember the searchlight that followed me when I made the night runs...

01:20.624 --> 01:22.480
...from my barrack to the latrine.

01:23.342 --> 01:26.059
When the war ended, we were released...

01:26.618 --> 01:30.812
...and given a one-way ticket to anywhere in the United States.
