00:02.793 --> 00:06.537
In a moment like that one, I find myself afterwards thinking,...

00:06.627 --> 00:07.814
..."I should've said something."

00:08.995 --> 00:11.323
When I was younger, when I was only 14,...

00:12.162 --> 00:15.793
...I was told by a drama teacher that I might do okay...

00:15.978 --> 00:18.314
...if I was happy to settle for the fat girl parts.

00:19.874 --> 00:20.879
Look at me now.

00:22.159 --> 00:22.832
Look at me now.

00:23.307 --> 00:27.545
And so, what I feel like saying in those moments is any young woman...

00:27.908 --> 00:32.899
...who has ever been put down by a teacher or a friend or even a parent,...

00:33.277 --> 00:36.943
...just don't listen to any of it because that's what I did.

00:37.047 --> 00:41.789
I didn't listen and I kept on going and I overcame all of my fears...

00:41.854 --> 00:43.593
...and I got over a lot of insecurity.

00:44.063 --> 00:47.182
And just keep doing it and keep believing in yourself.

00:47.627 --> 00:50.807
That's what I felt like I really had to dig deep and do.

00:52.080 --> 00:55.789
And so, I would dedicate it to all those young women who doubt themselves...

00:56.060 --> 00:57.216
...because you shouldn't be doubting.

00:57.633 --> 00:59.465
You should just be going for it.
