We're here in central Hokkaido, thanks to Odigo,...

00:03.571 --> 00:07.350
...visiting an ice village supposedly built out on a frozen lake in the mountains.

00:09.455 --> 00:10.697
This whole place is free.

00:11.469 --> 00:17.108
They just spend their time building all this stuff and they don't get much, I guess.

00:18.445 --> 00:19.241
So, yeah.

00:19.411 --> 00:20.005
Yeah!

00:20.721 --> 00:21.575
It's nice to donate.

00:21.678 --> 00:22.949
They did a really good job here.

00:26.936 --> 00:29.017
This building is made entirely of ice...

00:29.347 --> 00:32.361
...and includes a cafe, a small second floor for seating,...

00:32.755 --> 00:34.587
...and a stage for performances!

00:35.089 --> 00:39.255
You can even get drinks in glasses made of ice, which was really cool to drink out of.

00:39.859 --> 00:41.459
They let you take the glass home as well,...

00:41.640 --> 00:43.904
...but good luck getting it back to your fridge!

00:44.985 --> 00:47.199
So, this place was super cool.

00:48.103 --> 00:50.354
This ice cafe is definitely the coolest part.

00:50.507 --> 00:53.243
I'm impressed that they could make something this big out of ice.

00:53.341 --> 00:55.515
But anyway, it is cold!

00:55.733 --> 00:58.249
Remember this is all ice and snow.
