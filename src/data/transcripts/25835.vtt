Japanese start-up Vinclu Inc. released a video this week...

00:03.537 --> 00:06.107
...showing off their hologram assistant.

00:06.424 --> 00:07.471
It's called Gatebox...

00:07.543 --> 00:10.610
...and it's designed to be similar in function to other virtual assistants...

00:10.715 --> 00:12.685
...like Alexa, Siri and Cortana.

00:12.854 --> 00:15.873
The name of Gatebox's digital assistant is Azuma Hikari...

00:15.971 --> 00:19.597
...and she will wake you up in the morning, wish you farewell when you leave...

00:20.151 --> 00:22.147
...and greet you when you arrive home at the end of the day.

00:22.710 --> 00:24.107
It also works with the Internet of Things...

00:24.287 --> 00:27.031
...so Azuma can connect to compatible devices in your house...

00:27.208 --> 00:29.810
...and give you information like the weather on demand.
