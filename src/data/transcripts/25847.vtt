00:00.409 --> 00:04.455
When you go to space, you look back at the planet from that orbital vantage point,...

00:04.929 --> 00:07.126
...the Earth is this little blue marble.

00:08.114 --> 00:12.359
The perspective that you get from that vantage point cognitively changes you.

00:16.701 --> 00:19.389
I think the thing that changes your thinking in space...

00:19.470 --> 00:23.886
...is that you're doing something that only a very small number of people have done.

00:24.760 --> 00:26.815
In the history of human space flight,...

00:26.901 --> 00:30.890
...there's only been like 500 people that have had this opportunity to go off the planet.

00:31.194 --> 00:32.396
And now, you're one of them.

00:32.917 --> 00:35.517
You get much calmer when you come back from space...

00:35.610 --> 00:40.451
...because the things that you thought were a big deal are no longer a big deal.

00:40.571 --> 00:42.368
These things that are happening day-to-day...

00:42.461 --> 00:46.053
...like a hangnail or tripping or someone cutting you off in traffic,...

00:46.201 --> 00:49.394
...it pales in comparison to the experience that you have had.

00:51.037 --> 00:56.961
Space transformed me to think about how do we get that next generation...

00:57.101 --> 01:02.115
...to take my seat and go off somewhere else and do much better things.
