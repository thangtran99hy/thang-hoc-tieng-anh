I don't know why they make these barrettes so complicated for guys.

My dad's giving me a Dad-do.

00:06.715 --> 00:08.173
A Dad-do comes from the heart.

00:08.665 --> 00:09.914
It's probably not a whole lot of style.

00:12.571 --> 00:15.803
Who knows, I mean, maybe there's a postcareer here.

00:16.721 --> 00:17.930
What are you giggling about?

00:18.861 --> 00:20.006
I love you, Dad.

00:22.647 --> 00:23.927
When you look in the mirror, who do you see?

00:24.791 --> 00:25.167
Me.

00:25.849 --> 00:27.221
That strong is beautiful.
