00:00.243 --> 00:04.224
A hundred years ago, that would have been the magic of levitation.

00:04.851 --> 00:07.089
Is it possible to create illusions in a world...

00:07.166 --> 00:10.941
...where technology makes anything possible?

00:11.412 --> 00:11.801
Stay!

00:12.651 --> 00:15.578
If you know how the trick is done, where is the illusion?

00:16.075 --> 00:16.650
Here, boy!

00:20.459 --> 00:21.737
He can do a trick.

00:22.026 --> 00:22.465
Watch.

00:24.253 --> 00:25.009
Up!

00:31.284 --> 00:32.394
Hey, where are you going?

00:33.701 --> 00:36.217
I think there's more to this than meets the eye.

00:40.817 --> 00:41.664
Come back!

00:44.138 --> 00:45.080
Very funny!

00:46.635 --> 00:47.975
Behave yourselves!

00:49.897 --> 00:51.866
As a magician, I have always known...

00:51.965 --> 00:54.398
...that the illusion is in the mind of the beholder.

00:55.183 --> 00:58.703
Once upon a time, this would have been magic.

00:59.479 --> 01:02.627
Today, it is a trick of technology.

01:03.267 --> 01:07.777
But still, our imagination is more powerful than our reasoning.

01:08.613 --> 01:12.887
And it's easy to attribute personality to machines.
