The Studio Wrap really is a game changer for us.

00:07.879 --> 00:10.109
It's a new way to look at footwear.

00:10.561 --> 00:13.053
We went after two performance needs for the shoe.

00:13.199 --> 00:17.007
One was solve the hygiene problem and the other was to give her traction.

00:17.882 --> 00:19.505
The foot is the most important part.

00:19.702 --> 00:21.309
The foot is what's engaged in the ground...

00:21.421 --> 00:24.665
...and it's what starts the whole kinetic chain reaction when she's training.

00:26.184 --> 00:29.876
The first inspiration really came from taking a barre class.

00:30.065 --> 00:33.583
Barre is based around the idea of yoga, Pilates...

00:33.740 --> 00:36.369
...and with a little bit of ballet influence mixed in.

00:36.752 --> 00:41.117
I bought a load of all kinds of stretchy material and started wrapping my feet.

00:41.194 --> 00:44.129
I'm playing with different shapes about what felt good on the foot...

00:44.251 --> 00:45.887
...when you moved in different positions.

00:46.089 --> 00:47.916
We're gonna make her foot look beautiful,...

00:48.000 --> 00:50.486
...give her every performance need that she could ever want...

00:50.583 --> 00:54.459
...but not take away that Zen feeling that barefoot experience can give her.

00:54.615 --> 00:57.141
I wanted her to have a product that not only worked for her...

00:57.267 --> 00:59.599
...but she wanted to come on a workout that she felt great...

00:59.671 --> 01:00.715
...like she started her day.
