ï»¿Every now and then, you come across a project that's really memorable...

00:07.005 --> 00:08.059
...or really inspirational.

00:08.493 --> 00:10.665
One that stands out for me is by Katherine Newman.

00:13.520 --> 00:16.308
The space is so creative, daring and so playful.

00:16.627 --> 00:20.021
It has exuberant color, clever architecture, bold finishes...

00:20.278 --> 00:22.243
...and artfully layered patterns and textures.

00:22.516 --> 00:24.291
Katherine really went all out here.

00:26.103 --> 00:29.191
She worked with architect Peter Cebulak to design a family home...

00:29.282 --> 00:31.632
...that has spacious rooms and plenty of natural light.

00:32.027 --> 00:34.500
It's a fun place for the homeowners and their three children...

00:34.602 --> 00:35.758
...and it's great for entertaining.
