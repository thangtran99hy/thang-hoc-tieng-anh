A calendar year is made of 365 days. It's supposed to match the solar year.

00:05.586 --> 00:07.016
But things aren't quite that simple.

00:07.309 --> 00:13.005
It actually takes Earth 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds to complete its orbit.

00:13.209 --> 00:14.876
Those extra hours gradually add up...

00:14.953 --> 00:18.349
...so that after four years, the calendar is out of step by about one day.

00:18.522 --> 00:21.108
Every four years, an extra day is added to the calendar,...

00:21.227 --> 00:23.822
...making the length of the year 366 days.

00:23.946 --> 00:24.699
Easy, right?

00:24.974 --> 00:27.925
The Egyptians were the first people to think of adding a leap day...

00:28.008 --> 00:29.559
...to the calendar every four years.

00:30.059 --> 00:31.829
Later, the Romans copied the idea.
