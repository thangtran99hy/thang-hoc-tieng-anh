Today, we're not just launching our new phone,...

00:11.896 --> 00:15.146
...we're launching a new way of thinking about what a phone can do.

00:15.876 --> 00:19.239
A phone that makes you rethink the phone.

00:19.857 --> 00:24.130
Introducing Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge.

00:26.067 --> 00:27.949
We spend more time with our phones than ever.

00:28.045 --> 00:30.612
And yet, they're not designed to be held comfortably.

00:31.919 --> 00:35.282
But now, with the elegant back curve of the S7,...

00:35.469 --> 00:38.491
...and the streamlined front and back of the S7 Edge,...

00:38.830 --> 00:41.739
...both nestle perfectly into the palm of your hand.

00:43.200 --> 00:46.325
Our phones go everywhere with us except in water.

00:46.442 --> 00:47.815
Well, until now.

00:47.997 --> 00:50.337
Even in the rain, the shower, or the pool.

00:50.575 --> 00:52.631
Open up a new world to use it in.

00:59.114 --> 01:03.548
The S7 has a phone camera that uses the technology found in professional cameras.

01:04.615 --> 01:07.182
100% of the pixels are used to focus.

01:07.447 --> 01:10.269
And every single one works just like our two eyes,...

01:10.737 --> 01:13.645
...which means you have autofocus in a split second.

01:18.133 --> 01:21.383
And you can shoot in the dark and own the night, ...

01:21.996 --> 01:25.303
...because some of our most precious memories happen in the dark.

01:27.182 --> 01:30.716
You define the possibilities and we'll redefine the phone.

01:31.299 --> 01:34.377
Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge.

01:35.487 --> 01:37.315
Rethink what a phone can do.
