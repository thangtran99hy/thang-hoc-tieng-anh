ï»¿Serena Williams.

00:01.911 --> 00:02.559
Hey, Watson.

00:02.815 --> 00:04.279
You are a fierce competitor.

00:04.429 --> 00:05.124
I've heard that.

00:05.387 --> 00:07.534
I have analyzed your biggest matches.

00:07.669 --> 00:08.276
Oh, really?

00:08.662 --> 00:13.299
When down a point, you serve an ace 5.8 times more than other top players.

00:13.411 --> 00:14.663
You sound like a coach.

00:14.807 --> 00:19.377
I am not but I can customize training programs based on biomarker data.

00:19.544 --> 00:21.135
Watson, that's pretty impressive.

00:21.264 --> 00:25.242
You might say, "I am the Serena Williams of cloud-based cognitive systems."

00:25.849 --> 00:27.372
Nah, I wouldn't go that far.
