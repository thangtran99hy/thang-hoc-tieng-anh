We use this every day as a stand-in for love and the human heart.

00:04.187 --> 00:06.371
But it doesn't really look like the real thing.

00:08.479 --> 00:11.922
Zachary Crockett at Priceonomics has looked into the history of this.

00:12.653 --> 00:16.475
He says that there are relics resembling the heart shape from 3000 BC.

00:16.573 --> 00:19.990
But these shapes stood for ivy or fig leaves, not the heart.

00:20.817 --> 00:22.776
It wasn't until several centuries later...

00:22.841 --> 00:25.149
...that the heart became a symbol representing love.

00:25.587 --> 00:28.342
But the problem was they didn't really know what the heart looked like,...

00:28.802 --> 00:31.665
...partially because of the Catholic Church prohibited autopsies.

00:32.083 --> 00:34.793
So, when artists try to draw the heart as a symbol of love,...

00:34.952 --> 00:38.406
...like in this French manuscript from 1250, it looked like this.

00:39.267 --> 00:41.567
By the time detailed anatomical drawings appeared,...

00:41.660 --> 00:44.925
...like those of Leonardo da Vinci in the early 16th century,...

00:45.362 --> 00:47.424
...the simplified symbol had already taken root.

00:48.103 --> 00:50.615
It became a popular image in Catholic symbolism,...

00:50.700 --> 00:53.253
...as well as secular things like decks of cards.

00:54.261 --> 00:58.580
Eventually, New York City's 1977 campaign turned the heart symbol into a verb.

00:59.892 --> 01:01.099
I love New York.

01:01.243 --> 01:02.447
Replacing the word "love."
