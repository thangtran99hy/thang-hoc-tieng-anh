When you get a phone number from someone,...

00:04.848 --> 00:07.355
...do you think you should be texting them or should you be calling them?

00:08.807 --> 00:09.904
Calling them.

00:10.026 --> 00:10.291
Why?

00:11.071 --> 00:13.865
Because they gave you your phone number.

00:14.827 --> 00:22.675
I think call because if you text, you don't know if she says "bye",...

00:22.756 --> 00:25.524
...if she says it in a nice way or a mean way.

00:26.112 --> 00:27.863
Best thing to do is text message.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.652
Make sure to text them first.

00:32.269 --> 00:32.679
Why?

00:34.075 --> 00:36.881
If you call them and you don't know what to say really...

00:37.985 --> 00:41.399
I would say either in person or text...

00:41.579 --> 00:43.842
...because call is just weird.

00:44.001 --> 00:44.388
Why?

00:45.285 --> 00:46.893
I don't know, it just doesn't feel right.

00:46.973 --> 00:47.821
You call him and it's like,

00:48.096 --> 00:49.279
"Hey, wanna go on a date?"

00:50.221 --> 00:51.656
They're gonna be like, "What?"
