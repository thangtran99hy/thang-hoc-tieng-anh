00:03.107 --> 00:04.877
So, I have to call a biologist.

00:05.220 --> 00:08.598
I'm Anthony Russel from the Department of Biological Sciences...

00:08.666 --> 00:11.457
...of University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada.

00:11.765 --> 00:14.321
We're talking about a species of flying lizards.

00:14.490 --> 00:18.565
So, it's called Draco volans, which means "flying dragon."

00:18.836 --> 00:23.708
Okay, these flying dragons, they are a little different from the dragons we see in movies.

00:24.281 --> 00:26.023
For starters, they're small.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.402
They are, they are.

00:27.611 --> 00:31.429
Only about eight inches long and they don't breathe fire.

00:31.735 --> 00:34.929
But they do fly, in a way.

00:36.048 --> 00:40.863
They're gliders, which means they have control of their descent and trajectory,...

00:41.131 --> 00:42.765
...but they don't have any power in it.

00:43.145 --> 00:45.314
That's because they don't actually have wings.

00:45.762 --> 00:50.207
They're actually modifications of the ribs so they have nothing to do with the legs and arms.

00:50.639 --> 00:54.302
Evolutionarily speaking, this has helped the lizards survive.

00:54.565 --> 00:58.441
They can escape attacks and they have a broader living zone.

00:58.841 --> 01:01.164
So, they might not be "dragon" dragons.

01:01.383 --> 01:05.400
Sometimes people name things because it's more dramatic effect.

01:05.571 --> 01:07.341
Well, they're still incredible lizards.
