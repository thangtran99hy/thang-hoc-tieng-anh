Cotton candy.

00:02.304 --> 00:05.188
Who knew sugar and air could taste so sweet?

00:05.745 --> 00:07.572
Well, a guy named James Morrison,...

00:08.039 --> 00:13.393
...an amateur inventor whose occupation and taste buds didn't exactly align.

00:15.902 --> 00:17.482
He was a dentist.

00:17.689 --> 00:19.050
And during his lifetime,...

00:19.267 --> 00:23.761
...James even became the president of the Tennessee Dental Association.

00:23.897 --> 00:25.219
Don't forget to floss!

00:25.335 --> 00:30.172
But he was also a confectionery enthusiast with a passion for culinary advancement.

00:30.259 --> 00:34.233
He paired with John C. Wharton, an old friend and fellow confectioner.

00:34.545 --> 00:39.843
Together, the two designed and copatented what they called the "electronic candy machine."

00:40.041 --> 00:43.653
The device rapidly spun and melted sugar through small holes...

00:43.771 --> 00:46.367
...until it was fluffy and nearly 70 percent air.

00:46.598 --> 00:48.823
They called the new treat "fairy floss."

00:49.147 --> 00:51.377
Fairy floss was a huge success.

00:51.631 --> 00:54.967
In six months, they sold over 68,000 boxes,...

00:55.315 --> 00:59.873
...grossing in today's money around 440,000 dollars.

01:00.348 --> 01:03.484
But despite the success of their sugar-spun business,...

01:03.821 --> 01:07.641
...Morrison returned to his day job as a dentist.

01:07.871 --> 01:11.526
So, next time the dentist tells you you're eating too many sugary treats,...

01:11.851 --> 01:13.851
...well, blame him.
