Feminism is being strong, powerful and confident in who you are.

00:05.408 --> 00:09.579
I define feminism as a woman's right to choose, a woman's right to be free,...

00:09.781 --> 00:12.022
...to be equal to her counterpart.

00:12.120 --> 00:15.377
Change for the better for women would be more opportunities.

00:15.586 --> 00:17.851
I think there could be more equality in workforces.

00:17.974 --> 00:21.892
I think women should encourage other women not see as competition.

00:22.173 --> 00:23.142
They can be mothers.

00:23.303 --> 00:24.746
They can be businesswomen.

00:24.963 --> 00:26.031
They can be students.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.103
They can be dancers.

00:27.251 --> 00:29.109
They can be anything they set their minds to.

00:29.299 --> 00:32.513
A woman is a strong human being that is capable of anything.

00:32.689 --> 00:33.075
Anything.

00:33.153 --> 00:33.721
Anything they want.

00:33.845 --> 00:34.968
Women are capable of anything.

00:35.147 --> 00:36.810
Women are capable of everything.

00:36.896 --> 00:38.489
We could do anything.

00:38.599 --> 00:39.410
Girl power.

00:39.565 --> 00:40.549
We run the world.
