ï»¿You seem depressed.

00:03.232 --> 00:05.669
So, I guess you can analyze tones too.

00:06.143 --> 00:06.758
Like Watson.

00:06.871 --> 00:07.133
No.

00:07.268 --> 00:08.646
It's just pretty obvious.

00:08.857 --> 00:10.521
Obvious I have no purpose anymore.

00:10.869 --> 00:12.165
I didn't say that.

00:12.655 --> 00:13.498
You didn't have to.

00:13.609 --> 00:15.116
It's written all over your face.

00:15.525 --> 00:17.001
How about a hug?

00:17.545 --> 00:18.538
This may shock you.

00:18.945 --> 00:19.480
What?

00:20.160 --> 00:20.803
Ah, no!

00:21.189 --> 00:23.615
Literally, my wires may shock you. Like, don't.
