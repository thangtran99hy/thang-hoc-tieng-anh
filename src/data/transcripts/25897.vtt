Naples, technically an independent kingdom in the 1700s and early 1800s,...

00:06.132 --> 00:09.312
...was filled with working poor or "lazzaroni."

00:10.303 --> 00:11.570
Unlike the wealthy minority,...

00:11.818 --> 00:15.110
...these working class Neapolitans needed cheap and quick food.

00:16.368 --> 00:17.574
Pizza met this need.

00:18.761 --> 00:20.792
Whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner,...

00:21.121 --> 00:24.129
...pizza was sold by street vendors at informal restaurants...

00:24.747 --> 00:27.327
...and featured the toppings that are still popular today...

00:27.619 --> 00:30.783
...like tomatoes, cheese, anchovies, oil and garlic.

00:31.649 --> 00:33.663
Despite a stamp of approval from the crown,...

00:34.023 --> 00:36.706
...pizza remained little-known in Italy beyond the border of Naples...

00:36.793 --> 00:37.961
...until the 1940s.

00:38.759 --> 00:40.022
An ocean away however,...

00:40.598 --> 00:43.871
...Neapolitan immigrants were already replicating and popularizing pizza.

00:44.837 --> 00:48.488
And the United States already had its first licensed pizzeria by 1905.

00:50.081 --> 00:52.825
From there, pizza has slowly taken over the world,...

00:53.191 --> 00:56.291
...become one of the most popular and well-known foods today.
