A lot of people think that innovation is just having a great idea.

00:06.730 --> 00:09.669
But a lot of it is just moving quickly and trying a lot of things.

00:09.761 --> 00:14.032
So at Facebook, we've really built our whole company and our culture around this.

00:14.181 --> 00:17.545
We do things like ship code every single day.

00:17.759 --> 00:21.421
And we have this tradition of having hackathons,...

00:21.518 --> 00:25.672
...which are events where all of our engineers and really the whole company get together...

00:25.766 --> 00:27.789
...and stay up all night just building things,...

00:27.874 --> 00:30.161
...whatever they want, not what they're doing for work.

00:30.249 --> 00:31.950
Just trying things out and innovating.
