Having tattoos lowers your chances of finding a job...

00:03.177 --> 00:05.061
...and also makes people think you're a drunk.

00:05.221 --> 00:07.459
Those two things, probably related.

00:13.021 --> 00:14.125
Anthony here for DNews.

In a study run by the University of St Andrews in Scotland...

00:17.795 --> 00:22.857
...showed that employers across just about all industries have a negative view of tattoos.

00:22.948 --> 00:26.198
They used words like "dirty", "repugnant" and "abhorrent"...

00:26.289 --> 00:29.059
...when describing how they thought their clients or customers...

00:29.135 --> 00:31.359
...would perceive tattooed people as employees.

00:31.431 --> 00:36.445
Well, 30% of them think that somebody with a tattoo is more likely to do something deviant.

00:36.654 --> 00:41.566
A quarter of them think the tattooed population is less intelligent and less healthy overall.

00:41.817 --> 00:46.642
The health response seems to be a mix of the perceived lifestyle of somebody with body art...

00:46.812 --> 00:50.859
...and misconceptions about the actual cleanliness of the tattooing process.
