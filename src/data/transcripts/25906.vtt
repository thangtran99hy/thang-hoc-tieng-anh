00:01.765 --> 00:02.733
Here's what we were thinking.

00:03.566 --> 00:06.949
What if we did for mortgages what the Internet did for buying music...

00:07.126 --> 00:08.945
...and plane tickets and shoes?

00:09.403 --> 00:11.967
You would turn an intimidating process into an easy one.

00:12.698 --> 00:15.101
You could get a mortgage on your phone.

00:15.842 --> 00:16.939
And if it could be that easy,...

00:17.404 --> 00:18.828
...wouldn't more people buy homes?

00:19.561 --> 00:21.225
And wouldn't those buyers need to fill their homes...

00:21.297 --> 00:25.379
...with lamps and blenders and sectional couches with hand-lathed wooden legs?

00:25.882 --> 00:28.633
And wouldn't that mean all sorts of wooden leg making opportunities...

00:28.721 --> 00:29.902
...for wooden leg makers?

00:30.747 --> 00:32.471
And wouldn't those new leg makers own phones...

00:32.573 --> 00:35.405
...from which they could quickly and easily secure mortgages of their own,...

00:35.999 --> 00:38.399
...further stoking demand for necessary household goods?

00:38.495 --> 00:41.607
Thus, our tidal wave of ownership floods the country with new homeowners...

00:41.721 --> 00:43.119
...who now must own other things.

00:44.429 --> 00:46.433
And isn't that the power of America itself?

00:47.232 --> 00:49.287
Now shrunk to fit the hands of a child...

00:49.744 --> 00:52.097
...or more helpfully, a home buying adult.

00:52.830 --> 00:54.429
Anyway, that's what we were thinking.

00:59.295 --> 00:59.978
Rocket.
