With climbing, I don't think that it really matters how big you are.

00:10.887 --> 00:13.253
If you're smaller, you can hold on longer...

00:13.643 --> 00:17.493
...and your hands might be smaller so you can fit more fingers on holds.

00:22.853 --> 00:27.572
I started climbing in Central Park when I was six years old.

00:27.893 --> 00:29.887
Now I don't think I can live without it.

00:37.453 --> 00:41.855
When you're close to the top of the climb you're trying to do,...

00:41.983 --> 00:45.085
...your forearms usually feel like they're gonna explode...

00:45.158 --> 00:49.442
...and they're gonna burst open and you feel like you have to let go.

00:49.779 --> 00:52.145
But with climbing, you just can't let go.

00:53.302 --> 00:57.029
I think that climbing is obviously a sport.

00:57.242 --> 00:59.235
It's also like, advanced.

00:59.796 --> 01:03.188
You sort of have to be able to like, flow up the wall...

01:03.326 --> 01:06.248
...and come up with your own technique to get to the top.
