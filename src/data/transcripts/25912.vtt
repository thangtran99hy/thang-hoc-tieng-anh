00:02.733 --> 00:05.325
Go is a very ancient game.

00:06.020 --> 00:08.083
It's probably the most complex game humans play.

00:08.294 --> 00:11.959
There's more configurations of the board than there are atoms in the universe.

00:12.746 --> 00:15.160
So, we've beaten Fan Hui, the European champion.

00:15.351 --> 00:19.079
Now, we have to go and demonstrate we can beat the world's top players,...

00:19.310 --> 00:21.055
...not just the European top player.

00:22.024 --> 00:25.589
So, we're actually going to be playing a match in March against Lee Sedol,...

00:25.780 --> 00:27.685
...who is the greatest player of modern times.

00:27.757 --> 00:30.431
He has won more championships than any other player in the last decade.

00:30.801 --> 00:34.157
And he has accepted the challenge to play AlphaGo...

00:34.522 --> 00:39.600
...and we're quietly confident that again, who knows what will happen.

00:39.883 --> 00:43.115
A human perhaps can play a thousand games a year.

00:43.437 --> 00:48.093
AlphaGo can play through millions of games every single day.

00:48.931 --> 00:53.992
That's at least conceivable that as a result, AlphaGo could, given enough processing,...

00:54.079 --> 00:58.735
...given enough training, given enough search power, reach a level that's beyond any human.
