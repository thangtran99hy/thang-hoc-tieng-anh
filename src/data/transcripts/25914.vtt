My name is Morgan Freeman.

00:01.683 --> 00:05.408
I'm going to do a dramatic reading from a very popular songwriter.

00:08.355 --> 00:11.257
For all the times that you rain on my parade,...

00:11.639 --> 00:14.379
...and all the clubs you get in using my name.

00:15.172 --> 00:16.431
You think you broke my heart?

00:16.683 --> 00:18.214
Oh girl, for goodness' sake.

00:18.746 --> 00:20.854
You think I'm crying on my own?

00:22.079 --> 00:22.988
Well, I ain't.

00:23.884 --> 00:28.312
And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care.

00:29.405 --> 00:29.917
I don't.

00:30.679 --> 00:32.099
But, you still hit my phone up.

00:32.313 --> 00:34.572
And baby I'm moving on.

00:35.119 --> 00:38.270
And I think you should be something I don't wanna hold back.

00:39.359 --> 00:40.647
Maybe you should know that.

00:42.417 --> 00:47.420
My mama didn't like you and she likes everyone.

00:47.925 --> 00:51.398
And I never liked to admit that I was wrong.

00:52.641 --> 00:54.688
And I've been so caught up in my job,...

00:55.021 --> 00:56.483
...didn't see what was going on.

00:56.885 --> 00:57.613
But now, I know.

00:58.821 --> 01:00.709
I'm better sleeping on my own.

01:02.110 --> 01:04.435
'Cause if you like the way you look that much,...

01:04.749 --> 01:08.542
...oh baby, you should go and love yourself.

01:10.149 --> 01:12.843
And if you think that I'm still holding on to something,...

01:15.056 --> 01:16.477
...you should go and love yourself.
