Hey guys, I'm Raymond Wong, product analyst with Mashable,...

00:07.723 --> 00:10.382
...and today we're gonna check out the Samsung Gear 360,...

00:10.715 --> 00:14.533
...a new 360-degree camera that lets you capture your own VR content.

00:18.561 --> 00:20.521
Samsung's already got the Gear VR headset...

00:20.939 --> 00:23.148
...and now it's got a VR camera to go along with it.

00:23.553 --> 00:27.837
The Gear 360 is a tiny ball-shaped camera that fits in the palm of your hand.

00:28.344 --> 00:30.562
The splashproof camera has two fish-eye lenses...

00:30.919 --> 00:34.124
...that each capture video in 195 degrees.

00:34.648 --> 00:38.112
The videos are then stitched together into a 360-degree video...

00:38.337 --> 00:40.158
...using the power of the Galaxy S7.

00:40.823 --> 00:43.690
360-degree videos are saved to a micro SD card...

00:44.055 --> 00:47.078
...and can be wirelessly transferred to a Galaxy S7 smartphone...

00:47.211 --> 00:50.221
...for editing and sharing to Facebook, YouTube, etc.

00:50.919 --> 00:54.325
Final videos have a resolution of 3840 x 1920,...

00:54.761 --> 00:56.173
...and in my opinion, look quite good.
