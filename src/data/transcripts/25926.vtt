00:01.807 --> 00:05.007
I am not black.

00:05.808 --> 00:11.269
I mean, that's what the world calls me but it's not me.

00:11.933 --> 00:14.451
I didn't come out of my mother's womb saying,...

00:14.771 --> 00:17.198
"Hey everybody, I'm black."

00:17.869 --> 00:20.173
No, I was taught to be black.

00:20.628 --> 00:22.464
And you were taught to call me that,...

00:22.981 --> 00:25.346
...along with whatever you call yourself.

00:25.743 --> 00:27.637
It's just a label.

00:28.811 --> 00:31.830
Who would you be if the world never gave you a label?

00:32.920 --> 00:35.037
Never gave you a box to check?

00:35.611 --> 00:38.163
Would you be White? Black? Mexican?

00:38.263 --> 00:40.947
Asian? Native American? Middle Eastern? Indian?

00:41.064 --> 00:43.119
No. We would be one.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.579
We would be together.
