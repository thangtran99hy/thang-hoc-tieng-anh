So many things go wrong when you're starting a company,...

00:02.769 --> 00:07.103
...and often, I think people ask what mistakes should you avoid making.

00:07.390 --> 00:11.453
And my answer to that question is don't even bother trying to avoid mistakes...

00:11.536 --> 00:13.247
...because you're gonna make tons of mistakes, right?

00:13.331 --> 00:18.271
And the important thing is actually learning quickly from whatever mistakes you make...

00:18.457 --> 00:19.257
...and not giving up.

00:20.991 --> 00:24.484
There are things every single year of Facebook's existence that could have killed us,...

00:24.583 --> 00:26.923
...or made it so that it just seemed like moving forward...

00:26.988 --> 00:29.126
...and making a lot of progress it just seemed intractable,...

00:29.376 --> 00:31.327
...but you just bounce back and you learn.

00:31.397 --> 00:33.273
And nothing is impossible.

00:33.377 --> 00:36.609
You just have to keep running through the walls.
