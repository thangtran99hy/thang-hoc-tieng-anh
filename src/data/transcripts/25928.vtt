Commuting to and from work is an American pastime.

00:03.378 --> 00:05.162
For some, it's a long drive through traffic...

00:05.261 --> 00:07.441
...or a series of walks and subway stops.

00:07.817 --> 00:11.048
But a very lucky few will ride to work this morning on a mountain bike.

00:11.902 --> 00:14.347
Mountain bikes are designed to travel through the rugged terrain...

00:14.411 --> 00:15.835
...found on mountain bike trails,...

00:16.067 --> 00:17.967
...so by definition, they are quite durable.

00:18.685 --> 00:21.855
Potholes, curbs, and alternate routes are no problem.

00:22.527 --> 00:26.502
Strangely enough, the mountain bike might be the ultimate urban commuter vehicle.

00:26.898 --> 00:28.149
They're ready for everything.

00:28.859 --> 00:31.657
When you commute on a mountain bike, there's no such thing as traffic.

00:32.224 --> 00:34.881
Come to think of it, you can circumvent roads altogether.
