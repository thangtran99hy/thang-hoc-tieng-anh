00:01.283 --> 00:03.693
To make our zero gravity video for "Upside Down and Inside Out,"...

00:03.774 --> 00:05.921
...we flew in a plane that basically goes like this.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.292
Each of these humps is called a "parabola,"...

00:08.625 --> 00:11.698
...and on each parabola what you feel is 20 seconds of double gravity...

00:11.775 --> 00:13.657
...while the plane is throwing you into the air.

00:13.976 --> 00:17.320
Then you feel weightless for about 27 seconds while you go up over the top...

00:17.476 --> 00:19.111
...but kind of sail back towards the ground.

00:19.272 --> 00:21.199
Then at the bottom, the plane catches you again,...

00:21.278 --> 00:23.415
...and you feel 20 more seconds of double gravity.

00:23.705 --> 00:26.023
After the whole maneuver is done, you've lost a lot of altitude...

00:26.131 --> 00:28.794
...so it takes about four or five minutes for the plane...

00:28.920 --> 00:30.839
...to gear back up to do it all over again.

00:31.181 --> 00:34.452
The song itself moves in musical sections that are 21 seconds.

00:34.705 --> 00:36.744
Each verse of the song is 21 seconds.

00:36.977 --> 00:38.801
Each round of the chorus is 21 seconds.

00:38.996 --> 00:44.239
The way we made the 21 seconds of song match the 27 seconds of zero gravity...

00:44.313 --> 00:48.539
...was we slowed the playback of the song down, about 28.5 percent.

00:48.991 --> 00:50.416
Here's what we looked like in real time.

01:09.241 --> 01:11.745
And then when it was done, we sped the whole thing back up,...

01:11.896 --> 01:15.610
...which also combated the kind of drifty, floaty slo-mo effect...

01:15.742 --> 01:17.665
...that everything gets in zero-g.

01:18.988 --> 01:22.244
I mean, it is truly unbelievable that everything just came together.

01:22.535 --> 01:26.705
There were so many variables, so many unknowns, so many challenges.

01:27.733 --> 01:31.792
Basically, I'm still sighing big sighs of relief that it happened.
