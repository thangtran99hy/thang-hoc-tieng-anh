00:04.638 --> 00:08.073
Red panda in name, it is not closely related to the giant panda,...

00:08.445 --> 00:10.531
...but actually closer to the raccoon family.

00:11.746 --> 00:12.859
He loves to eat bamboo...

00:13.183 --> 00:16.718
...but won't turn down the occasional bird, insect or mammal for a snack.

00:18.381 --> 00:21.016
Native to the Eastern Himalayas and Southwestern China,...

00:21.353 --> 00:24.367
...red pandas live in trees and are nimble, agile climbers.

00:25.473 --> 00:27.383
Their reddish brown fur and bushy tails...

00:27.460 --> 00:30.745
...camouflage them in their habitat from predators like snow leopards.

00:31.907 --> 00:34.448
Besides other animals, humans pose a major threat,...

00:34.789 --> 00:36.561
...poaching and hunting them for their fur.

00:37.316 --> 00:39.215
The forest that they live in are shrinking fast...

00:39.475 --> 00:42.147
...and estimates say that their population has been cut in half...

00:42.321 --> 00:43.629
...in the last 20 years.

00:45.491 --> 00:47.132
This is the red panda.
