The first thing we're going to do is pour a few drops of the nail polish...

00:03.041 --> 00:04.481
...unto the surface of our water.

00:04.625 --> 00:06.535
And we have to work quickly because it will dry.

00:08.463 --> 00:10.247
Use your toothpick to swirl the colors around...

00:10.305 --> 00:11.663
..until you find a pattern that you like.

00:14.051 --> 00:15.647
And then dip in your coffee mug.

00:18.940 --> 00:22.730
And there you have it: a beautiful DIY watercolor coffee mug.
