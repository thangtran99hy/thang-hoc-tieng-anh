00:00.907 --> 00:04.053
Now, for our tree egg with some engraving on the outside...

00:04.137 --> 00:07.059
...and some little eggs in a nest on the inside.

00:07.798 --> 00:12.825
Fill a mold with white chocolate, tip out the excess and place it upside down.

00:13.087 --> 00:17.681
Once it's set, take off your mold then use a pastry brush...

00:17.849 --> 00:20.483
...and brush some dark chocolate over the top.

00:20.570 --> 00:23.055
And we want it to look rough like tree bark,...

00:23.133 --> 00:25.807
...so we're not trying to get it smooth, just brush it over.

00:26.702 --> 00:31.668
Once that has set, draw the outline of a heart on top using a knife...

00:31.973 --> 00:35.075
...and then gently scrape away some of the dark chocolate...

00:35.156 --> 00:37.207
...so that you can see the white underneath.

00:37.310 --> 00:40.171
Don't go too deep or you're going to make a hole in your egg.

00:40.676 --> 00:44.356
Then use your knife to scrape off the heart area...

00:44.468 --> 00:46.840
...and it doesn't matter that it looks a bit, sort of rough...

00:46.981 --> 00:50.213
...because that's what it would look like if you were scraping bark off a tree.

00:50.701 --> 00:56.161
Place some chocolate into a piping bag and pipe on the initials of your choice.

00:56.876 --> 01:00.673
Now, inside this egg I'm going to use pashmak to make a nest.

01:00.777 --> 01:05.957
Now, pashmak is a Persian fairy floss and it's sweet with a slightly nutty flavor.

01:06.052 --> 01:08.789
I really like it and it looks amazing.

01:09.327 --> 01:14.107
Then add some little eggs to the inside, and what a cute little nest.

01:14.667 --> 01:17.611
Place the top half onto a hot baking tray...

01:17.817 --> 01:20.094
...and then add it on top of the egg...

01:20.172 --> 01:23.587
...and you'd probably want to serve this one sitting flat in a box.
