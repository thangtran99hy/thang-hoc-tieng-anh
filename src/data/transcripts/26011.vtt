00:02.958 --> 00:04.325
I remember my first drawing.

00:04.478 --> 00:07.963
It was a horse that I drew right on a pencil box...

00:08.021 --> 00:10.373
...when I was probably three or four years old.

00:10.429 --> 00:15.363
And I remember that day possibly because that realization struck me:...

00:15.781 --> 00:18.321
...anything in the world can be translated into a picture...

00:18.389 --> 00:20.890
...and I, in fact, possess that magical power,...

00:20.965 --> 00:23.934
...the ability of turning things into pictures.
