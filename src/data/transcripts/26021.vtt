Diving is an activity to carry out in pairs.

00:03.617 --> 00:05.713
It is critical that buddies support each other...

00:05.764 --> 00:08.737
...starting at the preparatory phase for a well-planned dive.

00:11.987 --> 00:15.313
When you are getting ready for a dive, make sure you proceed...

00:15.424 --> 00:16.859
...at the same pace of your buddies...

00:17.987 --> 00:19.989
...so that you are all ready at the same time.

00:20.748 --> 00:22.973
In this way, you will not have to wait for the others...

00:23.057 --> 00:24.578
...with your suit on and overheat.

00:26.493 --> 00:29.928
If you do overheat, cool down and never accumulate excessive heat.

00:32.196 --> 00:35.708
Once the gear is on, do the buddy check and then enter the water,...

00:36.031 --> 00:37.439
...ready for the real adventure.

00:44.849 --> 00:47.250
Remember that as soon as you are on the surface,...

00:47.424 --> 00:49.645
...you should exchange the snorkel with the regulator...

00:49.807 --> 00:51.545
...so that you can save air in the tank.

00:56.541 --> 00:59.181
Swim on the surface until you get to the descent point...

00:59.246 --> 01:00.475
...the instructor will indicate.

01:01.033 --> 01:02.936
Exchange the snorkel with the regulator...

01:03.170 --> 01:04.811
...and start the descent with your buddy.

01:07.171 --> 01:10.382
Remember to equalize your ears as soon as you start the descent...

01:10.729 --> 01:12.533
...and give the OK signal to your buddy.
