ï»¿I got into climbing during college.

00:03.404 --> 00:06.184
I just like to go into the woods and have a reason to be there...

00:06.265 --> 00:07.363
...and have fun with friends.

00:09.109 --> 00:10.639
I've been climbing like a year and a half.

00:10.924 --> 00:14.008
I like that it forces to have this Zen state.

00:14.314 --> 00:18.057
It's a really good mental practice for every other challenge in your life.

00:18.980 --> 00:21.985
Our weekends usually begin Friday at about 3 PM.

00:22.289 --> 00:26.469
We decide on the goal, collect some friends, climb until sunset...

00:26.791 --> 00:28.080
...and wake up the next day.

00:28.482 --> 00:29.228
Do it all over again.

00:29.347 --> 00:29.496
Yeah.
