I really want to be able to live in a world where technology is like oxygen.

00:13.451 --> 00:17.359
It's obviously vitally important and it's ubiquitous, it's everywhere.

00:17.666 --> 00:18.873
But you don't ever see it.

00:19.133 --> 00:20.515
And you don't ever think about it.

00:20.599 --> 00:23.069
It's just there, and it works, and it helps you.

00:23.589 --> 00:26.270
I hate when it starts to affect my social relationships...

00:26.338 --> 00:27.829
...and my interactions with people.

00:28.215 --> 00:31.679
I'm all for living a digitally connected lifestyle,...

00:32.137 --> 00:35.661
...provided I'm given the option to turn down my level of connectedness...

00:35.743 --> 00:37.135
...at certain points in the day.

00:37.822 --> 00:41.174
That means giving myself breaks from my smartphone or my computer screen...

00:41.519 --> 00:44.725
...when I'm trying to be creative or when I need to de-stress,...

00:44.815 --> 00:47.925
...and when I really want to concentrate at the task or the person at hand.

00:49.492 --> 00:53.630
Our solution was to create a line of designer jewelry that subtly vibrates...

00:53.775 --> 00:56.104
...only when something important happens on your phone.

00:57.070 --> 01:00.087
Our smartphone app allows you to predefine profiles.

01:00.201 --> 01:01.401
And then within each profile,...

01:01.727 --> 01:04.365
...you can select which notifications pass through the filter...

01:04.458 --> 01:06.029
...and make the jewelry vibrate.

01:06.665 --> 01:08.517
I definitely think there's possibilities...

01:08.669 --> 01:11.647
...that allow us to do kind of many amazing things.

01:11.748 --> 01:13.894
So, now I think this is just the beginning.
