00:04.834 --> 00:06.383
Poor, sweet, little cub.

00:06.961 --> 00:08.777
What are you doing so deep in the jungle?

00:10.672 --> 00:13.464
You are a man-cub who wants to live in a jungle.

00:13.633 --> 00:14.629
How do you know that?

00:14.854 --> 00:16.227
Kid, I got ears.

00:16.353 --> 00:18.031
My ears got ears.

00:18.128 --> 00:19.887
Only I can protect you.

00:24.413 --> 00:27.747
Forget about your worries and your strife.

00:28.222 --> 00:28.545
What's that?

00:28.682 --> 00:30.139
That's a song about the good life.

00:33.393 --> 00:34.943
Come on, Mowgli, let's be on our way.

00:35.068 --> 00:37.617
But I'm helping Baloo get ready for hibernation.

00:37.821 --> 00:39.979
Bears don't hibernate in a jungle.

00:40.331 --> 00:42.377
Not full hibernation but I nap.

00:42.631 --> 00:43.073
A lot.
