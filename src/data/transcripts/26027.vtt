ï»¿One day, the last star will die and the universe will turn dark forever.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.673
It will probably be a red dwarf.

00:09.035 --> 00:10.241
A tiny kind of star...

00:10.463 --> 00:13.173
...that's also one of our best bets to find alien life...

00:13.372 --> 00:17.483
...and might be the last home of humanity before the universe becomes uninhabitable.

00:18.137 --> 00:19.791
So, what do we know about them?

00:20.131 --> 00:22.092
And why are they our last hope?

00:31.985 --> 00:35.629
At least 70 percent of stars in the universe are red dwarfs.

00:36.039 --> 00:37.843
They are the tiniest stars out there...

00:38.057 --> 00:41.280
...with only about 7 to 50 percent of the mass of our sun.

00:41.647 --> 00:45.553
Not that much bigger than our planet Jupiter, which is still huge though.

00:46.490 --> 00:49.301
Life on Earth has existed for about four billion years.

00:49.591 --> 00:53.184
And we have about a billion years left before the sun becomes so hot...

00:53.387 --> 00:55.446
...that complex life on Earth will become impossible.

00:56.004 --> 00:59.343
We will either die out or leave Earth and look for a new home.

00:59.919 --> 01:03.129
We could build a civilization for potentially trillions of years...

01:03.194 --> 01:05.333
...around a red dwarf with the right conditions.

01:05.999 --> 01:09.769
About five percent of the red dwarfs in the Milky Way may host habitable,...

01:10.025 --> 01:11.631
...roughly Earth-sized planets.

01:12.007 --> 01:14.676
That would be more than four billion in total.

01:15.623 --> 01:19.615
Anyway, it's going to be a long time before the last stars in the universe vanish.

01:19.892 --> 01:21.179
It's kind of uplifting to know...

01:21.249 --> 01:23.779
...that if humanity succeeds in venturing into space,...

01:24.165 --> 01:27.433
...we have plenty of time before the universe turns out the lights.
