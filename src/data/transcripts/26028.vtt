Hey everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley...

00:02.258 --> 00:03.947
...and this is my life.

00:04.182 --> 00:08.783
I was born March 22nd 1989 in Jackson, Michigan at Foote Hospital.

00:08.934 --> 00:10.577
My parents were divorced when I was a toddler...

00:10.705 --> 00:12.507
...so I've always had two families.

00:12.571 --> 00:15.313
Between my sisters and my stepbrothers and my stepsisters...

00:15.415 --> 00:18.200
...and my half-brother and my in-laws, I have 12 siblings total.

00:18.581 --> 00:20.597
In elementary school, I had to get glasses...

00:20.698 --> 00:23.158
...so my parents let me pick out whatever pair I wanted.

00:23.346 --> 00:26.417
So, I got these big round glasses that were bright purple.

00:26.589 --> 00:28.457
It was basically the start of my fabulosity.

00:28.741 --> 00:31.803
Back then, I began to develop a bit of an addictive personality.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.634
No matter what it was that I was obsessed with,...

00:33.849 --> 00:35.925
...I had to have everything involved with it.

00:36.118 --> 00:38.233
When it was pogs, I had my own pog maker.

00:38.450 --> 00:41.928
When it was Beanie Babies, I had tag protectors and value handbooks.

00:42.048 --> 00:45.638
When it was Pokemon, I competed at local video game stores and tournaments.

00:45.799 --> 00:48.357
I guess that's why nowadays I can't get off Tumblr.
