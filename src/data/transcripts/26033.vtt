00:00.683 --> 00:02.415
Do you have any experience of caregiving?

00:03.017 --> 00:04.959
I've never done it, but I'm sure I could learn.

00:05.155 --> 00:06.021
Then let's go and meet Will.

00:07.080 --> 00:08.702
Will, this is Louisa Clark.

00:08.879 --> 00:11.199
Nathan will talk you through Will's routines and equipment.

00:11.265 --> 00:12.655
You don't have to talk across me, mother.

00:12.749 --> 00:15.180
My brain isn't paralyzed... yet.

00:16.828 --> 00:17.308
Good morning.

00:18.927 --> 00:19.616
He hates me.

00:19.695 --> 00:22.059
Every time I speak, he looks at me like I'm stupid.

00:22.275 --> 00:24.045
To be fair, you are pretty stupid.

00:24.173 --> 00:25.897
Yeah, but he doesn't know that yet.

00:26.935 --> 00:28.495
No, stay.

00:29.056 --> 00:30.359
Tell me something good.

00:30.816 --> 00:36.401
When I was little, my favorite outfit was my bumblebee tights.

00:36.611 --> 00:37.569
Bumblebee tights.

00:37.660 --> 00:38.719
Black and yellow stripes.

00:38.788 --> 00:39.821
Oh, dear God.

00:39.886 --> 00:41.517
Didn't you ever love anything that much?

00:42.248 --> 00:42.785
Yes.

00:44.726 --> 00:48.089
I don't want you to miss all the things that someone else could give you.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.360
But I can make you happy.

00:57.738 --> 01:01.480
I have become a whole new person because of you.

01:04.027 --> 01:05.162
Do you know something, Clark?

01:05.376 --> 01:08.234
You are pretty much the only thing that makes me want to get up in the morning.
