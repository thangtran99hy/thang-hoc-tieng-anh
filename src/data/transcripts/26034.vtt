Hi, my name is Saoirse Ronan...

00:02.691 --> 00:08.647
...and today, I'm going to teach you America how to make the perfect cup of tea.

00:09.136 --> 00:12.157
You fill up your kettle to the desired amount.

00:12.263 --> 00:15.742
So, this is filled up to five cups...

00:16.279 --> 00:17.614
...so we can all have a cup of tea.

00:18.512 --> 00:23.354
You don't use  your kettle to actually serve the tea.

00:23.596 --> 00:24.537
That's wrong.

00:25.135 --> 00:26.350
You have a teapot.

00:26.891 --> 00:28.336
Put your tea bag in there.

00:28.631 --> 00:30.253
You'd have to, usually.

00:30.910 --> 00:32.049
So, we're gonna leave that in there.

00:32.499 --> 00:34.987
Anyway, your kettle's boiled.

00:35.900 --> 00:37.337
You fill up your teapot.

00:39.688 --> 00:41.043
Have your tea bag in there.

00:41.477 --> 00:44.235
Let it brew for about three minutes.

00:44.351 --> 00:45.727
Make sure it's nice and strong.

00:45.900 --> 00:46.903
Pour your tea.

00:48.657 --> 00:49.784
Put your milk in.

00:52.263 --> 00:54.875
It looks awful from here but the idea is there.

00:55.096 --> 00:56.037
Have your cup of tea.

00:56.252 --> 00:57.602
Have a shortbread biscuit.

00:57.851 --> 01:00.649
There you go, life is instantly better for you.
