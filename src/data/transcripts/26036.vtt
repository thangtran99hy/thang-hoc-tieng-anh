00:00.379 --> 00:00.757
ï»¿Pull.

00:01.428 --> 00:01.853
Turn.

00:02.325 --> 00:02.756
Nice.

00:05.675 --> 00:06.182
That was awesome.

00:07.183 --> 00:07.739
Good job!

00:08.951 --> 00:12.016
I'm gonna take her off the groomed terrain for the first time...

00:12.273 --> 00:14.183
...into some powder, into some bumps.

00:15.021 --> 00:16.009
Peter was so helpful.

00:16.093 --> 00:19.360
You know, I think that when it comes to learning something new,...

00:19.999 --> 00:21.225
...it's all about your mindset,...

00:21.557 --> 00:25.405
...and it's all about staying positive and if I fall, I fall.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.674
I'm gonna get up and I'm gonna keep going, that's how you learn.

00:29.447 --> 00:33.805
I have been in the snow involuntarily a couple of times.

00:34.191 --> 00:35.873
I'm still coming out dry.

00:36.093 --> 00:37.840
I've got an Omni-Heat Base Layer on...

00:37.963 --> 00:40.756
...and just my shell, and it's been plenty for me.

00:40.839 --> 00:44.447
I've stayed warm, I've stayed dry, and I've been out all day.

00:45.941 --> 00:48.603
The Olympic downhill run was awesome, I didn't even realize...

00:48.944 --> 00:52.401
...that we were on a black diamond until we were near the bottom.
