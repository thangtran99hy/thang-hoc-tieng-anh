00:03.335 --> 00:07.306
All the animals loved this elephant for how he played the game.

00:14.525 --> 00:15.652
I quit.

00:17.077 --> 00:21.051
He just played to enjoy himself and wasn't looking for fame.

00:21.567 --> 00:23.303
It's no use getting mad.

00:23.426 --> 00:24.659
It's just a game.

00:25.224 --> 00:28.146
You're right, I'm sorry for getting upset.

00:28.567 --> 00:33.594
So in sports, it's not that important to win every single time,...

00:33.725 --> 00:36.648
...much more important is to have fun.

00:36.943 --> 00:39.597
So ends this verse of rhyme.
