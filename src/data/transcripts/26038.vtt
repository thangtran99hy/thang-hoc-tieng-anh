When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is...

00:05.729 --> 00:10.276
..and your life is just to live your life inside the world.

00:10.363 --> 00:12.407
Try not to bash into the walls too much.

00:13.321 --> 00:17.110
Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.773
That's a very limited life.

00:22.882 --> 00:26.300
Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact.

00:26.857 --> 00:29.345
And that is everything around you that you call life...

00:29.937 --> 00:33.089
...was made up by people that were no smarter than you.

00:34.017 --> 00:36.467
And you can change it, you can influence it,...

00:36.567 --> 00:40.109
...you can build your own things that other people can use.
