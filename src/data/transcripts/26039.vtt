00:00.054 --> 00:02.628
So there's this inherent conflict in the system though,...

00:02.729 --> 00:07.818
...which is: Are we trying to optimize News Feed to give each person, all of you guys,...

00:08.137 --> 00:09.697
...the best experience when you're reading?

00:10.034 --> 00:13.637
Or are we trying to help businesses just reach as many people as possible?

00:13.945 --> 00:17.177
And in every decision that we make, we optimize for the first,...

00:17.334 --> 00:21.929
...for making it so that the people who we serve, who use Facebook,...

00:22.006 --> 00:25.211
...and who are reading News Feed get the very best experience that they can.

00:25.436 --> 00:29.349
And that means that if a business is sharing content that's gonna be useful for them,...

00:29.667 --> 00:30.784
...then we'll show that.

00:31.121 --> 00:34.371
But that means if the business is sharing content that isn't gonna be useful for them,...

00:35.066 --> 00:35.835
...we may not show that.

00:35.979 --> 00:38.697
Because it's probably more important that they learn about their friend...

00:38.764 --> 00:40.572
...who had a baby and their baby is healthy.
