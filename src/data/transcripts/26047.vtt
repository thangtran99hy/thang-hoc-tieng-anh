ï»¿The Dog and The Bone.

00:04.781 --> 00:10.255
Once a stray dog passing by a butcher shop found a nice, juicy piece of bone.

00:12.219 --> 00:13.836
The dog was very pleased.

00:14.380 --> 00:19.095
He clutched the bone hard with his teeth and ran towards the woods to eat it.

00:20.833 --> 00:23.827
He then had to walk across the bridge over a stream...

00:24.575 --> 00:26.427
...through the gaps in the wooden bridge.

00:26.904 --> 00:29.427
The dog could see his own reflection.

00:31.237 --> 00:34.787
But the foolish dog thought it was another dog staring at him...

00:35.167 --> 00:37.597
...with a nice juicy bone in his mouth.

00:39.262 --> 00:43.397
He decided that he had to have the other dog's bone as well.

00:43.925 --> 00:45.637
The greedy fellow barked.

00:46.230 --> 00:49.383
As soon as he did this, the bone fell into the water.

00:51.357 --> 00:54.951
The poor dog was terribly upset at losing his bone...

00:55.447 --> 00:59.175
...but he said to himself, "Let that be a lesson to me."

00:59.460 --> 01:01.405
"Never to be so greedy again."
