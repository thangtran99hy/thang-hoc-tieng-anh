For O'Brien, becoming one of the North Shore's leading water men...

00:04.531 --> 00:05.979
...is a story that's already in the making.

00:06.557 --> 00:08.743
Victory at Pipe would cement that reputation.

00:09.793 --> 00:13.101
Off here in Hawaii, we concentrate on surfing Pipeline, that's our everything.

00:13.365 --> 00:15.944
It's like you're born right into it, you don't have a choice.

00:17.665 --> 00:20.783
For now, Rothman seems content as an up-and-coming surfer...

00:20.845 --> 00:24.051
...setting a new standard for youngsters and waves of consequence.

00:24.663 --> 00:28.026
Many of his peers expect big things of him when the contest gets going.

00:28.990 --> 00:32.145
I feel like I have a good understanding of Pipe, I would love to win.

00:33.679 --> 00:37.065
As for Lau, it's not that long since he had to make a tough decision...

00:37.271 --> 00:38.441
...about his sporting future.

00:38.905 --> 00:42.570
Like all life choices, the conclusion lies ahead, not yet known.

00:43.202 --> 00:46.367
But if Lau has his way, it's a future of life on the world tour,...

00:46.919 --> 00:49.053
...the ultimate dream for most pro surfers.

00:49.475 --> 00:51.401
When it comes game day, you gotta be willing to perform.

00:51.529 --> 00:53.438
You gotta love the struggle, you gotta love every part of it.

00:53.576 --> 00:54.795
You gotta love the good and the bad.
