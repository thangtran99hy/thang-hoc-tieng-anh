There are plenty of studies that demonstrate yoga's potential for health.

00:04.843 --> 00:08.689
For example, Oxford University found that people who practice yoga...

00:08.786 --> 00:11.107
...even once a week were less stressed out,...

00:11.608 --> 00:13.815
...had lower blood pressure and slept better at night.

00:14.681 --> 00:17.142
And yoga is not just good for your mental health.

00:17.967 --> 00:19.945
According to the National Institute of Health,...

00:20.414 --> 00:22.862
...it's proven to help with musculoskeletal issues...

00:22.986 --> 00:24.365
...especially lower back pain.

00:24.753 --> 00:26.383
It can even help relieve asthma.

00:28.047 --> 00:30.050
There are tons of different types of yoga...

00:30.496 --> 00:33.390
...all with names that are kind of difficult to remember.

00:33.961 --> 00:37.820
There's hatha, bikram, vinyasa, the list goes on.

00:38.970 --> 00:41.523
And while some types do encourage a hard workout...

00:41.627 --> 00:44.855
...where you bend and flex in insane positions and sweat bullets,...

00:45.635 --> 00:48.625
...yoga can more simply be just used as a meditative tool.

00:49.215 --> 00:51.597
And you get the same mental health benefits.
