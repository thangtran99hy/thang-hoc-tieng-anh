Yes, it is true.

00:02.085 --> 00:06.648
I lost the presidential election in 2012 to Mr. Barack Obama.

00:07.005 --> 00:10.051
But that is only because I thought the world was ending.

00:10.317 --> 00:14.787
So, I withdrew from the election and hid under a rock on top of me.

00:15.081 --> 00:17.359
But now in 2016,...

00:17.460 --> 00:20.787
...it is finally time for me to formally announce to the country,...

00:20.907 --> 00:21.852
...no, the world,...

00:21.975 --> 00:23.659
...no, the entire city,...

00:23.803 --> 00:28.822
...that I, Ryan Higa, will once again be running four...

00:29.117 --> 00:32.424
...kilometers down the road to the registrations office...

00:32.515 --> 00:34.459
...where I will fill out all my information...

00:34.679 --> 00:37.106
...to run for president, again!
