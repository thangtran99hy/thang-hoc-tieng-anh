Tell me what you know about Easter.

00:02.205 --> 00:03.130
It's about Jesus.

00:03.939 --> 00:05.775
What does Jesus have to do with Easter?

00:09.539 --> 00:13.413
One time, I heard this in a movie it said that Easter was about hope.

00:13.722 --> 00:16.674
Jesus does wonderful things for people.

00:17.730 --> 00:21.786
He died on the cross for our sin...

00:22.445 --> 00:28.055
...so no more bad things will happen to us or no more things.

00:29.606 --> 00:34.023
They just hanged Jesus up because they didn't like Jesus.

00:35.140 --> 00:39.330
Some soldiers nailed Jesus to the cross...

00:39.711 --> 00:43.499
...and bled everywhere until he died.
