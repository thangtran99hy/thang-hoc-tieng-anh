The Universe.

00:18.040 --> 00:19.631
Rather beautiful, isn't it?

00:20.728 --> 00:22.728
It's quite literally got everything,...

00:23.239 --> 00:25.321
...from the very big to the very small.

00:26.383 --> 00:28.982
Sure, there are some less than savory elements in there,...

00:29.050 --> 00:34.094
...but on the whole, scholars agree that its existence is probably a good thing.

00:34.963 --> 00:38.425
Such a good thing that an entire field of scientific endeavor...

00:38.668 --> 00:39.860
...is devoted to its study.

00:40.902 --> 00:42.701
This is known as "cosmology."

00:43.435 --> 00:46.149
Cosmologists look at what's out there in space...

00:46.419 --> 00:49.952
...and piece together the tale of how our universe evolved.

00:50.306 --> 00:52.702
What it's doing now, what it's going to be doing,...

00:53.117 --> 00:54.637
...and how it all began in the first place.
