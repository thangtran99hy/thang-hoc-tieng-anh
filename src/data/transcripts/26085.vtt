I have come here to bury the last remnant of the cold war in the Americas.

00:11.263 --> 00:14.805
I have come here to extend the hand of friendship to the Cuban people.

00:18.649 --> 00:19.681
I wanna be clear.

00:19.791 --> 00:23.580
The differences between our governments over these many years are real,...

00:23.712 --> 00:25.159
...and they are important.

00:26.971 --> 00:29.459
I'm sure President Castro would say the same thing.

00:30.333 --> 00:33.379
I know because I've heard him address those differences at length.

00:36.297 --> 00:38.087
But before I discuss those issues,...

00:38.191 --> 00:40.527
...we also need to recognize how much we share.

00:42.155 --> 00:43.145
Because in many ways,...

00:43.237 --> 00:45.452
...the United States and Cuba are like two brothers...

00:45.573 --> 00:47.619
...who've been estranged for many years,...

00:48.187 --> 00:49.932
...even as we share the same blood.
