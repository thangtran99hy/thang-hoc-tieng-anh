ï»¿Today is the day!

00:08.085 --> 00:10.735
Our field trip to the stingray migration.

00:10.788 --> 00:11.719
Stingray Migration.

00:13.196 --> 00:15.885
Migration is about going home...

00:15.943 --> 00:16.220
Home.

00:16.273 --> 00:17.552
...which is where you're from.

00:17.637 --> 00:19.445
How do the stingrays all know where to go?

00:19.627 --> 00:20.185
Instinct,...

00:20.413 --> 00:24.301
...something deep inside you that feels so familiar that you have to listen to it.

00:24.882 --> 00:27.104
My mom, my dad, I have a family.

00:27.928 --> 00:29.997
We will never forget you, Dory.

00:30.167 --> 00:31.796
What if I forget you?

00:33.142 --> 00:33.811
I miss them.

00:34.883 --> 00:35.876
You know what that feels like?

00:36.651 --> 00:37.090
Yes.

00:37.362 --> 00:38.255
Then we better get going!

00:41.884 --> 00:43.436
Totally sick.

00:43.541 --> 00:44.172
Isn't it great?

00:44.224 --> 00:44.547
No!

00:44.864 --> 00:46.521
I'm gonna be totally sick.

00:49.017 --> 00:49.644
Can you help me...

00:50.837 --> 00:52.072
Sorry, not a great swimmer.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.301
I think you swam beautifully.

00:53.372 --> 00:54.517
Thank you.

00:54.571 --> 00:56.642
You're welcome.

00:56.712 --> 00:56.759
Wait.

00:57.302 --> 00:57.778
Dory?

00:57.968 --> 00:58.431
Yes?

00:58.523 --> 00:58.815
Dory!

00:58.867 --> 00:59.336
Yes.

00:59.474 --> 01:00.631
You and I were friends!

01:00.772 --> 01:01.182
No.

01:01.274 --> 01:02.977
It was so much fun 'cause I'd tell you a story...

01:03.047 --> 01:04.417
...and then you'd completely forget about it...

01:04.591 --> 01:06.389
...and then I get to tell it to you over and over again.
