Friends, for my final foolish treat,...

00:03.140 --> 00:05.486
...a hack best described by one word:...

00:05.875 --> 00:06.387
...sweet.

00:06.935 --> 00:09.018
Its comedy level is rated tops.

00:09.440 --> 00:12.299
I call it my April Fools' Brocco Pops.

00:13.114 --> 00:19.049
For this, you'll need lollipops with wrappers, broccoli, scissors and that's all.

00:19.991 --> 00:23.196
Take off the wrapper and remove the candy from the stick...

00:23.588 --> 00:24.783
...however you want.

00:28.092 --> 00:31.081
Cut pieces of broccoli in round shapes to look like a lollipop.

00:40.054 --> 00:42.125
Stick the broccoli onto the lollipop stick,...

00:43.575 --> 00:45.093
...then cover it with the wrapper.

00:50.392 --> 00:51.339
Here Joy, want one?

00:54.293 --> 00:55.653
Ew, gross.
