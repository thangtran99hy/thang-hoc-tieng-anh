Here's a thought.

00:04.267 --> 00:07.189
If there was a prize for most screenwriting credits,...

00:07.593 --> 00:10.947
...we'd have one of those "unfortunately, he can't be here with us tonight" moments.

00:11.441 --> 00:15.109
That's because the winner, with over a thousand, is William Shakespeare.

00:15.729 --> 00:18.621
But how can a man who died long before the invention of cinema...

00:18.781 --> 00:20.551
...have racked up so many credits?

00:20.827 --> 00:26.907
Simple. By creating the most moving, exciting and enduring stories ever written.

00:27.490 --> 00:29.657
Shakespeare showed us what it means to be human.

00:30.178 --> 00:33.787
We've all been lovesick or heartbroken like Romeo and Juliet,...

00:34.257 --> 00:37.231
...or felt Macbeth's burn of greed and ambition.

00:37.649 --> 00:40.138
And who hasn't experienced jealousy like Othello?

00:40.875 --> 00:45.284
No wonder artists around the globe are still eager to adapt Will's works.

00:46.295 --> 00:50.579
Yes, he may have died 400 years ago, but Shakespeare lives.
