ï»¿Hello, can you hear me?

00:05.721 --> 00:11.283
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be,...

00:11.651 --> 00:15.940
...when we were younger and free.

00:17.792 --> 00:23.411
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet.

00:23.635 --> 00:34.795
There's such a difference between us and a million miles.

00:36.421 --> 00:41.466
Hello from the other side.

00:42.469 --> 00:47.665
I must've called a thousand times...

00:48.323 --> 00:53.856
...to tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done.

00:53.967 --> 01:00.447
But when I call, you never seem to be home.

01:00.906 --> 01:06.652
So, hello from the outside.

01:07.169 --> 01:12.673
At least I can say that I've tried...

01:12.765 --> 01:18.362
...to tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart.

01:18.507 --> 01:28.163
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore.
