Nice to meet you, where you've been? I could show you incredible things.

00:06.378 --> 00:08.655
Magic, madness, heaven, sin.

00:08.873 --> 00:13.135
Saw you there and I thought, "Oh my God, look at that face."

00:13.235 --> 00:15.355
"You look like my next mistake."

00:15.717 --> 00:20.004
Love's a game, wanna play?

00:21.389 --> 00:26.107
New money, suit and tie, I can read you like a magazine.

00:26.248 --> 00:30.819
Ain't it funny, rumors fly and I know you heard about me.

00:30.904 --> 00:35.621
So hey, let's be friends. I'm dying to see how this one ends.

00:35.739 --> 00:37.873
Grab your passport and my hand.

00:38.247 --> 00:40.715
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend.

00:41.058 --> 00:45.710
So, it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames.

00:46.069 --> 00:50.657
You can tell me when it's over, if the high was worth the pain.

00:51.051 --> 00:55.659
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane.

00:55.955 --> 01:00.883
'Cause you know I love the players and you love the game.

01:01.032 --> 01:05.706
'Cause we're young and we're reckless, we'll take this way too far.

01:06.015 --> 01:10.689
It'll leave you breathless or with a nasty scar.

01:11.064 --> 01:15.637
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane.

01:16.380 --> 01:19.116
But I've got a blank space, baby.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.177
And I'll write your name.
