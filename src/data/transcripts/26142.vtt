This is "Make You Feel My Love," and this is for Brussels.

00:21.089 --> 00:26.712
When the rain is blowing in your face...

00:27.750 --> 00:33.309
...and the whole world is on your case,...

00:34.335 --> 00:39.479
...I could offer you a warm embrace...

00:40.617 --> 00:45.269
...to make you feel my love.

00:47.171 --> 00:52.711
When the evening shadows and the stars appear,...

00:54.011 --> 00:59.575
...and there is no one there to dry your tears,...

01:00.911 --> 01:05.867
...I could hold you for a million years...

01:07.198 --> 01:11.482
...to make you feel my love.
