ï»¿Sometimes in our lives we all have pain, we all have sorrow.

00:12.887 --> 00:22.865
But, if we are wise, we know that there's always tomorrow.

00:23.247 --> 00:27.583
Lean on me when you're not strong.

00:28.449 --> 00:35.719
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on.

00:35.829 --> 00:46.163
For it won't be long 'til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on.

00:46.501 --> 00:51.882
So, just call on me, brother, when you need a hand.

00:52.321 --> 00:57.311
We all need somebody to lean on.

00:58.035 --> 01:03.240
I just might have a problem that you'll understand.

01:03.720 --> 01:09.139
We all need somebody to lean on.
