00:00.952 --> 00:05.356
A whole new world,...

00:05.697 --> 00:09.909
...a dazzling place I never knew.

00:10.234 --> 00:15.231
But when I'm way up here, it's crystal clear...

00:15.555 --> 00:22.303
...that now I'm in a whole new world with you.

00:24.415 --> 00:29.627
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon.

00:30.163 --> 00:33.873
For whether we are white or copper-skinned,...

00:34.417 --> 00:39.204
...we need to sing with all the voices of the mountains.

00:39.573 --> 00:45.595
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind.

00:46.059 --> 00:55.057
Who is that girl I see staring straight back at me?

00:55.908 --> 01:04.771
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?

01:04.843 --> 01:09.574
How do you know he loves you?

01:10.255 --> 01:15.415
How do you know he's yours?

01:15.519 --> 01:21.291
Well does he leave a little note to tell you you are on his mind?

01:22.007 --> 01:26.816
Send you yellow flowers when the sky is gray?

01:27.463 --> 01:29.815
That's how you know.

01:30.172 --> 01:35.177
That's how you know he's your love.
