ï»¿Don't let them in, don't let them see.

00:07.143 --> 00:10.156
Be the good girl you always have to be.

00:10.723 --> 00:16.372
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know.

00:16.835 --> 00:19.610
Well, now they know.

00:19.737 --> 00:23.161
Let it go, let it go.

00:23.456 --> 00:26.703
And I'll rise like the break of dawn.

00:26.926 --> 00:30.163
Let it go, let it go.

00:30.479 --> 00:34.107
That perfect girl is gone.

00:34.432 --> 00:36.747
Here I stand,...

00:37.033 --> 00:40.675
...in the light of day.

00:40.899 --> 00:46.142
Let the storm rage on.

00:46.611 --> 00:49.761
The cold never bothered me anyway.
