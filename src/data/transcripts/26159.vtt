Suppose there's a company called Bull Flag Cycling.

00:02.959 --> 00:04.271
This company makes bikes.

00:04.600 --> 00:05.559
Really good bikes.

00:05.981 --> 00:08.841
The bikes are so good in fact, the company wants to expand...

00:09.033 --> 00:11.645
...so it can sell more bikes to people all around the world.

00:12.405 --> 00:16.132
To do this, the company needs to raise money, also known as capital.

00:16.665 --> 00:18.730
There a few ways this company could do this.

00:19.014 --> 00:20.080
They could take out a loan.

00:20.295 --> 00:22.535
But that would mean taking on a significant amount of debt.

00:23.050 --> 00:25.047
Or it could issue shares of stock.

00:25.615 --> 00:28.103
By issuing stock, which is called going public,...

00:28.218 --> 00:30.707
...the company can raise money without going into debt.

00:31.209 --> 00:35.494
Instead, it sells shares of ownership and a claim on future earnings to investors.
