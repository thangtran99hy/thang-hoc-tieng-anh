My name is Adnan and I've been learning Mandarin inside school.

00:03.881 --> 00:06.590
I wanna be into banking 'cause it's lots of money.

00:06.717 --> 00:09.701
Maybe I can get lots of deals by talking to Chinese people.

00:10.939 --> 00:13.284
We're not learning something that we used to...

00:13.398 --> 00:16.129
...and it's not like anything we've ever done before.

00:16.351 --> 00:18.988
We're just used to doing English and maths,...

00:19.101 --> 00:22.189
...but now we're gonna learn a completely new language.

00:22.593 --> 00:24.233
It's actually really unique.

00:24.589 --> 00:27.419
It's really interesting and it's fun to do.

00:28.063 --> 00:31.881
You become more confident as a person being able to communicate with others.

00:32.157 --> 00:36.205
I think Spanish is really useful because 40 plus countries speak Spanish.

00:36.357 --> 00:39.141
So, I think business-wise it's gonna be helpful in the future.

00:39.403 --> 00:44.183
Maths and English, it's more like, write on your books and look at the board...

00:44.271 --> 00:46.251
...but here, we get to interact.

00:46.366 --> 00:49.041
I've been teaching my parents.
