Class, today we shall be doing synonyms and antonyms.

00:06.320 --> 00:08.747
Does anyone know the meaning of antonyms?

00:09.203 --> 00:11.444
A word with the opposite meaning of another?

00:11.871 --> 00:12.739
Well done!

00:12.926 --> 00:16.034
Now Sid, can you also describe synonyms?

00:16.448 --> 00:19.308
A word you use when you can't spell the other word.
