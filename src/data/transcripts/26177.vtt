Say goodbye to webcam talks and prepare to communicate via hologram.

00:04.455 --> 00:08.889
Microsoft just unveiled a feature it calls "Holoportation" for the HoloLens.

00:09.013 --> 00:10.733
Sergio, let's just do a high five.

00:11.789 --> 00:14.896
It can send a 3D image of a person across the world...

00:14.981 --> 00:17.021
...to interact with someone else in real time.

00:18.907 --> 00:21.425
This is my apprentice, Darth Maul.

00:21.506 --> 00:26.116
It's basically something straight out of Star Wars, except it's not nearly as sleek.

00:26.779 --> 00:27.533
At least not yet.

00:27.708 --> 00:30.837
You have to have Microsoft's bulky augmented reality device...

00:30.957 --> 00:33.136
...strapped to your face to see the holograms.

00:33.269 --> 00:37.125
And you'll also need to be surrounded by special cameras to send an image of yourself.

00:37.583 --> 00:40.779
So, it's not exactly as simple as using a phone or a webcam.

00:40.985 --> 00:45.315
But Microsoft wants it to be as natural as face-to-face communication.

00:45.817 --> 00:48.877
So hey, maybe one day a bunch of holograms will be sitting with you...

00:48.967 --> 00:51.084
...during business meetings in the conference room.

00:51.669 --> 00:53.538
For Newsy, I'm Mikah Sargent.
