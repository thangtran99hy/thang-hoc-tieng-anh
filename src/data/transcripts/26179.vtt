00:08.832 --> 00:12.697

00:12.998 --> 00:16.112

00:16.300 --> 00:19.401
Cofounder Travis Kalanick is now focused on the road ahead.

00:19.599 --> 00:21.967
Kalanick told Charlie Rose of CBS News,...

00:22.227 --> 00:23.965
"We look at all of the cities around the world..."

00:24.034 --> 00:27.796
"...and we know that the transportation systems are not serving everybody's need."

00:28.028 --> 00:31.893
He continued, "Most successful entrepreneurs are not waiting for success..."

00:31.961 --> 00:33.366
"...and not waiting for progress."

00:33.457 --> 00:37.369
We're generally a little bit forward leaning when it comes to trying to make progress happen.
