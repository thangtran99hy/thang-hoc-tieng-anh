We've all imagined it:...

00:10.325 --> 00:12.529
...a world where robots do every job going.

00:13.282 --> 00:16.266
Well, imagine no more, because in a remote part of Japan,...

00:16.489 --> 00:19.940
...some sense of that future can be experienced at a robot hotel.

00:21.325 --> 00:22.915
Welcome to the Henn-na Hotel.

00:23.915 --> 00:25.913
Enjoy your comfortable stay.

00:26.586 --> 00:28.245
I will enjoy my comfortable stay.

00:28.425 --> 00:29.249
Thank you, robot.

00:31.202 --> 00:35.119
Japan already employs over a quarter of a million industrial robot workers,...

00:35.423 --> 00:39.102
...more than any other nation, in an effort to counter high labor costs.

00:39.774 --> 00:44.158
Big business would like to see that number go up to a million over the next 15 years.

00:44.805 --> 00:47.779
But as developers get better at building humanoid robots,...

00:48.113 --> 00:50.358
...bosses in the service and entertainment industries,...

00:50.686 --> 00:53.391
...are eyeing up ways to automate their workforce, too.
