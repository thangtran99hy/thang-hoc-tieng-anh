ï»¿Everybody has a little darkness in them.

00:03.595 --> 00:07.315

00:08.613 --> 00:09.550
I show it to them.

00:10.945 --> 00:14.311
And they hear it and they don't have to take it home.

00:18.949 --> 00:20.693
Country music, it's sincere.

00:21.381 --> 00:24.600
A man sings a sad song, he knows it's sad.
