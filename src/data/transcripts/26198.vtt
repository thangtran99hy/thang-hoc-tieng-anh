ï»¿Hold me close and hold me fast.

00:14.959 --> 00:20.624
This magic spell you cast, this is la vie en rose.

00:21.841 --> 00:25.485
When you kiss me, heaven sighs.

00:25.612 --> 00:31.311
And though I close my eyes, I see la vie en rose.

00:32.411 --> 00:35.679
When you press me to your heart,...

00:36.103 --> 00:41.633
...I'm in a world apart, a world where roses bloom.

00:42.990 --> 00:47.816
And when you speak, angels sing from above.

00:48.338 --> 00:54.023
Everyday words seem to turn into love songs.

00:55.458 --> 00:58.934
Give your heart and soul to me...

00:59.367 --> 01:05.747
...and life will always be la vie en rose.
