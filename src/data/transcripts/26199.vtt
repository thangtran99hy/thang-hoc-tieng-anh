This may look like a typical classroom:...

00:02.767 --> 00:06.560
...a room full of desks, students listening and taking notes...

00:07.050 --> 00:08.931
...and a teacher up front lecturing.

00:09.401 --> 00:12.793
But I assure you, this class is anything but typical.

00:13.270 --> 00:16.825
This is the BYU Beginning Scuba Diving class.

00:17.017 --> 00:20.077
The class is made possible through Dive Utah.

00:20.487 --> 00:24.017
It's a combination of a classroom environment, where the students learn...

00:24.167 --> 00:26.331
... fundamentals and safety procedures,...

00:26.859 --> 00:27.945
...and a pool environment,...

00:28.391 --> 00:31.803
...where the students go down under at the Provo Recreation Center...

00:32.232 --> 00:34.809
...and put into practice what they just learned.

00:35.185 --> 00:37.333
The good news about being scuba-certified?

00:37.823 --> 00:40.137
Once you get it, you're certified for life.
