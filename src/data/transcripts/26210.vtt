00:01.711 --> 00:03.255
ï»¿I remember wanting to stop.

00:05.743 --> 00:07.438
But I would push myself to keep going.

00:10.455 --> 00:11.531
It taught me discipline.

00:16.263 --> 00:17.479
And I would think about my dreams.

00:19.699 --> 00:22.789
I would think about the sacrifices my parents made for me.

00:29.175 --> 00:32.577
I would think about my little sister and how I was her hero.

00:35.099 --> 00:38.716
I would look at the beauty around me, the sunshine through the trees.

00:42.956 --> 00:43.714
I would keep breathing.
