Back when I was a child,...

00:18.418 --> 00:24.533
...before life removed all the innocence,...

00:25.170 --> 00:30.072
...my father would lift me high...

00:31.669 --> 00:35.727
...and dance with my mother and me...

00:36.101 --> 00:42.143
...and then, spin me around 'til I fell asleep.

00:44.239 --> 00:48.650
Then up the stairs he would carry me.

00:49.189 --> 00:55.374
And I knew for sure, I was loved.

00:56.673 --> 01:10.835
If I could get another chance, another walk, another dance with him,...

01:11.237 --> 01:16.333
...I'd play a song that would never ever end.

01:16.489 --> 01:19.725
How I'd love...

01:20.971 --> 01:29.593
...to dance with my father again.
