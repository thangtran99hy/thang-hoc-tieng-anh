Understanding coding is a weapon.

00:06.901 --> 00:09.216
It's like a superpower.

00:09.552 --> 00:10.787
It's better than a superpower.

Hi, I'm Karlie.

00:13.744 --> 00:17.561
I work in fashion, but I also consider myself a student.

00:18.242 --> 00:20.611
I'm fascinated by understanding how things work.

00:21.404 --> 00:23.627
I wanted to learn how the world of technology is built...

00:24.731 --> 00:27.217
...so I started to learn how to code in my spare time.

00:27.641 --> 00:34.128
If you can understand much less speak code, you can build anything.
