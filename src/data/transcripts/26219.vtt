00:03.168 --> 00:04.734
It's in our islands...

00:09.917 --> 00:11.229
...and our waters.

00:16.926 --> 00:18.796
It's in our artistry...

00:23.761 --> 00:25.382
...and across our land.

00:34.509 --> 00:36.035
It's in our history...

00:39.935 --> 00:41.309
...and our cities.

00:44.442 --> 00:47.178
It's in all our stones that stand.

00:48.830 --> 00:51.195
It's time to come and find it.

00:51.810 --> 00:54.051
It's time to come and feel it.

00:55.963 --> 00:59.071
Scotland, a spirit of its own.
