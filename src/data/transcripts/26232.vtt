You know that feeling when you make a casual 6 billion dollars in a day?

00:04.221 --> 00:05.454
Yeah, neither do we.

00:05.819 --> 00:08.203
But our Facebook friend Mark Zuckerberg does...

00:08.526 --> 00:12.183
...and it seems like the number 6 is a lucky one for Facebook's founder.

00:12.393 --> 00:15.066
After raking in 6 billion bucks on Thursday...

00:15.475 --> 00:18.310
...he rose to the sixth richest person in the world.

00:18.527 --> 00:23.317
And he has you, me, and the other 1.59 billion Facebook users logging on...

00:23.373 --> 00:24.903
...each month to thank for that.

00:25.100 --> 00:28.480
Facebook reported very strong results for the fourth quarter Wednesday.

00:28.719 --> 00:34.321
Ad sales were up 57% over the previous year's numbers in the last three months of 2015.

00:34.523 --> 00:37.651
Needless to say, that sent shares of the company soaring.

00:37.821 --> 00:42.587
According to CNBC, a Facebook share rose more than 15% in a day.

00:42.781 --> 00:47.051
Zuckerberg's current net worth now stands at about 47 billion dollars.
