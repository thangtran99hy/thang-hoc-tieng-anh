00:02.385 --> 00:03.446
The clever kid goat.

00:06.705 --> 00:08.543
There once lived a herd of goats.

00:09.119 --> 00:11.629
Some sheepdogs guarded them from the wolves...

00:11.809 --> 00:13.413
...that lived in the nearby forest.

00:14.202 --> 00:15.867
There was a tiny kid goat...

00:16.211 --> 00:20.681
...whose mother always warned him from wandering off alone into the forest.

00:22.745 --> 00:25.735
One day, the little goat was merely grazing...

00:25.875 --> 00:27.716
...and wandered away into the forest.

00:28.410 --> 00:32.566
A wicked wolf jumped out and said that he would eat him up.

00:34.535 --> 00:38.023
The scared kid goat thought of a plan to save himself.

00:38.687 --> 00:42.101
He requested the wolf to grant him one last wish.

00:42.711 --> 00:43.733
The wolf agreed.

00:45.603 --> 00:48.110
The kid goat asked the wolf to sing...

00:48.709 --> 00:52.540
...as he had heard people say that he had a lovely voice.

00:53.392 --> 00:57.247
The flattered wolf began to sing with great enthusiasm.

00:59.062 --> 01:02.662
The sheepdogs heard the noise and rushed into the forest.

01:03.349 --> 01:05.119
They nearly torn him to pieces...

01:05.537 --> 01:08.257
...and the wolf was lucky to escape with his life.

01:10.167 --> 01:12.702
The kid goat thanked them and apologized.

01:13.236 --> 01:15.826
He would always listen to his elders he said.
