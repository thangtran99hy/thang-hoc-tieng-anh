ï»¿My name is Luna Ruiz.

00:12.393 --> 00:15.603
I am a senior in high school, and I live in New York City.

00:15.943 --> 00:20.310
I was one of those kids that my mom would tell me, "don't touch the fire."

00:20.836 --> 00:22.681
I was obedient, I wouldn't touch the fire,...

00:22.737 --> 00:24.971
...but I'll probably throw stuff at it and make a bigger fire.

00:25.261 --> 00:27.470
I was always very adventurous and curious,...

00:28.140 --> 00:29.964
...and that's why I got into computer science...

00:30.179 --> 00:32.215
...'cause I was always curious about how things worked.

00:32.859 --> 00:37.121
Well, other than computer science, I'm into sports.

00:37.281 --> 00:38.963
I'm a serious athlete.

00:39.521 --> 00:42.779
I play volleyball, softball, and basketball.

00:43.091 --> 00:45.515
I'm really competitive, as you can see.
