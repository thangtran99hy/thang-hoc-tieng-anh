If you think living on Earth can be challenging,...

00:05.780 --> 00:08.322
...try spending a day on 55 Cancri e.

00:08.938 --> 00:11.955
The super-Earth is located about 40 light years from here...

00:12.351 --> 00:15.921
...and at least half of it is lightly covered in blazing hot lava.

00:16.393 --> 00:20.283
Temperatures can hover upwards of 4,400 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:20.784 --> 00:25.034
Part of the heat problem is due to the exoplanet's incredibly close proximity to its sun.

00:25.438 --> 00:29.108
The issue is particularly pronounced on one side of the celestial body,...

00:29.460 --> 00:32.159
...as astronomers believe it is tidally locked to the star,...

00:32.516 --> 00:34.135
...much like our moon is to Earth.

00:34.580 --> 00:38.905
That means 1/2 is forever exposed, while the other remains eternally dark.

00:39.388 --> 00:41.383
Unfortunately, that doesn't prevent the dark side...

00:41.476 --> 00:43.152
...from having temperature issues as well.

00:43.501 --> 00:47.637
Researchers estimate it's still a bit over 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit there.
