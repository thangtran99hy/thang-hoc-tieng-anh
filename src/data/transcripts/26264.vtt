...keeping inflation at a reasonable target rate of around 2%.

00:11.260 --> 00:13.352
It does this by fixing interest rates.

00:13.579 --> 00:16.525
These decisions have a direct impact on the credit policies...

00:16.629 --> 00:17.908
...of the banking institutions.

00:18.139 --> 00:21.115
For example, in the case of overheating eurozone economies,...

00:21.213 --> 00:24.152
...the ECB raises interest rates to cool inflation.

00:32.635 --> 00:36.330
...the ECB can cut interest rates to incite banks to issue clients...

00:36.417 --> 00:39.033
...with more credit thereby encouraging investment.
