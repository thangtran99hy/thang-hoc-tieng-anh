Today, we're going to do the egg in a bottle experiment.

00:04.285 --> 00:05.472
Here's what you'll need:...

00:05.963 --> 00:12.291
...a hard-boiled egg, a wide mouth bottle, a piece of paper, some matches or a lighter.

00:13.044 --> 00:15.291
First, peel your hard-boiled egg.

00:16.067 --> 00:18.876
Notice how the egg will not fall inside the bottle.

00:21.719 --> 00:25.981
Then, ask your parent to light your piece of paper, then put it inside the bottle.

00:26.735 --> 00:29.163
Then, quickly put your egg over top.

00:34.661 --> 00:38.822
When the paper is inside the bottle, the air inside heats up.

00:39.646 --> 00:44.487
When you put the egg over top, the flame goes out and the air starts to cool down.

00:45.486 --> 00:50.823
As the air inside contracts, the air outside pushes the egg into the bottle.

00:51.231 --> 00:53.843
And there you have it, the egg in a bottle.
