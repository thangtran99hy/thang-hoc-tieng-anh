Hi everyone! I'm Lang Lang and I was born in China.

00:04.150 --> 00:11.007
My first music experience was watching cartoons...

00:12.360 --> 00:17.927
...and one of my favorite characters was Tom the cat.

00:18.825 --> 00:22.275
Tom and Jerry but I've always liked Tom a little bit more...

00:22.746 --> 00:25.437
...because he's more silly so, somehow he's better.

00:26.741 --> 00:30.227
I started to play piano at the age of three.

00:32.262 --> 00:37.951
My first teacher was my father but he was not very good.

00:38.183 --> 00:45.227
After a year, I actually demanded to change to a better teacher.

00:45.761 --> 00:51.979
So when I was four, I started to really study, like kind of professionally.

00:52.502 --> 00:58.213
I practiced two hours a day or three hours.

00:58.943 --> 01:06.607
I made my first recital right after winning my first competition at the age of five.

01:08.923 --> 01:14.231
That recital really made me have a, kind of a dream...

01:14.410 --> 01:16.369
...to become a pianist...

01:16.885 --> 01:24.235
...because I thought being on stage feels pretty amazingly natural...

01:24.438 --> 01:33.603
...and I feel very satisfied and I really love to share music to the audience.
