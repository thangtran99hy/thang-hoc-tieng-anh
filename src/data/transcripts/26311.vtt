Your name is Bill Palmer.

00:03.953 --> 00:05.954
You are an intelligence officer from the CIA...

00:06.524 --> 00:07.960

00:10.492 --> 00:12.583
Jan Stroop, Dutch programmer.

00:12.826 --> 00:15.222

Where did you board him?

00:16.971 --> 00:18.514
That is all we need to know.

00:18.796 --> 00:19.910

00:42.131 --> 00:43.664
He loves you so much.

00:51.163 --> 00:52.513
There are so many lives at stake.

00:53.194 --> 00:54.141
They don't matter.

00:54.620 --> 00:55.370
They do to me.

00:56.975 --> 00:57.615
Criminal,...
