I've got some groovy hacks that put earth first.

00:03.164 --> 00:07.263
Let's get going and growing with my "Yes I Can" can planter.

00:07.746 --> 00:13.059
For this, you'll need some old clean cans, contact paper or sticky foam paper,...

00:13.233 --> 00:16.589
...stickers, soil, scissors, and plants.

00:17.205 --> 00:19.137
Remove the old label from the can.

00:26.507 --> 00:29.615
Cut the sticker paper to fit around the outside of the can.

00:32.002 --> 00:33.005
Stick it to the can.

00:48.099 --> 00:49.906
Now, decorate with stickers.

00:55.054 --> 00:57.171
Place soil and plants inside.

01:01.202 --> 01:02.514
Make another if you like.

01:03.975 --> 01:04.916
And you're done.

01:05.345 --> 01:08.188
The perfect planters for the perfect planet.
