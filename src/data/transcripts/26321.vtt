Hey, this is Jake with The Verge...

00:08.017 --> 00:10.403
...and we're gonna take a look at Magic Instruments' rhythm guitar.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.895
The company is basically trying to reinvent the guitar...

00:13.231 --> 00:15.328
...by removing all of the strings along the fretboard...

00:15.612 --> 00:16.711
...and replacing them with different buttons.

00:17.315 --> 00:19.086
And by pressing one of these buttons, you program the guitar...

00:19.165 --> 00:22.185
...to play a specific chord and then you just strum and play.

00:23.224 --> 00:26.459
The idea is that it's a lot easier to learn to just press different buttons...

00:26.755 --> 00:28.808
...than it is to figure out the specific fingerings...

00:29.098 --> 00:31.133
...of every individual chord you might wanna play.

00:31.425 --> 00:32.369
And it's definitely true.

00:32.869 --> 00:35.507
It is a lot easier to just pick this up and start strumming...

00:35.832 --> 00:36.991
...than it is in an acoustic guitar.

00:37.208 --> 00:38.399
But there's still some learning to do.

00:38.813 --> 00:41.425
You have to figure out which button to press to make which sound...

00:41.571 --> 00:43.602
...and you have to learn how to move your fingers along the fretboard,...

00:43.927 --> 00:45.701
...which is a lot like an acoustic guitar.

00:46.029 --> 00:47.861
To help you learn, Magic Instruments is launching an app...

00:47.989 --> 00:49.560
...that's basically like Guitar Hero.

00:49.945 --> 00:52.596
It'll lead you through popular songs button by button,...

00:52.951 --> 00:54.835
...telling you what to press to make which sound.

00:55.143 --> 00:57.238
The hope is that eventually you'll get pretty comfortable with it...

00:57.562 --> 00:59.528
...and be able to go off and start playing songs on your own.
