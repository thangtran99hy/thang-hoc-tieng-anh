Hi mum, my sentence was:...

00:03.115 --> 00:06.227
..."Thank you for giving me a platform to be open-minded,"...

00:06.522 --> 00:09.557
..."that you've helped me through very difficult decisions"...

00:09.621 --> 00:11.901
..."or encouraged me to make those decisions."

00:24.943 --> 00:28.496
The woman I am today comes from the strength...

00:29.052 --> 00:30.654
...that you have passed on to me.

00:31.437 --> 00:32.114
Well done, mum.

00:41.272 --> 00:47.167
You've just been completely unstoppable in your will and character.

00:47.575 --> 00:52.905
I hope if I can have 10% of that in my life, I'm gonna be okay.

00:53.190 --> 00:55.312
Thank you for giving me the ability to dream.

00:55.402 --> 00:57.777
You've always been a really good storyteller.

00:58.766 --> 01:01.971
Now, I just want to thank you for being so amazing.
