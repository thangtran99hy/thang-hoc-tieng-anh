Hi and welcome to PianoTV.

00:02.573 --> 00:06.911
I'm Allysia and today we're gonna do a Q & A, question and answer,...

00:07.897 --> 00:11.065
...where I talk about a question that I am asked a lot by beginners...

00:11.354 --> 00:14.982
...especially teenagers and adults who are kinda wondering...

00:15.050 --> 00:18.090
...how long does it take to learn how to play piano pretty good.

00:22.563 --> 00:27.070
The short answer is that, you're not gonna like it, it's a long time.

00:27.211 --> 00:28.407
It's gonna take you a long time.

00:28.715 --> 00:31.189
There's no way around it, you can't sugarcoat it,...

00:31.280 --> 00:35.820
...it's not like there's a super quick fix about it, there's really not.

00:36.269 --> 00:40.957
I would say that for the average person who practices like one hour a day,...

00:41.054 --> 00:45.705
...maybe half an hour, depending on how strong your practice sessions are,...

00:46.353 --> 00:49.855
...I would say it takes about a year or two to get to a level where you can play...

00:50.453 --> 00:53.747
...you know, you can be like, "Hey friends, check out this sweet pop song I learned."

00:54.322 --> 00:58.378
And that's not to say that you can't do good music beforehand...

00:58.438 --> 01:00.501
...that you know, in the year or two that you're learning...

01:00.569 --> 01:02.547
...that you're just learning crappy baby songs,...

01:03.029 --> 01:08.779
...but to get beyond the point where you're just learning basic techniques,...

01:08.897 --> 01:10.959
...it's going to take at least a year or two.

01:11.233 --> 01:14.045
And well beyond then, you're still gonna be learning basic techniques too.

01:14.144 --> 01:16.765
That never stops, it just gets a little more complex.
