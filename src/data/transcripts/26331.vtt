ï»¿The things that make virtual reality compelling...

00:03.608 --> 00:06.795
...have been with us for tens and hundreds of thousands of years.

00:07.625 --> 00:10.039
At its core, it's about storytelling.

00:10.809 --> 00:11.870
Everything along the way...

00:11.945 --> 00:14.643
...is a step towards trying to get more immersed in the experience,...

00:14.717 --> 00:15.859
...more immersed in the story.

00:17.125 --> 00:20.863
But we're still putting something between you and the world.

00:22.026 --> 00:27.172
What we really wanted to do was to make something feel real.

00:28.321 --> 00:33.157
And so, this is the first headset for actual reality.

00:48.865 --> 00:50.593
What's realer than real?

00:53.590 --> 00:54.455
Probably nothing...

00:57.359 --> 00:58.191
...or maybe something.

00:59.647 --> 01:00.175
I doubt it, though.

01:00.841 --> 01:01.333
I think we're done.
