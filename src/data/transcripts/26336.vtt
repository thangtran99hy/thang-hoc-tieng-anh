ï»¿What I'm tired of hearing about homework...

00:11.016 --> 00:16.251
...is like I have to do it so much that my mom and dad don't,...

00:18.050 --> 00:20.873
...like, sometimes they let me take a break but not really.

00:21.887 --> 00:23.839
And why do you think that is? Why is that?

00:24.373 --> 00:27.734
Because they want me to have a successful school year.

00:28.058 --> 00:30.951
That it's gonna be easy, that it's gonna be short.

00:31.430 --> 00:38.121
I mean, at least be honest to your students and just tell them the truth.

00:38.586 --> 00:40.456
It's like how you only have to read for 30 minutes...

00:40.583 --> 00:42.193
...and then sometimes it's actually an hour.

00:42.438 --> 00:46.817
For the first few days of school, we really didn't have homework.

00:47.392 --> 00:49.977
So, everyone was like, "Can we have homework?"

00:50.056 --> 00:50.927
"Can we have homework?"

00:51.023 --> 00:51.869
"Can we have homework?"

00:52.588 --> 00:53.706
And it's really annoying...

00:53.771 --> 00:56.393
...because today everyone was like, "Can we have homework?"...

00:56.556 --> 01:00.454
...and then the teacher is like, "It's Friday, there's no homework on Friday."
