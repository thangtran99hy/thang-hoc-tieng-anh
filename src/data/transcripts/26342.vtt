It's not hard to understand why a young boy like Benjamin Grosvenor...

00:06.652 --> 00:08.131
...might want to be a concert pianist.

00:08.537 --> 00:08.945
Who wouldn't?

00:11.925 --> 00:15.221
When a young pianist, like Benjamin Grosvenor for instance,...

00:15.317 --> 00:18.037
...here he is, he's at the beginning of this,...

00:18.351 --> 00:20.361
...it's a hugely competitive area.

00:20.968 --> 00:24.952
What is it that's going to make a concert pianist for today to stand out,...

00:25.072 --> 00:26.965
...particularly in this competitive environment?

00:28.015 --> 00:30.493
Oh, it's very difficult because there are thousands of people...

00:30.561 --> 00:32.953
...wanting to be a concert pianist.

00:33.747 --> 00:36.659
Obviously, natural virtuosity, the ability to learn...

00:36.721 --> 00:38.401
...and to conquer the instrument.

00:38.891 --> 00:42.765
All the obvious things: depth of interpretation, understanding,...

00:42.878 --> 00:46.077
...the ability to listen to oneself, to hear the piano while playing it...

00:46.569 --> 00:50.923
...and also charisma for the audience, having that quality...

00:50.988 --> 00:54.495
...that forces the listener to empathize with you while you're playing...

00:54.640 --> 00:57.565
...and to really force the public to listen.
