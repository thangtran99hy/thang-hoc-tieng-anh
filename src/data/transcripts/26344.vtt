00:04.985 --> 00:06.712
Yay! Time to brush.

00:06.926 --> 00:08.029
Why do we brush?

00:08.173 --> 00:11.291
We brush to remove plaque and stay clean.

00:11.574 --> 00:12.467
What's plaque?

00:12.857 --> 00:15.637
Plaque is yucky stuff that can stick to your teeth.

00:16.745 --> 00:20.114
Plaque is bad because it's full of nasty germs.

00:20.847 --> 00:25.324
These germs can hurt teeth by making little holes called cavities.

00:25.402 --> 00:26.056
No.

00:26.256 --> 00:28.713
Plaque and cavities make teeth weaker...

00:29.236 --> 00:33.023
...that's why it's super important to brush all the plaque off every day.
