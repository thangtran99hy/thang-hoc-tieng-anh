So, let's say you save your quarters in a piggy bank...

00:02.358 --> 00:03.767
...that you keep on a shelf in your room.

00:04.244 --> 00:06.538
But your mom keeps checking up on how much you're putting in...

00:06.613 --> 00:07.739
...and how much you're taking out.

00:07.955 --> 00:10.398
You don't like that, so what you need is a second piggy bank...

00:10.490 --> 00:11.675
...that you keep somewhere else.

00:11.952 --> 00:15.469
Your friend Johnny's mom is busy. She doesn't have time to check on piggy banks.

00:15.812 --> 00:17.439
You can bring a spare bank over there,...

00:17.532 --> 00:20.156
...then money can come and go without anyone being the wiser.

00:20.627 --> 00:22.848
But maybe Johnny's mom isn't really too busy.

00:23.141 --> 00:24.072
Maybe she's just lazy.

00:24.251 --> 00:27.533
Maybe she's deliberately telling the whole neighborhood that, for a small fee,...

00:27.775 --> 00:30.939
...she'll keep their piggy banks safe and not pay attention to what happens.

00:31.359 --> 00:34.867
That's what countries like Panama and the Cayman Islands and other tax havens do.

00:35.259 --> 00:37.776
They have very weak regulations in terms of watching...

00:37.884 --> 00:39.737
...when money comes in or out of bank accounts...

00:40.068 --> 00:44.321
...and they have rules that make it easy to form a corporation without disclosing who owns it.

00:44.617 --> 00:47.354
So basically, everyone gets to write a fake name on their piggy bank.

00:47.806 --> 00:50.515
There's a Panamanian law firm called Mossack Fonseca.

00:50.653 --> 00:53.792
They've got over 40 offices in dozens of countries around the world.

00:54.069 --> 00:56.867
They specialize in setting up this kind of special piggy banks.

00:56.999 --> 00:58.415
They're called "shell companies,"...

00:58.541 --> 01:00.845
...hollow vessels that don't conduct any business.

01:01.029 --> 01:04.248
They just own financial assets on behalf of their real owners.

01:04.441 --> 01:08.725
There's been this massive leak of over two terabytes worth of Mossack Fonseca documents...

01:09.038 --> 01:11.695
...to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

01:11.785 --> 01:14.813
And it sheds an unprecedented light on the world of shell companies.

01:15.332 --> 01:17.753
People can use these shell companies for legitimate reasons.

01:17.854 --> 01:19.352
Sometimes you just need privacy...

01:19.537 --> 01:23.635
...but they're also really useful for covering up scandalous or embarrassing information.
