00:00.136 --> 00:03.932
When the earth shakes, the ground moves and things start to fall,...

00:04.026 --> 00:08.434
...you'll ask yourself, "How prepared or unprepared are you?"

00:08.683 --> 00:12.348
Have you removed objects from over the bed and over your head,...

00:12.974 --> 00:15.620
...anchored your possessions securely to the wall?

00:16.024 --> 00:19.192
It won't be a pain and you're not doing it in vain.

00:19.825 --> 00:22.026
Are your emergency kits packed?

00:24.125 --> 00:25.667
What about your family, your friends?

00:25.754 --> 00:27.111
Do they know what to do,...

00:27.266 --> 00:29.321
...how to get in touch and where to meet?

00:30.537 --> 00:36.555
Do you know how to drop, cover and hold on, covering your head and neck?

00:40.498 --> 00:44.535
What if you're outside or in a car?

00:49.811 --> 00:52.733
After the shaking stops, look around.

00:53.314 --> 00:54.812
Figure out what to do.

00:55.381 --> 00:57.319
Stay away from damaged areas.

00:58.521 --> 00:59.629
Turn on a radio.

01:01.163 --> 01:02.247
Reach out for help,...

01:04.627 --> 01:07.171
...and if you're trapped, do not move about.

01:07.409 --> 01:10.455
Stay calm, only shout as a last resort.

01:11.098 --> 01:14.853
Once everything and everyone is safe, get prepared.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.182
An aftershock could be on its way.

01:17.535 --> 01:22.901
So, before the earth shakes, the ground moves and things start to fall, get prepared,...

01:23.009 --> 01:23.961
...make a plan,...

01:24.087 --> 01:25.275
...practice what you know...

01:25.382 --> 01:28.730
...because an earthquake can happen anytime, anywhere.

01:28.825 --> 01:29.921
You never know.
