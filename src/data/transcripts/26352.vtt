ï»¿Hi Chicken Little.

00:03.446 --> 00:04.329
Hi, Miss Booksy!

00:04.620 --> 00:05.209
What's happening?

00:05.661 --> 00:09.847
Well, our friend Amy has a question that I think you can help us with.

00:09.991 --> 00:14.319
She asks, "Why is the sky so far from the ground?"

00:14.821 --> 00:15.671
Good question.

00:15.913 --> 00:17.607
A lot of things need to fit in there.

00:18.103 --> 00:22.022
Planes, butterflies, kites even superheroes.

00:22.152 --> 00:25.413
We need all those amount of space so everyone and everything...

00:25.506 --> 00:27.927
...can fly around without a sky traffic jam.

00:28.430 --> 00:29.869
That would be super bad.

00:30.146 --> 00:30.629
Yikes!

00:31.465 --> 00:32.179
Hope that helps.

00:32.435 --> 00:32.777
See you!

00:34.107 --> 00:34.579
Thanks!

00:34.905 --> 00:35.429
Bye!
