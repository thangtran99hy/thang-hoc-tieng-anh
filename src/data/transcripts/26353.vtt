ï»¿Once upon a time, there was a gorilla with wings.

00:04.156 --> 00:07.145
One night, he flew out of the crazy zoo.

00:07.393 --> 00:10.088
The next morning he flew to the ice cream truck...

00:10.253 --> 00:13.340
...and bought a gigantic chocolate ice cream.

00:13.592 --> 00:16.362
After eating the ice cream, he went to the park.

00:16.703 --> 00:18.961
In the park, he saw a pink gorilla.

00:19.453 --> 00:22.537
The flying gorilla went to the pink gorilla and said,...

00:22.796 --> 00:23.999
..."Hi, do you giggle?"

00:24.277 --> 00:25.351
"Yes, of course."

00:25.735 --> 00:26.319
Knock, knock.

00:26.735 --> 00:27.337
Who's there?

00:27.619 --> 00:28.160
Gorilla.

00:28.529 --> 00:29.267
Gorilla, who?

00:29.671 --> 00:31.196
Gorilla me a hamburger.

00:33.007 --> 00:36.621
After two weeks, they both started to attend animal school.

00:36.879 --> 00:38.940
They were both in the same class.

00:39.125 --> 00:41.199
The gorillas were learning math.

00:41.417 --> 00:43.555
1, 2, 3.

00:44.801 --> 00:46.275
There are two bananas.

00:46.618 --> 00:50.535
Science, ELA and music.

00:50.687 --> 00:53.493
After two months, the gorillas graduated.

00:53.752 --> 00:58.303
During the graduation celebration, they did the gorilla stretch.

00:58.615 --> 01:01.308
Their professor said they were geniuses.

01:02.122 --> 01:06.152
Three months after, they fell in love then they got married.

01:06.569 --> 01:10.391
The husband tried to search and guess where his wife was.

01:11.657 --> 01:15.057
After the marriage, their genes were filled with love.

01:15.777 --> 01:16.813
The end.
