A mutual fund is a collective investment...

00:02.446 --> 00:05.282
...that pools together the money of a large number of investors...

00:05.347 --> 00:08.641
...to purchase a variety of securities like stocks or bonds.

00:09.020 --> 00:11.013
When you purchase a share in a mutual fund,...

00:11.259 --> 00:14.490
...you have a small stake of all investments included in that fund.

00:15.162 --> 00:18.085
Think of a mutual fund like a basket of investments.

00:18.334 --> 00:22.539
When you purchase a share in a mutual fund, you are buying one share of this basket,...

00:22.749 --> 00:27.033
...and therefore have a stake in one small fraction of all the investments in that fund.

00:28.067 --> 00:29.362
Suppose there's an investor...

00:29.454 --> 00:32.995
...who wants to invest some of his retirement portfolio in the stock market...

00:33.235 --> 00:35.908
...but he doesn't have time to analyze individual stocks...

00:35.997 --> 00:38.359
...and create a diversified stock portfolio.

00:38.723 --> 00:41.979
Instead, he decides that he'd rather purchase a mutual fund.

00:42.497 --> 00:45.481
This way, the investor can purchase a single investment...

00:45.581 --> 00:49.866
...which will in effect, be similar to purchasing an entire portfolio of stocks.
