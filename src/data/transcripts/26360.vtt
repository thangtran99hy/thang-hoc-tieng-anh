The iPhone is the result of years of innovation.

00:04.457 --> 00:07.435
But true innovation means considering what happens to a product...

00:08.109 --> 00:09.631
...at every stage of its life cycle.

00:12.041 --> 00:13.405
Meet Liam.

00:15.094 --> 00:18.066
When it's time, Liam deconstructs your iPhone.

00:19.891 --> 00:25.148
Parts are detected and removed and separated...

00:27.708 --> 00:32.150
...so the materials inside those parts can be repurposed.

00:34.119 --> 00:36.488
To rescue cobalt and lithium from the battery,...

00:37.624 --> 00:39.910
...separate the gold and copper in the camera,...

00:40.893 --> 00:43.763
...extract silver and platinum from the main logic board,...

00:45.486 --> 00:48.625
...so the materials in your iPhone can live on.

00:50.971 --> 00:56.525
Because in a world with limited resources, some things can't be replaced.
