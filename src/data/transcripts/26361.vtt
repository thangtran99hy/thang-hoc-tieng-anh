00:00.047 --> 00:03.273
ï»¿If you were a betting person, this wager probably wasn't for you.

00:03.367 --> 00:06.961
But it turns out, one of the greatest fairytale stories in all of sports...

00:07.279 --> 00:08.569
...came true May 2nd.

00:08.894 --> 00:11.516
Leicester City pulled off the near impossible,...

00:11.671 --> 00:14.747
...winning the British Premier League for the first time in the club's history...

00:15.121 --> 00:18.215
...going from 14th place to the top in just one year.

00:18.633 --> 00:21.080
With 5,000 to 1 odds at the start of the season,...

00:21.145 --> 00:23.707
...their improbable run wasn't expected by many...

00:23.787 --> 00:27.317
...especially since it's Leicester City's first top division championship...

00:27.705 --> 00:29.805
...for a club that was founded in 1884.

00:29.937 --> 00:33.220
Their previous best finish was second place in 1929.

00:33.604 --> 00:35.177
There's still two matches to be played...

00:35.256 --> 00:39.168
...which will likely become more of a victory tour for a set of unlikely champions.

00:39.623 --> 00:42.421
With the win, the Foxes also gain entrance into a new club,...

00:42.577 --> 00:46.003
...its first appearance in the UEFA Champions League group stage.

00:46.358 --> 00:48.158
