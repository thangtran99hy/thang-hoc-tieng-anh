What's the one line from the Harry Potter movies...

00:02.305 --> 00:03.415
...that still resonates with you?

00:04.156 --> 00:05.255
Of course it's happening in your head...

00:05.391 --> 00:07.329
...but why does that mean it's not real?

00:07.765 --> 00:08.592
Is this all real?

00:10.592 --> 00:11.981
Or is it just happening inside my head?

00:12.378 --> 00:14.748
Of course it's happening inside your head, Harry.

00:16.257 --> 00:18.635
Why should that mean that it's not real?

00:19.043 --> 00:19.605
I love that.

00:19.751 --> 00:23.477
I feel like that's a perfect one for anyone who is an artist...

00:23.541 --> 00:24.349
...or who is in the arts.

00:24.421 --> 00:27.287
Like, the fact that you can have things in your head...

00:27.343 --> 00:29.524
...and imagine them and if you believe in them hard enough,....

00:30.067 --> 00:31.641
...you can make a movie or a book or something.
