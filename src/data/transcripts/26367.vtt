Our world has become pretty much digital,...

00:03.117 --> 00:07.400
...and coding is really the logic of thinking about digital things.

00:11.224 --> 00:14.404
It is absolutely essential that the kids that are born today...

00:14.827 --> 00:17.564
...think that coding is just the most natural thing to do.

00:20.353 --> 00:23.061
The idea with the Root is that we have a single robot...

00:23.150 --> 00:24.722
...that has a really interesting behavior.

00:24.881 --> 00:26.951
It could move on whiteboards and it could draw...

00:28.054 --> 00:31.750
...but what makes it powerful is the different ways in which you could program it.

00:34.393 --> 00:36.571
A young kid understands consequences.

00:37.711 --> 00:39.784
If this, then this will happen.

00:40.289 --> 00:43.487
Now, they get to program the consequences to their robot.

00:43.591 --> 00:46.349
They can think about what a machine is able to do.

00:46.951 --> 00:47.955
What did they tell the robot...

00:48.039 --> 00:50.331
...and how did the robot misinterpret what they said?

00:51.236 --> 00:53.445
That part of our brain that's analytical...

00:53.908 --> 00:57.323
...and that thinks about processes is the one that Root is trying to engage.
