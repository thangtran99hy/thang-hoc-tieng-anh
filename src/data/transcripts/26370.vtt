If I should have a daughter, instead of "Mom,"...

00:07.007 --> 00:09.373
...she's gonna call me "Point B"...

00:10.359 --> 00:12.599
because that way she knows that no matter what happens,...

00:12.996 --> 00:14.989
...at least she can always find her way to me.

00:15.946 --> 00:19.211
And I'm gonna paint the solar systems on the backs of her hands...

00:19.418 --> 00:22.133
...so she has to learn the entire universe before she can say,...

00:22.223 --> 00:24.031
"Oh, I know that like the back of my hand."

00:24.845 --> 00:29.608
And she's gonna learn that this life will hit you hard in the face,...

00:29.813 --> 00:32.864
...wait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach.

00:33.047 --> 00:36.568
But getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs...

00:36.652 --> 00:38.615
...how much they like the taste of air.

00:39.077 --> 00:39.850
"Baby," I'll tell her,...

00:39.996 --> 00:43.621
"Remember, your mama is a worrier and your papa is a warrior..."

00:43.702 --> 00:46.348
"...and you are the girl with small hands and big eyes..."

00:46.429 --> 00:48.091
"...who never stops asking for more."

00:48.193 --> 00:51.583
Remember that good things come in threes and so do bad things.

00:52.309 --> 00:54.669
Always apologize when you've done something wrong,...

00:54.780 --> 00:59.003
...but don't you ever apologize for the way your eyes refuse to stop shining.

00:59.083 --> 01:01.942
Your voice is small, but don't ever stop singing.

01:02.105 --> 01:03.911
And when they finally hand you heartache,...

01:04.187 --> 01:06.599
...when they slip war and hatred under your door...

01:06.789 --> 01:10.937
...and offer you handouts on street corners of cynicism and defeat,...

01:11.086 --> 01:15.246
...you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother.
