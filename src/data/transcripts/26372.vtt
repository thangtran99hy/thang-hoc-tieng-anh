You gotta be smart to be number one in any business.

00:03.643 --> 00:06.255
But more importantly, you've got to play with your heart...

00:06.577 --> 00:08.508
...and with every fiber of your body.

00:10.933 --> 00:14.599
If you're lucky enough to find a guy with a lot of head and a lot of heart,...

00:14.839 --> 00:17.018
...he's never gonna come off the field second.

00:18.945 --> 00:22.242
And in truth, I've never known a man worth his salt...

00:22.349 --> 00:25.024
...who in the long run, deep down in his heart,...

00:25.565 --> 00:29.123
...didn't appreciate the grind, the discipline.

00:33.885 --> 00:37.241
But I firmly believe that any man's finest hour...

00:42.651 --> 00:45.511
...his greatest fulfillment to all he holds dear...

00:50.947 --> 00:54.859
...is the moment when he has worked his heart out in a good cause...

00:57.262 --> 01:00.308
...and lies exhausted on the field of battle....

01:06.737 --> 01:07.768
...victorious.

01:11.273 --> 01:14.009
Motherhood isn't always hearts and roses.

01:14.433 --> 01:18.036
Mother's day can be with a bouquet from Teleflora.
