Oh, we're in the middle of an interview, sir.

00:04.230 --> 00:05.771
Are you looking for reception?

00:05.947 --> 00:07.636
No, I'm here for the interview.

00:08.419 --> 00:09.217
You're what?

00:09.821 --> 00:10.347
I'm Kit.

00:11.989 --> 00:14.781
Oh yes, here you are, Kit Harington.

00:17.313 --> 00:18.217
That rings a bell.

00:20.390 --> 00:21.101
Game of Thrones?

00:21.491 --> 00:22.774
Ah, Frodo.

00:24.195 --> 00:25.741
What's Ian McKellen like then?

00:26.569 --> 00:30.355
I think you might have me mistaken for someone else.

00:30.617 --> 00:33.231
So, you're an actor then, what else have you been in?

00:34.081 --> 00:37.523
I was in Testament of Youth and the new movie, Spooks.

00:40.297 --> 00:43.517
I mean there's other stuff coming out in Hollywood and...

00:44.667 --> 00:46.421
Why do you want to be the face of Mencap?

00:46.983 --> 00:49.009
So, I want to be your ambassador...

00:49.156 --> 00:52.235
...because I want to help support people with a learning disability.

00:53.061 --> 00:56.743
I believe everyone deserves equal health care, equal education,...

00:57.255 --> 01:00.273
...equal access to work, the same chances as everyone else,...

01:00.345 --> 01:01.221
...to go out and have fun.
