My name is Masahiro Kikuno.

00:05.042 --> 00:06.645
I'm an independent watchmaker.

00:08.877 --> 00:12.029
Independent watchmakers make watches all by themselves.

00:12.794 --> 00:15.202
Usually, a company would have people assigned to design,...

00:15.331 --> 00:16.749
...create parts and build it,...

00:17.171 --> 00:20.603
...but independent watchmakers do all of that by themselves.

00:20.894 --> 00:24.899
If you need a practical watch, the world is never short or far more accurate...

00:25.141 --> 00:26.433
...in economical watches.

00:27.288 --> 00:30.427
But these timepieces are going to accompany you on a life's journey.

00:31.335 --> 00:33.826
They would stop if you do not wind them up for two days...

00:34.031 --> 00:35.197
...and they are imperfect.

00:36.014 --> 00:38.119
Humans need to look after them to make them work...

00:38.571 --> 00:41.063
...and I think that is the charm of these watches.
