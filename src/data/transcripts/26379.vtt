00:05.764 --> 00:09.663
Make sure that your dreams are yours.

00:09.885 --> 00:12.669
Make sure that you are not pursuing the dreams...

00:12.734 --> 00:14.375
...that somebody thinks you should have...

00:14.499 --> 00:17.504
...because dreams take a lot of work and a lot of support.

00:17.927 --> 00:22.232
You'll be more inspired to go after them if they're really really yours.

00:23.734 --> 00:26.635
The things that challenge you the most in life...

00:27.077 --> 00:29.429
...are probably gonna be the things that you look back on...

00:29.490 --> 00:32.734
...and are so grateful for because they made you better.

00:33.117 --> 00:35.759
So, the things that challenge you, try to be grateful for them...

00:35.881 --> 00:40.138
...and try to imagine how they have been put in your life specifically to help you.

00:40.385 --> 00:43.419
Take a deep breath, know that nothing is forever.

00:43.783 --> 00:45.369
If people are pressuring you to excel,...

00:45.539 --> 00:47.587
...it's probably because they really care about you.

00:48.055 --> 00:50.102
But just do your best. That's all that matters.

00:50.297 --> 00:52.153
That will lead you where you are supposed to go,...

00:52.264 --> 00:54.445
...if you really are doing your best.
