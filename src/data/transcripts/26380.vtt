ï»¿In such a climate, it's not enough to just give the people a megaphone.

00:07.476 --> 00:11.602
That's why your power and your responsibility to dig and to question...

00:12.363 --> 00:15.557
...and to counter distortions and untruths is more important than ever.

00:16.974 --> 00:19.229
Taking a stand on behalf of what is true...

00:20.005 --> 00:23.102
...does not require you shedding your objectivity.

00:24.703 --> 00:28.921
In fact, it is the essence of good journalism.

00:29.726 --> 00:33.628
It affirms the idea that the only way we can build consensus,...

00:33.730 --> 00:36.849
...the only way that we can move forward as a country,...

00:37.945 --> 00:40.527
...the only way we can help the world mend itself...

00:40.827 --> 00:45.723
...is by agreeing on a baseline of facts when it comes to the challenges...

00:45.939 --> 00:47.122
...that confront us all.

00:47.789 --> 00:51.408
So, this night is a testament to all of you who've devoted your lives...

00:51.508 --> 00:56.430
...to that idea, who push to shine a light on the truth every single day.
