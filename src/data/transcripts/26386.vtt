So, you went on talk shows in Korea?

00:02.581 --> 00:03.257
I did.

00:03.338 --> 00:04.206
I want to hear about that,...

00:04.300 --> 00:05.284
...because that's got to be crazy.

00:05.365 --> 00:08.245
Well yeah, I went on one of those legendary,...

00:08.339 --> 00:11.897
...crazy talk show, game show, slash stunt show.

00:12.555 --> 00:15.213
It was called Infinite Challenge.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.807
And it kind of reminded me of your show, in a way...

00:17.876 --> 00:19.523
...in that there's a little bit of talk,...

00:19.606 --> 00:21.935
...but there was also crazy stuff going down.

00:22.014 --> 00:22.827
Like what? What did you do?

00:22.888 --> 00:24.354
It got pretty cardiovascular.

00:26.744 --> 00:29.408
I had to take breaks; there was a lot of sweating.

00:29.471 --> 00:30.509
That was the chicken dance.

00:30.749 --> 00:32.015
That was me stuffing up.

00:32.183 --> 00:33.176
Yeah, the pillow fight.

00:33.720 --> 00:36.128
And I stuffed 14 marshmallows in my mouth.

00:36.851 --> 00:38.873
And we got crazy.

00:39.249 --> 00:40.934
In Korea man, they know how to party.
