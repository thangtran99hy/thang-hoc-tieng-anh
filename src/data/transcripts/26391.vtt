Some people live just for the fame.

00:15.027 --> 00:20.465

00:26.265 --> 00:37.316
Some people think that the physical things define what's within.

00:43.964 --> 00:48.887
...so full of the superficial.

00:48.973 --> 00:55.350
Some people want it all but I don't want nothing at all,...

00:55.594 --> 01:01.151

01:07.303 --> 01:14.827
...but everything means nothing if I ain't got you, yeah.
