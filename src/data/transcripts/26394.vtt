ï»¿What's going to the dentist like?

00:02.818 --> 00:04.685
It was actually a lot of fun.

00:05.041 --> 00:07.783
The first time I went to My Kid's Dentist, it was a short visit.

00:08.335 --> 00:11.590
I got to meet my dentist; she was super friendly.

00:11.959 --> 00:13.258
My mom and dad were there with me...

00:13.515 --> 00:14.712
...while the dentist looked in my mouth.

00:15.337 --> 00:18.517
She counted my teeth and checked to make sure that all my teeth...

00:18.611 --> 00:19.896
....were growing in the correct way.

00:20.651 --> 00:22.685
She also looked to see if I had any cavities.

00:24.343 --> 00:26.881
I saw all kinds of interesting things in the dentist's office.

00:27.269 --> 00:31.595
Things like the exam chair, it goes up and down...

00:31.655 --> 00:32.995
...so the dentist can see in your mouth.

00:33.579 --> 00:35.503
There's a special light that's really bright...

00:35.904 --> 00:37.631
...so the dentist can see all of your teeth.

00:37.989 --> 00:40.021
And there are special tools like a little mirror,...

00:41.325 --> 00:45.051
...and an x-ray machine that takes pictures of the insides of your teeth.

00:45.949 --> 00:48.946
There's even a little hose to spray water into your mouth.

00:54.494 --> 00:56.528
If I ever have any questions about my teeth...

00:57.010 --> 01:00.043
...or how to take care of them, I just ask my dentist.

01:00.441 --> 01:04.488
Your dentist is a friendly doctor who wants you to have healthy shiny teeth.
