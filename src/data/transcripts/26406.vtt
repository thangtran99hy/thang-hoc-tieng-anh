There are a lot of different kinds of folding techniques...

00:04.154 --> 00:05.428
...and a lot of different kinds of paper airplanes.

00:06.949 --> 00:08.387
There are planes that boomerang back.

00:09.051 --> 00:10.864
There are planes that are made to fly straight very far.

00:11.367 --> 00:13.292
There are planes that are made to stay in the air for a long time.

00:15.284 --> 00:17.609
Teachers kind of don't like kids to do paper airplanes.

00:17.683 --> 00:19.815
It has this bad boy, kind of renegade reputation.

00:20.387 --> 00:23.269
If they could discover that paper airplanes actually are science,...

00:23.331 --> 00:25.004
...that they're doing science and having fun doing it.

00:25.121 --> 00:26.424
I think that's an incredible breakthrough.

00:27.167 --> 00:28.658
Paper airplane throwing class. Yes!
