What if your car opened the doors not with a key but by scanning your face?

00:05.885 --> 00:09.562
That's just one example of new technology Toyota is working on now.

00:09.635 --> 00:11.581
It's part of a new partnership with Microsoft.

00:11.990 --> 00:13.742
A new group called Toyota Connected...

00:13.831 --> 00:16.342
...will focus on technology for tomorrow's vehicles.

00:16.739 --> 00:19.461
Say your hands are full with groceries or you're carrying luggage,...

00:19.763 --> 00:23.499
...the car's rear camera will scan your face, see that your hands are full...

00:23.759 --> 00:25.973
...and pop open the back hatch automatically.

00:26.268 --> 00:29.509
Let's just hope you don't have an evil twin that wants to borrow your car.

00:29.980 --> 00:33.111
The team is also looking at new ways to gather data on drivers...

00:33.211 --> 00:36.276
...with vehicles that report on hazards in the road ahead,...

00:36.605 --> 00:40.497
...and then that info can help warn other drivers on the same road...

00:40.814 --> 00:42.765
...or offer immediate rerouting.
