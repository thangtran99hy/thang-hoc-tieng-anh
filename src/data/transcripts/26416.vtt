When I talk about selling ideas, here's an example.

00:02.954 --> 00:04.169
There's a company called Better Works here.

00:04.261 --> 00:09.945
They sell an online service to help you reward your employees better...

00:10.265 --> 00:11.149
...or treat your employees better.

00:11.919 --> 00:16.409
For them, they sell the idea that you should treat your employees well.

00:17.053 --> 00:20.161
It might sound very silly but why should you treat your employees well,...

00:20.491 --> 00:22.521
...how can you treat your employees well and so on.

00:23.051 --> 00:26.741
They don't sell their product but when people learn about it,...

00:27.033 --> 00:29.857
...they learn from them, they learn tips, they get a lot of value there,...

00:29.938 --> 00:33.347
...and then they wanna actually subscribe or sign up with that company.

00:36.892 --> 00:39.669
If you were a writing coach,...

00:40.073 --> 00:42.333
...instead of selling people your writing services,...

00:42.547 --> 00:44.743
...you should sell them on the idea of why should they write,...

00:45.271 --> 00:46.327
...why should they write a book.

00:47.527 --> 00:51.218
So again, it's much more powerful if you sell ideas not stuff...

00:51.387 --> 00:54.288
...and you'll find that if you start sharing your best expertise...

00:54.452 --> 00:58.843
...for free out there whether it's through a blog, book, e-book,...

00:59.100 --> 01:02.326
...webinar, video, like these videos, Docstoc is doing it,

01:03.276 --> 01:04.842
...people will really respond to you.

01:04.942 --> 01:07.139
You are gonna get a lot more referrals, a lot more clients...

01:07.234 --> 01:09.029
And actually you're gonna feel a lot better...

01:09.187 --> 01:11.218
...because you're making a difference without selling people...

01:11.820 --> 01:13.178
...so educate, don't sell.
