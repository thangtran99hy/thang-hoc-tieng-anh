00:01.622 --> 00:03.815
I've tried to surround myself with people that push me,...

00:03.889 --> 00:09.817
...that motivate me, that keep me focused on the right things in this life.

00:10.133 --> 00:11.931
I have that on this stage right here.

00:11.997 --> 00:14.015
I have that in my family, and for that,...

00:14.089 --> 00:17.071
...I'm extremely blessed and extremely thankful for that.

00:18.675 --> 00:23.686
This is a crazy world, and to have that kind of guidance and that kind of motivation...

00:24.025 --> 00:27.009
...definitely has allowed me to do what I do on and off the court.

00:30.538 --> 00:32.849
That's my message, just to not be complacent.

00:33.599 --> 00:35.564
People might have thought I couldn't be back here on this stage,...

00:35.843 --> 00:37.908
...and I tried to push myself and tried to achieve...

00:37.977 --> 00:43.059
...what could not be achieved, and that's something...

00:43.173 --> 00:44.466
...I'm very, very proud of.

00:44.531 --> 00:46.569
So, thank you very much for this award.

00:46.671 --> 00:50.535
Thank you for supporting us every single day,...

00:50.844 --> 00:53.437
...and let's win a championship.
