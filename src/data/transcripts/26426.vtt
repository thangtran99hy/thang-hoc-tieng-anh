Bandai-Namco is coming up with a really cool VR experience...

00:03.926 --> 00:06.415
...that if you live in Tokyo, you will want to check out.

00:06.633 --> 00:11.475
They're opening up "VR Zone Project I Can" on April 15th,...

00:11.707 --> 00:16.091
...which is a virtual reality experience center designed for people to try out VR...

00:16.165 --> 00:17.910
...without spending an arm and a leg on it.

00:18.238 --> 00:21.386
The center will be located in Tokyo like I mentioned, and of course,...

00:21.636 --> 00:24.952
...and will feature six different simulations including fear of heights,...

00:25.034 --> 00:30.187
...where you rescue a cat that's stranded on a plank 650 feet above the ground...

00:30.611 --> 00:35.514
...while you are also balancing on a plank in real life to help immerse you in the demo...

00:35.755 --> 00:37.577
...and also scare you if you're afraid of heights.

00:37.909 --> 00:41.335
There's also a horror game, a driving game, a skiing sim,...

00:41.411 --> 00:44.457
