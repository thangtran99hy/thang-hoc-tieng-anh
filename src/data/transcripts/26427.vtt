As the global demand for white meat has grown in the US,...

00:03.323 --> 00:05.502
...so, in turn has the size of our chickens.

00:06.038 --> 00:08.744
In the last 50 years, the average weight of broiler chickens,...

00:09.098 --> 00:12.296
...those raised for meat versus eggs, has roughly doubled,...

00:12.527 --> 00:15.697
...while the time it takes for a chicken to mature has been cut in half.

00:17.567 --> 00:23.090
In 1965, a 3.5-pound bird took 63 days to get to market.

00:23.493 --> 00:28.316
In 2015, the average bird weighed 6.2 pounds in 48 days...

00:28.607 --> 00:31.963
...though many companies are growing chickens ten pounds or larger.

00:32.531 --> 00:34.715
But as the size of chickens has been increasing,...

00:34.983 --> 00:37.063
...so has the prevalence of muscle disorders.

00:37.292 --> 00:41.143
More chicken breast fillets are turning up laced with veins of fibrous meat...

00:41.489 --> 00:43.915
...the industry has dubbed, "woody breast."

00:44.694 --> 00:47.741
The condition doesn't present safety issues according to researchers,...

00:47.969 --> 00:50.086
...but it is affecting quality and taste.

00:50.587 --> 00:53.633
Scientists are still exploring the causes of the disorders,...

00:53.886 --> 00:58.480
...but many suspect that growing heavier birds in a shorter time is part of the problem.
