00:09.234 --> 00:11.145
Where did Russia come from?

00:11.342 --> 00:16.091
Why is it so big, and what are the differences between it and its neighbors?

00:16.698 --> 00:20.345
The answers lie in an epic story of seafaring warriors,...

00:20.827 --> 00:27.027
...nomadic invaders, and the rise and fall of a medieval state known as Kievan Rus.

00:28.039 --> 00:31.393
For several generations, the Kievan Rus flourished...

00:31.645 --> 00:33.540
...from its rich resources and trade.

00:34.045 --> 00:37.448
It's noblemen and noblewomen married prominent European rulers,...

00:37.813 --> 00:41.390
...while residents of some cities enjoyed great culture, literacy...

00:41.753 --> 00:44.605
...and even democratic freedoms uncommon for the time.

00:45.619 --> 00:52.094
Until 1237, when 35,000 mounted archers led by Batu Khan...

00:52.401 --> 00:55.413
...swept through those cities, sacking Kiev...

00:55.519 --> 00:58.236
...before continuing on to Hungary and Poland.

00:59.009 --> 01:01.643
The age of Kievan Rus had come to an end,...

01:01.949 --> 01:03.255
...its people now divided.

01:03.699 --> 01:06.209
In the east, which remained under Mongol rule,...

01:06.592 --> 01:09.031
...a remote trading post known as Moscow...

01:09.473 --> 01:12.003
...would grow to challenge the power of the khans,...

01:12.447 --> 01:14.615
...conquering parts of their fragmenting empire,...

01:15.175 --> 01:16.844
...and in many ways, succeeding it.

01:17.259 --> 01:20.139
As it absorbed other eastern Rus territories,...

01:20.437 --> 01:23.947
...it reclaimed the old name in its Greek form, "Russia."

01:24.424 --> 01:26.268
The former lands of Kievan Rus,...

01:26.671 --> 01:32.704
...populated by Slavs, ruled by Vikings, taught by Greeks, and split by Mongols...

01:33.163 --> 01:36.946
...would develop differences in society, culture and language...

01:37.277 --> 01:38.627
...that remain to the present day.
