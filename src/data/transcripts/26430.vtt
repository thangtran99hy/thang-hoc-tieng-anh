Race relations are better since I graduated, that's the truth.

00:07.831 --> 00:12.028
No, my election did not create a post-racial society.

00:12.095 --> 00:15.916
I don't know who was propagating that notion, that was not mine.

00:19.675 --> 00:22.368
But the election itself and the subsequent one,...

00:22.495 --> 00:25.424
...because the first one, folks might have made a mistake.

00:25.585 --> 00:28.591
The second one, they knew what they were getting.

00:31.233 --> 00:35.925
The election itself was just one indicator of how attitudes have changed.

00:38.547 --> 00:40.095
If you had to choose a time to be,...

00:40.148 --> 00:42.550
...in the words of Lorraine Hansberry,...

00:42.799 --> 00:47.675
..."young, gifted, and black" in America, you would choose right now.

00:53.627 --> 01:00.353
I tell you all this because it's important to note progress...

01:03.391 --> 01:07.100
...because to deny how far we've come would do a disservice...

01:07.713 --> 01:11.325
...to the cause of justice, to the legions of foot soldiers,...

01:12.959 --> 01:18.662
...to not only the incredibly accomplished individuals...

01:19.280 --> 01:20.213
...who have already been mentioned,...

01:20.375 --> 01:23.957
...but your mothers and your dads, and grandparents...

01:24.040 --> 01:29.106
...and great grandparents, who marched and toiled and suffered...

01:30.007 --> 01:33.975
...and overcame to make this day possible.

01:37.134 --> 01:42.589
I tell you this not to lull you into complacency, but to spur you into action...

01:43.975 --> 01:45.685
...because there's still so much more work to do,...

01:45.891 --> 01:47.630
...so many more miles to travel.

01:49.093 --> 01:54.416
And America needs you to gladly, happily take up that work.

01:57.969 --> 02:00.209
You all have some work to do.

02:02.617 --> 02:06.721
So, enjoy the party because you're going to be busy.
