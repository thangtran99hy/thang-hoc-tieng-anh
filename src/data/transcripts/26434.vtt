Early Europeans called it Ayers Rock, but its proper name is "Uluru,"...

00:04.668 --> 00:07.835
...the centerpiece of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park.

00:08.590 --> 00:12.534
For over 30,000 years, this area has been home to Anangu,...

00:12.969 --> 00:15.659
...the traditional aboriginal peoples who hold this land...

00:15.778 --> 00:17.566
...and its hidden water sources sacred.

00:18.213 --> 00:20.297
Make no mistake, this is a mystical place.

00:20.413 --> 00:22.203
You feel it as you draw nearer.

00:22.794 --> 00:24.244
And when you're right underneath the rock,...

00:24.404 --> 00:26.880
...it's bigger than anything that you can possibly imagine,...

00:27.023 --> 00:29.239
...and it surrounds you and envelops you.
