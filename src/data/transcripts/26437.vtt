00:03.533 --> 00:05.635
Germy the germ is very mean...

00:06.039 --> 00:08.508
...and so small, he can't be really seen.

00:08.943 --> 00:13.019
He's green and stinky and one bad dude.

00:13.665 --> 00:15.351
He even likes to hide in food.

00:16.887 --> 00:20.627
In the water and on the ground, Germy the germ is all around.

00:21.215 --> 00:23.087
He's in the air and on your skin.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.402
He'll make you sick if he gets in.

00:26.208 --> 00:29.785
An ache, an itch, a cold, a flu,...

00:30.323 --> 00:32.693
...Germy loves to cause trouble in you.

00:33.705 --> 00:36.118
If he gets in your body, he'll have a party...

00:36.496 --> 00:39.276
...and invite his germ friends Jim, Bob and Marty.

00:40.033 --> 00:42.640
Next thing you know, you'll be feeling rotten,...

00:43.083 --> 00:45.117
...all because of one thing forgotten.

00:45.655 --> 00:47.119
"What's that?" you ask.

00:47.675 --> 00:51.503
Is it really so easy to keep from feeling sick and queasy?

00:52.133 --> 00:54.019
Just wash your hands before you eat...

00:54.523 --> 00:57.177
...to keep Germy the germ from getting his treat.

00:58.076 --> 00:59.969
And wash your hand after you play,...

01:00.279 --> 01:02.316
...so Germy the germ will get washed away.
