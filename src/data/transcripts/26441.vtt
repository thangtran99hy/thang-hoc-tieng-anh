You've been gone too long, Alice.

00:13.924 --> 00:16.759
Friends can not be neglected, hurry.

00:23.765 --> 00:24.213
What's the matter?

00:24.654 --> 00:25.735
The Hatter is the matter.

00:25.917 --> 00:27.137
Hatter is my truest friend.

00:27.479 --> 00:28.813
If he is in need, I will help him.

00:29.059 --> 00:30.570
It will be a race against time.

00:32.525 --> 00:34.380
He is not someone you want as your enemy.

00:35.112 --> 00:35.868
Time is a he?

00:38.720 --> 00:41.722
Wonderland, your time is up.
