00:02.097 --> 00:02.413
ï»¿Morning.

00:04.118 --> 00:04.451
Evans.

00:05.310 --> 00:05.687
Downey.

00:07.891 --> 00:11.287
Is that the last donut with red, white, and blue sprinkles?

00:16.267 --> 00:19.354
What did I tell you would happen if you ate the last donut...

00:19.481 --> 00:20.556
...with red, white, and blue sprinkles?

00:20.736 --> 00:24.681
I'm a little foggy on it but I think it's something like raining down a hellfire.

00:26.033 --> 00:26.429
That's right.

00:28.276 --> 00:29.806
And here I am without an umbrella.

00:33.413 --> 00:34.514
I feel a storm brewing.

00:40.898 --> 00:44.019
Hold on, if we don't play that back I'm canceling the press tour.
