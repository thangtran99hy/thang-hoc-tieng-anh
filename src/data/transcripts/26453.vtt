00:02.073 --> 00:06.683
Krispy Kreme Donuts has agreed to be acquired by a unit of JAB Holding Company...

00:06.761 --> 00:09.035
...for about 1.35 billion dollars.

00:09.160 --> 00:13.649
It's a combination the two companies hope will be as natural as coffee and donuts.

00:14.412 --> 00:15.163
Sir, a dozen?

00:15.872 --> 00:16.332
Okay.

00:16.603 --> 00:21.515
JAB, a German private equity firm, will pay 21 dollars a share for the crispy confections...

00:21.639 --> 00:23.989
...in a deal that would take the donut maker private.

00:24.799 --> 00:28.151
JAB had been building a worldwide coffee empire in recent years.

00:28.595 --> 00:31.603
In addition to acquiring coffee machine maker Keurig Green Mountain...

00:31.719 --> 00:33.439
...for roughly 14 billion dollars,...

00:33.822 --> 00:37.018
...they also acquired Caribou Coffee and Peet's Coffee and Tea.

00:37.485 --> 00:41.123
That company already owned a majority stake in Intelligentsia Coffee...

00:41.236 --> 00:42.965
...and Portland's Stumptown Coffee.

00:43.593 --> 00:45.680
Krispy Kreme started out as a single store...

00:45.762 --> 00:48.603
...in Winston-Salem, North Carolina in 1937.

00:48.767 --> 00:50.271
It went public in 2000.

00:50.866 --> 00:55.725
Shares in the widely popular chain climbed to nearly 50 dollars apiece in 2003.

00:56.615 --> 00:59.670
But the company expanded so quickly that it landed in hot water...

00:59.807 --> 01:01.677
...as goods and stores became pervasive.
