00:02.689 --> 00:04.830
In an all too familiar occurrence,...

00:05.009 --> 00:06.993
...the loss of jobs due to automation...

00:07.097 --> 00:08.694
...is in the headlines again this week...

00:08.889 --> 00:10.169
...as the Milken Institute...

00:10.250 --> 00:13.347
...holds their Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California.

00:13.867 --> 00:15.481
The conference serves as a think tank...

00:15.565 --> 00:17.717
...aimed at solving the world's growing problems.

00:18.142 --> 00:19.673
This year, the theme centered around...

00:19.751 --> 00:22.157
...the growing presence of robots in our society.

00:22.683 --> 00:23.851
This is especially important...

00:23.935 --> 00:26.904
...as workers are increasingly being replaced by robots...

00:26.977 --> 00:30.523
...in factories, farming, retail, and even food service,...

00:30.866 --> 00:34.015
...creating a displaced workforce with an uncertain future.
