ï»¿Engage.

00:02.535 --> 00:04.433
Engage with the world in which you live.

00:05.872 --> 00:07.204
Nothing stayed the same.

00:09.651 --> 00:12.895
My strongest memory is walking into the meeting.

00:13.653 --> 00:17.451
And in my broken French I said, "Are there any problems?"

00:17.759 --> 00:24.385
And the response was unilaterally, unanimously from these women,...

00:27.177 --> 00:27.975
..."There's no water."

00:30.626 --> 00:34.395
I feel very strongly that we're all responsible for the state of our world.

00:35.337 --> 00:37.513
Every child deserves a fair start in life.

00:38.585 --> 00:42.644
And some people in the West, they get that for free.

00:43.190 --> 00:45.673
UNICEF are brave enough and bold enough...

00:46.538 --> 00:51.028
...to demand that every child has that opportunity.
