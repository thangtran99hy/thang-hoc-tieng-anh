00:02.133 --> 00:05.529
I have spent my whole life scared,...

00:08.595 --> 00:10.945
...frightened of things that could happen,...

00:12.071 --> 00:13.754
...might happen, might not happen.

00:14.561 --> 00:17.035
Fifty years, I spent like that.

00:18.751 --> 00:25.408
What I came to realize is that fear, that's the worst of it, that's the real enemy.

00:28.709 --> 00:32.529
Fear is not real.

00:35.593 --> 00:39.527
The only place that fear can exist is in our thoughts...

00:39.891 --> 00:44.861
...of our future that is a product of our imagination,...

00:45.944 --> 00:51.897
...causing us to fear things that do not, at present, and may not ever exist.

00:52.513 --> 00:54.051
Do not misunderstand me.

00:54.340 --> 00:59.524
Danger is very real, but fear is a choice.
