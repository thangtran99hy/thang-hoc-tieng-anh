ï»¿The lion and the mouse.

00:03.063 --> 00:04.701
Once when a lion was asleep,...

00:05.087 --> 00:07.755
...a little mouse began running up and down upon him.

00:08.537 --> 00:12.181
This soon wakened the lion, who placed his huge paw upon him,...

00:12.631 --> 00:14.959
...and opened his big jaws to swallow him.

00:15.788 --> 00:18.687
"Pardon O king!", cried the little mouse.

00:19.334 --> 00:22.663
"Forgive me this time; I shall never forget it..."

00:23.388 --> 00:28.309
"...who knows but what I may able to do you a turn some of these days."

00:28.879 --> 00:33.687
The lion was so tickled at the idea of the mouse being able to help him...

00:34.232 --> 00:36.945
...that he lifted up his paw and let him go.

00:37.585 --> 00:40.828
Some time after, the lion was caught in a trap...

00:41.523 --> 00:44.779
...and the hunters who desired to carry him alive to the king,...

00:45.303 --> 00:47.985
...tied him to a tree while they went in search...

00:48.057 --> 00:49.993
...of a wagon to carry him on.

00:50.825 --> 00:53.615
Just then, the little mouse happened to pass by...

00:54.189 --> 00:56.733
...and seeing the sad plight in which the lion was,...

00:57.209 --> 01:00.132
...went up to him and soon gnawed away the ropes...

01:00.201 --> 01:01.903
...that bound the king of the beast.

01:02.665 --> 01:05.523
"Was I not right?", said the little mouse.

01:06.743 --> 01:09.397
Little friends may prove great friends.
