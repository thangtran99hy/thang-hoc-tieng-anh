ï»¿We've all been there.

00:03.209 --> 00:05.809
You take a photo and you see the subject's in focus...

00:06.141 --> 00:08.515
...but the background, the whites are washed out...

00:08.573 --> 00:11.921
...and the darker areas are just one huge blob of darkness.

00:12.481 --> 00:14.783
This is where HDR mode comes in handy.

00:15.268 --> 00:17.188
But what exactly is HDR?

00:17.511 --> 00:18.721
Let's find out, shall we?

00:19.353 --> 00:22.413
HDR  or high dynamic range makes your lights lighter...

00:22.479 --> 00:24.338
...and your darks darker, in a good way.

00:24.789 --> 00:28.355
Usually how that happens is, photos are taken at different exposures...

00:28.437 --> 00:30.069
...from the very dark to very light...

00:30.347 --> 00:33.105
...and then they're merged into one beautiful HDR image.

00:33.603 --> 00:35.939
HDR technology is also used in video.

00:36.304 --> 00:39.142
In fact, Hollywood studios use HDR when shooting...

00:39.201 --> 00:40.333
...and mastering the footage.

00:40.760 --> 00:43.555
And to view the contents as intended by the creators,...

00:43.777 --> 00:47.038
...HDR-compatible TVs became somewhat of a necessity.

00:48.603 --> 00:50.692
From the birds in the clouds on a sunny day...

00:52.189 --> 00:54.094
...to little creatures hidden in the darkness,...

00:55.087 --> 00:57.925
...that's what HDR 1000 is all about.

00:58.769 --> 01:00.347
See the world as it should be seen.

01:01.180 --> 01:02.019
This is TV.

01:02.849 --> 01:04.571
Samsung SUHD TV.
