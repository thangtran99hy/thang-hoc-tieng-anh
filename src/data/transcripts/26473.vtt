Won't ever give up 'cause you're still somewhere out there.

00:04.883 --> 00:07.801
Nothing and no one's gonna keep us apart.

00:08.641 --> 00:11.589
Breaking it down but I'm still getting nowhere.

00:11.939 --> 00:15.375
Won't stop, hold on.

00:15.677 --> 00:19.011
Thunder and lightning, it's getting exciting,...

00:19.319 --> 00:22.893
...lights up the skyline to show where you are.

00:23.099 --> 00:26.402
My love is rising, the story's unwinding.

00:26.621 --> 00:30.629
Together we'll make it and reach for the stars.

00:30.937 --> 00:34.477
You're the only one, you're my only one.

00:34.711 --> 00:38.097
You're my life, every breath that I take.

00:38.359 --> 00:41.903
Unforgettable, so unbelievable,...

00:42.203 --> 00:45.651
...you're the only one, my only one.
