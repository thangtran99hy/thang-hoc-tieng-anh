00:00.141 --> 00:02.862
ï»¿Sorry, it sucks after graduation.

00:05.279 --> 00:06.248
It really does.

00:08.353 --> 00:11.293
I mean, I don't know, at least it did for me, but that's the only thing I know.

00:14.870 --> 00:16.601
You just get a bit derailed.

00:18.533 --> 00:20.281
But soon something starts to happen.

00:20.960 --> 00:21.468
Trust me.

00:22.909 --> 00:24.272
A rhythm sets in...

00:26.374 --> 00:28.537
...just like it did after your first few days here.

00:31.367 --> 00:36.647
Just try not to wait until like me, you're 29 before you find it.

00:38.995 --> 00:40.472
And if you are, that's fine too.

00:40.575 --> 00:41.975
Some of us never find it.

00:44.521 --> 00:45.517
But you will.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.587
I promise you.

00:50.763 --> 00:54.829
The world might say you are not allowed to yet.

00:57.761 --> 00:59.733
I waited a long time out in the world...

01:00.990 --> 01:04.161
...before I gave myself permission to fail.

01:06.669 --> 01:10.625
Please, don't even bother asking.

01:12.564 --> 01:15.163
Don't bother telling the world you are ready.

01:17.259 --> 01:17.795
Show it.

01:19.646 --> 01:20.039
Do it.

01:23.490 --> 01:24.877
What did Beckett say?

01:28.118 --> 01:32.558
"Ever tried, ever failed, no matter."

01:33.479 --> 01:38.217
"Try again, fail again, fail better."

01:41.892 --> 01:47.357
Bennington Class of 2012, the world is yours.

01:49.358 --> 01:53.691
Treat everyone kindly and light up the night.

01:54.905 --> 01:56.256
Thank you so much for having me here.
