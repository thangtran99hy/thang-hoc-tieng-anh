00:00.573 --> 00:03.495
Have you ever wondered how your dog experiences the world?

00:03.953 --> 00:05.068
Here's what she sees.

00:05.389 --> 00:06.888
Not terribly interesting.

00:07.457 --> 00:10.565
But what she smells, that's a totally different story.

00:11.055 --> 00:13.544
And it begins at her wonderfully developed nose.

00:14.621 --> 00:17.234
As your dog catches the first hints of fresh air,...

00:17.642 --> 00:22.917
...her nose's moist, spongy outside helps capture any scents the breeze carries.

00:23.541 --> 00:27.861
The ability to smell separately with each nostril, smelling in stereo,...

00:28.113 --> 00:30.693
...helps to determine the direction of the smell's source...

00:30.955 --> 00:33.258
...so that within the first few moments of sniffing,...

00:33.529 --> 00:37.071
...the dog starts to become aware of not just what kinds of things are out there...

00:37.329 --> 00:38.765
...but also where they're located.
