00:00.050 --> 00:01.780
If we had the power...

00:01.860 --> 00:04.215
...to bring our neighbors home from war,...

00:04.669 --> 00:06.799
...would have never missed a Christmas,...

00:07.015 --> 00:09.568
...no more ribbons on their doors.

00:09.685 --> 00:11.749
When you trust your television,...

00:11.897 --> 00:14.326
...what you get is what you got.

00:14.443 --> 00:17.225
'Cause when they own the information, oh...

00:17.326 --> 00:19.073
...they can bend it all they want.

00:19.218 --> 00:20.613
That's why we're waiting,...

00:21.855 --> 00:24.263
...waiting on the world to change.

00:24.353 --> 00:25.901
We keep on waiting,...

00:26.971 --> 00:29.783
...waiting on the world to change.

00:29.918 --> 00:31.845
It's not that we don't care,...

00:32.051 --> 00:34.373
...we just know that the fight ain't fair.

00:34.505 --> 00:35.673
That's why we're waiting,...

00:37.025 --> 00:40.127
...waiting on the world to change, come on.
