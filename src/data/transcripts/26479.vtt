I've heard it said...

00:06.507 --> 00:12.927
...that people come into our lives for a reason.

00:13.456 --> 00:16.799
Bringing something we must learn.

00:16.894 --> 00:18.989
And we are led...

00:19.955 --> 00:23.536
...to those who help us most to grow...

00:23.738 --> 00:27.117
...if we let them.

00:27.761 --> 00:31.810
And we help them in return.

00:31.916 --> 00:37.333
Well, I don't know if I believe that's true.

00:38.138 --> 00:41.491
But I know I'm who I am today...

00:41.596 --> 00:46.237
...because I knew you.

00:46.557 --> 00:49.419
Like a comet pulled from orbit...

00:49.749 --> 00:52.568
...as it passes a sun.

00:53.283 --> 00:56.397
Like a stream that meets a boulder...

00:57.225 --> 01:01.051
...halfway through the wood.

01:01.213 --> 01:06.669
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?

01:06.993 --> 01:10.995
But because I knew you...

01:14.341 --> 01:22.805
...I have been changed for good.
