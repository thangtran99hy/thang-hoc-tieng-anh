I would have no description for the perfect volleyball player...

00:04.593 --> 00:06.146
...'cause there is no such thing.

00:06.333 --> 00:09.207
Every great player has different qualities.

00:10.167 --> 00:13.265
Every part is being used in volleyball...

00:13.370 --> 00:16.864
...but the big things that volleyball players need...

00:17.071 --> 00:21.435
...are a strong shoulder for attacking and for spiking at the net,...

00:22.422 --> 00:25.128
...certainly strong legs to be able to jump...

00:25.433 --> 00:32.489
...and just as importantly, the ability to withstand the impact upon landing.

00:33.148 --> 00:37.162
So, it takes a lot of integrity all through the legs...

00:37.609 --> 00:40.506
...from ankles and feet all the way up to hips.

00:40.687 --> 00:45.875
And then of course, volleyball players need a really strong core,...

00:46.103 --> 00:48.946
...as in abdominal muscles, back muscles...

00:49.051 --> 00:53.880
...and just because our core is the foundation of everything we do.

00:54.067 --> 00:57.651
So, it takes the whole body to be a very good volleyball player.
