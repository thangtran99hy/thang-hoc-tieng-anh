ï»¿Badminton is a game played as singles...

00:02.755 --> 00:04.483
...where one person plays against one person...

00:04.960 --> 00:07.411
...or doubles where two people play against two people.

00:08.681 --> 00:11.131
The object of the game is for you or your team to win two sets...

00:11.233 --> 00:12.407
...faster than the opposing team.

00:13.485 --> 00:17.208
To win a set, you must score 21 points and be at least two points ahead.

00:17.606 --> 00:20.815
To start the game, the player must serve the shuttlecock below the waist.

00:21.583 --> 00:23.066
The shuttlecock must travel over the net...

00:23.345 --> 00:26.107
...and land in the areas defined for the serve to be legal.

00:27.233 --> 00:30.258
If the shuttlecock is hit onto the lines, this also counts as a point.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.202
The opponent will then try and return the shuttlecock...

00:33.561 --> 00:35.009
...and make you miss returning it back.

00:35.807 --> 00:37.935
This can go back and forth and is known as a rally.

00:38.683 --> 00:40.791
Remember, the aim of the game is to hit the shuttlecock...

00:40.969 --> 00:42.036
...onto your opponents floor,...

00:42.408 --> 00:44.318
...and these are the areas you're aiming for.
