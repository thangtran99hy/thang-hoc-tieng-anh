Now, I'd like to say a couple of words about training drills.

00:07.151 --> 00:13.285
One of the most common forms of training drills is the multi-feed shuttle drill,...

00:13.481 --> 00:16.906
...in which the coach holds a bunch of shuttles in one arm...

00:17.435 --> 00:20.721
...and he uses the other arm to throw the shuttle across the net...

00:21.040 --> 00:23.405
...and the student obviously has to try to retrieve it,...

00:23.865 --> 00:26.409
...all the while making sure that the student returns...

00:26.536 --> 00:29.909
...to the center of the court or his base after he hits it.

00:30.301 --> 00:33.346
Jeffrey is gonna show you how to hit the shuttles.

00:42.174 --> 00:45.941
One important thing to know is that the coach can vary the speed...

00:46.123 --> 00:49.215
...at which he's throwing depending on the level of the student.

00:49.735 --> 00:54.204
And he can also vary the direction in which he throws a shuttle.
