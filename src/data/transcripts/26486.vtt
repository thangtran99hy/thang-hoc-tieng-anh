00:03.808 --> 00:06.706
In 1790, Comte Mede de Sivrac...

00:06.801 --> 00:10.577
...invented the world's first ever non-animal-powered vehicle.

00:11.013 --> 00:12.979
It was called the "Celerifere."

00:14.567 --> 00:15.924
By the mid-1800s,...

00:16.006 --> 00:20.191
...the bicycle had gained steering capabilities, rubber tires and pedals.

00:20.841 --> 00:23.111
The next step was to eliminate the manpower.

00:23.437 --> 00:29.274
And in 1869, French bicycle manufacturer Pierre Michaux added pressurized steam,...

00:29.645 --> 00:32.272
...getting the rider up to ten miles per hour.

00:33.841 --> 00:37.222
The Industrial World were shifting from steam to combustion.

00:37.846 --> 00:41.563
And so, the race to power up the motorcycle had taken off.

00:43.408 --> 00:46.189
Almost a century after its bicycle ancestor,...

00:46.517 --> 00:51.101
...the motorcycle was powered up with a v-twin engine from Gottlieb Daimler,...

00:51.391 --> 00:57.345
...who later went on to join forces with Karl Benz to start Mercedes-Benz.
