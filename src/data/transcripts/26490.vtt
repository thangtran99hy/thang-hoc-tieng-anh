The company's international business is losing money hand over fist...

00:04.293 --> 00:07.589
...and Netflix faces many obstacles in new markets like India.

00:08.473 --> 00:11.711
There's competition from Amazon, local web video companies,...

00:12.153 --> 00:14.015
...and not everyone has access to the internet.

00:15.494 --> 00:18.059
It has been a bad idea to underestimate Netflix.

00:18.501 --> 00:22.639
The company's market value is 14 times what it was three and a half years ago.

00:23.354 --> 00:25.301
But the combination of tough sledding abroad...

00:25.407 --> 00:28.611
...and slowing growth domestically is a worrying trend.
