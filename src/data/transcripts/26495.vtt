00:08.454 --> 00:12.429
There are places I remember...

00:13.245 --> 00:18.705
...all my life, though some have changed.

00:18.921 --> 00:23.329
Some forever not for better,...

00:24.047 --> 00:29.533
...some have gone and some remain.

00:29.811 --> 00:35.259
All these places have their moments...

00:35.754 --> 00:40.349
...with lovers and friends, I still can recall.

00:40.519 --> 00:45.547
Some are dead and some are living.

00:46.263 --> 00:52.095
In my life, I've loved them all.
