00:00.737 --> 00:03.473
When you get to space, because you're in a zero-g environment,...

00:03.692 --> 00:05.747
...some really funky things happen to your body.

00:09.131 --> 00:10.258
I grew an inch.

00:10.804 --> 00:14.421
Right now I'm 5'11, but in space, I was six foot tall.

00:17.483 --> 00:21.025
On the ground, gravity compresses your spine.

00:21.202 --> 00:23.691
It pulls you down, the force vector going down.

00:24.013 --> 00:27.503
In space, without gravity pulling your spine down,...

00:27.623 --> 00:31.075
...every vertebra has a chance to move up,...

00:31.188 --> 00:33.667
...which gives you your extra inch of height.

00:37.197 --> 00:38.419
For some people in space,...

00:38.507 --> 00:42.168
...your intracranial pressure changes with pushes on your eyeball...

00:42.259 --> 00:46.380
...and that changes its shape, therefore requiring you to wear glasses in space.

00:46.460 --> 00:47.459
So, it affects your vision.

00:47.688 --> 00:50.459
So, we keep different prescriptions of glasses on board...

00:50.539 --> 00:52.699
...just in case someone's vision changes.

00:53.032 --> 00:56.883
Any changes in our bodies and anything that happens in space,...

00:57.225 --> 01:00.767
...it's worth it for the spirit of exploration.
