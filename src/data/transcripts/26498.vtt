Today, I'm gonna show you a quick and easy way...

00:04.494 --> 00:06.710
...to make these delicious bacon pancakes.

00:07.423 --> 00:11.371
Start by putting 200 grams of self-raising flour into a mixing bowl.

00:11.835 --> 00:15.776
Then add a tablespoon of sugar, a teaspoon of baking powder...

00:17.036 --> 00:17.860
...and a pinch of salt.

00:19.809 --> 00:20.572
Break in an egg.

00:23.325 --> 00:25.625
Then use a whisk to start mixing it all together.

00:27.923 --> 00:30.497
Slowly add 350 milliliters of milk.

00:33.138 --> 00:34.441
And give it a good mix.

00:35.561 --> 00:38.905
When you're done, it should be nice and smooth and look like this.

00:40.610 --> 00:42.623
If you like, you can take an empty sauce bottle...

00:44.077 --> 00:45.114
...and pour in the batter.

00:46.725 --> 00:48.723
You can store it in a fridge for another day.

00:50.099 --> 00:52.639
And just give it a good shake before you come to use it again.

00:54.443 --> 00:58.804
Next, we're gonna warm up some oil in a pan and cook a ration of bacon.

01:03.189 --> 01:06.287
When it's cooked on both sides, take your batter...

01:06.502 --> 01:08.534
...and pour out a pancake around the bacon.

01:09.773 --> 01:11.519
I'm also squirting some over the top.

01:13.369 --> 01:18.431
Cook the pancake on both sides and it's ready to serve.
