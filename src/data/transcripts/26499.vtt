00:07.025 --> 00:09.451
In the biblical story of the Tower of Babel,...

00:09.641 --> 00:12.264
...all of humanity once spoke a single language...

00:12.373 --> 00:16.223
...until they suddenly split into many groups unable to understand each other.

00:17.042 --> 00:20.168
We don't really know if such an original language ever existed,...

00:20.453 --> 00:23.561
...but we do know that the thousands of languages existing today...

00:23.687 --> 00:26.052
...can be traced back to a much smaller number.

00:26.763 --> 00:28.436
So, how did we end up with so many?

00:29.333 --> 00:33.157
In the early days of human migration, the world was much less populated.

00:33.788 --> 00:38.135
Groups of people that shared a single language and culture often split into smaller tribes,...

00:38.439 --> 00:41.309
...going separate ways in search of fresh game and fertile land.

00:42.052 --> 00:44.207
As they migrated and settled in new places,...

00:44.387 --> 00:47.805
...they became isolated from one another and developed in different ways.

00:48.289 --> 00:51.397
Centuries of living in different conditions, eating different food...

00:51.554 --> 00:54.455
...and encountering different neighbors turned similar dialects...

00:54.543 --> 00:58.528
...with varied pronunciation and vocabulary into radically different languages,...

00:58.811 --> 01:02.229
...continuing to divide as populations grew and spread out further.

01:03.141 --> 01:06.377
Like genealogists, modern linguists try to map this process...

01:06.463 --> 01:09.366
...by tracing multiple languages back as far as they can...

01:09.459 --> 01:11.854
...to their common ancestor or protolanguage.

01:12.655 --> 01:16.382
A group of all languages related in this way is called a "language family,"...

01:16.675 --> 01:19.264
...which can contain many branches and subfamilies.

01:20.365 --> 01:23.166
We may never be able to determine how language came about...

01:23.279 --> 01:26.649
...or whether all human languages did in fact have a common ancestor,...

01:26.848 --> 01:28.887
...scattered through the babel of migration.

01:29.319 --> 01:32.086
But the next time you hear a foreign language, pay attention.

01:32.246 --> 01:34.094
It may not be as foreign as you think.
