00:00.535 --> 00:01.463
You go out to dinner.

00:02.077 --> 00:02.929
People don't agree.

00:03.047 --> 00:04.244
You like this, I like that.

00:04.353 --> 00:08.144
You kind of ascribe that to me like maybe I'm not sophisticated,...

00:08.238 --> 00:12.218
...or I have some moral problems that I don't understand good food.

00:12.723 --> 00:16.169
But what people don't understand is we actually perceive things differently.

00:16.460 --> 00:20.171
We all look differently and that has to do in part with how we're born,...

00:20.775 --> 00:23.277
...and it has in part with what we do, with what we have.

00:23.799 --> 00:27.237
Hair short, hair long and it's just the same for sense of taste.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.673
They're inborn differences in genotype,...

00:30.114 --> 00:32.962
...so there's proteins that sense the sugars on our tongue...

00:33.096 --> 00:34.573
...that send a message to the brain.

00:34.962 --> 00:36.212
And some people have protein,...

00:36.303 --> 00:39.542
...there's not as much of those proteins where they're misshapen.

00:39.762 --> 00:42.871
And those people don't actually perceive as much sweet from sugar.

00:43.817 --> 00:46.464
Okay, so we got our four people and they're having dinner.

00:46.863 --> 00:50.302
So they look their taste profile, genetic profile.

00:50.391 --> 00:51.741
We could see these different patterns.
