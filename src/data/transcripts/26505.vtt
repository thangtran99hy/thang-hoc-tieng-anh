Kevin Durant was nominated for the season-long NBA Cares Community Assist Award...

00:04.531 --> 00:09.081
...presented by Kaiser Permanente for his impact on the lives of homeless youth...

00:09.183 --> 00:12.528
...and his generosity with local families in Oklahoma City.

00:12.643 --> 00:14.542
The organization does such a great job...

00:15.048 --> 00:18.197
...of making sure we're so tied in with the community...

00:18.389 --> 00:21.882
...and it's on us to be the players and the people that we are...

00:22.442 --> 00:23.390
...to give them a good example.

00:24.924 --> 00:26.565
It's amazing how we do things like this.

00:26.851 --> 00:28.320
It impacts so many kids' lives.

00:28.419 --> 00:30.039
I hope they remember it for a long time.
