Okay, activities, getting ready to go out.

00:05.758 --> 00:08.843
Oh my god I love this song, used to listen to this in middle school.

00:12.370 --> 00:15.677
Hey, don't write yourself off yet.

00:16.988 --> 00:22.399
It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on.

00:23.129 --> 00:27.565
Just do your best, do everything you can...

00:29.007 --> 00:33.507
...and don't you worry what their bitter hearts are gonna say.

00:35.466 --> 00:40.047
It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of the ride.

00:40.276 --> 00:42.964
Everything, everything will be just fine.

00:43.230 --> 00:46.716
Everything, everything will be alright, alright.

00:47.306 --> 00:51.839
It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of the ride.

00:52.138 --> 00:54.862
Everything, everything will be just fine.

00:55.071 --> 00:57.901
Everything, everything will be alright.
