00:10.637 --> 00:16.675
I found myself dreaming in silver and gold,...

00:17.112 --> 00:23.121
...like a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows.

00:23.713 --> 00:29.798
We were walking on moonlight and I pulled you close.

00:30.093 --> 00:36.011
Split second and you disappeared and then I was all alone.

00:36.083 --> 00:39.369
I woke up in tears with you by my side.

00:39.558 --> 00:43.775
A breath of relief and I realized.

00:44.945 --> 00:48.025
No, we're not promised tomorrow.

00:48.137 --> 00:54.219
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you.

00:55.082 --> 01:01.311
I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye.

01:01.419 --> 01:07.091
Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted...

01:07.919 --> 01:14.361
...'cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time.

01:14.493 --> 01:20.007
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you.

01:21.330 --> 01:28.431
I'm gonna hold you like I'm gonna lose you, babe.
