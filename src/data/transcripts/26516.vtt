00:02.154 --> 00:03.675
Tom Brand had it all.

00:04.437 --> 00:05.847
He earned billions.

00:06.325 --> 00:08.711
Traveled the world on luxury yachts.

00:09.015 --> 00:12.201
And owned homes in seven different time zones.

00:12.823 --> 00:15.014
He built an empire from scratch.

00:15.718 --> 00:19.793
Thousands called him the most powerful man in the world...

00:20.488 --> 00:25.621
...and now they call him Mr. Fuzzy Pants.

00:26.445 --> 00:29.998
You're gonna be stuck inside this cat until you make things right.

00:34.111 --> 00:35.690
You're the best gift I ever got.

00:36.436 --> 00:37.074
Just drown me.
