00:13.288 --> 00:14.066
ï»¿I am committed.

00:16.889 --> 00:18.169
I am always learning.

00:20.033 --> 00:21.137
Always pushing.

00:25.717 --> 00:28.662
I'm running but not for my life.

00:29.925 --> 00:31.106
I'm a football field.

00:32.173 --> 00:33.198
Not a battlefield.

00:34.759 --> 00:35.589
I am a mother.

00:36.697 --> 00:37.230
A father.

00:38.177 --> 00:39.335
I am two jobs.

00:40.684 --> 00:41.493
I am jumping.

00:42.835 --> 00:43.235
Shooting.

00:44.466 --> 00:45.072
Swimming.

00:45.889 --> 00:47.174
Towards a new world.

01:05.455 --> 01:06.464
I am not alone.

01:11.364 --> 01:13.335
I'm a room full of friends.

01:14.832 --> 01:16.525
A crowd full of cheers.

01:17.543 --> 01:19.147
I am full of wonder.

01:21.108 --> 01:21.751
I am you.

01:22.869 --> 01:26.614
And together, we can change the world.
