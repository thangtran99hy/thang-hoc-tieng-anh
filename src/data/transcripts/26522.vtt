00:00.075 --> 00:01.763
I can tell you exactly what happened at Friendster.

00:01.880 --> 00:02.883
It was bad management.

00:03.185 --> 00:04.683
It wasn't platform shift.

00:04.881 --> 00:07.721
It was a bad management team that couldn't keep their servers running.

00:07.811 --> 00:11.231
They couldn't maintain simple things like the integrity of their database.

00:11.307 --> 00:12.711
People's messages were getting corrupted.

00:12.790 --> 00:15.368
The log in times, the load times for every page were going up...

00:15.635 --> 00:19.177
...and that created an opening in the marketplace where Myspace was able to enter.

00:19.782 --> 00:23.235
Myspace never would have existed if Friendster had been a properly managed company.

00:23.633 --> 00:26.794
And I was close to that because most of my friends are investors.

00:26.879 --> 00:28.331
I was adviser to the CEO.

00:28.631 --> 00:31.514
We were all screaming "the sky is falling" and nobody was doing anything about it.

00:31.595 --> 00:34.208
That's a classic case of where a company just blew it.

00:35.445 --> 00:37.687
And Myspace is another case where a company just blew it.

00:37.990 --> 00:39.861
Facebook had no chance to win.

00:39.955 --> 00:41.363
We should not have won the market.

00:41.461 --> 00:43.835
The network effects at Myspace were so powerful.

00:44.025 --> 00:49.056
The only reason we won was because of the gross incompetence of Myspace systematically...

00:49.141 --> 00:50.392
...over a period of many years.

00:52.993 --> 00:54.553
Did I just say that publicly?
