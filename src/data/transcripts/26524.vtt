Last year's class of 2015 was sent off into the world...

00:02.834 --> 00:05.007
...as the most indebted class in history,...

00:05.146 --> 00:08.843
...owing more than an average of a whopping $35,000.

00:09.131 --> 00:09.660
And they're not alone.

00:10.057 --> 00:12.758
Seventy-one percent of college kids today are taking out student loans...

00:12.841 --> 00:17.271
...for an undergraduate degree, which now costs more than $100,000 on average.

00:17.677 --> 00:20.014
They're joining the 40 million people in this country...

00:20.125 --> 00:21.829
...that are burdened with student debt.

00:22.310 --> 00:25.995
And with wages stagnant, that means it's a lot harder to settle down,...

00:26.073 --> 00:28.885
...buy a house to start a family or save for retirement.

00:29.355 --> 00:32.493
More and more people are pushing these things further and further back...

00:32.723 --> 00:36.089
...because they're still paying off their tuition 21 years after graduating.

00:36.389 --> 00:39.565
Maybe that's why 43% of folks with government student loans...

00:39.701 --> 00:41.092
...aren't making their payments.

00:41.316 --> 00:46.886
In 2015, the average state was spending 20% less per student than in 2007...

00:47.046 --> 00:48.563
...before the financial crisis.

00:49.122 --> 00:52.301
That means universities are raising tuition fees to make up the difference.

00:52.420 --> 00:54.615
Altogether, students who went to college in the US...

00:54.722 --> 00:57.017
...owe 845 billion dollars.

00:57.270 --> 00:59.317
And it's a lucrative business for the federal government,...

00:59.418 --> 01:01.028
...which owns most of that debt.

01:01.183 --> 01:03.731
But does getting an education have to be this expensive?

01:04.157 --> 01:06.697
