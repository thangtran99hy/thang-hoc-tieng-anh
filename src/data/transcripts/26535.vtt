Let's talk cork tacks.

00:01.785 --> 00:05.921
This is an awesome, decorative way to pin things directly onto your wall.

00:06.019 --> 00:09.115
Simply grab a cork, hollow out about half an inch with a knife,...

00:09.268 --> 00:11.716
...drop in some hot glue and place the tack inside.

00:11.909 --> 00:13.354
Pin up all of your favorite items.

00:13.459 --> 00:14.661
Time for some games.

00:14.807 --> 00:16.949
Want a nice way to kill some time with your guests?

00:17.102 --> 00:18.541
How about cork-tac-toe?

00:18.772 --> 00:21.411
Simply grab a paper plate and draw a big hashtag.

00:21.670 --> 00:24.968
Now, cut up ten pieces of cork at about an eighth of an inch each.

00:25.146 --> 00:27.149
Draw five x's and five circles.

00:27.302 --> 00:29.840
Boom! Hours of fun for your devious hands.

00:29.959 --> 00:31.953
Now, how about some awesome fridge magnets?

00:32.068 --> 00:35.718
Simply cut some corks in half and hot glue simple magnets to the back.

00:35.827 --> 00:38.215
You can typically pick those up at any hardware store.

00:38.419 --> 00:40.962
Now, when you place this on the fridge, you can stand out from the crowd...

00:41.033 --> 00:43.383
...and boast that you consumed far too much wine.
