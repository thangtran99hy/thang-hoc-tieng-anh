Seventy-one years ago, on a bright cloudless morning,...

00:10.374 --> 00:14.225
...death fell from the sky and the world was changed.

00:16.867 --> 00:22.761
A flash of light and a wall of fire destroyed a city...

00:24.806 --> 00:31.071
...and demonstrated that mankind possessed the means to destroy itself.

00:35.553 --> 00:40.271
Why do we come to this place, to Hiroshima?

00:42.942 --> 00:49.704
We come to ponder a terrible force unleashed in a not-so-distant past.

00:53.007 --> 00:54.257
We come to mourn the dead,...

00:55.901 --> 01:01.733
...including over 100,000 Japanese men, women and children,...

01:03.860 --> 01:10.002
...thousands of Koreans, a dozen Americans held prisoner.

01:14.547 --> 01:16.417
Their souls speak to us.

01:18.778 --> 01:20.581
They ask us to look inward,...

01:22.331 --> 01:27.421
...to take stock of who we are and what we might become.

01:31.535 --> 01:35.510
Those who died, they are like us.

01:41.523 --> 01:43.619
Ordinary people understand this, I think.

01:46.223 --> 01:48.489
They do not want more war.

01:50.574 --> 01:56.963
They would rather that the wonders of science be focused on improving life...

01:57.917 --> 01:59.230
...and not eliminating it.

02:02.697 --> 02:04.505
When the choices made by nations,...

02:05.197 --> 02:10.967
...when the choices made by leaders reflect this simple wisdom,...

02:13.232 --> 02:15.906
...then the lesson of Hiroshima is done.
