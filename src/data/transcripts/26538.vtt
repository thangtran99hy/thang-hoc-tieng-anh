00:00.872 --> 00:02.140
ï»¿Grilling season has arrived.

00:02.457 --> 00:04.588
Are you ready? If not, you're going to be.

00:04.983 --> 00:07.217
Here is a real party pleaser for your backyard gathering...

00:07.347 --> 00:10.077
...that makes you look like MacGyver and a true backyard chef.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.111
Go digging in your garage or basement for an old clay pot.

00:13.763 --> 00:16.251
Next, you're going to need some type of surface to cook on.

00:16.459 --> 00:18.883
I used this little grate I found in my scrap metal pile,...

00:19.306 --> 00:21.826
...but you could just as easily use any metal that'll hold some food.

00:22.281 --> 00:24.847
I trimmed around it with my scissors for a snug fit inside.

00:25.522 --> 00:27.339
You're going to want to carefully line the pot now...

00:27.428 --> 00:28.987
...and make sure to cover the hole at the bottom.

00:29.351 --> 00:31.601
So, bust out that tinfoil and cover it up.

00:32.100 --> 00:35.215
Get your charcoal and fill the pot up about two inches from the top.

00:35.610 --> 00:37.883
Now, light it and lay your grill top back on.

00:38.543 --> 00:41.895
You are going to want to give the charcoal about ten minutes to heat up and then it's go time.

00:42.267 --> 00:44.591
Toss down your favorite grillables and save the day...

00:44.726 --> 00:46.863
...with your ingenious improvised terracotta grill.

00:47.305 --> 00:49.053
Now, keep in mind you can control the heat levels...

00:49.158 --> 00:50.879
...by putting the top of the pot back on.

00:51.247 --> 00:54.405
Just leave a little room for air to get in there or it's going to go out on you.

00:55.469 --> 00:58.556
Looks delicious and clean up's a breeze; just toss out the foil.
