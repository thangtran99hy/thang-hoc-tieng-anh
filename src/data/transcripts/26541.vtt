The Tribeca Film Festival is currently underway in New York City.

00:09.865 --> 00:13.221
And while it's best known for premiering independent feature films and documentaries,...

00:13.489 --> 00:17.093
...the festival is also a showcase for virtual reality and interactive entertainment,...

00:17.287 --> 00:19.343
...particularly at its Storyscapes event.

00:20.888 --> 00:23.785
The British newspaper, The Guardian, meanwhile created 6x9.

00:23.983 --> 00:26.471
A project that takes you inside solitary confinement.

00:26.797 --> 00:27.863
Once you put on the glasses,...

00:28.030 --> 00:30.085
...you're in a prison cell for nearly ten minutes...

00:30.293 --> 00:32.929
...while interview subjects who've gone through solitary confinement...

00:33.135 --> 00:34.509
...tell you what it's actually like.

00:34.727 --> 00:37.693
The voices that you hear are people who were previously incarcerated.

00:37.789 --> 00:42.757
So, there are six men, one woman who were in solitary confinement in California or in New York.

00:42.867 --> 00:47.213
And two psychologists who have studied the impact on the brain...

00:48.295 --> 00:50.289
...when you are in solitary confinement.
