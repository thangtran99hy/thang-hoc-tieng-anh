One year and 13 days ago, I lost my husband Dave.

00:08.022 --> 00:10.881
One day, my friend Adam Grant, a psychologist,...

00:11.181 --> 00:14.599
...suggested that I think about how much worse things could be.

00:15.695 --> 00:17.839
This was completely counterintuitive to me.

00:18.284 --> 00:20.835
I would've thought that getting through something like death...

00:21.177 --> 00:24.223
...was about finding every positive thought I could.

00:25.039 --> 00:26.561
"Worse?" I said to him.

00:26.846 --> 00:30.326
"Are you crazy? How could things be worse?"

00:32.196 --> 00:34.480
He looked at me and said,...

00:35.125 --> 00:39.657
"Dave could've had that same cardiac arrhythmia driving your children."

00:45.602 --> 00:52.673
The minute he said it, I felt overwhelming gratitude that my children were alive...

00:53.114 --> 00:57.274
...and that gratitude overtook some of the grief.

00:58.382 --> 01:01.861
My hope for you is that you can find that gratitude,...

01:02.323 --> 01:05.089
...not just on the easy days like today,...

01:05.542 --> 01:08.340
...but on the hard days when you will need it.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.239
You are not born with a fixed amount of resilience.

01:12.587 --> 01:13.714
It's a muscle.

01:14.091 --> 01:17.880
You can build it up and then draw on it when you need it.

01:18.575 --> 01:22.983
And in that process, you figure out who you really are,...

01:23.471 --> 01:30.232
...and you just might become the very best version of yourself.
