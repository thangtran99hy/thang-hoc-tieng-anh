00:06.134 --> 00:11.100
When I was born, doctors said I had a condition that affected every part of me,

00:11.571 --> 00:13.615
from my body to my brain.

00:16.015 --> 00:19.579
When you're like me, people don't always give you a chance.

00:19.879 --> 00:21.817
They put me in a different school.

00:22.379 --> 00:24.248
They put me in a different team.

00:25.264 --> 00:27.381
They talked to me in a different way...

00:28.444 --> 00:31.399
...but I never wanted to be treated any differently.

00:33.735 --> 00:39.597
I wanted to be independent, so I learned to drive.

00:40.913 --> 00:46.497
I love sports, so I took part in any way I could.

00:48.861 --> 00:53.267
When my condition became so bad, I lost feeling in my legs.

00:55.601 --> 00:57.532
I learned to walk again.

00:59.657 --> 01:04.251
And when I wanted to work, I got a job.

01:04.914 --> 01:06.335
It's a struggle every day...

01:06.679 --> 01:11.149
...but I still get up because work makes me feel that I'm reaching my goals.

01:12.454 --> 01:14.076
I'm part of a team.

01:16.432 --> 01:19.231
And I get to give back to my family.

01:20.502 --> 01:25.034
My whole life people have been telling me I have a learning disability.

01:25.610 --> 01:29.832
I guess they're right because I have never learned how to give up.
