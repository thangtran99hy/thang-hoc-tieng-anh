When you're looking at that beautiful, dark night sky,...

00:06.587 --> 00:08.759
...what goes through my mind is the wonder of it.

00:10.395 --> 00:12.455
It's just so incredibly vast.

00:14.501 --> 00:17.655
I never lose interest in it because it's just so beautiful.

00:19.353 --> 00:23.903
I wanted others to enjoy the night sky as much as they could.

00:24.594 --> 00:27.039
The best way to do that is to build your own planetarium.

00:29.618 --> 00:33.809
This is the largest mechanically operated planetarium in the world.

00:35.214 --> 00:37.083
All the stars are hand-painted...

00:37.327 --> 00:41.132
...one dot at a time with glow-in-the-dark luminous paint.

00:42.484 --> 00:43.822
It took about five months.

00:45.131 --> 00:47.343
This is the only planetarium in the whole world...

00:47.801 --> 00:50.999
...that has the night sky as glow-in-the-dark paint.

00:52.823 --> 00:54.839
This is beyond normal,...

00:55.455 --> 00:59.408
...but some of us actually put our dream into reality and do it,...

01:01.469 --> 01:05.769
...and I took ordinary materials and I made something extraordinary out of them.
