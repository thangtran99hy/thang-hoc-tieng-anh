WEBVTT

00:02.277 --> 00:04.572
I led Overwatch for 20 years.

00:04.819 --> 00:06.465
People used to call me a hero.

00:07.172 --> 00:08.607
Those were the good old days.

00:09.246 --> 00:10.211
They didn't last.

00:12.147 --> 00:14.697
People decided they were better off without us.

00:15.064 --> 00:16.509
They even called us criminals!

00:16.616 --> 00:17.939
Why would you do this?

00:18.951 --> 00:21.207
They tore our family apart.

00:23.713 --> 00:27.468
The world is changing once again and it's time to pick a side.

00:28.355 --> 00:29.227
But look around!

00:29.945 --> 00:31.647
Someone has to do something!

00:32.577 --> 00:34.513
We have to do something!

00:36.868 --> 00:37.467
What are you looking at?

00:45.898 --> 00:47.520
Trying to crash another party, love?

00:51.730 --> 00:53.331
You don't get off that easy.

01:00.559 --> 01:02.503
We can make a difference again.

01:04.343 --> 01:05.997
The world needs us now...

01:06.383 --> 01:07.214
...more than ever!

01:10.174 --> 01:11.077
Are you with me?
