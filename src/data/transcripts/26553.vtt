Welcome to Plum Landing.

00:05.014 --> 00:06.706
Oliver takes out the trash.

00:09.569 --> 00:10.686
Awesome.

00:12.723 --> 00:14.981
This Plink let's you see everything.

00:18.333 --> 00:21.004
Hey, who put all that trash there?

00:21.648 --> 00:23.129
That's disgusting.

00:26.636 --> 00:30.053
Okay, bags and biceps let's do it.

00:35.677 --> 00:39.148
I mean what doofus would throw this stuff into a river.

00:39.627 --> 00:41.325
Isn't that your lunch bag?

00:43.670 --> 00:49.127
Ah yeah, but I didn't throw this in the river, I threw it in the trash.

00:49.297 --> 00:53.943
That's not for trash Ollie, that's an air vent it goes to the river.

01:00.513 --> 01:02.941
Aw man, I'm the doofus...

01:03.435 --> 01:06.419
...but still how did my stuff get all the way downstream?

01:07.305 --> 01:08.988
Water moves, remember?

01:09.473 --> 01:13.298
So, anything you drop up here will eventually land down there.

01:14.909 --> 01:19.713
Right! Okay, from now on, I'm gonna be careful where I throw stuff.
