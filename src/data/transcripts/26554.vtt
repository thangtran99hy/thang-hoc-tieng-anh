00:03.055 --> 00:05.119
ï»¿It's a glimpse into the center of the Earth.

00:05.600 --> 00:08.261
It's like listening to the heartbeat of the planet.

00:08.956 --> 00:13.399
The physiological effects of being inside the volcano are significant...

00:13.629 --> 00:17.275
...in that you have every force down there trying to kill you.

00:19.675 --> 00:21.358
All right, so let's use the drone...

00:22.007 --> 00:24.791
I wanted to share the Marum Crater...

00:25.191 --> 00:29.023
...that's located in the island nation of Vanuatu by bringing a team with me...

00:29.090 --> 00:31.262
...and documenting this place in a way that's never been seen.

00:32.433 --> 00:36.251
The drone that we used is called the Phantom 2 Vision Plus.

00:38.602 --> 00:43.034
We had also GoPros mounted onto these particular drones with gimbaled devices...

00:43.090 --> 00:47.109
...so that no matter how much they shook, the video remains stable.

00:52.283 --> 00:56.007
The greatest scientific value is just having videographic support...

00:56.110 --> 01:00.636
...that can be used in tandem with other research that's happening in the world.

01:01.415 --> 01:02.889
I really believe there's an opportunity...

01:02.969 --> 01:06.779
...to merge those worlds of exploration and tech and then coming back...

01:06.901 --> 01:11.373
...and reporting on all kinds of information that has not yet been discovered.
