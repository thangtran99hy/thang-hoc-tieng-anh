Fair trade aims to establish equitable conditions of trade and commerce...

00:05.591 --> 00:07.311
...between countries in the north and the south.

00:07.777 --> 00:09.833
The concept appeared after the Second World War,...

00:10.026 --> 00:14.125
...and received its first certification in 1988 in Mexico.

00:14.405 --> 00:17.855
A cooperative of small coffee producers of the state of Oaxaca...

00:18.186 --> 00:21.833
...partnered with the Dutch NGO to create the Max Havelaar label,...

00:22.067 --> 00:24.371
...named after a hero of a Dutch novel.

00:24.839 --> 00:25.961
The principle was simple:

00:26.316 --> 00:28.971
The NGO buys the coffee at a fixed price...

00:29.038 --> 00:32.205
...and the farmers, unaffected by the fluctuations of the market,...

00:32.467 --> 00:34.151
...can then live off their work.

00:34.705 --> 00:38.419
A part of the money is then used to finance schools and health centers.

00:38.832 --> 00:42.621
By eliminating middlemen, distribution costs are also reduced.

00:42.819 --> 00:47.437
The idea is also to supply good quality products while respecting the environment.

00:47.965 --> 00:50.701
To begin with, fair trade only dealt with a few products:...

00:50.862 --> 00:52.855
...coffee, bananas, tea and sugar.

00:53.613 --> 00:57.712
Today, there are fair trade clothes, sneakers and even a smartphone:

00:57.902 --> 01:00.453
in total, more than 30,000 products.

01:01.015 --> 01:04.928
Various businesses have also become interested in the idea of fair trade.

01:05.273 --> 01:10.548
In 2012, the sales of fair trade products were worth 4.8 billion euros...

01:10.835 --> 01:15.987
...with 1.3 million producers and workers benefiting in 70 countries.

01:16.403 --> 01:18.631
But the practice also attracts criticism:...

01:18.791 --> 01:21.345
...the lack of transparency of labels which keep multiplying,...

01:21.628 --> 01:26.407
...high prices or distributors who increase their margins on products that are in demand.
