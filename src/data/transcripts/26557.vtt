I love Steve Jobs.

00:05.502 --> 00:08.486
And you watch Steve Jobs put his black t-shirt on...

00:08.721 --> 00:09.758
...and get in front of those people...

00:09.851 --> 00:13.149
...and introduce the iPhone and the iPad and these iconic products.

00:13.240 --> 00:16.261
When you see the leader out there selling the product...

00:16.479 --> 00:18.627
...and selling the vision and selling the brand,...

00:18.807 --> 00:23.019
...it doesn't only inspire clients, it helps you articulate the vision.

00:23.135 --> 00:27.145
He believed that technology should seamlessly integrate into our lives...

00:27.411 --> 00:30.573
...and that we shouldn't have to change the way we live our lives to fit technology.

00:30.845 --> 00:32.549
Technology should fit how we live.

00:32.826 --> 00:35.067
This is the reason why simplicity mattered.

00:35.270 --> 00:36.915
This is the reason why design mattered.

00:37.008 --> 00:40.611
This thing that he believed was so important that it drove all of his decisions.

00:40.684 --> 00:42.183
It set their strategy.
