00:00.584 --> 00:03.930
Thirteen of the 23 players on the squad are World Cup winners...

00:04.078 --> 00:07.958
...including goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and star striker Thomas Muller.

00:08.711 --> 00:11.872
The team will also see the return of Jerome Boateng in defense...

00:12.259 --> 00:14.451
...and Arsenal's Mesut Ã–zil in midfield.

00:15.823 --> 00:18.222
Mario Gotze, who scored the World Cup winning goal,...

00:18.317 --> 00:20.261
...has struggled for form in Bayern Munich...

00:20.582 --> 00:23.008
...but seems to thrive on the international stage.

00:27.358 --> 00:30.342
It's a great moment for me, coming back after a long injury,...

00:30.497 --> 00:33.405
...scoring a goal playing in the national team in Munich.

00:36.375 --> 00:37.777
It's nothing but good things.

00:41.213 --> 00:42.889
It will be nothing but great things...

00:42.965 --> 00:45.401
...should Super Mario replicate his World Cup form...

00:45.658 --> 00:47.473
...all the way to the European Final.

00:47.968 --> 00:49.512
But first, the group stages.

00:50.084 --> 00:53.284
Germany are up against Ukraine, Northern Ireland and Poland.
