00:00.050 --> 00:01.669
Here's a mistake a lot of people make.

00:02.133 --> 00:04.801
They think body image is physical.

00:05.185 --> 00:06.846
Most of it is mental.

00:06.939 --> 00:10.635
It's all about what you think about yourself and how you feel about yourself.

00:10.903 --> 00:14.134
My mantra would be, "You are more than enough."

00:14.637 --> 00:16.442
Step one, you're gonna need paper.

00:16.592 --> 00:18.343
Number two, you're gonna need markers.

00:18.958 --> 00:21.145
And number three, most importantly,...

00:21.230 --> 00:24.067
...you're gonna need some mantras that you're gonna say every day.

00:24.426 --> 00:25.603
Mantras are personal.

00:25.957 --> 00:27.950
No one has to understand them but you.

00:28.570 --> 00:32.015
My mantras came from a class but yours can just come from you.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.913
Really, it's about making yourself feel good.

00:37.959 --> 00:42.233
Say your mantras every day at least twice before you leave the house.

00:42.551 --> 00:44.523
I want to get those good thoughts in there,...

00:44.605 --> 00:48.166
...thoughts that you think about yourself before you go out into the world...

00:48.246 --> 00:50.023
...and have everyone else impacting you.

00:50.391 --> 00:52.730
So, take those phrases, write them down,...

00:52.877 --> 00:55.489
...put them up on your bathroom mirror and say them to yourself.

00:55.725 --> 00:59.434
I know it sounds weird, but do it because you will thank me later.

00:59.659 --> 01:01.621
Believe me, it makes a huge difference.
