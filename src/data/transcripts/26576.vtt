They're cute, they're lovable and, judging by the 26 billion views...

00:17.291 --> 00:22.521
...of over two million YouTube videos of them pouncing, bouncing, climbing,...

00:22.685 --> 00:26.563
...cramming, stalking, clawing, chattering, and purring,...

00:26.985 --> 00:30.849
...one thing is certain: cats are very entertaining.

00:31.894 --> 00:34.239
These somewhat strange feline behaviors,...

00:34.574 --> 00:39.185
...both amusing and baffling, leave many of us asking, "Why do cats do that?"

00:40.698 --> 00:42.375
They developed through time as both...

00:42.438 --> 00:45.214
...solitary predators that hunted and killed to eat...

00:45.627 --> 00:48.944
...and stealthy prey that hid and escaped to survive.

00:49.983 --> 00:52.830
So, cats today retain many of the same instincts...

00:53.071 --> 00:56.475
...that allowed them to thrive in the wild for millions of years.

00:57.127 --> 01:00.160
This explains some of their seemingly strange behaviors.

01:00.940 --> 01:03.306
To them, our homes are their jungles.

01:03.863 --> 01:07.375
But if this is the case, in our own cat's eyes, who are we?

01:08.167 --> 01:11.226
Big, dumb, hairless cats competing with them for resources,...

01:11.904 --> 01:15.246
...terribly stupid predators they're able to outsmart every day,...

01:15.971 --> 01:18.161
...or maybe, they think we're the prey.
