We live in Hollywood but...

00:01.550 --> 00:03.876
...we also travel around the world a lot when we work.

00:03.969 --> 00:07.159
And my kids have been to refugee camps and they've also spent,...

00:07.243 --> 00:12.377
...we just spent four months in Cambodia working and living there.

00:12.613 --> 00:16.173
They've had the good fortune to be able to live in all parts of the world...

00:16.274 --> 00:18.254
...and they have started to travel with me into the field.

00:19.715 --> 00:22.644
And they're very interested, I've never pushed them...

00:22.703 --> 00:24.897
...because I never wanna like, make them do, and I waited...

00:24.960 --> 00:27.952
...and they asked and so far Pax and Shiloh have been really wanting to go.

00:29.553 --> 00:31.059
And they read a lot about it, so they wanna know.

00:31.115 --> 00:33.787
So, when mommy goes somewhere, they kind of read a little bit about it.

00:34.439 --> 00:37.351
And then often, which is quite cute, my little ones give me like,...

00:38.337 --> 00:41.931
...Vivienne will give me a blanket and tell me I have to find someone to give it to.

00:41.997 --> 00:44.821
When I brought Shiloh with me to Lebanon, she brought a,...

00:45.189 --> 00:49.737
...this kind of circus stick and for all my talking and for all my everything,...

00:49.801 --> 00:52.034
...all the kids just wanted to go out and play with the circus stick.

00:52.097 --> 00:54.625
So, it's true what they say about, you know,...

00:55.003 --> 00:57.883
..."An hour of play is worth more than years of conversation."

00:58.061 --> 01:01.049
Kids connect much faster than us adults.
