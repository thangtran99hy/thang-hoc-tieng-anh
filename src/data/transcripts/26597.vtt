It all started with this one young girl who sent me this video...

00:13.389 --> 00:16.071
...of herself singing one of my choral pieces.

00:16.273 --> 00:22.393
And I was struck so hard by the beauty, the intimacy of it, the sweetness of it.

00:22.957 --> 00:26.549
And I thought, well, it would be amazing if we can get a hundred people to do this...

00:26.907 --> 00:29.401
...and cut it altogether and make a virtual choir.

00:30.215 --> 00:34.281
So, I then went into a studio and I conducted in total silence.

00:34.725 --> 00:37.641
I can only hear it in my head, and I loaded all of that up to YouTube,...

00:38.270 --> 00:40.195
...and I sent out a call to singers across the world,...

00:40.803 --> 00:43.076
...and the response was totally overwhelming.

00:43.234 --> 00:46.327
We had 185 singers from 12 different countries.

00:47.139 --> 00:49.688
It was all about connecting and about somehow connecting...

00:49.744 --> 00:57.224
...with these people over the world and these individuals, alone, together.

00:57.726 --> 01:01.115
For me, singing together and making music together...

01:01.408 --> 01:05.497
...is a fundamental human experience.

01:06.375 --> 01:10.235
And I love the idea that technology can bring people together...

01:10.353 --> 01:12.343
...from all over the world and still sort of participate...

01:12.479 --> 01:15.487
...in this transcending experience.
