00:03.049 --> 00:06.001
He was, for most of the last 40 years of his life,...

00:06.139 --> 00:08.735
...the most recognizable human being on the planet.

00:09.427 --> 00:13.032
And even when Parkinson's Disease slowed his step and his speech,...

00:13.101 --> 00:15.141
...he still reveled in that recognition.

00:16.982 --> 00:19.779
He loved people the way no other athlete in his time...

00:19.861 --> 00:22.002
...and few public figures loved people.

00:22.551 --> 00:24.136
He loved to sign autographs.

00:24.509 --> 00:27.703
He loved to pose for pictures with the famous and the unknown.

00:28.155 --> 00:32.448
He loved to perform his simple magic tricks for audiences small or large.

00:32.925 --> 00:34.970
He loved being Muhammad Ali.

00:37.231 --> 00:41.357
Ali spent most of his final years travelling as much as any human alive,...

00:41.732 --> 00:46.087
...most often for charities, preaching and practicing love.

00:46.457 --> 00:51.629
Still the most charismatic of all athletes, still lighting up every room he graced.

00:52.042 --> 00:55.438
Still, undisputedly, the Greatest.
