00:02.496 --> 00:05.455
The most meaningful art is able to be enjoyed and understood...

00:05.798 --> 00:06.973
...at every stage in life.

00:07.945 --> 00:10.693
With "Calvin and Hobbes", you're always discovering something new.

00:11.802 --> 00:12.688
Read them when you're six...

00:12.759 --> 00:15.793
...and fall in love with the colorful adventures of a boy and his tiger.

00:16.206 --> 00:18.621
But revisit them when you're 16 or 26...

00:18.886 --> 00:22.329
...and they take on an entirely different but equally impactful meaning.

00:23.447 --> 00:26.016
"Calvin and Hobbes" launched November 1985,...

00:26.163 --> 00:30.245
...written, drawn, colored and lettered by this man, Bill Watterson.

00:30.769 --> 00:32.656
Watterson was only 27 years old...

00:32.847 --> 00:34.913
...when "Calvin and Hobbes" was picked up for syndication.

00:35.127 --> 00:36.934
And he had gone through several rejected projects...

00:37.015 --> 00:38.920
...before finally landing on the one strip...

00:39.283 --> 00:42.031
...that would reshape the way people looked at newspaper comics.
