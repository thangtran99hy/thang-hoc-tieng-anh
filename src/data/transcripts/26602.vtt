00:04.459 --> 00:06.711
That's not a fair question. They're both awesome.

00:07.074 --> 00:09.712
Curry. We saw him in the last series. Kid's clutch.

00:10.191 --> 00:12.617
LeBron James, definitely. I feel like LeBron deserves it.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.644
I love the matchup. I think they're both great players...

00:15.003 --> 00:16.446
...but I think Steph's got more heart.

00:16.521 --> 00:22.339
LeBron is just an animal. He's like nine feet tall and extraordinarily powerful,...

00:22.477 --> 00:24.357
...so I feel that I have to go with LeBron.

00:24.516 --> 00:26.328
I think they call him "The King" or something.

00:26.501 --> 00:28.311
Curry all the way. He has all the talent.

00:28.371 --> 00:30.946
I think that makes him a perfect Warrior.

00:31.344 --> 00:32.239
LeBron James.

00:32.334 --> 00:32.907
Steph Curry.

00:33.136 --> 00:36.356
I just personally believe that the Warriors are overrated as an entire team...

00:36.443 --> 00:39.644
...and that they're gonna choke this year to a Cavs team that's fully healthy.

00:40.099 --> 00:43.721
No, Steph Curry is a freaking genius.

00:43.888 --> 00:44.399
Overrated.

00:44.453 --> 00:45.600
Two-time MVP.

00:45.973 --> 00:49.913
His three-pointers are phenomenal. Go Curry.

00:50.318 --> 00:53.988
So many people are so invested in Steph Curry that like,...

00:54.300 --> 00:57.638
...if he doesn't win, I will feel so bad about that.
