After World War II, food shortages plagued Japanese cities.

00:05.069 --> 00:08.899
So, the US supplied wheat flour and encouraged the Japanese to make bread.

00:09.326 --> 00:11.663
One man named Momofuku Ando...

00:12.173 --> 00:15.479
...didn't understand why his people would make bread instead of noodles.

00:15.747 --> 00:17.798
Something that was already part of their culture.

00:18.453 --> 00:20.965
Ando decided to take matters into his own hands...

00:21.024 --> 00:23.007
...and create a new ramen made to last.

00:23.955 --> 00:27.210
He spent a year trying to figure out how to preserve the noodles.

00:28.091 --> 00:31.008
He needed a nonperishable, tasty and easy recipe.

00:31.165 --> 00:34.562
But it was a challenge to maintain robust flavors and unique texture...

00:34.647 --> 00:36.239
...that most people were accustomed to.

00:37.521 --> 00:40.014
It wasn't until his wife was making dinner one night...

00:40.297 --> 00:43.583
...and he threw some noodles in a bowl of hot tempura oil...

00:43.881 --> 00:47.555
...that he realized flash frying the noodles was the answer he had been looking for.

00:48.001 --> 00:51.725
This method not only dehydrated them, it left small perforations...

00:51.805 --> 00:53.741
...that allowed the noodles to recook quickly.

00:55.015 --> 00:55.856
And there you have it.

00:56.058 --> 00:58.599
Instant ramen noodles became an instant success.

00:59.509 --> 01:02.023
So, the next time you heat up a cup of instant noodles,...

01:02.848 --> 01:05.643
...remember you're slurping down a little piece of history.
