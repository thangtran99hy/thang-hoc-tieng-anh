It may surprise you to know that attention is like a muscle,...

00:05.237 --> 00:06.317
...like a muscle in the arm,...

00:06.856 --> 00:11.081
...and that there are exercises, mental exercises that improve attention,...

00:11.203 --> 00:14.262
...that strengthen the brain circuitry for attention...

00:14.379 --> 00:18.248
...just like you'd go to the gym and you'd do some reps on a Cybex machine...

00:18.315 --> 00:19.675
...and get a stronger tricep.

00:19.946 --> 00:23.366
These exercises are very simple but very effective.

00:23.552 --> 00:28.271
The social emotional learning curricula have many that are developmentally appropriate...

00:28.355 --> 00:32.553
...so that you teach the same lesson in different ways as children's cognitive abilities...

00:33.066 --> 00:36.009
...expand with brain growth and as they go through the grades.

00:36.567 --> 00:39.501
One of the most effective is something called "The Stoplight."

00:39.892 --> 00:41.872
It's a poster on the wall of a classroom.

00:42.431 --> 00:44.920
It says, "When you're upset, remember the stoplight."

00:45.209 --> 00:48.869
Red light: stop, calm down, think before you act.

00:49.583 --> 00:52.893
Yellow light: think of a range of different things you could do now...

00:53.217 --> 00:54.823
...and what the outcome would be.

00:55.473 --> 00:57.880
Green light: pick the best one and try it out.

00:58.072 --> 00:59.281
It's a highly effective method.
