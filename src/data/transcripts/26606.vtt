There's a component in being a human being,...

00:03.137 --> 00:06.427
...an essential part of being a human being that's about being expressive,...

00:06.525 --> 00:08.153
...having fun and being able to move,...

00:08.459 --> 00:13.391
...and physical literacy kind of instills these fundamental components.

00:13.548 --> 00:16.910
Physical literacy is just like anything else, so numerical literacy,...

00:16.983 --> 00:20.806
...alphabetical literacy, so learning to do math, learning to speak...

00:20.981 --> 00:23.411
...it's just literacy in general, but physical literacy.

00:23.639 --> 00:28.882
It's breaking down big movements into fundamental movement skills.

00:29.226 --> 00:32.804
So, just like when you're learning how to read or write you learn the ABCs...

00:33.062 --> 00:35.885
...and when you're playing sports, whether those be traditional...

00:35.944 --> 00:39.055
...or nontraditional, you learn fundamental movement skills...

00:39.117 --> 00:42.463
...like skipping, jumping, hopping, running, things like that.

00:42.803 --> 00:44.495
It's about being able to reach for that top shelf,...

00:44.581 --> 00:46.413
...it's about being able to walk up and down the stairs.

00:46.773 --> 00:52.641
It's not just for specific people, specific genders, specific areas.

00:53.245 --> 00:59.838
Physical literacy has a place for everyone and can help you in any way, shape, or form.

00:59.949 --> 01:02.654
It doesn't matter whether you consider yourself an athlete or not.

01:03.001 --> 01:06.011
It's going to make a difference in your life one way or another.
