ï»¿My biggest problem with reading is I don't understand what I'm reading.

00:11.015 --> 00:14.393
It makes me feel like I'm dumb when I can't do what everybody else can do.

00:15.001 --> 00:17.817
She was spending too much time deciphering...

00:18.404 --> 00:21.113
...word by word versus understanding what she was reading,...

00:22.132 --> 00:26.009
...and in eight months, now she can read and understand a full paragraph.

00:26.370 --> 00:31.061
The SDSU reading program is providing a very beneficial resource...

00:31.133 --> 00:35.157
...to not only the City Heights community but the San Diego community.

00:35.384 --> 00:39.236
We assess each child and based upon the assessments,...

00:39.357 --> 00:43.995
...we design instruction that's entirely tailored to that child's need.

00:44.204 --> 00:44.981
It works.

00:45.279 --> 00:47.446
The students and the parents, they see results,...

00:47.799 --> 00:52.930
...huge gains in just a few months, and so for them, this is a godsend.

00:53.509 --> 00:55.613
Confident. That's my favorite word I've learned.

00:56.007 --> 00:56.841
I learned that here,...

00:57.165 --> 01:01.055
...and I know I'm gonna get to sixth grade level by the time I get into sixth grade.

01:02.956 --> 01:04.341
I'm not giving up anytime soon.
