And that's why I so often make movies based on real-life events.

00:04.151 --> 00:08.869
I look to history not to be didactic, 'cause that's just a bonus,...

00:09.388 --> 00:15.344
...but I look because the past is filled with the greatest stories that have ever been told.

00:16.013 --> 00:19.430
Heroes and villains are not literary constructs,...

00:19.819 --> 00:21.842
...but they're at the heart of all history.

00:22.803 --> 00:30.989
Love, support, courage, intuition.

00:32.407 --> 00:34.772
All these things are in your hero's quiver,...

00:34.930 --> 00:37.295
...but still, a hero needs one more thing.

00:37.642 --> 00:39.697
A hero needs a villain to vanquish.

00:39.947 --> 00:42.003
And you're all in luck.

00:47.689 --> 00:50.302
This world is full of monsters,...

00:50.835 --> 00:55.491
...and there's racism, homophobia, ethnic hatred, class hatred,...

00:56.253 --> 00:58.863
...there's political hatred, and there's religious hatred.

01:00.716 --> 01:07.601
And to me, and I think, to all of you, the only answer to more hate is more humanity.

01:08.369 --> 01:09.805
We gotta repair.

01:10.927 --> 01:13.663
We have to replace fear with curiosity.

01:14.099 --> 01:19.437
"Us" and "them," we'll find the "we" by connecting with each other.

01:20.134 --> 01:24.666
And finally, I wish you all a true Hollywood-style happy ending.

01:25.572 --> 01:29.625
I hope you outrun the T-rex, catch the criminal...

01:30.387 --> 01:37.613
...and for your parents' sake, maybe every now and then, just like E.T., go home.

01:38.689 --> 01:39.454
Thank you.
