00:00.283 --> 00:03.569
I teach in hopes of turning content into rocket ships,...

00:03.708 --> 00:05.309
...tribulations into telescopes,...

00:05.393 --> 00:08.477
...so a child can see their true potential from right where they stand.

00:08.537 --> 00:11.787
And injustice is telling them they are stars without acknowledging...

00:11.843 --> 00:13.309
...the night that surrounds them.

00:13.476 --> 00:16.222
Injustice is telling them education is the key...

00:16.714 --> 00:18.761
...while you continue to change the locks.

00:19.887 --> 00:21.444
Education is no equalizer.

00:22.115 --> 00:24.932
Rather, it is the sleep that precedes the American Dream.

00:25.123 --> 00:28.703
So wake up, wake up, lift your voices until you've patched every hole...

00:28.791 --> 00:30.133
..in a childâ€™s broken sky.

00:30.405 --> 00:33.488
Wake up every child so they know of their celestial potential.

00:33.743 --> 00:36.591
I've been the black hole in a classroom for far too long,...

00:36.864 --> 00:39.365
...absorbing everything, without allowing my light to escape,...

00:39.471 --> 00:40.687
...but those days are done.

00:40.894 --> 00:44.759
I belong among the stars and so do you, and so do they.

00:53.963 --> 01:00.411
Together, we can inspire galaxies of greatness for generations to come.

01:00.719 --> 01:06.193
So no, sky is not the limit, it is only the beginning.

01:06.607 --> 01:07.434
Lift off.
