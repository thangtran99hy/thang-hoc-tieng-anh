ï»¿Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup.

00:09.465 --> 00:16.777
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.

00:17.591 --> 00:23.869
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind...

00:24.267 --> 00:27.289
...possessing and caressing me.

00:39.873 --> 00:45.473
Nothing's gonna change my world.

00:46.733 --> 00:51.689
Nothing's gonna change my world.
