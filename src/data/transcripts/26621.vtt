Hello, Los Angeles.

00:05.594 --> 00:08.027
Emirates welcomes you to Dodger Stadium.

00:10.219 --> 00:16.536
This stadium has 10 gates, 21 terraced entrances and can hold over 56,000 fans.

00:17.461 --> 00:20.965
Today's game between the Cincinnati Reds and the Los Angeles Dodgers...

00:21.201 --> 00:23.033
...will consist of nine innings,...

00:24.581 --> 00:27.500
...and like our nonstop flight from Los Angeles to Dubai,...

00:27.883 --> 00:30.314
...we recommend you stretch during the seventh inning.

00:32.285 --> 00:35.683
Keep your eye on the ball in the event of a foul ball or home run.

00:36.243 --> 00:39.286
If you see coaches or umpires acting in a strange way,...

00:39.373 --> 00:40.699
...do not attempt to intervene...

00:40.764 --> 00:43.949
...as our expert staff are trained for just such emergencies.

00:44.448 --> 00:46.854
In the event of turbulent times during the game,...

00:47.149 --> 00:49.205
...your hat can act as a rally cap.

00:49.751 --> 00:54.456
To activate, turn your hat inside out and place directly on your head.

00:55.117 --> 00:59.641
Remember to always secure your rally cap first before assisting others.
