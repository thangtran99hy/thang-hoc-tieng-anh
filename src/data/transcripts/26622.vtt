00:00.707 --> 00:04.751
Now, I'm gonna take a moment later tonight and the days ahead...

00:04.877 --> 00:07.979
...to fully absorb the history we've made here.

00:13.685 --> 00:20.007
But what I care about most is the history our country has yet to write.

00:20.868 --> 00:24.386
Our children and grandchildren will look back at this time,...

00:25.054 --> 00:27.455
...at the choices we are about to make,...

00:27.958 --> 00:31.884
...the goals we will strive for, the principles we will live by.

00:32.999 --> 00:38.208
And we need to make sure that they can be proud of us.

00:38.925 --> 00:44.281
The end of the primaries is only the beginning of the work we're called to do.

00:44.722 --> 00:51.745
But if we stand together, we will rise together because we are stronger together!

00:52.128 --> 00:56.325
Let's go out and make that case to America!

00:56.537 --> 00:57.161
Thank you!

00:57.315 --> 01:00.681
God bless you all and God bless America!
