The island of Bali lies in the center of the Indonesian archipelago...

00:05.571 --> 00:07.811
...between the islands of Java and Lombok.

00:08.307 --> 00:10.053
But to the Balinese people,...

00:10.267 --> 00:13.871
...their island is considered the center of the spiritual universe.

00:19.385 --> 00:22.330
Bali has a population of around four million people...

00:22.672 --> 00:25.532
...and is home to Indonesia's Hindu population.

00:26.616 --> 00:30.096
The Balinese practice the concept of Tri Hita Karana,...

00:30.398 --> 00:34.249
...which seeks to balance the human, natural and spirit worlds.

00:34.743 --> 00:39.833
And it is this sense of harmony which makes Bali more than just a physical destination,...

00:40.039 --> 00:41.970
...but a complete state of mind.

00:43.471 --> 00:46.641
Most first-time visitors are drawn to the south of Bali,...

00:46.888 --> 00:50.677
...a region blessed with incredible beaches and world-class surf.
