00:04.075 --> 00:05.318
How tall is your mom?

00:07.653 --> 00:11.247
I think she's like 40 kilograms or something.

00:11.366 --> 00:14.412
From here to that brick.

00:14.567 --> 00:16.808
What does your mom do around the house?

00:18.141 --> 00:20.010
She cooks the dinner.

00:20.298 --> 00:21.617
She does my hair.

00:21.693 --> 00:24.327
She does my homework with me.

00:24.422 --> 00:29.010
Because my dad doesn't do any cleaning, so my mom has to do all the cleaning.

00:29.509 --> 00:31.007
She kinda does loads.

00:31.413 --> 00:32.455
She really does loads.

00:33.005 --> 00:37.351
She dresses me up for school every single day.

00:40.561 --> 00:41.935
Why do you love your mom?

00:42.663 --> 00:48.681
Because she's my mommy and she's always nice to me.

00:48.871 --> 00:57.713
I don't know, she's just really kind and funny and she's mostly on my side in arguments so..

00:57.971 --> 00:59.793
And she loves me a lot.

01:00.152 --> 01:01.367
That's really all.

01:01.690 --> 01:03.498
That's the most important part.

01:03.849 --> 01:07.266
The last one and the most important part.

01:07.575 --> 01:10.745
And this is probably a very bad drawing.
