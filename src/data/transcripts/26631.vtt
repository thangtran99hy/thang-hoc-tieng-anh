So, if you work in an office or anywhere for that matter,...

00:02.603 --> 00:04.855
...and then one day you see a dog walking around,...

00:04.985 --> 00:07.522
...my guess is that the majority of you would get excited.

00:07.655 --> 00:08.464
I know I would.

00:08.733 --> 00:13.174
So, this brings up the idea that maybe pets are good for the workplace.

00:13.463 --> 00:18.415
Now, at first the idea of having a pet at work sounds like it would be a big distraction.

00:18.592 --> 00:23.295
But in fact, a lot of big companies including companies like Google, allow pets at work.

00:23.456 --> 00:24.184
Why is this?

00:24.346 --> 00:25.803
Well, there's a number of reasons,...

00:25.900 --> 00:28.229
...one being that pets lower stress levels.

00:28.610 --> 00:32.399
Now, it's been proven that animals affect the health of hospital patients...

00:32.586 --> 00:35.499
...by lowering blood pressure and helping out with depression.

00:35.642 --> 00:39.387
But did you know that they also tested this theory out in the office?

00:39.641 --> 00:40.127
That's right.

00:40.221 --> 00:46.621
In 2012, Virginia Commonwealth University did a study with 550 office workers.

00:46.855 --> 00:50.278
Some brought their dogs into work every day while others didn't.

00:50.478 --> 00:52.606
By taking surveys and saliva samples,...

00:52.875 --> 00:56.142
...they discovered that the group that did not bring in their dogs to work...

00:56.375 --> 01:01.527
...had a significantly higher stress level at the end of the day than the group that did.
