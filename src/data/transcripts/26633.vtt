00:02.973 --> 00:06.733
I've always had that dream, like my daddy before me.

00:06.959 --> 00:10.785
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories.

00:11.100 --> 00:14.867
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me.

00:15.182 --> 00:18.801
'Cause only those I truly love will ever really know me.

00:18.907 --> 00:23.421
Once I was 20 years old, my story got told.

00:24.021 --> 00:26.701
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely.

00:27.072 --> 00:29.894
Once I was 20 years old.

00:35.516 --> 00:39.393
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure.

00:39.623 --> 00:43.333
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major.

00:43.631 --> 00:47.390
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor.

00:47.745 --> 00:51.341
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later.

00:51.437 --> 00:55.933
Once I was 20 years old, my story got told.

00:56.012 --> 00:59.039
I was writing about everything I saw before me.

00:59.623 --> 01:02.490
Once I was 20 years old.
