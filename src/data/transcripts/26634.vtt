00:02.716 --> 00:06.063
For the second year in a row, female CEOs earned more...

00:06.122 --> 00:08.971
...and received bigger raises than their male counterparts...

00:09.325 --> 00:12.405

00:12.851 --> 00:16.655

00:17.055 --> 00:21.407
The median pay for a female CEO was nearly 18 million dollars last year,...

00:21.577 --> 00:23.931
...up about 13 percent from 2014.

00:24.142 --> 00:30.526
By comparison, male CEOs' median pay was 10.5 million dollars up just three percent from earlier...

00:30.755 --> 00:33.221
...but the jump is largely due to a small sample size.

00:33.343 --> 00:38.726
Only 17 of the 341 CEOs analyzed by Equilar and the AP were women.

00:38.952 --> 00:42.425

00:42.799 --> 00:45.674
...Yahoo's Marissa Mayer, whose own position is in jeopardy...

...amid questions about the company's future.
