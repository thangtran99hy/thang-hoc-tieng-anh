00:00.816 --> 00:02.539
Arguments will often make me cry.

00:02.619 --> 00:03.725
I've inherited this from my mother...

00:03.801 --> 00:06.238
...which is like you get really frustrated and angry...

00:06.309 --> 00:08.063
...and then you start crying and they're like, "What's wrong?"...

00:08.140 --> 00:09.781
...and you're like, "I'm just so angry at you."

00:10.502 --> 00:14.624
Management to me provokes emotional reactions often, in part,...

00:14.733 --> 00:18.495
...because I care for people and I care for the people that I supervise.

00:19.017 --> 00:25.187
And so, the moments that stick out to me when I've cried have been about that.

00:25.684 --> 00:29.252
For me, it's always a combination of being tired, being stressed...

00:29.407 --> 00:31.939
...instead of getting in a mentality where I'm already feeling sorry for myself...

00:32.063 --> 00:33.652
...and then in some way that becomes reinforced.

00:33.725 --> 00:36.887
And then I just get into a very "woe is me" frame of mind...

00:36.962 --> 00:37.947
...and then start crying.

00:39.112 --> 00:40.850
So, we've got taking deep breaths.

00:41.478 --> 00:43.194
Just telling yourself not to cry.

00:43.503 --> 00:46.870
But if you can't stop the tears from coming, maybe just don't worry about it.

00:47.420 --> 00:48.787
Crying is a normal part of work.
