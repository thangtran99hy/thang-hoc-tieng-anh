00:02.221 --> 00:03.699
Tell me a little bit about your dad.

00:04.167 --> 00:05.307
Where do I begin?

00:05.522 --> 00:07.216
You know, dads are dads.

00:07.501 --> 00:10.759
Every good thing about me, it's come straight from my Dad.

00:11.220 --> 00:17.200
Ever since we lost him, life has not been the same since he's been gone.

00:17.581 --> 00:19.477
Music doesn't sound as nice,...

00:19.656 --> 00:21.431
...food doesn't taste as good.

00:24.274 --> 00:25.435
I just love him.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.157
Thank you for loving me.

00:27.847 --> 00:31.329
And I say I love him a lot that I cannot even count.

00:31.575 --> 00:35.363
I can't even express how thankful I am for him.

00:35.778 --> 00:42.013
I love very much, my dad, like everybody does, and I miss him a lot.

00:42.154 --> 00:44.166
Sometimes I dream a lot about him...

00:45.103 --> 00:47.378
...but he's done whatever he could for me.

00:48.913 --> 00:50.598
There's that old adage, "it takes one to know one,"...

00:50.889 --> 00:53.564
...and I realized that I was a good father because I had a good father.
