ï»¿The most important job I ever saw myself having one day was being a dad.

00:12.068 --> 00:15.397
It's the most rewarding thing in the planet, to see him learn something from me.

00:16.180 --> 00:20.168
It's important to pass on those little bits of knowledge that help you...

00:20.638 --> 00:22.272
...maybe stand out just a bit more,...

00:23.859 --> 00:25.589
...sharing those little father-son moments.

00:26.479 --> 00:31.677
Those memories and that platform through my father of like, being well-groomed,...

00:31.961 --> 00:36.009
...having great style and that's kinda always stuck with me as I've gotten older.

00:37.495 --> 00:38.996
My son is 15 months old.

00:39.461 --> 00:40.298
I think I would just make sure...

00:40.374 --> 00:45.063
...that he knows how important keeping himself looking presentable,...

00:45.327 --> 00:48.799
...even if it's in a sort of messy way, do you know what I mean?

00:49.471 --> 00:51.301
It's good to be organized, put-together,...

00:51.398 --> 00:54.327
...and I think that that goes into, in the way you're groomed.
