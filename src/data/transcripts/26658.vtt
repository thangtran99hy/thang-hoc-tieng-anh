00:00.483 --> 00:02.353
My wife's the reason anything gets done.

00:03.067 --> 00:05.387
She nudges me towards promise by degrees.

00:05.924 --> 00:07.415
She is a perfect symphony of one.

00:07.811 --> 00:09.888
Our son is her most beautiful reprise.

00:10.840 --> 00:13.369
We chase the melodies that seem to find us,...

00:13.459 --> 00:15.681
...until they're finished songs and start to play.

00:16.493 --> 00:19.003
When senseless acts of tragedy remind us...

00:19.094 --> 00:20.671
...that nothing here is promised,...

00:21.293 --> 00:21.978
...not one day.

00:23.221 --> 00:24.941
This show is proof that history remembers.

00:25.239 --> 00:28.092
We live through times when hate and fear seem stronger.

00:28.604 --> 00:30.871
We rise and fall and light from dying embers,...

00:31.237 --> 00:33.639
...remembrances that hope and love last longer.

00:34.361 --> 00:39.783
And love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love,...

00:40.229 --> 00:42.867
...cannot be killed or swept aside.

00:43.881 --> 00:46.766
I sing Vanessa's symphony, Eliza tells her story.

00:47.081 --> 00:49.539
Now, fill the world with music, love and pride.

00:49.633 --> 00:50.457
Thank you so much for this.
