00:00.616 --> 00:03.993
ï»¿Today, as Americans, we grieve the brutal murder,...

00:05.088 --> 00:08.947
...a horrific massacre of dozens of innocent people.

00:10.576 --> 00:15.391
We pray for their families who are grasping for answers with broken hearts.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.148
We stand with the people of Orlando,...

00:18.530 --> 00:21.827
...who have endured a terrible attack on their city.

00:23.163 --> 00:25.686
Although it's still early in the investigation,...

00:26.289 --> 00:31.261
...we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate,...

00:32.151 --> 00:36.455
...and as Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage,...

00:36.833 --> 00:39.622
...and in resolve to defend our people.

00:41.023 --> 00:45.680
As we go together, we will draw inspiration from heroic and selfless acts:...

00:46.289 --> 00:50.289
...friends who helped friends, took care of each other and saved lives.

00:51.173 --> 00:56.448
In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another.

00:57.187 --> 01:00.457
We will not give in to fear or turn against each other.

01:01.284 --> 01:04.152
Instead, we will stand united as Americans,...

01:05.018 --> 01:07.603
...to protect our people and defend our nation,...

01:08.235 --> 01:10.819
...and to take action against those who threaten us.
