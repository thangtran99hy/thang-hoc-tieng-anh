00:08.549 --> 00:12.184
I know that many of you made miracles happen to get to this day.

00:12.451 --> 00:15.744
You've shuttled between challenging classes and Greek life.

00:15.948 --> 00:17.186
You worked hard,...

00:17.306 --> 00:18.788
...studying late into the night.

00:18.962 --> 00:21.261
You've survived so much to get to this moment.

00:21.511 --> 00:22.925
However you got here, you made it.

00:23.189 --> 00:27.721
What you choose to do next is what we call in the movies the "character defining moment."

00:27.984 --> 00:29.307
The stories you are about to live...

00:29.411 --> 00:33.945
...are the ones you will be telling your children and grandchildren and therapists.

00:34.149 --> 00:38.988
But seriously, I know that graduation speakers are supposed to inspire...

00:39.388 --> 00:40.786
...and offer good advice,...

00:41.013 --> 00:42.197
...but I'm gonna be honest.

00:42.477 --> 00:44.042
The world is full of bastards.

00:44.215 --> 00:46.423
You won't always get everything you want.

00:46.766 --> 00:50.080
Life is like the Star Wars movies.

00:50.932 --> 00:54.069
Some of it is great, some of it sucks,...

00:54.615 --> 00:57.132
...but you have no choice but to sit through all of it.

00:57.385 --> 01:01.236
The moments that really matter are the moments when life tells you no,...

01:01.724 --> 01:04.873
...the days that challenge you to your very core.

01:05.163 --> 01:06.026
So, don't lose hope...

01:06.271 --> 01:07.893
...no matter how dark it gets...

01:08.069 --> 01:09.710
...just please be honest with yourself.

01:09.857 --> 01:12.916
Live your dreams, not the dreams of others.

01:13.145 --> 01:16.721
Go out and do what your teachers and parents thought could not be done.

01:16.833 --> 01:17.687
Congratulations.

01:17.811 --> 01:18.783
Congratulations.

01:18.898 --> 01:20.958
Congratulations, Class of 2016.

01:21.589 --> 01:22.405
Good luck!
