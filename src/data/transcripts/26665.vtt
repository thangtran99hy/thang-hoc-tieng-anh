00:03.274 --> 00:07.441
Speed, strength, agility, and endurance are top-flight footballer needs...

00:07.519 --> 00:10.091
...to react quickly, dominate opponents, and run fast,...

00:10.216 --> 00:11.987
...all without tiring for 90 minutes.

00:13.423 --> 00:17.087
Always quick-paced matches are played in increasingly tighter spaces.

00:17.445 --> 00:21.000
Since the 1980s, the frequency of intense movements like sprinting...

00:21.065 --> 00:24.648
...has doubled and the physique of footballers significantly increased.

00:25.569 --> 00:28.683
Being tall and strong is an obvious advantage for a goalkeeper.

00:29.013 --> 00:32.122
With an average size in European clubs around 1 meter 90,...

00:32.439 --> 00:35.646
...they can cover the goal area more easily as well as intimidate opponents.

00:36.185 --> 00:38.143
Defenders tend to be at least 1 meter 80.

00:38.745 --> 00:41.161
Positioned in central defense, they need to be strong in the air...

00:41.267 --> 00:43.171
...to win duels in their part of the pitch.

00:45.378 --> 00:48.939
Midfielders are the only players whose average size is less than 1 meter 80.

00:49.671 --> 00:52.330
Endurance and fast recovery, both essential,...

00:52.693 --> 00:56.343
...these players cover the most ground per match: more than 11 kilometers.

00:56.977 --> 01:00.225
Those positioned in the outside channels need to have the most stamina...

01:00.544 --> 01:02.267
...so they can sprint up and down the wings.

01:03.436 --> 01:07.355
Forwards like Lionel Messi are able to repeat physically demanding actions...

01:07.415 --> 01:09.091
...and run fast with the ball at their feet.

01:10.059 --> 01:13.282
Physically, players tend to have two basic body types:...

01:13.635 --> 01:16.117
...small and fast to outrun and outwit defenders,...

01:16.475 --> 01:20.161
...or tall and strong enough to impose themselves on opposition defenders.
