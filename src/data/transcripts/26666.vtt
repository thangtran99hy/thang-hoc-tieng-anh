Happy Father's Day, breakfast in bed!

00:08.103 --> 00:09.733
Oh wow, thank you!

00:09.921 --> 00:10.589
No problem.

00:10.962 --> 00:14.381
So, I was thinking, for Father's Day I thought it would be a great idea...

00:14.534 --> 00:16.583
...for you to hang out and spend the whole day with your son.

00:17.422 --> 00:17.806
Really?

00:18.403 --> 00:21.956
Yeah, what's a better way to spend Father's Day than being a father?

00:22.418 --> 00:24.439
I mean, yeah, that sounds like fun.

00:24.507 --> 00:25.845
Great, I'm gonna get the diaper bag.

00:34.676 --> 00:34.981
David?

00:36.741 --> 00:37.369
What are you doing here?

00:38.364 --> 00:40.303
My wife said it'd be a good idea to hang out with my daughter all day.

00:41.066 --> 00:42.767
My wife said the same thing about my son.

00:45.244 --> 00:45.853
That's weird.

00:46.252 --> 00:46.835
Okay, go to the park, baby.

00:48.787 --> 00:49.583
Hey, isn't that Tanner?

00:51.139 --> 00:51.782
It is Tanner.

00:52.734 --> 00:54.083
And that's Mark and his kids.

00:57.986 --> 00:58.813
Wait a minute.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.941
Best Father's Day ever.
