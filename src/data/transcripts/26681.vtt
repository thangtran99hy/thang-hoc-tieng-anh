Seventeen years ago, Larry Page teamed up with Sergey Brin to launch Google.

00:06.999 --> 00:11.283
Now, he's busy pushing two teams of engineers to launch cars into the sky.

00:11.937 --> 00:15.287
Page has been quietly bankrolling two separate California companies...

00:15.369 --> 00:16.555
...for the past several years.

00:16.923 --> 00:20.245
The first, Zee.Aero, set up shop right next to Google headquarters...

00:20.319 --> 00:22.127
...in Mountain View back in 2010.

00:22.676 --> 00:24.464
Kitty Hawk came along a few years later...

00:24.699 --> 00:26.629
...and opened their offices a few blocks away.

00:26.977 --> 00:31.262
To date, Page has reportedly pumped about 100 million dollars of his personal fortune...

00:31.529 --> 00:33.335
...into Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk.
