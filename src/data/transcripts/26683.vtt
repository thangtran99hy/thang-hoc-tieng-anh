00:02.369 --> 00:04.053
I had years to get us ready.

00:05.355 --> 00:06.482
We are going down.

00:06.752 --> 00:07.902
We never had a chance.

00:08.611 --> 00:09.861
We didn't last time either.

00:11.003 --> 00:16.216
We convinced an entire generation that this is a battle that we could win.

00:17.772 --> 00:20.818
We sacrifice for each other no matter what the cost...

00:22.691 --> 00:24.066
...and that's worth fighting for.

00:25.855 --> 00:29.458
It's the 4th of July, so let's show them some fireworks.

00:32.388 --> 00:33.423
Hold on!

00:38.521 --> 00:40.165
They like to get the landmarks.
