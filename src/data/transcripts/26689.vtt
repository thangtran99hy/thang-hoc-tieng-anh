00:00.443 --> 00:03.092
ZPD's first rabbit officer,...

00:03.311 --> 00:04.390
Judy Hopps.

00:04.542 --> 00:05.676
Ready to make the world a better place?

00:09.102 --> 00:11.183
Bad news in this city gripped by fear.

00:11.290 --> 00:12.895
What can you tell us about the animals that went savage?

00:13.409 --> 00:14.118
Are we safe?

00:14.274 --> 00:15.962
This is priority one.

00:16.191 --> 00:17.637
Hopps, parking duty.

00:19.380 --> 00:20.882
Sir, I'm not just some token bunny.

00:21.111 --> 00:22.781
You strike out, you resign.

00:22.979 --> 00:23.194
Deal.

00:28.014 --> 00:31.464
I have 36 hours left, we can only solve it together.

00:31.667 --> 00:33.979
It's not about how badly you want something,...

00:34.055 --> 00:35.671
...it's about what you are capable of.

00:36.311 --> 00:37.601
I am a real cop.

00:37.737 --> 00:39.485
Never let them see that they get to you.

00:39.653 --> 00:41.566
You bunnies, so emotional.

00:41.912 --> 00:43.535
No, no, no, do not let go!

00:44.367 --> 00:45.362
I'm gonna let go.

00:45.454 --> 00:45.676
What?!

00:46.107 --> 00:50.247
No matter what type of animal you are, change starts with you.

00:50.833 --> 00:51.207
We gotta go.

00:51.269 --> 00:51.737
Whose car is it?

00:51.815 --> 00:53.777
The most feared crime boss - Mr. Big.
