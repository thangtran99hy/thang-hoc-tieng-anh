00:01.684 --> 00:12.262
Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high,...

00:13.163 --> 00:22.487
...there's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby.

00:23.912 --> 00:32.690
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue.

00:34.636 --> 00:42.413
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.

00:46.856 --> 00:58.204
Someday I'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are far behind me.

00:58.879 --> 01:04.147
Where troubles melt like lemon drops, away above the chimney tops,...

01:04.434 --> 01:09.901
...that's where you'll find me.

01:10.584 --> 01:15.845
Find me.

01:18.864 --> 01:29.614
Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly.

01:30.726 --> 01:35.705
Birds fly over the rainbow,...

01:36.110 --> 01:39.831
...why then, oh why can't I?
