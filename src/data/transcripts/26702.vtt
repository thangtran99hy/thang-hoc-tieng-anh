ï»¿You're still in bed at ten and work began at eight.

00:08.825 --> 00:13.799
You've burned your breakfast, so far things are going great.

00:14.735 --> 00:18.299
Your mother warned you there'd be days like these.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.201
Oh but she didn't tell you...

00:21.465 --> 00:25.349
...when the world has brought you down on your knees.

00:25.458 --> 00:28.999
And I'll be there for you...

00:29.736 --> 00:31.649
...when the rain starts to pour.

00:31.815 --> 00:34.687
I'll be there for you...

00:35.376 --> 00:37.267
...like I've been there before.

00:37.507 --> 00:40.373
I'll be there for you...

00:40.963 --> 00:43.910
...'cause you're there for me too.
