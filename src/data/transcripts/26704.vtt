00:06.539 --> 00:07.998
ï»¿Let me hear you sing.

00:08.615 --> 00:12.341
Take me out to the ball game.

00:12.716 --> 00:16.156
Take me out with the crowd.

00:16.815 --> 00:20.534
Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack.

00:20.887 --> 00:24.099
I don't care if I never get back.

00:24.248 --> 00:28.473
Let me root, root, root for the home team.

00:28.781 --> 00:31.899
If they don't win, it's a shame.

00:32.223 --> 00:33.618
For it's one,...

00:34.094 --> 00:34.550
...two,...

00:35.082 --> 00:40.487
...three strikes, you're out at the old ball game.

00:40.552 --> 00:40.948
Let's go.

00:41.251 --> 00:42.368
For it's one,...

00:43.728 --> 00:44.392
...two,...

00:45.691 --> 00:51.662
...three strikes, you're out at the old ball game.
