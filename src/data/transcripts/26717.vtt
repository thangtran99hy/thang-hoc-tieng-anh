ï»¿Today, I'm gonna show you a really cool experiment with water and ground black pepper.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.504
Start by taking a plate.

00:09.665 --> 00:11.628
I like to use a white one like this...

00:11.881 --> 00:13.255
...and pour on some water.

00:16.240 --> 00:20.226
Then take your pepper and sprinkle a bit all over the water like this.

00:20.893 --> 00:23.227
You can see the pepper sits on the surface of the water,...

00:23.335 --> 00:26.083
...and if you dip your fingertip in, nothing really happens.

00:26.210 --> 00:29.132
You might get some pepper stuck to your finger, but that's about it.

00:29.887 --> 00:31.618
Next, take some washing-up liquid...

00:31.783 --> 00:34.939
...and wipe a tiny amount on the end of your finger like this,...

00:35.259 --> 00:37.624
...then try dipping your finger into the water again.

00:38.517 --> 00:41.934
As you can see, the pepper seems to magically shoot away from your finger.

00:43.458 --> 00:44.605
So, here's what's happening.

00:44.775 --> 00:48.088
The pepper sits on the water because of the high water surface tension.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.766
The water molecules are strongly attracted together.

00:51.247 --> 00:54.355
When we add a little soap, we break down this surface tension...

00:54.533 --> 00:57.255
...and the top layer of water molecules very quickly spread out...

00:57.353 --> 00:58.765
...and carry the pepper with them.

00:58.974 --> 00:59.977
Pretty cool, huh?
