Hello Bobby! What's wrong?

00:07.067 --> 00:08.627
Are your tires flat?

00:11.856 --> 00:13.725
Are your windows broken?

00:16.782 --> 00:19.333
Have your lights stopped working?

00:22.246 --> 00:24.549
What do you think is wrong with Bobby?

00:27.139 --> 00:30.433
It sounds like your fuel tank is nearly empty.

00:30.919 --> 00:32.262
Shall we give you a top-up?

00:34.417 --> 00:37.586
Fill, fill, fill, let's fill up your tank.

00:37.974 --> 00:41.144
For all of this fuel, I'm sure you'll thank.

00:41.640 --> 00:44.190
Let's fix that light that was so dim.
