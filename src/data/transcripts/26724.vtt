ï»¿Blackbird singing in the dead of night.

00:09.632 --> 00:13.339
Take these broken wings and learn to fly.

00:14.784 --> 00:17.025
All your life,...

00:18.685 --> 00:23.304
...you were only waiting for this moment to arise.

00:28.995 --> 00:31.879
Blackbird singing in the dead of night.

00:33.441 --> 00:36.777
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see.

00:38.661 --> 00:40.587
All your life,..

00:42.542 --> 00:46.897
...you were only waiting for this moment to be free.

00:47.791 --> 00:51.309
Blackbird, fly.

00:52.947 --> 00:56.266
Blackbird, fly...

00:57.373 --> 01:00.631
...into the light of the dark, black night.
