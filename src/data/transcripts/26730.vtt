Snapchat is bigger than Twitter.

00:02.443 --> 00:08.105
According to a report by Bloomberg, Snapchat has 150 million daily users.

00:08.530 --> 00:12.893
Twitter has an estimated 140 million people using the service daily.

00:13.297 --> 00:16.663
That Twitter number was figured out from Twitter's official monthly metric...

00:16.990 --> 00:19.750
...of 310 million active users.

00:20.188 --> 00:23.037
Neither company confirmed their daily user numbers.

00:23.431 --> 00:26.377
If these figures are accurate that's bad news for Twitter...

00:26.667 --> 00:29.828
...as the service has been struggling to compete in the social media space.

00:30.365 --> 00:31.707
Twitter's been around for ten years...

00:31.919 --> 00:34.499
...while Snapchat has been around for only four years.

00:34.939 --> 00:38.107
Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey spoke at the Code Conference this week...

00:38.440 --> 00:41.983
...and said he finds Snapchat very modern and applauded its interface.

00:42.457 --> 00:44.709
Dorsey even described Twitter as confusing.
