00:01.473 --> 00:02.903
I hope this letter finds you well.

00:03.426 --> 00:07.495
I was looking at some pictures yesterday and it made me think of you.

00:07.936 --> 00:10.743
We've had a wonderful seven years together.

00:10.977 --> 00:14.444
It has been an honor to have called you a teammate for 13 years.

00:14.768 --> 00:17.767
I'm grateful for your love and support and I know you have my back.

00:18.254 --> 00:20.409
I feel like we've had a special bond.

00:20.984 --> 00:23.469
It has been a privilege to watch you play over your career...

00:23.924 --> 00:25.331
...and I'm honored to call you a friend.

00:25.753 --> 00:26.927
You did it the right way.

00:27.103 --> 00:31.403
And I knew that you loved to win and hated to lose with the same passion as me.

00:31.745 --> 00:33.549
You know I've always looked up to you.

00:34.046 --> 00:38.250
To play as long as you did and at such a high level is incredible.

00:38.474 --> 00:39.558
You've taught me a lot.

00:39.950 --> 00:43.019
I have great respect for your work ethic and "team first" attitude.

00:43.331 --> 00:44.625
It wasn't always easy.

00:44.982 --> 00:46.942
Some things you just can't control.

00:47.350 --> 00:47.824
It's okay.

00:48.391 --> 00:51.120
You're the best teammate I could ever ask for.

00:51.787 --> 00:54.769
It was an honor to play with you in Indy and again in Denver,...

00:55.101 --> 00:56.424
...to be Broncos together,...

00:56.919 --> 00:57.511
...brothers.

00:58.034 --> 00:59.720
It's been a great ride.

01:00.831 --> 01:01.996
Keep grinding.

01:02.235 --> 01:04.566
I wish you all the best in the next chapter of your life.

01:04.887 --> 01:06.214
Congratulations again.

01:06.507 --> 01:07.689
Tell the family hello.

01:08.077 --> 01:08.807
Love you, pal.

01:09.562 --> 01:10.157
I'm proud of you.

01:10.804 --> 01:11.399
Sincerely.

01:12.183 --> 01:12.987
Sincerely.

01:13.763 --> 01:14.389
Sincerely.
