00:05.629 --> 00:08.159
Where have all the good men gone...

00:08.295 --> 00:10.419
...and where are all the gods?

00:10.573 --> 00:15.983
Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the rising odds?

00:16.247 --> 00:21.373
Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?

00:21.520 --> 00:26.595
Late at night I toss and turn and I dream of what I need.

00:27.787 --> 00:29.291
I need a hero.

00:30.179 --> 00:33.533
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night.

00:33.970 --> 00:35.413
He's got to be strong...

00:35.485 --> 00:37.039
...and he's gotta be fast...

00:37.104 --> 00:39.771
...and he's gotta be fresh from the fight.

00:40.197 --> 00:41.753
I need a hero.
