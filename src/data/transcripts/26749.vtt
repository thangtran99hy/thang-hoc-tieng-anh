People tend to find it a little annoying for celebrities to be vocal about politics,...

00:04.251 --> 00:04.938
...and I get it.

00:05.315 --> 00:07.472
I know. I'm an actress, I'm not a world leader.

00:08.093 --> 00:11.670
And the line of reasoning is, these bright, shiny objects get more airtime...

00:11.776 --> 00:13.981
...not because they're more informed or they're any smarter,...

00:14.067 --> 00:16.333
...but just because they played some badass hero in a movie,...

00:16.592 --> 00:17.629
...and they think they know everything.

00:18.707 --> 00:21.252
I've often been told by trolls to stick to acting...

00:21.353 --> 00:23.440
...or to shut up because I'm a stupid celebrity.

00:24.226 --> 00:26.219
But you know what, I don't care.

00:26.736 --> 00:27.855
I don't care.

00:28.009 --> 00:30.098
There's too much to fight for.

00:30.993 --> 00:35.154
While we're distracted with pretty Instagram shots of coffee and celebrity breakups,...

00:35.579 --> 00:38.032
...our freedoms are at risk of slipping away.
