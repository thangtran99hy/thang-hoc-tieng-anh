00:00.961 --> 00:02.529
In the beginning of the 18th century,...

00:02.705 --> 00:06.775
...Peter the Great had this idea to make a new capital for Russia,...

00:06.907 --> 00:12.028
...and he wanted to make it right here, next to the Baltic Sea,...

00:12.133 --> 00:13.515
...to have the window to Europe.

00:13.811 --> 00:19.372
He was inspired by Amsterdam with its channels and he loved Holland so much,...

00:19.459 --> 00:22.031
...and he wanted to use all of this European experience he had.

00:22.300 --> 00:26.784
And his friends were telling him, and all the people around were telling that,...

00:26.884 --> 00:30.178
..."You're crazy. You can't make a city here because it's a swamp."

00:30.333 --> 00:36.723
Still, he built the city and it was 320 years ago.

00:37.249 --> 00:42.029
I think Peter the Great probably was the most charismatic character in our history.

00:42.399 --> 00:46.003
And even if we understand now that maybe he was so cruel...

00:46.328 --> 00:50.613
...and maybe it was too much, the way he made all his reforms,...

00:50.748 --> 00:55.342
...still, I think we love him and we respect the things he's done.
