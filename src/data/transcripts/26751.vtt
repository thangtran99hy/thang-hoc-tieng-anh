ï»¿Kiss a stranger for five seconds?

00:07.019 --> 00:08.034
Just kiss that guy.

00:15.842 --> 00:16.719
Okay.

00:16.828 --> 00:17.511
Okay, bye.

00:19.056 --> 00:21.295
Apparently, the watchers want me to team up with you.

00:21.473 --> 00:23.520
I don't think I'd make a very good partner.

00:23.619 --> 00:25.449
Stay, let's see what else happens.

00:26.598 --> 00:27.031
Okay.

00:28.876 --> 00:29.845
What happens if I bail?

00:30.224 --> 00:31.056
You lose everything.

00:32.145 --> 00:33.947
All of our money is missing.

00:34.099 --> 00:34.894
Wait mom, what?

00:35.481 --> 00:37.298
Officer, officer, I need help.

00:37.515 --> 00:38.885
Vee, don't do this.

00:39.081 --> 00:39.806
How did you know my name?

00:40.053 --> 00:41.212
What the hell is going on?

00:41.355 --> 00:43.023
Watchers, they stole our identity.

00:43.133 --> 00:44.775
We became prisoners of the game.

00:45.197 --> 00:47.387
Vee, we control your life.

00:47.547 --> 00:48.789
The only way out is to win.

00:49.462 --> 00:50.793
Now remember, you're my eyes.

00:51.333 --> 00:51.980
No way.

00:53.569 --> 00:54.335
Faster!

01:00.970 --> 01:05.749
Players, show us your weapons.
