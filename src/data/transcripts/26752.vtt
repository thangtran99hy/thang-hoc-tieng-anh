00:01.486 --> 00:05.785
﻿Winning a football match is about more than bringing together 11 gifted players.

00:06.057 --> 00:08.793
It's about team spirit and good tactics.

00:09.729 --> 00:15.313
The 4-3-3 formation is made up of four defenders, three midfielders and three forwards.

00:15.633 --> 00:18.999
Two wingers play high up the pitch to prevent counterattacks...

00:19.087 --> 00:22.628
...and the central striker harries the opposition's central defense.

00:23.733 --> 00:28.421
In the well-known but now lesser-used 4-4-2 or "flat four" system,...

00:28.722 --> 00:30.637
...midfielders operate in the corridors...

00:30.707 --> 00:33.939
...when they get possession to pass the ball on to the two forwards.

00:34.295 --> 00:36.445
It can also be played in a diamond formation...

00:36.517 --> 00:40.616
...with one midfielder in front of the defense and another supporting the forwards.

00:41.444 --> 00:46.689
World-class playmakers like Pelé, Maradona and Zidane express themselves best...

00:47.027 --> 00:49.663
...in the flexible 4-2-3-1 system,...

00:49.860 --> 00:52.473
...setting up attacks from the middle of the line of three.

00:53.241 --> 00:56.783
Teams that opt for the 4-1-4-1 formation are more defensive.

00:57.203 --> 01:00.479
The aim is to neutralize the game and creativity of the opposition...

01:00.564 --> 01:02.124
...while launching counterattacks.

01:02.535 --> 01:06.386
This system depends upon defensive rigor and tactical discipline.

01:06.841 --> 01:12.116
It proved a winning formula for the Greeks in their surprise Euro 2004 victory.
