ï»¿Hi!

00:02.153 --> 00:04.563
Terry Liskevych, head coach of Oregon State,...

00:05.013 --> 00:07.209
...former USA national Women's coach.

00:07.348 --> 00:11.587
I've always felt that serving is a very important skill.

00:11.893 --> 00:15.354
It's the only skill that you control in volleyball.

00:15.545 --> 00:17.857
In teaching serving to your teams,...

00:18.338 --> 00:20.684
...the first thing you ought to do at a very young age...

00:20.809 --> 00:23.252
...is teach people to get the ball over the net.

00:23.633 --> 00:26.847
The first thing I would do is teach a sidearm serve...

00:27.328 --> 00:30.490
...so that, you could teach somebody just hitting the ball sidearm...

00:30.558 --> 00:34.404
...so they don't have to tax their shoulder, I teach a sidearm floater.

00:35.093 --> 00:41.708
Then, the next serve we would really emphasize is a standing float serve,...

00:42.115 --> 00:44.199
...and that's where you're standing on the floor,...

00:44.498 --> 00:47.434
...tossing the ball in front of you, hitting the center of the ball...

00:47.624 --> 00:49.435
...to make the ball float over the net.

00:50.271 --> 00:54.434
Other variations that you can teach your team are standing on the floor,...

00:54.756 --> 00:59.251
...having a topspin serve, where you're tossing the ball at the back of you,...

00:59.657 --> 01:01.605
...hitting the ball with topspin over the net.

01:01.885 --> 01:04.721
And the final two serves are a jump float,...

01:05.360 --> 01:08.058
...where you're jumping off the ground and hitting a float serve,...

01:08.476 --> 01:11.203
...and then finally is a jump topspin.

01:11.685 --> 01:15.359
This is a serve that has the most velocity so that's what you want.
