00:02.483 --> 00:06.439
ï»¿In this segment, we are working three great plyometric exercises...

00:06.517 --> 00:10.740
...to help volleyball players build the leg strength needed to jump higher.

00:16.069 --> 00:20.154
High knee skips are a challenging exercise, activating your hip flexors...

00:20.328 --> 00:24.612
...as well as improving leg strength, coordination and endurance.

00:29.527 --> 00:34.926
Frog hops are a great exercise for developing explosive jumping power,...

00:35.199 --> 00:37.069
...working the quads and hamstrings.

00:37.288 --> 00:40.354
Just think for a second about the body size of a frog...

00:40.557 --> 00:43.541
...and then look at the height and distance of their jumps.

00:46.669 --> 00:51.581
Skater drills are great for working explosive power, balance and body control.

00:51.944 --> 00:56.043
This drill can be done at a slower pace, working strength and balance,...

00:56.205 --> 01:00.365
...or at maximum effort, spending as little time as possible on the ground,...

01:00.624 --> 01:02.679
...working on explosive jumping power.
