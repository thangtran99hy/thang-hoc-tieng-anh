ï»¿A vote by the British people to leave the EU would be a huge and historic shock.

00:06.049 --> 00:08.185
Here's what to expect in the aftermath.

00:09.362 --> 00:11.103
The unprecedented occasion of a nation...

00:11.175 --> 00:13.737
...leaving the biggest union of countries in history...

00:13.842 --> 00:17.017
...may result in an emergency meeting of EU top brass.

00:17.371 --> 00:20.410
Expect pro-Europe France and Germany to do everything...

00:20.478 --> 00:22.313
...to show the alliance remains united.

00:22.907 --> 00:26.371
While all this is happening, there could be wild swings in the British currency,...

00:26.745 --> 00:29.413
...lively market reactions and even a crash.

00:29.947 --> 00:32.913
One thing we know for sure is that just four days after the result,...

00:33.067 --> 00:35.597
...all 28 EU leaders will hold a summit.

00:36.235 --> 00:39.489
They'll be fearful inaction could give momentum to populist groups...

00:39.569 --> 00:42.206
...looking to gain power following the UK's exit.

00:42.557 --> 00:46.169
A general election is due to take place in Spain almost immediately.

00:46.496 --> 00:48.277
European leaders will have to look strong...

00:48.350 --> 00:51.126
...to prevent anti-EU feeling from other countries.

00:51.697 --> 00:55.672
Into the first hundred days, could there be a domino effect of discontent?

00:56.014 --> 00:59.451
Holland, Germany and France all have national elections coming up.

00:59.944 --> 01:04.317
This could impact how they negotiate with the UK and could weaken Britain's hand.

01:04.955 --> 01:08.717
In the long term, Britain has two whole years to negotiate an exit.

01:09.248 --> 01:13.571
Some talks could take much longer, and the UK would lose some influence.

01:13.957 --> 01:16.571
We can expect a chaotic and drawn-out drama...

01:16.788 --> 01:19.409
...before we really know what the new Britain will look like.
