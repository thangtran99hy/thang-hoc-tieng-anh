Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water.

00:06.131 --> 00:10.669
Jack fell down and broke his crown, and Jill came tumbling after.

00:10.910 --> 00:15.706
Then up got Jack and said to Jill, as in his arms he took her,...

00:15.923 --> 00:18.093
...brush up that dirt for you're not hurt,...

00:18.221 --> 00:20.627
...let's fetch that pail of water.

00:20.733 --> 00:25.510
So, Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch the pail of water.

00:25.622 --> 00:30.496
And took it home to mother dear who thanked her son and daughter.

00:30.713 --> 00:35.307
Up Jack got, and home did trot, as fast as he could caper,...

00:35.467 --> 00:40.231
...to old Dame Dob, who patched his nob with vinegar and brown paper.

00:40.369 --> 00:45.087
Then, Jill came in and she did grin to see Jack's paper plaster.

00:45.255 --> 00:50.158
Her mother whipped her across her knee for laughing at Jack's disaster.
