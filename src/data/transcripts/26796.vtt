There's a place in your heart and I know that it is love...

00:13.731 --> 00:19.086
...and this place could be much brighter than tomorrow.

00:19.517 --> 00:25.059
And if you really try, you'll find there's no need to cry.

00:25.292 --> 00:30.945
In this place, you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow.

00:31.393 --> 00:36.918
There are ways to get there, if you care enough for the living.

00:37.193 --> 00:42.256
Make a little space, make a better place.

00:42.647 --> 00:48.383
Heal the world, make it a better place...

00:48.779 --> 00:53.853
...for you and for me and the entire human race.

00:54.183 --> 00:57.181
There are people dying.

00:57.457 --> 01:00.055
If you care enough for the living,...

01:00.355 --> 01:04.495
...make a better place for you and for me.
