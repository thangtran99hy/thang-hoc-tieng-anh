This year, wireless earbuds have been a real big buzz topic.

00:02.664 --> 00:05.271
We've seen a couple of companies, a couple of start-ups try their efforts,...

00:05.693 --> 00:09.161
...and now we're looking at Samsung's new Gear IconX,...

00:09.289 --> 00:11.766
...and these are truly wireless earbuds.

00:12.019 --> 00:12.955
They just sit in your ear.

00:13.052 --> 00:14.543
They can stream music to your ears...

00:14.809 --> 00:16.620
...and they can also track a whole bunch of fitness things.

00:16.963 --> 00:19.979
Really, the fitness angle is what Samsung's big pitch here is.

00:20.423 --> 00:22.226
They can track your distance, your heart rate.

00:22.937 --> 00:24.431
It can interpret your calories burned, stuff like that,...

00:24.491 --> 00:27.827
...and it syncs with Samsung's S Health app on your phone,...

00:28.095 --> 00:29.783
...but it can also do all that stuff stand-alone.

00:30.389 --> 00:33.589
Now, these little earbuds come in a case, like you can see here,...

00:33.757 --> 00:36.676
...which charges them, provides 2X battery charge on there,...

00:37.366 --> 00:41.565
...but then they'd pop into your ear like so, when they'll automatically turn on.

00:42.041 --> 00:46.270
You've got some basic commands on your touchpad here.

00:46.563 --> 00:49.273
Very similar to the Bragi Dash in terms of shape and size,...

00:49.411 --> 00:51.467
...but they are really small, really light...

00:51.550 --> 00:53.831
...and they're really easy to fit into your ear.
