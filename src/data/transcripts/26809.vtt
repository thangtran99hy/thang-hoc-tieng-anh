In the 1960s, at the height of the space race,...

00:08.184 --> 00:11.464
...space food was either compressed into utilitarian packages...

00:11.617 --> 00:13.239
...or pureed into a tube.

00:14.154 --> 00:18.135
NASA did this in part to reduce the dangers free-floating crumbs could pose,...

00:18.351 --> 00:20.818
...like wreaking havoc on the space capsule's instruments.

00:21.477 --> 00:24.619
During the Gemini 3 mission, astronaut John Young...

00:24.722 --> 00:25.901
...didn't quite get the memo...

00:25.973 --> 00:28.859
...when he snuck a contraband corned beef sandwich into space.

00:30.041 --> 00:33.038
Sure, the sandwich could have caused a life-threatening accident,...

00:35.187 --> 00:38.420
...but, hey, wouldn't you wanna know how a sandwich tasted in space?

00:40.109 --> 00:42.952
Young was reprimanded for his actions, but luckily for him,...

00:43.045 --> 00:44.817
...the incident didn't derail his career.

00:45.305 --> 00:48.423
He later was part of the Apollo 16 mission and walked on the moon.

00:49.076 --> 00:51.801
But that time, he made sure to leave his packed lunch at home.

00:52.654 --> 00:53.857
Tranquility Base here.

00:54.129 --> 00:55.131
The Eagle has landed.
