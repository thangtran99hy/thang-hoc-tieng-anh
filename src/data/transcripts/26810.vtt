00:09.863 --> 00:11.541
I'm gonna be a spaceship engineer.

00:12.187 --> 00:12.855
Nice!

00:13.283 --> 00:17.102
It's my passion to be singing on a stage.

00:17.235 --> 00:18.694
I'll probably buy Jupiter.

00:18.859 --> 00:24.469
I'm going to be a bubble master.

00:30.220 --> 00:34.192
I don't understand it when adults are so busy on their phone.

00:34.537 --> 00:35.371
All they do is just...

00:38.089 --> 00:40.647
"I have to get this done, stop talking to me."

00:41.009 --> 00:43.561
Stressed out, tired, they're sad.

00:44.285 --> 00:47.335
I don't understand why adults get so stressed out.

00:47.885 --> 00:48.201
Yeah!

00:51.572 --> 00:52.553
Time goes fast.

00:52.779 --> 00:53.437
It certainly does.

00:53.505 --> 00:55.169
Oh, trust me on that one.

00:55.317 --> 00:56.912
How did I ever get to be this age?

00:57.169 --> 00:58.800
It happens overnight.

00:58.932 --> 01:03.459
It's like, you go to sleep and you're 25 and you wake up and you're 70.

01:03.637 --> 01:05.781
When I was thinking about being 55 years old...

01:05.839 --> 01:07.095
...and thinking I was going to be old and decrepit...

01:07.200 --> 01:08.347
...and then, the next thing I knew, I was 60.
