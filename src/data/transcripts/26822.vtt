Ramsay Bolton of "Game of Thrones" was a terrible leader of the North...

00:03.881 --> 00:06.719
...and made numerous errors during the "Battle of the Bastards."

00:07.299 --> 00:10.521
Here are three leadership takeaways from his final episode.

00:10.724 --> 00:12.750
1. Lead by example.

00:13.029 --> 00:15.903
Will your men wanna fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?

00:18.657 --> 00:19.075
He's good.

00:19.562 --> 00:22.616
In the thick of battle, Ramsay watched while his men fought.

00:23.375 --> 00:25.173
Actions speak louder than words.

00:25.687 --> 00:27.573
You cannot expect employees to do the work...

00:27.723 --> 00:29.590
...that you yourself are not willing to do.

00:30.019 --> 00:33.539
Remember, employees leave managers, not companies.

00:33.897 --> 00:36.687
2. Don't waste resources.

00:37.823 --> 00:39.304
We'll just kill our own men. Stand down!

00:40.149 --> 00:40.657
Loose!

00:41.958 --> 00:45.339
Ramsay had no problem depleting his army quickly in order to win,...

00:45.834 --> 00:49.262
...but in reality, resource allocation is critical to strategy.

00:49.824 --> 00:52.837
Consider the larger picture beyond narrowly focused goals...

00:53.019 --> 00:56.277
...to understand the scope of your financial and human resources,...

00:56.697 --> 01:01.039
...budget low and set aside additional resources to account for any emergencies.

01:01.880 --> 01:03.692
3. Have a backup plan.

01:04.229 --> 01:08.021
Ramsay's inability to plot for the worst inevitably led to his downfall.

01:08.607 --> 01:10.650
My hounds will never harm me.

01:11.473 --> 01:14.333
You haven't fed them in seven days, you said it yourself.

01:15.053 --> 01:18.232
Good leaders anticipate the possibility of failure from the start.

01:18.681 --> 01:20.436
Don't hesitate to change direction,...

01:20.689 --> 01:25.240
...implement Plan B or adjust the pace when an initiative doesn't go as planned.
