ï»¿Our next experiment embraces one of the most dangerous forces of nature.

00:06.880 --> 00:10.941
Almost four million people have watched red-hot lava meet ice.

00:12.758 --> 00:16.757
We caught up with artist Bob Wysocki and geologist Jeff Karson...

00:18.582 --> 00:20.212
...and their rumbling lava furnace...

00:20.285 --> 00:22.069
...to ask them what they thought would happen.

00:24.597 --> 00:26.807
I had no idea what it was gonna do.

00:27.632 --> 00:28.191
No idea at all.

00:28.497 --> 00:30.307
The first guess is always it's gonna explode,...

00:30.877 --> 00:31.746
...always number one,...

00:32.334 --> 00:33.312
...or it's gonna tunnel down,...

00:33.377 --> 00:36.238
...it's just gonna dig right through the ice, melt a hole in the ice.

00:36.371 --> 00:38.342
And of course, it didn't do any of those things.

00:49.887 --> 00:53.042
I was stunned by what it did when it hit the ice.

00:53.505 --> 00:54.253
You see the bubbles,...

00:54.698 --> 00:57.056
...bubbles this big, and then there's bubbles within bubbles.

00:59.871 --> 01:04.173
The "scrambled eggs from hell" is the way it looks in that video.

01:04.599 --> 01:07.175
Just two things we just didn't really expect.
