00:04.751 --> 00:07.801
When your legs don't work like they used to before...

00:10.862 --> 00:13.149
...and I can't sweep you off of your feet,...

00:16.820 --> 00:19.892
...will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?

00:22.805 --> 00:25.632
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

00:26.673 --> 00:34.653
And darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70.

00:38.720 --> 00:46.419
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23.

00:48.740 --> 00:56.343
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways,...

00:57.614 --> 01:01.611
...maybe just the touch of a hand.

01:03.471 --> 01:08.755
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day...

01:09.559 --> 01:13.639
...and I just wanna tell you I am.

01:14.355 --> 01:16.600
So honey now,...

01:19.651 --> 01:22.585
...take me into your loving arms.

01:25.741 --> 01:29.819
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars.

01:31.713 --> 01:34.726
Place your head on my beating heart.

01:35.856 --> 01:38.439
I'm thinking out loud.

01:38.896 --> 01:44.984
Maybe we found love right where we are.
