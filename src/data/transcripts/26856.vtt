I started playing here at East Beach when I was seven years old with my parents...

00:06.256 --> 00:09.298
...and I have never stayed away from this beach...

00:09.476 --> 00:13.589
...for longer than, probably nine months; it's been a great place for me.

00:14.343 --> 00:19.165
All my life, it's kept me in shape and kept me with a bunch of friends...

00:19.326 --> 00:21.815
...that I've gotten to know over the years...

00:21.911 --> 00:24.346
...and played volleyball with and hung out with.

00:25.418 --> 00:29.837
If you go from Point Conception, south of the Mexican border along the coast,...

00:30.988 --> 00:33.783
...this really is the center of beach volleyball for the United States.

00:34.659 --> 00:38.117
The United States has had gold medalists over the years for beach volleyball...

00:39.189 --> 00:41.385
...because of Southern California.

00:41.921 --> 00:45.955
Well, East Beach has probably the best courts and best lines...

00:46.917 --> 00:51.543
...and overall best facilities, maybe up and down the coast.

00:51.648 --> 00:56.117
I can't think of another beach that has this many courts...

00:56.259 --> 00:59.410
...that are this good in shape and it's been like that forever.

00:59.572 --> 01:01.408
Ever since I've been playing down here, it's been the same.

01:02.258 --> 01:04.152
I have to thank the city of Santa Barbara for that.

01:04.271 --> 01:07.023
But that really, that consistency, has made this place great.

01:08.119 --> 01:11.006
That allows everybody to come down here week after week,...

01:11.605 --> 01:14.059
...month after month, always know that they have a place,...

01:14.368 --> 01:18.997
...that's family-friendly and volleyball-friendly.

01:19.781 --> 01:24.291
Nothing has changed though development has occured and it's gorgeous.

01:24.565 --> 01:27.379
That makes East Beach so much better, you can just come down here...

01:27.447 --> 01:29.855
...and really get a good workout and really good volleyball.
