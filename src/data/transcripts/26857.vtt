People love to dream...

00:05.632 --> 00:07.275
...because dreams are awesome.

00:09.580 --> 00:12.540
We dream at night and we dream during the day.

00:14.443 --> 00:17.067
When we're young, we dream about what we wanna be when we're older.

00:18.535 --> 00:20.858
And when we grow older, we dream about being young again.

00:22.742 --> 00:24.212
In dreams, you can fly...

00:25.241 --> 00:28.619
...and if you can't, you'll probably run into someone who can.

00:33.397 --> 00:34.952
In dreams, you can go anywhere...

00:37.657 --> 00:41.693
...like a distant land overrun by dinosaurs who sound like your good friend Carl.

00:42.150 --> 00:43.174
Oh hey, what's up?

00:46.764 --> 00:48.864
And even if these dreams become nightmares,...

00:49.871 --> 00:52.705
...where all your teeth fall out and suddenly you're in school,...

00:53.578 --> 00:54.529
...it's only a dream,...

00:55.873 --> 00:57.099
...where your crush loves you anyway,...

00:58.665 --> 01:01.287
...which is much better than being stuck on a bus with this guy.

01:03.683 --> 01:06.291
So, if you could experience anything in a dream...

01:06.674 --> 01:08.485
...just by putting a phone on your face,...

01:09.476 --> 01:10.690
...why wouldn't you get that phone?

01:11.884 --> 01:14.596
