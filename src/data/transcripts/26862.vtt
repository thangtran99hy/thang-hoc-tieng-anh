Sorry everyone, there's science here and you're not gonna like it.

00:07.951 --> 00:12.388
Some people are much more attractive to those annoying flying little mosquitoes,...

00:12.789 --> 00:14.823
...and a lot of it comes down to carbon dioxide.

00:15.604 --> 00:20.451
Some people actually give off more CO2 than others and mosquitoes are huge fans.

00:21.016 --> 00:26.153
In fact, female mosquitoes have nerve cells with special receptors just to detect CO2.

00:26.689 --> 00:31.020
Larger people, hyperactive people and people who have just exercised...

00:31.175 --> 00:33.541
...all give off more CO2 than average.

00:34.260 --> 00:36.541
Unfortunately, it's not just CO2 to blame.

00:36.947 --> 00:41.111
Research has shown mosquitoes also really dig type O blood.

00:42.047 --> 00:46.087
They're significantly more likely to land on them as people with type A blood.

00:46.676 --> 00:49.426
So, the idea that some people have sweet blood...

00:49.939 --> 00:51.898
...may actually not be that far off.
