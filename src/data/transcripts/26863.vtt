00:02.570 --> 00:06.211
The type of material used on a tennis court can vastly affect gameplay.

00:06.539 --> 00:08.738
Three main types dominate the pro circuit.

00:09.348 --> 00:12.059
Hard courts featured at the Australian and US Open...

00:12.213 --> 00:14.049
...are perfect for an attacking game,...

00:14.349 --> 00:18.424
...courts consist of synthetic or acrylic layers on top of concrete or asphalt.

00:18.791 --> 00:20.647
This creates a rigid uniform surface,...

00:20.727 --> 00:24.220
...which means the ball bounces more predictably than on grass or clay.

00:25.367 --> 00:28.968
Exchanges are fast because little energy is absorbed by the surface,...

00:29.875 --> 00:33.637
...although it can be hard on the knees and ankles, meaning injuries are more likely.

00:35.484 --> 00:38.701
Clay courts as seen at the French Open have a slower surface...

00:38.913 --> 00:40.209
...that produces longer rallies.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.753
The most common form is red clay, made from brick.

00:43.395 --> 00:46.383
The top layer allows players to execute controlled slides,...

00:46.550 --> 00:49.214
...although it's not practical for use in high rainfall areas.

00:49.729 --> 00:51.495
While a quick shower won't interrupt play,...

00:51.883 --> 00:54.404
...clay courts can take a while to dry up after a rainstorm.

00:54.825 --> 00:56.987
Defensive players prefer this surface,...

00:57.224 --> 01:00.633
...which allows players to vary their effects on the ball, particularly topspin.

01:03.629 --> 01:05.053
Grass courts as used at Wimbledon...

01:05.145 --> 01:07.369
...are generally seen as one of the fastest services...

01:07.452 --> 01:09.682
...and favor the serve and volley style of play.

01:11.719 --> 01:13.785
This often produces the shortest matches.

01:14.287 --> 01:18.513
It's a cool and glare-free surface, particularly responsive to slices,...

01:18.769 --> 01:20.204
...although wears out quickly.
