ï»¿The craziest person in my family is...

00:10.463 --> 00:11.452
I'd definitely say my mom.

00:11.687 --> 00:13.625
Mom could go into a mental institution.

00:14.001 --> 00:16.668
She should be in white, padded walls at all times.

00:17.561 --> 00:18.449
Wait, let's start over.

00:19.255 --> 00:20.223
Most secretive?

00:20.833 --> 00:25.495
The most secretive person in my family is probably...

00:26.701 --> 00:27.672
I'm pretty shady.

00:28.246 --> 00:29.131
Yeah, Khloe.

00:29.552 --> 00:33.960
The bravest person in my family is...

00:34.552 --> 00:36.495
I think Kim is pretty brave.

00:36.820 --> 00:37.159
Kim.

00:37.641 --> 00:39.579
The things Kim does are wild.

00:39.905 --> 00:42.600
After you've become a mom, you're very fearful.

00:43.513 --> 00:45.017
I'm not fearless like I used to be.

00:45.388 --> 00:46.305
The bravest? Me.

00:46.680 --> 00:47.737
We're both really brave.

00:47.995 --> 00:50.670
We are, we have the Jenner in us. We're both pretty brave.

00:51.073 --> 00:52.839
Much braver than the Kardashians.

00:53.442 --> 00:55.479
The funniest person in the family is Khloe.

00:55.873 --> 00:57.258
Funniest has to be Khloe.

00:57.937 --> 00:59.681
I think Kourtney is the funniest.

00:59.759 --> 01:03.680
I agree, but Khloe is the second funniest.
