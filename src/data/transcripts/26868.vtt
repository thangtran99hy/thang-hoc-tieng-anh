If I asked you to close your eyes and think about a robot,...

00:04.662 --> 00:06.479
...maybe you envision something like this.

00:10.278 --> 00:12.686
Maybe we wanna think about robotics from a different perspective.

00:13.103 --> 00:16.217
Robotics is a field, really started in industrial settings,...

00:16.378 --> 00:19.000
...where very precise and fast motion was needed.

00:20.238 --> 00:24.079
Those same technologies are not really suitable for interacting with people.

00:27.682 --> 00:28.938
When we think of biorobotics,...

00:29.011 --> 00:31.486
...we really think of something that's more like the field of AI...

00:31.571 --> 00:32.621
...of artificial intelligence.

00:32.727 --> 00:38.145
Thinking about that combination of both the body and the brain and the group.

00:38.277 --> 00:40.373
...there's just a lot of examples in biology...

00:40.677 --> 00:42.888
...where we can see how that can be achieved...

00:42.982 --> 00:44.979
...and how we can leverage the same kinds of ideas.

00:45.978 --> 00:50.722
Almost all locomoting robots and many of the manipulator robots...

00:51.303 --> 00:54.421
...are inspired by these soft animals that we're familiar with.

00:55.601 --> 00:57.308
If we think of swarms in nature,...

00:57.399 --> 01:00.313
...let's say, you think of termites that build mounds...

01:00.453 --> 01:04.334
...or you think of ant colonies that can forage over large regions.

01:05.037 --> 01:08.560
Imagine being able to create robotic systems that could do those tasks.
