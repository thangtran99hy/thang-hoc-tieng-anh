00:02.235 --> 00:04.799
I work with wood, at it, I'm good.

00:04.930 --> 00:06.643
A carpenter is what I am.

00:07.171 --> 00:11.898
I make toys for girls and boys, also blocks, bats, tops and prams.

00:16.996 --> 00:21.377
Vessels and ladles, cots and cradles, cupboards, tables, rocking chairs,...

00:22.000 --> 00:26.517
...houses, handicrafts, boats and rafts, doors, windows, floors and stairs.

00:31.801 --> 00:35.890
Hammers and saws, chisel and awls are some tools that I use.

00:36.509 --> 00:38.825
I cut and scrape to get the right shape,...

00:38.967 --> 00:41.206
...join parts with glue, nails and screws.

00:47.084 --> 00:51.303
Hooks for wall clocks, doorstops and locks, I fit these for you.

00:51.788 --> 00:54.150
I'm so skilled there's nothing I can't build.

00:54.209 --> 00:56.297
I repair broken things, too.
