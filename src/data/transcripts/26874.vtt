00:00.805 --> 00:02.636
I've been called the "supermodel of hands."

00:02.863 --> 00:06.763
I think it's because I've had the longest career of any hand model out there.

00:06.987 --> 00:07.983
In those little seven inches,...

00:08.081 --> 00:11.769
...I have to convey a whole feeling, a whole story, a whole thought process...

00:11.831 --> 00:14.335
...about what's going into that advertising campaign.

00:18.119 --> 00:20.395
I wear gloves quite often, especially when I'm outside,...

00:20.473 --> 00:22.161
...to protect my hands from the elements...

00:22.235 --> 00:25.175
...and from things that can happen, but I take really good care of them,...

00:25.739 --> 00:28.437
...and you'll see why I'm a hand model.

00:29.928 --> 00:36.909
Because I have flawless skin and nice, long nails and very graceful hands,...

00:36.997 --> 00:38.848
...and that's really become my signature.

00:38.914 --> 00:41.288
I never know when I'm gonna have a hand modeling job.

00:41.403 --> 00:43.749
So, I could get called now and have to be somewhere in an hour.

00:44.216 --> 00:45.879
So, my hands always have to be ready to go.
