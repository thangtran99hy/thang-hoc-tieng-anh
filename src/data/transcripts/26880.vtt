It's really, really awesome going to the Olympic Trials,...

00:08.130 --> 00:12.453
...not only representing Harvard but also with my teammates, just because...

00:13.308 --> 00:15.931
...it's really nice to be able to wear that "H."

00:16.980 --> 00:20.493
Reaching for the Olympics is definitely my riskiest goal so far.

00:21.770 --> 00:25.035
I kind of came to the realization like, "Whoa, I'm on the road to Rio."

00:25.247 --> 00:28.583
"I'm actually trying to do this."

00:30.288 --> 00:32.749
Taking a step back and kind of looking at what I've been doing,...

00:32.915 --> 00:35.921
...how far I've come, it's happening really fast but it's a lot of fun...

00:36.003 --> 00:38.979
...and that's what I like about it, discovering new things about myself.

00:40.110 --> 00:42.765
We have a pretty competitive US team,...

00:42.950 --> 00:45.827
...so just to be able to even compete for a spot on that...

00:46.436 --> 00:48.320
...is such a privilege and an honor.

00:48.921 --> 00:53.163
To be able to represent the US at the Olympics would be really special.

00:53.921 --> 00:58.089
It would be amazing to wear your country on your chest...

00:58.189 --> 00:59.384
...and represent your country.
