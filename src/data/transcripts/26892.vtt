When I began, it was just meant to be the world's greatest undershirt...

00:02.493 --> 00:03.475
...just for football players.

00:03.611 --> 00:06.602
And quickly I found out it worked for baseball players and lacrosse players.

00:06.755 --> 00:07.951
And it just grew from there.

00:08.015 --> 00:10.168
And it didn't begin as one massive vision...

00:10.600 --> 00:12.524
...but it began with being committed to one idea...

00:12.839 --> 00:14.875
...and making it the very best that I could.

00:15.247 --> 00:17.499
For brands, you know trust is something that is built...

00:17.567 --> 00:19.297
...in drops and is lost in buckets.

00:19.508 --> 00:23.045
And every drop that's taking place from every day, from every sale,...

00:23.147 --> 00:25.354
...from every shirt, you know, has been establishing that trust.

00:25.588 --> 00:27.334
And when we make mistakes and we certainly do.

00:27.671 --> 00:29.254
We compromise and we take away that trust.

00:29.349 --> 00:32.225
When we do, we lose it in buckets and we're hyperaware of that.

00:32.314 --> 00:34.485
And so building trust and building equity...

00:34.694 --> 00:36.945
...and pouring that in every single day is incredibly important.
