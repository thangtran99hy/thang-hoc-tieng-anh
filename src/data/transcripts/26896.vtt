ï»¿This right here is a blue tang, the real-life Dory.

00:05.820 --> 00:09.165
They only live on coral reefs in the south Pacific.

00:09.817 --> 00:13.138
But before we get to her story, let's talk about Nemo, the clownfish.

00:13.663 --> 00:16.861
When "Finding Nemo" came out, well okay, I'll let Karen tell you.

00:17.103 --> 00:19.669
I'm Karen Burke Da Silva, I'm a marine biologist...

00:19.747 --> 00:23.543
...and a conservation biologist here at Flinders University of South Australia.

00:24.120 --> 00:25.927
So, what happened with "Finding Nemo"?

00:26.279 --> 00:28.303
After the release of "Finding Nemo,"...

00:28.425 --> 00:31.629
we found that there was quite a big increase...

00:31.746 --> 00:35.401
...in the number of people that wanted a clownfish as a pet.

00:35.636 --> 00:40.706
With the increase in demand, it did have an increase in captive breeding,...

00:41.059 --> 00:45.441
...but it also meant that more fish were being taken from the wild.

00:45.686 --> 00:50.545
Most collectors in Australia will use a very careful collecting measures.

00:50.969 --> 00:53.231
In other parts of the world, in Southeast Asia,...

00:53.353 --> 00:57.523
...they are using cyanide still to collect aquarium fish.

00:58.379 --> 00:59.554
Hmmm, that's not good.

01:00.616 --> 01:01.119
But there is hope.

01:01.697 --> 01:04.557
Matt and his team are working hard to breed blue tangs successfully.

01:04.793 --> 01:06.872
There's only one other tang species, the yellow tang,...

01:06.943 --> 01:09.038
...that's ever been raised in captivity before.

01:09.593 --> 01:12.023
And we're hoping that the blue tang will be the second.
