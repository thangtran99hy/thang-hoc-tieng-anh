The first tattoo I got was this little guy right here.

00:06.573 --> 00:09.332
It's based on this book that my whole family read,...

00:09.385 --> 00:10.412
...everyone's got it on their wrists.

00:10.463 --> 00:12.991
And it was right before I really had any tattoos...

00:13.190 --> 00:17.791
...and so I wanted to make sure that it wasn't visible, and so I put it down here.

00:18.298 --> 00:21.325
Basically it's about this seagull who wanted to be more than just a seagull.

00:22.235 --> 00:25.197
My favorite tattoo is probably my new one, I really like this one,...

00:25.287 --> 00:28.147
...took about three and a half hours, almost four hours.

00:28.260 --> 00:32.807
And the worst part about it is that I'd be like this for so long and it was just bad, uncomfortable.

00:33.127 --> 00:35.465
This one means a lot to me, it's my mom's eye.

00:35.697 --> 00:39.953
This is my mom's birthday, seems like I have a lot of stuff to do with my mom.

00:40.177 --> 00:41.605
Me and my dad got this one together.

00:42.515 --> 00:45.011
This is a G, it's for my boy.

00:45.225 --> 00:47.800
His daughter's name is Georgia, she has a brain condition.

00:47.871 --> 00:50.960
And so, I got that for him just to support him, let him know I got his back.

00:51.330 --> 00:54.805
This one's really cool, the story behind this one is, it's L L,..

00:55.105 --> 00:56.813
..stands for "my head's low to lifted up,"...

00:57.643 --> 01:00.711
...just to never keep your head low and always look for the better days.
