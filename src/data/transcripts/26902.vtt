You live on a planet that is mostly water.

00:02.659 --> 00:04.797
If you don't put water inside your body, you die.

00:05.036 --> 00:06.718
If you don't put it on the outside of your body,...

00:06.813 --> 00:09.907
...you get disgusting, gross diseases and your skin falls off.

00:10.274 --> 00:12.883
Some people fill giant bags with water and sleep on it.

00:13.573 --> 00:16.099
Sometimes, water just starts falling out of the sky.

00:16.780 --> 00:19.127
You think this model's hot but she's mostly just water.

00:19.649 --> 00:20.995
72% water.

00:22.896 --> 00:23.795
73% water.

00:24.779 --> 00:28.082
And smart people like this person said there's about to be even more water.

00:28.157 --> 00:30.320
There's about to be even more water.

00:30.647 --> 00:33.503
People think it's really funny to find water people don't want to be in...

00:33.968 --> 00:35.739
...and then push those people into that water.

00:36.384 --> 00:39.387
In fact, there are only two things you really can't live without:...

00:39.895 --> 00:41.300
...water and your phone.

00:42.023 --> 00:44.586
So, why in the world would you get a phone that can't get wet?

00:44.685 --> 00:45.227
Try again.

00:45.494 --> 00:48.177
The new water-resistant Galaxy S7 Edge.
