00:03.865 --> 00:05.598
ï»¿You may write me down in history...

00:06.060 --> 00:08.163
...with your bitter, twisted lies.

00:11.306 --> 00:13.284
You may trod me in the very dirt...

00:13.819 --> 00:16.269
...but still, like dust, I rise.

00:21.995 --> 00:24.071
Just like moons and like suns,...

00:24.435 --> 00:26.329
...with the certainty of tides,...

00:28.657 --> 00:30.559
...just like hopes springing high,...

00:31.043 --> 00:32.911
...still I rise.

00:36.205 --> 00:37.803
Did you want to see me broken,...

00:38.528 --> 00:40.578
...bowed head and lowered eyes?

00:41.223 --> 00:43.895
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,...

00:44.411 --> 00:47.067
...weaned by my soulful cries.

00:51.947 --> 00:54.795
Out of the huts of history's shame, I rise.

00:55.463 --> 00:58.735
Up from a past that's rooted in pain, I rise.

01:01.113 --> 01:04.189
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,...

01:04.684 --> 01:08.162
...welling and swelling I bear in the tide.

01:10.772 --> 01:16.335
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear, I rise.
