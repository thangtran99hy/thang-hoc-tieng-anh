00:01.109 --> 00:02.712
They said I was too pretty to fight.

00:03.241 --> 00:04.020
She can't fight.

00:04.078 --> 00:05.725
You're gonna mess up that beautiful face.

00:05.808 --> 00:07.221
They said I was too fat.

00:07.289 --> 00:09.473
They said my nose was too prominent.

00:09.525 --> 00:10.951
They said I was too masculine.

00:11.029 --> 00:12.801
They thought that catcalling was a compliment.

00:12.867 --> 00:15.355
He said, "You can fix those teeth quite easily."

00:15.426 --> 00:16.397
Boyish and ugly.

00:17.102 --> 00:19.273
When they were talking about "female," they weren't talking about me.

00:19.365 --> 00:20.531
This was not pretty.

00:20.613 --> 00:22.208
They would holler from across the street.

00:22.266 --> 00:23.339
Look sophisticated.

00:23.393 --> 00:24.471
Embarrassing nose.

00:24.523 --> 00:25.067
Too chubby.

00:25.125 --> 00:25.860
Was too skinny.

00:25.927 --> 00:26.358
Manly.

00:26.416 --> 00:27.159
Crazy hair.

00:27.217 --> 00:27.653
Never look good.

00:27.705 --> 00:28.029
Too wild.

00:28.083 --> 00:28.377
Too cute.

00:28.431 --> 00:28.960
Too beautiful.

00:29.014 --> 00:29.457
Too fat.

00:29.513 --> 00:29.873
He said.

00:29.925 --> 00:30.281
They said.

00:30.333 --> 00:30.735
She said.

00:30.888 --> 00:32.003
I said, "No way!"

00:32.540 --> 00:34.882
You aren't me. I'm me.

00:34.962 --> 00:37.801
I'm not gonna be defined by anyone's expectations.

00:37.992 --> 00:39.203
I don't dress my age.

00:39.459 --> 00:41.775
I dress myself the way I am.

00:42.099 --> 00:44.497
'Cause my face has nothing to do with my boxing.

00:44.733 --> 00:47.044
I'm ranked number one in the country and number two in the world.

00:47.209 --> 00:50.804
As a fashion blogger, my style is 100% unapologetic.

00:51.062 --> 00:52.381
I don't wanna change my teeth.

00:52.533 --> 00:53.149
This is me.

00:54.017 --> 00:54.948
This is my hair.

00:55.474 --> 00:56.161
My beauty.

00:56.305 --> 00:56.967
My beauty.

00:57.277 --> 00:57.867
My beauty.

00:58.137 --> 00:58.739
My say.
