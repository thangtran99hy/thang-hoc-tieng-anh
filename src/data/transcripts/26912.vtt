His heart will simply not have the strength in the Earth's gravity.

00:04.163 --> 00:06.228
Bones will be brittle.

00:06.352 --> 00:08.669
He wouldn't even survive the trip back to Earth.

00:08.941 --> 00:11.182
So the child remains classified, on Mars?

00:11.516 --> 00:11.993
Yes.

00:17.114 --> 00:19.085
I've got so many questions about Mars.

00:19.315 --> 00:21.135
Not as many as I have about Earth.

00:21.634 --> 00:23.109
There's so many colors.

00:24.110 --> 00:24.812
Can I stay?

00:25.171 --> 00:26.737
They need to do more tests.

00:27.985 --> 00:29.113
Nothing's changed.

00:29.659 --> 00:30.962
I want to be out there.

00:32.425 --> 00:33.492
There's been a breach!

00:33.899 --> 00:37.254
We need teams in the airport, Amtrak station!

00:37.428 --> 00:38.651
He can't survive.

00:39.371 --> 00:40.667
He's running out of time.

00:41.295 --> 00:44.174
I was scared I wouldn't know how to be human.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.523
You made me human.

00:47.341 --> 00:50.449
Tulsa, what's your favorite thing about Earth?

00:52.933 --> 00:53.997
You are, Gardner.
