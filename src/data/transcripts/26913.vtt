You mean I have to wash my hands every day...

00:03.212 --> 00:04.936
...to get rid of the germs that can make me sick?

00:05.335 --> 00:08.572
Sheesh, you have to wash your hands more than once a day!

00:08.751 --> 00:14.229
Germs hide in all kinds of places like cellphones, pets, countertops, doorknobs,...

00:14.407 --> 00:16.006
...and of course, in the bathroom too.

00:17.004 --> 00:20.644
So, you're telling me pretty much anything we touch...

00:20.729 --> 00:22.754
...can have bacteria and viruses on them?

00:23.027 --> 00:25.605
And those germs can get onto your hands?

00:26.063 --> 00:29.027
Then, into your body through your mouth and nose to make you sick.

00:29.265 --> 00:29.975
Makes sense.

00:30.339 --> 00:33.849
That's why it's so important to wash your hands often throughout the day.

00:34.581 --> 00:36.983
Especially after using the bathroom and before eating.

00:37.123 --> 00:39.261
And don't forget after blowing your nose or coughing.

00:39.679 --> 00:42.363
Spit and snot aren't the only things that can fly out...

00:42.533 --> 00:44.025
...and tissues don't catch it all.

00:45.001 --> 00:46.789
I guess you can never get rid of germs...

00:46.987 --> 00:48.787
...but you can outsmart them by washing your hands.

00:49.251 --> 00:51.061
Even you can be smarter than any germ.

00:52.765 --> 00:54.526
It's you we need to worry about.

00:55.379 --> 00:57.479
It's not enough just to wash your hands often.

00:58.021 --> 00:59.679
You need to do a good job of it, too.

01:00.317 --> 01:03.095
You have to scrub your hands well if you want to wash away the germs...

01:03.273 --> 01:04.585
...because they like to hide.
