ï»¿I have a half a billion germs I keep as tiny pets.

00:13.381 --> 00:17.286
They're cute and clean and never mean and give me no regrets.

00:17.571 --> 00:21.175
They spend all day engaged in play upon my skin and hair.

00:21.441 --> 00:25.291
They're on my clothes, between my toes and in my underwear.

00:25.605 --> 00:27.493
They dance and shout and bounce about.

00:27.602 --> 00:29.263
They run and jump and slide.

00:29.538 --> 00:33.358
My epidermis teems with germs who party on my hide.

00:49.361 --> 00:53.151
I never fret about the pets inside my shirt and socks.

00:53.394 --> 00:57.121
I love them there but wonder where they keep their litter box.

00:57.334 --> 01:01.101
I never fret about the pets inside my shirt and socks.

01:01.353 --> 01:05.265
I love them there but wonder where they keep their litter box.
