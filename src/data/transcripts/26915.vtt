ï»¿This is BammBamm.

00:03.606 --> 00:04.590
He's a babirusa.

00:05.396 --> 00:07.061
Yes, that is a real animal.

00:09.341 --> 00:12.385
A member of the pig family, this prehistoric-looking creature...

00:12.532 --> 00:15.607
...is native to the small Indonesian island of Sulawesi.

00:17.657 --> 00:20.543
In males, the upper canine teeth grow straight up...

00:20.693 --> 00:24.497
...through the flesh of its own snout and curve back towards their eyes.

00:25.855 --> 00:29.201
As they get older, the tusks can get spectacularly large,...

00:29.453 --> 00:33.616
...and on rare occasions, have grown so big as to pierce their own skulls.

00:36.218 --> 00:38.887
Babirusas spend much of their time foraging for food,...

00:39.404 --> 00:43.439
...eating everything from roots, leaves and fruits, to meat and grubs.

00:44.641 --> 00:48.461
His strong jaws are easily capable of cracking the hardest of nuts.

00:49.641 --> 00:53.431
In its native island home, the babirusa has no natural predators,...

00:53.861 --> 00:58.043
...but overhunting and conversion of their rainforest habitat to farmland...

00:58.305 --> 01:02.007
...has reduced their wild population to less than a few thousand.

01:03.394 --> 01:05.009
This is the babirusa.
