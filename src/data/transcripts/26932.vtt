I'm going to tell you a story about a car built for individuals.

00:12.479 --> 00:17.424
But the story is driven by you with actual tweets you sent to Jimmy Fallon.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.087
Here goes.

00:22.343 --> 00:24.965
Adina was going to someone else's wedding.

00:25.389 --> 00:26.987
Girl, today's your lucky day.

00:27.489 --> 00:31.638
She picked up a German hitchhiker, who came to America to study farming.

00:32.142 --> 00:32.871
How charming.

00:35.076 --> 00:39.391
Discussing their mutual love for sweaters, they drove past an alpaca farm.

00:41.707 --> 00:43.289
It's the Alpacalypse!

00:45.763 --> 00:48.394
Then they got stopped by some turtles crossing the road,...

00:50.202 --> 00:52.615
...next to some guys with a PhD in leather.

00:53.024 --> 00:54.263
Oh, soft!

00:56.308 --> 00:58.675
And then they drove through a movie set in Palmdale,...

00:59.491 --> 01:01.882
...ruining the best performance of an alien ever.

01:03.495 --> 01:03.913
Really?

01:06.801 --> 01:08.937
Ah, the tweets and turns of life.

01:09.521 --> 01:11.767
You may be surprised where they can take you.

01:12.556 --> 01:15.028
The road is full of love.

01:23.473 --> 01:25.699
This was a story that started with you...

01:26.263 --> 01:27.887
...because luxury always should.
