If, all of a sudden, we see JP Morgan and all these different big financial companies...

00:05.743 --> 00:08.330
...say, you know what, we're just moving everybody to Berlin.

00:09.939 --> 00:12.186
Now, there's a tangible impact on jobs...

00:12.473 --> 00:14.211
...and that's gonna influence the conversation.

00:14.620 --> 00:18.491
And it's the same in the United States once we see that...

00:18.790 --> 00:23.371
...we're talking about this nationalism, Trump versus Senator Clinton...

00:23.432 --> 00:24.518
...or Secretary of State Clinton.

00:25.291 --> 00:28.459
If all these businesses are reacting to...

00:28.761 --> 00:31.243
...this "Take Back Our Country" movement by leaving.

00:31.820 --> 00:33.775
That sets the tone for the election as well.

00:34.124 --> 00:36.157
Look, if it happened that all these companies said we're out,...

00:36.951 --> 00:38.237
...why would it be any different here?

00:38.475 --> 00:42.215
But, on the flip side, if the United States is open...

00:42.581 --> 00:46.184
...and we adhere to our treaties then, all of a sudden,...

00:46.920 --> 00:51.134
...tech companies, in particular in the UK, who want to be able to work...

00:51.231 --> 00:55.015
...with the European Union and have the treaties already in place,...

00:55.505 --> 00:56.357
...they might come here.
