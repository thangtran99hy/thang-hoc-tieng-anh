Car's all yours.

00:01.223 --> 00:01.593
Thanks!

00:01.880 --> 00:03.945
Cars.com's expert reviews made it easy but...

00:04.103 --> 00:05.426
Shouldn't there be more back and forth?

00:05.618 --> 00:06.489
You miss the drama, right?

00:06.586 --> 00:06.936
Yeah!

00:07.583 --> 00:08.423
Maybe this will do the trick.

00:10.021 --> 00:11.263
It's a puppy!

00:11.337 --> 00:11.817
Not a puppy,...

00:11.917 --> 00:12.365
...a wolf.

00:12.676 --> 00:12.907
What now?

00:13.113 --> 00:13.478
He's a wolf...

00:14.001 --> 00:15.742
...and that is his incredibly protective mother.

00:20.487 --> 00:21.409
Put the wolf down.

00:22.617 --> 00:23.042
You guys good?

00:23.426 --> 00:23.714
Yeah, we're good.

00:25.101 --> 00:27.001
Get the right car without all the drama.

00:27.378 --> 00:28.043
Cars.com

00:28.397 --> 00:29.067
All drive,...

00:29.286 --> 00:29.779
...no drama.
