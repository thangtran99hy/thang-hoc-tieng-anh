ï»¿I am an electrician.

00:06.290 --> 00:08.590
I work with electricity.

00:09.455 --> 00:12.721
I am needed in every place.

00:13.024 --> 00:14.925
Be it a village or city.

00:16.080 --> 00:21.667
Electrical things of all kinds, for you I install.

00:22.742 --> 00:27.779
Fans and lamps, bells and speakers and television on the wall.

00:29.734 --> 00:35.538
Circuits, meters, switches and plugs and electrical wires.

00:36.189 --> 00:39.299
I fix these and maintain them,...

00:39.773 --> 00:42.012
...preventing shocks and fires.

00:44.226 --> 00:49.849
A drill and screws, a screwdriver, a voltage tester pen...

00:50.447 --> 00:55.957
...are some tools that you may know, but I use more than ten.

00:56.713 --> 01:02.247
Electricity is a treasure, save it as much as you can.

01:02.821 --> 01:08.429
When not in use, always turn off every switch, light and fan.
