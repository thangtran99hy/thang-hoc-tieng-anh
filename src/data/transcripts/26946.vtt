ï»¿Hiya, Larry!

00:02.361 --> 00:04.500
It looks like you're carrying too many packages...

00:04.916 --> 00:06.924
...and they haven't been loaded very well.

00:07.588 --> 00:08.675
Shall we take a look?

00:09.771 --> 00:11.784
Go, go, mechanicals!

00:14.304 --> 00:16.260
What a mess, I'm really sorry.

00:16.645 --> 00:18.899
But that's no way to pack a lorry.

00:21.460 --> 00:23.335
Let's take some time and care with it.

00:23.879 --> 00:26.589
I'm sure we'll make these boxes fit.

00:29.103 --> 00:32.438
The biggest parcel should go in first.

00:34.711 --> 00:37.573
Put the smallest one on top.

00:40.157 --> 00:42.733
That blue parcel on the left.

00:45.087 --> 00:47.411
And the red one on the right.

00:49.710 --> 00:53.113
Let's put this parcel in the gap up at the top.

00:55.399 --> 00:59.473
And put the last parcel in that gap down at the bottom.

01:02.716 --> 01:03.157
There!

01:03.588 --> 01:04.642
All sorted.

01:10.021 --> 01:14.349
Now that everything is packed away neatly, it all fits in properly.
