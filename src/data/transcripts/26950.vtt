00:12.812 --> 00:14.436
Yes, I can,...

00:14.595 --> 00:17.120
...suddenly, yes, I can.

00:17.621 --> 00:22.003
"Gee, I'm afraid to go on" has turned into, "Yes, I can"

00:22.417 --> 00:26.679
Take a look, what do you see?

00:27.049 --> 00:30.553
A hundred and thirty-three pounds of confidence me.

00:31.247 --> 00:34.501
Got the feeling I can do anything.

00:34.863 --> 00:35.980
Yes, I can.

00:36.614 --> 00:39.555
Something that sings in my blood is telling me,...

00:39.735 --> 00:40.756
..."Yes, I can."

00:41.553 --> 00:43.972
I was just born today.

00:44.023 --> 00:46.248
I can go all the way.

00:46.309 --> 00:51.923
Yes, I can.

00:52.494 --> 00:54.652
No, you can't.

00:56.285 --> 00:57.173
Yes, I can.

00:57.453 --> 00:58.065
Are you ready?

00:58.129 --> 01:00.473
I can climb Everest.

01:00.999 --> 01:01.849
Yes, I can.

01:02.784 --> 01:05.271
I can fight here all night and never rest.

01:05.790 --> 01:06.758
Yes, I can.

01:07.707 --> 01:10.071
I was just born today.

01:10.155 --> 01:12.680
I can go all the way.

01:12.758 --> 01:26.144
Yes, I can.
