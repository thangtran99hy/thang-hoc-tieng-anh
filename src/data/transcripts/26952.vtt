Remember, physical contact or displays of feeling are a danger to all of us.

00:07.645 --> 00:10.164
Let's do our part to help contain this disease.

00:14.069 --> 00:15.114
Did anybody see that?

00:15.473 --> 00:16.242
Anyone recognize him?

00:16.658 --> 00:18.292
That's our first jumper in a while.

00:23.713 --> 00:26.195
I've been watching you, the way you look at the world,...

00:27.144 --> 00:29.113
...the way you experience things, it's different.

00:29.340 --> 00:29.926
This has to stop.

00:30.281 --> 00:32.040
If it continues, I'll be forced to report you.

00:36.198 --> 00:38.766
I can't stay away from you, I can't not be around you.

00:38.945 --> 00:40.765
Do you realize what would happen if anyone saw us?

00:41.255 --> 00:41.918
It can't happen.

00:42.732 --> 00:43.249
You know that.

00:44.577 --> 00:45.936
Do not risk your job.

00:46.041 --> 00:47.818
Do not risk your life.

00:54.608 --> 00:56.016
Just remember what this feels like.
