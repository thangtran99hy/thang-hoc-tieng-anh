00:13.543 --> 00:15.506
Using something called augmented reality,...

00:15.611 --> 00:19.638

00:19.777 --> 00:22.960
...by accessing your smartphone's GPS, clock and camera,...

00:23.305 --> 00:26.379
...making it possible for Pokemon characters to appear...

00:26.440 --> 00:29.267
...in your house, neighborhood or anywhere in real time.

00:29.597 --> 00:32.341
