00:03.440 --> 00:04.216
ï»¿What the hell is this?

00:09.077 --> 00:09.761
They're boarding us.

00:14.243 --> 00:14.889
Abandon ship!

00:18.487 --> 00:19.137
My god!

00:26.218 --> 00:27.364
I know why you're here,...

00:27.911 --> 00:28.834
...why we are all here.

00:30.393 --> 00:31.741
Our captain will come for us.

00:31.989 --> 00:33.975
Mercy will be the last thing on his mind.

00:34.759 --> 00:37.403
I am counting on it.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.829
Fear of death is illogical.

00:47.717 --> 00:50.332
Fear of death is what keeps us alive.

00:54.039 --> 00:55.881
Everyone who goes there, he kills.

00:55.955 --> 00:56.971
That's our friends out there.

00:58.053 --> 00:59.199
We cannot just leave them behind.

00:59.816 --> 01:01.766
Unity is not your strength.

01:02.313 --> 01:03.258
It's a weakness.

01:03.826 --> 01:05.707
I think you're underestimating humanity.

01:06.171 --> 01:07.295
Hold on to something!

01:10.341 --> 01:11.118
Fire at will.

01:11.895 --> 01:12.178
Do it!

01:12.321 --> 01:12.703
Do it!
