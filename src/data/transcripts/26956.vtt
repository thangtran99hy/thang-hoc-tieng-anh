00:17.319 --> 00:21.703
So, what is the appeal of an Ivy League education and why are these schools so powerful?

00:22.327 --> 00:25.609
Well, the Ivy League is synonymous with elitism and prestige,...

00:25.992 --> 00:29.139

00:29.715 --> 00:32.334
The origin of "Ivy League" is still a matter of debate.

00:32.761 --> 00:37.698

00:44.744 --> 00:46.316
...in the Northeast United States.

00:49.166 --> 00:52.095

00:52.371 --> 00:54.803
...demanding curriculum, slim acceptance rates,...

00:55.053 --> 00:56.882
...and enormous financial endowments.
