00:00.162 --> 00:02.674
Microsoft is making its biggest acquisition ever:...

00:03.037 --> 00:05.865
...a 26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn.

00:06.561 --> 00:07.961
You probably know about LinkedIn.

00:08.326 --> 00:10.540
It's the social networking site for professionals...

00:10.813 --> 00:12.769
...where you can keep track of your business contacts.

00:13.363 --> 00:14.951
You can also look for a job on the site...

00:15.280 --> 00:19.447
...or a manager or supervisor can post a job, and find someone to fill it on the site.

00:20.503 --> 00:22.214
Why would Microsoft want LinkedIn?

00:22.884 --> 00:24.447
There are some potential synergies.

00:25.206 --> 00:28.625
Microsoft Office 365 with Word, Outlook...

00:28.711 --> 00:31.433
...and other programs is the dominant Office suite...

00:32.220 --> 00:35.573
...so you could imagine LinkedIn messaging and content integrated throughout.

00:36.705 --> 00:40.983
LinkedIn is not only growing its user base which is about 430 million right now.

00:41.422 --> 00:45.249
It also has a growing sales, learning and advertising business.

00:46.037 --> 00:49.639
Analysts are forecasting fiscal year revenue of 3.7 billion.

00:50.312 --> 00:53.581
That's an increase of about 25 percent year-over-year.

00:54.709 --> 00:58.921
Microsoft could convince Office customers to let LinkedIn learning courses...

00:59.041 --> 01:02.967
...teach its employees new skills and let its employment services...

01:03.047 --> 01:04.317
...handle job openings.
