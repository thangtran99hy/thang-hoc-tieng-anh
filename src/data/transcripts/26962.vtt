00:00.511 --> 00:03.172
It's a suit that looks fit for a superhero,...

00:03.978 --> 00:06.375
...complete with flashing lights and goggles,...

00:06.900 --> 00:10.126
...but this exoskeleton doesn't give the wearer super strength.

00:10.531 --> 00:12.493
I'm gonna walk really slow.

00:13.117 --> 00:15.316
It simulates what it's like to grow old.

00:16.179 --> 00:19.771
Genworth sellers of long-term care insurance came up with the idea.

00:20.469 --> 00:22.437
No one really wants to talk about getting older,...

00:22.879 --> 00:28.156
...so this experience is the tactical way to get the conversation started naturally.

00:29.637 --> 00:31.713
And not just with the senior set.

00:31.986 --> 00:36.632
Displaying the suit at places like the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, New Jersey...

00:36.961 --> 00:38.712
...gives kids something to think about.

00:39.321 --> 00:42.713
The headset simulates what it's like to have vision disorders...

00:42.774 --> 00:45.251
...like glaucoma and macular degeneration...

00:45.491 --> 00:48.088
And when those cells begin to go, this is what you're left with.

00:48.477 --> 00:50.172
Can you imagine walking around like this, Kristen?

00:50.766 --> 00:51.756
No.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.676
...as well as hearing impairment.

00:54.999 --> 00:59.346
The extra weight on your back and mechanical resistance applied by the suit...

00:59.735 --> 01:02.589
...brings home the reality of living with the muscle loss...

01:02.680 --> 01:04.645
...and arthritis common in the elderly.
