00:01.703 --> 00:06.787
I became fascinated by the distinction between success and mastery.

00:07.240 --> 00:11.376
And when I heard about a set of archers up at Columbia,...

00:11.657 --> 00:13.009
I decided to go visit them...

00:13.309 --> 00:16.343
...because I wanted to understand what's called "target panic,"...

00:16.580 --> 00:18.595
...what happens when you get almost too good.

00:19.052 --> 00:23.128
And I stayed for three hours at this practice not expecting to...

00:23.190 --> 00:27.019
...because I was witnessing this distinction between success and mastery.

00:27.546 --> 00:34.252
I would see these archers, go up to shoot at a target that's 150 yards away,...

00:34.522 --> 00:41.347
...unable to really do anything but reframe their sense of success in every moment,...

00:41.972 --> 00:47.379
...seeing themselves as an archer who just hit a 9 but knows they can really hit a 10,...

00:47.789 --> 00:51.138
...who just hit a 7 knows they can really hit a 9 and so on.

00:51.207 --> 00:56.397
And it's a taxing pursuit but it occurred to me as I was watching them...

00:56.450 --> 00:59.509
...that success is the ability to hit that 10 ring once...

00:59.971 --> 01:05.313
...but mastery is the ability to know that it means nothing if you can't do it again and again.
