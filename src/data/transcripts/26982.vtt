There are more than 7,000 spoken languages in the world,...

00:03.263 --> 00:07.991
...but nearly half the population speaks one of just 12 as their first language.

00:08.375 --> 00:11.269
As a matter of fact, more than three-quarters of all languages...

00:11.631 --> 00:13.645
...are only spoken by a small number of people.
