00:08.624 --> 00:12.387
Heart beats fast,...

00:12.623 --> 00:17.311
...colors and promises.

00:17.475 --> 00:19.963
How to be brave,...

00:20.211 --> 00:27.583
...how can I love when I'm afraid to fall?

00:27.859 --> 00:32.825
But watching you stand alone,...

00:33.179 --> 00:40.931
...all of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow.

00:42.107 --> 00:49.177
One step closer.

00:49.795 --> 00:54.679
I have died every day waiting for you.

00:54.986 --> 00:59.586
Darling don't be afraid, I have loved you...

00:59.719 --> 01:03.438
...for a thousand years.

01:03.756 --> 01:09.713
I'll love you for a thousand more.
