ï»¿And keys to your heart?

00:01.429 --> 00:04.817
Well, no, they're actually all the keys to the time machines that I have at home.

00:05.134 --> 00:06.703
Great! And what is that?

00:06.841 --> 00:08.160
The lock in the diary?

00:08.479 --> 00:09.721
Well, this is a Tamagotchi.

00:09.789 --> 00:12.569
It's been my tech contribution for this year's Met Gala.

00:13.034 --> 00:14.834
It's humble but it's tech.

00:14.931 --> 00:17.039
I love your eye makeup and I love your dark lips.

00:17.124 --> 00:19.364
I dyed my brows about 45 minutes ago.

00:19.437 --> 00:20.131
Oh, how brilliant!

00:20.220 --> 00:22.893
My stylist Leslie was having a panic attack.

00:23.038 --> 00:25.083
Had to drink two tequilas, she's just like, "What are you doing?"

00:25.154 --> 00:26.693
I'm like, "Trust me, trust me, trust me."

00:27.085 --> 00:27.859
I love this.

00:27.968 --> 00:28.673
Thank you very much.

00:28.743 --> 00:30.367
You had this already or it came tonight?

00:30.663 --> 00:32.063
No, it came tonight, it's all custom.

00:32.550 --> 00:33.183
Prada!

00:33.409 --> 00:34.302
Love the gloves.

00:34.408 --> 00:35.151
Love the gloves.

00:35.251 --> 00:35.705
Thank you.

00:35.811 --> 00:36.365
Love the gloves.

00:36.481 --> 00:37.147
Are you gonna have fun?

00:37.824 --> 00:39.073
I'm gonna have fun. I'm gonna have a ball.

00:39.160 --> 00:39.661
A ball?

00:39.753 --> 00:40.019
That's right.

00:40.107 --> 00:40.569
Have fun!
