00:00.259 --> 00:05.222
ï»¿I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves.

00:10.517 --> 00:16.919
And I watch my daughters, two beautiful, intelligent, black young women,...

00:17.798 --> 00:20.047
...playing with their dogs on the White House lawn.

00:26.329 --> 00:33.171
And because of Hillary Clinton, my daughters and all our sons and daughters...

00:34.036 --> 00:38.466
...now take for granted that a woman can be president of the United States.

00:43.518 --> 00:50.355
So, don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great,...

00:51.165 --> 00:54.077
...that somehow we need to make it great again...

00:54.787 --> 00:58.428
...because this, right now, is the greatest country on Earth.
