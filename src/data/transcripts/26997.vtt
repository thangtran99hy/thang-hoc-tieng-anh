Friends, delegates and fellow Americans,...

00:05.981 --> 00:11.952
...I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination...

00:12.393 --> 00:15.348
...for the presidency of the United States.

00:16.571 --> 00:19.917
Together, we will lead our party back to the White House,...

00:20.435 --> 00:27.340
...and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity and peace.

00:27.445 --> 00:31.039
My plan will begin with safety at home,...

00:31.813 --> 00:35.470
...which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders...

00:35.885 --> 00:37.923
...and protection from terrorism.

00:38.925 --> 00:44.687
There can be no prosperity without law and order.

00:45.516 --> 00:52.741
My message is that things have to change, and they have to change right now.

00:53.211 --> 00:56.742
We will make America strong again.

00:58.899 --> 01:02.256
We will make America proud again.

01:03.819 --> 01:07.158
We will make America safe again,...

01:09.598 --> 01:12.843
...and we will make America great again.

01:13.329 --> 01:15.668
God bless you and good night.

01:16.007 --> 01:16.745
I love you!
