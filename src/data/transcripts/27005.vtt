ï»¿Meet Boyan.

00:01.626 --> 00:06.852
One day, when he went diving at sea, he noticed more plastic bags than fish.

00:07.333 --> 00:09.828
Plastic bags and other trash left behind...

00:10.123 --> 00:12.963
...end up in rivers and travel to the open water.

00:13.467 --> 00:18.492
There, currents push the trash around and concentrate it in huge areas.

00:19.033 --> 00:23.201
The trash gets eaten by animals, so it even makes its way back to us.

00:23.779 --> 00:27.665
Boyan wondered, "How can we get all this plastic out of the ocean?"

00:28.351 --> 00:30.595
This was the start of "The Ocean Cleanup."

00:31.313 --> 00:32.762
When Boyan was 17,...

00:33.035 --> 00:36.529
...he came up with a plan for an installation to clean our oceans.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.336
After presenting this,...

00:38.605 --> 00:42.670
...he gained the support of a hundred scientists, engineers and volunteers,...

00:43.012 --> 00:46.175
...who together established that the concept is feasible.

00:46.789 --> 00:47.815
This is how it works.

00:48.247 --> 00:51.615
The trash floats towards a hundred kilometer wide barrier.

00:52.173 --> 00:54.399
Sea life safely passes underneath,...

00:54.860 --> 00:57.516
...while the current pushes the plastic towards the centre.

00:58.160 --> 01:01.250
Here a conveyor belt and a pump scoop up the plastic.

01:01.813 --> 01:05.679
A ship comes by every six weeks to pick up the trash for recycling.
