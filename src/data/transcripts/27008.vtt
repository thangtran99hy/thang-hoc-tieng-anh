There are some shark species that seem to do okay in aquariums.

00:03.604 --> 00:07.091
You'll see a lot of nurse sharks, zebra sharks, some reef sharks...

00:07.152 --> 00:10.032
...and sand tiger sharks, but not the great white.

00:10.490 --> 00:14.781
For decades, aquariums have tried to contain the world's largest predatory fish.

00:15.054 --> 00:18.204
Institutions like Marineland, SeaWorld and the Steinhart Aquarium...

00:18.270 --> 00:21.769
...repeatedly took in white sharks during the 1970s, 80s and 90s,...

00:22.012 --> 00:25.428
...at times drawing huge crowds, but they never lasted long.

00:25.889 --> 00:27.092
Some needed help swimming.

00:27.525 --> 00:28.448
None of them would eat.

00:28.801 --> 00:31.407
The longest one lasted was just 16 days.

00:31.731 --> 00:34.619
A 1984 report by the Steinhart Aquarium put it this way:...

00:35.158 --> 00:37.799
..."In most cases, it could be said that all of these captive sharks...

00:37.862 --> 00:41.867
...were merely in the process of dying, with some taking longer than others."

00:42.465 --> 00:46.639
They had constructed an elaborate transport tank with a harness and IV fluids...

00:46.748 --> 00:48.515
...but still couldn't keep the sharks alive.

00:49.467 --> 00:52.652
It wasn't until 2004 that the Monterey Bay Aquarium...

00:52.846 --> 00:56.897
...proved that it was possible to keep white sharks for at least six months.

00:57.346 --> 01:00.635
It took a massive effort, and no one's done it since.
