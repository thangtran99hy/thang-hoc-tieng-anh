00:04.729 --> 00:06.227
ï»¿Look at all the bottles.

00:06.543 --> 00:07.789
Better for syrup.

00:09.190 --> 00:11.549
This one is strawberry syrup, look it.

00:14.183 --> 00:15.240
It's fizzy.

00:18.235 --> 00:19.441
I want some mint syrup.

00:20.319 --> 00:20.811
Hey!

00:21.536 --> 00:22.491
I want to taste it.

00:25.730 --> 00:28.389
It doesn't smell like mint, here smell it.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.056
It smells good, let's taste.

00:33.711 --> 00:34.383
Me first.

00:34.889 --> 00:35.836
No, me first.

00:36.067 --> 00:38.278
Okay, okay calm down kids.

00:38.815 --> 00:39.829
What are you doing?

00:41.054 --> 00:42.964
Put those bottles down right away.

00:43.942 --> 00:45.622
What kind of syrup is this mom?

00:45.679 --> 00:46.429
Can we have some?

00:46.838 --> 00:51.841
Absolutely not! That's not syrup at all, it's liquid I use to clean the floor.

00:52.119 --> 00:52.872
Yuck!

00:53.377 --> 00:57.241
And if you drink it, even a little bit of it, it can make you very sick.

00:57.533 --> 00:58.410
Huh?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.581
So you see, you have to be very careful.

01:01.850 --> 01:05.137
Things that look like they might taste good can often be dangerous.
