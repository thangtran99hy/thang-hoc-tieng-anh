00:00.233 --> 00:01.945
ï»¿I am not a vegetarian.

00:02.092 --> 00:02.857
Look at these teeth.

00:03.027 --> 00:04.050
They're made for meat!

00:04.430 --> 00:06.517
Do I look like I'm stalking plants?

00:07.477 --> 00:09.881
Most dry foods add plant protein like gluten.

00:10.092 --> 00:11.607
But Iams never adds gluten.

00:11.774 --> 00:14.066
Iams adds 50% more animal protein.

00:14.469 --> 00:15.575
Look at this body.

00:15.669 --> 00:19.289
Under this shiny coat is a lean, mean, purring machine.

00:19.605 --> 00:20.450
I am, too.

00:21.898 --> 00:24.663
Iams, with 50% more animal protein.

00:25.041 --> 00:25.688
Yum!

00:25.996 --> 00:26.904
I'm an Iams cat.

00:27.275 --> 00:28.468
Feed me what I'm born to eat.
