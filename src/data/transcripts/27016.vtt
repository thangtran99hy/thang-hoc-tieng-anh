You've been eye guzzling that show for 58 episodes.

00:05.465 --> 00:07.569
Oh god, there they are:...

00:08.018 --> 00:10.403
...the final, final credits.

00:10.972 --> 00:13.425
Your favorite show is over.

00:14.255 --> 00:18.291
You've fallen into a show hole.

00:19.461 --> 00:21.949
Your TV life is ruined.

00:22.792 --> 00:28.593
Hopeless, showless, the struggle could not be more real.

00:29.335 --> 00:33.806
Might as well put your TV on Craigslist under "Free Stuff" and go die.

00:34.797 --> 00:38.369
Then, you see it: salvation.

00:39.163 --> 00:45.367
Because with Amazon Fire TV's vast library from Netflix, HBO and Hulu,...

00:46.925 --> 00:51.922
...your new favorite show is waiting for you, smiling.

00:53.533 --> 00:55.813
So long, show hole!
