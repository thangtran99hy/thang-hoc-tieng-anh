00:02.203 --> 00:03.732
Tonight I can write the saddest lines,...

00:06.077 --> 00:06.979
...like for example,...

00:07.726 --> 00:10.342
..."the night is shattered and the blue stars shiver in a distance."

00:11.931 --> 00:13.992
"The night wind revolves in the sky and sings."

00:15.418 --> 00:16.993
Tonight I can write the saddest lines.

00:18.559 --> 00:21.045
I loved her and sometimes, she loved me too.

00:25.694 --> 00:28.140
Through nights like this one, I held her in my arms.

00:29.248 --> 00:31.801
I kissed her again and again under the yellow sky.

00:33.397 --> 00:35.695
She loved me and sometimes, I loved her too.

00:37.279 --> 00:39.416
How could one not have loved her great, still eyes?

00:40.789 --> 00:42.489
Tonight I can write the saddest lines.

00:46.027 --> 00:47.519
To think that I do not have her,...

00:48.693 --> 00:49.838
...to feel that I have lost her,...

00:51.740 --> 00:54.267
...to hear the immense night, still more immense without her,...

00:55.263 --> 00:57.885
...and the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.
