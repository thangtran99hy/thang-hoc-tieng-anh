ï»¿Do you know where fish live?

00:04.198 --> 00:07.399
That's right, fish live underwater.

00:08.297 --> 00:10.719
"How can they do that?", I hear you ask.

00:11.056 --> 00:14.288
Well, it's because fish have gills.

00:14.925 --> 00:19.457
Fish use their gills to suck up water and extract oxygen.

00:23.825 --> 00:26.035
Just like how we breathe in air.

00:28.179 --> 00:35.715
Fish have fins and tails that go whoosh, whoosh, whoosh,...

00:39.554 --> 00:42.383
...so they can swim really well.
