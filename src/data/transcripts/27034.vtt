00:04.231 --> 00:06.505
We spend a lot of time in relationships...

00:06.675 --> 00:08.798
...pointing out what's wrong with the other person...

00:08.988 --> 00:11.126
...and insisting on our blamelessness.

00:12.124 --> 00:14.674
We imagine that's a good strategy for getting what we want...

00:15.309 --> 00:19.270
...and for being happy in a couple, but that's nonsense.

00:19.933 --> 00:21.425
Next time you feel strong enough that you can,...

00:21.485 --> 00:25.937
...for a moment, stop insisting you're always right.

00:26.226 --> 00:27.295
Try a different tack.

00:28.252 --> 00:32.019
Out of the blue, say, "Sorry I'm so anxious."

00:32.585 --> 00:34.411
"Sorry I lose my temper."

00:34.645 --> 00:36.284
"Sorry I don't listen enough."

00:36.510 --> 00:38.493
"Sorry I'm too preoccupied."

00:38.667 --> 00:41.732
"Sorry I both want you close and push you away."

00:41.975 --> 00:45.179
"Sorry I'm not always balanced, sane or mature."

00:47.144 --> 00:51.421
You think that might weaken you, make you hostage to the partner's vengeance.

00:52.453 --> 00:53.381
It never does.

00:53.827 --> 00:56.844
Everything always gets better from that point.

00:57.633 --> 00:58.340
Give it a try.

00:59.352 --> 01:00.852
Sorry I'm so crazy.
