00:02.827 --> 00:04.263
ï»¿My name is Margot Robbie.

00:05.996 --> 00:07.309
I'm 25 years old.

00:08.261 --> 00:10.255
I believe in taking care of myself.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.979
I can't remember the last time I washed my hair.

00:16.242 --> 00:17.939
It basically cleans itself now.

00:20.812 --> 00:24.601
Then, I apply a proprietary glycolic and pearl mask,...

00:24.934 --> 00:28.661
...which I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine.

00:31.689 --> 00:34.735
There is an idea of Margot Robbie,...

00:34.941 --> 00:36.810
...some kind of abstraction,...

00:37.345 --> 00:41.197
...but there is no real me, only an entity.

00:41.569 --> 00:43.005
Something illusory.

00:45.214 --> 00:47.351
And though I can hide my cold gaze...

00:47.425 --> 00:50.941
...and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours,...

00:51.038 --> 00:54.823
...and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable,...

00:57.867 --> 01:00.603
...I simply am not there.

01:05.980 --> 01:06.859
I'm here.
