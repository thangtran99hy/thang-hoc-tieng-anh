00:01.489 --> 00:04.597
From AAAs to CCs and downgrades,...

00:04.770 --> 00:09.060
...the ratings agencies headed by Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch...

00:09.217 --> 00:12.027
...are controversial players on the world economic stage.

00:12.125 --> 00:15.524
Their adjudications based on discussions with financial administrators...

00:15.598 --> 00:18.509
...and meetings of ratings committees can have a significant effect...

00:18.599 --> 00:21.769
...on a country or company standing in the financial community,...

00:21.904 --> 00:24.765
...based as they are on political and economic factors.

00:25.111 --> 00:27.571
While, in theory, these assessments are apolitical,...

00:27.728 --> 00:29.605
...they can heavily influence investors,...

00:29.678 --> 00:32.359
...informing them of the risks they'll be exposing themselves to,...

00:32.448 --> 00:36.795
...and whether the country in question is able or willing to repay its debts.

00:37.019 --> 00:40.213
A country's rating can be downgraded due to a variety of factors...

00:40.311 --> 00:41.721
...like worrying growth potential...

00:41.801 --> 00:44.989
...or a general inability to implement an efficient austerity plan,...

00:45.110 --> 00:47.661
...as is the case in several European countries.

00:47.843 --> 00:50.469
And once a country's credit rating has been downgraded,...

00:50.570 --> 00:53.545
...it, in turn, means an increase in interest rates for that country...

00:53.682 --> 00:54.837
...when it comes to borrowing,...

00:54.979 --> 00:57.530
...making it even more expensive to pay off its debts.

00:57.684 --> 01:01.168
Most of the countries rated pay the agencies to grade their debt standing.

01:01.331 --> 01:04.687
This represents up to 90% of the agencies' revenues.
