Project Bloks is a research project,...

00:02.621 --> 00:04.989
...and our goal is to create an open hardware platform...

00:05.329 --> 00:07.469
...in which developers, makers and designers...

00:07.838 --> 00:10.446
...can create hands-on programming experiences for kids.

00:11.540 --> 00:14.817
As a first step, we've created a system for tangible programming...

00:15.770 --> 00:18.315
...and this system consists of three main components:...

00:18.636 --> 00:21.663
...the brain board, base boards and pucks.

00:22.839 --> 00:25.067
The base board works by placing a puck onto it,...

00:25.830 --> 00:28.215
...and pucks can be programmed with different instructions...

00:28.311 --> 00:32.887
...like turn on or off, move in a direction or increase amount.

00:33.895 --> 00:36.395
The board then simply reads that puck's instruction.

00:37.361 --> 00:40.057
The brain board provides power and connectivity,...

00:40.609 --> 00:43.909
...and when you connect base boards to it, it can read their instructions...

00:44.041 --> 00:47.372
...and send them to connected objects like a toy or a tablet.

00:48.157 --> 00:50.427
The boards can be rearranged in different ways...

00:51.011 --> 00:52.955
...and wrapped in different forms and materials...

00:53.491 --> 00:55.841
...to create all sorts of physical coding experiences.

00:56.615 --> 01:00.603
Like a music maker, where you use physical code to compose music...

01:01.143 --> 01:02.677
...and send it to a wireless speaker.

01:03.483 --> 01:06.759
The ultimate aim of Project Bloks is to give all the work we've done...

01:06.868 --> 01:10.573
...back to the education research and development community for free...

01:10.929 --> 01:13.132
...to accelerate the field of physical programming for kids.
