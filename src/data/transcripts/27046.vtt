00:01.193 --> 00:03.417
First, look for someone approachable.

00:03.629 --> 00:07.419
Start with a smile and introduction. This puts everyone at ease.

00:07.937 --> 00:12.185
Communications expert Carol Fleming says to remember the acronym "ARE."

00:12.820 --> 00:13.267
Anchor.

00:13.639 --> 00:17.259
Find something you have in common. This can be something you've experienced...

00:17.341 --> 00:20.163
...or something you're both experiencing in that moment.

00:20.588 --> 00:21.163
Reveal.

00:21.747 --> 00:24.735
Say something about yourself that relates to your anchor topic,...

00:24.995 --> 00:27.915
...creating trust and providing something for them to respond to.

00:28.754 --> 00:29.591
Encourage.

00:30.188 --> 00:33.761
This is your time to ask a question, prompting them to respond.

00:34.399 --> 00:38.417
Keep your questions open-ended. This allows for a more in-depth conversation.

00:38.880 --> 00:43.483
If you're stumped for a topic, stick to easy ones like their job, hobbies and family...

00:44.015 --> 00:48.977
...but always remember, stay away from controversial topics like politics.

00:49.414 --> 00:50.829
A compliment works well too,...

00:50.885 --> 00:53.551
...just be sure to transition the conversation afterward.

00:54.032 --> 00:55.725
Some people don't know how to handle them.

00:56.340 --> 00:59.729
Using the person's name in conversation will also yield good results.

00:59.932 --> 01:01.898
People appreciate the special attention...

01:02.356 --> 01:05.819
...and remember to listen. People love to talk about themselves.

01:06.156 --> 01:08.925
Restate what you hear to show you are listening.
