00:00.520 --> 00:01.777
All right everyone, listen up.

00:01.949 --> 00:04.943
We need to have a little refresher on our grammar here at the office.

00:05.374 --> 00:07.521
Let's start with the words "your" and "you're."

00:08.533 --> 00:09.671
"Your" is possessive.

00:10.038 --> 00:12.059
It refers to something that belongs to you.

00:12.932 --> 00:13.397
Larry?

00:13.537 --> 00:14.565
Uh, yeah, boss?

00:15.160 --> 00:17.166
That's not how you use your keyboard.

00:19.859 --> 00:24.305
"You're," with an apostrophe, is a contraction of the words "you are."

00:25.992 --> 00:26.533
Sam?

00:27.018 --> 00:28.113
Uh, yeah, boss?

00:28.341 --> 00:30.858
You're playing online poker instead of working.

00:33.922 --> 00:37.330
If you mix up the words "your" and "you're," it can be really confusing.

00:37.946 --> 00:40.426
For instance, there's a big difference between...

00:41.509 --> 00:43.570
Hey, don't forget your bananas.

00:44.193 --> 00:44.604
Thanks!

00:44.803 --> 00:45.582
That's my lunch!

00:46.309 --> 00:46.963
And...

00:48.798 --> 00:50.893
Hey, don't forget you're bananas.

00:52.551 --> 00:53.331
Oh, yeah.

00:53.713 --> 00:55.000
I am bananas.
