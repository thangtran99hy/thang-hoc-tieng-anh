ï»¿ï»¿It's okay if you're nervous.

00:04.117 --> 00:06.000
You're always gonna fall sometimes.

00:06.089 --> 00:07.607
You just have to keep trying.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.576
First time I tried out for swim team,...

00:09.669 --> 00:12.819
...I didn't make it, and I had to try really hard.

00:12.983 --> 00:14.129
I was determined.

00:14.477 --> 00:17.758
When I was in first grade, we had this poster that we had to fill out...

00:17.828 --> 00:19.881
...and I wrote that I wanted to be an Olympian.

00:20.271 --> 00:21.609
And that's how greatness is born.

00:21.874 --> 00:23.007
It's an idea. It's hope.

00:23.333 --> 00:24.955
It's years and years of dedication.

00:25.221 --> 00:26.833
Doing your best at something you love.

00:27.136 --> 00:28.432
I wanna be an Olympic medalist.

00:28.483 --> 00:29.735
I wanna be an Olympic champion.

00:29.940 --> 00:30.460
We all do.

00:30.723 --> 00:33.399
That's the reason we run, is we wanna represent our country.

00:33.458 --> 00:34.172
We wanna get a medal.

00:34.481 --> 00:35.762
Nothing in life is handed to you.

00:36.006 --> 00:37.668
You have to go out there and you have to fight and you have to work.

00:37.975 --> 00:39.571
It doesn't matter if no one else believes in you.

00:39.732 --> 00:40.457
Believe in yourself.

00:40.727 --> 00:43.131
And that's true 'cause i know that anything is possible.

00:43.700 --> 00:47.094
And even if it means that you will never go to the Olympics or you won't win,...

00:47.350 --> 00:50.470
...everything that you've done on to that moment has made you who you are...

00:51.379 --> 00:52.097
...and made you great.
