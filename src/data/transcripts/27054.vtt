We're here to teach you about the power of waking up to eggs.

00:46.225 --> 00:46.489
Yeah?

00:49.461 --> 00:53.409
'Cause we've been in here, watching you sleeping all night long.

00:53.888 --> 00:57.450
Just to wake you up to eggs and sing you this song.

00:58.207 --> 01:01.837
E G G S, E G G S, E G G S, eggs.

01:02.374 --> 01:06.245
E G G S, E G G S, E G G S, eggs.

01:08.586 --> 01:09.408
Your wife is beautiful.

01:12.105 --> 01:12.458
You ready, Mike?

01:12.621 --> 01:12.923
Sure.

01:13.114 --> 01:13.491
We're outta here.
