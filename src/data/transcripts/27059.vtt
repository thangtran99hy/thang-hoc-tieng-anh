The Barter System.

00:02.724 --> 00:05.241
Billy is a lumberjack and Mary is an egg farmer.

00:05.709 --> 00:09.809
After chopping down many trees, Billy soon has more wood than he needs.

00:10.227 --> 00:13.801
Similarly, Mary soon has more chickens and more eggs than she can eat.

00:14.405 --> 00:16.205
That means they have a surplus.

00:17.249 --> 00:21.200
Billy, after chopping down all of the trees, is now very hungry...

00:21.313 --> 00:22.947
...and would very much like some food.

00:23.275 --> 00:26.445
And Mary would like some firewood so she can cook her food.

00:26.944 --> 00:29.911
And thus, a trade will develop between Billy and Mary.

00:30.627 --> 00:33.751
Given enough time, an exchange rate will also develop:...

00:34.202 --> 00:36.867
...say, one egg for one medium-sized log.

00:37.636 --> 00:39.111
But these rates could change.

00:39.637 --> 00:43.338
If some of the chickens died, Mary might demand more logs per egg....

00:43.468 --> 00:45.741
...since she will have less eggs now to trade.

00:46.310 --> 00:49.669
If there were a forest fire, the lumberjack might want more eggs...

00:49.761 --> 00:51.282
...in exchange for his wood.
