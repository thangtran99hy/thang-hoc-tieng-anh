00:01.526 --> 00:06.184
Great moments are born with great opportunity...

00:08.093 --> 00:09.928
...and that's what you have here tonight.

00:11.540 --> 00:13.529
That's what you've earned here tonight.

00:15.941 --> 00:19.013
We maybe behind on the scoreboard at the end of the game,...

00:19.087 --> 00:23.926
...but if you play like that, we cannot be defeated.

00:27.243 --> 00:30.031
Being perfect is not about that scoreboard out there.

00:31.389 --> 00:32.175
It's not about winning.

00:34.207 --> 00:38.705
Being perfect is about being able to look your friends in the eye...

00:39.903 --> 00:43.453
...and know that you didn't let them down.
