ï»¿Okay ladies, here's the first question.

00:04.086 --> 00:07.962
I'm gonna go on a big trip next week and I just wanna know from you...

00:08.055 --> 00:11.658
...what are the three most important things you think I should pack?

00:12.209 --> 00:13.788
Clothes, pack some clothes, okay.

00:13.921 --> 00:14.978
And a toothbrush.

00:15.055 --> 00:16.247
You can have a hat.

00:16.435 --> 00:17.687
Do you think? What kind of hat?

00:17.894 --> 00:18.856
A fancy hat.

00:19.021 --> 00:19.899
I'll get that on my list.

00:19.998 --> 00:24.386
What's the best way to greet someone if you don't speak the same language?

00:24.495 --> 00:25.292
Shake hands.

00:25.373 --> 00:26.157
Blink or...

00:26.285 --> 00:26.612
Smile!

00:27.393 --> 00:27.984
Smile!

00:28.073 --> 00:29.442
What do you think a smile does?

00:29.675 --> 00:31.371
You can give hope to them.

00:31.508 --> 00:32.620
You give them hope?

00:32.828 --> 00:34.246
Aw, that's so sweet.

00:34.336 --> 00:39.457
What would you say to someone who says girls aren't allowed to go to school?

00:40.093 --> 00:42.185
Boys and girls need to be treated equally.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.967
Yeah, they need to be treated equally.

00:44.086 --> 00:46.995
How would you feel if someone told you you couldn't go to school?

00:48.835 --> 00:50.627
Why do you think they need to go to school?

00:51.005 --> 00:51.931
To learn.

00:52.079 --> 00:53.221
To get educated.

00:53.492 --> 00:54.498
And do math.

00:54.598 --> 00:55.846
And do some math.

00:55.955 --> 00:57.044
I think we've covered it.

00:57.297 --> 00:58.233
We got them all.

00:58.366 --> 01:00.259
How would you sum up your experience today?
