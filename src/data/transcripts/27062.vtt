00:00.065 --> 00:02.213
ï»¿This would be the proper forehand grip.

00:02.411 --> 00:07.096
As you can see, the racket is pointing downwards rather than flat.

00:07.911 --> 00:15.084
And this would be the proper backhand grip, with my thumb on the flat end of the racket.

00:15.415 --> 00:19.513
To start, if you're right-handed, put your right hand on the racket face...

00:20.344 --> 00:25.186
...and from there, slide the racket down until you hit the grip.

00:25.625 --> 00:27.495
Close it with the first three fingers.

00:29.396 --> 00:32.380
Put your thumb above the middle finger...

00:32.619 --> 00:37.275
...and your hand should now form a "V" with the racket grip.

00:37.707 --> 00:42.920
It's very similar to shaking somebody's hand as you're holding this racket right now.

00:44.023 --> 00:45.394
With the forehand grip,...

00:46.364 --> 00:50.153
...it allows you to get into proper position as you turn out the racket...

00:50.497 --> 00:52.335
...and swing with your wrist,...

00:53.451 --> 00:57.177
...without anything blocking or hurting your wrist.
