Hi, my name is Nghia Tran...

00:05.156 --> 00:07.961
...and I'm a coach here at Eastbay Badminton Association.

00:08.431 --> 00:12.035
Today, we're gonna talk about proper footwork for beginners.

00:12.165 --> 00:16.511
The equipment that you'll need to do footwork would be proper shoes,...

00:17.111 --> 00:20.359
...a racket to play the sport and of course, a proper court as well.

00:20.805 --> 00:25.708
Make sure the foot is turned towards the direction in which you're going towards...

00:25.967 --> 00:28.442
...and not straight,...

00:28.576 --> 00:32.427
...because you could potentially injure yourself and twist your ankle like that.

00:32.942 --> 00:36.115
Make sure the foot is pointing in the proper direction...

00:36.515 --> 00:38.539
...to balance your body in a proper lunge...

00:38.840 --> 00:40.841
...rather than any other direction,...

00:40.949 --> 00:44.428
...which potentially could help you cause your, twist your ankle.

00:46.134 --> 00:50.109
This is how you do the footwork for the front step backhand.
