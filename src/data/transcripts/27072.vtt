I'm Billy Mitchell, Video Game Player of the Century.

00:11.674 --> 00:13.914
I did the world's first perfect score on Pac-Man.

00:14.170 --> 00:16.943
3,333,360.

00:17.755 --> 00:18.946
It's exhausting to just say it.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.571
You play 255 boards.

00:23.745 --> 00:27.255
On 256, there's enough memory left in the game for the left half of the board,...

00:27.462 --> 00:28.179
...and not the right half.

00:29.813 --> 00:31.696
The right half is filled with computer garble,...

00:32.027 --> 00:33.733
...anything and everything that is not Pac-Man,...

00:34.245 --> 00:35.692
...different walls, different dots.

00:36.318 --> 00:37.397
That's what a perfect score is.

00:38.713 --> 00:44.073
The moment that score went up there, I thought, "Wow, I achieved perfection."

00:44.833 --> 00:46.483
You get to the end, there's nothing to do but die.

00:46.769 --> 00:48.436
There was nothing saying, "Congratulations."

00:48.560 --> 00:50.699
There was nothing saying, "The end, game over."

00:51.127 --> 00:51.481
Nothing.

00:51.871 --> 00:56.321
The designer of Pac-Man, not only did he never think anyone would get to the end,...

00:56.797 --> 00:57.849
...he didn't know where the end was.

00:58.741 --> 01:00.384
He didn't know what point the game would run out of memory.

01:00.996 --> 01:02.828
Everything to him is completely baffling.

01:03.281 --> 01:06.579
They never saw the split screen until I sent it to them.

01:07.361 --> 01:10.289
Masaya Nakamura who's the Godfather of Video Games,...

01:11.092 --> 01:13.386
...he crowned me "Video Game Player of the Century" for that...

01:13.518 --> 01:14.823
...and all the previous achievements.

01:16.915 --> 01:17.971
It doesn't get any higher than that.
