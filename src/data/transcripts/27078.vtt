00:00.033 --> 00:01.415
Jack Reacher, for Major Turner.

00:01.502 --> 00:02.495
Major Turner has been arrested.

00:02.816 --> 00:03.553
On what charge?

00:03.669 --> 00:04.139
Espionage.

00:04.878 --> 00:05.502
She's been set up.

00:07.959 --> 00:09.100
How much does Reacher know?

00:09.969 --> 00:10.526
How's it going?

00:12.091 --> 00:12.983
I don't like being followed.

00:14.342 --> 00:15.529
You think you're invulnerable.

00:15.588 --> 00:15.963
That's right.

00:16.739 --> 00:18.820
Maybe I'll rip your arm off and beat you to death with it.

00:20.214 --> 00:21.189
I'm sorry about this.

00:24.613 --> 00:24.975
Reacher?

00:25.599 --> 00:26.337
They're here to kill you.

00:28.978 --> 00:30.463
My men were shot by one of our own.

00:31.788 --> 00:32.982
This is bigger than I imagined.

00:33.839 --> 00:35.305
You ever lose anyone on your watch, Reacher?

00:41.314 --> 00:42.014
You're a dead man.

00:43.807 --> 00:45.152
You think you're above the law,...

00:47.340 --> 00:48.221
...but I'm not the law.

00:48.767 --> 00:51.129
So, you should start running 'cause I'm gonna start hunting...

00:51.537 --> 00:52.487
...and when I find you,...

00:53.541 --> 00:54.565
...I'm gonna kill you all.
