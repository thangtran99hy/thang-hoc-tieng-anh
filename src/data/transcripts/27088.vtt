Apple not sharing its data I don't think necessarily hurts Apple...

00:04.093 --> 00:07.201
...because that's the secret sauce they want to keep at the end of the day.

00:07.295 --> 00:09.104
You don't see Google sharing its data either.

00:11.281 --> 00:13.937
I think everybody in the room needs to remember, as an individual or a company,...

00:14.274 --> 00:15.347
...there's nothing for free.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.977
So, if you're getting a free service for sharing your data,...

00:18.183 --> 00:20.854
...that's because the data is more valuable than what you pay for it.

00:21.343 --> 00:24.069
The value of data goes up every day that AI advances.

00:24.144 --> 00:25.932
At some point, there will be a market for it.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.857
I think Apple does the right thing to keep a bunch of it private.

00:29.159 --> 00:32.943
Data's gonna have more value in the future and we're gonna build economies on our data.

00:33.029 --> 00:34.049
Data will become a currency.

00:34.254 --> 00:35.303
Data's the new oil.
