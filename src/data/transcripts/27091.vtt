00:03.963 --> 00:06.884
I've tried playing it cool...

00:07.700 --> 00:10.729
...but when I'm looking at you,...

00:11.499 --> 00:14.433
...I can never be brave...

00:14.762 --> 00:18.584
...'cause you make my heart race.

00:18.811 --> 00:22.005
Shot me out of the sky,...

00:22.651 --> 00:25.752
...you're my kryptonite.

00:26.453 --> 00:29.593
You keep making me weak...

00:29.768 --> 00:33.443
...yeah, frozen and can't breathe.

00:33.704 --> 00:36.269
Something's gotta give now...

00:37.060 --> 00:40.038
...'cause I'm dying just to make you see...

00:40.794 --> 00:43.761
...that I need you here with me now...

00:44.807 --> 00:48.193
...'cause you've got that one thing.

00:48.330 --> 00:52.008
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else.

00:52.105 --> 00:55.619
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed.

00:55.799 --> 00:59.415
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell.

00:59.556 --> 01:01.718
You don't know, oh oh,...

01:02.100 --> 01:05.501
...you don't know you're beautiful, oh oh.

01:05.827 --> 01:08.393
That's what makes you beautiful.
