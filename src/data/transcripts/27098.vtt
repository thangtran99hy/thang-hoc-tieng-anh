ï»¿Time is the most valuable thing there is.

00:03.696 --> 00:06.564
Since the beginning of time, there never seemed to be enough of it.

00:07.073 --> 00:10.949
People try to beat time but time always wins.

00:11.107 --> 00:14.299
Sometimes when you run out of time, you wind up doing time.

00:15.682 --> 00:18.201
And even if you're rich, you can't buy more time,...

00:19.201 --> 00:20.389
...although some people will try.

00:21.421 --> 00:24.127
Not having enough time is the basic plot of most action movies.

00:24.267 --> 00:25.409
There's not enough time!

00:25.500 --> 00:26.875
Do your job, Ramirez.

00:27.163 --> 00:29.240
Our greatest fear is running out of time.

00:32.223 --> 00:35.049
And you just spent 34 seconds of it watching this commercial.

00:35.179 --> 00:36.341
Wait, what?

00:36.403 --> 00:37.216
So sorry about that.

00:37.445 --> 00:39.951
There's a bomb in the salsa can, we gotta get out of here.

00:40.019 --> 00:41.357
My phone's still charging!

00:41.541 --> 00:41.804
What?

00:41.986 --> 00:44.189
So, if time is the most valuable thing there is,...

00:44.297 --> 00:46.848
...why would you waste more than you have to charging your phone?

00:53.637 --> 00:54.723
It's not my best work.

00:54.861 --> 00:58.636
