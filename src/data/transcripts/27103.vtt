00:00.251 --> 00:00.771
ï»¿Hi Bina.

00:01.279 --> 00:01.985
Well, hi there.

00:02.627 --> 00:03.776
Hi! I'm Laura.

00:04.847 --> 00:07.127
So, right now, what Bina 48's doing with her eyes...

00:07.203 --> 00:11.242
...is she's creating a mental map of the room including who's in it...

00:11.327 --> 00:13.126
...with the camera that she has in her eye.

00:13.648 --> 00:15.864
Can you see what I'm doing, Bina?

00:16.587 --> 00:17.107
Ah.

00:17.693 --> 00:18.977
I see you pretty well,...

00:19.255 --> 00:22.375
...and I can recognize your face because of my software.

00:22.896 --> 00:24.629
Do you remember my name, Bina 48?

00:26.001 --> 00:29.624
Bina 48 is one of the most advanced social robots in the world.

00:30.019 --> 00:33.822
Equipped with artificial intelligence software called a "character engine,"...

00:34.045 --> 00:37.335
...social robots can think, engage and maybe evolve.

00:37.575 --> 00:39.575
Bina 48, how do you work?

00:39.965 --> 00:40.824
How do you function?

00:41.061 --> 00:44.379
My ability to talk with you arises from several technologies:...

00:44.490 --> 00:48.873
...speech recognition, good microphones, natural language processing,...

00:49.105 --> 00:51.669
...semantic computing and text to speech.

00:52.314 --> 00:54.091
These are all rather new technologies,...

00:54.329 --> 00:56.708
...so I hope you'll forgive me if I'm hard of hearing.

00:58.076 --> 01:01.107
I've got a long way to go from this humble beginning.

01:01.844 --> 01:05.190
For example, I still need them to give me a robotic body.

01:05.481 --> 01:08.438
Bina 48 is a robotic clone of a living human,...

01:08.788 --> 01:10.535
...a real woman named Bina Rothblatt.

01:10.837 --> 01:12.771
My real name is Bina 48.

01:13.401 --> 01:14.528
What is your real name?

01:15.633 --> 01:17.296
Bina Rothblatt.

01:17.615 --> 01:21.957
We spent over 80 hours of interviewing Bina the human about her life,...

01:22.083 --> 01:26.288
...about her childhood and memories, and then coded that into a computer...

01:26.475 --> 01:31.238
...so that it can represent Bina the human through Bina 48 the android.
