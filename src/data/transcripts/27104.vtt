ï»¿In the middle of the ocean, there lies an island where animals rule.

00:07.627 --> 00:09.148
Is there anything you wouldn't eat?

00:09.697 --> 00:10.991
Until the day...

00:12.447 --> 00:13.567
What's out there, Mak?

00:13.796 --> 00:16.347
I'm not sure what it is.

00:16.533 --> 00:18.534
...they got an unexpected visitor.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.068
Oh land, sweet land!

00:24.188 --> 00:26.787
We need to find out what these newcomers' intentions are.

00:26.866 --> 00:28.844
Look, he stripped off his skin.

00:28.951 --> 00:30.371
It's hideous!

00:31.232 --> 00:32.545
I'm going to be sick.

00:32.633 --> 00:33.880
This is not good, Mike.

00:34.003 --> 00:35.264
To save their island,...

00:35.377 --> 00:35.878
Get him!

00:36.270 --> 00:37.933
...they'll have to work together.

00:42.087 --> 00:43.689
Many thanks, Scrubs.

00:46.737 --> 00:47.760
The Wild Life.

00:55.097 --> 00:56.843
Just another day in paradise.
