00:00.231 --> 00:02.777
ï»¿Isaac Newton laid the foundations of modern science.

00:03.148 --> 00:04.135
He discovered gravity...

00:04.221 --> 00:06.713
...and the principles governing motion, light and cooling.

00:07.076 --> 00:08.343
He invented calculus.

00:08.839 --> 00:11.305
Most of his work made a huge and lasting contribution...

00:11.424 --> 00:12.683
...to the state of human knowledge,...

00:13.057 --> 00:15.431
...but a few of his projects never made it any further...

00:15.566 --> 00:17.071
...than the paper they were outlined on.

00:17.828 --> 00:21.183
All generations that came after him would benefit from his innovations,...

00:21.581 --> 00:25.370
...but none of them would ever use one that he outlined in his student notebooks:...

00:25.747 --> 00:27.606
...his universal language.

00:28.953 --> 00:30.761
When Newton was just beginning college,...

00:30.931 --> 00:33.897
...he drew up plans for a language based on the nature of things,...

00:34.193 --> 00:35.814
...rather than on mere convention.

00:36.407 --> 00:39.205
We call an apple "apple" just out of habit.

00:39.753 --> 00:41.615
The form of the word, the sounds in it,...

00:41.729 --> 00:43.581
...don't tell you anything about what it means.

00:44.283 --> 00:48.134
Newton's idea was to let the names of the same sort of things...

00:48.232 --> 00:49.575
...begin with the same letter.

00:50.219 --> 00:52.955
If, say, all fruits started with "a,"...

00:53.410 --> 00:56.580
...words wouldn't just be arbitrary labels, haphazardly assigned.

00:57.041 --> 01:00.644
You could know just from hearing a word what category of thing it belonged to.

01:01.255 --> 01:01.873
Agnar?

01:02.513 --> 01:03.887
Don't know exactly what it is,...

01:04.229 --> 01:06.779
...but it starts with "a," so I know it's a fruit.
