00:04.729 --> 00:07.006
Okay, can I just say something crazy?

00:07.227 --> 00:08.353
I love crazy!

00:08.891 --> 00:13.087
All my life has been a series of doors in my face...

00:13.639 --> 00:16.333
...and then suddenly, I bump into you.

00:16.437 --> 00:17.649
I've been thinking the same thing...

00:18.025 --> 00:22.739
...'cause like, I've been searching my whole life to find my own place...

00:23.165 --> 00:27.355
...and maybe it's the party talking or the chocolate fondue.

00:27.476 --> 00:28.721
But with you,...

00:28.824 --> 00:31.149
...but with you, I found my place,...

00:31.232 --> 00:32.581
...I see your face...

00:32.791 --> 00:36.384
...and it's nothing like I've ever known before.

00:36.848 --> 00:41.260
Love is an open door.

00:41.572 --> 00:46.166
Love is an open door.

00:46.396 --> 00:48.103
Love is an open door.

00:48.179 --> 00:51.121
With you, with you, with you, with you,...

00:51.287 --> 00:53.597
...love is an open door.
