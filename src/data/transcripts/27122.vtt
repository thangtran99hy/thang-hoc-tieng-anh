Every year of every day, thousands of people fall victim to FWP...

00:05.051 --> 00:07.267
...also known as First World Problems.

00:07.394 --> 00:12.954
I'm so cold, somebody set the AC to 72; I need it at 73.

00:13.088 --> 00:16.890
Starving, all we have is leftovers.

00:16.991 --> 00:18.091
Nobody cares about me.

00:18.754 --> 00:20.965
Nobody commented or liked my status.

00:21.283 --> 00:24.564
Hi, I'm Ryan Higa, and for just five hours of attention a day,...

00:24.903 --> 00:26.419
...you could help somebody with FWP.

00:26.701 --> 00:28.949
Everyone keeps putting so much pressure on me.

00:29.617 --> 00:31.299
I don't know what I want for my birthday.

00:31.806 --> 00:33.259
I have too much chips for my dip,...

00:34.269 --> 00:37.280
...but if I open a new dip, I'll have too much dip for my chips.

00:37.914 --> 00:40.295
Why does Apple keep making new iPhones?

00:40.829 --> 00:42.300
Now I have to get another one.

00:42.652 --> 00:44.088
They've been through so much struggle,...

00:44.361 --> 00:45.457
...so much hardship,...

00:45.666 --> 00:47.831
...so much attention.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.506
Show your support and send them this video...

00:51.649 --> 00:54.226
...and show them how much we care about their FWPs.
