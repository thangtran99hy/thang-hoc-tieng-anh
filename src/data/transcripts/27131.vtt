00:00.791 --> 00:02.802
Like a city from a children's storybook,....

00:03.311 --> 00:06.314
...Prague conjures up images of romantic fairy tales,...

00:07.117 --> 00:10.903
and when the clouds roll in, dark gothic folk stories.

00:11.607 --> 00:13.634
Yet, it can be refreshingly modern too.

00:15.861 --> 00:19.076
Prague's cobblestone streets rarely follow a straight line.

00:19.853 --> 00:23.813
The city is a labyrinth where even locals get happily lost.

00:24.775 --> 00:28.041
This was a place designed for horse and cart and walking,...

00:28.421 --> 00:30.199
...so pack some comfortable shoes.

00:31.641 --> 00:34.958
An easy way to discover Prague is to follow the Royal Route.

00:36.035 --> 00:39.245
This historic coronation path begins at the Powder Tower,...

00:39.975 --> 00:42.928
...one of the original gateways to Prague's Old Town.

00:47.155 --> 00:49.497
A few blocks away is Old Town Square,...

00:49.868 --> 00:52.229
...a plaza surrounded by former palaces.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.480
Enjoy some traditional street food like trdelnik,...

00:56.763 --> 00:59.588
...then gather with travelers from all over the world...

00:59.814 --> 01:01.324
...under the astronomical clock.

01:02.606 --> 01:06.433
Across the Square is Tyn Church, whose turrets and spires...

01:06.706 --> 01:10.645
...are said to be the inspiration for some of Walt Disney's famous castles.
