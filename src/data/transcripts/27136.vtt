00:01.478 --> 00:02.852
ï»¿This coin is called a penny.

00:03.693 --> 00:05.934
A penny is worth only one cent.

00:06.485 --> 00:09.779
The word 'cent' is used when talking about coins.

00:10.502 --> 00:12.369
This is the cent symbol.

00:14.431 --> 00:18.530
Okay, let's use our tens blocks to compare the worth or value of this coin.

00:19.335 --> 00:23.000
The penny is only worth one cent as we see here.

00:24.693 --> 00:26.996
This next coin is called a nickel.

00:27.445 --> 00:29.501
A nickel is worth five cents.

00:31.049 --> 00:34.177
These five ones blocks represent the value of this nickel.

00:35.144 --> 00:39.429
So the penny is worth one cent and the nickel is worth five cents.

00:40.041 --> 00:43.061
Our next coin is smaller than the nickel and the penny.

00:43.529 --> 00:47.813
But just as we learned with the ring and the rock, the size is not important.

00:48.067 --> 00:50.051
This coin is called a dime.

00:50.413 --> 00:52.181
A dime is worth ten cents.

00:52.472 --> 00:54.766
We can see this with one of our tens blocks.

00:56.394 --> 00:58.379
This tens block has ten block in it.

00:58.844 --> 01:00.307
So it represents the dime.

01:01.236 --> 01:03.044
So the penny is worth one cent,...

01:03.378 --> 01:05.071
...the nickel is worth five cents,...

01:05.294 --> 01:07.163
...and the dime is worth ten cents.

01:08.409 --> 01:10.403
Our last coin is called a quarter.

01:10.764 --> 01:12.757
A quarter is worth 25 cents.

01:14.231 --> 01:18.375
To show 25 cents with our blocks, we would need 25 blocks right?

01:19.447 --> 01:25.589
So to get 25 blocks, we need two tens blocks and five ones blocks.
