ï»¿From the moment she's born, a man's daughter is the center of his universe.

00:07.429 --> 00:08.307
You give her love.

00:09.349 --> 00:10.680
You give her encouragement.

00:11.579 --> 00:14.933
You watch her grow into a strong, confident woman.

00:17.384 --> 00:18.573
And then one day,...

00:18.890 --> 00:21.813
...you come face-to-face with the love of her life.

00:21.935 --> 00:23.807
The Flemings are in the house!

00:24.249 --> 00:24.795
Yes!

00:25.026 --> 00:26.203
Oh my God.

00:26.458 --> 00:28.937
Well, looks like he works out quite a bit.

00:29.037 --> 00:30.189
Stephie, get them up here!

00:30.277 --> 00:30.919
Please be please.

00:31.930 --> 00:34.761
Dad, on Christmas day, I'm gonna ask Stephie to marry me...

00:34.835 --> 00:36.363
...and I'd really like your blessing.

00:37.507 --> 00:38.089
Yeah.

00:38.311 --> 00:38.589
No.

00:38.843 --> 00:40.684
Just give me a couple days to win you over.

00:40.802 --> 00:43.159
By Christmas morning, you're gonna be calling me "son",...

00:43.253 --> 00:44.263
...I'm gonna be calling you "dad".

00:44.371 --> 00:45.477
Don't think that's going to happen.

00:45.613 --> 00:46.753
I think it's gonna, Dad.

00:46.861 --> 00:47.441
I know it won't.

00:47.679 --> 00:48.287
Dad, it will.

00:48.391 --> 00:48.712
Stop that.

00:48.802 --> 00:49.306
What, dad?

00:49.473 --> 00:50.729
That, stop that.

00:50.828 --> 00:51.597
Dad, what are you talking about?

00:52.419 --> 00:54.149
Steph, you could be dating anyone.

00:54.261 --> 00:55.108
Why Laird?

00:55.215 --> 00:56.453
He makes me really happy.

00:56.538 --> 00:59.735
He is wrapping his tentacles around every member of this family.

01:02.284 --> 01:04.581
You're not going to say anything to Stephanie about the proposal, right?

01:04.787 --> 01:05.580
Is that a drone?

01:05.735 --> 01:06.881
Laird is spying on us.

01:06.975 --> 01:07.348
What?

01:07.471 --> 01:09.566
Do not mess with me!
