ï»¿You know, some folks might think grammar isn't important in this business,...

00:04.715 --> 00:06.057
...but that just isn't true.

00:06.337 --> 00:08.733
You've gotta know the difference between "whose" and "who's"...

00:08.879 --> 00:10.842
...in order to get to the bottom of a mystery.

00:11.659 --> 00:13.535
"Whose" indicates ownership.

00:13.916 --> 00:16.847
For instance, whose sword is this?

00:17.156 --> 00:22.898
My intuition tells me it must belong to someone whose arms can hold a giant, metal sword.

00:23.063 --> 00:25.577
"Who's" is the contraction of "who is."

00:25.851 --> 00:28.835
For instance, who's responsible for this?

00:30.654 --> 00:32.945
Well, I think we know who's guilty.

00:33.862 --> 00:34.839
Case closed.

00:35.130 --> 00:36.693
Who's the best cop in town?

00:37.935 --> 00:39.743
Are those donuts I smell?

00:40.079 --> 00:41.397
Whose are those?
