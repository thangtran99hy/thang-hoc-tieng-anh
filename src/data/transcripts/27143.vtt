J. K. Rowling has revealed that the new play,...

00:05.665 --> 00:07.294
...Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,...

00:07.374 --> 00:10.297
...will be the final story about the world-famous wizard.

00:11.061 --> 00:13.037
Rowling's comments came at the opening gala...

00:13.157 --> 00:15.693
...for the already hugely popular play in London.

00:16.105 --> 00:20.075
No. No, he goes on a very big journey during these two plays...

00:20.863 --> 00:22.703
...and then I think we are, yeah I think we're done.

00:23.115 --> 00:24.643
This is the next generation, you know.

00:24.715 --> 00:27.705
So, I'm thrilled to see it realized so beautifully...

00:27.834 --> 00:30.273
...but I, you know, Harry is done now.
