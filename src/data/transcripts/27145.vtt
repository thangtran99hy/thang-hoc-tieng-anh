00:01.970 --> 00:04.133
The expression "like talking to a wall"...

00:04.530 --> 00:08.234
...means that the person you're talking to can't or won't listen.

00:08.953 --> 00:12.164
Because walls can't listen. Or can they?

00:13.552 --> 00:17.473
It's exactly this kind of accepted wisdom that we love debunking.

00:18.025 --> 00:22.649
If you have ingenuity and determination, then really, nothing's impossible.

00:23.502 --> 00:26.591
We're going to attach an accelerometer to one side of the wall.

00:27.162 --> 00:29.889
If we're right, it should be sensitive enough to detect...

00:30.011 --> 00:34.042
...the tiny vibrations produced by a person talking on the other side.

00:34.838 --> 00:36.297
We'll be filtering the signal...

00:36.431 --> 00:40.090
...and then playing it through speakers to a group of kids on the far side.

00:45.079 --> 00:49.595
So, in a way, the kids will be listening to what the wall is hearing.

00:51.113 --> 00:53.351
We won't have someone just talking to a wall.

00:53.723 --> 00:56.018
He'll be reading a whole storybook.

00:59.333 --> 01:00.683
Let's see if it works.

01:01.517 --> 01:04.300
There was one difference, although very slight.

01:12.254 --> 01:15.915
...forever in peace just as they ought to.
