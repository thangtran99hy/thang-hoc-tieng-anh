ï»¿Hey there folks!

00:01.565 --> 00:04.737
It's me, the extra crispy Colonel.

00:05.284 --> 00:09.321
Now, I love original recipe but in this sizzling summer heat,...

00:09.427 --> 00:12.952
...I'm feeling a little extra crispy.

00:13.342 --> 00:17.386
My Extra Crispy $20 Fill-Up is freshly double breaded...

00:17.449 --> 00:20.430
...and fried to a luxurious, mouth-watering bronze.

00:20.887 --> 00:24.366
Extra crispy isn't just a product, it's a lifestyle.

00:26.008 --> 00:29.561
KFC: it's extra crispy good.
