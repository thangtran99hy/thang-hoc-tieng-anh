Set on a sprawling 150-acre estate,...

00:03.872 --> 00:05.939
...Giraffe Manor is a free-roaming sanctuary...

00:06.007 --> 00:08.260
...for several endangered Rothschild giraffes.

00:08.944 --> 00:11.975
Giraffe Manor was built in 1932...

00:12.477 --> 00:14.605
...and was modeled on a Scottish hunting lodge.

00:14.757 --> 00:17.021
It wasn't until the 1970s,...

00:17.213 --> 00:20.763
...however, that the manor became involved in giraffe conservation.

00:21.298 --> 00:23.392
Located in the suburbs of Nairobi, Kenya,...

00:23.551 --> 00:25.998
...the sanctuary was established in 1974.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.803
Today, it's still run as a sanctuary with a successful breeding program...

00:29.859 --> 00:31.931
...that supports Rothschild giraffes in the wild.

00:32.059 --> 00:35.063
To help fund the project, the sanctuary owners also run a hotel...

00:35.121 --> 00:37.975
...where guests like Robin can share a one of a kind breakfast...

00:38.035 --> 00:39.369
...with the long-necked creatures.
