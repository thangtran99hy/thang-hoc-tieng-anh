00:00.239 --> 00:03.533
In order to understand Rousseff, we need to start with her predecessor,...

00:03.897 --> 00:07.624
...President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, aka Lula.

00:08.144 --> 00:11.169
A rags-to-riches story, Lula was wildly popular...

00:11.255 --> 00:13.839
...and became a symbol for Brazil's economic ascent...

00:13.951 --> 00:16.465
...as one of the top exporters in the world of commodities...

00:16.561 --> 00:19.792
...such as oil, soybeans, corn and iron ore.

00:20.417 --> 00:22.267
Dilma Rousseff was Lula's protege...

00:22.375 --> 00:26.349
...and became the first woman to be elected president of Brazil in 2010.

00:26.601 --> 00:30.549
During Rousseff's presidency, global prices for raw materials began dropping.

00:30.762 --> 00:33.823
And a corruption scandal paralyzed many infrastructure projects,...

00:34.045 --> 00:36.033
...putting severe strain on Brazil's economy.

00:36.334 --> 00:37.204
How bad did it get?

00:37.581 --> 00:41.215
Brazil's economy shrank 3.8 percent in 2015,...

00:41.545 --> 00:43.172
...the most in a quarter century.

00:43.463 --> 00:45.855
The country's credit rating was downgraded to junk.

00:46.103 --> 00:50.511
And business and consumer confidence levels fell to nearly their lowest on record.
