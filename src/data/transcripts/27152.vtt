00:03.245 --> 00:04.743
ï»¿Hello, hello, Serena.

00:05.190 --> 00:06.498
Hey, I've been waiting on you.

00:06.629 --> 00:07.423
What's going on?

00:07.590 --> 00:08.640
What's going on?

00:08.784 --> 00:12.747
I'm elated to ask you 73 random questions for your September collection debut...

00:12.979 --> 00:14.207
...and congratulations on Wimbledon.

00:14.345 --> 00:14.957
Thank you.

00:15.075 --> 00:16.333
How are you feeling about life right now?

00:16.739 --> 00:18.776
Life is pretty good.

00:18.921 --> 00:21.681
And in life, how many matches do you think you've played?

00:22.339 --> 00:23.037
Gosh, I don't know.

00:23.161 --> 00:25.567
Somewhere, definitely over a thousand, I don't know.

00:25.828 --> 00:28.243
Which of your competitors has helped improve your game the most?

00:28.478 --> 00:29.959
Definitely Venus.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.890
If you can master any other sport, what would it be?

00:32.756 --> 00:33.655
I would do ballet.

00:34.025 --> 00:36.634
Past or present, who would you love to play a match against?

00:37.193 --> 00:38.437
Althea Gibson.

00:38.761 --> 00:41.056
Past or present, who would be your dream doubles partner?

00:41.321 --> 00:43.674
Honestly, I just can't get better than Venus.

00:43.803 --> 00:44.919
Who is your tennis icon?

00:46.591 --> 00:47.527
Monica Seles.

00:47.697 --> 00:49.276
What is your strangest superstition?

00:50.069 --> 00:51.492
I don't have superstitions.

00:51.906 --> 00:54.352
What do you predict would happen if you hit someone with your serve?

00:54.907 --> 00:57.437
Okay, we would have to immediately stop everything,...

00:57.529 --> 01:00.421
...call 911 and rush them to the hospital.

01:00.543 --> 01:01.730
That does not sound pleasant at all.

01:01.817 --> 01:02.252
It's not.

01:02.363 --> 01:03.108
It's not good.
