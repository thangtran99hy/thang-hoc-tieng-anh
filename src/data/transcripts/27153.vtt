00:07.020 --> 00:10.791
ï»¿For a year of my life, I lived in a cabin in the woods...

00:10.881 --> 00:14.741
...without any running water, plumbing or electricity.

00:15.214 --> 00:16.872
I sang opera for five years.

00:16.959 --> 00:19.231
I can sing in Italian, German and French.

00:22.093 --> 00:23.092
I have six tattoos.

00:23.173 --> 00:24.113
They all have meaning to me...

00:24.205 --> 00:26.691
...and they remind me every day of what matters most in life.

00:28.849 --> 00:33.841
I once swallowed my tongue piercing and I owned a 9mm gun.

00:33.969 --> 00:36.047
When I was a kid, I was a competitive arm wrestler...

00:36.166 --> 00:38.809
...and spent my Sundays dirt biking through the woods.

00:41.631 --> 00:43.289
I have around 15 tattoos.

00:43.357 --> 00:44.596
I've kinda stopped counting...

00:45.125 --> 00:46.925
...but I really enjoy it because it's a cool way...

00:47.031 --> 00:50.603
...to commemorate certain parts of my life permanently on my body.
