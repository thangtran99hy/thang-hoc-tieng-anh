ï»¿Disinfectant wipes are great for quick cleanups...

00:02.307 --> 00:03.667
...and keeping your surfaces sterile.

00:03.874 --> 00:05.453
The only problem is that they're overpriced.

00:05.615 --> 00:07.931
So, why not make your own with some household materials?

00:08.075 --> 00:10.195
Grab a roll of paper towels and cut it to fit...

00:10.292 --> 00:13.144
...inside of a small Tupperware container with a serrated knife.

00:13.383 --> 00:14.910
Though it might look a bit ugly at the bottom,...

00:15.023 --> 00:17.037
...but we're more concerned with functionality here.

00:17.181 --> 00:19.738
Pop out the center tube and pull out a bit of the paper towel...

00:19.821 --> 00:21.265
...to serve as a dispensing point.

00:21.479 --> 00:23.339
Make a mixture of half a cup of water...

00:23.563 --> 00:25.017
...and half a cup of rubbing alcohol.

00:25.173 --> 00:27.988
Now, this is enough to party, but if you want it to smell good too,...

00:28.103 --> 00:31.131
...add some drops of essential oil, place the roll into the Tupperware...

00:31.193 --> 00:33.725
...and slowly pour the mixture over it until it's saturated.

00:34.026 --> 00:37.323
Cut a small "x" into the lid and feed the towels through the hole.

00:37.470 --> 00:38.800
Snap it shut and you're all set.

00:39.001 --> 00:40.990
Just keep it nearby to clean up any surfaces...

00:41.071 --> 00:42.390
...that need some quick sanitation.
