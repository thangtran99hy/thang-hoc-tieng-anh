00:00.234 --> 00:01.127
You've got mail.

00:01.333 --> 00:01.614
Goodbye.

00:01.691 --> 00:04.506
To all of you who thought AOL was voiced by a computer,...

00:04.905 --> 00:06.719
...now let's set the record straight.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.503
I recorded those phrases.

00:08.847 --> 00:09.441
Welcome!

00:09.963 --> 00:10.825
You've got mail!

00:11.472 --> 00:12.181
File's done.

00:12.722 --> 00:13.246
Goodbye.

00:13.829 --> 00:17.691
My name is Elwood Edwards and I'm the voice of "You've got mail."

00:18.542 --> 00:24.367
In 1989, my wife was a customer service rep...

00:24.639 --> 00:27.829
...for the company that was about to become America Online.

00:28.543 --> 00:31.067
She heard Steve Case talking to some of the programmers...

00:31.140 --> 00:34.597
...about how fun it would be to add a voice to the software.

00:35.376 --> 00:38.481
I've been an announcer throughout my entire broadcasting career,...

00:39.143 --> 00:41.049
...and she volunteered me.

00:42.383 --> 00:44.569
I scribbled those phrases on a piece of paper...

00:44.894 --> 00:47.090
...and like I say on the cassette deck, I recorded...

00:47.345 --> 00:50.458
...the "Welcome, you've got mail, file's done, goodbye."

00:51.434 --> 00:54.758
It started off as a test just to see if it would catch on,...

00:55.267 --> 00:59.193
...and lo and behold, in the mid-90s, it had really caught on.

00:59.583 --> 01:05.860
And at one point, they said my voice was heard more than 35 million times a day.
