I note the obvious differences in the human family.

00:05.951 --> 00:07.157
Some of us are serious.

00:08.199 --> 00:09.845
Some thrive on comedy.

00:10.877 --> 00:14.698
I've sailed upon the seven seas and stopped in every land.

00:15.401 --> 00:17.117
I've seen the wonders of the world,...

00:17.978 --> 00:19.910
...not yet one common man.

00:21.016 --> 00:25.249
I know 10,000 women called Jane and Mary Jane.

00:26.361 --> 00:29.754
I've not seen any two who really were the same.

00:30.423 --> 00:34.831

00:35.276 --> 00:40.085
...and lovers think quite different thoughts while lying side by side.

00:40.949 --> 00:45.666
I note the obvious differences between each sort and type,...

00:46.315 --> 00:50.213
...but we are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike.

00:50.712 --> 00:55.472
We are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike.
