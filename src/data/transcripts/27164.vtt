ï»¿You're gonna say one simple sentence to him...

00:01.587 --> 00:02.638
...and he's gonna give you the package.

00:02.783 --> 00:04.295
You're gonna say, "Elephants can swim."

00:04.479 --> 00:05.284
Can you swim?

00:05.394 --> 00:06.337
No. Are you listening?

00:06.406 --> 00:07.249
Yeah, I'm listening.

00:07.421 --> 00:08.682
Elephants can swim.

00:09.059 --> 00:10.183
What?

00:10.311 --> 00:11.004
Oh my God.

00:11.580 --> 00:13.139
Do you see the hot dog stand behind you?

00:13.265 --> 00:14.657
I need you to go buy a hot dog.

00:15.331 --> 00:17.262
Those hot dogs are like, $14, man.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.043
I see the man on the bridge.

00:20.255 --> 00:22.543
Walk up towards him and say, "You have something for me".

00:23.723 --> 00:24.492
Are you serious?

00:27.014 --> 00:27.971
Yeah, I don't know man, some...

00:28.023 --> 00:29.390
Believe me, it's not about the hot dog.

00:29.467 --> 00:31.949
You're not gonna eat the hot dog and the hot dog isn't even real.

00:32.013 --> 00:33.005
It's what's in the hot dog.

00:33.095 --> 00:35.011
I promise, you will thank me at the end of this.

00:35.849 --> 00:37.411
Yeah, 'cause I don't usually eat pork.

00:39.563 --> 00:43.621
You're gonna walk up to that man and just say, "Great day for a hot dog".

00:44.049 --> 00:45.789
But do not give him the hot dog.

00:46.376 --> 00:47.253
Great day for a...

00:51.725 --> 00:53.255
It's a great day for a hot dog, huh?

00:57.119 --> 00:58.637
That's excellent work Adam, let him clear.

00:58.697 --> 00:59.249
Let him clear.

00:59.307 --> 01:00.701
If something happens, it's gonna happen now...

01:00.767 --> 01:01.540
...and it's gonna happen to him.

01:01.601 --> 01:02.563
He didn't take the hot dog.

01:02.623 --> 01:03.385
I've still got the hot dog.

01:03.501 --> 01:05.294
No, I told you not to give him the hot dog.

01:06.544 --> 01:07.161
Now, walk away.

01:07.311 --> 01:07.512
Walk away.

01:07.574 --> 01:08.046
What is this?

01:08.225 --> 01:10.786
That manila envelope is the hottest potato you've ever held in your hand.
