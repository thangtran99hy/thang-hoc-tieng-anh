00:01.134 --> 00:03.671
For many Japanese, these will be some of the strongest memories...

00:03.742 --> 00:06.151
...of an emperor now preparing to end his reign.

00:06.563 --> 00:10.343
In 2011, Akihito and Empress Michiko were in the forefront...

00:10.561 --> 00:11.868
...as the country struggled to recover...

00:11.935 --> 00:15.165
...from the devastating earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster,...

00:15.556 --> 00:17.973
...appealing to their people's strength and compassion.

00:19.093 --> 00:21.553
As a boy, Akihito lived through the Second World War,...

00:21.817 --> 00:24.385
...being prepared for a role widely seen as divine.

00:25.617 --> 00:28.133
After the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,...

00:28.411 --> 00:32.743
...his father, Emperor Hirohito, persuaded his ministers and generals to surrender...

00:33.156 --> 00:35.172
...and, under a US written constitution,...

00:35.358 --> 00:39.410
...would renounce any claims to imperial divinity and all political power.

00:40.211 --> 00:43.307
As crowned Prince, Akihito dispensed with a thousand-year-old tradition...

00:43.442 --> 00:44.487
...by marrying a commoner.

00:44.973 --> 00:47.167
Succeeding to the throne in 1989,...

00:47.489 --> 00:50.595

00:50.666 --> 00:52.679
...transformed by its economic rise.
