ï»¿Bridget, who do you want to be the father?

00:05.197 --> 00:05.833
I don't know.

00:06.187 --> 00:07.839
It's like the final of The X Factor.

00:08.247 --> 00:12.020
Dial 01 if you want it to be Mark and 02 if you want it to be Jack.

00:15.027 --> 00:15.694
Are you in love with him?

00:16.091 --> 00:18.831
I have been, in the past.

00:19.419 --> 00:19.751
And me?

00:20.687 --> 00:22.921
I could be, one day.

00:23.322 --> 00:25.646
How do you orchestrate such cliffhangers in your life?

00:27.234 --> 00:29.101
This is not how I thought this would be.

00:29.395 --> 00:34.277
But however we choose to do this, the most important thing is the baby.

00:35.087 --> 00:36.829
You're the best thing I've ever seen.

00:40.442 --> 00:42.015
Good God, Bridget, you're immense!

00:42.091 --> 00:42.928
This is a two-man job.

00:44.516 --> 00:45.154
Don't drop her.

00:46.289 --> 00:47.311
Which of you is the father?

00:47.451 --> 00:47.837
I am.

00:48.531 --> 00:48.733
Right.
