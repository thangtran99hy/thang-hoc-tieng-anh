ï»¿Seems like everybody's got a price.

00:05.727 --> 00:08.071
I wonder how they sleep at night...

00:08.405 --> 00:11.273
...when the sale comes first and the truth comes second.

00:11.329 --> 00:14.279
Just stop for a minute and smile.

00:14.549 --> 00:16.949
Why is everybody so serious,...

00:17.320 --> 00:19.584
...acting so dang mysterious?

00:19.859 --> 00:22.711
Got your shades on your eyes and your heels so high,...

00:23.055 --> 00:25.816
...you can't even have a good time.

00:25.901 --> 00:27.689
Everybody look to the left,...

00:28.529 --> 00:30.801
...everybody look to the right.

00:30.958 --> 00:34.683
Can you feel that yeah, we're paying with love tonight.

00:34.955 --> 00:37.486
It's not about the money, money, money.

00:37.833 --> 00:40.199
We don't need your money, money, money.

00:40.612 --> 00:43.027
Just wanna make the world dance,...

00:43.439 --> 00:45.601
...forget about the price tag.

00:46.195 --> 00:48.910
Ain't about the cha-ching, cha-ching,...

00:49.001 --> 00:51.731
...ain't about the, no, bling, bling.

00:51.822 --> 00:54.124
Wanna make the world dance,...

00:54.571 --> 00:56.891
...forget about the price tag.
