It's the biggest timber-frame structure in the world...

00:03.385 --> 00:04.805
...according to those who built it.

00:05.251 --> 00:09.033
The length of almost two football fields, seven storeys tall,...

00:09.377 --> 00:13.411
...Ark Encounter is crafted according to the Bible's description of Noah's Ark,...

00:14.006 --> 00:16.071
...supposedly built at God's command...

00:16.293 --> 00:18.283
...to escape a flood that drowned the world.

00:18.513 --> 00:20.025
Well, back to my writing.

00:20.173 --> 00:23.844

00:34.562 --> 00:37.797
The vessel also holds models of the animals, two of each kind,...

00:37.859 --> 00:39.050
...that Noah took aboard.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.404
And we've really given people the big picture...

00:41.475 --> 00:43.879
...with an emphasis on the ark and the flood in particular.

00:44.628 --> 00:47.094
These particular believers may be small in numbers,...

00:47.263 --> 00:51.367
...but according to a recent Gallup poll, some four in every ten Americans...

00:51.455 --> 00:55.473
...do agree that the earth was created within the past 10,000 years.
