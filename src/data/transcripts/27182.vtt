Arianna Huffington is no slacker when it comes to work...

00:03.432 --> 00:06.310
...so it's almost surprising to hear the editor-in-chief...

00:06.403 --> 00:10.097
...encourages a designated area to nap in the workplace.

00:10.228 --> 00:12.464
I always knew that woman was a genius.

00:12.627 --> 00:16.437
Huffington says people who are well-rested are actually more productive.

00:16.591 --> 00:20.353
She even wrote a book called "The Sleep Revolution" about the importance of sleep.

00:20.491 --> 00:24.621
Predicting in the next two years, nap areas will be as common as conference rooms.

00:24.784 --> 00:28.877
At least three well-known companies agree and already have a place for snoozing:...

00:29.006 --> 00:31.077
...Google, Zappos and Ben & Jerry's.

00:31.212 --> 00:35.075
Although if I worked at B & J's, I'd be eating so much ice cream during the day,...

00:35.170 --> 00:36.535
...I wouldn't have time for sleep.

00:36.677 --> 00:41.265
Arianna's concept stems from the idea people are perfectly capable of functioning...

00:41.341 --> 00:43.210
...on just four, five hours of shut-eye.

00:43.364 --> 00:46.029
She disagrees and wrote the book to examine the theory...

00:46.135 --> 00:48.840
...to regain control over our out-of-kilter lives.

00:48.931 --> 00:50.791
Napping at work would be so cool!
