Research suggests that America's first in, last out office culture...

00:04.962 --> 00:07.448
...is not leading to improved productivity.

00:07.575 --> 00:11.129
In fact, it is leading to less productivity and poor work.

00:11.284 --> 00:15.259
We've all been told that the key to success is to work harder than anybody.

00:15.362 --> 00:17.606
New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg said,...

00:17.730 --> 00:21.271
"I'm not smarter than anybody else, but I can outwork you."

00:21.363 --> 00:23.947
"And my key to success for you or anyone else..."

00:24.019 --> 00:26.910
"...is to make sure you are the first one in there every day..."

00:27.035 --> 00:28.649
"...and the last one out to leave. "

00:28.817 --> 00:32.183
Entrepreneur Elon Musk also put it pretty succinctly,...

00:32.291 --> 00:35.957
"If someone works 40 hours per week and you work 100 hours per week,..."

00:36.117 --> 00:38.860
"...you'll get what they get out of a year in four months."

00:39.015 --> 00:43.141
But is that really true, taking into account fatigue and distractions?

00:43.237 --> 00:46.623
Maybe the answer is to work smarter, not harder.
