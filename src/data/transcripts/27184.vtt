ï»¿Listen up, babies!

00:14.652 --> 00:15.811
Life's not fair.

00:18.524 --> 00:21.174
You get no say in the world you're born into.

00:23.335 --> 00:24.953
You don't decide your name.

00:26.926 --> 00:28.771
You don't decide where you come from.

00:30.193 --> 00:32.594
You don't decide if you have a place to call home...

00:33.197 --> 00:35.933
...or if your whole family has to leave the country.

00:38.113 --> 00:39.673
Yeah, it's messed up.

00:40.693 --> 00:44.111
You don't decide how the world judges a person like you.

00:46.499 --> 00:49.050
You don't decide how your story begins...

00:49.919 --> 00:53.151
...but you do get to decide how it ends.

00:57.819 --> 00:58.760
Yes!
