00:02.425 --> 00:04.733
These desert ants are on a mission:...

00:05.271 --> 00:09.819
...find food and bring it home no matter the size and shape.

00:10.319 --> 00:13.427
But new research suggests ants walking backwards...

00:13.713 --> 00:18.833
...are as good at navigating to their destination as forward-walking ants.

00:21.780 --> 00:25.374
This means they must somehow measure the length of each stride they take,...

00:25.659 --> 00:30.191
...or use other cues to keep track of their location, the researchers say.

00:31.761 --> 00:35.551
When ants find something too large to be lifted and carried forward,...

00:35.811 --> 00:37.393
...they drag it backwards.

00:37.870 --> 00:42.031
So, the researchers put the ants' reversing navigation skills to the test.

00:42.819 --> 00:45.432
They painted a white grid onto the desert floor...

00:45.711 --> 00:48.335
...and released an ant with a large food crumb,...

00:48.709 --> 00:51.662
...and it began its backward track towards its home.

00:55.161 --> 00:58.517
The research published in the "Journal of Experimental Biology"...

00:58.707 --> 01:00.762
...use high-speed camera recordings.

01:01.043 --> 01:05.074
It found that backward-traveling ants showed surprising flexibility...

01:05.371 --> 01:07.089
...with inter-leg coordination...

01:07.324 --> 01:10.122
...in comparison with the forward-walking ones.
