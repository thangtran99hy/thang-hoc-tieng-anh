I'm Jordan and today I'm assisting at a photo shoot.

00:05.317 --> 00:07.102
I keep track of it all using my Lumia...

00:07.243 --> 00:10.066
...as it allows me to do many different things, all at once.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.921
I'm an aspiring photographer myself...

00:15.339 --> 00:17.320
...and I take pictures whenever I get a chance.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.183
I like the rawness of "behind the scenes" material.

00:21.527 --> 00:23.037
It's just too good not to share.

00:25.206 --> 00:27.834
A lot more goes into a photo shoot than people might think.

00:28.469 --> 00:30.857
You often end up making last-minute changes on the go.

00:32.511 --> 00:34.719
Cortana is my intelligent personal assistant.

00:35.700 --> 00:37.233
He helps me keep my life on track.

00:40.467 --> 00:43.592
Skype comes in handy when I need to call clients in other countries...

00:44.269 --> 00:47.645
...and, I have a few minutes, I might sneak in a quick gaming session...

00:48.154 --> 00:50.686
...but I'm always ready to jump straight back into work.
