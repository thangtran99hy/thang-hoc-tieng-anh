ï»¿Not the best idea if you're scared of heights.

00:04.691 --> 00:07.145
This slide on the side of LA's tallest building...

00:07.199 --> 00:08.700
...has been open to the public,...

00:09.169 --> 00:11.485
...1,000 feet above the streets.

00:13.946 --> 00:17.923
The exciting attraction clings to the outside of the US Bank Tower...

00:18.209 --> 00:22.282
...and is part of the OUE Skyspace LA observation deck.

00:28.145 --> 00:29.973
Thrill seekers will be able to sit down...

00:30.029 --> 00:35.148
...and slide for 45 feet to an outdoor platform on the 69th floor.

00:35.589 --> 00:39.211
According to the building's owner, Singapore-based OUE Limited,...

00:39.571 --> 00:44.259
...the glass on the fully enclosed slide is only one and a quarter inches thick,...

00:44.718 --> 00:47.066
...but can withstand hurricane-force winds...

00:47.299 --> 00:49.245
...and even a powerful earthquake.

00:51.187 --> 00:55.770
We're still not sure, but it is definitely one quick exit from the office.
