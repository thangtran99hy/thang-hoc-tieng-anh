00:00.050 --> 00:03.435
ï»¿US Olympic Committee late Thursday said the behavior of swimmers Ryan Lochte,...

00:03.599 --> 00:07.388
...James Feigen, Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger was not acceptable...

00:07.595 --> 00:09.774
...nor does it represent the values of Team USA.

00:10.002 --> 00:14.039
The USOC statement acknowledging the group was involved in an act of vandalism...

00:14.402 --> 00:17.720
...came after Mr. Lochte's public account of being robbed at gunpoint Sunday...

00:17.826 --> 00:19.603
...was discredited by Rio Police.

00:19.984 --> 00:22.720
Mr. Lochte subsequently changed details of that story,...

00:23.081 --> 00:26.313
...saying the robbery happened at a gas station rather than on the road.

00:26.636 --> 00:29.372
But surveillance camera footage appeared to undermine his account.

00:29.781 --> 00:32.864
Police said armed security guards have detained the group of gold medalists...

00:32.954 --> 00:36.495
...after at least one of the swimmers damaged property in the gas station's restroom.

00:37.008 --> 00:39.951
They were released after they paid about $50 for the damages.

00:40.221 --> 00:42.957
A lawyer for two of the swimmers, Mr. Bentz and Mr. Conger,...

00:43.251 --> 00:46.897
...said his clients didn't understand why Mr. Lochte had claimed they were robbed.

00:50.919 --> 00:53.779
The crowd booed the two swimmers as they made their way to the airport...

00:54.079 --> 00:56.443
...after a judge granted them permission to leave Brazil.

00:57.011 --> 00:59.128
The athletes later boarded a flight to Miami.
