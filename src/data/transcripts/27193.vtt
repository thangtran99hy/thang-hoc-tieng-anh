So, it's a beautiful day in the port of Southampton,...

00:06.179 --> 00:08.533
...and the reason why we are here is because Harmony of the Seas,...

00:08.627 --> 00:12.346
...the world's largest ever cruise ship, has come in to port for the first time.

00:12.575 --> 00:13.713
The best way to describe it is...

00:13.800 --> 00:18.637
...she's sixteen stories tall, 1,200 feet long and really that size gives us...

00:18.853 --> 00:22.488
...an opportunity to fill the ship with an amazing number of amenities...

00:22.663 --> 00:25.301
...to cater for nationalities from around the globe.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.288
Harmony of the Seas brings adventure,...

00:27.549 --> 00:29.755
...the Ultimate Abyss, we've got waterslides.

00:29.895 --> 00:31.377
We've got robotic bars.

00:31.497 --> 00:34.612
We have 23 pools including two FlowRiders.

00:34.707 --> 00:35.933
We've got zip lines.
