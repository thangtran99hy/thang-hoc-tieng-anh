00:00.445 --> 00:02.461
If it's your first time in Barcelona,...

00:02.707 --> 00:07.577
...top of your list has to be the eccentric architecture of Antoni Gaudi.

00:08.163 --> 00:10.197
He drew inspiration from nature,...

00:10.487 --> 00:14.219
...decorating Barcelona with curvy, colorful architecture.

00:16.421 --> 00:20.935
Antoni Gaudi's extraordinary masterpiece is La Sagrada Familia.

00:21.667 --> 00:26.293
Under construction since 1882, this one of a kind cathedral...

00:26.661 --> 00:30.795
...isn't expected to be complete until at least 2026.

00:31.479 --> 00:35.387
Even so, La Sagrada Familia is an awe-inspiring building,...

00:35.761 --> 00:38.146
...towering over the rooftops of Barcelona.

00:39.129 --> 00:41.949
Inside, the cathedral is just as impressive.

00:42.791 --> 00:48.127
Bright, spacious and surreal, it's unlike any other cathedral in the world.
