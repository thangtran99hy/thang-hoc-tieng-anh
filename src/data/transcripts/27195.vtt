Everybody complains about meetings...

00:11.935 --> 00:14.252
...but it can be a really great opportunity to stand out...

00:14.394 --> 00:17.022
...and raise your profile with your boss and your colleagues.

00:17.122 --> 00:19.381
Of course, there is a downside to speaking up in meetings.

00:19.487 --> 00:22.254
You don't want to interrupt people or come across as a blowhard...

00:22.511 --> 00:25.310
...and you could look like a wallflower if you don't say anything at all.

00:25.899 --> 00:27.808
Here's how you can really stand out in meetings.

00:27.999 --> 00:29.413
First, do some prep work.

00:29.493 --> 00:31.343
You've been invited to the meeting for a reason...

00:31.514 --> 00:33.879
...and if you don't know the reason, maybe you shouldn't go to the meeting.

00:34.213 --> 00:37.603
But prepare a few talking points so you don't get nervous about what you're saying...

00:37.719 --> 00:39.031
...and it'll prompt you too.

00:39.555 --> 00:42.904
Like Sheryl Sandberg said, you want to lean in and get a seat at the table.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.221
Put your hands on the table.

00:44.321 --> 00:47.459
You're gonna look more confident and be more involved in the conversation that way.

00:47.747 --> 00:51.043
It's great if you sit across from the most important person in the room.

00:51.149 --> 00:54.319
That way, when they look up, you're gonna be the first person they see.

00:54.585 --> 00:56.733
You want to come across confidently at the meeting.

00:56.887 --> 00:59.801
Speak up and don't undermine yourself with phrases like,...

00:59.913 --> 01:03.579
"Well, this may be a crazy idea" or "This is just my opinion."

01:03.851 --> 01:05.386
Be one of the first people to speak.

01:05.492 --> 01:08.291
If you're nervous, you'll get those butterflies out of your stomach.

01:08.495 --> 01:10.967
And you won't be so worried about what other people say...

01:11.067 --> 01:13.369
...or someone stealing your idea or your thoughts.
