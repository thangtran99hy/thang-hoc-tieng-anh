00:00.576 --> 00:03.174
Here at Stanford University, we're interested in learning...

00:03.267 --> 00:06.825
...about how tiny things move objects much larger than themselves.

00:07.393 --> 00:10.043
Using a special adhesive inspired by gecko toes,...

00:10.436 --> 00:14.124
...our microrobots can move objects over 2,000 times their own weight.

00:14.823 --> 00:18.469
The question is, like ants, can our robots work together...

00:18.561 --> 00:20.053
...to accomplish great things?

00:21.987 --> 00:23.607
After a series of experiments,...

00:23.989 --> 00:27.492
...we found that the best way for robots to work together as a team...

00:27.917 --> 00:32.387
...was to use a very long, very slow, but very steady winching gate,...

00:32.635 --> 00:34.325
...like our team of microrobots here.

00:35.215 --> 00:38.242
With near perfect teamwork and impressive individual strength,...

00:38.882 --> 00:42.739
...this team of six MicroTugs weighing only 100 grams...

00:43.149 --> 00:49.251
...move the author's unmodified 3,900-pound, 1,800-kilogram...

00:49.483 --> 00:52.897
...car and driver, shown here at 20 times speed.
