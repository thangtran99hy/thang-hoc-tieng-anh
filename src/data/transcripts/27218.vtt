ï»¿I got no idea how you piss guys like that off.

00:03.585 --> 00:04.441
What do they want from you?

00:04.779 --> 00:06.644
They worked for my boyfriend.

00:06.909 --> 00:07.990
Please don't hurt her.

00:10.610 --> 00:11.303
I killed him.

00:11.975 --> 00:15.054
Lydia Carson could be travelling with John Link.

00:15.214 --> 00:16.496
That warrant is for me.

00:16.644 --> 00:17.468
You could go home.

00:17.593 --> 00:20.272
You got raised by three stepfathers, should've been me.

00:20.632 --> 00:21.515
I'm a murderer.

00:22.053 --> 00:23.548
And you'll face God for it...

00:24.815 --> 00:25.507
...but not yet.

00:27.421 --> 00:27.700
Go!

00:28.985 --> 00:29.943
Oh my God.

00:33.640 --> 00:35.389
People get caught when they make mistakes.

00:36.673 --> 00:37.490
You stick with me,...

00:38.304 --> 00:39.529
...I'll give you everything I've got.

00:43.805 --> 00:45.396
We can see you right now.

00:47.138 --> 00:48.915
This is the last streak of sunlight you're gonna see.

00:55.233 --> 00:56.477
Whatever you're gonna deal with Lydia,...

00:59.529 --> 01:01.377
...first, you need to deal with me.
