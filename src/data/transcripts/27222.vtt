Hey guys! We are in Asakusa, Tokyo, right now, as you can see.

00:10.395 --> 00:12.355
Today, we would like to take you...

00:12.434 --> 00:16.449
...to the super popular okonomiyaki place near Asakusa.

00:17.403 --> 00:21.732
Even though okonomiyaki in Osaka is more well-known,...

00:22.237 --> 00:25.687
...the restaurant we're going is really in demand.

00:26.361 --> 00:28.324
So let's go and check it out.

00:30.661 --> 00:34.710
On the way going to the restaurant, we see this amazing Sensoji temple,...

00:35.230 --> 00:37.799
...which is one of Tokyo's oldest temples.

00:38.481 --> 00:40.511
It is the most popular attraction...

00:40.576 --> 00:44.069
...among both Japanese locals and foreign visitors.

00:44.859 --> 00:49.387
Japan's temples are famous for their vivid history and unique decoration,...

00:49.923 --> 00:54.239
...and at Sensoji, you are always able to find delicious local snacks...

00:54.388 --> 00:56.713
...and interesting Japanese souvenirs.
