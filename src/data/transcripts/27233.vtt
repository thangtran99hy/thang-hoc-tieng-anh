00:02.048 --> 00:04.068
For me, it all began with a boy.

00:04.951 --> 00:05.863
His name was Ethan.

00:06.089 --> 00:07.188
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.

00:07.362 --> 00:09.453
My name was Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.

00:11.819 --> 00:12.181
No!

00:13.338 --> 00:14.589
As the years went by,...

00:15.217 --> 00:17.545
...I could tell my time with Ethan was coming to an end.

00:17.975 --> 00:18.733
Good boy, Bailey.

00:19.846 --> 00:20.254
I'll miss you.

00:21.363 --> 00:22.921
And then, it happened.

00:23.897 --> 00:24.507
I was back.

00:25.058 --> 00:25.815
I didn't have a...

00:26.451 --> 00:26.969
I'm a girl?!

00:27.301 --> 00:28.455
Good girl, good girl.

00:29.235 --> 00:30.601
I had a new purpose.

00:30.858 --> 00:31.789
I was needed again,...

00:33.643 --> 00:34.169
...and again,...

00:35.275 --> 00:35.807
...and again.

00:36.135 --> 00:37.072
Hi, you.

00:37.156 --> 00:40.603
With each new life, I was learning a new lesson.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.041
Have we met before?

00:47.318 --> 00:48.920
Where did you find that?

00:49.329 --> 00:50.235
Okay, ready?

00:51.027 --> 00:51.248
Go!

00:56.995 --> 00:59.589
I tried to make sense out of all the things I've seen.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.285
Was there a point to this journey of mine?

01:02.971 --> 01:04.188
And how did bacon fit in?

01:13.821 --> 01:15.712
If I can get you licking and loving,...

01:16.748 --> 01:17.797
...I have my purpose.
