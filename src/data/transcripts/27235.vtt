ï»¿Hey Maria!

00:03.936 --> 00:05.087
Are you okay?

00:07.161 --> 00:08.529
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:09.483 --> 00:14.615
I'm just trying to build the tallest block tower, but it keeps falling down.

00:16.246 --> 00:20.718
Here if you put more blocks at the bottom you can build higher.

00:22.544 --> 00:26.481
Hey, this is much taller than I had before.

00:28.209 --> 00:30.233
Just one block left.

00:33.443 --> 00:34.101
Hey guys!

00:34.655 --> 00:37.121
We're building the tallest tower ever.

00:38.098 --> 00:38.617
Can I help?

00:39.237 --> 00:39.745
Sure.

00:40.516 --> 00:41.343
What can I do?

00:41.914 --> 00:48.297
Well, I want to get the very last brick on top, but it's too high for me.

00:49.983 --> 00:52.570
I know, I can hold the step stool for you.

00:53.404 --> 00:54.256
So, you're safe.

00:54.969 --> 00:55.363
Okay.

01:04.359 --> 01:05.243
Yay!

01:06.267 --> 01:08.297
It's amazing.

01:08.881 --> 01:11.003
It's beautiful.

01:11.757 --> 01:13.461
It was a group effort
