ï»¿Facebook has 1.65 billion users.

00:02.889 --> 00:05.997
In order to continue to grow, they need to have other properties.

00:06.424 --> 00:10.177
They acquired Instagram for 700 million around the time of their IPO.

00:10.334 --> 00:13.809
A couple years later, they acquired WhatsApp for 22 billion.

00:14.449 --> 00:19.539
They also spun off Messenger, the Facebook chat service into its own app.

00:19.759 --> 00:23.755
This multi-app strategy is helping Facebook think of other ways...

00:23.862 --> 00:25.948
...to generate revenue beyond the main app.

00:26.629 --> 00:30.481
Now, Facebook makes more than 80 percent of its revenue from mobile,...

00:30.853 --> 00:34.089
...up from zero at the time of its IPO prospectus.

00:34.345 --> 00:37.959
So, that's really driven this growth in Facebook stock...

00:38.040 --> 00:40.529
...and it's now more than triple its IPO value.

00:40.987 --> 00:43.630
When companies are growing as fast as Facebook is,...

00:43.741 --> 00:46.107
...it's very easy to forgive their mistakes.

00:46.223 --> 00:49.268
They've had some apps that never got off the ground,...

00:49.364 --> 00:51.401
...some acquisitions that never got done...

00:51.554 --> 00:54.909
...but as long as the revenue keeps growing to record highs,...

00:55.133 --> 00:57.219
...Wall Street's gonna turn a blind eye and say,...

00:57.472 --> 00:58.970
"Zuckerberg, do whatever you want."
