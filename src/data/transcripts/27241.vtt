ï»¿You're telling a friend an amazing story and you just get to the best part...

00:11.527 --> 00:16.497
...when suddenly, he interrupts, "The alien and I, not me and the alien."

00:17.665 --> 00:19.413
Most of us would probably be annoyed,...

00:19.891 --> 00:23.208
...but aside from the rude interruption, does your friend have a point?

00:23.774 --> 00:26.539
Was your sentence actually grammatically incorrect?

00:27.000 --> 00:30.353
And if he still understood it, why does it even matter?

00:31.143 --> 00:32.694
From the point of view of linguistics,...

00:32.965 --> 00:36.532
...grammar is a set of patterns for how words are put together...

00:36.783 --> 00:40.767
...to form phrases or clauses, whether spoken or in writing.

00:41.965 --> 00:43.793
Different languages have different patterns.

00:44.409 --> 00:47.253
In English, the subject normally comes first,...

00:47.577 --> 00:49.735
...followed by the verb and then the object.

00:50.159 --> 00:52.555
While in Japanese and many other languages,...

00:52.851 --> 00:55.215
...the order is subject, object, verb.

00:55.771 --> 00:59.957
Some scholars have tried to identify patterns common to all languages,...

01:00.409 --> 01:04.226
...but apart from some basic features, like having nouns or verbs,...

01:04.621 --> 01:08.320
...few of these so-called "linguistic universals" have been found.

01:08.827 --> 01:11.847
And while any language needs consistent patterns to function,...

01:12.165 --> 01:15.479
...the study of these patterns opens up an ongoing debate...

01:15.856 --> 01:19.975
...between two positions known as prescriptivism and deprescriptivism.

01:20.757 --> 01:24.253
Grossly simplified, prescriptivists think a given language...

01:24.305 --> 01:28.585
...should follow consistent rules, while descriptivists see variation...

01:28.643 --> 01:32.386
...and adaptation as a natural and necessary part of language.
