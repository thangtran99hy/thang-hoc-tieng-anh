00:00.304 --> 00:01.639
I like for you to be still.

00:03.231 --> 00:04.429
It is as though you are absent....

00:05.631 --> 00:08.825
...and you hear me from far away and my voice does not touch you.

00:10.359 --> 00:12.632
It seems as though your eyes had flown away...

00:12.710 --> 00:15.039
...and it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth.

00:17.047 --> 00:19.042
As all things are filled with my soul,...

00:19.101 --> 00:22.063
...you emerge from the things filled with my soul.

00:23.825 --> 00:27.339
You are like my soul, a butterfly of dream,...

00:28.546 --> 00:32.017
...and you are like the word "melancholy".

00:34.196 --> 00:37.769
I like for you to be still and you seem far away.
