We focus on safety, specifically for our demographic: women.

00:04.414 --> 00:06.847
So women really feel safe on our system.

00:06.946 --> 00:10.133
Eighty percent of, many of our users in many cities are women...

00:10.733 --> 00:14.035
...because they feel that this system can be tracked, it can be shared...

00:14.467 --> 00:17.914
...so their husbands, their boyfriends, their fathers can track them...

00:18.334 --> 00:22.243
...as they go home safely. So, that was the social front.

00:23.004 --> 00:27.306
You're in five and you said soon-to-be six Southeast Asian countries.

00:27.717 --> 00:31.704
Talk to us a little bit about what is Southeast Asia, why is it different...

00:31.760 --> 00:36.333
...and this is sort of what makes you guys different from San Francisco.

00:36.697 --> 00:38.225
One of the features is cash.

00:39.960 --> 00:42.879
In the other apps, there are options of paying credit card.

00:43.142 --> 00:46.297
In our case, we understand that, in the 600 million population,...

00:46.692 --> 00:50.180
...a small, small slice of people are using credit card...

00:50.597 --> 00:52.341
...so majority of people use cash.
