00:07.267 --> 00:11.126
Here comes the teenage sensation Usain Bolt, speeding down the stretch.

00:11.399 --> 00:13.803
Oh my God, look at this kid!

00:13.945 --> 00:14.885
Usain Bolt is on his way.

00:15.059 --> 00:16.646
The other men are trying to follow as best they can.

00:17.221 --> 00:19.746
This youngster is absolutely incredible!

00:19.917 --> 00:21.081
...towards the finish line.

00:21.351 --> 00:22.411
He's doing it again.

00:22.543 --> 00:23.402
He wins!

00:23.762 --> 00:25.273
He wins again!

00:25.509 --> 00:25.798
He wins!

00:29.695 --> 00:30.373
Win.

00:32.771 --> 00:33.482
Win.

00:33.687 --> 00:35.114
Win.

00:40.422 --> 00:41.906
What's the matter, Usain?

00:43.287 --> 00:44.241
What if I don't win?

00:44.848 --> 00:46.147
What if you don't win?

00:47.111 --> 00:49.369
Since when did you become so serious, boy?

00:49.860 --> 00:51.889
Don't make me go out there, mama, please.

00:52.953 --> 00:54.401
Look at yourself, Usain.

00:55.325 --> 00:57.010
You're worried about the big race,...

00:57.316 --> 00:59.037
...worried about the big crowd out there.

00:59.633 --> 01:01.265
So many worries on your mind that you forgot...

01:01.326 --> 01:02.995
...which shoe goes on which foot.

01:05.215 --> 01:06.989
Maybe you forgot who you are, too.

01:08.459 --> 01:10.932
The boy I know has no worries...

01:11.575 --> 01:14.563
...because all worries ever do is weigh you down.

01:15.503 --> 01:17.431
Usain, you have to remember,...

01:17.939 --> 01:23.011
...you can always go faster when you keep it light, you see.

01:25.208 --> 01:27.169
Okay. No worries, mama.
