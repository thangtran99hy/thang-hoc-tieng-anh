If you're a teenager and you're fighting your own biology...

00:03.039 --> 00:06.129
...by having to go to bed at night earlier than you want to,...

00:06.671 --> 00:08.743
...luckily there's a lot of things that you can do...

00:09.020 --> 00:12.141
...to help you win that battle over your biology.

00:17.557 --> 00:19.785
It's really important to get bright light...

00:19.981 --> 00:23.100
...particularly in the morning but even in the early afternoon.

00:23.545 --> 00:27.239
And this doesn't have to be hours and hours, just 10 minutes helps.

00:27.619 --> 00:29.217
Even when the sun isn't shining,...

00:29.881 --> 00:33.050
...you'll still get brighter light than just sitting inside all day.

00:39.675 --> 00:42.315
Another thing that you can be mindful of during the day...

00:42.740 --> 00:46.677
...is that you're not too busy and stressed the entire day...

00:46.949 --> 00:48.617
...without taking small breaks.

00:48.845 --> 00:53.123
They can even be super short, it could just be three deep breaths.

00:53.495 --> 00:55.888
And this could be, for instance, when you go to the bathroom...

00:56.168 --> 00:59.877
...or whenever you walk to your car, taking a step back...

01:00.465 --> 01:02.476
...and letting your stress levels go down again.
