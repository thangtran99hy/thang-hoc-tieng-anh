ï»¿Stepping on Socotra Island is like setting foot on an alien landscape.

00:08.347 --> 00:11.327
This place is one of the most isolated landforms on Earth.

00:12.004 --> 00:14.249
Located in the Arabian Sea south of Yemen,...

00:14.775 --> 00:16.939
...the island separated from the mainland of Africa...

00:17.108 --> 00:19.501
...between six and seven million years ago.

00:23.204 --> 00:25.977
There are nearly 700 endemic species on Socotra...

00:26.281 --> 00:28.336
...that are found nowhere else on the planet.

00:30.215 --> 00:34.441
Perhaps the most head-turning of Socotra's species is the Dragon's Blood tree.

00:35.009 --> 00:37.617
These strange umbrella-shaped trees dot the island.

00:38.461 --> 00:42.521
Its top-heavy design is actually an adaptation to Socotra's arid climate.

00:43.106 --> 00:46.913
The large green crown provides shade, which reduces evaporation...

00:47.097 --> 00:49.151
...in a place that sees very little rainfall.

00:51.187 --> 00:55.507
This otherworldly gem has experienced threats to its ecology from human development,...

00:56.105 --> 00:58.539
...but the United Nations stepped in in 2008,...

00:59.137 --> 01:01.361
...designating it as a UNESCO heritage site.
