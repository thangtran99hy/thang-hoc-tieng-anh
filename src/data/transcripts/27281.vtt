This week, we're telling you about a tattoo that can give you a robot.

00:10.297 --> 00:14.495
MIT and Microsoft revealed DuoSkin this past weekend,...

00:14.819 --> 00:19.256
...a gold leaf temporary tattoo that wearers can interact with.

00:19.731 --> 00:23.127
The circuits can be designed in standard image designing software...

00:23.499 --> 00:26.705
...and then printed directly to cheap, temporary tattoo paper.

00:27.259 --> 00:29.089
The video shows off four ways to use them:...

00:29.217 --> 00:32.088
...as touch-sensitive input for tapping and sliding...

00:32.410 --> 00:34.701
...that controls an object on a nearby display,...

00:35.153 --> 00:38.547
...a thermochromic tattoo that changes color and design...

00:38.635 --> 00:40.385
...if the wearers' body temperature rises,...

00:40.870 --> 00:44.989
...a wireless communication device that can be paired with tech like NFC,...

00:45.384 --> 00:48.940
...and a purely aesthetic tattoo jewelry necklace...

00:49.333 --> 00:51.692
...with light-up LEDs embedded within.

00:51.991 --> 00:54.973
The designs are beautiful but they're also inexpensive...

00:55.109 --> 00:59.497
...and a 3x4 cm NFC tattoo costs less than $3.
