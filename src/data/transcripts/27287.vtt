Hi, I'm Thomas Farley, otherwise known as "Mister Manners"...

00:03.354 --> 00:04.981
...and I'm an etiquette expert...

00:05.112 --> 00:08.300
...who does workshops for corporations around the country,...

00:08.387 --> 00:11.968
...teaching people to be more professional in the way they act at work.

00:12.299 --> 00:15.081
I think a big thing that's changed today versus how it used to be...

00:15.203 --> 00:18.345
...is the fact that most of us are working in open office spaces...

00:18.460 --> 00:22.246
...so you really gotta be mindful of how your actions at your own desk...

00:22.611 --> 00:24.043
...are affecting everybody around you.

00:24.129 --> 00:26.485
And that could be anything from the food you eat,...

00:26.678 --> 00:30.762
...to the noise you're making when you're on the telephone, to the way you keep your desk.

00:31.036 --> 00:34.838
A few of the things that are not always practiced, number one is noise level.

00:35.056 --> 00:37.925
If you're on the telephone, you really should keep your volume down,...

00:38.444 --> 00:40.899
...not just because you don't want people hearing what you're saying,...

00:41.025 --> 00:43.152
...but also if you're taking a lot of personal phone calls,...

00:43.561 --> 00:46.088
...you don't wanna be seen as the person who's constantly on the phone...

00:46.193 --> 00:48.227
...handling personal stuff on company time.

00:48.456 --> 00:50.359
The second thing is food smells.

00:50.450 --> 00:52.208
Yay that you're eating your lunch at work...

00:52.317 --> 00:54.663
...but the fact that you're eating a smelly sandwich,...

00:54.783 --> 00:56.200
...a messy sandwich at your desk,...

00:56.341 --> 00:58.209
...you're really involving everybody else around you...

00:58.337 --> 01:00.491
...in ways they probably would rather not be involved.

01:00.703 --> 01:03.145
If you got lunch and you're eating it at your desk,...

01:03.342 --> 01:05.864
...try to keep it to something that's a little bit more scent neutral.

01:06.523 --> 01:10.314
And otherwise, if you prefer a more spicy food that's a little stinkier,...

01:10.593 --> 01:13.839
...you might wanna be eating that outside the office and not at your desk.
