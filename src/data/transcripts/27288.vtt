Richard Perry Loving, being a white person,...

00:05.003 --> 00:07.829
...and Mildred Jeter, being a colored person,...

00:07.995 --> 00:10.667
...did unlawfully cohabitate as man and wife.

00:10.792 --> 00:11.278
Richard!

00:11.363 --> 00:12.113
That ain't right!

00:13.886 --> 00:17.537
I believe this is a battle that could go all the way to the Supreme Court.

00:17.637 --> 00:18.754
But we ain't hurting anybody.

00:19.857 --> 00:21.252
The State of Virginia will argue...

00:21.331 --> 00:24.559
...that it is unfair to bring children of mixed race into the world.

00:26.103 --> 00:27.378
Tell that woman to come out here.

00:31.101 --> 00:32.557
I will raise my family here.

00:33.755 --> 00:35.412
I don't care what they do to us.

00:35.521 --> 00:36.390
Get Peggy inside!

00:38.480 --> 00:39.957
I can take care of you.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.314
I know that.

00:45.299 --> 00:46.593
I can take care of you.

00:53.538 --> 00:55.019
I know we have some enemies.

00:55.993 --> 00:57.414
But we have some friends, too.

01:01.112 --> 01:04.424
You realize this case could alter the Constitution of the United States?

01:05.411 --> 01:06.265
You think you'll lose?

01:07.491 --> 01:11.740
We may lose the small battles but win the big war.

01:15.139 --> 01:16.224
Is there anything you'd like me to say...

01:16.295 --> 01:18.736
...to the Supreme Court Justices of the United States?

01:19.750 --> 01:20.003
Yeah.

01:22.649 --> 01:24.240
You tell the judge I love my wife.
