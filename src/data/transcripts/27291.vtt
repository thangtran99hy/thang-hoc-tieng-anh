ï»¿Now that you have had some time to reflect,...

00:03.234 --> 00:07.005
...give us your memories of that US Open Finals against Cilic,...

00:07.316 --> 00:09.335
...not only the magnitude of the moment...

00:09.784 --> 00:13.319
...but what would you have changed in order to be champion right now?

00:14.937 --> 00:18.077
One day before I was a little bit like, too much excited...

00:18.205 --> 00:21.991
... and I couldn't really sleep and I was a little bit nervous,...

00:22.589 --> 00:24.913
...I have to say, during the match.

00:25.818 --> 00:28.673
But obviously, Cilic played unbelievably well...

00:28.801 --> 00:32.533
...and great serves, great strokes and pretty aggressive too.

00:32.723 --> 00:38.654
So, I couldn't do really nothing but there were some positive things, too.

00:39.776 --> 00:42.641
I played really well until the final...

00:42.753 --> 00:49.599
...and I got overconfident so I hope I can come back in the finals sometime.

00:50.459 --> 00:54.192
Well, what about how your life will change now, moving forward?

00:54.275 --> 00:56.847
Do you feel even more pressure to succeed...

00:56.909 --> 01:00.224
...or has this given you more confidence or is it a little bit of both?

01:02.445 --> 01:06.689
I don't think it will change much of my status outside.

01:07.585 --> 01:11.372
I went back to Japan before, a couple of days, it was a little bit crazy.

01:11.433 --> 01:15.777
A lot of people congratulated me and there were a lot of people who showed up.

01:17.825 --> 01:22.265
I got more, a lot of confidence, to beat a lot of top ten guys,...

01:22.978 --> 01:27.567
...three top ten guys: Raonic, Stan and also Djokovic, too.

01:29.007 --> 01:30.463
You know, I gained more confidence.

01:31.033 --> 01:31.599
That's excellent.

01:31.705 --> 01:35.729
It was also just the first time that anyone can remember...

01:35.785 --> 01:40.179
...that someone named Djokovic, Federer, Nadal or Murray...

01:40.519 --> 01:43.195
...was not going to win a major trophy.

01:43.515 --> 01:45.141
Now, with your run to the final,...

01:45.253 --> 01:49.031
...do you think we'll see more players like yourself getting a chance?

01:50.652 --> 01:51.672
I think so, yes.

01:52.889 --> 01:55.845
You see, Stan won the Australian Open this year and...

01:57.337 --> 02:00.075
It was a little bit weird, with me and Cilic in the final,...

02:00.169 --> 02:06.091
...but a lot of young guys are coming up, Raonic, Dimitrov...

02:06.271 --> 02:11.236
...and also Nick went to semi or quarterfinals in Wimbledon.

02:11.396 --> 02:14.750
And it's great to see for the ATP,...

02:14.965 --> 02:18.355
...for, that a lot of young guys are coming up.
