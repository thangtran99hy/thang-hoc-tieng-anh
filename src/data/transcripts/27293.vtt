00:03.401 --> 00:10.593
We fell in love on the first night that we met.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.392
Together, we've been happy.

00:14.673 --> 00:17.949
I have very few regrets.

00:18.713 --> 00:25.277
The ordinary problems have not been hard to face.

00:25.871 --> 00:32.355
But lately little changes have been slowly taking place.

00:32.920 --> 00:38.967
You're always finding something is wrong in what I do.

00:39.669 --> 00:46.706
But you can't rearrange my life because it pleases you.

00:47.243 --> 00:54.971
You've got to love me for what I am, for simply being me.

00:55.573 --> 01:02.237
Don't love me for what you intend or hope that I will be.

01:02.817 --> 01:09.159
And if you're only using me to feed your fantasy,...

01:09.651 --> 01:15.313
...you're really not in love so let me go.

01:15.842 --> 01:21.153
I must be free.
