Deep in the Namibian desert is a place time forgot.

00:16.087 --> 00:20.745
Once a German colony, miners flocked here after diamonds were discovered in 1908.

00:21.345 --> 00:22.533
The town grew quickly,...

00:23.213 --> 00:27.405
...fueled by the enormous wealth hidden beneath the sands.

00:29.113 --> 00:32.075
But as the diamonds disappeared and production relocated,...

00:32.385 --> 00:34.347
...the town was left completely abandoned...

00:35.293 --> 00:37.916
...to be slowly consumed by the ever-shifting desert.
