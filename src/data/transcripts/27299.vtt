The Dubai city tour is an excellent way to get a lay of the land.

00:04.339 --> 00:08.005
It starts at The Palm, where you see all the access at the Atlantis,...

00:08.106 --> 00:10.083
...and then it goes across the city.

00:10.666 --> 00:12.037
And now we're in the old city,...

00:12.155 --> 00:14.407
...where you're hearing all the call to prayer is going on.

00:14.478 --> 00:16.101
It's just like being back in time.

00:18.677 --> 00:22.061
The second stop on our Dubai city tour is the Burj Al Arab.

00:22.172 --> 00:25.425
It's a seven-star resort and it's pretty spectacular to see.

00:25.933 --> 00:28.737
Who would have thought that there is such an old feel here...

00:28.815 --> 00:30.410
...in the modern city of Dubai?

00:33.373 --> 00:36.607
One final thing that you have to do is go up the Burj Khalifa.

00:36.734 --> 00:38.870
It's the tallest structure in the world...

00:39.029 --> 00:41.247
...and the view from there is spectacular.
