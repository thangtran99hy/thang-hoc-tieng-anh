00:04.883 --> 00:08.794
Like a small boat on the ocean...

00:10.269 --> 00:14.279
...sending big waves into motion,...

00:15.319 --> 00:20.461
...like how a single word can make a heart open,...

00:21.253 --> 00:25.746
...I might only have one match but I can make an explosion.

00:26.850 --> 00:29.367
And all those things I didn't say,...

00:29.713 --> 00:32.201
...wrecking balls inside my brain.

00:32.469 --> 00:34.837
I will scream them loud tonight.

00:35.171 --> 00:37.531
Can you hear my voice this time?

00:37.587 --> 00:39.832
This is our fight song,...

00:40.243 --> 00:42.585
...take back our life song,...

00:43.009 --> 00:47.428
...prove we're alright song.

00:48.481 --> 00:50.602
My power's turned on.

00:50.668 --> 00:53.407
Starting right now, I'll be strong.

00:53.948 --> 00:56.223
I'll play my fight song...

00:57.377 --> 01:02.397
...and I don't really care if nobody else believes.

01:03.018 --> 01:06.441
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me.
