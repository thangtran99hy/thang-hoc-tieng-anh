00:13.106 --> 00:16.529

00:16.639 --> 00:21.743
Darling, he can't buy my love, it's you I'm dreaming of.

00:22.641 --> 00:29.067
They try to romance me but you've got that nasty and that's what I want.

00:30.431 --> 00:34.980
So baby, baby, come and save me.

00:35.108 --> 00:40.317
Don't need those other numbers when I got my number one.

00:49.451 --> 00:53.633
I tried to find somebody new.

00:53.955 --> 00:58.167
Baby, they ain't got a clue, can't love me like you.
