00:04.240 --> 00:08.420
For all the times that you would rain on my parade,...

00:09.415 --> 00:13.137
...and all the clubs you get in using my name.

00:14.173 --> 00:18.007
You think you broke my heart, oh boy, for goodness' sake.

00:18.842 --> 00:22.393
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't.

00:23.522 --> 00:25.494
And I didn't wanna write a song...

00:25.854 --> 00:29.741
...'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care, I don't...

00:29.810 --> 00:32.473
...but you still hit my phone up.

00:33.217 --> 00:35.105
And baby, I'll be moving on.

00:35.455 --> 00:39.618
And I think you should be something I don't wanna hold back.

00:39.987 --> 00:42.234
Maybe you should know that.

00:42.738 --> 00:46.403
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone.

00:47.424 --> 00:51.078
And I never like to admit that I was wrong.

00:52.143 --> 00:57.009
I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on...

00:57.095 --> 01:01.908
...and now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own.

01:01.977 --> 01:06.494
'Cause if you like the way you look that much,...

01:06.713 --> 01:10.256
...oh baby, you should go and love yourself.

01:11.422 --> 01:16.998
And if you think that I'm still holding on to something,...

01:17.065 --> 01:19.865
...you should go and love yourself.
