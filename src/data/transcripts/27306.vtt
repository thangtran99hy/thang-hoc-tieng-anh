00:06.517 --> 00:09.523
Just for a moment, focus on your breath.

00:10.123 --> 00:15.378
In slowly, out slowly, in slowly, out.

00:16.335 --> 00:19.215
The same pattern repeats within every one of us.

00:19.622 --> 00:20.949
And consider your pulse.

00:21.697 --> 00:24.581
The beat is built into the very fabric of our being.

00:25.198 --> 00:28.516
Simply put, we are creatures of rhythm and repetition.

00:29.009 --> 00:32.429
It's central to our experience, rhythm and repetition.

00:32.910 --> 00:34.314
Rhythm and repetition.

00:34.879 --> 00:37.782
On and in and on and out.

00:38.138 --> 00:39.425
Pattern can be pleasure.

00:40.306 --> 00:45.545
In language, rhythm and repetition are often used as the building blocks for poetry.

00:46.298 --> 00:51.565
There's the rhythm of language, created by syllables and their emphasis, such as,...

00:51.883 --> 00:55.623
..."So long as men can breathe or eyes can see."

00:56.633 --> 00:59.495
And there's the repetition of language at multiple levels.

00:59.871 --> 01:00.979
The repetition of letters,...

01:01.517 --> 01:04.326
..."So long lives this and this gives life to thee,"...

01:04.804 --> 01:09.507
...of sounds, "breathe," "see," "thee," and of words.

01:10.093 --> 01:15.455
With so many uses, repetition is one of the poet's most malleable and reliable tools.

01:16.178 --> 01:18.287
It can lift or lull the listener,...

01:18.636 --> 01:20.584
...amplify or diminish the line,...

01:21.092 --> 01:23.549
...unify or diversify ideas.

01:24.473 --> 01:27.176
Ultimately, this is the poet's balancing act:...

01:27.523 --> 01:29.582
...learning when to repeat and when to riff,...

01:29.872 --> 01:33.408
...when to satisfy expectations and when to thwart them.

01:34.367 --> 01:36.829
And in that balance, it may be enough to remember,...

01:37.097 --> 01:39.817
...we all live in a world of wild variation...

01:40.185 --> 01:42.499
...and carry with us our own breath and beat,...

01:42.833 --> 01:45.116
...our own repetition wherever we go.
