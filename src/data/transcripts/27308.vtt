00:03.615 --> 00:08.036
If I should die, think only this of me:...

00:09.973 --> 00:18.451
...that there's some corner of a foreign field that is forever England.

00:19.767 --> 00:27.589
And there shall be in that rich earth a richer dust concealed,...

00:28.286 --> 00:33.156
...a dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,...

00:34.284 --> 00:37.127
...gave once her flowers to love, her ways to roam.

00:38.145 --> 00:43.461
A body of England's breathing English air,...

00:45.164 --> 00:49.532
...washed by the rivers, blessed by sons of home.

00:50.909 --> 00:56.867
And think this heart, all evil shed away,...

00:57.387 --> 01:01.073
...a pulse in the eternal mind no less,...

01:01.359 --> 01:04.427
...give somewhere back the thoughts by England given.

01:05.424 --> 01:09.624
Her sights and sounds, dreams happy as her day,...

01:09.682 --> 01:14.170
...and laughter learnt of friends...

01:14.325 --> 01:23.892
...and gentleness in hearts at peace, under an English heaven.
