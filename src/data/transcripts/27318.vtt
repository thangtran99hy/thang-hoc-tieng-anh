ï»¿If I get a text, I look at my phone.

00:01.476 --> 00:02.678
It's definitely texting.

00:02.848 --> 00:04.333
Instagram, Twitter, Facebook.

00:04.414 --> 00:05.074
Snapchat.

00:05.194 --> 00:06.855
I do Snapchat and drive sometimes.

00:07.138 --> 00:08.411
Justin, nice to meet you.

00:08.487 --> 00:09.190
Nice to meet you.

00:09.577 --> 00:13.319
I just really quickly wanna have a chat to tell you what happened to me.

00:13.647 --> 00:19.703
When I was 21 years old, driving home from my college graduation ceremony,...

00:20.787 --> 00:24.133
...a driver on his phone was so distracted,...

00:24.249 --> 00:27.167
...he turned left into the intersection at a red light.

00:27.647 --> 00:33.391
Another car, an 18-wheeler, swerved to miss him and hit my family's car.

00:33.998 --> 00:38.765
The resulting collision actually killed both of my parents.

00:39.675 --> 00:43.827
I spent two months in the hospital fighting for my own life...

00:44.063 --> 00:47.287
...and then two more months in a rehab hospital.

00:48.195 --> 00:50.289
Honestly, if I have been sitting at a red light,...

00:50.383 --> 00:52.521
...I'll like, glance down to see if my mom's texting me,...

00:52.593 --> 00:56.391
...but the people's lives that are impacted from something that's so stupid...

01:03.701 --> 01:06.403
I can assure you on my drive home right now,...

01:06.496 --> 01:09.077
...I'm not going to use my phone and drive.

01:09.550 --> 01:12.008
And I'm not gonna do it when I go to work tomorrow...

01:12.167 --> 01:17.225
...and the next day after that, until it becomes a habit and it just doesn't happen at all.
