This is Sade and this is Linah, two young servals.

00:08.935 --> 00:13.344
These slender, medium-size cats are native to sub-Saharan Africa,...

00:13.514 --> 00:16.808
...and have a gorgeous golden coat with black spots.

00:17.263 --> 00:22.041
Servals have the longest legs of any cat relative to body size.

00:22.483 --> 00:27.799
Their ears are also impressively large, and can rotate 180 degrees,...

00:27.933 --> 00:29.833
...giving them a keen sense of hearing,...

00:30.004 --> 00:32.487
...which helps them locate prey efficiently.

00:33.034 --> 00:36.901
They're long, lean and can jump up to nine feet in the air,...

00:37.106 --> 00:39.858
...to catch unsuspecting birds flying by.

00:40.583 --> 00:45.487
Beyond birds, they mostly feed on rodents, insects and reptiles.

00:46.196 --> 00:50.573
Servals prefer wetlands and areas with tall grasses near water.

00:51.472 --> 00:56.778
Unfortunately, degradation of these wetlands is leaving them with less and less space,...

00:57.168 --> 01:00.895
...while hunting for their prized coat remains a big concern.

01:01.706 --> 01:03.266
This is the serval.
