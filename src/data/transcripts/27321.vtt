ï»¿I'm Ryan, I'm 14.

00:06.239 --> 00:07.281
I'm Alex, I'm 12.

00:07.887 --> 00:09.167
Welcome to our crib!

00:12.912 --> 00:14.233
This is where all the fishing happens.

00:21.085 --> 00:22.657
This over here is an underwater theme.

00:23.021 --> 00:24.475
I chose this because I love fishing.

00:25.077 --> 00:26.385
This is a sunken ship.

00:27.065 --> 00:27.839
This is where I sleep.

00:29.461 --> 00:31.855
These three fish are my three favorite fish.

00:32.175 --> 00:32.899
Redfish.

00:33.390 --> 00:33.919
Snook.

00:34.251 --> 00:35.449
Tarpon eating small fish.

00:35.750 --> 00:38.016
There's a guy up there trying to catch a tarpon with a lure.

00:38.379 --> 00:38.903
Redfish.

00:39.118 --> 00:39.528
Tarpon.

00:39.737 --> 00:40.395
Another tarpon.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.049
That's me and a trout.

00:43.137 --> 00:44.943
That tree over there is a mangrove tree.

00:45.242 --> 00:49.482
It's common in Florida and there's usually a vast cornucopia of fish over there.

00:49.917 --> 00:51.515
Over here is my treasure chest.

00:52.388 --> 00:53.941
This is where I store my valuables.

00:54.308 --> 00:56.061
And there's a hidden light over here.

00:58.375 --> 00:59.702
It turns on the dock lights.

01:00.693 --> 01:01.863
And this is my desk.

01:01.961 --> 01:03.439
I do most of my homework here.

01:04.062 --> 01:05.835
And that's my brother, Alex.
