00:00.704 --> 00:02.671
By now, you've heard the bad news.

00:02.987 --> 00:07.049
Those finks at Apple removed the headphone jack from the new iPhone 7.

00:07.677 --> 00:08.457
Here's the good news.

00:08.559 --> 00:11.883
They filled that space with precious, life-sustaining battery...

00:12.297 --> 00:15.748
...and a bunch of other useful stuff, like a much better camera,...

00:16.028 --> 00:18.442
...which we used to film this entire video.

00:19.170 --> 00:20.904
Testing the 7 and 7 Plus for a week,...

00:21.195 --> 00:24.213
...I found Apple has fixed some of what's long ailed the iPhone,...

00:24.464 --> 00:27.991
...and that's reason enough to get over the headphone thing and upgrade.

00:28.647 --> 00:29.707
Let me be clear.

00:30.101 --> 00:33.410
The iPhone 7 is not the most advanced smartphone money can buy.

00:33.879 --> 00:36.882
I'd say it's the best smartphone of 2015.

00:37.292 --> 00:40.789
That's when Apple should have put it on sale instead of the iPhone 6s...

00:41.121 --> 00:43.729
...that added frivolous stuff like a pressure sensitive screen.

00:44.829 --> 00:48.933
Apple's still playing catch-up with the 6-month-old Samsung Galaxy S7.

00:49.422 --> 00:53.707
While Samsung has moved on to incredible edgeless screens and virtual reality goggles,...

00:53.882 --> 00:58.795
...this iPhone 7 looks, well, pretty much identical to the two-year-old iPhone 6,...

00:58.975 --> 01:03.211
...aside from a new shiny, black finish that's an incredible fingerprint magnet.
