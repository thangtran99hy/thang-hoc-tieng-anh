00:06.829 --> 00:09.798
Sunday morning, rain is falling.

00:12.265 --> 00:14.913
Steal some covers, share some skin.

00:17.890 --> 00:22.222
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable,...

00:22.611 --> 00:26.074
...you twist to fit the mold that I am in.

00:27.836 --> 00:32.271
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do.

00:32.937 --> 00:37.481
I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew...

00:38.750 --> 00:42.255
...that someday it would lead me back to you,...

00:44.133 --> 00:47.461
...that someday it would lead me back to you.

00:48.863 --> 00:53.198
That may be all I need,...

00:53.767 --> 00:58.537
...in darkness she is all I see.

00:59.531 --> 01:03.791
Come and rest your bones with me.

01:04.369 --> 01:09.475
Driving slow on Sunday morning, oh I never wanna leave.
