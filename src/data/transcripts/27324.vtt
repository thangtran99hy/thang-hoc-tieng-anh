00:00.635 --> 00:02.851
Monday night's 5.8 magnitude earthquake...

00:02.931 --> 00:06.559
...shook not only the southwestern part of Korea close to the epicenter,...

00:06.955 --> 00:09.433
...but also Seoul and other parts of the country.

00:10.563 --> 00:12.610
The Korea Meteorological Administration...

00:12.672 --> 00:16.274
...said that this quake's actual waveform was very extensive,...

00:16.695 --> 00:18.963
...so much so that it spread throughout the nation.

00:19.867 --> 00:22.720
The strongest earthquake prior to the one on Monday night...

00:22.855 --> 00:26.312
...was a 5.3 magnitude quake that occurred in Euiju,...

00:26.709 --> 00:30.401
...Pyongan-bukdo province, in North Korea in 1980.

00:30.975 --> 00:33.835
The Korean Peninsula has been relatively safe from earthquakes...

00:33.921 --> 00:37.482
...since it is located away from the edge of a tectonic plate.

00:38.149 --> 00:41.089
Nonetheless, experts predict that the country could be hit...

00:41.251 --> 00:44.822
...by an earthquake as strong as 6.5 magnitude.
