00:01.580 --> 00:02.345
I like math.

00:03.472 --> 00:04.509
I like modeling.

00:05.400 --> 00:06.823
I like computers.

00:08.191 --> 00:10.674
But what I wanna do is be able to use it to help people,...

00:10.916 --> 00:14.399
...and so, it's really interesting or kind of exciting...

00:14.480 --> 00:19.465
...that we can use these tools in helping in this humanitarian cause.

00:23.467 --> 00:26.999
Although the food bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina is the largest...

00:27.078 --> 00:29.545
...in the state, they still can't reach everyone.

00:30.635 --> 00:32.643
Enter Dr. Ivy and Dr. Davis.

00:33.805 --> 00:35.567
They're engineers who realized analytics...

00:35.637 --> 00:37.821
...could revolutionize how food banks operate.

00:38.411 --> 00:39.745
They reached out to see how they could help.

00:41.522 --> 00:44.023
The food bank gave us tons of data,...

00:44.631 --> 00:47.166
...and initially, we're like, "Data, data, data,"...

00:47.451 --> 00:49.420
...but data can be a blessing and a curse.

00:51.229 --> 00:52.700
They mined through millions of records...

00:52.778 --> 00:55.071
...and translated the numbers into useful information.

00:56.083 --> 00:58.284
Some of the models that we have developed...

00:58.419 --> 01:01.564
...try to predict the amount of food that might be donated.

01:03.802 --> 01:08.955
The other type of models also try to estimate how many people might be in need of food.

01:09.893 --> 01:14.911
We tried to pull in data about unemployment, poverty,...

01:15.405 --> 01:19.042
...to see if we can get a better estimate of the true need...

01:19.421 --> 01:20.607
...in the counties that they serve.
