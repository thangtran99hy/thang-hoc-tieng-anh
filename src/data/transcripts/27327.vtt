00:01.531 --> 00:03.297
The Peloponnese is incredible.

00:03.375 --> 00:05.649
It's got a huge array of things,...

00:05.730 --> 00:08.085
...everything from ruins to beaches.

00:08.619 --> 00:10.532
It's a place with "Filoxenia,"...

00:10.956 --> 00:13.279
...the traditional Greek welcoming attitude,...

00:13.637 --> 00:17.843
...so it's a wonderful spot to see the whole spectrum of what Greece has to offer.

00:19.350 --> 00:24.186
It is one of those truly forgotten regions of Greece, but also in Europe.

00:24.511 --> 00:27.159
It can really offer anything to anybody.

00:28.065 --> 00:32.775
We have Olympia, which is the site of the original Olympic Games,...

00:32.865 --> 00:36.391
...and you can tour the stadium where the athletes used to compete.
