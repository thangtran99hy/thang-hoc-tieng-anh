ï»¿Chicken Little was a wee little hen...

00:02.301 --> 00:05.300
...who was known around the kingdom for her good advice.

00:05.558 --> 00:08.838
All the animals would come to her with their problems.

00:09.237 --> 00:12.968
Gus van Goose would ask Chicken Little about his stories...

00:13.043 --> 00:14.719
...when he couldn't come up with a good ending.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.480
How about they all lived happily ever after?

00:17.825 --> 00:18.571
Is that good?

00:18.946 --> 00:20.088
Yes, my good goose.

00:20.224 --> 00:21.149
That's a good ending.

00:21.459 --> 00:25.263
Lily Lizardson would ask Chicken Little about sunbathing...

00:25.340 --> 00:27.977
...and proper precautions to avoid sun damage.

00:28.331 --> 00:29.173
This will help.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.014
Oh my gosh, Chicken Little!

00:31.094 --> 00:32.367
Thanks so much.

00:32.674 --> 00:35.551
And Turtle Thompson would ask Chicken Little for help...

00:35.630 --> 00:37.980
...when he couldn't think of a rhyme for his raps.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.486
Change the color of his head to red.

00:40.823 --> 00:42.511
Nothing really rhymes with orange.

00:42.962 --> 00:44.981
Ha ha, that's brilliant!

00:45.268 --> 00:46.371
Thanks Chicken Little.

00:46.695 --> 00:50.199
Chicken Little always had a solution for everything.
