ï»¿Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to witness the union...

00:07.760 --> 00:10.787
...of Mark Woodhouse and Pamela Mullin in holy matrimony.

00:11.329 --> 00:14.141
If anyone can show just cause why they should not be lawfully joined...

00:14.227 --> 00:16.059
...together, let them speak now or...

00:16.117 --> 00:16.556
Wait!

00:18.401 --> 00:18.655
Dad?

00:19.167 --> 00:19.757
What are you doing?

00:21.631 --> 00:22.446
There's a Pikachu here.

00:22.995 --> 00:23.721
Catch it!

00:26.447 --> 00:28.301
No, hey, this is our wedding.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.008
Stop playing Pokemon Go.

00:30.962 --> 00:33.557
I mean seriously, show some respect.

00:34.711 --> 00:35.615
Are you playing too?

00:36.069 --> 00:38.591
Nope, just speed-reading our vows.

00:38.661 --> 00:39.121
Caught it!

00:39.243 --> 00:43.578
I caught, caught our vows in my heart.

00:45.043 --> 00:46.001
I'm sorry, where were we?

00:46.275 --> 00:46.949
You've got to be kidding me.

00:47.514 --> 00:48.863
I have serious FOMO.

00:49.493 --> 00:52.024
Okay, everyone just put your phones away, please.

00:52.107 --> 00:52.811
Let's proceed.

00:53.907 --> 00:56.523
Who gives this woman to be married to this man?

00:57.051 --> 00:57.755
I do.

00:58.423 --> 00:59.409
It's a Mr. Mime!

00:59.507 --> 01:00.270
Catch it!

01:00.925 --> 01:03.292
What? No, I'm not a pokemon, stop trying to catch me.

01:03.405 --> 01:06.470
Wait, no there really is a Mr. Mime here in the game.

01:06.535 --> 01:07.937
Then catch it!

01:09.225 --> 01:09.825
I caught it!

01:10.279 --> 01:10.830
I caught it!

01:11.243 --> 01:12.909
This is the best day of my life!
