Ever since I can remember, I've always looked up to you.

00:12.689 --> 00:15.039
When we were little girls, I thought you were so cool.

00:15.831 --> 00:18.776
I did everything I could to dress and act exactly like you...

00:18.889 --> 00:20.455
...because I wanted to be like you.

00:21.131 --> 00:24.245
Now that I have my own taste in clothes, obviously better taste,...

00:24.795 --> 00:27.487
...I want you to know I still consider you an incredible role model.

00:28.550 --> 00:31.002
You've shown me what being a sister means.

00:31.775 --> 00:34.907
Being a sister means bringing chicken noodle soup when she feels sick.

00:35.948 --> 00:39.765
It means fighting over who gets to ride shotgun and sometimes letting her win.

00:42.357 --> 00:44.556
Being a sister means picking her up from a party...

00:44.637 --> 00:45.887
...when she's had too much to drink.

00:48.251 --> 00:50.751
Being a sister means a lot of different things.

00:51.441 --> 00:54.349
But most importantly, it means you'll always have a best friend.

00:56.102 --> 00:59.421
Thank you for helping me grow from a girl into a woman.

01:01.303 --> 01:01.752
I love you.
