A good night's sleep is important,...

00:03.042 --> 00:05.097
...but life often gets in the way:...

00:05.780 --> 00:07.027
...status updates,...

00:08.543 --> 00:10.059
...nagging thoughts,...

00:11.162 --> 00:12.795
...season three finales.

00:14.559 --> 00:18.919
So finding a natural rhythm, going to bed the same time,...

00:19.088 --> 00:26.406
...and sleeping the right amount can help us think sharper, stay healthier,...

00:27.934 --> 00:29.618
...even fight off a cold.

00:30.805 --> 00:32.566
So let's protect our sleep,...

00:33.820 --> 00:36.247
...not just leave it to the hours left in the day,...

00:36.916 --> 00:41.941
...because every good day really starts with a good night.
