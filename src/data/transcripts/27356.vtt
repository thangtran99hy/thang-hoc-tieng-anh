ï»¿Am I gonna make that deadline?

00:03.734 --> 00:04.889
How bad's the traffic?

00:05.846 --> 00:07.468
What's my password again?

00:08.527 --> 00:09.863
How many likes did I get?

00:10.891 --> 00:14.215
With our busy lives, our minds can get pretty restless.

00:14.381 --> 00:17.613
But our brains aren't wired to be constantly switched on.

00:18.323 --> 00:23.103
So, taking some time to quiet your mind and be in the moment...

00:23.758 --> 00:27.826
...can make you less stressed and improve your health overall.

00:28.991 --> 00:31.109
There are many ways to be mindful,...

00:32.224 --> 00:36.818
...like simply finding a moment to take a few deep breaths.

00:39.571 --> 00:41.033
Feeling better already.
