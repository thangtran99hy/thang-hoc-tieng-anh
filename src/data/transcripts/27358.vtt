ï»¿A strategy that I use to keep me focused on goals is know the numbers.

00:06.378 --> 00:09.729
What I mean by that is this: In business, you can have so many different goals, right?

00:10.317 --> 00:12.227
You have qualitative goals, you have quantitative goals.

00:12.321 --> 00:16.448
You have soft goals and hard goals and it can turn into just a morass of confusion.

00:16.741 --> 00:20.181
But ultimately, numbers, numbers are the language of business.

00:20.463 --> 00:22.443
So, if you wake up as CEO in the middle of the night,...

00:22.528 --> 00:26.187
...he should be able to tell you growth rates and operating margin percentages...

00:26.581 --> 00:29.963
...and EBITDAs and every KPI, key performance indicator.

00:30.211 --> 00:34.212
If you don't know your numbers as a CEO, you might be in trouble.
