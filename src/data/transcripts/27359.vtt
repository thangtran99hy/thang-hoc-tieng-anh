00:00.385 --> 00:03.607
For better or worse, the crown has landed on my head.

00:03.975 --> 00:08.384
She rules an empire at 25, under a crown fit for a king.

00:09.481 --> 00:10.995
She rules from the inside.

00:11.412 --> 00:14.572
I'm president of the TV and you can't do nothing 'bout it.

00:14.669 --> 00:16.028
And they call me crazy.

00:18.509 --> 00:20.335
She rules with her mind,...

00:20.745 --> 00:22.435
...and she rules like this.

00:22.619 --> 00:24.016
I'm the star of the show!

00:24.627 --> 00:25.303
With soul.

00:25.418 --> 00:27.909
How can you be an artist and not reflect the times?

00:28.440 --> 00:29.735
With superpowers.

00:31.185 --> 00:32.945
Respect! Get some.

00:33.062 --> 00:35.641
With a sharp knife and Michelin stars.

00:35.743 --> 00:38.017
We're the strong ones and you can't break us!

00:38.155 --> 00:41.061
We are the optimistic, the fearless.

00:41.193 --> 00:41.847
Mic drop.

00:42.227 --> 00:43.963
Man, where my girls at?

00:44.136 --> 00:47.683
Brave, strong and relentless,...

00:48.281 --> 00:49.653
...long may we reign.

00:52.136 --> 00:53.631
Revolution must come from within.
