ï»¿Once upon a time, that's what we old folks say when we're not sure of the date,...

00:04.483 --> 00:09.019
...but way back when, there was an old man who built puppets.

00:09.409 --> 00:12.720
The kind with strings attached to their arms, and legs, and heads.

00:13.169 --> 00:14.642
It's called "marionettes" actually.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.309
This man was a very lonely old man.

00:17.509 --> 00:21.199
And so, he would build these puppets to keep him company.

00:21.706 --> 00:22.689
Pretty smart, actually.

00:22.953 --> 00:27.712
Well one day, this old man built a puppet so amazing...

00:27.808 --> 00:30.337
...that it actually started to move on its own!

00:30.891 --> 00:31.541
Well, hi!

00:31.884 --> 00:33.375
Are you my papa?

00:34.097 --> 00:35.194
I sure am!

00:35.346 --> 00:37.138
And you are Pinocchio.

00:37.631 --> 00:38.511
Beautiful!

00:38.817 --> 00:41.194
What a lovely way to end a story.
