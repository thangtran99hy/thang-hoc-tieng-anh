00:00.213 --> 00:03.691
Bags, bottles, diapers, razors, cups, forks, sporks, straws.

00:04.048 --> 00:07.852
The waste generated from these single-use non-biodegradable plastic products...

00:07.952 --> 00:10.620
...sticks around in some form for about five hundred years...

00:10.753 --> 00:12.216
...or six human lifespans.

00:12.495 --> 00:13.085
Scary.

00:13.491 --> 00:17.057
The idea of saving the world from this plastapocalypse may seem impossible,...

00:17.455 --> 00:19.957
...kinda like not instagramming a really fun salad.

00:20.278 --> 00:20.819
Oh, that's cute.

00:21.037 --> 00:24.239
But luckily, even one person can make a huge impact.

00:24.593 --> 00:25.756
Just bring your own.

00:25.983 --> 00:27.151
Going to the grocery store?

00:27.253 --> 00:28.615
Bring your own reusable bag.

00:28.789 --> 00:33.745
The average American uses an estimated 314 shopping bags per year.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.668
What if you brought that number down to one...

00:35.819 --> 00:37.729
...by using a single reusable bag?

00:37.998 --> 00:41.526
This would save all those resources, like freshwater and fossil fuels,...

00:41.619 --> 00:43.392
...that go into manufacturing and shipping.

00:43.595 --> 00:45.133
And that means saying bye...

00:45.195 --> 00:47.813
...to all the CO2 that would've gone into our atmosphere.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.213
But since bags are not the only part of this single-use monster, why stop there?

00:52.729 --> 00:57.059
The average American tosses approximately 185 pounds of plastic per year.

00:57.250 --> 01:00.439
Now, imagine if the 318 million people living in the US...

01:00.617 --> 01:02.179
...chose to only use reusables.

01:02.552 --> 01:05.679
Multiply those actions by the billions of people living on Earth,...

01:05.868 --> 01:08.133
...and the recovery of our planet seems possible.
