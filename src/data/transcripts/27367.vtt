ï»¿Jimmy Kimmel hosts the 68th Emmys...

00:03.611 --> 00:07.817
...and took no time to joke about the US Presidential Elections.

00:08.057 --> 00:08.713
Are you nominated?

00:09.269 --> 00:09.780
I am, yeah!

00:10.864 --> 00:11.163
Wow.

00:11.614 --> 00:12.280
What's that like?

00:13.485 --> 00:16.339
And then about the lack of diversity for the Emmys.

00:16.559 --> 00:20.942
Especially if you're a nominee, please find a white person right now, go ahead.

00:21.256 --> 00:22.005
It shouldn't be hard.

00:22.323 --> 00:23.590
I see a bunch of them right here.

00:24.253 --> 00:28.248
Just take a moment to reach out and say, "Thanks for your bravery."

00:29.467 --> 00:31.806
This made the win for Master of None,...

00:32.075 --> 00:37.811
...a show that centers around an Indian-American actor, for Best Comedy Series Writing...

00:38.051 --> 00:39.663
...so much more meaningful.

00:40.097 --> 00:42.715
Asian parents out there, if you could just do me a favor,...

00:42.819 --> 00:46.431
...just a couple of you, get your kids cameras instead of violins,...

00:46.507 --> 00:47.216
...we'll be all good.

00:47.505 --> 00:48.252
So, let's do it!

00:48.749 --> 00:51.546
Game of Thrones and Veep took home the big awards...

00:51.667 --> 00:54.243
...for Best Drama and Best Comedy Series.

00:54.483 --> 00:59.179
Game of Thrones broke the record for the total wins for any scripted series.

00:59.549 --> 01:03.904
One of the biggest surprises of the evening, Rami Malek from Mr. Robot...

01:04.016 --> 01:07.481
...beat out Kevin Spacey and Liev Schreiber for Best Actor.

01:10.233 --> 01:11.910
Please tell me you're seeing this too.

01:13.741 --> 01:18.493
It was also Tatiana Maslany's first-time win for Best Actress...

01:18.593 --> 01:20.326
...in her role in Orphan Black.

01:20.633 --> 01:25.089
I feel so lucky to be on a show that puts women at the center.

01:25.526 --> 01:28.375
And thank you so much to the Academy.

01:28.512 --> 01:28.877
Thank you.
