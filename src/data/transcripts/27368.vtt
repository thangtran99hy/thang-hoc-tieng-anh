To me, the largest area of work for the future:...

00:04.829 --> 00:09.388
...energy and water are the real solutions to health, livelihood,...

00:10.069 --> 00:11.429
...all of the stuff that goes above it.

00:12.199 --> 00:15.931
Most people don't realize, but half the world either has no electricity...

00:16.124 --> 00:17.540
...or electricity two, three hours a day.

00:18.994 --> 00:20.225
Everything requires energy.

00:21.109 --> 00:22.623
Energy is the great equalizer.

00:23.900 --> 00:29.171
So you try to look for that, which is the one thing that will lead to benefits...

00:29.284 --> 00:31.449
...that are across hundreds of things.

00:32.473 --> 00:34.873
Human mechanical energy is so amazing.

00:35.254 --> 00:37.571
Why can't we use that to create energy?

00:38.758 --> 00:42.727
So, we've invented a hybrid bicycle that you pedal for an hour,...

00:43.458 --> 00:45.360
...and you have electricity for 24 hours.

00:46.021 --> 00:47.557
We call it Free Electric.

00:48.467 --> 00:51.917
The Free Electric, I think, is the coolest of all our inventions...

00:52.259 --> 00:53.466
...and yet it's going to affect,...

00:53.853 --> 00:57.067
...maybe have the largest effect of anything in the last hundred years.
