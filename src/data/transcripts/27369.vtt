There are a lot of ways that this marvelous language of ours, English, doesn't make sense.

00:05.096 --> 00:08.773
For example, most of the time, when we talk about more than one of something,...

00:08.865 --> 00:10.191
...we put an "s" on the end.

00:10.431 --> 00:12.331
One cat, two cats.

00:13.033 --> 00:15.891
But then, there's that handful of words where things work differently.

00:16.283 --> 00:19.413
Alone, you have a man; If he has company, then you've got men,...

00:19.771 --> 00:22.031
...or probably better for him, women too.

00:22.293 --> 00:25.222
Although, if there were only one of them, it would be a woman.

00:25.861 --> 00:28.735
Or if there's more than one goose, they're geese,...

00:28.961 --> 00:31.337
...but why aren't lots of "mooses" "meese"?

00:31.573 --> 00:36.631
Or if you have two feet, then why don't you read two "beek" instead of books?

00:37.289 --> 00:41.155
The fact is that if you were speaking English before about a thousand years ago,...

00:41.707 --> 00:45.149
..."beek" is exactly what you would have said for more than one book.

00:45.783 --> 00:48.947
If modern English is strange, Old English needed therapy.

00:49.333 --> 00:53.927
Believe it or not, English used to be an even harder language to learn than it is today.
