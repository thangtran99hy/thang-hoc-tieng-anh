ï»¿I think that I would describe peace as,...

00:08.019 --> 00:11.179
...not just the lack of violence or lack of conflict.

00:11.309 --> 00:14.392
If everybody in the world can find peace within themselves.

00:14.587 --> 00:18.299
The other part of peace, the positive description of peace, is actually...

00:18.827 --> 00:20.526
...when we strive towards a world...

00:20.685 --> 00:24.506
...in which every person is enabled to be their best version at all times.

00:24.745 --> 00:27.000
Freedom of being who you are,...

00:27.323 --> 00:29.512
...freedom of saying what you want...

00:29.601 --> 00:32.228
...and not feeling that you're gonna be discriminated upon.

00:32.397 --> 00:36.087
And every person's planet can live to their fullest potential...

00:36.900 --> 00:38.492
...before limiting anybody else.
