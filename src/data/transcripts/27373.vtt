When you're with him, do you call his name...

00:05.213 --> 00:09.977
...like you do when you're with me, does it feel the same?

00:10.499 --> 00:15.481
Would you leave if I was ready to settle down...

00:16.155 --> 00:21.737
...or would you play it safe and stay?

00:22.139 --> 00:30.912
Girl, I know this, we got a love that is hopeless.

00:32.119 --> 00:35.921
Why can't you hold me in the street?

00:36.325 --> 00:40.386
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?

00:42.105 --> 00:45.051
I wish that it could be like that.

00:45.387 --> 00:47.596
Why can't it be like that?

00:48.011 --> 00:52.434
'Cause I'm yours.

00:53.087 --> 00:57.214
And nobody knows I'm in love with someone's baby.

00:57.411 --> 00:59.390
I don't wanna hide us away.

00:59.505 --> 01:02.059
Tell the world about the love we're making.

01:02.149 --> 01:05.027
I'm living for that day,...

01:05.833 --> 01:09.807
...someday.
