On Tuesday, November 8th, this country will make one of the most important,...

00:04.082 --> 00:05.316
...the most important,...

00:05.419 --> 00:07.363
...the most important decisions in its history.

00:07.874 --> 00:09.320
You have a chance,...

00:09.392 --> 00:11.069

00:11.395 --> 00:12.997
...to be a part of that decision.

00:13.335 --> 00:14.588
You might think it's not important.

00:14.704 --> 00:16.502
You might think you're not important.

00:16.791 --> 00:17.424
But that's not true.

00:18.103 --> 00:20.968
And the only way we can prove that to you is by having lots of famous people...

00:21.026 --> 00:22.646
...repeating how important...

00:22.785 --> 00:23.073

...for our communities,...

00:38.993 --> 00:39.841
...for America.

00:42.322 --> 00:44.513
All it takes is all of us.

00:44.813 --> 00:45.291
All of us.

00:46.425 --> 00:50.162
We can not pretend both sides are equally unfavorable.

00:50.309 --> 00:51.995
We can't say one vote doesn't matter.

00:52.166 --> 00:52.943
Your vote matters.

00:54.058 --> 00:54.994
It affects everything.

00:55.148 --> 00:56.232
Not just the presidency...

00:56.305 --> 00:56.999
...but the Senate,...

00:57.071 --> 00:57.593
...the House,...

00:57.650 --> 00:59.012
...your local officials,...

00:59.069 --> 00:59.748
...immigration,...

01:00.218 --> 01:00.608

01:05.799 --> 01:08.693
See, this isn't just an election, it's a tipping point...

01:08.931 --> 01:09.435
...for the country,...

01:09.703 --> 01:10.403
...for the world,...

01:10.739 --> 01:11.267
...for your world.

01:11.793 --> 01:13.363
