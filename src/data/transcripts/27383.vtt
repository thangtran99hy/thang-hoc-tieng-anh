When I was a kid, I always wanted to be a marine biologist,...

00:04.145 --> 00:06.522
...and I was the person that would always be spouting off random facts...

00:06.583 --> 00:08.771
...like, "Did you know a blue whale can be 110 feet long,"...

00:09.193 --> 00:10.307
...just to people I didn't even know.

00:10.674 --> 00:12.958
And I always felt that there's something that we can learn from them.

00:13.179 --> 00:14.693
What really attracted me to the program...

00:14.859 --> 00:17.838
...was the idea that I would be able to still do science.

00:18.105 --> 00:20.585
My role is a volunteer citizen scientist.

00:20.687 --> 00:24.446
What I do is I fly my drones in the beaches on the California coast...

00:24.576 --> 00:27.015
...to help map and determine the effects of El Nino.

00:28.238 --> 00:31.957
This year, California is experiencing a sort of unprecedented El Nino event.

00:32.525 --> 00:33.859
We've got very extreme weather...

00:33.928 --> 00:36.207
...and given how strong it is gives us a sort of crystal ball...

00:36.328 --> 00:39.168
...about what sea level rise and what climate change is gonna look like...

00:39.267 --> 00:40.830
...in the future along the California coast.

00:41.100 --> 00:44.932
Using phones or drones, UAVs, to document that change...

00:44.993 --> 00:45.914
...would be a good way to do that.

00:46.305 --> 00:48.413
So, we've asked people to take photos of events,...

00:48.511 --> 00:51.055
...where there's been real high water along the coast...

00:51.184 --> 00:54.785
...or water that's been overtopping dunes or inundating coastal areas.

00:54.916 --> 00:56.934
Another big reason that I really wanted to be involved...

00:57.031 --> 00:59.174
...was that there's a lot of publicity about drones,...

00:59.247 --> 01:00.881
...and a lot of it isn't necessarily good.

01:01.399 --> 01:03.519
There's a lot that drones can do that are good for the community...

01:03.584 --> 01:06.226
...and for the world, and it's just getting the word out there.
