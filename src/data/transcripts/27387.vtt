00:00.547 --> 00:02.178
And finally, there's the "ask me later."

00:02.665 --> 00:05.687
Our jobs tend to coax us into believing that opportunities come and go.

00:05.900 --> 00:07.184
They're here until they're not.

00:07.646 --> 00:09.392
But they may be more flexible than they seem...

00:09.482 --> 00:12.975
...and sometimes you can swap the job opportunity you aren't ready to pursue now...

00:13.361 --> 00:16.477
...for a relationship with a hiring manager that you can tap into later on.

00:16.915 --> 00:19.063
So, in these situations, the same principle applies.

00:19.265 --> 00:20.007
Focus on the fit.

00:20.507 --> 00:22.999
It isn't right for me now for x, y and z reasons...
