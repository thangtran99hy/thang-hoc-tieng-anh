Why should over 200 years of Citi history matter to you?

00:05.363 --> 00:08.399
Well, because it tells us something powerful about progress:...

00:09.058 --> 00:10.793
...that whether times are good or bad,...

00:11.530 --> 00:14.573
...people and their ideas will continue to move the world forward...

00:15.076 --> 00:17.181
...as long as they have someone to believe in them.

00:18.333 --> 00:21.730
Citi financed the Transatlantic Cable that connected continents,...

00:22.297 --> 00:25.606
...and the Panama Canal that made our world a smaller place.

00:27.413 --> 00:30.531
We backed the Marshall Plan that helped Europe regain its strength,...

00:32.336 --> 00:35.213
...and pioneered the ATM for cash anytime.

00:38.337 --> 00:41.197
For over two centuries, we've supported dreams like these,...

00:41.641 --> 00:43.661
...and the people and companies behind them.

00:45.185 --> 00:46.540
So, why should that matter to you?

00:47.764 --> 00:52.253
Because today, we are still helping progress makers turn their ideas into reality.

00:53.438 --> 00:56.617
And the next great idea could be yours.
