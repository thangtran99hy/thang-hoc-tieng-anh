Every Facebook feed has that couple:...

00:02.657 --> 00:05.674
...the ones always posting mushy gushy status updates...

00:05.991 --> 00:08.945
...and googly-eyed pictures from romantic vacations.

00:09.316 --> 00:12.857
It turns out there could be a scientific reason for all that oversharing.

00:13.303 --> 00:16.255
It's called relationship-contingent self-esteem,...

00:16.708 --> 00:20.559
...an unhealthy kind of self-esteem that comes from romantic relationships.

00:20.726 --> 00:23.617
It's been linked for a long time to lower overall self-esteem...

00:24.046 --> 00:25.613
...and higher social anxiety.

00:25.999 --> 00:28.651
But new research shows that people with RCSE...

00:28.743 --> 00:30.723
...are also more likely to use social media...

00:30.812 --> 00:33.703
...to publicize how amazing their relationships are.

00:34.085 --> 00:35.862
It's also more common among introverts,...

00:36.125 --> 00:40.069
...who may be less apt to share the details of their happiness with pals offline.

00:40.237 --> 00:43.059
While RCSE is considered a negative thing,...

00:43.303 --> 00:46.968
...these posts don't necessarily mean the couple is overcompensating.

00:47.207 --> 00:52.605
In fact, according to researchers, many of these couples really may be just that happy.

00:52.835 --> 00:55.076
