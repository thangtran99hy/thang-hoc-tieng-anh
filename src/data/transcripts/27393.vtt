"Isla Mujeres" means the "island of women."

00:02.920 --> 00:06.555
In Mayan times, this was a sanctuary devoted to the goddess of the moon,...

00:06.711 --> 00:09.415
...fertility, healing and the feminine forces of nature.

00:09.907 --> 00:12.404
And it's just a quick half-hour ferry ride from Cancun.

00:14.701 --> 00:16.765
Once here, you can take in the whole island...

00:17.003 --> 00:18.428
...from behind the wheel of a golf cart.

00:19.511 --> 00:22.287
Just a little further up the coast is Garrafon de Castilla.

00:22.689 --> 00:26.615
This natural reef is known for its incredible beauty and roster of fun.

00:29.773 --> 00:31.836
The zip line here is awesome.

00:33.255 --> 00:36.438
The turquoise color below me is so stunning, it looks like a special effect.
