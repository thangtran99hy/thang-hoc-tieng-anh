ï»¿That's what you're gonna ask her too?

00:06.767 --> 00:07.541
That's a hard question.

00:10.997 --> 00:12.437
Well, without teachers,...

00:14.019 --> 00:15.903
What would the world be like without teachers?

00:18.162 --> 00:18.773
Chaos.

00:19.397 --> 00:19.981
Sad.

00:20.733 --> 00:22.243
Because I won't learn anything.

00:23.117 --> 00:26.603
The younger generation wouldn't have anyone to look up to, to learn from.

00:26.934 --> 00:28.555
Walk around ignorant.

00:29.003 --> 00:31.337
I mean, we can keep the teachers but just no homework.

00:32.121 --> 00:32.742
That'd be pretty cool.

00:33.879 --> 00:37.299
Everybody would be going cuckoo and we wouldn't know anything.

00:37.525 --> 00:40.972
I don't know, that's the scariest thought that anyone could ever have.

00:41.526 --> 00:45.563
I think it will be craziness just because I feel like teachers are, besides our parents,...

00:45.662 --> 00:49.226
...the first people we meet who shape who we become.
