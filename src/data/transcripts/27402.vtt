ï»¿This is my friend Laura, and she's 80 years old.

00:03.289 --> 00:08.101
And this is my friend Tiffany, and she is 26.

00:08.741 --> 00:10.535
And we live in a retirement community.

00:17.964 --> 00:20.945
I'm a part of the artist in residence program at Judson Manor,...

00:21.270 --> 00:26.319
...which is a residential program where young musicians get to live here rent-free...

00:26.605 --> 00:30.041
...in exchange for performing recitals and concerts.

00:30.754 --> 00:35.431
When I tell people I live in a retirement community, I get a lot of mixed reactions.

00:35.551 --> 00:40.607
Some people don't believe me, other people think it's a wonderful idea.

00:42.137 --> 00:48.012
I had not been a part of this community more than two days.

00:48.835 --> 00:51.818
I was in the lobby and they told me about Tiffany,...

00:51.893 --> 00:56.476
...and I walked over and introduced myself, and I said, "Do you like dogs?"

00:57.441 --> 00:58.935
Oh, she loves dogs.

00:59.709 --> 01:01.891
And Tiffany and I became friends.

01:02.239 --> 01:03.818
We just formed a friendship.
