Bavaria is a place of superlatives.

00:06.912 --> 00:09.942
It's home to Germany's highest mountain, the Zugspitze,...

00:11.001 --> 00:13.633
...and Bayern Munich, the country's top soccer club.

00:16.262 --> 00:18.464
Kings once built beautiful castles here.

00:20.459 --> 00:23.174
Today, big German brands are headquartered here.

00:26.089 --> 00:30.757
And Bavaria is also home to what may be the world's most famous beer festival:...

00:31.125 --> 00:32.001
...Oktoberfest.

00:33.752 --> 00:37.677
So, it's no wonder that Bavaria is also Germany's top travel destination.
