00:00.203 --> 00:03.211
There're four people and two on each team.

00:03.335 --> 00:06.407
You have to get the letter L and O...

00:06.635 --> 00:09.104
There's skipping, swimming, running...

00:09.159 --> 00:10.891
...and one art picture.

00:10.951 --> 00:15.178
You need to wear protective gloves and a helmet.

00:15.297 --> 00:17.233
First, they get up in a line.

00:17.362 --> 00:21.122
Start off with a ball, and they throw it behind them.

00:21.458 --> 00:24.235
You have to look at the ball the whole time...

00:24.299 --> 00:27.542
...cause you don't know if it's going to turn into a Frisbee, a football,...

00:28.239 --> 00:31.369
...a horseshoe, you don't know what it's going to turn into.

00:32.730 --> 00:33.799
You have a penalty!

00:34.173 --> 00:34.579
For what?

00:34.955 --> 00:36.482
Throw it to their partner.

00:36.621 --> 00:39.855
It would change and then you'll have to catch it.

00:40.245 --> 00:41.917
I like the red team.

00:42.440 --> 00:43.751
I like the blue team.

00:43.873 --> 00:47.713
When it's in the middle, you have to get your tennis thingy.

00:48.033 --> 00:50.142
You have to go all the way round.

00:50.379 --> 00:51.550
Don't let people...

00:51.605 --> 00:53.121
I didn't do anything!

00:53.238 --> 00:56.947
And they throw it to their partner but their partner just sits down.

00:57.919 --> 01:02.207
If anyone says stop, then the person who has the ball will have to put it...

01:02.355 --> 01:04.696
...with the tennis thingy without using their hands.

01:04.823 --> 01:09.229
You have to catch it and if you don't catch it, you have to go in the jail.

01:10.125 --> 01:11.818
He grabs it and scores.

01:14.283 --> 01:17.531
And if he doesn't score, he's kicked out of the team.

01:18.805 --> 01:23.284
And once you get a point you get to say, "I got a rainbow!"
