ï»¿This is a personal gift from the United States government...

00:04.668 --> 00:06.599
...designed to bring death to the enemy.

00:07.676 --> 00:09.572
I'm sorry, Sergeant, I can't touch a gun.

00:10.535 --> 00:11.188
You don't kill?

00:11.784 --> 00:12.128
No, sir.

00:12.398 --> 00:14.323
You know quite a bit of killing does occur in war?

00:15.556 --> 00:17.439
Private Doss does not believe in violence.

00:18.207 --> 00:20.773
Do not look to him to save you on the battlefield.

00:22.315 --> 00:23.917
I don't think this is a question of religion.

00:24.123 --> 00:25.209
I think this is cowardice.

00:28.778 --> 00:29.774
There's something you gotta see.

00:31.807 --> 00:32.406
Who did this?

00:32.848 --> 00:33.853
Doss the coward.

00:36.485 --> 00:39.453
Please, Lord, help me get one more.

00:42.734 --> 00:43.751
Help me get one more.
