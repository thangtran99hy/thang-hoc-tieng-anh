Sometimes I separate some of my food to make it look like I ate more of what I didn't eat.

00:07.371 --> 00:08.394
I want what I want.

00:08.563 --> 00:10.181
I don't like beans.

00:10.295 --> 00:12.063
I don't really like mushy things.

00:13.889 --> 00:15.311
Oh, I don't like potatoes.

00:15.525 --> 00:16.963
I don't like potatoes either.

00:17.324 --> 00:19.079
It's just the flavor.

00:19.189 --> 00:20.007
I hate it.

00:21.250 --> 00:25.210
What I think is healthy is fruit.

00:25.466 --> 00:26.010
Fruit.

00:26.384 --> 00:32.251
It has vitamin C that makes you strong and you can dance.

00:33.059 --> 00:35.246
How you can get strong is take a nap.

00:35.859 --> 00:37.116
I love mushrooms.

00:37.230 --> 00:38.173
Me too.

00:38.309 --> 00:40.921
That flavor really pops out to me.

00:41.537 --> 00:46.508
Yeah, I like it but it makes me throw up in my mouth a little.

00:46.645 --> 00:49.007
What mom cooks which I like is...

00:49.121 --> 00:49.861
...brussels sprouts.

00:49.962 --> 00:51.675
Yeah, I like brussels sprouts.

00:52.018 --> 00:54.569
It tastes like burned salad.
