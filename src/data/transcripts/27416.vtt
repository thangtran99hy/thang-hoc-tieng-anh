Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago,...

00:05.385 --> 00:08.179
...I was in your sights, you got me alone.

00:08.406 --> 00:12.567
You found me, you found me, you found me.

00:14.244 --> 00:17.206
And I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that.

00:17.435 --> 00:20.393
And when I fell hard, you took a step back...

00:20.650 --> 00:24.795
...without me, without me, without me.

00:27.683 --> 00:33.721
He was long gone when he's next to me...

00:33.849 --> 00:38.722
...and I realized the blame was on me.

00:38.941 --> 00:43.231
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in,...

00:43.415 --> 00:45.441
...so shame on me now.

00:45.581 --> 00:48.999
Flew me to places I've never been...

00:49.138 --> 00:51.185
...'til you put me down, oh.

00:51.322 --> 00:55.295
I knew you were trouble when you walked in,...

00:55.457 --> 00:57.688
...so shame on me now.

00:57.834 --> 01:01.241
Flew me to places I've never been,...

01:01.478 --> 01:03.977
...and now I'm lying on the cold, hard ground.

01:04.244 --> 01:10.004
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble.
