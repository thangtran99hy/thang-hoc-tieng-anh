Research shows that study sessions are most effective in small, short chunks.

00:04.883 --> 00:07.240
Instead of cramming in a ten-hour study session,...

00:07.482 --> 00:09.199
...it's much more effective to spread it out...

00:09.303 --> 00:12.181
...into 20, 30-minute sessions over a few weeks.

00:12.603 --> 00:16.032
This is because your brain is better at encoding information into the synapses...

00:16.095 --> 00:19.237
...in short, repeated sessions as opposed to one large one.

00:19.677 --> 00:22.892
And this is why even learning different skills, whether it's swimming,...

00:22.989 --> 00:26.425
...tennis or a singing lesson, often follows the same format.

00:26.538 --> 00:28.386
Practice, practice, practice!

00:28.679 --> 00:31.203
Not only do practice tests put your brains in the environment,...

00:31.550 --> 00:34.746
...but even if you make mistakes, they help identify gaps in your knowledge.

00:35.249 --> 00:37.665
Practice tests have also been shown to increase confidence,...

00:37.959 --> 00:39.588
...thereby leading to better performance.
