When I met her, I knew with certainty...

00:03.357 --> 00:05.394
...that I wanted to travel the world with her forever.

00:06.901 --> 00:08.105
That hasn't changed.

00:09.097 --> 00:11.153
My hair, however, certainly has.

00:12.375 --> 00:14.035
We climbed Kilimanjaro together.

00:14.999 --> 00:17.553
We purchased tickets on a whim and moved to Korea.

00:18.341 --> 00:23.059
We bought a secondhand motorcycle together and we traveled.

00:24.589 --> 00:26.662
I remember watching her eyes light up...

00:27.009 --> 00:28.723
...when we trained falcons in Bahrain...

00:28.821 --> 00:31.117
...or explored the hidden corners of the globe,..

00:31.221 --> 00:33.069
....and that was everything to me.

00:34.367 --> 00:38.958
With each new trip, we found out more about the world and each other.

00:40.898 --> 00:42.973
When I proposed at the Taj Mahal,...

00:44.089 --> 00:48.475
...did so because all I wanted was to travel the world with her forever.

00:50.762 --> 00:54.091
Ours was a love story written in arrival and departure dates.

00:54.776 --> 00:58.567
Love notes signed to seat assignments 4A and 4B.

01:00.513 --> 01:03.769
You learn so much in traveling with someone,...

01:05.083 --> 01:07.039
...not only about them, but about yourself.

01:08.541 --> 01:12.208
Each new adventure lets our love for one another and the world grow...

01:14.317 --> 01:17.152
...and I didn't think we could ever find a journey more exciting than that.
