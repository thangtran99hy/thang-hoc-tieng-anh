Let's learn when to use the comparative adjective "fewer."

00:05.731 --> 00:06.335
Your Grace.

00:12.667 --> 00:14.014
Do your knuckle bones bring you luck?

00:17.799 --> 00:19.994
Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace.

00:21.103 --> 00:22.751
And it's four less fingernails to clean.

00:23.231 --> 00:23.705
Fewer.

00:24.656 --> 00:25.111
Pardon.

00:26.783 --> 00:28.457
Four fewer fingernails to clean.

00:28.584 --> 00:29.367
Let them die.

00:29.888 --> 00:31.030
We got our own to worry about.

00:31.771 --> 00:32.930
Less enemies for us.

00:34.986 --> 00:35.482
Fewer.

00:36.557 --> 00:36.837
What?

00:37.975 --> 00:38.298
Nothing.
