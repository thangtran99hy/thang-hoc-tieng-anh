Our teachers taught us many things, sometimes without us even realizing it,...

00:05.147 --> 00:06.953
...like when they sent us to the corner.

00:07.693 --> 00:09.393
We only saw it as a punishment...

00:09.653 --> 00:11.584
...but we actually learned many things there.

00:12.010 --> 00:13.707
We didn't learn the capitals of Europe...

00:14.033 --> 00:18.397
...but we learned that if something isn't ours, it belongs to someone else.

00:18.935 --> 00:21.352
We didn't learn to speak languages in that corner...

00:21.560 --> 00:25.110
...but we learned the importance of listening in any language.

00:25.884 --> 00:29.115
Teachers send children there to come back as people.

00:30.805 --> 00:33.217
And so teachers, we want to thank you.

00:33.583 --> 00:36.603
And we also want you to know that we still go to that corner.

00:37.095 --> 00:38.690
In fact, now we love to go.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.939
Although it's true that the corner isn't the same anymore,...

00:42.112 --> 00:46.266
...and sometimes it doesn't even look like a corner, we each have our own.

00:46.474 --> 00:50.758
And every time we need to think, gather strength or make an important decision,...

00:50.903 --> 00:53.738
...we send ourselves to our special corner.
