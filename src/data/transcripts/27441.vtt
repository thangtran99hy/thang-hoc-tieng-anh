Dear kitten,...

00:02.363 --> 00:05.223
...I see you've noticed the new addition to our home.

00:05.543 --> 00:07.290
No, you're not crazy.

00:07.553 --> 00:10.909
It is calling to you and it does want you to destroy it.

00:11.219 --> 00:13.862
Don't be timid, I know what you're thinking.

00:14.061 --> 00:16.935
This must be some sort of a trap the humans have set for us.

00:17.039 --> 00:19.329
But they actually encourage us to scratch these.

00:19.527 --> 00:20.339
That's crazy.

00:21.041 --> 00:24.645
I remember the first time I encountered the vertical carpet.

00:24.861 --> 00:26.683
Of course, they were much bigger back then,...

00:26.852 --> 00:30.235
...enormous pillars reaching endlessly into the sky.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.609
Without any sort of guidance or training,...

00:32.765 --> 00:35.130
...I began climbing the first of the towers.

00:35.522 --> 00:38.081
Though exhausted, I reached deep down inside...

00:38.316 --> 00:41.726
...and found the power to ascend the third tower.

00:41.921 --> 00:43.697
And when I arrived at the summit,...

00:43.840 --> 00:48.305
...there was a ceremony held in which the collar of courage was bestowed on me...

00:48.377 --> 00:51.163
...for my valor in the face of extreme danger.

00:52.468 --> 00:53.780
Those were the good old days.
