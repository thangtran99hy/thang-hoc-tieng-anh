My name is Anet Brea de Cortez.

00:06.231 --> 00:07.195
I am from Panama...

00:07.945 --> 00:11.249
...and I come here as a participant of the TEA program...

00:11.624 --> 00:15.961
...given to us by the State Department of United States of America.

00:16.361 --> 00:20.306
It is coordinated also with George Mason University at Fairfax, Virginia.

00:20.447 --> 00:24.215
We are learning a lot of current trends of education...

00:24.572 --> 00:29.243
...and also we are having some field experience at Holmes Middle School.

00:29.627 --> 00:31.613
I know very little of the world.

00:32.153 --> 00:35.901
I don't get outside of the United States very often,...

00:36.687 --> 00:40.939
...and so this is almost a modern form of travel for me...

00:41.437 --> 00:44.467
...because my students and I learn together...

00:44.670 --> 00:48.809
...and so my students see me model learning, as well as teaching.

00:48.935 --> 00:53.230
And the fellows who come here are highly qualified...

00:53.333 --> 00:56.401
...and my students sense that almost immediately.

00:56.786 --> 01:01.672
And I also have asked to go and observe all their classes...

01:02.134 --> 01:04.047
...because I am so interested in assessment.

01:04.259 --> 01:08.555
I have shared with her many of the rubrics that we use.

01:08.961 --> 01:14.709
She tells me that she plans to put those into use in her country.
