00:04.110 --> 00:05.078
ï»¿Good morning, Rosita.

00:05.823 --> 00:07.119
I see that you're having lunch.

00:09.839 --> 00:11.075
Yeah, yeah, I'll wait.

00:15.124 --> 00:15.935
Did you finish?

00:17.958 --> 00:19.215
Do you know what day it is?

00:24.058 --> 00:25.018
Well done!

00:25.602 --> 00:27.829
And do you know why we are celebrating?

00:31.939 --> 00:35.284
Well, Rosita, it's true that food and nutrition are important...

00:35.573 --> 00:37.405
...but there is something else you should know.

00:38.269 --> 00:41.675
Our continent is one of the richest regions on the planet.

00:41.967 --> 00:46.668
Every year, millions of tons of wheat, corn, fruits, vegetables...

00:46.808 --> 00:49.883
...and all kinds of meats and dairy products are produced.

00:50.579 --> 00:54.747
This food is enough and even surpasses our nutritional needs...

00:54.891 --> 00:59.201
...for every man, woman and child that lives in Latin America and the Caribbean.

01:00.549 --> 01:04.617
And it is even enough to help feed many other countries.

01:08.788 --> 01:11.063
Even though we have all these foods,...

01:11.257 --> 01:12.667
...there are still millions of people...

01:12.822 --> 01:15.867
...who daily wake up and go to sleep at night hungry.

01:18.689 --> 01:21.452
There are many reasons that hunger exists.

01:21.775 --> 01:24.107
But the most important one is that there are people...

01:24.202 --> 01:26.947
...who do not have enough money to buy some.

01:28.519 --> 01:29.974
But there's also the waste.

01:30.329 --> 01:32.971
With all the food we throw away in the trash daily...

01:33.335 --> 01:36.014
...we can feed all the people who are suffering from hunger.

01:45.595 --> 01:48.219
Rosita, can I take your tray?

01:54.135 --> 01:55.394
Very good, Rosita!

01:55.673 --> 01:56.763
That's the attitude.
