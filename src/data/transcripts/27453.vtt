ï»¿How long were you on the train?

00:02.862 --> 00:03.410
A couple of days.

00:04.169 --> 00:04.727
A couple of days?

00:09.455 --> 00:12.272
It would take a lifetime to search all the stations in India.

00:18.536 --> 00:20.475
Do you have any idea what it's like?

00:21.169 --> 00:23.601
How every day my real brother screams my name?

00:27.391 --> 00:30.316
I always thought that I could keep this family together.

00:31.663 --> 00:32.746
I need you, Saroo.

00:33.830 --> 00:36.101
What if you do find home and they're not even there...

00:36.846 --> 00:37.795
...and you just keep searching?

00:40.096 --> 00:40.969
I don't have a choice.

00:43.881 --> 00:44.586
What was she like?

00:45.543 --> 00:46.009
Beautiful.
