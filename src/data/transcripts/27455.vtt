00:01.053 --> 00:02.770
Not for the faint-hearted.

00:03.140 --> 00:05.553
A glass bridge has been erected in China...

00:06.089 --> 00:08.487
...and people are already taking a crack at it.

00:09.152 --> 00:12.061
Brave volunteers and staff thrashed sledgehammers down...

00:12.129 --> 00:14.469
...onto the glass-bottom bridge beneath them...

00:14.814 --> 00:17.723
...to test the strength and sturdiness of the structure.

00:19.685 --> 00:23.395
And with the bridge being suspended a whopping 300 meters above ground,...

00:23.621 --> 00:25.330
...that definitely took some guts.

00:25.621 --> 00:29.260
Israeli Haim Dotan is the chief architect behind the project,...

00:29.427 --> 00:33.762
...which its creators claim is the largest glass bridge of its kind in the world.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.517
The courageous volunteers were harnessed...

00:35.595 --> 00:37.592
...to the side of the bridge as a precaution.

00:37.823 --> 00:40.921
But reassuringly, none of them managed to break through the glass.

00:41.793 --> 00:45.154
And just to drive the point home, a 15-ton SUV...

00:45.212 --> 00:49.910
...was then driven over the glass just to hammer in its strength.
