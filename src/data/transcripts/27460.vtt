ï»¿You work at GE?

00:04.476 --> 00:05.052
Oh yeah, I do.

00:05.192 --> 00:07.497
You guys are working on some pretty big stuff over there, right?

00:07.643 --> 00:10.431
Like a new language for crazy, big, world-changing machines.

00:10.489 --> 00:13.003
Well, not me specifically. I work on the industrial side,...

00:13.121 --> 00:15.071
...so I build the world-changing machines.

00:15.961 --> 00:18.582
I get it, you can't talk because it's super high level.

00:19.489 --> 00:21.503
No, I actually do build the machines.

00:21.685 --> 00:24.055
Blink if what you're doing involves event stream processing.

00:26.247 --> 00:27.455
Please know I'm trying not to blink.

00:27.642 --> 00:29.269
Shift uncomfortably if I get warmer.

00:30.487 --> 00:31.827
Encrypted data transfer.

00:33.156 --> 00:34.711
Complex event processing.

00:36.266 --> 00:37.727
Fleet file configuration.

00:40.005 --> 00:42.067
This is my stop, so I'm gonna go.

00:46.238 --> 00:47.588
You guys are in deep.
