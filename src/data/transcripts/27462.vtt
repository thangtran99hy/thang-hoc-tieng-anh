If you like hiking, biking and other outdoor activities,...

00:05.199 --> 00:06.684
...you're gonna love Cappadocia.

00:06.943 --> 00:10.323
There are so many trails surrounded by vineyards and gorgeous scenery.

00:19.125 --> 00:22.320
Of course, the best way to admire the magic of Cappadocia...

00:22.415 --> 00:23.563
...is by hot air balloon.

00:24.029 --> 00:27.063
From 1,000 feet, it looks more like Mars than Earth.

00:28.818 --> 00:31.570
Finally, don't miss the underground cities.

00:31.688 --> 00:34.610
Some of them go 18 floors underground.

00:34.794 --> 00:37.716
The feeling in here is magical and bewildering.

00:37.912 --> 00:42.628
There are tunnels, churches and enough room for 30,000 people.
