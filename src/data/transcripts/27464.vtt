It may look like we're taking a relaxing summer stroll,...

00:02.707 --> 00:04.654
...but actually, we're getting down to business.

00:04.755 --> 00:07.262
I'm here with Wall Street Journal reporter Rachel Bachman...

00:07.357 --> 00:11.146
...to discuss the benefits of the walking work meeting.

00:11.612 --> 00:15.649
Rachel, we've known for a while that people have enjoyed taking it outside.

00:15.831 --> 00:18.994
But now there's new research showing that there are more benefits...

00:19.067 --> 00:20.374
...than we previously understood.

00:20.514 --> 00:21.228
Yes, that's right.

00:21.306 --> 00:24.415
Some people feel like they actually have better ideas and more ideas...

00:24.495 --> 00:26.520
...when they're walking than when they're sitting down.

00:26.601 --> 00:27.986
And the research actually backs this up.

00:28.065 --> 00:28.866
Sounds like a great idea.

00:28.941 --> 00:30.886
So let's get down to the basics,..

00:30.969 --> 00:32.631
...the tips of taking a walk.

00:32.983 --> 00:36.648
What is the optimal number of people for a walking work meeting?

00:36.919 --> 00:38.015
Well Tanya, we are in it.

00:38.118 --> 00:39.439
Two is best.

00:39.542 --> 00:42.433
As you can see, sometimes in a narrow walkway,...

00:42.665 --> 00:45.194
...it's tough to get more than two spaces side-by-side.

00:45.872 --> 00:47.777
So you can't bring the whole conference room, then...

00:47.861 --> 00:48.617
...that's not gonna happen?

00:48.724 --> 00:49.898
No, leave the PowerPoint at home.

00:50.366 --> 00:51.155
Two is optimal,...

00:51.235 --> 00:52.779
...but you know, a lot of meetings are two people.

00:52.990 --> 00:53.741
Right, that's true.

00:53.913 --> 00:58.020
And other folks I talked to said they liked the phenomenon of being side-by-side.

00:58.143 --> 01:00.395
They like how it feels more equal.

01:00.485 --> 01:02.261
You're not sitting across a big desk.

01:02.707 --> 01:05.258
That kind of erases the hierarchies between coworkers.
