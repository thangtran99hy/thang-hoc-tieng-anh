00:09.635 --> 00:13.095
I'm not surprised, not everything lasts.

00:13.472 --> 00:17.026
I've broken my heart so many times, I stopped keeping track.

00:17.475 --> 00:18.925
I talk myself in.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.085
I talk myself out.

00:21.465 --> 00:25.052
I get all worked up then I let myself down.

00:25.432 --> 00:28.435
And I tried so very hard not to lose it.

00:29.455 --> 00:32.814
I came up with a million excuses.

00:33.411 --> 00:37.176
I thought, I thought of every possibility.

00:39.476 --> 00:42.785
And I know someday it'll all turn out...

00:43.458 --> 00:47.061
...and you'll help me work so we can work to work it out.

00:47.959 --> 00:52.741
And I promise you kid, that I'll give so much more than I get.

00:54.451 --> 00:56.842
I just haven't met you yet.
