Today, I'm gonna take you to Pamukkale, a true wonder of planet Earth.

00:12.079 --> 00:13.496
When you approach from a distance,...

00:13.596 --> 00:17.196
...you might think Pamukkale is a snowy hill or even a glacier,...

00:17.631 --> 00:21.553
...but look closer and you will notice a true wonder of Mother Nature.

00:26.079 --> 00:28.949
Pamukkale's waters are rich in calcium carbonate,...

00:29.313 --> 00:31.992
...making the floors of the pools as soft as cotton.

00:32.503 --> 00:35.552
Actually, in Turkey, it's known as the "cotton castle."

00:37.077 --> 00:40.781
It's not just another thermal spring; it's a geological marvel.

00:41.428 --> 00:45.391
These mineral-rich waters are naturally heated to 36 Celsius.

00:45.628 --> 00:49.123
From ancient times to modern days, people from around the world...

00:49.181 --> 00:52.996
...have come to Pamukkale for its healing and therapeutic effects.
