How many more street corners?

00:12.892 --> 00:13.477
How many more?

00:14.887 --> 00:15.156
Enough.

00:18.726 --> 00:19.669
Demand a plan...

00:20.169 --> 00:20.805
...right now...

00:21.504 --> 00:22.167
...as a mom,...

00:22.483 --> 00:23.077
...as a dad,...

00:23.589 --> 00:24.237
...as a friend,...

00:24.742 --> 00:25.505
...as a husband,...

00:25.903 --> 00:26.528
...as a wife,...

00:26.987 --> 00:28.135
...as a human being.

00:28.579 --> 00:30.428
For the children of Sandy Hook,...

00:31.111 --> 00:32.097
...demand a plan.

00:32.613 --> 00:34.111
No more list of names.

00:34.475 --> 00:35.390
It's not too soon.

00:35.705 --> 00:36.416
It's too late.

00:36.879 --> 00:37.752
Now is the time...

00:38.217 --> 00:40.825
...before we all know someone who loved someone on that list.

00:41.322 --> 00:42.193
No more lists.

00:42.742 --> 00:43.395
No more...

00:43.496 --> 00:45.277
...who they might have been, no more...

00:45.368 --> 00:47.138
...if we had just done something yesterday.

00:47.531 --> 00:48.355
It's time.

00:48.551 --> 00:49.925
We can do better than this.

00:51.932 --> 00:52.543
It's time.

00:53.848 --> 00:55.395
It's time for our leaders to act.

00:55.884 --> 00:56.796
Demand a plan...

00:57.586 --> 00:58.255
...right now.

00:59.802 --> 01:01.189
You, demand it!

01:01.398 --> 01:01.909
Enough.
