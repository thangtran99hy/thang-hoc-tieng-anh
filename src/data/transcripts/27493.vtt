00:00.218 --> 00:02.869
Here are three painless ways to negotiate a better deal.

00:03.393 --> 00:06.615
Number one: Just ask and ask nicely.

00:06.959 --> 00:10.484
Many times, salespeople have the ability to give you an extra discount,...

00:10.853 --> 00:14.877
...so simply say to the salesperson or store manager that you're on a tight budget...

00:15.214 --> 00:17.859
...and you want to know if they could do a better deal on the price.

00:18.249 --> 00:21.159
Odds are they'll knock a few dollars off the price.

00:21.662 --> 00:24.349
Number two: Go for the volume discount.

00:24.816 --> 00:27.195
If you're thinking about buying more than one of something,...

00:27.406 --> 00:30.709
...see if the store can give you a discount for buying multiple items.

00:30.889 --> 00:32.879
Finally, offer to pay cash.

00:33.363 --> 00:36.755
Ask if the store could give you a better deal if you pay cash.

00:37.073 --> 00:41.773
This trick works for contractors, but also many independently-owned stores...

00:41.999 --> 00:43.515
...that are burdened with credit card fees...

00:43.763 --> 00:46.503
...might be willing to give you a better price for cash.
