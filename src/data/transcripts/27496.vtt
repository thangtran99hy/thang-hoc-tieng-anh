ï»¿How do you communicate authentically?

00:02.501 --> 00:06.393
How do you figure out what to say and what not to say in a way that's authentic?

00:07.051 --> 00:09.416
And what Fred says, and I really believe this is true,...

00:09.740 --> 00:13.885
...is it starts from the fundamental understanding that there is no truth:...

00:14.439 --> 00:15.573
...There's my truth, there's your truth,...

00:15.657 --> 00:17.065
...and everything is subjective.

00:17.630 --> 00:20.924
And so, if you always start from the position of "This is what I believe;"...

00:21.017 --> 00:22.435
..."I don't expect you to believe it;"...

00:22.499 --> 00:23.737
..."I don't think you have to believe it;"...

00:23.831 --> 00:25.035
..."I'm not saying it's true;"...

00:25.583 --> 00:27.887
...you can actually always communicate authentically.

00:28.270 --> 00:31.091
'Cause if you walk in the room, and this gets worse as you get more senior,...

00:31.263 --> 00:34.930
..."Here's the answer:" you're not giving anyone else any room to say anything.

00:35.555 --> 00:36.929
And if you walk in the room and say,...

00:37.368 --> 00:39.898
"I believe this for this reason."

00:40.003 --> 00:41.400
"What do you believe?"

00:42.047 --> 00:47.634
If you share your truth in that language, you give people room to authenticate,...

00:47.740 --> 00:49.053
...to communicate authentically.

00:49.739 --> 00:53.218
And that is hugely important to these relationships at any stage.
