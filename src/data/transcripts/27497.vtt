I'm Olivia, I'm 17, and I live in Greenwich, Connecticut.

00:11.375 --> 00:14.170
My favorite things in the world are swimming and science.

00:14.479 --> 00:16.411
My family loves science too.

00:16.555 --> 00:18.082
That's probably where I get it from.

00:20.059 --> 00:23.724
My teacher encouraged us to watch the news and see what was going on in the world.

00:24.153 --> 00:26.718
That's how I became intrigued with the Ebola crisis.

00:26.861 --> 00:32.136
Over 11,000 people died during the 2014 outbreak, which is shocking.

00:32.671 --> 00:36.993
I wanted to help and thought there must be a faster way to diagnose the virus...

00:37.096 --> 00:39.709
...before an outbreak like this grew into an epidemic.

00:40.514 --> 00:45.029
So, my goal was to create a simple, inexpensive diagnostic device for Ebola...

00:45.123 --> 00:47.901
...and transport it without refrigeration.

00:48.100 --> 00:50.929
The results of my experiment were really successful.

00:51.301 --> 00:53.418
I developed the Ebola Assay Card,...

00:53.870 --> 00:56.916
...a device that changes color when the virus has been detected.

00:57.137 --> 00:59.937
It requires no refrigeration for transportation...

01:00.076 --> 01:03.303
...and can confirm in under 30 minutes if someone is infected.

01:03.931 --> 01:07.595
I think imagination and optimism are important parts of innovation.

01:07.827 --> 01:11.739
Teenagers have that, and so they try things that maybe adults think will fail.

01:12.561 --> 01:17.465
One day, I hope to become a doctor and see firsthand how I can make a difference.

01:18.275 --> 01:20.888
And maybe now, I'm one step closer.
