00:01.823 --> 00:04.649
Just when it seemed the champagne days were a thing of the past...

00:04.745 --> 00:06.379
...for Asia's investment bankers,...

00:06.586 --> 00:11.118
...along comes the biggest IPO anywhere in the world this year:...

00:11.265 --> 00:13.685
...the state-owned Postal Savings Bank of China...

00:13.769 --> 00:18.762
...officially announcing its massive 8.2-billion-dollar IPO on Tuesday,...

00:18.933 --> 00:22.660
...eclipsing the other major new listings of 2016.

00:22.889 --> 00:25.483
This is China's 6th biggest bank,...

00:25.611 --> 00:29.400
...with more than 40,000 branches spread across the country.

00:29.629 --> 00:36.669
It's also going to be a 130-million-dollar payday for the banks putting the deal together.

00:36.917 --> 00:40.889
That includes big US players like Bank of America, Merrill Lynch,...

00:40.989 --> 00:44.922
...JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.

00:45.151 --> 00:50.001
This high-profile IPO flies in the face of a rough year for China's economy.

00:50.436 --> 00:54.845
Banks are having a tough time and stock markets are volatile,...

00:55.030 --> 00:58.807
...with Shanghai's index down almost 15 percent this year.

00:59.129 --> 01:03.491
Investors are also deeply worried about a growing pile of souring loans...

01:03.573 --> 01:05.603
...at major banks across the country.

01:05.853 --> 01:08.961
But that's where the appeal of PSBC comes in.

01:09.243 --> 01:12.802
Its stack of loans is much lower than the national average...

01:13.030 --> 01:18.619
...and its jaw-dropping total assets add up to more than a trillion dollars.
