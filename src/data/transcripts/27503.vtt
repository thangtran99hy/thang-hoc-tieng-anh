00:00.276 --> 00:02.766
It's very important that your application is correct,...

00:03.201 --> 00:04.393
...accurate and complete.

00:04.723 --> 00:07.575
Since you're going to be asked about your previous education...

00:07.672 --> 00:08.713
...and employment history,...

00:08.905 --> 00:12.539
...take the time to find out any names, addresses, phone numbers,...

00:12.743 --> 00:15.105
...and dates of employment before filling out the application.

00:16.241 --> 00:18.127
Have at least three references available.

00:18.483 --> 00:21.320
Make sure you have their permission before using them as a reference.

00:21.843 --> 00:23.409
These people can be teachers,...

00:23.577 --> 00:26.098
...members of an organization you volunteered for,...

00:26.506 --> 00:29.505
...or previous employers, don't use family members though.

00:31.543 --> 00:34.895
Using blue or black ink, fill out your personal information...

00:35.069 --> 00:37.158
...like your name, address, and phone number.

00:39.969 --> 00:42.529
When writing leave enough space between each letter,...

00:42.670 --> 00:44.301
...so the words are easily legible.

00:44.960 --> 00:47.184
Be conscious of how much space you are given.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.585
So don't write too big or too small.

00:50.262 --> 00:54.119
In the education section, write down the most recent year of education first.

00:54.788 --> 00:57.473
Include vocational school and training programs...

00:57.860 --> 00:59.423
...as well as college and high school.
