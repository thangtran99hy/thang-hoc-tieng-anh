ï»¿I'm Krtin.

00:07.560 --> 00:09.609
I'm 15, and I live in Surrey in the UK.

00:13.677 --> 00:14.520
I love playing piano,...

00:15.263 --> 00:18.189
...spending time with friends, and most of all, I love squash.

00:18.733 --> 00:19.717
I play as much as I can.

00:20.001 --> 00:20.914
It's the best sport ever.

00:25.540 --> 00:27.482
When I was younger, I had surgery on my ear...

00:27.641 --> 00:29.903
...and since then, I've been interested in how medical science...

00:29.989 --> 00:31.163
...can really change people's lives.

00:32.635 --> 00:33.951
I was reading about Alzheimer's.

00:34.178 --> 00:36.671
It's a devastating disease and it's really hard to diagnose early,...

00:37.127 --> 00:38.488
...so I wanted to help find a solution.

00:44.837 --> 00:47.981
After I did some research, I realized that in Alzheimer's patients,...

00:48.319 --> 00:50.065
...certain proteins appear in the brain sooner...

00:50.462 --> 00:53.319
...and in higher concentrations than in people who don't have the disease.

00:54.299 --> 00:57.073
I created a solution that enters the brain with a simple injection...

00:57.265 --> 00:58.457
...and latches onto the protein.

01:00.466 --> 01:03.055
That allowed me to see exactly how much of the protein was there...

01:03.541 --> 01:05.549
...and decide whether or not the patient had Alzheimer's.

01:07.580 --> 01:09.107
I'm still so amazed that I found a way...

01:09.179 --> 01:11.715
...to successfully diagnose Alzheimer's at an early stage.

01:13.244 --> 01:15.029
Maybe because we're young and still learning.

01:15.152 --> 01:16.572
We're not afraid of trying new things.

01:16.975 --> 01:18.592
We can bring new ideas into the world,...

01:18.867 --> 01:22.927
...and one day, I hope to see my new idea be used by doctors to save lives.
