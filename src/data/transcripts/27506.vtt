ï»¿Hi, I'm Mike.

00:02.438 --> 00:03.243
Hi, I'm Min.

00:03.428 --> 00:04.049
Nice to meet you.

00:04.133 --> 00:04.862
Nice to meet you.

00:05.058 --> 00:07.053
So you're an international student here at Benedictine.

00:07.185 --> 00:09.862
Yeah, I want to open a checking account.

00:10.049 --> 00:10.687
Okay, great.

00:10.914 --> 00:12.582
Do you have a visa?

00:12.791 --> 00:13.153
Yeah.

00:13.461 --> 00:16.717
Is your passport with you? And your student ID; make sure you got them today.

00:19.439 --> 00:20.710
That's all we need.

00:20.954 --> 00:23.537
It's just the visa and the student ID, great.

00:25.919 --> 00:27.100
Okay, perfect.

00:27.549 --> 00:31.700
Alright, all I need you to do is just fill in the first couple box:..

00:31.822 --> 00:33.915
...name, address and day of birth.

00:34.165 --> 00:37.320
And I'll give you an idea a little bit about how the account works.

00:37.492 --> 00:37.979
Okay.

00:39.278 --> 00:44.459
The main benefit and the main features that we have for the Citibank student account...

00:44.883 --> 00:49.353
...is the fact that the account has no fees, absolutely no minimum balance,...

00:49.736 --> 00:52.255
...and there's no social security number required.
