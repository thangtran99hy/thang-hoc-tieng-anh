So Jamal, what made you choose this bank to open an account?

00:03.618 --> 00:05.701
Well, I've heard a lot of good things about this bank.

00:06.109 --> 00:07.430
And I don't live too far from here,...

00:07.530 --> 00:09.314
...so it's pretty convenient for me.

00:09.769 --> 00:11.294
Good, good. Okay, let's get you started.

00:11.786 --> 00:13.450
So what type of account would you like to open?

00:13.541 --> 00:14.979
A savings or a checking account?

00:15.400 --> 00:15.956
I don't know.

00:16.081 --> 00:16.915
Doesn't matter to me.

00:17.283 --> 00:20.161
Well, I was thinking of opening a checking account.

00:20.371 --> 00:25.445
But I'm not sure what the difference is between that or savings account.

00:26.406 --> 00:31.341
Well Jamal, a checking account is an account used to deposit money at a bank.

00:31.963 --> 00:37.319
Money can be added or removed from the account by visiting the bank or writing a check.

00:37.457 --> 00:42.656
If the account earns interest, it's usually at a lower rate than a savings account.

00:42.924 --> 00:44.633
A savings account is an account you have...

00:44.760 --> 00:47.520
...for the purpose of saving money over a period of time.

00:47.860 --> 00:51.062
Only you can take out money you put into your savings account.
