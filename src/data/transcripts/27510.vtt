Please describe your job title and primary duties.

00:04.142 --> 00:07.873
At Canadian Tire, I was a promotional guy so I worked in merchandising.

00:08.669 --> 00:09.809
Basically, I was on the floor.

00:11.301 --> 00:14.338
I wasn't pertained to one specific department,...

00:14.448 --> 00:15.273
...I was sort of everywhere.

00:16.911 --> 00:19.212
I was in charge of making sure that the promotional items,...

00:19.280 --> 00:23.695
...items that were on sale were advertised in an area...

00:23.759 --> 00:25.587
...which were visible to the customer.

00:26.863 --> 00:28.225
I made the skids.

00:28.960 --> 00:33.807
Like I prepared the skids, restocked, faced the aisles, and whatnot.

00:34.469 --> 00:36.083
So, basically that's what I did at Canadian Tire.

00:36.231 --> 00:39.501
And when need be I would go assign push some carts,...

00:39.557 --> 00:40.845
...if they needed me to do that.

00:41.125 --> 00:42.472
I was basically your all-around kind of guy.
