Did you know that cells in your body can recycle pieces of themselves?

00:07.197 --> 00:09.693
It's an incredible process that we're learning more about...

00:09.841 --> 00:11.880
...thanks to the work of one Japanese scientist.

00:12.291 --> 00:16.363
Yoshinori Ohsumi was awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine...

00:16.419 --> 00:20.140
...on October 3rd for his work in understanding how cells recycle...

00:20.195 --> 00:22.159
...their own damaged or worn-out content.

00:22.609 --> 00:24.329
The process is called autophagy,...

00:24.489 --> 00:27.277
...a term that means "self-eating" and it's a real lifesaver.

00:27.487 --> 00:31.144
Cells will break down proteins and use them for energy if a person is starving.

00:31.635 --> 00:35.137
The process also allows cells to destroy viruses and bad bacteria.

00:35.618 --> 00:39.187
Ohsumi has been studying autophagy for decades using baker's yeast.

00:39.602 --> 00:42.607
His work has helped shed light on how problems with autophagy...

00:42.710 --> 00:45.192
...can contribute to diseases like cancer and Parkinson's.

00:45.695 --> 00:48.078
David Rubinsztein with the Institute for Medical Research...

00:48.170 --> 00:50.938
...at the University of Cambridge told The Associated Press...

00:51.027 --> 00:53.471
...Ohsumi's work quote "opened the door to a field."
