00:03.217 --> 00:05.683
ï»¿You are so beautiful.

00:06.848 --> 00:08.788
I got accepted to Boston University.

00:08.934 --> 00:10.028
I'm so proud of you.

00:10.220 --> 00:11.999
Why do you care, you won't be around to see it anyway.

00:13.091 --> 00:18.191
My mama had been the sun to me and Mr. Church, he was like the moon:...

00:18.693 --> 00:21.009
...cool, calm and always there.

00:25.497 --> 00:26.407
What's gonna happen now?

00:26.701 --> 00:28.289
I think you should call Boston University...

00:28.356 --> 00:30.211
...and tell them that Charlotte Brooks will be attending.

00:32.783 --> 00:35.397
Come on Charlie, you can't go living with your cook forever.

00:35.567 --> 00:36.057
My cook?

00:36.377 --> 00:39.241
Richard set aside enough money for Mama to live six months.

00:39.387 --> 00:42.007
Do you know who paid all of our bills all those years after that?

00:42.365 --> 00:42.921
Mr. Church.

00:43.313 --> 00:44.115
He saved us.

00:45.265 --> 00:46.253
Do you have a place to stay?

00:46.404 --> 00:46.951
She lives with me.

00:47.735 --> 00:50.220
You gave me the most important thing life can offer.
