00:00.939 --> 00:05.669
I've seen the whole of Banff National Park, which is just a marvelous place.

00:05.928 --> 00:07.433
And I've seen so much wildlife.

00:07.537 --> 00:08.753
It's so accessible here.

00:08.839 --> 00:09.567
It's everywhere.

00:10.546 --> 00:11.765
It's a huge nest.

00:12.788 --> 00:15.877
Every wildlife encounter I have has an emotional effect on me...

00:16.229 --> 00:18.441
...because it changes your knowledge of something.

00:20.986 --> 00:23.294
There's a rush that comes from seeing wildlife.

00:23.541 --> 00:24.657
It's so exciting.

00:24.806 --> 00:28.038
And once you've felt it, you want to keep doing it.
