00:00.885 --> 00:03.575
Fixing up a car to drive in it again,...

00:03.739 --> 00:06.450
...searching for the water, hoping for the rain...

00:06.545 --> 00:07.753
...up and up,...

00:09.333 --> 00:10.814
...up and up.

00:12.662 --> 00:15.399
Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal,...

00:15.659 --> 00:18.193
...waiting for a chance to pick your orange field,...

00:18.302 --> 00:19.477
...up and up,...

00:21.103 --> 00:23.103
...up and up.

00:24.140 --> 00:27.080
See a pearl form a diamond in the rough,...

00:27.203 --> 00:29.703
...see a bird soaring high above the flood.

00:29.812 --> 00:30.794
It's in your blood,...

00:32.657 --> 00:35.873
...it's in your blood.

00:36.073 --> 00:38.743
Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying,...

00:38.831 --> 00:41.587
..."Sitting with the poison takes away the pain."

00:41.687 --> 00:42.627
Up and up,...

00:44.537 --> 00:45.783
...up and up.

00:46.701 --> 00:51.033
It's saying we're gonna get it, get it together right now,...

00:51.137 --> 00:53.913
...gonna get it, get it together somehow.

00:54.049 --> 00:57.066
We're gonna get it, get it together and flower.

00:59.478 --> 01:02.709
We're gonna get it, get it together I know.

01:02.836 --> 01:05.651
We're gonna get it, get it together and flow.

01:05.779 --> 01:08.872
We're gonna get it, get it together and go...

01:09.681 --> 01:11.838
...up and up and up.
