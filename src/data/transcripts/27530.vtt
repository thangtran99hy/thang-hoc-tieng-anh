00:00.580 --> 00:03.268
All organizations have some form of hierarchy.

00:03.738 --> 00:05.987
People in organizations, if you're their manager,...

00:06.599 --> 00:08.133
...will do what you tell them to do...

00:08.440 --> 00:10.595
...even at Facebook, at least some of the time.

00:11.799 --> 00:13.644
But great leaders don't want compliance.

00:13.749 --> 00:15.485
They don't want people to follow orders.

00:16.124 --> 00:20.695
Great leaders want real excitement, genuine enthusiasm, real commitment.

00:21.642 --> 00:25.626
Great leaders don't just win the minds of their team, they win their hearts.

00:26.523 --> 00:28.563
Great leaders don't just issue commands,...

00:29.003 --> 00:30.936
...they heed the voices of those around them.
