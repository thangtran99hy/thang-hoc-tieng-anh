I am a firm believer that whether you are running a ten-person company...

00:04.067 --> 00:06.317
...or a 50-person, not-for-profit organization,...

00:06.398 --> 00:08.345
...you are only as good as the people who work for you.

00:08.441 --> 00:10.441
What I did at eBay is I had a phrase:...

00:10.939 --> 00:13.797
..."I need the right person in the right job at the right time...

00:13.871 --> 00:15.222
...with the right values and behaviors."

00:15.287 --> 00:17.675
And if you do that, gosh, things are so much easier.

00:17.779 --> 00:20.033
It's curiosity that gets people excited.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.969
Curiosity leads to new ideas.

00:23.054 --> 00:27.671
Curiosity leads to new jobs, new industries,...

00:27.745 --> 00:29.902
...and it perpetuates itself...

00:29.994 --> 00:36.508
...because it's this never-ending cycle of "What if?" and followed by "Why not?"

00:36.738 --> 00:38.979
The hardest thing for me was to learn how to say no...

00:40.114 --> 00:41.953
...and to make some people unhappy.
