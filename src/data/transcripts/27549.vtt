00:03.113 --> 00:05.416
ï»¿We boarded the Avalon with a destination.

00:06.399 --> 00:10.931
120 years hibernation means a wake-up on a new century, on a new planet.

00:13.220 --> 00:16.019
But a year ago, everything changed.

00:17.553 --> 00:20.997
Hello, anybody here?

00:21.525 --> 00:22.017
Hello?

00:24.935 --> 00:26.565
Do you know what's going on?

00:26.877 --> 00:28.192
Nobody else is awake.

00:28.543 --> 00:30.576
I think something went wrong with the hibernation pods.

00:31.668 --> 00:32.644
We woke up too soon,...

00:33.733 --> 00:35.393
...ninety years too soon.

00:36.151 --> 00:38.536
This can't be happening, we have to go back to sleep.

00:38.751 --> 00:39.327
We can't.

00:40.523 --> 00:42.721
Aurora, we love you!

00:49.919 --> 00:50.770
Something's wrong.

00:52.242 --> 00:53.187
Something big.

00:57.463 --> 00:58.829
There's something I have to tell you.

01:07.993 --> 01:09.990
There's a reason we woke up early.
