00:00.050 --> 00:01.252
A number of women have come forward.

00:01.356 --> 00:03.139
They've made allegations against your husband.

00:03.626 --> 00:05.773
Some of them go back more than 30 years.

00:06.035 --> 00:07.071
He's said they're lying.

00:07.179 --> 00:07.907
Do you believe him?

00:08.817 --> 00:10.018
I believe my husband.

00:10.444 --> 00:11.275
I believe my husband.

00:11.371 --> 00:14.015
This was all organized from the opposition.

00:14.743 --> 00:24.910
And with the details, did they ever check the background of these women?

00:26.151 --> 00:28.318
They don't have any facts.

00:29.148 --> 00:34.764
And even the story that came out in People magazine,...

00:35.719 --> 00:40.157
...the writer that, she said that my husband took her to the room...

00:40.923 --> 00:42.503
...and start kissing her.

00:43.019 --> 00:50.430
She wrote in the same story about me that she saw me on 5th Avenue and I said to her,...

00:51.119 --> 00:54.722
"Natasha, how come we don't see you anymore?"

00:55.593 --> 00:56.928
I was never friend with her.

00:57.304 --> 00:58.864
I would not recognize her.

00:59.127 --> 00:59.961
That never happened?

01:00.102 --> 01:00.982
Never happened.
