ï»¿They said only skinny girls can dress well.

00:03.966 --> 00:07.403
I just remembered the sales associate, "Ooh, it will cover her up better."

00:07.506 --> 00:08.755
"We'll hide the stomach better."

00:08.835 --> 00:10.141
"We'll hide her arms better."

00:10.699 --> 00:12.303
They told me that I had to hide.

00:12.593 --> 00:14.317
They told me that I wasn't pretty enough.

00:14.589 --> 00:16.037
They told me that I wasn't thin enough.

00:16.188 --> 00:17.462
I just wasn't enough.

00:19.713 --> 00:23.184
I decided that I needed to be the role model I needed when I was younger.

00:23.275 --> 00:25.959
So, I started my fashion blog.

00:26.110 --> 00:28.349
I want to say, "It's fine to be the way you are."

00:28.445 --> 00:30.704
"You don't have to feel sorry for who I am."

00:30.777 --> 00:34.080
"I'm gonna do what makes me look and feel good."

00:35.528 --> 00:38.512
My style is unapologetic, 100%.

00:40.183 --> 00:43.011
I get stopped all the time by other women.

00:43.136 --> 00:44.121
"I love your outfit."

00:44.206 --> 00:46.367
"I love the way you did your hair, your makeup."

00:46.918 --> 00:50.047
That's the perfect touch to any outfit, is a beautiful dog.

00:50.248 --> 00:53.531
He is gonna look perfect like all my outfits all the time.
