00:01.492 --> 00:04.471
I'll be seeing you...

00:04.935 --> 00:09.232
...in all the old familiar places...

00:09.439 --> 00:13.657
...that this heart of mine embraces...

00:13.751 --> 00:14.935
...all day through.

00:17.541 --> 00:21.054
In that small cafe,...

00:21.168 --> 00:24.568
...the park across the way,...

00:24.771 --> 00:28.516
...the children's carousel,...

00:28.949 --> 00:32.750
...the chestnut trees, the wishing well.

00:33.062 --> 00:36.315
I'll be seeing you...

00:36.753 --> 00:40.485
...in every lovely summer's day,...

00:40.829 --> 00:44.435
...in everything that's light and gay,...

00:44.533 --> 00:48.459
...I'll always think of you that way.

00:48.577 --> 00:52.666
I'll find you in the morning sun...

00:52.761 --> 00:56.271
...and when the night is new,...

00:56.463 --> 00:58.890
...I'll be looking at the moon...

00:59.306 --> 01:02.867
...but I'll be seeing you.
