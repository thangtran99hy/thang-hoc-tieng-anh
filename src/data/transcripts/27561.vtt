00:02.879 --> 00:05.182
What's the most dangerous place on Earth?

00:06.571 --> 00:08.711
Syria? Sudan?

00:09.165 --> 00:13.697
No, the most dangerous place on Earth is right there: Cherna.

00:15.005 --> 00:17.493
Cartels, militias, terrorist groups,...

00:17.658 --> 00:19.733
..they all need a place to park their cash...

00:19.862 --> 00:21.669
...and Cherna's their dirty little piggy bank.

00:21.956 --> 00:24.716
We're going to insert into the country while nobody is looking,...

00:24.841 --> 00:26.808
...locate the assets and secure them.

00:26.926 --> 00:28.173
We're gonna steal their money, sir?

00:29.079 --> 00:30.559
No, we are going to destroy it.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.882
Everybody down now!

00:38.162 --> 00:39.688
Jump or die!

00:49.439 --> 00:50.414
Who the hell are you?

00:50.715 --> 00:51.902
Our chopper was shot down.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.023
The squad is dead.

00:53.291 --> 00:55.078
You wanna trust a bunch of Blackwater mercs?

00:55.213 --> 00:57.980
Anything we find on the ground is ours, understood?

00:58.567 --> 00:59.182
Understood.

01:00.257 --> 01:02.212
As long as we're stuck here, we're gonna finish this mission.

01:02.976 --> 01:04.098
What's this mission of yours?

01:07.783 --> 01:09.197
If we stay here, we're gonna die!

01:09.648 --> 01:10.809
Then we die!
