ï»¿You might have heard the Great Barrier Reef is dead.

00:02.695 --> 00:03.406
It's not.

00:03.552 --> 00:05.376
At least, not according to scientists.

00:05.559 --> 00:10.355
Rowan Jacobsen wrote an obituary for the 25-million-year-old reef early this week.

00:10.575 --> 00:12.754
The problem: people believed it.

00:12.992 --> 00:14.929
Not only did that article make its rounds,...

00:15.005 --> 00:18.473
...but a ton of clickbait spin-offs also claiming the reef died...

00:18.559 --> 00:20.185
...took over social media too.

00:20.382 --> 00:23.409
We know the world's largest coral reef isn't in tip-top shape,...

00:23.517 --> 00:26.437
...but we don't need to plan a funeral for it just yet.

00:26.571 --> 00:28.369
That's not to say there isn't room for worry.

00:28.536 --> 00:30.767
Reports show that over the past three decades,...

00:30.845 --> 00:33.416
...almost half of the reef's coral has vanished.

00:33.525 --> 00:35.773
That decline has to do with a variety of things,...

00:35.875 --> 00:38.384
...and most of them can be traced back to humans.

00:38.519 --> 00:40.942
Warming ocean temperatures due to climate change...

00:41.026 --> 00:43.639
...have seriously increased rates of coral bleaching.

00:43.891 --> 00:48.369
This year, the reef has experienced the worst coral bleaching in recorded history,...

00:48.561 --> 00:52.133
...not to mention the harmful effects of coastal development and pollution.

00:52.303 --> 00:53.403
But there is some hope.

00:53.575 --> 00:57.239
Scientists say tighter controls on pollution could help the coral survive.

00:57.486 --> 01:00.108
For now, Rowan's obituary is unnecessary,...

01:00.279 --> 01:04.533
...but the Great Barrier Reef's future could be short if changes aren't made soon.

01:04.991 --> 01:06.771
