Hey guys, I'm Demi Lovato.

00:02.686 --> 00:05.339
I'm on tour here in Denver and this is Undercover Lyft.

00:07.151 --> 00:08.901
Nice to meet you, I'm Samantha.

00:08.969 --> 00:09.322
Hi Samantha.

00:09.377 --> 00:10.117
You can call me Sam.

00:10.507 --> 00:11.564
I love Lyft.

00:11.672 --> 00:12.626
I just started.

00:12.764 --> 00:13.688
Oh, that's awesome.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.579
Yeah, its like a job that's cool for the summer.

00:16.921 --> 00:18.199
Do you do anything else besides Lyft?

00:19.269 --> 00:22.210
I actually really wanna be a singer someday.

00:22.696 --> 00:27.671
I have actually been travelling the country with my ex-boyfriend's brother...

00:29.195 --> 00:33.256
...'cause he sings too and so, we really want to kinda get our names out there.

00:33.349 --> 00:35.533
Open mic nights and like, whatever we can do.

00:36.447 --> 00:37.713
What type of music do you listen to?

00:38.120 --> 00:38.951
Have you ever met her?

00:39.507 --> 00:40.132
God, no.

00:40.437 --> 00:40.696
No?

00:40.751 --> 00:41.509
That would be amazing.

00:41.715 --> 00:41.994
That would be amazing?

00:42.052 --> 00:42.753
Are you kidding me?

00:42.984 --> 00:46.129
Oh okay cool, 'cause are you sure you've never met her before?

00:47.030 --> 00:48.978
I just insulted the hell out of you.

00:49.101 --> 00:49.959
I'm so sorry.

00:50.021 --> 00:50.656
It's okay.

00:50.832 --> 00:52.102
Oh my god, I love you.

00:52.267 --> 00:52.813
Oh my God.

00:52.873 --> 00:56.093
I totally got you to sing Camp Rock songs, everyone's gonna hear.
