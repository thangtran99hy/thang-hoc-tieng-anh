That's right, McDonald's Japan is jumping on the pumpkin spice bandwagon this Halloween...

00:12.863 --> 00:14.494

"The flavors of pumpkin and chocolate went unexpectedly well," this person said.

00:29.059 --> 00:31.830

McDonald's Japan said the idea for pumpkin and chocolate flavored fries...

00:38.558 --> 00:41.931
