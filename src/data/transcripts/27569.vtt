00:01.552 --> 00:05.000
Soaring, swooping, fluttering high.

00:05.398 --> 00:08.661
The bats are circling in the sky.

00:09.404 --> 00:12.633
Black as pitch with piercing eyes.

00:12.935 --> 00:16.784
Noisy with their shrieking cries.

00:17.112 --> 00:20.189
Leathery skin and folded wings.

00:20.344 --> 00:24.319
Scary, creepy, threatening things.

00:24.917 --> 00:28.055
Upside down, they hang to sleep.

00:28.615 --> 00:32.219
Waking when the dark is deep.

00:32.677 --> 00:35.404
Blind but still they seem to see.

00:35.543 --> 00:38.473
Nervous folk like you and me.

00:39.072 --> 00:42.675
Soaring, swooping, fluttering high.

00:43.191 --> 00:47.599
Let's hope the bats stay in the sky!
