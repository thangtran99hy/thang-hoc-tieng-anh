This is going to be a super easy and simple eyebrow tutorial...

00:02.983 --> 00:03.939
...and great for beginners.

00:04.005 --> 00:06.965
So, if you guys wanna see what my tips are, keep watching.

00:07.305 --> 00:11.573
So to start off, it's really important to give your eyebrows a nice comb-through.

00:11.805 --> 00:14.029
You can either use a clean mascara wand for this step...

00:14.173 --> 00:17.285
...or what I like to use is the Anastasia Brow Whiz Pencil.

00:17.649 --> 00:20.437
It's got the comb and the colored pencil on the opposite side.

00:20.875 --> 00:24.159
After watching a ton of videos and asking my friends that are makeup artists,...

00:24.255 --> 00:26.777
...I finally found a technique that works for my eyebrows.

00:27.077 --> 00:30.121
So the first step is to create that line on the bottom part of your eyebrow.

00:30.443 --> 00:32.311
Then, create a line above as well.

00:32.759 --> 00:35.572
It's also really important to use soft and quick strokes.

00:35.897 --> 00:38.713
You don't wanna press too hard because that will make it look too drawn on...

00:38.822 --> 00:41.333
...and when it comes to your eyebrows, you want them to look kinda natural.

00:41.873 --> 00:45.434
So, when you're happy with the outline, fill the inside areas with feathery strokes.

00:45.829 --> 00:48.039
Then, flip the pencil over and use the comb...

00:48.097 --> 00:50.636
...to go over your entire eyebrow really softly.

00:51.108 --> 00:52.335
This part might take some time...

00:52.409 --> 00:54.651
...so you may need to go over some areas if you need to.
