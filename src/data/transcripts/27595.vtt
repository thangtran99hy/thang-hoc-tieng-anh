In chess, in the beginning of the game, we wanna bring out our army...

00:09.496 --> 00:12.050
...and get it ready to fight and we also wanna make sure that our king is safe.

00:12.718 --> 00:16.635
A lot of teachers use what is called as the "ten golden moves"...

00:16.806 --> 00:19.677
...or sometimes it's also known as "the bull's head."

00:19.875 --> 00:20.568
Let me demonstrate.

00:21.365 --> 00:24.596
White brings up the pawn, a pawn, to the center.

00:25.505 --> 00:27.666
His goal is then to bring up the other pawn to the center.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.916
The two pawns in the center are what is known as a "duo".

00:30.384 --> 00:32.087
It's a very valuable thing to have.

00:32.168 --> 00:36.309
It acts like a shield and you can develop your pieces around and behind it.

00:37.078 --> 00:39.501
You can develop one knight here to F3.

00:39.615 --> 00:41.120
The other knight goes to C3.

00:41.615 --> 00:43.033
This is four golden moves.

00:43.381 --> 00:46.187
White brings up a bishop, five golden moves,...

00:46.435 --> 00:48.470
...brings up the other bishop, six golden moves.

00:48.841 --> 00:51.556
The king castles, gets to safety, seven golden moves,...

00:52.157 --> 00:55.337
...brings up the queen to get out of the way of the rooks, eight golden moves.

00:55.753 --> 00:58.312
Nine and ten, the rooks come to the middle of the board.

00:58.995 --> 01:00.809
And these are the ten golden moves.

01:00.886 --> 01:02.461
It's also known as "the bull's head."

01:02.618 --> 01:05.716
The two center pawns are supposed to represent the forehead of the bull.

01:06.311 --> 01:07.929
The bishops are like its horns.

01:08.429 --> 01:11.625
And the rest of the pieces behind the two center pawns...

01:11.749 --> 01:15.460
...are like the body of the bull and this whole unit is ready to go...

01:15.520 --> 01:18.820
...and start marching down the board and go get the black king.

01:19.818 --> 01:21.742
These are known as the "Ten Golden Moves".

01:22.067 --> 01:25.612
You might not be able to get your pieces unto these exact squares...

01:25.697 --> 01:26.480
...every time yourself.

01:26.580 --> 01:29.859
In fact, it's your opponent's job to try to stop you from being able to do that.

01:30.376 --> 01:32.860
But this is the sort of thing you're trying to do...

01:32.924 --> 01:34.323
...with your pieces in the opening.
