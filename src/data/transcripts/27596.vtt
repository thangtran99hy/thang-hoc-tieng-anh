00:02.503 --> 00:05.069
So we've entered the Catacombs, and this is pretty insane.

00:05.464 --> 00:10.426
The bones of thousands and thousands of Parisians are piled one on top of another.

00:10.827 --> 00:13.170
And they were brought here because the plague was,...

00:13.634 --> 00:17.279
...disease was like running rampant at the time from the cemeteries,...

00:17.335 --> 00:18.715
...seeping into the water system and everything.

00:18.803 --> 00:20.408
So, this is why they're in the Catacombs.

00:20.639 --> 00:23.597
Pretty intricate work, how all the bones are stacked on top of each other...

00:23.678 --> 00:24.691
...with the skulls on top.

00:30.067 --> 00:33.029
All the bones here in the Catacombs are stacked in sections,...

00:33.359 --> 00:39.341
...and in front of each one is the sign which tells you where the bones came from,...

00:39.419 --> 00:42.681
...which cemetery, as well as what date they were all stacked here.
