00:00.559 --> 00:04.707
Constructed in New Taipei City, Taiwan in 1978,...

00:05.187 --> 00:08.255
...the Sanzhi UFO Houses were a bold move...

00:08.601 --> 00:11.341
...towards an experimental, pod-shaped architecture,...

00:12.041 --> 00:15.478
...quickly becoming a ghost town after being considered cursed.

00:16.266 --> 00:20.519
This increased its popularity as an unofficial tourist destination,...

00:20.993 --> 00:24.785
...which also led to more accidents and deaths over time.

00:26.480 --> 00:31.723
Located in upstate New York, the Willard Asylum has been abandoned for a long time,...

00:32.035 --> 00:34.758
...creating an additional look of neglect.

00:35.427 --> 00:39.675
Old pieces of furniture, medical equipment and even suitcases...

00:39.760 --> 00:43.212
...abandoned when the place was closed, are strewn about.

00:43.867 --> 00:48.718
The atmosphere that the Willard Asylum has is among the creepiest in the world.

00:50.231 --> 00:54.191
Created as part of an art exhibit in 1965,...

00:54.791 --> 00:59.082
...three statues of Christ were sunk to the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.

00:59.985 --> 01:03.825
Copies were made and one was sunk off the coast of Florida.

01:04.523 --> 01:08.955
Massive in scale, they tower over any person scuba diving around them...

01:09.249 --> 01:14.487
...and remain utterly surreal when surrounded by the whiteness of the ocean floor.
