00:04.600 --> 00:07.815
Well, my chess career really began in California.

00:07.890 --> 00:10.929
My brother was a junior player when he was quite young...

00:11.141 --> 00:14.104
..and so, because of that, he would go and play tournaments...

00:14.184 --> 00:16.665
...around the United States and I would end up going along.

00:16.761 --> 00:19.528
And through that, I just sort of, just by being around chess,...

00:19.596 --> 00:22.667
...I got into the game and eventually I started playing it.

00:27.165 --> 00:28.587
I think it's very different.

00:28.657 --> 00:29.931
For me, I was homeschooled,...

00:30.137 --> 00:32.685
...which gave me many opportunities to travel around the country...

00:32.747 --> 00:34.846
...also to travel a lot in Europe to compete...

00:35.211 --> 00:37.562
...against some of the best kids in the world.

00:37.733 --> 00:40.952
And so, because of this, I had the opportunity to see a lot of different cultures,...

00:41.048 --> 00:42.436
...meet a lot of different people,...

00:42.525 --> 00:44.519
...whereas had I not played chess,...

00:44.585 --> 00:46.642
...I probably would have only been exposed to people...

00:46.765 --> 00:49.922
...from similar backgrounds as myself and only in America.

00:50.277 --> 00:52.562
So, I think it really broadened my horizons.

00:59.164 --> 01:01.709
And I think it doesn't matter what sport you play,...
