Draw an uneven line on your cheek or any other place on your face or body.

00:07.041 --> 00:10.657
Once you have done this, add more color to your uneven line.

00:11.133 --> 00:14.477
As a result, you would need to have a base of your planned scar.

00:16.811 --> 00:20.505
Now, move on to the scarring liquid which is called rigid collodion.

00:21.201 --> 00:23.632
When you apply rigid collodion unto the skin,...

00:23.899 --> 00:26.432
...it dries out and as a result, it tenses up the skin...

00:26.531 --> 00:29.299
...and thus visually creates the effect of the scar.

00:29.941 --> 00:34.501
Apply the product in multiple layers and let it dry a minute in between.

00:34.816 --> 00:39.668
Now, the next step is to remove some shine that the dried product has on your skin.

00:40.128 --> 00:43.100
All you need to do is set your scar with some powder...

00:46.443 --> 00:48.994
...and then on top, add some concealer.

00:55.779 --> 00:59.268
Finally, to give your scar the appearance of the new injury,...

00:59.587 --> 01:04.105
...as if it is still healing, add some pink lipstick or lip gloss on top.

01:05.443 --> 01:08.430
Blend it with your fingers for a more realistic look.

01:13.471 --> 01:14.951
And here's the final result.
