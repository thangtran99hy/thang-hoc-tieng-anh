Hi, I'm Steve Hassenplug and this is Monster Chess.

00:05.087 --> 00:07.595
It's a very large Lego chess set.

00:07.779 --> 00:10.097
It took four of us about a year to design and build.

00:10.867 --> 00:12.860
There's about a hundred thousand LEGO pieces...

00:13.525 --> 00:15.541
...and it's about $30,000 worth of Lego.

00:16.401 --> 00:19.236
If you look at it, you can see all the pieces are of different heights.

00:19.651 --> 00:22.714
So, like the more important pieces are the bigger heights,...

00:22.836 --> 00:24.436
...which is the way it really is in chess.

00:24.958 --> 00:28.587
The higher-ranking pieces will actually have actions that they can do...

00:28.643 --> 00:31.559
...like the knight, whenever it's moving, it actually runs its legs...

00:31.617 --> 00:32.881
...so you can see the legs moving.

00:33.843 --> 00:37.294
The rook actually has a cannon that'll fire when it puts a king in check.

00:38.191 --> 00:41.307
The queen and king both have a scepter that they rap...

00:42.289 --> 00:43.715
...and then the bishop has a candle.

00:45.468 --> 00:47.589
And the pawns are just pawns, they don't really do anything.
