Hey y'all! In today's video, I'll be showing you how to contour...

00:02.968 --> 00:03.944
...even if you're a beginner.

00:04.213 --> 00:08.397
First step, I'll be using the TruBlend Contour Palette to contour my face.

00:08.697 --> 00:12.953
I'll be starting out with this darker color here to go ahead and imitate shadow.

00:13.987 --> 00:16.059
So, the reason why we like to contour our faces...

00:16.164 --> 00:19.824
...is just to give you a more chiseled and lean look to your face.

00:19.965 --> 00:24.281
So, adding it to my forehead here, to my cheekbones, a little bit to my nose,...

00:24.438 --> 00:27.945
...I added contour wherever I want to create shadow.

00:29.017 --> 00:29.627
Okay, now blend.

00:30.436 --> 00:33.177
I like to actually moisten this sponge before I blend...

00:33.236 --> 00:36.715
...and it just helps kinda spread the product out a little bit more evenly.

00:37.055 --> 00:40.885
And what I like a lot about this product is that it's oil-free but it's super creamy...

00:40.949 --> 00:44.192
...so you can blend really nicely without putting a lot of effort into it.

00:45.962 --> 00:49.861
I'm gonna take this golden color and start putting it on my cheekbones...

00:49.918 --> 00:53.128
...and anywhere  that I want to project my facial features out.

00:54.158 --> 00:56.962
So, anywhere that I see the natural light hitting my face,...

00:57.309 --> 00:58.607
...that's where I'm gonna put my highlight.

00:58.780 --> 01:00.939
Again, highlighting meaning going to attract light...

01:01.055 --> 01:02.702
...to those different parts of your face.

01:05.023 --> 01:07.793
Step number three is going to be using our medium brown...

01:07.896 --> 01:11.015
...to create some transition from our highlight to our contour.

01:11.393 --> 01:13.141
So, it's gonna warm up our face just a bit.

01:14.042 --> 01:16.962
Step number four is going to be setting your face with a powder.

01:17.233 --> 01:20.462
So, I'm going to be using the Queen Collection Matte pressed powder...

01:20.753 --> 01:21.649
...to set all over.

01:22.187 --> 01:23.942
This is gonna make my makeup last.
