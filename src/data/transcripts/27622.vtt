00:00.125 --> 00:02.252
ï»¿The first wave of coffee started with companies...

00:02.590 --> 00:04.989
...like Folgers, Maxwell House and Nestle.

00:05.609 --> 00:08.149
They took coffee out of the primordial ooze as it were...

00:08.527 --> 00:10.722
...and into every office and home in America.

00:11.284 --> 00:14.294
They brought us things like vacuum packaging, insta-coffee,...

00:14.503 --> 00:17.157
...and catchy slogans like, "The best part of waking up."

00:17.740 --> 00:22.090
Their coffee was known for being relatively bitter, bland and weak-tasting.

00:22.577 --> 00:26.160
Second wave coffee began in direct response to this lack of quality.

00:26.654 --> 00:29.395
Places like Peet's and Starbucks came up with new ways ...

00:29.512 --> 00:32.019
...to distribute a fresher, higher-quality product.

00:32.825 --> 00:36.693
They popularized things like espressos and lattes and baristas,...

00:37.229 --> 00:39.938
...and they educated consumers about where their beans came from...

00:40.218 --> 00:41.271
...and how they're roasted.

00:41.518 --> 00:44.313
When second wave brands made their way into supermarkets...

00:44.426 --> 00:48.021
...and unto retail shelves, this paved the way for third wave coffee.

00:48.672 --> 00:50.848
Companies like Stumptown and Intelligentsia...

00:51.204 --> 00:53.955
...peg their quality to their unique retail experience.

00:54.739 --> 00:58.219
The place and the proprietors became a bigger part of the story,...

00:58.687 --> 01:01.555
...almost as important, some would say, as the brew itself.

01:02.356 --> 01:03.353
Price versus Quality.

01:04.183 --> 01:05.399
Will mainline customers,...

01:05.645 --> 01:08.229
...the type of people who buy their coffee at the supermarket,...

01:08.764 --> 01:12.557
...accept the higher premiums and promised quality from third wave roasters,...

01:13.022 --> 01:15.999
...or will they just continue buying the more cost-conscious...

01:16.359 --> 01:17.595
...and approachable second wave?
