This is one of my least favorites. This is called the "limp fish."

00:07.171 --> 00:07.801
How's it going?

00:07.911 --> 00:08.370
Pretty good.

00:09.639 --> 00:10.659
I mean, did he just die?

00:12.729 --> 00:15.343
"Stick shift": one party goes for the fist bump,...

00:15.480 --> 00:17.231
...the other party goes for the regular handshake.

00:17.305 --> 00:21.116
It's a nightmare scenario when both parties switch to alternate forms...

00:21.197 --> 00:22.301
...at the last possible second.

00:24.315 --> 00:24.983
I want to go home.

00:25.639 --> 00:26.662
The "moist palm."

00:26.973 --> 00:27.422
How's it going?

00:27.537 --> 00:28.280
Hey, I'm good. How are you?

00:30.246 --> 00:31.538
This next one's called the "showdown."

00:31.631 --> 00:34.742
You hold down a little too long and squeeze a little more tightly,...

00:35.249 --> 00:38.245
...trying to assert your manliness over the other party,...

00:38.364 --> 00:39.727
...never breaking eye contact.

00:39.875 --> 00:40.479
Hey, how's it going?

00:40.579 --> 00:41.599
I'm pretty good, how are you?

00:41.723 --> 00:42.263
I'm good.

00:43.204 --> 00:43.840
How are you?

00:44.305 --> 00:45.247
Did you try the chips?

00:45.957 --> 00:46.326
Good.

00:46.407 --> 00:47.045
Delicious.

00:47.119 --> 00:48.475
Really good guac, isn't it?

00:48.912 --> 00:49.181
Yeah.

00:49.371 --> 00:50.873
This next one's called the "dap."

00:51.544 --> 00:55.442
Thumb over thumb, hand in hand, light chest bump/hug.

00:55.597 --> 00:56.340
Give me some of that.

00:56.442 --> 00:57.011
You good, man?

00:57.103 --> 00:57.481
Yeah, I'm great.

00:58.172 --> 01:00.751
Put the cherry on top with that one and add a "bro" in the end.

01:00.847 --> 01:01.217
What's up, bro?

01:01.711 --> 01:03.589
This next one's called the "dap gone wrong."

01:03.667 --> 01:06.713
One person thinks it's a handshake, the other one thinks it's a hug.

01:07.025 --> 01:10.748
It just leads to this mess of uncomfortable weirdness.

01:10.845 --> 01:11.561
Hey, what's up man?

01:14.789 --> 01:15.994
This is called the "hail Caesar."

01:16.077 --> 01:18.843
You're at the gym. Your buddy introduces you to somebody.

01:18.933 --> 01:21.291
You go to shake his hand. He goes right past your hand...

01:21.377 --> 01:23.548
...and grabs your forearm like a Greco-Roman wrestler.

01:23.860 --> 01:24.511
Good to meet you.

01:26.357 --> 01:27.599
What, is he going to shoot the leg now?

01:28.713 --> 01:32.475
Best handshake, in my opinion, of all time is just a great, firm handshake.

01:32.568 --> 01:33.914
Get in, get out, get it done.
