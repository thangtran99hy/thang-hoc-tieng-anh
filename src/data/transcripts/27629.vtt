ï»¿Seeing life from the heavens,...

00:04.327 --> 00:09.695
...looking down, helps us be more aware of the incredible nature of our world.

00:11.292 --> 00:12.828
That's what our brand is all about:...

00:13.239 --> 00:18.915
...helping you capture and relive experiences that celebrate you as a human.

00:19.540 --> 00:20.794
And that's why we built Karma.

00:27.220 --> 00:31.647
It's not just aerial, it's not just handheld, it's not just wearable or mountable,...

00:31.888 --> 00:33.552
...Karma is all of these things.

00:33.874 --> 00:34.815
It's a complete system.

00:36.455 --> 00:39.915
There's a lot of very complicated technology that goes into making Karma.

00:40.054 --> 00:44.083
Our challenge was really to take something that is conventionally very complex...

00:44.203 --> 00:47.708
...and simplify it enough that anyone can go take Karma...

00:47.849 --> 00:50.710
...and put it up in the air with no problem whatsoever.

00:53.604 --> 00:57.480
From the get-go, we set out to design Karma to be incredibly portable.

00:57.821 --> 01:03.591
We didn't want you to have to ask yourself, "Do I want to take Karma today?"

01:03.891 --> 01:06.937
We wanted to make it so convenient that you would ask yourself,...

01:07.165 --> 01:09.097
..."Why wouldn't I take the Karma today?"

01:09.195 --> 01:10.555
It's all in that one case.

01:10.660 --> 01:12.279
It's ready to go, backpack style.

01:12.631 --> 01:15.337
What's great about Karma is that if I bring it and don't use it,...

01:15.473 --> 01:17.900
...it still doesn't get in the way of my experience at all.
