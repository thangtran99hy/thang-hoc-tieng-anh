The space shuttle is one of the most iconic spacecraft ever created.

00:09.940 --> 00:15.412
It stands over 184 feet tall, which is as tall as an 18-story building.

00:16.014 --> 00:20.321
In order to lift all of that weight, the space shuttle has some serious horsepower.

00:20.960 --> 00:25.833
Its two solid rocket boosters create 2.8 million pounds of thrust each...

00:26.209 --> 00:29.149
...and eject exhaust up to 600 feet from the nozzle.

00:29.919 --> 00:31.215
But that's not all it has.

00:31.900 --> 00:35.774
It also has three main engines that are each the size of a car,...

00:36.161 --> 00:39.735
...and create over 500,000 pounds of thrust apiece.

00:40.558 --> 00:42.337
Which makes them very thirsty.

00:43.379 --> 00:49.832
Each engine can drain a 3,200-gallon pool in only nine seconds.

00:50.729 --> 00:55.065
In order to fuel these engines, the shuttle has to carry an external fuel tank...

00:55.166 --> 01:01.667
...that has the capacity of 526,000 gallons or 45 large fuel trailers.

01:02.299 --> 01:03.757
That's a lot of fuel.
