00:00.767 --> 00:04.470
ï»¿I won't just survive.

00:05.332 --> 00:09.109
Oh, you will see me thrive.

00:09.507 --> 00:13.050
Can write my story,...

00:13.582 --> 00:17.341
...I'm beyond the archetype.

00:18.132 --> 00:21.485
I won't just conform,...

00:21.829 --> 00:25.753
...no matter how you shake my core...

00:26.454 --> 00:30.379
...'cause my roots, they run deep.

00:32.275 --> 00:34.158
Oh, ye of so little faith.

00:34.249 --> 00:36.204
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it.

00:36.640 --> 00:38.442
Victory is in my veins.

00:38.531 --> 00:40.362
I know it, I know it.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.556
And I will not negotiate.

00:42.819 --> 00:44.617
I'll fight it, I'll fight it.

00:44.675 --> 00:49.532
I will transform.

00:50.469 --> 00:56.263
When the fire's at my feet again...

00:56.747 --> 01:00.712
...and the vultures all start circling,...

01:01.029 --> 01:08.869
...they're whispering, "You're out of time," but still I rise.

01:09.574 --> 01:13.682
This is no mistake, no accident.

01:13.893 --> 01:20.249
When you think the final nail is in, think again.

01:20.827 --> 01:26.231
Don't be surprised, I will still rise.
