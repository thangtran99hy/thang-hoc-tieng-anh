00:00.127 --> 00:04.627
Stone cold, stone cold,...

00:05.511 --> 00:10.519
...you see me standing but I'm dying on the floor.

00:10.580 --> 00:14.859
Stone cold, stone cold,...

00:15.840 --> 00:20.766
...maybe if I don't cry, I won't feel anymore.

00:20.822 --> 00:22.677
Stone cold,...

00:23.547 --> 00:32.117
...baby, God knows I try to feel happy for you.

00:32.585 --> 00:39.961
Know that I am, even if I can't understand.

00:40.411 --> 00:45.161
I'll take the pain, give me the truth.

00:45.571 --> 00:51.115
Me and my heart, we'll make it through.

00:52.033 --> 01:00.069
If happy is her, I'm happy for you.
