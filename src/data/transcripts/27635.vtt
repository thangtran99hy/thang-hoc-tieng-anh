00:04.048 --> 00:08.727
In every game we play, there comes a point when we face a challenge,...

00:09.538 --> 00:12.534
...a time where we have to dig in and figure it out.

00:13.462 --> 00:16.045
For each one of us, that time is now.

00:17.983 --> 00:19.911
It's time to find ways to talk to each other,...

00:20.299 --> 00:21.155
...listen to each other,...

00:21.599 --> 00:22.507
...learn from each other,...

00:23.348 --> 00:24.291
...respect each other.

00:25.379 --> 00:27.617
It's time to use the game we love as a bridge...

00:28.916 --> 00:32.138
...so we can understand and be understood.

00:34.238 --> 00:35.596
That's what this game does.

00:37.489 --> 00:38.417
It unites us.

00:42.150 --> 00:46.976
It reminds us that no matter where we come from, no matter our differences,...

00:48.095 --> 00:50.700
...there's only one way to work through our challenges:...

00:55.286 --> 00:55.838
...together.
