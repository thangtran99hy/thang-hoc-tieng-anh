ï»¿My dad is Mike.

00:03.299 --> 00:06.667
He works on a drilling rig that pumps oil out from underneath the ocean.

00:07.679 --> 00:08.531
Hey, it's docked.

00:10.479 --> 00:13.505
We're a big company, with millions of moving parts.

00:15.142 --> 00:17.653
Just me or just get real bright in there all of a sudden?

00:20.441 --> 00:21.180
Are you seeing this?

00:21.822 --> 00:23.517
Mike, what is that? Is everything okay?

00:26.749 --> 00:26.943
Mike?

00:27.001 --> 00:27.843
I'll call you back, I'll call you back!

00:33.741 --> 00:35.649
Mayday! Mayday! This is Deepwater Horizon.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.635
We gotta go right now!

00:39.894 --> 00:42.904
All US coastguards en route to Deepwater Horizon.

00:43.827 --> 00:44.598
Everybody, calm down.

00:45.460 --> 00:46.910
We gotta get to the lifeboats right now.

00:47.642 --> 00:48.217
What's wrong?

00:48.304 --> 00:48.990
Not now, baby.

00:49.390 --> 00:49.949
Crank it!

00:50.217 --> 00:51.279
Trust me, you're not going to die.

00:52.107 --> 00:52.435
Let's go!
