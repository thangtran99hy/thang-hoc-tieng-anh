So, how does our relationship with technology affect our relationship with other people?

00:05.814 --> 00:10.501
Last year, a study found that excessive Facebook use is damaging towards relationships,...

00:10.786 --> 00:14.506
...where higher use is correlated with a higher frequency of feelings of jealousy...

00:14.585 --> 00:16.237
...and Facebook-related conflict.

00:16.996 --> 00:19.682
Our use of technology and devices is on the rise...

00:19.761 --> 00:23.589
...and it does change the way couples of all ages communicate, show affection...

00:23.662 --> 00:25.179
...and share special moments.

00:25.566 --> 00:27.488
Is it for better or worse?

00:27.812 --> 00:29.968
And it means different things to different people.

00:30.246 --> 00:34.531
How you use your smartphone depends on your attachment style in relationships.

00:34.933 --> 00:37.779
One study found that a greater use of social network apps...

00:37.853 --> 00:40.701
...was positively associated with intimacy and support...

00:40.783 --> 00:42.962
...for people with higher attachment anxiety.

00:43.216 --> 00:45.364
So, it seems like there's a feedback loop.

00:45.642 --> 00:49.179
People with more attachment anxiety in relationships alleviate this...

00:49.267 --> 00:52.987
...by using their phone to seek more contact and intimacy from their partner,...

00:53.145 --> 00:55.620
...which leads to more of an attachment to their partner...

00:55.709 --> 00:57.820
...and maybe even to their phones themselves.
