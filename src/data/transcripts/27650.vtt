ï»¿Well, I think that trade is an important issue.

00:03.139 --> 00:05.993
Of course, we are 5% of the world's population,...

00:06.115 --> 00:08.207
...we have to trade with the other 95%.

00:08.645 --> 00:11.661
And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.

00:12.155 --> 00:14.655
We also, though, need to have a tax system...

00:14.749 --> 00:18.539
...that rewards work and not just financial transactions.

00:18.956 --> 00:21.671
And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth...

00:22.039 --> 00:24.380
...would be trickle-down economics all over again.

00:24.480 --> 00:27.010
In fact, it would be the most extreme version,...

00:27.099 --> 00:32.121
...the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country...

00:32.206 --> 00:33.017
...that we've ever had.

00:33.413 --> 00:38.193
I call it "Trumped-up, trickle-down" because that's exactly what it would be.

00:38.575 --> 00:41.064
That is not how we grow the economy.

00:41.489 --> 00:45.719
We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy,...

00:45.813 --> 00:50.037
...how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.

00:50.415 --> 00:53.554
I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.

00:54.226 --> 00:55.330
I understand that.

00:55.698 --> 01:01.031
You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit.

01:01.241 --> 01:05.309
He started his business with $14 million borrowed from his father...

01:05.603 --> 01:09.513
...and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people,...

01:09.597 --> 01:12.707
...the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.

01:12.823 --> 01:13.789
I don't buy that.
