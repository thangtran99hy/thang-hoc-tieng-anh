ï»¿Your resume is impressive.

00:02.693 --> 00:02.991
Thank you.

00:03.092 --> 00:04.261
But I have some questions.

00:04.647 --> 00:07.473
If you could be one aquatic mammal, what would it be?

00:07.954 --> 00:09.422
What? A dolphin.

00:09.479 --> 00:11.719
What are your greatest weaknesses? Use song lyrics only.

00:12.936 --> 00:16.130
Five years ago from today, where did you see yourself five years from then?

00:16.186 --> 00:17.192
And don't say here.

00:17.273 --> 00:18.530
Five years ago, I think that I would be...

00:18.591 --> 00:20.609
Wow, this is nonsense.

00:20.831 --> 00:24.583
You gotta ask what you really wanna know and I'm all about being direct.

00:24.715 --> 00:26.479
So, let's get to the point.

00:27.014 --> 00:27.899
Are you responsible?

00:28.049 --> 00:28.318
Yes.

00:28.460 --> 00:29.463
Do you bathe in perfume?

00:29.775 --> 00:31.134
Are you gonna microwave fish in the break room?

00:31.193 --> 00:31.717
People do that?

00:31.852 --> 00:33.026
Do you know how a printer works?

00:33.193 --> 00:33.578
I think so.

00:33.645 --> 00:36.147
She's perfect. Hire her. Don't waste any more of her time.

00:36.578 --> 00:36.999
You're hired.

00:37.085 --> 00:40.091
It's like when people don't use marriott.com to book a Marriott hotel.

00:40.395 --> 00:41.774
That's where you get the best rate.

00:42.211 --> 00:43.255
It pays to book direct.

00:44.163 --> 00:46.177
Will you bring a pack of dogs into the workspace?

00:47.105 --> 00:47.476
No.
