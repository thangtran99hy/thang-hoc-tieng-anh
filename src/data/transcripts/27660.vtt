Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, eBay.

00:03.379 --> 00:06.533
All have either been shut out of China or are barely treading water.

00:07.425 --> 00:08.789
The latest loser is Uber,...

00:09.101 --> 00:13.111
...which sold its Chinese operations after it lost billions of dollars in the country.

00:13.714 --> 00:16.096
Apple has done well but has struggled there recently.

00:16.646 --> 00:19.793
So, why can't American internet companies succeed in China?

00:20.327 --> 00:20.977
Three reasons.

00:21.743 --> 00:25.135
One, China's web titans are unimaginably big and broad,...

00:25.902 --> 00:28.101
...making it tough for foreigners to compete with them.

00:29.015 --> 00:32.540
Alibaba's e-commerce websites handle more online sales...

00:32.768 --> 00:34.432
...than Amazon and eBay combined.

00:34.889 --> 00:37.502
And Baidu has a bigger share of web searches in China...

00:37.770 --> 00:39.437
...than Google does in the US.

00:39.626 --> 00:44.324
Two, China's laws and government interventions favor local companies.

00:45.008 --> 00:47.931
For example, Facebook and Twitter are banned in China.

00:48.260 --> 00:49.919
And Google pulled out a few years ago...

00:50.026 --> 00:52.642
...because it was the target of massive cyberattacks...

00:53.017 --> 00:55.286
...and it didn't want to comply with censorship rules.

00:55.757 --> 00:58.959
And three, Chinese technology has become really good.

00:59.863 --> 01:02.724
Local companies make smartphones as good as iPhones...

01:02.847 --> 01:05.157
...but with features tailored to Chinese tastes...

01:05.348 --> 01:07.249
...like guessing your age from selfies.

01:07.605 --> 01:10.145
And Chinese tech ideas are being copied elsewhere...

01:10.687 --> 01:14.289
...like Facebook turning its chat app Messenger into a version of WeChat.

01:14.887 --> 01:18.233
The might of Chinese internet superpowers, their tech prowess,...

01:18.600 --> 01:22.123
...and government help has hardened China into an online economy...

01:22.246 --> 01:23.221
...where locals rule.

01:23.812 --> 01:25.425
China seems too big to ignore...

01:25.803 --> 01:28.748
...but it's also too hard to crack for America's web powers.
