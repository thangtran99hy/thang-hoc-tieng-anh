I've been called a lot of things from the mouths of 10, and 11 and 12-year-olds.

00:09.840 --> 00:14.623
I also tell them, "Sometimes you're in school longer than you're actually at home."

00:14.874 --> 00:15.013
Yeah.

00:15.101 --> 00:16.365
And I tell them the same thing.

00:16.435 --> 00:19.203
"I spend more time with you than I spend with my own family."

00:26.372 --> 00:27.375
What?

00:28.405 --> 00:29.513
Are you kidding me?

00:30.934 --> 00:32.527
Dear Miss Coy.

00:32.841 --> 00:35.065
I came into fifth grade as a shy girl...

00:35.161 --> 00:37.769
...who especially struggled with talking in front of people.

00:38.051 --> 00:40.157
You took an interest in the things that were important to me,...

00:40.246 --> 00:42.946
...always asked about my family and showed an interest in my love of baseball.

00:43.257 --> 00:47.475
Because of your teaching, you have inspired me to do whatever my passion is when I grow up.

00:47.661 --> 00:51.119
I remember whenever I got stuck on a problem and I thought I just couldn't do it,...

00:51.594 --> 00:55.641
...you said it's not that I couldn't do it, I just couldn't do it yet.

00:55.777 --> 00:59.401
Thank you for making me a better person and thank you for never giving up on me...

00:59.546 --> 01:01.265
....and helping me become the man I am today.
