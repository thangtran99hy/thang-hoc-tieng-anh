Dear Miss Booksy, what's your favorite type of dog?

00:04.853 --> 00:07.365
My favorite type of dog is a beagle.

00:07.866 --> 00:12.502
Beagles have long and floppy ears and they have a super cute little face.

00:13.252 --> 00:16.697
Beagles are known for baying, which is another word for making a sound,...

00:16.854 --> 00:17.915
...kind of like a howl.

00:25.130 --> 00:27.225
Beagles are happy and friendly dogs.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.444
My favorite beagle is Snoopy.

00:29.768 --> 00:33.356
You've probably seen him on TV, like at the Thanksgiving Day parade.

00:33.537 --> 00:36.849
So kids, here are four awesome facts about beagles.

00:39.136 --> 00:39.946
Number one.

00:40.335 --> 00:42.571
The first breed of beagles were miniature.

00:42.862 --> 00:44.717
They were less than nine inches high.

00:45.851 --> 00:50.326
That's right, back in the Roman empire they were just teeny tiny guys.

00:51.630 --> 00:52.351
Number two.

00:52.699 --> 00:55.483
In French, the beagle means "loudmouth".

00:56.369 --> 01:00.049
That's probably because beagles make a loud sound when they bay and howl.

01:00.405 --> 01:02.614
But honestly, I think they sound adorable.

01:03.598 --> 01:04.492
Number three.

01:04.961 --> 01:08.329
They are the fifth most popular dog in the U.S.A.,...

01:08.687 --> 01:12.183
...which means a lot of people love beagles too, just like me.

01:12.768 --> 01:13.233
Number four.

01:13.705 --> 01:16.893
The whole Peanuts gang comes to movie theaters on November 6.

01:17.479 --> 01:20.357
And the Peanuts movie stars my favorite beagle - Snoopy.

01:21.222 --> 01:25.379
I can't wait to see Snoopy and Charlie brown go on awesome adventures.

01:25.644 --> 01:27.874
Thanks for the great question YouTuber Pumpkinpeye.
