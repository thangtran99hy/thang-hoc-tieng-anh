ï»¿Oh my gosh.

00:07.217 --> 00:08.376
Where do I even begin?

00:09.479 --> 00:12.453
From one to ten, my stress level is at about a six.

00:13.037 --> 00:15.663
My stress level today is probably in between a seven and an eight.

00:16.238 --> 00:18.095
All I wanna do is relax.

00:20.279 --> 00:21.565
I just don't know how.

00:25.478 --> 00:27.597
Welcome to this guided meditation.

00:30.473 --> 00:31.147
Are you ready?

00:31.987 --> 00:32.658
Let's begin.

00:34.267 --> 00:35.588
Find a comfortable position.

00:36.979 --> 00:37.937
Close your eyes.

00:38.483 --> 00:39.625
Take a deep breath in,...

00:41.295 --> 00:45.194
...and as you exhale, let your body begin to relax.

00:46.069 --> 00:49.328
Listen to the gentle purring of the happy kitten.

00:50.270 --> 00:50.719
Purr.

00:52.438 --> 00:53.089
Purr.

00:54.879 --> 00:55.721
Purr.

00:57.467 --> 00:59.529
Now, open your eyes.

01:07.664 --> 01:09.717
You can't be stressed after sitting in a box full of kittens.

01:11.391 --> 01:15.255
Being around young creatures just reminds you to take it easy.

01:15.705 --> 01:16.392
It was great!

01:16.701 --> 01:18.953
Unexpected and adorable.

01:19.887 --> 01:20.559
You wanna do it again?

01:20.610 --> 01:20.648
Yeah.

01:21.085 --> 01:21.180
Right now?

01:21.787 --> 01:21.931
Yeah.
