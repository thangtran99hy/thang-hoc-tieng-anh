ï»¿Nearly 70% of people who visited the reef in 2015...

00:03.325 --> 00:06.529
...say they made the trip to Australia to witness its beauty before it's gone.

00:06.778 --> 00:09.951
Almost half of the reef's coral has vanished over the past three decades,...

00:10.032 --> 00:13.733
...thanks to warming ocean temperatures, invasive species and coastal development.

00:13.872 --> 00:17.073
And this year, it suffered the worst coral bleaching in recorded history.

00:17.325 --> 00:20.653
One study estimated over 90% of the reef has been affected.

00:20.836 --> 00:24.575
The Australian government thought the reef's dire state would drive tourists away,...

00:24.679 --> 00:26.331
...but it's done the exact opposite.

00:26.499 --> 00:29.203
That's great news for the multibillion-dollar tourism industry,...

00:29.344 --> 00:31.244
...but it can be bad news for the reef itself.

00:31.369 --> 00:33.687
This phenomenon is called last chance tourism,...

00:33.817 --> 00:35.913
...and it happens all the time at vanishing destinations...

00:36.000 --> 00:38.193
...like the Maldives and Galapagos Islands.
