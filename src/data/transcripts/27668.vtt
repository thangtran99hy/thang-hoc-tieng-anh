ï»¿Hey Jeanie, one more project for you.

00:05.201 --> 00:06.855
It's due Thursday. Is that cool?

00:07.216 --> 00:10.064
Well, Nancy and Ralph might have more time than I do...

00:10.141 --> 00:11.639
...because of this deadline I'm working on.

00:11.787 --> 00:12.530
It will be tough.

00:12.970 --> 00:16.201
Saying no or pushing back on your boss is never easy,...

00:16.425 --> 00:19.175
...but try to avoid rambling in a passive-aggressive way...

00:19.271 --> 00:20.927
...or just blurting out a flat-out no.

00:21.265 --> 00:23.754
Instead, express gratitude for the opportunity,...

00:23.980 --> 00:26.345
...ask your manager what his or her priorities are,...

00:26.512 --> 00:28.505
...and then explain what's already on your plate.

00:28.750 --> 00:31.530
After all, you do want your boss to think of you as the most capable person...

00:31.611 --> 00:33.388
...to come to for any challenging tasks.

00:33.487 --> 00:34.145
That's true.

00:34.745 --> 00:36.152
Thank you for thinking of me for this,...

00:36.236 --> 00:39.160
...but I'm working on a high-priority project that you assigned to me,...

00:39.275 --> 00:42.206
...the Gamma project, and I don't wanna do a rush job on that.

00:42.281 --> 00:46.131
So, can that one be put on the back burner while I work on this new task?

00:46.264 --> 00:47.671
Yeah, you know what, I'll find someone else.

00:47.759 --> 00:48.408
Don't worry about it.

00:48.581 --> 00:49.463
You stay focused.

00:49.634 --> 00:50.212
Thanks.
