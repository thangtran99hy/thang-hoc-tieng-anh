Who are some of America's presidents from history?

00:03.189 --> 00:05.797
Let's start with the very first president, George Washington.

00:06.254 --> 00:09.294
He helped start the USA with his friends over two hundred years ago.

00:09.867 --> 00:11.460
He wore a wig and had wooden teeth.

00:12.799 --> 00:16.321
And he was not nice to his cherry tree but at least he told the truth about it.

00:16.827 --> 00:17.105
Sorry.

00:17.900 --> 00:20.820
Abraham Lincoln was the 16th president of the United States.

00:21.249 --> 00:24.645
He was the tallest president ever and not just because he wore such a big hat.

00:25.340 --> 00:27.101
Here's an awesome fact about Abraham Lincoln.

00:27.862 --> 00:28.555
He was a wrestler.

00:29.057 --> 00:30.509
Maybe that's how he won the election.

00:31.139 --> 00:33.536
I wonder if he had a cool wrestling nickname like "The Rock".

00:34.338 --> 00:35.286
The Lincolnator!

00:36.110 --> 00:37.073
Awesome fact number 2.

00:37.770 --> 00:40.935
Lincoln logs are named after him because he was born in a log cabin.

00:41.629 --> 00:43.664
He was really smart and he kept the country together,...

00:43.865 --> 00:44.816
...which I really appreciate.

00:45.685 --> 00:48.450
Another president who had a toy named after him is Teddy Roosevelt,....

00:48.651 --> 00:49.711
...our 26th president.

00:50.973 --> 00:51.824
The Roosevelt bear?

00:52.189 --> 00:53.322
Oh wait, the teddy bear.

00:53.899 --> 00:56.309
That's kind of cool I'd like a bear named after me, too.

00:57.055 --> 00:59.029
He didn't actually have any bears in the White House.

00:59.452 --> 01:01.565
But Calvin Coolidge had a pet hippopotamus.

01:01.757 --> 01:03.583
And Herbert Hoover had pet alligators.

01:04.297 --> 01:05.884
Some presidents had cool hobbies.

01:06.506 --> 01:08.556
Teddy Roosevelt liked to walk around on stilts.

01:08.978 --> 01:10.637
Maybe he wanted to be taller than Abraham Lincoln.

01:11.322 --> 01:14.289
The 44th president Barack Obama collects comic books.

01:14.745 --> 01:17.136
His favorites are Conan the Barbarian and Spiderman.
