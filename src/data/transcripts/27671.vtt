It turns out that one of the central requirements of a good relationship...

00:04.298 --> 00:07.036
...is a degree of affection for ourselves,...

00:07.519 --> 00:10.329
...built up over the years, largely in childhood.

00:11.052 --> 00:13.815
We need a legacy of being deserving of love...

00:14.269 --> 00:20.259
...in order not to respond very obtusely to the affections granted to us by adult partners.

00:20.881 --> 00:22.819
Without a decent amount of self-love,...

00:23.245 --> 00:27.796
...the love of another person will always prove sickening and misguided...

00:28.267 --> 00:31.567
...and we will self-destructively, though unconsciously,...

00:31.921 --> 00:34.220
...set out to repel or disappoint it.

00:34.915 --> 00:37.849
It will simply feel more normal and therefore comfortable...

00:38.140 --> 00:42.616
...to be disliked or ignored when that is mostly what we have known.

00:43.413 --> 00:46.433
If we are not wholly convinced of our own lovability,...

00:46.760 --> 00:50.722
...receiving affection can appear like being bestowed a prize...

00:51.021 --> 00:54.305
...for an accomplishment we don't feel we ever earned.

00:55.055 --> 00:59.173
People unfortunate enough to fall in love with self-hating types...

00:59.591 --> 01:04.588
...must brace themselves for the recriminations due to false flatterers.
