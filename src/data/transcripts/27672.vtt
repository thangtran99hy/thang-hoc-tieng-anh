00:00.765 --> 00:05.073
We know by instinct that humor is pretty important in relationships...

00:05.611 --> 00:07.935
...but the reasons are often left a little vague.

00:08.571 --> 00:10.961
It isn't that we crudely want entertainment;...

00:11.089 --> 00:12.939
...there are enough comedians on TV.

00:13.578 --> 00:15.281
We don't just want a laugh per se.

00:16.022 --> 00:19.331
For two people to be able to tolerate one another over time,...

00:19.727 --> 00:21.198
...we need to laugh,...

00:21.554 --> 00:25.530
...in the nicest way, at our partner and at ourselves.

00:26.379 --> 00:29.845
Spending time closely around someone inevitably exposes us...

00:29.907 --> 00:34.499
...to constant departures from what we could call normality or balance.

00:34.923 --> 00:40.302
Our partners will be a little crazy in many areas and we will be too, of course.

00:40.901 --> 00:43.381
They might turn out to ring their mother five times a day,...

00:43.779 --> 00:46.706
...clean the kitchen as if surgery was gonna be performed there,...

00:47.143 --> 00:49.247
...always insist on inviting friends around,...

00:49.683 --> 00:52.669
...or want to arrive at the airport six hours before a flight.

00:53.544 --> 00:57.873
We need to say something, but doing so directly and in a serious voice...

00:58.210 --> 01:00.215
...can be painfully counterproductive.

01:00.757 --> 01:05.093
Too often, the partner just feels swiftly attacked and refuses the insight,...

01:05.474 --> 01:08.437
...leading to stifled irritation and bitterness.

01:09.038 --> 01:10.562
This is where humor comes in.

01:11.029 --> 01:14.247
Humor is the most effective way of criticizing another person...

01:14.644 --> 01:17.675
...without arousing their irritation or self-righteousness.

01:18.071 --> 01:19.489
Their laughter isn't just fun.

01:20.093 --> 01:23.783
It's a sign that they have acknowledged an attempt to reform them.
