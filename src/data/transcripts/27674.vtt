00:02.099 --> 00:03.281
ï»¿Welcome to Rome.

00:05.272 --> 00:07.783
Is this a formal event or a social affair?

00:09.141 --> 00:09.667
Social.

00:11.282 --> 00:12.071
How many buttons?

00:12.511 --> 00:12.855
Two.

00:14.349 --> 00:15.126
And what style?

00:17.631 --> 00:18.101
Tactical.

00:23.069 --> 00:23.658
Mister Wick,...

00:24.357 --> 00:25.731
...do enjoy your party.

00:29.633 --> 00:31.380
How good to see you again so soon.

00:37.167 --> 00:40.079
You have no idea what's coming.

00:42.861 --> 00:43.577
You want a war...

00:47.903 --> 00:49.825
...or do you wanna just give me a gun?

01:01.578 --> 01:02.534
Whoever comes,...

01:04.843 --> 01:06.030
...I'll kill them all.

01:08.215 --> 01:08.929
The man,...

01:10.455 --> 01:10.912
...the myth,...

01:11.779 --> 01:12.643
...the legend,...

01:16.765 --> 01:18.235
...John Wick.

01:19.048 --> 01:20.789
You're not very good at retiring.

01:21.269 --> 01:22.235
I'm working on it.
