WEBVTT

00:03.335 --> 00:07.528
We have traveled thousands of miles in search of a weapon...

00:08.139 --> 00:10.245
...more powerful than we've ever known.

00:20.824 --> 00:21.824
Why are you here?

00:22.171 --> 00:23.129
We came to trade.

00:23.843 --> 00:24.441
You lie.

00:25.482 --> 00:26.370
You are thieves!

00:35.941 --> 00:36.603
What was that?

00:36.974 --> 00:38.963
There are many things you have not seen.

00:41.393 --> 00:42.245
The Great Wall...

00:44.734 --> 00:45.747
...is the only barrier...

00:47.481 --> 00:48.857
...keeping the world safe.

00:54.287 --> 00:54.967
Mother of God.

00:57.547 --> 00:58.358
What is it they want?

00:59.637 --> 01:00.104
To feed.
