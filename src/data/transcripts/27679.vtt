You graduated, you got this big debt hanging over you.

00:03.268 --> 00:04.679
You need to work in something.

00:05.299 --> 00:07.391
I guess, I felt a little bit stuck.

00:07.762 --> 00:09.291
There wasn't a lot of options.

00:10.328 --> 00:14.345
I've always been really interested in fashion ever since graduating university.

00:14.441 --> 00:17.077
I have a personal fashion and lifestyle blog.

00:17.375 --> 00:18.965
It's something that I'm really passionate about.

00:19.088 --> 00:22.041
More of a hobby rather than a career goal.

00:22.192 --> 00:25.539
I look for new trends, what's fashionable that season,...

00:25.633 --> 00:28.097
...how other bloggers and influencers are wearing it.

00:28.218 --> 00:30.591
ASOS insiders are a really good source of inspiration.

00:31.043 --> 00:33.505
Once I started blogging and have that outlet,...

00:33.649 --> 00:35.922
...opportunities started to come at me.

00:36.005 --> 00:39.409
And it just opened my eyes to see that actually there is more out there...

00:39.519 --> 00:42.031
...and I could do something I actually enjoyed.

00:42.675 --> 00:46.279
To work for ASOS, like a brand that I love, is just perfect.

00:46.484 --> 00:50.613
When your hobby becomes your work, you're always excited to get in and get going.

00:51.306 --> 00:53.485
It's literally a dream come true to work here.
