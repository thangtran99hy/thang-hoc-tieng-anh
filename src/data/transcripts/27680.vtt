ï»¿Let's learn about lions.

00:06.221 --> 00:11.129
Often called the "king of beasts," lions are unique among the species of the cat family...

00:11.281 --> 00:12.593
...for more than one reason.

00:14.270 --> 00:17.625
Adult male lions are the only cats to have manes.

00:18.747 --> 00:22.320
In addition, lions are the only cats to live in groups.

00:23.181 --> 00:26.227
These close family groups are called prides.

00:27.598 --> 00:30.671
Lions are mammals, which means they are warm-blooded,...

00:30.997 --> 00:33.919
...covered in fur, and they feed their babies milk.

00:35.357 --> 00:39.085
Lions are also carnivores, which means that they eat meat.

00:41.289 --> 00:44.676
Lions are at the top of the food chain in the habitats where they live.

00:45.717 --> 00:47.649
Although they are apex predators,...

00:47.829 --> 00:51.928
...meaning that aside from humans, no other animals prey on lions,...

00:52.376 --> 00:54.679
...lions are also scavengers.

00:55.891 --> 00:58.658
They get about half of their food by scavenging,...

00:59.031 --> 01:01.953
...and will eat both animals that have died naturally...

01:02.330 --> 01:07.543
...and kills they can steal from other predators like leopards, cheetahs, and hyenas.
