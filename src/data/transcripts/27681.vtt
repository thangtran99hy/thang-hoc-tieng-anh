ï»¿Let's learn about Giraffes!

00:04.167 --> 00:10.279
With long, long necks, and long legs, giraffes are the tallest living land animals.

00:10.937 --> 00:14.912
Some giraffes reach a height of more than 17 feet.

00:15.742 --> 00:19.381
They're mammals, which means they are warm-blooded,...

00:19.487 --> 00:22.781
...they have fur, and they feed their babies milk.

00:25.404 --> 00:29.131
Giraffes live in Africa, south of the Sahara Desert.

00:29.929 --> 00:32.758
They prefer to live in open woodland or grassland,...

00:32.941 --> 00:36.699
...where they eat the leaves from trees that other animals can't reach.

00:38.261 --> 00:41.422
Giraffes are herbivores or plant-eaters.

00:41.733 --> 00:43.867
They can eat leaves from acacia trees...

00:44.022 --> 00:48.846
...because their long tongues and tough lips let them eat around the thorns.

00:51.311 --> 00:54.057
Lions will sometimes kill and eat giraffes,...

00:54.296 --> 00:57.672
...but usually the giraffes' long necks lets them see trouble coming...

00:57.753 --> 01:00.707
...and they just run away before the lions can catch them.

01:01.753 --> 01:03.853
That's why giraffes travel in herds.

01:04.117 --> 01:06.606
There's always someone watching for trouble.

01:07.327 --> 01:11.519
To stay safe, giraffes stay standing up almost all of the time.

01:11.925 --> 01:14.871
They eat standing up, they sleep standing up...

01:15.127 --> 01:17.864
...they even have their babies while they're standing up.
