ï»¿Amsterdam has this infamous reputation around the world...

00:05.073 --> 00:08.035
...for being a little quirky and a little bit edgy,...

00:08.137 --> 00:10.362
...and it definitely lives up to all of that.

00:10.577 --> 00:11.983
That's what gives it its charm.

00:12.433 --> 00:14.935
This is an absolutely beautiful city...

00:15.183 --> 00:18.106
...and it's even better when you see it on the seat of a bike,...

00:18.343 --> 00:21.359
...nice and slow so you can check out everything.

00:27.373 --> 00:30.117
I love this boat, it's just covered with windows.

00:30.205 --> 00:31.255
You can see all around you.

00:31.347 --> 00:34.013
All through the canals, the sun is starting to set.

00:34.113 --> 00:36.337
The buildings look absolutely beautiful.

00:36.620 --> 00:40.279
And I now understand why they're calling this a romantic dinner cruise.

00:42.435 --> 00:43.895
This place is huge.

00:43.977 --> 00:48.509
There's over 80 acres of flowers here and over 2,000 varieties of tulips.

00:49.247 --> 00:52.263
And right now we're here at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam,...

00:52.735 --> 00:55.377
...and we're looking at over 200 pieces of artwork...

00:55.497 --> 00:56.957
...that he has done over his lifetime.
