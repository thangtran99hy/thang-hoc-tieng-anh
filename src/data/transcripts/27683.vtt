00:03.967 --> 00:10.347
There's a calm surrender to the rush of day,...

00:11.354 --> 00:17.869
...when the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away.

00:18.969 --> 00:25.251
An enchanted moment and it sees me through.

00:26.453 --> 00:32.823
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you.

00:33.742 --> 00:40.257
And can you feel the love tonight?

00:42.779 --> 00:45.763
It is where we are.

00:49.709 --> 01:00.701
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer that we got this far.

01:03.879 --> 01:10.313
Can you feel the love tonight,...

01:12.791 --> 01:16.037
...how it's laid to rest?

01:19.669 --> 01:30.739
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best.
