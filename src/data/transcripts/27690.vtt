Hey Rick, I'm taking lunch orders. What can I get you?

00:06.149 --> 00:10.403
I'll take a buffalo chicken sandwich with lettuce, tomato, a little bit of mayo...

00:11.389 --> 00:14.806
...and if they don't have that, I'll just take six waters.

00:15.261 --> 00:15.840
No problem!

00:16.825 --> 00:18.032
What can I get you for lunch?

00:19.179 --> 00:21.383
Would I be bad if I ordered pad thai?

00:22.529 --> 00:23.649
Yes.

00:23.826 --> 00:25.608
Oh okay, I'll get a Greek salad.

00:26.458 --> 00:27.088
Got it.

00:27.642 --> 00:33.614
One, two, three, four. Could you hold on one second, please?

00:34.011 --> 00:36.564
Sorry to interrupt, do you want to order something for lunch?

00:36.705 --> 00:43.936
Oh yeah, can I get a spinach wrap with tomato, avocado, corn and onions,...

00:44.433 --> 00:49.027
...and then could you throw it in the garbage because I would never eat that?

00:49.277 --> 00:50.124
Thank you so much.

00:50.231 --> 00:50.772
Sure thing.

00:51.251 --> 00:52.114
Sorry about that.

00:52.748 --> 00:57.589
Five, six, and then seven, eight.

00:59.487 --> 01:01.059
Boss, what would you like for lunch?

01:03.868 --> 01:04.889
You know what, surprise me.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.126
Okeydokey.

01:07.049 --> 01:09.723
And for lunch, I'll get a General Tso chicken please.
