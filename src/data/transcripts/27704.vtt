00:00.871 --> 00:01.689
ï»¿This is Ashley.

00:02.516 --> 00:03.313
She's going on a trip,...

00:04.297 --> 00:06.041
...a trip she started planning awhile back,...

00:06.517 --> 00:09.558
...but right now feels kinda rushed.

00:11.262 --> 00:12.299
Eleven hours later,...

00:13.849 --> 00:15.076
...this isn't her hotel.

00:15.933 --> 00:17.613
And with no Wi-Fi and no data,...

00:20.033 --> 00:23.758
...she's okay because Ashley already downloaded Google Trips.

00:24.899 --> 00:28.683
She has everything she needs to know about her vacation right here on her phone,...

00:29.434 --> 00:31.178
...including how to find her hotel.

00:31.695 --> 00:35.743
And now that she's here, working out what to do doesn't need to be quite so...

00:37.607 --> 00:38.327
...overwhelming.

00:41.259 --> 00:42.605
Because with Google Trips,...

00:42.899 --> 00:46.153
...Ashley can make her own personalized itinerary for each day...

00:48.429 --> 00:51.821
...with all her must-see spots laid out on a map to help get her there.
