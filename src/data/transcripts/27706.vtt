00:00.050 --> 00:05.227
Ironically working in my laboratory, the nuclear weapon is finally complete.

00:05.497 --> 00:09.286
After it had been working good in my laboratory for hours.

00:09.560 --> 00:12.773
I am literally tickled thinking about it.

00:16.182 --> 00:16.911
Who's there?

00:18.972 --> 00:20.077
Captain Literally.

00:20.167 --> 00:20.955
Captain Irony.

00:21.099 --> 00:21.971
Nuclear Ninja.

00:22.086 --> 00:23.709
The Good and the Well Duo.

00:23.859 --> 00:25.652
And Dangling Participle Dude.

00:25.767 --> 00:27.282
Everything was wrong with that sentence.

00:27.387 --> 00:28.826
So wait, who are you?

00:28.981 --> 00:30.463
Dangling Participle Dude.

00:30.665 --> 00:33.200
Everyone's heard of him, but no one actually knows what he does.

00:35.497 --> 00:38.503
Whatever. You broke all the rules, so now you're gonna pay.

00:38.921 --> 00:41.019
There was nothing ironic about the sentence you just used.

00:41.115 --> 00:42.951
You just tacked the word ironically in front of it.

00:43.115 --> 00:43.997
Irony taught!

00:44.913 --> 00:47.167
You said good when you should have said well.

00:47.703 --> 00:48.833
Good and well are different!

00:53.253 --> 00:55.021
There, literally tickled.

00:55.311 --> 00:56.588
Balance restored!

00:56.960 --> 01:01.244
Bro, your participles were dangling all over the place.

01:01.987 --> 01:03.819
Dangle shmangle.
