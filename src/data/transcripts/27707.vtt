ï»¿First, just like with our other drawings,...

00:03.091 --> 00:07.437
...we're gonna do a quick sketch of the body as an outline for us on the page.

00:09.547 --> 00:13.058
Next, draw the front of Little Red Riding Hood's face.

00:14.740 --> 00:16.423
And then, add her hair...

00:21.507 --> 00:22.482
...and her hood.

00:27.692 --> 00:43.382
Now, finish her body by adding clothes, legs and arms.

00:54.233 --> 00:57.465
And of course, don't forget the long cape she's famous for.

00:59.332 --> 01:03.968
Finally, give her a nose, eyes...

01:13.593 --> 01:14.719
...and a mouth.

01:16.987 --> 01:19.413
And then color her in however you like.

01:21.209 --> 01:23.821
Here's what Junaid's looks like all colored in.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.125
And here's what mine looks like.
