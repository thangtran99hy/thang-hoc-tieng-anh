00:06.581 --> 00:10.504
Oh life, it's bigger,...

00:12.004 --> 00:15.712
...bigger than you and you are not me.

00:16.585 --> 00:19.075
The lengths that I will go to,...

00:19.945 --> 00:22.461
...the distance in your eyes.

00:25.527 --> 00:29.694
Oh no, I've said too much.

00:30.748 --> 00:32.506
I set it up.

00:33.649 --> 00:35.698
That's me in the corner.

00:37.135 --> 00:39.849
That's me in the spotlight,...

00:40.205 --> 00:42.586
...losing my religion,...

00:43.850 --> 00:47.170
...trying to keep up with you.

00:47.894 --> 00:50.876
And I don't know if I can do it.

00:52.261 --> 00:56.360
Oh no, I've said too much.

00:56.670 --> 00:59.133
I haven't said enough.

00:59.941 --> 01:02.455
I thought that I heard you laughing.

01:03.376 --> 01:05.707
I thought that I heard you sing.

01:07.684 --> 01:12.154
I think I thought I saw you try.
