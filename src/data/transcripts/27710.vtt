00:02.525 --> 00:03.527
ï»¿What is your mission?

00:03.676 --> 00:04.705
To stop the war.

00:04.870 --> 00:05.792
What war?

00:06.001 --> 00:07.871
The war to end all wars.

00:09.968 --> 00:12.704
Weapons far deadlier than you can ever imagine.

00:13.858 --> 00:15.211
The world can be ours.

00:17.188 --> 00:20.103
Wherever you are, you are in more danger than you think.

00:20.195 --> 00:22.895
I cannot stand by while innocent lives are lost.

00:26.033 --> 00:27.147
Be careful, Diana.

00:28.688 --> 00:29.536
Who's this woman?

00:29.679 --> 00:31.963
She's my secretary, sir.

00:34.928 --> 00:36.223
She's a very good secretary.

00:40.381 --> 00:42.942
It is our sacred duty to defend the world,...

00:43.126 --> 00:44.551
...and it's what I'm going to do.
