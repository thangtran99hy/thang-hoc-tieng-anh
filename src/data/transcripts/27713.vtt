Blakely has the most difficult job in Cincinnati Zoo.

00:03.670 --> 00:05.495
He has to play with babies all the time.

00:08.276 --> 00:10.726
He's never shown any aggression or snapped.

00:11.144 --> 00:15.207
If he gets upset, kinda like any mom would, he just leaves the room.

00:16.826 --> 00:18.422
You are so cute!

00:19.663 --> 00:22.868
My name is Dawn Strasser and we're at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Gardens.

00:23.727 --> 00:27.650
Blakely is a five-year-old Australian Shepherd, we got him from a rescue.

00:28.049 --> 00:31.363
And I use him in the nursery as a nanny or companion dog.

00:31.836 --> 00:33.612
This is about you and you're taking a nap!

00:34.293 --> 00:37.705
Blakely's here for the main purpose of teaching the babies...

00:37.795 --> 00:39.705
...the correct animal cues as they grow up.

00:39.843 --> 00:42.719
So, when they are introduced back to their own kind,...

00:42.857 --> 00:44.629
...they know what appropriate behavior is.

00:45.063 --> 00:47.096
He teaches them how to play, how to interact.

00:47.701 --> 00:51.431
I can tell them, "No, don't bite me," but I'm not an animal...

00:51.709 --> 00:54.958
...and I don't give the same cues that he can.

00:55.713 --> 00:56.932
So, we make a great team.
