Ninety-nine percent of the world is convinced they can't do great things,...

00:04.249 --> 00:05.297
...so they shoot for the middle.

00:05.760 --> 00:07.391
They shoot for realistic goals,...

00:07.896 --> 00:11.235
...which means that realistic goals are the most competitive place to be.

00:12.121 --> 00:17.789
Therefore, unrealistic goals are less competitive because no one's going for them.

00:19.701 --> 00:23.986
So, don't overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself.

00:24.349 --> 00:25.889
You're probably better than you think.

00:27.841 --> 00:30.259
There's this great quote from "Into the Wild", the film.

00:30.374 --> 00:32.109
It's, "Happiness is only real when it's shared."

00:32.790 --> 00:33.833
And we really believe that,...

00:34.341 --> 00:37.163
...and when I think back about the adventures in the past nine years...

00:37.259 --> 00:39.593
...and the things that we've done, it's the things that we've done for other people...

00:40.070 --> 00:42.621
...that I know will stick with me until I die.

00:43.325 --> 00:45.158
So, the thing I want to leave you guys with is,...

00:45.311 --> 00:46.959
...what do you want to do before you die?

00:47.513 --> 00:47.842
Thank you.
