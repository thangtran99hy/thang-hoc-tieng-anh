00:00.050 --> 00:00.820
Mother's wedding ring.

00:00.987 --> 00:03.071
I lost mine in the bombing so my mother gave me hers.

00:03.145 --> 00:03.833
My earrings.

00:03.913 --> 00:04.743
I make jewelry,...

00:04.921 --> 00:06.310
...all the jewelry of my people.

00:06.551 --> 00:07.791
It symbolizes freedom.

00:08.142 --> 00:09.383
No one tells me what to wear.

00:09.501 --> 00:10.125
Heart necklace.

00:10.209 --> 00:10.769
Heart necklace.

00:10.837 --> 00:12.105

Bracelet.

00:12.760 --> 00:13.065
Bracelet.

00:13.151 --> 00:13.457
Bracelet.

00:13.537 --> 00:15.740
No, the bracelet's not my favorite thing.

00:16.085 --> 00:17.617
That's Nancy, she's my doll.

00:18.071 --> 00:21.122
The night we fled, my mother put her on my bed so we would not forget her.

00:21.278 --> 00:23.489
But in all the rush, she did get left behind.

00:23.593 --> 00:25.461
I don't mind, she'll keep watch.

00:25.571 --> 00:25.941
Watch.

00:26.010 --> 00:26.456
Digital...

00:26.613 --> 00:27.227
...and analog.

00:27.339 --> 00:28.256
Family portrait.

00:28.634 --> 00:29.153

00:29.293 --> 00:29.817
Photos.

00:30.345 --> 00:31.417
A photo of my father,...

00:32.179 --> 00:33.445
...memories of my father.

00:33.537 --> 00:34.835
I have nothing from my home.

00:35.343 --> 00:36.919
Everything was broken in the struggle.

00:38.107 --> 00:39.904
We were out in just ten minutes.

00:42.967 --> 00:45.165
They destroyed the house around my sick bed.

00:46.029 --> 00:49.283
The neighbors heard me shout and came and carried me out.
