00:00.768 --> 00:02.691
ï»¿Well, Walmart is making big commitments...

00:02.774 --> 00:05.696
...to places like 1888 Mills in Griffin, Georgia...

00:06.295 --> 00:08.071
...who make the finest towels around.

00:08.993 --> 00:11.086
You see, towels are made from cotton.

00:11.352 --> 00:13.872
And cotton is grown right here in the US.

00:14.133 --> 00:16.499
It's just good business to manufacture the towels...

00:16.579 --> 00:17.905
...near where you grow the cotton.

00:18.229 --> 00:21.911
Walmart's commitment allowed 1888 Mills to raise the capital...

00:21.989 --> 00:26.988
...to invest in more equipment, capacity, and of course, more workers,...

00:27.487 --> 00:30.905
...which made making towels here in America good for business.

00:31.496 --> 00:34.975
Now multiply that times the hundreds of US factories working with Walmart.

00:35.232 --> 00:38.128
That could mean up to 1 million new manufacturing and service jobs...

00:38.221 --> 00:40.896
...in communities across the country over the next ten years.

00:41.079 --> 00:42.282
That's a lot of jobs,...

00:42.494 --> 00:47.180
...which means more people have more money to spend on products that support American jobs...

00:47.324 --> 00:49.633
At places like, well, Walmart...

00:49.973 --> 00:53.855
...that demand for those products means more work for American factories.

00:53.986 --> 00:59.292
And all of a sudden, you've got yourself some real job creation and real economic growth.
