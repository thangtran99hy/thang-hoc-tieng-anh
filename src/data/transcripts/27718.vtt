Ashley Bryant you are a teacher of small children.

00:03.744 --> 00:04.175
That's right.

00:04.420 --> 00:06.918
I have read it is the hardest job in the world.

00:06.994 --> 00:08.132
That's why I'm here, can you...

00:08.188 --> 00:11.759
I can offer advice from the accumulated knowledge of other educators.

00:11.839 --> 00:13.223
That's wonderful but I...

00:13.279 --> 00:15.302
I can tailor a curriculum for each student...

00:15.423 --> 00:18.219
...by cross-referencing aptitude, development, geography...

00:18.287 --> 00:20.847
Sorry to interrupt but I just have one question.

00:21.405 --> 00:22.332
How do I keep them quiet?

00:25.037 --> 00:25.405
Watson?

00:26.792 --> 00:28.399
There is no known solution.
