Financials are looking great.

00:01.566 --> 00:03.193
Paul, do you have any comments on staffing?

00:03.373 --> 00:07.795
I was thinking about that because we get a few more contractor types in...

00:08.873 --> 00:09.659
Hold on, I'm sorry.

00:10.139 --> 00:10.513
Rex!

00:10.660 --> 00:11.259
Get down!

00:18.100 --> 00:22.435
Well, to me, staffing is a huge impact.

00:23.012 --> 00:23.305
Is that me?

00:23.372 --> 00:23.888
That's not me at all.

00:24.725 --> 00:29.451
I just want to go over a couple of details as we move into our next section here.

00:30.749 --> 00:32.322
We got three new departments coming on...

00:32.768 --> 00:33.885
Breaking up a little bit, guys.

00:35.219 --> 00:36.231
Driving through a dead spot.

00:38.867 --> 00:39.495
Sorry, guys.

00:40.149 --> 00:40.910
That's it, guys.

00:41.046 --> 00:42.700
Beth, you'll send out a recap email...

00:42.849 --> 00:45.404
...that could've basically taken the place of this whole meeting, correct?

00:45.661 --> 00:46.511
Yup, always do.

00:46.687 --> 00:47.545
Yeah thanks for doing that, Beth.

00:48.421 --> 00:48.861
Dave!

00:49.390 --> 00:50.187
You've been here the whole time?

00:50.543 --> 00:50.811
Yeah.

00:52.896 --> 00:54.000
Well, thanks everyone once again.

00:54.720 --> 00:55.476
Oh, one more...
