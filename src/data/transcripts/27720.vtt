Now, it's time for America to bind the wounds of division, have to get together.

00:08.562 --> 00:12.931
To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation,...

00:13.891 --> 00:20.345
...I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.

00:23.329 --> 00:23.613
It's time.

00:28.095 --> 00:34.273
I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be President for all Americans...

00:34.839 --> 00:37.341
...and this is so important to me.

00:42.506 --> 00:46.324
For those who have chosen not to support me in the past,...

00:46.412 --> 00:48.002
...of which there were a few people,...

00:50.129 --> 00:53.601
...I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help...

00:54.399 --> 00:58.776
...so that we can work together and unify our great country.

00:59.855 --> 01:04.729
As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign...

01:05.586 --> 01:09.619
...but rather an incredible and great movement,...

01:10.379 --> 01:16.316
...made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country...

01:16.747 --> 01:20.963
...and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family.

01:24.736 --> 01:28.305
It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races,...

01:28.663 --> 01:30.864
...religions, backgrounds and beliefs,...

01:31.124 --> 01:34.947
...who want and expect our government to serve the people...

01:35.401 --> 01:38.011
...and serve the people, it will.

01:43.244 --> 01:48.637
Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation...

01:49.131 --> 01:51.510
...and renewing the "American Dream".

01:53.126 --> 01:55.869
I've spent my entire life in business,...

01:56.470 --> 02:01.333
...looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world.

02:02.567 --> 02:06.143
That is now what I want to do for our country.
