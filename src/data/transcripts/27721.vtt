Success is failing over and over again without losing enthusiasm.

00:12.489 --> 00:14.125
I pretty much believe in that.

00:18.043 --> 00:23.995
To me, practice is purposeful, intentional iterations of failure.

00:27.587 --> 00:33.937
You need those moments of struggle in order to come back up,...

00:34.726 --> 00:37.382
...realizing that, "Hey, if I come out of this, I'm actually stronger."

00:37.842 --> 00:38.657
That's motivating.

00:41.622 --> 00:44.565
The things that have motivated me every day have changed over the years.

00:45.353 --> 00:48.518
Before, it was getting the medals or getting the records.

00:49.331 --> 00:54.850
And now, it's almost like there's this intangible something that's bigger than me.

00:58.687 --> 01:00.642
Something that inspires me the most...

01:01.215 --> 01:04.481
...is people who do something that's never been done.

01:04.893 --> 01:09.992
And every attempt, every day, it's part of my pursuit.

01:15.297 --> 01:17.685
How good can I be?
