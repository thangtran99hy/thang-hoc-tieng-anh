00:01.437 --> 00:04.129
Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump...

00:04.238 --> 00:07.469
...and offered to work with him on behalf of our country.

00:08.246 --> 00:13.583
I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans.

00:14.485 --> 00:18.781
This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for...

00:19.304 --> 00:22.758
...and I'm sorry that we did not win this election...

00:23.007 --> 00:26.859
...for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country.

00:27.465 --> 00:36.084
But I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together,...

00:36.573 --> 00:42.839
...this vast, diverse, creative, unruly, energized campaign.

00:43.464 --> 00:46.046
You represent the best of America...

00:46.194 --> 00:50.293
...and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life.

00:54.865 --> 00:58.716
This is painful, and it will be for a long time,...

00:59.388 --> 01:01.072
...but I want you to remember this:...

01:01.719 --> 01:06.902
...our campaign was never about one person or even one election.

01:07.690 --> 01:09.807
It was about the country we love...

01:09.996 --> 01:15.766
...and about building an America that's hopeful, inclusive and big-hearted.

01:16.500 --> 01:21.744
We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought,...

01:22.462 --> 01:26.127
...but I still believe in America and I always will.

01:28.041 --> 01:35.513
Finally, I am so grateful for our country and for all it has given to me.

01:36.331 --> 01:41.483
I count my blessings every single day that I am an American...

01:42.117 --> 01:46.618
...and I still believe, as deeply as I ever have,...

01:47.081 --> 01:52.170
...that if we stand together and work together with respect for our differences,...

01:52.337 --> 01:56.560
...strength in our convictions and love for this nation,...

01:57.225 --> 02:00.457
...our best days are still ahead of us.
