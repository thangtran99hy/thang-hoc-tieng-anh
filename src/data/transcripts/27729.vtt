00:01.656 --> 00:02.717
So, what is empathy...

00:03.307 --> 00:05.831
...and why is it very different than sympathy?

00:06.857 --> 00:09.027
Empathy fuels connection.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.671
Sympathy drives disconnection.

00:12.534 --> 00:15.062
Empathy is a choice and it's a vulnerable choice...

00:15.148 --> 00:16.820
...because in order to connect with you,...

00:17.295 --> 00:21.376
...I have to connect with something in myself that knows that feeling.

00:22.419 --> 00:27.043
Rarely, if ever, does an empathic response begin with "at least".

00:29.271 --> 00:33.221
Yeah and we do it all the time because, you know what?

00:33.508 --> 00:36.492
Someone just shared something with us that's incredibly painful...

00:37.188 --> 00:38.828
...and we're trying to "silver lining" it.

00:39.142 --> 00:41.691
I don't think that's a verb, but I'm using it as one.

00:42.683 --> 00:44.185
We're trying to put a silver lining around it.

00:44.289 --> 00:46.275
"So, I had a miscarriage."

00:47.489 --> 00:48.813
"At least you know you can get pregnant."

00:49.240 --> 00:50.686
"I think my marriage is falling apart."

00:51.366 --> 00:52.960
"At least you have a marriage."

00:57.301 --> 00:58.775
"John's getting kicked out of school."

00:59.215 --> 01:00.959
"At least Sarah is an A student."

01:01.443 --> 01:03.381
But one of the things we do sometimes,...

01:03.463 --> 01:09.879
...in the face of very difficult conversations, is we try to make things better.

01:10.559 --> 01:13.867
If I share something with you that's very difficult, I'd rather you say,...

01:15.329 --> 01:17.653
..."I don't even know what to say right now, I'm just so glad you told me."

01:19.483 --> 01:23.618
Because the truth is, rarely can a response make something better.

01:24.151 --> 01:26.143
What makes something better is connection.
