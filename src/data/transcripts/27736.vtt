ï»¿Which is the hardest word to translate in this sentence?

00:13.515 --> 00:15.132
"Know" is easy to translate.

00:15.496 --> 00:19.555
"Pep rally" doesn't have a direct analog in a lot of languages and cultures,...

00:19.857 --> 00:21.159
...but can be approximated.

00:21.659 --> 00:25.806
But the hardest word there is actually one of the smallest: "you."

00:26.487 --> 00:30.956
As simple as it seems, it's often impossible to accurately translate "you"...

00:31.185 --> 00:34.803
...without knowing a lot more about the situation where it's being said.

00:35.811 --> 00:40.029
To start with, how familiar are you with the person you're talking to?

00:40.550 --> 00:43.525
Many cultures have different levels of formality.

00:43.992 --> 00:48.827
A close friend, someone much older or much younger, a stranger, a boss:...

00:49.107 --> 00:51.838
...these all may be slightly different yous.

00:52.890 --> 00:56.009
In many languages, the pronoun reflects these differences...

00:56.107 --> 00:59.150
...through what's known as the "TV distinction."

00:59.873 --> 01:04.205
In French for example, you would say "tu" when talking to your friend at school,...

01:04.730 --> 01:06.635
...but "vous" when addressing your teacher.

01:07.329 --> 01:09.357
Even English once had something similar.

01:09.789 --> 01:11.611
Remember the old-timey "thou?"

01:12.202 --> 01:16.461
Ironically, it was actually the informal pronoun for people you're close with...

01:16.736 --> 01:19.514
...while "you" was the formal and polite version.

01:20.173 --> 01:24.131
That distinction was lost when the English decided to just be polite all the time.
