00:01.518 --> 00:04.545
I've heard there was a secret chord,...

00:04.854 --> 00:08.048
...that David played, and it pleased the Lord.

00:08.155 --> 00:12.233
But you don't really care for music, do you?

00:14.909 --> 00:18.137
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth.

00:18.273 --> 00:21.399
The minor fall and the major lift.

00:21.709 --> 00:26.962
The baffled king composing Hallelujah.

00:28.372 --> 00:30.574
Hallelujah.

00:31.973 --> 00:34.037
Hallelujah.

00:35.348 --> 00:37.733
Hallelujah.

00:38.781 --> 00:43.271
Hallelujah.

00:49.209 --> 00:52.051
Your faith was strong but you needed proof.

00:52.721 --> 00:55.531
You saw her bathing on the roof.

00:56.023 --> 01:00.476
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you.

01:02.693 --> 01:05.937
She tied you to her kitchen chair.

01:06.141 --> 01:09.195
She broke your throne and she cut your hair.

01:09.589 --> 01:14.807
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah.

01:16.207 --> 01:18.447
Hallelujah.

01:19.670 --> 01:21.849
Hallelujah.

01:23.117 --> 01:25.665
Hallelujah.

01:26.525 --> 01:31.085
Hallelujah.
