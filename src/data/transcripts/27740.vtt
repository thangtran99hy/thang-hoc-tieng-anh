00:08.131 --> 00:10.701
I learned about other dancers and companies kind of on my own...

00:10.849 --> 00:14.409
...once I started to develop into a ballet dancer.

00:14.707 --> 00:18.310
But New York and ABT just always seemed like the ultimate.

00:19.236 --> 00:23.259
I was like a child and it's crazy to like, think back on that.

00:24.861 --> 00:27.560
I had no idea what to do, I didn't know how to take care of myself...

00:27.661 --> 00:29.490
...and be on my own and travel alone.

00:30.351 --> 00:31.874
It was a lot.

00:31.994 --> 00:35.877
I was really emotional like, overwhelmed and I was already such a nervous girl.

00:37.233 --> 00:40.001
Misty and I were the two out of the studio company...

00:40.086 --> 00:44.287
...who were sent to go with the main company to China.

00:44.535 --> 00:47.934
So, right away, we clicked and we got along and we were rooming together...

00:48.495 --> 00:50.008
...and we became the best of friends.

00:50.585 --> 00:52.649
We were both really young and naive,...

00:52.748 --> 00:55.116
...and we'd never been in a professional company before.

00:55.275 --> 01:01.181
And the company was a bunch of adults that had lived life and were married...

01:01.261 --> 01:03.002
...and had been in the company for years.

01:03.075 --> 01:05.770
They wouldn't help us if we asked them for help with choreography,...

01:05.837 --> 01:08.915
..or they would say things to us during class while we were doing things.

01:09.025 --> 01:12.155
If we messed up a turn, they'd be like, "Oh, better luck next time."

01:13.951 --> 01:16.110
When you're in your adolescence and you're dancing,...

01:16.293 --> 01:19.350
...you don't get to experience what normal kids get to experience.

01:19.508 --> 01:23.108
You don't date, you don't go to parties, you don't hang out.

01:23.383 --> 01:27.268
As soon as school's over, you're going straight to practice and to dance class.
