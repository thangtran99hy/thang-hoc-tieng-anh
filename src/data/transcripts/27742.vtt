00:03.353 --> 00:04.705
First, how to chop an onion.

00:05.169 --> 00:05.845
This is the root.

00:06.205 --> 00:08.005
That's absolute crucial, leave that on there.

00:08.086 --> 00:11.641
If you cut that off, the onion will start to bleed and you'll start crying rapidly.

00:12.279 --> 00:13.549
Slice going forward.

00:13.769 --> 00:15.526
Let the weight of the knife do the work.

00:16.462 --> 00:19.055
Three fingers, one in front, two behind...

00:19.211 --> 00:22.011
...and this, part of the knuckle, is gonna guide the knife.

00:22.449 --> 00:23.150
Fingers on top of the onion,...

00:23.383 --> 00:28.555
...point the knife towards the root and try to get as close to the root as possible,...

00:29.131 --> 00:32.072
...nice, long strokes.

00:34.104 --> 00:35.694
And then, push the onion back together,...

00:36.333 --> 00:38.804
...push the knife halfway in to the onion,...

00:39.170 --> 00:41.686
...slightly tilt the knife down, one at the top,...

00:43.175 --> 00:46.657
...and then, gripping the onion like a tennis ball, holding it together in place,...

00:50.618 --> 00:53.167
...with the weight of the blade to cut through that onion...

00:53.625 --> 00:54.847
...to get to the base of the root.

00:56.825 --> 00:59.191
Again, turn it around, up and down motion.

01:01.271 --> 01:03.825
And that's what we're left there: no waste, just the root.

01:04.504 --> 01:09.213
And look, there, you've got a really nice, finely-chopped onion.
