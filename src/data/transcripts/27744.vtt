00:00.761 --> 00:02.338
ï»¿I've never tried uni before.

00:02.409 --> 00:03.720
I love sushi, I've never had that.

00:03.881 --> 00:08.027
My only experience with sea urchins is like, "Finding Nemo" and Freddi the fish.

00:08.172 --> 00:09.569
My dad loves sushi...

00:09.660 --> 00:12.847
...and he says that sea urchin is the worst thing he's ever eaten.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.796
It's not what I imagined.

00:18.489 --> 00:19.388
It looks like a tongue.

00:19.616 --> 00:20.924
It looks like a brain.

00:21.006 --> 00:21.509
It feels like a slug.

00:21.771 --> 00:22.933
It's just like, dripping.

00:23.050 --> 00:24.867
Okay, always wanted to try it, I'm gonna do it.

00:29.258 --> 00:30.315
Got some sand in there.

00:34.205 --> 00:35.113
It's actually not that bad.

00:36.389 --> 00:37.156
What was that?

00:37.231 --> 00:39.040
What's the big deal about it, like, it was fine.

00:39.119 --> 00:41.777
It tastes like a combination between the ocean and shoe leather.

00:41.909 --> 00:46.389
That like, intense sea taste made my stomach turn.
