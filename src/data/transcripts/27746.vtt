00:00.229 --> 00:01.711
ï»¿No, don't go on a second date with him.

00:01.993 --> 00:02.978
He sounds like a jerk.

00:03.323 --> 00:07.008
He also dated Kimmy's ex, so you don't even want to be anywhere near that.

00:07.222 --> 00:08.865
I mean, I'm at work but I'm not...

00:08.934 --> 00:10.651
As anyone who works in a cubicle knows...

00:10.728 --> 00:14.053
...sitting next to someone who yaps all day can make it really hard to focus.

00:14.919 --> 00:15.874
What a jerk!

00:16.061 --> 00:17.026
Okay, seriously.

00:17.103 --> 00:17.418
Okay.

00:17.784 --> 00:19.439
You can skip the noise-cancelling headphones.

00:19.795 --> 00:22.326
They only work on ambient sounds like the hum of a plane engine.

00:22.687 --> 00:25.446
Instead, you can use regular headphones and go to myNoise.net.

00:26.671 --> 00:30.107
There, you can choose from a variety of distraction-busting sounds...

00:30.228 --> 00:31.820
...like ocean waves or bird song.

00:32.288 --> 00:33.658
I like babble noise.

00:34.143 --> 00:37.928
Turn the volume up just enough to camouflage the conversation your colleague is having.

00:38.141 --> 00:40.086
It will sound weird at first but you'll get used to it.

00:40.294 --> 00:43.337
And it's highly effective, so you can at last get back to work.
