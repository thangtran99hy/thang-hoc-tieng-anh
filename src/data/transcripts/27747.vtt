00:05.232 --> 00:09.373
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road.

00:10.232 --> 00:14.454
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go.

00:15.111 --> 00:19.210
So, make the best of this test and don't ask why.

00:20.208 --> 00:24.234
It's not a question but a lesson learned in time.

00:24.444 --> 00:29.100
It's something unpredictable but in the end is right.

00:29.508 --> 00:33.111
I hope you had the time of your life.

00:37.596 --> 00:41.943
So, take the photographs and still frames in your mind.

00:42.732 --> 00:47.016
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time.

00:47.799 --> 00:51.898
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial,...

00:52.753 --> 00:56.913
...for what it's worth, it was worth all the while.

00:57.179 --> 01:01.835
It's something unpredictable but in the end is right.

01:02.268 --> 01:05.809
I hope you had the time of your life.
