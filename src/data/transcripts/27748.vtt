She's got a smile that it seems to me...

00:11.069 --> 00:14.779
...reminds me of childhood memories,...

00:14.898 --> 00:20.558
...where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky.

00:22.952 --> 00:26.350
Now and then when I see her face,...

00:26.458 --> 00:29.949
...she takes me away to that special place.

00:30.085 --> 00:32.049
And if I stared too long,...

00:32.267 --> 00:36.706
...I'd probably break down and cry.

00:37.999 --> 00:43.513
Oh, sweet child of mine.

00:45.843 --> 00:51.799
Oh, oh, oh, oh, sweet love of mine.
