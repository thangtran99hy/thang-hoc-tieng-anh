ï»¿Academy Award.

00:07.003 --> 00:09.151
I still can't believe I'm standing here.

00:12.185 --> 00:12.710
It's a dream.

00:15.143 --> 00:20.109
Long time ago, every year when I watched Oscars with my dad,...

00:20.240 --> 00:24.315
...sometimes with my mom, my dad always said...

00:24.883 --> 00:30.443
..."Son, you got so many movies out around the world,...

00:30.661 --> 00:32.311
...when are you gonna get one of these?"

00:34.351 --> 00:41.457
Then I just looked at my dad, "Hahaha! Dad, I only make comedy action movies."

00:43.004 --> 00:50.837
Many years later, I come to Hollywood, meeting with some big studio directors,...

00:51.705 --> 00:55.229
...my friend's house, Stallone's house.

00:56.298 --> 00:58.208
That was 23 years ago.

00:59.081 --> 01:01.627
I see these little things in his house.

01:02.358 --> 01:05.786
I touched it, I kissed it, I smelled it.

01:06.217 --> 01:08.302
I believe you still have my fingerprints in them.

01:09.051 --> 01:09.648
You keep it.

01:10.639 --> 01:13.241
Then I talked to myself, "I really want one."

01:15.435 --> 01:20.434
Finally, Cheryl called and I said, "Are you sure?"

01:22.772 --> 01:28.483
After 56 years in the film industry, making more than 200 films,...

01:28.774 --> 01:33.890
...I broke so many bones; finally this is mine!"

01:37.771 --> 01:38.381
This is mine.
