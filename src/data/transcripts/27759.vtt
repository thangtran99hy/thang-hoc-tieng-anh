For McDonald's, the Big Mac once had the mouths of millions of young people...

00:04.807 --> 00:06.483
...watering with anticipation.

00:07.021 --> 00:09.494
But millennials don't have as big of an appetite...

00:09.619 --> 00:11.880
...for the fast food chain's flagship product.

00:12.470 --> 00:16.351
In July, a top McDonald's franchisee sent an internal memo...

00:16.444 --> 00:20.395
...to fellow operators, saying that the Big Mac had gotten "less relevant."

00:21.467 --> 00:25.275
Just one in five millennials has even tried a Big Mac, the memo said.

00:25.646 --> 00:29.619
The number of hamburgers sold at McDonalds US restaurants has been flat...

00:29.735 --> 00:35.584
...for the past few years and grew at an annual rate of just one percent to two percent before that...

00:35.691 --> 00:38.455
...according to former high-ranking McDonald's executives.

00:38.870 --> 00:41.186
The Wall Street Journal Julie Jargon reports...

00:41.249 --> 00:44.053
that competing restaurant chains are pulling in customers...

00:44.198 --> 00:48.401
...by offering gourmet made-to-order burgers and quick casual service.

00:48.914 --> 00:52.854
That's at odds with McDonald's sales strategy for the last six decades,...

00:53.180 --> 00:55.367
...which is focused on speed and low cost.
