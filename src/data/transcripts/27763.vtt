ï»¿People in Silicon Valley are starting to worry about the drop-off in tech IPOs.

00:04.597 --> 00:05.356
And here's why.

00:06.307 --> 00:10.746
Investors that bet on young companies rely on IPOs to make their money back.

00:11.321 --> 00:12.238
They can't do that.

00:12.521 --> 00:15.902
They may stop writing checks to fund the next Google or Facebook.

00:16.611 --> 00:17.759
This is happening already.

00:18.571 --> 00:22.979
The amount of money invested in start-ups has fallen from a peak about six months ago.

00:24.937 --> 00:26.899
So why are we in this IPO desert?

00:27.621 --> 00:32.427
For one, about half the tech companies that went public in the US since 2010...

00:32.670 --> 00:34.664
...are trading below their IPO price.

00:34.947 --> 00:36.934
Just look at Twitter or GoPro.

00:37.495 --> 00:39.861
It's hard to sell investors on new stocks...

00:40.093 --> 00:43.263
...when too many of them got burned betting on the last IPOs.

00:44.039 --> 00:46.219
And two, there's a big expectations gap.

00:47.050 --> 00:49.330
There are more than 150 unicorns.

00:49.476 --> 00:53.544
That's Silicon Valley jargon for a start-up valued at a billion dollars or more.

00:54.298 --> 00:57.995
Many of these companies will be worth far less if they tried to go public now.

00:58.605 --> 01:02.747
So many of them are waiting and waiting, to try to improve their business...

01:02.857 --> 01:04.417
...and IPO at a higher price.

01:04.943 --> 01:06.844
These unicorns could be right to wait,...

01:07.063 --> 01:10.450
...or they could run out of money waiting for the perfect time to go public.
