Hey! You again.

00:04.682 --> 00:05.315
Natalie.

00:05.641 --> 00:08.971
Isn't it literally ironic how we run into each other every day?

00:10.592 --> 00:11.479
Good sir!

00:12.233 --> 00:14.100
Allow me to define ironic for you, fellow.

00:14.205 --> 00:16.791
There's verbal irony, dramatic irony, and situational irony,...

00:16.882 --> 00:17.825
...which is the one you speak of.

00:17.929 --> 00:20.556
That's the incongruity of the actual sequence of events...

00:20.652 --> 00:23.467
...and the normal or expected outcome of the sequence of events.

00:23.567 --> 00:25.871
So when you say that running into your friend every day is ironic,...

00:25.950 --> 00:27.342
...it's not ironic, it's just interesting.

00:27.458 --> 00:28.426
Irony taught!

00:29.218 --> 00:30.479
What? Who are you?

00:30.821 --> 00:34.150
I'm Captain Irony, here to educate the masses on the use of the word "irony."

00:34.269 --> 00:35.135
Hipsters love me.

00:35.808 --> 00:38.315
I've always wanted to know how to use the word "irony."

00:38.403 --> 00:39.523
I never really met anybody that knows...

00:39.629 --> 00:40.400
Shush, wait!

00:40.511 --> 00:46.434
So, you don't even have the power to restore balance and your catchphrase is "irony taught"?

00:46.590 --> 00:48.232
A captain without superpowers.

00:48.363 --> 00:49.265
Now, that's ironic.

00:49.375 --> 00:50.906
No, it's not. Believe me.

00:51.054 --> 00:53.946
Ironically, sometimes I think it'd be nice to not have powers.

00:54.397 --> 00:55.441
Did you just hear yourself?

00:55.519 --> 00:58.349
You just put the word "ironically" in front of a totally unrelated sentence.

00:58.522 --> 01:00.970
That's like saying, "Ironically the ocean is neat!"

01:01.745 --> 01:02.809
You know what's ironic?

01:02.893 --> 01:05.014
A captain who's a woman, am I right?

01:05.824 --> 01:07.357
Oh, that's so funny to me.

01:07.486 --> 01:07.713
Really?

01:07.973 --> 01:09.138
No, I was being ironic.

01:09.229 --> 01:10.325
Irony taught!
