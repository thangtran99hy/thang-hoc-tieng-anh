00:02.226 --> 00:03.555
So, what is your name?

00:04.182 --> 00:04.538
Ariel.

00:05.131 --> 00:05.765
Are you a mermaid?

00:06.561 --> 00:09.115
I'm not a mermaid but I do get compared to her a lot.

00:10.537 --> 00:11.491
She's a strong swimmer.

00:15.987 --> 00:18.652
I have thought about being a therapist because I give very sound advice...

00:18.791 --> 00:21.354
...and a lot of people ask me for advice...

00:21.530 --> 00:24.291
...and I'm not necessarily great at applying it to my own life...

00:24.843 --> 00:26.268
...but I value my opinion.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.687
I have an attraction to a coworker...
