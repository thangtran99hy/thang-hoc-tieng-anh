00:00.930 --> 00:01.773
ï»¿Hey.

00:03.661 --> 00:04.221
Is this enough?

00:04.575 --> 00:05.125
A little more.

00:05.238 --> 00:05.893
Grandma!

00:08.409 --> 00:08.942
There you go.

00:12.809 --> 00:13.620
There's no more room.

00:15.493 --> 00:16.339
Oh, look who's here.

00:20.309 --> 00:21.503
I know I had one more.

00:22.914 --> 00:23.313
More.

00:23.953 --> 00:24.441
How's it looking?

00:24.825 --> 00:25.761
Twenty more minutes.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.113
Eight, nine.

00:27.193 --> 00:27.862
We need one more.

00:28.358 --> 00:28.756
Yes.

00:30.202 --> 00:30.903
Let's enjoy.

00:33.385 --> 00:34.567
We need more rolls.

00:37.084 --> 00:38.176
There was a little girl.

00:38.382 --> 00:41.664
She became friends with every animal she met.

00:44.041 --> 00:45.168
It's getting late.

00:45.671 --> 00:46.783
Grandma should go.

00:47.749 --> 00:48.577
One more?

00:49.983 --> 00:54.022
In the end, all we really need more of is each other.

00:55.335 --> 00:57.600
Happy Thanksgiving from Publix,...

00:57.877 --> 00:59.223
...where shopping is a pleasure.
