We need a big tree,...

00:02.409 --> 00:03.819
...something for everyone to gather around.

00:05.571 --> 00:06.632
And you know what else I'm thinking?

00:07.599 --> 00:08.195
Lights!

00:08.592 --> 00:09.125
Some help.

00:09.795 --> 00:10.713
Got it!

00:11.835 --> 00:13.748
And the ornaments might take a little bit more time...

00:15.922 --> 00:17.035
...but we're gonna get it just right.

00:17.492 --> 00:18.362
What do you think, Bullseye?

00:19.452 --> 00:20.880
Okay, let's do this.

00:21.052 --> 00:21.373
Hey!

00:21.965 --> 00:23.243
How's this look?

00:24.783 --> 00:25.405
What do you think?

00:25.743 --> 00:28.173
It's like you, it's like you read my mind!
