When you were born, I told you life was very big and unknown.

00:11.393 --> 00:15.160
There were animals and cities and music.

00:16.107 --> 00:20.452
You'd fall in love, have passions, have meaning,...

00:21.923 --> 00:25.352
...but now it's 1979 and nothing means anything,...

00:26.243 --> 00:28.663
...and I know you less every day.

00:32.759 --> 00:34.920
I think maybe you guys can help me with Jamie.

00:35.175 --> 00:36.359
How do you be a good man?

00:36.865 --> 00:38.334
What does that even mean nowadays?

00:38.763 --> 00:40.995
Don't you need a man to raise a man?

00:41.487 --> 00:42.365
No, I don't think so.

00:43.109 --> 00:44.922
I think you're what's gonna work for him.

00:47.594 --> 00:49.291
You just feel guilty 'cause it's just me and you.

00:50.669 --> 00:51.884
You don't know what I'm feeling.

00:54.799 --> 00:57.623
Men always feel like they have to fix things for women...

00:57.839 --> 00:59.007
...but they're not doing anything.

00:59.277 --> 01:01.905
Just be there, somehow that's hard for all of you.

01:02.404 --> 01:05.006
Mom, I'm not "all men" okay, I'm just me.

01:05.412 --> 01:07.034
Well, yes and no.

01:13.172 --> 01:17.191
So sweetie, I don't know if we ever figure our lives out...

01:18.241 --> 01:19.967
..and the people who help you,...

01:20.209 --> 01:23.229
...they might not be who you thought or wanted.

01:24.362 --> 01:26.483
They might just be the people who show up.
