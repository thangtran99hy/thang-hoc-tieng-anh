Tamara is beyond beautiful.

00:23.632 --> 00:24.070
Thank you.

00:24.307 --> 00:25.180
Because of who you are,...

00:25.271 --> 00:29.182
...you have inspired me to be a better and stronger person on this planet.

00:29.783 --> 00:30.183

Okay, Corina. Now, Oscar is going to repeat all of those one by one...

00:35.061 --> 00:39.861
...and for each one, I want you to explain how what he says makes you feel...

00:40.404 --> 00:42.691
...and how it's significant to your relationship, okay?

00:43.025 --> 00:43.295
Okay.

Shakira Keller is a fantastic writer.

00:47.043 --> 00:47.550
I love that.

00:49.231 --> 00:53.252
One of the things that I do really pride myself on is my writing,...

00:53.327 --> 00:57.459
...and as much as I don't let you read what I write,...

00:58.551 --> 01:01.761
...I really do appreciate the fact that you think that.

01:02.107 --> 01:02.941
It makes me really happy.

01:03.651 --> 01:06.139
You are the most beautiful person I've ever met.

01:07.427 --> 01:08.497
I think that's very sweet.

01:08.775 --> 01:13.113
I don't think that's true, but I feel very humbled that someone thinks that.

01:13.995 --> 01:16.961
Accepting compliments doesn't mean you're arrogant or conceited,...

01:17.554 --> 01:20.075
...it's healthy for both you and your relationship...

01:20.270 --> 01:22.197
...by validating your partner's thoughts.
