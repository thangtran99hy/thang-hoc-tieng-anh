00:00.599 --> 00:03.647
Seismic activity is concentrated along fault lines:...

00:03.755 --> 00:05.830
...areas of fracture in the Earth's crust,...

00:05.987 --> 00:08.959
...generally found near ridges or tectonic plate boundaries.

00:10.067 --> 00:13.081
Constantly in motion, these huge plates sometimes collide,...

00:13.192 --> 00:14.875
...forcing one beneath the other.

00:15.530 --> 00:18.195
The resulting friction creates energy along the fault lines,...

00:18.311 --> 00:21.821
...which eventually become unstable and rupture, sending out a shock wave.

00:22.297 --> 00:24.621
The energy released is felt as an earthquake.

00:25.459 --> 00:26.709
After the initial jolt,...

00:26.806 --> 00:30.353
...aftershocks can strike as neighboring plates readjust into place.

00:31.225 --> 00:34.030
Most underground movement goes unnoticed by human beings,...

00:34.123 --> 00:36.230
...but occasionally, a big tremor strikes.

00:36.595 --> 00:38.853
Among the world's most active seismic zones:...

00:39.122 --> 00:43.288
...Asia, Turkey and Afghanistan, Northern Africa and the Americas.

00:43.453 --> 00:46.778
The moment magnitude scale rates energy release during an earthquake.

00:46.995 --> 00:50.838
It was devised to measure large tremors more accurately than the older Richter scale.

00:51.091 --> 00:52.368
In theory, there's no limit,...

00:52.553 --> 00:55.610
...but never has an earthquake measured more than the 9.5 magnitude...

00:55.731 --> 00:57.785
...recorded in Chile in 1960.

00:58.029 --> 01:01.347
The European macroseismic scale meanwhile rates intensity,...

01:01.521 --> 01:03.549
...in other words, possible consequences.

01:03.781 --> 01:04.764
There are 12 levels.

01:04.987 --> 01:07.022
One indicates the earthquake cannot be felt,...

01:07.154 --> 01:09.798
...or 12 indicates a total change in landscape.

01:10.064 --> 01:14.354
When a big quake strikes, the scale acts as a warning against other natural phenomena...

01:14.448 --> 01:18.825
...which could be triggered such as landslides, avalanches, or tsunamis.
