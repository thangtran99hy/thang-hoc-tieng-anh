00:02.147 --> 00:04.171
So, right now, I'm putting on my headset...

00:04.639 --> 00:07.359
...and I could see a kind of a jet plane in front of me.

00:07.450 --> 00:09.128
I'm about to put on my headphones.

00:09.362 --> 00:13.887
Looks like we're in some sort of futuristic landing pad to take off on this plane.

00:13.969 --> 00:17.665
I'm gonna put on my headphones, I'm gonna turn around and turn on the game.

00:19.885 --> 00:21.986
So, I have these controllers, whoops.

00:22.875 --> 00:24.463
So, these are my controllers.

00:25.250 --> 00:26.378
They're like little shooters.

00:26.455 --> 00:27.499
We're gonna turn around.

00:27.843 --> 00:28.890
Ready to rock.

00:29.126 --> 00:30.128
There we go.

00:30.539 --> 00:32.755
Okay, I'm kind of in outer space now.

00:33.388 --> 00:34.968
I'm trying to shoot aliens.

00:35.170 --> 00:36.564
Oh, I'm not a very good shot.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.845
Okay, I could use some practice here.

00:41.641 --> 00:47.164
I feel like this is like, a very futuristic Duck Hunt from the old days of Nintendo.

00:49.337 --> 00:51.471
And it's all very immersive.

00:51.597 --> 00:54.970
So, when I walk too far here, I can see the wall.

00:55.079 --> 00:56.921
It says I shouldn't touch that, whoa!

00:57.124 --> 00:58.650
Hey guys, the shield is awesome.

00:58.918 --> 01:00.295
Now I have two shields.

01:00.473 --> 01:01.514
That's amazing.
