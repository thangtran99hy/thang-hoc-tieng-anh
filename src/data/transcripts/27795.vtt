00:07.445 --> 00:08.210
Output.

00:10.195 --> 00:12.659
Master Bruce, your greatest fear is...

00:12.760 --> 00:13.179
Snakes?

00:13.305 --> 00:13.563
No.

00:13.673 --> 00:14.141
Clowns?

00:14.258 --> 00:16.848
No, it's being a part of a family again.

00:16.987 --> 00:20.127
No, now it's snake clowns because you put that idea in my head.

00:20.257 --> 00:23.035
Sir, you need to take responsibility for your life...

00:23.139 --> 00:26.081
...and it starts by raising the young orphan you adopted.

00:27.118 --> 00:28.759
I thought I was being sarcastic.

00:28.881 --> 00:30.176
Hello, secret camera!

00:31.784 --> 00:33.754
What? It's the Bat Cave!

00:33.969 --> 00:35.276
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

00:35.406 --> 00:36.451
Look, it's the Bat Sub!

00:36.541 --> 00:37.073
Don't touch that.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.004
The Bat Zeppelin!

00:38.107 --> 00:38.822
Don't touch that either.

00:38.896 --> 00:39.914
It's the Bat Kayak!

00:40.020 --> 00:40.687
Do I get a costume?

00:41.639 --> 00:42.202
I love it,...

00:42.311 --> 00:43.967
...but these pants are just a little tight.

00:44.137 --> 00:44.867
I got an idea.

00:45.090 --> 00:46.677
Rip! That's better.

00:46.789 --> 00:48.474
I can only look you in the eyes right now.

00:49.499 --> 00:50.532
Hi Batman.

00:50.641 --> 00:51.414
No way!

00:51.546 --> 00:53.541
Come catch your greatest enemy.

00:53.658 --> 00:55.135
Superman is my greatest enemy.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.480
Superman's not a bad guy!

00:56.595 --> 00:59.451
Then I'd say that I don't currently have a bad guy.

00:59.549 --> 01:02.403
I am fighting a few different people.

01:04.519 --> 01:05.263
I like to fight around.

01:07.779 --> 01:09.510
Let's go defeat the Joker.

01:09.956 --> 01:11.185
We're going on a family trip.

01:11.302 --> 01:12.533
I can wear my costume too.

01:12.641 --> 01:14.817
Well, luckily for us, you left your costume back at...

01:14.961 --> 01:15.379
Rip!

01:15.480 --> 01:17.563
Oh, no, under your clothes.

01:17.733 --> 01:18.663
That's perfect.
