00:07.963 --> 00:10.587
Violet, Klaus and Sunny were intelligent children.

00:10.848 --> 00:15.277
Most everything that happened to them was rife with misfortune and despair.

00:15.965 --> 00:18.302
Your parents have perished in a terrible fire.

00:19.805 --> 00:20.667
"Perished" means killed.

00:21.391 --> 00:22.956
We know what perished means.

00:32.443 --> 00:35.493
Hello, hello, hello children.

00:38.931 --> 00:41.467
I am Count Olaf, your new guardian.

00:42.042 --> 00:42.863
You know what this is?

00:42.941 --> 00:43.815
Looks like a list.

00:44.061 --> 00:45.549
Wrong, it's a list!

00:45.985 --> 00:46.934
A list of chores.

00:48.288 --> 00:50.074
We know you're just trying to steal our parents' fortune.

00:50.286 --> 00:51.756
We have to get out of this wretched place.

00:52.552 --> 00:53.260
Go back in the house,...

00:53.352 --> 00:54.050
...where it's safer...

00:54.237 --> 00:55.392
...and strangers can't get you.

00:56.153 --> 00:57.425
Strangers, where?

00:58.499 --> 01:00.265
The Baudelaire children will be destroyed.

01:00.541 --> 01:00.665
What?

01:04.601 --> 01:08.194
When the sand runs out, that fortune is mine.

01:09.176 --> 01:12.153
I didn't realize the sand went so quickly, I bought it online.

01:12.298 --> 01:14.433
You're gonna need to flip it a couple of times.

01:18.017 --> 01:19.513
My name is Captain Sham.

01:19.581 --> 01:21.495
This man is really Count Olaf in disguise.

01:21.565 --> 01:22.238
Aren't you smart?

01:23.986 --> 01:26.570
Wherever you go, I will hunt you down.

01:26.989 --> 01:28.560
Why do you hate us so much?

01:28.914 --> 01:30.217
Because it's fun.

01:32.515 --> 01:36.023
We are setting out on a very top secret expedition.

01:37.163 --> 01:39.265
What do you say, Baudelaires? Are you in?
