00:01.459 --> 00:04.567
To what did we owe the pleasure of your enlistment, Private Lynn?

00:05.693 --> 00:07.867
Sorry excuse for a warrior I'm turning out to be.

00:08.059 --> 00:10.857
Make it about something bigger than yourself.

00:12.491 --> 00:13.493
These men are fighters.

00:13.754 --> 00:14.963
Let your training guide you.

00:17.278 --> 00:17.889
Is this it?

00:18.077 --> 00:19.017
It's going down.

00:19.397 --> 00:19.747
What?

00:19.845 --> 00:20.719
Let's go!

00:21.249 --> 00:22.323
Shroom's been hit!

00:23.779 --> 00:24.241
Cover him!

00:26.565 --> 00:31.165
What you did that day no longer belongs to you.

00:31.527 --> 00:32.930
It's America's story now.

00:38.360 --> 00:41.932
If we just open the door a crack, the light comes pouring in.

00:47.690 --> 00:48.805
What really happened over there?

00:49.433 --> 00:50.667
I did what I had to do.

00:55.977 --> 01:01.965
For the first time in my life, I feel close to something bigger than myself.
