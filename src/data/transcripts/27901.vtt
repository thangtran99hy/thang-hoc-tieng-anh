Elon Musk is famous for his drive, but now he wants the rest of us...

00:05.600 --> 00:07.437
...to take our hands off the wheel.

00:07.903 --> 00:10.800
He's bringing out fully self-driving Teslas.

00:11.193 --> 00:12.913
Well, at least autonomous ready.

00:13.493 --> 00:14.947
This isn't just a software upgrade,...

00:15.031 --> 00:18.687
...which is how Tesla has updated its autonomous capabilities in the past.

00:19.483 --> 00:21.763
This is new hardware that includes eight cameras...

00:21.861 --> 00:24.747
...for a full 360-degree view of the environment,...

00:25.215 --> 00:30.310
...and enhanced ultrasonic sensors, as well as a huge bump in computing power.

00:32.072 --> 00:34.246
Musk is making typically big claims.

00:34.445 --> 00:37.405
He says that by the end of next year, he'll demonstrate a car...

00:37.687 --> 00:41.053
...that can drive from L.A. to New York all without the driver,...

00:41.273 --> 00:43.937
...or is it a passenger by that point, touching a thing.

00:44.522 --> 00:48.022
The full set of features will come at a cost, $8,000.
