ï»¿Hi everybody! Nikki here with an all-new Nikki's Wiki.

00:04.580 --> 00:06.622
Today, we'll be talking about fairies!

00:07.007 --> 00:09.713
My favorite is Tinker Bell from Peter Pan.

00:10.343 --> 00:13.915
Did you know that different cultures have all different types of fairies?

00:14.319 --> 00:16.148
Some are sweet and helpful,...

00:16.597 --> 00:19.487
...while others are tricky and mischievous.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.903
Some have wings, some don't.

00:23.681 --> 00:25.387
Some are as small as mice,...

00:25.701 --> 00:28.089
...and some are as tall as you and me!

00:28.623 --> 00:30.524
Some people don't think fairies are real.

00:31.416 --> 00:34.135
Those are the same boring people who don't believe in Santa...

00:34.275 --> 00:36.182
...and who don't think Peter Pan can fly.

00:36.935 --> 00:38.776
I feel bad for those people.

00:39.388 --> 00:43.239
Okay, one of my favorite types of fairies comes from Ireland.

00:43.605 --> 00:46.124
Yep, a leprechaun is a type of fairy!

00:46.560 --> 00:48.739
Just like Lucky with his lucky charms!

00:50.018 --> 00:52.073
I love my lucky charms!

00:52.429 --> 00:55.909
In Ireland, leprechauns like to hide from humans and play tricks on us!

00:56.300 --> 00:57.825
But you can keep them on your good side...

00:57.964 --> 01:00.127
...by leaving out bread and milk for them to eat and drink,...

01:00.469 --> 01:02.128
...as many Irish people do!
