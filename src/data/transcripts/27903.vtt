ï»¿Did you ever wonder what fish do all day?

00:02.378 --> 00:04.914
One way to find out is by going snorkeling.

00:05.149 --> 00:09.589
All you need are a mask, fins and a short tube called a snorkel.

00:10.109 --> 00:14.394
Then, just swim near the surface of the water and see what's happening under the sea!

00:19.253 --> 00:21.275
I just love people watching!

00:21.689 --> 00:25.200
A group of fish swimming together is called a school of fish.

00:25.703 --> 00:29.263
I can't wait to see what we learn today on Fishy's Wiki!

00:29.542 --> 00:33.579
Did you know scuba divers can go even deeper than snorkelers underwater?

00:34.053 --> 00:37.965
Scuba stands for Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus.

00:38.423 --> 00:43.247
Scuba divers wear special equipment to help them move, breathe and see underwater.

00:43.355 --> 00:45.664
Ooh, I look good!

00:45.856 --> 00:52.617
You can scuba for all sorts of fun reasons like just to see beautiful things, science.

00:52.717 --> 00:56.811
It's fascinating! I don't think anyone has cleaned this floor in years!

00:57.051 --> 01:00.995
Searching caves, photography,...

01:01.302 --> 01:02.114
Perfect!

01:02.441 --> 01:04.458
...and even making movies!

01:04.559 --> 01:05.925
To be or not to.

01:08.872 --> 01:10.595
Dory, let's do that again!

01:10.814 --> 01:12.777
But this time, remember your lines!

01:13.073 --> 01:16.601
One of the best places in the world to go for an underwater adventure...

01:16.709 --> 01:19.508
...is the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia.
