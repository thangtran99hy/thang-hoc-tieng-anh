He's called "the Mozart of chess" and I can see it.

00:04.695 --> 00:09.005
You couldn't understand how Mozart did what he did, it came from another world.

00:09.714 --> 00:13.942
And Magnus Carlsen is doing things that no human being I've met before can do.

00:15.975 --> 00:21.476
At one point, he played ten chess players at the same time, looking the other way...

00:21.803 --> 00:22.917
...so he couldn't see the boards.

00:25.949 --> 00:32.950
I mean, just think about it: ten chessboards that he has in his mind every second,...

00:38.161 --> 00:41.855
...doesn't lose track of what's happening on the boards...

00:42.267 --> 00:44.160
...and what he needs to do next.

00:47.239 --> 00:49.329
Can you explain what was going on in your head?

00:49.406 --> 00:54.667
Really, I was just focusing on trying to remember the positions...

00:55.047 --> 00:57.458
...and from time to time, I had to think a little bit...

00:57.552 --> 00:59.314
...to come up with a good move as well.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.851
Even he admits that it's not easy.

01:02.525 --> 01:06.931
I would wonder where a certain piece is...

01:07.193 --> 01:13.281
...and so I have to replay the game in my head from the very beginning.

01:13.468 --> 01:14.613
How long does it take you to do that?

01:15.461 --> 01:16.085
I don't know.

01:16.997 --> 01:18.137
Just half a minute or something?

01:22.447 --> 01:25.409
It will be interesting to try like, 20 people sometime.

01:25.485 --> 01:26.057
Have you ever done that?

01:26.389 --> 01:26.673
No.

01:26.933 --> 01:28.121
Ten is the most I've done.

01:28.603 --> 01:29.852
And, but you'd like to try more?

01:31.084 --> 01:31.762
It would be fun.
