00:04.911 --> 00:05.776
ï»¿Approach.

00:05.949 --> 00:08.470
Open your arms up wide like a proud eagle...

00:08.660 --> 00:12.356
...and then tilt your head in whichever direction you feel comfortable.

00:12.750 --> 00:15.641
Slightly raise your arm in the direction of your tilted head.

00:16.070 --> 00:18.466
This will indicate your intention to your partner...

00:18.617 --> 00:20.850
...and prevent any head to head collisions.

00:21.325 --> 00:24.434
Finally, glide in slowly and confidently.

00:24.703 --> 00:25.583
The squeeze.

00:25.689 --> 00:28.085
Maintaining your body in a semirigid manner...

00:28.173 --> 00:31.301
...will indicate to your friend that you are in control of the embrace.

00:31.850 --> 00:34.091
Make sure your arms are not like wet noodles...

00:34.254 --> 00:37.179
...but rather like the warm branches of a firm oak.

00:37.633 --> 00:41.051
Turn your head out at this point and stare into the horizon.

00:41.478 --> 00:42.170
The pat.

00:42.288 --> 00:44.960
The pat is the staple of any good man hug.

00:45.108 --> 00:47.050
Put your own creative spin on the pat.

00:47.357 --> 00:50.476
Do you like to use a fist or an openhanded karate chop?

00:50.585 --> 00:55.348
Whatever the gesture, make sure it is firm, confident, and filled with spirit.
