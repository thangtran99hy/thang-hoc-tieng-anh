I asked you to repeat that because I was too busy texting on my phone.

00:03.115 --> 00:05.603
I'm gonna hang up on you and pretend it was an accident.

00:05.766 --> 00:08.847
I'm attempting to sound empathetic because quality assurance is listening.

00:09.115 --> 00:11.858
The only perk of my job is not seeing your face.

00:12.124 --> 00:13.799
Please stop telling me this pointless story.

00:13.923 --> 00:16.317
Just tell me your problem so we can both get on with our day.

00:16.474 --> 00:20.275
I'm saying this with confidence but I have no idea if this information is true.

00:20.367 --> 00:22.097
I'm not sorry you feel that way.

00:22.272 --> 00:23.374
I'm not sorry that happened.

00:23.627 --> 00:24.709
Oh no, I understand.

00:24.777 --> 00:25.704
I just don't care.

00:25.869 --> 00:27.654
This job has made me dead inside.

00:27.845 --> 00:30.027
This job has given me a fear of talking on the phone.

00:30.215 --> 00:33.529
Listen babe, call me hon one more time and I'll burn this place down.

00:34.363 --> 00:35.137
Have a great day.
