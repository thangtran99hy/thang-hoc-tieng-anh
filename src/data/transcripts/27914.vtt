ï»¿I was a super shy kid and I found it really hard to express myself...

00:07.445 --> 00:10.969
...and I had a passion and I was really artistic...

00:11.557 --> 00:13.685
...and I knew I needed to get it out into the world...

00:13.862 --> 00:17.663
...but this inhibition was slowing me down from my passion.

00:19.306 --> 00:22.014
I realized that around age 12 that I didn't like myself...

00:22.148 --> 00:24.964
...so how was I expecting everybody else to like me and connect to me?

00:25.657 --> 00:27.059
And I realized that I was scared.

00:27.335 --> 00:29.261
And so, I made up this thing in my head...

00:29.407 --> 00:31.661
...where it was one scary thing per day.

00:32.371 --> 00:35.073
And whether that was just putting my hand up in class...

00:35.160 --> 00:38.947
...or talking to the cute boy or just expressing myself in some way,...

00:39.347 --> 00:41.849
...I had to put myself into that scary place.

00:42.055 --> 00:47.431
So, I took on that way of being and expanded it throughout my whole life.

00:48.063 --> 00:49.655
And I've got to this point where I am now:...

00:50.358 --> 00:54.853
...the world's foremost professional mermaid underwater performance artist...

00:55.197 --> 00:59.204
...and activist for the ocean animals, and I swim with great white sharks...

00:59.283 --> 01:01.851
...and tiger sharks and whales and dolphins.

01:02.525 --> 01:05.451
Thinking about doing something that you're scared of...

01:05.638 --> 01:09.422
...is so much more scary than the action of actually doing it.
