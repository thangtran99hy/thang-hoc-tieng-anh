ï»¿Can I touch her?

00:08.865 --> 00:09.353
John?

00:09.957 --> 00:10.722
What do you see?

00:10.952 --> 00:11.773
I'm not sure.

00:12.835 --> 00:14.593
Joe, take a look at this.

00:15.508 --> 00:17.997
4:16. Bible verse?

00:18.469 --> 00:19.282
That's the time.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.187
4:16 precisely.

00:22.603 --> 00:26.733
He knew that we would arrive at the apartment at exactly 4:16...

00:26.837 --> 00:30.037
...because he knows everything.

00:31.219 --> 00:33.763
See, he's just like me.

00:34.516 --> 00:35.721
He sees things,...

00:37.941 --> 00:38.948
...only he's better,...

00:39.963 --> 00:40.892
...a whole lot better.

00:42.478 --> 00:43.001
Let's go!

00:43.930 --> 00:45.062
Go! Go! Go!

00:45.177 --> 00:47.234
The whole thing's a trap and we're walking right into it.

00:47.365 --> 00:48.381
Come on, get him!

00:51.109 --> 00:52.017
You gotta talk to me.

00:52.110 --> 00:53.017
He's way ahead of us...

00:53.861 --> 00:55.887
...and we're doing exactly what he wants us to do.

00:59.258 --> 01:00.511
He's way beyond me...

01:02.336 --> 01:03.447
...and I can't stop him,...

01:05.353 --> 01:07.249
...which begs a more important question:...

01:09.156 --> 01:10.472
...is he really worth stopping?
