00:00.771 --> 00:02.449
I understand you're super tech, Mills.

00:03.363 --> 00:04.746
We're all a bunch of cavemen, huh?

00:04.875 --> 00:05.540
Not all of you.

00:06.578 --> 00:07.187
What's going on?

00:12.067 --> 00:13.725
This is just part of the training, right?

00:18.142 --> 00:19.187
No!

00:22.510 --> 00:26.345
They had us, but while she was there they let us walk.

00:26.910 --> 00:27.223
Why?

00:28.483 --> 00:29.413
Identify.

00:29.581 --> 00:31.151
Did you bring these marines here?

00:31.764 --> 00:32.376
Yes.

00:32.613 --> 00:33.117
My God.

00:34.197 --> 00:35.364
Some programmer screwed up somewhere.

00:35.480 --> 00:37.443
No, screwups aren't so efficient.

00:41.123 --> 00:42.288
Those are our positions.

00:42.420 --> 00:43.359
They're copying us?

00:47.274 --> 00:48.069
Let me go.

00:49.230 --> 00:50.387
Please, stop!

00:53.839 --> 00:56.296
There's a leader, you need to find it.

00:59.201 --> 01:00.285
Identify.

01:05.955 --> 01:06.947
Identify.

01:08.638 --> 01:09.755
Identify.

01:11.357 --> 01:12.191
Human.
