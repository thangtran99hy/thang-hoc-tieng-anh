00:02.640 --> 00:06.056
And if we should die tonight,...

00:06.573 --> 00:09.357
...we should all die together.

00:09.672 --> 00:15.786
Raise a glass of wine for the last time.

00:16.017 --> 00:19.249
Calling out, Father, oh.

00:19.773 --> 00:22.200
Prepare as we will...

00:22.435 --> 00:28.268
...watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side.

00:28.899 --> 00:33.678
Desolation comes upon the sky.

00:34.813 --> 00:36.719
Now I see fire...

00:38.812 --> 00:41.424
...inside the mountain.

00:41.520 --> 00:43.389
I see fire...

00:45.305 --> 00:47.579
...burning the trees.

00:47.767 --> 00:51.247
And I see fire...

00:51.701 --> 00:54.047
...hollowing souls.

00:54.237 --> 00:57.757
I see fire,...

00:58.096 --> 01:00.616
...blood in the breeze,...

01:00.873 --> 01:05.603
...and I hope that you remember me.
