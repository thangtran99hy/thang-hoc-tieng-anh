ï»¿It's whoever, not whomever.

00:01.693 --> 00:02.231
No, it's whomever.

00:02.303 --> 00:04.504
No, whomever is never actually right.

00:04.612 --> 00:05.826
No, sometimes it's right.

00:05.907 --> 00:09.085
Michael is right; it's a made-up word used to trick students.

00:09.160 --> 00:12.915
No, actually, whomever is the formal version of the word.

00:13.013 --> 00:16.201
Obviously, it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly.

00:16.303 --> 00:17.149
Not a native speaker.

00:17.253 --> 00:19.525
I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say...

00:19.754 --> 00:22.704
...because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night.

00:22.843 --> 00:23.865
Do you really know which one is correct?

00:23.971 --> 00:24.863
I don't know.

00:24.967 --> 00:28.302
It's whom when it's the object of the sentence and who when it's the subject.

00:28.389 --> 00:29.159
That sounds right.

00:29.242 --> 00:30.439
Well, it sounds right but is it?

00:30.525 --> 00:31.989
How did Ryan use it, as an object?

00:32.079 --> 00:32.453
As an object.

00:32.545 --> 00:33.979
Ryan used me as an object.

00:34.269 --> 00:35.355
Is he right about that?

00:35.479 --> 00:36.377
How did he use it again?

00:36.456 --> 00:41.052
It was, "I wanted Michael," the subject, "to explain the computer system," the object...

00:41.135 --> 00:41.533
Thank you.

00:41.635 --> 00:46.727
..."to whomever," meaning us, the indirect object, which is the correct usage of the word.
