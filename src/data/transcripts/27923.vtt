Everybody loves the things you do,...

00:10.007 --> 00:15.925
...from the way you talk to the way you move.

00:18.748 --> 00:22.646
Everybody here is watching you...

00:23.389 --> 00:29.116
...'cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true.

00:32.082 --> 00:35.902
But if by chance you're here alone,...

00:36.849 --> 00:42.536
...can I have a moment before I go?

00:45.149 --> 00:48.947
'Cause I've been by myself all night long,...

00:50.376 --> 00:56.167
...hoping you're someone I used to know.

00:56.867 --> 00:58.497
You look like a movie.

01:00.245 --> 01:03.213
You sound like a song.

01:03.553 --> 01:10.065
My God, this reminds me of when we were young.

01:10.646 --> 01:16.655
Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time...

01:16.714 --> 01:23.549
...that we might be exactly like we were before we realized...

01:23.954 --> 01:29.306
...we were sad of getting old, it made us restless.

01:29.969 --> 01:31.930
It was just like a movie.

01:33.327 --> 01:36.598
It was just like a song.
