00:00.126 --> 00:01.341
ï»¿You should be an engineer.

00:01.499 --> 00:02.416
I'm a Negro woman.

00:02.526 --> 00:04.348
I'm not gonna entertain the impossible.

00:04.409 --> 00:06.332
I'm standing beneath a spaceship.

00:06.471 --> 00:08.024
We are living the impossible!

00:09.442 --> 00:11.810
The IBM data processing system.

00:11.971 --> 00:13.144
We have to know how to program it.

00:15.055 --> 00:15.528
Attagirl.

00:16.783 --> 00:19.323
NASA doesn't commission females for the engineer program.

00:19.459 --> 00:21.477
Every time we have a chance to get ahead,...

00:21.705 --> 00:23.154
I would like to attend today's briefing.

00:23.245 --> 00:24.847
There is no protocol for women attending.

00:25.053 --> 00:25.927
...they move the finish line.

00:27.091 --> 00:28.830
You all should be thankful you have jobs at all.

00:31.321 --> 00:33.319
I don't even know if I can keep up in that room.

00:35.426 --> 00:37.332
You're better with the numbers than anyone in that cabinet.

00:39.865 --> 00:42.093
You've been gone for 300 hours.

00:42.515 --> 00:43.722
It felt like it to me, too.

00:44.212 --> 00:46.692
You're never where I need you to be, where the hell do you go every day?

00:46.787 --> 00:48.572
The colored bathroom is a mile away.

00:50.161 --> 00:52.323
We all get to the peak together or we don't get there at all.

00:54.811 --> 00:57.144
More than 50 million people are watching this launch.

00:57.809 --> 00:59.121
John, the IBM is wrong.

00:59.249 --> 01:00.640
Let's get the girls to check the numbers.

01:01.070 --> 01:01.790
My gals are ready.

01:02.002 --> 01:02.707
We can do the work.

01:03.929 --> 01:04.501
Colonel Glenn?

01:04.727 --> 01:07.307
It's good to know NASA hasn't given up on good old-fashioned brain power.

01:10.239 --> 01:13.677
The Friendship 7 has experienced some sort of a malfunction.

01:13.831 --> 01:16.075
There's a real fireball outside, it's getting a little hot in here.

01:16.265 --> 01:17.781
We're in the fight of our lives, people!
