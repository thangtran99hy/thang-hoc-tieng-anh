ï»¿We are all trying to figure out how to pay for those pricey visits...

00:05.683 --> 00:07.730
...to friends and family this holiday season.

00:08.037 --> 00:10.408
Don't let those high prices get you down.

00:10.557 --> 00:14.598
Travel expert Mike Siegel is showing us three money-saving travel ideas...

00:14.760 --> 00:16.289
...to beat that holiday rush.

00:17.441 --> 00:19.655
First up, be tardy to the party.

00:21.379 --> 00:24.095
Flying on Christmas day, flying on New Year's Day, New Year's Eve,...

00:24.187 --> 00:25.422
...you can get a big deal.

00:25.602 --> 00:28.825
Even though your holiday meal might be a bit cold when you arrive,...

00:28.977 --> 00:32.565
...Mike says you can save 50% or more on tickets if you wait.

00:32.734 --> 00:33.817
And for your flight back,...

00:34.048 --> 00:39.339
...Travelzoo researchers says December 31st and January 6th are your cheapest bets.

00:40.205 --> 00:43.884
The next travel-saving technique: book tickets separately.

00:44.006 --> 00:46.785
Getting big blocks of tickets with the airline is a tough thing.

00:47.165 --> 00:50.522
If you're gonna buy that, usually they're not gonna give you any kind of deal.

00:50.971 --> 00:53.381
And finally, stay at a business hotel.

00:53.654 --> 00:57.225
So check out hotel chains like Holiday Inn Express and Residence Inn.

00:57.399 --> 00:59.693
Business hotels really take a beating over the holidays...

00:59.770 --> 01:01.285
...because no one's traveling for business.

01:01.635 --> 01:06.045
So if you're willing to stay in more of an industrial park area or a business area,...

01:06.394 --> 01:07.181
...they'll give deals.

01:07.330 --> 01:12.346
Many of the big chain business hotels drop their rates by 30% around the holidays.
