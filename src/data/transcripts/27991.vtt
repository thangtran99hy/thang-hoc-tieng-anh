Everyone around me, they feel connected to something;...

00:07.447 --> 00:10.344
...connected to something I'm not.

00:13.192 --> 00:14.042
You were dying.

00:16.209 --> 00:17.129
We saved you.

00:18.141 --> 00:19.607
And now, you save others.

00:20.568 --> 00:21.819
I know I have a past.

00:24.029 --> 00:25.569
I'll find out who I was.

00:34.764 --> 00:38.243
Everything they told you was a lie.

00:38.622 --> 00:39.511
Who are you?

00:41.325 --> 00:43.566
They did not save your life.

00:44.933 --> 00:46.252
They stole it.
