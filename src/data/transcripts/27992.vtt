00:05.934 --> 00:09.547
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go.

00:09.739 --> 00:13.342
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show.

00:13.677 --> 00:15.752
You're giving me a million reasons,...

00:15.885 --> 00:17.519
...give me a million reasons,...

00:17.637 --> 00:19.568
...giving me a million reasons,...

00:19.766 --> 00:21.319
...about a million reasons.

00:21.431 --> 00:24.680
If I had a highway, I would run for the hills.

00:24.806 --> 00:28.180
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still.

00:28.336 --> 00:30.769
But you're giving me a million reasons,...

00:31.037 --> 00:32.586
...give me a million reasons,...

00:32.689 --> 00:34.575
...giving me a million reasons,...

00:34.747 --> 00:36.336
...about a million reasons.

00:36.465 --> 00:40.641
I bow down to pray,...

00:40.901 --> 00:43.902
...I try to make the worse seem better.

00:44.015 --> 00:48.345
Lord, show me the way...

00:48.553 --> 00:51.851
...to cut through all this worn out leather.

00:52.094 --> 00:58.701
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away.

00:59.029 --> 01:03.840
But baby, I just need one good one to stay.
