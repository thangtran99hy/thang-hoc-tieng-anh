ï»¿Did Liz get a new top?

00:09.513 --> 00:10.701
No, you've seen that before.

00:11.473 --> 00:12.347
Never with that skirt.

00:13.113 --> 00:15.404
We should probably stop staring before it gets creepy, though.

00:15.749 --> 00:16.031
Yeah.

00:17.055 --> 00:17.631
Too late.

00:19.229 --> 00:19.855
You guys are losers.

00:22.803 --> 00:26.143
So, to become an Avenger, are there like trials or an interview?

00:26.198 --> 00:29.809
Just don't do anything I would do, and definitely don't do anything I wouldn't do.

00:31.122 --> 00:33.105
There's a little gray area in there and that's where you operate.

00:33.712 --> 00:33.897
Alright?

00:34.689 --> 00:36.448
That's not a hug, I'm just grabbing the door for you.

00:36.656 --> 00:38.027
Alright kid, good luck out there.

00:41.579 --> 00:42.883
Listen, I know school sucks.

00:43.029 --> 00:44.658
Peter, you still with us?

00:44.875 --> 00:45.665
Uh, yeah, yeah.

00:46.215 --> 00:48.264
I know you wanna save the world but...

00:50.537 --> 00:51.299
...you're not ready yet.

00:53.865 --> 00:54.652
You're the Spider-man.

00:55.153 --> 00:55.625
No, I'm not!

00:56.196 --> 00:57.384
I'm not! This is just a costume. This is...

00:57.491 --> 00:58.576
You were on the ceiling!

01:00.067 --> 01:03.700
Stay close to the ground and stay out of trouble.

01:09.221 --> 01:10.709
Forget the flying monster guy.

01:10.847 --> 01:12.226
There are people who handle this sort of thing.

01:12.288 --> 01:14.430
I'm sick of him treating me like a kid all the time.

01:14.562 --> 01:15.587
But you are a kid.

01:15.780 --> 01:17.192
This is my chance to prove myself.

01:19.852 --> 01:21.488
Peter, what is going on with you?

01:22.010 --> 01:23.903
I'm really sorry, I'm so busy, I'm slammed.

01:25.257 --> 01:25.782
Don't mess with me...

01:26.606 --> 01:29.187
...'cause I will kill you and everybody you love.
