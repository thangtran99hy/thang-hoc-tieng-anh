00:02.243 --> 00:03.811
ï»¿Another year over.

00:04.013 --> 00:05.360
Where do they go to?

00:05.473 --> 00:07.421
It's a mystery.

00:08.762 --> 00:14.202
Now, it's December. So much to remember before Christmas Eve.

00:14.996 --> 00:17.814
I'm already late and my train is delayed.

00:17.921 --> 00:20.490
Disruption on the line.

00:21.335 --> 00:24.241
I race into work and the place is berserk.

00:24.483 --> 00:26.773
Yes, it's Christmas time.

00:27.289 --> 00:32.578
I want to find the greatest gift I can give my family...

00:33.405 --> 00:38.176
...but right now, I don't have time to breathe.

00:38.551 --> 00:43.715
I want to find the greatest gift I can give my family.

00:44.499 --> 00:49.329
The greatest gift I can give is me!

00:49.551 --> 00:55.517
Now, I can meet with the boss and empty out my inbox, all simultaneously,...

00:56.097 --> 01:02.016
...leaving me time to spend with my family and friends where I want to be.

01:02.279 --> 01:07.573
I want to find the greatest gift I can give my family.

01:08.336 --> 01:13.174
The greatest gift that I can give is me!
