00:00.771 --> 00:02.589
Gifts are allowed through the checkpoint.

00:02.925 --> 00:05.131
We just ask that you refrain from wrapping them...

00:05.205 --> 00:06.898
...until you get through the checkpoint.

00:07.395 --> 00:10.441
If there is something in your gift that needs to be inspected,...

00:10.751 --> 00:12.117
...we may have to open it,...

00:12.293 --> 00:13.671
...and this can slow down the line.

00:15.768 --> 00:19.495
Toy weapons and replicas are not permitted in your carry-on bags.

00:19.747 --> 00:22.528
They can, however, be packed in checked luggage.

00:24.526 --> 00:27.847
Small gaming consoles, small toys, things of that sort,...

00:27.924 --> 00:29.993
...they can be placed in your carry-on bag.

00:30.698 --> 00:34.302
If you do have large electronics, game consoles,...

00:34.534 --> 00:37.599
...they need to be placed in a separate bin for screening.
