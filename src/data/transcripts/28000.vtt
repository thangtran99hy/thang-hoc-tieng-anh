I guess, I just don't understand why anyone would use spaces over tabs.

00:06.717 --> 00:09.313
Like, if it's all the same, why not just use tabs?

00:09.986 --> 00:12.249
Because it could look different on other people's computers.

00:12.319 --> 00:14.716
Tabs create smaller file sizes, all right?

00:14.785 --> 00:18.772
I run a compression company, trust me, I've devoted my life to minimalizing file sizes.

00:18.835 --> 00:24.365
It's what I do, I mean, I do not get why anyone would use spaces over tabs.

00:24.426 --> 00:26.530
I mean, why not just use Vim over Emacs?

00:27.407 --> 00:28.561
I do use Vim over Emacs.

00:28.657 --> 00:29.666
Oh, God, help us.

00:30.328 --> 00:35.339
Okay, you know what, I just... I don't think this is going to work, I'm so sorry.

00:35.705 --> 00:39.059
I mean like, what, are we going to bring kids into this world with that over their heads?

00:39.127 --> 00:40.465
That's not really fair to them, don't you think?

00:40.671 --> 00:42.327
Kids? We haven't even slept together.

00:42.456 --> 00:44.279
And guess what, it's never going to happen now,...

00:44.348 --> 00:48.633
...because there is no way I'm going to be with someone who uses spaces over tabs.

00:50.917 --> 00:51.411
Richard.

00:55.491 --> 00:58.069
Wow, okay goodbye.

00:58.867 --> 01:00.496
One tab saves you eight spaces.
