Communicating underwater is challenging.

00:10.693 --> 00:12.557
Light and odors don't travel well...

00:12.873 --> 00:15.394
...so it's hard for animals to see or smell.

00:16.337 --> 00:20.993
But sound moves about four times faster in water than in air...

00:21.447 --> 00:26.885
...so in this dark environment, marine mammals often rely on vocalization to communicate.

00:28.194 --> 00:33.439
Whale songs are one of the most sophisticated communication systems in the animal kingdom.

00:33.954 --> 00:36.357
Only a few species are known to sing:...

00:36.878 --> 00:42.835
...Blue, Fin, Bowhead, Minke whales and of course, Humpback whales.

00:43.958 --> 00:45.378
We don't know this for sure,...

00:45.553 --> 00:48.974
...because it's essentially impossible to observe the internal organs...

00:49.195 --> 00:50.739
...of a living, singing whale,...

00:51.171 --> 00:55.967
...but we think that when a whale sings, muscular contractions in the throat and chest...

00:56.301 --> 01:01.431
...move air from the lungs across the U-fold and into the laryngeal sacs,...

01:01.842 --> 01:03.518
...causing the U-fold to vibrate.

01:04.273 --> 01:08.995
The resulting sound resonates in the sacs like a choir singing in a cathedral,...

01:09.994 --> 01:14.310
...making songs loud enough to propagate up to thousands of kilometers away.
