Backing up your iPhone is a smart idea all around.

00:03.848 --> 00:06.762
It safeguards your important data like pictures and contacts.

00:07.126 --> 00:10.836
And it means you can switch all your info to a brand new device easy-peasy.

00:11.441 --> 00:15.118
There are a number of ways to back up, but here's how you do it on iCloud.

00:15.759 --> 00:17.756
iCloud is a digital home for your data,...

00:17.987 --> 00:21.098
...so you can use it to back up your phone without having to plug it into anything.

00:21.645 --> 00:21.949
Magic!

00:22.793 --> 00:25.185
First off, connect your phone to a Wi-Fi network.

00:25.844 --> 00:27.703
Then, we take a trip from your home screen menu.

00:28.092 --> 00:31.782
Tap Settings, followed by iCloud and Back up.

00:32.597 --> 00:35.631
Make sure the iCloud back up bar shows green, that means it's on...

00:36.087 --> 00:37.837
...and simply tap Back Up Now below.

00:38.317 --> 00:41.351
The process might take a while, but trust us: it's worth the wait.

00:42.296 --> 00:43.930
And all your stuff's stored online.

00:44.346 --> 00:46.655
Yes, even that guilty pleasures playlist.
