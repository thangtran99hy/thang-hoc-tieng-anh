00:01.040 --> 00:02.497
ï»¿Who's that lady in front of our door?

00:04.989 --> 00:06.080
That'll be your grandmother.

00:06.729 --> 00:07.819
Holy...

00:08.421 --> 00:09.689
It's a MacBook, darling.

00:10.205 --> 00:10.808
What are you doing here?

00:11.653 --> 00:13.617
You are denying the girl her potential.

00:13.841 --> 00:15.941
How many seven-year-olds are doing advanced calculus?

00:16.122 --> 00:18.019
You forgot the negative sign on the exponent.

00:18.140 --> 00:19.343
Mary, why didn't you say anything?

00:19.600 --> 00:21.913
Hank says I'm not supposed to correct older people.

00:22.962 --> 00:24.461
Nobody likes a smart-ass.

00:26.064 --> 00:28.913
We petition the court to grant my client full custody of the child.

00:28.999 --> 00:29.437
No!

00:30.715 --> 00:31.649
You're gonna take that girl.

00:31.719 --> 00:35.043
You're gonna loan her out to some think tank where she can talk nontrivial zeros...

00:35.118 --> 00:37.212
...with a bunch of old Russian guys for the rest of her life.

00:37.327 --> 00:38.711
And you'd bury her under a rock.

00:39.045 --> 00:39.847
Evelyn, stop!

00:40.213 --> 00:42.441
I'm raising her how I believe Diane would have wanted.

00:48.809 --> 00:51.641
If anybody takes that baby away, I'll smother you in your sleep.

00:53.535 --> 00:55.771
My sister wanted Mary to be a kid.

00:55.969 --> 00:58.316
She wanted her to have friends and to be happy.

00:58.543 --> 00:59.980
Tell us, do you have health insurance?

01:00.397 --> 01:00.564
No.

01:00.957 --> 01:02.126
Did you spend the night in jail?

01:02.180 --> 01:02.833
Objection!

01:06.447 --> 01:07.609
What's your greatest fear?

01:07.935 --> 01:08.962
That I'll ruin Mary's life.

01:09.117 --> 01:09.424
Mary!

01:10.136 --> 01:10.695
Mary!

01:12.034 --> 01:12.833
She's bossy.

01:13.339 --> 01:13.869
I've heard that.

01:16.960 --> 01:17.898
He's a good person.

01:18.491 --> 01:19.852
He wanted me before I was smart.
