00:02.988 --> 00:05.050
The mission's primary goal has been achieved.

00:06.573 --> 00:09.379
We're looking at a large single cell, biological.

00:12.784 --> 00:15.615
I'd hate to jump the gun, but I think it's time.

00:18.555 --> 00:23.127
We're looking at the first proof of life beyond Earth.

00:23.349 --> 00:24.373
You're finally a daddy.

00:25.241 --> 00:27.009
It's going to be a big custody battle over this one.

00:29.228 --> 00:30.221
Oh, it's beautiful.

00:35.077 --> 00:35.561
Hugh!

00:39.179 --> 00:40.005
No, no, we're not going in there.

00:40.076 --> 00:41.219
Get your goddamn hand off of it now.

00:41.284 --> 00:41.685
What are we going to do?

00:41.747 --> 00:42.642
There's a man in there!

00:49.450 --> 00:52.457
As we set sail, we ask God's blessing...

00:54.347 --> 00:57.760
...on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure...

00:58.287 --> 00:59.581
...on which man has ever embarked.

01:07.389 --> 01:11.854
This nation will continue to be a pioneer in the new frontier of space.
