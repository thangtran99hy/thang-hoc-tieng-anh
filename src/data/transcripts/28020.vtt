ï»¿Baby!

00:03.965 --> 00:04.168
Hey!

00:04.263 --> 00:05.159
You behaving yourself?

00:14.999 --> 00:16.066
We got multiple explosives.

00:16.159 --> 00:17.017
We need help down here.

00:17.438 --> 00:20.042
We can't have our citizens on the streets with all these threats.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.631
Every inch of this city is getting searched.

00:23.442 --> 00:24.169
We're shutting it down.

00:26.489 --> 00:28.884
A taxi picked up a guy matching White House's description.

00:29.480 --> 00:30.479
Could be he's on his way to New York.

00:32.582 --> 00:34.082
Are there more bombs?

00:47.151 --> 00:47.937
What I saw today?

00:48.593 --> 00:49.403
Good versus evil.

00:52.431 --> 00:53.369
Love versus hate.

00:56.075 --> 00:57.832
There's only one weapon you have to fight back with.

01:01.595 --> 01:01.938
It's love.

01:06.136 --> 01:07.523
Wrap our arms around each other.

01:09.779 --> 01:11.445
I don't think there's any way that they could ever win.
