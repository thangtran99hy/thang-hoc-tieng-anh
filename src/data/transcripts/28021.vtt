ï»¿Hey guys!

00:00.873 --> 00:02.445
Ready to learn to draw me?

00:02.696 --> 00:06.736
Okay, grab your mighty pen ultimate or just a regular pencil; that works, too.

00:07.292 --> 00:08.725
First, let's draw my head.

00:09.250 --> 00:10.151
You know, ears.

00:11.309 --> 00:12.093
Eyes.

00:13.359 --> 00:13.957
Mouth.

00:14.539 --> 00:15.237
Stuff like that.

00:15.866 --> 00:16.710
Then, my neck.

00:16.947 --> 00:17.529
I need that.

00:17.621 --> 00:18.463
It holds my head up!

00:19.282 --> 00:20.358
Now, let's draw my body.

00:20.828 --> 00:22.131
Don't forget the "D" for Drew!

00:23.892 --> 00:24.945
Two arms.

00:26.027 --> 00:28.601
With my mighty pen ultimate in one hand, of course!

00:30.877 --> 00:31.513
Two legs.

00:32.554 --> 00:33.831
Kangaroo legs?

00:34.148 --> 00:34.899
No way!

00:35.375 --> 00:36.241
Drew legs!

00:37.370 --> 00:39.529
Okay, now I need my superhero cape!

00:40.656 --> 00:43.432
In my latest adventure, I save a unicorn.

00:43.592 --> 00:45.023
Let's draw a unicorn horn!

00:46.655 --> 00:49.951
Wings, even though that would make me a pegacorn or an alicorn.

00:50.691 --> 00:52.635
Hey! I just think wings are cool, ok?

00:53.343 --> 00:57.332
Finally, let's draw a unicorn laser shooting out of my magical unicorn horn.

00:58.545 --> 00:58.893
Yeah!

00:59.072 --> 01:00.472
Take that, bad guys!

01:00.785 --> 01:02.581
Anyways, that's how you draw me!
