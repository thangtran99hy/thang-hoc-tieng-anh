00:09.111 --> 00:12.133
I cannot really describe to you the emotions of the kids.

00:12.247 --> 00:16.975
It's something as if they have got a new friend that can be only his friend.

00:18.736 --> 00:22.510
This time of heavy bombardments, there's nothing we can do.

00:22.929 --> 00:25.515
At least we can bring some joy to these kids.

00:27.243 --> 00:32.104
One of my daughters, Jasmine, at that time told me, "Daddy, kids need to play with toys."

00:32.552 --> 00:34.222
And I told her toys are expensive.

00:34.325 --> 00:36.727
I cannot buy toys for all the hundreds of kids.

00:36.832 --> 00:39.345
She said, "I have so many toys, I don't need to play."

00:39.425 --> 00:40.361
"Why don't you take them?"

00:44.433 --> 00:49.332
I walked for about hours now, for about six, seven hours, with all these toys with me.

00:49.949 --> 00:51.609
I have tried hard to dodge a bullet.

00:51.762 --> 00:54.171
If I make it, a lot of kids will be happy.

01:05.861 --> 01:09.365
Kids keep on coming to me and saying, "You see all these toys I have?"

01:09.673 --> 01:10.470
"These are all from you."

01:10.553 --> 01:11.469
"I've been collecting them."

01:11.572 --> 01:13.191
"I have a family of toys now."

01:13.327 --> 01:14.469
It's just beautiful.
