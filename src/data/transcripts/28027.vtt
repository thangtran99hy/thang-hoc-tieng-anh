00:00.254 --> 00:03.337
Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over...

00:03.453 --> 00:04.785
...when I retake the Iron Throne.

00:04.859 --> 00:05.525
Retake?

00:06.538 --> 00:08.555
Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?

00:08.689 --> 00:11.360
My father sat there before he was murdered.

00:12.043 --> 00:17.023
If you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say "take" the Iron Throne?

00:17.568 --> 00:19.413
I didn't come here to argue grammar.
