ï»¿Oh, I booked us a table tonight at Carluccio's for 7.

00:03.752 --> 00:06.165
Oh, that's nice. We like it at Carluccio's, don't we?

00:07.556 --> 00:08.406
I'll grab that.

00:12.755 --> 00:13.323
Stern!

00:14.875 --> 00:15.761
Can I help you?

00:16.429 --> 00:19.111
It's me, Tel. Your friend.

00:19.926 --> 00:21.636
I'm sorry, I don't know you.

00:22.552 --> 00:23.730
We've been friends for years.

00:23.905 --> 00:25.379
We went to school together, remember?

00:26.383 --> 00:28.227
I'm sorry, I think you have the wrong flat.

00:28.356 --> 00:30.469
Oh, come on, Stern, you must remember.

00:30.577 --> 00:33.211
All the nights out we had, the holidays, all the drinking?

00:33.435 --> 00:34.960
Look, remember this?

00:35.369 --> 00:37.320
This is us. It's me and you.

00:39.455 --> 00:40.223
That's me.

00:41.595 --> 00:42.481
I look happy.

00:44.376 --> 00:44.789
Tel!

00:45.132 --> 00:47.298
Yes, Stern, that's me.

00:48.951 --> 00:50.803
Tel, what's happened to me?

00:51.792 --> 00:53.331
Why am I wearing a cardigan, Tel?

00:53.452 --> 00:54.277
I hate cardigans.

00:54.365 --> 00:55.434
What's going on with me?

00:55.551 --> 00:56.389
I don't understand.

00:56.485 --> 00:57.242
I'm so scared.

00:57.355 --> 00:58.138
It's okay, Stern.

00:58.621 --> 01:01.052
All the boys are going out tonight and you're coming with us.

01:02.669 --> 01:04.800
Joel, these shirts need folding.

01:08.688 --> 01:12.199
I'm sorry, Tel, I can't come out tonight.

01:12.882 --> 01:14.527
There are some clothes that need folding.

01:15.465 --> 01:17.117
Stern, no.

01:20.191 --> 01:21.143
Goodbye, friend.
