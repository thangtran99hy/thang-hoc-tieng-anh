ï»¿This story begins before Christmas was a thought.

00:05.848 --> 00:09.424
The story is happy, the beginning is not.

00:11.123 --> 00:13.601
That night, we got reports that there was a forest fire...

00:14.176 --> 00:15.146
...fairly close to town.

00:15.799 --> 00:21.155
I looked out my office window and I saw what was an orange glow.

00:21.587 --> 00:24.770
From the driveway, you could see Wildwood Estates was on fire...

00:25.021 --> 00:26.944
...and all of the hills were on fire.

00:27.325 --> 00:28.954
So, you were just driving in the fire.

00:29.602 --> 00:33.561
The town needed to know that while things may seem rotten,...

00:34.195 --> 00:35.844
...this too shall pass.

00:36.856 --> 00:38.580
They have not been forgotten.

00:44.799 --> 00:45.666
There was food,...

00:45.848 --> 00:46.715
...there was song,...

00:46.953 --> 00:48.950
...so they could all smile and dance.

00:49.842 --> 00:53.985
Christmas could still be merry, it just needed a chance.

01:00.447 --> 01:02.175
The crowd was amazed,...

01:02.356 --> 01:04.136
...a surprise from above!

01:04.649 --> 01:06.467
Special gifts in the sky,...

01:07.250 --> 01:09.677
...tiny boxes of love.

01:15.677 --> 01:19.361
Each gift was a keepsake to remember the night...

01:19.900 --> 01:24.692
...and everyone in every family also got a free flight.
