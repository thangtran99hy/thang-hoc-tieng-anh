00:02.816 --> 00:04.441
ï»¿It's the same story it's always been.

00:09.539 --> 00:13.438
There's the heroes and there's the villains.

00:14.169 --> 00:16.849
In breaking news, the original super team is back.

00:18.293 --> 00:19.737
This is the apocalypse lineup.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.854
They just wanna watch the game burn.

00:23.048 --> 00:23.891
The league is theirs.

00:24.413 --> 00:25.565
And the board is theirs.

00:28.556 --> 00:30.764
But there's always a plot twist.

00:40.005 --> 00:41.053
What's up, jocks?

00:41.191 --> 00:42.662
MonStars again, huh?

00:43.531 --> 00:43.904
Yeah!

00:44.051 --> 00:44.963
Oh brother!

00:45.109 --> 00:47.313
You're gonna need some of these, some of these, a lot of these.

00:47.389 --> 00:49.139
Oh, and one of these!

00:50.876 --> 00:51.831
Blake Griffin!

00:52.308 --> 00:53.880
Who did you expect, Elmer Fudd?

00:53.968 --> 00:55.368
That joke again?

00:55.560 --> 00:57.305
Oh, like you don't say "What's up, Doc" every day.

01:11.383 --> 01:12.493
I hate MonStars.
