ï»¿New York City is one of the most magical places to be during the holidays.

00:04.199 --> 00:06.621
The Rockefeller Center Christmas tree and ice skating rink...

00:06.777 --> 00:09.505
...are two of the most iconic places to see during this time.

00:09.959 --> 00:11.174
Just don't forget to turn around...

00:11.315 --> 00:13.536
...or you'll miss one of my favorite holiday traditions:...

00:13.829 --> 00:15.528
...the Saks Fifth Avenue light show.

00:20.689 --> 00:23.754
Continue along Fifth Avenue for some of the best shopping in the world...

00:23.949 --> 00:25.981
...and take a look at the incredible window displays.

00:26.391 --> 00:30.146
Since Macy's started the Christmas window tradition in the early 1870s,...

00:30.571 --> 00:32.949
...New York City's biggest department stores have unveiled...

00:33.067 --> 00:35.265
...bigger and better window displays every year.

00:36.521 --> 00:38.071
While shopping on Fifth Avenue is great,...

00:38.317 --> 00:40.223
...I prefer to shop at one of the holiday fairs.

00:40.619 --> 00:41.893
Union Square is my favorite.

00:47.322 --> 00:49.007
There's always new treasures to discover...

00:49.104 --> 00:51.193
...from the hundreds of local and national vendors.

00:52.410 --> 00:55.031
Walking through the market always gets me in the Christmas spirit,...

00:56.133 --> 00:59.257
...plus I get to drink hot chocolate and eat crepes while shopping.
