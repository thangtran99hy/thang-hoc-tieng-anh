00:01.969 --> 00:09.110
As visions of sugarplums danced in our heads,...

00:09.458 --> 00:16.680
...out on the roof those reindeer hooves tenderly tread.

00:17.430 --> 00:21.104
I can hear his sleigh jingling on its way.

00:21.201 --> 00:24.093
He has presents for you.

00:24.913 --> 00:26.679
He filled up his sack,...

00:26.837 --> 00:28.551
...threw it on his back.

00:28.657 --> 00:31.455
He has presents for you.

00:32.984 --> 00:36.380
He came in like a Santa Claus,...

00:36.633 --> 00:40.174
...down the chimney like he always does.

00:40.325 --> 00:43.942
Only crumbs left where the cookie was,...

00:44.092 --> 00:48.222
...all he ever did was give gifts to me.

00:49.900 --> 00:52.203
He gives gifts to me.
