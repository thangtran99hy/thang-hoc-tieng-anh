00:08.544 --> 00:11.033
ï»¿This is how Jesus Christ was born.

00:11.825 --> 00:16.480
A young woman named Mary was engaged to Joseph from King David's family.

00:16.967 --> 00:18.125
But before they were married,...

00:18.359 --> 00:21.653
...she learned she was going to have a baby by God's Holy Spirit.

00:22.654 --> 00:26.722
Joseph was a good man and did not want to embarrass Mary in front of everyone,...

00:27.019 --> 00:29.879
...so he decided to quietly call off the wedding.

00:30.272 --> 00:34.743
While Joseph was thinking about this, an angel from the Lord came to him in a dream.

00:35.214 --> 00:40.799
The angel said, "Joseph, the baby that Mary will have is from the Holy Spirit."

00:41.613 --> 00:43.265
"Go ahead and marry her. "

00:43.625 --> 00:47.391
"Then after the baby is born, name him Jesus,..."

00:47.903 --> 00:50.887
"...because he will save his people from their sins."

00:51.459 --> 00:54.892
So the Lord's promise came true, just as the prophet had said,...

00:55.153 --> 00:59.035
"A virgin will have a baby boy, and he will be called Emmanuel,..."

00:59.335 --> 01:01.266
...which means "God is with us."

01:01.909 --> 01:04.986
After Joseph woke up, he and Mary were soon married,...

01:05.209 --> 01:07.637
...just as the Lord's angel had told him to do.
