ï»¿Welcome to Christmas Prague.

00:01.611 --> 00:04.489
This is the famous Christmas market on Old Town Square,...

00:04.705 --> 00:05.715
...but it's very touristy.

00:05.960 --> 00:09.037
So let me first show you some other Christmas markets around Prague.

00:09.234 --> 00:13.892
Christmas markets on Jirak and Mirak are, in general, much cheaper and visited by locals.

00:13.976 --> 00:15.741
You will hardly find a tourist here.

00:15.933 --> 00:19.189
Benefit of the Christmas markets here is that you can find something like this,...

00:19.263 --> 00:21.319
...which is homemade Christmas sweets.

00:21.711 --> 00:23.735
Another Christmas market really close by,...

00:23.825 --> 00:28.529
...just one subway stop, are these on Jiriho Z Podebrad, or we refer to it "Jirak."

00:29.340 --> 00:30.281
They're pretty empty now,...

00:30.489 --> 00:32.939
...but on weekends, there's gonna be a farmer market attached to it.

00:33.065 --> 00:35.766
So if you're here on a weekend, I would come here.

00:35.953 --> 00:40.399
One of the reasons to visit Jirak is also this church by Plecnik.

00:40.563 --> 00:42.144
And we're back on the Old Town Square.

00:42.269 --> 00:44.207
So let me show you what you can buy around here.

00:44.309 --> 00:46.996
Some food like hotdog or gulas soup, so-so.

00:47.277 --> 00:48.713
Hot wine. Yeah!

00:49.238 --> 00:52.593
Roasted chestnuts, so-so.
