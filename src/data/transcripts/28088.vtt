00:01.643 --> 00:06.145
I'm going back to see the place where I come from.

00:07.167 --> 00:11.366
I can't wait to get back there, its been too long.

00:12.491 --> 00:18.772
I'm going back to stay.

00:18.855 --> 00:22.491
Some people tell me that I must be mad...

00:23.898 --> 00:27.417
...to give up what I got for what I had.

00:29.806 --> 00:32.666
I don't know, there ain't no knowing.

00:34.031 --> 00:41.110
But I don't care because I'm going back.

00:49.509 --> 01:00.589
I'm going back to stay.
