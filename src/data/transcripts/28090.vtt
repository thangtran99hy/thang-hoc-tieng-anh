ï»¿Love does not despair.

00:13.711 --> 00:16.381
Love gives us hope that change is possible.

00:31.312 --> 00:32.741
If you take away the labels,...

00:33.257 --> 00:35.993
...you realize that we're far more alike than we are different.

00:43.037 --> 00:43.729
Obama out.

00:44.933 --> 00:46.926
We are the music makers,...

00:47.064 --> 00:49.729
...and we are the dreamers of dreams.

00:58.776 --> 01:04.259
And love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love,...

01:04.466 --> 01:07.295
...cannot be killed or swept aside.

01:07.624 --> 01:10.204
Now, fill the world with music, love and pride.
