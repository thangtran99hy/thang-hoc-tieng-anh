00:03.795 --> 00:04.685
ï»¿Good morning, Jarvis.

00:05.149 --> 00:05.964
Good morning, Mark.

00:06.669 --> 00:09.377
It's Saturday, so you only have five meetings.

00:09.809 --> 00:13.385
Room temperature is set to a cool 68 degrees.

00:13.760 --> 00:16.697
Earlier this year, I started building a simple AI to help run our home.

00:17.216 --> 00:19.161
I talk to Jarvis using this app I built.

00:19.426 --> 00:22.689
It uses artificial intelligence to understand me and figure out what to do.

00:23.540 --> 00:24.947
Max woke up a few minutes ago.

00:25.419 --> 00:26.364
I'm entertaining her.

00:26.659 --> 00:27.828
Alright, let's go check on her.

00:28.122 --> 00:29.113
Good morning, Max.

00:29.335 --> 00:30.856
Let's practice our Mandarin.

00:33.829 --> 00:35.912
Jarvis, your Mandarin is so soothing.

00:38.079 --> 00:39.911
Jarvis also helps me get ready in the morning.

00:40.131 --> 00:40.583
Fresh shirt!

00:40.899 --> 00:41.514
Fire in the hole!

00:44.641 --> 00:45.191
Hell yeah!

00:46.067 --> 00:47.526
Jarvis knows when to make me breakfast.

00:47.604 --> 00:48.900
Your toast is ready.

00:50.055 --> 00:50.625
Alright!

00:51.131 --> 00:52.240
It's time for my call with Schroep.

00:52.493 --> 00:53.801
Can you get him on the video conference line?

00:53.901 --> 00:55.246
Setting up the VC room now.

00:55.493 --> 00:58.874
Remember to check on the AI guidance system for Aquila.

00:59.125 --> 01:02.297
One of the best things about Jarvis is it could recognize people at the gate,...

01:02.605 --> 01:04.651
...let them in automatically and then just tell me about it.

01:05.683 --> 01:07.245
Mark, your parents are coming in.

01:08.055 --> 01:08.981
Thanks, Jeffrey.

01:09.263 --> 01:10.151
It's Jarvis.

01:10.761 --> 01:12.621
And Jarvis can play all of our favorite music.

01:13.174 --> 01:15.112
Hey, play us some good Nickelback songs.

01:15.305 --> 01:16.145
I'm sorry, Mark.

01:16.407 --> 01:17.725
I'm afraid I can't do that.

01:19.321 --> 01:21.228
There are no good Nickelback songs.

01:22.060 --> 01:25.685
And if I don't want to talk, I can just text Jarvis through a messenger bot that I built.
