The focus of five years of fighting in Syria: this is Aleppo.

00:08.187 --> 00:15.173
And so is this, away from the rebel-held zones, at a pool not far from the battlefield,...

00:15.341 --> 00:18.402
...they do their best to drown out the sounds of war.

00:19.984 --> 00:23.787
Those relaxing in this government-controlled part of the divided city...

00:23.874 --> 00:29.935
...can still hear the bombs and see the smoke, yet life and leisure goes on.

00:31.139 --> 00:33.073
Shopping continues too.

00:33.285 --> 00:37.067
We can't stop our lives from the people who are on the other side,...

00:37.771 --> 00:41.240
...but we hope that they get a better life like we did.

00:42.451 --> 00:46.429
Even children who've borne the brunt of this conflict can have fun...

00:46.495 --> 00:50.763
...in a peaceful pocket next door to the apocalyptic scenes...

00:50.843 --> 00:57.869
...that have made Aleppo a symbol of the horror, Syria and most of its people continue to endure.
