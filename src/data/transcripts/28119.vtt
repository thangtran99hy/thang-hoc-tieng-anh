ï»¿It's pretty strange that we keep running into each other.

00:04.517 --> 00:05.241
Maybe it means something.

00:05.496 --> 00:05.906
I doubt it.

00:06.129 --> 00:06.711
Yeah, I don't think so.

00:07.846 --> 00:09.475
You could just write your own roles, you know.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.577
Write something that's as interesting as you are.

00:11.823 --> 00:12.509
What are you gonna do?

00:12.741 --> 00:13.508
Have my own club.

00:16.619 --> 00:17.896
Is that gonna happen every time?

00:18.906 --> 00:19.514
I think so.

00:27.815 --> 00:30.894
How are you gonna be a revolutionary if you're such a traditionalist?

00:31.136 --> 00:34.021
You're holding on to the past, but jazz is about the future.

00:37.299 --> 00:38.095
Maybe I'm not good enough.

00:38.425 --> 00:38.859
Yes, you are.

00:38.967 --> 00:39.530
Maybe I'm not.

00:39.717 --> 00:40.675
It's like a pipe dream.

00:40.959 --> 00:41.811
This is the dream.

00:42.011 --> 00:46.285
It's conflict and it's compromise; it's very, very exciting.
