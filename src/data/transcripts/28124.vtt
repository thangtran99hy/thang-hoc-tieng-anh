ï»¿Hey dad, why do we have to stop here?

00:05.462 --> 00:06.780
I just want to get on the plane.

00:07.186 --> 00:10.583
Well, we have to "stop, screen, go" before we get on the plane.

00:10.881 --> 00:12.282
This is a security checkpoint.

00:12.893 --> 00:17.577
First, we stop here and hand our travel documents to the officer.

00:18.781 --> 00:19.987
She screens it.

00:21.151 --> 00:21.588
Thank you.

00:21.946 --> 00:22.903
Then we go.

00:24.469 --> 00:24.829
Wow!

00:25.095 --> 00:25.763
That was easy.

00:26.312 --> 00:27.073
What's next?

00:27.665 --> 00:28.199
We stop.

00:32.178 --> 00:37.453
Then we put our stuff in the bins and the machine screens it.

00:38.540 --> 00:39.577
Then we go.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.617
Do I need to take off my shoes too?

00:43.024 --> 00:43.337
Nope.

00:43.623 --> 00:45.092
Kids under 12 don't have to,...

00:45.597 --> 00:49.418
...but your game system and Molly's bear need to take a ride.

00:49.581 --> 00:50.659
Do we get our toys back?

00:51.524 --> 00:54.231
Yup, you just need to walk through that rectangle first.

00:54.729 --> 00:55.933
It's a metal detector.

00:56.273 --> 00:58.962
Do we have to "stop, screen, go" here too?

00:59.344 --> 01:00.474
Yep, you got it!

01:00.914 --> 01:03.402
Stop, screen and go!

01:05.505 --> 01:06.249
Are we all done?

01:06.889 --> 01:09.621
Yup, that's what it takes to get ready for takeoff.
