Today, I'm working together with my sponsors, Holiday Inn Express,...

00:04.326 --> 00:06.458
...to show you some of my favorite traveling hacks.

00:07.160 --> 00:09.702
If you're packing shoes, you can wrap them in a shower cap.

00:09.911 --> 00:11.803
This will help stop your clothes from getting dirty.

00:12.343 --> 00:14.844
And if you like, you can drop a couple of tea bags inside...

00:15.100 --> 00:16.347
...to keep them smelling fresh.

00:17.585 --> 00:20.145
A hoodie doubles up as a great laptop protector.

00:20.346 --> 00:23.453
Place your laptop in the middle and fold it over like this.

00:24.041 --> 00:26.753
Tuck it all inside the hood and cross the arms over.

00:27.171 --> 00:30.997
This should fit neatly inside your case and keep your laptop well-protected.

00:32.059 --> 00:34.151
If you're packing for a quick overnight stay,...

00:34.422 --> 00:37.058
...you can fold some underwear and a t-shirt like this,...

00:37.502 --> 00:39.906
...lay some socks on top and roll it all up.

00:40.638 --> 00:43.099
Then fold your socks over and tuck it all in...

00:43.355 --> 00:45.753
...to make a neat, self-contained clothes bundle,...

00:46.059 --> 00:47.887
...which will fit straight into your shoulder bag...

00:48.093 --> 00:49.787
...and is perfect for an overnight stay.
