00:00.417 --> 00:02.620
Fireworks have been around a long time.

00:02.883 --> 00:05.658
Invented in China probably in the second century BC,...

00:06.025 --> 00:08.857
...they were used to celebrate all the important life events.

00:09.447 --> 00:11.799
They became popular in Europe for military victories,...

00:11.966 --> 00:14.360
...then public and religious celebrations.

00:14.552 --> 00:16.753
Eventually, they made it to the United States...

00:16.880 --> 00:22.153
...and were even used at the very first Fourth of July party in 1776.

00:22.270 --> 00:24.489
Originally, fireworks were made from black powder...

00:24.615 --> 00:27.269
...stuffed into bamboo shoots and thrown into fire.

00:27.562 --> 00:28.988
They've changed a bit since then,...

00:29.247 --> 00:33.189
...but they are still a crucial part of any grand celebration.
