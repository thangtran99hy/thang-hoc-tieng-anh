You know that song you hear every New Year's Eve?

00:03.616 --> 00:05.686
The one no one ever seems to get the words right?

00:06.317 --> 00:11.537
"For Old Aunt of Mine", "For Old Ang Zing", "Please Hold My Sign."

00:12.295 --> 00:15.225
Well, actually the words are really "For Auld Lang Syne."

00:15.852 --> 00:18.830
We sing it every year, but do you know what it really means?

00:19.567 --> 00:24.625
"For Auld Lang Syne" is a Scottish folk song originally transcribed by Robert Burns in the 1700s.

00:25.061 --> 00:29.270
Now, a good translation for the phrase "Auld Lang Syne" means "Times Gone By."

00:29.898 --> 00:33.878
It's sung as a remembrance of the past as we look towards a bright, new tomorrow.

00:34.087 --> 00:35.643
Happy New Year!

00:35.795 --> 00:40.069
So, at the end of the night, when you warm up your vocal cords to belt out this song,...

00:40.610 --> 00:43.196
...think of your friends, your family and acquaintances,...

00:43.637 --> 00:47.825
...let go of the bad and be thankful for the people who've touched your life and made it better.

00:48.738 --> 00:51.916
So, grab a hand and raise a glass for "Auld Lang Syne."
