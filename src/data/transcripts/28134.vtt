ï»¿At the Circle, there isn't a problem that we cannot solve.

00:04.051 --> 00:07.337
We can cure any disease and we can end hunger.

00:08.412 --> 00:12.055
Without secrets, without the hoarding of knowledge and information,...

00:13.277 --> 00:15.356
...we can finally realize our potential.

00:16.036 --> 00:18.202
Circlers, do you like to share?

00:18.654 --> 00:20.495
Sharing is caring!

00:24.381 --> 00:25.307
We will see it all.

00:27.042 --> 00:29.132
If it happens, we all know.

00:31.083 --> 00:33.460
Imagine the human rights implications.

00:35.431 --> 00:36.985
There needs to be accountability.

00:37.934 --> 00:39.014
What is this?

00:39.583 --> 00:42.263
The Circle has the power to change everything.

00:43.047 --> 00:44.673
It's only our lies that get us in trouble,...

00:45.539 --> 00:46.381
...things we hide.

00:47.367 --> 00:49.376
We care about everybody you care about...

00:50.421 --> 00:52.441
...because knowing is good.

00:53.089 --> 00:57.753
But knowing everything is better.
