I have a problem with New Year's resolutions,...

00:03.743 --> 00:08.604
...not because they often fail or because they're too difficult,...

00:08.785 --> 00:10.955
...and not because I'm bad at them either.

00:11.087 --> 00:14.526
I mean, I've only been alive for four New Year's!

00:14.680 --> 00:20.822
No, I have a problem with resolutions because people think that that's it.

00:21.067 --> 00:23.833
It's the one time to change.

00:24.258 --> 00:29.130
Now, don't get me wrong, we definitely all need change.

00:29.420 --> 00:32.381
I have no idea how to ride a bicycle,...

00:32.486 --> 00:36.771
...and my little brother has no idea what a toilet is for.

00:37.905 --> 00:42.812
And some of you, yeah, you should probably get out of the house more,...

00:42.964 --> 00:47.156
...but one big decision probably isn't going to do it.

00:47.408 --> 00:48.149
Sorry!

00:48.499 --> 00:49.935
So, now what?

00:50.234 --> 00:52.940
Flush your resolutions down the toilet?

00:53.181 --> 00:55.607
The one my little brother can't use?

00:56.319 --> 00:57.448
Of course not!

00:57.600 --> 01:01.527
Keep your resolutions but go easy on yourself.

01:01.767 --> 01:02.836
Will you change?

01:03.175 --> 01:03.882
Maybe.

01:04.106 --> 01:07.241
But it probably won't happen in one big moment.

01:07.339 --> 01:11.406
It'll happen in thousands of little moments.
