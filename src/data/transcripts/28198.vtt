ï»¿Mark.

00:06.989 --> 00:08.156
Yes, hi.

00:08.436 --> 00:09.602
Do you know why I'm upset with you right now?

00:10.114 --> 00:10.239
No.

00:10.434 --> 00:13.414
I've told you a million times to refill the roll when it's done...

00:13.701 --> 00:15.471
...and put the toilet seat back down.

00:15.940 --> 00:17.165
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:18.826 --> 00:20.844
Step one: conflict resolution.

00:21.233 --> 00:22.541
Do it in a way they understand.

00:24.077 --> 00:27.832
Mark, when you don't refill the roll, it's like you left me with no extra ammo,...

00:28.007 --> 00:29.349
...knowing I'm on my last bit of health.

00:29.708 --> 00:32.318
I am so sorry, I did not mean to kill you.

00:32.491 --> 00:35.208
I will replace the toilet paper and I'll put the seat down.

00:36.125 --> 00:36.546
Thank you.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.359
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to fire off some shots.

00:39.877 --> 00:41.673
Oh, are you gonna play while you're on the toilet again?

00:42.868 --> 00:43.057
No.

00:44.027 --> 00:44.781
I had Mexican again.

00:46.829 --> 00:47.599
Can I play with you?

00:49.139 --> 00:49.535
Sure.

00:51.991 --> 00:53.560
So, wait, I just use this move?

00:54.904 --> 00:57.066
Yeah, but don't worry, I'll go easy on ya.

00:59.442 --> 01:00.978
Seems pretty simple, to be honest.

01:02.273 --> 01:03.229
It's not that simple.

01:03.943 --> 01:04.997
I'm doing pretty good, actually.

01:05.082 --> 01:06.089
Well, maybe...

01:06.356 --> 01:08.299
Oh look at me, I'm like, killing you.

01:08.423 --> 01:09.230
Okay, calm down a little bit.

01:09.390 --> 01:10.341
Like, you're dying.

01:10.427 --> 01:10.761
Hang on.

01:10.831 --> 01:13.700
I am destroying you right, this is easy.

01:13.810 --> 01:15.228
I am going super easy on you.

01:15.293 --> 01:16.608
My God, this is what you do all day?

01:17.136 --> 01:17.853
Oh my God!
