00:00.743 --> 00:03.634
ï»¿Something big is coming to Pen Gu island.

00:03.777 --> 00:06.545
Never give up on being awesome!

00:06.669 --> 00:07.631
Gnarly!

00:08.213 --> 00:11.048
Put them together for the Hang Five:...

00:11.153 --> 00:15.325
...the most extreme team, surfing the Earth and living the dream.

00:15.457 --> 00:16.148
They're here!

00:16.279 --> 00:18.022
Wow, the Hang Five!

00:18.157 --> 00:19.773
Seeing them surf made me who I am today.

00:19.895 --> 00:20.975
What's up, little dudes?

00:24.493 --> 00:26.115
You're the awesomest!

00:27.384 --> 00:31.013
From Sony Pictures Animation and WWE Studios:...

00:31.521 --> 00:38.887
JC, Undertaker, Hunter, Paige and Mr. McMahon...

00:39.143 --> 00:42.154
...are putting Cody and his friends to the ultimate test.

00:42.395 --> 00:46.099
This is the map to the most legendary surfing spot on the planet.

00:46.197 --> 00:47.951
It's a surfer's graveyard.

00:48.586 --> 00:50.955
To ride the most dangerous waves on Earth.

00:51.090 --> 00:52.362
You gotta do more than surf it.

00:52.463 --> 00:53.544
You gotta survive it.

00:53.937 --> 00:57.241
This is my one big chance to get off Pen Gu and make something of myself.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.677
They're taking them under their wings.

01:00.803 --> 01:03.787
If you wipe out up here, you'll be a bucket of extra crispy.

01:03.884 --> 01:05.336
Whoa man, don't eat me.

01:05.438 --> 01:06.655
I'm not the food.

01:07.226 --> 01:09.343
To help them overcome their fears.

01:09.599 --> 01:10.499
I can't watch.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.568
This is the moment we've been waiting for.

01:12.695 --> 01:13.301
Hold on!

01:13.387 --> 01:15.434
And discover the meaning of teamwork.

01:15.703 --> 01:17.695
We have each other's back, no matter what.

01:18.335 --> 01:20.569
