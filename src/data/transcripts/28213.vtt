When Jeni Stepien walked down the aisle this weekend in Swissvale, Pennsylvania,...

00:05.946 --> 00:08.650
"It has been the best day of my life."

00:08.857 --> 00:11.347
...the man whose arm she held was not her father.

00:11.669 --> 00:16.791
That would not have been possible because her dad Michael was gone 10 years already,...

00:17.079 --> 00:19.443
...snatched from his little girl's life in a murder.

00:20.027 --> 00:22.201
So, who was this person walking by her side?

00:22.299 --> 00:25.699
On your right you're gonna see a parking lot, my aunt's wearing white pants and...

00:25.809 --> 00:28.871
A person she would not even meet until the day before the wedding,...

00:29.011 --> 00:31.017
...when she had to talk him through the route to the church.

00:31.595 --> 00:35.263
Well, ten years ago, Arthur Thomas was in urgent need of a new heart.

00:35.402 --> 00:36.843
I was on death's door.

00:37.039 --> 00:40.297
And the heart they gave him was Michael's, Jenny's dad's.

00:40.809 --> 00:43.666
Jenny grew up knowing a living part of her father was out there.

00:43.777 --> 00:48.363
We've been talking to him and writing letters and calling.

00:48.436 --> 00:50.413
But it was all long distance until...

00:50.513 --> 00:51.381
Jenny wrote me a letter...

00:52.011 --> 00:54.936
...and she said, "If you're willing, would you walk me down the aisle?"

00:55.279 --> 00:57.110
Thank you so much for coming.

00:57.438 --> 00:58.132
Are you kidding?

01:00.533 --> 01:02.896
And so, there they were in the moment of their meeting,...

01:03.193 --> 01:06.243
...Jenny closer to her dad's beating heart than she had been in years.

01:06.719 --> 01:08.641
So close, she reached to feel that beat.

01:09.261 --> 01:14.051
And on this, her wedding day, that was possible.

01:15.288 --> 01:16.579
