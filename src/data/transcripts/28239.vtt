00:07.091 --> 00:10.738
After witnessing the "violent rage" shown by babies...

00:10.967 --> 00:14.185
...whenever deprived of an item they considered their own,...

00:14.499 --> 00:18.162
...Jean Piaget, a founding father of child psychology,...

00:18.508 --> 00:21.350
...observed something profound about human nature:...

00:22.064 --> 00:25.631
...our sense of ownership emerges incredibly early.

00:26.353 --> 00:27.881
Why are we so clingy?

00:28.433 --> 00:33.313
There's a well-established phenomenon in psychology known as the endowment effect,...

00:33.537 --> 00:37.843
...where we value items much more highly just as soon as we own them.

00:38.726 --> 00:41.946
Part of this has to do with how quickly we form connections...

00:42.189 --> 00:45.801
...between our sense of self and the things we consider ours.

00:46.205 --> 00:48.555
That can even be seen at the neural level.

00:49.269 --> 00:53.084
In one experiment, neuroscientists scanned participants' brains...

00:53.313 --> 00:55.406
...while they allocated various objects...

00:55.701 --> 01:00.250
...either to a basket labeled "Mine" or another labeled "Alex's."

01:00.755 --> 01:03.659
When participants subsequently looked at their new things,...

01:04.028 --> 01:08.609
...their brains showed more activity in a region that usually flickers into life...

01:08.929 --> 01:10.833
...whenever we think about ourselves.

01:11.841 --> 01:13.455
What remains to be seen today...

01:13.681 --> 01:16.345
...is how the nature of our relationship with our possessions...

01:16.470 --> 01:19.321
...will change with the rise of digital technologies.

01:19.679 --> 01:23.263
Many have forecast the demise of physical books and music,...

01:23.535 --> 01:25.971
...but for now at least, this seems premature.

01:26.465 --> 01:29.434
Perhaps there will always be something uniquely satisfying...

01:29.717 --> 01:33.519
...about holding an object in our hands and calling it our own.
