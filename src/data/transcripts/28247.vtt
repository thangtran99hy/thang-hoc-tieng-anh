00:00.228 --> 00:03.131
ï»¿Being your First Lady has been the greatest honor of my life,...

00:03.934 --> 00:05.298
...and I hope I've made you proud.

00:09.709 --> 00:13.600
For all the young people in this room and those who are watching,...

00:14.725 --> 00:19.018
...know that this country belongs to you, to all of you.

00:19.937 --> 00:23.040
Do not ever let anyone make you feel like you don't matter...

00:23.790 --> 00:28.182
...or like you don't have a place in our American story because you do.

00:28.921 --> 00:33.011
And when you encounter obstacles, because I guarantee you you will,...

00:33.700 --> 00:35.693
...and many of you already have,...

00:36.992 --> 00:41.302
...when you are struggling and you start thinking about giving up,...

00:42.569 --> 00:46.572
...I want you to remember something that my husband and I have talked about...

00:46.939 --> 00:50.089
...since we first started this journey nearly a decade ago.

00:51.557 --> 00:56.070
Something that has carried us through every moment in this White House...

00:56.161 --> 01:00.955
...and every moment of our lives, and that is the power of hope.

01:02.819 --> 01:06.636
The belief that something better is always possible...

01:06.703 --> 01:09.137
...if you're willing to work for it and fight for it.

01:09.501 --> 01:12.221
Because that is what moves this country forward every single day.

01:13.510 --> 01:17.225
Our hope for the future and the hard work that hope inspires.
