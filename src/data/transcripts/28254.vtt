The letter showed up in my mailbox with no tracks in the snow.

00:04.725 --> 00:06.534
You're not thinking about going back there, are you?

00:06.649 --> 00:07.699
I gotta do something.

00:07.828 --> 00:09.408
You know this is not a good idea.

00:09.590 --> 00:10.244
It's crazy,...

00:10.403 --> 00:11.493
...but this is all I got.

00:12.285 --> 00:17.430
Mackenzie Allen Phillips, I am looking forward to this.

00:17.595 --> 00:18.349
Do I know you?

00:18.513 --> 00:20.979
Not very well but we're gonna work on that.

00:22.462 --> 00:23.577
This is incredible.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.973
He's still having a hard time believing this is real.

00:26.163 --> 00:27.455
Why did you bring me here?

00:27.697 --> 00:29.996
There's no easy answer that'll take your pain away.

00:30.457 --> 00:32.271
Where were you when I needed you?

00:32.403 --> 00:33.303
I never left you.

00:33.427 --> 00:34.720
I never left Missy.

00:38.520 --> 00:39.753
You want me to forgive him.

00:39.913 --> 00:42.553
I want him to hurt like he hurt me.

00:43.683 --> 00:45.877
You want the promise of a pain-free life.

00:46.241 --> 00:46.930
Yes.

00:47.121 --> 00:48.145
There isn't one.

00:49.868 --> 00:50.839
You can do this.

00:51.028 --> 00:51.621
I can't.

00:51.794 --> 00:52.981
Not on your own, you can't.

00:53.492 --> 00:55.070
This is your flying lesson.

01:08.950 --> 01:10.209
I believe you.
