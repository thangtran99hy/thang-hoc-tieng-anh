00:00.909 --> 00:02.416
Where can I take you tonight, ma'am?

00:02.751 --> 00:04.787
175 Springer Lane please.

00:05.258 --> 00:05.895
You got it.

00:06.858 --> 00:08.062
How about this weather?

00:08.460 --> 00:10.163
It's really cold outside.

00:10.877 --> 00:13.656
Are you warm enough or do I need to turn up the heater?

00:14.001 --> 00:18.271
Oh no, I'm fine, but it's much colder here than I thought it would be.

00:18.581 --> 00:20.347
Oh, are you from out of town?

00:20.833 --> 00:24.997
Yes. It's much warmer where I'm from compared to Boston.

00:25.435 --> 00:26.472
That sounds nice.

00:26.908 --> 00:29.025
I can't wait for it to warm up here.

00:29.805 --> 00:30.600
Where are you from?

00:30.852 --> 00:31.918
I live in Atlanta.

00:32.295 --> 00:33.920
I've been there a couple of times.

00:34.367 --> 00:35.700
It is much warmer there.

00:36.299 --> 00:40.040
Hey, didn't the Braves just win the National League Division Series?

00:40.343 --> 00:43.875
Yes, they did, although the Dodgers didn't make it easy for them.

00:44.297 --> 00:47.676
I'm not a baseball fan so I didn't watch any of the games.

00:48.203 --> 00:49.909
But I heard it was real close.

00:50.279 --> 00:54.643
It was but luckily the Braves came through in the last game.
