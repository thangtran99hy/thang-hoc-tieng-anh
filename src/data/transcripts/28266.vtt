ï»¿The problem with shopping for strollers...

00:03.510 --> 00:05.909
...is that babies can't talk to tell you what they like.

00:06.859 --> 00:09.123
How are the ergonomics in the stroller?

00:12.208 --> 00:15.029
And an adult certainly can't fit into a baby stroller.

00:16.264 --> 00:20.013
Feels like a smooth ride, but that's all speculation, right?

00:20.101 --> 00:21.321
You don't know 'cause you're not the baby.

00:21.685 --> 00:22.033
I know.

00:22.091 --> 00:23.451
You're not a baby in a stroller.

00:23.600 --> 00:23.783
Right.

00:24.399 --> 00:29.182
We created an exact, adult-size replica of one of our best-selling baby strollers...

00:29.492 --> 00:31.033
...and invited parents to try it,...

00:31.620 --> 00:34.997
...showing just how comfortable Contours strollers are for babies.

00:35.411 --> 00:35.983
Cozy, right?

00:36.097 --> 00:36.961
Yeah, it's very cozy.

00:37.393 --> 00:38.120
It's very comfortable.

00:38.799 --> 00:39.452
I love it.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.315
How's it feel in there, comfortable?

00:42.690 --> 00:44.955
It's very comfortable, yeah, it's cozy.

00:47.078 --> 00:49.014
How's it feel in there, comfortable?

00:49.643 --> 00:53.033
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

00:53.579 --> 00:54.436
That's really nice.

00:54.575 --> 00:55.829
Are you getting more comforted?

00:55.954 --> 00:56.322
I am.

00:57.805 --> 00:58.801
Here comes some sun.

00:59.564 --> 01:01.733
Ooh, that's the sun!

01:01.837 --> 01:02.788
Peekaboo!
