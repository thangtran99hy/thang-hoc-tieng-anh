00:00.592 --> 00:01.645
ï»¿Have you seen that girl...

00:01.971 --> 00:03.501
...who's been fishing around in our trash?

00:04.259 --> 00:05.679
If you see her, can you help her?

00:05.811 --> 00:06.289
Yeah I promise.

00:06.413 --> 00:07.161
Hey, have you seen my...

00:07.220 --> 00:07.595
Henry.

00:07.880 --> 00:08.053
What?

00:08.573 --> 00:09.228
Promise me now.

00:09.585 --> 00:10.165
I promise.

00:14.409 --> 00:14.588
Hey!

00:15.319 --> 00:17.402
Don't you know no better than to be sneaking up on people?

00:17.830 --> 00:18.552
What's with all of the junk?

00:19.045 --> 00:19.652
I'm building something.

00:19.781 --> 00:20.119
Oh yeah?

00:20.629 --> 00:22.257
I'm an architect you know, maybe I could...

00:22.477 --> 00:25.336
You're not one of them pervs who likes to touch little girls, are you?

00:26.197 --> 00:27.121
You torched my shed!

00:27.343 --> 00:28.256
That was an accident.

00:28.347 --> 00:30.010
Do you have any idea how long it took me to...

00:30.095 --> 00:30.889
What? Build a raft?

00:31.100 --> 00:32.089
I have your plans right here.

00:32.270 --> 00:33.134
I've got a ton of ideas.

00:33.388 --> 00:35.516
I really think I'm supposed to do this, to help you.

00:37.957 --> 00:38.927
Let's get one thing clear:...

00:39.331 --> 00:40.688
...I'm doing it 'cause I got no choice.

00:40.997 --> 00:43.499
And if you mess with my stuff, I'll beat your ass.

00:45.029 --> 00:45.867
I'm helping her.

00:46.053 --> 00:47.184
Helping her with what?

00:47.443 --> 00:48.396
We're building a raft.

00:48.651 --> 00:49.709
This is madness.

00:49.823 --> 00:50.787
No, it's not!

00:51.033 --> 00:52.152
And Penny would have loved this.

00:57.117 --> 00:57.810
Those are pontoons.

00:57.967 --> 00:59.766
Should we just wait 'til the tide washes them in?

01:01.443 --> 01:02.169
What was she like?

01:02.284 --> 01:03.494
She was kind of wild.

01:03.701 --> 01:04.461
Like a hurricane?

01:16.400 --> 01:19.066
We ain't lost our minds, we just lost our way a little bit.
