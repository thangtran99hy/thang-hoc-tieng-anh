ï»¿It's the 1940s.

00:01.985 --> 00:03.125
The world is at war.

00:03.393 --> 00:05.344
And for the first time in American history,...

00:05.765 --> 00:08.741
...women are joining the full-time workforce in droves.

00:10.267 --> 00:12.491
An organic chemist by the name of Hazel Bishop...

00:12.654 --> 00:16.221
...is in the midst of designing aircraft fuel for different oil companies.

00:17.088 --> 00:18.961
But her true interests lie elsewhere.

00:20.089 --> 00:21.836
The influx of women in the workforce...

00:21.938 --> 00:24.715
...hasn't changed the superficial expectations of society...

00:24.973 --> 00:28.761
...and working women are expected to look well-groomed no matter their trade.

00:30.276 --> 00:34.703
Bishop is sick of having to take time to powder her nose and reapply her lipstick.

00:35.523 --> 00:38.757
Bishop spends her spare time working with stains and dyes,...

00:38.881 --> 00:42.123
...mixing oils and experimenting with molten wax.

00:43.519 --> 00:46.685
In a moment of vision and after years of hard work,...

00:47.523 --> 00:50.475
...Bishop introduces one of the first smudge-proof,...

00:50.629 --> 00:55.073
...long-lasting working woman's lipsticks that doesn't just tint the lips...

00:55.359 --> 00:57.764
...but also keeps them healthy and moisturized.

00:59.057 --> 01:03.379
Marketed as the only kissable lipstick, Bishop's product takes off.

01:03.844 --> 01:07.845
And it isn't long before rival companies are not just replicating the lipstick...

01:08.181 --> 01:11.133
...but creating other, more practical cosmetics.

01:13.167 --> 01:17.501
Today, lip cosmetics are a billion-dollar industry.
