00:03.421 --> 00:04.927
When tomorrow comes,...

00:05.022 --> 00:06.084
...I'll be on my own,...

00:06.557 --> 00:07.629
...feeling frightened of...

00:07.951 --> 00:09.507
...the things that I don't know.

00:09.671 --> 00:11.283
When tomorrow comes,...

00:11.418 --> 00:12.777
...tomorrow comes,...

00:12.994 --> 00:15.239
...tomorrow comes.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.172
And though the road is long,...

00:17.256 --> 00:18.845
...I look up to the sky.

00:19.025 --> 00:22.027
In the dark, I found lost hope that I won't fly.

00:22.161 --> 00:28.159
And I sing along, I sing along, and I sing along.

00:28.591 --> 00:31.250
I got all I need when I got you and I.

00:31.449 --> 00:34.546
I look around me and see a sweet life.

00:34.854 --> 00:37.655
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight.

00:37.893 --> 00:41.137
You're getting me, getting me through the night.

00:41.225 --> 00:44.257
Kickstart my heart when you shine it in my eyes.

00:44.581 --> 00:47.069
Can't lie, it's a sweet life.

00:47.310 --> 00:49.891
Stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight.

00:50.342 --> 00:54.310
You're getting me, getting me through the night.

00:54.704 --> 00:56.809
'Cause you're my flashlight.

00:57.754 --> 01:04.753
You're my flashlight, you're my flashlight.
