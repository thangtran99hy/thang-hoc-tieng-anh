ï»¿My dad used to love your TV show.

00:02.129 --> 00:03.235
We've watched every episode.

00:03.463 --> 00:04.567
Always nice to meet a fan.

00:04.781 --> 00:06.028
Well, we just had the one TV.

00:08.221 --> 00:09.819
This is the worst day ever.

00:09.994 --> 00:10.885
It's just a bunch of olives.

00:11.238 --> 00:12.633
Hey look, are you free tonight?

00:12.845 --> 00:13.671
What, like a date?

00:13.746 --> 00:15.167
Or it'll be just an appointment.

00:15.227 --> 00:17.506
I'm not sleeping with you, I don't know what you are after.

00:17.608 --> 00:19.399
Look, you had a terrible day, you just said it.

00:19.886 --> 00:21.787
Let me take you to a place you might have a nice time.

00:23.175 --> 00:26.305
Isn't it adorable when celebrities bring their hookers to the club?

00:26.904 --> 00:28.260
Jackie Burke's in the crowd!

00:28.433 --> 00:29.723
After everything I've done for you...

00:29.782 --> 00:32.102
...I was there for you when you were starting out as a young man.

00:33.549 --> 00:35.619
That was amazing, I feel like I'm high!

00:35.844 --> 00:37.293
Do you come up with all that on the spot?

00:37.680 --> 00:38.597
Hmm... Sometimes, yeah.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.109
That was good, thank you.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.769
I wanna know what your expectations are here.

00:45.842 --> 00:46.769
My expectations?

00:46.875 --> 00:49.267
When you look at my daughter and the way she's looking at you...

00:49.607 --> 00:51.327
I'm not looking at him, what are you talking about?

00:54.246 --> 00:55.888
You have three offers for appearances.

00:56.129 --> 00:56.611
What's it gonna be?

00:56.882 --> 00:58.641
Go out there, big shot. They want you.

00:58.854 --> 01:00.016
No, this isn't your crowd.

01:00.195 --> 01:00.861
You're a dancer?

01:01.007 --> 01:01.152
Yeah.

01:02.597 --> 01:06.609
You're viral again, over three million views in eight hours and it is still climbing.

01:06.696 --> 01:08.522
You are on Kimmel, you're on Fallon.

01:09.679 --> 01:11.641
Ladies and gentlemen, Jackie Burke.
