ï»¿Loving can hurt.

00:09.121 --> 00:11.875
Loving can hurt sometimes.

00:13.632 --> 00:18.315
But it's the only thing that I know.

00:22.446 --> 00:25.991
And when it gets hard,...

00:26.412 --> 00:29.587
...you know it can get hard sometimes,...

00:31.409 --> 00:36.901
...it is the only thing that makes us feel alive.

00:41.633 --> 00:44.363
We keep this love in a photograph.

00:46.134 --> 00:49.565
We made these memories for ourselves,...

00:49.737 --> 00:54.069
...where our eyes are never closing, our hearts are never broken,...

00:54.411 --> 00:57.212
...time's forever frozen still.

00:58.187 --> 01:05.419
So, you can keep me inside the pocket of your ripped jeans,...

01:05.847 --> 01:09.499
...holding me closer 'til our eyes meet.

01:10.245 --> 01:13.940
You won't ever be alone.

01:14.679 --> 01:16.977
Wait for me to come home.
