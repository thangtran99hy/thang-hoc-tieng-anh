00:00.683 --> 00:02.540
So, give me a callback at your earliest convenience...

00:02.829 --> 00:03.808
...as I'd love to set something up.

00:04.264 --> 00:05.489
I think we would be of great help to you.

00:06.687 --> 00:07.559
Okay, talk soon.

00:07.950 --> 00:08.945
Thanks. Bye.

00:09.826 --> 00:10.597
Here we go.

00:11.629 --> 00:13.387
How is your morning shaping up so far?

00:14.423 --> 00:16.428
Great. Have some pretty solid leads.

00:16.961 --> 00:19.849
Been working on some clients that I met at the Rosenberg mixer last week.

00:20.237 --> 00:21.515
They seem pretty promising.

00:21.827 --> 00:22.444
Well, that's just great.

00:23.017 --> 00:25.143
You know, I think this is gonna be a fantastic new venture for us.

00:25.613 --> 00:26.920
I was reading in the Journal this morning...

00:27.043 --> 00:29.476
...how the government put 16 thousand new agents out...

00:29.564 --> 00:31.996
...just to enforce this one single piece of legislature.

00:32.701 --> 00:35.792
So, I'd say that the harvest is gonna be pretty plentiful.

00:36.328 --> 00:37.657
Sounds like dollar signs to me.

00:38.702 --> 00:39.688
Any new business on your end?

00:40.177 --> 00:41.526
I've been doing some innovative marketing...

00:41.627 --> 00:43.487
...in some of the local businesses in the area...

00:43.557 --> 00:45.638
...and, I gotta tell you, I think I've turned a few heads.

00:46.150 --> 00:46.893
Guerrilla-style marketing.

00:47.403 --> 00:47.754
Nice.

00:48.303 --> 00:48.927
Always effective.

00:50.083 --> 00:52.774
Plus with this new software, I think this'll be a great season.

00:53.199 --> 00:53.775
You know, I think you're right.

00:55.882 --> 00:56.477
So now we just...

00:57.970 --> 00:58.805
I guess we just wait, huh?
