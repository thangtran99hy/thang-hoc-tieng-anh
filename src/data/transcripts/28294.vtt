Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, girl of the South Side,...

00:16.188 --> 00:21.429
...for the past 25 years, you have not only been my wife and mother of my children,...

00:21.548 --> 00:22.636
...you have been my best friend.

00:32.358 --> 00:37.103
You took on a role you didn't ask for and you made it your own...

00:38.117 --> 00:42.110
...with grace and with grit and with style and good humor.

00:47.993 --> 00:50.410
You made the White House a place that belongs to everybody,...

00:51.864 --> 00:56.591
...and a new generation sets its sights higher because it has you as a role model.

00:58.417 --> 01:03.131
So, you have made me proud and you have made the country proud.
