00:00.517 --> 00:02.278
ï»¿And that's how I do it.

00:02.599 --> 00:05.420
That's how I do my "night look" for going out for dinner...

00:05.743 --> 00:07.693
...'cause dinner would be nice every now and then.

00:07.788 --> 00:08.605
Ugh, not again.

00:08.719 --> 00:09.671
No, you know what?

00:10.030 --> 00:11.588
It would be nice just to go out to dinner.

00:11.655 --> 00:14.853
Maybe you could pretend like you like having me around.

00:15.154 --> 00:17.162
No, that's okay, you can just keep texting...

00:17.225 --> 00:17.875
How did you get my phone?

00:17.995 --> 00:18.404
Who is this?

00:18.463 --> 00:18.998
What are you doing on my phone?

00:19.060 --> 00:19.444
Tina?

00:19.901 --> 00:21.754
"Oh, I miss you, too."

00:21.827 --> 00:25.048
Why are you missing Tina at 10 PM at night time?

00:25.531 --> 00:26.669
That's a bit weird.

00:26.901 --> 00:29.774
So, following on from my "What I Eat in a Day" video,...

00:30.119 --> 00:31.715
...I thought I would focus on dinners...

00:32.148 --> 00:35.562
...and tonight's dinner was a homemade vegan pesto pasta.

00:35.707 --> 00:39.053
But tonight, mine was kind of cold because I made it for dinner...

00:39.331 --> 00:43.628
...but somebody didn't get home 'til 9:30 even though he finished work at five...

00:43.685 --> 00:44.148
I was in a meeting.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.899
...and no one at work knew where he was 'cause I called.

00:46.959 --> 00:47.865
It was an outside meeting!

00:47.954 --> 00:49.367
You reek of perfume!
