00:00.213 --> 00:02.246
Have you ever been just about to go to sleep,...

00:02.433 --> 00:03.795
...walking through the gates to dream land,...

00:03.926 --> 00:06.742
...only to have the floor pulled out from under you and suddenly, you're falling...

00:06.812 --> 00:07.753
...and then, you wake up.

00:08.713 --> 00:13.953
These frustrating sleep starts have another cool medical name, hypnagogic myoclonus.

00:14.303 --> 00:17.334
When we drift off, the areas of our brain that control motor function...

00:17.416 --> 00:20.658
...are inactivated in favor of those that control our sleep cycles,...

00:20.910 --> 00:23.861
...which is why you can dream about riding your bike without actually moving your feet.

00:24.475 --> 00:28.083
As the sleepy part of your brain fights with the awake and moving parts of your brain,...

00:28.177 --> 00:32.038
...that battle can spontaneously tip back in favor of the motor control side...

00:32.213 --> 00:35.137
...and then suddenly you're like, "Whoa, I'm awake."

00:35.508 --> 00:39.140
Sleep starts aren't the only myocloni that we experience.

00:40.660 --> 00:43.305
Hiccups are an uncontrollable contraction of the diaphragm muscle...

00:43.390 --> 00:45.185
...that we use to draw air into our lungs.

00:45.551 --> 00:49.175
About a quarter second after that muscle contracts, the vocal cords snap shut,...

00:49.344 --> 00:50.743
...creating that characteristic "Hic!"

00:51.360 --> 00:54.983
Scientists still aren't sure what causes them, but possible explanations include...

00:55.104 --> 00:58.505
...hiccups being an evolutionary remnant from a few hundred million years ago,...

00:58.788 --> 01:01.413
...when our ancestors still had to pump water over their gills.

01:02.681 --> 01:04.590
Or, since hiccups mainly happen in mammals,...

01:04.666 --> 01:08.203
...that they started as a way for nursing infants to clear air from their stomachs.
