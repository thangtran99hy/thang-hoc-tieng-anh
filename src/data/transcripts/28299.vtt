ï»¿Love.

00:02.634 --> 00:03.035
Rage.

00:05.036 --> 00:05.341
Fear.

00:07.030 --> 00:09.825
The grip of a strong emotion can seem to crush all reason.

00:10.629 --> 00:14.023
So, are we doomed to be ruled by whatever feeling is strongest at the moment?

00:19.407 --> 00:22.476
Some ancient philosophers feared that that might be the case.

00:22.849 --> 00:26.348
Plato thought love made people act like insane slaves.

00:27.441 --> 00:30.425
The Greeks thought emotions need to be trained and directed by reason...

00:30.830 --> 00:31.953
...in order to free the mind.

00:32.453 --> 00:37.039
But 17th century philosopher Baruch Spinoza thought having the right emotions at the right time...

00:37.107 --> 00:38.745
...could help drive us to our goals.

00:39.351 --> 00:43.157
Emotions could be a way of linking our desire to survive...

00:43.480 --> 00:45.623
...with behaviors that make sure that we do.

00:46.808 --> 00:50.819
Today, psychologists agree with Spinoza and believe that emotions are middlemen...

00:51.111 --> 00:52.883
...between motivations and behavior.

00:53.113 --> 00:55.134
But emotions don't turn humans into puppets.

00:55.785 --> 00:58.911
We have a much more developed neocortex than apes and other animals,...

00:59.195 --> 01:01.765
...which is thought to let us experience more complex emotions.

01:02.515 --> 01:05.019
It also lets us suppress an impulse when we want to.

01:05.393 --> 01:09.829
For example, we can delay gratification if we think we'll get a bigger reward later.

01:11.464 --> 01:14.705
Our research investigates how emotions and behavior interact...

01:15.100 --> 01:18.595
...because when you're overcome by an emotion, you do feel like a bit of a puppet.
