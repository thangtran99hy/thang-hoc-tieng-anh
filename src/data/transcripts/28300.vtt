ï»¿What is it?

00:02.771 --> 00:04.768
Oh, it's a board with different feelings on it.

00:04.849 --> 00:06.538
You know, happy, sad, irritated...

00:06.825 --> 00:09.285
...and then I put pictures of all of us from around the office...

00:09.409 --> 00:11.298
...so that we could show each other how we're feeling.

00:12.803 --> 00:13.233
Great.

00:15.042 --> 00:16.267
Why am I on "worthless"?

00:18.323 --> 00:20.499
Let's see, my face is on "happy."

00:20.705 --> 00:21.941
So, where do you want to put yours?

00:22.051 --> 00:22.710
You can change it.

00:23.309 --> 00:25.877
Do you have one that says "bored" of this conversation?

00:27.289 --> 00:27.822
Oh, you do.

00:32.551 --> 00:34.133
I'm moving mine to "sad" now.

00:35.218 --> 00:36.697
So, that report that I wanted you to do...

00:36.807 --> 00:38.499
Oh! Hey James, do you want to see my feelings board?

00:38.598 --> 00:39.159
I just made it.

00:39.541 --> 00:42.545
Wendy, I have important things to do.

00:44.283 --> 00:45.867
I'm too busy to make your feelings.

00:46.553 --> 00:47.082
Feel good.

00:54.841 --> 00:57.123
It's okay, I'm sure he'll feel bad about it later.

00:57.385 --> 00:59.459
In that case, I will put him on "guilty."

01:02.658 --> 01:06.808
Hey, I'm so sorry about what I said earlier.

01:06.877 --> 01:08.909
That was just... Hey, here.

01:09.026 --> 01:10.279
Please take my credit card.

01:10.695 --> 01:11.889
Buy yourself something nice.

01:12.983 --> 01:14.202
It's the least I can do.

01:20.629 --> 01:21.797
We should move him to "awkward."

01:23.759 --> 01:24.919
That was really weird.

01:25.014 --> 01:25.639
Yeah, it was.

01:26.183 --> 01:27.522
What do you think his credit limit is?
