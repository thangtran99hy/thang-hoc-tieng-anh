00:00.087 --> 00:04.874
ï»¿My favorite President Obama moment was when he was elected President in 2008,...

00:04.963 --> 00:06.860
...because in 2008 was when I was born.

00:07.025 --> 00:09.211
I never cried before from an election result.

00:10.441 --> 00:12.517
I don't know, just the magic of that moment,...

00:12.616 --> 00:15.596
...of that man who we'd all been on this journey with,...

00:15.988 --> 00:17.675
...take that stage with his family.

00:18.132 --> 00:19.538
I was sitting at home in my living room...

00:19.632 --> 00:22.617
...and I felt like I was a part of that crowd in that park.

00:22.799 --> 00:31.727
I didn't think I would live to see an African-American emerge as President, but he did.

00:31.948 --> 00:35.710
Third grade, when we had this project to write a letter to the White House.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.927
It was really strange when he actually replied back because it was like,...

00:39.061 --> 00:42.584
"Whoa, I'm a third grader and I can actually get a response from the President."

00:42.673 --> 00:44.099
"I can actually make a difference."

00:44.413 --> 00:47.737
In the aftermath of the school shootings in Connecticut,...

00:49.292 --> 00:50.351
I don't know how he did it.

00:50.673 --> 00:56.705
At one point, at the lectern, he started to sing "Amazing Grace,"

00:56.823 --> 01:03.212
...and the entire congregation stood up and did the same.

01:03.647 --> 01:07.369
And to me, it was just a powerful moment,...

01:08.140 --> 01:12.455
...and one that the nation needed and one that he was able to provide.

01:13.092 --> 01:18.539
His battle towards the end to pardon a lot of convicted felons...

01:18.619 --> 01:22.129
...who had been given heavy sentences for small, drug-related crimes.

01:22.247 --> 01:27.165
One part I remember most about the visit was how excited everybody in my house was....

01:27.925 --> 01:31.224
...and especially all the young people who were helping us.

01:31.318 --> 01:36.345
And I think the way they got so excited and so happy about it...

01:36.712 --> 01:38.909
...was something that I would always remember.
