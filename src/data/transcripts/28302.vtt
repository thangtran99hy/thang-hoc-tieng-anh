ï»¿Miss Sherman, the thought of leaving my obituary to chance...

00:04.492 --> 00:06.197
...is completely unreasonable to me.

00:06.355 --> 00:08.225
Well, I am the obituary writer...

00:08.381 --> 00:10.932
...so when the time comes, I will be writing your obituary.

00:11.035 --> 00:12.564
I want you to write it now.

00:13.315 --> 00:15.039
Here's the names of a few hundred people.

00:15.695 --> 00:16.749
My name is Anne Sherman.

00:16.849 --> 00:17.783
I'm from the Bristol Gazette.

00:17.887 --> 00:19.832
I'd like to talk to you about Harriet Lauler.

00:19.984 --> 00:22.461
Now, the deceased should be loved by their families.

00:22.587 --> 00:24.702
There's an ex-husband, he's a jackass.

00:24.790 --> 00:26.138
As I live and breathe!

00:26.221 --> 00:28.098
Well, from the looks of it, I'm not sure you do.

00:28.821 --> 00:31.389
The deceased must have touched someone's life.

00:31.489 --> 00:33.697
I hated her so much.

00:33.860 --> 00:35.981
When I was a kid, I loved the radio.

00:36.077 --> 00:37.547
I'd like the job as disc jockey.

00:37.655 --> 00:39.381
And what kind of music would you play?

00:39.504 --> 00:40.526
The right question would be,...

00:40.631 --> 00:43.033
..."What would I play after I play The Kinks."

00:43.358 --> 00:44.371
And who is this?

00:44.577 --> 00:45.340
It's my intern.

00:45.452 --> 00:45.807
Whaddup?

00:45.971 --> 00:48.765
Did I just lose my job to a hundred-year-old woman?

00:52.497 --> 00:55.977
This is Harriet Lauler saying, "Please don't have a nice day."

00:56.153 --> 00:57.922
I don't know if I can write your obituary.

00:58.197 --> 01:00.717
I'm just not ready to close this chapter of my life.

01:00.817 --> 01:02.347
Have a day that matters.

01:02.467 --> 01:03.935
Have a day that's true.

01:04.242 --> 01:04.881
Punch it!

01:07.448 --> 01:09.429
Have a day that means something.

01:09.534 --> 01:11.300
Harriet, you're a piece of work.

01:11.954 --> 01:13.143
I am who I am.
