00:00.051 --> 00:04.521
The idea of making a big deal of revisiting an experience in memory...

00:04.868 --> 00:07.728
...sounds a little strange or simply sad.

00:08.348 --> 00:12.679
We are not assiduous or devoted cultivators of our past experiences.

00:12.963 --> 00:14.977
We shove all the nice things that have happened to us...

00:15.089 --> 00:16.667
...at the back of the cupboard of our minds...

00:16.981 --> 00:19.903
...and don't particularly expect to see them ever again.

00:20.173 --> 00:22.661
They happen, and then we're done with them.

00:23.107 --> 00:25.348
They do sometimes come back to us, unbidden.

00:25.803 --> 00:27.858
We may be on a boring train ride to work...

00:28.025 --> 00:31.165
...and suddenly, an image of a beach at dusk comes to life.

00:31.548 --> 00:33.011
Or, while we're having a bath...

00:33.226 --> 00:37.077
...we remember climbing a flower-covered mountain with a friend a decade before.

00:37.677 --> 00:40.483
But little attention tends to get paid to such moments.

00:40.827 --> 00:43.593
We don't engineer regular encounters with them.

00:44.073 --> 00:48.172
We may feel we have to dismiss them as daydreaming or thinking about nothing.

00:48.813 --> 00:51.982
But what if we were to alter the hierarchy of prestige a little,...

00:52.307 --> 00:55.012
...and argue that regular immersion in our memories...

00:55.287 --> 00:58.365
...is a critical part of what can sustain and console us.

00:58.686 --> 01:03.105
And not least, is perhaps the cheapest and most flexible form of entertainment.

01:03.779 --> 01:06.701
We should learn, regularly, to travel around our minds...

01:06.927 --> 01:10.623
...and think it almost as prestigious to sit at home and reflect on a trip...

01:10.875 --> 01:16.243
...we once took to an island as to trek to this island encased in our cumbersome bodies.
