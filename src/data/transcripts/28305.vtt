ï»¿Canada!

00:02.951 --> 00:06.681
USA, oh, hey there.

00:07.765 --> 00:08.541
It's been a while.

00:08.662 --> 00:09.787
How are your provinces?

00:09.897 --> 00:11.594
Oh, they grew up so fast.

00:13.610 --> 00:15.247
You know, I got my hands full with 10,...

00:15.331 --> 00:17.701
...I don't know how you take care of 50 states.

00:17.881 --> 00:20.203
Yeah, you know, well, it's not easy,...

00:20.287 --> 00:22.530
...the southern ones went through a rebellious phase.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.654
And what about the adopted ones?

00:27.035 --> 00:28.315
Oh, Alaska and Hawaii?

00:28.855 --> 00:30.887
Yeah, I haven't told them yet,...

00:30.971 --> 00:32.398
...but I think they've figured it out by now.

00:34.628 --> 00:36.490
And the really loud one?

00:36.895 --> 00:38.233
Texas is still Texas.

00:40.995 --> 00:42.425
Oh, Canada.

00:45.167 --> 00:48.355
We should, you know, hang out sometime, maybe play some baseball.

00:48.540 --> 00:48.941
What?

00:49.057 --> 00:50.588
What's baseball?

00:52.359 --> 00:53.875
Oh, sorry, I gotta get this.

00:56.055 --> 00:58.649
China, baby, how's it going?

00:59.732 --> 01:02.159
Yes, I know I owe you a lot of money.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.702
Always making it about money.

01:08.397 --> 01:09.715
You know what, listen.

01:09.826 --> 01:12.115
I will get it to you tomorrow.

01:12.249 --> 01:14.003
Do you have like 4 trillion dollars I could borrow?

01:15.534 --> 01:16.622
What am I saying, you're Canada.
