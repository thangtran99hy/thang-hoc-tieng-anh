00:00.523 --> 00:03.120
Wow! Is that a traffic light?

00:03.665 --> 00:05.861
Yes that is, he's our friend.

00:06.176 --> 00:09.569
We all should follow his signal to be safe on the road.

00:09.929 --> 00:12.344
I can tell you all the traffic lights.

00:12.807 --> 00:14.030
Good, go ahead.

00:14.571 --> 00:17.409
Our friend here will give us different signals...

00:17.721 --> 00:20.255
...and you can tell me what each one represents.

00:21.015 --> 00:21.757
Okay.

00:22.087 --> 00:25.135
Now the signal is red it means stop.

00:25.534 --> 00:30.253
You are right when the signal turns red, we all should stop.

00:30.817 --> 00:32.041
Oh now, it's green.

00:32.627 --> 00:34.211
It means we can go.

00:34.847 --> 00:36.950
Yes Jimmy, you are correct.

00:37.653 --> 00:44.797
When the traffic light turns green, we can start walking or we can start driving our cars.

00:45.350 --> 00:47.297
Hey, now it's showing yellow.

00:49.333 --> 00:51.059
I don't know what to do.

00:51.333 --> 00:53.119
Yellow light means wait...

00:53.698 --> 00:58.961
...it tells you that either you will have to wait for the red light or for the green light.
