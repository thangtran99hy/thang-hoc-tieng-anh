00:00.715 --> 00:03.885
ï»¿I am Japanese and I hated myself.

00:05.565 --> 00:08.178
I hated myself for being different from others.

00:08.590 --> 00:11.709
So, now I'm here hoping to change the world to a place...

00:12.141 --> 00:14.418
...where all minorities can feel embraced.

00:16.151 --> 00:19.470
There was a horrific incident last year in Jerusalem...

00:19.688 --> 00:22.659
...when six people were stabbed in a hate crime attack...

00:23.051 --> 00:24.444
...at a gay pride parade.

00:24.990 --> 00:28.561
We hear shocking news of LGBT people being attacked and killed...

00:28.651 --> 00:30.546
...in hate crimes all around the world.

00:31.810 --> 00:34.453
However, for those of us living in Japan,...

00:35.028 --> 00:38.663
...this extreme violence is hard to understand,...

00:39.153 --> 00:41.889
...almost to the point of being unimaginable.

00:42.623 --> 00:46.969
So, does this make Japan a country that truly embraces diversity?

00:48.269 --> 00:51.067
My answer, sadly, is no.

00:52.601 --> 00:56.173
Japan, I feel, is still a closed and intolerant country.

00:56.957 --> 00:58.238
Let me give you an example.

00:58.806 --> 01:01.937
A boy at one of the top universities in Japan committed suicide...

01:02.021 --> 01:04.819
...after experiencing severe bullying for being gay.

01:05.335 --> 01:08.319
Unfortunately, this is not an unusual case.

01:08.608 --> 01:12.700
Seventy percent of the sexual minorities in Japan have experienced bullying in school...

01:13.020 --> 01:17.248
...with 30% of those consider suicide.

01:18.182 --> 01:22.528
What Japan is facing is unconscious discrimination towards minorities.
