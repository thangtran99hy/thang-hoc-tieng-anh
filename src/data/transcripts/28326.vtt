ï»¿I remember one eight-year-old girl who cried and ran away...

00:03.679 --> 00:05.579
...when a black teacher from Haiti showed up.

00:06.638 --> 00:08.889
There can be a similar lack of confidence...

00:09.002 --> 00:11.831
...when they meet people from an LGBT background.

00:12.874 --> 00:16.810
But this little girl, she wasn't trying to discriminate.

00:17.079 --> 00:18.515
She was just scared.

00:19.086 --> 00:22.857
After an hour, she had become good friends with the Haitian teacher,...

00:22.960 --> 00:26.037
...and this is the magic of children.

00:36.244 --> 00:37.434
We all have fears.

00:37.923 --> 00:43.044
Humans are creatures who struggle with the unexpected, unfamiliar and unknown.

00:43.565 --> 00:46.736
Our human nature does not welcome difference.

00:47.025 --> 00:53.137
However, I believe we humans can build a society that truly embraces diversity.

00:53.691 --> 00:56.242
If we can change the unfamiliar to the familiar,...

00:56.561 --> 01:00.907
...if we can change the courage to seeing differences,...

01:01.075 --> 01:03.425
...and if we can explore the beauty of diversity,...

01:03.541 --> 01:08.166
...then I believe we can overcome our weakness of this fear.

01:09.020 --> 01:13.738
With all my love and respect for Japan and to One Young World, thank you.
