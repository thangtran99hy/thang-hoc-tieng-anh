00:00.551 --> 00:04.751
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed.

00:05.715 --> 00:09.980
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head.

00:10.747 --> 00:15.161
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye.

00:15.706 --> 00:19.825
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night.

00:20.818 --> 00:25.624
When you looked over your shoulder, for a minute I forget that I'm older.

00:25.890 --> 00:28.895
I wanna dance with you right now.

00:30.844 --> 00:33.121
And you look as beautiful as ever.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.629
And I swear that every day you'll get better.

00:36.026 --> 00:40.032
You make me feel this way somehow.

00:40.951 --> 00:45.687
I'm so in love with you and I hope you know.

00:46.075 --> 00:50.695
Darling, your love is more worth its weight in gold.

00:51.072 --> 00:55.809
We've come so far my dear, look how we've grown.

00:56.123 --> 01:00.318
And I wanna stay with you until we're gray and old.

01:00.674 --> 01:04.961
Just say you won't let go.
