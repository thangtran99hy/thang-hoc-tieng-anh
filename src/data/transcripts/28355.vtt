ï»¿Hi guys, thanks for coming today.

00:03.122 --> 00:05.046
So, Chevy invited you to this focus group...

00:05.154 --> 00:07.120
...to ask you what kind of person you think would drive...

00:07.216 --> 00:08.850
...their all-new Lego batmobile.

00:10.915 --> 00:12.425
Well, it's all black.

00:12.967 --> 00:14.997
Probably someone with self-esteem issues?

00:15.296 --> 00:15.889
Uh, what?

00:16.085 --> 00:17.705
Yeah, screams "loner" to me.

00:17.814 --> 00:18.123
Does it?

00:18.296 --> 00:19.364
I'd go a different way with it.

00:19.661 --> 00:21.329
I bet he's super outgoing and really popular.

00:21.544 --> 00:24.971
Judging by these rocket launchers, this person's kind of defensive.

00:25.055 --> 00:25.387
Defensive?

00:25.580 --> 00:27.899
I am not defensive, you're defensive, I mean he's...

00:28.354 --> 00:29.431
You're bad at reading people.

00:29.767 --> 00:30.874
And look, there's no backseat.

00:31.279 --> 00:32.225
Probably not many friends.

00:33.071 --> 00:35.327
No, I bet the guy has a lot of friends...

00:35.510 --> 00:37.341
...like, warehouses filled with friends.

00:37.423 --> 00:37.877
Oh, okay.

00:38.177 --> 00:39.375
What makes you say that, Batman?

00:39.487 --> 00:40.080
Look at this.

00:40.237 --> 00:40.970
It's awesome!

00:41.814 --> 00:44.861
You look at the driver and you think, "I totally wanna be that guy."

00:45.783 --> 00:48.849
Well, I think it's perfect for picking up the little ones from soccer practice.

00:49.033 --> 00:50.802
Soccer? Oh, come on!

00:51.813 --> 00:54.818
God, why didn't I create my own focus group, I don't need their opinion.
