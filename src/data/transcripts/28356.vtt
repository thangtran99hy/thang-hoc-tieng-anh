The first step in getting hired is really to get us your application.

00:03.484 --> 00:05.357
Our career site has some great tips...

00:05.417 --> 00:07.830
...on putting together a powerful and compelling resume.

00:08.551 --> 00:10.887
For example, your resume should be concise,...

00:11.121 --> 00:12.631
...generally less than two pages.

00:13.265 --> 00:16.450
Also, you really wanna make sure that it has no errors or mistakes.

00:16.876 --> 00:18.830
Read it top to bottom, bottom to top.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.671
Have a friend take a look at it for you.

00:21.144 --> 00:22.925
Pay extra special attention to it.

00:23.710 --> 00:27.372
Finally, you wanna make sure that your bullet points on your resume convey impact.

00:27.963 --> 00:30.124
Don't just list the things that you did at your current job...

00:30.475 --> 00:32.565
...but really how you impacted that role.
