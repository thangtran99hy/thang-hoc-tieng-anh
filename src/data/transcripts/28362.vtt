00:03.605 --> 00:05.253
It's easy to put people in boxes.

00:07.579 --> 00:08.071
There's us,...

00:09.021 --> 00:09.583
...and there's them.

00:11.286 --> 00:12.025
The high earners,...

00:13.145 --> 00:14.311
...and those just getting by.

00:15.685 --> 00:16.477
Those we trust,...

00:17.727 --> 00:18.919
...and those we try to avoid.

00:20.375 --> 00:21.620
The people from the countryside,...

00:22.764 --> 00:24.040
...and those who've never seen a cow.

00:25.972 --> 00:26.580
The religious,...

00:28.085 --> 00:29.028
...and the self-confident.

00:30.471 --> 00:32.112
There are those we share something with,...

00:33.451 --> 00:34.974
...and those we don't share anything with.

00:36.215 --> 00:38.474
And then suddenly, there's us:...

00:39.499 --> 00:41.264
...we, who believe in life after death;...

00:42.270 --> 00:43.682
...we, who've seen UFOs,...

00:45.228 --> 00:47.424
...and all of us who love to dance.

00:52.053 --> 00:53.183
We, who've been bullied...

00:58.313 --> 00:59.614
...and we, who've bullied others.

01:04.883 --> 01:06.112
We, who are brokenhearted.

01:08.325 --> 01:09.706
We, who are madly in love.

01:13.662 --> 01:14.595
We, who feel lonely.

01:18.259 --> 01:20.476
We, who acknowledge the courage of others.

01:24.104 --> 01:25.883
We, who have found the meaning of life,...

01:27.414 --> 01:28.973
...and we, who have saved lives.

01:30.837 --> 01:34.449
So maybe, there's more that brings us together than we think.
