The Great Depression was a dramatic worldwide economic calamity...

00:05.043 --> 00:08.749
...which started in 1929 and lasted until the late 30s.

00:09.529 --> 00:14.505
Most people believed it begun with the US stock market collapse of October 1929.

00:15.123 --> 00:21.003
By 1932, US stocks were only worth 20% of what they were prior to the crisis.

00:21.222 --> 00:25.391
And one year later, almost half of all United States banks had failed.

00:26.590 --> 00:29.413
Worldwide trade was devastated by the Great Depression,...

00:29.817 --> 00:33.225
...with countries engaging in so-called "trade wars" by limiting imports...

00:33.569 --> 00:38.918
...and by the same year 1932, global trade crashed to half of the precrisis volume.

00:39.782 --> 00:44.429
Unfortunately, trade wars degenerated into an actual armed conflict,...

00:44.751 --> 00:48.415
...which caused over 60 million deaths, World War II.

00:49.253 --> 00:54.410
Make no mistake, most wars have been caused by economic factors to a very large degree.

00:55.153 --> 00:58.343
Let's learn from the past and not let this happen again.
