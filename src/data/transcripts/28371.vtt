Thank you, Amy.

00:05.462 --> 00:06.716
I'm just gonna head on over here.

00:07.097 --> 00:09.853
Yes, I'm angry.

00:11.377 --> 00:14.466
Yes, I am outraged.

00:15.736 --> 00:22.227
Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.

00:25.134 --> 00:29.213
But I know that this won't change anything.

00:31.049 --> 00:33.433
We cannot fall into despair.

00:35.481 --> 00:42.231
As the poet W. H. Auden once wrote on the eve of World War II,...

00:44.085 --> 00:47.603
..."We must love one another or die.

00:49.786 --> 00:50.835
I choose love."
