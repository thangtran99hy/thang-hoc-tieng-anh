00:02.731 --> 00:04.281
First, I was afraid.

00:04.428 --> 00:05.477
I was petrified.

00:05.759 --> 00:08.652
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side.

00:08.983 --> 00:11.183
But then I spent so many nights...

00:11.271 --> 00:12.945
...thinking how you did me wrong.

00:13.083 --> 00:14.136
And I grew strong.

00:14.639 --> 00:16.559
And I learned how to get along.

00:16.615 --> 00:17.692
And so you're back...

00:17.870 --> 00:18.168
You have to march.

00:18.465 --> 00:19.679
...from outer space.

00:19.857 --> 00:24.750
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face.

00:24.865 --> 00:26.667
I should have changed that stupid lock.

00:26.900 --> 00:28.172
I should have made you leave your key.

00:28.276 --> 00:30.144
If I'd known for just one second...

00:30.223 --> 00:32.247
...you'd be back to bother me.

00:32.345 --> 00:33.698
Go on now, go.

00:34.073 --> 00:35.100
Walk out the door.

00:35.402 --> 00:37.197
Just turn around now...

00:37.415 --> 00:38.333
...'cause you're not welcome anymore.

00:38.767 --> 00:40.561
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?

00:40.715 --> 00:42.141
Did you think I'd crumble?

00:42.313 --> 00:43.811
You think I'd lay down and die?

00:43.992 --> 00:45.233
Oh no, not I,...

00:45.515 --> 00:46.830
...I will survive.

00:47.106 --> 00:50.839
Oh, as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive.

00:50.940 --> 00:52.617
I've got all my life to live.

00:52.957 --> 00:54.408
And I've got all my love to give.

00:54.790 --> 00:56.200
And I'll survive.

00:56.439 --> 00:57.764
I will survive.

00:58.043 --> 00:58.833
Hey, hey!

00:59.383 --> 00:59.954
I like that part.

01:00.368 --> 01:03.143
I will survive!
