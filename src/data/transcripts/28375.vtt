You know, when we kinda get caught up in the minutia,...

00:03.231 --> 00:06.974
...the details that make us all different, I think there's two ways of seeing that.

00:08.119 --> 00:10.377
There's an opportunity to see the texture of that person,...

00:11.160 --> 00:13.306
...the characteristics that make them unique.

00:14.036 --> 00:16.634
And then, there's an opportunity to go to war about it,...

00:17.366 --> 00:21.529
...to say that person is different from me and "I don't like you, so let's battle."

00:22.165 --> 00:23.847
My mother is an ordained minister.

00:24.668 --> 00:25.353
I'm a Muslim.

00:25.895 --> 00:29.578
She didn't do backflips when I called her to tell her I converted 17 years ago.

00:30.983 --> 00:33.845
But I tell you now, we put things to the side...

00:34.741 --> 00:38.137
...and I was able to see her, she's able to see me.

00:38.673 --> 00:39.442
We love each other.

00:39.601 --> 00:40.411
The love has grown.

00:40.718 --> 00:41.991
And that stuff is minutia.

00:42.299 --> 00:43.454
It's not that important.
