ï»¿I want you all to know that I am the daughter of an immigrant.

00:06.150 --> 00:12.608
My father fled religious persecution in Nazi-occupied France.

00:14.251 --> 00:19.334
And I'm an American patriot and I love this country.

00:20.308 --> 00:24.469
And because I love this country, I am horrified by its blemishes.

00:25.403 --> 00:28.502
And this immigrant ban is a blemish and it is un-American.

00:29.655 --> 00:31.790
Our guilds are unions of storytellers,...

00:32.145 --> 00:36.294
...who always welcomed those from the nations and of varying beliefs...

00:36.576 --> 00:39.585
...who wish to share their creativity with America.

00:40.402 --> 00:41.928
We are grateful for them.

00:42.545 --> 00:44.428
We stand with them.

00:44.819 --> 00:46.839
And we will fight for them.

00:47.098 --> 00:47.763
Thank you very much.
