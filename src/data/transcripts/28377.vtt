Petra is the holy city of a nomadic Arab tribe called the Nabateans...

00:06.669 --> 00:12.055
...and they built this Petra as their holy city.

00:12.604 --> 00:16.880
They made a fortune by trade and controlling caravan routes,...

00:16.975 --> 00:19.671
...especially with myrrh and frankincense.

00:19.935 --> 00:20.718
They would trade...

00:21.031 --> 00:25.215
...around this entire Arabian Peninsula and the surrounding area...

00:25.287 --> 00:26.541
...and that's how they made their fortune.

00:26.679 --> 00:29.867
We have just arrived to one of the most important...

00:30.133 --> 00:34.618
...and one of the famous landmarks and attractions at Petra and in Jordan.

00:34.851 --> 00:41.288
This is actually the tomb of one the greatest kings of the Nabateans.

00:41.757 --> 00:43.785
It's called "The Treasury" because it was believed...

00:43.922 --> 00:48.312
...that there were some treasures stored in the top, but it's actually a burial tomb.

00:48.561 --> 00:53.504
You can see so many different architectural designs from the Corinthian columns...

00:53.597 --> 01:00.142
...to the Greek influence on the architecture and then all carved into the rock.
