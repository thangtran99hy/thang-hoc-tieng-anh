00:30.347 --> 00:32.417
I'm actually going to show you a waterfall.

00:32.825 --> 00:37.047
After the Hound is dead, Arya rides away on her pony,...

00:37.247 --> 00:40.387
...and is by the Icelandic waterfall, Hjalparfoss.

00:41.059 --> 00:44.410
The Wildlings come attacking from the forest on the other side of the house,...

00:44.549 --> 00:48.187
...and then they take Olly, and they grab Olly by the head and say,...

00:48.295 --> 00:51.294
..."I'm going to eat your dead mama and papa.

00:51.457 --> 00:53.720
Go tell the crows at Castle Black."

00:53.854 --> 00:55.454
Our guide was very enthusiastic,...

00:55.613 --> 00:58.969

00:59.264 --> 01:00.960
...and it was a thoroughly enjoyable day.

01:02.852 --> 01:05.379
Whether you're a huge Game of Thrones fan or not,...

01:05.475 --> 01:07.377
