00:12.181 --> 00:13.865
It's been a total disaster.

00:14.599 --> 00:18.697
And Mark will never ever bet against Trump again.

00:19.274 --> 00:23.063
And I want to just pray for Arnold if we can for those ratings, okay?

00:24.917 --> 00:26.725
Hey Donald, I have a great idea.

00:27.235 --> 00:28.591
Why don't we switch jobs?

00:28.823 --> 00:32.179
You take over TV, because you're such an expert in ratings,...

00:32.401 --> 00:37.200
...and I take over your job and then, people can finally sleep comfortably again.
