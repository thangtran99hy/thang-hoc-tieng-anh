00:00.563 --> 00:03.458
But how do trade barriers play out in the marketplace...

00:03.845 --> 00:06.303
...particularly with respect to the American consumer?

00:06.903 --> 00:09.936
You look at the Camry that we're showing today.

00:10.283 --> 00:11.284
You know that car...

00:11.455 --> 00:16.951
...has the most amount of domestic content of any vehicle made in the US,...

00:17.508 --> 00:20.151
...75 percent, more than any other truck, any other car.

00:20.646 --> 00:23.718
And if based on a back-of-the-napkin calculation,...

00:23.917 --> 00:26.221
That car with a border tax...

00:26.401 --> 00:30.306
...likely gets a thousand-dollar increase in cost.

00:30.833 --> 00:32.107
Who will incur that cost?

00:32.493 --> 00:33.755
The 1000 dollars?

00:34.023 --> 00:38.524
We believe that that's not gonna be able to be absorbed by the manufacturer,...

00:38.811 --> 00:40.965
...has to get passed on to the marketplace.

00:41.316 --> 00:43.495
In other words, the consumer.

00:44.222 --> 00:48.414
And as a result of that, we think it's going to reduce demand for automobiles.

00:48.667 --> 00:50.692
We'll have to adjust our production schedules.

00:50.895 --> 00:53.817
It's gonna have a negative impact on overall employment.
