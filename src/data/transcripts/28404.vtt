San Diego: it's California's second largest city and it's an idyllic place for vacation.

00:09.274 --> 00:13.016
The people are friendly, it's full of history and there's rarely a crowd.

00:13.612 --> 00:14.998
This is the San Diego Zoo...

00:15.078 --> 00:16.936
...just minutes from downtown San Diego.

00:17.055 --> 00:20.721
It's an urban oasis with over 3,000 different animal species.

00:21.461 --> 00:23.623
Definitely get the backstage pass here at the zoo.

00:23.734 --> 00:26.208
It is the most hands-on experience you can have.

00:26.741 --> 00:30.805
Spend an entire week just exploring all there is to do here in Balboa Park.

00:31.279 --> 00:34.021
Art museums, bike trails and that's just the beginning.

00:35.757 --> 00:38.779
Old Town San Diego is considered the birthplace of California.

00:38.901 --> 00:41.359
It's the site of the first Spanish settlement in the state.

00:42.073 --> 00:45.015
Much of the town has been preserved; it's like stepping back in time.

00:45.474 --> 00:47.304
This is the San Diego of the 1800s.
