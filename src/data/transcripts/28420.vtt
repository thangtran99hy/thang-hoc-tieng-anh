ï»¿I'm gonna do something that every kid around the world would love to do.

00:04.043 --> 00:06.883
I'm gonna walk around London and check out all the sites...

00:07.167 --> 00:08.327
...where Harry Potter was filmed.

00:10.275 --> 00:13.062
First stop on the Harry Potter tour is Diagon Alley.

00:13.157 --> 00:15.101
Well actually, it's not really called Diagon Alley.

00:15.169 --> 00:17.221
It's just the inspiration for the film.

00:17.567 --> 00:20.039
It's an alley full of old bookshops...

00:20.113 --> 00:24.090
...and a lot of the bookshops are full of books of magic and potions.

00:24.186 --> 00:28.171
This was the visitors' entrance to the Ministry of Magic in the Order of the Phoenix...

00:28.298 --> 00:30.693
...and that was the entrance to the Leaky Cauldron.

00:32.009 --> 00:35.055
This is Leadenhall Market and it was in the first film...

00:35.248 --> 00:38.439
...and it actually looks like a movie set, but it's a real place.

00:40.002 --> 00:42.743
This is the famous railway station where Harry Potter...

00:42.815 --> 00:45.940
...and all of his buds would get on the train and go to school in Scotland.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.458
This is so cool, I didn't know this existed in real life.

00:48.693 --> 00:50.883
Platform 9 3/4.

00:50.993 --> 00:53.179
This is quite a spot for a photo there, huh?
