ï»¿I still remember that day.

00:03.997 --> 00:05.993
We had won a game of hockey...

00:06.997 --> 00:10.961
...and our coach had invited us home for a celebration dinner.

00:12.659 --> 00:20.125
While everybody's eyes were on the fried fish, I couldn't take mine off Cynthia.

00:21.160 --> 00:26.247
She was the coach's daughter and the most beautiful girl I had ever seen.

00:27.558 --> 00:33.155
That night, I understood the meaning of love at first sight.

00:34.514 --> 00:39.938
Cynthia was just 18, and I didn't know how to tell her that I love her.

00:40.923 --> 00:46.791
So, I somehow gathered the courage and proposed to her with a song.

00:48.911 --> 00:51.512
I turned 100 this year.

00:52.344 --> 00:55.635
I couldn't have gotten this far without my Cynthia.

00:57.476 --> 00:58.528
What can I say?

00:59.058 --> 01:01.202
I was just lucky that I found her.

01:03.790 --> 01:09.063
And so on this day, every year, I sing her that song...

01:10.968 --> 01:15.139
...just to let her know that I still feel the same way I did...

01:16.937 --> 01:19.060
...the first time I saw her.

01:21.327 --> 01:30.468
One day, when we were young, this wonderful morning in May,...

01:30.929 --> 01:41.211
...darling, you told me you loved me, one day when we were young.

01:41.949 --> 01:53.735
Remember, you loved me, one day when we were young.
