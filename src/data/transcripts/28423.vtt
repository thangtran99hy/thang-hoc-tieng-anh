00:00.997 --> 00:02.535
We met in that coffee shop.

00:03.226 --> 00:03.813
You remember?

00:05.249 --> 00:07.629
I looked at you and I liked you from the beginning.

00:09.213 --> 00:13.133
You wanted me to think that you were lost, so you asked me for directions...

00:13.325 --> 00:15.693
...and we ended up talking all night.

00:17.291 --> 00:18.681
I never forgot that summer.

00:20.035 --> 00:21.407
We dated for four years.

00:21.522 --> 00:25.347
We saw each other constantly although we lived in two different countries.

00:27.026 --> 00:29.075
It was hard, but we didn't care.

00:31.203 --> 00:33.106
Finally, we decided to get married,...

00:34.605 --> 00:37.800
...and although it was tough, I moved to your country.

00:40.231 --> 00:42.993
We had two kids, six grandchildren.

00:43.805 --> 00:45.521
Huh! Six!

00:45.909 --> 00:46.827
Can you believe it?

00:50.718 --> 00:52.570
We grew old together.

00:53.516 --> 00:55.466
You gave me a life full of happiness.

01:01.191 --> 01:03.900
That's why it's so hard to let you go...

01:05.113 --> 01:10.269
...because I lost you the moment I decided not to take that trip...

01:10.849 --> 01:13.849
...nor to come to this city, to that coffee shop.

01:15.015 --> 01:18.984
I lost you when I canceled my trip.

01:20.024 --> 01:24.959
I lost you because I never met you.
