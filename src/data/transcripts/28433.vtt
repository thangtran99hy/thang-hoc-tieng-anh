00:01.115 --> 00:03.047
ï»¿Is this the land history promised?

00:04.476 --> 00:06.841
Here, within these lines,...

00:10.687 --> 00:12.591
...on this concrete court,...

00:14.788 --> 00:16.348
...this patch of turf,...

00:17.181 --> 00:19.642
...here, you're defined by your actions,...

00:21.869 --> 00:23.994
...not your looks or beliefs.

00:27.907 --> 00:31.077
Equality should have no boundaries.

00:38.041 --> 00:41.954
The bonds we find here should run past these lines.

00:53.507 --> 00:56.584
Opportunity should not discriminate.

00:57.821 --> 01:00.929
The ball should bounce the same for everyone.

01:08.265 --> 01:10.877
Worth should outshine color.

01:16.981 --> 01:18.237
If we can be equals here,...

01:19.471 --> 01:21.551
...we can be equals everywhere.
