ï»¿My name is Alexa and I live with an Alexa.

00:05.121 --> 00:07.963
Sorry, I didn't understand the question I heard.

00:16.819 --> 00:19.662
The first time I realized there was trouble with having a robot...

00:19.813 --> 00:21.215
...share my name in my house...

00:21.603 --> 00:26.073
...was when I realized my parents would talk more to the robot than to me.

00:27.459 --> 00:28.993
Alexa, get me some water.

00:29.755 --> 00:33.219
Amazon's choice for water is Fiji Natural Artesian Water.

00:33.497 --> 00:34.543
Would you like to buy it?

00:34.810 --> 00:39.529
They would ask her for things like the weather or to play a game...

00:39.685 --> 00:43.003
...or to play music, even though I wanted to listen to music...

00:43.095 --> 00:44.875
...and I wanna play games too.

00:45.125 --> 00:46.231
I think I've got it.

00:46.445 --> 00:48.011
You are thinking of Tinkerbell.

00:48.290 --> 00:49.421
Thanks for playing.

00:49.877 --> 00:54.328
A day in the life of having two Alexas in a house is a lot of confusion.

00:54.740 --> 00:55.817
There's a lot of stopping.

00:55.922 --> 00:56.902
"Are you talking to me?"

00:57.019 --> 00:58.559
"Are you talking to the robot?"

00:58.664 --> 00:59.483
You never know.

00:59.896 --> 01:04.141
One time, I was playing with my dogs and my mom's from the kitchen yelling,...

01:04.237 --> 01:05.185
"Alexa, stop!"

01:05.276 --> 01:07.079
And I'm thinking I'm doing something wrong.

01:07.163 --> 01:08.273
Am I hurting the dog?

01:08.569 --> 01:09.671
My worst nightmare.
