ï»¿Why don't you shop on Amazon?

00:01.959 --> 00:02.669
What's the deal?

00:02.934 --> 00:05.681
Sure, so I just find it a little inconvenient.

00:05.793 --> 00:09.591
I'm someone that likes to see the product I'm gonna get before I go and buy it.

00:09.752 --> 00:14.289
So, I think I like that connection that you still have in-store where you can see it.

00:14.383 --> 00:15.340
You know what it's gonna be.

00:15.443 --> 00:16.503
You know what it's gonna look like.

00:16.785 --> 00:19.285
You try it on and then you purchase it.

00:19.794 --> 00:21.821
I'm also not a fan of the logistics.

00:21.926 --> 00:25.269
So, for me in Brooklyn, I do have some difficulty getting packages...

00:25.726 --> 00:28.961
...so it's actually even more of a hassle to order from Amazon...

00:29.051 --> 00:32.611
...'cause I end up going to UPS or FedEx to go pick it up several days later.

00:32.844 --> 00:37.097
So, it doesn't necessarily get dropped off on your doorstep is what you're saying.

00:37.267 --> 00:38.065
Yeah, exactly.

00:38.745 --> 00:42.039
Do you use Amazon competitors or you just prefer to shop in stores?

00:42.243 --> 00:44.051
I think I just prefer to shop in stores.
