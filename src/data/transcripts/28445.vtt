ï»¿What do I tell my daughter?

00:10.741 --> 00:13.471
Do I tell her that her grandpa's worth is more than her grandma,...

00:17.803 --> 00:19.385
...that her dad is worth more than her mom?

00:23.894 --> 00:29.399
Do I tell her that despite her education, her drive, her skills, her intelligence,...

00:31.077 --> 00:34.621
...she will automatically be valued as less than every man she ever meets?

00:44.473 --> 00:49.115
Or maybe, I'll be able to tell her something different.
