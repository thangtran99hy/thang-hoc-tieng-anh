00:02.535 --> 00:06.603
Borders: has anything good ever come of them?

00:08.227 --> 00:10.777
Separation? Limits?

00:13.727 --> 00:17.640
I've seen as many as mankind has been able to create.

00:17.827 --> 00:19.282
Invisible borders:...

00:19.385 --> 00:23.250
...human, between men and women;...

00:24.523 --> 00:28.003
...between the thin and the fat;...

00:29.561 --> 00:33.535
...between those who make decisions and those who abide by them.

00:33.949 --> 00:36.309
I see borders formed by hate,...

00:36.677 --> 00:41.395
...of speaking a different language or kissing other men...

00:43.615 --> 00:49.571
...or simply because somebody didn't want anything to do with the one next door.

00:50.152 --> 00:54.994
Borders in the name of God, of the law.

00:55.600 --> 01:00.850
Borders: on land they can maintain distances,...

01:02.209 --> 01:05.193
...but in the sky, they don't exist.
