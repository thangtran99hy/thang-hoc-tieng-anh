00:01.485 --> 00:04.053
Do not mistake this for a vacation.

00:05.248 --> 00:07.017
This is a journey,...

00:07.631 --> 00:09.801
...where maps give way to meandering...

00:10.188 --> 00:13.426
...and schedules are left a time zone or two behind.

00:14.679 --> 00:15.524
So, go ahead.

00:17.415 --> 00:18.068
Wander.

00:19.032 --> 00:21.124
Then come home as someone new...

00:21.969 --> 00:23.993
...or at least someone who looks familiar,...

00:24.398 --> 00:27.055
...but tells much more interesting stories.

00:27.811 --> 00:28.566
Travelocity.

00:28.801 --> 00:29.905
Wander wisely.
