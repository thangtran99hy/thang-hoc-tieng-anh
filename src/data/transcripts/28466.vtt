00:01.757 --> 00:03.287
Contrary to ancient wisdom,...

00:03.971 --> 00:05.157
...the sun doesn't rise,...

00:05.839 --> 00:06.289
...we do.

00:07.059 --> 00:10.823
Yet the more we travel, the more the world pushes back,...

00:11.269 --> 00:13.539
...corralling us and controlling us.

00:14.399 --> 00:16.449
So, we seek a place...

00:17.219 --> 00:18.469
...where we're given a choice...

00:20.277 --> 00:21.289
...not just to get up...

00:25.289 --> 00:26.039
...but to rise.
