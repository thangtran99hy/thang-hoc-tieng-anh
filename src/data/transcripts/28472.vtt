I'll have a sausage McMuffin with egg and cheese.

00:03.657 --> 00:06.807
3.17 is a bacon, egg and cheese biscuit.

00:06.950 --> 00:11.941
The market's down this morning, so I can go pass up the 3.17 and go for the 2.95.

00:13.767 --> 00:15.081
So, market's down.

00:15.427 --> 00:17.557
He's worth more than 70 billion dollars...

00:17.950 --> 00:20.785
...but he picks his breakfast based on what the market is doing.

00:20.876 --> 00:22.269
This is why I'm not a billionaire.

00:22.331 --> 00:25.569
I'm not getting that sausage and egg sandwich at McDonald's every morning.

00:25.665 --> 00:27.077
That's gotta be the secret.

00:27.491 --> 00:28.071
I'm not sure.

00:28.184 --> 00:31.005
And I hear his wife puts the change in cups for him...

00:31.075 --> 00:31.701
That might be.

00:31.867 --> 00:33.015
...before he leaves the house.

00:33.119 --> 00:36.015
You know, that really does seem to be, all kidding aside,...

00:36.095 --> 00:39.806
...like a commonality among some of these wildly successful genius people...

00:39.910 --> 00:44.429
...is they take these everyday tasks that some other people spend time thinking about...

00:44.539 --> 00:47.781
...they just, kind of, have 'em taken care of. They don't have to give it any thought.

00:47.847 --> 00:50.531
They do the same thing every day and they move on with what's important.
