00:00.202 --> 00:03.531
But in May of last year, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway...

00:03.837 --> 00:07.581
...disclosed that it made a one-billion-dollar bet on Apple's stock,...

00:08.220 --> 00:11.556
...boosting the company's market value by 18 billion dollars...

00:12.021 --> 00:15.939
...and setting off the iPhone maker's ascent back into record territory.

00:16.555 --> 00:18.645
Buffett's bet was followed by another rally...

00:18.815 --> 00:20.895
...after the presidential election in November,...

00:21.411 --> 00:25.826
...when investors speculated that companies with large overseas cash holdings...

00:26.177 --> 00:28.618
...would benefit from the policies of the Trump administration...

00:28.933 --> 00:30.691
...and a Republican-controlled Congress.

00:31.390 --> 00:35.207
This latest surge to clear the 133-dollar-per-share hurdle...

00:35.615 --> 00:39.406
...puts Apple's market value at about 130 billion dollars,...

00:39.660 --> 00:41.563
...ahead of the number two company Alphabet...

00:42.022 --> 00:46.632
...and beyond the values of Exxon Mobil and JP Morgan Chase combined.
