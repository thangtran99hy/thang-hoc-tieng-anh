I think creativity is a mindset.

00:02.865 --> 00:07.879
It is a way of approaching any problem or any challenge.

00:08.242 --> 00:12.369
It takes me into classrooms to teach girls to express their creativity...

00:12.677 --> 00:13.432
...through writing code.

00:14.882 --> 00:18.893
I had to develop that confidence in my own skills,...

00:19.015 --> 00:21.181
...to be creative in my own true way.

00:22.243 --> 00:25.988
I'm Karlie Kloss and creativity helps me make a difference in the world.
