00:01.660 --> 00:02.960
We've been fed a lie,...

00:04.614 --> 00:06.197
...that hard work is enough.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.948
We use something more powerful:....

00:10.441 --> 00:11.401
...creativity.

00:11.913 --> 00:13.629
It starts new religions,...

00:14.067 --> 00:15.761
...defies the status quo,...

00:16.813 --> 00:18.345
...reinvents routine.

00:22.763 --> 00:27.239
When we unleash our creativity, that makes all the difference.
