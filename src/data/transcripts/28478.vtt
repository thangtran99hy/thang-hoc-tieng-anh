00:00.452 --> 00:03.455
ï»¿And thank you very much for inviting me over to the White House.

00:03.836 --> 00:09.541
My name is Abe but in the United States, some people mistakenly pronounce my name as "Abe".

00:09.738 --> 00:10.740
But that is not bad...

00:11.181 --> 00:17.529
...because even in Japan, everybody knows the name of that great president,...

00:18.006 --> 00:20.941
...that a farmer carpenter's son can become a President.

00:21.046 --> 00:31.057
And that fact, 150 years ago, surprised the Japanese who were still under the Shogunate rule...

00:31.830 --> 00:34.791
The Japanese opened their eyes to democracy.

00:35.284 --> 00:38.699
United States is the champion of democracy.

00:39.589 --> 00:43.847
Donald, President, you are an excellent businessman...

00:44.446 --> 00:48.609
...but you have never been in the congress or been the governor.

00:48.885 --> 00:51.668
You have not experienced being in the public office...

00:51.824 --> 00:58.512
...but you have fought the uphill struggle and fight for more than a year...

00:59.238 --> 01:02.573
...in the election campaign to become a new president...

01:02.653 --> 01:05.861
...and this is the dynamism of democracy.

01:06.686 --> 01:12.718
I would like to celebrate and congratulate Donald being sworn in as the President.
