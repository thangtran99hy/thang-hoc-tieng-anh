Nearly 7.4 billion people share the Earth.

00:05.303 --> 00:07.157
One in ten live on less than $2 a day.

00:09.391 --> 00:10.771
One in nine don't have enough food.

00:12.644 --> 00:15.647
In developing countries, infectious diseases are the biggest killers:...

00:15.995 --> 00:20.991
...respiratory infections, malaria, AIDS but there are solutions.

00:21.777 --> 00:25.054
Deaths caused by malaria have decreased by 60% since 2000.

00:25.678 --> 00:28.596
And today, researchers in Tanzania hope to eliminate it completely...

00:28.665 --> 00:29.875
...with a range of new inventions,...

00:30.216 --> 00:31.673
...including a mosquito-repellent chair.

00:32.887 --> 00:36.720
In the past decade, the number of undernourished people has dropped by 100 million.

00:37.830 --> 00:40.733
And cellphone networks being used in Kenya, Uganda and Peru...

00:40.873 --> 00:42.290
...could help further eliminate hunger.

00:42.937 --> 00:46.241
Global problems are improving but there's still much work to be done.

00:47.121 --> 00:48.747
So, what happens next?

00:49.191 --> 00:49.747
Are you ready, sir?

00:50.168 --> 00:50.485
Okay.
