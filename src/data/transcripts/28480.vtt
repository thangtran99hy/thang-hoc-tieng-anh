00:02.417 --> 00:04.031
This is my whole world:...

00:04.279 --> 00:06.606
...my nurse, my mom, my sickness.

00:06.775 --> 00:08.666
I'm 18 and I've never been outside.

00:09.091 --> 00:10.897
If I did, I would probably die.

00:15.657 --> 00:16.145
He's here.

00:16.748 --> 00:17.139
Who's here?

00:21.528 --> 00:23.138
You're really different than I thought you were gonna be.

00:23.323 --> 00:23.943
Sexier, right?

00:24.955 --> 00:26.429
What would happen if you went outside?

00:26.750 --> 00:28.305
Probably spontaneous combustion.

00:28.559 --> 00:32.320
Here I have HEPA filters, outside it's viruses and bacteria.

00:32.948 --> 00:34.334
Where would you go if you could?

00:34.639 --> 00:35.203
The ocean.

00:35.502 --> 00:36.581
I've never seen it.

00:45.584 --> 00:46.165
Dear mom,...

00:46.475 --> 00:50.216
I know staying in this house keeps me alive, but this isn't living.

00:51.913 --> 00:53.516
I want to experience everything.

00:54.018 --> 00:54.575
Everything.

00:55.376 --> 00:56.174
Maddy, what are you doing?

00:56.276 --> 00:57.050
Go back inside.

00:57.111 --> 00:58.765
No! Olly, I have to know if I'm really sick...

00:58.933 --> 01:00.730
...and the only way that I'll know is if I'm outside.

01:07.431 --> 01:11.081
I'm willing to sacrifice everything just to live one perfect day.
