Hi, I'm Jimmy Kimmel and I'm the host of the Oscars this year.

00:03.391 --> 00:05.271
You know, I get so many letters from people asking me,...

00:05.716 --> 00:06.653
..."How do I win one of these?"

00:06.833 --> 00:09.609
And well, first thing you have to do is get a job as a waiter.

00:10.240 --> 00:12.365
Mozzarella sticks and your side of donut holes.

00:12.530 --> 00:13.792
Don't mind if I dip.

00:14.267 --> 00:14.713
Thank you.

00:15.149 --> 00:17.722
Next, you have to go to a lot of auditions.

00:18.575 --> 00:20.349
I don't care how allergic you are, Senator.

00:20.425 --> 00:22.699
There's no law that says that a dog can't be president!

00:23.500 --> 00:24.577
That's actually true.

00:25.162 --> 00:28.957
And finally, when you do get the role, you have to act your little heart out.

00:29.559 --> 00:31.033
Don't you die on me, soldier!

00:31.481 --> 00:32.325
That's an order!

00:33.616 --> 00:36.734
And if all goes well, the Oscar goes to you.

00:39.781 --> 00:42.027
I would like to thank my shaman, Maurita.

00:42.114 --> 00:43.035
Don't forget to thank your mother.

00:43.421 --> 00:43.589
Oh yeah.

00:43.709 --> 00:44.941
Thanks mom and...

00:45.227 --> 00:46.895
Also, keep it short, I have things to do.

00:47.735 --> 00:48.841
And thank you to the Academy.

00:49.435 --> 00:51.663
Wow, it's just that simple.

00:52.178 --> 00:52.879
The Oscars.

00:53.388 --> 00:53.848
Where are you going?

00:54.054 --> 00:54.732
The Oscars.

00:54.837 --> 00:55.451
That's not yours.

00:55.668 --> 00:58.310
Live February 26th on ABC
