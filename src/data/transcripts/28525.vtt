ï»¿Today, we're learning about New Year's dishes.

00:03.575 --> 00:07.428
Japan's most important holiday is the family celebration of the New Year...

00:07.693 --> 00:10.074
...with Osechi or New Year's Dishes.

00:10.645 --> 00:14.929
This time we're making ozoni, one of the most essential dishes for this celebration.

00:15.331 --> 00:19.275
Osechi were originally formal dishes that were offered to the gods...

00:19.835 --> 00:21.657
...for happiness in the New Year.

00:22.411 --> 00:24.105
After these offerings were made,...

00:24.412 --> 00:27.953
...Japanese people enjoyed Osechi dishes with their families.

00:32.252 --> 00:36.193
Ozoni, made with mochi or rice cakes, plays the main role.

00:36.881 --> 00:41.351
Mochi is often toasted and eaten with bonito kombu dashi broth.

00:45.503 --> 00:50.499
Each ingredient in ozoni has a particular meaning for bringing peace in the New Year.
