ï»¿The wait is finally over.

00:03.313 --> 00:05.277
My bowl of ramen has arrived...

00:05.443 --> 00:08.343
...and I think this might be the most beautiful bowl of ramen...

00:08.425 --> 00:10.895
...that has ever been on the table before me.

00:11.121 --> 00:14.064
But what's really impressing me as I just sat here waiting for my bowl...

00:14.166 --> 00:17.340
...is just the care that they put into making the ramen here.

00:17.439 --> 00:20.696
There are only three people running this entire restaurant...

00:20.987 --> 00:24.019
...and they just do everything with expertise...

00:24.095 --> 00:27.864
...like, artisan; yeah, they're really artisan ramen makers.

00:27.949 --> 00:29.597
The noodles look perfect.

00:29.775 --> 00:31.374
The decoration, just look how beautiful this is.

00:31.448 --> 00:34.157
And this is just a really normal restaurant, but just look at that care.

00:34.523 --> 00:36.044
Everything is arranged beautifully.

00:36.353 --> 00:42.787
These are pieces of chashu, really just unbelievable tender-looking.

00:43.035 --> 00:44.735
And then over here, it almost looks like,...

00:45.055 --> 00:49.095
...I'm not sure if that's chicken or that's pork, but that came out of the wok.

00:49.197 --> 00:50.530
He fried this up in a wok.

00:50.797 --> 00:52.295
There's half of an egg here.

00:52.497 --> 00:57.954
There are onions, these are shreds of, I'm not sure what that is.

00:58.395 --> 00:59.500
There are green onions on this side...

00:59.578 --> 01:06.215
...and just marvel at the thickness and the richness of that broth.

01:06.895 --> 01:08.687
I gotta taste that broth first before I do anything.

01:17.251 --> 01:19.273
Oh, that is absurd!
