To this day, this shake remains one of the most well-known desserts at Mickey D's.

00:04.603 --> 00:10.187
We're gonna start by putting two heaping scoops of vanilla bean ice cream into your blender.

00:10.593 --> 00:13.257
Then we're gonna pour about a quarter cup of half-and-half.

00:13.690 --> 00:15.741
Now, you could use milk but the half-and-half,...

00:16.059 --> 00:17.860
...that's what makes it nice and creamy.

00:18.903 --> 00:20.807
Then you're gonna add your peppermint extract.

00:20.969 --> 00:24.784
Now, this is where it takes it from a vanilla shake to a shamrock shake.

00:25.502 --> 00:28.285
Then put five to six drops of green food coloring.

00:31.295 --> 00:35.841
Put the lid on and blend it for about 30 seconds until it's nice and smooth.

00:38.282 --> 00:39.436
Pour it into a glass.

00:40.897 --> 00:44.385
Put a dollop of whipped cream on top and don't forget the cherry.
