ï»¿When I became a dad, I made a choice to support my daughter's dreams.

00:05.909 --> 00:06.963
You don't have enough money.

00:07.234 --> 00:09.699
It says right here we got 401,000 dollars.

00:10.058 --> 00:10.544
Jackpot!

00:11.277 --> 00:11.769
You missed it.

00:11.869 --> 00:14.248
Uh, that says you have a 401k account.

00:15.082 --> 00:17.219
Alex thinks we can afford tuition and we can't.

00:17.351 --> 00:17.953
We gotta lie.

00:18.104 --> 00:20.211
That's what parents do because otherwise our kid's gonna realize that...

00:20.715 --> 00:21.879
...we don't know what we're doing.

00:22.469 --> 00:23.057
Welcome.

00:23.189 --> 00:27.786
I have a way for you guys to make four years tuition in one month:...

00:28.319 --> 00:29.409
...underground casino!

00:29.679 --> 00:30.411
Do the math.

00:31.008 --> 00:31.795
It seems to check out.

00:31.890 --> 00:32.452
Do this math.

00:32.991 --> 00:35.064
You're 40 years old and you go to jail for 20 years.

00:35.141 --> 00:36.079
How old are you when you get out?

00:36.453 --> 00:36.763
90

00:36.941 --> 00:37.206
No.

00:37.339 --> 00:37.659
Hundred.

00:37.797 --> 00:38.027
Honey!

00:38.097 --> 00:39.817
If I have some scratch paper, I can figure it out.

00:41.052 --> 00:44.458
You wanna make money like Vegas, you gotta look like Vegas.

00:44.539 --> 00:46.295
I am not gonna tell my daughter she can't go to college...

00:46.373 --> 00:47.588
...so we resorted to a life of crime.

00:49.645 --> 00:50.511
Guys, we got a problem.

00:50.655 --> 00:51.295
He's cheating!

00:51.454 --> 00:53.567
We gotta send a message, like De Niro in "Casino."

00:53.773 --> 00:54.994
You think you can cheat us?

00:55.079 --> 00:56.603
What are you guys gonna do about it anyway?

00:57.286 --> 00:58.533
Oh, I'm so scared.

00:59.455 --> 01:00.129
I'm gonna do this.

01:00.207 --> 01:00.923
No, I'm gonna do this!

01:00.990 --> 01:01.469
Hey, hey, hey!

01:01.533 --> 01:03.183
Don't play around with the ax, come on!

01:07.749 --> 01:11.208
Tell your friends if they mess with us, this is what you're gonna get.
