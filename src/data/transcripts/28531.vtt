00:05.424 --> 00:07.382
Allow me to introduce the rest of us.

00:10.926 --> 00:16.511
We're the makers, the directors and the creators of this generation.

00:17.865 --> 00:22.150
We don't have big award shows or huge budgets or fancy cameras,...

00:22.461 --> 00:28.106
...but what we do have are our phones and duct tape and parking lots and guts...

00:28.454 --> 00:30.385
...and we have ideas we need to share.

00:31.045 --> 00:34.547
We know it's not the size of the production that matters; it's what you make.

00:36.356 --> 00:37.971
We don't create because we have to,...

00:38.128 --> 00:39.989
...we create because we love to,...

00:40.136 --> 00:43.983
...and we've captured billions of moments from different angles...

00:44.081 --> 00:46.503
...for different reasons, for millions of viewers,...

00:46.896 --> 00:48.536
...but with one thing in common.

00:48.820 --> 00:52.323
When we're told that we can't, we all have the same answer.

00:55.374 --> 00:56.109
Watch me.

00:58.455 --> 00:59.094
Thank you.
