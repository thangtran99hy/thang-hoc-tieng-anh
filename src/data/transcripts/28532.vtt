ï»¿Apple unveils its first original series to premiere on Apple Music.

00:07.671 --> 00:11.499
The trailer for the show was released February 13th at the Code Media conference.

00:11.859 --> 00:14.072
It's called "Planet of the Apps",...

00:14.517 --> 00:18.491
...a reality show that's been described as a cross between "Shark Tank" and "The Voice."

00:18.792 --> 00:21.698

00:21.955 --> 00:24.611
...to pitch their idea to a panel of four celebrity judges...

00:25.021 --> 00:26.809
...while standing on a descending escalator.

00:27.083 --> 00:31.250
The four judges include actresses Jessica Alba and Gwyneth Paltrow,...

00:31.403 --> 00:34.941
...musician Will.I.Am and entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk.

00:35.382 --> 00:39.277
If one of them likes the idea enough, the contestant can partner with the judge,...

00:39.384 --> 00:40.785
...who will act as an adviser.

00:41.293 --> 00:43.837
The show culminates in contestants getting to make their pitch...

00:43.912 --> 00:46.051
...to a venture capitalist group for funding.

00:46.534 --> 00:48.485
The trailer's elicited mixed reactions,...

00:48.806 --> 00:52.229
...with much negative feedback coming from the world of developers...

00:52.348 --> 00:54.382
...and some of Apple's own employees.
