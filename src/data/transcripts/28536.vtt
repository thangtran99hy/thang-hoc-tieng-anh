ï»¿I love to swim but I really love to dive.

00:04.843 --> 00:06.634
Dive ends with - ive.

00:07.707 --> 00:10.742
After swimming, we ordered pizza.

00:13.137 --> 00:16.827
How soon until it will arrive?

00:18.179 --> 00:19.389
Not too long.

00:19.477 --> 00:22.311
It's not a far drive.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.333
I hope you're hungry.

00:24.527 --> 00:27.202
We ordered a lot of pizzas.

00:27.530 --> 00:29.291
How many did we order?

00:29.617 --> 00:31.148
Twenty-five!

00:34.333 --> 00:35.939
I love pizza.

00:36.222 --> 00:39.873
I'm so happy, I could dance the jive.

00:45.998 --> 00:48.015
Uh-oh, is that a bee?

00:48.447 --> 00:52.071
We must be sitting near a hive.

00:55.019 --> 00:57.378
Oh no, don't squish them.

00:57.685 --> 01:00.608
We want to keep the bees alive.

01:05.477 --> 01:10.071
If we want to eat honey, the bees have to survive.
