ï»¿His name is Jake and he loves to bake.

00:05.387 --> 00:07.010
What does he bake?

00:07.430 --> 00:10.662
That's easy: cake!

00:11.048 --> 00:12.732
It's time to frost it!

00:13.502 --> 00:16.703
But be careful he doesn't drop the icing...

00:17.032 --> 00:20.976
...because sometimes his tail likes to shake!

00:21.897 --> 00:23.921
That was delicious!

00:24.107 --> 00:31.548
Sometimes he likes to take his cake and eat it by the lake.

00:35.591 --> 00:41.207
And when he's done, he works in the garden with his rake.

00:41.877 --> 00:43.777
It's a sudden snow storm.

00:43.988 --> 00:46.725
Look, there's a snowflake.

00:47.713 --> 00:52.027
Don't worry Jake, it's not really snow.

00:52.314 --> 00:54.369
It's all just fake.

00:55.165 --> 00:59.326
All that hard work makes him sleepy.

00:59.687 --> 01:02.361
So it's hard to stay awake.

01:05.146 --> 01:06.675
Good night, Jake.
