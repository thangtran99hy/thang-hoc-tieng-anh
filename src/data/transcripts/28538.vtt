Wow Dee, your bike sure is cool!

00:17.921 --> 00:18.878
Thanks, Chris.

00:19.016 --> 00:21.319
I'm really excited to learn how to ride it.

00:21.599 --> 00:22.903
Have you tried it yet?

00:23.190 --> 00:24.085
Of course.

00:24.345 --> 00:26.003
But not without my helmet.

00:26.768 --> 00:28.859
Why do you have to wear a helmet?

00:29.190 --> 00:31.765
You should always wear a helmet when you ride your bike.

00:31.993 --> 00:33.894
It keeps your noggin safe.

00:34.307 --> 00:35.325
Your noggin?

00:36.127 --> 00:37.286
That's a funny word.

00:37.506 --> 00:38.221
What's that?

00:38.884 --> 00:40.575
Your noggin is your head.

00:40.882 --> 00:42.974
At least that's what my grandma calls it.

00:43.404 --> 00:45.652
"Got to keep the old noggin safe."

00:46.895 --> 00:49.043
I like that, noggin!
