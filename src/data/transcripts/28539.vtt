ï»¿Peter, you brought your own soccer ball with you to school today?

00:04.590 --> 00:05.781
I sure did!

00:06.231 --> 00:09.556
Good Old Spots here is my lucky soccer ball.

00:09.805 --> 00:12.851
He never misses the goal when I kick him.

00:13.053 --> 00:16.335
Awesome, let's play soccer during recess.

00:16.542 --> 00:20.595
Ok, I love playing soccer anytime.

00:20.822 --> 00:22.708
It's my favorite sport.

00:22.992 --> 00:25.128
My favorite sport is baseball.

00:25.491 --> 00:28.351
I like hitting a home run and winning the game.

00:29.092 --> 00:34.367
Winning is fun, but it's okay to lose too as long as you try your best.

00:34.899 --> 00:36.386
I guess so.

00:36.734 --> 00:42.597
Win or lose, you should be a good sport by always being nice to the other team.

00:42.921 --> 00:45.253
No one likes a sore winner.

00:45.555 --> 00:46.357
You're right.

00:46.802 --> 00:50.777
I guess it doesn't matter who wins or loses as long as we have fun.

00:51.417 --> 00:55.299
Hopefully, today at recess everyone will be a good sport.

00:55.693 --> 00:58.213
No sore losers or winners.

00:58.633 --> 01:01.493
Well, there are definitely going to be winners.

01:01.680 --> 01:06.925
Because I'm feeling super quick today so you and Old Spots better watch out.

01:08.621 --> 01:10.335
You hear that Old Spots?

01:10.672 --> 01:15.299
Let's teach Chris how much fun it is to lose sometimes.
