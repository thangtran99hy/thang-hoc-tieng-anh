00:00.937 --> 00:03.031
First, I pick out what to wear on top.

00:03.465 --> 00:04.757
That means my shirt.

00:05.906 --> 00:10.953
This part is easy because my giraffe shirt is my favorite.

00:11.766 --> 00:14.823
Then, I have to pick out what to wear in the bottom.

00:15.359 --> 00:19.343
I couldn't decide on pants or skirt for today.

00:20.327 --> 00:22.111
So, I chose both.

00:23.185 --> 00:26.311
I also think about what the weather is going to be like.

00:26.551 --> 00:29.342
And I make sure I choose the right clothes for it.

00:30.769 --> 00:33.241
If it's cold outside,...

00:33.508 --> 00:38.071
...I'll bundle up and wear clothes that keep me warm.

00:38.657 --> 00:44.354
And if it's warm outside, I can wear clothes that can be cool.
