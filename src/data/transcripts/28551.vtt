ï»¿Our life is full of ups and downs.

00:04.557 --> 00:07.556
It doesn't matter who you are or where you live.

00:08.211 --> 00:13.150
There are always moments when your heart is broken, burnt or hurt...

00:16.764 --> 00:20.692
...when you have to face failure, rejection or loss.

00:25.603 --> 00:28.005
So how do you pick yourself up when you are down?

00:29.771 --> 00:32.490
How do you start your healing when you are hurt?

00:33.232 --> 00:40.747
Being connected with nature results in some amazing changes inside your head,...

00:41.519 --> 00:44.757
...which begin to calm you and soothe your nerves.

00:46.935 --> 00:50.679
If you rest your mind and reflect, you'll know.

00:53.204 --> 00:53.961
It's nature.

00:56.003 --> 00:58.756
One cannot escape the ups and downs of life,...

01:00.335 --> 01:03.575
...but one can always find calm in nature.

01:06.547 --> 01:11.353
One can always find comfort and clarity in the company of woods.
