ï»¿How much do you feel you know about my work?

00:02.473 --> 00:03.062
Nothing.

00:07.985 --> 00:09.569
What is my job title?

00:10.387 --> 00:11.250
Baker boy?

00:11.362 --> 00:11.842
I'm done.

You're the...

00:15.077 --> 00:15.953
Where do I work?

00:16.252 --> 00:18.037
You work at places with six names.

00:18.127 --> 00:18.963
What the hell is that?

00:19.509 --> 00:20.601
That's not the name of our company.

00:20.685 --> 00:21.778
That's the name of our website.

00:22.302 --> 00:23.272
What's the name of the company?

00:26.400 --> 00:29.522
Well, I think you do all the work, I can't see the partners doing any work.

00:29.943 --> 00:32.779
Basically, you cook stuff.

00:33.238 --> 00:34.985
Frankly, I think in a few more years,..

00:35.059 --> 00:37.021
...if you don't do well, you might as well pack it up.

00:39.077 --> 00:41.365
What would your number one piece of career advice be?

00:41.747 --> 00:42.808
Forget plan b.

00:42.959 --> 00:43.497
Get a job.

00:43.633 --> 00:44.720
Become a millionaire.

00:45.117 --> 00:47.837
Am I doing the job you hoped I'd be doing?

00:48.519 --> 00:49.815
I'm not disappointed.

00:50.539 --> 00:51.240
Okay.

00:51.369 --> 00:52.887
I'm just proud of you.

00:53.067 --> 00:55.395
I know that you got quite a big job.

00:55.873 --> 00:57.981
What do you think you would be like in my job?

00:58.404 --> 00:59.453
I might do a bad job.

01:01.403 --> 01:03.168
Would you like to see my workplace?

01:03.283 --> 01:04.837
Yeah, I can do the catering!

01:05.083 --> 01:06.091
Do we get lunch?

01:06.655 --> 01:07.529
Yeah.

01:07.633 --> 01:08.665
Yeah, then I want to.
