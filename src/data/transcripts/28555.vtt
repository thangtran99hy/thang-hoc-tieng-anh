A Turkish chef has the world salivating.

00:07.130 --> 00:09.471
Nusret Gokce was little known outside of Turkey,..

00:09.623 --> 00:12.342
...until Instagram videos of him slicing and salting steak...

00:12.421 --> 00:14.349
...in his own unique way went viral.

00:14.683 --> 00:18.691
The video shows Gokce coiling his arm and drizzling salt off his elbow unto meat...

00:18.817 --> 00:20.643
...in a way that some say is sensual.

00:20.891 --> 00:22.563
It's earned him the nickname "Salt Bae",...

00:22.651 --> 00:25.325
...based on an acronym that means "Before Anyone Else."

00:25.776 --> 00:27.449
Gokce caught fire in January...

00:27.598 --> 00:30.923
...when musician Bruno Mars tweeted an image of the butcher in mid salt.

00:31.406 --> 00:34.205
Since then, the butcher has taken advantage of the spotlight,...

00:34.344 --> 00:38.474
...posting videos of himself slapping, stroking and dancing with meat.

00:38.870 --> 00:42.133
He says he poses for a thousand photos with fans each day.

00:42.555 --> 00:46.035
The viral video has also inspired some copycats like "Cat Bae",...

00:46.183 --> 00:48.826
...a man who prepares food for his cat in similar fashion.

00:49.059 --> 00:50.869
Even athletes are getting in on the move.

00:50.993 --> 00:53.688
Kansas City Chief's tight end Travis Kelce air-sliced...

00:53.821 --> 00:58.105
...and salted imaginary meat during a touchdown celebration at this year's NFL Pro Bowl.
