The key to long-term travel is finding jobs that will take you to new places,...

00:03.718 --> 00:06.400
...help you save cash and let you travel in your free time.

00:06.599 --> 00:09.675
Teaching English is a great way to immerse yourself in foreign culture,...

00:09.995 --> 00:12.255
...learn a new language and travel on the weekends.

00:12.419 --> 00:15.467
In countries like the UAE or Korea, the pay is high...

00:15.542 --> 00:18.242
...and they'll oftentimes cover accommodation and flights,...

00:18.411 --> 00:20.664
...which is a great option if you have student loans.

00:20.759 --> 00:23.353
These days, certain jobs can be done from anywhere,...

00:23.579 --> 00:27.581
...whether it's programming to graphic design or freelance writing and photography.

00:27.837 --> 00:32.064
The key is "geoarbitrage," earning money in a strong currency and spending it...

00:32.254 --> 00:33.443
...where life's a little bit cheaper.

00:33.579 --> 00:35.877
School is free in many European countries.

00:35.991 --> 00:38.303
In Scandinavia, they even pay you to go to school.

00:38.573 --> 00:41.829
There are also scholarships that will fund you to do research abroad.

00:42.149 --> 00:44.965
Most major corporations have offices overseas,...

00:45.115 --> 00:48.268
...oftentimes in really cool countries with a lower cost of living.

00:48.528 --> 00:51.364
So, instead of quitting your job, you could just outsource yourself.

00:51.690 --> 00:54.207
Apply for a transfer for six months to a year...

00:54.498 --> 00:56.977
...and that can be even better than getting a raise or the corner office.
