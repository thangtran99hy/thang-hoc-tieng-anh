00:01.147 --> 00:04.736
Chris and I were looking at Chris's book about tigers.

00:05.413 --> 00:07.054
It was so cool.

00:07.391 --> 00:12.767
It had pictures of orange tigers and white tigers.

00:13.397 --> 00:17.032
Then out of nowhere, we went over a bump.

00:21.083 --> 00:23.938
We dropped the book and it landed far away.

00:24.641 --> 00:26.780
"Don't worry, I'll get it," I said.

00:27.420 --> 00:28.655
"Wait!" Chris said.

00:29.269 --> 00:34.067
"You should stay seated until the bus driver says that it is okay to stand,"...

00:34.603 --> 00:35.283
...he told me.

00:35.831 --> 00:38.802
"But I'm going to get your book," I said.

00:39.543 --> 00:41.777
Then, we went over another bump.

00:43.619 --> 00:45.851
And I fell back into my seat.

00:46.659 --> 00:48.900
"Are you okay?" Chris asked.

00:49.715 --> 00:51.331
"Yes," I said.

00:51.727 --> 00:52.901
But you're right.

00:53.519 --> 00:56.530
It's safer to stay seated when I'm on the bus.

00:56.881 --> 00:58.799
We can get the book when we get there.

00:59.045 --> 01:01.789
And when the bus driver says it's okay to stand.
