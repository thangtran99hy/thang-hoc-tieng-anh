ï»¿Thank you to the Academy.

00:03.453 --> 00:04.693
You know, there's one place...

00:05.919 --> 00:09.703
...that all the people with the greatest potential are gathered.

00:10.606 --> 00:11.352
One place.

00:12.993 --> 00:14.104
And that's the graveyard.

00:17.087 --> 00:24.073
People ask me all the time, "What kind of stories do you want to tell, Viola?"

00:25.459 --> 00:27.736
And I say, "Exhume those bodies."

00:28.849 --> 00:30.226
Exhume those stories:...

00:31.297 --> 00:34.489
...the stories of the people who dreamed big...

00:35.568 --> 00:37.544
...and never saw those dreams to fruition,...

00:39.211 --> 00:41.349
...people who fell in love and lost.

00:43.205 --> 00:46.302
I became an artist and thank God I did....

00:46.825 --> 00:51.983
...because we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life.

01:01.371 --> 01:07.902
So, here's to August Wilson, who exhumed and exalted the ordinary people.
