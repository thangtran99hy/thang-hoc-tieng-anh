ï»¿McDonald's has elevated shamrock season to new heights...

00:05.976 --> 00:11.410
...with the transcendent line of McCafe beverages combining mint and chocolate flavors.

00:12.287 --> 00:17.019
And every once in a while, along comes something so revolutionary,...

00:17.942 --> 00:19.157
...it changes everything.

00:20.841 --> 00:24.187
This is not that but it's close.

00:24.471 --> 00:26.239
The Chocolate Shamrock Shake:...

00:27.377 --> 00:31.267
...expertly crafted using a dual layer design that combines both a chocolate shake...

00:31.588 --> 00:35.265
...and a mint flavored shake into a single, portable drinking vessel.

00:36.366 --> 00:40.437
But we soon realized a conventional, mono-cylindrical straw...

00:40.496 --> 00:42.467
...simply would not provide the ideal flavor ratio.

00:43.886 --> 00:49.689
Thus, a spectacularly unnecessary product was born.

00:50.796 --> 00:54.573
The suction tube for reverse axial withdrawal,...

00:55.431 --> 00:56.220
...the "Straw".

00:58.401 --> 01:05.314
Conceived, designed and executed by a real team of actual super-duper smart aerospace engineers...

01:05.385 --> 01:08.893
...that McDonald's collaborated with, the straw delivers.

01:11.453 --> 01:14.062
Two shake flavors to your mouth.

01:15.130 --> 01:15.521
Magic.
