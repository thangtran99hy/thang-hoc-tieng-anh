Once long ago, in the deep blue below...

00:07.321 --> 00:08.695
There's no such thing as mermaids.

00:08.944 --> 00:10.427
You wouldn't say that if you had met one.

00:13.320 --> 00:17.904
There is some magic that is real and some that is illusion.

00:18.076 --> 00:18.379
Wow!

00:18.646 --> 00:20.852
Let me introduce you to your dreams:...

00:20.951 --> 00:23.129
...the little mermaid of the Mississippi!

00:27.691 --> 00:29.161
You're the mermaid.

00:29.609 --> 00:29.993
I am.

00:30.378 --> 00:31.716
How do you have legs?

00:31.929 --> 00:32.688
It's a secret.

00:34.818 --> 00:36.658
Where I come from, we have a fairy tale...
