00:01.504 --> 00:06.355
ï»¿I am a world record holder for being the oldest woman skydiver in the world.

00:06.998 --> 00:11.763
I don't worry that my carpet is rather threadbare and old as long as I'm skydiving.

00:13.474 --> 00:14.597
But I do get scared,...

00:14.696 --> 00:19.357
...and I used to be so scared that I would drive the car up to the drop zone...

00:19.953 --> 00:21.299
...and think, "I could go back,"...

00:21.514 --> 00:25.299
..."I don't have to stay here," but I knew if I went away, I'd never come back again.

00:25.551 --> 00:28.319
So, the ecstasy was more than the fear.

00:31.103 --> 00:34.241
The first time I jumped out of an airplane, I thought I was gonna die,...

00:35.349 --> 00:38.289
...and as I fell, I thought,  "What a mistake."

00:38.447 --> 00:39.199
"This is death."

00:39.699 --> 00:41.001
I could remember it now,...

00:41.450 --> 00:44.919
...and then the next second, I thought, "Ah! I'm flying!"

00:48.654 --> 00:52.971
Skydiving gives you the most intense, wonderful feeling.

00:53.274 --> 00:56.087
I think sometimes we get pulled down by fear.

00:56.432 --> 01:01.336
We get pulled down by necessity of work and it's a mistake.

01:02.113 --> 01:05.143
But having done skydive, I learned courage.

01:05.551 --> 01:06.481
I learned to go,...

01:07.029 --> 01:09.666
...and that has been the biggest turning point in my life.
