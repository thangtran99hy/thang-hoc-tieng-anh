ï»¿This year, there are a lot of amazing contenders.

00:04.779 --> 00:06.133
Maybe the winner will be a comedy...

00:07.992 --> 00:08.699
...or a drama...

00:10.263 --> 00:13.649
...or an action film with state-of-the-art special effects.

00:16.413 --> 00:17.677
There might be a big reveal,...

00:19.349 --> 00:20.253
...a memorable song,...

00:22.275 --> 00:23.275
...an unlikely villain,...

00:25.470 --> 00:27.143
...an unexpected true love story.

00:27.324 --> 00:28.338
That's always a crowd-pleaser.

00:29.095 --> 00:31.847
Truth is, even a single standout performance...

00:31.929 --> 00:33.535
...could put any one of them over the top.

00:34.577 --> 00:35.640
But whether it's a thriller,...

00:37.005 --> 00:37.758
...a romcom,...

00:39.317 --> 00:40.031
...a horror movie,...

00:42.383 --> 00:43.378
...or a foreign film.

00:46.179 --> 00:50.948
The award for best picture will always belong to you.
