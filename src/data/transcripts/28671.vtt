00:02.668 --> 00:03.919
Emma Stone and I used to date.

00:06.977 --> 00:08.745
We've been dating since we were about two years old...

00:08.857 --> 00:11.701
...and we had a very public breakup in the middle of a playground.

00:11.918 --> 00:14.451
My favorite dress is a brown paper bag.

00:18.227 --> 00:21.557
It was such a bad physical fight, we just started hurling children at each other.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.682

00:34.689 --> 00:36.038
I'm proud to say and I don't want to boast...

00:36.237 --> 00:40.757
...but I am a five-time Best Actor defender tonight and I'm so excited about that.

00:40.987 --> 00:46.295

00:46.439 --> 00:48.023

00:50.008 --> 00:53.296
I have an IQ of 290.

00:53.653 --> 00:55.503

01:06.189 --> 01:07.088
I can still throw a few.

01:07.273 --> 01:10.687
