Hi, my name is Gordon Ramsay.

00:01.253 --> 00:02.461
Welcome to Chef Support.

00:02.707 --> 00:04.609
Today, we'll be doing Twitter.

00:07.594 --> 00:08.013
Right.

00:08.796 --> 00:09.414
First question.

00:09.531 --> 00:09.823
Hannah.

00:10.244 --> 00:12.584
Question to those of you who are good in a kitchen,...

00:12.663 --> 00:14.473
...how do I mince garlic without a press?

00:14.906 --> 00:15.389
I'm going to show you.

00:16.414 --> 00:17.284
Take the clove of garlic.

00:18.129 --> 00:19.367
This part of the knife, on there.

00:19.470 --> 00:20.392
And, literally, hand on there.

00:20.897 --> 00:22.619
And that is super minced.

00:23.477 --> 00:24.839
Touch of salt in there...

00:25.447 --> 00:26.039
...and just chop it.

00:27.268 --> 00:29.539
And within seconds, you got this paste...

00:29.707 --> 00:31.813
...because look, the salt keeps it together...

00:32.424 --> 00:35.484
...and it stops it from oozing out unto the board.

00:35.944 --> 00:38.011
In ten seconds, you got this beautiful minced garlic.

00:38.779 --> 00:39.626
The back of the knife.

00:40.219 --> 00:40.663
Good question.

00:41.191 --> 00:42.244
Now, can cheese go bad?

00:42.465 --> 00:45.573
I'm eating this cheese and it tastes funny but I'm a bit hungry.

00:45.848 --> 00:46.297
Come on, Adam.

00:46.828 --> 00:47.106
Seriously?

00:47.662 --> 00:49.768
The worst thing to do with cheese is take it out of the fridge,...

00:49.861 --> 00:51.674
...let it get up to room temperature,...

00:51.934 --> 00:54.233
...leave it out for 24 hours and then refrigerate it.

00:54.303 --> 00:55.120
That's the worst thing you can do.

00:55.284 --> 00:57.377
Once you've taken it out and it's gotten really runny,...

00:57.728 --> 00:59.075
...you have to eat it or discard it.
