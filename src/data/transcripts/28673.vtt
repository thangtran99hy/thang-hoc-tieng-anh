When we're connected, it means we all believe in each other.

00:04.889 --> 00:08.027
And I believe that you can do whatever you want, whenever you want.

00:08.699 --> 00:09.212
So, do it.

00:10.030 --> 00:13.691
I realized that I had a purpose, and it wasn't just about me.

00:14.834 --> 00:18.192
Together, we can show the world how awesome it is to support one another...

00:18.302 --> 00:19.397
...and build women up.

00:19.567 --> 00:24.537
There is nothing more powerful than a group of determined sisters.

00:28.744 --> 00:30.647
Let us fight with love.

00:31.361 --> 00:35.785
When somebody underestimated me, it made me want to prove them wrong.

00:37.433 --> 00:39.603
You know what, perfection isn't real.

00:40.090 --> 00:43.172
You are great, don't worry about what anybody else thinks of you.

00:43.350 --> 00:45.656
So many people around the world have a very negative idea...

00:45.718 --> 00:46.882
...of what Muslim women are like.

00:47.091 --> 00:47.856
It's pretty simple.

00:48.531 --> 00:49.053
We're awesome.

00:50.340 --> 00:51.257
I'm not a lone voice.

00:52.313 --> 00:52.814
I am many.

00:55.342 --> 00:56.287
I am Malala.

00:58.244 --> 00:59.607
But I'm also Shazia.

01:00.291 --> 01:01.223
I am Kainat.
