Hey there!

00:00.880 --> 00:02.449
Welcome to Life Noggin.

00:02.746 --> 00:05.130
Do you really need to have any friends?

00:05.256 --> 00:06.259
Besides me, of course.

00:06.369 --> 00:08.643
Would it be better to have no friends at all?

00:08.769 --> 00:09.497
I sure hope not.

00:09.656 --> 00:13.282
I doubt my animator would make me anymore if he thought we weren't buddies.

00:13.467 --> 00:16.540
But for the sake of science and risking my very existence,...

00:17.135 --> 00:17.785
...let's find out.

00:18.063 --> 00:21.021
Due to the research of some awesome Australian scientists,...

00:21.117 --> 00:24.503
...it looks like having friends helps keep you alive longer.

00:24.737 --> 00:27.918
They found that with older Australians, a strong network of friends...

00:28.013 --> 00:31.039
...increased their chances of survival and living longer lives,...

00:31.383 --> 00:34.733
...even more so than with connections to children and other family.

00:34.863 --> 00:38.899
This could be due to friends having more influence in your decisions and choices.

00:39.114 --> 00:40.443
Blood may be thicker than water,...

00:40.547 --> 00:43.701
...but it looks like we still need that wonderful friendship H2O...

00:43.771 --> 00:47.846
...so we can ride the great waterslide of life or something.

00:48.276 --> 00:50.032
It also seems that having more friends...

00:50.116 --> 00:53.095
...reduces your chances of making risky decisions in life.

00:53.331 --> 00:56.425
Looking at a recent study, researchers found that people tend to seek out...

00:56.520 --> 00:59.897
...money as a way to secure what they want out of the social system.

01:00.026 --> 01:02.579
They found that feeling lonely or socially rejected...

01:02.683 --> 01:07.084
...caused people to be more likely to choose riskier decisions in a gambling experiment.

01:07.269 --> 01:10.483
Now, that might work out fine if you get lucky and the risk pays off,...

01:10.635 --> 01:14.120
...but it's probably better to not base financial decisions off your emotions...

01:14.421 --> 01:16.797
...and rather use that sweet noggin of yours.
