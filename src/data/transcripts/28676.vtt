There are many theories that attempt to quantify...

00:02.880 --> 00:06.133
...the number of hours, days and even years of practice...

00:06.440 --> 00:07.991
...that it takes to master a skill.

00:08.952 --> 00:10.787
While we don't yet have a magic number,...

00:11.065 --> 00:15.553
...we do know that mastery isn't simply about the amount of hours of practice.

00:15.953 --> 00:18.737
It's also the quality and effectiveness of that practice.

00:19.726 --> 00:23.051
Effective practice is consistent, intensely focused,...

00:23.326 --> 00:28.697
...and targets content or weaknesses that lie at the edge of one's current abilities.

00:29.625 --> 00:31.614
So, if effective practice is the key,...

00:31.873 --> 00:34.201
...how can we get the most out of our practice time?

00:34.823 --> 00:35.597
Try these tips.

00:36.655 --> 00:38.258
Focus on the task at hand.

00:38.813 --> 00:42.482
Minimize potential distractions by turning off the computer or TV...

00:42.729 --> 00:44.751
...and putting your cellphone on airplane mode.

00:45.144 --> 00:47.277
Start out slowly or in slow motion.

00:47.639 --> 00:52.024
Coordination is built with repetitions, whether correct or incorrect.
