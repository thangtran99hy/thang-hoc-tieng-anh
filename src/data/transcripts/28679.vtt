00:00.651 --> 00:03.261
We chose Shenzhen really because it's the capital for hardware.

00:03.371 --> 00:04.618
All the suppliers are here.

00:05.295 --> 00:11.798
You've got an ecosystem of both manufacturers and also, critically, engineering expertise.

00:12.431 --> 00:16.767
Thirty years ago, the southern Chinese city bordering Hong Kong was just a sleepy fishing village.

00:17.775 --> 00:20.693
But now Shenzhen has become a metropolis with 11 million people...

00:20.751 --> 00:24.349
...since its designation as China's first special economic zone in 1980.

00:25.245 --> 00:30.165
It is home to some of China's most successful tech companies like Huawei, Tencent and DJI.

00:31.229 --> 00:34.329
Almost 40,000 foreign invested companies also set foot here.

00:34.821 --> 00:39.777
When I first came here, it was generally senior engineers...

00:39.921 --> 00:43.123
...that were working for large American or European companies.

00:43.735 --> 00:44.896
That's completely changed.

00:45.193 --> 00:50.962
But what you tend to get more of is the younger entrepreneurial or the R&D engineers...

00:51.223 --> 00:53.426
...that are here to kinda create the next product.

00:54.025 --> 00:57.519
Your computer, phone or TV probably got started in Shenzhen.

00:58.180 --> 01:01.435
In 2015 alone, the city exported electronic equipment...

01:01.569 --> 01:04.766
...in part with a total value of 29 billion US dollars.
