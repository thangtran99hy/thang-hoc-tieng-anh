00:02.289 --> 00:05.159
I see this life like a swinging vine,...

00:05.259 --> 00:07.389
...swing my heart across the line.

00:07.457 --> 00:09.492
In my face is flashing signs.

00:09.728 --> 00:11.533
"Seek it out and ye shall find."

00:11.635 --> 00:13.569
Old, but I'm not that old.

00:13.665 --> 00:15.598
Young, but I'm not that bold.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.803
And I don't think the world is sold...

00:18.034 --> 00:20.082
...on just doing what we're told.

00:22.576 --> 00:24.583
I feel something so right...

00:25.147 --> 00:27.261
...doing the wrong thing.

00:28.891 --> 00:33.025
I feel something so wrong...

00:33.597 --> 00:36.176
...doing the right thing.

00:37.299 --> 00:40.783
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie.

00:40.967 --> 00:45.556
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive.

00:49.118 --> 00:52.693
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep,...

00:53.628 --> 00:56.922
...dreaming about the things that we could be.

00:57.569 --> 01:01.065
And baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,...

01:02.015 --> 01:03.576
...said no more counting dollars,...

01:03.839 --> 01:05.435
...we'll be counting stars.

01:05.961 --> 01:09.469
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep,...

01:10.419 --> 01:14.141
...dreaming about the things that we could be.

01:14.277 --> 01:17.813
And baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,...

01:18.726 --> 01:20.574
...said no more counting dollars,...

01:20.663 --> 01:25.351
...we'll be counting, we'll be counting stars.
