00:00.030 --> 00:02.263
So, this is the first meaning of "be up to."

00:02.941 --> 00:06.073
Imagine a girlfriend calling her boyfriend asking him,...

00:06.533 --> 00:07.475
"What are you up to?"

00:07.681 --> 00:09.491
And he's just saying, "I'm playing Xbox."

00:10.211 --> 00:11.267
What is she asking him?

00:12.076 --> 00:13.922
She's asking him, "What are you doing?"

00:14.431 --> 00:16.498
So, this is the first meaning of "up to."

00:16.572 --> 00:18.342
It means "what are you doing."

00:21.299 --> 00:22.757
It's "be up to".

00:22.857 --> 00:24.649
So, "What are you up to?"

00:25.107 --> 00:26.857
What is he, she, it up to.

00:27.261 --> 00:30.389
Now, as an answer, it's wrong if you use it in a positive way.

00:30.508 --> 00:33.059
For example, "I'm up to playing Xbox."

00:33.194 --> 00:34.042
We wouldn't say that.

00:35.128 --> 00:38.167
However, in a negative or a question, it's okay.

00:41.471 --> 00:42.956
As a negative, it's fine.

00:43.335 --> 00:46.079
So, he could say, "I'm not up to much."

00:46.227 --> 00:49.477
Again, it just means "I'm not doing much."
