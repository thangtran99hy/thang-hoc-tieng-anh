ï»¿In late March, last year, 2016, I became a parent for the first time.

00:07.264 --> 00:08.143
Like so many parents,...

00:08.205 --> 00:12.221
...I wondered how I was going to balance my work with my new role as parent.

00:12.762 --> 00:18.908
And in that moment, I remember that the statistic for the US's policy on maternity leave...

00:19.170 --> 00:20.271
...flashed through my mind.

00:21.137 --> 00:25.043
American women are currently entitled to 12 weeks' unpaid leave.

00:25.638 --> 00:28.243
American men are entitled to nothing.

00:29.408 --> 00:36.769
Somehow, we and every American parent were expected to be "back to normal" in under three months.

00:37.561 --> 00:38.638
Without income?

00:39.527 --> 00:40.795
I remember thinking to myself,...

00:40.952 --> 00:45.527
..."If the practical reality of pregnancy is another mouth to feed in your home,...

00:45.877 --> 00:49.775
...and America is a country where most people are living paycheck to paycheck,...

00:50.366 --> 00:53.385
...how does 12 weeks' unpaid leave economically work?"

00:54.571 --> 00:56.719
The truth is, for too many people, it doesn't.

00:57.428 --> 01:02.702
One in four American women go back to work two weeks after giving birth...

01:02.808 --> 01:05.106
...because they can't afford to take off any more time than that.

01:05.376 --> 01:08.287
That's 25 percent of American women.

01:09.611 --> 01:12.891
Equally disturbing, women who can afford to take a full 12 weeks...

01:12.988 --> 01:16.405
...often don't because it will mean incurring a "motherhood penalty,"...

01:16.927 --> 01:19.821
...meaning they will be perceived as less dedicated to their job...

01:20.055 --> 01:23.322
...and will be passed over for promotions and other career advancement.
