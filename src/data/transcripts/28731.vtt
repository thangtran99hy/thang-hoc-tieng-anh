I'm really passionate about climate change.

00:11.178 --> 00:14.381
I'm worried that there won't be enough fresh water for everybody.

00:14.440 --> 00:18.113
I wanna make sure that we're able to have a self-sustaining environment.

00:18.267 --> 00:22.619
My interest is to find a cure for breast cancer because my mom had it.

00:38.801 --> 00:41.127
The cracks are probably where the water is.

00:43.231 --> 00:44.396
Seeing stuff like this...

00:44.471 --> 00:46.590
And I think, I wanna be able to help do that.

00:46.877 --> 00:49.087
It makes me feel like, unstoppable.

01:02.306 --> 01:04.262
That makes no sense to me.

01:04.331 --> 01:05.679
Like, why would that be?

01:06.327 --> 01:09.451
There is always going to be someone that says like, "No, you can't do it."

01:09.560 --> 01:10.393
I think I can.

01:10.456 --> 01:11.942
We're as amazing as men.

01:12.045 --> 01:14.097
Like, we can do as much stuff as they can.

01:14.461 --> 01:15.955
I want my name to be there and be like,...

01:16.339 --> 01:18.983
...."Marley was the one who helped stop this climate change issue."

01:19.222 --> 01:21.377
I will discover a cure for breast cancer.

01:21.877 --> 01:23.621
We need all hands on deck right now.
