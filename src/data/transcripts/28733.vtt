So, take a wild success like Airbnb that everybody knows about.

00:03.303 --> 00:07.557
Well, that company was famously passed on by many smart investors 'cause people thought,...

00:07.923 --> 00:10.856
"No one's gonna rent out a space in their home to a stranger."

00:10.993 --> 00:12.510
Of course, people proved that wrong.

00:12.952 --> 00:14.223
But one of the reasons it succeeded,...

00:14.299 --> 00:18.571
...aside from a good business model, a good idea, great execution, is the timing.

00:18.714 --> 00:21.791
That company came out right during the height of the recession...

00:22.107 --> 00:23.725
...when people really needed extra money.

00:24.001 --> 00:25.924
And that maybe helped people overcome their objection...

00:26.038 --> 00:27.700
...to renting out their own home to a stranger.

00:28.144 --> 00:28.927
Same thing with Uber.

00:29.179 --> 00:32.970
Uber came out, incredible company, incredible business model, great execution, too...

00:33.079 --> 00:37.385
..but the timing was so perfect for their need to get drivers into the system.

00:37.501 --> 00:38.891
Drivers were looking for extra money.

00:39.125 --> 00:40.243
It was very very important.

00:40.957 --> 00:44.127
Some of our early successes, Citysearch, came out when people needed web pages.

00:44.516 --> 00:47.144
GoTo.com, which we announced actually at TED in 1998,...

00:47.368 --> 00:49.981
...was when companies were looking for cost-effective ways to get traffic.

00:50.264 --> 00:51.461
We thought the idea was so great,...

00:51.549 --> 00:53.641
...but actually, the timing was probably maybe more important.
