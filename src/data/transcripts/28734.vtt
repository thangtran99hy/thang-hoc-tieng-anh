So, why are American tech companies jealous of WeChat...

00:04.892 --> 00:07.273
...or maybe even copying them a little bit?

00:08.197 --> 00:10.047
It's because WeChat is very sticky.

00:10.127 --> 00:10.727
Sticky.

00:11.675 --> 00:12.113
Sticky.

00:13.157 --> 00:16.650
You know, meaning users like me never have to leave the app to hail a cab,...

00:16.722 --> 00:18.560
...or transfer money, or order food.

00:19.915 --> 00:25.583
So, imagine if Tinder and Paypal, Apple Pay, Groupon, Yelp, Facebook,...

00:25.707 --> 00:27.697
...Amazon and Uber were all rolled into one app.

00:28.089 --> 00:28.903
That would be WeChat.

00:30.248 --> 00:33.005
Payment is kind of key because that's how you keep people inside the app, right?

00:33.401 --> 00:37.349
That you're turning your social network into a platform for other services.

00:39.264 --> 00:43.345
So sort of the WeChat experience may actually be coming to the U.S. pretty soon.

00:43.685 --> 00:46.872
Mark Zuckerberg announced his vision for Facebook Messenger.

00:47.101 --> 00:49.606
It sounded a lot like what we can already do on WeChat.

00:51.743 --> 00:53.915
We think that you should just be able to message a business...

00:54.454 --> 00:55.847
...in the same way you message a friend.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.601
Take 1-800-Flowers.

00:58.831 --> 01:00.045
You don't have to install a new app...

01:01.019 --> 01:02.209
...or enter your credit card again.

01:02.643 --> 01:03.554
You just send a message.
