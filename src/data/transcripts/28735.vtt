Look, can you see them, Emma?

00:02.870 --> 00:03.617
Oh, hi!

00:03.871 --> 00:05.592
How can I be a good boyfriend?

00:07.181 --> 00:10.390
Well, just even by asking the question you're an amazing boyfriend.

00:10.825 --> 00:12.623
I think really it's just being kind...

00:13.379 --> 00:15.390
...in any way that you can.

00:15.707 --> 00:17.236
And dancing!

00:17.529 --> 00:18.537
Oh, you should dance with her!

00:18.924 --> 00:20.383
Boys that dance are so great.

00:20.637 --> 00:21.712
Lovely to meet you both.

00:21.919 --> 00:22.356
Good luck!

00:23.179 --> 00:25.747
How do I drop my career and become an actor?

00:25.839 --> 00:26.313
What do you think?

00:26.821 --> 00:27.509
That's awesome.

00:27.691 --> 00:30.701
You seem like the kind of person you'd wanna watch.

00:30.986 --> 00:32.732
I want to be a film director.

00:32.953 --> 00:35.970
Do what you love and make films about what you love.

00:36.539 --> 00:39.127
You can argue  yourself into making decisions...

00:39.313 --> 00:43.475
...that don't have heart behind  them and they're never the right ones.

00:43.819 --> 00:47.645
Just always follow the things that feel the most right to you.

00:47.985 --> 00:49.088
Thank you so much.

00:49.522 --> 00:50.115
Pleasure.

00:51.168 --> 00:51.857
Emma, how was that?

00:52.295 --> 00:52.972
It was awesome.

00:53.225 --> 00:54.533
I think you gave very good advice.

00:54.711 --> 00:55.643
Thanks, Derek.

00:56.081 --> 00:57.143
What am I gonna do with all this stuff?

00:57.572 --> 00:58.616
Oh my God, the money!

00:58.931 --> 01:00.071
It has to go to Planned Parenthood.

01:00.518 --> 01:01.244
Planned Parenthood.

01:02.149 --> 01:02.818
Planned Parenthood.

01:02.951 --> 01:03.307
You got it.

01:03.380 --> 01:03.991
They're the best.

01:04.257 --> 01:05.732
Any other last-minute advice?

01:06.250 --> 01:07.961
Keep loving life, New York City.

01:08.349 --> 01:09.829
You're the greatest city in the world.
