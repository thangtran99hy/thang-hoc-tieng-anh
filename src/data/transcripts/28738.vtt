00:00.137 --> 00:02.267
You had pretty ambitious sales targets.

00:02.470 --> 00:03.801
Are you gonna be able to hit those?

00:03.939 --> 00:05.263
You'll never know until the last minute.

00:06.346 --> 00:08.919
The objective of, when you make a long-term plan,...

00:08.991 --> 00:11.099
...is not to make sure from the beginning that you're gonna hit them...

00:11.211 --> 00:13.869
...because, if you are sure from the beginning that you're gonna hit all your targets,...

00:13.942 --> 00:15.203
...that means your targets are conservative.

00:15.992 --> 00:17.715
That's the only way you can be sure.

00:18.029 --> 00:21.693
So, you want to maintain a certain stretch inside the company...

00:22.141 --> 00:24.384
...and being innovative and creative,...

00:24.638 --> 00:26.969
...and finding new products and new solutions...

00:27.083 --> 00:28.083
...in order to hit the target.
