00:14.043 --> 00:14.978
We have to be ready,...

00:16.439 --> 00:18.148
...you, me, the others.

00:19.701 --> 00:20.813
There's an attack coming...

00:21.710 --> 00:22.539
...from far away.

00:24.343 --> 00:25.357
Not coming, Bruce.

00:27.354 --> 00:28.226
It's already here.

00:33.328 --> 00:34.016
The others,...

00:35.279 --> 00:35.919
...where are they?

00:39.991 --> 00:40.756
Arthur Curry.

00:41.915 --> 00:42.594
The Aquaman.

00:44.305 --> 00:44.717
It's on him.

00:45.965 --> 00:48.344
Organic and biomechatronic body parts.

00:49.808 --> 00:50.499
He's a cyborg.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.065
You should probably move.

00:55.358 --> 00:55.977
Barry Allen.

00:57.879 --> 00:59.853
Whoever you're looking for, it's not me.

01:03.591 --> 01:04.207
You're the Batman?

01:08.205 --> 01:10.144
They said the age of heroes would never come again.

01:11.671 --> 01:12.227
It has to.

01:31.823 --> 01:32.345
Shall we?
