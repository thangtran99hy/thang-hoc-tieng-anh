I was six feet tall when I was in seventh grade,...

00:07.734 --> 00:10.686
...pretty awkward and not super confident in school.

00:10.867 --> 00:12.191
I took a Home Ec class.

00:13.061 --> 00:14.247
I don't even think they have those anymore.

00:14.707 --> 00:17.435
That year, I made myself a full-length watermelon skirt...

00:17.610 --> 00:20.665
...and everyone in class asked me where I got my skirt.

00:21.436 --> 00:24.638
That was the first time I'd ever gotten positive attention for how I looked.

00:24.734 --> 00:28.273
I sort of became fascinated by the world of making things and clothes.

00:28.918 --> 00:30.403
My grandmother gave me a sewing machine...

00:30.992 --> 00:32.243
...and a subscription to Vogue.

00:32.819 --> 00:33.991
It opened up a whole new world.
