Excuse me, are you aware of what's happening right now?

00:04.320 --> 00:06.831
We're facing 20 billion security events every day:...

00:06.967 --> 00:09.422
...DDoS campaigns, ransomware, malware attacks.

00:09.501 --> 00:11.857
Actually, we just handled all the priority threats.

00:12.219 --> 00:12.615
You did that?

00:12.964 --> 00:13.501
We did that.

00:14.238 --> 00:14.572
Really?

00:14.796 --> 00:16.589
We analyze millions of articles and reports.

00:16.833 --> 00:19.500
We can identify threats 50% faster.

00:19.835 --> 00:20.366
You can do that?

00:20.634 --> 00:21.175
We can do that.

00:21.946 --> 00:22.443
Then, do that.

00:25.591 --> 00:26.196
Can we do that?

00:27.247 --> 00:27.889
We can do that.
