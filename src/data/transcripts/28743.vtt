ï»¿Snap is a camera company.

00:05.044 --> 00:08.283
We feel like we're really at the beginning of what cameras can do.

00:08.846 --> 00:12.129
Cameras have evolved from being just a piece of hardware like a chip...

00:12.523 --> 00:14.317
...to software that's connected to the internet.

00:15.155 --> 00:18.905
Before cameras were the best way to perfectly save...

00:18.993 --> 00:23.370
...or record something that you saw and they sort of helped augment memory.

00:23.819 --> 00:26.879
But now, you know, cameras augment the way that we talk.

00:27.496 --> 00:29.143
You know, if you think about the keyboard...

00:29.223 --> 00:31.631
...and the way that sort of became the primary input...

00:31.835 --> 00:33.313
...for everything you do on your computer...

00:33.555 --> 00:35.410
...you know everything starts with that flashing cursor.

00:35.754 --> 00:39.930
With Snapchat, the camera has become the primary input for the phone.

00:40.364 --> 00:43.644
Throughout history, people have wanted to communicate in intimate ways...

00:44.207 --> 00:47.717
...whether it's the handwriting on a letter that reveals someone's personality...

00:47.787 --> 00:49.568
...or the sound of their voice.

00:49.696 --> 00:53.095
I can't imagine the way it must have felt on that first phone call...

00:53.299 --> 00:55.833
...when you could hear the other person's voice in real time...

00:55.937 --> 00:57.983
...coming through the phone, all that emotion.

00:58.598 --> 01:02.205
I think Snapchat really tapped into that human desire to communicate...

01:02.352 --> 01:06.081
...in a way that feels like it's face-to-face even if you're far away.

01:06.847 --> 01:09.767
The first time you use it and you can see what someone else is seeing...

01:10.572 --> 01:12.384
...at the same time, from their perspective.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.493
That moment, it makes you feel close.
