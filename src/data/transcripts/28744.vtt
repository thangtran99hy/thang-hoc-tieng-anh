ï»¿George.

00:07.433 --> 00:09.972
George has been monkeying around in the supermarket.

00:10.588 --> 00:14.096
Can you help him put each grocery item back where it belongs?

00:27.395 --> 00:28.451
That looks perfect.

00:29.016 --> 00:30.341
Thanks for helping George.

00:31.105 --> 00:31.547
George?

00:32.531 --> 00:33.324
George!

00:41.132 --> 00:41.947
Not again.

00:42.628 --> 00:45.275
Now, the fruits and vegetables are all mixed up.

00:45.974 --> 00:49.281
George needs your help to get the produce section back in order.

01:03.682 --> 01:05.152
There are still more to put away.

01:17.562 --> 01:18.587
Nice job.

01:18.920 --> 01:20.761
Everything is right where it belongs.
