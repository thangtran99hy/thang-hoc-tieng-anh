ï»¿We live our lives through our phones.

00:05.460 --> 00:07.817
They're now our screens of choice to enjoy everything...

00:07.874 --> 00:10.089
...from TV shows to mind-blowing games.

00:11.253 --> 00:14.461
But smartphones still look the same as they did a decade ago:...

00:15.449 --> 00:17.118
...buttons, bezels and frames,...

00:17.339 --> 00:18.135
...that all get in our way...

00:19.707 --> 00:20.216
...until now.

00:21.902 --> 00:22.774
Unbox your phone.

00:23.503 --> 00:24.933
Samsung Galaxy S8.

00:30.853 --> 00:34.968
The new Infinity Display gives you an incredible fullscreen experience,...

00:35.198 --> 00:36.729
...yet fits comfortably in your hand.

00:39.325 --> 00:42.116
We created it by reorganizing the phone's interior,...

00:42.651 --> 00:46.262
...making components smaller without sacrificing performance...

00:46.877 --> 00:48.830
...and embedding the home button under the screen.

00:50.188 --> 00:52.501
We created the beautifully-curved edge display...

00:52.993 --> 00:57.266
...and also erased the bezels to give you more space for the things that matter.

00:59.511 --> 01:02.439
The Galaxy S8 will take you beyond the limits of any phone...

01:02.521 --> 01:03.690
...you've ever known before.

01:05.992 --> 01:06.811
Unbox your phone.

01:07.853 --> 01:10.241
Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+.
