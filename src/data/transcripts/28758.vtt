ï»¿My name is Ioannis Ikonomou.

00:03.229 --> 00:05.392
I'm from Greece and I speak 32 languages.

00:05.621 --> 00:10.393
Russian, Portuguese, Norwegian, Turkish, Hungarian, Czech, Polish...

00:10.476 --> 00:12.935
Ioannis is what we call a "hyperpolyglot."

00:13.628 --> 00:15.983
It means he can speak a lot of languages.

00:16.155 --> 00:21.053
By the time I was 20, I'd already learned some 15 languages...

00:21.443 --> 00:25.741
...and when I moved to Brussels and started my career at the EU institutions,...

00:25.819 --> 00:28.676
...I added more official EU languages.

00:29.987 --> 00:32.857
This doesn't happen by just sitting at home and studying them.

00:33.018 --> 00:35.397
I speak to my husband in Polish because he is Polish.

00:35.583 --> 00:37.681
I dream in all kinds of languages.

00:42.479 --> 00:46.099
Wait wait, before we go, if anyone knows it's you,...

00:46.497 --> 00:48.809
...what is the most complicated language to learn?

00:49.731 --> 00:50.520
Mandarin.

00:51.162 --> 00:52.637
Mystery solved.
