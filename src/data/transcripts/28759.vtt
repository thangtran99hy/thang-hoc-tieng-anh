00:14.421 --> 00:19.270
One day Pam said to Sam, "Will you eat some of my jam?"

00:21.611 --> 00:24.021
Sam said he would not eat jam!

00:26.295 --> 00:28.847
Pam said she would not eat ham!

00:31.108 --> 00:34.043
"I have a plan," Pam said to Sam.

00:34.537 --> 00:36.980
"Maybe jam tastes good on ham!"

Pam took out her jar of jam.

00:44.291 --> 00:46.518
She put some on a piece of ham.

00:49.062 --> 00:51.995

01:03.098 --> 01:05.343

01:13.999 --> 01:18.456
And Pam told Sam, "Now I like ham!"

01:21.237 --> 01:22.210
The End.
