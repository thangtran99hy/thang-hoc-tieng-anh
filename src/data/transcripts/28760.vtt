00:00.231 --> 00:01.775
ï»¿I'm starting the day with a little breakfast.

00:01.900 --> 00:05.707
This is menemen, which is eggs served with tomatoes and bread.

00:06.261 --> 00:07.653
Very common Turkish dish.

00:07.975 --> 00:11.456
This is a good start to eating Turkish food.

00:11.983 --> 00:14.481
Alright, so I just bought simit, which is like a street bagel,...

00:15.049 --> 00:17.848
...and it's got cheese inside.

00:18.291 --> 00:20.490
So, you see these things all over Istanbul...

00:20.828 --> 00:22.321
...and I was really curious how they would taste.

00:25.105 --> 00:26.101
Basically just a bagel.

00:26.314 --> 00:28.305
We are in the Asian side of Istanbul.

00:28.628 --> 00:29.689
This is known as ayran.

00:30.164 --> 00:34.125
An ayran is water mixed with yogurt and salt.

00:34.557 --> 00:36.442
It's definitely a little bit salty.

00:36.535 --> 00:38.623
It tastes kind of sour to me.
