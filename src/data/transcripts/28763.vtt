If you ever get to travel to China or even go to your local Chinese restaurant,...

00:07.554 --> 00:10.325
...you'll want to know a little about Chinese mealtime manners...

00:10.606 --> 00:12.583
...and a few basics of chopstick use.

00:13.125 --> 00:16.420
It is bad manners to tap chopsticks on the edge of your bowl.

00:16.789 --> 00:20.291
At one time, beggars made this sort of noise to attract attention.

00:21.082 --> 00:23.646
It is impolite to spear food with a chopstick.

00:24.455 --> 00:28.793
Anything too difficult to be handled with chopsticks is usually eaten with a spoon.

00:29.535 --> 00:33.633
It is considered bad manners to point chopsticks toward others seated at the table.

00:34.564 --> 00:37.661
Chopsticks should not be left vertically stuck into a bowl of rice...

00:38.024 --> 00:40.378
...because it looks like the ritual of incense burning...

00:40.803 --> 00:43.669
...that symbolizes feeding the dead and death, in general.

00:44.327 --> 00:48.550
Be careful not to dig or search through your food for something in particular.

00:49.079 --> 00:52.713
This is sometimes known as digging one's grave or grave digging...

00:53.019 --> 00:54.363
...and is extremely impolite.

00:55.098 --> 00:58.283
Putting your chopsticks at the top of the bowl means "I've finished."

00:59.155 --> 01:02.733
Putting your chopsticks on the side of your bowl or on a chopstick stand...

01:03.017 --> 01:05.133
...means that you're just taking a break from eating.

01:06.826 --> 01:08.899
Remember to chew with your mouth closed.

01:09.237 --> 01:12.115
Finish your personal rice bowl and don't burp.

01:13.297 --> 01:15.540
In China, you should try what you are offered,...

01:15.999 --> 01:17.847
...but don't feel like you have to finish it all.

01:18.535 --> 01:21.017
If the plates are completely clean at the end of a meal,...

01:21.451 --> 01:24.081
...your host might feel that they haven't given you enough to eat.

01:25.338 --> 01:27.730
It's normal to hold the rice bowl up to your mouth...

01:27.873 --> 01:31.067
...and use chopsticks to push or scoop the rice into your mouth.
