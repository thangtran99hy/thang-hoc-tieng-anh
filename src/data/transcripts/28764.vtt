If you ever get the chance to visit a traditional Chinese home,...

00:06.038 --> 00:08.361
...here are a few things you'll want to know and remember.

00:08.774 --> 00:12.083
Most Chinese people are happy to have guests visit their homes.

00:12.648 --> 00:14.433
You can bring a gift if you'd like.

00:14.807 --> 00:18.241
A good gift might be something like fruit or some kind of drink.

00:18.791 --> 00:21.681
You also might be offered slippers to wear while you're visiting.

00:22.260 --> 00:24.611
Remember to remove your shoes when entering the home.

00:24.942 --> 00:27.077
It's good manners and shows respect.

00:27.511 --> 00:31.691
Either you'll use slippers while you're visiting or you'll walk around in socks.

00:32.153 --> 00:34.495
It's important to most Chinese to be on time.

00:34.947 --> 00:37.319
If you are invited somewhere, don't be late.

00:37.515 --> 00:40.193
Showing up on time is respectful to other people.

00:40.561 --> 00:43.699
This is more important in big cities than it is in the countryside.

00:44.309 --> 00:47.337
Lastly, the Chinese generally don't make compliments.

00:47.793 --> 00:51.483
When visitors compliment something, the Chinese will often say the opposite.

00:51.982 --> 00:55.750
If you say a young girl is cute, they might be embarrassed about the compliment.

00:56.220 --> 00:59.715
If you say a meal is good, they might say something didn't turn out right.
