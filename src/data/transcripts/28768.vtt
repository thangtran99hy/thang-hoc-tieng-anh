A day in a Turkish family always starts with a strong breakfast...

00:04.168 --> 00:06.119
...of varied but simple produce.

00:06.869 --> 00:12.229
Being an agricultural land, most of the people will have a really heavy meal just after dawn...

00:12.425 --> 00:15.259
...and have something like a soup or bread traditionally.

00:15.563 --> 00:19.797
But in the last 100 years, with the amount of produce that is coming out of Turkey,...

00:20.127 --> 00:21.841
...it became a lot more rare item:...

00:22.200 --> 00:24.974
...different types of cheeses, fresh fruit in season,...

00:25.405 --> 00:29.701
...jams, pastries, vegetables and all-day with the Turkish tea as well.

00:30.107 --> 00:33.754
Van is a city in East Anatolia and famous for its breakfast...

00:33.851 --> 00:37.443
...defined by the variety of boutique cheeses produced around the region.

00:37.772 --> 00:42.052
Some are barrel-aged feta, fresh goat cheeses mixed with native herbs...

00:42.341 --> 00:46.162
...or another example of our fascination with stuffing food is tulum cheese:...

00:46.379 --> 00:49.191
...sheep cheese stuffed and preserved in goat skin.

00:50.034 --> 00:54.368
An abundance of Mediterranean fruits in the region is reflected on the breakfast table.

00:54.663 --> 00:58.851
Grapes, cherries, strawberries, watermelon and stone fruits...

00:58.977 --> 01:02.301
...are generally picked fresh from the garden or the market.
