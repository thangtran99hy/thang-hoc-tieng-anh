00:00.150 --> 00:01.455
Rebellions happen all the time.

00:01.706 --> 00:04.951
The question is, how did the Imperial Fleet respond to those rebellions?

00:05.063 --> 00:08.237
And what will it do to these fully-operational battles?

00:09.090 --> 00:11.151
I think one of your droids has just wandered in.

00:12.039 --> 00:14.962
I mean deeply unsettling signs as we comb the galaxy.

00:15.452 --> 00:18.017
Do you think relations with the Imperial Senate may change?

00:19.338 --> 00:20.615
I would be surprised if they do.

00:22.837 --> 00:23.253
Pardon me.

00:27.075 --> 00:27.867
My apologies.

00:33.448 --> 00:34.581
Most apologetic.

00:38.784 --> 00:39.396
Outer Rim.

00:40.318 --> 00:42.869
The Intergalactic Policy choices on the Outer Rim...

00:43.151 --> 00:45.937
...have been severely limited since the 12 parsecs Kessel Run...
