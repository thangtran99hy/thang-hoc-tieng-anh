ï»¿We made an incredible, moldable, indestructible material.

00:05.103 --> 00:08.521
But when we dump it, it doesn't go away.

00:10.249 --> 00:13.275
Now, one truck of it ends up in our oceans every minute.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.326
It's killing sea life.

00:19.769 --> 00:22.443
The fish eat the trash, then we eat the fish.

00:22.695 --> 00:26.484
We're feeding ourselves our own garbage and it's now in our bloodstreams.

00:27.587 --> 00:28.961
We've got to avoid plastic,...

00:29.425 --> 00:32.297
...we've got to get it out of the ocean and reuse it.

00:33.363 --> 00:38.761
Look, what if we took some trash and made a sports shoe out of it?

00:40.079 --> 00:43.806
And then, we made a million more from 11 million plastic bottles.

00:45.497 --> 00:47.243
What if that was just the start?

00:49.243 --> 00:50.696
And what if everyone did that?
