I grew up in the West, now I live in the East.

00:04.967 --> 00:08.817
I love both, and in my work, I always try to merge both.

00:09.537 --> 00:12.125
That's what I do and what I breathe and what I love.

00:14.835 --> 00:18.345
I try to get inspirations from different dimensions.

00:19.250 --> 00:23.324
I always walk around with my camera and I just love capturing moments.

00:23.487 --> 00:28.731
I love discovering stories, telling stories and I translate that into products.

00:30.304 --> 00:34.031
Being a creative, you really need to be open-minded.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.703
You need to be able to discover new things.

00:37.277 --> 00:38.415
There is no more boundaries.

00:38.521 --> 00:39.663
We can reach each other,...

00:39.929 --> 00:42.423
...find artists that you can relate to.

00:43.535 --> 00:44.847
I'm the proof of that.

00:45.891 --> 00:49.680
I take details from the past and I merge them with the future...

00:50.197 --> 00:52.686
...and I think that's strong and powerful.
