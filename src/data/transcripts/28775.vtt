It's been Huda's dream to open a salon that caters to women in her community.

00:04.371 --> 00:07.050
As soon as you walk in to many salons, it's an open space,...

00:07.153 --> 00:10.065
...but here, it's designed to be a beauty safe haven.

00:10.282 --> 00:12.110
It will have a small reception area,...

00:12.177 --> 00:14.841
...where men are welcome to wait for the woman in their life.

00:15.096 --> 00:17.737
But beyond these doors, no guys allowed,...

00:17.908 --> 00:20.728
...no male customers, no male employees.

00:21.087 --> 00:25.614
They can take their scarf off and they can just feel at ease as if they're at home...

00:26.187 --> 00:28.563
...and get any service that they need done.

00:28.709 --> 00:33.534
It's a sprawling interior with a bridal boutique in the basement that she designed herself.

00:33.832 --> 00:35.816
You can get your haircut, nails or makeup done....

00:35.875 --> 00:38.677
...and receive skincare treatment among other services.

00:38.837 --> 00:42.122
It's an amazing feeling to be not only a salon owner...

00:43.518 --> 00:47.427
...and not only a Muslim salon owner, but a Yemeni woman in business...

00:48.186 --> 00:51.369
...because it's a little bit more difficult in our culture...

00:51.762 --> 00:54.420
...to be able to open up a business as a woman on your own.
