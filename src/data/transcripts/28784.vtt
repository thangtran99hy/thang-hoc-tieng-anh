00:00.121 --> 00:03.581
When every effort to get your kids to bed at a reasonable hour has failed,...

00:03.832 --> 00:08.053
...it's time to fall back on Daylight Saving Fall Back.

00:08.410 --> 00:10.639
Yes, there's no S at the end of "Saving", it's so weird.

00:11.046 --> 00:13.269
On November 6, by doing nothing different,...

00:13.580 --> 00:14.745
"Put your pants on your legs."

00:14.804 --> 00:17.197
...during your semi-dysfunctional bedtime routine,...

00:18.757 --> 00:22.359
...you turn the clocks back an hour and your kid's asleep by eight.

00:23.540 --> 00:24.809
No, I did not think this through.

00:27.433 --> 00:29.506
Now, most moms will totally stress about...

00:29.669 --> 00:32.438
...how this transition affects their baby's intricate schedule.

00:32.827 --> 00:35.347
That's why I never got you on a schedule.

00:35.950 --> 00:39.541
Some moms will cry that their kids are now waking up at the crack of dawn...

00:39.718 --> 00:44.721
...but you, you look at this as an opportunity to actually be on time for preschool,...

00:45.603 --> 00:47.877
...to be an early mom.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.184
Hang on a sec, where is everyone?

00:50.561 --> 00:51.059
Guys?

00:51.207 --> 00:53.826
Oh yes, within a week, this will all start to slip away.

00:54.049 --> 00:55.615
Your kid's looking way too awake...

00:55.775 --> 00:58.697
...and one more TV show leads to another and you're back where you started,...

00:59.075 --> 01:04.695
...just in time for the evil stepsibling of Daylight Saving Fall Back, Spring Forward.

01:05.533 --> 01:06.007
Don't think about it.

01:06.093 --> 01:06.992
Forget that I brought it up.

01:07.112 --> 01:09.337
They say, "Even a broken clock is right twice a day."

01:09.587 --> 01:12.255
Well, your parenting strategy is right once a year.

01:12.635 --> 01:14.036
So, enjoy that extra hour...

01:14.271 --> 01:14.641
"Cheers."

01:14.833 --> 01:18.880
...and have a happy Daylight Savings, Saving, Fall Back.
