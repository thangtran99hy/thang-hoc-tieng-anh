"Spring forward, fall back," as the saying goes.

00:03.011 --> 00:06.616
Many countries change their clocks twice a year to observe Daylight Saving Time.

00:07.137 --> 00:10.135
The practice was first introduced in Europe during the first World War...

00:10.259 --> 00:13.251
...but was only fully adopted towards the end of the 20th century.

00:15.080 --> 00:19.726
The idea was to take advantage of the longer summer days by gaining an extra hour of daylight...

00:19.888 --> 00:21.419
...and shortening the days in winter

00:23.135 --> 00:24.474
It wasn't a new concept.

00:24.775 --> 00:28.460
Back in 1784, American inventor and politician Benjamin Franklin...

00:28.535 --> 00:30.705
...suggested that starting the day earlier in the summer...

00:30.787 --> 00:33.091
...would save a considerable number of candles.

00:35.268 --> 00:38.718
Those in favor of the practice saying today's energy-consuming society...

00:38.809 --> 00:42.077
...the environmental benefits linked to changing the clocks are considerable.

00:42.295 --> 00:46.969
While only small amounts of electricity are saved per household, added up they can be significant.

00:49.143 --> 00:53.043
Lobby groups however argue these savings are negligible, particularly in the winter...

00:53.121 --> 00:57.286
...when the afternoon advantage is offset by the need for more light in the darker mornings.

00:57.611 --> 01:01.593
Farmers cite other disadvantages, for example the unsettling effect on cows...

01:01.689 --> 01:03.233
...as milking cycles are disrupted.

01:03.515 --> 01:07.117
The elderly, the sick and children are also thought to have difficulties adapting.
