00:01.042 --> 00:02.998
Time to find my new voice.

00:03.978 --> 00:04.361
Stephen.

00:06.773 --> 00:08.689
It's me, surely it has to be me.

00:09.592 --> 00:10.781
Listen to my voice.

00:11.018 --> 00:11.514
It's deep.

00:12.161 --> 00:12.849
It's sexy.

00:13.219 --> 00:16.079
It's got a tinge of physics.

00:16.867 --> 00:21.047
Hi, I'm Rebel Wilson and I'm reading for the role of Stephen Hawking.

00:21.523 --> 00:25.945
He's a really smart guy, so I think we'd be a perfect match, really.

00:26.236 --> 00:27.716
I am the obvious choice.

00:28.123 --> 00:28.979
I'm intelligent.

00:29.499 --> 00:29.925
Kind of.

00:30.389 --> 00:32.539
And I'm young and cool.

00:33.391 --> 00:33.718
Kind of.

00:34.410 --> 00:36.153
Hello Stephen, it's Stephen here.

00:36.851 --> 00:42.215
Listen, I think my voice would endow your presence with an enormous authority.

00:42.623 --> 00:45.367
You'll also be able to use many cogently...

00:47.180 --> 00:48.155
My earpiece is gone.

00:49.799 --> 00:54.383
You'd be able to use lots of long words and stuff.

00:54.919 --> 00:56.020
Are you kidding me?

00:57.057 --> 00:59.900
A number of people decided to do what they do best.

01:00.255 --> 01:01.757
My job is to find stars.

01:02.196 --> 01:05.207
Your job is to look at them, count them, whatever it is you do.

01:05.370 --> 01:08.312
Did Liam Neeson do the whole phone call, like...

01:08.870 --> 01:10.136
I don't know who you are.

01:10.870 --> 01:12.007
I don't know what you want.

01:12.664 --> 01:13.106
Did he?

01:15.440 --> 01:17.978
It has to be a yes from you.

01:18.354 --> 01:18.700
No.

01:19.039 --> 01:19.993
Not a chance.
