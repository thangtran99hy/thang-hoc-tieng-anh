Approximately 750,000 years ago,...

00:06.962 --> 00:09.269
...three volcanoes converged to form Easter Island,...

00:09.853 --> 00:13.016
...located about 3,500 miles off the Chilean coast.

00:13.735 --> 00:17.247
Easter Island was named after the date it was discovered in 1722...

00:17.733 --> 00:21.699
...by the Dutch explorer, Jacob Roggeveen, who was in search of Terra Australis.

00:22.027 --> 00:25.811
Perhaps the most iconic feature of Easter Island is the Moai statues.

00:26.482 --> 00:31.123
They stand as tall as 30 feet and are head-to-thigh carvings of venerated ancestors.

00:31.806 --> 00:36.309
It is still uncertain exactly how they were moved in such great distances.
