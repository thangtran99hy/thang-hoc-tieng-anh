00:01.816 --> 00:07.648
One day, we will wake up to find that the energy that powers the alarm clock...

00:08.814 --> 00:12.975
...came from the breeze through the trees the night before...

00:15.742 --> 00:19.531
...and we will go to work that morning riding the rays of the sun.

00:20.451 --> 00:26.159
It will light our cities and power our businesses.

00:27.584 --> 00:31.001
It will warm our homes and cool our workplaces.

00:31.987 --> 00:36.457
It will reduce sources of conflict and fuel our economies.

00:37.551 --> 00:40.102
It will connect us all.

00:41.698 --> 00:46.231
It won't scar the land or poison the seas.

00:49.804 --> 00:54.955
The food we eat will be good for our bodies and good for the planet...

00:56.841 --> 01:00.569
...and the weather that day won't make us worry for tomorrow.

01:02.180 --> 01:06.155
There will be more jobs and less disease.

01:08.119 --> 01:16.862
The sea level will stop rising and species will stop dying.

01:18.151 --> 01:20.825
We can't wait until tomorrow.

01:28.997 --> 01:31.734
This is our only home.

01:32.144 --> 01:36.429
You can choose today to make a world of difference.
