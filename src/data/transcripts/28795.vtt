00:00.043 --> 00:02.089
I'm just gonna dive right in guys.

00:02.889 --> 00:03.238
Okay.

00:03.513 --> 00:06.049
So, we're really looking to freshen up our identity,...

00:06.167 --> 00:08.177
...make our brand really stand alone.

00:08.250 --> 00:10.364
We want this to look totally premium...

00:10.450 --> 00:11.419
...with a serious edge.

00:11.505 --> 00:12.440
Serious edge, guys.

00:12.502 --> 00:12.589
Yeah.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.312
So, something with a different feel.

00:14.438 --> 00:14.590
Yeah.

00:14.664 --> 00:15.359
Exactly.

00:15.892 --> 00:16.383
I don't know.

00:16.465 --> 00:17.789
Maybe some quirky little characters.

00:18.755 --> 00:19.047
Awesome.

00:19.446 --> 00:20.535
Quirky characters.

00:21.327 --> 00:21.634
Right.

00:21.825 --> 00:23.757
Okay, so you're looking for something really unique.

00:23.940 --> 00:24.476
No, no.

00:24.610 --> 00:28.149
Not just unique, Ted, something truly brilliant on a grand scale.

00:28.259 --> 00:28.484
Right.

00:28.639 --> 00:29.457
You mean something big?

00:30.497 --> 00:32.021
No Ted, bigger than big.

00:32.345 --> 00:33.847
I'm thinking of something epic!

00:35.809 --> 00:37.811
But what about making something tiny?

00:38.289 --> 00:39.345
Really tiny?

00:39.525 --> 00:41.541
No, really, really tiny...

00:42.016 --> 00:43.294
...and precious.

00:43.626 --> 00:44.615
That sounds totally doable.

00:45.635 --> 00:48.335
I think it needs to be a lot more edgy, more abstract.

00:48.425 --> 00:49.608
Maybe just like in black and white.

00:49.680 --> 00:50.370
Exactly!

00:50.452 --> 00:51.552
But with a bit of color.

00:52.143 --> 00:53.307
Actually scratch that.

00:53.379 --> 00:57.357
Ideally, we really want it to look sweet, I mean, cute but not really.

00:58.517 --> 01:00.023
I totally visualize it now.

01:00.096 --> 01:01.331
Nothing weird though, Ted, okay?
