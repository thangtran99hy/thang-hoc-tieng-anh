ï»¿Hello.

00:02.624 --> 00:03.459
I'm Justin Bieber,...

00:03.998 --> 00:04.976
...Celebration Expert.

00:05.343 --> 00:06.939
First, there was the high five.

00:08.519 --> 00:09.313
And then, there was this...

00:09.959 --> 00:10.265
Gronk!

00:13.718 --> 00:14.563
Gronk spike!

00:16.328 --> 00:17.591
From the spike, it evolved quickly.

00:18.441 --> 00:19.161
We got the shimmy.

00:19.453 --> 00:20.181
We got the shake.

00:20.590 --> 00:21.834
And the shimmy shimmy shake.

00:22.337 --> 00:23.093
Then there was T.O.,...

00:23.295 --> 00:24.296
...who took it to the next level.

00:26.645 --> 00:27.971
That guy's got unlimited moves.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.315
And today everyone wants things unlimited.

00:33.626 --> 00:34.355
Nice moves, kid.

00:34.845 --> 00:35.767
I'm not done yet.

00:37.039 --> 00:38.569
Say "goodbye" to limits.

00:38.985 --> 00:39.949
Unlimited moves.

00:40.941 --> 00:43.489
This guy's got the shimmidy sham sham shimmidy shake right there.
