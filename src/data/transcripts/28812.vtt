ï»¿I'm not sure the right man for you has been born yet.

00:17.290 --> 00:18.063
I'm not afraid.

00:20.299 --> 00:21.641
For the first time in my life,...

00:23.430 --> 00:24.250
...I know who I am.

00:25.506 --> 00:27.703
My heart belongs to no one but the desert.

00:33.084 --> 00:35.075
What is it then, that attracts you?

00:37.822 --> 00:38.545
It's their freedom.

00:42.721 --> 00:44.610
It's their poetry of life.
