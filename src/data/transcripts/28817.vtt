Little town,...

00:05.759 --> 00:08.513
...it's a quiet village.

00:09.163 --> 00:14.001
Every day like the one before.

00:14.469 --> 00:16.112
Little town,...

00:16.461 --> 00:19.239
...full of little people...

00:19.801 --> 00:25.335
...waking up to say...

00:25.541 --> 00:25.903
Bonjour!

00:29.823 --> 00:33.318
There goes the baker with his tray like always,...

00:33.636 --> 00:36.247
...the same old bread and rolls to sell.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.653
Every morning just the same...

00:38.945 --> 00:40.627
...since the morning that we came...

00:40.839 --> 00:42.405
...to this poor, provincial town.

00:42.545 --> 00:43.396
Good morning, Belle!

00:45.456 --> 00:46.833
Somebody help me!
