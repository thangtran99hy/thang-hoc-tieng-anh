00:03.066 --> 00:05.056
Well, I guess family is very important to me.

00:06.929 --> 00:08.739
My husband and my son,...

00:10.031 --> 00:11.841
...my parents who are back in Adelaide...

00:12.048 --> 00:14.040
...so, sort of spending time with them when I get a chance...

00:14.167 --> 00:15.213
...is really important to me.

00:15.731 --> 00:16.767
Probably my family then.

00:18.068 --> 00:23.453
Love their smile, love their laugh, laughter and their company.

00:24.312 --> 00:26.847
Three things, that'd be my husband and two children.

00:27.811 --> 00:28.779
Couldn't leave them behind.

00:29.397 --> 00:32.023
Probably sneak in some chocolate somewhere as well.

00:33.165 --> 00:36.654
I love my children, my husband and my parents.

00:37.539 --> 00:39.868
Well, I can't deny I love my husband.

00:40.689 --> 00:43.251
We're in year 49 of marriage.

00:44.976 --> 00:47.965
So, and the rest of the family, particularly the grandchildren,...

00:48.371 --> 00:49.494
...and I love Australia.
