One of the most important principles for choosing a lover sensibly...

00:05.909 --> 00:09.399
...is not to feel in any hurry to make a choice.

00:09.991 --> 00:15.703
Being satisfied with being single is a precondition of satisfactory coupledom.

00:16.446 --> 00:20.751
We cannot choose wisely when remaining single feels unbearable.

00:21.275 --> 00:25.598
We have to be utterly at peace with the prospect of many years of solitude...

00:25.945 --> 00:29.707
...in order to have any chance of forming a good relationship...

00:30.251 --> 00:32.785
...or we'll love no longer being single...

00:33.131 --> 00:37.267
...rather more than we love the partner who spared us being so.

00:38.206 --> 00:44.348
Unfortunately, after a certain age, society makes singlehood feel dangerously unpleasant.

00:44.895 --> 00:46.851
Communal life starts to wither.

00:47.341 --> 00:50.831
People in couples are too threatened by the independence of the single...

00:51.184 --> 00:52.751
...to invite them around very often...

00:53.061 --> 00:55.877
...in case they are reminded of something they might have missed.

00:56.555 --> 01:01.961
Friendship and sex are, despite all the gadgets, still remarkably hard to come by.

01:02.569 --> 01:07.107
No wonder if when someone slightly decent, but not quite so, comes along,...

01:07.338 --> 01:11.327
...we cling to them, to our eventual enormous cost.
