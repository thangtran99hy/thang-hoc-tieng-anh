00:00.009 --> 00:02.353
Oh, you actually bought that car online yesterday.

00:02.611 --> 00:02.930
Yeah.

00:03.544 --> 00:04.473
You really that lazy?

00:04.793 --> 00:05.385
Lazy?

00:07.555 --> 00:09.240
Lazy as in the mother of invention?

00:09.477 --> 00:11.999
Maybe I should go to the grocery store like a normal person..

00:12.263 --> 00:14.103
...but I choose delivery for my kumquats.

00:14.559 --> 00:16.777
And I choose to have a robot vacuum my floor.

00:16.983 --> 00:17.793
Who else is gonna do that?

00:17.932 --> 00:18.210
You?

00:18.678 --> 00:19.041
Me?

00:19.358 --> 00:21.425
I choose to ride the escalator going down...

00:21.574 --> 00:23.191
...and to stream movies I own on DVD.

00:23.347 --> 00:25.781
And to let social media remember birthdays for me.

00:25.874 --> 00:28.427
I choose to wear the internet on my face.

00:29.370 --> 00:29.921
It's open.

00:31.214 --> 00:31.782
Hey, your car is here.

00:31.944 --> 00:32.454
Nice.

00:32.719 --> 00:34.739
So, I say to you what everyone knows.

00:34.912 --> 00:37.523
Where there's a will, there's always a way to make it easier.

00:37.649 --> 00:41.094
So you can judge me for choosing to date people by computational algorithm,...

00:41.230 --> 00:43.321
...but you'll never get me to ask for a date in person...

00:43.567 --> 00:46.906
...like some sort of animal or do anything else the old way.

00:47.414 --> 00:47.596
Doug.

00:48.139 --> 00:50.719
And yes, I choose to buy a Carvana car from my couch...

00:50.813 --> 00:53.635
...and have it delivered to my front door with a seven-day test own.
