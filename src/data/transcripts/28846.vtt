WEBVTT

00:00.433 --> 00:08.180
Between our first breath and our last, our lives are shaped by how we move,...

00:10.252 --> 00:11.535
...by how hard we push.

00:12.709 --> 00:17.303
Flip, fly and hang.

00:18.825 --> 00:21.553
Our stories are written on our calluses and scars...

00:25.863 --> 00:31.447
...through our battles and mistakes.

00:33.559 --> 00:36.667
But as our bodies change, so do we.

00:41.727 --> 00:47.498
We become braver, kinder, closer.

00:51.549 --> 00:56.515
We become more human.
