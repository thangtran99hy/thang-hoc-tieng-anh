It is an important question you ask, but one, I think, with a simple answer.

00:09.194 --> 00:10.878
We have this need, you and I,...

00:11.369 --> 00:15.522
...from the time we were little, to peek over our neighbor's fence.

00:15.810 --> 00:19.537
And once we do, we see there is wonder waiting on the other side.

00:20.273 --> 00:24.124
Every step you take brings the world one step closer.

00:26.261 --> 00:28.997
You'll narrowly influence some narrow minds.

00:31.504 --> 00:39.422
You'll bridge continents, puncture prejudice and keep peace.

00:39.890 --> 00:42.224
You may not always know it at the time,...

00:42.522 --> 00:47.611
...but one day you will look back and see that you have made this world a better place.

00:48.052 --> 00:51.903
So, the question you asked me, "What is the key?"

00:54.903 --> 00:56.078
It's you.
