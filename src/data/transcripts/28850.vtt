00:00.270 --> 00:03.409
The paints are mixed with fluid from animals' gallbladders...

00:03.732 --> 00:05.787
...in order not to break up in the water.

00:06.425 --> 00:12.061
Then, they wait to be turned into tulips, roses and carnations...

00:12.139 --> 00:13.620
...at the artisan's hands.

00:14.671 --> 00:18.151
Gum is harvested from the tragacanth plant,...

00:18.577 --> 00:21.747
...which is collected from the mountains of Anatolia.

00:22.859 --> 00:26.519
This gum is used to give the liquid its consistency...

00:26.793 --> 00:29.341
...and make it possible to carry paint around.

00:29.884 --> 00:34.540
The Ebru artist takes up a brush made from rose branches and horse hair...

00:34.976 --> 00:36.128
...and goes to the tray.

00:37.023 --> 00:42.979
After a while, maybe a Gelgit style will begin, maybe a Bulbul Yuvasi style,...

00:43.409 --> 00:46.880
...maybe a Sal shape, maybe a combed shape,...

00:47.114 --> 00:52.235
...maybe a Hatip style floral design, maybe a floral shape.

00:52.852 --> 00:57.508
The comb and the hand of the artist gracefully thins the paint with oil...

00:57.795 --> 00:59.735
...and imprints a picture on the page,...

00:59.873 --> 01:03.538
...leaving a sense of inner joy not visible to the naked eye.

01:04.578 --> 01:10.286
Once an Ebru artist feels that joy, she never leaves her tray again.

01:10.561 --> 01:15.527
She spends her years watching the magical dance of the colors in the water.
