From the people that brought you Google Home...

00:02.592 --> 00:04.838
...comes the next evolution of the smart home...

00:05.278 --> 00:06.947
...and it's just outside your window.

00:07.373 --> 00:08.737
Meet Google Gnome.

00:09.544 --> 00:10.895
Hi, how can I help?

00:11.580 --> 00:13.339
Okay Gnome, what's the weather like outside?

00:13.591 --> 00:16.536
The weather outside is sunny and 76 degrees.

00:17.371 --> 00:17.877
He's right.

00:18.751 --> 00:21.027
Okay Gnome, turn on the hose I'm holding.

00:21.104 --> 00:21.478
Sure.

00:22.979 --> 00:24.381
Okay Gnome, can I eat this lemon tree leaf?

00:24.690 --> 00:25.018
Yes.

00:25.333 --> 00:25.897
What about this daisy?

00:26.195 --> 00:27.607
Yes, but I wouldn't recommend it.

00:27.849 --> 00:28.716
Okay, but I could eat it.

00:29.144 --> 00:31.579
Okay Gnome, add milk to my shopping list.

00:31.860 --> 00:34.145
I'm sorry, that sounds like an indoor request.

00:35.149 --> 00:36.062
I keep doing that, sorry.

00:36.209 --> 00:37.301
You do keep doing that.
