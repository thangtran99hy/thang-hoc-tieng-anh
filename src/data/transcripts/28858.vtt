I've seen some foray into, for example, artificial intelligence...

00:04.662 --> 00:08.081
...actually, for example, writing music or poetry.

00:09.161 --> 00:11.785
But I think there's still a long way to go in that space.

00:11.879 --> 00:17.805
But if it's other things that's more routine based, for example,...

00:18.055 --> 00:19.727
...that's obviously here and now.

00:20.031 --> 00:23.092
It depends on which kind of area we're talking about.

00:23.325 --> 00:27.145
Hopefully though, AI won't be replacing management anytime soon.

00:28.769 --> 00:29.529
We'll see about that.

00:29.625 --> 00:30.433
It wouldn't be so good for you.

00:30.705 --> 00:33.045
The other big question is, is it time to panic?

00:33.777 --> 00:37.195
Will AI, will the robopocalypse come?

00:37.423 --> 00:39.919
We're always gonna be around to manage that process...

00:40.046 --> 00:43.595
...and so, I don't see the doomsday scenario anytime soon.
