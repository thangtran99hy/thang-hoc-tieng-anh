My experience here, volunteering in Selamta in Ethiopia,...

00:04.297 --> 00:06.167
...has changed the way I travel.

00:06.978 --> 00:09.329
There is something that happens when you make a connection...

00:09.423 --> 00:12.379
...and you help somebody that actually helps you...

00:12.581 --> 00:14.694
...build your own sense of self.

00:16.023 --> 00:21.370
Selamta creates forever families by uniting orphaned and abandoned children...

00:21.583 --> 00:24.415
...with marginalized women to create new permanent families.

00:25.636 --> 00:26.978
These folks have been through so much...

00:27.217 --> 00:30.039
...and to see them come out on the other side of it changes you.

00:30.140 --> 00:31.577
You can't help but be affected by it,...

00:31.851 --> 00:34.454
...and so every time I come over, I'm constantly inspired.

00:34.799 --> 00:37.253
It's just a beautiful thing to be a part of once you come over.

00:37.859 --> 00:38.314
It's different.

00:38.585 --> 00:39.695
Your life is different afterwards.

00:40.823 --> 00:44.471
These kids and the moms are so resilient.

00:44.755 --> 00:50.111
They have found a way to trust and  love in spite of it all.

00:50.413 --> 00:57.455
I think I came to Selamta thinking that I would help the  families and help the kids...

00:57.809 --> 01:00.981
...and what has really changed is that they have helped me.
