ï»¿North Korea is an unimaginable country.

00:04.533 --> 00:06.416
There is only one channel on TV.

00:07.513 --> 00:08.871
There is also no internet.

00:10.039 --> 00:16.008
We aren't free to sing, say, wear or think what we want.

00:18.229 --> 00:22.721
North Korea is the only country in the world that executed people...

00:23.120 --> 00:25.757
...for making unauthorized international phone calls.

00:27.420 --> 00:29.832
North Koreans are being terrorized today.

00:31.032 --> 00:33.327
The day I escaped North Korea,...

00:35.065 --> 00:40.620
...we walked across the Gobi Desert, following a compass...

00:41.667 --> 00:46.377
...and when that stopped working, we followed the stars to freedom.

00:47.885 --> 00:51.003
People often ask me, "How can we help North Koreans?"

00:51.947 --> 00:53.056
There are many ways.

00:53.987 --> 01:01.673
One, as you care for yourself, so you can raise awareness about human crisis in North Korea.

01:02.786 --> 01:09.022
Two, help and support North Korean refugees who are trying to escape to freedom.

01:10.083 --> 01:14.107
Three, petition China to stop repatriation.

01:14.655 --> 01:17.869
We have to shed the light on the darkest place in the world.

01:18.809 --> 01:25.446
Fellow delegates, please join me as we make this a global movement to free North Koreans.
