00:02.811 --> 00:04.961
I'm Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Alan Arkin.

00:05.058 --> 00:07.852
We're here to play this game.

00:07.995 --> 00:08.860
Never have I ever.

00:08.939 --> 00:09.743
Never have I ever.

00:09.873 --> 00:11.925
They say that we're going to have fun.

00:12.024 --> 00:13.471
I doubt that very seriously.

00:13.567 --> 00:14.547
But here we go, okay?

00:14.644 --> 00:15.112
Here we go.

00:15.223 --> 00:16.635
Have you ever shoplifted?

00:16.788 --> 00:17.147
No.

00:18.189 --> 00:19.149
I take the fifth.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.854
Have you ever wished you had a different voice?

00:23.013 --> 00:23.593
Not I.

00:23.874 --> 00:24.350
Nope.

00:24.953 --> 00:27.616
Have you ever been confused for another actor?

00:31.043 --> 00:36.827
I was in an airport in Dallas and this guy comes over to me.

00:36.936 --> 00:38.640
I'm slouched down in the seat and he says,...

00:38.749 --> 00:42.031
"You're trying to be incognito, but I recognize you."

00:43.069 --> 00:43.577
So, "Oh yeah?"

00:43.669 --> 00:45.956
And he said, "Yeah, you know, Samuel L. Jackson."

00:46.057 --> 00:47.017
"You can't deny it."

00:47.098 --> 00:49.750
I said, "I'm not Sam Jackson."

00:50.095 --> 00:51.695
He said, "You're lying but it's okay."

00:53.170 --> 00:56.173
Have you ever had a job you loved as much as acting?

00:57.850 --> 00:59.519
I'd loved it so much, I'd do it for nothing.

00:59.613 --> 01:01.576
But I don't tell producers that.

01:01.724 --> 01:05.900
I've worked for years with no money just to get on stage.

01:05.987 --> 01:09.738
For the first 30 years of my life, 40 years up, it was act or die.

01:10.269 --> 01:14.341
But then, I discovered directing and writing and teaching...

01:14.457 --> 01:17.339
...and I found a lot of joy in all of those.

01:17.428 --> 01:20.001
I never wanted to direct because I like to go home early.
