00:03.803 --> 00:07.035
One day, a man was walking along the beach...

00:07.545 --> 00:12.325
...when he noticed a boy picking up starfish and throwing them into the ocean.

00:15.233 --> 00:20.102
Approaching the boy he asked, "Excuse me, but what are you doing?"

00:21.133 --> 00:25.015
The boy replied, "Throwing starfish back into the ocean."

00:25.489 --> 00:27.977
"The sun is rising and the tide is going out."

00:28.361 --> 00:31.035
"If I don't throw them back, they'll die."

00:32.721 --> 00:34.929
The man laughed to himself and said,...

00:35.501 --> 00:38.071
"But there's too many starfish on this beach."

00:38.230 --> 00:40.462
"You can't possibly make a difference."

00:41.825 --> 00:44.813
After listening politely, the boy bent down,...

00:45.055 --> 00:48.783
...picked up another starfish and threw it into the ocean.

00:49.429 --> 00:51.795
Then, turning to the man, he said, ...

00:52.352 --> 00:54.513
"I made a difference to that one."
