My name is Tim Bengel.

00:06.286 --> 00:09.553
Since I was a little boy, I was curious about art.

00:10.164 --> 00:14.108
I didn't understand it because I couldn't find its rules.

00:15.127 --> 00:18.803
But for art, there are no rules like there are for math or grammar.

00:19.533 --> 00:24.941
It's a field without conventions and that's what makes it so exciting for me.

00:26.179 --> 00:30.474
For me, art means to do things different.

00:32.618 --> 00:36.058
So, while everyone made sculptures or oil paintings,...

00:36.445 --> 00:41.097
...I wanted to make things differently and so, I invented my own technique...

00:41.463 --> 00:45.198
...with remarkable materials and a unique recognition value.

00:46.747 --> 00:49.393
Of course, the beginnings weren't easy.

00:50.448 --> 00:52.654
A lot of people didn't take my idea seriously,...

00:53.249 --> 00:54.120
...ignored me or said,...

00:54.760 --> 00:58.447
"Tim, you're just a normal guy from a little town in Germany."

00:59.497 --> 01:00.826
"You can't become an artist."

01:01.733 --> 01:03.541
"Do better, something decent."

01:03.959 --> 01:06.831
My advice to all dreamers out there is...

01:07.733 --> 01:10.503
...follow your vision and if you have a dream,...

01:12.766 --> 01:13.965
...dream it big.
