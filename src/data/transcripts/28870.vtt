ï»¿Whatever's in there...

00:04.849 --> 00:06.776
...has been safely hidden for two thousand years.

00:10.791 --> 00:11.617
This isn't a tomb.

00:12.298 --> 00:12.894
It's a prison.

00:13.575 --> 00:13.727
Nick!

00:18.181 --> 00:20.383
The hieroglyphs said she was named Ahmanet,...

00:21.525 --> 00:23.587
...chosen to be Egypt's next Queen.

00:24.886 --> 00:28.507
But her thirst for power led her down a darker path,...

00:29.277 --> 00:31.256
...one that had to be stopped.

00:35.247 --> 00:36.656
Because of your actions,...

00:37.436 --> 00:38.743
...this ancient power...

00:40.924 --> 00:41.673
...has returned.

00:56.171 --> 00:58.601
You are alive because you were chosen.

00:59.299 --> 00:59.759
Chosen?

01:00.376 --> 01:00.818
By what?

01:01.951 --> 01:02.165
Evil.
