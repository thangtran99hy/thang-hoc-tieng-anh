Okay, hi.

00:01.963 --> 00:04.989
So, yesterday I was chatting on Skype with a friend from New York.

00:05.170 --> 00:07.437
And I know there's a lot of differences in...

00:07.580 --> 00:09.201
Every country has their own language...

00:09.376 --> 00:12.435
...and even like, English-speaking languages have their own takes...

00:12.564 --> 00:14.423
...on particular words and phrases.

00:14.596 --> 00:15.920
When it comes to cars,...

00:16.464 --> 00:17.801
...you pop the hood.

00:18.452 --> 00:19.051
We don't call it a hood.

00:19.140 --> 00:20.019
We call it a bonnet.

00:21.036 --> 00:23.783
And we don't pop the trunk at the back.

00:24.095 --> 00:24.919
We don't call it a trunk.

00:25.095 --> 00:26.030
We call it a boot.

00:26.280 --> 00:27.596
You go to the gas station.

00:27.751 --> 00:30.171
We go to the service station, which is odd...

00:30.273 --> 00:33.413
...because people don't really get their cars serviced there anymore anyway.

00:33.521 --> 00:34.714
You go to the grocery store.

00:34.788 --> 00:36.024
We go to the supermarket.

00:36.221 --> 00:39.170
You walk down the sidewalk, we walk down the footpath.

00:39.490 --> 00:41.951
You park in a parking lot, we park in a car park.

00:42.119 --> 00:44.379
You wear a sweater, we call it a jumper.

00:44.583 --> 00:46.523
You call it a soda, we call it soft drink.

00:46.634 --> 00:49.420
Oh, and then there's shopping cart, which we call a trolley.

00:50.231 --> 00:51.129
Oh, there are so many!

00:51.391 --> 00:54.623
Oh, and what you call a cookie, we call a biscuit.

00:55.145 --> 00:56.635
And that's even more confusing...

00:56.696 --> 01:00.621
...because what you call a biscuit is what we call a scone,...

01:00.777 --> 01:02.230
...except we don't pronounce it "scone".

01:02.373 --> 01:04.012
We pronounce it "scone".
