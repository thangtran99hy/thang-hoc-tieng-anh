00:00.343 --> 00:01.184
You're really kind to say so.

00:01.245 --> 00:03.921
I mean, Harry, Catherine and I really felt this was such an important area...

00:03.993 --> 00:09.082
...that throughout all our charitable work, whether it's veterans, homelessness, addiction,...

00:10.155 --> 00:12.979
...most of it seemed to stem back to mental health issues.

00:13.041 --> 00:15.886
And you know, I read your open letter you wrote the other day...

00:15.948 --> 00:17.124
...and I thought it was incredibly moving...

00:17.195 --> 00:22.135
...and very brave of you to write down such personal feelings.

00:22.199 --> 00:27.897
And I wanted to ask you very much what you, how you found speaking out and how it made you feel.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.852
It made me very nervous at first.

00:31.481 --> 00:34.159
For me, waking up every day and feeling sad...

00:34.281 --> 00:39.446
...and going on stage is something that is very hard to describe.

00:39.553 --> 00:42.064
There's a lot of shame attached to mental illness.

00:42.129 --> 00:44.134
You feel like something's wrong with you...

00:44.628 --> 00:47.109
...and in my life I go, "Oh my goodness,..."

00:47.191 --> 00:51.435
"...look at all these beautiful, wonderful things that I have and I should be so happy..."

00:51.772 --> 00:54.338
...but you can't help it if in the morning when you wake up,...

00:54.795 --> 00:57.270
...you are so tired, you are so sad.

00:57.581 --> 01:02.176
You are so full of anxiety and the shakes that you can barely think...

01:02.283 --> 01:07.129
...but it was like saying, "This is a part of me and that's okay."

01:07.503 --> 01:10.987
It's interesting to see and hear from you how much having that conversation...

01:11.076 --> 01:14.999
...or having that sort of ability to speak to someone really made a difference to you.

01:15.090 --> 01:18.857
I think, for me, the little bits that I've learned so far about mental health...

01:19.013 --> 01:21.858
...is very much the case of, you know, it's okay to have this conversation.

01:21.919 --> 01:26.065
It's really important to have this conversation and that you won't be judged.

01:26.147 --> 01:29.577
It's so important to break open that fear and that taboo,...

01:29.644 --> 01:32.635
...which is only gonna lead to more problems down the line.
