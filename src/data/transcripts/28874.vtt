ï»¿Amazon is a retailer.

00:02.298 --> 00:03.759
We're a transportation company,...

00:04.433 --> 00:06.129
...so what that means is...

00:06.525 --> 00:12.195
...we have a tremendous amount of upstream hubs, sortation facilities,...

00:13.259 --> 00:15.725
...flights, trucking routes and so forth.

00:16.337 --> 00:21.098
Amazon is about you coming to their store through mobile mostly.

00:21.442 --> 00:23.579
And then, rather than you're coming to...

00:23.995 --> 00:27.187
...their location like Penny's or Target or Walmart,...

00:27.513 --> 00:28.573
They deliver it to you.
