Hey 18-year-old Michelle, this is Michelle from the future...

00:06.077 --> 00:10.825
...and I have some things I would like you to know.

00:11.025 --> 00:14.194
You are stronger than you think you are,...

00:14.372 --> 00:17.169
...you're wiser than you give yourself credit for...

00:17.595 --> 00:21.657
...and your first instinct is usually always correct.

00:22.093 --> 00:26.990
You're gonna start a relationship in your late teens and early twenties...

00:27.125 --> 00:30.733
...and you're gonna have a beautiful daughter to show for it.

00:30.981 --> 00:33.239
The person you are at the beginning of the relationship...

00:33.447 --> 00:37.670
...isn't going to be the same person you are when you enter your thirties.

00:37.877 --> 00:41.143
And that's okay because people grow and people change...

00:41.283 --> 00:43.555
...and you're gonna learn a lot about yourself.

00:43.706 --> 00:45.491
And the thing that is going to get you through that...

00:45.625 --> 00:49.941
...is you're gonna have a feeling deep down in the pit of your stomach...

00:50.190 --> 00:53.917
...that everything happens for a reason and everything's gonna be okay.
