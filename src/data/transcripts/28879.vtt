00:01.174 --> 00:01.937
That's really hard.

00:02.032 --> 00:02.572
What does "love" mean?

00:02.761 --> 00:04.461
Love is...

00:08.138 --> 00:09.029
...complicated.

00:09.711 --> 00:11.186
It means work.

00:11.613 --> 00:14.451
But it means consistency.

00:14.878 --> 00:17.015
I think love is true empathy.

00:17.257 --> 00:21.387
Something which can really only be appreciated after the passage of time.

00:21.465 --> 00:25.741
Love is extraordinary and love is magnetic.

00:25.910 --> 00:29.877
Love is gross and awesome.

00:31.503 --> 00:32.313
I was really nervous.

00:32.523 --> 00:35.023
I knew I loved her but I needed to tell her.

00:35.147 --> 00:36.786
I think I said it first, actually.

00:36.881 --> 00:39.364
I think he couldn't understand me because I was talking in Spanish.

00:39.433 --> 00:40.168
He was like, "What!?"

00:45.612 --> 00:48.021
Love is a blossoming thing in my heart.

00:48.422 --> 00:49.117
I love love.

00:49.494 --> 00:51.495
Love means letting your kid do all the talking.

00:53.947 --> 00:54.625
Thank you.

00:54.863 --> 00:55.399
You're welcome.
