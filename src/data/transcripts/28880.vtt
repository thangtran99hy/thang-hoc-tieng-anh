00:00.461 --> 00:01.571
It's weird, right?

00:02.539 --> 00:04.207
The humans' obsession with our poop?

00:04.864 --> 00:08.152
I mean, just look at the lengths they've gone to harvest this stuff.

00:10.003 --> 00:13.973
Have you ever noticed how excited they get when the dog goes number two?

00:14.369 --> 00:15.343
What a good boy.

00:15.659 --> 00:16.419
That's my baby.

00:19.611 --> 00:24.332
All we know for certain is that our feces must be very valuable.

00:24.620 --> 00:26.723
Why else would they have invented this?

00:27.302 --> 00:29.989
This crazy, high-tech poop-harvesting machine.

00:30.979 --> 00:31.888
Look at this thing.

00:32.122 --> 00:35.435
I don't even remember what my poo smells like anymore.

00:35.813 --> 00:38.189
It's like a part of me doesn't exist.

00:39.027 --> 00:42.796
Every few weeks a fresh tray of crystals automatically shows up...

00:42.914 --> 00:44.187
...to keep the whole system running.

00:44.722 --> 00:47.646
They've built an entire infrastructure to whisk our poo off...

00:47.998 --> 00:51.115
...to an undisclosed location in an armored tank.

00:53.921 --> 00:56.445
But have you ever stopped to ask yourself why.

00:57.044 --> 00:58.470
Open your eyes, people.

00:58.851 --> 01:00.079
They're using us for our poo.
