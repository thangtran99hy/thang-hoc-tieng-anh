ï»¿I had my first challenge when I tried out for the cheerleading squad...

00:04.267 --> 00:05.768
...and they told me I was too big.

00:06.769 --> 00:09.905
Even though I have now signed with an agency...

00:10.015 --> 00:13.837
...that's considered one of New York's top ten modeling agencies,...

00:13.928 --> 00:15.678
...my parents still think I'm too fat.

00:16.471 --> 00:18.301
My body shape is curvy.

00:19.153 --> 00:24.765
It's so hard to compare yourself to someone six foot tall and a size two.

00:25.027 --> 00:28.317
We look at the magazines, we look at TV...

00:28.727 --> 00:32.361
...and it's just a whole bunch of non-reality.

00:32.601 --> 00:36.349
It's ingrained in our heads that if we lose weight, then we're beautiful.

00:36.882 --> 00:39.375
It's really strange, there are some people who get really mad and they're like,...

00:39.721 --> 00:41.476
..."You're not a plus-size model; you're a model."

00:41.850 --> 00:43.700
But what they don't see personally, for me,...

00:44.194 --> 00:46.747
...is that I love being called a plus-size model.

00:46.923 --> 00:48.188
I think the term "plus model",...

00:48.725 --> 00:49.965
....I don't want to take it away.

00:50.382 --> 00:51.614
I think that it's empowering.

00:51.841 --> 00:52.546
It's what I am.

00:52.901 --> 00:54.827
I'm happy knowing that when I was growing up,...

00:54.931 --> 00:56.377
...I couldn't find clothes in my size.

00:56.463 --> 00:59.803
And now, because myself and other friends who are my size are working,...

01:00.339 --> 01:01.997
...there are more options for us now.

01:02.883 --> 01:04.516
It's not about being a certain size...

01:04.660 --> 01:07.064
...but it's just about loving your body no matter what it is...

01:07.854 --> 01:08.865
...and where you are.
