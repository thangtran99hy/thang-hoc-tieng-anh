Austin.

00:02.651 --> 00:04.415
It's good to be home, honestly.

00:07.081 --> 00:08.393
I don't come here enough.

00:09.023 --> 00:10.437
I'm back in my hometown...

00:10.780 --> 00:13.193
...and I've got these three new friends from the city...

00:13.299 --> 00:14.819
...who've never been out into the wilderness.

00:15.119 --> 00:16.518
I wanna introduce them to nature...

00:16.658 --> 00:19.487
...because it's been such an important part of my life.

00:21.419 --> 00:24.567
Being in nature, how's it make you feel?

00:24.773 --> 00:26.397
It makes me feel adventurous.

00:26.558 --> 00:27.685
Let's go explore.

00:31.682 --> 00:33.637
Yeah, nice!

00:33.819 --> 00:34.459
Free.

00:35.195 --> 00:36.183
Free.

00:36.929 --> 00:39.073
That is the definition of freedom right there, right?

00:39.493 --> 00:40.280
Calm.

00:40.831 --> 00:41.523
Calm.

00:42.107 --> 00:42.785
Do you hear that?

00:44.586 --> 00:48.823
Somehow, we overlook nature's perfection all the time and we trash it.

00:49.131 --> 00:51.012
You're telling me it makes you happy.

00:51.107 --> 00:53.100
It makes you feel peaceful and calm.

00:53.765 --> 00:55.359
That's something worth protecting.

00:55.846 --> 01:00.495
These bottles are important because these will not go in the landfill like the boxes.

01:01.653 --> 01:03.121
This is our birthright.

01:03.523 --> 01:05.571
It is your birthright to feel calm and peace.

01:05.694 --> 01:07.966
It is your birthright to feel happy and free.

01:08.226 --> 01:11.458
And that's up to your generation and my generation...

01:12.436 --> 01:13.996
...to leave nothing but footprints.
