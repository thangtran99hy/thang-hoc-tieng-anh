00:00.456 --> 00:02.260
ï»¿With this being the world's smallest radio,...

00:02.341 --> 00:04.076
...it had to have a sales pitch to match.

00:04.315 --> 00:05.229
And here it was.

00:05.770 --> 00:07.510
A radio that could fit in your pocket.

00:08.027 --> 00:09.166
There's only one problem though.

00:09.316 --> 00:11.277
It didn't fit in the average-sized pocket.

00:11.969 --> 00:13.755
The solution was a little bit sneaky.

00:14.701 --> 00:17.529
Sony made people from their sales team wear bigger pockets...

00:17.611 --> 00:19.643
...that were custom-made to fit the radios...

00:19.990 --> 00:21.262
...but at least they could fit now.

00:22.617 --> 00:25.632
From then on, orders for the new device came flooding in.

00:25.930 --> 00:28.922
The Americans loved the Sony TR-63.

00:29.114 --> 00:31.386
And it was widely popular with teenagers.

00:32.013 --> 00:36.447
Some music historians state that the 1957 Sony TR-63...

00:36.531 --> 00:39.077
...was instrumental in the rise of rock and roll music...

00:39.161 --> 00:41.877
...because it allowed kids to independently listen to their music...

00:42.008 --> 00:44.434
...finally freed from the tyranny of their parents.
