Medical laboratory technicians are vital to help physicians or clinicians...

00:06.459 --> 00:09.181
...determine what exactly is going wrong with the patient.

00:13.566 --> 00:17.560
We go through all of the specimens: the blood, the urine and whatnot...

00:17.977 --> 00:21.097
...to help the doctor come up with a diagnosis.

00:21.451 --> 00:23.634
The lab part of it is the best ever.

00:23.981 --> 00:28.755
We have the opportunity to diagnose and view different parasites under the microscope.

00:29.088 --> 00:31.430
I love getting in there and being able to draw blood...

00:31.785 --> 00:35.168
...and looking at all of the different bacteria under the microscope.
