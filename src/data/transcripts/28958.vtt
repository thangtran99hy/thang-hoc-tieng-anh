00:00.755 --> 00:02.129
You have beautiful hands.

00:03.042 --> 00:06.962
You are quite unused to physical labor, no?

00:08.961 --> 00:10.127
War changes everything.

00:12.789 --> 00:15.563
The Kaiser remains of great symbolic importance to the German people.

00:15.839 --> 00:18.290
You'll address him as "Sir" and you will speak only when spoken to...

00:18.374 --> 00:20.304
...and all discussion of politics is forbidden.

00:20.542 --> 00:23.057
You are to take immediate command of his military guard.

00:23.171 --> 00:25.660
British Secret Service have an agent in the area.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.337
Could be a kidnap attempt, most likely an assassination.

00:28.468 --> 00:32.171
If anything happens to him, Captain, you'll be shot.

00:35.431 --> 00:38.295
Captain, there's a British spy after me.

00:38.414 --> 00:39.741
You'll be quite safe, Your Highness

00:41.690 --> 00:44.670
My name is Stefan, I was wondering what yours was.

00:44.952 --> 00:45.654
Mieke de Jong.

00:51.085 --> 00:52.896
Be careful, nobody is safe.

00:54.994 --> 00:58.938
Can an officer have a loyalty to anything greater than his country?

01:00.927 --> 01:03.231
Marry me, Mieke, now, today.

01:07.159 --> 01:09.315
He was going to turn you over to the Gestapo.

01:13.314 --> 01:14.874
Mieke, trust me!
