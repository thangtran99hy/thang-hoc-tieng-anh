00:00.281 --> 00:02.539
Some people are so full of life and and energy,...

00:02.635 --> 00:05.686
...but for some reason, even when you seem to get more than enough sleep,...

00:05.807 --> 00:08.681
...you're still fighting off yawns and fatigue through the day.

00:08.921 --> 00:11.366
If you know the number of hours of sleep isn't the problem,...

00:11.463 --> 00:13.333
...the second most common cause of fatigue...

00:13.457 --> 00:16.008
...comes from lack of physical activity and a poor diet.

00:16.308 --> 00:20.314
Study after study finds that adults who began light exercise a few times a week...

00:20.441 --> 00:22.619
...reported more energy after six weeks.

00:22.855 --> 00:25.805
People who exercise more regularly also report sleeping better...

00:25.926 --> 00:28.753
...even though studies show that they aren't sleeping any longer.

00:28.899 --> 00:31.153
While many studies show coffee is good for your health,...

00:31.249 --> 00:34.450
...research shows that your reliance on it can make you more sleepy.

00:34.719 --> 00:38.457
Caffeine blocks adenosine in your brain, which normally accumulates through the day...

00:38.528 --> 00:40.019
...and makes you sleepy at night,...

00:40.285 --> 00:43.733
...but consuming coffee or energy drinks less than six hours before bed...

00:43.947 --> 00:45.833
...can ultimately affect your sleep quality.

00:46.049 --> 00:48.156
As a result, people who don't use caffeine...

00:48.298 --> 00:50.344
...often report feeling less tired in the morning.

00:50.474 --> 00:52.271
Your mental well-being plays a role, too.

00:52.389 --> 00:53.603
Anxiety is a big one.

00:53.763 --> 00:56.300
Worrying what people think, always feeling tense about work...

00:56.384 --> 01:00.854
...or being overly concerned about every decision can be physically exhausting...

01:01.005 --> 01:04.794
...and fatigue is one of the main symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder.

01:04.952 --> 01:07.627
Not only that, but anxiety may be affecting your sleep quality.

01:07.754 --> 01:11.965
On another serious end, depression can cause both physical and emotional fatigue,...

01:12.147 --> 01:14.698
...which more sleep won't necessarily relieve.
