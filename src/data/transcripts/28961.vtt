ï»¿Hi, Alanna.

00:00.784 --> 00:01.377
Hi, Doug, how are you?

00:01.595 --> 00:02.975
I'm Doug Speirs from Free Press.

00:03.049 --> 00:04.034
Hi, nice to see you.

00:04.201 --> 00:05.845
As you know, I'm a Type 2 diabetic.

00:05.992 --> 00:09.681
What I eat really has a big impact on my Type 2 diabetes.

00:10.247 --> 00:12.801
It's important to know how to eat sensibly.

00:12.956 --> 00:16.923
I thought we could go through some tips on healthy eating...

00:17.001 --> 00:18.645
...and how to better control your blood sugar levels.

00:18.716 --> 00:19.717
I could use a few tips.

00:19.815 --> 00:20.059
Okay.

00:20.441 --> 00:24.662
So this is put out by the Canadian Diabetes Association.

00:24.774 --> 00:25.086
Okay.

00:25.405 --> 00:29.381
So, the first tip is to eat three meals a day at regular times...

00:29.473 --> 00:31.870
...and space your meals no more than six hours apart.

00:32.161 --> 00:35.613
So, the second point says limit sugars and sweets.

00:35.710 --> 00:39.331
Sweets in moderation can be acceptable.
