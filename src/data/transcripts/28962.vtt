Basic day as a dietitian would be coming in to work...

00:04.057 --> 00:08.892
...and picking up on referrals that come through from the wards and then assessing patients.

00:09.847 --> 00:14.035
You liaise with many health professionals in the way of nursing staff and doctors,...

00:14.174 --> 00:17.887
...but also other healthcare professionals to do with therapies,...

00:17.973 --> 00:19.465
...so like physio, for example.

00:20.179 --> 00:22.863
For me, the job satisfaction plays a big part...

00:23.102 --> 00:27.534
...and for dietitians and other professions within the NHS,...

00:27.747 --> 00:32.260
...that job satisfaction probably comes from the rapport you get with seeing patients...

00:32.441 --> 00:35.805
...from when they're first referred and following them through their patient journey.

00:36.597 --> 00:39.573
The challenges of working as a dietitian in the NHS...

00:39.715 --> 00:44.683
...is that you are referred many patients and it's keeping on top of caseloads....

00:44.783 --> 00:47.988
...when you have many other responsibilities to take into account.

00:48.260 --> 00:50.635
So, it's the challenges of being able to do that...

00:50.725 --> 00:53.623
...and feel like you're doing a proper job without cutting corners...

00:53.813 --> 00:57.018
...because fundamentally, patient care is a priority.
