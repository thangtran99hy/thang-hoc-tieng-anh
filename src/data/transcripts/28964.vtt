She's a mom and a nurse and a grandma and a cancer survivor at the same time.

00:03.831 --> 00:06.403
She just inspires me to take on more and more.

00:06.670 --> 00:08.634
I think she's stronger than she thinks she is.

00:08.917 --> 00:12.559
When she knows that we're happy, she gets happy.

00:12.692 --> 00:16.733
If my family was a wolf pack, she would probably be the alpha.

00:16.904 --> 00:18.950
She's always really kind to everybody.

00:19.127 --> 00:20.267
She is the family.

00:20.873 --> 00:23.840
She's definitely the glue that holds us together.

00:24.233 --> 00:25.929
I hope to be as great of a mom as she is.

00:26.663 --> 00:28.970
She's just done everything for us.

00:29.972 --> 00:32.579
If there could only be two people left on Earth,...

00:32.715 --> 00:34.957
...just me and one other person, I would choose her.

00:36.389 --> 00:38.399
Yeah, she makes me feel really special.

00:38.739 --> 00:42.091
She means really the universe to me.

00:44.384 --> 00:46.566
I wouldn't be the person who I am today without her.

00:46.733 --> 00:51.637
You give me confidence to be the lady that I want to be.

00:53.025 --> 00:54.206
You're the mom.

00:54.635 --> 00:55.496
You're the mom!

00:56.417 --> 00:58.164
You should teach other people how to mom.
