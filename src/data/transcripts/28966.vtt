00:09.179 --> 00:12.924
Well, I also had a secret life while I was in the Air Force.

00:13.161 --> 00:15.929
Yeah, I helped to build nuclear weapons.

00:16.479 --> 00:16.887
What?

00:18.083 --> 00:21.332
And this is what I had to wear.

00:21.395 --> 00:22.394
Oh my gosh.

00:23.137 --> 00:24.319
I was a football player.

00:25.329 --> 00:26.495
That's crazy, honest...

00:26.608 --> 00:27.761
Wow, it's crazy.

00:28.173 --> 00:29.229
I played on the freshman team.

00:29.867 --> 00:31.746
I played safety and wide receiver.

00:32.492 --> 00:33.725
There's no way you played wide receiver.

00:33.799 --> 00:34.687
Do you see my arms?

00:36.280 --> 00:37.228
I went to college.

00:38.691 --> 00:39.747
You went to college?

00:40.629 --> 00:42.413
I dropped out to become a mom.

00:43.764 --> 00:45.025
At the time, it was best for me.

00:46.566 --> 00:47.978
It's putting my daughter first.

00:48.517 --> 00:50.435
I said no crying, no messing up makeup.

00:52.977 --> 00:55.889
Because of you, I know that I'm gonna end up surviving in this world.

00:58.876 --> 00:59.575
I'm sorry.

01:00.497 --> 01:03.332
You mean the universe to me.

01:04.081 --> 01:06.360
Yeah, I'm just, I'm really glad you're my mom.

01:08.412 --> 01:08.955
I love you too.
