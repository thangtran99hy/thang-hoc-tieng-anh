00:00.694 --> 00:02.583
When you arrive at the dentist's office,...

00:02.790 --> 00:05.986
...you will probably sit down for a few minutes in a waiting room.

00:06.334 --> 00:08.350
There may be paperwork for you to sign.

00:08.869 --> 00:10.639
When it is time for your exam,...

00:11.057 --> 00:15.479
...a person called a dental hygienist will bring you to a special exam room.

00:18.459 --> 00:21.356
A dental hygienist is the person who cleans your teeth.

00:26.168 --> 00:28.781
You'll be asked to sit down in a special chair.

00:34.101 --> 00:36.581
The hygienist will also have you wear a bib.

00:36.921 --> 00:41.225
The bib will keep you clean in the event that toothpaste or other materials...

00:41.305 --> 00:43.690
...accidentally drop on you during your visit.

00:48.109 --> 00:51.730
If you have teeth that hurt, you should tell the dental hygienist.

00:52.605 --> 00:55.976
If your teeth hurt when you eat or drink, let them know.

00:56.825 --> 01:01.005
The hygienist will wear a mask on their face and gloves on their hands...

01:01.118 --> 01:02.453
...to prevent the spread of germs.

01:03.148 --> 01:06.929
During your exam, the hygienist will slowly look throughout your mouth...

01:07.277 --> 01:08.647
...and at each of your teeth.

01:08.807 --> 01:11.587
It will be necessary for them to use a small mirror...

01:11.661 --> 01:14.735
...to look at areas of your mouth that are difficult to see.
