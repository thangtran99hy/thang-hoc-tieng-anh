00:00.122 --> 00:00.870
ï»¿Okay, Kobe.

00:01.258 --> 00:03.905
You were an NBA star as a teenager.

00:04.598 --> 00:08.637
What was it like having a giant paycheck at such a young age?

00:11.393 --> 00:12.328
I don't get paid.

00:12.669 --> 00:13.059
Okay.

00:14.040 --> 00:14.636
Let's see.

00:15.349 --> 00:15.811
Not yet.

00:17.918 --> 00:18.407
It was awesome.

00:19.118 --> 00:20.436
There's worse problems to have.

00:22.707 --> 00:23.643
So yeah, it's pretty cool, yeah.

00:24.958 --> 00:25.809
What was the first thing you bought?

00:25.880 --> 00:26.707
Do you remember what you bought?

00:27.263 --> 00:28.114
What was the first thing I bought?

00:28.235 --> 00:29.104
I bought...

00:30.979 --> 00:31.978
...nothing actually.

00:32.055 --> 00:33.540
I put it in a bank and I saved it.

00:34.428 --> 00:36.063
Hey, that's a good idea, right there.

00:37.083 --> 00:37.553
That's good.

00:38.417 --> 00:41.569
I think we all wanna know who's the next Kobe Bryant.

00:46.357 --> 00:46.626
Let's see.

00:46.709 --> 00:48.399
Well, Kawhi Leonard is amazing.

00:48.496 --> 00:49.440
I actually love Kawhi.

00:49.514 --> 00:50.373
I love James Harden.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.400
I love Russell Westbrook.

00:51.521 --> 00:54.214
But hopefully, they'll take the game above and beyond...

00:54.319 --> 00:55.991
...anything that I have ever accomplished.
