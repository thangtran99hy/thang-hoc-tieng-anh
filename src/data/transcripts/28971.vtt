ï»¿Have you ever wondered what makes up a tooth?

00:08.008 --> 00:11.062
The two main parts of the tooth are the crown and the root.

00:11.574 --> 00:13.722
The crown is the white part of the tooth you can see.

00:14.101 --> 00:16.187
The root is unseen below the gumline.

00:16.699 --> 00:18.991
Each tooth is made up of four different tissues:...

00:19.243 --> 00:22.593
...enamel, dentin, pulp and cementum.

00:23.356 --> 00:26.823
Enamel, one of the hardest parts of your body, covers the crown...

00:26.909 --> 00:28.805
...and protects the tooth from everyday use.

00:29.489 --> 00:34.395
Dentin is the softer layer which supports the enamel and helps absorb pressure from eating.

00:35.057 --> 00:36.929
At the center of the tooth is the pulp.

00:37.310 --> 00:40.374
Pulp nourishes the tooth and houses nerves and blood vessels.

00:40.848 --> 00:43.355
And lastly, covering the root is the cementum.

00:43.741 --> 00:46.041
The cementum helps attach a tooth to the jawbones.

00:46.629 --> 00:49.005
Good oral health care and regular dental visits...

00:49.251 --> 00:52.615
...help to keep all parts of your smile healthy and beautiful.

00:53.225 --> 00:56.145
