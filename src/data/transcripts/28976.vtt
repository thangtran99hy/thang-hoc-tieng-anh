WEBVTT

00:00.490 --> 00:02.981
I'm a medical secretary in a medical office.

00:03.081 --> 00:09.078
We answer the phone, greet patients, pull charts and files, answer any questions...

00:09.439 --> 00:11.103
...and schedule appointments.

00:11.485 --> 00:17.445
You not only get to work with people, you also get to meet new people each and every day.

00:17.552 --> 00:19.011
That's my favorite part of the job.

00:19.131 --> 00:24.463
I did go back and get a two-year degree at a local college,...

00:24.597 --> 00:26.577
...but majority of it is on-the-job training.

00:26.971 --> 00:29.868
We work a normal business day from 8 to 5.

00:30.213 --> 00:34.493
I particularly like the hours and sometimes we get Fridays off, so I really like that.

00:34.747 --> 00:38.258
The salary range, I would say, would be based on your experience.

00:38.535 --> 00:39.166
The money's good.

00:39.320 --> 00:43.555
My favorite part about my job is probably just meeting different people each day.

00:43.687 --> 00:48.189
My favorite part about my job is being involved with the people.
