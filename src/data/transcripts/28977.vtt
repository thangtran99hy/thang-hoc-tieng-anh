Just take a few tips from people like Thomas C. Corley...

00:02.572 --> 00:04.821
...who has studied tons of self-made millionaires.

00:05.104 --> 00:07.643
They read every day and not celebrity gossip.

00:07.999 --> 00:10.535
Think biographies, self-help, and history books.

00:10.854 --> 00:13.515
Corley says 88% of ridiculously rich people...

00:13.572 --> 00:16.509
...spend at least 30 minutes a day reading to gain knowledge.

00:16.646 --> 00:18.163
They mingle with other rich people...

00:18.237 --> 00:20.143
...and cut out toxic people from their lives.

00:20.389 --> 00:22.657
They also keep in touch with people even when they don't need them...

00:22.929 --> 00:24.027
...for a new job, for instance.

00:24.519 --> 00:26.381
They constantly wish people happy birthday,...

00:26.609 --> 00:28.625
...call to say hi and volunteer.

00:28.964 --> 00:30.058
The rich keep getting richer...

00:30.298 --> 00:31.965
...because they know where to funnel their money.

00:32.309 --> 00:33.908
Corley says most millionaires he studied...

00:33.999 --> 00:35.725
...seemed to have three sources of income.

00:36.087 --> 00:39.097
For most of them, real estate rentals, stock market investments,...

00:39.207 --> 00:40.497
...and owning a side business.
