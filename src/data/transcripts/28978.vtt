Good morning, Dr. Hayes office, Taryn speaking.

00:04.487 --> 00:05.215
Hi, good morning.

00:05.279 --> 00:06.528
This is Ernesto Sanchez.

00:06.833 --> 00:09.072
The doctor told me I need to come in today for my heart,...

00:09.323 --> 00:11.692
...but I forgot to make an appointment and I don't have a ride anyway.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.563
Okay, Mr. Sanchez, what is your date of birth?

00:14.931 --> 00:17.182
03-25-76.

00:17.285 --> 00:18.363
And when were you last seen?

00:18.611 --> 00:19.912
Last week, in the hospital.

00:20.160 --> 00:22.217
Can you hold for just a minute while I pull your chart, please?

00:22.406 --> 00:22.793
Yes.

00:23.167 --> 00:23.419
Thank you.

00:23.497 --> 00:24.055
It won't be long.

00:27.139 --> 00:28.580
Thank you for holding, Mr. Sanchez.

00:29.561 --> 00:30.019
Not a problem.

00:30.423 --> 00:31.919
Dr. Hayes really needs to see you today.

00:32.273 --> 00:34.932
I can give you an appointment for this afternoon at two o'clock.

00:35.319 --> 00:37.929
It's really important that she see you because of your hospital stay.

00:38.301 --> 00:40.036
Why don't you call Dial-A-Ride to get here?

00:40.434 --> 00:42.144
We'll be glad to call them when you're ready to leave.

00:42.650 --> 00:43.294
That sounds great.

00:43.504 --> 00:44.465
I haven't even thought of that.

00:44.849 --> 00:47.279
Thank you for making the appointment even though I forgot to call.

00:47.999 --> 00:49.268
Oh, it's no problem at all.

00:49.653 --> 00:50.783
Our concern is your health.

00:51.447 --> 00:52.948

00:54.948 --> 00:56.009
Yes, and thank you again.

00:56.149 --> 00:56.673
No problem.
