ï»¿This is such an old saying but it's all about who you know.

00:04.768 --> 00:08.376
The way I got my job in a massive city pub in Brisbane...

00:08.491 --> 00:12.596
...was I overheard some of the girls in the hostel say that...

00:12.848 --> 00:16.079
...this place was looking for someone to come on...

00:16.194 --> 00:18.075
...because a couple of backpackers there were leaving.

00:18.450 --> 00:21.097
So, literally, I was up, went downstairs to the internet cafe,...

00:21.276 --> 00:23.534
...printed off my recent resume and I was out.

00:23.695 --> 00:25.763
And when you get there, sell yourself.

00:25.905 --> 00:28.711
You hear  about job advertisements, you get there immediately...

00:29.192 --> 00:30.944
...and you say, "I heard you're looking for someone."

00:31.099 --> 00:33.629
Even if, you know, even if you haven't...

00:33.965 --> 00:35.689
...but you think that they might  be looking for someone,...

00:35.959 --> 00:36.607
...sell yourself.

00:36.777 --> 00:39.521
Don't ever just ask for the manager and hand over your CV...

00:39.836 --> 00:42.245
...because when I worked in bars and we get people who come in...

00:42.335 --> 00:45.101
...and just pass a CV over, it's not very impressive.

00:45.281 --> 00:46.111
Sell yourself.

00:46.559 --> 00:49.917
Almost demand trial in a very polite way.

00:50.069 --> 00:51.015
Don't be rude now.

00:51.333 --> 00:53.357
No one likes it when you're rude, alright?

00:53.631 --> 00:55.555
You're not gonna get a job being rude, okay?
