You can help us expedite the boarding process...

00:10.143 --> 00:13.375
...by keeping the entryway clear until your row is called.

00:15.239 --> 00:16.693
Hi everybody, do you mind if I squeeze through?

00:16.776 --> 00:18.117
I'm just operating the flight, please.

00:18.630 --> 00:19.463
I don't think so.

00:19.935 --> 00:22.080
We would like to offer a courtesy boarding...

00:22.215 --> 00:25.262
...to those customers traveling with children under the age of two...

00:26.258 --> 00:29.089
...and those customers needing additional assistance.

00:29.206 --> 00:31.667
Oops, oops, oops. Sorry.

00:31.805 --> 00:35.192
We will now continue boarding with rows 20 and higher.

00:36.410 --> 00:36.811
Hi.

00:36.918 --> 00:37.381
Hi!

00:37.787 --> 00:39.987
Sorry sir, we're only boarding rows 20 and higher.

00:41.013 --> 00:41.749
What about now?

00:41.923 --> 00:44.505
No, you're sitting in row 14, so in a few minutes.

00:45.549 --> 00:46.305
I'll come back.

00:46.622 --> 00:47.574
That's great, thank you.
