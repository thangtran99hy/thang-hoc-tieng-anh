00:00.675 --> 00:01.837
ï»¿When you're learning English,...

00:02.317 --> 00:05.384
...there are three very important parts of pronunciation.

00:06.317 --> 00:11.889
They are word stress, sentence rhythm and intonation.

00:13.113 --> 00:15.311
Today, we're going to look at the first two,...

00:16.277 --> 00:19.342
...how you can practice word stress and sentence rhythm together...

00:19.834 --> 00:21.551
...to improve your spoken English.

00:22.819 --> 00:26.477
Listen to this sentence closely for word and sentence stress.

00:28.045 --> 00:29.576
I don't think we should blame moderate,...

00:29.689 --> 00:32.753
...intelligent exposure to sunlight throughout our lives...

00:33.188 --> 00:37.334
...as the culprit for markedly increasing our risk of developing skin cancer.

00:38.821 --> 00:42.737
Notice that the speaker uses many words with more than one syllable.

00:43.433 --> 00:45.755
That is common in formal academic language.

00:46.757 --> 00:48.575
But when you come across longer words,...

00:48.997 --> 00:51.160
...you have to learn which syllable to stress.

00:52.198 --> 00:57.856
For example, we say "intelligent", "increasing" and "markedly".

00:59.191 --> 01:01.323
Notice that when you stress one syllable,...

01:01.925 --> 01:04.355
...the vowels in the other syllables are shortened.

01:05.394 --> 01:11.673
Sometimes, these short syllables become a schwa, an 'uh' sound or an 'i'.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.701
They're short, relaxed sounds.

01:15.790 --> 01:21.283
Listen to "moderate", "intelligent", "exposure", "culprit",...

01:22.102 --> 01:25.831
..."markedly", "developing", "cancer".

01:27.075 --> 01:30.987
This shortening of syllables preserves the overall sentence rhythm.

01:31.956 --> 01:33.005
Listen to the clip again.

01:34.754 --> 01:36.292
I don't think we should blame moderate,...

01:36.408 --> 01:39.495
...intelligent exposure to sunlight throughout our lives...

01:39.905 --> 01:44.042
...as the culprit for markedly increasing our risk of developing skin cancer.

01:45.131 --> 01:48.924
Making your spoken English sound natural takes a lot of practice.

01:49.940 --> 01:53.925
Don't forget to listen closely to vowel sounds and sentence stress...

01:54.441 --> 01:57.890
...and remember to practice reading and writing in English every day.

01:59.128 --> 02:00.310
And that's all from me today.

02:00.852 --> 02:03.763
I'll see you next time on Study English, bye!
