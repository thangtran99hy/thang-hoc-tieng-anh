ï»¿The small space lifestyle, you're going to make choices...

00:03.951 --> 00:07.423
...and you end up becoming really conscious of what you bring into your life.

00:09.921 --> 00:14.055
Round tables can be really wonderful because they don't have corners and edges.

00:14.206 --> 00:18.796
The roundness actually makes you feel like it's taking up less volume.

00:20.904 --> 00:23.882
We use transforming furniture in both of the bedrooms...

00:24.323 --> 00:26.415
...because it allows us flexibility.

00:26.517 --> 00:29.245
So, when the kids are not in the bed there's no need for the bed...

00:29.326 --> 00:30.705
...and it gives them more play space,...

00:30.813 --> 00:34.069
...which gives us so much more freedom and flexibility.

00:36.289 --> 00:38.491
Open shelving is another one.

00:38.771 --> 00:41.691
It's gonna make you think about the objects that you buy.

00:43.896 --> 00:47.193
I really believe in these canvas storage bins by Pehr Design.

00:47.493 --> 00:50.743
They're flexible, they can move in any direction...

00:51.103 --> 00:53.339
...and can be folded up and packed flat.

00:53.462 --> 00:57.008
And they're really my secret to how I pull this all off.

00:59.283 --> 01:01.589
I tend to love plants in a space.

01:01.682 --> 01:03.720
They, you know, mirror the outside.

01:04.175 --> 01:08.419
They produce oxygen in the space so it makes a space feel bigger as well...

01:08.520 --> 01:12.079
...because you're taking in more oxygen and more light into your world.

01:13.190 --> 01:16.115
Take a moment to think about what you have...

01:16.440 --> 01:20.631
...and start thinking about how it's serving you in your life, what it means to you,...

01:20.749 --> 01:24.131
...and if there's even one thing you can get rid of today, do it.
