Today, Commander Whitson, you have broken the record...

00:04.800 --> 00:08.827
...for the most total time spent in space by an American astronaut:...

00:09.641 --> 00:12.337
534 days and counting.

00:13.445 --> 00:15.365
That's an incredible record to break,...

00:16.233 --> 00:21.033
...and on behalf of our nation and frankly, on behalf of the world,...

00:21.766 --> 00:25.351
...I'd like to congratulate you. That is really something.

00:25.435 --> 00:30.709
And I'd like to know, how does it feel to have broken such a big and important record?

00:34.053 --> 00:37.680
Well, it's actually a huge honor to break a record like this,...

00:37.882 --> 00:43.334
...but it's an honor for me basically to be representing all the folks at NASA...

00:43.871 --> 00:50.285
...who make the space flight possible and who make me setting this record feasible.

00:50.801 --> 00:54.137
And so, it's a very exciting time to be at NASA.

00:54.451 --> 01:00.187
We are all very much looking forward as directed by your new NASA bill.

01:00.357 --> 01:03.572
We're excited about the missions to Mars in the 2030s.
