People often call IT professionals about network connection problems.

00:04.634 --> 00:06.999
But many problems are easy to fix without help.

00:07.449 --> 00:11.486
First, reconnect any loose CAT5 cable connections.

00:11.794 --> 00:14.778
Next, investigate IP address issues.

00:15.147 --> 00:18.193
This group of numbers allows communication on the internet.

00:18.577 --> 00:22.119
Renewing your DHCP fixes most IP problems.

00:22.534 --> 00:24.082
Next, check the router.

00:24.492 --> 00:27.290
The router links LANs to the internet.

00:27.921 --> 00:30.625
Make sure the router's configuration is correct.

00:31.262 --> 00:34.061
WLANs have other problems.

00:34.447 --> 00:37.369
Interference often blocks their wireless signals.

00:37.613 --> 00:39.235
But there is a simple solution.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.845
Just move the router away from walls and metals.

00:42.182 --> 00:44.114
Finally, cycle the network.

00:44.676 --> 00:47.846
Turn all equipment off for a full minute and then restart.
