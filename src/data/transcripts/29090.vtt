If you wanna be a world traveler start by...

00:03.088 --> 00:04.682
Ooh, is that a Galaxy S8?

00:05.006 --> 00:05.924
Handsome screen.

00:06.345 --> 00:08.872
Anyway, you wanna pack that, your passport and...

00:09.051 --> 00:10.283
Oh okay, we're moving fast.

00:12.409 --> 00:14.591
To get around the city, take the city bus.

00:15.561 --> 00:16.222
That's not a bus.

00:17.654 --> 00:18.533
You'll need a tour guide.

00:19.543 --> 00:20.347
Apparently not.

00:21.553 --> 00:22.635
Don't forget a big camera.

00:23.569 --> 00:24.764
Or that phone will work.

00:26.157 --> 00:27.953
Traveling by yourself can be lonely.

00:28.271 --> 00:30.051
And you've already made friends.

00:31.688 --> 00:32.991
Huh, look fancy.

00:36.302 --> 00:38.383
Shopping can be difficult if you don't know the language.

00:38.535 --> 00:41.007
Oh,  never mind, your camera speaks Spanish.

00:42.903 --> 00:45.019
Hold up, is that a king?

00:45.757 --> 00:46.513
Where are you?

00:47.775 --> 00:49.291
Oh, your camera knows that, too.

00:52.549 --> 00:55.021
Okay, I guess you have the world traveler thing covered.
