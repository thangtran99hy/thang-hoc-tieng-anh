ï»¿Billie Jean King, already a champion of women's rights,...

00:04.487 --> 00:06.899
...is now the most successful female player of all time.

00:07.044 --> 00:09.365
I am not saying that women don't belong on the court.

00:09.687 --> 00:10.849
Who would pick up the balls otherwise?

00:10.997 --> 00:11.801
Oh my God.

00:11.956 --> 00:14.501
There isn't a single thing I don't hate about Bobby Riggs.

00:14.611 --> 00:15.281
You know what I'm doing?

00:15.411 --> 00:15.669
I'm cooking.

00:16.555 --> 00:17.113
I'm cooking.

00:17.396 --> 00:18.464
I won the triple at Wimbledon.

00:18.669 --> 00:19.879
I could beat Billie Jean King.

00:20.085 --> 00:21.035
Does she have the nerve?

00:21.324 --> 00:21.824
Call Bobby.

00:21.987 --> 00:22.617
Tell him it's on.

00:24.869 --> 00:27.215
So, Billie Jean, what do you want?

00:29.157 --> 00:33.309
But don't get me wrong, I love women in the bedroom and in the kitchen.

00:33.721 --> 00:34.809
Keep talking, Bobby.

00:35.079 --> 00:37.313
The more nonsense you spout, the worse it's gonna be when you lose.

00:41.170 --> 00:42.025
I'm gonna be the best.

00:42.585 --> 00:44.601
That way, I can really change things.

00:46.575 --> 00:48.912
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to put the "show" back in chauvinism.

00:49.113 --> 00:49.995
Bobby's a clown.

00:50.555 --> 00:51.703
This whole thing is an act for him.

00:54.010 --> 00:57.051
Business, sports, you name it, at the very top, it's a man's world.

00:57.778 --> 01:00.677
It's when we want a little bit of what you've got, that's what you can't stand.

01:01.177 --> 01:04.843
Forty million people are watching the battle you've all been waiting to see.

01:05.027 --> 01:06.219
I'm done talking, let's play.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.190
The Battle of the Sexes.
