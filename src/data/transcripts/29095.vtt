The first movie that made a big impression on me was Princess Bride.

00:06.631 --> 00:08.084
"My name is Inigo Montoya."

00:08.195 --> 00:08.977
"You killed my father."

00:09.191 --> 00:10.108
"Prepare to die."

00:10.506 --> 00:15.383
I think that "The Never-ending Story" was the first movie crush that I had.

00:16.478 --> 00:18.744
Atreyu was his name?

00:19.099 --> 00:21.641
He was the boy from the book, the warrior...

00:21.818 --> 00:25.875
...and I just remember watching this movie for like, 20 times.

00:26.475 --> 00:30.303
I had a thing for boys with long hair when I was nine.

00:33.637 --> 00:36.646
I was 18, I just graduated high school...

00:36.703 --> 00:39.286
...and I had some time in between going to the army.

00:39.553 --> 00:42.409
My mom figured, "Hey, why don't I send your photo?"

00:42.586 --> 00:46.539
"You finished school and this is like, proper pageant."

00:46.687 --> 00:47.201
Whatever.

00:47.503 --> 00:50.937
I got in and I never thought I would win.

00:51.635 --> 00:54.509
And then I won, and then it scared me.

00:55.049 --> 00:59.998
I was like, "What? Miss Israel? All the responsibility of being Miss Israel."

01:00.363 --> 01:02.643
But did you go to Miss Universe as Miss Israel?

01:02.730 --> 01:04.847
Yes, and I was very naughty.

01:04.995 --> 01:06.738
I was very, I wasn't behaving.

01:06.808 --> 01:11.085
I'm a really good girl but because I was afraid I'm gonna win again,...

01:11.204 --> 01:14.088
...because I didn't want to win the Miss Israel pageant and then I won,...

01:14.251 --> 01:17.652
...I figured, "Oh no, I don't want them to choose me again."

01:18.221 --> 01:21.617
So, I came down late to all the rehearsals...

01:21.727 --> 01:26.812
...and I wasn't wearing the right evening gowns for breakfast.

01:27.088 --> 01:30.527
I even remember Paula Abdul, she was one of the judges there...

01:30.585 --> 01:35.141
...and she was asking me a question and I was like, "I'm sorry, English not so good,"...

01:36.530 --> 01:38.869
...because I just didn't wanna have anything to do with that.
