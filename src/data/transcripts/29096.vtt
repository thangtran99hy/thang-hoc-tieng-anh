Welcome to the Loser Lounge,...

00:02.468 --> 00:05.258
...where emojis who never get used hang out.

00:05.411 --> 00:06.062
What's up, High Five?

00:08.042 --> 00:10.628
I'm an emoji, I gotta have some sort of purpose here.

00:10.773 --> 00:11.489
I'm gonna help you.

00:11.599 --> 00:13.975
We need to get off the phone and find the source code.

00:14.159 --> 00:14.921
Then I can fit in!

00:15.161 --> 00:15.952
Let's roll.

00:16.163 --> 00:16.987
Bye, Felicia.

00:18.826 --> 00:20.963
First, we have to get through this firewall.

00:21.977 --> 00:23.326
What's Alex's girlfriend's name again?

00:23.555 --> 00:24.503
It was...

00:25.403 --> 00:25.680
Tina.

00:26.978 --> 00:28.055
Access Denied.

00:28.191 --> 00:28.489
Karen.

00:29.392 --> 00:29.899
Sarah.

00:30.760 --> 00:34.151
I wanna say Lupita but that doesn't feel right now I'm saying it out loud.

00:35.434 --> 00:37.594
I think you're pretty cool just the way you are.

00:43.383 --> 00:44.781
Nobody leaves the phone.

00:45.427 --> 00:46.109
Delete them!

00:46.811 --> 00:48.088
My feelings are huge.

00:48.419 --> 00:50.754
Maybe I'm meant to have more than just one emotion.

00:51.683 --> 00:52.199
Where am I?

00:52.589 --> 00:53.865
Candy crush.

00:54.104 --> 00:54.828
Divine.

00:55.234 --> 00:55.705
Sweet.

00:56.089 --> 00:56.615
Tasty.

00:57.165 --> 00:58.309
Delicious.

00:59.169 --> 01:01.741
I'm never eating another piece of candy ever again.

01:03.971 --> 01:05.150
High Five, don't do it.

01:06.447 --> 01:08.639
Don't you do it, it's already been in there once.
