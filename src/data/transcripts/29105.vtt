Enemies to the east,...

00:09.036 --> 00:10.443
...enemies to the west,...

00:12.646 --> 00:14.044
...enemies to the south,...

00:16.249 --> 00:17.633
...enemies to the north.

00:20.089 --> 00:24.436
Whatever stands in our way, we will defeat it.

00:27.325 --> 00:28.893
We're the last Lannisters,...

00:31.031 --> 00:32.233
...the last ones who count.

00:38.389 --> 00:44.561
I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms and I will.

00:49.948 --> 00:51.345
The King in the North!

00:52.049 --> 00:54.502
Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand,...

00:56.919 --> 00:59.238
...last best hope against the coming storm.

01:05.131 --> 01:08.289
If we don't put aside our enmities and band together, we will die.

01:10.678 --> 01:13.938
And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.

01:23.430 --> 01:25.241
The Great War is here.
