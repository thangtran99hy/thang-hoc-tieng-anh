00:00.555 --> 00:01.371
You're not dying.

00:01.839 --> 00:02.652
What did you just say?

00:02.881 --> 00:05.101
Stella, you're cured.

00:09.807 --> 00:13.108
So, what are you gonna do with the first day of the rest of your life?

00:13.375 --> 00:14.173
I'll get a job.

00:14.803 --> 00:15.926
How are you planning on doing that?

00:16.135 --> 00:21.535
The same way that every millennial with a funky haircut and no college education does.

00:22.305 --> 00:23.493
I will be a barista.

00:23.729 --> 00:25.296
It's Tymothi with an "i".

00:25.629 --> 00:26.143
Got it.

00:26.445 --> 00:29.137
Actually, the "i" is at the end.

00:30.071 --> 00:30.955
Seriously?

00:32.827 --> 00:34.202
We didn't have a future.

00:34.437 --> 00:37.794
But now we do, and I want us to be honest with each other about who we are.

00:39.246 --> 00:41.634
Tell me one good reason why I shouldn't fire you.

00:41.824 --> 00:42.779
I have cancer.

00:43.373 --> 00:44.138
Is that true?

00:44.543 --> 00:46.181
Not the cancer part.

00:46.639 --> 00:48.419
The cancer part was the only part.

00:52.492 --> 00:57.405
I used to have all the answers but now, I don't know anything at all.

00:57.961 --> 00:59.257
You beat certain death.

00:59.431 --> 01:02.155
I think you can figure out how to handle uncertain life.

01:05.110 --> 01:06.769
So, there it was,...

01:06.967 --> 01:11.871
...the end of my cancer movie, but the beginning of my life sentence,...

01:12.243 --> 01:13.966
...which was full of promise.

01:14.337 --> 01:21.624
For the first time since I found out I wasn't dying, I was truly happy to be alive.
