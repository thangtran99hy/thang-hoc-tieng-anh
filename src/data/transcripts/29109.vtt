My parents are squatting in an abandoned building on the Lower East Side.

00:07.011 --> 00:09.871
Do you honestly tell me that you're happy right now?

00:10.219 --> 00:11.435
Yes, I am.

00:16.993 --> 00:18.500
We ain't like other people.

00:18.635 --> 00:21.183
We got a fire burning in our bellies.

00:21.373 --> 00:24.513
You were born to change the world, not just add to the noise.

00:24.613 --> 00:26.341
Why do you think all of us ran away from you?

00:28.195 --> 00:29.087
We were drowning.

00:33.239 --> 00:35.428
I would never let anything bad happen to you.

00:35.652 --> 00:39.179
But I can't let you cling to the side your whole life just because you're scared.

00:39.279 --> 00:41.567
It was your job to protect us.

00:42.012 --> 00:43.599
You have a right to be angry.

00:43.706 --> 00:44.799
I know you love him.

00:44.973 --> 00:46.561
You'll regret it if you don't come home.

00:48.620 --> 00:49.175
You ready?

00:52.983 --> 00:53.723
Let's go!

00:58.277 --> 00:59.410
You ain't like me.

00:59.766 --> 01:01.994
I am like you and I'm glad.
