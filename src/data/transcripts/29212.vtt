ï»¿Depending on what part of your body needs to be x-rayed,...

00:05.427 --> 00:07.264
...you might have to put on a hospital gown.

00:09.427 --> 00:13.097
You'll also need to take off all jewelry, watches and glasses.

00:13.504 --> 00:15.921
Metal gets in the way of taking a clear picture.

00:17.326 --> 00:22.019
The x-ray technician, tech for short, takes you to the room with the x-ray machine...

00:22.123 --> 00:24.965
...and a table to sit on, lie on or stand beside.

00:28.067 --> 00:30.369
Think of the x-ray machine as a giant camera.

00:32.472 --> 00:35.387
The tech will help you get into the best position for the x-ray.

00:36.386 --> 00:38.617
You can help by trying to hold very still.

00:40.019 --> 00:42.299
Then the tech will move to a little room nearby,...

00:42.539 --> 00:44.589
...where she'll press the button to take the x-ray.

00:44.896 --> 00:45.641
Here we go.

00:45.736 --> 00:46.499
Stay still.

00:48.281 --> 00:49.737
This usually is very quick.

00:51.845 --> 00:55.453
You'll probably hear a clicking or buzzing sound as the picture is being snapped.

00:56.179 --> 00:58.187
The tech will tell you when it's okay to move.

00:58.475 --> 00:58.753
Okay.

00:58.872 --> 00:59.695
Picture's done.

01:00.823 --> 01:02.762
When it's all done, you can get dressed.
