ï»¿When I'm in the Intensive Care Unit, I'm in charge of the team of nurses and doctors...

00:05.206 --> 00:06.929
...who look after the sick children here.

00:07.874 --> 00:11.890
In an average year, we look after something like 1,400 children...

00:12.188 --> 00:14.362
...from tiny, tiny babies to teenagers.

00:14.545 --> 00:17.975
Most days, we have 17, 18 or 19 children here...

00:18.393 --> 00:21.795
...who are on breathing machines, who have had cardiac operations,...

00:22.207 --> 00:26.418
...who have had accidents, who have got illnesses that they have got infections.

00:26.845 --> 00:30.419
So every day, we are busy looking after the children in the intensive care unit.

00:30.792 --> 00:31.425
This is Jovie.

00:31.954 --> 00:36.554
Jovie is two and a half months old, and Jovie's been born with a problem,...

00:36.962 --> 00:39.735
...which means that when she falls asleep, she doesn't breathe.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.557
But it's obviously a very serious condition...

00:42.706 --> 00:45.400
...because without a breathing machine, she'd die.

00:46.807 --> 00:50.568
Jovie is small and sometimes she actually forgets to breathe when she is awake as well.

00:51.189 --> 00:55.094
So Jovie is on the breathing machine day and night at the moment.

00:55.683 --> 00:57.316
We're hoping that as she gets bigger,...

00:57.755 --> 01:00.873
...she'll be able to come off the breathing machine during the day,...

01:01.523 --> 01:05.406
...but for the rest of Jovie's life, she'll actually be on the breathing machine...

01:05.803 --> 01:06.447
...when she's asleep.
