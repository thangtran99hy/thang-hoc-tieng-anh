00:04.913 --> 00:05.631
ï»¿We've been robbed!

00:05.829 --> 00:06.056
What?

00:07.681 --> 00:08.921
They took everything!

00:09.074 --> 00:09.683
They took Buddy.

00:11.224 --> 00:12.073
Well, where are you going?

00:12.201 --> 00:13.131
I'm gonna go and get my dog!

00:14.133 --> 00:15.000
I didn't see anything.

00:15.245 --> 00:16.662
They stole my dog.

00:16.863 --> 00:18.547
A delicacy in my country, right?

00:18.928 --> 00:19.989
I never said that.

00:20.218 --> 00:20.737
You thought it.

00:22.405 --> 00:23.580
I'm gonna need your help, John.

00:25.326 --> 00:25.931
Okay.

00:26.646 --> 00:27.943
Wear extra underpants.

00:29.409 --> 00:29.933
Why?

00:32.869 --> 00:33.965
So, you want the dog back?

00:35.747 --> 00:36.534
It's the only thing I want.

00:36.655 --> 00:39.881
Lupe took your dog and a briefcase full of my cocaine.

00:40.111 --> 00:41.799
You find her, I'll give your dog back.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.092
Got an address on that?

00:43.311 --> 00:44.135
Google it, homes.

00:48.502 --> 00:49.001
What are you doing?

00:50.705 --> 00:52.170
I gotta go steal back some drugs...

00:54.406 --> 00:55.680
...then get my dog back.

00:56.079 --> 00:56.620
Wanna come?

00:56.905 --> 00:57.826
It sounds like fun.

00:58.167 --> 00:58.965
Could be dangerous.

01:00.168 --> 01:00.793
Maybe I'll die.
