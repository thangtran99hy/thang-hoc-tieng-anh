00:01.236 --> 00:08.665
Somewhere over the rainbow,...

00:09.807 --> 00:13.891
...skies are blue.

00:15.089 --> 00:27.618
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.

00:28.209 --> 00:39.761
Someday I'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are far behind me,...

00:42.077 --> 00:45.433
...where troubles melt like lemon drops.

00:45.922 --> 00:55.610
High above the chimney top, that's where you'll find me.

00:56.091 --> 01:08.793
Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly

01:09.941 --> 01:21.512
Birds fly over the rainbow, why then, oh why can't I?
