00:05.543 --> 00:09.527
You and me, we made a vow,...

00:11.208 --> 00:14.725
...for better or for worse.

00:17.038 --> 00:20.726
I can't believe you let me down.

00:21.075 --> 00:25.767
But the proof's in the way it hurts.

00:28.673 --> 00:33.293
For months on end, I've had my doubts,...

00:34.543 --> 00:38.077
...denying every tear.

00:40.457 --> 00:44.233
I wish this would be over now.

00:44.525 --> 00:48.859
But I know I still need you here.

00:50.141 --> 01:01.151
You say I'm crazy because you don't think I know what you've done.

01:02.009 --> 01:12.843
But when you call me, baby I know I'm not the only one.
