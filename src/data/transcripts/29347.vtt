ï»¿Who is the child?

00:11.960 --> 00:12.923
I don't know.

00:14.796 --> 00:17.492
But she's with you.

00:21.139 --> 00:22.487
She has no one else.

00:24.403 --> 00:25.931
We are not savages.

00:26.539 --> 00:29.069
Apes fight only to survive.

00:30.082 --> 00:31.955
Bad humans kill apes.

00:33.013 --> 00:35.105
All dead now, long time.

00:35.919 --> 00:36.750
Long time.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.193
Bad humans?

00:38.410 --> 00:39.123
Soldier.

00:45.376 --> 00:48.853
Years from now, your children, they'll ask you,...

00:49.991 --> 00:52.550
"What did you do in the greatest war?"

00:53.070 --> 00:57.679
And you can tell them, "I fought to protect this world."
