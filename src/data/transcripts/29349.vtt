Cancer is an abnormal growth of cells that has the potential to spread to different areas.

00:04.885 --> 00:09.551
A tumor is just a growth of cells, which can be benign, which won't spread...

00:09.823 --> 00:12.069
...or malignant, which is indeed cancerous.

00:12.427 --> 00:18.295
Ninety-five percent of cancers are caused by environmental factors and only 5% from genetics.

00:18.801 --> 00:23.507
The most common causes are obesity, tobacco, viral infections, radiation...

00:23.587 --> 00:25.093
...and environmental pollutants.

00:25.473 --> 00:30.078
Cancer is pretty darn scary because it can happen to anybody at any time,...

00:30.472 --> 00:34.500
...but you can lower your chances by being overall healthy, not using tobacco or drugs...

00:34.589 --> 00:36.681
...and getting your vaccinations.

00:37.065 --> 00:40.418
Precancerous cells are actually somewhat common in everybody's body.

00:41.003 --> 00:42.983
So why don't we all get cancer?

00:43.561 --> 00:46.113
Our body has tons of defense mechanisms against it.

00:46.509 --> 00:50.893
Precancerous cells will receive antigrowth signals, will be attacked by our immune system...

00:50.981 --> 00:54.462
...and often go through apoptosis, which is killing themselves.

00:54.889 --> 00:57.029
When all of these cancer defense mechanisms fail,...

00:57.239 --> 01:00.132
...or there are too many precancerous cells for our bodies to fight off,...

01:00.435 --> 01:01.921
...cancer will occur.

01:02.685 --> 01:04.537
Once our bodies fail at controlling it,...

01:04.619 --> 01:06.949
...modern medicine still has plenty of ways to fight it, though.

01:07.587 --> 01:11.618
Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, immunotherapy and others...

01:11.709 --> 01:14.649
...are all great ways to assist your body in fighting off the cancer.
