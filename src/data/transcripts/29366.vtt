Asthma is a chronic disease of the lungs...

00:06.430 --> 00:08.539
...and it can occur as early as six months.

00:08.663 --> 00:10.329
It can occur later in life as well.

00:10.679 --> 00:13.945
Normally, the way your lung functions is that you have airways...

00:14.023 --> 00:18.135
...that go from your mouth into your lungs and they end up in little air sacs.

00:18.379 --> 00:20.801
In the normal lung, those tubes are wide open.

00:21.077 --> 00:23.233
It makes it very easy for air to flow in and out.

00:23.630 --> 00:27.163
In somebody with asthma, those tubes or airways are narrow...

00:27.311 --> 00:29.923
...because the wall of the tube is inflamed,...

00:30.077 --> 00:33.382
...so that makes it more difficult to breathe in someone with asthma.

00:33.457 --> 00:34.527
It's like breathing through a straw.

00:34.955 --> 00:38.815
Children with asthma can have different signs, also known as symptoms.

00:38.903 --> 00:41.073
Asthma can look many different ways.

00:41.382 --> 00:43.457
Some children may cough with their asthma.

00:43.599 --> 00:44.432
Some children wheeze.

00:44.551 --> 00:46.857
Some children work really hard to breathe,...

00:46.957 --> 00:49.485
...using their chest muscles and their stomach muscles.

00:49.734 --> 00:52.073
They may cough when they exercise.

00:52.582 --> 00:55.060
They may cough when they go out in the cold air.

00:55.245 --> 00:58.305
Coughing or waking after midnight, in the middle of the night,...

00:58.467 --> 00:59.989
...that's the most severe symptom.
