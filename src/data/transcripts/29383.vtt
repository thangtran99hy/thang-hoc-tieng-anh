00:00.879 --> 00:04.843
ï»¿Now, I know that many convocation speeches...

00:04.977 --> 00:09.733
...hinge on the variation of the "Do big things" mantra.

00:10.709 --> 00:11.606
And that's important.

00:13.136 --> 00:15.129
But I also think that it's equally important...

00:15.223 --> 00:21.486
...to talk about the idea of "doing the small things in a big way".

00:22.307 --> 00:24.319
Maybe doing small things in a big way...

00:25.127 --> 00:28.363
...means giving that extra 10 bucks a month to charity,...

00:29.212 --> 00:30.156
...if you really believe in it.

00:30.757 --> 00:35.586
Or sending your mom flowers on a day other than Mother's Day.

00:37.151 --> 00:39.785
Or striking up a friendly conversation with someone...

00:39.863 --> 00:41.885
...who looks totally different from you.

00:43.764 --> 00:46.640
Or trading your car for a bike, when the sun's out.

00:47.893 --> 00:51.505
Whether you realize it or not, these things matter.

00:53.658 --> 00:58.546
That extra 10 bucks just brought textbooks for a girl trying to get an education.

00:59.233 --> 01:00.117
Those flowers?

01:00.859 --> 01:02.556
Well, they just made your mom's whole week.

01:03.760 --> 01:07.395
Your new friend's story will help you understand your own identity....

01:07.460 --> 01:09.445
...in a totally different light.

01:10.577 --> 01:11.278
And that bike?

01:12.772 --> 01:14.291
Well, that bike is saving the planet.

01:15.869 --> 01:23.117
Your actions, today and tomorrow, big and small, have an impact.

01:25.035 --> 01:30.323
So, be kind, say please and thank you, and hold the door.

01:32.158 --> 01:36.521
At this exact moment, you're all worried about what you're going to do...

01:37.675 --> 01:39.230
...but don't worry about that stuff.

01:40.481 --> 01:43.928
Figure out instead who you're going to be.

01:45.879 --> 01:46.886
The rest will follow.

01:48.078 --> 01:49.208
So, let me leave you with this.

01:51.586 --> 01:58.762
If it excites you a lot and scares you a little, then you should probably do it.

02:00.321 --> 02:05.234
Be bold, be brave, be open to the incredible opportunities in front of you.

02:05.899 --> 02:08.978
Class of 2017, we need you.

02:09.503 --> 02:11.169
The world needs you.

02:12.012 --> 02:14.555
So, be the best versions of yourselves...

02:16.018 --> 02:17.162
...and go make us all proud.
