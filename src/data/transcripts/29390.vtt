ï»¿These days, helmsmen often rely on iron mikes, or Ottos, to stay on course.

00:06.974 --> 00:10.927
But remember that you still have important responsibilities when in the pilot house.

00:11.571 --> 00:16.221
Your vessel's steering gear uses extremely powerful electrohydraulic systems.

00:16.746 --> 00:18.721
It must be operated with great care.

00:20.259 --> 00:22.720
Even though gyropilots do most of the steering,...

00:22.946 --> 00:25.057
...you must sometimes take the wheel yourself.

00:25.848 --> 00:29.364
This usually happens in difficult conditions or emergencies.

00:30.405 --> 00:34.845
Always know which officer has the conn so you know whom to take directions from.

00:36.147 --> 00:39.155
Docking is an especially important task for a helmsman.

00:39.926 --> 00:42.279
Your rudder is not effective at slow speeds,...

00:42.575 --> 00:45.209
...so you must be able to maneuver with the bow thruster.
