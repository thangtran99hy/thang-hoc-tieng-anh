00:00.201 --> 00:02.736
One of the simplest ways to improve your travel experience...

00:02.802 --> 00:05.395
...is to make sure you're well-rested before you take off.

00:05.509 --> 00:07.602
Even better, the night before you fly,...

00:07.747 --> 00:11.973
...adjust your watch to local time at your destination to help your body get adjusted.

00:13.338 --> 00:13.974
Dress right.

00:14.191 --> 00:17.510
Airplanes get really cold, and a lot of them don't even give you a blanket.

00:17.625 --> 00:20.165
So you need to dress warm and wear layers.

00:20.333 --> 00:23.415
Jacket, scarves and wool socks are a great call.

00:23.540 --> 00:24.705
Pack good gear.

00:24.821 --> 00:28.188
If you plan to sleep, eye shades, a neck pillow and earplugs...

00:28.263 --> 00:29.943
...are crucial and easy to pack.

00:30.060 --> 00:33.709
Noise-cancelling headphones are great, as are Kindles and tablets.

00:33.785 --> 00:35.360
Just make sure you charge everything...

00:35.575 --> 00:39.185
...and download any videos, podcasts or e-books you want before you fly.

00:41.837 --> 00:42.430
Move around.

00:42.517 --> 00:43.833
Flying is not natural.

00:43.935 --> 00:47.337
It impedes your circulation, which can lead to deep vein thrombosis.

00:47.437 --> 00:51.095
Avoid this by taking a lap around the airplane or doing some simple exercises.
