00:00.827 --> 00:01.742
Can I have your attention?

00:03.607 --> 00:04.554
You're all dismissed.

00:05.601 --> 00:05.988
Bankrupt?

00:06.643 --> 00:07.811
Better luck with your next job.

00:13.638 --> 00:15.113
This is not the life I promised you.

00:15.814 --> 00:16.617
Not even close.

00:25.423 --> 00:27.988
Girls, I think I have an idea.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.485
P.T. Barnum at your service.

00:39.557 --> 00:43.203
We're putting together a show and I need a star.

00:45.381 --> 00:47.049
Everyone of us is special.

00:48.275 --> 00:50.640
And nobody is like anyone else.

00:51.533 --> 00:52.642
That's the point of my show.

00:53.982 --> 00:54.361
Ready?

00:55.686 --> 00:56.241
Showtime.

00:58.264 --> 01:00.640
No one ever made a difference by being like everyone else.
