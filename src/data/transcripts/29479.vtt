ï»¿I'm gonna be there at the finish line for you.

00:02.457 --> 00:04.103
I'm gonna make a big sign for you!

00:04.597 --> 00:06.096
He doesn't show up for anything.

00:08.886 --> 00:09.899
Then, he shows up.

00:21.087 --> 00:24.677
There was an explosion, and your legs, they're gone, bro.

00:30.077 --> 00:30.722
I can't do this.

00:30.809 --> 00:32.125
I can't, I can't do it.

00:32.239 --> 00:35.005
This is the first time you're in this week and you had three appointments.

00:35.086 --> 00:36.299
You just have to show up.

00:36.383 --> 00:36.919
Show up?

00:37.230 --> 00:38.967
I showed up for you.

00:42.301 --> 00:43.499
You remind me of my son.

00:44.357 --> 00:44.769
He died.

00:45.795 --> 00:49.201
Helping you made me feel like I had helped my son.

00:49.665 --> 00:50.869
And for that, I am grateful.

00:51.668 --> 00:52.346
You're grateful.

00:55.384 --> 00:56.053
I'm gonna walk.

00:56.231 --> 00:58.171
You know, I'm gonna walk with you again someday.
