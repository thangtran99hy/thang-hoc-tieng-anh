00:02.919 --> 00:06.629
A wonderful way to appreciate this bizarre landscape is from above.

00:07.427 --> 00:13.404
That's why for me, the most exciting balloon ride anywhere in or near Europe is here in Cappadocia.

00:15.325 --> 00:20.039
You get up before sunrise and gather on a desolate field that's become a hive of activity.

00:23.109 --> 00:25.085
Nearly every morning, the scene is the same...

00:25.275 --> 00:28.345
...as noisy burners are fired up and balloons filled.

00:31.259 --> 00:33.611
Climbing into the basket, you meet your captain.

00:34.120 --> 00:35.101
Good morning, everybody!

00:35.401 --> 00:35.666
Morning.

00:35.735 --> 00:36.374
Hi, Mustafa.

00:36.508 --> 00:37.377
My name is Mustafa.

00:37.657 --> 00:39.771
Your pilot was sick, so I will fly you today.

00:40.809 --> 00:42.829
This will be my first day in aviation and I'm really excited.

00:47.717 --> 00:52.099
With the sound of a fire-breathing dragon, you skim the grass and slowly lift off.

00:52.839 --> 00:54.015
While scary for some,...

00:54.326 --> 00:58.375
...the feeling I get is one of graceful stability with majestic views.

00:58.813 --> 01:03.425
Soon, scores of tourist-filled balloons share the sky in silent wonder.
