ï»¿Yup, this is a branded Kentucky Fried Chicken phone, newly available in China.

00:04.744 --> 00:08.312
Well, it turns out Asian countries are pretty obsessed with the chain.

00:08.411 --> 00:13.019
Japan has been crazy over the Colonel's spices ever since a marketing campaign...

00:13.115 --> 00:16.687
...turned visiting the fast food chain on Christmas into a tradition.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.287
Okay, I'm stuck.

00:18.440 --> 00:21.789
The high-tech collaboration with Chinese phone maker Huawei...

00:21.900 --> 00:25.873
...is to celebrate the chain's 30th anniversary of selling buckets of chicken there.

00:25.961 --> 00:29.037
And based on the phone's specs, we think the Colonel would approve.

00:29.162 --> 00:30.086
We certainly hope so.

00:30.591 --> 00:32.372
Our entire marketing campaign depends on it.

00:32.525 --> 00:37.721
The seven-inch phone in KFC red comes with a KFC app and something called K-Music,...

00:37.849 --> 00:41.865
...which lets you pick the restaurant's music, which for me would be the chicken dance.

00:41.992 --> 00:45.533
You can buy the phone for a respectable $161.
