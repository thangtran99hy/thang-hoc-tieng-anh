ï»¿Why is it important to take your family on vacation?

00:06.060 --> 00:07.259
They work a lot.

00:07.469 --> 00:10.983
When your dad or mom goes to work, you don't get to see them that much.

00:11.106 --> 00:15.947
My parents always go on business trips, so they deserve a little break.

00:19.167 --> 00:20.851
Where would you like to take your parents?

00:22.739 --> 00:23.419
Albany.

00:23.510 --> 00:24.012
Albany?

00:24.305 --> 00:26.440
Because it's the capital of famous New York.

00:26.581 --> 00:28.500
To the Dominican Republic.

00:29.179 --> 00:30.940
I mean the North Carolina.

00:31.024 --> 00:31.307
I forgot.

00:31.642 --> 00:33.413
I kinda forgot, let me just...

00:33.597 --> 00:34.727
No, you take your time!

00:35.891 --> 00:40.378
Anywhere with too many fur animals there,...

00:40.469 --> 00:43.811
...I cannot go because my dad is allergic to any kind of fur.

00:44.059 --> 00:46.151
Any other must-haves for this vacation?

00:46.331 --> 00:47.811
You need to have a bathroom.

00:47.933 --> 00:49.637
Okay, I'm writing these down.

00:50.183 --> 00:52.005
Yeah, of course a diving board!

00:52.086 --> 00:52.765
Okay, okay.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.166
Then I can dive.

00:54.349 --> 00:59.129
How much do you think that this whole flight and hotel would cost?

01:01.970 --> 01:02.814
Four bucks.

01:04.227 --> 01:04.955
You're right.

01:05.271 --> 01:10.375
One, two, that should do it.

01:15.073 --> 01:18.271
Three flights and hotel for Tampa Bay, Florida.

01:18.389 --> 01:20.383
I want to see the world with my parents.
