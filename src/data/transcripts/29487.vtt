ï»¿In 1632, Hezarfen flew from the very top of the Galata Tower...

00:07.471 --> 00:09.295
...and soared across the Bosphorus.

00:09.744 --> 00:12.317
And so the Turks learned how to fly.

00:20.194 --> 00:25.207
The rest night knows, and we, and the tower that sees,...

00:25.475 --> 00:28.063
...and the light showed me a path through the sea.

00:29.809 --> 00:33.859
Justinian sent two monks from here, out in Silk Road to China...

00:34.159 --> 00:36.167
...to steal the secret of Chinese cloth.

00:36.727 --> 00:41.317
They returned with silkworm eggs, and from them, hatched an empire.

00:42.765 --> 00:45.199
Istanbul, there are always two.

00:45.867 --> 00:46.657
Two cities.

00:47.021 --> 00:47.913
Two speeds.

00:48.313 --> 00:53.481
Slow and fast.

00:54.027 --> 00:55.607
It stands, always.

00:55.906 --> 00:58.233
The world's capital.
