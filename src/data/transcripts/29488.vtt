ï»¿What are you thinking?

00:07.837 --> 00:09.387
It's too dangerous to stay here.

00:11.296 --> 00:13.738
When you're talking about pulling out, just say it's because you are afraid.

00:18.081 --> 00:20.004
They were used as human shields by the rebels.

00:20.930 --> 00:24.556
We have enough blood for only one of the patients to survive the night.

00:25.597 --> 00:27.745
So, do you wanna pick?

00:28.926 --> 00:31.099
We are playing God to a lucky few.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.483
Leave, if you can't take it anymore.

00:32.690 --> 00:33.544
Is that what you learned to do?

00:33.607 --> 00:35.019
Is it what you've taught yourself to do?

00:35.104 --> 00:36.427
I'm different now.

00:42.919 --> 00:45.669
We stay not because we think we're gonna save the world.

00:46.779 --> 00:48.413
I know what these people are thinking.

00:49.643 --> 00:51.795
I wanna do anything I can to stop this.
