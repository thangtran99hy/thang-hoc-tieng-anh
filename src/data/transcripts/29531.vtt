We looked around and we noticed that almost everyone around us had phones...

00:06.346 --> 00:08.375
...and everyone was complaining about their phones.

00:09.839 --> 00:12.521
And we thought, "Could we build something better?"

00:13.114 --> 00:14.312
You know, it's a roller coaster ride.

00:14.634 --> 00:16.181
And if it ain't scary, it ain't fun.

00:19.053 --> 00:22.716
Steve came to one of our design meetings and he said, "This isn't good enough."

00:23.300 --> 00:24.326
Like, "This is it."

00:24.504 --> 00:27.579
"You have to come up with something so much better."

00:27.754 --> 00:29.070
"This is not good enough."

00:29.451 --> 00:32.449
Everyone got up and started demoing the keyboards they've created.

00:32.763 --> 00:34.685
And some of these were just crazy.

00:34.793 --> 00:37.245
I mean, you do these gestures,...

00:37.359 --> 00:40.879
...these super complex gestures that were really hard to learn.

00:41.199 --> 00:45.070
Was multi-touch touch screen actually going to deliver a "good enough?"

00:46.087 --> 00:51.009
And how good is "good enough" compared to this keyboard, this Crackberry keyboard?
