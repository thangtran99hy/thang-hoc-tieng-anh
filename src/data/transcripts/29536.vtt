ï»¿Dad, I need to rest.

00:03.214 --> 00:04.808
He complains of chronic fatigue.

00:05.334 --> 00:07.016
You did not notice those signs?

00:08.306 --> 00:10.891
Whatever his condition, he's not fine.

00:19.065 --> 00:22.127
You're having an increasingly difficult time hanging on to clients.

00:23.090 --> 00:23.721
Should I be worried?

00:24.006 --> 00:25.745
No, I want the job bad.

00:26.485 --> 00:27.366
This is when you show up.

00:28.677 --> 00:31.077
What do we need to do to turn this around?

00:31.249 --> 00:33.887
Cancer is not a negotiation, Mr. Jensen.

00:34.351 --> 00:35.965
I haven't heard from you in a while.

00:36.399 --> 00:37.221
Everything alright?

00:37.636 --> 00:38.663
Yeah, family issues.

00:38.733 --> 00:39.391
I'll figure it out.

00:39.549 --> 00:40.257
Want to talk about it?

00:40.767 --> 00:41.425
Maybe I can help.

00:41.884 --> 00:43.380
We're your family, Dane.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.047
You're gonna wish you had this time back.

00:51.319 --> 00:52.009
My dad's coming.

00:52.310 --> 00:53.631
I asked him if we could go somewhere.

00:56.480 --> 00:57.637
Are you closing a deal without me?

00:59.557 --> 01:02.691
He is the only one that makes me feel safe.

01:11.585 --> 01:14.775
Every family has its issues but you only have one family.

01:15.868 --> 01:17.034
You don't want the job, is that it?

01:17.965 --> 01:20.365
Everything I need, I already have.
