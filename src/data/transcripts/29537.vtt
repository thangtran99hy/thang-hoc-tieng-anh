Last time I googled myself...

00:04.689 --> 00:07.209
...was pretty much the last time I googled myself...

00:07.704 --> 00:08.845
...because I don't do it anymore...

00:08.933 --> 00:10.038
...because it's really bad.

00:10.151 --> 00:10.765
Like, don't do it.

00:10.830 --> 00:11.862
Don't google yourself, ever.

00:12.969 --> 00:14.794
People have a lot of opinions on my butt.

00:18.037 --> 00:19.020
First time I met a super fan.

00:19.543 --> 00:21.183
I think the first time was in Barneys.

00:21.623 --> 00:23.483
That was when it was like, super-duper fan,...

00:23.851 --> 00:28.989
...when the elevator doors opened and then someone was just like, "Khaleesi!"

00:29.353 --> 00:30.697
And then the doors closed, and then I left, so that was kind of okay.

00:34.799 --> 00:39.293
The first time I met Jason Momoa was in a hotel lobby in Belfast.

00:39.671 --> 00:44.333
And I walk in and I'm like, exhausted and I have my bags and I'm really tired...

00:44.401 --> 00:46.709
...and we just, it was really late at night and I walked in...

00:46.816 --> 00:51.287
...and from the other side of this enormous lobby I hear, "Wifey!"

00:51.718 --> 00:55.567
And this huge Hawaiian man comes bounding over to me,...

00:56.055 --> 01:00.049
...picks me up and genuinely gets me in like, a rugby tackle to the floor.

01:00.511 --> 01:02.162
It was only when he picked me back up and kinda dusted me off...

01:02.292 --> 01:02.977
...and I was like, "Who are you?"
