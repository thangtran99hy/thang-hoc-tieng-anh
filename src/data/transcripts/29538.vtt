ï»¿The most important thing is to eat the ramen while it's hot.

00:04.198 --> 00:07.355
Any good ramen shop will serve you a bowl of ramen that's smoking hot.

00:08.123 --> 00:11.747
And you need to eat it right away because the noodles are overcooking.

00:11.991 --> 00:13.058
It's  a lot like pizza.

00:13.359 --> 00:16.845
If you're a real New Yorker, you know that you don't wait until the pizza cools down.

00:16.914 --> 00:19.174
You eat it while it's hot and you risk burning your mouth.

00:20.001 --> 00:21.708
Ramen is absolutely the same.

00:26.901 --> 00:27.539
You need to slurp.

00:27.921 --> 00:30.025
What it does is it cools down the noodles.

00:30.595 --> 00:31.516
Don't fight the noodles.

00:33.211 --> 00:35.027
Take a little less than you think you want to eat.

00:35.613 --> 00:37.071
You wanna pull them out from the pile...

00:37.214 --> 00:38.894
...because otherwise you'll never be able to slurp.

00:41.527 --> 00:43.593
Easy on the toppings if you're a first-timer.

00:44.255 --> 00:47.671
So, when you order your first bowl of ramen ever, just get it simple.

00:48.380 --> 00:48.777
Taste it.

00:48.877 --> 00:50.019
See if you really like ramen.

00:50.220 --> 00:52.014
And then you can start dumping on the toppings...

00:52.103 --> 00:54.504
...and going for the shop's special of the day.
