00:00.581 --> 00:02.369
Meanwhile, in the Batcave.

00:02.557 --> 00:04.644
Some days you just can't get rid of a bomb.

00:06.911 --> 00:08.977
Always inspect a jukebox carefully.

00:11.207 --> 00:13.179
These machines can be deadly.

00:13.441 --> 00:15.231
I know you'd employ your sneezing powder.

00:16.036 --> 00:17.705
So, I took an anti-allergy pill.

00:19.878 --> 00:22.153
Uh-oh, better put five cents in the meter.

00:22.477 --> 00:24.651
It's sometimes difficult to think clearly...

00:24.739 --> 00:26.390
...when you're strapped to a printing press.

00:26.833 --> 00:29.321
We've come a long way from the Prime Minister's exploding cake.

00:30.916 --> 00:31.505
Or have we?

00:32.253 --> 00:34.003
You can't get away from Batman that easy!

00:34.147 --> 00:34.439
Easily.

00:35.155 --> 00:35.581
Easily.

00:35.916 --> 00:37.553
Good grammar is essential, Robin.

00:38.133 --> 00:39.710
Where'd you get a live fish, Batman?

00:39.955 --> 00:43.688
A true crime fighter always carries everything he needs in his utility belt, Robin.

00:44.743 --> 00:46.815
Gosh Batman, is there anything you don't know.

00:48.050 --> 00:48.576
Oh yes, Robin.

00:49.067 --> 00:50.045
Several things, in fact.

00:50.381 --> 00:53.393
They maybe drinkers, Robin, but they're also human beings.

00:54.091 --> 00:56.968
I'll do everything I can to rehabilitate you.

00:57.547 --> 00:58.203
Marry me.

00:59.181 --> 01:00.357
Everything except that!
