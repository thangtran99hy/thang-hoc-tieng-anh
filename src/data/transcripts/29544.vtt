00:01.473 --> 00:02.797
Sam's gonna start dating.

00:03.064 --> 00:04.826
You and I, weren't much older when we met.

00:04.979 --> 00:07.019
Maybe it's time for us to take a step back.

00:08.205 --> 00:09.433
You wanna know how to get the girls?

00:09.754 --> 00:11.015
I'm taking you to Poon City.

00:11.661 --> 00:12.785
That's not a real place.

00:13.517 --> 00:13.807
Nope!

00:14.377 --> 00:14.966
Not doing that!

00:16.703 --> 00:17.714
There are strategies.

00:17.859 --> 00:18.543
You could teach him.

00:18.699 --> 00:19.806
I'm not a little kid anymore.

00:19.937 --> 00:20.923
I can do things!

00:21.022 --> 00:22.864
Strategies for when you get your heart broken?

00:23.510 --> 00:25.002
Sometimes, I wish I was normal.

00:26.150 --> 00:28.228
Hey dude, nobody's normal.

00:31.323 --> 00:34.502
Your son has the same desire to be loved that we all do.

00:34.745 --> 00:35.152
Paige!

00:35.271 --> 00:36.365
Why shouldn't he pursue it?

00:40.860 --> 00:42.585
My family is fragile.

00:42.754 --> 00:44.901
Everything is "Sam this" and "autism that".

00:44.965 --> 00:46.287
It's time for you to have your own life.

00:47.595 --> 00:50.802
Whoever first said "Practice makes perfect" was an idiot.

00:51.765 --> 00:53.181
Humans can't be perfect...

00:54.087 --> 00:55.438
...because we're not machines.

00:57.617 --> 01:01.487
The best thing that you can say about practice is that it makes better.
