00:05.777 --> 00:07.723
Nothing's gonna go back to the way that it was.

00:11.236 --> 00:11.792
Not really.

00:14.389 --> 00:15.235
I saw something.

00:18.717 --> 00:19.309
What is it?

00:21.760 --> 00:22.865
I don't know.

00:24.051 --> 00:26.363
I felt it everywhere.

00:29.203 --> 00:32.035
Darkness falls across the land.

00:32.801 --> 00:35.659
The midnight hour is close at hand.

00:36.486 --> 00:39.202
Creatures crawl in search of blood...

00:40.046 --> 00:42.485
...to terrorize your neighborhood.

00:44.091 --> 00:46.540
And whosoever shall be found...

00:46.729 --> 00:49.363
Sometimes I feel like I still see her.

00:50.929 --> 00:54.369
...must stand and face the hounds of hell...

00:55.103 --> 00:58.695
...and rot inside a corpse's shell.

01:01.431 --> 01:04.429
If you're out there, just please give me a sign.
