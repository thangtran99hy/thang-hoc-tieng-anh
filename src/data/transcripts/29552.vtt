ï»¿Let me guess, you've got some downtime and are scrolling through Facebook,...

00:03.106 --> 00:05.657
...liking everyone's photos but you're not commenting.

00:05.973 --> 00:09.328
What if I told you Facebook likes could be turning you into an idiot?

00:09.481 --> 00:12.342
That's according to new research so don't shoot the messenger.

00:12.479 --> 00:15.497
Likes are dumbing down the way people communicate with each other...

00:15.647 --> 00:18.773
...and stop us from responding intelligently, according to Salon.

00:18.945 --> 00:21.896
The digital era overload brings on thoughtless commentary...

00:22.001 --> 00:23.832
...in the form of likes and reactions.

00:23.947 --> 00:26.721
Experts say having so many channels of communication...

00:26.807 --> 00:30.372
...makes for cheap and easy forms of interaction that doesn't require much thought.

00:31.114 --> 00:34.306
But some people are drawn to that sound and the likes they collect.

00:34.437 --> 00:38.296
Studies have shown the instant gratification of seeing how many people liked your post...

00:38.397 --> 00:42.063
...has a neurological effect similar to how we feel when eating something good,...

00:42.205 --> 00:44.892
...after working out, or when we're in the bedroom.

00:45.025 --> 00:46.771
That's according to Psychology Today.

00:46.953 --> 00:50.845
And don't lie, you know you get excited when your post gets a lot of likes.

00:50.976 --> 00:55.676
Still, experts say that tiny affirmations don't substitute for meaningful conversation.

00:55.848 --> 00:58.653
Instead, they recommend keeping a core social media group...

00:58.755 --> 01:00.687
...who provide thoughtful feedback.
