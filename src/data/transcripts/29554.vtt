ï»¿Is she deaf?

00:03.250 --> 00:05.119
Mute, Sir, she can hear you.

00:05.831 --> 00:08.165
You clean that lab, you get out.

00:11.048 --> 00:16.304
This may very well be the most sensitive asset ever to be housed in this facility.

00:18.725 --> 00:21.002
You may think that thing looks human.

00:21.254 --> 00:22.813
It stands on two legs, right?

00:23.531 --> 00:26.144
But we're created in the Lord's image.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.464
You don't think that's what the Lord looks like, do you?

00:28.835 --> 00:35.372
This creature is intelligent, capable of language, of understanding emotions.

00:45.481 --> 00:50.137
When he looks at me, he doesn't know how I am incomplete.

00:50.350 --> 00:53.746
He sees me as I am.

00:58.496 --> 01:01.913
If I told you about her, what would I say?

01:02.605 --> 01:03.319
I wonder.
