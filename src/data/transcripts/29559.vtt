00:00.531 --> 00:05.353
ï»¿A game for those who seek to find a way to leave their world behind.

00:05.571 --> 00:06.513
Jumanji.

00:07.263 --> 00:09.215
You pick a character and you're that person in the game.

00:09.302 --> 00:09.932
Which one do I pick?

00:10.200 --> 00:11.178
I don't think it matters that much.

00:11.578 --> 00:13.755
Moose Finbar, sounds like a badass.

00:14.332 --> 00:16.132
I'll be the curvy genius.

00:16.474 --> 00:18.241
Dr. Smolder Bravestone.

00:18.451 --> 00:20.218
I guess I'm Ruby Roundhouse.

00:37.369 --> 00:37.816
Guys!

00:42.706 --> 00:43.165
Oy vey!

00:43.817 --> 00:44.475
Where's the rest of me?

00:46.841 --> 00:47.249
My God!

00:47.531 --> 00:47.771
Fridge?!

00:49.281 --> 00:49.694
Yeah, I'm Fridge.

00:49.791 --> 00:50.081
Who are you?

00:50.209 --> 00:50.846
It's me, Spencer.

00:52.539 --> 00:53.112
Who is she?

00:53.436 --> 00:53.845
Martha?

00:55.511 --> 00:58.856
Why I'm wearing half a shirt and short shorts in the jungle?

00:58.952 --> 01:02.424
I think we got sucked into Jumanji and we've become the avatars we chose.

01:02.519 --> 01:03.302
So that means?

01:03.489 --> 01:03.858
Bethany?

01:05.862 --> 01:06.691
Oh no, Bethany.

01:06.931 --> 01:07.474
Don't look at it!

01:08.294 --> 01:09.403
No!

01:09.726 --> 01:11.149
I'm an overweight middle-aged man.

01:11.334 --> 01:13.789
I don't have my Claritin and all I see around here is pollen!

01:13.877 --> 01:15.567
Well, I don't have the top two feet of my body!

01:18.761 --> 01:20.135
Maybe we're all in a coma.

01:20.319 --> 01:20.589
What?

01:20.850 --> 01:23.208
That old game machine must have electrocuted us and now we're...

01:23.575 --> 01:24.246
Oh my God!

01:25.287 --> 01:26.542
You better get in there to save her.

01:26.622 --> 01:27.648
I am not gonna get in there!

01:27.727 --> 01:28.437
You get in there.

01:28.535 --> 01:29.503
Yeah, I got a backpack on.

01:29.707 --> 01:30.857
You don't get in water with a backpack.

01:30.989 --> 01:31.708
Everybody knows that.
