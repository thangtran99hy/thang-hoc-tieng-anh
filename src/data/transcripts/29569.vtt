00:00.958 --> 00:05.191
What is going on in London that involves the CIA and a terrorist strike?

00:05.887 --> 00:08.607
MI5 is committing every available asset to this.

00:10.297 --> 00:12.662
I think I've unlocked a source for a terrorist.

00:13.125 --> 00:14.666
I have an eye for talent.

00:15.344 --> 00:17.526
I trained you in the country's interest.

00:19.485 --> 00:20.402
What's your status?

00:20.497 --> 00:21.094
In danger.

00:21.207 --> 00:22.299
Someone is hunting me.

00:24.145 --> 00:25.867
I'm thinking I'm the only friend you've got.

00:29.306 --> 00:33.776
Our prisoner has gone to ground and I do not intend to let him stay there.

00:33.979 --> 00:37.551
Let the past go or it's gonna get in the way when it counts.

00:45.381 --> 00:48.041
Global viruses are the biggest threat to mankind,...

00:48.166 --> 00:49.672
...each one a ticking bomb.

00:49.803 --> 00:50.851
Incubation is fast.

00:50.984 --> 00:51.854
Start the timers.

00:51.957 --> 00:53.186
He has to be stopped.

00:53.298 --> 00:53.953
The meet is on.

00:54.113 --> 00:54.672
Three hours.

00:55.537 --> 00:57.039
When it's armed, you've got five minutes.

00:57.155 --> 00:58.120
Tell me how to stop it.

00:58.214 --> 00:58.898
You can't.

00:59.102 --> 01:00.418
Abort! Abort!

01:01.853 --> 01:04.122
In a different world, it doesn't come to this.

01:05.859 --> 01:06.794
Who is the target?

01:10.990 --> 01:12.361
There's no time for guessing.
