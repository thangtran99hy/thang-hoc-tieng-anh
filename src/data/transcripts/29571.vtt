ï»¿Now, I don't doubt for a second that these clueless people...

00:04.703 --> 00:07.435
...are still nice individuals with great intentions,...

00:07.576 --> 00:12.255
...but they do ask some questions that become pretty annoying after awhile.

00:12.809 --> 00:14.299
Here are a few examples.

00:15.417 --> 00:18.841
"You're Chinese, oh my goodness, I have a Chinese friend, do you know him?"

00:22.915 --> 00:23.425
No.

00:24.395 --> 00:25.643
I don't know him...

00:26.236 --> 00:29.517
...because contrary to your unrealistic expectations,...

00:29.895 --> 00:34.558
...I do not know every single one of the 1.35 billion Chinese people...

00:34.627 --> 00:35.773
...who live on planet Earth.

00:37.899 --> 00:41.478
People also tend to ask, "Where does your name come from?"

00:41.568 --> 00:45.703
And I really don't know how to answer that, so I usually stick with the truth.

00:46.381 --> 00:47.693
My parents gave it to me.

00:48.175 --> 00:49.725
Where does your name come from?
