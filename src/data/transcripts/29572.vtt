00:01.201 --> 00:02.377
ï»¿I just turned eighteen,...

00:02.453 --> 00:05.529
...and there are still so many things that I don't know about the world.

00:05.643 --> 00:09.401
But what I do know is that it's hard to admit that you might be part of the problem,...

00:09.543 --> 00:12.073
...that all of us might be part of the problem.

00:12.869 --> 00:17.841
So instead of giving you a step-by-step guide on how to not be racist towards Asians,...

00:18.605 --> 00:21.439
...I will let you decide what to take from this talk.

00:22.630 --> 00:25.388
All I can do is share my story.

00:27.893 --> 00:30.588
My name is Canwen, my favorite color is purple...

00:30.704 --> 00:33.563
...and I play the piano, but not so much the violin.

00:34.517 --> 00:37.308
I have two incredibly supportive, hardworking parents...

00:37.709 --> 00:39.567
...and one very awesome ten-year-old brother.

00:41.241 --> 00:44.541
I love calculus more than anything, despise eating rice...

00:44.706 --> 00:46.183
...and I'm a horrendous driver.

00:46.815 --> 00:50.693
But most of all, I am proud of who I am:...

00:51.555 --> 00:55.782
...a little bit American, a little bit Chinese and a whole lot of both.

00:56.533 --> 00:57.273
Thank you.
