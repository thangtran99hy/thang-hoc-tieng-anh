Darling, call Teddy.

00:03.344 --> 00:04.301
I've had an idea.

00:04.679 --> 00:06.683
A wheelchair that does his breathing for him?

00:07.560 --> 00:08.819
Are you sure it's safe?

00:10.629 --> 00:11.730
It's worked so far.

00:12.777 --> 00:14.076
You owe me five pounds.

00:14.707 --> 00:17.314
Why do you keep your disabled people in prison?

00:17.709 --> 00:19.657
No one's believed it's possible to live as you do.

00:19.997 --> 00:22.943
Well, we should open the gates and set them free.

00:23.165 --> 00:23.973
Bloody marvel.

00:24.636 --> 00:25.959
What now, open a world tour?

00:26.283 --> 00:27.587
Wouldn't that be an adventure?

00:29.063 --> 00:31.178
When I first became paralyzed, I wanted to die.

00:32.255 --> 00:33.785
My wife told me I had to live...

00:36.512 --> 00:37.631
...to see our son grow up.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.035
Your life is my life.

00:43.675 --> 00:45.277
I don't want to just survive.

00:46.257 --> 00:47.630
I want to truly live.

00:52.781 --> 00:53.263
My love.

00:54.410 --> 00:55.217
My life.
