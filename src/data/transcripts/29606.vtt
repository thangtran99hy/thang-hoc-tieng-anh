00:00.765 --> 00:05.918
ï»¿After ten years, a Greek general named Odysseus came up with a clever plan.

00:06.477 --> 00:09.715
He got the Greeks to build a giant wooden horse.

00:10.292 --> 00:13.325
There was space inside for some men to hide.

00:13.956 --> 00:17.233
Secretly some Greek soldiers climbed inside.

00:17.747 --> 00:20.817
Then the horse was left outside the city gates.

00:21.334 --> 00:24.861
The Greeks got into their boats and pretended to sail away.

00:25.695 --> 00:27.773
The Trojans were very excited.

00:28.303 --> 00:30.133
They thought they had won the war.

00:30.641 --> 00:33.744
They thought the horse was a gift to say sorry.

00:34.321 --> 00:39.037
Some of the Trojans did not believe this and wanted to burn the horse.

00:39.487 --> 00:40.925
No one listened to them.

00:42.003 --> 00:44.349
The horse was pulled inside the city.

00:44.745 --> 00:47.577
The Greek soldiers waited inside quietly.

00:48.059 --> 00:53.613
That night, when everyone was asleep, they climbed out and opened the city gates.

00:54.175 --> 00:57.789
The Greek army had come back and was waiting outside.

00:58.364 --> 00:59.793
They went into the city.

01:00.298 --> 01:03.782
The Trojans were all asleep and not ready to fight.

01:04.301 --> 01:06.118
The Trojans lost the battle.

01:06.564 --> 01:08.317
The Greeks burned the city.

01:09.024 --> 01:13.467
Menelaus took Helen back to Sparta, and that was the end of the war.
