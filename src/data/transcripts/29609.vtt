ï»¿Because most of what we know about the Trojan War comes from stories...

00:04.984 --> 00:09.352
...told to entertain people, we cannot be sure that it is true.

00:10.143 --> 00:15.429
Sometimes a storyteller would add things to the stories to make them more exciting.

00:16.067 --> 00:20.649
Sometimes, because the stories were being passed along by word of mouth,...

00:21.131 --> 00:24.156
...things got mixed up and the story was changed.

00:24.797 --> 00:28.533
However, we know the city of Troy did exist.

00:28.948 --> 00:34.672
In the 1870s a famous archeologist named Henry Schliemann found the ruins.

00:35.139 --> 00:38.387
Since then, many archeologists have searched there.

00:38.822 --> 00:43.890
There is evidence of some fighting and of a fire at about the right time.

00:44.691 --> 00:49.403
Because we have no written records, we cannot be sure about the details.

00:49.885 --> 00:53.799
We will never know whether Helen and Paris ever really lived.

00:54.427 --> 00:55.287
What do you think?
