ï»¿For thousands of years, humans ate what we could find or kill.

00:05.202 --> 00:08.435
We ate plants, nuts, and berries in the forest.

00:08.770 --> 00:10.473
We killed and ate animals.

00:10.819 --> 00:12.597
We were hunters and gatherers.

00:13.435 --> 00:16.725
Hunting and gathering was hard work and dangerous...

00:16.967 --> 00:20.397
...because your life depended on finding or catching food.

00:20.778 --> 00:23.621
And that depended on seasons and luck.

00:24.535 --> 00:29.269
Humans needed a more reliable system where there would be food all the time.

00:29.701 --> 00:32.482
We did not want to depend on nature and luck.

00:32.952 --> 00:37.859
We needed to find a way to grow our food where we lived, rather than find it.
