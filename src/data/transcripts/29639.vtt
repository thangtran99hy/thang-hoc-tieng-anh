Uber could finally hit the brakes on its many dramas...

00:04.399 --> 00:06.335
...now that the ride-sharing app company...

00:06.442 --> 00:10.173
...has offered its top job to a dark horse candidate.

00:10.405 --> 00:16.251
Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was offered Uber's CEO slot late Sunday...

00:16.498 --> 00:19.471
...after word of Uber's board pick leaked.

00:19.799 --> 00:20.772
As of this taping,...

00:20.888 --> 00:25.825
...we're still waiting for confirmation that Khosrowshahi has actually taken the job.

00:26.679 --> 00:30.599
He's had an interesting life having immigrated from Iran as a child...

00:31.023 --> 00:33.655
...then growing up partially without a father....

00:33.893 --> 00:37.511
...as his dad was not allowed to leave Iran for six years...

00:37.815 --> 00:40.817
...because he'd gone home to care for a sick relative.

00:41.277 --> 00:45.055
Understandably then, Khosrowshahi has been outspoken on Twitter...

00:45.261 --> 00:48.025
...about President Trump's immigration policies.
