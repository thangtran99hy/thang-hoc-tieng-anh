Hajj, the Islamic pilgrimage, is the largest annual pilgrimage in the world.

00:05.823 --> 00:08.795
It is a religious duty that Muslims should undertake if they are able...

00:09.177 --> 00:10.579
...at least once in their lives.

00:11.173 --> 00:14.778
It is both a collective undertaking and a deeply personal experience.

00:15.375 --> 00:19.515
One of the philosophies of the Hajj is that of spirituality and unity.

00:20.256 --> 00:21.921
All Muslims perform the same rites...

00:22.071 --> 00:24.581
...and are encouraged to share in a spirit of equality.

00:25.395 --> 00:29.645
All pilgrims are expected to remain in the states of purity and simplicity during the Hajj...

00:29.854 --> 00:30.776
...as much as possible.

00:31.353 --> 00:33.089
This includes wearing simple clothes,...

00:33.359 --> 00:36.704
...which for men, is two pieces of white, unsewn cloth.

00:37.087 --> 00:39.242
Women are not restricted to a specific color,...

00:39.506 --> 00:41.960
...but are also encouraged to wear non-elaborate clothing.

00:43.059 --> 00:46.341
It involves a series of rituals that take place in and around Mecca...

00:46.703 --> 00:48.550
...over a period of five to six days.

00:48.889 --> 00:52.711
Pilgrims perform Tawaf, in which they circle the Kaaba seven times...

00:52.837 --> 00:54.465
...in an anti-clockwise direction.

00:54.758 --> 00:57.407
Muslims believe that the rituals of the Hajj have their origin...

00:57.502 --> 00:58.993
...in the time of the prophet Abraham.

00:59.591 --> 01:03.537
Prophet Muhammad led the Hajj himself in 632, the year of his death.

01:04.247 --> 01:06.609
Saudi Arabia attracts around three million pilgrims...

01:06.723 --> 01:09.480
...every year from across the world for the Hajj.
