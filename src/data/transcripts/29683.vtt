Welcome to Sword and Cross Academy.

00:07.957 --> 00:09.619
She has no idea what she's in for.

00:10.965 --> 00:12.051
Did you come for your books?

00:12.363 --> 00:13.142
You're missing one.

00:13.339 --> 00:14.875
It's in Special Collections.

00:20.181 --> 00:20.760
Hey, wait!

00:26.195 --> 00:29.344
You seem really familiar to me, like I know you from somewhere.

00:29.428 --> 00:30.101
Is that possible?

00:30.371 --> 00:30.534
No.

00:32.936 --> 00:33.966
You got it bad, huh?

00:34.955 --> 00:36.725
Everything's connected to Daniel somehow.

00:37.457 --> 00:37.901
What's wrong?

00:38.141 --> 00:39.271
I just can't get past it.

00:39.507 --> 00:40.837
There is something between us.

00:51.883 --> 00:53.070
How is this possible?

00:53.695 --> 00:55.831
We've been in love for thousands of years.

00:58.920 --> 00:59.717
You didn't tell her?

01:00.103 --> 01:00.859
There's this curse...

01:01.790 --> 01:04.918
We fall in love, then all it takes is a kiss...

01:06.058 --> 01:06.550
...and she's gone.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.101
I remember everything.

01:10.902 --> 01:12.915
The curse always finds a way no matter what.

01:13.985 --> 01:14.831
I chose you.

01:16.043 --> 01:16.683
I chose love.
