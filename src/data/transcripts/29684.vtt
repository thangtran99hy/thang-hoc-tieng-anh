In some parts of Asia, pointing the soles of your feet at someone...

00:03.093 --> 00:05.853
...is seen as extreme rudeness and could easily get you into trouble.

00:06.074 --> 00:08.565
This is also true in Russia as well as parts of the Middle East.

00:08.891 --> 00:11.317
That's why when George W. Bush almost took a shoe to the head...

00:11.384 --> 00:12.952
...from an angry Iraqi journalist,...

00:13.187 --> 00:15.392
...it was more symbolic than it was an act of violence.

00:15.727 --> 00:17.519
A shoe was a dirty weapon aimed at the highest...

00:17.640 --> 00:19.155
...and most esteemed point of the body.

00:19.351 --> 00:22.431
In countries such as Thailand and China, putting your feet up on a chair...

00:22.583 --> 00:25.070
...and certainly any place near to where someone might put their head...

00:25.342 --> 00:26.701
...is seen as very disrespectful.

00:26.986 --> 00:30.441
The foot in most of Asia is seen as dirty and the head is sacred.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.123
If you are planning to travel to Asia,...

00:32.281 --> 00:34.552
...bear this in mind lest you rankle the locals.

00:34.677 --> 00:36.846
In parts of Asia, be careful when you write something down...

00:36.926 --> 00:39.363
...for someone as writing in red ink is seen as a curse.

00:39.703 --> 00:42.885
This is because in some Asian cultures, red ink was reserved for messages...

00:42.952 --> 00:43.928
...applying to the deceased.

00:44.156 --> 00:47.509
Filling in an official form in red, maybe even an arrival card,...

00:47.746 --> 00:50.664
...in countries such as Taiwan, Korea, Japan or Thailand...

00:50.959 --> 00:53.420
...is seen as bad form and perhaps a very bad omen.

00:53.718 --> 00:56.143
Red is reserved for the dead in an official environment.
