00:00.793 --> 00:03.173
Meet fashion model Han Hyun-min.

00:03.925 --> 00:06.640
He's young, gifted and black,...

00:08.032 --> 00:10.773
...but in South Korea, that can be something.

00:11.708 --> 00:15.183
Sixteen-year-old Han is half Nigerian, half Korean...

00:15.586 --> 00:18.361
...and is the first mixed-race model in South Korea.

00:19.030 --> 00:22.281
Growing up, Han was pointed out and talked about.

00:24.443 --> 00:27.272
Some mothers even told their children not to play with him.

00:28.124 --> 00:32.668
His agent overcame concerns putting Han on his books would be a huge gamble...

00:36.832 --> 00:40.270
...and he now regularly appears in glossy magazines...

00:40.805 --> 00:44.213
...and has walked more than 30 shows of Seoul Fashion Weeks.

00:46.131 --> 00:51.932
Han's still stared at, but now it's more for his model good looks than the color of his skin...

00:53.134 --> 00:57.621
...and he hopes his career will serve as an inspiration for the next generation...

00:57.986 --> 01:00.829
...of multiracial children in South Korea.
