ï»¿There's no one who has not been affected by this.

00:05.523 --> 00:06.551
Jeffrey, what's going on?

00:06.752 --> 00:07.366
I don't have a clue.

00:07.770 --> 00:09.403
Is anybody there, can anybody hear me?

00:14.571 --> 00:19.047
Guys, we got 32 elevators off the grid, all the upper floors are gone.

00:20.549 --> 00:21.513
Can anybody hear me?

00:21.589 --> 00:22.927
Metzie, it's Eddie.

00:23.155 --> 00:24.626
Baby, you're not gonna believe this.

00:26.690 --> 00:26.987
Hello?

00:27.178 --> 00:27.686
Oh, mom!

00:28.065 --> 00:28.959
Where the hell are you?

00:29.741 --> 00:31.401
We're still in the north tower.

00:31.626 --> 00:33.035
Can you please have her call my wife?

00:33.351 --> 00:33.648
Me too.

00:34.191 --> 00:35.462
Mom, listen to me.

00:36.596 --> 00:36.840
Hello?

00:46.259 --> 00:49.610
When something tragic happens, your heart and your soul...

00:49.807 --> 00:51.389
...latch onto what really matters.

00:51.466 --> 00:53.819
You don't know me, I'm calling you for your husband...

00:54.265 --> 00:56.425
...he wanted you to know that he loves you.

00:58.899 --> 01:01.611
It's a story about really honoring those that didn't make it...

01:01.752 --> 01:03.136
You gotta get out of this building now!

01:03.331 --> 01:05.112
...and those that did.
