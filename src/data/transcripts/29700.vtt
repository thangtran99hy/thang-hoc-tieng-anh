ï»¿IBM is betting the company on artificial intelligence.

00:04.389 --> 00:05.577
It is the next era.

00:05.922 --> 00:08.735
I mean, just think of this, and maybe an easy way to think of it is...

00:09.071 --> 00:13.394
...this is the third era of technology that's really all we've ever known.

00:13.829 --> 00:15.536
The first was machines that counted.

00:15.770 --> 00:17.887
And the second was things that were programmed.

00:18.175 --> 00:20.753
And that's everything you know today: your cellphone, anything.

00:20.866 --> 00:21.503
You program it.

00:21.822 --> 00:24.620
This is a whole generation of systems that they learn.

00:24.881 --> 00:25.675
And they just learn.

00:25.776 --> 00:26.793
You don't program them.
