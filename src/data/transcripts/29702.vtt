ï»¿I said, "Mom, I got news for you."

00:02.124 --> 00:04.405
And she said, "Well before your news, go get some milk."

00:04.662 --> 00:06.829
I said, "It's 10 o'clock in the night. Why should I get milk?"

00:07.167 --> 00:09.425
And I noticed that my husband's car was in the garage.

00:09.517 --> 00:11.105
I said, "Why don't you tell him to get the milk."

00:11.433 --> 00:12.555
She said, "Well, he came at 8:00."

00:12.645 --> 00:13.510
"He was very tired..."

00:13.717 --> 00:14.627
"...so I let him be."

00:14.926 --> 00:16.011
"Now you go get the milk."

00:16.141 --> 00:18.090
And you know, you never question your mom...

00:18.553 --> 00:19.502
...so I went and got the milk,...

00:19.612 --> 00:21.974
...came back, sort of banged it on the countertop and I said,...

00:22.201 --> 00:23.417
"I had big news for you."

00:23.504 --> 00:25.543
"I'd just been appointed president of PepsiCo..."

00:25.633 --> 00:27.284
"...and all that you care about is the milk."

00:28.013 --> 00:29.492
She just looked at me and she said,..

00:29.865 --> 00:30.780
"What are you talking about?"

00:30.859 --> 00:35.529
She said, "When you walk in that door, just leave that crown in the garage..."

00:35.641 --> 00:38.086
"...because you are the wife, the daughter,..."

00:38.175 --> 00:40.595
"...the daughter-in-law and the mother of the kids."

00:40.681 --> 00:42.184
"And that's all I want to talk about."
