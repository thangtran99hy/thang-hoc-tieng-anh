00:03.552 --> 00:05.664
Well, congratulations on being Teacher of the Year.

00:05.792 --> 00:06.780
Thank you so much.

00:06.955 --> 00:09.707
And I understand you teach science to very young kids.

00:09.830 --> 00:11.389
Yeah, my class is called STEAM Lab,...

00:11.507 --> 00:14.337
...science, technology, engineering, arts and math.

00:14.885 --> 00:18.177
I can talk to them about how all those different subjects integrate together...

00:18.288 --> 00:20.394
...and the skills that they use transfer across.

00:20.587 --> 00:24.379
At that young age, do you get all the kids pretty engaged?

00:24.461 --> 00:25.652
The boys and the girls?

00:25.753 --> 00:27.075
Oh yeah, definitely.

00:27.162 --> 00:30.487
I do projects in the arts and creative problem-solving,...

00:30.923 --> 00:33.199
...really working on developing those soft skills,...

00:33.309 --> 00:36.631
...you know, collaboration, creativity, critical thinking skills.

00:36.854 --> 00:38.909
Yeah, it's interesting you put art in there as well.

00:39.008 --> 00:44.129
Yeah, and I use it a lot to just talk to students about how it's that imagination,...

00:44.225 --> 00:46.883
...that creativity, the innovation side of their brain...

00:46.993 --> 00:49.725
...that they're always using no matter what else they're doing...

00:50.037 --> 00:53.251
...and those people who are going to be the most successful in the future...

00:53.341 --> 00:55.628
...are going to be people that have that lens on,...

00:55.713 --> 00:56.959
"Okay, how can I make this work better?"

00:57.031 --> 00:58.291
"How can I solve the problem?"

00:58.538 --> 01:00.079
Well, it's inspiring to hear what you're doing.

01:00.198 --> 01:01.667
Thanks so much for spending time with me.

01:01.739 --> 01:03.515
Thank you so much, I really appreciate it.
