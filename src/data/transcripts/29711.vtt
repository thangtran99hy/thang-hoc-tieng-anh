00:00.316 --> 00:03.863
Well, after a very chilly start to your Sunday, temperatures will warm up.

00:03.962 --> 00:05.775
We're gonna see lots of sunshine today,...

00:06.149 --> 00:09.260
...but dry conditions; it will be a very beautiful and pleasant day.

00:09.617 --> 00:13.307
But moisture levels will rapidly increase as we head into the workweek,...

00:13.499 --> 00:18.415
...so our humidity will come up Monday, Tuesday into Wednesday.

00:18.485 --> 00:19.517
So enjoy it while you can.

00:19.598 --> 00:21.600
And then the next front moves through on Thursday...

00:21.661 --> 00:24.450
...and our best chance for rain, Wednesday into Thursday.

00:24.729 --> 00:29.549
Highs today that will warm up nicely will be 78 in Seminole, 77 in St. Pete...

00:30.015 --> 00:32.498
...79 in Oldsmar, 79 in Tampa.

00:32.633 --> 00:36.244
Northern counties still warming up nicely too, Crystal River and Hernando,...

00:36.343 --> 00:41.795
...both at 77 and the rest of the bay area stays in the upper 70s.
