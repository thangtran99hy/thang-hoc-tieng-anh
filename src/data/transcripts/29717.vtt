And on pages, on social media like Facebook or Instagram and snapchat.

00:07.193 --> 00:10.682
People only post things that are happy,...

00:11.366 --> 00:17.991
...like eating food, which is what I post a lot, yeah...

00:18.687 --> 00:22.415
....or I just like traveling and this is how people see.

00:22.760 --> 00:26.234
You know, just me having fun and me climbing.

00:27.386 --> 00:30.931
But in reality, this is sort of what happens.

00:31.133 --> 00:34.157
Yeah, I hate it so much.

00:40.351 --> 00:43.841
From timing I've learned that like homework...

00:43.949 --> 00:48.460
...is sort of a part of 99% to success...

00:49.068 --> 00:54.605
...and I've learned that nothing worth doing is going to be easy.

00:55.171 --> 00:59.449
But the effort that you put into it, it's going to pay off at the end...

01:00.449 --> 01:06.091
...and I think that it's important to endure and climb through your problems.

01:06.593 --> 01:09.946
And well, failure is a huge part of success.

01:11.179 --> 01:16.244
And well, you don't have to be a rock climber to understand this.

01:16.529 --> 01:21.543
But I like to think that everyone in this room is a climber.

01:21.907 --> 01:29.284
Think about it, let's do a V14 because after all, we are all climbers at heart.

01:30.167 --> 01:30.629
Thank you.
