If you love spring flowers like daffodils and tulips,...

00:02.874 --> 00:06.667
...you need to plan and plant ahead because spring-blooming bulbs...

00:06.935 --> 00:08.402
...start with fall planting.

00:08.782 --> 00:11.779
The most popular type of spring bulbs include tulips,...

00:12.107 --> 00:16.756
...which come in a vivid array of colors like reds, yellows, oranges, purples and whites,...

00:17.161 --> 00:20.002
...and daffodils, also called narcissus,...

00:20.329 --> 00:22.823
...typically vary in colors of yellow and white,...

00:22.914 --> 00:24.525
...but there are also some peach varieties.

00:24.830 --> 00:28.024
They have that little cup in the middle surrounded by the frilly petals...

00:28.299 --> 00:29.619
...that everyone is so familiar with.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.282
The first step is to dig a hole.

00:32.674 --> 00:33.676
We've already got a hole here...

00:34.080 --> 00:36.968
...and the depth of our hole is determined by the size of the bulb.

00:37.216 --> 00:39.894
The general rule is three times as wide as the bulb...

00:40.135 --> 00:41.291
...is how deep you need to go.

00:41.761 --> 00:45.172
So, this particular bulb is about two inches, our hole is about six inches.

00:45.399 --> 00:47.067
And then you have to plant it right side up.

00:47.852 --> 00:52.146
You'll notice that the bottom of the bulb has some old ruffled roots on the bottom...

00:52.482 --> 00:54.294
...and the top of it will be more tapered.

00:54.754 --> 00:58.079
The next step is to sprinkle a little fertilizer in the bottom of the hole.

00:59.299 --> 01:01.842
Turn it all in; that way, the bulbs are fed...

01:02.203 --> 01:05.435
...and they have food and nutrition waiting at their roots right away.

01:05.951 --> 01:08.368
So you simply just place the bulbs in the hole.

01:10.009 --> 01:11.683
You want to make sure they aren't touching.

01:11.995 --> 01:15.485
So now I'm arranging them with the tops up and have them not touching.

01:15.815 --> 01:18.430
If you've got the space, you know, you can plant them by the hundreds.

01:18.706 --> 01:22.583
It really looks nice if you're working in an existing garden like we are here...

01:22.880 --> 01:24.512
...we put about 12 of them in this hole.

01:24.927 --> 01:26.565
You never want to plant one single bulb.

01:26.660 --> 01:28.939
I always plant them en masse to give you a big show.

01:29.337 --> 01:31.116
The next step is to cover them up with soil.

01:34.369 --> 01:36.491
After you water, now it's time to mulch.

01:36.959 --> 01:40.111
You simply spread about two inches of mulch over the top.

01:40.940 --> 01:43.381
You can actually go to four, two to four inches over the top...

01:43.738 --> 01:47.714
...and that helps keep the soil a consistent temperature all winter.
