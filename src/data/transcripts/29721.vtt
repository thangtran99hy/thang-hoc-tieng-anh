Today, let's learn how to pray at a shrine.

00:03.369 --> 00:06.507
First, let's ring the bell to greet the god.

00:09.327 --> 00:12.775
Second, throw a coin into the offering box.

00:12.990 --> 00:15.324
We usually use a five yen coin...

00:15.529 --> 00:19.132
...because in Japan, five yen is considered good fortune.

00:19.413 --> 00:24.348
Okay, now that you got god's attention, bow twice to show your respect...

00:25.043 --> 00:30.504
...and then clap your hands twice to express your joy of meeting with the god.

00:31.271 --> 00:34.379
Put your palms together and make the prayer.

00:37.717 --> 00:42.342
Finally, bow once again and you are now a proper prayer.

00:42.555 --> 00:43.255
Well done!
