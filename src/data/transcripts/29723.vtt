Before March 2011, I was a photographic retoucher based in New York City.

00:12.026 --> 00:13.685
We're pale, gray creatures.

00:13.779 --> 00:17.413
We hide in dark, windowless rooms and generally avoid sunlight.

00:18.165 --> 00:23.811
We make skinny models skinnier, perfect skin more perfect, and the impossible possible,...

00:25.001 --> 00:28.401
...and we get criticized in the press all the time,...

00:28.555 --> 00:33.644
...but some of us are actually talented artists with years of experience...

00:33.939 --> 00:37.140
...and a real appreciation for images and photography.

00:38.983 --> 00:43.525
On March 11, 2011, I watched from home, as the rest of the world did...

00:43.605 --> 00:46.093
...as the tragic events unfolded in Japan.

00:46.751 --> 00:51.781
Soon after, an organization I volunteer with, All Hands Volunteers, were on the ground...

00:51.929 --> 00:55.357
...within days, working as part of the response efforts.

00:56.149 --> 01:00.823
For weeks, all the volunteers and locals alike had been finding similar things.

01:00.909 --> 01:06.123
They'd been finding photos and photo albums and cameras and SD cards.

01:06.621 --> 01:07.797
Everyone was doing the same.

01:07.884 --> 01:08.815
They were collecting them up...

01:08.913 --> 01:13.135
...and handing them in to various places around the different towns for safekeeping.

01:14.037 --> 01:17.792
Now, it wasn't until this point that I realized that these photos...

01:17.865 --> 01:21.716
...were such a huge part of the personal loss these people had felt.

01:22.363 --> 01:24.944
As they had run from the wave and for their lives,...

01:25.282 --> 01:29.443
...absolutely everything they had, everything had to be left behind...

01:29.961 --> 01:32.605
...and I was honored that day that they actually trusted me...

01:32.693 --> 01:35.229
...to help them start hand-cleaning them.
