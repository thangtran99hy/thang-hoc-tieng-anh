Now, all these photos had been damaged by water, submerged in saltwater,...

00:04.845 --> 00:08.057
...covered in bacteria, in sewage, sometimes even oil,...

00:08.155 --> 00:11.081
...all of which, over time, is gonna continue to damage them,...

00:11.375 --> 00:14.185
...so hand-cleaning them was a huge part of the project.

00:14.477 --> 00:19.813
We couldn't retouch the photo unless it was clean, dry and reclaimed.

00:20.661 --> 00:22.572
Now, we were lucky with our hand-cleaning.

00:22.658 --> 00:25.673
We had an amazing local woman who guided us.

00:26.065 --> 00:30.071
It's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos.

00:31.081 --> 00:35.890
After six months in Japan, 1,100 volunteers had passed through All Hands,...

00:36.043 --> 00:40.823
...hundreds of whom had helped us hand-clean over 135,000 photographs.

00:42.003 --> 00:47.278
Over 500 volunteers around the globe helped us get 90 families'...

00:47.426 --> 00:50.936
...hundreds of photographs back, fully restored and retouched.

00:51.397 --> 00:55.109
During this time, we hadn't really spent more than about a thousand dollars...

00:55.193 --> 00:56.733
...in equipment and materials,...

00:57.358 --> 00:59.247
...most of which was printer inks.

01:00.574 --> 01:02.568
We take photos constantly.

01:02.990 --> 01:08.213
A photo is a reminder of someone or something, a place, a relationship, a loved one.

01:08.832 --> 01:11.199
They're our memory keepers in our histories,...

01:11.655 --> 01:15.630
...the last thing we would grab and the first thing you'd go back to look for.

01:16.414 --> 01:18.191
That's what this project was about,...

01:18.534 --> 01:23.561
...about restoring those little bits of humanity, giving someone that connection back.
