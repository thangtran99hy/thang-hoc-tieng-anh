ï»¿There are inherent differences in how men's and women's brains are wired and how they think.

00:05.137 --> 00:09.547
I'm talking about animal research, brain imaging studies and cross-cultural surveys.

00:09.781 --> 00:13.303
One tidbit from the article focused on a group of 34 rhesus monkeys.

00:13.613 --> 00:16.704
Males liked toys with wheels instead of plush toys.

00:16.903 --> 00:18.773
The females preferred the plush kind.

00:19.097 --> 00:22.402
Same thing for human boys and girls on the 9 to 17 month range,...

00:22.500 --> 00:26.307
...preferring stereotypically male versus stereotypically female toys.

00:26.611 --> 00:30.790
Another study showed infant girls respond more to faces and start talking earlier.

00:31.019 --> 00:34.474
And later in life, men are focused on things, women to faces.

00:34.759 --> 00:39.657
Finally, navigation studies in humans and rats show females often rely on landmarks...

00:39.794 --> 00:43.814
...while males calculate their position by estimating the direction and distance.
