ï»¿Planet Earth.

00:05.223 --> 00:05.378
Yup.

00:06.433 --> 00:08.065
Life here is getting better.

00:11.575 --> 00:15.892
Medicines and education are reaching ever greater numbers of people.

00:19.181 --> 00:24.793
Across continents, people are sharing more ideas, solving more problems...

00:25.435 --> 00:26.957
...and living longer lives.

00:30.469 --> 00:33.556
Big businesses and small are crossing more borders,...

00:34.067 --> 00:39.347
...bringing opportunity, prosperity and optimism into people's lives.

00:40.481 --> 00:43.086
This is the power of global trade.

00:44.777 --> 00:46.629
Of course, there's still a long way to go...

00:47.512 --> 00:49.500
...but the more the world keeps on trading,...

00:50.133 --> 00:53.301
...the better it's going to get for everyone, everywhere.

00:54.169 --> 00:58.133
That's why we'll deliver today, tomorrow and the day after.
