00:04.047 --> 00:06.999
When the world drifts away from our eyes.

00:08.040 --> 00:10.819
Say, on one of a thousand nights.

00:11.895 --> 00:14.969
There begins a dream within a dream.

00:16.146 --> 00:21.109
I watch you with a hundred thousand eyes, Istanbul.

00:21.650 --> 00:25.855
My leaves flutter and beat like a hundred thousand hearts.

00:28.359 --> 00:30.984
The wisteria vine in full blossom.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.577
Fruit reddening on the bough.

00:34.827 --> 00:35.705
I'm local.

00:36.355 --> 00:38.899
Like a slice of Trabzon cheese.

00:39.864 --> 00:41.463
A tuft of mohair.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.363
A pinch of rye.

00:43.988 --> 00:45.639
A handful of Sile cotton.

00:46.735 --> 00:49.685
I recalled Borges's dreamlike tale.

00:50.763 --> 00:53.499
One morning by the Aegean.

00:54.873 --> 00:56.491
See there on the shores.

00:56.995 --> 00:59.789
One by one, waves start blue.

01:00.618 --> 01:03.115
Then spread purple across the seas.

01:05.757 --> 01:08.241
Facing the sea of sparkling waves.

01:08.747 --> 01:10.875
Laid-back in knee-deep waters.

01:13.123 --> 01:16.853
I smile at you all in good will.
