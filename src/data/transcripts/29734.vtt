00:00.703 --> 00:02.159
ï»¿This is America.

00:03.157 --> 00:04.969
And this is the top one percent.

00:05.680 --> 00:10.138
We're going to talk about how much money this guy makes and how we tax him.

00:10.927 --> 00:12.230
Back to our blue friend here.

00:12.915 --> 00:15.613
Maybe he's a doctor, maybe he's a hedge fund manager.

00:15.965 --> 00:18.133
Maybe he's a professional athlete or a CEO.

00:18.471 --> 00:22.197
And then there's the rest of the population, broken down into five groups.

00:22.823 --> 00:25.373
Okay, these 1,000 M&Ms...

00:25.471 --> 00:28.885
...represent all of the personal income in the United States this year.

00:29.565 --> 00:33.243
Using estimates from the Tax Policy Center, here's how U.S. income shakes out.

00:33.706 --> 00:40.943
The blue guy and others in the top 1% take home 15.3% of income or 153 of these M&Ms,...

00:41.391 --> 00:43.583
...so it's obvious Mr. Blue is rich.
