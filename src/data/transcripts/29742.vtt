ï»¿There's lots of ways to be as a person,...

00:12.787 --> 00:19.611
...and some people express their deep appreciation in different ways.

00:22.502 --> 00:29.882
But one of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity...

00:30.493 --> 00:34.297
...is to make something wonderful and put it out there.

00:35.658 --> 00:40.220
And you never meet the people, you never shake their hands,...

00:40.983 --> 00:43.035
...you never hear their story or tell yours.

00:43.164 --> 00:48.718
But somehow, in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love,...

00:49.103 --> 00:51.034
...something's transmitted there.

00:53.329 --> 01:01.267
And it's a way of expressing to the rest of our species our deep appreciation.

01:02.946 --> 01:07.231
So, we need to be true to who we are.

01:08.294 --> 01:11.123
And remember what's really important to us.

01:12.337 --> 01:14.516
That's what's going to keep Apple, Apple:...

01:15.340 --> 01:17.395
...is if we keep us, us.
