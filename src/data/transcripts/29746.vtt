ï»¿This is Google Home.

00:01.631 --> 00:04.731
It's not a phone like, it doesn't have buttons or a screen...

00:04.946 --> 00:07.541
...but you can use it to make phone calls to pretty much anyone.

00:07.871 --> 00:10.138
So, you can ask it to call your mom or call your brother...

00:10.272 --> 00:13.639
...or you can be like, "Hey Google, call that sandwich shop on Pierce Street."

00:13.736 --> 00:14.431
And it'll be like,...

00:14.635 --> 00:16.331
"Okay, calling Gino's."

00:18.349 --> 00:19.099
Gino's Deli.

00:19.269 --> 00:19.544
See?

00:19.634 --> 00:20.732
And you get Gino's on the phone.

00:20.891 --> 00:23.318
Lady, you gotta stop doing this unless you're gonna order something.

00:23.421 --> 00:24.228
No, I get it.

00:24.429 --> 00:24.543
That's fair.

00:25.227 --> 00:25.419
That's fair.
