His name is Christopher Robin, but we generally call him Billy.

00:07.891 --> 00:08.487
A toast.

00:09.223 --> 00:10.846
C. R. Milne.

00:11.038 --> 00:12.003
C. R. Milne.

00:12.737 --> 00:15.095
It helped us to believe in the good things.

00:15.246 --> 00:15.959
Which one would you like?

00:16.992 --> 00:18.292
This one.

00:18.385 --> 00:19.268
They're the same height, Billy.

00:20.163 --> 00:20.339
Go!

00:22.006 --> 00:23.020
The fun things.

00:23.577 --> 00:24.505
Who's your favorite?

00:24.783 --> 00:26.163
I'll have to go for the middle one.

00:26.501 --> 00:26.859
Piglet.

00:27.238 --> 00:27.989
It has to be Piglet.

00:28.539 --> 00:30.557
And a world full of imagination.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.523
Are you writing a book?

00:42.781 --> 00:44.033
I thought we were just having fun.

00:44.303 --> 00:46.369
We're writing a book and we're having fun.

00:48.143 --> 00:55.305
And then, just like a tap you turned on, happiness came pouring out.
