00:01.697 --> 00:02.873
ï»¿This is a terrible loss.

00:04.600 --> 00:06.487
I just wanted to say how truly sorry I am.

00:06.784 --> 00:07.797
How did you know Gordon?

00:08.054 --> 00:08.865
He saved my life.

00:09.468 --> 00:12.803
He was found dead in his office with gunshots in the wall.

00:12.913 --> 00:13.712
Gunshots?

00:13.867 --> 00:14.860
No bullet wounds.

00:14.959 --> 00:17.019
He was working with a lot of troubled people.

00:17.944 --> 00:19.880
We need to find out what happened to you, Gordon.

00:20.349 --> 00:21.529
It's the least I can do.

00:22.644 --> 00:27.145
I can't see your memories, but I can see the memories of those near you.

00:28.604 --> 00:29.172
Who are you?

00:29.381 --> 00:30.713
I'm working for his widow.

00:30.943 --> 00:32.073
I knew you saw him that night.

00:32.327 --> 00:33.091
I loved him.

00:36.594 --> 00:37.339
Can I help you?

00:37.471 --> 00:38.343
Yes. Alison?

00:38.586 --> 00:39.687
Alison is dead.

00:42.027 --> 00:43.072
You think they're hiding something?

00:43.230 --> 00:44.402
There are people looking for you.

00:44.743 --> 00:47.553
A man has been murdered, I got bigger things to worry about.

00:48.854 --> 00:51.011
Word cannot get out about Gordon's death.

00:51.814 --> 00:52.866
What do you want from me?

00:52.995 --> 00:54.366
I wanted to ask you questions about Gordon Dunn.

00:54.634 --> 00:55.154
Get out!

00:55.448 --> 00:58.557
The mind forgets things for a reason.

00:58.661 --> 01:00.323
There are adverse effects in the machine.

01:00.453 --> 01:01.805
Time collapse, hallucinations.

01:02.353 --> 01:03.637
Do you know who this is?

01:03.748 --> 01:04.831
Lawton has been lying.

01:06.244 --> 01:07.971
I think I know who killed Gordon.

01:08.756 --> 01:10.837
I would hate it if I found out that you were lying.

01:12.267 --> 01:13.888
You have something you wish you could forget?

01:14.276 --> 01:14.981
Who are you?

01:15.094 --> 01:15.658
Put it down.

01:15.875 --> 01:16.744
Put it down!

01:17.765 --> 01:19.368
Help me!
