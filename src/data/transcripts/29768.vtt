ï»¿My name is Auggie Pullman.

00:01.959 --> 00:03.843
Next week, I start 5th grade.

00:04.561 --> 00:09.611
And since I've never been to a real school before, I'm pretty much totally petrified.

00:10.761 --> 00:11.417
I'll see you later.

00:12.447 --> 00:14.999
You don't want to walk up with your parents because it's not cool.

00:15.230 --> 00:15.852
But you're cool.

00:15.933 --> 00:20.861
I know I am but technically, most dads aren't and neither are these helmets.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.817
Dear God, please make them be nice to him.

00:24.241 --> 00:24.513
Hi!

00:24.807 --> 00:26.011
You don't have to do this.

00:26.170 --> 00:27.472
I don't know what you're talking about, Auggie.

00:27.541 --> 00:29.145
You don't have to pretend is all I'm saying.

00:29.258 --> 00:29.771
Auggie!

00:29.869 --> 00:31.018
Okay, I'm really sorry.

00:31.331 --> 00:32.445
Why are you sitting here then?

00:32.720 --> 00:34.459
Because I want some nice friends for a change.

00:34.725 --> 00:35.159
Me too.

00:35.790 --> 00:37.567
Who is it that I aspire to be?

00:37.895 --> 00:40.522
That is the question that we should be asking ourselves all the time.

00:40.651 --> 00:41.956
Hey Jack, come sit here.

00:42.564 --> 00:43.053
In a sec.

00:45.742 --> 00:47.727
You haven't thought about having plastic surgery?

00:48.098 --> 00:50.290
Dude,  this is after plastic surgery.

00:50.659 --> 00:52.583
It takes a lot of work to look this good.
