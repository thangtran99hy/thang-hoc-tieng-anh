00:03.064 --> 00:05.422
I'm Inspector Kildare of Scotland Yard.

00:06.264 --> 00:08.316
I'm investigating a series of deaths.

00:08.561 --> 00:11.222
They're calling them the Limehouse Golem murders.

00:13.783 --> 00:16.073
At Ratcliff highway, he slaughtered a household.

00:16.372 --> 00:17.922
The previous week, a prostitute.

00:19.059 --> 00:20.310
The Golem is a madman.

00:21.371 --> 00:23.471
Even madness has its own logic.

00:25.697 --> 00:29.274
Inspector Kildare, I may have found an eyewitness in Limehouse, Sir.

00:30.121 --> 00:31.235
I can't tell you what I know.

00:31.541 --> 00:34.732
Just assist me, I promise I won't let anything happen to you.

00:37.542 --> 00:39.172
Who was here on September 24th?

00:39.948 --> 00:41.079
There were four men that day:...

00:42.063 --> 00:47.029
...John Cree, Dan Leno, George Gissing, Karl Marx.

00:48.532 --> 00:50.373
The newspaper said it was your first murder case.

00:51.410 --> 00:53.235
The Yard is setting me up as a scapegoat.

00:54.659 --> 00:55.916
The public want blood.

00:57.349 --> 00:58.395
The Golem provides it.

01:01.448 --> 01:06.885
He who observes spills no less blood than he who inflicts the blow.

01:08.204 --> 01:08.842
It's a message...

01:10.203 --> 01:10.708
...to us.
