00:00.975 --> 00:01.172
Help!

00:02.782 --> 00:03.933
You never know you're a mutant...

00:03.999 --> 00:04.617
Help me!

00:06.934 --> 00:07.340
What is that?

00:08.727 --> 00:10.146
...until it happens the first time.

00:13.151 --> 00:13.304
Run!

00:13.367 --> 00:14.455
I need to find my brother!

00:14.729 --> 00:16.973
On this day, everything changes...

00:17.076 --> 00:18.065
Jessie!

00:18.261 --> 00:18.657
...forever.

00:24.543 --> 00:26.593
This is the story of two families...

00:26.892 --> 00:27.381
This is everyone?

00:27.883 --> 00:28.642
Yeah, we're all here.

00:28.969 --> 00:30.737
...who came together to protect each other.

00:32.160 --> 00:32.607
Cops,...

00:32.683 --> 00:33.711
...headed fast this way.

00:37.201 --> 00:38.379
Not the ones with resources,...

00:42.591 --> 00:43.775
...but the ones in the shadows,...

00:45.051 --> 00:45.849
...fighting to hide,...

00:50.267 --> 00:50.913
...to escape,...

00:57.054 --> 00:57.990
...to survive.

00:59.181 --> 01:01.257
This is our story.

01:03.572 --> 01:04.113
Go, now!

01:07.391 --> 01:11.123
This is a burden, yes, but it's also a gift.
