Of the seven billion people on Earth, roughly six billion own a cellphone,...

00:04.301 --> 00:09.366
...which is pretty shocking, given that only four and a half billion have access to a working toilet.

00:09.811 --> 00:12.627
So, how are these popular gadgets changing your body and brain?

00:12.991 --> 00:15.121
If you're looking down at your phone right now,...

00:15.219 --> 00:19.323
...your spine angle is equivalent to that of an 8-year-old child sitting on your neck,...

00:19.770 --> 00:24.853
...which is fairly significant considering people spend an average of 4.7 hours a day...

00:24.937 --> 00:26.083
...looking at their phone.

00:26.443 --> 00:29.445
This, combined with the length of time spent in front of computers,...

00:29.731 --> 00:34.067
...has led to an increase in the prevalence of myopia or nearsightedness in North America.

00:34.376 --> 00:39.721
In the 1970s, about one-quarter of the population had myopia, where today nearly half do.

00:39.893 --> 00:44.382
And in some parts of Asia, 80 to 90% of the population is now nearsighted.

00:44.511 --> 00:46.616
Your smartphone can also disrupt your sleep.

00:46.969 --> 00:50.404
The screen emits a blue light which has been shown to alter our circadian rhythms,...

00:50.502 --> 00:52.505
...diminishing the time spent in deep sleep,...

00:52.803 --> 00:56.313
...which is linked to the development of diabetes, cancer and obesity.

00:56.781 --> 00:59.371
Studies have shown that people who read on their smartphone at night...

00:59.601 --> 01:02.854
...have a harder time falling asleep and produce less melatonin,...

01:03.083 --> 01:06.295
...a hormone responsible for the regulation of sleep-wake cycles.

01:06.802 --> 01:11.124
Harvard medical school advises the last two to three hours before bed be "technology-free".

01:11.431 --> 01:13.305
So, pick up a book before bed instead.
