So he's had a couple of flops, well, who hasn't?

00:03.473 --> 00:04.547
You have a new book in mind?

00:05.921 --> 00:06.651
Of course he does!

00:07.551 --> 00:09.642
My lamp's gone out, I've ran out of ideas.

00:09.798 --> 00:10.487
Are we in trouble?

00:10.615 --> 00:11.279
No, of course not.

00:14.226 --> 00:16.675
I have told you not to disturb me when I am working.

00:18.712 --> 00:21.867
On Christmas Eve, the spirits pour into the night.

00:23.337 --> 00:26.407
Well here, Mr. Dickens, pickpockets, streetwalkers, humbug...

00:26.615 --> 00:28.286
Those people don't belong in books.

00:28.937 --> 00:29.287
Charles...

00:29.355 --> 00:29.823
Humbug!

00:32.795 --> 00:37.125
How do you make a world come alive, I could almost see and hear them people?

00:38.969 --> 00:42.188
Even if you've already written it, we couldn't possibly get it printed and distributed...

00:42.315 --> 00:44.036
...in only six weeks.

00:44.317 --> 00:46.243
If I can't finish it, I'll never write again.

00:47.417 --> 00:49.035
The characters won't do what I want.

00:49.992 --> 00:50.907
I'm the author here.

00:51.131 --> 00:51.883
Allegedly.

00:53.375 --> 00:54.521
A jolly ghost?

00:54.727 --> 00:55.709
What's that mean?

00:59.449 --> 01:02.863
This season of hope, we will shut out nothing and everyone will be welcome.

01:07.908 --> 01:09.229
I have to get to the printers by nine o'clock.

01:09.586 --> 01:10.921
But you still don't have an ending.

01:12.119 --> 01:14.907
Merry, merry Christmas to one and all.

01:15.708 --> 01:17.221
Merry Christmas!
