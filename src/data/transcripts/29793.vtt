Life is busy enough without all the added push notifications.

00:08.316 --> 00:10.618
Oh, come on Instagram, I'm late for work.

00:11.076 --> 00:18.549
Almost every app is grasping to pull us out of the real world and into the digital one.

00:21.205 --> 00:24.035
Breaking news, Facebook, breaking news.

00:24.480 --> 00:26.066
They bug us everywhere.

00:26.301 --> 00:27.931
And I mean everywhere.

00:29.559 --> 00:31.790
And they bug us about everything...

00:32.074 --> 00:33.139
Oh, come on!

00:33.299 --> 00:34.919
...and anything.

00:39.033 --> 00:41.167
Seriously, anything.

00:47.575 --> 00:49.197
Oh, this is important.

00:50.083 --> 00:53.127
And that right there is the biggest problem with push notifications.

00:53.239 --> 00:57.369
It's very hard to find the important ones in a sea of unimportant ones.
