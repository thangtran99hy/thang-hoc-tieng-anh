ï»¿Time to say goodbye to the Google Drive app.

00:03.494 --> 00:06.987
Google announced the backup program has three months to live.

00:07.157 --> 00:10.045
But don't panic, it's actually not that big of a deal.

00:10.325 --> 00:14.547
You see, the whole cloud storage space known as Google Drive, that's still alive.

00:14.797 --> 00:17.967
What is going away is the app called Google Drive.

00:18.243 --> 00:21.173
And that's used to back up your computer's files to the cloud.

00:21.302 --> 00:23.343
The naming of it is all a bit messy.

00:23.631 --> 00:27.869
Google Drive, the app, is being replaced by a program called Backup and Sync.

00:27.955 --> 00:29.660
Now, this new program is pretty handy.

00:29.983 --> 00:33.662
You tell it which folders on your computer you want to sync to the cloud,...

00:33.811 --> 00:38.715
...even make all your photos and videos automatically back up to the Google Photos library.

00:39.117 --> 00:41.087
So, you could use this to have important folders...

00:41.166 --> 00:43.517
...to be continuously backed up to your Drive account.

00:43.827 --> 00:47.231
But that means you will quickly exceed the 15 GBs of free space...

00:47.315 --> 00:48.937
...and you'll need to pay for more.
