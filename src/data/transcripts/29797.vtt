I know so many people who say "I work in finance,...

00:03.475 --> 00:06.177
...but I really, kind of, want to make sculptures",...

00:06.289 --> 00:10.960
...or "I am a doctor, but my passion has been playing guitar on the weekends."

00:11.447 --> 00:14.011
And I know so many people who are so talented,...

00:14.438 --> 00:16.273
...who gave up to live a more conventional life...

00:16.452 --> 00:20.232
...because of the fear and the doubts of what was possible.

00:25.904 --> 00:32.361
Too many people let their fears and their doubt of what's possible derail them.

00:32.671 --> 00:35.220
They were looking for jobs, they were looking to be hired.

00:35.320 --> 00:37.953
I'm not looking for jobs, I'm not looking to be hired.

00:41.526 --> 00:46.348
There is no freedom in security, but there's security in freedom.

00:47.241 --> 00:48.955
Someone told me that many many years ago.

00:49.325 --> 00:54.431
So for me, I chased freedom and I have security because I feel free.
