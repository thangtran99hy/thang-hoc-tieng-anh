ï»¿Cora?

00:03.255 --> 00:05.552
Oh my gosh, look at you!

00:05.878 --> 00:07.915
What does your mom think about you coming to stay?

00:08.131 --> 00:09.040
She thinks it's a great idea.

00:10.993 --> 00:11.371
Sup?

00:11.719 --> 00:14.150
Cora, this is Chicka and this is Tom.

00:14.470 --> 00:14.882
How are you doing?

00:17.601 --> 00:18.300
Come on!

00:19.438 --> 00:21.169
When was the last time you went swimming?

00:21.353 --> 00:22.081
In the ocean?

00:24.796 --> 00:29.115
I missed most of my childhood so I could be where you wanted me.

00:30.161 --> 00:34.727
I fit into your life and now I'm doing something on my own terms.

00:35.778 --> 00:37.399
Cora, you can't just always run away.

00:37.514 --> 00:38.929
I am not running away!

00:40.243 --> 00:42.789
I am running towards something else,...

00:46.207 --> 00:47.362
...something on my own terms.

00:48.097 --> 00:48.823
These are really good.

00:49.753 --> 00:50.126
Thank you.

00:51.003 --> 00:53.412
Our family makes strong women and you're one of them.

00:54.007 --> 00:54.771
Be proud of that.

01:05.941 --> 01:08.463
Open your eyes and go, Cora, go!

01:12.150 --> 01:15.620
Things happen and they change us and we can't control them.

01:16.924 --> 01:19.381
What you can control is how they change you.
