ï»¿Imagine a place at the end of the world.

00:13.496 --> 00:18.187
Imagine a little paradise full of tremendous landscapes.

00:23.449 --> 00:27.703
Imagine feeling like the whole world is all yours.

00:29.912 --> 00:30.713
Breathe deeply.

00:32.644 --> 00:35.241
Then let your breath be taken away.

00:41.407 --> 00:44.149
Now, imagine the people who live here.

00:44.575 --> 00:49.385
People with stories with their hearts and arms wide open.

00:49.845 --> 00:54.560
Chile is just like its people, just like its landscapes.

00:56.567 --> 00:59.077
Chile is open nature.
