ï»¿I am here at the University of Sydney where the mechanical engineering shop...

00:05.379 --> 00:08.006
...has built this incredible piece of apparatus for me.

00:08.227 --> 00:13.266
It is a 40-pound, that is 19-kilogram, flywheel on the end of a meter-long shaft.

00:13.764 --> 00:18.601
Can you imagine trying to hold this out horizontally with just one hand at this end?

00:19.353 --> 00:23.607
It is virtually... It is impossible, okay?

00:23.872 --> 00:27.326
Let's prove that I could lift it, just this end, without it spinning.

00:27.572 --> 00:28.006
Here we go.

00:31.659 --> 00:33.343
I mean, it's just kind of awkward with the hand.

00:35.698 --> 00:36.191
Careful!

00:42.323 --> 00:43.300
Just barely.

00:44.093 --> 00:45.727
Oh goodness, do you even lift?

00:47.171 --> 00:47.964
Clearly I do not.

00:48.167 --> 00:50.972
Undaunted by my lack of strength, I'm going for it.

00:51.498 --> 00:54.457
But I want to make sure that the wheel is spinning as fast as possible...

00:54.533 --> 00:56.588
...to give me the best chance of success.

00:57.190 --> 01:00.385
Now, I am going to release my left hand...

01:01.147 --> 01:03.339
...and, holding only with my right hand at the end of the shaft,...

01:03.993 --> 01:05.833
...I'll try to lift it up over my head.

01:07.691 --> 01:10.969
This is a 40-pound, 19-kilogram flywheel.

01:11.509 --> 01:11.883
Ready?

01:12.708 --> 01:14.724
Here we go: three, two, one.

01:19.108 --> 01:19.745
Beautiful!
