ï»¿One of my favorite magicians is Karl Germain.

00:07.008 --> 00:08.602
He had this wonderful trick...

00:08.718 --> 00:13.064
...where a rosebush would bloom right in front of your eyes.

00:13.867 --> 00:18.845
But it was his production of a butterfly that was the most beautiful.

00:19.061 --> 00:24.522
"Ladies and gentlemen, the creation of life."

00:30.095 --> 00:33.649
When asked about deception, he said this:...

00:35.347 --> 00:38.331
"Magic is the only honest profession."

00:38.899 --> 00:42.874
"A magician promises to deceive you and he does."

00:43.027 --> 00:45.794
I like to think of myself as an honest magician.

00:46.467 --> 00:52.051
I use a lot of tricks, which means that sometimes I have to lie to you.

00:52.973 --> 00:55.571
Now, I feel bad about that.

00:56.013 --> 00:58.811
But people lie every day.

00:59.593 --> 01:00.468
Hold on.

01:00.678 --> 01:01.935
Hey, where are you?

01:02.199 --> 01:03.410
I'm stuck in traffic.

01:03.554 --> 01:04.705
I'll be there soon.

01:05.431 --> 01:06.327
You've all done it.

01:09.445 --> 01:11.566
I'll be ready in just a minute, darling.

01:11.783 --> 01:14.736
It's just what I've always wanted.

01:14.974 --> 01:16.576
You look great!

01:16.909 --> 01:22.122
Deception, it's a fundamental part of life.
