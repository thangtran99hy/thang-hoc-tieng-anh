This week, Japanese game publisher Bandai Namco...

00:04.873 --> 00:07.476
...is opening its new VR Zone here in Shinjuku, Tokyo.

00:08.083 --> 00:10.351
Unlike its previous six-month temporary site in Odaiba,...

00:10.765 --> 00:12.794
...VR Zone Shinjuku will operate for two years...

00:13.191 --> 00:16.756
...and is expected to serve five to seven times as many people daily.

00:17.888 --> 00:19.588
Ahead of the official launch on Friday,...

00:19.983 --> 00:22.435
...I got to preview some of the 12 VR games there.

00:22.952 --> 00:26.099
Most notably, there's Mario Kart VR, which is a multiplayer game...

00:26.196 --> 00:28.315
...linking up to a maximum of four rides...

00:28.676 --> 00:32.041
...and you get to play as either Mario, Luigi, Peach or Yoshi.

00:32.555 --> 00:35.945
It's very much like the classic game, but strictly in first person view...

00:36.420 --> 00:38.848
...and you do have to reach out to grab and throw your weapon.

00:39.287 --> 00:42.017
It can be either a banana, a shell or a hammer.

00:42.594 --> 00:46.555
This was easily my favorite game and I'm sure many people will feel the same way.

00:49.154 --> 00:50.893
Oh yeah!

00:51.343 --> 00:54.233
Another highly anticipated game though is Dragon Ball VR...

00:54.587 --> 00:57.304
...in which you get to learn how to make your own Kamehameha...

00:57.619 --> 00:59.585
...so that you can fight the person in the other booth.

01:00.258 --> 01:03.195
I was greeted by Goku, who gave me step-by-step instructions,...

01:03.524 --> 01:05.207
...and after destroying a few large rocks,...

01:05.467 --> 01:07.992
...I was teleported to the battlefield to face my enemy.

01:08.565 --> 01:12.321
I loved how the platform and the gloves vibrated while I was generating Kamehameha...

01:12.805 --> 01:16.003
...and as a bonus, the platform also blew a breeze in front of me.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.843
Hopefully, we'll get to go Super Saiyan in the future release of this game.
