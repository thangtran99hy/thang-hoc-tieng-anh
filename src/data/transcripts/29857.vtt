Hello, James speaking.

00:02.489 --> 00:03.666
Oh hi, it's Graham Burn here.

00:03.754 --> 00:04.352
Is that James?

00:04.815 --> 00:05.238
Yes.

00:05.359 --> 00:08.349
Great, it's Graham here, I'm calling from Kells and Co.

00:08.453 --> 00:09.289
We're an accounting firm.

00:09.393 --> 00:12.587
I've just come out of an interview with a friend of yours, Tim Barnard...

00:12.927 --> 00:13.930
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

00:15.007 --> 00:16.363
...who looked to be a great candidate,...

00:16.465 --> 00:20.409
...so we thought we'd make our way back through the references quite promptly.

00:21.107 --> 00:21.657
You know Tim?

00:22.229 --> 00:23.390
Yeah, I know Tim personally.

00:23.479 --> 00:24.990
I've known him for a few years now.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.073
How long have you known Tim?

00:26.703 --> 00:30.393
I've known Tim from probably ten years.

00:30.655 --> 00:32.101
How did you guys become friends?

00:32.475 --> 00:33.695
Through footy, the footy club.

00:34.108 --> 00:35.630
Right, fantastic.

00:35.716 --> 00:37.675
He didn't strike me as a footy player.

00:38.509 --> 00:43.979
He wasn't really a player, he was just more come in as a spectator sort of thing.

00:44.086 --> 00:45.315
Oh yes, helping out around the club.

00:45.529 --> 00:46.471
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46.815 --> 00:47.728
Okay, fantastic.

00:48.186 --> 00:50.923
He'll be dealing with higher-end companies...

00:51.025 --> 00:54.355
...in his role, businesses, of profits of a million dollars plus.

00:54.913 --> 00:56.299
Is he known to be good with money?

00:56.393 --> 00:57.371
Do you know anything about that?

00:58.292 --> 01:02.539
From my understanding, he helped out a lot with a few fundraisers and stuff like that.

01:03.032 --> 01:03.347
Yep.

01:04.226 --> 01:05.431
So yeah, as far as I know.

01:06.535 --> 01:08.814
Any other examples of him taking on responsibility?

01:09.579 --> 01:10.947
He helps out the treasurer a lot.

01:11.869 --> 01:12.517
Oh, that's good.

01:14.187 --> 01:15.945
And he does that a fair bit.
