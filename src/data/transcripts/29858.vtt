ï»¿Welcome to Jurassic Warehouse.

00:14.202 --> 00:15.441
This is Stegosaur.

00:15.581 --> 00:19.056
Stegosaur is for a Jurassic World exhibition.

00:19.634 --> 00:21.227
This is our T-Rex.

00:21.306 --> 00:23.652
She tends to steal the show and dominate the workshop.

00:24.216 --> 00:26.109
I keep thinking one of these things is gonna eat me.

00:26.205 --> 00:26.635
Yeah.

00:28.827 --> 00:33.174
Sonny Tilders hails from Melbourne and cofounded Creature Technology.

00:33.921 --> 00:40.899
Since its birth in 2006, the company has specialized in making giant robotic animals...

00:41.203 --> 00:44.975
...and has ended up as one of the biggest animatronics companies around.

00:47.443 --> 00:51.046
The creature team is made up of movie special effects artists...

00:51.271 --> 00:53.430
...who needed work during down periods...

00:54.297 --> 00:58.342
...and their first project was a live show called Walking with Dinosaurs...

00:58.586 --> 01:03.304
...that ended up as the highest-grossing touring event in the world in 2010.

01:04.547 --> 01:06.447
They've been in high demand ever since,...

01:06.995 --> 01:12.956
...making rideable dragons, a full-sized King Kong and cuddlier creations...

01:13.093 --> 01:16.727
...like these giant stuffed animals for the Sochi Olympics.

01:17.021 --> 01:20.655
Vladimir Putin still likes to cuddle the bunny rabbit on the right.
