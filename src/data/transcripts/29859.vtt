00:02.693 --> 00:09.169
The mysterious life of developers has been incomprehensible for a long time...

00:09.884 --> 00:10.747
...until now.

00:13.919 --> 00:17.513
This is one of the most common species of developer.

00:18.203 --> 00:23.982
This is the "cliche developer" which can be spotted by the conference t-shirt...

00:24.443 --> 00:25.689
...and the pale skin.

00:26.401 --> 00:30.864
The main source of nutrition is a black carbonated liquid,...

00:31.252 --> 00:33.893
...which is devoured in a large quantity.

00:35.065 --> 00:38.938
This separates him from the more rare "hipster developer"...

00:39.465 --> 00:40.445
...observed here.

00:41.649 --> 00:47.716
This species only drinks warm liquids based on expensive spices and beans...

00:48.175 --> 00:51.628
...and his only tool is a so-called Macintosh.

00:52.061 --> 00:56.980
The hipster developer will often refuse to work with tasks...

00:57.136 --> 01:00.846
...such as SQL databases or Java.

01:01.407 --> 01:05.769
Notice how this specimen also makes use of the trackpad...

01:06.299 --> 01:08.668
...attached to his portable Macintosh.

01:09.582 --> 01:13.843
For many individuals in the herd, it is considered prestigious...

01:14.103 --> 01:16.605
...to not utilize this unit at all.

01:17.832 --> 01:22.241
The herd all work together towards a common goal,...

01:22.641 --> 01:25.479
...a goal set by the project owner.
