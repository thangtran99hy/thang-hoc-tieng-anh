Four years ago, we started to wonder.

00:06.392 --> 00:09.231
What would shopping look like if you could walk into a store...

00:09.777 --> 00:12.034
...grab what you want and just go?

00:13.219 --> 00:17.183
What if we can weave the most advanced machine learning, computer vision and AI...

00:17.366 --> 00:20.875
...into the very fabric of a store so you never have to wait in line?

00:21.847 --> 00:25.043
No lines, no checkouts, no registers.

00:27.705 --> 00:29.845
Welcome to Amazon Go.

00:31.455 --> 00:33.388
Use the Amazon Go app to enter.

00:34.636 --> 00:36.925
Then put away your phone and start shopping.

00:38.581 --> 00:39.780
So, how does it work?

00:41.266 --> 00:45.143
We use computer vision, deep learning algorithms, and sensor fusion,...

00:45.547 --> 00:47.841
...much like you'd find in self-driving cars.

00:48.420 --> 00:50.660
We call it "Just walk out" technology.

00:53.213 --> 00:56.124
Once you've got everything you want, you can just go.

00:57.255 --> 01:00.714
When you leave, our "Just Walk Out" technology adds up your virtual cart...

01:00.869 --> 01:02.200
....and charges your Amazon account.

01:02.649 --> 01:06.067
Your receipt is sent straight to the app and you can keep going.

01:07.043 --> 01:07.932
Amazon Go.

01:09.991 --> 01:10.699
No lines.

01:10.906 --> 01:11.543
No checkout.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.169
No, seriously.
