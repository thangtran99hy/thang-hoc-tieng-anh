Tucked inside this silver paper is the world's most expensive chocolate bar,...

00:09.182 --> 00:15.335
...priced at an indulgent 345 dollars for less than two ounces.

00:15.757 --> 00:18.704
Jerry Toth is a cofounder of To'ak Chocolate.

00:19.120 --> 00:24.315
His bars are made with a cacao called nacional, found in the rainforests of Ecuador.

00:25.591 --> 00:30.728
The bean is so rare, it was thought to be extinct until just a few years ago.

00:31.035 --> 00:34.257
It's known for its floral aroma and complex flavors.

00:34.899 --> 00:38.748
Once harvested, the seeds are fermented in Spanish elmwood,...

00:39.391 --> 00:43.936
...dried and only the best ones are hand-selected for the pricey confection.

00:44.335 --> 00:48.967
The only other ingredient used in making the To'ak bars is pure cane sugar.

00:49.737 --> 00:53.807
The exclusive treat gets the name Cognac Cask Matured...

00:54.323 --> 00:59.079
...because it's aged for 18 months in a 50-year-old French oak cognac barrel.

01:01.855 --> 01:04.397
Only 100 bars are made each year.

01:04.765 --> 01:07.266
Jerry tells us they're almost all sold out.

01:07.840 --> 01:11.613
Each one comes in a handcrafted Spanish elmwood box...

01:12.235 --> 01:13.608
...with a bar number engraved on the back.

01:14.068 --> 01:18.477
And because the extraordinary delicacy should never be touched with bare hands,...

01:19.041 --> 01:23.513
...also inside: tasting tweezers made from Ecuadorian bamboo.
