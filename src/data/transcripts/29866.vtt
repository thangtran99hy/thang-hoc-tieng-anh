00:00.435 --> 00:04.651
The reason I am doing this series, discussions, scene work,...

00:04.820 --> 00:08.203
...one-on-one conversation about the craft of acting...

00:08.333 --> 00:12.233
If you've done well in the business, it's your obligation to send the elevator back down.

00:12.410 --> 00:14.631
Farther, farther, go farther, keep it up.

00:15.364 --> 00:18.237
That kind of mentorship, when someone says something to you...

00:18.736 --> 00:21.011
...at exactly the right moment that you need to hear it.

00:21.185 --> 00:24.089
It feels like the only stakes are will you get emotional at the end.

00:24.513 --> 00:26.867
Keep in that mode, sit on your hand.

00:27.571 --> 00:30.321
Engage in the craft.

00:30.529 --> 00:31.480
Put everything on cards.

00:31.667 --> 00:33.481
Read a great classic play.

00:34.243 --> 00:37.194
Go Netflix an extraordinary Spencer Tracy movie.

00:37.817 --> 00:38.529
House of Cards.

00:38.740 --> 00:39.541
House of Cards, whatever.

00:42.007 --> 00:43.261
People aren't paying to see the top of your head.

00:43.691 --> 00:44.307
Stand up like this.

00:44.748 --> 00:46.803
I tell you it's right because it's a focus puller.

00:47.269 --> 00:48.283
You gave me a great direction.

00:48.629 --> 00:52.264
The craft of acting is to step into someone else's shoes,...

00:52.665 --> 00:54.332
...someone else's ideas.

00:54.602 --> 01:03.059
To look at something in a mirror and not see ourselves and not feel weird but feel free.

01:04.490 --> 01:07.493
Hi, I'm Kevin Spacey and welcome to my master class.
