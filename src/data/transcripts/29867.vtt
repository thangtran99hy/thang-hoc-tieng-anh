ï»¿What is GDP or gross domestic product?

00:04.403 --> 00:05.463
And why should you even care?

00:11.129 --> 00:13.263
GDP is all around us.

00:13.611 --> 00:18.221
It's cars, clothes, doctors, hairdressers even.

00:18.533 --> 00:19.783
It's all part of GDP.

00:19.985 --> 00:24.360
Let me explain, some people produce goods like cars or clothes,...

00:24.751 --> 00:27.681
...others produce services like doctors or hairdressers,...

00:28.196 --> 00:33.833
...so if you add up the value of goods and services, you get gross domestic product.

00:34.291 --> 00:35.965
...or you can add up incomes.

00:36.325 --> 00:41.037
If you add up the income of all the United States in one year, you get US GDP.
