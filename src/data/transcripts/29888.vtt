00:01.861 --> 00:07.252
We are in the preliminary stage of one of the greatest battles in history.

00:08.059 --> 00:09.255
Mr. Winston Churchill.

00:09.413 --> 00:11.025
You have an enormous task ahead of you.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.285
Winston lacks judgement.

00:14.457 --> 00:15.327
He's a bully.

00:15.529 --> 00:16.850
We may have to replace him.

00:17.879 --> 00:19.765
All our forces are in Dunkirk.

00:19.979 --> 00:22.435
The Germans are pushing us into the sea.

00:23.605 --> 00:26.100
You have the full weight of the world on your shoulders.

00:26.205 --> 00:27.008
Are you not afraid?

00:27.396 --> 00:29.217
Most terribly.

00:30.475 --> 00:33.878
I speak to you for the first time as Prime Minister...

00:34.248 --> 00:37.709
...in a solemn hour, for the life of our country.

00:39.009 --> 00:41.795
You ask, what is our policy?

00:42.995 --> 00:50.438
I say it is to wage war by sea, land and air, with all our might.

00:51.325 --> 00:53.450
We shall never surrender!
