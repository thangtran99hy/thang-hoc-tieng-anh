00:02.599 --> 00:03.709
You are just the sweetest.

00:04.379 --> 00:05.155
My little puppy.

00:07.206 --> 00:10.344
Okay, so I'm Miley and I'm chilling with BuzzFeed.

00:11.053 --> 00:15.413
But more importantly, not more importantly but kind of, I'm playing with puppies.

00:15.581 --> 00:17.599
This is the only way I do interviews these days.

00:17.755 --> 00:19.626
I tell my rider I require puppies.

00:20.709 --> 00:21.883
You love me.

00:23.006 --> 00:23.660
Sorry, baby.

00:24.047 --> 00:24.587
Want to pick one?

00:25.514 --> 00:27.213
Okay, we're going to be answering some fan questions.

00:27.313 --> 00:27.957
You can sit on my lap.

00:28.784 --> 00:29.407
You want to eat my ring?

00:30.941 --> 00:34.533
There you go, okay, what does being younger now mean to you?

00:35.529 --> 00:40.181
Well, just like these puppies, all I want to do is be with my family...

00:40.252 --> 00:43.647
...and be with my friends and know what's important, which is being happy.

00:43.965 --> 00:45.271
You want to pick all the questions, don't you?

00:45.883 --> 00:48.210
Okay, I can't, this is the worst way to have me do an interview.

00:48.516 --> 00:49.957
I'm not leaving without this angel.

00:50.903 --> 00:51.789
Okay, next.

00:53.523 --> 00:56.567
Which song from Younger Now is the most special to you?

00:56.726 --> 01:00.203
Malibu was the first song that I wrote on this record so it's extra special to me.

01:00.666 --> 01:04.969
This was my favorite interview I've ever done ever in the history of my life...

01:05.132 --> 01:06.500
...for obvious puppy reasons.
