I'm here with BuzzFeed, I'm playing with tiny, cute kittens.

00:04.187 --> 00:04.972
My day is made.

00:08.813 --> 00:11.840
We designed for Belle this ring that would sit on her little finger.

00:12.033 --> 00:14.936
The costume designer saw that I had one which my mom had given to me.

00:15.425 --> 00:17.638
And she was like, "Can I design one for Belle...

00:17.722 --> 00:19.680
...because Belle's mother dies when she's really young."

00:20.021 --> 00:22.350
My mom is still alive and healthy and well, just as a side note.

00:22.443 --> 00:25.123
Anyway, I was really proud of the ring and thought it was so beautiful...

00:25.194 --> 00:27.251
...that I asked if I could keep one and they said I could.

00:27.701 --> 00:28.581
Do you want to come down?

00:28.903 --> 00:30.369
Is this a little high for you?

00:30.912 --> 00:32.374
Oh no, you kind of want to stay.

00:32.555 --> 00:35.156
Okay, you go here, you stay there.

00:38.109 --> 00:41.949
I would want her to know that she is a force to be reckoned with...

00:42.070 --> 00:46.530
...and never to underestimate her own power.

00:46.624 --> 00:50.359
Sometimes, particularly, young girls feel like their voice doesn't matter...

00:50.471 --> 00:52.011
...and what they have to say doesn't really matter.

00:52.254 --> 00:55.367
And I think I would want her to know that it does.

00:55.498 --> 00:57.696
Oh, some rose petals look.
