Lara, your father's gone.

00:02.174 --> 00:03.867
You could pick up where he left off.

00:04.715 --> 00:06.480
I see so much of him in you.

00:09.848 --> 00:10.499
Brilliant.

00:12.765 --> 00:13.296
Hello, sprout.

00:14.963 --> 00:17.156
If you're listening to this, then I must be dead.

00:18.067 --> 00:21.093
I found something, a tomb called the "Mother of Death."

00:22.927 --> 00:27.059
If Trinity succeeds, our world is in danger.

00:28.485 --> 00:30.262
Promise me you will stop them.

00:32.031 --> 00:32.673
I promise.

00:34.957 --> 00:36.429
I think I know where my dad went.

00:37.152 --> 00:39.197
That's right in the middle of the Devil Sea.

00:39.493 --> 00:40.557
It will be an adventure.

00:40.927 --> 00:42.367
Death is not an adventure.

01:03.665 --> 01:06.216
You can't be too careful these days, the world has gone bloody mad.

01:07.221 --> 01:07.802
I'll take two.
