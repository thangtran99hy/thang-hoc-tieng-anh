00:00.889 --> 00:04.418
ï»¿I was also very happy to meet Prime Minister Trudeau this morning.

00:05.057 --> 00:07.366
I am amazed by his embrace of refugees,...

00:07.702 --> 00:11.459
...his commitment to appointing Canada's first gender-balanced cabinet...

00:11.826 --> 00:16.943
...and his dedication to keeping women and girls at the center of your development strategy.

00:17.571 --> 00:19.792
We have heard so much about Prime Minister Trudeau,...

00:20.165 --> 00:24.596
...but one thing has surprised me: people are always talking about how young he is.

00:25.418 --> 00:29.988
They say that he is the second youngest prime minister in Canadian history.

00:30.497 --> 00:31.659
He does yoga.

00:31.843 --> 00:32.911
He has tattoos.

00:36.037 --> 00:37.132
And a lot more.

00:39.805 --> 00:44.642
And while I was coming here, everyone was telling me like shake the prime minister's hand...

00:44.750 --> 00:47.851
...and let us know how he looks in reality and...

00:49.498 --> 00:51.790
...and people were just so excited about meeting Trudeau.

00:52.397 --> 00:55.477
I don't think anyone cared about the Canadian honorary citizenship.

00:59.587 --> 01:05.790
While it may be true that Prime Minister Trudeau is young and he is a young head of government,...

01:06.393 --> 01:08.965
...I would like to tell something to the children of Canada:...

01:09.621 --> 01:14.433
...that you don't have to be as old as the very young Prime Minister Trudeau to be a leader.
