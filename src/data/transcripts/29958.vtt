00:02.027 --> 00:05.849
ï»¿This is the traditional protest of Catalonia's Independence supporters.

00:06.345 --> 00:10.613
They are furious with the Spanish cabinet deciding to suspend the region's autonomy...

00:10.897 --> 00:12.783
...and impose direct rule from Madrid.

00:14.529 --> 00:17.173
Catalonia's decade-long drive towards independence...

00:17.241 --> 00:20.444
...has relied on the power of peaceful public protests.

00:20.855 --> 00:24.553
But it's met total resistance from Madrid and the European Union,...

00:24.896 --> 00:29.412
...which doesn't want to encourage other separatist movements in France, Italy and Belgium.

00:30.095 --> 00:33.335
An important aspect is identity, recognition of national identity.

00:33.641 --> 00:35.788
A second important element is economy.

00:36.129 --> 00:41.081
Catalonia is a relatively rich region and would like to raise the taxes...

00:41.185 --> 00:44.855
...and to get its own share in its wealth.

00:45.259 --> 00:50.623
There are seven and a half million Catalans who comprise a sixth of Spain's population.

00:50.765 --> 00:54.733
Overall, Catalonia generates nearly a fifth of Spain's annual income.

00:55.153 --> 00:58.764
But Barcelona claims that of every tax dollar levied by Madrid,...

00:59.166 --> 01:02.178
...only 63 cents is reinvested in Catalonia.

01:02.635 --> 01:07.048
In particular, the shortfall has negatively impacted the region's infrastructure.

01:07.293 --> 01:12.624
The Catalan institutions had been asking for a long time for a new arrangement,...

01:12.769 --> 01:17.262
...a new constitutional arrangement allowing Catalonia to be recognized as a nation,...

01:17.377 --> 01:19.878
...allowing Catalonia to have a new financial system,...

01:20.350 --> 01:24.294
...and to get more powers in the international sphere.

01:24.407 --> 01:28.653
The Catalan government should show to the world that Catalonia wants to be a country...

01:28.741 --> 01:31.564
...and wants to be a partner to the other European countries.
