00:00.490 --> 00:03.649
Your Royal Highness, Meghan Markle, congratulations to you both.

00:04.269 --> 00:04.615
Thank you.

00:04.735 --> 00:07.773
Can we start with the proposal and the actual moment of your engagement?

00:07.834 --> 00:09.371
When did it happen, how did it happen?

00:10.783 --> 00:16.628
It happened a few weeks ago, early this month, here at our cottage.

00:17.598 --> 00:19.557
It's a standard, typical night for us.

00:19.629 --> 00:20.380
It's a cozy night.

00:21.272 --> 00:21.734
What were we doing?

00:21.806 --> 00:22.903
Just roasting chicken.

00:22.988 --> 00:26.045
And it was just an amazing surprise.

00:26.112 --> 00:30.167
It was so sweet and natural and very romantic.

00:31.042 --> 00:31.793
He got on one knee.

00:32.559 --> 00:32.707
Of course.

00:32.770 --> 00:34.213
Was it an instant "yes" from you?

00:34.899 --> 00:37.680
Yes, as a matter of fact, I could barely let you finish proposing.

00:37.932 --> 00:38.741
Can I say "Yes" now?

00:38.812 --> 00:40.408
She didn't even let me finish, she just said, "Can I say 'Yes'?"

00:41.404 --> 00:43.281
And then there was hugs and I had the ring on my finger,...

00:43.753 --> 00:45.277
... and I was like, "Can I give you the ring?"

00:45.336 --> 00:46.615
She was like, "Oh yes, the ring!"

00:46.747 --> 00:49.403
So you know, it was a really nice moment, it was just the two of us...

00:49.473 --> 00:52.628
...and I think I managed to catch her by surprise as well.

00:52.861 --> 00:53.187
Yeah.

00:53.417 --> 00:55.310
And this is how long after you first met?

00:56.073 --> 00:58.923
It would be a year and a half, two a little more than that.

00:59.064 --> 01:00.607
No, just probably about a year and a half.

01:01.296 --> 01:02.369
How did you first meet?

01:04.298 --> 01:06.923
Yes, we first met, we were introduced actually by a mutual friend,...

01:07.459 --> 01:11.965
...and then we met once, and then twice back-to-back, two dates in London...

01:12.339 --> 01:14.401
...and last July,...

01:14.615 --> 01:14.899
Yes.

01:15.101 --> 01:20.811
...beginning of July, and then it was, I think about three maybe four weeks later...

01:21.290 --> 01:25.399
...that I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana...

01:25.936 --> 01:29.913
...and we camped out with each other under the stars...

01:30.007 --> 01:32.947
...and we spent, she'd come to join me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic.

01:33.018 --> 01:35.155
So then, we were really by ourselves,...

01:35.306 --> 01:40.220
...which was crucial to me to make sure that we had a chance to get to know each other.
