ï»¿I use my Model X like my office.

00:05.947 --> 00:07.732
I do a lot of conference calls.

00:07.943 --> 00:11.312
Autopilot lets me do that when it's bumper-to-bumper,...

00:11.404 --> 00:14.331
...I can put on autopilot and know that we're gonna  be safe.

00:15.692 --> 00:17.203
Charging has never been a problem.

00:17.870 --> 00:20.073
Todd likens it to charging your cell phone.

00:20.155 --> 00:22.407
When you get home at night, you plug in your cell phone.

00:22.589 --> 00:23.738
That's how we do it with our cars.

00:26.996 --> 00:32.117
I don't think that there's another car out there that gets better the longer you own it.

00:32.696 --> 00:34.305
The performance is amazing.

00:34.524 --> 00:35.953
Technology is amazing.

00:36.088 --> 00:40.010
That's a huge testament to what's important to me, for my family.

00:40.331 --> 00:42.333
That's why we like Teslas because they keep up with us.

00:42.855 --> 00:43.838
And I love that.
