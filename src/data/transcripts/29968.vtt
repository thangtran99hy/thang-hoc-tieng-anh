00:00.346 --> 00:02.140
Alright, playtime is over.

00:02.562 --> 00:03.974
Time to get some lunch.

00:04.230 --> 00:05.283
Yay!

00:05.571 --> 00:10.082
Come on Peter, let's go get lunch with my mom and then we can race when we get back.

00:10.525 --> 00:14.329
Wait Maria, your mom said to put the toys away.

00:14.565 --> 00:17.608
Oh that's okay, we can put them away when we get back.

00:18.340 --> 00:23.058
But Maria, you should always clean up your toys after playtime.

00:23.596 --> 00:26.735
We're going to keep playing with the toys when we get back.

00:27.059 --> 00:29.238
Isn't it just easier to leave them out?

00:29.775 --> 00:32.397
When playtime is over, we should clean up.

00:32.659 --> 00:35.272
It's not safe to leave toys out.

00:36.128 --> 00:39.050
Why isn't it safe to leave toys on the floor?

00:39.791 --> 00:42.324
Someone could trip over them and get hurt.

00:42.645 --> 00:45.011
And the toys could get broken too.

00:45.520 --> 00:49.619
Oh no! I don't want anyone to get hurt!

00:51.039 --> 00:55.137
You're right, we should clean up the toys when playtime is over.

00:55.695 --> 00:56.673
Will you help me?

00:57.162 --> 00:58.041
Sure!
