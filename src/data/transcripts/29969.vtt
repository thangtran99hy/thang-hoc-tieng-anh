Thanks again for inviting me for a sleepover tonight, Peter.

00:09.365 --> 00:11.085
I love sleepovers.

00:23.511 --> 00:28.167
Chris, you should always shut off the water when you're not using it.

00:28.446 --> 00:31.430
But how will I brush my teeth without water?

00:32.010 --> 00:36.636
All you need is just enough to get your toothbrush wet like this.

00:41.135 --> 00:42.789
Why do I need to do that?

00:43.219 --> 00:44.934
There's water everywhere.

00:45.441 --> 00:51.149
In oceans, and lakes, and streams, and even when it rains.

00:51.556 --> 00:57.357
Well, you're right but not all that water is safe for us to drink.

00:57.772 --> 01:00.199
Here, imagine this.

01:00.809 --> 01:05.619
If you took all the water in the entire world and put it in one big pool,...

01:05.852 --> 01:07.214
...it will look like this.

01:07.493 --> 01:10.447
See, I told you that's a lot of water.

01:11.051 --> 01:14.631
It might look like a lot, but of all that water,...

01:14.771 --> 01:19.024
...only a tiny bit is safe for us to drink and use every day.

01:19.403 --> 01:22.759
Oh, that's not very much at all.

01:23.251 --> 01:25.276
No, it's not.

01:26.747 --> 01:29.731
That's why we have to be smart about how we use it.

01:30.721 --> 01:32.595
Wow, you're right, Peter.

01:32.993 --> 01:34.404
I didn't think of that.

01:35.147 --> 01:37.264
It's always smart to save water.
