ï»¿The California sea lion.

00:04.725 --> 00:05.456
Yes!

00:05.819 --> 00:07.113
Oh, hi everybody.

00:07.265 --> 00:10.281
My name is Leo, I am a junior ranger.

00:10.657 --> 00:12.386
And this is my puppy, Hero.

00:12.741 --> 00:14.455
Look Hero, I'm gonna score.

00:14.855 --> 00:17.428
One, two, three!

00:17.651 --> 00:20.201
Oops, almost.

00:21.904 --> 00:24.127
Oh, you found my basketball.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.869
Wow, you're really good.

00:28.017 --> 00:29.305
Bravo!

00:31.938 --> 00:36.067
This animal looks like the sea lions I've seen at the zoo performing tricks.

00:36.294 --> 00:37.575
You know what we should do?

00:37.966 --> 00:40.827
Let's take a photo and send it to my sister, Katie.

00:41.158 --> 00:43.337
She is also a junior ranger.

00:46.361 --> 00:48.658
Hi Katie, so what did you find?

00:48.899 --> 00:51.017
Hi Leo, you were right.

00:51.286 --> 00:54.431
The animal you found is a sea lion.

00:54.591 --> 00:58.287
And this one is a California sea lion.

00:58.488 --> 01:04.506
California sea lions are intelligent, have good memories, and learn fast.

01:04.671 --> 01:08.739
That's why they are often taught to perform tricks at zoos.

01:09.098 --> 01:12.584
Someone must have taught the sea lion to juggle balls.

01:12.939 --> 01:16.604
California sea lions can do a lot more than that.

01:16.974 --> 01:23.457
They're so clever, that the United States Navy uses them in missions.

01:23.629 --> 01:26.851
California sea lions have been taught by the Navy...

01:26.967 --> 01:31.377
...to perform tasks like picking up underwater objects.

01:31.645 --> 01:33.453
That's so cool!
