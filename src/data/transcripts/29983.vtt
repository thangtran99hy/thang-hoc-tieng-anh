Whoa, it's an elephant.

00:06.505 --> 00:07.966
I think it's a baby elephant.

00:09.161 --> 00:13.665
You know what we should do? Let's take a photo and send it to my sister, Katie.

00:13.995 --> 00:16.051
She is also a junior ranger.

00:16.703 --> 00:17.901
Hold still young one.

00:18.942 --> 00:22.421
Hi Katie, so did you find anything about the baby elephant?

00:22.940 --> 00:27.573
Hi Leo, the elephant you found is an Asian elephant.

00:27.916 --> 00:30.803
The largest land animal in Asia.

00:31.142 --> 00:33.675
Though they are smaller than the African elephant.

00:34.191 --> 00:38.478
Asian elephants can grow up to three meters tall.

00:38.845 --> 00:40.786
Wow, that's so big.

00:41.225 --> 00:44.453
Elephants have long noses called trunks.

00:44.764 --> 00:47.756
They use their trunks like we use our hands.

00:48.004 --> 00:51.589
With their trunks they can greet each other like a handshake...

00:51.781 --> 00:55.493
...and pick up objects as heavy as a tree.

00:56.046 --> 00:57.561
As heavy as a tree?

00:58.142 --> 01:00.513
Wow, elephant trunks sure are strong.

01:01.060 --> 01:04.926
Earlier we saw the baby elephant grab some grass with its trunk.

01:05.206 --> 01:07.685
That's because they need to eat a lot of food.

01:08.213 --> 01:15.679
They eat all kinds of grasses, small plants, bushes, fruit, twigs, tree bark, and roots.

01:16.023 --> 01:18.283
Where do Asian elephants live?

01:18.611 --> 01:22.043
The Asian elephant can be found in lowland forests...

01:22.239 --> 01:26.390
...and grasslands of India, China and Southeast Asia.

01:27.198 --> 01:28.890
Baby elephant must be hungry.

01:29.346 --> 01:30.957
We should bring it back to its mother.

01:31.363 --> 01:32.305
Come and join us.
