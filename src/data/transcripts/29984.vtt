ï»¿Kamilo beach is one of the dirtiest beaches in the world.

00:03.231 --> 00:06.591
A lot of the currents bring plastic in from the open ocean.

00:07.040 --> 00:10.607
The name Kamilo actually translates to "twisting currents".

00:15.119 --> 00:18.720
I went there to do a little bit of a beach cleanup and scope the area out.

00:18.823 --> 00:22.641
And that's when I started interacting with the material and seeing how I could use it,...

00:22.791 --> 00:27.125
...which inspired me to take action and to start Nurdle in the Rough.

00:28.458 --> 00:32.716
Nurdle in the Rough jewelry is jewelry that's made from ocean plastic.

00:32.881 --> 00:35.801
A lot of times people come up to me and ask me what kind of stone I'm wearing.

00:36.185 --> 00:41.166
It's really a great segue into a conversation about how much plastic is in our oceans.

00:45.065 --> 00:48.885
I'm really passionate about taking this ugly plastic pollution...

00:49.197 --> 00:51.181
...and transforming it into something beautiful...

00:51.290 --> 00:55.025
...these gemstones that are sleek and they have these beautiful textures...

00:55.095 --> 00:58.532
...and lines on them that tell the story of where this plastic has been.

01:00.372 --> 01:06.133
I cut the material up and I start rounding and shaping it and polishing it down by hand.

01:10.047 --> 01:15.743
I use all recycled sterling silver and I set the marine debris like I would a stone.

01:17.493 --> 01:22.634
I try to make designs that are eye-catching and have a little bit of an intrigue.

01:22.889 --> 01:24.225
Some are inspired by sea life...

01:24.330 --> 01:28.137
...and some are inspired by the beauty that I find in the material.
