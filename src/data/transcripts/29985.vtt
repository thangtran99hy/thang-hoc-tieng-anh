ï»¿Open.

00:16.519 --> 00:19.535
Open a door and it opens all the others.

00:20.210 --> 00:23.238
Open a mind and see what happens next.

00:24.495 --> 00:29.337
No great thing, no beautiful invention, was created in a vacuum.

00:31.084 --> 00:34.786
It happens when we leave our comfort zone and come together.

00:35.845 --> 00:41.737
...embrace faiths, cultures, disabilities, differences,...

00:42.676 --> 00:47.689
...embrace races, ages, ideologies, personalities,...

00:48.345 --> 00:52.039
...creating a tool or device nobody saw coming.

00:52.949 --> 00:56.897
Humanity is plural, not singular.

00:58.445 --> 01:03.772
The best way the world works is everybody in, nobody out.

01:05.389 --> 01:08.309
So, who we're made of is everyone,...

01:10.589 --> 01:14.231
...differences not just celebrated but essential.

01:16.265 --> 01:22.009
Many more women in charge, equal pay for equal work, everywhere.

01:22.813 --> 01:27.830
A new generation of Apple, more diverse than the one that came before.

01:29.375 --> 01:33.905
Open is not just who we are, but what we believe as a company...

01:34.758 --> 01:37.042
...because humanity isn't singular.

01:37.919 --> 01:38.717
It's plural.

01:41.673 --> 01:45.155
The truth is we don't see things the same.

01:47.207 --> 01:51.741
The power is, we don't see things the same.
