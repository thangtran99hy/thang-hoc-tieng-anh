00:01.509 --> 00:04.091
We were born into a world at war...

00:06.127 --> 00:08.401
...between the monsters that destroyed our cities...

00:09.613 --> 00:11.943
...and the monsters we created to stop them.

00:12.955 --> 00:14.477
We thought we had sacrificed enough.

00:17.363 --> 00:21.602
But the war we thought we finished is just beginning.

00:24.743 --> 00:27.124
And the only thing standing in front of the apocalypse...

00:30.671 --> 00:31.231
...is us.

00:37.050 --> 00:40.104
But it doesn't matter where you came from, who believed in you and who didn't.

00:44.395 --> 00:46.883
This is our time, this is our chance to make a difference.

00:51.985 --> 00:52.792
Now, let's get it done!

00:53.009 --> 00:54.279
That's what I'm talking about!

01:03.817 --> 01:04.665
They've evolved.

01:04.817 --> 01:06.247
And they could wipe out all life.
