Hi, I'm Sadie Sink and I'm here today to share with you what I learned...

00:04.056 --> 00:08.238
...while filming season two of Stranger Things: growing up 80s style.

00:11.967 --> 00:13.225
Can't live without your smartphone?

00:13.549 --> 00:14.511
80s kids did.

00:14.620 --> 00:17.231
Back then, phones had cords, weighed a ton...

00:17.324 --> 00:19.189
...and were typically attached to the kitchen wall.

00:19.397 --> 00:22.512
They were also useful for attempting to call your friends in the upside down.

00:22.977 --> 00:24.013
Barb, is that you?

00:24.945 --> 00:26.950
Creepy but Cuddly Aliens.

00:28.002 --> 00:29.083
Its ears.

00:29.464 --> 00:30.253
Floppy disks.

00:33.483 --> 00:37.617
In the 80s, Cabbage Patch Kids topped every kid's Christmas list.

00:38.039 --> 00:40.343
Parents stampeded through stores.

00:41.573 --> 00:42.655
I mean, they're kinda cute.

00:43.439 --> 00:44.056
Trapper Keeper.

00:47.327 --> 00:48.350
Dot Matrix Paper.

00:50.408 --> 00:53.901
The 80s brought us Nintendo, bringing the arcade to your living room.

00:54.281 --> 00:56.639
You just had to make sure to clean the cartridge before you play.

00:59.432 --> 01:00.523
Blue Eyeshadow.

01:02.481 --> 01:03.469
Shoulder Pads.

01:05.579 --> 01:06.271
I feel powerful.

01:06.905 --> 01:09.396
These little babies divided friends into two groups:...

01:09.629 --> 01:10.603
...those who could solve it,...

01:12.643 --> 01:15.441
...and those who peeled off the stickers to make it look like they could solve it.

01:15.680 --> 01:16.983
Home Workout Videos.

01:21.076 --> 01:25.031
In the 80s, the best way to romance a girl was to stand underneath her window,...

01:25.133 --> 01:27.455
...blaring a slow jam out of your boom box.
