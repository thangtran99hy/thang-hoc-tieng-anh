00:03.401 --> 00:05.733
Experiencing the Northern Lights is quite the spectacle.

00:06.137 --> 00:07.043
The beautiful light display...

00:07.118 --> 00:09.371
...can only be seen in the late fall and winter months though...

00:09.658 --> 00:11.637
...and only from the northernmost areas of the world...

00:12.007 --> 00:13.477
...or you can head over to Yellowknife.

00:13.683 --> 00:15.639
It's the capital city of the Northwest Territories...

00:15.711 --> 00:18.830
...and is located about 250 miles south of the Arctic Circle.

00:19.313 --> 00:21.405
It's famous for its gold and diamond mines...

00:21.633 --> 00:24.400
...and this city is also referred to as the Northern Lights capital of the world.

00:25.003 --> 00:27.907
Once you leave the city area, you can see the Northern Lights with such clarity...

00:27.999 --> 00:29.342
...that it's gonna take your breath away.

00:30.881 --> 00:32.260
Reykjavik is a beautiful area...

00:32.339 --> 00:34.835
...located on the very edge of the Arctic Circle in Iceland.

00:35.290 --> 00:38.078
It offers one of the most accessible ways to see the Northern Lights.

00:38.445 --> 00:41.748
The only catch is that transportation to and from Iceland can be a bit difficult...

00:41.843 --> 00:44.656
...especially during the winter season when the Northern Lights are most prominent.

00:45.723 --> 00:48.588
And our last city to check out the Northern Lights in is Kiruna, Sweden.

00:48.874 --> 00:51.890
It's the northernmost city in Sweden and is famous for being the perfect place...

00:51.949 --> 00:54.229
...to catch the Aurora Borealis and the midnight sun.

00:54.621 --> 00:58.521
Kiruna is actually located 145 miles north of the Arctic Circle.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.291
If you find yourself looking for a place to stay,...

01:01.558 --> 01:04.175
...be sure to check out the Ice Hotel just outside of Kiruna.
