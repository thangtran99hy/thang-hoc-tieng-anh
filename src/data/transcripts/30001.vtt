ï»¿There are about 3,000 restaurants specializing in fugu in Tokyo today.

00:05.754 --> 00:10.382
From the outside, they're usually easy to recognize and they're always highly specialized.

00:15.329 --> 00:17.943
One of them is Rikizo Okamoto's restaurant...

00:18.257 --> 00:20.484
...where sometimes even prime ministers drop by.

00:22.035 --> 00:24.971
Uosei is its name, the pure fish place.

00:25.921 --> 00:28.129
You also need a license to prepare fugu.

00:29.509 --> 00:32.116
The poison in fugu is tetrodotoxin.

00:32.469 --> 00:36.556
It's 1,000 times more potent than cyanide and there is no antidote.

00:37.669 --> 00:41.428
The poison paralyzes its victims but leaves them fully conscious.

00:43.664 --> 00:48.450
Proper preparation is critical: the skin and entrails of the fish are poisonous...

00:48.834 --> 00:52.230
...and they must not contaminate the nontoxic meat on the muscles.

00:53.895 --> 00:57.318
A real fugu meal consists of at least six courses.

01:03.359 --> 01:06.917
This ultimate in gourmet pleasures is mainly enjoyed in Japan...

01:07.050 --> 01:08.338
...when there is something to celebrate.

01:09.317 --> 01:14.247
Nowadays, the chances of being poisoned at a fugu restaurant are practically zero...

01:14.641 --> 01:16.995
...thanks to the high demands placed on the chefs.
