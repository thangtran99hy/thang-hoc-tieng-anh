Hello, my dear friends, my name is Joulupukki,...

00:04.902 --> 00:06.965
...but I'm also known as Santa Claus,...

00:07.607 --> 00:12.561
...Babbo Natale, Shengdan Laoren, Pere Noel and so on.

00:14.485 --> 00:17.861
Let me tell you about my hometown of Rovaniemi.

00:19.389 --> 00:23.649
Rovaniemi is situated on the Arctic Circle in Laplands.

00:25.672 --> 00:28.784
It is home for many wonderful and nice people.

00:30.909 --> 00:33.650
There are also quite a few reindeer in Rovaniemi.

00:34.850 --> 00:36.859
Rovaniemi is a very beautiful town.

00:37.550 --> 00:40.732
In winter, it's covered with a white curtain of snow...

00:42.044 --> 00:45.387
...and at night, we can see the magical Northern Lights.

00:49.083 --> 00:52.753
Every year, many of my friends from all over the world come visit me.

00:54.540 --> 00:57.495
In Rovaniemi, they feel the true Christmas spirits.

00:58.131 --> 01:00.771
I like to share it with family and friends.

01:02.021 --> 01:07.019
My dear friends, it is my great pleasure to invite you to visit Rovaniemi...
