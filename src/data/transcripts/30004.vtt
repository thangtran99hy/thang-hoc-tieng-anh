00:01.065 --> 00:04.905
If I were a young woman now, I'm not sure how I'd cope.

00:05.796 --> 00:09.644
With all the things that you have, the opportunities, the technology,...

00:10.707 --> 00:13.021
...I'd like to think it could be a world of pleasure,...

00:13.602 --> 00:16.947
...but I fear instead it would only be a world of pressure.

00:17.263 --> 00:23.332
Pressure to be the perfect mother, the perfect wife, the perfect friend,...

00:23.925 --> 00:27.037
...pressure to be successful, a boss, a leader.

00:27.718 --> 00:36.487
If I had my time again, I wouldn't create a to-do list; I'd create it to don't-do list.

00:37.062 --> 00:40.287
I'd give myself the time to indulge in the things...

00:40.377 --> 00:42.999
...that I now understand are the most important.

00:43.926 --> 00:48.409
What I wouldn't give to extend those good night kisses...

00:50.345 --> 00:53.029
...instead of moaning about having to get up early in the morning.

00:56.113 --> 00:59.143
Oh, what I wouldn't give for an extra second of cuddling my babies...

00:59.261 --> 01:01.291
...before they became too big to hold.

01:02.617 --> 01:07.263
What I wouldn't give for five more minutes on the dance floor...

01:07.948 --> 01:10.735
...while my legs were still strong enough to carry me.

01:12.687 --> 01:15.403
This is simply about you as a human being.

01:17.019 --> 01:19.530
There is the most important word: being...

01:21.237 --> 01:22.722
...being lost in the moment,...

01:23.747 --> 01:25.369
...being at peace with the world,...

01:26.124 --> 01:27.648
...being kinder to myself,...

01:29.475 --> 01:30.727
...being kinder to others,...

01:33.189 --> 01:36.373
...being able to let go and being proud to do so.

01:37.997 --> 01:43.755
Believe me, if I were a young woman now, I'd spend more time being,...

01:44.613 --> 01:45.733
...not doing.
