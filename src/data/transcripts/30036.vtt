ï»¿Baby girl, I won't mind if you play tennis badly.

00:11.538 --> 00:14.336
I won't mind if you choose to never pick up a racquet.

00:16.363 --> 00:25.415
But I beg you, in this game of life, please keep playing no matter what.

00:28.927 --> 00:34.079
Just like it taught me, sports will teach you to be strong.

00:36.779 --> 00:40.445
You'll discover the power and grace of your body.

00:44.414 --> 00:48.699
You'll learn to move and you'll learn the way to move others.

00:49.382 --> 00:52.366
Sports will teach you the strength of your allies.

00:53.051 --> 00:56.035
Whether your bond is by blood or by ball,...

00:58.686 --> 01:02.537
...whether she shares the color of your skin or the color of your jersey,...

01:04.025 --> 01:06.575
...you'll find your sisters in sweat.

01:07.370 --> 01:10.107
Sometimes you'll score goals, sometimes you won't.

01:12.549 --> 01:15.038
But the goals you set, you'll reach together.

01:16.337 --> 01:21.302
You'll find the courage to stand tall, work harder,...

01:22.253 --> 01:26.785
...and speak louder on whatever playing field you choose in life.

01:27.866 --> 01:29.736
So, keep playing, my girl.

01:31.059 --> 01:32.247
Keep playing.
