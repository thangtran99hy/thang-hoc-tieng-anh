00:08.735 --> 00:09.346
Santa?

00:09.487 --> 00:09.953

Hello?

00:13.800 --> 00:14.600
Santa!

00:14.793 --> 00:16.353
Oh, I'm ever so sorry.

00:16.711 --> 00:18.001
I'm not Santa.

00:28.271 --> 00:29.332
And one from Grandad.

00:30.507 --> 00:32.057

Let's take your sleigh!

00:41.234 --> 00:41.843
Sleigh?

00:42.043 --> 00:42.465
Giddy-up.

00:50.901 --> 00:52.460
Merry Christmas!

00:57.826 --> 00:58.331
Look!

00:59.031 --> 01:01.334
I'm super Alice!

01:06.135 --> 01:07.680
Oh, I almost forgot.

01:09.142 --> 01:10.549
Merry Christmas, Mr. Claus.

Oh, thank you little bear.
