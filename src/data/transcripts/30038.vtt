00:00.092 --> 00:02.565
There are 196 countries in the world today...

00:02.667 --> 00:05.961
...and virtually none of them have purple on their national flag.

00:06.529 --> 00:11.681
Throughout history, purple was never used to represent a kingdom, civilization or empire.

00:12.145 --> 00:13.677
So, what's wrong with purple?

00:13.973 --> 00:15.873
It's such a popular color today.

00:16.389 --> 00:18.723
Why would no country use it in their flag?

00:19.851 --> 00:22.000
The answer is really quite simple.

00:22.667 --> 00:24.923
Purple was just far too expensive.

00:25.439 --> 00:27.386
No countries have purple on their flag...

00:27.478 --> 00:32.351
...because up until the 1800s, purple was worth more than its weight in gold.

00:33.341 --> 00:35.675
The color purple has been associated with royalty,...

00:35.760 --> 00:37.450
...power and wealth for centuries.

00:37.732 --> 00:40.899
In fact, Queen Elizabeth the 1st forbade anyone...

00:40.991 --> 00:43.912
...except close members of the Royal Family to wear it.

00:44.597 --> 00:46.935
Purple's elite status stems from the rarity...

00:47.021 --> 00:49.820
...and the cost of the dye originally used to produce it.

00:50.329 --> 00:55.109
The dye initially used to make purple came from the Phoenician trading city of Tyre,...

00:55.373 --> 00:57.305
...which is now in modern-day Lebanon.

00:57.904 --> 01:01.051
Fabric traders obtain the dye from a small sea snail...

01:01.133 --> 01:04.179
...that was only found in the Tyre region of the Mediterranean.

01:04.913 --> 01:07.154
A lot of work went into producing the dye...

01:07.447 --> 01:13.465
...as more than 10,000 snails were needed to create just one gram of Tyrean purple.

01:14.114 --> 01:17.408
Since only wealthy rulers could afford to buy and wear the color,...

01:17.631 --> 01:21.915
...it became associated with the Imperial classes of Rome, Egypt and Persia.

01:22.977 --> 01:25.993
A single pound of dye costs three pounds of gold,...

01:26.267 --> 01:29.808
...which is the equivalent of 56,000 dollars today.

01:31.433 --> 01:34.852
So, since the sheer price of purple was so astronomically high...

01:35.107 --> 01:39.484
... no one, not even the richest nations could afford to have purple on their flag.

01:40.087 --> 01:44.248
The hue became more accessible to lower classes about a century and a half ago.

01:44.813 --> 01:49.288
In 1856, 18-year-old English chemist William Henry Perkin...

01:49.553 --> 01:52.741
...accidentally created a synthetic purple compound...

01:53.031 --> 01:57.254
...while attempting to synthesize Quinine, an anti malaria drug.

01:57.765 --> 02:01.060
He noticed that the compound could be used to dye fabrics.

02:01.363 --> 02:06.143
So he patented the dye, manufactured it, and got filthy rich.

02:07.045 --> 02:10.958
Purple dye was then mass-produced so just about everybody could afford it.
