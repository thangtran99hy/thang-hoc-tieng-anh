00:00.162 --> 00:02.989
When this Oklahoma farmer dropped his phone,...

00:03.231 --> 00:05.499
...there seemed little hope he'd see it again.

00:05.981 --> 00:11.191
I had it in my pocket, like that, bent over to work on a hopper bottom door,...

00:11.934 --> 00:14.067
...and it fell out of my pocket into the grain pit.

00:14.537 --> 00:18.640
I went up the elevator and I thought, "I'll never see that phone again."
