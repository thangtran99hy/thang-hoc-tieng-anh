You get obsessed with things sometimes.

00:03.941 --> 00:04.885
I mean very obsessed...

00:05.339 --> 00:06.399
...and you really get into it.

00:06.486 --> 00:06.695
Right.

00:06.860 --> 00:09.262
And then you just sort of drop it one day and you move on...

00:09.347 --> 00:10.813
...and you get obsessed with something else.

00:10.933 --> 00:12.429
What is your latest obsession?

00:12.506 --> 00:13.774
What's the thing you're obsessed with these days?

00:13.918 --> 00:14.605
K-Pop.

00:15.144 --> 00:15.591
K-Pop?

00:18.223 --> 00:19.602
It's Korean pop music.

00:19.704 --> 00:19.894
Yeah.

00:20.204 --> 00:22.968
And it's beyond excellent.

00:23.227 --> 00:25.169
It's the best thing you've ever seen.

00:25.381 --> 00:26.971
It's the best thing you've ever seen.

00:27.465 --> 00:27.914
What is it about?

00:28.002 --> 00:28.920
Is it the videos?

00:28.987 --> 00:29.593
Is it the music?

00:29.687 --> 00:30.818
Is it the whole thing combined?

00:30.900 --> 00:31.944
It's all so addictive.

00:32.198 --> 00:32.314
Yeah.

00:32.653 --> 00:33.339
Very addictive.

00:34.121 --> 00:35.097
Do you have a current favorite?

00:37.913 --> 00:40.038
When we did the Spiderman premiere in Seoul, Korea,...

00:40.113 --> 00:42.179
...we were onstage with a band called 2ne1.

00:43.865 --> 00:44.287
Do you see?

00:44.368 --> 00:44.761
Wow!
