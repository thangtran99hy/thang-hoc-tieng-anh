00:01.242 --> 00:04.697
Rian has written a story that's unexpected but right.

00:07.193 --> 00:10.029
Some of the stuff that happens, people are gonna be like, "Oh my god!"

00:13.674 --> 00:15.285
Even though I think I know it all,...

00:15.410 --> 00:18.829
...they throw things at me storywise I never could have imagined.

00:21.613 --> 00:24.705
And even though everybody knows that it's the second in the trilogy,...

00:24.893 --> 00:26.193
...it feels like its own thing.

00:34.395 --> 00:34.613
Go!

00:36.157 --> 00:38.516
Star Wars is so cool because there's all these creatures...

00:39.508 --> 00:40.835
...and all these amazing visual effects.

00:43.015 --> 00:45.330
But all the characters are also so complex.

00:46.964 --> 00:48.806
Rian needs to work on his Wookiee sounds.

00:51.583 --> 00:52.867
Ridiculous new director.

00:52.965 --> 00:54.245
Can't even just learn a Wookiee sound.

00:59.712 --> 01:02.167
It feels like the storylines are becoming established.

01:03.559 --> 01:05.804
We're really getting to know these new characters,...

01:06.734 --> 01:09.068
...also with the characters that we know and love.

01:10.935 --> 01:12.674
We're seeing their lives change.

01:15.660 --> 01:19.690
Everything is being shifted in the opposite way to what the audience expected after 7.

01:20.892 --> 01:23.154
Rian has made Star Wars fresh and new.
