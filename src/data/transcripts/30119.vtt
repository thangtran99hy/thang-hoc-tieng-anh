ï»¿You are an international actress.

00:02.854 --> 00:03.929
You grew up in Tokyo.

00:04.527 --> 00:06.237
No, actually I grew up in Hawaii,...

00:07.587 --> 00:08.741
...but I was born in Tokyo.

00:09.427 --> 00:11.811
I've been living there for about four years,...

00:11.880 --> 00:14.503
...coming back and forth, going back and forth from the States and Japan...

00:15.264 --> 00:17.924
...and this is my first film that's shot in the States.

00:18.039 --> 00:19.126
Yeah, thank you.

00:19.242 --> 00:24.491
Well, I'm hoping it's helping me to represent my country well...

00:24.600 --> 00:29.841
...and to be able to represent the Asian community in the film industry here.

00:32.401 --> 00:35.323
I could speak Japanese before I went over four years ago,...

00:35.439 --> 00:42.093
...but now that I've really reestablished my language and the culture more,...

00:42.164 --> 00:46.893
...I think I can better represent them and show what we are...

00:46.969 --> 00:48.700
...and what our country's about.

00:48.841 --> 00:49.284
Yeah.
