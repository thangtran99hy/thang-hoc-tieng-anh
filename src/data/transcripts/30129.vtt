So what is bitcoin?

00:01.719 --> 00:04.257
Bitcoin has been on a wild ride lately,...

00:04.405 --> 00:06.765
...seemingly every day is bringing new highs.

00:07.501 --> 00:11.655
Bitcoin is a digital network that allows two people to exchange value directly...

00:11.760 --> 00:13.661
...between each other without any middlemen.

00:14.499 --> 00:17.566
That sounds confusing. Just think of it as online cash.

00:17.998 --> 00:20.793
This is a highly speculative asset right now.

00:21.062 --> 00:25.749
This is a big bet on a new technology and that becomes very alluring to people.

00:26.079 --> 00:28.986
But if you really want to invest in bitcoin at this point,...

00:29.720 --> 00:31.391
...you basically have to buy it directly.

00:31.961 --> 00:35.274
To do that, you need to go online, get yourself a bitcoin wallet,...

00:35.778 --> 00:36.905
...find a bitcoin exchange...

00:37.224 --> 00:38.119
...and put in a buy order.

00:38.613 --> 00:43.431
But keep in mind, this is a small, volatile, largely unregulated...

00:43.569 --> 00:46.199
...and still very highly speculative market.
