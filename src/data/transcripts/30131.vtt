ï»¿I think that there is no one perfect way to do this.

00:09.339 --> 00:13.189
I've somehow taken in the idea that there is a perfect way to do this.

00:17.271 --> 00:20.216
Everybody wants to be the best parent.

00:20.473 --> 00:23.957
Everybody wants to raise this perfect kid.

00:26.571 --> 00:29.618
The hardest thing about parenting for me is...

00:30.602 --> 00:33.631
...knowing if I have given or done enough for them every day.

00:33.994 --> 00:35.113
Am I pushing them too hard?

00:36.252 --> 00:37.481
Am I not pushing them hard enough?

00:37.828 --> 00:40.209
I always feel like he deserves more than I can give him.

00:41.083 --> 00:46.720
You know, I wish I could be like, home at 4:00, making a gourmet meal...

00:46.781 --> 00:47.941
..and we'd all sit down.

00:48.151 --> 00:51.975
And it's difficult to look back and think, "Wow, I should have been there."

00:53.485 --> 00:55.123
I worry that he's gonna grow out of me,...

00:55.661 --> 00:56.755
...that there's not gonna be time.

00:58.105 --> 01:03.604
You're never gonna feel like you were doing it right, because it's too important.

01:03.968 --> 01:07.617
I just want them to know I'm really trying, I'm really, really trying, you know.

01:16.886 --> 01:20.117
She's like, the best and she like, holds our family together.

01:20.249 --> 01:23.485
No, I mean he's like, a great dad, not like so-so.

01:23.703 --> 01:27.495
I hope to be half of the mom that she is because she set the standards really high.

01:27.829 --> 01:30.105
I'm trying not to cry honestly because talking about her...

01:30.171 --> 01:32.551
When I say she's my heart, she means the world to me.

01:32.963 --> 01:38.105
I'm the luckiest for a lot of reasons but my parents being the top two.

01:38.555 --> 01:41.569
She has a pure heart and cares about people.

01:52.096 --> 01:53.146
I love you so much.

01:56.434 --> 01:57.737
I think my daddy's great.
