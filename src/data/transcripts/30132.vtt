When my little brother Lucas was born,...

00:02.825 --> 00:05.085
...my parents were told that he wouldn't walk or talk...

00:05.209 --> 00:08.619
...and the doctors even said he might not make it to his 10th birthday.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.733
But today, a few months away from his 10th birthday,...

00:12.899 --> 00:15.321
...we're doing our 15th triathlon together.

00:23.484 --> 00:27.593
About four years ago, our boys started doing triathlons together.

00:27.682 --> 00:30.997
In most cases, that wouldn't be a big deal, a lot of kids do triathlons.

00:31.132 --> 00:35.993
But there's something very special about the way our boys do triathlons.

00:38.161 --> 00:41.708
I wanted to do this because Lucas can't do things like we can.

00:41.789 --> 00:45.585
He can't really play sports so this is something we could do together.

00:46.631 --> 00:50.605
Currently we're training for our 15th triathlon, which is this weekend.

00:52.051 --> 00:53.844
Before the race, I always feel nervous.

00:53.931 --> 00:57.497
I don't think I'll ever get over that and I just don't want to hurt Lucas.

00:57.887 --> 01:00.293
I don't care if I win the race, he just has to be okay.
