ï»¿In my career, what I've always tried my best to do,...

00:04.781 --> 00:07.442
...whether on television or through film,...

00:07.903 --> 00:13.707
...is to say something about how men and women really behave;...

00:13.834 --> 00:19.329
...to say how we experience shame, how we love and how we rage,...

00:19.401 --> 00:26.804
...how we fail, how we retreat, persevere and how we overcome.

00:27.709 --> 00:29.420
I've interviewed and portrayed people...

00:29.487 --> 00:32.674
...who've withstood some of the ugliest things life can throw at you,...

00:32.761 --> 00:35.413
...but the one quality all of them seem to share...

00:35.815 --> 00:44.221
...is an ability to maintain hope for a brighter morning, even during our darkest nights.

00:44.968 --> 00:52.464
So I want all the girls watching here and now to know that a new day is on the horizon.

00:56.432 --> 01:00.939
And when that new day finally dawns,...

01:04.768 --> 01:08.715
...it will be because of a lot of magnificent women,...

01:09.297 --> 01:12.035
...many of whom are right here in this room tonight,...

01:12.645 --> 01:18.508
...and some pretty phenomenal men fighting hard to make sure...

01:18.989 --> 01:22.937
...that they become the leaders who take us to the time...

01:23.311 --> 01:28.781
...when nobody ever has to say "Me too" again.

01:30.538 --> 01:30.809
Thank you.
