ï»¿It's lunch time here at this kindergarten in Japan...

00:05.225 --> 00:09.071
...and the children are eager to see what their parents have made for them.

00:09.793 --> 00:14.383
In this country, a dry sandwich wrapped in tinfoil just won't do.

00:14.493 --> 00:19.385
The packed lunch has been elevated to something near an art form.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.272
On this table, there's some great ones.

00:31.339 --> 00:34.013
Here's "Hello Kitty" and a teddy bear.

00:34.893 --> 00:38.157
And right next to her friend, that's a piano.

00:40.623 --> 00:41.243
It's great, isn't it?

00:43.815 --> 00:49.107
Now, some people need a bit of help to learn how to make the perfect packed lunch,...

00:49.173 --> 00:50.847
...the perfect "bento."

00:51.116 --> 00:55.003
The lady who lives in this flat is an acknowledged expert.

00:56.231 --> 01:00.006
Today, Tomomi Maruo is teaching her class of moms...

01:00.135 --> 01:03.169
...how to make a cartoon character called "Totoro"...

01:03.535 --> 01:05.753
...using rice and sesame seeds,...

01:06.311 --> 01:09.227
...as well as a teddy bear's face out of fish cakes.

01:09.913 --> 01:11.565
It's not easy for the students.

01:12.062 --> 01:18.511
We have this idea of presentation, how it looks and precision.

01:19.313 --> 01:22.673
So, I think that's part of this culture.

01:23.015 --> 01:24.607
So, who are these, these portraits?

01:25.731 --> 01:26.632
Michael Jackson.

01:26.702 --> 01:27.524
Michael Jackson.

01:28.163 --> 01:29.387
That's Harrison Ford.

01:30.155 --> 01:31.283
As in Indiana Jones?

01:31.405 --> 01:33.257
With the Indiana Jones hat and stubble.

01:33.643 --> 01:34.479
How did you do the stubble?

01:35.267 --> 01:36.834
It's seaweeds, little seaweeds.

01:37.547 --> 01:40.997
And do you do this kind of character bento every day?

01:43.307 --> 01:44.165
That's very devoted.

01:46.501 --> 01:47.003
It's fun.

01:47.340 --> 01:50.413
I enjoy doing it and my kids enjoy it.

01:51.246 --> 01:56.575
Back in the kindergarten, lunch is coming to a very noisy end.

01:56.798 --> 01:58.133
None of it lasted very long,...

01:58.453 --> 02:01.917
...the cute pandas, the colorful characters.

02:02.021 --> 02:06.553
What took hours to make has been gobbled in a matter of minutes.
