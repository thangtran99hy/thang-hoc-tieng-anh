ï»¿Friends, followers, subscribers,...

00:04.156 --> 00:09.438
...we are gathered here today to bid farewell to the technology that died in 2017.

00:09.867 --> 00:13.940
This year, we saw several Microsoft products meet their blue screen of death.

00:14.283 --> 00:17.457
In April, Microsoft ended life support for Windows Vista.

00:17.787 --> 00:20.152
The company also hung up on Windows Phone,...

00:20.329 --> 00:23.093
...with an executive saying no new features were coming...

00:23.197 --> 00:25.233
...for the Windows mobile operating system.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.689
Groove Music faded from existence.

00:27.842 --> 00:32.312
Subscribers of the streaming music service were encouraged to migrate to Spotify.

00:32.780 --> 00:35.279
Apple let go of the Shuffle and Nano this year.

00:35.541 --> 00:38.619
It seems Apple lost faith in plain old MP3 players.

00:39.005 --> 00:41.247
But perhaps the loss that stings the most...

00:41.579 --> 00:44.718
...is having to say goodbye forever to AOL Instant Messenger,...

00:44.827 --> 00:46.067
..better known as AIM.

00:46.532 --> 00:49.517
AIM defined what chat was for an entire generation...

00:49.770 --> 00:51.697
...but many turned their back on their buddy list...

00:51.922 --> 00:54.814
...when smartphones and social media made AIM irrelevant.
