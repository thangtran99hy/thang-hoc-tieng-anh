ï»¿But I've got a challenge for all the guys, because men love challenges.

00:08.684 --> 00:11.167
I challenge you to see if you can use the same qualities...

00:11.245 --> 00:14.911
...that you feel make you a man to go deeper into yourself,...

00:16.950 --> 00:19.315
Your strength, your bravery, your toughness.

00:20.107 --> 00:24.081
Can we redefine what those mean and use them to explore our hearts?

00:26.606 --> 00:29.776
Are you brave enough to be vulnerable?

00:32.122 --> 00:34.363
To reach out to another man when you need help?

00:35.303 --> 00:37.110
To dive headfirst into your shame?

00:38.429 --> 00:40.392
Are you strong enough to be sensitive,...

00:41.631 --> 00:44.553
...to cry whether you are hurting or you're happy,...

00:45.178 --> 00:46.614
...even if it makes you look weak?

00:48.251 --> 00:52.287
Are you confident enough to listen to the women in your life,...

00:54.161 --> 00:55.712
...to hear their ideas and their solutions?

00:55.793 --> 00:59.551
To hold their anguish and actually believe them,...

01:00.370 --> 01:02.053
...even if what they're saying is against you?

01:03.683 --> 01:09.020
And will you be man enough to stand up to other men when you hear "locker-room talk"?

01:09.839 --> 01:12.230
When you hear stories of sexual harassment?

01:12.334 --> 01:14.694
Will you actually stand up and do something...

01:14.780 --> 01:16.607
...so that one day we don't have to live in a world...

01:16.706 --> 01:18.133
...where a woman has to risk everything...

01:18.217 --> 01:20.056
...and come forward to say the words, "Me too"?
