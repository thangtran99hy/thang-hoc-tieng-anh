Amy, it says you are trained in technology.

00:02.353 --> 00:03.504
That's very good.

00:03.843 --> 00:04.908
Are you adept at Excel?

00:05.872 --> 00:06.349
No.

00:07.081 --> 00:07.796
PowerPoint?

00:08.047 --> 00:08.591
No.

00:09.479 --> 00:10.101
Publisher?

00:10.829 --> 00:11.931
Not really.

00:13.692 --> 00:17.087
Exactly in what area of technology are you proficient?

00:18.193 --> 00:22.263
Snapchat, Pinterest, Instagram, Vine, Twitter.

00:22.764 --> 00:23.767
You know, the big ones.

00:24.233 --> 00:26.121
I'm surprised you didn't say Facebook.

00:30.990 --> 00:33.835
That's for old people like my parents.

00:35.860 --> 00:36.775
That's funny.

00:36.957 --> 00:38.873
Well Amy, when you're working for me,...

00:39.704 --> 00:42.212
...you have to have those kinds of research skills because I'll send you things for you...

00:42.289 --> 00:44.699
...to comb through and get the answers and send them to me.

00:44.793 --> 00:47.003
So for that, you got to be really good at technology.

00:47.404 --> 00:49.583
For stuff like that, no problem.

00:49.859 --> 00:51.110
I'll just ask Siri.
