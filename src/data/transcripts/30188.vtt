How did you get here?

Horse?

00:04.128 --> 00:05.999
I drove my car.

00:06.586 --> 00:09.260
I own it after eight more payments.

00:09.563 --> 00:10.097
What?

00:10.701 --> 00:11.367
How did you get here?

00:11.828 --> 00:12.798
I took an Uber.

00:13.901 --> 00:15.164

I voted.

00:36.973 --> 00:37.561
Touche.

00:39.859 --> 00:44.709
This is the only way you'll ever own a house.

00:44.891 --> 00:48.432
Learning how to text is the only way you'll ever communicate with your son.
