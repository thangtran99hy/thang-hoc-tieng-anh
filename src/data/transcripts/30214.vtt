ï»¿Next time you're driving, consider this.

00:04.971 --> 00:09.139
There's about one handprint of tread connecting each of your tires to the road.

00:10.467 --> 00:15.142
That's just four handprints to carry you through some of life's most important journeys...

00:16.411 --> 00:21.429
...and make sure when you say goodbye, you return safe to say hello again.

00:22.941 --> 00:27.808
So when it comes to choosing tires for your car, whose hands do you want to be in?
