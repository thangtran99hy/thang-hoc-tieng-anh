ï»¿Hi, I'm Nikki.

00:01.125 --> 00:01.735
This is Clark.

00:02.128 --> 00:02.296
Hey!

00:02.700 --> 00:03.732
And we love corgis!

00:03.836 --> 00:05.994
When I was growing up, my mom didn't really like pets...

00:06.077 --> 00:08.277
...so I wasn't really allowed to have any dogs or anything.

00:08.456 --> 00:10.116
I asked for a dog and I got a little brother.

00:12.394 --> 00:13.897
Okay, remove the blindfold.

00:18.691 --> 00:20.043
Corgis everywhere!

00:22.376 --> 00:23.031
There's so many.

00:26.898 --> 00:28.262
It's the best thing ever.

00:28.647 --> 00:30.073
Why are you all twins?

00:30.874 --> 00:33.071
Well, I simply believe corgis are the best dogs in the world.

00:33.507 --> 00:38.155
They're the only dogs that can elicit a crowd and emotion like today.
