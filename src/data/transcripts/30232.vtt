There's also been a lot of scrutiny lately about the culture in Silicon Valley,...

00:04.222 --> 00:08.145
...the treatment of women in Silicon Valley and some of the other big tech companies.

00:08.317 --> 00:12.094
As a leader, you look at that and say what?

00:12.311 --> 00:13.348
What needs to change?

00:13.812 --> 00:14.015
Wow!

00:14.375 --> 00:20.190
I think it's really important to continue to encourage women...

00:20.363 --> 00:22.224
...to be a part of the tech community.

00:22.595 --> 00:24.608
When there are more women in the tech community,...

00:24.683 --> 00:26.873
...I think things will most definitely change.

00:26.951 --> 00:31.036
I think being part of Facebook, Instagram has been an incredible experience.

00:31.151 --> 00:34.318
Sheryl Sandberg is leading the company...

00:34.403 --> 00:38.870
...and internally, we have lots of conversations about unconscious bias.

00:39.055 --> 00:42.151
I think that we have a lot of work to do...

00:42.813 --> 00:45.662
...and this is something that we're most definitely focused on...

00:45.754 --> 00:47.309
...and I am focused on it in Instagram.
