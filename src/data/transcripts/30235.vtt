00:00.789 --> 00:03.980
You can look at these ancient hills and see nothing,...

00:05.721 --> 00:08.370
...or you can see nothing to hold you back.

00:09.780 --> 00:15.247
No set ways of thinking, no restrictions, no divisions, no excuses,...

00:16.174 --> 00:17.960
...just endless potential.

00:19.320 --> 00:23.073
This is the blank page you need to write humanity's next chapter:...

00:24.071 --> 00:24.737
...Neom.

00:27.006 --> 00:30.761
Over 25,000 square kilometers of inspiration...

00:31.605 --> 00:33.535
...with room for your biggest ideas,...

00:34.901 --> 00:38.675
...a part of the world set aside for those who want to change the world,...

00:39.773 --> 00:42.909
...a land created to free people from stress,...

00:43.817 --> 00:47.409
...a place where pioneers and thinkers and doers...

00:47.518 --> 00:50.185
...can exchange ideas and get things done.

00:52.029 --> 00:54.273
A startup the size of a country...

00:55.227 --> 00:57.894
...that will change the way we live and work forever,...

00:58.271 --> 01:03.137
Healthier, happier with more time for the things that really matter.

01:05.015 --> 01:09.545
A truly global culture from every place and background you can imagine...

01:10.661 --> 01:13.717
...that can show the rest of the planet how it's done...

01:16.090 --> 01:18.854
...with energy that flows from the sun and wind,...

01:19.635 --> 01:22.222
...neighborhoods that can feed and clean themselves,...

01:22.690 --> 01:25.661
...technologies that make life everything it can be.

01:27.243 --> 01:32.722
This is where we can prepare together for the next era of human progress.

01:35.169 --> 01:38.601
Some will look at these ancient hills and see nothing,...

01:39.612 --> 01:44.805
...but the rest of the world will know that this is where a new way of living began.

01:49.283 --> 01:50.359
