00:04.809 --> 00:07.105
One of the best movers to watch around the courts...

00:07.289 --> 00:09.307
...nearly of all time, I've seen some pretty fast ones...

00:09.391 --> 00:12.642
...but what I've seen in recent times, particularly at the Australian Open,...

00:12.924 --> 00:14.289
...it's so much fun to watch.

00:18.823 --> 00:21.344
21-year-old hungry kid, doesn't show much respect for anyone,...

00:21.519 --> 00:23.822
...doesn't really care who that person is or who that champion is.

00:27.273 --> 00:29.171
He made his initial breakthrough in 2014...

00:29.273 --> 00:31.281
...and it didn't initially work out that well for Hyeon...

00:31.390 --> 00:33.272
...but I think he's coping with it a lot better this time.

00:33.359 --> 00:34.268
He's a lot more comfortable.

00:34.498 --> 00:36.529
He feels more confident in his own abilities...

00:36.614 --> 00:38.579
...and his own ability to deal with life on the tour.

00:38.707 --> 00:39.890
He's just a really calm guy.

00:39.977 --> 00:41.892
He doesn't really get too up or down about too much...

00:41.983 --> 00:44.856
...so I think he brings that personality on to the court.

00:44.965 --> 00:47.654
And he doesn't let the outside distractions get in his own way.

00:47.919 --> 00:49.801
He has shown that he has the game to move forward...

00:49.869 --> 00:51.083
...and to compete with the big boys.

00:51.417 --> 00:53.645
And he's much more of a complete player.

00:54.050 --> 00:56.424
I think he's still very young, only 21 years old...

00:56.585 --> 00:57.968
...but he's got so much potential...

00:58.053 --> 01:00.469
...and I think he demonstrated that loss during the Next Gen finals.

01:00.973 --> 01:03.569
After the Milan, first I got the win,...

01:03.775 --> 01:07.124
...and I played really good in the last few weeks and this week as well.

01:07.204 --> 01:10.302
And I'm just trying to focus on everything.

01:10.734 --> 01:14.292
The first goal is I want to finish the season without injuries...

01:14.408 --> 01:16.940
...because I had a lot of injuries in the last few years.

01:17.071 --> 01:20.691
And the second goal is I want to do everything better than last year.

01:20.907 --> 01:22.460
Now I like to play in the big stage...

01:22.535 --> 01:25.458
...and with the top players while trying to stay calm.

01:25.572 --> 01:27.390
I'm not gonna be scared of anybody anymore.
