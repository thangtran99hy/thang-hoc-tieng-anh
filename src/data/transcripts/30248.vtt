ï»¿These people are standing by Lula da Silva.

00:04.413 --> 00:08.830
They're convinced he will be Brazil's next president despite a court's ruling...

00:09.195 --> 00:11.857
...that makes it almost impossible for him to run.

00:12.856 --> 00:15.750
On Wednesday, an appeals court upheld his conviction...

00:15.874 --> 00:17.511
...for corruption and money laundering.

00:18.224 --> 00:21.444
It even increased the sentence to 12 years and one month.

00:22.376 --> 00:24.292
Lula is now 72.

00:24.591 --> 00:27.131
He was Brazil's first working-class president...

00:27.272 --> 00:30.549
...and is credited with lifting millions out of poverty.

00:31.015 --> 00:35.623
Brazilian law bans candidates who have been convicted from running for office.

00:36.563 --> 00:39.953
There are two legal moves Lula can make to avoid prison...

00:40.335 --> 00:43.097
...and to fight to be allowed to run in October's election.

00:44.595 --> 00:49.625
But for many, that will now be tougher than his supporters would like to admit.
