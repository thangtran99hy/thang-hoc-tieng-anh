00:01.903 --> 00:03.143
ï»¿What are you willing to do...

00:03.209 --> 00:05.785
...and what are you willing to give up to be the best you can be?

00:08.688 --> 00:11.608
You only have so much energy and the clock is ticking on all of us.

00:13.323 --> 00:15.949
If you're gonna compete against me, you better be willing to give up your life...

00:16.274 --> 00:17.543
...because I'm giving up mine.

00:18.687 --> 00:19.119
Brady.

00:19.512 --> 00:20.701
End zone touchdown!

00:20.995 --> 00:21.757
Daddy!

00:22.473 --> 00:24.421
Jay-Z taught us 30 is the new 20...

00:24.493 --> 00:27.504
...and Tom Brady is showing us 40 is the new 30.

00:28.486 --> 00:30.011
There's a warrior spirit about me.

00:31.283 --> 00:33.961
I'm always in competition with myself.

00:35.135 --> 00:38.977
You know, I have to say I don't think I've ever met anyone that loves to do something...

00:39.064 --> 00:40.230
...as much as he loves football.

00:41.789 --> 00:44.368
You don't want to make sacrifices for your sport...

00:44.494 --> 00:46.240
...but when you have a family, you do!

00:48.147 --> 00:49.359
When I see myself out there,...

00:49.439 --> 00:53.687
...I feel like, "Man, I still do this and I do it better than I've ever been..."

00:53.835 --> 00:55.095
"...so why should I stop?"
