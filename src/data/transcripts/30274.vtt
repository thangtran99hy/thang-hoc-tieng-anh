00:12.911 --> 00:17.700
Imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3,000 feet.

00:18.798 --> 00:21.643
Imagine a plane full of smoke.

00:22.725 --> 00:25.543
The pilot had already turned the plane around and we weren't that far.

00:25.932 --> 00:27.022
You could see Manhattan.

00:28.873 --> 00:31.351
The pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River.

00:33.038 --> 00:34.685
And then, he says three words,...

00:34.893 --> 00:37.205
...the most unemotional three words I've ever heard.

00:37.876 --> 00:39.643
He says, "Brace for impact."

00:41.423 --> 00:43.533
I didn't have to talk to the flight attendant anymore.

00:46.755 --> 00:49.063
I could see it in her eyes, it was terror.

00:49.382 --> 00:50.150
Life was over.

00:51.257 --> 00:55.107
Now, I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.

00:56.417 --> 00:58.437
I learned that it all changes in an instant.

00:59.564 --> 01:02.429
I no longer want to postpone anything in life.

01:03.087 --> 01:06.141
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.

01:07.623 --> 01:09.009
The second thing I learned that day,....

01:09.483 --> 01:12.948
...I thought about, "Wow, I really feel one real regret."

01:13.155 --> 01:14.287
I've lived a good life.

01:14.771 --> 01:16.589
In my own humanity and mistakes,...

01:16.659 --> 01:19.089
...I've tried to get better at everything I tried.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.442
And after, as I reflected on that,...

01:21.501 --> 01:23.896
...I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life.

01:24.387 --> 01:26.546
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.

01:26.793 --> 01:27.372
It feels great.

01:27.953 --> 01:31.243
I no longer try to be right. I choose to be happy.

01:33.161 --> 01:38.765
The third thing I learned, I had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary.

01:39.483 --> 01:41.974
It's almost like we've been preparing for it our whole lives.

01:43.049 --> 01:44.443
But it was very sad.

01:44.739 --> 01:46.607
I didn't want to go, I love my life.

01:47.575 --> 01:51.627
And that sadness really framed in one thought,...

01:51.774 --> 01:54.239
...which is, I only wish for one thing.

01:55.164 --> 01:57.019
I only wish I could see my kids grow up.

01:58.830 --> 02:00.858
And it made all the sense in the world to me.

02:01.447 --> 02:05.087
I realized at that point, by connecting those two dots,...

02:05.221 --> 02:08.496
...that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad.

02:09.743 --> 02:14.696
Above all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad.

02:16.141 --> 02:19.749
I was given the gift of a miracle, of not dying that day.

02:20.229 --> 02:24.167
I was given another gift, which was to be able to see into the future...

02:24.620 --> 02:28.041
...and come back and live differently.

02:28.551 --> 02:28.891
Thank you.
