00:12.230 --> 00:15.325
This is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students,...

00:15.446 --> 00:16.610
...cut down to three minutes.

00:16.901 --> 00:20.254
And it all started one day on a plane, on my way to TED, seven years ago.

00:20.612 --> 00:22.481
So I get off the plane, and I come to TED.

00:22.796 --> 00:26.095
So here we are, seven years, 500 interviews later,...

00:26.339 --> 00:30.817
...and I'm going to tell you what really leads to success and makes TEDsters tick.

00:31.223 --> 00:33.013
And the first thing is passion.

00:33.649 --> 00:36.167
Freeman Thomas says, "I'm driven by my passion."

00:36.737 --> 00:38.993
TEDsters do it for love; they don't do it for money.

00:39.755 --> 00:40.172
Work!

00:40.385 --> 00:42.652
Rupert Murdoch said to me, "It's all hard work.

00:42.909 --> 00:44.109
Nothing comes easily.

00:44.319 --> 00:45.432
But I have a lot of fun."

00:46.257 --> 00:46.647
Good!

00:48.162 --> 00:49.939
Alex Garden says, "To be successful,...

00:50.041 --> 00:52.670
...put your nose down in something and get damn good at it."

00:53.029 --> 00:55.489
There's no magic; it's practice, practice, practice.

00:55.895 --> 00:56.530
And it's focus.

00:56.705 --> 00:57.959
Norman Jewison said to me,...

00:58.042 --> 01:01.468
"I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing."

01:02.205 --> 01:02.935
And push!

01:03.678 --> 01:05.262
David Gallo says, "Push yourself.

01:05.618 --> 01:07.969
Physically, mentally, you've got to push, push, push."

01:08.531 --> 01:10.609
You've got to push through shyness and self-doubt.

01:11.163 --> 01:11.911
Serve!

01:13.058 --> 01:16.029
Sherwin Nuland says, "It was a privilege to serve as a doctor."
