ï»¿My name is Julia Pian.

00:02.636 --> 00:04.527
I'm originally from San Diego, California.

00:04.873 --> 00:06.391
I went to Harvard College for undergrad...

00:06.445 --> 00:09.027
...and I'm now a third year medical student at Harvard Medical School.

00:22.611 --> 00:26.957
Typically, I start a day anywhere from 6 to 7:30, I'll wake up...

00:27.304 --> 00:29.248
...and basically head straight into the hospital.

00:29.619 --> 00:32.670
I'll often check on the patients that I'm working with...

00:33.052 --> 00:36.497
...and see how their night went and then I join rounds,...

00:36.628 --> 00:41.635
...which is where we go with a whole team of attendings, resident physicians,...

00:41.773 --> 00:44.029
...as well as medical students, sometimes nurses as well.

00:44.333 --> 00:47.839
We go and we see every patient kind of tell their story...

00:47.959 --> 00:49.689
...and figure out what the plan is for the rest of the day.

00:50.203 --> 00:52.362
The rest of the day kind of varies honestly.

00:52.481 --> 00:54.905
Sometimes, I'll go with the attendings to clinic...

00:55.064 --> 00:57.527
...where I'll see patients in the outpatient setting.

00:57.765 --> 01:01.301
Sometimes, like right now, I'm on my surgery rotation, I'll go to the operating room...

01:01.473 --> 01:03.023
...and see some really interesting cases.

01:03.296 --> 01:06.318
And then sometimes, I'll stay on the floor with the residents...

01:06.452 --> 01:07.970
...and take care of the patients in the hospital,...

01:08.053 --> 01:09.799
...maybe do little procedures there as well.

01:10.613 --> 01:14.016
It really varies what time you get home depending on how busy it is.

01:14.631 --> 01:17.870
But once I'm home, I try and do a mix of studying and relaxing...

01:17.940 --> 01:19.333
...and preparing for the next day.

01:19.615 --> 01:22.521
So maybe I'll start by watching an episode of my favorite TV show...

01:22.605 --> 01:26.431
...and then do a little bit of reading and practice questions for upcoming tests.
