So, I'm 15 years old and I'm opening up a show in Hawaii called the "Magic of Polynesia."

00:10.152 --> 00:15.627
I'm in front of a curtain and I'm singing songs, and my job in that show was to entertain...

00:15.711 --> 00:18.801
...about a thousand people, a thousand tourists from all over the world.

00:19.622 --> 00:23.507
And I would put together a set list like 10 to 12 songs...

00:23.623 --> 00:25.900
...and I'll be honest, I was incredible at 15, I was.

00:29.525 --> 00:34.953
And later on in life, I found out that those songs that I was singing...

00:35.040 --> 00:39.386
...were written by either Babyface, Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis or Teddy Riley.

00:41.928 --> 00:44.779
And with those songs, I remember singing it.

00:44.865 --> 00:46.909
I remember singing it firsthand, people dancing...

00:47.000 --> 00:49.110
...that have never met each other from two sides of the globe;...

00:49.447 --> 00:53.114
...dancing with each other, toasting with each other, celebrating together.

00:53.694 --> 00:56.197
All I wanted to do with this album was that...

00:56.434 --> 00:59.313
...and you know, those songs were written with nothing but joy.

00:59.733 --> 01:00.687
And for one reason,...

01:00.768 --> 01:01.973
...and for one reason only and that's love,...

01:02.091 --> 01:05.417
...and that's all I wanted to bring with this album, and hopefully I could feel that again...

01:05.480 --> 01:07.630
...and see everybody dancing and everybody moving.
