ï»¿Baseball can be of a great benefit to the players.

00:05.481 --> 00:07.567
Baseball teaches team-building skills.

00:09.039 --> 00:12.042
All players must work together to accomplish the goal of scoring...

00:12.116 --> 00:13.905
...and keeping the other team from scoring.

00:14.786 --> 00:16.108
It teaches good sportsmanship.

00:16.673 --> 00:18.465
Players must be courteous to each other.

00:19.343 --> 00:22.429
Baseball is also great for developing hand-eye coordination.

00:23.033 --> 00:25.435
Swinging the bat and making contact with the ball...

00:25.523 --> 00:27.289
...is a lot more difficult than it sounds.

00:27.839 --> 00:29.642
It takes timing and precision,...

00:30.037 --> 00:33.093
...two skills that become better with hand-eye coordination.

00:34.292 --> 00:36.488
Baseball also promotes exercise.

00:37.097 --> 00:39.293
And overall, baseball is just fun.

00:40.437 --> 00:42.350
Who knows, with a little practice,..

00:42.793 --> 00:44.907
...anyone can be in the major leagues one day...

00:45.097 --> 00:47.045
...with a multimillion dollar contract.
