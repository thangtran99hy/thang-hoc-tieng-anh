00:00.866 --> 00:04.190
The first onigirazu I'm going to prepare is tuna mayonnaise.

00:04.815 --> 00:07.933
Start by putting one whole can of tuna into a bowl.

00:08.895 --> 00:10.730
This will give you around two servings.

00:11.143 --> 00:13.152
Season with salt and black pepper.

00:14.087 --> 00:18.933
Add a generous amount of mayonnaise, some lemon juice...

00:19.407 --> 00:22.327
...and around three tablespoons of finely-chopped onions.

00:22.935 --> 00:23.919
Give it a good mix.

00:26.042 --> 00:29.193
The principles behind all of the onigirazu will be the same.

00:30.641 --> 00:34.191
Start by placing a sheet of cling film onto a chopping board.

00:35.574 --> 00:37.892
Take one roasted nori seaweed sheet.

00:38.384 --> 00:41.244
They will usually have one side which has a rougher texture...

00:41.616 --> 00:44.323
...and the other side with a shinier and smoother texture.

00:44.590 --> 00:49.335
When making sushi rolls or onigirazu, ensure that the rough side is facing up.

00:49.805 --> 00:52.663
This is so that the smoother, aesthetically pleasing side...

00:52.926 --> 00:55.245
...is visible on the  outside of the onigirazu.

00:56.695 --> 00:59.827
Place some warm steamed rice in the center of the nori sheet,...

01:00.783 --> 01:04.580
...season with salt, place some lettuce...

01:04.779 --> 01:06.571
...and cucumber on top of the rice,...

01:08.443 --> 01:09.997
...followed by the tuna mayonnaise.

01:12.785 --> 01:14.384
Then, top off with some more rice.

01:15.261 --> 01:16.787
Season again with some salt.

01:19.779 --> 01:22.477
Next, fold in the edges to create a parcel.

01:23.179 --> 01:25.263
It's important not to squeeze too hard...

01:25.624 --> 01:29.018
...as you'll end up with a really dense and unpleasant texture when eating.

01:31.511 --> 01:34.183
Finally, wrap the onigirazu with the cling film.

01:35.487 --> 01:38.783
Reshape and allow to rest on the side for a few minutes,...

01:39.359 --> 01:43.199
...enough time for the edges of the nori to stick together to form a parcel.
