00:00.579 --> 00:04.620
ï»¿Like most Olympic athletes, I began sports at an early age.

00:05.048 --> 00:09.614
Ten years ago when Pyeongchang begin its dream to host the Winter games,...

00:09.969 --> 00:15.319
...I was a young girl beginning my own Olympic dream in an ice rink in Seoul.

00:15.451 --> 00:19.878
Figure skating can be a lonely sport with hours and hours of practice...

00:20.015 --> 00:24.170
...without a teammate to push you, to cheer for you when you succeed...

00:24.446 --> 00:26.262
...or pick you up when you fall.

00:26.861 --> 00:30.121
But my dream of an Olympic gold medal kept me going.

00:31.216 --> 00:34.950
Our government began an ongoing program called "Drive the Dream"...

00:35.337 --> 00:36.969
...to promote winter sports...

00:37.279 --> 00:41.041
...and to improve the performance of young winter sport athletes.

00:41.427 --> 00:43.229
I was one of those athletes.

00:43.916 --> 00:48.827
Through the efforts of this program, Korea won 14 medals in Vancouver...

00:48.995 --> 00:49.764
...including mine.

00:50.668 --> 00:56.494
So you see, in a very real way, without the continued effort of our past two bids,...

00:56.651 --> 01:00.049
...I may not  have had an opportunity to be an Olympic champion.
