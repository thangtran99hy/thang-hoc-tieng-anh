ï»¿When I was young, Michelle Kwan was my hero.

00:11.485 --> 00:15.775
After I first watched her skating in the 1998 Nagano Olympics,...

00:16.119 --> 00:17.692
...I fell in love with her skating.

00:20.606 --> 00:23.526
When I first met her, I was very excited.

00:23.767 --> 00:28.693
But after that, I had a few chances to skate with her.

00:29.273 --> 00:32.246
I've done  a duet number with her.

00:32.930 --> 00:34.553
I was very honored.

00:37.601 --> 00:42.938
I've been training in Michelle's rink so we're like friends.

00:43.081 --> 00:46.095
It's very cool to be friends with my hero.

00:47.735 --> 00:55.306
I hope I can be a skater who can captivate the audiences' eyes and mind...

00:55.537 --> 00:56.157
...just like her.

01:01.777 --> 01:05.085
I think it's very important to help a lot of children in the world.

01:06.017 --> 01:09.617
I'm very happy to be a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador...

01:10.139 --> 01:12.004
...and I hope I can inspire them.
