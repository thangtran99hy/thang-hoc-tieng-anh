00:01.090 --> 00:03.737
Let us start with just a basic question, Mark.

00:03.840 --> 00:04.735
What happened?

00:04.925 --> 00:05.613
What went wrong?

00:05.989 --> 00:10.833
So, this was a major breach of trust and I'm really sorry that this happened.

00:11.697 --> 00:14.729
We have a basic responsibility to protect people's data.

00:14.894 --> 00:19.455
And if we can't do that, then we don't deserve to have the opportunity to serve people.

00:20.237 --> 00:24.335
So, our responsibility now is to make sure that this doesn't happen again.
