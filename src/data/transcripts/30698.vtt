00:02.801 --> 00:06.423
As graduating students of the Stanford University Computer Science Department,...

00:06.639 --> 00:08.573
...you have a magnificent foundation.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.498
The guy is a fascist monopolist.

00:11.946 --> 00:14.216
The guy knows how to get people's attention.

00:14.279 --> 00:15.126
He does what he does!

00:16.915 --> 00:17.241
Hello.

00:17.469 --> 00:17.858
Milo?

00:18.447 --> 00:19.425
This is Gary Winston.

00:19.683 --> 00:21.107
I heard great things about your work.

00:21.270 --> 00:23.872
Okay, I don't know who this is, but your timing really blows...

00:23.947 --> 00:25.408
...because I just saw him on a live chat.

00:25.592 --> 00:27.963
Well, I'd love to show you some of the things we are doing here.

00:29.098 --> 00:29.673
Who was it?

00:31.419 --> 00:34.315
You are one of maybe 20 programmers with the mastery,...

00:34.409 --> 00:35.743
...that's gonna take to change the world.

00:35.981 --> 00:36.742
You gotta see this.

00:36.935 --> 00:37.857
Digital canvas.

00:37.985 --> 00:39.355
Doesn't Bill Gates have something like that?

00:39.805 --> 00:40.230
Bill who?

00:41.313 --> 00:43.099
What would you do with a billion dollars, Milo?

00:43.195 --> 00:43.873
What do you think?

00:43.998 --> 00:45.473
I think we should sleep on it.

00:48.528 --> 00:51.709
This is the technology that will fuel business for the next 30 years.

00:51.811 --> 00:53.491
Can you get this done on time to meet your date?

00:53.864 --> 00:54.457
With you, I can.

00:54.731 --> 00:55.695
You're pretty famous around here.

00:56.057 --> 00:57.011
To genuises.

00:57.586 --> 00:58.444
I'm Lisa, by the way.

00:59.153 --> 01:00.841
He's buying up pretty much everything.

01:00.996 --> 01:02.914
Cable companies, baby bells,...

01:03.008 --> 01:03.775
Check this out.

01:03.920 --> 01:04.261
This is amazing!

01:04.351 --> 01:05.373
Who's doing all this?

01:05.497 --> 01:05.999
Somebody, yeah.

01:06.372 --> 01:08.742
Every time I get jammed up, Gary comes up with something.

01:10.217 --> 01:10.793
Are you okay?

01:10.963 --> 01:11.193
No!

01:11.788 --> 01:14.379
I keep my journal right next to my bed; a week ago it disappeared.

01:14.467 --> 01:15.587
Doesn't it seem kind of strange?

01:17.245 --> 01:18.727
I think it's part of a camera.

01:18.930 --> 01:20.200
We need to tell you something.

01:23.979 --> 01:24.771
Teddy's been killed.

01:25.467 --> 01:27.077
Teddy was onto something very specific.

01:27.283 --> 01:28.389
There's got to be a connection, Alice.

01:28.476 --> 01:29.052
I can feel it!

01:29.219 --> 01:29.631
Hey, Milo.

01:31.179 --> 01:33.368
He said any kid working in his garage can put him out of business.

01:33.559 --> 01:34.939
It's almost like you know what every kid is doing.

01:35.023 --> 01:36.811
He's building this network of satellites.

01:37.662 --> 01:38.879
You seem kind of jumpy, Milo.

01:38.985 --> 01:39.275
Hurry up!

01:40.588 --> 01:41.939
You're not losing your hold on him, are you?

01:42.029 --> 01:44.307
Why don't you just do something about that girl, Lisa?

01:44.428 --> 01:45.361
We got our eyes on her.

01:45.444 --> 01:47.723
The guys invested billions on getting there first, he'll do anything.

01:50.932 --> 01:52.709
It's a cutthroat business we're in, Milo.

01:52.804 --> 01:55.251
How do you let go of a secret without telling the wrong person?

01:55.436 --> 01:56.399
Who knows who they are paying?

01:56.635 --> 01:58.211
There's something I need to tell you.

01:58.390 --> 02:01.035
A good chess player always knows his opponent's moves before he makes them.

02:01.136 --> 02:02.127
You know how his mind works.

02:02.287 --> 02:03.473
He's gone way too far already.

02:03.545 --> 02:06.193
In the real world, when you kill people, they die.

02:06.283 --> 02:07.109
This isn't a game!

02:12.528 --> 02:13.952
I know what you're doing, Milo.

02:15.248 --> 02:17.768
I just want to know that it's not affecting your work.
