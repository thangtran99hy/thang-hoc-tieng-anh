00:00.673 --> 00:02.954
Norway is one of the most unique, incredible,...

00:03.039 --> 00:04.573
...rugged countries in the whole world.

00:05.153 --> 00:07.925
The first location is the Nigardsbreen Glacier.

00:11.059 --> 00:14.394
This glacier lies about 19 miles north of the village Gaupne.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.019
The Nigardsbreen Glacier...

00:16.105 --> 00:19.685
...is actually an arm of the largest glacier in Continental Europe...

00:19.827 --> 00:22.155
...called the Jostedalsbreen Glacier.

00:22.361 --> 00:26.597
To get to the glacier, a small boat will transport you to the base...

00:26.689 --> 00:30.773
...where you'll cross the palest,  most turquoise blue glacier water...

00:30.840 --> 00:33.533
...you have ever seen in your whole life.

00:33.803 --> 00:35.705
From the forest to the base of the glacier,...

00:35.790 --> 00:37.437
...you have about a 30-minute hike.

00:41.501 --> 00:43.347
Once you get to the base of the glacier,...

00:43.426 --> 00:47.485
...you're kitted out with crampons and ice picks and a harness.

00:47.571 --> 00:49.814
It is impossible to climb ice without crampons...

00:49.921 --> 00:51.479
...and they actually come with the guide...

00:51.771 --> 00:53.626
...and I'll have all that information down below.

00:53.887 --> 00:54.894
Once you start climbing,...

00:54.967 --> 00:58.036
...it's about eight hours in total from the top to the bottom.

00:58.224 --> 01:00.325
This glacier hike was one of, if not,...

01:00.447 --> 01:03.601
...the most defining travel experience I've had in my whole life.

01:03.927 --> 01:04.913
It's one thing to see it,...

01:05.036 --> 01:09.397
...but to actually hear the pieces of ice the size of buildings...

01:09.538 --> 01:13.097
...moving and breaking and it felt like a living thing,...

01:13.177 --> 01:15.999
...this massive, massive, living thing.
