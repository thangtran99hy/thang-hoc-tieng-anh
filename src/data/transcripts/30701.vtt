The next location is Langfossen Falls, which translates to "long waterfall."

00:06.534 --> 00:10.097
This waterfall is less of an activity and more of just an attraction.

00:10.205 --> 00:11.859
I mean, you're driving down the highway,...

00:12.242 --> 00:14.019
...out of nowhere, you hear this noise,...

00:14.099 --> 00:16.481
...this rumbling noise, then you see the mist.

00:16.546 --> 00:19.415
You turn the corner and you see the largest,...

00:19.521 --> 00:22.463
...most menacing waterfall on Earth.

00:22.535 --> 00:26.269
This waterfall is over 2,000 feet high.

00:26.392 --> 00:29.839
The World Waterfall Database declared this waterfall...

00:30.121 --> 00:32.327
...to be one of the best in the world.

00:32.567 --> 00:33.389
That's got to tell you something.

00:33.555 --> 00:35.939
I drove past this waterfall on my way to Voss,...

00:36.022 --> 00:37.919
...where I did some whitewater river kayaking.

00:38.059 --> 00:41.247
Langfossen is the perfect place if you're on a long road trip in Norway...

00:41.331 --> 00:43.819
...to just pull over to the side of the road, have some food,...

00:43.887 --> 00:47.555
...enjoy the beauty and just kind of take it in because it is quite the sight.
