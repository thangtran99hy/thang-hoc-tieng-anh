00:05.253 --> 00:09.731
Yeah, this very, very long Norwegian word translates to "Atlantic Ocean Road."

00:09.828 --> 00:13.833
Now, it is known as the world's most dangerous road just because during the wintertime,...

00:13.939 --> 00:16.235
...there are very strong storms that go through this area.

00:19.806 --> 00:22.007

...so I didn't get to experience it in the storm and the craziness,...

00:25.134 --> 00:27.867

00:48.301 --> 00:50.405
...which brings us to our next location.
