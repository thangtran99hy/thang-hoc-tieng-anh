00:00.117 --> 00:03.967
Deep in the mountains of western Norway lies Trollstigen Road.

00:04.281 --> 00:08.079
Trollstigen translates directly to "troll's ladder".

00:08.311 --> 00:10.807
Trollstigen is a visual feast.

00:10.912 --> 00:13.485
I have never seen a place that was so...

00:14.159 --> 00:15.610
One, it makes your stomach drop.

00:15.701 --> 00:18.386
It is a straight cliff drop down to the valley.

00:18.473 --> 00:22.214
This road is the hardest and the highest bike climb in the entire world.

00:22.304 --> 00:28.347
12.2 kilometers of this ride is at a grueling seven percent incline.

00:28.439 --> 00:30.054
The view from the top is just...

00:30.142 --> 00:32.254
You can't even put into words how breathtaking...

00:32.332 --> 00:35.565
...and just vast this view is off into the distance.

00:36.043 --> 00:39.357
Norway is hands-down the most extreme  place I've ever been.

00:39.624 --> 00:41.066
The landscape is just...

00:41.486 --> 00:42.191
Look at this!

00:42.982 --> 00:45.533
There were certain points where I hit 60 kilometers per hour.

00:45.619 --> 00:48.150
I cannot highly recommend enough going to this place.

00:48.242 --> 00:50.934
It is breathtaking in every aspect of the word.

00:51.271 --> 00:54.107
Literally, it will take your breath away especially if you're biking up it...

00:54.382 --> 00:57.091
...or you're biking down, Trollstigen Road is a must...

00:57.151 --> 00:58.869
...if you're going to northwestern Norway.

00:58.973 --> 01:00.274
You have to see this place.
