00:00.685 --> 00:05.991
ï»¿The next location on our list, I have never seen anything like this.

00:06.063 --> 00:08.666
It is something out of a novel or a film.

00:08.813 --> 00:11.221
What I'm about to show you will blow your mind.

00:11.475 --> 00:15.882
The next location and probably the most interesting place on this list...

00:16.047 --> 00:18.926
...is the world's strongest whirlpool.

00:23.788 --> 00:29.546
Located in the Nordland, this is the strongest tidal current in the entire world.

00:29.665 --> 00:33.680
These whirlpools were so large that they could swallow boats.

00:33.909 --> 00:35.779
If we were to get close enough to the whirlpool,...

00:36.036 --> 00:38.875
...you could actually feel it dragging the boat into it.

00:38.980 --> 00:43.283
Up to 400 million tons of seawater forced their way...

00:43.413 --> 00:47.895
...through a three-kilometer long and only 150-meter wide strait...

00:48.061 --> 00:50.307
...every six hours with the tides.

00:50.391 --> 00:55.877
Water speeds reach 37 kilometers per hour at the peak of the whirlpool.

00:56.011 --> 00:58.231
But no really, I've never seen currents this fast.

00:58.610 --> 01:01.238
And there's actually whirlpools, like when you flush a toilet,...

01:01.493 --> 01:03.788
...that's what we have except times a thousand.

01:04.479 --> 01:05.031
So, let's go!

01:05.109 --> 01:05.898
And no poop.

01:06.045 --> 01:07.899
The whirlpools themselves are huge.

01:08.123 --> 01:10.171
Some can be up to ten meters in diameter...

01:10.315 --> 01:14.158
...and reach five meters deep in the heart of the vortex.

01:14.351 --> 01:15.945
Five meters deep!

01:16.179 --> 01:19.027
Now, on the day that I was there, they were not nearly that big...

01:19.306 --> 01:23.910
...but I couldn't even imagine seeing a whirlpool that big and that powerful...

01:24.009 --> 01:25.383
...because they do get that big.
