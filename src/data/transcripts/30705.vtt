00:00.092 --> 00:02.281
Rounding out the list of incredible things...

00:02.339 --> 00:05.161
...and places in Norway is the Midnight Sun.

00:05.348 --> 00:07.843
The strangest thing was watching the sun go down...

00:07.907 --> 00:10.212
...and having it just hover right above the horizon.

00:10.561 --> 00:12.117
It would set at about midnight,...

00:12.439 --> 00:13.375
...just kind of hang there,...

00:13.699 --> 00:15.233
...and then it would start to rise at 1:00 AM.

00:15.351 --> 00:17.597
The Midnight Sun is a natural phenomenon...

00:17.765 --> 00:21.389
...that occurs in the summer months in places north of the Arctic Circle.

00:21.467 --> 00:25.731
But actually, the Midnight Sun can occur almost 50 miles away from the circle...

00:26.048 --> 00:27.193
...but not quite as high.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.251
Your body clock is so thrown out of whack...

00:29.375 --> 00:32.961
...because, imagine, you are as tired as can be but it is light out.

00:33.080 --> 00:35.533
It's the strangest, just most bizarre thing.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.946
It's very hard to sleep in Norway.

00:38.323 --> 00:41.169
It is right now 12:30 in the morning.

00:41.235 --> 00:43.811
It's June the 11th so it's almost the first day of summer,...

00:43.883 --> 00:45.069
...which is the longest day of the year.

00:45.135 --> 00:48.687
I haven't been sleeping the past two days just because it doesn't get dark.

00:48.774 --> 00:49.713
It's always light out.

00:49.791 --> 00:50.758
I mean, look at this.

00:50.839 --> 00:53.597
The sun just dips down low enough below the horizon,...

00:53.699 --> 00:55.831
...where it's like a sunset for two hours straight,...

00:55.904 --> 00:59.507
...and then it pops right back up at about 2:00, maybe 1:45.

00:59.611 --> 01:00.834
Real strange but kind of cool.
