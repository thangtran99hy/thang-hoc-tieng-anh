00:05.440 --> 00:08.353
I said it earlier like, I'm a little bit surprised...

00:08.856 --> 00:12.396
...and very grateful just to be in the mix with players.

00:12.497 --> 00:17.313
They were nominated and all of those players had great seasons.

00:17.383 --> 00:19.929
So yeah, I'm a little bit surprised but to win it back-to-back...

00:20.805 --> 00:22.407
You know, I'm hugely grateful just to be...

00:22.673 --> 00:24.949
...part of an awesome All Blacks team...

00:25.695 --> 00:28.074
...because I'm only a small part of that team...

00:28.190 --> 00:30.241
...and here I am, getting the credit for it.

00:30.892 --> 00:32.781
It's been a challenging year for us...

00:34.426 --> 00:39.227
...more than one way, one of injuries, and also being tested on the field...

00:39.489 --> 00:40.737
We saw that in the line series...

00:40.835 --> 00:43.116
...and you know, we've learned so much from there,...

00:43.184 --> 00:47.159
...which is great and we'll sort of take that into the next couple of years,...

00:47.331 --> 00:48.488
...getting to the World Cup.

00:50.535 --> 00:54.713
We know that we have to keep finding ways to improve...

00:54.814 --> 01:00.353
...and I guess develop our game so it's less predictable at times.

01:01.086 --> 01:06.183
So, that's exciting because we've got great talent and a great team culture...

01:06.988 --> 01:09.421
...but the game of rugby is always changing.
