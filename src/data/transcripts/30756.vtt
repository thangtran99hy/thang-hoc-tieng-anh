I started Facebook.

00:02.377 --> 00:05.485
I run it and I'm responsible for what happens here.

00:08.028 --> 00:11.846
ï»¿How do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?

00:14.379 --> 00:15.629
Senator, we run ads.

00:20.713 --> 00:25.555
Here's what everybody's been trying to tell you today, and I say this gently:...

00:27.111 --> 00:29.290
...Your user agreement sucks.

00:32.307 --> 00:35.849
The purpose of that user agreement is to cover Facebook's rear end.

00:36.841 --> 00:39.883
It's not to inform your users about their rights.

00:40.667 --> 00:43.434
Now, you know that and I know that.

00:47.167 --> 00:48.465
We don't sell data at all.

00:49.309 --> 00:54.708
But this is widely mischaracterized about our system,...

00:55.073 --> 00:56.345
...that we sell data...

00:56.743 --> 00:59.282
...and it's actually one of the most important parts of how Facebook works...

00:59.375 --> 01:00.279
...is we do not sell data.

01:00.357 --> 01:02.980
Advertisers do not get access to people's individual data.
