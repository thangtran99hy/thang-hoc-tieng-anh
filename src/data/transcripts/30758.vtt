ï»¿I'm not very comfortable in  answering these specific questions about the case.

00:04.471 --> 00:08.437
But let me just say this.

00:09.080 --> 00:13.424
I received an order from the appeals court ordering the arrest.

00:13.745 --> 00:19.539
So, I just complied with the order.

00:20.739 --> 00:24.321
I don't have the choice to not comply with the order.

00:24.616 --> 00:24.839
Right.

00:24.949 --> 00:27.905
So, you felt you had no choice but to move quickly.

00:28.546 --> 00:33.483
Oh well, I think he was convicted for money laundering and corruption.

00:34.070 --> 00:37.299
And you have to enforce the judgement.

00:38.302 --> 00:39.427
It's as simple as that.

00:41.647 --> 00:46.150
I don't see any specific reason to postpone it anymore.
