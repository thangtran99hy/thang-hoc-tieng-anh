ï»¿I think people underestimate how hard it is to untangle ourselves...

00:03.906 --> 00:06.124
...from a social network like Facebook.

00:08.181 --> 00:09.935
So, before you delete your Facebook account,...

00:10.027 --> 00:13.538
...just remember that it's not just Facebook that you'll be losing access to.

00:13.811 --> 00:19.075
It's also all of the third-party apps that you use Facebook to log in to...

00:19.148 --> 00:21.889
...or that are connected or plugged into your Facebook account.

00:22.285 --> 00:26.423
So, it's important before you make this choice to go through those apps,...

00:26.519 --> 00:28.735
...see which ones you still need access to,...

00:28.932 --> 00:33.092
...and if there are any, to switch your login from Facebook to something else...

00:33.503 --> 00:36.845
...so you can still access it even after you've deleted your Facebook account.

00:37.112 --> 00:39.792
And there are just some apps that you won't have access to...

00:39.879 --> 00:41.203
...if you delete your Facebook account.

00:44.445 --> 00:48.713
Facebook has a lot of ways to track your activity even if you're not logged in...

00:48.791 --> 00:51.033
...or if you delete your account entirely,...

00:51.440 --> 00:54.765
...and it uses what it calls the social graph...

00:54.857 --> 01:00.349
...to track the activity of people across the internet beyond just Facebook.com.

01:01.013 --> 01:03.875
This accounts for everyone who uses the internet,...

01:03.989 --> 01:08.205
...and you don't have to have a Facebook profile to be tracked by Facebook.

01:08.383 --> 01:13.841
For example, if your friends have Facebook accounts or Facebook Messenger accounts...

01:14.093 --> 01:17.272
...and if they've uploaded their contacts to Facebook...

01:17.603 --> 01:19.344
...and if you're one of their contacts,...

01:19.443 --> 01:23.794
...then Facebook knows your name and your phone number and can track you.
