ï»¿Japanese researchers have found more than 16 million tons of rare earth deposits...

00:05.849 --> 00:08.567
...under the seabed near the island of Minami-tori-shima,...

00:08.811 --> 00:11.688
...some 1800 kilometers from the country's mainland.

00:12.078 --> 00:15.311
Rare earths include dozens of minerals used in high-tech products,...

00:15.401 --> 00:17.659
...from smartphones to electric vehicles.

00:18.069 --> 00:21.781
According to the study released on Tuesday in the journal Scientific Reports,...

00:22.049 --> 00:26.234
...the researchers collected samples of the elements in 25 locations on the seabed...

00:26.386 --> 00:28.961
...across a 2500 square kilometer area.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.763
The analysis found 730 years' worth of dysprosium,...

00:32.966 --> 00:34.855
...used for the magnets in hybrid cars,...

00:35.111 --> 00:39.351
...and 780 years' worth of yttrium, used in the manufacture of lasers,...

00:39.577 --> 00:40.986
...based on estimated demand.

00:41.415 --> 00:45.045
The discovery of the deposits could help ease the world's dependence on China,...

00:45.277 --> 00:48.577
...which accounts for nearly 90 percent of all rare earths production.

00:49.107 --> 00:53.358
Beijing's dominant position has resulted in price spikes and shortages in the past.

00:53.715 --> 00:56.460
The researchers say they have also come up with the technology...

00:56.544 --> 00:59.095
...to allow the resources to be extracted efficiently.

00:59.384 --> 01:03.667
The researchers plan to work with private companies to recover the rare earth minerals.
