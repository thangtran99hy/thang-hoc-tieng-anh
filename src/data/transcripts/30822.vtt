00:00.050 --> 00:03.793
In the 1930s, the Dassler brothers' sport shoe company in Bavaria...

00:03.939 --> 00:07.059
...made the most kick-ass athletic shoes in all the land.

00:07.475 --> 00:12.024
The company even gave Jesse Owens a pair of shoes to compete in the 36th Olympics.

00:12.498 --> 00:15.432
When Jesse won, the brothers' shoes blew up.

00:16.049 --> 00:18.724
But all of that success was not good for their relationship.

00:19.047 --> 00:20.103
Tensions flared.

00:20.317 --> 00:23.570
Some say there was stealing, affairs, resentment...

00:23.991 --> 00:27.992
...and after World War II, the brothers were so out of step,...

00:28.100 --> 00:29.907
...they eventually ended the company.

00:30.791 --> 00:36.964
In 1949, Adolf or Adi Dassler formed Adidas, a play on his nickname.

00:37.164 --> 00:42.083
Rudolf Dassler started Puma because, well, that name is awesome.

00:42.781 --> 00:46.295
The brothers sued each other many, many times over the years...

00:46.462 --> 00:49.442
...over all sorts of design and trademark issues,...

00:49.745 --> 00:53.826
...costing each other a fortune in lawyers and suits.

00:54.109 --> 00:57.966
Their two factories built in the same Bavarian village of Herzogenaurach...

00:58.330 --> 01:02.274
...polarized the community with local people picking sides by picking shoes.

01:02.809 --> 01:04.627
The brothers died two years apart.

01:04.828 --> 01:07.968
They are buried at opposite ends of the village graveyard,...

01:08.126 --> 01:12.118
...proof that even in death there remained a great bitter divide between them.

01:12.863 --> 01:16.281
And so it was for decades until 2009.

01:16.913 --> 01:18.932
Employees of Adidas and Puma...

01:19.092 --> 01:22.788
...in the village where the two companies still have their headquarters came together...

01:23.203 --> 01:25.017
...and played a friendly soccer match...

01:25.169 --> 01:28.354
...and started the process of healing decades of enmity...

01:28.549 --> 01:32.276
...and began a new era of love and shoes.
