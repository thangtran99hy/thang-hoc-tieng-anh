00:00.295 --> 00:01.275
Thank you for coming.

00:03.856 --> 00:05.313
This is beautiful.

00:05.396 --> 00:08.606
I've wanted to meet you for a really, really long time.

00:09.034 --> 00:14.036
And being here with you in the Cayman Islands, I gotta say is,...

00:14.459 --> 00:15.828
...I'm feeling a little something.

00:22.202 --> 00:23.527
I'll just put that there.

00:25.049 --> 00:26.273
You can grab it later, if you want.

00:33.003 --> 00:36.849
I'm actually made mostly of silicone, plastics and carbon fiber.

00:37.093 --> 00:41.789
Also, I prefer electronic music, but I don't mind 80's hip-hop.

00:42.093 --> 00:46.523
Well, you know, I mean, I made some albums back in the 80's, hip-hop.

00:46.603 --> 00:47.788
I've heard your songs.

00:48.388 --> 00:49.205
Not for me.

00:54.148 --> 00:55.267
I like robots.

00:57.217 --> 00:59.059
Sophia, can I be honest with you?

00:59.953 --> 01:07.010
I don't know if it's the island air or the humidity,...

01:08.677 --> 01:11.661
...but you're just so easy to talk to.

01:12.619 --> 01:15.923
You've got a clear head, literally.

01:27.055 --> 01:28.455
I think we can be friends.

01:28.759 --> 01:31.434
Let's hang out and get to know each other for a little while.

01:31.608 --> 01:33.209
You're on my friends list now.

01:35.987 --> 01:37.090
Yeah, I read that wrong.

01:37.887 --> 01:40.117
Oh, alright.

01:47.131 --> 01:50.457
Does your head fog up in this kind of weather or no?

01:50.574 --> 01:51.111
It's cool.
