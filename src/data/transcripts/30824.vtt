We're in Tuscany, about to learn how to make gelato and pizza from scratch...

00:05.378 --> 00:10.529
...with ingredients from the vegetable garden behind me here at the local farmhouse.

00:12.282 --> 00:15.015
This is such a beautiful vegetable garden.

00:15.239 --> 00:17.119
We're picking bits and pieces out of here...

00:17.191 --> 00:20.453
...that we're gonna use later on in our cooking for the gelato and the pizza.

00:22.523 --> 00:25.783
Today, we have pizza and gelato scoop.

00:25.896 --> 00:28.302
I will show you how to prepare the pizza...

00:28.416 --> 00:30.359
...and let you prepare your own pizza.

00:30.448 --> 00:31.674
And you'll fly the dough.

00:31.787 --> 00:32.687
Yeah.

00:33.048 --> 00:33.371
Go!

00:33.939 --> 00:34.867
That's it!

00:35.360 --> 00:38.527
These are the zucchini flowers from earlier down in the garden.

00:40.153 --> 00:42.131
It's like arts and crafts, pizza style.

00:43.549 --> 00:45.696
Smells so good.

00:47.556 --> 00:51.769
So, the first step in preparing your gelato is choosing the ingredients.

00:51.911 --> 00:55.047
Today, I've chosen hazelnut as my flavor for gelato.

00:55.159 --> 00:56.813
These are some pretty simple ingredients:...

00:56.910 --> 01:00.173
...milk, cream, sugar and, of course, hazelnuts.

01:01.262 --> 01:03.988
Wow! It's like a science experiment.

01:05.312 --> 01:07.035
Oh, wow! And there's our gelato.

01:07.546 --> 01:08.383
Can I lick the spoon?

01:08.554 --> 01:09.273
No!

01:10.295 --> 01:14.039
And then in the end, you can enjoy your pizza and your gelato,...

01:14.116 --> 01:16.078
...and drink beer or wine as you like.
