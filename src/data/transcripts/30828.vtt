It is hard to believe that the waste in this landfill...

00:04.139 --> 00:07.342
...could be used to make items like garbage cans and chairs,...

00:07.881 --> 00:14.057
...but an Israeli company called UBQ is doing just that and has patented a process...

00:14.401 --> 00:18.387
...to convert household trash into a reusable composite material.

00:18.743 --> 00:20.975
So what you're looking at here might look like garbage,...

00:21.522 --> 00:26.741
...but what we do is we convert it, so we can convert it into a chair, a table,...

00:27.099 --> 00:28.738
...a trash can, a flower pot.

00:28.914 --> 00:31.703
The company uses trash that is not recycled.

00:32.055 --> 00:35.433
It involves all your food leftovers, the banana peels,...

00:35.756 --> 00:37.155
...the chicken bones and the hamburger.

00:37.723 --> 00:41.088
The dirty plastics, the dirty cartons, the dirty papers,...

00:41.591 --> 00:43.673
...everything is in this material.

00:44.013 --> 00:44.724
We have dried it.

00:45.137 --> 00:45.858
We have grounded it...

00:46.319 --> 00:50.277
...and we have converted it with a revolutionary patented technology.

00:50.501 --> 00:53.457
The garbage is ground down and made into pellets...

00:53.791 --> 00:57.301
...that other companies can use to produce the composite items.

00:57.451 --> 00:59.725
They can actually use the equipment they have,...

01:00.052 --> 01:01.659
...make the products that they already make,...

01:02.013 --> 01:05.757
...only that now they'll be using UBQ material instead of plastic.

01:06.050 --> 01:11.506
UBQ hopes its innovation will help revolutionize waste management worldwide.
