Inflation is the overall rise in prices of goods and services in an economy.

00:05.486 --> 00:06.164
Here's Claire.

00:06.756 --> 00:09.322
Claire heads over to the corner store to buy a pack of gum.

00:09.878 --> 00:12.135
That pack of gum cost Claire one dollar.

00:12.722 --> 00:16.141
Fast-forward a year and Claire heads to the exact same corner store...

00:16.287 --> 00:18.105
...and buys the exact same pack of gum.

00:18.597 --> 00:22.169
This time though, the pack of gum cost Claire one dollar and two cents.

00:22.813 --> 00:25.559
That two percent rise in the price of the gum is inflation.

00:26.204 --> 00:30.403
Inflation causes a rise in prices and also causes the value of your money,...

00:30.603 --> 00:32.783
...known as purchasing power, to decrease.

00:33.269 --> 00:36.749
Claire's one dollar is worth less today than it did last year.

00:37.420 --> 00:40.732
In general, the demand for goods and services in an economy...

00:41.026 --> 00:45.303
...is greater than the supply, causing prices to rise and therefore inflation.
