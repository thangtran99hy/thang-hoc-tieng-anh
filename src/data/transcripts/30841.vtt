ï»¿Most people know that Facebook has information about them.

00:03.678 --> 00:08.369
We submit things like our names, our hometowns, our ages,...

00:08.443 --> 00:10.697
...our birthdays and our interests,...

00:10.781 --> 00:13.423
...and we assume that Facebook is collecting that data.

00:13.506 --> 00:18.472
But Facebook has much more data on most people than they realize.

00:21.790 --> 00:23.804
Facebook can take all the data that you submit...

00:23.901 --> 00:26.003
...and combine it with data from other users...

00:26.209 --> 00:29.069
...and outside information to construct a profile of you.

00:29.467 --> 00:32.181
Facebook uses nearly 100 different data points...

00:32.284 --> 00:34.959
...to classify your interests and activities.

00:35.421 --> 00:38.158
This would include basic stuff like your age and gender,...

00:38.387 --> 00:42.224
...but also more complicated information like whether you own a motorcycle...

00:42.327 --> 00:45.714
...or you recently went on vacation or whether you're a gadget geek.

00:46.067 --> 00:49.847
Researchers have found that by using signals such as your likes and interactions,...

00:50.163 --> 00:54.200
...Facebook could tell if you were in a relationship or going through a breakup.

00:56.209 --> 00:58.351
Facebook doesn't just know who you are.

00:58.430 --> 01:00.103
It also knows where you are.

01:00.409 --> 01:02.712
If you have location tracking turned on,...

01:02.798 --> 01:05.478
...Facebook collects an enormous amount of location data...

01:05.561 --> 01:08.760
...about where you're going, where you came from, where you live,...

01:08.867 --> 01:12.795
...where you work, what restaurants and businesses you tend to go to...

01:12.893 --> 01:15.811
...and they use this information to target ads at you.

01:15.899 --> 01:19.471
And location data could reveal other people who live in your house,...

01:19.655 --> 01:21.731
...even if you're not connected to them on Facebook.

01:24.314 --> 01:29.465
Now obviously, Facebook knows what its users buy when they click on ads from Facebook.

01:29.905 --> 01:31.179
But what most people don't realize...

01:31.243 --> 01:34.569
...is that they have ways of tracking your offline purchases as well.

01:35.773 --> 01:38.418
For many years, Facebook has had partnerships with data brokers...

01:38.508 --> 01:40.997
...that collected information about people's purchases.

01:41.213 --> 01:44.166
So, for example, if you buy a burrito with your credit card,...

01:44.445 --> 01:46.339
...Facebook could know about that transaction,...

01:46.530 --> 01:50.133
...match it with a credit card that you've added to Facebook or Facebook Messenger,...

01:50.371 --> 01:53.107
...and start showing you ads for indigestion medicine.

01:57.306 --> 02:00.781
One of the most controversial parts of Facebook data collection...

02:00.864 --> 02:03.321
...is a feature called "People You May Know."

02:03.665 --> 02:06.681
And this is where Facebook uses many different signals...

02:06.992 --> 02:10.542
...of what it knows about you to determine who else you might be connected to.

02:10.995 --> 02:13.431
And this is not always things that you share with Facebook.

02:13.527 --> 02:15.345
It might be contacts in your phone.

02:15.634 --> 02:18.773
It might be people who have been in the same room as you.

02:19.167 --> 02:21.911
Facebook was using location data to recommend friends.

02:22.031 --> 02:25.336
So, it might have been recommending people who share a doctor with you...

02:25.417 --> 02:26.901
...or work in the same building.
