ï»¿In the next few months, she began to be promoted.

00:09.215 --> 00:10.961
Her career turned.

00:11.983 --> 00:12.687
Why?

00:13.638 --> 00:15.397
This was a dating breakup.

00:16.418 --> 00:18.227
Why is her career taking off?

00:18.863 --> 00:24.293
Because when you find purpose and meaning in what you're doing,...

00:25.203 --> 00:26.503
...in one area of your life,...

00:28.248 --> 00:32.068
...it grows in every area of your life because you are one person.

00:32.703 --> 00:36.152
That company had a woman coming in with the same dresses on,...

00:36.741 --> 00:40.407
...body looked the same, but it wasn't the same employee.

00:41.379 --> 00:44.952
This was a woman now full of leadership for the first time.

00:46.142 --> 00:52.346
When someone has that meaning and that integrity, things start to change.

00:53.287 --> 00:57.171
The research says when you give up self-interested goals,...

00:57.261 --> 00:58.707
...where most of us are most of the time,...

00:59.455 --> 01:03.337
...and you take on contributive goals, you function differently.

01:03.485 --> 01:04.701
The biology changes.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.253
The thought process changes.

01:06.399 --> 01:07.997
Learning accelerates.

01:08.140 --> 01:09.117
You grow more.

01:09.776 --> 01:11.813
The only thing that I'm left to conclude is,...

01:11.996 --> 01:18.015
...you and I are designed to be purpose-seeking mechanisms.

01:18.329 --> 01:22.535
You've been shaped by life, you've had bad experiences and good experiences,...

01:22.785 --> 01:26.595
...and both the bad experiences and the good experiences are there...

01:26.694 --> 01:28.447
...to teach you something about you.

01:29.313 --> 01:33.891
And if you look very carefully at those, you can determine what your purpose is.

01:34.006 --> 01:37.949
Every person in this room can clarify the purpose of their life,...

01:38.239 --> 01:39.984
...become the key to every door.
