ï»¿The Going Digital Project is an opportunity to achieve some of the social...

00:09.136 --> 00:11.449
...and policy goals we've been pursuing for a long time...

00:11.533 --> 00:12.950
...whether it be in climate change...

00:13.335 --> 00:17.511
...or dealing with aging populations or income inequality.

00:17.691 --> 00:21.472
The speed of what's happening really challenges the existing institutions...

00:21.564 --> 00:23.025
...that we have for policymaking.

00:23.162 --> 00:26.535
It's clear that jobs and skills will be directly affected...

00:26.679 --> 00:29.594
...and it's gonna be sectors that maybe haven't seen automation...

00:29.886 --> 00:30.829
...come to them before,...

00:31.139 --> 00:35.139
...sectors like law, education, finance.

00:35.258 --> 00:39.177
We're  already seeing some great examples across the OECD.

00:39.294 --> 00:42.407
Estonia is beginning to use blockchain already.

00:42.569 --> 00:47.646
We're seeing Mexico beginning to use electronic verification of invoices...

00:48.013 --> 00:50.454
...to make sure tax evasion doesn't occur.

00:50.559 --> 00:54.671
In Paris, people using the technology to whether rent a bike...

00:54.971 --> 01:01.056
...or to get out an electric vehicle for use across the city.

01:01.192 --> 01:02.699
Governments need to do a few things.

01:02.916 --> 01:04.211
They need to be proactive.

01:04.441 --> 01:05.897
They can't be reactive.

01:06.028 --> 01:08.605
They need to be able to begin to look at the transition...

01:08.715 --> 01:11.176
...and begin to do some of that forward planning.

01:11.349 --> 01:14.955
They have to look at the human capital, the people themselves,...

01:15.058 --> 01:18.113
...and that means equipping them with the skills where they can,...

01:18.277 --> 01:20.117
...and these skills will be constantly changing.

01:20.215 --> 01:21.342
We have to get used to that.
