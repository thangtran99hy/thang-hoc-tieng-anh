00:01.737 --> 00:02.769
ï»¿Robert, I've been thinking.

00:02.983 --> 00:05.478
It's great you're helping all these random people and everything.

00:05.561 --> 00:08.005
But that's not gonna fill that hole in your heart.

00:09.451 --> 00:11.542
I am obligated to tell you these things.

00:11.719 --> 00:13.198
I'm the only friend you've got.

00:18.941 --> 00:20.775
Mac, Susan is gone.

00:26.487 --> 00:28.286
Susan worked in a dangerous world.

00:29.695 --> 00:31.427
I looked at the video of all the surveillance.

00:31.722 --> 00:33.445
Something else went on in that room.

00:34.003 --> 00:34.673
Who did this?

00:40.265 --> 00:43.330
Whoever we're looking for are high-level assassins.

00:45.629 --> 00:46.267
They're cleaning up.

00:46.729 --> 00:47.429
Nobody is safe.

00:53.949 --> 00:56.137
You have no idea what you just started.

00:57.348 --> 00:59.165
You shouldn't have gone to war with us, McCall.

01:00.158 --> 01:01.250
You got it backwards.

01:01.739 --> 01:02.770
You're going to war with me.

01:13.648 --> 01:15.955
The mistake they've made was they killed my friend.

01:17.531 --> 01:18.873
There's no coming back from this.

01:26.789 --> 01:28.167
We all gotta pay for our sins.
