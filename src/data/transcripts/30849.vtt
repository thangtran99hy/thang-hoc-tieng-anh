ï»¿We're going to a place where kids can live together on the outside.

00:04.087 --> 00:07.785
The only people who would ever help us are us.

00:13.859 --> 00:15.245
Whatever happens, don't stop!

00:18.607 --> 00:21.923
For their safety and yours, please turn over your children.

00:24.113 --> 00:25.543
I'm smart enough to know you're hiding something.

00:26.825 --> 00:27.927
And you're smart enough to be hiding it.

00:29.403 --> 00:31.108
I just didn't want you to be afraid of me.

00:31.901 --> 00:38.141
The more that I try to control it, the more damage that I do.

00:40.469 --> 00:43.428
I can show you how to use your strengths the way they were meant to be used.

00:47.153 --> 00:48.049
We can fight back.

00:50.991 --> 00:52.693
We don't have to stay in darkness.

00:53.585 --> 00:55.317
We've survived all of this.

01:05.683 --> 01:07.195
I will fight for all of us.
