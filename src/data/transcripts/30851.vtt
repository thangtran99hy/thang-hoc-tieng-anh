ï»¿Before we can understand the circular economy,...

00:04.301 --> 00:06.941
...well, it helps to define the linear economy.

00:07.115 --> 00:10.113
Most organizations today operate in the linear economy...

00:10.249 --> 00:13.097
...which is based on a "take, make and dispose" model.

00:13.223 --> 00:17.823
So, for example, a light bulb company takes resources, like glass or metal,...

00:17.937 --> 00:19.371
...to manufacture its products.

00:19.441 --> 00:23.380
The company makes the bulb and sells it to a customer like me who uses it.

00:23.507 --> 00:26.062
Once the light bulb burns out, I dispose of it.

00:26.377 --> 00:30.151
It's likely neither the company nor I will ever see that light bulb again.

00:31.540 --> 00:34.304
For a light bulb company to make money in the linear economy,...

00:34.419 --> 00:37.111
...it tries to buy materials for the lowest cost possible...

00:37.185 --> 00:39.235
...and to sell as many bulbs as possible.

00:39.445 --> 00:42.889
This model operates as if there are infinite resources,...

00:42.981 --> 00:44.678
...like glass or metal, in the world.

00:44.817 --> 00:47.145
But you and I know that's not the case.

00:47.249 --> 00:50.791
That's why the circular economy treats materials like they're finite.

00:51.174 --> 00:54.673
A company in the circular economy doesn't just recycle products...

00:54.911 --> 00:57.131
...but maintains ownership of them all along.

00:57.297 --> 01:00.741
So the model looks more like this: make, use and return.

01:00.947 --> 01:02.813
Let's go back to the light bulb example.

01:03.145 --> 01:04.533
Instead of buying bulbs,...

01:04.607 --> 01:07.709
...this office in London leases its light from Philips Lighting.

01:08.059 --> 01:11.743
It signed a 15-year lease for the service and pays a fee each quarter.

01:11.991 --> 01:14.273
Philips still owns the actual light bulbs...

01:14.349 --> 01:17.735
...and provides maintenance and replacements when needed, no extra cost.

01:17.933 --> 01:21.857
This model gives Philips the incentive to produce energy-efficient light bulbs...

01:21.980 --> 01:24.747
...and it saves the office money with fixed lighting costs.

01:24.880 --> 01:26.961
It's a radically different business model...

01:27.038 --> 01:31.605
...that makes companies more like service providers than sellers of a physical product.

01:31.813 --> 01:35.292
And it turns out, lots of companies are looking for ways to get involved.
