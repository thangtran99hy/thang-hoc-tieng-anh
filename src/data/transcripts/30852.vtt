The design of this bottle started in Terre Haute, Indiana in 1915.

00:05.513 --> 00:08.867
At the time, Coca-Cola was being sold at soda fountains,...

00:09.234 --> 00:11.725
...or in a glass bottle called a Hutchinson.

00:11.980 --> 00:15.156
But this simple straight-sided bottle was easy to copy...

00:15.242 --> 00:17.421
...and imitations were flooding the market.

00:17.852 --> 00:18.693
The solution:...

00:18.824 --> 00:22.923
...a national contest for a new bottle that would make Coca-Cola stand out,...

00:23.272 --> 00:26.361
...even if the bottle were broken or you touched it in the dark.

00:26.722 --> 00:29.923
The Root Glass Company got to work on their competition entry,...

00:30.188 --> 00:33.041
...looking up the word "coca" in the encyclopedia...

00:33.273 --> 00:36.287
...and coming across an illustration for a cocoa pod.

00:37.845 --> 00:40.255
The curvy, ridged shape appealed to the team...

00:40.382 --> 00:42.688
...who used it as the basis for their winning design.

00:44.317 --> 00:47.073
The first bottles hit the shelves just a year later...

00:47.553 --> 00:50.661
...with the added touch of the glass being colored German green,...

00:50.997 --> 00:56.025
...later changed to Georgia green in honor of the Coca-Cola company's home state.

00:56.529 --> 01:00.728
Sleek and iconic, this is the design that's flaunted its curves...

01:00.819 --> 01:03.803
...to become the trademark of the most popular drink in the world.
