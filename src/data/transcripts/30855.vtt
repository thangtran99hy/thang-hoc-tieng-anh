ï»¿Bus driver, my friend needs to pee.

00:03.522 --> 00:04.567
Don't do it, Pete!

00:05.858 --> 00:07.668
This is what happens when you pee on the bus.

00:09.493 --> 00:11.572
Me and my boyfriend, we're actually going down to LA.

00:11.735 --> 00:12.707
Maybe you should just come with us.

00:13.073 --> 00:14.950
She's five foot four, blonde.

00:15.167 --> 00:15.560
That's her.

00:15.867 --> 00:16.039
Hey!

00:16.475 --> 00:18.489
I know he's the hero of Star Wars.

00:18.597 --> 00:20.515
But who exactly is this Kirk person?

00:20.821 --> 00:21.861
She's out there alone.

00:21.961 --> 00:23.518
She's a very resourceful girl.

00:24.008 --> 00:24.371
Give it to me!

00:24.661 --> 00:25.820
Give me my notebook back!

00:27.686 --> 00:28.299
Where am I?

00:28.397 --> 00:29.869
You're at the hospital, you hit your head.

00:30.061 --> 00:31.222
She jumped out the window!

00:31.457 --> 00:32.893
How did she get away from you people?

00:38.810 --> 00:39.582
What language is that?

00:39.781 --> 00:40.463
It's Klingon.

00:42.958 --> 00:46.719
Your sister is one of the most complex and creative people I know.

00:48.491 --> 00:52.755
People have their own lives and after a while, those lives don't include you.

00:53.069 --> 00:53.642
Captain!

00:53.859 --> 00:56.353
There's only one logical direction in which to go.

00:56.936 --> 00:57.412
Forward.

01:04.143 --> 01:04.616
Light.

01:04.773 --> 01:08.606
It can travel for millions of years before finally reaching its destination.

01:08.687 --> 01:10.303
Do you know how hard it is to write something...

01:10.513 --> 01:12.758
...because the story you wanna tell means so much to you?

01:13.095 --> 01:16.180
It goes lonely and alone, hoping that it will reach someone.

01:16.417 --> 01:17.517
That's amazing!

01:17.735 --> 01:18.823
So, what happens next?

01:19.082 --> 01:21.955
The unknown is there for us to conquer, not to fear.
