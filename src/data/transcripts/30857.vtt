00:01.266 --> 00:05.218
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, more commonly known as ASEAN,...

00:05.333 --> 00:07.775
...marked its 50th anniversary last year.

00:08.035 --> 00:10.703
ASEAN was born out of the superpower rivalry...

00:10.803 --> 00:13.125
...between the U.S. and the then Soviet Union.

00:13.240 --> 00:16.926
It was founded during the height of the Vietnam War by five countries:...

00:17.355 --> 00:21.130
...Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia.

00:21.283 --> 00:23.283
Its purpose was to promote stability...

00:23.348 --> 00:26.620
...and contain the influence of communism during the Cold War.

00:26.796 --> 00:29.648
After the Cold War ended, five other countries,...

00:29.736 --> 00:33.144
...Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar joined,...

00:33.272 --> 00:35.645
...rounding off the 10 members of ASEAN today.

00:35.737 --> 00:40.753
For instance, Indonesia represents nearly 40% of the region's economic output,...

00:40.996 --> 00:44.372
...while the GDP per capita of Singapore, the highest in the 10,...

00:44.441 --> 00:47.985
...is 24 times higher than that of the lowest, Cambodia.

00:48.283 --> 00:50.995
But as a group, ASEAN is a powerhouse,...

00:51.206 --> 00:55.317
...the sixth largest economy in the world, on par with the United Kingdom...

00:55.407 --> 00:57.099
...and ahead of France and India.

00:57.313 --> 00:59.721
It's poised to be the world's growth engine...

00:59.905 --> 01:02.497
...as ASEAN countries like Vietnam and the Philippines...

01:02.621 --> 01:04.242
...boast phenomenal growth rates.

01:04.362 --> 01:06.757
ASEAN has the world's third largest labor force...

01:06.842 --> 01:10.359
...of more than 600 million people, behind China and India,...

01:10.471 --> 01:12.259
...but ahead of the EU and U.S.

01:12.455 --> 01:15.839
More than half of the ASEAN's population is below 30 years old...

01:16.134 --> 01:18.799
...and they love going online with their mobile phones.

01:19.144 --> 01:21.854
Southeast Asians spend more time on the mobile internet...

01:21.957 --> 01:23.509
...than anyone else on the planet.

01:23.695 --> 01:26.673
That's why tech giants like Google, Facebook and Alibaba...

01:26.751 --> 01:29.606
...are scrambling for a share of ASEAN's digital economy...

01:29.793 --> 01:33.514
...forecasted to grow to 200 billion by 2025.
