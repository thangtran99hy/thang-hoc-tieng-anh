00:00.639 --> 00:02.012
For the best part of five years,...

00:02.092 --> 00:04.489
...he's been living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London,...

00:04.631 --> 00:07.135
...confined to a single room but safe in the knowledge...

00:07.205 --> 00:09.011
...he's protected by political asylum.

00:09.525 --> 00:12.799
But could the Wikileaks founder Julian Assange soon be kicked out?

00:14.028 --> 00:17.469
In February, Ecuador's main opposition candidate Guillermo Lasso...

00:17.629 --> 00:20.904
...promised to cordially ask Senor Assange to leave...

00:21.286 --> 00:23.571
...within 30 days of assuming a mandate.

00:23.883 --> 00:26.184
Now he argued of Assange's presence here at the embassy...

00:26.254 --> 00:28.733
...was a burden on Ecuadorian taxpayers,...

00:29.015 --> 00:32.801
...and although he later simply said the situation would be reviewed,...

00:33.044 --> 00:36.763
...the threat is being taken seriously by Assange's legal team.

00:37.368 --> 00:40.469
In 2012, Ecuador announced it was granting Assange asylum,...

00:40.595 --> 00:43.806
...citing the threat represented by the secret US investigation...

00:43.887 --> 00:48.059
...into Wikileaks publishing activities and caused by American politicians...

00:48.143 --> 00:49.604
...for Assange to be assassinated.

00:50.373 --> 00:53.133
But Britain made it clear that if Assange left the building,...

00:53.196 --> 00:55.137
...he'd be arrested and sent to Sweden.

00:55.640 --> 00:58.126
Prosecutors in Stockholm have long sought to extradite him...

00:58.219 --> 01:01.464
...over a sexual assault allegation dating back to 2010,...

01:01.761 --> 01:03.455
...an allegation Assange denies.

01:04.260 --> 01:07.463
Assange, who is now 45, has always said he won't travel to Sweden...

01:07.579 --> 01:09.845
...because he might then be extradited to the U.S.,...

01:10.105 --> 01:12.631
...where, if convicted, he might face the death penalty.

01:13.611 --> 01:16.765
He was finally interviewed by Swedish prosecutors inside the embassy...

01:16.859 --> 01:17.683
...late last year.

01:18.046 --> 01:19.813
Also last year, Assange's supporters...

01:19.915 --> 01:22.877
...welcomed a finding by a working group of the United Nations...

01:23.161 --> 01:26.258
...that his time in the embassy amounted to arbitrary detention.

01:27.140 --> 01:27.530
UK lost.

01:28.509 --> 01:29.586
Sweden lost.

01:30.979 --> 01:32.542
It lost at the highest level.

01:33.424 --> 01:35.963
That's been ridiculed by both the UK and Sweden.

01:36.517 --> 01:39.481
But in March, reports emerged that US federal prosecutors...

01:39.549 --> 01:42.762
...has expanded the grand jury investigation into Wikileaks...

01:43.062 --> 01:45.039
...to include recent leaks of files...

01:45.149 --> 01:48.356
...outlining Central Intelligence Agency hacking techniques.

01:48.729 --> 01:55.461
This is a historic act of devastating incompetence.

01:55.737 --> 01:58.121
That might strengthen Assange's case for asylum...

01:58.257 --> 02:00.913
...but that protection was granted by a presidential decree...

02:00.976 --> 02:04.663
...and it could, in theory, be removed by whoever's in power in Ecuador.

02:04.997 --> 02:06.857
