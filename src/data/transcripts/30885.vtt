And it doesn't matter where my table's positioned in a restaurant,...

00:05.663 --> 00:08.015
...I can never find the waiter when I want that check.

00:08.361 --> 00:11.298
Good news though, more places are letting you pay when you're ready.

00:11.595 --> 00:14.595
Ariel Wesler says tablets at the table on What's Trending.

00:17.379 --> 00:21.191
Tablets are taking over tabletops at restaurants across the country.

00:21.620 --> 00:24.859
We just have been here recently and so we were like, "That's new!"

00:25.079 --> 00:27.052
No more waiting for the check to arrive.

00:27.279 --> 00:29.839
A guest can pay and get their slip and be on their way.

00:30.012 --> 00:32.492
I like the fact that you could split the tab...

00:32.564 --> 00:35.461
...and then you pick your own tip amount for each person.

00:35.549 --> 00:38.109
You can also order appetizers, drinks, desserts...

00:38.239 --> 00:40.263
...and even play games for a small fee.

00:40.604 --> 00:43.119
Have our attention spans really gotten that short?

00:43.418 --> 00:45.668
It's something different than having a wife and husband...

00:45.742 --> 00:47.416
...both on their phone across from each other.

00:47.634 --> 00:50.351
Renee Flores is the assistant manager at Abuelo's.

00:50.464 --> 00:53.759
If you are ever going out and you just forgot to ask your server for one thing...

00:53.837 --> 00:55.438
...and then you're kind of looking around,...

00:55.851 --> 00:58.511
...you can enjoy your meal and there's a button to call the server.

00:58.624 --> 01:01.722
The Mexican restaurant began using the tablets a few weeks ago...

01:01.839 --> 01:05.183
...and joins a long line of casual restaurants embracing the trend.

01:05.355 --> 01:09.537
Large chains like Chili's, Applebee's and Red Robin all use the devices.

01:09.841 --> 01:11.562
Stacked, based in California,..

01:11.635 --> 01:13.783
...even lets you build your own burger on a tablet,...

01:14.047 --> 01:16.547
...a concept McDonald's is testing out as well.

01:16.694 --> 01:19.051
Here at Abuelo's, about 60% of the customers...

01:19.117 --> 01:22.293
...choose to use this Ziosk tablets to order food and to pay.

01:22.569 --> 01:24.605
But if you don't want to, you don't have to.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.087
I like the person coming to the table and taking care of you.

01:27.705 --> 01:27.945
Why?

01:28.658 --> 01:29.605
Oh, because I'm old.

01:30.975 --> 01:33.305
It's not meant to replace the server...

01:33.453 --> 01:36.347
...just to give more convenience to the guest.

01:36.645 --> 01:39.185
Although servers like Conley says he doesn't worry about...

01:39.271 --> 01:42.107
...whether his job will eventually be replaced by a machine.

01:42.387 --> 01:42.711
Never.

01:42.869 --> 01:44.350
There's no personality to it.

01:44.503 --> 01:46.793
You get a lot of people who are regulars so they want to come back,...

01:46.938 --> 01:49.042
...see the same people because of how they treat them.

01:49.409 --> 01:52.885
For many, those added personal touches are well worth the wait.

01:53.228 --> 01:54.179
People are cuter.

01:54.689 --> 01:56.067
Yeah, people are cuter than Ziosk.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.617
It doesn't really talk back to you.
