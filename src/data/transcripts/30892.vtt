ï»¿Let's say I'm the average busy person in the States...

00:02.716 --> 00:06.104
...who would like to be healthy but doesn't have time to cook at home.

00:06.679 --> 00:07.651
What's for breakfast?

00:08.075 --> 00:09.759
Most people's options are limited to things...

00:09.832 --> 00:11.899
...like a McGriddle with hash browns and coffee,...

00:12.286 --> 00:14.204
...or maybe an egg and processed cheese sandwich...

00:14.317 --> 00:15.959
...with Tater tots at Dunkin' Donuts,...

00:16.375 --> 00:19.004
...or some pancakes at Denny's, if you have more time.

00:19.743 --> 00:22.222
Surely, some people will have healthier options than that...

00:22.583 --> 00:25.645
...but I'm trying to think of what most people are going to have access to.

00:26.361 --> 00:28.153
So, what's a quick breakfast in Japan?

00:28.917 --> 00:32.189
While there's more than 6,000 fast food establishments in Japan,...

00:32.579 --> 00:35.312
...there's also 5,000 rice bowl establishments.

00:35.785 --> 00:38.693
The big ones are Yoshinoya, Sukiya and Matsuya.

00:39.234 --> 00:41.391
And for four dollars at Sukiya, for breakfast,...

00:41.475 --> 00:46.001
...you can get plain rice, miso soup with seaweed, an egg, baked fish,...

00:46.410 --> 00:48.253
...and a small potato salad comes with it.

00:48.877 --> 00:52.043
If I'm extra hungry, maybe I'll add some kimchi, fermented soybeans...

00:52.163 --> 00:54.020
... and stewed beef for four dollars.

00:55.051 --> 00:58.832
Or you can put together a reasonably healthy meal from a convenience store.

00:59.425 --> 01:00.847
At a Japanese convenience store,...

01:01.271 --> 01:04.339
...I can get a rice ball, which is just rice, salmon and salt,...

01:04.809 --> 01:08.757
...a small salad, or a package of sushi, or a thing of fish with miso,...

01:09.162 --> 01:10.009
...or some soup.

01:10.689 --> 01:12.927
I was pretty impressed with how little junk is in this.

01:13.109 --> 01:15.943
It's basically just vegetables, pork and fish broth.

01:16.820 --> 01:18.597
And there's a bunch of foods like this.

01:18.792 --> 01:21.126
Here's what I can get for under ten dollars, USD.
