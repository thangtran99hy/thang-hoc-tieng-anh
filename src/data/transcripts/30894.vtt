Taiwan's main city of Taipei was unbelievably beautiful and easy to get around.

00:06.559 --> 00:09.299
You can pick up an EasyCard at any of the Metro stations,...

00:09.418 --> 00:13.052
...and then use it to not only ride the Metro but pick up a YouBike.

00:13.379 --> 00:18.129
Any of these city-owned bicycles strewn literally everywhere throughout Taipei.

00:20.287 --> 00:24.075
This is a really great way to get through the city and see the local temples.

00:24.287 --> 00:27.829
You can even take the bikes downtown and park them at the night park...

00:29.099 --> 00:30.531
...or ride them to the zoo...

00:30.594 --> 00:35.065
...and then take the glass-bottom gondola up to Maokong mountain for a day of teatime.

00:40.955 --> 00:41.851
Why stop there?

00:42.077 --> 00:46.733
Why not go out and get a traditional Taiwanese knife massage and balance your chi...

00:48.559 --> 00:52.039
...or just ride it up to the view of Elephant Mountain.
