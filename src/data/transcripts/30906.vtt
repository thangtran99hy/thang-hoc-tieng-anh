00:00.281 --> 00:02.443
The myriad molars of modern mammals can be traced back to...

00:02.651 --> 00:05.991
...a common form called "tribosphenic,"...

00:06.299 --> 00:08.631
...which first appeared during the dinosaur age.

00:09.095 --> 00:12.797
In the 19th Century, paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope...

00:13.039 --> 00:16.088
...developed the basic model for how this form evolved.

00:16.454 --> 00:19.900
He hypothesized that it started with a cone-like tooth,...

00:20.163 --> 00:23.275
...as we see in many fishes, amphibians, and reptiles.

00:23.615 --> 00:27.596
Small cusps were then added, so the tooth had three in a row,...

00:27.878 --> 00:31.250
...aligned front to back, and connected by crests.

00:31.631 --> 00:36.362
Over time, the cusps were pushed out of line to make triangular crowns,...

00:36.725 --> 00:41.869
...adjacent teeth formed a continuous zigzag of crests for slicing and dicing.

00:42.323 --> 00:45.777
A low shelf then formed at the back of each set of teeth,...

00:46.049 --> 00:48.158
...which became a platform for crushing.

00:48.563 --> 00:51.247
As Cope realized, the tribosphenic molar...

00:51.485 --> 00:53.225
...served as the jumping-off point...

00:53.393 --> 00:56.521
...for the radiation of specialized forms to follow,...

00:56.683 --> 00:58.999
...each shaped by evolutionary needs.

00:59.408 --> 01:01.721
Straighten the crests and remove the shelf,...

01:01.970 --> 01:05.335
...and you've got the conveniently-bladed teeth of cats and dogs.

01:05.900 --> 01:10.823
Remove the front cusp, raise the shelf, and you've got our human molars.

01:11.352 --> 01:14.520
A few additional tweaks get you a horse or cow tooth.

01:15.080 --> 01:18.561
Some details in Cope's intuitive hypothesis proved wrong.

01:18.943 --> 01:20.265
But in the fossil record,...

01:20.476 --> 01:23.821
...there are examples of teeth that look just as he predicted,...

01:24.113 --> 01:27.105
...and we can trace the molars of all living mammals...

01:27.361 --> 01:28.867
...back to that primitive form.
