00:11.367 --> 00:14.515
Solar panels, stretching as far as the eye can see.

00:15.031 --> 00:18.522
China wants to become the world's leading producer of solar energy...

00:18.982 --> 00:21.145
...and is investing massively in solar panels...

00:21.209 --> 00:23.375
...that now covers huge swathes of desert.

00:23.949 --> 00:26.533
The nation is the biggest market for solar energy in the world...

00:26.884 --> 00:29.609
...and home to most of the largest panel manufacturers.

00:30.176 --> 00:35.145
When completed, the Gao Tai solar park will cover 319 square kilometers.

00:35.403 --> 00:40.288
That's three times the size of Paris or 80,000 panels per square kilometer.

00:43.617 --> 00:45.224
This used to be the Gobi Desert.

00:45.496 --> 00:46.439
There was nothing here,...

00:47.454 --> 00:48.587
...just stones and wind.

00:49.483 --> 00:50.671
The earth wasn't arable.

00:50.900 --> 00:51.997
It wasn't profitable,...

00:52.632 --> 00:53.907
...but now it's a treasure.

00:56.112 --> 00:59.006
A nearby coal factory is spewing dark smoke.

00:59.441 --> 01:02.784
China knows its dependency on coal is no longer viable.

01:03.281 --> 01:06.847
Its towns are suffocating; pressure from the public opinion is growing...

01:07.551 --> 01:10.068
...and China has considerable natural assets...

01:10.142 --> 01:12.489
...according to the head of this solar energy plant.

01:17.443 --> 01:18.743
It's not always like this.

01:18.871 --> 01:21.689
We have more than 280 days of sunshine a year.

01:22.166 --> 01:23.359
Winters are very cold,...

01:23.534 --> 01:27.323
...but associated with a clear blue sky, this produces increased efficiency.

01:29.725 --> 01:32.553
Moreover, solar panels require very little maintenance...

01:32.679 --> 01:35.967
...and have a lifetime expectancy of around 25 years.

01:37.023 --> 01:40.645
Problem is that, here in the desert, there is little need for electricity.

01:41.150 --> 01:44.647
It therefore needs to be transported to China's industrial regions.

01:46.567 --> 01:48.274
And that's where the problem lies.

01:48.649 --> 01:51.621
The solar park has grown faster than China's infrastructure.

01:52.101 --> 01:55.277
Today, the plant only runs at half its capacity.
