00:00.146 --> 00:00.590
Here it is,...

00:00.701 --> 00:05.078
...the site of the most highly anticipated wedding in Britain in years:...

00:05.346 --> 00:09.205
...St. George's Chapel, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will tie the knot...

00:09.592 --> 00:11.678
...here on the grounds of Windsor Castle.

00:12.709 --> 00:15.999
With its vaulted ceilings and striking stained glass,...

00:16.186 --> 00:19.340
...it's considered a masterpiece of Gothic architecture.

00:20.553 --> 00:25.223
Plans to build St. George's Chapel got underway in 1475.

00:25.621 --> 00:28.049
It took more than 50 years to complete.

00:28.495 --> 00:32.773
By the time it was done, the man in charge was the infamous King Henry VIII.

00:33.109 --> 00:36.097
Centuries later, his body remains interred here,...

00:36.424 --> 00:39.096
...next to that of his third wife, Jane Seymour.

00:40.146 --> 00:43.321
Here is the famous aisle where Harry and Meghan will walk in...

00:43.383 --> 00:45.621
...and later walk out as newlyweds.

00:45.681 --> 00:49.111
It's not as wide and grandiose as Westminster Abbey,...

00:49.187 --> 00:52.067
...where William married Kate or St. Paul's Cathedral,...

00:52.139 --> 00:56.180
...where Charles married Diana, but many royals have tied the knot right here.

00:56.426 --> 00:58.643
In fact, Harry himself was carried in...

00:58.919 --> 01:01.781
...at just three months old to be baptized right here.
