00:00.018 --> 00:02.109
What we do know is that Queen Elizabeth II...

00:02.207 --> 00:04.146
...is the wealthiest member of the royal family.

00:04.552 --> 00:09.056
Forbes estimates the Queen's personal net worth is around 530 million dollars.

00:09.449 --> 00:11.199
That's a lot, but for context,...

00:11.342 --> 00:13.878
...not enough to put her on the list of the world's richest people.

00:14.255 --> 00:16.099
So where does the Queen's money come from?

00:16.288 --> 00:17.525
It's a little complicated,...

00:17.637 --> 00:20.195
...but it can all be traced back to three main sources:...

00:20.329 --> 00:24.195
...her personal wealth and income, the Sovereign Grant and the Privy Purse.

00:24.656 --> 00:26.673
The Queen's personal investment portfolio...

00:26.772 --> 00:29.031
...includes things like her private jewelry and art.

00:29.451 --> 00:32.407
Then there's her property like the Balmoral Estate in Scotland...

00:32.480 --> 00:34.794
...and the Sandringham Estate in the English Countryside.

00:35.775 --> 00:37.602
The Queen inherited both from her father...

00:37.818 --> 00:42.268
...and their combined value is estimated to be around 175 million dollars.

00:42.742 --> 00:45.442
Okay, now let's look at the second source of the Queen's money:...

00:45.702 --> 00:46.813
...the Sovereign Grant.

00:47.091 --> 00:49.459
This is a lump sum the Queen receives from the government...

00:49.540 --> 00:51.986
...to pay for official duties, things like reception,...

00:52.098 --> 00:54.159
...travel and maintenance of the royal palaces.

00:54.258 --> 00:58.855
The Sovereign Grant for 2017 and 2018 is around 100 million dollars.

00:58.983 --> 01:01.092
The Duke of Edinburgh, Queen Elizabeth's husband,...

01:01.202 --> 01:03.711
...receives an additional annual allowance from Parliament...

01:03.827 --> 01:07.702
...of nearly $500,000 to carry out his public duties.

01:07.915 --> 01:10.585
Okay, let's go back to the Queen's third source of income:...

01:10.714 --> 01:11.852
...the Privy Purse.

01:11.989 --> 01:13.847
This is a fancy way of referring to the money...

01:13.929 --> 01:16.907
...generated by a very large plot of land, property and assets...

01:17.029 --> 01:18.544
...called the Duchy of Lancaster.

01:19.049 --> 01:22.788
The Duchy's main purpose is to provide income for the Duke of Lancaster.

01:23.080 --> 01:27.851
It's estimated the value of the Duchy of Lancaster is around 700 million dollars.

01:27.965 --> 01:32.407
The Queen receives an annual income of around 25 million dollars from that.

01:32.706 --> 01:36.799
In total, the Queen's immediate family is valued at more than 1 billion dollars.
