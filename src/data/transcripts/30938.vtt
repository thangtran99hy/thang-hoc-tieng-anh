00:00.455 --> 00:02.003
So, you receive your invitation...

00:02.083 --> 00:04.021
...and the first thing you start thinking about is...

00:04.291 --> 00:05.456
..."What am I going to wear?"

00:05.931 --> 00:08.094
There's a dress code for Harry and Meghan's wedding,...

00:08.399 --> 00:10.192
...which is for the ladies to wear hats.

00:10.753 --> 00:13.412
It's absolutely very traditional in a British wedding.

00:14.077 --> 00:17.584
Here in the US, we don't wear hats to weddings,...

00:17.726 --> 00:19.239
...but rather we dress to the nines.

00:19.511 --> 00:22.232
Most weddings are formal attire or black tie.

00:25.508 --> 00:27.977
In the UK, it's traditional for the best man's speech...

00:28.105 --> 00:29.827
...to be a little bit risque.

00:30.215 --> 00:32.411
Sometimes, they bite a bit close to the bone,...

00:32.563 --> 00:34.871
...tells them embarrassing stories about the past.

00:35.498 --> 00:37.974
With speeches like that, we would definitely be surprised...

00:38.105 --> 00:40.793
...because here, it's a toast not a roast.

00:42.986 --> 00:46.245
Meghan has ordered a lemon and elderflower sponge cake...

00:46.327 --> 00:47.868
...from the American baker, Claire Ptak.

00:48.206 --> 00:52.330
In the UK, it's traditional to have a fruitcake with a marzipan icing,...

00:52.593 --> 00:56.290
...which is usually tiered and it's usual to save the top layer...

00:56.527 --> 00:57.707
...for the first child's christening.

00:58.265 --> 01:00.942
In the US, couples get to choose their cake and filling.

01:01.102 --> 01:03.863
Cake tasting is absolutely the best part about wedding planning.

01:03.936 --> 01:07.113
You get to taste your specific cake, tailored to you,...

01:07.373 --> 01:11.371
...design it to your liking and absolutely choose your flavor.

01:14.192 --> 01:17.642
A classic favorite of all American weddings is, of course,...

01:17.757 --> 01:20.158
...bubbly: champagne and sparkling wine.

01:20.256 --> 01:21.196
There's really nothing better.

01:21.452 --> 01:25.981
We understand that Meghan's favorite wine is Tignanello from Italy.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.671
Personally, I prefer champagne.
