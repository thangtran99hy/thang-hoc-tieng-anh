00:01.703 --> 00:04.727
ï»¿We've stopped up here at one of the viewpoints on Mt. Fuji...

00:04.797 --> 00:09.857
...and we get this incredible view of some of the other Japanese mountains.

00:12.139 --> 00:15.647
The peak of Mt. Fuji doesn't seem that high when you're up here at the viewpoint,...

00:15.773 --> 00:19.934
...but it's actually almost 4,000 meters above sea level.

00:22.934 --> 00:24.242
We've made it here to Lake Ashi,...

00:24.327 --> 00:26.560
...we're gonna hop on the boat and sail around.

00:28.560 --> 00:30.093
So we're out here on Lake Ashi...

00:30.165 --> 00:33.976
...and not only is it breathtaking and known for its hot springs,...

00:34.059 --> 00:38.869
...but most importantly, it's known for the incredible views of Mt. Fuji.

00:43.610 --> 00:46.547
Got my ticket, gonna head up the Hakone Ropeway.

00:48.873 --> 00:52.047
So the ropeway has brought us up here to the top of Komagatake...

00:52.260 --> 00:55.097
...and the views are breathtaking.

00:55.182 --> 00:57.933
You have Mt. Fuji, you have Lake Ashi...

00:58.101 --> 01:00.651
...and then in the distance, the Pacific Ocean.

01:01.047 --> 01:01.865
I'm in love.
