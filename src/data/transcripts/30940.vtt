00:00.050 --> 00:02.284
ï»¿Istanbul remains a city of experiences.

00:02.993 --> 00:06.071
One of the most memorable is enjoying a Turkish bath.

00:07.310 --> 00:11.189
Today, baths welcome tourists and give a peek into a rich tradition.

00:12.253 --> 00:15.082
You leave absolutely everything in the changing room.

00:17.127 --> 00:22.124
Slip ungracefully into wooden slippers and shuffle into the steamy caldarium.

00:24.848 --> 00:27.841
Turks brought the steam bath with them from Central Asia,...

00:28.367 --> 00:31.010
...blended it with the Roman bath culture they found here...

00:31.301 --> 00:33.475
...and created the Turkish bath.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.005
First, you relax at the basin,...

00:36.399 --> 00:39.949
...heat up, soften up under a cascade of hot water.

00:40.348 --> 00:41.775
Savor the experience,...

00:41.981 --> 00:45.585
...achieving maximum sweating and relaxation.

00:46.664 --> 00:48.446
Then your attendant works you over,...

00:48.657 --> 00:51.941
...scrubbing vigorously with rough Brillo pad-type mitts,...

00:53.187 --> 00:54.908
...then sudsing and washing.

00:58.535 --> 01:01.410
Refreshed and cleaner than you can remember ever being,...

01:01.622 --> 01:05.566
...you venture back into the city, ready for more history and art.
