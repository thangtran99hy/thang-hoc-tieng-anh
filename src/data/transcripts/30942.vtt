Man's best friend with benefits.

00:04.495 --> 00:06.321
These are Dogs for Diabetics.

00:06.559 --> 00:09.783
They're trained to smell dangerous changes in blood sugar levels...

00:09.891 --> 00:11.051
...then alert their owners.

00:11.168 --> 00:15.382
It cost around $50,000 for the organization to train each dog...

00:15.543 --> 00:18.247
...but for diabetics who qualify, the dogs are free.

00:18.506 --> 00:21.715
Mark Ruefenacht is the founder of Dogs for Diabetics.

00:21.880 --> 00:24.505
He's a diabetic who loves to gather data.

00:24.639 --> 00:28.873
So Ruefenacht demonstrates how his diabetes dogs smell low blood sugar...

00:29.017 --> 00:32.581
...by using jars containing swabs of sweat from a diabetic...

00:32.677 --> 00:34.037
...who did have low blood sugar.

00:34.271 --> 00:38.166
Ruefenacht's sweat jar method for training his diabetes alert dogs...

00:38.377 --> 00:40.077
...has been validated scientifically.

00:40.394 --> 00:44.029
This is how  they let him know that his blood sugar level is dropping...

00:44.377 --> 00:47.345
...but because the monitor shows his blood sugar was normal...

00:47.497 --> 00:48.669
...just a few minutes earlier,...

00:48.927 --> 00:51.595
...Ruefenacht decides the dogs simply want to play.
