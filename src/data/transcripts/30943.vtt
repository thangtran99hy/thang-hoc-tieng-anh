In the early 2000s, Alibaba launched Alipay to facilitate user transactions on Taobao,...

00:06.723 --> 00:08.327
...the Chinese equivalent of eBay.

00:09.222 --> 00:12.951
Around the end of the decade, Taobao introduced its mobile wallet features...

00:13.234 --> 00:15.840
...to let Alipay members transfer money to one another...

00:16.006 --> 00:18.369
...or split bills using QR codes.

00:19.982 --> 00:20.559
Good timing.

00:21.043 --> 00:25.431
That was right when the number of mobile users in China began to skyrocket.

00:25.671 --> 00:29.186
One of the biggest reasons is the fact that smartphones in China are really cheap.

00:29.481 --> 00:33.009
And that's made the smartphone really affordable for the masses.

00:33.269 --> 00:37.326
And many people began finding themselves in China's supercharged economy...

00:37.731 --> 00:39.743
...with more money in their bank accounts...

00:40.130 --> 00:43.357
...and began linking those accounts to Alipay.

00:44.555 --> 00:46.677
Not many Chinese people had credit cards.

00:47.021 --> 00:50.959
One factor, Chinese authorities made it difficult for Visa and Mastercard...

00:51.051 --> 00:52.179
...to get a foothold there.

00:52.931 --> 00:59.499
In 2013, Alipay passed PayPal as the world's largest mobile payment platform.

00:59.669 --> 01:02.212
That same year, Tencent got in on the action,...

01:02.594 --> 01:06.425
...bringing mobile payments to its widely popular WeChat app.

01:07.003 --> 01:07.821
In just three years,...

01:07.937 --> 01:13.180
...the newcomer has grabbed up 40% of China's mobile payment transactions.

01:14.141 --> 01:17.733
This was the year before Apple announced Apple Pay...

01:18.119 --> 01:22.955
...which in terms of users, is now way behind its Chinese rivals.
