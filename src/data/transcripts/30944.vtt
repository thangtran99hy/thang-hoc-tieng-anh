00:00.451 --> 00:04.768
ï»¿The American roach has 154 olfactory receptors for smell,...

00:05.085 --> 00:08.658
...and 544 gustatory receptors for taste,...

00:08.860 --> 00:11.240
...more than any other insect on the planet.

00:11.709 --> 00:15.095
As a result, these cockroaches are not picky eaters.

00:15.393 --> 00:18.687
Sure, they like cheese, meat and sugar like the rest of us,...

00:18.943 --> 00:22.128
...but they'll also go for things like cardboard, book bindings,...

00:22.293 --> 00:28.697
...human toenails, rotting meat, blood, excrement, and even each other.

00:29.561 --> 00:30.561
It sounds gross,...

00:30.661 --> 00:34.575
...but this diverse diet makes it easy to find a meal just about anywhere,...

00:34.877 --> 00:37.180
...even if it's poisonous to most animals.

00:37.732 --> 00:41.831
This roach has a bunch of genes called Cytochrome P450s,...

00:41.947 --> 00:45.303
...which help it withstand poisonous chemicals, like peppermint.

00:45.599 --> 00:50.626
These genes code for detoxification enzymes, which keep the insect safe.

00:51.358 --> 00:54.329
On top of that, this roach has a super-strong immune system...

00:54.437 --> 00:57.607
...that seeks out and kills harmful microbes and fungi,...

00:58.035 --> 01:00.027
...making the most unsanitary environment...

01:00.138 --> 01:03.370
...look like a five-star hotel to the American cockroach.
