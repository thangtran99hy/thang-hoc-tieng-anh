Today, I'm gonna take you on a mythical journey.

00:03.444 --> 00:04.689
We're visiting Troy.

00:13.482 --> 00:14.781
As the legend goes,...

00:14.953 --> 00:19.113
...the ancient city of Troy was besieged for ten years without success.

00:19.319 --> 00:21.157
Finally, the city was captured,...

00:21.278 --> 00:24.263
...thanks to the warriors hidden in a huge wooden horse.

00:33.985 --> 00:35.787
Homer made Troy immortal,...

00:36.073 --> 00:37.765
...and Brad Pitt made it popular.

00:38.062 --> 00:42.006
Can you imagine the thousands of heroes that once fought on this battlefield?

00:44.498 --> 00:46.832
Troy is not just a historical site.

00:47.037 --> 00:48.567
It's a mythical one as well.

00:54.048 --> 00:58.193
While the horse is world-famous, the real deal in Troy is the ruins.

00:58.348 --> 01:03.004
Over the last 5,000 years, the ancient city was destroyed and rebuilt...

01:03.222 --> 01:06.918
...not once, not twice, but nine times.

01:15.155 --> 01:16.921
So, what about the horse in the movie?

01:17.270 --> 01:18.561
Well, that's in Turkey too,...

01:18.791 --> 01:20.539
...a generous gift from Warner Brothers,...

01:20.742 --> 01:23.437
...and you can find it right here in the city center.

01:30.798 --> 01:34.811
Discover all this and more in Turkey, home of Troy.
