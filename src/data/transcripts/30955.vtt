The late Dr. Martin Luther King once said, and I quote...

00:08.579 --> 00:15.239
..."We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love.

00:16.737 --> 00:22.485
And when we do that, we will make of this old world...

00:23.031 --> 00:29.290
...a new world, for love is the only way."

00:31.789 --> 00:32.881
There's power in love.

00:35.313 --> 00:36.483
Don't underestimate it.

00:38.697 --> 00:41.136
Don't even oversentimentalize it.

00:42.692 --> 00:45.873
There's power, power in love.

00:47.895 --> 00:53.271
If you don't believe me, think about a time when you first fell in love.

00:55.236 --> 01:00.266
The whole world seemed to center around you and your beloved.

01:01.736 --> 01:04.934
Oh, there's power, power in love.

01:06.280 --> 01:11.595
Not just in its romantic forms, but any form, any shape of love.

01:12.603 --> 01:18.281
There's a certain sense in which, when you are loved, and you know it,...

01:19.153 --> 01:21.386
...when someone cares for you, and you know it,...

01:22.337 --> 01:27.525
...when you love and you show it, it actually feels right.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.201
There's something right about it.
