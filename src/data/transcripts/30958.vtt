To deal with rainwater and heat,...

00:02.224 --> 00:06.441
...Berlin is being transformed into what's being called a Sponge City.

00:09.263 --> 00:13.135
Carlo Becker is the architect of Berlin's Sponge City strategy,...

00:13.425 --> 00:16.083
...which harnesses rainwater and manages heat.

00:17.038 --> 00:21.460
In a natural ecosystem, rainwater is soaked up by soil and vegetation.

00:23.439 --> 00:28.058
The majority then evaporates and the rest filters deeper into the ground.

00:29.242 --> 00:32.155
The evaporating water then cools the surroundings.

00:33.866 --> 00:35.354
Cities disrupt this system.

00:35.549 --> 00:38.725
Water can't soak through the concrete and is piped away.

00:41.689 --> 00:45.277
The Sponge City strategy aims to keep rainwater where it lands,..

00:45.429 --> 00:47.325
...to imitate the natural water cycle.

00:48.415 --> 00:51.086
Buildings are covered in green roofs and facades.

00:51.567 --> 00:53.833
And down on street-level, urban wetlands...

00:53.911 --> 00:58.143
...and roadside trenches known as Swales filter runoff and hold water,...

00:58.489 --> 01:01.247
...keeping the city cool by imitating nature.
