ï»¿Just tell me you didn't invite your grandmother.

00:03.388 --> 00:04.717
Wicked witch of the west.

00:08.963 --> 00:10.516
Oh my god.

00:12.043 --> 00:15.646
I've decided to commit to being a grandmother.

00:16.083 --> 00:17.891
Grandma, you weren't invited.

00:17.994 --> 00:19.959
That's the best kind of party, little girl.

00:25.155 --> 00:27.499
My soul mate may actually be carbs.

00:28.479 --> 00:29.852
Then mine must be wine.

00:31.603 --> 00:34.286
All three of us are grandfathers, and that's that.

00:37.885 --> 00:39.511
Look what you've done with the place.

00:40.426 --> 00:41.825
She wanted to make her mom proud.

00:42.257 --> 00:43.741
If she hasn't done that all her life.

00:46.585 --> 00:48.842
We can't tell anybody about the baby yet.

00:48.982 --> 00:49.866
I just told Bill.

00:49.954 --> 00:50.887
Yeah, and I told Harry.

00:51.402 --> 00:54.290
I told many, many people.

00:56.643 --> 00:58.890
You are about to become a great grandmother.

00:58.975 --> 01:02.268
Great grandmother, I'm leaving that out of the bio.
