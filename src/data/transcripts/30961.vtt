00:01.144 --> 00:02.253
ï»¿I actually got a job.

00:02.475 --> 00:02.821
Really?

00:02.919 --> 00:03.400
A job?

00:03.589 --> 00:05.917
You will work Monday to Friday 9:00 to 3:00.

00:06.003 --> 00:07.685
You won't regret, for a moment, hiring me.

00:07.892 --> 00:08.739
Excellent.

00:09.186 --> 00:11.129
Ah, the curse of the summer people.

00:11.267 --> 00:13.527
They dangle their money around to make us do whatever they want.

00:13.659 --> 00:14.600
Joanie Williams,...

00:14.830 --> 00:15.925
...can I see you tomorrow?

00:16.153 --> 00:19.128
I wish you lots of luck, Bobby Marks, and I'll be back in a few weeks.

00:26.975 --> 00:27.727
Hey, what are you doing?

00:27.840 --> 00:28.477
I'm up here!

00:30.791 --> 00:32.301
You sure everything's okay with you?

00:32.411 --> 00:33.387
I'm not a kid anymore.

00:33.559 --> 00:34.960
You'll tell me if it wasn't, wouldn't you?

00:35.469 --> 00:36.479
Have you ever been bullied?

00:36.594 --> 00:38.510
Yes, by some of the best.

00:38.884 --> 00:41.520
Seems like all my problems are caused by summer people.

00:42.764 --> 00:43.801
Some of the worst.

00:45.807 --> 00:46.567
You leave me alone.

00:46.670 --> 00:48.479
What's a fat kid like you gonna do?

00:49.923 --> 00:51.271
What's going on with mom and dad?

00:51.485 --> 00:52.224
Something's up.

00:52.440 --> 00:53.076
Don't worry about it.

00:53.285 --> 00:54.341
About time you grew up.

00:54.633 --> 00:55.562
Hey, I'm growing up.

01:03.654 --> 01:07.949
The measure of a man is his ability to navigate to a proper shore...

01:08.151 --> 01:09.765
...during the worst of the storm.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.009
Hey, that's pretty good.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.326
I should write that one down.
