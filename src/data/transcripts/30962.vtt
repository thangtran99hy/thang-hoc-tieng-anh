00:02.607 --> 00:06.273
ï»¿The design of this shoe starts in Oregon in 1981...

00:06.467 --> 00:08.525
...and with a man called Tinker Hatfield.

00:08.905 --> 00:10.497
He was an architect for Nike,...

00:10.573 --> 00:13.991
...hired to draw up offices and showrooms on the company's campus.

00:14.799 --> 00:17.907
Hatfield headed to Paris in search of inspiration.

00:18.417 --> 00:20.967
While he was there, he visited the Pompidou Centre,...

00:21.303 --> 00:24.581
...a radical building famous for its inside-out design,...

00:24.683 --> 00:26.800
...which exposed the building's components...

00:26.894 --> 00:29.971
...like escalators and heating pipes for everyone to see.

00:31.545 --> 00:35.087
Hatfield decided to apply the same principle to his own design,...

00:35.359 --> 00:37.309
...revealing the inner workings of his shoe...

00:37.396 --> 00:40.163
...by making the air cushioning system visible.

00:40.937 --> 00:44.448
The marketing team thought the air bubble would seem like a weakness,...

00:44.595 --> 00:49.407
...but the Nike Air Max 1 was an instant hit when it launched in 1987.

00:50.107 --> 00:55.259
Originally, pairs sold for 75 dollars. Now they go for double that.

00:56.332 --> 01:01.050
Stylish and innovative, this is the design that stayed one step ahead,...

01:01.257 --> 01:03.807
...simply by being turned inside out.
