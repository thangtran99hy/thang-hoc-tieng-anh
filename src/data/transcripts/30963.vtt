The design of this logo began in Seattle in 1971...

00:05.008 --> 00:07.869
...with three university friends who really liked coffee.

00:08.459 --> 00:11.815
They also really liked the Herman Melville novel "Moby Dick",...

00:12.189 --> 00:16.907
...so much so, they decided to name their company after Captain Ahab's ship.

00:17.999 --> 00:23.088
But branding exec Terry Heckler decided Pequod coffee didn't sound quite right,...

00:23.299 --> 00:26.623
...so they went with the name of the first mate: Starbuck.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.528
Heckler then trawled through maritime books...

00:29.621 --> 00:32.977
...and found a 15th century woodcut of a two-tailed siren.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.839
Instead of luring sailors onto the rocks,...

00:36.997 --> 00:40.903
...this mythical mermaid would call people to come and grab a cup of coffee.

00:41.634 --> 00:45.209
Initially her chest was bare, but after some complaints,...

00:45.399 --> 00:49.157
...Heckler redrew the design with long hair that covered her body.

00:49.523 --> 00:54.241
The logo also went from brown to green, a symbol of freshness and growth.

00:54.835 --> 00:59.243
In 2011, the Starbucks siren was redesigned with rounder details.

00:59.449 --> 01:02.743
A longer shadow was also introduced on the right side of her nose,...

01:02.903 --> 01:06.829
...a small element of asymmetry which made her feel more human.

01:07.574 --> 01:10.871
She can be spotted in 76 countries and markets,...

01:11.023 --> 01:16.174
...helping Starbucks to reach a brand value of more than 8.7 billion dollars.

01:17.525 --> 01:18.919
Bold and alluring,...

01:19.200 --> 01:23.515
...this is the design that started with a myth and became a coffee legend.
