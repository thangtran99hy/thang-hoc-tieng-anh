The 9.5-kilometer horseshoe would literally ring the harbor of Swansea.

00:06.967 --> 00:11.058
Once in place, the huge tides on the English coast will be spinning turbines...

00:11.125 --> 00:13.246
...and creating huge amounts of energy.

00:13.617 --> 00:16.689
We open the gates in the tidal lagoon, we let the water through the turbines...

00:16.950 --> 00:18.317
...and we generate electricity.

00:18.658 --> 00:21.801
It's five Olympic swimming pools' worth of electricity every second,...

00:22.508 --> 00:26.469
...and that generates enough electricity for 155,000 homes per year.

00:26.928 --> 00:30.040
The core of the project is this massive generator...

00:30.169 --> 00:33.734
...that is equipped with more than 20, six-meter-high turbines...

00:33.830 --> 00:38.160
...that spin when the tide goes in and the tide goes out, four times a day.

00:39.691 --> 00:43.381
That is energy the designers say residents can count on,...

00:43.758 --> 00:47.003
...unlike wind and solar, which can be weather dependent.

00:47.126 --> 00:49.436
So that's the biggest difference between tidal power...

00:49.828 --> 00:51.159
...and say, wind and solar power,...

00:51.237 --> 00:54.026
...is that the wind is intermittent and you get the sun during the day.

00:54.389 --> 00:57.439
With the tides, you always have certain electricity...

00:57.519 --> 00:58.741
...at certain times of the day...

00:59.078 --> 01:01.551
...and then that's staggered at shifts by 40 minutes every day.

01:01.787 --> 01:06.648
The causeway will be created by slowly building it up with giant sandbags...

01:07.377 --> 01:10.304
...and on top of that, a nine-kilometer causeway...

01:10.396 --> 01:12.097
...for running, biking and sightseeing...

01:12.491 --> 01:15.317
...that proponents say will last hundreds of years.

01:15.824 --> 01:17.356
Once we build the breakwater wall,...

01:17.655 --> 01:19.693
...it's going to be there for the next 120 years.

01:19.794 --> 01:22.261
When we put the turbines in there, they're there for the next 120 years.

01:22.697 --> 01:25.119
So what's quite interesting about this piece of infrastructure...

01:25.187 --> 01:26.324
...is it's intergenerational.

01:26.689 --> 01:28.590
It'll last for the next five generations,...

01:28.699 --> 01:31.197
...producing power throughout its lifetime,...

01:31.481 --> 01:33.080
...working with the rhythm of the tides.

01:34.257 --> 01:38.166
The project will cost an estimated 1.6 billion dollars...

01:38.316 --> 01:39.689
...and take four years to build,...

01:40.161 --> 01:44.468
...but it will go a long way towards replacing aging nuclear plants...

01:44.661 --> 01:48.210
...and help the United Kingdom meet its clean energy goals.
