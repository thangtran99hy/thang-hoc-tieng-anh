ï»¿If we want to divide by zero, we need to find its multiplicative inverse,...

00:05.100 --> 00:07.297
...which should be one over zero.

00:07.929 --> 00:13.341
This would have to be such a number that multiplying it by zero would give one.

00:14.276 --> 00:17.885
But because anything multiplied by zero is still zero,...

00:18.164 --> 00:19.957
...such a number is impossible.

00:20.291 --> 00:23.131
So, zero has no multiplicative inverse.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.531
Couldn't we make up a new rule?

00:26.017 --> 00:30.447
Say, that the symbol infinity means one over zero and see what happens?

00:32.098 --> 00:32.623
Let's try it,...

00:32.955 --> 00:35.997
...imagining we don't know anything about infinity already.

00:36.358 --> 00:38.738
Based on the definition of a multiplicative inverse,....

00:39.080 --> 00:42.285
...zero times infinity must be equals to one.

00:42.658 --> 00:48.270
That means zero times infinity plus zero times infinity should be equal two.

00:49.187 --> 00:50.765
Now, by the distributive property,...

00:51.071 --> 00:53.867
...the left side of the equation can be rearranged...

00:53.975 --> 00:56.615
...to zero plus zero times infinity.

00:57.414 --> 01:00.401
And since zero plus zero is definitely zero,...

01:00.677 --> 01:03.684
...that reduces down to zero times infinity.

01:04.259 --> 01:07.755
Unfortunately, we've already defined this as equal to one,...

01:08.252 --> 01:09.830
...while the other side of the equation...

01:10.072 --> 01:12.309
...is still telling us it's equal to two.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.891
So, one equals two.

01:15.867 --> 01:18.443
Oddly enough, that's not necessarily wrong;...

01:18.765 --> 01:22.063
...it's just not true in our normal world of numbers.

01:22.701 --> 01:25.057
There's still a way it could be mathematically valid,...

01:25.285 --> 01:29.305
...if one, two, and every other number were equal to zero.

01:29.667 --> 01:32.124
But having infinity equal to zero...

01:32.322 --> 01:36.877
...is ultimately not all that useful to mathematicians or anyone else.
