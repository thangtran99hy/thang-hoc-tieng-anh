ï»¿Tell me about the mission.

00:04.079 --> 00:06.093
Did you see anything unusual?

00:08.394 --> 00:10.208
Like an alien, you mean?

00:13.811 --> 00:14.676
He saw something.

00:14.952 --> 00:15.403
Oh yeah.

00:15.511 --> 00:16.087
Yeah.

00:17.843 --> 00:21.405
And your men? Someone or something tore them to pieces.

00:25.887 --> 00:27.768
I think they're attempting hybridization.

00:29.165 --> 00:31.025
They're upgrading on every planet they visit.

00:31.119 --> 00:32.711
We need to know if you pose a threat.

00:32.835 --> 00:36.273
We're assassins. Isn't posing a threat kind of the point?
