ï»¿You need to be brave, really brave.

00:05.087 --> 00:08.691
And I know, when you think of courageous leaders,...

00:08.952 --> 00:13.727
...you think of those folks who stood implacably and fearlessly,...

00:13.913 --> 00:16.423
...anchored in their sense of rightness,...

00:16.577 --> 00:20.018
...willing to pit their ideas against all comers,...

00:20.129 --> 00:23.789
...against the slings and arrows aimed their way.

00:25.029 --> 00:28.973
Well, I don't think that's brave enough.

00:29.875 --> 00:35.305
I don't think that's good enough for what our shared future will ask of you.

00:35.676 --> 00:39.806
I actually don't think it's ever been good enough.

00:40.094 --> 00:45.339
To let yourself be vulnerable to another point of view...

00:45.521 --> 00:49.249
...that's what takes true courage.

00:49.657 --> 00:52.778
To open yourself to another's convictions,...

00:52.929 --> 00:56.935
...and risk being convinced, a little, or a lot,...

00:57.140 --> 00:59.597
...of the validity of their perspective.

01:01.015 --> 01:02.633
Now that's scary:...

01:02.982 --> 01:09.062
...discovering that someone you vehemently disagree with might have a point,...

01:09.290 --> 01:11.531
...might even be right.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.483
But here's the question.

01:14.452 --> 01:19.479
Do you want to win an argument and feel good about how superior you are?

01:19.813 --> 01:25.441
Or do you actually want to change behaviors and beliefs?

01:25.973 --> 01:31.371
Do you want to win an argument or do you want to change the world?
