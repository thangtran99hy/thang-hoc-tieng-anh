00:04.985 --> 00:09.027
A truck driver strike over diesel prices had paralyzed much of Brazil.

00:09.412 --> 00:12.544
Halting food and fuel deliveries as main highways were blocked.

00:13.093 --> 00:16.455
Then on Friday, after hearing the army would be sent in to clear the roads,...

00:16.884 --> 00:19.933
...the main truckers union told drivers to abandon the blockade.

00:20.524 --> 00:23.846
But the crisis may not be over for President's Michel Temer's government.

00:24.197 --> 00:27.811
As the Abcam union is encouraging drivers to continue protesting...

00:27.940 --> 00:29.473
...and not make any deliveries.

00:30.270 --> 00:32.833
Food supplies are low in shops and markets.

00:33.179 --> 00:35.660
Many schools have shut and vital services...

00:35.739 --> 00:38.174
...such as rubbish collection had been badly hit.

00:38.788 --> 00:41.681
Brazilians are frustrated and worried as prices go up...

00:42.115 --> 00:43.503
...and supplies run down.

00:45.498 --> 00:48.483
The produce arrived last week, this week nothing arrived.

00:48.861 --> 00:51.778
Eggs that were 80, today are 120.

00:52.227 --> 00:56.381
Potatoes that were 80 for a bag has gone up to 300 to 400.

00:59.921 --> 01:02.067
And petrol stations still have no fuel.

01:02.210 --> 01:04.813
An economic calamity for a road reliant country...

01:04.915 --> 01:06.879
...that's bigger than the United States.
