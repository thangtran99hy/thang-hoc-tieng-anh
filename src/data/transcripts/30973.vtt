00:00.565 --> 00:05.973
The unstoppable force redefining this landscape, is tonight on a collision course...

00:06.071 --> 00:10.261
...with a geothermal power plant, already destroying a warehouse.

00:11.325 --> 00:16.113
Explosive fissures, shooting fountains of lava and fireballs into the sky...

00:16.390 --> 00:19.795
...are now creeping closer to where toxic gases are stored,...

00:20.055 --> 00:24.175
...workers scrambling to shut down three underground wells.

00:24.433 --> 00:26.287
A lot of people are really freaking out.

00:26.691 --> 00:29.613
After another explosion at Kilauea's crater,...

00:29.898 --> 00:32.247
...ash and volcanic smog are drifting.

00:32.623 --> 00:37.513
Laze, when magma cascades into the water, creates a toxic haze...

00:37.781 --> 00:39.845
...that can drift 15 miles.

00:40.221 --> 00:45.083
Meanwhile, the only man injured by a lava bomb while sitting on his porch,...

00:45.272 --> 00:47.727
...is sharing his story for the first time.

00:47.920 --> 00:49.643
It threw me against the wall.

00:49.772 --> 00:53.827
It was like the worst impact I've ever had in my life.

00:53.940 --> 00:55.689
I mean, there's so much force.

00:56.341 --> 00:59.995
Tonight, Kilauea turning part of this tropical paradise...

01:00.191 --> 01:01.829
...into hell on Earth.
