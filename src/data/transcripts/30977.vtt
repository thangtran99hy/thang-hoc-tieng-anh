00:00.615 --> 00:03.537
ï»¿Don't just accept the status quo.

00:04.890 --> 00:07.639
No big challenge has ever been solved...

00:07.797 --> 00:10.905
...and no lasting improvement has ever been achieved...

00:11.371 --> 00:15.408
...unless people dare to try something different.

00:16.355 --> 00:18.534
Dare to think different.

00:20.178 --> 00:24.772
I was lucky to learn from someone who believed this deeply,...

00:25.441 --> 00:29.552
...someone who knew that changing the world starts with following a vision,..

00:29.663 --> 00:30.728
...not a path.

00:31.781 --> 00:36.499
He was my friend and mentor, Steve Jobs.

00:37.623 --> 00:43.641
It's in those truly trying moments that the fearless inspire us.

00:44.872 --> 00:48.227
Fearless like the students of Parkland, Florida,...

00:48.387 --> 00:51.905
...who refused to be silent about the epidemic of gun violence...

00:51.993 --> 00:54.544
...and have rallied millions to their cause.

01:01.803 --> 01:06.088
Fearless like the women who say #MeToo and #TimesUp,...

01:06.331 --> 01:09.455
Women who cast light into dark places...

01:09.925 --> 01:13.157
...and move us to a more just and equal future.

01:14.771 --> 01:18.342
Fearless like those who fight for the rights of immigrants,...

01:18.489 --> 01:21.535
...who understand that our only hopeful future...

01:21.721 --> 01:25.139
...is one that embraces all who want to contribute.
