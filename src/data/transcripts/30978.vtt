The houses you see around you are all solar houses.

00:03.500 --> 00:04.169
I don't know if you know that.

00:04.539 --> 00:05.491
But did you notice?

00:09.744 --> 00:14.109
The goal is to make, have electric, solar roofs...

00:14.541 --> 00:17.660
...that look better than a normal roof,...

00:18.015 --> 00:21.689
...generate electricity lasts longer, have better insulation,...

00:22.361 --> 00:24.894
...and actually have an installed cost...

00:25.189 --> 00:28.381
...that is less than a normal roof plus the cost of electricity.

00:28.892 --> 00:30.997
So we're gonna show you the system before shot of that house.

00:31.194 --> 00:31.502
Over there.

00:31.890 --> 00:33.997
Now, that's all solar.

00:37.139 --> 00:39.715
If you look carefully, you can see the solar cells.

00:40.005 --> 00:41.557
So that house is also solar...

00:41.751 --> 00:44.136
...and that's a sort of a style of a French slate,...

00:44.317 --> 00:46.284
...which is one of the hardest things to produce.

00:46.504 --> 00:49.107
This is what the French slate hydrographic looks like.

00:50.047 --> 00:50.577
You can see that.

00:51.523 --> 00:53.172
The third house is really transformative.

00:53.303 --> 00:56.442
From the vantage point of this tree, it looks completely opaque,...

00:56.600 --> 01:00.243
...but as the angle changes, it goes from transparent to opaque.

01:00.681 --> 01:01.695
To the sun, it's transparent.

01:02.075 --> 01:05.372
The most surprising one is the Tuscan glass.

01:05.825 --> 01:08.894
All of the dark tiles have solar panels.

01:09.678 --> 01:11.998
From the sun's vantage point, which has to be the high angle,...

01:12.701 --> 01:14.885
...you can see the solar cells,...

01:15.321 --> 01:17.349
...but as you change the angle to a shallow angle,...

01:17.631 --> 01:20.517
...it reverts to a sort of an orangey color.

01:20.787 --> 01:22.326
One of the advantages of glass...

01:22.420 --> 01:24.775
...is that we can actually make it a lot tougher...

01:25.144 --> 01:26.931
...and last a lot longer than a conventional roof.

01:27.120 --> 01:30.582
We want to look better, last longer, provide better insulation...

01:30.937 --> 01:33.747
...and cost less, all things considered, than a conventional roof.

01:34.169 --> 01:36.796
And I think taking this approach, it can be.

01:37.037 --> 01:40.104
That's where we're headed and I hope you agree that's the future we want.
