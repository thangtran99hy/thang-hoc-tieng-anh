00:00.993 --> 00:03.513
An unknown hero leaps into action,...

00:03.789 --> 00:07.369
...scaling a Paris apartment building to save a child...

00:07.686 --> 00:10.547
...dangling from a balcony five stories up,...

00:11.011 --> 00:13.669
...his heroic feat caught on camera.

00:13.850 --> 00:16.900
The secret identity of this amazing Spiderman?

00:17.260 --> 00:22.456
Mamoudou Gassama, 22 years old, an illegal immigrant from Mali.

00:23.710 --> 00:25.355
Illegal no more.

00:25.476 --> 00:29.510
The French President invited Gassama to the Elysee palace this morning...

00:29.912 --> 00:34.536
...to thank him for his bravery  and offer him French citizenship.

00:35.059 --> 00:37.794
Thanks to him, a four-year-old boy is safe.

00:39.011 --> 00:42.715
French authorities say the boy's father had gone off to the grocery store...

00:43.039 --> 00:45.916
...and then got distracted playing Pokemon Go.

00:46.295 --> 00:49.449
He'll now face criminal charges of child neglect.

00:50.051 --> 00:53.332
But Gassama's citizenship isn't the only reward.

00:53.559 --> 00:56.787
He's also been offered a job as a firefighter...

00:57.037 --> 01:03.147
...so he can practice every day the heroism he showed in that daring rescue.

01:03.629 --> 01:05.621
