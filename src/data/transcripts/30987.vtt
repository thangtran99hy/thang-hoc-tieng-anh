00:08.039 --> 00:12.602
For much of the 20th century, we believed and were led to believe that...

00:12.719 --> 00:16.229
...environmental sustainability and economic growth...

00:16.461 --> 00:18.525
...or the environment and the economy were really...

00:18.730 --> 00:20.791
...two forces pulling in opposite directions.

00:21.438 --> 00:25.227
I think the interesting thing that we now face at the beginning of the 21st century,...

00:25.691 --> 00:27.942
...particularly on the back of all the lessons we've learned...

00:28.031 --> 00:31.707
...about climate change is that that really is a false dichotomy.

00:32.310 --> 00:35.093
Economic growth, sustained economic development...

00:35.222 --> 00:39.303
...ultimately will be threatened by environmental destruction,...

00:39.384 --> 00:43.217
...by the risks that an unsustainable use of our natural source base...

00:43.347 --> 00:45.975
...or indeed the impacts of economic development...

00:46.057 --> 00:49.421
...on the atmosphere, on the hydrological cycle we'll have.

00:50.013 --> 00:52.697
So, I think the fascinating point in time that we have reached now...

00:52.774 --> 00:56.623
...is that sustainability becomes, in many ways, a precondition...

00:56.742 --> 00:58.327
...for future economic development.

00:58.884 --> 01:01.899
And that means we need to recalibrate the basic policy...

01:02.469 --> 01:05.533
...economic and investment parameters...

01:05.627 --> 01:08.371
...with which we look at the future economic development path.

01:09.028 --> 01:15.012
Sustainability is now a defining and enabling condition for economic growth.

01:15.567 --> 01:18.939
We haven't reached that point yet but I think that is the discussion...

01:19.022 --> 01:22.861
...that is now happening in our societies, in businesses, in boardrooms.
