00:00.823 --> 00:03.909
From the job hunt, the interview, to the work itself:...

00:04.511 --> 00:07.133
The workplace of today looks dramatically different...

00:07.239 --> 00:08.887
...to that of a few decades ago.

00:09.831 --> 00:12.487
Technological change has played a huge role.

00:12.861 --> 00:15.407
The internet has transformed how people search,...

00:15.689 --> 00:17.591
...network, and apply for jobs.

00:18.128 --> 00:20.589
The online job boards mean recruiters can meet...

00:20.695 --> 00:23.489
...a greater number of job hunters than ever before.

00:23.753 --> 00:27.261
Social media means locating and screening potential hires...

00:27.373 --> 00:29.507
...can be done quickly and effortlessly.

00:29.988 --> 00:33.995
And candidate screening can start from doing preliminary background checks...

00:34.077 --> 00:38.013
...using social media to conducting phone or video interviews.

00:39.018 --> 00:42.301
The interview has also broken down geographical boundaries.

00:42.698 --> 00:44.662
Thanks to technology such as Skype,...

00:44.996 --> 00:48.293
...job seekers can now attend interviews anywhere in the world.

00:49.275 --> 00:51.824
In the office, technology has changed things,...

00:51.939 --> 00:55.015
...from how people communicate to how things are stored.

00:55.313 --> 00:57.347
Emails have replaced typed-up notes...

00:57.681 --> 01:00.988
...and cloud storage solutions have replaced the filing cabinet.

01:01.755 --> 01:04.357
The workplace is no longer a man's world.

01:04.889 --> 01:07.163
Traditional gender roles are breaking down...

01:07.360 --> 01:09.502
...and more women are entering the workplace.

01:10.501 --> 01:12.818
The office environment has also changed.

01:13.188 --> 01:16.189
Employer brand has become an important tool for companies...

01:16.291 --> 01:17.723
...to attract the right talent,...

01:18.005 --> 01:21.595
...with 80% of organizations believing their employer brand...

01:21.736 --> 01:23.661
....is a successful recruitment tool.

01:24.385 --> 01:27.925
Added to that, employers will now hire for cultural fit,...

01:28.063 --> 01:30.939
...with the intention of training for skills later on.

01:32.049 --> 01:35.814
While banking, finance and government jobs remain conservative,...

01:35.923 --> 01:39.851
...in dress and atmosphere, many of those working in technology,...

01:40.157 --> 01:43.555
...creative and design fields enjoy a relaxed uniform...

01:43.677 --> 01:46.478
...with an emphasis on fun and inclusion.

01:47.145 --> 01:51.806
Big organizations such as Apple, BBC and Google have adopted...

01:51.934 --> 01:54.777
...collaborative office designs intended to promote...

01:54.903 --> 01:56.859
...chance interactions between staff.

01:57.383 --> 02:00.882
And in some workplaces, there is such a thing as a free lunch.

02:01.457 --> 02:04.259
Traditional perks may have included a company car...

02:04.543 --> 02:08.096
...but today they can range from gym membership, free meals,...

02:08.377 --> 02:10.257
...gaming areas to nap rooms.

02:10.547 --> 02:14.341
Additional benefits may have included stock options, health insurance,...

02:14.474 --> 02:15.703
..and paid paternal leave.

02:16.257 --> 02:19.313
However today, big tech companies are mixing it up.

02:20.491 --> 02:23.565
Apple and Facebook now offer their employees money...

02:23.685 --> 02:25.626
...towards freezing their eggs or sperm.

02:26.064 --> 02:29.980
And Netflix and Virgin allow their employees unlimited holidays,...

02:30.253 --> 02:32.039
...provided that their work is covered.

02:32.922 --> 02:35.831
And it's not just about what goes on inside the office.

02:36.159 --> 02:38.794
The internet has made flexible working arrangements...

02:38.864 --> 02:40.844
...a viable option for many people,...

02:41.047 --> 02:44.326
...reflected in the increase of more people working from home.

02:45.541 --> 02:48.905
In addition, more people are opting to go freelance...

02:49.285 --> 02:52.246
...and it's expected this trend will continue to rise.

02:52.945 --> 02:58.678
By 2020, it's estimated 50 percent of the US workforce will be freelancing.

02:59.655 --> 03:03.315
Many jobs being filled today didn't exist 20 years ago.

03:03.724 --> 03:06.203
And it's predicted that in 10 years time,...

03:06.490 --> 03:10.061
...60% of jobs will be completely new for their time.

03:10.798 --> 03:13.940
How will your role look to future generations?
