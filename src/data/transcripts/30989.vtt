ï»¿Hello. So, I'm here tonight to talk to you about critical thinking...

00:13.975 --> 00:16.038
...and whether or not it matters.

00:16.755 --> 00:18.738
This talk used to have a different title...

00:19.111 --> 00:21.415
...but my friends convinced me that that was sort of harsh.

00:21.729 --> 00:23.648
And so I needed to develop a new thesis,...

00:23.871 --> 00:26.108
...which was not that people are stupid...

00:26.587 --> 00:29.853
...but rather that people think badly.

00:30.297 --> 00:32.479
But then that left me with a new problem,...

00:32.579 --> 00:35.355
...which was why do people think badly.

00:36.272 --> 00:40.127
Well, my first thought was maybe they don't have a lot of formal education...

00:40.866 --> 00:43.302
...but personal experience has shown me...

00:43.617 --> 00:48.470
...that formal education is no shield against shoddy thinking.

00:50.966 --> 00:54.717
Next, I thought maybe they just don't have good information.

00:55.445 --> 00:59.282
And then my final thought was maybe those people are just gullible.

00:59.978 --> 01:04.007
I was surprised to find out that that's a word that doesn't appear in any dictionary.

01:05.794 --> 01:10.817
Let me talk about some historical examples of bad thinking.

01:11.142 --> 01:12.543
This is Charles Ponzi.

01:12.879 --> 01:14.525
He was a charming Italian immigrant...

01:14.697 --> 01:16.797
...to the United States in the 1920s.

01:17.429 --> 01:21.291
And he had an amazing new investment idea.

01:21.754 --> 01:26.165
Word got around about this idea and investors poured their money in.

01:26.287 --> 01:30.161
What Ponzi would do for you is, if you parked your money with him for 30 days,...

01:30.779 --> 01:35.550
...he would return it with up to a 50% increase, just one month later.

01:36.339 --> 01:38.982
So again, that became a very popular idea.

01:39.633 --> 01:43.809
Well, people at the time didn't realize that Ponzi was the inventor...

01:43.914 --> 01:45.723
...of what's now known as a pyramid scheme,...

01:46.084 --> 01:50.021
...also known as a Ponzi game but until they realized that...

01:50.677 --> 01:55.019
...a lot of people made a lot of money right up until they didn't...

01:55.328 --> 01:56.803
...when the scheme collapsed.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.521
Ponzi went to jail for a brief time...

01:59.586 --> 02:01.968
...and then was deported back to his native country.
