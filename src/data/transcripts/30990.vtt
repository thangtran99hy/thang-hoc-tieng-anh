Mr. Sawyer, is your family enjoying their stay?

00:04.949 --> 00:05.660
Very much so.

00:05.752 --> 00:07.330
They're shocked you gave us the entire floor.

00:07.577 --> 00:09.119
After your security assessment,...

00:09.320 --> 00:10.237
...what do you think of the building?

00:10.451 --> 00:14.019
With all due respect, he is a glorified security guard.

00:14.359 --> 00:14.708
Please.

00:15.125 --> 00:17.953
The Pearl is the tallest, most advanced building in the world.

00:18.202 --> 00:19.436
You've built a vertical city.

00:19.949 --> 00:23.395
But you brought with it every single safety and security challenge...

00:23.476 --> 00:24.273
...that I could think of.

00:24.409 --> 00:25.673
We thought this floor was empty.

00:25.910 --> 00:26.318
So did I.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.875
Not only have you brought them all indoors...

00:29.018 --> 00:32.095
...but you've trapped them 240 floors in the air.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.025
No one really knows what would happen if things go wrong.

00:36.623 --> 00:38.883
But I'm just a glorified security guard, so...

00:39.436 --> 00:40.476
...what the hell do I know anyway?

00:42.381 --> 00:43.060
What's going on?

00:43.179 --> 00:44.654
The 96th floor is on fire.

00:45.834 --> 00:47.725
You're going to be just fine, I promise you that.

00:50.650 --> 00:51.653
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:52.128 --> 00:52.766
Daddy!

00:53.210 --> 00:55.206
Tell me, how much do you love your family?

01:00.579 --> 01:01.508
If we're gonna get out of here,...

01:01.840 --> 01:02.824
...you're gonna have to tell me the truth.

01:05.511 --> 01:08.236
There's a reason why they chose this building.

01:21.481 --> 01:23.748
My family is the only thing that matters to me right now.
