ï»¿Papa, pops, dad.

00:05.367 --> 00:09.961
The men who were protectors, providers, and sometimes, strangers...

00:10.317 --> 00:12.620
...who answered the call to save a country,...

00:12.846 --> 00:15.583
...who left as boys and came home men,...

00:15.733 --> 00:19.583
...fathers that offered their shoulders to ride on and lean on.

00:19.907 --> 00:24.873
They are the men who taught us to throw, to fight, to fly.
