I've read some fantastic books lately.

00:06.355 --> 00:08.297
Here are a few you might want to read this summer.

00:10.253 --> 00:12.733
Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders

00:14.260 --> 00:16.688
Anything about Lincoln is interesting.

00:17.002 --> 00:20.342
I admire him and the tough things he faced,...

00:20.471 --> 00:22.673
...including having his son die being among the worst.

00:22.923 --> 00:27.867
And it is striking this balance between the tragedy of life and the joy of life.

00:28.027 --> 00:33.031
It's about grief and purpose and it's very touching.

00:35.807 --> 00:38.857
Everything Happens for a Reason by Kate Bowler

00:39.442 --> 00:41.855
You've got this one person who's sick...

00:42.148 --> 00:46.618
...and who is trying to figure out how they should deal with their bad news.

00:47.061 --> 00:50.703
You don't want to think of outcomes as just being random,...

00:50.840 --> 00:53.731
...you want to be able to connect them to something you control.

00:53.806 --> 00:56.665
She's not asking you to cry for her.

00:56.785 --> 00:58.954
She's just telling you what happened.

01:01.258 --> 01:03.457
Origin Story by David Christian

01:03.962 --> 01:08.432
The whole theory of Big History is to have a structure...

01:08.644 --> 01:12.277
...that makes it easy to understand and explain things.

01:12.628 --> 01:16.270
I think it helps people to have that understanding...

01:16.697 --> 01:18.613
...that now we have big blocks of knowledge,...

01:18.691 --> 01:21.830
...but the big blocks of knowledge relate to each other in a strong way.

01:22.129 --> 01:25.905
For me, this broad knowledge of how all the pieces fit together,...

01:26.013 --> 01:27.571
...you know, to me, that's interesting.

01:30.175 --> 01:32.365
Factfulness by Hans Rosling

01:32.630 --> 01:33.820
It's pretty fantastic...

01:33.889 --> 01:38.049
...because it really talks through how you should think about the world.

01:38.698 --> 01:40.877
For the first time in this book,...

01:41.196 --> 01:47.617
...he teaches you a categorization of four tiers that is super helpful.

01:48.692 --> 01:51.738
Leonardo da Vinci by Walter Isaacson

01:51.923 --> 01:56.084
What Isaacson does is say what made da Vinci special.

01:56.538 --> 01:58.692
He's most known for his art...

01:58.841 --> 02:06.221
but he thought of himself as a military engineer and a scientist, and an expert on music,...

02:07.186 --> 02:12.523
...and so he really defines the term Renaissance man.
