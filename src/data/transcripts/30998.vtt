ï»¿How real is the chatter about Iraq?

00:03.018 --> 00:03.503
Very.

00:03.719 --> 00:06.045
Are you looking to an Iraqi connection?

00:06.365 --> 00:08.297
No one has actually come out and said anything publicly.

00:08.369 --> 00:09.795
Maybe it's just backroom speculation.

00:09.917 --> 00:11.028
Can we hit it harder than this?

00:11.905 --> 00:15.993
I know that a man named Ahmed Chalabi wants to replace Saddam Hussein,...

00:16.350 --> 00:18.420
...that the Neocons are pushing for the invasion...

00:18.601 --> 00:20.930
...and you are quickly becoming my favorite writer.

00:21.907 --> 00:22.084
Wow!

00:23.777 --> 00:27.384
Proof is coming from every major media outlet in the country except yours.

00:27.482 --> 00:28.589
We're all right, aren't we?

00:28.665 --> 00:30.670
I'm speaking to you because I'm an American citizen...

00:30.747 --> 00:32.521
...and I don't like what these people are doing.

00:32.697 --> 00:33.413
You've got to see this.

00:33.575 --> 00:33.919
What do we do?

00:34.420 --> 00:38.187
When the government says something, you only have one question to ask.

00:39.421 --> 00:40.137
Is it true?

00:41.053 --> 00:43.188
Search is underway to find those responsible.

00:43.864 --> 00:46.803
We write for people whose kids get sent to war.

00:47.516 --> 00:48.661
Our readers need to know.

00:48.730 --> 00:49.942
The President is gonna invade Iraq.

00:51.214 --> 00:53.106
We're gonna run it whether he comments or not.

00:54.203 --> 00:54.998
The President is lying.

00:55.087 --> 00:56.217
He's lying!

00:57.276 --> 00:57.851
It was a setup.

00:59.047 --> 01:00.741
There's always something you don't see coming.

01:03.899 --> 01:04.965
They don't care about the truth.

01:05.592 --> 01:06.448
They want a war.

01:07.462 --> 01:08.359
They're gonna get one.
