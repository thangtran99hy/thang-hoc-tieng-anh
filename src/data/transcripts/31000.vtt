ï»¿Oh, Charlie!

00:08.834 --> 00:11.673
What is it about dogs that brings us so much joy?

00:11.738 --> 00:13.017
Well, hello.

00:13.292 --> 00:16.198
Do you think I'm ridiculous? Throwing a party for my dog?

00:16.480 --> 00:16.817
No!

00:17.003 --> 00:21.476
I went to a doggie wedding last weekend and it was like surprisingly emotional.

00:22.688 --> 00:25.972
Maybe it's because dogs are the most adorable creatures in the planet.

00:26.784 --> 00:30.384
Her little face looks so angry and happy at the same time.

00:33.505 --> 00:36.082
Whatever it is, dogs mean the world to us.

00:36.216 --> 00:37.209
I wanna help you find your dog.

00:37.923 --> 00:38.240
Hop on.

00:38.619 --> 00:39.601
Are you out of your mind?

00:42.050 --> 00:43.648
Gertrude, you look absolutely beautiful today.

00:46.493 --> 00:47.729
This is not our dog.

00:47.819 --> 00:48.687
This is our dog.

00:48.826 --> 00:49.927
This dog has made us family.

00:52.384 --> 00:56.019
Every spot that you've sniffed on this entire walk is the same.

00:56.653 --> 00:58.745
Just pee anywhere!

01:02.635 --> 01:06.249
Dogs open their hearts to us to love and to be loved.

01:06.721 --> 01:07.644
And I find that beautiful.
