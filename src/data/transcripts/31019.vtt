Perpetual motion machines have held a real fascination for inventors...

00:06.665 --> 00:09.905
...for the last several hundred, if not thousand years.

00:10.259 --> 00:17.050
The idea of extracting free energy somehow is a very, very lucrative...

00:17.155 --> 00:18.177
...and seductive one.

00:18.568 --> 00:23.144
Now, to do that, you have to play with the laws of thermodynamics.

00:23.405 --> 00:27.239
Everybody knows the laws of thermodynamics, right?

00:28.041 --> 00:28.991
You can't win.

00:29.353 --> 00:30.327
You can't break even.

00:30.706 --> 00:32.157
You can't get out of the game, right?

00:32.765 --> 00:38.497
So, that said, perpetual motion machines try to defy that...

00:38.659 --> 00:41.721
...through clever systems, using magnets, and waterfalls,...

00:41.837 --> 00:44.257
...and siphons, and gravity, and counterweights.

00:44.693 --> 00:49.433
They purport to extract free energy from the universe somehow.

00:49.859 --> 00:54.278
The patent office of the United States government was so besieged...

00:54.449 --> 00:57.142
...by applications for these things that finally they said,...

00:57.540 --> 01:01.865
..."no more, stop bothering us unless you can bring us a working model...

01:01.969 --> 01:04.093
...that you can park out in our outer office...

01:04.355 --> 01:07.401
...where it will run for one year, with no intervention."

01:07.490 --> 01:10.201
And since then, applications have been way down.
