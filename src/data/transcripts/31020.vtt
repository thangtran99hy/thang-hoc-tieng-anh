Okay, well, so I've shown you that historically people think badly.

00:06.306 --> 00:08.867
Well, why do they think badly is our next question...

00:09.016 --> 00:10.317
...and I have some renditions here.

00:10.400 --> 00:14.108
This is an example of what's known by psychologists as groupthink.

00:14.587 --> 00:18.379
Groupthink means when you're part of a group that wears uniforms,...

00:18.522 --> 00:22.649
...or has a secret password or what psychologists call an in-group,...

00:23.034 --> 00:25.651
...it's really hard literally to step out of line...

00:26.059 --> 00:28.596
...with the decisions of that group.

00:28.717 --> 00:31.796
A member of the national security council of the United States government...

00:32.135 --> 00:37.621
...blamed groupthink for the unanimous decision to go to war against Iraq.

00:39.816 --> 00:41.195
The Asch Experiment.

00:41.526 --> 00:45.652
The Asch experiment basically was again was...

00:45.864 --> 00:48.207
The Asch experiment was put together by a psychologist...

00:48.312 --> 00:48.941
...of that name.

00:49.429 --> 00:54.787
And he discovered that if you have people look at the line...

00:54.887 --> 01:00.809
...on the left and then ask them, "Which of these three lines, A, B or C,...

01:01.172 --> 01:03.308
...is the line on the left most like?"

01:04.135 --> 01:11.491
If nine people say A, the tenth person, not knowing the other nine people...

01:11.711 --> 01:14.968
...are collaborating in advance with the experimenter,...

01:15.299 --> 01:20.907
...that tenth person will almost invariably fall in line and say A as well,...

01:21.061 --> 01:24.136
...showing the power of social uniformity.
