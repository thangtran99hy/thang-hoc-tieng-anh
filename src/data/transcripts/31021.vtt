For those of you joining us now,...

00:32.119 --> 00:33.687
...we have breaking news from the front lines...

00:33.941 --> 00:36.061
...where a few men are stranded between the two armies.

00:36.617 --> 00:38.457
No one knows who they are.

00:40.387 --> 00:42.677
No one knows which side they're on.

00:43.645 --> 00:46.001
And no one wants to get involved.

00:46.097 --> 00:48.985
Sir, neither side will help the men in the trench.

00:49.164 --> 00:51.998
We do not know if they would actually decide to do something.

00:52.306 --> 00:53.451
But what do you expect me to do?

00:53.575 --> 00:55.677
I mean, you can't expect me to risk the lives of our soldiers...

00:55.778 --> 00:57.327
...in order to save theirs, can you?

00:57.423 --> 00:58.015
But Sir?

00:58.155 --> 01:00.853
Tell him it is usual neither side can agree.

01:01.674 --> 01:04.735
Two enemies are becoming the victims...

01:04.914 --> 01:11.211
...in a war between the newsmakers and the peacekeepers.

01:12.437 --> 01:14.447
What started as a minor problem...

01:15.972 --> 01:16.336
Hello.

01:16.792 --> 01:17.248
He needs help.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.965
...is about to become a major incident.

01:20.755 --> 01:21.007
No.

01:21.839 --> 01:24.143
We move him, mine boom.

01:28.477 --> 01:30.359
United Artists proudly presents...

01:30.586 --> 01:33.811
...the highly-acclaimed winner of the Special Jury Prize...

01:33.971 --> 01:36.188
...Cannes Film Festival 2001...

01:36.594 --> 01:37.409
I can do nothing.

01:39.013 --> 01:41.166
Get back into the trench. Pretend to be dizzy.

01:41.358 --> 01:42.541
Okay we go, you...

01:43.189 --> 01:44.407
...don't shoot. Nobody shoots.

01:45.118 --> 01:45.331
Yeah.

01:47.449 --> 01:50.237
"A modern catch-22," exclaims Roger Ebert.

01:50.364 --> 01:52.609
This whole business stinks to high heaven.

01:52.919 --> 01:56.455
"Eloquently simple, virtually unforgettable," raves Newsday.

01:57.361 --> 01:58.061
Did you get it?

01:58.322 --> 01:59.407
No Man's Land
