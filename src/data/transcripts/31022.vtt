00:01.175 --> 00:06.611
The General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR as you've likely heard it called.

00:07.031 --> 00:10.917
It goes into effect on May 25th and it could affect you,...

00:11.713 --> 00:14.349
...no matter where you are or where you live.

00:14.917 --> 00:15.268
How?

00:15.743 --> 00:17.237
Let's answer some questions.

00:18.929 --> 00:21.074
So, what is GDPR?

00:21.539 --> 00:23.775
It tightens Europe's already strict laws...

00:23.856 --> 00:26.387
...about what companies can do with people's data.

00:26.896 --> 00:30.863
It gets you more control over how your data is collected and used,...

00:31.208 --> 00:34.964
...and forces companies to justify everything that they do with it.

00:35.761 --> 00:37.168
How will it affect you?

00:38.059 --> 00:40.939
One way is that you will often have to opt in...

00:41.045 --> 00:43.005
...to letting a company use your data.

00:43.521 --> 00:46.199
This means fewer pre-ticked boxes...

00:46.594 --> 00:50.543
...and firms are compelled to use clear and simple language.

00:52.170 --> 00:56.259
Why is GDPR a concern for non-EU countries?

00:57.905 --> 01:02.488
Because many businesses collect or use EU residence data,...

01:03.161 --> 01:08.367
...they also use companies based in the EU for services and processing data.
