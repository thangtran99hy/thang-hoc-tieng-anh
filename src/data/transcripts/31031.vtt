ï»¿We ask very simple questions:

00:01.580 --> 00:02.737
What makes you happy?

00:03.149 --> 00:03.731
What do you eat?

00:03.941 --> 00:04.993
What do you like to cook?

00:05.476 --> 00:08.568
And everywhere in the world we go and ask these very simple questions,...

00:09.517 --> 00:12.276
...we tend to get some really astonishing answers.

00:15.307 --> 00:16.936
It's hard to imagine he's gone.

00:17.479 --> 00:20.985
Hard to imagine he's not just off on some faraway journey,

00:21.314 --> 00:25.599
Hard  to imagine he'll not soon return with new stories to tell,...

00:25.835 --> 00:27.203
...new foods to share.

00:28.159 --> 00:29.253
Food is the entryway.

00:29.449 --> 00:32.476
I'm a guy who spent 30 years cooking food professionally.

00:32.990 --> 00:34.125
That's where I come from,...

00:34.217 --> 00:35.963
...that's how I'm always gonna look at the world,...

00:37.052 --> 00:38.179
...but food isn't everything.

00:38.707 --> 00:40.898
And something comes up,...

00:40.989 --> 00:44.251
...I'm happy to get up from the meal and wander off elsewhere.

00:44.433 --> 00:49.523
Anthony Bourdain saw the world and experienced life in a way most people never will.

00:50.503 --> 00:54.536
In places near and far, he talked, he tasted,...

00:54.720 --> 00:59.009
...with open mouth and eyes and open heart and mind.

00:59.237 --> 01:02.115
It's impossible from the outside to ever fully know...

01:02.193 --> 01:05.425
...what goes on in someone else's heart or in their head.

01:05.767 --> 01:09.061
It's impossible to fathom how quickly one's life can change.

01:10.103 --> 01:11.291
Anthony once wrote,...

01:11.625 --> 01:15.663
As you move through this life and this world, you change things slightly.

01:15.831 --> 01:18.196
You leave marks behind however small.

01:18.721 --> 01:22.045
And in return, life and travel leaves marks on you.

01:22.695 --> 01:26.485
Most of the time, those marks on your body or your heart are beautiful.

01:26.919 --> 01:28.612
Often, though, they hurt.

01:29.155 --> 01:31.589
Anthony Bourdain was 61 years old.
