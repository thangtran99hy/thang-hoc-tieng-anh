The vision and motivation was relatively simple...

00:06.041 --> 00:07.939
...because our founder Adi Dassler once said...

00:08.057 --> 00:10.646
..."I want to have a major innovation for all...

00:10.770 --> 00:12.731
...and for each and every top sports event."

00:12.916 --> 00:15.454
So, it was definitely a huge motivation to say...

00:15.563 --> 00:16.409
..."Okay, what can we do better?"

00:17.219 --> 00:19.895
We wanted to live up authenticity to progression...

00:20.075 --> 00:21.478
...so, really go back to our roots...

00:21.571 --> 00:24.623
...and spice that up with modern elements.

00:26.109 --> 00:29.493
For 48 years, we had to provide the official match ball for the World Cup...

00:29.599 --> 00:31.613
...and in 1970, we started with the Telstar...

00:31.753 --> 00:33.474
...and this Telstar was absolutely unique...

00:33.550 --> 00:34.871
...in its white and black blocking...

00:34.965 --> 00:38.046
...and that's possibly visible on black and white TV.

00:38.427 --> 00:42.639
So, in the end, it really created an iconic element and an iconic moment.
