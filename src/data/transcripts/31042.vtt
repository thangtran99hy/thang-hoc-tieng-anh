00:02.233 --> 00:05.245
The first proper footballs were made from animal bladders,...

00:05.391 --> 00:07.660
...blown up by mouth and then hand-tied.

00:07.884 --> 00:11.402
These burst easily, prompting the development of more solid leather...

00:11.465 --> 00:16.261
...and cork encased versions in Britain during the 18th and 19th centuries.

00:16.543 --> 00:19.293
In 1872, England's football association...

00:19.471 --> 00:22.224
...set down the first guidelines about ball design,...

00:22.357 --> 00:26.243
...stating that it should be spherical with a circumference of 68 centimeters,...

00:26.638 --> 00:32.486
...cased in leather, weighing between 396 and 453 grams at the start of play.

00:32.940 --> 00:35.868
The weight at kickoff was important as early footballs...

00:35.945 --> 00:38.761
...tended to absorb water, often doubling in weight...

00:38.831 --> 00:40.021
...during the course of the match.

00:40.435 --> 00:44.222
It was common for a player to suffer concussion after heading the ball.

00:45.089 --> 00:48.944
The ball's shape often became distorted towards the end of matches.

00:50.265 --> 00:52.359
During the 1970 tournament,...

00:52.667 --> 00:56.472
...balls were coated with polyurethane to eliminate water absorption...

00:56.778 --> 01:02.245
...but it wasn't until 1986 that the World Cup saw its first fully synthetic football.

01:02.520 --> 01:05.291
The official match ball for the 2018 World Cup...

01:05.561 --> 01:07.967
...is an update of the classic Telstar design...

01:08.254 --> 01:10.138
...used at the 1970 World Cup.

01:10.603 --> 01:12.810
It was the first to be decorated with black panels...

01:12.983 --> 01:15.489
...designed to stand out on black-and-white televisions...

01:15.723 --> 01:17.588
...and change football design forever.
