00:08.084 --> 00:10.859
ï»¿Seven billion people inhabit planet Earth.

00:11.941 --> 00:16.744
Of those alive today, only a small number will leave a lasting impact.

00:17.849 --> 00:21.401
And only the very few will make decisions or take actions...

00:21.937 --> 00:25.754
...that renew their homeland and change the course of history.

00:27.872 --> 00:30.743
History may appear to repeat itself for generations.

00:31.932 --> 00:33.746
Cycles that never seem to end.

00:34.918 --> 00:39.345
There have been times of relative peace and times of great tension.

00:41.336 --> 00:45.379
While this cycle repeats, the light of prosperity and innovation ...

00:45.529 --> 00:47.746
...has burned bright for much of the world.

00:48.613 --> 00:51.427
History is always evolving,...

00:51.657 --> 00:57.126
...and there comes a time when only a few are called upon to make a difference.

00:57.675 --> 01:01.466
But the question is, what difference will the few make?

01:02.115 --> 01:04.892
The past doesn't have to be the future.

01:05.755 --> 01:08.373
Out of the darkness can come the light.

01:08.907 --> 01:11.599
And the light of hope can burn bright.

01:15.934 --> 01:21.877
What if... a people that share a common and rich heritage...

01:22.357 --> 01:24.604
...can find a common future?

01:25.350 --> 01:29.905
Their story is well known but what will be their sequel?

01:34.116 --> 01:37.847
Destiny Pictures presents a story of opportunity.

01:38.369 --> 01:41.030
A new story, a new beginning,...

01:41.572 --> 01:42.326
...one of peace,...

01:42.923 --> 01:47.395
...two men, two leaders, one destiny.

01:49.028 --> 01:51.585
A story about a special moment in time,...

01:52.115 --> 01:56.016
...when a man is presented with one chance that may never be repeated.

01:56.887 --> 01:57.911
What will he choose?

01:58.552 --> 02:00.218
To show vision and leadership?

02:02.379 --> 02:03.256
Or not?

02:08.427 --> 02:10.647
There can only be two results:...

02:12.278 --> 02:13.799
...one of moving back...

02:25.798 --> 02:27.881
...or one of moving forward.

02:37.397 --> 02:39.813
A new world can begin today.

02:42.230 --> 02:45.265
One of friendship, respect, and goodwill.

02:46.239 --> 02:49.873
Be part of that world, where the doors of opportunity...

02:50.007 --> 02:53.656
...are ready to be opened - investment from around the world,...

02:54.009 --> 02:57.738
...where you can have medical breakthroughs, an abundance of resources,...

02:57.915 --> 03:01.127
...innovative technology, and new discoveries.

03:01.671 --> 03:02.406
What if?

03:02.755 --> 03:04.689
Can history be changed?

03:05.100 --> 03:07.233
Will the world embrace this change?

03:07.453 --> 03:10.211
And when could this moment in history begin?

03:10.501 --> 03:12.455
It comes down to a choice.

03:12.779 --> 03:13.647
On this day.

03:14.013 --> 03:15.103
In this time.

03:15.364 --> 03:16.666
At this moment.

03:16.835 --> 03:22.399
The world will be watching, listening, anticipating, hoping.

03:23.459 --> 03:26.377
Will this leader choose to advance his country...

03:26.558 --> 03:28.040
...and be part of a new world?

03:28.543 --> 03:30.368
Be the hero of his people?

03:31.417 --> 03:37.611
Will he shake the hand of peace and enjoy prosperity like he has never seen?

03:37.868 --> 03:41.043
A great life or more isolation?

03:42.256 --> 03:44.348
Which path will be chosen?

03:46.787 --> 03:52.217
Featuring President Donald Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un....

03:53.511 --> 03:56.365
...in a meeting to remake history.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.881
To shine in the sun.

03:59.629 --> 04:03.773
One moment, one choice, what if?

04:06.006 --> 04:08.192
The future remains to be written.
