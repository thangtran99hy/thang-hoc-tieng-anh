ï»¿In 2010, the Miami Heat tried to build a dream team...

00:03.527 --> 00:05.690
...around Lebron James and two other stars.

00:06.229 --> 00:08.886
And Lebron promised that they would win some championships...

00:09.062 --> 00:11.953
...but they struggled to even win close games in the regular season.

00:12.403 --> 00:13.340
So the next year,...

00:13.440 --> 00:16.424
...instead of picking up another star, they added Shane Battier.

00:16.811 --> 00:18.959
And Shane told me people were not impressed.

00:19.329 --> 00:20.859
...and people looked at my limitations...

00:20.937 --> 00:22.475
...and say, "Oh, Battier is not athletic..."

00:22.683 --> 00:23.887
"...and he doesn't run pick-and-roll..."

00:23.964 --> 00:24.983
"...and he can't really dribble."

00:26.101 --> 00:27.164
But here's the weird thing:

00:27.270 --> 00:28.279
When Shane was on the court,...

00:28.455 --> 00:31.453
...every one of his teams were statistically more likely to win.

00:32.082 --> 00:33.637
He ended up becoming a key contributor...

00:33.710 --> 00:35.596
...to the Heat's back-to-back championships.

00:36.107 --> 00:39.295
So, I asked Michael Lewis, the author of "Moneyball" to explain it.

00:39.813 --> 00:43.922
So, he wasn't athletic enough to stop Kobe Bryant,...

00:44.099 --> 00:46.547
...but he was smart enough and kind of canny enough...

00:46.635 --> 00:49.445
...to force Kobe Bryant to places on the floor...

00:49.523 --> 00:51.157
...where he was a less efficient shooter.

00:51.504 --> 00:52.670
So, he was doing all these things...

00:52.748 --> 00:57.111
...that are very valuable that no star would bother to do.

00:57.905 --> 01:00.648
Lots of stars means lots of egos.

01:01.045 --> 01:02.921
And lots of egos means infighting.

01:03.479 --> 01:05.829
In a team, you can actually have too much talent.

01:06.806 --> 01:08.263
Look at the evidence from soccer.

01:08.631 --> 01:10.759
Teams with a mix of stars and role players...

01:10.845 --> 01:14.422
...actually win more games in World Cup qualifying matches.

01:15.304 --> 01:17.947
We see the same pattern in NBA basketball.

01:18.221 --> 01:22.134
You're actually better off with two stars on the court than four.
