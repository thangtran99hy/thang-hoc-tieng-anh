00:02.265 --> 00:05.148
ï»¿I do not think that I should apologize.

00:05.631 --> 00:09.335
Truth is never illustrated through the use of violence.

00:10.033 --> 00:12.001
This is one of the guiding principles...

00:12.150 --> 00:14.805
...that sits at the core of the illuminated thinking...

00:15.073 --> 00:19.365
...created by the man known to the world as Mahatma, the great soul;...

00:19.658 --> 00:21.571
...moral and spiritual teacher,...

00:21.958 --> 00:23.849
...founding father of India.

00:24.219 --> 00:25.419
And even when provoked,...

00:25.540 --> 00:27.649
...he would refuse to denounce his aggressors...

00:27.858 --> 00:28.969
...ever more convinced...

00:29.073 --> 00:32.855
...that nonviolence is the only way to combat violence itself.

00:34.373 --> 00:37.347
On the basis of his traumatic experiences in South Africa,...

00:37.510 --> 00:39.945
...Gandhi developed the concept of Satyagraha,...

00:40.111 --> 00:43.472
...that literally means "adhering unflinchingly to the truth."

00:44.649 --> 00:48.634
As Gandhi saw it, physical force is only used by weak people.

00:49.502 --> 00:54.048
Real strength resides in a person's capacity to express their ideals.

00:56.815 --> 00:59.163
On the 11th of September 1906,...

00:59.327 --> 01:03.067
...Gandhi publicly proclaimed his philosophy for the first time.

01:03.378 --> 01:05.865
Public support was virtually universal.

01:06.945 --> 01:08.856
One must never oppose arrest.

01:09.345 --> 01:11.376
One must never oppose the law.

01:12.037 --> 01:15.051
One must never respond to violence with violence,...

01:15.450 --> 01:19.031
...but one must strive to affirm vigorously the will of the people...

01:19.362 --> 01:21.289
...and uphold religious freedom.
