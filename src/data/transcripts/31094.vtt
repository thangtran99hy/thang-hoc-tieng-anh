00:00.941 --> 00:03.182
ï»¿Modern football is all about the numbers.

00:04.088 --> 00:05.213
We've crunched the data,...

00:05.672 --> 00:09.213
...ranked all of this year's hopefuls, and simulated the competition...

00:09.461 --> 00:12.021
...to see which countries have the potential...

00:12.094 --> 00:14.831
...to lift the World Cup in Russia this summer.

00:17.443 --> 00:20.797
But how do you measure a country's potential for success?

00:21.839 --> 00:26.877
Countries with a large supply of grassroots players tend to produce stronger teams.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.629
Germany has over 16 million players,...

00:31.073 --> 00:33.252
...the most of any country at the World Cup,..

00:33.725 --> 00:35.005
...followed by Brazil.

00:38.303 --> 00:42.495
Iceland is the outlier, with just over 32,000 players,...

00:42.765 --> 00:45.841
...the smallest talent pool of any country in the tournament.

00:47.319 --> 00:49.497
Star players make the difference.

00:50.345 --> 00:54.313
Any team with Lionel Messi stands a chance of victory,...

00:55.418 --> 00:57.007
...but the draw is key.

00:57.917 --> 01:00.585
Even though Portugal have Cristiano Ronaldo...

01:00.806 --> 01:02.573
...and are ranked much higher than Russia,...

01:04.322 --> 01:07.957
...the hosts have a better chance of progressing thanks to an easy group,...

01:08.902 --> 01:11.205
...not forgetting their home advantage.
