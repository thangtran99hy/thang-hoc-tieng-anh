00:00.626 --> 00:03.109
The rescue of the Wild Boar football team...

00:03.391 --> 00:06.177
...has been a herculean international effort.

00:06.721 --> 00:10.177
The team leading the boys out was comprised of 12 divers...

00:10.257 --> 00:12.980
...led by four elite Thai navy seals.

00:13.821 --> 00:16.466
It's thought that divers alongside them were from Britain,...

00:16.785 --> 00:22.458
...the US, Japan and Australia, including the ex-Aussie SAS diving doctor.

00:22.986 --> 00:25.885
Around a hundred divers have been involved in the operation,...

00:26.223 --> 00:29.569
...including volunteers from China, Laos, Myanmar, Denmark...

00:29.639 --> 00:33.705
...and Finland to help lay guide ropes and pre-position supplies...

00:33.800 --> 00:35.545
...and oxygen tanks along the route.

00:36.293 --> 00:39.212
The Wild Boars, who had embarked on an adventure...

00:39.291 --> 00:42.876
...that nearly went so very badly wrong, seem in reasonable shape.

00:43.393 --> 00:45.924
Tonight, their parents are seeing them at the hospital...

00:46.083 --> 00:48.559
...albeit through glass in their isolation unit.
