Do humans ENJOY being free?

00:06.231 --> 00:10.949
Existentialist Jean Paul Sartre claimed that because there is no God,...

00:11.561 --> 00:13.957
...we are CONDEMNED to be free.

00:15.271 --> 00:18.503
In his essay "Existentialism is a Humanism",...

00:18.890 --> 00:23.113
...Sartre famously said that "Existence precedes Essence."

00:23.413 --> 00:26.552
In other words, one first exists,...

00:28.660 --> 00:33.687
...and then one invents one's "self" through the choices he makes.

00:35.526 --> 00:38.325
But such freedom can be quite daunting,...

00:38.437 --> 00:43.154
...and leads to feelings of abandonment, despair and forlornness.

00:43.674 --> 00:46.102
For, not only is there no God to guide us,...

00:46.979 --> 00:48.351
...but our total freedom...

00:48.527 --> 00:52.626
...means each one of us is solely responsible for what he becomes.

00:52.782 --> 00:55.766
Sartre says that to alleviate this burden of choice,...

00:55.955 --> 00:59.656
...we will attempt to deceive ourselves by acting as if we are not free,...

00:59.774 --> 01:03.191
...or what he calls "acting in bad faith."

01:06.904 --> 01:11.900
Consider a situation in which a woman contemplates leaving her husband for her lover.

01:12.671 --> 01:16.733
Is she prepared to face the consequences of such a critical choice;...

01:17.248 --> 01:19.413
...a choice that only SHE can make?

01:19.729 --> 01:23.519
Instead of choosing, she may lure them to a confrontation...

01:25.675 --> 01:29.245
...during which she will idly allow them to fight over her.

01:29.419 --> 01:31.379
The hope is one will prevail.

01:34.105 --> 01:35.971
By relinquishing her choice,...

01:36.208 --> 01:39.813
...she leaves it up to somebody else to define who she is,...

01:39.939 --> 01:42.800
...and thus, she acts in Bad Faith.

01:43.196 --> 01:47.853
In fact, every second of the day we make choices that define us.

01:48.246 --> 01:52.623
The self is constantly changing, always an "open question."
