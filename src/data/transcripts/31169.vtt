Science: perhaps man's greatest tool in understanding how the world works.

00:07.333 --> 00:09.830
But does it lead us to truth?

00:11.067 --> 00:15.475
German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, was an avid science enthusiast.

00:15.923 --> 00:20.455
But, he also recognized that even science has its limitations.

00:20.946 --> 00:24.711
See, science touts the ability to explain the world,...

00:24.919 --> 00:28.243
...when, according to Nietzsche, it can only describe it.

00:30.294 --> 00:34.505
For example, science might attempt to explain why fire burns...

00:34.587 --> 00:38.249
...by saying it's an exothermic combination of a combustible material with oxygen.

00:39.539 --> 00:43.971
That certainly describes how fire burns, but it doesn't quite address why.

00:45.147 --> 00:48.833
As in, "Why does fire exist the way that it does?"

00:50.613 --> 00:54.093
Although science has allowed us to describe the world in greater detail,...

00:54.423 --> 00:57.767
...we're still completely clueless as to the meaning behind it all.

01:00.051 --> 01:03.313
As the philosopher who famously said, "God is dead,"...

01:03.525 --> 01:07.252
...it's obvious that he isn't criticizing science in favor of religion.

01:08.043 --> 01:10.212
But, he recognizes this dilemma.

01:11.201 --> 01:13.688
Religion attempts to answer the question of meaning,...

01:13.783 --> 01:18.187
...but the achievements of science have cast doubt on such beliefs.

01:18.479 --> 01:21.309
Science may try to fill this void of meaning,...

01:22.159 --> 01:25.081
...but it can't, because, as Nietzsche said,...

01:25.365 --> 01:28.969
..."Science has no consideration for ultimate purposes."

01:29.476 --> 01:33.543
Problem for Nietzsche is most people don't recognize this limitation,...

01:33.671 --> 01:37.924
...and instead, worship science as a kind of new religion,...

01:38.744 --> 01:41.511
...an objective value for a godless age.

01:42.299 --> 01:47.698
Just turn on the telly and you'll see how even science can become evangelized.

01:48.189 --> 01:50.306
"And that is a scientific fact."

01:50.523 --> 01:52.213
"Because the Bible says so."

01:52.355 --> 01:54.455
"Proven by real science."

01:54.543 --> 01:56.964
"It is God's will."

01:58.200 --> 02:00.565
Nietzsche dares us to take a step further,...

02:01.001 --> 02:03.250
...to not only think critically of religion,...

02:03.537 --> 02:06.027
...but to think critically of knowledge itself.

02:06.643 --> 02:11.856
For, worshipping knowledge for knowledge's sake can lead to dire consequences.

02:18.572 --> 02:22.237
As he said, "Man shouldn't be the servant of knowledge..."

02:22.799 --> 02:25.411
..."knowledge should be the servant of man."
