00:00.362 --> 00:04.703
In 1998, the French National Team called "Les Bleus" won the World Cup.

00:05.047 --> 00:07.261
A moment that was celebrated throughout the country.

00:08.276 --> 00:11.796
And it seemed to be a breakthrough for French multiculturalism as well,...

00:11.995 --> 00:14.767
...since several players were either immigrants themselves...

00:14.903 --> 00:18.274
...or children of immigrants who came to France in the 20th century.

00:18.677 --> 00:22.112
The team was called the "Black, Blanc, Beur", meaning "Black, White, Arab",...

00:22.314 --> 00:24.827
...a spin on the three colors of the French flag.

00:25.413 --> 00:29.284
Since 2002, the number of Parisian-born players at the World Cup...

00:29.467 --> 00:30.917
...has continued to rise.

00:31.244 --> 00:33.988
Out of all French players at the 2018 World Cup,...

00:34.108 --> 00:37.196
...16 were born or raised in Greater Paris.

00:37.453 --> 00:39.693
And the French national team has eight.

00:41.376 --> 00:45.425
That includes Kylian Mbappe, France's 19-year-old superstar...

00:45.597 --> 00:48.765
...who was born to an Algerian mother and Cameroonian father...

00:48.883 --> 00:50.567
...in the Parisian suburb of Bondy...

00:50.817 --> 00:53.817
...and was trained to the French system Clairefontaine.

00:56.561 --> 00:59.338
But Parisian players don't just play for France.

00:59.655 --> 01:01.591
Over the years, FIFA's eligibility rules have allowed them...

01:01.675 --> 01:05.729
...to play for countries like the Ivory Coast, Morocco, Algeria,...

01:06.093 --> 01:08.180
...Portugal, Cameroon and Togo.

01:08.893 --> 01:11.219
The combination of an established academy system...

01:11.393 --> 01:15.437
...and its unique immigration history is producing incredible talent...

01:15.883 --> 01:18.115
...for France and the rest of the world.
