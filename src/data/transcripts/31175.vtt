00:00.037 --> 00:04.325
France beat Croatia in the final in Moscow by four goals to two,...

00:04.400 --> 00:06.568
...a game laden with historical significance.

00:06.823 --> 00:10.581
These are the scenes on the Champs Elysees in the French capital right now.

00:10.787 --> 00:13.141
It is quite an epic sight,...

00:13.281 --> 00:17.751
...countless French men and women celebrating for as far as the eye can see,...

00:18.174 --> 00:22.715
...a picture very reminiscent of 1998 when Les Bleus won their first world title...

00:22.787 --> 00:26.048
...in a tournament that they were hosting.

00:26.190 --> 00:28.963
And now, 20 years on, they have done it again.

00:29.069 --> 00:31.847
An extraordinary match won by extraordinary players...

00:31.919 --> 00:34.406
...against a very strong side as you can see,...

00:34.689 --> 00:36.712
...the French can't quite believe it.

00:36.787 --> 00:42.773
When they made it past the semifinals on it, it seemed so remarkable already...

00:42.849 --> 00:44.092
...that they should've made it that far.

00:44.175 --> 00:45.589
They knew they had a strong squad,...

00:45.667 --> 00:48.581
...but there were so many other strong sides still in the match.

00:48.710 --> 00:50.071
And now, they've done it,...

00:50.167 --> 00:53.209
...20 years after their 1998 win,...

00:53.353 --> 00:57.335
...and with a team of many youngsters who didn't even remember it...

00:57.415 --> 00:58.773
...or too young to remember it.

00:58.844 --> 01:00.211
Some of them weren't even born.

01:00.470 --> 01:01.825
They've now done it again...

01:01.891 --> 01:05.303
...and that World Cup will be coming back to France.
