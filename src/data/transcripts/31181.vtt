Android phone makers are really bad about keeping your phone up-to-date...

00:04.217 --> 00:06.458
...with the latest version of Android from Google.

00:06.941 --> 00:08.570
There are a lot of reasons for this.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.907
When Google makes a new version of Android,...

00:10.989 --> 00:15.025
...it sends it off to phone makers who modify it for their own devices.

00:15.577 --> 00:17.493
Then that has to go through a bunch of testing...

00:17.559 --> 00:20.948
...before they send it off to carriers for even more testing.

00:21.269 --> 00:23.988
By the time the software update finally hits your phone,...

00:24.155 --> 00:28.471
...months have gone by and Google usually has a new version of Android by then.

00:28.895 --> 00:29.599
The result:...

00:30.116 --> 00:35.538
...94 percent of smartphones out there are running an outdated version of Android.

00:35.914 --> 00:38.527
Android can also be a security nightmare...

00:38.659 --> 00:41.661
...because there are so many different versions of Android out there...

00:42.040 --> 00:46.211
...and phone makers have a hard time getting them updated in a timely manner.

00:46.641 --> 00:48.790
If and when a vulnerability is found,...

00:48.916 --> 00:51.715
...it can take forever for you to get the patch to update it.

00:51.804 --> 00:53.398
The best example is Stagefright,...

00:53.565 --> 00:56.553
...which was a severe vulnerability found a few years ago...

00:56.646 --> 00:59.199
...in practically all Android devices.

00:59.421 --> 01:01.700
Major manufacturers rushed to put out patches...

01:01.788 --> 01:05.918
...to fix the bug but we still don't know if all of them got the patch.
