While most four-year olds are playing with toy motorbikes,...

00:04.455 --> 00:08.305
...incredibly Tima Kuleshov is already riding them.

00:18.759 --> 00:23.085
And his fastest bike can go an impressive 45 miles an hour.

00:29.572 --> 00:32.927
He started riding a bicycle before he was two-years old...

00:33.310 --> 00:35.427
...and soon took part in competitions.

00:37.709 --> 00:40.941
Just a few months later, he began to ride motorbikes.

00:56.209 --> 00:58.140
And by the time he was three and a half,...

00:58.271 --> 01:01.409
...he was taking part in children's competitions in Russia.

01:10.193 --> 01:12.802
His proud parents Alexander and Victoria...

01:13.039 --> 01:16.395
...say that he has no competitors in his native Ukraine.

01:16.925 --> 01:19.599
But despite his success, he doesn't brag.

01:19.971 --> 01:24.194
In fact, he often doesn't even tell people that he rides motorbikes.
