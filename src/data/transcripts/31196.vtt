5G is a software-defined network.

00:03.926 --> 00:06.755
It means that while it won't replace cables entirely,...

00:07.011 --> 00:08.651
...it could replace the need for them...

00:08.812 --> 00:11.296
...by largely operating on the cloud instead.

00:11.385 --> 00:15.143
This means it will have a hundred times better capacity than 4G,...

00:15.241 --> 00:17.923
...which will dramatically improve internet speeds.

00:18.032 --> 00:21.016
For example, to download a two-hour film on 3G...

00:21.206 --> 00:23.136
...would take about 26 hours.

00:23.397 --> 00:25.804
On 4G, you'd be waiting six minutes,...

00:26.103 --> 00:28.540
...and on 5G you'll be ready to watch your film...

00:28.841 --> 00:30.865
...in just over three and a half seconds.

00:31.162 --> 00:33.898
But it's not just internet capacity that will be upgraded.

00:34.049 --> 00:36.436
Response times will also be much faster.

00:36.672 --> 00:41.037
The 4G network responds to our commands in just under 50 milliseconds.

00:41.205 --> 00:44.142
With 5G, it will take around one millisecond,...

00:44.293 --> 00:46.940
...400 times faster than a blink of the eye.

00:47.130 --> 00:50.963
Self-driving cars, for example, require a continuous stream of data.

00:51.201 --> 00:54.367
The quicker that information is delivered to autonomous vehicles,...

00:54.549 --> 00:56.574
...the better and safer they can run.

00:56.655 --> 00:58.700
For many analysts, this is just one example...

00:58.818 --> 01:02.855
...of how 5G could become the connective tissue for the internet of things,...

01:02.982 --> 01:06.380
...an industry that's set to grow threefold by 2025,...

01:06.531 --> 01:10.236
...linking and controlling not just robots, but also medical devices,...

01:10.359 --> 01:13.202
...industrial equipment and agricultural machinery.
