00:00.095 --> 00:02.748
So, when can we start using 5G?

00:02.964 --> 00:07.427
Well not yet, and according to some analysts, not until 2020.

00:07.591 --> 00:11.505
5G was created years ago and has been talked up ever since,...

00:11.671 --> 00:14.327
...yet it's estimated that even by 2025,...

00:14.476 --> 00:17.965
...the network will still lag behind both 4G and 3G...

00:18.059 --> 00:20.135
...in terms of global mobile connections.

00:20.261 --> 00:23.181
Its mainstream existence faces multiple hurdles.

00:23.343 --> 00:26.220
The most significant of these of course is cost.

00:26.311 --> 00:27.605
According to some experts,...

00:27.675 --> 00:31.934
...5G could cause network operators to tear up their current business models...

00:32.121 --> 00:33.949
...for it to make business sense.

00:34.173 --> 00:35.539
In the UK, for example,...

00:35.655 --> 00:39.134
...3G and 4G networks were relatively cheap to set up...

00:39.363 --> 00:42.477
...because they were able to roll out on existing frequencies,...

00:42.641 --> 00:44.387
...on the country's radio spectrum.

00:44.726 --> 00:49.538
For 5G to work properly however, it needs a frequency with much bigger bandwidth,...

00:49.787 --> 00:52.071
...which would require brand new infrastructure.

00:52.316 --> 00:55.469
Some analysts believe that the extensive building and running costs...

00:55.565 --> 00:59.567
...will force operators to share the use and management of the mobile network.

00:59.722 --> 01:02.547
This has been less of an obstacle for countries like China...

01:02.743 --> 01:04.984
...who are taking a more coherent approach.
