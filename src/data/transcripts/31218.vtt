ï»¿Hello, Nashville.

00:05.297 --> 00:07.662
I'm your local weatherman, Carden Corts.

00:07.963 --> 00:12.497
I'm not an actual meteorologist, but I do know my sight words.

00:12.875 --> 00:17.141
Today's weather report is brought to you by the letter C.

00:17.669 --> 00:19.775
And also Pokemon cards!

00:19.975 --> 00:20.575
Pokemon!

00:20.709 --> 00:21.691
Gotta catch 'em all!

00:22.083 --> 00:26.550
Let's take a look at today's weather in Nashville using our new weather simulator.

00:26.808 --> 00:29.145
All I have to do is click this button.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.679
I'm in a hurricane!

00:39.219 --> 00:40.943
So cold.

00:44.998 --> 00:46.445
Is there something behind me?

00:48.198 --> 00:50.001
Ahh, this is more like it.

00:50.815 --> 00:54.060
It's cloudy today in Nashville with a slight chance of rain.

00:54.391 --> 01:00.347
The high today will be 51 degrees with a low of 33 degrees this evening.

01:00.673 --> 01:02.915
But warmer weather is on the way.

01:03.301 --> 01:07.771
Yesterday was the first day of spring and you know what that means...

01:07.953 --> 01:09.885
Spring break!
