ï»¿Hello, welcome to another edition of Corts Reports.

00:06.755 --> 00:09.312
Mother's Day is right around the corner.

00:09.689 --> 00:12.983
It's a great time to tell your mom how much you love her.

00:13.181 --> 00:16.784
You could write her a special card like these.

00:17.441 --> 00:20.671
Thank you mom for making me food so I don't die.

00:23.396 --> 00:25.847
Dear Mom, thank you so much for being my mom.

00:26.310 --> 00:30.625
If I had a different mom, I'd punch her in the face and go find you.

00:30.773 --> 00:34.147
I think that would actually be good for the video.

00:40.825 --> 00:43.509
The best person ever besides dad.

00:43.722 --> 00:44.453
Love you, mom.

00:49.961 --> 00:52.095
Now it's time for Corts on Sports.

00:55.568 --> 01:00.162
The Nashville Predators are in round 2 of the Stanley Cup playoffs.

01:00.448 --> 01:04.945
To get into the playoffs spirit, let's try our new Pekka Rinne goalie simulator.

01:11.301 --> 01:12.668
I'm doing so bad.

01:12.757 --> 01:13.496
I hate that.

01:15.427 --> 01:16.644
That was the worst.

01:17.254 --> 01:21.851
School's almost out so it's time to start planning summer vacations.

01:22.173 --> 01:26.750
Let's use our simulator to visit some awesome vacation spots.

01:28.043 --> 01:29.701
Hey, I'm in New York.

01:30.057 --> 01:32.241
Let's go to a Broadway show.

01:32.945 --> 01:35.450
Or maybe you prefer Hawaii?

01:43.005 --> 01:45.039
Or say you want to go to Texas.

01:47.265 --> 01:49.011
Howdy partner.

01:51.547 --> 01:58.431
Or imagine being magically taken to Delaware.

01:58.815 --> 02:01.026
Hi, I'm in Delaware.

02:02.189 --> 02:04.740
For Corts Reports, I'm Carden Corts.

02:05.235 --> 02:06.796
Happy Mother's Day, Mom.

02:06.931 --> 02:07.773
I love you.
