In 1815, the eruption of Mount Tambora plunged parts of the world into darkness...

00:06.264 --> 00:11.069
...and marked a gloomy period that came to be known as the "Year Without A Summer."

00:11.952 --> 00:13.681
So when Mary and Percy Shelley...

00:13.772 --> 00:16.461
...arrived at the house of Lord Byron on Lake Geneva,...

00:16.955 --> 00:19.265
...their vacation was mostly spent indoors.

00:19.875 --> 00:23.951
For amusement, Byron proposed a challenge to his literary companions:...

00:24.243 --> 00:27.151
...who could write the most chilling ghost story?

00:28.009 --> 00:30.864
This sparked an idea in 18-year-old Mary.

00:31.398 --> 00:35.335
Over the next few months, she would craft the story of Frankenstein.

00:36.311 --> 00:39.655
Popular depictions may evoke a green and groaning figure,...

00:39.975 --> 00:42.121
...but that's not Mary Shelley's monster.

00:42.474 --> 00:47.253
In fact, in the book, Frankenstein refers to the nameless monster's maker,...

00:47.569 --> 00:49.060
...Dr. Victor Frankenstein.

00:49.751 --> 00:53.285
So tense is the struggle between creator and creature...

00:53.557 --> 00:56.517
...that the two have merged in our collective imagination.

00:56.808 --> 00:59.660
Before you read or reread the original text,...

00:59.987 --> 01:03.379
...there are several other things that are helpful to know about Frankenstein...

01:03.675 --> 01:06.484
...and how it came to assume its multiple meanings.

01:06.971 --> 01:11.915
The book traces Dr. Frankenstein's futile quest to impart and sustain life.

01:12.400 --> 01:15.651
He constructs his monster part by part from dead matter...

01:16.071 --> 01:18.335
...and electrifies it into conscious being.

01:18.881 --> 01:20.398
Upon completing the experiment,...

01:20.507 --> 01:23.932
...however, he's horrified at the result and flees.

01:24.348 --> 01:27.661
But time and space aren't enough to banish the abandoned monster,...

01:27.953 --> 01:31.009
...and the plot turns on a chilling chase between the two.
