ï»¿For more than two weeks now, the sun has burned down on Japan...

00:03.191 --> 00:06.322
...from a cloudless sky with barely a waft of wind.

00:08.039 --> 00:12.169
Outside the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, the heat shimmer tells its own story.

00:12.720 --> 00:16.354
Here, the tourists are sweltering in only 37 degrees today.

00:17.390 --> 00:21.029
A little further north, in the city of Kumagaya, it is considerably hotter.

00:21.519 --> 00:24.937
The thermometer here hit 41.1 degrees on Monday,...

00:25.406 --> 00:27.930
...the highest ever recorded anywhere in Japan.

00:28.928 --> 00:32.415
The heat is not just uncomfortable, it is now extremely dangerous.

00:33.150 --> 00:36.877
At Tokyo's Emergency Dispatch Center, the calls are coming thick and fast.

00:38.383 --> 00:40.330
The ambulance crews are struggling to keep up...

00:40.459 --> 00:44.821
...as across Japan, more than 30,000 people have now been hospitalized...

00:44.921 --> 00:46.945
...with heatstroke or heat exhaustion.

00:48.237 --> 00:49.925
The elderly are most at risk.

00:50.184 --> 00:54.725
More than half of the deaths reported so far have been people over 65.

00:56.093 --> 00:59.819
In the ancient capital, Kyoto, the summer festivals are underway.

01:00.287 --> 01:05.036
Here, it has been 38 degrees or more for a solid week, another record.

01:06.365 --> 01:09.649
All of this is being caused by a huge high pressure dome...

01:09.893 --> 01:12.257
...that is sitting over the top of Japan and Korea.

01:13.201 --> 01:15.906
For the last two weeks, it has refused to budge.

01:16.481 --> 01:19.527
The bad news: it could be here for another two.
