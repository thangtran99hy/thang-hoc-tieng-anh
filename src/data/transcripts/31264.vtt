I smelled smoke so we looked out the window and we saw flames coming out of the house.

00:03.853 --> 00:09.562
A couple of brave young boys saved the day for a family trapped in their burning home.

00:09.725 --> 00:11.733
I'm Mara Montalbano for News Views.

00:11.823 --> 00:14.223
And when a neighboring home went up in flames,...

00:14.301 --> 00:19.886
...two kids jumped into action to save some children who are even younger than they are.

00:20.044 --> 00:23.025
I'm just thinking, stay calm, keep your mind straight,...

00:23.577 --> 00:25.057
...stay focused on what you're doing.

00:25.167 --> 00:27.841
Pretty clear thinking for an 11-year-old.

00:28.021 --> 00:33.905
Now, Jeremiah Grimes and his friend ten-year-old Isaiah Francis are being hailed as heroes...

00:34.019 --> 00:39.195
...for running into a burning home and rescuing eight-month-old and one-year-old babies.

00:39.306 --> 00:42.289
When I went inside, all you could see was pitch black smoke everywhere...

00:42.379 --> 00:45.033
...and there's flames and I couldn't see that good.

00:45.173 --> 00:45.916
It's really hot.

00:46.794 --> 00:48.421
It felt like 150 degrees in there.

00:48.545 --> 00:52.117
I found my way outside and I took the two kids to my house.

00:52.224 --> 00:54.315
Firefighters arrived and took it from there,...

00:54.389 --> 00:57.281
...saving two more children and the children's father.

00:57.499 --> 01:00.820
They were all taken to the hospital and are expected to survive.

01:00.984 --> 01:04.649
But as for the quick-thinking kids, they say they're glad they could help.

01:04.917 --> 01:05.720
I'm happy.

01:05.869 --> 01:09.038
As long as everyone's okay, I'm happy.
