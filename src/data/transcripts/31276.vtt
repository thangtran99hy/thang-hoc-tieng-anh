00:01.729 --> 00:07.190
It's official: Apple has become the first 1-trillion-dollar publicly-listed US company.

00:07.470 --> 00:10.309
Started in Steve Jobs' garage in 1976,...

00:10.487 --> 00:13.244
...Apple evolved from selling Mac personal computers...

00:13.411 --> 00:15.652
...to launching the iPhone in 2007...

00:15.869 --> 00:18.482
...and becoming an architect of the mobile revolution.

00:18.748 --> 00:21.253
Along the way, it developed a cult-like following.

00:21.499 --> 00:26.837
Its stock has surged more than 50,000 percent since its 1980 initial public offering.

00:27.091 --> 00:29.022
Now, Apple's stock market value...

00:29.191 --> 00:33.971
...is greater than those of Exxon Mobil, Procter & Gamble and AT&T combined.

00:34.353 --> 00:36.755
The iPhone maker has also pushed its revenue...

00:37.002 --> 00:40.489
...beyond the economic outputs of Portugal, New Zealand, and other countries.

00:40.698 --> 00:43.868
But global demand for smartphones is losing steam.

00:44.053 --> 00:48.276
Analysts say, Apple could lose its lead to the likes of Alphabet or Amazon...

00:48.582 --> 00:51.875
...if it doesn't find a major new product or service soon.
