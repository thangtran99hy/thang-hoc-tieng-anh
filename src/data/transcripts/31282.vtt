ï»¿I'm Dolores Huerta and I am 87 years old...

00:04.136 --> 00:06.516
...and I have been an activist since I was 25.

00:06.882 --> 00:10.057
That's 62 years and I'm still going strong.

00:15.494 --> 00:18.315
I do believe that the people that are being affected by the issues...

00:18.567 --> 00:19.961
...are the best ones that can solve them.

00:20.081 --> 00:23.954
We started the National Farm Workers Association with Cesar Chavez,...

00:24.083 --> 00:26.706
...which became the United Farm Workers of America.

00:27.151 --> 00:31.927
Knowing that ordinary people have the power to come together...

00:32.254 --> 00:34.502
...to organize and that they can change policies,...

00:34.795 --> 00:38.253
...this is what really engaged me and really changed my life...

00:38.601 --> 00:42.825
...and eventually, I left being a school teacher to become an organizer.

00:43.479 --> 00:46.664
The pivotal moment in my life came when I met this great man...

00:46.735 --> 00:48.164
...named Fred Ross Sr.,...

00:48.703 --> 00:52.345
...and I went to a meeting where he showed us pictures...

00:52.754 --> 00:54.905
...of people who would organize themselves...

00:55.693 --> 01:00.045
...by registering to vote, elected the first Latino to the Los Angeles City Council.

01:00.898 --> 01:03.199
The most effective way to make changes...

01:03.279 --> 01:06.055
...is by organizing, especially at the grassroots level.

01:06.738 --> 01:11.669
I call going door-to-door canvassing organizing 101...

01:12.119 --> 01:14.493
...because this is where you can really engage with a voter...

01:14.837 --> 01:16.093
...and explain the issues to them.

01:17.401 --> 01:20.449
People get confused so they just throw up their hands and they don't vote,...

01:20.875 --> 01:24.359
...but we have to say to people, vote for what you're confident in voting...

01:24.649 --> 01:26.863
...even if you have to leave some of the spaces blank.

01:27.229 --> 01:29.151
The important thing is to get in there and vote.

01:29.714 --> 01:34.759
We're seeing a new dawn of resistance, a new dawn of movements...

01:35.263 --> 01:38.222
...and if we don't act responsibly,...

01:38.759 --> 01:42.527
...if we don't engage then we have only ourselves to blame.
