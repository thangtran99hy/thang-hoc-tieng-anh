00:00.211 --> 00:02.625
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe has often been seen...

00:02.705 --> 00:05.062
...as one of Europe's big cultural heroes,...

00:05.440 --> 00:08.069
...comparable to the likes of Shakespeare, Dante and Homer.

00:08.585 --> 00:12.396
During his life, Goethe's admirers were impressed by his literary works,...

00:12.843 --> 00:14.213
...but more than any of his books...

00:14.503 --> 00:17.241
...would impress people at the time was how he lived his life,...

00:17.415 --> 00:18.796
...the kind of person he was.

00:19.295 --> 00:21.555
We can pick up some vital lessons from him.

00:23.426 --> 00:25.382
Goethe's first proper job after law school...

00:25.773 --> 00:27.729
...was as an assistant at a national tribunal,...

00:28.071 --> 00:30.661
...judging cases between the many minor German states...

00:30.969 --> 00:33.325
...that at that time made up the Holy Roman Empire.

00:33.897 --> 00:35.693
While he was working, Goethe fell in love...

00:35.811 --> 00:37.473
...with a fiancee of one of his colleagues.

00:37.878 --> 00:39.511
He then committed a huge indiscretion...

00:39.890 --> 00:41.640
...and wrote up the love affair as a novel.

00:42.001 --> 00:44.371
He called it, "The Sorrows of Young Werther."

00:44.935 --> 00:48.726
The central character, Werther, is a lightly disguised self-portrait.

00:49.496 --> 00:51.751
The book tells the story of how Werther Goethe...

00:52.017 --> 00:53.855
...falls in love with a young woman, Charlotte.

00:54.197 --> 00:57.152
It's a very detailed description of all the tiny steps one takes...

00:57.463 --> 00:58.808
...on the road to infatuation.

00:59.268 --> 01:02.214
They danced together, at one point their feet accidentally touch...

01:02.287 --> 01:06.103
...under the table; they smile, they write each other flirtatious little notes.

01:06.525 --> 01:10.291
It makes being in love seem like the most romantic experience in life.

01:10.679 --> 01:14.090
Werther asked himself, "What is a life without romantic love?

01:14.377 --> 01:16.715
A magic lantern without a lamp."

01:17.211 --> 01:19.883
This deeply charming novel was a bestseller across Europe...

01:19.993 --> 01:21.335
...for the next 25 years.

01:21.757 --> 01:24.059
Napoleon boasted he'd read it seven times.

01:24.549 --> 01:26.209
The story has a miserable ending.

01:26.707 --> 01:29.651
Charlotte doesn't really love Werther and finally rejects him.

01:30.013 --> 01:31.819
In despair, he kills himself.

01:32.195 --> 01:34.617
The tragic denouement shows Goethe beginning to see...

01:34.707 --> 01:37.181
...the limitations of the romantic view of life.

01:37.591 --> 01:39.478
Romantic love is deeply attractive,...

01:39.913 --> 01:42.071
...but it causes us immense problems too.

01:42.718 --> 01:45.239
The core problem, as Goethe came to see it, is this:...

01:45.703 --> 01:48.203
...romantic love hopes to freeze a beautiful moment.

01:48.513 --> 01:49.944
It's a summer's evening after dinner.

01:50.321 --> 01:52.361
Werther is walking in the woods with his beloved.

01:52.762 --> 01:54.471
He wants it to be always like this,...

01:54.781 --> 01:57.033
...so he feels they should get married, have a house together,...

01:57.359 --> 02:00.913
...have children, though in reality, marriage will be nothing at all...

02:01.012 --> 02:02.313
...like the lovely June night.

02:02.709 --> 02:06.529
There'll be exhaustion, bills to pay, squabbles and a sense of confinement.

02:06.939 --> 02:10.023
By comparison, with the extreme hopes of romanticism,...

02:10.475 --> 02:14.257
...real love, as Goethe came to see, is always necessarily...

02:14.551 --> 02:16.165
...a terrible disappointment.

02:16.879 --> 02:19.380
That's why Goethe gradually moved away from romanticism...

02:19.673 --> 02:22.431
...towards an ideology of love he termed classicism,...

02:22.855 --> 02:24.350
...marked by a degree of pessimism,...

02:24.640 --> 02:27.598
...an acceptance of the troubles that afflict all couples over time...

02:28.008 --> 02:31.537
...and of the need to abandon some of the heady hopes of the early days...

02:31.827 --> 02:34.576
...for the sake of tranquility in administrative competence.

02:35.042 --> 02:37.401
Goethe was a critic of romantic ideology...

02:37.731 --> 02:40.696
...not because he was coldhearted or lacking in imagination...

02:41.060 --> 02:43.889
...but because he so deeply and intimately understood...

02:43.969 --> 02:47.592
...the attractions of romanticism and therefore, it's dangerous.
