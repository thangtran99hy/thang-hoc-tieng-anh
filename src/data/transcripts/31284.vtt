Hey everyone, I'm Mr. Willis and this is your Macro Minute...

00:03.065 --> 00:05.500
...on demand-side versus supply-side economics.

00:06.155 --> 00:09.615
In the aggregate economy, there are demand-side and supply-side economics.

00:10.327 --> 00:13.243
Demand-side economics pertain to the behaviors of all consumers...

00:13.577 --> 00:15.809
...who purchase goods and services in the domestic economy.

00:16.513 --> 00:19.451
This includes consumer spending, investment spending by firms,...

00:19.754 --> 00:22.429
...and spending by government at the local, state, and federal level.

00:23.340 --> 00:25.715
Supply-side economics pertain to the behavior of all firms...

00:25.805 --> 00:28.001
...who produce goods and services in the domestic economy.

00:28.847 --> 00:31.047
When using policy to correct economic conditions,...

00:31.565 --> 00:33.790
...government focuses on demand-side economics...

00:34.120 --> 00:37.181
...by trying to influence aggregate demand and consumer behaviors.

00:37.730 --> 00:40.037
But why? Aren't there policies that government can use...

00:40.113 --> 00:42.501
...to influence aggregate supply and the behavior of firms?

00:43.307 --> 00:45.377
Government can change corporate taxes, subsidies,...

00:45.454 --> 00:48.836
...and regulation laws to try to incentivize changes in output production.

00:49.541 --> 00:52.412
However, no matter how advantageous government makes it...

00:52.539 --> 00:55.814
...for domestic firms to change their behaviors, it can never force firms...

00:55.980 --> 00:58.184
... to produce a greater or lesser amount of real GDP output.

00:58.981 --> 01:01.102
Firms are in control of their own production process...

01:01.348 --> 01:04.091
...and so supply-side policies are unpredictable in the results,...

01:04.525 --> 01:06.831
...making them poor tools to fix the aggregate economy.

01:07.729 --> 01:10.223
Demand-side policies, however, are much more predictable.

01:10.758 --> 01:12.374
When government alters its expenditures,...

01:12.704 --> 01:14.594
...it has an instant effect on aggregate demand...

01:15.053 --> 01:16.843
...because government is acting as a consumer...

01:17.104 --> 01:18.588
...to change their consumption patterns.

01:19.273 --> 01:20.831
When government alters tax policy,...

01:21.072 --> 01:22.851
...it changes consumer disposable income,...

01:23.531 --> 01:25.538
...which will have an instant effect on aggregate demand.

01:26.085 --> 01:28.144
For example, if I give you 100 dollars,...

01:28.627 --> 01:30.780
...it's a pretty safe bet you're gonna spend at least a portion of it.

01:31.132 --> 01:33.709
If I take 100 dollars away from you, you're not gonna buy...

01:33.801 --> 01:35.089
...as many things as you used to.

01:35.464 --> 01:36.786
No money, no spending.

01:37.290 --> 01:38.425
"Help me, I'm poor."

01:39.151 --> 01:42.514
As a result, the government will use policies that affect aggregate demand...

01:42.701 --> 01:44.707
...when its goal is to return the aggregate economy...

01:44.886 --> 01:46.056
...to long-run equilibrium.
