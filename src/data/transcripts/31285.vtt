00:01.173 --> 00:04.356
The child was born on October 14th, 1906.

00:05.237 --> 00:06.825
She's vivacious and cheery.

00:07.074 --> 00:08.696
She loves letters and books.

00:09.363 --> 00:12.930
When someone asks, "what's your name?", she says, "Haya Arendt."

00:13.385 --> 00:18.148
In 1924, the great philosopher Martin Heidegger...

00:18.316 --> 00:21.629
...recognized very soon that she was something special,...

00:21.865 --> 00:25.063
...and quickly they developed a personal relationship,...

00:25.282 --> 00:29.811
...which, in a strange way, lasted through Hannah Arendt's life.

00:30.620 --> 00:33.699
"For me as a Jew, Germany means my mother tongue,..."

00:34.192 --> 00:35.703
"...philosophy and literature."

00:36.020 --> 00:39.176
I think non-thinking is even more dangerous.

00:39.319 --> 00:45.137
It is this non-thinking adoption of fascist, racist ideologies,...

00:45.249 --> 00:47.441
...which she is saying became normal,...

00:47.698 --> 00:50.179
...which is why we have to be all the more alert.

00:52.736 --> 00:56.510
She saw Eichmann as the little man, the bureaucrat.

00:56.668 --> 00:57.717
People went berserk.

00:57.903 --> 01:01.334
As late as ten years ago, I'd give a lecture on "Eichmann in Jerusalem."

01:01.516 --> 01:04.365
Somebody in the audience would get up and start screaming at me.

01:05.097 --> 01:07.003
"If I hadn't wanted to become respectable,..."

01:07.085 --> 01:10.027
"...I would have either have had to give up my interest in Jewish affairs..."

01:10.245 --> 01:14.117
"...or not marry a non-Jewish man, either option equally inhuman."

01:14.491 --> 01:16.311
"For many years, we have met Germans..."

01:16.385 --> 01:18.658
"...who declare they are ashamed of being Germans."

01:18.791 --> 01:22.231
"I've often felt tempted to answer that I am ashamed of being human,..."

01:22.373 --> 01:26.243
"...that all nations share the onus of evil committed by all others."

01:26.383 --> 01:28.578
She doesn't fit any traditional categories.

01:28.715 --> 01:31.784
She's not a classical liberal, she's not a classic Marxist,...

01:31.988 --> 01:33.512
...she's not a classic conservative.

01:33.798 --> 01:35.753
She has enjoyed such renown...

01:36.085 --> 01:38.322
...precisely because she was an independent thinker.

01:39.251 --> 01:41.129
The life,  the life she led,...

01:41.538 --> 01:45.229
...she has become like a prophet out of the Hebrew Bible.
