ï»¿You are unique.

00:04.505 --> 00:05.720
You are different.

00:06.317 --> 00:07.857
You are special.

00:11.104 --> 00:12.572
We definitely get that.

00:14.153 --> 00:16.517
We understand everything about you,...

00:17.996 --> 00:20.485
...especially the way you talk online,...

00:20.764 --> 00:25.606
...like totes, BRB, and "join the conversation."

00:26.739 --> 00:27.679
You say that, right?

00:29.373 --> 00:31.861
The point is, you are free,...

00:32.909 --> 00:35.032
...free from words with vowels in them,...

00:35.787 --> 00:38.585
...free from the restraints of natural hair color.

00:39.097 --> 00:41.399
Your hair is totally pink.

00:41.812 --> 00:43.743
You dance all the time,...

00:43.926 --> 00:48.892
...on the street, in your room, and definitely with your eclectic group of friends.

00:50.026 --> 00:52.577
Wow, Ephraim plays the ukulele!

00:52.895 --> 00:54.195
That's unexpected...

00:54.283 --> 00:58.257
...but that's just how millennials roll, according to our thought leaders.
