I grew up in the United States but to a very traditional Chinese family.

00:04.808 --> 00:08.026
And I got married at the very old age of 38,...

00:08.119 --> 00:10.124
...or at least it's considered very old in China.

00:10.489 --> 00:13.816
From the time I graduated from college, at 21 to 38,...

00:13.963 --> 00:16.233
...every week, my mom will be calling me and say,...

00:16.478 --> 00:17.523
"Do you have a boyfriend yet?"

00:17.653 --> 00:18.750
"When are you gonna get married?"

00:18.825 --> 00:20.291
you know, getting very nervous.

00:20.637 --> 00:22.708
At one point, I was the Deputy Mayor in Los Angeles,...

00:22.791 --> 00:25.459
...she'll still be calling and say, "Why are you being a Deputy Mayor?"

00:25.549 --> 00:26.977
"What man is going to want you now?"

00:27.845 --> 00:32.353
I say, "Well mom, I'm trying to help millions of people have a better life..."

00:32.453 --> 00:33.718
"...and contribute more to the economy."

00:33.808 --> 00:37.151
and she say, "But don't you know a woman's most important role...

00:37.244 --> 00:38.464
...is to be a wife and mother?"

00:39.640 --> 00:42.515
When I talk to my friends here in China,...

00:42.673 --> 00:46.077
...the one thing that I hear probably more than anything else...

00:46.253 --> 00:48.540
...is, "I have so much pressure in my life."

00:48.797 --> 00:53.219
Young women often say, their parents do not allow them to date through high school,...

00:53.433 --> 00:55.018
...not want them to date through college,...

00:55.111 --> 00:57.876
...but the second they graduated from college, they want them to get married.

00:58.560 --> 01:02.432
There's been a tradition in let's say Western Europe...

01:02.539 --> 01:06.842
...of individual rights, protests for maybe 500 years.

01:07.061 --> 01:09.009
In China, there never has been that.

01:10.167 --> 01:16.030
There's still been this sort of unifying culture of the women's role.

01:17.305 --> 01:21.961
These women are some of the most educated people in the world right now.

01:22.182 --> 01:25.560
And yet, all of their cultural inculcation...

01:25.663 --> 01:29.050
...has been to look at themselves as wives and mothers.

01:29.809 --> 01:34.323
They look at me and say, "Wow, society wants me to go in this direction."

01:34.539 --> 01:37.227
But just by having her out there as a data point,...

01:37.396 --> 01:40.772
...I just felt like the possibilities ahead of me just expanded.
