00:14.636 --> 00:17.433
A long-lost king taking back his throne.

00:18.131 --> 00:21.217
On their own, any of these make great stories,...

...but each is just one episode in the "Odyssey,"...

00:25.512 --> 00:30.053

00:59.367 --> 01:03.075
...as these poets combined existing stories, jokes, myths,...

01:03.245 --> 01:05.593
...and songs into a single narrative.
