00:00.725 --> 00:05.495
The "Odyssey" itself is a sequel to Homer's other famous epic, the "Iliad,"...

00:05.901 --> 00:07.917
...which tells the story of the Trojan War.

00:08.552 --> 00:12.287
If there's one major theme uniting both poems, it's this:...

00:12.816 --> 00:17.331
...Do not, under any circumstances, incur the wrath of the gods.

00:18.073 --> 00:21.191
The Greek Pantheon is a dangerous mix of divine power....

00:21.278 --> 00:25.973
...and human insecurity, prone to jealousy and grudges of epic proportions.

00:26.603 --> 00:29.361
And many of the problems faced by humans in the poems...

00:29.709 --> 00:31.246
...are caused by their hubris,...

00:31.631 --> 00:35.630
...or excessive pride in believing themselves superior to the gods.

00:36.675 --> 00:40.113
The "Odyssey" recounts all of Odysseus's years of travel,...

00:40.595 --> 00:44.527
...but the narrative begins in medias res, in the middle of things.

00:45.339 --> 00:49.787
Ten years after the Trojan War, we find our hero trapped on an island,...

00:50.306 --> 00:52.265
...still far from his native Ithaca...

00:52.363 --> 00:55.140
...and the family he hasn't seen for 20 years.

00:55.951 --> 01:00.723
Because he's angered the sea god Poseidon by blinding his son, a Cyclops,...

01:01.076 --> 01:04.933
...Odysseus's passage home has been fraught with mishap after mishap.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.521
With trouble brewing at home and gods discussing his fate,...

01:09.040 --> 01:12.967
...Odysseus begins the account of those missing years to his hosts.

01:13.789 --> 01:16.400
One of the most fascinating things about the "Odyssey"...

01:16.509 --> 01:19.822
...is the gap between how little we know about its time period...

01:20.341 --> 01:23.595
...and the wealth of detail the text itself contains.

01:24.385 --> 01:28.065
Historians, linguists, and archeologists have spent centuries...

01:28.238 --> 01:29.818
...searching for the ruins of Troy...

01:30.199 --> 01:32.875
...and identifying which islands Odysseus visited.
