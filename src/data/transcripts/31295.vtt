00:00.819 --> 00:04.081
ï»¿Plato argued that beyond our imperfect world...

00:04.411 --> 00:07.613
...was a perfect unchanging world of Forms.

00:08.451 --> 00:12.219
Forms are the ideal versions of the things and concepts...

00:12.483 --> 00:13.497
...we see around us.

00:14.095 --> 00:17.451
They serve as a sort of instruction manual to our own world.

00:18.105 --> 00:21.663
Floating around the world of Forms is the ideal tree,...

00:21.955 --> 00:27.427
...and the ideal YouTube channel, and even the ideal justice or ideal love.

00:28.144 --> 00:33.257
Our own reality is comprised of imperfect copies of ideal Forms.

00:33.833 --> 00:37.433
Plato argued that philosophers should strive to contemplate...

00:37.553 --> 00:40.097
...and understand these perfect Forms...

00:40.488 --> 00:43.830
...so that they may better navigate our misleading reality.

00:44.422 --> 00:48.463
While it may seem silly, the disconnect between the world as it appears...

00:48.713 --> 00:50.262
...and the greater truth behind it...

00:50.633 --> 00:53.254
...is one of philosophy's most vexing problems.

00:53.847 --> 00:57.059
It's been the subject of thousands of pages by theologians,...

00:57.310 --> 00:59.964
...philosophers and screenwriters alike.

01:00.556 --> 01:03.450
It raises questions like should we trust our senses...

01:03.529 --> 01:05.983
...to come to the truth or our own reason?

01:06.768 --> 01:08.880
For Plato, the answer is reason.

01:09.287 --> 01:12.021
It alone provides us with at least the potential...

01:12.321 --> 01:13.655
...to contemplate the Forms.
