00:00.975 --> 00:02.805
The founding father of Greek philosophy, Socrates,...

00:03.085 --> 00:05.228
...is portrayed in the dialogues of Plato...

00:05.623 --> 00:09.105
...as hugely pessimistic about the whole business of democracy.

00:09.588 --> 00:13.562
In book six of The Republic, Plato describes Socrates falling into...

00:13.664 --> 00:16.396
...conversation with a character called Adeimantus...

00:16.729 --> 00:19.267
...and trying to get him to see the flaws of democracy...

00:19.567 --> 00:21.993
...by comparing a society to a ship.

00:22.363 --> 00:25.332
"If you were heading out on a journey by sea," asked Socrates,...

00:25.673 --> 00:28.773
..."who would you ideally want deciding who was in charge of the vessel?"

00:29.192 --> 00:33.569
"Just anyone or people educated in the rules and demands of seafaring?"

00:33.997 --> 00:36.269
"The latter, of course," says Adeimantus.

00:36.601 --> 00:39.091
"So why then," responds Socrates, "do we keep thinking...

00:39.175 --> 00:41.409
...that any old person should be fit to judge...

00:41.650 --> 00:43.487
...who should be the ruler of a country?"

00:44.103 --> 00:47.521
Socrates' point is that voting in an election is a skill...

00:47.827 --> 00:49.345
...not a random intuition,...

00:49.744 --> 00:53.261
...and like any skill, it needs to be taught systematically to people.

00:53.737 --> 00:56.102
Letting the citizenry vote without an education...

00:56.332 --> 00:58.771
...is as irresponsible as putting them in charge...

00:58.840 --> 01:01.855
...of a trireme sailing to Samos in a storm.
