00:00.321 --> 00:01.561
My name is Fiona Maye,...

00:02.814 --> 00:04.842
...but in court, it's "My Lady."

00:07.134 --> 00:08.302
I am always too busy.

00:08.545 --> 00:09.827
The law can take over your life.

00:10.601 --> 00:11.347
You're coming to bed?

00:12.505 --> 00:13.857
It's tomorrow, the case.

00:14.777 --> 00:15.188
Okay.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.480
My Lady, they're ready for you.

00:18.425 --> 00:19.234
Court rise!

00:20.987 --> 00:21.129
Yeah!

00:21.291 --> 00:22.563
We have urgent case, My Lady.

00:23.501 --> 00:25.577
The applicant Adam has leukemia.

00:25.840 --> 00:28.332
However, the boy and his parents are Jehovah's Witnesses...

00:28.413 --> 00:31.255
...and it's contrary to their faith to accept blood into their system.

00:31.960 --> 00:34.104
I would like to hear from Adam himself.

00:34.398 --> 00:35.863
So you've come to change my mind.

00:36.689 --> 00:38.773
Why is a blood transfusion wrong?

00:39.001 --> 00:39.974
Why is anything wrong?

00:40.215 --> 00:43.180
Tortured,  dying, being unfaithful in your marriage.

00:43.466 --> 00:45.509
What is the point of your silence?

00:47.403 --> 00:49.891
People think you've been influenced by your parents.

00:50.358 --> 00:52.001
Somehow, I've got to decide.

00:52.846 --> 00:56.849
The child's welfare shall be the court's paramount consideration.

00:57.441 --> 01:00.151
Life is more precious than dignity.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.793
My Lady, I've got so many questions for you.

01:03.039 --> 01:04.484
I think you've brought me close to something.

01:04.751 --> 01:06.541
My delicious adventure.

01:08.543 --> 01:09.841
Fi, talk to me.

01:10.697 --> 01:13.683
This young man thought I could answer all his questions.

01:13.975 --> 01:15.631
He's just a child.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.270
Lovely boy.

01:23.152 --> 01:26.129
Adam, remember all of life and love.

01:27.727 --> 01:29.981
It's a day of anguish at the Royal Court of Justice.

01:32.135 --> 01:33.304
My Lady, they're ready for you.
