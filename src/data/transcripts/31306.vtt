ï»¿Are we all born the same?

00:17.459 --> 00:19.253
Do we share the same dreams?

00:27.425 --> 00:28.787
What is expected of us?

00:42.345 --> 00:44.165
Will love always be carefree?

00:54.475 --> 00:56.380
Through whose eyes do we see ourselves?

01:07.861 --> 01:09.897
Do we have an expiry date?

01:14.059 --> 01:16.673
And if we haven't ticked all the right boxes,...

01:17.247 --> 01:19.547
...are we worth less after turning thirty?

01:33.332 --> 01:34.614
Or can things be different?

01:43.370 --> 01:45.139
Can we decide for ourselves...

01:55.251 --> 01:55.853
...who we are,...

02:02.237 --> 02:03.760
...who we aspire to be,...

02:10.396 --> 02:11.960
...what really matters...

02:19.585 --> 02:21.865
...and the messages we pass on to others?

02:26.133 --> 02:30.015
Can we change destiny by changing our thoughts?
