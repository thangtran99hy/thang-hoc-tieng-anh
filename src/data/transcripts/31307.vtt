I think what people don't realize is that even in your 30s,...

00:04.593 --> 00:06.265
...we're still just getting started.

00:06.424 --> 00:06.845
Totally.

00:07.229 --> 00:10.029
There's only one way to live and it's forward...

00:10.385 --> 00:13.743
...and every year I'm celebrating that I'm alive...

00:13.895 --> 00:15.379
...and you can't do this thing backwards...

00:15.440 --> 00:17.205
...so I'm embracing everything that comes with it.

00:17.283 --> 00:19.169
People always ask me, "How are you so confident?"

00:19.549 --> 00:21.447
I'm like, this didn't happen overnight,...

00:21.671 --> 00:24.758
....it's like, it took me 30 years to be so comfortable in my own skin.

00:24.933 --> 00:26.986
As much as we are like, "Ooh, we've made it,..."

00:27.085 --> 00:28.444
"...we're past age pressure."

00:28.585 --> 00:30.420
It's like, we're still gonna have those feelings...

00:30.516 --> 00:32.092
...because it's programmed in us to have them.

00:32.207 --> 00:36.300
But now, we have the tools to deal with them in a healthier manner...

00:36.680 --> 00:39.341
...instead of crumbling under that pressure...

00:39.437 --> 00:40.899
...and having it dictate your life.
