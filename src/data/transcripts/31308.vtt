00:00.350 --> 00:05.617
We begin at Troy, besieged by King Agamemnon and his Greek army.

00:06.099 --> 00:09.699
The stubborn king offends Achilles, the Greeks' best warrior,....

00:09.987 --> 00:12.817
...by claiming his spoil of war, the maiden Briseis.

00:13.447 --> 00:17.021
Achilles leaves the battlefield, honor affronted,...

00:17.495 --> 00:20.117
...so Achilles' mother, Thetis, asks Zeus...

00:20.615 --> 00:22.657
...to let the Trojans have the upper hand...

00:22.915 --> 00:25.202
...to show the Greeks they need her son.

00:26.137 --> 00:30.118
For now, there's a truce, although Paris, a lover not a warrior,...

00:30.341 --> 00:33.029
...is almost killed in a duel with Helen's husband.

00:34.105 --> 00:36.459
Heading into battle, Trojan champion Hector...

00:36.761 --> 00:39.750
...says an emotional goodbye to his wife and child.

00:41.314 --> 00:44.029
The fighting resumes, spurred on by the gods,...

00:44.383 --> 00:45.855
...and the Trojans are winning.

00:46.735 --> 00:48.815
Achilles still refuses to fight,...

00:49.210 --> 00:50.994
...but the Greeks know their foes fear him.

00:51.407 --> 00:54.935
So his best friend Patroclus tries to fool the Trojans...

00:55.335 --> 00:56.901
...by wearing Achilles' armor...

00:57.581 --> 01:00.035
...and is killed in battle  by Hector.

01:01.223 --> 01:03.587
Enraged, Achilles vows revenge.

01:04.229 --> 01:08.345
Wearing armor, newly fashioned by Hephaestus the blacksmith god,...

01:08.801 --> 01:11.802
...he re-enters the battle and slays Hector.
