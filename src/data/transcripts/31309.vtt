ï»¿What is green building?

00:07.397 --> 00:10.384
It's an integrative process that focuses on the relationship...

00:10.535 --> 00:12.739
...between the built environment and the natural environment.

00:13.513 --> 00:16.169
Buildings can have both positive and negative impacts...

00:16.249 --> 00:16.997
...on their surroundings...

00:17.151 --> 00:19.027
...as well as the people who inhabit them every day.

00:19.904 --> 00:23.150
Reduced energy and water use, healthy indoor environmental quality,...

00:23.591 --> 00:26.612
...smart material selection and the building's effects on its site...

00:26.800 --> 00:28.553
...are key considerations of a green building.

00:29.617 --> 00:30.339
Sound familiar?

00:30.727 --> 00:31.101
It should,...

00:31.593 --> 00:34.026
...as these elements mirror the different credit categories...

00:34.124 --> 00:35.293
...within the LEED rating system.

00:37.088 --> 00:39.525
These buildings cause less harm, could do more good,...

00:39.789 --> 00:41.768
...which creates a more sustainable environment for all.

00:45.309 --> 00:48.193
LEED acts as a decision-making framework for project teams...

00:48.477 --> 00:49.797
...during the life cycle of a building,...

00:50.147 --> 00:54.011
...which includes planning, design, construction and operations.

00:54.650 --> 00:56.940
LEED rewards best practices, innovation...

00:57.211 --> 00:59.207
...and recognizes exemplary performance...

00:59.375 --> 01:00.854
...with different levels of certification.

01:02.411 --> 01:05.821
In other words, LEED is green building.
