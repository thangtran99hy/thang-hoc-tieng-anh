Making smart energy choices has become a way of life.

00:05.661 --> 00:08.137
Energy-saving bulbs, efficient windows,...

00:08.447 --> 00:10.179
...sealing all the gaps around doors,...

00:10.575 --> 00:11.953
...these are all smart choices.

00:12.277 --> 00:15.699
But what about the choices we make before a home is even built?

00:16.238 --> 00:19.041
How green a building is depends in part...

00:19.327 --> 00:21.045
...on the materials used to build it.

00:21.636 --> 00:24.542
Homes today are made of three common building materials:...

00:25.107 --> 00:27.211
...wood, steel and concrete.

00:27.691 --> 00:29.644
Wood may not be best for all buildings,...

00:30.079 --> 00:32.841
...but it does have many environmental advantages.

00:33.329 --> 00:37.402
Let's investigate: wood is a naturally renewable building material.

00:38.013 --> 00:42.082
Trees renew naturally from seed or are replanted by land managers...

00:42.465 --> 00:45.479
...which means we basically can have wood products forever.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.176
Trees pull carbon out of the air and hold on to it.

00:48.317 --> 00:48.737
Gotcha.

00:48.879 --> 00:52.267
Even after trees are made into lumber panels or furniture,...

00:52.592 --> 00:55.554
...the wood is still keeping carbon out of our atmosphere.

00:55.989 --> 00:59.319
Wood products require less water and energy to produce.

00:59.969 --> 01:05.217
Compared to wood, concrete requires 16 to 50% more energy to produce,...

01:05.965 --> 01:10.631
...and the production of steel requires 25 to 90% more energy than wood,...

01:11.033 --> 01:13.463
...and as much as 400% more water...

01:14.191 --> 01:16.922
...and the production of wood emits less carbon dioxide...

01:17.201 --> 01:18.611
...than steel or concrete.

01:20.031 --> 01:23.493
And finally, wood can often be grown and produced locally...

01:23.842 --> 01:26.401
...instead of across the country or across the world.

01:26.933 --> 01:28.215
Way to go Washington.

01:28.513 --> 01:31.121
So how do you choose the greenest building material?

01:31.590 --> 01:33.289
Easy, it's the one that's green.

01:34.213 --> 01:36.199
And that's the story on green building.
