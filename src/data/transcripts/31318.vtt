ï»¿A tube station in London has a problem.

00:08.757 --> 00:12.159
Each month, 15 people are injured on its escalators.

00:12.975 --> 00:15.877
But a surprising solution for the station has emerged.

00:16.877 --> 00:17.551
Wait for it.

00:18.547 --> 00:20.207
Hello everybody and please listen up.

00:20.351 --> 00:23.525
I said to my colleague that my wife was bringing down the two kids...

00:23.599 --> 00:24.611
...to meet me after work.

00:24.856 --> 00:28.425
Take care on the escalator, hold on to the handrail and your luggage.

00:29.653 --> 00:32.827
And he said, "Would Megan mind doing a PA announcement...

00:32.921 --> 00:35.121
...regarding the safety on the escalators?"

00:35.399 --> 00:38.179
She does like a bit of acting so I knew she'd be up for it.

00:40.677 --> 00:43.300
It took several takes to get the perfect recording.

00:44.007 --> 00:46.823
I was really nervous when I was first going to do it...

00:46.916 --> 00:50.072
...but then once I did it, I thought, "This is actually okay."

00:51.349 --> 00:54.385
Research shows that deeper adult voices...

00:54.487 --> 00:56.925
...are perceived by humans as having more authority.

00:57.115 --> 01:00.625
Take care on the escalator, hold on to the handrail and your luggage.

01:01.246 --> 01:03.613
A child's voice wouldn't have that authority...

01:04.039 --> 01:06.551
..but perhaps it's the shock factor.

01:07.143 --> 01:10.333
Megan's announcements have been running at the station for 6 months.

01:10.965 --> 01:14.831
Transport for London says injuries have fallen by almost two thirds.

01:15.939 --> 01:18.179
Do you think adults listen enough to children?

01:19.569 --> 01:20.104
No.

01:20.657 --> 01:22.573
They should listen more to children...

01:22.647 --> 01:24.889
...because sometimes children are right.
