00:01.379 --> 00:03.387
Every night during the holy month of Ramadan,...

00:03.620 --> 00:05.917
...Muslims around the world attend an iftar,...

00:06.269 --> 00:08.477
...a meal to break the day's religious fast,...

00:09.809 --> 00:13.845
...but in Iran's holy city of Mashhad, there is an iftar like no other.

00:14.817 --> 00:17.727
During the 30 days of Ramadan, the Imam Reza mosque...

00:17.941 --> 00:20.462
...hosts a break fast of epic proportions.

00:20.958 --> 00:25.765
Every night as the sun sets, thousands of meals are served to hungry observers.

00:33.028 --> 00:35.464
Cooking for that many people can be a daunting job,...

00:35.793 --> 00:38.620
...so they enlist the help of over 400 volunteers.

00:40.814 --> 00:44.340
To pull this off, the volunteer chefs start their day at 5 AM...

00:44.484 --> 00:47.747
...and spend most of their time chopping and stirring the evening's meal.

00:49.028 --> 00:52.205
But 13,000 meals means a lot of food.

00:52.902 --> 00:57.162
The mosque goes through two tons of fresh vegetables, four tons of rice...

00:57.345 --> 01:00.461
...and three tons of meat every single night.

01:03.673 --> 01:06.462
But despite the challenges, volunteers and patrons alike...

01:06.644 --> 01:09.578
...consider it a great honor to attend this special iftar.
