ï»¿Sunday in Bogota is a day of rest and relaxation...

00:06.633 --> 00:09.179
...and the best place to do it is La Candelaria.

00:10.061 --> 00:13.075
It's the oldest neighborhood in Bogota built in 1580...

00:13.693 --> 00:16.519
...and it's a perfect blend of history and charm.

00:19.947 --> 00:22.425
La Candelaria has everything that I love:...

00:22.967 --> 00:25.599
...narrow cobblestone streets, colorful cafes...

00:25.827 --> 00:27.613
...and lots of peaceful squares.

00:28.658 --> 00:31.700
One of my favorites is Plaza del Chorro de Quevedo,...

00:32.123 --> 00:34.411
...smaller than the main Plaza de Bolivar...

00:34.617 --> 00:36.427
...and teeming with street art.

00:38.210 --> 00:42.407
All of the handicraft shops are worth a visit and the churches.

00:47.987 --> 00:49.507
And you've got to take a lunch break...

00:49.675 --> 00:52.714
...to try the most popular dish in this Colombian capital city,...

00:52.988 --> 00:56.753
...ajia, a thick, hearty soup typically made with chicken,...

00:56.930 --> 00:58.279
...potatoes, corn and herbs.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.664
With an average temperature of 58 degrees,...

01:02.009 --> 01:04.351
...soups are always on the menu in Bogota.

01:08.209 --> 01:10.251
Around every corner in La Candelaria,...

01:10.363 --> 01:12.332
...you will discover something magical.

01:12.716 --> 01:14.639
This is Plaza de Bolivar.

01:19.296 --> 01:22.091
Every square you visit around the world has its own character...

01:22.269 --> 01:24.403
...and Plaza de Bolivar is full of little moments.

01:25.263 --> 01:26.643
You've got people selling drinks,...

01:26.917 --> 01:30.379
...kids running with the pigeons, llamas walking around...

01:31.605 --> 01:33.387
...and this beautiful backdrop of the cathedral.

01:35.246 --> 01:37.357
La Candelaria inspires a sense of calm,...

01:37.698 --> 01:39.593
...a low-key, lovely neighborhood...

01:39.999 --> 01:43.317
...where Sundays and every day just seem right.
