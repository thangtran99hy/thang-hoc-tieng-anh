00:01.121 --> 00:02.429
I'm looking for a story,...

00:03.589 --> 00:04.733
...a place to spark it.

00:08.508 --> 00:10.465
I was always encouraged to look beyond,...

00:12.269 --> 00:13.431
...to cross frontiers.

00:16.541 --> 00:18.723
Life is not just a ride you jump on.

00:20.468 --> 00:21.919
You make it your own.

00:22.917 --> 00:24.070
You open trails.

00:25.254 --> 00:28.011
I work hard on not letting things become familiar.

00:29.381 --> 00:33.707
I love strange territories, the heartbeat of uncertainty,...

00:34.704 --> 00:36.649
...the constant change of the landscape.

00:39.942 --> 00:41.527
I seek the soul of people,...

00:42.479 --> 00:45.147
...not what they do, but who they are.

00:51.434 --> 00:53.327
Traveling helps me to keep perspective,...

00:53.655 --> 00:54.894
...remember what's important:...

00:55.074 --> 00:57.197
...the beauty of a flower, of a smile.

00:57.473 --> 00:59.490
I was taught not to take things for granted,...

00:59.817 --> 01:03.681
...to treasure every breath I take, to taste every flavor.

01:04.461 --> 01:06.664
Each moment triggers my next step,...

01:07.738 --> 01:11.062
...passion, inspiration, new places, new sensations...

01:11.334 --> 01:14.681
...are all relentless, addictive things I pump into my blood.

01:16.630 --> 01:18.561
Each mile walked, each new friend...

01:18.636 --> 01:20.255
...are the things I treasure the most.

01:21.497 --> 01:24.407
I can have nothing but that, yet that is so much.

01:27.497 --> 01:30.575
I pay tribute to life by enjoying the most simple things:...

01:33.864 --> 01:37.639
...unfamiliar habitats, strange encounters, facing fears...

01:37.731 --> 01:38.797
...and fearing nothing.

01:39.509 --> 01:41.707
I find myself living on a roller coaster...

01:42.400 --> 01:47.899
...and still have the time to stop and contemplate.

01:54.387 --> 01:56.933
I seek a unique experience to tell my story...

01:58.286 --> 01:59.580
...and I know where to start.
