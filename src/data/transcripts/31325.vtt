00:00.974 --> 00:05.794
Rain is rare in Choapa province, Chile, just south of the Atacama Desert.

00:06.299 --> 00:09.483
Just 50 millimeters fall per year on average.

00:09.985 --> 00:11.783
What they do get here is fog.

00:12.303 --> 00:15.958
With the decade-long drought straining the already limited water supply,...

00:16.306 --> 00:18.195
...these fog catchers are a salvation...

00:18.507 --> 00:21.259
...says agricultural engineer Pedro Hernandez.

00:21.583 --> 00:26.518
As the fog drifts over the hills, these mesh nets capture droplets of water,...

00:26.913 --> 00:28.295
...which drip into a collector.

00:29.056 --> 00:31.989
They provide enough water to sustain a new olive grove.

00:32.357 --> 00:35.065
It has been a lifeline for farmer Ricardo Alvarez.

00:35.297 --> 00:38.481
Alvarez says the olives provide a future for the next generation...

00:38.665 --> 00:40.041
...and could save his community.

00:40.808 --> 00:43.901
Scientists say these fog harvesters could work better.

00:44.437 --> 00:48.579
Most are made of mesh netting says Virginia Tech engineer Jonathan Boryeko.

00:48.769 --> 00:50.859
The problem with that is if the netting is too big,...

00:51.140 --> 00:52.647
...the droplets sail right through the holes,...

00:52.868 --> 00:55.814
...and if the netting is too small, the water gets clogged in the holes.

00:56.069 --> 00:58.925
So, either way, you lose; you're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place.

00:59.052 --> 01:02.255
Boryeko and colleagues have developed what they call a fog harp.

01:02.711 --> 01:04.631
It has no horizontal wires.

01:04.868 --> 01:08.296
Nothing to get in the way as gravity pulls water droplets down.

01:09.006 --> 01:11.743
It captures three times more water than a mesh net.

01:12.484 --> 01:15.811
Another way to make the mesh work better: zap it with electricity...

01:15.990 --> 01:19.720
...says Massachusetts Institute of Technology engineer Kripa Varanasi.

01:19.970 --> 01:23.763
The electrical force then fundamentally changes the way...

01:23.839 --> 01:26.340
...droplets move instead of following the wind stream lines,...

01:26.407 --> 01:28.947
...they now follow electrical  field lines...

01:29.319 --> 01:33.357
...and a much larger percentage of these droplets now get captured.

01:33.631 --> 01:34.803
When the current switches on,...

01:34.988 --> 01:38.002
...hardly any mist can get past the electrified mesh.

01:38.531 --> 01:42.513
Varanasi's main goal is to collect mist from power plant cooling towers,...

01:43.029 --> 01:45.202
...but in cities like Cape Town, South Africa,...

01:45.382 --> 01:47.106
...where water is literally running out,...

01:47.530 --> 01:50.432
...he says the technology is far cheaper than other options...

01:50.511 --> 01:51.675
...like desalination.
