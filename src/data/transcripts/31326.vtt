00:03.075 --> 00:04.287
Ancient and modern,...

00:05.006 --> 00:06.019
...rich and poor,...

00:06.696 --> 00:08.515
...fascinating and entertaining,...

00:09.280 --> 00:10.743
...practical and elegant,...

00:12.008 --> 00:14.397
...Lima is a city of contrasts.

00:22.644 --> 00:24.871
Almost a third of all Peruvians...

00:25.006 --> 00:27.114
...call this sprawling metropolis home,...

00:27.570 --> 00:30.596
...and they live in everything from modern high-rise condos...

00:30.995 --> 00:32.737
...to humble hilltop shacks.

00:33.875 --> 00:36.813
The painted facades burst with color in summer,â€¦

00:37.324 --> 00:40.185
...but this image is paled by the fog that rises...

00:40.426 --> 00:42.316

00:45.696 --> 00:49.184
In this ever-changing city, you can find a new surprise...

00:49.262 --> 00:50.331
...at every turn.

00:50.757 --> 00:52.792
All you have to do is prepare your senses.

00:53.283 --> 00:55.333
Along the boulevards of central Lima,...

00:55.479 --> 00:58.458
...you'll be immersed in the sounds of chaotic traffic,...

00:59.061 --> 01:02.017
...while quiet benches await in coastal parks.

01:07.670 --> 01:09.035
Everywhere you go in Lima,...

01:09.290 --> 01:12.378
...you can feel the hot desert sun warm your skin,...
