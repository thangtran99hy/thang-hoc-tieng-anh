Barranco is one of Lima's trendy neighborhoods.

00:02.788 --> 00:05.512
In the 80s, it was more of a Bohemian artist community...

00:05.813 --> 00:07.943
...and now it's very popular for young people...

00:08.039 --> 00:11.355
...for nightlife, for cafes, and it generally has a very cool vibe.

00:12.008 --> 00:15.133
Its artistic roots show on the walls, inside the shops...

00:15.292 --> 00:17.459
...and just in the general laid-back attitude...

00:17.605 --> 00:18.813
...of these homey streets.

00:19.031 --> 00:20.415
This neighborhood is really trendy right now,...

00:20.503 --> 00:22.280
...but it still kind of feels like a walk back in time.

00:22.933 --> 00:25.221
There was something nostalgically old-fashioned...

00:25.326 --> 00:28.143
...about Barranco, which I think is what makes it so popular,...

00:28.653 --> 00:30.725
...and its name translates to "cliff"...

00:31.156 --> 00:34.069
...as the area is actually located right along the cliff's edge.
