00:01.085 --> 00:03.993
Facebook results showing signs of strain Wednesday...

00:04.225 --> 00:08.118
...as it grapples with fallout from the massive Cambridge data scandal.

00:08.423 --> 00:12.757
In the first full quarter since the revelation, 87 million Facebook users...

00:13.014 --> 00:15.367
...had personal data shared without their permission.

00:15.757 --> 00:20.193
Growth and monthly active users came in below analysts' forecast.

00:20.491 --> 00:23.127
There was a noticeable fall in European users.

00:23.504 --> 00:26.909
Three million disappeared in the biggest drop ever...

00:27.210 --> 00:29.655
...due in part to new European Union rules,...

00:29.992 --> 00:32.714
...forcing changes to Facebook's privacy terms.

00:33.117 --> 00:35.403
And that wasn't the only disappointment.

00:35.750 --> 00:38.577
Quarterly sales at 13.2 billion dollars...

00:38.939 --> 00:41.946
...also failed to live up to Wall Street expectations.

00:42.359 --> 00:46.515
And a shocking forecast wiped out roughly 150 billion dollars...

00:46.587 --> 00:48.775
...in stock market value in after-hours trading,...

00:49.129 --> 00:53.496
...a complete reversal from the record high set during the regular session.

00:53.901 --> 00:55.577
The world's largest social network...

00:55.666 --> 01:00.699
...has been under nonstop scrutiny by government agencies in several countries...

01:01.103 --> 01:03.977
...and the subject of a "Delete Facebook" campaign,...

01:04.585 --> 01:08.739
...not just for the breach but for claims it helps promote hate speech...

01:09.019 --> 01:11.611
...and can be manipulated for political gain.

01:11.909 --> 01:13.807
In an effort to win back public trust,...

01:14.223 --> 01:18.235
...Facebook has pledged to spend more to improve content and security.

01:18.587 --> 01:20.676
That spending is hitting the bottom line.

01:20.926 --> 01:24.168
Spending grew faster than ad sales in the last quarter,...

01:24.575 --> 01:28.137
...leading to the weakest uptick in revenues in three years.
