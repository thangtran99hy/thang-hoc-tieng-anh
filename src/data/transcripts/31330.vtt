Salvador Dali's gift for self-publicity made him the first art superstar...

00:04.828 --> 00:05.881
...of the television age.

00:06.278 --> 00:08.127
Regarded by some of his peers as a sellout...

00:08.270 --> 00:10.106
...who didn't toe the line politically,...

00:10.536 --> 00:11.727
...he first made his name with art...

00:11.835 --> 00:14.297
...that mind his deepest fears and fixations.

00:14.791 --> 00:16.686
These surrealist paintings owed much...

00:16.809 --> 00:18.473
...to the theories of psychoanalysis,...

00:19.211 --> 00:21.458
...but there's more to Dali than these skillfully rendered...

00:21.647 --> 00:23.364
...fever dreams of sex and decay.

00:24.025 --> 00:26.482
He painted one of the 20th century's great crucifixions,...

00:26.796 --> 00:28.623
...but it's more about physics than religion...

00:29.273 --> 00:33.116
...and he was as influenced by philosophy as he was by Sigmund Freud.

00:33.713 --> 00:36.878
He strove to depict the unseen from the movement of atoms...

00:37.165 --> 00:38.845
...to the concept of a fourth dimension.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.934
It was one of the many interests he shared...

00:41.009 --> 00:42.787
...with his friend, Marcel Duchamp.

00:43.666 --> 00:45.702
Dali once said he would never really die.

00:46.192 --> 00:48.359
It's a sort of grandiose state that he was famous for,...

00:48.502 --> 00:51.695
...but it has a ring of truth for his enduring fame...

00:51.883 --> 00:56.447
...and his impact on popular culture has given him a kind of immortality.
