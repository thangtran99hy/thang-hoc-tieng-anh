A few years prior to Apple's launch of the iPhone,...

00:03.815 --> 00:06.269
...Son was visiting Steve Jobs in California...

00:06.339 --> 00:08.177
...and offered him sketches of a prototype device...

00:08.257 --> 00:11.937
...that combines functionalities of the iPod and a mobile phone.

00:12.080 --> 00:15.608
Knowing Apple was developing the iPhone, Jobs refused,...

00:15.867 --> 00:20.523
...so Masa got him to agree to exclusive rights for their product in Japan,...

00:20.711 --> 00:24.066
...bringing Softbank and Masa a lot of success.

00:24.222 --> 00:27.485
This wasn't his first big business deal however.

00:28.049 --> 00:30.848
While attending the University of California at Berkeley,...

00:31.056 --> 00:34.699
...he invented a digital translator and sold it to Sharp...

00:34.857 --> 00:38.119
...for 100 million yen or about a million dollars.

00:38.269 --> 00:42.801
Using that money, he founded Softbank, which is a household name in Japan...

00:42.963 --> 00:46.365
...and airs popular commercials with Tommy Lee Jones and a dog.

00:46.475 --> 00:51.325
For a brief period during the dot-com bubble, Masa was the world's richest man...

00:51.554 --> 00:55.065
...before 99 percent of his deals failed.

00:56.084 --> 01:00.415
At the center of his reputation is one very important transaction.

01:00.987 --> 01:04.636
In 2000, he made a 20-million-dollar investment...

01:04.734 --> 01:08.182
...in an unknown Chinese startup called Alibaba...

01:08.575 --> 01:11.312
...and a young founder named Jack Ma.

01:11.709 --> 01:16.646
"I could tell from the way he talks, the way he looks,..."

01:17.331 --> 01:19.516
"...he has charisma, he has leadership."

01:19.780 --> 01:24.900
Softbank's stake in Alibaba is now worth 138 billion dollars,...

01:25.159 --> 01:28.607
...one of the most lucrative venture investments of all time.
