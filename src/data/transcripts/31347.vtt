In 1894, Milton Hershey had an idea:...

00:03.453 --> 00:07.681
...make chocolate, which was a luxury for the rich, affordable for the masses.

00:09.325 --> 00:14.299
By 1909, Hershey Chocolate Company was the largest confectionery company in the US...

00:14.397 --> 00:15.880
...and dominated market share.

00:17.037 --> 00:18.236
But through the years,...

00:18.337 --> 00:21.324
...there's been increasing doubt about the ability of chocolate alone...

00:21.426 --> 00:22.815
...to support the Hershey Company.

00:23.045 --> 00:26.655
After half a century of being the only chocolate player in town,...

00:27.964 --> 00:30.201
...Mars became a tough competitor.

00:30.670 --> 00:32.793
The owner of M&M and Snickers forced Hershey...

00:32.872 --> 00:35.853
...to finally create a marketing department in the 1960s.

00:38.932 --> 00:42.387
There have also been  ebbs and flows and concerns about chocolate itself.

00:42.825 --> 00:47.117
Fears about caffeine led Hershey to build its tech center that still exists today.

00:47.646 --> 00:50.413
Hershey has, over the years, tried to buffer these risks.

00:50.927 --> 00:56.574
It's bought or owned Friendly's Ice Cream parlors, pasta, cookies, bars and nuts.

00:56.865 --> 00:57.675
None stuck.

00:58.355 --> 01:02.051
It considered buying Cadbury in England, but it was too expensive.
