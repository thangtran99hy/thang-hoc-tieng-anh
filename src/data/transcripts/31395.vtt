00:00.172 --> 00:03.871
US national debt is more than 21 trillion dollars.

00:04.079 --> 00:05.871
Yep, that's 12 zeros!

00:06.113 --> 00:07.465
Having trouble visualizing it?

00:07.621 --> 00:08.671
Well, think of it this way.

00:08.906 --> 00:13.532
You could wrap $1 bills around the Earth more than 80,000 times with that amount.

00:13.961 --> 00:14.982
So, how do we get here?

00:15.148 --> 00:16.475
Well, it's simple really.

00:16.799 --> 00:19.381
The government is spending more money than it's taking in.

00:19.630 --> 00:22.817
The government makes money in one key way: taxes.

00:23.040 --> 00:26.324
Your income or payroll taxes are revenue for the government.

00:26.725 --> 00:28.444
It then spends that money on things...

00:28.519 --> 00:31.005
...like social security, healthcare and defense.

00:31.136 --> 00:33.404
The catch is the government doesn't have enough revenue...

00:33.472 --> 00:35.718
...to pay for all of these programs at once,...

00:35.867 --> 00:38.747
...so it borrows money in the same way that you or I might.

00:39.176 --> 00:41.398
Without borrowing money, the government wouldn't be able...

00:41.475 --> 00:45.188
...to invest as much in education, national security and infrastructure.
