00:00.707 --> 00:02.709
Economists generally think it's okay for debt...

00:02.837 --> 00:05.045
...to increase when the economy needs a boost.

00:05.365 --> 00:06.372
You can see in this chart...

00:06.540 --> 00:09.491
...federal debt held by the public spiked during World War II...

00:09.587 --> 00:10.932
...and during the financial crisis,...

00:11.049 --> 00:13.554
...when the government borrowed money to boost the economy.

00:14.047 --> 00:16.900
The problem is that the federal debt is set to continue...

00:16.983 --> 00:19.981
...to increase to its highest level since 1946,...

00:20.205 --> 00:22.782
...even though the economy is now in much better shape.

00:23.149 --> 00:26.086
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is passed.

00:26.219 --> 00:30.483
One reason for this is a big law Congress passed at the end of 2017...

00:30.648 --> 00:33.123
...that lowered taxes without cutting spending,...

00:33.371 --> 00:35.576
...which will result in even more borrowing.

00:35.807 --> 00:38.091
Another reason the national debt is likely to grow?

00:38.479 --> 00:40.551
America's population is getting older.

00:40.867 --> 00:41.873
And that means the government...

00:41.993 --> 00:44.467
...will need to pay for more programs for its senior citizens.

00:44.815 --> 00:48.719
For example, spending will increase on Medicare, Medicaid and social security.
