ï»¿Well, have you ever been to Japan?

00:02.389 --> 00:02.763
I have, recently.

00:03.085 --> 00:03.363
Okay.

00:03.448 --> 00:07.307

00:08.571 --> 00:10.255
...and you're having the time of your life.

00:11.884 --> 00:14.872
And then, every day you go out and you eat good food and stuff.

00:15.853 --> 00:17.307
That's how I feel right now, like,...

00:17.493 --> 00:20.316
...I'm really looking forward to going to Tokyo.

I feel like I'm in a super-awesome, like,...

00:26.961 --> 00:29.091
...it's not home, it's like a super-awesome...

00:29.175 --> 00:31.299
...extended vacation that I don't want to leave.
