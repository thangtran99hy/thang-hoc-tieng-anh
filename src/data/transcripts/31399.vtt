ï»¿Back in Japan, baseball is the king of sport.

00:04.191 --> 00:07.864
Do you think for a few days maybe tennis will kind of make some headway...

00:07.937 --> 00:09.145
...with what you guys are doing here?

00:10.596 --> 00:11.730
Yeah, I hope so.

00:11.853 --> 00:17.705
I hope people are watching us today.

00:20.194 --> 00:25.336
Yeah, hopefully many people are cheering in support for us.

00:25.406 --> 00:31.267
And even here we saw, or I saw a lot of Japanese coming up for the tournament.

00:32.019 --> 00:37.717
It's good to have, you know, home support outside of Japan.

00:40.042 --> 00:45.194
Yeah, it's great news we're both in the semis.

00:46.956 --> 00:49.785
Yeah, hopefully we do well this week.
