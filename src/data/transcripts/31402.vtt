00:03.924 --> 00:05.728
If people say your dreams are crazy,...

00:08.327 --> 00:10.322
...if they laugh at what you think you can do,...

00:14.045 --> 00:14.465
...good.

00:15.973 --> 00:16.771
Stay that way...

00:19.129 --> 00:21.519
...because what nonbelievers fail to understand...

00:22.073 --> 00:24.493
...is that calling a dream crazy is not an insult,...

00:25.725 --> 00:26.717
...it's a compliment.

00:28.639 --> 00:30.873
Don't try to be the fastest runner in your school...

00:31.375 --> 00:32.727
...or the fastest in the world.

00:33.691 --> 00:35.052
Be the fastest ever.

00:36.355 --> 00:38.704
Don't picture yourself wearing OBJ's jersey.

00:39.429 --> 00:41.254
Picture OBJ wearing yours.

00:42.577 --> 00:45.648
Don't settle for homecoming queen or linebacker.

00:46.476 --> 00:46.953
Do both.

00:48.271 --> 00:53.255
Lose 120 pounds and become an Ironman after beating a brain tumor.

00:55.220 --> 00:59.503
Don't believe you have to be like anybody to be somebody.

01:01.129 --> 01:02.644
If you're born a refugee,...

01:02.957 --> 01:08.389
...don't let it stop you from playing soccer for the national team at age 16.

01:10.555 --> 01:13.161
Don't become the best basketball player on the planet.

01:14.034 --> 01:15.437
Be bigger than basketball.

01:17.231 --> 01:22.593
Believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything.

01:24.181 --> 01:27.333
When they talk about the greatest team in the history of the sport,...

01:28.365 --> 01:29.515
...make sure it's your team.

01:30.376 --> 01:33.677
If you have only one hand, don't just watch football,...

01:34.520 --> 01:36.963
...play it at the highest level.

01:38.097 --> 01:39.638
And if you're a girl from Compton,...

01:40.039 --> 01:41.671
...don't just become a tennis player,...

01:42.779 --> 01:44.656
...become the greatest athlete ever.

01:45.956 --> 01:47.984
Yeah, that's more like it.

01:50.179 --> 01:52.124
So, don't ask if your dreams are crazy,...

01:53.073 --> 01:54.463
...ask if they're crazy enough.
