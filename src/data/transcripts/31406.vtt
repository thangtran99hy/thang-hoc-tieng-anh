00:01.428 --> 00:06.361
The first Japanese player, male or female, from your country in history...

00:06.681 --> 00:08.116
...to win a grand slam final.

00:16.646 --> 00:19.410
I know it just happened Naomi and it's still sinking in...

00:19.553 --> 00:21.446
...but what does it mean to you?

00:22.701 --> 00:26.995
Well,  it was always my dream to play Serena in the U.S. Open finals....

00:27.664 --> 00:29.801
...so I'm really glad that I was able to do that...

00:29.924 --> 00:33.274
...and I'm really grateful I was able to play with you.

00:33.859 --> 00:34.556
Thank you.
