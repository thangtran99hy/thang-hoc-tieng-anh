00:00.621 --> 00:04.090
We start in a stadium built for the 2010 World Cup,...

00:07.081 --> 00:10.629
...but there's no action on the field, no crowd cheering in the stands,...

00:12.904 --> 00:16.553
...just a terrified scream from 300 feet above.

00:19.892 --> 00:23.581
It's a 262-foot free fall called the Big Rush,...

00:26.429 --> 00:30.124
...and what follows the drop, that 721-foot arc,...

00:30.432 --> 00:33.453
...makes it the tallest swing on earth.

00:33.993 --> 00:36.863
You're completely free falling; you relinquish all control.

00:37.720 --> 00:39.198
Want to take your game to new heights?

00:39.753 --> 00:43.164
Get your butt to South Africa to the coastal city of Durban...

00:43.759 --> 00:45.202
...and the Moses Mabhida Stadium.

00:49.283 --> 00:51.568
The journey up starts with a ride to the top of the dome,...

00:53.833 --> 00:56.955
...but you're still 352 steps from the Big Rush...

00:59.105 --> 01:04.119
...and that climb is so steep, so dizzy, they make you wear a safety line...

01:04.313 --> 01:05.615
...like you're scaling a mountain,...

01:08.470 --> 01:10.911
...but the freakiest part is the jump platform.

01:11.330 --> 01:14.076
Less than four feet wide, it's got just one railing...

01:14.422 --> 01:16.835
...and the winds up here hit 30 miles an hour.
