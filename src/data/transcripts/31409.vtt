There's always existed in Asia...

00:07.341 --> 00:08.879
...these hidden invisible fortunes...

00:08.975 --> 00:11.821
...and people who spend millions of dollars a year...

00:11.929 --> 00:14.953
...on the finest things in life but do it totally under the radar.

00:15.900 --> 00:17.387
How much of my book is based on reality?

00:17.539 --> 00:19.057
About a hundred and fifty percent.

00:20.614 --> 00:22.953
Couture week in Paris is the creme de la creme.

00:23.323 --> 00:25.672
We're talking about dresses that start in the tens of thousands...

00:25.776 --> 00:26.981
...and go up to the millions.

00:27.394 --> 00:28.963
And only about 2 thousand women in the world...

00:29.059 --> 00:30.010
...can afford to dress this way.

00:30.733 --> 00:32.529
I was lucky enough to spend couture week in Paris...

00:32.613 --> 00:34.473
...with some truly stylish insiders.

00:35.363 --> 00:36.362
Heart Evangelista.

00:36.759 --> 00:38.437
She's really the darling of the Philippines.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.840
She's one of their most acclaimed actresses.

00:41.004 --> 00:42.841
She's also a really gifted artist.

00:42.934 --> 00:47.028
She's had amazing museum shows in the Philippines of her paintings.

00:51.574 --> 00:53.835
And then there's the Yeoh sisters, Michelle and Rachel...

00:53.973 --> 00:55.697
...who are so much wiser than their years.

00:55.812 --> 00:58.091
They grew up in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia...

00:58.525 --> 01:00.828
...but for the last, i think, 7 or 8 years have been living in England.

01:01.131 --> 01:03.439
Thank you for organizing Dior, so I could come with you guys.

01:03.500 --> 01:04.883
No, we're so excited.

01:05.073 --> 01:06.447
It's such a pleasure to have you.

01:06.877 --> 01:09.511
Such a last minute surprise, like "Cool I get to come with you guys."

01:09.610 --> 01:10.703
I guess that's part of Fashion Week.

01:10.879 --> 01:12.333
Everything is always last minute.

01:12.414 --> 01:12.851
Exactly.

01:15.857 --> 01:18.826
Feiping Chang is this dynamo.

01:19.003 --> 01:22.317
She, I think, was raised partially in Sydney and in Singapore.

01:22.410 --> 01:24.023
She now makes Hong Kong her home.

01:24.159 --> 01:26.385
Where she's become one of the most important...

01:26.523 --> 01:28.859
...fashion influencers in Asia.

01:29.036 --> 01:30.721
It's always nice coming back to Fashion Week.

01:30.844 --> 01:33.321
And you join your fashion family and see everybody.

01:33.975 --> 01:35.329
It's always a nice little reunion.

01:37.278 --> 01:40.428
I don't think Americans, for the most part, really understand...

01:40.567 --> 01:43.658
...how this level of Asian women shop.

01:45.837 --> 01:47.468
When I see something come down the runway...

01:47.537 --> 01:51.065
...I know in my gut and in my heart that it's meant to be.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.365
I think that connection makes everything more special.

01:53.751 --> 01:56.160
Everything's really about the private experience.

01:56.507 --> 01:59.524
Couture itself was made to make the client feel special.

01:59.619 --> 02:00.982
It's made for you.

02:01.274 --> 02:02.975
Going to these very exclusive fashion shows...

02:03.069 --> 02:04.407
...and then going for your private fittings.

02:08.043 --> 02:10.437
...where they meet jewelers and select stones...

02:10.537 --> 02:13.915
...and really being in that world of helping to create what they buy.

02:14.169 --> 02:15.847
So the spending is on a whole other level.
