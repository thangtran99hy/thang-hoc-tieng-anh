Every piece of every product that we use in our day-to-day lives...

00:03.928 --> 00:05.350
...was created by someone.

00:06.161 --> 00:10.105
But even the greatest, most inspired maker can't imagine everything,...

00:10.541 --> 00:12.301
...can't anticipate every need.

00:12.864 --> 00:17.411
That's why it's so important for us to work in diverse teams of individuals...

00:17.601 --> 00:20.275
...who bring their own distinct world view to their work,...

00:20.745 --> 00:24.431
...their needs and preferences, their opinions and experiences,...

00:24.595 --> 00:26.434
...their knowledge and expertise.

00:27.057 --> 00:30.777
This diversity of perspectives is the recipe for great products.

00:31.389 --> 00:35.611
Envision a place where the folks who make the things that power our lives...

00:35.761 --> 00:39.032
...are a true reflection of our community and our world.

00:39.511 --> 00:43.672
Imagine what awesome things they could build to better serve us all.
