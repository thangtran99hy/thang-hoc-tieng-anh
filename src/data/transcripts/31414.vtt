ï»¿Hey!

00:05.206 --> 00:06.547
Look at where we are.

00:06.679 --> 00:10.560
We are at a beautiful park, and look at what we have!

00:11.065 --> 00:12.253
Yum!

00:12.507 --> 00:15.682
A tasty lunch, like this grape.

00:18.563 --> 00:19.821
This raspberry.

00:23.560 --> 00:24.721
A red strawberry.

00:28.743 --> 00:30.913
And we have some vegetables.

00:31.175 --> 00:32.781
A sandwich, crackers.

00:33.188 --> 00:35.211
But we'll get to this in a little bit.

00:35.378 --> 00:36.320
Let's go play first.

00:36.483 --> 00:37.058
Come on.

00:40.087 --> 00:43.297
Wow, this park is so beautiful.

00:43.470 --> 00:47.564
Like these plants, they just look like plants,...

00:47.815 --> 00:49.870
...but they're so beautiful to me.

00:50.085 --> 00:52.388
Look, they're so green and alive.

00:53.959 --> 00:56.015
And they smell so great.

00:56.497 --> 00:57.533
Wow!

00:57.941 --> 00:59.671
Hey, I'm kind of hungry.

01:00.021 --> 01:01.215
Let's go eat some more.
