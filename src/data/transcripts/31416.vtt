My name is Michelle Yeoh and I play Eleanor Young.

00:03.078 --> 00:05.006
My name is Henry Golding; I play Nick Young.

00:05.124 --> 00:07.371
This is the crazy rich guide to life.

00:10.359 --> 00:13.061
First, find out which is the best restaurant to go...

00:13.351 --> 00:16.171
...and then when you're there, you will have the best maitre d'...

00:16.311 --> 00:19.620
...who will be able to introduce special dishes that you saw on order...

00:19.742 --> 00:22.514
...or even better the chef himself will come out.

00:22.815 --> 00:27.320
If you're really crazy rich, you'd have the restaurant closed down...

00:27.653 --> 00:29.266
...and it'd be just be you and your partner,...

00:29.717 --> 00:33.420
...and it'll be very romantic and everything would be exquisite.

00:33.641 --> 00:37.001
When you go to the fancy three-star Michelin restaurant,...

00:37.165 --> 00:39.527
...everything is already placed in order.

00:39.685 --> 00:43.290
The concept is you work from outwards inwards.

00:43.785 --> 00:47.537
You've got to keep a sense of regality; don't get hammered.

00:48.093 --> 00:48.599
Good answer.

00:48.935 --> 00:50.652
Oh, what will we serve for dinner?

00:50.852 --> 00:54.273
Depends on the season, whether it's white truffles, caviar.

00:54.503 --> 00:56.951
When your host stands up, that's a signal...

00:57.046 --> 00:58.247
...that you can leave the party.

00:58.459 --> 00:59.381
Never too early.

00:59.564 --> 00:59.704
Yeah.

00:59.916 --> 01:01.856
Otherwise, that's a bad manner.

01:02.375 --> 01:04.995
How do you travel when you're a crazy rich Asian? Your private jet.

01:05.145 --> 01:05.681
Of course.

01:05.843 --> 01:06.021
Yeah.

01:06.433 --> 01:08.279
And you get to choose which private jet.

01:08.501 --> 01:12.663
When the crazy rich travel, we stay either in our own chain of hotels...

01:12.770 --> 01:16.651
...or if there is none available, we maybe buy the hotel that was there...

01:16.745 --> 01:17.967
...or the presidential suite.

01:18.257 --> 01:20.519
Some of the destinations that the crazy rich would visit...

01:20.637 --> 01:23.203
...would have to be some private island...

01:23.291 --> 01:27.238
...owned by an uncle or a friend.

01:27.608 --> 01:28.970
Anywhere you want to go really.

01:29.163 --> 01:32.921
Whatever your heart fancies that evening or that weekend, right?

01:33.153 --> 01:33.712
Exactly.

01:34.184 --> 01:37.746
Oh, all the top brands: Elie Saab, Giorgio Armani.

01:37.908 --> 01:38.549
Who else do you wear?

01:38.691 --> 01:43.656
I'm into my Dior, but it's like those exquisites, the fine fabrics.

01:43.920 --> 01:44.754
Yes, couture.

01:46.279 --> 01:50.576
In Asian culture, it's about entertaining business partners...

01:50.740 --> 01:53.623
...or making sure that every single family member is invited.

01:53.729 --> 01:55.213
Otherwise, they're going to be very upset.

01:55.415 --> 01:56.569
Family is number one.

01:56.775 --> 01:57.113
Budget?

01:57.373 --> 01:57.847
Forget that.

01:59.426 --> 02:01.294
It's not about how much money you have,...

02:01.707 --> 02:04.507
...it's how much you know how to appreciate what you have.

02:04.863 --> 02:10.227
Graciousness is beyond that of the actual number of zeros you have.

02:10.439 --> 02:13.045
Once you have money that you don't need to worry about,...

02:13.350 --> 02:14.552
...that's where graciousness overtakes.
