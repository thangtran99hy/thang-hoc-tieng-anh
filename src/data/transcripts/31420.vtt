00:02.308 --> 00:04.630
The art of Japanese swordsmanship.

00:09.865 --> 00:11.721
And kendo isn't just a sport.

00:14.513 --> 00:19.140
It symbolizes the nation's ancient culture and its way of conduct.

00:22.331 --> 00:25.462
Bushido originates from the moral code of samurai:

00:25.751 --> 00:29.368
...strict disciplines which stress loyalty, frugality...

00:29.462 --> 00:31.734
...and honor over wealth or even life.

00:32.176 --> 00:37.137
And you can actually witness many of its principles in how businesses operate here.

00:41.133 --> 00:43.652
Not just in corporate etiquette, like bowing,...

00:44.146 --> 00:48.025
...but the spirit of company loyalty and diligence of its workers...

00:48.095 --> 00:49.991
...contributed to Japan's success.

00:50.699 --> 00:54.620
But some say, traditional disciplines can also be a hindrance.

00:58.014 --> 00:59.815
Take the iPhone, for example.

01:00.159 --> 01:03.293
While Apple is very secretive about its suppliers,....

01:03.595 --> 01:06.476
...analysts say a lot of its parts are made in Japan.

01:07.170 --> 01:10.762
But rather than cashing in, many of the smaller manufacturers...

01:10.971 --> 01:13.911
...focus more on making the best products possible...

01:14.160 --> 01:15.790
...rather than the biggest profits.

01:16.430 --> 01:19.126
I don't think they are making so much profit.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.528
Though they may have a larger share,...

01:22.347 --> 01:25.055
...when you look into the components of the iPhone,...

01:25.545 --> 01:28.506
...maybe the Japanese has the majority of the shares.

01:29.004 --> 01:36.859
But whether that business is a profitable business or not is something different.

01:37.587 --> 01:41.379
Japan's biggest companies are also accused of making mistakes.

01:41.830 --> 01:46.208
While foreign rivals such as Apple have created brand loyalty,...

01:46.586 --> 01:50.539
...at the moment, Japanese firms are generally seen as "less cool."

01:51.245 --> 01:54.559
Experts reckon that this is down to a lack of innovation.

01:55.018 --> 01:59.312
Japanese companies, especially once they lack a major hit product,...

02:00.643 --> 02:03.313
...they start focusing on cutting cost,...

02:03.513 --> 02:07.164
...mainly not producing or creating innovative products.

02:07.604 --> 02:13.097
So, the weight is now geared to more cost reduction rather than innovation.

02:17.006 --> 02:20.582
Back at the dojo, training starts at a young age.

02:21.305 --> 02:24.113
Thousands of years of tradition get passed on.

02:24.823 --> 02:28.262
But, in the business world, the time frame is much shorter.

02:28.807 --> 02:30.057
And if they want to survive,..

02:30.492 --> 02:32.898
...then Japan's tech firms may need to get better...

02:33.019 --> 02:36.809
...at mixing the code of Bushido with the needs of consumerism.

02:37.893 --> 02:40.035
