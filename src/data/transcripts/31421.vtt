Toyota knows how to make cars.

00:06.327 --> 00:08.462
It does it so well it became the first company...

00:08.659 --> 00:10.357
...to produce more than 10 million a year.

00:11.926 --> 00:14.121
Its success is rooted in a special system...

00:14.692 --> 00:17.090
...and began what is now known as "Lean Manufacturing",...

00:17.543 --> 00:19.746
...an ethos emulated by companies around the world...

00:20.149 --> 00:22.727
...to make products faster, cheaper and better.

00:23.793 --> 00:26.205
Here's how Toyota changed the way we make things.

00:26.307 --> 00:27.935
Cousin Eiji would travel to the U.S....

00:28.042 --> 00:30.452
...with a veteran loom machinist, Taiichi Ohno.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.895
They visited Ford's River Rouge plant in Michigan...

00:34.181 --> 00:36.189
...and were impressed by the scale of the operation.

00:36.623 --> 00:38.745
But knew that in cash-strapped Japan companies...

00:38.851 --> 00:40.802
...didn't have the resources for such a system.

00:41.622 --> 00:43.850
Having months worth of stock sitting in a warehouse...

00:44.165 --> 00:46.215
...would tie up precious capital they didn't have.

00:47.176 --> 00:51.051
Instead, what truly impressed Ohno was a visit to a supermarket,...

00:51.359 --> 00:53.218
...a Piggly Wiggly according to legend.

00:53.825 --> 00:56.371
Japan didn't really have self-service stores at this point...

00:56.689 --> 00:58.129
...and he was struck by the way customers...

00:58.231 --> 01:01.205
...could choose exactly what they wanted, when they wanted.

01:01.714 --> 01:04.712
He decided to model his production line on a similar idea.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.573
With the supermarket formula, only enough parts...

01:07.666 --> 01:09.019
...were produced in the first phase...

01:09.115 --> 01:11.462
...to replace what was used in the 2nd and so on.

01:12.430 --> 01:15.495
This is where the "Just in Time" system really took shape.

01:18.182 --> 01:21.109
Toyota was able to eliminate much of the waste in Ford's system,...

01:21.407 --> 01:24.202
...making smaller numbers of parts to be used when it needed them,...

01:24.617 --> 01:26.868
...allowing the company to operate on a tighter budget.

01:27.849 --> 01:30.096
As part of this Ohno developed "Kanban"...

01:30.425 --> 01:32.952
... a sign based scheduling method which shows goods in,...

01:33.303 --> 01:35.107
...goods in production, and goods out.

01:35.697 --> 01:37.962
It's now seen as a precursor to bar codes.

01:38.704 --> 01:41.771
Ohno and Toyoda also noticed that American car companies...

01:42.081 --> 01:45.349
...were still employing many of Henry Ford's early production techniques.
