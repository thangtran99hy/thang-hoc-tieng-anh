00:00.459 --> 00:03.154
The idea of shipping started in 3rd century BC,...

00:03.458 --> 00:06.046
...when merchants realized that sending products over sea...

00:06.425 --> 00:08.683
...was cheaper and faster than by land.

00:09.283 --> 00:13.445
Early on, goods were loaded onto ships in sacks, barrels and wooden crates...

00:13.539 --> 00:16.485
...with scores of dockworkers squeezing them on decks...

00:16.563 --> 00:17.854
...or in tight spaces below.

00:18.589 --> 00:21.862
Ships often spent more time at ports than sailing.

00:22.402 --> 00:24.658
And not much changed until 1956.

00:25.451 --> 00:28.359
That's when American truck driver Malcolm McLane...

00:28.654 --> 00:33.093
...stacked 58 metal boxes on a ship going from New Jersey to Houston.

00:33.678 --> 00:36.986
This idea completely revolutionized the industry.

00:38.315 --> 00:40.643
The containers not only protected the products,...

00:40.997 --> 00:42.309
...but when the ships docked at ports,...

00:42.952 --> 00:46.870
...truck beds and freight trains could take them away without repackaging.

00:47.500 --> 00:50.511
Cargo could now be moved from purpose-built vessels...

00:50.741 --> 00:53.368
...to rail and roads in massive volumes,...

00:53.701 --> 00:57.232
...cutting transport cost by at least 75 percent.
