Hi, I'm Naomi Osaka.

00:06.355 --> 00:08.937
I'm 19 years old and I play for Japan.

00:09.306 --> 00:14.155
I started playing when I was three and I think I mainly started...

00:14.288 --> 00:15.711
...because my sister was playing...

00:15.830 --> 00:18.623
...and I think I just really wanted to beat my sister a lot...

00:18.697 --> 00:22.923
...and she was always better than me so we had like a one-sided rivalry.

00:23.541 --> 00:28.444
I beat my sister for the first time when I was around 16, I think,...

00:29.044 --> 00:30.713
...so not that long ago.

00:31.186 --> 00:36.150
When I first started the tour and playing the grand slams and stuff,...

00:36.903 --> 00:41.673
...I was really, really shy and I was kind of scared of everyone,...

00:43.174 --> 00:45.647
...but I really like the fact that the crowds were big...

00:46.016 --> 00:47.769
...and I like playing on the big stages...

00:47.881 --> 00:49.880
...and playing the best players in the world,...

00:49.985 --> 00:52.037
...so I think that kept me very motivated.

00:52.276 --> 00:56.508
My favorite player is still Serena and Federer,...

00:57.073 --> 00:58.541
...and I also really like Venus...

00:58.605 --> 01:01.079
...and I'm really grateful I got the chance to play her.

01:01.386 --> 01:03.345
I saw Federer twice yesterday,...

01:03.951 --> 01:07.059
...and I feel I almost knocked him out because I was running in the hallway.

01:07.508 --> 01:09.372
So I almost knocked him out one time...

01:09.456 --> 01:14.799
...but yeah, I feel like maybe they won't be around for that much longer,...

01:14.903 --> 01:17.676
...so just having the chance to see them live...

01:17.758 --> 01:22.440
...and just being born in the same time zone a little bit as well...

01:22.821 --> 01:26.668
...is really great and I hope to be one of them one day.

01:27.267 --> 01:31.175
I'm friends with Monica Shuai,...

01:32.969 --> 01:35.923
...the Japanese girls that can tolerate me,...

01:37.468 --> 01:38.950
...and then who else, Belinda.

01:39.493 --> 01:43.476
Oh, you know it would be bad if someone sees this and be like, "Why didn't she mention me?"

01:45.331 --> 01:47.031
I'd be glad if I have this many friends,...

01:47.105 --> 01:48.047
...so I'm just gonna cut it here.

01:48.999 --> 01:56.533
If I wasn't playing tennis, I would try to be a marine biologist maybe,...

01:56.731 --> 01:59.221
...but I heard that you have to be really good at math.

01:59.373 --> 02:00.825
So maybe that's not really,...

02:03.247 --> 02:05.951
...maybe I would try to be a physio or something...

02:06.766 --> 02:08.010
...because you get to be around.

02:09.220 --> 02:12.506
I just like sports, so maybe an agent in the end.

02:12.637 --> 02:13.224
I don't know.

02:13.709 --> 02:17.145
Follow me on social media because I'm awesome and unique.

02:18.142 --> 02:18.891
Oh my god.
