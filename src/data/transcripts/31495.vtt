00:03.521 --> 00:05.468
ï»¿So we went with one trainee at a time...

00:05.583 --> 00:08.772
...and it just means that we can kind of focus on their individual needs.

00:09.017 --> 00:11.195
So, they start when they come on board with myself...

00:11.498 --> 00:13.805
...and then slowly over time as they build up their confidence,...

00:13.927 --> 00:16.107
...into the final endpoint of transitioning them...

00:16.185 --> 00:18.367
...onto whatever it is they want to do afterwards.

00:22.836 --> 00:24.831
Obviously, I had nowhere to stay.

00:24.926 --> 00:27.907
I had no one in my life, no structure...

00:28.187 --> 00:34.375
...and I was very confused, very hurt and I had no confidence.

00:40.291 --> 00:43.091
The training here not only showed me how to make coffee,...

00:43.177 --> 00:45.251
...but it also showed me how to deal with people,...

00:45.336 --> 00:47.923
...and how to kind of get my own confidence back,...

00:48.043 --> 00:50.636
...how to put myself back in life as it were.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.103
Through our Pay It Forward wall,...

00:57.179 --> 01:02.117
...we've given away over 7,000 coffees and 5,000 meals, which is impact...

01:02.193 --> 01:03.335
...that we're super proud of so far.

01:06.837 --> 01:10.162
I think, for me, the thing was that people are intrinsically good...

01:10.310 --> 01:11.369
...if given the opportunity...

01:11.444 --> 01:15.140
...and I think our job is about helping other people escape that negative cycle.

01:21.431 --> 01:24.353
I didn't think I would ever get to the other side...

01:24.913 --> 01:31.055
...and now it seems like all my prayers and all my dreams, kind of being answered one by one.
