Toys "R" Us: It's become a sad subject.

00:04.210 --> 00:08.745
I never wanted to see the day where Toys "R" Us is a sad subject.

00:08.869 --> 00:10.143
I'm sure you've heard by now...

00:10.230 --> 00:13.195
...and if you haven't, I'm sorry I'm the one who had to break it to you,...

00:13.279 --> 00:15.569
...but Toys "R" Us is done,...

00:15.649 --> 00:16.891
...in the US, anyway.

00:17.001 --> 00:19.861
In Canada, a company called Fairfax bought them,...

00:19.925 --> 00:23.013
...so there's still going to be 80 of them spread across the country,...

00:23.126 --> 00:25.564
...but with the exception of that, it's over!

00:25.847 --> 00:32.032
As of this moment, they're in the process of closing 735 US locations...

00:32.160 --> 00:33.943
...and they're nearing the end of the process.

00:34.033 --> 00:35.777
Here's what happens when I call them.

00:36.061 --> 00:36.267
Here.

00:36.613 --> 00:38.081
Thank you for calling Toys "R" Us.

00:38.409 --> 00:41.487
We would like to thank you for shopping with us for over 70 years...

00:41.635 --> 00:45.205
...and we appreciate your kind expressions as we close our doors.

00:45.783 --> 00:49.139
As of March 23rd, Toys "R" Us will start liquidation.

00:49.730 --> 00:52.853
Here are a few frequently asked questions for your reference.

00:53.112 --> 00:56.050
And then they just talk about how they're not accepting gift cards...

00:56.117 --> 00:57.093
...and things like that.
