00:01.053 --> 00:03.063
And maybe I made a mistake yesterday,...

00:04.495 --> 00:06.692
...but yesterday's me is still me.

00:08.529 --> 00:14.087
Today, I am who I am with all of my faults and my mistakes.

00:15.815 --> 00:20.251
Tomorrow, I might be a tiny bit wiser...

00:21.141 --> 00:22.162
...and that would be me too.

00:24.158 --> 00:27.521
These faults and mistakes are what I am,...

00:28.136 --> 00:31.206
...making up the brightest stars in the constellation of my life.

00:33.083 --> 00:36.258
I have come to love myself for who I am...

00:37.055 --> 00:40.103
...for who I was and for who I hope to become.

00:42.970 --> 00:44.721
I'd like to say one last thing.

00:46.832 --> 00:49.985
So let's all take one more step.

00:51.533 --> 00:53.689
We have learned to love ourselves,...

00:54.487 --> 00:57.826
...so I now urge you to speak yourself.

01:01.502 --> 01:03.354
I'd like to ask all of you.

01:05.027 --> 01:05.703
What is your name?

01:07.929 --> 01:10.265
What excites you and makes your heart beat?

01:11.847 --> 01:12.700
Tell me your story.

01:14.224 --> 01:17.882
I want to hear your voice and I want to hear your conviction.

01:19.550 --> 01:21.918
No matter who you are, where you're from...

01:22.682 --> 01:27.457
...your skin color, your gender identity, just speak yourself.

01:29.430 --> 01:32.855
Find your name and find your voice by speaking yourself.

01:35.431 --> 01:39.263
I'm Kim Nam Jun and also RM of BTS.

01:40.703 --> 01:44.831
I'm an idol and I'm an artist from a small town in Korea.

01:46.497 --> 01:51.099
Like most people, I've made many and plenty mistakes in my life.

01:52.935 --> 01:56.386
I have many faults and I have many more fears,...

01:57.185 --> 01:59.890
...but I'm going to embrace myself as hard as I can,...

02:00.885 --> 02:04.542
...and I'm starting to love myself, gradually, just little by little.
