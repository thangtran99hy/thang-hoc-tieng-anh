00:01.089 --> 00:02.327
Why aren't we showing a profit yet?

00:02.429 --> 00:02.971
We're working on it.

00:03.062 --> 00:03.853
It's not good enough.

00:04.372 --> 00:04.921
I want a buyout.

00:05.745 --> 00:07.651
Here is the value of your shares.

00:08.163 --> 00:09.095
Hey, here's an idea.

00:09.247 --> 00:11.323
FedEx offers affordable and fast ground shipping.

00:11.607 --> 00:13.594
That'll be great for business and help us manage our costs.

00:14.227 --> 00:14.867
I want back in.

00:15.142 --> 00:17.105
Well, since you left, our valuation has doubled.

00:21.760 --> 00:22.355
Do you have a quarter?

00:23.279 --> 00:23.591
Nope.

00:24.230 --> 00:25.727
We'll be accepting interns in the fall.
