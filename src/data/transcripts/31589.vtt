00:00.359 --> 00:03.776
A member of the US army steps up to the counter.

00:04.453 --> 00:05.553
Hey, don't deal with this guy.

00:05.647 --> 00:06.185
He's Muslim.

00:07.525 --> 00:09.149
Is he laughing?

00:09.245 --> 00:10.002
Why is that funny?

00:11.269 --> 00:12.473
Hold on, what happened?

00:13.063 --> 00:14.098
This guy is a Muslim.

00:14.647 --> 00:15.641
We live in America.

00:15.739 --> 00:17.948
He can have any religion he wants.

00:18.249 --> 00:19.621
Aren't you fighting against these guys?

00:20.197 --> 00:20.995
Not at the moment.

00:21.925 --> 00:23.330
Right now, I'm ordering a sandwich.

00:24.699 --> 00:25.957
I don't think you should be working here.

00:26.904 --> 00:28.176
Buy your chips and move out.

00:28.999 --> 00:31.271
He doesn't follow orders.

00:31.703 --> 00:33.797
Look, I'd like to order some food, just not from you, okay?

00:34.334 --> 00:34.951
Get out!

00:35.445 --> 00:37.245
Put the chips down and go buy them somewhere else.

00:37.465 --> 00:38.541
You want me to leave this place?

00:38.715 --> 00:39.951
You have a choice to shop anywhere...

00:40.041 --> 00:43.237
...just like he has a choice to practice his religion anywhere.

00:43.445 --> 00:44.989
That's the reason I wear the uniform,...

00:45.205 --> 00:47.259
...so anyone can live free in this country.

00:47.561 --> 00:50.422
Leave the man alone, buy your stuff and leave.

00:51.203 --> 00:53.599
People might say that's very heroic, what you said.

00:53.756 --> 00:54.185
Is it?

00:54.452 --> 00:54.945
No, sir.

00:55.739 --> 00:57.492
No, heroes come in many shapes and sizes.

00:57.582 --> 00:58.519
That wasn't heroic at all.

00:58.936 --> 01:02.736
I was just being a person and standing up for someone else.

01:02.829 --> 01:04.473
But what principles were you defending?

01:04.833 --> 01:06.034
Everyone's unalienable rights.

01:06.443 --> 01:07.134
Everyone's?

01:07.221 --> 01:08.245
Everyone's in this country.

01:08.365 --> 01:09.049
You're Muslim?

01:09.215 --> 01:10.216
It doesn't matter to me, sir.

01:10.443 --> 01:12.012
If you're American, you're an American, period.
