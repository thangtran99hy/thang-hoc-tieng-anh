00:00.152 --> 00:03.915
With the supermarket formula, only enough parts were produced in the first phase...

00:03.983 --> 00:06.451
...to replace what was used in the second, and so on.

00:07.279 --> 00:10.341
This is where the just-in-time system really took shape.

00:12.997 --> 00:16.094
Toyota was able to eliminate much of the waste in Ford's system,...

00:16.293 --> 00:19.124
...making smaller numbers of parts to be used when it needed them,...

00:19.473 --> 00:21.807
...allowing the company to operate on a tighter budget.

00:22.564 --> 00:25.741
Ohno and Toyoda also noticed that American car companies...

00:25.977 --> 00:29.223
...were still employing many of Henry Ford's early production techniques.

00:29.678 --> 00:33.703
They kept operations at full tilt in order to maximize efficiencies of scale...

00:34.043 --> 00:37.421
...but then had to repair defective cars after they rolled off the line.

00:38.167 --> 00:42.791
Ohno believed this caused more problems and didn't encourage workers or machines...

00:43.091 --> 00:44.436
...to stop making the mistake,...

00:44.944 --> 00:47.915
...so he placed a cord above every station which any worker...

00:48.017 --> 00:51.466
...could pull to stop the entire assembly if they spotted a problem.

00:51.995 --> 00:54.527
The whole team would work on it, to prevent it from happening again.

00:54.891 --> 00:59.010
As teams identified more problems, the number of errors began to drop dramatically.
