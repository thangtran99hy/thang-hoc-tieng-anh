ï»¿In Taiwan, handmade drinks have become a well-known culture.

00:04.466 --> 00:08.811
On the street, you will see a lot of handmade drink stores and people.

00:08.975 --> 00:11.159
Old or young all like it very much.

00:11.313 --> 00:14.304
How can we explain this craze of handmade drinks?

00:14.727 --> 00:19.595
In March 2017, the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Taiwan...

00:19.868 --> 00:23.667
...posted an industrial economic statistic report.

00:23.902 --> 00:26.679
The survey said that to cope with customers'...

00:26.752 --> 00:29.651
...changing preferences for handmade drinks,...

00:29.984 --> 00:32.285
...more and more handmade drinks chain stores...

00:32.377 --> 00:34.713
...devoted to creating new products....

00:34.877 --> 00:37.953
...and for the prevailing of the handmade drink culture.

00:38.198 --> 00:41.355
Do you know how many stores are there in Taiwan?

00:41.462 --> 00:48.633
There are 20,121 beverage shops and most of them are handmade drink stores.

00:48.939 --> 00:55.089
The beverage industry made a revenue of 49 billion NT dollars in 2015.

00:55.215 --> 01:01.247
In 2016, it is estimated that the revenue will reach up to 50 billion.

01:01.859 --> 01:05.031
But why are handmade drinks so popular in Taiwan?

01:05.291 --> 01:10.573
First, we may relate this phenomenon to the well-existed culture in Taiwan.

01:10.724 --> 01:13.787
Three hundred years ago, wild tea trees...

01:13.892 --> 01:18.107
...were already cultivated in the mountains of southern Taiwan.

01:18.238 --> 01:22.899
Since then, tea has been famous such as "sun moon lake black tea."

01:23.601 --> 01:27.283
To stay on top of the competitive tea market,...

01:27.443 --> 01:30.494
...some businessmen think up a creative idea...

01:30.628 --> 01:34.777
...and in 1983, the first "bubble tea" was introduced.

01:34.938 --> 01:37.823
Bubble tea is prepared with black tea...

01:37.917 --> 01:40.499
...then the tea is shaken in a "shake cup"...

01:40.617 --> 01:43.547
...to produce bubbles on top of the tea.

01:43.647 --> 01:47.855
With this creativity, tea is no longer the tea itself.

01:48.049 --> 01:50.566
Another development of the bubble tea...

01:50.717 --> 01:53.215
...is the creation of the pearl milk tea,...

01:53.310 --> 01:56.385
...made by adding milk and pearls or tapioca,...

01:56.625 --> 01:59.341
...a traditional Taiwanese dessert, to the tea.

01:59.448 --> 02:01.291
Because of its uniqueness,...

02:01.447 --> 02:05.385
...it is now considered as the name of all handmade drinks.

02:05.958 --> 02:10.308
It also gained its global publicity in the beverage industry.

02:11.121 --> 02:13.539
Now, not just in Taiwan,...

02:13.939 --> 02:18.400
...a handmade drink revolution has begun all over the world.
