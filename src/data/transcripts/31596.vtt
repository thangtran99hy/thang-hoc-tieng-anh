00:01.119 --> 00:03.733
ï»¿In 1959, the Tokaido Shinkansen line...

00:03.842 --> 00:05.983
...started construction under Sogo's leadership.

00:06.428 --> 00:08.615
Shima was appointed the project's chief engineer.

00:09.072 --> 00:12.391
His team designed the sleek and revolutionary cone-shaped front,...

00:12.872 --> 00:14.629
...from which the bullet train got its name.

00:15.256 --> 00:17.371
Rather than being pulled by an engine in front,...

00:17.570 --> 00:18.845
...each carriage of the bullet train...

00:18.923 --> 00:21.131
...was driven by an individual electric motor,...

00:21.450 --> 00:24.668
...which has proven to be safer, faster and more efficient.

00:25.227 --> 00:28.549
Apart from the train itself, the team also built wider tracks,...

00:28.722 --> 00:32.425
...which were more costly but allowed for greater stability and higher speeds.

00:33.174 --> 00:38.095
Three thousand bridges and 67 tunnels were built on the 515-kilometer line...

00:38.363 --> 00:40.675
...to allow a clear and largely curveless path.

00:40.950 --> 00:42.942
Older trains were banned from the new line.

00:43.178 --> 00:44.919
Equipped with advanced technologies,...

00:45.029 --> 00:48.540
...the new trains were able to travel as fast as 210 kilometers per hour,...

00:48.784 --> 00:50.685
...a breakthrough in the passenger rail industry...

00:50.901 --> 00:52.584
...and the world's fastest at the time.

00:52.783 --> 00:57.059
The journey time between Tokyo and Osaka was cut from over six hours to four.
