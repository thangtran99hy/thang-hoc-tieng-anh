Japan's shrinking population...

00:02.011 --> 00:04.195
...is forcing the country to look for new workers.

00:04.719 --> 00:08.578
And Prime Minister Shinzo Abe thinks he's found the answer women.

00:09.729 --> 00:12.957
Abe has outlined goals to create a "Japan in which women shine".

00:13.529 --> 00:15.869
The name given to it: "Womenomics."

00:16.578 --> 00:18.192
Female labor participation rate...

00:18.333 --> 00:23.939
...rose from 46.2 percent in 2012 to 49.8 percent in 2017.

00:24.784 --> 00:27.679
Although Abe frequently touts the success of "Womenomics",...

00:27.961 --> 00:31.713
...a closer look highlights a work culture that systematically excludes women.

00:34.249 --> 00:36.287
An expectation that women should stay at home...

00:36.406 --> 00:40.231
...and be primary caregivers has held them back in workplaces all over the world,...

00:40.765 --> 00:43.662
...but in Japan that view is particularly deep-rooted.

00:45.472 --> 00:47.971
Japan also has the third highest gender pay gap...

00:48.121 --> 00:50.259
...in the more developed OECD countries.

00:51.148 --> 00:54.651
Although companies such as Toyota are appointing female executives,...

00:54.953 --> 00:56.041
...change has been slow.

00:56.485 --> 01:00.015
Only 4% of managerial positions are held by women in Japan...

01:00.383 --> 01:04.055
...compared with 9% in China and 17% in the US.
