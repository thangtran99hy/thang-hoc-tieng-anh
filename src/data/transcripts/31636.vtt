The oldest living person (female) is Misao Okawa, aged 114 years.

00:13.882 --> 00:16.871
There is definitely something rather special about the people...

00:16.957 --> 00:19.426
...who live in the Kansai region of Western Japan.

00:19.869 --> 00:22.665
It's already home to the world's oldest living man,...

00:23.049 --> 00:25.776
...115 year old Jiroemon Kimura,...

00:26.388 --> 00:29.379
...and now it is home to the oldest living woman too.

00:29.927 --> 00:34.324
Misao Okawa was born in the city of Osaka in 1898.

00:34.718 --> 00:39.785
She got married in 1919 and she still has two surviving children...

00:40.086 --> 00:41.706
...who are both in their 90s.

00:42.300 --> 00:44.850
"I'm very happy and feeling good", Mrs. Okawa said,...

00:45.155 --> 00:49.305
...as she received her certificate of longevity from the Guinness World Records.

00:49.863 --> 00:52.941
She said she has never suffered any serious health problems...

00:53.339 --> 00:58.390
...and puts her great age down to "always eating a lot of tasty food."
