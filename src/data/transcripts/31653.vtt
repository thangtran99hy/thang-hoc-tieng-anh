Let's talk about Meghan Markle's etiquette.

00:02.268 --> 00:04.499
She closed her own car door.

00:04.605 --> 00:05.895
What is the big deal about that?

00:05.979 --> 00:09.156
Usually, if you are a member of the royal family or a dignitary,...

00:09.225 --> 00:10.485
...you have a member of the staff...

00:10.591 --> 00:12.868
...to open and close the car door for you.

00:13.279 --> 00:16.459
That's not there to propel airs and graces.

00:16.972 --> 00:19.575
It's there from a security point of view.

00:19.781 --> 00:22.842
What are some other things that Meghan can't do?

00:22.933 --> 00:25.049
Now that Meghan is a member of the Royal Family,...

00:25.288 --> 00:26.721
...there's no more selfies.

00:26.811 --> 00:28.035
There are no more autographs.

00:28.095 --> 00:31.436
She can't vote in any election or any referendum...

00:31.534 --> 00:35.946
...and all public social media has to be deleted.

00:36.065 --> 00:39.997
Now, that said, the royal family from the younger generations...

00:40.112 --> 00:43.951
...are known to have private Facebook and Instagram accounts.

00:44.355 --> 00:48.006
But these handles are not known by we members of the public.
