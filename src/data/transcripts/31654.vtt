Can I still use these headphones with the X?

00:02.815 --> 00:06.605
Yeah, but you'll need an adapter or as most people like to call it, a 'dongle.'

00:07.265 --> 00:07.631
A what?

00:07.939 --> 00:08.515
A dongle.

00:08.691 --> 00:09.287
A dongle?

00:09.398 --> 00:09.973
Yeah, a dongle.

00:10.066 --> 00:11.002
It comes in the box.

00:11.095 --> 00:13.491
But what if I just need to charge at the same time?

00:13.776 --> 00:15.349
Then you'll gonna need another type of dongle.

00:15.439 --> 00:16.566
Like a double dongle?

00:16.673 --> 00:18.647
Yeah, double dongle, I guess.

00:19.535 --> 00:20.768
That sounds explicit.
