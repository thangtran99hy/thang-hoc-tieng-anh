00:00.571 --> 00:02.681
As a couple, we travel around in a van,...

00:02.935 --> 00:06.041
...trying to make the world a better place with books.

00:06.625 --> 00:07.789
I'm Alexa Trembly.

00:08.205 --> 00:09.917
My name is Emory Harkins.

00:10.099 --> 00:15.405
We act as a community's bookstore for a day where they don't have bookstores.

00:15.821 --> 00:18.296
On a typical Saturday, we sell 25 books.

00:21.565 --> 00:25.181
Being together, traveling to a new location every day,...

00:25.602 --> 00:27.083
...we're able to get a different perspective,...

00:27.660 --> 00:30.130
...just understand someone else's situation.

00:30.747 --> 00:32.849
We chose diversity in publishing.

00:33.448 --> 00:35.201
Women are being represented,...

00:35.997 --> 00:38.153
...people with different backgrounds...

00:38.432 --> 00:41.478
...such as being in the army or having mental illness.

00:41.807 --> 00:43.688
We want all those stories represented.

00:44.390 --> 00:46.669
It's fun to see the kids come up to the van.

00:47.105 --> 00:48.625
First, they're excited about the van,...

00:48.797 --> 00:50.287
...then they realize there's books there.

00:50.769 --> 00:53.890
It's important to have kids start reading at such a young age.

00:54.537 --> 00:56.322
It brings opportunities.

00:56.561 --> 00:58.972
Books unlock different worlds.
