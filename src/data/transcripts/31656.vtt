In Surabaya, Indonesia, you can often see people walking to their local bus stop,...

00:05.869 --> 00:08.389
...carrying bags of plastic trash.

00:08.906 --> 00:13.531
That's because at local bus stations, that trash can be exchanged for bus tickets.

00:14.486 --> 00:16.679
We can reduce trash so it doesn't pile up at home...

00:16.751 --> 00:19.637
...because we just can bring it here and make good use of it.

00:20.183 --> 00:21.537
It's a win-win situation.

00:21.873 --> 00:23.435
Here's how the system works.

00:23.558 --> 00:27.835
Ten plastic cups or five plastic bottles are good for a two-hour bus ticket.

00:27.983 --> 00:31.184
It doesn't seem like a lot, but the plastic piles up quickly,...

00:31.363 --> 00:36.329
...and every bit helps because Indonesia, as a whole, has a big plastic problem.

00:38.193 --> 00:42.122
Indonesia is one of the biggest contributors in the world for plastic waste...

00:42.471 --> 00:46.341
...and through this initiative, we hope to raise public awareness on the environment,...

00:46.637 --> 00:49.311
...especially issues that relate to plastic trash.

00:50.025 --> 00:54.959
All this waste is then separated and auctioned off to recycling companies.

00:55.884 --> 01:00.025
The Plastic for Tickets plan is part of an ambitious nationwide initiative...

01:00.099 --> 01:03.083
...called Zero Waste Indonesia 2020.
