I pretty much accepted that we wouldn't summit.

00:03.519 --> 00:04.695
But then when we got to the summit,...

00:04.773 --> 00:06.312
...I don't think there's words to describe it.

00:06.749 --> 00:12.795
It was just this feeling of being so small in something so vast.

00:13.287 --> 00:14.287
Congratulations!

00:14.519 --> 00:18.349
For the last two years, I've basically been a full time wheelchair user.

00:19.531 --> 00:21.195
It started about five years ago.

00:21.333 --> 00:25.525
I was having some balance issues and some chronic pain.

00:25.667 --> 00:28.387
I think like everyone else, I was expecting it to go away.

00:28.513 --> 00:29.565
It wouldn't go away.

00:29.659 --> 00:31.593
And so I tried to start finding answers.

00:31.747 --> 00:35.601
Even to this day, still haven't able to tell me exactly why.

00:36.001 --> 00:40.983
The big moment for me on the hike came when we reached this final summit ridge...

00:41.049 --> 00:42.773
...and we had about a quarter mile of steep,...

00:43.547 --> 00:45.877
...sort of treacherous rock between us and the summit.

00:46.063 --> 00:48.791
...and the wheelchair couldn't go any further.

00:49.281 --> 00:50.633
So we had to abandon the chair.

00:51.069 --> 00:53.098
And one of the team members volunteered...

00:53.194 --> 00:55.953
...to help carry Nerissa to the summit on his back.

00:56.065 --> 00:58.713
And together they summited in that fashion.

00:58.794 --> 01:01.379
It was one of the most amazing things I've seen...

01:01.442 --> 01:03.757
...and the people on the mountain were completely blown away.

01:05.707 --> 01:12.751
It was incredible to feel someone else kind of being your legs through that.

01:13.171 --> 01:18.653
If you can be creative and it's something that you truly want to do,...

01:18.950 --> 01:21.328
...then there's a way to figure it out.
