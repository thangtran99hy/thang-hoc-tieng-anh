ï»¿So what why are we here today, what are we doing?

00:11.596 --> 00:13.375
We're here today on the set of British Vogue...

00:13.625 --> 00:15.674
...to celebrate 10 years of Victoria Beckham.

00:15.835 --> 00:18.879
We've put together looks from the last ten years...

00:18.977 --> 00:20.371
...from the Victoria Beckham brand.

00:20.623 --> 00:23.713
I think it's evolved, it's modern, it's minimal.

00:24.256 --> 00:27.435
Victoria do you want to tell us what we're doing today?

00:27.729 --> 00:32.027
Today we're here at Vogue and we are shooting a cover story...

00:32.136 --> 00:36.689
...celebrating the rich and inspiring history of...

00:37.097 --> 00:41.441
...one of the most enduring style icons of all time,...

00:42.054 --> 00:43.372
...me, Victoria Beckham.

00:45.289 --> 00:49.006
Everything she does is very simple, very pure, very pared down.

00:49.643 --> 00:51.081
She's always moving forward.

00:51.373 --> 00:54.148
She's not one to look back and that's what we love about her at Vogue.

00:55.119 --> 00:59.512
This is where two fashion forces join to make something...

00:59.599 --> 01:02.271
...really quite incredible.

01:02.510 --> 01:06.231
She's an icon of style, Vogue is an icon of publishing...

01:06.469 --> 01:10.705
...this really is where two become one.
