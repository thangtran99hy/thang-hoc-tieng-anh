Hi.

00:02.949 --> 00:03.361
Hello.

00:03.947 --> 00:04.162
Hello.

00:04.899 --> 00:06.056
My name is Layla.

00:07.455 --> 00:09.266
Are you here with your parents or...

00:09.471 --> 00:10.305
I'm with my mom.

00:10.747 --> 00:12.016
Can you show me something?

00:13.019 --> 00:13.665
No.

00:14.204 --> 00:17.336
It's kind of boring having a tea or coffee by yourself...

00:17.646 --> 00:19.149
...you need somebody to talk to.

00:19.513 --> 00:20.844
Why are you wearing a hat?

00:21.579 --> 00:23.726
How much money do you have?

00:24.055 --> 00:25.803
Why is your hair white?

00:26.080 --> 00:27.401
It's bit like of trees in autumn,...

00:27.639 --> 00:30.315
...you can ask a tree why are your leaves brown?

00:30.603 --> 00:32.318
Do you mean in the bank or...

00:32.405 --> 00:33.829
Like where you put your money and stuff.

00:34.447 --> 00:37.499
560 pounds a month, pension.

00:37.684 --> 00:38.079
Wow.

00:38.358 --> 00:39.792
If you do have that what would you do with it?

00:39.863 --> 00:43.297
I would get a dog and get a house and swimming pool.

00:45.704 --> 00:49.763
Where are your friends and where they are right now?

00:50.951 --> 00:54.119
Some of my friends are abroad.

00:54.521 --> 01:02.605
I was born in Jamaica, so a lot of my friends are there, you know.

01:03.275 --> 01:05.168
I'm new in London.

01:05.596 --> 01:08.664
Well I had hundreds and thousands of friends...

01:08.791 --> 01:12.322
...but at the moment I got good enough Facebook friends.

01:12.553 --> 01:14.956
Well maybe I can sit with you and have some coffee.

01:15.181 --> 01:16.073
You like coffee?
