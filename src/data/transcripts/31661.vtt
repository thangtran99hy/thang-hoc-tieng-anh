00:00.311 --> 00:03.911
But are Americanisms trashing British English?

00:05.107 --> 00:11.779
According to Lane, many of these American words are actually British in origin.

00:13.426 --> 00:17.051
We took Lane out to pound the sidewalks of London...

00:17.403 --> 00:20.576
...to see if Londoners knew the origins of their words.

00:21.108 --> 00:23.109
What do you call this that we're walking on right now?

00:23.672 --> 00:23.983
Pavement.

00:24.135 --> 00:26.707
Okay, now I said the word "sidewalk," what would that make you think of?

00:27.600 --> 00:31.105
Sidewalk is an obvious Americanism except that it originated in Britain.

00:31.431 --> 00:35.933
It was being used already in the early 1800s to describe the footpath...

00:36.269 --> 00:38.001
...along the Westminster Bridge.

00:38.661 --> 00:40.707
If I said someone was mad, what would that make you think of?

00:42.553 --> 00:43.382
Probably insane.

00:43.507 --> 00:46.603
Insane but if I said they were angry and that's how they were mad...

00:50.372 --> 00:50.855
Mad.

00:51.679 --> 00:52.705
Yeah that makes me mad.

00:52.953 --> 00:54.341
That's a pure American usage.

00:54.493 --> 00:57.457
"Mad" meaning angry goes all the way back to at least about 1400...

00:57.639 --> 00:59.383
...according to the Oxford English dictionary.
