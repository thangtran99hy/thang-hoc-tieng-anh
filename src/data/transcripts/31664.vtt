00:00.016 --> 00:01.787
My name is Fuka Haruna.

00:02.333 --> 00:04.877
People call me Harukaze-chan online.

00:05.649 --> 00:08.548
I am in the 6th grade and I'm also an actress.

00:11.510 --> 00:13.955
My mom gave me a mobile phone when I was three,...

00:14.227 --> 00:17.103
...so she could reach me while she was at a driving school.

00:17.416 --> 00:18.723
So, I really grew up with it.

00:19.427 --> 00:23.141
I started using Twitter when I was nine to promote one of my works.

00:23.730 --> 00:26.762
It since become a big family of followers.

00:27.339 --> 00:31.417
I received some harsh comments and they do hurt my feelings.

00:31.996 --> 00:37.502
I used to cry alone in my room especially when they wrote bad things about my family.

00:38.146 --> 00:40.769
But, I still love to communicate with my followers,...

00:41.250 --> 00:44.029
...and I hope as long as I reply sincerely,...

00:44.459 --> 00:47.312
I can be friends even with some of my critics.

00:48.461 --> 00:51.339
Meet 27-year-old Taichi Hirano.

00:52.261 --> 00:55.310
By any standard, he's a typical Japanese youth.

00:57.193 --> 01:00.426
By day, he works as a nurse, taking care of seniors.

01:02.059 --> 01:04.673
But by night, he's leading rallying cries...

01:04.765 --> 01:07.177
...against the use of nuclear energy in Japan.

01:07.707 --> 01:12.231
He says it was the accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant in March last year,...

01:12.571 --> 01:15.325
...that woke up his otherwise shy personality.

01:19.965 --> 01:21.771
Even before the 3/11 incident,...

01:22.157 --> 01:25.600
...I vaguely knew that nuclear energy could be dangerous.

01:26.185 --> 01:28.512
But, I was hesitant to attend demonstrations...

01:28.893 --> 01:30.824
...because I didn't know what to expect.

01:31.654 --> 01:35.277
But, when I watched the explosion at the nuclear power plants in Fukushima,...

01:35.796 --> 01:38.028
...and how they've been affecting local communities,...

01:38.414 --> 01:40.769
...I decided I needed to speak up.

01:42.377 --> 01:46.505
Well, tens of thousands of people have been gathering in Kasumigaseki,...

01:46.562 --> 01:49.309
...where many government buildings are every Friday.

01:49.623 --> 01:53.300
As you can see, there are many young people in their 20s and 30s....

01:53.380 --> 01:57.049
...including some children, protesting against the government's decision...

01:57.122 --> 01:59.033
...to restart nuclear reactors.
