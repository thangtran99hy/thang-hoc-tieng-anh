00:00.301 --> 00:06.949
ï»¿The man who brought heroes to life and bad guys to justice,...

00:09.955 --> 00:14.302
...Stan Lee created a comic book universe that was true to its brand name:...

00:14.517 --> 00:15.176
...a marvel.

00:17.102 --> 00:21.153
Born Stanley Martin Lieber in New York City in 1922,...

00:21.551 --> 00:26.045
...Lee entered the comic book world as a teenage assistant in 1939.

00:26.362 --> 00:27.677
An aspiring novelist,...

00:27.871 --> 00:32.188
...Lee helped usher in the Silver Age of comic books in the early 60s,...

00:32.500 --> 00:34.721
...bringing sophistication and mass appeal...

00:35.061 --> 00:38.283
...to a genre once exclusively marketed to children.

00:38.527 --> 00:43.075
I wanted to write about people, not about guys punching each other.

00:45.409 --> 00:46.111
Those people?

00:46.439 --> 00:48.833
Flawed, relatable, lovable characters,...

00:49.097 --> 00:51.368
...Lee's signature breed of superhero.

00:51.886 --> 00:56.420
Remember, with great power comes great responsibility.

00:56.632 --> 00:59.184
It's no fun reading about somebody who's perfect.

00:59.713 --> 01:02.725
You want to read about people that you can identify with...

01:02.843 --> 01:04.235
...because we've all got a problem,...

01:04.533 --> 01:09.597
...and if you can create and write about a character who is flawed,...

01:10.061 --> 01:14.433
...but manages to overcome those flaws, then I think that's pretty good.

01:14.839 --> 01:17.411
In the 70s, Lee relocated to Los Angeles...

01:17.629 --> 01:20.286
...to bring his larger-than-life stories to the big screen,...

01:20.428 --> 01:23.800
...crafting a blockbuster movie and TV franchise that made Lee...

01:23.957 --> 01:27.115
...one of the highest-grossing movie producers of all time.

01:27.355 --> 01:31.089
Lee was a recognizable face too, appearing in discreet cameos...

01:31.167 --> 01:35.057
...his fans eagerly spotted in over 40 movie and television roles.

01:35.478 --> 01:38.661
When he arrived at Comic Cons and red carpets across the country,...

01:38.961 --> 01:40.890
...he was greeted with a hero's welcome.

01:41.075 --> 01:43.285
I still sometimes have trouble believing it...

01:44.016 --> 01:47.233
...because all I was doing was trying to just make a living.

01:47.319 --> 01:51.036
You do these things and then I got to enjoy writing them,...

01:51.547 --> 01:54.085
...so all I was doing was having fun.
