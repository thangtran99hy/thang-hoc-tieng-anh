ï»¿Nearly half of Americans don't brush their teeth enough...

00:07.871 --> 00:10.906
...and when food builds up in those nooks and crannies.

00:11.299 --> 00:14.271
You're inviting a host of bacteria to the party,...

00:14.689 --> 00:16.119
...including your gum line.

00:16.922 --> 00:19.347
Which irritate and inflame your gums...

00:19.605 --> 00:23.582
...causing tenderness and bleeding but that's just the start.

00:24.166 --> 00:27.867
Soon enough that infection will trigger your immune system...

00:28.347 --> 00:31.106
...which sends fighter cells to battle the bacteria.

00:31.917 --> 00:34.965
This creates a hostile environment for the bacteria...

00:35.564 --> 00:36.854
...which is what you want.

00:37.451 --> 00:41.333
But it can also damage the cells in nearby tissue and bone.

00:42.087 --> 00:47.056
Six months to years later, that tissue and bone will eventually die.

00:47.513 --> 00:50.370
At this point, you don't have gingivitis anymore...

00:50.881 --> 00:52.779
...you have something much worse:...

00:53.627 --> 00:55.120
...Periodontal disease.
