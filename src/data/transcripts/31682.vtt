00:00.283 --> 00:03.798
The Sasquatch is a zip line built in 2015 that connects Whistler...

00:03.880 --> 00:06.422
...and Blackcomb mountains in British Columbia, Canada.

00:06.924 --> 00:10.241
This 1.36-mile or 2.2-kilometer zip line...

00:10.561 --> 00:12.395
...will be an experience like no other.

00:12.873 --> 00:15.243
The Sasquatch starts high up on Blackcomb mountain...

00:15.563 --> 00:18.963
...at an elevation of almost 5,000 feet or 1,500 meters...

00:19.284 --> 00:21.633
...and drops steeply along the slope of Blackcomb mountain...

00:21.721 --> 00:23.087
...before leaving the tree line,...

00:23.363 --> 00:26.013
...crossing the valley and coasting to the other side.

00:26.739 --> 00:29.990
Hairpin turns with steep drops go on for ten minutes...

00:30.108 --> 00:32.266
...before you reach the start of the Sasquatch.

00:32.595 --> 00:34.381
After the initial drop of the zip line,...

00:34.649 --> 00:37.231
...it rounds out, launching you between the two mountains.

00:37.519 --> 00:40.440
The moment the line decreases its slope and the tree line ends,...

00:40.733 --> 00:44.257
...you'll be hit with a massive gust of wind, spinning you wildly.

00:44.537 --> 00:46.681
As you coast downward towards Whistler mountain,...

00:46.933 --> 00:50.395
...speeds will continue to increase until about the halfway point.

00:50.654 --> 00:56.755
Top speeds of 87 to 93 miles per hour or 140 to 150 kilometers per hour...

00:56.857 --> 00:58.018
...have been recorded.

00:58.188 --> 01:00.520
Depending on your speed, the Sasquatch will last...

01:00.600 --> 01:03.068
...around a minute and a half of constant zipping.

01:03.428 --> 01:06.295
This is as close as it gets to the feeling of flying like a bird...

01:06.596 --> 01:08.101
...while still connected to the ground.
