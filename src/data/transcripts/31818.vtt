00:00.677 --> 00:01.374
ï»¿Okay, get ready.

00:01.451 --> 00:02.684
Here is the question.

00:04.669 --> 00:08.659
What is the most important lesson you've learned in your life...

00:08.959 --> 00:12.779
..and how would you apply it to your time as Miss Universe?

00:14.512 --> 00:17.115
I work a lot in the slums of Tondo, Manila,...

00:17.193 --> 00:21.089
...and the life there is very, it's poor and it's very sad,...

00:21.153 --> 00:24.635
...and I've always taught myself to look for the beauty in it,...

00:24.721 --> 00:28.355
...to look in the beauty in the faces of the children, and to be grateful,...

00:28.478 --> 00:31.210
...and I would bring this aspect as a Miss Universe...

00:31.277 --> 00:34.687
...to see situations with a silver lining and to assess...

00:34.956 --> 00:36.531
...where I could give something,...

00:36.615 --> 00:40.309
...where I could provide something as a spokesperson,...

00:40.520 --> 00:44.205
...and this, I think, if I could teach also people to be grateful,...

00:44.400 --> 00:48.185
...we could have an amazing world where negativity could not grow and foster,...

00:48.264 --> 00:50.848
...and children would have a smile on their face.

00:51.085 --> 00:51.551
Thank you.

00:55.202 --> 00:56.994
Thank you, Philippines.
