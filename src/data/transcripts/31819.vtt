ï»¿It was cold here in Hollywood today.

00:01.509 --> 00:03.495
We're having what they call a cold snap.

00:03.579 --> 00:05.747
It's so cold, I had to wear two tank tops to work today.

00:06.785 --> 00:09.918
The high today was 55 degrees.

00:10.009 --> 00:10.806
Can you imagine?

00:10.970 --> 00:12.007
And everyone is freaking out.

00:12.091 --> 00:13.867
Last night, the local news here in LA,...

00:14.348 --> 00:16.276
...the local news in LA is hilarious.

00:16.370 --> 00:20.585
We really have no idea how silly we would look if people in places like Milwaukee...

00:20.657 --> 00:23.605
...saw how we react when the temperature drops below 55.

00:23.713 --> 00:25.069
For the past 24 hours,...

00:25.327 --> 00:28.325
...this is the sort of thing they've been saying on our local weather reports.

00:28.472 --> 00:31.190
Are you ready for probably two of the coldest nights...

00:31.289 --> 00:33.288
...you've ever experienced in Southern California?

00:33.414 --> 00:36.186
And look at the temperatures: only into the 50s.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.629
Cold, cold, cold coming our way.

00:38.773 --> 00:39.833
Beyond cold.
