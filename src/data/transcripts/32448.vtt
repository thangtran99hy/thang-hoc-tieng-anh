00:00.369 --> 00:05.898
There have been nearly 5,000 fires in California since the start of 2018.

00:06.675 --> 00:09.426
The fire season has been dominating the news.

00:09.633 --> 00:12.896
This has turned into another record-setting fire season.

00:12.977 --> 00:15.190
Now the largest in state history.

00:15.274 --> 00:16.821
Really there's no end in sight.

00:16.931 --> 00:17.591
It's hot.

00:17.803 --> 00:18.635
It's dry.

00:18.836 --> 00:19.495
It's windy.

00:19.790 --> 00:22.226
Just about everything on the ground is flammable,...

00:22.453 --> 00:27.715
...but there is one thing that's consistently making wildfires in California worse...

00:27.908 --> 00:29.533
...and worse and worse.

00:30.405 --> 00:30.857
Us.

00:33.290 --> 00:37.555
At this point, even calling them wildfires might be a misnomer...

00:37.704 --> 00:39.992
...because most of them are not natural.

00:40.315 --> 00:44.237
Humans are responsible for starting a whopping 84 percent of them.

00:44.541 --> 00:47.402
The Northern California Carr fire, for example,...

00:47.521 --> 00:50.219
...was started by sparks from a car tire's rim.

00:50.492 --> 00:52.591
And in Southern California,...

00:52.692 --> 00:57.037
...the Holy Fire just outside of LA started after a suspected arson.

00:57.414 --> 01:00.817
These are just two of the fires currently active in the state.

01:01.256 --> 01:07.345
So far, in 2018, 629,000 acres have burned.

01:08.215 --> 01:13.113
That's nearly three times as much compared to the same time period in 2017.
