00:00.144 --> 00:02.795
These are tax brackets for 2019,...

00:03.352 --> 00:04.276
Simple, right?

00:05.205 --> 00:08.729
...but many of us make a common mistake when looking at this.

00:09.253 --> 00:12.447
Let's say my income is 84,000 dollars.

00:13.645 --> 00:15.575
You might think that puts me in the third bracket,...

00:15.864 --> 00:19.395
...so I would owe the federal government 22% of my income.

00:22.049 --> 00:23.169
This is wrong,...

00:23.576 --> 00:27.505
...and it's causing us to have uninformed debates about tax policy.

00:31.576 --> 00:32.899
Here's how it actually works.

00:33.765 --> 00:36.405
Let's go back to my 84,000-dollar income.

00:37.219 --> 00:39.624
Now, instead of thinking of tax rates as brackets,...

00:40.334 --> 00:42.024
...we should think of them as pockets,...

00:42.659 --> 00:45.221
...but first, there's one special pocket we need to talk about.

00:46.057 --> 00:48.775
The money we put in this pocket is not taxed.

00:49.144 --> 00:51.164
The government automatically lets single people...

00:51.254 --> 00:55.224
...put 12,000 dollars in this special pocket and more for couples,...

00:55.705 --> 00:57.450
...but if you spend a lot of money on things...

00:57.549 --> 01:00.388
...like medical expenses or charitable donations,...

01:00.693 --> 01:02.155
...you can sometimes put in more.

01:02.575 --> 01:03.795
These are called deductions.

01:05.068 --> 01:07.012
With the 70,000 dollars that's left over,...

01:07.429 --> 01:09.047
...we can start filling up the pockets.

01:11.031 --> 01:17.613
The first pocket only has room for 9,700 dollars, so I only pay 10% on this money.

01:20.766 --> 01:24.041
Then I pay 12% on the money in the next pocket...

01:29.814 --> 01:32.809
...and then 22% on the money in this pocket.

01:35.864 --> 01:37.778
These are called marginal tax rates.

01:38.189 --> 01:39.906
...and that's how these brackets actually work.
