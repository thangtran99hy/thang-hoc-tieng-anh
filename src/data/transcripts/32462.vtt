In the small town of Sulphur, Oklahoma, one of the most popular hangouts...

00:05.575 --> 00:09.407
...is a lemonade stand run by six-year-old A'layah Robinson.

00:09.700 --> 00:10.680
I'm in charge!

00:10.999 --> 00:11.992
Whose idea was this?

00:12.095 --> 00:12.597
Mine.

00:12.848 --> 00:15.345
A'layah even has a business card.

00:15.667 --> 00:17.442
Aren't you a little young to have your own business?

00:17.598 --> 00:18.190
No.

00:18.389 --> 00:21.023
But Lemonade for Love is not for profit.

00:21.374 --> 00:24.445
A'layah is on a mission to help children who suffer...

00:24.876 --> 00:26.954
...just like she and her brothers did.

00:27.373 --> 00:31.643
They were tossed from home to home to home to home for neglect or abuse and...

00:31.951 --> 00:33.645
...this happened in the foster care system.

00:33.841 --> 00:36.091
When Misty Robinson adopted the siblings,...

00:36.161 --> 00:39.000
...A'layah's younger brother didn't own a single toy.

00:39.468 --> 00:42.993
Heartbroken, A'layah, then 4, came up with a goal.

00:43.387 --> 00:47.022
In her mind, she wants to provide every single foster child with a toy.

00:47.467 --> 00:47.939
In the world?

00:48.178 --> 00:48.623
In the world.

00:48.883 --> 00:50.634
They started with Oklahoma.

00:51.043 --> 00:53.202
Please come see me and buy some lemonade.

00:53.461 --> 00:59.541
She made 136 dollars with her lemonade stand, and so we just went from there.

00:59.626 --> 01:00.834
It just kept getting bigger and bigger.

01:01.145 --> 01:03.545
The Robinson family recruited volunteers,...

01:03.647 --> 01:05.470
...shared their story on social media...

01:05.595 --> 01:07.955
...and have since raised enough money to pack gift bags...

01:08.037 --> 01:10.433
...for more than a thousand foster care children.

01:10.747 --> 01:13.884
A'layah the foster child, now a local celebrity,...

01:14.220 --> 01:16.435
...turning lemons into love.

01:16.953 --> 01:20.132
