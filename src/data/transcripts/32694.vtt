00:02.769 --> 00:03.710
I know Death.

00:07.423 --> 00:08.755
He's got many faces.

00:12.825 --> 00:14.525
I look forward to seeing this one.

00:18.801 --> 00:21.163
Everything you did brought you where you are now,...

00:24.774 --> 00:25.764
...where you belong:...

00:29.257 --> 00:29.935
...home.

00:39.912 --> 00:40.572
They're coming.

00:43.039 --> 00:44.656
Our enemy doesn't tire,...

00:47.171 --> 00:48.250
...doesn't stop,...

00:49.739 --> 00:50.578
...doesn't feel.

01:04.518 --> 01:06.335
I promise to fight for the living.

01:08.874 --> 01:10.435
I intend to keep that promise.
