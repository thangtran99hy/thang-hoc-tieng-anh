I would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.

00:19.403 --> 00:22.933
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.

00:24.233 --> 00:27.411
Vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds.

00:28.093 --> 00:32.341
When you see a vulture like this, the first thing that comes to your mind is,...

00:32.683 --> 00:37.822
...these are disgusting, ugly, greedy creatures that are just after your flesh,...

00:38.269 --> 00:40.057
...associated with politicians.

00:45.194 --> 00:46.907
I want to change that perception.

00:47.367 --> 00:50.513
I want to change those feelings you have for these birds...

00:50.603 --> 00:51.975
...because they need our sympathy.

00:52.538 --> 00:53.241
They really do...

00:53.775 --> 00:54.671
...and I'll tell you why.

00:55.547 --> 00:58.445
First of all, why do they have such a bad press?

00:59.518 --> 01:03.719
When Charles Darwin went across the Atlantic in 1832 on the Beagle,...

01:04.453 --> 01:07.248
...he saw the turkey vulture, and he said,...

01:07.529 --> 01:10.926
..."These are disgusting birds with bald scarlet heads...

01:11.623 --> 01:13.462
...that are formed to revel in putridity."

01:15.242 --> 01:18.285
You could not get a worse insult, and that from Charles Darwin.

01:19.847 --> 01:23.258
You know, he changed his mind when he came back, and I'll tell you why.

01:23.813 --> 01:26.315
They've also been associated with Disney,...

01:27.089 --> 01:30.853
...personified as goofy, dumb, stupid characters.

01:32.457 --> 01:34.933
More recently, if you've been following the Kenyan press,...

01:42.724 --> 01:47.342
...these are the attributes that they associated the Kenyan MPs with,...

01:47.915 --> 01:49.078
...but I want to challenge that.

01:49.528 --> 01:50.339
I want to challenge that.

01:50.437 --> 01:51.015
Do you know why?

01:52.050 --> 01:56.523
Because MPs do not keep the environment clean.

01:59.421 --> 02:02.594
MPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases.

02:04.470 --> 02:05.645
They are hardly monogamous.

02:11.102 --> 02:12.372
They are far from being extinct.

02:14.413 --> 02:17.236
And my favorite is, vultures are better-looking.

02:21.338 --> 02:25.164
So, there are two types of vultures in this planet.

02:25.423 --> 02:28.141
There are the New World vultures that are mainly found in the Americas...

02:28.301 --> 02:29.953
...like the condors and the caracaras,...

02:30.584 --> 02:33.661
...and then the Old World vultures, where we have 16 species.

02:33.873 --> 02:38.393
From these 16, 11 of them are facing a high risk of extinction.

02:39.985 --> 02:41.358
So, why are vultures important?

02:42.335 --> 02:45.226
First of all, they provide vital ecological services.

02:45.637 --> 02:46.235
They clean up.

02:46.401 --> 02:48.224
They're our natural garbage collectors.

02:48.503 --> 02:50.793
They clean up carcasses right to the bone.

02:51.348 --> 02:53.847
They help to kill all the bacteria.

02:54.017 --> 02:56.677
They help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread...

02:56.911 --> 02:58.747
...and cause huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals.
