00:14.013 --> 00:18.023
Back in New York, I am the head of development for a non-profit called Robin Hood.

00:18.317 --> 00:19.537
When I'm not fighting poverty,...

00:19.677 --> 00:23.325
...I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company.

00:23.943 --> 00:27.860
Now, in our town, where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff,...

00:28.482 --> 00:31.941
...you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action.

00:32.887 --> 00:34.483
I remember my first fire.

00:34.751 --> 00:36.351
I was the second volunteer on the scene,...

00:36.483 --> 00:39.002
...so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in,...

00:39.883 --> 00:42.666
...but still, it was a real footrace against the other volunteers...

00:42.738 --> 00:45.401
...to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be.

00:46.296 --> 00:47.499
When I found the captain,...

00:47.633 --> 00:51.237
...he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner,...

00:51.530 --> 00:54.816
...who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.

00:55.633 --> 00:57.157
Here it was, the middle of the night,...

00:57.724 --> 00:59.675
...she was standing outside in the pouring rain,...

01:00.522 --> 01:05.209
...under an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot, while her house was in flames.

01:06.515 --> 01:08.752
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me,...

01:08.895 --> 01:15.367
...let's call him Lex Luthor, got to the captain first...

01:15.676 --> 01:20.395
...and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog.

01:21.410 --> 01:22.119
The dog!

01:23.365 --> 01:24.822
I was stunned with jealousy.

01:25.215 --> 01:28.545
Here was some lawyer or money manager who, for the rest of his life,...

01:28.659 --> 01:30.917
...gets to tell people that he went into a burning building...

01:31.322 --> 01:35.386
...to save a living creature just because he beat me by five seconds.

01:35.558 --> 01:37.497
Well, I was next.

01:38.228 --> 01:39.417
The captain waved me over.

01:39.963 --> 01:42.435
He said, "Bezos, I need you to go into the house.

01:42.719 --> 01:45.204
I need you to go upstairs, past the fire,...

01:45.417 --> 01:48.105
...and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes."

01:51.508 --> 01:52.123
I swear.

01:53.466 --> 01:57.059
So, not exactly what I was hoping for, but off I went.

01:58.719 --> 02:01.432
Up the stairs, down the hall, past the 'real' firefighters,...

02:01.499 --> 02:03.626
...who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point,...

02:04.411 --> 02:07.459
...into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes.

02:07.542 --> 02:12.323
Now, I know what you're thinking, but I'm no hero.

02:17.823 --> 02:22.047
I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis...

02:22.125 --> 02:23.832
...and the precious dog by the front door.

02:25.233 --> 02:27.763
We took our treasures outside to the homeowner,...

02:27.853 --> 02:32.593
...where, not surprisingly, his received much more attention than did mine.

02:33.612 --> 02:36.766
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the homeowner,...

02:36.885 --> 02:39.544
...thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home.

02:40.505 --> 02:43.223
The act of kindness she noted above all others:...

02:44.702 --> 02:46.434
...someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes.

02:48.233 --> 02:50.381
You know, in both my vocation at Robin Hood...

02:50.443 --> 02:52.567
...and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter,...

02:52.931 --> 02:57.203
...I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale.
