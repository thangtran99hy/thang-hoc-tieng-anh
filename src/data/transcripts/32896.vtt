It's often said that you can tell a lot about a person by looking at what's on their bookshelves.

00:19.635 --> 00:21.401
What do my bookshelves say about me?

00:22.361 --> 00:28.075
Well, when I asked myself this question a few years ago, I made an alarming discovery.

00:29.087 --> 00:33.987
I'd always thought of myself as a fairly cultured, cosmopolitan sort of person,...

00:34.593 --> 00:37.307
...but my bookshelves told a rather different story.

00:38.450 --> 00:42.465
Pretty much all the titles on them were by British or North American authors,...

00:42.948 --> 00:45.108
...and there was almost nothing in translation.

00:46.321 --> 00:51.423
Discovering this massive, cultural blind spot in my reading came as quite a shock,...

00:51.976 --> 00:54.955
...and when I thought about it, it seemed like a real shame.

00:55.559 --> 00:58.843
I knew there had to be lots of amazing stories out there...

00:58.925 --> 01:01.699
...by writers working in languages other than English,...

01:02.250 --> 01:05.460
...and it seemed really sad to think that my reading habits...

01:05.527 --> 01:07.525
...meant I would probably never encounter them.

01:08.391 --> 01:13.750
So, I decided to prescribe myself an intensive course of global reading.

01:14.573 --> 01:20.163
2012 was set to be a very international year for the UK; it was the year of the London Olympics,...

01:20.451 --> 01:25.490
...and so I decided to use it as my time frame to try and read a novel,...

01:25.895 --> 01:31.364
...short story collection or memoir from every country in the world.

01:32.798 --> 01:33.641
And so I did,...

01:34.133 --> 01:37.579
...and it was very exciting and I learned some remarkable things...

01:37.673 --> 01:41.297
...and made some wonderful connections that I want to share with you today,...

01:42.071 --> 01:44.939
...but it started with some practical problems.

01:45.859 --> 01:50.427
Now, after I'd worked out which of the many different lists of countries in the world...

01:50.535 --> 01:51.967
...to use for my project,...

01:52.757 --> 01:57.015
...I ended up going with the list of UN-recognized nations, to which I added Taiwan,...

01:57.113 --> 02:00.341
...which gave me a total of 196 countries,...

02:01.123 --> 02:04.175
...and after I'd worked out how to fit reading and blogging about...

02:04.271 --> 02:08.519
...roughly four books a week around working five days a week,...

02:09.509 --> 02:11.826
...I then had to face up to the fact that...

02:12.039 --> 02:15.515
...I might not even be able to get books in English from every country.

02:16.540 --> 02:22.493
Only around 4.5 percent of the literary works published each year in the UK are translations,...

02:22.984 --> 02:26.143
...and the figures are similar for much of the English-speaking world...

02:26.589 --> 02:29.203
...although the proportion of translated books...

02:29.360 --> 02:31.865
...published in many other countries is a lot higher.

02:33.128 --> 02:35.911
4.5 percent is tiny enough to start with,...

02:36.425 --> 02:40.940
...but what that figure doesn't tell you is that many of those books will come from countries...

02:41.039 --> 02:44.582
...with strong publishing networks and lots of industry professionals...

02:44.694 --> 02:48.935
...primed to go out and sell those titles to English-language publishers.

02:49.661 --> 02:53.782
So, for example, although well over 100 books are translated from French...

02:53.868 --> 02:55.750
...and published in the UK each year,...

02:56.215 --> 03:00.305
...most of them will come from countries like France or Switzerland.

03:01.067 --> 03:05.226
French-speaking Africa, on the other hand, will rarely ever get a look-in.
