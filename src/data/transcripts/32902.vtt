Recently, I flew over a crowd of thousands of people in Brazil playing music by George Frideric Handel.

00:25.812 --> 00:31.508
I also drove along the streets of Amsterdam, again, playing music by this same composer.

00:31.979 --> 00:32.948
Let's take a look.

00:53.791 --> 00:55.721
I live there on the third floor.

01:40.433 --> 01:44.781
All this was a real magical experience for hundreds of reasons.

01:45.586 --> 01:48.139
Now, you may ask, why have I done these things?

01:48.285 --> 01:51.834
They're not really typical for a musician's day-to-day life.

01:52.975 --> 01:55.986
Well, I did it because I fell in love with the music...

01:56.543 --> 02:00.646
...and I wanted to share it with as many people as possible.

02:01.820 --> 02:03.627
It started a couple of years ago.

02:03.840 --> 02:09.306
I was sitting at home on the couch with the flu and browsing the Internet a little...

02:09.597 --> 02:13.305
...when I found out that Handel had written works for the keyboard.

02:14.099 --> 02:15.092
Well, I was surprised.

02:15.155 --> 02:16.381
I did not know this.

02:16.664 --> 02:20.077
So, I downloaded the sheet music and started playing...

02:21.051 --> 02:28.474
...and what happened next was that I entered this state of pure, unprejudiced amazement.

02:29.287 --> 02:34.379
It was an experience of being totally in awe of the music,...

02:34.951 --> 02:37.681
...and I had not felt that in a long time.

02:38.565 --> 02:41.570
It might be easier to relate to this when you hear it.

02:42.857 --> 02:47.235
The first piece that I played through started like this.
