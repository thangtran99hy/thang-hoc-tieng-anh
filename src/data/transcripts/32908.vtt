00:01.400 --> 00:02.040
Where are we?

00:02.121 --> 00:04.235
Paris, 2010 A.D.,...

00:04.299 --> 00:07.457
...and this is the mighty Musee D'Orsay,...

00:07.531 --> 00:09.685
...home to many of the greatest paintings in history.

00:09.799 --> 00:10.783
Oh, that's wonderful.

00:12.963 --> 00:13.387
Ignore that.

00:13.452 --> 00:14.967
I've got something more important to show you.

00:15.968 --> 00:19.614
I just wondered, between you and me, in 100 words,...

00:21.068 --> 00:24.176
...where do you think Van Gogh rates in the history of art?

00:24.577 --> 00:28.613
Well, big question,...

00:29.012 --> 00:32.886
...but to me, Van Gogh is the finest painter of them all,...

00:34.179 --> 00:37.739
...certainly the most popular, great painter of all time,...

00:38.427 --> 00:39.689
...the most beloved.

00:39.943 --> 00:42.832
His command of color, the most magnificent.

00:43.620 --> 00:49.297
He transformed the pain of his tormented life into ecstatic beauty.

00:50.221 --> 00:53.884
Pain is easy to portray, but to use your passion and pain...

00:53.951 --> 00:58.410
...to portray the ecstasy and joy and magnificence of our world,...

00:59.245 --> 01:00.713
...no one had ever done it before.

01:01.885 --> 01:03.886
Perhaps no one ever will again.

01:04.629 --> 01:10.097
To my mind, that strange, wild man who roamed the fields of Provence...

01:10.172 --> 01:13.342
...was not only the world's greatest artist...

01:13.497 --> 01:18.122
...but also one of the greatest men who ever lived.

01:20.408 --> 01:22.325
Vincent, I'm sorry.

01:23.232 --> 01:24.613
I'm sorry, is it too much?

01:26.531 --> 01:28.927
No, they are tears of joy.

01:32.855 --> 01:33.568
Thank you, sir.

01:35.199 --> 01:35.820
Thank you.

01:36.023 --> 01:37.486
You're welcome.

01:38.337 --> 01:39.000
You're welcome.

01:39.111 --> 01:40.330
Sorry about the beard.
