Hello.

00:16.626 --> 00:21.966
My name is Jarrett Krosoczka, and I write and illustrate books for children for a living.

00:22.861 --> 00:25.887
So, I use my imagination as my full-time job,...

00:26.921 --> 00:31.876
...but well before my imagination was my vocation, my imagination saved my life.

00:33.274 --> 00:39.211
When I was a kid, I loved to draw, and the most talented artist I knew was my mother,...

00:40.229 --> 00:41.946
...but my mother was addicted to heroin,...

00:43.634 --> 00:46.611
...and when your parent is a drug addict,...

00:47.210 --> 00:49.567
...it's kind of like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football.

00:50.285 --> 00:52.498
Because as much as you want to love on that person,...

00:52.591 --> 00:54.536
...as much as you want to receive love from that person,...

00:55.202 --> 00:57.385
...every time you open your heart, you end up on your back.

00:58.415 --> 01:03.412
So, throughout my childhood, my mother was incarcerated and I didn't have my father...

01:03.518 --> 01:06.767
...because I didn't even learn his first name until I was in the sixth grade,...

01:08.091 --> 01:11.534
...but I had my grandparents, my maternal grandparents Joseph and Shirley,...

01:12.565 --> 01:16.606
...who adopted me just before my third birthday and took me in as their own...

01:16.989 --> 01:18.836
...after they had already raised five children.

01:19.407 --> 01:22.041
So, two people who grew up in the Great Depression,...

01:22.947 --> 01:26.606
...there in the very, very early '80s, took on a new kid.

01:27.322 --> 01:30.661
I was the Cousin Oliver of the sitcom of the Krosoczka family,...

01:31.365 --> 01:33.287
...the new kid who came out of nowhere,...

01:34.352 --> 01:38.190
...and I would like to say that life was totally easy with them.

01:39.080 --> 01:43.285
They each smoked two packs a day, each, non-filtered, and by the time I was six,...

01:43.544 --> 01:47.592
...I could order a Southern Comfort Manhattan, dry with a twist, rocks on the side,...

01:47.932 --> 01:50.238
...the ice on the side so you could fit more liquor in the drink.

01:51.631 --> 01:52.789
But they loved the hell out of me.

01:53.309 --> 01:54.439
They loved me so much,...

01:55.014 --> 01:59.417
...and they supported my creative efforts because my grandfather was a self-made man.

02:00.170 --> 02:01.447
He ran and worked in a factory.

02:01.833 --> 02:03.327
My grandmother was a homemaker.

02:04.476 --> 02:10.026
But here was this kid who loved Transformers and Snoopy and the Ninja Turtles,...

02:11.351 --> 02:17.385
...and the characters that I read about, I fell in love with, and they became my friends.

02:18.572 --> 02:22.312
So, my best friends in life were the characters I read about in books.

02:23.979 --> 02:26.432
I went to Gates Lane Elementary School in Worcester, Massachusetts,...

02:26.499 --> 02:31.610
...and I had some wonderful teachers there, most notably in first grade, Mrs. Alisch,...

02:32.686 --> 02:37.958
...and I just, I can just remember the love that she offered us as her students.

02:38.983 --> 02:43.896
When I was in the third grade, a monumental event happened.

02:44.001 --> 02:45.804
An author visited our school, Jack Gantos.

02:45.869 --> 02:51.164
A published author of books came to talk to us about what he did for a living.

02:52.159 --> 02:55.294
And afterwards, we all went back to our classrooms...

02:55.429 --> 02:58.793
...and we drew our own renditions of his main character, Rotten Ralph.
