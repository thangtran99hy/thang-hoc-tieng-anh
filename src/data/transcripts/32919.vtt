By the end of the century,...

00:01.446 --> 00:05.707
...almost half the young people in the world will be in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:06.185 --> 00:13.146
From 2020 to 2100, the rest of the world goes from 506 million kids under five...

00:13.920 --> 00:16.521
...down to 357 million.

00:16.857 --> 00:18.577
So, that is quite a decline,...

00:18.774 --> 00:23.034
...whereas sub-Saharan Africa starts at 173 million...

00:23.285 --> 00:26.163
...and climbs to 293 million.

00:27.333 --> 00:32.079
In North America, the median age is now 35 and going up.

00:32.531 --> 00:35.729
Today, in Africa, the median age is 18.

00:36.219 --> 00:39.334
These young people can be a huge asset.

00:39.677 --> 00:43.188
If they're healthy and educated, they drive economic growth.

00:43.315 --> 00:44.534
They drive innovation,...

00:44.827 --> 00:50.227
...so it's a challenge to the world to take advantage of investing in youth.

00:50.500 --> 00:53.473
Improving their health and education really pays off.
