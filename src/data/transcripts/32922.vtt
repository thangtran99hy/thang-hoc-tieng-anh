Wouldn't it be great if everybody could be an artist?

00:03.757 --> 00:07.489
If we could take our ideas and turn them into compelling images?

00:08.349 --> 00:12.139
This technology allows us to create a smart paintbrush...

00:12.285 --> 00:15.049
...so that if you wanted to create a new picture,...

00:15.247 --> 00:18.479
...you can just draw the shapes of the objects that you want...

00:18.770 --> 00:21.630
...and the neural network can then fill in all the details.

00:25.289 --> 00:29.337
If we add a water feature, the network is able to add reflections,...

00:29.484 --> 00:31.556
...not because we told it that, but because it learned it.

00:32.855 --> 00:35.840
Or if we change the ground to be covered with snow,...

00:35.922 --> 00:39.347
...then it knows that the sky also needs to be a different color.

00:41.055 --> 00:45.898
I really think this technology is gonna be great for architects, designers,...

00:46.015 --> 00:50.207
...people making virtual worlds to train robots and self-driving cars.

00:51.812 --> 00:55.349
The real advance here is that we're able to synthesize images...

00:55.434 --> 00:59.656
...with a lot more diversity and more fidelity than we are able to in the past.

01:00.005 --> 01:04.505
I really think this technology is gonna be great for the dreamers of the world.
