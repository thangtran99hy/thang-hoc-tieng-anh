We didn't dream up a new way to find the best ramen.

00:04.121 --> 00:06.680
We never thought, "You know what Mars needs?"

00:07.461 --> 00:08.351
"A dune buggy."

00:08.879 --> 00:11.851
We didn't decide you should be able to share your home with travelers...

00:11.922 --> 00:12.800
...from around the world.

00:13.119 --> 00:14.991
We're not the ones who imagine one day,...

00:15.139 --> 00:18.652
...we'd all be streaming movies or whatever she's about to do.

00:19.221 --> 00:21.179
But when asked if these ideas were possible,...

00:21.339 --> 00:23.497
...we're the only cloud with the capabilities,...

00:23.577 --> 00:25.973
...experience and know-how to make them happen.

00:26.164 --> 00:27.859
AWS is how.
