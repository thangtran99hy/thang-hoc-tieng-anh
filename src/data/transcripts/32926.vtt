What do you think of when I say the word "design"?

00:17.001 --> 00:22.011
You probably think of things like this: finely crafted objects that you can hold in your hand,...

00:22.334 --> 00:26.990
...or maybe logos and posters and maps that visually explain things,...

00:27.314 --> 00:29.621
...classic icons of timeless design,...

00:30.357 --> 00:32.686
...but I'm not here to talk about that kind of design.

00:33.198 --> 00:37.897
I want to talk about the kind that you probably use every day and may not give much thought to,...

00:38.695 --> 00:42.070
...designs that change all the time and that live inside your pocket.

00:42.913 --> 00:49.379
I'm talking about the design of digital experiences and specifically the design of systems...

00:49.482 --> 00:52.569
...that are so big that their scale can be hard to comprehend.

00:53.536 --> 00:58.737
Consider the fact that Google processes over one billion search queries every day,...

00:59.209 --> 01:03.320
...that every minute, over 100 hours of footage are uploaded to YouTube.

01:03.660 --> 01:10.751
That's more in a single day than all three major US networks broadcast in the last five years combined,...

01:11.349 --> 01:17.643
...and Facebook transmitting the photos, messages and stories of over 1.23 billion people,...

01:18.111 --> 01:22.125
...that's almost half of the Internet population and a sixth of humanity.

01:23.435 --> 01:27.005
These are some of the products that I've helped design over the course of my career,...

01:27.300 --> 01:32.466
...and their scale is so massive that they've produced unprecedented design challenges,...

01:33.629 --> 01:37.677
...but what is really hard about designing at scale is this:...

01:38.217 --> 01:45.066
...It's hard in part because it requires a combination of two things: audacity and humility;...

01:45.788 --> 01:49.264
...audacity to believe that the thing that you're making...

01:49.549 --> 01:52.222
...is something that the entire world wants and needs,...

01:52.725 --> 01:55.621
...and humility to understand that as a designer,...

01:55.951 --> 02:00.647
...it's not about you or your portfolio; it's about the people that you're designing for,...

02:00.949 --> 02:03.759
...and how your work just might help them live better lives.

02:04.645 --> 02:10.315
Now, unfortunately, there's no school that offers the course Designing for Humanity 101.

02:11.393 --> 02:14.292
I and the other designers who work on these kinds of products...

02:14.518 --> 02:17.327
...have had to kind of invent it as we go along,...

02:17.707 --> 02:22.673
...and we are teaching ourselves the emerging best practices of designing at scale,...

02:23.366 --> 02:26.742
...and today, I'd like to share some of the things that we've learned over the years.

02:27.237 --> 02:29.624
Now, the first thing that you need to know about designing at scale...

02:29.683 --> 02:32.012
...is that the little things really matter.

02:32.316 --> 02:37.481
Here's a really good example of how a very tiny design element can make a big impact.

02:38.047 --> 02:42.865
Now, the team at Facebook that manages the Facebook "Like" button...

02:43.462 --> 02:45.793
...decided that it needed to be redesigned.

02:45.905 --> 02:49.721
The button had kind of gotten out of sync with the evolution of our brand...

02:49.785 --> 02:51.147
...and it needed to be modernized.

02:51.599 --> 02:53.449
Now, you might think, well, it's a tiny little button,...

02:53.543 --> 02:57.757
...it probably is a pretty straightforward, easy design assignment, but it wasn't.

02:58.257 --> 03:01.648
Turns out, there were all kinds of constraints for the design of this button.
