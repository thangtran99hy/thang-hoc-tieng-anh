00:16.338 --> 00:21.517
Five years ago, I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland.

00:22.111 --> 00:24.526
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher,...

00:24.818 --> 00:27.748
...to teach a communications class for engineering students.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.233
And I was scared,...

00:31.164 --> 00:31.958
...really scared,...

00:32.061 --> 00:37.857
...scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big, unfamiliar words.

00:38.321 --> 00:40.835
But as these conversations unfolded,...

00:41.493 --> 00:45.104
...I experienced what Alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole...

00:45.493 --> 00:47.845
...and saw that door to a whole new world.

00:48.535 --> 00:51.438
That's just how I felt as I had those conversations with the students.

00:51.529 --> 00:54.784
I was amazed at the ideas that they had,...

00:54.850 --> 00:58.442
...and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well,...

00:58.924 --> 01:02.419
...and I believe the key to opening that door is great communication.

01:02.832 --> 01:07.108
We desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers...

01:07.335 --> 01:08.562
...in order to change the world.

01:08.999 --> 01:13.880
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges,...

01:13.963 --> 01:17.251
...from energy to environment to health care, among others,...

01:18.011 --> 01:21.900
...and if we don't know about it and understand it, then the work isn't done,...

01:22.472 --> 01:26.463
...and I believe it's our responsibility as non-scientists to have these interactions.

01:26.999 --> 01:30.581
But these great conversations can't occur if our scientists and engineers...

01:30.647 --> 01:32.734
...don't invite us in to see their wonderland.

01:33.026 --> 01:37.809
So scientists and engineers, please, talk nerdy to us.

01:38.767 --> 01:41.111
I want to share a few keys on how you can do that...

01:41.207 --> 01:44.981
...to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy...

01:45.855 --> 01:47.555
...and that your engineering is engaging.

01:48.075 --> 01:51.187
First question to answer for us: So what?

01:51.605 --> 01:55.146
Tell us why your science is relevant to us.

01:55.546 --> 02:00.035
Don't just tell me that you study trabeculae, but tell me that you study trabeculae,...

02:00.112 --> 02:02.187
...which is the mesh-like structure of our bones...

02:02.574 --> 02:06.217
...because it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis.

02:07.315 --> 02:11.096
And when you're describing your science, beware of jargon.

02:11.313 --> 02:14.656
Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas.

02:14.939 --> 02:19.120
Sure, you can say "spatial and temporal," but why not just say "space and time,"...

02:19.206 --> 02:21.168
...which is so much more accessible to us?

02:21.725 --> 02:26.141
And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down.

02:26.639 --> 02:32.369
Instead, as Einstein said, make everything as simple as possible, but no simpler.

02:32.850 --> 02:37.884
You can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas.

02:38.475 --> 02:42.885
A few things to consider are having examples, stories and analogies.

02:42.949 --> 02:45.740
Those are ways to engage and excite us about your content.

02:46.362 --> 02:52.001
And when presenting your work, drop the bullet points.

02:52.351 --> 02:55.291
Have you ever wondered why they're called bullet points?

02:56.383 --> 02:57.493
What do bullets do?

02:57.778 --> 03:00.344
Bullets kill, and they will kill your presentation.
