This is a blueprint of what my Rube Goldberg machine will be like.

00:08.197 --> 00:11.391
There is rarely an occasion where I'll make a Rube Goldberg machine...

00:11.499 --> 00:12.681
...that works on the first try,...

00:13.022 --> 00:16.461
...but if I plan everything out well and I've tested out enough,...

00:16.909 --> 00:20.125
...sometimes if I get lucky and it will work on the first try.

00:25.165 --> 00:30.102
Big thing with this basically, a lot of times you just have to try and try again.

00:30.175 --> 00:31.983
Basically, it's all about trial and error.

00:36.039 --> 00:41.314
It's fascinating for me to see how all the parts work together to complete a task.

00:43.795 --> 00:48.081
Alright, attempt number five in 3, 2, 1.

00:51.081 --> 00:52.475
Alright, good, good.

00:52.601 --> 00:53.377
Alrighty.

00:53.957 --> 00:54.614
Come on, come on.

00:58.499 --> 00:59.192
Did that go in?

00:59.530 --> 01:00.459
Yes!
