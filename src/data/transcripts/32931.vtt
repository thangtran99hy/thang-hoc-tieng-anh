00:02.982 --> 00:06.833
If we show emotion, we're called dramatic.

00:09.397 --> 00:12.474
If we want to play against men, we're nuts.

00:14.401 --> 00:18.716
And if we dream of equal opportunity, delusional.

00:19.979 --> 00:23.563
When we stand for something, we're unhinged.

00:26.351 --> 00:29.783
When we're too good there's something wrong with us.

00:30.527 --> 00:31.822
And if we get angry...

00:32.323 --> 00:36.236
...we're hysterical, irrational or just being crazy.

00:37.813 --> 00:41.354
But, a woman running a marathon is crazy.

00:44.809 --> 00:47.175
A woman boxing was crazy.

00:47.835 --> 00:50.695
A woman dunking, crazy.

00:50.903 --> 00:53.887
Coaching an NBA team, crazy.

00:54.529 --> 00:56.244
A woman competing in a hijab.

00:56.709 --> 00:57.960
Changing her sport.

00:58.466 --> 01:00.459
Landing a double cork 1080.

01:01.263 --> 01:03.367
Or winning 23 grand slams,...

01:03.476 --> 01:05.976
...having a baby and then coming back for more.

01:06.631 --> 01:10.637
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy and crazy.

01:14.561 --> 01:18.721
So, if they want to call you crazy, fine.

01:19.443 --> 01:21.189
Show them what crazy can do.
