Being a man is, first and foremost, being a good human,...

00:07.503 --> 00:15.472
...and that means being responsible, being reliable, working hard,...

00:16.722 --> 00:22.927
...being kind, being respectful, being compassionate.

00:23.380 --> 00:29.181
The notion that somehow defining yourself as a man is dependent on:...

00:30.045 --> 00:34.187
Are you able to put someone else down instead of lifting them up?

00:34.381 --> 00:38.296
Are you able to dominate as opposed to support?

00:38.714 --> 00:41.110
That is an old view,...

00:42.773 --> 00:50.029
...and a view that, thankfully, I see a lot of young people rejecting.

00:50.827 --> 00:55.143
If you are very confident about your sexuality,...

00:55.958 --> 00:58.880
...you don't have to have eight women around you twerking.
