00:00.067 --> 00:02.231
I'm Kobe Bryant and I'm a basketball player.

00:02.351 --> 00:04.515
I'm Megan Blunk and I'm a basketball player.

00:04.905 --> 00:06.730
I've hit game-winning shots in overtime.

00:06.918 --> 00:08.627
I've hit the big shot at the buzzer.

00:09.077 --> 00:10.934
I put in countless hours of hard work.

00:11.003 --> 00:13.924
Countless hours of hard work so I can make the shot when it counts.

00:14.010 --> 00:15.862
...so I can make the shot when it counts.

00:16.084 --> 00:17.781
I've hit game-winning buzzer beaters.

00:17.845 --> 00:21.573
...game-winning buzzer beaters, but never from a wheelchair.

00:22.613 --> 00:25.004
I salute challenged athletes like Megan Blunk,...

00:25.317 --> 00:26.567
...the true heroes of sport.

00:26.752 --> 00:28.875
I'm a basketball player; thanks to CAF.
