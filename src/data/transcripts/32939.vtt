Hi, I'm Tiffany Young and this is everything I do in a day.

00:06.136 --> 00:09.512
My usual schedule is waking up around 10 a.m.

00:09.746 --> 00:14.536
When I actually get out of bed, the first thing I do is search for caffeine,...

00:14.629 --> 00:15.812
...and then hop into the shower,...

00:16.027 --> 00:16.997
...and then I head out.

00:17.161 --> 00:20.657
I have a notebook for rehearsal and I write down all the things we rehearse each day.

00:21.107 --> 00:22.961
Everything is at rehearsal at this point.

00:23.098 --> 00:24.295
I'm in downtown L.A.

00:24.521 --> 00:26.312
It starts usually at 12 p.m.

00:26.613 --> 00:29.971
We start from warming up, we'll be harmonizing for hours,...

00:30.147 --> 00:32.017
...going over the set list and the transition,...

00:32.101 --> 00:34.036
...and then we go song by song,...

00:34.470 --> 00:37.609
...and then we'll record it and I'll step back and I'll want to listen...

00:37.680 --> 00:41.439
...and see what we need to work on and yeah, lock in.

00:41.672 --> 00:44.333
Typical lunch, 30 to 40 minute break.

00:44.537 --> 00:48.963
I usually unwind at the rehearsal studio.

00:49.236 --> 00:51.025
8 p.m., meet friends for dinner.

00:51.249 --> 00:52.987
10 p.m., I need to hit the gym.

00:53.125 --> 00:57.410
At this point, I'm ready to kind of relax and unwind and go home.
