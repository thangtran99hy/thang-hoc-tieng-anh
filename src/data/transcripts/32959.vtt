00:00.470 --> 00:03.355
This is a chart of reported measles cases in the US.

00:03.771 --> 00:08.715
In the 1950s, measles was one of those diseases that nearly every child got.

00:09.267 --> 00:12.437
It caused a high fever and a spotty rash all over the body,...

00:12.760 --> 00:17.230
...and while most recovered easily, it still killed around 500 children each year.

00:17.751 --> 00:20.580
Then in 1963, a vaccine became available,...

00:20.860 --> 00:24.804
...and measles became an easily preventable and unnecessary disease.

00:24.997 --> 00:28.600
By 2000, measles was officially eliminated in the US,...

00:28.951 --> 00:31.869
...and for a time, less than a hundred Americans a year got it,...

00:32.124 --> 00:34.798
...but in the last decade, that number has started to grow.

00:35.317 --> 00:41.243
Now, there have been more cases through the first three months of 2019 than in all of 2018.

00:41.763 --> 00:42.831
Measles is back,...

00:42.986 --> 00:46.311
...and to understand why, you have to understand where it's back.

00:46.891 --> 00:48.753
Here are those recent measles cases again.

00:49.131 --> 00:52.143
If we look at the 2013 spike, we noticed something.

00:52.507 --> 00:55.486
A good chunk of those cases can be attributed to an outbreak...

00:55.559 --> 00:57.343
...among Orthodox Jews in New York.

00:57.841 --> 00:59.729
That huge spike in 2014?

00:59.943 --> 01:03.793
Most of those cases are all from one outbreak among the Amish in Ohio.

01:04.099 --> 01:08.229
2017, one outbreak in the Somali-American community in Minnesota.

01:08.560 --> 01:12.101
2018, different communities of New York Orthodox Jews,...

01:12.325 --> 01:14.132
...and again in 2019.

01:14.559 --> 01:15.553
What all of this shows...

01:15.625 --> 01:18.764
...is that the return of measles isn't as widespread as you might think.

01:18.978 --> 01:23.541
75% of recent cases have happened in these close-knit communities.

01:23.809 --> 01:27.381
Anti-vaccination misinformation can reach anyone,...

01:27.595 --> 01:30.827
...but it's in these small communities where it does the most damage.

01:31.128 --> 01:33.751
Most people in these communities are vaccinated.

01:33.969 --> 01:36.781
The problem starts when not enough people are vaccinated.

01:37.125 --> 01:39.790
It prevents them from reaching what's called herd immunity.

01:40.144 --> 01:44.397
If a group of people comes into contact with one person contagious with measles...

01:44.667 --> 01:46.257
...and none of them are vaccinated,...

01:46.703 --> 01:48.379
...virtually everyone will get sick.

01:49.304 --> 01:52.642
If 50% of the group is vaccinated, that's not enough.

01:53.007 --> 01:55.662
The rest are likely to get sick and spread the disease.

01:56.329 --> 01:59.198
But at a certain point, if enough people are vaccinated,...

01:59.701 --> 02:03.065
...they can actually protect the few that aren't vaccinated from getting sick,...

02:03.264 --> 02:06.355
...stopping the spread of the disease: herd immunity.

02:06.851 --> 02:10.043
This is important because there are people who can't get vaccinated...

02:10.119 --> 02:11.417
...because of their immune system:...

02:11.594 --> 02:14.207
...people like cancer patients and newborn babies.

02:14.415 --> 02:18.421
So, how do we make sure everyone who can get vaccinated does?

02:19.120 --> 02:22.538
Maybe the best way to make sure all communities reach herd immunity...

02:22.913 --> 02:25.030
...and protect those that can't be vaccinated...

02:25.281 --> 02:27.397
...is just not let them opt out in the first place.
