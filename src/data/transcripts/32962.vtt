These bones, sitting next to the skulls of other human ancestors...

00:05.154 --> 00:09.233
...are among the remains of three individuals that may add a new chapter...

00:09.326 --> 00:10.530
...to the book of humanity.

00:11.387 --> 00:16.575
Archaeologist Armand Mijares found the bones in a cave in a small Philippine island...

00:16.837 --> 00:20.914
...and says they are between 50 and 67,000 years old.

00:21.287 --> 00:24.629
By studying the collection that include bones from the foot and the femur,...

00:25.160 --> 00:28.433
...the bone that links the knee and the hip, and a selection of teeth,...

00:28.927 --> 00:33.691
...Mijares slowly came to the conclusion these bones may not be just ancient human bones...

00:34.078 --> 00:35.487
...but a new species.

00:35.746 --> 00:37.063
The creature was small.

00:37.281 --> 00:39.744
Its scientific name is Homo Luzonensis,...

00:39.825 --> 00:44.999
...and while it is certainly indigenous to the region, Mijares says it didn't die in the cave.

00:45.273 --> 00:48.861
Mijares also doesn't know what ultimately happened to the species...

00:49.014 --> 00:54.215
...but says the arrival of the larger, more robust humans may have led to its extinction.
