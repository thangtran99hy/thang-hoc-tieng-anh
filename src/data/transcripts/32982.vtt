What you're about to see are not paintings on canvas.

00:03.413 --> 00:08.082
They are real people painted to create the illusion of two-dimensional paintings.

00:08.563 --> 00:12.699
LA-based artist Alexa Meade turns her subjects into works of art.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.601
She paints on people in three-dimensional spaces...

00:15.776 --> 00:19.644
...in such a way to give the illusion they are two-dimensional paintings.

00:19.875 --> 00:22.911
And she can take a photograph of her subjects from any angle...

00:23.030 --> 00:24.064
...and they look flat.

00:24.864 --> 00:30.281
Alexa was a self-taught artist and she developed her style thanks to her interest in shadows.

00:30.799 --> 00:31.780
Alexa said,...

00:32.407 --> 00:33.955
...I didn't know that I would end up being an artist...

00:35.084 --> 00:37.066
...and then all of a sudden, I came up with this idea.

00:37.316 --> 00:39.559
I wondered what it'd look like to put black paint on the shadows...

00:39.979 --> 00:44.527
...and then I realized that if I put paint on top of things in the real world,...

00:44.714 --> 00:46.525
...I can make them look like a two-dimensional painting.
