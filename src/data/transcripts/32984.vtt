In late 2017, Netflix themselves released a surprising statistic...

00:04.645 --> 00:08.310
...that more than 8.4 million of their subscribers have 'binge-raced',...

00:08.414 --> 00:12.908
...which is where they watch an entire season of a show within 24 hours of its release.

00:13.030 --> 00:16.719
Their figures show that the countries with the most number of subscribers doing this...

00:16.795 --> 00:18.664
...are the US, Canada, and Denmark.

00:18.892 --> 00:22.057
Watching shows or movies is an increasingly enjoyable experience,...

00:22.161 --> 00:23.189
...and there's a reason for that.

00:23.397 --> 00:26.865
Taking part in fun activities triggers the release of dopamine in the brain,...

00:26.969 --> 00:29.937
...which rewards you with pleasure for doing the activity,...

00:30.026 --> 00:31.743
...and encourages the mind to continue.

00:31.910 --> 00:35.524
In fact, so much dopamine can be released when watching your favorite show...

00:35.589 --> 00:36.866
...that you experience a high,...

00:36.955 --> 00:39.967
...and even an addiction-like craving for this neurotransmitter.

00:40.081 --> 00:43.972
This process is the same as what the brain goes through with addiction to drugs,...

00:44.069 --> 00:45.558
...since your body doesn't distinguish...

00:45.641 --> 00:48.352
...between the different causes of pleasurable experiences.
