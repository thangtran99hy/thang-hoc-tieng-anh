Authoritarians are those who favor enforcing strict obedience to authority,...

00:04.096 --> 00:05.465
...especially that of the government,...

00:05.725 --> 00:07.247
...at the expense of personal freedom.

00:07.593 --> 00:09.163
It's pretty obvious when one is around,...

00:09.244 --> 00:12.709
...and is related to words like dictator, despot, draconian or tyrant.

00:12.927 --> 00:16.434
But why would anyone elect an authoritarian government?

00:16.510 --> 00:20.150
Researcher Erich Fromm hypothesized people's authoritarian voting...

00:20.299 --> 00:22.350
...stems from feelings of insecurity.

00:22.613 --> 00:25.994
Hitler was elected, in part, because of German fear of communism,...

00:26.087 --> 00:27.275
...and, according to researchers,...

00:27.509 --> 00:30.762
...when people are "faced with an uncertain world and lack of direction,..."

00:31.015 --> 00:33.501
"...they will escape from freedom," into security.

00:33.996 --> 00:37.412
Essentially, if a group of people feel their economic stability is in jeopardy,...

00:37.713 --> 00:39.204
....their safety is threatened in some way,...

00:39.276 --> 00:41.763
...or their country is no longer their own for some reason,...

00:41.855 --> 00:43.951
...then they may vote for an authoritarian regime...

00:44.039 --> 00:48.081
...who they believe can restore uniformity and security, and punish difference.
