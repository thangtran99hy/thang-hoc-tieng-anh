Here are a few tips that don't take a lot of time...

00:02.672 --> 00:04.791
...but can have huge security benefits.

00:05.117 --> 00:07.499
First, check if your data has been leaked.

00:08.033 --> 00:12.715
The website Have I Been Pwned has a database of information that has been exposed.

00:12.829 --> 00:16.593
You can input your info like an email address or old passwords...

00:16.677 --> 00:18.279
...to see if that data has been leaked.

00:18.480 --> 00:21.055
If it has, change those passwords right away.

00:21.284 --> 00:24.359
Use a password manager, like LastPass or 1Password.

00:24.521 --> 00:27.069
A password manager securely stores your passwords...

00:27.152 --> 00:31.055
...and can help you generate unique ones that are hard to crack with brute-force hacking.

00:31.569 --> 00:35.249
Additionally, setting up two-factor authentication for your accounts...

00:35.549 --> 00:38.953
...can prevent someone who has that password from accessing that account.

00:39.211 --> 00:41.917
If you're feeling overly vulnerable or paranoid,...

00:42.153 --> 00:44.469
...you can even purchase a device like YubiKey...

00:44.594 --> 00:46.541
...to add even more security to your accounts.
