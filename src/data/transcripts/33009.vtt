Hi, Mr. Switzer.

00:01.676 --> 00:03.493
I'm Jennifer from Speech Therapy.

00:03.585 --> 00:04.519
How are you doing today?

00:05.035 --> 00:05.485
I've been better.

00:05.743 --> 00:06.269
Okay.

00:06.428 --> 00:09.705
I just want to make sure before we get started that I'm talking to the right person,...

00:09.786 --> 00:11.261
...so I just want to check your name band.

00:11.328 --> 00:12.969
Can you tell me your name and your birthday?

00:13.051 --> 00:14.537
Max Switzer.

00:14.775 --> 00:17.263
11 / 25 / 1984.

00:17.982 --> 00:20.703
So first, I just want to take a look inside your mouth.

00:20.779 --> 00:21.452
Is that okay?

00:21.540 --> 00:23.187
Here's my flashlight, it's kind of big.

00:23.373 --> 00:24.784
Can you open real wide for me?

00:25.757 --> 00:27.481
Good, can you say uh-uh-uh?

00:27.583 --> 00:28.541
Uh-uh-uh.

00:28.705 --> 00:30.940
Good, can you stick your tongue out as far as you can?

00:31.155 --> 00:32.880
Good, and move it side to side.

00:33.604 --> 00:35.287
Perfect, and up and down.

00:36.873 --> 00:38.527
Great, and smile really big.

00:39.230 --> 00:40.879
Good, and pucker and say ooh.

00:41.607 --> 00:46.133
Good, any numbness or tingling in your face, your lips, your cheeks?

00:46.362 --> 00:46.850
No.

00:47.224 --> 00:48.073
It all feels normal?

00:48.151 --> 00:48.395
Yeah.

00:48.576 --> 00:48.954
Good.
