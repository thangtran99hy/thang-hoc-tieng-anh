Reuters reported exclusively on Sunday that Google's parent company Alphabet...

00:05.281 --> 00:10.055
...has suspended some business with Huawei, a major blow  to the Chinese tech giant...

00:10.142 --> 00:13.453
...that the US government has sought to blacklist around the world.

00:14.010 --> 00:15.663
A source close to the matter told Reuters...

00:15.744 --> 00:19.686
...that business requiring the transfer of hardware and software products,...

00:19.763 --> 00:23.219
...except those covered by open source licenses, is suspended,...

00:23.607 --> 00:28.306
...though details of the specific services were still being discussed internally at Google.

00:28.739 --> 00:31.743
The suspension means Huawei will immediately lose access...

00:31.840 --> 00:34.072
...to updates to the Android operating system,...

00:34.380 --> 00:37.223
...and the next version of its smartphones outside of China...

00:37.285 --> 00:40.732
...will also lose access to popular applications and services...

00:41.189 --> 00:43.408
...including the Google Play Store and Gmail.

00:44.025 --> 00:48.209
Last week, the Trump administration officially added Huawei to the trade blacklist,...

00:48.577 --> 00:52.605
...immediately enacting restrictions that will make it extremely difficult for Huawei...

00:52.663 --> 00:54.509
...to do business with US companies.

00:54.835 --> 00:57.427
But on Friday, the US Commerce Department told Reuters...

00:57.515 --> 01:00.183
...that it may soon scale back restrictions on Huawei,...

01:00.653 --> 01:05.138
...saying it's considering temporary licenses for the Chinese company's existing clients.

01:05.649 --> 01:08.483
The US believes Huawei's smartphones and network equipment...

01:08.553 --> 01:10.971
...could be used by China to spy on Americans.

01:11.290 --> 01:14.037
Huawei has repeatedly denied those allegations.

01:14.515 --> 01:15.637
The Google suspension comes...

01:15.737 --> 01:19.819
...as China strikes a more aggressive tone in its trade war with the United States...

01:20.190 --> 01:23.815
...and Beijing has suggested that a resumption in talks will be meaningless...

01:24.206 --> 01:26.241
...unless Washington changed course.
