Hi friends!

00:01.629 --> 00:02.180
How are you?

00:02.954 --> 00:07.509
I'm visiting a new city and I do not know where the places are.

00:08.672 --> 00:12.859
So let's learn how to ask for directions and give addresses in English.

00:13.897 --> 00:16.865
I'm going to ask for this kind man.

00:19.035 --> 00:22.976
Hello, excuse me, could you tell me where is the main square?

00:23.985 --> 00:28.713
To ask for directions, we can also use, "How do I get to the main square?"

00:29.006 --> 00:31.423
...or, "What's the best way to the main square?"

00:32.773 --> 00:34.719
Remember to be polite and say:...

00:34.800 --> 00:38.167
"Excuse me, could you tell me or can you tell me."

00:40.163 --> 00:42.573
Go straight on until you come to the square.

00:43.297 --> 00:45.414
And you know what's the best way to the station?

00:46.283 --> 00:51.062
The bus station is on the right and the train station is on the left.

00:51.363 --> 00:52.629
Great, thanks!
