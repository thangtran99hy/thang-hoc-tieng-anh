Today, we are going to learn the parts of the house.

00:04.085 --> 00:05.861
So I'm going to show you my apartment.

00:06.254 --> 00:07.221
I hope you like it!

00:08.485 --> 00:11.141
Just when we enter, there is a hall.

00:12.287 --> 00:15.221
This is the corridor where all the rooms are.

00:17.084 --> 00:19.265
Sleeping rooms are called bedrooms.

00:21.092 --> 00:23.666
And here I have a study where I work.

00:26.145 --> 00:31.417
This is the bathroom and the smaller one without a shower is the toilet.

00:33.313 --> 00:36.174
If you are hungry, you can cook in the kitchen.

00:37.939 --> 00:41.821
And this is the dining room with separated areas.

00:42.166 --> 00:44.779
The table for dining and the living room.

00:45.523 --> 00:50.241
My favorite site to take a nap because there are the armchairs and the television.

00:51.309 --> 00:54.293
Up the stairs there's the attic.

00:55.526 --> 01:00.616
And close by is a storage where I keep everything I do not use.

01:01.827 --> 01:05.989
My apartment has a nice terrace with a beautiful view of the city.

01:06.992 --> 01:08.118
Do you like my apartment?
