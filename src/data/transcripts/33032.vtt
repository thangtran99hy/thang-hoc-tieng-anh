00:00.607 --> 00:01.540
To compete with Airbus,...

00:01.744 --> 00:06.290
...Boeing's obvious move was to upgrade the engine on their single-aisle plane, the 737,...

00:06.530 --> 00:07.710
...but there is one issue.

00:08.603 --> 00:11.915
Here's a sketch of the 737 next to the Airbus A320.

00:13.399 --> 00:16.751
Notice how the 737 is lower to the ground than the A320.

00:17.385 --> 00:20.621
This meant Airbus could slide a new engine under the wing of their A320,...

00:21.894 --> 00:24.920
...but there wasn't enough room under the wing of the Boeing 737.

00:26.263 --> 00:30.768
Their solution was to move up the engine on the wing so that it would be slightly higher....

00:31.267 --> 00:32.957
...and it would fit on their 737s.

00:34.195 --> 00:37.477
When the 737 MAX was in full thrust, like during takeoff,...

00:37.998 --> 00:41.175
...the nose tended to point too far upward, which could lead to a stall.

00:41.849 --> 00:46.287
This was a problem because these planes were supposed to behave exactly like the old ones,...

00:46.889 --> 00:48.471
...so Boeing came up with a workaround.

00:49.634 --> 00:51.333
Instead of re-engineering the planes,...

00:51.750 --> 00:55.009
...they installed software that automatically pushed the nose downward...

00:55.107 --> 00:57.321
...if the pilot flew the plane at too high of an angle.
