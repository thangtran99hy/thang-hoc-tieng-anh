Buying stocks makes those investors partial owners  in the business.

00:04.680 --> 00:06.819
Their investment helps the company to grow...

00:07.097 --> 00:08.658
...and as it becomes more successful,...

00:08.831 --> 00:12.046
...more buyers may see potential and start buying stocks.

00:12.436 --> 00:15.765
As demand for those stocks increases, so does their price,...

00:15.989 --> 00:18.278
...increasing the cost for prospective buyers...

00:18.511 --> 00:22.329
...and raising the value of the company's stocks people already own.

00:22.791 --> 00:26.913
For the company, this increased interest helps fund new initiatives...

00:27.170 --> 00:29.757
...and also boosts its overall market value...

00:29.967 --> 00:33.332
...by showing how many people are willing to invest in their idea.

00:33.808 --> 00:37.527
However, if for some reason a company starts to seem less profitable,...

00:37.680 --> 00:39.317
...the reverse can also happen.

00:39.972 --> 00:42.822
If investors think their stock value is going to decline,...

00:43.085 --> 00:45.842
...they'll sell their stocks with the hopes of making a profit...

00:46.075 --> 00:47.976
...before the company loses more value.

00:48.389 --> 00:51.293
As stocks are sold and demand for the stock goes down,...

00:51.526 --> 00:55.120
...the stock price falls, and with it, the company's market value.
