00:00.592 --> 00:03.978
The Colosseum was, and still is, colossal.

00:04.241 --> 00:07.071
It's the great example of ancient Roman engineering.

00:07.346 --> 00:11.395
It was begun in 72 AD during the reign of Emperor Vespasian...

00:11.506 --> 00:13.210
...when the empire was nearing its peak.

00:13.859 --> 00:18.391
Using Roman-pioneered concrete, brick and their trademark round arches,...

00:18.593 --> 00:21.701
...Romans constructed much larger buildings than the Greeks,...

00:22.339 --> 00:26.246
...but it seems they still respected the fine points of Greek culture.

00:26.630 --> 00:31.111
They decorated their no-nonsense megastructure with all three Greek orders of columns:...

00:31.259 --> 00:34.801
...Doric, Ionic and Corinthian.

00:35.967 --> 00:39.515
Stepping inside, you can almost hear the roar of ancient Rome.

00:40.331 --> 00:43.005
Take a moment to imagine the place in action.

00:43.805 --> 00:46.861
Romans filled and emptied the Colosseum's 50,000 seats...

00:47.106 --> 00:50.709
...as quickly and efficiently as we do our super stadiums today.
