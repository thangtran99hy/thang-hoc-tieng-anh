University of Washington doctors are seen here doing heart surgery using catheters.

00:06.596 --> 00:08.503
These long tubes reach into the heart...

00:08.604 --> 00:11.881
...and allow doctors to perform non-invasive heart surgery.

00:12.257 --> 00:14.390
Doctor Mark Reisman is better at it...

00:14.485 --> 00:18.831
...now that he gets to practice using an exact 3D model of this heart...

00:18.966 --> 00:23.060
...created by 3D printers using ultrasound scans.

00:23.408 --> 00:29.697
So what this allows us to do, these 3D prints, is allows us to physically see the heart...

00:30.079 --> 00:33.342
...and then to understand the nuances of the anatomy,...

00:33.729 --> 00:38.173
...both the anatomy itself but also how the anatomy within the heart...

00:38.324 --> 00:39.807
...is related to other structures.

00:39.947 --> 00:43.561
Dmitry Levin feeds ultrasound data into a 3D printer.

00:43.783 --> 00:46.790
It creates a model accurately and quickly.

00:47.118 --> 00:49.667
One of the huge advantages is the turnaround time...

00:49.865 --> 00:53.222
...so the time between when I get the data set and when I deliver the model...

00:53.513 --> 00:56.839
...could be cut down tremendously into hours instead of days.

00:57.363 --> 01:02.625
Quick turnaround allows Reisman to plan his surgery in ways he's never been able to before.

01:03.115 --> 01:06.867
In the types of procedures that I do, I think what it does is...

01:06.978 --> 01:10.307
...it gives me an opportunity to rehearse the procedure beforehand...

01:10.687 --> 01:11.852
...which is very, very powerful.

01:12.485 --> 01:16.138
Because as opposed to me doing these procedures...

01:16.222 --> 01:22.261
...and engaging the various valves for the first time when I'm doing it on a patient,...

01:22.482 --> 01:24.953
...I could actually practice that outside the patient.

01:25.285 --> 01:29.767
Recent studies show that most aortic valve surgeries are done via catheter...

01:29.993 --> 01:32.489
...than more dangerous open-heart surgery.
