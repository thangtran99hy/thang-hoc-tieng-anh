00:03.447 --> 00:04.713
Regular exercise.

00:07.332 --> 00:08.341
A healthy diet.

00:08.633 --> 00:13.434
Maintaining healthy blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels...

00:14.037 --> 00:16.953
...helps stave off dementia as we grow older.

00:17.568 --> 00:19.812
Dementia is not a normal part of aging.

00:20.137 --> 00:22.458
But age is a huge risk factor.

00:23.091 --> 00:27.213
As people live longer, health agencies and researchers around the world...

00:27.595 --> 00:31.262
...are focusing on ways to prevent, stop or treat dementia...

00:31.592 --> 00:35.987
...including Alzheimer's disease, one of the most common types of dementia.

00:36.547 --> 00:37.533
Alright, are you good?

00:38.687 --> 00:39.363
Let's do it.

00:40.058 --> 00:45.499
David Shorr is about to undergo a new procedure for early stage Alzheimer's disease.

00:46.165 --> 00:51.520
A layer of cells called a blood brain barrier protects the brain from infection.

00:52.110 --> 00:56.361
It also makes it difficult to treat neurodegenerative diseases.

00:57.209 --> 01:00.533
Shorr was diagnosed with Alzheimer's at age 56.

01:00.978 --> 01:04.519
He and his wife are open to trying any new treatment that might help.

01:04.969 --> 01:08.061
Dr. Vibhor Krishna told them about the clinical trial.

01:09.335 --> 01:13.019
Shorr became part of a new clinical trial that tests a procedure...

01:13.093 --> 01:17.650
...that uses MRI guided imaging to target the part of the brain...

01:18.015 --> 01:20.561
...responsible for memory and cognition.

01:21.181 --> 01:26.230
That's where Alzheimer's patients have a buildup of toxic proteins called amyloid.

01:26.647 --> 01:31.300
Simply opening this barrier might help clear amyloid from the brain.

01:31.811 --> 01:35.789
Opening the barrier may one day allow doctors to deliver medication...

01:35.851 --> 01:37.866
...straight to the site of the disease.

01:38.405 --> 01:40.955
Shorr is glad to be part of a trial...

01:41.286 --> 01:46.367
...that could help patients like himself in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.

01:47.305 --> 01:49.531
