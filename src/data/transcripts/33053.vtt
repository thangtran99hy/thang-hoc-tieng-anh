00:00.501 --> 00:03.114
Most plants grow in the ground.

00:04.575 --> 00:06.878
They begin as a seed.

00:07.393 --> 00:10.625
The seed opens up to a budding plant.

00:11.150 --> 00:15.930
Part of the seed grows up toward the warmth of the sun above the dirt.

00:16.523 --> 00:19.755
Part of the seed grows down into the ground.

00:20.515 --> 00:26.471
The part that grows mostly beneath the dirt is called the root of the plant.

00:26.904 --> 00:32.069
The part that grows up above the ground is the stem of the plant...

00:32.384 --> 00:35.044
...or the trunk of the tree.

00:38.658 --> 00:43.747
Some tree roots are so big, you can see them growing above the ground.

00:46.799 --> 00:52.941
The root absorbs or soaks up water and nutrients or food in the soil.

00:53.891 --> 00:58.899
This water and food goes up into the stem or trunk of the tree...

00:59.277 --> 01:02.756
...and out to the leaves, flowers and fruit.

01:04.928 --> 01:09.522
Roots also grip the Earth and keep the plant from falling over.

01:10.214 --> 01:14.684
Plants grow toward the sun because they need sunlight to live.

01:15.355 --> 01:20.883
The leaves grow out from the plant to catch and use the sunlight and air...

01:21.204 --> 01:23.693
...to produce more food for the plant.

01:24.240 --> 01:28.525
A plant needs food and energy from the sun.
