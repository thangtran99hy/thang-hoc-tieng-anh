We appear to want leaders who are charming and entertaining,...

00:03.689 --> 00:07.912
...but there is a big difference between an effective leader and a stand-up comedian.

00:09.215 --> 00:13.357
In fact, the best leaders are humble rather than charismatic,...

00:13.483 --> 00:16.405
...to the point of even being rather boring.

00:17.461 --> 00:21.619
This is why they rarely feature in the media or blockbuster movies.

00:21.808 --> 00:24.668
For example, imagine a movie on Angela Merkel.

00:26.370 --> 00:29.478
She wakes up, has breakfast with her husband,...

00:30.110 --> 00:31.917
...goes to meetings well-prepared,...

00:32.311 --> 00:35.357
...lets other people talk without interrupting them,...

00:36.384 --> 00:39.925
...makes rational decisions, runs her country well.

00:40.589 --> 00:42.176
There are no scandals about her.

00:43.573 --> 00:47.734
In contrast, there is a surplus of captivating biopics...

00:48.050 --> 00:51.069
...on charismatic leaders with a fascinating dark side,...

00:51.184 --> 00:53.858
...who end up ruining their countries and organizations.
