Singapore is an exciting hot pot of Chinese, Malay and Indian cultures,...

00:05.413 --> 00:12.428
...and the best way to experience this diversity is fabulous, boom, beautiful, insane food.

00:13.075 --> 00:13.437
Let's go eat.

00:13.795 --> 00:16.860
This is the essence of a Singapore breakfast right here.

00:17.063 --> 00:19.262
You've got to break the yolks, mix it up.

00:19.649 --> 00:20.713
Now here comes the magic.

00:20.833 --> 00:21.799
Look at this Kaya toast.

00:21.869 --> 00:23.112
So this is coconut jam,...

00:23.403 --> 00:26.094
...a little bit of egg yolk and dip it right in there.

00:35.486 --> 00:36.130
Wow!

00:36.291 --> 00:37.777
Look at all the stuff in there.

00:38.089 --> 00:41.601
Just going to dip this chicken murtabak into this spicy curry.

00:44.454 --> 00:44.924
Wow!

00:46.419 --> 00:48.417
Each bite is packed with flavor.

00:48.747 --> 00:52.183
It's crispy, it's fluffy; it's just beyond delicious.

00:52.609 --> 00:55.427
This is an Indian dish with a Singapore twist.

01:01.134 --> 01:03.573
Look at this beautiful bowl.

01:03.772 --> 01:08.700
It's a creamy, creamy laksa broth with cockles, fish cakes, laksa leaves...

01:08.805 --> 01:10.424
...and a chili paste that you mix in.

01:10.985 --> 01:11.629
We're going to try it out.

01:14.205 --> 01:14.879
Oh, wow.

01:15.769 --> 01:17.383
That's a flavor sensation.

01:17.843 --> 01:19.497
It's spicy, sweet,...

01:19.771 --> 01:20.579
...a little sour.

01:20.822 --> 01:23.627
The cockles give it this really nice fishy flavor.

01:23.922 --> 01:24.435
I'm in heaven.

01:24.965 --> 01:26.769
Chili crab, wow!

01:27.013 --> 01:31.251
Just look at how soft and delicate that claw meat is.

01:34.693 --> 01:38.752
Singapore would not be Singapore without the chili crab.

01:39.543 --> 01:40.643
I just can't talk anymore.

01:41.287 --> 01:42.125
I just got to keep going here.
