When I originally planned my trip to Israel,...

00:03.944 --> 00:06.151
...I thought I would focus the majority of my travels...

00:06.260 --> 00:08.149
...on the religious and cultural sites.

00:08.724 --> 00:13.719
However, upon arrival, I was blown away by Israel's flourishing culinary scene.

00:15.232 --> 00:18.059
Much of the Israeli diet is vegetarian-based,...

00:18.939 --> 00:21.801
...but it's so tasty that you'll forget there's no meat.

00:26.743 --> 00:27.381
Thank you so much.

00:27.750 --> 00:31.761
So, I'm walking around Carmel Market and I came across this stand that sells druze.

00:32.233 --> 00:36.512
It's kind of like a Israeli crepe that has a lot of salty goodness inside.

00:37.378 --> 00:38.284
Druze.

00:38.606 --> 00:41.554
Traditionally served with homemade cheese made from yogurt,...

00:41.973 --> 00:46.333
...drizzled with olive oil, za'atar and rolled in the crepe-thin pita,...

00:46.825 --> 00:49.047
...this dish is delicious to eat freshly made.

00:49.761 --> 00:52.056
I've never had it, so this is going to be my first bite.

00:57.256 --> 00:57.925
That's creamy.

00:59.087 --> 01:02.835
I highly recommend coming out to Carmel Market and checking out the foods they have.

01:03.828 --> 01:05.572
You can see them prepared right in front of your eyes.

01:06.529 --> 01:07.261
Sabich.

01:08.137 --> 01:13.739
This Jewish-Iraqi delicacy is a heavenly mixture of fried eggplant, hard-boiled eggs,...

01:13.869 --> 01:17.913
...green onions, tomatoes, parsley, tahini; the list could go on.

01:19.694 --> 01:20.390
Oh, yeah!

01:21.147 --> 01:22.373
This is sabich.

01:22.527 --> 01:25.855
It comes in two forms: with pita or with normal sandwich bread.

01:27.167 --> 01:29.348
This is one of my favorite Israeli foods.

01:33.069 --> 01:36.811
It is a vegetarian masterpiece and one that should not be missed here in Israel.

01:40.031 --> 01:41.520
All right, we're at dinner now.

01:41.843 --> 01:43.235
We got two hummuses here.

01:43.653 --> 01:47.313
We got hummus with artichoke and we've got hummus with mushroom,...

01:48.274 --> 01:49.822
...but that's not the specialty tonight.

01:50.236 --> 01:51.769
The specialty is malabi.

01:54.321 --> 01:59.114
On my last night in Israel, I was introduced to malabi, a cream-based dessert...

01:59.605 --> 02:02.856
...flavored with rose water and topped with pistachios.

02:11.976 --> 02:12.842
Oh man, that's good!

02:13.765 --> 02:15.825
You can actually taste the rose water inside of it.

02:17.115 --> 02:18.626
It's like nothing I've ever tasted before.
