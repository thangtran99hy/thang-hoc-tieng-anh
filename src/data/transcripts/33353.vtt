00:12.887 --> 00:14.536
When I was 27 years old,...

00:14.983 --> 00:17.819
...I left a very demanding job in management consulting...

00:18.311 --> 00:21.840
...for a job that was even more demanding: teaching.

00:23.267 --> 00:27.555
I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools.

00:28.193 --> 00:30.996
And like any teacher, I made quizzes and tests.

00:31.185 --> 00:32.621
I gave out homework assignments.

00:33.106 --> 00:35.720
When the work came back, I calculated grades.

00:36.811 --> 00:44.398
What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.

00:45.067 --> 00:49.861
Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores.

00:50.374 --> 00:53.646
Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.717
And that got me thinking.

00:56.334 --> 00:59.055
The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math,...

00:59.451 --> 01:04.031
...sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals, the area of a parallelogram.

01:04.592 --> 01:06.813
But these concepts are not impossible,...

01:07.307 --> 01:13.584
...and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material...

01:14.079 --> 01:15.581
...if they worked hard and long enough.

01:16.752 --> 01:18.877
After several more years of teaching,...

01:19.361 --> 01:22.735
...I came to the conclusion that what we need in education...

01:23.050 --> 01:28.495
...is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective,...

01:28.967 --> 01:31.026
...from a psychological perspective.

01:31.757 --> 01:37.139
In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ.

01:38.183 --> 01:41.674
But what if doing well in school and in life...

01:42.129 --> 01:47.632
...depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily?

01:48.328 --> 01:53.145
So I left the classroom, and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist.

01:53.725 --> 01:58.568
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings,

01:59.042 --> 02:03.795
...and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
