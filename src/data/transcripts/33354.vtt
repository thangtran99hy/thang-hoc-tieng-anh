My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy.

00:04.390 --> 00:09.425
We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out.

00:10.377 --> 00:12.239
We went to the National Spelling Bee...

00:12.607 --> 00:16.829
...and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition.

00:17.789 --> 00:21.489
We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods,...

00:21.873 --> 00:26.767
...asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year,...

00:27.301 --> 00:32.866
...and of those, who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students?

00:33.502 --> 00:35.552
We partnered with private companies, asking,...

00:35.815 --> 00:38.032
...which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs?

00:38.428 --> 00:39.753
And who's going to earn the most money?

00:40.709 --> 00:42.606
In all those very different contexts,...

00:43.460 --> 00:47.785
...one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success.

00:48.317 --> 00:50.015
And it wasn't social intelligence.

00:50.489 --> 00:54.793
It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ.

00:55.628 --> 00:56.593
It was grit.

00:57.837 --> 01:02.383
Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals.

01:02.985 --> 01:04.491
Grit is having stamina.

01:05.215 --> 01:09.064
Grit is sticking with your future day in day out,...

01:09.391 --> 01:13.805
...not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years,...

01:14.392 --> 01:18.042
...and working really hard to make that future a reality.

01:18.855 --> 01:22.941
Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint.

01:24.114 --> 01:28.386
A few years ago, I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools.

01:29.005 --> 01:32.885
I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires,...

01:33.324 --> 01:36.563
...and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate.

01:37.451 --> 01:42.387
Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate,...

01:42.885 --> 01:46.381
...even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure,...

01:46.683 --> 01:51.241
...things like family income, standardized achievement test scores,...

01:51.736 --> 01:54.634
...even how safe kids felt when they were at school.

01:55.299 --> 01:58.983
So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters.

01:59.331 --> 02:03.783
It's also in school, especially for kids at risk for dropping out.
