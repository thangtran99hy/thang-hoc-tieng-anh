To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know,..

00:05.880 --> 00:08.103
...how little science knows about building it.

00:08.768 --> 00:10.943
Every day, parents and teachers ask me,...

00:11.278 --> 00:13.007
..."How do I build grit in kids?

00:13.304 --> 00:16.093
What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic?

00:16.491 --> 00:18.890
How do I keep them motivated for the long run?"

00:19.623 --> 00:22.368
The honest answer is I don't know.

00:24.227 --> 00:26.747
What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty.

00:27.297 --> 00:31.767
Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals...

00:32.040 --> 00:34.979
...who simply do not follow through on their commitments.

00:35.535 --> 00:36.782
In fact, in our data,...

00:37.061 --> 00:42.803
...grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent.

00:44.242 --> 00:47.841
So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids...

00:48.411 --> 00:50.439
...is something called "growth mindset."

00:51.149 --> 00:54.566
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck,...

00:54.889 --> 00:59.689
...and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed,...

01:00.129 --> 01:02.311
...that it can change with your effort.

01:03.225 --> 01:07.271
Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain...

01:07.573 --> 01:10.728
...and how it changes and grows in response to challenge,...

01:11.223 --> 01:14.838
...they're much more likely to persevere when they fail,...

01:15.222 --> 01:19.699
...because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.

01:20.788 --> 01:23.893
So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit.

01:24.413 --> 01:25.836
But we need more.

01:26.441 --> 01:29.554
And that's where I'm going to end my remarks because that's where we are.

01:29.845 --> 01:31.965
That's the work that stands before us.

01:32.356 --> 01:35.917
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions,...

01:36.204 --> 01:37.733
...and we need to test them.

01:38.248 --> 01:40.596
We need to measure whether we've been successful,...

01:40.960 --> 01:44.402
...and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong,...

01:44.792 --> 01:47.173
...to start over again with lessons learned.

01:48.057 --> 01:53.464
In other words, we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier.

01:54.085 --> 01:54.579
Thank you.
