But Mpemba was not the first person to observe this effect.

00:03.443 --> 00:05.991
It dates back at least to Aristotle who noted...

00:06.140 --> 00:10.264
..."The fact that the water has previously been warmed contributes to its freezing quickly:...

00:10.691 --> 00:12.257
...for so it cools sooner.

00:12.602 --> 00:17.292
Hence many people, when they want to cool hot water quickly, begin by putting it in the sun."

00:17.782 --> 00:22.815
Sir Francis Bacon wrote "Tepid water will freeze more easily than water which is altogether cold."

00:23.080 --> 00:25.516
...and Descartes in his essay on meteorology states...

00:25.706 --> 00:29.689
..."We can also see by experiment that water which has been kept hot for a long time...

00:29.784 --> 00:33.105
...freezes faster than any other sort, because those of its parts...

00:33.233 --> 00:36.733
...which can least cease to bend evaporate while it is being heated."

00:37.117 --> 00:41.569
So the observation that hot water freezes faster has a long and illustrious history.
