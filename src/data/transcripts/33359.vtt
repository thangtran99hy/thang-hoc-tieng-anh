Does hot water freeze faster than cold water?

00:03.165 --> 00:06.422
The obvious answer seems to be no because all else being equal,...

00:06.485 --> 00:09.787
...the hot water first has to cool down to the same temperature as the cold water...

00:10.063 --> 00:13.096
...and do everything the cold water has to do in order to freeze.

00:13.158 --> 00:14.799
So it must take longer, right?

00:15.332 --> 00:17.841
Well, not according to the Mpemba Effect.

00:18.028 --> 00:22.929
This effect is named after Erasto Mpemba who in 1963 was a Tanzanian student...

00:23.213 --> 00:25.145
...making ice cream as a school project.

00:25.563 --> 00:28.409
The students were meant to boil a mixture of cream and sugar...

00:28.495 --> 00:31.199
...and then let it cool down before putting it into the freezer...

00:31.556 --> 00:32.873
...but worried about not getting a spot,...

00:32.962 --> 00:36.494
...Mpemba put his mixture into the freezer immediately after boiling it...

00:36.853 --> 00:40.241
...and returning an hour and a half later, he found that his mixture had frozen...

00:40.353 --> 00:41.836
...while his classmates had not.

00:42.396 --> 00:44.621
Mpemba was intrigued by this phenomenon...

00:44.718 --> 00:48.007
...and eventually enlisted the help of a physics professor Dennis Osborne...

00:48.266 --> 00:51.357
...to investigate the effect using cream and also water.

00:51.800 --> 00:55.259
And they managed to replicate Mpemba's finding and published a physics paper...

00:55.328 --> 00:58.315
...stating that warm water does indeed freeze faster than cold.
