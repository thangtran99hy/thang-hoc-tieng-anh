Another thing Albrecht Durer used his sketchbook for,...

00:03.303 --> 00:05.600
...was practicing drawing difficult things...

00:05.713 --> 00:08.573
...that he wanted to include in more finished works of art.

00:09.001 --> 00:12.068
For instance, this sketch here of this pair of feet,...

00:12.275 --> 00:16.655
...perhaps helped him accurately draw the feet of the man in this etching he made later.

00:32.347 --> 00:35.841
Albrecht Durer drew in his sketchbook to help him observe nature...

00:35.918 --> 00:38.288
...and to help him improve his drawing skills.
