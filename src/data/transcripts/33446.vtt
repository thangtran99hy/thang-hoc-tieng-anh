Albrecht Durer was a Renaissance artist.

00:03.251 --> 00:06.576
The Renaissance was a rediscovery of art, architecture,...

00:06.815 --> 00:09.272
...and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome.

00:09.952 --> 00:14.175
People during the Renaissance were also really interested in studying nature...

00:14.392 --> 00:17.134
...and learning all they could from the natural world.

00:22.693 --> 00:26.049
Artists like Albrecht Durer made many drawings of animals and plants.

00:26.411 --> 00:29.035
Remember, this was before photography was invented,...

00:29.271 --> 00:30.674
...if you wanted to look at an animal,...

00:30.827 --> 00:33.315
...you either had to have the animal in front of you,...

00:33.623 --> 00:35.462
...or you had to have a drawing of the animal.

00:36.198 --> 00:40.513
Albrecht Durer filled his sketchbooks with drawings of animals he had observed.

00:40.934 --> 00:42.927
Imagine how difficult this might have been.

00:43.319 --> 00:46.837
You can't exactly ask an animal to sit still while you draw them, can you?
