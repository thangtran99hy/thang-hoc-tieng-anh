Wearing a blue cap, face mask and work clothes,...

00:04.742 --> 00:10.298
...a disguised Carlos Ghosn emerged Wednesday after 108 days in jail.

00:10.821 --> 00:15.478
Eluding hundreds of reporters, he slipped away unnoticed in a small van.

00:16.046 --> 00:19.335
Earlier, family members were seen entering the facility.

00:19.751 --> 00:24.803
Ghosn was released on nearly 9 million dollars bail, paid in cash.

00:25.417 --> 00:29.917
As part of the terms, he will have to surrender his passport, be monitored at home...

00:30.133 --> 00:32.935
...and have restricted phone and computer access.

00:33.634 --> 00:37.342
Ghosn was taken into custody in a dramatic scene last November,...

00:37.473 --> 00:40.599
...shortly after his arrival at Tokyo's Haneda airport.

00:41.143 --> 00:45.621
He's accused of underreporting his income by roughly 80 million dollars,...

00:46.007 --> 00:49.944
...and using his position as CEO of Nissan for financial gain,...

00:50.405 --> 00:53.758
...charges which carry a maximum 10 years' prison term.

00:54.601 --> 00:59.839
He has declared himself innocent of all charges, which he termed unsubstantiated.

01:00.415 --> 01:02.971
His release is highly unusual for Japan,...

01:03.238 --> 01:07.429
...where white-collar defendants usually are forced to await their trials in custody.

01:08.040 --> 01:12.937
After two previous rejections, his lawyers successfully argued for his release,...

01:13.268 --> 01:18.168
...capitalizing on growing international criticism of Japan's criminal justice system.

01:18.792 --> 01:22.258
However, Ghosn's chances of acquittal remain unclear.

01:22.684 --> 01:27.390
Last year, Japan's conviction rate was about 98%.
