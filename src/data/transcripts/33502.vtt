The most interesting things that we should know about the solar system are the planets.

00:05.759 --> 00:10.122
Let's look at them, starting with the ones closest to the sun...

00:10.551 --> 00:12.261
...and then getting further away!

00:16.500 --> 00:25.968
The closest planet to the sun is Mercury; then there is Venus; then comes the Earth.

00:26.183 --> 00:28.315
Yes, our planet where we live.

00:29.445 --> 00:39.275
Then there is Mars, Jupiter, the largest planet, Saturn, Uranus...

00:39.979 --> 00:42.852
...and then the farthest away is Neptune.

00:46.975 --> 00:52.859
As you can see, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are closer to the sun...

00:53.166 --> 00:58.717
...and also smaller than Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
