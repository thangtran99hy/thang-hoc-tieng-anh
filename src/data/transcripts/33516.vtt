What's really keeping kids from wanting to eat healthy?

00:03.206 --> 00:08.018
From athletes pushing fast food, to fundraisers that leave kids peddling sugar,...

00:08.214 --> 00:11.462
...gold stars have been replaced with sneaky ad campaigns,...

00:11.648 --> 00:14.871
...and don't even get us started on those lion sports drinks.

00:16.871 --> 00:21.131
Each year, companies spend millions on food marketing to children in schools.

00:21.548 --> 00:22.663

00:23.429 --> 00:23.998

00:24.465 --> 00:29.187
For the sake of their hearts, keep junk food marketing out of school and out of mind.
