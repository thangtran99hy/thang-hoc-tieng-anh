00:00.462 --> 00:02.172
So what do you want to eat for lunch?

00:03.894 --> 00:05.455
I still don't know yet...

00:05.764 --> 00:09.506
...but mom said that I have to make sure that I eat a healthy meal every day.

00:10.152 --> 00:11.197
How do you do that?

00:12.266 --> 00:17.297
My food should have one go food, one grow food and one glow food.

00:18.069 --> 00:19.853
Go, grow and glow food?

00:20.432 --> 00:21.553
What are those?

00:22.117 --> 00:24.277
Food can be grouped into three groups.

00:24.580 --> 00:26.287
Go, grow and glow.

00:26.684 --> 00:28.175
Go food gives us energy.

00:28.806 --> 00:35.107
This kind of food contains carbohydrates like rice, bread, cereals and noodles.

00:35.623 --> 00:38.599
These help us run, jump and play all day.

00:39.047 --> 00:41.553
Grow food makes us grow bigger and stronger.

00:42.313 --> 00:43.953
It helps in the development of muscles.

00:44.675 --> 00:46.503
This kind of food gives us protein.

00:47.082 --> 00:50.253
Examples are meat, fish, milk, and egg.

00:50.757 --> 00:52.329
Glow food makes us look good.

00:52.913 --> 00:57.590
This kind of food makes our skin glow, our hair shine and our eyes sparkle.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.943
It gives us vitamins and minerals.

01:00.739 --> 01:02.842
Examples are fruits and vegetables.

01:03.514 --> 01:05.581
Now I know what a healthy meal is made of.

01:06.164 --> 01:07.964
I think I'll eat a sandwich today.

01:08.689 --> 01:12.303
It has bread, meat, lettuce, and tomatoes.

01:13.342 --> 01:14.108
Thanks, Candy.

01:14.465 --> 01:15.775
I learned a lot from you today.

01:16.532 --> 01:17.634
You're welcome, Dave.

01:17.906 --> 01:19.655
Learning is always fun.

01:20.002 --> 01:20.725
Let's go eat!

01:21.439 --> 01:24.850
Did you have fun learning about go, grow and glow foods?
