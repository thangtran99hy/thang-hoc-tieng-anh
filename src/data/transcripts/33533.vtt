Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are two technologies changing the way we use screens,...

00:06.095 --> 00:08.990
...creating new and exciting interactive experiences.

00:09.757 --> 00:15.025
Virtual Reality, also known as VR uses a headset with a built-in screen...

00:15.207 --> 00:18.115
...that displays a virtual environment for you to explore.

00:19.014 --> 00:21.847
These headsets use a technology called "head tracking"...

00:22.060 --> 00:25.578
...which allows you to look around the environment by simply moving your head.

00:26.512 --> 00:29.455
Augmented Reality or AR is a bit different.

00:29.901 --> 00:32.375
Instead of transporting you to a virtual world,...

00:32.657 --> 00:36.180
...it takes digital images and layers them on the real world around you.

00:36.977 --> 00:40.647
This is done through the use of either a clear visor or a smartphone.

00:41.876 --> 00:45.719
So with VR, you could explore a world full of dinosaurs.

00:47.814 --> 00:52.158
But with AR, you could see those dinosaurs moving through the world around you.

00:53.407 --> 00:56.133
Both of these technologies are growing at a rapid pace...

00:56.235 --> 00:58.897
...and being implemented in a variety of different ways.

00:59.784 --> 01:04.207
Surgeons are using VR to practice highly technical surgeries before operating.

01:04.862 --> 01:09.694
Businesses are using them to give consumers virtual tours of products and locations.

01:10.269 --> 01:13.049
There are even apps that can use your smartphone's camera...

01:13.144 --> 01:16.532
...to scan and translate a foreign language in real time.
