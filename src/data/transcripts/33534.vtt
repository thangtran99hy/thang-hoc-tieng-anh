00:07.670 --> 00:09.418
Thirty plus years of service.

00:13.768 --> 00:14.898
Combat medals.

00:15.274 --> 00:16.231
Citations.

00:16.613 --> 00:19.983
Only man to shoot down three enemy planes in the last forty years.

00:24.453 --> 00:26.023
Yet, you can't get a promotion.

00:26.388 --> 00:27.471
You won't retire,...

00:27.645 --> 00:30.081
...and despite your best efforts, you refuse to die.

00:43.291 --> 00:46.151
You should be at least a two-star admiral by now.

00:46.968 --> 00:48.211
Yet, here you are.

00:49.585 --> 00:50.125
Captain.

00:51.989 --> 00:52.762
Why is that?

00:56.029 --> 00:57.317
It's one of life's mysteries, sir.

01:24.905 --> 01:26.663
The end is inevitable, Maverick.

01:27.073 --> 01:28.757
Your kind is headed for extinction.

01:30.349 --> 01:31.167
Maybe so, sir,...

01:33.599 --> 01:34.149
...but not today.
