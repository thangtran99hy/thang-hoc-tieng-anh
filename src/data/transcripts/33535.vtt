00:00.929 --> 00:02.312
You got the wrong name tags on.

00:02.715 --> 00:04.754
This is just a sample of our competence.

00:05.033 --> 00:07.325
If you think this is bad, wait until we really get into action.

00:07.887 --> 00:08.918
Yeah, just fill it up to that.

00:10.741 --> 00:13.061
Well, keep it going; you got to get two balls on there.

00:13.362 --> 00:14.722
Well, I'll see if I can do better.

00:19.413 --> 00:19.886
Oh my God.

00:20.893 --> 00:21.696
See, I'm very generous.

00:21.809 --> 00:24.089
They're gonna order from you from now on, not from me.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.147
Who had the bad luck to draw me?

00:28.489 --> 00:30.165
If you want anything later on, it's on me.

00:32.352 --> 00:33.227
The cone is okay.

00:34.623 --> 00:36.397
I would love a vanilla cone.

00:36.941 --> 00:38.225
A vanilla cone.

00:38.905 --> 00:39.838
Is that all you want today?

00:39.944 --> 00:40.513
That would do it.

00:45.419 --> 00:46.981
How long ago did you buy Dairy Queen,...

00:47.075 --> 00:48.715
...and what was it that made it look good?

00:49.234 --> 00:50.553
I've known Dairy Queen all my life.

00:50.679 --> 00:53.486
Dairy Queen actually started in the 1930s and...

00:53.732 --> 00:54.164
Wow!

00:54.732 --> 00:57.231
...and a couple of guys worked up soft ice cream...

00:57.325 --> 01:02.524
...and when they were contemplating selling, he thought of Berkshire,...

01:03.261 --> 01:04.949
...who, better than some guy, that loves the product,...

01:05.401 --> 01:09.983
...and we made a deal and we lived happily ever after.

01:10.783 --> 01:12.553
Hi, welcome to Dairy Queen.

01:12.844 --> 01:13.665
Can I take your order?

01:14.262 --> 01:16.726
I'll have small Oreo Blizzard.

01:17.135 --> 01:19.082
That would be three dollars and 23 cents.

01:19.457 --> 01:21.137
Can you pull forward to the next window?

01:24.453 --> 01:25.117
Okay.

01:25.223 --> 01:25.829
Oh wow!

01:26.100 --> 01:26.899
That is for you.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.207
Good job on this one.

01:28.283 --> 01:29.070
Love to have you here.

01:29.332 --> 01:29.849
Thank you.

01:30.291 --> 01:30.679
See you.
