Meet the three article brothers: "a", "an" and "the".

00:14.133 --> 00:17.399
All three brothers like to point out nouns.

00:20.415 --> 00:25.349
The twin articles "a" and "an" like to point out singular nouns.

00:27.403 --> 00:33.367
The elder brother "the" likes to point out both singular and plural nouns.

00:36.629 --> 00:43.820
"A" and "an" are usually seen with one person, one place, one animal, and one thing.

00:46.219 --> 00:49.407
Though they are twins, both have different hobbies.

00:51.305 --> 00:56.313
The article "a" is seen with noun that begins with consonants.

00:58.433 --> 01:13.317
For example: a bus, a cow, a girl, a zoo.

01:16.029 --> 01:21.069
The article "an" likes to listen to nouns beginning with vowel sounds.

01:22.927 --> 01:39.238
For example: an umbrella, an octopus, an ink bottle, an elephant.

01:41.205 --> 01:46.624
Come, let's look at a few sentences where these three article brothers appear together.

01:48.035 --> 01:49.617
That is a stall.

01:51.081 --> 01:53.848
There is an umbrella on the stall.

01:55.673 --> 02:03.281
Thus, we can say that articles "a" and "an" are used to introduce a singular noun.

02:04.007 --> 02:09.778
Article "the" is used when we talk about the introduced noun the second time.

02:10.815 --> 02:13.891
In this case, it is "the stall".
