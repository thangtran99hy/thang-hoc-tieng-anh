00:01.118 --> 00:02.945
Gentlemen, we are smokejumpers,...

00:03.325 --> 00:05.451
...the most elite team of firefighters in the world.

00:06.687 --> 00:08.035
We must be at our very best.

00:13.483 --> 00:16.050
Until we can get you back to your parents, I am legally bound to take care of you.

00:16.148 --> 00:16.787
So that's what I'm gonna do.

00:19.264 --> 00:21.780
And in turn, you're going to be obedient so we can do our job.

00:22.807 --> 00:25.189
And when you do this, when you go like that,...

00:25.769 --> 00:26.309
...it's not helpful.

00:28.561 --> 00:29.963
No shenanigans under my watch.

00:32.067 --> 00:35.143
Mean fireman, can't turn my neck.

00:35.261 --> 00:38.763
What needs to happen this second is you gotta watch your tone, little sister.

00:38.957 --> 00:39.331
Or what?

00:39.633 --> 00:41.506
Masher is coming to rock your world.

00:44.879 --> 00:45.265
No!

00:48.515 --> 00:49.129
What just happened?

00:49.399 --> 00:50.896
I think the baby just broke your dog, Supe.

00:51.559 --> 00:52.307
Good doggy.

00:53.440 --> 00:55.310
Guys, I found this cool Nerf guns!

00:55.649 --> 00:56.443
Those aren't Nerf guns!

01:05.475 --> 01:07.069
Whoa, what a rush!

01:10.856 --> 01:11.658
Boom, boom.

01:11.956 --> 01:12.263
Boom, boom?

01:12.355 --> 01:13.010
What's boom boom?

01:18.317 --> 01:19.087
Don't look at me.
