Throughout time, our people robbed, lied  and killed...

00:26.491 --> 00:30.818
...until one day, we found ourselves "noblemen,"...

00:33.499 --> 00:36.533
...but that nobility never came from chivalry.

00:38.665 --> 00:41.499
It came from being tough and ruthless.

00:51.943 --> 00:55.375
Real power is not found running off to war.

00:57.231 --> 01:03.952
Real power lies in understanding who it is you're truly fighting...

01:08.731 --> 01:10.615
...and how they can be defeated.

01:31.134 --> 01:32.308
I know you want to fight,...

01:33.583 --> 01:35.670
...but there are other ways of doing your duty.

01:38.113 --> 01:38.633
Come on.
