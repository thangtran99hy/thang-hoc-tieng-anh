00:10.802 --> 00:12.582

This is Soeharto Hills in East Kalimantan, one of the proposed sites for a fresh start.

00:20.214 --> 00:27.780
So the idea is to move the center of government to the new capital in Kalimantan.

00:28.625 --> 00:31.893
These rolling hills dotted with illegal plantations...

00:32.161 --> 00:37.297
...may soon be home to one and a half million civil servants and their families,...

00:37.499 --> 00:41.927

00:42.208 --> 00:45.991
...with early construction set to start within two years.
