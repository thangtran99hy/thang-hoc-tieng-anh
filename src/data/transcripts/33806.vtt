00:12.682 --> 00:17.886
When my father and I started a company to 3D-print human tissues and organs,...

00:18.682 --> 00:20.906
...some people initially thought we were a little crazy.

00:22.203 --> 00:27.037
But since then, much progress has been made, both in our lab and other labs around the world.

00:27.672 --> 00:30.387
And given this, we started getting questions like,...

00:30.953 --> 00:37.877
..."If you can grow human body parts, can you also grow animal products like meat and leather?"

00:39.244 --> 00:43.629
When someone first suggested this to me, quite frankly I thought they were a little crazy,...

00:44.649 --> 00:49.307
...but what I soon came to realize was that this is not so crazy after all.

00:49.704 --> 00:52.026
What's crazy is what we do today.

00:52.883 --> 00:56.367
I'm convinced that in 30 years, when we look back on today...

00:56.809 --> 01:00.223
...and on how we raise and slaughter billions of animals...

01:00.482 --> 01:02.813
...to make our hamburgers and our handbags,...

01:03.190 --> 01:06.679
...we'll see this as being wasteful and indeed crazy.

01:07.868 --> 01:13.896
Did you know that today, we maintain a global herd of 60 billion animals...

01:14.351 --> 01:18.665
...to provide our meat, dairy, eggs and leather goods?

01:19.791 --> 01:24.219
And over the next few decades, as the world's population expands to 10 billion,...

01:24.435 --> 01:27.790
...this will need to nearly double to 100 billion animals.

01:28.888 --> 01:32.234
But maintaining this herd takes a major toll on our planet.

01:32.531 --> 01:35.847
Animals are not just raw materials.

01:36.264 --> 01:37.559
They're living beings,...

01:37.965 --> 01:43.419
...and already our livestock is one of the largest users of land, fresh water...

01:43.878 --> 01:47.703
...and one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases which drive climate change.

01:48.319 --> 01:51.981
On top of this, when you get so many animals so close together,...

01:52.727 --> 01:57.778
...it creates a breeding ground for disease and opportunities for harm and abuse.

01:59.111 --> 02:01.231
Clearly, we cannot continue on this path...

02:01.590 --> 02:06.625
...which puts the environment, public health and food security at risk.

02:07.394 --> 02:14.461
There is another way, because essentially, animal products are just collections of tissues,...

02:15.523 --> 02:19.393
...and right now, we breed and raise highly complex animals...

02:19.837 --> 02:23.395
...only to create products that are made of relatively simple tissues.

02:24.210 --> 02:28.761
What if, instead of starting with a complex and sentient animal,...

02:29.751 --> 02:36.489
...we started with what the tissues are made of, the basic unit of life, the cell?

02:38.035 --> 02:41.513
This is biofabrication, where cells themselves...

02:41.778 --> 02:45.579
...can be used to grow biological products like tissues and organs.

02:46.364 --> 02:47.679
Already in medicine,...

02:48.130 --> 02:52.123
...biofabrication techniques have been used to grow sophisticated body parts,...

02:52.626 --> 02:57.333
...like ears, windpipes, skin, blood vessels and bone...

02:57.609 --> 03:00.497
...that have been successfully implanted into patients.

03:01.076 --> 03:08.896
And beyond medicine, biofabrication can be a humane, sustainable and scalable new industry.
