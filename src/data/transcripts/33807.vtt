I suspect that every aid worker in Africa comes to a time in her career...

00:17.901 --> 00:20.872
...when she wants to take all the money for her project,...

00:20.980 --> 00:25.692
...maybe it's a school or a training program, pack it in a suitcase,...

00:26.071 --> 00:29.377
...get on a plane flying over the poorest villages in the country...

00:30.375 --> 00:33.066
...and start throwing that money out the window.

00:33.791 --> 00:38.239
Because to a veteran aid worker, the idea of putting cold, hard cash...

00:38.536 --> 00:42.621
...into the hands of the poorest people on Earth doesn't sound crazy.

00:43.206 --> 00:45.877
It sounds really satisfying.

00:47.167 --> 00:49.519
I had that moment right about the ten-year mark,...

00:50.085 --> 00:55.524
...and luckily, that's also when I learned that this idea actually exists,...

00:55.959 --> 00:59.466
...and it might be just what the aid system needs.

01:00.047 --> 01:03.653
Economists call it an unconditional cash transfer, and it's exactly that.

01:04.007 --> 01:06.356
It's cash given with no strings attached.

01:07.053 --> 01:10.019
Governments in developing countries have been doing this for decades,...

01:10.097 --> 01:14.242
...and it's only now, with more evidence and new technology...

01:14.321 --> 01:18.940
...that it's possible to make this a model for delivering aid.

01:20.495 --> 01:22.465
It's a pretty simple idea, right?

01:23.023 --> 01:28.149
Well, why did I spend a decade doing other stuff for the poor?

01:29.322 --> 01:34.509
Honestly, I believed that I could do more good with money for the poor...

01:34.859 --> 01:36.795
...than the poor could do for themselves.

01:37.375 --> 01:41.003
I held two assumptions: One, that poor people are poor in part...

01:41.133 --> 01:44.360
...because they're uneducated and don't make good choices.

01:45.202 --> 01:50.924
Two, is that we then need people like me to figure out what they need and get it to them.

01:52.177 --> 01:55.709
It turns out, the evidence says otherwise.

01:56.440 --> 02:01.233
In recent years, researchers have been studying what happens when we give poor people cash.

02:02.069 --> 02:04.665
Dozens of studies show across the board...

02:04.819 --> 02:09.415
...that people use cash transfers to improve their own lives.

02:09.901 --> 02:14.552
Pregnant women in Uruguay buy better food and give birth to healthier babies.

02:15.166 --> 02:17.649
Sri Lankan men invest in their businesses.

02:18.320 --> 02:23.760
Researchers who studied our work in Kenya found that people invested in a range of assets...

02:23.841 --> 02:27.903
...from livestock to equipment to home improvements,...

02:28.345 --> 02:35.167
...and they saw increases in income from business and farming one year after the cash was sent.

02:36.385 --> 02:41.064
None of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking...

02:41.155 --> 02:43.189
...or that people work less.

02:43.714 --> 02:46.356
In fact, they work more.

02:48.027 --> 02:50.391
Now, these are all material needs.

02:50.547 --> 02:57.074
In Vietnam, elderly recipients used their cash transfers to pay for coffins.

02:58.499 --> 03:02.164
As someone who wonders if Maslow got it wrong,...

03:02.749 --> 03:08.747
...I find this choice to prioritize spiritual needs deeply humbling.
