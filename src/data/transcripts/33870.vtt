00:00.243 --> 00:03.755
And I want to illustrate this moment of finishing the history...

00:04.148 --> 00:06.267
...and beginning the actual examination of the patient.

00:06.344 --> 00:11.017
And I always think that a nice way to enter that moment is with the hand,...

00:11.090 --> 00:14.076
...rather than reaching straight for their chest or their neck...

00:14.189 --> 00:16.413
...which could be quite intimidating.

00:16.827 --> 00:21.328
It's a natural gesture to extend my hand, they extend their hand out.

00:21.743 --> 00:24.724
And in that gesture, which is very much like shaking the hand,...

00:25.151 --> 00:30.240
...I slide my right hand further down and my left hand begins to examine the pulse.

00:31.176 --> 00:35.120
And I'm registering things like rate, rhythm, volume,...

00:35.525 --> 00:37.549
...and interestingly, I think, most of the time,...

00:37.867 --> 00:40.568
...the patient also is aware you're hitting their pulse.

00:40.647 --> 00:43.166
So there's this moment of connection there.

00:43.720 --> 00:47.714
And meanwhile, my right hand is checking things like the warmth of the hand.

00:47.791 --> 00:51.846
Are they vasoconstricted or are they very warm?

00:51.923 --> 00:53.639
Is the hand sweaty?
