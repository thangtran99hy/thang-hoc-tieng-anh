00:12.799 --> 00:13.814
Where do you come from?

00:14.560 --> 00:16.683
It's such a simple question, but...

00:17.170 --> 00:21.410
...these days, of course, simple questions bring ever more complicated answers.

00:21.849 --> 00:27.296
People are always asking me where I come from, and they're expecting me to say India,...

00:28.051 --> 00:29.332
...and they're absolutely right,...

00:29.466 --> 00:34.353
...insofar as 100 percent of my blood and ancestry does come from India...

00:34.675 --> 00:38.379
...except I've never lived one day of my life there.

00:38.869 --> 00:43.989
I can't speak even one word of its more than 22,000 dialects,...

00:44.075 --> 00:47.945
...so I don't think I've really earned the right to call myself an Indian.

00:48.929 --> 00:53.063
And if "Where do you come from?" means "Where were you born and raised and educated?"...

00:53.435 --> 00:56.823
...then I'm entirely of that funny little country known as England,...

00:57.156 --> 01:01.275
...except I left England as soon as I completed my undergraduate education,...

01:01.512 --> 01:05.922
...and all the time I was growing up, I was the only kid in all my classes...

01:06.223 --> 01:11.135
...who didn't begin to look like the classic English heroes represented in our textbooks.

01:12.067 --> 01:14.827
And if "Where do you come from?" means "Where do you pay your taxes?

01:14.943 --> 01:16.805
Where do you see your doctor and your dentist?"...

01:17.403 --> 01:19.691
...then I'm very much of the United States,...

01:19.786 --> 01:24.265
...and I have been for 48 years now, since I was a really small child.

01:24.596 --> 01:26.005
Except, for many of those years,...

01:26.096 --> 01:29.308
...I've had to carry around this funny little pink card, with green lines...

01:29.433 --> 01:32.792
...running through my face, identifying me as a permanent alien.

01:33.139 --> 01:35.841
I do actually feel more alien the longer I live there.

01:37.080 --> 01:41.711
And if "Where do you come from?" means...

01:41.872 --> 01:43.919
..."Which place goes deepest inside you,...

01:44.163 --> 01:46.942
...and where do you try to spend most of your time?"...

01:47.447 --> 01:53.395
...then I'm Japanese, because I've been living as much as I can for the last 25 years in Japan.

01:54.125 --> 01:56.911
Except, all of those years I've been there on a tourist visa,...

01:56.994 --> 02:01.283
....and I'm fairly sure not many Japanese would want to consider me one of them.

02:02.285 --> 02:05.133
And I say all this just to stress...

02:05.408 --> 02:09.087
...how very old-fashioned and straightforward my background is,...

02:09.182 --> 02:12.744
...because when I go to Hong Kong or Sydney or Vancouver,...

02:13.395 --> 02:18.458
...most of the kids I meet are much more international and multicultured than I am.

02:18.848 --> 02:21.489
And they have one home associated with their parents,...

02:21.597 --> 02:24.729
...but another associated with their partners,...

02:24.993 --> 02:27.795
...a third connected maybe with the place where they happen to be,...

02:27.907 --> 02:32.772
...a fourth connected with the place they dream of being, and many more besides.

02:33.245 --> 02:38.337
And their whole life will be spent taking pieces of many different places...

02:38.698 --> 02:42.053
...and putting them together into a stained glass whole.

02:43.110 --> 02:45.324
Home for them is really a work in progress.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.612
It's like a project on which they're constantly adding...

02:47.785 --> 02:50.215
...upgrades and improvements and corrections.

02:51.184 --> 02:52.757
And for more and more of us,...

02:53.030 --> 02:59.774
....home has really less to do with a piece of soil, than you could say, with a piece of soul.
