I need to start by telling you a little bit about my social life,...

00:17.247 --> 00:20.410
...which I know may not seem relevant, but it is.

00:21.208 --> 00:25.405
When people meet me at parties and they find out that I'm an English professor...

00:25.803 --> 00:30.761
...who specializes in language, they generally have one of two reactions.

00:31.591 --> 00:34.163
One set of people look frightened.

00:36.347 --> 00:41.172
They often say something like, "Oh, I'd better be careful what I say.

00:41.368 --> 00:43.945
I'm sure you'll hear every mistake I make."

00:44.844 --> 00:46.601
And then they stop talking.

00:48.649 --> 00:52.392
And they wait for me to go away and talk to someone else.

00:53.602 --> 00:58.929
The other set of people, their eyes light up, and they say,...

00:59.105 --> 01:01.843
"You are just the person I want to talk to."

01:03.377 --> 01:05.701
And then they tell me about whatever it is...

01:05.853 --> 01:08.446
...they think is going wrong with the English language.

01:10.758 --> 01:13.007
A couple of weeks ago, I was at a dinner party...

01:13.159 --> 01:17.236
...and the man to my right started telling me about all the ways...

01:17.317 --> 01:19.830
...that the Internet is degrading the English language.

01:20.532 --> 01:25.225
He brought up Facebook, and he said, "To defriend?

01:25.679 --> 01:28.385
I mean, is that even a real word?"

01:29.738 --> 01:35.789
I want to pause on that question: What makes a word real?

01:36.677 --> 01:41.741
My dinner companion and I both know what the verb "defriend" means,...

01:42.300 --> 01:46.074
...so when does a new word like "defriend" become real?

01:47.139 --> 01:51.818
Who has the authority to make those kinds of official decisions about words, anyway?

01:53.011 --> 01:55.875
Those are the questions I want to talk about today.

01:57.169 --> 02:01.392
I think most people, when they say a word isn't real, what they mean is,...

02:01.483 --> 02:03.545
...it doesn't appear in a standard dictionary.

02:04.216 --> 02:09.979
That, of course, raises a host of other questions, including, who writes dictionaries?

02:12.198 --> 02:15.475
Before I go any further, let me clarify my role in all of this.

02:15.809 --> 02:17.400
I do not write dictionaries.

02:18.119 --> 02:23.071
I do, however, collect new words much the way dictionary editors do,...

02:23.950 --> 02:26.631
...and the great thing about being a historian of the English language...

02:26.710 --> 02:28.763
....is that I get to call this "research."

02:30.454 --> 02:32.914
When I teach the history of the English language,...

02:33.024 --> 02:38.337
...I require that students teach me two new slang words before I will begin class.

02:39.188 --> 02:43.063
Over the years, I have learned some great new slang this way,..

02:44.580 --> 02:56.195
...including "hangry," which is when you are cranky or angry because you are hungry,...

02:59.031 --> 03:07.162
....and "adorkable," which is when you are adorable in kind of a dorky way.
