In examining the spleen, unlike the liver, the spleen I think is a tricky organ to percuss.

00:11.364 --> 00:15.757
The spleen enlarges in this direction towards the right lower quadrant.

00:15.837 --> 00:20.119
And it's very embarrassing to miss a spleen because you started so high.

00:20.641 --> 00:24.582
So, I would suggest starting over here in the right lower quadrant...

00:25.015 --> 00:26.054
...and working your way up.

00:26.407 --> 00:29.571
The most important dictum though in examining the spleen is...

00:29.883 --> 00:34.624
...to let the spleen palpate your fingers and not the other way around.

00:34.708 --> 00:39.145
So, once you get your hands set, have the patient take a deep breath.

00:40.895 --> 00:42.010
Would you take a deep breath?

00:43.604 --> 00:48.003
And when he breathes out, I take up my next position.

00:48.245 --> 00:48.844
Deep breath.

00:50.974 --> 00:51.755
Out.

00:53.247 --> 00:58.161
And this way, if the spleen is there and your fingers are not moving,...

00:58.509 --> 01:01.804
...you have a good chance of it coming and brushing your fingers.

01:02.245 --> 01:04.899
My suggestion is, begin in the right lower quadrant.

01:05.461 --> 01:10.259
Once you get your fingers in position, have the patient's diaphragm do the work for you.

01:10.800 --> 01:14.422
Let the spleen palpate your fingers and not the other way around.

01:14.564 --> 01:16.795
Don't dig, because there is no gold.
