So, in our approach to a patient with multiple rashes...

00:03.110 --> 00:06.119
...it is important for us to examine certain body parts...

00:06.191 --> 00:08.095
...that may give us clues to the diagnosis.

00:08.602 --> 00:12.579
So, one example is to make sure we look at the nails and examine the nails of our patient...

00:12.679 --> 00:16.110
...to look for any hints that could signify certain diseases.

00:16.963 --> 00:19.138
Ma'am, is it okay if I take a look at your elbows?

00:23.089 --> 00:24.617
We also want to examine her scalp.

00:33.743 --> 00:37.753
In this patient with multiple rashes with a known diagnosis of psoriasis...

00:37.816 --> 00:42.152
...and with some clinical lesions, classic for psoriasis on her elbows and scalp,...

00:42.511 --> 00:47.287
...it can be difficult to understand whether or not other rashes are related to that same diagnosis.

00:47.769 --> 00:52.307
To recap, we see multiple diagnoses and we need to approach each one independently...

00:52.433 --> 00:54.012
...as if they are the only rash.

00:54.641 --> 00:57.089
You'll often have patients with multiple and complex rashes.

00:57.529 --> 00:59.318
These rashes don't need to be confusing.

00:59.619 --> 01:01.861
You just need to approach each rash one at a time...

01:01.945 --> 01:04.922
...by describing primary morphology and supportive attributes.
