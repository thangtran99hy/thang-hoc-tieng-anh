Today, we're going to be talking about how to approach a patient with a facial rash.

00:05.359 --> 00:11.366
So, in summary, acne and rosacea are both chronic inflammatory diseases that are very common...

00:11.943 --> 00:14.215
...while acne presents with comedones,...

00:14.327 --> 00:18.023
...rosacea presents more with papules and pustules without comedones.

00:18.855 --> 00:24.177
Rosacea also tends to affect the central face, the flush areas of the skin...

00:24.646 --> 00:27.207
...while acne can be much more widespread.

00:27.978 --> 00:30.568
Rosacea tends to come episodically...

00:30.978 --> 00:40.409
...and common triggers include things like sun, heat, strong emotions, alcohol, caffeine...

00:41.364 --> 00:43.080
...and spicy foods.
