00:00.291 --> 00:03.491
So in aortic regurgitation, there's a ton of clinical signs,...

00:03.893 --> 00:06.443
...mostly caused by the increased amount of blood flow...

00:06.517 --> 00:09.315
...going out and coming back in from the regurgitant murmur.

00:10.373 --> 00:14.869
One of those signs we've created here today essentially is taking the Corrigan's pulse.

00:18.305 --> 00:20.563
When you see that giant pulse going back and forth...

00:20.881 --> 00:23.473
...and creating it into an auditory version using a Doppler.

00:23.803 --> 00:26.463
So, all you simply do here, and I have Balfour here,...

00:26.547 --> 00:28.391
...who's going to help me demonstrate this.

00:28.677 --> 00:30.930
Balfour is going to show the contraction of the artery.

00:32.579 --> 00:35.249
You can see the contractions of the artery using the stick here.

00:35.970 --> 00:38.897
And then we'll go ahead and put the Doppler over his other carotid artery.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.043
So, essentially what we're doing here is taking a Doppler,...

00:46.257 --> 00:49.790
...placing it over the carotid artery and tilting it downward a little bit.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.129
After you hear the systolic component,...

00:52.336 --> 00:55.747
...you hear a diastolic reflux of blood flow back towards the heart.
