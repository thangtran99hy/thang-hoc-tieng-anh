The world at night is beautiful.

00:03.279 --> 00:06.013
But it also tells a story of energy poverty.

00:06.339 --> 00:08.175
Almost a billion people live here in Europe...

00:08.923 --> 00:11.771
...nearly everyone has access to electricity.

00:12.412 --> 00:15.233
A billion people live here in this part of Africa...

00:15.981 --> 00:18.349
...only half have access to electricity.

00:19.719 --> 00:22.415
There is no question that reliable electricity...

00:22.535 --> 00:24.246
...unlocks a better life for people.

00:25.263 --> 00:27.644
With electricity, food can be kept from spoiling.

00:28.619 --> 00:31.258
Vaccines can be kept at a safe temperature.

00:32.068 --> 00:35.067
Lights at night let people read and do homework.

00:36.543 --> 00:39.566
Electricity powers businesses and creates jobs.

00:40.353 --> 00:42.644
The world would become a richer, healthier,...

00:42.837 --> 00:47.722
...and more equitable place if everyone had reliable access to electricity.

00:49.221 --> 00:51.826
Right now the most effective way to create this access...

00:51.969 --> 00:54.872
...is to build traditional electric generating plants...

00:55.219 --> 00:56.789
...that burn fossil fuels.

00:57.553 --> 01:00.626
Electricity generation creates 25 percent...

01:00.780 --> 01:03.061
...of planet warming greenhouse gas emissions.

01:03.616 --> 01:07.093
What's needed are affordable ways to bring clean energy...

01:07.257 --> 01:08.759
...to nearly a billion people...

01:08.875 --> 01:11.486
...who deserve more access to electricity.

01:11.807 --> 01:14.200
That's why I'm making investments in clean,...

01:14.456 --> 01:17.640
...affordable, and reliable ways to generate electricity...

01:17.907 --> 01:20.151
...and I'm encouraging others to do the same.
