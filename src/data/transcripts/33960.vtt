Up until now, our communication with machines has always been limited to conscious and direct forms.

00:22.678 --> 00:25.795
Whether it's something simple like turning on the lights with a switch,...

00:26.257 --> 00:29.034
...or even as complex as programming robotics,...

00:29.590 --> 00:34.129
...we have always had to give a command to a machine, or even a series of commands,...

00:34.231 --> 00:36.070
...in order for it to do something for us.

00:36.904 --> 00:39.085
Communication between people, on the other hand,...

00:39.371 --> 00:42.322
...is far more complex and a lot more interesting...

00:42.596 --> 00:46.643
...because we take into account so much more than what is explicitly expressed.

00:47.283 --> 00:50.203
We observe facial expressions, body language,...

00:50.495 --> 00:54.386
...and we can intuit feelings and emotions from our dialogue with one another.

00:55.285 --> 00:58.362
This actually forms a large part of our decision-making process.

00:59.760 --> 01:03.867
Our vision is to introduce this whole new realm of human interaction...

01:04.281 --> 01:08.193
...into human-computer interaction so that computers can understand...

01:08.544 --> 01:10.309
...not only what you direct it to do,...

01:10.673 --> 01:15.548
...but it can also respond to your facial expressions and emotional experiences.

01:16.323 --> 01:19.773
And what better way to do this than by interpreting the signals...

01:19.881 --> 01:24.287
...naturally produced by our brain, our center for control and experience.

01:25.392 --> 01:29.391
Well, it sounds like a pretty good idea, but this task, as Bruno mentioned,...

01:29.513 --> 01:35.023
...isn't an easy one for two main reasons: First, the detection algorithms.

01:35.796 --> 01:38.911
Our brain is made up of billions of active neurons,...

01:39.143 --> 01:43.419
...around 170,000 kilometers of combined axon length.

01:44.179 --> 01:45.804
When these neurons interact,...

01:46.150 --> 01:49.719
...the chemical reaction emits an electrical impulse, which can be measured.

01:50.785 --> 01:56.624
The majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain,...

01:57.034 --> 02:00.245
...and to increase the area that's available for mental capacity,...

02:00.687 --> 02:02.873
...the brain surface is highly folded.

02:03.465 --> 02:06.891
Now, this cortical folding presents a significant challenge...

02:06.968 --> 02:09.989
...for interpreting surface electrical impulses.

02:10.727 --> 02:16.073
Each individual's cortex is folded differently, very much like a fingerprint.

02:16.671 --> 02:20.422
So even though a signal may come from the same functional part of the brain,...

02:20.896 --> 02:22.845
...by the time the structure has been folded,...

02:23.257 --> 02:28.705
...its physical location is very different between individuals, even identical twins.

02:29.997 --> 02:33.211
There is no longer any consistency in the surface signals.

02:34.063 --> 02:38.397
Our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex,...

02:38.624 --> 02:41.611
... so that we can map the signals closer to its source,...

02:41.936 --> 02:45.389
...and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population.

02:46.692 --> 02:51.515
The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves.

02:51.706 --> 02:56.021
EEG measurements typically involve a hairnet with an array of sensors,...

02:56.379 --> 02:58.545
...like the one that you can see here in the photo.
