00:12.785 --> 00:17.082
These dragons from deep time are incredible creatures.

00:17.507 --> 00:22.734
They're bizarre, they're beautiful, and there's very little we know about them.

00:23.579 --> 00:29.333
These thoughts were going through my head when I looked at the pages of my first dinosaur book.

00:30.349 --> 00:32.089
I was about five years old at the time,...

00:32.909 --> 00:37.037
...and I decided there and then  that I would become a paleontologist.

00:37.648 --> 00:40.869
Paleontology allowed me to combine my love for animals...

00:41.233 --> 00:44.503
...with my desire to travel to far-flung corners of the world.

00:45.611 --> 00:46.864
And now, a few years later,...

00:47.189 --> 00:52.661
...I've led several expeditions to the ultimate far-flung corner on this planet, the Sahara.

00:54.493 --> 00:55.719
I've worked in the Sahara...

00:56.047 --> 00:59.559
...because I've been on a quest to uncover new remains...

01:00.224 --> 01:04.288
...of a bizarre, giant predatory dinosaur called Spinosaurus.

01:06.157 --> 01:10.701
A few bones of this animal have been found in the deserts of Egypt...

01:10.977 --> 01:15.478
...and were described about 100 years ago by a German paleontologist.

01:16.801 --> 01:20.470
Unfortunately, all his Spinosaurus bones were destroyed in World War II,...

01:21.257 --> 01:24.961
...so all we're left with are just a few drawings and notes.

01:25.833 --> 01:28.048
From these drawings, we know that this creature,...

01:28.249 --> 01:31.193
...which lived about 100 million years ago, was very big.

01:31.612 --> 01:35.097
It had tall spines on its back, forming a magnificent sail,...

01:36.086 --> 01:43.434
...and it had long, slender jaws, a bit like a crocodile, with conical teeth,...

01:44.094 --> 01:48.097
...that may have been used to catch slippery prey, like fish.

01:48.419 --> 01:53.326
But that was pretty much all we knew about this animal for the next 100 years.

01:58.641 --> 02:02.486
My fieldwork took me to the border region between Morocco and Algeria,..

02:03.443 --> 02:04.815
...a place called the Kem Kem.

02:05.613 --> 02:07.171
It's a difficult place to work in.

02:08.019 --> 02:11.057
You have to deal with sandstorms and snakes and scorpions,...

02:11.769 --> 02:14.217
...and it's very difficult to find good fossils there.

02:14.859 --> 02:16.386
But our hard work paid off.

02:17.563 --> 02:20.451
We discovered many incredible specimens.

02:20.741 --> 02:23.948
There's the largest dinosaur bone that had ever been found in this part of the Sahara.

02:25.121 --> 02:27.956
We found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs,...

02:28.767 --> 02:30.625
...medium-sized predatory dinosaurs...

02:31.452 --> 02:35.925
...and seven or eight different kinds of crocodile-like hunters.

02:36.903 --> 02:39.043
These fossils were deposited in a river system.

02:39.999 --> 02:47.161
The river system was also home to a giant, car-sized coelacanth, a monster sawfish,...

02:47.712 --> 02:52.800
...and the skies over the river system were filled with pterosaurs, flying reptiles.

02:53.584 --> 02:54.841
It was a pretty dangerous place,...

02:54.935 --> 02:57.960
...not the kind of place where you'd want to travel to if you had a time machine.
