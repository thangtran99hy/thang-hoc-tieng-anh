Our emotions influence every aspect of our lives, from our health and how we learn,...

00:17.940 --> 00:21.297
...to how we do business and make decisions, big ones and small.

00:22.566 --> 00:25.922
Our emotions also influence how we connect with one another.

00:27.073 --> 00:30.216
We've evolved to live in a world like this,...

00:31.073 --> 00:35.255
...but instead, we're living more and more of our lives like this.

00:35.343 --> 00:37.487
This is the text message from my daughter last night,...

00:38.968 --> 00:40.886
...in a world that's devoid of emotion.

00:41.317 --> 00:43.073
So I'm on a mission to change that.

00:43.216 --> 00:46.799
I want to bring emotions back into our digital experiences.

00:48.393 --> 00:50.711
I started on this path 15 years ago.

00:50.883 --> 00:53.355
I was a computer scientist in Egypt,...

00:53.421 --> 00:57.112
...and I had just gotten accepted to a Ph.D. program at Cambridge University.

00:57.937 --> 01:03.479
So I did something quite unusual for a young newlywed Muslim Egyptian wife.

01:05.793 --> 01:08.426
With the support of my husband, who had to stay in Egypt,...

01:08.533 --> 01:10.839
...I packed my bags and I moved to England.

01:11.501 --> 01:14.460
At Cambridge, thousands of miles away from home,...

01:14.795 --> 01:19.553
...I realized I was spending more hours with my laptop than I did with any other human.

01:20.472 --> 01:25.059
Yet, despite this intimacy, my laptop had absolutely no idea how I was feeling.

01:25.379 --> 01:31.492
It had no idea if I was happy, having a bad day, or stressed, confused,...

01:31.572 --> 01:33.141
...and so, that got frustrating.

01:35.427 --> 01:39.408
Even worse, as I communicated online with my family back home,...

01:41.199 --> 01:44.110
...I felt that all my emotions disappeared in cyberspace.

01:44.728 --> 01:49.402
I was homesick, I was lonely, and on some days I was actually crying,...

01:49.860 --> 01:54.343
...but all I had to communicate these emotions was this.

01:56.785 --> 02:02.507
Today's technology has lots of IQ but no EQ; lots of cognitive intelligence...

02:02.615 --> 02:04.376
...but no emotional intelligence.

02:05.068 --> 02:10.969
So that got me thinking, what if our technology could sense our emotions?

02:11.083 --> 02:14.523
What if our devices could sense how we felt and reacted accordingly,...

02:14.893 --> 02:17.455
...just the way an emotionally intelligent friend would?
