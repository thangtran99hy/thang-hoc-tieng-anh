I've spent nearly two decades observing what makes people luckier than others...

00:18.691 --> 00:22.173
...and trying to help people increase their luck.

00:22.761 --> 00:28.778
You see, I teach entrepreneurship, and we all know that most new ventures fail,...

00:29.336 --> 00:33.004
...and innovators and entrepreneurs need all the luck they can get.

00:34.007 --> 00:34.935
So what is luck?

00:35.333 --> 00:41.283
Luck is defined as success or failure apparently caused by chance.

00:42.453 --> 00:43.379
Apparently.

00:43.793 --> 00:45.438
That's the operative word.

00:46.519 --> 00:48.423
It looks like it's chance...

00:48.541 --> 00:52.978
...because we rarely see all the levers that come into play to make people lucky.

00:53.628 --> 00:56.391
But I've realized, by watching so long,...

00:56.731 --> 01:01.806
...that luck is rarely a lightning strike, isolated and dramatic.

01:02.416 --> 01:05.998
It's much more like the wind, blowing constantly.

01:06.442 --> 01:09.676
Sometimes it's calm, and sometimes it blows in gusts...

01:10.396 --> 01:13.060
...and sometimes it comes from directions that you didn't even imagine.

01:14.245 --> 01:16.817
So how do you catch the winds of luck?

01:17.662 --> 01:20.230
It's easy, but it's not obvious.

01:20.847 --> 01:24.625
So I'm going to share three things with you that you can do...

01:25.551 --> 01:28.829
...to build a sail to capture the winds of luck.

01:29.749 --> 01:33.548
The first thing you want to do is to change your relationship with yourself.

01:34.047 --> 01:37.534
Be willing to take small risks that get you out of your comfort zone.

01:38.226 --> 01:41.525
Now, when we're children, we do this all the time.

01:42.509 --> 01:44.913
We have to do this if we're going to learn how to walk...

01:45.013 --> 01:48.409
...or talk or ride a bike or even quantum mechanics.

01:48.500 --> 01:48.762
Right?

01:49.000 --> 01:53.403
We need to go from someone one week who doesn't ride a bike to, next week, someone who does.

01:53.756 --> 01:57.468
And this requires us to get out of our comfort zone and take some risks.

01:58.119 --> 02:02.095
The problem is, as we get older, we rarely do this.

02:02.219 --> 02:05.745
We sort of lock down the sense of who we are and don't stretch anymore.

02:06.345 --> 02:10.573
Now, with my students, I spend a lot of time giving them encouragement...

02:10.865 --> 02:13.171
...to get out of their comfort zone and take some risks.

02:13.975 --> 02:14.695
How do I do this?

02:14.971 --> 02:18.673
Well, I start out by having them fill out a risk-o-meter.

02:19.045 --> 02:21.705
Now, it's basically a fun thing we developed in our class...

02:21.801 --> 02:24.497
...where they map out what risks they're willing to take.

02:24.860 --> 02:29.857
And it becomes clear very quickly to them that risk-taking is not binary.

02:30.398 --> 02:32.653
There are intellectual risks and physical risks...

02:32.845 --> 02:37.219
...and financial risks and emotional risks and social risks and ethical risks and political risks.

02:38.069 --> 02:41.543
And once they do this, they compare their risk profiles with others,...

02:41.913 --> 02:45.123
...and they quickly realize that they're all really different.

02:46.155 --> 02:51.325
I then encourage them to stretch, to take some risks that get them out of their comfort zone.

02:51.458 --> 02:54.727
For example, I might ask them to do an intellectual risk...

02:55.012 --> 02:57.494
...and try to tackle a problem they haven't tried before;...

02:58.077 --> 03:01.856
...or a social risk, talking to someone sitting next to them on the train;...

03:02.621 --> 03:06.895
...or an emotional risk, maybe telling someone they really care about how they feel.
