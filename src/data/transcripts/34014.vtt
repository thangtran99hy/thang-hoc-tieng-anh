00:00.710 --> 00:03.133
I do this myself all the time.

00:03.657 --> 00:08.482
About a dozen years ago, I was on an airplane, early, early morning flight on my way to Ecuador.

00:08.849 --> 00:16.304
And normally, I'd just put on my headphones and go to sleep, wake up, do some work,...

00:16.443 --> 00:17.914
...but I decided to take a little risk,...

00:18.422 --> 00:20.839
...and I started a conversation with the man sitting next to me.

00:20.981 --> 00:24.327
I introduced myself, and I'd learned that he was a publisher.

00:26.115 --> 00:26.781
Interesting.

00:27.006 --> 00:28.546
We ended up having a fascinating conversation.

00:28.630 --> 00:31.466
I learned all about the future of the publishing industry.

00:32.230 --> 00:37.095
So about three quarters of the way through the flight, I decided to take another risk,...

00:37.470 --> 00:38.635
...and I opened up my laptop...

00:38.721 --> 00:44.917
...and I shared with him a book proposal I put together for something I was doing in my class.

00:45.336 --> 00:47.338
And he was very polite, he read it, and he said,...

00:47.407 --> 00:49.533
..."You know what, Tina, this isn't right for us,...

00:49.615 --> 00:50.789
...but thank you so much for sharing."

00:51.117 --> 00:51.583
It's OK.

00:51.903 --> 00:53.103
That risk didn't work out.

00:54.193 --> 00:55.099
I shut my laptop.

00:55.376 --> 00:58.421
At the end of the flight, we exchanged contact information.

00:59.966 --> 01:02.049
A couple of months later, I reached out to him,...

01:02.441 --> 01:04.545
...and I said, "Mark, would you like to come to my class?

01:04.621 --> 01:08.849
I'm doing a project on reinventing the book, the future of publishing."

01:08.933 --> 01:10.353
And he said, "Great. I'd love to come."

01:10.511 --> 01:11.410
So he came to my class.

01:11.509 --> 01:12.662
We had a great experience.

01:13.529 --> 01:15.240
A few months later, I wrote to him again.

01:15.584 --> 01:20.401
This time, I sent him a bunch of video clips from another project my students had done.

01:21.335 --> 01:25.679
He was so intrigued by one of the projects the students had done,..

01:26.051 --> 01:29.935
...he thought there might be a book in it, and he wanted to meet those students.

01:30.649 --> 01:32.389
Now, I have to tell you, I was a little bit hurt, right?

01:33.439 --> 01:37.427
I mean, he wanted to do a book with my students and not with me, but OK, it's all right.

01:37.836 --> 01:41.020
So I invited him to come down, and he and his colleagues came to Stanford...

01:41.643 --> 01:45.037
...and met with the students, and afterwards, we had lunch together.

01:45.947 --> 01:50.452
And one of his editors said to me, "Hey, have you ever considered writing a book?"

01:51.315 --> 01:52.888
I said, "Funny you should ask."

01:53.171 --> 01:59.069
And I pulled out the exact same proposal that I had showed his boss a year earlier.

01:59.718 --> 02:01.789
Within two weeks, I had a contract,...

02:02.089 --> 02:05.733
...and within two years, the book had sold over a million copies around the world.

02:08.585 --> 02:11.796
Now, you might say, "Oh, you're so lucky."

02:12.064 --> 02:17.421
But of course I was lucky, but that luck resulted from a series of small risks I took,...

02:17.629 --> 02:19.473
...starting with saying hello.

02:20.033 --> 02:23.822
And anyone can do this, no matter where you are in your life,...

02:24.206 --> 02:29.104
...no matter where you are in the world, no matter ... even if you think you're the most unlucky person,...

02:29.447 --> 02:33.306
...you can do this by taking little risks that get you out of your comfort zone.

02:33.548 --> 02:36.059
You start building a sail to capture luck.
