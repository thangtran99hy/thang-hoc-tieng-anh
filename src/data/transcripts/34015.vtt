The second thing you want to do is to change your relationship with other people.

00:04.897 --> 00:07.775
You need to understand that everyone...

00:08.027 --> 00:13.700
...who helps you on your journey is playing a huge role in getting you to your goals.

00:14.175 --> 00:18.881
And if you don't show appreciation, not only are you not closing the loop,...

00:19.099 --> 00:20.516
...but you're missing an opportunity.

00:22.095 --> 00:23.934
When someone does something for you,...

00:24.235 --> 00:28.207
...they're taking that time that they could be spending on themselves or someone else,...

00:28.717 --> 00:30.707
...and you need to acknowledge what they're doing.

00:32.231 --> 00:36.151
Now, I run three fellowship programs at Stanford,...

00:36.562 --> 00:38.347
...and they are very competitive to get into,...

00:38.489 --> 00:41.227
...and when I send out the letters to those students who don't get in,...

00:41.584 --> 00:43.868
...I always know there are going to be people who are disappointed.

00:44.610 --> 00:47.733
Some of the people who are disappointed send me notes, complaining.

00:48.193 --> 00:52.525
Some of them send notes saying what could I do to make myself more successful next time around?

00:53.029 --> 00:57.911
And every once in a while, someone sends me a note thanking me for the opportunity.

00:58.673 --> 01:00.239
This happened about seven years ago.

01:00.334 --> 01:02.857
A young man named Brian sent me a beautiful note saying,...

01:03.079 --> 01:06.062
..."I know I've been rejected from this program twice,...

01:06.482 --> 01:08.391
...but I want to thank you for the opportunity.

01:08.471 --> 01:11.151
I learned so much through the process of applying."

01:11.943 --> 01:17.397
I was so taken by the graciousness of his message that I invited him to come and meet me.

01:18.013 --> 01:22.753
And we spent some time chatting and cooked up an idea for an independent study project together.

01:23.807 --> 01:25.509
He was on the football team at Stanford,...

01:25.645 --> 01:29.687
...and he decided to do a project on looking at leadership in that context.

01:30.108 --> 01:33.427
We got to know each other incredibly well through that quarter,...

01:33.796 --> 01:37.192
...and he took the project that he started working on in the independent study...

01:37.544 --> 01:41.567
...and turned it, ultimately, into a company called Play for Tomorrow,....

01:42.056 --> 01:44.799
...where he teaches kids from disadvantaged backgrounds...

01:45.066 --> 01:47.785
...how to, essentially, craft the lives they dream to live.
