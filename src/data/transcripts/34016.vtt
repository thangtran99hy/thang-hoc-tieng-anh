00:00.265 --> 00:02.466
Now, the important thing about this story...

00:03.133 --> 00:05.942
...is that we both ended up catching the winds of luck...

00:06.291 --> 00:07.970
...as a result of his thank you note.

00:08.510 --> 00:12.009
But it was the winds that we didn't expect in the first place.

00:13.274 --> 00:15.081
Over the course of the last couple of years,...

00:15.238 --> 00:20.669
...I've come up with some tactics for my own life to help me really foster appreciation.

00:21.231 --> 00:24.369
My favorite is that at the end of every single day,...

00:24.798 --> 00:28.282
...I look at my calendar and I review all the people I met with,...

00:28.583 --> 00:30.990
...and I send thank you notes to every single person.

00:31.659 --> 00:35.301
It only takes a few minutes, but at the end of every day,...

00:35.671 --> 00:41.269
...I feel incredibly grateful and appreciative, and I promise you it has increased my luck.

00:42.345 --> 00:45.491
So first, you need to take some risks and get out of your comfort zone.

00:45.951 --> 00:47.992
Second, you need to show appreciation.

00:48.436 --> 00:52.191
And third, you want to change your relationship with ideas.

00:53.357 --> 00:56.389
Most people look at new ideas that come their way and they judge them.

00:56.479 --> 00:58.913
"That's a great idea" or "That's a terrible idea."

00:59.408 --> 01:02.454
But it's actually much more nuanced.

01:03.137 --> 01:04.781
Ideas are neither good nor bad.

01:05.039 --> 01:09.877
And in fact, the seeds of terrible ideas are often something truly remarkable.

01:11.087 --> 01:15.231
One of my favorite exercises in my classes on creativity is to help students...

01:15.324 --> 01:21.555
...foster an attitude of looking at terrible ideas through the lens of possibilities.

01:22.333 --> 01:27.736
So I give them a challenge: to create an idea for a brand new restaurant.

01:28.197 --> 01:30.602
They have to come up with the best ideas for a new restaurant...

01:30.964 --> 01:33.174
...and the worst ideas for a new restaurant.

01:33.814 --> 01:38.423
So the best ideas are things like a restaurant on a mountaintop with a beautiful sunset,...

01:38.721 --> 01:41.299
...or a restaurant on a boat with a gorgeous view.

01:41.685 --> 01:46.052
And the terrible ideas are things like a restaurant in a garbage dump,...

01:46.485 --> 01:50.318
...or a restaurant with terrible service that's really dirty,...

01:50.773 --> 01:53.508
...or a restaurant that serves cockroach sushi.

01:55.607 --> 01:59.646
So they hand all the ideas to me, I read the great ideas out loud,...

01:59.961 --> 02:01.989
...and then I rip them up and throw them away.

02:03.465 --> 02:06.641
I then take the horrible ideas and redistribute them.

02:07.248 --> 02:11.446
Each team now has an idea that another team thought was horrible,...

02:11.867 --> 02:14.679
...and their challenge is to turn it into something brilliant.
