00:00.233 --> 00:01.119
Here's what happens.

00:02.057 --> 00:06.348
Within about 10 seconds, someone says, "This is a fabulous idea."

00:06.976 --> 00:11.311
And they have about three minutes before they pitch the idea to the class.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.735
So the restaurant in the garbage dump?

00:13.953 --> 00:14.840
What does that turn into?

00:15.023 --> 00:19.006
Well, they collect all the food from Michelin star restaurants...

00:19.085 --> 00:21.097
...that was going to get thrown out all the extra food.

00:21.429 --> 00:24.677
...and they have another restaurant at a much lower price, with all the leftovers.

00:25.065 --> 00:25.617
Pretty cool?

00:26.037 --> 00:29.000
Or the restaurant that's dirty with terrible service?

00:29.823 --> 00:35.206
Well, that turns into a restaurant that's a training ground for future restaurateurs...

00:35.281 --> 00:37.621
...to figure out how to avoid all the pitfalls.

00:38.399 --> 00:40.138
And the restaurant with cockroach sushi?

00:40.385 --> 00:42.325
Well, of course, it turns into a sushi bar...

00:42.577 --> 00:45.627
...with all sorts of really interesting and exotic ingredients.

00:47.037 --> 00:52.945
If you look around at the companies, the ventures that are really innovative around you,...

00:53.231 --> 00:56.413
...the ones that we now take for granted that have changed our life,...

00:56.905 --> 00:57.745
...well, you know what?

00:58.171 --> 01:00.619
They all started out as crazy ideas.

01:01.013 --> 01:03.402
They started ideas that when they pitched to other people,...

01:03.637 --> 01:06.902
...most people said, "That's crazy, it will never work."

01:09.331 --> 01:14.647
So, yes, sometimes people were born into terrible circumstances,...

01:15.009 --> 01:17.101
...and sometimes, luck is a lightning bolt...

01:17.363 --> 01:20.045
...that hits us with something wonderful or something terrible.

01:21.175 --> 01:27.667
But the winds of luck are always there, and if you're willing to take some risks,...

01:28.255 --> 01:31.493
...if you're willing to really go out and show appreciation...

01:31.800 --> 01:37.569
..and willing to really look at ideas, even if they're crazy, through the lens of possibilities,...

01:38.030 --> 01:42.309
...you build a bigger and bigger sail to catch the winds of luck.

01:42.860 --> 01:43.211
Thank you.
