Winchester Mystery House is an incredibly unique Victorian mansion...

00:05.509 --> 00:09.652
...created by Sarah Winchester, heiress to the Winchester Repeating Arms fortune.

00:10.193 --> 00:14.272
Sarah Winchester had a series of unfortunate things happen to her,...

00:14.528 --> 00:16.959
...including the death of her husband and daughter.

00:17.873 --> 00:22.785
She was a spiritualist and visited a medium to try and understand why.

00:23.494 --> 00:25.558
The medium said, well, "The gun that won the West."

00:25.685 --> 00:30.389
There's a lot of karma there, so head west and build a house to appease the spirits.

00:30.944 --> 00:35.431
She started construction in 1884, which didn't stop till the day she died.

00:36.355 --> 00:40.853
The house is a 160-room Victorian mansion with no master plan.

00:41.107 --> 00:42.898
There's a lot of strange attributes.

00:43.708 --> 00:48.309
There are 40 staircases, 40 fireplaces, four elevators.

00:48.765 --> 00:51.507
We have a number of staircases that lead right to the ceiling,...

00:52.032 --> 00:55.307
...doors that open up into nothing, or it's just a wall.

00:56.269 --> 01:00.958
The house is known for its spirits, who many people believe are the ghosts of people...

01:01.071 --> 01:04.211
...who worked at the house or even Sarah herself.

01:04.890 --> 01:09.895
A lot of our guests and employees have had very strange things happen to them in this house.

01:10.151 --> 01:13.003
Sometimes, it's just footsteps or hearing a voice,...

01:13.941 --> 01:19.347
...a light that flickers, or sometimes it's an actual full, physical manifestation.
