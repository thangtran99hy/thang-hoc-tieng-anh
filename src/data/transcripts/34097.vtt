Here's a scientific mystery for you.

00:06.777 --> 00:09.478
Does hot water freeze faster than cold water?

00:09.581 --> 00:10.390
The answer is...

00:10.854 --> 00:11.840
We don't know.

00:11.937 --> 00:13.917
You're probably thinking, how can we not know?

00:13.996 --> 00:15.280
I mean, we've all got water.

00:15.427 --> 00:16.388
Most of us have a freezer.

00:16.485 --> 00:17.921
This seems like a pretty simple experiment.

00:18.034 --> 00:19.968
Well you're right, it is, it also isn't.

00:20.111 --> 00:21.571
The experiment has been performed...

00:21.700 --> 00:23.471
...by brilliant people all over the world.

00:23.666 --> 00:24.763
And in those experiments,...

00:25.061 --> 00:27.902
...sometimes hot water freezes faster than cold water.

00:28.037 --> 00:29.967
And sometimes it doesn't.

00:30.143 --> 00:32.803
And either way, the results of the experiment are not reproducible.

00:32.887 --> 00:35.161
The observation that hot water will freeze faster...

00:35.234 --> 00:37.477
...than cold water is called the Mpemba Effect.

00:37.583 --> 00:39.587
It's named after Erasto Mpemba,...

00:39.726 --> 00:41.521
...who noticed the effect in 1963...

00:41.603 --> 00:43.091
...when he was just thirteen years old...

00:43.366 --> 00:44.951
...and making ice cream with his classmates.

00:45.039 --> 00:46.249
He noticed that the ice cream mixture...

00:46.323 --> 00:48.071
...made with hot milk froze faster...

00:48.165 --> 00:49.250
...than the mixture made with cold milk.

00:49.456 --> 00:51.803
However, he wasnâ€™t the first person to make this claim.

00:52.231 --> 00:55.398
Aristotle said the same thing in the year 4 BCE.

00:55.545 --> 00:56.707
Just, you know, not about ice cream.

00:56.849 --> 00:59.087
Rene Descartes and Francis Bacon also believed...

00:59.181 --> 01:00.897
...that hot water froze faster than cold water.

01:01.047 --> 01:02.867
But scientists aren't convinced...

01:02.957 --> 01:04.951
...that the Mpemba Effect is actually a thing.
