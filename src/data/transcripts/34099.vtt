All my friends that come to stay here will stay at the house as long as we're all together.

00:09.330 --> 00:13.519
They all come and say things happen and stuff but, is there a ghost,...

00:13.747 --> 00:16.141
...yes, I've always known there's been a ghost here.

00:16.570 --> 00:18.292
And I do believe, it's Mrs. Carr.

00:20.492 --> 00:24.053
Mrs. Carr was the wife of the original owner, Charlie Carr...

00:24.366 --> 00:29.081
...and she was the lady that took care of this house and died in the ladies' parlor...

00:29.247 --> 00:30.848
...and was laid to rest there.

00:34.898 --> 00:40.580
I'll stay in the house with other people, but I actually don't wish to stay alone.

00:42.107 --> 00:46.913
With all of the sightings, I think that it's a warm spirit.

00:47.002 --> 00:48.820
There's nothing evil about it.

00:49.393 --> 00:54.521
She, having loved the house so much, is so happy...

00:54.725 --> 00:58.393
...that Tony is restoring this to its former glory.

00:58.911 --> 01:02.428
This house has just got so much feeling to it.

01:02.921 --> 01:08.176
Actually, I think every house speaks and has its own story.

01:08.639 --> 01:11.989
And this one has got a good story and a good ending.
