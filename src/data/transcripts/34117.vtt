The reasons US cars are so rare in Japan, which is the world's third-largest car market,...

00:06.111 --> 00:09.113
...have more to do with Japanese consumer tastes,...

00:09.224 --> 00:14.567
...the abiding if outdated stereotypes the Japanese have about the quality of American cars,...

00:14.732 --> 00:18.871
...and the very different way customers shop for vehicles in Japan.

00:19.462 --> 00:24.643
It is first important to note that Japanese brands all but completely dominate local roads.

00:24.879 --> 00:29.707
More than 95 percent of all cars sold in the country are Japanese.

00:29.888 --> 00:35.983
Imports make up the balance and most of those are higher-end European luxury vehicles and sports cars.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.286
This is partly because the Japanese have pretty specific needs.

00:39.495 --> 00:42.305
For one thing, space is incredibly tight.

00:42.704 --> 00:46.050
Wildly popular in Japan are these so-called kei cars,...

00:46.146 --> 00:48.478
...which are tiny vehicles preferred by drivers...

00:48.556 --> 00:51.711
...who have to thread their way through narrow streets and crowded cities.

00:51.881 --> 00:57.307
Kei cars alone make up 40 percent of the Japanese market and US automakers don't make them.
