Today, we are going to explore some Japanese history and tradition.

00:05.303 --> 00:09.524
We're going to make Japanese sweets, dress in a traditional kimono...

00:09.801 --> 00:13.884
...and be taken through the steps of a Japanese tea ceremony.

00:20.297 --> 00:24.425
Kimono is basically made of just one fabric.

00:24.842 --> 00:28.606
There's a very important art to dressing in the kimono,...

00:28.707 --> 00:31.654
...so they're going to teach us how to get dressed.

00:32.565 --> 00:34.729
All right, make it nice and snug.

00:35.783 --> 00:37.543
Now that we're fully dressed in our kimono,...

00:37.628 --> 00:39.692
...it's time to head up for the tea ceremony.

00:42.322 --> 00:44.146
Welcome to Nagoya.

00:44.585 --> 00:46.865
Tea ceremonies started in the 1600s.

00:47.102 --> 00:51.212
It's the combination of Shintoism and also the Zen,...

00:51.484 --> 00:54.096
...which is related to harmony and transience.

00:58.799 --> 01:01.153
Wow, that's beautiful.

01:01.440 --> 01:04.658
There are plenty of opportunities to take photos throughout the place...

01:04.799 --> 01:08.445
...and even dress up as a samurai warrior.

01:11.883 --> 01:15.954
Now it's time to learn how to make some Japanese sweets.

01:17.500 --> 01:21.625
I think the thing I like most about the Japanese way of doing things...

01:21.759 --> 01:25.015
...is simplicity can equal such beauty.

01:25.580 --> 01:26.133
How's that?

01:27.419 --> 01:28.473
Thank you!
