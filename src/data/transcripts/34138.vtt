Don't try this at home, kids!

00:07.491 --> 00:11.893
My first impression of Quebec City is that everyone is so warm and friendly.

00:12.195 --> 00:17.534
It's really welcoming, you know, from the United States, from New York City,...

00:17.843 --> 00:23.069
...people can be a bit cold at times, and here, everyone is so warm and friendly.

00:23.701 --> 00:26.766
Nina Pizza might be my favorite place so far,...

00:26.895 --> 00:29.580
...and the pizza was great; it was amazing.

00:31.948 --> 00:35.955
We went to the Dufferin Terrace toboggan slide and that was amazing.

00:36.083 --> 00:37.247
I felt like a little kid again.

00:40.201 --> 00:45.648
I never experienced going through any sort of large structure only made of ice.

00:45.898 --> 00:47.405
The museum was beautiful,...

00:48.329 --> 00:54.655
...and to hear about the history of art in Quebec especially in the 50s and 60s...

00:55.294 --> 00:59.671
...and some of that art that was being created with a rebellious spirit.

01:00.137 --> 01:04.607
I love snow and architecture and see the how the snow affects the city.

01:04.794 --> 01:06.377
It was just gorgeous.

01:06.461 --> 01:08.704
It was kind of sunny this morning and then boom!

01:09.738 --> 01:11.545
It's crazy; I don't feel like I'm five hours from New York.

01:11.642 --> 01:13.642
I really feel like I'm in Europe or something.

01:15.533 --> 01:19.717
Staying in Quebec City was such a delight and such a pleasant surprise,...

01:19.979 --> 01:21.046
...and I can't recommend it enough.

01:21.130 --> 01:22.655
I can't wait to come back and do it again.
