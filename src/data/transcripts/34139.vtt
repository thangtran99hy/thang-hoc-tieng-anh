00:03.099 --> 00:07.537
Football is played on a rectangular pitch marked out by touchlines and goal lines.

00:07.871 --> 00:10.429
Play starts with a kickoff from the center circle.

00:11.491 --> 00:15.200
A goal consists of two upright posts supporting a horizontal crossbar,...

00:15.669 --> 00:19.291
...lines on the pitch mark the goal area and the penalty box.

00:20.317 --> 00:24.062
Each side must have no more than 11 players on the pitch including a goalkeeper.

00:24.497 --> 00:26.342
Positions change according to tactics.

00:27.059 --> 00:30.637
To score a goal, the ball must cross the goal line inside the goalmouth.

00:30.987 --> 00:34.662
However, it can be disallowed if the scorer is offside when he receives the ball.

00:38.116 --> 00:41.478
A player is offside if he's close to the opponent's goal...

00:41.576 --> 00:44.015
...than both the ball and the second-last opponent.

00:44.976 --> 00:49.033
If a player kicks the ball out of play, a throw-in is taken by the opposing team.

00:51.996 --> 00:55.493
A corner kick is awarded when the ball crosses the opposition goal line...

00:55.773 --> 00:57.713
...after last touching one of their players.

00:58.062 --> 01:01.145
It's taken from the corner of whichever side the ball left the field.

01:01.976 --> 01:06.379
Free kicks are awarded to teams for fouls and misconduct outside the penalty area.

01:06.883 --> 01:09.185
They're taken from the spot where the offense occurred.

01:09.683 --> 01:13.487
Players from the opposing team often form a wall between the ball and the goal.

01:13.669 --> 01:15.733
If a foul occurs within the penalty area,...

01:15.935 --> 01:17.626
...the referee awards a penalty.

01:18.033 --> 01:22.758
The defending goalkeeper must remain on his goal line until the ball's been kicked.
