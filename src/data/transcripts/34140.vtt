00:00.601 --> 00:02.021
Ah, yes. Offside,...

00:02.633 --> 00:06.270
...taker-away of scoring chances and confuser of casual soccer fans everywhere.

00:06.857 --> 00:08.160
Is it frustrating at times?

00:08.355 --> 00:09.355
Yes, of course.

00:09.785 --> 00:11.623
But it's also an important, invaluable rule.

00:12.089 --> 00:15.579
Without offside, there'd be no need for perfectly-timed through balls and crosses,...

00:16.019 --> 00:19.173
...nor perfectly-timed runs combined with gravity-defying headers.

00:20.284 --> 00:23.075
The game would be mayhem, chaos, a catastrophe.

00:23.675 --> 00:25.017
So, what is offside?

00:25.536 --> 00:27.443
If the assistant referee raises his flag,...

00:27.535 --> 00:29.926
...it means that an offensive player was too far forward.

00:30.522 --> 00:33.399
According to FIFA, a player is in an offside position...

00:33.559 --> 00:37.951
...if he is nearer to his opponent's goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent.

00:39.204 --> 00:43.098
The key is realizing that offside is determined by when the ball is last touched.

00:46.240 --> 00:49.229
When Daley Blind hit his amazing ball over the Spanish defense,...

00:49.389 --> 00:53.140
...Robin van Persie was clearly onside, with two opponents between him and the goal.

00:53.526 --> 00:57.365
Only after the ball left Blind's foot did van Persie streak past the defense.
