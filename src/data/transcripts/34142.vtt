Climbing is one of the things that I do that gets me closest to myself...

00:12.202 --> 00:16.311
...where I really see my strength and my weaknesses.

00:17.002 --> 00:17.965
Am I scared?

00:18.247 --> 00:19.235
Am I not scared?

00:19.649 --> 00:21.216
Do I get distracted easily?

00:21.636 --> 00:23.067
How do I deal with pressure?

00:23.520 --> 00:24.898
Have I done my training?

00:25.175 --> 00:26.963
You really get to see your qualities...

00:27.057 --> 00:28.707
...very clearly when you're on your limit.

00:32.471 --> 00:35.019
My name is Rannveig Aamodt and I'm from Norway.

00:35.575 --> 00:40.149
I've been climbing for 19 years and home is now Colorado.

00:41.293 --> 00:44.769
Climbing for me is an outlet to really push myself.

00:45.041 --> 00:48.650
And I stay interested I think because it's so complex.

00:48.794 --> 00:50.765
It's always something you can get better at.

00:51.561 --> 00:56.070
My goal is to be as a diverse climber as possible.

00:56.643 --> 00:58.981
I really want to touch all types of climbing...

00:59.139 --> 01:02.824
...on as much different types of rocks and styles as possible.

01:03.253 --> 01:07.453
What I do think is important and what I'm gonna follow is my motivation...

01:07.622 --> 01:13.093
...because I think all things that you achieve, big things, come from this deep motivation.

01:13.289 --> 01:17.649
You're not always motivated about the things that you think you're gonna be.

01:18.189 --> 01:21.868
My goal is to listen to the motivation and then follow it.
