The incredible journey of life before birth.

00:04.001 --> 00:08.600
After three years in development, this was the moment the top secret work was unveiled.

00:09.883 --> 00:14.635
The former bad boy of British art, Damien Hirst built his reputation on controversy...

00:14.917 --> 00:18.879
...and was commissioned by the head of Qatar Museums Authority, Sheikha Mayassa.

00:19.149 --> 00:23.703
Fourteen huge sculptures that document the moment from conception to newborn.

00:24.219 --> 00:28.635
Sheikha Mayassa commissioned the bronze sculptures to go outside a medical research center.

00:28.851 --> 00:31.674
They're the centerpiece of a public campaign to get art...

00:31.795 --> 00:34.555
...and the debate it stimulates into the national psyche.

00:35.129 --> 00:39.466
It's to do with education in the sense of building a society...

00:40.971 --> 00:46.066
...that can be empowered for the future in the very long term beyond oil and gas,...

00:47.071 --> 00:48.647
That is a knowledge economy if you like.

00:48.774 --> 00:49.894
That sounds a little bit dry.

00:51.079 --> 00:59.171
Part of that is also about questioning about interacting with new ideas and new forms.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.580
And art is part of that.
