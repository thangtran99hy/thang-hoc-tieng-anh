00:00.287 --> 00:00.989
Hey, guys!

00:02.615 --> 00:03.737
Hey, how are you?

00:03.897 --> 00:04.607
Where are you heading to?

00:05.524 --> 00:06.478
We're going to Charlotte.

00:06.685 --> 00:08.610
Do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions?

00:09.037 --> 00:10.465
I won't take much of your time.

00:10.875 --> 00:11.205
Sure.

00:11.348 --> 00:12.264
Come on, sit down.

00:14.467 --> 00:16.995
Have you ever had the feeling that something was missing,...

00:17.665 --> 00:19.428
...like when you leave your house in the morning...

00:19.603 --> 00:21.361
...and you feel like there's something you're forgetting,...

00:22.319 --> 00:24.967
...that feeling that there's something more that you should be doing,...

00:25.737 --> 00:26.927
...somewhere else you should be?

00:28.007 --> 00:32.065
And you have to do something, but you never know exactly what?

00:33.201 --> 00:34.389
Have you ever felt that?

00:34.706 --> 00:35.256
Yeah.

00:35.444 --> 00:35.745
Yeah.

00:35.958 --> 00:36.739
Maybe.

00:37.021 --> 00:37.589
Yeah.

00:37.853 --> 00:42.155
If I told you there's a place where you will find the answers to these questions,...

00:42.753 --> 00:48.589
...where you will find yourself surrounded by mountains, jungles and the ocean,...

00:49.919 --> 00:51.633
...would you like to go?

00:52.427 --> 00:53.295
Yes.

00:53.414 --> 00:53.828
Okay.

00:53.984 --> 00:55.327
Of course!

00:56.552 --> 00:57.583
Open the suitcase.

00:57.731 --> 00:58.544
Are you kidding?

00:58.825 --> 01:00.029
Is this a joke?

01:00.150 --> 01:00.986
No.

01:01.263 --> 01:01.845
What?

01:02.602 --> 01:03.637
Congratulations!

01:04.009 --> 01:04.977
You're going to Peru!

01:05.401 --> 01:05.987
Seriously?

01:06.150 --> 01:07.303
I won a trip to Peru!

01:07.393 --> 01:07.907
Oh my god!
