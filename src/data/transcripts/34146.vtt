President Trump is changing Washington,...

00:02.377 --> 00:04.411
...creating six million new jobs,...

00:04.552 --> 00:06.867
...500,000 new manufacturing jobs,...

00:07.047 --> 00:09.315
...cutting illegal immigration in half.

00:09.411 --> 00:10.808
Obliterating ISIS,...

00:10.955 --> 00:12.233
...their caliphate destroyed,...

00:12.452 --> 00:14.459
...their terrorist leader, dead.

00:14.605 --> 00:18.571
But the Democrats would rather focus on impeachment and phony investigations,...

00:18.702 --> 00:20.257
...ignoring the real issues,...

00:20.407 --> 00:22.303
...but that's not stopping Donald Trump.

00:22.503 --> 00:27.277
He's no Mr. Nice Guy, but sometimes it takes a Donald Trump to change Washington.

00:27.642 --> 00:30.035
I'm Donald Trump and I approve this message.
