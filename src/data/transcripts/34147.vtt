00:00.661 --> 00:04.713
Being the fastest is, in my opinion, not the right expression.

00:05.955 --> 00:08.693
Moving boundaries might be the right expression.

00:08.905 --> 00:13.493
And right now, heading for the 300 mile barrier for a series hyper sports car,...

00:13.747 --> 00:16.741
...this is the boundary we were heading for.

00:16.965 --> 00:19.491
And this is what we'd like to achieve.

00:20.037 --> 00:24.277
The biggest challenge is to get the overall package right.

00:24.415 --> 00:29.024
So, that means not only design not only aerodynamics, not only engine, not only tires,...

00:29.083 --> 00:32.095
...is to get everything together and working in one car.

00:32.943 --> 00:37.815
At that kind of speed, normally airplanes are flying in the air.

00:38.539 --> 00:43.849
And you have to make sure that the car will stay on the ground, stable...

00:44.399 --> 00:46.178
...and not that nervous.

00:46.387 --> 00:48.689
That the driver feels comfortable in the car...

00:48.819 --> 00:53.466
...and that you can drive that kind of speed without any risk.

00:54.819 --> 00:56.309
What a fantastic car!

00:58.551 --> 00:59.843
I can't thank you enough.

01:04.703 --> 01:08.897
To get everything works, together in one moment.

01:09.783 --> 01:12.363
And to head for the 300 mile boundary,...

01:12.847 --> 01:16.865
...it was like heading for the pinnacle of automobile competition.
