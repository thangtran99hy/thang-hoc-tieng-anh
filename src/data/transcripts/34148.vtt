Manufacturing steel is one of the largest industrial sources of greenhouse gas emissions.

00:10.559 --> 00:12.791
If it could be done in a carbon-free way,...

00:13.035 --> 00:16.496
...it would revolutionize the industry and help fight climate change.

00:16.743 --> 00:19.677
There's a company in Boston trying to do just that.

00:24.893 --> 00:28.498
If we can cut greenhouse gas emissions from steel,...

00:28.833 --> 00:32.409
...that's almost 10% of CO2 emissions.

00:32.619 --> 00:33.799
That's worth going after.

00:34.241 --> 00:36.302
No one's going to pay a premium for green metal.

00:36.455 --> 00:39.207
It's got to be better, cleaner and cheaper.

00:40.067 --> 00:43.042
Conventional process to make steel, it's a chemical reaction.

00:43.230 --> 00:49.352
The blast of air goes in, passes over a form of carbon and converts to a carbon monoxide gas.

00:49.627 --> 00:52.725
And that gas reduces the iron oxide to iron.

00:52.875 --> 00:57.207
So, for every ton of iron you make, you make several tons of CO2.

00:57.433 --> 00:58.591
You got iron oxide.

00:58.823 --> 01:02.311
You dissolve that into a mix of other oxides.

01:02.513 --> 01:07.550
And by that passage of electric current, the iron oxide is decomposed,...

01:07.828 --> 01:09.592
...and it produces liquid iron.

01:09.717 --> 01:14.078
The oxygen out of the iron oxide comes off as oxygen gas.

01:14.336 --> 01:16.615
The production of C02 is zero.

01:16.823 --> 01:21.729
The electricity can be produced sustainably without CO2 emissions.

01:21.971 --> 01:25.451
In big industry, capital intensive, risk averse,...

01:25.727 --> 01:29.169
...disruption in those industries does not come within the industry.

01:29.304 --> 01:30.993
It comes outside the industry.

01:31.329 --> 01:32.859
So, we're the disruptors.
