00:01.457 --> 00:03.663
This is not a drill.

00:04.453 --> 00:06.378
My name is Greta Thunberg.

00:07.021 --> 00:10.110
We are living in the beginning of a mass extinction.

00:11.019 --> 00:13.328
Our climate is breaking down.

00:14.129 --> 00:18.254
Children like me are giving up their education to protest.

00:18.671 --> 00:20.617
But we can still fix this.

00:21.211 --> 00:22.891
You can still fix this.

00:23.329 --> 00:24.712
So what should we do?

00:25.161 --> 00:28.440
We need to protect, restore and fund.

00:28.706 --> 00:32.773
All around the world, there are amazing movements fighting for nature.

00:33.057 --> 00:33.735
Join them.

00:34.307 --> 00:35.576
Everything counts.

00:38.223 --> 00:40.211
What you do counts.
