Hi, I'm Bill.

00:02.988 --> 00:03.588
Hi Bill, Robert.

00:03.670 --> 00:04.211
Nice to meet you.

00:04.483 --> 00:06.837
Hey, congratulations on being the Teacher of the Year.

00:06.951 --> 00:08.117
Thank you very much, appreciate it.

00:08.506 --> 00:09.867
So, what kind of things do you teach?

00:10.110 --> 00:12.375
I teach family and consumer sciences and leadership.

00:12.967 --> 00:16.277
What we're going to do today is, we're going to use the legs, the wings and the thighs...

00:16.380 --> 00:17.755
...for barbecue chicken, oven baked.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.674
We start with the whole chicken because it is cheaper to buy a whole chicken,...

00:20.975 --> 00:23.471
...cut it into pieces yourself and you can get a lot more out of it.

00:27.711 --> 00:29.275
What we're going to do next is season the chicken,...

00:29.393 --> 00:30.952
...get it on the pan and then to the oven to cook.

00:31.028 --> 00:33.168
So to season it, we've got some black pepper,...

00:33.415 --> 00:35.696
... we've got salt, cinnamon and allspice.

00:36.740 --> 00:38.089
And some ground mustard.

00:38.245 --> 00:39.075
So we've got everything.

00:39.293 --> 00:40.579
So we've got, except that one.

00:40.710 --> 00:41.482
Let's not do too much.

00:41.556 --> 00:41.941
That's okay.

00:42.282 --> 00:42.557
That's okay.

00:42.677 --> 00:43.696
You've just got some extra salt.

00:43.887 --> 00:44.751
I like mine salty.

00:44.942 --> 00:45.846
That's totally fine.

00:46.065 --> 00:50.491
And then we're just kind of evenly sprinkle the spices onto the chicken.

00:50.672 --> 00:51.908
Feels like a chef thing to do.

00:52.027 --> 00:52.445
Absolutely.

00:53.165 --> 00:54.349
We'll let those cook for a little while,...

00:54.439 --> 00:55.697
...we'll baste them with some sauce later.

00:55.816 --> 00:58.290
I think we're going to take a minute to baste some sauce on our chicken.

00:58.533 --> 00:59.191
I like sauce.

01:03.688 --> 01:04.679
That's really good.

01:04.954 --> 01:05.970
Hey, thanks for coming.

01:06.175 --> 01:07.369
It's pretty inspiring to hear what you do.

01:07.451 --> 01:08.429
This is a first for me.

01:08.617 --> 01:11.681
I might surprise my family and show them I know how to do it.

01:12.117 --> 01:12.819
That was fantastic.

01:12.908 --> 01:13.229
That's awesome.

01:13.352 --> 01:14.010
Thanks for having me.

01:14.327 --> 01:14.702
Appreciate it.
