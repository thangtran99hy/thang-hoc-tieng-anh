The lungs bring oxygen into the body when you breathe.

00:03.936 --> 00:06.917
From there, it has to find its way to every other part of your body,...

00:07.281 --> 00:09.212
...and the blood is its delivery service.

00:09.523 --> 00:12.181
The heart pumps blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen...

00:12.412 --> 00:15.511
...then pumps the oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body.

00:15.970 --> 00:18.464
After the blood has delivered all the oxygen,...

00:18.729 --> 00:21.444
...it picks up carbon dioxide, a waste product.

00:21.841 --> 00:25.367
Then the blood goes back to the lungs to drop off the carbon dioxide...

00:25.443 --> 00:27.123
...and pick up more oxygen.

00:27.462 --> 00:30.219
And the whole process begins again.
