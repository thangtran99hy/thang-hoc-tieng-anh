00:00.969 --> 00:02.590
What are clouds?

00:05.269 --> 00:07.559
Have you ever looked at clouds?

00:09.401 --> 00:11.180
Did they look like shapes?

00:12.709 --> 00:15.669
Have you ever wished you could float on a cloud?

00:17.834 --> 00:20.467
Clouds are fun to watch and think about.

00:21.351 --> 00:23.373
But what are they really?

00:24.259 --> 00:27.216
Did you know there are water drops in the air?

00:28.101 --> 00:31.761
These water drops are so tiny that they float.

00:32.445 --> 00:35.436
If there are a lot, they collect in groups.

00:36.288 --> 00:40.114
When water collects in the air, it forms clouds.

00:40.833 --> 00:43.322
Clouds are made of water drops.
