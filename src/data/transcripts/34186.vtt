00:00.757 --> 00:12.088
The food chain comprises of the producers, consumers and decomposers.

00:15.367 --> 00:17.169
Plants are producers.

00:17.397 --> 00:24.298
They absorb sunlight which is readily available, water and other nutrients from the soil...

00:24.787 --> 00:29.247
...and produce their food through a process called photosynthesis.

00:29.937 --> 00:35.626
Plants are the only living being which creates new energy for the other living beings.

00:36.408 --> 00:40.223
Consumers: animals are consumers.

00:40.905 --> 00:45.791
This is because they don't produce energy, they just use it up.

00:46.745 --> 00:52.784
Animals that eat plants are called primary consumers or herbivores.

00:53.792 --> 01:00.273
Animals that eat other animals are called secondary consumers or carnivores.

01:00.813 --> 01:06.775
If a carnivore eats another carnivore, it is called a tertiary consumer.

01:08.210 --> 01:13.767
Some animals play both roles, eating both plants and animals.

01:14.392 --> 01:16.736
They are called omnivores.

01:17.767 --> 01:22.977
Decomposers: bacteria and fungi are decomposers.

01:23.621 --> 01:26.276
They are also called detritivores.

01:26.921 --> 01:30.931
They eat decaying matter, that is dead plants and animals...

01:31.157 --> 01:35.913
...and in the process, they break them down and decompose them.

01:36.520 --> 01:42.287
When that happens, they release nutrients and mineral salts back into the soil,...

01:43.059 --> 01:46.643
...which then is used by the plants.
