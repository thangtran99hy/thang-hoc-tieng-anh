00:00.375 --> 00:02.932
When the sun heats up the rivers and oceans,...

00:03.172 --> 00:08.280
...water becomes water vapor and it rises up in the air.

00:08.959 --> 00:11.839
This process is called evaporation.

00:12.793 --> 00:15.323
It is the first step of the water cycle.

00:16.280 --> 00:19.093
You too can see water vapor at home.

00:19.675 --> 00:22.301
Just tell your mommy to heat some water.

00:23.067 --> 00:30.387
As the water gets heated, you'll be able to see the water vapor rising up in the air.

00:31.313 --> 00:37.075
When the water vapor reaches up in the sky, it turns into tiny droplets of water.

00:38.179 --> 00:45.613
These water droplets along with various gases and dust particles come together to form clouds.

00:46.231 --> 00:48.907
This is known as condensation.

00:50.129 --> 00:54.607
Now, hold a cold lid over the vessel in which you heated water.

00:55.314 --> 01:01.806
When you open the lid after some time, you'll be able to see water droplets on the lid.

01:02.299 --> 01:05.211
That's exactly what condensation is!

01:06.235 --> 01:11.715
When the cloud becomes too heavy and it cannot hold any more water inside,...

01:12.132 --> 01:18.550
...it bursts open to give out rain, hail or snow.

01:19.247 --> 01:21.775
This is known as precipitation.

01:23.029 --> 01:29.901
As it rains, water gets collected in oceans, lakes and rivers.

01:31.199 --> 01:35.805
It even seeps through the soil and becomes ground water.
