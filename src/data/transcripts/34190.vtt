00:00.588 --> 00:03.148
Today, we'll learn about day and night.

00:03.911 --> 00:07.079
When we see the Sun is shining in the sky, it is day.

00:07.509 --> 00:09.254
And when we don't, it's night.

00:09.979 --> 00:15.825
So the question is why is the Sun in the sky seen at some times and not at others.

00:16.733 --> 00:22.737
We see that the Sun seems to move across the sky starting in the east in the morning.

00:23.192 --> 00:28.763
Then moves toward the south at noon and then finally toward the west as the day ends.

00:29.062 --> 00:31.236
Hmm, how does this happen?

00:32.279 --> 00:34.728
Let's see why we have days and nights.

00:35.412 --> 00:39.941
Let's assume this globe is our Earth and this lamp is the Sun.

00:40.381 --> 00:41.947
Now, look closely.

00:42.271 --> 00:44.972
The light is shining only on one side.

00:45.287 --> 00:46.439
This is day.

00:46.938 --> 00:50.282
Now, look at the other part and you can see it's dark.

00:50.683 --> 00:51.934
This is night.

00:52.725 --> 00:58.177
When the Earth rotates, day changes to night and night changes to day.

00:58.731 --> 01:02.723
That's how the rotation of the Earth causes day and night.

01:03.133 --> 01:04.127
Pretty cool.
