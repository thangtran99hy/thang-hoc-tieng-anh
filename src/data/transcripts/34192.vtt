00:00.293 --> 00:03.005
Let's see the different types of energy one by one.

00:03.667 --> 00:05.545
Gravitational energy.

00:06.063 --> 00:09.701
It is associated with gravity or gravitational force.

00:10.053 --> 00:16.646
It is the energy held by an object because of its high position compared to a lower position.

00:17.268 --> 00:20.226
For example, see these elephants?

00:20.535 --> 00:26.230
This one has more gravitational potential energy as it is on higher ground.

00:26.719 --> 00:32.871
And this one has less whereas gravitational force acting on both is the same.

00:33.485 --> 00:35.424
Thermal or heat energy.

00:35.925 --> 00:41.033
It is created from the vibration of molecules and atoms within substances.

00:41.557 --> 00:47.603
The faster they move, the more energy they produce and the hotter they become.

00:48.297 --> 00:49.259
Chemical energy.

00:49.931 --> 00:54.455
It is the potential of a chemical substance that undergoes a transformation...

00:54.550 --> 00:59.061
...through a chemical reaction to transform other chemical substances.

01:00.258 --> 01:05.599
For example, the food we eat is digested to convert chemical energy...

01:05.865 --> 01:09.075
...into other forms of energy used by cells.

01:10.027 --> 01:11.339
Electrical energy.

01:11.857 --> 01:16.400
It is generated by moving electric charges called electrons.

01:16.832 --> 01:20.967
Lighting and electric cells are examples of electrical energy.

01:21.975 --> 01:23.807
Radiant or light energy.

01:24.433 --> 01:27.595
It is a form of electromagnetic radiation.

01:27.987 --> 01:33.507
Light travels in waves and it's the only kind of energy humans can see.

01:33.865 --> 01:36.431
For example, the energy from the Sun.
