Some people don't recognize how important Nigeria is.

00:07.839 --> 00:12.416
In sub-Saharan Africa, almost a quarter of the people live in one country.

00:13.525 --> 00:15.790
I'm here with my friend, Aliko Dangote.

00:16.091 --> 00:20.815
A lot of people, they're not really aware of the malnutrition issues that we have in Nigeria.

00:21.634 --> 00:24.464
Malnutrition is such a gigantic problem.

00:24.790 --> 00:27.303
Part of it is just getting enough food,...

00:28.154 --> 00:32.815
...but another part is getting various vitamins, micronutrients.

00:33.229 --> 00:36.065
You really want a supplementation,...

00:36.414 --> 00:39.689
...where you take the things that low income households are buying...

00:39.858 --> 00:44.332
...and try to make sure that the iron, the vitamin A, a variety of other things,...

00:44.473 --> 00:46.569
...are included with those foods.

00:46.921 --> 00:51.079
We actually started iodizing our salt in 1998.

00:51.229 --> 00:59.632
In 2002, we started putting vitamin fortification in the sugar, in the flour, in the pasta.

01:00.113 --> 01:02.919
And now whatever that we produce in the Dangote group,...

01:03.080 --> 01:06.519
...whatever you eat, you have micronutrients there.

01:06.972 --> 01:09.590
Here we've got flour that's got the vitamin A in it.

01:09.705 --> 01:12.550
Here we've got salt with iodine in it.

01:13.155 --> 01:17.023
What we just want is for the government regulatory agencies to make sure that, yes,...

01:17.135 --> 01:20.540
...it is enforced everywhere, and that can really help...

01:20.660 --> 01:23.387
...in terms of stopping malnutrition in Nigeria.

01:24.272 --> 01:29.492
By solving problems in Nigeria, you can have a huge impact on all of Africa.
