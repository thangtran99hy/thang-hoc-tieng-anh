00:00.152 --> 00:03.937
The American fitness industry is worth over 30 billion dollars a year.

00:04.323 --> 00:06.879
That's a lot of fancy gear and gym memberships.

00:07.465 --> 00:09.781
But Memo doesn't believe in gadgets.

00:10.524 --> 00:12.513
This is Memo's heart monitor.

00:13.297 --> 00:14.754
This is Memo's gym.

00:15.670 --> 00:17.697
This is Memo's nutrition plan.

00:18.589 --> 00:20.633
And this is Memo's locker.

00:21.969 --> 00:26.133
Memo doesn't believe in swanky gyms or boutiquey yoga studios.

00:27.078 --> 00:33.269
He doesn't believe in self-promotion even though there would be a lot to promote.

00:34.503 --> 00:36.544
You know what Memo really believes in?

00:37.002 --> 00:38.741
Memo believes in running.

00:40.818 --> 00:44.973
On November 3rd, Memo will take a day off to run the New York City Marathon.

00:45.964 --> 00:48.011
He's on track to run faster than ever.

00:49.559 --> 00:53.683
Memo reminds us that we're being sold and packaged something that's free.

00:54.416 --> 00:58.609
Achievement doesn't come from a sports brand or the latest hi-tech gizmo.

00:59.216 --> 01:00.142
Just ask Memo.

01:00.754 --> 01:02.328
He believes in just three...

01:02.403 --> 01:02.734
Two!

01:03.137 --> 01:03.502
Right.

01:04.054 --> 01:05.303
Two things.

01:07.881 --> 01:09.073
That's the Memo method.
