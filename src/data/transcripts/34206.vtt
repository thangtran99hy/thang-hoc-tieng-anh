Best Performance By An Actor

00:04.270 --> 00:16.990
And the International Emmy for Best Performance by An Actor goes to Haluk Bilginer.

00:20.391 --> 00:21.016
Thank you.

00:22.043 --> 00:27.471
This is a great honor and my thanks to the Academy for this precious award.

00:27.813 --> 00:35.231
Am I allowed to invite the team, the great team that made this possible onto the stage, please?

00:36.159 --> 00:40.631
Kerem Catay, Onur Saylak, Hakan Gunday.

00:42.182 --> 00:45.499
I share this award with these wonderful people.

00:45.696 --> 00:47.659
It was a great pleasure to work with them.

00:48.264 --> 00:55.674
And our series "Persona" is about justice and amnesia,...

00:56.334 --> 01:03.721
...but not amnesia of an individual but more dangerously and harmfully amnesia of the society.

01:04.772 --> 01:10.658
Therefore, please make sure the society you live in does not suffer from amnesia.

01:11.617 --> 01:20.299
If I may, I'd like to dedicate this award to my little daughter, Nazli Bilginer,...

01:20.766 --> 01:24.695
...in the hope that one day, she may choose acting as a profession.

01:25.245 --> 01:25.902
Thank you very much.
