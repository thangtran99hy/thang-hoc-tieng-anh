00:00.429 --> 00:07.075
As you might notice, the product of any number and multiplicative inverse is always one.

00:07.658 --> 00:12.010
If we want to divide by zero, we need to find its multiplicative inverse,...

00:12.231 --> 00:14.625
...which should be one over zero.

00:15.117 --> 00:20.699
This would have to be such a number that multiplying it by zero would give one.

00:21.516 --> 00:25.133
But because anything multiplied by zero is still zero,...

00:25.387 --> 00:30.527
...such a number is impossible, so zero has no multiplicative inverse.

00:31.123 --> 00:34.673
So if they can do that, couldn't we just make up a new rule,...

00:34.976 --> 00:39.595
...say that the symbol infinity means one over zero and see what happens?

00:40.944 --> 00:44.981
Let's try it, imagining we don't know anything about infinity already.

00:45.275 --> 00:47.836
Based on the definition of a multiplicative inverse,...

00:48.035 --> 00:51.296
...zero times infinity must be equal to one.

00:51.637 --> 00:57.383
That means zero times infinity plus zero times infinity should equal two.

00:58.094 --> 00:59.843
Now, by the disruptive property,...

01:00.061 --> 01:05.703
...the left side of the equation can be rearranged to zero plus zero times infinity.

01:06.318 --> 01:09.387
And since zero plus zero is definitely zero,...

01:09.713 --> 01:12.915
...that reduces down to zero times infinity.

01:13.250 --> 01:16.791
Unfortunately, we've already defined this as equal to one,...

01:17.277 --> 01:21.251
...while the other side of the equation is still telling us it's equal to two.

01:21.677 --> 01:23.973
So, one equals two.

01:24.810 --> 01:31.045
Oddly enough, that's not necessarily wrong; it's just not true in our normal world of numbers.

01:31.687 --> 01:34.052
There's still a way it could be mathematically valid,...

01:34.336 --> 01:38.284
...if one, two and every other number were equal to zero.

01:38.693 --> 01:41.046
But having infinity equal to zero,...

01:41.325 --> 01:46.191
...is ultimately not all that useful to mathematicians or anyone else.
