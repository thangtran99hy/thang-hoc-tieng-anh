Hello everyone.

00:10.460 --> 00:13.940
Today, we are going to look at shopping malls.

00:15.842 --> 00:20.391
Shopping malls are very big buildings with lots of shops in them.

00:21.729 --> 00:31.092
There are clothes shops, perfume shops, toy shops, food shops and many other types of shops.

00:32.457 --> 00:36.742
For many people, a trip to the mall is very exciting.

00:38.294 --> 00:45.735
There are cafes and cinemas at many malls so they're a good opportunity to meet with friends.

00:47.591 --> 00:52.681
For people who like shopping, there are so many choices of things to buy.

00:54.674 --> 00:58.401
All of this together can be a fun experience.

00:59.371 --> 01:02.417
And this makes some people very happy.

01:04.576 --> 01:09.882
However, some other people find malls noisy and crowded.

01:18.123 --> 01:24.450
There are lots of bright lights at malls and lots of loud noises including music.

01:25.731 --> 01:31.625
All of this can cause headaches, and for this reason, some people do not like malls.

01:35.293 --> 01:38.711
The world's biggest shopping mall is in China.

01:39.698 --> 01:46.769
Its name is the New South China Mall and it opened in 2005.

01:49.216 --> 01:55.420
For some reason, this mall is not very successful and few people visited.

01:56.846 --> 02:01.007
Perhaps this is because it is a long way from any big city.

02:03.896 --> 02:10.409
Another very big mall is the Dubai Mall in the United Arab Emirates.

02:15.849 --> 02:20.505
This mall is so big that it even has an aquarium inside.

02:21.771 --> 02:26.675
There is also a theme park, an ice rink, and some hotels.

02:29.095 --> 02:32.954
In the future, perhaps malls will get even bigger.

02:34.410 --> 02:39.252
Who knows, maybe one day, there will be a mall the size of a city.

02:41.860 --> 02:44.473
That brings us to the end of today's talk.

02:45.416 --> 02:49.639
I hope you enjoyed it and look forward to seeing you all next time.

02:51.126 --> 02:51.881
Goodbye.
