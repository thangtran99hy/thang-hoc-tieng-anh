00:01.149 --> 00:05.655
So when a bicycle kick is scored, it's usually one of the most amazing sights in football.

00:05.847 --> 00:07.633
And because of the complexity of the technique,...

00:07.938 --> 00:11.023
...if it does hit the back of the net, it's usually shown all over the world.

00:11.393 --> 00:13.348
And the circumstance where a bicycle kick might occur...

00:13.609 --> 00:16.313
...is when a player's running into the box anticipating a cross...

00:16.579 --> 00:19.345
...and the ball actually ends up going high and behind the player,...

00:19.561 --> 00:23.303
...so they have to turn around with their back to goal and it's too high for them to head...

00:23.493 --> 00:25.799
...or too high for them to take down on their chest and volley,...

00:26.017 --> 00:28.045
...so they have to hit it first time out of the air.

00:28.152 --> 00:31.985
So they drive up into the air, their foot comes up and they're kicking it over their head...

00:32.178 --> 00:34.113
...and usually it surprises the goalkeeper.
