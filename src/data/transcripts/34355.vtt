For decades, human beings have played games against computers.

00:03.678 --> 00:05.364
At first, the computers struggled.

00:05.737 --> 00:06.893
But then, they started winning.

00:07.089 --> 00:07.603
Watson!

00:07.783 --> 00:08.751
What is Creed?

00:08.936 --> 00:09.243
Yes!

00:09.673 --> 00:13.562
And now they've become so dominant that they're raising doubts about the future of humanity.

00:14.147 --> 00:17.317
The latest emblem for existential dread is Google's DeepMind project,...

00:17.665 --> 00:18.825
...which created AlphaGo,...

00:19.157 --> 00:23.468
...an AI program that's become unbeatable at the most complex strategy game on the planet.

00:23.953 --> 00:27.466
While the game of checkers has 10 to the power of 20 possible outcomes,...

00:27.567 --> 00:30.934
...and a game of chess has 10 to the power of 40 possible outcomes,...

00:31.115 --> 00:33.969
...Go has 10 to the power of 80 possible outcomes.

00:34.449 --> 00:36.829
AlphaGo is trained to analyze situations itself,....

00:37.033 --> 00:41.486
...by breaking the game down to tiny parts and visualizing all possible moves.

00:42.249 --> 00:45.575
It played the world's best Go player, 19-year-old Ke Jie,...

00:46.081 --> 00:47.419
...with the help of a human handler.

00:47.965 --> 00:51.460
AlphaGo beat him three times and after doing what it was designed to do,...

00:51.749 --> 00:52.808
...retired from the game.

00:53.558 --> 00:57.381
If a system like AlphaGo can learn all the moves in Go well enough to beat a person,...

00:57.803 --> 01:02.283
...then it has the potential to replace lawyers and accountants, among dozens of other jobs.

01:02.931 --> 01:06.745
It might be perfect, but it has no way to navigate human politics.
