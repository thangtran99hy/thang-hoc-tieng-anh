00:13.065 --> 00:15.889
Everyone, please think of your biggest personal goal.

00:16.744 --> 00:18.209
For real, you can take a second.

00:18.289 --> 00:19.314
You've got to feel this to learn it.

00:19.633 --> 00:22.942
Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal, okay?

00:24.166 --> 00:26.386
Imagine deciding right now that you're going to do it.

00:26.802 --> 00:29.738
Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do.

00:30.086 --> 00:33.440
Imagine their congratulations, and their high image of you.

00:33.948 --> 00:35.907
Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud?

00:36.367 --> 00:40.681
Don't you feel one step closer already, like it's already becoming part of your identity?

00:41.832 --> 00:44.905
Well, bad news: you should have kept your mouth shut,...

00:45.346 --> 00:48.563
...because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it.

00:49.447 --> 00:54.923
The repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen.

00:55.974 --> 00:58.826
Any time you have a goal, there are some steps that need to be done,...

00:58.934 --> 01:00.757
...some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it.

01:01.373 --> 01:04.210
Ideally you would not be satisfied until you'd actually done the work.

01:04.647 --> 01:07.851
But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it,...

01:08.295 --> 01:10.595
...psychologists have found that it's called a "social reality."

01:10.665 --> 01:13.025
The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done.

01:13.603 --> 01:15.892
And then because you've felt that satisfaction,...

01:16.251 --> 01:19.549
...you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary.
