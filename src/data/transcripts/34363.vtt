00:00.703 --> 00:04.887
So this goes against the conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals, right?

00:05.030 --> 00:07.271
So they hold us to it.

00:07.774 --> 00:09.473
So, let's look at the proof.

00:09.881 --> 00:13.949
1926: Kurt Lewin, founder of social psychology, called this "substitution."

00:14.321 --> 00:19.024
1933: Wera Mahler found when it was acknowledged by others, it felt real in the mind.

00:19.458 --> 00:22.009
1982, Peter Gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this,...

00:22.136 --> 00:25.764
...and in 2009, he did some new tests that were published.

00:26.119 --> 00:30.577
It goes like this: 163 people across four separate tests.

00:31.206 --> 00:33.126
Everyone wrote down their personal goal.

00:33.511 --> 00:38.461
Then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room, and half didn't.

00:39.454 --> 00:43.427
Then everyone was given 45 minutes of work that would directly lead them towards their goal,...

00:43.647 --> 00:45.517
...but they were told that they could stop at any time.

00:46.247 --> 00:50.714
Now, those who kept their mouths shut worked the entire 45 minutes on average,...

00:50.965 --> 00:52.324
...and when asked afterward,...

00:52.597 --> 00:55.694
...said that they felt that they had a long way to go still to achieve their goal.

00:56.327 --> 01:00.354
But those who had announced it quit after only 33 minutes, on average,...

01:00.790 --> 01:04.797
...and when asked afterward, said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal.

01:05.357 --> 01:07.717
So if this is true, what can we do?

01:08.521 --> 01:12.088
Well, you could resist the temptation to announce your goal.

01:12.843 --> 01:16.759
You can delay the gratification that the social acknowledgement brings,...

01:17.265 --> 01:20.776
...and you can understand that your mind mistakes the talking for the doing.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.689
But if you do need to talk about something,...

01:24.015 --> 01:27.140
...you can state it in a way that gives you no satisfaction,...

01:28.477 --> 01:30.233
...such as, "I really want to run this marathon,...

01:30.315 --> 01:33.730
...so I need to train five times a week and kick my ass if I don't, okay?"

01:34.647 --> 01:38.673
So audience, next time you're tempted to tell someone your goal, what will you say?

01:39.456 --> 01:40.207
Exactly!

01:40.323 --> 01:40.950
Well done.
