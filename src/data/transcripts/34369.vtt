00:12.997 --> 00:16.363
Imagine, if you will - a gift.

00:17.449 --> 00:19.209
I'd like for you to picture it in your mind.

00:20.421 --> 00:23.486
It's not too big - about the size of a golf ball.

00:24.226 --> 00:26.432
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up.

00:28.155 --> 00:32.779
But before I show you what's inside, I will tell you, it's going to do incredible things for you.

00:33.831 --> 00:36.161
It will bring all of your family together.

00:37.005 --> 00:39.717
You will feel loved and appreciated like never before...

00:40.121 --> 00:43.704
...and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you haven't heard from in years.

00:44.285 --> 00:47.579
Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you.

00:48.899 --> 00:51.612
It will recalibrate what's most important in your life.

00:52.487 --> 00:56.255
It will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith.

00:57.346 --> 01:00.592
You'll have a new understanding and trust in your body.

01:01.415 --> 01:04.127
You'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy.

01:04.914 --> 01:10.387
You'll expand your vocabulary, meet new people, and you'll have a healthier lifestyle.

01:11.557 --> 01:17.810
And get this - you'll have an eight-week vacation of doing absolutely nothing.

01:18.623 --> 01:20.708
You'll eat countless gourmet meals.

01:20.921 --> 01:23.234
Flowers will arrive by the truckload.

01:23.853 --> 01:26.259
People will say to you, "You look great.

01:26.573 --> 01:27.832
Have you had any work done?"

01:29.193 --> 01:32.678
And you'll have a lifetime supply of good drugs.
