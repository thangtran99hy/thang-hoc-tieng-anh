00:00.797 --> 00:06.275
You'll be challenged, inspired, motivated and humbled.

00:07.124 --> 00:08.656
Your life will have new meaning.

00:09.796 --> 00:15.867
Peace, health, serenity, happiness, nirvana.

00:17.204 --> 00:18.159
The price?

00:18.593 --> 00:23.813
$55,000, and that's an incredible deal.

00:25.080 --> 00:29.294
By now I know you're dying to know what it is and where you can get one.

00:30.068 --> 00:31.457
Does Amazon carry it?

00:32.025 --> 00:33.831
Does it have the Apple logo on it?

00:34.599 --> 00:35.853
Is there a waiting list?

00:37.135 --> 00:37.751
Not likely.

00:39.359 --> 00:41.379
This gift came to me about five months ago.

00:41.662 --> 00:45.003
It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up - not quite so pretty.

00:46.773 --> 00:51.318
And this, and then this.

00:53.021 --> 01:02.065
It was a rare gem - a brain tumor, hemangioblastoma - the gift that keeps on giving.

01:03.284 --> 01:07.049
And while I'm okay now, I wouldn't wish this gift for you.

01:07.445 --> 01:08.851
I'm not sure you'd want it.

01:09.686 --> 01:11.487
But I wouldn't change my experience.

01:12.517 --> 01:18.029
It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn't expect in all the ways I just shared with you.

01:19.302 --> 01:26.393
So the next time you're faced with something that's unexpected, unwanted and uncertain,...

01:27.278 --> 01:31.230
...consider that it just may be a gift.
