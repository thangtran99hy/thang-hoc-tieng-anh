This is the house in Beirut that Carlos Ghosn is said to have fled to,...

00:04.796 --> 00:06.213
...but there is no sign of him here;...

00:06.527 --> 00:11.034
...just lights and the security guards outside saying he is not at home.

00:12.363 --> 00:16.589
Many Lebanese view the former Nissan CEO as a successful businessman...

00:16.884 --> 00:19.458
...and is a symbol of their country's large diaspora.

00:19.977 --> 00:23.878
But in Tokyo, the unexpected turn of events has sparked outrage.

00:25.110 --> 00:29.175
Ghosn's escape to Lebanon is the latest stunning twist in a roller coaster journey...

00:29.252 --> 00:32.207
...that saw him fall from boardroom  to detention center.

00:34.073 --> 00:37.781
Here, he spent more than 100 days in Spartan conditions,...

00:37.876 --> 00:41.232
...far removed from his sometimes extravagant lifestyle.

00:43.417 --> 00:47.312
The automotive tycoon  stands accused of underreporting his salary...

00:47.520 --> 00:49.877
...to the tune of 85 million dollars.

00:50.462 --> 00:54.211
Prosecutors also alleged he skimmed off millions of dollars from the company...

00:54.313 --> 00:55.673
...for his personal use.

00:56.529 --> 00:59.320
Japan does not have an extradition treaty with Lebanon,...

00:59.695 --> 01:03.151
...so it's unclear what steps Tokyo might take next.
