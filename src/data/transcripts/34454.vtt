00:16.555 --> 00:17.397
What's in the box?

00:19.081 --> 00:21.257
Whatever it is must be pretty important,...

00:21.795 --> 00:27.062
...because I've traveled with it, moved it, from apartment to apartment to apartment.

00:32.789 --> 00:33.312
Sound familiar?

00:35.779 --> 00:40.919
Did you know that we Americans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago?

00:42.084 --> 00:42.842
Three times.

00:44.305 --> 00:49.361
So you'd think, with all this extra space, we'd have plenty of room for all our stuff.

00:50.201 --> 00:50.573
Nope.

00:52.290 --> 00:53.455
There's a new industry in town,...

00:53.563 --> 00:58.946
...a 22-billion-dollar, 2.2-billion square foot industry: that of personal storage.

00:59.778 --> 01:06.193
So we've got triple the space, but we've become such good shoppers that we need even more space.

01:07.225 --> 01:08.107
So, where does this lead?

01:09.113 --> 01:13.135
Lots of credit card debt, huge environmental footprints,...

01:13.921 --> 01:19.305
...and perhaps not coincidentally, our happiness levels flatlined over the same 50 years.

01:20.124 --> 01:24.293
Well, I'm here to suggest there's a better way, that less might actually equal more.

01:25.047 --> 01:28.798
I bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less:...

01:30.842 --> 01:37.014
...college - in your dorm, traveling - in a hotel room, camping,...

01:37.162 --> 01:39.213
...where you've got basically nothing, maybe a boat.

01:40.053 --> 01:43.067
Whatever it was for you, I bet that, among other things,...

01:43.593 --> 01:46.610
....this gave you a little more freedom, a little more time.

01:48.718 --> 01:54.225
So, I'm going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint.

01:54.635 --> 01:56.519
It's actually a great way to save you some money.

01:56.745 --> 01:58.515
And it's going to give you a little more ease in your life.

01:58.978 --> 02:03.916
So, I started a project called LifeEdited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation...

02:04.006 --> 02:06.316
...and to find some great solutions in this area.

02:07.246 --> 02:14.782
First up: crowdsourcing my 420 square feet apartment in Manhattan with partners Mutopo and Jovoto.com.

02:15.054 --> 02:22.815
I wanted it all - home office, sit-down dinner for 10, room for guests, and all my kitesurfing gear.

02:23.631 --> 02:28.485
With over 300 entries from around the world, I got it, my own little jewel box.

02:29.597 --> 02:36.480
By buying a space that was 420 square feet instead of 600, immediately I'm saving 200 grand.

02:37.441 --> 02:40.411
Smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities,...

02:40.695 --> 02:44.433
... save some more money there, but also a smaller footprint.

02:45.231 --> 02:49.162
And because it's really designed around an edited set of possessions,...

02:49.233 --> 02:52.795
...my favorite stuff and really designed for me, I'm really excited to be there.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.301
So how can you live little?

02:56.153 --> 02:56.989
Three main approaches.

02:57.658 --> 02:59.405
First of all, you have to edit ruthlessly.

03:00.099 --> 03:02.808
We've got to clear the arteries of our lives.

03:03.241 --> 03:06.006
And that shirt that I hadn't worn in years?

03:06.753 --> 03:07.841
It's time for me to let it go.

03:08.443 --> 03:11.054
We've got to cut the extraneous out of our lives,...

03:11.443 --> 03:13.986
...and we've got to learn to stem the inflow.

03:14.692 --> 03:16.207
We need to think before we buy.

03:16.677 --> 03:19.457
Ask ourselves, "Is that really going to make me happier?

03:19.875 --> 03:20.449
Truly?"

03:21.441 --> 03:25.515
By all means, we should buy and own some great stuff.

03:26.035 --> 03:29.650
But we want stuff that we're going to love for years, not just stuff.
