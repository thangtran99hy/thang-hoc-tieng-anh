00:00.377 --> 00:04.003
Secondly, our new mantra: small is sexy.

00:04.561 --> 00:05.853
We want space efficiency.

00:05.969 --> 00:11.845
We want things that are designed for how they're used the vast majority of the time, not that rare event.

00:12.517 --> 00:15.302
Why have a six-burner stove when you rarely use three?

00:16.214 --> 00:21.207
So we want things that nest, we want things that stack, and we want it digitized.

00:21.639 --> 00:27.530
You can take paperwork, books, movies, and you can make it disappear, it's magic.

00:27.989 --> 00:32.019
Finally, we want multifunctional spaces and housewares,...

00:32.564 --> 00:37.878
...a sink combined with a toilet, a dining table becomes a bed same space,...

00:38.431 --> 00:41.351
...a little side table stretches out to seat 10.

00:42.127 --> 00:44.765
In a winning LifeEdited scheme in a render here,...

00:44.969 --> 00:49.458
...we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space.

00:49.713 --> 00:54.761
Look at the coffee table, it grows in height and width to seat 10.

00:55.784 --> 00:58.715
My office folds away, easily hidden.

00:59.242 --> 01:01.927
My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers.

01:02.877 --> 01:03.516
Guests?

01:03.793 --> 01:06.924
Move the moving wall, have some fold-down guest beds.

01:07.540 --> 01:09.529
And of course, my own movie theater.

01:10.303 --> 01:13.995
So, I'm not saying that we all need to live in 420 square feet.

01:14.473 --> 01:16.787
But consider the benefits of an edited life.

01:17.593 --> 01:21.653
Go from 3,000 to 2,000, from 1,500 to 1,000.

01:22.231 --> 01:27.824
Most of us, maybe all of us, are here pretty happily for a bunch of days with a couple of bags,...

01:27.969 --> 01:29.573
...maybe a small space, a hotel room.

01:30.138 --> 01:34.780
So, when you go home and you walk through your front door, take a second and ask yourselves,...

01:35.436 --> 01:36.915
..."Could I do with a little life editing?

01:37.313 --> 01:38.898
Would that give me a little more freedom?

01:39.432 --> 01:40.865
Maybe a little more time?"

01:44.002 --> 01:45.232
What's in the box?

01:46.895 --> 01:48.274
It doesn't really matter.

01:49.489 --> 01:50.672
I know I don't need it.

01:52.884 --> 01:53.850
What's in yours?

01:54.765 --> 01:58.067
Maybe, just maybe, less might equal more.

01:59.046 --> 02:01.813
So let's make room for the good stuff.

02:03.284 --> 02:03.643
Thank you.
