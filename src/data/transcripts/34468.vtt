llwhea wants to know, "What was your favorite TV show growing up?"

00:06.327 --> 00:07.417
Excellent question.

00:08.589 --> 00:11.679
The Cosby Show, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

00:15.111 --> 00:16.724
You know what else I like?

00:16.926 --> 00:19.341
And this is gonna be embarrassing to say but I'm gonna say it.

00:20.015 --> 00:21.146
It's Small Wonder.

00:21.912 --> 00:22.699
I don't know why.

00:24.347 --> 00:28.623
But that was the funny show that I got with for some reason.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.609
After school, I put it on and it was just interesting to me.

00:31.936 --> 00:35.602
But it wasn't on the level of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Cosby.

00:35.698 --> 00:36.924
Those two were my favorite.
