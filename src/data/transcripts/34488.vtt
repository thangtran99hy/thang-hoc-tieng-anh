For many Americans, scenes from long conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians...

00:07.019 --> 00:09.849
...are all they know about Palestine and its people.

00:11.267 --> 00:15.830
That's why the founders of the new Museum of the Palestinian People in Washington, DC.,...

00:16.358 --> 00:20.647
...a space full of artwork, historical and cultural documentation, say...

00:21.044 --> 00:22.789
...this place is so important.

00:23.027 --> 00:24.965
We're showing Palestinians as human beings.

00:25.099 --> 00:26.921
We're showing Palestinians as entrepreneurs.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.422
We're showing Palestinians as artists.

00:29.747 --> 00:32.417
And that's why I decided to create this museum.

00:32.513 --> 00:36.143
So, it's a place where Palestinians can share their stories.

00:36.387 --> 00:38.207
As visitors enter the museum,...

00:38.477 --> 00:41.681
...the first piece they're welcomed by is a blue water pitcher.

00:42.060 --> 00:43.871
It is made of glass from Hebron,...

00:44.091 --> 00:47.757
...a city in the West Bank known for its glassblowing tradition.

00:48.118 --> 00:52.006
The museum walls are covered by photos, paintings and other artwork,...

00:52.316 --> 00:53.775
...telling Palestinian stories.

00:53.995 --> 00:58.018
The founders are very aware that some might see this museum...

00:58.123 --> 01:01.603
...in the politically-charged lens of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,...

01:01.913 --> 01:06.414
...but founder and workers here insist this is not about politics.

01:07.304 --> 01:11.062
Bshara hopes the museum will attract visitors from all walks of life...

01:11.459 --> 01:16.083
...and that it sparks a dialog about Palestinian history and its rich culture.
