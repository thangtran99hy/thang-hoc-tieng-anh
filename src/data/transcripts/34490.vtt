Harry and Meghan have become a mega couple, one of the most famous double acts in the world.

00:09.467 --> 00:11.706
With that fame has come attention,...

00:11.787 --> 00:16.503
...a ruthless press scrutiny that has appeared, at times, to wear down the couple.

00:17.970 --> 00:22.791
It hasn't always been clear the royals were totally comfortable with their allotted role.

00:23.931 --> 00:28.019
But perhaps no one expected the extraordinary statement released tonight,...

00:28.219 --> 00:30.349
...a statement that the BBC understands...

00:30.449 --> 00:34.453
...was made without the consultation of other royals including the Queen.

00:34.793 --> 00:38.511
They said, "After many months of reflection and internal discussions,...

00:38.881 --> 00:41.303
...we have chosen to make a transition this year...

00:41.501 --> 00:45.941
...in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution."

00:46.295 --> 00:50.786
They went on to say "We intend to step back as 'senior' members of the Royal Family...

00:51.037 --> 00:53.497
...and work to become financially independent,...

00:53.748 --> 00:57.063
...while continuing to fully support Her Majesty, The Queen.

00:57.451 --> 01:02.151
We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America.

01:02.934 --> 01:05.491
In response, a short statement from the palace,...

01:05.737 --> 01:08.637
..."We understand their decision to take a different approach,

01:08.812 --> 01:12.743
...but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through."

01:13.167 --> 01:18.017
It was a response that should be read not so much by what it said, but what it didn't say.

01:19.493 --> 01:22.482
Although few expected such a radical course of action,...

01:22.712 --> 01:25.386
...it was clear that the couple were struggling in their role.

01:25.749 --> 01:28.141
In an ITV documentary last year,...

01:28.381 --> 01:33.233
...the Duchess of Sussex opened up to the channel's Tom Bradby about the pressure she was under.

01:33.733 --> 01:36.731
It's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.

01:37.088 --> 01:44.064
And the answer is, would it be fair to say "Not really okay." and "It's really been a struggle."?

01:44.313 --> 01:44.754
Yes.
