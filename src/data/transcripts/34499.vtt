00:01.027 --> 00:05.981
New numbers emerging that showed the sad and terrible toll of Australia's wildfire crisis.

00:06.271 --> 00:08.702
A professor at the University of Sydney estimates...

00:08.929 --> 00:12.450
...nearly half a billion animals have been killed by the bushfires...

00:12.772 --> 00:15.912
...that have torched three million hectares of New South Wales alone.

00:16.345 --> 00:19.373
In a statement regarding how he reached the massive figure,...

00:19.668 --> 00:21.283
...Professor Chris Dickman explains...

00:21.567 --> 00:26.917
...it was founded on a report he co-wrote in 2007 for the World Wide Fund for Nature.

00:27.298 --> 00:30.310
It studied the impacts of land clearing on the state's wildlife...

00:30.601 --> 00:34.233
...and obtained estimates on the population density of mammals in the state.

00:34.672 --> 00:37.889
He's now multiplied that by the amount of land hit by the fires.

00:38.269 --> 00:40.289
Temperatures are reaching the high 40s...

00:40.536 --> 00:44.245
...and strong winds could push flames toward more populated areas,...

00:44.541 --> 00:46.177
...widening the path of destruction.
