00:00.665 --> 00:03.711
Now, that doesn't mean you're gonna be so complacent in life...

00:03.789 --> 00:08.343
...because we see them as very black-or-white.

00:08.415 --> 00:10.287
You're either ambitious or you're lazy.

00:11.036 --> 00:12.558
I don't think we're talking about either.

00:12.759 --> 00:17.604
You don't have to be ambitious in order to be detached or attached.

00:17.804 --> 00:24.817
You don't have to be lazy to say that "I don't attach myself on to the universe."

00:25.966 --> 00:33.080
Like if you're going to sit an exam, you might as well do that fairly well.

00:33.998 --> 00:39.448
If you have to sit the exam because you know it means I get into a university,...

00:39.699 --> 00:42.953
...university means I get a good degree and it means I get a job,...

00:43.233 --> 00:45.343
...which means I get a way of living.

00:45.797 --> 00:47.706
Now, those aren't crazy ambitions.

00:47.813 --> 00:49.810
They're just quite realistic ambitions.

00:50.359 --> 00:56.546
What is discouraged is when you go so far...

00:57.039 --> 01:04.826
...based on the fact that you've got this kind of almost addiction with materialism.

01:05.255 --> 01:10.447
Like your ambition is that "I want to drive a Ferrari and I want to own this...

01:10.527 --> 01:14.515
...and I want to live in a penthouse suite in the middle of New York."

01:14.697 --> 01:16.227
And you see, when you start saying...

01:16.775 --> 01:18.711
Now, society will tell you, "Those are great ambitions.

01:18.786 --> 01:20.935
Yeah, go for it. You go for it. Fantastic!

01:21.023 --> 01:22.302
And we'll cheer you all the way."

01:23.311 --> 01:24.007
But then what?

01:24.111 --> 01:27.130
Let's say you reach every single one of your dreams.

01:28.499 --> 01:31.917
Do you think the richest people in the world are the happiest people in the world?

01:33.649 --> 01:35.699
Now, you can be ambitious for other things.

01:36.167 --> 01:38.707
You can be ambitious to help the world.

01:40.387 --> 01:43.591
And that's not driven by a sense of personal satisfaction...

01:43.661 --> 01:45.786
...because in fact, that's a hard thing to do.

01:46.716 --> 01:49.234
Because you can go and live a perfectly comfortable life...

01:49.318 --> 01:50.861
...and say "Forget the rest of the world."

01:51.269 --> 01:54.073
You can be ambitious and driven and determined to do other things...

01:54.145 --> 01:55.718
...that's an ambition driven by love.

01:56.357 --> 01:59.680
You are already fulfilled. You're saying "My life is pretty good right now.

01:59.771 --> 02:01.379
I'm not trying to satisfy my life.

02:01.706 --> 02:03.139
I can try and help other people."

02:04.321 --> 02:06.175
So, there are different ways to be ambitious.

02:06.706 --> 02:09.266
The question is: What are your ambitions based upon?

02:09.352 --> 02:11.315
Are they based upon some false sense of hope?

02:11.840 --> 02:15.148
And if it is based on a false sense of hope that I'm going to be happy tomorrow,...

02:15.481 --> 02:18.532
...guru says "I can show you a way to be happy right now."

02:19.713 --> 02:22.531
So, it's not a question of "Should I be ambitious or not?"

02:22.961 --> 02:25.817
The question is: What is the driving factor behind that ambition?
