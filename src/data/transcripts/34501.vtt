00:01.779 --> 00:05.649
So, it's impossible really to put a number. Nobody can.

00:06.646 --> 00:08.531
How much debt is too much debt?

00:08.657 --> 00:12.162
If you look at Japan today, you see a country...

00:12.240 --> 00:16.941
...where the debt-to-GDP ratio is something like 240 percent.

00:17.714 --> 00:21.767
Well above, orders of magnitude above, where the US is today...

00:21.869 --> 00:25.300
...or even where the US is forecast to be in the future.

00:25.805 --> 00:31.813
And so, the question is: How is Japan able to sustain a debt of that size?

00:32.481 --> 00:34.242
Wouldn't it have an inflation problem?

00:34.335 --> 00:36.325
Wouldn't it lead to rising interest rates?

00:36.437 --> 00:40.159
Wouldn't this be destructive in some way? And the answer to all of those questions...

00:40.373 --> 00:45.222
...as Japan has demonstrated now for years is simply no.

00:45.631 --> 00:51.421
Japan's debt is close to 240 percent of GDP, almost a quadrillion,...

00:51.539 --> 00:53.435
...that's a very big number, yen.

00:53.812 --> 00:57.391
Long-term interest rates are very close to zero.

00:58.013 --> 01:02.175
There's no inflation problem and so, despite the size of the debt,...

01:02.605 --> 01:05.065
...there are no negative consequences...

01:05.191 --> 01:08.800
...as a result and I think Japan teaches us a really important lesson.
