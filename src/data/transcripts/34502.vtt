00:00.401 --> 00:04.659
By 2040, they estimate 40% of households will be single people.

00:05.401 --> 00:10.155
So, the traditional family is already departed.

00:10.459 --> 00:16.438
State policies are racing to catch up with realities on the ground.

00:16.920 --> 00:20.429
That day can't come fast enough for Masami Onishi.

00:20.582 --> 00:25.611
At home, the 24-year-old single mother handles her two young daughters with ease...

00:25.719 --> 00:28.629
...but she says, it hasn't always been the case.

00:29.515 --> 00:35.752
The single mother works 6 hours a day, 6 days a week just to earn 800 US dollars a month.

00:36.343 --> 00:39.546
The government wants to put more single mothers to work...

00:39.637 --> 00:43.390
...in order to reduce the 50% poverty rate among them.

00:43.745 --> 00:47.668
But, as Ms. Onishi's case shows, it doesn't really help.

00:48.473 --> 00:52.601
Poverty rate of single mothers doesn't change very much...

00:52.698 --> 00:55.127
...even if the mother is working.

00:55.485 --> 01:00.259
Because they have very weak position in the labor market...

01:00.387 --> 01:05.811
...because of the very huge gender gap, wage gap, in Japan.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.192
Doctor Zhou said it's crucial...

01:08.260 --> 01:11.743
...that the government boosts welfare support to single mothers...

01:11.821 --> 01:17.249
...because children raised in poverty aren't likely to escape even when they grow up.

01:17.607 --> 01:21.757
Yasuko Kawabe who started the dining hall for children of single mothers...

01:21.852 --> 01:25.299
...says that's precisely what she's seen over the years...

01:25.615 --> 01:29.076
...and she hopes an alternative route could open up soon.

01:30.097 --> 01:34.977
In an ageing society that desperately needs more future taxpayers,...

01:35.068 --> 01:38.369
...the government needs to help children of single parents...

01:38.455 --> 01:41.226
...become contributing members to society...

01:41.461 --> 01:45.185
...rather than seeing them as a burden and a disgrace.
