CDs might be past their prime in many parts of the world, but, in Japan,...

00:05.229 --> 00:06.881
...they are still going strong.

00:07.413 --> 00:12.661
Physical media like CDs and DVDs make up 80% of music sales here...

00:12.927 --> 00:16.991
...compared to just 34% in the United States and 49% in Britain.

00:18.470 --> 00:22.692
The Japanese now buy more CDs than consumers in any other country.

00:23.081 --> 00:27.777
And CD sales rose in 2012 while the number of digital downloads fell.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.455
Industry experts say a major factor...

00:30.535 --> 00:34.572
...is the value Japan's consumers place on having a material item.
