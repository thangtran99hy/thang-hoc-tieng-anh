Japan's own cinema industry has been struggling recently.

00:04.637 --> 00:10.277
But, box-office revenues have been given a boost, thanks to the popularity of anime,...

00:10.537 --> 00:13.721
...the unique Japanese style of hand-drawn animation.

00:14.096 --> 00:19.813
Directed by Makoto Shinkai, "Your Name" has been topping Japan's box-office charts...

00:19.895 --> 00:21.981
...since the release at the end of August.

00:22.625 --> 00:27.064
The Tokyo Film Festival has become an important event for the anime industry.

00:27.639 --> 00:31.839
And one of the genre's most successful directors, Mamoru Hosoda,...

00:32.071 --> 00:35.715
...is being honored this year with a retrospective of his work.

00:36.381 --> 00:41.033
Hosoda says the secret lies in stories that capture the hearts of grown-ups.

00:41.959 --> 00:44.664
Hosoda's feature, "The Boy and the Beast,"...

00:44.825 --> 00:47.785
...was the second highest-earning Japanese film last year.

00:48.140 --> 00:50.881
Making more than 55 million dollars.

00:51.090 --> 00:55.897
And like this year's megahit "Your Name," it proves that the anime experience...

00:55.973 --> 00:59.850
...delivers at the box-office as well as on the big screen.
