First, the dark web is not a place but a term to describe parts of the internet...

00:04.521 --> 00:06.630
...that hides your identity and location.

00:07.231 --> 00:10.773
The dark web's infrastructure was created in the 1970s...

00:11.121 --> 00:13.159
...at the same time as the internet itself.

00:13.393 --> 00:16.364
But to utilize it, you needed darknet software,...

00:16.766 --> 00:21.421
...and to the US Naval Research Lab who created it back in the early 2000s,...

00:21.630 --> 00:25.822
...one of the first and still the most popular darknet software, TOR.

00:26.357 --> 00:28.324
It was created for a number of reasons,...

00:28.528 --> 00:31.757
...which included providing the US Navy's intelligence offices...

00:32.031 --> 00:36.123
...with the means to maneuver through the internet without being recognized or traced.
