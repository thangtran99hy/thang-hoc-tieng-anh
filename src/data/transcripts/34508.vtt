00:00.701 --> 00:04.680
So, I've downloaded Tor, which looks like a normal web browser...

00:04.935 --> 00:07.015
...and seems to behave like one too.

00:07.163 --> 00:08.877
I can visit any site I like.

00:09.192 --> 00:13.707
But unlike normal web browsers which would register my IP address straightaway,...

00:14.050 --> 00:16.829
...the Tor browser bounces my request to enter the site...

00:16.973 --> 00:19.554
...via several computers around the world,...

00:19.727 --> 00:23.579
...encrypting and decrypting my identification as it goes...

00:23.805 --> 00:26.511
...so that no one knows where the request has come from.

00:26.923 --> 00:31.406
Now that I'm browsing the internet anonymously, certain websites have become accessible.

00:31.559 --> 00:34.233
Websites like the infamous Silk Road.

00:34.976 --> 00:37.885
The Silk Road was one of the first online black markets...

00:38.147 --> 00:40.852
...where you can buy drugs, guns and child pornography.

00:41.253 --> 00:46.528
Two years after starting the site, the founder, Ross Ulbricht was arrested in 2013...

00:46.788 --> 00:52.001
...and sentenced to life in prison for money laundering, drug trafficking, hacking and fraud.

00:52.241 --> 00:56.649
This was quickly followed by a shutdown of its successor, Silk Road 2.0,...

00:56.946 --> 01:01.726
...along with similar sites such as Project Black Flag and Black Market Reloaded.
