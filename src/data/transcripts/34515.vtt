Welcome to the Lightsaber Helpdesk.

00:08.994 --> 00:12.218
Ah, hello, yes, I'm having trouble with my lightsaber.

00:12.609 --> 00:14.488
Can I have your account number, please?

00:14.580 --> 00:15.036
My account?

00:16.211 --> 00:16.947
Where do I find that?

00:17.567 --> 00:20.861
It's the five-digit serial number on the handle.

00:21.078 --> 00:21.578
Ah, yes, I see.

00:21.697 --> 00:24.089
It's 00001.

00:25.507 --> 00:28.443
How can I help you today, Mr. Wader?

00:28.898 --> 00:29.821
It's Vader!

00:29.973 --> 00:31.588
Lord Darth Vader!

00:31.875 --> 00:33.421
Okay, Mr. Waiter, whatever.

00:33.493 --> 00:34.407
How can I help you?

00:34.493 --> 00:37.150
It's Vade... it doesn't matter.

00:37.241 --> 00:40.257
Look, my lightsaber won't make the "Voom!" sound when it comes on.

00:40.383 --> 00:42.081
Have you tried changing the batteries?

00:42.147 --> 00:43.174
I have replaced them.

00:43.299 --> 00:45.402
I'd like to speak to your supervisor.

00:45.881 --> 00:49.006
Well, have you pushed the reset button on the bottom of the handle?

00:49.116 --> 00:51.030
Ah, yes, I know about this.

00:51.501 --> 00:52.716
Could you just tell me how to do it again?

00:52.951 --> 00:57.117
Yep, try turning it 30 degrees, press reset and tap the handle at the same time.

00:57.253 --> 00:58.556
Everybody knows that.

00:58.779 --> 01:04.881
Ah, 30 degrees and, press and, hang on.

01:08.765 --> 01:09.715
I'm sorry, oops.

01:09.913 --> 01:11.004
Everything okay there?

01:11.700 --> 01:13.057
Oh, it's all working fine.

01:13.167 --> 01:13.509
Thank you.

01:13.773 --> 01:16.365
Thank you for calling the Lightsaber Helpdesk.
