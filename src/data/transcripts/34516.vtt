00:01.883 --> 00:03.467
What do you know about 80s fashion?

00:03.531 --> 00:04.840
Absolutely nothing.

00:05.007 --> 00:06.126
I don't know anything about that.

00:06.256 --> 00:09.546
80s fashion is what hipsters are wearing today.

00:09.627 --> 00:14.631
Like the headbands across, with the leotards and the colored tights.

00:14.718 --> 00:16.745
Women in blazers all the time.

00:17.091 --> 00:17.482
Awful!

00:17.569 --> 00:18.440
Shoulder pads.

00:18.941 --> 00:19.325
Awful.

00:19.440 --> 00:22.305
First off, one of the biggest trends in the 80s for women:...

00:22.455 --> 00:25.433
...clothing that had built-in shoulder pads.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.429
Why do you think this was a thing in the 80s?

00:27.511 --> 00:28.441
You tell me!

00:28.531 --> 00:29.139
I don't know.

00:29.229 --> 00:30.513
I wasn't alive in the 80s.

00:30.590 --> 00:31.723
I don't even know.

00:31.813 --> 00:34.659
I didn't know shoulder pads were that serious.

00:34.744 --> 00:36.713
Maybe it made their waists seem much smaller.

00:36.791 --> 00:39.318
Maybe it makes their heads look smaller,  I don't know.

00:39.399 --> 00:41.772
Women were becoming more active in business...

00:41.834 --> 00:44.895
...and they wanted to show that they were capable,...

00:44.966 --> 00:47.905
...and they wanted to show that they were not masculine, necessarily...

00:47.961 --> 00:49.613
...but could handle the same things as men.

00:49.677 --> 00:52.222
Well, one of the reasons was a movement called power dressing.

00:52.336 --> 00:53.133
Power Dressing.

00:53.368 --> 00:54.370
Sounds so awesome.

00:54.497 --> 00:55.307
Power Dressing!

00:55.481 --> 00:58.509
Women wanted to show that they were capable in society,...

00:58.624 --> 01:00.031
...so they wanted to look more masculine.

01:00.132 --> 01:01.249
Okay, that makes sense.

01:01.325 --> 01:05.029
When I put it on, it makes me feel powerful.

01:05.095 --> 01:08.981
I think that women can be as powerful as men without making themselves look like men.

01:09.065 --> 01:10.875
What do you think of the loud colors of the 80s?

01:10.946 --> 01:11.637
It's not for me.

01:11.742 --> 01:15.433
They were very loud and eccentric back then, weren't they?

01:15.515 --> 01:17.203
We're more subdued now.

01:17.285 --> 01:17.912
I love it.

01:18.208 --> 01:18.971
It's so fun.

01:19.035 --> 01:23.707
As a person that dresses in black almost twenty-four seven, this is a fun change.

01:23.789 --> 01:24.369
I love it.

01:26.051 --> 01:30.061
But that's coming from me, who has no style, no fashion sense whatsoever.

01:30.121 --> 01:32.487
Can you talk about why you think fashion trends even happen...

01:32.555 --> 01:34.928
...because why is something that is cool not always cool?

01:35.005 --> 01:37.331
Maybe because people realize how stupid it is.

01:37.560 --> 01:38.664
Because they're horrible.

01:38.836 --> 01:42.029
Each generation sees their parents in things and it's like "Ew! I don't want to wear those."

01:42.094 --> 01:45.675
If I saw my mom in Zubaz, this would be the geekiest thing I'd ever seen.

01:45.974 --> 01:47.615
But now that I'm wearing it, I love it.

01:47.748 --> 01:52.187
You can't wear the same thing forever, it has to change up and then it comes back.
