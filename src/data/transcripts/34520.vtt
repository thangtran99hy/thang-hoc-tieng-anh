00:00.050 --> 00:01.372
That's Tim Barnes over there.

00:01.563 --> 00:02.291
He's a reporter.

00:03.333 --> 00:04.813
Tim, this is Julia.

00:04.945 --> 00:05.837
She's our new trainee.

00:06.751 --> 00:07.015
Hi.

00:08.002 --> 00:08.485
Hi.

00:09.503 --> 00:10.917
This is a very interesting story, Martha.

00:10.991 --> 00:11.391
Look at this.

00:11.688 --> 00:13.715
Oh, tell me about it this afternoon, okay?

00:14.935 --> 00:15.219
Sure.

00:16.547 --> 00:17.637
See you around, Julie.

00:18.189 --> 00:18.723
Julia.

00:19.459 --> 00:19.885
Sorry.

00:20.229 --> 00:22.072
My name isn't Julie, it's Julia.

00:23.173 --> 00:23.795
Oh, right.

00:23.950 --> 00:25.747
And the address has got two Ds.

00:25.845 --> 00:26.117
What?

00:26.866 --> 00:28.483
Address is A - D - D.

00:31.305 --> 00:32.466
Right, thank you.

00:33.740 --> 00:34.639
Don't mention it.

00:37.406 --> 00:39.282
Who's that young woman with Martha and Shawn?

00:39.621 --> 00:40.473
Her name's Julia.

00:40.992 --> 00:41.981
She's the new trainee.

00:43.435 --> 00:44.157
She's very pretty.

00:50.581 --> 00:51.843
Well, that's everyone, I think

00:52.239 --> 00:53.024
Tea or coffee?

00:53.287 --> 00:54.121
Coffee please.

00:54.319 --> 00:54.947
Black or white?

00:55.113 --> 00:57.246
Oh, white with no sugar please.

00:59.140 --> 01:01.037
Hello, you're Julia aren't you?

01:01.299 --> 01:01.723
Yes.

01:02.357 --> 01:04.205
Pleased to meet you, I'm Gary.

01:04.413 --> 01:05.650
Nice to meet you, Gary.

01:05.902 --> 01:06.700
What do you do?

01:08.706 --> 01:09.589
I'm a newsreader.

01:10.767 --> 01:11.841
Oh yes!

01:12.177 --> 01:13.783
You're Gary Fenton.

01:15.267 --> 01:17.022
You're my mom's favorite newsreader.

01:17.313 --> 01:17.981
Here you are.

01:18.565 --> 01:20.159
Hello Gary, this is Julia.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.113
Yes, I know.

01:23.374 --> 01:24.664
Anyway, I must be off.

01:25.733 --> 01:26.069
See you.

01:27.999 --> 01:29.324
He's very nice.

01:30.004 --> 01:30.811
Yes.
