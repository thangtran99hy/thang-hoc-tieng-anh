00:00.659 --> 00:04.295
I look at the past cycles of these growths, these S-curves forming.

00:04.479 --> 00:07.862
It has determined so much of what we are, who we are, what we are after.

00:08.469 --> 00:09.464
Growth is about everything.

00:09.699 --> 00:10.817
Bacteria and babies.

00:11.700 --> 00:13.007
Economies and empires.

00:13.870 --> 00:14.672
Growth of everything.

00:16.137 --> 00:20.061
And what's fascinating is to look at these S-curves forming one after another...

00:20.325 --> 00:21.857
...in this technical innovation side.

00:21.960 --> 00:23.135
That's always the rule, you know.

00:23.735 --> 00:25.159
They're on this ascending stage.

00:25.237 --> 00:26.389
People say, "Oh, wow!" you know?

00:26.671 --> 00:28.347
And eventually, everything forms there.

00:28.573 --> 00:30.130
Now, we're on these plateaus...

00:30.275 --> 00:30.775
In many ways, yeah.

00:30.925 --> 00:34.901
Even the speed one, we had the supersonic transport.

00:35.901 --> 00:38.518
Today's planes don't fly any faster than Boeing 707.

00:38.710 --> 00:39.937
It's about 900 kilometers per hour.

00:40.170 --> 00:42.132
So, we've been on the plateau since 1958, indeed.

00:43.003 --> 00:47.972
Which, of course, shows what we have known for ages, and what economists refuse to accept...

00:48.079 --> 00:52.141
...that there cannot be indeterminate growth on a finite planet.

00:52.244 --> 00:54.939
But, you know, there is some efficiency.

00:55.069 --> 00:56.025
Lots of efficiency.

00:56.103 --> 00:59.377
Actually, these planes are 70 percent more efficient per passenger-kilometer,...

00:59.528 --> 01:01.379
...so this is underappreciated.

01:01.624 --> 01:05.455
The speed is the same but 70 percent less energy per passenger-kilometer.

01:05.656 --> 01:05.959
Amazing.

01:06.407 --> 01:09.920
So, it's a fascinating examination of all these functions and conditions...

01:10.003 --> 01:12.173
...and preconditions and consequences of growth.
