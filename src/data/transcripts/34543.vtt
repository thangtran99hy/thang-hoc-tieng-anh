00:05.712 --> 00:07.257
We are here with Yuzuru.

00:07.922 --> 00:09.015
Yuzuru, how are you?

00:09.097 --> 00:10.281
How did you feel today on the ice?

00:10.526 --> 00:10.800
Tired.

00:10.993 --> 00:11.845
It's hard,...

00:12.535 --> 00:20.551
...hard and feeling stronger and then harder again and then exhausted.

00:21.642 --> 00:22.565
At the end, exhausted.

00:23.975 --> 00:27.318
What do you bring home from this experience?

00:27.435 --> 00:28.863
Something to work on specifically?

00:29.166 --> 00:30.560
Especially for the quad lutz.

00:30.851 --> 00:33.096
I feel really good with music...

00:33.413 --> 00:35.635
...with the quad loop too.

00:35.998 --> 00:45.377
It really makes me happy to practice and bring it back.

00:48.507 --> 00:52.989
I think it is really an important step for me.

00:54.035 --> 01:00.252
And you have an amazing connection with your fans and with all the fans of figure skating.

01:00.611 --> 01:02.191
Did you feel it today?

01:02.281 --> 01:04.972
Did you feel it today on the ice, you tried to have it?

01:05.148 --> 01:08.781
Yeah, because when I was doing the quad loop, I'm feeling more...

01:11.389 --> 01:14.354
If I'm not doing quad lutz for the second jump,...

01:14.711 --> 01:16.585
...I feel really nervous for the quad loop.

01:18.238 --> 01:20.942
It was the most difficult jump.

01:21.413 --> 01:30.583
So, I think my fans, audience, have the nervous feeling for the quad loop,...

01:30.753 --> 01:36.149
...but today, I'm feeling a little lighter because I have more decision for the lutz.

01:36.415 --> 01:41.549
So I'm feeling a little lighter, "Okay, I can feel lighter for the loop."

01:41.683 --> 01:46.949
And when I'm doing a pattern for the lutz, my feet are much heavier.

01:48.907 --> 01:50.765
Everyone is nervous too.

01:51.051 --> 01:53.679
So, it's like a special moment for me.

01:55.123 --> 01:58.131
I feel a connection to the audience, you know.

01:58.879 --> 01:59.556
That's why I'm skating.

02:00.612 --> 02:01.289
Of course, of course.

02:01.365 --> 02:06.054
Well, thank you very much for your performances, for what you do in every competition for us.

02:06.335 --> 02:08.015
And good luck for the rest of the season.

02:08.219 --> 02:08.667
Thank you.
