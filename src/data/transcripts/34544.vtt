With the ninth pick in the 2019 NBA draft, the Washington Wizards select Rui Hachimura...

00:09.095 --> 00:12.852
...from Toyama, Japan and Gonzaga University.

00:15.741 --> 00:21.274
He's the 2nd player from Japan to be drafted and this is a huge deal culturally.

00:21.359 --> 00:25.906
There are 46 media members representing 23 outlets from Japan,...

00:26.289 --> 00:29.694
...and it's more than any other country besides the United States.

00:29.889 --> 00:31.583
His name means "baseball bases."

00:31.755 --> 00:33.981
Grandfather was a huge baseball fan.

00:34.236 --> 00:38.533
He came to Gonzaga barely speaking English, acclimated himself quickly...

00:38.643 --> 00:42.004
...but Mark you told me this week, he's such a polite guy,...

00:42.319 --> 00:46.089
...that he was flabbergasted early on by the fact that sometimes,...

00:46.546 --> 00:51.593
...his teammates would lie about fouls and the score in pickup games.

00:51.903 --> 00:53.319
Can you imagine that?

00:53.675 --> 00:54.342
Oh, wow.

00:54.432 --> 00:55.511
Imagine guys doing that.

00:55.919 --> 00:57.202
That's unbelievable.

00:57.853 --> 00:58.643
Definitely huge.

00:58.742 --> 01:01.895
Boy, what a season he had, averaged nearly 20 points per game.

01:01.971 --> 01:04.605
He's a very talented guy.

01:04.685 --> 01:06.064
He can do a lot of different things.

01:06.158 --> 01:07.747
He already has an endorsement deal...

01:08.241 --> 01:14.331
...that's been signed because of the excitement over his starting of his NBA career...

01:15.261 --> 01:16.569
...here in the United States.
