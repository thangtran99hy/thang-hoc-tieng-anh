Now I know at some point, we will have a memorial for Kobe.

00:06.790 --> 00:10.589
But I look at this as a celebration  tonight.

00:13.352 --> 00:19.381
This is a celebration of the 20 years of the blood, the sweat, the tears,...

00:20.119 --> 00:24.877
...the broken down body that getting up, sitting down to everyday in the countless hours.

00:25.775 --> 00:29.056
The determination to be as great as he could be.

00:29.730 --> 00:34.371
Tonight, we celebrate the kid that came here at 18 years of age.

00:38.885 --> 00:45.817
Retired at 38 and became probably the best daddy that we've seeing over the last three years, man.

00:50.435 --> 00:51.899
Tonight is a celebration.

00:53.863 --> 00:55.195
Before we get to play,...

00:56.896 --> 00:57.726
Love you all, man.

01:02.821 --> 01:08.546
Kobe is a brother to me and from the time I was in highschool,...

01:08.973 --> 01:10.219
...to watch him from afar.

01:11.703 --> 01:15.181
To get in this league at 18, watching him up close.

01:16.403 --> 01:19.039
All the battles we had throughout my career.

01:21.605 --> 01:25.121
The one thing that we always share is the determination to just want to win.

01:26.016 --> 01:27.393
I just want to be great.

01:29.289 --> 01:33.306
And the fact that I'm here now means so much to me.

01:34.642 --> 01:39.780
I want to continue along with my teammates to continue his legacy not only for this year...

01:41.009 --> 01:43.276
...but as long as we could play the game of basketball that we love...

01:43.370 --> 01:45.020
...because that's what Kobe Bryant will want.

01:55.347 --> 01:59.404
So in the words of Kobe Bryant, "Mamba out".

01:59.740 --> 02:02.848
But it the words of us, "Not forgotten".

02:03.086 --> 02:03.791
Live on brother.
