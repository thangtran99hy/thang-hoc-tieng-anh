00:03.753 --> 00:04.483
What's that?

00:04.675 --> 00:05.591
Reese's Take 5 bar.

00:05.690 --> 00:07.771
Chocolate, peanuts, caramel, peanut butter, pretzels.

00:07.877 --> 00:08.455
Never heard of it.

00:08.680 --> 00:09.122
Where have you been?

00:09.213 --> 00:09.815
Under a rock?

00:12.801 --> 00:13.663
New to me!

00:13.769 --> 00:14.837
What were you, born yesterday?

00:16.627 --> 00:17.392
Really, Trish?

00:17.575 --> 00:18.224
Me neither.

00:18.351 --> 00:19.229
Were you raised by wolves?

00:20.265 --> 00:21.514
Really insensitive, Trish.

00:21.837 --> 00:22.478
Are you clueless?

00:24.331 --> 00:25.169
Head in the sand?

00:25.555 --> 00:26.783
That's offensive, Trish.

00:26.874 --> 00:27.647
Yeah, Trish.

00:27.724 --> 00:28.837
You're from another planet?

00:31.525 --> 00:33.541
I've never heard of Take 5, neither.

00:34.081 --> 00:34.979
Again!

00:35.509 --> 00:36.275
Perfect, Trish,...

00:36.447 --> 00:38.302
...none of us have heard of Take 5.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.046
So who looks stupid now?

00:40.870 --> 00:42.144
Reese's Take 5.

00:42.347 --> 00:43.997
The best bar you've never heard of.
