00:00.100 --> 00:04.075
Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew...

00:04.641 --> 00:10.772
...that no people on earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans.

00:11.606 --> 00:13.723
If there is a mountain, we climb it.

00:14.495 --> 00:17.045
If there is a frontier, we cross it.

00:17.842 --> 00:19.527
If there's a challenge, we tame it.

00:20.553 --> 00:23.352
If there is an opportunity, we seize it.

00:23.597 --> 00:25.462
Americans love their country...

00:25.959 --> 00:31.317
...and they deserve a government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return.

00:31.808 --> 00:37.455
We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny...

00:38.150 --> 00:41.613
...and the same great American flag.
