00:00.507 --> 00:03.381
We fear the idea of personal change...

00:04.306 --> 00:07.565
...because we think that we have to sacrifice something to give something up.

00:07.971 --> 00:13.347
But human beings, at our best, are so inventive and creative and ingenious.

00:13.909 --> 00:20.669
And I think that when we use love and compassion as our guiding principles,...

00:21.310 --> 00:25.620
...we can create, develop and implement systems of change...

00:25.713 --> 00:28.733
...that are beneficial to all sentient beings and to the environment.

00:29.255 --> 00:30.832
I've been a scoundrel all my life.

00:31.507 --> 00:32.656
I have been selfish.

00:33.091 --> 00:37.330
I've been cruel at times, hard to work with and ungrateful.

00:37.769 --> 00:41.915
But, so many of you in this room have given me a second chance.

00:42.299 --> 00:44.564
And I think that's when we're at our best:...

00:45.968 --> 00:49.737
...when we support each other. Not when we cancel each other out for past mistakes,...

00:50.158 --> 00:53.133
...but when we help each other to grow, when we educate each other,...

00:53.215 --> 00:55.191
...when we guide each other towards redemption.

00:55.710 --> 00:57.411
That is the best of humanity.

00:57.961 --> 01:01.807
When he was 17, my brother wrote this lyric.

01:02.231 --> 01:06.695
He said, "Run to the rescue with love and peace will follow."

01:07.013 --> 01:07.403
Thank you.
