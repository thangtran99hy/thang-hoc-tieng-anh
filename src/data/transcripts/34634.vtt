Expect the worst, but look for the best.

00:04.829 --> 00:05.740
I'm a bit gobsmacked.

00:06.196 --> 00:08.480
I'm not one to look back, but this has made me do so,...

00:08.556 --> 00:10.725
...and I think of my folks taking me to the drive-in...

00:10.786 --> 00:14.417
...to see Butch and Sundance and loading up my car and moving out here,...

00:14.520 --> 00:18.989
...and Geena and Ridley giving me my first shot to all the wonderful people...

00:19.061 --> 00:21.649
...I've met along the way to stand here now.

00:22.664 --> 00:24.933
Once upon a time in Hollywood, I think that's the truth.
