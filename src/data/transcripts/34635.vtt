I am ready to drink tonight.

00:03.610 --> 00:08.058
Director Bong Joon-Ho sweeping the 92nd Academy Awards...

00:08.228 --> 00:12.775
...and hilariously showing us all that he clearly knows how to celebrate.

00:13.030 --> 00:17.248
The South Korean filmmaker walked away with 4 Academy Awards...

00:17.635 --> 00:18.991
Bong Joon-ho!

00:22.438 --> 00:29.439
...including Best Original Screenplay, Best International Feature Film, Best Director and Best Picture.

00:29.963 --> 00:33.099
And the Oscar goes to "Parasite."

00:36.345 --> 00:42.676
This is the first movie from South Korea to be nominated and to win the Oscar.

"Parasite."

00:54.076 --> 00:57.588
After winning Best International Feature, I thought I was done for the day...

00:57.661 --> 00:59.438
...and was ready to relax.

01:01.525 --> 01:04.680
And Todd and Sam, great directors I admire.

01:04.805 --> 01:08.056
If the Academy allows, I would like to get a Texas Chainsaw,...

01:08.523 --> 01:12.125
...split the Oscar trophy into five and share it with all of you.

01:12.562 --> 01:13.285
