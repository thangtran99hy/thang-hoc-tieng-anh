Chameleons are pretty famous for their color changing abilities.

00:05.306 --> 00:08.229
But do you know why they change their color?

00:09.373 --> 00:13.409
Well, they do this to regulate their body temperatures,...

00:14.260 --> 00:19.721
...hide from predators or to signal their intentions to other chameleons.

00:20.732 --> 00:24.057
There are several layers in a chameleon's skin.

00:24.465 --> 00:26.891
The outermost layer is transparent,...

00:27.285 --> 00:30.331
...beneath this layer there are a few more layers...

00:30.635 --> 00:33.495
...that contain a pigment called chromatophores...

00:34.188 --> 00:36.692
...which contain light reflecting cells.

00:37.061 --> 00:42.336
The chromatophores at each level are filled with sacs of different kinds of pigment.

00:42.764 --> 00:47.951
The deepest layer contains melanophores, which contain brown melanin.

00:48.314 --> 00:53.553
Melanin is the same pigment that gives different shades to the human skin.

00:53.913 --> 00:57.795
The layer above this, contains cells called iridophores,...

00:58.363 --> 01:03.204
...which contain a blue pigment that reflects blue and white light.

01:03.895 --> 01:08.507
Above this layer, there are cells called xanthophores and erythrophores...

01:08.714 --> 01:12.070
...which contain yellow and red pigments respectively.
