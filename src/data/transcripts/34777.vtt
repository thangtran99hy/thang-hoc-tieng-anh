Today, a star fell.

00:03.857 --> 00:04.899
It was almost like...

00:05.419 --> 00:07.215
Like seeing something out of a dream,...

00:07.611 --> 00:10.864
...nothing more or less than a breathtaking view.

00:26.994 --> 00:28.261
Want to hit the cafe later?

00:28.896 --> 00:30.376
Thanks, but I got to go to work.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.325
I can't stand this place anymore.

00:34.974 --> 00:36.751
It's too small and towny.

00:36.918 --> 00:40.407
Please make me a handsome Tokyo boy in my next life!

00:44.212 --> 00:45.123
Where?

00:46.063 --> 00:50.214
Now that you mention it, I do feel like I've been having weird dreams lately.

00:50.634 --> 00:53.103
I could dream about someone else's life?

00:53.518 --> 00:54.343
What is this?

00:56.787 --> 00:57.511
What is this?

00:58.394 --> 00:59.225
Could this mean?

00:59.864 --> 01:01.351
In our dreams, that girl and I...

01:02.029 --> 01:03.383
We're switching places?

01:09.475 --> 01:11.201
There's one thing I'm certain of.

01:12.291 --> 01:15.567
If we see each other, we'll definitely know right away.

01:16.308 --> 01:19.884
I was planning to tell you that wherever you are in the world,...

01:20.341 --> 01:22.964
...I swear that I'll find you again no matter what.

01:23.057 --> 01:24.025
Who are you?

01:24.105 --> 01:25.174
Who are you?

01:25.909 --> 01:28.034
Can I ask you your name?
