Hello, world.

00:01.746 --> 00:02.845
That was 2010.

00:03.553 --> 00:06.469
It's been ten years since my first tweet.

00:07.145 --> 00:07.433
Wait.

00:08.005 --> 00:09.475
Why is the camera so close?

00:11.965 --> 00:15.535
My seven favorite tweets of the past ten years.

00:15.965 --> 00:19.263
This might be the most mind-blowing fact I learned this year.

00:24.417 --> 00:28.893
I dumped ice water on my head to help raise awareness for ALS.

00:38.909 --> 00:42.864
I often say vaccines are one of the best health investments.

00:46.766 --> 00:50.194
There are few things I love talking about more than toilets.

00:52.235 --> 00:53.694
I hate mosquitoes.

00:54.297 --> 00:59.159
The diseases they spread kill more than half a million people every year.

00:59.841 --> 01:06.030
In fact, mosquitoes kill more people in one day than sharks kill in 100 years.

01:06.483 --> 01:11.884
I was touched when Melinda asked me to introduce her at her Moment of Lift book tour.

01:12.159 --> 01:12.546
Who?

01:14.132 --> 01:14.825
Oh, Bill.

01:15.102 --> 01:15.500
Right, right.

01:16.061 --> 01:16.809
Melinda's husband.

01:17.087 --> 01:20.031
This is the most beautiful chart in the world.

01:22.381 --> 01:26.131
Thank you Twitter for ten great years and here's to ten more.

01:27.424 --> 01:30.122
Still feels like the camera is super close.
