Kobe never left anything on the court.

00:05.515 --> 00:10.163
And I think that's what he would want for us to do.

00:11.829 --> 00:14.495
No one knows how much time we have.

00:16.058 --> 00:20.793
That's why we must live in the moment, we must enjoy the moment.

00:21.447 --> 00:27.133
We must reach and see and spend as much time as we can with our families and friends...

00:27.236 --> 00:28.872
...and the people that we absolutely love.

00:30.469 --> 00:37.001
To live in the moment means to enjoy each and everyone that we come in contact with.

00:39.681 --> 00:42.523
When Kobe Bryant died, a piece of me died.

00:44.760 --> 00:49.643
And as I look in this arena and across the globe, a piece of  of you died...

00:50.579 --> 00:51.823
...or else you wouldn't be here.

00:52.933 --> 00:56.869
Those are the memories that we have to live with and we learn from.

00:57.955 --> 01:03.027
I promise you from this day forward, I will live with the memories that knowing...

01:04.114 --> 01:08.168
...that I had a little brother that I tried to help in every way I could.

01:09.493 --> 01:11.787
Please, rest in peace, little brother.
