00:00.065 --> 00:04.827
Inside Japan's corporations, the culture emphasizes the success of a company as a whole...

00:05.093 --> 00:07.691
...to be more important than any single individual,...

00:07.917 --> 00:14.457
...which might explain why one study found that 63 percent of Japanese felt guilty for taking paid leave.

00:14.835 --> 00:16.861
But perhaps more concerning is this:...

00:16.979 --> 00:19.848
...Long work hours don't necessarily mean high productivity.

00:20.281 --> 00:24.397
In fact, Japan has the lowest productivity amongst the G7 nations.

00:24.547 --> 00:28.021
Earlier, I mentioned the term "karoshi"; it means death by overwork.

00:28.213 --> 00:30.029
It's legally recognized by the government...

00:30.159 --> 00:34.273
...and usually is marked by a heart attack, stroke or suicide due to stress.

00:34.481 --> 00:37.121
There's hundreds of cases of karoshi reported annually,...

00:37.402 --> 00:39.909
...although some argue these cases are underreported...

00:40.141 --> 00:43.608
...and that the real number could exceed that by up to ten times.
