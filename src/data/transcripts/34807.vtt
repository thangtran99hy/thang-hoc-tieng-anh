00:00.151 --> 00:01.667
Japan's economy is in danger.

00:01.805 --> 00:05.689
And in order to maintain its massive size, Japan needs to put in the hours.

00:05.817 --> 00:10.485
Japan lost its spot as the world's second-largest economy to China in 2011,...

00:10.869 --> 00:14.307
...a title that it had previously held for 42 years.

00:14.441 --> 00:16.385
Japan is dealing with a labor crisis.

00:16.605 --> 00:20.097
Its population is aging fast and its birth rate is in decline.

00:20.654 --> 00:23.427
That means its total population is going down.

00:23.765 --> 00:27.334
And in the next 50 years, it's projected to shrink by nearly a third.

00:27.581 --> 00:34.653
The population is expected to go from 127 million in 2015, to just 88 million by 2065.

00:35.241 --> 00:38.554
There's two likely ways that a nation can compensate for the labor shortage,...

00:38.999 --> 00:40.664
...immigrants or robots.

00:40.751 --> 00:43.849
Japan has always been less inclined to accept immigrants.

00:44.180 --> 00:46.919
In fact, its percentage of foreign workers is tiny...

00:47.004 --> 00:49.201
...compared to other nations of large economies.

00:49.341 --> 00:53.157
So without more immigrants, it's looking to robotics to fill in the gap.
