00:00.810 --> 00:10.714
And the Game of the Year award goes to Sekiro.

00:16.623 --> 00:22.090
Tonight, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice also wins best action-adventure game.

00:31.505 --> 00:32.629
He's very moved.

00:49.361 --> 00:53.727
So, Sekiro has a lot of difficult and complex elements...

00:53.825 --> 00:57.807
...that made us a little unsure when it was about to come out...

00:57.958 --> 01:03.281
...and we were both surprised and overjoyed at the reaction that we saw.

01:13.951 --> 01:18.549
So I'd like to share the joy of receiving this award with the staff at FromSoftware...

01:18.825 --> 01:20.509
...who pulled out all the stops to make it happen,...

01:20.827 --> 01:23.911
...as well as the team in Activision for their ongoing support throughout.

01:44.477 --> 01:48.204
And finally, I'd like to give out a huge thank you to our players.

01:49.803 --> 01:52.473
We couldn't have done it without you and it was a huge honor to make.

01:52.612 --> 01:56.375
So we will continue to try and make the best games as we possibly can.
