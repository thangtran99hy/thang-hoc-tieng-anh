Coronaviradae are actually an entire family of viruses...

00:04.285 --> 00:06.676
...that cause disease in mammals and birds.

00:06.879 --> 00:09.828
SARS for example was also a coronavirus.

00:10.167 --> 00:12.080
Now, viruses are interesting...

00:12.168 --> 00:16.834
...in that they are sometimes considered both living and nonliving things.

00:17.075 --> 00:20.437
They aren't made of cells, but they do have the ability to replicate,...

00:20.743 --> 00:22.913
...just in a different way than other organisms.

00:23.170 --> 00:26.230
Oh, and they're actually much, much smaller than cells.

00:26.402 --> 00:27.752
Now, to contract the coronavirus,...

00:27.915 --> 00:29.949
...you first have to come in contact with it,...

00:30.205 --> 00:32.976
...either through an infected person's respiratory secretions...

00:33.037 --> 00:36.203
...so a cough or a sneeze, through physical contact with them...

00:36.336 --> 00:39.481
...or by physically touching a surface that the virus is on...

00:39.785 --> 00:43.072
...and then touching somewhere like your nose or your mouth before washing your hands.

00:43.212 --> 00:44.523
In the case of the coronavirus,...

00:44.601 --> 00:49.595
...these symptoms include headaches, runny nose, coughing, sore throat and fever,...

00:49.735 --> 00:52.437
...which is part of the reason why it's been so hard to track and understand...

00:52.536 --> 00:56.458
...because those are common symptoms, we feel those all the time, specially during flu season...

00:56.695 --> 00:58.042
...or just from getting the common cold.

00:58.153 --> 01:02.321
Medical professionals would need to do laboratory tests on respiratory specimens...

01:02.444 --> 01:04.848
...as well as blood work and blood tests...

01:05.103 --> 01:08.939
...to understand if your symptoms are coming from the Wuhan coronavirus.

01:09.165 --> 01:10.421
In a healthy individual,...

01:10.520 --> 01:14.953
...the immune system will eventually realize that there's a foreign agent inside your body...

01:15.269 --> 01:16.667
...and mount an attack.

01:16.924 --> 01:20.965
The immune system is incredibly complex with a plethora of different mechanisms...

01:21.040 --> 01:22.065
...to take down your invaders.

01:22.297 --> 01:25.321
Your temperature increases which helps your immune system function better...

01:25.417 --> 01:28.439
...and actually makes it a more hostile environment for the virus.

01:28.776 --> 01:30.913
You might create more snot and phlegm,...

01:31.076 --> 01:33.975
...which make it harder for the virus to attach to your cells...

01:34.080 --> 01:37.870
...and also help to get rid of dead viruses and immune cells.

01:37.949 --> 01:42.147
You may feel weak and tired as your body starts to prioritize fighting off this virus...

01:42.245 --> 01:44.599
...instead of doing your regular day-to-day activities.

01:44.875 --> 01:47.507
And your bones may actually feel sore and ache...

01:47.779 --> 01:50.653
...and that's because they're actually making more white blood cells.
