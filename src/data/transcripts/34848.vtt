My fellow Americans, tonight I want to speak with you...

00:04.595 --> 00:11.100
...about our nation's unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China...

00:11.205 --> 00:12.997
...and is now spreading throughout the world.

00:14.083 --> 00:20.201
Today, the World Health Organization officially announced that this is a global pandemic.

00:21.099 --> 00:23.770
We have been in frequent contact with our allies...

00:23.890 --> 00:28.315
...and we are marshaling the full power of the federal government and the private sector...

00:28.415 --> 00:30.356
...to protect the American people.

00:31.383 --> 00:36.927
This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history.

00:37.702 --> 00:43.141
I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures,...

00:43.503 --> 00:47.043
....we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens...

00:47.423 --> 00:51.199
...and we'll ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus.

00:51.613 --> 00:57.267
At the very start of the outbreak, we instituted sweeping travel restrictions on China...

00:57.777 --> 01:02.955
...and put in place the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years.

01:03.757 --> 01:06.385
We declared a public health emergency...

01:06.678 --> 01:11.179
...and issued the highest level of travel warning on other countries...

01:11.353 --> 01:14.642
...as the virus spread its horrible infection.

01:15.882 --> 01:22.311
The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots.

01:22.884 --> 01:29.846
As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.

01:30.393 --> 01:33.699
After consulting with our top government health professionals,...

01:34.023 --> 01:37.434
...I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions...

01:37.505 --> 01:41.345
...to protect the health and well-being of all Americans.

01:41.920 --> 01:44.705
To keep new cases from entering our shores,...

01:45.073 --> 01:50.907
...we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days.

01:51.629 --> 01:54.912
The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight.
