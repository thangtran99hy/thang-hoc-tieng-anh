00:00.272 --> 00:03.439
The NBA has now announced the suspension of their season.

00:04.733 --> 00:06.695
I'm just gonna read you their press release.

00:07.513 --> 00:12.671
The NBA announced that a player on the Utah Jazz has preliminarily tested positive for COVID-19.

00:13.043 --> 00:14.422
The test result was reported shortly...

00:14.509 --> 00:18.041
...prior to the tip-off of tonight's game between the Jazz and the Oklahoma City Thunder...

00:18.203 --> 00:20.226
...at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma.

00:20.681 --> 00:22.557
At that time, tonight's game was cancelled.

00:22.655 --> 00:25.052
The affected player was not in the arena.

00:25.529 --> 00:27.031
The NBA is suspending gameplay...

00:27.159 --> 00:30.253
...following the conclusion of tonight's schedule of games until further notice.

00:30.627 --> 00:33.198
The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps...

00:33.368 --> 00:36.514
...for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic.

00:36.601 --> 00:40.902
So again, moments ago, we had heard that game had been delayed and then called off.

00:41.231 --> 00:42.821
We now know why it was.

00:42.905 --> 00:45.607
Again, a Utah Jazz player has preliminarily tested positive.

00:45.885 --> 00:48.551
That game is off tonight; the NBA season has been suspended.
