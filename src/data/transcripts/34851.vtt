This isn't dough, it's ice cream.

00:04.811 --> 00:09.097
And yet it's chewy, stretchy, doesn't melt like regular ice cream...

00:09.625 --> 00:13.309
...and it's often cut with a butcher's knife instead of scooped.

It's called maras dondurma and it's an old family tradition here in Turkey.

00:19.167 --> 00:25.080
Located at the foot of the Ahir mountains, Kahramanmaras is Turkey's ice cream capital.

Maras ice cream has three main ingredients...

00:34.477 --> 00:37.980
...that contribute to its distinguishing features and taste.

00:38.719 --> 00:40.213
The first is the milk.

00:41.156 --> 00:43.425
The second ingredient is the sweetener.

00:44.002 --> 00:47.140
But the third ingredient is where the real magic happens.

00:47.564 --> 00:51.869
In addition to the salep, hand churning the ice cream is crucial.
