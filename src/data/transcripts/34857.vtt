So today, when you look at personal protective equipment for microbial risk such as coronavirus,...

00:06.216 --> 00:07.470
...you're looking at four items.

00:07.569 --> 00:12.057
And they would be a face shield, followed by a respirator of some sort...

00:12.327 --> 00:17.025
...followed by a disposable coverall and finally gloves.

00:19.013 --> 00:23.115
Coveralls, face shields, goggles and gloves protect against hazards like Ebola...

00:23.419 --> 00:26.069
...that can spread by direct contact with bodily fluids.

00:26.658 --> 00:29.879
The respirator prevents inhaling droplets in the air from sneezes and coughs.

00:30.445 --> 00:34.957
Healthcare workers wear respirators while treating patients during the SARS and MERS outbreaks.

00:35.895 --> 00:39.887
While both respirators and surgical masks are effective at filtering out large droplets,...

00:40.249 --> 00:43.271
...surgical mask are less effective at filtering out smaller droplets...

00:43.381 --> 00:45.609
...which can be inhaled through the sides of the masks.
