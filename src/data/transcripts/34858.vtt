Yeah.

00:58.837 --> 01:00.733
I would make them work a lot.

01:01.169 --> 01:03.235
Are you willing to relocate?

01:03.549 --> 01:05.538
Yeah, I'm kinda thinking about it.

01:05.935 --> 01:07.459
Are you looking for equity?

01:08.405 --> 01:09.056
A lot.

01:09.208 --> 01:09.666
A lot?

01:10.009 --> 01:10.472

A year, yeah.

01:26.703 --> 01:27.001
Great.

01:27.518 --> 01:29.344
Do you have any questions for me?

01:30.901 --> 01:32.935
What is your salary for your job?

01:34.015 --> 01:37.372
I'll answer that one for you because it could be more, it could be more.
