Opening up these coffins and photographing them...

00:03.797 --> 00:06.522
...has been something we've wanted to do for a long, long time.

00:06.817 --> 00:10.693
These have been in vitrines, and they've only received some sporadic attention.

00:10.964 --> 00:13.896
Thanks to a generous grant from the dean's competitive fund,...

00:14.219 --> 00:16.181
...we've been able to open up the vitrines...

00:16.382 --> 00:21.210
...and assemble an all-star cast of conservators, professional photographers,...

00:21.382 --> 00:25.115
...pigment sampling and residue and wood analysis experts.

00:25.467 --> 00:28.426
They've come from as far away as University College in London...

00:28.687 --> 00:31.384
...and from our own Strauss Center here at the Harvard Art Museum.

00:31.792 --> 00:36.251
And so, we're trying to do everything we can in the way of documentation and study.

00:39.617 --> 00:44.559
These coffins come from Thebes, modern Luxor, several hundred miles south of Cairo.

00:44.813 --> 00:47.089
There are no bodies, no mummies, in any of the three.

00:47.217 --> 00:50.861
The other two are wooden coffins with beautiful painted decorations.

00:51.243 --> 00:55.859
So, they belong to Pa-di-mut, to Ankh Kohnsu and Mut iy-iy,...

00:56.116 --> 00:57.767
...two men and one woman.

00:59.291 --> 01:04.125
We knew we had to proceed very carefully and slowly with lifting the lids of the coffins.

01:07.940 --> 01:12.319
This research has a two-fold implication, where we're creating models...

01:12.527 --> 01:17.247
...for researchers, for scholars and also for visitors to a museum,...

01:17.465 --> 01:19.743
...and you can use them as teaching tools.

01:19.929 --> 01:23.725
This project ties into our general mission here at the museum,...

01:23.951 --> 01:25.977
...which is to enhance our teaching collection...

01:26.445 --> 01:28.281
...with all kinds of new technologies.
