Hello, everyone.

00:01.669 --> 00:07.377
In one way or another, the spread of COVID-19 is forcing all of us to change our daily routines.

00:07.907 --> 00:12.982
That might mean working from home or it might mean planning how to close your business temporarily.

00:13.667 --> 00:18.988
Many of you are worried about your jobs, about paying the bills or taking care of your kids.

00:19.662 --> 00:21.445
But know that we've got your back.

00:22.061 --> 00:26.262
We've already announced a whole range of measures to protect jobs and the economy.

00:26.721 --> 00:30.503
From new rules on employment insurance to financing for businesses.

00:30.979 --> 00:38.787
And today, we launched a 27-billion-dollar plan to help all Canadians get through these challenging and exceptional times.

00:39.623 --> 00:43.509
Across the country, people like you are reaching out to support each other.

00:44.089 --> 00:45.737
You know we're in this together.

00:46.327 --> 00:50.584
Together, we can make sure that everyone has the support they need.

00:51.988 --> 00:53.194
This isn't an easy time.

00:53.871 --> 00:55.167
But it's going to get better.

00:55.482 --> 00:58.763
And until it does, let's just focus on the steps ahead.

00:59.402 --> 01:02.201
Stay home to protect your health and your family's health,...

01:02.573 --> 01:05.339
...but also to lift the load on our doctors and nurses.

01:05.653 --> 01:11.171
And make sure that you're taking time for yourself to rest and do what you need to stay positive.

01:11.995 --> 01:14.331
For a little while, this will be our new normal...

01:14.855 --> 01:17.823
...and that's okay because we are in it together.
