00:00.255 --> 00:06.002
The WHO are not recommending travel restrictions and that's based on past experience.

00:06.150 --> 00:09.011
It's doubtful whether there's any public health benefit to that,...

00:09.231 --> 00:13.139
...but it's interesting we have this somewhat of a disconnect between what the WHO is recommending...

00:13.257 --> 00:15.067
...and what many, many governments are doing...

00:15.186 --> 00:17.609
...and particularly where you have very broad restrictions...

00:17.720 --> 00:19.789
...based on simply the passport you're carrying.

00:19.928 --> 00:23.160
Governments are thinking of the readiness of their own health systems,...

00:23.295 --> 00:26.215
...signals they're sending to the public, are they seen to be doing enough...

00:26.360 --> 00:30.407
...and whether that's for a public health reason or whether it's politically driven.

00:34.445 --> 00:36.569
The benefits of arrival screening are doubtful.

00:36.843 --> 00:41.364
We learned from SARS and other events that arrival screening is not effective.

00:41.515 --> 00:43.948
Exit screening, there is a role for exit screening,...

00:44.178 --> 00:45.796
...preventing sick people traveling,...

00:45.893 --> 00:47.831
...preventing sick people from getting onto an aircraft...

00:47.919 --> 00:49.324
...and other forms of transport.

00:54.895 --> 00:56.425
So, being on board an aircraft...

00:56.533 --> 00:59.033
...is no different to being in some other conveyance,...

00:59.097 --> 01:01.116
...or in a meeting in a room or something like that.

01:01.211 --> 01:04.887
The filtering systems and the air circulation systems on an aircraft...

01:05.062 --> 01:08.400
...are comparable to an operating theater in a hospital environment...

01:08.508 --> 01:11.753
...and from a health perspective, it's also safe.

01:11.856 --> 01:15.243
So, those fears are unfounded, but people do have that anxiety.

01:15.384 --> 01:17.244
One of these is, of course, is you can't get off.

01:21.007 --> 01:25.831
It's very important to get back to the basics of what is the advice to the traveler, well, the traveling public,...

01:25.898 --> 01:27.977
...what's the advice to the public, and it's very simple things,...

01:28.271 --> 01:32.309
...which is hand washing, avoiding contamination...

01:32.441 --> 01:35.551
...from your hands to your nose, mouth or eyes.
