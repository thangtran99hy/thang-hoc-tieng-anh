Well, many people are avoiding traveling right now,...

00:03.167 --> 00:05.354
...but if you still need to get on a plane for some reason,...

00:05.453 --> 00:09.709
...some seats are more likely to keep you from getting sick.

00:10.191 --> 00:14.279
The enclosed space, recirculated air and the number of people...

00:14.484 --> 00:17.177
...make planes prime breeding grounds for bacteria.

00:17.281 --> 00:21.452
The tray table was by far the most contaminated surface tested.

00:21.823 --> 00:25.989
It was followed by the overhead air vent, the lavatory flush button...

00:26.221 --> 00:27.919
...and the seatbelt buckle.

00:28.393 --> 00:33.117
So what could travelers do to help fend off illness above cruising altitude?

00:33.222 --> 00:36.594
Well, carry antibacterial wipes and hand sanitizers,...

00:36.888 --> 00:41.782
...wipe down that tray table, seatbelt buckles, armrest and seat back pockets...

00:41.910 --> 00:42.809
...when you sit down.

00:43.228 --> 00:45.152
Hydrate and choose a window seat.

00:45.222 --> 00:49.148
In fact, people who sit by the window have the smallest risk of infection...

00:49.226 --> 00:52.101
...because they have the least contact with others.
