Bitcoin is a fully digital currency.

00:02.074 --> 00:05.714
You can exchange bitcoins between computers in a worldwide peer-to-peer network.

00:05.865 --> 00:08.351
The whole point of most peer-to-peer networks is sharing stuff,...

00:08.477 --> 00:12.777
...like letting people make copies of super legal music or movies to download.

00:12.917 --> 00:14.631
If bitcoin is a digital currency,...

00:14.971 --> 00:18.754
...what's stopping you from making a bunch of counterfeit copies and becoming fabulously wealthy?

00:18.909 --> 00:21.027
Well, unlike an MP3 or a video file,...

00:21.125 --> 00:23.619
...a bitcoin isn't a string of data that can be duplicated.

00:23.754 --> 00:28.143
A bitcoin is actually an entry on a huge, global ledger called the blockchain,..

00:28.379 --> 00:29.492
...for reasons we'll get to in a minute.

00:29.604 --> 00:33.565
The blockchain records every bitcoin transaction that has ever happened.

00:33.811 --> 00:38.675
And, as of late 2016, the complete ledger is about 107 gigabytes of data.

00:38.771 --> 00:42.299
So, when you send someone bitcoins, it's not like you're sending them a bunch of files.

00:42.534 --> 00:45.958
Instead, you're basically writing the exchange down on that big ledger,...

00:46.049 --> 00:48.455
...something like, "Michael sends Hank five bitcoins."

00:48.561 --> 00:50.136
Now, maybe you're thinking, "But, wait."

00:50.351 --> 00:53.486
"You said that bitcoin doesn't have a central authority to keep track of everything!"

00:53.614 --> 00:56.917
Even though the blockchain is a central record, there's no official group of people...

00:56.989 --> 01:00.061
...who update the ledger and keep track of everybody's money like a bank does.

01:00.283 --> 01:01.417
It's decentralized.

01:01.525 --> 01:05.944
In fact, anybody can volunteer to keep the blockchain up to date with all the new transactions...

01:06.129 --> 01:07.119
...and a ton of people do.

01:07.215 --> 01:10.213
It all works because there are lots of people keeping track of the same thing...

01:10.345 --> 01:12.205
...to make sure all transactions are accurate.
