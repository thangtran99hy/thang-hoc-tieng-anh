Just like a real cat, MarsCat is fully autonomous.

00:05.197 --> 00:14.440
You can see it walking, running, sitting, stretching, tapping and even burying litter.

00:15.079 --> 00:19.525
It may express different emotions by different meows or gestures.

00:20.467 --> 00:24.617
MarsCat can play with you or your toys because it can feel, ...

00:25.409 --> 00:25.727
...hear, ...

00:25.887 --> 00:26.949
"Mars, go to sleep."

00:27.963 --> 00:29.140
...and see.

00:30.318 --> 00:33.137
It can interact with objects or people nearby.

00:33.660 --> 00:35.790
Even play with real cats.

00:36.297 --> 00:38.243
It feels with purr sounds.

00:38.728 --> 00:43.765
Every MarsCat is unique, from its eyes, body to personality.

00:44.121 --> 00:47.481
You can pet it and shape its characters in your own way.

00:48.117 --> 00:50.617
Dress it up, make it more adorable.

00:52.315 --> 00:58.047
MarsCat is open-source and programmable with powerful quad-core Raspberry Pi.

00:58.297 --> 01:00.561
You can create your own applications.

01:01.201 --> 01:07.254
MarsCat is also an ideal choice for education, research and commercial purpose.

01:08.427 --> 01:14.473
Batteries last for around three hours for active reactions or six hours for regular motions.

01:15.641 --> 01:19.653
