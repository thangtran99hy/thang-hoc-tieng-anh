The biggest reason why Freedom and Responsibility drives the success of Netflix...

00:05.083 --> 00:08.262
...is it encourages us all to be big risk takers.

00:08.479 --> 00:10.311
So, what does Freedom and Responsibility mean to me?

00:10.457 --> 00:11.135
It means three things.

00:11.257 --> 00:12.515
One, there's trust.

00:12.734 --> 00:17.137
I'm being trusted to make the right decisions in the best interest of Netflix.

00:17.303 --> 00:19.010
Number two is self-discipline.

00:19.222 --> 00:23.713
I have the self-discipline to exercise good due diligence and good judgement.

00:23.911 --> 00:25.423
And the third thing is accountability.

00:25.686 --> 00:28.680
I'm accountable for the outcomes of my decisions.
