00:02.500 --> 00:06.992
I'm speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time.

00:08.098 --> 00:10.875
A time of disruption in the life of our country.

00:11.861 --> 00:17.346
A disruption that has brought grief to some, financial difficulties to many...

00:17.906 --> 00:21.115
...and enormous changes to the daily lives of us all.

00:22.772 --> 00:28.403
I want to thank everyone on the NHS frontline, as well as care workers...

00:28.663 --> 00:31.237
...and those carrying out essential roles...

00:31.863 --> 00:36.544
...who selflessly continue their day-to-day duties outside the home...

00:37.095 --> 00:38.909
...in support of us all.

00:40.181 --> 00:45.642
I'm sure the nation will join me in assuring you that what you do is appreciated,...

00:46.037 --> 00:52.455
...and every hour of your hard work brings us closer to a return to more normal times.

00:53.986 --> 00:57.666
I also want to thank those of you who are staying at home,...

00:58.591 --> 01:00.828
...thereby helping to protect the vulnerable,..

01:01.461 --> 01:07.140
...and sparing many families the pain already felt by those who have lost loved ones.

01:08.995 --> 01:11.465
Together we are tackling this disease,..

01:12.137 --> 01:18.355
...and I want to reassure you that, if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it.

01:20.547 --> 01:24.585
I hope, in the years to come, everyone will be able to take pride...

01:24.738 --> 01:27.284
...in how they responded to this challenge.

01:28.159 --> 01:33.778
And those who come after us will say the Britons of this generation were as strong as any.

01:34.896 --> 01:37.413
That the attributes of self-discipline,...

01:37.945 --> 01:44.025
...of quiet, good-humored resolve and of fellow feeling still characterize this country.

01:45.841 --> 01:53.569
The pride in who we are is not a part of our past, it defines our present and our future.
