The moments when the United Kingdom has come together..

00:03.704 --> 00:06.185
...to applaud its care and essential workers...

00:06.811 --> 00:10.562
...will be remembered as an expression of our national spirit;...

00:11.650 --> 00:15.125
...and its symbol will be the rainbows drawn by children.

00:18.733 --> 00:21.192
Across the Commonwealth and around the world,...

00:21.756 --> 00:26.234
...we have seen heartwarming stories of people coming together to help others,...

00:26.975 --> 00:32.231
...be it through delivering food parcels and medicines, checking on neighbors,...

00:32.763 --> 00:36.147
...or converting businesses to help the relief effort.

00:38.021 --> 00:40.825
And though self-isolating may at times be hard,...

00:41.680 --> 00:44.599
...many people of all faiths, and of none,...

00:45.047 --> 00:49.407
...are discovering that it presents an opportunity to slow down,...

00:50.097 --> 00:53.471
...pause and reflect, in prayer or meditation.

00:55.594 --> 01:02.071
It reminds me of the very first broadcast I made, in 1940, helped by my sister.

01:03.217 --> 01:06.057
We, as children, spoke from here at Windsor...

01:06.488 --> 01:12.072
...to children who had been evacuated from their homes and sent away for their own safety.

01:13.312 --> 01:19.724
Today, once again, many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones.

01:21.133 --> 01:26.579
But now, as then, we know, deep down, that it is the right thing to do.

01:28.531 --> 01:32.994
While we have faced challenges before, this one is different.

01:34.211 --> 01:38.986
This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavor,..

01:39.972 --> 01:46.049
...using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal.

01:47.638 --> 01:52.509
We will succeed - and that success will belong to every one of us.

01:53.939 --> 02:00.143
We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return:..

02:01.327 --> 02:08.221
...we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.

02:09.337 --> 02:13.665
But for now, I send my thanks and warmest good wishes to you all.
