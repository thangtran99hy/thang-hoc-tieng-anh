Nestled in the quaint mountains above Hiroshima,...

00:10.205 --> 00:15.232
...Maruni Wood Industry is a furniture manufacturer eight years shy of its centennial.

00:16.280 --> 00:20.767
Maruni made its name in Japan by producing well-crafted traditional furniture.

00:21.035 --> 00:25.101
And now, it's contemporary pieces also grace well-appointed galleries,...

00:25.373 --> 00:27.769
...offices and restaurants around the world.

00:28.425 --> 00:33.994
Maybe all the Japanese children are told, "God is always looking at you."

00:34.179 --> 00:43.696
So, even though people never touch here, our craftsmen sand and finish it very carefully.

00:44.475 --> 00:52.661
That kind of mindset or that kind of mentality comes from this God island, Miyajima.

00:54.621 --> 00:57.747
When the family called Takeshi to return to his hometown,...

00:57.906 --> 01:01.571
...he knew that getting the company back on track will be no easy task.

01:01.989 --> 01:05.391
Maruni was experiencing the most difficult period in its history,...

01:05.651 --> 01:08.202
...and the challenge was not only finding a solution,...

01:08.503 --> 01:12.107
...but also convincing the rest of the family that this is the right way forward.

01:13.905 --> 01:15.991
Of course, we want big sales,...

01:16.349 --> 01:18.333
...but we don't follow sales.

01:18.593 --> 01:22.661
We follow quality or we follow what we want to make.

01:23.259 --> 01:28.843
Continuity is more important than big success or big sales, I think.

01:29.229 --> 01:38.529
So, if we keep that kind of thinking, our company is needed in this society.

01:41.213 --> 01:47.572
I am Yamanaka-san, so working for Maruni is my destiny.
