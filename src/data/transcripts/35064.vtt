When something is stored in the cloud,...

00:02.605 --> 00:06.287
...that means it's stored on internet servers instead of on your computer.

00:07.516 --> 00:09.381
It's like having an extra hard drive,...

00:10.060 --> 00:14.229
...one that you can access anywhere and anytime you're connected to the internet.

00:15.953 --> 00:20.445
In the past, you only had a home computer and the software you installed on it.

00:22.276 --> 00:27.115
Now you can take your files anywhere thanks to cloud-based applications called web apps,...

00:27.309 --> 00:29.184
...which run inside your internet browser.

00:30.266 --> 00:33.701
A web app that you may already use is Google Docs.

00:34.305 --> 00:35.061
It's free.

00:35.521 --> 00:37.819
You don't have to install anything to use it,...

00:38.149 --> 00:41.640
...and it allows you to create several different types of projects.

00:42.631 --> 00:45.577
You can access everything that you create in Google Docs...

00:45.645 --> 00:48.471
...from any computer or device with an internet connection.

00:50.109 --> 00:53.532
Since you only need a connected device  to access the cloud,...

00:53.975 --> 00:58.611
...you can take your music, photos and videos with you wherever you go.
