And by now, this is a pretty standard modern-day fairy tale of girl posting on the internet,...

00:18.655 --> 00:20.678
...the internet takes the girl by storm,...

00:21.175 --> 00:25.644
...thousands of men voyage into the comment sections to ask for her hand in marriage.

00:26.342 --> 00:30.674
She ignores all of them, starts a YouTube channel and keeps on building robots.

00:31.658 --> 00:37.597
Since then, I've carved out this little niche for myself on the internet as an inventor of useless machines,...

00:38.037 --> 00:45.477
...because as we all know, the easiest way to be at the top of your field is to choose a very small field.

00:52.188 --> 00:53.421
I'm not an engineer.

00:53.498 --> 00:55.682
I did not study engineering in school.

00:56.042 --> 00:59.273
But, I was a super ambitious student growing up.

00:59.553 --> 01:01.961
In middle school and high school, I had straight A's,...

01:02.080 --> 01:03.968
...and I graduated at the top of my year.

01:04.355 --> 01:08.747
On the flip side of that, I struggled with very severe performance anxiety.

01:09.916 --> 01:13.079
And no, I did not accidentally burn our parents' house down.

01:13.545 --> 01:17.539
The thing I'm writing about in the email and the thing I'm so upset about...

01:17.900 --> 01:20.097
...is that I got a B on a math test.

01:21.471 --> 01:24.347
So, something obviously happened between here and here.

01:29.799 --> 01:31.806
One of those things was puberty.

01:33.392 --> 01:34.610
Beautiful time indeed.

01:34.901 --> 01:38.377
But moreover, I got interested in building robots,...

01:38.517 --> 01:41.098
...and I wanted to teach myself about hardware.

01:41.770 --> 01:44.532
But, building things with hardware, especially if you're teaching yourself,...

01:44.817 --> 01:47.219
...is something that's really difficult to do.

01:47.686 --> 01:49.353
It has a high likelihood of failure...

01:49.579 --> 01:53.239
...and moreover, it has a high likelihood of making you feel stupid.

01:53.589 --> 01:55.621
And that was my biggest fear at the time.
