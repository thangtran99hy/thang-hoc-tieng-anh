00:00.119 --> 00:01.337
I have 80 apartments.

00:01.462 --> 00:04.431
I have quite several buildings close to 200 tenants.

00:04.546 --> 00:05.744
You built up quite an empire.

00:06.069 --> 00:08.926
Yes, I built these with my own hands.

00:09.661 --> 00:12.024
And recognizing that so many of his tenants...

00:12.092 --> 00:15.037
...had been hit financially because of the coronavirus,...

00:15.508 --> 00:18.371
...he decided to waive the rent for the month of April.

00:18.842 --> 00:23.225
Mario, what made you decide to waive the rent for all your 200 tenants?

00:23.412 --> 00:27.275
Because I had a lot of my tenants losing their jobs.

00:27.513 --> 00:33.310
I wanted them to have some peace of mind, not to worry about where their next dollar was.

00:33.697 --> 00:37.588
As a human, I felt a lot more comfortable...

00:37.874 --> 00:43.165
...making sure that they had food on their table, with several of them didn't...

00:43.728 --> 00:46.647
...and I felt very honored to tell them that.

00:46.831 --> 00:49.773
But presumably, you're taking a hard hit on this financially.

00:49.855 --> 00:50.615
How much are you losing?

00:50.803 --> 00:52.979
We don't want to really bring that issue up.

00:53.159 --> 00:55.868
That's irrelevant to the value of human life,...

00:56.673 --> 00:59.111
...and which I value people's lives.

00:59.841 --> 01:02.370
I left the big sign right here on the door.

01:02.797 --> 01:05.869
I told, very important, all the tenants to stay safe,...

01:06.506 --> 01:09.074
...help your neighbors and wash your hands.

01:09.689 --> 01:14.552
Most of his tenants are young and many have recently lost their jobs.

01:14.885 --> 01:17.746
It was really wonderful and I really needed it and it's helping me.

01:17.839 --> 01:21.493
It's gonna make it a lot easier and a lot better and a lot less stressed out.

01:21.653 --> 01:25.537
Mario is like one of the genuinely nicest people I've ever met.

01:25.873 --> 01:27.532
Is it a help at a time like this?

01:27.931 --> 01:28.463
For everybody.

01:28.566 --> 01:29.475
For everybody, yeah.

01:30.308 --> 01:32.465
I don't really look at it as being a hero.

01:32.655 --> 01:34.375
I look at it as being human.

01:34.899 --> 01:38.491
So, if I could make it easier on someone's life,...

01:38.726 --> 01:39.727
...just pass it on.

01:42.373 --> 01:46.251
Mario's selfless act as a landlord is sure to hit him financially,...

01:46.329 --> 01:49.678
...but he says, if it helps his tenants, he really doesn't mind it.

01:49.813 --> 01:53.915
It's a kind act and for many, needed now more than ever.
