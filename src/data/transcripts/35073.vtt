Big Tech has its eyes set on your wallet.

00:03.825 --> 00:04.903
Apple has a credit card.

00:05.729 --> 00:08.082
Facebook is trying to introduce its own currency.

00:08.657 --> 00:11.003
And Google has plans to offer checking accounts...

00:11.155 --> 00:13.568
...to users of its digital wallet in 2020.

00:14.670 --> 00:16.680
So, tech firms are offering services...

00:16.839 --> 00:19.923
...that are usually associated with banks, but they're doing it differently.

00:20.291 --> 00:21.301
It's really about data.

00:21.485 --> 00:24.395
When a company like Apple or Google processes a payment for you,...

00:24.529 --> 00:25.988
...they find out a lot about you.

00:26.339 --> 00:28.103
They know what you bought, where you bought it,...

00:28.347 --> 00:29.948
...what time of the day or what day of the month...

00:30.055 --> 00:33.441
...you're likely to spend money and that's really valuable information for advertisers.

00:34.301 --> 00:37.720
Also, banking is another way for tech firms to draw customers...

00:37.853 --> 00:39.338
...further into their universes.

00:39.938 --> 00:42.704
So, Facebook started out as a way to talk to your friends,...

00:42.942 --> 00:45.981
...and then became a place you shared baby photos with your grandparents.

00:46.215 --> 00:47.963
And now you can shop on Facebook properties,...

00:48.047 --> 00:50.415
...you can message, Instagram, WhatsApp.

00:51.076 --> 00:52.325
Amazon is the same way.

00:52.415 --> 00:55.653
It started out as a big store, and now they make home speakers,...

00:55.791 --> 00:57.852
...they make original movies and television shows.

00:58.112 --> 01:00.323
So, these companies all started off with one thing...

01:00.555 --> 01:02.329
...and they're adding more things around it...

01:02.578 --> 01:04.627
...and finance is kind of the last frontier.
