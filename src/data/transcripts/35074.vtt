It's not something the royal family like to publicize,...

00:03.249 --> 00:05.619
...but here's what we know about their main sources of income.

00:06.108 --> 00:08.390
There's something called the Duchy of Lancaster,...

00:08.839 --> 00:11.831
...almost 45,000 acres of commercial, agricultural,...

00:11.930 --> 00:13.993
...and residential properties in England and Wales...

00:14.334 --> 00:15.769
...owned on behalf of the Queen.

00:16.133 --> 00:21.141
The Duchy comprises around 710 million dollars in net assets,...

00:21.591 --> 00:22.963
...which is mostly held in trusts.

00:23.800 --> 00:27.060
The profit made by these sites, castles, historical land,...

00:27.332 --> 00:29.086
...and property at the heart of the capital...

00:29.438 --> 00:33.217
...goes directly to the Queen and no other member of the Royal Family.

00:33.764 --> 00:40.839
Last year, it netted her 20.7 million pounds or 26.7 million dollars.

00:41.418 --> 00:43.435
Next up, there's the Duchy of Cornwall.

00:44.257 --> 00:47.795
Like the Duchy of Lancaster, the Duchy of Cornwall is a private estate,...

00:48.119 --> 00:50.935
...except this one is owned on behalf of Prince Charles.

00:51.384 --> 00:55.909
In 2019, the Duchy of Cornwall paid Charles over 28 million dollars...

00:56.246 --> 00:59.689
...on almost 1.2 billion dollars of net assets.

01:00.207 --> 01:02.208
Though the profit goes directly to Charles,...

01:02.483 --> 01:06.812
...both Prince William and Prince Harry receive money from the Duchy through their father.

01:07.682 --> 01:11.398
Last year, they got around 5 million pounds in total from Prince Charles' fund.

01:12.431 --> 01:15.563
The largest source of income for the Royals is government money...

01:15.897 --> 01:17.597
...through a thing called the Sovereign Grant.

01:18.208 --> 01:21.335
In the 1700s, the monarchy handed over revenues...

01:21.570 --> 01:25.225
...from swathes of land to the government known as the Crown Estate.

01:25.373 --> 01:27.933
Each year, the government pays a percentage of the profits...

01:28.130 --> 01:30.755
...made on those assets back to the monarchy.

01:31.001 --> 01:33.757
That annual income is known as the Sovereign Grant.

01:34.044 --> 01:39.051
Last year, it amounted to almost 107 million dollars and it paid for royal duties...

01:39.188 --> 01:42.003
...and the maintenance of palaces including Buckingham Palace.
