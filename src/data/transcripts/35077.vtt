Hi, everybody.

00:01.857 --> 00:05.915
Let me start by saying the obvious: These aren't normal times.

00:06.835 --> 00:11.847
As we all manage our way through a pandemic unlike anything we've seen in a century,...

00:12.458 --> 00:15.960
...Michelle and I hope that you and your families are safe and well.

00:17.101 --> 00:21.273
If you've lost somebody to this virus or if someone in your life is sick,...

00:22.105 --> 00:25.159
...or if you're one of the millions suffering economic hardship,...

00:25.900 --> 00:27.988
...please know that you're in our prayers.

00:29.092 --> 00:33.361
Please know that you're not alone because now is the time for all of us...

00:33.480 --> 00:36.784
...to help where we can and to be there for each other...

00:37.243 --> 00:41.543
...as neighbors, as co-workers and as fellow citizens.

00:41.962 --> 00:45.900
In fact, over the past weeks, we've seen plenty of examples of the kind of courage,...

00:46.290 --> 00:48.807
...kindness and selflessness that we're going to need...

00:48.928 --> 00:51.219
...to get through one of the most difficult times in our history.

00:52.203 --> 00:56.725
Michelle and I have been amazed at the incredible bravery of our medical professionals...

00:57.048 --> 00:59.479
...who are putting their lives on the line to save others,...

01:00.037 --> 01:03.220
...the public servants and health officials battling this disease,...

01:04.121 --> 01:07.913
...the workers taking risks every day to keep our economy running,...

01:08.574 --> 01:12.425
...and everyone who's making their own sacrifice at home with their families,...

01:12.849 --> 01:14.163
...all for the greater good.

01:15.624 --> 01:19.409
But if there's one thing we've learned as a country from moments of great crisis,...

01:20.004 --> 01:22.641
...it's that the spirit of looking out for one another...

01:22.891 --> 01:29.284
...can't be restricted to our homes or our workplaces or our neighborhoods or our houses of worship.

01:30.060 --> 01:33.473
It also has to be reflected in our national government,...

01:34.284 --> 01:37.689
...the kind of leadership that's guided by knowledge and experience,...

01:38.491 --> 01:42.664
...honesty and humility, empathy and grace.

01:43.368 --> 01:47.932
That kind of leadership doesn't just belong in our state capitals and mayor's offices.

01:48.642 --> 01:49.921
It belongs in the White House,...

01:51.071 --> 01:56.112
...and that's why I'm so proud to endorse Joe Biden for president of the United States.
