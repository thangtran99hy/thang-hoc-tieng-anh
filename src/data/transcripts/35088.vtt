Hello, nice to meet you.

00:06.677 --> 00:11.923
For the past two years, Wageningen University has been working very closely with Google....

00:11.997 --> 00:16.961
...to use cutting-edge technology to look deeper into communication with plants.

00:17.140 --> 00:17.603
Hello.

00:19.108 --> 00:21.291
We collected an incredible amount of information.

00:21.509 --> 00:26.595
Using automated machine learning, we turned this information into new rudimentary language,...

00:26.851 --> 00:29.262
...which is becoming more and more sophisticated over time.

00:29.941 --> 00:35.010
The more we listen to nature, the more we discover the amazing things it has to say.

00:35.464 --> 00:35.971
What do you want?

00:37.821 --> 00:39.037
Water, please.

00:40.539 --> 00:44.365
We've applied all this research into our latest product, Google Tulip.

00:45.338 --> 00:47.682
We're rolling out the tulip language in the beginning of April,...

00:47.801 --> 00:50.194
...but we're already well underway with several updates.

00:51.079 --> 00:51.629
Hello.

00:51.880 --> 00:52.484
No.

00:53.795 --> 00:54.457
Cactus.

00:54.797 --> 00:55.871
Leave me alone.

00:55.976 --> 00:58.703
Tulip is a breakthrough in human-plant communication,...

00:58.878 --> 01:01.983
...letting users around the world communicate with any tulip.

01:03.107 --> 01:04.375
Okay, Google.

01:05.185 --> 01:06.679
Play my favorite music.
