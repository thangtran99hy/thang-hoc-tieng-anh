00:00.478 --> 00:04.552
Endlessly debating with her romantic and intellectual partner, Jean-Paul Sartre,...

00:04.947 --> 00:08.993
...de Beauvoir explored free will, desire, rights and responsibilities,...

00:09.194 --> 00:11.560
...and the value of personal experience.

00:11.985 --> 00:16.595
In the years following World War II, these ideas would converge into the school of thought...

00:16.701 --> 00:20.455
...most closely associated with their work: existentialism.

00:21.414 --> 00:25.620
Where Judeo-Christian traditions taught that humans are born with preordained purpose,...

00:25.904 --> 00:29.595
...de Beauvoir and Sartre proposed a revolutionary alternative.

00:30.011 --> 00:35.094
They argued that humans are born free and thrown into existence without a divine plan.

00:35.429 --> 00:39.509
As de Beauvoir acknowledged, this freedom is both a blessing and a burden.

00:40.118 --> 00:44.781
In the "Ethics of Ambiguity", she argued that our greatest ethical imperative...

00:44.889 --> 00:46.997
...is to create our own life's meaning,...

00:47.229 --> 00:49.919
...while protecting the freedom of others to do the same.
