00:01.158 --> 00:05.442
Well, the potential damage to the economy is not just a short-term threat.

00:05.865 --> 00:08.353
There will certainly be a longer-term impact as well.

00:08.808 --> 00:14.021
Our economics editor Faisal Islam has been looking in more detail at the latest forecasts.

00:15.722 --> 00:20.219
A month down the road and still surreal scenes of a closed country,...

00:20.618 --> 00:24.835
...the cogs of the economy paused to give space to protect public health.

00:25.385 --> 00:27.256
But it's not without its own cost.

00:27.451 --> 00:29.661
And today, the government's own internal forecaster...

00:29.842 --> 00:34.188
...set out what that could be if these scenes last for a further two months.

00:34.766 --> 00:36.249
The numbers are huge.

00:36.547 --> 00:40.665
Britain's economy could shrink by 13 percent in 2020...

00:40.963 --> 00:44.009
...in the case of a three-month coronavirus lockdown.

00:44.289 --> 00:46.124
That would be a far larger contraction...

00:46.577 --> 00:50.397
...than seen during the financial crisis over a decade ago, the World Wars,...

00:50.673 --> 00:54.246
...and the only precedent is the depression of 1920 to 21.

00:54.785 --> 00:59.100
Or if there is a bounce back; it won't be under their scenario until next year.

00:59.815 --> 01:04.725
This means permanent damage and government borrowing at 14 percent of the size of the economy,...

01:05.053 --> 01:06.688
...the highest since World War II.

01:07.134 --> 01:09.719
If you were to see the sort of decline in GDP...

01:09.815 --> 01:12.540
...that we think will be consistent with a three-month lockdown,...

01:12.619 --> 01:17.151
...then you wouldn't have seen a quarterly fall in the economy like that in living memory.

01:17.486 --> 01:20.857
The hope though, is that, that is gonna be a temporary rather than a permanent problem...

01:21.056 --> 01:25.284
...that we don't end up scarring the long-term potential of the economy.
