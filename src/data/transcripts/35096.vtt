Content creators have been the foundation of TikTok's success.

00:03.595 --> 00:07.254
These users have access to a wide range of songs, effects and filters...

00:07.588 --> 00:11.291
...to both create and share short form, entertaining videos.

00:13.286 --> 00:17.919
These self-created videos are quick, cringeworthy and often downright bizarre.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.209
A sharp contrast to most social media apps,..

00:20.347 --> 00:21.893
...which tend to focus on highlights...

00:22.061 --> 00:23.943
...or showing the best version of ourselves.

00:24.063 --> 00:28.077
TikTok uses your past likes, comments and even how long you watch videos...

00:28.238 --> 00:29.789
...or the speed at which you swipe away,...

00:29.992 --> 00:31.952
...to curate your customized timeline.

00:32.153 --> 00:35.967
And while other social media platforms use AI as a tool for recommendation,...

00:36.139 --> 00:38.077
...TikTok is fully reliant on it.

00:38.411 --> 00:40.293
It removes decision-making completely...

00:40.445 --> 00:42.812
...and serves you the videos it thinks you'll like.
