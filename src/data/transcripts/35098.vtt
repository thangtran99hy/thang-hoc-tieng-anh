00:00.051 --> 00:03.247
So, where exactly did this annoying trend begin?

00:03.775 --> 00:05.990
And more importantly, why?

00:07.525 --> 00:13.144
Believe it or not, the way we use "like" can be traced back as far as the late 19th century.

00:13.821 --> 00:18.407
Right here on the pages from the 1886 Scottish novel "Kidnapped"...

00:18.701 --> 00:20.061
...by Robert Louis Stevenson.

00:20.816 --> 00:24.081
But, it wasn't until the 1950s that a certain group...

00:24.334 --> 00:27.453
...brought the word to spotlight: The Beat Generation.

00:28.816 --> 00:30.864
The young, rebellious Beat Generation...

00:31.040 --> 00:33.807
...soon picked up the interjection as a sign of cool,...

00:34.097 --> 00:37.197
...and it was used so frequently that it turned into a trope...

00:37.401 --> 00:39.340
...for any beatnik character in pop culture.

00:39.498 --> 00:40.833
The Beats played an important role...

00:40.989 --> 00:44.077
...in introducing the new use of "like" to a larger audience,...

00:44.472 --> 00:46.258
...especially the younger generations.

00:46.831 --> 00:50.183
And 20 years later, when the word rose to prominence once again,...

00:50.529 --> 00:53.444
...it wasn't from the rebellious Beat writers in bars,...

00:53.864 --> 00:57.455
...but from the young girls in the malls of San Fernando Valley.

00:58.121 --> 00:59.737
And they had a name for themselves.

01:00.062 --> 01:02.158
They are Valley Girl!

01:02.497 --> 01:05.223
The Valley Girl was a socioeconomic stereotype...

01:05.454 --> 01:07.857
...referring to the young upper-class white girls...

01:07.961 --> 01:09.608
...living in the San Fernando Valley.

01:10.301 --> 01:12.478
These girls were known for spending days at the mall...

01:12.587 --> 01:14.039
...and dressing head to toe in pink.

01:14.665 --> 01:17.315
But, what stood out the most was the way they spoke.

01:17.780 --> 01:20.943
Barf out, I am sure!

01:21.259 --> 01:23.966
It even had its own name: Valley speak.

01:24.659 --> 01:26.751
It was what linguists call a sociolect,...

01:27.225 --> 01:31.058
...a set of dialect, slang, and words used by a specific class of people.

01:31.857 --> 01:39.297
It includes words and phrases like tubular, totally, grody, gag me with a spoon,...

01:39.863 --> 01:41.879
...some of which are still used today.

01:42.617 --> 01:44.729
And of course, the word "like."
