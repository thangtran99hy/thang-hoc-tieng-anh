When you actually reach the top, you have to remember you're only halfway there.

00:08.822 --> 00:10.491
You still need to get safely down.

00:12.939 --> 00:17.542
My name is Tapio Alhonsuo from Rovaniemi, Finland, and I'm an ice climber.

00:19.180 --> 00:25.265
When I'm climbing ice, I somehow feel like I need to be some sort of part of the iceberg.

00:25.391 --> 00:29.035
Sometimes, they are angry and they make bad sounds...

00:29.148 --> 00:30.984
...and they try to scare you away.

00:31.101 --> 00:35.509
Sometimes, they have a better mood and you feel more welcome.

00:42.142 --> 00:46.003
When you are ice climbing, you don't see the hold, you don't feel the hold...

00:46.121 --> 00:47.967
...because you have the axe in your hand.

00:48.256 --> 00:53.851
So, you have like a metal prolonging of your hand that you need to feel the ice through.

00:57.137 --> 00:59.378
When you climb a lot, you fail a lot,...

00:59.604 --> 01:04.141
...but you learn how to stand up again and you learn to see your mistakes.

01:04.257 --> 01:08.010
You correct those mistakes and you evolve and progress.
