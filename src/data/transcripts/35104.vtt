00:00.092 --> 00:02.797
Being part of this campaign is important for me...

00:03.021 --> 00:09.988
...because I feel that, it's a silly thing to say, but our kids are the future.

00:10.253 --> 00:13.082
You know, I'm very lucky to live in a city,...

00:13.175 --> 00:19.725
...in a country that the kids can have a great meal or they can drink fresh water,...

00:19.833 --> 00:23.849
...they can look after themselves and we're very fortunate that we have that.

00:24.253 --> 00:26.542
One of the things that I've always been focused on...

00:26.655 --> 00:29.435
...is making sure that other kids have that around the world.

00:29.713 --> 00:31.089
That's what's important.

00:31.313 --> 00:36.186
I want my kids to be able to understand that they are very fortunate that they have that.

00:36.384 --> 00:38.118
But, other kids around the world don't.

00:38.302 --> 00:40.037
And I will continue to fight for that...

00:40.168 --> 00:45.137
...and I'll continue to do the work that I do for the 7 Fund for UNICEF...

00:45.527 --> 00:48.697
...and for this campaign because it's important.

00:49.597 --> 00:50.437
I'm David Beckham.

00:50.661 --> 00:55.255
I'm proud to be supporting Goal 3 for good health and well-being.
