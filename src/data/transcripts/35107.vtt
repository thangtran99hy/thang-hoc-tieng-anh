00:04.516 --> 00:06.561
Atropa belladonna will kill you.

00:09.681 --> 00:12.258
Datura will put you to sleep forever.

00:13.212 --> 00:15.110
Aconitum will kill you.

00:16.272 --> 00:19.613
Laurel will produce cyanide and kill you.

00:25.282 --> 00:27.507
Every plant here in the Poison Garden is poisonous...

00:27.593 --> 00:28.791
...and has the ability to kill you.

00:32.355 --> 00:35.899
My name is Trevor Jones and I'm the head gardener of Alnwick Garden.

00:36.061 --> 00:38.005
This plant is  giant hogweed.

00:38.165 --> 00:40.371
It will get up to around about eight foot high.

00:40.678 --> 00:42.944
It's phototoxic, so it will burn your skin...

00:43.122 --> 00:45.150
...and give you blisters for up to seven years.

00:46.203 --> 00:49.139
This garden is set in the war garden of the old castle....

00:49.260 --> 00:50.664
...in Northumberland, UK.

00:51.527 --> 00:53.938
We have around about 95 plants...

00:54.439 --> 00:56.063
...and we're adding to the collection all the time.

00:56.323 --> 00:57.595
They're very, very common plants.

00:57.878 --> 01:00.515
In fact, a lot of them are what we call cottage garden plants...

01:00.857 --> 01:02.297
...and they're grown in many people's gardens,...

01:02.437 --> 01:04.483
...but people don't know how harmful they actually are.

01:06.330 --> 01:08.451
People are intrigued by poisonous plants.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.033
I'm often very worried when they come out...

01:10.123 --> 01:12.044
...because many of them will be growing these plants at home,...

01:12.628 --> 01:14.373
...and they don't realize the powerful impact...

01:14.465 --> 01:16.127
...plants can have on us humans.

01:17.263 --> 01:19.227
Is it something that you find fascinating?

01:19.313 --> 01:19.978
Definitely.

01:20.441 --> 01:20.747
Why?

01:21.853 --> 01:22.955
It's a good way to get rid of your wife.
