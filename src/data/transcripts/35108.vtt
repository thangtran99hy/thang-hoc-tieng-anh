00:00.584 --> 00:03.087
An empty plaza outside Damascus Gate...

00:03.207 --> 00:07.647
...shows just how different this Ramadan will be because of coronavirus.

00:08.029 --> 00:12.169
It's usually crowded with shoppers buying food and new clothes for the holiday.

00:12.699 --> 00:15.899
And the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site,...

00:16.220 --> 00:21.433
...which is usually filled with thousands of holiday worshipers, is also nearly deserted.

00:21.900 --> 00:26.659
Muslim clerics say people must stay home to stop the spread of the virus.

00:31.131 --> 00:33.657
With corona, the situation has changed.

00:33.870 --> 00:37.876
The Muslim religious authorities said, "Pray at home to preserve human life...

00:38.109 --> 00:40.243
...because people are more important than anything,...

00:40.547 --> 00:43.937
...more than the Kaaba in Mecca, more than the Al-Aqsa than anything.

00:44.357 --> 00:45.904
Those places will still be there,...

00:46.113 --> 00:48.571
...but if a person dies, that is permanent."

00:49.387 --> 00:52.990
He added that Islamic practices like washing before prayer...

00:53.353 --> 00:55.175
...can help protect against corona.

00:55.533 --> 00:58.951
Ramadan traditionally features large family gatherings,...

00:59.194 --> 01:02.983
...so social distancing is especially difficult during this time.

01:03.479 --> 01:06.773
But public health groups and doctors warn it's essential.

01:07.126 --> 01:11.129
The scarcity of pre-holiday shoppers in the Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem...

01:11.367 --> 01:15.187
...shows that the coronavirus is taking an economic toll.

01:19.077 --> 01:21.009
Ramadan is going to be difficult this year.

01:21.466 --> 01:23.453
We don't have work and we don't have money.

01:23.808 --> 01:25.201
I have six grandchildren.

01:25.734 --> 01:28.409
I want to buy them toys and new clothes for the holiday,...

01:28.725 --> 01:30.967
...but I haven't had any work in two months.

01:31.463 --> 01:33.215
Everyone is supposed to just stay home.

01:33.683 --> 01:34.575
It's a little sad.

01:36.621 --> 01:39.564
But religious leaders say the real meaning of Ramadan...

01:39.721 --> 01:42.476
...is saving lives and getting closer to God.
