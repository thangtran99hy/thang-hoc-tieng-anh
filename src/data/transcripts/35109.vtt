00:00.755 --> 00:01.806
Let's get this out of the way.

00:02.082 --> 00:04.148
Ancient Greece and Rome were really colorful.

00:04.650 --> 00:08.001
Their buildings were full of intricate frescoes and elaborate mosaics...

00:08.107 --> 00:10.293
...and covered with vibrantly painted statues...

00:10.535 --> 00:14.397
...of things like epic battles, glimmering gods, and pretty flowers.

00:15.072 --> 00:17.994
But today, most of us picture something more like this...

00:18.206 --> 00:20.719
...brilliant white marble as far as the eye can see.

00:21.567 --> 00:22.113
We're wrong.

00:22.371 --> 00:23.577
But, it's not our fault.

00:23.785 --> 00:24.577
It's Hollywood's fault.

00:24.875 --> 00:26.589
And our high school textbooks' fault.

00:27.093 --> 00:29.144
White marble became the norm.

00:30.149 --> 00:33.317
Along the way, art historians reinforced this bias.

00:33.742 --> 00:36.580
Namely this guy, Johann Joachim Winckelmann.

00:36.735 --> 00:38.817
He's sometimes known as the father of Art History.

00:39.268 --> 00:43.397
In the 18th century, he wrote a hugely influential book on ancient art.

00:44.205 --> 00:47.867
He went out of his way to ignore obvious evidence of colored marble,...

00:48.120 --> 00:49.601
...and there was a lot of it,...

00:49.889 --> 00:55.171
...especially after the rediscovery of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii in the 1700s.

00:55.354 --> 00:59.200
And one particular mural of an artist in the act of painting a sculpture.

01:00.303 --> 01:02.568
This colorful sculpture was also found in Pompeii.

01:02.979 --> 01:05.961
Winckelmann claimed it was too primitive to have been made by them.

01:07.900 --> 01:09.747
But, evidence wasn't just ignored.

01:09.958 --> 01:11.497
Some of it might have been destroyed.

01:12.032 --> 01:14.677
Luckily, art historians have since shifted to believe...

01:14.758 --> 01:16.851
...it's not about what people think looks better.

01:17.079 --> 01:17.923
It's about what's accurate.

01:18.582 --> 01:21.565
But, how did they get from this to this?

01:24.178 --> 01:27.735
Today, scientists can extract and test those tiny samples...

01:27.940 --> 01:29.800
...to determine the original pigments used.

01:30.492 --> 01:33.769
To the Greeks and the Romans, painting a sculpture made it complete.

01:34.422 --> 01:37.929
Color can make marble seem human or godlike.

01:38.637 --> 01:40.739
It infused them with drama and emotion.

01:41.289 --> 01:43.737
It brought history and mythology to life.

01:44.127 --> 01:46.951
And even though these reconstructions aren't perfect,...

01:47.081 --> 01:48.677
...seeing these statues in color...

01:48.790 --> 01:50.302
...can bring us a little closer...

01:50.433 --> 01:53.209
...to understanding what the ancient world might have looked like.
