00:00.530 --> 00:04.103
If you dream of standing ovations, gold medals...

00:04.685 --> 00:06.581
...and record-breaking times,...

00:08.005 --> 00:08.975
...know one thing.

00:10.052 --> 00:12.656
The track to glory won't always be clear.

00:13.496 --> 00:15.536
There will be bumps along the way.

00:18.872 --> 00:20.307
Tears will be shed,...

00:21.888 --> 00:23.505
...limbs will be bruised...

00:25.772 --> 00:27.383
...and so will egos.

00:30.511 --> 00:32.389
But however hard you fall,...

00:32.988 --> 00:34.519
...however bad you fail,...

00:35.229 --> 00:38.135
...you must always get up again.

00:39.240 --> 00:39.737
Up again.

00:40.922 --> 00:41.925
Up again.

00:43.529 --> 00:46.923
To rule the ice, you need to silence the critics,...

00:47.813 --> 00:50.363
...including the ones in your own head.

00:52.050 --> 00:53.901
Be proud of who you are.

00:55.329 --> 00:57.077
When others want you to hide,...

00:57.961 --> 01:00.474
...don't be afraid of what might happen.

01:01.219 --> 01:03.168
Embrace the future instead.

01:04.285 --> 01:06.189
Because to be a champion like me,...

01:06.394 --> 01:09.721
"From Spain, Javier Fernandez"

01:09.893 --> 01:14.381
...to reach a higher level, you have to take risks...

01:15.397 --> 01:17.400
...and learn from your mistakes.

01:18.378 --> 01:22.154
Only then will you get up again.

01:23.543 --> 01:24.109
Up again.
