00:01.177 --> 00:03.615
Stunting is the result of chronic malnutrition.

00:05.526 --> 00:06.745
So a child might be eating,...

00:07.152 --> 00:09.547
...but not necessarily getting the complexity of nutrients...

00:09.627 --> 00:10.785
...that you need to grow well.

00:12.521 --> 00:16.095
One in four children under five in South Africa are stunted.

00:18.129 --> 00:22.009
Stunting undermines the physical and the cognitive development of a child,...

00:22.225 --> 00:23.827
....and it's almost completely preventable.

00:24.732 --> 00:27.775
The brain is developing in the first trimester...

00:28.085 --> 00:29.865
...and your baby is starting to move.

00:32.099 --> 00:33.246
Grow Great was created...

00:33.337 --> 00:37.101
...in response to the high levels of stunting in South Africa.

00:37.757 --> 00:39.902
So the critical time is pregnancy.

00:40.141 --> 00:41.667
Flourish is a mum and baby groups...

00:41.747 --> 00:45.649
...that seeks to support, celebrate and empower new and pregnant moms...

00:45.720 --> 00:47.519
...through the critical first thousand days,...

00:47.967 --> 00:50.366
...and Champions for Children are community health care workers...

00:50.511 --> 00:52.786
...providing households with intervention...

00:52.993 --> 00:55.130
...that support maternal and child health nutrition.

00:56.079 --> 01:00.046
We are denying ourselves the promise of this precious human capital...

01:00.206 --> 01:02.145
...by not preventing stunting.
