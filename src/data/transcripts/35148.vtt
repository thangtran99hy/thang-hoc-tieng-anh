The Conservation Fund is a national non-profit organization...

00:05.978 --> 00:07.976
...operating across all 50 states.

00:09.213 --> 00:12.931
We are chartered for both conservation and economic development.

00:13.300 --> 00:18.373
We are able to increase the economic opportunities for rural communities,...

00:18.465 --> 00:21.691
...their timber harvesting while also protecting the forest...

00:21.815 --> 00:23.099
...and all of nature's benefits.

00:23.583 --> 00:26.189
As we watched more than a million acres of forest land...

00:26.283 --> 00:27.423
...come on the market each year,...

00:27.501 --> 00:29.406
...we realized we needed a new approach.

00:30.077 --> 00:33.669
The collaboration between Goldman Sachs and the Conservation Fund...

00:33.760 --> 00:35.487
...is a great example of progress.

00:36.060 --> 00:37.127
The Conservation Fund...

00:37.225 --> 00:41.685
...issued the nation's first green bond for conservation with Goldman Sachs...

00:41.799 --> 00:44.666
...and together, we helped invent a new way...

00:44.807 --> 00:47.727
...of going to scale protecting these magnificent lands.
