Hi, I'm Anna Miller,...

00:02.790 --> 00:03.788
...and I'm Skye Flanigan.

00:04.051 --> 00:05.126
And we're from Harvard C-CHANGE.

00:05.284 --> 00:08.144
And here are three reasons to be optimistic about climate change:

00:08.483 --> 00:12.155
Number one: We're seeing huge innovations in climate solutions.

00:12.459 --> 00:14.840
Our dependency on fossil fuel is going down rapidly.

00:14.959 --> 00:17.910
Last year alone, we've cut our consumption by 13 percent...

00:18.037 --> 00:19.493
...and we're on track to do the same this year.

00:20.109 --> 00:24.453
And renewable energy like wind and solar is becoming cheaper than coal...

00:24.575 --> 00:25.834
...in a lot of places in the U.S.

00:26.259 --> 00:29.809
Number two: We're seeing a drastic shift in public opinion.

00:30.103 --> 00:34.204
From 2014 to 2019, the number of Americans who felt alarmed tripled.

00:34.516 --> 00:35.985
So, that's actually really good news...

00:36.132 --> 00:38.497
...because it means people are learning more about this issue.

00:38.729 --> 00:39.748
They really care about it...

00:40.106 --> 00:42.561
...and they're starting to understand how it affects them personally.

00:42.905 --> 00:45.611
Number three: Local governments are taking action.

00:45.952 --> 00:49.683
Just recently, Virginia and Oregon both committed to 100 percent clean energy.

00:49.875 --> 00:53.013
Over 445 mayors across the United States...

00:53.329 --> 00:55.697
...have committed to staying in the Paris Climate Accord.

00:56.249 --> 00:58.642
Climate change has been portrayed with a lot of doom and gloom...

00:58.813 --> 01:01.135
...but it's also the greatest opportunity we have...

01:01.248 --> 01:04.162
...to reach a healthier and more sustainable future for everybody.
