I speak to you today at the same hour as my father did exactly 75 years ago.

00:08.289 --> 00:12.537
His message then was a salute to the men and women at home and abroad...

00:13.079 --> 00:19.203
...who had sacrificed so much in pursuit of what he rightly called a "great deliverance."

00:20.865 --> 00:28.228
The war had been a total war. It had affected everyone, and no one was immune from its impact.

00:29.439 --> 00:35.589
Whether it be the men and women called up to serve; families separated from each other;...

00:36.134 --> 00:41.078
...or people asked to take up new roles and skills to support the war effort,...

00:41.737 --> 00:43.422
...all had a part to play.

00:45.406 --> 00:52.997
At the start, the outlook seemed bleak, the end distant, the outcome uncertain.

00:54.076 --> 00:56.739
But we kept faith that the cause was right...

00:57.840 --> 01:02.896
...and this belief, as my father noted in his broadcast, carried us through.

01:03.789 --> 01:08.681
Never give up, never despair. That was the message of VE Day.

01:09.979 --> 01:15.879
Today, it may seem hard that we cannot mark this special anniversary as we would wish.

01:16.751 --> 01:20.336
Instead, we remember from our homes and our doorsteps.

01:21.345 --> 01:27.310
But our streets are not empty; they are filled with the love and the care that we have for each other.

01:28.460 --> 01:30.922
And when I look at our country today,...

01:31.189 --> 01:35.701
...and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another,...

01:36.398 --> 01:37.911
I say with pride...

01:38.494 --> 01:46.019
...that we are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognize and admire.

01:47.364 --> 01:50.132
I send my warmest good wishes to you all.
