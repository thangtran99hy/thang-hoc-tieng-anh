00:01.241 --> 00:03.420
The Asahi had many great players,...

00:03.872 --> 00:08.342
...but one of the greatest and most popular was Roy Yamamura.

00:10.063 --> 00:13.729
Roy joined the Asahi as a shortstop when he was just 15.

00:15.332 --> 00:20.111
Small in stature but quick and agile, Roy was a typical Asahi.

00:21.121 --> 00:24.414
To take on the bigger, stronger Caucasian teams,...

00:24.838 --> 00:27.451
...the Asahi had developed their own style of play;

00:28.187 --> 00:31.047
one that relied on defense and speed.

00:32.441 --> 00:36.230
Roy's ability to steal bases, as many as 50 a season,...

00:36.765 --> 00:41.979
...combined with the team's precision bunting and fielding made Asahi unstoppable.

00:43.611 --> 00:49.545
Beginning in 1937, the Asahi won a string of championships; five years in a row.

00:50.777 --> 00:54.257
But in 1941, the winning streak came to an end.

00:55.906 --> 00:57.837
When Canada declared war on Japan,...

00:58.423 --> 01:03.636
...the federal government interned all people of Japanese descent including the Asahi.

01:05.398 --> 01:08.629
After 18 years as a player and three as a manager,...

01:09.177 --> 01:11.975
...Roy and his fellow teammates had to disband.

01:13.089 --> 01:15.578
They never again played together as a team.
