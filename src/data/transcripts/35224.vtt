Euglena is a genus of single cell flagellate eukaryotics.

00:04.839 --> 00:09.269
It is the best known and most widely studied member of the class Euglenoidea,...

00:09.428 --> 00:14.344
...a diverse group containing some 54 genera and at least 800 species.

00:15.150 --> 00:18.777
Species of Euglena are found in freshwater and salt water.

00:19.197 --> 00:21.845
They are often abundant in quiet inland waters...

00:22.010 --> 00:23.360
...where they may bloom in numbers...

00:23.457 --> 00:27.202
...sufficient to color the surface of ponds and ditches green or red.

00:27.351 --> 00:33.083
The species Euglena gracilis has been used extensively in the laboratory as a model organism.

00:33.230 --> 00:38.536
Most species of Euglena have photosynthesizing chloroplasts within the body of the cell,...

00:38.703 --> 00:41.693
...which enable them to feed by autotrophy, like plants.

00:42.543 --> 00:46.561
However, they can also take nourishment heterotrophically, like animals.

00:46.931 --> 00:50.149
Since Euglena have features of both animals and plants,...

00:50.317 --> 00:54.127
...early taxonomists, working within the Linnaean three-kingdom system...

00:54.205 --> 00:56.186
...of biological classification,...

00:56.373 --> 00:58.084
...found them difficult to classify.

00:58.871 --> 01:02.679
It was the question of where to put such "unclassifiable" creatures...

01:02.813 --> 01:06.585
...that prompted Ernst Haeckel to add a third living kingdom to the Animale,...

01:06.735 --> 01:09.551
Vegetabile of Linnaeus: the Kingdom Protista.
