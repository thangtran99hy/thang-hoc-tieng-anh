The most characteristic feature of Euglena is its single long flagellum...

00:05.677 --> 00:07.423
...which is used for locomotion.

00:08.352 --> 00:13.772
it also has an organ for sensing light called the stigma or eye spot.

00:14.611 --> 00:17.533
This enables the organism to orientate itself...

00:17.704 --> 00:22.545
...so that it can obtain the optimum amount of light which it needs for photosynthesis.

00:23.339 --> 00:27.469
This process is called positive phototaxis.

00:28.655 --> 00:32.682
The chloroplasts and chlorophyll A and chlorophyll B in Euglena...

00:32.991 --> 00:35.208
...are similar to those in plants.

00:35.789 --> 00:42.488
However Euglena differs from plants in being motile and lacking a cellulose cell wall.

00:43.347 --> 00:49.242
Instead, the shape of the cell is maintained to some extent by the pellicle.

00:49.610 --> 00:52.470
A layer just outside the cell surface membrane.

00:55.365 --> 01:00.454
Glucose is stored in the form of paramylon which is produced by the pyrenoid.

01:01.349 --> 01:02.926
As in other protozoans,...

01:03.137 --> 01:09.031
...the exchange of gases and the excretion of waste takes place via the plasma membrane...

01:09.199 --> 01:15.032
...and osmoregulation is carried out by the contractile vacuoles.
