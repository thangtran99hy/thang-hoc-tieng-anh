Maggie counts with this foot.

00:03.381 --> 00:07.697
Basically, the first time I said, "Maggie, how many is this honey?"

00:09.525 --> 00:11.135
And that's it! Good!

00:11.701 --> 00:12.684
Sit down, good!

00:13.985 --> 00:16.581
And then, I realized I didn't even have to use fingers.

00:16.665 --> 00:17.633
I could just ask her.

00:18.204 --> 00:20.831
So I said like, "Maggie what's two times three?"

00:24.099 --> 00:24.686
Perfect!

00:25.851 --> 00:26.905
It's perfect!

00:30.141 --> 00:31.782
She gets a little treat for that. Good.

00:32.276 --> 00:35.401
And then, maybe one of you would?

00:36.160 --> 00:37.331
I would love to.

00:37.591 --> 00:38.873
Maggie, no, Maggie?

00:39.134 --> 00:43.121
Magpie, what's eight minus two?

00:43.899 --> 00:45.621
Eight minus two?

00:48.858 --> 00:49.319
Yes.

00:49.409 --> 00:49.905
Wow!

00:51.327 --> 00:52.181
Good girl. Sit down. Good.

00:54.655 --> 00:55.869
Would you like to ask her one as well?

00:55.981 --> 00:56.295
Sure.

00:56.501 --> 00:57.185
Maggie, listen up.

00:57.957 --> 01:00.113
What is the capital of Alabama?

01:03.335 --> 01:04.437
How about an addition question?

01:04.577 --> 01:04.862
Okay.

01:04.980 --> 01:05.307
Alright.

01:06.721 --> 01:08.197
Maggie, three plus three?

01:09.044 --> 01:11.986
Everybody says the answer is six, do you think this is a trick?

01:14.639 --> 01:15.225
That's good.

01:18.283 --> 01:20.347
Something other than six isn't an answer so...

01:22.489 --> 01:24.668
Maggie, two times four?

01:25.321 --> 01:25.973
That's a tough one.
