Honeybees learn math.

00:02.766 --> 00:04.433
How smart can honeybees be?

00:05.037 --> 00:07.826
Honeybees have proven to be surprisingly intelligent...

00:07.927 --> 00:10.292
...compared to other critters in the insect kingdom.

00:10.854 --> 00:15.125
They have their own dance communication system and can understand the concept of zero.

00:15.615 --> 00:18.225
And the recent study shows that that's not all they can do.

00:18.664 --> 00:21.274
New research published in the journal Science Advances...

00:21.355 --> 00:24.997
...reveals that honeybees are capable of understanding simple math problems.

00:26.079 --> 00:29.197
The Australian research team began by teaching 14 honeybees...

00:29.301 --> 00:30.739
...the basic rules of arithmetic.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.203
They trained them to enter a y-shaped maze...

00:33.277 --> 00:36.044
...where they first faced a series of color geometric shapes.

00:36.652 --> 00:38.752
The number and the color of the shapes would vary.

00:39.088 --> 00:39.997
If the shapes were blue,...

00:40.074 --> 00:43.071
...the bee had to add one unit to the image presented at the entrance.

00:43.430 --> 00:46.206
If the shapes were yellow, it had to subtract one unit.

00:46.804 --> 00:49.843
If they chose the correct answer they would be rewarded with sugar water.

00:50.005 --> 00:53.489
If the answer was incorrect, they would get a bitter solution called quinine.

00:53.981 --> 00:56.561
After 100 trials that took four to seven hours,...

00:56.651 --> 00:59.937
...the bees had learned a basic concept of addition and subtraction.

01:00.444 --> 01:04.983
The bees were able to choose the correct answer between 63 and 72 percent of the time.

01:05.285 --> 01:07.763
Not too bad for a sesame-sized brain.

01:08.324 --> 01:10.388
Of course, this is extremely simple stuff...

01:10.517 --> 01:14.471
...but it is quite impressive that an insect with a brain that measures a cubic millimeter...

01:14.583 --> 01:17.338
...can figure out basic math in 100 tries.
