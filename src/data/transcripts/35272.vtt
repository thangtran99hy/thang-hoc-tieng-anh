During the shutdown, I had extra time to read.

00:05.241 --> 00:07.473
Here are five books that I highly recommend.

00:08.386 --> 00:10.575
The Choice by Dr. Edith Eger.

00:10.891 --> 00:12.814
It's a hell of a story.

00:13.058 --> 00:16.774
The woman was a 16-year-old girl in Auschwitz.

00:16.951 --> 00:19.022
She eventually does survive,...

00:19.353 --> 00:21.301
...gets out and moves to Texas,...

00:21.450 --> 00:23.721
...and becomes this inspirational therapist,...

00:23.819 --> 00:24.967
...and half of the book is her story.

00:25.047 --> 00:27.047
Half of it is how she helps other people.

00:27.859 --> 00:29.920
Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell.

00:30.321 --> 00:33.078
It such an unusual book and it's clever.

00:33.393 --> 00:35.938
You go through six different epics in history...

00:36.312 --> 00:38.546
...where you have people making moral choices,...

00:38.643 --> 00:42.813
...where you see how self-centered and bad people can be,...

00:42.962 --> 00:45.601
...and how supportive and good people can be.

00:45.848 --> 00:49.099
You really do feel he captures these different worlds.

00:49.594 --> 00:52.156
The Ride of a Lifetime by Bob Iger.

00:53.021 --> 00:57.087
It's hard to overstate how demoralized and messed up Disney was.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.907
Things weren't in great shape when they got rid of Eisner.

01:00.041 --> 01:02.706
And I do consider it brilliant of Iger...

01:03.165 --> 01:05.700
...that in an age where networks are not important,...

01:06.035 --> 01:07.908
...and you're going to have to go direct to consumer,...

01:08.007 --> 01:11.931
...that you've got to have a critical mass of the greatest content.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.891
The Great Influenza by John Barry.

01:15.258 --> 01:20.329
He explains how infections work and how the immune system works.

01:20.493 --> 01:24.379
The 1918 Spanish Flu is the first world epidemic...

01:24.515 --> 01:27.669
...where it basically hits the entire world at the same time.

01:28.197 --> 01:33.759
Good Economics for Hard Times by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo.

01:34.498 --> 01:37.005
This is the most important book of the group...

01:37.185 --> 01:41.838
...because it really is about what do we know in the field of economics...

01:42.126 --> 01:45.954
...that can take the current divisions and try and do better.

01:46.655 --> 01:48.622
I found all these books really interesting,...

01:48.978 --> 01:50.390
...and I hope you do also.
