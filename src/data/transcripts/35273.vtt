I think, for me, the definition of success...

00:05.218 --> 00:09.098
...is closing the distance between dream to reality.

00:10.811 --> 00:13.292
Since I started using machine intelligence in my work,...

00:14.209 --> 00:15.897
...I can truly feel that...

00:16.527 --> 00:19.785
...when I say I would like to take my brush...

00:20.609 --> 00:22.431
...and dip it into the machine's mind...

00:22.996 --> 00:26.621
...and paint with machine consciousness that act itself...

00:27.657 --> 00:33.556
...has a deep emotional connection with an entity, with a system.

00:35.478 --> 00:36.654
Hello, I'm Refik Anadol.

00:36.827 --> 00:38.650
I'm a media artist and director.

00:39.007 --> 00:41.687
My work is completely human-centric.

00:42.041 --> 00:44.239
My work is all about human emotions...

00:44.744 --> 00:49.146
...and feeling connected with the environment that we inhabit.

00:50.087 --> 00:54.887
And I do hope that every single mind and soul can feel it,...

00:55.732 --> 01:01.356
...can play with it and enjoy being human in the 21st century.
