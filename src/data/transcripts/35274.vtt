A two-year-old pet Samoyed living in Jiangsu province...

00:03.543 --> 00:05.970
...has shown a remarkable talent for math.

00:06.548 --> 00:11.158
Tudou, or Potato, can add, subtract, multiply, and divide with ease.

00:11.531 --> 00:14.927
This is how Lu Zesheng tests Tudou on his math skills.

00:16.432 --> 00:18.735
How many digits does ten million have?

00:22.279 --> 00:25.329
How many zeros after one in ten million?

00:28.183 --> 00:29.676
Oh, seven zeros.

00:29.989 --> 00:35.388
How much is 3.44 plus 3.56?

00:36.386 --> 00:39.220
Even the written word poses no problems for Potato,...

00:39.616 --> 00:41.976
...who recognized the figures with ease.

00:43.407 --> 00:45.329
When told the cameraman's cell phone number,...

00:45.635 --> 00:47.143
...Potato apparently memorized it...

00:47.235 --> 00:50.364
...and was able to recall a specific digit when asked to by Lu.

00:51.989 --> 00:55.994
What's the third digit of the cameraman's mobile phone number?

00:58.381 --> 01:00.073
So, what's next for Potato?

01:00.857 --> 01:04.245
Well maybe university if they start accepting dogs.
