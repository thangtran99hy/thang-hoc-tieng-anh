00:00.783 --> 00:04.758
Before you call the cops, I just want you to know,...

00:06.323 --> 00:11.815
...the first thing that I did when I woke up this morning was yell at my alarm clock.

00:12.866 --> 00:16.005
My parents were raised in the South.

00:16.919 --> 00:19.686
They raised me in Las Vegas.

00:21.213 --> 00:22.875
That city still has my heart.

00:24.319 --> 00:26.641
I hate spiders.

00:27.499 --> 00:28.811
I'm a vegetarian.

00:29.876 --> 00:31.296
I'm not proud about it.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.865
I've done goat yoga.

00:35.117 --> 00:37.605
I'm really not proud about that.

00:38.721 --> 00:44.027
I can tell you every single word off the NWA "Straight Outta Compton" album.

00:45.029 --> 00:49.811
I can also sing you every single word from 'Oklahoma.'

00:50.585 --> 00:53.383
Bananas are disgusting.

00:54.295 --> 00:55.484
I am a Christian.

00:57.075 --> 01:02.164
I spend almost every Sunday morning teaching kids in Sunday school.

01:03.251 --> 01:05.744
I am often asked if I am Muslim.

01:07.597 --> 01:08.765
I'm ok with that.

01:09.609 --> 01:15.627
I'm pretty much convinced if you met my mother, you'd automatically become a better person.

01:17.007 --> 01:19.125
My father is a veteran.

01:20.440 --> 01:26.025
He taught me how to say "Yes, sir" and "Yes, ma'am" to everyone that I meet.

01:26.745 --> 01:29.295
I don't hate our president.

01:31.094 --> 01:32.173
I pray for him.

01:33.311 --> 01:38.989
I love basketball and also hockey.

01:40.757 --> 01:43.463
This is my brother, James.

01:44.751 --> 01:46.993
This is my brother, Mike.

01:48.986 --> 01:51.389
This is my brother, John,...

01:51.976 --> 01:54.200
...and this is my brother, Rob.

01:54.645 --> 01:56.175
I've never been to jail.

01:57.959 --> 01:59.729
I've never owned a gun.

02:01.405 --> 02:07.473
I hate that anyone at all might possibly be afraid of me.

02:08.579 --> 02:16.330
I'd go around the world and back again if I knew that single act might make your day better.

02:17.092 --> 02:18.435
I'm a proud man.

02:21.161 --> 02:23.401
I'm a proud black man.

02:24.533 --> 02:26.341
Does any of this really matter?

02:27.977 --> 02:28.436
No.

02:30.950 --> 02:37.247
I just wanted you to get to know me better before you call the cops.
