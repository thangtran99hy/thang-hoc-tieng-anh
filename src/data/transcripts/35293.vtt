Hello friends.

00:07.327 --> 00:09.877
Today, we will learn about light pollution.

00:14.287 --> 00:18.386
Most of us are familiar with air, water, sound and land pollution...

00:18.935 --> 00:21.779
...but did you know that light can also be a pollutant?

00:22.768 --> 00:29.627
Light pollution is defined as any bad effect as a result of man-made or artificial lights.

00:29.751 --> 00:33.433
In simple words, this means too much light.

00:33.701 --> 00:39.705
Several species, including plants, animals and humans are badly affected by light pollution.

00:39.959 --> 00:43.565
Um... now let's see the components of light pollution.

00:43.971 --> 00:45.051
Sky glow.

00:45.289 --> 00:49.055
This is when too many artificial lights cause the night sky to glow.

00:49.311 --> 00:52.605
You can easily notice this when looking down at a well-lit city.

00:52.826 --> 00:57.977
The sky above the city is too brightened and is harmful for all the species.

00:58.366 --> 01:02.031
Light pollution dramatically reduces the visibility of stars.

01:02.307 --> 01:06.664
In pristine areas, clouds appear black and blot out the stars.

01:07.243 --> 01:10.877
In urban areas, cloud strongly enhanced sky glow.

01:11.170 --> 01:11.825
Glare.

01:12.079 --> 01:14.423
This is when a light that is very very bright...

01:14.511 --> 01:18.961
...and often causes glare or visual discomfort when looking towards the light.

01:19.352 --> 01:20.559
Oh no!
