00:00.050 --> 00:00.713
Clutter.

00:01.007 --> 00:03.713
This is when you have too many lights bunched up together...

00:03.938 --> 00:06.767
...or when the lights are grouped in very confusing ways.

00:07.379 --> 00:09.945
It can make you confused or dizzy looking at them.

00:10.149 --> 00:11.479
Light trespass.

00:12.062 --> 00:15.536
It is the light falling where it is not intended or needed.

00:15.820 --> 00:19.703
How bad you feel when your neighbor's security lights shining through your bedroom windows...

00:19.785 --> 00:21.389
...and lighting up your room all night?

00:21.646 --> 00:26.073
Sources of light pollution include building exterior and interior lighting,...

00:26.464 --> 00:30.233
...advertising, commercial properties, factories, offices,...

00:30.479 --> 00:33.487
...street lights and illuminated sporting venues.

00:33.851 --> 00:35.135
We need light at night,...

00:35.377 --> 00:38.865
...but the fact is that too much outdoor lighting used at night...

00:38.999 --> 00:41.467
...is inefficient and completely unnecessary.

00:41.686 --> 00:47.673
This light and the electricity used to create it is being wasted by spilling it into the sky...

00:48.080 --> 00:53.015
...rather than focusing it onto the actual objects in areas that people want illuminated.

00:53.229 --> 00:58.133
This kind of LED droplight could reduce unnecessary light pollution in building interiors.

00:58.301 --> 01:01.842
We should ensure that light is only directed below the horizontal.

01:02.173 --> 01:06.272
Which means less light is wasted through directing it outwards and upwards.

01:06.577 --> 01:10.614
Light pollution affects every citizen, increasing energy consumption,...

01:10.891 --> 01:13.383
...disrupting the ecosystem and wildlife,...

01:13.745 --> 01:17.632
...harming human health and also affecting crime and safety.

01:17.812 --> 01:20.363
So we should try to reduce this.

01:20.667 --> 01:21.917
Bye-bye!
