00:00.226 --> 00:01.146
Well, thank you very much.

00:01.234 --> 00:04.275
I just want to say this is a very exciting day for our country.

00:04.959 --> 00:08.686
We have been at this long and hard for three and a half years.

00:09.701 --> 00:13.283
I want to thank Elon who's has been a friend of mine for a long time,...

00:13.419 --> 00:14.814
...somebody I have great respect for.

00:15.003 --> 00:16.003
This has been your baby.

00:16.212 --> 00:17.489
This is the top focus by far.

00:17.567 --> 00:18.590
This is the toughest one.

00:18.693 --> 00:21.631
In fact, that I told my team it's not simply the top priority,...

00:21.731 --> 00:22.663
...it is the only priority.

00:22.958 --> 00:23.526
That's great.

00:23.699 --> 00:24.213
That's great.

00:24.365 --> 00:25.313
Well, it looks beautiful.

00:25.423 --> 00:27.793
We won't say congratulations because we have a long way to go,...

00:27.881 --> 00:30.121
...but it looks magnificent,...

00:30.239 --> 00:31.797
...and I just want to thank everybody in the room.

00:31.910 --> 00:34.753
Jim, you took it over from its infancy,...

00:35.585 --> 00:40.864
...and I was saying before, they had grass growing in the runways between the cracks...

00:40.975 --> 00:43.511
...and now, we have the best, the best of the best.

00:44.122 --> 00:46.781
And I want to thank again Vice President Mike Pence.

00:46.877 --> 00:48.323
He's worked so hard.

00:48.824 --> 00:49.969
It's been a labor of love,...

00:50.073 --> 00:53.019
...and great job, really, great job.

00:53.384 --> 00:54.907
I want to thank everybody down here,...

00:55.006 --> 00:59.536
...and this is something the First Lady and I look very much forward to seeing.

01:00.241 --> 01:02.672
And in a short while, that's going to be a lift off.

01:02.764 --> 01:05.054
It looks like we're probably going to make it weather wise.

01:05.145 --> 01:05.889
Jim, is that right?

01:07.031 --> 01:08.497
We are a go for launch right now.

01:09.019 --> 01:10.198
That sounds very exciting,...

01:10.298 --> 01:12.161
...so I hope you all enjoy it.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.047
Thank you very much.

01:13.111 --> 01:13.995
Thank you for being here.
