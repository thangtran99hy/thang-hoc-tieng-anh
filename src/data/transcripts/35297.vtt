00:00.349 --> 00:02.068
No one has ever come back from 3 - 1.

00:02.825 --> 00:04.019
Agonizing defeat.

00:04.359 --> 00:05.453
Down 5 - 1.

00:06.689 --> 00:08.803
We've all been underestimated and counted out.

00:11.065 --> 00:13.451
In those moments, we felt like it was over.

00:16.339 --> 00:17.884
But it's when we were given no chance,...

00:20.205 --> 00:23.915
...that we somehow found that last bit of strength to keep fighting.

00:25.750 --> 00:27.754
And then we did what no one thought we could,...

00:29.029 --> 00:30.095
...not even ourselves.

00:35.195 --> 00:36.864
We came back from the impossible,...

00:41.494 --> 00:42.330
...from being broken.

00:47.553 --> 00:49.417
We found a way when it seemed hopeless.

00:53.561 --> 00:56.037
We came back when we should have been long forgotten,...

00:58.937 --> 01:01.231
...but we did it time and time again.

01:05.423 --> 01:07.647
Right now, we're fighting for something...

01:07.752 --> 01:10.096
...much bigger than a win or championship,...

01:11.825 --> 01:13.639
...but if we learned anything from sports,...

01:17.089 --> 01:19.612
...is that no matter how far down we may be,...

01:22.629 --> 01:24.029
...we are never far too down to come back.
