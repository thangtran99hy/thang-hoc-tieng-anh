Hey, dad.

00:07.223 --> 00:09.691
Why do you spend so much time with them...

00:11.108 --> 00:12.580
...and so little with me?

00:15.191 --> 00:18.208
When are we gonna build that treehouse you were talking about...

00:21.038 --> 00:23.387
...or take that trip to the sea?

00:28.324 --> 00:31.213
You're never there when something great happens.

00:37.544 --> 00:40.336
One time, you even forgot my birthday,...

00:42.412 --> 00:45.297
...and I had to teach myself how to ride a bike.

00:50.299 --> 00:52.745
If you could only know how much I miss you.

00:59.001 --> 01:06.185
I promise myself when I'm a dad, I'm gonna do things differently.
