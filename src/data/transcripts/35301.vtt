Tell me if you can relate to this.

00:02.219 --> 00:04.809
You were an avid reader of fiction as a kid.

00:05.062 --> 00:09.511
The Harry Potter series, The Hunger Games, Bobby Pendragon, Percy Jackson.

00:09.716 --> 00:13.347
You ate them like ice cream; you drank them like water in summertime...

00:13.432 --> 00:14.865
...after running around at the park.

00:15.082 --> 00:18.981
You would spend hours in your bedroom, in another world, in another universe.

00:19.317 --> 00:20.533
I was one of those kids.

00:20.826 --> 00:22.202
That was my experience growing up.

00:22.406 --> 00:26.397
But somewhere along the line, like early teenage years, that all ended.

00:26.545 --> 00:27.993
I'm not sure it's a coincidence...

00:28.071 --> 00:30.667
...that I got my first smartphone when I was 14 years old.

00:30.947 --> 00:33.546
Suddenly, there were a lot of other things capturing my attention,...

00:33.694 --> 00:35.074
...you know, better things to do.

00:35.385 --> 00:38.678
I feel like many of us who are now in our 20s and 30s went through this.

00:38.824 --> 00:41.027
I mean, I went years without reading anything...

00:41.102 --> 00:43.302
...outside of what I was required to read at school.

00:43.620 --> 00:45.891
Last year, though, I rediscovered books,...

00:46.018 --> 00:49.709
...and now they are my very favorite way to absorb new information.

00:50.060 --> 00:53.251
I honestly think that every single book I have ever read...

00:53.592 --> 00:56.938
...has changed me and my perspective of the world in some way.
