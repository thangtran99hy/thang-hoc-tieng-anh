Books are incredible...

00:01.465 --> 00:03.925
...in the sense that they are usually thousands...

00:03.995 --> 00:08.497
...or many thousands of hours of work, and energy, and knowledge,...

00:08.611 --> 00:10.431
...condensed into a few hundred pages.

00:11.373 --> 00:15.381
The author is imparting in you a piece of their lives,...

00:15.453 --> 00:17.793
...of what they know, or their imagination.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.327
A part of them, basically.

00:19.501 --> 00:21.337
It's actually a beautiful concept if you think about it.

00:21.711 --> 00:23.143
I have a few book recommendations,...

00:23.242 --> 00:25.686
...but I'm gonna save that for the second half of this video.

00:26.233 --> 00:29.623
And, like I said before, reading transports you to another place.

00:29.715 --> 00:32.019
And I used to think that was exclusive to fiction,...

00:32.089 --> 00:32.829
...but that's not true at all.

00:33.178 --> 00:35.624
Like I said, it was only recently, last summer actually,...

00:35.725 --> 00:38.053
...that I rediscovered books through my smartphone, actually.

00:38.197 --> 00:38.725
Believe it or not.

00:39.068 --> 00:40.441
Things always go full circle.

00:40.723 --> 00:41.228
It's amazing.

00:41.549 --> 00:44.711
I mainly listen to them in the morning when I go running, when I'm cooking,...

00:44.881 --> 00:45.989
...or before I go to bed.

00:46.314 --> 00:49.077
But they're also wonderful to listen to when you're exploring the city,...

00:49.161 --> 00:51.167
...or you know, when I'm coloring footage.

00:51.861 --> 00:56.117
I think I was really hungry for new perspectives and insights on life.

00:56.243 --> 00:57.834
And now I'm just trying to make up for lost time...

00:57.917 --> 01:00.375
...because there's just something amazing about books,..

01:00.456 --> 01:03.724
...and how they're able to expand your mind and perspective.

01:03.901 --> 01:07.690
I think it's fair to say there isn't another medium that can go deeper on a topic.
