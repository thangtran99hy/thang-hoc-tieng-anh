Today, I want to talk about some of the things that I did...

00:02.263 --> 00:04.453
...to improve my experience on social media.

00:05.163 --> 00:07.485
And I did that by both reducing my time on there,...

00:07.586 --> 00:10.701
...and also making a few changes to make it more positive,...

00:10.975 --> 00:13.485
...so that I don't get that sinking feeling of failure.

00:14.111 --> 00:20.079
Social media completely altered the way pretty much all of us interact and see the world.

00:20.347 --> 00:22.285
I've struggled with social media in the past.

00:22.436 --> 00:28.058
At times it has messed with my self-esteem, and distorted my perception of reality,...

00:28.187 --> 00:29.316
...and the lives that people lead.

00:29.705 --> 00:32.495
It can be addicting, but it doesn't have to be that way.

00:32.631 --> 00:34.855
Social media can be a series of tools.

00:35.607 --> 00:40.181
Tools, by the way, that have allowed me to lead a life that I really enjoy,...

00:40.317 --> 00:41.895
...that I'm super lucky to have.

00:42.125 --> 00:45.857
And honestly, it's an opportunity to practice intentional living.

00:46.432 --> 00:47.655
So, let's dive in.

00:48.054 --> 00:49.493
Remove the fluff.

00:49.851 --> 00:54.767
The first thing to think about here is that your time and attention are really valuable.

00:54.984 --> 00:58.038
In fact, it's the most valuable resource that you have.

00:58.379 --> 01:01.632
Why else would advertisers spend hundreds of billions of dollars a year...

01:01.729 --> 01:03.005
...to try and get in front of you?
