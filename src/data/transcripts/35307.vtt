00:00.114 --> 00:01.914
Whether you like it or not, we all have limits.

00:02.118 --> 00:05.019
Limits with regard to energy, time, and focus.

00:05.227 --> 00:08.849
This is really important to keep in mind, especially with respect to social media,...

00:08.963 --> 00:10.883
...and I want to give a little bit of context here.

00:11.091 --> 00:13.032
For at least hundreds of thousands of years,...

00:13.171 --> 00:17.085
...humans were hunter-gatherers that lived in small groups.

00:17.307 --> 00:21.982
Estimates vary on the size of these groups, but on average, it's about 150.

00:22.184 --> 00:24.459
There are a number of reasons why the number caps out there.

00:24.586 --> 00:26.951
And one of the main ones is the fact that...

00:27.242 --> 00:31.704
...we're just unable to create quality relationships with trust...

00:31.886 --> 00:33.448
...and depth beyond that number.

00:33.767 --> 00:34.853
I mean, it makes sense.

00:34.963 --> 00:36.840
It takes a long time to get to know someone.

00:37.132 --> 00:41.315
In fact, I'm not even close to having 150 really deep relationships,...

00:41.425 --> 00:42.685
...and I'm perfectly okay with that.

00:42.972 --> 00:44.672
However, I really like that number...

00:44.785 --> 00:48.689
...and I think it's not a bad idea at all to cap the number of people that you follow...

00:48.798 --> 00:52.257
...on any given social media platform at a 150.

00:52.544 --> 00:54.985
The thing is, we go throughout our lives accumulating.

00:55.282 --> 00:59.014
Let me ask you, why is it that your email inbox fills up with spam?

00:59.313 --> 01:03.193
It's because we sign up for the different events, offers, deals,...

01:03.299 --> 01:06.293
...depending on our interests at different stages of life.

01:06.654 --> 01:08.828
And honestly, the same exact thing happens with people.

01:08.966 --> 01:10.452
They come in and out of our lives.

01:10.650 --> 01:11.166
And you know what?

01:11.329 --> 01:15.973
At best, most of these people are just background characters in your life.
