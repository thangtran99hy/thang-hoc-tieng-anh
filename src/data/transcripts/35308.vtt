I noticed that on Instagram stories,...

00:02.055 --> 00:05.959
...I would be watching updates from people that I hadn't spoken to in years.

00:06.179 --> 00:09.945
That's mental bandwidth that's going into something that adds nothing to your life.

00:10.349 --> 00:12.680
If you unfollow them, I bet you won't miss it at all,...

00:12.827 --> 00:17.215
...and that might sound a little bit harsh, but that's honestly how I think this works.

00:17.537 --> 00:19.810
Let me just say that it's okay to let them go.

00:19.998 --> 00:22.413
If they're meant to play a role in your life,...

00:22.805 --> 00:24.663
...they will find a way back into your life.

00:24.855 --> 00:25.595
I promise you.

00:25.921 --> 00:30.195
What I recommend doing is going through the list of people and accounts that you follow,...

00:30.550 --> 00:34.852
...and removing anything that doesn't clearly add value to your life.

00:35.093 --> 00:36.943
In fact, I recommend doing this three times...

00:37.047 --> 00:40.525
...because what will happen is, it'll get easier as you go through.

00:40.896 --> 00:44.857
I found that I got more and more comfortable of this idea of letting people go.

00:45.197 --> 00:50.211
Now, this is very simple actually, but we make it complicated due to social pressure.

00:50.606 --> 00:51.461
Just be mindful,...

00:51.559 --> 00:53.769
...if you feel obligated to follow somebody,...

00:53.883 --> 00:58.367
...or if you're afraid to unfollow someone for fear of their reaction if they found out.

00:58.617 --> 01:01.372
These are not the right reasons to follow somebody, first of all.

01:01.553 --> 01:05.185
And it's important to remember, whose life is this, right?

01:05.310 --> 01:06.365
Yours or theirs?
