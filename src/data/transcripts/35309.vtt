The things that we think we should care about...

00:02.301 --> 00:05.749
...are not always the same as the things that we actually care about.

00:06.127 --> 00:06.760
That's okay.

00:07.171 --> 00:11.185
I can honestly say that I don't care what the people that I went to high school...

00:11.304 --> 00:13.465
...think about me and that's not going to change.

00:13.557 --> 00:14.359
So, guess what?

00:14.481 --> 00:16.650
I don't follow any of them on social media.

00:16.896 --> 00:19.905
By the way, I just want to mention that when I did this,...

00:20.029 --> 00:22.687
...I was shocked to find that I was following all kinds of people,...

00:22.804 --> 00:27.325
...and brands, and accounts that had absolutely no importance to me.

00:28.087 --> 00:31.219
That's because I've evolved, and changed over time, right?

00:31.315 --> 00:32.069
As we all do.

00:32.246 --> 00:37.531
I also want to challenge you to think critically if something motivates or inspires you.

00:37.721 --> 00:39.339
These are words that are thrown out a lot,...

00:39.449 --> 00:43.979
...but I think that there's a lot of psychology at play in social media, right?

00:44.405 --> 00:45.441
If you're following an account,...

00:45.547 --> 00:48.632
...that in reality actually gives you kind of a sinking feeling,...

00:48.967 --> 00:51.723
...that makes you feel, you know, like a failure,...

00:51.826 --> 00:54.238
...or that you're not doing enough in life,...

00:54.450 --> 00:57.387
...you know, then maybe it's not a good idea to follow that account.
