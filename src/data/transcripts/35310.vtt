There are a lot of accounts out there that are perfectly curated...

00:04.272 --> 00:09.607
...and don't reflect or seem connected in any way to reality.

00:09.904 --> 00:13.469
Nobody is perpetually happy, for the record, okay?

00:13.747 --> 00:16.013
So if somebody seems like that on social media,...

00:16.335 --> 00:19.306
...then maybe they're not telling the full truth.

00:19.532 --> 00:23.971
I even unfollowed GaryVee, not because I don't like his message,...

00:24.079 --> 00:27.057
...because I think what he is all about is amazing,...

00:27.439 --> 00:31.353
...and I just love what he talks about on social media and how he talks about it.

00:31.649 --> 00:33.379
But the truth is that, after a while,...

00:33.465 --> 00:37.379
...it just became a series of reminders and you know, I got it.

00:37.505 --> 00:39.288
I no longer needed these reminders.

00:39.461 --> 00:41.098
I'm sure he would approve of this decision.

00:41.224 --> 00:45.222
He's even said on social media that he's perfectly okay with you unfollowing him...

00:45.421 --> 00:47.413
...to go and pursue meaning in life.

00:47.633 --> 00:49.623
I really do believe there's a lot of quality out there.

00:49.718 --> 00:53.219
You just have to kind of dig a little bit and get through the BS to get there.
