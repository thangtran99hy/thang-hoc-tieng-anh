Help the algorithms help you.

When on YouTube or Instagram, it's really easy to tell these platforms...

00:06.756 --> 00:08.787
...to stop showing you stuff that you don't want to see,...

00:09.073 --> 00:12.932
...stuff that maybe distracts you or that, you know, you don't care about.

00:13.286 --> 00:17.570
I started by blocking sensationalized news, drama, that kind of thing.

00:17.799 --> 00:19.480
I just didn't need it in my life.

00:19.773 --> 00:23.081
Even before doing this, it might be a good idea to clear your history,...

00:23.398 --> 00:25.082
...especially on platforms like YouTube,...

00:25.375 --> 00:28.577
...as a way to kind of attack things at the source and break the cycle.

00:28.865 --> 00:31.261
Limit the appeal of social media.

00:31.559 --> 00:36.657
I absolutely hate the feeling of having spent far too much time scrolling, right?

00:36.788 --> 00:39.369
And I think I'm not the only person that has gone through this.

00:39.589 --> 00:42.913
I've successfully curbed my social media usage in two ways:

00:43.176 --> 00:48.265
First of all, turn off or limit notifications, and I totally get the irony in that.

00:48.392 --> 00:51.531
I know I've promoted turning on notifications on this channel...

00:51.771 --> 00:53.169
...at the end of some of my videos,...

00:53.397 --> 00:56.969
...so if you've done that and decided to turn them back off,...

00:57.087 --> 00:58.833
...I do not blame you whatsoever.

00:59.089 --> 01:03.323
At the end of the day I do not want to have a detrimental impact on your life. Okay?
