I've talked about this before,...

00:01.313 --> 00:05.535
...but think about how frustrating that feeling of not getting anything done is.

00:05.828 --> 00:09.927
Oftentimes, this is just a result of constantly disrupting your focus,...

00:10.600 --> 00:12.903
...because of notifications, which is very unnatural.

00:13.093 --> 00:15.333
And second, this mainly applies to Instagram,...

00:15.425 --> 00:18.540
...but I went ahead and kind of diluted my feed.

00:18.717 --> 00:21.703
I went ahead and followed about 20 accounts or hashtags...

00:21.793 --> 00:23.849
...that are run by complete strangers to me.

00:24.044 --> 00:28.576
These are all accounts that post, like, eye candy, but without any context.

00:28.815 --> 00:33.657
I find that these photos, although they're very pretty, often kind of blend together...

00:33.906 --> 00:37.621
...and they make scrolling through Instagram a lot more repetitive...

00:37.761 --> 00:39.104
...and far less addictive.

00:39.333 --> 00:41.512
I'm kind of like, why am I looking at this right now?

00:41.782 --> 00:43.869
I have better things to do, and I get off.

00:44.511 --> 00:47.068
The only way that any of this is gonna work for you...

00:47.169 --> 00:50.663
...is if you have some level of accountability and desire to change,...

00:50.888 --> 00:53.655
...which I'm guessing you already do since you're watching this video.

00:54.019 --> 00:56.628
The cool thing about this is that it snowballs.

00:56.745 --> 01:00.937
So, at first, the changes might feel difficult and clunky, but it gets easier.

01:01.159 --> 01:04.670
Just starting the process can really lead you to cleaning things up,...

01:04.961 --> 01:07.853
...and being a little bit healthier on social media.
