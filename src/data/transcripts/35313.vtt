Honestly, for much of the last decade,...

00:02.678 --> 00:06.035
...I thought libraries were extremely boring places,...

00:06.177 --> 00:08.464
...and my opinion of bookstores was only slightly better.

00:09.471 --> 00:11.931
I just think circumstances played a big role.

00:12.078 --> 00:15.556
I felt forced to be there for school projects, for example.

00:15.897 --> 00:18.434
Maybe I was just a spazzy teenager, but you know what?

00:18.760 --> 00:22.464
I've realized that not all bookstores and libraries were created equal.

00:23.381 --> 00:26.893
So, I decided to take a trip to La Biblioteca Vasconcelos...

00:26.995 --> 00:27.845
...here in Mexico City.

00:27.979 --> 00:30.831
It's pretty well-known here, and you're about to find out why.

00:31.671 --> 00:34.183
All right, that's the building right there.

00:34.471 --> 00:34.954
It's pretty big.

00:35.767 --> 00:37.621
Holy smokes!

00:38.039 --> 00:39.807
Oh my god!

00:40.409 --> 00:42.378
This is craziness!

00:42.504 --> 00:42.900
Look at this!

00:44.063 --> 00:44.459
Look at that!

00:45.635 --> 00:47.823
What the... oh my god!

00:48.277 --> 00:50.433
I'm like in shock right now; this is insane!

00:50.871 --> 00:51.825
Don't focus on me.

00:52.293 --> 00:52.497
All right.

00:52.657 --> 00:54.147
I'm just gonna skedaddle out of the frame.

00:54.581 --> 00:55.242
See you guys later.

00:56.235 --> 00:56.789
God!

00:56.933 --> 00:58.080
It continues!

00:58.404 --> 00:59.081
Check this out.

00:59.558 --> 01:00.528
I came from over there.

01:00.995 --> 01:02.115
That's, like, where I entered.

01:02.811 --> 01:04.535
It continues on this side.

01:05.519 --> 01:08.125
I must seem like such a typical American right now,...

01:08.222 --> 01:09.525
...just blown away by everything.
