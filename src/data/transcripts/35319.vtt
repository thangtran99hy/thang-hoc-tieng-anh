This is kind of a random anecdote,...

00:01.689 --> 00:04.969
...but I remember the first time I read an entire book in French.

00:06.050 --> 00:07.425
I had to look up every other word.

00:07.779 --> 00:08.887
It was a major struggle,..

00:09.144 --> 00:11.525
...but I did it and it was a huge milestone for me.

00:12.664 --> 00:15.872
Mainly at this stage of my life, I'm consuming self-help books,...

00:15.951 --> 00:18.233
...or work on psychology and spirituality,...

00:18.780 --> 00:20.767
...and it's almost entirely audiobooks.

00:20.934 --> 00:22.303
But the point I'm trying to make here,...

00:22.408 --> 00:24.187
...is there's no right way to do it.

00:24.763 --> 00:28.603
What matters is that books are, in some way, a part of your life.

00:31.213 --> 00:33.598
Learning new things has helped me with depression.

00:34.507 --> 00:35.983
It's helped me with loneliness.

00:36.811 --> 00:39.908
It's like it opens new doors when you think there's just no point.

00:40.583 --> 00:42.257
It has never failed to give me...

00:42.343 --> 00:43.930
...even just a little bit of purpose...

00:44.001 --> 00:47.594
...in times when I have felt absolutely no sense of direction.

00:48.737 --> 00:52.445
Also, you're looking at the work of many thousands of human beings.

00:53.217 --> 00:55.722
Doesn't that restore your faith in humanity a little bit?

00:56.487 --> 00:57.918
Look at what we're capable of.
