My pieces are littered with book recommendations,..

00:02.757 --> 00:04.441
...but I want this to be different.

00:04.678 --> 00:06.923
I want to spark that same excitement and joy...

00:06.997 --> 00:09.388
...that I feel when I'm consuming a book, in you.

00:09.626 --> 00:13.396
So I'm gonna make this kind of like a visual and auditory experience.

00:13.586 --> 00:14.649
I want to share what I felt...

00:14.759 --> 00:17.232
...when I was listening to four books in particular.

00:19.565 --> 00:20.128
Here we go.

00:20.621 --> 00:21.396
"Sapiens"

00:22.585 --> 00:24.294
This book is a masterpiece.

00:24.732 --> 00:28.410
Nothing I've ever read has so greatly shifted my perspective on humanity.

00:29.167 --> 00:30.817
Listening to the sweeping prose...

00:30.895 --> 00:33.451
...on the origins and evolution of our race on this earth...

00:33.691 --> 00:36.931
...felt like I left my body and floated above the clouds.

00:37.645 --> 00:40.445
From there, I watched thousands of years unfold.

00:40.715 --> 00:44.652
As our ancestors experienced all of the evolving wonders and horrors...

00:44.726 --> 00:45.983
...of what it meant to be a human.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.707
Something about this book just made things click for me.

00:51.301 --> 00:54.159
How and why we operate and interact the way that we do.

00:55.261 --> 00:58.128
The origins of tribalism, religion, and money,...

00:58.279 --> 01:00.499
...and how these things exist in our world today.

01:01.017 --> 01:03.653
I find these insights useful in my day-to-day life, actually.

01:03.801 --> 01:06.211
They kind of inform many of my decisions,...

01:06.319 --> 01:08.489
...and how I interpret what occurs around me.
