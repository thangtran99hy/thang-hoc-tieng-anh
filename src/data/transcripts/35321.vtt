"Essentialism"

00:02.043 --> 00:03.387
In a very confusing world...

00:03.516 --> 00:05.686
...where my options are now practically infinite,...

00:05.819 --> 00:07.967
...and everyone is battling for my time and attention,...

00:08.454 --> 00:11.174
...I needed an operating system with which to live life.

00:12.454 --> 00:15.463
Many times while I was growing up I felt like I was drowning,...

00:15.842 --> 00:18.572
...never able to keep up while everything flew right by.

00:19.662 --> 00:22.636
This book feels like the guide on how to handle it all.

00:23.475 --> 00:25.209
Greg McKeown defines essentialism...

00:25.304 --> 00:27.957
...as "The disciplined pursuit of less, but better".

00:29.101 --> 00:31.670
When I began listening to this book I had the strange feeling...

00:31.794 --> 00:34.345
...that someone was describing the path that I'm already on.

00:34.649 --> 00:37.575
Like flashing a light down a dark tunnel that you're crawling through.

00:37.743 --> 00:40.069
I could immediately see where I was headed.

00:40.955 --> 00:42.983
Just felt real, it felt like a relief.

00:43.368 --> 00:45.920
It felt like clarity on how to act and what to do.

00:46.845 --> 00:51.138
One review of this piece summed things up delightfully: Less is more.

00:51.543 --> 00:52.376
It's also less.

00:52.741 --> 00:53.424
That's the point.

00:54.487 --> 00:55.772
I can't think of a single person...

00:55.875 --> 00:58.973
...that wouldn't benefit immensely from this piece, this way of life.
