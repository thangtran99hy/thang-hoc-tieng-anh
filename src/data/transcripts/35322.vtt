The Dip

00:02.124 --> 00:03.904
Seth Godin is such a talented writer...

00:03.981 --> 00:06.145
...that several of his books could have ended up on here.

00:07.911 --> 00:10.065
I picked this one because it's incredibly short...

00:10.139 --> 00:12.993
...and yet it was incredibly impactful for me in my career.

00:14.341 --> 00:16.794
"Quitting" for me has always been an ugly word.

00:17.658 --> 00:19.975
I usually stick with things until the bitter end,...

00:20.117 --> 00:22.588
...but this book really showed me that knowing when to quit...

00:22.683 --> 00:24.078
...can be an incredible skill.

00:25.105 --> 00:27.446
As he said it: "Quit or be exceptional.

00:27.720 --> 00:29.037
Average is for losers."

00:30.165 --> 00:32.709
I listened to this while driving through the Oregon countryside...

00:32.781 --> 00:34.207
...at the very beginning of this year,...

00:34.547 --> 00:37.680
...wondering if posting these videos online was going to work out for me.

00:38.231 --> 00:40.404
All I can say is: "Seth, you're the man."
