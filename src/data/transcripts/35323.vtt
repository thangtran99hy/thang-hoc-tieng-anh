"Jonathan Livingston Seagull"

00:02.443 --> 00:04.282
This is one of the very few books...

00:04.459 --> 00:06.867
...I've ever read multiple times throughout my life.

00:07.198 --> 00:08.068
It's very simple.

00:08.349 --> 00:09.978
I think that's why I like it so much.

00:10.546 --> 00:12.563
This book is definitely not for everybody,...

00:12.730 --> 00:15.217
...and I do believe that it requires an open mind.

00:15.339 --> 00:18.382
But, for those that can connect with the story,...

00:18.693 --> 00:20.686
...I feel like it has a lasting impact.

00:21.335 --> 00:22.639
It's the story of Jonathan,...

00:22.810 --> 00:25.983
...the seagull that is unsatisfied with just learning how to fly.

00:26.797 --> 00:29.103
This is a bird with an intense desire to learn...

00:29.207 --> 00:31.047
...and to push limits and boundaries.

00:31.697 --> 00:34.349
This book is about his journey, the stages he goes through,...

00:34.640 --> 00:36.121
...the obstacles that he faces.

00:36.721 --> 00:38.577
I almost don't want to say anything else about it.

00:39.347 --> 00:41.695
Maybe because I don't want to give the wrong idea...

00:41.787 --> 00:43.386
...or to elevate expectations.

00:43.964 --> 00:45.968
You could almost call this a children's book.

00:46.844 --> 00:48.423
You can easily read it in one sitting,...

00:48.539 --> 00:50.809
...but trust me when I say that it will live in your mind...

00:50.889 --> 00:52.023
...for far longer than that.

00:53.116 --> 00:54.377
Just a final note about it:...

00:54.843 --> 00:56.674
...I highly recommend actually reading this one,...

00:56.854 --> 00:59.521
...rather than listening to it and to get the older version.

00:59.792 --> 01:03.055
Both the newer version and the audio version really kill some of the magic...

01:03.182 --> 01:04.775
...by adding things that aren't needed.

01:05.513 --> 01:07.829
The original was perfect as it was, in my opinion.

01:08.657 --> 01:10.619
I hope that this moved you in some way.

01:11.367 --> 01:12.830
I guess this is sort of a way for me...

01:12.920 --> 01:15.661
...to express my gratitude to the authors of these books.

01:15.919 --> 01:18.731
Whatever you do, if books are not currently a part of your life,...

01:19.131 --> 01:20.003
...try to bring them back.

01:20.353 --> 01:21.482
They will change you.

01:21.799 --> 01:24.642
If it doesn't work for you, you know, audiobooks isn't your thing,...

01:24.745 --> 01:26.228
...or you don't like one of the titles,...

01:26.508 --> 01:27.139
...that's totally cool.

01:27.380 --> 01:28.378
You know, it's not for everybody.

01:28.497 --> 01:30.277
But, all I'm saying is give it a shot.
