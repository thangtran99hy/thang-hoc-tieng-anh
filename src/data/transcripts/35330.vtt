00:00.233 --> 00:05.095
So, we're in the car and we are headed to our first destination which is Bielefeld.

00:05.293 --> 00:10.001
We are on a week-long journey around Germany this week...

00:10.215 --> 00:17.268
...because we found five, I think, four to seven vans...

00:17.416 --> 00:19.925
...that we really like all throughout Germany,...

00:20.297 --> 00:24.911
...and we decided to rent a car and go do a tour, and see them all.

00:25.139 --> 00:30.150
And so they're mainly from eBay, so who knows what the quality of these sellers are gonna be like...

00:30.273 --> 00:31.909
...but hopefully they're nice people...

00:32.189 --> 00:35.552
...and with lovely vans that actually start.

00:36.856 --> 00:39.719
Yeah. That's basically the update as of now.

00:40.285 --> 00:42.729
That's about it. We're really excited.

00:42.833 --> 00:47.614
Being in the car is so fun already, we're just in this hilarious Mini Cooper.

00:48.045 --> 00:50.763
It's the first time either of us have ever rented a car on our own,...

00:51.324 --> 00:52.477
...and we're in this little Mini.

00:52.902 --> 00:57.926
It's really small but it's really fun to be in a car,...

00:58.137 --> 00:59.915
...and to be on our own adventure.

01:00.279 --> 01:04.971
We've only traveled through Germany in like FlixBus or like a bus.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.790
And it's really different to be on your own.

01:08.884 --> 01:13.357
You can stop whenever, and yeah, it just feels nice.

01:13.499 --> 01:14.677
Control the radio.

01:15.943 --> 01:17.626
I think we're really gonna like van life.

01:19.370 --> 01:19.925
I agree.

01:22.101 --> 01:22.937
See you later.
