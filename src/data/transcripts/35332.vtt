WEBVTT

00:17.623 --> 00:19.133
Inside the second van.

00:25.604 --> 00:26.853
Get that notebook out, babe.

00:34.807 --> 00:35.617
Are you paying attention?

00:35.801 --> 00:36.456
I'm paying attention.

00:39.291 --> 00:41.445
We just made it to van three.

00:42.148 --> 00:43.543
By the way, van two was amazing.

00:43.695 --> 00:45.353
I really want it; Dana's not so sure.

00:46.433 --> 00:46.878
I like it.

00:46.969 --> 00:51.385
I just, it makes me nervous to buy something that somebody doesn't want to part with.

00:51.779 --> 00:52.562
That's the issue,...

00:52.924 --> 00:57.453
...but I think if we can figure out a date to purchase the van, and she agrees on it, thenâ€¦

00:58.391 --> 01:02.401
We'll do a full VO tonight explaining the whole van situation.

01:02.629 --> 01:03.287
It's a dilemma.

01:04.087 --> 01:05.425
So the dilemma is this:...

01:05.525 --> 01:08.249
The seller of the van doesn't want to part with it for three months...

01:08.389 --> 01:11.673
...because she wants to use it one last time for her vacation at the end of September.

01:11.897 --> 01:13.959
But obviously, we want the van as soon as possible,...

01:14.041 --> 01:16.269
...so we don't have to build it out in the winter in Berlin.

01:16.773 --> 01:17.056
Yeah.
