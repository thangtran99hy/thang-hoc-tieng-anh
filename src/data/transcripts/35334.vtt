00:01.193 --> 00:03.986
Okay. So, we've seen four vans.

00:04.929 --> 00:07.756
That one was the worst of all of them, by far.

00:08.194 --> 00:11.532
It was really pretty but the rust was eating away in it,...

00:11.629 --> 00:16.872
...so you could barely even open the door without really putting your back into it.

00:17.390 --> 00:18.398
So, I think that's no.

00:19.401 --> 00:23.933
I think we would really want the one thing I was so bad at filming yesterday,...

00:24.020 --> 00:25.484
...the first van we saw yesterday.

00:27.497 --> 00:28.630
It's really nice.

00:28.750 --> 00:33.392
It's the only one that we've seen that has its TUV and its old-time papers.

00:33.877 --> 00:36.267
So, I feel like just because of that alone,...

00:36.364 --> 00:40.999
...the paperwork has bogged us down so much, to get to even to this point,...

00:41.083 --> 00:45.027
...the thought of trying to do more paperwork, seems crazy.

00:45.489 --> 00:48.633
And also that's the only car that's being driven right now.

00:48.924 --> 00:49.751
It's hers.

00:50.130 --> 00:52.104
It's Vera's car, the second one.

00:52.963 --> 00:55.561
But, the timing on that one is not ideal.

00:56.177 --> 00:58.497
She really wants to keep it till the end of September,...

00:58.611 --> 01:02.182
...and we feel like we've been waiting to start this journey for so long.

01:02.287 --> 01:06.075
...the idea of waiting another three months just doesn't make any sense.

01:07.021 --> 01:08.484
And we'd have to be building in the winter again.

01:08.623 --> 01:10.927
Yeah. Then we still have to build after that.

01:11.016 --> 01:12.599
So, it would be October, we start building...

01:12.672 --> 01:15.014
...we're not gonna hit the road until who knows,...

01:15.103 --> 01:16.233
...Christmas or something like that?

01:16.429 --> 01:23.769
So, I think that Lou's gonna have to call her tonight, and work his charm,...

01:24.157 --> 01:27.264
...and see if we can get her to change her plans a little bit
