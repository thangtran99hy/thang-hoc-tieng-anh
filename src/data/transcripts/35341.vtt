In countries like Japan where most people still identify with Buddhism and the native Shinto religion,...

00:08.963 --> 00:12.097
...the usual trappings of Christmas are a sidenote.

00:12.929 --> 00:17.222
But there's nothing low-key about one Japanese holiday tradition.

00:25.530 --> 00:31.298
This time of year, Japan goes batty for the Beethoven's masterpiece, "Ode To Joy."

00:33.745 --> 00:35.687
December just wouldn't be the end of the year....

00:35.760 --> 00:38.850
...without the stirring rendition of Beethoven's 9th Symphony.

00:39.349 --> 00:42.763
The music is so beloved here, it is known affectionately as "Daiku,"...

00:43.206 --> 00:45.093
...which literally means number 9.

00:46.192 --> 00:50.611
The Beethoven craze began strangely enough during World War I.

00:50.985 --> 00:53.941
German soldiers being held as prisoners in Japan,...

00:54.146 --> 00:57.252
...staged the very first performance of no. 9 here.

00:58.004 --> 00:59.785
The Japanese liked what they heard...

01:00.114 --> 01:04.298
...and by the mid 20th Century, no. 9 had become a holiday hit.
