As Japan recovers from the tsunami last March,...

00:03.013 --> 00:05.605
...the lyrics have taken on deeper meaning this year.

00:07.356 --> 00:09.441
"The disaster showed us we need to help one another",...

00:09.593 --> 00:10.788
...says this chorus member.

00:10.918 --> 00:12.681
That's what this song evokes for me.

00:14.153 --> 00:16.215
Performed and sung all through the month,...

00:16.472 --> 00:18.517
...from concert halls to department stores,...

00:18.812 --> 00:24.940
...no. 9 now is a welcome, if predictable, gig for Japanese musicians and conductors.

00:25.705 --> 00:28.845
I have done this more than 150 times.

00:29.921 --> 00:33.063
Some hardcore fans even try to sing it in German.

00:36.713 --> 00:38.979
"I don't know all the words", says this 9-year-old,...

00:39.185 --> 00:40.075
..."I just fake it."

00:43.821 --> 00:49.235
For sheer scale, nothing beats the 10,000 man no. 9 chorus of Osaka.

00:50.086 --> 00:52.140
Talented and tone-deaf alike,...

00:52.552 --> 00:55.687
...all vie for the chance to stand on stage.

00:56.549 --> 00:58.807
Healing note for a shattered nation.

00:59.647 --> 01:02.216
