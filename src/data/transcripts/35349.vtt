00:00.191 --> 00:01.442
We got the van...

00:02.036 --> 00:06.228
...then we get a text saying she's having second thoughts.

00:09.153 --> 00:10.885
It's just... I don't know.

00:10.978 --> 00:14.062
There's so many different versions of the story and how it could play out.

00:14.147 --> 00:16.256
Okay, we have this girl's van.

00:16.938 --> 00:17.335
We love it.

00:17.735 --> 00:18.952
We were really like, "Yes, we want to buy it."

00:19.065 --> 00:19.855
She was like, "Great!"

00:20.004 --> 00:21.665
And then, "No, I need to think about it."

00:22.182 --> 00:23.630
Then there were some other vans that we've seen...

00:23.723 --> 00:26.647
...that other people have been like, "This is a great car" or whatever.

00:26.718 --> 00:27.723
It just needs some love.

00:28.325 --> 00:30.368
We're not mechanics, so we're a little nervous...

00:30.479 --> 00:32.163
...to buy something that's not road-ready...

00:32.238 --> 00:33.631
...and have to fix it up ourselves.

00:33.915 --> 00:35.782
And then there's the higher end of the price trend...

00:35.859 --> 00:38.461
...which we haven't really seen any of those ones.

00:38.538 --> 00:41.467
They're like 7,000, 7,500.

00:42.190 --> 00:44.765
That price range, we haven't even dabbled in...

00:44.857 --> 00:47.935
...because we really liked this other car.

00:48.650 --> 00:52.132
And that's just a long end up spiel to say that she is now...

00:52.457 --> 00:53.045
On the fence.

00:53.201 --> 00:54.151
...on the fence,...

00:54.450 --> 00:55.858
...told us we could buy the car,...

00:56.035 --> 00:59.183
...and now it's "Uh, I want you to buy the car,...

00:59.288 --> 01:01.585
...but I want you to buy it when I want to sell it."

01:02.091 --> 01:05.407
And now I had Lou write her back,...

01:05.532 --> 01:08.193
...being, "We get that you really want this last trip,...

01:08.321 --> 01:13.937
...but we're in a predicament, too, with the timing, and we're open to paying more."
