00:00.050 --> 00:00.891
What do you think, Dana?

00:01.167 --> 00:01.902
Oh my gosh.

00:02.174 --> 00:04.290
I'm kind of feeling a little nauseous.

00:04.428 --> 00:05.617
I feel nauseous, too.

00:05.934 --> 00:07.103
That was a little stressful.

00:07.371 --> 00:08.757
We just met with the owner.

00:09.695 --> 00:10.377
He's super nice.

00:10.773 --> 00:11.681
He's really, really nice.

00:11.773 --> 00:14.332
He showed us all around the car and stuff.

00:15.080 --> 00:18.331
We were kind of newbies and didn't get all the money out that we needed to...

00:18.410 --> 00:20.404
...because we thought we could just transfer it.

00:20.479 --> 00:24.921
But then in Germany, they would only allow us to transfer 2,500 a time,...

00:25.009 --> 00:27.525
...and it was already Saturday and so then it wouldn't go through till Monday.

00:27.611 --> 00:30.377
So, he was obviously not gonna give you the car...

00:30.445 --> 00:32.789
...until the money is in our bank account.

00:33.314 --> 00:33.955
My bad.

00:34.769 --> 00:39.911
Yeah, we're still learning but that just means that we stay one more night in Munster...

00:40.018 --> 00:42.255
...and then, hopefully, we can get the money out tomorrow.

00:43.613 --> 00:44.285
Oh, look at this.

00:47.071 --> 00:48.285
So, this is our new van.

00:48.366 --> 00:49.116
This is our home.

00:49.622 --> 00:54.267
So, they have it set up that you sleep here and this goes like this,...

00:59.524 --> 01:04.733
...and you can sleep like this, or you make it a couch like that, look.

01:06.253 --> 01:07.239
We bought a van.

01:07.318 --> 01:07.994
We bought a van.

01:08.196 --> 01:08.540
Maybe.

01:09.099 --> 01:11.772
Well, technically, it's still not ours, but,...

01:12.309 --> 01:12.763
...tomorrow.
