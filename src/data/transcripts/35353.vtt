00:00.085 --> 00:01.703
Oh, my heart is racing.

00:01.916 --> 00:02.529
Mine, too.

00:03.818 --> 00:05.531
It's hard to hold the camera still.

00:06.346 --> 00:07.155
My hands are shaking.

00:07.275 --> 00:07.600
Yeah.

00:09.368 --> 00:11.991
I also kind of feel sad for them.

00:12.462 --> 00:12.819
Yeah.

00:12.972 --> 00:14.660
You know, this was their home.

00:15.127 --> 00:18.131
They're so adorable and they had their big adventure,...

00:19.086 --> 00:21.008
...and it was really hard for them to part with it.

00:21.101 --> 00:22.725
And yeah, I can understand that.

00:24.701 --> 00:28.389
I can feel the transfer of energy into ours...

00:28.507 --> 00:30.236
...in that, becoming our place.

00:30.347 --> 00:34.203
But it's kind of cool because it has so much history.

00:34.289 --> 00:37.638
So many different people have had their adventures in this car, too.

00:37.733 --> 00:38.279
So it's likeâ€¦

00:38.357 --> 00:39.895
Yeah, I mean, it's 30 years old.

00:40.003 --> 00:43.352
It's 30 years old, and I feel that there's something so beautiful about it,...

00:43.487 --> 00:47.635
...that it's been passed down and you don't even know what adventures it's seen.

00:48.365 --> 00:52.255
Yeah, there's so many cute little details I like,...

00:52.369 --> 00:57.752
...like this, I don't know what that is covering.

00:59.514 --> 00:59.979
I don't know.

01:00.052 --> 01:02.202
I feel that's the beauty of when you get something,...

01:02.778 --> 01:04.463
...like a hand-me-down or something secondhand...

01:04.544 --> 01:06.315
...or even like an old film camera or anything.

01:06.423 --> 01:13.133
When you have something that other people have seen and given life to you,...

01:13.205 --> 01:17.129
...it's pretty cool to add your own experiences.

01:18.254 --> 01:19.911
Big changes coming your way, van.

01:20.064 --> 01:21.394
Yeah, you're gonna get a facelift.

01:21.813 --> 01:22.919
You're gonna get a facelift.

01:23.039 --> 01:24.090
Not even a facelift.

01:24.231 --> 01:30.963
We're stripping this to the bare bones and then rebuilding the entire thing.
