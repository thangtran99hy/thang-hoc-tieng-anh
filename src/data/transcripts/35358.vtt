Van life lesson number one: Never underestimate the kindness of strangers.

00:09.928 --> 00:11.440
Sometimes, it takes a village.

00:11.873 --> 00:13.676
Sometimes, you ask for help.

00:14.185 --> 00:16.362
Sometimes, you can't do it on your own.

00:21.867 --> 00:25.395
We decided to do our van conversion in this donkey pen in southern Spain...

00:25.696 --> 00:28.099
...because we thought it would be easier than building on the street,...

00:28.268 --> 00:32.175
...below our old apartment in Berlin, during a cold and rainy German winter.

00:35.122 --> 00:38.398
The next day started the way nearly every day would on the mountain,...

00:38.804 --> 00:41.830
...by feeding the two donkeys, Myrtle and Nush-Nush,...

00:42.237 --> 00:44.799
...and working from dawn till dusk on the van build.

00:45.429 --> 00:49.760
Turns out, demolition is a great way to learn how to use power tools for the first time...

00:49.985 --> 00:51.972
...because there's not really much you can mess up.

00:53.370 --> 00:54.623
We wanted a clean slate...

00:54.717 --> 00:58.753
...so that the off-grid van conversion we were undertaking would last for years to come,...

00:59.285 --> 01:02.266
...but first, we'd need to tackle the massive rust problem...

01:02.391 --> 01:05.049
...by removing the entire old interior of the van,...

01:05.312 --> 01:09.042
...so we could patch the leaky windows and repaint everything to protect the metal.
