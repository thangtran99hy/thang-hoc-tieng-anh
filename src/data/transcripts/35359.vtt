00:00.555 --> 00:01.685
So now that he's all cleaned up,...

00:01.993 --> 00:06.731
...let me introduce you to our van, Ody, which by the way is short for Odysseus.

00:07.123 --> 00:13.703
He's a 38-year-old Mercedes 307D Sprinter van with rear-wheel drive, a diesel engine,...

00:13.977 --> 00:16.459
...and a top speed of 90 km/h.

00:16.649 --> 00:17.933
I know, really fast.

00:18.254 --> 00:20.219
Oh and he has a knack for getting stuck.

00:20.965 --> 00:24.388
We wanted an old van because we really liked the look of those old Sprinters...

00:24.585 --> 00:27.493
...and they are way cheaper than the newer ones.

00:27.755 --> 00:32.200
Plus we decided to convert our van into an off-grid camper entirely on our own,...

00:32.451 --> 00:34.525
...so that we could learn as much as possible.

00:34.685 --> 00:37.519
I mean, there are so many skills when you do a full van conversion.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.900
And a lot of those would come in super handy...

00:39.994 --> 00:43.495
...when we build our own self-sustaining off-grid home one day...

00:43.889 --> 00:45.481
...or at least that's our 10-year plan.

01:15.329 --> 01:20.396
Yeah, I think we used up already half of the stuff, so one more.

01:52.509 --> 01:53.123
What a day.

01:53.462 --> 01:54.273
That was really fun.

01:55.559 --> 01:56.883
I like working on the van with you.

02:19.217 --> 02:20.909
Alright, should I get started?

02:21.269 --> 02:21.659
Sure!
