00:00.706 --> 00:04.143
All right, that wall is in and done,...

00:04.271 --> 00:06.069
...now we just need to start this section up here.

00:12.342 --> 00:13.806
Van-life lesson number three:

00:14.188 --> 00:18.129
Donkeys eat wood and anything else they can get their teeth on.

00:18.581 --> 00:21.299
So, make sure to put all your supplies away at the end of the day.

00:22.276 --> 00:25.057
We really came to cherish this routine during our van build.

00:25.631 --> 00:28.127
Waking up each morning to feed Myrtle and Nush Nush,...

00:28.525 --> 00:30.475
...and working together all day as a team.

00:31.375 --> 00:34.775
Before long, the ceiling was done and the walls of our new home took shape.

00:35.753 --> 00:38.837
In the afternoons, I cook us lunch while Lou stayed back...

00:38.966 --> 00:41.842
...to make sure that the donkeys didn't eat all of our supplies.

00:58.243 --> 01:02.916
Last screw, and I feel like it is starting to look like a home.

01:03.244 --> 01:08.615
Still messy but the van-life experience has begun, which is really exciting.

01:09.016 --> 01:13.761
And this is a ton of work so it feels like a huge part of the build is behind us,...

01:13.852 --> 01:16.333
...and we're getting to the fun stuff like painting,...

01:16.437 --> 01:18.867
...and building the kitchen, and putting in the bed,...

01:18.974 --> 01:21.630
...and all that good stuff that makes it truly feel like a home.

01:22.024 --> 01:25.943
So yeah, big project done, and a lot more to come.
