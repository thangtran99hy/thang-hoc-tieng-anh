Van life lesson number six:

00:14.467 --> 00:17.917
A self-build van conversion is never done and that's okay.

00:18.805 --> 00:22.425
Once we finished installing our new bed and packed up all of our belongings,...

00:22.800 --> 00:25.352
...we had to say goodbye to Alfie and the donkeys.

00:26.005 --> 00:29.575
Our time in the mountains was over, but the van build wasn't quite done yet.

00:30.356 --> 00:33.092
Every morning, we'd unload our supplies and keep building...

00:33.530 --> 00:36.355
...and in the evenings, pack it back into the front of the van.

00:37.053 --> 00:41.302
I sewed us door covers and blackout curtains, while Lou tinkered with the electrics.

00:41.859 --> 00:46.343
Weeks later, we found our own little paradise on a secluded beach near Gibraltar,...

00:46.666 --> 00:49.229
...where Lou rewired our lights and added in switches.

00:50.412 --> 00:52.089
In a parking lot in Peniche, Portugal,...

00:52.222 --> 00:55.625
...we added a vent above our kitchen, which has been a total game changer.

00:56.279 --> 00:59.649
In all honesty, we have never stopped tinkering with this van.

00:59.999 --> 01:02.789
One of the most empowering parts of this entire van conversion...

01:02.959 --> 01:05.167
...is the fact that now when something isn't working,...

01:05.423 --> 01:08.131
...we feel confident enough to fix the problem ourselves.

01:08.759 --> 01:12.123
Ody may never be perfect, but he's a beautiful home for us.
