00:01.535 --> 00:02.493
The Word Collector.

00:03.321 --> 00:05.725
Collectors collect things.

00:06.070 --> 00:07.425
Some people collect stamps.

00:07.983 --> 00:09.417
Some people collect coins.

00:10.261 --> 00:10.963
And Jerome?

00:12.083 --> 00:13.366
What did he collect?

00:14.865 --> 00:17.477
Jerome collected words.

00:18.439 --> 00:21.389
There were words he did not know the meaning of at first...

00:22.227 --> 00:24.914
...but they were marvelous to say.

00:25.568 --> 00:30.535
There were words whose sounds were perfectly suited to their meaning.

00:31.453 --> 00:37.964
Jerome filled his scrapbooks with more and more of his favorite words.

00:38.820 --> 00:41.086
Jerome's collections grew.

00:42.029 --> 00:43.835
He began organizing them.

00:44.657 --> 00:48.119
One day while transporting them...

00:49.114 --> 00:53.349
...Jerome slipped and his words went flying.

00:54.121 --> 01:00.929
As he began to pick them up, he noticed his collections had become jumbled.

01:03.045 --> 01:05.475
Big words next to little words.

01:05.796 --> 01:09.717
Sad words next to dreamy words.

01:10.481 --> 01:13.188
Jerome began stringing words together.

01:14.520 --> 01:18.067
Words he had not imagined being side by side.

01:20.278 --> 01:23.943
He used his words to write poems.

01:25.549 --> 01:28.958
He used his poems to make songs.

01:29.770 --> 01:30.768
They moved.

01:31.322 --> 01:32.281
They delighted.

01:33.369 --> 01:37.308
Some of his most simplest words were his  most powerful.

01:38.722 --> 01:44.102
Jerome eagerly collected more and more of his favorite words.

01:45.173 --> 01:49.758
The more words he knew, the more clearly he could share with the world...

01:49.933 --> 01:53.579
...what he was thinking, feeling and dreaming.

01:54.713 --> 01:59.318
One breezy afternoon, Jerome climbed the highest hill,...

02:00.187 --> 02:03.213
...pulling a wagon packed with his word collection.

02:05.123 --> 02:11.805
He smiled as he emptied his collection of words into the wind.

02:12.080 --> 02:17.685
Jerome had no words to describe how happy that made him.

02:19.336 --> 02:20.377
The End.
