00:00.307 --> 00:03.407
All across America, eccentric freedom lovers...

00:03.507 --> 00:05.853
...have been protesting to reopen the country.

00:06.423 --> 00:08.893
Now, beaches are the latest battleground,...

00:09.349 --> 00:11.659
...and Florida's are open for business.

00:11.834 --> 00:14.579
Northwest Florida beaches are back open.

00:14.649 --> 00:18.167
Hundreds came out to soak up the sun, sand and surf.

00:18.349 --> 00:19.605
I love the beaches being open.

00:20.099 --> 00:21.321
This is just wonderful.

00:21.479 --> 00:25.295
But while many Floridians are enjoying their God-given right to beach,...

00:25.673 --> 00:29.233
...one of them has a killer protest of his own.

00:29.543 --> 00:34.163
In northwest Florida, one lawyer took a bold approach to express his concern.

00:36.091 --> 00:36.740
Thank you.

00:37.875 --> 00:40.575
I'm here today to make a point that we need to...

00:40.666 --> 00:42.981
I think it's premature that we opened our beaches.

00:43.262 --> 00:45.233
But who was this strange Florida man?

00:45.674 --> 00:48.545
Did terrorizing beachgoers actually make a difference?

00:48.877 --> 00:51.277
To find out, I made a date with Death.

00:51.799 --> 00:53.173
My name's Daniel Uhlfelder.

00:53.293 --> 00:55.263
I'm a lawyer and I'm the Florida Grim Reaper.

00:55.584 --> 01:00.365
So, what are you doing dressed as Death, going to the beaches in Florida?

01:00.839 --> 01:05.057
We'll, we have a deadly virus that has killed over 75,000 people,...

01:05.257 --> 01:08.977
...and I think people need to be staying home and taking precautions...

01:09.188 --> 01:11.212
...and not flooding our beaches in our state.

01:11.498 --> 01:12.975
Do you think you're making a difference?

01:13.231 --> 01:14.816
The Grim Reaper is trying to preserve life.

01:14.955 --> 01:18.631
As Death spoke unto me about the need for social distancing,...

01:19.333 --> 01:23.027
...I realized that protesting to keep things closed could be helpful.

01:23.388 --> 01:26.247
Even though Death is scaring the hell out of sunbathers,...

01:26.639 --> 01:28.129
...at least he's wearing a mask.

01:28.701 --> 01:29.705
Stay there.

01:29.997 --> 01:31.676
Do not come to Death.
