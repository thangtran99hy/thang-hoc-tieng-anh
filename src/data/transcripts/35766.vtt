00:00.458 --> 00:03.797
The 911 Targa, still a style icon today.

00:04.443 --> 00:07.581
It's unique design emerged from a special set of circumstances.

00:08.949 --> 00:13.372
In the early 1960s, a discussion about inadequate safety features in convertibles...

00:13.461 --> 00:15.239
...was underway in the United States.

00:15.473 --> 00:17.776
A ban on the sale of convertibles was considered...

00:18.247 --> 00:20.016
...so Porche developed a new body type...

00:20.105 --> 00:22.700
...under the direction of Ferdinand Alexander Porche.

00:23.193 --> 00:26.133
Inspired by motorsport, the car was given a roll bar.

00:27.619 --> 00:29.480
Other new features included a roof section...

00:29.568 --> 00:31.674
...that could be taken out and stowed in the trunk...

00:32.323 --> 00:33.820
...as well as a fabric top in the back...

00:34.103 --> 00:36.303
...that continued the silhouette of the 911 coupe.

00:36.547 --> 00:38.284
All that was missing was the name.

00:38.646 --> 00:40.627
The first series models rolled out of the plant...

00:40.697 --> 00:43.153
...in Zuffenhausen in early 1967.

00:43.421 --> 00:45.995
The Targa found fervent admirers from the word "go".

00:46.277 --> 00:49.189
More than a quarter of all first generation Porche 911s...

00:49.299 --> 00:50.918
...were delivered with a silver roll bar.

00:51.475 --> 00:52.916
In addition to the folding window,...

00:53.187 --> 00:55.189
...it was fitted with a pane of heatable glass.

00:55.691 --> 00:59.017
At the 1969 IAA, Porche debut the 914,...

00:59.357 --> 01:01.781
...paving the way for the final breakthrough of the Targa roof.

01:03.779 --> 01:09.470
The 911 S2.2 Targa of 1970 appeared in the popular 911 design.

01:09.721 --> 01:13.727
It featured a 180 hp 6-cylinder boxer engine...

01:13.873 --> 01:17.323
...and reached a top speed of 230 kilometers per hour...

01:17.515 --> 01:19.415
...with minimal turbulence in the cockpit.

01:20.411 --> 01:22.797
Ultimately the top of the range 911 turbo...

01:22.890 --> 01:23.979
...came with the Targa roof.

01:24.529 --> 01:27.477
In 1995, the fourth generation of the Targa...

01:27.557 --> 01:30.021
...was fitted with a multisection fully electric...

01:30.150 --> 01:32.133
...panoramic roof made of safety glass...

01:32.242 --> 01:33.861
...which made the roll bar unnecessary.

01:34.363 --> 01:37.019
The roll bar made its come back in the 2014 Targa...

01:37.270 --> 01:39.217
...and with it cutting edge roof technology.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.920
It opened in a swift 19 seconds.

01:44.618 --> 01:45.657
The first safety convertible...

01:45.762 --> 01:48.218
...became one of the most beautiful sports cars in the world.

01:48.915 --> 01:50.858
A beauty from the get-go.
