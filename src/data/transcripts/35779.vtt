00:00.370 --> 00:02.533
I am the forest.

00:03.468 --> 00:06.553
I take in your pollution and give you clean air,...

00:07.603 --> 00:10.787
...purify your water and protect your shores.

00:12.296 --> 00:14.919
Yet you continue to cut me down,...

00:16.070 --> 00:19.401
...releasing carbon into the air and heating this planet.

00:20.697 --> 00:22.307
While some of you stand with me,...

00:22.902 --> 00:25.289
...most of you turn your backs on me.

00:26.457 --> 00:27.713
But I am resilient.

00:28.511 --> 00:29.502
Let me grow,...

00:29.816 --> 00:32.639
...and we can solve your climate problem together.

00:34.037 --> 00:37.077
When one tree falls, you might not hear it.

00:38.393 --> 00:39.930
But when millions fall,...

00:41.130 --> 00:44.189
...I assure you, you will feel it.
