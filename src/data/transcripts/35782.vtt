00:00.985 --> 00:00.177
Okay.

00:00.250 --> 00:02.319
So, you can clearly see some things going on here.

00:02.497 --> 00:04.261
First, let's talk about one of the most obvious...

00:04.344 --> 00:05.547
...which is the hairline.

00:06.007 --> 00:09.369
Now, even though this shade works really great...

00:09.490 --> 00:11.023
...all over Jacqueline's face...

00:11.328 --> 00:14.026
I mean, it's a perfect shade throughout the center of her face.

00:14.283 --> 00:16.735
Most people, when you get up towards the hairline,...

00:17.072 --> 00:18.998
...that skin gets a little bit darker.

00:19.073 --> 00:22.338
So, if you bring the foundation right to the hairline...

00:22.489 --> 00:24.290
...in the same amount of coverage,...

00:24.642 --> 00:27.580
...what you end up with is this line of demarcation.

00:27.849 --> 00:30.549
So, without bringing it into her hairline,...

00:30.751 --> 00:32.701
...which is gonna get foundation all over her hair,....

00:32.793 --> 00:33.635
...it's gonna be a big mess.

00:34.413 --> 00:38.025
I'm gonna show you later a much easier way to fix this,...

00:38.109 --> 00:41.853
...which is basically by allowing the foundation from around this point...

00:42.248 --> 00:46.331
...to stop and then just softly blend into natural skin color,...

00:46.433 --> 00:48.772
...and it'll create a much more natural look.

00:49.209 --> 00:52.893
But that's a really obvious one and one that I see quite a lot...

00:53.001 --> 00:55.167
...because we think, I got to put the foundation...

00:55.320 --> 00:57.043
...all the way right up to my hairline and stop.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.193
Now, when you look at the jawline,...

01:00.641 --> 01:03.034
...here's another area where we get into a similar problem.

01:03.110 --> 01:05.367
A lot of times when we're doing our makeup or looking at a mirror,...

01:05.461 --> 01:08.404
...there's a light coming down and we see shadow here.

01:08.673 --> 01:11.311
So, we just apply the foundation to here and we stop.

01:11.981 --> 01:17.069
Without blending it down, you start to get this mask effect as well.

01:17.359 --> 01:19.391
You get a slight difference in the shade...

01:19.478 --> 01:20.941
...between here and your neck,...

01:21.270 --> 01:25.787
...and it just tends to bring out the effect of a makeup look.
