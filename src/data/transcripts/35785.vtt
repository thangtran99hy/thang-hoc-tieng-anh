00:00.390 --> 00:03.134
Broadly speaking, a cult is a group or movement...

00:03.334 --> 00:06.923
...with a shared commitment to a usually extreme ideology...

00:07.204 --> 00:10.173
...that's typically embodied in a charismatic leader.

00:10.520 --> 00:13.400
Most cults share some basic characteristics.

00:14.399 --> 00:17.900
A typical cult requires a high level of commitment from its members...

00:18.355 --> 00:20.241
...and maintains a strict hierarchy,...

00:20.523 --> 00:23.367
...separating unsuspecting supporters and recruits...

00:23.570 --> 00:24.769
...from the inner workings.

00:25.540 --> 00:28.579
It claims to provide answers to life's biggest questions...

00:28.817 --> 00:32.612
...through its doctrine, along with the required recipe for change...

00:32.855 --> 00:35.709
...that shapes a new member into a true believer.

00:36.257 --> 00:40.487
And most importantly, it uses both formal and informal systems...

00:40.564 --> 00:44.215
...of influence and control to keep members obedient,...

00:44.362 --> 00:49.033
...with little tolerance for internal disagreement or external scrutiny.

00:50.318 --> 00:53.945
A modern cult, by contrast, separates its members from others.

00:54.300 --> 00:57.805
Rather than providing guidelines for members to live better lives,...

00:58.224 --> 01:00.363
...a cult seeks to directly control them,...

01:00.583 --> 01:02.653
...from personal and family relationships...

01:02.847 --> 01:05.428
...to financial assets and living arrangements.

01:06.033 --> 01:09.203
Cults also demand obedience to human leaders...

01:09.365 --> 01:11.446
...who tend to be highly persuasive people...

01:11.731 --> 01:14.269
...with authoritarian and narcissistic streaks,...

01:14.545 --> 01:18.407
...motivated by money, sex, power or all three.

01:19.848 --> 01:22.425
The cult environment discourages critical thinking,...

01:22.736 --> 01:24.487
...making it hard to voice doubts...

01:24.639 --> 01:27.978
...when everyone around you is modeling absolute faith.

01:28.892 --> 01:32.724
The resulting internal conflict, known as cognitive dissonance,...

01:33.047 --> 01:35.643
...keeps you trapped, as each compromise...

01:35.804 --> 01:38.690
...makes it more painful to admit you've been deceived.
