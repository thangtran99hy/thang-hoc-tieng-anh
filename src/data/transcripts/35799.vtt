00:04.871 --> 00:05.233
Look up.

00:06.324 --> 00:07.169
There I am.

00:08.386 --> 00:09.660
I am the sky.

00:11.937 --> 00:14.153
I am a warm and protective blanket,...

00:14.707 --> 00:16.355
...wrapped around everyone on Earth.

00:18.792 --> 00:22.628
I can bring clouds, rain and wind.

00:23.869 --> 00:25.409
I can be an ice storm.

00:27.559 --> 00:29.124
Without me, you'd fry.

00:31.003 --> 00:33.595
Every day, I am the breath you take in.

00:34.575 --> 00:36.442
Yet, you are making me sick.

00:37.777 --> 00:39.129
I am congested,...

00:39.377 --> 00:40.313
...off balance,...

00:40.711 --> 00:41.491
...polluted.

00:42.729 --> 00:45.207
You see, I am more delicate than you think.

00:45.945 --> 00:48.543
It took millions of years to get it just right,...

00:49.211 --> 00:53.793
...my perfect mix of gases, temperature and weather that you enjoy.

00:54.490 --> 00:57.485
But now, your cars, your factories and dust,...

00:57.849 --> 01:00.243
...they have pushed me past the limit.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.987
And you wonder why my typhoons and tornadoes...

01:04.102 --> 01:06.339
...are more intense, more frequent?

01:07.057 --> 01:08.697
I have become unpredictable.

01:11.197 --> 01:12.111
Less rain here.

01:12.892 --> 01:14.391
A lot more rain there.

01:15.319 --> 01:16.050
Hotter summers.

01:16.859 --> 01:17.863
Colder winters.

01:18.524 --> 01:20.749
I cannot even control myself anymore.

01:22.131 --> 01:23.166
Enough about me.

01:23.826 --> 01:27.137
I will show my changing self to you in your days ahead.

01:28.370 --> 01:30.395
But in the end, I'll be fine.

01:31.146 --> 01:32.644
Give me a few thousand years.

01:33.404 --> 01:35.587
I have weathered trauma before.

01:36.955 --> 01:39.491
I am not worried for myself.

01:43.014 --> 01:43.683
Look up.
