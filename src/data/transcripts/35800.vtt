00:01.549 --> 00:02.551
I am the mountain.

00:03.897 --> 00:05.619
I am nature's oldest temple.

00:06.772 --> 00:09.764
My glaciers and streams provide the water you drink;...

00:10.651 --> 00:13.705
...my forests your wood, your clean air.

00:14.897 --> 00:18.000
From up here, I see how you've come to treat this world.

00:19.013 --> 00:23.103
You used to recharge your body and soul in the calm of my forests.

00:24.188 --> 00:26.901
You once climbed my peaks, seeking enlightenment.

00:28.655 --> 00:32.875
Now, you take what you want and contemplate only your own gain.

00:34.987 --> 00:37.670
Open your eyes while there's still time...

00:39.031 --> 00:41.418
...because there's one more thing I see clearly:...

00:43.005 --> 00:46.559
...the cliff you're on and the rocks below.
