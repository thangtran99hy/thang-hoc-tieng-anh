00:02.253 --> 00:03.842
I am the soil.

00:06.525 --> 00:12.290
I am in the hills and in the valleys, the farms, the orchards.

00:14.087 --> 00:16.963
Without me, humans could not exist,...

00:18.727 --> 00:21.365
...but you treat me like dirt.

00:23.091 --> 00:26.397
Do you realize that I am just a thin skin on this planet,...

00:30.203 --> 00:31.619
...and that I'm actually alive,...

00:33.452 --> 00:35.978
...full of organisms that grow your food?

00:38.578 --> 00:43.625
But I am broken, aching, overused, sick...

00:44.821 --> 00:45.614
...because of you.

00:47.228 --> 00:50.442
You have withered me away to less than half...

00:50.542 --> 00:53.295
...of what I used to be just over 100 years ago.

00:56.068 --> 00:57.509
Are you paying attention?

00:58.391 --> 01:01.305
I am turning to dust.

01:03.403 --> 01:06.521
So, maybe you could treat me with a little more respect.

01:07.871 --> 01:10.211
I suppose you still want to eat, right?
