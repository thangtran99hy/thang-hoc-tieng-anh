00:06.415 --> 00:09.931
The first location is the Ministry of Communication and Information.

00:10.070 --> 00:14.209
It's a very colorful building and used to be the police station.

00:14.301 --> 00:18.752
The second location on our photo tour here in Singapore is little India.

00:18.941 --> 00:21.965
There're so many colorful houses and my favorite one...

00:22.272 --> 00:23.359
...is this one behind me.

00:27.229 --> 00:30.390
The third stop for our photos today is here at the Haji Lane.

00:30.551 --> 00:33.465
I think that's how you pronounce it at the Arab district.

00:33.562 --> 00:36.322
There's lots of shops and cafes, super colorful.

00:44.175 --> 00:47.460
The fourth place is still within the Kampong  glam area...

00:47.541 --> 00:48.947
...which is the Arab neighborhood...

00:49.175 --> 00:52.837
...not too far from the last place is right behind the main mosque.

00:52.903 --> 00:55.890
You have this gate with the mosque on the back.

00:56.055 --> 00:59.614
The next stop is the Peranakan houses in the Joo Chiat neighborhood.

00:59.865 --> 01:02.491
They're super colorful and one next to the other.
