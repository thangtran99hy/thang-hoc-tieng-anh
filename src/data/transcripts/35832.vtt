00:01.202 --> 00:02.511
I am home.

00:03.849 --> 00:04.926
I give you comfort.

00:06.072 --> 00:07.427
I shelter your family.

00:08.975 --> 00:11.184
See me for who I am.

00:12.165 --> 00:13.752
Home sweet home.

00:15.827 --> 00:16.998
I am your refuge.

00:17.996 --> 00:19.981
I am the floor that supports you,...

00:21.351 --> 00:23.233
...the foundation that keeps you steady,...

00:24.792 --> 00:26.263
...the walls that give you shelter,...

00:27.879 --> 00:29.722
...the roof that protects you.

00:32.161 --> 00:33.241
I am your home.

00:34.763 --> 00:36.819
If you don't take care of me,...

00:42.263 --> 00:44.723
...I cannot take care of you.
