S is a great letter and it means so many things to so many different people.

00:03.553 --> 00:07.840
For instance, sometimes my S means strength, sometimes my S means sure.

00:08.276 --> 00:10.193
Sometimes, my S means sincere.

00:10.418 --> 00:11.813
That's kind of my motivation.

00:12.364 --> 00:15.140
And that's the motivation I want to put on this racket.

00:16.446 --> 00:21.042
So, I'm a firm believer in being sure of yourself...

00:21.653 --> 00:25.464
...and sometimes, people aren't going to be sure about you...

00:25.774 --> 00:26.976
...or they're going to question you...

00:27.269 --> 00:30.253
...but you always need to be sure and be confident in you.

00:30.612 --> 00:33.435
Be sure.

00:35.712 --> 00:36.121
Okay.

00:37.465 --> 00:39.288
This is a little healthy reminder.

00:40.206 --> 00:41.115
Be sure of yourself.

00:42.633 --> 00:43.039
Serena.
