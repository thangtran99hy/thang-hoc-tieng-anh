00:00.071 --> 00:03.499
We are racing for a hundred-dollar bill.

00:04.182 --> 00:09.053
Before I say go, I'm gonna make a couple of statements.

00:11.441 --> 00:13.583
If those statements apply to you,...

00:15.373 --> 00:17.721
...I want you to take two steps forward.

00:19.048 --> 00:21.511
If those statements don't apply to you,...

00:22.921 --> 00:24.853
...I want you to stay right where you're at.

00:26.573 --> 00:32.183
Take two steps forward if both of your parents are still married.

00:35.801 --> 00:39.998
Take two steps forward if you grew up with a father figure in the home.

00:43.152 --> 00:47.055
Take two steps forward if you had access to a private education.

00:48.979 --> 00:50.243
Take two steps forward...

00:50.309 --> 00:52.670
...if you never had to help mom or dad with the bills.

00:54.999 --> 00:58.022
Take two steps forward if you never wondered...

00:58.111 --> 00:59.859
...where your next meal was gonna come from.

01:03.200 --> 01:06.102
I want you guys up here in the front just to turn around and look.

01:09.990 --> 01:14.864
Every statement I've made has nothing to do...

01:14.925 --> 01:16.773
...with anything any of you have done.

01:17.766 --> 01:21.076
We all know these people up here have a better opportunity...

01:21.285 --> 01:22.464
...to win these hundred dollars.

01:22.921 --> 01:25.220
Does that mean these people back here can't race?

01:25.376 --> 01:25.719
No.

01:26.585 --> 01:29.193
We would be foolish to not realize...

01:29.541 --> 01:31.187
...we've been given more opportunity.

01:31.580 --> 01:35.172
We don't want to recognize that we've been given a head start.

01:36.999 --> 01:38.483
But the reality is we have.

01:39.153 --> 01:41.841
Now, there's no excuse.

01:42.432 --> 01:44.149
They still got to run their race.

01:44.850 --> 01:46.259
You still got to run your race.

01:46.741 --> 01:48.838
But whoever wins this hundred dollars,...

01:49.247 --> 01:51.424
...I think it'd be extremely foolish of you...

01:51.678 --> 01:55.572
...not to utilize that and learn  more about somebody else's story.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.788
Because the reality is, if this was a fair race,...

02:00.127 --> 02:02.045
...and everybody's back on that line,...

02:02.387 --> 02:05.663
...I guarantee you, some of these black dudes will smoke all of you.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.668
And it's only because you have this big of a head start,...

02:10.181 --> 02:12.318
...that you're possibly gonna win this race called life.

02:13.395 --> 02:17.115
That is a picture of life, ladies and gentlemen.
