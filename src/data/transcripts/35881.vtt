The magic is in the follow-up.

00:02.816 --> 00:05.579
Following up is everything in your business.

00:05.965 --> 00:08.902
Too often, we talk to somebody for the first time...

00:09.064 --> 00:13.887
...and we forget that it takes eight to 15 times of following up with somebody...

00:14.007 --> 00:16.291
...to get them to say yes to you.

00:16.673 --> 00:17.785
Isn't that crazy?

00:18.031 --> 00:20.162
And so, I like to keep everybody on a drip list.

00:20.339 --> 00:23.175
So, the first time I share with them my opportunity,...

00:23.447 --> 00:27.707
...I want to talk to them within 24 hours to see how they felt about our conversation.

00:28.140 --> 00:29.635
See if they're ready to make a decision.

00:29.922 --> 00:31.585
And if they're not ready at that time,...

00:31.811 --> 00:34.861
...I want to talk to them at least once a month after that...

00:35.199 --> 00:36.748
...to continue to stay top of mind...

00:36.939 --> 00:39.997
...when they're ready for a service or product that you have to offer.
