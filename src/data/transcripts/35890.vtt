00:00.079 --> 00:04.141
Set the follow up appointment on the first meeting.

00:04.317 --> 00:07.355
Okay. So, when you've shared your opportunity,...

00:07.677 --> 00:10.227
...you say, "Hey, I'm going to give you some time to think about this."

00:10.531 --> 00:15.496
"I have 9:00 PM tonight available or 10:00 AM tomorrow. I want to follow up with you about this."

00:15.802 --> 00:17.377
"Do you have either of those available?"

00:18.064 --> 00:19.698
And wait for them to answer.

00:19.943 --> 00:21.995
Set the appointment always.

00:22.135 --> 00:25.963
Every time you have an interaction with them, set the next appointment.

00:26.354 --> 00:29.681
And that is one way that you know if somebody is serious...

00:29.879 --> 00:35.425
...about going to the next level with you or if they're just basically dragging you on.
