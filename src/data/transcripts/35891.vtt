00:00.144 --> 00:02.327
President Bolsonaro has tested positive,...

00:02.433 --> 00:04.975
...we just learned in the last hour, for coronavirus.

00:05.350 --> 00:10.251
This diagnosis, of course, comes after months of Bolsonaro dismissing...

00:10.641 --> 00:13.803
...and mocking the seriousness of the coronavirus,...

00:14.078 --> 00:15.827
...calling it something like a little flu.

00:16.825 --> 00:19.229
Ah, well, we're hearing a lot more of the president's words...

00:19.327 --> 00:23.666
...after he broke news in a little press gaggle in front of the palace.

00:23.976 --> 00:26.045
He did give an interview to CNN Brazil,...

00:26.388 --> 00:30.459
...and he talked about the fact that given the symptoms,...

00:31.179 --> 00:35.278
...it started Sunday with a certain indisposition as he described it,...

00:35.373 --> 00:36.879
...aggravated through Monday.

00:37.139 --> 00:38.090
He had a fever,...

00:38.458 --> 00:42.297
...and given the symptoms, the medical team decided to apply hydroxychloroquine.

00:42.736 --> 00:44.877
"I took it yesterday about five o'clock.

00:45.352 --> 00:49.313
At 5 AM, I took the second dose; I confess, I feel perfectly well.

00:49.639 --> 00:52.494
And I can tell you more; I'm the president, I'm on the frontline.

00:52.578 --> 00:56.273
I don't run away from my responsibility nor do I shy away from the people.

00:57.058 --> 00:59.911
Because of my contact with them, I thought I had contacted already...

01:00.003 --> 01:02.514
...and not noticed it like the majority of the Brazilian population...

01:02.989 --> 01:04.725
...who contacts the virus and doesn't know."

01:05.113 --> 01:09.108
But later on, he talked about that people under 40 years old,...

01:09.405 --> 01:12.646
...the chances he says, the consequences of contamination...

01:12.718 --> 01:14.346
...is quote, "close to zero."

01:14.792 --> 01:18.008
"We have to worry about the virus, yes, but also with unemployment.

01:18.113 --> 01:22.023
I know, no one can recover from dying, but the economy that's not working...

01:22.100 --> 01:24.191
...leads to other causes of death and suicide.

01:24.483 --> 01:27.147
We've suffered very harsh criticism in this regard,...

01:27.473 --> 01:29.046
...but today shows that we are right."

01:29.195 --> 01:33.895
"The fact that I am infected," Bolsonaro says, "shows that I am a human being."

01:34.138 --> 01:37.828
"Before, they said it was to be administered only in severe cases.

01:38.066 --> 01:40.956
We know now, that this stage, the chance is almost zero."
