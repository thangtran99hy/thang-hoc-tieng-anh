Hi, I'm Faye de Muyshondt with Socialsklz,...

00:07.801 --> 00:11.860
...here to teach you the difference between a formal and an informal email.

00:12.167 --> 00:14.382
While I was teaching at New York University,...

00:14.555 --> 00:18.216
...I realized it was an extremely important lesson...

00:18.326 --> 00:22.949
...to talk to my students about what constitutes a formal versus an informal email...

00:23.265 --> 00:27.811
...and when we should and shouldn't use formal emails, when we are reaching out to people.

00:27.984 --> 00:31.803
When you write a formal email, think about writing a formal letter to someone.

00:32.008 --> 00:36.789
So, you want to use the salutation dear so-and-so if it's a professor...

00:36.892 --> 00:42.392
...or if it's someone with a special title, you'd want to use those special titles...

00:42.735 --> 00:46.587
...and as you write the email, it should be in proper paragraph form,...

00:46.897 --> 00:49.949
...there should be no abbreviations at all whatsoever.

00:50.095 --> 00:53.087
The body of the email should be written really well,...

00:53.382 --> 00:55.799
...just as you would write a letter to someone like I said.

00:56.085 --> 01:01.028
So, there shouldn't be any abbreviations, no slang, no acronyms...

01:01.369 --> 01:03.571
...and as you finish your email,...

01:03.865 --> 01:08.365
...you want to make sure that you properly sign off with your first and your last name.
