Another really important note is that you use the subject line.

00:03.839 --> 00:05.832
So, don't leave the subject blank...

00:05.955 --> 00:09.689
...because receiving an email from someone without a subject line...

00:10.024 --> 00:11.825
...is an email that might go unread.

00:12.211 --> 00:15.662
So, include a subject line, whether it be, thank you,...

00:15.747 --> 00:21.993
...or whether it be checking the status of whatever it is you are checking the status of.

00:22.315 --> 00:24.300
Make sure that you include a subject line.

00:24.436 --> 00:29.983
A formal email never includes things like hey, what's up, what's going on,...

00:30.259 --> 00:32.639
...you want to make sure that you are as formal as possible.

00:32.747 --> 00:37.341
So, it's Dear Mr. such and such or Dear Ms. such and such.

00:37.793 --> 00:39.709
You want to keep a paragraph format.

00:39.857 --> 00:41.987
You want to use correct punctuations and grammar...

00:42.246 --> 00:43.977
...and you want to be sure that you sign off.

00:44.253 --> 00:46.664
So, sign off with the appropriate sign off.

00:47.044 --> 00:51.337
Kind regards from, yours sincerely, yours truly...

00:51.640 --> 00:54.067
...and be sure to include your first and last name.

00:54.213 --> 00:57.716
So those are just a few tips on formal versus informal emails.
