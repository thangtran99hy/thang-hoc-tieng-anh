00:00.052 --> 00:03.134
So what's the difference between formal and informal writing styles?

00:03.487 --> 00:04.086
Well,...

00:04.440 --> 00:07.269
I tend to be complex and thorough.

00:08.065 --> 00:10.005
I'm simple and more conversational.

00:10.829 --> 00:14.402
I take on more serious topics in a very direct way.

00:14.670 --> 00:18.359
Well, I use a larger range of emotions and show more personality.

00:19.101 --> 00:21.069
Wait, I can see how this is going to end.

00:21.452 --> 00:23.117
Let's explain this one at a time.

00:23.397 --> 00:24.856
Formal writing, you're first.

00:25.121 --> 00:26.283
Step up to the microphone.

00:29.678 --> 00:30.251
Thank you.

00:30.573 --> 00:33.867
Like I said before I'm complex and thorough.

00:34.286 --> 00:35.823
I use longer sentences...

00:35.970 --> 00:40.959
...and each of my main points are introduced, elaborated on, and concluded.

00:41.467 --> 00:45.493
My articles use full words, not contractions or abbreviations.

00:46.416 --> 00:48.293
My writing is objective.

00:48.762 --> 00:53.565
I state the main points confidently and offer a full support of arguments.

00:54.032 --> 00:56.768
I am not a personal writing style.

00:57.179 --> 00:59.381
So, there are very few emotions included.

01:00.073 --> 01:01.277
Thank you for your time.
