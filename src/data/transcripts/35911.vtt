Okay informal writing, you're up.

00:05.677 --> 00:06.060
All right.

00:06.335 --> 00:08.426
Hey everybody, I'm informal writing...

00:08.711 --> 00:11.331
...and I'm much more conversational than our former friend.

00:12.075 --> 00:14.857
Sometimes, I use slang or even figures of speech.

00:15.477 --> 00:18.214
I like to include a more personal or emotional tone.

00:18.863 --> 00:24.037
I also speak directly to you, the audience, by using words like "you" or "your".

00:24.748 --> 00:27.461
I'm pretty simple because I use short sentences...

00:27.663 --> 00:30.561
...or even incomplete sentences to make my point.

00:31.295 --> 00:36.470
Oh lastly, I like to keep it short so I use contractions and abbreviations.

00:37.116 --> 00:39.881
That pretty much wraps up my style of writing, thanks.

00:41.243 --> 00:42.701
Thank you, informal writing.

00:43.315 --> 00:45.735
As you can see, each style has their own merits...

00:45.858 --> 00:48.165
...but their usage depends on the tone you're trying to set.

00:48.864 --> 00:51.153
Think about your audience and the topic of your article.

00:51.499 --> 00:55.238
Adapt a formal style when you're taking on a more serious, objective topic...

00:55.617 --> 00:59.093
...and write informally when you're comfortable and familiar with your readers.

00:59.700 --> 01:00.269
In the end,...

01:00.475 --> 01:04.419
...you have to make the decision of which style of writing is best for your articles.
