00:00.274 --> 00:04.705
My career at NASA has kind of spanned a couple of decades at this point.

00:04.781 --> 00:08.546
I arrived with the class of 2000, went through the training program...

00:08.643 --> 00:11.934
...primarily focused on the space shuttle and the International Space Station,...

00:12.042 --> 00:13.039
...learning those systems,...

00:13.233 --> 00:15.678
...having launched a couple times on vehicles.

00:15.822 --> 00:19.037
There's a lot of work and a lot of time that takes away from family...

00:19.136 --> 00:21.987
...that my spouse appreciates, and I love her for that.

00:23.871 --> 00:28.833
On a deeply personal level, I am really excited that my son is going to get a chance...

00:28.947 --> 00:30.761
...to see me launch into space.

00:31.011 --> 00:34.691
Being an astronaut has been a little bit of an abstraction thing for him...

00:34.802 --> 00:36.443
...because he's seen me do it in old videos,...

00:36.531 --> 00:38.541
...but he hasn't seen me do it for real...

00:38.644 --> 00:41.277
...and so I'm so excited for him to see this launch.

00:42.176 --> 00:46.357
Through years of the NASA team, I'm helping to share that experience...

00:46.432 --> 00:49.372
...and teaching them the lessons that we've learned by going through this.

00:49.525 --> 00:53.344
Now, there's another capability in the US besides NASA...

00:53.471 --> 00:55.667
...to operate something of this magnitude.
