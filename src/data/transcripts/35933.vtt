00:00.053 --> 00:02.805
My mission in life is to use product design...

00:02.880 --> 00:04.589
...to promote independence in other people.

00:05.238 --> 00:07.113
My invention is called "Cocoon."

00:07.306 --> 00:09.541
It's a portable epileptic safe space.

00:09.676 --> 00:12.775
My idea was inspired by me being an epileptic myself,...

00:12.869 --> 00:14.622
...and I didn't think that should be an issue...

00:14.718 --> 00:15.986
...that epileptics should have to worry about.

00:16.204 --> 00:17.744
They should feel safe wherever they are.

00:18.146 --> 00:21.081
Science and engineering have always sparked my interest...

00:21.200 --> 00:22.383
...ever since I was a kid.

00:22.677 --> 00:25.151
AirDisc is a new kind of cooling technology...

00:25.252 --> 00:28.583
...that doesn't use chemical refrigerants as cooling medium.

00:28.817 --> 00:32.724
We just wanted to create a product that we were proud of...

00:32.840 --> 00:37.306
...and incorporated a technology and challenged us.

00:37.959 --> 00:39.868
So, we created the Nah Yeah Buoy.

00:40.205 --> 00:44.055
It's a buoy that detects rips by using a water flow sensor...

00:44.325 --> 00:47.507
...which translates the information into different colors...

00:47.899 --> 00:49.697
...similarly to a traffic light.

00:50.113 --> 00:53.941
So, if it's not strong and it's safe to swim, it will go green,...

00:54.591 --> 00:57.133
...and if it is absolutely not, it would be red.

00:58.268 --> 01:00.793
When you see bits of rubbish in the ocean...

01:00.891 --> 01:04.251
...or when you see waste, it's kind of an eye opener.

01:05.574 --> 01:08.732
So, I went on a quest to create a bioplastic.

01:09.875 --> 01:13.871
MarinaTex is particularly suited to single-use applications.

01:14.295 --> 01:17.243
It takes between four and six weeks to decompose.

01:17.922 --> 01:21.417
James Dyson Award helped me gain a lot of confidence...

01:21.824 --> 01:25.933
...in not only my work but trying new things and new technologies...

01:26.105 --> 01:28.989
...and trying to push my knowledge further as a designer.

01:29.381 --> 01:30.933
An engineer is a problem solver.

01:31.643 --> 01:34.909
So, for me, a good design is something that bridges the gap...

01:35.479 --> 01:39.091
...between behaviors, business and our planet.
