00:00.197 --> 00:03.785
If people were cars, fixing people problems would be easy.

00:04.309 --> 00:09.647
Check the engine, find the cause of the trouble, replace the faulty part and move on.

00:10.477 --> 00:12.076
But, people are not machines.

00:12.787 --> 00:14.711
Focusing on problems and their causes...

00:15.007 --> 00:17.117
...is a great way of getting cars back on the road...

00:17.549 --> 00:20.541
...but it's not much use when you're trying to help people move forward.

00:21.217 --> 00:25.022
Take Alex, he wants to step up to a higher management role...

00:25.363 --> 00:26.703
...but he lacks confidence.

00:27.555 --> 00:31.255
Some people might try to help Alex by asking why he feels this way.

00:31.853 --> 00:33.831
Perhaps the answer lies in his past.

00:34.875 --> 00:38.967
"When I was a child, a teacher humiliated me in front of the class."

00:39.759 --> 00:40.266
Or...

00:41.249 --> 00:42.805
"The other kids teased me."

00:43.712 --> 00:46.095
But, concentrating on the causes of his problem...

00:46.190 --> 00:49.507
...soon leaves Alex buried under an avalanche of painful memories.

00:50.310 --> 00:54.106
He knows why he lacks confidence, but nothing in his life has changed.

00:54.263 --> 00:55.873
...he still feels just the same.
