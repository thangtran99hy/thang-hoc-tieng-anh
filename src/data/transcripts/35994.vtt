00:00.459 --> 00:03.846
Focusing on problems turns you into an expert in what's wrong.

00:04.451 --> 00:08.717
To become an expert in what's right, you have to start thinking about solutions.

00:09.678 --> 00:11.622
A helpful question to Alex would be...

00:12.218 --> 00:16.673
..."Let's just suppose that something happened and you had all the confidence you needed."

00:17.465 --> 00:19.035
"What would you be doing differently?"

00:20.621 --> 00:24.137
"I'd have the courage to be honest with my team when giving appraisals."

00:25.303 --> 00:28.015
"I'd be able to say what I really think in meetings."

00:29.101 --> 00:32.209
"I'd be speaking at conferences and enjoying it."

00:33.630 --> 00:38.293
Now that Alex has a picture of how he'd like to be, he has something to work towards.

00:39.153 --> 00:43.700
This novel way of turning things upside down is called the solutions focus.

00:45.218 --> 00:47.211
Instead of emphasizing what's wrong,...

00:48.513 --> 00:50.785
"Why didn't you meet this month's sales target?"

00:51.967 --> 00:55.288
Solutions talk encourages people to think about what's right.

00:56.249 --> 00:59.261
"Well done for selling five Insurance policies last month!"

00:59.719 --> 01:00.983
"How did you manage that?"

01:01.319 --> 01:02.225
"What did you do?"

01:03.415 --> 01:07.035
People have all the resources they need to make their solutions happen.

01:07.713 --> 01:11.443
Some of those resources are inside them, like previous experiences...

01:11.952 --> 01:15.478
...and others lie within easy reach like support from other people.

01:16.401 --> 01:18.329
It's all about building on success.

01:18.647 --> 01:20.834
If something works, do more of it.

01:21.288 --> 01:24.211
And if something isn't working, do something different.
