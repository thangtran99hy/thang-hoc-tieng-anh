00:00.091 --> 00:01.792
How's all the working from home thing going for you?

00:03.200 --> 00:03.507
What?

00:03.598 --> 00:04.079
No!

00:05.409 --> 00:06.740
This is not good!

00:06.842 --> 00:10.871
So, Project Pandora's Box is back and we need to present new designs on Monday.

00:11.540 --> 00:12.993
Oh, and it needs to be recyclable.

00:13.079 --> 00:14.549
Project Pandora's Box is back!

00:14.677 --> 00:15.161
What?

00:15.377 --> 00:15.904
No!

00:16.011 --> 00:17.077
We can't do this in one meeting!

00:17.448 --> 00:18.263
It's just a box.

00:18.372 --> 00:20.081
But we're working from home, Bridget!

00:20.187 --> 00:23.499
And then tomorrow, we think inside the box!

00:28.288 --> 00:29.419
Come on, no one has anything?

00:29.598 --> 00:33.148
Come on, we should see the solution that's lightweight and sustainable...

00:33.279 --> 00:33.921
...and cheap.

00:34.424 --> 00:35.017
Good morning!

00:35.215 --> 00:37.417
Great work everybody; we are really making progress.

00:37.576 --> 00:38.871
Oh shoot, Vivienne is calling.

00:39.191 --> 00:42.767
Two things: the presentation has been moved to this Friday and...

00:42.877 --> 00:43.263
Friday?

00:43.687 --> 00:44.755
I have to take this.

00:45.708 --> 00:46.707
What was the second thing?

00:57.272 --> 00:59.130
I think I found the solution to the budget.

00:59.286 --> 00:59.645
What?

00:59.745 --> 01:00.120
How?

01:00.207 --> 01:02.703
We make the pattern bigger.

01:03.435 --> 01:04.492
Who's changing the design?

01:04.673 --> 01:06.589
I thought I could do it with a little more zing.

01:14.895 --> 01:16.479
I was reading that "TEAM" means...

01:16.825 --> 01:19.011
..."Together, everyone achieves more."

01:19.136 --> 01:19.875
And that...

01:20.961 --> 01:22.595
Should we tell her she's on mute?

01:22.779 --> 01:23.651
Not yet.

01:23.779 --> 01:24.079
Wait!

01:24.517 --> 01:25.064
Was I on mute?

01:26.947 --> 01:27.749
Good, good.

01:28.347 --> 01:29.427
Oh, wait, the client is coming on!

01:30.354 --> 01:31.357
Is everyone wearing pants?
