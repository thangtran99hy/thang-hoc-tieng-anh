Your network is very important in your career.

00:02.293 --> 00:04.201
But sometimes, you won't have a connection...

00:04.278 --> 00:05.551
...to somebody that you want to...

00:05.833 --> 00:08.055
...you know, meet up with or learn more about their career.

00:08.485 --> 00:10.513
And that's where cold connections  come in.

00:10.811 --> 00:13.425
A cold connection is someone who you've never met before...

00:13.531 --> 00:15.748
...and you maybe don't have any shared connections with.

00:15.945 --> 00:18.199
So therefore, the first time you reach out to them,...

00:18.562 --> 00:20.624
...it's going to be what we called a cold reach out.

00:21.145 --> 00:24.417
Cold connections are great and you're gonna find a lot of them on LinkedIn.

00:24.827 --> 00:27.309
When you're reaching out to people that you don't already know,...

00:27.431 --> 00:29.340
...you need to be professional and polite.

00:29.771 --> 00:33.750
What that means is making sure that you always tell them a little bit about who you are..

00:33.845 --> 00:35.193
...and why you want to connect.

00:35.555 --> 00:39.605
If you do that, the chances of them denying your connection or not wanting to reach out...

00:39.781 --> 00:40.830
...are a lot slimmer.

00:41.011 --> 00:43.925
So, when you find the people on LinkedIn that you want to connect with...

00:44.019 --> 00:45.001
...and add to your network,...

00:45.119 --> 00:46.988
...you're going to send them a connection request...

00:47.108 --> 00:48.623
...but you need to personalize the note.

00:48.967 --> 00:50.539
So, when you send that connection request,...

00:50.665 --> 00:52.732
...the personalized note  that you send with that...

00:52.818 --> 00:54.817
...is where you want to focus on those etiquette rules...

00:54.911 --> 00:56.686
...of being professional and polite.

00:56.991 --> 00:59.425
Give them a heads-up about why you're connecting with them.

01:00.019 --> 01:02.760
It's a good idea to read through their summary or profile...

01:02.923 --> 01:04.897
...because they might say something in their summary like...

01:05.284 --> 01:07.811
"Hey, I'm happy to connect with people I don't know,..."

01:08.047 --> 01:09.559
"...just tell me who you are first."

01:10.163 --> 01:12.228
Or sometimes, in their summary they might say...

01:12.601 --> 01:15.066
"I don't accept people I've never worked with before."

01:15.495 --> 01:18.858
And remember, with this note, you really want to keep it short and sweet.

01:19.152 --> 01:21.916
You could say, "Hi Grace, I'm Betsy..."

01:22.043 --> 01:26.122
"...and like you, I also work as a graphic designer for a startup in Los Angeles."

01:26.427 --> 01:29.447
"I noticed we're both from Atlanta and would love to connect with you."

01:29.892 --> 01:31.415
"Thanks, Betsy."

01:31.866 --> 01:34.389
So, what you're really trying to do here is make sure that...

01:34.505 --> 01:37.488
...yes, your note is concise, but also that there's something there...

01:37.557 --> 01:39.937
...that's relatable to them in some way, shape or form.
