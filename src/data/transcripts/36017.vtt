I'm Grant Imahara.

00:01.705 --> 00:04.825
I've been in the visual effects industry for about nine years now.

00:05.092 --> 00:07.426
My specialty is electronics,...

00:07.629 --> 00:10.087
...anything that lights up or moves.

00:10.201 --> 00:12.779
Grant Imahara is somebody that I've worked with for years,...

00:12.873 --> 00:15.231
...and I usually consult with him on anything...

00:15.329 --> 00:18.184
...that's a little over my head regarding electronics.

00:18.345 --> 00:23.189
He's able to almost instantaneously grasp a concept or technique...

00:23.450 --> 00:26.001
...and apply it to what he's doing right away...

00:26.520 --> 00:28.001
...and be able to get results with that.

00:28.218 --> 00:30.927
Everybody is watching you all the time.

00:31.059 --> 00:32.633
There are cameras all over him.

00:32.760 --> 00:33.844
I remember what you said.

00:34.247 --> 00:35.899
There is no dignity in television.

00:36.737 --> 00:39.281
Once you accept that, it gets a lot more fun.

00:39.676 --> 00:42.197
What we're about to do, we're gonna do for fun.

00:42.471 --> 00:46.769
We've made a career out of making what seems impossible, possible.

00:47.458 --> 00:53.511
I think that it brought about a renaissance of making science fun,...

00:53.961 --> 00:55.935
...something that people could relate to...

00:56.054 --> 00:58.532
...and say, "Oh, science isn't boring."

00:58.733 --> 01:01.344
It's explosions and car crashes.

01:01.419 --> 01:03.294
It's really a fun world to open up to.
