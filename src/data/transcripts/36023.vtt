Inventory comes in many shapes and sizes, depending on the type of business you run.

00:06.453 --> 00:08.980
There are three main categories of inventory though:

00:09.447 --> 00:11.858
The first is merchandise that your business resells,...

00:11.974 --> 00:13.654
...like the items for sale in your shop...

00:13.771 --> 00:16.548
...plus all the stock you've got stored in your warehouse, for instance.

00:17.018 --> 00:17.629
In other words,...

00:17.843 --> 00:21.070
...all the items you've bought with the intention of selling to your customers,...

00:21.374 --> 00:23.933
...either as is or combined with other products.

00:24.970 --> 00:27.283
Then there are products that your business might install.

00:27.699 --> 00:32.107
Plumbers, for example, might sell gaskets and new faucets as part of a repair job.

00:33.175 --> 00:36.167
And then there are goods your business makes or manufactures.

00:36.982 --> 00:39.811
Now, here are a couple things that are not inventory:...

00:40.192 --> 00:42.797
Equipment and supplies you've bought to run your business,...

00:42.917 --> 00:47.511
...such as work tools or vehicles, and stationery; those are not inventory.

00:47.907 --> 00:50.759
These are usually accounted for as assets or expenses.

00:51.346 --> 00:54.291
And some dropshipping businesses don't have inventory either.

00:54.523 --> 00:57.413
It's usually not considered inventory if you sell goods online...

00:57.519 --> 00:59.457
...that you never actually take ownership of,...

00:59.614 --> 01:02.412
...as in some cases when a third party delivers the goods directly...

01:02.542 --> 01:04.349
...from their warehouse to your customers.
