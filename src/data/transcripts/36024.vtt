 Now that we have a sense of what inventory is,...

00:02.819 --> 00:05.788
...let's get into why it's important to account for it properly.

00:06.345 --> 00:10.005
At its most basic level, when you understand how much inventory you have,...

00:10.318 --> 00:14.132
...how much it cost you, and how much you're selling it for, plus when it's selling,...

00:14.417 --> 00:17.453
...you can gain insights to help you make smarter business decisions.

00:18.418 --> 00:19.763
Working out your profit margins...

00:19.865 --> 00:22.780
...will help you figure out which products are earning you the most money,...

00:23.140 --> 00:24.985
...versus which products just aren't worth it.

00:25.619 --> 00:28.368
This can help you identify what types of products to focus on...

00:28.487 --> 00:29.901
...if you want to grow your business.

00:30.492 --> 00:34.065
Inventory accounting can also help you understand your seasonal sales cycles.

00:34.415 --> 00:36.981
What sells better in summer compared to what sells in the winter?

00:37.553 --> 00:38.917
You want to have enough stock on hand...

00:39.027 --> 00:41.657
...so you don't run out of popular items during their season,...

00:41.879 --> 00:44.061
...but not so much that all your cash is tied up in goods...

00:44.149 --> 00:46.397
...that customers won't want again for several months.
