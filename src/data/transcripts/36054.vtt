00:02.090 --> 00:07.033
When I arrived, I was immediately struck by the color.

00:08.017 --> 00:10.716
It was pouring rain that day and it was very windy.

00:11.146 --> 00:13.482
Just these beautiful images of people...

00:13.574 --> 00:15.420
...with brightly colored umbrellas...

00:15.517 --> 00:17.853
...and the wind blowing the umbrellas away,...

00:17.949 --> 00:20.809
...and that struck me immediately as a painter.

00:20.871 --> 00:23.588
The color here is so different.

00:27.911 --> 00:29.437
My name is Kelly Beeman.

00:29.670 --> 00:32.051
I'm an artist from New York.

00:33.959 --> 00:37.261
I've always had a certain curiosity about St. Petersburg,...

00:37.351 --> 00:39.013
...and I'm not really sure why...

00:39.199 --> 00:42.703
...because I didn't know very much about the city before coming here,...

00:42.831 --> 00:44.529
...but in my imagination,...

00:44.597 --> 00:46.093
...it always had this sort of mystique.

00:47.899 --> 00:53.081
It's a densely populated city with a lot of ornate decoration,...

00:53.859 --> 00:57.060
...a lot of sort of sophisticated-looking people.

00:59.739 --> 01:01.253
You have this dichotomy here.

01:01.357 --> 01:05.112
There's the Imperial and the Romantic and the Baroque and Neoclassical,...

01:05.209 --> 01:07.379
...and then there is the Stalinist and the Communist.

01:07.683 --> 01:13.546
I want to depict specific objects and places.

01:15.547 --> 01:18.935
My paintings of people almost making eye contact,...

01:19.735 --> 01:22.115
...and that's very, very important to me.
