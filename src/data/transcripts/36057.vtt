When I started the season, I couldn't imagine that I would be able to achieve.

00:05.558 --> 00:09.998
I just feel really, really honored to be among these women,...

00:10.092 --> 00:15.143
...and there are so many choreographers out there that are incredible...

00:15.225 --> 00:18.707
...that aren't in this group right now, but I applaud everyone.

00:18.803 --> 00:21.151
When we get on the ice, you say, "Oh wow! That looks great."...

00:21.293 --> 00:24.412
...but behind the scenes, there's so much effort that goes into it,...

00:24.613 --> 00:27.189
...and we have to thank Mathieu Caron and the whole team.

00:27.311 --> 00:29.537
And I just love being a part of this big wonderful family...

00:29.615 --> 00:30.691
...and doing everything I can.

00:30.767 --> 00:31.353
So, thank you very much.

00:31.645 --> 00:34.155
We want to thank you all for this great honor.

00:34.270 --> 00:36.988
We're so happy to have won this award.

00:37.107 --> 00:44.387
What I always try to do is respond to their expectation at 120% level.

00:45.549 --> 00:50.963
That's why when I tell myself, that this point means huge...

00:51.058 --> 00:54.537
...and when I succeed, it's an amazing sense of achievement...

00:54.661 --> 00:56.187
...more than the words can describe.
