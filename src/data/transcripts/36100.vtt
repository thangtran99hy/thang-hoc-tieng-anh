What is arbitrage?

00:02.839 --> 00:05.564
Arbitrage is when you buy low and then sell high.

00:06.267 --> 00:09.341
More specifically, you buy a low-priced good in one market...

00:09.639 --> 00:12.887
...and resell that same good in a market where its price is higher.

00:13.475 --> 00:17.812
The effect of arbitrage is to bring the prices in those two markets closer together,...

00:18.388 --> 00:21.750
...therefore making it more difficult for firms to price-discriminate.

00:22.677 --> 00:24.130
Let's see this with an example.

00:24.836 --> 00:28.065
Rohm and Haas was a producer of a special plastic material...

00:28.176 --> 00:31.305
...that had uses in both industry and dentistry.

00:32.039 --> 00:34.780
This plastic had a variety of substitutes in industry,...

00:35.137 --> 00:37.225
...but very few substitutes in dentistry.

00:37.788 --> 00:41.179
Therefore, it was less expensive in industry than in dentistry,...

00:41.728 --> 00:45.548
...85 cents per pound versus 22 dollars per pound.

00:46.209 --> 00:48.385
Of course, with a price difference like that,...

00:48.736 --> 00:50.698
...entrepreneurs started to arbitrage.

00:51.175 --> 00:52.701
To buy up the industrial plastic,...

00:52.995 --> 00:54.871
...convert it to the plastic for dentures,...

00:55.025 --> 00:57.645
...and then resell that plastic at the higher price.
