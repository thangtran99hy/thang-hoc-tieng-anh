Hello there, you've reached the voice mailbox of Ryan Reynolds,...

00:02.679 --> 00:03.684
...owner of Mint Mobile.

00:04.185 --> 00:05.861
Please leave your name, message...

00:05.948 --> 00:08.351
...and least favorite Ryan Reynolds movie after the beep.

00:09.061 --> 00:10.119
Oh my god!

00:10.243 --> 00:13.399
Did I really just miss a phone call from Ryan Reynolds?

00:13.491 --> 00:16.639
I'm not sure why you called me or who you are.

00:16.769 --> 00:19.035
You're probably expecting a lot of people to say Green Lantern,...

00:19.118 --> 00:20.804
...but I really liked Green Lantern...

00:21.274 --> 00:22.494
The Proposal.

00:22.595 --> 00:25.497
Hey, I thought you were awesome as a child actor on Little House on the Prairie.

00:25.641 --> 00:27.079
This is hilarious!

00:27.929 --> 00:31.898
We are also bored crazy in quarantine, so I thought I'd call you back.

00:32.032 --> 00:35.376
Yeah, I actually haven't seen that many but I really enjoyed The Proposal.

00:35.470 --> 00:37.037
I'm a big fan of your haircut.

00:37.182 --> 00:39.280
I actually get my haircut very much like yours.

00:39.352 --> 00:42.382
Going stir-crazy especially with a 14-month-old,...

00:42.691 --> 00:44.205
...so I appreciate the call.

00:44.329 --> 00:46.749
My least favorite Ryan Reynolds movie is probably Deadpool.

00:47.271 --> 00:50.073
I don't have a least favorite movie of yours...

00:50.252 --> 00:52.303
...because I have never seen any of your movies...

00:52.419 --> 00:53.555
...but thank you for the phone service.

00:53.645 --> 00:54.725
It's been great so far.

00:55.166 --> 00:56.639
I will recommend you guys to my friends.

00:56.713 --> 00:57.969
That was amazing.

00:58.065 --> 00:58.739
I loved it.

00:58.814 --> 01:01.207
This was great to wake up to today.

01:01.331 --> 01:02.054
Thank you.

01:02.159 --> 01:02.619
Okay, bye!

01:02.705 --> 01:03.283
That was pretty cool.

01:03.441 --> 01:03.635
Bye.

01:03.767 --> 01:04.444
Bye.
