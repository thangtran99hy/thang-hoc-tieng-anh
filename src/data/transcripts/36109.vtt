I'm so glad that we've had the opportunity to team up with Goldman Sachs.

00:03.612 --> 00:07.431
...on this important program for US and UK small businesses.

00:08.141 --> 00:10.249
Having started a small business from scratch,...

00:10.410 --> 00:11.897
...I know how tough it can be.

00:12.538 --> 00:14.956
The days are long and the work never ends.

00:15.471 --> 00:17.270
Each day brings new challenges.

00:17.822 --> 00:21.477
But, there's never been a challenge quite like the one we are facing today.

00:21.991 --> 00:26.894
At Bloomberg, we've been a strong supporter of the 10,000 small businesses program for years.

00:27.319 --> 00:31.562
And we're ready to help now as you navigate the coronavirus crisis...

00:31.825 --> 00:33.511
...and work to adapt and survive.

00:33.858 --> 00:36.985
And eventually, with a little luck, start growing again.

00:37.785 --> 00:40.091
So, I want to thank Goldman Sachs for their partnership...

00:40.460 --> 00:42.305
...and all of you for joining us today.

00:43.104 --> 00:46.106
You are the backbone of our economies and communities.

00:46.468 --> 00:48.924
And the work that you've been doing means so much...

00:49.221 --> 00:52.417
...not only to you and your employees, but to all of us.

00:52.938 --> 00:54.296
We're all in this together.

00:54.723 --> 00:58.164
Thank you, take care and all the best.
