00:27.800 --> 00:29.061
This is my house.

00:29.411 --> 00:32.001
It's not big, and it's not small.

00:32.840 --> 00:33.613
But I like it.

00:34.775 --> 00:36.197
Three people live here.

00:36.777 --> 00:37.559
This is Matt.

00:37.990 --> 00:38.299
Hi.

00:38.684 --> 00:39.264
I'm Matt.

00:40.693 --> 00:41.585
This is David.

00:42.399 --> 00:42.658
Hello.

00:42.847 --> 00:43.525
My name's David.

00:45.427 --> 00:46.185
And that's me.

00:46.444 --> 00:47.214
Hi, Helen.

00:47.431 --> 00:48.137
Pleased to meet you.

00:48.245 --> 00:49.418
So, there are three people,...

00:49.605 --> 00:51.571
...but there are four bedrooms.

00:51.743 --> 00:53.367
So, today is interview day.

00:57.458 --> 00:58.257
What's your job?

00:58.691 --> 00:59.952
I'm a jazz musician.

01:00.424 --> 01:00.965
Really?

01:01.275 --> 01:02.117
What do you play?

01:02.600 --> 01:03.422
The drums.

01:17.309 --> 01:21.284
But he's very quiet and friendly.

01:25.326 --> 01:26.145
No dogs?

01:29.747 --> 01:30.719
Sorry.

01:39.295 --> 01:41.065
150 pounds a month?

01:42.299 --> 01:42.833
Great!

01:44.415 --> 01:45.018
Uh, no.

01:45.875 --> 01:48.360
150 pounds a week.

01:51.387 --> 01:52.279
Sorry.

01:55.102 --> 01:55.998
Where are you from?

01:56.437 --> 01:57.112
Edinburgh.

01:57.411 --> 01:58.497
But my job is in Oxford.

01:58.750 --> 01:59.113
Good.

02:00.319 --> 02:01.467
This is a nice house.

02:01.957 --> 02:02.609
Thanks!

02:02.953 --> 02:03.779
We're happy here.

02:05.460 --> 02:06.007
OK.

02:08.969 --> 02:09.505
Ok, Anne...

02:09.580 --> 02:10.290
Cigarette?

02:13.567 --> 02:14.650
I don't smoke.

02:16.919 --> 02:19.540
We don't smoke, do we?

02:20.573 --> 02:21.921
Uh, no.

02:22.784 --> 02:23.640
We don't smoke!

02:24.639 --> 02:25.235
Oh.

02:26.888 --> 02:27.801
Sorry.
