00:01.515 --> 00:05.730
There are four people in the house now, and I'm very happy.

00:06.153 --> 00:06.939
And Jane?

00:07.794 --> 00:09.134
Well, we all like her.

00:09.617 --> 00:10.992
Morning everybody.

00:13.041 --> 00:13.771
What's this?

00:14.335 --> 00:18.586
It's a video film about my new house and my new housemates.

00:19.079 --> 00:20.517
It's for my sister, Alison.

00:21.213 --> 00:22.917
Oh, right.

00:23.868 --> 00:24.771
Is it OK?

00:25.617 --> 00:27.059
Yeah, sure.

00:29.263 --> 00:30.127
Ok, Ali.

00:31.563 --> 00:33.771
This is the kitchen.

00:37.596 --> 00:40.495
And who is this?

00:44.508 --> 00:45.967
Say something.

00:46.445 --> 00:47.305
Say what?

00:47.377 --> 00:48.638
It's half past seven in the morning.

00:49.952 --> 00:51.018
Talk to my sister.

00:51.616 --> 00:52.696
Introduce yourself.

00:53.541 --> 00:54.562
Go on, David.

00:56.189 --> 00:57.590
Hello, I'm David.

00:59.923 --> 01:01.511
I come from Manchester.

01:02.246 --> 01:03.115
I'm a lawyer.

01:03.295 --> 01:04.695
I work in Oxford.

01:05.026 --> 01:05.409
That's it.

01:07.488 --> 01:08.747
What things do you like?

01:11.335 --> 01:13.581
I like my job.

01:14.307 --> 01:16.131
I like football, swimming.

01:17.251 --> 01:18.755
I like a quiet breakfast,...

01:18.829 --> 01:20.614
...and I don't like video cameras...

01:21.129 --> 01:22.651
...and I start work at eight o'clock.

01:22.732 --> 01:23.721
So, bye.

01:26.793 --> 01:27.561
Bye.

01:31.926 --> 01:33.439
David's nice, really.
