Tencent is a Chinese investment holding conglomerate with many, many, many subsidiaries.

00:07.427 --> 00:11.259
They include social networks, payment systems, media, entertainment,...

00:11.409 --> 00:14.269
...smartphones, e-commerce, property, advertising,...

00:14.624 --> 00:16.293
...and there's still more.

00:16.626 --> 00:19.880
The company's stock is up more than 11,000 percent...

00:19.998 --> 00:23.562
...since it went public in 2004 on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.723
And if you've ever said the words,...

00:26.287 --> 00:29.488
"Wouldn't it be nice if there was an app that could...?"

00:30.586 --> 00:33.022
Chances are, Tencent already has it.

00:33.389 --> 00:36.318
At the center of the giant conglomerate is one app,...

00:36.543 --> 00:39.836
...Weixin, known as WeChat outside of China.

00:40.339 --> 00:42.773
Think of it like a Facebook meets WhatsApp,...

00:42.913 --> 00:47.025
...meets Venmo, and Candy Crush, and Tinder, and Amazon.

00:47.348 --> 00:50.797
And there's still other functions like booking a doctor's appointment,...

00:50.930 --> 00:53.945
...or finding out how densely crowded a location is.

00:54.445 --> 00:58.831
The number of people on WeChat is now closing in on one billion users.

00:58.984 --> 01:01.755
Tencent has acquired and invested in so many companies,...

01:01.920 --> 01:05.443
...it's almost impossible to figure out where it starts and where it ends.

01:05.658 --> 01:07.433
First, there's the social networks.

01:07.817 --> 01:09.765
In addition to WeChat, there's QQ,...

01:09.910 --> 01:13.234
...with more than 861 million monthly active users.

01:13.525 --> 01:15.952
For some perspective, that's more than Instagram.

01:16.202 --> 01:19.370
Then there's the multiple digital payment platforms it claims...

01:19.576 --> 01:23.396
...and WeChat Pay may be its first foray outside of China.

01:23.629 --> 01:25.688
Entertainment is also a big part of it.

01:26.075 --> 01:29.558
Tencent is actually the biggest computer game publisher in the world,...

01:29.897 --> 01:34.279
...bigger than US game publisher EA Arts and Activision Blizzard combined.
