00:03.615 --> 00:04.485
My room.

00:04.820 --> 00:05.388
It's big.

00:05.995 --> 00:06.901
It's comfortable,...

00:07.627 --> 00:09.445
...but I don't know.

00:10.103 --> 00:10.992
The walls.

00:11.719 --> 00:12.629
This chair.

00:13.055 --> 00:14.057
Everything.

00:15.665 --> 00:16.504
Move the bed.

00:17.363 --> 00:17.847
Where?

00:19.633 --> 00:20.601
How about under the window?

00:22.628 --> 00:25.391
Put the hi-fi on the chest of drawers.

00:25.723 --> 00:27.055
Put the chair in the corner.

00:27.889 --> 00:28.795
I don't know.

00:30.379 --> 00:31.793
Why don't you paint it?

00:32.851 --> 00:33.726
Paint what?

00:34.749 --> 00:35.733
Paint the room.

00:38.297 --> 00:39.027
I don't know.

00:40.732 --> 00:42.022
I'm not very practical.

00:42.931 --> 00:44.193
I don't like painting.

00:45.476 --> 00:46.931
I'm always too busy.

00:48.299 --> 00:49.796
I don't really have time today.

00:50.499 --> 00:51.921
I have a lunch appointment at one o'clock.

00:53.477 --> 00:54.238
It's impossible!

00:55.546 --> 00:56.693
Can we do it for you?

01:00.685 --> 01:01.506
Really?

01:03.017 --> 01:03.255
Yes.

01:03.929 --> 01:04.500
Yeah.

01:06.123 --> 01:06.969
Are you sure?

01:07.740 --> 01:08.981
Of course we're sure.

01:10.746 --> 01:11.624
What about the color?

01:12.789 --> 01:14.081
Oh, I don't know.

01:19.199 --> 01:20.570
Something nice.

01:28.533 --> 01:29.527
Now, don't worry.

01:30.371 --> 01:31.217
You go out.

01:31.544 --> 01:33.969
Enjoy your lunch and leave it with us.

01:35.040 --> 01:35.746
Thank you.

01:40.247 --> 01:41.059
Okay.

01:41.507 --> 01:42.860
Let's go and buy some paint.

01:44.974 --> 01:46.309
Matt, do you want to come?

01:47.225 --> 01:47.878
Yeah.

01:49.118 --> 01:50.270
Do you want to get dressed?

01:51.519 --> 01:52.100
Oh.

01:52.377 --> 01:52.834
Right.
