Motivation has gotten you through every win, loss, good day and bad.

00:12.976 --> 00:16.951
So, as you approach your big moment, breathe in the wins.

00:17.643 --> 00:19.203
Breathe out the losses.

00:21.329 --> 00:23.396
You will fall short of your goals,...

00:24.115 --> 00:25.861
...and you will get frustrated,...

00:30.019 --> 00:35.046
...but those are the moments where you must use the past to keep yourself looking forward.

00:37.465 --> 00:40.275
Take what you can use from the negative experience...

00:40.815 --> 00:45.380
...then quickly recall the last time this happened and how you pushed through.

00:48.050 --> 00:51.561
Use your own history of perseverance as motivation.

00:56.207 --> 00:58.967
Never let your missteps have power over you.

01:00.095 --> 01:03.975
Each time you fall short of your goals, learn from it,...

01:04.719 --> 01:10.613
...and let it go so you can return focus to the thrill of accomplishing your goal.

01:14.835 --> 01:18.686
Each time you succeed, listen to your favorite playlist.

01:19.757 --> 01:22.493
Connect the music to the feeling of success.

01:23.557 --> 01:26.913
Every time you hear it, it will remind you of that feeling...

01:27.949 --> 01:29.665
...and push you even harder.

01:34.785 --> 01:38.265
With every accomplishment, stop and relish the moment,...

01:39.470 --> 01:43.599
...so you can relive it the next time you are faced with the same challenge.

01:45.209 --> 01:50.949
Skill can get you the win, but your motivational methods get you to an elite level.

01:52.487 --> 01:55.440
To keep winning, you have to keep going.

01:57.237 --> 02:00.283
To keep going, you have to keep pushing,...

02:02.140 --> 02:09.459
...and to keep pushing, you have to be able to lock in your motivation anytime, anywhere.

02:10.256 --> 02:11.971
Let go of your losses.

02:12.977 --> 02:14.254
Recall your wins.

02:15.707 --> 02:21.289
Once you master that skill, you will always be a step ahead as you chase your dream.
