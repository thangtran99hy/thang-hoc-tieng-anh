At Rolls-Royce, when conceiving new Ghost,...

00:04.281 --> 00:07.992
...our team kept returning to this phrase: Post Opulence.

00:08.509 --> 00:13.412
As a designer, when I imagine this movement I think of The Shard on London South Bank.

00:14.076 --> 00:18.175
It's the polar opposite of the opulent baroque buildings that it overlooks.

00:18.865 --> 00:21.040
It's perfectly minimal and linear,...

00:21.573 --> 00:25.516
...yet by cleverly using reflection and light, it doesn't feel clinical.

00:26.356 --> 00:29.495
It doesn't expend any excess energy to define itself.

00:30.464 --> 00:33.437
This is exactly what our Ghost clients asked us to create.

00:34.097 --> 00:35.757
They didn't want grandeur or fuss.

00:36.347 --> 00:38.061
They wanted something pure and clean.

00:38.737 --> 00:41.195
We removed all unnecessary design.

00:41.624 --> 00:42.883
We deleted shut lines.

00:43.017 --> 00:44.793
We pursued a minimal aesthetic...

00:45.199 --> 00:49.267
...whilst ensuring that the new Ghost was unmistakably a Rolls-Royce.

00:49.933 --> 00:50.789
And along the way,...

00:50.943 --> 00:56.156
...we discovered that creating perfect simplicity is really, really complex.

00:57.159 --> 01:00.639
To achieve it on new Ghost, we had to take huge steps,...

01:01.415 --> 01:03.509
...such as hand welding aluminium bodies...

01:03.983 --> 01:07.649
...and sewing incredibly long perfectly straight stitch lines.

01:08.059 --> 01:10.857
We had to find futuristic new materials.

01:11.517 --> 01:12.462
And to complement this,...

01:12.574 --> 01:15.867
...our engineers completely reconfigured our Rolls-Royce architecture.

01:16.349 --> 01:18.187
They distilled the experience of Ghost,...

01:18.605 --> 01:22.499
...imbuing it with an incredibly pure and refined driving personality.

01:23.678 --> 01:25.771
Because this particular group of our clients...

01:26.175 --> 01:28.788
..expressed a desire for something even more refined...

01:29.203 --> 01:31.753
...and even more pure than their existing Ghost.

01:32.665 --> 01:36.454
But still, in every respect, a true Rolls-Royce.
