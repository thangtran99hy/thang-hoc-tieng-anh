00:04.764 --> 00:05.903
This is how it started.

00:08.499 --> 00:12.101
Another exciting evening at 53 Blackwood Road.

00:21.900 --> 00:22.751
Hi, Julia.

00:22.929 --> 00:23.301
How are you?

00:25.431 --> 00:26.117
Yeah, sure.

00:35.487 --> 00:36.431
When's your birthday?

00:37.110 --> 00:38.377
The 4th of August.

00:39.670 --> 00:40.587
That's Leo.

00:42.121 --> 00:42.995
You're a lion.

00:45.649 --> 00:46.332
What's wrong?

00:46.659 --> 00:47.259
Nothing.

00:49.676 --> 00:50.249
What about you?

00:51.400 --> 00:52.987
My birthday's the 16th of March.

00:53.487 --> 00:54.489
I'm a Pisces.

00:54.949 --> 00:55.533
A fish.

01:04.755 --> 01:06.928
What's the horoscope sign for this month?

01:07.919 --> 01:08.524
May?

01:09.853 --> 01:10.949
The first part is Taurus.

01:11.585 --> 01:11.979
The bull.

01:12.729 --> 01:14.058
So, Jane's a bull.

01:15.196 --> 01:16.803
Is Jane's birthday this month?

01:18.093 --> 01:18.465
When?

01:19.167 --> 01:19.774
The 13th.

01:22.456 --> 01:23.639
The 13th of May?

01:23.921 --> 01:25.459
But it's the 11th of May today!

01:26.361 --> 01:27.281
That's in two days.

01:27.851 --> 01:28.561
Are you sure?

01:29.201 --> 01:30.009
That's what she said.

01:31.890 --> 01:32.804
Did you hear?

01:33.827 --> 01:34.247
No.

01:35.345 --> 01:37.172
It's Jane's birthday on Saturday.

01:39.632 --> 01:41.173
Why don't we have a party?

01:42.397 --> 01:43.150
In two days?

01:43.695 --> 01:44.191
Yeah.

01:44.323 --> 01:45.820
A surprise party.

01:46.777 --> 01:47.425
Good idea.

01:49.292 --> 01:49.773
Right.

01:50.529 --> 01:51.489
How many people?

01:52.753 --> 01:53.745
Just the four of us.

01:54.177 --> 02:00.439
A meal, a cake, something to drink, presents.

02:02.287 --> 02:05.150
Okay, let's make a shopping list.
