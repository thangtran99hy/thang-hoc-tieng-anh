00:03.867 --> 00:05.658
This is the Nike Flight Ball.

00:07.969 --> 00:10.953
It has 30 percent truer flight than our previous ball.

00:17.596 --> 00:20.023
Consistency, consistency, consistency.

00:21.173 --> 00:24.838
Some of the top players will be knocking the ball around 60 miles an hour.

00:25.716 --> 00:27.198
They want to know where they're putting it,...

00:27.543 --> 00:31.271
...so the ball has got to keep pace with, or if not, faster than the game.

00:33.197 --> 00:33.969
Footballers.

00:34.259 --> 00:35.350
A ton of footballers.

00:36.498 --> 00:39.425
We listen to the voice of the athlete, gather that information,...

00:39.701 --> 00:43.101
...and then put coordinates and such into the robot.

00:47.195 --> 00:49.856
That robot allowed us to continuously test...

00:50.049 --> 00:53.405
...and have the same track system we had on pitch in the lab.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.431
When a smooth surface passes through the air,...

01:08.589 --> 01:10.909
...the air will grip that surface and cause distortion.

01:11.419 --> 01:13.687
When we apply the AerowSculpt technology,...

01:13.845 --> 01:17.913
...it allows us 30 percent truer flight and consistency that we're looking for in the ball.
