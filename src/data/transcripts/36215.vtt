00:02.195 --> 00:03.948
We're all cleaning the house today.

00:04.678 --> 00:06.303
We don't clean it every Saturday,...

00:06.967 --> 00:08.185
...but today is different.

00:08.843 --> 00:10.972
Jane's sister is coming to visit.

00:14.944 --> 00:16.157
What does your sister do?

00:16.913 --> 00:17.780
She's a student.

00:18.671 --> 00:19.749
What's she studying?

00:20.321 --> 00:21.128
Film Studies.

00:21.809 --> 00:23.633
Gosh, that sounds interesting.

00:26.026 --> 00:26.361
There.

00:26.855 --> 00:27.407
Finished.

00:28.839 --> 00:30.103
Actually, there's a...

00:33.672 --> 00:35.153
What time is she arriving?

00:35.515 --> 00:36.279
2:30.

00:37.252 --> 00:39.666
I'm going to my yoga class and then I'm meeting her at the station.

00:48.303 --> 00:49.049
Hello?

00:50.465 --> 00:51.338
Can you turn that off?

00:51.595 --> 00:52.053
What?

00:52.278 --> 00:52.997
Can you turn that off?

00:53.431 --> 00:55.633
Hang on a minute; what did you say?

00:56.107 --> 00:56.409
Never mind.

00:56.919 --> 00:57.339
Hello?

00:58.049 --> 00:59.595
Hello, can I speak to Jane, please?

01:00.016 --> 01:00.807
Certainly, who's calling?

01:01.751 --> 01:02.863
It's Alison, her sister.

01:04.109 --> 01:04.727
Just a moment.

01:05.603 --> 01:07.743
Jane, it's your sister.
