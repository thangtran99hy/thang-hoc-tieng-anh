00:06.180 --> 00:08.157
What immediately struck me was the fact...

00:08.261 --> 00:10.561
...that there were less machines and more humans.

00:10.724 --> 00:12.795
I suppose that's the feeling that you get…

00:12.973 --> 00:15.358
...when you're wearing a Chanel garment.

00:15.615 --> 00:19.311
It's beautiful, but there's an extra touch to it,...

00:19.550 --> 00:21.283
...and I suppose it's the human touch.

00:23.379 --> 00:24.005
Amazing.

00:24.882 --> 00:27.495
You know, it takes a team to build a dream.

00:27.921 --> 00:29.221
You know, people work hand in hand,...

00:29.325 --> 00:31.256
...and they're all focused on one common goal,...

00:31.521 --> 00:33.302
...whatever that particular North Star is.

00:33.423 --> 00:36.491
Here, I would say it's effortless excellence.

00:37.197 --> 00:39.399
It's like a guild that's filled of just artists...

00:39.509 --> 00:43.213
...who take time and skill set, precision,...

00:43.348 --> 00:46.009
...passion, connection among others,...

00:46.327 --> 00:49.249
...to make something as simple as this.

00:49.903 --> 00:53.320
It's not simple, but it looks effortless is the point,...

00:53.860 --> 00:56.271
...and that takes a tremendous amount of talent...

00:56.394 --> 00:59.192
...and hours and hours and hours of practice.

00:59.579 --> 01:01.091
In my world, it's the same thing.

01:01.908 --> 01:04.653
It's just a different skill set.

01:09.095 --> 01:09.695
It's beautiful.

01:11.167 --> 01:13.093
You know, the collection of these maisons...

01:13.211 --> 01:15.787
...sort of complete the kingdom of Chanel,...

01:16.022 --> 01:18.494
...and I think that just makes them unique,...

01:18.612 --> 01:24.053
…because they understood the importance of preservation of the skill.

01:24.565 --> 01:26.931
I think that's what makes Chanel the kingdom that it is.

01:28.723 --> 01:32.616
There's something very beautiful about preserving the arts.

01:32.850 --> 01:36.837
You know, it's the secrets of the methods and processes...

01:36.978 --> 01:39.250
...that get lost as time goes on,...

01:39.459 --> 01:44.083
...and I think Chanel is very wise to preserve this place and teach.

01:44.491 --> 01:46.671
You know, so people could come and learn the craft.

01:47.015 --> 01:47.895
It's a beautiful thing.
