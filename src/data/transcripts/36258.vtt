00:01.869 --> 00:02.505
What do you love?

00:03.439 --> 00:04.002
What do you fear?

00:04.758 --> 00:06.352
What would you like to change in the world?

00:07.232 --> 00:09.587
My name's Kevin Macdonald and I'm a film director...

00:09.977 --> 00:11.579
...and I'd like to make a film with you.

00:12.621 --> 00:17.249
On July 25th, take your camera, film your day and tell your story.

00:19.931 --> 00:24.097
It's called Life in a Day 2020 and it's a crowd-sourced documentary.

00:24.647 --> 00:26.857
A portrait of the world on a single day.

00:27.471 --> 00:30.547
Everybody and anybody is relevant to this film...

00:30.893 --> 00:32.714
...no matter what your experience is.

00:34.073 --> 00:36.516
This is actually a sequel to a film we made 10 years ago.

00:37.276 --> 00:39.424
July 24th, 2010.

00:41.210 --> 00:43.757
The first time was a statement of where we were then...

00:44.297 --> 00:46.569
...and this will be a statement of where we are now.

00:48.525 --> 00:51.161
You don't need me to tell you that this has been an extraordinary year.

00:51.730 --> 00:54.935
There are so many huge important things going on in the world...

00:55.054 --> 00:57.215
...and that might be reflected in what you film.

00:58.125 --> 01:01.681
But what's going to be of interest to you might be something more intimate,...

01:02.421 --> 01:03.422
...something more personal.

01:03.875 --> 01:07.343
Today we're going to video Sacha's first ever shave.

01:07.484 --> 01:10.645
What's important to you in your life, your specific life.

01:10.813 --> 01:14.695
What we don't want is the glossy, perfect social media version of you.

01:14.953 --> 01:16.949
We want authenticity, we want reality.

01:18.404 --> 01:20.462
My advice is just do it.

01:21.695 --> 01:24.493
The film will then be shown at Sundance Film Festival...

01:24.746 --> 01:27.259
...and will be available for everyone to see on YouTube.

01:29.140 --> 01:31.832
This film is going to be something we hope you'll look back on...

01:32.003 --> 01:34.514
...and say "Oh, that's what it was like in 2020."
