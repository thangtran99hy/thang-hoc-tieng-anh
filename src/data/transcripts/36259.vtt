00:00.056 --> 00:01.780
We're going back to Mars.

00:02.084 --> 00:02.681
That's right.

00:03.060 --> 00:06.559
NASA is sending a new rover to explore the red planet...

00:06.877 --> 00:12.586
...and after a seven month journey, it only takes seven minutes to reach the surface.

00:12.953 --> 00:15.225
The landing site is Jezero Crater.

00:15.487 --> 00:18.501
A giant basin that once contained water.

00:18.978 --> 00:22.165
Our new rover's name is Perseverance.

00:22.603 --> 00:25.742
Perseverance will search for signs of ancient life...

00:25.953 --> 00:28.749
...and collect samples for possible return to earth.

00:28.943 --> 00:31.441
This time our rover will not be alone.

00:31.671 --> 00:33.351
Nope! They brought a friend...

00:33.544 --> 00:35.909
...a little helicopter named Ingenuity.

00:36.425 --> 00:39.764
Ingenuity will test the first powered flight on Mars...

00:40.066 --> 00:42.739
...which could assist future Mars rovers.

00:43.307 --> 00:49.247
On July 30th, join NASA in wishing Perseverance and Ingenuity "Bon Voyage"

00:49.447 --> 00:51.565
...on their exciting adventure to Mars.
