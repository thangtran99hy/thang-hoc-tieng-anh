00:00.497 --> 00:01.901
When you invest in a stock,...

00:02.139 --> 00:05.739
...you're taking a risk that the value may go down rather than up.

00:06.289 --> 00:07.481
Okay, we get it.

00:07.711 --> 00:08.985
Investing can be risky.

00:09.320 --> 00:14.211
One way to manage that risk is to learn about asset allocation and diversification.

00:14.585 --> 00:18.439
Asset allocation is financial lingo for how you distribute your money...

00:18.647 --> 00:21.501
...across types of investment like the strategic decision...

00:21.595 --> 00:24.559
...of which baskets to put your eggs in and how many.

00:24.781 --> 00:27.422
The different baskets are called asset classes.

00:27.666 --> 00:29.445
To help you decide where to put your eggs,...

00:29.676 --> 00:33.036
...ask yourself how much time do you have before you need to use your money,...

00:33.313 --> 00:37.703
...how comfortable are you with risk, and how does your current financial situation look.

00:38.127 --> 00:42.590
Diversification is about strategically putting the right mix of different eggs...

00:42.751 --> 00:43.896
...in each of your baskets.

00:44.143 --> 00:47.131
The key is that you shouldn't invest all your money in one company,...

00:47.371 --> 00:50.014
...one industry, one country, one anything.

00:50.299 --> 00:53.495
Ideally, you want your investments to be negatively correlated,...

00:53.646 --> 00:56.290
...so when one is going down, another is going up.

00:56.843 --> 00:59.449
Here are some typical ways to diversify your portfolio:...

00:59.807 --> 01:02.245
...invest in companies in different countries,...

01:02.645 --> 01:05.655
...own stock in small and large companies,...

01:05.786 --> 01:08.905
...and invest in companies in a variety of industries.

01:09.299 --> 01:11.845
One downside to diversification is...

01:12.050 --> 01:14.194
...if one of your investments does very well,...

01:14.373 --> 01:16.829
...you won't make as much as if it was your only investment.

01:17.179 --> 01:19.944
Conversely, if you owned only one stock...

01:20.099 --> 01:21.951
...and the company went out of business,...

01:22.146 --> 01:25.036
...you will lose more money than if you had diversified your money.

01:25.299 --> 01:27.522
Diversification won't eliminate risk...

01:27.655 --> 01:29.715
...but it's a smart way to manage risk...

01:29.898 --> 01:32.065
...while allowing you to build your portfolio.
