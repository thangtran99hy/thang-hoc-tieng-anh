00:01.089 --> 00:04.187
The first step in the process is to test the vaccine in a lab...

00:04.252 --> 00:06.371
...on either human cells or on animals,...

00:06.819 --> 00:08.671
...just to see if it causes any harm.

00:09.300 --> 00:11.189
This is called the preclinical phase.

00:12.199 --> 00:15.108
If it passes that test, it enters human trials.

00:15.340 --> 00:17.796
This is the longest and most important part.

00:18.601 --> 00:22.859
If it passes human trials, the vaccine gets licensed by regulators...

00:23.182 --> 00:26.337
...and can be manufactured and distributed to the public.

00:27.901 --> 00:30.195
Human trials typically have three phases,...

00:30.353 --> 00:33.281
...each one testing a larger and larger group of people.

00:34.449 --> 00:38.010
Phase 1 involves a very small group of people, maybe 50,...

00:38.390 --> 00:40.697
...and mainly tests if the vaccine is safe.

00:41.245 --> 00:44.269
Phase 2 usually involves a few hundred participants.

00:44.710 --> 00:47.625
This is where we start learning if the vaccine actually works.

00:48.833 --> 00:51.922
And there's the final test: the Phase 3 trial.

00:52.205 --> 00:56.994
It's expensive, it takes time, it requires tens of thousands of volunteers,...

00:57.209 --> 01:00.962
...and it involves as broad a cross-section of participants as possible,

01:01.955 --> 01:07.259
The entire process of developing a vaccine usually takes around 10 years,...

01:07.635 --> 01:12.389
...but many COVID-19 vaccine developers are racing to compress this entire process...

01:12.757 --> 01:14.423
...into about a year and a half.

01:15.958 --> 01:19.159
One way they're doing this is to overlap the different phases,...

01:19.250 --> 01:21.729
...conducting several different trials at once,...

01:22.447 --> 01:24.961
...or, to ramp up the manufacturing of a vaccine...

01:25.033 --> 01:26.300
...while it's still being tested,...

01:26.408 --> 01:29.026
...so that if it works, it can be distributed right away.
