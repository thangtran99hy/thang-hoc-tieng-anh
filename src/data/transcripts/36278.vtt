00:00.535 --> 00:04.531
Japanese leader Shinzo Abe resigned on Friday over health issues....

00:04.639 --> 00:05.711
...that's grown worse.

00:05.995 --> 00:08.772
Abe is Japan's longest-serving prime minister...

00:08.932 --> 00:13.312
...and has, for years, battled ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease.

00:13.696 --> 00:16.771
Two recent hospital visits within a week sparked speculation...

00:16.869 --> 00:19.373
...as to whether he could stay in his job as prime minister...

00:19.627 --> 00:21.061
...until September next year...

00:21.280 --> 00:24.161
...when his term as leader of the Liberal Democracy Party ends.

00:24.424 --> 00:27.586
This is actually Abe's second term as prime minister.

00:27.730 --> 00:30.523
He resigned in 2007 citing health reasons...

00:30.598 --> 00:34.254
...and after a year of scandals, then he returned in 2012.

00:34.639 --> 00:37.976
Abe's recently seen his support fall to one of the lowest levels...

00:38.071 --> 00:40.120
...of his nearly eight years in office,...

00:40.303 --> 00:43.521
...under fire for his handling of the novel coronavirus pandemic...

00:43.649 --> 00:45.916
...and more scandals among party members.

00:46.339 --> 00:49.565
Abe's resignation will trigger a leadership race in the party,...

00:49.746 --> 00:52.547
...the winner of which must be formally elected in parliament.
