00:00.867 --> 00:04.106
Graduating class, hear me well on this day.

00:05.099 --> 00:07.481
On this day, when you have reached the hilltop...

00:08.015 --> 00:14.630
...and you are deciding on next jobs, next steps, careers, further education,...

00:15.598 --> 00:20.151
...you would rather find purpose than a job or career.

00:21.605 --> 00:23.549
Purpose crosses disciplines.

00:24.608 --> 00:27.029
Purpose is an essential element of you.

00:27.634 --> 00:31.278
It is the reason you are on the planet at this particular time in history.

00:32.077 --> 00:35.797
Your very existence is wrapped up in the things you are here to fulfill.

00:36.549 --> 00:40.934
Whatever you choose for a career path, remember the struggles along the way...

00:41.157 --> 00:44.313
...are only meant to shape you for your purpose.

00:45.645 --> 00:49.317
When I dared to challenge the system that would relegate us...

00:49.427 --> 00:53.862
...to victims and stereotypes with no clear historical backgrounds,...

00:53.995 --> 00:57.633
...no hopes or talents, when I questioned that method of portrayal,...

00:58.025 --> 01:00.681
...a different path opened up for me.

01:01.924 --> 01:03.824
I don't know what your future is,...

01:04.971 --> 01:07.209
...but if you are willing to take the harder way,...

01:08.162 --> 01:09.769
...the more complicated one,...

01:09.863 --> 01:13.192
...the one with more failures at first than successes,...

01:13.697 --> 01:16.877
...the one that has ultimately proven to have more meaning,...

01:16.955 --> 01:21.187
...more victory, more glory, then you will not regret it.

01:22.172 --> 01:25.048
Now, this is your time.

01:30.395 --> 01:33.825
The light of new realization shines on you today.

01:34.533 --> 01:38.652
Howard's legacy is not wrapped up in the money that you will make...

01:39.169 --> 01:42.125
...but the challenges that you choose to confront.

01:43.289 --> 01:47.276
As you commit to your past, press on with pride...

01:48.395 --> 01:50.555
...and press on with purpose.

01:51.679 --> 01:52.641
God bless you.

01:53.601 --> 01:54.839
I love you, Howard.

01:57.824 --> 01:58.695
Howard forever.
