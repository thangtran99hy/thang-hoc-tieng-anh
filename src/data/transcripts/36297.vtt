This is a perfect collision of authenticity from the court, from the game...

00:05.188 --> 00:08.602
...and then you're mixing this up with luxury and craft...

00:08.716 --> 00:10.814
...to a level that has never been done before.

00:11.119 --> 00:13.325
The choices of material, for example,...

00:13.460 --> 00:15.831
...it's a material that we have never used.

00:17.643 --> 00:21.412
When we started doing the Jordan, I was like, it has to be Dior Gray.

00:21.555 --> 00:22.960
It's the Mister Dior color.

00:23.074 --> 00:27.267
And there is this little clin d'oeil to one AJ1 that is the neutral gray.

00:33.769 --> 00:35.668
Basically, it's constructed like a bag.

00:35.782 --> 00:38.826
The leather was Italian, so we have the edge painting as well.

00:38.958 --> 00:42.341
We have a larger Swoosh on ours because we wanted to have the Oblique very visible.

00:45.793 --> 00:49.313
But the best part of it actually is when you take a sock liner out,...

00:49.461 --> 00:53.149
...the Strobel line has the Dior pattern in it as well,...

00:53.272 --> 00:56.111
...so every detail has been truly obsessed.

00:59.200 --> 01:03.828
So, from the get-go, we knew that it can't just stop with the AJ1.

01:04.038 --> 01:05.691
It had to be a full collection,...

01:05.778 --> 01:08.979
...so we created an entire outfit from head to toe.

01:09.178 --> 01:13.100
We went to the archives, both for Dior and Jordan,...

01:13.235 --> 01:15.477
...basically picking the best silhouettes,...

01:15.638 --> 01:18.983
...and the ones that we are each best known for.

01:19.134 --> 01:23.145
The inspiration behind it goes right back to Michael Jordan...

01:23.245 --> 01:25.747
...and what he was wearing on and off the court.

01:25.882 --> 01:32.953
Jordan always had that sophistication as well as that street edge than any other player.
