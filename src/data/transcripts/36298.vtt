00:00.050 --> 00:04.745
We are willing to do the hard things to overcome the many challenges.

00:05.259 --> 00:07.714
This is what brings out the best in us.

00:07.838 --> 00:09.567
We are go for a mission to the moon.

00:09.843 --> 00:13.815
Our path has led to success, and to bitter losses.

00:13.915 --> 00:17.927
We come together today to mourn the loss of seven brave Americans.

00:18.028 --> 00:25.394
Yet, even when faced with tragedy and setbacks, we persevere.

00:26.740 --> 00:27.866
We keep striving.

00:29.623 --> 00:31.183
We keep believing.

00:32.049 --> 00:35.312
From space, we see our planet as a whole.

00:35.755 --> 00:37.903
We see the challenges facing it...

00:38.194 --> 00:41.580
...and we face those challenges, together.

00:42.286 --> 00:44.431
We will not give up.

00:44.862 --> 00:46.484
We challenge convention.

00:46.879 --> 00:49.461
We refuse to accept the status quo.

00:50.073 --> 00:52.314
The time at hand is hard.

00:52.767 --> 00:54.730
But we will persevere.

00:55.145 --> 00:58.501
We can still draw hope from the moon and the stars.

00:59.557 --> 01:00.563
From space.

01:01.202 --> 01:02.638
From exploration.

01:03.599 --> 01:07.265
There is a new day beyond the challenges we face now.
