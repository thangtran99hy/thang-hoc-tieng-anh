What he's feeling has become known as Zoom fatigue.

00:03.690 --> 00:07.341
...a type of mental strain that can come from any videoconferencing.

00:08.373 --> 00:09.935
Judy Lee gets it too,..

00:10.220 --> 00:12.819
...ever since the pandemic has kept her inside,...

00:13.024 --> 00:15.751
...away from her usual in-person meetings.

00:15.865 --> 00:18.603
I do feel like every time I got off of a Zoom call,...

00:19.377 --> 00:21.085
...I had to go lie down.

00:21.409 --> 00:26.290
Back-to-back meetings can be tiring, so what makes video chats worse?

00:28.245 --> 00:30.184
When that webcam light turns on,...

00:30.420 --> 00:33.197
...experts say the pressure to perform kicks in.

00:33.466 --> 00:37.543
Plus, seeing yourself staring back at you only makes things worse.

00:37.723 --> 00:39.752
It's really hard not to be self-conscious...

00:39.832 --> 00:42.030
...and keep looking back up that corner of the screen...

00:42.127 --> 00:43.387
...where you're seeing yourself.

00:43.817 --> 00:45.465
The other thing is we're not used to...

00:45.553 --> 00:48.678
...staring at people intently with eye contact.

00:48.871 --> 00:53.009
That's why it can be so uncomfortable having so many colleagues...

00:53.119 --> 00:55.823
...all staring back at you all at the same time,...

00:55.961 --> 00:57.975
...each in their own little box...

00:58.431 --> 01:00.851
in what some call Hollywood Squares mode.
