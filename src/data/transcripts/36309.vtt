00:02.036 --> 00:04.413
The Holocene has ended.

00:05.355 --> 00:08.931
What we do now, and in the next few years,...

00:09.615 --> 00:14.488
...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.

00:17.246 --> 00:22.891
The only conditions modern humans have ever known, so far, are changing...

00:23.359 --> 00:24.776
...and changing fast.

00:26.441 --> 00:28.905
Nothing stays the same on this planet.

00:29.141 --> 00:30.699
Everything changes.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.800
The Earth is going into one of these jumps...

00:33.907 --> 00:36.611
...and you don't know what is going to be on the other side of those jumps.

00:37.639 --> 00:39.070
The Earth is always jumping.

00:46.091 --> 00:47.761
Things move on this planet!

00:48.644 --> 00:49.786
Things are not still!

00:50.609 --> 00:52.261
Everything is turning.
