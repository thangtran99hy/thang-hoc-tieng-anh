I feel like we could fix poverty or hunger through business...

00:07.165 --> 00:09.863
...and the collaboration of business with science and politics.

00:13.849 --> 00:17.448
I'm an international student from India, but I've grown up in the Middle East.

00:17.831 --> 00:20.722
Growing up, I saw how my father gave his everything to his company...

00:21.023 --> 00:25.684
...but when the 2008 recession happened, they threw him out before even thinking twice.

00:26.236 --> 00:28.468
I realized that businesses need to be more ethical.

00:28.741 --> 00:32.282
That's when I knew I wanted to get into business to make a better change, a better impact.

00:33.302 --> 00:37.615
Oxford Brookes is one of the very few universities that offers a January admission.

00:38.060 --> 00:40.839
I needed some time to think about what I want to study...

00:41.389 --> 00:46.169
...and Brookes gave me the freedom to take my time and to apply in January.

00:48.130 --> 00:51.610
Studying Business and Management at Oxford Brookes has been a great experience...

00:51.701 --> 00:53.929
...because the lecturers are really approachable.

00:54.029 --> 00:57.725
So, if I have any doubts or any ideas, I can always reach out to them.

00:59.594 --> 01:03.290
I'm part of the Business Society and the Indian Brookes Society.

01:03.726 --> 01:06.393
The Oxford Brookes Business Society holds insightful events...

01:06.497 --> 01:08.829
...such as classes for stock exchanges...

01:09.283 --> 01:12.639
...and then we also have photo shoots for your CVs and your LinkedIn profiles.

01:14.509 --> 01:16.806
University is supposed to be all about opportunities...

01:16.915 --> 01:20.003
...and I feel that Brookes has gone above and beyond to provide that to students.

01:20.112 --> 01:24.024
So, I can just show up to uni and one day there'll be a fair about jobs...

01:24.115 --> 01:26.169
...and the next day there'll be a fair about societies.

01:26.407 --> 01:27.787
There's just always something to do.
