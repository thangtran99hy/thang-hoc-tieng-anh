Technology.

00:02.481 --> 00:07.112
It's advancing faster and taking less time to be widely adopted than ever before.

00:09.203 --> 00:10.056
Launch A.I.

00:10.633 --> 00:13.215
A.I. is basically an emulation of us.

00:13.417 --> 00:15.263
You're one very special person to me.

00:15.535 --> 00:17.339
Autonomous driving started.

00:17.454 --> 00:20.524
A.I. can give us that answer that we've been seeking all along.

00:20.643 --> 00:21.237
Are we alone?

00:21.548 --> 00:23.799
Each time we create a more powerful technology,...

00:23.941 --> 00:26.284
...we create a bigger lever for changing the world.

00:27.208 --> 00:31.209
Artificial intelligence can help us to feed the world population.

00:31.349 --> 00:34.802
A.I. is teaching the machine and the machine becoming smart,...

00:34.943 --> 00:39.530
...all out of the realm of sci-fi and magic and now just science.

00:39.857 --> 00:40.077
Ready?

00:45.139 --> 00:46.295
We're at the dawn of a new age.

00:47.699 --> 00:48.571
The Age of A.I.
