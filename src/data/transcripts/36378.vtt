I'm Emily Batty, a Canadian Olympic mountain bike racer.

00:03.074 --> 00:06.271
One of my goals since I was a little girl was to own a Porsche.

00:11.372 --> 00:15.499
For as long as I can remember, my dreams have been to be a world champion.

00:15.694 --> 00:18.646
Having a racing career has given me the platform...

00:18.807 --> 00:20.753
...to hopefully inspire the next generation.

00:20.801 --> 00:22.373
That really, really speaks to me.

00:22.591 --> 00:24.567
When I was little and one of the elite women...

00:25.007 --> 00:26.765
...came and spoke to me individually...

00:26.927 --> 00:30.020
...and that has resonated with me my whole career...

00:30.075 --> 00:33.745
...and I know the importance that it has on young girls...

00:33.819 --> 00:35.225
...looking up for role models.

00:35.384 --> 00:40.002
To be part of the Porsche family and community is so exciting for me.

00:40.225 --> 00:44.725
You know, their attention to detail and their passion behind performance is...

00:45.002 --> 00:48.547
...what motivates me in my career, and just the merge of the two...

00:49.197 --> 00:50.755
...is just such a natural fit for me.

00:51.083 --> 00:55.559
Equipment has a crucial part in your role for success.

00:55.873 --> 00:58.422
Your equipment is an extension of you.

00:58.635 --> 01:00.527
So, engineering truly is everything.

01:00.688 --> 01:03.784
A lot like my bike when I'm driving my Porsche, I look for...

01:03.835 --> 01:08.183
...those similar handling feelings and the corner capability...

01:08.213 --> 01:11.539
...and the braking and the throttle; it's such a divine experience.
