00:00.620 --> 00:03.953
What was the turning point for you coming back and winning?

00:04.481 --> 00:09.278
I mean, for me, I just thought it would be very embarrassing to lose this in under an hour...

00:09.401 --> 00:11.361
...so I just have to try as hard as I can...

00:11.433 --> 00:13.987
...and stop having a really bad attitude.

00:14.903 --> 00:21.767
You said from the beginning you had seven matches, seven masks, seven names.

00:22.438 --> 00:25.049
What was the message you wanted to send, Naomi?

00:25.648 --> 00:28.121
Well, what was the message that you got...

00:28.601 --> 00:33.730
...was more the question. I feel like the point is to make people start talking.

00:34.298 --> 00:38.419
What were you most gratified about the awareness that you raised?

00:39.602 --> 00:41.889
I mean, for me, I've been inside of the bubble...

00:42.032 --> 00:45.009
...so I'm not really sure what's really going on in the outside world.

00:45.104 --> 00:47.457
All I can tell is what's going on on social media...

00:47.584 --> 00:50.627
..and for me, I feel like, you know, the more retweets it gets...

00:51.530 --> 00:54.287
...or that's so lame but, you know, the more people talk about it.

00:54.816 --> 00:57.887
What are you most proud of about your time here in New York?

00:58.319 --> 01:02.558
Me, I think i fought for every match starting with the Cincinnati Tournament...

01:02.639 --> 01:03.835
...leading up to here, so.

01:05.035 --> 01:12.118
Congratulations, the champion of the 2020 US Open, Naomi Osaka.

01:12.261 --> 01:14.892
Please, Naomi, lift up your trophy.
