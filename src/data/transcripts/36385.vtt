00:06.073 --> 00:09.479
Yeah, I feel definitely there are a lot of hard times....

00:10.573 --> 00:14.458
...especially being in the bubble, you sort of overthink a lot of things.

00:14.555 --> 00:18.649
But I think I just got through it because during quarantine,...

00:18.737 --> 00:23.589
...I wanted to, you know, set myself up to possibly win this tournament.

00:23.989 --> 00:27.565
I felt I just worked so hard I wanted to give myself an opportunity...

00:27.671 --> 00:31.755
...and I wanted more people to see more names.

00:37.659 --> 00:42.745
Yeah, I mean, I was thinking about all the times I've watched the great players...

00:42.895 --> 00:46.281
...sort of collapse onto the ground and looked up in the sky...

00:46.363 --> 00:50.727
...and I've always  wanted to see what they saw and for me, you know,...

00:50.952 --> 00:55.971
...it was really an incredible moment and you know, I'm really glad I did it.

01:02.943 --> 01:06.422
Yeah, I did think about wearing a mask during the trophy ceremony.

01:06.496 --> 01:11.884
But they said not to wear a mask so I just did what they told me to do.

01:17.239 --> 01:23.163
Yeah, I guess I'll celebrate this win just by, I guess, by processing it more.

01:23.903 --> 01:27.010
I think the last few times I wasn't able to process it.

01:28.366 --> 01:33.545
And I'm just surrounded by my team, people that I like, love.

01:35.036 --> 01:39.424
Yeah, I feel like the more, hopefully, the more times I win grand slams,...

01:39.503 --> 01:42.851
...I'll be able to, you know, celebrate better.
