00:05.148 --> 00:08.111
Yeah, I definitely say it's been an important  few months.

00:09.058 --> 00:12.671
For me, my life was always "go go" tennis wise...

00:12.759 --> 00:17.325
...especially after, you know, the previous US Open that I won.

00:18.569 --> 00:22.291
It definitely accelerated things and I've never had the chance to slow down...

00:22.404 --> 00:28.047
...so the quarantine definitely gave me a chance to think a lot about things,...

00:28.493 --> 00:31.903
...what I want to accomplish, what I want people to remember me by.

00:32.977 --> 00:34.977
And, for me I came in to this tournament,...

00:35.251 --> 00:37.175
...or these two tournaments, with that mindset.

00:37.288 --> 00:39.459
I think it definitely helped me out.

00:45.793 --> 00:48.493
Yeah, I think I definitely did that.

00:48.593 --> 00:52.765
I feel a very good and recent example is the second set,...

00:53.031 --> 00:56.539
...or the first set and the second set of the match that I played today.

00:57.453 --> 01:01.259
I think I could've easily faded away but I really wanted to fight...

01:01.390 --> 01:06.468
...and just compete and, I don't know, honestly...

01:07.634 --> 01:09.701
...there wasn't really another thought in my mind.

01:09.801 --> 01:11.404
I wasn't really thinking about winning,...

01:11.477 --> 01:15.820
...I was thinking about competing and somehow I ended up with the trophy.

01:15.923 --> 01:21.162
But, yeah I feel like I've definitely tried to mature.

01:21.801 --> 01:24.819
I wasn't really sure the process that I was going to have to take...

01:24.957 --> 01:28.563
...but I feel like you know, the lessons that I learned with life...

01:28.675 --> 01:30.871
...definitely develop me as a person more.

01:37.549 --> 01:40.144
Yeah, I mean definitely I feel like for me,...

01:40.269 --> 01:44.103
...I learn more through experiences so I want to, you know,...

01:44.199 --> 01:47.262
...everyone sort of think things they know...

01:47.713 --> 01:50.614
...or I actually don't want to know how are they feeling...

01:50.715 --> 01:52.413
...or how they felt during the process...

01:52.544 --> 01:56.083
...but for me, I feel like sharing stories...

01:56.174 --> 01:59.856
...and hearing, you know, people's experiences is very valuable.
