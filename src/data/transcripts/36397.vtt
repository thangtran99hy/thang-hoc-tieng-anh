Let's talk about the strategy behind a killer introduction email.

00:04.061 --> 00:05.435
Let's start with tip number one.

00:05.945 --> 00:10.043
Tip number one: quickly introduce your name, location and title.

00:10.259 --> 00:14.615
You don't need the backstory of why you picked up your first styling floral kit...

00:14.719 --> 00:16.019
...or why you picked up your first camera.

00:16.285 --> 00:18.584
Just tell me your name, where you're from, and your title.

00:18.846 --> 00:21.084
In my case, I would say I'm Jasmine Star.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.261
I'm a photographer from Newport Beach, California.

00:23.831 --> 00:25.459
Get into it right quickly.

00:25.703 --> 00:30.096
Number two: identify key details you like about their business.

00:30.247 --> 00:32.833
So, you start it for the introduction and then you talk about them.

00:33.147 --> 00:34.043
Why do you talk about them?

00:34.138 --> 00:37.195
Well, it indicates that you are following what their business is doing.

00:37.290 --> 00:38.752
And it could be by way of newsletters.

00:38.940 --> 00:41.937
It could be by way of their YouTube channel or by way of social media.

00:42.243 --> 00:45.196
The idea is secondly, identify more things about them...

00:45.295 --> 00:47.475
...because you build trust right off the bat.
