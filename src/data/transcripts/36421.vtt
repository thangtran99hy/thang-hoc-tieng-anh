Hi.

00:01.073 --> 00:01.349
Hi there!

00:01.445 --> 00:02.047
How can I help you?

00:02.475 --> 00:05.435
This basic response simply confirms an agent is available...

00:05.653 --> 00:08.552
...and lets the customer know it's okay to ask their question.

00:08.823 --> 00:11.709
At times, a canned response will not be appropriate...

00:11.919 --> 00:15.039
...especially when online chat users skip the formalities...

00:15.144 --> 00:16.367
...and get straight to the point.

00:16.938 --> 00:18.591
I need to find out your pricing.

00:18.999 --> 00:19.404
Hey there.

00:19.482 --> 00:20.559
Great to hear from you today.

00:20.793 --> 00:22.606
This canned response isn't appropriate.

00:22.889 --> 00:24.482
It's clearly an automated response...

00:24.583 --> 00:27.115
...that doesn't address the customer's specific question,...

00:27.381 --> 00:28.905
...but instead waste their time.

00:29.498 --> 00:31.200
A better response in this situation...

00:31.458 --> 00:33.522
...would be to skip the canned greeting altogether...

00:33.691 --> 00:35.145
...and respond with something like:

00:35.763 --> 00:38.255
Hi, yes I can certainly assist with pricing.

00:38.711 --> 00:40.369
Which product are you looking at?
