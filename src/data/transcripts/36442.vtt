Dear Spike, Dear Oprah, Dear Stevie...

00:04.379 --> 00:08.046
Your music has guided me through the most difficult moments of my life.

00:08.638 --> 00:12.557
I get letters from so many people that share their stories.

00:12.691 --> 00:16.159
I keep fighting voices in my mind...

00:16.268 --> 00:19.973
...that say I'm not enough.

00:21.165 --> 00:25.035
Whoa! Are all of these letters for me?

00:25.213 --> 00:27.480
Remind me once again...

00:27.589 --> 00:30.712
Every time you make something, you're throwing rocks in a pond.

00:30.869 --> 00:33.914
You have no idea of the ripples that are going to come back to you...

00:34.205 --> 00:35.113
...every time you make something.

00:35.558 --> 00:37.501
All of us must stand up together.

00:37.808 --> 00:43.617
If one person tells their story, that allows other people to say,...

00:43.811 --> 00:45.996
"You know what, that happened to me, that's me there."

00:46.245 --> 00:49.921
It's as though I'm watching my life and the lives of my students on screen.

00:53.345 --> 00:58.151
I could speak to people about their problems because I grew up struggling.

00:59.705 --> 01:01.325
You're fat, you're too brown.

01:01.497 --> 01:04.821
Ballet was the first time I felt like, "Wow, I'm beautiful."

01:06.507 --> 01:09.480
With you as an example, I've become the first black woman...

01:09.535 --> 01:11.937
...to get a PhD in aerospace engineering.

01:12.029 --> 01:14.936
I knew that I could defy the odds, too.

01:15.289 --> 01:16.457
Oh my gosh.

01:16.501 --> 01:18.263
That can transform everything.

01:18.530 --> 01:21.227
You say I'm loved...

01:21.441 --> 01:25.877
Big Bird, you showed me how to accept people for who they truly are, starting with myself.

01:27.219 --> 01:30.177
Your music helped me create the Equal Justice Initiative.

01:30.289 --> 01:33.751
That inspires me to want to write more songs and play them better.

01:33.834 --> 01:36.593
You lit a fire inside of us, and we're lighting that same fireâ€¦

01:36.691 --> 01:38.563
...in other kids around the world.

01:38.688 --> 01:43.487
If every one of us focused on something that you want to change, we can change the world.

01:43.547 --> 01:47.169
Your legacy is every life you've touched.
