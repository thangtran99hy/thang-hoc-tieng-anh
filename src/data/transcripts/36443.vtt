00:00.000 --> 00:01.418
We used to be a family of two.

00:02.573 --> 00:03.843
Now look at us.

00:04.462 --> 00:07.170
Here we are, yeah, it is pretty big out there.

00:07.396 --> 00:09.855
And I'm sure your head must be filled with questions.

00:11.955 --> 00:13.105
Now then, let's see...

00:15.249 --> 00:16.979
Welcome to planet Earth.

00:18.138 --> 00:22.583
There is much to see and do here, so let's get started with a quick tour.

00:25.041 --> 00:25.839
Come on!

00:27.247 --> 00:29.733
Life on Earth is a wonderful thing.

00:29.981 --> 00:34.741
Wow, it looks big, but there are lots of us on here.

00:35.263 --> 00:40.463
We may all look different, but don't be fooled, we are all people.

00:40.738 --> 00:41.472
Hello!

00:41.585 --> 00:43.685
And we all share the Earth.

00:46.127 --> 00:51.161
The world is so huge that no matter how much I learn, it'll never be enough!

00:52.186 --> 00:54.415
It sounds like you feel... lost.

00:54.579 --> 00:57.513
If you're feeling lost, just start with what you know.

01:00.583 --> 01:01.902
Hello, birds!

01:03.596 --> 01:04.876
Look at that!
