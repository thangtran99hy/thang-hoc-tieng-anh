It's important that all online chat customers...

00:02.885 --> 00:05.055
...receive a friendly and positive greeting.

00:05.509 --> 00:08.517
But, it's also important they receive a response quickly.

00:08.713 --> 00:10.777
As quickly as they would if they called you.

00:11.288 --> 00:13.199
Customers initiating an online chat...

00:13.511 --> 00:16.081
...will have already experienced the delay whilst their message...

00:16.149 --> 00:17.616
...is transferred to an agent.

00:17.806 --> 00:21.572
So, it's fine for that agent to shortcut the time it takes to type a greeting...

00:21.753 --> 00:23.349
...by using a canned response.

00:23.663 --> 00:26.896
The key here is to ensure your canned responses are genuine,...

00:27.155 --> 00:29.896
...suit your company image and suit the situation.
