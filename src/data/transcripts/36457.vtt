Canned messages may also be used to shortcut typing out a standard response.

00:05.597 --> 00:07.381
This can save the agent typing time...

00:07.654 --> 00:10.499
...but also saves the agent having to check details themselves...

00:10.689 --> 00:12.357
...and reduces the risk of error.

00:13.590 --> 00:15.996
Can you tell me how much your standard packages cost?

00:16.683 --> 00:20.067
Packages range from 39 dollars a month to 59 dollars a month...

00:20.269 --> 00:23.436
...depending on a couple of variables like how many users you require...

00:23.689 --> 00:24.857
...and which features you need.

00:25.387 --> 00:26.542
How many staff do you have?

00:27.203 --> 00:31.150
Using a canned response in this scenario made the interaction quicker...

00:31.327 --> 00:33.607
...and also eliminated the chance of making an error.

00:33.826 --> 00:36.735
Remember to be selective in your use of canned responses.

00:36.915 --> 00:38.436
Don't use them automatically.

00:38.757 --> 00:41.774
Use them selectively when appropriate for the situation.
