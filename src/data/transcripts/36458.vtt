When it comes to the manufacturing and design of high-tech toilets,...

00:02.819 --> 00:05.037
...there's no country in the world that surpasses Japan,...

00:05.138 --> 00:06.986
...but now they've taken it to another level...

00:07.244 --> 00:11.990
...and they've designed and installed the world's very first see-through toilet cubicle.

00:18.247 --> 00:22.094
So, these newly installed cubicles are funded by the Nippon Foundation,...

00:22.627 --> 00:26.158

00:40.115 --> 00:41.858
...so they can see if someone is waiting inside.

00:43.501 --> 00:46.571
It's a universally held opinion that public toilets are often gross...

00:46.695 --> 00:49.671
...and rather grim places that you really only opted to use...

00:49.780 --> 00:51.026
...if you had no other choice.

00:51.456 --> 00:54.677
In a bid to change the status quo, the Nippon Foundation...
