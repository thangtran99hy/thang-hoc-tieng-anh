In this year's Annual Letter, Melinda and I take the toughest questionsâ€¦

00:07.632 --> 00:09.747
...we get asked and give our answers.

00:10.871 --> 00:14.853
One that's come up for a long time is, as we make the world healthier,...

00:15.190 --> 00:19.749
...is the population going to get so big that feeding everybody...

00:19.999 --> 00:23.805
...and maintaining the environment is going to be impossible?

00:24.641 --> 00:30.337
Here we can see a chart that looks at the total world population...

00:30.631 --> 00:35.669
...over the last several hundred years, and at first glance, this is a bit scary.

00:35.856 --> 00:40.750
We go from less than a billion in 1800, and then 3, 4, 5, 6...

00:41.135 --> 00:46.043
...and 7.4 billion where we are today, is happening even faster.

00:46.818 --> 00:50.545
So, Melinda and I wondered whether providing new medicines...

00:50.821 --> 00:55.371
...and keeping children alive, would that create more of a population problem?

00:56.079 --> 01:01.988
What we found out is that as health improves, families choose to have less children...

01:02.633 --> 01:06.526
...and this effect is very, very dramatic.

01:07.088 --> 01:11.285
We find that in every country of the world, this is repeated,...

01:11.876 --> 01:14.657
...that population growth goes down as we improve health.

01:15.303 --> 01:20.175
So, we've taken that chart that shows the global population growth...

01:20.780 --> 01:25.425
...and we've actually extended it out all the way to 2100,...

01:26.004 --> 01:29.843
...and we can see that instead of continuing, it actually flattens out.

01:30.435 --> 01:34.021
Another way to see that is through this rate of population growth,...

01:34.494 --> 01:38.653
...and you can see that in the 60s, that reached a pretty high number...

01:38.751 --> 01:43.741
...over 2% per year, and it's now come way, way down.

01:44.684 --> 01:48.075
Now, 11 billion people is still a lot, but the good news is...

01:48.345 --> 01:53.635
...that the faster we improve health, the faster family size goes down,...

01:54.314 --> 01:58.229
...and so, we can feel great about saving those lives.
