Counting, Ordering, Naming.

00:03.913 --> 00:07.895
In English, there is more than one way to use numbers.

00:09.059 --> 00:12.509
We can use them to count, like one, two, three.

00:15.067 --> 00:18.737
And we can use them when we're talking about the order of something:...

00:19.340 --> 00:21.226
...first, second, third.

00:27.199 --> 00:30.162
We also use numbers to name things.

00:30.717 --> 00:32.771
For example, the number of a house...

00:33.143 --> 00:36.025
...or the number on the back of a sports jersey.

00:45.654 --> 00:49.473
Numbers can be written as words or symbols.

00:51.618 --> 00:53.427
Look at the table on this page.

00:53.886 --> 00:56.115
Notice how the numbers for ordering:...

00:56.457 --> 00:59.059
...first, second, third, fourth, and so on...

00:59.650 --> 01:02.587
...use the last two letters of the word.

01:03.427 --> 01:06.554
For example, first: F I R S T.

01:07.161 --> 01:09.169
The -S T is used with the 1.

01:09.736 --> 01:12.112
For second, we use the N D.

01:12.632 --> 01:15.617
For third, we use the R D and so on.
