00:00.050 --> 00:03.310
I come from a lower-middle-class part of Honolulu...

00:04.214 --> 00:08.323
...and I don't want to paint a picture of total poverty,...

00:08.576 --> 00:12.185
...just overcoming horrendous conditions because that's not true.

00:12.279 --> 00:14.953
I had a very happy lower-middle-class upbringing.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.545
I'm third-generation Japanese-American.

00:18.181 --> 00:25.314
My family came over from Japan because of the lack of economic opportunity.

00:26.136 --> 00:30.466
And you could also make the case that my family came over because, at that time,...

00:32.081 --> 00:34.652
...males in Japan were conscripted.

00:34.766 --> 00:37.296
So, you were drafted to go fight in China,...

00:37.759 --> 00:41.495
...so you could make the case that I come from a family of draft dodgers.

00:41.641 --> 00:43.379
And the lesson that I learned here is that,...

00:43.783 --> 00:45.889
...you know, my family made a very big decision.

00:46.352 --> 00:51.641
They didn't just change jobs or change streets or change prefectures,...

00:51.976 --> 00:53.183
...they changed countries.

00:54.041 --> 00:57.985
And the wisdom I got from that is, you know, change a losing game.

00:58.095 --> 01:00.465
If you're in a game that you cannot win,...

01:00.972 --> 01:04.235
...the odds are stacked against you, then change it.

01:04.447 --> 01:07.892
And in their case, they left Japan and moved to Hawaii.

01:08.256 --> 01:11.209
Now, it's not like they moved to Hawaii to become investment bankers.

01:11.627 --> 01:14.201
They moved to Hawaii to pick sugarcane.

01:14.707 --> 01:19.239
So, pick sugarcane, first generation, second generation,...

01:19.669 --> 01:22.299
...real estate broker, state senator.

01:22.419 --> 01:28.561
My father, third generation, goes to Stanford, Silicon Valley, tech, the whole thing.

01:28.971 --> 01:32.965
So, I'm the third generation, but the first generation,...

01:33.120 --> 01:35.640
...the generation that moved to Hawaii is what changed the game.
