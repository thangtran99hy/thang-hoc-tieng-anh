Fortnite is a fun, new survival game from Epic Games that offers players a unique experience.

00:06.019 --> 00:10.759
Instead of simply building a base, you'll need to scavenge for supplies and complete different missions...

00:10.995 --> 00:15.235
...all while holding off the endless hordes of husks that seem to fall from the sky...

00:15.326 --> 00:17.011
...whenever something bad happens.

00:17.220 --> 00:21.757
In this video, we will address the game's basic systems and help you get the hang of everything...

00:21.834 --> 00:24.870
...as you dive into Fortnite to get started for the first time.

00:25.221 --> 00:28.139
Scavenging is one of your primary goals in Fortnite,...

00:28.445 --> 00:30.409
...and if you want to make it anywhere in the game,...

00:30.547 --> 00:33.071
...you're going to need to get used to keeping your supplies backpack...

00:33.191 --> 00:35.559
...filled with items like stone, metal and wood.

00:35.749 --> 00:40.317
These are the basic building blocks you'll use to build up structures like walls and floors,...

00:40.531 --> 00:43.432
...and you'll need to have plenty of them on you at all times.

00:43.807 --> 00:47.284
Trust us, you can easily scavenge wood from trees and other wooden things...

00:47.395 --> 00:50.221
...like logs and even some wooden structures.

00:50.398 --> 00:53.537
If you want metal, we suggest hitting up pipes or even cars.

00:53.791 --> 00:58.138
You can also find stashes of metal ore in caves on more forest space missions.

00:58.386 --> 01:00.957
So, be sure to look around for ways to go deeper in the map.

01:01.325 --> 01:03.695
You'll find more metal in city-based missions...

01:03.867 --> 01:07.216
...where you can find cars and even metal poles to break down.

01:07.386 --> 01:09.903
The best way to get stone is to look around for large rocks...

01:09.990 --> 01:11.437
...that you can hit with your pickaxe.

01:11.743 --> 01:13.286
These are often found in every map,...

01:13.515 --> 01:18.161
...but they are most abundant in maps that take place in forests or on the outskirts of the city.

01:18.483 --> 01:20.774
Schematics are your main way of getting new weapons,...

01:21.036 --> 01:24.101
...and these items can be attained by finding chests during missions...

01:24.319 --> 01:27.641
...or by bursting open llamas in the loot tab on the main menu.
