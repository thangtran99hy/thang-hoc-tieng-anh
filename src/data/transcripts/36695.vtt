Right from the start, it can be tempting to upgrade your schematics...

00:03.275 --> 00:05.367
...once you have the experience available for it,...

00:05.595 --> 00:08.583
...but you should definitely wait before you start upgrading these items.

00:08.999 --> 00:10.411
See, when you upgrade a schematic,...

00:10.629 --> 00:13.189
...not only do you make the base power of your weapons stronger,...

00:13.356 --> 00:15.955
...but you also make it cost more crafting materials.

00:16.318 --> 00:18.547
Sometimes, if you upgrade a schematic too far,...

00:18.668 --> 00:20.473
...you won't be able to actually get those schematics...

00:20.597 --> 00:22.529
...until you reach later points in the game.

00:22.772 --> 00:24.819
This makes the schematics useless to you,...

00:24.945 --> 00:26.799
...and you'll want to avoid this at all times.

00:27.264 --> 00:30.389
One of the most interesting choices that Epic Games have made for Fortnite...

00:30.487 --> 00:31.769
...is the durability feature.

00:32.003 --> 00:35.514
Basically, each weapon that you use has a specific durability,...

00:35.665 --> 00:39.707
...and once this durability runs out, the weapon breaks and another is equipped.

00:39.911 --> 00:42.775
This means you want to be constantly on the lookout for toolboxes...

00:42.859 --> 00:44.839
...and any other objects that you can search...

00:45.045 --> 00:46.697
...as you'll need to be able to build new weapons...

00:46.811 --> 00:48.493
...from your schematics when you need them.

00:48.736 --> 00:53.127
Of course, you shouldn't overstock your weapons or hoard items you find in the wild...

00:53.310 --> 00:56.159
...as you have a very limited amount of space in your inventory.

00:56.328 --> 01:00.143
You can keep an eye on your weapons durability by checking the line in the right icon.

01:00.303 --> 01:04.390
This line starts at the top and slowly wears down as you use the weapon more and more.

01:04.547 --> 01:08.481
Most weapons have a pretty good amount of durability, but lower tier heavy weapons...

01:08.563 --> 01:11.669
...like the RPG have a much smaller amount of durability.

01:11.915 --> 01:14.969
The kicker here though is that they have unlimited ammunition...

01:15.161 --> 01:17.780
...so you won't have to waste resources crafting ammo for them.

01:18.065 --> 01:20.426
Being a new player on Fortnite can be stressful...

01:20.591 --> 01:23.189
...especially if you don't know how to use the game's basic systems.

01:23.412 --> 01:25.753
If you keep all the information we've shared in mind,...

01:25.911 --> 01:28.070
...then you should be well on your way to mastering the basics...

01:28.171 --> 01:30.705
...and moving on to the more advanced parts of the game.
