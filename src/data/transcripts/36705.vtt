00:00.094 --> 00:02.473
I will tell you very simply, we won the election.

00:03.049 --> 00:04.839
Elections have consequences.

00:05.210 --> 00:07.571
We have the Senate, we have the White House...

00:07.709 --> 00:12.311
...and we have a phenomenal nominee, respected by all.

00:13.016 --> 00:17.499
The American people have a right to have a say who the Supreme Court nominee is.

00:17.605 --> 00:21.534
And that say occurs when they vote for United States senators...

00:22.029 --> 00:24.424
...and when they vote for the President of the United States.

00:25.550 --> 00:29.379
They're not gonna get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already.

00:30.681 --> 00:33.933
He panicked or he just looked at the stock market, one of the two...

00:34.098 --> 00:36.448
...because guess what, a lot of people died.

00:36.901 --> 00:39.605
And a lot more are gonna die unless he gets a lot smarter.

00:40.045 --> 00:43.879
If we would have listened to you, the country would have been left wide open,...

00:44.069 --> 00:48.311
...millions of people would have died, not 200,000 and one person is too much.

00:48.419 --> 00:49.258
It's China's fault.

00:49.374 --> 00:52.284
That should have never happened, they stopped it from going in,...

00:52.388 --> 00:53.516
...but it was China's fault.

00:53.828 --> 00:57.003
This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country.

00:57.374 --> 01:01.420
Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it.

01:01.883 --> 01:04.755
We don't need somebody to come in and say let's shut it down.

01:04.933 --> 01:07.793
We handed him our booming economy, he blew it.

01:07.972 --> 01:11.071
Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.

01:11.276 --> 01:13.030
But I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what.

01:13.431 --> 01:16.157
Somebody's got to do something about Antifa and the left...

01:16.275 --> 01:19.789
...because this is not a right-wing problem, this is a left-wing...

01:20.548 --> 01:22.539
This is a left-wing problem.

01:23.678 --> 01:27.219
Antifa is an idea not an organization, not militia.
