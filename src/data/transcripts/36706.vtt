00:00.979 --> 00:02.738
Well, let's talk about climate change.

00:03.101 --> 00:06.616
Now, people think, "Hey, aren't we getting the solar panels...

00:06.727 --> 00:09.128
... and windmills to be a lot less expensive?

00:09.867 --> 00:12.832
And isn't that helping reduce greenhouse gases"?

00:13.112 --> 00:14.741
And the answer is, absolutely.

00:15.323 --> 00:20.360
But, there's a lot more to do than just taking electricity to zero emissions.

00:20.572 --> 00:23.675
There's a variety of things that generate greenhouse gases.

00:24.011 --> 00:27.341
We have a lot of sectors of the economy, like manufacturing,...

00:27.667 --> 00:31.107
...that are emitting greenhouse gases that aren't talked about as much.

00:31.506 --> 00:32.509
Manufacturing.

00:32.731 --> 00:36.367
Everything we make, even a cute little squishy like this,...

00:36.477 --> 00:40.157
...that's emitting 21% of the greenhouse gases.

00:41.464 --> 00:45.419
The number of buildings in the world is going to double by 2060.

00:45.749 --> 00:52.910
It's like we're going to build a new New York City every month for the next 40 years.

00:53.391 --> 00:56.567
It's a gigantic amount of materials.

00:57.069 --> 01:01.289
Steel, cement, wood, all emitting greenhouse gases.

01:01.487 --> 01:04.838
We're going to have to figure out how to make all these things in a different way.

01:05.231 --> 01:08.799
And so, we're going to need a lot of change, a lot of innovation,...

01:09.268 --> 01:13.411
...to bring the emissions from all those areas down to zero.
