Minecraft.

00:03.485 --> 00:06.270
You might not have played it, but you've most certainly heard of it.

00:06.845 --> 00:10.001
Released to the public back in 2009 in embryonic form,...

00:10.381 --> 00:12.507
...the game has been in development ever since,...

00:12.649 --> 00:15.198
...with players regularly receiving free software updates...

00:15.379 --> 00:18.143
...that continue to add exciting new features and functionality.

00:18.724 --> 00:19.611
But what is it?

00:20.312 --> 00:22.667
Well, it's whatever you want it to be.

00:23.444 --> 00:26.340
After being dropped into a randomly generated 3D world,...

00:26.478 --> 00:29.663
...in which everything is created from a range of identically-sized cubes,...

00:29.978 --> 00:31.974
...it's up to you what you choose to do.

00:32.324 --> 00:34.337
A huge part of the game's appeal is its breadth.

00:34.711 --> 00:36.832
If you get bored with one area of gameplay,...

00:36.951 --> 00:38.799
...there's many others to keep you amused.

00:39.293 --> 00:42.161
It would take hours, if not days, to go into all of them in detail,...

00:42.229 --> 00:45.941
...but for now, here's a quick overview of some of the main things you can get up to.

00:49.371 --> 00:52.687
One of the first things you want to focus your efforts on is setting up a base...

00:52.783 --> 00:54.479
...from which you can go on your adventures.

00:54.979 --> 00:58.317
Building a structure that protects you and your possessions from the game's many threats...

00:58.400 --> 01:02.837
...is a great way to get the hang of the basic mechanic of gathering and placing materials.

01:03.337 --> 01:06.174
Alongside this, you'll create yourself some basic tools...

01:06.259 --> 01:08.938
...such as axes, shovels and pickaxes to make the job easier,...

01:09.241 --> 01:13.011
...plus a crafting table and furnace to make the most of the resources you'll find.

01:13.419 --> 01:14.844
But where will you find them?

01:15.653 --> 01:18.585
Well, you might choose to go exploring and find a cave,...

01:18.705 --> 01:22.779
...where there'll hopefully be some rare materials to mine, such as gold, iron and diamonds.

01:23.171 --> 01:26.317
You'll need to keep alert though, as various baddies known as "mobs"...

01:26.542 --> 01:28.366
...may have other plans for you.
