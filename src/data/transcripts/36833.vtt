00:00.134 --> 00:04.570
Assuming you escaped unharmed, the materials you gathered can be applied in a number of ways,...

00:04.766 --> 00:07.330
...for example, crafting armor that offers further protection,...

00:07.616 --> 00:11.620
...developing more efficient and stronger tools or even building mine carts and rails...

00:11.699 --> 00:13.787
...to quickly transport you between locations.

00:14.702 --> 00:17.346
You might also explore above ground and find a village...

00:17.468 --> 00:20.571
...where you can trade with the inhabitants for various precious items.

00:20.959 --> 00:23.773
Go further afield, and you might notice changes in the landscape.

00:24.102 --> 00:26.635
In-game, these different areas are known as biomes:...

00:27.041 --> 00:30.561
...oceans, deserts, jungles and some altogether stranger places...

00:30.665 --> 00:32.999
...each offer unique resources and wildlife.

00:33.492 --> 00:35.296
Gather these and before you know it,...

00:35.513 --> 00:38.625
...you have a farmstead with a wealth of different crops and creatures you can use...

00:38.721 --> 00:40.156
...for essential food and supply.

00:41.036 --> 00:44.111
Back down the mine, you might find some lapis lazuli,...

00:44.254 --> 00:46.271
...which you can use to enhance your tools and armor...

00:46.379 --> 00:48.900
...on your library's enchantment table, if you built one.

00:49.308 --> 00:53.181
Maybe you'll find some redstone, which you could use to create a whole range of electrical circuits,...

00:53.272 --> 00:57.863
...powering anything from secret doorways to roller coasters that trigger firework displays.

00:58.228 --> 01:00.221
Or perhaps, you'll pour some water onto lava...

01:00.475 --> 01:03.077
...and mine the results and obsidian to create a Nether portal.

01:03.766 --> 01:08.894
Enter the Nether and you will be faced with a whole new world of even more dangerous mobs.

01:09.340 --> 01:12.067
Whilst here, you might seek out a Nether fortress,...

01:12.339 --> 01:14.878
...kill the creatures known as Blazes to collect their rods...

01:15.135 --> 01:19.666
...and you can use those for potion brewing, which would be vital in crafting eyes of Ender...

01:19.792 --> 01:21.868
...that help direct you to the world's stronghold.

01:22.175 --> 01:26.321
From there, you can repair and use its portal to teleport to the Ender Dragon,...

01:26.737 --> 01:28.187
...the game's end boss.
