Novak said you played the first two sets virtually perfect.

00:04.281 --> 00:08.855
So, do you think those are two of the best sets you've ever played at Roland-Garros?

00:09.136 --> 00:12.957
Well, of course I played at an amazing level of tennis.

00:14.176 --> 00:16.407
For two sets and a half, I played great, honestly.

00:16.526 --> 00:17.969
I can't say another thing.

00:18.539 --> 00:22.667
It's impossible to have this score against him without playing great.

00:24.271 --> 00:26.405
Yeah, I played a very good final.

00:26.501 --> 00:29.775
I played at my highest level when I needed to play at my highest level,...

00:30.102 --> 00:32.434
...so it's something that I am very proud of.

00:32.716 --> 00:41.247
The personal satisfaction is big because under the circumstances that we played this Roland-Garros,...

00:41.324 --> 00:44.900
...even if I played an amazing match this afternoon,..

00:45.061 --> 00:54.663
...the conditions are not the conditions that I will choose to play in an event like this.

00:55.496 --> 00:57.513
But, I was able to adapt well.

00:57.859 --> 01:00.612
I was able to, as I said the first day,...

01:00.692 --> 01:06.363
...to be positive in every circumstance that I was facing during the whole event.

01:07.459 --> 01:16.129
Plan to accept all the challenges in terms of, sometimes  the feeling on the ball hasn't been great...

01:16.243 --> 01:17.953
...because of the cold and everything.

01:19.505 --> 01:20.865
But, I take it in a positive way.

01:21.403 --> 01:30.012
I just tried to work every day with the right determination, looking for my goals.

01:32.609 --> 01:40.919
I think it's one of the Roland-Garros that has a better personal value for myself.
