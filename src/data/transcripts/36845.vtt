00:00.321 --> 00:01.345
Our plan is simple.

00:02.413 --> 00:07.399
We can stop the spread by staying at home and reducing contact.

00:07.542 --> 00:11.298
All across the country, stores are emptying and so are the streets,...

00:11.472 --> 00:13.787
...as New Zealand gets ready for the lockdown.

00:14.270 --> 00:19.173
Non-essential businesses in New Zealand must now close:...

00:19.455 --> 00:25.571
...all bars, restaurants, cafes, cinemas, pools, playgrounds.

00:25.780 --> 00:27.015
Were we overreacting?

00:27.149 --> 00:28.311
Some people said we were,...

00:28.604 --> 00:32.856
...and certainly when the scientists say shut the borders and lock down the country.

00:33.371 --> 00:36.593
That's quite a hard scenario to justify.

00:37.168 --> 00:40.023
A really core part of our success in this...

00:40.150 --> 00:44.142
...was the coherence and comprehensiveness of our communication campaign.

00:44.270 --> 00:47.083
I'm speaking directly to all New Zealanders today...

00:47.499 --> 00:54.288
...to give you much certainty and clarity as we can as we fight COVID-19.

00:54.451 --> 00:58.913
It was really important to have very clear and consistent messaging.

00:59.177 --> 01:01.137
And so, while the job is not done,...

01:01.749 --> 01:03.929
...there's no denying this is a milestone.

01:04.523 --> 01:08.546
So, can I finish with a very simple, "Thank you, New Zealand."
