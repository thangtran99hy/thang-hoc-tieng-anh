00:00.807 --> 00:04.225
In this new era of travel, there will be stricter hygiene standards...

00:04.529 --> 00:08.711
...with hand sanitizers, face masks and social distancing becoming the norm.

00:09.007 --> 00:12.621
The World Travel and Tourism Council says a coordinated response is key.

00:12.760 --> 00:16.797
It is crucial to use the same standard protocols across the world...

00:17.118 --> 00:19.145
...so that the traveler feels comfortable.

00:19.363 --> 00:22.775
So, we could well see standardized cleaning and testing protocols...

00:22.863 --> 00:24.059
...introduced around the world.

00:24.293 --> 00:26.865
In airports, we'll likely see health screening processes...

00:26.954 --> 00:29.721
...like temperature checks and COVID-19 tests.

00:30.432 --> 00:32.982
Your in-flight experience may look a little different too,...

00:33.064 --> 00:36.555
...with an increasing number of airlines telling passengers to wear face masks.

00:37.100 --> 00:40.655
EasyJet is said to be looking into social distancing measures...

00:40.739 --> 00:44.769
...such as leaving middle seats empty, and if air capacity is down...

00:44.857 --> 00:47.409
...as a result, then the cost of travel could well go up.

00:47.556 --> 00:51.265
At sea, cruises are talking about introducing one-way systems on board,...

00:51.803 --> 00:55.143
...and it's unlikely you'll be able to find buffets in the post-COVID world.

00:55.728 --> 00:58.550
They could become a thing of the past in hotels, too.
