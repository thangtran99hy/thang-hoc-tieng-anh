Any gathering in person is going to carry some level of risk,...

00:03.455 --> 00:06.779
...but I do think there are ways to do it much more safely.

00:11.839 --> 00:14.495
If you're gathering with people who you really know well,...

00:14.619 --> 00:17.510
...you know their circle of people that they're staying with,...

00:17.878 --> 00:21.377
...then you can be more certain of the risk that you're facing...

00:21.469 --> 00:22.609
...when you get together with them.

00:22.704 --> 00:23.988
If you don't know people well,...

00:24.157 --> 00:27.300
...they may be meeting up with lots of other people who you don't know,...

00:27.707 --> 00:31.183
...and so it's not just your very small circle that you have to consider,...

00:31.282 --> 00:34.459
...but also the many other people that are in their circle.

00:35.007 --> 00:38.431
And we're most concerned about spreading the virus to people...

00:38.525 --> 00:42.363
...who are more vulnerable, who are older or have underlying health conditions.

00:43.427 --> 00:47.949
We know that gathering indoors is much less safe than gathering outdoors,...

00:48.033 --> 00:50.557
...so at any point, if you are going to have a gathering,...

00:50.642 --> 00:54.151
...if you can take it outside, that will always be safer.

00:54.573 --> 00:55.953
Even if you are outside, though,...

00:56.041 --> 00:58.456
...you should still try to maintain that physical distance...

00:58.537 --> 01:01.462
...of greater than six feet as much as possible.

01:01.897 --> 01:03.716
And if you're not eating or drinking,...

01:03.805 --> 01:08.647
...then wearing a face covering, I think, really does offer you some good protection.

01:09.326 --> 01:11.879
We're all under a tremendous amount of stress...

01:11.968 --> 01:14.232
...and it's made even harder...

01:14.320 --> 01:18.981
...without the support networks that we all count on day to day in our family and friends.

01:19.069 --> 01:21.979
So, the more we can practice these public health measures...

01:22.057 --> 01:25.074
...and keep physically distant even when we're together,...

01:25.345 --> 01:28.515
...we'll reduce the risk; we'll break chains of transmission,...

01:28.646 --> 01:32.683
...and you'll also contribute to getting this pandemic under better control.
