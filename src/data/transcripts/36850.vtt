00:00.652 --> 00:03.003
To get by car here is not possible.

00:03.172 --> 00:04.379
You really have to hike.

00:04.775 --> 00:09.431
This restaurant has been perched in the Swiss Alps for 173 years,...

00:09.699 --> 00:12.872
...and the trek has always attracted hungry hikers.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.033
But it's steep,...

00:14.479 --> 00:16.520
...nearly 5,000 feet up.

00:17.310 --> 00:19.589
Hello, and welcome to the Aescher.

00:27.805 --> 00:30.803
I'm Melanie Gmunder and I'm the manager of the restaurant.

00:31.115 --> 00:33.072
Our food is very traditional.

00:33.196 --> 00:37.590
We got like sausage, cheese, salad or nut croissant.

00:37.936 --> 00:40.559
But before you make any orders, here's how to get there.

00:44.535 --> 00:48.727
First, get to the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden and head to Wasserauen.

00:49.980 --> 00:51.157
Then cable car it.

00:51.577 --> 00:55.331
You'll go up a distance of over 2,000 feet to the Ebenalp mountain.

00:55.687 --> 00:59.383
Once you get there, have your hiking boots ready for 15 minutes' steep hike,...

00:59.863 --> 01:01.823
...go through a 40,000-year-old cave,...

01:01.907 --> 01:05.091
...pass the chapel and you're there,...

01:05.701 --> 01:09.057
...or you can take a two-hour hike through other paths.
