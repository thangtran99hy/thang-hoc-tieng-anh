00:01.875 --> 00:06.291
A Japanese company can help you soak in the sights of Florence and Rome...

00:06.581 --> 00:08.455
...without ever leaving your city.

00:09.717 --> 00:15.005
A Tokyo entertainment company, First Airlines, is offering virtual travel experiences...

00:15.353 --> 00:18.840
...to customers grounded due to the coronavirus pandemic,...

00:19.291 --> 00:25.043
...and the experience you'll receive is just like the one you would receive on an actual flight.

00:25.918 --> 00:31.852
Customers, I mean passengers, sit in first class seats in a mock airplane cabin.

00:33.334 --> 00:37.631
For starters, they're given a full-fledged pre-flight safety demonstration...

00:37.925 --> 00:40.185
...with a life vest and oxygen mask.

00:41.443 --> 00:45.592
Monitors in the front of the cabin show views of the aircraft taking off.

00:49.018 --> 00:53.651
They are served in-flight meals and drinks just like they would on a real flight,...

00:55.328 --> 00:59.124
...all while enjoying views of passing clouds and scenery...

00:59.366 --> 01:01.804
...that are projected onto the sides of the cabin.

01:02.577 --> 01:07.693
For a more immersive experience, passengers can even opt to wear virtual reality goggles...

01:07.995 --> 01:10.725
...and get an actual sense of seeing things.

01:11.387 --> 01:16.609
They can tour popular destinations like Paris, New York, Rome and Hawaii,...

01:16.944 --> 01:19.193
...all while being seated in the cabin.

01:19.962 --> 01:23.502
But if you can't wait till then to fly to your favorite destination,...

01:23.843 --> 01:25.649
...you now know where to go.
