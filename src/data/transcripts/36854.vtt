BTS' latest album Map of Soul: 7 is a global hit.

00:04.441 --> 00:09.035
Even though tours and shows were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:09.671 --> 00:13.986
Also causing a buzz is BTS creator Big Hit Entertainment...

00:14.273 --> 00:17.784
...after he filed for an IPO on the local stock market.

00:18.305 --> 00:20.669
With a 43 percent stake in the company,...

00:20.930 --> 00:26.298
...the IPO will make Big Hit founder and CEO Bang Si-hyuk an instant billionaire.

00:26.751 --> 00:33.141
BTS' seven members aged between 24 and 28 are set to become multimillionaires too.

00:33.504 --> 00:40.049
With the CEO awarding each of them 68,385 shares ahead of the IPO.

00:40.527 --> 00:44.007
Back in 2017, Big Hit had thought about an IPO.

00:44.384 --> 00:48.575
But, CEO Bang at the time said the company needed to become bigger.

00:48.917 --> 00:50.136
And that's what it did.
