The COVID-19 pandemic is hitting the global entertainment industry hard.

00:04.285 --> 00:07.331
But Big Hit's financial performance continues to shine.

00:08.037 --> 00:12.007
In the first half of this year, it reported 49.7 billion won,...

00:12.296 --> 00:15.105
...about 43 million US dollars in profits...

00:15.301 --> 00:18.063
...as its online concerts and merchandise sales...

00:18.293 --> 00:22.722
...more than offset event cancellations during the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:23.572 --> 00:28.663
And last year alone, the company posted 587 billion won in revenue.

00:28.943 --> 00:33.597
About 500 million US dollars, double of that from the year earlier.

00:34.479 --> 00:38.159
The hype around K-pop and BTS' global fame in particular...

00:38.325 --> 00:41.247
...has benefited South Korea's entertainment industry.

00:41.634 --> 00:47.936
Now, Big Hit is hoping the K-pop stardust will also help it win over the capital markets.
