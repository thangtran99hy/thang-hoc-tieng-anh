Say hello to the Motorola Razr,...

00:07.132 --> 00:10.240
...a modern flip phone that fits seamlessly into your life.

00:11.145 --> 00:14.041
We completely rethought the mechanical and industrial design...

00:14.445 --> 00:16.345
...to transform user experience.

00:17.006 --> 00:20.383
Here are some of the numbers behind the new Razr's impeccable craftsmanship.

00:22.725 --> 00:26.709
Let's start with the zero-gap hinge, which allows Razr to close so tightly,...

00:26.992 --> 00:28.776
...you can't even slide a piece of paper through it.

00:29.682 --> 00:31.736
We custom-built a folding mechanism...

00:31.888 --> 00:34.779
...that could protect the display while also allowing it to flex.

00:37.079 --> 00:40.425
If you flip the Razr open 100 times a day every day,...

00:40.859 --> 00:42.688
...it would take more than five years...

00:42.827 --> 00:45.825
...to reach the baseline of our rigorous nonstop flip test.

00:47.358 --> 00:49.599
That's 200,000 flips.

00:52.370 --> 00:56.322
We built Razr with two high resolution touchscreens that work perfectly together.

00:57.965 --> 01:02.497
When closed, the external display features a robust and unique user interface,...

01:02.759 --> 01:04.063
...so it's easy to stay connected.

01:04.663 --> 01:05.868
And when you open Razr,...

01:06.014 --> 01:09.165
...whatever you're doing seamlessly transitions to the larger display...

01:09.422 --> 01:11.291
...that has all the capabilities of a smartphone.

01:12.562 --> 01:18.797
At just 85 cubic centimeters, Razr is as compact as a deck of playing cards,...

01:19.940 --> 01:22.991
...yet it features four antennas dedicated to 5G,...

01:23.712 --> 01:26.077
...a huge 48-megapixel camera sensor,...

01:26.405 --> 01:29.081
...a battery that lasts all day, and more.

01:30.572 --> 01:33.517
Packing so much capability into such a compact space...

01:33.696 --> 01:36.411
...is the result of years innovating with foldable technology.

01:37.547 --> 01:40.222
We filed over 100 patents for the Razr,...

01:40.641 --> 01:41.903
...from the dynamic hinge system,...

01:42.053 --> 01:45.316
...advanced mechanical designs to wireless network technologies,..

01:45.571 --> 01:48.229
...and even the new software for the dual screen experience.

01:49.178 --> 01:51.257
With its breakthrough engineering and design,...

01:51.573 --> 01:54.681
...the Razr delivers a totally new and unique experience,...

01:55.079 --> 01:58.034
...completely changing the way we use smartphones.
