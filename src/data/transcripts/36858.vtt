At the tip of Africa, where it was unthinkable to deliver products...

00:07.838 --> 00:11.141
...that's at the level of Paris and Tokyo and New York,...

00:11.501 --> 00:16.087
...we're now in a position where we're actually delivering at training local people...

00:16.246 --> 00:18.231
...at levels that you expect in Paris.

00:18.513 --> 00:21.093
And a couple of weeks ago,...

00:21.295 --> 00:27.727
...we were recognized as one of the four best croissant producers in the world,...

00:27.848 --> 00:29.903
...and by default, bakery.

00:36.146 --> 00:39.923
I had a lot of croissants in different places.

00:40.012 --> 00:43.384
I must say, this croissant is the perfect butter croissant...

00:43.462 --> 00:46.508
...because it is quite important if you bite into the croissant,...

00:46.717 --> 00:51.985
...it needs to make the sound and it needs to have this buttery...

00:52.191 --> 00:57.516
...and yeah, obviously, Paris kind of style, flavor.

00:57.615 --> 01:03.603
I can't even explain it, but it is like the croissant you would expect in Paris.
