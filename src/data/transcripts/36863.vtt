A volunteer in the trial of the COVID-19 vaccine...

00:03.908 --> 00:06.789
...being developed by Astra Zeneca and Oxford University...

00:07.148 --> 00:08.386
...has died in Brazil.

00:08.991 --> 00:10.928
Brazil's health authority said on Wednesday...

00:11.201 --> 00:13.143
...that although the volunteer had died,...

00:13.445 --> 00:15.199
...the trial would continue.

00:15.652 --> 00:19.172
So far, 8,000 people had been given the first dose of the vaccine...

00:19.377 --> 00:21.005
...in six cities in Brazil,...

00:21.372 --> 00:24.876
...which is grappling with one of the world's worst outbreaks of the disease.

00:25.955 --> 00:28.121
A source familiar with the matter told Reuters...

00:28.471 --> 00:32.253
...the volunteer who died was likely to have been part of a control group...

00:32.595 --> 00:35.145
...that did not receive the COVID-19 vaccine,...

00:35.631 --> 00:39.133
...suggesting that the volunteer was instead given a meningitis jab.
