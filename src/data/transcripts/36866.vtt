00:05.881 --> 00:09.027
The airplane is so aligned with your desire,...

00:09.429 --> 00:13.305
...so if I want to go up a bit, I ask it to go up a bit and it goes up a bit.

00:13.450 --> 00:15.339
I have never experienced such precision.

00:15.770 --> 00:17.411
And you know, pilots love precision...

00:17.585 --> 00:21.653
...so it's like getting in a formula one racing car, the drive of your life...

00:22.206 --> 00:25.675
...and it goes fast, it goes high, and it goes slow, and it goes low...

00:25.776 --> 00:28.265
...it does everything you want to do and it does it supremely well.

00:28.959 --> 00:32.194
So, my first flight was in November of 2010...

00:32.563 --> 00:35.254
...and I remember my very first impression of the airplane...

00:35.355 --> 00:38.002
...was just how like the modeling and the simulation it was.

00:38.293 --> 00:40.129
The airplane flies so much like the simulator...

00:40.220 --> 00:42.566
...that I felt like I knew it immediately I jumped into the air.
