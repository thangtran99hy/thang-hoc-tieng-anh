00:00.992 --> 00:03.844
It was a stage fit for the coronation of an emperor...

00:04.063 --> 00:07.803
...and for Samsung, that was in effect what Lee Kun-hee would become.

00:08.667 --> 00:12.712
On his father's death in 1987, Lee took the helm of a business...

00:12.868 --> 00:17.957
...that he would turn into South Korea's dominant family conglomerate or chaebol.

00:18.636 --> 00:21.821
He focused on increasing the ambition of the electronics arm,...

00:22.099 --> 00:27.007
...famously urging his staff to "change everything except your wives and children."

00:27.691 --> 00:33.228
The company was able to take this vision and able to dole it out into, you could say,....

00:33.317 --> 00:36.891
...ideological tracks that they would hand out to employees...

00:36.981 --> 00:38.175
...and that employees would study.

00:38.348 --> 00:41.889
They would read his words like they were literally a page out of the Bible.

00:42.562 --> 00:46.133
And there was an almost religious fervor to the public destruction...

00:46.243 --> 00:49.581
...he ordered of defective phones in 1995.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.819
The call to innovation and higher valued products...

00:53.045 --> 00:56.515
...transforms Samsung into the global giant it is today.

00:57.383 --> 01:00.847
In South Korea, the sprawling network of Samsung businesses...

01:01.131 --> 01:04.239
...covers everything from ship building to life insurance,...

01:04.503 --> 01:06.511
...construction to credit cards.

01:06.778 --> 01:11.406
The group's revenues are equivalent to 20% of South Korea's GDP.

01:11.942 --> 01:14.777
In 2014, he suffered a major heart attack.

01:15.032 --> 01:18.080
He spent the rest of his life in a Samsung hospital.

01:19.122 --> 01:24.863
The empire now rests on the shoulders of Lee's son, Jae-yong, also known as Jay Y. Lee.
