00:30.595 --> 00:34.750
Japan is expected to start development of the F-3 in 2021.

00:35.250 --> 00:38.543
Currently, Japan needs to protect themselves from China.

00:39.290 --> 00:43.698
Japan announced last month, that it will move manufacturing out of China.

00:44.176 --> 00:48.708
Furthermore, Japan expects to have the F-3 fully operational in this decade.

00:49.433 --> 00:53.591
Japanese experts are putting forward advanced technologies in the future jet.

00:56.549 --> 01:00.101
It is highly likely the new jet will include a combat laser,...

01:00.525 --> 01:02.685
...or possibly an electromagnetic weapon.

01:04.567 --> 01:10.276
Thus far, the F-3 sixth generation fighter jet has been dubbed the Mitsubishi F-3.

01:10.959 --> 01:14.934
It can be a contender on the global scale when it comes to fighter jets.

01:15.831 --> 01:20.983
Japan does not plan to stop using F-35, even when the F-3 will be completed.

01:21.911 --> 01:26.272
At present, the appearance of the Mitsubishi F-3 is at the concept stage,...

01:26.671 --> 01:29.469
...but some information has been leaked in Japan.

01:30.268 --> 01:31.890
According to the leaked images,...

01:32.249 --> 01:37.245
...the Japanese fighter will be equipped with two engines, most likely XF9-1,...

01:37.447 --> 01:39.503
...with a fantastic afterburner thrust,...

01:39.865 --> 01:44.931
...which is twice the thrust of the AL-31F engine for the su-27.

01:46.416 --> 01:49.264
The possibility of equipping the aircraft with engines...

01:49.363 --> 01:53.127
...with a 20 degree variable thrust vector is also being considered,...

01:53.693 --> 01:57.203
...which will make the Mitsubishi F-3 super maneuverable.
