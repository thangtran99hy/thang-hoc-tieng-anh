Sean Connery was the first, and for legions of fans, the best,...

00:08.463 --> 00:11.162
...the ultimate British spy, James Bond.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.259
Martini, shaken not stirred.

00:13.829 --> 00:17.977
Did you have any idea it would grow to be what it has become?

00:18.095 --> 00:20.049
No, no, nobody did.

00:20.301 --> 00:20.861
Bond.

00:21.023 --> 00:23.137
Connery almost wasn't Bond.

00:23.453 --> 00:26.790
Creator Ian Fleming called him an overgrown stuntman.

00:27.132 --> 00:31.247
The son of a truck driver in Scotland, he joined the navy at 16,...

00:31.591 --> 00:33.974
...but his rugged good looks got him noticed,...

00:34.411 --> 00:36.717
...first, in a Mr. Universe contest;...

00:37.301 --> 00:39.489
...the tough Chicago cop in The Untouchables.

00:39.664 --> 00:41.021
I thank you all sincerely.

00:42.354 --> 00:43.798
The movie roles kept coming,...

00:44.130 --> 00:45.489
Welcome to the Rock.

00:46.035 --> 00:50.034
...so did the honors like People Magazine's Sexiest Man of the Year,...

00:50.412 --> 00:52.581
...not the way Connery saw himself.

00:53.034 --> 00:54.053
Presidents honored him.

00:54.185 --> 00:55.593
The Queen knighted him.

00:55.795 --> 00:59.987
After half a century on screen, Connery retired from acting for good.

01:00.597 --> 01:02.849
I don't look back very much to be honest.

01:03.237 --> 01:05.821
No matter the age, always Bond.

01:06.245 --> 01:07.137
James Bond.
