Authors Erica Dhawan and Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic...

00:03.210 --> 00:06.839
...have a few rules of thumb for communicating with remote teams.

00:07.735 --> 00:10.504
First, since clarity and consistency are key,...

00:10.726 --> 00:14.418
...sticking to a set of agreed upon norms can help avoid confusion.

00:14.820 --> 00:18.261
This could range from a set of acronyms about expected response times...

00:18.549 --> 00:21.629
...to standardizing use of particular communication platforms.

00:22.462 --> 00:25.327
Next, remember that you can never be too clear.

00:25.807 --> 00:28.767
Unless you've established a shorthand protocol ahead of time,...

00:28.959 --> 00:31.421
...don't assume others understand your brevity.

00:32.004 --> 00:36.087
Take the extra time to be extra clear regardless of the medium.
