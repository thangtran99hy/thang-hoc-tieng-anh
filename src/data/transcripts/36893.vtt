Notice that team members who are more introverted in person...

00:04.881 --> 00:07.377
...can really benefit from written communications.

00:07.941 --> 00:10.661
Physical barriers can actually level the playing field...

00:10.763 --> 00:14.175
...for those who may be less inclined to speak in group settings.

00:14.912 --> 00:18.736
Lastly, find ways to celebrate and socialize remotely...

00:18.896 --> 00:23.059
...to strengthen relationships between team members and improve collaboration.

00:23.431 --> 00:26.878
Even a simple switch from conference calls to video, for instance,...

00:27.216 --> 00:29.369
...can boost rapport and create empathy.

00:30.448 --> 00:34.473
The challenges of remote teams will not disappear,...

00:34.739 --> 00:39.328
...but creating consistent rules, rituals and protocols will go a long way..

00:39.516 --> 00:42.188
...in building a new communication skill set.
