For all those of you who voted for President Trump, I understand the disappointment tonight.

00:06.635 --> 00:08.417
I've lost a couple of times myself,...

00:08.909 --> 00:12.173
...but now let's give each other a chance.

00:16.738 --> 00:21.216
It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature,...

00:21.800 --> 00:24.909
...see each other again, listen to each other again,...

00:25.756 --> 00:30.534
...and to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies.

00:31.144 --> 00:33.711
They are not our enemies; they're Americans.

00:34.287 --> 00:35.499
They're Americans.

00:39.263 --> 00:42.865
The Bible tells us, to everything there is a season,...

00:43.431 --> 00:48.525
...a time to build, a time to reap, and a time to sow and a time to heal.

00:48.949 --> 00:51.104
This is the time to heal in America.
