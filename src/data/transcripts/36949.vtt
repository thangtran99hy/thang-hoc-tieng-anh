00:00.945 --> 00:04.046
But while I may be the first woman in this office,...

00:04.286 --> 00:05.519
...I will not be the last,...

00:12.099 --> 00:15.917
...because every little girl watching tonight...

00:16.667 --> 00:20.874
...sees that this is a country of possibilities.

00:22.081 --> 00:27.035
And to the children of our country, regardless of your gender,...

00:27.793 --> 00:31.299
...our country has sent you a clear message:...

00:32.006 --> 00:36.881
...Dream with ambition, lead with conviction,...

00:37.374 --> 00:40.801
...and see yourselves in a way that others may not,...

00:41.503 --> 00:44.213
...simply because they've never seen it before,...

00:44.634 --> 00:48.630
...but know that we will applaud you every step of the way.

00:54.622 --> 00:58.721
And to the American people: No matter who you voted for,...

00:59.679 --> 01:04.762
...I will strive to be a vice president like Joe was to President Obama,...

01:05.391 --> 01:08.502
...loyal, honest and prepared,...

01:09.043 --> 01:12.793
...waking up every day, thinking of you and your family.
