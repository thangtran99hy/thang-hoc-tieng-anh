There is that quote, "Curiosity is the spark behind the spark of every great idea."

00:07.246 --> 00:09.735
And you'll find curiosity right here in Frisco.

00:10.071 --> 00:12.092
No one should feel limited because of their age.

00:12.231 --> 00:16.268
Anika Chebrolu was 14 years old, a 9th grader at Independence High School.

00:16.509 --> 00:19.369
She loves art, loves dancing Indian classical,...

00:19.917 --> 00:23.411
...but her biggest triumph just might be in science.

00:23.743 --> 00:26.888
She just won the National 3M Young Scientist Challenge,...

00:27.215 --> 00:29.594
...used a software method to find a molecule...

00:29.917 --> 00:32.765
...that could open the door for a therapy for COVID-19.

00:33.012 --> 00:34.302
So, stopping that protein,...

00:34.392 --> 00:37.634
...would be able to stop the virus from entering and infecting host cells,...

00:37.701 --> 00:40.039
...which makes it very effective and important drug target.

00:40.433 --> 00:43.571
And at just 14, she knows more than most.

00:44.043 --> 00:47.203
It's work she started when she was in 8th grade at Nelson Middle School,...

00:47.293 --> 00:49.577
...pivoted from influenza to COVID-19...

00:49.885 --> 00:52.383
...when she saw what the virus was doing to her community.

00:53.779 --> 00:59.160
That molecule she found: more than 50 letters long.

00:59.379 --> 01:00.792
Scientists call the house about it.

01:01.037 --> 01:03.774
She has more than 300 interview requests.

01:04.044 --> 01:06.263
This week, she got an offer from a college,...

01:06.819 --> 01:09.663
...but today, she offers you good advice.

01:09.765 --> 01:11.354
Because no question is a bad question,...

01:11.443 --> 01:13.777
...so make sure you stay curious and keep on asking questions.
