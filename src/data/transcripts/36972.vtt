Hi, my name is Philip Colbert.

00:02.341 --> 00:04.791
This is my exhibition, Lobsteropolis, at Saatchi Gallery.

00:05.111 --> 00:09.697
It's the world's first show utilizing tele-present robots for a private view.

00:09.923 --> 00:10.725
It's a world first.

00:14.881 --> 00:16.561
This is something completely different...

00:16.644 --> 00:21.238
...because you can control yourself how you're moving through an exhibition...

00:21.661 --> 00:24.555
...and it's really the closest thing that,...

00:24.633 --> 00:28.493
...it places being in the exhibition space yourself physically.

00:28.943 --> 00:32.867
So, it's actually very exciting now that we can't move...

00:33.015 --> 00:34.862
...and we can't be everywhere at the same time.

00:36.235 --> 00:42.006
This is a wonderful way of attending an auction preview or an exhibition preview...

00:42.653 --> 00:47.095
...and you can get close up to the artwork.

00:47.196 --> 00:50.388
You can have a look at it from near, from far...

00:50.501 --> 00:55.494
...and you get a thing of proportion, so it's a pretty cool way of looking at art.
