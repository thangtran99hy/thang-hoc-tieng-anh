00:00.619 --> 00:02.826
The phone in your hand could be the difference...

00:02.897 --> 00:05.464
...between life and death for our deep seas.

00:06.287 --> 00:11.345
If allowed to go ahead, a new type of mining, called deep seabed mining,...

00:11.444 --> 00:16.741
...will destroy delicate ecosystems on the seabed that have taken millennia to form.

00:18.122 --> 00:20.481
The minerals used in our everyday devices...

00:20.621 --> 00:23.847
like electric cars, laptops and phonesâ€¦

00:24.069 --> 00:26.336
...might soon be mined from the ocean floor.

00:26.961 --> 00:30.426
But we don't need to mine the deep seabed to gather these minerals.

00:30.779 --> 00:32.822
They already exist in our hands.

00:33.244 --> 00:36.902
We can gather these minerals by recycling our old devices.

00:37.004 --> 00:38.698
It's called urban mining,...

00:38.829 --> 00:42.316
...and only involves digging around in your drawers at home.

00:42.726 --> 00:45.356
Even so, we can do more by consuming less, ...

00:45.816 --> 00:48.650
...so think wisely before you buy a new gadget.

00:49.193 --> 00:53.783
Reduce, reuse and recycle and say no to deep seabed mining.

00:54.443 --> 00:56.903
Or we're in deep trouble.
