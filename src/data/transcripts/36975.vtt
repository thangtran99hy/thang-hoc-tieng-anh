Heroes come in many forms.

00:01.940 --> 00:06.019
In comic books, "hero" is often somebody who's got supernatural powers,...

00:06.106 --> 00:08.065
...particularly some type of strength.

00:08.267 --> 00:11.366
Humans, we're all pretty limited in our strength.

00:11.555 --> 00:16.913
But our ability to see injustice and take it on that's really unbounded.

00:17.087 --> 00:20.425
Now, for this epidemic, there really are exemplars...

00:20.659 --> 00:25.981
...who sacrifice their safety or comfort helping society continue to operate.

00:26.132 --> 00:30.351
First and foremost are the health workers who are dealing with lots of sick people and...

00:30.563 --> 00:33.774
incredible overloads, and firemen, bus drivers,...

00:33.958 --> 00:37.867
...people who keep the food supply chain working, even to be a clerk in a store,...

00:38.031 --> 00:40.543
...we depend on these people to show up.

00:40.766 --> 00:44.674
We see those efforts, and thank you for keeping us safe.
