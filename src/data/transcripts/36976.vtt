So far, we've spoken about all of the wonderful benefits that sleep provides,...

00:05.450 --> 00:08.802
...but how much sleep should we actually be getting?

00:13.720 --> 00:16.671
For the average adult, the current recommendation...

00:16.796 --> 00:20.417
...is somewhere between seven to nine hours of sleep a night.

00:20.559 --> 00:24.340
And what we've been finding from large-scale epidemiological studies...

00:24.465 --> 00:28.073
...is that, using that reference point of seven to nine hours,...

00:28.249 --> 00:33.901
...once you start to drop below that, your mortality risk actually starts to increase.

00:34.020 --> 00:39.415
In fact, the Center for Disease Control in the United States, or the CDC,...

00:39.589 --> 00:44.322
...they stipulate a minimum of seven hours of sleep a night for the average adult.

00:44.393 --> 00:48.447
In other words, the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life.

00:48.607 --> 00:54.530
But it turns out that it's not quite a linear relationship as you would expect.

00:54.699 --> 00:57.641
It's not as though the more and more that you sleep,...

00:57.796 --> 01:00.953
...the lower and lower your mortality risk is.

01:01.079 --> 01:03.464
In fact, something strange happens.

01:03.616 --> 01:10.830
Once you get past nine hours, you actually start to see a rise back up in mortality risk,...

01:11.009 --> 01:13.077
...which seems rather strange and peculiar.
