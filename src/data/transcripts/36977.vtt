00:01.719 --> 00:04.341
Finding signs of life on other planets...

00:04.506 --> 00:07.558
...beyond the Earth would be a way of answering the biggest...

00:07.689 --> 00:10.389
...questions that we've had as a species so far.

00:11.067 --> 00:13.469
Where do we come from, are we alone?

00:13.748 --> 00:17.388
Of course these questions are not the exclusive purview of scientists.

00:17.639 --> 00:20.187
People have been asking them for as long as there is any...

00:20.232 --> 00:22.418
...record of them being able to ask these questions.

00:22.843 --> 00:25.915
What is special about this moment and our role in it...

00:25.970 --> 00:28.873
...as scientists, is that for the first time we're actually...

00:29.399 --> 00:33.398
...able because we have the tools to answer these questions.

00:36.304 --> 00:39.401
So a group of scientists, led by Jane Greaves...

00:39.465 --> 00:42.315
...from the University of Cardiff, were looking for signs,...

00:42.350 --> 00:45.805
...for chemical signs on Venus, that shouldn't belong there.

00:46.803 --> 00:49.209
And one of such molecules is phosphine.

00:51.093 --> 00:55.446
And they, unexpectedly, they actually were able to find a signal...

00:55.505 --> 00:57.666
...that belongs to this molecule.

00:59.022 --> 01:04.855
So then, we raced, for us to figure out what could be the reason for phosphine on Venus.

01:05.147 --> 01:07.113
And this is where our MIT team comes.

01:07.308 --> 01:11.421
When we actually looked at all kinds of processes, chemical and physical,...

01:11.664 --> 01:14.589
...that could potentially produce phosphine in Venusian environments.

01:14.930 --> 01:16.240
This is an atmosphere.

01:16.335 --> 01:20.489
The surface of the planet is completely, completely uninhabited.

01:21.488 --> 01:26.937
The atmosphere is the only place in which life actually could, in principle, exist.

01:27.103 --> 01:29.143
There is a belt of clouds.

01:29.714 --> 01:34.347
And we concluded that there is no known chemical and physical...

01:34.443 --> 01:37.149
...process that could conceivably produce phosphine.

01:37.319 --> 01:40.225
So this adds to the mystery of Venus.

01:40.509 --> 01:44.515
And then, this opens, a very, rather bold possibility...

01:44.721 --> 01:48.447
...that there might be something living in the clouds of Venus.
