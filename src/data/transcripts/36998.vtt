00:00.631 --> 00:03.905
Oscar Serna is speaking in a brand new language.

00:09.743 --> 00:12.815
Oscar is both deaf and blind or deaf-blind.

00:13.017 --> 00:16.834
He works at Gallaudet University on a project tracking the evolution of a language...

00:16.970 --> 00:18.819
...for those who can't see or hear.

00:19.207 --> 00:21.895
This new language is called Pro-Tactile ASL.

00:22.266 --> 00:26.936
The ASL stands for American Sign Language, which uses visual signs for words and phrases.

00:28.301 --> 00:31.533
Pro-Tactile ASL communicates entirely through touch.

00:34.072 --> 00:36.178
For example, here's a sentence in ASL:

00:39.119 --> 00:42.608
Here's how Oscar would say the same sentence in pro-tactile ASL.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.815
Historically, deaf-blind people communicated...

00:49.937 --> 00:53.081
...through American Sign Language, Braille and finger spelling.

00:53.385 --> 00:56.273
...where each letter of each word is signed into a person's hand.

00:56.616 --> 01:00.695
Helen Keller, may be the world's most famous deaf-blind person, used finger spelling.

01:01.195 --> 01:04.987
But those are limiting specially when deaf-blind people want to talk to each other.

01:05.486 --> 01:09.969
Pro-Tactile ASL emerged in the early 2000s, as once isolated deaf-blind people...

01:10.134 --> 01:11.567
...began to form communities.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.909
Deaf-blind people have been adapting American Sign Language...

01:15.003 --> 01:17.866
...and adding gestures for things many languages don't have words for.

01:18.547 --> 01:21.253
For example, this tap on the hand is like nodding.

01:23.631 --> 01:25.891
The language has been evolving since.

01:27.766 --> 01:30.851
Now what's new in pro-tactile is that we're seeing things...

01:31.042 --> 01:35.083
...that were used in  visual sign language be transitioned from the use of space...

01:35.361 --> 01:37.024
...to the use of the perceiver's body.
