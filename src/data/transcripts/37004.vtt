00:00.244 --> 00:04.399
This iron worker has made a successful career for herself.

00:04.525 --> 00:05.553
I love physical work.

00:05.732 --> 00:08.691
You may find Adrienne Donato 30 feet above the ground...

00:08.867 --> 00:11.337
...welding and using a handheld jackhammer.

00:11.599 --> 00:14.399
She even worked for the same company through two pregnancies.

00:14.620 --> 00:15.838
They were very supportive.

00:16.037 --> 00:19.624
Iron workers are just one of many fields now trying to recruit women.

00:19.833 --> 00:22.651
The industry just announced the new paid maternity benefit.

00:22.825 --> 00:26.333
They're gonna make good money but they're gonna have great benefits to go along with it...

00:26.410 --> 00:28.619
...so they'll have that health insurance and a pension plan.

00:28.805 --> 00:31.924
And the trucking industry says there's a shortage of drivers.

00:32.534 --> 00:36.899
Driver Jody Edwards and the Women and Trucking Association is trying to change that.

00:37.209 --> 00:40.835
They created a girl scout patch to show trucking isn't just for men.

00:41.093 --> 00:44.203
And Jody is now part of her company's recruiting campaign.

00:44.419 --> 00:49.334
They're trying to tap what is potentially an untapped field of employees,...

00:49.436 --> 00:50.076
...and that's women.

00:50.177 --> 00:54.191
They can come and have a normal day job and they can go home at night.

00:54.389 --> 00:56.908
This training institute says the number of women...

00:56.990 --> 01:00.452
...in its sheet metal apprenticeship program has doubled in two years.

01:00.688 --> 01:03.837
And the Automotive Women's Alliance Foundation offers scholarships.

01:04.107 --> 01:07.217
So, why the push for women in these industries and companies?

01:07.350 --> 01:09.750
It's good to be able to show that they have a diverse workforce.

01:09.832 --> 01:11.677
Whether that helps them to win business...

01:11.749 --> 01:14.003
...or show legitimacy in the markets that they're serving.

01:14.245 --> 01:16.659
Research shows gender diversity in the workplace...

01:16.732 --> 01:19.252
...can lead to higher profits and productivity.
