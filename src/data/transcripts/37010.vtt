Learning happens best when your child gives you good eye contact.

00:12.531 --> 00:14.409
Today we're going to teach you some fun ways...

00:14.583 --> 00:16.872
...to encourage your child to give you eye contact.

00:17.749 --> 00:20.552
Hold your child's favorite toy up next to your eyes.

00:20.965 --> 00:24.941
This will draw your child's attention to the object and therefore your face.

00:25.647 --> 00:28.937
Don't give the child the object until they have given you eye contact.

00:31.290 --> 00:35.327
Put on a mask or funny glasses using something bright,  colorful...

00:35.417 --> 00:39.003
...or a bit silly in your face will encourage your child to look at you.

00:41.929 --> 00:43.791
Play peekaboo with your child.

00:44.199 --> 00:46.973
Use different objects such as a scarf or your hands...

00:47.236 --> 00:48.235
...to cover your face.

00:48.761 --> 00:52.781
Allow your child to pull the object away and then say "boo!"

01:01.186 --> 01:02.791
Blow up a balloon with your child.

01:03.215 --> 01:05.473
Wait for your child to give you eye contact...

01:05.747 --> 01:08.408
...before you blow it up a little bit more each time.

01:17.479 --> 01:20.420
You can also practice eye contact at the playground.

01:20.733 --> 01:24.321
Prepare your child for a swing but don't let them start swinging...

01:24.423 --> 01:25.485
...until they look at you.
