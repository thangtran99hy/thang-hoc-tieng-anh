00:00.039 --> 00:01.908
All kids are a joy to be around.

00:02.079 --> 00:04.858
But Japanese children are some of the most polite, friendly...

00:04.964 --> 00:06.475
...and well-behaved you'll ever meet.

00:07.118 --> 00:09.761
No. 4: The children's nutrition is spot on.

00:11.733 --> 00:15.172
If your little one throws a temper tantrum at the sight of veggies on their plate...

00:15.270 --> 00:17.182
...and they're screaming  for chicken nuggets instead,...

00:17.397 --> 00:19.636
...then this Japanese parenting tip should help.

00:19.841 --> 00:22.332
In Japan, children always have a balanced meal.

00:22.692 --> 00:26.048
Their parents prepare a nutritional lunch that usually includes some rice,...

00:26.289 --> 00:28.293
...vegetables, soup and lean meat.

00:28.524 --> 00:31.405
So when they go to school, they don't scarf down a bunch of junk...

00:31.580 --> 00:34.472
...that doesn't fuel their body but instead gives them mood swings...

00:34.631 --> 00:37.390
...makes them fatigued or on the other end of the spectrum,...

00:37.483 --> 00:39.805
...causes them to be super hyper and unfocused.

00:40.103 --> 00:43.513
Of course, when you eliminate this bad stuff that brings on mental fog,...

00:43.688 --> 00:45.665
...kids can concentrate on their homework and grades.

00:46.055 --> 00:48.545
No. 3: Children must think of others.

00:50.367 --> 00:52.865
If kids everywhere thought about other people's feelings,...

00:53.016 --> 00:55.741
...you'd never see a sibling whack another one with a Lego piece...

00:55.943 --> 00:58.509
...or throwing a temper tantrum in the middle of the grocery store.

00:58.731 --> 01:02.715
From the very early age, parents in Japan teach their children to think of others...

01:02.864 --> 01:04.310
...before they speak or act.

01:04.547 --> 01:07.401
So it's very uncommon to see a child crying uncontrollably...

01:07.567 --> 01:09.087
...or being aggressive in public.

01:09.277 --> 01:12.927
Wherever they are, whether it be at school, restaurants or museums,...

01:13.069 --> 01:14.235
...kids are well-behaved.

01:14.477 --> 01:17.297
They stay in their seat, eat what their parents put in front of them...

01:17.447 --> 01:19.397
...and talk without raising their voices.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.923
This means that even if children are uncomfortable,...

01:21.992 --> 01:23.871
...or something upsets them, they don't show it.

01:24.159 --> 01:28.705
They either keep it to themselves, let it go or express it without making a big scene.

01:28.884 --> 01:31.862
No. 2: Children are highly independent.

01:34.253 --> 01:37.641
Depending on where you live, the thought of letting your child walk to school alone...

01:37.753 --> 01:39.066
...might turn your stomach in knots.

01:39.425 --> 01:43.243
But in Japan, kids as young as seven years old, get to travel to school by themselves.

01:43.605 --> 01:47.385
The Japanese get away with this because they have a phenomenal public transport systems.

01:47.580 --> 01:49.633
And one of the lowest crime rates in the world.

01:49.957 --> 01:54.056
Children are responsible for taking themselves to school and heading back home afterwards.

01:54.239 --> 01:57.417
No. 1: Parents discipline their children in private.

01:59.513 --> 02:03.338
In a lot of countries, when a child is making a fuss in public, yelling...

02:03.459 --> 02:07.539
...or just generally misbehaving, parents might rush to put a stop to things at once.

02:07.826 --> 02:10.457
Many parents discipline their kids in the presence of others.

02:10.769 --> 02:14.623
But Japanese parents tend to do it behind doors and away from prying eyes.

02:14.853 --> 02:18.437
In Japan, parent's are expected to be role models that remain patient...

02:18.537 --> 02:20.103
...when their children are misbehaving.
