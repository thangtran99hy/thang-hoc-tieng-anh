There is out there an appetite against political correctness...

00:03.226 --> 00:04.721
...which is what you have described?

00:04.808 --> 00:08.083
In fact, your YouTube videos are called Professor Against Political Correctness.

00:08.451 --> 00:10.556
But let's make sure we're all speaking the same language here.

00:10.664 --> 00:13.753
You would define that how, political correctness?

00:14.403 --> 00:16.901
Well I think it's a particular kind of ideological game.

00:17.014 --> 00:18.786
And I think the outcome is twofold.

00:18.883 --> 00:21.111
It's to make the player feel morally superior.

00:21.552 --> 00:27.299
And also to take rather serious axe swings at the foundation of society.

00:27.398 --> 00:31.107
And so the game is identify a domain of human endeavor,...

00:31.900 --> 00:34.249
...note that there's a distribution of success.

00:34.517 --> 00:36.093
Some people are doing comparatively better...

00:36.173 --> 00:37.882
...and some people are getting comparatively worse.

00:38.655 --> 00:40.758
Define those doing worse as victims.

00:41.357 --> 00:43.567
Define those doing better as perpetrators.

00:44.069 --> 00:45.662
Identify with the victims.

00:46.059 --> 00:49.877
Have yourself a set of enemies handy to vent your resentment on.

00:50.339 --> 00:53.713
Feel good about it even though it didn't really require any work on your part.

00:54.019 --> 00:55.501
And then endlessly repeat.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.801
And that's why I've seen that happening on campuses in particular...

00:58.915 --> 01:00.105
...for the last thirty years.
