00:03.837 --> 00:06.453
If you're not used to it, working from home can be an adjustment,...

00:07.252 --> 00:11.518
...and it can be specially tough but not impossible if you don't have much extra space.

00:13.433 --> 00:16.685
How can you squeeze an inviting workstation into an already tight space?

00:18.197 --> 00:20.099
Chances are there's a spot in plain sight...

00:20.315 --> 00:22.662
...just begging to be transformed into your workstation.

00:23.743 --> 00:28.108
Swap out an end table by the sofa or a nightstand by your bed with a small desk.

00:30.262 --> 00:31.787
Remove visible distractions.

00:32.603 --> 00:35.785
Only the items necessary for your work should be within arms reach.

00:37.044 --> 00:40.829
If you make video calls, remember to also tidy up the space behind you.

00:41.731 --> 00:44.243
Getting rid of auditory distractions can be harder.

00:45.031 --> 00:46.686
This is where headphones come in handy.

00:48.441 --> 00:51.733
Setting boundaries is especially important if you live with other people.

00:52.355 --> 00:54.544
Have a conversation with roommates, children,...

00:54.635 --> 00:56.837
...your spouse or any other people in your household.

00:57.605 --> 01:00.289
Come up with visual cues so they know when it's safe to approach you...

01:00.455 --> 01:02.803
...and when it's absolutely not okay to do so,...

01:03.836 --> 01:04.892
...but be forgiving too.

01:05.176 --> 01:06.149
In a small space,...

01:06.315 --> 01:10.418
...your workstation just might be in the path of other essential rooms in your house.

01:12.606 --> 01:15.758
If you're going to be living at home with this workstation, you'll need to like it.

01:16.975 --> 01:19.539
Don't outfit your room with boring office furniture.

01:19.903 --> 01:22.531
Find a table that will blend in nicely with the rest of your space.

01:24.127 --> 01:26.531
You need to be able to see your work so you can focus.

01:26.778 --> 01:30.299
Whether you use a table lamp or a hanging ceiling lamp, lighting is key.

01:31.795 --> 01:33.827
You'll need storage to keep your space tidy.

01:34.055 --> 01:37.469
A shelf along the wall can look great here, but a simple rolling cart works too.

01:38.338 --> 01:41.319
Finally, a nice photograph or artwork will go a long way...

01:41.462 --> 01:43.961
...towards making your workstation pleasant and inviting.
