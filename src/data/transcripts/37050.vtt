There's one thing you need to know about the Ring of Fire.

00:02.445 --> 00:05.519
It produces 90 percent of the world's earthquakes.

00:05.745 --> 00:08.605
The Ring of Fire includes about 450 volcanoes.

00:08.827 --> 00:12.719
Many of them are submarine volcanoes, meaning they're underwater...

00:13.160 --> 00:16.887
...as are 75 percent of the world's volcanoes in total.

00:17.149 --> 00:20.266
Now, the Ring of Fire is also called the Circum-Pacific Belt.

00:20.661 --> 00:22.271
It's a result of plate tectonics.

00:22.640 --> 00:27.575
The movement of the plates has created a nearly continuous series of oceanic trenches...

00:27.793 --> 00:33.403
...and chains of volcanoes stretching for 25,000 miles in a horseshoe-shaped pattern...

00:33.644 --> 00:37.112
...from New Zealand, past Japan, across the Bering Strait...

00:37.386 --> 00:39.937
...and down toward the tip of South America.

00:40.378 --> 00:42.073
The plate movement also causes earthquakes.

00:42.316 --> 00:45.021
Because many of these earthquakes occur in the ocean,...

00:45.265 --> 00:47.723
...the Ring of Fire is also known for tsunamis,...

00:48.124 --> 00:51.387
...produced when the ocean floor is either forced to rise or fall.

00:51.608 --> 00:54.003
When a mega thrust event happens in this region,...

00:54.203 --> 00:57.187
...the water is displaced and the water pushes ashore.

00:57.462 --> 01:00.074
Most tsunamis are only a few inches high,...

01:00.524 --> 01:05.555
...but there are times that that wave and that swell can be as tall as buildings.
