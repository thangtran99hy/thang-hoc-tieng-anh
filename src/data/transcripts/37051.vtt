Let's take a quick look at three things you should do...

00:02.621 --> 00:04.671
...to successfully manage your online course...

00:04.927 --> 00:06.828
...and stay motivated throughout the semester.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.645
First, you should carefully read the course syllabus.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.507
It's full of great information.

00:12.033 --> 00:14.099
Many students unfortunately forget to read it...

00:14.243 --> 00:16.650
...and then wonder why they don't understand their assignments,...

00:16.967 --> 00:20.789
...course expectations, important due dates and grading criteria.

00:21.445 --> 00:23.603
At the beginning of each week, you should make it a habit...

00:23.711 --> 00:25.859
...to review the assignments that are due that week...

00:26.068 --> 00:28.142
...and any other activities that need to be completed...

00:28.464 --> 00:29.906
...and set reminders for yourself.

00:30.787 --> 00:33.365
Second, successful students use a calendar to plan...

00:33.431 --> 00:35.141
...and manage their weekly study times.

00:35.529 --> 00:38.745
Remembering to study, participating in online discussions...

00:39.087 --> 00:41.358
...and completing assignments for your online course...

00:41.684 --> 00:44.475
...can be challenging when you're juggling all the distractions of life.

00:45.047 --> 00:47.373
So, make a plan, get organized...

00:47.673 --> 00:51.573
...and schedule all the time you will need to complete your online course requirements...

00:51.886 --> 00:53.261
...and then stick to your plan.

00:54.243 --> 00:57.167
And third, don't be a stranger to your online course.

00:57.583 --> 01:00.623
Log into your course regularly, even daily, if possible.

01:00.982 --> 01:04.009
This is another strategy successful online learners use.

01:04.461 --> 01:07.436
Logging in frequently is associated with higher grades.

01:07.917 --> 01:11.024
Consistent frequent access to your course allows you to respond...

01:11.099 --> 01:12.659
...to important course announcements.

01:12.916 --> 01:17.161
Review course expectations and interact with classmates in discussion boards.

01:17.988 --> 01:19.149
If you do this consistently,...

01:19.683 --> 01:22.289
...you'll build valuable connections with other students in the course...

01:22.388 --> 01:24.752
...and opportunities for cooperation and collaboration.

01:25.072 --> 01:27.505
And this will enrich your online learning experience.
