00:00.284 --> 00:02.925
In a year when so much has been taken from us,...

00:03.714 --> 00:04.751
...we're still thankful...

00:05.899 --> 00:10.502
...not so much for objects or things, but more for each other...

00:11.218 --> 00:13.043
...and what we have the power to do.

00:14.066 --> 00:15.444
This year, with your help,...

00:15.766 --> 00:19.541
...the Simply Give program will provide over 80 million meals...

00:19.824 --> 00:21.685
...to help feed our neighbors in need.

00:22.091 --> 00:25.241
Together, we'll get better and be better...

00:25.827 --> 00:28.241
...because together, we are better.
