Many of us know desserts to be the last guilty pleasure after a meal,...

00:08.253 --> 00:11.093
...but did you know that before the 17th century in Europe,...

00:11.260 --> 00:14.853
...what we know as desserts were used to cleanse the palate between courses?

00:15.453 --> 00:19.459
In many parts of the world, sugar was a rare and expensive ingredient.

00:19.894 --> 00:23.667
It wasn't until colonists generated and expanded the production of sugar fields...

00:23.785 --> 00:26.383
...through slave labor that the price of sugar was lowered.

00:26.906 --> 00:31.005
By the mid-17th century, cookbooks dedicated to desserts were published.

00:31.462 --> 00:34.761
With many different textures, colors, and flavors,...

00:34.948 --> 00:38.195
...here are some of the best desserts that exist around the world.

00:38.757 --> 00:42.006
Yakgwa, meaning "medicinal confection," got its name...

00:42.121 --> 00:44.987
...because honey was known in Korea as healthy medicine.

00:45.693 --> 00:50.071
Yakgwa is a deep-fried cookie soaked in honey for six to eight hours.

00:50.564 --> 00:55.963
The history of this dessert is tied to special occasions like royal banquets or Chuseok.

00:56.811 --> 01:00.414
Though originally enjoyed mostly by the upper class because of the honey,...

01:00.655 --> 01:03.769
...it is commonly eaten today and still served for Chuseok.

01:04.695 --> 01:07.308
The origins of this dessert are a bit murky,...

01:07.873 --> 01:12.219
...with the Catalans saying their crema Catalana preceded France's creme brulee...

01:12.571 --> 01:15.713
...as well as Britain saying its Trinity cream was the first.

01:16.028 --> 01:19.074
However, thanks to chef Francois Massialot,...

01:19.621 --> 01:23.410
...France has the oldest recipe in writing, dating back to 1691.

01:24.172 --> 01:26.225
Creme brulee is a custard topped with sugar...

01:26.322 --> 01:29.463
...that gets torched to create a caramelized, hardened top layer.
