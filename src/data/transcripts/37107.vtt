00:00.395 --> 00:02.807
Hey bud, did you ever think that there's got to be more?

00:02.932 --> 00:03.513
More than what?

00:04.676 --> 00:06.179
The stuff we do, day after day.

00:06.835 --> 00:08.371
Literally, not once.

00:08.546 --> 00:10.330
Today's gonna be different, Goldie.

00:10.647 --> 00:11.621
What are we looking at?

00:13.270 --> 00:13.669
Who are you?

00:13.773 --> 00:15.003
We ran into each other the other day.

00:15.087 --> 00:15.878
How did you find me?

00:15.963 --> 00:18.657
I waited outside by the murder train.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.085
Guy, I have to tell you something.

00:21.314 --> 00:22.757
There is no easy way to say this.

00:22.953 --> 00:24.845
This world, it's a video game.

00:27.627 --> 00:31.241
Buddy, if we're not real, doesn't that mean that nothing you do matters?

00:31.349 --> 00:35.912
I am sitting here with my best friend trying to help him get through a tough time.

00:36.104 --> 00:38.487
Now if that's not real, I don't know what is.

00:39.728 --> 00:44.322
Milly, I know this world is just a game. But this place, these people, that's all I have.

00:46.081 --> 00:46.869
Thanks, Guy.

00:48.015 --> 00:50.099
Guy, in two days, the game is gonna shut down.
