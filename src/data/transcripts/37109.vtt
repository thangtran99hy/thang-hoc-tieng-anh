I didn't know how much I could love, actually love, till I met you.

00:07.327 --> 00:10.413
I've never wanted anything more than for you to be my wife.

00:15.203 --> 00:17.237
This is all I want on my wedding day.

00:21.615 --> 00:22.173
Sol?

00:25.223 --> 00:27.660
Hey, if we get bad news, we should get a dog.

00:28.365 --> 00:29.224
Don't say that.

00:29.598 --> 00:30.624
We're getting good news.

00:34.209 --> 00:34.788
He's ours.

00:37.329 --> 00:39.258
They found cancer, and it's spread.

00:39.949 --> 00:41.095
We don't have much time left.

00:48.229 --> 00:49.839
We knew that this was gonna be hard.

00:49.994 --> 00:51.446
I am in this with you.

00:51.544 --> 00:52.803
I can't do this to you.

00:52.970 --> 00:54.919
You don't get to choose when I tap out.

00:55.199 --> 00:56.168
Do I get to choose?

00:56.295 --> 00:57.771
Not alone, not anymore.

00:59.942 --> 01:02.701
This is gonna be the happiest day of our lives.

01:05.057 --> 01:08.013
Thank you for showing me what living is, what home is.

01:11.255 --> 01:13.276
You make me feel like I can do anything.

01:13.642 --> 01:14.872
We can do anything.

01:15.320 --> 01:17.422
So, one out of five chance that I don't see you next year?

01:17.536 --> 01:18.501
Four out of five, you do.

01:20.919 --> 01:23.925
Every morning, I wake up and I choose you.

01:26.015 --> 01:26.943
I choose us.
