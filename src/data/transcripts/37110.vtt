00:00.275 --> 00:05.859
But, I can recall a very special moment for me, which I keep in my memory.

00:06.625 --> 00:09.547
When I was playing in this Olympiad, game 10,...

00:10.322 --> 00:16.031
...I was concentrated very much on the board and after calculating some lines,...

00:16.132 --> 00:19.766
...I looked up from the chessboard and who did I see?

00:20.549 --> 00:24.091
The world champion Gary Kasparov watching my game.

00:25.147 --> 00:25.879
Wow.

00:28.901 --> 00:35.631
The player who I admired and I respected so much and I learned so much from his games.

00:36.616 --> 00:40.065
It gave me inspiration and gave me energy, too.

00:40.713 --> 00:43.914
I smashed my opponent in that game within a few moves.

00:46.391 --> 00:51.301
After the Olympiad, a journalist asked Kasparov what does he think about my chess.

00:52.915 --> 00:56.920
Do you think that it's possible that one day, Judit will challenge you?

00:58.038 --> 00:59.115
He would say,...

01:00.720 --> 01:04.571
..."I'm absolutely sure that she's going to become the woman's world chess champion."

01:04.729 --> 01:06.253
"But, if we will play?"

01:08.036 --> 01:13.497
And then he continued, "But I'm convinced that it's almost impossible."

01:14.397 --> 01:15.180
Almost.
