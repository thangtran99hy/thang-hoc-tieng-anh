00:00.743 --> 00:04.965
Practice, perseverance, and passion.

00:05.910 --> 00:08.709
These are key elements of my success.

00:09.581 --> 00:12.256
But you may ask whether did I achieve,...

00:12.806 --> 00:18.887
...accomplish my dream to become the world's number one in ultimate competition?

00:19.307 --> 00:21.022
And I have to say, no, I did not...

00:22.253 --> 00:25.191
...but, I did challenge all the top grandmasters,...

00:25.302 --> 00:29.834
...I played in the world championship tournaments...

00:30.077 --> 00:35.073
...and I did beat 11 respected world champions.

00:36.289 --> 00:41.099
After those championships, tournaments, challenges, fights, victories,...

00:41.209 --> 00:42.460
...I have a new dream.

00:43.490 --> 00:49.105
My dream is to see educational chess in all elementary schools...

00:49.291 --> 00:57.012
...because I strongly believe that chess is not only a game, sport and part of culture,...

00:57.377 --> 01:00.299
...but it is an essential educational tool.

01:02.497 --> 01:07.029
I was very fortunate when I was very little to learn the game of chess.

01:07.149 --> 01:09.947
It gave me a lot of success,...

01:10.407 --> 01:12.276
...happiness over the chessboard,...

01:13.560 --> 01:14.934
...but it gave me much more.

01:15.387 --> 01:20.477
It gave me life skills which I use in everyday life whatever I do.

01:21.493 --> 01:27.387
In our multitasking world, I think creativity, logical thinking,...

01:27.603 --> 01:31.887
...problem solving and good decision making are essential skills.

01:32.810 --> 01:35.458
But until my new dream becomes reality,...

01:35.865 --> 01:42.069
...I like to inspire people especially youngsters to dream big,...

01:43.005 --> 01:45.618
...make good moves in life,...

01:46.356 --> 01:49.650
...set your goals high and reach the impossible.

01:50.067 --> 01:50.451
Thank you.
