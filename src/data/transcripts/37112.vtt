Imagine a future where one day...

00:02.549 --> 00:07.019
...machine learning will give you the power to track your sleep, imagine...

00:07.077 --> 00:08.311
Excuse me, ma'am?

00:09.751 --> 00:10.908
Yes, can I help you?

00:11.183 --> 00:13.155
Yeah, this already does that.

00:13.310 --> 00:14.497
Oh, I didn't know that.

00:14.863 --> 00:15.581
Well, now you do.

00:16.137 --> 00:18.622
Okay let's try this again, it's alright, I'll start again.

00:19.345 --> 00:22.685
Imagine one day a tiny device with an optical sensor...

00:22.897 --> 00:25.310
...will send you an alert if your heart rate is too low.

00:26.499 --> 00:27.320
Yes, what?

00:27.855 --> 00:28.856
It already does that.

00:31.236 --> 00:34.860
Okay, well how about will send you an alert if your heart rate is too high.

00:35.075 --> 00:35.995
It already does that!

00:37.611 --> 00:39.083
Alright, let's try something new.

00:39.478 --> 00:42.411
Will send you an alert if you're some place that's too loud.

00:42.749 --> 00:44.995
I just received one of those alerts.

00:45.049 --> 00:48.564
Really, well you should probably find a quieter place sir!

00:48.607 --> 00:51.055
You should probably mind your own business.

00:51.177 --> 00:53.802
Okay, imagine, one day in the future...

00:53.853 --> 00:54.149
Hold on.

00:54.197 --> 00:55.249
No, no, no let me finish!

00:55.312 --> 00:55.889
One second.

00:56.021 --> 00:57.839
You'll be able to take an E-C-G...

00:57.892 --> 01:00.493
It already does that, it already does that.

01:00.586 --> 01:01.235
I heard that.

01:01.376 --> 01:05.031
Good, what about continuously track your elevation, does it do that?

01:05.163 --> 01:05.604
Does that.

01:05.623 --> 01:06.177
Right, got it.

01:06.212 --> 01:06.572
Does that.

01:06.590 --> 01:06.840
Thank you.

01:07.045 --> 01:07.357
Does that.

01:07.457 --> 01:08.609
Yeah, heard it the first time.

01:08.787 --> 01:10.380
Encourages you to stay fit?

01:10.768 --> 01:11.293
Does that.

01:12.997 --> 01:15.509
Okay, I get it, you're fit, umm I don't know.

01:15.537 --> 01:18.817
Will it automatically call 9-1-1 if a bear chases you off a cliff...

01:18.907 --> 01:20.264
...and you take a hard fall, huh?

01:20.649 --> 01:22.137
Yeah, already does that.

01:22.286 --> 01:23.473
Seriously?

01:23.742 --> 01:25.316
Yeah, seriously.

01:25.925 --> 01:26.750
You've got to be kidding me.
