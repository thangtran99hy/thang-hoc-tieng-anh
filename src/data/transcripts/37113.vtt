Now, a specific skill that you need to have when you visit any souk...

00:03.752 --> 00:07.479
...in the Middle East, specifically a gold souk, is that of bargaining.

00:07.970 --> 00:09.597
You need to be able to get the best price.

00:09.951 --> 00:13.214
And you're lucky today, because I am an expert bargainer...

00:13.479 --> 00:15.699
...and I'm gonna show you exactly how to do it.

00:16.068 --> 00:18.247
First step: Be sure of what you want.

00:18.655 --> 00:20.299
I want a gold necklace.

00:20.483 --> 00:23.448
Yes, that is the exact one that I want.

00:24.111 --> 00:28.579
Step number two: Don't be so sure that it's what you want.

00:28.774 --> 00:31.902
Yeah, it's okay; I think so.

00:32.393 --> 00:32.895
How much?

00:33.449 --> 00:35.361
10,530.

00:35.821 --> 00:36.813
Okay, how much for this?

00:39.130 --> 00:40.845
1,367 dirhams?

00:41.313 --> 00:42.241
How much is this?

00:42.967 --> 00:44.868
Ah, there, there, here it comes; there it is.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.363
Why do they always use calculators here?

00:47.949 --> 00:48.654
See, she's laughing.

00:48.785 --> 00:50.221
She knows there's something here.

00:50.305 --> 00:52.201
It's not used for calculations.

00:52.438 --> 00:54.021
It's used for negotiation.

00:54.190 --> 00:55.170
1289

00:55.601 --> 00:58.276
Number three: Always laugh at the first price like it's a joke.

01:00.716 --> 01:01.734
That's okay.

01:01.869 --> 01:05.729
Okay, last price: 10,062.

01:05.904 --> 01:08.609
Number four: Never accept the last price.

01:09.136 --> 01:10.634
I will not accept this price.

01:11.199 --> 01:14.090
Number five: Offer your price.

01:14.333 --> 01:17.905
3,000 dirhams, 800, 700 dirhams.

01:18.699 --> 01:22.921
And number six: Threaten to walk away, then you will always get the deal that you want.

01:23.191 --> 01:25.989
If you don't give me for 3,000, I will leave.

01:27.301 --> 01:29.976
3,000; I'm going.
