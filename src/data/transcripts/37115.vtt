My name is Abigail Whitelow and I am based in London.

00:04.445 --> 00:07.547
For the Dezeen and Samsung Out of the Box Competition…

00:07.986 --> 00:12.731
...I have designed a modular display and storage system called Tessellate.

00:13.590 --> 00:17.213
Tessellate comprises a series of identical modules...

00:17.713 --> 00:19.633
...made from recycled cardboard...

00:20.084 --> 00:22.768
...which can be arranged in many different ways.

00:24.475 --> 00:28.254
This product is designed to be made from a large Eco-Packaging box...

00:28.607 --> 00:33.852
...such as for Samsung’s The Frame television which can produce four modules.

00:35.128 --> 00:39.616
You can arrange them in many ways to create shelving for different rooms.

00:40.345 --> 00:43.617
And it can easily be adapted, giving endless possibilities...

00:43.742 --> 00:46.387
...to a cardboard box that would usually be discarded.
