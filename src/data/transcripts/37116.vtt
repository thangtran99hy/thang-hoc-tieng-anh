00:00.317 --> 00:05.233
Hopes for an overnight return to the old days will certainly be dashed here in France...

00:05.671 --> 00:10.338
...as the lifting of the second national lockdown is said to be a progressive affair,...

00:10.783 --> 00:15.394
...more of a shift into three distinct phases over the next few weeks.

00:16.121 --> 00:19.561
Retail outlets will be able to open from December 1st.

00:20.003 --> 00:22.371
With strict health and safety measures in place,...

00:22.939 --> 00:26.043
...religious establishments will also welcome back worshippers...

00:26.361 --> 00:28.381
...but with limited numbers inside.

00:29.063 --> 00:30.863
Then there are the school holidays.

00:31.222 --> 00:34.737
From December 18th, travel between households should be allowed...

00:35.078 --> 00:37.295
...so people can visit friends and family.

00:37.593 --> 00:41.160
Forms to justify where you are going are unlikely to disappear,...

00:41.528 --> 00:45.977
...but people will no longer be limited to the kilometer surrounding their homes,...

00:46.347 --> 00:49.727
...and once you get there, smaller gatherings are advised.

00:50.071 --> 00:53.334
Above all, authorities want to keep the R rate down,...

00:53.554 --> 00:57.783
...the number of people contaminated by a person suffering from COVID-19.

00:58.345 --> 01:01.542
Scientific data shows that cutting down on interactions...

01:01.821 --> 01:05.794
...keeps contagions and subsequently hospital admissions lower.

01:06.583 --> 01:08.827
The third stage of the lifting of lockdown...

01:08.903 --> 01:11.609
...should come into effect from the beginning of next year...

01:11.903 --> 01:15.961
...when bars, restaurants and sport venues could be back up and running,...

01:16.401 --> 01:20.579
...but that will depend on contamination rates at the end of the holidays.
