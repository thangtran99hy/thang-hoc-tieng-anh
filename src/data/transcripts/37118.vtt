00:00.197 --> 00:01.833
This science fair is big for you.

00:02.034 --> 00:02.860
Good luck at the fair!

00:03.763 --> 00:06.036
Oh my God, it works.

00:06.510 --> 00:07.207
He did it!

00:07.637 --> 00:10.621
I would do anything to acquire this technology.

00:13.010 --> 00:14.576
I fear for Oliver's safety.

00:15.207 --> 00:15.875
Let us out!

00:16.073 --> 00:17.537
Let us out, right now!

00:17.629 --> 00:18.450
Sit.

00:19.136 --> 00:19.833
You sure you're not hungry?

00:20.035 --> 00:21.561
Wait, what? No one said there'd be snacks.

00:21.715 --> 00:23.943
My human is in trouble, and I need your help.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.861
Oh, didn't know you were having an awesome party.

00:27.180 --> 00:28.792
We are gonna save Oliver.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.727
We make a good team, Henry.

00:36.915 --> 00:38.078
How'd you get so smart, Henry?

00:38.267 --> 00:41.429
If you smell as many butts as I have, you tend to pick up a few things.
