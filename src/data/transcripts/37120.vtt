My name is Yuta Tokunaga.

00:03.855 --> 00:05.726
I'm the director of the Archi-Depot.

00:08.737 --> 00:11.282
I was excited about creating the entrance door...

00:11.527 --> 00:15.357
...and also thought about how to make the most of the 5.2-meter-high ceiling.

00:16.546 --> 00:19.287
Opening the giant door leads you into a dark space.

00:19.849 --> 00:23.422
You begin to create your own story as you walk around the maze of models.

00:26.997 --> 00:31.926
Archi-Depot is Japan's only museum solely focused on architectural models...

00:32.009 --> 00:33.731
...that used to be overlooked in Japan.

00:36.703 --> 00:40.081
Japanese architects make many models throughout the design process...

00:40.243 --> 00:42.149
...but a lot of them get thrown away.

00:42.962 --> 00:45.858
Many renowned architects' models ended up overseas.

00:47.657 --> 00:50.306
They've tried to keep as many as they could...

00:50.519 --> 00:53.278
...but there is a problem with space availability,...

00:53.581 --> 00:55.822
...temperature and humidity control.

00:57.286 --> 01:00.329
We wanted to preserve them and showcase them here in Japan.

01:01.294 --> 01:02.909
I think there's so much in a model.

01:04.144 --> 01:09.034
The architect's thought processes, joy, anger, sadness and happiness.

01:09.977 --> 01:10.953
Everything is there.

01:13.735 --> 01:16.411
You don't need knowledge about architecture to enjoy it.

01:18.663 --> 01:21.536
The unbuilt models are called phantom architecture.

01:22.195 --> 01:25.394
You can enjoy imagining what it would have been like to see them in real life.

01:28.341 --> 01:30.571
I wanted to maintain the feel of a warehouse.

01:31.165 --> 01:34.623
You're backstage, discovering the models the architects have hidden away.

01:37.137 --> 01:40.943
All sorts of developments are underway in the lead-up to the next Olympics...

01:41.072 --> 01:43.779
...and many old buildings are being torn down.

01:44.261 --> 01:48.797
I think this museum can pass on the architectural references to the next generation.

01:50.509 --> 01:51.921
The models are fascinating .

01:52.510 --> 01:53.909
They're unfinished products,...

01:54.232 --> 01:57.143
...but there are dreams and a future in them.

01:57.896 --> 01:58.793
They're treasures.
