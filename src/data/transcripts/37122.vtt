I heard about your mother, Jack.

00:03.359 --> 00:03.925
I'm sorry.

00:05.875 --> 00:06.961
I don't remember anything.

00:07.385 --> 00:08.603
You can't remember her,...

00:09.205 --> 00:10.359
...but I cannot forget.

00:14.683 --> 00:17.668
This house deserves to have its history honored.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.688
Everyone lets everyone down at some point.

00:38.507 --> 00:39.796
How do you come back from that?

00:41.579 --> 00:42.735
That's romance.
