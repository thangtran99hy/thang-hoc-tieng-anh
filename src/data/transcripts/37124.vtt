00:00.985 --> 00:04.991
Gone are the days where thousands of people pack into a single space,...

00:05.230 --> 00:08.214
...standing shoulder to shoulder and side by side.

00:08.697 --> 00:11.929
Music festivals and concerts that draw large crowds...

00:12.168 --> 00:14.927
...will probably be off-limits for awhile...

00:15.225 --> 00:19.253
...and so event organizers around the world are coming up with different ways...

00:19.344 --> 00:21.485
...for people to have a bit of fun.

00:23.083 --> 00:25.850
Take this concert in the UK, for example.

00:26.021 --> 00:32.751
Around 2,500 fans gathered at a park in Newcastle to watch a show by musician Sam Fender,...

00:33.030 --> 00:35.240
...but instead of people standing altogether,...

00:35.444 --> 00:39.915
...groups of five are separated on a metal platform at the arena.

00:41.567 --> 00:45.973
Meanwhile, here at home, people are also experimenting with different solutions.

00:46.387 --> 00:51.384
Fans in Toronto were treated to an outdoor concert Thursday night, drive-in style.

00:52.653 --> 00:56.908
Music goers enjoyed The Reklaws from the comfort of their cars.

00:57.075 --> 01:02.041
Another once in a lifetime experience, a new festival inspired by the pandemic.

01:02.323 --> 01:04.131
It's called Krugo Fest.

01:04.305 --> 01:08.121
The event allowed for people in Regina to book a private hotel room...

01:08.237 --> 01:10.787
...and attend a music festival from their balcony.

01:11.079 --> 01:14.383
We've put our stage on the rooftop of a parking structure...

01:14.464 --> 01:17.695
...that's adjacent to the DoubleTree by Hilton in Regina.

01:17.924 --> 01:23.602
The hotel has 108 rooms with balconies that overlook the rooftop stage that we've built.

01:23.929 --> 01:26.387
Morrison says tickets start at 600 dollars...

01:26.667 --> 01:29.590
...which includes a room, a meal and some concerts.

01:29.854 --> 01:33.643
More than that, proceeds from each ticket will go to a local food bank.
