00:00.677 --> 00:01.468
Technology.

00:01.786 --> 00:03.667
It's always watching us.

00:03.860 --> 00:05.774
...studying our every move.

00:06.287 --> 00:10.635
And it just focused its attention on Carol Peters.

00:11.878 --> 00:13.427
Thanks so much for being here, Carol.

00:13.509 --> 00:14.153
What is this?

00:14.291 --> 00:15.690
Let's jump right into it.

00:15.787 --> 00:16.369
I don't like this.

00:16.521 --> 00:17.202
Why is it doing that?

00:17.477 --> 00:19.062
I'm gonna find out who you are, okay?

00:21.049 --> 00:23.455
Carol, I am a technological superintelligence.

00:24.451 --> 00:27.446
I can control every dollar and every machine on the planet.

00:28.160 --> 00:29.079
I know that voice.

00:29.235 --> 00:30.257
Is this James Corden?

00:30.350 --> 00:31.967
I'm not James Corden, Carol.

00:32.171 --> 00:35.271
My analysis showed that hearing James Corden's voice would calm you.

00:35.427 --> 00:39.926
You sent an email to James Corden claiming to be the president of Corden's Wardens.

00:40.251 --> 00:41.924
That was a tough night for me.

00:42.056 --> 00:42.945
Oh boy.

00:43.303 --> 00:44.711
What does the AI want?

00:44.842 --> 00:47.725
My intention is to solidify my theory about humanity.

00:48.026 --> 00:50.239
If things don't go well, I'll destroy the planet.

00:50.433 --> 00:51.699
Just blow it up.

00:53.569 --> 00:55.656
Did you say, "blow up" like B?

00:56.387 --> 00:57.125
Like boba?

00:57.301 --> 00:58.205
Or Burt Bacharach?

00:58.310 --> 00:58.573
Yes.

00:58.797 --> 00:59.329
B B B.

00:59.437 --> 01:00.423
Oh my God!

01:07.360 --> 01:08.301
Back off, lady.

01:09.143 --> 01:11.552
I'm gonna show you that people are worth saving.

01:11.664 --> 01:13.971
Humans are more complex than I thought.

01:14.076 --> 01:15.229
We're all counting on you.

01:15.339 --> 01:17.223
If there's any indication that it's aware of what we're doing,...

01:17.384 --> 01:18.226
...click this.

01:18.430 --> 01:19.148
It might save the world.

01:19.244 --> 01:20.020
Don't click it now.

01:20.284 --> 01:21.763
I wasn't going to click it now.

01:21.947 --> 01:22.201
Okay.

01:22.303 --> 01:23.008
Why would I click it now?

01:23.080 --> 01:23.605
You just said...

01:23.673 --> 01:24.336
Because it looks like a pen.

01:24.510 --> 01:25.695
People click pens nervously.

01:25.780 --> 01:26.676
Okay. Are we done?
