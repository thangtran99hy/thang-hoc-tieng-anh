00:00.721 --> 00:01.993
You have to be careful.

00:02.275 --> 00:04.561
The hurricane could miss Louisiana altogether.

00:04.656 --> 00:05.307
Yeah right.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.025
Because we get what we expect.

00:09.987 --> 00:12.594
I'm open to the possibility that whatever happens...

00:13.067 --> 00:13.838
Oh my God.

00:15.143 --> 00:18.192
...even the bad stuff can lead to better things.

00:18.755 --> 00:20.284
I can't afford a new roof.

00:20.905 --> 00:21.392
Let me help.

00:21.752 --> 00:22.811
Why are you helping me?

00:23.037 --> 00:23.835
Because I can.

00:27.095 --> 00:28.113
How do you know Miranda?

00:28.420 --> 00:29.095
I don't, really.

00:29.389 --> 00:30.431
Why are you fixing her roof?

00:31.333 --> 00:33.594
I just don't want you to blow this.

00:35.194 --> 00:36.015
She doesn't love him.

00:36.357 --> 00:36.969
Not like dad.

00:37.776 --> 00:40.025
All your dad ever wanted was for you to be happy.

00:40.820 --> 00:41.659
How would you know that?

00:43.799 --> 00:44.683
What are you doing right now?

00:45.033 --> 00:46.847
Taking in this gorgeous sunset.

00:48.410 --> 00:50.327
I don't understand what's happening here.

00:50.947 --> 00:52.740
I think you and I collided for a reason.

00:53.755 --> 00:54.344
What's it say?

00:57.767 --> 00:59.044
Mom, what happened to the bumper?

00:59.359 --> 00:59.790
Karma.

01:00.350 --> 01:01.961
Or maybe he's just a lousy driver.
