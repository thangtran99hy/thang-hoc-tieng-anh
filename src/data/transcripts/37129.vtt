While many businesses were shutting down, Co-op was stocking up.

00:06.727 --> 00:09.562
It needed 5,000 extra workers in lockdown.

00:11.267 --> 00:15.521
Co-op Group is owned not by shareholders but by its members.

00:16.920 --> 00:19.130
It's a different model of organizing a business,...

00:19.253 --> 00:22.826
...one that makes its boss accountable for more than just growth.

00:24.363 --> 00:28.896
I'd be very much assessed by the social impact that I can have in communities,...

00:29.252 --> 00:33.227
...by how much money we can raise for good causes,...

00:33.502 --> 00:36.548
...by where our efforts go around campaigning.

00:36.717 --> 00:39.065
And so it's a far more deeper, richer assessment...

00:39.184 --> 00:42.601
...than possibly a PLC CEO might go through.

00:44.105 --> 00:46.973
In those first five years of difficult startup,...

00:47.375 --> 00:51.319
...twice as many co-ops survive than the normal business.

00:51.774 --> 00:56.623
And therefore it suggests to me that our way of working, our governance,...

00:56.991 --> 01:02.049
...our accountability is a better way of doing business.

01:02.445 --> 01:07.843
That way of working will chime with a new zeitgeist of how businesses run.
