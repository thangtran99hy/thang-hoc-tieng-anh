As the UK gets further from the start of this pandemic,...

00:05.057 --> 00:08.567
...business may simply cross over to the next set of challenges.

00:09.464 --> 00:15.203
Unsustainable debt levels and vulnerabilities that COVID has exposed in supply chains...

00:15.305 --> 00:18.041
...and systems geared to ever greater efficiency.

00:19.723 --> 00:22.035
This Scottish manufacturer of outdoor clothing...

00:22.134 --> 00:25.297
...was squeezed when COVID hit its supplies from Asia.

00:25.793 --> 00:30.106
But, it expanded into making medical gowns and overhauled its logistics.

00:32.487 --> 00:36.565

00:54.033 --> 00:58.410
It might also require a shift from customers like the public sector buyers...

...for whom price has tended to trump quality or provenance.

01:02.127 --> 01:08.207
This whole situation has really highlighted how dependent we are on other countries.

01:08.471 --> 01:12.940
I think it will be important for business, people in business...

01:13.025 --> 01:17.825
...and people at government level to start rethinking some of that process.

01:19.759 --> 01:24.265
Has resilience become a higher priority for business and for government?

01:24.429 --> 01:28.267
