00:00.465 --> 00:01.640
Oh, hi Santa!

00:03.301 --> 00:05.977
Good morning! You know what, I can't even fake it.

00:06.181 --> 00:09.673
Look, after the year we just had, the usual gifts...

00:09.865 --> 00:11.639
...are just not going to cut it.

00:11.840 --> 00:14.113
So, we have to find something else and fast.

00:14.555 --> 00:16.496
That's all, figure it out, good luck.

00:17.634 --> 00:18.314
What does that mean?

00:18.475 --> 00:19.317
We are doomed.

00:19.857 --> 00:20.626
What do you think?

00:21.029 --> 00:21.653
Not great.

00:21.857 --> 00:23.911
I should've thought about that before I said it.

00:30.654 --> 00:32.259
Sorry, it's an old habit.

00:33.501 --> 00:34.755
Elf Shopping Network.

00:35.991 --> 00:38.180
Everyone wants a giant jumbo jingle bell.

00:40.267 --> 00:40.443
No.

00:40.607 --> 00:40.970
No.

00:54.704 --> 00:55.227
That's it.

00:57.405 --> 01:00.153
I give you togetherness.

01:02.299 --> 01:03.272
I figured it out.

01:03.471 --> 01:05.502
We're going to gift the holiday spirit.

01:06.263 --> 01:07.104
That sounds dumb.

01:07.297 --> 01:07.927
No, Santa!

01:08.033 --> 01:11.283
We're going to take all those family moments that make the holidays...

01:11.640 --> 01:12.773
...and package them.

01:12.989 --> 01:13.876
It's down to the wire.

01:15.528 --> 01:17.399
The team's been working around the clock.

01:18.645 --> 01:20.797
We had to rethink our whole approach.

01:21.886 --> 01:23.224
I'm not sure it's going to work.

01:23.925 --> 01:24.805
It'll work.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.623
I didn't know you were listening.

01:44.555 --> 01:45.295
That works.

01:45.524 --> 01:48.652
This year has been harder than ever and yet,...

01:49.220 --> 01:53.230
...somehow, you all found a way to pull it off.

01:53.761 --> 01:57.865
You reminded us it's not about toys or the ornaments.

01:58.064 --> 01:58.884
It's about the little things.

01:58.977 --> 02:01.731
Santa? Santa, you're on mute.

02:06.847 --> 02:08.279
I wanted to say thanks.

02:09.329 --> 02:10.660
Thanks for believing.
