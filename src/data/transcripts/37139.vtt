Burns Supper originated when Robert Burns' friends got together after he died...

00:06.855 --> 00:10.723
...as a memorial to his enduring life and legacy,...

00:11.171 --> 00:14.791
...but now it's morphed into a countrywide celebration.

00:15.315 --> 00:17.781
Everyone around Scotland, around the world...

00:17.901 --> 00:20.867

Robbie Burns was voted the Greatest Scot of all time by STV in 2009,...

00:41.849 --> 00:46.798

02:00.721 --> 02:05.033
It's traditionally sheathed in an animal's stomach.

02:05.607 --> 02:09.977
It might not sound delicious, but it's actually really nice.
