Leonardo would write about different topics,...

00:02.241 --> 00:06.731
...how rivers flowed or the symmetry of wings.

00:06.857 --> 00:09.467
You know, flight really fascinated him.

00:09.831 --> 00:12.729
He always wanted to build some artificial flying machine.

00:13.323 --> 00:16.683
He understood things that other people didn't figure out for hundreds of years.

00:16.963 --> 00:20.515
So, he wrote all of his observations in these notebooks.

00:21.079 --> 00:24.139
And all these notebooks, thank God they weren't thrown away.

00:24.271 --> 00:28.763
Some were lost, but a lot are preserved to this day...

00:29.096 --> 00:31.016
...including a small one that I own...

00:31.050 --> 00:34.114
...called the Leicester Codex, which means notebook.

00:34.401 --> 00:37.049
The rest are in European museums.

00:37.332 --> 00:41.537
This idea of visualizing things and being able to draw it out...

00:41.599 --> 00:46.147
...and then talk about the phenomena, that's in all of these notebooks.

00:46.225 --> 00:50.404
And so they're unbelievable contributions to science.

00:50.745 --> 00:56.550
Da Vinci, his whole life was most satisfied by scribbling and trying things out.

00:56.764 --> 01:00.710
If you study things, a lot of things make sense.

01:00.771 --> 01:05.004
Whenever da Vinci would get stuck, he had almost no peers.

01:05.310 --> 01:08.326
In science, he was largely on his own...

01:08.517 --> 01:14.055
...whereas now cool explanations of things are easily at hand.

01:14.109 --> 01:17.486
So it's a great time to go forward with curiosity.

01:17.798 --> 01:23.713
Walter talks about, "Hey, his human mind is not of a different character than yours."

01:24.137 --> 01:26.779
Therefore you know, "Have fun with your curiosity."
