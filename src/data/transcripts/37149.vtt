Now, this shot here that you're seeing is pretty good.

00:05.331 --> 00:09.557
Fairly boring background and well-lit, the angle is good...

00:09.905 --> 00:12.626
...and the sound and the connection is spot on.

00:12.952 --> 00:14.606
That's what you want to aim for.

00:14.867 --> 00:17.480
We don't want something too distracting in the background.

00:17.875 --> 00:23.911
Otherwise, the person on the conference is going to start thinking, "Well, I like that sofa."

00:24.075 --> 00:28.367
"I think I got that cookery book." And they're not going to focus on what you are saying.

00:28.716 --> 00:31.698
So, keep it as neutral and as dull as possible.

00:31.956 --> 00:33.564
They should be focusing on your face.

00:33.861 --> 00:34.565
Nothing else.

00:34.787 --> 00:35.543
Now, we know what to do,...

00:35.619 --> 00:38.429
...let's have a look at some of the mistakes that people make...

00:38.747 --> 00:40.952
...when they video conference from home.
