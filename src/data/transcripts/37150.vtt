Sustenir's vision is to actually grow a more resilient future.

00:03.593 --> 00:05.387
What we do is we grow incredible products...

00:05.469 --> 00:07.469
...that does not only taste better than conventional farming,...

00:07.581 --> 00:10.382
...but is actually 100 percent clean, free of pesticides,...

00:10.482 --> 00:11.831
...and is actually more nutritious as well.

00:12.053 --> 00:15.588
A lot of Singaporeans became a lot more aware about where their produce was coming from,...

00:15.703 --> 00:17.827
...and a lot more concerned about the safety of their products.

00:17.971 --> 00:19.093
I think for the Singapore government,...

00:19.179 --> 00:21.951
...it was very much about the food resilience system that they've built.

00:22.099 --> 00:25.643
Relying on neighboring countries, but when the border shut down, what do we do?

00:25.739 --> 00:28.709
So, there's a big focus now on how do we get our productivity up.

00:29.150 --> 00:31.585
Food security is a rising concern for countries...

00:31.716 --> 00:33.889
...as weather pattern changes disrupt crops,...

00:34.167 --> 00:37.709
...while a growing global population adds stress to food supply chains.

00:38.429 --> 00:41.746
Today, less than 10 percent of Singapore's nutritional needs...

00:41.821 --> 00:45.408
...are produced in the land-scarce country, which is smaller than New York City.

00:45.783 --> 00:49.257
The country hopes to raise that figure to 30 percent by 2030...

00:49.410 --> 00:51.335
...through smart land use and technology,...

00:51.605 --> 00:54.799
...including investments in deep tech start-ups like agri-food.

00:55.014 --> 00:57.437
All the agencies have really collaborated and come together...

00:57.559 --> 01:00.373
...to help companies like Sustenir do the things that we're doing today.

01:00.484 --> 01:02.137
And when we think about R&D, it's very expensive.

01:02.274 --> 01:05.656
We, as a business, want to focus on bringing great products,...

01:05.753 --> 01:09.677
...but we also have to think about how do we further improve the way that we're growing,...

01:09.759 --> 01:13.586
...and so we can think about bringing down our cost and also broadening our product mix.
