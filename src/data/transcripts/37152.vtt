What if you could build something which can transmit the highest amounts of data,...

00:03.712 --> 00:05.543
...like a fiber, but wirelessly.

00:05.689 --> 00:07.787
So, it takes less than 10 minutes to set up...

00:07.901 --> 00:10.793
...and can be nearly infinitely scalable in terms of information.

00:10.928 --> 00:12.160
And that's how this device came about.

00:12.248 --> 00:13.860
Yeah, so you culminated in this?

00:13.975 --> 00:16.355
This is kind of like the size of a small shoe box.

00:16.448 --> 00:18.096
It weighs less than three kilograms.

00:18.179 --> 00:21.071
It's capable of replacing those very expensive fibers...

00:21.246 --> 00:23.135
...on a city level or on a country level.

00:23.345 --> 00:25.447
As the push toward 5G heats up,...

00:25.695 --> 00:29.417
...fast and reliable connectivity is especially crucial for business.

00:30.066 --> 00:33.309
While Singapore ranks as a global leader for internet connectivity,...

00:33.683 --> 00:35.947
...much of Southeast Asia is still catching up.

00:36.574 --> 00:42.251
By 2025, the region is expected to account for almost a third of global 5G deployments.

00:42.732 --> 00:45.932
Rohit wants to make sure that coverage is evenly distributed.
