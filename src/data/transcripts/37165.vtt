Hi! Welcome to Heritage.

00:05.362 --> 00:05.911
Here.

00:06.927 --> 00:07.793
Okay, thanks.

00:08.185 --> 00:09.505
Let's see, so you're returning?

00:09.641 --> 00:11.359
I couldn't find where to return.

00:11.483 --> 00:12.696
I need a replacement.

00:13.361 --> 00:14.702
That's fine, I can help you here.

00:14.799 --> 00:16.255
I'm sorry to hear you had a problem.

00:16.748 --> 00:18.169
We'll take care of it right away.

00:18.655 --> 00:19.809
Can you tell me what happened?

00:20.127 --> 00:22.772
Well, I was coming off your lot and everything was fine...

00:22.861 --> 00:25.833
When a customer is unhappy, let them tell their story.

00:26.001 --> 00:28.940
They want to feel they've been heard and that somebody cares.

00:29.040 --> 00:30.295
The car started shaking.

00:30.433 --> 00:33.327
Then, ask questions that help you guide them to a solution.

00:33.525 --> 00:37.703
So, the steering didn't feel quite right but you were still able to control the car?

00:37.933 --> 00:38.885
Well, just barely.

00:39.583 --> 00:41.189
Control your own emotions.

00:41.530 --> 00:46.158
Instead of taking it personally, stay calm and focus on solving the problem.

00:46.411 --> 00:48.887
It often helps to find something you can agree with.

00:49.497 --> 00:53.440
This shows your willingness to work with the customer to solve the problem.

00:53.561 --> 00:56.205
Someone should have told me that your lot would be closed.

00:56.761 --> 00:58.217
Yes, I'm sorry about that.

00:58.335 --> 01:00.749
We weren't expecting you back before the lot reopened.

01:00.904 --> 01:03.441
But, it would have been good to mention it just in case.

01:03.568 --> 01:04.335
No kidding.

01:04.560 --> 01:08.297
Well, let me see what I can do because I'm sure we can make this right for you.
