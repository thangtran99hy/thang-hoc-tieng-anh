Hi, this is Jason.

00:01.410 --> 00:02.645
How can I help you this afternoon?

00:03.827 --> 00:04.638
You tell me!

00:05.037 --> 00:06.456
I'm looking at my new statement...

00:06.719 --> 00:09.086
...and I see that you people have charged me again...

00:09.181 --> 00:11.570
...for the same fees I've been calling about for months now.

00:11.786 --> 00:15.503
I'm sick and tired of being told that it's handled when pretty clearly, it's not.

00:16.273 --> 00:17.493
I'm so sorry to hear that.

00:17.715 --> 00:20.087
Let me take a look at your account and find out what's going on.

00:21.059 --> 00:22.282
Can you remind me when this started?

00:23.009 --> 00:23.393
Fine!

00:23.565 --> 00:25.660
The first fee showed up three months ago.

00:25.745 --> 00:27.849
If you can't fix this, I'm going to close the account.

00:30.228 --> 00:32.121
I completely understand your frustration.

00:32.251 --> 00:34.910
Let me see what I can do to help get this taken care of for you right now.

00:35.773 --> 00:37.862
I'm glad I was able to get that issue taken care of.

00:38.183 --> 00:40.629
It may take up to 24 hours for your account to show the changes...

00:40.718 --> 00:42.871
...but you shouldn't see any more of these fees in the future.

00:43.361 --> 00:45.001
Thanks for working with me to figure it out.

00:45.514 --> 00:47.490
I want to apologize again for the inconvenience.

00:48.724 --> 00:51.240
Thanks, Jason, I appreciate your help.
