Due to the pandemic, many of us will most likely be doing our holiday shopping online,...

00:06.099 --> 00:10.167
...but before you start loading your cart and inputting that card number,...

00:10.315 --> 00:14.260
...you may want to take a step back to make sure your transaction is safe...

00:14.384 --> 00:16.825
...and you're applying deals when they're available.

00:17.008 --> 00:21.323
Check comparison sites and reviews to ensure you're getting a good deal.

00:21.503 --> 00:25.973
Look for reviews about the seller's reputation and customer service.

00:26.082 --> 00:28.526
You'll also want to look for coupon codes.

00:28.687 --> 00:34.257
You can search the retailer's name with the terms "discount," "coupon" or "free shipping."

00:34.433 --> 00:38.242
Check if the website's address starts with "https."

00:38.337 --> 00:43.375
If you don't see the "s," which stands for "secure," don't enter your information.
