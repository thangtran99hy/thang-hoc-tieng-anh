00:00.259 --> 00:04.677
The most human trait is to want to know why.

00:05.761 --> 00:08.670
And in a year that tested everyone around the world,...

00:09.367 --> 00:10.894
..."why" was searched more than ever.

00:15.867 --> 00:20.025
The spread of the coronavirus has passed a significant milestone.

00:20.373 --> 00:23.826
And while we didn't find all the answers, we kept asking.

00:25.246 --> 00:30.169
Some questions inspired joy; others, excitement.

00:31.264 --> 00:33.544
Life in the bubble, whoo!

00:33.831 --> 00:34.579
Do you love me?

00:34.772 --> 00:35.209
Yes.

00:35.343 --> 00:36.037
Do you love me?

00:36.227 --> 00:36.685
Yes.

00:36.911 --> 00:37.891
Do you love me?

00:38.024 --> 00:38.496
Yes.

00:38.614 --> 00:41.527
I don't know what an improper fraction is.

00:41.575 --> 00:44.841
Teachers should make a billion dollars.

00:44.993 --> 00:46.683
We found toilet tissue, y'all.

00:47.478 --> 00:48.958
Put it on there, and start it up for me.

00:49.023 --> 00:50.192
What are y'all doing?

00:51.365 --> 00:55.987
It's still March, how many days in March?

00:56.756 --> 00:58.017
Some questions made us cry.

00:58.421 --> 01:00.421
You know, we've been through our ups and been through our downs.

01:00.968 --> 01:03.561
I think the most important part is that we all stay together throughout.

01:04.629 --> 01:05.671
I love you guys!

01:08.667 --> 01:11.417
Some made us worry about this spinning rock we call home.

01:11.796 --> 01:14.327
Fires were detected in the Amazon rainforest.

01:16.329 --> 01:17.891
Why were so many lives lost?

01:18.177 --> 01:23.092
Almost 1.5 million people have now died of COVID-19 worldwide.

01:24.124 --> 01:26.390
Why are we still asking the same questions?

01:26.521 --> 01:30.728
George Floyd repeatedly told the officers that he could not breathe.

01:33.313 --> 01:35.453
So why do we still have strength to continue?

01:36.983 --> 01:41.069
I believe in your power.

01:41.369 --> 01:45.489
I believe in our power.

01:45.684 --> 01:49.309
Chants of "Black Lives Matter" echoed from thousands of protesters...

01:49.432 --> 01:51.081
...in cities around the world.

01:51.193 --> 01:52.455
Why are we not defeated?

01:52.747 --> 01:56.861
We have made too much progress, and we are not going back.

01:57.203 --> 01:59.771
We are going forward.
