00:00.111 --> 00:03.292
You are you, there's no one else like you...

00:03.755 --> 00:06.986
and you're not like anyone else, you're a true original.

00:07.683 --> 00:10.127
What we have in common is that we're all unique.

00:10.894 --> 00:14.077
Balance believes that how you meditate should reflect who you are...

00:14.259 --> 00:16.102
...which is why this approach is different.

00:16.973 --> 00:21.124
Balance adapts to you for whatever reason you're on this journey,...

00:21.475 --> 00:24.147
...however long you've been here and no matter where you're headed.

00:25.053 --> 00:26.895
You're asked questions every step of the way...

00:27.318 --> 00:30.270
...like which techniques you enjoy, how fast you're learning...

00:30.570 --> 00:32.415
...and what you want out of your experience...

00:32.876 --> 00:36.021
...and each guided meditation adjusts to meet your needs.

00:36.449 --> 00:39.309
With thousands of paths diverging from your responses...

00:40.099 --> 00:42.985
...meaning you build core meditation skills at your own pace.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.322
And the route you take is as unique as you.

00:47.105 --> 00:49.789
We know that meditation isn't one-size-fits-all.

00:50.579 --> 00:55.123
Balance brings you a truly personalized approach because you're you.
