When it comes to email, good etiquette is not about the fancy flourishes,...

00:05.287 --> 00:07.955
...it's about respecting other people's time.

00:09.399 --> 00:12.389
When I was researching my recent book on digital etiquette,...

00:12.935 --> 00:17.520
...one of the people I spoke to was American writer and podcaster Merlin Mann.

00:18.400 --> 00:21.543
He's the person who coined the term Inbox Zero.

00:22.010 --> 00:23.022
If you haven't heard of that,...

00:23.093 --> 00:26.463
...it's basically a method for staying on top of your unread emails.

00:26.910 --> 00:30.187
I won't get into it here, but if you have an overfull inbox,...

00:30.673 --> 00:31.893
...it will change your life.

00:32.995 --> 00:37.850
Anyway, when I asked him what he thought constituted good email etiquette,...

00:38.227 --> 00:42.311
...he said, "Assume that everyone you're communicating with...

00:42.577 --> 00:47.373
...is smarter than you and cares more than you and is busier than you."

00:48.406 --> 00:50.093
I think that's excellent advice.

00:50.990 --> 00:53.163
So, no waffling.

00:53.636 --> 00:54.655
No jargon.

00:54.980 --> 00:56.239
No small talk.

00:56.647 --> 01:00.941
You do not have to ask after your recipient's health every time you email them.

01:02.286 --> 01:06.579
That said, it is possible to be too concise.

01:06.705 --> 01:10.445
There's a line where brevity crosses over into rudeness.
