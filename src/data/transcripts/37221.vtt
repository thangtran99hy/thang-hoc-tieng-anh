I'll keep this one simple.

00:03.224 --> 00:06.649
There is a correct way to sign off an email.

00:07.574 --> 00:10.312
It is "Best wishes."

00:11.568 --> 00:14.807
"Best" and "All the best" are also acceptable.

00:15.297 --> 00:15.971
Anything else?

00:16.717 --> 00:17.895
Sorry, no.

00:19.015 --> 00:20.047
"Yours sincerely"?

00:20.756 --> 00:21.547
Too formal.

00:22.497 --> 00:23.002
"Yours"?

00:23.818 --> 00:24.978
Too intimate.

00:26.137 --> 00:26.807
"Cheers"?

00:27.563 --> 00:30.920
Okay for friends, but too casual for a professional context.

00:31.834 --> 00:32.902
"BW"?

00:33.099 --> 00:33.857
Tacky.

00:34.536 --> 00:35.595
"Kind regards"?

00:35.988 --> 00:37.450
Just a bit pompous.

00:38.965 --> 00:40.319
Those are all terrible,...

00:40.847 --> 00:47.709
...but my absolute least favorite email sign-off is "Thanks in advance."

00:50.797 --> 00:52.659
What's wrong with "Thanks in advance"?

00:53.771 --> 00:56.153
It's incredibly presumptive,...

00:56.375 --> 01:00.406
...you can't thank someone for doing something before they've agreed to do it.

01:00.763 --> 01:02.819
That's not how gratitude works.

01:03.985 --> 01:06.101
When you say "Thanks in advance" in an email,...

01:06.171 --> 01:10.077
...you're basically saying, "Hey, by the way, you have no choice whether to do this or not."

01:12.918 --> 01:17.113
So, stick to "Best" or "Best wishes," and you can't go wrong.
