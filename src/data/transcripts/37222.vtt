There may come a time when you want to send an email to multiple people at once,...

00:04.268 --> 00:07.361
...at which point you may wish to make use of the CC feature.

00:08.297 --> 00:14.021
Now, if you take one thing away from this talk, let it be the CC rule.

00:15.547 --> 00:19.923
The CC rule states that primary recipients of an email,...

00:20.307 --> 00:23.965
...who are expected to respond, should go in the "To" field.

00:25.046 --> 00:28.956
Other recipients of an email, who are not expected to respond...

00:29.281 --> 00:32.734
...and who are included as a courtesy or for their information,...

00:33.065 --> 00:35.152
...should go in the "CC" field.

00:36.179 --> 00:40.223
Next time you receive an email that's been addressed to multiple people, take a look:...

00:40.311 --> 00:44.039
...Are you a primary recipient, or are you on CC?

00:44.248 --> 00:45.575
Do you need to respond?

00:46.747 --> 00:53.809
What I love about the CC rule is it makes the expectations on your recipients so clear.

00:54.205 --> 00:56.951
If you're in the "To" field, you should respond;...

00:57.276 --> 00:59.981
...if you're on the "CC" field, you should not respond.

01:00.615 --> 01:06.959
And it also reduces the burden of email by hopefully cutting back on the number of emails sent.

01:07.277 --> 01:10.924
Those people on CC don't have that awkward moment where they're wondering,...

01:11.386 --> 01:13.465
..."Am I expected to pitch in here?"

01:14.108 --> 01:16.745
The CC rule will change your email life.
