00:00.003 --> 00:01.058
The objective is clear:...

00:01.633 --> 00:04.917
...prioritize the elderly and those most at risk from COVID-19.

00:05.719 --> 00:08.479
That was the message delivered from France's national health authority...

00:09.333 --> 00:11.979
...as it laid out a comprehensive vaccine rollout strategy...

00:12.255 --> 00:14.223
...comprised of five specific phases.

00:14.859 --> 00:17.167
As soon as the first batch of vaccines arrive in the country,...

00:17.597 --> 00:19.714
...phase one of the rollout will see them set aside...

00:19.809 --> 00:23.973
...for over 650,000 elderly residents in France's nursing homes.

00:24.656 --> 00:26.610
Phase 2 will then see a mass expansion,...

00:27.115 --> 00:29.068
...first to reach people over the age of 75,...

00:29.397 --> 00:32.779
...then to people age 65 and up suffering with comorbidities...

00:33.254 --> 00:36.074
...and finally to all people between 65 and 74.

00:37.134 --> 00:38.916
The third phase follows in a similar pattern.

00:39.263 --> 00:41.544
People over the age of 50 will receive the vaccine...

00:41.823 --> 00:44.624
...followed by those under 50 suffering with comorbidities.

00:45.385 --> 00:49.629
Then in phase 4, people who have been in high risk contact with coronavirus cases...

00:50.117 --> 00:53.203
...and who have never previously received vaccines will be prioritized.

00:53.925 --> 00:55.847
And in the 5th and final phase of the rollout,...

00:56.245 --> 00:59.876
...all people 18 and up who don't currently suffer from comorbidities...

01:00.258 --> 01:01.817
...will be able to receive vaccines.

01:03.012 --> 01:06.081
Millions of vaccines are currently in transit to the European Union,...

01:06.372 --> 01:08.761
...of which France is set to receive about 15%...

01:09.122 --> 01:12.929
...with the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021 currently being earmarked.

01:13.553 --> 01:16.802
However, French authorities will have to do more to persuade locals.

01:17.373 --> 01:20.054
Recent surveys by France's Institute of Public Opinion...

01:20.335 --> 01:24.450
...show more than 59% of French don't intend to take COVID vaccines,...

01:24.852 --> 01:27.529
...which will not be made compulsory by government.
