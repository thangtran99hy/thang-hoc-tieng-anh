..."Gravity Tank, this is Megan" so they know who they're speaking to.

00:08.757 --> 00:14.504
Get the basics which is their name and who they're working for and their contact info.

00:15.059 --> 00:20.289
But, if they lead in to say something like "Oh, I'm interested in working here"...

00:20.369 --> 00:23.662
...or "I'm interested in working with the company,"...

00:23.745 --> 00:28.871
...you can ask in what ways and then you would know further about who to have them contact.

00:29.484 --> 00:32.324
Get as much information as you can before you get them off the phone.
