A warehouse piled high with kitchenware near Tokyo...

00:04.320 --> 00:07.026
...is a graveyard showing the toll the global health crisis...

00:07.099 --> 00:09.426
...took on the city's restaurants in 2020.

00:09.701 --> 00:13.094
Stacks of old sinks, fridges, pots, pans and chairs...

00:13.495 --> 00:16.495
...are all being refurbished and sold on by Tenpos Busters,...

00:16.838 --> 00:18.593
...a secondhand kitchen supplier.

00:18.779 --> 00:20.453
For them, it has been a bumper year.

00:21.020 --> 00:24.014
Takahito Tooyama, the firm's sales director...

00:24.286 --> 00:26.361
...says it bought double the amount of goods.

00:28.193 --> 00:32.168
In normal years, our warehouse doesn't get full or overflow with products,...

00:32.475 --> 00:35.729
...but because of the rising number of businesses or restaurants closing...

00:35.838 --> 00:39.103
...due to the coronavirus, our warehouse is overflowing.

00:40.604 --> 00:42.753
Between February and mid-December this year,...

00:42.829 --> 00:46.867
...around 126 restaurants and bars have gone bust in Japan.

00:47.339 --> 00:48.631
One of those forced to close...

00:48.707 --> 00:53.518
...was the ramen noodle shop Shirohachi in Tokyo's business district.

00:53.836 --> 00:59.451
Yashiro Haga, its owner, got 165 dollars selling his old kitchenware to Tenpos Busters.

01:00.918 --> 01:03.809
I've been slowly cleaning the shop by myself every day.

01:04.278 --> 01:07.246
Now that my stuff is gone, the shop is bare and empty.

01:07.526 --> 01:08.483
It makes me sad.

01:08.841 --> 01:13.466
Yashiro's premises is small, so social distancing and profits proved incompatible.

01:13.843 --> 01:16.163
Combine that with people encouraged to work from home...

01:16.596 --> 01:19.797
...and his business of 15 years became unfeasible.
