00:01.311 --> 00:06.311
The time between the election and the inauguration is called the transition.

00:06.571 --> 00:09.103
The new president assembles an administration...

00:09.255 --> 00:11.737
...and prepares to start running the federal government.

00:12.151 --> 00:15.853
The job is run by a transition team, separate from the campaign,...

00:16.111 --> 00:17.767
...with its own staff and budget.

00:18.239 --> 00:21.451
The transition team develops goals and strategies...

00:21.567 --> 00:24.181
...for the early days of the new administration.

00:24.629 --> 00:26.167
Here's what is to be decided:...

00:26.463 --> 00:29.289
...how to turn campaign promises into policy,...

00:29.546 --> 00:31.764
...what to do first and what to do later...

00:32.031 --> 00:35.179
...and whether to roll back actions of the previous president.

00:35.485 --> 00:40.359
The federal government provides office space and financial resources needed to do the work.

00:40.637 --> 00:43.687
It also does background checks for security clearances.

00:44.079 --> 00:47.148
Private donors are allowed to contribute to the transition,...

00:47.411 --> 00:50.211
...up to the limit of 5,000 dollars per person.

00:50.679 --> 00:55.074
Rapidly-decided elections give the transition team about 11 weeks,...

00:55.343 --> 00:59.883
...but the contested 2000 election ended with only 39 days remaining.

01:00.605 --> 01:05.386
Ready or not, a president will be sworn in at noon on  January 20th.

01:05.731 --> 01:09.502
With a smooth transition, the new president can have a team in place,...

01:09.665 --> 01:11.611
...ready to work on a new agenda.
