00:00.529 --> 00:01.775
I started losing my vision...

00:01.902 --> 00:04.951
...around the same time that I started teaching myself how to cook.

00:05.374 --> 00:07.055
Every time my vision would decrease,...

00:07.140 --> 00:11.286
...I would have to teach myself again how do I use the stove or how do I use a knife.

00:11.418 --> 00:13.895
Just trying to get better every day with every recipe I made.

00:15.975 --> 00:19.485
I'm best known for winning a cooking competition on television.

00:21.601 --> 00:24.896
I also wrote a cookbook that made it onto the best seller list.

00:25.388 --> 00:28.341
Now, I'm considered an insider in the industry.

00:30.721 --> 00:34.715
As someone who's visually impaired, measuring liquids has been a challenge.

00:35.171 --> 00:38.423
I use voice-activated technology a lot in the kitchen,

00:38.677 --> 00:42.583
It's just much easier to speak to a device whether it's measurements,...

00:42.706 --> 00:44.602
...getting equipment to turn on or off.

00:47.056 --> 00:50.411
Cooking is a very central process.

00:51.151 --> 00:54.259
Because I don't have the sense of sight, when I taste something,...

00:54.633 --> 00:56.657
...I really break it down in my head.

01:01.203 --> 01:04.237
I picture exactly how I want the dish to look.

01:05.333 --> 01:08.048
I have the memory of what colors looked like,...

01:08.128 --> 01:11.765
...so I know what white, what orange, what green look like,

01:12.853 --> 01:17.633
So, I imagine first, I think, the art on a dish.

01:24.338 --> 01:26.183
This is when I feel the most Zen.

01:28.055 --> 01:32.649
Pho is a dish that even though it's that simple, it's hard to execute.

01:33.243 --> 01:35.188
Although each time I make it, it gets better and better,...

01:35.307 --> 01:39.623
...it has yet to still capture the memory of my mom's.

01:41.129 --> 01:44.775
Whether it's trying to get through challenges to win a cooking competition,...

01:44.933 --> 01:46.493
...to opening a restaurant,...

01:46.683 --> 01:49.329
...to just trying to replicate my mom's beef noodle soup.

01:49.753 --> 01:53.147
You just have to try over and over until you succeed.
