00:00.769 --> 00:02.571
The overarching goal of Project Natick...

00:02.822 --> 00:05.337
...is to evaluate the feasibility of underwater data centers.

00:05.807 --> 00:07.417
Phase one was just to be able to figure out,...

00:07.607 --> 00:09.396
...can we get computers into a container...

00:09.506 --> 00:11.399
...and can we deploy them in the water without it leaking,..

00:11.525 --> 00:14.001
...and do the computers survive and how well do they last?

00:14.495 --> 00:22.523
Phase two was to show that we can make it in a manufacturable production scale component.

00:22.967 --> 00:27.931
So, the container behind me, it fits on a trailer, it fits on a cargo ship,...

00:28.038 --> 00:32.780
And it allows us to actually build up this data center to any size that we want.

00:33.373 --> 00:38.184
Computers are not designed to work in an environment that we humans operate.

00:38.371 --> 00:41.920
So, things like oxygen, moisture in the air,...

00:42.359 --> 00:45.839
...that is really bad for computers, it causes corrosion on the components.

00:46.336 --> 00:48.231
You also get temperature fluctuations.

00:48.347 --> 00:52.597
So, the heat from night to day and summer to winter can cause those components to fail...

00:52.713 --> 00:55.225
...and so we had this theory that if we're really in a stable environment,...

00:55.491 --> 00:57.739
...we're in this cylinder, we've taken all the oxygen out.

00:57.818 --> 00:58.972
We've controlled the humidity.

00:59.321 --> 01:00.689
No one's walking around.

01:00.787 --> 01:03.800
There's nobody bumping things and causing any additional failures...

01:03.917 --> 01:05.137
...that we'd see better reliability.

01:05.744 --> 01:09.932
And so far, as we've been monitoring this and the data center that we have on land...

01:10.399 --> 01:11.758
...that are using the same components,...

01:11.922 --> 01:16.569
...we see one-eighth the failure rate in the ocean data center than we do on land.

01:17.465 --> 01:19.655
We got some good data on reliability.

01:19.890 --> 01:22.617
We've proven out that we can do this whole deployment process.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.000
Now, let's finish the story and let's show that we can do the retrieval...

01:26.076 --> 01:28.847
...and we can do the recycling once it does reach end of life...

01:29.120 --> 01:31.957
...and make sure that that entire cycle is possible,

01:33.446 --> 01:37.681
This project gives us the ability to feel like we're working not just on computers,...

01:37.776 --> 01:43.263
...not just on data centers, but on sort of moving forward environmental responsibility...

01:43.405 --> 01:45.131
...as a company and as individuals.
