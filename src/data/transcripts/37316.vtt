00:00.252 --> 00:05.079
It was a scene Americans never expected to see, not in their country.

00:05.522 --> 00:09.085
The images ricocheted around the nation on TV...

00:09.538 --> 00:12.344
...and private chat groups on social media.

00:13.300 --> 00:16.325
It started with a peaceful gathering Wednesday...

00:16.493 --> 00:18.224
...headlined by President Donald Trump...

00:18.430 --> 00:22.055
...to protest the results of the US presidential election.

00:22.798 --> 00:25.895
Just a mile away, a joint session of Congress...

00:26.239 --> 00:29.377
...began the process of certifying those results.

00:29.875 --> 00:31.076
We will never give up.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.745
We will never concede.

00:32.851 --> 00:33.757
It doesn't happen.

00:33.861 --> 00:36.752
You don't concede when there's theft involved.

00:39.105 --> 00:42.297
Trump suggested protesters walk to the Capitol.

00:42.847 --> 00:45.082
As the crowd approached the building,...

00:45.446 --> 00:49.438
...they pushed up against police lines and their demeanor changed.

00:49.811 --> 00:53.718
They forced their way into the building and lawmakers fled.

00:54.515 --> 00:57.750
Seeing protesters in US cities is not unusual.

00:58.073 --> 01:03.078
Over the summer, unrest, at times, turn to violence and destruction,...

01:03.795 --> 01:07.817
...but what happened Wednesday in Washington DC was different.

01:08.324 --> 01:12.101
As night fell, and Washington fell under a curfew,...

01:12.481 --> 01:15.401
...a stunned nation grappled to understand...

01:15.638 --> 01:18.075
...what led to this unprecedented moment.

01:18.471 --> 01:22.498
The Capitol Building, the scene of so many historical moments,...

01:23.014 --> 01:24.155
...but nothing like this.
