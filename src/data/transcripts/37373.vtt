Normally, this time of the year, the entire tech world is touching down in Las Vegas,...

00:05.075 --> 00:12.135
...for a big week of news, strange gadgets and lots of walking around a giant show floor.

00:12.476 --> 00:19.466
But this year, the pandemic means that CES' 2.9 million square feet of exhibition space...

00:19.826 --> 00:22.917
...are being replaced by an all digital event.

00:24.406 --> 00:28.856
Brands like LG and Procter & Gamble are creating virtual booths online...

00:28.945 --> 00:32.073
...instead of the flashy physical exhibits we've seen in the past.

00:32.457 --> 00:35.805
Panasonic is hosting a virtual concert by Cold War Kids...

00:36.071 --> 00:41.313
...and instead of packed keynotes, all the big press conferences are streaming online.

00:41.597 --> 00:43.399
Now, details are still under wraps...

00:43.549 --> 00:48.067
...but we're expecting to see the launch of three new Galaxy S21 phones...

00:48.251 --> 00:53.024
...with better cameras and maybe even an integrated S Pen like we've seen on the Note.

00:53.211 --> 00:57.216
LG is launching a range of mini LED TVs known as QNED...

00:57.457 --> 01:01.503
...and we're probably going to expect shiny new OLEDs from LG TV as well.

01:01.897 --> 01:06.897
LG Display is also showing off a transparent OLED for commercial applications.

01:07.515 --> 01:11.187
Samsung has also unveiled a range of new microLED TVs...

01:11.460 --> 01:16.900
...including a 110-inch model with a 156,000-dollar price tag,...

01:17.239 --> 01:21.563
...as well as new QLED models and an updated version of its Frame TV,...

01:21.648 --> 01:24.295
...which is designed to look like an artwork on your wall.

01:24.764 --> 01:28.015
Now, CES is normally a show for high-tech gadgets...

01:28.144 --> 01:31.055
...but it's also a show for high-tech appliances.

01:31.762 --> 01:35.432
Samsung is launching its new Bespoke refrigerator range...

01:35.704 --> 01:39.116
...with a modular design available in pastel pink and blue,...

01:39.440 --> 01:42.037
...and LG is upgrading its InstaView refrigerator...

01:42.137 --> 01:44.415
...with a door that opens via voice command...

01:44.725 --> 01:49.190
...and a water dispenser that sanitizes your water with UV light.
