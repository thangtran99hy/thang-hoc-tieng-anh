00:00.391 --> 00:04.927
So, what do you make of that in and of itself?

00:05.111 --> 00:07.079
Seven hundred percent in a year?

00:07.828 --> 00:11.340
Elon Musk is now the richest person in the world as of today, passes Jeff Bezos.

00:13.088 --> 00:15.539
Yeah, it's really incredible actually.

00:15.608 --> 00:17.749
I mean, he's somebody I've known for a really long time.

00:17.914 --> 00:19.811
I've looked up to him for a long time.

00:20.346 --> 00:23.339
And here's what I would say that he built a great car company...

00:23.451 --> 00:26.357
...and somewhere along the way, you know, about five or six years ago,...

00:26.768 --> 00:29.075
...what I thought he was building was an energy company...

00:29.205 --> 00:32.472
...and that eventually people would realize that climate change actually mattered.

00:32.877 --> 00:36.745
And it's taken five or six years for everybody to realize the same thing...

00:37.095 --> 00:38.251
...and he's being rewarded.

00:38.403 --> 00:41.469
You know, the world's richest person should be somebody...

00:41.548 --> 00:43.892
...that's fixing and fighting climate change.

00:44.907 --> 00:47.916
I think the reality is that Tesla is a distributed energy business.

00:48.323 --> 00:48.446
Right?

00:48.553 --> 00:52.543
They are figuring out how to harness energy, how to store it...

00:52.875 --> 00:56.869
...and then how to use it in a way to allow humans to be productive.

00:57.091 --> 01:00.757
Cars are a manifestation, but you know, solar panels are as well.

01:01.016 --> 01:02.412
Power walls are as well.

01:02.764 --> 01:04.620
And I'm telling you right now, Scott,...

01:04.969 --> 01:09.348
...the big disruption that's coming is to power utilities.
