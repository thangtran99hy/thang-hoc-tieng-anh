The pandemic has already left businesses like Peter's up to 40 percent down.

00:04.088 --> 00:07.001
There's going to be an impact as in there's going to be a cost involved.

00:07.252 --> 00:11.352
And obviously and unfortunately, that cost is going to be handed on to the consumer.

00:11.877 --> 00:16.441
Because obviously with the extra paperwork and the extra time at the ports.

00:16.757 --> 00:18.154
I did vote for Brexit.

00:19.154 --> 00:22.609
But, I think if I had my time again, I don't know.

00:23.482 --> 00:24.714
Oh really? As serious as that?

00:25.114 --> 00:25.274
Yeah.

00:25.757 --> 00:27.130
Because of the impact on your business?

00:27.201 --> 00:28.025
Because of the impact, yeah.

00:28.586 --> 00:29.931
But, there's optimism here, too.

00:30.089 --> 00:34.188
Steven's a fifth generation fish trader and says any problems are small fry.

00:34.583 --> 00:39.695
Short term, there may be a couple of weeks where suppliers are maybe just a little bit nervous.

00:39.973 --> 00:42.250
But long term, I'm very optimistic.

00:42.344 --> 00:45.761
I believe it's a huge opportunity for this country as a whole.

00:45.845 --> 00:46.509
I really do.
