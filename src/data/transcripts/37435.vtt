Welcome to Anjo City in Japan.

00:04.520 --> 00:08.451
Home to a small establishment with not so small dishes.

00:09.205 --> 00:12.761
Hiromu has been making sushi here for 44 years.

00:13.955 --> 00:17.052
One day, a drunk customer challenged Hiromu...

00:17.157 --> 00:19.489
...to make the biggest sushi roll he could,...

00:19.946 --> 00:22.819
...so he whipped up the seaweed and delivered.

00:28.247 --> 00:31.985
Hiromu made several infamous giant sushi dishes.

00:32.619 --> 00:34.217
Big sushi means big money.

00:34.475 --> 00:38.434
Hiromu's generous roll costs 146 US dollars.
