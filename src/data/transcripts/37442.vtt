My fellow Americans, four years ago,...

00:02.884 --> 00:06.735
...we launched a great national effort to rebuild our country,...

00:07.213 --> 00:13.126
...to renew its spirit, and to restore the allegiance of this government to its citizens.

00:13.545 --> 00:20.535
In short, we embarked on a mission to make America great again for all Americans.

00:21.110 --> 00:25.901
As I conclude my term as the 45th President of the United States,...

00:26.295 --> 00:30.205
...I stand before you truly proud of what we have achieved together.

00:31.307 --> 00:37.089
We did what we came here to do and so much more.

00:37.583 --> 00:41.530
This week, we inaugurate a new administration...

00:41.953 --> 00:46.483
...and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous.

00:47.186 --> 00:54.401
We extend our best wishes, and we also want them to have luck, a very important word.

00:55.265 --> 00:57.573
Most of all, I want to thank the American people.

00:57.985 --> 01:02.470
To serve as your president has been an honor beyond description.

01:02.993 --> 01:06.160
Thank you for this extraordinary privilege.

01:06.253 --> 01:09.295
And that's what it is, a great privilege and a great honor.

01:10.049 --> 01:14.473
We must never forget that while Americans will always have our disagreements,...

01:15.060 --> 01:19.389
...we are a nation of incredible, decent, faithful, and peace-loving citizens...

01:19.876 --> 01:23.469
...who all want our country to thrive and flourish...

01:23.745 --> 01:26.489
...and be very, very successful and good.

01:27.278 --> 01:29.780
We are a truly magnificent nation.

01:30.112 --> 01:33.627
All Americans were horrified by the assault on our Capitol.

01:34.265 --> 01:38.423
Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans.

01:38.808 --> 01:40.388
It can never be tolerated.

01:40.827 --> 01:41.720
Now more than ever,...

01:41.797 --> 01:46.650
...we must unify around our shared values and rise above the partisan rancor,..

01:46.721 --> 01:48.903
...and forge our common destiny.

01:49.775 --> 01:56.039
Four years ago, I came to Washington as the only true outsider ever to win the presidency.
