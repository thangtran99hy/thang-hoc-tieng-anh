00:00.183 --> 00:02.650
This is America's day.

00:03.842 --> 00:05.771
This is democracy's day.

00:06.626 --> 00:10.649
A day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve.

00:11.763 --> 00:13.883
Through a crucible for the ages,...

00:13.978 --> 00:18.865
...America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge.

00:19.853 --> 00:23.849
Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate...

00:24.313 --> 00:27.683
...but of a cause, the cause of democracy.

00:28.601 --> 00:32.595
The people, the will of the people, has been heard,...

00:33.210 --> 00:35.651
...and the will of the people has been heeded.

00:36.458 --> 00:40.271
We've learned again that democracy is precious,...

00:41.033 --> 00:47.511
...democracy is fragile, and at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.

00:53.487 --> 00:56.669
On this hallowed ground where just a few days ago...

00:57.320 --> 01:00.568
...violence sought to shake the Capitol's very foundation,...

01:01.409 --> 01:06.299
...we come together as one nation under God, indivisible,...

01:06.914 --> 01:10.077
...to carry out the peaceful transfer of power...

01:10.608 --> 01:13.005
...as we have for more than two centuries.

01:14.155 --> 01:21.981
As we look ahead in our uniquely American way, restless, bold, optimistic,...

01:22.831 --> 01:27.571
...and set our sights on a nation we know we can be and we must be,...

01:29.128 --> 01:33.415
...I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here today.

01:34.255 --> 01:36.141
I thank them from the bottom of my heart.

01:36.914 --> 01:47.371
And I know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength,...

01:48.080 --> 01:49.609
...the strength of our nation.
