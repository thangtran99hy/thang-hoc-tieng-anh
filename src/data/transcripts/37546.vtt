00:00.050 --> 00:01.694
This is a special moment for General Motors...

00:01.809 --> 00:04.822
...as we reimagine the future of personal transportation...

00:05.251 --> 00:06.905
...for the next five years and beyond.

00:07.419 --> 00:11.066
Leveraging technology to create a consistent GM brand promise.

00:11.311 --> 00:16.121
Vertical take-off and landing drone or VTOL is GM's first foray into aerial mobility.

00:16.721 --> 00:20.623
We are preparing for a world where advances in electric and autonomous technology...

00:20.717 --> 00:22.555
...make personal air travel possible...

00:23.379 --> 00:26.917
It is a concept designed for the moment when time is of essence...

00:27.763 --> 00:28.889
...and convenience is everything.

00:29.907 --> 00:33.077
You've been at the office, and now you need to get to a meeting across town.

00:33.712 --> 00:38.244
The VTOL meets you on the roof and drops you at the vertiport closest to your destination.

00:38.936 --> 00:42.250
It uses a 90-kWh EV motor to power four rotors...

00:42.665 --> 00:45.525
...as well as air-to-air and air-to-ground communications.

00:46.444 --> 00:49.180
As a passenger, it represents personal space...

00:49.559 --> 00:52.147
...and a panoramic view of the world passing beneath you.

00:52.505 --> 00:56.018
And it's a glimpse of what autonomy and Cadillac luxury might look like...

00:56.097 --> 00:57.405
...in the not too distant future.

00:58.611 --> 00:59.829
We have other concepts coming...

00:59.973 --> 01:03.531
...including a luxurious two-seater designed for you and someone very special...

01:04.113 --> 01:07.716
...to decompress, relax and enjoy a multisensory experience...

01:08.081 --> 01:10.073
...choreographed for more intimate journeys.

01:10.856 --> 01:13.809
Each concept reflecting the needs and wants of the passengers...

01:14.158 --> 01:15.780
...at a particular moment in time...

01:16.277 --> 01:18.951
...and GM's vision of the future of transportation.
