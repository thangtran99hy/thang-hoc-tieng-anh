Move over, Lady Gaga and J.Lo.

00:04.115 --> 00:08.265
At Wednesday's star-studded inauguration, US Senator Bernie Sanders...

00:08.385 --> 00:12.712
...somehow managed to steal the spotlight with his supersized mittens.

00:12.985 --> 00:18.030
This photo of Sanders cutting a curmudgeonly figure in his grandpa chic mittens,...

00:18.254 --> 00:20.907
...sent the internet into a meme frenzy.

00:21.417 --> 00:24.931
Sanders has been spliced atop the throne from Game of Thrones,...

00:25.513 --> 00:28.560
...seated next to Forrest Gump on that famous bench,...

00:28.850 --> 00:32.273
...even placed high above New York City in the legendary photo...

00:32.385 --> 00:34.252
..."Lunch Atop a Skyscraper."

00:34.682 --> 00:39.455
Sanders told CBS News, his viral attire was merely a practical decision.

00:39.668 --> 00:45.433
You know, in Vermont, we dress warm. We know something about the cold.

00:46.355 --> 00:49.383
We're not so concerned about good fashion. We wanna keep warm.

00:49.885 --> 00:52.023
And that's what I did today.

00:52.438 --> 00:55.780
The mittens that stole the show were made by teacher Jen Ellis...

00:55.975 --> 00:58.160
...from Sanders' home state of Vermont.

00:58.451 --> 01:01.267
She gifted them to Sanders over two years ago.

01:01.706 --> 01:05.408
But sorry, you can't get your hands on them anytime soon.

01:05.786 --> 01:09.417
Because the pandemic has forced the cancellation of craft fairs,...

01:09.703 --> 01:12.509
...Ellis hasn't been knitting mittens for sale lately.

01:12.989 --> 01:13.997
Exclusivity.

01:14.189 --> 01:14.951
How chic.
