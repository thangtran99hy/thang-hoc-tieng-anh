Well, I think the fact that the three of us are standing here...

00:03.161 --> 00:05.521
...talking about a peaceful transfer of power...

00:05.605 --> 00:09.037
...speaks to the institutional integrity of our country.

00:09.449 --> 00:10.943
So, this is an unusual thing.

00:11.029 --> 00:14.657
We are both trying to come back to normalcy,...

00:15.183 --> 00:19.980
...deal with totally abnormal challenges, and do what we do best,...

00:20.061 --> 00:21.873
...which is try to make a more perfect union.

00:21.957 --> 00:23.179
That's an exciting time.

00:23.423 --> 00:28.349
We've got to not just listen to folks we agree with, but listen to folks we don't.

00:29.341 --> 00:32.123
And one of my fondest memories of the inauguration...

00:32.200 --> 00:37.618
...was the grace and generosity that President Bush showed me...

00:37.733 --> 00:39.438
...and Laura Bush showed Michelle.

00:39.529 --> 00:44.763
And it was a reminder that we can have fierce disagreements...

00:45.484 --> 00:49.335
...and yet recognize each other's common humanity...

00:49.525 --> 00:55.853
...and that, as Americans, we have more in common than what separates us.

00:56.283 --> 00:59.437
I think if Americans would love their neighbor...

00:59.527 --> 01:01.697
...like they would love to be loved themselves,...

01:02.113 --> 01:05.469
...a lot of the division in our society would end.
