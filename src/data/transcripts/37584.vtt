Monoliths have been popping up in various places this year.

00:03.285 --> 00:05.683
And now, one has appeared to celebrate the holidays.

00:05.992 --> 00:11.546
This monolith appeared in San Francisco and it's made entirely out of gingerbread.

00:11.829 --> 00:16.206
You can see it's several feet tall and decorated with icing and candy.

00:16.539 --> 00:18.937
Visitors stop by to get a glimpse of the sculpture...

00:19.020 --> 00:21.365
...and take in the sweet gingerbread smell.

00:21.492 --> 00:22.258
Oh, I love that.

00:22.343 --> 00:23.911
I love the smell of gingerbread.

00:24.119 --> 00:25.210
Oh my goodness.
