Renowned for steep ski movie worthy lines and epic views of the Swiss Alps,...

00:06.401 --> 00:10.251
...Verbier is a paradise for adventurous skiers and riders.

00:10.603 --> 00:12.217
Oh, and cheese lovers.

00:12.854 --> 00:15.419
As the world's top freeride destination,...

00:15.513 --> 00:18.993
...Verbier has tremendous skiing and I couldn't wait to explore it.

00:19.343 --> 00:23.783
I was lucky enough to be guided around by local pro snowboarder Geraldine Fasnacht.

00:24.233 --> 00:27.929
To access the best lines, we did a lot of hiking to secret stashes...

00:28.034 --> 00:30.477
...and it was 100% worth the effort.

00:37.361 --> 00:39.493
Now, let's talk about the views.

00:39.803 --> 00:41.695
The Swiss Alps are mind-blowing...

00:41.824 --> 00:45.345
...and Verbier provides incredible opportunities to take it all in.

00:45.671 --> 00:46.641
For the best views,...

00:46.745 --> 00:52.330
...it's key to take the tram to the ski area's 10,918-foot summit, Mont Fort.

00:53.065 --> 00:56.283
From here, you can see the backside of the legendary Matterhorn...

00:56.370 --> 00:58.529
...and even as far as Mont Blanc.

01:00.948 --> 01:02.962
On top of skiing and the views,...

01:03.043 --> 01:05.993
...this wouldn't be Switzerland if we didn't talk about the cheese.

01:06.428 --> 01:10.867
Alpine fair classics like fondue and raclette originated in the Swiss Alps...

01:10.939 --> 01:14.416
...so you can bet I was swimming in cheese after a big day of skiing in Verbier.

01:14.935 --> 01:18.959
Definitely check out Le Caveau, a popular raclette joint in the heart of the village.

01:21.417 --> 01:24.427
The owner and cheesemakers have many stories to tell...

01:24.591 --> 01:28.224
...and it's a great experience for those looking to enjoy more Swiss culture.
