With this movie, with Wonder Woman 1984,...

00:06.059 --> 00:12.003
...we were already feeling like we were heading into some dark place as humanity...

00:12.175 --> 00:15.282
...and where the world was going to,...

00:16.085 --> 00:24.084
...and we wanted to reflect on that as human and show what we would like the world to be...

00:25.900 --> 00:28.246
...and that was something that we tried to do in this movie.

00:28.349 --> 00:30.228
And this movie is all about the truth...

00:30.798 --> 00:34.775
...and being able to accept the truth as it is,...

00:35.311 --> 00:37.985
...and it's all about hope and love.

00:38.157 --> 00:46.610
Because of the way the movie was received, the first one, and the impact that it had,...

00:47.109 --> 00:50.499
...we both knew that we got to up our game even more...

00:50.961 --> 00:53.057
...and the bar was just super high.

00:53.159 --> 00:57.115
So, the movie is just very ambitious.

00:57.243 --> 00:59.125
The scope is huge.

01:00.469 --> 01:05.370
As far as storytelling, we have four different storylines.

01:06.131 --> 01:09.321
As far as the action goes, it was beyond...

01:09.425 --> 01:14.031
...and Patty really made a point about wanting a minimal amount of CGI...

01:14.145 --> 01:16.726
...and just really had to do so much of it by ourselves.

01:17.117 --> 01:19.896
So, it was a lot.
