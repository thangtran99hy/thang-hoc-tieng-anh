The ultimate sweetest thing you can do for someone...

00:02.686 --> 00:05.252
...is to present them with a hearty breakfast in bed.

00:05.711 --> 00:07.418
Imagine how happy your partner will be...

00:07.510 --> 00:10.887
...if you whip up a plate of heart-shaped red velvet cakes,...

00:11.255 --> 00:14.119
...waffles, cookies and toast when he or she wakes up.

00:14.655 --> 00:16.613
Well, the pandemic has been quite long...

00:16.708 --> 00:19.969
...and we are pretty sure that there are a lot of upgrades...

00:20.087 --> 00:22.637
...that you might want to do to your room or your house.

00:22.795 --> 00:26.684
Bring in some paint cans, put out some music or the stereo...

00:26.857 --> 00:28.757
...and have a great bonding time with your partner....

00:28.833 --> 00:31.003
...as you both work on your ideas together.

00:31.187 --> 00:32.745
We know that you all love to go out...

00:32.830 --> 00:35.992
...and catch a romantic comedy on the screens on this day...

00:36.068 --> 00:37.721
...but hey, pandemic alert.

00:38.089 --> 00:40.465
But how about making your own home theater?

00:40.627 --> 00:43.287
You can put out some popcorn, prop up some cushions...
