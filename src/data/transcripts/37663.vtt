Hi everyone.

00:03.219 --> 00:06.139
My name is Yusei Kikuchi of the Seattle Mariners.

00:07.157 --> 00:08.361
I am very happy to be here.

00:09.499 --> 00:13.095
Today is a very special day for my family and I.

00:14.853 --> 00:21.884
Thank you for my family and amazing wife, Rumi, my friends, my high school coach,...

00:22.483 --> 00:26.797
...and my mentor, Mr. Sasaki for  supporting me everyday.

00:28.305 --> 00:31.053
Playing in the big league has been a dream of mine...

00:31.675 --> 00:33.217
...since I was 15 years old.

00:34.469 --> 00:38.346
Thank you, Seibu Lions for letting me go on and live my dream.

00:42.748 --> 00:51.118
Mariners ownership and Mr. Dipoto and Mr. Servais...

00:53.457 --> 00:54.655
...thank you for this new journey.

00:56.937 --> 01:01.105
And to my new teammates, I can't wait to meet you guys soon.

01:01.654 --> 01:02.183
Thank you.

01:08.035 --> 01:12.180
I feel this team really needed me the most.

01:12.774 --> 01:15.506
And I feel chemistry between us.

01:22.714 --> 01:23.760
Ah, yeah.

01:25.551 --> 01:31.479
I don't know the details yet but I want to practice hard and adjust myself.

01:31.941 --> 01:36.307
And I want to enjoy every single thing.

01:42.765 --> 01:47.067
My strong points is fastball and slider.

01:48.027 --> 01:50.741
And yeah.

01:59.813 --> 02:01.707
I watched Wikipedia...

02:02.463 --> 02:07.978
...and I hear there are enthusiastic fans here in Seattle.

02:10.906 --> 02:12.357
And it is a beautiful city.
