00:01.372 --> 00:06.938
At just ten years old, Japan's Kyuta Kumagai is already a world champion sumo wrestler.

00:07.469 --> 00:09.197
He weighs 85 kilograms,...

00:09.299 --> 00:14.117
...eats as much as 4,000 calories a day and beats boys five and six years older than him.

00:14.458 --> 00:17.837
Kumagai trains six days a week at a local temple lifting weights...

00:17.915 --> 00:19.560
...and working on his flexibility.

00:20.513 --> 00:23.103
It often leaves him breathless, bloody and crying.

00:23.536 --> 00:26.381
His dad, Taisuke, entered his son in his first tournament...

00:26.456 --> 00:28.371
...when Kyuta was just in kindergarten.

00:29.534 --> 00:34.367
Taisuke Kumagai moved his family to a part of Tokyo famous for producing sumo wrestlers.

00:34.871 --> 00:39.008
Now, Kyuta trains with former professional sumo wrestler Shinichi Taira.
