I'm so excited!

00:07.261 --> 00:09.069
It's almost Valentine's Day!

00:10.743 --> 00:14.099
Valentine's Day is celebrated on February 14th.

00:14.651 --> 00:18.316
For many people, it is the most romantic day of the year.

00:19.195 --> 00:24.409
People often give flowers, cards, jewelry, and of course, chocolate.

00:25.381 --> 00:27.931
Couples often go out for a romantic dinner.

00:29.413 --> 00:34.024
In North America, Valentine's Day is celebrated from a very young age.

00:36.024 --> 00:38.856
Children often make homemade Valentine's Day cards.

00:41.159 --> 00:46.496
They use crayons, colored paper, scissors, glue and many other things.

00:48.482 --> 00:51.899
After making the card, they write a personal message on it...

00:52.949 --> 00:54.973
...and then they exchange them with each other.

00:59.691 --> 01:02.644
Children also exchange and eat lots of chocolate.

01:03.700 --> 01:06.251
Hershey's Kisses are especially popular.

01:07.913 --> 01:09.597
Will you be my Valentine?
