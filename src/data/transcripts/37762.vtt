00:00.868 --> 00:04.463
Regaining pole position as the world's top selling automaker...

00:04.559 --> 00:06.501
...for the first time in five years.

00:06.708 --> 00:11.723
Japan's Toyota Motor overtook Germany's Volkswagen in vehicle sales last year...

00:11.840 --> 00:16.165
...as the global health crisis demand slump hit its German rival harder.

00:16.537 --> 00:19.820
Toyota said on Thursday its group-wide global sales...

00:19.934 --> 00:24.828
...fell 11.3 percent to 9.5 million vehicles in 2020.

00:25.035 --> 00:28.324
That was compared with around a 15 percent drop at Volkswagen.

00:29.045 --> 00:33.527
Automakers have suffered as lockdowns have stopped people visiting car showrooms...

00:33.824 --> 00:37.275
...and forced manufacturing plants to reduce or halt production.

00:37.870 --> 00:40.387
Toyota, however, has weathered the pandemic better.

00:40.725 --> 00:45.178
That's partly thanks to its home market, Japan and the Asian region in general,...

00:45.450 --> 00:49.346
...which has been less affected by the outbreaks in Europe and the United States.

00:49.631 --> 00:52.420
As demand for cars rebounds particularly in China,...

00:52.579 --> 00:55.779
...Toyota, Volkswagen and other manufacturers are scrambling...

00:55.885 --> 00:58.050
...to tap growing demand for electric cars.

00:58.213 --> 01:02.857
Toyota said that 23 percent of total sales last year were electric vehicles...

01:03.008 --> 01:05.667
...up from 20 percent in 2019.
