So, why do we celebrate Valentine's Day and how did it start?

00:04.365 --> 00:08.007
It's believed that Valentine's Day was started in Rome...

00:08.181 --> 00:10.918
...during the reign of Emperor Claudius II.

00:11.427 --> 00:13.838
Claudius made weddings against the law.

00:14.327 --> 00:20.035
Believing this was unjust, a defiant Roman priest named Bishop Valentine,...

00:20.578 --> 00:23.190
...would secretly marry couples in his church.

00:23.699 --> 00:26.993
Claudius found out, and Valentine was sent to jail.

00:27.362 --> 00:31.677
His execution was set for February 14th.

00:32.286 --> 00:38.118
The jailer's daughter would bring Valentine his food, and soon, they fell in love.

00:38.551 --> 00:40.111
The night before his death,...

00:40.618 --> 00:43.694
...Valentine wrote the jailer's daughter a love letter...

00:44.291 --> 00:47.209
...and he signed it, "Your Valentine."

00:47.383 --> 00:51.885
Ever since, February 14th has been a day that we celebrate love,...

00:52.127 --> 00:57.093
...and we show the people in our lives just how much we adore and appreciate them.
