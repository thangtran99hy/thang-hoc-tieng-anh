00:08.867 --> 00:10.612
There's a chapel in Kansas,...

00:11.880 --> 00:15.267
...standing on the exact center of the lower forty-eight.

00:16.321 --> 00:17.788
It never closes.

00:18.507 --> 00:20.261
All are more than welcome...

00:21.235 --> 00:24.065
...to come meet here, in the middle.

00:25.253 --> 00:26.442
It's no secret.

00:26.901 --> 00:29.947
The middle has been a hard place to get to lately.

00:30.229 --> 00:32.253
Between red and blue.

00:32.731 --> 00:35.097
Between servant and citizen.

00:35.999 --> 00:39.147
Between our freedom and our fear.

00:40.287 --> 00:44.075
Now, fear has never been the best of who we are.

00:44.593 --> 00:49.249
And as for freedom, it's not the property of just the fortunate few;...

00:49.535 --> 00:51.467
...it belongs to us all.

00:52.642 --> 00:55.688
Whoever you are, wherever you're from...

00:57.203 --> 00:58.732
...it's what connects us.

00:59.344 --> 01:00.973
And we need that connection.

01:01.951 --> 01:03.635
We need the middle.

01:05.066 --> 01:10.836
We just have to remember the very soil we stand on is common ground,...

01:12.093 --> 01:13.219
...so we can get there.

01:14.779 --> 01:18.693
We can make it to the mountaintop, through the desert,...

01:20.042 --> 01:22.593
...and we will cross this divide.

01:23.973 --> 01:28.875
Our light has always found its way through the darkness.

01:30.431 --> 01:36.233
And there's hope on the road up ahead.
