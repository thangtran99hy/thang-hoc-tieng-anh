The global health crisis has caused unemployment to soar...

00:03.471 --> 00:05.672
...and has turned the working world on its head,...

00:05.967 --> 00:10.917
...but some say the solution to the crisis lies not in working more but in working less.

00:11.200 --> 00:14.903
Working four days but getting paid for five sounds too good to be true,...

00:15.380 --> 00:17.157
...and there's a fair share of skeptics.

00:17.833 --> 00:23.041
The Confederation of British Industry cautions that it could push many businesses into loss,...

00:23.657 --> 00:27.324
...but proponents claim fewer hours doesn't harm productivity.

00:27.821 --> 00:31.300
There are three main ways which we can see that decreasing hours...

00:31.814 --> 00:33.619
...is good for productivity and good for the economy.

00:33.882 --> 00:38.227
We can look at our own history to see that when we move from a six to a five-day working week,...

00:39.060 --> 00:40.779
...it was accompanied by an increase in productivity...

00:40.881 --> 00:42.609
...and it was good for the economy overall.

00:43.113 --> 00:46.355
You can also look at other countries and take a map for our analysis...

00:46.477 --> 00:49.006
...and we can see that countries that worked fewer hours...

00:49.287 --> 00:50.851
...tend to have much stronger economies...

00:50.953 --> 00:53.088
...and tend to be much more productive than countries that work lots of hours.

00:54.809 --> 00:57.908
And finally, we can see real and existing examples of...

00:58.193 --> 01:02.562
...firms and organizations who are experimenting with reductions in working hours.

01:02.869 --> 01:04.852
They are doing this and seeing the increases...

01:04.963 --> 01:08.442
...in terms of increased well-being, decreased sick leave, decreased turnover...

01:08.692 --> 01:12.037
...and it's clearly good for these organizations that they have reduced working time.
