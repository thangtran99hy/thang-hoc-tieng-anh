00:11.278 --> 00:13.257
The bell has been rung.

00:19.247 --> 00:23.553
Out in the dark, among the stars.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.234
The god is dead.

00:33.898 --> 00:34.825
I had a dream,...

00:37.791 --> 00:39.127
...almost like a premonition,...

00:42.821 --> 00:43.885
...that there is an attack coming.

00:45.419 --> 00:46.320
My lord.

00:47.262 --> 00:48.501
This world will fall.

00:52.418 --> 00:53.705
I need warriors.

00:54.903 --> 00:58.281
I'm building an alliance to defend ourselves.

01:00.492 --> 01:01.949
How do you know your team is strong enough?

01:03.371 --> 01:05.503
If you can't bring down the charging bull,...

01:05.767 --> 01:07.721
...then don't wave the red cape at it.

01:13.749 --> 01:15.144
You were sent here for a reason.

01:18.089 --> 01:20.237
And even if it takes you the rest of your life,...

01:23.067 --> 01:24.719
...find out what that reason is.

01:37.822 --> 01:40.096
You said the age of heroes would never come again.

01:46.785 --> 01:47.459
It will.

01:49.134 --> 01:49.986
It has to.

01:55.405 --> 02:01.500
We live in a society where honor is a distant memory.

02:02.621 --> 02:03.464
Isn't that right,...

02:05.707 --> 02:06.488
...Batman?
