There were so many cool moments this summer and I want to share them with you.

00:06.022 --> 00:08.349
I had several amazing trips.

00:08.710 --> 00:12.357
The longest one took me 18 hours.

00:12.803 --> 00:20.442
I went from the US to Ukraine to a city called Odessa which is located by the Black Sea.

00:20.665 --> 00:24.046
Almost every day, I would ride my bike to the beach.

00:24.415 --> 00:29.404
And I definitely enjoyed lots of swimming with my friends and cousins.

00:35.809 --> 00:42.086
And I loved the boat trip that we took with my family along the seashore of Odessa.

00:42.545 --> 00:47.209
It was fun to see dolphins fooling around in the dolphinarium.

00:47.510 --> 00:49.139
It was a cool show.

00:49.480 --> 00:53.283
Once I even had the chance to swim with dolphins.

00:53.516 --> 00:55.005
It was really fun.

01:01.809 --> 01:04.315
This summer, I even got to be a chef!

01:04.808 --> 01:06.681
I made a yummy pizza.

01:06.948 --> 01:08.427
My cousins did, too.

01:09.300 --> 01:14.302
By the way, did you know that the first pizza in the world was made in Greece.

01:15.631 --> 01:18.791
I had a few train trips around Ukraine.

01:19.123 --> 01:22.742
Me and my family got to go to the Carpathian mountain.

01:22.987 --> 01:25.347
It was super beautiful and fun.

01:25.625 --> 01:28.173
Look at these gigantic trees.

01:28.333 --> 01:32.962
My cousin and I look so tiny comparing to them.
