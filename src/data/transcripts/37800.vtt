So, when did homework become the never-ending nightly nightmare we know it as today?

00:05.949 --> 00:09.037
It was in the 1950s that things started to change,...

00:09.133 --> 00:11.937
...and homework finally reared its ugly head.

00:12.150 --> 00:15.619
At the time, the US was competing with the Soviet Union...

00:15.754 --> 00:18.762
...and tried to get any competitive edge they could find.

00:19.052 --> 00:23.331
One of the ways they wanted to get the upper hand was by raising smarter kids.

00:23.608 --> 00:27.240
Teachers and school districts were encouraged to assign more homework...

00:27.438 --> 00:30.898
...so that American students would outcompete their Soviet counterparts...

00:31.005 --> 00:33.855
...and grow up to be scientists and engineers,...

00:34.072 --> 00:39.290
...and by the 1950s, less families needed their kids to stay at home and work the fields.

00:39.518 --> 00:44.205
So, there wasn't a huge outcry from parents once the assignments started rolling in.
