00:00.050 --> 00:01.819
The UK is seeking trade deals...

00:01.917 --> 00:05.642
...with new friends further afield in the Asia Pacific region.

00:06.689 --> 00:10.911
The CPTPP covers a market of 500 million people...

00:11.270 --> 00:14.362
...from Australia and Japan to Chile and Mexico,...

00:14.691 --> 00:19.935
...countries around the Pacific Rim generating more than 13 percent of the world's income.

00:20.706 --> 00:23.764
The immediate benefits to the UK might be limited.

00:24.031 --> 00:28.917
CPTPP nations account for less than 10 percent of UK exports.

00:29.202 --> 00:34.137
That's dwarfed by the massive 43 percent of UK exports going to the EU.

00:34.718 --> 00:38.557
But longer term, the UK hopes to build stronger ties with nations...

00:38.884 --> 00:41.719
...who provide UK manufacturers with components.

00:42.126 --> 00:46.419
Tariffs would be cut on UK exports of food, drink and cars.

00:46.888 --> 00:49.730
There would also be faster visas for business travel.

00:50.087 --> 00:54.161
The UK will be the first country to join which wasn't there at the start.

00:54.509 --> 00:59.443
And if all goes to plan, will be the group's second largest economy after Japan.

01:00.396 --> 01:01.925
And the icing on the cake,...

01:02.053 --> 01:06.014
...it may be a way of getting a warmer trade relationship with the US.

01:06.387 --> 01:09.742
President Joe Biden has hinted at joining the partnership.
