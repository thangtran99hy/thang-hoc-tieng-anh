In 1919, the Ford Motor Company opened its first assembly plant in Brazil.

00:05.699 --> 00:07.237
More than 100 years later,...

00:07.329 --> 00:10.109
...it announced the closure of their last three plants in the country...

00:10.356 --> 00:13.898
...following the Sao Bernardo do Campo plant closure in 2019...

00:14.077 --> 00:16.167
...in the industrial outskirts of Sao Paolo.

00:16.307 --> 00:18.417
About 5,000 jobs will be cut.

00:19.072 --> 00:22.713
In this video, these workers from the Taubate plant in Sao Paolo's countryside,...

00:22.910 --> 00:24.111
...are protesting the closure.

00:24.403 --> 00:25.587
Ford said in a statement...

00:25.672 --> 00:28.891
...that it's reorganizing its production structure in South America...

00:29.030 --> 00:31.831
...to increase margins and generate more cash flow.

00:32.029 --> 00:34.879
The automaker's dealerships will continue to operate in Brazil,...

00:35.125 --> 00:36.918
...selling cars brought from other countries,...

00:37.021 --> 00:40.859
...mostly Argentina and Uruguay and offering services to customers.

00:41.199 --> 00:45.930
The Sao Bernardo plant closed down in October 2019 after 52 years....

00:46.113 --> 00:48.687
...and at a time when Ford only spoke of their intention...

00:48.759 --> 00:51.138
...to stop production of trucks in the country.

00:51.482 --> 00:54.287
Ford's plant closures in Brazil have to do with the crisis...

00:54.389 --> 00:56.224
...caused by the COVID-19 pandemic...

00:56.552 --> 01:00.622
...but also reflect changes in the global production and flow of cars.
