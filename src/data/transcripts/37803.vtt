00:01.565 --> 00:02.701
No one wants to be bullied.

00:03.371 --> 00:06.401
Everyone wants to feel like they mean something to somebody.

00:06.727 --> 00:09.413
It's definitely a hard four years of your life, you know.

00:09.797 --> 00:13.650
Even a few words can affect someone so negatively.

00:15.882 --> 00:19.059
Opening a door is more than a physical act.

00:19.359 --> 00:21.017
It's like putting yourself out there,...

00:21.845 --> 00:24.808
...getting to know people, make them feel comfortable,...

00:25.399 --> 00:26.523
...make them feel welcome.

00:28.681 --> 00:32.626
Opening doors, it gives people hope that people care.

00:33.494 --> 00:37.160
I  personally think that you shouldn't let what's going on around you...

00:37.276 --> 00:40.295
...affect your personality or the way you act.

00:40.624 --> 00:41.492
Be courageous.

00:43.430 --> 00:45.129
Don't let the bullies get you down.

00:45.206 --> 00:48.179
Just fight back in your own way...

00:48.921 --> 00:50.275
...maybe with a little kindness.
