According to the Entertainment Software Association of Canada,...

00:03.413 --> 00:07.480
...sales are up 25 percent mostly due to online purchases.

00:07.744 --> 00:12.036
And that's already translating into more jobs for programmers and digital artists.

00:12.135 --> 00:15.819
I mean in Nova Scotia, I believe there's upwards of 30 openings right now...

00:15.928 --> 00:18.231
...in an industry that employs about 300 people.

00:19.351 --> 00:23.817
In Quebec, there is about 2000 job openings right now...

00:23.893 --> 00:26.160
...in an industry that employs 13,000 people.

00:26.537 --> 00:31.749
And this is in the middle of what is the worst economic situation in 75 years.

00:31.965 --> 00:35.335
The gaming industry has also had to adjust to remote work.

00:35.451 --> 00:37.706
But, don't let the empty studio fool you.

00:37.911 --> 00:41.367
This gaming company is among those hiring due to high sales.

00:41.497 --> 00:43.398
We've brought on about 16 people.

00:43.915 --> 00:47.703
And we're still in the hunt for another four or five.

00:48.293 --> 00:49.994
The question post-pandemic,...

00:50.096 --> 00:53.941
...will be whether people will continue spending so much time playing video games...

00:54.185 --> 00:56.302
...when they can return to other activities.

00:56.567 --> 00:58.263
People will have learned a behavior.

00:58.373 --> 01:02.183
They will have been introduced to games, found an affinity for games...

01:02.283 --> 01:04.353
...or the communities and the friends they they've made.
