00:00.050 --> 00:02.980
A lot of human activities generate greenhouse gases.

00:03.159 --> 00:08.279
Generating electricity, transportation, growing food, heating buildings,...

00:08.508 --> 00:10.937
...and making materials like steel and cement.

00:11.143 --> 00:15.141
If our goal was simply to emit 10 percent less greenhouse gas,...

00:15.425 --> 00:18.522
...you can imagine trying to limit those activities.

00:18.691 --> 00:22.417
But because we need to get to zero emissions by 2050,...

00:22.665 --> 00:25.076
...we have to come up with an alternate way...

00:25.521 --> 00:29.967
...which isn't too much more expensive to perform those same activities...

00:30.123 --> 00:33.479
...without emitting any greenhouse gases.

00:33.649 --> 00:37.057
We can compare the cost per unit of the current way of doing it...

00:37.189 --> 00:39.833
...to the approach that creates no emissions.

00:40.025 --> 00:44.315
So, the actual extra cost, which we call the "green premium,"

00:44.460 --> 00:47.785
...for things like green jet fuel, is very high.

00:48.119 --> 00:52.311
Jet fuel is a good example because there's a significant premium.

00:52.708 --> 00:58.200
In the United States, a gallon of jet fuel averages about two dollars and twenty cents.

00:58.549 --> 01:03.236
One way to go green is instead of taking that oil out of the ground...

01:03.502 --> 01:07.322
...that has carbon from millions of years ago coming up into the atmosphere...

01:07.496 --> 01:13.947
...we can take the oil by generating it from plant material or biowaste or even algae.

01:14.389 --> 01:18.549
Biofuels cost five dollars and thirty-five cents per gallon.

01:18.790 --> 01:24.777
So, that's quite a premium, 5.35 versus 2.20, so three dollars and fifteen cents premium.

01:24.981 --> 01:27.253
More than double the typical price.

01:27.995 --> 01:29.677
The green premium is a tool...

01:29.917 --> 01:35.409
...that gives us a way of looking at how far away we are from making it easy...

01:35.757 --> 01:37.972
...and where this green premium is the highest.

01:38.169 --> 01:42.316
That's where we need to put resources behind solving that particular area.

01:42.663 --> 01:46.689
We need a lot of research and development and a lot of innovative companies...

01:46.846 --> 01:48.779
...to help us get the green premium down.

01:48.871 --> 01:51.059
And if you can get it down close to zero,...

01:51.240 --> 01:56.453
...yes, that will get us to this 2050 goal of zero emissions.
