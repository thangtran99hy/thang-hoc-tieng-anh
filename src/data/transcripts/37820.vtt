00:01.273 --> 00:04.522
Seven months after launching from Florida's Cape Canaveral,...

00:04.943 --> 00:06.617
...NASA's Perseverance Rover..

00:06.714 --> 00:10.243
...completed a space journey of nearly half a billion kilometers...

00:10.329 --> 00:11.699
...to the surface of Mars.

00:12.134 --> 00:16.434
The mission ahead: to search the red planet for signs of ancient life.

00:16.940 --> 00:21.423
For now, NASA's scientists like Lori Glaze are breathing a sigh of relief...

00:21.557 --> 00:23.053
...after the perilous landing.

00:23.241 --> 00:26.909
It is definitely the most dangerous thing we have to do.

00:27.018 --> 00:29.899
And the most challenging thing is entering the Mars atmosphere.

00:30.373 --> 00:31.983
Mars' atmosphere is very thin.

00:32.307 --> 00:34.310
It's about one percent of Earth's atmosphere...

00:34.417 --> 00:37.841
...so it's just enough atmosphere that we get really hot coming in...

00:38.141 --> 00:39.906
...but not enough atmosphere to slow us down,...

00:40.009 --> 00:40.918
...so very challenging.

00:41.876 --> 00:44.735
NASA aimed to park its rover at the Jezero crater...

00:44.838 --> 00:47.472
...that scientists believe was once filled with water,...

00:47.553 --> 00:50.095
...an essential prerequisite for life as we know it.

00:50.663 --> 00:54.362
Perseverance is the biggest vehicle NASA has to rove on Mars.

00:54.603 --> 00:56.799
On board is the helicopter Ingenuity.

00:57.218 --> 00:59.698
Together they will survey the Martian surface....

00:59.783 --> 01:02.391
...and collect samples that could answer an age-old question,...

01:02.723 --> 01:05.367
..."Did life ever exist beyond Earth?"

01:05.999 --> 01:08.785
But that's not all according to NASA's Thomas Zurbuchen.

01:09.378 --> 01:13.428
What's so exciting about this, it's not only the landing and the investigations,...

01:13.515 --> 01:16.682
...which is just search for extinct ancient life...

01:17.353 --> 01:19.470
...from a time where life arose on Earth.

01:19.697 --> 01:22.505
If everything goes exactly like we hope, later in the 20s,...

01:22.705 --> 01:25.859
...we're going to go pick up the samples this vehicle is collecting...

01:26.198 --> 01:30.001
...and bring it back to Earth for the first round-trip to the planet Mars.

01:30.828 --> 01:35.281
Perseverance is scheduled to spend at least one Martian year or two Earth years...
