00:01.765 --> 00:02.851
There's my guy.

00:03.426 --> 00:04.307
Welcome home.

00:04.569 --> 00:06.523
This place is overwhelming.

00:07.074 --> 00:10.955
Dr. Isabel Clemens pioneered brain box simulations,...

00:11.179 --> 00:15.604
...ugly, simulated worlds to generate appreciation for the real world.

00:17.779 --> 00:18.698
I'm glad I caught you.

00:18.869 --> 00:22.068
Word on the street is there have been problems with Isabel's research.

00:24.101 --> 00:25.307
I'm a little disoriented.

00:26.169 --> 00:27.067
You're my guy.

00:27.335 --> 00:27.684
Dad!

00:28.425 --> 00:29.436
Graduation.

00:29.677 --> 00:30.617
I did not forget.

00:30.722 --> 00:32.571
It's been a crazy few days.

00:32.707 --> 00:34.083
I graduated two weeks ago.

00:35.044 --> 00:35.442
Ignore her.

00:35.581 --> 00:36.358
She's not real.

00:36.667 --> 00:37.880
She feels real.

00:39.863 --> 00:40.679
I'm scared.

00:41.458 --> 00:42.789
Your head's not on straight.

00:44.291 --> 00:46.019
It's almost like a trick being played.

00:46.425 --> 00:51.828
One of these days, you're going to have to choose between these worlds.

00:56.087 --> 01:02.798
It's amazing how easy humans can get used to even something spectacular.
