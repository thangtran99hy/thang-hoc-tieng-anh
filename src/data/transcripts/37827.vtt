This morning, one of Hollywood's biggest power couples is calling it quits.

00:05.507 --> 00:10.051
Media mogul Kim Kardashian filing for divorce from her husband Kanye West,...

00:10.409 --> 00:13.365
...being seen without her wedding ring the night before filing.

00:13.620 --> 00:17.293
One day after, Kanye was seen still wearing his wedding band.

00:18.922 --> 00:20.092
The pair is splitting up...

00:20.231 --> 00:24.030
...but reportedly making things as amicable as possible for their children,...

00:24.353 --> 00:27.085
...and now looking to divide a global empire.

00:27.683 --> 00:32.576
The superstar couple began dating in 2012 and had their first child a year later...

00:32.894 --> 00:37.935
...with West proposing using a massive screen at an empty ballpark in San Francisco.

00:41.288 --> 00:44.751
After recent strains on their marriage spilled into public view,...

00:47.393 --> 00:50.487
...their divorce comes after more than a decade in the spotlight,...

00:50.592 --> 00:54.590
...including West's ill-fated campaign for president in 2020.

00:55.064 --> 00:58.075
Through it all, West has remained an entertainment titan.

00:58.241 --> 01:03.182
Album sales have soared and his fashion line is starting a new 10-year deal with GAP.

01:03.487 --> 01:08.508
This as Kardashian shifts her focus to political issues like criminal justice reform.
