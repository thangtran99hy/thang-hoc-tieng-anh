00:00.050 --> 00:03.784
Basically, from training to the game up until the last field, like I said before,...

00:04.376 --> 00:08.441
..I used to call it, he used to call it too, the three Ps.

00:09.493 --> 00:13.950
Play, possession, and position.

00:14.421 --> 00:17.725
And the most important one, as you can see, was position.

00:18.075 --> 00:19.869
You have to stay in your position.

00:19.989 --> 00:23.252
Trust your teammates in order for the ball to come to you.
