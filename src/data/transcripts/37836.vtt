This pup is a wiz with a paintbrush.

00:05.535 --> 00:09.881
Hunter, the Shiba Inu is also known as Pawcasso.

00:10.240 --> 00:11.687
And you can see why.

00:12.462 --> 00:15.281
His owners say they discovered his artistic talents...

00:15.383 --> 00:19.791
...while they were trying to channel his energy into a productive activity.

00:20.457 --> 00:22.238
He really needed a lot of exercise.

00:22.320 --> 00:25.652
He needed a lot of mental stimulation,

00:25.763 --> 00:28.722
So, we did a lot of training and tricks and things like that with him.

00:28.942 --> 00:32.453
Just so that he can stay engaged and not destroy the house.

00:33.264 --> 00:35.515
Denise Lo says she got the idea...

00:35.601 --> 00:39.204
...when she and her husband were looking for artwork for their dining room.

00:39.867 --> 00:44.399
Denise says it took about a week of practice for him to learn how to put brush to paper.

00:44.668 --> 00:47.745
But now that he's got the hang of it, he's unstoppable.

00:48.371 --> 00:50.891
He's not only making art for his own family,...

00:51.333 --> 00:56.227
...he now has his own Etsy shop where his Instagram fans can buy his work.

00:56.644 --> 00:58.762
They go from around 50 dollars a piece.
