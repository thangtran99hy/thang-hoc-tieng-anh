The minute you leave the comfort of your own home,...

00:02.925 --> 00:04.200
...masking is the new normal.

00:04.401 --> 00:09.928
But, it's also becoming a major fashion statement with celebrities like Lady Gaga, J.Lo and Lizzo,...

00:10.192 --> 00:12.831
...who are masking up in everything from glitter to spikes.

00:13.318 --> 00:16.474
But, are these fashionable masks effective against COVID-19?

00:16.577 --> 00:20.073
I picked up a number of masks from street vendors and online retailers...

00:20.255 --> 00:22.456
...and I'm going to test them using a couple of methods...

00:22.556 --> 00:24.887
...scientists use to gauge mask efficiency.

00:25.193 --> 00:28.292
If I can blow out this candle with the mask on, it's leaking too much air.

00:28.935 --> 00:31.781
If this water seeps through the mask, it's leaking too much fluid.

00:32.109 --> 00:34.093
Let's use this blue surgical mask at baseline.

00:34.205 --> 00:37.243
As you can see, it doesn't touch the flame at all.

00:37.707 --> 00:39.674
Water doesn't go through it at all either.

00:40.555 --> 00:45.085
This blue sparkly nylon number passes both tests, and we're off to a great start.

00:45.356 --> 00:47.614
This floral cotton mask, it's pretty thin.,...

00:47.941 --> 00:50.449
...but it passes the candle test and fails the water one.

00:50.946 --> 00:54.214
This pretty in pink lacy one barely passes the flame test,...

00:54.305 --> 00:56.247
...but definitely doesn't pass the water test.

00:56.411 --> 01:01.039
This pretty butterfly nylon polyester blend mask passes the candle test very well,...

01:01.223 --> 01:02.706
...but not so much the water one.

01:03.087 --> 01:05.957
This rainbow mask has a waterproof material on the outside...

01:06.080 --> 01:08.818
...and passes both tests with flying colors.

01:09.290 --> 01:13.224
This leopard gaiter is super thin nylon and barely passes the candle test.

01:13.425 --> 01:14.772
It definitely fails the water one.

01:14.913 --> 01:18.377
This fleece gaiter is pretty thick and passes the flame test.

01:18.545 --> 01:20.317
But once again, not the water one.

01:20.631 --> 01:24.592
So, knowing these findings, should we be picking function over fashion...

01:24.775 --> 01:26.247
...when it comes to choosing a mask?
