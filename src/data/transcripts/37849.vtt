I also asked Gates where he lands on the topic we talk about...

00:02.950 --> 00:04.305
....virtually every day in this program:

00:04.399 --> 00:09.027
Bitcoin, and how he thinks about the cryptocurrency in the context of climate change...

00:09.091 --> 00:13.137
...seeing as how Bitcoin takes enormous amounts of energy to digitally mine.

00:15.135 --> 00:17.053
I don't own Bitcoin.

00:17.131 --> 00:18.614
I'm not short Bitcoin.

00:19.997 --> 00:21.643
So, I've taken a neutral view.

00:22.124 --> 00:29.011
I do think moving money into a more digital form and getting transaction cost down,...

00:29.107 --> 00:33.579
...that's something the Gates Foundation does in developing countries.

00:34.067 --> 00:37.718
But there, we do it so that you can reverse the transactions...

00:37.803 --> 00:41.455
...so you have total visibility of who's doing what,...

00:41.601 --> 00:44.940
...so it's not about tax avoidance or illegal activity.

00:46.033 --> 00:53.615
But, Bitcoin can go up and down just based on the mania or whatever the views are...

00:53.722 --> 00:58.019
...and I don't have a way of predicting how that will progress.
