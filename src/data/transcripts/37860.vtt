I've been alerted to a situation.

00:04.422 --> 00:05.682
It's been happening a lot lately.

00:07.031 --> 00:09.613
People have been seeing those photos on social media...

00:09.977 --> 00:11.751
...and are going to great lengths to copy them.

00:12.173 --> 00:13.830
I mean, you know them.

00:15.927 --> 00:17.585
"Hot tub, back shot."

00:18.314 --> 00:20.867
"Man sits quietly on a rock, contemplating."

00:21.781 --> 00:23.097
"Hotdog legs."

00:23.617 --> 00:27.834
And the classic one in these parts, "The Summit Spreadeagle."

00:29.824 --> 00:31.895
Okay, easy does it, sir.

00:32.107 --> 00:34.787
Lower those arms nice and slow.

00:34.967 --> 00:39.116
Hi guys, I've seen all this before, yeah.

00:39.290 --> 00:40.264
We all have,...

00:41.016 --> 00:41.819
...but this summer,...

00:42.133 --> 00:46.573
...we're clamping down on anyone traveling under the social influence. Okay?

00:46.983 --> 00:48.769
Come on guys, you've had your fun.

00:49.793 --> 00:51.748
Trust me, you're going to absolutely love it.

00:52.525 --> 00:53.925
Okay, hop out you two.

00:54.440 --> 00:56.438
You can consider this a warning, guys.

00:57.405 --> 01:00.085
Enjoy the wineries on those bikes,...

01:00.705 --> 01:02.794
...and don't forget to share something new, okay?

01:03.177 --> 01:05.346
It's just really hard sometimes, you know,...

01:06.282 --> 01:10.514
...because there are so many great other photos to take besides your usual 'Gram' shots.

01:12.099 --> 01:15.217
What you need to do is you need to think outside the square or triangle.
