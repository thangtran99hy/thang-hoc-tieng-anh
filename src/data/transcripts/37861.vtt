00:00.202 --> 00:05.144
We surveyed experts across the country on what they plan on doing post-vaccination.

00:05.561 --> 00:07.687
On travel, the answers were mixed.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.175
Will you get on an airplane?

00:09.446 --> 00:10.233
Not immediately.

00:10.762 --> 00:11.721
Yes, I will.

00:11.830 --> 00:13.201
Now that I've been vaccinated,...

00:13.296 --> 00:16.845
...if I had to travel either for a family emergency or for work, I would.

00:16.991 --> 00:19.293
I would not travel for pleasure at least yet.

00:19.597 --> 00:21.579
The same for heading to a restaurant.

00:21.733 --> 00:22.874
Will you eat indoors?

00:23.061 --> 00:25.447
Yes, I would eat indoors because I'm still protected.

00:25.545 --> 00:27.753
And then I would mask to protect others during ordering.

00:28.125 --> 00:31.968
I do not plan to dine indoors until community rates are lower.

00:32.243 --> 00:33.461
Their hesitation?

00:33.574 --> 00:38.495
While your chance of getting sick when vaccinated is very low, you could still carry it.

00:38.685 --> 00:42.045
While they all say they would avoid mass gathering indoors...

00:42.283 --> 00:46.542
...like concerts and sporting events, they're split on small groups indoors.

00:46.701 --> 00:48.443
Would you gather with friends inside?

00:48.773 --> 00:52.703
I would gather only with vaccinated friends inside and have a dinner party.

00:52.938 --> 00:58.095
No, I would be happy to continue hosting my backyard for small get-togethers.

00:58.313 --> 01:01.950
Even returning to the gym, some more cautious than others.

01:02.175 --> 01:03.149
Would you go to the gym?

01:03.542 --> 01:05.469
I would go to the gym indoors.

01:05.790 --> 01:06.579
In a few months.

01:07.062 --> 01:10.069
If it were partially open with social distancing...

01:10.169 --> 01:13.556
...and masking and good disinfection, probably.

01:13.795 --> 01:18.039
Something many are looking forward to: a haircut while masked.

01:18.209 --> 01:19.513
I would love to get a haircut.

01:19.623 --> 01:23.710
If you look at this, this hair was cut by my 11-year-old daughter.

01:24.046 --> 01:26.086
And one thing they all agree on:

01:26.345 --> 01:27.746
Will you stop wearing a mask?

01:28.417 --> 01:28.693
No.

01:29.262 --> 01:29.609
No.

01:30.104 --> 01:30.688
Absolutely not.

01:30.818 --> 01:32.133
I would not stop wearing a mask.
