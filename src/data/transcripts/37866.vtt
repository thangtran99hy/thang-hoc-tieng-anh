It's been a hundred years since the Spanish Flu, and now, we have COVID-19.

00:04.457 --> 00:10.109
So, will pandemics, diseases that affect nearly every country on Earth, be the new normal?

00:10.264 --> 00:16.563
We live in a cleaner environment, which does not allow pathogens to thrive.

00:16.787 --> 00:21.942
On the other hand, because we are encroaching into new environments,...

00:22.055 --> 00:25.831
...we are opening ourselves to unknown pathogens.

00:26.097 --> 00:29.375
Many scientists and analysts argue that over the last 30 years,...

00:29.507 --> 00:34.961
...humans have created the ideal conditions to make a small outbreak of a virus go global.

00:35.190 --> 00:37.231
It's almost like we've made the perfect storm.

00:37.767 --> 00:38.719
What are the reasons?

00:38.980 --> 00:42.637
Well, we've been travelling more, often moving countries whether by choice or not,...

00:42.779 --> 00:45.053
...and we're sending stuff all around the world too:...

00:45.162 --> 00:47.075
...food, animals, plants, gifts.

00:47.210 --> 00:50.701
Cities and towns are becoming more populated with people living closer together,...

00:50.824 --> 00:53.355
...and we've been clearing land to build more homes,...

00:53.571 --> 00:56.807
...losing forests which are often the source of new medicines and cures.

00:57.553 --> 01:00.970
So, does this mean scientists can tell us when the next pandemic will be?

01:01.239 --> 01:02.123
Well, no.

01:02.327 --> 01:05.680
No one was able to predict the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic...

01:05.792 --> 01:08.685
...because we didn't even know that this virus existed.

01:08.951 --> 01:15.755
Scientists have been saying we need to set up systems to prepare for such eventualities.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.202
Viruses will keep appearing.

01:17.415 --> 01:21.869
The challenge now is for governments to contain any virus that comes into their country...

01:22.013 --> 01:26.054
...and for people to change their habits to reduce the likelihood of disease spreading...

01:26.183 --> 01:29.717
...to stop a pandemic like COVID-19 happening again.
