Let's learn how to use "watch," "see" and "look at."

00:06.689 --> 00:12.885
When we look at something, we direct our eyes in its direction and pay attention to it.

00:14.096 --> 00:15.961
Look at the clouds!

00:17.423 --> 00:20.224
Look at this dress! Isn't it pretty?

00:21.426 --> 00:24.219
They all look at the photo and laugh.

00:25.256 --> 00:29.705
"See" means noticing something using our eyes.

00:31.295 --> 00:34.233
I see Mary at school every day.

00:35.543 --> 00:39.272
Do you see that yellow car? I think it's beautiful.

00:40.317 --> 00:42.786
I see a beautiful garden.

00:44.161 --> 00:51.145
"Watch" means to look at something that is changing or moving for a period of time.

00:52.088 --> 00:55.197
She watches cat videos every day.

00:56.377 --> 00:58.767

I don't have time to watch TV.
