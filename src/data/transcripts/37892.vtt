00:01.366 --> 00:03.365
What if this could change the world?

00:03.607 --> 00:04.325
A burrito?

00:04.981 --> 00:05.373
Yeah.

00:06.285 --> 00:07.039
It can't.

00:07.827 --> 00:08.172
It could.

00:09.184 --> 00:10.585
You are so weird.

00:11.161 --> 00:11.693
It could.

00:12.229 --> 00:14.910
It could change how we plant things and grow things.

00:15.115 --> 00:18.039
And improve the dirt where we grow those things.

00:18.364 --> 00:20.637
It could save water by changing how we use it.

00:21.396 --> 00:24.735
It can make us more responsible and sustainable.

00:25.032 --> 00:29.463
It could change how we pick things, move things and transportation things.

00:29.570 --> 00:31.123
What? That's not a thing.

00:31.941 --> 00:32.533
Whatever.

00:33.345 --> 00:35.137
It could make our farmers happier.

00:35.335 --> 00:37.199
And they can make our animals happier.

00:37.357 --> 00:39.346
Can trees be happier? Probably.

00:39.532 --> 00:40.812
We could do things more locally,...

00:40.928 --> 00:42.339
...so, everyone's happier.

00:42.460 --> 00:44.415
More organic, more real.

00:44.553 --> 00:49.115
Soil-helping, future-facing, less carbon-emitting and world-changing.

00:50.097 --> 00:51.443
Are you still talking?
