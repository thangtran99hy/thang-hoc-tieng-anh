00:00.900 --> 00:07.170
If the world gave us a second chance, what would we do?

00:12.479 --> 00:13.405
Should we do good?

00:15.065 --> 00:16.229
Or should we do better?

00:23.862 --> 00:25.559
Should we push for what we believe in?

00:33.738 --> 00:37.443
Should we empower others to speak and have their voices heard?

00:41.075 --> 00:43.884
Let's strive to save what we can while we can.

00:48.685 --> 00:51.579
Share more knowledge to build and not to destroy.

00:54.068 --> 00:56.652
Show the ways to heal and not to hurt.

00:58.922 --> 01:00.474
Let's strive to live smarter,...

01:01.702 --> 01:03.103
...to make the world better.

01:04.155 --> 01:07.437
Because it doesn't matter who, what or where you are.

01:08.221 --> 01:13.376
We have the power to create a better world, not just for ourselves, but for the good of all.

01:16.231 --> 01:19.423
The world is now on reset and is giving us a second chance.

01:20.757 --> 01:22.669
We have it in our hands to do better.
