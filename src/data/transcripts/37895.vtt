WEBVTT

00:00.155 --> 00:02.727
The Google Data Center in Dublin, Ireland.

00:03.557 --> 00:06.623
The scale of what we do here can be kind of crazy.

00:07.238 --> 00:09.879
Millions of searches a day goes through those machines.

00:10.326 --> 00:12.741
That's why they're very loud and they produce lots of heat.

00:12.783 --> 00:16.056
That means they're constantly working, constantly answering your queries.

00:17.562 --> 00:20.754
And so how do we really store the web, so to speak?

00:21.718 --> 00:25.543
The way to think about it is we take the internet, download it,...

00:25.900 --> 00:33.575
...index it, and chop it into small pieces, and then each server has a small piece.

00:34.585 --> 00:37.467
All of the servers for that data center work together...

00:37.524 --> 00:40.275
...to each search their little part of the internet.

00:41.140 --> 00:44.515
And it literally takes millions of servers and hard drives...

00:44.659 --> 00:46.649
...to be able to support the world's websites.

00:47.919 --> 00:52.392
So each of these data centers has a complete copy of the web.

00:53.347 --> 00:57.435
So if you're in France or if you're in South Africa, you're not sending...

00:57.538 --> 01:00.019
...a query that goes through the wires on underwater cables...

01:00.143 --> 01:02.849
...and comes from Mountain View, asks that question, then we send it back.

01:03.601 --> 01:04.498
That's just not possible.

01:04.680 --> 01:06.801
That's never going to work as a solution that's fast.

01:07.899 --> 01:11.360
How it actually works is you go into Google and you type in a search,..

01:14.349 --> 01:18.555
...then we direct your query to the data center that is closest.

01:19.059 --> 01:22.297
And so that's actually the reason why we have data centers everywhere,...

01:22.595 --> 01:25.065
...because we want to be close to the users that we're serving.

01:25.427 --> 01:29.813
Because that's the only way to get you the most accurate response as fast as possible.
