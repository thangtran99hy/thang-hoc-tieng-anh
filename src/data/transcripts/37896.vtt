00:03.454 --> 00:06.431
If you're always in the spotlight, how do you make room for someone else?

00:08.666 --> 00:10.475
You know, Hamilton goes his own way.

00:10.643 --> 00:12.573
Does he have a comfort zone?

00:14.331 --> 00:17.970
I see your point, but is the No. 1 racing driver only looking after himself?

00:21.020 --> 00:25.079
Alicia Keys is always busy, but how can she stay in touch with her loved ones?

00:25.196 --> 00:25.933
Hey ma.

00:25.948 --> 00:26.605
Hi baby.

00:26.634 --> 00:28.257
Hi, how are you doing?

00:28.524 --> 00:29.405
I'm doing good.

00:29.450 --> 00:31.500
Good, we're just on our way back from the beach.

00:32.317 --> 00:36.876
And I have to tell you, as a professional athlete, you cannot stay up late nights.

00:38.321 --> 00:41.175
If everyone knows you, where can you really feel safe?

00:43.659 --> 00:46.372
Can Lewis keep his head up under all this pressure?

00:49.369 --> 00:51.883
Hamilton would never stop for someone else.

00:55.783 --> 00:57.844
If Federer constantly travels...

00:58.069 --> 01:00.497
...there's no way he can find time for his fans.

01:04.359 --> 01:06.578
Music has always played the biggest role in her life.

01:06.694 --> 01:09.553
It's tough to make your fans happy and your family.

01:15.430 --> 01:17.271
Lewis Hamilton wins.
