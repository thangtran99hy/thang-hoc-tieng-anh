Color really is capable of evoking sensations...

00:06.127 --> 00:11.745
...and evoking memory, evoking happiness or sadness,...

00:11.867 --> 00:16.051
...even when thinking about that on the surface of a map...

00:16.103 --> 00:20.121
...and reflecting these natural places, that's really powerful.

00:21.617 --> 00:24.895
When I joined Google Maps pretty quickly I realized...

00:25.035 --> 00:28.928
...that there was just a lot of complexity on the map, like 700 colors.

00:30.813 --> 00:33.409
The process really started with a hypothesis...

00:33.481 --> 00:37.134
...that we were able to reduce this really complex system...

00:37.264 --> 00:43.459
...down to a core set of colors, but also bringing this life or energy to the map.

00:44.232 --> 00:48.281
It wasn't really even about choosing colors, like out of the air.

00:48.359 --> 00:53.135
It was about looking at this palette that we use for most design at Google,...

00:53.385 --> 00:57.158
...and then looking at the natural landscape and seeing how we could draw those connections.

00:58.792 --> 01:03.712
Some of the areas, while we sort of had a notion of what they looked like, surprised us.

01:04.862 --> 01:11.178
Previously, the color for the tundra area that is north of Canada was this light gray,...

01:11.374 --> 01:15.272
...which, in reality, was not actually how it looked in satellite imagery,...

01:15.449 --> 01:18.033
...which is these stone-deep grays.

01:18.707 --> 01:24.199
Large swaths of desert areas in Africa didn't feel reflective of the places themselves.

01:24.903 --> 01:29.233
It really didn't sit right with me in terms of understanding regionally...

01:29.451 --> 01:31.389
...what that desert actually looks like.

01:31.986 --> 01:33.801
You need to believe what you're seeing on the map,...

01:33.952 --> 01:36.211
...that's so important and you need to have the confidence...

01:36.355 --> 01:38.567
...that it's reflecting the world that you're living in.

01:40.309 --> 01:43.361
The way that we were shaping how to bring all these colors together...

01:43.504 --> 01:46.283
...were from personal experiences across the team.

01:48.517 --> 01:53.743
It came back to that responsibility of, is this reflective of that place?
