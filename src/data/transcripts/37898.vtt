Bill Gates is on another cover today and this is the cover of his very own book.

00:03.788 --> 00:06.567
It's Gates' vision of what the next 20 years will bring.

00:06.603 --> 00:08.303
It's called "The Road Ahead." Ladies and gentlemen,...

00:08.381 --> 00:10.425
...please welcome Bill Gates, Bill!

00:10.747 --> 00:14.641
I think if I'd known how much time it would take to write a book,...

00:14.721 --> 00:16.961
...I might not have done a book.

00:17.686 --> 00:22.921
This 1995 book projects a lot of changes driven by technology...

00:22.988 --> 00:25.221
...and mostly I got a lot of things right.

00:25.483 --> 00:26.635
What did you get right?

00:26.979 --> 00:29.872
The internet would become more available.

00:29.979 --> 00:33.002
"The global interactive network will transform our culture...

00:33.065 --> 00:36.746
...as dramatically as Gutenberg's press did the Middle Ages."

00:37.147 --> 00:39.797
You'll have electronic mail, you'll have videoconferencing,...

00:40.132 --> 00:41.564
...so you can work out of your house.

00:41.768 --> 00:45.697
The basic revolution that everything's connected...

00:45.774 --> 00:49.795
...and how that's changed our world, that really did come true.

00:49.832 --> 00:55.749
Once you have this small wallet PC, it'll replace almost everything you carry today.

00:55.933 --> 01:01.685
What I called the wallet PC talked about what's become the miracle of the cell phone.

01:01.819 --> 01:05.514
The pictures of your kids, it will store thousands and thousands of them for you.

01:05.617 --> 01:07.043
That I got right.
