Living Things.

00:03.809 --> 00:06.489
Living things are all around us.

00:06.857 --> 00:08.386
We are living things.

00:08.973 --> 00:10.715
Animals are living things.

00:11.225 --> 00:13.138
Plants are living things too.

00:13.845 --> 00:16.014
What makes something a living thing?

00:16.757 --> 00:22.766
Living things eat, breathe, grow and make more of itself.

00:23.373 --> 00:25.968
Can you think of an example of a living thing?

00:26.829 --> 00:28.230
Animals are living things.

00:28.819 --> 00:30.902
There are many different types of animals.

00:31.235 --> 00:32.541
They all look different.

00:32.951 --> 00:35.375
But they all have one thing in common.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.819
They are all living things.

00:38.341 --> 00:39.997
Humans are living things too.

00:40.482 --> 00:41.797
And so are plants.

00:42.287 --> 00:47.869
Plants are living things because they breathe, eat, grow, and make more of themselves.

00:48.351 --> 00:50.519
Plants need food and water to live.

00:51.051 --> 00:55.865
Non-living things do not eat, breathe, grow or make more of themselves.
