00:01.159 --> 00:02.679
What has been decided here?

00:03.093 --> 00:08.879
Years after the verdict that took Lula out of the last presidential election campaign...

00:08.952 --> 00:09.759
...and took him to prison,...

00:10.097 --> 00:13.893
...what has now been decided is that the court that made that decision...

00:14.189 --> 00:17.644
...was not the adequate forum to judge this case.

00:18.131 --> 00:22.487
So, Lula is back in the game, and he regained his political rights,...

00:23.381 --> 00:29.883
...but one possible interpretation here is that this also protects Sergio Moro,...

00:30.267 --> 00:32.901
...the judge who made the decision.

00:33.471 --> 00:38.381
That's because Sergio Moro later became Justice Minister...

00:38.581 --> 00:40.334
...in the government of Jair Bolsonaro.

00:40.425 --> 00:44.955
So, it seems he had a clear and definite interest in the election...

00:45.456 --> 00:47.785
...for which he had rendered Lula ineligible,...

00:48.225 --> 00:54.024
...and it seems from intercepted conversations that in his role as judge,...

00:54.296 --> 00:58.063
...he's also alleged to have been coaching the prosecution side.

00:58.324 --> 01:02.053
So, his partiality, lack of partiality is in question.

01:02.406 --> 01:03.969
Now, that's under investigation.

01:04.264 --> 01:06.725
That investigation may now be halted...

01:06.997 --> 01:11.367
...as a result of the decision taken today by Brazil's supreme court.
