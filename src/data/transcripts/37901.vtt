Mrs. Long?

00:07.723 --> 00:08.272
Yes.

00:08.937 --> 00:10.877
We've found a baby girl for your adoption.

00:10.999 --> 00:13.200
But, there are some things you need to know.

00:14.933 --> 00:17.881
She's in Siberia and she was born with a rare condition.

00:18.897 --> 00:21.437
Her legs will need to be amputated.

00:23.249 --> 00:24.825
I know this is difficult to hear.

00:26.065 --> 00:28.515
Her life, it won't be easy.

00:39.026 --> 00:39.807
Mrs. Long?

00:41.307 --> 00:44.479
It might not be easy, but it'll be amazing.

00:46.338 --> 00:48.045
I can't wait to meet her.
