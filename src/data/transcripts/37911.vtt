Freya Heddington's world was turned upside down two years ago...

00:05.774 --> 00:08.520
...when she was diagnosed with restrictive cardiomyopathy.

00:08.846 --> 00:12.161
The heart condition causes tiredness, chest pain and breathing problems,...

00:12.572 --> 00:14.579
...and Freya was going to need a heart transplant.

00:14.931 --> 00:18.025
The 14-year-old is expected to have to wait two years for the procedure,...

00:18.358 --> 00:20.091
...but it ended up being just two months.

00:20.559 --> 00:23.643
Ecstatic that I got such an amazing gift of a heart,...

00:23.977 --> 00:27.879
...but it's also upsetting to know that someone also died.

00:28.360 --> 00:31.317
Freya received a new heart thanks to pioneering technology...

00:31.591 --> 00:34.652
...which capitalizes on harvesting hearts from a range of donors.

00:35.079 --> 00:37.354
Usually the vital organ is taken from patients...

00:37.645 --> 00:39.803
...who are brain dead but their hearts are still beating,...

00:40.165 --> 00:43.693
...but a new procedure first done at a hospital in Cambridge in 2015...

00:44.111 --> 00:47.336
...retrieves adult donor hearts have been allowed to stop beating on their own...

00:47.471 --> 00:49.179
...after life support has been withdrawn.

00:49.467 --> 00:51.945
A special device is able to then restart the heart...

00:52.071 --> 00:55.721
...and ensure it is healthy before it is transplanted into a patient.

00:56.001 --> 00:59.389
Initially, the procedure was only available to adults in need of transplants,...

00:59.998 --> 01:03.996
...but the Royal Papworth Hospital has since teamed up with Great Ormond Street Hospital...

01:04.214 --> 01:06.457
...to ensure children can also benefit from it.

01:06.729 --> 01:10.189
Transplant surgeon Marius Berman says more lives have been saved.

01:10.540 --> 01:14.745
In the adult world, we double the amount of heart transplantation...

01:15.413 --> 01:19.440
...and we reduce the waiting time period...

01:19.747 --> 01:23.315
...and we had to do exactly the same thing for the pediatric recipients,...

01:24.147 --> 01:30.313
...at the same time, for both population, to reduce the mortality in the waiting list,...

01:30.743 --> 01:32.375
...and that is what we achieved.

01:32.558 --> 01:35.653
Freya is one of six British youngsters to have received a new heart...

01:35.763 --> 01:36.789
...using the procedure.

01:37.113 --> 01:39.509
Only four others have been carried out worldwide.
