Do you know microplastics?

00:02.578 --> 00:05.493
Microplastics are observed not only in the sea...

00:05.611 --> 00:08.249
...but also in the mountains and the atmosphere.

00:08.914 --> 00:10.983
There are two types of microplastics.

00:11.414 --> 00:13.960
One has been manufactured in micro size,...

00:14.117 --> 00:16.465
...for instance, the scrub in microbeads...

00:16.785 --> 00:20.148
...that are ingrained in toothpaste and detergent.

00:20.492 --> 00:24.949
The other one is manufactured in large sizes such as PET bottles...

00:25.328 --> 00:28.831
...that have been crushed and subdivided into micro sizes...

00:28.930 --> 00:34.277
...in the natural environment under the influence of ultraviolet rays and collagens.

00:35.045 --> 00:40.371
According to research, we consume one credit card worth of microplastics a week...

00:40.529 --> 00:42.698
...through the air, food and so on.

00:43.183 --> 00:49.883
Also, we discharge microplastics into the sea and rivers by washing synthetic fiberglasses.

00:50.482 --> 00:52.907
What should we do now for a better Earth?
