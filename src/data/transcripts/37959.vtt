00:01.063 --> 00:03.054
Has this ever happened to you?

00:03.363 --> 00:06.123
Your umbrella turns inside out during the storm.

00:07.705 --> 00:09.348
It even happened to the President.

00:10.895 --> 00:15.875
Now a company claims to have built the world's most indestructible umbrella.

00:16.243 --> 00:20.957
It's called the Davek and costs as much as $350.

00:21.158 --> 00:23.370
We use an amalgam of different materials.

00:23.513 --> 00:27.000
Stainless steel, aircraft grade aluminum, fiberglass...

00:27.435 --> 00:31.229
...and putting those together gives you the right balance....

00:31.407 --> 00:33.252
...between rigidity and flexibility.

00:33.495 --> 00:35.663
But is it really indestructible?

00:35.921 --> 00:39.598
Our Victoria Ricano tried it out with a wind machine.

00:39.961 --> 00:43.879
I'm putting my safety glasses on and putting it to the test.

00:44.199 --> 00:45.477
Fire up the wind machine.

00:48.341 --> 00:49.668
Let's see how this holds up.

00:55.164 --> 00:58.843
The wind machine blows inside out but here's what's important.

00:59.040 --> 01:01.260
It doesn't destroy the umbrella.

01:01.442 --> 01:03.233
And you can pop it right back into place.

01:04.270 --> 01:07.026
We can't say that about our cheap umbrella.

01:07.253 --> 01:08.578
Wow, look what happened.

01:09.329 --> 01:11.551
Now a wind machine is one thing.

01:11.704 --> 01:14.048
What does mother nature have to say?

01:14.367 --> 01:17.222
Inside Edition reporter Alison Hall tried it out.

01:17.807 --> 01:20.701
Holding up so far going this way, and the real test,...

01:21.007 --> 01:22.457
...will it go this way?

01:23.129 --> 01:23.625
Wow!

01:24.151 --> 01:25.425
The umbrella is holding up!

01:27.861 --> 01:28.819
Oh my goodness!
