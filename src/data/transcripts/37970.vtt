What happened to the only Japanese passenger on the Titanic?

00:05.379 --> 00:10.108
Masabumi Hosono was the only Japanese passenger on the RMS Titanic.

00:10.871 --> 00:14.149
As a civil servant working for the Japanese Ministry of Transport,...

00:14.432 --> 00:17.795
...he researched Imperial Russia's railway system in 1910.

00:18.247 --> 00:20.971
His journey back to Japan then took him to Britain.

00:21.841 --> 00:24.949
After staying in London for a time, he went to South Hampton,...

00:25.111 --> 00:29.678
...where he boarded the RMS Titanic on April 10th 1912 in second class.

00:30.619 --> 00:33.945
During the disaster, as the ship was sinking after hitting an iceberg,...

00:34.253 --> 00:37.403
...passengers began boarding the few lifeboats to evacuate.

00:37.936 --> 00:39.913
Hosono was asleep when the crash happened,...

00:40.127 --> 00:44.055
...but awoke when a Stewardess knocked on his cabin and told him to put on a life jacket.

00:45.013 --> 00:47.414
When he tried to go to the top deck where the lifeboats were,...

00:47.685 --> 00:51.077
...he was blocked by a crewman, who assumed he was a third class passenger.

00:51.550 --> 00:54.495
But eventually he slipped passed and reached the top deck.

00:55.837 --> 00:59.863
All the while flares were signaling emergency were being shot into the air ceaselessly,...

01:00.079 --> 01:03.011
...and hideous blue flashes and noises were simply terrifying.

01:03.334 --> 01:08.660
"Somehow I could in no way dispel the feeling of utter dread and desolation," Hosono wrote.

01:09.537 --> 01:12.908
He found a lifeboat, when an officer shouted, "Room for two more!"

01:13.257 --> 01:15.213
And survived the Titanic disaster.
