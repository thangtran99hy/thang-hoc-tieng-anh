00:00.599 --> 00:01.665
I'm here in Tokyo.

00:01.997 --> 00:05.493
There's a lot of people here which means there's a lot of mouths to feed.

00:06.080 --> 00:08.515
That represents a challenge for the city of the future.

00:09.077 --> 00:12.957
Tokyo-based mirai has seen the idea of a traditional farm...

00:13.367 --> 00:15.679
...and literally turn it on its side.

00:16.024 --> 00:17.763
They control all the conditions here...

00:18.105 --> 00:22.206
...so you don't have to have perfect soil or perfect weather or even sunlight.

00:22.501 --> 00:25.837
This approach has the potential to overcome farming challenges...

00:26.015 --> 00:28.601
...like yearly weather patterns, changing climate...

00:29.006 --> 00:31.619
...as well as quality and availability of land.
