Hey, Anna, what are your favorite handbags for spring?

00:03.669 --> 00:05.391
To be honest, I rarely wear a handbag...

00:05.543 --> 00:08.221
...but I am told by my team here at Vogue...

00:08.362 --> 00:10.705
...that it's all about the crossbody handbag...

00:11.266 --> 00:15.051
...which makes a lot of sense to me because it's practical, hands-free.

00:15.125 --> 00:19.437
You can bicycle around Manhattan and enjoy in Central Park.

00:19.534 --> 00:23.395
And they also come in every shape, size, fabrication.

00:23.537 --> 00:26.698
So, that would be my tip for the season.
