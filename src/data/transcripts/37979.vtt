00:00.050 --> 00:03.549
On September 21st, Japan's space agency made history.

00:03.978 --> 00:08.877
It became the first country to land not one, but two rovers onto an asteroid,...

00:09.338 --> 00:14.152
...and already, the two unmanned rovers have sent back the first images while on the surface.

00:14.670 --> 00:18.568
And no, so far, it's looking like there are no alien cities on its surface,...

00:18.682 --> 00:21.445
...but this mission, called Hayabusa2,...

00:21.749 --> 00:26.051
...could ultimately help solve one of the grandest scientific mysteries of all,...

00:26.581 --> 00:28.878
...where did life on Earth come from?

00:32.645 --> 00:35.401
Scientists have been studying asteroids for years.

00:35.543 --> 00:41.765
NASA, for example, landed its NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft on Asteroid Eros in 2001,...

00:42.103 --> 00:46.440
...but it's Japan's space agency that is the first to deploy a pair of rovers...

00:46.529 --> 00:48.449
...to explore an asteroid's surface.

00:48.777 --> 00:52.812
Japan launched the Hayabusa2 mission in December 2014,...

00:53.173 --> 00:56.618
...so, it has already been about three and a half years in the making.

00:57.039 --> 01:00.616
The spacecraft rendezvoused with its target in June 2018,...

01:00.795 --> 01:04.244
...snapping a series of pictures that revealed the asteroid's shape.

01:04.853 --> 01:09.966
The asteroid of choice was 162173 Ryugu, or Ryugu for short.

01:10.613 --> 01:14.597
In Japanese, it refers to a magical, underwater dragon palace.

01:14.854 --> 01:18.815
Now, the asteroid flies through space around the sun every 16 months,...

01:19.024 --> 01:21.747
...conveniently, between the orbits of Earth and Mars,...

01:22.050 --> 01:26.973
...making it an ideal target for this mission, which, if all goes according to plan,...

01:27.074 --> 01:31.120
...it will return a sample of the asteroid to Earth by the early 2020s.
