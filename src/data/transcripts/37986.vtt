00:00.122 --> 00:00.864
How's it going?

00:01.728 --> 00:02.481
That's a yes.

00:03.275 --> 00:04.142
That works.

00:04.356 --> 00:05.497
Have you ever walked on a runway?

00:05.896 --> 00:06.414
No.

00:06.585 --> 00:07.978
Now is a good time to start.

00:08.431 --> 00:09.293
Ready? Go.

00:10.122 --> 00:11.249
Excellent, shoulders back.

00:11.857 --> 00:12.573
That's fashion.

00:12.904 --> 00:14.390
Have you ever worked in the fashion industry?

00:14.704 --> 00:14.986
Nope.

00:15.343 --> 00:16.183
Never even tried?

00:16.302 --> 00:17.892
Not really.

00:18.013 --> 00:22.950
That height, that size, the muscle tone, broad shoulders, small waist, long legs.

00:23.267 --> 00:25.181
Everything is pretty much symmetrical,...

00:25.273 --> 00:26.381
...I wouldn't really lose any weight.

00:26.605 --> 00:27.543
Yeah, I'd give him a 10.

00:27.834 --> 00:28.309
Wow.

00:28.488 --> 00:29.129
Absolutely.

00:29.286 --> 00:29.981
Somebody would book him.
