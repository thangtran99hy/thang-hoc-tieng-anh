00:01.665 --> 00:07.309
Before you try riding your bike, walk next to it and practice pressing on the brakes...

00:07.696 --> 00:09.582
...until you get a feel for how they work.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.592
Then, sit on your bike.

00:13.415 --> 00:18.975
Place one foot on one of the pedals, and place your other foot on the ground.

00:20.367 --> 00:24.071
When you're ready, push off with your foot that's on the ground....

00:24.701 --> 00:28.131
...and see how long you can glide on your bike without pedaling.

00:29.543 --> 00:33.319
Keep your eyes forward and look toward where you want to go,...

00:34.001 --> 00:35.255
...which will help you balance.

00:36.883 --> 00:38.961
If you feel yourself starting to tip,...

00:39.699 --> 00:42.621
...place your foot back on the ground to catch yourself.

00:44.143 --> 00:47.831
Keep doing this until you're comfortable balancing on your bike.

00:49.059 --> 00:55.125
Then, do the same thing again. But this time, start pedaling with your feet.

00:56.918 --> 01:00.609
Continue pedaling and steering in the direction you want to go.

01:01.837 --> 01:05.350
The faster you pedal, the easier it will be to balance.

01:07.811 --> 01:13.378
If you need to come to a stop, stop pedaling and press down on the brakes.
