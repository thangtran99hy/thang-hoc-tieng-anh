Some pharmacists wear lab coats.

00:04.333 --> 00:06.336
Mayank Amin dons a different uniform.

00:06.919 --> 00:12.021
Suited up as a superhero, he reaches into subzero storage for his vials of COVID-19 vaccines.

00:12.403 --> 00:15.515
Amin owns the Skippack Pharmacy in Schwenksville, Pennsylvania,...

00:15.785 --> 00:17.636
...a small community outside Philadelphia.

00:18.055 --> 00:22.181
And on a recent March morning, he headed out to a gym, converted into a vaccine clinic,...

00:22.455 --> 00:24.375
...to help protect lives in his community.

00:25.113 --> 00:28.740
So, we received the COVID vaccine just about a month ago.

00:29.627 --> 00:30.861
It's truly been a community effort.

00:31.403 --> 00:33.367
Thanks to deep ties with their communities...

00:33.452 --> 00:35.746
...and the trust they've been able to establish over the years,...

00:35.982 --> 00:38.634
...small local pharmacies are instrumental in reaching people...

00:38.716 --> 00:40.695
...who might be reluctant to get vaccinated...

00:40.946 --> 00:42.775
...or may not know about vaccination efforts.

00:43.149 --> 00:46.797
Amin has administered about 4,000 vaccine doses since February,...

00:47.013 --> 00:50.893
...with help from one employee, two pharmacy interns and teams of volunteers...

00:50.983 --> 00:52.944
...who help prep patients and paperwork.
