Falafel Inc. started out as a single restaurant in 2017.

00:05.467 --> 00:09.555
Now, owner Ahmad Ashkar has over 20 locations worldwide.

00:10.127 --> 00:13.789
He credits the restaurant's success to special family recipes.

00:14.111 --> 00:16.951
Falafel Inc. is no ordinary fast food restaurant.

00:17.234 --> 00:22.856
Ashkar's eateries also use his family's recipes to make food for refugees.

00:23.383 --> 00:27.317
So, with every meal, anyone who purchases at Falafel Inc., we help feed the poor...

00:27.604 --> 00:28.432
...and feed the hungry.

00:28.748 --> 00:33.441
And since launching, we fed over 250,000 refugees,...

00:33.769 --> 00:36.131
...people who otherwise wouldn't have had anything to eat.

00:36.336 --> 00:40.591
Ashkar also employs refugees and immigrants including Imed,...

00:40.883 --> 00:44.146
...who works as a cashier at the Washington DC location.

00:44.659 --> 00:47.317
Imed says he's proud to work at Falafel Inc....

00:47.585 --> 00:49.991
...and intends to help others like himself.
