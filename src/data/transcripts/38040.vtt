00:00.631 --> 00:03.148
So, we're gonna start with some rapid-fire questions.

00:03.493 --> 00:03.719
Okay.

00:04.428 --> 00:07.471
How many people have walked on the moon in the last 25 years?

00:08.377 --> 00:08.783
Zero.

00:09.157 --> 00:13.036
What is the sum of e, raised to the power of i times pi and one?

00:13.924 --> 00:14.279
Zero.

00:14.706 --> 00:16.667
How many times have you climbed Mount Everest?

00:17.237 --> 00:18.901
I wish I'd done it, but zero.

00:19.304 --> 00:21.241
How many times have you had your mugshot taken?

00:22.329 --> 00:24.677
You know, I wish zero, but the answer is one.

00:26.383 --> 00:28.573
What is the probability that you'll live forever?

00:29.528 --> 00:29.871
Zero.

00:30.300 --> 00:33.142
What two numbers do you need to know to avoid a climate disaster?

00:33.609 --> 00:35.228
Fifty-one billion and zero.

00:35.653 --> 00:39.429
The world emits 51 billion tons of greenhouse gas each year...

00:39.631 --> 00:41.397
..and we need to drive that to zero.
