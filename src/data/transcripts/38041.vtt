With Look to Speak, you can use your eyes to select prewritten phrases...

00:04.684 --> 00:06.055
...and have them spoken aloud.

00:06.768 --> 00:09.411
To select items on screen, keep your head still...

00:09.669 --> 00:14.299
...and look right, left, or up,...

00:14.785 --> 00:17.555
...each time looking off screen to make your selection.

00:18.299 --> 00:20.545
From the main screen, look left or right...

00:20.793 --> 00:23.129
...to select the list with the phrase you want to say.

00:25.637 --> 00:28.641
Each time you select a list, the phrases will narrow down...

00:29.873 --> 00:31.549
...until you get to the one you want.

00:33.949 --> 00:38.015
At any point, you can look up to cancel and start again.

00:38.300 --> 00:38.849
How are you?

00:39.315 --> 00:41.935
If you want to take a break, you can look up to snooze.

00:42.606 --> 00:45.285

00:46.186 --> 00:47.757
If you're helping someone set up,...

00:48.083 --> 00:51.828
...mount the device securely and position it close enough to read the phrases,...

00:52.074 --> 00:53.374
...slightly below eye level.

00:54.245 --> 00:58.317
If you need more help, tap the menu and try the setup helper.

01:00.693 --> 01:02.365

01:05.441 --> 01:07.398
