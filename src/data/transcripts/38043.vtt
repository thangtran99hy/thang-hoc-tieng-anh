00:02.641 --> 00:07.906
A team of researchers from MIT, Harvard University and City University of Hong Kong...

00:08.218 --> 00:14.353
...have developed tiny agile drones who look, act and maneuver like actual insects.

00:16.202 --> 00:21.187
This new generation of tiny drones are powered by a new class of soft actuator...

00:21.404 --> 00:25.095
...made of thin rubber cylinders coated in carbon nanotubes.

00:25.365 --> 00:28.109
When voltage is applied to the carbon nanotubes,...

00:28.211 --> 00:33.111
...they produce an electrostatic force that squeezes and elongates the rubber cylinder.

00:34.143 --> 00:39.713
Repeated elongation and contraction is what causes the drones' wings to beat very fast...

00:40.053 --> 00:43.459
...and with enough power density to actually support flight.

00:44.718 --> 00:47.752
Typically, drones require wide, open spaces...

00:47.900 --> 00:51.183
...because they're neither nimble enough to navigate confined ones...

00:51.362 --> 00:54.427
...nor robust enough to withstand collisions in a crowd.

00:55.231 --> 01:01.709
However, these insect-sized drones can flap its tiny wings nearly 500 times per second,...

01:02.220 --> 01:06.053
...giving it the ability to recover if hit or involved in a collision...

01:07.001 --> 01:10.667
...and do some aggressive maneuvers like somersaults in the air.

01:13.575 --> 01:17.971
This insect-like resilience is packed into just 0.6 grams,...

01:18.356 --> 01:20.951
...the approximate weight of a large bumblebee.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.082
The researchers hope one day,...

01:24.168 --> 01:27.153
...the robots could aid humans by pollinating crops...

01:27.449 --> 01:29.578
...or completing search-and-rescue missions...

01:29.795 --> 01:34.541
...and navigating complex machinery to ensure safety and functionality.
