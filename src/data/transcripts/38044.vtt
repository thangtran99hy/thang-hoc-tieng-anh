Autocomplete is a feature within Google search...

00:05.788 --> 00:08.789
...designed to make it faster to complete searches you're beginning to type.

00:09.138 --> 00:13.371
We created it to help save people time, which it definitely does.

00:13.709 --> 00:17.560
On average, Autocomplete reduces typing by about 25 percent.

00:18.291 --> 00:20.342
How it works, at a very basic level,...

00:20.507 --> 00:22.979
...is by looking at what you're starting to type in the search bar,...

00:23.281 --> 00:25.854
...sorting through trillions of past Google searches...

00:25.930 --> 00:28.303
...to find ones that include the letters you just typed,...

00:28.875 --> 00:31.061
...then displaying some of the most common ones.

00:32.054 --> 00:33.663
So, what you see in Autocomplete...

00:33.758 --> 00:37.143
...are predictions based on lots of data about how people search.

00:37.871 --> 00:41.661
That's why the first queries you typically see are your own past searches,...

00:41.958 --> 00:44.402
...because data tell us users tend to repeat them.

00:44.741 --> 00:47.083
Those predictions are indicated by a clock icon.

00:47.303 --> 00:49.085
And you can delete them right in the search bar,...

00:49.333 --> 00:51.429
...or you can visit your Google Account page.

00:52.514 --> 00:54.803
Another thing to know is that a common query...

00:54.905 --> 00:57.944
...in one part of the world may not be so common in another.

00:58.738 --> 01:00.855
That's why Autocomplete considers location,...

01:01.067 --> 01:03.991
...as well as the language being used, when displaying predictions.

01:04.621 --> 01:07.729
Autocomplete also takes into account what searches have been trending,...

01:08.085 --> 01:11.159
...which is why queries related to the news or recent events...

01:11.300 --> 01:13.320
...may move up the list of predictions when relevant.

01:14.049 --> 01:17.262
The last thing Autocomplete factors in is what you won't see,...

01:17.714 --> 01:23.339
...predictions identified as inappropriate, harmful, or otherwise against our policies.

01:23.768 --> 01:26.467
We don't stop anyone from searching for whatever they want.

01:26.723 --> 01:30.931
We've simply designed policies so people won't be unintentionally surprised,...

01:31.109 --> 01:34.963
...shocked, or otherwise shown unhelpful predictions in Autocomplete,...

01:35.440 --> 01:38.135
...because Autocomplete has always been about getting you...

01:38.244 --> 01:40.285
...to what you're really looking for quicker.

01:40.689 --> 01:43.242
And with billions of searches being completed every day,...

01:43.672 --> 01:48.322
...our predictions will keep getting better, getting you to results even faster.
