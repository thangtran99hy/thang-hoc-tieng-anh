The massive cargo ship that's been blocking the Suez Canal since last week...

00:05.667 --> 00:07.231
...has finally been freed,...

00:07.704 --> 00:10.267
...and the huge backlog of other vessels,...

00:10.660 --> 00:14.619
...hundreds of them waiting to pass through, is starting to move again.

00:14.881 --> 00:17.523
That's according to the Canal Authority on Monday.

00:18.081 --> 00:23.928
The 430-yard behemoth known as the Ever Given, became stuck diagonally...

00:24.011 --> 00:27.928
...across a southern section of the canal in high winds on the 23rd of March...

00:28.253 --> 00:30.862
...when it ran aground, blocking a trade route...

00:30.987 --> 00:35.795
...that is used by about 15 percent of the world's shipping traffic for 6 days...

00:36.081 --> 00:40.182
...and costing the canal 14 to 15 million dollars a day.

00:40.687 --> 00:44.525
The Suez Canal Authority's chairman Admiral Osama Rabi...

00:44.748 --> 00:47.494
...has said that investigations will show that the organization...

00:47.585 --> 00:49.576
...wasn't responsible for the incident.

00:50.199 --> 00:52.953
After dredging an excavation work over the weekend,...

00:53.141 --> 00:57.337
...rescue workers from the authority and a team from Dutch firm Smit Salvage,...

00:57.591 --> 01:01.849
...succeeded in partially refloating the ship earlier on Monday using tugboats...

01:02.000 --> 01:03.967
...according to marine and shipping sources.

01:04.943 --> 01:09.667
The Ever Given is now being moved to a lake that sits along the canal for inspection.

01:09.979 --> 01:13.897
Admiral Rabi has also said it could take from two and a half to three days...

01:13.992 --> 01:16.115
...to clear the traffic jam of other ships.

01:16.673 --> 01:20.277
Shipping group Maersk said the knock-on effects on global shipping...

01:20.372 --> 01:23.291
...could take weeks or months to unravel.
