00:00.587 --> 00:03.938
Millions of communities around the world rely on the industries...

00:04.041 --> 00:08.413
...that mine, make and transport the things we use today.

00:09.481 --> 00:13.955
That means that everywhere in the world, energy transitions will be disruptive.

00:15.127 --> 00:18.774
Those disruptions will ultimately make us successful.

00:18.995 --> 00:23.020
But, they also mean finding new ways to manufacture products,...

00:23.517 --> 00:27.547
...generate electricity, move people and cargo from place to place,...

00:27.663 --> 00:30.921
...produce food, and heat and cool our buildings.

00:31.325 --> 00:33.987
And these new ways may not use the same workforce...

00:34.137 --> 00:37.189
...or be located in the same place as the old ways.

00:37.535 --> 00:41.284
Unfortunately, this conversation sometimes happens as an afterthought,...

00:41.459 --> 00:43.609
...when it's already too late to undo the damage.

00:43.714 --> 00:48.089
...or without including the communities that are affected by the changes.

00:48.657 --> 00:50.145
We can do it differently.

00:50.513 --> 00:52.927
In the race to develop new technologies...

00:53.037 --> 00:55.823
...to replace the ones that emit greenhouse gases,...

00:55.979 --> 00:57.400
...we have to consider the families...

00:57.578 --> 01:00.672
...that depend on the old technologies for a paycheck.

01:01.071 --> 01:02.206
If we're thoughtful about it,...

01:02.327 --> 01:05.481
...we can guarantee that the technological transformation...

01:05.580 --> 01:10.769
...we need to address climate change actually creates good, safe jobs...

01:10.900 --> 01:13.267
...and a more equitable, prosperous economy.

01:13.527 --> 01:18.113
We need to plan for these transitions either to the new technologies...

01:18.273 --> 01:21.766
...or to entirely new economic opportunities...

01:21.961 --> 01:25.211
...at the same time as we're inventing the new tools...

01:25.342 --> 01:28.685
...to complete the overall energy transition.

01:29.354 --> 01:34.406
We need to work with communities to design transitions that will benefit everyone,...

01:34.511 --> 01:36.739
...including coal miners in West Virginia,...

01:36.973 --> 01:39.786
...factory workers in Ohio and North Carolina,...

01:39.998 --> 01:44.485
...farmers across the American Heartland, long-haul truckers in China...

01:44.793 --> 01:48.066
...and railroad workers who move coal across India.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.185
No matter where we live or where we come from,...

01:51.403 --> 01:53.713
...we all want to build stronger communities.

01:54.081 --> 01:56.765
The only way to do that is to work together.
