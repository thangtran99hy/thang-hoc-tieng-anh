00:03.131 --> 00:05.779
It's so difficult to explain what I feel now...

00:06.854 --> 00:11.095
...because it was a really difficult day I think for all skaters.

00:11.204 --> 00:12.561
Certainly you could see it.

00:13.044 --> 00:15.358
I try to do my best on the ice.

00:15.482 --> 00:21.876
There were some moments that I'm not satisfied with, but after my performance,...

00:21.977 --> 00:25.247
...I really understand that I fight for every element,...

00:25.342 --> 00:30.017
...I tried to do my best in every second of my program.

00:30.533 --> 00:35.883
And so I was really surprised when I saw the place and so, so happy.

00:36.538 --> 00:39.902
And I really understand that every jump was so important.

00:41.825 --> 00:45.885
Like before the short program, I really didn't think about any places here.

00:46.217 --> 00:49.243
I just thought only about my programs.

00:49.657 --> 00:52.842
But after the short program, when I was first,...

00:53.687 --> 00:58.693
...first I became more nervous because I felt like it's my chance.

00:59.185 --> 01:05.266
And maybe it's better that we had one day between short and free program...

01:06.725 --> 01:09.715
...because I had time to think about all.

01:12.463 --> 01:14.057
Because yes, I became more nervous...

01:14.136 --> 01:17.474
...after the short program when I realized that I really have chances here.
