Here's a question.

00:02.925 --> 00:07.471
Why would people call an audio recording app "game-changing," "in a different league"...

00:07.740 --> 00:09.437
...and "the best app of the year"?

00:10.598 --> 00:12.449
Not best audio recording app.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.441
The best app.

00:14.663 --> 00:18.132
Maybe because it does a whole lot more than just record.

00:18.362 --> 00:22.559
It can transcribe in real time, so you can see every word being said.

00:22.780 --> 00:24.997
Even hard words like "Worcestershire sauce"...

00:25.124 --> 00:26.179
...and fast words like...

00:26.259 --> 00:28.460
"How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?"

00:28.657 --> 00:30.181
And kinda confusing words like...

00:30.357 --> 00:31.703
"I ate eight plates of cake."

00:32.783 --> 00:34.755
It can recognize sounds you record...

00:35.108 --> 00:37.481
...like music, dogs, and didgeridoos.

00:38.433 --> 00:42.099
You can search all that stuff instantly to find the exact part you're looking for.

00:42.876 --> 00:46.337
And now you can edit your recordings the same way you edit words in a doc.

00:46.493 --> 00:48.172
Just highlight a sentence, and boom!

00:48.295 --> 00:49.318
You're an audio editor.

00:49.403 --> 00:50.133
What sound does a frog make?

00:50.245 --> 00:51.199
Ribbit, ribbit.

00:51.313 --> 00:52.835
And you can share those clips easily...

00:52.928 --> 00:57.245
...by making videos with the waveform and transcript baked in just like this.

00:57.437 --> 01:00.336
Ready to share in all the places you like to share stuff.

01:00.710 --> 01:04.643
And it does all of this, minus the sharing part, without an internet connection.

01:05.527 --> 01:08.622
In case you missed it, without an internet connection,...

01:08.977 --> 01:11.108
...which means it all stays on your phone.

01:11.278 --> 01:13.276
And it's all controlled by you.

01:13.562 --> 01:15.219
Not bad for a recording app.
