00:02.903 --> 00:05.813
Have you ever stopped to think what poverty really is?

00:06.253 --> 00:08.299
Poverty is more than a lack of resources.

00:08.637 --> 00:13.041
It implies malnutrition, a lack of access to education and basic services,...

00:13.260 --> 00:15.460
...discrimination, thousands of issues.

00:15.873 --> 00:18.085
Our world reveals chilling statistics.

00:18.385 --> 00:21.740
For instance, one in every four children under the age of five,..

00:21.884 --> 00:24.534
...still don't reach the adequate height for their age.

00:24.853 --> 00:27.692
There are many people who still live in extreme poverty,...

00:27.853 --> 00:30.598
...meaning they survive on very little money a day.

00:32.180 --> 00:35.325
We have a goal at our fingertips and you can make it possible...

00:35.677 --> 00:39.143
...to completely eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.

00:40.601 --> 00:43.915
We want to ensure all men and women have equal rights...

00:44.005 --> 00:45.259
...to access basic services.

00:45.639 --> 00:48.219
We want to call upon development cooperation...

00:48.549 --> 00:52.563
...to promote policies and projects geared towards eradicating poverty.

00:53.066 --> 00:53.940
Let's do this.

00:54.068 --> 00:55.423
You can make it possible.
