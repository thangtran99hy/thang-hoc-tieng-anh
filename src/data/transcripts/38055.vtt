00:00.851 --> 00:04.683
This world title is unique just because we're in a bubble,...

00:04.765 --> 00:07.370
...we're in a situation where the whole year has just been unknown.

00:08.651 --> 00:11.303
It's just been, as an athlete, uncertain.

00:11.441 --> 00:12.578
We don't know what's going on.

00:13.349 --> 00:15.031
So, to be able to have this opportunity to come here,...

00:15.123 --> 00:18.175
...to be able to compete regardless of whether or not there are fans,...

00:18.403 --> 00:19.665
...it just means a lot to the athletes.

00:19.752 --> 00:22.386
It gives us something to work for, something to look forward to,...

00:22.475 --> 00:24.239
...something just to strive for.

00:24.795 --> 00:27.212
So, I think we're all really happy and lucky to be in this position...

00:27.307 --> 00:28.737
...that we can compete at a competition.

00:30.004 --> 00:33.345
And that being said, this competition was just different.

00:34.098 --> 00:35.886
As an athlete, we love to have people watching.

00:36.001 --> 00:37.721
We love to have people supporting.

00:37.831 --> 00:39.683
So, it's strange to not have that.

00:40.576 --> 00:43.361
I definitely think that the energy from the audience felt lacking...

00:43.456 --> 00:45.291
...and of course they weren't there.

00:45.635 --> 00:48.655
But still, again, returning back to what I was saying,...

00:48.785 --> 00:52.817
...just lucky to be here and it's just awesome to have this opportunity.

00:54.684 --> 00:58.089
Today, I just wanted to remind myself to be present...

00:58.176 --> 01:02.090
...and be happy in this moment and just be calm.

01:02.191 --> 01:05.499
I think that the short program was, I was a little bit frantic...

01:05.578 --> 01:09.639
...and that was partially a result of just not having a lot of competitions this season...

01:09.731 --> 01:11.085
...especially international competitions.

01:11.762 --> 01:12.977
So, the nerves got the better of me.

01:13.074 --> 01:16.008
But this time around, I just felt a lot more calm, a lot more present.

01:16.239 --> 01:18.379
And that helped me perform a lot better...

01:18.500 --> 01:21.149
...so hopefully I can learn from that and keep doing that in the future.
