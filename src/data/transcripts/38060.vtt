00:01.071 --> 00:01.985
So, here's the thing,...

00:02.953 --> 00:04.821
...the climate emergency is upon us,...

00:05.206 --> 00:06.695
...and if we want to make it through this,...

00:06.835 --> 00:10.608
...we have to plant millions of trees, which, you know, Ecosia does,...

00:11.071 --> 00:12.767
...but that's not going to be enough.

00:13.296 --> 00:16.963
We also have to say goodbye to fossil fuels, once and for all,...

00:17.127 --> 00:20.917
...and accelerate the transition to clean, renewable energy.

00:22.766 --> 00:24.131
All the experts agree.

00:24.718 --> 00:29.131
One of our highest priorities as a society has to be cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.

00:29.574 --> 00:34.943
So, as a result, the move to renewable energies is absolutely critical...

00:35.503 --> 00:38.328
...as we attempt to try and address climate change.

00:39.519 --> 00:42.685
Ecosia started building solar plants in 2018.

00:42.911 --> 00:46.215
This way, we now feed enough renewable energy into the grid...

00:46.403 --> 00:51.750
...to power every single one of your Ecosia searches with 100% renewable energy.

00:52.457 --> 00:53.108
But there's more!

00:55.041 --> 00:59.034
So, by running on 100% renewable energy and by using our surplus income...

00:59.123 --> 01:01.975
...in order to finance tree planting projects across the world,...

01:02.293 --> 01:04.032
...we are much more than climate neutral.

01:04.224 --> 01:08.915
Each search is removing substantial amounts of CO2 from the air.

01:11.104 --> 01:13.791
By planting trees, we absorb CO2,...

01:14.443 --> 01:18.737
...and by producing renewable energy, we prevent CO2 from being released.

01:19.290 --> 01:21.051
But that's still not quite good enough for us.

01:21.771 --> 01:24.465
In 2019, we're becoming the first company...

01:24.611 --> 01:27.354
...to produce twice as much renewable energy as we need.

01:27.859 --> 01:32.289
This way, we feed enough renewable energy into the grid to power your searches...

01:32.597 --> 01:34.483
...and to crowd out dirty energy.

01:35.528 --> 01:36.969
So, when you're using Ecosia,...

01:37.299 --> 01:39.843
...you're not just fighting climate change by planting trees,...

01:39.985 --> 01:43.476
...you're not just running on 100% of renewable energy,...

01:43.694 --> 01:46.786
...but you're actively supporting the energy transition...

01:46.932 --> 01:49.207
...to a fully renewable energy system.

01:51.759 --> 01:55.506
With the climate emergency upon us, we have no time to waste.

01:56.068 --> 01:59.644
By using Ecosia, you can both remove CO2 from the atmosphere...

01:59.836 --> 02:04.107
...by planting trees and prevent CO2 from being released in the first place...

02:04.455 --> 02:08.715
...by accelerating the transition to a sustainable, renewable future.
