00:01.942 --> 00:08.246
I dreamed a dream in time gone by...

00:09.057 --> 00:14.938
...when hope was high and life worth living.

00:16.133 --> 00:22.311
I dreamed that love would never die.

00:22.975 --> 00:28.301
I dreamed that God would be forgiving.

00:30.161 --> 00:36.426
Then, I was young and unafraid...

00:37.043 --> 00:43.307
...and dreams were made and used and wasted.

00:44.153 --> 00:50.593
There was no ransom to be paid.

00:50.867 --> 00:57.326
No song unsung, no wine untasted.

00:58.196 --> 01:04.461
But the tigers come at night,...

01:04.872 --> 01:11.153
...with their voices soft as thunder,...

01:11.489 --> 01:17.881
...as they tear your hope apart,...

01:18.267 --> 01:29.992
...as they turn your dream to shame.

01:30.583 --> 01:37.112
He slept a summer by my side.

01:37.345 --> 01:43.905
He filled my days with endless wonder.

01:44.314 --> 01:50.451
He took my childhood in his stride...

01:50.885 --> 01:58.612
...but he was gone when autumn came.

02:00.390 --> 02:06.335
And still I dream he'll come to me,...

02:06.869 --> 02:13.219
...that we will live the years together.

02:13.559 --> 02:19.269
But there are dreams that cannot be...

02:19.802 --> 02:26.297
...and there are storms we cannot weather.

02:29.671 --> 02:35.903
I had a dream my life would be...

02:36.238 --> 02:39.973
...so different from this hell I'm living,...

02:40.081 --> 02:46.303
...so different now from what it seemed.

02:47.074 --> 03:06.405
Now, life has killed the dream I dreamed.
