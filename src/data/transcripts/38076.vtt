A travel bubble between New Zealand and Australia will kick off next week.

00:06.931 --> 00:11.310
New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters on Tuesday...

00:11.403 --> 00:16.897
...that quarantine-free travel will begin on April 19th for the neighboring countries.

00:18.007 --> 00:20.853
She said that conditions for the bubble had been met,...

00:21.115 --> 00:24.189

00:24.652 --> 00:26.859
New Zealand broadcaster 1 News...

00:27.224 --> 00:30.770
...said that the bubble is expected to run on a state-by-state basis...

00:43.660 --> 00:47.193

00:50.471 --> 00:52.485
...better than other developed nations...

00:52.988 --> 00:56.143
...after closing their international borders to non-citizens...

00:56.412 --> 00:59.151
...relatively early during the health crisis.

00:59.751 --> 01:02.327

01:02.688 --> 01:06.451
