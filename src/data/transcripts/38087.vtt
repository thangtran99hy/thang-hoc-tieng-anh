In March 2020, as the pandemic lockdown went into effect,...

00:05.104 --> 00:07.447
...one of the world's largest independent music stores...

00:07.518 --> 00:10.174
...found itself closing down earlier than expected.

00:10.507 --> 00:13.443
We had a lease and our lease was coming to a close.

00:13.815 --> 00:18.744
We were in a pretty unsustainable situation financially on the other spot.

00:18.874 --> 00:20.825
So, we had been looking for a place...

00:20.915 --> 00:23.984
...where we can take the show on the road and recreate the magic.

00:24.095 --> 00:26.954
Amoeba Music planned to leave its Sunset Boulevard address...

00:27.027 --> 00:29.161
...to move to a brand new location in the neighborhood.

00:29.259 --> 00:31.691
While the new Amoeba doesn't have an upstairs section,...

00:31.764 --> 00:34.309
...it does have everything long-time fans expect.

00:34.487 --> 00:37.415
We're still carrying everything that we had carried before,...

00:37.544 --> 00:42.741
...so we're more than just a record store with music and movies and then you get into posters,...

00:42.839 --> 00:47.459
...t-shirts, games, toys, lunchboxes, prayer candles there, you name it.

00:47.555 --> 00:50.513
And we'll be enforcing masks and social distancing...

00:50.957 --> 00:52.239
...and doing everything that we need to do...

00:52.321 --> 00:55.655
...to make sure that it's a safe spot for our customers and our staff.

00:55.929 --> 00:59.308
Hopefully, it's again a very familiar experience for people.

00:59.439 --> 01:03.613
I mean, it still feels connected to this great new space as it did with the old one.
