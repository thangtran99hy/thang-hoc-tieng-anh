00:14.074 --> 00:15.647
I can't say if I'm the greatest,...

00:15.887 --> 00:18.333
...however, I'm the first to win a major.

00:18.741 --> 00:23.613
And if that's the bar, then I've set it.

01:02.373 --> 01:09.703
It's thrilling to think that there are a lot of youngsters in Japan watching today,...

01:10.616 --> 01:15.015
...hopefully in 5, 10 years, when they'll get a little older...

01:16.310 --> 01:18.867
...hopefully some of them will be competing on the world stage.

01:20.389 --> 01:26.058
But I still have a lot of years left so they are going to have to compete against me still.

01:26.475 --> 01:31.997
But I'm happy for them because hopefully they'll be able to follow in my footsteps.

01:58.764 --> 02:01.237
I'm really looking forward to the Olympic Games in Tokyo.

02:02.739 --> 02:11.848
If I am on the team, maybe it looks like I will be, I'll do my best to represent my country....

02:13.958 --> 02:15.243
...and hopefully I'll play well.
