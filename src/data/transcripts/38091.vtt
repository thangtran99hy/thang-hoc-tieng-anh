00:00.377 --> 00:04.927
He was by her side throughout the longest reign of a monarch in British history.

00:05.363 --> 00:08.467
For Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, it wasn't only a marriage,...

00:08.601 --> 00:12.247
...but a life of service to his wife, Queen Elizabeth II.

00:13.071 --> 00:16.877
Born into Greek and Danish royalty, Philip had a lonely childhood.

00:18.110 --> 00:21.164
He was taken under the wing of the British aristocracy.

00:22.253 --> 00:25.956
When he married the then Princess Elizabeth in 1947,...

00:26.045 --> 00:28.296
...he was a promising young naval officer.

00:29.268 --> 00:34.029
It was a fairytale wedding for a country emerging from war and hardship.

00:34.407 --> 00:38.314
It all changed for the young couple when Elizabeth's father, King George VI,...

00:38.512 --> 00:40.875
...died at only 56 years of age.

00:41.211 --> 00:42.379
She became Queen.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.424
And so began life in the Queen's shadow.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.315
Hundreds of engagements a year,...

00:47.633 --> 00:50.827
...he did, however, manage to find time for his own charities,...

00:51.121 --> 00:53.400
...helping young people and conserving wildlife.

00:53.703 --> 00:57.564
His retirement from public duties came in 2017...

00:57.687 --> 01:00.228
...with a send-off from the Royal Marines.

01:04.286 --> 01:09.417
Whatever the faults, his 60 years of public service was admired by many people.

01:10.361 --> 01:13.043
While their marriage was said to have had its ups and downs...

01:13.143 --> 01:14.623
...in the couple's younger years,...

01:14.955 --> 01:18.949
...Prince Philip remained dedicated and supportive to the Queen.

01:19.381 --> 01:22.539
She'll receive immense sympathy from a British public...

01:22.645 --> 01:25.937
...known to view her with respect and affection.
