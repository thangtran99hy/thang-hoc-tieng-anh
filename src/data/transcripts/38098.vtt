00:00.560 --> 00:02.393
I'm in love with Meghan.

00:03.628 --> 00:05.053
I am glad I married her.

00:06.618 --> 00:09.131
We were very happy when our son was born.

00:10.191 --> 00:13.169
Soon, Meghan was bored in Britain.

00:14.385 --> 00:16.486
She did not like many things.

00:17.335 --> 00:21.215
I felt bad that she was sad, so we moved to America.

00:21.867 --> 00:24.053
My grandmother was not pleased,...

00:24.607 --> 00:26.572
...and my brother thought I was crazy.

00:27.453 --> 00:29.323
I'm now worried about the future.
