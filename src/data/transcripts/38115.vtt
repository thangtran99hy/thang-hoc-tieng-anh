Hi, Anne.

00:02.084 --> 00:02.789
Are you busy?

00:03.016 --> 00:04.685
Hi, Anna. Yes.

00:04.997 --> 00:07.409
At 10 a.m., I am writing.

00:08.133 --> 00:10.738
Every day, I do my morning show.

00:11.594 --> 00:12.245
Sorry!

00:12.720 --> 00:13.626
Okay.

00:14.287 --> 00:15.235
See you later.

00:16.385 --> 00:17.513
Hi, Jonathan.

00:17.784 --> 00:18.651
Are you busy?

00:18.923 --> 00:20.139
Yes, I'm busy.

00:20.495 --> 00:24.700
When the studio light is on, I am recording my evening show.

00:24.957 --> 00:25.369
Right.

00:25.761 --> 00:27.317
Sorry about yesterday.

00:27.636 --> 00:28.210
No worries.

00:28.687 --> 00:29.870
May I see the studio?

00:29.963 --> 00:31.319
Um, maybe another time?

00:31.582 --> 00:33.427
Right now, I am busy.

00:34.072 --> 00:34.647
Sure.

00:35.125 --> 00:36.729
Ok, bye.

00:36.926 --> 00:37.409
Bye.
