00:00.050 --> 00:02.519
My mental is way better than last year, too.

00:05.277 --> 00:06.953
Have you ever felt stronger?

00:07.456 --> 00:13.319
Not like before, now my body weight is like 230 but before I was 240.

00:13.913 --> 00:17.175
Not as before but stronger than last year.

00:17.825 --> 00:22.976
Just working out and then eating more, yeah.

00:23.476 --> 00:26.724
I think last year you kind of mentioned that you felt like you disappointed the fans.

00:26.817 --> 00:31.896
So how anxious are you to show the fans what a healthy one year Yu Darvish can do?

00:32.098 --> 00:34.710
So first of all, you know, I want to stay healthy.

00:35.728 --> 00:39.930
And then I want to start 32, 33 starts.

00:41.073 --> 00:46.539
And then I want to give more wins to the Cubs.
