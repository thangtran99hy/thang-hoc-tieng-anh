My feet are not coordinated enough to play soccer.

00:17.490 --> 00:18.791
And I can't sing.

I love lasagna.

00:50.123 --> 00:53.247
My mom makes the best lasagna in town.

00:53.601 --> 00:55.553
Wherever we go, she's the queen.

01:01.039 --> 01:01.431

01:01.499 --> 01:03.092
They came up, I'm not anymore.

01:03.618 --> 01:05.611
