Iga, congratulations. Roland-Garros champion.

00:03.017 --> 00:04.213
Has it sunk in yet?

00:04.307 --> 00:06.216
How do you reflect on the magic of yesterday?

00:06.661 --> 00:10.521
It was pretty hard because I still have a lot of emotions...

00:10.657 --> 00:15.276
...and it was hard to look from another perspective on this whole tournament.

00:15.419 --> 00:19.131
So, I think I'm going to need to have some more time...

00:19.259 --> 00:24.231
...to just get my thoughts straight...

00:24.377 --> 00:29.001
...and just see the whole two weeks from a distance.

00:29.501 --> 00:37.155
So, right now I'm still happy and I'm still kind of shocked.

00:37.459 --> 00:41.279
And right now I'm going to have a lot of responsibilities...

00:41.383 --> 00:45.613
...which are going to be new for me, so it's a new experience.

00:45.916 --> 00:48.991
And I still have some things to learn.

00:49.842 --> 00:53.397
So, I'm just going to enjoy the moment.

00:54.507 --> 00:57.833
There are loads of messages popping in on social media,...

00:57.936 --> 01:01.993
...congratulating you from Djokovic, Osaka, Billie Jean King, Levandusky.

01:02.441 --> 01:04.121
What does that kind of praise mean to you?

01:04.409 --> 01:05.609
Well, it's a lot.

01:06.970 --> 01:13.125
I know that it's a weird feeling having so many popular people behind you...

01:13.504 --> 01:21.097
...and still I feel like I'm not really a celebrity,...

01:21.341 --> 01:25.085
...so it's also overwhelming for me to get messages from people like that.

01:25.229 --> 01:29.110
But it's nice that I have support.

01:29.318 --> 01:31.528
And also I feel like the whole Poland,...

01:32.380 --> 01:34.937
...my country, was behind me the whole tournament.

01:35.051 --> 01:37.770
They were believing in me so I believed in me.

01:38.011 --> 01:42.694
And it was just amazing and I'm really thankful for the whole,...

01:43.642 --> 01:45.925
...for my fans and for the people.

01:46.461 --> 01:49.437
You've had a dream two weeks here, obviously your first Grand Slam...

01:49.528 --> 01:51.065
...but what's been the real highlight for you?

01:51.887 --> 01:57.602
I think winning against Simona Halep was the measure that I'm gonna remember the most.

01:57.711 --> 02:00.114
...and obviously the final and the trophy ceremony.

02:00.429 --> 02:06.744
But I think on the quarterfinal, I finally realized...

02:06.865 --> 02:09.817
...that I can play my best tennis even under pressure.

02:10.649 --> 02:13.485
And during the whole tournament, I've made a huge progress..

02:13.603 --> 02:15.601
...and I was catching confidence in every match.

02:15.712 --> 02:19.538
...so at the end I just felt that I can win with everyone...

02:19.606 --> 02:22.095
...and it was also new for me and amazing.

02:22.592 --> 02:23.961
Thank you so much. Congratulations.

02:24.080 --> 02:24.487
Thank you.
