At Macca's, we believe some things are bigger than all of us,...

00:09.409 --> 00:14.223
...like feeding imaginations through 28 million books in Happy Meals.

00:15.859 --> 00:18.454
Introducing fiber-based straws and cutlery.

00:19.006 --> 00:23.137
Together, we'll save over 860 tons of plastic every year.

00:24.182 --> 00:26.493
Setting young Aussies up for future success.

00:26.605 --> 00:31.078
We're a family of over 106,000 and we're proud of each one.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.686
Helping keep families together.

00:34.379 --> 00:38.339
With your help, we've raised much-needed funds for Ronald McDonald House Charities...

00:39.389 --> 00:41.371
...and things like supporting Aussie farmers,...

00:41.656 --> 00:45.659
...sourcing 100% Australian beef and RSPCA-approved chicken...

00:47.966 --> 00:50.391
...because we all need to do our bit to make a difference.

00:52.031 --> 00:55.139
And for us, this is just the beginning.
