Try to just listen and I think it's more not as much advice,...

00:05.030 --> 00:08.308
...but when I see people who are living fully who they are,...

00:08.781 --> 00:09.805
...who are honestly who they are,...

00:09.907 --> 00:13.570
...who believe what they believe and who stand by it, I know that that's right.

00:14.143 --> 00:17.157
And when I see people who are trying to be something they're not...

00:17.241 --> 00:22.478
...or not speaking their whole truth, I feel very uncomfortable for them.

00:22.597 --> 00:27.590
I think in this life, is very short, in fact...

00:27.725 --> 00:34.773
...and there is no time to be small or selfish...

00:34.893 --> 00:41.105
...or distracted by material possessions or cruelty or opinions...

00:41.195 --> 00:47.025
...or just that you have to just be fully as you are...

00:47.188 --> 00:49.756
...and know your voice and stand by it...

00:49.905 --> 00:52.603
...because I think somebody said once it's not what you do,...

00:52.707 --> 00:54.183
...it's what you choose not to do.
