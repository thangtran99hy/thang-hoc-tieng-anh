00:02.937 --> 00:03.315
Hey!

00:03.732 --> 00:04.569
How are you doing?

00:04.965 --> 00:06.344
Hey, Roger, how are you?

00:06.717 --> 00:08.085
Just relaxing in the Swiss Alps.

00:08.274 --> 00:08.799
Take a look!

00:09.521 --> 00:11.279
Yeah, it's good. Good, good for you.

00:11.610 --> 00:14.431
Listen, about the Switzerland film you want me to do?

00:14.651 --> 00:14.885
Yes!

00:15.024 --> 00:16.487
Did you see the mood film I sent you?

00:16.631 --> 00:17.945
I'm watching it as we speak.

00:18.787 --> 00:19.436
I don't like it.

00:20.108 --> 00:20.487
What?

00:20.949 --> 00:22.906
Just look at where you are, Roger.

00:23.021 --> 00:25.766
I mean, you got your mountains, your skiing resorts,...

00:25.856 --> 00:29.129
...your charming little towns, green valleys...

00:29.315 --> 00:30.233
There's no drama!

00:30.645 --> 00:31.519
No drama at all!

00:31.612 --> 00:32.174
Seriously?

00:32.342 --> 00:33.859
But did you see the bits with the sunset?

00:34.073 --> 00:38.868
Roger, from a certain type of actor, I need an edge, conflict, jeopardy.

00:39.215 --> 00:41.153
Switzerland is just too perfect!

00:41.853 --> 00:43.261
Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:43.329 --> 00:45.003
That's exactly what I am talking about!

00:45.096 --> 00:46.139
You guys are too nice!

00:47.621 --> 00:48.234
Okay, listen.

00:48.508 --> 00:51.898
How about the two of us on this special mission?

00:52.089 --> 00:53.853
We ski down the slope.

00:54.005 --> 00:54.073
What?

00:54.160 --> 00:55.477
We're skiing down a slope together?

00:55.766 --> 00:57.034
We go even skydiving.

00:57.189 --> 00:57.499
Come on...

00:57.859 --> 01:01.107
Then we land on these fields, and the cows are grazing.

01:01.521 --> 01:03.970
Roger, I have to be honest with you.

01:04.584 --> 01:05.443
It's not happening.

01:06.049 --> 01:06.507
Ah!

01:06.820 --> 01:07.588
Sorry, Roger.

01:08.789 --> 01:10.087
Maybe call Hanks.

01:10.864 --> 01:11.371
Who?
