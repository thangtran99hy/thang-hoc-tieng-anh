00:08.291 --> 00:16.006
I found a love for me.

00:17.969 --> 00:25.922
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead.

00:27.610 --> 00:35.667
I found a girl, beautiful and sweet.

00:37.168 --> 00:44.542
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me...

00:45.425 --> 00:51.108
...because we were just kids when we fell in love,...

00:51.541 --> 00:56.014
...not knowing what it was.

00:56.370 --> 01:04.341
I will not give you up this time.

01:05.979 --> 01:15.145
Darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own,...

01:15.615 --> 01:22.221
...and in your eyes, you're holding mine.

01:24.029 --> 01:38.059
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms,...

01:38.397 --> 01:47.045
...barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song.

01:47.261 --> 01:56.214
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath...

01:56.371 --> 02:05.964
...but you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight.
