Kenji of simplesanshin.com here...

00:04.454 --> 00:07.486
...and I'm going to talk about the notes of the sanshin.

00:08.386 --> 00:09.713
And I'll try to keep this video short...

00:09.827 --> 00:13.466
...because I like short videos, so let's get started.

00:14.766 --> 00:17.437
The first thing you want to do is get your sanshin into hon choshi.

00:20.142 --> 00:20.979
That's about right.

00:21.191 --> 00:28.934
This is do, fa, do or C, F, C, for people who like to know those notes,...

00:32.833 --> 00:35.758
...and these are the notes in Japanese.

00:37.667 --> 00:49.196
It's ai, otsu, ro, shi, jo, chu, shaku, ko.

00:49.364 --> 00:50.493
And if you didn't catch that,...

00:50.582 --> 00:55.879
...that's just simply do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do,...

00:56.598 --> 01:06.205
...which is also just C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C.

01:06.631 --> 01:09.209
And if you can figure that out,...

01:09.304 --> 01:11.379
...then you should be able to use an electric tuner...

01:11.559 --> 01:15.709
...or maybe by ear, and you can figure out where to...

01:16.621 --> 01:18.756
...mark your sanshin if that's what you want to do.

01:19.892 --> 01:25.613
This one doesn't have any markings, but this sanshin does.

01:26.557 --> 01:27.155
It's here.

01:27.631 --> 01:29.475
You don't have to worry about some of these but...

01:30.765 --> 01:34.043
Yeah, and use an electric tuner, pinpoint where the notes are,...

01:35.355 --> 01:38.731
...and you're on your way.
