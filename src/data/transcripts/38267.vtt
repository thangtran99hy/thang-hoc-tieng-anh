00:00.129 --> 00:01.533
And then, what's the next process?

00:01.738 --> 00:02.415
He will show you.

00:02.945 --> 00:03.820
Yeah, yeah, that would be lovely.

00:12.799 --> 00:16.000
He'd originally put snakeskin onto a block of wood,...

00:18.345 --> 00:21.279
...strapped it up really, really tight with nails,...

00:22.183 --> 00:24.317
...brought out this massive box of wooden wedges.

00:29.935 --> 00:31.008
So, what are you doing that for?

00:31.275 --> 00:31.974
To make it tight.

00:32.203 --> 00:32.925
To make it higher.

00:37.690 --> 00:38.429
How'd it go?

00:38.533 --> 00:40.143
I inserted little wedges of wood...

00:41.583 --> 00:43.991
...to try to make it higher and higher frequency.

00:46.245 --> 00:46.773
Did you enjoy it?

00:46.892 --> 00:47.248
Yeah, man.

00:47.984 --> 00:49.119
Do you want to see how you play next?

00:49.507 --> 00:50.417
Yeah, I'd love to.

00:54.380 --> 00:55.941
I've learned how to make them.

00:56.315 --> 00:57.659
Now, I'm going to learn how to play them.
