Reading manga expectations:

00:05.045 --> 00:05.940
This is Ben.

00:06.229 --> 00:08.739
He is a careful and methodical guy.

00:09.273 --> 00:13.447
He always keeps his work calendar up-to-date and always responds to emails.

00:13.583 --> 00:17.611
He has a 401-K and is also considered an elite Yelper.

00:17.983 --> 00:21.179
He never starts a manga series he knows he can't finish...

00:21.253 --> 00:24.531
...and always sets up his space for optimal reading.

00:25.263 --> 00:28.969
He makes sure he always has a hot beverage, clean reading glasses.

00:29.081 --> 00:31.217
He always makes sure to set a timer...

00:31.300 --> 00:35.185
...for the precise amount of allotted time to read his manga.

00:35.440 --> 00:39.870
He turns his phone on airplane mode to eliminate any possible disturbances.

00:40.180 --> 00:45.164
He always reads slowly and methodically to ensure 100 percent reading comprehension.

00:45.992 --> 00:48.831
Ben does not exist.
