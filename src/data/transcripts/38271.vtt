What makes a good controller?

00:03.329 --> 00:07.025
If I could answer that in a sentence I think I'd make a fortune.

00:07.298 --> 00:08.827
I think the jury is still out.

00:09.188 --> 00:13.226
My opinion is someone who is creative.

00:13.329 --> 00:15.617
And by that, I don't mean an artist, someone who can paint...

00:15.725 --> 00:17.053
...because I can't paint for toffee.

00:17.675 --> 00:22.053
But what most controllers can do is they have a can-do attitude...

00:22.787 --> 00:27.381
...and they have the ability to think outside the box and solve problems.

00:27.898 --> 00:31.099
I'd love to know what the secret ingredient that makes a good controller is.

00:32.363 --> 00:32.955
Do you know what?

00:33.399 --> 00:34.135
There isn't one.

00:34.791 --> 00:36.586
There isn't one ingredient that makes a good controller.

00:36.709 --> 00:41.159
And I think we spend a lot of time trying to focus on on what a controller needs to be.

00:41.248 --> 00:44.933
But everybody's got different strengths, different skills.

00:45.403 --> 00:47.863
And it's not so much about having that one key skill...

00:47.975 --> 00:51.361
...or that one skill set that you can apply.

00:51.772 --> 00:55.963
It's about knowing what your strengths are and your weaknesses.
