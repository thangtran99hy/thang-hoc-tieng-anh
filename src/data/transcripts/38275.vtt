00:00.305 --> 00:05.005
In no particular order, here are the top 10 most notable children's authors.

00:06.035 --> 00:09.309
Number 10. Margaret Wise Brown.

00:10.802 --> 00:15.350
Once, there was a little bunny who wanted to run away.

00:16.253 --> 00:19.879
So he said to his mother, "I am running away."

00:20.833 --> 00:25.756
"If you run away," said his mother, "I will run after you."

00:27.751 --> 00:30.754
Number 9. E. B. White.

00:32.635 --> 00:34.762
It's a beautiful medal, Wilbur.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.145
And you deserve it.

00:36.671 --> 00:37.987
Are you alright, Charlotte?

00:38.531 --> 00:39.990
You don't sound like yourself.

00:40.639 --> 00:42.680
I'm a little tired perhaps.

00:43.466 --> 00:45.223
But I feel peaceful.

00:46.084 --> 00:50.840
Your success today was to a small degree, my success.

00:52.691 --> 00:55.261
Number 8. Judy Blume.

00:56.141 --> 01:01.105
In my house, reading was something to be cherished.

01:01.352 --> 01:03.401
I mean my parents were both readers.

01:03.606 --> 01:06.215
They didn't know a lot about education.

01:06.820 --> 01:11.055
But they knew how important it was to read.

01:11.364 --> 01:15.223
And they never would have said to me,...

01:15.529 --> 01:17.225
...we don't want you to read this book...

01:17.505 --> 01:19.550
...because it was a good thing to read.

01:19.977 --> 01:25.497
And all of the books on the shelves in my house were available to me.

01:26.828 --> 01:29.074
Number 7. Laura Numeroff.

01:30.396 --> 01:36.304
If you give a mouse a cookie, he's going to ask for a glass of milk.

01:38.739 --> 01:45.029
When you give him the milk, he will probably ask you for a straw.

01:46.298 --> 01:48.804
Number 6. Beatrix Potter.

01:49.632 --> 01:52.968
I have not seen many rabbits moping.

01:53.419 --> 01:56.088
But when they do, their ears droop.

01:59.435 --> 02:01.632
Peter Rabbit was in low spirits.
