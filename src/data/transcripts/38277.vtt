00:00.372 --> 00:02.516
Our epic three-day journey across the island...

00:02.608 --> 00:04.985
...will take us 500 kilometers to Wakkanai,...

00:05.121 --> 00:08.168
...Japan's most northern town, and finally on to Cape Soya.

00:08.452 --> 00:11.393
As we battle through blizzards, colorful barns,...

00:11.697 --> 00:16.604
...frozen seas and scenery, both jaw-dropping and utterly bizarre.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.785
And because I don't want to freeze to death alone in a field,...

00:20.049 --> 00:22.952
...joining us on the trip is my best American friend, Pete,...

00:23.188 --> 00:24.894
...a presenter on Japanese TV,...

00:25.064 --> 00:28.201
...who promises to drive me insane along the way.

00:28.721 --> 00:30.991
But our road trip begins here in Hakodate,...

00:31.125 --> 00:32.887
...the southern tip of the island.

00:33.112 --> 00:36.151
In 1854, the city found its way to the history books...

00:36.431 --> 00:37.997
...by becoming Japan's first port...

00:38.127 --> 00:39.863
...open for trade with the West.

00:40.009 --> 00:41.427
And that legacy lives on today...

00:41.521 --> 00:43.227
...in its Western influenced architecture.

00:43.617 --> 00:45.701
It's here not too far from the red brick buildings...

00:45.813 --> 00:47.493
...that we grab a much-needed breakfast...

00:47.580 --> 00:50.338
...at the iconic seafood market before we hit the road.

00:51.351 --> 00:52.963
Oh, so it's 7 o'clock in the morning, guys,...

00:53.121 --> 00:54.827
...and we're at Hakodate Morning Market.

00:54.975 --> 00:56.401
Before we begin this long journey,...

00:56.527 --> 00:58.355
...I thought, get some breakfast, get some seafood,...

00:58.474 --> 01:00.180
...given that's what this place is famous for.

01:00.255 --> 01:02.057
And also, it's worth introducing you to the guy...

01:02.134 --> 01:03.287
...who's coming on the journey with us,...

01:03.445 --> 01:06.983
...Pete, my best American friend, probably.

01:07.508 --> 01:08.447
Thank you. I think you are.

01:08.609 --> 01:09.479
That's quite a compliment.

01:09.579 --> 01:11.039
I'm probably your only American friend.

01:11.604 --> 01:14.199
Um, Chris, I gotta say, we've been friends for many years.

01:14.478 --> 01:14.791
We have.

01:14.907 --> 01:18.249
We met in a video game bar in Shinjuku about four or five years ago.
