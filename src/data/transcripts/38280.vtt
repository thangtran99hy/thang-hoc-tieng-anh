On the 14th of April, 1912, with over 2200 people on board,...

00:12.407 --> 00:16.073
...the Titanic was on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic to New York.

00:17.108 --> 00:19.659
She was the biggest passenger steam ship of the day.

00:19.931 --> 00:24.061
In fact, the largest moving object ever created by mankind.

00:25.777 --> 00:28.625
Incredible luxury combined with great speed,...

00:29.049 --> 00:32.249
...Titanic incorporated two major safety factors in her design.

00:34.405 --> 00:36.306
The first was a double bottom hull,...

00:36.995 --> 00:40.011
...which protects the ship if it hits an underwater obstruction.

00:40.839 --> 00:42.678
The second were her compartments,...

00:43.033 --> 00:46.761
...which subdivide the interior of the ship to stop the spread of flooding.

00:48.933 --> 00:52.660
These and other design features gave the ship a reputation for safety...

00:53.209 --> 00:56.193
...and inspired great confidence in her passengers and crew.

00:57.188 --> 00:59.714
Some even called her unsinkable.
