00:00.163 --> 00:01.237
Now, on to our first sight.

00:01.554 --> 00:04.291
Tiananmen Square, named after the Tiananmen gate...

00:04.386 --> 00:05.959
...to the Forbidden City to the north.

00:06.452 --> 00:08.759
This is the world's fourth largest square.

00:08.885 --> 00:11.865
It measures 440,000 square meters...

00:12.002 --> 00:14.177
...and it's a great place to come and to just people-watch...

00:14.273 --> 00:15.759
...and take in the humanity here.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.872
The square is also home to several other important attractions...

00:18.999 --> 00:21.354
...including the National Museum of China...

00:21.567 --> 00:25.602
...and the daily flag raising and flag lowering ceremony...

00:25.727 --> 00:26.933
...here, at the top of this flagpole.

00:27.097 --> 00:28.385
If you want to see the flag raising,...

00:28.459 --> 00:31.467
...you'll have to get up early because it happens before sunrise,...

00:31.571 --> 00:34.358
...some days as early as 4:45 in the morning.

00:34.939 --> 00:36.649
Next stop is the Forbidden City.

00:36.852 --> 00:38.862
It was home to 24 emperors.

00:38.975 --> 00:43.372
It is the world's largest palace complex and has over 8,000 rooms.

00:43.672 --> 00:46.397
The main entrance is just to the north Tiananmen Square...

00:46.659 --> 00:48.897
...underneath the portrait of Chairman Mao.

00:49.227 --> 00:51.155
The palace got the name the Forbidden City...

00:51.263 --> 00:54.269
...because in the past, no one was allowed to enter or leave...

00:54.365 --> 00:55.931
...without the emperor's permission.

00:56.133 --> 01:00.787
But today, you can enter for the low, low price of 60 renminbi.

01:01.167 --> 01:04.461
Just make sure you get here before 4 o'clock to buy your ticket.
