00:00.759 --> 00:02.831
Not all food is good for us.

00:03.515 --> 00:05.399
There are foods that might taste nice...

00:05.819 --> 00:08.919
...but they don't give our bodies any of the nutrients we need.

00:09.327 --> 00:12.812
Instead, they contain high levels of fat or sugar.

00:13.898 --> 00:16.832
These are foods that we need to try to eat less often.

00:17.798 --> 00:19.744
Which do you think  are in this group?

00:23.173 --> 00:29.561
Foods such as sweets, crisps and chocolates certainly are.

00:30.040 --> 00:32.895
While these foods are okay to eat once in a while,...

00:33.229 --> 00:36.169
...they can be damaging to us if we eat too much of them.

00:36.909 --> 00:40.721
For example, too much sugar can cause a problem for our teeth.

00:41.233 --> 00:42.797
This is called tooth decay.
