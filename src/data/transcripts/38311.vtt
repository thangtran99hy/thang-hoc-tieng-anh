00:03.716 --> 00:06.412
Hundreds of skateboarders are expected to gather tomorrow...

00:06.531 --> 00:09.032
...in support of Black-led skate clubs across the city.

00:09.332 --> 00:11.005
It's called Skate for Solidarity.

00:11.151 --> 00:13.631
Tomorrow is a Skate for Solidarity.

00:13.983 --> 00:15.289
So, as skateboarders,...

00:15.431 --> 00:18.402
...we do feel a responsibility to look out for each other.

00:18.653 --> 00:20.544
Skate parks act as a crime deterrent...

00:20.747 --> 00:23.855
...because skateboarders are eyes on the street constantly.

00:24.185 --> 00:26.277
And so what that means for us is that we make sure...

00:26.365 --> 00:28.051
... that whenever injustices are happening,...

00:28.321 --> 00:29.903
...whether it's within our own skate parks...

00:30.115 --> 00:33.292
...or an abuse of power, we're always looking out for each other...

00:33.394 --> 00:35.841
...and making sure that one another are safe...

00:36.095 --> 00:39.664
So, this action tomorrow is a representation of that,...

00:39.899 --> 00:42.797
...of what we do and the advocacy that we represent...

00:43.101 --> 00:44.578
...in this city and in our skate parks.

00:44.751 --> 00:46.641
We really thought it'd be a great thing to do...

00:46.759 --> 00:49.057
...and we saw that change needed to happen.

00:49.369 --> 00:52.061
And this was a perfect opportunity to kind of jump on that...

00:52.524 --> 00:55.127
...and make a change in the world and do a good thing.

00:55.469 --> 00:57.805
I think the skateboarding community is like really...

00:58.648 --> 00:59.874
...we're all really accepting...

00:59.963 --> 01:02.218
...but still, in the skateboarding community, there is racism.

01:03.045 --> 01:05.443
It's not as bold as some other places but it's definitely there.

01:05.905 --> 01:10.007
And I think that just having the whole skateboarding community coming together...

01:10.140 --> 01:11.274
...would be a really great thing.

01:11.513 --> 01:13.957
And be influenced to kind of also donate....

01:14.069 --> 01:18.089
...to the different initiatives that we're doing, to Oldowan Blackboard...

01:18.175 --> 01:20.200
...and they're also trying to support skaters...

01:20.369 --> 01:23.594
...who might not have the opportunity...

01:23.709 --> 01:26.439
...to be sponsored and they're giving them that opportunity...

01:26.631 --> 01:29.817
...to be able to skateboard like the rest of us.

01:29.943 --> 01:31.126
And I think that's really awesome....

01:31.225 --> 01:33.310
...and it's just something that everyone deserves.
