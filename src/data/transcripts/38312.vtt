00:01.420 --> 00:06.319
Once upon a time, a tiger was trapped in a cage.

00:07.272 --> 00:09.249
The tiger tried to squeeze out.

00:09.805 --> 00:12.289
But the bars were too close together.

00:13.416 --> 00:15.963
The tiger tried to bite through the bars.

00:16.836 --> 00:18.307
But the bars were too hard.

00:19.275 --> 00:20.945
The tiger shook the bars.

00:21.465 --> 00:22.777
And he bit them.

00:23.269 --> 00:24.246
But it was no use.

00:24.401 --> 00:25.987
He could not get out.

00:28.587 --> 00:31.065
A man came strolling by the cage.

00:31.986 --> 00:36.117
"Please, let me out!" cried the tiger.

00:37.169 --> 00:39.437
"Oh, I cannot help you," said the man.

00:39.572 --> 00:42.611
"If I let you out, you would eat me."

00:43.537 --> 00:48.223
"Oh no, I would never eat you," promised the tiger.

00:48.572 --> 00:54.636
"Please free me and I will be your servant for the rest of your days."

00:56.191 --> 01:00.493
And the tiger cried and begged and the man listened.

01:01.416 --> 01:04.572
And then after a while, he felt sorry for the tiger.

01:05.263 --> 01:10.701
The man opened the door to the cage and the tiger leapt out.

01:11.292 --> 01:13.465
He did not say thank you.

01:13.702 --> 01:17.481
Instead he said, "You look delicious."
