Optics or the enhancement of our natural vision...

00:16.605 --> 00:18.804
...has been one of the biggest catalysts for science....

00:18.892 --> 00:20.517
...over the past 500 years.

00:21.049 --> 00:23.937
Interestingly, it wasn't scientific interest...

00:24.055 --> 00:25.692
...but more practical matters....

00:26.009 --> 00:28.191
...that led to the initial advancements in optics....

00:28.337 --> 00:31.305
...starting around 1440 when Johannes Gutenberg...

00:31.386 --> 00:32.840
...invented his printing press.

00:33.271 --> 00:36.462
In short order, books which had been a rarity,....

00:36.693 --> 00:38.843
...were now becoming a widespread phenomenon.

00:39.270 --> 00:40.571
All that new reading material...

00:40.659 --> 00:42.485
...meant more knowledge was circulating.

00:42.807 --> 00:45.654
But it also meant that more people were straining their eyes,...

00:46.192 --> 00:48.405
...likely as they read by candlelight.

00:48.766 --> 00:52.558
And while spectacles had been invented in Italy around 1286,...

00:52.923 --> 00:55.878
...the need for reading glasses increased substantially.
