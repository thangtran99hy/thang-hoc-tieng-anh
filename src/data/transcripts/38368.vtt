00:02.135 --> 00:03.815
The world has a way of changing.

00:06.205 --> 00:07.485
And we've changed too.

00:10.651 --> 00:13.000
There are moments that separate us.

00:15.563 --> 00:17.591
But we always come back together.

00:18.935 --> 00:21.028
We heard y'all need a little love out here.

00:24.955 --> 00:27.571
Y'all ever thought about the wild missions we've been on?

00:27.712 --> 00:30.274
We've taken out planes, trains, tanks.

00:30.394 --> 00:32.017
I'm not going to think about the submarine.

00:33.773 --> 00:35.763
And now we got cars flying in the air?

00:38.889 --> 00:39.407
Who is he?

00:39.905 --> 00:43.251
Jacob is Dom's brother.

00:46.043 --> 00:47.319
It's been a long time, Dom.

00:48.050 --> 00:48.727
Little brother.

00:49.969 --> 00:52.241
You always say "Never turn your back on family."

00:53.113 --> 00:54.508
But you turned your back on me.

00:56.653 --> 00:59.843
Now, your little family is in my world.

01:07.827 --> 01:10.630
Whatever is on you, is on us.

01:12.477 --> 01:13.922
He's got his own private army.

01:14.059 --> 01:14.506
We need help.

01:18.507 --> 01:19.422
No way.

01:21.578 --> 01:22.821
So, how do you all want to play this?

01:23.589 --> 01:24.055
Fast.
