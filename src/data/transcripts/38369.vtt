I'm a comedy writer.

00:01.217 --> 00:02.972
All right guys, very funny stuff.

00:03.099 --> 00:05.027
I also write for Broadway and movies.

00:05.216 --> 00:07.003
Why is your face suddenly bigger than it was before?

00:07.096 --> 00:07.435
Oh my god!

00:07.508 --> 00:08.517
Are you allergic to seafood?

00:10.466 --> 00:11.277
She doesn't have insurance...

00:11.367 --> 00:13.141
...and she really shouldn't be leaving him by herself.

00:13.309 --> 00:14.573
You daughter is going to be fine.

00:15.461 --> 00:17.286
Why did you tell the doctor that I was your father?

00:17.359 --> 00:18.722
I was a little loopy by then.

00:20.213 --> 00:20.889
Who are they?

00:21.981 --> 00:22.683
That's my family.

00:22.904 --> 00:24.909
If they're your family, why do you have their names written down?

00:25.758 --> 00:27.644
Charlie, you can't be alone anymore.

00:27.836 --> 00:29.113
If you ever need my help, I'm here.

00:29.332 --> 00:32.129
I'm writing something and I have to finish before my words run out.

00:32.646 --> 00:33.416
I'll take care of them.

00:33.538 --> 00:35.015
May I ask what your relationship is?

00:35.545 --> 00:35.810
I don't know.

00:35.918 --> 00:36.280
I don't know.

00:44.763 --> 00:45.413
Do you live here?

00:45.512 --> 00:46.125
I'm his friend.

00:46.203 --> 00:47.661
But your dad needs you right now.

00:48.043 --> 00:49.639
I mean, this young woman is full of surprises.

00:49.901 --> 00:51.518
This is no time for jokes.

00:51.618 --> 00:52.830
It's the perfect time for jokes.

00:53.962 --> 00:55.287
You funny old man.

01:01.199 --> 01:02.031
I want to have fun.

01:02.505 --> 01:03.297
I want to laugh.

01:03.773 --> 01:04.949
I want to not be scared...

01:05.348 --> 01:06.197
...and I want to write the book...

01:06.323 --> 01:07.725
...and I want to do all of that with you.

01:08.635 --> 01:09.508
Hell yeah!
