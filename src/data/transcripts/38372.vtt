If you've ever received an email that says "Join my network on LinkedIn,"...

00:06.711 --> 00:08.890
...you've probably wondered, "What is LinkedIn?"

00:09.249 --> 00:12.759
A simple answer is that it's the world's largest professional network,...

00:13.179 --> 00:16.257
...helping people find and share opportunities every day.

00:16.830 --> 00:18.355
But how is it relevant to you?

00:18.981 --> 00:21.909
Managing your career is just one reason to join LinkedIn.

00:22.270 --> 00:24.184
As you develop your professional profile,...

00:24.413 --> 00:28.047
...you establish an authoritative resource on your experience and capabilities...

00:28.176 --> 00:30.757
...that lets people find you when they search the Internet.

00:31.110 --> 00:32.630
In two minutes, you'll be up and running...

00:32.730 --> 00:35.274
...with the most important page on the web you'll ever have.

00:35.799 --> 00:37.885
Do you know what people find when they google your name?

00:38.239 --> 00:42.090
With LinkedIn, you'll have more control over what appears in Google results,...

00:42.409 --> 00:46.442
...and having a robust profile encourages people to approach you with opportunities.

00:46.983 --> 00:49.220
Many of your contacts are already on LinkedIn,...

00:49.383 --> 00:51.873
...and you can reconnect just by uploading your address book.

00:52.251 --> 00:56.554
This lets you stay in touch even as your contacts change jobs and email addresses.

00:56.932 --> 01:00.876
Your reputation is summed up by the relationships you've developed over your career.

01:01.366 --> 01:04.412
LinkedIn helps you maintain these relationships authentically.

01:04.657 --> 01:07.362
In addition, when you want to make new business connections,...

01:07.633 --> 01:09.997
...you can find people using LinkedIn's search tool...

01:10.216 --> 01:11.776
...then see who you know in common.

01:12.088 --> 01:15.567
This makes it easy to request an introduction from your trusted connections.

01:15.905 --> 01:17.651
You can also join a LinkedIn group,...

01:17.803 --> 01:20.092
...where professionals in your field discuss issues...

01:20.233 --> 01:22.351
...and solve problems related to your industry.
