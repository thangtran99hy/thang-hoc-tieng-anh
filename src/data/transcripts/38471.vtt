Hi, I'm Harry.

00:02.238 --> 00:04.969
I eat lots of fruit and vegetables to stay healthy.

00:06.020 --> 00:09.373
For breakfast, I often have egg and bread.

00:10.935 --> 00:15.944
I also like to drink milk. Milk makes our bones and teeth strong.

00:16.953 --> 00:20.101
For lunch, I usually eat meat and salad.

00:21.181 --> 00:24.557
My favorite vegetables are carrot and lettuce.

00:25.453 --> 00:28.809
For dinner, I usually have a sandwich or soup.

00:29.066 --> 00:31.929
My mom makes the best chicken soup.

00:32.735 --> 00:34.687
I don't like sweet food.

00:35.672 --> 00:39.917
I like healthy food. Healthy food is good for our body.
