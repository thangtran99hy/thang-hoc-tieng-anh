There are certain things you should avoid while writing your resume.

00:04.437 --> 00:09.155
For one, don't use templates of people who have substantial years of experience.

00:09.975 --> 00:14.910
You do not need to put in your postal address or mention outdated qualifications.

00:15.488 --> 00:18.534
Also remember, whatever the reason for your resume,...

00:18.898 --> 00:21.882
...it should never be longer than a single-sided page.

00:22.693 --> 00:24.717
You do not need to include a photograph...

00:25.092 --> 00:28.293
...unless you're applying in a country where this is a requirement.

00:28.855 --> 00:33.696
Although this goes without saying, do not plagiarize someone else's resume.
