Although there are many castles in Germany, there's none quite like Eltz Castle.

00:05.756 --> 00:10.102
It has been privately owned by the Eltz family since 1157.

00:17.229 --> 00:20.646
The Eltz Castle was originally constructed in the 11th century.

00:20.865 --> 00:24.035
However, additions and restorations have been made over the years.

00:25.493 --> 00:29.189
Unlike most castles, Eltz Castle isn't easy to spot.

00:29.653 --> 00:33.046
It sits off the main road, high on a rock within a low valley...

00:33.267 --> 00:35.261
...and is surrounded by a lush forest.

00:35.986 --> 00:40.115
Many visitors are drawn to the hiking trails surrounding the castle grounds.

00:41.791 --> 00:47.190
Thirty-four generations of the Eltz family have lived among the castle's 120 rooms.

00:47.517 --> 00:50.811
And since today, no one in the family lives there full time,...

00:51.052 --> 00:53.571
...the ancestral home is open to the public.

00:55.023 --> 00:58.569
Every year over 300,000 visitors come to see the castle...

00:58.727 --> 01:03.755
...and its armory, treasury and original furnishings that are over eight centuries old.

01:04.795 --> 01:06.789
Throughout Europe's tumultuous history,...

01:07.041 --> 01:09.978
...this enchanting castle was never invaded or destroyed.

01:10.411 --> 01:14.373
Its rich history has earned it a spot on the 500 Deutsche Mark note,...

01:14.723 --> 01:18.915
...making it a special sight for those who get to experience it in person.
