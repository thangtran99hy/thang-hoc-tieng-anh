00:00.050 --> 00:01.415
The silent brainstorm.

00:02.668 --> 00:06.457
This one is a great icebreaker for new teams brainstorming together for the first time,...

00:06.733 --> 00:10.583
...as it can be a little bit intimidating sharing your ideas in a new group.

00:11.377 --> 00:14.165
Silent brainstorming gives everybody equal opportunity...

00:14.261 --> 00:17.463
...and a safe space to come up with as many ideas as possible.

00:17.778 --> 00:20.733
Even if some people can come up with ideas faster than others.

00:20.900 --> 00:24.235
Everyone's ideas get the same amount of time to gestate before they are shared...

00:24.491 --> 00:27.659
...while providing a distraction-free environment for the thought process.

00:27.993 --> 00:29.067
So, how does it work?

00:29.485 --> 00:32.169
Gather your team and make sure everyone is brainstorming on...

00:32.271 --> 00:34.219
...and can see the same "How might we" question.

00:34.537 --> 00:38.525
Set a time frame for your session and make sure everyone can see or hear when time's up.

00:39.038 --> 00:43.291
In that time, each team member should come up with as many ideas as possible on their own.

00:43.722 --> 00:45.853
You can each use a different-colored post-it if you like...

00:45.988 --> 00:47.777
...and feel free to mute your team members...

00:47.884 --> 00:50.063
...in case they are less than silent while thinking.

00:50.600 --> 00:51.161
When time's up,...

00:51.350 --> 00:54.861
...you and your teammates should take turns sharing all the ideas you came up with...

00:55.068 --> 00:56.203
...one team member at a time.

00:56.706 --> 00:59.783
If you have similar ideas to someone who's already shared their ideas,...

00:59.924 --> 01:02.386
...you can immediately start clustering those ideas together...

01:02.483 --> 01:04.569
...to see if you can build on each other's ideas.

01:04.946 --> 01:08.215
Once everyone has shared, you can continue to cluster the ideas together,...

01:08.640 --> 01:12.119
...combine ideas or even add new ones if any come to mind.
