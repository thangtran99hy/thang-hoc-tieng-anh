00:01.651 --> 00:04.413
The first national Olympics team to arrive in Japan...

00:04.507 --> 00:07.737
...since the Games were postponed touched down on Tuesday.

00:08.026 --> 00:11.421
Australia's softball squad waved to the media before making their way...

00:11.566 --> 00:14.420
...to a nearly two-month training camp in central Japan.

00:14.820 --> 00:17.973
Everyone on their team and their coaching staff has been vaccinated,...

00:18.360 --> 00:21.584
...and officials say they'll be required to take a COVID-19 test...

00:21.785 --> 00:23.190
...every day of their stay.

00:23.509 --> 00:26.975
Before they left home, Australia's Olympic team leader Ian Chesterman...

00:27.199 --> 00:29.537
...said the squad was comfortable with Japan's protocols...

00:29.699 --> 00:31.757
...to protect them and locals.

00:32.029 --> 00:33.502
And I think that these athletes...

00:33.623 --> 00:35.665
...as well know that they have to take great responsibility...

00:35.778 --> 00:38.058
...for their own behavior as well; they're committed to do that.

00:38.482 --> 00:41.083
They're committed to not only look after themselves...

00:41.225 --> 00:43.737
...but do the right thing by the Japanese population as well...

00:44.110 --> 00:45.181
...and be ready for the Games.
