If you're going to create a successful video cover letter,...

00:03.930 --> 00:06.382
...it's important that you understand the steps involved...

00:06.863 --> 00:09.699
...and carefully plan what you're going to say and how.

00:10.281 --> 00:11.933
Keep it brief and to the point.

00:12.125 --> 00:14.685
A one-minute video or less is enough.

00:15.375 --> 00:18.320
Highlight the most important points the employer needs to know.

00:18.848 --> 00:20.134
Show your personality.

00:20.665 --> 00:21.604
Companies will hire you...

00:21.719 --> 00:24.260
...not only because you have the right qualifications...

00:24.530 --> 00:27.001
...but also because you're the right fit for the job.

00:27.571 --> 00:29.101
Practice reading your script over...

00:29.285 --> 00:31.458
...until you're comfortable with what you're going to say.

00:32.100 --> 00:36.201
And remember, you sound more natural by not speaking too fast.

00:36.737 --> 00:39.461
Use a room with good lighting to improve visibility.

00:40.221 --> 00:43.361
Rid the room of any items that may be a distraction to the viewer.

00:43.815 --> 00:46.773
You don't want waste paper or objects lying around.

00:47.719 --> 00:50.277
Dress appropriately like you would in a normal interview...

00:50.546 --> 00:52.207
...to make a good first impression.

00:53.123 --> 00:56.908
Sit in a good posture and if you're standing, stand upright...

00:57.292 --> 00:58.846
...without hunching or fidgeting.

00:59.758 --> 01:03.287
Show from chest up for a good view of your face and body language.

01:03.933 --> 01:07.341
Okay, setup is finished and you're ready to shoot the video.

01:07.667 --> 01:11.037
Firstly, introduce yourself and position you're looking for.

01:11.561 --> 01:14.740
Give a brief summary of your past experience and achievements.

01:15.293 --> 01:18.238
Talk about what makes you stand out in your current position,...

01:18.465 --> 01:22.434
...what makes you unique and why you're a terrific person to work with,...

01:22.695 --> 01:24.797
...why you think you're the right fit for the job,...

01:24.989 --> 01:26.963
...and why the employer should hire you.

01:27.357 --> 01:30.327
What value will you bring to the organization if hired?

01:31.229 --> 01:34.219
Finally, you close with a convincing ending statement.

01:34.515 --> 01:35.756
So, be creative.

01:36.175 --> 01:38.955
Make a video cover letter that stands out from the rest.
