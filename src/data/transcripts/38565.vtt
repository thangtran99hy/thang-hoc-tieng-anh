00:01.822 --> 00:03.133
First, there was the planet.

00:03.725 --> 00:04.640
And then came people.

00:05.182 --> 00:08.583
And for thousands and thousands of years, they coexisted happily.

00:09.123 --> 00:11.961
The planet and everything in it worked together,...

00:12.819 --> 00:13.454
...which was good.

00:14.018 --> 00:15.329
But it wasn't quite good enough...

00:15.865 --> 00:19.010
...because these machines used fossil fuels like coal and oil.

00:19.607 --> 00:22.639
And fossil fuels release lots of carbon into the atmosphere.

00:23.320 --> 00:24.968
And lots of carbon in the atmosphere...

00:25.243 --> 00:26.928
...is the main cause of climate change.

00:28.047 --> 00:30.189
So, people looked for a different kind of energy,...

00:31.488 --> 00:35.725
...inventing smart new ways to move, store and generate carbon-free energy.

00:36.215 --> 00:39.412
The kind of inventing that gets people at Google very excited.

00:40.526 --> 00:43.565
So, that's our plan: to be the first major company in the world...

00:43.712 --> 00:47.563
...to run on carbon-free energy by 2030, which is good.

00:48.077 --> 00:52.402
But it isn't quite good enough, because it takes much more than just one company...

00:52.578 --> 00:54.108
...to create a carbon-free future.

00:54.692 --> 00:57.513
That's why we're using our technology to help other companies....

00:57.679 --> 01:00.713
...and governments and institutions everywhere become carbon-free.

01:01.169 --> 01:04.159
And we're giving billions of people access to tools and information...

01:04.239 --> 01:05.897
...to lead a more carbon-free life.

01:06.749 --> 01:09.921
So that for thousands of years to come, people and planet...

01:10.115 --> 01:11.379
...can coexist happily.

01:11.914 --> 01:16.161
The planet and everything in it working together again.
