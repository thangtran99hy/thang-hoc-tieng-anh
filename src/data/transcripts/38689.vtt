00:00.225 --> 00:04.403
So, do you like living in the country or in the city?

00:05.869 --> 00:08.341
I like to live in the city.

00:09.571 --> 00:10.171
Why?

00:10.835 --> 00:12.763
The city is exciting!

00:13.627 --> 00:16.079
It has more culture than the country.

00:16.649 --> 00:19.243
There are many museums and restaurants.

00:19.885 --> 00:23.039
Every night, there's theater and music...

00:23.778 --> 00:26.235
...and there are more jobs.

00:26.768 --> 00:28.424
That is why I'm here.

00:29.711 --> 00:32.143
Well, I agree.

00:32.956 --> 00:37.543
There is more culture in the city and there might be more jobs.

00:38.387 --> 00:40.554
But the country has more nature!

00:40.892 --> 00:43.731
It's peaceful and beautiful.

00:44.502 --> 00:47.518
There are more trees and mountains.

00:48.372 --> 00:49.703
The air is clean.

00:50.122 --> 00:52.574
You can go hiking and camping.

00:53.570 --> 00:55.739
The city is not beautiful.

00:56.347 --> 00:59.098
It's noisy and dirty.

00:59.365 --> 01:00.827
I disagree.

01:01.207 --> 01:04.867
I think all the different buildings are beautiful.

01:05.447 --> 01:08.639
And I like to watch all the different people.
