People in the country are friendly.

00:04.159 --> 00:05.613
They always say "Hello!"

00:06.389 --> 00:08.795
Here, no one says "Hello."

00:09.896 --> 00:12.841
I think city people are rude.

00:13.578 --> 00:14.861
Well, I agree.

00:15.199 --> 00:17.112
Country people are friendly.

00:18.136 --> 00:20.974
But I don't think city people are rude.

00:21.605 --> 00:23.108
I think they're just busy.

00:23.918 --> 00:25.091
That's a good point.

00:25.684 --> 00:26.529
Look at me.

00:26.758 --> 00:29.667
I live in the city and I said "Hello" to you.

00:30.129 --> 00:32.291
But you are from the country.

00:32.829 --> 00:34.037
I have an idea.

00:35.155 --> 00:40.251
Let's say "Hello!" to people, to many people.

00:40.697 --> 00:41.223
What?

00:41.591 --> 00:42.122
Why?

00:42.481 --> 00:48.036
Well, if we say "Hello," then they will say "Hello" to other people. Hello!

00:48.879 --> 00:51.536
And they will say "Hello" to more people!

00:52.207 --> 00:53.617
That's a great idea!
