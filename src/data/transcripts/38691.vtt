00:00.883 --> 00:03.941
So, Amy, I hear you want to go to university next year.

00:04.209 --> 00:06.265
Well, I'm not sure I do now.

00:06.687 --> 00:09.730
The fees are really high and I can't afford it.

00:10.323 --> 00:12.746
But anyway, I don't think I should have to pay.

00:12.992 --> 00:15.102
I think university should be free for everybody.

00:15.497 --> 00:16.005
Hmmm.

00:16.557 --> 00:18.363
Well, that's one way of looking at it.

00:19.258 --> 00:20.473
What do you think, Jackie?

00:20.823 --> 00:21.805
I agree with Amy.

00:22.432 --> 00:23.442
Schools are free.

00:23.715 --> 00:25.217
So, why aren't universities?

00:25.733 --> 00:27.703
That's why we pay our taxes, isn't it?

00:28.164 --> 00:30.243
I think all education should be free.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.399
I'm not sure about that.

00:32.798 --> 00:37.309
Everyone knows graduates get better jobs which means they get higher salaries.

00:37.833 --> 00:40.404
So, I think they should pay something for their education.

00:41.039 --> 00:41.886
I'm sorry.

00:42.307 --> 00:43.377
I don't agree.

00:43.922 --> 00:46.441
We didn't have to pay university fees, Matt.

00:46.772 --> 00:47.981
So, why should Amy?

00:48.375 --> 00:51.812
That's true, but we were at university a long time ago.

00:52.290 --> 00:54.325
Yeah, about 50 years ago, wasn't it?

00:54.555 --> 00:55.834
Not quite that long.
