00:00.846 --> 00:01.633
Okay.

00:02.002 --> 00:02.627
Be honest.

00:03.053 --> 00:03.701
What do you think?

00:04.421 --> 00:06.367
Well, you're definitely on the right track. So, well done.

00:06.971 --> 00:10.949
Your content is very clear and you maintain a good structure all the way through.

00:11.240 --> 00:11.891
Thanks.

00:12.747 --> 00:16.125
My first suggestion would be maybe to make it shorter, a bit more punchy.

00:16.494 --> 00:17.315
Is it too long?

00:17.736 --> 00:21.038
Well, there's some repetition in it and there may be material in here...

00:21.119 --> 00:22.509
...that this audience doesn't need to know about.

00:23.083 --> 00:23.785
Like what?

00:24.387 --> 00:25.923
Why don't I mark it up on your script?

00:26.351 --> 00:27.532
And then you can have the final say.

00:28.977 --> 00:29.447
Great!

00:29.749 --> 00:30.158
Thanks!

00:31.741 --> 00:35.835
If you make the presentation shorter, you won't have to learn it word for word.

00:36.257 --> 00:37.798
Have you considered using cue cards?

00:37.880 --> 00:38.628
They're really helpful.

00:39.295 --> 00:40.313
What are they?

00:41.047 --> 00:44.979
Instead of using a script, just write down a few key words,...

00:45.108 --> 00:47.746
...phrases on a card and they remind you as to what comes next.

00:48.332 --> 00:49.978
Cue cards, they keep you on track,...

00:50.370 --> 00:52.019
...help you structure your presentation.

00:52.790 --> 00:53.677
Brilliant!

00:54.338 --> 00:55.676
It'll give you confidence.

00:56.217 --> 01:00.403
It works like a safety net, so if you're not sure what comes next, you just look at the cards.

01:01.225 --> 01:02.333
I can see that.

01:03.824 --> 01:05.401
It allows you to focus on the audience,...

01:05.674 --> 01:07.303
...so you're not always looking down at the page.

01:08.133 --> 01:09.393
That sounds scary.

01:09.993 --> 01:11.980
Try to make eye contact and always be yourself.

01:12.472 --> 01:15.625
It will make people feel like they're more comfortable...

01:15.907 --> 01:18.119
...and they will be more responsive to what it is you're trying to say.

01:18.637 --> 01:20.209
This is really helpful.

01:20.428 --> 01:21.638
Thank you, Mateo.
