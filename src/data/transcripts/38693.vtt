Good morning, everyone.

00:02.954 --> 00:04.249
I'm Rosie Martinez,...

00:04.727 --> 00:08.795
...one of the new product development team here at Green & Pleasant.

00:09.974 --> 00:13.943
Let me begin by saying how thrilled we are this morning...

00:14.359 --> 00:17.248
...to be sharing with you the launch of what we believe...

00:17.456 --> 00:19.916
...to be an exceptional new product.

00:21.229 --> 00:28.555
I'm referring, of course, to the long-awaited, best of both worlds vegetarian range.

00:28.876 --> 00:33.167
And please allow me to tell you why I'm so excited.

00:35.015 --> 00:38.241
Like many of you, I travel to Europe every summer.

00:38.625 --> 00:43.283
And I get to try all sorts of local, authentic dishes.

00:44.463 --> 00:47.581
Then I get back home and I wish I could eat them all over again.

00:49.019 --> 00:54.712
Well, this new authentic range, locally sourced dishes...

00:55.053 --> 01:01.888
...from Spain, Portugal and Italy will allow your customers to do just that.

01:03.031 --> 01:06.536
But now, I can hear the sounds of stomachs rumbling...

01:07.064 --> 01:11.303
...so I'll stop and allow you to eat some really great food.

01:11.593 --> 01:12.387
Thank you for listening.

01:12.833 --> 01:17.257
And please come forward and try our exciting new dishes for yourself.
