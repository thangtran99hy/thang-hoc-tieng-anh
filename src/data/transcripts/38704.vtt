A team of nine South African students and young professionals...

00:04.525 --> 00:07.091
...won the first My Clean Green Home,...

00:07.505 --> 00:09.649
...a local building and design competition.

00:10.053 --> 00:12.815
The contest challenged designers to build a house...

00:12.954 --> 00:18.529
...that produced no carbon emissions with a budget of just 12,000 dollars.

00:18.745 --> 00:23.857
It's a good way to bring what we believe and what we study to the general public,...

00:24.408 --> 00:29.559
...and to actually share this with the city of Cape Town and the festival...

00:29.722 --> 00:34.094
...to actually educate people more about net-zero carbon buildings.

00:34.290 --> 00:37.377
Despite the small size, just seven square meters,...

00:37.815 --> 00:39.904
...the house quality surprised the public.

00:40.392 --> 00:42.488
Being green is always expensive,...

00:43.204 --> 00:45.658
...so it can't be rolled out to everybody,...

00:45.749 --> 00:51.355
...but if this is sustainably, economically viable, then it makes a lot of sense.

00:51.826 --> 00:57.029
Cape Town authorities say buildings consume 38 percent of the city's energy...

00:57.263 --> 01:01.665
...and generate 58% of its carbon emissions.

01:02.078 --> 01:07.301
They aim to have all new city buildings carbon neutral from 2030.
