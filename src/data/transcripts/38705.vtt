00:06.695 --> 00:10.907
...for its COVID-19 antibody cocktail as a preventative treatment...

00:11.264 --> 00:14.944
...after it helped cut the risk of symptomatic infections in households...

00:15.181 --> 00:16.803
...where someone else is ill.

00:16.980 --> 00:19.579

00:47.315 --> 00:49.680
...for patients with mild to moderate COVID...

00:50.056 --> 00:52.183
...and the companies are hoping the latest trials...
