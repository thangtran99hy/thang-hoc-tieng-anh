Say hello to the new iMac.

00:02.796 --> 00:04.811
You've never seen a computer like this before.

00:06.164 --> 00:07.520
Yeah, it's really that thin,...

00:07.952 --> 00:08.753
...but it's not magic.

00:09.141 --> 00:11.944
It's the M1 chip, which is kind of magic,...

00:12.739 --> 00:14.643
...and it makes the new iMac fast,...

00:15.033 --> 00:17.185
...like your apps open instantly fast,...

00:17.868 --> 00:19.920
...like check that text while you clean your inbox...

00:20.054 --> 00:20.776
...while you share that photo...

00:20.851 --> 00:22.325
...while you stream that show fast.

00:22.469 --> 00:23.275
That's fast.

00:24.301 --> 00:26.327
It has a 4.5K retina display...

00:27.273 --> 00:29.055
...for colors that pop off the screen;...

00:30.438 --> 00:34.925
...a 1080p camera so you'll look right in any light.

00:36.451 --> 00:39.375
And whether you're talking to one person or a hundred,...

00:39.697 --> 00:41.433
...the mic's always focussed on your voice.

00:42.144 --> 00:43.941
So they hear you, not what's around you.

00:45.412 --> 00:49.327
Six speakers and Dolby Atmos means everything you do sounds great,...

00:50.473 --> 00:51.937
...matching keyboard and mouse,...

00:52.213 --> 00:53.457
...and wireless Touch ID.

00:53.764 --> 00:54.224
Boom.

00:54.722 --> 00:55.135
Boom.

00:55.614 --> 00:55.973
Boom.

00:56.676 --> 00:59.899
And what happens on your iPhone also happens on your iMac.

01:00.305 --> 01:01.953
That's definitely magic.

01:02.785 --> 01:04.565
This is the new iMac.

01:05.785 --> 01:06.989
Oh wait, I forgot!

01:07.401 --> 01:08.634
It comes in seven colors.
