The fire lookout is a structure that sits on top of a mountain or ridge-top...

00:06.444 --> 00:09.162
...that has a good view of the surrounding country...

00:09.959 --> 00:12.426
...and the staffer, then, is tasked with living there...

00:12.605 --> 00:15.354
...for extended periods to watch for fire.

00:16.102 --> 00:18.431
It's funny, 'cause I get a lot of questions about the standard day.

00:18.806 --> 00:19.712
You wake up with the sun.

00:19.862 --> 00:24.861
I mean, it's hard to sleep in a room of glass much beyond sunrise.

00:25.217 --> 00:26.940
First thing I'll do is make a cup of coffee.

00:31.309 --> 00:33.691
And usually I'll have that first cup of coffee on the front porch,...

00:34.346 --> 00:36.323
...sit out there, watch the sun come up.

00:36.701 --> 00:38.293
Certainly every morning I go out for a walk.

00:46.769 --> 00:50.514
I think the solitary nature, when there's really no fires going,...

00:50.657 --> 00:53.491
...the only thing I might do is check in on the radio twice a day.

00:53.561 --> 00:56.498
That might be the only time I really talk unless I'm talking to myself.

00:58.963 --> 01:01.832
I think what's so tricky sometimes talking about the lookout experience,...

01:01.888 --> 01:04.759
...is you're not talking to anybody about it.

01:04.852 --> 01:07.553
So you more intuit it, you more experience it.

01:07.752 --> 01:09.949
I think that's why I always use the term "resonance"...

01:10.009 --> 01:12.216
...because you just can feel it and sense it.

01:12.369 --> 01:16.504
Maybe that's fanciful but it certainly is the way I feel about it.

01:16.629 --> 01:18.715
You know you just find yourself sitting on the porch...

01:18.801 --> 01:20.900
...watching the world go by for hours on end.

01:20.946 --> 01:22.312
It's beautiful.

01:27.691 --> 01:30.105
When you look at the lifestyle of a fire lookout,...

01:30.233 --> 01:33.561
...it can be a hard choice at times, too; I'm missing a wedding tonight.

01:34.273 --> 01:36.969
Over the course of the summer, you might miss a lot of stuff in your life.

01:37.417 --> 01:41.680
But certainly every summer I keep coming back because living on top of a mountain...

01:41.915 --> 01:46.439
...for days on end, is just such a beautiful chance at making a life of it.
