00:02.493 --> 00:04.477
An American hero is on that train.

00:04.958 --> 00:07.073
Her name? Kate Warne.

00:07.968 --> 00:10.095
She was the first woman detective in the US,...

00:10.217 --> 00:14.012
...and on that very train she saved Abraham Lincoln's life.

00:21.921 --> 00:25.330
When Kate Warne applied for a position in the Pinkerton Detective Agency,...

00:25.483 --> 00:27.246
...the detectives tried to turn her away.

00:27.563 --> 00:29.772
They didn't think a woman could do the job.

00:30.596 --> 00:34.298
Kate argued the women can be very good at uncovering secrets.

00:35.023 --> 00:38.585
She won the men over and became America's first female detective.

00:39.627 --> 00:43.775
She proved to be a gifted investigator, working many cases and going undercover...

00:43.789 --> 00:45.650
...in the years leading up to the Civil War.

00:47.859 --> 00:50.147
In disguise as a rich southern socialite,...

00:50.217 --> 00:53.909
...Kate uncovered a plot to assassinate newly-elected Abraham Lincoln.

00:56.172 --> 01:00.041
The killers planned to intercept him along the train route on his way to take office.

01:01.264 --> 01:05.385
Kate and her agency worked with the president-elect to carry out a daring plan.

01:07.254 --> 01:08.820
After a dinner in Philadelphia,...

01:08.903 --> 01:12.386
...Lincoln threw on a disguise and snuck to the train depot in secret.

01:13.436 --> 01:15.753
He met up with Kate, who posed as his sister.

01:17.480 --> 01:20.590
She had bribed the conductor to reserve the back of the train car to hide...

01:20.720 --> 01:22.974
...her and the undercover president-elect.

01:24.762 --> 01:26.185
The plan was a success.

01:28.391 --> 01:30.449
Kate stood guard over Lincoln while he slept.

01:30.605 --> 01:34.182
Neither his assassins nor the other passengers knew he was on the train.

01:36.045 --> 01:39.308
Legend has it, her watchful eye during that sleepless night...

01:39.425 --> 01:41.730
...is the inspiration for the term "private eye".

01:43.218 --> 01:45.546
American history could have forever been changed,...

01:45.609 --> 01:48.881
...if not for the first female detective, Kate Warne.
