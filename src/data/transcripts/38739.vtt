Mass incarceration means that we've got a very high rate of incarceration...

00:05.726 --> 00:09.783
...historically, comparatively and the other thing is the rate of...

00:09.868 --> 00:12.789
...incarceration is so high, so socially concentrated,...

00:13.284 --> 00:17.557
...that we're no longer incarcerating the individual, that we're incarcerating whole social groups.

00:19.346 --> 00:24.475
The rate of incarceration now is about five times higher than it was historically.

00:24.620 --> 00:26.760
Historically, it was a hundred per hundred thousand.

00:26.879 --> 00:30.222
Now, it's about five hundred per hundred thousand if we look at prison.

00:30.344 --> 00:33.789
If we add jail to that it's about seven hundred per hundred thousand.

00:34.984 --> 00:38.079
Nowhere in the world incarcerates as much as we do.

00:38.167 --> 00:43.625
We've seen extremely high rates of exposure to the criminal justice system...

00:44.037 --> 00:47.464
... for African-American men with very low levels of schooling.

00:47.900 --> 00:50.988
So, if we think about black men who were born in the late...

00:51.013 --> 00:56.465
...1970s and who are growing up through the American prison boom of the 1980s...

00:56.579 --> 01:01.813
... and the 1990s, the chances that they're going to serve time in state or federal prison...

01:01.862 --> 01:04.947
...if they dropped out of high school is about 70 percent.

01:05.357 --> 01:09.266
So, going to prison for that group of black men with very low levels...

01:09.367 --> 01:12.362
...of schooling, that's become a normal life event.

01:12.633 --> 01:14.910
That's really only happened in the last ten years.
