And finally, in other news, Amazon is getting into the beauty business,...

00:03.889 --> 00:05.852
...opening a salon in London.

00:06.197 --> 00:09.661
Yeah, the huge salon can hold up to 5,000 people.

00:10.137 --> 00:12.723
It will initially be for Amazon employees only.

00:12.796 --> 00:15.557
Appointments for the public are expected to open in the coming weeks.

00:15.879 --> 00:19.213
Now, this comes as people in UK are struggling to find haircut appointments...

00:19.317 --> 00:22.413
...now that COVID-19 restrictions have eased a little bit.

00:22.673 --> 00:25.218
Guys, at every station, there's gonna be iPads...

00:25.346 --> 00:28.349
...where you can virtually try on hair colors and hair styles...

00:28.446 --> 00:32.698
...and then of course, buy any products you want right there at your chair.

00:32.861 --> 00:33.757
That is amazing.

00:33.841 --> 00:35.683
You might be able to read a book there,...

00:35.827 --> 00:38.711
...drop off a package, get a blowout, there you go.

00:38.896 --> 00:41.108
Amazon really is taking over the world.
