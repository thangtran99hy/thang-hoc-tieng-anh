K-pop.

00:00.999 --> 00:03.630
It's an undeniable global force of nature.

00:09.480 --> 00:12.839
Those synchronized dance moves, those flashy outfits...

00:17.087 --> 00:18.646
...and songs like this.

00:26.229 --> 00:30.287
The music gets fans all over the world on their feet and dancing.

00:30.702 --> 00:33.350
K-pop is so popular for a couple of reasons.

00:33.509 --> 00:38.508
One of them is it continues a long tradition of basically teen pop.

00:42.097 --> 00:43.951
Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys...

00:48.087 --> 00:51.367
... even the Bay City Rollers and people like that from the 70s.

00:54.976 --> 00:58.883
Something that they have done differently is the engagement with the fans...

00:59.000 --> 01:00.367
...and the outreach to the fans.

01:05.901 --> 01:08.434
The groups build fandoms and many of these fans...

01:08.620 --> 01:12.149
...embrace and celebrate a different culture and language.

01:12.324 --> 01:16.766
If a young fan starts learning how to speak Korean because of BTS...

01:16.853 --> 01:19.530
...or trying to figure out what some of their lyrics mean or whatever,...

01:20.007 --> 01:22.603
...that makes them feel that much more invested in them.

01:22.776 --> 01:24.850
Forging friendships in the process.

01:29.072 --> 01:33.307
The community they feel with fellow fans, camping out with them,...

01:33.418 --> 01:36.065
...bonding with them, leads to other friendships...

01:36.157 --> 01:39.563
...and most of them said "I've made so many friends because of BTS"...

01:39.968 --> 01:41.429
...and what more can you ask for than that?
