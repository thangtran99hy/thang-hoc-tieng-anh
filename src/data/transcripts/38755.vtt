With many of us home now, chances are your next interview will be done through a screen.

00:04.296 --> 00:08.413
It's really hard to make that connection with the interviewer,...

00:08.691 --> 00:12.416
...but one of the best ways you can do that is to present really well.

00:13.097 --> 00:17.245
So ideally, you want to have a nice, clean, simple background.

00:17.344 --> 00:19.653
Just a blank wall is perfectly fine.

00:20.023 --> 00:21.824
You also want to think about lighting.

00:21.989 --> 00:24.685
For example, if you have lighting behind you,...

00:25.014 --> 00:28.082
...you could end up looking like a silhouette on the screen.

00:28.211 --> 00:30.951
Ideally, natural lighting is the best,...

00:31.061 --> 00:33.451
...so if you have a window that you can face...

00:33.533 --> 00:36.245
...or a window to your side, that would be perfect.

00:36.346 --> 00:39.582
Also, if you don't have a window to provide natural lighting,...

00:39.905 --> 00:41.623
...you can resort to using a desk lamp.

00:41.886 --> 00:45.713
And you really want to have your camera at eye level with you.

00:45.869 --> 00:48.301
That way, you're not looking up at the interviewer...

00:48.373 --> 00:49.802
...and they're peering up your nostrils...

00:49.883 --> 00:51.532
...and you're also not looking down on them.

00:51.638 --> 00:54.540
If you just grab a couple of books and pile them up...

00:54.623 --> 00:57.582
...and sit the laptop on top of that, that is gonna raise it enough...

00:57.711 --> 01:00.287
...to bring that camera right at the eye level for you.
