Originality isn't something static and it's just there for you at all times.

00:07.837 --> 00:09.609
It's like inspiration, you gotta find it.

00:12.201 --> 00:15.001
I don't think the key is to look for inspiration.

00:15.380 --> 00:18.829
I think the key is to understand that everything is inspiring.

00:20.099 --> 00:22.524
You know, the design kind of breeds the originality,...

00:23.184 --> 00:28.068
...starting with a tool that's unique lends itself to making unique things.

00:29.787 --> 00:31.570
Inspiration is a pretty strange beast.

00:31.871 --> 00:33.829
Is it inspiration or is it an extraction?

00:34.799 --> 00:39.578
Am I original or am I the sum of a lot of ideas that I accumulated over time?

00:39.933 --> 00:41.255
Why am I inspired by something?

00:41.353 --> 00:42.927
Why am I curious about something?

00:43.027 --> 00:44.322
Why do I feel this connection?

00:44.458 --> 00:48.706
Inspiration is just, it's that spark, and then all the rest is originality.

00:49.860 --> 00:51.449
Inspiration can come from anywhere.

00:52.396 --> 00:54.417
Originality is where you take it.
