00:01.335 --> 00:02.943
Step 5: Interview.

00:04.493 --> 00:08.124
It's inevitably going to happen that a distraction may come around,...

00:08.532 --> 00:11.071
...so don't ever panic when something happens.

00:11.472 --> 00:14.339
The more that you do or if you make a quick decision...

00:14.411 --> 00:17.643
...to turn off your audio or your video as a knee-jerk reaction,...

00:18.023 --> 00:20.086
...that could actually be more detrimental...

00:20.161 --> 00:22.032
...than the actual distraction itself.

00:22.471 --> 00:24.926
But if it does cause the interviewer...

00:25.013 --> 00:26.727
...to get interrupted with what they're doing,...

00:27.042 --> 00:28.293
...you definitely want to address it...

00:28.389 --> 00:29.819
...and not pretend like it didn't happen.

00:29.937 --> 00:31.447
You want to make sure that you're able to say,...

00:31.517 --> 00:34.715
..."Oh, my bad, that happened," and move forward after that.
