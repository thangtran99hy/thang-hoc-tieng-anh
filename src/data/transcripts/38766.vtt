When you're at home, even when you're on an interview,...

00:02.538 --> 00:04.964
...you kind of have that more casual atmosphere...

00:05.062 --> 00:07.850
...than actually going into an office building to interview,...

00:08.171 --> 00:09.538
...and with that casual feeling,...

00:09.635 --> 00:11.152
...you might end up doing something...

00:11.236 --> 00:14.467
...that you wouldn't even think of in an office setting.

00:14.819 --> 00:16.483
For example, having your phone out.

00:16.849 --> 00:19.005
So, just turn it off and put it out of sight...

00:19.457 --> 00:23.239
...and make sure you have all of your internet browsers and windows closed.

00:23.371 --> 00:24.275
You don't need that open.

00:24.703 --> 00:26.421
Really, the only thing you should have open...

00:26.490 --> 00:28.090
...on your computer during the interview...

00:28.173 --> 00:31.112
...is the program that you're using to conduct the interview.

00:32.699 --> 00:35.640
Remote interviews and video interviews are a lot different.

00:35.779 --> 00:38.333
They really are, but as they become more mainstream,...

00:38.403 --> 00:40.789
...it's important that we adapt and adjust to them.

00:41.182 --> 00:44.271
That way, we can still continue on with our careers...

00:44.366 --> 00:45.406
...and making career moves...

00:45.520 --> 00:48.628
...and not letting the fear of video interviews hold us back.
