Today we'll learn about water pollution.

00:04.309 --> 00:06.489
Clean water is mandatory for life.

00:06.892 --> 00:11.238
When water gets polluted, it becomes unhealthy for everyone.

00:11.747 --> 00:15.589
Water pollution has become an increasing problem on our Earth,...

00:15.895 --> 00:19.039
...which is affecting human and animal lives.

00:19.641 --> 00:23.983
Water pollution occurs when chemicals, waste or other particles...

00:24.273 --> 00:28.106
...cause a body of water to become harmful to everybody.

00:28.532 --> 00:30.996
Let's see the causes of water pollution.

00:31.999 --> 00:33.351
Natural causes.

00:33.751 --> 00:44.940
Sometimes volcanoes, animal waste, algae, and silt from floods cause water pollution.

00:46.115 --> 00:47.451
Human causes.

00:48.052 --> 00:55.105
Some human causes for water pollution are sewage, fertilizers and pesticides from farms,...

00:55.620 --> 00:58.480
...wastes from factories and construction sites.

00:59.464 --> 01:00.522
Acid rain.

01:00.944 --> 01:06.529
Acid rain can turn lakes acidic and it kills fish and other animals.

01:07.377 --> 01:08.558
Oil spillage.

01:08.880 --> 01:11.609
Oil spills generally happen in the ocean...

01:11.931 --> 01:16.896
...and cause many devastating effects to animals, plants and humans.

01:18.005 --> 01:20.649
Let's see some effects of water pollution.

01:21.535 --> 01:23.377
Death of aquatic animals.

01:23.812 --> 01:28.096
It kills organisms like fish, crabs, birds and dolphins...

01:28.247 --> 01:30.737
...that depend on these water bodies.

01:31.703 --> 01:33.204
Disruption of food chains.

01:33.745 --> 01:36.543
Pollutants are eaten by small animals.

01:36.985 --> 01:39.907
These animals are consumed by fish and others...

01:40.114 --> 01:44.770
...and the food chain continues to be disrupted at all the levels.

01:45.202 --> 01:46.127
Diseases.

01:46.588 --> 01:50.191
Drinking polluted water can cause serious health problems.

01:50.820 --> 01:53.711
Let's see some steps to control water pollution.

01:54.650 --> 01:58.439
Always look for the correct waste bin for throwing waste.

01:59.316 --> 02:03.121
Save water, close the tap when not in use.

02:04.076 --> 02:08.887
Do not throw waste chemicals, oils and medicines in the sink drain.

02:09.875 --> 02:13.200
Do not overuse pesticides and fertilizers.

02:14.081 --> 02:17.019
Try planting more and more trees.

02:17.910 --> 02:21.389
Now you know a lot about water pollution.
