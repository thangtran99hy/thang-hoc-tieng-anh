In our neighborhood, I can do all my errands.

00:04.074 --> 00:09.597
Marsha, before we get ice cream, I need to return three books to the library.

00:10.118 --> 00:11.685
Where is the library?

00:12.257 --> 00:15.423
It is on this street on the corner.

00:15.665 --> 00:16.219
Awesome!

00:16.359 --> 00:16.964
Let's go!

00:19.670 --> 00:22.476
Marsha, I can return the books here.

00:25.235 --> 00:28.452
Anna, what are those in the books?

00:29.545 --> 00:35.067
Marsha, these are letters to my family and friends back home.

00:35.389 --> 00:39.016
Four letters! Is there a post office near here?

00:39.887 --> 00:43.444
Um, no. The post office is far from here.

00:43.894 --> 00:46.591
But there is a mailbox across from the store.

00:46.981 --> 00:48.308
Awesome! Let's go!

00:55.297 --> 00:58.087
Marsha, now I need to buy stamps.

00:58.207 --> 00:59.227
Do you have cash?

00:59.583 --> 01:02.207
No. Is there a bank near here?

01:02.801 --> 01:04.335
There is a bank behind you.

01:05.297 --> 01:08.494
Thanks, Marsha. You know our neighborhood so well.

01:08.618 --> 01:09.895
Now I have cash.

01:10.161 --> 01:11.369
I can buy stamps.

01:11.917 --> 01:14.139
That store sells stamps.

01:14.519 --> 01:15.353
Wait here.

01:17.492 --> 01:18.454
I have stamps.

01:18.688 --> 01:20.305
Wow, you're fast.

01:25.826 --> 01:27.056
Do you have more cash?

01:27.710 --> 01:28.264
I do.

01:29.833 --> 01:31.371
Ice cream!
