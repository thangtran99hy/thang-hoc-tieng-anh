Oh! Hi, Mike! How are you?

00:03.259 --> 00:04.726
I'm fine, and you?

00:05.524 --> 00:06.837
Oh, that's good.

00:08.413 --> 00:12.140
Oh! So, do you need my daughter Martina for a children's commercial?

00:13.457 --> 00:15.276
Oh, she will be wonderful for that.

00:16.952 --> 00:18.817
Well, let me tell you a little bit about her.

00:19.333 --> 00:20.743
She's a beautiful girl.

00:21.567 --> 00:26.471
She is ten. She is tall and she's thin.

00:28.099 --> 00:33.945
She has blue eyes and has blond, medium-sized hair.

00:34.237 --> 00:35.737
Uh-huh. Yeah.

00:36.345 --> 00:39.833
She's also a lovable, kind and funny girl.

00:40.461 --> 00:41.827
Yes, she's very funny.

00:42.047 --> 00:43.470
She loves to tell jokes.

00:43.878 --> 00:45.671
Uh-huh. Yeah.

00:46.463 --> 00:50.199
She also loves to skate, to sing and to play the piano.

00:51.317 --> 00:53.902
So, I think she would be perfect for your commercial.

00:54.469 --> 00:57.107
I'll be sending you a picture of her.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.975
Okay? So, I'll talk to you later.

01:00.263 --> 01:01.386
Take care. Bye!
