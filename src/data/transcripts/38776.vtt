00:00.469 --> 00:04.124
Turmeric ginger shots, elderberry syrup, vitamin C tablets.

00:04.433 --> 00:08.077
No one likes to be sick, so it's 100 percent understandable...

00:08.171 --> 00:10.264
...why we're all intrigued by products...

00:10.401 --> 00:13.358
...that promise to boost our immune system.

00:17.789 --> 00:22.222
The problem is that we often think about the immune system in the wrong way.

00:22.450 --> 00:24.792
We think of it like a muscle that we can strengthen...

00:24.927 --> 00:27.812
...by feeding it lots of antioxidants and supplements.

00:28.229 --> 00:31.327
But that's just not how the immune system works.

00:31.588 --> 00:35.717
While the immune system can be suppressed and can be less effective,...

00:35.979 --> 00:38.358
...for example, in people receiving chemotherapy,...

00:38.620 --> 00:42.832
...the reverse, strengthening the system overall, just doesn't happen.

00:43.083 --> 00:48.465
Our immune system is what protects us from the bacteria, viruses, fungi and toxins...

00:48.576 --> 00:50.833
...we encounter on a constant basis.

00:50.939 --> 00:53.929
It also plays an integral part in wound healing.

00:54.174 --> 00:59.959
It's an elegant network of cells, tissues and organs, all working together.

01:00.168 --> 01:06.263
You can think of the immune system in two broad terms: innate immunity and adaptive immunity.

01:06.515 --> 01:12.301
Innate immunity means nonspecific defense mechanisms, and this is our first line of protection.

01:12.455 --> 01:16.320
It helps fight off pathogens before they cause a problem.

01:16.457 --> 01:18.787
It's like a bouncer at the door of a club.

01:18.943 --> 01:23.387
The innate immunity keeps invaders out or neutralizes them shortly after entry...

01:23.523 --> 01:25.683
...so they don't start a fight inside.

01:25.893 --> 01:29.685
It can only recognize self, meaning what's allowed in the club,...

01:29.864 --> 01:32.761
...and nonself, meaning what's not allowed inside.

01:33.010 --> 01:37.041
Think the physical barriers of our skin, the hairs in our nose,...

01:37.297 --> 01:41.619
...the eyelashes that blink out dirt, even vaginal discharge that prevents infections.

01:41.941 --> 01:45.576
Now, if a pathogen does manage to get past the first line of defense,...

01:46.149 --> 01:50.424
...we have another layer of protection: the adaptive immune system,...

01:50.617 --> 01:53.779
...which is more complex and targeted than our bouncer.

01:53.953 --> 01:57.050
The adaptive immune system responds to antigens.

01:57.263 --> 02:01.089
Antigens are unique proteins on the surface of pathogens,...

02:01.230 --> 02:04.166
...which helps identify what kind of pathogen it is.

02:04.341 --> 02:05.403
Kind of like a name tag.

02:05.605 --> 02:07.940
Your immune system is constantly reading name tags,...

02:08.045 --> 02:10.941
...and when one is recognized as being on the "no entry list,"...

02:11.106 --> 02:14.700
...the adaptive immune system creates special immune cells to attack,...

02:14.919 --> 02:18.045
...which are specialized white blood cells called lymphocytes.
