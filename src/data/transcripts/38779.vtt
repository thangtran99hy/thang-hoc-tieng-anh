Well, I once went to London with my dad to spend a weekend there...

00:04.045 --> 00:06.831
...and the hotel room was extremely small.

00:08.001 --> 00:11.009
The information we'd got was misleading because on the web page,...

00:11.317 --> 00:14.305
... the photos of the rooms, they looked a lot bigger.

00:15.300 --> 00:16.757
In fact, they were so small that...

00:17.084 --> 00:20.321
...you could just about open the door without hitting the bed.

00:21.749 --> 00:25.506
It was really hot because it was the middle of summer, and it got really claustrophobic.

00:25.934 --> 00:30.254
So, my dad complained to the manager, but he didn't even apologize.

00:30.752 --> 00:33.387
We thought we deserved our money back and we were really upset.
