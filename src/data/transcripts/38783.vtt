Hi everyone, today we're reading "Hide-and-Seek Under the Sea".

00:09.422 --> 00:12.045
Red Crab is having fun.

00:12.807 --> 00:16.225
He's playing hide-and-seek with his friends.

00:17.137 --> 00:22.261
"I can see someone in the coral reef," says Red Crab.

00:22.979 --> 00:24.911
It's Purple Octopus!

00:25.400 --> 00:27.951
"Boo!" cried Red Crab.

00:28.488 --> 00:30.295
"I've found you!"

00:32.038 --> 00:37.189
Purple Octopus and Red Crab are looking for the rest of their friends.

00:38.493 --> 00:43.769
Red Crab spots someone behind the shipwreck.

00:44.877 --> 00:47.025
Can you see who it is?

00:48.353 --> 00:50.210
It's Blue Dolphin!

00:51.037 --> 00:53.339
"Boo!" cries Red Crab.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.987
"I've found you!"

00:58.360 --> 01:02.583
The sea creatures still haven't found everyone.

01:02.879 --> 01:06.235
There's someone hiding in the big rock cave.

01:06.673 --> 01:08.233
Who could it be?

01:09.161 --> 01:10.968
It's Green Turtle!

01:11.599 --> 01:14.088
"Boo!" cries Red Crab.

01:14.647 --> 01:16.625
"I've found you!"

01:18.651 --> 01:22.811
"We've found everyone!" cries Purple Octopus.

01:23.650 --> 01:27.562
"That was great fun!" says Green Turtle.

01:28.569 --> 01:32.358
"Let's play again tomorrow!" calls Blue Dolphin.

01:33.089 --> 01:36.569
"Goodbye everyone!" cries Red Crab.
