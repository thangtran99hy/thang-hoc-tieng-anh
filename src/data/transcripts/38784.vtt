00:02.742 --> 00:05.644
Hey Dee, are you okay?

00:06.029 --> 00:08.737
Oh, I'm sorry. Hi Chris!

00:09.421 --> 00:11.104
Do you feel okay, Dee?

00:11.692 --> 00:13.437
Yeah, I feel fine.

00:13.759 --> 00:16.079
I'm just tired.

00:16.587 --> 00:18.643
Didn't you get enough sleep last night?

00:19.236 --> 00:21.663
Yes, I even went to bed early.

00:23.779 --> 00:25.302
And you don't feel sick?

00:26.091 --> 00:31.923
No, just really run down, like I'm a toy and my batteries are almost gone.

00:32.319 --> 00:33.909
What did you have for breakfast?

00:34.398 --> 00:36.867
Oh, I didn't have breakfast.

00:37.531 --> 00:38.781
You didn't?

00:39.475 --> 00:44.224
No, I woke up late today and was in such a hurry that I totally forgot to eat.

00:44.640 --> 00:48.381
It was either find my matching headband or eat breakfast.

00:48.993 --> 00:51.606
I'm really looking forward to lunch today.

00:52.003 --> 00:53.232
Dee, that's it!

00:53.637 --> 00:55.073
I know what's wrong with you.

00:55.730 --> 00:56.298
You do?

00:56.796 --> 01:01.111
Yes, you didn't have a balanced breakfast and your body is tired.

01:01.703 --> 01:02.595
It is?

01:03.152 --> 01:14.743
Every morning, I have a bowl of cereal, a piece of fruit, orange juice and water.

01:16.763 --> 01:19.778
Yum! That sounds delicious!

01:20.230 --> 01:21.666
It's more than delicious,...

01:21.964 --> 01:26.001
...my body needs energy to get my brain going for a full day of learning.

01:27.739 --> 01:30.569
I do sort of feel fuzzy.

01:31.029 --> 01:34.044
It was really hard to pay attention in class today.

01:34.689 --> 01:38.401
Remember how you said earlier you felt like your batteries were run down?

01:38.995 --> 01:41.422
Well, let's pretend you're a toy car.

01:42.947 --> 01:44.525
I'm a cute car.

01:45.030 --> 01:48.633
Now pretend that your tummy is like the batteries for that car.

01:49.009 --> 01:51.683
When the batteries are empty, what happens?

01:52.222 --> 01:53.472
It stops.

01:53.980 --> 01:59.213
Exactly! Now when you have a full charge in your batteries, you can go for hours!

01:59.403 --> 02:00.633
All the way to lunch!

02:01.530 --> 02:04.421
When you wake up in the morning, your batteries are empty.

02:04.815 --> 02:08.852
In order to start your day right, you need to recharge with yummy fuel!

02:09.514 --> 02:12.777
Skipping breakfast left your batteries totally empty.

02:13.049 --> 02:15.352
Which is why you feel so tired now.
