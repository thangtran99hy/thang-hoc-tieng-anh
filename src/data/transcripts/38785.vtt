00:00.050 --> 00:01.467
Ahoy matey!

00:03.779 --> 00:06.732
Thank you for inviting me over today, Maria.

00:06.944 --> 00:09.278
We make a good pirate team.

00:10.978 --> 00:12.333
I'm glad you could come.

00:17.447 --> 00:20.152
I think I hit buried treasure.

00:20.355 --> 00:22.838
That's not treasure, that's trash.

00:23.425 --> 00:26.440
Actually, Peter, it sort of is treasure.

00:26.929 --> 00:28.110
What do you mean?

00:28.614 --> 00:30.014
Come on, I'll show you.

00:30.888 --> 00:35.420
It's a plastic bottle which means we can recycle it in this bin.

00:35.971 --> 00:38.521
But isn't that the trash?

00:39.807 --> 00:42.109
No, it's the recycling.

00:42.451 --> 00:46.983
See? That symbol means recycling not trash.

00:47.608 --> 00:52.449
You want to make sure when you put recycling away, you're putting it in the right bin.

00:53.218 --> 00:57.131
It might look like trash but has a very different use.

00:57.284 --> 01:01.197
Wow! it's almost like magic.

01:01.601 --> 01:02.735
It is magic.

01:03.107 --> 01:06.192
I'm gonna make sure I always recycle.

01:06.440 --> 01:11.127
I'll tell my mom we should get a recycling bin at our house too.

01:11.721 --> 01:14.859
You can also help out by using reusable water bottles.

01:15.136 --> 01:16.758
And filling them up again at home...

01:17.042 --> 01:21.760
...instead of buying water bottles you only use once and then throw away.

01:22.169 --> 01:26.081
Wow, helping the Earth is easy.

01:26.440 --> 01:29.919
It is! Now come on, let's keep digging!

01:30.061 --> 01:32.117
Maybe we'll find more treasure.
