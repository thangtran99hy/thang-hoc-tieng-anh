00:00.599 --> 00:04.481
Well, I was about seven, and we traveled by car to Benidorm;...

00:05.107 --> 00:08.401
...me and my family including my grandparents and my cousins,...

00:09.151 --> 00:12.422
...and we stayed in a hotel, and one morning,...

00:12.663 --> 00:14.063
...or two days before we were going to leave,...

00:14.896 --> 00:16.385
...my grandad looked through the balcony...

00:16.498 --> 00:18.379
...and asked my dad if he'd moved the car in the middle of the night.

00:19.148 --> 00:22.224
And my dad said, "No, the car should be there."

00:22.512 --> 00:26.163
And my granddad was like, "Well, it's not in the parking lot."

00:26.947 --> 00:28.493
So, my dad went down to look for it...

00:28.577 --> 00:32.118
...and they spent about three hours in the morning looking for it, and it wasn't there.

00:32.869 --> 00:34.224
So, our car had been stolen...

00:35.141 --> 00:38.264
...and so they went to the police, and because they were talking in English,...

00:38.337 --> 00:41.066
...the police couldn't understand them, so it was a bit of a mess.

00:41.169 --> 00:46.971
And we had to go back on a bus, which took about two days, so we had to leave early,...

00:47.615 --> 00:51.033
...and it was kind of a mess, and we never found our car.
