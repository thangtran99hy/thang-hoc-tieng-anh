WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:04.415
We were going to Puerto Rico from California and we had a layover in New York,...

00:04.842 --> 00:06.835
...and we got caught in a blizzard.

00:07.187 --> 00:10.328
So, we had to sleep in the airport the first night,...

00:10.418 --> 00:11.453
...and they apologized,...

00:11.543 --> 00:12.699
...but there was nothing we could do...

00:13.239 --> 00:15.887
...and we were waiting for them to get us a new flight...

00:15.962 --> 00:20.040
...and they put us in a hotel and, of course, we didn't pay for it,...

00:20.209 --> 00:21.977
...but it was extremely dull and boring...

00:22.163 --> 00:27.024
...and we were fifteen minutes from Manhattan, one of the most interesting cities.

00:27.580 --> 00:32.097
And well, we were all packed for a sunny, Caribbean weather...

00:32.179 --> 00:33.546
...even though it was Christmas time.

00:33.775 --> 00:35.500
And we had no warm clothes,...

00:35.673 --> 00:40.576
...so we couldn't go out in the blizzard and we stayed there for two days...

00:40.731 --> 00:44.543
...and then we slept a fourth day in the airport again...

00:44.631 --> 00:46.785
...until we finally went over to Puerto Rico,...

00:47.087 --> 00:48.847
...but the beginning of that trip was horrible.
