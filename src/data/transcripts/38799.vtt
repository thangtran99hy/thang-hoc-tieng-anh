00:02.241 --> 00:06.623
In the world of supercars, the Lamborghini Sian FKP 37 is unique.

00:07.273 --> 00:12.086
The dynamic lines, audacious angles, sleek curves make it so futuristic.

00:12.422 --> 00:14.950
And yet, it's still unmistakably Lamborghini.

00:16.620 --> 00:21.435
We spent over a year trying to recreate this in a 1 to 8 scale LEGO Technic model,...

00:21.675 --> 00:24.277
...working closely with the design team at Lamborghini,...

00:24.495 --> 00:27.671
...getting all the details and lines as perfect as we could.

00:29.443 --> 00:33.493
At the end of such a project, you're always thinking, "What more could we do?"

00:34.035 --> 00:36.233
"How can we keep this great collaboration going?"

00:37.068 --> 00:40.962
After speaking to the design team in Sant'Agata, Lamborghini's headquarters,...

00:41.323 --> 00:43.475
...we came up with the idea of going big...

00:43.758 --> 00:48.709
...and creating a full-size, 1 to 1 scale version of the Sian FKP 37.

00:49.460 --> 00:53.785
Though our car was always going to have the same green color as the 1 to 8 scale model,...

00:54.734 --> 00:57.804
...we felt it needed a touch of something special to make it unique.

00:59.784 --> 01:03.558
Here, the Lamborghini designers suggested using the skilled craftsmen...

01:03.626 --> 01:05.741
...who paint their cars to do something with ours.

01:07.479 --> 01:11.301
Watching the craftsman adding the layer of color to the LEGO Technic elements...

01:11.510 --> 01:13.193
...was like watching an artist at work.

01:15.981 --> 01:21.807
There is only going to be 63 Sian FKP 37s made and every one will be unique.

01:22.659 --> 01:26.035
The idea of making ours unique as well was difficult to resist.

01:27.143 --> 01:29.074
From there, everything moved quickly:...

01:29.584 --> 01:33.418
...the final builds, the small details, the test of the electronics.

01:34.584 --> 01:36.122
Our dream had come true.

01:36.615 --> 01:42.709
The full-size LEGO Technic version of the Lamborghini Sian FKP 37 was complete.

01:43.703 --> 01:44.397
How did we do?

01:45.274 --> 01:46.881
It's really not up to us to say.

01:47.337 --> 01:50.899
It's the LEGO fans and the supercar enthusiasts that will decide.

01:51.887 --> 01:53.091
But, we're proud of the car.
