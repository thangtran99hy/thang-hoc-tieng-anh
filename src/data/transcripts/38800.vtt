00:00.069 --> 00:04.631
Deep in the forest, in the river, lived a large crocodile.

00:05.249 --> 00:07.861
He was a very selfish crocodile.

00:08.607 --> 00:13.201
He didn't want any other creature to drink or bathe in the river.

00:13.807 --> 00:16.079
He thought it was his river.

00:19.525 --> 00:22.795
Every day, he shouted to the creatures of the forest,...

00:23.255 --> 00:25.186
"Stay away from my river!

00:25.452 --> 00:26.845
It's my river!

00:27.369 --> 00:31.282
If you come in my river, I'll eat you all!"

00:35.476 --> 00:46.124
So there were no fish, no tadpoles, no frogs, no crabs, no crayfish in the river.

00:46.873 --> 00:50.167
All were afraid of the selfish crocodile.

00:54.061 --> 00:57.386
The forest creatures kept away from the river as well.

00:58.261 --> 00:59.800
Whenever they were thirsty,...

00:59.906 --> 01:04.005
...they went for miles to drink in other rivers and streams.

01:06.955 --> 01:11.425
Every day the crocodile lay on his great big back in the sun,...

01:12.054 --> 01:15.410
...picking his big, sharp teeth with a stick.

01:17.873 --> 01:24.293
But early one morning, the forest was awakened by a loud groaning sound.

01:25.049 --> 01:27.350
Something was in terrible pain.

01:28.049 --> 01:32.953
The creatures thought that it was an animal caught by the crocodile.

01:35.369 --> 01:37.667
But as the sun came out brightly,...

01:38.040 --> 01:42.200
...they saw that it was the crocodile who was in pain.

01:42.771 --> 01:47.087
He was laying on his big back, holding his swollen jaw,...

01:47.647 --> 01:51.002
...and he was crying real tears.
