00:00.901 --> 00:02.729
The creatures drew closer...

00:03.384 --> 00:05.006
...but not too close.

00:05.511 --> 00:08.557
Some of the creatures felt sorry for the crocodile.

00:11.297 --> 00:13.475
"What's the matter with him?" asked a deer.

00:14.269 --> 00:16.169
"I don't know," said a squirrel.

00:17.119 --> 00:20.474
"Maybe he's going to die," chirped a bird.

00:21.235 --> 00:27.502
"If that happens, it'll be safe to go in the river!" grunted a wild pig.

00:30.389 --> 00:32.327
The animals thought about this.

00:32.994 --> 00:38.927
They hung from branches, they hung from vines, they buzzed in the air,...

00:39.521 --> 00:45.199
...and they shook their heads as they watched the great big crocodile in pain.

00:46.017 --> 00:48.258
No animal tried to help.

00:51.937 --> 00:56.740
Suddenly a little mouse appeared, sniffing the air.

00:57.258 --> 01:01.976
He ran along the crocodile's tail, then onto his tummy.

01:02.715 --> 01:04.957
The other creatures stared.

01:07.343 --> 01:10.637
"Look at that mouse!" chattered a monkey.

01:11.272 --> 01:13.528
"He's either very brave or mad!"

01:14.545 --> 01:17.993
"He's going to be eaten for sure!" said an iguana.

01:20.331 --> 01:25.359
The mouse crept along the crocodile's big neck and into his open mouth.

01:26.401 --> 01:29.570
There was a hush in the forest.

01:33.261 --> 01:39.335
The mouse got hold of something, and pulled and pulled and pulled.

01:40.057 --> 01:45.119
Then he put it on his shoulder and walked out of the crocodile's mouth.

01:46.215 --> 01:50.190
There was a loud cheer from the astonished creatures.
