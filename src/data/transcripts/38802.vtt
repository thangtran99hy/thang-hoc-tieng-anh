00:00.396 --> 00:04.806
The crocodile sat up and said, "I don't feel any more pain."

00:05.098 --> 00:06.162
"It's all gone!"

00:07.337 --> 00:10.085
Then he saw the mouse walking down his tummy,...

00:10.662 --> 00:14.977
...carrying an enormous crocodile tooth on his shoulder.

00:18.829 --> 00:23.207
"Your bad tooth was giving you the toothache!" answered the mouse,...

00:23.701 --> 00:27.335
...turning around to face the now smiling crocodile.

00:28.593 --> 00:29.935
"Do you want it back?"

00:30.633 --> 00:32.997
"Oh no, no, no, no get rid of it,...

00:34.309 --> 00:40.049
...and when you've done that, come back, I'll have a present for you."

00:40.662 --> 00:44.142
The mouse went and buried the bad tooth under a tree,...

00:44.787 --> 00:50.959
...and when he returned, the crocodile had a nice juicy nut waiting for him.

00:54.273 --> 00:58.805
As the crocodile watched the mouse eating the nut, he said to him,...

00:59.689 --> 01:04.871
"You were very clever, getting rid of my toothache, and kind too.

01:05.771 --> 01:07.393
I am so grateful.

01:07.863 --> 01:11.033
But what shall I do if my toothache comes back?"

01:13.920 --> 01:19.133
"Don't worry, I'll help you take care of your teeth," answered the mouse nibbling.

01:19.709 --> 01:23.838
Soon the crocodile and the mouse were the best of friends.

01:26.181 --> 01:30.372
And one day the crocodile sent all the animals an invitation.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.685
"Please come to drink and bathe in the river!

01:34.325 --> 01:35.695
I won't hurt you!

01:36.138 --> 01:39.245
"The river belongs to us all!" he said.

01:41.967 --> 01:46.376
The creatures weren't afraid to drink and bathe in the river anymore.

01:47.157 --> 01:52.328
Although the crocodile was sometimes snappy, they grew to love him.

01:52.999 --> 01:59.761
And soon the river was full of fish and tadpoles and crabs and crayfish.
