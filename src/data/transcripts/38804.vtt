Hi, do you have any chocolate bars?

00:04.459 --> 00:06.720
Sure, what kind are you looking for?

00:08.813 --> 00:11.137
I'm looking for one without nuts.

00:12.649 --> 00:13.477
Here you go.

00:13.974 --> 00:15.378
How much are these?

00:16.513 --> 00:18.896
That would be 50 cents each.

00:19.473 --> 00:21.851
I'll get six of them.

00:23.121 --> 00:25.786
That would be $3 total.

00:26.971 --> 00:29.130
Here's $3.

00:29.257 --> 00:30.113
Thanks!

00:32.799 --> 00:33.165
Hello.

00:33.279 --> 00:34.307
Could you please help me?

00:34.829 --> 00:35.713
I need some paper.

00:36.299 --> 00:38.157
What type of paper do you need?

00:38.755 --> 00:40.741
Some paper I could use on my printer.

00:41.049 --> 00:43.447
I have just what you need here.

00:43.905 --> 00:44.926
How much is this?

00:45.453 --> 00:46.765
$10.

00:47.245 --> 00:48.331
Here's $10.

00:48.505 --> 00:49.645
Thank you so much!

00:52.656 --> 00:57.217
Wow, that blue hat looks so cool!

00:57.771 --> 01:00.906
Yes, it's one of our latest styles.

01:01.507 --> 01:02.907
Would you like to try it on?

01:03.739 --> 01:05.654
Oh, I would love to!

01:06.679 --> 01:07.370
See?

01:07.505 --> 01:09.351
It looks good on you.

01:10.597 --> 01:12.111
How much is it?

01:12.506 --> 01:14.523
It's $40.

01:15.585 --> 01:18.640
Hmm, I'm not sure if I can afford that.

01:19.475 --> 01:22.224
I'll give you a $5 discount.

01:23.356 --> 01:24.167
Okay.

01:24.606 --> 01:25.360
I'll take it.

01:25.595 --> 01:26.399
Thanks!
