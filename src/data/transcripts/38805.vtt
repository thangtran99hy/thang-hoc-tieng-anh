00:01.339 --> 00:03.109
How do we go about putting this in perspective?

00:03.551 --> 00:05.271
Well, this has never happened before.

00:05.379 --> 00:10.055
Babe Ruth never got the opportunity to do quite what Ohtani's doing this year,...

00:10.142 --> 00:11.341
...but no one has ever done this.

00:11.467 --> 00:13.726
This is an unprecedented season.

00:13.797 --> 00:17.540
The most incredible season you could make a case than anyone's ever had,...

00:17.675 --> 00:21.015
...given he's made the all-star team as a pitcher and a hitter...

00:21.262 --> 00:23.668
...and the way he scored from second base the other day on the line,...

00:23.756 --> 00:26.007
...drive single to right was ridiculous.

00:26.578 --> 00:29.313
He is the greatest thing I've seen in baseball,...

00:29.395 --> 00:31.745
...and I played a long time, but yeah.

00:31.828 --> 00:34.957
I don't understand how you could be that good on both sides of the ball.

00:35.065 --> 00:36.063
Let's just start there.

00:36.497 --> 00:37.612
But it's not just the numbers.

00:37.707 --> 00:40.149
It's what he is able to do on the field...

00:40.223 --> 00:43.731
...that just makes no sense like inside-outing a ball, right?

00:43.844 --> 00:46.885
Normally, you carve it inside,  you maybe slice it over the shortstop.

00:47.287 --> 00:50.109
He's able to lean back and hit it for power in the opposite field.

00:50.445 --> 00:51.933
That's a defensive swing.

00:52.004 --> 00:55.446
That's a swing that you do like two strikes and try to slap it out of the glove...

00:55.529 --> 00:57.089
...and he does everything with power.

00:57.455 --> 01:00.348
So, you combine that with the fact that "Oh, he can throw 100 miles an hour...

01:00.414 --> 01:02.409
...and strike out major league hitters at that level."

01:03.038 --> 01:04.603
I've never seen anything like that.
