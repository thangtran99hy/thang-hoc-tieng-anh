Why are pizza boxes square?

00:08.865 --> 00:11.911
Because square is what's in right now...

00:14.227 --> 00:15.849
Hey you, come over here.

00:20.821 --> 00:25.121
Even though pizzas are round, square boxes are preferred.

00:25.449 --> 00:25.778
Why?

00:25.921 --> 00:30.732
This is because a square box is made using just a single cardboard sheet.

00:37.397 --> 00:40.330
While a round box requires several sheets.

00:41.856 --> 00:44.594
That need to be joined together using special machinery.

00:47.198 --> 00:50.987
So it is cheaper and simpler to make square boxes.

00:51.498 --> 00:52.219
Yes.

00:52.383 --> 00:55.199
A square box can be easily assembled on-site.

00:55.477 --> 01:00.611
They are transported in the form of flat cardboard sheets easily stacked on.

01:02.083 --> 01:05.439
However, round boxes need to be first assembled.

01:05.698 --> 01:10.354
This makes it difficult to transport and store these huge pile of boxes on-site.
