00:03.815 --> 00:05.994
What exactly killed the dinosaurs?

00:07.729 --> 00:09.474
My silly jokes.

00:11.164 --> 00:11.981
No.

00:13.050 --> 00:16.499
Most people believe that an asteroid killed all dinosaurs.

00:18.593 --> 00:20.100
But that wasn't the only reason.

00:20.975 --> 00:26.003
Dinosaurs were already declining due to volcanism, far before the asteroid impact.

00:26.409 --> 00:27.045
Really?

00:27.192 --> 00:32.491
Yes. Super volcanic eruptions spewed out lava, dust,...

00:32.592 --> 00:34.957
...soot and various gases into the atmosphere.

00:36.149 --> 00:41.371
This triggered a drastic climate change, slowly reducing the dinosaur count.

00:44.184 --> 00:47.073
Then around 66 million years ago,...

00:48.544 --> 00:53.417
...a 6-mile-wide asteroid crashed into the earth in the Yucatan Peninsula.

00:54.273 --> 00:56.746
Hold on. How do you know?

00:59.268 --> 01:03.088
Scientists found a layer in rocks, called K-PG boundary.

01:04.410 --> 01:05.919
It is rich in Iridium.

01:07.793 --> 01:12.449
Iridium isn't found on earth's surface, but is abundant in asteroids.

01:12.751 --> 01:15.302
Proving that an asteroid crashed to the earth.

01:18.196 --> 01:22.821
This caused large rocks to blast into the air and fall back as molten rocks.

01:23.085 --> 01:25.233
Huge tsunamis worsened the condition.

01:26.412 --> 01:29.026
Eventually making dinosaurs extinct.
