00:06.268 --> 00:10.939
Colors.

00:11.461 --> 00:14.724
Colors.

00:17.389 --> 00:20.369
We started with the color basics, let's face it, you made it.

00:20.515 --> 00:22.923
Thus far for a reason, now you're itching and you're racing.

00:22.997 --> 00:25.013
To learn more and more, so let's review.

00:25.096 --> 00:27.473
It starts with yellow, red, and blue.

00:27.625 --> 00:30.009
Yes, it's elementary, three colors: primary.

00:30.116 --> 00:30.642
1. Yellow.

00:30.739 --> 00:31.219
2. Blue.

00:31.354 --> 00:32.603
3. Red like strawberry.

00:32.751 --> 00:34.607
All the other colors come from these three, yo.

00:34.727 --> 00:37.983
But you need to learn more to be a true color hero.

00:39.983 --> 00:42.097
Now level 2, here's what you do:

00:42.211 --> 00:44.668
you mix red and blue, red and yellow, yellow and blue.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.190
Three new colors called secondary.

00:47.409 --> 00:48.139
1. Orange.

00:48.213 --> 00:48.710
2. Purple.

00:48.833 --> 00:50.229
3. Green like a tree.

00:50.537 --> 00:53.059
So now we have a nice color wheel of six, then.
