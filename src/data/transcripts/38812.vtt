We got soba noodles, we've got udon noodles, spaghetti, rotini.

00:19.814 --> 00:21.327
We also have a bunch of liquid goods.

00:21.439 --> 00:24.432
We've got oils and vinegars, kombucha,...

00:24.541 --> 00:28.315

00:28.443 --> 00:29.923

00:41.923 --> 00:45.604
The store is about 95% organic, non-GMO,...

00:45.821 --> 00:48.005
...and we try to source as locally as possible,...

00:48.082 --> 00:49.856
...but sometimes that isn't always possible,...

00:49.953 --> 00:51.118
...but whenever we can.

00:51.286 --> 00:55.297
We're still competitive with the packaged alternative.

00:55.809 --> 00:57.789
It often ends up being so much cheaper...

00:57.899 --> 00:59.742
...because you're not paying for the packaging...

00:59.829 --> 01:03.089
...and the advertising and branding that goes with that packaging.
