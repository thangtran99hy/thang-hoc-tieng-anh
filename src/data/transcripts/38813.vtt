How do bees make honey?

00:03.634 --> 00:04.409
No idea.

00:04.772 --> 00:08.319
To make honey, the worker honeybee sucks nectar from flowers...

00:08.395 --> 00:10.294
...and stores it in its honey stomach.

00:10.612 --> 00:12.726
Once the worker bee returns to the hive,...

00:12.929 --> 00:16.409
...it vomits the nectar into a processor honeybee's mouth.

00:18.820 --> 00:20.911
In the processor bee's mouth and stomach,...

00:21.189 --> 00:24.537
...an enzyme called invertase is added to the nectar.

00:24.785 --> 00:29.009
Invertase breaks some nectar into simple sugars like glucose and fructose.

00:30.420 --> 00:34.615
Then it vomits the partially converted nectar into another processor bee's mouth.

00:34.925 --> 00:38.344
Who also adds more invertase, helping breakdown more nectar.

00:38.669 --> 00:42.633
This process goes on until most of the nectar is converted into simple sugars.

00:43.145 --> 00:46.199
Then the mixture of simple sugars is stored in the honeycomb.

00:46.297 --> 00:48.876
At this point, the mixture is still watery.

00:49.181 --> 00:51.861
Hence, the bees flap their wings which evaporates water...

00:51.953 --> 00:54.473
...and thickens the mixture to eventually form honey.
