Older people tend to complain that youngsters are destroying everything they've built,...

00:05.197 --> 00:08.480
...and millennials are responding that they've been dealt a bad hand.

00:09.329 --> 00:12.354
But what are the actual differences between generations?

00:13.035 --> 00:14.981
Is there any truth to their stereotypes?

00:15.465 --> 00:19.823
One big setback that both these generations have been through: The Great Recession.

00:20.144 --> 00:23.451
While it affected both groups, this moment in history occurred...

00:23.534 --> 00:26.123
...when millennials were just entering the workforce.

00:26.652 --> 00:31.364
The young invincibles compared the earnings of boomers and millennials at the same age,...

00:31.656 --> 00:38.003
...adjusted it to 2013 wages and found that millennials earned about $10,000 less annually.

00:38.565 --> 00:41.180
All these changes transformed the way young people lived,...

00:41.521 --> 00:45.397
...their expectations, their workplaces and their homes.

00:45.890 --> 00:50.457
But how do all these changes affect personality and values that define each generation?

00:50.927 --> 00:54.713
There is some truth in stating that values or priorities have shifted.

00:55.129 --> 00:57.771
For example, marriage has gone out of fashion.

00:58.205 --> 01:01.120
Fifty-seven percent of millennials have never been married,...

01:01.376 --> 01:06.116
...and the age that young people get married has shifted by six years during the last 40 years.

01:06.441 --> 01:09.124
Millennials are less religiously affiliated, too,...

01:09.349 --> 01:12.923
...but the most common stereotypical image of a millennial and their values...

01:13.212 --> 01:16.477
...is a mobile memory packed with an infinite number of selfies.

01:16.829 --> 01:18.679
As new technology enters our lives,...

01:18.977 --> 01:22.241
...it's starting to get harder and harder to understand our similarities...

01:22.662 --> 01:25.558
...and you may feel that the gap between generations widens.

01:25.932 --> 01:28.889
But, as always, communication is the key.

01:29.334 --> 01:32.459
Not all baby boomers are lost when it comes to technology,...

01:32.758 --> 01:38.414
...and millennials actually understand English words, not only emojis.
