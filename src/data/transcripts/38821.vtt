00:00.319 --> 00:03.303
Consider this unfortunately familiar scenario.

00:03.913 --> 00:08.910
Several months ago, a highly infectious, sometimes deadly respiratory virus...

00:09.247 --> 00:11.271
...infected humans for the first time.

00:11.817 --> 00:15.730
It then proliferated faster than public health measures could contain it.

00:16.323 --> 00:19.771
Now, the World Health Organization has declared a pandemic,...

00:20.089 --> 00:22.232
...meaning that it's spreading worldwide.

00:23.093 --> 00:27.439
The death toll is starting to rise, and everyone is asking the same question:...

00:28.061 --> 00:30.058
When will the pandemic end?

00:31.070 --> 00:34.068
The WHO will likely declare the pandemic over...

00:34.246 --> 00:36.611
...once the infection is mostly contained...

00:36.804 --> 00:40.469
...and rates of transmission drop significantly throughout the world,...

00:41.306 --> 00:46.179
...but exactly when that happens depends on what global governments choose to do next.

00:46.568 --> 00:48.470
They have three main options:...

00:48.690 --> 00:53.563
...Race through it, delay and vaccinate, or coordinate and crush.

00:53.970 --> 00:58.440
One is widely considered best, and it may not be the one you think.

00:59.195 --> 01:02.953
In the first, governments and communities do nothing to halt the spread...

01:03.143 --> 01:06.654
...and instead allow people to be exposed as quickly as possible.

01:07.099 --> 01:08.712
Without time to study the virus,...

01:08.800 --> 01:11.289
...doctors know little about how to save their patients,...

01:11.464 --> 01:14.665
...and hospitals reach peak capacity almost immediately.

01:15.177 --> 01:19.589
Somewhere in the range of millions to hundreds of millions of people die,...

01:20.008 --> 01:23.363
...either from the virus or the collapse of health care systems.

01:23.916 --> 01:26.624
Soon, the majority of people have been infected...

01:26.726 --> 01:31.103
...and either perished or survived by building up their immune responses.

01:32.033 --> 01:37.970
Around this point, herd immunity kicks in, where the virus can no longer find new hosts.

01:38.381 --> 01:42.069
So, the pandemic fizzles out a short time after it began.
