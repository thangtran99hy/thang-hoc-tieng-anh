00:00.083 --> 00:04.460
But there's another way to create herd immunity without such a high cost of life.

00:05.123 --> 00:09.500
Let's reset the clock to the moment the WHO declared the pandemic.

00:10.144 --> 00:14.788
This time, governments and communities around the world slow the spread of the virus...

00:14.955 --> 00:18.403
...to give research facilities time to produce a vaccine.

00:19.081 --> 00:20.481
They buy this crucial time...

00:20.568 --> 00:24.914
...through tactics that may include widespread testing to identify carriers,...

00:25.421 --> 00:30.479
...quarantining the infected and people they've interacted with, and physical distancing.

00:31.897 --> 00:35.875
Even with these measures in place, the virus slowly spreads,...

00:36.057 --> 00:38.992
...causing up to hundreds of thousands of deaths.

00:39.189 --> 00:43.416
Some cities get the outbreak under control and go back to business as usual,...

00:43.652 --> 00:45.211
...only to have a resurgence...

00:45.418 --> 00:48.991
...and return to physical distancing when a new case passes through.

00:49.344 --> 00:51.203
Within the next several years,...

00:51.379 --> 00:56.880
...one or possibly several vaccines become widely and hopefully freely available...

00:57.057 --> 00:58.958
...thanks to a worldwide effort.

00:59.425 --> 01:02.967
Once 40 to 90% of the population has received it,...

01:03.195 --> 01:05.653
...the precise amount varying based on the virus,...

01:05.973 --> 01:10.195
...herd immunity kicks in, and the pandemic fizzles out.

01:11.290 --> 01:15.203
Let's rewind the clock one more time, to consider the final strategy:...

01:15.774 --> 01:17.262
...coordinate and crush.

01:17.814 --> 01:22.222
The idea here is to simultaneously starve the virus everywhere...

01:22.495 --> 01:27.027
...through a combination of quarantine, social distancing and restricting travel.

01:27.481 --> 01:30.526
The critical factor is to synchronize responses.

01:30.935 --> 01:33.826
In a typical pandemic, when one country is peaking,...

01:33.964 --> 01:36.329
...another may be getting its first cases.

01:36.975 --> 01:40.949
Instead of every leader responding to what's happening in their jurisdiction,...

01:41.353 --> 01:46.412
...here, everyone must treat the world as the giant interconnected system it is.

01:46.985 --> 01:51.703
If coordinated properly, this could end a pandemic in just a few months...

01:52.017 --> 01:53.577
...with low loss of life.
