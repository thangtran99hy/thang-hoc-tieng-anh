00:00.050 --> 00:04.151
But unless the virus is completely eradicated, which is highly unlikely,...

00:04.665 --> 00:08.640
...there will be risks of it escalating to pandemic levels once again,...

00:09.342 --> 00:12.883
...and factors like animals carrying and transmitting the virus...

00:13.221 --> 00:16.113
...might undermine our best efforts altogether.

00:16.986 --> 00:21.846
So, which strategy is best for this deadly, infectious respiratory virus?

00:22.401 --> 00:24.206
Racing through it is a quick fix,...

00:24.338 --> 00:26.349
...but would be a global catastrophe,...

00:26.621 --> 00:29.791
...and may not work at all if people can be reinfected.

00:30.271 --> 00:35.175
Crushing the virus through coordination alone is also enticing for its speed,...

00:35.571 --> 00:40.103
...but only reliable with true and nearly impossible global cooperation.

00:40.882 --> 00:45.940
That's why vaccination, assisted by as much global coordination as possible,...

00:46.415 --> 00:48.656
...is generally considered to be the winner.

00:49.055 --> 00:52.689
It's the slow, steady, and proven option in the race.

00:53.498 --> 00:57.659
Even if the pandemic officially ends before a vaccine is ready,...

00:57.929 --> 01:00.356
...the virus may reappear seasonally,...

01:00.776 --> 01:03.357
...so vaccines will continue to protect people.

01:03.864 --> 01:06.105
And although it may take years to create,...

01:06.478 --> 01:11.319
...disruptions to most people's lives won't necessarily last the full duration.

01:11.933 --> 01:14.359
Breakthroughs in treatment and prevention of symptoms...

01:14.503 --> 01:16.837
...can make viruses much less dangerous,...

01:17.278 --> 01:20.197
...and therefore require less extreme containment measures.

01:21.123 --> 01:23.705
Take heart: the pandemic will end.

01:24.276 --> 01:27.136
Its legacy will be long-lasting, but not all bad;...

01:27.829 --> 01:31.122
...the breakthroughs, social services, and systems we develop...

01:31.414 --> 01:33.643
...can be used to the betterment of everyone.

01:34.358 --> 01:38.333
And if we take inspiration from the successes and lessons from the failures,...

01:39.004 --> 01:42.112
...we can keep the next potential pandemic so contained...

01:42.600 --> 01:45.955
...that our children's children won't even know its name.
