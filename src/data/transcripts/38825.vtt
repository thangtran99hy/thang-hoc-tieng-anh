WEBVTT

00:04.491 --> 00:07.531
We don't share a nation or a language.

00:08.439 --> 00:11.097
Each of us has a different story,...

00:11.823 --> 00:14.459
...but there is something we all have in common.

00:16.989 --> 00:18.932
We chose to keep our dreams alive.

00:23.492 --> 00:24.886
We carried them with us,...

00:25.552 --> 00:28.072
...across oceans and deserts and cities.

00:31.709 --> 00:33.091
We brought them together...

00:34.577 --> 00:36.982
...to form a team greater than ourselves,...

00:39.674 --> 00:42.055
...one that defies borders and limits.

00:43.487 --> 00:45.859
A team that belongs to everyone...

00:47.535 --> 00:49.949
...because the starting line doesn't care who we are,...

00:50.982 --> 00:52.608
...only that we'll face it...

00:53.302 --> 00:53.869
...together.
