00:09.557 --> 00:12.571
...that I don't fit the box of what an Olympian should be,...

00:14.545 --> 00:18.458
...but I'm proof that the definition is bigger than people think.

00:21.347 --> 00:24.951
I want to inspire the girls out there watching right now,...

00:26.205 --> 00:29.018
...the ones that some people think are too different,...

00:30.150 --> 00:31.106
...too quiet,...

00:32.635 --> 00:33.593
...too something,...

00:36.218 --> 00:42.329
...and if we don't fit that expectation of what people think we're supposed to be, good.

00:49.737 --> 00:52.845
