00:01.997 --> 00:07.087
They say running is a lonely sport,...

00:08.277 --> 00:12.623
...that when you run, you run alone.

00:16.055 --> 00:19.442
But when I run, I run for Trelawny.

00:21.640 --> 00:22.841
I run for Jamaica.

00:26.949 --> 00:28.942
Their beliefs run with me.

00:30.141 --> 00:32.846
Their spirit and their hopes run with me,...

00:33.797 --> 00:38.422
...and the more that joined, the faster we became.

00:39.618 --> 00:41.250
When you're the fastest man alive,...

00:42.170 --> 00:44.273
...people think you will leave the world behind,...

00:44.787 --> 00:49.562
...but when you run together, the world moves with you.
