00:07.037 --> 00:08.457
It all starts with a push.

00:11.955 --> 00:16.394
A push that starts from nothing yet leads to everything.

00:17.834 --> 00:18.620
Was that okay?

00:20.512 --> 00:24.797
A push that goes from riding hills to backyard pools to straight up walls.

00:25.999 --> 00:29.074
Pushing through skinned knees and broken bones.

00:35.311 --> 00:38.883
Over cracked pavement, busted ramps and that single pebble.

00:40.591 --> 00:44.876
It's a push that turns a 360, into a 720 into a 900.

00:46.549 --> 00:48.841
We used to see ourselves as a family of misfits.

00:49.697 --> 00:52.862
But now, the world will call us Olympians.
