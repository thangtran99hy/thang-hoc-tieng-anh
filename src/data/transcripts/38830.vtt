The Art Institute of Chicago is now launching an interactive experience...

00:10.760 --> 00:12.441
...with the help of Airbnb.

00:12.531 --> 00:15.059
You can live like Vincent Van Gogh, but you get to keep your ears.

00:15.409 --> 00:18.461
But if scenes simply isn't enough, you can also spend the night.

00:19.291 --> 00:20.852
It's like jumping into a painting.

00:20.929 --> 00:21.482
It is, look!

00:27.031 --> 00:34.665
Van Gogh's 1888 bedroom painting was recreated and made available to everyone on Airbnb,...

00:36.471 --> 00:40.392
...the perfect platform to immerse yourself into the life of your host.

00:43.672 --> 00:45.396
It's already sold out for this month,...

00:45.685 --> 00:46.852
...but there's always next month.

00:47.139 --> 00:49.113
Good luck scoring a night in that room.

00:49.471 --> 00:52.390
The first block of nights sold out in five minutes,...

00:52.755 --> 00:54.677
...and the guests who got in were thrilled.

00:56.420 --> 00:59.873
Within one week, the story was covered in over 100 countries.

01:01.345 --> 01:03.837
The room not only let people inside Van Gogh's art,...

01:04.469 --> 01:07.453
...it also told the world that Van Gogh's bedrooms...

01:07.757 --> 01:10.045
...had come to the Art Institute of Chicago...

01:12.406 --> 01:16.311
...as thousands of people let themselves into Van Gogh's bedroom.
