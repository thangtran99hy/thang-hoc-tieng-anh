00:00.549 --> 00:03.435
So, to sum up, I think we are all aware...

00:03.546 --> 00:05.959
...that some urgent work does need to be done.

00:06.274 --> 00:10.589
...and we will need to work on a longer term plan for a major refit.

00:11.542 --> 00:15.335
Well, if there's no more discussion, we'll put it to a vote.

00:16.097 --> 00:20.127
We are recommending that tenders be called for the urgent work needed.

00:20.574 --> 00:21.660
All those in favor?

00:23.020 --> 00:24.268
All those against?

00:25.348 --> 00:26.325
Then that's agreed.

00:26.885 --> 00:28.091
Any other business?

00:28.791 --> 00:30.031
Then we'll close the meeting.

00:30.577 --> 00:31.518
Thank you everyone.

00:31.822 --> 00:35.219
The next meeting will be in two weeks at the same time.
