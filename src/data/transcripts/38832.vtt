Customers are getting confused.

00:01.733 --> 00:04.701
It may be cultural or just different personalities.

00:04.993 --> 00:08.441
But, I need to make sure everybody speaks up when they have something to offer.

00:09.599 --> 00:11.035
Some speak quite easily...

00:11.228 --> 00:14.933
...but others need encouragement and they really appreciate being heard.

00:16.181 --> 00:19.011
Sometimes, I try to pull someone in with a compliment...

00:19.242 --> 00:21.726
...or a comment on their experience with the issue.

00:21.965 --> 00:23.803
Or maybe I just beg for their help.

00:24.234 --> 00:27.023
Kida, the purchasing department seems to have figured out a way...

00:27.108 --> 00:28.551
...to use the new part numbers.

00:28.921 --> 00:30.327
Can you explain your workaround?

00:30.776 --> 00:35.617
Sure. So, we saw that the website upgrade appended an extra field to each SKU.

00:36.522 --> 00:39.449
We tried running a conversion which seemed to work fine.

00:39.982 --> 00:42.257
But, we see it only as a temporary solution.

00:42.703 --> 00:46.479
So, it sounds like the best solution is to add the 01 to the end.

00:46.569 --> 00:50.438
Then, when I'm sure everyone has had their say, it's time to end the meeting.

00:50.544 --> 00:52.435
Listen guys, the time is almost up.

00:52.921 --> 00:55.419
Let me review what we've come up with for today.

00:55.547 --> 00:59.862
I always try to end with a positive statement of what we accomplished or agreed on.

01:00.459 --> 01:05.540
While concluding, I'll summarize, assign action steps or schedule the next meeting.

01:05.775 --> 01:08.321
Thanks, everybody. I'll see you all again on Friday...

01:08.409 --> 01:11.222
...when we've had the chance to implement and test these fixes.

01:11.711 --> 01:12.681
See you then.

01:13.171 --> 01:14.147
Goodbye, everyone!
