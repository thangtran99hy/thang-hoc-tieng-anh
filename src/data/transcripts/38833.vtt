Hi, Ryoko! We're just getting started.

00:02.321 --> 00:03.532
I have you on speakerphone.

00:04.685 --> 00:06.766
Oh, hello everybody.

00:06.917 --> 00:07.476
Hey, Ryoko.

00:07.722 --> 00:08.432
Hi, Ryoko.

00:08.568 --> 00:09.395
Hi, Ryoko.

00:09.589 --> 00:11.265
Okay, who wants to start?

00:15.929 --> 00:19.330
I don't like talking in public...

00:20.719 --> 00:22.212
...or at all really.

00:22.603 --> 00:23.931
Harold, please. The floor is yours.

00:25.432 --> 00:29.965
Yesterday, I finished the source code for the recipe request voice interface,...

00:30.153 --> 00:32.503
...and I ran the unit test, so that's done.

00:33.235 --> 00:34.724
But these stand-ups are okay.

00:36.134 --> 00:38.148
You only have to answer three questions.

00:38.388 --> 00:40.105
What did you do yesterday?

00:40.261 --> 00:41.921
What are you doing today?

00:42.344 --> 00:43.865
And what is your main impediment?

00:44.189 --> 00:50.021
Today, I am working on passing the request parameters to the recipe search code.

00:51.045 --> 00:53.781
It's structured. It's fast.

00:58.441 --> 00:59.160
It's painless.

00:59.781 --> 01:05.720
My main impediment is still my lack of knowledge of the speech recognition engine.

01:06.209 --> 01:10.277
Ryoko is our expert and she's been a wonderful help.

01:10.584 --> 01:13.730
But with the time difference, it's just challenging.

01:13.963 --> 01:17.179
Okay. That's very good Harold, but we need to resolve that.

01:17.501 --> 01:17.985
Ryoko?

01:18.129 --> 01:18.365
Hi.

01:18.763 --> 01:19.800
Can you send me your schedule?

01:20.133 --> 01:22.049
I will look into getting travel approval.

01:22.483 --> 01:23.925
Okay, I'll do that.

01:24.424 --> 01:25.129
Thanks, Ryoko.

01:26.170 --> 01:27.126
Why don't you go next?

01:27.609 --> 01:28.451
Okay sure.
