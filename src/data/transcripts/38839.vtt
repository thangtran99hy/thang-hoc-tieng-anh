00:01.287 --> 00:05.262
Now, we're looking at the options for handling our online orders.

00:05.732 --> 00:10.543
They're going through the roof. And frankly, the lead time for delivery is blowing out.

00:11.358 --> 00:13.971
We need to improve our performance in this area.

00:14.967 --> 00:16.087
Any suggestions?

00:16.560 --> 00:18.615
Well, as I see it, we have three options.

00:19.425 --> 00:21.852
The obvious one is to employ more people to do the job.

00:22.762 --> 00:25.561
Another alternative is to automate the system more...

00:25.896 --> 00:27.276
...cut down on the physical handling.

00:28.104 --> 00:29.041
And the third option?

00:30.229 --> 00:31.479
We could outsource.

00:32.087 --> 00:33.709
What are the pros and cons?

00:34.121 --> 00:38.777
Well, looking at increasing staff versus automation, we have to consider the cost.

00:39.785 --> 00:43.141
Automating has a higher capital cost than putting on more staff.

00:43.805 --> 00:47.904
On the other hand, employing more people is more expensive over a long term.

00:48.765 --> 00:51.285
If we keep growing, it'll cost more in the long run.

00:52.062 --> 00:55.417
How likely is it that we'll see continued growth?

00:55.931 --> 00:57.212
I'd say it's a certainty.

00:58.077 --> 00:59.969
I'd say a high probability.

01:00.081 --> 01:01.239
Nothing's certain in business.

01:01.761 --> 01:03.419
So, what about the third option?

01:03.995 --> 01:04.676
Outsourcing?

01:05.569 --> 01:07.407
It does take the problem off our hands.

01:07.824 --> 01:09.464
But, we lose contact with our customers.

01:09.869 --> 01:11.185
What about the bottom line?

01:11.787 --> 01:15.916
Outsourcing is the cheapest option, and the easiest in the short term.

01:16.531 --> 01:18.998
But, if we want to keep the operation in-house,...

01:19.135 --> 01:21.624
...the best option is automating our system.

01:22.823 --> 01:26.676
The only downside is, we're taking a risk that our business will keep growing.

01:27.217 --> 01:28.499
Which we hope it will.

01:28.749 --> 01:30.165
We certainly do.
