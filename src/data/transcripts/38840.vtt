00:00.190 --> 00:02.203
Baseball is witnessing something insane.

00:02.682 --> 00:04.219
One of the best hitters in the league...

00:04.396 --> 00:07.283
...and one of the best pitchers in the league were the same person.

00:07.671 --> 00:09.745
But that's exactly what's going on.

00:10.217 --> 00:13.348
Shohei Ohtani, the first two-way star in a hundred years,...

00:13.633 --> 00:19.242
...goes against everything we thought we knew about baseball, and yet, he is making it look easy.

00:19.780 --> 00:22.115
But what Ohtani is doing is just another level.

00:22.209 --> 00:23.795
He's the best baseball player I've seen in my life.

00:23.942 --> 00:26.973
He can hit the ball 900 feet and throw 99 off the mound.

00:27.078 --> 00:27.431
Yeah!

00:27.539 --> 00:28.956
Like who else is doing that, bro?

00:29.175 --> 00:31.465
So why has Ohtani's story unfolded differently?

00:31.980 --> 00:34.345
Well, it was mostly by chance.

00:35.179 --> 00:39.055
Like many American highschool prospects, Ohtani was a two-way star in Japan.

00:40.133 --> 00:45.129
He led his team deep into the Koshen, a national high school tournament that is a huge deal there.

00:45.870 --> 00:49.316
He was one of the highest profile prospects in Japanese baseball history...

00:49.515 --> 00:52.108
...and everyone everywhere was interested in signing him.

00:52.523 --> 00:56.555
Japanese teams in the Nippon Professional Baseball league, viewed Ohtani as a pitcher.

00:57.357 --> 00:59.301
American teams viewed him as a hitter.

00:59.889 --> 01:04.605
If he signed with a major league team, he almost certainly would have been asked to focus on just his hitting.

01:05.754 --> 01:09.221
The 18-year-old phenom, like dozens of two-way players before him,...

01:09.366 --> 01:11.374
...was ready to focus on just one skill set.

01:11.781 --> 01:16.635
He declared his intent to play in MLB and asked the Japanese teams not to draft him.

01:17.239 --> 01:19.858
But the Nippon Ham Fighters had an ace up their sleeve.

01:20.150 --> 01:22.489
The club took a risk and it paid off.

01:23.337 --> 01:27.161
He spent five seasons with the NPB, proving himself as a two-way threat.

01:27.841 --> 01:30.883
He racked up a league championship and a whole host of hardware.

01:31.005 --> 01:34.434
But just like the Nippon Ham Fighters, the Angels were willing to take the risk.

01:34.879 --> 01:39.405
Take one part phenom talent, add an open-minded GM, a healthy dose of patience,...

01:39.514 --> 01:41.887
...and, voila, we all get to witness history.

01:43.015 --> 01:44.135
But what happens next?

01:44.878 --> 01:47.159
It's like Ohtani unlocked a cheat code.

01:48.104 --> 01:52.065
Teams get two-way star players for the price and roster spot of one.
