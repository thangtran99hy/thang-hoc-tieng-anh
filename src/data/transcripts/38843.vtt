Your whole life, you've done things I could've never imagined doing.

00:10.639 --> 00:12.926
Things almost no one in the world can do.

00:15.035 --> 00:17.457
But I'm proud of you for something else.

00:23.008 --> 00:26.085
I'm proud of you for doing the things that we could all be doing.

00:28.074 --> 00:32.696
The things you do not for yourself but for others.

00:34.407 --> 00:36.225
The things you do every day.

00:37.703 --> 00:39.105
Things that matter.

00:41.719 --> 00:44.567
The impact you have on the world around you.

00:48.382 --> 00:51.540
And I can't wait to see what you do next.
