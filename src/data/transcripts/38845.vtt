How to not cry while cutting onions?

00:03.315 --> 00:04.875
Watch a comedy movie.

00:05.851 --> 00:06.562
No.

00:07.133 --> 00:08.041
When we cut onions,...

00:08.159 --> 00:13.744
...chemicals like sulfoxides and enzymes are released which react to eventually form a gas.

00:14.206 --> 00:19.110
This gas reacts with the lubricating liquid in our eyes and produces sulfuric acid,...

00:19.277 --> 00:20.612
...which makes us cry.

00:22.199 --> 00:27.411
However, if we freeze onions before cutting, then the temperature of onions drops.

00:27.871 --> 00:32.681
Due to this, the sulfoxides and enzymes react slowly producing less gas.

00:32.779 --> 00:35.577
And thus, reducing the amount of crying.

00:35.814 --> 00:39.917
We can even wear tight goggles so that the gas doesn't reach our eyes.

00:41.839 --> 00:44.396
It is also said that below the onion roots,...

00:44.485 --> 00:47.222
...there is a bulb where the concentration of chemicals is more.

00:47.557 --> 00:52.057
Hence, to avoid crying, we should first cut and throw that part.

00:52.690 --> 00:56.541
Also, cutting an onion under running water washes away the chemicals.

00:56.859 --> 01:01.359
Hence, we can also use this method to reduce crying while cutting onions.
