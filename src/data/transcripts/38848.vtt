Hi, I am a period.

00:06.247 --> 00:09.386
I am used at the end of a complete thought.

00:19.182 --> 00:21.397
I am a question mark, right?

00:21.877 --> 00:25.016
Does anyone have any questions?

00:33.859 --> 00:35.595
I am an exclamation mark!

00:35.869 --> 00:37.813
I am used for strong feelings!

00:38.069 --> 00:39.183
I am excited!

00:49.465 --> 00:51.025
I am a comma.

00:51.272 --> 00:55.947
I am used to make a pause between thoughts, and also to list things.

00:56.129 --> 01:01.404
I like cookies, cupcakes, and cucumbers.

01:10.248 --> 01:13.793
Yikes! What is that?

01:15.092 --> 01:17.395
I have no idea.

01:19.432 --> 01:24.645
I like cookies, cupcakes, and cucumbers.
