Why do we get pimples?

00:10.372 --> 00:12.552
Because they don't want me to look handsome.

00:13.479 --> 00:14.494
No.

00:15.021 --> 00:19.069
Pimples are caused due to the activity of the sebaceous gland present inside our skin.

00:20.125 --> 00:23.161
This gland produces an oily substance called sebum.

00:23.588 --> 00:28.295
Sebum comes up to the skin surface through a pore and moisturizes our hair and skin.

00:28.748 --> 00:30.327
Oh, like a moisturizer?

00:31.035 --> 00:32.387
Absolutely.

00:36.363 --> 00:40.205
However, sometimes the pore gets blocked due to dead skin cells.

00:40.609 --> 00:44.421
Due to this blockage, the sebum gets accumulated, creating a bump.

00:44.879 --> 00:48.851
As sebum is a very good source of nutrients for the bacteria in our skin.

00:49.114 --> 00:52.539
They start to grow in that area, leading to an infection.

00:52.986 --> 00:57.306
Our immune system responds to this infection by sending blood and immune cells.

00:57.748 --> 01:01.321
Blood makes the area red whereas the immune cells kill the bacteria...

01:01.513 --> 01:04.495
...resulting in inflammation and formation of a pimple.
