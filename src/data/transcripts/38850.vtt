Why can't birds fly in space?

00:03.675 --> 00:07.804
They want to, but I keep on bringing them back.

00:08.535 --> 00:10.362
What? Oh AumSum.

00:11.778 --> 00:15.629
How birds fly can be best explained using Bernoulli's principle.

00:15.883 --> 00:18.433
Wings of the birds play a major role in this.

00:18.867 --> 00:22.640
The shape of their wings causes air to move much faster above their wings....

00:22.749 --> 00:25.207
...as compared to the air moving below their wings.

00:26.616 --> 00:30.281
This difference in air pressure pushes up on their wings, creating a lift.

00:30.672 --> 00:32.232
Thus allowing a bird to fly.

00:33.423 --> 00:38.977
Also, definition of "to fly" is to move in or pass through air with wings.

00:39.468 --> 00:42.303
Now, space is a vacuum, it has no air.

00:42.544 --> 00:45.339
Thus, without air a bird will not be able to fly.

00:46.977 --> 00:52.004
Finally, even if birds were able to fly in space they will not be able to swallow food.

00:52.753 --> 00:53.693
Why?

00:54.905 --> 00:58.570
Because birds depend on gravity to push their food downwards.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.286
Why do birds crash in to windows?

01:04.413 --> 01:08.449
Because they don't ring bells and walk through doors.

01:09.151 --> 01:10.401
Oh AumSum.

01:11.515 --> 01:15.099
It is estimated that close to a billion birds crash in to windows...

01:15.199 --> 01:17.006
...and die in the US each year.

01:18.445 --> 01:21.295
Firstly, researchers believe that just like humans,...

01:21.389 --> 01:24.094
...even birds are not able to see transparent glass.

01:24.405 --> 01:27.431
Humans can anticipate the presence of transparent glass...

01:27.531 --> 01:30.607
...based on some visual clues like frames or knobs.

01:32.096 --> 01:34.369
But birds lack the ability to do so.

01:35.123 --> 01:39.501
Secondly, it is believed that collisions occur more frequently during breeding season.

01:39.657 --> 01:42.827
As birds, after seeing their own reflection in the window...

01:42.929 --> 01:45.356
...misjudge it for a different bird and attack it.

01:45.765 --> 01:50.229
Lastly, it is also believed that birds perceive the reflected images in the glass...

01:50.331 --> 01:51.539
...to be real objects.

01:51.911 --> 01:53.877
Hence, collisions occur more often...

01:53.980 --> 01:56.604
...when glass is reflecting the images of food or shelter.
