Nowadays, when you see a contest,...

00:03.447 --> 00:06.985
...it's gonna usually be a street contest or a park contest.

00:07.282 --> 00:13.320
A park contest is a mixture of transition and like flowy, more flowy style...

00:13.401 --> 00:18.506
...and street style is gonna be handrails, stairs, ledges.

00:18.717 --> 00:22.199
In park, you're going to really want to look out for speed and patterns.

00:22.330 --> 00:23.088
People are going to be going.

00:23.385 --> 00:25.988
They're going to be doing really long grinds, they're going to be going really high,...

00:26.079 --> 00:28.131
And they're going to be going what kind of pattern they choose...

00:28.225 --> 00:29.761
...it's the way the judge is going to score.

00:29.849 --> 00:32.239
And for street, what you're really going to want to look out for...

00:32.305 --> 00:34.178
...and this can be pretty obvious, is the big section.

00:34.481 --> 00:37.273
The big section is the part of the park right in the middle...

00:37.653 --> 00:40.757
...which has the biggest handrails and you know, it's the highest risk.

00:41.073 --> 00:42.737
And everyone looks different on a skateboard.

00:42.811 --> 00:46.631
Everyone has a different style and just even going to the Olympics...

00:46.713 --> 00:49.593
...and how just creative it is and how everyone looks different on a skateboard,...

00:49.679 --> 00:53.509
...I think that's really cool and it's more of an art form than a competitive sport.
