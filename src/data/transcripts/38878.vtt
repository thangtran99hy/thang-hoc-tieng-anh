00:03.605 --> 00:07.259
Olympic skateboarding features two disciplines: park and street.

00:08.031 --> 00:12.313
Skaters will have three 45-second runs on a hollowed-out park course...

00:12.401 --> 00:15.385
...featuring a complex series of twists and turns.

00:16.158 --> 00:19.250
Skaters gain points by performing spins and tricks midair...

00:19.455 --> 00:22.009
...and then gracefully bring themselves back down to the bowl...

00:22.091 --> 00:24.268
...to do it all over again on the other side.

00:25.062 --> 00:28.329
The street competition features a straight course with stairs,...

00:28.493 --> 00:32.235
...handrails, benches, walls and slopes to mimic a real street.

00:32.699 --> 00:36.555
This kind of skateboarding is characterized by riding along curves and rails...

00:36.813 --> 00:38.671
...leading into the air without using hands...

00:38.881 --> 00:41.505
...and that familiar grind of board on metal.

00:42.426 --> 00:46.538
Skaters will have two 45-second runs to show off their skills.

00:46.963 --> 00:52.155
Judges will score athletes based on speed, difficulty, originality, stability,...

00:52.357 --> 00:54.653
...and the overall flow of the performance.
