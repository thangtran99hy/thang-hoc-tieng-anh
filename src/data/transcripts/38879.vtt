Hey! Thanks for joining me, everyone.

00:02.037 --> 00:06.253
Today, I'd like to start outlining the best way to merge our two engineering teams.

00:06.500 --> 00:07.837
You know, we both follow Agile.

00:07.912 --> 00:11.678
We use Jira but everybody uses Agile just a little differently.

00:12.185 --> 00:15.275
Now, Karen, I've taken a look at your active sprint and it seems super organized.

00:15.375 --> 00:16.209
It's really impressive.

00:17.139 --> 00:20.060
Would you mind taking a moment to tell us about your sprint planning...

00:20.156 --> 00:22.347
...and a little bit more about your Agile process.

00:22.963 --> 00:23.872
Oh, sure.

00:24.035 --> 00:24.819
Of course.

00:27.115 --> 00:32.502
Let me start with my philosophy on Agile.

00:32.836 --> 00:36.927
I really try to be customer-focused and make sure every sprint...

00:37.043 --> 00:40.316
...is packed with stories based on real user feedback.

00:40.444 --> 00:41.344
Our starting point...
