Good morning.

00:01.379 --> 00:02.335
Oh, hello, good morning.

00:02.445 --> 00:03.357
Can I help you?

00:03.700 --> 00:05.233
Yes, you can.

00:05.754 --> 00:10.588
Actually, I'm looking for a present for my brother.

00:11.102 --> 00:12.878
What about a T-shirt?

00:13.325 --> 00:15.368
No, not a T-shirt, no.

00:19.411 --> 00:22.395
How about a denim jacket?

00:23.047 --> 00:26.017
Oh yes, actually that's lovely.

00:26.099 --> 00:26.891
I like that.

00:27.031 --> 00:28.435
What size does he take?

00:29.087 --> 00:31.203
He takes a small.

00:31.591 --> 00:31.960
Okay.

00:37.052 --> 00:37.787
How about this?

00:38.020 --> 00:38.641
Great!

00:38.788 --> 00:39.568
That's lovely.

00:39.695 --> 00:40.887
I'll take that one.

00:41.456 --> 00:42.798
It's 50 euros.

00:44.013 --> 00:45.413
Is there a discount?

00:45.525 --> 00:48.449
There is today, and it's 40 euros with the discount.

00:49.005 --> 00:49.939
Fantastic!

00:50.338 --> 00:51.189
I'll take it.

00:51.342 --> 00:53.354
So, with the discount, that's 40 euros.

00:53.537 --> 00:55.865
40 euros. One moment.

01:04.848 --> 01:05.756
Here's 50.

01:05.907 --> 01:06.567
Thank you.

01:10.985 --> 01:12.298
Here's your ten change.

01:12.379 --> 01:13.396
Thank you very much.

01:13.540 --> 01:15.231
You're welcome, and here's your jacket.
