Shoppers at this Nordstrom department store in Minneapolis...

00:03.938 --> 00:06.429
...have some new choices with the addition of headscarves...

00:06.557 --> 00:10.462
...from the local Somali-American design firm Henna & Hijabs.

00:11.108 --> 00:16.371
CEO Hilal Ibrahim says Muslim women are underrepresented in US retail.

00:16.992 --> 00:18.897
So, this partnership is really special.

00:18.977 --> 00:23.018
We work together to create pieces in this collection...

00:23.127 --> 00:26.765
...that will be sold in stores across the country and in Canada...

00:27.281 --> 00:31.837
...and my hope is that young Muslim women and girls will be able to walk into Nordstrom stores...

00:31.951 --> 00:35.235
...and now purchase their full outfit including their hijab as well.

00:35.677 --> 00:39.131
Ibrahim started selling hijabs at a local hospital gift shop...

00:39.470 --> 00:42.788
...when she saw some patients had to cover their heads with blankets.

00:43.835 --> 00:48.090
Partnering with her firm on this line of silk, cotton and chiffon hijabs...

00:48.446 --> 00:50.795
...is just the opportunity Nordstrom was looking for...

00:51.034 --> 00:54.630
...says the company's Senior Director of Diversity, Mohammed Omar.

00:55.067 --> 00:58.004
The work here with Henna & Hijab and Hilal Ibrahim...

00:58.078 --> 01:01.191
...really exemplifies the work that we've been going after for some time...

01:01.485 --> 01:04.921
...and helping to bring product lines to different segments of the market...

01:05.212 --> 01:06.577
...that have been untouched before.

01:07.183 --> 01:10.371
Ibrahim say partnering with Nordstrom helps make hijab...

01:10.547 --> 01:12.821
...a more visible part of American culture.

01:13.709 --> 01:18.869
As a Somali Muslim American woman, it showcases that it's okay.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.041
Hijabs are normal.

01:20.173 --> 01:23.168
It's a part of American culture, and I want to normalize that.

01:23.255 --> 01:25.759
I want people to come into stores and see hijabs and say,...

01:26.247 --> 01:28.241
..."That is just as American as wearing a t-shirt."

01:28.572 --> 01:32.289
Nordstrom says Ibrahim's hijab collection is available online...

01:32.562 --> 01:35.224
...and in 16 stores across North America.
