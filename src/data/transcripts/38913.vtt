I thought it was just PowerPoint presentations from college or from my high school time.

00:08.841 --> 00:11.228
They were really professional PowerPoint presentations...

00:11.293 --> 00:13.968
...used by McKinsey's consultants, with their clients.

00:15.089 --> 00:19.254
You have this information and you have to be able to think,

00:19.455 --> 00:23.513
"How do I put this in a way that it's visually appealing for the people?"

00:23.634 --> 00:27.083
"How do I make sure that the message is being understood right?"

00:28.247 --> 00:31.185
We work with a lot of information, the entire day...

00:31.292 --> 00:33.474
...and we need to keep our standards really high.

00:33.614 --> 00:36.641
So, we need to pay attention to the details all the time.

00:37.497 --> 00:39.557
We have teams in Poland, in India and in Costa Rica.

00:40.011 --> 00:42.679
Our team is no longer in the same table.

00:42.777 --> 00:44.299
We are across continents.

00:46.621 --> 00:49.421
We do receive information from consultants that, for example,...

00:49.505 --> 00:52.969
..."Oh, this presentation will be shown for an audience of 400 people."

00:53.405 --> 00:56.451
We realize how impactful our job can be.

00:58.369 --> 01:02.487
I think that being able to contribute to someone else in their daily basis...

01:02.564 --> 01:05.379
...and maybe take off a little bit of that load that they already have,...

01:05.483 --> 01:10.603
...it's pretty much like the reason that we continue to do this and continue to improve.
