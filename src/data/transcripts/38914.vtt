00:04.057 --> 00:05.498
Hello hello, welcome.

00:05.587 --> 00:08.881
Welcome to the Enterprise You virtual event.

00:09.337 --> 00:12.011
I am super excited to have you here.

00:12.321 --> 00:17.163
Excited about all the amazing conversations that we're going to have today.

00:17.306 --> 00:20.414
Now, before we begin, let me remind you of one thing.

00:21.136 --> 00:23.223
We won't be recording today's session.

00:23.898 --> 00:25.985
This is a safe space.

00:26.514 --> 00:30.086
Here, there is no judgement, no repercussions,...

00:30.526 --> 00:32.891
...only unconditional love.

00:33.277 --> 00:37.566
Joining us today is a superwoman and an amazing visionary.

00:38.004 --> 00:41.824
And when I say amazing, I mean it.

00:42.272 --> 00:47.702
What's special about her is that she loves helping young adults just like you...

00:48.073 --> 00:50.981
...to build your public speaking confidence.

00:51.103 --> 00:56.069
She believes that the distance between you and everything you want...

00:56.179 --> 00:59.317
...is only one communication away.

00:59.471 --> 01:05.645
As you listen to her story, you'll notice the power in your own voice.

01:05.883 --> 01:09.322
Today, she'll be sharing her top storytelling and pitching tips...

01:09.419 --> 01:13.725
...to help you with your next business presentation or job interview.

01:13.995 --> 01:16.564
Let's welcome Molly Harington.

01:16.939 --> 01:19.473
Molly, it's so good to have you here.

01:19.648 --> 01:21.084
Thank you so much for joining us!
