00:02.162 --> 00:07.500
No injury, thankfully, and that's why I took a step back...

00:07.603 --> 00:10.081
...because I didn't want to do something silly out there and get injured.

00:10.213 --> 00:12.266
So, I thought it was best if these girls took over...

00:12.336 --> 00:14.525
...and did the rest of the job, which they absolutely did.

00:14.636 --> 00:17.611
They're Olympic silver medalists now, and they should be really proud of themselves...

00:17.747 --> 00:20.848
...for how well they did last minute, having to go in.

00:22.138 --> 00:24.177
It's been really stressful, this Olympic Games.

00:24.255 --> 00:27.632
I think, just as a whole, not having an audience there.

00:27.725 --> 00:29.581
A lot of different variables going into it.

00:29.671 --> 00:31.151
It's been a long week.

00:31.237 --> 00:32.993
It's been a long Olympic process.

00:33.130 --> 00:34.751
It's been a long year.

00:36.053 --> 00:38.449
So, just a lot of different variables, and I think...

00:38.682 --> 00:41.319
...we're just a little bit too stressed out,...

00:42.267 --> 00:45.587
...but we should be out here having fun, and sometimes, that's not the case.
