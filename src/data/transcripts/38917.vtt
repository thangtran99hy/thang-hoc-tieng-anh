00:02.281 --> 00:03.483
This is Donna.

00:03.572 --> 00:04.093
How's that?

00:06.442 --> 00:08.596
And this is Donna's office.

00:09.027 --> 00:13.776
Hey! I'm Donna Sarkar and right now I'm in Barbados.

00:14.987 --> 00:17.693
Donna works as a software engineer for Microsoft.

00:19.701 --> 00:22.499
Before the pandemic, she rarely worked from home.

00:22.863 --> 00:26.559
When this pandemic set in, I honestly had culture shock.

00:26.853 --> 00:31.943
I've never worked a job where I have zero human interaction in my 20 years of tech.

00:33.076 --> 00:36.865
So, it all started June of 2020.

00:39.621 --> 00:42.299
We've been now in lockdown since March.

00:42.436 --> 00:43.351
We're not going outside,

00:43.439 --> 00:44.515
We're not meeting anyone.

00:44.673 --> 00:51.189
I see this random article that said Barbados is offering a one-year remote work visa...

00:51.282 --> 00:52.656
...to foreigners all over the world.

00:53.356 --> 00:55.162
And I thought, that's kind of interesting.

00:58.055 --> 01:02.695
Three months later, Donna and her husband said farewell to their home in Seattle...

01:03.103 --> 01:05.066
...and up sticks to Barbados.

01:06.521 --> 01:08.461
Last night, we sat out in the boardwalk...

01:08.574 --> 01:11.697
...and had rum punches and tacos and overlooked the ocean,...

01:12.017 --> 01:12.807
...and it was magical.

01:13.452 --> 01:18.063
It was a throwback to a time like almost a year ago when you could do that.

01:21.540 --> 01:25.308
Working from paradise was made possible by a special visa...

01:25.655 --> 01:29.548
...which allowed Donna and her husband to continue doing their jobs in Barbados...

01:29.909 --> 01:32.615
...while still paying income tax in America.

01:33.501 --> 01:34.866
When I dial into meetings, people are like,

01:34.958 --> 01:37.926
"Oh, look at you and your beautiful sunny skies outside."

01:38.009 --> 01:38.673
And I'm like,...

01:38.807 --> 01:40.474
..."Yeah, sorry not sorry at all"...

01:40.675 --> 01:44.031
...given that in Seattle, it's gloom and doom and dark at four o'clock and raining.
