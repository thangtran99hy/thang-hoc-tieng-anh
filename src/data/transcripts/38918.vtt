So, how can employers ensure the physical and mental well-being of their employees...

00:05.403 --> 00:06.716
...when they work from home?

00:11.069 --> 00:15.375
For inspiration, it might be worth looking to the world leader in remote working.

00:16.147 --> 00:20.432
Finland has been at the forefront of flexible working since the 1990s.

00:21.337 --> 00:25.591
Even before the pandemic, almost a third of Finns occasionally work from home,...

00:26.117 --> 00:28.265
...including Kirsimarja Bloomqvist.

00:30.993 --> 00:35.866
And I got a small electronic desk and I have this flat screen before.

00:36.247 --> 00:37.529
And I have a good chair.

00:37.837 --> 00:42.069
And I have a window now out to the yard or garden and forest.

00:42.469 --> 00:45.979
And also, this is my yoga studio as well.

00:46.197 --> 00:47.355
So, it's perfect.

00:50.369 --> 00:54.199
Kirsimarja is a Finnish professor who's been researching remote working.

00:55.611 --> 00:58.223
In Finland, there's a long tradition for remote work.

00:59.961 --> 01:01.127
There are several reasons,...

01:01.209 --> 01:06.326
...but one is that we have a good broadband all across the country.

01:06.452 --> 01:10.327
And then also, I would say that the digitalization at the workplace,...

01:10.406 --> 01:13.398
...so you don't have to take all the papers from work to home,...

01:13.538 --> 01:16.683
...and the high portion of knowledge workers in Finland.

01:16.967 --> 01:21.915
And then another thing, which I also think is quite important, is the culture of trust.

01:22.117 --> 01:24.946
And that is something we also see in our research.

01:26.076 --> 01:29.308
Finland even has a specific remote working law...

01:29.555 --> 01:32.787
...which allows employees to work from somewhere other than their office...

01:32.923 --> 01:34.235
...for at least half the week.

01:34.948 --> 01:37.189
All this meant that when the pandemic hit,...

01:37.495 --> 01:40.344
...the shift to remote working for many Finns was...

01:40.531 --> 01:41.771
...surprisingly easy.
