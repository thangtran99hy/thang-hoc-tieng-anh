Apple on Tuesday reported quarterly sales and profits that beat analyst expectations...

00:06.372 --> 00:09.759
...as consumers bought premium versions of its 5G iPhones...

00:09.958 --> 00:12.725
...and signed up for the company's subscription services.

00:13.211 --> 00:15.545
Driven by better-than-expected iPhone sales,...

00:15.855 --> 00:20.201

00:20.617 --> 00:23.043

00:23.363 --> 00:28.050
...that was well above analyst expectations of 73.3 billion dollars.

00:28.577 --> 00:34.750
Apple launched its iPhone 12 models all with 5G connectivity later than usual last year.

00:34.993 --> 00:38.379
Sales that would normally happen in the company's first fiscal quarter...

00:38.688 --> 00:39.909
...were pushed to the second.

00:40.471 --> 00:44.914
Executives warned investors to expect a steeper drop in iPhone sales than usual...

00:45.015 --> 00:46.049
...in the third quarter.

00:46.890 --> 00:49.719
The other major driver was Apple's services business,...

00:49.959 --> 00:54.368
...which includes paid subscriptions for television and music as well as its App Store.

00:54.919 --> 00:56.758

...where customers are buying up accessories...

01:09.349 --> 01:12.147
...such as the Apple Watch to pair with their iPhones.

01:12.651 --> 01:14.789
The results come as investors who once worried...

01:14.886 --> 01:18.366
...that Apple was too dependent on sales of its signature computing device,...

01:18.605 --> 01:23.571
