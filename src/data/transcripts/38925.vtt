Most countries have a central bank that manages the money supply...

00:10.555 --> 00:13.985
...and is independent from the government to prevent political interference.

00:14.825 --> 00:17.887
The government can implement many types of economic policy,...

00:18.065 --> 00:23.034
...like decreasing people's taxes and creating jobs through public infrastructure projects.

00:23.268 --> 00:26.406
But it actually can't just increase the money supply.

00:26.922 --> 00:31.301
The central bank determines how much money is in circulation at a time.

00:31.859 --> 00:35.843
So, why can't central banks authorize the printing of unlimited money...

00:35.915 --> 00:37.352
...to help an economy in crisis?

00:38.049 --> 00:40.752
They could, but that's a short-term solution...

00:41.086 --> 00:44.551
...that doesn't necessarily boost economic growth in the long term...

00:44.873 --> 00:47.019
...and can actually hurt the economy.

00:47.641 --> 00:48.098
Why?

00:49.023 --> 00:54.495
With more money in circulation, manufacturers of goods like food, clothing, and cars...

00:54.753 --> 00:57.819
...could respond to demand simply by raising prices...

00:58.250 --> 01:00.652
...rather than manufacturing more of these goods...

01:00.925 --> 01:02.798
...and creating new jobs in the process.

01:03.857 --> 01:07.704
This would mean you could no longer buy as much with the same amount of money,...

01:08.014 --> 01:10.466
...a situation known as inflation.

01:10.999 --> 01:13.840
A little bit of inflation, about 2% a year,...

01:14.111 --> 01:18.870
...is considered a sign of economic health but more can quickly derail an economy.
