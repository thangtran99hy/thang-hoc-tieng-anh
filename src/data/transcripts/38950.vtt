00:00.427 --> 00:02.632
I think people would get back.

00:02.751 --> 00:08.071
I think that the step of coming in from the period we were...

00:08.309 --> 00:10.495
...with the fear and anxiety, and so on.

00:11.105 --> 00:13.069
Going back is just a difficult step.

00:13.443 --> 00:17.019
But if we would get people to do it, for even a month or two,...

00:17.609 --> 00:21.791
...I think people would be very, very different on the end of the experience.

00:21.900 --> 00:25.262
And we're talking about something that has taken a tremendous amount of time.

00:26.025 --> 00:30.803
And people don't have really good intuition now about this transition...

00:30.916 --> 00:32.337
...from this period to the next period.

00:32.863 --> 00:33.936
We need to try it out.

00:34.908 --> 00:39.436
And lots of things are standing in the way, it's frightening, it's effortful,...

00:39.849 --> 00:41.966
...we get used to doing what we,...

00:42.172 --> 00:46.517
...look people did not stand there and have empty time...

00:46.603 --> 00:48.131
...people filled the time in different ways.

00:48.239 --> 00:49.434
Now, they have to give up something.

00:50.433 --> 00:52.929
So, it will need adjustment.

00:53.247 --> 00:55.823
The people who did not work will need will need adjustment,...

00:55.920 --> 00:57.021
...but they need to try it out.

00:57.455 --> 01:03.252
One thing that I am predicting is that people don't understand...

01:03.407 --> 01:05.276
...how much they miss other people.

01:06.061 --> 01:10.098
I think we forget the joys that we have from other people.
