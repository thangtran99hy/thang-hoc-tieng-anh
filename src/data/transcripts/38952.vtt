00:00.386 --> 00:03.501
Luxor is a busy port for river cruise boats.

00:03.845 --> 00:06.868
Fleets of these provide multiday Nile cruises,...

00:06.979 --> 00:09.808
...which have become a standard part of an Egyptian tour.

00:10.793 --> 00:15.542
We're riding one farther upstream for a look at the most scenic stretch of the Nile.

00:17.513 --> 00:21.529
As if on a floating resort hotel, tourists enjoy the deck...

00:22.890 --> 00:25.781
...with its pool, the attentive service...

00:26.379 --> 00:30.621
...and the views from their perch atop three floors of staterooms.

00:31.131 --> 00:33.899
The trip upriver takes you by natural beauty...

00:34.104 --> 00:39.379
...and seemingly ancient scenes interrupted only by modern cruise boats.

00:41.191 --> 00:45.086
Long stretches pass by timeless slices of Egyptian life...

00:45.201 --> 00:48.898
...as vacationers have little option but to relax...

00:49.013 --> 00:51.449
...and live at the pace of the steady boat...

00:51.549 --> 00:54.402
...heading against the current of the fabled river.

00:57.257 --> 01:03.647
It's so peaceful, until the tranquility is broken by pirates?

01:05.666 --> 01:09.269
Nope! They're eager and enterprising salesmen...

01:09.443 --> 01:16.098
...who artfully tie up to the surging river boats to display, model and haggle,...

01:18.457 --> 01:20.915
...selling their souvenirs the hard way.
