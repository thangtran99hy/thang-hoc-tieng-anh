So, growing up, I didn't really see many female pilots or females or computer scientists.

00:05.469 --> 00:07.739
Those are two of my passions, and it's quite discouraging...

00:07.826 --> 00:11.257
...when there's no one that you know, can relate to that, does any of those things,...

00:11.368 --> 00:13.614
...so then I wanted to fly around the world,...

00:13.720 --> 00:18.123
...hopefully have other girls see me and think, "I'd love to fly one day too."

00:18.371 --> 00:21.371
When she first told me about it, my heart skipped a beat,...

00:21.784 --> 00:27.513
...and it took me a bit of time to digest, and now I'm so proud...

00:27.597 --> 00:29.207
...and fully, fully behind her.

00:29.609 --> 00:31.938
But as I said, mixed feelings.

00:32.444 --> 00:33.624
Yeah, it's exciting.

00:35.239 --> 00:35.953
It's really exciting.

00:36.617 --> 00:38.386
I see the risk; I understand them.

00:38.963 --> 00:39.743
So does she,...

00:40.665 --> 00:43.448
...but I'm really proud of what she's doing, not just for herself...

00:43.549 --> 00:47.833
...but also this, in a bid to level the playing field for women...

00:47.909 --> 00:50.815
...getting into STEM and aviation, so I think it's fantastic.
