00:00.459 --> 00:04.001
So, bubble wrap actually was never intended to be packaging material.

00:04.642 --> 00:06.928
That's right; it was meant to be wallpaper.

00:07.708 --> 00:08.300
Fun facts!

00:09.734 --> 00:12.935
My name is Bradley Hart, and I'm known for making bubble wrap art.

00:14.305 --> 00:15.704
I first select the perfect image,...

00:15.882 --> 00:20.083
...load it into my computer software that I created, which allows me to zoom in and out,...

00:20.577 --> 00:22.725
...colorizing the various bubbles one by one.

00:23.496 --> 00:27.316
I then inject anywhere from three to 500 bubbles an hour.

00:29.154 --> 00:33.160
My work allows me to explore the topics of plasticity of our world that we live in,...

00:33.431 --> 00:36.353
...and to make the statements I want to.

00:36.861 --> 00:40.836
My pieces range anywhere from 10,000 to 120,000 dollars.

00:41.531 --> 00:45.138
My work plays with that cultural trope on whether or not you're allowed to touch art or not...

00:45.736 --> 00:49.503
...because everybody just feels that need to want to zoom in and touch it.

00:50.534 --> 00:51.780
My bubbles are not poppable.

00:52.636 --> 00:55.125
They're filled with paint, and the paint is dry.
