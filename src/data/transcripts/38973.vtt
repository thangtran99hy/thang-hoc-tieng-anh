Greetings Sharks, I'm Rener Gracie and I'm seeking a $500,000 investment...

00:04.007 --> 00:07.752
...in exchange for a 5% equity stake in my apparel company, Quikflip.

00:08.145 --> 00:12.778
It was a cold December morning and my son wanted to go to the park...

00:12.864 --> 00:15.593
...so, I threw on my favorite hoodie and off we went.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.624
After about 30 minutes of chasing this guy around the park,...

00:18.719 --> 00:22.724
...the sun began peeking through the clouds and I started to sweat.

00:23.095 --> 00:26.466
At that point, I had no choice but to take off my hoodie.

00:26.629 --> 00:28.811
You can probably guess what my options were.

00:29.328 --> 00:31.313
We have the fanny pack.

00:31.847 --> 00:34.003
We have the European yacht club.

00:34.570 --> 00:35.258
I see you, Robert.

00:37.379 --> 00:39.202
And then we have the wannabe cool guy.

00:39.334 --> 00:40.566
This is the option I stuck with.

00:40.826 --> 00:43.771
But when I finally caught up to little man, I bent over to pick him up.

00:44.063 --> 00:48.473
And the hoodie slipped off my shoulder on to the wet grass.

00:48.635 --> 00:49.812
Oh no!

00:50.047 --> 00:51.549
There has to be a better way!

00:51.639 --> 00:53.860
Sharks, that was it, Quikflip was born.

00:54.330 --> 00:54.899
Check this out.

00:55.053 --> 01:00.050
Flip it, tuck it, shake it, and voila!

01:00.247 --> 01:04.753
In a matter seconds, using our proprietary conversion technology,...

01:04.889 --> 01:10.783
...we can take any outer layer garment into a fully functional backpack in a flash.

01:10.990 --> 01:12.858
With our slide and bite technology,...

01:12.961 --> 01:17.400
...you can adjust the pack to keep it safe and secure during literally any activity,...

01:17.592 --> 01:18.870
...even Jiujitsu with your brother.

01:23.105 --> 01:24.421
But wait, there's more.

01:26.793 --> 01:29.066
You can store anything you want inside the backpack.

01:29.303 --> 01:33.073
And when the temperature drops, simply reach in, take out your stuff with one hand.

01:33.165 --> 01:33.885
Sharks, count one to three.

01:34.197 --> 01:39.056
Too late we're already back to full hoodie functionality in a matter of seconds.

01:39.209 --> 01:41.188
All I need are my black belt business partners...

01:43.851 --> 01:45.630
...to help me submit the outer wear industry...

01:45.697 --> 01:47.901
...and flip your investments into black belt profits.

01:48.631 --> 01:49.151
Who's with me?
