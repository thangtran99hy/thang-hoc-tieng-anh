Now say hello.

00:02.067 --> 00:03.088

Let's have a race.

00:10.585 --> 00:14.080
When she was finding her voice, she didn't see limits.

00:14.176 --> 00:17.233
The winner is Beyonce Knowles, female pop vocalist.

00:17.394 --> 00:18.946
She saw possibilities.

00:19.660 --> 00:21.087
To be more than a singer.

00:21.867 --> 00:23.091
More than a dancer.

00:23.731 --> 00:26.243
More than an icon.

00:36.345 --> 00:40.438
She saw that she could be an inspiration to all people.

00:40.564 --> 00:43.539
Beyonce has inspired me to just keep pushing and going.

00:43.635 --> 00:45.339
The possibilities are unlimited.

00:45.491 --> 00:51.014
So that she and they and we could see possibilities, too.
