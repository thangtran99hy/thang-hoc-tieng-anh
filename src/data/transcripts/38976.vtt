00:02.393 --> 00:03.060
You know what?

00:03.849 --> 00:07.947
Here's to going for it and being terrible.

00:08.319 --> 00:12.106
Here's to giving it a shot even though your shot is garbage!

00:12.350 --> 00:13.623
To being the queen of the court.

00:13.740 --> 00:15.465
Well, maybe not this court.

00:16.183 --> 00:19.628
To feeling the burn, even if there shouldn't be a burn to feel.

00:19.858 --> 00:23.648
To trying your best, even though your swing is the worst.

00:23.988 --> 00:27.371
Here's to going down way harder than you get back up.

00:33.152 --> 00:37.195
To giving it your all, even though you kind of suck.

00:40.776 --> 00:42.218
But you know what doesn't suck?

00:46.584 --> 00:49.143
Trying to do something you've never done before.

00:54.531 --> 00:55.659
That doesn't suck at all.

00:58.038 --> 00:58.941
Not even a little.
