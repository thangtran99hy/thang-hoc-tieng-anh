Starbucks is quitting its joint venture in South Korea,...

00:04.355 --> 00:06.473
...the firm's fifth largest market.

00:06.925 --> 00:10.312
It's selling a part of its stake to a local partner Emart.

00:10.645 --> 00:15.177
The rest is being snapped up by Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC.

00:15.791 --> 00:18.101
Retailer Emart will operate the stores...

00:18.202 --> 00:23.761
...and buy an additional 17.5 percent stake for 411 million dollars.

00:24.435 --> 00:28.998
That suggests a 2.35 billion-dollar value for the whole business.

00:29.568 --> 00:33.141
Starbucks said the deal would be completed in 90 days.

00:33.505 --> 00:37.511
Its South Korean office wouldn't comment on why the firm was selling up.

00:38.004 --> 00:41.638
With more than 1,500 stores across 78 cities,...

00:41.981 --> 00:45.117
...Starbucks Coffee Korea saw operating profits surge...

00:45.221 --> 00:48.607
...nearly three quarters over the January to March quarter.
