00:00.525 --> 00:01.491
Watch them hit a few balls.

00:01.637 --> 00:03.135
Alright, so tell me your names again.

00:03.304 --> 00:03.878
I'm Venus.

00:03.973 --> 00:04.561
I'm Serena.

00:08.324 --> 00:09.478
So, what do you think?

00:11.899 --> 00:15.650
I wrote me a 78-page plan for their whole career before they were even born.

00:15.745 --> 00:16.621
Yeah, baby yeah!

00:17.199 --> 00:19.157
If these girls are so great, how come I've never heard of them?

00:19.282 --> 00:20.207
They're from Compton.

00:20.433 --> 00:23.299
It's okay, they're just not used to seeing good-looking people like us.

00:24.439 --> 00:26.733
She's nervous, take a step up.

00:28.627 --> 00:30.295
Maybe she ought to take a few more steps up.

00:30.422 --> 00:31.419
Just get someplace safe.

00:32.078 --> 00:34.311
I think you might just have the next Michael Jordan.

00:34.403 --> 00:36.751
Oh no, brother man, I got me the next two.

00:38.547 --> 00:43.157
This next step you're about to take, you're not going to just be representing you.

00:43.255 --> 00:46.765
You would be representing every little black girl on Earth.

00:47.991 --> 00:49.607
I'm not gonna let you down.

00:49.907 --> 00:50.633
How could you?

00:52.267 --> 00:55.261
This world ain't never had no respect for Richard Williams,...

00:55.524 --> 00:56.613
...but they're going to respect y'all.

00:58.639 --> 01:00.466
You're going to walk out there with your head up.

01:00.735 --> 01:03.753
You are a champion, and the whole world knows.

01:07.807 --> 01:13.515
The most dangerous creature on this whole earth is a woman who knows how to think.

01:13.855 --> 01:14.845
Yes, daddy.

01:15.188 --> 01:16.380
Ain't nothing she can't do.

01:19.553 --> 01:21.062
Are you going to show them how dangerous you are?

01:24.293 --> 01:24.947
Yes.

01:27.491 --> 01:31.473
Venus and Serena are going to shake up this world.
