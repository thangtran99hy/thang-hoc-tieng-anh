00:00.082 --> 00:02.328
It's only my love for your father, rest his soul,...

00:02.533 --> 00:04.589
...that stands between you and a life on the street.

00:05.093 --> 00:06.711
I have to make a life for myself.

00:06.921 --> 00:08.183
I'll sell one of my signature dresses.

00:08.295 --> 00:09.415
Soon, everyone will know my name.

00:14.307 --> 00:18.003
To make sure your nuptials are done properly, we shall hold a ball.

00:18.144 --> 00:19.407
You shall find a bride.

00:23.223 --> 00:24.876
Cinderella, you don't need to go to the ball.

00:25.091 --> 00:27.163
Please, stepmother, I spent weeks making this dress.

00:27.280 --> 00:28.564
My future depends on it.

00:38.002 --> 00:41.968
Yes! I am your fabulous godmother.

00:42.266 --> 00:43.374
Do you want to go to that ball,...

00:43.454 --> 00:45.389
...and meet a bunch of rich people who will change your life?

00:45.492 --> 00:47.873
Yes, I was just crying and singing about it like two minutes ago.

00:48.018 --> 00:50.913
Then go you shall!

00:51.283 --> 00:53.256
Oh. Well, look at that. This is different.

00:53.355 --> 00:56.160
Okay, dang, you said you wanted to be a businesswoman.

00:56.385 --> 00:57.575
It's magic time.

00:59.938 --> 01:00.634
Where's my tail?

01:00.796 --> 01:02.163
I can't balance without my tail!

01:08.594 --> 01:09.729
Oh my god. That didn't happen.

01:09.819 --> 01:10.668
It didn't happen.

01:10.819 --> 01:12.596
Hi, would you like to dance?

01:12.769 --> 01:13.340
Right now?

01:15.475 --> 01:16.652
Where did you get that dress?

01:16.767 --> 01:17.414
I designed it.

01:18.124 --> 01:19.516
I pick you to be my princess.

01:19.642 --> 01:20.397
What about my work?

01:20.715 --> 01:23.159
I don't want a life stuck waving from a royal box...

01:23.490 --> 01:25.274
...any more than a life confined to a basement.

01:25.841 --> 01:28.063
Life outside this basement starts right now.
