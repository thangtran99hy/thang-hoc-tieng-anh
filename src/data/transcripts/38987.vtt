00:04.731 --> 00:05.797
So, what are you doing out here?

00:08.492 --> 00:14.603
There is a legend in the jungles of the Amazon of a tree that heals all.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.047
It could change the world...

00:16.782 --> 00:21.655
...but if it gets into the wrong hands, it could awaken a great evil.

00:23.611 --> 00:25.658
I believe that the legend is real.

00:25.727 --> 00:26.070
Which is not.

00:26.158 --> 00:26.819
And I'm gonna find it.

00:26.903 --> 00:27.351
But you won't.

00:27.439 --> 00:29.965
When I do, just imagine the lives that could be saved.

00:32.081 --> 00:34.237
I've been looking for this tree longer than anybody.

00:35.909 --> 00:39.110
I've tracked a legend to every village, every island, nothing.

00:39.463 --> 00:41.313
You're searching for something that can't be found.

00:44.189 --> 00:45.369
But you've never had the key.

00:47.235 --> 00:48.571
Let's do something that's safe.

00:48.689 --> 00:49.531
Let's go see some elephants.

00:49.623 --> 00:52.359
There are no elephants in the Amazon and I don't even like elephants.

00:52.454 --> 00:53.668
Lady, everybody likes elephants.

00:55.395 --> 00:56.595
Know this about the jungle:...

00:57.777 --> 01:01.054
...everything that you see wants to kill you and can.

01:03.586 --> 01:05.161
Careful. They can smell fear.

01:05.771 --> 01:07.047
I am not afraid.

01:12.462 --> 01:13.509
Oh my gosh.

01:15.342 --> 01:17.261
Who brings a submarine to the Amazon?

01:19.254 --> 01:20.073
Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank.

01:27.636 --> 01:28.279
Goodnight.

01:34.693 --> 01:35.185
I got you.

01:39.745 --> 01:40.275
Frank, get it.

01:40.425 --> 01:40.769
Hold on.

01:40.845 --> 01:41.143
Come on.

01:41.393 --> 01:41.747
I got it.

01:41.835 --> 01:41.983
Frank.

01:42.777 --> 01:43.199
I don't got it.

01:43.291 --> 01:45.937
No, no, no, no, no. For goodness' sake, just leave me alone.

01:46.029 --> 01:47.063
That was a disaster.

01:47.178 --> 01:48.179
It didn't go the way I planned.
