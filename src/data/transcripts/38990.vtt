00:00.773 --> 00:05.024
Lately, more and more variants are emerging in various places around the world.

00:05.970 --> 00:08.211
So, why are they showing up now?

00:09.200 --> 00:11.069
And what does this mean for the pandemic?

00:15.551 --> 00:17.344
Viruses are very simple.

00:17.686 --> 00:21.519
They're basically just a shell of protein surrounding some genetic material:...

00:21.743 --> 00:23.365
...either DNA or RNA.

00:24.253 --> 00:26.573
That genetic material is made up of molecules...

00:26.676 --> 00:29.629
...that can be represented as a series of letters, like this.

00:30.617 --> 00:34.855
Each part of this code contains instructions for how to make one specific protein...

00:34.962 --> 00:36.603
...that allows the virus to function.

00:37.315 --> 00:40.329
A virus has one goal: to make more of itself.

00:40.963 --> 00:44.103
But because it's so simple, it can't do that on its own.

00:44.953 --> 00:46.477
So, it uses you.

00:47.412 --> 00:51.789
Every time a virus infects a person, it uses their cells to make copies of itself...

00:52.346 --> 00:57.002
...replicating this complex code again, and again, and again.

00:57.587 --> 00:59.859
But eventually, it makes a mistake.

01:00.690 --> 01:02.745
Sometimes, it deletes or adds a letter.

01:02.865 --> 01:04.467
Sometimes it flips them around.

01:05.121 --> 01:06.866
That mistake is called a mutation,...

01:06.949 --> 01:09.933
...and it slightly changes the instructions for making the virus.

01:10.385 --> 01:13.211
That slightly altered virus is a variant.
