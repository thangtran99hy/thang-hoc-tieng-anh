00:00.493 --> 00:04.408
It's important to remember that a virus doesn't make active decisions.

00:04.937 --> 00:07.611
It's not as if it creates a strategy within your cells.

00:08.131 --> 00:10.612
Mutations are random errors,...

00:11.739 --> 00:16.665
...but the longer a virus is around, and the more people it infects, the more it will change,...

00:17.104 --> 00:18.735
...and the more those changes accumulate,...

00:18.983 --> 00:22.138
...the more chances the virus has to evolve into something more dangerous.

00:23.419 --> 00:27.539
These four variants, considered "variants of concern" by the World Health Organization,...

00:27.757 --> 00:29.912
...all have mutations on the spike protein.

00:30.810 --> 00:35.246
Delta, the most recent addition to this list, has been referred to as a "double mutant,"...

00:35.494 --> 00:40.405
...because, while it has many different mutations, it has two significant ones we've seen before.

00:41.468 --> 00:44.301
This mutation seems to make the virus more transmissible,...

00:44.827 --> 00:47.667
...and a version of this one, found in two other variants,...

00:47.899 --> 00:52.534
...makes it easier for the virus to reinfect people who have already had COVID-19,...

00:53.234 --> 00:58.011
...meaning these two mutations may have evolved to dodge our natural immune response.

01:00.192 --> 01:02.725
Fortunately, the immune response we get from vaccines...

01:02.807 --> 01:05.942
...is much stronger than our body's natural immune response.

01:06.877 --> 01:11.161
So, while we may see variants that make our vaccines somewhat less effective,...

01:11.787 --> 01:17.462
...most experts think it's unlikely one will emerge that completely evades our vaccines.
