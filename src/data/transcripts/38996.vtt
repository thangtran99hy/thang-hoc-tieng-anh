What is the argument for forcing people to get vaccinated?

00:04.700 --> 00:09.530
I mean, the argument for mandatory vaccination is that you get better coverage...

00:09.817 --> 00:11.741
...and that's good for public health.

00:11.853 --> 00:13.989
It's good for everyone's safety and obviously,...

00:14.263 --> 00:18.737
...protects  people who can't get vaccinated or who aren't protected well by vaccines.

00:19.222 --> 00:21.651
Are COVID vaccines mandatory anywhere?

00:22.944 --> 00:25.876
COVID vaccines, by and large, are not mandatory...

00:25.975 --> 00:28.718
...although it will depend where you are in the world...

00:28.819 --> 00:31.219
...and what job you do as well.

00:31.607 --> 00:34.904
And also, it's changing as we speak.

00:35.015 --> 00:38.996
People are formulating new policies on this all the time.

00:40.126 --> 00:45.589
Italy was the first European country to mandate COVID vaccines for healthcare workers.

00:45.994 --> 00:47.431
And I think as we look forward,...

00:47.511 --> 00:52.259
...we'll see lots of healthcare workers being pressured by governments to get vaccines.

00:52.838 --> 00:53.445
And in the US,...

00:53.515 --> 00:56.970
...we were seeing this really interesting pushback against vaccine mandates...

00:57.078 --> 00:58.727
...before they were even implemented.

00:59.149 --> 01:03.886
Many states had passed laws against mandatory vaccinations,...

01:03.953 --> 01:04.871
...states like Florida.

01:05.019 --> 01:08.995
But, with the latest wave of COVID cases,...

01:09.104 --> 01:14.383
...we're seeing that many state governments, many city governments,...

01:14.468 --> 01:18.200
...as well as private institutions are starting to mandate those vaccines.
