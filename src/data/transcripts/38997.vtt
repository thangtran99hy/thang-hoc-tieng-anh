Can employers make vaccines mandatory?

00:04.711 --> 00:07.937
You know, what's possible will really depend on what country you're in.

00:08.287 --> 00:11.308
Some countries like Canada, it's certainly quite hard.

00:11.766 --> 00:17.587
In Britain, if you are hiring new staff, then, certainly, that does appear to be the case.

00:18.311 --> 00:23.834
I know that employers here do want to do this for existing staff...

00:24.131 --> 00:27.697
...and I think what we will see in Britain and in other countries...

00:27.797 --> 00:32.361
...is that this will get tested legally as employers bring this in.

00:32.597 --> 00:34.058
And in the United States,...

00:34.163 --> 00:37.842
...state governments and private employers can definitely mandate vaccines.

00:38.173 --> 00:42.054
There are three exceptions that tend to come into play.

00:42.316 --> 00:47.428
There's personal beliefs, religion, as well as medical exceptions.

00:47.863 --> 00:51.312
And in some states, like California and New York,...

00:51.662 --> 00:54.653
...they don't even actually allow for a religious exemption...

00:54.755 --> 00:56.125
...or a personal belief exemption.

00:56.470 --> 00:59.640
So, it's actually quite surprising when you dig in.

01:00.380 --> 01:04.107
Do you think governments will ever make COVID vaccines mandatory?

01:04.491 --> 01:07.112
Well, we know that they have in Saudi Arabia.

01:07.237 --> 01:09.090
We know that the Moscow government...

01:09.209 --> 01:14.641
...has rolled out a mandatory vaccination program for service sector workers.

01:14.748 --> 01:18.003
So, I think it's clear that some governments will do this.

01:18.160 --> 01:21.670
It is not constitutional for the federal government...

01:21.745 --> 01:24.487
...to require all US citizens to get a vaccine.

01:24.809 --> 01:26.411
What would be more likely to happen...

01:26.499 --> 01:31.517
...is that state governments require it to varying degrees.
