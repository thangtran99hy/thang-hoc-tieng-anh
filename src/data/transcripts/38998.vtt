The amazing thing about this pandemic compared with all previous pandemics...

00:03.189 --> 00:04.437
...is the amount of data we have.

00:04.985 --> 00:09.144
The results show that the world is never going to be the same again.

00:11.711 --> 00:13.147
The world before the pandemic is gone.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.369
We're not going back to it.

00:14.542 --> 00:18.332
The big question is, to what extent are things going to snap back?

00:18.684 --> 00:20.037
We're not gonna snap back all the way.

00:20.123 --> 00:21.627
It's clear that people aren't going to go on doing...

00:21.702 --> 00:23.740
...all the things they've been doing in the pandemic.

00:23.845 --> 00:25.916
But nor are they gonna go back to the way things were before.

00:26.234 --> 00:27.733
So, the answer is going to be somewhere in the middle.

00:27.872 --> 00:31.465
And exactly where it is in the middle is going to vary by country,...

00:31.597 --> 00:33.992
...by activity, by industry, by household.

00:34.309 --> 00:36.294
And so, that's what makes it so unpredictable.

00:38.303 --> 00:41.637
Possibly one of the biggest long-term changes from the pandemic...

00:41.727 --> 00:43.595
...is going to be more people working from home.

00:44.271 --> 00:47.473
Our index shows that office occupancy is rising...

00:47.929 --> 00:51.089
...but it probably won't ever rise to pre-pandemic levels.

00:52.241 --> 00:55.908
Companies will probably let people work from home or the office.
