If you're the one leading the discussion, of course you want to test the software,...

00:04.389 --> 00:05.880
...your microphone, your video,...

00:06.223 --> 00:10.447
...everything related to the videoconferencing platform before the meeting starts.

00:10.719 --> 00:13.777
In addition to that, you should ask your participants to do the same.

00:13.984 --> 00:16.788
And there are two ways you can do that in a very polite way.

00:17.111 --> 00:20.867
First, you can send a simple, quick email to all of the participants,...

00:21.268 --> 00:25.535
...asking them to test the software, their video and microphone in advance,...

00:25.853 --> 00:30.109
...especially if this is their first time using the particular platform.

00:30.745 --> 00:34.937
One very easy sentence you can use in your email is something like:

00:35.175 --> 00:39.563
if you've never used this video platform before, we'll open the meeting room early,...

00:39.640 --> 00:42.624
...so that you have time to test your microphone...

00:42.734 --> 00:45.140
...and your video before the meeting starts.

00:45.601 --> 00:48.031
Secondly, it's important to follow through with that...

00:48.502 --> 00:52.873
...and make sure that you're able to open the meeting five or 10 minutes early,...

00:53.181 --> 00:55.463
...give your participants time to get set up.

00:55.871 --> 00:59.365
Rather than just having a blank screen while your participants join,...

00:59.881 --> 01:03.148
...you could create a slide or an image in advance...

01:03.334 --> 01:07.279
...and share that with your participants so that they see a note...

01:07.455 --> 01:12.343
...that says: "We will start our meeting..." or "We will start our discussion right on time."

01:12.495 --> 01:16.780
"Please be sure to test your microphone and your video before the meeting starts."

01:17.209 --> 01:21.173
In addition to making sure everything technical is prepared for in advance,...

01:21.521 --> 01:24.964
...the second thing you can do in this phase is to review the agenda...

01:25.162 --> 01:27.103
...and share that in advance as well.

01:27.641 --> 01:30.685
If you have others who will be contributing to the discussion...

01:30.779 --> 01:35.008
...or that you know you will ask to share some key details,...

01:35.319 --> 01:37.017
...let them know in advance.

01:37.269 --> 01:42.513
Give them time to be prepared so that they can be concise and clear in the meeting.
