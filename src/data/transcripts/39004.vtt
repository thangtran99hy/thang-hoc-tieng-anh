If you're the host of the discussion, and there are participants who are new to you,...

00:04.513 --> 00:07.381
...you should definitely introduce yourself at the beginning.

00:07.531 --> 00:10.794
The same is true for anyone who may be presenting, speaking,...

00:10.881 --> 00:14.174
...or contributing significantly to the discussion.

00:14.706 --> 00:17.319
Because it's important to get right to the agenda,...

00:17.551 --> 00:21.059
...you want to make sure that the introductions are quick and concise.

00:21.409 --> 00:24.177
So, here are two simple formulas to help you do that.

00:24.583 --> 00:28.072
If you're hosting a professional meeting, you could use something like,...

00:28.497 --> 00:31.678
"Hi, everyone. I'm Annemarie, the director of Speak Confident English...

00:31.748 --> 00:33.860
...and I'll be your host for the discussion today."

00:34.312 --> 00:36.620
Or "Good morning, everyone. I'm Lina,...

00:36.900 --> 00:41.680
I'm a junior analyst at KPMG and I'll be leading the discussion today."

00:42.244 --> 00:43.505
Do you notice in both of those,...

00:43.577 --> 00:46.949
...I'm including the name, the title or job position...

00:47.039 --> 00:49.373
...and the organization where someone works.
