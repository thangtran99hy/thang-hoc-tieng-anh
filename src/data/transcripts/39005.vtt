00:00.050 --> 00:02.986
From time to time, individuals ask questions...

00:03.063 --> 00:07.781
...that take you away from the main discussion or get you off-topic.

00:08.252 --> 00:10.678
And here's what you can say to manage this:...

00:11.079 --> 00:12.379
That's a great question,...

00:12.501 --> 00:15.537
...but I want to make sure that we have time to get through our full agenda.

00:15.799 --> 00:17.793
So, let's come back to it at the end today.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.545
Thanks for asking that question.

00:19.651 --> 00:22.468
I'll make sure that we save time at the end of our meeting today...

00:22.742 --> 00:25.601
...to answer any questions that are outside of the agenda.

00:25.951 --> 00:30.070
Similarly, you want to ensure that no one dominates the conversation...

00:30.363 --> 00:32.789
...or takes the conversation off-track.

00:33.265 --> 00:35.387
If you notice that someone starts to do that,...

00:35.511 --> 00:37.785
...you can jump in and say something like:...

00:38.068 --> 00:39.651
"That's a really great idea,"...

00:39.823 --> 00:41.159
...or "That's a great suggestion."

00:41.538 --> 00:42.999
"Hold on to that thought...

00:43.254 --> 00:45.991
...because I'd like to come back to it at the end of the discussion today,"...

00:46.360 --> 00:48.115
...or "I appreciate your comment, Sue."

00:48.182 --> 00:49.306
"That's a really good point."

00:49.517 --> 00:51.252
"Let's see what others have to say on that."

00:51.877 --> 00:54.981
And lastly, if you know there's just a little bit of time left...

00:55.059 --> 00:58.522
...and you still have topics that you need to discuss on your agenda,...

00:58.808 --> 01:00.284
...you can say something like:...

01:00.395 --> 01:01.877
We are almost at the end of the meeting.

01:01.963 --> 01:04.638
So, let's try to get through the last three items.

01:05.025 --> 01:08.767
This will help everyone return their focus to the meeting agenda.
