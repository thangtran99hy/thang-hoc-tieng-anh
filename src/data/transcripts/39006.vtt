The fifth scenario that you need to be prepared for...

00:02.907 --> 00:06.727
...is how to handle interruptions because they will happen.

00:07.157 --> 00:10.627
It might be a dog barking, someone at the door knocking, a baby crying,..

00:10.707 --> 00:14.992
...construction outside your window, or some unexpected technical issue.

00:15.852 --> 00:19.487
When any of those things happen, here are some ways to handle it.

00:20.034 --> 00:20.848
"I'm so sorry."

00:20.927 --> 00:23.137
"You'll have to forgive the noise in the background."

00:23.737 --> 00:25.206
"Could you come back to me in a moment?"

00:25.281 --> 00:27.676
"I need to put myself on mute for a second."

00:28.279 --> 00:31.197
If someone interrupts you, you can respond with:

00:31.487 --> 00:34.059
"Sorry, let me finish my thought and then you can go ahead."

00:34.529 --> 00:35.931
Or "One moment, please."

00:36.003 --> 00:38.505
"I'd like to mention one more thing before we move on."

00:39.123 --> 00:41.758
Sometimes, interruptions are caused by technical issues...

00:41.830 --> 00:43.773
...that are completely out of our control,...

00:44.244 --> 00:48.993
...and we may even lose the ability to stay connected to the online meeting.

00:49.430 --> 00:54.415
In those situations, it is always a good practice to let everyone know what's happening.

00:54.660 --> 00:56.147
You can send a message in the chat...

00:56.480 --> 00:59.023
...to let everyone know you're having a technical difficulty...

00:59.203 --> 01:01.145
...or if necessary, send an email.

01:01.581 --> 01:05.958
When you do that, always let them know what you plan to do going ahead.

01:06.351 --> 01:10.139
If you're a participant, you can let the host know that you'll review the notes.

01:10.639 --> 01:12.547
If you're the host or the leader,...
