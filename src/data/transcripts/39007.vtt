00:00.366 --> 00:03.363
So, the course would cost 4,200 dollars...

00:04.043 --> 00:06.841
...and that's for the design and then to run it for the two groups.

00:07.727 --> 00:10.031
That's a little bit more than we have budgeted for.

00:10.144 --> 00:12.564
Is there any way you could reduce it just a little bit?

00:14.225 --> 00:15.716
Well, I think it is a good price.

00:17.893 --> 00:24.109
Maybe if we had an agreement that you would have 12 people or fewer on each course,...

00:24.195 --> 00:26.054
...that would save me a little bit of cost.

00:26.134 --> 00:28.058
I could do it for 4,100 then.

00:29.197 --> 00:30.584
It's still a little bit high.

00:31.261 --> 00:35.625
What if we were to book this date for several programs spread over the next two years?

00:36.001 --> 00:37.406
How much cheaper would that be?

00:39.081 --> 00:41.973
Well, running it several times would bring the cost down a little bit.

00:42.849 --> 00:47.041
If you book three, I could bring it down to 3,840.

00:48.910 --> 00:51.770
But, if you wanted to bring it down a bit more, I had an idea.

00:52.753 --> 00:55.766
If you could refer to me on your website, recommend me on there,...

00:56.124 --> 01:00.361
...and if I could refer to you on my website as a customer,...

01:01.076 --> 01:04.573
...then I could bring it down to 3,660. How about that?

01:05.467 --> 01:08.485
Okay, what if we were to provide you with all of the printing...

01:08.577 --> 01:10.733
....and gave you a really great lunch every day?

01:10.915 --> 01:13.837
What would be the absolute best you could do it for?

01:14.426 --> 01:15.969
Well, the lunch would be nice.

01:17.141 --> 01:19.418
The printing doesn't make a lot of difference to my costs.

01:19.562 --> 01:21.987
But, I suppose it would make it a little bit cheaper to run.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.401
So, if you did the printing and provided the lunch as well,...

01:25.473 --> 01:29.571
...then I could bring it down to 3,620.

01:30.174 --> 01:31.753
How about we go ahead on that basis?

01:32.191 --> 01:33.065
That's a good deal.

01:33.213 --> 01:33.787
Let's do it.

01:33.971 --> 01:34.489
Excellent.
