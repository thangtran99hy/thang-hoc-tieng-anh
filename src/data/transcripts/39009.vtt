00:00.050 --> 00:02.127
I thought you'd be excited to have an acting job.

00:02.346 --> 00:04.247
If it's an acting job, we should get paid.

00:04.639 --> 00:06.897
Yeah, you're gonna get paid in experience.

00:07.217 --> 00:08.642
I wanna actually get paid.

00:10.464 --> 00:11.391
All right, what do you want?

00:11.557 --> 00:15.819
Six hundred dollars for the day, plus overtime if we go over eight hours.

00:16.059 --> 00:17.239
I'll do my own hair and makeup.

00:17.693 --> 00:21.913
And I want you to pay for the six-week intensive acting camp that my mom can't afford.

00:22.837 --> 00:27.189
Fifty dollars for the day and a two-week acting class at the YMCA nearest you.

00:27.535 --> 00:29.789
Five hundred dollars and a four-week acting class.

00:29.923 --> 00:32.339
Three hundred dollars and a three-week class.

00:32.987 --> 00:33.414
Done.

00:35.321 --> 00:36.942
I would have done it for 500.

00:37.690 --> 00:39.375
I would have done it for the experience.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.731
Michael, you're up. Opener?

00:44.441 --> 00:48.147
I want you to take me to Hawaii so I can swim with the dolphins.

00:48.263 --> 00:50.008
You're not gonna let that one go, are you?

00:50.168 --> 00:52.083
We're not going to Hawaii, pal. Anything else?

00:52.230 --> 00:53.426
Find someone else then.

01:00.282 --> 01:02.388
The Mafia staredown.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.362
Very good, Michael.

01:04.447 --> 01:05.585
We're here to negotiate.

01:05.709 --> 01:07.469
Do you have anything else you might like?

01:08.314 --> 01:09.383
I want a flying pony.

01:09.697 --> 01:12.266
I want a flying pony too, Michael, but they don't exist.

01:12.933 --> 01:14.394
Then I want a regular pony.

01:14.497 --> 01:15.887
And I want to name him Nelson.

01:16.312 --> 01:19.100
How about a Playstation 3 and we name him Nelson?

01:19.900 --> 01:20.916
Keep talking.

01:21.313 --> 01:23.093
We'll include four video games.

01:23.252 --> 01:23.893
Five games.

01:24.312 --> 01:27.973
And I want the meeting with Blondie to be at J.D. McFunnigan's.

01:28.173 --> 01:30.468
How about Charlie Choo-Choo's because it's right down the street from me?

01:30.911 --> 01:33.278
Mention that slop hole again and I walk.

01:33.503 --> 01:35.687
All right, take it easy, son. Take it easy.

01:36.023 --> 01:38.005
And I want unlimited tokens.

01:38.278 --> 01:40.430
If I can spend 'em, I wanna have 'em.

01:40.795 --> 01:44.397
I don't wanna be like playing Skee-Ball and all of a sudden run out of tokens.

01:45.040 --> 01:46.649
All right, I can make that happen.

01:47.345 --> 01:48.289
So, do we have a deal?

01:52.055 --> 01:52.608
Deal.
