Lamborghini is bringing back the most famous name in the Italian automaker's history,...

00:04.773 --> 00:08.789
...Countach, and this time it's on an all-new hybrid supercar.

00:09.027 --> 00:12.804
So, it's the interpretation of the Countach of the 21st century.

00:13.067 --> 00:17.449
It's a beautiful car but there's also new technology inside...

00:17.800 --> 00:21.337
...and the super capacitor is a battery...

00:21.441 --> 00:26.313
...which has three times more power than a normal battery and attached to the gearbox.

00:26.681 --> 00:27.669
In terms of layout,...

00:27.757 --> 00:33.943
...you have the engine positioned in the longitudinal in the back of the car...

00:34.023 --> 00:35.769
...so the cabin moved forward.

00:36.251 --> 00:40.977
And for the V12, since the Countach for the first time, we have the scissor doors.

00:41.054 --> 00:43.471
So, it's really a game changer for Lamborghini.

00:43.557 --> 00:47.570
And therefore, even if we don't do normally retro cars,...

00:47.935 --> 00:50.474
...for this car we made an exception.

00:51.837 --> 00:53.669
We have people who are collectors...

00:53.755 --> 00:57.393
...and they finally see also a modern version and they want to have it...

00:57.751 --> 00:59.773
...because it is here a bit last of a kind.

01:00.287 --> 01:05.313
And, on the other hand, we have older grown-up kids...

01:05.409 --> 01:08.771
...which used to have a poster on their wall in the 80s...

01:08.859 --> 01:11.660
...when this car was becoming very famous.
