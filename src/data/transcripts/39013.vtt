Melbourne has been the most livable city in the world for the past seven years.

00:09.662 --> 00:13.668
But this year it lost the top spot to Vienna.

00:14.483 --> 00:17.993
Home to Strauss and Schubert and famous for its coffee houses,...

00:18.309 --> 00:22.525
...Vienna scored an almost perfect 99.1%.

00:26.709 --> 00:28.531
But what makes a city livable?

00:29.723 --> 00:32.831
The Economist Intelligence Unit has been analyzing this.

00:33.625 --> 00:38.901
It has ranked 140 cities according to stability, education,...

00:39.224 --> 00:42.965
...healthcare, infrastructure, and culture and environment.

00:44.321 --> 00:48.554
Most livable cities tend to be midsized in wealthy countries...

00:48.705 --> 00:50.897
...and with low population densities.

00:53.029 --> 00:56.841
Copenhagen is the only other European city in the top 10.

00:57.242 --> 01:01.310
Australia and Canada each have three cities and Japan two.

01:03.107 --> 01:07.329
Western Europe and North America are the most livable regions in the world.

01:07.709 --> 01:09.888
The Middle East and Africa the least.

01:10.505 --> 01:12.191
While Asia and Australasia...

01:12.294 --> 01:16.145
...are home to some of the world's most livable and unlivable cities.
