00:00.103 --> 00:01.875
Have you experienced deja vu?

00:02.295 --> 00:05.917
It's that shadowy feeling you get when a situation seems familiar.

00:06.398 --> 00:09.222
A scene in a restaurant plays out exactly as you remember.

00:09.416 --> 00:11.841
The world moves like a ballet you've choreographed,...

00:12.117 --> 00:14.650
...but the sequence can't be based on a past experience...

00:14.785 --> 00:16.407
...because you've never eaten here before.

00:16.825 --> 00:20.099
This is the first time you've had clams, so what's going on?

00:20.519 --> 00:24.044
Unfortunately, there isn't one single explanation for deja vu.

00:24.271 --> 00:26.920
The experience is brief and occurs without notice,...

00:27.101 --> 00:30.333
...making it nearly impossible for scientists to record and study it.

00:30.555 --> 00:33.562
Scientists can't simply sit around and wait for it to happen to them.

00:33.742 --> 00:34.837
This could take years.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.097
It has no physical manifestations...

00:37.195 --> 00:41.047
...and in studies, it's described by the subject as a sensation or feeling.

00:41.493 --> 00:43.273
Because of this lack of hard evidence,...

00:43.509 --> 00:45.989
...there's been a surplus of speculation over the years.

00:46.129 --> 00:50.826
Since Emile Boirac introduced deja vu as a French term meaning "already seen,"...

00:51.131 --> 00:53.991
...more than 40 theories attempt to explain this phenomenon.

00:54.356 --> 00:58.297
Still, recent advancements in neuroimaging and cognitive psychology...

00:58.502 --> 01:00.263
...narrow down the field of prospects.

01:00.607 --> 01:03.130
Let's walk through three of today's more prevalent theories,...

01:03.379 --> 01:05.433
...using the same restaurant setting for each.

01:05.665 --> 01:07.322
First up is dual processing.

01:07.600 --> 01:08.463
We'll need an action.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.951
Let's go with a waiter dropping a tray of dishes.

01:11.325 --> 01:15.379
As the scene unfolds, your brain's hemispheres process a flurry of information:

01:15.761 --> 01:19.333
the waiter's flailing arms, his cry for help, the smell of pasta.

01:19.719 --> 01:22.715
Within milliseconds, this information zips through pathways...

01:22.804 --> 01:24.804
...and is processed into a single moment.

01:25.145 --> 01:27.443
Most of the time, everything is recorded in sync.

01:27.775 --> 01:30.574
However, this theory asserts that deja vu occurs...

01:30.836 --> 01:33.982
...when there's a slight delay in information from one of these pathways.

01:34.129 --> 01:35.460
The difference in arrival times...

01:35.546 --> 01:39.056
...causes the brain to interpret the late information as a separate event.

01:39.747 --> 01:41.927
When it plays over the already recorded moment,...

01:42.031 --> 01:45.572
...it feels as if it's happened before because, in a sense, it has.
