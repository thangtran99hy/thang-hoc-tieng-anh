That is, if you don't have the liver to engage in a textual brawl.

00:09.841 --> 00:14.311
To consider a city livable, you must look at how clean the water and air is.

00:14.610 --> 00:17.555
You also need to consider the availability of food and shelter,...

00:17.813 --> 00:20.570
...communality and hospitality of the city's communities,...

00:20.797 --> 00:23.116
...how easy for the youth to develop social skills,...

00:23.345 --> 00:27.537
...and the depth of the sense of identity and autonomy are all important indicators.

00:27.955 --> 00:31.928
Availability, accessibility and stability of culture and infrastructure...

00:32.027 --> 00:33.813
...are also big factors combined.

00:36.690 --> 00:39.289
...as given by Monocle's most livable cities index,...

...the Economist Intelligence Unit, global livability ranking...

00:42.477 --> 00:44.419

00:44.671 --> 00:48.027
...you'll find Vienna, the capital and largest city of Austria,...

00:48.223 --> 00:52.217

...which is nearly one-third of the country's population,...

01:03.692 --> 01:06.530
...is the cultural, economic and political center.

01:07.611 --> 01:08.985

...has continued to compete among the top 10.

01:16.375 --> 01:18.515
You can rate it high with the environmental metric...

...after establishing a strict and aggressive zero carbon emissions goal.

01:23.293 --> 01:24.446

This Australian city with its 98.1 percent score...

01:28.866 --> 01:31.485
...has been on the list of the top 10 for some years.

01:32.044 --> 01:34.363
It scores high on environmental efficiencies.

01:35.613 --> 01:37.053
