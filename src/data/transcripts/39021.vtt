Well, I certainly have lost many battles.

00:03.585 --> 00:06.344
So far, I've not lost a war but I've certainly lost many battles.

00:06.591 --> 00:08.847
Oh yeah, more than I can count probably.

00:09.631 --> 00:13.502
I don't really like risk for risk's sake or anything.

00:14.369 --> 00:22.139
And I do think that early things are very risky with a low chance of success,...

00:22.394 --> 00:26.120
...but if you want to try to come up with an innovative breakthrough,...

00:26.959 --> 00:28.801
...that's kind of gonna be how it is.

00:30.638 --> 00:33.791
Anything which is significantly innovative...

00:33.919 --> 00:35.943
...is going to come with a significant risk of failure.

00:39.015 --> 00:41.182
But you've got to take big chances...

00:41.270 --> 00:44.523
...in order for the potential for a big positive outcome.
