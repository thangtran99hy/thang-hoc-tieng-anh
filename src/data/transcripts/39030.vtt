So, I live here in Boston,...

00:02.789 --> 00:08.343
...and I am super passionate about digital media and publishing and new technologies.

00:08.715 --> 00:13.163
And in terms of my own life, I am a novel seeker,...

00:13.301 --> 00:15.129
...or I always look for the new thing.

00:15.223 --> 00:22.563
I'm always up on current events and trends and almost like I'm a commitment-phobe,...

00:22.648 --> 00:25.437
...but not like in a bad way, because I really want to commit to your company.

00:25.905 --> 00:31.162
And you know, I love nothing more than to work hard,...

00:31.261 --> 00:33.961
...but also go home and cook a really good meal,...

00:34.038 --> 00:35.734
...because food is like a big part of my life.

00:37.188 --> 00:38.852
Clearly, I could use some help.

00:39.431 --> 00:44.552
Luckily, an expert wrote about this very topic and a question for hbr.org.

00:44.916 --> 00:47.735
Joel Schwartzberg is a professional presentation coach.

00:47.939 --> 00:51.230
So, I decided, why don't I talk to him directly and see what he could do.
