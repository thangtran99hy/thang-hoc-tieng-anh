00:00.050 --> 00:02.025
Is there any specific things you would tell me?

00:02.223 --> 00:05.194
Like things I should say when I go into that next interview?

00:05.318 --> 00:10.736
I would do an audit of your personality traits that match and your skills that match.

00:10.819 --> 00:13.245
Literally, write them down on a piece of paper.

00:13.351 --> 00:15.418
If you're interested in a job, there will be connections.

00:15.847 --> 00:21.277
Friendly, generous, divergent, darkly funny, creative (in capital letters),...

00:21.518 --> 00:23.375
...curious, competitive and collaborative.

00:23.543 --> 00:24.291
Do your homework.

00:24.792 --> 00:29.094
Make sure you know about not only the job description but the company itself.

00:29.215 --> 00:33.597
One thing I really recommend is you do what I call effective practice.

00:34.484 --> 00:35.437
And you don't need a mirror.

00:35.549 --> 00:36.509
You don't need a friend.

00:36.580 --> 00:38.539
You could do it in your closet or your bathroom.

00:38.905 --> 00:43.148
Just several times, try to practice getting those points out together...

00:43.231 --> 00:45.910
...in a very confident, clear and simple way.

00:46.515 --> 00:50.767
So, I think I worked pretty hard this week and I hope you're proud, so...

00:50.866 --> 00:53.100
But I'm already proud of you, so don't worry about that part.

00:53.209 --> 00:56.425
Number two is, I guess that leaves one question.

00:56.715 --> 01:00.814
And that is: Christine, why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself?

01:01.308 --> 01:05.469
Certainly. So, as you can see, I've been an editor for a while.

01:05.787 --> 01:08.151
And I love working in teams...

01:08.260 --> 01:13.415
...to tell a story very creatively and intelligently to our readers.

01:13.505 --> 01:15.870
But also, make it make sense for the business.

01:15.953 --> 01:20.067
And I work really well and collaborate with people from all over the organization.

01:20.150 --> 01:21.660
I think I'm a pretty friendly person.

01:22.118 --> 01:25.193
And it's really important that I establish trust with others.

01:25.293 --> 01:27.740
I know that one of your company core values...

01:28.050 --> 01:31.096
...is creative intelligence and productive teamwork.

01:31.235 --> 01:33.601
And for that reason, I think that I'd be great for this job.

01:34.446 --> 01:35.767
That's terrific, Christine.
