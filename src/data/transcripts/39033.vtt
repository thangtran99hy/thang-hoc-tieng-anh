What are your plans this summer?

00:03.049 --> 00:05.665
I will be taking English classes twice a week...

00:06.395 --> 00:09.953
...and studying for the TOEIC test. What about you?

00:10.523 --> 00:12.713
My dad owns a restaurant by the beach,...

00:12.886 --> 00:14.485
...which gets busy during the summer.

00:15.099 --> 00:17.814
He asked if I could help, and I said yes.

00:18.767 --> 00:20.173
I thought it would be good for me...

00:20.609 --> 00:23.220
...because I plan to be in the food business in the future.

00:24.009 --> 00:26.101
I will be working there on weekends.

00:26.809 --> 00:29.049
Nice. Does he need any more people?

00:29.608 --> 00:30.873
I need more money...

00:31.411 --> 00:34.117
...to pay for my classes at university this fall.

00:34.688 --> 00:36.339
That's a good idea!

00:36.921 --> 00:38.544
I'll ask my dad and let you know.

00:39.566 --> 00:41.325
That would be great. Thanks!
