Most people don't want something that's not perfect.

00:03.175 --> 00:04.125
I, on the other hand,...

00:04.229 --> 00:08.095
...look at the special needs cats as the most beautiful souls in this world.

00:09.474 --> 00:13.077
My name is Michele Hoffman, and I rescue special needs cats.

00:13.315 --> 00:16.790
I created Milo's Sanctuary 17 years ago.

00:17.012 --> 00:20.739
We have anywhere from 85 to 100 cats at one given time:...

00:21.981 --> 00:26.823
...cats that are blind, with deformities, abused, sick.

00:27.053 --> 00:29.449
They are kind of the unwanted of society,...

00:29.663 --> 00:33.792
...and so, our job is to take care of them, give them a safe place.

00:34.157 --> 00:37.513
The cats have taught me so much about life...

00:37.714 --> 00:40.110
...because they don't know that they're special needs cats.

00:40.549 --> 00:41.640
They're just cats.

00:41.868 --> 00:46.713
I love them for their goofiness, their gentleness.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.186
Being with them all the time brings me the greatest joy.

00:51.653 --> 00:56.743
I really want to take the fear out of owning a special needs cat.

00:57.146 --> 00:58.204
Empathize with them.
