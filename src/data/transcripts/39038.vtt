After I got to a certain point, I said, "There's no denying it."

00:04.611 --> 00:06.229
I am definitely a collector.

00:06.519 --> 00:07.777
My name is Linda Guillory.

00:07.917 --> 00:09.310
I'm 51 years old.

00:09.431 --> 00:10.633
I'm from North Texas...

00:10.718 --> 00:15.552
...and I have the largest collection of vintage video gaming systems in the world.

00:15.701 --> 00:21.215
So, my husband Tom did pass away in May of this year.

00:21.325 --> 00:24.991
How I knew it was true love was the fact that...

00:25.178 --> 00:30.199
...Tom did not care about video games and I still loved him.

00:30.497 --> 00:36.750
He never played one video game in his life, but I loved Tom more than I love video games.

00:37.036 --> 00:39.409
I've collected 3,000 games.

00:39.678 --> 00:41.364
I have so many favorite games:...

00:41.583 --> 00:44.132
...the Coleco tabletop series,...

00:44.369 --> 00:45.779
...King Kong tabletop,...

00:45.993 --> 00:48.735
...any sports, handheld,...

00:48.915 --> 00:50.092
...Legend of Zelda.

00:50.197 --> 00:52.046
We definitely all grieve in different ways.

00:52.234 --> 00:55.543
Gaming systems definitely bring me a sense of nostalgia.

00:55.757 --> 00:57.106
I feel that warmth.

00:57.409 --> 00:58.465
It's just joy.
