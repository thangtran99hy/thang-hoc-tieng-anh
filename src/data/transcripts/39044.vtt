For twins, Julia and Colin MeCey...

00:03.257 --> 00:06.737
...technology has helped give them an altogether different learning experience.

00:08.603 --> 00:10.658
They attend a virtual public school,...

00:11.345 --> 00:13.719
Are you taking British and world literature?

00:14.111 --> 00:17.299
...which provides them with the equipment they need to learn remotely.

00:18.201 --> 00:27.209
So, I'm taking a fine arts course, so in my box, I have clay and some paintbrushes...

00:27.313 --> 00:29.022
...and then some acrylic color paint.

00:30.694 --> 00:34.049
Julia moved to full-time remote learning during the pandemic,...

00:34.405 --> 00:39.277
...but Colin was a trailblazer, switching to e-education in 2019.

00:40.069 --> 00:46.601
The environment of a one-on-one in comparison to one-on-30 is just a lot nicer.

00:46.671 --> 00:51.189
I have a lot more contact with my teachers, and the classes that are offered...

00:51.271 --> 00:54.847
...is just so much more than what is offered at a normal public school...

00:55.153 --> 00:56.794
...like computer science, for example.

00:56.906 --> 01:00.057
I have been able to take more classes that interest me.

01:00.215 --> 01:02.044
I think my grades have been better,...

01:02.132 --> 01:06.138
...so I probably will have a better chance of getting into my dream colleges.

01:08.605 --> 01:12.195
A recent survey found that nearly a third of American parents say...

01:12.279 --> 01:16.103
...it's likely their child will continue with remote learning indefinitely.

01:16.618 --> 01:20.500
It's unclear to what extent fear of COVID has influenced this decision,...

01:20.896 --> 01:23.349
...but roughly 20% of districts in America...

01:23.465 --> 01:27.594
...are planning to offer some form of virtual learning even after the pandemic.

01:27.993 --> 01:31.937
We can all agree that most students do better when they're in the classroom,...

01:32.085 --> 01:36.184
...but for some students, having to do school remotely was a positive.

01:36.603 --> 01:41.476
Some students have anxiety issues, and it was easier to work from home, for example.
