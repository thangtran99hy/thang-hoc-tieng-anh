During the pandemic, many teachers told me that this is the first time...

00:04.343 --> 00:06.287
...they've seen so much parent engagement,...

00:06.812 --> 00:11.313
...and a lot of that is because parents are home listening to the lessons,...

00:11.641 --> 00:13.942
...but also because they are engaging technology...

00:14.059 --> 00:16.702
...that makes it easier for parents to be up to speed.

00:17.784 --> 00:22.625
Not all students can afford the space and internet connection needed to study online,...

00:22.917 --> 00:27.445
...which means increased use of remote learning risks widening the digital divide.

00:28.077 --> 00:33.909
Ultimately, the barrier to success for all EdTech, not just e-education, is financial.

00:34.597 --> 00:36.033
For EdTech to be successful,...

00:36.159 --> 00:40.105
...there needs to be investment in the schools that currently are under-resourced.

00:40.279 --> 00:46.503
There needs to be a push to make sure that these schools have the proper internet access,...

00:46.607 --> 00:52.284
...the facilities and everything else they need to be able to properly function with EdTech.

00:52.643 --> 00:53.707
If that doesn't happen,...

00:53.855 --> 00:58.542
...then we will see inequities develop in the classroom and across schools.
