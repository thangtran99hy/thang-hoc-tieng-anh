00:00.412 --> 00:03.753
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have been founded,...

00:03.915 --> 00:06.446
...just like the United Nations after World War II.

00:06.945 --> 00:07.314
Why?

00:07.678 --> 00:10.323
Mainly because after the war, everyone wanted peace.

00:10.675 --> 00:13.523
However, peace on an empty stomach is hard to maintain.

00:13.731 --> 00:17.574
So, these two institutions were meant to help the economic stability of the world.

00:18.118 --> 00:22.553
Both of them are basically banks, but instead of being started by individuals like regular banks,...

00:22.891 --> 00:24.125
...they've been started by countries.

00:24.526 --> 00:27.375
Most of the world's countries are members of the two institutions.

00:27.549 --> 00:31.162
But of course, the richest countries are those who handled most of the financing...

00:31.418 --> 00:33.792
...and ultimately those who have the greatest influence.

00:34.160 --> 00:37.617
The IMF and the World Bank were designed to complement each other.

00:37.773 --> 00:40.877
The IMF's main goal is helping countries which are currently in trouble...

00:41.073 --> 00:42.948
...and who cannot get money by other means.

00:43.373 --> 00:44.781
Perhaps their economy collapsed.

00:45.009 --> 00:46.497
Perhaps their currency is in danger.

00:46.838 --> 00:50.294
The IMF, in these cases, is kind of like a lender of last resort...

00:50.529 --> 00:52.902
...who you go to when nobody else is willing to give you money.

00:53.517 --> 00:56.455
The World Bank, in comparison, has a more long-term approach.

00:56.686 --> 00:59.483
Its main goals revolve around the eradication of poverty...

00:59.669 --> 01:04.243
...and it funds specific projects, which help them reach these goals, especially in poor countries.

01:04.679 --> 01:08.149
Unfortunately, the reputation of these institutions has been dwindling...
