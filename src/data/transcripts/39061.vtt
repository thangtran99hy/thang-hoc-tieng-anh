Hey, Jill.

00:08.593 --> 00:09.439
Hi, Sean.

00:09.836 --> 00:11.438
We really enjoyed meeting with you.

00:11.744 --> 00:14.914
The salary you're asking for, it's a little higher than average.

00:15.119 --> 00:17.409
What experience and skills do you feel support that?

00:17.541 --> 00:20.448
I've been leading one of the fastest-growing open-source projects...

00:20.694 --> 00:24.937
...and some of our contributors are developers for some of the biggest tech companies.

00:25.129 --> 00:27.377
So, I've been able to see how industry leaders operate.

00:28.431 --> 00:29.613
That's impressive.

00:30.123 --> 00:32.147
I feel you'd be a great addition to our team.

00:32.361 --> 00:34.970
We're willing to meet you in the middle and offer 95,000.

00:35.228 --> 00:36.385
I appreciate the offer.

00:37.081 --> 00:38.693
I could take on this role for that amount,...

00:39.254 --> 00:43.477
...assuming the package includes a signing bonus and two additional weeks of vacation.

00:44.093 --> 00:45.521
I think we can make that happen.

00:45.743 --> 00:46.839
I'll send you the details.
