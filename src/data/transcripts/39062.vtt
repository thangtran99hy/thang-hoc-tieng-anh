00:00.239 --> 00:01.397
So, I want to hear more.

00:02.119 --> 00:04.701
Tell me a little about your experience and what you'd bring to this role?

00:07.132 --> 00:07.832
Great question.

00:08.376 --> 00:11.763
Ever since I was young, I've always been the organized one of my family,...

00:12.195 --> 00:16.479
...whether it was helping my parents schedule vacations or color-coordinating my closet.

00:16.968 --> 00:19.581
Naturally, that lifestyle got me here, project management.

00:20.253 --> 00:22.649
I've been a people person for as long as I can remember.

00:22.835 --> 00:23.741
Plain and simple,...

00:24.139 --> 00:26.449
...I love team-building and making sure everyone has a part.

00:26.805 --> 00:28.113
I helped lead a team of five...

00:28.197 --> 00:31.057
...to deliver a three-week sales project a few days ahead of schedule.

00:31.791 --> 00:33.080
I'd love to bring these things here.
