Hi! You got a second?

00:06.192 --> 00:06.471
Okay.

00:06.859 --> 00:11.162
You remember how when we were younger we used to run around...

00:11.259 --> 00:14.971
...and hang out with Blue and find clues and talk to Mr. Salt...

00:15.103 --> 00:16.965
...and freak out about the mail and do all the fun stuff...

00:17.065 --> 00:20.251
...and then one day, I was like, "Oh hey, guess what?"

00:20.370 --> 00:21.503
"Big news! I'm leaving."

00:22.587 --> 00:24.473
"This is my brother Joe, he's your new best friend."

00:24.607 --> 00:29.900
And then I got on a bus and I left, and we didn't see each other for a really long time.

00:31.081 --> 00:32.531
Can we just talk about that?

00:35.400 --> 00:35.543
Great.

00:36.062 --> 00:38.763
Because I realized that that was kind of abrupt.

00:40.184 --> 00:47.175
I just kinda got up and went to college, and that was really challenging, by the way.

00:47.323 --> 00:51.911
But great because I got to use my mind and take a step at a time.

00:52.001 --> 00:56.204
I mean now I literally am doing many of the things that I wanted to do.

00:57.569 --> 01:00.213
And then look at you, and look at all you have done,...

01:00.368 --> 01:02.846
...and all you have accomplished in all that time...

01:03.279 --> 01:06.371
And it's just so amazing, right?

01:06.787 --> 01:11.589
I mean, we started out with clues, and now it's what?

01:12.096 --> 01:13.161
Student loans,...

01:13.443 --> 01:15.858
...and jobs,...

01:16.202 --> 01:17.054
...and families.

01:17.262 --> 01:21.183
And some of it has been kind of hard, you know?

01:21.922 --> 01:22.715
I know you know.

01:24.488 --> 01:30.312
I wanted to tell you that I really couldn't have done all of that without your help.

01:32.513 --> 01:36.397
And in fact, all the help that you helped me with when we were younger...

01:36.522 --> 01:38.652
...is still helping me today.

01:39.204 --> 01:39.667
Right now.

01:40.271 --> 01:41.223
And that's super cool.

01:41.856 --> 01:48.711
I guess I just wanted to say that after all these years I never forgot you ever.

01:50.130 --> 01:51.983
And I'm super glad we're still friends.

01:52.883 --> 01:53.695
Thanks for listening.

01:54.633 --> 01:56.537
You look great, by the way.

01:57.557 --> 01:58.977
Whatever it is you're doing, it's working.
