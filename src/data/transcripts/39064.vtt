00:03.567 --> 00:08.312
20 years ago, our world changed forever.

00:10.041 --> 00:14.729
A sunny morning became one of our darkest days.

00:17.133 --> 00:19.146
When there was nothing we could say,...

00:20.406 --> 00:25.063
...we did all we could to search for answers...

00:25.998 --> 00:31.719
...and meaning to somehow find our way.

00:34.582 --> 00:40.621
It was in these moments that we realized the power of our own strength.

00:41.447 --> 00:45.598
And together, the strength of our collective power.

00:46.152 --> 00:52.421
Two decades later, we see a city that defines perseverance,...

00:53.334 --> 00:56.297
...rebuilt through courage,...

00:57.125 --> 00:59.768
...resolve and triumph.

01:01.930 --> 01:07.561
Today and forever, we remember those who can't be here with us.

01:08.855 --> 01:11.319
And honor those who protect us.

01:12.698 --> 01:17.621
And as we look ahead, we will always hold these stories...

01:18.309 --> 01:22.551
...and these memories in our hearts...

01:23.899 --> 01:31.652
...and in our minds and vow to never ever forget.
