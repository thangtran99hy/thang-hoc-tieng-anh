One thing young people do more than anybody of other age demographic is that,...

00:05.272 --> 00:07.671
...young people associate a whole lot.

00:08.125 --> 00:12.565
Unfortunately, most people are not conscious of who they hang out with.

00:13.245 --> 00:18.520
If your associates are not ambitious or positive about life, you can't be.

00:19.073 --> 00:20.902
If your friends don't know more than you,...

00:21.100 --> 00:23.833
...you are never going to grow and become a better person.

00:24.615 --> 00:26.080
So what should you do?

00:26.591 --> 00:30.534
Cut yourself off from negative and unmotivated people.

00:31.279 --> 00:36.244
Choose your friends carefully because you can't be better than who you associate with.
