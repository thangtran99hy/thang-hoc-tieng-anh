The lobby is sort of like your entry to your home.

00:04.256 --> 00:07.611
You get a sense of both the company and its brand and what they stand for...

00:08.415 --> 00:10.571
...as well as making somebody feel welcome and received.

00:11.547 --> 00:12.578
When we have visitors come in,...

00:12.661 --> 00:14.807
...I want there to be a little bit of a wow factor...

00:14.913 --> 00:17.789
...and I want them to see it's a very efficient, very smooth,...

00:17.873 --> 00:19.711
...very welcoming experience for them.

00:20.215 --> 00:24.191
We used to check in people with a paper book.

00:24.351 --> 00:27.491
We used to have to handwrite their name and write their email address.

00:27.667 --> 00:32.115
We lost a lot of opportunity to actually do much more with somebody coming to visit.

00:33.966 --> 00:37.019
Right now, with Envoy, people walk in, they swipe,...

00:37.126 --> 00:39.391
...they enter a couple of details and they're ready to go.

00:39.662 --> 00:43.074
It just makes the process faster, more efficient...

00:43.254 --> 00:44.614
...and that makes my life a lot easier.

00:44.897 --> 00:46.711
As soon as someone checks in with Envoy,...

00:46.825 --> 00:48.975
...and I get something on my phone right away no matter where I am.

00:49.370 --> 00:50.795
There's no guessing if they're here yet.

00:50.882 --> 00:54.692
I don't need to have them text me or have the office administrators track me down.

00:55.316 --> 00:59.662
I can rely on my phone pushing a notification and I can greet my guest at the elevator.
