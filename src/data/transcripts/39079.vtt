00:00.313 --> 00:04.102
So, when is a form of speech considered a dialect versus a language?

00:04.443 --> 00:08.011
It seems reasonable that the degree of mutual intelligibility...

00:08.261 --> 00:10.379
...would determine whether two ways of speaking...

00:10.503 --> 00:14.511
...are classified as separate languages or as dialects of the same language.

00:14.858 --> 00:18.165
But as we've seen, there are many occasions where this is not the case.

00:18.595 --> 00:22.212
Perhaps surprisingly, the distinction between a language and a dialect...

00:22.411 --> 00:26.199
...usually has nothing to do with pronunciation, vocabulary,...

00:26.330 --> 00:28.231
...or any other linguistic features.

00:28.583 --> 00:31.009
However, it's not coincidental, either.

00:31.346 --> 00:32.733
It's a matter of politics.

00:33.539 --> 00:36.265
The basis for what's officially deemed a language...

00:36.339 --> 00:41.036
...was shaped by the emergence of a European nation states beginning around the 1500s.

00:41.414 --> 00:44.587
In order to establish and maintain centralized governments,...

00:44.933 --> 00:48.928
...clear territorial boundaries, and state-sponsored education systems,...

00:49.202 --> 00:52.205
...many nation states promoted a standardized language.

00:52.637 --> 00:55.619
Which form of speech was chosen to be the standard language...

00:55.823 --> 00:58.555
...was usually based on what people spoke in the capital.

00:59.041 --> 01:03.357
And while other forms of speech persisted, they were often treated as inferior.

01:04.047 --> 01:07.897
This tradition extended across the globe with European colonization...

01:08.162 --> 01:09.536
...and into modern times.

01:10.002 --> 01:14.844
Italy, for example, has at least 15 of what might be called regional dialects.

01:15.170 --> 01:17.288
One of them, the Florentine dialect,...

01:17.519 --> 01:23.104
...became known as Standard Italian when the country politically unified in 1861.

01:23.502 --> 01:27.508
It was selected because legendary authors like Dante and Machiavelli...

01:27.757 --> 01:29.544
...used it in their original works.

01:29.763 --> 01:33.613
And it came to represent an image of Italian national identity...

01:33.897 --> 01:36.155
...that some found particularly desirable.

01:36.499 --> 01:40.645
Later on, in his attempt to establish a unified, fascist state,...

01:40.838 --> 01:45.123
...Italian dictator Benito Mussolini saw language standardization...

01:45.421 --> 01:46.919
...as an important objective.

01:47.395 --> 01:49.353
His government promoted standard Italian...

01:49.530 --> 01:52.452
...while prohibiting other forms of speech from the public sphere,...

01:52.798 --> 01:55.967
...framing them as backward and unsophisticated.
