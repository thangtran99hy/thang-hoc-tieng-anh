00:02.489 --> 00:04.504
In terms of Samsung Cambridge and Samsung Mobile,...

00:04.603 --> 00:06.499
...what we're trying to do over the past few years...

00:06.827 --> 00:09.687
...is to build a culture which holds people together.

00:09.889 --> 00:12.107
That blend of startup versus big corporate...

00:12.224 --> 00:15.413
...trying to take the best from both worlds has really been our aim.

00:18.140 --> 00:19.471
This is ground zero.

00:19.660 --> 00:21.474
This is really where it is happening.

00:21.585 --> 00:23.998
It's an absolute privilege to work here.

00:24.340 --> 00:27.500
This is where the cleverest minds in the country come.

00:27.717 --> 00:30.916
I think there can be a misconception of the big Samsung brand...

00:31.007 --> 00:33.326
...that we're very corporate and everyone has to wear suits to work.

00:33.776 --> 00:35.841
We're not like that in any way, shape or form.

00:35.941 --> 00:38.185
It is the definition of a Cambridge startup...

00:38.332 --> 00:41.324
...and that's what we've tried to put into our office refurb as well.

00:41.681 --> 00:46.667
Samsung supports us with the environment by treating us not as a number.

00:46.791 --> 00:48.781
It makes your working life a lot easier.

00:48.925 --> 00:52.593
I've worked in many companies in my life, but the philosophy is totally different.

00:52.692 --> 00:54.257
This is family orientated.

00:54.587 --> 00:57.291
It's a work-life balance and I appreciate that.
