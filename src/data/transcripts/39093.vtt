It's Teacher Appreciation week.

00:01.943 --> 00:04.254
Are there any teachers you would like to apologize to?

00:04.615 --> 00:05.275
Sure.

00:05.405 --> 00:06.781
My 5th grade teacher.

00:07.009 --> 00:08.745
Her name was Miss Glasser.

00:09.467 --> 00:13.353
I gave her the nickname "Gassy Goo," and it stuck with her the whole year.

00:13.487 --> 00:17.742
I apologize to my kindergarten teacher for kicking her every day.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.415
Almost every day.

00:19.551 --> 00:21.393
I would come in and kick her for no reason.

00:22.325 --> 00:28.140
And after that, in first grade, my first grade teacher, I would hit her with a rubber band and paper.

00:29.131 --> 00:29.985
So, things got worse.

00:30.135 --> 00:30.443
Yeah.

00:30.896 --> 00:34.100
There was a teacher at Tesoro High School in Orange County...

00:34.517 --> 00:39.103
...who had very, very big curly hair, and when she turned around to write on the board,...

00:39.415 --> 00:43.552
...we would roll up little pieces  of paper and see how many we could stick in her hair....

00:43.697 --> 00:45.247
...without her knowing.
