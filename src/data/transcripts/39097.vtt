Stress is something that we all experience sometimes.

00:04.281 --> 00:06.307
When problems and pressures get too much,...

00:06.673 --> 00:09.471
...we can start to feel overwhelmed and struggle to cope.

00:10.926 --> 00:14.343
Everyday pressures like work, money and family worries...

00:14.623 --> 00:16.393
...can place huge demands on us,...

00:17.331 --> 00:21.429
...as can big life events like losing your job, family breakdown...

00:21.613 --> 00:23.111
...or the death of someone close.

00:25.270 --> 00:28.811
The Stress Bucket is a helpful way of thinking about your problems...

00:29.139 --> 00:32.556
...and finding different ways of looking at what's causing your stress.

00:33.902 --> 00:35.711
Imagine that you carry a bucket with you.

00:36.679 --> 00:41.087
As the day goes by, different problems and demands fill up your bucket.

00:42.322 --> 00:47.102
When your bucket overflows, the stress can make you angry, anxious or sad.

00:48.588 --> 00:52.625
The good news is there are things that you can do to manage these problems...

00:52.849 --> 00:54.594
...and stop your bucket overflowing.

00:56.637 --> 01:00.364
Try and exercise a bit more, eat well and get more sleep.

01:02.261 --> 01:06.050
Get support by talking to someone you trust and telling them how you feel.

01:07.834 --> 01:11.561
Make a list to help break problems down and think about your priorities.

01:12.275 --> 01:14.949
What smaller tasks should you tackle first?

01:16.655 --> 01:19.392
Try the relaxation ideas on the Mindwell website.

01:19.875 --> 01:20.877
Take a short break.

01:21.437 --> 01:25.164
Practise breathing techniques and find the things that work for you.

01:26.555 --> 01:28.919
Making these small changes can feel good,...

01:29.548 --> 01:32.842
...like turning on a tap to release some of the pressure you're feeling.
