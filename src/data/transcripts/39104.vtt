00:01.978 --> 00:06.771
The first citizen astronaut crew safely splashed down off the coast of Florida on Saturday...

00:06.903 --> 00:10.754
...after a three-day flight in SpaceX's Resilience spacecraft.

00:11.228 --> 00:13.386
It was the first launch into Earth's orbit...

00:13.485 --> 00:18.066
...without a career astronaut on board in an effort to ramp up space tourism.

00:20.593 --> 00:22.400
Applause was heard from mission control...

00:22.576 --> 00:27.108
...as the SpaceX capsule parachuted into calm seas shortly before sunset.

00:27.757 --> 00:30.432
Within an hour, the four crew members were seen smiling,...

00:30.539 --> 00:32.399
...emerging from the capsule's side hatch.

00:32.752 --> 00:35.117
Each waved and gave a thumbs up to the cameras.

00:35.543 --> 00:38.581
They were cheered again as they stepped onto the deck of the recovery ship.

00:41.319 --> 00:45.019
The amateur astronauts were then flown by helicopter back to land...

00:45.134 --> 00:46.563
...to reunite with loved ones.

00:47.313 --> 00:50.400
On board Resilience was 29-year-old physician assistant...

00:50.507 --> 00:53.635
...and childhood bone cancer survivor Haley Arsenault,...

00:53.797 --> 00:56.534
...who became the youngest person to ever reach Earth's orbit.

00:56.855 --> 00:59.613
Alongside her was a former NASA astronaut candidate,...

00:59.795 --> 01:04.181
...an air force veteran and a billionaire who paid for the tickets, Jared Isaacman.

01:04.695 --> 01:09.537
Their successful mission marked the debut flight of SpaceX's new astrotourism business.

01:10.043 --> 01:14.266
Time Magazine estimates Isaacman paid roughly 200 million dollars...

01:14.377 --> 01:16.044
...for the four spaceflight tickets.
