Globally, the fashion industry produces 13 million tons of textile waste.

00:05.150 --> 00:08.434
I capture it before it goes to the landfill and give it a new life.

00:08.977 --> 00:14.005
I've spent so many years building my reputation as an environmental scientist.

00:14.125 --> 00:17.139
It was hard for me to actually leave and start my own business.

00:17.409 --> 00:18.771
Everyone thought I was a little crazy.

00:18.857 --> 00:22.955
Maybe I had a lot of doubts in the beginning, but I knew I could make an impact.

00:23.393 --> 00:28.775
Everything we do at Two Days Off is focused on sustainability and ethical practices.

00:28.950 --> 00:33.823
We use fully compostable or 100% recycled paper packaging.

00:34.046 --> 00:36.331
We only work with natural fibers.

00:36.424 --> 00:38.170
We do very small batches,...

00:38.483 --> 00:41.242
...and so this allows us to really manage our own waste...

00:41.344 --> 00:43.739
...and be as lean and efficient as possible.

00:44.009 --> 00:45.816
We're 100% carbon-neutral.

00:46.325 --> 00:48.814
I'm Gina Stovall, a former geologist...

00:48.949 --> 00:51.383
...and founder of sustainable clothing line Two Days Off.

00:51.530 --> 00:55.587
Providing options in sustainable fashion is one of the many solutions we need...

00:55.693 --> 00:57.377
...in order to solve climate change.
