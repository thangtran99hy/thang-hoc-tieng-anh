00:03.820 --> 00:06.711
Home to one of the worst nuclear disasters in history,...

00:06.861 --> 00:10.681
...Chernobyl is a fascinating look at how a city can change in an instant.

00:10.956 --> 00:14.373
Today, we are headed out from Kiev, Ukraine, to explore this place for ourselves.

00:15.591 --> 00:18.997
This was considered to be one of the worst nuclear disasters in history.

00:19.085 --> 00:22.317
They had to evacuate over 150,000 people.

00:24.307 --> 00:28.461
This is a memorial to the first responders, most of them being firefighters.

00:28.617 --> 00:31.285
It's actually called "To the people who saved the world,"...

00:31.381 --> 00:34.272
...and I'm imagining how brave they must have been.

00:39.115 --> 00:40.253
We're given a Geiger counter...

00:40.357 --> 00:43.552
...and this measures how much radiation we're taking in at each location.

00:43.922 --> 00:46.369
The amount of radiation we're getting throughout the entire day...

00:46.447 --> 00:50.639
...is actually less than a dental x-ray, so we are pretty safe here.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.315
We've just arrived in Pripyat,...

00:53.400 --> 00:58.025
...and this is the city where around 50,000 people were evacuated after the explosion.

00:59.970 --> 01:01.517
It's kind of surreal being here.

01:01.627 --> 01:04.023
It feels like we're in this post-apocalyptic ghost town,...

01:04.520 --> 01:08.959
...and it's kind of hard to imagine what this city would have looked like in its glory days.
