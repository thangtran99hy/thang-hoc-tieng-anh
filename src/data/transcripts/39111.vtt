00:00.337 --> 00:02.135
Hey, thanks for making time.

00:02.528 --> 00:04.583
Did you have a chance to read through my email?

00:04.825 --> 00:07.995
Absolutely! But before we dive in, I wanted to ask:...

00:08.177 --> 00:10.355
You're usually pretty quiet during our team meetings...

00:10.449 --> 00:12.410
...and then you follow up after, like today.

00:13.151 --> 00:15.918
I would really love to see you more engaged in those meetings.

00:16.061 --> 00:17.101
What do you think holds you back?

00:18.473 --> 00:23.678
I know. It's just... in production, we're very process-driven.

00:23.843 --> 00:26.889
I like to get my head around things before I say too much.

00:27.168 --> 00:27.505
Okay.

00:28.145 --> 00:29.786
And you seem so psyched about things.

00:29.884 --> 00:32.059
I didn't want to be a downer in front of the team.

00:32.572 --> 00:33.482
I totally get it.

00:33.593 --> 00:35.091
Sometimes, I'm overexcited.

00:35.567 --> 00:38.985
But the numbers show that our old approach isn't working.

00:39.155 --> 00:41.489
I'm hoping this new approach can get us back on track.

00:41.703 --> 00:43.589
I get that, we do need a new approach.

00:44.424 --> 00:45.431
So, why don't we do this:...

00:45.944 --> 00:48.567
Why don't I make sure that you have a little more of a heads-up...

00:48.650 --> 00:49.955
...before I roll out something new.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.275
That'd be awesome.

00:52.719 --> 00:55.022
And maybe you can jump in a little more...

00:55.301 --> 00:57.293
...even if you haven't quite thought it all through.

00:57.465 --> 00:58.458
Okay, I can do that.

00:59.069 --> 01:01.407
Perfect! And if you think of anything before the meeting...

01:01.494 --> 01:04.340
...you can always send it to me and I can be sure to add it to the agenda...

01:04.427 --> 01:05.730
...so we can be sure to discuss it.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.039
That'd be great.

01:07.209 --> 01:09.202
I think that works for everybody.

01:09.813 --> 01:10.333
Nice.
