00:08.585 --> 00:09.470
Nice to meet you.

00:10.452 --> 00:13.921
Sorry, I was late. I just got off the phone with an old friend at Anderson.

00:14.007 --> 00:14.755
No problem.

00:14.967 --> 00:17.413
Oh! A friend of mine is chief product officer over there.

00:17.505 --> 00:18.817
No kidding, Cindy Yang?

00:19.145 --> 00:20.706
Yes! You know Cindy?

00:20.903 --> 00:21.827
We go way back.

00:21.935 --> 00:22.905
Do you keep in touch?

00:23.448 --> 00:25.965
I actually spoke to her last year before joining the company.

00:26.187 --> 00:28.199
She was pretty excited about what we have going on.

00:28.394 --> 00:32.214
Oh really? Well, Cindy is pretty good with this kind of stuff.

00:32.529 --> 00:33.377
What impressed her?
