00:00.083 --> 00:03.812
Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations,...

00:04.307 --> 00:06.412
...we are prepared to make you a very generous offer.

00:06.510 --> 00:08.751
And we are prepared to reject that offer.

00:09.875 --> 00:10.707
Michael, you haven't even heard...

00:10.783 --> 00:12.869
Never accept their first offer.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.168
What is your second offer?

00:14.970 --> 00:16.211
Twelve thousand dollars.

00:17.388 --> 00:18.071
Are you kidding me?

00:18.407 --> 00:19.651
That is insultingly low.

00:20.277 --> 00:22.376
I don't even wanna hear what your first offer was.

00:22.512 --> 00:25.469
Here's the situation: your company is four weeks old.

00:25.570 --> 00:27.671
I know this business, I know what suppliers are charging.

00:27.899 --> 00:30.190
I know you can't be making very much money.

00:30.303 --> 00:31.785
I don't know how your prices are so low,...

00:32.273 --> 00:34.093
...but, I know it can't keep up that way.

00:34.977 --> 00:38.011
I'm sure you're scared, probably in debt.

00:38.615 --> 00:39.786
This is the best offer you're gonna get.

00:40.602 --> 00:43.110
I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation.

00:43.639 --> 00:46.623
Your company is losing clients left and right.

00:46.893 --> 00:50.825
You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you're going to have to explain to them...

00:50.967 --> 00:54.787
...why your most profitable branch is bleeding.

00:55.639 --> 00:58.435
So, they may be looking for a little change in the CFO.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.229
So, I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin.

01:00.505 --> 01:02.025
I think I just have to wait out you.

01:05.635 --> 01:07.823
Okay. Now, I don't know that I can get this.

01:07.913 --> 01:09.760
I do have to go to the board for approval.

01:12.141 --> 01:15.009
How about 60,000 dollars?

01:20.045 --> 01:20.675
Sixty thousand.

01:22.331 --> 01:22.761
Michael?

01:27.241 --> 01:30.113
We're gonna have to talk about this just amongst ourselves.

01:30.181 --> 01:31.671
Okay, done. Please, take the room.

01:32.586 --> 01:33.887
We'll be right outside.

01:34.386 --> 01:35.331
Take your time.

01:40.075 --> 01:41.710
Oh my god. Oh my god.

01:41.799 --> 01:42.565
Sixty thousand dollars?

01:42.657 --> 01:45.332
We are so rich.
