Wow this pandemic has really knocked us off our feet, hasn't it?

00:05.213 --> 00:09.941
Before the pandemic, there was talk of the car industry's demise.

00:10.287 --> 00:13.832
People were going to only be doing ride sharing and car sharing.

00:14.159 --> 00:17.979
The days of personal vehicle ownership were absolutely gone.

00:18.445 --> 00:23.132
And people were writing the epitaph on the gravestone of the car industry.

00:23.913 --> 00:27.763
I think this time frame has really shifted that somewhat.

00:28.353 --> 00:33.164
I think it's made us aware that we have to somewhat be dependent on ourselves.

00:33.597 --> 00:38.789
Although it's so fantastic to live in a society where we're sharing things.

00:38.886 --> 00:42.922
We're information sharing, we're asset sharing.

00:43.535 --> 00:46.179
There still has to be some self-reliance.

00:46.369 --> 00:51.730
And I don't know about you but I probably wouldn't get in an Uber right now.

00:51.981 --> 00:55.416
I'm sure that the Uber drivers are doing an amazing job...

00:55.504 --> 00:59.227
...and that they're all masked and that they're keeping their cars clean and safe.

00:59.343 --> 01:01.552
I am 100% sure of that.

01:02.135 --> 01:04.225
But it's a personal preference...

01:04.319 --> 01:08.759
...and right now I prefer to be in control of my own destiny in my own car...

01:09.071 --> 01:13.181
...where I know that I've sanitized it and I know that who's been in and out of it.

01:13.870 --> 01:18.495
So I still think there's absolutely going to be room for car sharing...

01:18.927 --> 01:21.808
...and for other kinds of sharing like that.

01:21.929 --> 01:25.926
But I still think it's important that we have a car of our own...

01:26.057 --> 01:29.877
...somewhere in our family so that we can control our own destiny.
