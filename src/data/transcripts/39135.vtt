00:01.863 --> 00:03.745
That was the third call you've disconnected today.

00:03.911 --> 00:06.121
Listen, Robert. I don't know what's going on with you lately,...

00:06.443 --> 00:08.009
...but if you don't start doing a better job real soon,...

00:08.085 --> 00:09.302
...we're gonna have a real problem here.

00:10.085 --> 00:12.574
I'm sorry. I know I haven't been doing my best.

00:12.865 --> 00:14.208
Well, you need to figure something out.

00:14.465 --> 00:16.011
I mean, I can't afford you making these many mistakes.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.929
I understand that and I really do want to do a better job.

00:19.486 --> 00:20.491
So, what's it gonna take?

00:21.601 --> 00:25.104
I have some personal obligations that have been pulling my attention away from my work...

00:25.264 --> 00:28.521
...and I think if I could just have a couple days to catch up,...

00:29.001 --> 00:31.179
...I could come back to work much more focused.

00:31.657 --> 00:32.785
All right, that sounds reasonable.

00:32.867 --> 00:35.418
Why don't you put in for two personal days and I'll sign off on it?

00:36.199 --> 00:37.830
That would really help. Thank you.

00:38.003 --> 00:38.959
Sure, no problem.
