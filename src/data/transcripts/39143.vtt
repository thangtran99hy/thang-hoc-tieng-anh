00:00.088 --> 00:01.059
Yes, sir. Can I help you?

00:01.161 --> 00:03.345
Hi, checking out of room 809, please.

00:03.452 --> 00:05.823
Yes, sir. Was everything satisfactory, sir?

00:06.037 --> 00:07.701
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.

00:07.773 --> 00:10.835
I'm running late for a flight, so if we could speed this up...

00:11.490 --> 00:12.533
I just need to review your account...

00:12.603 --> 00:15.051
...and have you sign the room rate and the incidentals, sir.

00:15.263 --> 00:15.525
Fine.

00:16.219 --> 00:19.373
One night at a standard rate: 119 dollars.

00:19.573 --> 00:19.893
Okay, yes.

00:20.147 --> 00:22.953
State tax comes to 9 dollars and 52 cents.

00:23.039 --> 00:23.353
Okay.

00:23.681 --> 00:25.538
Facility fee: 15 dollars.

00:25.625 --> 00:27.086
It's fine, I don't care.

00:27.201 --> 00:28.330
I just need to get to the airport.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.388
So, you can just put it on the credit card that you have on file.

00:30.493 --> 00:31.965
We don't want to overcharge you, sir.

00:32.070 --> 00:35.369
Three-minute phone calls: 4 dollars and 22 cents.

00:35.444 --> 00:36.408
Okay, that's right.

00:36.655 --> 00:39.123
One dinner buffet billed to the room: 15 dollars.

00:39.217 --> 00:39.467
Sure.

00:39.775 --> 00:42.613
One glass of red wine with the buffet: 9 dollars.

00:42.687 --> 00:45.857
Okay, this all sounds fine. Look, I really have to go, I have a cab waiting.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.687
Your receipt is printing.

00:47.766 --> 00:49.302
Okay, I don't need a receipt.

00:49.369 --> 00:50.772
It's nearly printed.

00:56.202 --> 00:57.627
And it's jammed, sir.

00:58.233 --> 00:59.171
I'll print you another.

00:59.326 --> 01:00.664
That's okay, don't worry about it.

01:00.779 --> 01:02.979
And look at that! I missed my flight!

01:03.789 --> 01:05.385
Will you be needing lodging tonight, sir?

01:05.481 --> 01:06.135
Yes, please.

01:06.215 --> 01:08.070
All right, let's go through that one more time.
