Rolls-Royce is to go all-electric by 2030.

00:04.647 --> 00:05.779
The news came Wednesday...

00:05.867 --> 00:11.079
...as the luxury carmaker revealed some first glimpses of its debut EV.

00:11.607 --> 00:17.223
The Spectre will go on sale in late 2023 with testing set to begin soon.

00:17.940 --> 00:20.155
Company boss Torsten Muller-Otvos says...

00:20.261 --> 00:23.609
...the brand will then progressively ditch combustion engines.

00:24.227 --> 00:28.821
Current cars from Rolls-Royce are anything but zero-emission vehicles.

00:29.468 --> 00:33.535
Now, though, it follows rival Bentley in making the switch to electric...

00:34.095 --> 00:40.825
...and it's ahead of parent firm BMW, which has set no end date for gasoline-fueled motors.

00:41.225 --> 00:46.151
Back in 1900s, the company, says founder Charles Rolls, described electric cars...

00:46.269 --> 00:50.613
...as perfectly noiseless and clean and very useful...

00:50.897 --> 00:53.789
...if only charging stations were available.

00:54.311 --> 00:58.534
More than a century later, that moment may finally have come.
