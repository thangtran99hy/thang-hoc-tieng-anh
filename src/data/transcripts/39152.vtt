00:00.050 --> 00:01.131
I can't find the McGinnis file.

00:01.201 --> 00:02.179
I keep losing it.

00:02.439 --> 00:03.955
I mean, I don't know, is it me?

00:04.643 --> 00:06.049
No. I don't know. Hold on.

00:06.973 --> 00:08.820
Don't be silly.

00:11.942 --> 00:12.841
Oh, that's weird.

00:13.569 --> 00:15.301
Right? It just keeps disappearing.

00:17.140 --> 00:18.197
Okay, hold on.

00:18.282 --> 00:19.036
We're gonna find it.

00:19.139 --> 00:20.186
Just give me one second.

00:25.559 --> 00:29.081
I'm starving, I haven't eaten since lunch.

00:33.075 --> 00:33.954
Ah, here it is.

00:34.450 --> 00:34.904
Where?

00:36.074 --> 00:38.291
I'm just gonna drag it to your desktop for now.

00:38.976 --> 00:40.366
It was in the damages file.

00:40.611 --> 00:43.158
It didn't have its own file like the rest of the families in a lawsuit.

00:44.355 --> 00:46.601
But, I'm just gonna organize this tomorrow.

00:47.199 --> 00:48.969
Thank you. That would be great.

00:49.073 --> 00:49.577
Yeah.
