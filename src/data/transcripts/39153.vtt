00:01.683 --> 00:06.191
In Japan, Fumio Kishida has formally taken over as prime minister.

00:06.625 --> 00:11.751
The 64-year-old easily won Monday's parliamentary vote to become the country's new leader.

00:12.320 --> 00:17.654
He succeeds Yoshihide Suga, who stepped down after only one year in office.

00:20.441 --> 00:26.438
Kishida is expected to dissolve parliament and call a snap election for November later this week.

00:26.775 --> 00:31.965
Observers see the early date as a move to take advantage of his fresh image.

00:34.084 --> 00:39.715
Kishida will face several tough issues including Japan's post-pandemic economic recovery...

00:39.841 --> 00:42.809
...and a nuclear-armed North Korea.

00:43.214 --> 00:47.969
A former foreign minister, Kishida was regarded until recently as a moderate liberal,...

00:48.267 --> 00:52.903
...but has apparently shifted to the right in a bid to win over influential conservatives...

00:53.196 --> 00:55.315
...in his Liberal Democratic Party.
