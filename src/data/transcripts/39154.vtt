00:00.050 --> 00:02.240
For so many of us, myself included,...

00:02.657 --> 00:05.827
...our days feel filled with a million small interruptions.

00:06.279 --> 00:08.520
And this is true even of our days off.

00:08.854 --> 00:11.263
Maybe you've taken a call at the beach,...

00:11.643 --> 00:13.728
...texted your boss from the grocery store...

00:13.829 --> 00:16.689
...or emailed a colleague while on a picnic with your family.

00:17.139 --> 00:20.618
We've convinced ourselves that these behaviors are no big deal.

00:20.848 --> 00:22.451
It's just one email.

00:23.249 --> 00:25.800
But there's a real cost to these interruptions,...

00:26.023 --> 00:30.626
...and there are smart strategies we can all take to better protect our time.

00:34.976 --> 00:37.558
These moments seem so small at the time,...

00:37.749 --> 00:41.569
...and yet, research suggests they add up to a tremendous loss.

00:41.855 --> 00:46.233
The constant creep of work into our personal lives can increase our stress...

00:46.325 --> 00:48.133
...and undermine our happiness.

00:48.527 --> 00:50.273
So just what is the cost?

00:50.375 --> 00:52.791
In one study, researchers recruited parents...

00:52.864 --> 00:55.415
...who were visiting a science museum with their kids.

00:55.917 --> 00:58.852
Some parents were told to check their phone as much as possible.

00:58.951 --> 01:01.780
Others were told to check their phone as little as possible.

01:02.150 --> 01:04.603
After the visit, parents who used their phones reported...

01:04.677 --> 01:07.293
...that the experience was significantly less meaningful.

01:07.610 --> 01:09.455
They also felt much lonelier.

01:09.738 --> 01:12.707
In another study, tourists who were asked to have their phones out...

01:12.813 --> 01:17.035
...while visiting an iconic church remembered fewer details a week later.

01:17.200 --> 01:20.323
And in my research, employees who were paid for their performance...

01:20.419 --> 01:23.821
...spent increasingly less time interacting with friends and family,...

01:24.095 --> 01:28.193
...and more and more time interacting with colleagues and clients.
