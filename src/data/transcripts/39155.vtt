00:00.050 --> 00:05.532
Despite knowing better, I, too, have found myself focusing on "urgent work distractions"...

00:05.635 --> 00:07.752
...over important life moments.

00:07.860 --> 00:10.657
Most recently, I found myself texting a client...

00:10.790 --> 00:14.610
...while in the middle of my first child's first ultrasound.

00:15.343 --> 00:17.677
Happy client, guilty mom-to-be.

00:17.997 --> 00:19.947
When you add up all of these moments,...

00:20.212 --> 00:26.447
...the sum total is a life shortchanged on meaning, joy, connection and even memory.

00:26.696 --> 00:30.015
As we remake our models of work in the wake of the pandemic,...

00:30.156 --> 00:34.707
...now is our opportunity to create a new culture that respects time,...

00:34.839 --> 00:36.662
...and the way to make this really big change...

00:36.745 --> 00:39.691
...is through small steps that we can take right now.

00:39.921 --> 00:43.773
The first step that we need to take is to reframe rest.

00:44.369 --> 00:47.725
Reflect for a moment about what you think about when you hear the word "rest."

00:48.486 --> 00:49.677
Sounds amazing, right?

00:50.164 --> 00:51.541
But in my mind,...

00:51.628 --> 00:56.253
...I immediately worry about not being productive enough or letting down my colleagues.

00:56.681 --> 00:58.514
When we do have time off,...

00:58.685 --> 01:02.103
...we need to find ways in which we can enjoy the present moment...

01:02.251 --> 01:04.938
...and savor the leisure time that we have available,...

01:05.021 --> 01:08.379
...as opposed to seeing it as an unproductive barrier to our work.

01:08.811 --> 01:13.725
One specific strategy we can take is to treat our upcoming weekend like a vacation.

01:13.880 --> 01:18.389
On Friday afternoon, jot down how you would act and behave as if you were on a holiday.
