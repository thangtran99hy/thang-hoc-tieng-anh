00:00.050 --> 00:05.049
Another strategy you can take is to create clear boundaries for your time off.

00:05.259 --> 00:09.699
Instead of saying, "I'm out of the office. Feel free to Slack me whenever."

00:09.927 --> 00:13.345
Say, "I'll be offline. Call me only if it's urgent."

00:14.220 --> 00:17.483
To uphold these personal goals, work together as a team.

00:17.763 --> 00:20.469
Set team goals for personal time.

00:20.610 --> 00:24.307
Do it publicly, collect data and hold each other accountable.

00:24.839 --> 00:28.968
These goals could sound like, "I will not check email between 6:00 and 8:00 p.m."

00:29.323 --> 00:31.681
"I will have dinner with my family four nights a week"...

00:31.777 --> 00:33.743
...or "I will go for a jog midday."

00:34.033 --> 00:36.893
Check in on your team's progress and see how everyone's doing.

00:37.256 --> 00:40.052
If you or your teammates are unsuccessful,...

00:40.163 --> 00:42.686
...work together to help accomplish personal goals.

00:42.933 --> 00:45.174
Lastly, you can negotiate for more time...

00:45.329 --> 00:48.065
...to prevent work from creeping in to your personal life.

00:48.493 --> 00:51.601
In business school, I teach students to negotiate for salary,...

00:51.989 --> 00:55.778
...but realize I spoke almost nothing about negotiating for more time.

00:56.543 --> 00:58.320
What does this look like in practice?

00:58.517 --> 01:01.494
You can ask for more time on adjustable deadlines at work.

01:01.749 --> 01:04.330
If your client asks for a deliverable Monday morning,...

01:04.635 --> 01:07.402
...ask for an extension until Tuesday afternoon...

01:07.559 --> 01:10.511
...so you don't find yourself working on your well-deserved weekend.

01:11.317 --> 01:14.084
And don't worry too much about reputation.

01:14.434 --> 01:17.357
Quality truly is the metric that matters most.

01:17.743 --> 01:21.068
In my data, employees who proactively asked for more time...

01:21.363 --> 01:23.665
...reported lower levels of stress and burnout...

01:23.849 --> 01:27.304
...and were seen as more committed and professional by their colleagues.
