We used to be able to get into a room with the enemy,...

00:04.679 --> 00:06.677
...and now they're just floating in the ether.

00:08.225 --> 00:11.236
When our secret finds its way out, it'll be the death of you.

00:12.487 --> 00:15.050
Oh my god, target enough people.

00:17.463 --> 00:19.263
And the people become the weapon.

00:24.877 --> 00:27.429
I could be speaking to my own reflection.

00:29.271 --> 00:31.115
Only your skills die with your body.

00:32.474 --> 00:35.725
And life is all about leaving something behind.

00:37.037 --> 00:37.836
Isn't it?
