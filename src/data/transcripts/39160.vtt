Today, I'm going to show you a simple science experiment...

00:03.523 --> 00:05.920
...that you can try at home to learn about density.

00:06.339 --> 00:10.485
Start by taking an empty glass and tip in some water and food coloring.

00:11.631 --> 00:13.641
Then add some syrup or treacle.

00:16.099 --> 00:19.577
And I'm going to add a little bit more water to make the layer a bit thicker.

00:20.297 --> 00:22.785
Then finally, fill the glass up with some oil...

00:23.446 --> 00:25.896
...and leave it to settle for about 15 minutes.

00:26.319 --> 00:28.690
These liquids separate out into different layers...

00:28.909 --> 00:31.443
...because they're different densities and they don't mix.

00:31.685 --> 00:34.835
The syrup has the highest density, so it sits on the bottom...

00:34.969 --> 00:38.227
...and the oil, which has the lowest density, rises to the top.

00:38.717 --> 00:42.027
Try dropping different objects in to see what happens.

00:42.172 --> 00:44.896
If we drop this metal nut in, which is really dense,...

00:44.985 --> 00:46.951
...you can see it sinks right to the bottom.

00:48.101 --> 00:49.938
But if I take this grape and drop it in,...

00:50.136 --> 00:53.066
...it sinks through the oil in water, but sits on the syrup.

00:53.341 --> 00:55.857
This is because the syrup is denser than the grape.

00:56.233 --> 00:57.160
Pretty cool, huh!

00:57.711 --> 01:00.172
Now, if I take this plastic bottle top and drop it in,...

01:00.373 --> 01:03.315
...it slowly sinks through the oil and sits on the water.

01:03.617 --> 01:07.744
And finally, if I take this piece of sponge and drop it in, it sits on top.

01:07.951 --> 01:09.701
The oil is denser than the sponge.

01:09.977 --> 01:13.797
You can try dropping different objects in to see which fluids are denser.

01:13.966 --> 01:18.343
I also found shining a torch beam down from above gives a really nice effect.
