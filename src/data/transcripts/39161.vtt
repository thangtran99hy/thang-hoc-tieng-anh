Whether you're working from home, remotely or even on the road,...

00:06.351 --> 00:09.309
...the way we live and work is always changing.

00:10.170 --> 00:14.063
Working in a changing environment can create worry and feelings of stress,...

00:14.213 --> 00:18.559
...uncertainty and loneliness, which can have a negative effect on our mental health.

00:19.178 --> 00:22.523
However, there are things you can do to help you stay mentally healthy...

00:22.629 --> 00:24.955
...in your workplace no matter where that is.

00:28.157 --> 00:32.720
Keep to a routine with clear start and finish times in a designated workspace.

00:36.314 --> 00:40.629
Be sure to take regular breaks, get physical exercise and switch off after work.

00:43.919 --> 00:48.611
If you're able to, participate in opportunities that let you reconnect with co-workers.

00:49.041 --> 00:51.435
Schedule regular catch-ups and chats with your colleagues...

00:51.811 --> 00:55.755
...either online or over the phone to maintain connections and stay in touch.

01:01.821 --> 01:04.991
Always be on the lookout for signs that someone is struggling.

01:05.515 --> 01:08.034
Look for changes in communication and behaviour.

01:08.627 --> 01:09.671
Are they posting less?

01:10.410 --> 01:11.723
Are they answering your calls?

01:12.471 --> 01:14.782
Is there a change in their tone or language?

01:15.456 --> 01:17.838
And then, trust your gut and check in with them.

01:19.448 --> 01:21.394
It's okay to say you're not okay.

01:22.884 --> 01:26.735
Many organisations offer free mental health support services...

01:26.977 --> 01:30.364
...or your workplace may have an employee assistance program available.

01:30.850 --> 01:35.444
If you start to feel overwhelmed or anxious, seek support immediately.

01:37.131 --> 01:41.198
