Business letters are a great way to present your message in a classic, polished style.

00:05.286 --> 00:07.618
In addition to being formal and structured,...

00:08.021 --> 00:10.046
...business letters are also quite versatile...

00:10.419 --> 00:15.880
...as they can be used for official requests, announcements, cover letters and more.

00:17.227 --> 00:19.437
While there are different ways to format your letter,...

00:19.839 --> 00:21.956
...block format is one of the most common.

00:22.867 --> 00:26.916
Block format keeps the text at left justified and single-spaced...

00:27.121 --> 00:30.507
...with double spaces between paragraphs and different sections.

00:31.196 --> 00:33.896
This layout keeps the letter simple and legible.

00:35.639 --> 00:37.903
The first section of a letter is the opening.

00:38.522 --> 00:41.351
As you start your letter, include your mailing address,...

00:41.833 --> 00:46.489
...the full date and the recipient's name, company and address.

00:47.897 --> 00:50.455
When you greet the recipient in the salutation,...

00:50.889 --> 00:53.997
...use "Dear" along with their title and last name.

00:54.882 --> 00:59.043
If you don't know the recipient's title, use their full name instead.

00:59.720 --> 01:02.766
Also, add a colon to the end of your greeting.

01:04.771 --> 01:09.395
In the first paragraph of the body, introduce yourself and your main point.

01:10.247 --> 01:13.847
Following paragraphs should go into the details of your main point,...

01:14.242 --> 01:17.536
...while the final paragraph should restate the letter's purpose...

01:17.729 --> 01:20.261
...and provide a call to action if necessary.

01:21.723 --> 01:24.273
For formal closing, use "Sincerely"...

01:24.693 --> 01:29.132
...or for something more personal try using "Cordially" or "Best regards".

01:29.703 --> 01:32.822
Whatever you choose, end your closing with a comma.

01:34.379 --> 01:38.084
For the signature, skip four lines after your closing...

01:38.207 --> 01:41.996
...and type your name, job title and company name.

01:42.597 --> 01:44.240
If you're submitting a hard copy,...

01:44.647 --> 01:47.849
...sign your name in the empty space using blue or black ink.

01:48.985 --> 01:51.783
And if you're enclosing any documents or items,...

01:52.131 --> 01:55.456
...skip four lines after the signature and list them here.
