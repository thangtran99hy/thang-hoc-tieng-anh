Take a look at these two photographs.

00:06.838 --> 00:10.565
One of them shows a genuine smile, the other shows a fake smile.

00:10.842 --> 00:12.959
See if you can spot the fake smile.

00:13.509 --> 00:16.655
Give yourself one point if you chose this photograph.

00:18.221 --> 00:20.401
Now try again with these photographs.

00:22.207 --> 00:23.568
Here's the correct answer.

00:24.024 --> 00:27.287
And finally try to spot the fake smile here.

00:29.787 --> 00:31.366
If you scored three out of three,...

00:31.553 --> 00:34.219
...then you're good at reading other people's expressions.

00:34.825 --> 00:36.553
Two out of three, and you're okay.

00:37.193 --> 00:39.046
And if you scored one or zero,...

00:39.250 --> 00:42.482
...then you might want to know the secret to spotting a fake smile.

00:42.777 --> 00:47.619
During a genuine smile, tiny crinkles appear around the sides of the eyes.

00:47.735 --> 00:50.359
During a fake smile, these crinkles are missing.

00:50.465 --> 00:53.852
So next time you want to know if someone's really happy to see you,...

00:53.991 --> 00:56.341
...simply look at the sides of their eyes.
