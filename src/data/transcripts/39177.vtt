00:01.239 --> 00:03.284
In the desert of southern Israel,...

00:03.375 --> 00:09.946
...a team of six scientists have begun simulating what it might be like to live on Mars.

00:10.340 --> 00:14.078
The red-hued Ramon Crater will be home for about a month...

00:14.199 --> 00:17.573
...to the five men and one woman participating in the mission.

00:17.909 --> 00:22.070
Their AMADEE-20 habitat is tucked beneath a rocky steppe.

00:22.421 --> 00:25.745
Inside, they sleep, eat and conduct experiments.

00:26.166 --> 00:30.238
Outside, they wear mock spacesuits fitted with cameras, microphones...

00:30.319 --> 00:32.476
...and self-contained breathing systems.

00:33.019 --> 00:37.797
Outside, other engineers and specialists will work with a drone and rover...

00:37.891 --> 00:43.631
...to improve autonomous navigation and mapping on a world where GPS is not available.

00:44.051 --> 00:47.408
Altogether, they will carry out more than 20 experiments...

00:47.503 --> 00:50.827
...in fields including geology, biology and medicine...

00:51.235 --> 00:54.033
...and hope to publish some of the results when finished.
