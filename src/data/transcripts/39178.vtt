Digital Theatre is a company that offers educational material...

00:04.075 --> 00:07.497
...for schools, for universities, for libraries.

00:07.619 --> 00:13.049
We're providing a product that helps young people get access to theater...

00:13.325 --> 00:15.279
...that otherwise they just really wouldn't have.

00:15.349 --> 00:19.541
There's a whole broad aspect here of preparing students to go into the real world.

00:19.716 --> 00:21.001
We'll call into Australia.

00:21.410 --> 00:25.818
We will have seminars and webinars with school groups in the US.

00:26.183 --> 00:28.841
We sell into schools all around the world.

00:29.078 --> 00:32.991
What makes Digital Theatre so unique: other people, without question.

00:33.327 --> 00:36.215
Teamwork is not necessarily people working together.

00:36.301 --> 00:37.846
It's working with people you trust.

00:38.256 --> 00:41.205
And that's how it feels like at Digital Theater.
