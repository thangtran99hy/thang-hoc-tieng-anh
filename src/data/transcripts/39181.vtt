00:00.245 --> 00:01.891
So, I see we have a problem here.

00:02.461 --> 00:03.155
We need to solve it.

00:03.245 --> 00:03.911
What's going on?

00:04.235 --> 00:06.630
I'm trying to explain to your man here...

00:06.844 --> 00:09.797
...that his procedures won't work with my production schedule.

00:10.184 --> 00:12.314
And I'm not gonna throw my department into chaos...

00:12.379 --> 00:15.201
...just so that he can check off all his little boxes.

00:15.365 --> 00:19.168
And I'm trying to get this man to understand that we have procedures for a reason.

00:19.259 --> 00:22.683
And now that he's part of our company, he doesn't get to be a free agent anymore.

00:22.762 --> 00:26.447
And I'm trying to get him to understand that the whole point of your acquiring us...

00:26.714 --> 00:30.421
...was to benefit from our experience and expertise.

00:30.634 --> 00:32.304
Okay. So, let me get this straight.

00:32.649 --> 00:35.665
Cliff, you're concerned that following the procedures is throwing off...

00:35.737 --> 00:37.871
...and slowing down your production schedule.

00:38.529 --> 00:40.572
And when Cliff doesn't follow the procedures...

00:40.649 --> 00:44.190
...it creates problems for your reporting and compromises accuracy?

00:44.941 --> 00:45.751
Does that sum it up?

00:46.286 --> 00:46.773
Pretty much.

00:46.879 --> 00:47.687
That's the thumbnail, yeah.

00:48.637 --> 00:52.324
Good. Now we know the problem, we can figure out how to solve it.
