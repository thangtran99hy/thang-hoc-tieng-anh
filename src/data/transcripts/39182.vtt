00:00.409 --> 00:03.710
So, here I am, applying to be one of your interns...

00:03.885 --> 00:07.425
...because the more I think about this idea, the more tremendous I think it is.

00:07.621 --> 00:10.061
I love the idea of having a place I can go every day.

00:10.336 --> 00:13.468
I want the connection,  the excitement, I want to be challenged...

00:13.541 --> 00:15.717
...and I guess I might even want to be needed.

00:16.273 --> 00:18.318
The tech stuff might take a bit to figure out.

00:18.394 --> 00:22.411
I had to call my nine-year-old grandson just to find out what a USB connector was.

00:23.119 --> 00:24.491
But, I'll get there, eager to learn.

00:24.818 --> 00:27.556
Also, I want you to know, I've been a company man all my life.

00:28.127 --> 00:30.888
I'm loyal, I'm trustworthy and I'm good in a crisis.

00:31.181 --> 00:32.674
And I love that you're right here in Brooklyn.

00:32.979 --> 00:36.463
I've lived here all my life, and lately, I feel I may not be hip enough to live in Brooklyn.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.076
So, this could help with that, too.

00:39.082 --> 00:41.109
I read once, "Musicians don't retire."

00:41.501 --> 00:43.247
"They stop when there's no more music in them."

00:43.551 --> 00:45.057
Well, I still have music in me.

00:45.194 --> 00:47.063
Absolutely positive about that.
