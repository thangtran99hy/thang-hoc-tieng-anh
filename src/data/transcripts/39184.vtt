These are the networking tips that I used to get my job at MALK.

00:05.201 --> 00:09.516
Even though I didn't have as much experience in marketing as maybe somebody else,...

00:09.868 --> 00:13.186
...I did use my network in order for me to get my foot in the door...

00:13.299 --> 00:14.283
...and land me the job.

00:14.429 --> 00:18.217
I was fortunate enough to have a friend who owns a lot of coffee shops...

00:18.319 --> 00:20.179
...who happens to use MALK, the almond milk,...

00:20.277 --> 00:22.735
...and he made the introduction between me and the CEO.

00:22.959 --> 00:26.649
Whenever you're networking, you must always remember that you are planting seeds.

00:26.728 --> 00:29.719
That one coffee or hello that you had one year...

00:29.809 --> 00:33.505
...might lead you to the promotion that you want five years later at another company.

00:33.827 --> 00:36.955
So, when I'm networking, I'm always looking for a face-to-face opportunity...

00:37.105 --> 00:39.661
...just putting myself in front of that person,...

00:39.743 --> 00:42.511
...shaking their hand and then offering to take him out to coffee.

00:42.843 --> 00:46.161
Do the research on the brand and then get to know the person first.

00:46.263 --> 00:48.552
It's just respecting their time...

00:48.637 --> 00:53.211
...and getting them relaxed and comfortable with wanting to help you.

00:53.427 --> 00:55.137
You want someone to champion for you.

00:55.341 --> 00:58.545
Close it out with saying "If you want to keep in touch, here's my business card."

00:59.013 --> 01:02.245
So, that's how I got my job, and I hope it helps you get yours.
