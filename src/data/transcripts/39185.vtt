Hi! I'm Alison and this is what I wore to get my job at Rent the Runway.

00:07.801 --> 00:10.449
When I was getting ready for my Rent the Runway interview,...

00:10.538 --> 00:14.197
...I went on social media for Rent the Runway to see what other people were wearing,...

00:14.309 --> 00:15.099
...and that really helped me.

00:15.379 --> 00:17.953
I just picked something out of my closet that was really bright,...

00:18.071 --> 00:20.405
...thinking maybe that would help them remember me,...

00:20.529 --> 00:22.762
...and it was something I felt really comfortable in, too.

00:23.065 --> 00:26.417
And one thing I remember is that I chose to wear my nose ring,...

00:26.515 --> 00:28.884
...which is something I would normally take out for an interview,...

00:29.275 --> 00:31.938
...but I was thinking to myself, these people just need to accept me,...

00:32.030 --> 00:34.049
...and if they do, then I know it's the right fit.

00:35.060 --> 00:39.027
If I were to tell someone how to prepare and be dressed for an interview,...

00:39.154 --> 00:43.318
...I would really say to pick something that really exemplifies who you are,...

00:43.410 --> 00:44.932
...and that you feel really confident in.

00:45.403 --> 00:47.681
The one thing I consciously avoided...

00:47.812 --> 00:51.765
...was actually my classic interview outfit that I've had for many years,...

00:51.853 --> 00:53.489
...which is this navy blue suit,...

00:53.894 --> 00:57.719
...and I was determined to wear anything other than that suit, basically.

00:58.752 --> 01:03.099
So, I got dressed the way that I felt was right and that's how I got my job.
