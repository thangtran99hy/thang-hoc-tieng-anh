This is how I prepped for my video interview to get my job.

00:04.693 --> 00:06.519
I work for a company called Yoga Club,...

00:06.600 --> 00:09.243
...and it's a subscription box for women's activewear.

00:09.532 --> 00:13.352
So, I took the time to sign up for the box, and become a customer myself.

00:13.505 --> 00:16.708
Really get a feel for what that customer experience was like,...

00:16.789 --> 00:18.751
...so that I could speak to it in the interview.

00:18.887 --> 00:21.795
In today's world, the video interview is way more common.

00:21.882 --> 00:24.674
You definitely want to test out your computer.

00:24.747 --> 00:27.705
I recommend doing a quick trial run prior to the interview...

00:27.785 --> 00:29.606
...to make sure that the sound is good.

00:29.986 --> 00:34.673
You have to make eye contact and really showcase who you are and your personality.

00:34.987 --> 00:37.539
It's a little challenging doing that, talking into a camera,...

00:37.629 --> 00:39.901
...but I think that ultimately helps you stand out.
