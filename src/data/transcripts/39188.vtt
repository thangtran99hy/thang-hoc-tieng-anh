This is how I prepared for my interview to get my job at Squarespace.

00:05.617 --> 00:10.149
What better way to apply for a job at a website company than to make an actual website?

00:10.896 --> 00:13.570
So, I made a one-page website about myself.

00:14.034 --> 00:16.983
Once I got the hang of it, I could speak to the product in the interview,...

00:17.116 --> 00:19.983
...and actually show them a bit about me, my personality,...

00:20.076 --> 00:22.057
...and my work experience with a website.

00:22.707 --> 00:24.721
So, of course, I researched the company itself,...

00:24.827 --> 00:26.644
...I researched the folks that I'd be interviewing with.

00:26.735 --> 00:30.369
I had a friend actually guide me through a fake interview...

00:30.765 --> 00:33.785
...where we just pulled questions from the internet that we thought might come up,...

00:33.877 --> 00:36.061
...which kind of helped me get the scaries out.

00:36.272 --> 00:39.767
Before I went into the interview, I did a boxer move,...

00:39.893 --> 00:43.050
...listened to really energetic music and psyched myself up.

00:43.269 --> 00:45.461
Self affirmations like "You got this!"

00:45.553 --> 00:47.895
...so that I could really walk in feeling energized.

00:48.099 --> 00:49.589
One thing that I took into consideration...

00:49.665 --> 00:53.718
...is just sort of how I present myself, my posture and my confidence.

00:53.833 --> 00:57.222
I wanted to make sure I wasn't slouching and being too casual,...

00:57.303 --> 01:00.400
...although the hiring manager did tell me it was a very casual environment.

01:00.465 --> 01:02.253
I wanted to make sure that I demonstrated to him...

01:02.341 --> 01:05.617
...that I was confident and poised and ready for the role.
