Dad, how do you get a job?

00:01.914 --> 00:04.365
Well, first, you search for one, that's terrible.

00:04.943 --> 00:06.446
Send off your resume and wait.

00:06.699 --> 00:09.573
Then if you're lucky, you work a job you hate until you die.

00:11.171 --> 00:11.729
Night, buddy.

00:13.059 --> 00:15.157
Daddy, what's it like to work?

00:15.464 --> 00:18.101
Well, first you get a job and it's exciting.

00:18.641 --> 00:20.754
Then that wears off, so eventually, you quit.

00:21.308 --> 00:23.301
Then you think, "I'll just search for a new job..."

00:23.595 --> 00:24.397
...that's terrible.
