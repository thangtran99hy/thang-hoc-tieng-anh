00:00.215 --> 00:02.673
There are two things that I think that great leaders need to have:...

00:03.439 --> 00:04.605
...empathy and perspective.

00:05.111 --> 00:07.086
And I think these things are very often forgotten.

00:07.556 --> 00:11.700
Leaders are so often so concerned about their status or their position in the organization...

00:11.782 --> 00:13.606
...that they actually forget their real job.

00:14.279 --> 00:17.551
And the real job of a leader is not about being in charge.

00:17.893 --> 00:20.937
It's about taking care of those in our charge.

00:21.391 --> 00:23.067
And I don't think people realize this.

00:23.230 --> 00:24.581
And I don't think people train for this.

00:25.373 --> 00:26.556
Leadership is the same.

00:27.119 --> 00:29.814
We all have the capacity to be a leader.

00:30.086 --> 00:31.918
It doesn't mean everybody should be a leader...

00:32.100 --> 00:33.989
...and it doesn't mean everybody wants to be a leader,...

00:34.499 --> 00:39.439
...and the reason is because it comes at great personal sacrifice.

00:40.003 --> 00:42.109
Remember, you're not in charge.

00:42.261 --> 00:44.954
You're responsible for those in your charge.

00:45.469 --> 00:48.911
That means things like when everything goes right, you have to give away all the credit,...

00:49.361 --> 00:52.613
...and when everything goes wrong, you have to take all the responsibility.
