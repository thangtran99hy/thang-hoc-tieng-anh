One of my jobs as the leader of Amazon is to encourage people to be bold.

00:06.902 --> 00:10.350
And people love to focus on things that aren't yet working.

00:11.245 --> 00:12.841
And that's good, it's human nature.

00:12.950 --> 00:15.305
That kind of divine discontent can be very helpful,...

00:15.764 --> 00:21.283
...but it's incredibly hard to get people to take bold bets.

00:21.563 --> 00:22.873
You need to encourage that.

00:22.950 --> 00:26.366
And if you're gonna take bold bets, they're gonna be experiments.

00:26.441 --> 00:29.682
And if they're experiments, you don't know ahead of time if they're gonna work.

00:30.047 --> 00:34.411
Experiments are by their very nature prone to failure,...

00:34.506 --> 00:41.201
...but a few big successes compensate for dozens and dozens of things that didn't work.
