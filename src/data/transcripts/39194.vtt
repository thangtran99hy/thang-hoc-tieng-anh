If you're a young person, and you are not so sure what is the perfect career for you,...

00:05.345 --> 00:07.927
...it means that you have not tried enough things.

00:08.232 --> 00:09.353
Because it's like sports,...

00:09.608 --> 00:14.171
...how do you know what sports you would excel in, if you haven't played enough?

00:14.328 --> 00:17.559
So, let's say you've only played basketball your whole life.

00:17.825 --> 00:20.377
You're like, you know what? Maybe I'm a pretty good basketball player,...

00:20.773 --> 00:23.276
...but maybe you're only five foot five.

00:23.772 --> 00:27.006
And you thought, "You know what? This is what I like to do, maybe this is my career."

00:27.159 --> 00:29.004
Well, maybe you haven't tried other things.

00:29.206 --> 00:30.389
Have you tried swimming?

00:30.732 --> 00:32.350
Have you tried football?

00:32.442 --> 00:33.566
Have you tried soccer?

00:33.809 --> 00:34.887
Have you tried ping-pong?

00:34.958 --> 00:36.981
Have you tried other sports?

00:37.189 --> 00:41.569
When you try enough things, it is an elimination process.

00:41.959 --> 00:45.470
Very quickly you would know, you know what, that's not my thing.
