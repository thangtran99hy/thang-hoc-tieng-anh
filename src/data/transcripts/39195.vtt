A little girl went to a pet shop and asked,

00:03.865 --> 00:07.653
"Excuse me, excuse me, do you have any rabbits?"

00:08.379 --> 00:09.350
"Well yes, we do."

00:09.481 --> 00:12.337
"If you go down this aisle we have black rabbits."

00:12.437 --> 00:15.359
"And if you go down this aisle we have white rabbits."

00:15.659 --> 00:18.287
"And if you go down this aisle we have brown rabbits."

00:18.621 --> 00:20.132
"What kind of rabbit would you like?"

00:21.450 --> 00:24.652
"Well, I don't think my pet snake really cares."
