Let's say you're speaking to a room full of people who want to start their own companies.

00:04.608 --> 00:05.666
You say to them these:

00:06.119 --> 00:07.521
"I've met a lot of startup CEOs,...

00:07.635 --> 00:10.968
...these are the three biggest mistakes that you shouldn't make that I've seen a lot."

00:11.087 --> 00:12.174
What are those three mistakes?

00:12.513 --> 00:18.055
So, it would start with focus and being able to very clearly articulate...

00:18.148 --> 00:21.208
...what it is that the company is ultimately trying to accomplish.

00:21.289 --> 00:23.257
What is the mission of the organization?

00:23.379 --> 00:27.831
And for that mission to be as singular and unique to that company as it can be.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.501
And to focus on fewer things.

00:31.015 --> 00:33.795
And with fewer things, you'll be able to do them better.

00:34.705 --> 00:36.181
It's easier to communicate.

00:36.267 --> 00:37.477
It's easier to internalize.

00:37.556 --> 00:39.036
It's easier to execute upon.

00:39.217 --> 00:41.454
And as companies scale, they end up doing more things.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.906
That's the nature of it.
