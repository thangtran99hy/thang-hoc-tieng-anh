Bonjour and welcome to Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo,...

00:03.840 --> 00:06.164
...a country number 188.

00:12.586 --> 00:15.529
There are many unique things about Brazzaville that I can tell you about...

00:15.680 --> 00:18.517
...such as the green taxis or the impressive bridges,...

00:18.659 --> 00:21.912
...but nothing to me is more special than the sapeurs.

00:33.331 --> 00:35.492
Also known as the Brazzaville dandies,...

00:35.598 --> 00:37.349
...the sapeurs are Congolese men...

00:37.457 --> 00:42.044
...who like to dress themselves in swanky suits, ties and colorful attire.

00:42.282 --> 00:45.545
Why? Nothing more than to gain attention.

00:57.211 --> 01:00.545
The sapeurs pride themselves in dressing uniquely from one another,...

01:00.633 --> 01:03.184
...never wearing the same outfit each day.

01:03.321 --> 01:05.613
They have their own bro code and way of interacting...

01:05.884 --> 01:09.319
...like when greeting each other, they rub the front of their heads together.

01:09.626 --> 01:11.066
It's almost like a cult.

01:11.215 --> 01:13.869
But perhaps the most interesting thing about the sapeurs...

01:13.987 --> 01:16.658
...is that they often come from the slums of Brazzaville...

01:16.792 --> 01:19.149
...but nonetheless managed to get their hands on...

01:19.230 --> 01:21.741
...the most fine tailored suits and accessories.
