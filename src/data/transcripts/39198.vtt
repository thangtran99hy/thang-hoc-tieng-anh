Alice works at a local department store.

00:03.539 --> 00:06.740
She spends most of her day interacting with customers and co-workers.

00:07.320 --> 00:08.541
There's a lot of talking involved,...

00:08.691 --> 00:11.551
...but there's also another form of nonverbal communication...

00:11.707 --> 00:15.315
...that's being used just as often: body language.

00:16.140 --> 00:19.836
Body language is the process of communicating through nonverbal signals.

00:20.678 --> 00:25.084
It includes things like our posture, facial expressions, gestures and more.

00:25.673 --> 00:28.166
The meanings of these all vary from culture to culture,...

00:28.263 --> 00:30.376
...but we instinctively read body language...

00:30.458 --> 00:35.237
...and interpret it as some expression of moods, feelings or intentions.

00:35.948 --> 00:39.025
So, in Alice's case, even before she speaks,...

00:39.205 --> 00:42.097
...she may be communicating all kinds of things to customers.

00:42.573 --> 00:46.207
For example, if her arms are crossed and she's avoiding eye contact,...

00:46.471 --> 00:49.207
...customers may not find her to be very approachable.

00:51.135 --> 00:53.432
However, Alice could be in a friendly mood...

00:53.577 --> 00:55.917
...even though her body language suggests otherwise...

00:56.723 --> 00:59.986
...and this isn't necessarily a conscious choice that she's made.

01:00.237 --> 01:03.005
This could just be how she habitually presents herself.

01:03.891 --> 01:06.812
But if Alice is aware of these habits,...

01:06.909 --> 01:09.213
...she can work on improving her body language.

01:10.390 --> 01:12.228
Changing your habits can be difficult,...

01:12.451 --> 01:16.178
...but if you take time to pause and check in with yourself,...

01:16.574 --> 01:18.795
...you can start to notice them and adjust things...

01:18.892 --> 01:20.979
...to become a better nonverbal communicator.

01:22.096 --> 01:25.451
This awareness can also be applied to reading other's body language.

01:26.117 --> 01:29.566
Let's say Alice notices that her co-worker is unusually quiet,...

01:29.772 --> 01:33.027
...has his body turned away from her and is slouched over.

01:33.777 --> 01:35.553
She may pick up that he's upset...

01:36.226 --> 01:38.405
...or that there's an unspoken issue at hand.

01:39.735 --> 01:41.638
Depending on Alice's relationship with him,...

01:41.723 --> 01:45.635
...she may want to give him some space or ask if anything is wrong.

01:47.269 --> 01:51.021
Being aware of the various aspects of body language can make all the difference...

01:51.118 --> 01:54.350
...in how people perceive you and how you perceive them.

01:54.882 --> 01:59.476
Be aware of how you present yourself and you can say a lot without speaking.
