00:00.791 --> 00:02.445
What do you do to get into character?

00:02.599 --> 00:03.127
What do I do?

00:03.210 --> 00:05.346
I can't give away all my secrets, Maisie.

00:05.459 --> 00:09.248
I like to be as prepared as possible going to work,...

00:09.472 --> 00:12.341
...but then, on the day, throwing that all away...

00:12.451 --> 00:15.807
...and being absolutely spontaneous and in the moment.

00:15.956 --> 00:17.286
This is for you, Willow.

00:17.375 --> 00:21.752
I'd love to know how you psych yourself up before getting on stage.

00:23.436 --> 00:25.708
I usually get really nervous before I go on stage...

00:25.809 --> 00:28.405
...so I try to kind of go into a little meditation.

00:28.489 --> 00:31.807
That always makes me feel so much more grounded and comfortable.

00:32.034 --> 00:37.247
Maisie, how do you balance your double career as an actress and an entrepreneur?

00:37.549 --> 00:40.329
Well Willow, not very easily.

00:41.469 --> 00:44.889
I think I really dedicate my time when I'm on set to being on set.

00:45.035 --> 00:47.553
But in between doing jobs, there's a lot of time...

00:47.657 --> 00:51.407
...and that's usually the time that I tend to fill with my other companies.
