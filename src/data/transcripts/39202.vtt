Hello, this is Spencer McKenna from Full Solutions.

00:07.507 --> 00:11.077
I'm calling to schedule a meeting to discuss your marketing strategy.

00:11.561 --> 00:13.157
Hello, Miss McKenna! I'm Josh.

00:13.461 --> 00:14.432
Thank you for calling.

00:15.041 --> 00:16.721
Setting up a meeting sounds like a good idea.

00:17.225 --> 00:17.516
Great!

00:17.985 --> 00:20.714
I'm glad you're still interested in setting up a meeting.

00:21.291 --> 00:23.917
Are you available some afternoon this week?

00:24.691 --> 00:27.505
Hmmm, I'm a little busy in the afternoon this week.

00:27.766 --> 00:29.248
How about a morning meeting?

00:30.601 --> 00:34.121
Unfortunately, a morning meeting is not possible this week.

00:34.889 --> 00:37.575
In that case, how does 1 p.m. this Friday sound?

00:39.821 --> 00:45.211
Okay, then I will schedule the meeting for 1 p.m. this Friday, June 25th.

00:45.496 --> 00:46.296
How does that sound?

00:47.065 --> 00:47.957
That sounds fine.

00:48.234 --> 00:49.373
Where will the meeting be held?

00:49.825 --> 00:50.276
Great.

00:50.773 --> 00:53.145
The meeting location will be at our offices...

00:53.429 --> 00:56.841
...so you can meet the whole team who will work on the marketing strategy.

00:57.127 --> 00:57.401
Great.

00:57.680 --> 00:59.251
I look forward to meeting the whole team.

00:59.642 --> 01:01.373
I look forward to meeting you then.

01:01.777 --> 01:04.487
I will send you a follow-up email to confirm the meeting.

01:04.738 --> 01:05.097
Thank you.

01:05.541 --> 01:08.083
Please let me know if you have any questions before the meeting.

01:08.437 --> 01:08.707
I will.

01:09.142 --> 01:09.573
Goodbye.

01:09.813 --> 01:10.410
Thank you.

01:10.611 --> 01:11.167
Goodbye.
