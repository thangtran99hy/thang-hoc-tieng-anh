This is how I followed up after my interview to get my job at S'well.

00:05.081 --> 00:07.943
S'well is a reusable water bottle company...

00:08.070 --> 00:12.123
...on a mission to rid the world of single-use plastic bottles.

00:12.209 --> 00:13.403
It's a really great place to work.

00:13.485 --> 00:16.267
I've been there for four years now and I love it.

00:17.043 --> 00:21.079
Once, I had gone in and interviewed and kind of connected with the hiring manager,...

00:21.361 --> 00:24.871
...I left knowing like, OK, I'm going to have to put together a portfolio...

00:24.950 --> 00:29.373
...to kind of show off some of these different skills that they were looking for,...

00:29.483 --> 00:32.871
...be it Photoshop or photography or copywriting.

00:32.956 --> 00:35.759
So, I went home and put myself to task.

00:35.838 --> 00:39.116
I grabbed the one S'well bottle I had and started going around the city...

00:39.193 --> 00:42.658
...and taking pictures, kind of setting up a mini studio in my apartment,...

00:42.997 --> 00:46.081
...taking videos or GIFs of my S'well bottle...

00:46.162 --> 00:49.283
...and sending them to the hiring manager in the hopes that they would land.

00:49.633 --> 00:54.197
I don't think it can ever hurt to express that you're really passionate about it,...

00:54.283 --> 00:57.266
...and you're very eager to learn and very determined to have that job.

00:57.378 --> 01:00.171
And if you have to follow up four times with no answer,...

01:00.256 --> 01:01.726
...then that's what you have to do.

01:02.314 --> 01:05.332
In the end, people are just looking to hire passionate people.

01:05.423 --> 01:08.345
And if you go the extra mile, I think it'll work to your benefit.
