So, tell me about yourself.

00:01.495 --> 00:06.131
Well, I just graduated with a degree in marketing and a focus in statistics.

00:06.275 --> 00:07.870
I've had a couple of internships...

00:08.261 --> 00:11.086
...where I was able to really use my love of number crunching...

00:11.177 --> 00:16.266
...to help analyze data so companies can strategize their campaigns.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.492
And that's why I think I'd be a really great fit here.
