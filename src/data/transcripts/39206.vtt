So, five days have gone by, you've not heard anything.

00:02.778 --> 00:04.033
Here's what to send.

00:04.279 --> 00:08.390
So, start your email with the subject heading of:...

00:08.666 --> 00:12.331
"Thank you following the interview on..." and then put the date.

00:12.513 --> 00:17.943
So, "Thank you following the interview on..." and then put the date the interview took place.

00:18.265 --> 00:22.555
And then put "Dear Sir" or "Dear Madam," whoever it was who was interviewing you.

00:22.942 --> 00:26.194
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank you..."

00:26.362 --> 00:30.523
"...for interviewing me for the position of... on the following date."

00:30.912 --> 00:35.630
"I am genuinely excited about the prospect of working for your organization."

00:35.955 --> 00:41.309
"If you need any further information, details or evidence to help you make a decision,..."

00:41.640 --> 00:43.674
"...please do not hesitate to contact me."

00:43.861 --> 00:45.483
"I look forward to hearing from you."

00:45.760 --> 00:48.341
"Yours faithfully," and then sign off with your name...

00:48.514 --> 00:52.747
...and don't forget to put your mobile telephone number at the end of the email...

00:53.005 --> 00:54.275
...so they can contact you.

00:54.536 --> 00:58.934
Now, that is a polite nudge or a reminder if you like to let them know...

00:59.010 --> 01:01.901
...that you're still very much interested in this position...

01:02.184 --> 01:04.078
...and it's sent in a professional manner.

01:04.281 --> 01:07.704
And that's the most important thing to do: it's to send it after five days...

01:07.801 --> 01:09.088
...if you've not heard anything...

01:09.341 --> 01:12.635
...and make sure the email follow-up is professional.
