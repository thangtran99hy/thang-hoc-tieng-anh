So, whenever an interviewer contacts you to tell you that you haven't been successful,...

00:05.793 --> 00:08.498
...always reply but be positive.

00:08.826 --> 00:11.371
We need to demonstrate to them that they have missed out,...

00:11.499 --> 00:13.336
...that you are the professional person.

00:13.437 --> 00:14.269
You are mature.

00:14.675 --> 00:19.035
But, that you also understand that you weren't the right person for their organization...

00:19.119 --> 00:20.413
...at that particular time.

00:20.701 --> 00:21.743
But, you need to say to them:...

00:22.206 --> 00:23.918
"...Thank you very much for contacting me...

00:24.273 --> 00:27.257
...and for giving me the opportunity to be interviewed for the position.

00:27.705 --> 00:28.761
Whilst I am disappointed,...

00:28.836 --> 00:32.409
...I understand that I wasn't the right person at this particular time."

00:32.571 --> 00:34.112
However, if you change your mind...

00:34.343 --> 00:37.085
...or if it doesn't work with the other person you have chosen,...

00:37.377 --> 00:39.587
...please do not hesitate to get back in touch with me...

00:39.797 --> 00:42.420
...because I genuinely want to work for your organization."

00:42.509 --> 00:45.617
If you said that to me when I turned you down for a job,...

00:45.799 --> 00:48.425
...I would think to myself: "Wow, this person really is professional!"

00:48.760 --> 00:52.880
And if it didn't work out with the person I'd chosen, I would come back to you.

00:53.068 --> 00:55.009
And the thing to remember is this does happen.

00:55.583 --> 00:57.947
It might not work out with the person they've chosen...

00:58.208 --> 01:00.727
...and they might come back to you, so always be professional.

01:01.013 --> 01:05.552
Never demonstrate any form of anger, frustration or negativity...

01:05.816 --> 01:09.605
...when responding to a job interview rejection.
