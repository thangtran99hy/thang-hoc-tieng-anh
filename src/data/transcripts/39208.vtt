Spencer, will you call a client for me to set up a meeting with our team?

00:04.869 --> 00:05.252
Sure!

00:05.400 --> 00:06.420
I'd be happy to.

00:06.615 --> 00:07.357
Who's the client?

00:08.119 --> 00:11.411
The client is a new company interested in developing a marketing strategy.

00:12.331 --> 00:12.615
Alright.

00:12.786 --> 00:15.847
What should I tell them about the meeting date and location?

00:16.116 --> 00:22.117
Hmm, any afternoon this week works, so they can choose.

00:22.662 --> 00:26.732
As for the location, it will be in our conference room with the rest of the team.
