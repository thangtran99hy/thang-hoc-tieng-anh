00:00.644 --> 00:01.059
Natalie?

00:01.197 --> 00:02.033
Morning, Mr. Cobb.

00:02.233 --> 00:05.551
Look, I'm gonna need to rearrange some meetings for today, free up some time midday.

00:05.648 --> 00:06.644
You've got meetings midday.

00:06.769 --> 00:07.527
I've got meetings all day.

00:07.646 --> 00:07.959
Yeah.

00:08.376 --> 00:10.237
Maybe we can move this 1 o'clock to 5.

00:10.334 --> 00:11.587
There's a meeting at 5.

00:13.135 --> 00:14.991
But, I'm gonna need some time for lunch at some point.

00:15.090 --> 00:15.674
What sort of lunch?

00:15.762 --> 00:16.035
What?

00:16.283 --> 00:17.164
What sort of lunch do you like?

00:17.269 --> 00:19.350
I'll set up a meeting to discuss lunch options.

00:19.458 --> 00:21.882
I don't want a meeting, I want to eat at 1 o'clock.

00:21.989 --> 00:22.961
You've got a meeting at 1 o'clock.

00:23.067 --> 00:23.876
I know I've got...

00:24.963 --> 00:25.869
What is this one o'clock?

00:25.969 --> 00:27.317
Boardroom availability.

00:27.558 --> 00:27.924
What's that?

00:28.032 --> 00:30.688
It's a meeting to discuss the availability of the boardrooms.

00:31.395 --> 00:32.351
Availability for?

00:32.439 --> 00:33.172
Meetings.

00:33.519 --> 00:35.885
Right, so this is a meeting to discuss having a meeting.

00:36.014 --> 00:37.747
No, that's at 4 p.m.

00:37.977 --> 00:39.053
Right, let's strip some of this out.

00:39.137 --> 00:41.131
Let's get rid of that boardroom meeting thing,...

00:41.757 --> 00:44.261
...the conference call, and definitely the visits to the toilet.

00:44.719 --> 00:46.210
That'll give me some time.

00:47.463 --> 00:48.333
Who are you calling?

00:48.462 --> 00:49.348
Heads of department.

00:49.519 --> 00:52.483
Emergency meeting to discuss the rearrangement of your meeting schedule.

00:52.685 --> 00:54.017
I'll pick out the afternoon.
