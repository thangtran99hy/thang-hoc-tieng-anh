It might seem like men are generally stronger than women, but the truth isn't so simple.

00:05.949 --> 00:09.500
Both boys and girls have advantages and disadvantages...

00:09.615 --> 00:13.033
...that end up evening out to relatively equal strength.

00:13.243 --> 00:14.069
Here's how.

00:14.343 --> 00:19.773
It is true that men are generally taller, heavier and have bigger muscles than women.

00:20.097 --> 00:22.165
Studies have shown that on average,...

00:22.297 --> 00:28.599
...men have over 20 pounds of extra muscle and 30 to 40% more upper body strength.

00:29.116 --> 00:34.856
That's because men naturally produce more of the hormone testosterone than women,...

00:35.003 --> 00:37.615
...which is what helps your muscles grow big.

00:37.977 --> 00:41.827
But girls are much better at fighting off diseases.

00:42.017 --> 00:44.567
Women's bodies make more of the antibodies...

00:44.663 --> 00:48.421
...and blood cells you need to fight off illness much faster than men.

00:48.826 --> 00:52.989
That means on average, girls get less infectious diseases...

00:53.227 --> 00:55.902
...and recover faster when they do get sick.

00:56.097 --> 00:57.765
Now, back to the boys.

00:57.919 --> 01:03.720
Men generally have bigger hearts, lungs and veins known as the cardiovascular system.

01:03.891 --> 01:07.463
That means boys' bodies can keep more energy stored for later.

01:07.761 --> 01:11.865
All that blood flow also helps boys to heal faster from wounds.

01:12.160 --> 01:13.389
But to make up for that,...

01:13.577 --> 01:16.432
...women are likely to have lower blood pressure than men,...

01:16.531 --> 01:20.846
...which means they're less likely to get cardiovascular disease in the first place.

01:21.091 --> 01:25.915
Boys have a smaller chance of becoming depressed or developing an anxiety disorder,...

01:26.082 --> 01:29.648
...but girls are less likely to develop psychiatric disorders.

01:29.984 --> 01:32.411
So, are boys stronger than girls?

01:32.627 --> 01:37.438
Well, if you're just looking at muscle mass then yes, boys are typically stronger,...

01:37.619 --> 01:41.285
...but the science shows us that boys and girls are both strong...

01:41.400 --> 01:43.481
...just in slightly different ways.
