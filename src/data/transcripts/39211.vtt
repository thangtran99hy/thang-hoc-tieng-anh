00:00.521 --> 00:01.526
I run a small shop.

00:02.040 --> 00:04.126
I expect my communication to be simple.

00:04.367 --> 00:06.011
We look for every advantage we can get.

00:06.125 --> 00:08.428
Especially with our communications technology.

00:10.824 --> 00:13.622
With a business phone that can ring on any device...

00:13.859 --> 00:16.321
...and the ability to forward calls anywhere I need...

00:16.617 --> 00:18.981
...and taking messages when I can't answer.

00:19.507 --> 00:21.563
It's so much more than just a phone system.

00:22.270 --> 00:26.988
All of our projects, files and communications are right here organized into workflows.

00:29.736 --> 00:33.277
I can make a business call from my mobile and nobody can see my personal number.

00:33.818 --> 00:38.243
Same device, but now, it always looks like I'm at work.

00:39.265 --> 00:42.559
We can jump from chat into voice or video calls with just a click.

00:42.827 --> 00:43.991
The integrated address book...

00:44.085 --> 00:47.503
...means that we are all working from the same contact info, simple.

00:48.118 --> 00:55.127
At the end of the month, it's predictable pricing on one single bill, no surprises.

00:55.495 --> 01:00.337
Advanced communications all wrapped up into one secure, reliable and affordable service.
