00:05.505 --> 00:09.021
Is life worth living?

00:10.598 --> 00:15.833
Yes, so long as there is wrong to right,...

00:16.561 --> 00:20.095
Wail of the weak against the strong,...

00:20.773 --> 00:23.118
Or tyranny to fight;...

00:24.580 --> 00:28.487
Long as there lingers gloom to chase,...

00:28.981 --> 00:32.083
Or streaming tear to dry,...

00:32.891 --> 00:37.791
One kindred woe, one sorrowing face...

00:38.467 --> 00:41.657
That smiles as we draw nigh:...

00:43.549 --> 00:48.152
Long as a tale of anguish swells the heart,...

00:48.505 --> 00:50.669
...and lids grow wet,...

00:51.281 --> 00:53.899
And at the sound of Christmas bells...

00:54.367 --> 00:56.578
We pardon and forget;...

00:58.160 --> 01:01.564
So long as faith with freedom reigns,...

01:02.115 --> 01:04.737
And loyal hope survives,...

01:05.693 --> 01:08.830
And gracious charity remains...

01:09.503 --> 01:12.057
To leaven lowly lives;...

01:13.555 --> 01:16.738
While there is one untrodden tract...

01:17.299 --> 01:19.351
For intellect or will,...

01:19.949 --> 01:23.452
And men are free to think and act...

01:24.918 --> 01:28.049
Life is worth living still.
