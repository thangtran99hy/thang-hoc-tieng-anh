00:00.050 --> 00:03.448
A 2018 survey by Blind, an anonymous workplace chat app,...

00:03.835 --> 00:09.307
...found that over 50% of the close to 11,500 tech workers surveyed answered 'yes'...

00:09.397 --> 00:11.669
...when asked if they currently suffered from job burnout.

00:11.919 --> 00:14.935
Compare that to a 2019 survey of 15,000 physicians,...

00:15.213 --> 00:18.042
...only 42% of who said that they felt burnt out,...

00:18.724 --> 00:21.094
...and the pandemic only seems to have made things worse.

00:21.400 --> 00:25.644
A 2020 survey by Blind showed that 68% of tech workers felt more burnt out...

00:25.731 --> 00:28.343
...while working from home than while working from the office.

00:29.065 --> 00:32.151
The survey included over 3,000 employees working at companies...

00:32.241 --> 00:35.213
...like Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple and Google.

00:37.340 --> 00:38.475
Beyond the day-to-day pressure,...

00:38.571 --> 00:42.178
...some said stagnation played a role in their decision to leave their tech jobs.

00:42.474 --> 00:46.990
In fact, a 2020 survey of more than 4,000 tech workers found that following salary,...

00:47.328 --> 00:50.519
...the opportunity to learn new skills was the second largest motivator...

00:50.599 --> 00:51.856
...to accept a new job offer.

00:52.259 --> 00:54.650
The same survey found that 58% of tech workers...

00:54.730 --> 00:56.754
...would leave their current job for another one...

00:57.123 --> 00:59.798
...if presented new challenges and problems to solve.
