I've come up with five, easy to implement steps...

00:02.629 --> 00:07.314
...that can take your calendar from working against you to working for you.

00:07.541 --> 00:08.472
And they really work.

00:08.573 --> 00:10.125
We worked with a big global company...

00:10.211 --> 00:13.491
...and asked some of their leaders to put these tips into practice while others didn't.

00:13.973 --> 00:14.631
And guess what?

00:15.057 --> 00:16.619
The leaders who used these steps...

00:16.692 --> 00:21.627
...saw significant hours open up on their calendars for, you know, actual work.

00:21.997 --> 00:26.126
Tip number one: Ask yourself, "Do you really need the meeting?"

00:26.603 --> 00:29.247
We're under the illusion that we need a meeting for everything.

00:29.521 --> 00:32.834
We think "I need to make sure so-and-so is okay with this, so I'll book time."...

00:32.953 --> 00:35.473
...or "I've got a quick question on process, I'll grab a meeting."

00:35.714 --> 00:38.265
The reality is, for almost half of the meetings we schedule,...

00:38.504 --> 00:41.952
...we could simply pick up the phone or shoot a text for a quick answer.

00:42.467 --> 00:43.731
A trick to stop this:...

00:43.893 --> 00:48.177
...when you're thinking of calling a meeting, write the invitation first.

00:48.638 --> 00:51.591
And if you can't start with a subject line with an action verb,...

00:51.981 --> 00:53.411
...you shouldn't have the meeting.

00:53.818 --> 00:56.152
"Decide, finalize, create next steps."

00:56.363 --> 00:58.047
Those are reasons to call a meeting.

00:58.331 --> 01:01.376
"Review," on the other hand, isn't an action verb.
