Hi my name is Jesse Goldhammer...

00:01.588 --> 00:04.603
...and I'm the associate dean at UC Berkeley School of Information...

00:05.012 --> 00:06.661
...with another Kantola learning minute.

00:07.489 --> 00:08.522
Today Mike asks,...

00:09.094 --> 00:13.381
"What's the truth about using the internet in my local coffee shop or at the airport?"

00:13.812 --> 00:19.489
Well, the truth is that those public wi-fi networks are insecure.

00:19.959 --> 00:22.320
Even if you're using a password to access them.

00:22.644 --> 00:25.491
And the reason is that there may be others on that network...

00:25.669 --> 00:27.812
...who may also be using that password...

00:28.151 --> 00:31.453
...who can potentially get access to information on your computer...

00:31.575 --> 00:36.248
...or can access information that your computer is sending elsewhere on the internet.

00:36.693 --> 00:38.382
There are two things you can do to stay safe.

00:38.473 --> 00:42.413
The first is when you're on the wi-fi network, the public wi-fi network,...

00:42.583 --> 00:44.601
...don't access information that is sensitive.

00:44.683 --> 00:47.473
So don't log on to your bank account to conduct the transaction.

00:47.999 --> 00:51.603
The better solution is to use a virtual private network or VPN.

00:51.953 --> 00:55.957
What that software does is it encrypts the data that moves from your computer...

00:56.059 --> 00:59.723
...elsewhere on the internet so even if someone else is accessing it,...

01:00.025 --> 01:01.131
...they won't be able to read it.

01:01.886 --> 01:02.566
Thank you so much.
