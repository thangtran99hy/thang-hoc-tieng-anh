Timothy, what's the status with the Linear Solutions?

00:04.202 --> 00:06.471
Could you give us the latest on the Square project?

00:06.831 --> 00:10.917
The Linear Solutions department has yet again functioned at full capacity...

00:11.179 --> 00:14.578
...and we have fulfilled 114 percent of this month's objectives.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.422
Overall, we have very good progress with the design.

00:17.837 --> 00:19.410
Are we on track with the schedule?

00:19.925 --> 00:21.605
When are we required to start delivering?

00:22.243 --> 00:26.047
I'm happy to report that we are ready to start first deliveries tomorrow,...

00:26.195 --> 00:28.467
...which is way ahead of the requested delivery schedule.

00:28.945 --> 00:31.783
We've only just finished system testing the prototype...

00:31.895 --> 00:34.181
...and are only halfway through performance testing.

00:34.555 --> 00:37.081
We haven't even released an alpha version yet.

00:37.477 --> 00:39.911
As I said earlier, we've had very good progress with the design.

00:40.045 --> 00:46.399
Yes, we've had very good progress; but I'd say the design of the product is only 75 percent complete.

00:46.565 --> 00:47.281
Well, exactly.

00:47.422 --> 00:48.770
That's 3 out of every 4.

00:49.167 --> 00:51.128
So, we're ready to start shipping tomorrow.

00:51.371 --> 00:51.543
What?

00:51.871 --> 00:54.160
It doesn't work like that.

00:55.454 --> 00:58.979
We'll produce, say, 4 units, but only ship the first 3!

00:59.383 --> 01:02.068
Then, when you're finally 100 percent complete with the design,...

01:02.447 --> 01:04.095
...we can then ship the fourth.

01:07.604 --> 01:08.788
Excellent work, Timothy!

01:09.053 --> 01:10.075
You can proceed with the production.

01:10.778 --> 01:14.825
Anderson, send me, please a revised delivery schedule, so I can share it with the client.

01:15.469 --> 01:19.577
Well, thank you, everyone! This was very productive.

01:20.061 --> 01:20.666
Yet again!
