00:00.175 --> 00:02.755
I was thinking accounting might be a good fit....

00:02.894 --> 00:06.906
...because I really clicked with Oscar and I do have some experience with bookkeeping.

00:07.140 --> 00:10.381
But, we already have a surplus of accountants as it is.

00:10.612 --> 00:14.110
I would work in customer service, HR even.

00:14.211 --> 00:15.988
Those are fully staffed as well.

00:16.135 --> 00:19.741
Are you telling me that there is no one in this entire office...

00:20.013 --> 00:22.245
...that could use an extra pair of hands?

00:23.225 --> 00:24.073
Yes!

00:24.304 --> 00:29.683
I am the CEO and I am telling an employee of mine what to do.

00:30.606 --> 00:32.893
Let me beat around the bush for a second.

00:33.319 --> 00:37.137
Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings...

00:37.292 --> 00:37.929
Robert, it's all right.

00:38.027 --> 00:39.839
This is very uncomfortable.

00:40.007 --> 00:44.044
Obviously, there's no place for me here, so thank you for trying.

00:44.136 --> 00:44.887
Why don't we just let it go?

00:44.982 --> 00:46.185
No, absolutely not.

00:46.331 --> 00:49.615
Andrew, there must be something you can do, there must be.

00:49.906 --> 00:50.482
Think.

00:52.407 --> 00:54.042
Well, there are a lot of considerations.

00:54.261 --> 00:58.123
I would be eternally grateful.

00:59.261 --> 01:02.726
It's not a bad thing to have the CEO owe you one.

01:06.624 --> 01:07.253
All right.

01:08.113 --> 01:09.267
Well, then welcome aboard!

01:09.939 --> 01:11.661
Yeah, perfect!

01:16.191 --> 01:17.100
So, what happens next?

01:17.362 --> 01:21.937
We get you over to HR and then get you set up with accounting.

01:22.951 --> 01:23.325
Hang on.
