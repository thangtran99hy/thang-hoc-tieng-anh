Depression is a disorder that afflicts over 10% of the world's population,...

00:06.310 --> 00:08.489
...but we as a society know little about it.

00:08.907 --> 00:11.520
Stereotypes tell us that depressed people are weak,...

00:11.761 --> 00:13.624
...unless they happen to be a tortured artist.

00:14.055 --> 00:17.161
It can be difficult to understand depression because it's invisible.

00:17.721 --> 00:21.014
It's a disorder defined by thoughts, behaviors, and feelings...

00:21.365 --> 00:24.658
...rather than obvious symptoms like vomiting, rashes, or fever.

00:25.444 --> 00:27.225
Those who have experienced depression...

00:27.377 --> 00:30.345
...are all too familiar with comments from misguided friends such as:...

00:30.502 --> 00:33.201
..."Snap out of it" or "Just get up and do something."

00:33.884 --> 00:35.015
Even those with depression...

00:35.291 --> 00:38.151
...might have a hard time understanding what they are experiencing,...

00:38.532 --> 00:41.454
...and they often blame themselves for not being able to snap out of it.

00:42.305 --> 00:46.280
To understand what depression really is, we need to talk about symptoms.

00:46.729 --> 00:50.579
First of all, depression has symptoms related to how someone feels.

00:51.092 --> 00:59.680
These symptoms include nearly constant feelings of sadness, anger, guilt, or hopelessness.

01:00.477 --> 01:03.182
Next, there are symptoms related to behavior.

01:03.599 --> 01:09.431
They include social withdrawal, a lack of energy, low motivation,...

01:10.649 --> 01:17.444
...poor concentration, sleep problems, or significant changes in appetite.

01:18.193 --> 01:22.353
Finally, symptoms related to thoughts include poor self-esteem,...

01:23.011 --> 01:27.201
...thoughts of suicide, and loss of interest in regular activities.

01:28.322 --> 01:32.483
Symptoms of depression must last at least one week, and they are often cyclical.

01:33.067 --> 01:36.856
This means that the symptoms can come and go over a period of months or years.

01:37.375 --> 01:41.629
A person who experiences depression once is likely to have future episodes.
