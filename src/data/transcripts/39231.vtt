00:01.668 --> 00:03.599
Here we have the comma bird.

00:04.097 --> 00:08.195
It sits on the line in the middle of a sentence and takes a little rest.

00:14.223 --> 00:16.712
So, when do you use a comma bird?

00:18.376 --> 00:23.217
When you want to add some extra information to a sentence, you separate it with a comma.

00:24.816 --> 00:28.233
It lets you take a little rest and breathe before going on.

00:31.091 --> 00:34.757
The different parts of the sentence are called a clause.

00:35.909 --> 00:39.450
Here is a sentence with two parts, two clauses.

00:40.953 --> 00:47.338
My friends and I were hungry, so we ate an amazing pizza.

00:50.404 --> 00:52.893
Ideas are linked together with a comma.

01:02.283 --> 01:05.205
Comma birds are also used to list things.

01:06.877 --> 01:14.693
The pizza had cheese, olives, pepperoni, ham and pineapple.

01:16.243 --> 01:19.604
But too many comma birds will be too heavy on the line.

01:23.814 --> 01:26.673
Never use a comma when you can use a period.
