It's easy to enjoy Mykonos town with no planning, no tour and no guide.

00:05.131 --> 00:08.837
This is a stop which lends itself to unstructured free time,...

00:09.154 --> 00:12.540
...just lazing on the beach, wandering and browsing the shops.

00:13.396 --> 00:15.528
It's the epitome of a Greek island town:...

00:15.741 --> 00:19.345
...a busy breakwater, fine little beach and inviting lanes.

00:20.274 --> 00:25.062
While tourism dominates the economy, Mykonos still has a traditional charm,...

00:25.283 --> 00:31.301
...thickly layered with white stucco, blue trim and colorful bougainvillea.

00:33.668 --> 00:37.302
Back lanes offer tranquility away from the cruise crowds.

00:38.722 --> 00:40.770
As in many Greek island towns,...

00:40.880 --> 00:44.793
...centuries ago, the windmills of Mykonos harnessed the steady wind,...

00:45.029 --> 00:47.179
...grinding grain to feed its sailors.

00:48.517 --> 00:53.668
Five mills still stand, perfectly positioned to catch the prevailing breeze.

00:54.807 --> 00:58.565
A tidy embankment is so pretty, they call it "Little Venice."

00:59.159 --> 01:02.098
Wealthy shipping merchants built this row of fine mansions...

01:02.192 --> 01:06.445
...with brightly painted wooden balconies that seem to rise right out of the sea.

01:07.883 --> 01:11.359
Today, these mansions have been refitted as restaurants and bars...

01:11.453 --> 01:15.459
...for tourists enjoying fresh fish and romantic views.
