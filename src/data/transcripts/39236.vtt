Hello and bienvenido to Cusco.

00:02.506 --> 00:05.737
This is one of the most beautiful cities in all of South America,...

00:05.944 --> 00:08.497
...and not only is it the gateway to Machu Picchu,...

00:08.717 --> 00:11.507
...but it was once the capital of the ancient Incan Empire...

00:11.598 --> 00:14.644
...and there is a lot of beautiful things to see and do here.

00:17.412 --> 00:21.944
The history and cultures of both the Inca and colonial Spanish are both present in Cusco...

00:22.301 --> 00:24.944
...and part of what makes the city so vibrant and fascinating.

00:25.781 --> 00:28.078
In Cusco, you'll find extraordinary textiles,...

00:28.206 --> 00:30.753
...archaeological wonders and lively gatherings.

00:35.328 --> 00:38.379
This market is definitely one of my favorite places in all of Cusco.

00:38.477 --> 00:41.981
It's full of color and it's just an explosion for the senses.

00:44.647 --> 00:47.101
This is Qorikancha, the sun temple,...

00:47.191 --> 00:50.237
...and it was the most important temple for the Incan religion,...

00:50.451 --> 00:54.303
...and if you can imagine, it used to be completely covered in gold.

00:56.127 --> 01:00.543
This beautiful, brightly colored bustling market town is called Pisac...

01:00.666 --> 01:05.550
...and this is where you come when you want to find traditional Peruvian handicrafts.

01:09.693 --> 01:10.804
Check this out my friends,...

01:10.907 --> 01:16.306
...one of the most recognizable ancient ruins in all of the world: Machu Picchu.

01:17.278 --> 01:21.111
The ancient mythical site of Machu Picchu built in the clouds of the Andes Mountains...

01:21.207 --> 01:23.727
...is a bucket list site for almost anyone who travels.
