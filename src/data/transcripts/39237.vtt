Any Lord of the Rings fan knows that much of the movie was shot here in New Zealand,...

00:04.125 --> 00:07.078
...but did you also know that you can actually visit one of the movie sets?

00:07.300 --> 00:11.039
Today, we are headed off together to go visit Hobbiton, otherwise known as the Shire.

00:11.220 --> 00:11.654
Let's go.

00:16.349 --> 00:20.249
If you come on tour with us, you walk around with a knowledgeable guide.

00:20.451 --> 00:23.869
There's 44 hobbit holes; no two hobbit holes are the same.

00:24.117 --> 00:30.220
Thirty-three percent of all people who come on tour here have never read the books, never seen the movies,...

00:30.339 --> 00:32.673
...but they still go away overwhelmed.

00:34.190 --> 00:36.655
It's amazing! Every detail is taken care of.

00:36.753 --> 00:40.333
If you look in the windows, you can see all the dishes and cups.

00:42.588 --> 00:43.757
The great thing about this tour...

00:43.842 --> 00:46.225
...is whether or not you know anything about Lord of the Rings,...

00:46.531 --> 00:49.821
...it's a little fairy tale world that you can immerse yourself in.

00:50.393 --> 00:52.400
The details are fantastic...

00:52.494 --> 00:54.474
...and just the scenery is outstanding.

00:55.686 --> 00:57.889
Oh my gosh! It's the one from the movie!

00:57.981 --> 01:00.053
This is Bilbo Baggins' hobbit hole.
