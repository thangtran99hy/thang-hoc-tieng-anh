00:00.699 --> 00:05.645
The invasion of the apostrophes has begun.

00:06.580 --> 00:12.325
At precisely sometime this morning, the two words, "it" and "is"...

00:12.649 --> 00:14.727
...were part of an apostrophe incident.

00:19.999 --> 00:22.449
One of the letters was removed.

00:23.705 --> 00:31.629
The letter "i" was replaced by the apostrophe, making a new shorter word "it's."

00:33.208 --> 00:39.192
At exactly sometime in the afternoon, two more words, "I" and "have,"...

00:39.419 --> 00:41.336
...were approached by an apostrophe.

00:43.968 --> 00:46.197
This time, two letters were removed!

00:47.091 --> 00:52.555
The remaining letters huddle together, unaware that an apostrophe...

00:52.853 --> 00:55.753
...has replaced the letters that were between them.

00:56.902 --> 01:02.629
The apostrophe caused the two words to contract into a single, shorter word.

01:04.135 --> 01:08.883
For their own protection, we have protected these words at this facility.

01:09.819 --> 01:12.913
Does not.

01:14.245 --> 01:14.517
Wait!

01:14.981 --> 01:15.775
What's this?

01:17.643 --> 01:21.492
Those fiendish apostrophes; they've taken the "o"!

01:22.480 --> 01:23.281
Doesn't.

01:24.473 --> 01:26.324
Is no word safe?

01:27.176 --> 01:28.469
Watch the skies!

01:28.701 --> 01:29.831
They're everywhere.

01:30.167 --> 01:34.051
It's the invasion of the apostrophes!
