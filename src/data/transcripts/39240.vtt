Hello Jenny. How are you today?

00:02.424 --> 00:03.878
Oh, hello Mr Jones.

00:04.170 --> 00:05.163
I'm fine, thank you.

00:05.705 --> 00:08.317
Jenny, let me introduce you to Claire Smith.

00:08.565 --> 00:11.131
Claire will be taking over as shop manager from Carol...

00:11.219 --> 00:12.731
...when she leaves at the end of the month.

00:13.609 --> 00:17.026
Claire, Jenny is one of our three full-time shop assistants.

00:17.637 --> 00:18.774
Pleased to meet you, Jenny.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.318
Pleased to meet you too.

00:20.699 --> 00:22.063
Have you been working here long?

00:22.545 --> 00:23.695
Almost two years now.

00:24.023 --> 00:25.782
I started right after leaving school.

00:26.767 --> 00:29.657
Oh, and this is Simon Thompson, our accountant.

00:29.911 --> 00:31.235
Simon's from Down Under.

00:31.663 --> 00:32.289
How do you do?

00:32.812 --> 00:34.001
Pleased to meet you, Simon.

00:34.403 --> 00:36.332
I've always wanted to visit Australia.

00:36.499 --> 00:37.830
It's a beautiful country.

00:38.223 --> 00:39.531
I'm not gonna disagree.

00:40.027 --> 00:44.436
Claire will be taking over from Carol, who, as you know, will be leaving us soon.

00:44.984 --> 00:47.041
Yes, I've heard a lot about you.

00:47.501 --> 00:48.645
Good things, I hope!

00:49.062 --> 00:49.691
Of course.

00:50.185 --> 00:52.116
Anyway, welcome to Chic Boutique.

00:52.859 --> 00:54.347
I'm sure you'll enjoy working here.

00:54.719 --> 00:55.995
It's a very friendly place.

00:56.415 --> 00:58.595
Yes, I'm really looking forward to getting started.
