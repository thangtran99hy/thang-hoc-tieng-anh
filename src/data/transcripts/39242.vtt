Welcome to the world of Squid Game.

00:05.951 --> 00:09.253
We will now play six games with other participants.

00:09.417 --> 00:10.817
Welcome to the Fortnite Squid Game.

00:11.083 --> 00:14.331
You are all here because of declining Fortnite prize pools and views.

00:14.455 --> 00:17.523
You chose to be here of your own free will unless eliminated.

00:17.795 --> 00:19.471
We'll be playing six games.

00:19.691 --> 00:23.212
Instructions on how each game works will be given at the start of each round.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.010
Every time a player is eliminated,...

00:25.486 --> 00:28.051
...five thousand V-Bucks will be added to the prize pool.

00:28.203 --> 00:29.274
Here is the first game.

00:29.480 --> 00:31.871
You will be playing "Red light, green light."

00:32.014 --> 00:35.245
Now then, you are allowed to move forward when it shouts "Green light!"

00:35.425 --> 00:37.211
Stop when it shouts "Red light!"

00:37.371 --> 00:40.256
If your movement is detected afterwards, you will be eliminated.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.233
The second game is sugar honeycombs.

00:43.425 --> 00:46.465
The shape you have chosen is the shape you must remove from the honeycomb.

00:46.595 --> 00:49.385
Use the pistol given to shoot the target displayed.

00:49.581 --> 00:53.537
If you miss any targets, you will crack the honeycomb and be eliminated.
