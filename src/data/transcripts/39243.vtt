00:00.350 --> 00:02.925
I'd like to welcome you to the third game.

00:03.134 --> 00:04.597
Today's game is tug-of-war.

00:04.697 --> 00:07.788
There are three targets between the two platforms.

00:07.875 --> 00:11.967
In order to win, you must shoot the target marked by a lit green light.

00:12.130 --> 00:15.462
For each successful shot, your team will be pushed further from the ledge.

00:16.313 --> 00:20.797
Your opponents will be shoved closer in an attempt to drop your opponents down below.

00:21.033 --> 00:23.778
The fifth game is glass stepping stones.

00:25.567 --> 00:29.147
Stepping stones before you are made from one of two types of glass.

00:29.308 --> 00:31.775
One will be tempered glass; the other will be normal.

00:31.930 --> 00:36.093
The tempered glass stepping stones are strong enough to hold the weight of two players.

00:36.389 --> 00:40.295
However, the normal glass will break, even if just one steps on it.

00:40.417 --> 00:46.107
In this game, you will guess which one of the two next tiles is made of the stronger tempered glass.

00:46.686 --> 00:49.171
You only step on those to cross the ten pairs of tile.

00:49.427 --> 00:53.011
You may then cross over the other side safely and pass this game.

00:53.339 --> 00:55.124
With that, let the game begin.
