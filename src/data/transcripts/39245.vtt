Hi! This is BLACKPINK from South Korea.

00:09.258 --> 00:12.729
We released our Enhanced album in 2020...

00:14.158 --> 00:17.067
...and it was a really interesting opportunity for us...

00:17.157 --> 00:20.471
...because we got to become more personal with our fans.

00:20.573 --> 00:22.801
So instead of just listening to our music,...

00:22.914 --> 00:28.158
...our fans could get their hands on exclusive videos, storylines and canvases...

00:28.533 --> 00:33.313
...and so I think it was a lot of fun for both us and blinks.

00:34.375 --> 00:36.075
So, the concept of the video...

00:36.198 --> 00:40.637
...was to depict two contrasting sides of our group black and pink...

00:40.989 --> 00:45.057
...and so it was a whole lot of fun being two different moods for the day.

00:45.882 --> 00:48.441
Many people use Spotify globally...

00:48.529 --> 00:52.287
...so it helps us reach fans from around the world instantly.

00:52.821 --> 00:55.869
And we were so shocked because we never imagined...

00:55.978 --> 00:59.501
...to have so many people across different countries to listen to our music.

01:00.187 --> 01:04.404
We were really excited to hear that Spotify is finally launching in Korea.

01:04.635 --> 01:09.415
We're glad that our Korean fan will gain access to a larger range of music...

01:09.579 --> 01:12.329
...and provide new artists to share their music to the world.
