00:00.163 --> 00:01.723
Can you tell me why you want to work for us?

00:02.485 --> 00:05.284
Yes, I want to work for you for three main reasons.

00:05.737 --> 00:09.926
The first reason is when I saw the job advertised, I was quite excited...

00:10.032 --> 00:13.086
...because you have a really strong reputation...

00:13.310 --> 00:15.953
...as being a market leader within this industry.

00:16.176 --> 00:18.577
Now that's good for me because I have high standards...

00:18.870 --> 00:23.832
...and I feel as your manager, you will support me to achieve my objectives.

00:24.062 --> 00:27.586
The second reason is there are lots of really good reviews online...

00:27.666 --> 00:29.181
...that are left by your customers.

00:29.439 --> 00:31.859
So that tells me you always put your customers first,...

00:32.149 --> 00:35.677
...you do things right, and again, you set very high standards.

00:36.069 --> 00:38.402
The third and final reason why I want to work for you...

00:38.574 --> 00:41.458
...is because you clearly have ambitious plans for the future.

00:41.816 --> 00:45.666
I am somebody who doesn't want to sit still and just do the same thing day in day out.

00:45.884 --> 00:50.540
I want to feel like I am progressing with the organization I am being a manager for...

00:50.713 --> 00:53.015
...and clearly, that is the case with your organization.

00:53.229 --> 00:55.780
So, I feel like I can come with you on your journey...

00:55.971 --> 00:59.481
...and achieve consistent success moving forward into the future.
