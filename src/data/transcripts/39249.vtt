OK, so they say, what's your leadership style?

00:03.971 --> 00:05.041
This is what I would say.

00:06.164 --> 00:09.969
Well, I don't have one single leadership style.

00:11.129 --> 00:14.235
Different situations require different handling.

00:14.657 --> 00:20.543
And in the past, I've had to adopt, on occasion,...

00:20.882 --> 00:26.986
...a very autocratic, authoritarian leadership style for some situations...

00:27.069 --> 00:28.291
...because that's what was needed.

00:29.777 --> 00:34.156
But my default leadership style, if I have one,...

00:34.640 --> 00:37.968
...is more of a consultative leadership style...

00:38.067 --> 00:41.321
...where I, especially if I have good employees,...

00:41.752 --> 00:49.093
...I consult individually with a lot of my employees to get their two cents on the situation...

00:49.200 --> 00:51.281
...and what they feel is the right course of action...

00:51.361 --> 00:54.440
...just to sort of incorporate that into my decision.

00:55.313 --> 01:02.313
And also in the past, I've had to adopt a participative leadership style,...

01:02.410 --> 01:06.307
...where you get everybody together and you hammer it out.

01:06.383 --> 01:09.371
You get everybody's opinion on it and it kind of goes back and forth...

01:09.467 --> 01:13.472
...and that tends to work very well if you know it's a very complex decision...

01:13.556 --> 01:15.371
...that affects everybody in multiple ways.

01:16.765 --> 01:20.818
You know, so that's something that I've employed on occasion.
