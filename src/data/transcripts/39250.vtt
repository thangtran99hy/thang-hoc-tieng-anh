00:00.050 --> 00:01.987
So, Chris, were you able to investigate...

00:02.085 --> 00:05.178
...whether Skill Source had the curriculum offerings we were looking for?

00:05.747 --> 00:07.667
Yes, and the answer is, "Yes, they do."

00:08.939 --> 00:12.187
I looked at the budget and they're well within the allocated range,...

00:12.909 --> 00:16.469
...and since they're the training company of choice, I think it's a no-brainer.

00:16.805 --> 00:17.357
Excellent!

00:18.237 --> 00:20.303
How long is each of these courses?

00:20.560 --> 00:21.343
They're two hours each.

00:22.650 --> 00:27.058
OK, so if we decide to move forward with this curriculum,...

00:27.251 --> 00:31.105
...the question then becomes what is the best way for us to deliver?

00:31.218 --> 00:37.391
Should we offer them one at a time, or say, a whole day of training to attend all three?

00:37.709 --> 00:39.729
Well, from a director level perspective,...

00:39.815 --> 00:43.727
...that's really difficult to release my people for a whole entire day.

00:44.051 --> 00:46.887
It's really hard to go to training for just a few hours...

00:46.988 --> 00:51.149
...and then be expected to retain any of it when you have to go right back to work.

00:51.731 --> 00:53.077
In that sense, I do agree.

00:53.319 --> 00:56.499
I think it might be best to separate supervisors from the workplace...

00:56.609 --> 00:58.482
...so they can really focus on skills development.

00:59.469 --> 01:03.908
Plus, I can see that improving morale, especially if you bring them someplace cool.

01:04.189 --> 01:04.819
That's true.

01:04.923 --> 01:07.430
I mean, there's no reason we couldn't do the training someplace fun,...

01:07.766 --> 01:10.830
...make it something people want to do, like have training on a boat.

01:11.147 --> 01:12.321
Or on the beach!
