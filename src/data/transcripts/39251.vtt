00:00.371 --> 00:04.563
Now, we can see that quarter three revenue fell well below predictions.

00:05.052 --> 00:06.147
We have all seen the numbers?

00:06.919 --> 00:10.243
The data shows that customer retention was a sticky area.

00:10.393 --> 00:12.135
I mean, if you follow this lineâ€¦

00:12.251 --> 00:17.405
Boo! Boo! Come on, Gibbons! Nobody can see that!

00:17.701 --> 00:19.310
You should have sent it out in advance.

00:21.629 --> 00:22.701
I can make copies.

00:22.897 --> 00:26.967
You don't know how to use the machines! You don't! You don't!

00:27.129 --> 00:29.785
And the rest of you, where is the energy?

00:29.980 --> 00:31.148
Where is the focus?

00:31.231 --> 00:33.587
Come on, let's pick up the pace, hey! C'mon! Woo!

00:33.747 --> 00:34.453
Does he work here?

00:34.580 --> 00:36.099
He's a big fan of the company.

00:36.285 --> 00:41.003
Jonesy! Take us to the next item on the agenda!

00:41.123 --> 00:44.015
Just chip it, man! You're the greatest!

00:44.587 --> 00:47.481
Right. Well, yes, we don't have a formal agenda per se.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.707
You stink, Jonesy!

00:49.835 --> 00:51.517
A foul! That's a foul!

00:51.859 --> 00:54.340
This is not how you lead a team!

00:54.649 --> 00:55.863
What kind of meeting is this?

00:55.973 --> 00:57.772
Nobody understands what it's for!

00:57.852 --> 00:59.153
No, that's not true! Of course they do.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.967
Tell him what our objective is.

01:01.079 --> 01:03.486
Well, I don't even really understand what it is we do here.

01:03.858 --> 01:05.236
You do meetings,...

01:05.605 --> 01:09.301
...long, tedious meetings that amount to nothing.

01:09.816 --> 01:13.141
I'm seeing no structure, sloppy preparation.

01:13.601 --> 01:16.745
Nobody is prepared to attack the goal!

01:17.122 --> 01:20.927
I've spent too long rooting for this company to watch it fall apart.

01:21.527 --> 01:22.833
We've had a bad first half,...

01:23.385 --> 01:24.801
...but we are still in it!

01:25.249 --> 01:27.572
I want to see hustle and efficiency!

01:28.318 --> 01:30.508
I want to see teamwork!

01:31.138 --> 01:36.659
I want this to be the greatest comeback in the history of meetings!
