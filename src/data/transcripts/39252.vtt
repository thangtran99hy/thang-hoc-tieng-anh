How would you deal with conflict between two team members?

00:03.033 --> 00:07.824
Whenever I come in to a new organization and take up a position as a supervisor,...

00:08.276 --> 00:10.491
...one of the first things I will do is sit down with the team,...

00:11.020 --> 00:13.405
...I will lay out my standards and expectations,...

00:13.757 --> 00:14.499
...and I will say to them,...

00:14.592 --> 00:18.620
..."If you encounter conflict, you should be able to resolve it yourselves initially."

00:19.043 --> 00:22.029
I would then observe what happens moving forward.

00:22.388 --> 00:25.770
And if it quickly becomes apparent that that conflict isn't getting resolved,...

00:26.111 --> 00:28.226
...then I would step in and I would resolve it.

00:28.313 --> 00:31.918
And to achieve that, I would sit down with each of the team members...

00:32.049 --> 00:33.698
...to find out what has happened.

00:33.823 --> 00:35.330
I would never jump to conclusions.

00:35.623 --> 00:38.497
I would ask them questions to get to the bottom of the situation.

00:38.866 --> 00:41.453
And I would then put a plan of action in place...

00:41.626 --> 00:44.399
...to get them to resolve it or I would make the decision for them.

00:44.777 --> 00:49.001
And again, my decision on how I want them to act within their roles...

00:49.149 --> 00:53.087
...would be based on helping the organization achieve its objectives.

00:53.321 --> 00:55.797
So, I have the confidence to deal with conflict quickly.

00:56.247 --> 00:57.813
And if the team members aren't resolving it,...

00:57.926 --> 00:59.073
...then I will certainly step in...

00:59.316 --> 01:03.505
...because  any conflict can have a negative impact on the performance of my team...

01:03.731 --> 01:05.159
...and that would not be acceptable.
