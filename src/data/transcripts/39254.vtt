Our latest attempt at the Flowerko logo design, sent back for a third time.

00:06.701 --> 00:09.871
Flowerko complained that it wasn't sexy enough.

00:11.477 --> 00:12.403
Well, I have to agree.

00:12.926 --> 00:13.827
Who signed off on this?

00:14.583 --> 00:16.711
I prefer to focus on the why rather than the who.

00:19.827 --> 00:21.309
Well, very well.

00:22.623 --> 00:25.293
Then, I'd like to recommend using the five whys.

00:28.885 --> 00:29.468
What?

00:31.711 --> 00:36.584
We start with the end result and work backwards asking "why" questions.

00:37.937 --> 00:40.220
Ah! I see what you mean.

00:41.063 --> 00:44.481
So, the end result is...

00:45.327 --> 00:47.755
Our design isn't sexy enough.

00:49.742 --> 00:50.683
Why?

00:52.456 --> 00:55.595
It seems to me that's because the designers didn't make it sexy.

00:56.218 --> 00:56.802
Why not?

00:57.310 --> 00:58.943
If I can just say something.

00:59.435 --> 01:02.821
There were lots of requirements and this one wasn't made clear.

01:04.838 --> 01:08.658
Actually, the truth is the designers weren't involved in the initial meeting.

01:08.972 --> 01:09.643
Why not?

01:10.521 --> 01:11.979
There were no designers available.

01:12.493 --> 01:13.567
They were all too busy.

01:15.563 --> 01:16.621
Why do you think that was?

01:22.296 --> 01:23.814
If I can jump in here...

01:23.909 --> 01:27.574
I've noticed that most of our designers are involved in our biggest contract.

01:28.385 --> 01:31.379
This means the designers don't have much time for other projects.

01:34.381 --> 01:36.025
It sounds like you're onto something, Kelly.

01:36.528 --> 01:38.893
Can you take that a bit further?

01:40.116 --> 01:42.655
Yeah, I've just noticed that when you work,...

01:42.780 --> 01:46.177
...you have to spend most of your time working with the big contracts.
