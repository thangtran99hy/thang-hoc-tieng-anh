00:18.056 --> 00:18.749
You okay?

00:20.577 --> 00:21.456
You need a minute?

00:22.755 --> 00:25.275
Cool. Okay.

00:31.281 --> 00:35.163
Listen up people, I know a thing or two about extinction.

00:35.973 --> 00:39.669
And let me tell you, and you'd kind of think this would be obvious.

00:40.733 --> 00:43.098
Going extinct is a bad thing...

00:44.143 --> 00:47.831
...and driving yourselves extinct in 70 million years,...

00:47.991 --> 00:50.170
...that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

00:51.075 --> 00:52.725
At least we had an asteroid.

00:53.331 --> 00:54.364
What's your excuse?

00:55.258 --> 00:57.019
You're headed for a climate disaster...

00:57.229 --> 01:01.001
...and yet, every year, governments spend hundreds of billions of public funds...

01:01.241 --> 01:03.119
...on fossil fuel subsidies.

01:03.981 --> 01:08.452
Imagine if we had spent hundreds of billions per year subsidizing giant meteors.

01:08.915 --> 01:10.611
That's what you're doing right now.

01:11.721 --> 01:14.613
Think of all the other things you could do with that money.

01:15.203 --> 01:17.661
Around the world, people are living in poverty.

01:18.226 --> 01:21.247
Don't you think helping them would make more sense than, I don't know,...

01:21.619 --> 01:24.355
...paying for the demise of your entire species?

01:25.605 --> 01:27.227
Let me be real for a second.

01:27.805 --> 01:29.673
You've got a huge opportunity right now.

01:30.005 --> 01:33.731
As you rebuild your economies and bounce back from this pandemic,...

01:34.019 --> 01:35.703
...this is humanity's big chance.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.881
So, here's my wild idea.

01:40.207 --> 01:41.674
Don't choose extinction.

01:42.065 --> 01:44.554
Save your species before it's too late.

01:45.559 --> 01:49.967
It's time for you humans to stop making excuses and start making changes.

01:50.837 --> 01:51.530
Thank you.
