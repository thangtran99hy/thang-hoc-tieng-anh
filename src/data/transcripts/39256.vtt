00:01.012 --> 00:02.979
Thank you for coming in today.

00:03.455 --> 00:08.411
We appreciate you're taking the time to interview with us for a position with our firm...

00:09.011 --> 00:11.228
...and I hope it's a good experience for both of us.

00:11.825 --> 00:15.640
Let me just take a few seconds and explain how this will flow.

00:16.656 --> 00:21.450
My job, if you will, is to learn as much about you as I can...

00:21.529 --> 00:23.126
...and in a fairly short period of time.

00:23.846 --> 00:27.346
That will mean that you'll have to do most of the talking...

00:27.455 --> 00:31.280
...and hopefully we can guide through that in a way that touches on things...

00:31.369 --> 00:33.183
...that you think are really important.

00:34.138 --> 00:37.274
While we're talking, I should add that I might make a few notes...

00:37.362 --> 00:39.069
...and I hope that won't be distracting,...

00:39.176 --> 00:44.470
...but it will help me and the rest of us who discuss candidates later on...

00:44.787 --> 00:47.543
...since we interview so many people in any given day.
