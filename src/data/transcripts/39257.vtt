Chris, can you tell me about a challenge or a conflict that you've faced in the workplace...

00:05.362 --> 00:06.685
...and how you would deal with it?

00:07.071 --> 00:12.101
Sure. Prior to teaching, I was involved with a photography company,...

00:12.246 --> 00:15.193
...photographing events like weddings and bar mitzvahs...

00:15.283 --> 00:17.956
...and very, very important events in people's lives.

00:18.053 --> 00:19.551
And a lot of times, conflicts would arise.

00:20.026 --> 00:24.058
So, again, just like in teaching, overcoming those conflicts with patience...

00:24.227 --> 00:28.016
...and listening to the client or customers' needs is very important.

00:28.604 --> 00:34.065
Now, you are interviewing for a position that is not an entry-level position...

00:34.212 --> 00:38.113
...and there is the possibility that those in our company...

00:38.198 --> 00:40.799
...that were overlooked for this position may have some animosity...

00:41.607 --> 00:43.720
...regarding the new hire for this position.

00:43.821 --> 00:47.766
So, how do you approach this potential challenge here at the workplace?

00:48.191 --> 00:51.089
The important thing is to listen to the people around me...

00:51.301 --> 00:52.682
...and understand that I am a newcomer...

00:52.923 --> 00:56.867
...and that they know more about the work environment than I will coming in.

00:58.295 --> 01:02.619
We here at REI, you know, it is being in customer service,...

01:02.739 --> 01:06.269
...there are aspects of your job that are going to be a little less active...

01:06.359 --> 01:10.034
...than I could expect you being in a teaching position...

01:10.129 --> 01:14.970
...where I assume you're on your feet, more one-on-one, face-to-face with individuals.

01:16.549 --> 01:19.476
Do you prefer a specific type of work environment?

01:19.763 --> 01:24.171
Do you thrive in a variety of work environments and what does this look like?

01:24.534 --> 01:26.484
Well, I thrive in a variety of work environments.

01:26.579 --> 01:29.542
I wouldn't expect to be sitting in a cubicle, interacting with customers,...

01:29.619 --> 01:32.316
...unless I'm handling a phone call and that's fine, that's part of the job.
