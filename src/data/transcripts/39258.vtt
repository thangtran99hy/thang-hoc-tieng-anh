After a presentation that includes your prices, you may expect to hear this objection:...

00:04.300 --> 00:05.363
"It's too expensive."

00:05.798 --> 00:06.966
And often, they'll be right,...

00:07.254 --> 00:08.714
...but this whole script is based on the fact...

00:08.857 --> 00:11.408
...that you want to steer the focus away from the price of the solution,...

00:11.795 --> 00:15.792
...and instead towards the budget they intend to spend, earlier in the process.

00:16.219 --> 00:20.069
Now, before we get into this, I just wanted to discuss what resources you had in mind...

00:20.155 --> 00:24.534
...to address your needs knowing that our solutions usually run from X to Y.

00:24.851 --> 00:26.371
That will be too expensive for us.

00:26.697 --> 00:29.225
The point here is to understand what this really means.

00:29.536 --> 00:33.437
It could mean that it's too expensive compared to what they were thinking of spending...

00:34.159 --> 00:37.393
...or it's too expensive compared to other solutions out there,...

00:37.475 --> 00:39.479
...which offer the same amount of value...

00:39.658 --> 00:43.873
...or that, for such a price, they've seen solutions which will offer them more value.

00:44.541 --> 00:44.935
I get it.

00:45.124 --> 00:47.251
The fact is, though, that we usually see that people...

00:47.341 --> 00:49.119
...mean different things when they say that.

00:49.348 --> 00:51.751
Compared to what do you see this as too expensive?

00:52.473 --> 00:53.659
To what I planned to spend.

00:53.967 --> 00:56.245
Okay, what were you planning on spending?

00:56.591 --> 01:00.929
Well, we were thinking of staying within X and Y amount, ideally.

01:01.157 --> 01:04.585
Based on what you've heard, and what you know about your own solution,...

01:04.734 --> 01:07.698
...it's now important for you to choose the path forward.

01:07.957 --> 01:08.583
You may want to:...

01:08.693 --> 01:11.812
Sell them on the value of the budget that is higher than the range that they are thinking.

01:12.417 --> 01:16.020
You may want to propose a narrower scope of solution that fits within their budget...

01:16.527 --> 01:17.927
...or you may want to pause...

01:18.049 --> 01:21.226
...and allow the prospect to feel that you can't see how you would reach a solution...

01:21.321 --> 01:22.202
...in that price range.

01:22.393 --> 01:24.886
Assuming that you have the need that you described to me...

01:24.968 --> 01:27.463
...and if you saw a solution that really helps,...

01:27.598 --> 01:30.271
...would you say that your budget range is absolutely fixed...

01:30.667 --> 01:32.177
...or is there room for flexibility?

01:32.659 --> 01:34.454
We'd like to stay in that range, if possible.

01:35.273 --> 01:36.871
If you want to stay in that range,...

01:36.985 --> 01:38.741
...would you be willing to discuss a solution...

01:38.839 --> 01:42.587
...that requires narrowing the scope of your needs in order to meet your budget?

01:43.371 --> 01:47.435
Now, you have an opportunity to discover which of their needs are of highest priority,...

01:47.715 --> 01:50.079
...and which can be sacrificed to reach the budget.
