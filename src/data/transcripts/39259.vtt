Hello everyone.

00:01.745 --> 00:03.279
It began early in the season...

00:03.609 --> 00:08.098
...when Shohei Ohtani started doing things baseball hadn't seen in a century.

00:08.710 --> 00:13.060
What was evident throughout the entire 2021 MLB season...

00:13.155 --> 00:15.071
...was entered the record books Thursday.

00:15.877 --> 00:21.615
Ohtani received all 30 1st place votes from the Baseball Writers Association of America.

00:22.156 --> 00:25.721
Ohtani became the 5th Los Angeles Angels best player...

00:25.815 --> 00:30.667
...to win officially the American Leagues MVP award for the first time since 2000,...

00:30.853 --> 00:38.725
...joining Mike Trout, 2014; Albert, 2009; and Barry Bonds, 2002, and Bryce Harper.

00:39.433 --> 00:45.513
Following Angels' two-way star, Shohei Ohtani wins American League MVP award in a unanimous vote.
