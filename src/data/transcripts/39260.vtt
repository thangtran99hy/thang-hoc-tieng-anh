00:11.059 --> 00:13.237
Yes, a child!

00:14.300 --> 00:17.260
I'd like to talk about this seven-dollar blender.

00:17.665 --> 00:18.463
I'll give you four.

00:18.813 --> 00:22.139
Well, since you're wearing olive green, my favorite color,...

00:22.766 --> 00:25.010
...okay, 4 dollars for the blender, please.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.064
Oh, shucks.

00:27.269 --> 00:28.622
But, I only have three.

00:29.453 --> 00:31.551
Tell you what, I'll give you three for it...

00:31.667 --> 00:34.521
...and I'll pretend I didn't notice the calcium stains in the pitcher.

00:34.857 --> 00:35.911
You're scaring me.

00:36.239 --> 00:38.216
I'm gonna have to check with my dad.

00:39.291 --> 00:43.572
My Aunt Judy, who recently passed away, had this exact same vacuum.

00:43.693 --> 00:45.428
I know she would have wanted me to have it,...

00:45.575 --> 00:47.393
...offered to me at a lower price.

00:47.515 --> 00:49.684
It's just who my Aunt Judy was.

00:49.983 --> 00:52.616
Okay, okay, I'll let you have it for 15.

00:52.821 --> 00:54.033
Oh, thank you.

00:54.425 --> 00:55.098
Thank you.

01:04.345 --> 01:06.967
My dad says you don't look like you're worth the hassle.

01:07.201 --> 01:08.350
Three dollars is fine.

01:08.483 --> 01:10.443
Your dad is a smart man.
