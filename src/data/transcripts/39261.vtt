00:30.211 --> 00:32.019
Hello! I'm Helix 900.

00:32.231 --> 00:34.200
I am programmed to translate any language,...

00:34.377 --> 00:37.067
...read any document in under 1.4 milliseconds...

00:37.293 --> 00:39.195
...and store up to 50 terabytes of data.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.975
Okay, great! Helix 900, everyone!

Yeah. Helix 900, what is 4,981 times 22,912?

00:57.549 --> 01:01.431
One hundred fourteen million, one hundred twenty-four thousand, six hundred seventy-two.

01:02.420 --> 01:03.361
Wow! That was fast!
