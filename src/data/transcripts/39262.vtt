Our company has a new strategic initiative to increase market penetration,...

00:04.935 --> 00:07.951
...maximize brand loyalty, and enhance intangible assets.

00:08.421 --> 00:10.307
In pursuit of these objectives,...

00:10.545 --> 00:13.851
...we've started a new project for which we require seven red lines.

00:14.259 --> 00:16.197
I understand your company can help us in this matter.

00:16.301 --> 00:16.986
Of course!

00:17.823 --> 00:20.032
Walter here will be the project manager.

00:20.705 --> 00:22.307
Walter, we can do this, can't we?

00:22.531 --> 00:23.249
Yes, of course.

00:23.796 --> 00:26.891
Anderson here is our expert in all matters related to drawing red lines.

00:27.104 --> 00:29.393
We've brought him along today to share his professional opinion.

00:29.685 --> 00:30.345
Nice to meet you!

00:30.562 --> 00:31.641
Well, you all know me.

00:32.314 --> 00:34.926
This is Justine, our company's design specialist.

00:35.264 --> 00:35.750
Hello!

00:36.289 --> 00:38.739
We need you to draw seven red lines,...

00:38.839 --> 00:40.396
...all of them strictly perpendicular.

00:40.751 --> 00:42.899
Some with green ink and some with transparent.

00:43.527 --> 00:44.338
Can you do that?

00:46.479 --> 00:47.412
I'll simplify.

00:47.569 --> 00:50.569
A line as such can be drawn with absolutely any ink,...

00:50.703 --> 00:53.301
...but if you want to get a red line, you need to use red ink.

00:54.547 --> 00:56.436
What if we draw them with blue ink?

00:56.946 --> 00:58.471
It still won't work.

00:58.649 --> 01:00.815
If you use blue ink, you will get blue lines.
