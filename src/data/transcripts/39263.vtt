As you know, the performance appraisal process...

00:02.641 --> 00:05.006
...is a very important process here at Keystone College...

00:05.377 --> 00:10.157
...because it provides us with an opportunity to talk about what's going on in your work,...

00:10.327 --> 00:13.311
...gives you a chance to tell me if you have any concerns or issues,...

00:14.017 --> 00:17.863
...and it also provides me with an opportunity to share with you...

00:17.963 --> 00:21.346
...how you are supporting the whole strategic planning process,...

00:21.811 --> 00:25.853
...the strategic goals of our department and of the college.

00:26.270 --> 00:31.476
So, with that, let's look at first your goals from last year.

00:32.570 --> 00:35.152
You did an excellent job on the department report.

00:35.261 --> 00:36.562
Thanks, I worked really hard on that.

00:36.687 --> 00:37.293
I could tell.

00:38.667 --> 00:41.865
The column headings clearly describe the material...

00:41.948 --> 00:46.400
...and the calculations in the report were all correct and in an easy-to-read format.

00:46.519 --> 00:47.159
Excellent job.

00:47.481 --> 00:51.004
And you submitted it early, so that was a bonus, too.

00:51.105 --> 00:52.056
So, that was awesome.

00:52.432 --> 00:55.911
So, moving on, let's look at the different categories here.

00:56.983 --> 01:00.091
And that you also rated in your self-evaluation form as well.

01:01.649 --> 01:07.551
For customer service here, I rated you as "meets expectations."

01:07.917 --> 01:16.522
In regard to teamwork, I have that you have done an above-average job.

01:16.848 --> 01:25.374
You had worked on a project where you filled in as the team leader.

01:25.602 --> 01:27.205
You took the team leader role...

01:27.550 --> 01:35.643
...and you actually had the department work on this major transaction goal...

01:35.983 --> 01:37.058
...and you accomplished that.

01:37.187 --> 01:45.136
And it took leadership skills and communication skills for you...

01:45.238 --> 01:49.471
...to get everybody else to cooperate and work with you and accomplish that...

01:49.561 --> 01:50.791
...and you did an excellent job with that.

01:50.877 --> 01:52.051
Thank you, I appreciate that.
