Can you tell me about a time when you suffered a setback...

00:02.955 --> 00:04.917
...and had to maintain your enthusiasm?

00:05.299 --> 00:07.726
Sure, one definitely comes to mind.

00:08.393 --> 00:13.829
Last year, a project for a new toy was in its final stages after two years of work.

00:14.019 --> 00:17.591
As we were looking at the branding and working up a final marketing plan,...

00:17.953 --> 00:21.990
...a competitor launched a version of the exact same toy that we were launching.

00:22.847 --> 00:27.628
As the leader of the project, I knew that my reaction would set the tone for the group.

00:28.369 --> 00:30.587
I acknowledged that it was a setback,...

00:30.694 --> 00:34.173
...but challenged the group to think of this as a blessing in disguise.

00:34.840 --> 00:37.886
I asked them to go out and buy the competitor's product...

00:38.026 --> 00:42.558
...and make a list of anything they wished the toy could do that it didn't.

00:42.987 --> 00:45.290
It turned out that the list was pretty long.

00:45.793 --> 00:50.666
We added these items to our toy, and launched a far superior product six months later.

00:51.166 --> 00:55.791
So, in many ways, the competitor's product became the key to our success.

00:56.733 --> 00:58.231
That sounds like a great victory.
