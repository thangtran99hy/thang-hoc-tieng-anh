Well, thank you, Susie, for taking the time to meet with me today.

00:03.876 --> 00:07.665
It really means a lot to me to be open and honest with you.

00:08.639 --> 00:10.466
Our work relationship is important to me,...

00:10.567 --> 00:13.132
...so I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me.

00:13.837 --> 00:15.425
I had something I wanted to talk to you about.

00:16.958 --> 00:21.985
Lately, I've been feeling like you haven't really been fully listening to me...

00:23.043 --> 00:29.203
...or really valuing or respecting any of my ideas or input.

00:30.611 --> 00:33.180
For example, the other day in our meeting,...

00:34.382 --> 00:40.109
...when I was right in the middle of giving an opinion on something,...

00:40.214 --> 00:44.654
...I felt like you interrupted me mid-sentence and you never really came back to me.

00:45.700 --> 00:49.984
It made me feel like my feedback or my input was not valued.

00:50.589 --> 00:53.842
It also made me feel embarrassed in front of the other people in the meeting.

00:54.393 --> 00:57.877
So, I just wanted to make you aware that that's how I felt.

00:59.237 --> 01:02.655
That's hard to hear, but I appreciate you letting me know.

01:04.533 --> 01:08.841
I'm hearing that you're feeling embarrassed...

01:08.969 --> 01:14.513
...and not valued because I've interrupted you or cut you off in meetings.

01:14.613 --> 01:16.065
I did feel a little embarrassed the other day.

01:16.640 --> 01:17.679
It didn't feel good.

01:17.801 --> 01:19.021
Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:19.176 --> 01:25.401
I have to admit this is something that I've received feedback on in the past...

01:25.507 --> 01:29.395
...and so it's something that I really know I need to work on.

01:29.715 --> 01:31.602
I really am committed to working on this...

01:31.737 --> 01:34.815
...and I'm gonna really make an effort to be more self-aware.

01:34.937 --> 01:41.244
And it would be helpful to me too if you give me some follow-up feedback...

01:41.342 --> 01:47.298
...or I can check in with you later to make sure that I am giving you what you need.
