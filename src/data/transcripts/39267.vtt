00:00.499 --> 00:06.011
We had to take this first time ever TV live performance...

00:06.309 --> 00:08.287
...at this stage, AMAs.

00:12.482 --> 00:17.223
We were like, too excited and nervous at the time...

00:17.496 --> 00:21.793
...and it's been a long and amazing ride since then,...

00:21.924 --> 00:29.573
...but nobody could have ever bet on the odds of us standing here receiving this award.

00:32.961 --> 00:36.444
Except, except y'all Army, except y'all.

00:41.982 --> 00:45.207
Seven boys from Korea, united by a love for music...

00:46.921 --> 00:51.817
...met the love and support from all the armies all over the world.

00:55.373 --> 00:56.416
This whole thing is a miracle.

00:58.629 --> 01:01.530
Seriously, we'll never take this for granted.

01:01.753 --> 01:02.959
Thank you so much.

01:03.266 --> 01:04.343
We love you all.

01:04.949 --> 01:06.854
We want to give this honor to you guys.

01:07.826 --> 01:12.694
We just wanted to make people happy with our music.

01:13.522 --> 01:20.095
We believe that this award opens the beginning of our new chapter.

01:22.637 --> 01:41.949
In the past few years, we learned that each and every moment is precious.
