What makes a person beautiful is their personality.

00:04.305 --> 00:08.335
Everybody has a personality and everybody's beautiful,...

00:08.813 --> 00:10.798
...but in a different way than other people.

00:11.693 --> 00:15.563
Well, you kind of have to be confident in yourself...

00:16.330 --> 00:17.834
...to feel like you're beautiful.

00:17.983 --> 00:19.698
Otherwise, if you don't really have confidence,...

00:19.861 --> 00:23.669
...the thought that you are beautiful kind of fades away,...

00:24.191 --> 00:26.470
...so it's kind of your job to bring it back.

00:27.151 --> 00:30.543
Well, my friend has freckles and she's like a ton of freckles...

00:30.619 --> 00:32.193
...and they're super pretty on her.

00:32.555 --> 00:34.576
And like I personally wish I had freckles...

00:34.717 --> 00:35.815
...and she'll like cover them up...

00:36.011 --> 00:40.627
...and that just shows that people have different ideas on certain things like...

00:40.865 --> 00:42.039
...she doesn't like her freckles...

00:42.133 --> 00:43.391
...when I think they look great on her...

00:43.492 --> 00:44.029
...and they're pretty.

00:44.765 --> 00:48.585
Being beautiful is learning all the lessons in life...

00:48.783 --> 00:52.965
...and then you go from here to here and you start to blossom.
