Oh, hi!

00:01.293 --> 00:05.419
I just got some new advice from this book "Flip-Flops and Microwaved Fish"...

00:05.567 --> 00:07.541
...about socializing with people at work.

00:07.929 --> 00:11.865
Recently, I've heard that a lot of teams are doing after-work cocktail hours...

00:12.072 --> 00:14.077
...where you're supposed to bring your own cocktail...

00:14.224 --> 00:16.304
...and not talk about things related to work.

00:16.587 --> 00:20.719
But, my advice for you is don't feel that you have to drink an alcoholic beverage...

00:20.807 --> 00:22.908
...or talk about anything that's personal to you...

00:23.227 --> 00:27.434
...like your alcoholic dad or your humorless, clueless ex-wife.

00:27.981 --> 00:30.533
Just feel comfortable talking about things you want to talk about...

00:30.623 --> 00:32.951
...like a new smoothie recipe.

00:44.416 --> 00:45.644
Oh man! That's awful!

00:45.735 --> 00:46.567
Who made this?
