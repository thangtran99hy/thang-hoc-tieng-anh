00:00.231 --> 00:02.267
Hey, Jack! Sorry I'm so late.

00:02.380 --> 00:04.919
You're not. I changed the clock on your phone, I just got here.

00:07.801 --> 00:10.761
Anyway, I really appreciate you coming to my neighborhood,...

00:10.858 --> 00:12.357
...my home turf, if you will.

00:17.074 --> 00:18.853
I see. Well played, Jack.

00:26.585 --> 00:31.818
You anticipated my countermove, employing a "shortness is weakness" power axiom.

00:31.982 --> 00:33.845
However, I knew then you might know...

00:33.924 --> 00:39.911
...that I knew to bring my own furniture, so I also brought my Jack Welch power pillow.

00:40.663 --> 00:41.490
I'm very sorry, sir.

00:42.693 --> 00:43.595
I thought you might do that,...

00:43.685 --> 00:47.177
...which is why I'm going to be the first person to do "power quiet talking,"...

00:47.443 --> 00:51.793
...forcing you to lean in and wonder if you're missing any key phrases, like an idiot.

00:51.893 --> 00:56.861
I thought you'd try "power quiet talking," which is why I'm wearing a hearing aid.

00:57.394 --> 00:59.465
Still me, I'm everything I hoped I'd be.

00:59.654 --> 01:00.221
Let's begin.

01:01.293 --> 01:02.821
Two percent raise, a show on Christmas,...

01:02.907 --> 01:05.625
...no gross merchandising and you have a run in your stocking.

01:05.714 --> 01:07.588
Eight percent raise, two weeks off at Christmas,...

01:07.683 --> 01:10.513
...five gross, and nice try, I'm not wearing stockings.

01:10.682 --> 01:11.270
That's a vein.

01:11.366 --> 01:12.601
No raise, no vacation,...

01:12.698 --> 01:15.507
...and from now on, you have to say "Go for Liz!" when you answer your phone.

01:16.089 --> 01:16.564
Hold on a sec.

01:17.022 --> 01:19.666
Come on, lemon! I'm just doing the Sorcerer's Apprentice.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.280
You respond with a pirate holiday...

01:21.487 --> 01:23.785
...and I have no choice but to play the hillbilly auction.

01:23.855 --> 01:24.979
It's all in the tapes.
