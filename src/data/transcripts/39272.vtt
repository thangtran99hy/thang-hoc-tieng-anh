If you were the product manager for WhatsApp, how would you improve WhatsApp?

00:05.957 --> 00:06.319
Got it.

00:07.165 --> 00:10.046
Before we go ahead, I have a few clarifying questions I'd like to ask.

00:10.220 --> 00:13.826
Number one, are there any specific goals we're thinking about...

00:13.917 --> 00:15.319
...when it comes to improving WhatsApp?

00:15.413 --> 00:17.589
Like, are we thinking about improving user acquisition,...

00:17.666 --> 00:21.571
...user engagement, monetization, or is that something you'd like to be defined?

00:22.571 --> 00:23.731
I would like you to define it.

00:24.177 --> 00:27.657
But if I have to lean somewhere with the opportunities that you listed...

00:27.713 --> 00:30.327
I would say that monetization is not one of our current goals right now...

00:30.430 --> 00:33.624
We're still in the phase of growing and getting user engagement.

00:34.435 --> 00:34.832
Got it.

00:36.047 --> 00:38.465
The second question I had was...

00:38.695 --> 00:42.322
...is there any specific customer segment that we're interested in targeting...

00:42.488 --> 00:45.540
...or is that something you'd like for me to define as well?

00:46.951 --> 00:50.841
I would like you to define the target segment for improving WhatsApp.

00:51.430 --> 00:56.348
WhatsApp is obviously, clearly a very global company in product.

00:56.715 --> 00:59.185
So, I would like to see maybe how you think about it...

00:59.275 --> 01:01.435
...and I'm happy to nudge you in the right direction throughout the interview.

01:01.715 --> 01:04.209
And we're going ahead with picking the elderly segment.

01:04.331 --> 01:06.627
We're focusing on specifically that segment.

01:06.769 --> 01:09.801
That customer segment in terms of how we're going to think about improving WhatsApp.

01:11.229 --> 01:12.328
Cool, sounds great.

01:12.523 --> 01:17.601
Yeah, let's dive a little bit deeper into the elderly population segment.

01:18.799 --> 01:23.455
I'd love for you to also kind of tell me a little bit more about some ideas you have...

01:23.523 --> 01:24.724
...and the product vision that you have around...

01:24.810 --> 01:30.249
...how we would improve it, or what is the vision of this improvement?

01:30.338 --> 01:34.216
Is it a feature, you know, regardless of whether or not it's a feature or a product,...

01:34.315 --> 01:37.009
...I'd like to just see kind of your vision, thinking here.

01:37.987 --> 01:40.841
I want to get into the product itself in this...

01:40.953 --> 01:43.137
...this conversational system that you're suggesting...

01:43.349 --> 01:45.757
...and I want to kind of hammer out like what that actually looks like.

01:46.137 --> 01:47.968
Can you take us through maybe a user journey...

01:48.055 --> 01:50.889
â€¦of what using that conversational assistant might look like?

01:51.410 --> 01:52.299
Yeah, for sure.
