Good morning, Transnational Hotel, New York.

00:05.940 --> 00:06.667
How may I help you?

00:06.978 --> 00:08.542
Good morning, this is Tom Sanders.

00:08.629 --> 00:11.892
I'm calling about the special rate for the members of the Global Travel Club.

00:12.243 --> 00:13.956
Does that apply during the holiday season?

00:14.608 --> 00:15.723
It certainly does.

00:15.922 --> 00:20.118
However, please be aware that rooms can only be booked four weeks in advance.

00:20.658 --> 00:21.451
Oh, that's fine.

00:21.770 --> 00:23.962
I just had a couple of questions I'd like to ask before booking.

00:24.216 --> 00:25.789
Of course, what would you like to know?

00:26.267 --> 00:28.149
Actually, yes, I was hoping to unwind a little.

00:28.240 --> 00:29.739
Do you have a spa or gym?

00:30.003 --> 00:30.997
Yes, we do.

00:31.083 --> 00:35.361
We have a 24-hour wellness center with stationary bikes, weight machines,...

00:35.433 --> 00:37.056
...elliptical trainers and treadmills.

00:37.499 --> 00:41.943
We also have a swimming pool and a sauna, which are open from 6:00 a.m. until midnight.

00:42.496 --> 00:45.604
You can find photos and additional information on our hotel website.

00:46.163 --> 00:47.095
Oh, that sounds great.

00:47.579 --> 00:52.018
We also have a hotel spa where you can book massages and various treatments.

00:52.587 --> 00:53.869
Is there a restaurant in the hotel?

00:54.269 --> 00:55.125
There sure is.

00:55.213 --> 01:00.117
Our five-star restaurant opens for breakfast and stays open until the last guest leaves.

01:00.525 --> 01:03.973
There is also a hotel bar, which is open from 5:00 p.m. onwards.

01:04.493 --> 01:06.469
Great, how about internet access?

01:06.740 --> 01:09.254
You can access our wireless connection in your room.

01:09.491 --> 01:12.444
If you don't have a computer with you, you can use our office center,...

01:12.768 --> 01:16.433
...which is equipped with computers, printers and fax and copy machines.

01:17.799 --> 01:18.756
That sounds terrific.

01:18.901 --> 01:21.143
One last question: do you have a conference room?

01:21.536 --> 01:22.425
Yes, we do.

01:22.569 --> 01:25.367
It seats about 50 people.

01:26.567 --> 01:30.447
Fantastic, I just have to double-check my dates before I book my stay.

01:30.848 --> 01:31.727
Wonderful.
