00:00.274 --> 00:01.497
Well, I have everything I need,...

00:01.615 --> 00:05.497
...but do you have any questions for me about the company or the position?

00:06.249 --> 00:11.586
Yes. Imagine you're looking back on this hiring decision in a year.

00:12.324 --> 00:15.808
The person you hired has exceeded your expectations.

00:16.144 --> 00:19.118
What did he or she do that impressed you the most?

00:20.602 --> 00:21.573
That's a great question.

00:22.754 --> 00:25.251
I think in one year the person would have come in...

00:25.380 --> 00:28.859
...and spent some time learning from the team and people that have been here a while.

00:29.635 --> 00:34.291
Then, she or he will begin making changes in an informed way.

00:35.045 --> 00:38.803
In one year, I want this person's team to be a well-oiled machine.

00:39.207 --> 00:41.449
I want them to be bouncing ideas off each other,...

00:41.655 --> 00:44.949
...coming up with new designs, and making headway into new markets.

00:45.899 --> 00:46.685
That's helpful.

00:47.205 --> 00:49.321
It's good to know what the expectations are.
