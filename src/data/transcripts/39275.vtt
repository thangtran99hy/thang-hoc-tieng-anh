Jason, just before we get started,...

00:02.084 --> 00:05.170
...I wanted to let you know that the idea you came up with last week was very good...

00:05.983 --> 00:07.204
...and I've given it to Alex to implement.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.252
So, well done and thank you.

00:09.729 --> 00:10.397
Serious?

00:11.832 --> 00:12.639
That's brilliant.

00:14.057 --> 00:16.240
So, now to today's performance appraisal...

00:16.806 --> 00:19.177
...it's a lot more structured than the ones we've been doing monthly...

00:19.255 --> 00:20.919
...with a lot more paperwork.

00:22.044 --> 00:23.886
It will be fair to say there are no surprises here.

00:24.155 --> 00:26.314
I've let you know regularly what you've been doing well...

00:26.529 --> 00:28.236
...and also the areas in which you could improve.

00:28.659 --> 00:29.321
Would you agree?

00:30.018 --> 00:30.669
Absolutely.

00:31.976 --> 00:34.292
You've lifted your performance a lot since last year...

00:34.385 --> 00:36.627
...and you've done very well to achieve the goals that we set.

00:37.190 --> 00:37.836
And another thing,...

00:37.924 --> 00:40.379
...I wanted to let you know that I appreciate how you've kept me informed...

00:40.746 --> 00:43.813
...how you've let me know both the good and the bad about how we've been doing.

00:45.198 --> 00:46.819
Now, as you can see,...

00:47.135 --> 00:50.863
...next to each category rating, I've written the evidence on which I base the rating.

00:51.279 --> 00:54.789
Have a read and if there's anything you don't agree with, let me know either now or later.

00:56.479 --> 01:00.826
Actually, there is something here in the written communications category.

01:01.443 --> 01:03.363
You said you haven't seen much to support this.

01:03.977 --> 01:08.070
What about that report I wrote a couple of months ago on improving customer relations?

01:08.161 --> 01:10.119
Wouldn't that account for this?

01:10.729 --> 01:11.937
Oh, was that you?

01:12.444 --> 01:12.749
Yeah.

01:13.362 --> 01:14.707
Oh, I completely forgot.

01:14.782 --> 01:17.038
My apologies, I thought that was Alan.

01:17.407 --> 01:19.471
And back then, I really didn't know who was who.

01:20.569 --> 01:24.263
It was a fabulous report, and yes, it would change your performance rating.

01:24.794 --> 01:27.685
My mistake completely, but thanks for bringing that to my attention.

01:27.969 --> 01:31.015
It was a good example of assertive, nonaggressive communication.

01:31.695 --> 01:34.711
It's a lot easier to work with people when they're calm and assertive.

01:36.210 --> 01:36.558
Cool.
