00:00.511 --> 00:01.556
All right, interviews.

00:01.635 --> 00:02.767
Got lots of good candidates.

00:02.942 --> 00:03.673
Let's dive right in.

00:06.691 --> 00:09.090
I think you might have actually just muted yourself right there.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.676
A little about myself...

00:12.780 --> 00:13.847
...really driven.

00:14.727 --> 00:17.165
Hey, sorry, Tim. I think you might be having some webcam issues.

00:18.533 --> 00:19.477
Kind of looks like you're whistling.

00:22.187 --> 00:24.293
Now it seems like you're going backwards; that's the first time I've seen that.

00:26.039 --> 00:28.122
Sounds like you're speaking in tongues and everything's gotten really dark.

00:28.341 --> 00:30.157
I like to think of myself as a passionate...

00:30.253 --> 00:30.727
Never mind.

00:31.272 --> 00:32.891
So, Jen, why do you want to work for this company?

00:33.043 --> 00:36.675
I would be thrilled to work with you. Hey! No, dear, can you stop right now?

00:37.696 --> 00:39.811
I need to do this interview so I can pay for your food.

00:40.101 --> 00:41.099
Oh, so cute.

00:41.235 --> 00:43.134
So, Tim, what would you say is your biggest strength?

00:43.569 --> 00:49.681
People say that I'm too organized at times and I can see where they get it.

00:49.771 --> 00:51.881
I mean, I consider myself a neat freak.

00:52.567 --> 00:52.980
For sure.

00:56.363 --> 00:58.173
Hey, do you mind moving a little closer to the camera?

01:00.602 --> 01:02.185
Just a little closer, I can't see.

01:02.278 --> 01:02.780
Is this better?

01:03.452 --> 01:04.909
Yeah, that's better,...

01:06.584 --> 01:08.479
...but now I kind of see the bottom of your chin.

01:10.076 --> 01:11.624
Now I'm just kind of seeing the tippy top of your head.

01:13.801 --> 01:14.493
Hey, where's he going?

01:17.517 --> 01:18.533
I guess we're going on a journey.

01:19.115 --> 01:22.130
So, Katie, how would you say you stay calm in stressful situations?

01:22.509 --> 01:23.280
Great question.

01:23.400 --> 01:29.454
How I stay calm in stressful...

01:29.562 --> 01:30.455
One second.
