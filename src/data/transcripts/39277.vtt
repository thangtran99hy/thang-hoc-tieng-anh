Here's how I would close if I was delivering a  talk to university students...

00:04.608 --> 00:07.261
...about discovering their talents and strengths.

00:07.483 --> 00:11.412
For some of you, this may be the last time we see each other.

00:12.632 --> 00:20.171
But before we part ways, I need to remind you that we all have superpowers.

00:20.931 --> 00:25.177
You deserve to be successful and to express all of your hidden talents.

00:25.815 --> 00:26.955
I believe in you.

00:28.035 --> 00:30.721
In closing, I have one ask.

00:31.682 --> 00:32.841
Don't give up on yourself.

00:33.989 --> 00:37.632
Look inside yourself and I promise that you will find it.

00:39.110 --> 00:43.198
It might not happen straightaway, but keep searching.

00:43.654 --> 00:46.831
Keep looking and you will find your gift.

00:47.718 --> 00:50.121
I want to say a massive "Thank you" to Allie King.

00:50.253 --> 00:52.670
Thank you so much for putting this event together.

00:53.031 --> 00:55.980
None of this would have been possible if it wasn't for her.

00:56.609 --> 00:58.335
Thank you so much for having me.

00:58.546 --> 01:00.662
Thank you so much for showing up.

01:00.799 --> 01:03.945
I enjoyed each and every second  we had together.

01:05.109 --> 01:09.264
Have an amazing day and I'll see you on the next one.
