What can you tell me about some of your goals over the next few years?

00:03.949 --> 00:06.372
My primary goal is to gain more work experience,...

00:06.897 --> 00:08.829
...so, a position like this would help me meet that goal.

00:09.595 --> 00:12.563
I'd also like to learn more about the different aspects of banking.

00:12.849 --> 00:14.995
I think those goals are very smart.

00:15.496 --> 00:19.063
I also want to ask you what salary range you'd be most comfortable with?

00:19.411 --> 00:24.187
I would be hoping to start somewhere between 35,000 and 38,000 dollars a year,...

00:24.967 --> 00:27.493
...which is based on my experience and education.

00:28.307 --> 00:28.750
Thank you.

00:29.375 --> 00:31.193
Those are all the questions I have for you today.

00:31.695 --> 00:33.152
Do you have any questions for me?

00:33.821 --> 00:35.431
Can you tell me about the working hours?

00:35.925 --> 00:39.396
We'd like whoever fills the position to work nine to five each weekday.

00:39.921 --> 00:41.675
There may be some occasional overtime.

00:42.083 --> 00:42.475
Alright.

00:42.999 --> 00:43.529
Thank you.

00:44.214 --> 00:46.351
And when do you expect to be making your decision?

00:46.895 --> 00:49.510
We'll give you a call within a week and let you know.

00:49.921 --> 00:51.107
Do you have any other questions?

00:51.630 --> 00:53.177
Not at the moment, thank you.

00:53.490 --> 00:56.198
Well, if you think of any more, you're always welcome to call me.

00:56.561 --> 00:57.362
Thank you so much.

00:57.565 --> 00:58.874
It was great to meet you.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.397
Thanks for coming in today.

01:00.598 --> 01:00.931
Thank you.

01:01.243 --> 01:02.489
It was a pleasure meeting you as well.
