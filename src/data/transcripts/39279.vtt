So, let me ask you.

00:02.021 --> 00:05.533
You probably go through great pains to prevent Mr. Pickles and Gabriella from dying, if I'm not mistaken.

00:05.895 --> 00:06.276
Well...

00:06.384 --> 00:06.578
Yes.

00:06.663 --> 00:06.862
Right.

00:07.183 --> 00:09.159
Is this what you normally clean your house with?

00:09.512 --> 00:11.693
It's whatever on sale, it's usually blue or yellow?

00:11.770 --> 00:12.424
That would be correct.

00:12.518 --> 00:12.736
Yes.

00:13.209 --> 00:14.228
Well, here's a problem with that.

00:14.603 --> 00:16.694
It's extremely poisonous...

00:16.952 --> 00:18.098
...and it's really dangerous...

00:18.376 --> 00:21.244
...and I can show you statistics and experiments...

00:21.337 --> 00:24.845
...that prove that my product doesn't only clean better than those, but it's safer.

00:25.239 --> 00:27.777
But if I've shown you one thing is that, that is really boring.

00:28.163 --> 00:30.582
So, instead, I'll just do this.

00:33.605 --> 00:34.491
Experiment.

00:44.428 --> 00:45.216
I'm impressed.

00:45.405 --> 00:46.019
I am.

00:48.449 --> 00:52.285
ScieoClean is the best cleaning product that's ever been invented.

00:52.523 --> 00:53.609
It's completely natural.

00:53.682 --> 00:54.539
It's completely safe...

00:54.645 --> 00:56.762
...and it cleans better that any product on the market.

00:56.829 --> 00:59.681
If any of my competitors are making the same claim,...

00:59.983 --> 01:02.775
...all I say is come on TV and drink your product.

01:03.045 --> 01:04.237
But I don't think you will.
