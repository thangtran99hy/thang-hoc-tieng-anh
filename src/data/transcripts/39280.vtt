Oh, Emma. Look, we're really happy with how you've been performing thus far...

00:04.074 --> 00:06.377
...and you've definitely stepped up from last month.

00:06.653 --> 00:11.652
I think you were seen an orange, but I think we should move that up to green, you deserve it.

00:11.791 --> 00:12.939
Great. Thank you.

00:13.092 --> 00:15.288
Emma, we're really happy with how you've been meeting your objectives.

00:15.633 --> 00:18.817
It's aligning perfectly with the organizational values.

00:19.043 --> 00:20.188
You're a team worker.

00:20.739 --> 00:21.329
You're honest.

00:21.521 --> 00:22.807
You're quite excellent at what you're doing.

00:22.925 --> 00:25.260
So, thus far we're really happy with how you've been.

00:25.390 --> 00:28.387
Do you have any questions for where we're headed...

00:28.517 --> 00:30.288
...and the role that you've been doing so far?

00:30.413 --> 00:31.562
No, not at the moment.

00:31.652 --> 00:35.705
I mean, I keep it up to date with my notes on there, about the thing that I'm doing...

00:35.821 --> 00:38.627
...and obviously, I can see your replies on the system anyway.

00:38.726 --> 00:42.830
So, everything that I need to know month by month is pretty much there already.

00:43.035 --> 00:45.121
I want to also discuss your development plan...

00:45.215 --> 00:48.721
...and how you think you're traveling with that so far.

00:49.234 --> 00:54.089
In regard to other skills, other areas that you like to learn more about,...

00:54.218 --> 00:55.562
...can you tell me anything about that?

00:56.119 --> 00:59.106
If I'm honest, I'd quite like to be a bit better on Excel...

00:59.189 --> 01:02.049
...so if you've got any courses on that, that'd be really helpful to me.

01:02.610 --> 01:05.619
Emma, we really want to focus on your career progression here at the company...

01:05.923 --> 01:08.639
...so, any way we can help your work, we're more than happy to do so.
