00:00.050 --> 00:03.193
Can you believe it's only been six months since your last performance review?

00:03.597 --> 00:04.173
Wow!

00:04.599 --> 00:05.315
Where to begin?

00:05.391 --> 00:06.787
I guess, let's start at the top.

00:06.949 --> 00:07.910
Your hair is disgusting.

00:08.085 --> 00:10.111
Everybody can tell you're using a shampoo conditioner combo.

00:10.209 --> 00:12.841
Moving down the skull, you're starting to get bags under your eyes like Jake,...

00:12.948 --> 00:14.751
...and it's making it harder to tell you apart.

00:14.924 --> 00:17.201
On a positive note, you are not a fraud,...

00:17.318 --> 00:19.263
...but that's only because you failed to fool anyone...

00:19.353 --> 00:21.240
...into thinking you are remotely competent.

00:21.871 --> 00:26.387
Your knees are knobby as all hell, just two big, horrifying knobs.

00:26.528 --> 00:29.063
I'd turn them, but I'm afraid what lurks behind those doors.

00:29.145 --> 00:31.862
I'll skip your splinty shins for now, but we both know your toes are weird.

00:32.045 --> 00:33.222
And last but not least,...

00:33.324 --> 00:37.454
...we know from our screen monitoring program you've been watching movies at work.

00:37.989 --> 00:40.057
And you have terrible taste.

00:40.299 --> 00:45.481
In summation, your job is hanging by a thread, and you're living in a scissors factory.

00:46.977 --> 00:52.438
Well, John, some of those adjectives will haunt me for the rest of my life.

00:52.675 --> 00:52.849
Right.

00:52.987 --> 00:57.519
You clearly put a lot of thought into that, so good job.

01:00.919 --> 01:07.494
Sorry, you're telling me that I did a good job on your performance review?

01:10.355 --> 01:11.048
Yeah?

01:13.520 --> 01:16.194
Great. Thank you, Matt.

01:17.150 --> 01:18.319
I did do a good job.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.591
And hey, all that stuff about your job hanging by a thread,...

01:22.785 --> 01:24.493
...you know I'm just trying to motivate you, right?

01:24.787 --> 01:26.570
I mean, if the lion tamer doesn't crack the whip,...

01:26.739 --> 01:28.483
...the lions start thinking he doesn't have a whip.

01:28.923 --> 01:29.508
You catch my drift?

01:29.815 --> 01:32.255
I don't know if you've ever seen lions turn on their master,...

01:32.366 --> 01:35.164
...but there's a reason that I'd stopped watching lion videos.

01:35.634 --> 01:37.565
That's a really effective analogy, John.

01:38.295 --> 01:38.808
Good job.

01:39.900 --> 01:40.291
Great.
