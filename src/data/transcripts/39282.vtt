WEBVTT

00:01.548 --> 00:04.581
And, we offer full benefits and three weeks paid vacation.

00:04.763 --> 00:04.947
Oh!

00:05.192 --> 00:06.171
Three weeks, wow!

00:06.423 --> 00:06.654
Yeah.

00:06.968 --> 00:08.267
I'm not going to lie to you, Kurt,...

00:08.381 --> 00:10.122
...you're very high on our list...

00:10.317 --> 00:13.050
...and we want you to work here very much.

00:13.563 --> 00:14.432
So, what do you think?

00:14.951 --> 00:17.033
I think I want the job.

00:17.687 --> 00:18.223
Fantastic!

00:18.334 --> 00:19.079
Oh, excellent.

00:19.239 --> 00:19.481
Great.

00:19.726 --> 00:24.231
So, we'll give you a pass key, and assign you a desk and a parking space.

00:24.879 --> 00:25.382
Excuse me,...

00:25.491 --> 00:26.263
...Mr. Tarkanian.

00:26.485 --> 00:27.419
Why are you interrupting me?

00:27.580 --> 00:28.683
Yes, Mr. Tarkanian.

00:32.595 --> 00:38.066
So, you should probably go to personnel and get started on your paperwork.
