Hi, Nora.

00:01.815 --> 00:02.048
Hi.

00:02.454 --> 00:04.493
Thank you for meeting me on such short notice about Abby.

00:04.693 --> 00:05.109
Sure.

00:05.449 --> 00:06.711
Come on in. Have a seat.

00:06.887 --> 00:08.165
Abby, Abby.

00:08.523 --> 00:09.271
We miss Abby.

00:09.899 --> 00:11.107
I haven't talked to her for a while.

00:11.195 --> 00:11.731
Is everything okay?

00:12.343 --> 00:13.225
Not really.

00:13.375 --> 00:14.535
She seems to be struggling.

00:14.744 --> 00:17.613
Lateness and attendance issues.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.380
Did she have any trouble getting to work when she was on your team?

00:21.167 --> 00:23.885
Not once we worked out the telework system.

00:24.859 --> 00:26.092
Abby is a good worker.

00:26.518 --> 00:26.903
Period.

00:27.306 --> 00:31.483
But, she has health issues that she has to manage, and she needs flexibility.

00:31.751 --> 00:35.295
We worked at a schedule where she could see her psychotherapist regularly...

00:35.868 --> 00:38.177
...and then work the hours where she was feeling best,...

00:38.808 --> 00:40.496
...even sometimes if it was late at night.

00:41.556 --> 00:43.839
Sometimes, the meds she's on...

00:44.680 --> 00:46.824
...have side effects that just make it difficult for her.

00:47.213 --> 00:47.494
Okay.

00:47.645 --> 00:52.656
So, she's a person with a disability and you provided flexibility as an accommodation?

00:52.837 --> 00:53.243
Yes.

00:53.849 --> 00:56.417
Did that present issues to other members of your team?

00:57.061 --> 00:58.298
No, not really.

00:58.673 --> 01:02.151
I have working parents, people going back to school...

01:02.255 --> 01:08.049
...and any number of other reasons why my team members request flexible work arrangements.

01:08.733 --> 01:09.192
No biggie.

01:09.937 --> 01:10.473
Got it.

01:10.927 --> 01:13.763
Yeah, I just don't think that her new supervisor...

01:13.877 --> 01:16.137
...is as comfortable with flexible work arrangements.

01:16.807 --> 01:17.623
Thank you, Nora.

01:18.126 --> 01:18.717
You're welcome.
