July 20th, 1969.

00:06.314 --> 00:12.549
It's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.

00:14.143 --> 00:19.852
In school, you were taught that Apollo 11 lost contact with the world for two minutes.

00:28.264 --> 00:28.895
Not true.

00:31.835 --> 00:39.753
They found something on that day that they kept hidden for 50 years...

00:41.813 --> 00:45.918
...and now, it's too late to stop.

00:50.191 --> 00:51.407
In breaking news,...

00:51.541 --> 00:56.040
...the governor has just ordered the mass evacuation of the entire West Coast.

00:56.372 --> 00:59.748
Moving to higher ground is the only possible chance of survival.

01:01.500 --> 01:06.275
This planet has suffered five extinctions.

01:07.833 --> 01:10.462
This is going to be the sixth.

01:20.736 --> 01:21.331
Are we dead?

01:23.786 --> 01:25.852
No, we are just inside the moon.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.889
That might be the greatest sentence anyone's ever said.
