Once upon a time in Dickensian days, there was a banana...

00:04.853 --> 00:05.999
Merry Christmas.

00:06.063 --> 00:07.175
...stuck in his ways.

00:07.293 --> 00:10.374
Snowmen, mince pies, chocolate reindeer.

00:10.477 --> 00:12.075
That's not the spirit, Ebanana.

00:14.255 --> 00:16.772
But what was the cause of him being so rotten?

00:17.244 --> 00:17.909
Santa.

00:17.996 --> 00:21.166
Being left on the plate, alone and forgotten.

00:22.499 --> 00:23.018
Who are you?

00:23.099 --> 00:24.974
I'm the Spirit of Christmas...

00:25.243 --> 00:27.622
...and I'm going to show you how magical it can be.

00:28.109 --> 00:30.911
Christmas is a time for peace and goodwill!

00:31.525 --> 00:31.829
Look!

00:32.099 --> 00:33.117
There's Marcus Radishford!

00:33.293 --> 00:34.700
He's always helping children.

00:34.855 --> 00:35.957
Merry Christmas, Kevin!

00:36.281 --> 00:42.665
As Old Ebanana soared through the skies, he began to see Christmas through Kevin's eyes.

00:48.017 --> 00:48.980
Oh, that looks painful.

00:49.110 --> 00:50.129
You should try icing it!

00:50.779 --> 00:53.731
Realizing the sadness and misery he had brought...

00:54.033 --> 00:56.875
...gave Ebanana more food for thought.

01:05.687 --> 01:07.263
Merry Christmas, everyone!

01:07.561 --> 01:09.537
This is for putting up with me!

01:11.137 --> 01:12.267
Moral of the story,...

01:12.549 --> 01:14.157
...the answer you'll find...

01:14.633 --> 01:15.584
Thanks, Ebanana!

01:15.657 --> 01:18.759
...for you to be happy, you need to be kind.
