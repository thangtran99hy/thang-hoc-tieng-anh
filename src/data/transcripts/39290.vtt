00:00.493 --> 00:02.343
Have you heard about Farmer Christmas?

00:02.450 --> 00:03.962
You mean Father Christmas, right?

00:04.583 --> 00:04.886
No.

00:05.944 --> 00:07.507
But he brings us the presents.

00:07.963 --> 00:08.550
Come here.

00:11.946 --> 00:12.685
There he is!

00:13.173 --> 00:14.529
Farmer Christmas!

00:16.929 --> 00:18.321
He works all year, too.

00:18.617 --> 00:20.409
But the big man's got the sleigh.

00:20.838 --> 00:21.763
So is he.

00:28.791 --> 00:29.484
His reindeer.

00:29.594 --> 00:30.009
Right?

00:32.451 --> 00:33.242
Where are we?

00:33.785 --> 00:34.831
His workshop.

00:35.422 --> 00:37.088
He's even got magic helpers.

00:37.753 --> 00:38.721
Loads of them.

00:46.443 --> 00:47.121
He's been.

00:47.376 --> 00:48.264
I told you.

00:51.857 --> 00:53.355
Can I tell you a secret?
