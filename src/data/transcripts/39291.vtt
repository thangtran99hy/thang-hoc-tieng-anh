00:00.305 --> 00:02.320
What a time to be so young,...

00:02.668 --> 00:04.763
...missing out on things we should have done.

00:05.203 --> 00:07.822
All those new chapters, the first day of school,...

00:08.296 --> 00:10.701
...making new friends, spending time with them all.

00:10.980 --> 00:13.871
The stories we tell when we grew up and look back,...

00:14.247 --> 00:17.107
...haven't even been written; those pages are blank.

00:17.295 --> 00:20.556
And now Christmas is coming; the goose is getting fat.

00:21.439 --> 00:23.689
The year we just had, we can all say that.

00:24.331 --> 00:26.975
So let's make this Christmas one to really remember.

00:27.267 --> 00:29.769
Do everything bigger, the best ever December.

00:30.653 --> 00:32.839
Find secret places to wrap every box.

00:33.128 --> 00:35.261
Dress up the tree; fill up your socks.

00:35.959 --> 00:38.541
Do nothing by halves, all things considered.

00:38.803 --> 00:41.010
Let Debenhams help and have Christmas delivered.

00:41.884 --> 00:44.517
Make magical memories for the ones that we missed...

00:44.927 --> 00:47.103
...because being together is what's top of the list.

00:48.095 --> 00:50.924
So that years from now, our kids will still say,...

00:51.420 --> 00:54.157
..."Christmas this year was my best ever day."
