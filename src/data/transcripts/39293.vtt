If you want to get lost at sea in the best way possible,...

00:03.683 --> 00:05.409
...you need to head to the Maldives.

00:05.492 --> 00:11.003
The Maldives is a tropical nation in the Indian Ocean comprised of 26 ring-shaped atolls,...

00:11.087 --> 00:14.081
...which are made up of more than 1,000 coral islands.

00:14.303 --> 00:17.899
It's known for its beaches, blue lagoons and extensive reefs.

00:18.065 --> 00:19.201
Now, when you go to the Maldives,...

00:19.349 --> 00:21.201
...you have two options for places to stay.

00:21.321 --> 00:25.573
The first, you pay a ton of money and you stay in a very nice all-inclusive resort.

00:25.773 --> 00:30.059
They were saying it is 10,000 dollars per night for the top room here.

00:30.191 --> 00:34.291
The second, you travel with some friends, hire a surf boat and just island-hop.

00:39.752 --> 00:43.737
There is nothing in the whole world like living on a boat in the middle of the Indian Ocean.

00:43.893 --> 00:45.552
Early September is a good time to visit.

00:45.730 --> 00:49.579
The weather was beautiful and the surf was very, very good.

00:53.132 --> 00:57.110
And if you're not into surfing, you can always island-hop and hang out with some locals,...

00:58.922 --> 01:04.947
...go freediving on one of the many reefs or even find your deserted island all to yourself.
