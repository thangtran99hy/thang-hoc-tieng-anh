00:01.576 --> 00:04.501
When the waters began to rise and war broke out,...

00:06.709 --> 00:08.375
...nostalgia became a way of life.

00:09.941 --> 00:15.247
There wasn't a lot to look forward to, so people began looking back.

00:16.659 --> 00:18.510
Nothing is more addictive than the past.

00:19.061 --> 00:20.372
No, no, no, no, put me back.

00:20.663 --> 00:21.187
Put me back.

00:24.449 --> 00:26.322
She has moved on and you should too.

00:26.488 --> 00:28.562
People don't just vanish.

00:30.930 --> 00:33.503
To find where she'd gone, I had to know where she'd been.

00:35.257 --> 00:36.408
Don't go down this path.

00:36.615 --> 00:38.657
Stay here, in this life.

00:40.446 --> 00:45.183
How close can you get before the illusion is broken?

00:51.986 --> 00:53.105
You're going on a journey.

00:54.470 --> 00:56.416
All you have to do is follow my voice.
