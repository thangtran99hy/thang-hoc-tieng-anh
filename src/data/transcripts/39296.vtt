00:01.681 --> 00:03.334
I have an announcement to make.

00:03.668 --> 00:06.962
One of our students, Finney Blake, was abducted.

00:07.887 --> 00:10.686
What if I can help the police find Finney?

00:20.133 --> 00:21.020
Does it work?

00:23.362 --> 00:24.775
Not since I was a kid.

00:25.459 --> 00:26.209
I'll scream.

00:26.344 --> 00:27.377
I'll scratch your face.

00:27.882 --> 00:28.675
This face?

00:32.211 --> 00:34.070
Daddy, I had a dream about it.

00:34.396 --> 00:35.605
What happened in your dream?

00:35.910 --> 00:36.675
He was taken.

00:36.847 --> 00:38.090
By a man with black balloons?

00:38.205 --> 00:38.788
Yes.

00:38.910 --> 00:40.603
We never released those details.

00:52.671 --> 00:53.039
Hello?

00:53.547 --> 00:54.124
Don't hang up.

00:54.983 --> 00:55.674
Who are you?

00:58.670 --> 00:59.731
You know all our names?

01:01.589 --> 01:02.513
You're getting out of here.

01:05.179 --> 01:07.239
Please, please let the dreams be real.

01:07.572 --> 01:08.565
See the wall in front of you?

01:08.865 --> 01:10.485
I tore a long cable loose from down there.

01:12.725 --> 01:15.277
There's a combination lock on the inside of the storm door.

01:15.373 --> 01:16.203
What's the combination?

01:18.302 --> 01:19.426
I carved it on the wall.

01:19.927 --> 01:23.704
The tree, the door, the gate, I've never seen it before except in my dream.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.636
You don't have much time!

01:28.565 --> 01:29.526
You're gonna use a weapon.

01:29.894 --> 01:32.410
You raise the phone, step back, and swing.
