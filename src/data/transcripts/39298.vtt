00:00.050 --> 00:01.495
Young people don't want to be talked about.

00:01.679 --> 00:02.901
We want to do the talking.

00:07.002 --> 00:09.203
We've been told to clean up our mess.

00:10.930 --> 00:13.153
We've been told to be kind to others.

00:16.615 --> 00:18.894
We've been told that we should be fair.

00:21.897 --> 00:27.884
We've listened to adults, but now it's time for them to listen to us.

00:29.884 --> 00:32.977
Right here, right now is where we draw the line.

00:33.098 --> 00:35.734
It's time, it's time, it's time.

00:35.879 --> 00:39.730
Don't forget to listen to the most affected people.

00:39.891 --> 00:44.114
It's time to remind them that big changes can start small...

00:45.179 --> 00:48.507
...and that only together, can we change the world.

00:49.953 --> 00:51.342
Don't give up on adults.

00:52.511 --> 00:54.048
We know they can do it.
