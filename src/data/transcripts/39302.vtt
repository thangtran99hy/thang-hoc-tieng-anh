00:00.131 --> 00:02.011
From the snowy peaks of the Himalayas,...

00:02.643 --> 00:05.491
...peaceful Buddhist temples and lush green nature parks,...

00:05.716 --> 00:07.551
...Nepal really has something for everyone.

00:09.221 --> 00:12.273
Backpackers can spend as little as 20 to 30 dollars a day...

00:12.359 --> 00:13.687
...in total for a bed for the night,...

00:15.135 --> 00:17.493
...transport, attraction prices and food.

00:18.461 --> 00:22.104
What's even better is that this trekkers' paradise is friendly on a shoestring budget,...

00:22.242 --> 00:23.580
...even massive trekking trips...

00:25.686 --> 00:30.101
...such as an 11-day hike in Langtang Valley will only set you back a few hundred dollars,...

00:31.493 --> 00:34.179
...a quarter of what a trek to Everest base camp would cost.

00:35.558 --> 00:39.987
If you're feeling hungry, dal bhat, or lentils with rice, is a local favorite...

00:40.207 --> 00:41.795
...and it will cost you less than one dollar.
