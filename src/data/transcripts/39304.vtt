Good evening, are you ready to order?

00:03.661 --> 00:06.904
Well, first, can you tell me please, what is today's soup?

00:07.179 --> 00:08.158
It's bean soup.

00:08.334 --> 00:09.203
It's very good.

00:09.571 --> 00:11.863
Okay, I'd like soup as a starter...

00:12.493 --> 00:15.685
...and then could I have veal escalope for my main course.

00:16.011 --> 00:17.537
Is that with salad?

00:17.945 --> 00:19.289
With vegetables please.

00:19.452 --> 00:20.268
Certainly, madam.

00:20.672 --> 00:23.215
I'd like the same for my starter, please.

00:23.580 --> 00:28.855
And then I'd like spaghetti bolognese for my main course with salad.

00:29.356 --> 00:30.022
And you, sir?

00:30.341 --> 00:32.581
Could I have risotto as a starter, please?

00:33.075 --> 00:34.937
And then what is chicken amalfi?

00:35.091 --> 00:36.295
It's our speciality.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.305
It's chicken with tomato and mushroom sauce.

00:39.547 --> 00:41.565
That sounds good. I'd like that, please.

00:42.886 --> 00:44.583
Would you like something to drink?

00:45.142 --> 00:46.669
Mary, Anna, would you like wine?

00:46.880 --> 00:48.067
I'd love a glass of red wine.

00:49.020 --> 00:49.856
The house wine?

00:50.227 --> 00:51.479
Yes, that's fine, thanks.

00:51.754 --> 00:53.957
I'd just like some sparkling water.

00:54.578 --> 00:59.015
Okay, two glasses of the house red wine and a bottle of sparkling water, please.

00:59.213 --> 00:59.879
Very good.

01:06.601 --> 01:08.701
They have very good desserts here too.

01:08.821 --> 01:10.781
The ice cream is wonderful.

01:11.111 --> 01:13.724
Great! I love Italian ice cream.

Me too.
