00:00.287 --> 00:02.297
Cambodia is a country with a rich history,...

00:02.563 --> 00:04.605
...amazing food and a decent nightlife scene...

00:05.139 --> 00:07.141
...similar to its neighbors Vietnam and Thailand,...

00:07.829 --> 00:10.393
...but it's one that is a lot less developed and less visited.

00:10.834 --> 00:12.636
The cost of living in this country is cheap.

00:12.899 --> 00:16.519
You can easily spend a month in Cambodia with just 1,000 dollars.

00:17.897 --> 00:21.504
There are some one-off expenses such as the three-day pass to Angkor Wat...

00:21.780 --> 00:25.245
...which is currently set at 62 dollars, and diving trips that add up,...

00:25.965 --> 00:29.161
...but there will also be days of riding bicycles in a small village...

00:29.255 --> 00:31.021
...and eating cheap and delicious food.

00:31.662 --> 00:35.847
You can spend around 1 to 3 dollars for a local meal at a restaurant or on the street.

00:37.095 --> 00:38.880
Accommodations won't cost you much more.

00:39.247 --> 00:44.077
Get a double room with a fan for 4 dollars, and an air-conditioned room for 6 to 8 dollars.

00:44.705 --> 00:46.247
You can choose what you spend, of course,...

00:46.592 --> 00:50.031
...and a decent hotel room will still only be around 15 to 20 dollars.
