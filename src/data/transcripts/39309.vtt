Hi, I'm Stina.

00:06.147 --> 00:07.609
Welcome to Iceland Academy.

00:08.152 --> 00:11.685
In today's class, I'll be showing you how to practice safe selfies.

00:12.117 --> 00:15.234
You see, even though Iceland has a scenery to die for,...

00:15.632 --> 00:18.055
...it doesn't actually mean that you need to die for it.

00:20.181 --> 00:24.173
We all love a good selfie and some go to great lengths to capture them,...

00:24.692 --> 00:27.999
...but please don't take any risk by going out on slippery ledges.

00:28.365 --> 00:31.141
I can assure you, you will still get lots of likes.

00:32.619 --> 00:34.293
I know you want to look hot in a selfie,...

00:34.686 --> 00:38.207
...but some hot springs and geysers can be over a hundred degrees Celsius,...

00:38.566 --> 00:40.382
...so please admire from a distance.

00:43.126 --> 00:47.559
Some beaches in Iceland are known for their unpredictable waves and strong current.

00:48.107 --> 00:52.196
So, one minute you are Cara Delevingne, and the next you're Sarah never seen.

00:52.744 --> 00:55.319
So, please watch out not being too close to the water.

00:55.938 --> 00:59.031
It's really easy to take amazing selfies here in Iceland.

00:59.311 --> 01:00.456
You don't even need a filter.

01:00.908 --> 01:02.457
So please don't take any risks.

01:02.662 --> 01:06.708
Follow local information, obey the signs and stay safe.

01:08.998 --> 01:11.231
Oh, already got over 100 likes.
