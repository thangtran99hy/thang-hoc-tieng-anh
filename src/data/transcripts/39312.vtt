Hi, I'm Wilbur,...

00:01.525 --> 00:06.346
...and I've noticed that everyone's talking about one thing lately: Christmas!

00:06.519 --> 00:10.381
I decided to ask my friends at Webcertain what all the fuss is about,...

00:10.711 --> 00:14.745
...and they told me that Christmas is a very special time of year...

00:15.059 --> 00:17.925
...that's celebrated differently in different countries.

00:18.194 --> 00:20.344
My friend Barbara is from Italy,...

00:20.436 --> 00:27.091
...and she says that a very important part of an Italian Christmas is the nativity scene.

00:27.467 --> 00:32.543
Most families have their own miniature nativity scenes that they put up at home,...

00:32.810 --> 00:36.929
...but the baby Jesus is not put into his crib until Christmas Day.

00:37.989 --> 00:41.553
Food and family are very important at this time of year,...

00:41.649 --> 00:46.277
...and families come together to feast multiple times throughout the festive season.

00:46.449 --> 00:50.433
Another popular Christmas family activity is playing tombola,...

00:50.569 --> 00:54.377
...which in Italy is similar to a game of bingo.

00:55.493 --> 00:59.156
Christmas celebrations last from the beginning of December...

00:59.280 --> 01:01.578
...all the way to the beginning of January,...

01:01.905 --> 01:07.614
...and on the 6th of January, a good witch known as "La Befana"...

01:07.913 --> 01:11.847
...fills the children's stockings with sweets if they've been good,...

01:11.961 --> 01:14.202
...and coal if they've been bad!

01:15.362 --> 01:18.205
I hope you've enjoyed learning how they do things in Italy.

01:18.347 --> 01:21.578
Happy Christmas from everyone here at Webcertain!
