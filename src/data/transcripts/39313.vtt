Hi, I'm Wilbur.

00:01.783 --> 00:07.179
I've noticed that everyone's been getting really excited about one thing lately: Christmas!

00:07.512 --> 00:09.867
We don't have Christmas back in Monstonia,...

00:10.091 --> 00:13.315
...so I've asked my friends at Webcertain what it's all about,...

00:13.543 --> 00:18.560
...and it seems that different countries have their own unique Christmas traditions.

00:19.013 --> 00:21.095
My friend Jens is from Germany,...

00:21.267 --> 00:26.101
...and he says that the festive season begins on the night of the 5th of December,...

00:26.351 --> 00:30.790
...when children clean their shoes and leave them outside the front door overnight.

00:31.271 --> 00:34.434
When they wake up in the morning, their shoes are filled with sweets,...

00:34.538 --> 00:37.602
...nuts and other little presents from St. Nicholas!

00:37.895 --> 00:41.993
Another important German Christmas tradition is the advent wreath.

00:42.750 --> 00:48.149
This is made of dried flowers, berries and pine cones, along with four candles.

00:48.727 --> 00:53.135
Every week throughout the month of December, they light one candle every Sunday.

00:53.339 --> 00:56.349
They actually celebrate Christmas on Christmas Eve,...

00:56.667 --> 01:00.790
...and on this day, children will sing Christmas songs for the Christmas angel...

01:01.027 --> 01:02.624
...known as the "Christkind,"...

01:02.843 --> 01:04.703
...which brings them presents.

01:04.938 --> 01:07.325
Once the Christmas angel has delivered the gifts,...

01:07.415 --> 01:10.785
...a bell rings to let the children know they can stop singing.

01:10.986 --> 01:12.615
The fun doesn't stop there!

01:12.945 --> 01:16.083
In southern Germany, on the 6th of January,...

01:16.385 --> 01:20.276
...children celebrate Epiphany by dressing up as the three kings...

01:20.479 --> 01:23.424
...and going around neighbors' houses to sing songs...

01:23.499 --> 01:26.235
...and raise money for children's charities.

01:27.765 --> 01:30.828
I hope you've enjoyed learning how they do things in Germany.

01:31.108 --> 01:34.355
Happy Christmas from everyone here at Webcertain.
