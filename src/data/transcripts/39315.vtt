As the COVID-19 epidemic sweeps across the world,...

00:04.545 --> 00:07.479
...it's been accompanied by a tsunami of misinformation.

00:09.393 --> 00:11.566
Drink lemon and bicarbonate.

00:11.975 --> 00:13.065
Oh my god.

00:13.917 --> 00:14.837
Chloroquine.

00:15.629 --> 00:20.407
Hold your breath over 10 seconds to check if your lung is healthy.

00:20.505 --> 00:24.258
If you keep sipping hot water, that washes it down to your stomach.

00:24.578 --> 00:28.271
At the time when reliable information is vital for public health,...

00:28.685 --> 00:33.196
...fake news about COVID-19 might be spreading even faster than the facts.

00:33.693 --> 00:35.781
We're not just fighting an epidemic.

00:36.225 --> 00:38.479
We're fighting an infodemic.

00:39.233 --> 00:43.031
Fake news spreads faster and more easily than this virus...

00:43.501 --> 00:45.573
...and is just as dangerous.

00:46.168 --> 00:48.527
Researchers across the globe are working...

00:48.592 --> 00:51.226
...to understand how misinformation spreads,...

00:51.750 --> 00:55.755
...and new models suggest that while the fight against fake news can seem hopeless,...

00:56.179 --> 00:58.919
...it might not take too much effort to tip the balance.
