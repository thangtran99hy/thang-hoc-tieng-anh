Have you ever shared news online...

00:05.615 --> 00:07.329
...or talked about it with your friends?

00:08.658 --> 00:11.599
Maybe it was something that shocked you or made you laugh,...

00:13.194 --> 00:16.721
...but did you stop to think, is this real?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.979
Fake news is a problem because it can make you believe things...

00:23.081 --> 00:27.692
...that are completely untrue and that could affect how you make important decisions.

00:29.104 --> 00:30.671
A lot of fake news is made up...

00:30.943 --> 00:33.015
...to get you to click on links and share them.

00:33.325 --> 00:38.446
If you do share fake news, people might be making money off of you from advertising.

00:39.091 --> 00:40.916
So how do you know what's real?

00:42.789 --> 00:43.625
Ask yourself.

00:44.043 --> 00:46.465
Has the story been reported anywhere else?

00:47.478 --> 00:49.819
Have you heard of the organization that published it?

00:50.907 --> 00:55.155
Is the story on an official website, for example, ending in .com?

00:57.591 --> 01:01.050
A .com.co website could be unreliable.

01:03.621 --> 01:06.419
Look at the photo, video or story.

01:06.882 --> 01:08.575
Does it look a bit strange to you?

01:08.955 --> 01:12.408
If the answer is yes, maybe it's fake.
