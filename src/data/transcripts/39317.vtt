Technology has brought us to a point where we can no longer believe...

00:03.288 --> 00:05.939
...everything we hear, read or even see.

00:06.822 --> 00:09.696
This altered video of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi...

00:09.788 --> 00:12.641
...was slowed down to make her sound intoxicated.

00:13.027 --> 00:15.121
In 2018, misinformation was to blame...

00:15.191 --> 00:19.000
...for fueling chaos, confusion, violence and death in Myanmar.

00:19.141 --> 00:22.332
It triggered mob attacks that left dozens dead in India.

00:22.463 --> 00:25.763
Experts are calling this current era "information disorder."

00:26.241 --> 00:28.551
Its main contributors are misinformation,...

00:28.787 --> 00:32.316
...which is when false information is shared without the intention to harm...

00:32.698 --> 00:37.868
...and disinformation, when false information is knowingly shared to cause harm.

00:38.112 --> 00:41.183
And while research has shown that YouTube played a major part...

00:41.284 --> 00:43.989
...in convincing some people that the Earth is flat,...

00:44.555 --> 00:47.535
...technology isn't the only factor to blame in all of this.

00:48.205 --> 00:51.981
There is also a growing distrust for science and institution.

00:52.223 --> 00:54.912
Social media giants like Facebook, Twitter and Google...

00:55.001 --> 00:58.575
...have promised to curb misinformation on topics like vaccines...

00:59.069 --> 01:03.921
...so legitimate news sources are prioritized instead of posts with higher engagement.

01:04.289 --> 01:06.211
And then there are companies like Storyful.

01:06.538 --> 01:12.301
The agency finds, verifies and licenses user-generated, newsworthy or viral content...

01:12.663 --> 01:16.083
...on behalf of media organizations including global news.
