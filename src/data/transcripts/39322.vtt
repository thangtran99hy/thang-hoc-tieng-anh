In previous decades, most media with global reach...

00:04.144 --> 00:07.210
...consisted of several major newspapers and networks...

00:07.483 --> 00:11.019
...which had the resources to gather information directly.

00:11.717 --> 00:14.503
Outlets like Reuters and the Associated Press...

00:14.762 --> 00:17.105
...that aggregate or re-report stories...

00:17.399 --> 00:19.939
...were relatively rare compared to today.

00:20.561 --> 00:23.313
The speed with which information spreads now...

00:23.621 --> 00:25.717
...has created the ideal conditions...

00:25.915 --> 00:28.689
...for a phenomenon known as circular reporting.

00:29.358 --> 00:32.825
This is when publication A publishes misinformation,...

00:33.201 --> 00:35.355
...publication B reprints it,...

00:35.647 --> 00:40.815
...and publication A then cites B as the source for the information.

00:41.446 --> 00:46.115
It's also considered a form of circular reporting when multiple publications...

00:46.366 --> 00:49.870
...report on the same initial piece of false information,...

00:50.126 --> 00:52.179
...which then appears to another author...

00:52.397 --> 00:55.033
...as having been verified by multiple sources.

00:56.126 --> 01:01.481
For instance, the 1998 publication of a single pseudoscientific paper...

01:01.703 --> 01:05.451
...arguing that routine vaccination of children causes autism...

01:05.777 --> 01:08.992
...inspired an entire anti-vaccination movement,...

01:09.351 --> 01:11.425
...despite the fact that the original paper...

01:11.727 --> 01:15.238
...has repeatedly been discredited by the scientific community.

01:16.133 --> 01:21.039
Deliberately unvaccinated children are now contracting contagious diseases...

01:21.270 --> 01:24.323
...that had been virtually eradicated in the United States,...

01:24.729 --> 01:26.645
...with some infections proving fatal.
