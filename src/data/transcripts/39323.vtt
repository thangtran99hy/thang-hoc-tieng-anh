00:00.572 --> 00:02.471
In a slightly less dire example,...

00:02.810 --> 00:06.399
...satirical articles that are formatted to resemble real ones...

00:06.681 --> 00:10.475
...can also be picked up by outlets not in on the joke.

00:10.995 --> 00:15.425
For example, a joke article in the reputable British Medical Journal...

00:15.793 --> 00:18.867
...entitled "Energy Expenditure in Adolescents...

00:18.985 --> 00:21.205
...Playing New Generation Computer Games,"...

00:21.579 --> 00:26.510
...has been referenced in serious science publications over 400 times.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.821
User-generated content such as wikis...

00:30.023 --> 00:33.355
...are also a common contributor to circular reporting.

00:33.881 --> 00:37.565
As more writers come to rely on such pages for quick information,...

00:37.949 --> 00:40.221
...an unverified fact in a wiki page...

00:40.457 --> 00:42.674
...can make its way into a published article...

00:42.850 --> 00:45.325
...that may later be added as a citation...

00:45.589 --> 00:47.615
...for the very same wiki information,...

00:47.917 --> 00:49.774
...making it much harder to debunk.

00:50.719 --> 00:53.327
Recent advances in communication technology...

00:53.570 --> 00:55.252
...have had immeasurable benefits...

00:55.442 --> 00:58.741
...in breaking down the barriers between information and people,...

00:59.255 --> 01:01.027
...but our desire for quick answers...

01:01.235 --> 01:04.600
...may overpower the desire to be certain of their validity...

01:05.029 --> 01:09.339
...and when this bias can be multiplied by billions of people around the world...

01:09.543 --> 01:13.073
...nearly instantaneously, more caution is in order.

01:13.759 --> 01:15.683
Avoiding sensationalist media...

01:15.959 --> 01:18.808
...searching for criticisms of suspicious information,...

01:19.044 --> 01:23.729
...and tracing the original source of a report can help slow down a lie,...

01:24.239 --> 01:26.957
...giving the truth more time to put on its shoes.
