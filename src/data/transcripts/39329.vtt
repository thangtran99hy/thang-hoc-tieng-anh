Smile and learn.

00:09.799 --> 00:12.314
Hello, everyone.

00:12.753 --> 00:15.684
How do you like my new bike?

00:16.250 --> 00:17.244
What is it?

00:17.819 --> 00:18.709
Oh, right.

00:19.033 --> 00:19.919
I see.

00:20.101 --> 00:21.761
Yes, I know.

00:22.361 --> 00:23.308
I'm big.

00:23.816 --> 00:29.191
In fact, I'm not just big, I'm huge!

00:29.492 --> 00:30.659
Enormous.

00:31.011 --> 00:33.885
Many would say, gigantic!

00:34.761 --> 00:39.385
See how many words I've used to describe myself?

00:39.792 --> 00:43.675
Big, huge, enormous, gigantic!

00:44.319 --> 00:47.488
All four words have the same meaning.

00:48.169 --> 00:51.273
Do you know how we call words that mean the same...
