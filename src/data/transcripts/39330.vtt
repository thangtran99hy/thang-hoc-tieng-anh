Antonyms.

00:03.564 --> 00:08.200
Antonyms are words that have the opposite meaning as other words.

00:09.503 --> 00:13.781
For example, the word "small" is the opposite of the word "big."

00:14.369 --> 00:18.076
The word "hot" is the opposite of the word "cold."

00:19.357 --> 00:22.489
A word can have more than one antonym!

00:22.760 --> 00:24.496
Let's take a look at an example.

00:25.384 --> 00:29.107
The word "hot" is the opposite of the word "cold,"...

00:29.597 --> 00:32.943
...and the word "chilly" and the word "freezing"...

00:33.357 --> 00:37.177
...so the word "hot" has more than one antonym.

00:38.481 --> 00:41.704
See if you can find the antonyms in the following examples:

00:43.301 --> 00:46.523
There was a loud noise coming from the other room.

00:47.003 --> 00:49.396
Which word in this sentence is the antonym...

00:49.504 --> 00:52.311
...or the opposite meaning of the word "quiet"?

00:53.254 --> 00:56.069
If you said "loud," then you are correct.

00:56.477 --> 01:01.159
"Loud" and "quiet" have opposite meanings therefore they're antonyms.

01:02.689 --> 01:04.959
He came to school late today.

01:05.693 --> 01:08.621
Which word in this sentence is the antonym...

01:08.717 --> 01:11.473
...or the opposite meaning of the word "early"?

01:12.989 --> 01:15.667
If you said "late," then you are correct.

01:16.115 --> 01:21.100
"Late" and "early" have opposite meanings, therefore they're both antonyms.
