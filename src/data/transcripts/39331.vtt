00:00.543 --> 00:01.677
Prefixes.

00:03.655 --> 00:06.652
Prefixes are added to the beginning of a base word.

00:07.062 --> 00:08.923
For example, the word "repaint."

00:09.350 --> 00:13.451
"Paint" is the base word, "re" in the beginning is the prefix.

00:14.413 --> 00:18.225
Prefixes change the meaning of the word that it's added to.

00:19.698 --> 00:24.107
For example, when I add "re" to a word, it means to do again,...

00:25.416 --> 00:30.328
...like when I say "repaint" or "reread" or "rewrite."

00:31.061 --> 00:31.832
Reheat.

00:32.218 --> 00:37.253
All these words means to "do again," so paint again, read again,...

00:37.394 --> 00:39.461
...write again or heat it again.

00:40.142 --> 00:44.893
When I add the prefix "un" to a word, it means "not,"...

00:46.380 --> 00:50.167
...like if I say "unhappy," that means not happy.

00:50.645 --> 00:53.052
"Unfair" means it is not fair.

00:53.403 --> 00:55.819
"Unlock" means don't lock it.

00:57.461 --> 01:02.175
When I add the prefix "pre" to a word, it means "before."

01:03.525 --> 01:08.413
For example, when I say "preview," it means to view it before...

01:08.559 --> 01:10.741
...or see it or look at it before.

01:11.143 --> 01:14.995
When I say "precook," it means to cook it beforehand.

01:16.399 --> 01:20.979
When I add the prefix "mis" to a word, it means "wrong."

01:22.607 --> 01:28.189
So the word "misspell" means that it was spelled wrong or incorrectly.

01:28.637 --> 01:33.407
The word "misunderstood" means that they were understood the wrong way.

01:34.382 --> 01:39.063
When I add the prefix "dis" to a word, it means "opposite of."

01:40.279 --> 01:45.524
For example, if I say "dislike," that is the opposite of the word "like."

01:45.909 --> 01:50.347
If I say "disagree," that is the opposite of the word "agree,"...

01:50.460 --> 01:52.094
...which means they don't agree.

01:53.302 --> 01:55.948
Now you know how important prefixes are...

01:56.055 --> 01:59.059
...and how they can change the meaning of the entire word.
