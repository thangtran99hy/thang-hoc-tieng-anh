00:00.520 --> 00:01.311
Suffixes.

00:03.683 --> 00:06.311
Suffixes are added to the end of a base word.

00:06.773 --> 00:09.083
Let's take a look at the word sleepy.

00:09.407 --> 00:11.927
We know that sleep is the base word.

00:12.285 --> 00:15.192
That means the "y" after "sleep" is a suffix.

00:16.653 --> 00:21.975
So, just like prefixes, suffixes also change the meaning of the word.

00:23.391 --> 00:28.783
Let's take a look at a few examples of how a suffix can change the meaning of the word.

00:30.266 --> 00:36.007
When I add the suffix "y" to the end of a word, it means "full of".

00:37.545 --> 00:42.027
So, if I say he is sleepy, that means he is "full of sleep".

00:42.435 --> 00:47.358
Or if I say the sky is cloudy, that means the sky is "full of clouds".

00:48.377 --> 00:51.884
When I add the suffix "ly" to the end of the word,...

00:52.100 --> 00:54.485
...it means to do in a certain way.

00:55.439 --> 00:58.993
For example, when I say the man is walking slowly,...

00:59.424 --> 01:02.699
...I mean to say he is walking "in a slow way".

01:02.911 --> 01:06.148
If I say this decision was made fairly,...

01:06.367 --> 01:09.183
...that means that decision was done "in a fair way".

01:10.411 --> 01:15.377
When I add the suffix full to a word, it means "full of".

01:16.473 --> 01:20.758
For example, when I say "beautiful", it means "full of beauty".

01:21.169 --> 01:24.331
Or "colorful", which means "full of color".

01:25.539 --> 01:30.335
When I add the suffix "less" to the end of a word, it means "without".

01:31.441 --> 01:35.671
Like when I say "fearless" which means "without fear".

01:36.451 --> 01:40.975
When I add the suffix "er" to the end of a word, it could mean two things.

01:41.351 --> 01:45.445
It could mean "more" or it could mean "someone who".

01:46.241 --> 01:50.351
For example, in the word "smaller", the suffix "er" here...

01:50.462 --> 01:55.277
...is used to show that one item or one animal is smaller than the other one.

01:55.717 --> 01:57.845
However, when I say the word "singer",...

01:58.184 --> 02:02.247
...the suffix "er" here is used to show "someone who sings".

02:03.321 --> 02:08.592
Finally, when I add the suffix "est" to a word, it means "most".

02:10.306 --> 02:15.375
For example, if I want to say this man is the most strong out of his friends,...

02:15.715 --> 02:17.284
...I say "strongest".

02:17.877 --> 02:21.493
Or if I want to say he's the most tall out of his friends,...

02:21.629 --> 02:22.885
...I say "tallest".
