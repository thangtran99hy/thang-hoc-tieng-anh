We knew that if we were going to tell a story that was inspired by Colombia,...

00:03.784 --> 00:05.421
...we wanted it to feel true.

00:06.234 --> 00:07.699
We went and visited the Cocora Valley,...

00:07.874 --> 00:10.537
...one of the most beautiful places I've ever been to.

00:10.867 --> 00:13.311
We knew this is where the home of the Madrigals should be.

00:13.421 --> 00:16.949
This movie, it's about family and your role within your family.

00:17.591 --> 00:19.877
I hope that people go see it with their families.

00:20.039 --> 00:23.135
I think people will see themselves in the different family members.

00:23.399 --> 00:25.052
We have an amazing family.

00:25.235 --> 00:27.167
It's just a joyous experience.

00:27.990 --> 00:29.908
To me, it's really important to tell stories...

00:30.006 --> 00:32.261
...where there's goodness and hope in the world.

00:32.327 --> 00:35.501
Music can help tell stories in an animated realm.

00:36.427 --> 00:40.193
In "Encanto," working on original songs with 12 original characters,...

00:40.300 --> 00:41.779
...it's really, really exciting.

00:41.855 --> 00:43.435
There's this family, the Madrigal family,...

00:43.591 --> 00:46.074
...and they've been blessed with these magical gifts.

00:46.203 --> 00:51.570
These characters are having emotional breakthroughs and reunions all in song.

00:51.693 --> 00:55.704
The filmmakers put a great amount of faith in me to be able to musicalize this.

00:55.785 --> 00:58.835
Colombia has a lot of rich musical traditions within itself...

00:58.943 --> 01:02.241
...that are unique to Colombia, but also there's an incredible amount of variety.

01:02.363 --> 01:05.626
Colombian music is special because we do it with our heart,...

01:05.713 --> 01:07.045
...you know, we do it with love.

01:07.155 --> 01:09.193
There's a beautiful story in every song.

01:15.587 --> 01:19.475
"Colombia, Mi Encanto," I wanted to just write the most joyous song possible,...

01:19.609 --> 01:21.100
...a love letter to Colombia itself.

01:22.941 --> 01:26.066
Obviously, Carlos Vives is a worldwide music figure.

01:26.148 --> 01:28.298
I was in love with his music already.

01:28.401 --> 01:30.875
That song is so inspired by his writings,...

01:31.027 --> 01:33.323
...and so to have him sing on that is like a dream.
