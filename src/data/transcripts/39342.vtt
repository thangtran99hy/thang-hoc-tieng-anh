00:02.471 --> 00:03.876
Is there water on Mars?

00:09.784 --> 00:11.932
The short answer is yes.

00:12.371 --> 00:15.470
Now, we have to think about, how do we actually define water?

00:15.690 --> 00:18.268
It's not quite like on Earth, but it's definitely there.

00:18.659 --> 00:24.391
Water is a molecule that has one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms.

00:24.650 --> 00:27.273
The ice on Mars is a little bit different than on Earth.

00:27.350 --> 00:30.259
On Earth, usually the ice is just water ice.

00:30.339 --> 00:34.632
But on Mars, it's actually water ice and CO2 ice mixed with each other.

00:34.769 --> 00:37.108
On Mars, it's just so cold that it gets frozen,...

00:37.194 --> 00:40.001
...so you actually have those mixed together both at the poles...

00:40.147 --> 00:42.167
...and underneath the surface as well.

00:42.567 --> 00:46.161
We even have water in the atmosphere as a water vapor.

00:46.490 --> 00:47.982
It's a very small amount, but it's there.

00:48.326 --> 00:51.139
We also have water inside of rocks.

00:51.229 --> 00:55.420
So, you can think about rocks as sort of a stack of layers...

00:55.729 --> 00:58.944
...and sometimes there's water trapped in between those layers.

00:59.094 --> 01:03.555
We've actually measured this with a lot of the different missions from NASA...

01:03.659 --> 01:05.093
...and that's actually what I study.

01:05.201 --> 01:10.600
And the last state of potential state of water is, do we have liquid water on Mars?

01:11.212 --> 01:13.517
The answer is we haven't really observed it.

01:13.746 --> 01:19.429
We do see these dark streaks on some hillsides that we call recurring slope linea.

01:19.844 --> 01:25.243
One idea is that these slope linea could be formed by the flow of liquid water,...

01:25.451 --> 01:29.435
...but there's also other ideas where you actually don't need liquid water...

01:29.518 --> 01:32.007
...to explain the formation of these dark streaks.

01:32.178 --> 01:35.322
Maybe they could form through sand flow or that kind of thing.

01:35.927 --> 01:37.620
So, is there water on Mars?

01:38.183 --> 01:41.229
Not quite like the oceans we know on Earth, but it's definitely there.
