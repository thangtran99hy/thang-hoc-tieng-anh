00:00.050 --> 00:02.462
At least one out of every three people...

00:02.569 --> 00:06.801
...will experience some form of insomnia in their lifetime.

00:06.978 --> 00:11.107
Insomnia is when you consistently have difficulties either falling asleep,...

00:11.475 --> 00:13.241
...difficulties staying asleep...

00:13.617 --> 00:17.964
...or you just donâ€™t feel refreshed or restored by your sleep the next day.

00:18.196 --> 00:19.865
Now, when sleep becomes difficult,...

00:19.964 --> 00:24.901
...there are many things that people understandably turn to for help,...

00:25.003 --> 00:27.753
...but not all of them work especially well.

00:32.851 --> 00:38.963
For instance, alcohol and THC, which is the psychoactive component of cannabis,...

00:39.145 --> 00:40.829
...are all popular options.

00:41.113 --> 00:43.849
However, both THC and alcohol...

00:44.009 --> 00:48.170
...will ultimately make your insomnia and your sleep difficulties worse...

00:48.407 --> 00:49.353
...rather than better.

00:49.620 --> 00:53.007
Even melatonin will only increase your sleep quality,...

00:53.177 --> 00:56.997
...or what we call your sleep efficiency, by just a few percent.

00:57.277 --> 01:02.087
Thankfully, however, there is a much more effective, drug-free approach...

01:02.278 --> 01:08.482
...called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia, or CBTI for short.

01:08.925 --> 01:11.842
And by working with a clinician for several weeks,...

01:12.163 --> 01:14.065
...which you can do online, by the way...

01:14.379 --> 01:19.685
...the therapy helps change your habits, your beliefs and your general stress...

01:19.927 --> 01:21.545
...around this thing called sleep.

01:22.144 --> 01:24.316
And there are now many studies that have shown...

01:24.420 --> 01:29.385
...CBTI to be just as effective as sleeping pills in the short term.

01:29.799 --> 01:34.758
Yet, CBTI has no negative side effects, unlike sleeping pills.

01:35.110 --> 01:38.435
In addition, after you stop working with your therapist,...

01:38.683 --> 01:41.945
...the sleep benefits can last for years later.

01:42.313 --> 01:45.297
CBTI is now, in fact, so powerful...

01:45.386 --> 01:49.639
...that it is our first-line recommended treatment for insomnia,...

01:49.843 --> 01:53.322
...and it allows you to regain your confidence...

01:53.587 --> 01:57.783
...in the ability to sleep well each and every night.
