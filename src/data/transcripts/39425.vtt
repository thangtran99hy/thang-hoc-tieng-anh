Okay, so this is the disputed poster.

00:03.474 --> 00:08.206
Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings...

00:08.505 --> 00:14.770
...using "I" emotion language, and no judging, or "You" statements.

00:15.012 --> 00:18.832
I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it every day.

00:19.225 --> 00:21.803
It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists...

00:21.931 --> 00:24.079
...and God has a really cute sense of humor.

00:24.399 --> 00:25.349
Come on, seriously that?

00:25.764 --> 00:27.231
I don't like looking at it.

00:27.686 --> 00:30.376
It's creepy and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me.

00:30.657 --> 00:33.765
It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers...

00:33.861 --> 00:35.221
...who forced the babies into it.

00:35.429 --> 00:37.355
It's kitsch, it's the opposite of art.

00:37.806 --> 00:40.362
Stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm...

00:40.465 --> 00:43.599
...and find some creative alternatives that are win-win.

00:43.694 --> 00:44.049
Win?

00:44.387 --> 00:45.541
Yes, thank you, Pam.

00:45.654 --> 00:51.363
How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt which Oscar wears?

00:51.631 --> 00:56.751
That way, he can never see it, and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it.

00:57.223 --> 00:58.595
Win, win, win.

00:58.697 --> 00:58.967
No.

00:59.155 --> 01:00.039
That's, no.

01:00.125 --> 01:01.367
Okay. Well, brainstorm.

01:01.462 --> 01:02.359
Own the solution.

01:02.505 --> 01:03.905
How about I leave it up?

01:04.045 --> 01:05.203
How about she takes it down?

01:05.747 --> 01:09.598
How about Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?

01:09.749 --> 01:13.012
Okay, that is called a compromise.
