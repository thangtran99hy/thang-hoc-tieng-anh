Hi, and welcome to this very natural setting.

00:07.369 --> 00:10.857
Today, I want to talk about a revolutionary approach...

00:11.127 --> 00:14.773
...on how to connect our world without being super weird.

00:16.502 --> 00:18.123
Some said it's not possible.

00:19.321 --> 00:21.547
Some said it's out of reach.

00:22.799 --> 00:25.405
To them, we say it's already here.

00:26.700 --> 00:28.263
Seriously, look, it's right here.

00:30.332 --> 00:34.447
And what do we call this not so new chapter in human connectivity?

00:35.513 --> 00:37.603
The Icelandverse,...

00:39.690 --> 00:44.261
...enhanced actual reality without silly-looking headsets.

00:45.277 --> 00:48.917
In our open world experience, everything is real...

00:54.726 --> 00:57.484
...and has been for millions of years.

01:01.953 --> 01:06.991
It's completely immersive with water that's wet,...

01:12.039 --> 01:13.806
...with humans to connect with.

01:15.452 --> 01:16.567
You're human, right?

01:18.997 --> 01:19.941
Isn't she funny?

01:22.631 --> 01:27.558
In the Icelandverse, there's real moss you can look at,...

01:28.007 --> 01:29.254
Please don't touch it.

01:29.553 --> 01:30.619
It's very delicate.

01:30.991 --> 01:33.562
...skies you can see with your eyeballs,...

01:34.131 --> 01:36.458
...volcanic rocks you can caress,...

01:36.798 --> 01:40.571
...really big geysers you can observe from a safe distance;...

01:40.705 --> 01:41.865
...birds you can watch,...

01:43.203 --> 01:45.542
They're really cute, but a bit stupid.

01:46.415 --> 01:49.937
...waterfalls you can stand near, like this one, that one,...

01:50.179 --> 01:51.565
...this one, that one...

01:52.031 --> 01:52.973
...and even this one;...

01:53.389 --> 01:54.747
...horses you can ride...

01:55.150 --> 01:56.590
...with hair you can touch.

01:57.187 --> 02:01.555
The Icelandverse is a world with possibilities so endless,...

02:02.158 --> 02:03.303
...they'll be here forever.

02:03.777 --> 02:09.172
So join us today or tomorrow or whenever.

02:09.677 --> 02:11.209
We are really easygoing.

02:12.550 --> 02:15.355
