Mr. Smith, can you please give me your best offer?

00:03.321 --> 00:04.208
Sure, Mr. Mark.

00:04.308 --> 00:11.193
I can give you fifteen seconds of airtime for 2,500 dollars if you sign a contract for one hundred such ads.

00:12.167 --> 00:13.559
But, your price is too high.

00:13.899 --> 00:17.101
I am getting a quote for 2,000 dollars from a rival network.

00:17.692 --> 00:18.550
There's a good reason.

00:18.647 --> 00:21.848
Their viewership is also 30 percent smaller than ours.

00:22.174 --> 00:24.385
It actually works out to be more expensive.

00:25.537 --> 00:28.367
Well, I never negotiated the deal with them.

00:28.657 --> 00:33.685
Let's do this: give me a rate of 2,000 dollars, and I'll sign the contract.

00:34.533 --> 00:35.802
I don't think we can afford it.

00:36.839 --> 00:37.936
Check it up with your boss.

00:38.117 --> 00:39.795
I am sure he'll give you a go-ahead.
