How well do you handle stress and pressure?

00:03.461 --> 00:05.167
I'd say I'm pretty good at handling stress.

00:06.439 --> 00:11.821
Part of that is having a very effective management of the workload that's in front of you...

00:11.964 --> 00:13.931
...whether that be having a very tight schedule,...

00:14.023 --> 00:16.157
...or making sure that you're hitting those deadlines.

00:16.522 --> 00:18.183
I think it's also really important to realize...

00:18.268 --> 00:20.391
...that there will be stress in the work environment,...

00:20.773 --> 00:24.145
...but not letting that negatively affect your work or your production.

00:24.657 --> 00:25.577
That's excellent!
