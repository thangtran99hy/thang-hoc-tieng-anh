Hey, Lawrence.

00:03.000 --> 00:03.843
Happy Monday.

00:03.937 --> 00:04.315
Happy Monday.

00:04.969 --> 00:06.029
Did you have a good weekend?

00:06.159 --> 00:07.190
Yeah, really good weekend.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.082
It was a bit busy, but had a lot of fun.

00:09.200 --> 00:09.667
How about you?

00:10.109 --> 00:11.203
Yeah, mine was good.

00:11.373 --> 00:13.081
I just had a relaxing one.

00:13.400 --> 00:13.633
Yeah?

00:13.754 --> 00:14.213
Had a big week?

00:15.008 --> 00:16.793
Yeah. Well, first week on the new job.

00:16.997 --> 00:19.640
So, yeah, I just wanted to chill out with my family at home.

00:19.997 --> 00:21.208
How are you settling in with everything?

00:21.389 --> 00:22.581
Not too bad.

00:23.001 --> 00:24.659
It's been a steep learning curve, though.

00:24.975 --> 00:25.788
Yeah, I can imagine.

00:25.978 --> 00:28.587
I've been here for four years and I only recently switched departments.

00:28.733 --> 00:29.471
Oh, really?

00:29.601 --> 00:30.439
When did that happen?

00:30.749 --> 00:31.849
About two months ago.

00:32.099 --> 00:34.849
I mean, not much has changed, but this is new stuff to learn.
