00:00.505 --> 00:03.445
Cold, distant and mysterious.

00:03.739 --> 00:09.881
For decades after its discovery in 1930, little was known about the geology of Pluto.

00:10.305 --> 00:15.754
NASA's New Horizons probe was the first spacecraft to explore Pluto up close...

00:16.097 --> 00:18.617
...and it sent back some fascinating images.

00:19.087 --> 00:24.238
The patterns can be seen across the smooth surface of a basin filled with nitrogen ice.

00:24.936 --> 00:30.220
Now, a team of researchers has a new explanation for Pluto's mysterious polygons.

00:36.564 --> 00:39.933
Looking at New Horizons' high-resolution images of Pluto,...

00:40.182 --> 00:45.365
...several researchers were intrigued by markings in the region known as Sputnik Planitia,...

00:45.779 --> 00:50.312
...where dark lines formed geometric shapes several tens of kilometers wide.

00:50.619 --> 00:53.410
Even though Sputnik Planitia is made of solid ice,...

00:53.642 --> 00:57.400
...slow-moving currents are still the most likely explanation.

00:57.705 --> 01:00.158
The convection currents that make these kinds of patterns...

01:00.326 --> 01:02.939
...are usually driven by heating from below,...

01:03.478 --> 01:06.604
...but there was something about the patterns on Pluto's surface...

01:06.912 --> 01:09.968
...that didn't quite fit with the idea of convection currents...

01:10.095 --> 01:12.429
...being driven by Pluto's internal heat.

01:13.137 --> 01:16.582
The visible lines delineating the polygons are troughs,...

01:16.837 --> 01:20.751
...showing that the convection currents must be rising up in the center of each shape...

01:21.000 --> 01:22.557
...and sinking at the edges,...

01:22.908 --> 01:25.799
...the opposite to what you'd get if you were heating from underneath.

01:26.233 --> 01:30.713
To explain this cooling, Stephane and his team turned to sublimation.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.538
This is the process, similar to evaporation,...

01:33.871 --> 01:39.031
...by which the nitrogen ice of Sputnik Planitia turns from a solid straight into a gas.

01:39.309 --> 01:43.686
To test this theory, the team developed a computer simulation of the surface.

01:44.502 --> 01:50.239
Their model shows, for the first time, that sublimation can drive planetary-scale patterns.

01:50.873 --> 01:52.905
The team are confident in their findings,...

01:53.210 --> 01:57.680
...but it might be a while before all their hypotheses can be fully tested.
