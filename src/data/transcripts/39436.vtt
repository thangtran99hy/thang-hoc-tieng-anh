A personal narrative is a true story about your life.

00:04.202 --> 00:06.479
You write about something that has happened to you.

00:08.375 --> 00:12.131
Pre-writing is what you do before you write your story.

00:12.529 --> 00:14.402
You make a plan for your writing.

00:14.964 --> 00:18.714
You think about what will go on each page you write.

00:20.521 --> 00:24.266
I have already brainstormed and chosen a topic for my story.

00:24.771 --> 00:27.900
So now I'm ready to plan and pre-write.

00:29.048 --> 00:31.983
I'm going to write about when I got my new dog.

00:33.965 --> 00:37.805
So, first I need to think about what important things happened...

00:37.969 --> 00:39.127
...that I'm going to write about.

00:39.996 --> 00:42.781
I have four pages, so I'm going to think about...

00:42.909 --> 00:45.127
...what will go on each page.

00:46.709 --> 00:50.672
The first thing that happened was my mom told me I could get a dog.

00:51.757 --> 00:55.033
Then we went to the store because they have some dogs...

00:55.145 --> 00:56.645
...that needed to be adopted.

00:58.090 --> 01:02.981
Next, we looked at all the dogs and we chose the one that we wanted.

01:03.729 --> 01:08.471
And then last, we got the dog some food and some toys on our way home.

01:10.177 --> 01:12.600
So now, I have a plan for my story.

01:13.162 --> 01:14.742
When I'm ready to write my draft,...

01:15.087 --> 01:18.950
...I can look at my plan to remember what to write on each page.
