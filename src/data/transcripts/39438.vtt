00:01.452 --> 00:03.359
Why can you see the moon during the day?

00:08.161 --> 00:10.023
We think of the moon as a nighttime object...

00:10.158 --> 00:13.051
...because it's often shown that way to us in books and movies.

00:13.251 --> 00:16.963
Even the weatherman uses the sun as a symbol for day and the moon for night,...

00:17.415 --> 00:21.180
...but the moon actually spends almost as much time in the daytime sky as the night.

00:21.388 --> 00:23.142
You just have to look a little harder to see it.

00:23.527 --> 00:25.770
Let's think about why we can see the moon at night at all.

00:26.076 --> 00:28.615
Unlike our sun, the moon doesn't create its own light.

00:28.769 --> 00:32.164
We can only see it because light from the sun is reflecting off of its surface.

00:32.423 --> 00:33.659
The same is true during the day,...

00:33.863 --> 00:37.466
...and unlike the stars, which are also still up there during the day,...

00:37.632 --> 00:39.799
...but we can't see them because the sky is too bright,...

00:39.925 --> 00:42.582
...the moon actually shines bright enough that you can see it day or night...

00:42.662 --> 00:44.203
...as long as it's in the right part of the sky.

00:44.805 --> 00:47.543
During a full moon, the moon is opposite the sun in the sky.

00:47.876 --> 00:50.501
That's why we can see the full phase of the moon reflecting sunlight.

00:50.649 --> 00:53.726
As the Earth rotates, the moon rises just as the sun sets,...

00:53.815 --> 00:55.631
...but just on that one day of the month.

00:55.815 --> 00:58.801
In the days before a full moon, if you look in the eastern sky,...

00:58.979 --> 01:01.880
...you can find the almost full moon rising before the sun sets.

01:02.220 --> 01:05.053
In the days after a full moon, you can look in the western sky...

01:05.158 --> 01:07.306
...and find the moon setting after the sun has come up.

01:07.574 --> 01:11.047
Over the last year, I've actually made a game of timing my daily bike ride...

01:11.137 --> 01:13.201
...to see if I can spot it in the daytime sky,...

01:13.339 --> 01:14.805
...but it will keep you on your toes.

01:14.918 --> 01:18.523
It sets about 50 minutes later each day as it marches through its phases.

01:18.685 --> 01:20.478
So, keep your eyes peeled and keep looking up.

01:20.723 --> 01:21.795
Maybe you can spot it, too.
