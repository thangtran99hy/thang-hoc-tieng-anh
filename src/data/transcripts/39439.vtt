00:00.054 --> 00:03.111
Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved...

00:03.238 --> 00:06.353
...for watching Joss Whedon's brilliant new series "Firefly."

00:08.665 --> 00:10.215
Does that really need to be in the agreement?

00:10.899 --> 00:12.134
Might as well settle it now.

00:12.272 --> 00:13.268
It's gonna be on for years.

00:15.456 --> 00:16.297
Initial here.

00:18.381 --> 00:19.591
All right!

00:19.746 --> 00:21.687
That's television and movies.

00:23.611 --> 00:25.865
Section 9, miscellany.

00:26.254 --> 00:30.312
The apartment's flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure.

00:32.264 --> 00:33.229
We have a flag?

00:44.047 --> 00:45.319
Never fly it upside down.

00:46.997 --> 00:48.507
Unless the apartment is in distress.

00:49.549 --> 00:53.411
And next, if either of us ever invents time travel,...

00:53.513 --> 00:56.309
...we agree our first stop will be this meeting today...

00:56.400 --> 00:58.047
...in precisely five seconds.

01:00.761 --> 01:01.411
Okay.

01:13.714 --> 01:14.781
Well, that's disappointing.
