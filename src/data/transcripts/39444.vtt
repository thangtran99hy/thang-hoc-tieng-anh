Dan Osgood.

00:04.272 --> 00:05.433
Dan? Mark Curtis.

00:05.667 --> 00:06.540
I'm glad you're there.

00:06.964 --> 00:07.535
Hey, Mark, what's up?

00:08.733 --> 00:10.094
I'm in kind of a panic here, Dan.

00:10.466 --> 00:13.094
Do you remember that new set of assembly line that corp dropped on us?

00:13.401 --> 00:15.507
You know, we were talking about it over lunch last week.

00:15.717 --> 00:16.303
Oh, yeah.

00:16.984 --> 00:18.292
Well, the schedules changed...

00:18.527 --> 00:22.092
...and I need a new 35 PTH in here tomorrow.

00:22.918 --> 00:25.876
Tomorrow, that can be tough, but I'll see what I can do.

00:26.865 --> 00:28.839
I wouldn't ask, Dan, but it's critical.

00:29.529 --> 00:30.241
I understand.

00:30.319 --> 00:32.467
I'll do some checking and I'll see what I can come up with.

00:33.105 --> 00:33.901
All right, thanks.

00:34.224 --> 00:34.976
I'll sit tight.
