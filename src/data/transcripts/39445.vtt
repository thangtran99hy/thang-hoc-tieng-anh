Mark Curtis.

00:04.297 --> 00:05.750
Mark, it's Dan Osgood.

00:06.243 --> 00:07.146
Hey, that was fast.

00:07.331 --> 00:08.129
What did you find out?

00:09.179 --> 00:10.342
Okay, here's the deal.

00:10.844 --> 00:14.559
We don't have the tool that you need, but I did find one in our Newark branch.

00:15.472 --> 00:16.689
Can I get it tomorrow?

00:17.509 --> 00:18.777
Actually, I can do you one better.

00:19.041 --> 00:21.723
It turns out my old assistant works at the Newark branch.

00:21.933 --> 00:24.739
He's bringing your tool to the airport now for counter-to-counter delivery.

00:25.190 --> 00:27.499
It should be in your airport by 7 o'clock tonight.

00:28.201 --> 00:29.944
Oh! That's fantastic, Dan!

00:30.362 --> 00:31.601
I owe you big time.

00:32.768 --> 00:33.557
Glad we can help.

00:33.853 --> 00:35.331
Let me give you the tracking numbers you need.
