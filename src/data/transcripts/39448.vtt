00:01.315 --> 00:04.458
We have uncovered wonders undreamt by our ancestors...

00:04.569 --> 00:09.653
...who first speculated on the nature of those wandering lights in the night sky.

00:13.765 --> 00:18.728
We've crossed the solar system and sent ships to the stars,...

00:23.329 --> 00:24.893
...but we continue to search.

00:26.581 --> 00:27.306
We can't help it.

00:29.318 --> 00:36.201
A  central element of the human future lies far beyond the Earth.

01:03.529 --> 01:05.611
If we crave some cosmic purpose,...

01:05.949 --> 01:08.976
...then let us find ourselves a worthy goal.
