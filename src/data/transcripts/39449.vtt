00:08.955 --> 00:10.781
Think of a powerful memory.

00:12.842 --> 00:15.535
Make it the happiest you can remember.

00:17.539 --> 00:21.171
It feels like no time has passed and loads of time has passed.

00:22.489 --> 00:26.113
I think this is the perfect time to sit down with everyone and reminisce.

00:28.679 --> 00:31.099
The thing that scared me the most...

00:32.423 --> 00:35.457
...was the implication that the most meaningful thing in our life is done...

00:36.194 --> 00:38.875
...and there's something so joyous about seeing everyone,...

00:40.348 --> 00:42.089
...and be like "It wasn't though."

00:42.502 --> 00:46.431
One of the highlights of my part was when I had to pretend to be Hermione...

00:46.546 --> 00:47.641
...pretending to be Bellatrix.

00:47.752 --> 00:49.176
I don't like to be kept waiting.

00:49.353 --> 00:50.390
I still got the teeth actually.

00:50.560 --> 00:51.941
I'll put them in if you want.

00:52.368 --> 00:55.957
My sister has children who were then around 10, 11, 12...

00:56.156 --> 00:58.715
...and I said, "Martha, I don't know about this Voldemort."

00:58.890 --> 01:00.788
"What?! You're being asked to play Voldemort?!"

01:02.607 --> 01:03.713
"You've got to do it!"

01:05.786 --> 01:08.321
I wouldn't be the person I am without so many people here.

01:09.111 --> 01:11.126
It's a very heartwarming thing 'cause I've watched you grow up,...

01:11.222 --> 01:13.605
...and I've seen kind of every stage of your life.

01:14.494 --> 01:17.642
When things get really dark and times are really hard,...

01:17.777 --> 01:20.946
...there's something about Harry Potter that makes life richer.

01:21.543 --> 01:23.219
It's a strong bond that we'll always have.

01:26.543 --> 01:27.251
We're family...

01:27.525 --> 01:29.705
...and we will always be part of each other's life.
