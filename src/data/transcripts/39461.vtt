00:04.318 --> 00:08.987
The world welcomes 2022 with our hopes for the future being tested...

00:09.656 --> 00:12.608
...by deepening poverty and worsening inequality;...

00:13.184 --> 00:16.130
...by an unequal distribution of COVID vaccines;...

00:16.247 --> 00:18.200
...by climate commitments that fall short...

00:18.787 --> 00:21.977
...and by ongoing conflict, division and misinformation.

00:22.933 --> 00:24.981
These are not just policy tests.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.591
These are moral and real-life tests...

00:28.526 --> 00:30.591
...and they are tests that humanity can pass...

00:30.818 --> 00:35.897
...if we commit to making 2022 a year of recovery for everyone.

00:36.935 --> 00:38.461
Recovery from the pandemic...

00:38.597 --> 00:42.177
...with a bold plan to vaccinate every person everywhere;...

00:42.941 --> 00:45.779
...recovery for our economies with wealthier countries...

00:45.890 --> 00:47.445
...supporting the developing world...

00:48.082 --> 00:50.534
...with financing, investment and debt relief;...

00:51.457 --> 00:53.697
...recovery from mistrust and division...

00:53.939 --> 00:57.155
...with a new emphasis on science, facts and reason;...

00:57.881 --> 00:59.257
...recovery from conflicts...

00:59.639 --> 01:03.129
...with renewed spirit of dialogue, compromise and reconciliation...

01:03.800 --> 01:06.818
...and recovery for our planet with climate commitments...

01:06.937 --> 01:09.796
...that match the scale and urgency of the crisis.

01:10.621 --> 01:14.692
Moments of great difficulty are also moments of great opportunity...

01:15.243 --> 01:16.936
...to come together in solidarity;...

01:17.560 --> 01:20.725
...to unite behind solutions that can benefit all people...

01:21.109 --> 01:23.071
...and to move forward together...

01:23.307 --> 01:26.525
...with hope in what our human family can accomplish.

01:27.323 --> 01:31.629
Together, let's make recovery our resolution for 2022,...

01:32.369 --> 01:35.407
...for people, planet and prosperity.

01:35.869 --> 01:39.069
I wish you all a happy and peaceful New Year.
