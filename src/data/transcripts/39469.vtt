In straight turning, the tool is fed parallel to the axis of the work...

00:11.117 --> 00:15.842
...to reduce its diameter so that the final diameter is the same at each end.

00:16.968 --> 00:22.096
Removing a significant amount of material in one pass is called rough turning.

00:23.277 --> 00:26.557
The final lighter cut that creates a smooth surface finish...

00:26.903 --> 00:28.548
...is called finish turning.

00:31.396 --> 00:35.603
Taper turning produces a taper along the axis of the workpiece.

00:36.541 --> 00:40.623
Tapers are produced by offsetting the tailstock from center line...

00:41.040 --> 00:43.382
...or by using a taper attachment.

00:43.987 --> 00:48.091
Short, steep tapers can be turned using a compound rest.

00:50.459 --> 00:54.275
Contour turning or profiling was formally performed...

00:54.377 --> 00:56.583
...by having the single point cutting tool...

00:56.913 --> 00:59.492
...trace a template of the desired profile shape.

01:00.520 --> 01:03.840
This has largely been replaced by CNC turning,...

01:04.428 --> 01:08.463
...in which the desired contour is simply programmed into the machine,...

01:08.835 --> 01:11.518
...which directs a cutting tool to cut the contour.
