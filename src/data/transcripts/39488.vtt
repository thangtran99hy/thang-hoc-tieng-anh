00:01.522 --> 00:04.719
In a world first, a terminally ill man in the U.S....

00:05.043 --> 00:08.505
...has received a heart transplant from a genetically modified pig.

00:08.879 --> 00:12.578
Doctors say 57-year-old David Bennett of Maryland is doing well...

00:12.853 --> 00:15.359
...three days after the experimental procedure.

00:15.699 --> 00:17.123
The surgery took seven hours...

00:17.289 --> 00:20.887
...and was performed by a team at the University of Maryland Medicine.

00:21.415 --> 00:23.121
It was seen as the last hope for Bennett,...

00:23.309 --> 00:25.450
...who had been suffering from terminal heart disease.

00:25.744 --> 00:31.297
That meant doctors were able to receive an emergency authorization for the operation from the FDA.

00:31.622 --> 00:34.241
Dr. Bartley Griffith was Bennett's surgeon.

00:34.505 --> 00:35.076
He's awake.

00:35.278 --> 00:39.133
He is recovering and speaking to his caregivers...

00:39.377 --> 00:45.141
...and we hope that the recovery that he is having now will continue.

00:45.518 --> 00:46.848
We've never done this in a human...

00:47.067 --> 00:50.496
...and I like to think that we have given him a better option...

00:50.911 --> 00:53.779
...than what continuing his therapy would have been,...

00:54.266 --> 00:57.461
...but whether it's a day, week, months, year, I don't know.

00:57.783 --> 00:59.902
The pig heart was provided by Revivicor,...

01:00.107 --> 01:02.966
...a regenerative medicine company based in Virginia.

01:03.563 --> 01:06.732
Prior efforts at pig to human transplants have failed...

01:06.934 --> 01:10.495
...because of genetic differences that caused organ rejection or viruses...

01:10.624 --> 01:12.425
...that posed an infection risk.

01:12.771 --> 01:16.968
Scientists have tackled that problem by editing away potentially harmful genes.
