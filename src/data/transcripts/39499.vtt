Hello, Kim!

00:01.459 --> 00:02.524
Good morning, Ray!

00:03.097 --> 00:04.615
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:05.223 --> 00:06.343
I mean, Jay!

00:07.017 --> 00:09.197
So, tell us about yourself.

00:09.788 --> 00:11.019
Where are you from?

00:11.473 --> 00:11.969
No, wait!

00:12.597 --> 00:15.653
Let me guess... I'm very good at this.

00:16.009 --> 00:17.029
Okay.

00:18.334 --> 00:20.288
Are you from Canada?

00:20.608 --> 00:21.823
Are you Canadian?

00:22.278 --> 00:23.637
No, I'm not.

00:24.085 --> 00:24.461
I'm...

00:24.593 --> 00:25.075
No, wait!

00:25.317 --> 00:26.593
I'm still guessing.

00:28.007 --> 00:29.646
Are you from Brazil?

00:30.054 --> 00:32.800
Brazil is a beautiful country.

00:33.036 --> 00:34.505
Yes, it is.

00:34.759 --> 00:35.634
But no!

00:35.899 --> 00:37.254
I'm not Brazilian.

00:37.442 --> 00:40.251
Hmmm, Kemal Kim...

00:40.653 --> 00:41.240
I know.

00:41.621 --> 00:43.417
Are you from Turkey?

00:45.175 --> 00:47.035
No, I'm not from Turkey.

00:47.487 --> 00:48.722
I'm from Jamaica.

00:48.805 --> 00:50.487
Jamaica!
