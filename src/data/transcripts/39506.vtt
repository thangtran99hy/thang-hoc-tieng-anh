00:00.261 --> 00:05.170
For decades, Ash has been known across the Outlands as a ruthless killer,...

00:07.183 --> 00:08.776
...unburdened by conscience.

00:10.505 --> 00:13.342
But a dark secret lurks beneath the surface.

00:13.465 --> 00:14.579
Hello, can anyone hear me?

00:15.177 --> 00:17.371
Another consciousness is hidden away.

00:20.525 --> 00:21.009
Help!

00:25.887 --> 00:30.786
While Ash has little love for the Legends, in death they become useful.

00:32.316 --> 00:36.725
And analyzing their death box will lead her to their killers.

00:41.597 --> 00:44.087
You made a fatal error crossing me.

00:48.974 --> 00:50.754
Inspired from her old Titan,...

00:51.293 --> 00:55.097
...Ash can throw out a paralyzing snare to bind her prey,...

00:55.367 --> 00:59.318
...allowing her to close in for a more personal finish.

00:59.483 --> 01:02.435
You should have scurried away while you had the chance.

01:06.058 --> 01:09.435
While Ash is a fearsome force from any distance,...

01:10.104 --> 01:15.099
...her most terrifying power is the ability to tear through space itself.

01:18.784 --> 01:21.002
Another precise execution.

01:21.934 --> 01:23.659
I'll see you very soon.

01:24.055 --> 01:26.594
And I will be the last thing you ever see.
