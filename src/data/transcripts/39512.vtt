00:04.599 --> 00:05.499
I want to help people.

00:05.605 --> 00:07.007
I want to encourage people.

00:07.411 --> 00:09.615
I want people to feel that they are valuable.

00:09.997 --> 00:13.730
Using makeup, being a Buddhist monk, talking about equality,...

00:14.004 --> 00:16.426
...they are both coming from the same spirit.

00:21.739 --> 00:23.966
I consider myself gender-gifted...

00:24.595 --> 00:27.839
...because I think I'm both male and female.

00:28.461 --> 00:33.335
Although my body is male, I feel that soul doesn't have a gender.

00:33.829 --> 00:39.231
When I was in the kindergarten, I really loved role-playing as Cinderella or princesses.

00:39.562 --> 00:44.218
Because I was born in a temple, people expected me to be a monk.

00:44.909 --> 00:48.613
People asked me, like "Oh, do you practice chanting?"

00:48.718 --> 00:50.855
Or "Do you have to shave your head?"

00:50.979 --> 00:53.561
And I was like. "Hell, no. I don't want to do that."

00:54.028 --> 00:57.885
I never wanted to become a monk, because I was very skeptical.

00:58.407 --> 01:04.834
When I was in high school, I felt that being a part of the LGBTQ+ community...

01:05.160 --> 01:06.731
...is something to be ashamed of.

01:07.038 --> 01:09.178
During the training to become a Buddhist monk,...

01:09.644 --> 01:13.587
...I asked my master, "Is it okay that I'm a homosexual?

01:13.947 --> 01:16.415
Can I still be welcomed in the Buddhist community?"

01:17.110 --> 01:22.007
And my master said, "In Buddhism, everybody can be equally liberated.

01:22.194 --> 01:26.501
Race, sexuality, disability, it doesn't matter at all."

01:26.727 --> 01:30.451
This is something that I would really love to introduce to the world,...

01:30.737 --> 01:35.806
...because I see some people are not as welcomed or respected because of who they are.

01:42.379 --> 01:45.973
I would love to spread the equality part of the Buddhism.

01:46.305 --> 01:50.226
So, my mission now is to inspire leaders of the world...

01:50.637 --> 01:56.784
...to lift the laws and regulations against LGBTQ+ people and also women...

01:57.116 --> 01:59.849
...so that everybody can be equally respected.

02:00.597 --> 02:05.760
I am both religious and a trendy person so I can be a bridge.

02:06.017 --> 02:11.605
I really want people to feel fluid and flexible because I think we are all unique.

02:12.304 --> 02:16.025
I want to stretch the horizon and inspire people...

02:16.133 --> 02:21.057
...that I can be a monk wearing heels, so you can be who you are.
