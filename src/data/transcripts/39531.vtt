Hello, everyone.

00:04.603 --> 00:07.424
I'm Francine D. Alvarez here with a special report.

00:08.005 --> 00:12.609
Since the events of September 11, 2001, and the anthrax incidents that followed,...

00:12.908 --> 00:16.139
...there's a growing concern about new kinds of terrorist attacks.

00:16.627 --> 00:20.358
A major concern is the threat of attacks on the United States' food supply.

00:20.858 --> 00:24.199
Intelligence reports have found that a terrorist attack on the food supply...

00:24.361 --> 00:27.541
...could pose both severe public health and economic impacts...

00:27.897 --> 00:31.341
...and also damage to public's confidence in the food that we eat.

00:31.944 --> 00:34.164
Both food safety and food defense...

00:34.250 --> 00:37.047
...are focused on keeping the nation's food supply safe.

00:37.540 --> 00:40.122
The difference between the two is that food safety...

00:40.229 --> 00:42.981
...is concerned with accidental contamination of food,...

00:43.394 --> 00:48.695
...while food defense is concerned with intentional contamination or sabotage of food.

00:50.734 --> 00:54.397
Food defense awareness and preparedness starts on the frontline.

00:54.825 --> 00:58.723
Employees are the first line of defense in preventing, detecting,...

00:58.845 --> 01:01.831
...and responding to potential threats to the food supply.

01:03.051 --> 01:06.799
The FDA has created an initiative called "Employees First,"...

01:07.212 --> 01:11.237
...that explains the simple steps frontline food industry workers can take...

01:11.448 --> 01:15.011
...to help protect against intentional contamination of the food supply.

01:16.391 --> 01:20.372
This "first" initiative is designed to help frontline food industry workers...

01:20.477 --> 01:21.801
...remember the following:...

01:22.406 --> 01:26.129
F -  Follow company food defense plan and procedures.

01:26.909 --> 01:30.790
I - Inspect your work area and surrounding areas.

01:31.717 --> 01:35.065
R - Recognize anything out of the ordinary.

01:35.895 --> 01:40.002
S - Secure all ingredients, supplies and finished product.

01:41.139 --> 01:46.463
...and T - Tell management if you notice anything unusual or suspicious.

01:47.599 --> 01:51.231
If the "Employees First" initiative is implemented nationwide...

01:51.344 --> 01:54.020
...by conscientious frontline food industry workers,...

01:54.341 --> 01:57.955
...the nation's food supply can be protected from terrorist threats.

01:58.371 --> 02:01.110
That's the news, I'm Francine D. Alvarez.
