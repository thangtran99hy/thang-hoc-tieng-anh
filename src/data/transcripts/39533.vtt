00:00.313 --> 00:03.403
I do the same things every day.

00:03.937 --> 00:05.032
How does your day go?

00:05.444 --> 00:07.889
I get up at seven in the morning.

00:08.457 --> 00:13.567
I get ready to go to work, and go to work on an overcrowded subway.

00:14.052 --> 00:17.673
Then I start my boring work routine, check emails,...

00:17.866 --> 00:21.462
...attend meetings, and answer calls, and so on.

00:22.091 --> 00:25.332
That's pretty much the same for most office workers.

00:25.994 --> 00:27.863
You could do something fun after work.

00:28.633 --> 00:32.573
By the time I get off work, I just want to go home and rest.
