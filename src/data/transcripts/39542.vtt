How do you spend your free time?

00:02.221 --> 00:06.293
Most weekends, my husband and I work around the house or do shopping,...

00:06.599 --> 00:08.035
...but we both enjoy tennis.

00:08.567 --> 00:11.283
Sometimes, we play at the tennis courts by our house.

00:11.535 --> 00:12.941
Oh, you're a tennis fan!

00:13.728 --> 00:15.373
What do you do on weekends?

00:16.565 --> 00:18.648
I usually join the club activity.

00:19.565 --> 00:21.313
I go out shopping with my friends.

00:22.048 --> 00:24.494
I sometimes help my mother with the housecleaning.

00:25.496 --> 00:27.255
My name is Luna Ruiz.

00:27.423 --> 00:30.699
I am a senior in high school, and I live in New York City.

00:31.011 --> 00:33.059
I was always very adventurous and curious,...

00:33.877 --> 00:35.701
...and that's why I got into computer science...

00:35.873 --> 00:38.147
...'cause I was always curious about how things work.

00:38.543 --> 00:42.914
Well, other than computer science, I'm into sports.

00:43.015 --> 00:44.773
I'm a serious athlete.

00:45.174 --> 00:48.551
I play volleyball, softball, and basketball.

00:48.780 --> 00:51.753
I'm really competitive, as you can see.
