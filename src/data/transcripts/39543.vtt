What's that you're reading, Kathy?

00:01.815 --> 00:04.619
This? Oh, it's a new novel I just bought.

00:04.826 --> 00:07.763
I'm just starting it, but so far it seems pretty good.

00:08.036 --> 00:09.294
Do you like reading books?

00:09.700 --> 00:11.406
Yes, it's one of my hobbies.

00:12.736 --> 00:14.397
What do you like to do, Sophia?

00:15.617 --> 00:18.535
I like to watch movies and to walk on the beach.

00:19.501 --> 00:21.035
What kind of movies do you watch?

00:21.960 --> 00:24.630
I watch all kinds of movies except horror.

00:25.038 --> 00:26.022
How about you, Shin?

00:26.325 --> 00:27.472
Do you like movies?

00:28.131 --> 00:30.861
Yes, but I don't like scary movies, either.

00:31.261 --> 00:32.751
I enjoy comedies a lot.
