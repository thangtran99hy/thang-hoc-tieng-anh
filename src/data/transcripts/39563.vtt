Hello?

00:01.543 --> 00:03.683
Hi, Amanda! What have you been doing?

00:04.218 --> 00:05.831
I've been working all day.

00:06.211 --> 00:07.456
What makes you so busy?

00:08.066 --> 00:10.073
My sister got married last year.

00:10.502 --> 00:12.857
She gave birth to a boy two days ago.

00:13.111 --> 00:14.685
Congratulations!

00:14.941 --> 00:15.803
Thank you.

00:16.041 --> 00:18.639
Now, I have three nieces and two nephews.

00:18.849 --> 00:19.825
I'm so happy.

00:20.065 --> 00:23.022
Wow! You have a lot of nieces and nephews.

00:23.371 --> 00:23.759
Yes.

00:24.083 --> 00:25.569
We are a large family.

00:25.775 --> 00:26.995
That's great!

00:27.227 --> 00:29.169
How many brothers and sisters do you have?

00:29.719 --> 00:32.159
I have one sister and two brothers.

00:32.489 --> 00:33.704
Did they all get married?

00:33.986 --> 00:37.447
Yes, that's why I have many nieces and nephews.

00:37.682 --> 00:39.381
Okay, that makes sense.

00:39.547 --> 00:42.312
My big brother has two daughters and a son.
