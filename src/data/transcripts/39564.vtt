The Lunar New Year has typically been called the Chinese New Year.

00:10.039 --> 00:11.819
That's not wrong and it's not right.

00:12.094 --> 00:14.427
There's a whole another group of Asian countries...

00:14.525 --> 00:16.973
...that also celebrate based on the lunar calendar.

00:17.135 --> 00:19.204
They're really warding off the evil spirits,...

00:19.309 --> 00:21.377
...which is the intention of the dance:...

00:21.691 --> 00:24.566
...to get rid of all the evil things that have happened in the year before...

00:24.733 --> 00:26.817
...and to welcome boldly the new year.

00:31.481 --> 00:33.041
They're not meant to be a lot of money.

00:33.145 --> 00:35.824
It sort of helps people say, "You're part of my life."

00:42.857 --> 00:45.767
If you do present a red envelope, make sure you do it with two hands...

00:46.129 --> 00:47.510
...and that you use new bills...

00:48.600 --> 00:51.533
...because you don't wanna put a ratty five-dollar bill in a red envelope.

00:51.695 --> 00:53.544
That would not be a good idea.

01:02.253 --> 01:05.318
Red is supposed to be prosperity, health,...

01:05.594 --> 01:07.416
...so if you ever went to a Chinese New Year dinner...

01:07.484 --> 01:12.483
...and you're wearing white or black, you should just go home and change.

01:13.097 --> 01:17.971
A lot of the celebratory components center on food, a lot of food.
