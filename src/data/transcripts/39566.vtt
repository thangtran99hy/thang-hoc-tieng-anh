Who is your favorite musician, band, or singer?

00:04.177 --> 00:07.263
So, my favorite musician is Celine Dion.

00:07.523 --> 00:09.655
I love Celine Dion.

00:10.074 --> 00:12.699
I've been listening to her since I was very little.

00:13.242 --> 00:19.041
So, every time I feel down or sad or I feel like doing anything,...

00:19.123 --> 00:21.649
...I just listen to her music and I feel inspiration.

00:21.715 --> 00:23.956
I love that she can speak three different languages.

00:24.395 --> 00:29.395
And, I just feel like her music is all about love and positivity,...

00:29.478 --> 00:30.723
...and I'm like that.

00:31.764 --> 00:33.067
Her voice is so beautiful.

00:33.153 --> 00:36.343
I've been wanting to see her so bad in Las Vegas.

00:36.651 --> 00:40.531
She is my dream concert, so hopefully I can go see her.

00:40.686 --> 00:43.298
But, her music is beautiful, so I love it.
