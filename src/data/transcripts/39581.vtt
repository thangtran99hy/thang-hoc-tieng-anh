If there's one question I get asked a lot, it is why do I wear so many dresses...

00:05.029 --> 00:09.425
...or why do I have so many dresses, or why do I love wearing dresses.

00:09.697 --> 00:13.715
Let's start with the first reason: they are comfortable.

00:14.130 --> 00:18.835
A lot of people out there are always talking about how dresses are so uncomfortable...

00:19.004 --> 00:20.286
...and they don't like wearing them...

00:20.725 --> 00:22.602
...and, that is totally fine.

00:22.818 --> 00:25.839
For me, it is what I am most comfortable in.

00:25.934 --> 00:29.787
Just know that I will choose a flowy dress over jeans.

00:30.005 --> 00:33.059
And, when I go shopping for dresses, there are no issues...

00:33.473 --> 00:36.094
...because I already know what works for my body type.

00:36.207 --> 00:39.353
I know what styles I like, what styles look good on me...

00:39.487 --> 00:41.803
...and what styles I feel confident in.

00:41.965 --> 00:43.953
Plus, they're just so much more comfortable.
