Ryan, look at these pullovers.

00:03.621 --> 00:05.286
Don't they look nice?

00:05.770 --> 00:06.400
Yes.

00:06.915 --> 00:09.618
But I don't like V-necks very much.

00:10.089 --> 00:12.707
I find them a little too casual.

00:13.880 --> 00:16.907
Well, there are other styles too.

00:17.055 --> 00:17.697
Look!

00:18.298 --> 00:20.321
What's your favorite color?

00:21.290 --> 00:24.564
I like all colors except navy blue.

00:25.045 --> 00:28.127
Actually, I really hate navy blue...

00:28.195 --> 00:32.549
...because it reminds me too much of my old school uniform.

00:32.981 --> 00:34.655
How about suits?

00:35.030 --> 00:37.691
Is there a color that you don't like at all?

00:38.258 --> 00:42.646
Well, I don't really like light-colored suits.

00:43.047 --> 00:43.779
You're right.

00:44.148 --> 00:46.849
Light colors are no longer fashionable.

00:48.211 --> 00:51.235
Are white shirts too traditional for you?

00:51.824 --> 00:52.865
Not at all.

00:53.203 --> 00:57.957
Actually, I prefer a suit and tie for important occasions.

00:58.657 --> 01:04.381
Well then, why don't you buy a white shirt and a brightly colored tie?

01:04.863 --> 01:08.360
It's the perfect outfit to create a good impression.
