Hi, Vogue!

00:00.753 --> 00:01.640
It's Hailey Bieber.

00:01.797 --> 00:04.791
Today, I'm going to be showing you guys what I wear in a week.

00:06.607 --> 00:15.317
To start, I wouldn't be in hotel slippers, so I'm going to take these Nike SBs,...

00:15.579 --> 00:18.728
...fold those up like that because I just think it looks cooler.

00:18.959 --> 00:24.066
And then I'm going to put it with this cool like charcoal gray coat...

00:24.203 --> 00:25.934
...that is from Lemaire.

00:26.277 --> 00:29.125
I love a really long sleeve on a coat.

00:29.325 --> 00:30.708
It's everything to me.

00:30.870 --> 00:34.244
I love this sweatshirt because it's like a little bit worn and it's vented,...

00:34.354 --> 00:36.860
...but it is that yummy fleece on the inside.

00:39.285 --> 00:41.846
I love these Margiela pants.

00:41.975 --> 00:43.451
I've had them for a long time.

00:43.647 --> 00:45.255
I love the way that they fit.

00:45.424 --> 00:50.595
This is a very cozy cashmere Bottega Veneta sweater.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.513
I feel like I'm gonna be able to have this sweater for twenty years...

00:53.616 --> 00:57.161
...and it's never gonna go out of style and my kids can steal it from me one day.

00:59.454 --> 01:02.863
So, this is my casual Saturday look,...

01:03.145 --> 01:08.943
...and I am wearing these really cool baggy Natasha Zinko jeans that I love.

01:09.129 --> 01:11.341
They're a little bit more tomboy.

01:11.492 --> 01:14.132
I've been photographed in these jeans quite a few times.

01:14.231 --> 01:15.161
They're my favorite fit.

01:15.326 --> 01:16.174
I love these ones.

01:16.269 --> 01:17.732
I don't care to repeat them.

01:17.891 --> 01:19.707
This sweater is from Mango.

01:19.803 --> 01:21.641
It's so easy to just throw on.

01:21.779 --> 01:22.645
It's a great color.
