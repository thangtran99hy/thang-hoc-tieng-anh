I like dramas that tell stories.

00:04.209 --> 00:08.318
One of my favorites, if not the favorite, is "Vikings."

00:08.821 --> 00:11.055
I started watching it two years ago...

00:11.255 --> 00:14.315
...and I really felt connected with it.

00:14.414 --> 00:18.133
My favorite is Downton Abbey; after that, news programs.

00:19.336 --> 00:21.617
Well, I've just signed on to Netflix...

00:21.790 --> 00:25.757
...so I'm discovering, watching what I want when I want...

00:25.923 --> 00:28.531
...and I think my favorite show at the moment,...

00:28.857 --> 00:33.327
...is, I think it's called "Better Call Saul,"...

00:33.920 --> 00:36.095
...which is a spin-off from "Breaking Bad,"...

00:36.605 --> 00:37.681
...and I enjoy it very much.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.077
I like the character.
