Amongst us in our homes and close to the food we eat,...

00:13.948 --> 00:19.005
...live some mysterious tiny, yet extremely energetic creatures.

00:20.665 --> 00:23.007
Much smaller.

00:25.915 --> 00:31.252
These are microorganisms, extremely small living beings.

00:32.237 --> 00:35.322
There are three different types of microorganisms.

00:36.233 --> 00:41.289
The good ones help to produce foods and drinks such as cheese and yoghurt,...

00:41.578 --> 00:44.400
...fermented meat and fermented vegetables.

00:48.431 --> 00:50.955
Some other microorganisms are annoying.

00:51.799 --> 00:53.275
These are the bad ones.

00:53.865 --> 00:56.033
They are responsible for the foul smell,...

00:56.225 --> 00:59.780
...bad taste and repulsive look of rotting food.

01:00.643 --> 01:02.866
But they normally don't cause diseases.

01:03.497 --> 01:08.245
But it's the other kinds of microorganisms that we really need to be afraid of!

01:08.774 --> 01:13.032
They don't cause food to smell bad and they don't change the way it looks.

01:13.511 --> 01:19.254
They are the dangerous ones and it's necessary to be very careful with them.

01:19.679 --> 01:25.697
These are known as pathogenic microorganisms and they can cause severe illnesses...

01:25.929 --> 01:31.851
...such as stomach pains, vomiting, diarrhea, fever and even death!

01:33.549 --> 01:38.088
They are deceitful, invisible and dangerous.

01:39.130 --> 01:42.235
These tiny beings are very, very prolific.

01:42.463 --> 01:47.128
To increase in number they need food, water, time and warmth.

01:47.292 --> 01:50.055
They can multiply very quickly.

01:50.625 --> 01:55.849
Fortunately, no matter how strong and frightening these microorganisms are,...

01:56.165 --> 01:59.299
...they are preventable and vulnerable.
