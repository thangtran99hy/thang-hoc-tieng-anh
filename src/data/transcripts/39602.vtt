Six Simple Steps to Avoid Food Poisoning.

00:05.687 --> 00:06.325
Hey!

00:06.571 --> 00:07.185
Psst!

00:07.510 --> 00:10.051
It's two days past my use by date,...

00:10.261 --> 00:12.960
...and it's about time I was thrown in the bio waste.

00:13.586 --> 00:14.789
Listen carefully.

00:15.237 --> 00:18.334
I'll tell you how to avoid many bouts of food poisoning.

00:18.803 --> 00:20.714
Remember these six steps.

00:21.625 --> 00:25.715
1. Wash your hands thoroughly before preparing food...

00:26.053 --> 00:28.762
...and in all different stages of food preparation.

00:29.333 --> 00:32.793
Do  not prepare food if you or your children are ill.

00:33.654 --> 00:36.100
2. Use clean equipment.

00:36.573 --> 00:39.646
Do not use the same equipment for different foodstuffs...

00:39.905 --> 00:42.402
...such as meat, bread and vegetables.

00:42.946 --> 00:47.014
If you do, make sure to thoroughly wash it in between steps.

00:47.537 --> 00:49.894
Also, remember to wash your hands.

00:50.192 --> 00:52.870
It prevents microbes from spreading.

00:53.821 --> 00:58.329
3. Wash all vegetables, fruits and berries.

00:59.055 --> 01:02.279
They are a surprisingly common cause of food poisoning.

01:02.912 --> 01:06.190
Boil frozen berries sourced from abroad.

01:07.261 --> 01:11.158
4. Make sure that meat is thoroughly cooked.

01:11.591 --> 01:15.772
Cook mincemeat, poultry and pork until it is well-done.

01:16.376 --> 01:20.213
Cuts of beef and lamb can be left medium on the inside.

01:21.703 --> 01:24.845
5. Serve food immediately.

01:25.265 --> 01:29.157
Keep hot food hot and cold food cold or chilled.

01:29.924 --> 01:34.869
Put any leftover food in a cold water bath or in a smaller container...

01:35.127 --> 01:37.761
...and refrigerate it as soon as possible.

01:38.801 --> 01:43.646
6. Store your ingredients and food at the correct temperatures...

01:43.743 --> 01:46.305
...to prevent bacteria from reproducing.

01:46.993 --> 01:50.684
Check the use by and best before dates on the packaging.

01:51.803 --> 01:52.501
Oh no!

01:52.860 --> 01:54.961
I've got salmonella bacteria.

01:55.503 --> 01:58.982
Remember what I said and throw me in the bio waste.

01:59.471 --> 02:00.140
Ciao!
