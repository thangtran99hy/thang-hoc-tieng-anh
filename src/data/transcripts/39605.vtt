Favorite pet?

00:06.524 --> 00:09.631
I mean, I don't have any pets, but I'd love to maybe get a dog.

00:10.194 --> 00:11.317
Dogs. I got two of them.

00:11.500 --> 00:13.293
Two French bulldogs, loves of my life.

00:13.654 --> 00:19.075
I think I'd get a bigger dog, like a husky or Golden Retriever, or something like that.

00:19.986 --> 00:20.459
Dogs.

00:21.357 --> 00:23.230
They're just a lot better than cats.

00:24.128 --> 00:24.623
Dog.

00:26.813 --> 00:27.286
Dogs.

00:27.371 --> 00:30.813
I love how every day, they're always so happy to see you.

00:30.913 --> 00:32.205
They're just fun companions.

00:32.540 --> 00:33.784
Dogs, I think you know...

00:34.238 --> 00:34.985
I got one.

00:35.129 --> 00:36.571
She's the best thing ever.

00:36.678 --> 00:39.229
She's always happy to see you right when you walk in that door.

00:39.750 --> 00:40.539
I don't like pets.

00:41.347 --> 00:43.181
I've never been a dog or a cat person or anything.
