I think Korea's winter is so cold.

00:03.881 --> 00:05.567
Are you not used to cold weather?

00:05.856 --> 00:06.901
Definitely not.

00:07.097 --> 00:09.013
I'm from Miami.

00:09.659 --> 00:12.117
Miami is warm all year round, right?

00:12.272 --> 00:13.035
Yes.

00:14.195 --> 00:19.014
Another thing I can't stand is the rainy season in summer.

00:19.783 --> 00:21.183
I don't like it, either.

00:21.311 --> 00:22.697
It gets so humid.

00:24.127 --> 00:28.837
However, I bet Korea has the most beautiful autumns.

00:29.070 --> 00:29.768
I agree.
