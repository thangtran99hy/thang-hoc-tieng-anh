Hello, this is Rena.

00:02.575 --> 00:03.889
Hi Rena, it's Liz.

00:04.099 --> 00:04.465
Oh!

00:04.729 --> 00:06.185
Hey, Liz! How are you?

00:06.259 --> 00:06.941
I'm fine.

00:07.425 --> 00:09.241
Hey, I haven't seen you in a while.

00:09.496 --> 00:11.101
Do you want to hang out this weekend?

00:11.665 --> 00:12.077
Yeah.

00:12.713 --> 00:15.083
How about doing something on Saturday?

00:15.726 --> 00:18.435
Yeah, I was thinking we could go to the beach.

00:18.819 --> 00:24.521
Oh, you know, I'm busy in the afternoon, so I probably can't go to the beach.

00:25.383 --> 00:28.781
But I heard there's a really good band playing downtown that night.

00:29.237 --> 00:30.239
Oh, okay.

00:30.453 --> 00:31.817
A concert sounds great.

00:32.593 --> 00:34.489
Do you want to have dinner before?

00:34.835 --> 00:36.381
We could eat at my house.

00:36.656 --> 00:37.113
Sure!

00:37.627 --> 00:39.272
Is seven o'clock too early?

00:39.467 --> 00:40.898
No, that's perfect.

00:41.295 --> 00:44.231
Okay, I'll see you Saturday night at seven o'clock.

00:44.729 --> 00:46.661
Great, I'm looking forward to it.
