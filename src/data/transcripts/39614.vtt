Love is potentially the most intensely thought about thing in all of human history...

00:04.551 --> 00:08.765
...and despite centuries upon centuries of obsession, it still overwhelms us.

00:09.433 --> 00:12.355
Some say it's a feeling, a magical emotion,...

00:12.457 --> 00:14.748
...a feeling for someone like you've never felt before.

00:15.559 --> 00:19.842
But feelings are fluid, not very concrete foundation for a definition.

00:20.177 --> 00:21.970
Sometimes, you hate the person you love.

00:22.582 --> 00:26.869
Plus, come on, you've felt feelings like it before, sort of in miniature.

00:27.234 --> 00:30.411
Your relationships with your family shape your relationships with partners...

00:30.695 --> 00:34.047
...and your love for your partner may be in its own dynamic relationship,...

00:34.163 --> 00:35.724
...healthy or totally weird,...

00:35.975 --> 00:37.900
...with the love of your parents and siblings.

00:38.072 --> 00:41.507
Love is also a set of behaviors we associate with the feeling:...

00:41.996 --> 00:46.101
...holding hands, kissing, hugging, public displays of affection,...

00:46.536 --> 00:50.494
...dating, marriage, having kids or just sex,...

00:50.846 --> 00:54.352
...but these loving actions can be subjective or culturally relative.
