00:00.259 --> 00:02.113
But, if love is a thing that we can define,...

00:02.206 --> 00:04.850
...then how can it mean opposite things for so many people?

00:05.252 --> 00:06.803
So, maybe love's all just in your head,...

00:07.084 --> 00:09.607
...a personal mystery winding through your neural pathways...

00:09.701 --> 00:12.895
...and lighting up pleasing, natural rewards in your nervous system.

00:13.605 --> 00:15.282
Perhaps these rewards are addictive.

00:15.575 --> 00:19.059
Perhaps love is a temporary or permanent addiction to a person,...

00:19.343 --> 00:21.397
...just like a person can be addicted to a drug.

00:22.111 --> 00:24.171
I don't mean to be edgy like some pop song.

00:24.381 --> 00:27.922
Evidence shows that chemicals in your brain stimulated by another person...

00:28.031 --> 00:30.121
...can make you develop a habit for that person.

00:30.325 --> 00:34.097
That person comes to satisfy a physiological craving, and you want more.

00:34.611 --> 00:37.585
But then sometimes, slowly or suddenly, you don't.

00:37.949 --> 00:41.029
You've fallen out of love, become unaddicted, for a spell.

00:41.451 --> 00:42.160
What happened?

00:42.489 --> 00:44.833
Does one develop a tolerance or hit a limit?

00:45.118 --> 00:48.237
Why do some lovers stay addicted to each other their entire lives?

00:48.429 --> 00:51.363
Perhaps to create new lives, to proliferate their species.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.264
Maybe love is just human DNA's optimal method...

00:54.377 --> 00:56.172
...for bringing about its own replication.

00:56.411 --> 00:59.656
There are evolutionary arguments regarding every human mating behavior,...

00:59.957 --> 01:02.241
...from how we display ourselves to potential mates,...

01:02.478 --> 01:05.532
...to how we treat each other in relationships, to how we raise kids.

01:06.143 --> 01:09.778
Thus, some argue that the feeling you think you feel in your soul...

01:10.081 --> 01:12.908
...is just biology's way to make you continue our species.

01:13.194 --> 01:16.160
Nature has selected you to have crushes on hotties...

01:16.489 --> 01:18.932
...just like it makes monkeys have crushes on hot monkeys...

01:19.282 --> 01:20.845
...and biology marches on.
