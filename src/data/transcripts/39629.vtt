Hello! This is Jim.

Hi, Jim! Eddie here.

00:06.292 --> 00:08.471
Oh, hello! How's it going?

00:08.729 --> 00:09.483
Good, thanks.

00:10.007 --> 00:14.011
I just wanted to let you know that Linh and I will come to the party on Friday.

00:14.155 --> 00:15.733
Ah, great news!

00:15.942 --> 00:17.545
What time should we come over?

00:17.801 --> 00:20.421
About around 7:30?

00:20.662 --> 00:23.403
OK. Is there anything we can bring?

00:24.041 --> 00:25.781
Should we bring some food too?

00:26.939 --> 00:29.561
No, it's OK. I'll provide the food.

00:29.801 --> 00:31.730
OK. See you Friday then.

00:32.035 --> 00:32.639
See you, Eddie.
