Have a nice day at work, Marsha!

00:03.675 --> 00:04.717
You too, Anna.

00:05.033 --> 00:05.898
Oh, wait.

00:06.714 --> 00:09.107
Do you have pen and paper I can borrow?

00:09.236 --> 00:10.136
Of course.

00:18.269 --> 00:18.931
Hey!

00:19.481 --> 00:21.052
Could I borrow your phone just for two seconds?

00:22.683 --> 00:22.897
No.

00:23.113 --> 00:24.625
I know it's super weird, we don't even know each other...

00:24.717 --> 00:27.143
...but I'm going to stand right here, and I'm just going to make one quick call.

00:28.009 --> 00:29.089
It means so much.

00:29.357 --> 00:29.705
Thank you.

00:29.921 --> 00:30.117
Thank you.

00:30.182 --> 00:30.814
I appreciate it.

00:30.907 --> 00:31.457
You're a good guy.
