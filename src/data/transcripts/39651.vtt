00:00.141 --> 00:00.883
Here's the big one.

00:01.031 --> 00:04.475
The 2014 Olympic slalom champion Mikaela Shiffrin…

00:04.746 --> 00:09.016
…has already put that nightmare off 48 hours ago, the crash after the fifth gate.

00:09.099 --> 00:10.848
No, it isn't, and she's gone again.

00:10.939 --> 00:11.751
And Shiffrin,...

00:12.001 --> 00:16.527
...same mistake as the giant slalom and about the same number of gates as well.

00:16.856 --> 00:21.615
Four, five turns into the challenge, and the big favorite for the USA,...

00:21.837 --> 00:27.794
...Mikaela Shiffrin, crashes out for a second time of asking…

00:28.270 --> 00:33.020
…what was a shame two days ago is now a nightmare today,...

00:33.365 --> 00:37.741
...serious psychological issues and problems for Shiffrin.

00:37.967 --> 00:41.659
She cannot get those skis to work on this snow.

00:42.954 --> 00:46.600
Wow, no words there, goodness me; poor, poor Shiffrin.

00:47.383 --> 00:49.206
Very similar to the giant slalom.

00:49.637 --> 00:50.692
First of all, how are you?

00:52.541 --> 00:55.237
Right now, I've definitely been better, but…

00:55.614 --> 01:01.229
…I've also been worse so, all in all, pretty medium.

01:02.061 --> 01:05.079
We saw you sitting up there alone; what went through your mind?

01:07.175 --> 01:11.403
I guess I just wanted to,…

01:13.907 --> 01:22.150
…I don't know, take a pause and try to process or try to understand…

01:23.817 --> 01:25.118
…what I really did wrong...

01:26.814 --> 01:32.107
...not really on that turn, but just in general what I did wrong during the day…

01:33.193 --> 01:37.303
…or during the weeks or during the years or whatever,…

01:40.057 --> 01:45.849
…but when I had a mentality that I actually thought would be quite strong today,...

01:48.599 --> 01:50.803
...it ended up being totally the opposite.
