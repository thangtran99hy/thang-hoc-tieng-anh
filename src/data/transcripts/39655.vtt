Jonathan, can I borrow your scissors?

Can I borrow your scissors?

00:18.847 --> 00:19.961
Sorry to bother you.

00:21.825 --> 00:27.186
Yes, I can lend them to you, but you must return them.

00:30.241 --> 00:30.903
Come in.

Hey, Nigel.

00:33.291 --> 00:34.255

00:35.101 --> 00:36.508

Can I borrow this?
