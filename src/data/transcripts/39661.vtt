Hello, Mr. Rashid.

00:03.064 --> 00:03.503
Hi!

00:03.584 --> 00:04.037
How are you?

00:04.120 --> 00:05.165
Fine, thank you.

00:05.409 --> 00:06.392
How was your vacation?

00:06.483 --> 00:07.179
It was wonderful.

00:07.519 --> 00:08.669
I'm so happy to hear that.

00:09.035 --> 00:10.069
Was your flight okay?

00:10.381 --> 00:11.709
No. Pretty bad, actually.

00:11.915 --> 00:14.228
It was so bumpy; it was very scary.

00:14.418 --> 00:16.125
Was the hotel room nice?

00:16.379 --> 00:19.212
The room was fine, but it was right next to the cafe,...

00:19.583 --> 00:22.409
...and the music was very loud, I didn't sleep much.
