00:00.073 --> 00:03.769
She was crowned in Westminster Abbey in June 1953,...

00:04.171 --> 00:10.251
...but she became Queen on the 6th of February 1952, the day her father died.

00:10.701 --> 00:14.521
A few years earlier, she'd made this statement of intent.

00:15.750 --> 00:21.521
I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short,...

00:22.408 --> 00:28.271
...shall be devoted to your service and to the service of our great imperial family,...

00:28.571 --> 00:29.857
...to which we all belong.

00:30.503 --> 00:34.926
That imperial family is long gone, but most British people will agree,...

00:34.998 --> 00:39.591
...that seven decades later, her commitment to public service has been fulfilled.

00:39.922 --> 00:44.578
Despite a life of obvious privilege, the Queen retains widespread popular support.

00:45.099 --> 00:49.943
Last year, she lost her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, after 73 years of marriage.

00:50.537 --> 00:55.843
Few could help being moved by her mourning alone at his COVID limited funeral.

00:56.654 --> 00:59.762
Her reign has spanned a period of huge change.

01:00.221 --> 01:04.713
Britain relinquished its empire and grappled with reduced power and influence.

01:05.207 --> 01:08.577
She has held weekly meetings with 14 prime ministers,...

01:09.055 --> 01:12.813
...but has never committed herself to a known political opinion.

01:13.147 --> 01:16.107
I mean she's the most charismatic, sort of photographed,...

01:16.191 --> 01:19.292
...most famous woman in the world, but she's also very enigmatic.

01:19.362 --> 01:23.163
We hardly know her, and I think being able to stay above politics,...

01:23.257 --> 01:26.891
...but seen as relevant and respected has been really important.
