00:00.758 --> 00:04.915
Ladies and gentlemen, our takeover of General Motors is complete.

00:05.147 --> 00:09.721
Dr. Evil, we can now use GM's Ultium platform to power our whole operation.

00:09.923 --> 00:11.292
Now we can reduce tailpipe emissions.

00:11.519 --> 00:16.135
I'm sorry, am I no longer Dr. Evil, I'm Dr. Good now?

00:16.330 --> 00:17.245
I didn't get the memo.

00:17.447 --> 00:20.371
Climate change is arguably the number one threat to the world now.

00:20.551 --> 00:23.560
Dr. Evil, you are the number two threat to the world.

00:23.947 --> 00:26.079
I refuse to be number two, Number 2.

00:26.369 --> 00:27.481
We have to help the planet.

00:27.598 --> 00:29.601
Oh please. Tear...

00:29.795 --> 00:30.427
For my son.

00:32.277 --> 00:33.075
Your son?

00:33.694 --> 00:37.488
I shall name him Baby Me.

00:37.785 --> 00:39.486
No, his name is Kyle.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.231
You must help save the world first...

00:45.405 --> 00:47.613
...then you can take over the world.

00:47.743 --> 00:50.017
Okay, Frau, how about you let me do the business, alright?

00:50.092 --> 00:50.969
Hold on, I've got it.

00:51.275 --> 00:56.067
I will help save the world first then take over the world.

00:56.298 --> 00:57.673
She literally just said that.

00:58.811 --> 01:01.067
Scott, you just don't get it, do you?

01:01.153 --> 01:01.251
What?

01:01.586 --> 01:02.199
What don't I get?

01:02.271 --> 01:02.921
You don't get it.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.471
And you're never gonna get it.

01:04.585 --> 01:06.288
You can't draw me into these little...

01:06.609 --> 01:07.661
You act like a child.

01:07.734 --> 01:08.743
Here it is... you don't get it.

01:08.807 --> 01:09.667
I am an adult!

01:09.866 --> 01:11.758
You can't push my buttons anymore!

01:12.297 --> 01:12.849
Stop!

01:13.547 --> 01:15.361
We'll reduce our carbon footprint.

01:15.511 --> 01:16.183
Whatever.

01:16.353 --> 01:17.136
Okay, let's go!

01:17.513 --> 01:19.042
We're going all electric!

01:20.159 --> 01:21.076
Everybody in!

01:21.723 --> 01:22.745
Not you, Scott.

01:23.511 --> 01:26.766
One day, you're going to run the company, Baby Me.
